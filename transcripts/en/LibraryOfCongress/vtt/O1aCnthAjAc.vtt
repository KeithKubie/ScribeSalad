&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.000
&gt;&gt; Sasha Dowdy: Hello.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.300
Hello. Can everybody hear me?

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.880
Awesome. Welcome, guys.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.740
Welcome to the Library
of Congress.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.200
Who's been here before?

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.500
Oh. Very good.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.000
And everybody here
has now been here.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.610
So that's really exciting.

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.240
So welcome to the
Library of Congress,

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.760
and welcome to the
Young Readers Center.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.020
And what school are
you guys with today?

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.320
Yeah. Shout it out.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:52.620
Shout it out.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.920
&gt;&gt; Ludlow-Taylor.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.220
&gt;&gt; Sasha Dowdy: That's awesome.

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:56.520
Welcome Ludlow-Taylor.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.820
It's so good to have you.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.780
So today we have a very special
program with you, for you guys.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.810
But first I have a question.

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.360
So we're talking
about a woman today.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.820
Do you guys know who it is?

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.260
She lives in New York,
and she holds a torch,

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.100
and she is walking forward.

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.400
Who is it?

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.700
[ Inaudible ]

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.290
Yes. It's the Statue of Liberty.

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.660
You guys are on point, and
maybe you saw something

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:22.960
to give you a clue behind me.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.070
So yes. We're talking about
the Statue of Liberty,

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.280
and specifically a book
called "Her Right Foot"

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.580
about the Statue of Liberty.

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.070
And we have the illustrator,
the artist Shawn Harris,

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.600
who created this book with
Dave Eggers here today with us

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.300
which is really exciting.

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.430
And we're talking about --

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.980
So Shawn Harris is the
illustrator who's here today.

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.370
And he came here all the way
from Morongo Valley, California.

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.890
And he's a musician and he's an
artist and he's worked with tons

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:52.520
of people that you
may actually know.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.190
He has his own band,
the Matches.

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.090
He's also done work with Adele.

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.840
You guys know Adele?

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.950
Yeah. Pretty big deal.

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.960
Snoop Dogg.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.890
Yeah? Maybe you've heard
of a band called 311.

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.190
Yeah? Okay.

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.030
So he's done work with
all these amazing people,

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.520
and so he has this
really cool music career,

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.560
but now he has published a
book with author Dave Eggers.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.600
So he's going to talk
to you about that.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.220
You guys excited?

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.610
So before he comes out
and starts the program,

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.180
I just want to say thank you
to An Open Book Foundation,

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.830
and this is an organization
that's local to DC

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.500
that really cares
about kids reading.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.560
And what do they do to make
sure that kids are reading?

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:37.860
Well, they buy books.

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.790
So all of you guys are
walking away with a book,

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.900
"Her Right Foot," at the
end of the program today.

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.790
So how about we give
them a round of applause?

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.090
Thank you.

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.560
Thank you so much.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.550
It's going to be a good time.

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.070
So how about we get started?

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.510
Welcome, Shawn Harris.

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.530
[ Applause ]

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:58.860
&gt;&gt; Shawn Harris:
Thank you, guys.

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.160
Thank you.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.460
Thank you.

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:02.760
Please. Please.

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:08.020
Please. Well, you guys already
guessed who this book is about.

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.940
"Her Right Foot" is about
the Statue of Liberty.

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.510
So I guess we're done.

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:17.810
That's -- No.

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:19.980
This book is full of all
kinds of interesting things

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.390
that I learned while I
was illustrating the book

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:23.690
about the statue.

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.120
The book does some
kind of cool stuff.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.830
I'm going to let you
decide for yourself.

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:28.130
Can I read you this book?

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:29.450
Is that cool with you guys?

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:30.750
Okay. All right.

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.050
All right.

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:33.610
And for everybody
that has been cutting

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.790
out paper diligently while
you're waiting for me

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.090
to get introduced, thank you.

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:39.820
I will collect that
in a little bit.

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.510
Just hold on to your shapes
right now, and we're going

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.140
to do an art project together.

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.590
But you guys might notice
when I start reading the book

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.490
that I made this whole book
with little cut out pieces

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:52.400
of paper exactly the same
as what you just did.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.190
Yeah. Yeah.

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:58.090
So if you photographed that,
that could be in a book one day.

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:59.390
All right.

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:02.430
Here we go.

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.330
Oh, and you can go
past this video.

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:05.630
Okay. All right.

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:06.930
Let's sync this up.

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.150
Okay. Here are my end papers.

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.580
These are called end
papers right here.

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.320
I'm just testing
you here, Sasha.

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:14.620
These are called end papers.

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.950
I'm going to take the
jacket off of the book.

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:18.250
This is called a jacket.

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.780
It's a very kind of formal
thing that protects the book.

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:25.710
Underneath the jacket you guys
might recognize this tablet.

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.610
This tablet, there's
a date on it.

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.260
It says July 4, 1886.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:32.830
It's interesting.

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:35.070
Does that date sound familiar?

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:36.370
Yeah. Yeah.

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:44.330
1776. You're right [laughs].

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.980
So this is when the "Declaration
of Independence" was signed.

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:52.660
And this is the tablet
that the statue is holding.

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.990
So you can hold this book
and pose like the statue.

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:57.870
Anyway, okay.

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:59.170
Here we go.

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:01.470
"Her Right Foot."

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:03.790
"Her Right Foot."

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:06.940
Said it twice just in case
you missed it that first time.

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:10.540
Okay. You have likely heard
of a place called France.

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:12.820
Is that true?

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:14.360
Yeah. Yeah.

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.140
Okay. Good.

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:17.440
Starting off on the right foot.

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.410
Okay. If you have
heard of France,

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:21.670
you may have heard
of the French.

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:24.420
They are the people
who live in France.

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:28.280
Do we need to move this
while we're doing the --

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:29.580
Is that better?

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:30.880
Okay. Cool.

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.180
We'll put that up in a minute.

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:33.480
All right.

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:34.780
So you have heard of the French.

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:36.080
Where do they live?

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:37.380
France. That's right.

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:38.680
Okay. Cool.

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:39.980
Cool. We're up to speed.

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:41.280
Everyone's on the right page.

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:42.580
You may have also heard

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:45.580
of something called
the Statue of Liberty.

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.090
Right? Right?

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:53.500
Did you know that the Statue
of Liberty comes from France?

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:54.800
This is true.

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.440
This is a factual book.

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.760
One day a Frenchman named
Edouard de Laboulaye had

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:05.060
an idea.

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:07.340
The idea was to celebrate the
hundred years the United States

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:12.370
of America had been around by
giving them a giant sculpture.

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:14.210
So he convinced another
Frenchman,

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:18.510
a Frenchman with an Italian last
name, to design the sculpture.

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:22.130
This artist's name was
Frederic Auguste Bartholdi.

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:25.180
Bartholdi designed the statue.

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:30.980
Now you might see that our
Frenchman here is holding a

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:33.430
banana up in the air.

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:35.510
Does anybody have any idea why?

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:37.980
Is he just -- You have an idea?

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:39.280
Yeah.

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:40.680
[ Inaudible ]

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:41.980
Yeah. It's like the torch.

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:44.900
Right? They don't serve
torches with breakfast.

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:48.510
So you have an idea too?

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:53.900
[ Inaudible ]

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:55.200
Also true.

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:56.500
Also true.

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:58.290
You use what you have, and
if you only have a banana,

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:00.870
but you have an idea and
it involves holding a torch

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:03.490
up high, you're going to hold
that banana up in the air.

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:05.670
And in his other hand you
see he's got something.

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:08.420
He's holding sort
of like a tablet.

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:10.960
Yeah. Yeah.

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:14.060
Yeah. So the Statue of
Liberty is not holding a menu.

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:16.000
What's that?

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.300
You can't see the pictures?

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:18.600
Do you need me to stand?

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:19.900
I can stand back here.

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:21.200
Is that better?

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:22.500
Okay. All right.

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:25.580
Great. You still see?

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:27.300
Okay. Good.

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:29.130
Good. Okay.

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:31.920
Okay. So he first made
the statue very small,

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:33.320
very small models
of the sculpture.

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:34.620
Then larger ones.

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:36.600
And finally the one that we know

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:40.930
which stands 305
feet above the water.

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:42.550
It's tall.

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:45.780
Yeah. This final full
sized version was covered

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:47.200
with a thin copper skin.

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:49.720
The skin is about as
thick as two pennies.

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:51.780
Anybody have two pennies?

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:54.740
It's not very thick.

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:58.250
Right? You'd think she would
get cold standing out there

00:07:58.250 --> 00:07:59.550
in the winter in New York.

00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:00.850
Right? Yeah.

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:02.260
You have two.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.170
He has two coins right here.

00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:05.660
You guys can see.

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:08.970
This is not pennies, but
it's close to the width.

00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:11.310
This is the thickness
of her skin.

00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:13.460
You can barely see that.

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:17.470
Right? That does not
translate on camera here.

00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:20.240
What's that?

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:23.510
Well, we'll find out why she
doesn't fall down in a minute

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:25.250
because they're building
the statue right now.

00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:27.960
So here is Bartholdi
and his team.

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:29.260
He had a team.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:30.770
He didn't like working alone.

00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:33.740
And they're constructing
the statue's hand.

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:36.490
Notice that this hand is
bigger than these men.

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:40.730
Thus they made the
statue in many parts.

00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:42.600
You can see this hand is taking

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:45.920
up the entire warehouse
right here.

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:47.220
You can see that.

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:51.310
That's the actual size
of the men on the hand.

00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:55.540
Yes. You have an idea,
a question, a theory?

00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:58.350
What's that?

00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:00.370
How did they make it bigger?

00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:03.100
Like how did they attach
it to the whole statue?

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:05.910
We'll find out.

00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:07.210
These parts were assembled,

00:09:07.210 --> 00:09:11.360
and that's when they put it
all together, in New York City.

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:13.670
No. No. No.

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:14.970
Wait. Wait.

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:17.540
Wait. First they were
assembled in Paris.

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:18.900
Did you know this?

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:20.650
Ask your friends, and
even your teachers,

00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:23.160
if they knew before the Statue
of Liberty was assembled

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:25.880
in New York, she was first
constructed in Paris.

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:28.340
Your friends and teachers
will be astounded.

00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:29.640
They will be impressed.

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:33.210
Are you impressed,
teachers and friends?

00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:36.080
Yeah. They might think
that you are fibbing,

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:37.800
but you are not fibbing.

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:39.100
This really happened.

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:41.170
The Statue of Liberty stood
there high above Paris

00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:45.060
for almost a year in 1884.

00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:51.390
After they assembled the statue
in Paris, they took it apart.

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:55.510
Okay? "But we just put it
together," the workers said.

00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:58.350
"That is absurd," they said.

00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:01.880
They said all this in French,
the language of the French.

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:06.250
A people who appreciate
the absurd.

00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:08.490
[ Inaudible ]

00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:10.210
Why did they take
it down in Paris?

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:12.780
Because they were
bringing it to America.

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:15.970
It was a gift from
the French, actually.

00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:22.060
In 1885, after they took it
apart, they put the parts

00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:25.060
in 214 crates, put
these crates on a boat.

00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:27.220
The boat was called the Isere.

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:29.780
The boat traveled over the
Atlantic Ocean, and made its way

00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:34.530
to a city called New York
also in a state called --

00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:35.830
&gt;&gt; New York.

00:10:35.830 --> 00:10:37.260
&gt;&gt; Shawn Harris: New York.

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:38.560
In the United States.

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:41.180
Correct. And here they are
traveling across the Atlantic.

00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:42.480
Yes.

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:47.250
&gt;&gt; Then how did it
get to -- How --

00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:52.290
Then how did it get to
New York [inaudible].

00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:55.240
&gt;&gt; No. It was a gift
from the French.

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:57.660
&gt;&gt; Shawn Harris: It was
a gift from the French

00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:01.490
to the United States to help
us celebrate our independence,

00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:05.020
the 100 year anniversary
of our independence.

00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:06.320
So it's coming up.

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:07.620
We're not at 1886 yet.

00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:09.720
We're in about 1884, 1885.

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:12.780
Okay. Hundreds of workers,
perhaps 214 of them,

00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:15.620
took the pieces out
of the 214 boxes,

00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:17.940
then began to rivet
the pieces together.

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:21.530
Assembling the statue took 17
months, and it all happened

00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:24.670
on what was then called
Bedloe's Island right here.

00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:27.790
Does anybody know what
the island is called now?

00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:29.380
&gt;&gt; Liberty Island.

00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:30.680
&gt;&gt; Shawn Harris: Liberty Island.

00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:31.980
Really good.

00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:33.280
Good work.

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:35.270
Yeah. The statue was so big
and prominent they named the --

00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:38.200
They renamed the
island after the statue.

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:41.140
Bartholdi liked to see the
sculpture rise above the harbor.

00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:43.860
Sometimes he'd watch the
construction from the water.

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:45.780
Sometimes he watched
it from the land.

00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:48.470
Usually he was wearing a
sturdy black hat for he,

00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:51.670
like most European men of
the time, and some artists,

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:54.790
favored sturdy black hats.

00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:59.440
You may have noticed by now
that the pictures of the Statue

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:01.780
of Liberty in this book
have her colored brown.

00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:04.610
You may have thought that the
illustrator of this book was not

00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:07.020
so good at his job because
we all know the Statue

00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:09.100
of Liberty is a certain
greenish-blue color.

00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:13.970
Right? But the Statue of
Liberty was made of copper,

00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:16.610
that stuff that pennies are
made out of, and copper starts

00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:18.770
out the color of pennies.

00:12:18.770 --> 00:12:23.430
Brown. Then very slowly
when it's left outside

00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:26.130
for long periods of time,
copper will eventually oxidize.

00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:28.130
And when it does, it turns --

00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:30.030
&gt;&gt; Green.

00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:31.330
&gt;&gt; Shawn Harris: Yeah.

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:33.620
First red, brown, greenish.

00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:38.580
Green. And then that kind
of light teal that --

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:41.430
And that's the color that
we know she is today.

00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:44.040
Right? Crazy.

00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:46.310
So if you left your pennies
out in the New York harbor

00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:51.130
for 100 years you would have the
Statue of Liberty colored penny

00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:52.630
if they were still
made of copper.

00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:54.930
Okay. So the Statue of
Liberty that everyone

00:12:54.930 --> 00:12:58.210
in New York City saw being
constructed was actually brown.

00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:03.590
The Statue of Liberty, in fact,
was brown for about 35 years.

00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:05.310
Yeah. But see.

00:13:05.310 --> 00:13:06.610
We don't know.

00:13:06.610 --> 00:13:08.360
When we look at old pictures
of the Statue of Liberty,

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:11.380
the photography was
all black and white.

00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:12.680
So in our minds we're
like, "Oh, yeah.

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:14.640
That's a big teal statue."

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:17.400
The statue turned
green around 1920,

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:19.090
and it has been this
color ever since.

00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:23.860
And perhaps you already
knew this.

00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:27.240
And you may have known that the
book the statue is carrying,

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:31.210
the one in her left hand,
features the date, July 4, 1776,

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:34.440
on which the "Declaration
of Independence" was signed.

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:38.160
Right? Roman numerals.

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:41.090
And you may know
that the seven spikes

00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:43.310
on her crown represent
the seven seas on Earth,

00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:47.700
and the seven continents,
and the sun rays too.

00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:54.360
And you probably know that the
torch she carries is a symbol

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:59.310
of enlightenment, lighting the
path to liberty and to freedom.

00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:03.810
And you might have known that
at one point Thomas Edison,

00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:06.410
the inventor of the light
bulb and the record player,

00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:10.730
once proposed to have a giant
record player inside the Statue

00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:12.050
of Liberty.

00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:13.590
Yeah. He did.

00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:17.040
He wanted the statue
to be able to speak.

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:20.120
In the end, though, this idea
was considered a little bit

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:21.920
strange, and was not pursued.

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:23.360
They didn't do it.

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:24.820
They didn't do it.

00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:26.120
They -- We kept the light bulb,

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:28.030
but we didn't use
the giant phonograph.

00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:29.610
I mean can you imagine
how hard it would be

00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:33.520
to like clean the dust
off of a giant phonograph?

00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:35.970
You know? Yeah.

00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:37.270
And would she be singing?

00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:39.250
Would she be like singing
an Adele song up there

00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:40.550
in the harbor or something?

00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:42.820
&gt;&gt; They would also
have to clean --

00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:46.720
They would also have to
have big giant records.

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:48.020
&gt;&gt; Shawn Harris: Yes.

00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:49.320
They would.

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:50.620
And then who gets to
choose the record?

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:51.920
It's always, you know --

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:53.220
Oh, is it your turn
to choose the record?

00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:55.720
And everybody [inaudible]
anyway.

00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:57.560
The idea was not pursued.

00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:00.760
Did you know that the interior
of the statue was designed

00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:03.960
by another Frenchman
by the name of Eiffel ?

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:07.120
Does that sound familiar?

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:08.420
Eiffel Tower?

00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:09.730
That's right.

00:15:09.730 --> 00:15:13.660
The same Eiffel who a few
years later would design the

00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:14.960
Eiffel Tower.

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:17.320
I think it was about six years
after he designed the Statue

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:18.770
of Liberty he did
the Eiffel Tower.

00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:21.560
So yeah. Yeah.

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:24.250
Yeah. And did you know

00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:27.460
that while the statue was first
being constructed in Paris,

00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:30.740
a bunch of Parisians, mostly
writers who liked to eat,

00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:34.810
actually dined in the area just
below the statue's knee before

00:15:34.810 --> 00:15:37.110
they even put her torso on?

00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:38.560
This too is true.

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:41.190
While the statue was
rising, Bartholdi set

00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:44.100
up a lunch four stories
up to impress

00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:48.920
and enthrall these French
writers who, being difficult

00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:53.310
to impress and enthrall,
were at least mildly amused.

00:15:53.310 --> 00:15:55.560
Did you say, "How much
did the lunch cost?"

00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:57.820
&gt;&gt; I said how much is four --

00:15:57.820 --> 00:15:59.120
&gt;&gt; Shawn Harris: Oh.

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:00.420
How much is four stories?

00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:01.720
Well, we're on the
second story right now.

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:03.020
Is that right?

00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:04.320
We're on the ground.

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:05.620
Okay. Okay.

00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:08.510
But we did climb
some stairs to get --

00:16:08.510 --> 00:16:13.480
[ Inaudible ]

00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:18.350
So your library at school
is on the third floor.

00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:24.180
So one more floor up and
you're at the statue's knee.

00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:25.480
Yeah. Yeah.

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:29.830
Are you at least mildly amused?

00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:32.040
But there is one thing
that you might not know,

00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:35.430
and this is the central
point to this book,

00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:38.730
a point that the author,
my friend Dave Eggers,

00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:41.670
apologizes for taking
so long to get to.

00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:44.720
The point is that even if
you have seen a picture

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:47.000
of the Statue of Liberty or
many pictures of the Statue

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.830
of Liberty, or even hundreds
of pictures of the Statue

00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:54.010
of Liberty, you have probably
not seen pictures of her feet.

00:16:54.010 --> 00:16:57.860
Have you? Okay.

00:16:57.860 --> 00:17:00.060
Let's check this out.

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:04.180
And even if you have seen
pictures of her feet,

00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:08.430
like this one, you probably
have not seen pictures

00:17:08.430 --> 00:17:10.190
of the back of her feet.

00:17:10.190 --> 00:17:15.170
In particular, her right foot.

00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:25.070
What do you notice when
you see this picture?

00:17:25.070 --> 00:17:26.370
Her foot is up.

00:17:26.370 --> 00:17:27.670
What is that?

00:17:27.670 --> 00:17:28.970
What could that mean?

00:17:28.970 --> 00:17:30.270
What could that mean?

00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:32.610
We notice like this
her foot is up.

00:17:32.610 --> 00:17:33.910
What could that mean?

00:17:33.910 --> 00:17:35.210
&gt;&gt; She's moving.

00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:38.710
&gt;&gt; Shawn Harris:
That she's moving.

00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:40.520
Yeah. She's about
to go somewhere.

00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:42.020
Let's talk about that.

00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:43.620
That's right.

00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:44.920
She is going somewhere.

00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:51.670
She is on the move.

00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:55.850
Let's pause here and
collect ourselves.

00:17:55.850 --> 00:17:57.310
Let's think about this.

00:17:57.310 --> 00:17:58.670
Let's pause here and
think about this.

00:17:58.670 --> 00:17:59.970
Let's discuss this.

00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:01.680
Let's think about
and discuss the fact

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:05.720
that this is the largest
sculpture in all of our land.

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:09.690
And the most iconic symbol of
the United States of America.

00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:12.630
Let's talk about the fact that
the statue has welcomed millions

00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:20.350
of visitors and immigrants to
the United States of America.

00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:23.900
People talk about
her unusual headwear.

00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:26.300
They talk about her gown
which seems a very heavy kind

00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:28.100
of garment which
would likely result

00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:30.870
in serious lower back issues.

00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:35.500
Right? They talk about
her beautiful torch,

00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:38.020
and the severe look on her face.

00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:44.000
But no one talks about the
fact that she's walking.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:50.660
This 150 foot woman is
on the go, like you said.

00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:53.440
Every time we see the Statue
of Liberty in pictures

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:55.110
or any time we imagine
the Statue

00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:57.550
of Liberty we see
her standing still,

00:18:57.550 --> 00:19:02.060
very still, like,
well, a statue.

00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:06.580
But she's moving.

00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:14.340
She weighs 450,000 pounds,
and wears a size 879 shoe.

00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:18.220
What size shoe do you wear?

00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:20.320
No 879, huh?

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:26.120
No. How can we all
have missed this?

00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:28.830
Or even if we saw
this, and noticed this,

00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:33.060
how is it that we have seen and
noticed a 450,000 pound human

00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:34.630
on her way somewhere
and said, "Oh,

00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:39.940
just another 150 foot woman
walking off 150 foot pedestal.

00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:41.350
No big deal."

00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:45.530
Most important, where
is she going?

00:19:45.530 --> 00:19:47.880
Is she going to SoHo
to get a panini?

00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:51.350
Have you ever had a panini?

00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:54.670
Neither have I.

00:19:54.670 --> 00:19:59.110
Is she going to West Village to
look for vintage Nico records?

00:20:03.050 --> 00:20:04.350
No. No. No.

00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:05.650
She's facing southwest.

00:20:05.650 --> 00:20:07.460
So she's facing New Jersey.

00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:14.560
Could she be going to Trenton?

00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:16.040
Wait. No. No.

00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:17.700
No. She's facing southeast.

00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:20.180
So she's not going
to New Jersey.

00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:22.620
But she is going somewhere.

00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:25.220
Where is she going?

00:20:28.150 --> 00:20:30.440
There are certain
things that we know.

00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:32.970
We know that around
her feet are chains.

00:20:32.970 --> 00:20:34.640
They are broken chains, implying

00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:36.690
that she's freed
herself from bondage.

00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:38.820
We know that Bartholdi
wanted us to know this.

00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:40.600
He wanted us to see the chains.

00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:44.140
People have talked
about the chains.

00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:50.440
But few talk about the foot that
is so obviously in midstride,

00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:54.220
about the fact that her entire
right leg is in midstride.

00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:55.520
What does this mean?

00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:56.920
What does this mean
that we often forget

00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:59.670
about the right foot,
the right leg?

00:20:59.670 --> 00:21:03.010
Here's an idea.

00:21:03.010 --> 00:21:05.170
Here's a theory.

00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:07.730
Here's a reminder.

00:21:07.730 --> 00:21:15.160
If the Statue of Liberty is a
symbol of freedom, if the Statue

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:18.820
of Liberty has welcomed
millions of immigrants

00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:22.560
to the United States, then
how can she stand still?

00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:26.800
Liberty and freedom from
oppression are not things

00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:28.190
that you get or grant
by standing

00:21:28.190 --> 00:21:29.880
around like some kind of statue.

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:34.930
No. These are things that
require action and courage

00:21:34.930 --> 00:21:38.170
and an unwillingness to rest.

00:21:38.170 --> 00:21:40.140
The Statue of Liberty
was not built

00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:43.070
to welcome just 1,886 immigrants

00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:46.760
from Italy one certain
Sunday in, say, 1886.

00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:49.590
No. She was built to
welcome 3,000 immigrants

00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:53.660
from Poland the next day, the
next day 5,000 Norwegians,

00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:59.720
after that 10,000 Glaswegians,
then Cambodians, then Estonians,

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:06.250
Somalis, Nepalis,
Syrians, Liberians.

00:22:06.250 --> 00:22:08.700
It never ends.

00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:14.110
It cannot end.

00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:19.150
After all, the Statue of
Liberty is an immigrant too.

00:22:19.150 --> 00:22:22.710
And this is why she's moving.

00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:25.330
This is why she's striding.

00:22:25.330 --> 00:22:30.990
In welcoming the poor,
the tired, the struggling,

00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:37.710
to breathe free, she
is not content to wait.

00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:44.280
She must meet them in the sea.

00:22:49.670 --> 00:22:52.510
And that's the end.

00:22:52.510 --> 00:22:59.470
[ Applause ]

00:22:59.470 --> 00:23:02.090
And because this is
a very special event,

00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:04.060
I'm really honored to be here
at the Library of Congress.

00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:06.630
I actually brought the
original piece that I did

00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:09.750
with construction paper of
this last page of the book.

00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:12.050
Can you guys see this?

00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:16.810
This is the first
time that I did this,

00:23:16.810 --> 00:23:18.490
and then they printed
this in the book.

00:23:18.490 --> 00:23:20.620
And it's the last page.

00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:23.460
Do you guys have any questions

00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:26.980
about the book, the
words or the art?

00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:30.530
Yes. What's your question back
here in the glitter cat shirt.

00:23:30.530 --> 00:23:31.830
&gt;&gt; I have to think about it.

00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:33.130
&gt;&gt; Shawn Harris: You
have to think about it?

00:23:33.130 --> 00:23:34.430
Okay. I'll come back to you.

00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:35.730
Do you want to look at that?

00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:38.440
This is the original of this.

00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:39.740
How did I make it out of paper?

00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:41.350
Well, all I did was I
just cut out the shapes

00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:42.650
and then I glued
them on the page.

00:23:42.650 --> 00:23:45.630
Yeah. You can see it.

00:23:45.630 --> 00:23:48.100
Right? Yeah.

00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:52.840
Yeah. You have a question
right here in the cat ears.

00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:54.750
&gt;&gt; How do you keep
-- How do you --

00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:59.130
How did you make the
Statue of Liberty?

00:23:59.130 --> 00:24:02.100
&gt;&gt; Shawn Harris: Well, I did
not make the Statue of Liberty,

00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:04.430
but the Statue of Liberty
that is right here in my piece

00:24:04.430 --> 00:24:07.050
of art I just -- You know what?

00:24:07.050 --> 00:24:10.850
I cut out a shape,
and before I drew

00:24:10.850 --> 00:24:13.510
on it it didn't really look very
much like the Statue of Liberty.

00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:16.790
It's kind of sort of
a rectangle with an --

00:24:16.790 --> 00:24:20.010
maybe an arm-like shape
protruding in to the air.

00:24:20.010 --> 00:24:22.590
And then I -- See how
I painted the yellow

00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:26.210
and teal paint on
top of that shape?

00:24:26.210 --> 00:24:28.600
And all of a sudden it looked
like the Statue of Liberty.

00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:30.810
That's pretty crazy.

00:24:30.810 --> 00:24:32.110
You should try it.

00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:33.410
You should try it.

00:24:33.410 --> 00:24:34.760
You have a question right
here in the front row?

00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:36.060
Yes?

00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:37.360
&gt;&gt; How did you make
it so realistic?

00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:39.200
&gt;&gt; Shawn Harris: You
think this is realistic?

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:40.500
Thank you.

00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:43.210
I appreciate that.

00:24:43.210 --> 00:24:45.910
Practice. Practice, I guess.

00:24:45.910 --> 00:24:47.210
But you'll see.

00:24:47.210 --> 00:24:48.510
We're going to do an
art project together

00:24:48.510 --> 00:24:49.810
when I pick this
up off the ground.

00:24:49.810 --> 00:24:51.110
We're going to do an art
project together, and you'll get

00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:54.980
to see my work in action, how
I glue everything on the page.

00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:56.280
And you know what?

00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:57.580
It's not different.

00:24:57.580 --> 00:24:58.880
It's not much different
from the way you do things

00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:00.820
at home probably,
which is kind of cool.

00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:04.420
You have a question
right here in the yellow.

00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:09.830
I know. The mouth gets dry when
you talk in front of people.

00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:11.130
Right?

00:25:11.130 --> 00:25:15.230
&gt;&gt; How come on the
-- on that one most

00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:22.020
of the lines are thicker
than the ones on that one?

00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:23.320
&gt;&gt; Shawn Harris: That's
an interesting question.

00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:26.430
She says how come the lines
are thicker than on this one?

00:25:26.430 --> 00:25:29.100
And the answer is I did the ink

00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:31.200
on a different layer
on this one.

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:35.350
So this is the actual paper
that's photographed here,

00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:38.490
but I did the ink on a separate
piece of paper and then scanned

00:25:38.490 --> 00:25:40.870
that in for the book
in case I messed up.

00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:45.010
And then after I decided I liked
it, I went and did my final.

00:25:45.010 --> 00:25:46.880
You have a question.

00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:49.920
&gt;&gt; What -- Did you use -- What
kind of paint did you use?

00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:51.420
Like watercolor?

00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:55.480
&gt;&gt; Shawn Harris: I used mostly
ink, and I used some acrylic.

00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:57.410
And a little bit of watercolor.

00:25:57.410 --> 00:25:59.090
Yeah. So pretty much
anything that was laying

00:25:59.090 --> 00:26:01.660
around that was the right color.

00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:02.960
Let's see.

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:04.260
Another question.

00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:05.560
You have a question.

00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:06.860
&gt;&gt; Why did you choose
to do this book?

00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:08.160
&gt;&gt; Shawn Harris: Why did
I choose to do this book?

00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:09.460
That's a really good question.

00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:15.480
I got to read the
book, and they asked me

00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:20.420
if I would do some samples
in cut paper because they --

00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:24.580
Dave, the author, wanted
this book done in cut paper.

00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:26.380
And so I said, "Oh, yeah.

00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:27.680
No problem.

00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:29.530
I can do my art with cut paper."

00:26:29.530 --> 00:26:33.480
And then I ran home and did some
art to make sure that I could

00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:34.780
because I just told them, "Yes.

00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:36.080
I can do that."

00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:37.380
And I didn't know that I could.

00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:39.460
And I showed it to
him, and he liked it.

00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:42.950
But the reason why I did the
book was I read the manuscript

00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:46.310
which is just the words
without the pictures.

00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:49.780
And I was really inspired.

00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:51.970
I thought it was
a great message.

00:26:51.970 --> 00:26:55.940
I was feeling a little
bit like I didn't --

00:26:55.940 --> 00:26:59.790
I was a bit frustrated, didn't
have a way of communicating

00:26:59.790 --> 00:27:02.980
that I thought everybody
should be welcomed

00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:06.750
in to the United States, and
this book really says that.

00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:08.740
I think my favorite
line from this book is

00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:13.600
when it says the Statue of
Liberty is an immigrant too.

00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:15.490
And I thought about, you know,

00:27:15.490 --> 00:27:18.480
my great grandparents
that immigrated here.

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:21.860
They came over on boats to
seek a better life in America.

00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:25.060
And how I'm just so lucky
to have been born here.

00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:29.380
You know? But people are
arriving here every day

00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:32.590
that are looking for -- that
want their kids to be born here

00:27:32.590 --> 00:27:37.270
like we were or like a lot
of us were, I should say.

00:27:37.270 --> 00:27:41.370
Unless you're Native American,
your family immigrated here.

00:27:41.370 --> 00:27:44.820
And the story of
immigrating to America is

00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:46.400
such an American story, right?

00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:48.750
Like that's who we all are.

00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:51.120
And so it's really important
that we celebrate people

00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:55.460
that have immigrated here and
are immigrating here every day.

00:27:55.460 --> 00:28:00.220
They are really brave,
heroic American people.

00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:03.030
So yes. You have a question?

00:28:03.030 --> 00:28:08.340
&gt;&gt; So basically the
statue is an immigrant,

00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:13.910
and even though [inaudible]
immigrant too.

00:28:13.910 --> 00:28:15.210
&gt;&gt; Shawn Harris: Yeah.

00:28:15.210 --> 00:28:17.220
She's standing in the harbor
there in New York City

00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:20.150
where the most people
immigrate to the United States,

00:28:20.150 --> 00:28:21.960
and welcoming them
with her torch.

00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:23.960
You have a question?

00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:26.480
&gt;&gt; Yeah. My question
is how many years

00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:29.740
or months did it
take you to do that?

00:28:29.740 --> 00:28:31.040
&gt;&gt; Shawn Harris: How many years?

00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:33.340
It -- You know, it took me --

00:28:33.340 --> 00:28:37.760
I basically didn't sleep
for about six months.

00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:39.060
Yeah. Yeah.

00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:40.670
So maybe that's --
Should I call that a year

00:28:40.670 --> 00:28:41.970
or should I call it six months?

00:28:41.970 --> 00:28:43.270
Do we? Okay.

00:28:43.270 --> 00:28:44.570
Okay. We'll just call
it six months then.

00:28:44.570 --> 00:28:46.760
Yeah. That's hard?

00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:51.660
Well, you -- How --
I slept a little bit.

00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:54.980
You know, like when you
have a big project due?

00:28:54.980 --> 00:29:00.510
And like the whole last night
you stay up and you work

00:29:00.510 --> 00:29:01.810
on the project, and the next day

00:29:01.810 --> 00:29:03.110
at school you're
like falling asleep?

00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:05.280
That's how I was
for like six months.

00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:07.910
Yeah. Because this book wasn't
originally going to come

00:29:07.910 --> 00:29:11.560
out until next year, and
the publisher decided,

00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:13.310
"We want to put this out now."

00:29:13.310 --> 00:29:14.610
As soon as possible.

00:29:14.610 --> 00:29:15.910
So they called me up and said,

00:29:15.910 --> 00:29:17.210
"How fast can you
cut that paper?"

00:29:17.210 --> 00:29:19.830
And I said, "Not much faster."

00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:22.210
And they said, "Well, try."

00:29:22.210 --> 00:29:25.260
And so I called -- I
actually called my mom.

00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:26.770
And my mom lives in Arizona.

00:29:26.770 --> 00:29:28.100
And I said, "Mom."

00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:30.360
My mom taught me how to
cut paper when I was a kid.

00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:31.800
And I said, "Mom,
can you come over

00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:33.390
and help me cut some stuff out?"

00:29:33.390 --> 00:29:34.690
And she did.

00:29:34.690 --> 00:29:36.670
She drove to my house from
Arizona, and she helped me cut

00:29:36.670 --> 00:29:39.750
out the paper that I
used for this book.

00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:41.760
Yes. You have a question.

00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:44.170
&gt;&gt; Does the author choose the
pictures that he wants you

00:29:44.170 --> 00:29:45.990
to draw or do you choose them?

00:29:45.990 --> 00:29:47.300
&gt;&gt; Shawn Harris:
We wok together.

00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:48.780
I work together with the author.

00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:54.610
But most of this book, most of
this book, I chose the pictures.

00:29:54.610 --> 00:29:55.910
I sent them to the author.

00:29:55.910 --> 00:29:57.740
And then he would maybe
have a little idea.

00:29:57.740 --> 00:30:06.700
Like, for instance, on this page
this bird was pink, and he said,

00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:08.600
"Hey, that pink bird,

00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:11.890
I feel like maybe you're
gilding the lilies there."

00:30:11.890 --> 00:30:16.430
And so I looked up that
phrase, and I went, "Okay.

00:30:16.430 --> 00:30:18.410
I think if I just -- I'm
going to turn the bird brown."

00:30:18.410 --> 00:30:19.710
And he said, "Perfect.

00:30:19.710 --> 00:30:21.010
I love it."

00:30:21.010 --> 00:30:24.940
So that's an example of
how we worked together.

00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:26.240
Let's do one more question,

00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:28.320
and then let's do an
art project together.

00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:29.620
You have a question.

00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:31.720
Yes.

00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:36.780
&gt;&gt; How did you -- How did
you know if you had it right?

00:30:36.780 --> 00:30:38.970
How did you --

00:30:38.970 --> 00:30:42.680
&gt;&gt; Shawn Harris: How
did I know if I had --

00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:44.780
if I was like drawing
the right thing?

00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:46.080
Is that what you're
talking about?

00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:47.380
&gt;&gt; And write it.

00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:49.220
&gt;&gt; Shawn Harris: Well, like I
said, my friend wrote the book,

00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:53.910
but both of us made --
Both of us had to do a lot

00:30:53.910 --> 00:30:55.210
of research for the book.

00:30:55.210 --> 00:30:58.960
Remember when I told you that
all the original pictures

00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:01.440
of the Statue of Liberty
were in black and white.

00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:04.430
So I was -- I had to
figure out, "Oh, okay.

00:31:04.430 --> 00:31:08.250
So was she the color of a penny
here or was she green here?"

00:31:08.250 --> 00:31:12.060
And then I sent in my
drawings to the publisher

00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:15.600
that printed the book, and then
they have a whole team whose job

00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:17.080
it is to fact check the book.

00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:19.000
And so they actually came
back to me and they said, "Oh,

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:22.190
you know, in that picture
where she's holding the banana

00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:25.950
in the air, well, your
coffee pot wasn't invented

00:31:25.950 --> 00:31:27.360
for another 20 years.

00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:30.700
You're going to have to put a
different coffee pot in there."

00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:32.780
And so when you make
a factual book,

00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:34.730
you have to get those
things right.

00:31:34.730 --> 00:31:37.560
And luckily I was
working with a good team,

00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:39.330
but with Dave there were a
couple things that he had

00:31:39.330 --> 00:31:41.620
to change in the text as well.

00:31:41.620 --> 00:31:43.720
We got a couple dates
wrong at certain times,

00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:45.570
and we had to figure
out, okay, this is this.

00:31:45.570 --> 00:31:48.860
But yeah. It was
a group project.

00:31:48.860 --> 00:31:51.600
There were people working on
it, and they were looking things

00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:54.090
up in books and going to places
like the Library of Congress

00:31:54.090 --> 00:31:56.290
and making sure we were right.

00:31:56.290 --> 00:31:59.490
So yeah. You have -- I'll let
you continue your question.

00:31:59.490 --> 00:32:01.730
&gt;&gt; How did you know if
you had to put a date?

00:32:01.730 --> 00:32:04.130
How did you know?

00:32:04.130 --> 00:32:07.670
&gt;&gt; Shawn Harris: Well, those
same people would fact check.

00:32:07.670 --> 00:32:09.750
So we would say a date,
and they would go,

00:32:09.750 --> 00:32:12.060
"You just said the wrong date.

00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:13.460
That was 100 years too late."

00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:14.760
And we'd go, "Oh.

00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:16.060
Yeah. Yeah.

00:32:16.060 --> 00:32:17.820
Yeah. That's what I meant."

00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:20.160
Okay. Should we do
some art together?

00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:22.580
When we're done, if you
guys have questions for me

00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:25.000
that you want to come ask
me, I'll be here hanging out.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.300
So you can come.

00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:27.600
If anybody at the end
wants to come and look

00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:30.450
at the original art that
I put down somewhere,

00:32:30.450 --> 00:32:33.030
and wants to come see
that closer or wants

00:32:33.030 --> 00:32:35.540
to come ask me anything,
I'll be here.

00:32:35.540 --> 00:32:36.960
Now you guys have shapes.

00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:38.260
Can I get your shapes?

00:32:38.260 --> 00:32:39.560
Yes. Awesome.

00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:41.500
Okay. Brilliant.

00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:43.800
Brilliant.

00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:47.680
Brilliant.

00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:49.450
You know what?

00:32:49.450 --> 00:32:51.750
I'm actually going to need --

00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:54.850
I'm actually going
to need five helpers.

00:32:54.850 --> 00:32:56.200
Can I get five helpers?

00:32:56.200 --> 00:33:01.220
Okay. Like cat ears
and white shirt.

00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:05.930
And yellow shirt and let's see.

00:33:05.930 --> 00:33:08.490
Oh, I like your bow.

00:33:08.490 --> 00:33:10.020
Come on forward right here.

00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:12.370
And then one more helper.

00:33:12.370 --> 00:33:13.870
You back there in
the green shirt.

00:33:13.870 --> 00:33:16.580
Okay. All right.

00:33:16.580 --> 00:33:19.920
If you guys would help me
collect the paper, and then stay

00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:22.140
up here with me,
that would be great.

00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:28.840
Maybe I can give you this
little stack right here.

00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:32.040
Hi. Would you grab this
stack of paper right -- Oh.

00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:33.340
Those are cool.

00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:34.640
These are great.

00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:38.550
Can you hold these?

00:33:38.550 --> 00:33:42.280
Oh. Well, can you ask me
after we're done here?

00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:43.580
Okay. So yeah.

00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:44.880
Each of you, I want you each

00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:47.510
to grab a little
pile of shapes here.

00:33:47.510 --> 00:33:49.010
Okay? Okay.

00:33:49.010 --> 00:33:50.740
Yeah. Why don't you
grab some of them?

00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:53.250
Why don't you give
her some of them?

00:33:53.250 --> 00:33:55.490
Are there any more
shapes out there?

00:33:55.490 --> 00:33:58.550
Do you have some shapes?

00:33:58.550 --> 00:34:04.870
I want each of you
to hold some shapes.

00:34:04.870 --> 00:34:06.310
Okay? Okay.

00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:08.550
So can -- That's okay.

00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:12.070
You only need four.

00:34:12.070 --> 00:34:15.680
Actually. What's your name?

00:34:16.770 --> 00:34:19.180
Evelyn. And you are?

00:34:19.180 --> 00:34:20.480
McKenzie [assumed spelling].

00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:22.550
I like your name.

00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:24.260
Your name is?

00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:25.980
Landon. Okay.

00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:27.490
McKenzie. Got it.

00:34:27.490 --> 00:34:28.790
What's your name?

00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:30.090
[Inaudible] good to meet you.

00:34:30.090 --> 00:34:31.390
And your name is?

00:34:31.390 --> 00:34:33.770
Amir [assumed spelling]
good to meet you.

00:34:33.770 --> 00:34:35.070
I'm Shawn.

00:34:35.070 --> 00:34:38.390
Okay. Can you give
some shapes to Evelyn?

00:34:38.390 --> 00:34:41.890
Can you give Evelyn maybe
four of your shapes?

00:34:41.890 --> 00:34:44.640
All right.

00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:45.940
You guys each have some shapes.

00:34:45.940 --> 00:34:47.720
Okay. If you guys
would stand up here

00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:50.810
in a line right here,
stand in a line.

00:34:50.810 --> 00:34:56.710
Stand in a line in
front of everybody here.

00:34:56.710 --> 00:34:59.010
In front of everybody.

00:34:59.010 --> 00:35:00.310
Okay. Okay.

00:35:00.310 --> 00:35:01.610
All right.

00:35:01.610 --> 00:35:02.910
So we're going to do
some art together.

00:35:02.910 --> 00:35:04.690
You guys together right now
might have a microphone already.

00:35:04.690 --> 00:35:08.130
Okay. I would like
each of you -- Okay.

00:35:08.130 --> 00:35:09.430
No. The first one of you.

00:35:09.430 --> 00:35:10.730
We're going to go in a row here.

00:35:10.730 --> 00:35:12.030
You're standing next to me.

What's your name?

00:35:13.330 --> 00:35:14.630
&gt;&gt; Dikaya [assumed spelling].

00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:15.930
&gt;&gt; Shawn Harris: Dikaya.

00:35:15.930 --> 00:35:17.230
You guys know Dikaya.

00:35:17.230 --> 00:35:19.160
Okay. Dikaya, if you could
look through your shapes

00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:22.580
and give me your
favorite shape cut out in

00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:24.480
that pile right there.

00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:26.320
Give me your favorite shape.

00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:28.360
We're going to start
with Dikaya's shape here

00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:29.660
that one of you guys cut out.

00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:32.260
And we're going to --
That's a good shape.

00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:33.600
Okay. All right.

00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:39.830
Okay. What could -- What could
we interpret this shape to be?

00:35:39.830 --> 00:35:46.510
You guys can -- You guys
can just shout it out.

00:35:46.510 --> 00:35:49.490
[ Inaudible ]

00:35:49.490 --> 00:35:51.370
Okay. Let's go back
to the hands.

00:35:51.370 --> 00:35:52.670
Let's go back to the hands.

00:35:52.670 --> 00:35:53.970
Let's go back to the hands.

00:35:53.970 --> 00:35:56.270
I thought that was
going to be -- Okay.

00:35:56.270 --> 00:35:57.570
You have an idea.

00:35:57.570 --> 00:35:58.870
&gt;&gt; A leaf because
it has the stem.

00:35:58.870 --> 00:36:00.170
&gt;&gt; Shawn Harris: A leaf.

00:36:00.170 --> 00:36:01.470
Okay. Because it has a stem.

00:36:01.470 --> 00:36:04.590
Now what if I turn
the shape this way?

00:36:04.590 --> 00:36:06.290
What could it be now?

00:36:06.290 --> 00:36:09.400
What could we interpret
this to mean?

00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:13.040
Any ideas, theories, reminders?

00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:15.280
An eye? That's cool.

00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:16.580
That's cool.

00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:18.140
What if I turn it that way?

00:36:18.140 --> 00:36:19.970
Back to a leaf?

00:36:19.970 --> 00:36:22.720
Let's go with the eye.

00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:24.550
I think the eye is a cool idea.

00:36:24.550 --> 00:36:26.510
I think the eye.

00:36:26.510 --> 00:36:29.230
[ Inaudible ]

00:36:29.230 --> 00:36:30.660
She says -- Wait.

00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:31.960
Wait. Wait.

00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:33.260
She says, "I made it.

00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:34.930
It's supposed to be a leaf."

00:36:34.930 --> 00:36:37.770
&gt;&gt; It could also be [inaudible].

00:36:37.770 --> 00:36:39.070
&gt;&gt; Shawn Harris: It could.

00:36:39.070 --> 00:36:40.370
It could be a lot of things,

00:36:40.370 --> 00:36:42.520
but here's the cool
thing about making art.

00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:45.900
And here's the cool thing
about looking at art.

00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:47.200
Hold on, you guys.

00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:50.560
You guys. This is actually my
favorite thing about the book

00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:53.880
that I just read to
you is that the Statue

00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:56.000
of Liberty is a piece of art.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.630
You guys realize this giant
sculpture, that's art.

00:36:58.630 --> 00:36:59.930
An artist made it.

00:36:59.930 --> 00:37:04.120
Right? And this whole book is
the author Dave Eggers looking

00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:07.460
at this piece of art and
saying, "What could this mean?"

00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:12.080
And that is so interesting
to me because she says,

00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:14.610
"This is a leaf because I
cut it out and it's a leaf."

00:37:14.610 --> 00:37:17.280
Well, we can also
interpret it to be an eye.

00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:18.590
So let's use it.

00:37:18.590 --> 00:37:20.000
Can we use it as an eye?

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.710
Is that okay with you?

00:37:22.710 --> 00:37:24.010
Okay. She says okay.

00:37:24.010 --> 00:37:27.160
That's very big of you
to let us repurpose

00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:28.980
and reinterpret your art.

00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:30.710
So I have a glue
stick right here.

00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:33.310
You guys have a glue stick
at your classroom at home?

00:37:33.310 --> 00:37:34.610
Anything? Yeah.

00:37:34.610 --> 00:37:36.240
Yeah. Yeah.

00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:38.440
This is art of the people.

00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:41.010
Okay? You can all
do this at home.

00:37:41.010 --> 00:37:43.820
You don't need any
fancy equipment.

00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:46.710
Well, I might use the stem.

00:37:46.710 --> 00:37:48.010
Watch this.

00:37:48.010 --> 00:37:50.110
Watch this.

00:37:50.110 --> 00:37:53.070
Okay. Still kind of --

00:37:53.070 --> 00:37:55.140
Still kind of looks like
maybe it's a leaf sitting

00:37:55.140 --> 00:37:58.820
on the ground, but
what if I go like.

00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:18.630
What if I go like that?

00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:22.290
What if I go like that?

00:38:22.290 --> 00:38:25.550
Suddenly it doesn't look
like a leaf anymore.

00:38:25.550 --> 00:38:27.020
Right? Okay.

00:38:27.020 --> 00:38:31.210
Now thank you, Dikaya,
for that shape.

00:38:31.210 --> 00:38:32.510
Landon, right?

00:38:32.510 --> 00:38:33.810
Is it Landon?

00:38:33.810 --> 00:38:36.710
Landon, what shape are we going
to use that you have selected?

00:38:36.710 --> 00:38:38.980
&gt;&gt; We could use this heart.

00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:40.280
&gt;&gt; Shawn Harris: Okay.

00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:44.450
So Landon says -- Landon
says we can use this heart.

00:38:44.450 --> 00:38:48.160
But what besides a heart
could we turn this in to?

00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:49.460
Any ideas?

00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:52.150
Yes. You in the yellow shirt.

00:38:54.940 --> 00:38:56.380
&gt;&gt; Shawn Harris:
Fire for a torch.

00:38:56.380 --> 00:38:57.990
That would be a really
good fire.

00:38:57.990 --> 00:39:00.840
What about if we
turn it that way?

00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:02.700
Any ideas there?

00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:04.000
You have an idea.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:05.310
&gt;&gt; It could be a butt.

00:39:05.310 --> 00:39:07.640
&gt;&gt; Shawn Harris: It.

00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:08.940
Everybody has one.

00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:10.240
It could be a butt.

00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:14.340
What if -- What if
we turn it this way?

00:39:14.340 --> 00:39:15.640
What do you think?

00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:17.940
&gt;&gt; It can be lips.

00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:21.010
&gt;&gt; Shawn Harris:
It could be lips?

00:39:21.010 --> 00:39:22.310
Definitely.

00:39:22.310 --> 00:39:23.610
Oh. That would be cool.

00:39:23.610 --> 00:39:24.910
Let's do that.

00:39:24.910 --> 00:39:26.210
Let's do that.

00:39:26.210 --> 00:39:27.510
This could be really
interesting.

00:39:27.510 --> 00:39:29.200
This could be really
interesting.

00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:30.500
All right.

00:39:30.500 --> 00:39:33.250
We are going to turn
this in to big lips.

00:39:33.250 --> 00:39:34.550
Cool. Cool.

00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:36.370
Cool. Let's do it.

00:39:36.370 --> 00:39:45.830
So I'm going to put a little bit
of glue on our page right here.

00:40:13.170 --> 00:40:15.100
You want to take it off?

00:40:15.100 --> 00:40:16.800
You can take it off.

00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:18.100
You don't want it?

00:40:18.100 --> 00:40:19.400
Yeah. Come help me.

00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:20.700
You can just pull it off.

00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:22.000
Go for it.

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:23.300
There you go.

00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:25.800
Okay. All right.

00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:27.700
And remind me your name.

00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:31.050
McKenzie. McKenzie just said
you should take that little,

00:40:31.050 --> 00:40:32.540
the hair on the bottom
of her lip, off.

00:40:32.540 --> 00:40:33.840
And so I let her do that.

00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:35.470
That was her decision.

00:40:35.470 --> 00:40:37.940
Okay. McKenzie, you
have a shape for us?

00:40:37.940 --> 00:40:41.190
Oh. McKenzie, that's cool.

00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:42.490
That's a cool shape.

00:40:42.490 --> 00:40:45.380
You got some crazy
scissors, huh?

00:40:45.380 --> 00:40:48.860
What could we interpret
McKenzie's shape as?

00:40:48.860 --> 00:40:50.160
What could that be, everybody?

00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:51.460
What could that be?

00:40:51.460 --> 00:40:52.760
You have an idea?

00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:54.060
&gt;&gt; A person.

00:40:54.060 --> 00:40:55.360
&gt;&gt; Shawn Harris: It
could be a person.

00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:56.660
What do you see?

00:40:56.660 --> 00:40:57.960
What part of a person
do you see?

00:40:57.960 --> 00:41:00.010
You see some arms and legs?

00:41:00.010 --> 00:41:02.220
Okay. What if I turn
it this way?

00:41:02.220 --> 00:41:05.310
What could that be?

00:41:05.310 --> 00:41:06.940
Could be a bunny for sure.

00:41:06.940 --> 00:41:10.210
For sure. Wait.

00:41:10.210 --> 00:41:11.510
You have an idea.

00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:12.810
&gt;&gt; Crab.

00:41:12.810 --> 00:41:14.980
&gt;&gt; Shawn Harris: It
could be a crab for sure.

00:41:14.980 --> 00:41:17.580
For sure. You have an
idea in the yellow shirt.

00:41:17.580 --> 00:41:18.880
&gt;&gt; It could be a dress.

00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:20.230
&gt;&gt; Shawn Harris: It
could be a dress?

00:41:20.230 --> 00:41:21.530
That would be cool.

00:41:21.530 --> 00:41:23.210
That would be -- I
feel like there's sort

00:41:23.210 --> 00:41:26.010
of a story taking shape here.

00:41:26.010 --> 00:41:27.310
It could be hair.

00:41:27.310 --> 00:41:31.050
Oh. He said it could be hair.

00:41:31.050 --> 00:41:32.550
I think this could be really --

00:41:32.550 --> 00:41:34.650
This could be really
good hair, I think.

00:41:34.650 --> 00:41:35.950
Let's see.

00:41:35.950 --> 00:41:38.740
What if we just kind
of put it right there?

00:41:38.740 --> 00:41:43.550
Does that look like
hair to you guys?

00:41:43.550 --> 00:41:44.850
&gt;&gt; No.

00:41:44.850 --> 00:41:46.720
&gt;&gt; Shawn Harris: What if
we -- It could be a bow.

00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:48.150
That would be a good -- Yeah.

00:41:48.150 --> 00:41:49.450
Let's make it a bow.

00:41:49.450 --> 00:41:50.750
That's a good idea.

00:41:50.750 --> 00:41:53.540
Okay. So first before we do --

00:41:53.540 --> 00:41:57.760
Before we put the bow on our
character's head right here,

00:41:57.760 --> 00:42:00.810
I'm going to give it some hair.

00:42:00.810 --> 00:42:03.960
Okay? Okay?

00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:08.160
That way. Otherwise what do
you tie the bow to, right?

00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:10.300
Okay. All right.

00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:14.130
All right.

00:42:14.130 --> 00:42:18.270
Oh. That's cool.

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:23.560
Okay. Which way do we want
to put our bow right here?

00:42:23.560 --> 00:42:24.860
Like that?

00:42:24.860 --> 00:42:26.300
Yeah. That's cool.

00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:31.090
Oh. That's really nice.

00:42:31.090 --> 00:42:33.390
That's really nice.

00:42:39.700 --> 00:42:41.000
That's nice.

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:42.300
I like that.

00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:43.690
Okay. We have a couple more.

00:42:43.690 --> 00:42:44.990
We have a couple more people.

00:42:44.990 --> 00:42:46.290
Oh. That's cool.

00:42:46.290 --> 00:42:47.590
That's cool.

00:42:47.590 --> 00:42:48.890
Wait. Hold on.

00:42:48.890 --> 00:42:50.430
Wait. And your name was?

00:42:50.430 --> 00:42:53.500
Evelyn. Okay.

00:42:53.500 --> 00:42:58.600
You guys. Thank you.

00:42:58.600 --> 00:43:01.050
So Evelyn just picked
out a shape.

00:43:01.050 --> 00:43:02.350
We're going to use
this shape next.

00:43:02.350 --> 00:43:05.220
We have a lot of red
shapes which I like.

00:43:05.220 --> 00:43:06.590
We're going kind
of monochromatic

00:43:06.590 --> 00:43:08.280
which really makes
the eyes stand out.

00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:11.060
Right? When we're using
all red and black,

00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:13.610
and then we've just got
this one different color,

00:43:13.610 --> 00:43:15.100
it really makes me
focus on that.

00:43:15.100 --> 00:43:16.400
I like that.

00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:17.700
I think this is cool.

00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:19.210
What can we use this shape as?

00:43:19.210 --> 00:43:21.130
Yes. Yellow shirt.

00:43:21.130 --> 00:43:26.920
&gt;&gt; We could use it as
something like a car.

00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:28.220
&gt;&gt; Shawn Harris:
Something like a car.

00:43:28.220 --> 00:43:31.250
Oh. She could be parking a car.

00:43:31.250 --> 00:43:32.550
She would be getting in a car.

00:43:32.550 --> 00:43:33.850
She'd be like calling a car.

00:43:33.850 --> 00:43:35.300
You have an idea?

00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:36.600
Yeah.

00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:37.900
&gt;&gt; A neck.

00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:39.200
&gt;&gt; Shawn Harris: A neck.

00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:40.500
This could be a cool neck.

00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:41.800
Definitely could be a good neck.

00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:43.100
You have an idea?

00:43:43.100 --> 00:43:45.730
&gt;&gt; It can be -- It could be --

00:43:45.730 --> 00:43:47.030
&gt;&gt; Shawn Harris: If
I turn it this way,

00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:50.830
does it give you
a different idea?

00:43:50.830 --> 00:43:52.130
What about that way?

00:43:52.130 --> 00:43:54.030
&gt;&gt; It can be their
shoulders probably.

00:43:54.030 --> 00:43:56.010
&gt;&gt; Shawn Harris: It could
definitely be a shoulder.

00:43:56.010 --> 00:43:57.310
Maybe like a shoulder pad.

00:43:57.310 --> 00:43:58.610
Like those are good.

00:43:58.610 --> 00:44:00.910
Oh. I haven't heard
from you yet.

00:44:00.910 --> 00:44:02.330
&gt;&gt; A pocket.

00:44:02.330 --> 00:44:03.630
&gt;&gt; Shawn Harris:
Could be a pocket.

00:44:03.630 --> 00:44:06.460
Oh. That's -- I like that.

00:44:06.460 --> 00:44:09.420
And what -- And maybe we could
put something in her pocket.

00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:11.800
Right? Would that
be interesting?

00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:15.970
Okay. Oh. Cool.

00:44:15.970 --> 00:44:17.270
That's a good one.

00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:20.050
Okay. So we're going to turn
this in to a pocket right here.

00:44:20.050 --> 00:44:29.000
But what makes a -- We need some
context here, I think, because,

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:31.040
you know, what makes
a pocket a pocket?

00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:37.380
Right? Maybe if she
has a shirt on.

00:44:37.380 --> 00:44:40.970
Maybe if she has a shirt
kind of like your shirt.

00:44:40.970 --> 00:44:42.360
Oh, you don't have a pocket.

00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:43.660
Who has a pocket on their shirt?

00:44:43.660 --> 00:44:46.090
You have a pocket on your -- Oh.

00:44:46.090 --> 00:44:47.390
Look at it.

00:44:47.390 --> 00:44:48.990
McKenzie, right?

00:44:48.990 --> 00:44:50.580
Look at McKenzie's
pocket right here.

00:44:50.580 --> 00:44:51.970
Let's do a pocket like that.

00:44:51.970 --> 00:44:53.270
Let's do a pocket like that.

00:44:53.270 --> 00:44:55.140
So I'm going to do a shirt
kind of like McKenzie's.

00:44:55.140 --> 00:45:00.190
So if I give her -- If I give
her shirt a neck right there,

00:45:00.190 --> 00:45:07.160
and maybe an arm,
and another arm.

00:45:16.580 --> 00:45:19.030
And then McKenzie has all
these stripes on her shirt

00:45:19.030 --> 00:45:21.590
so I'm going to draw
these stripes.

00:45:21.590 --> 00:45:22.890
You see when I just looked

00:45:22.890 --> 00:45:24.540
at McKenzie's shirt,
and then I drew it?

00:45:24.540 --> 00:45:27.030
That's called research
right there.

00:45:27.030 --> 00:45:34.020
That's what that's called.

00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:35.320
All right.

00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:36.620
Cool. Okay.

00:45:36.620 --> 00:45:37.920
So we are almost done.

00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:40.900
I'm -- She needs
something more of a head,

00:45:40.900 --> 00:45:43.430
and maybe she needs
to hold something.

00:45:43.430 --> 00:45:46.650
Do we have any more volunteers
up here that have shapes?

00:45:46.650 --> 00:45:47.950
You didn't go yet.

00:45:47.950 --> 00:45:49.250
What -- And your name was?

00:45:49.250 --> 00:45:50.550
&gt;&gt; Amir.

00:45:50.550 --> 00:45:51.850
&gt;&gt; Shawn Harris: Amir
has a shape for us.

00:45:51.850 --> 00:45:53.150
Amir, what's it going to be?

00:45:53.150 --> 00:45:55.580
This could change
everything, Amir.

00:46:01.380 --> 00:46:02.680
No. No. No.

00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:03.980
Let him choose.

00:46:03.980 --> 00:46:05.280
Let him choose, McKenzie.

00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:06.580
We already drew your shirt.

00:46:06.580 --> 00:46:08.360
What's it going to be?

00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:10.520
Do you want to ask them
what shape we should use?

00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:12.250
Hold up your two favorites.

00:46:12.250 --> 00:46:15.400
Hold up your two favorites.

00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:16.750
All right.

00:46:16.750 --> 00:46:18.870
Amir has his two favorites.

00:46:18.870 --> 00:46:21.400
Hold up your left hand, Amir.

00:46:21.400 --> 00:46:25.990
Or. Which one did you guys want?

00:46:25.990 --> 00:46:27.290
Point to the side.

00:46:27.290 --> 00:46:30.560
Point to the side.

00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:31.860
This one? Okay.

00:46:31.860 --> 00:46:33.160
All right.

00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:34.460
We're doing this one.

00:46:34.460 --> 00:46:35.760
Good job, Amir.

00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:37.350
That was very democratic.

00:46:37.350 --> 00:46:38.650
What's that?

00:46:38.650 --> 00:46:39.950
Thank you.

00:46:39.950 --> 00:46:41.250
What could this be?

00:46:41.250 --> 00:46:43.360
It could be like a skirt.

00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:44.660
It could be a mask.

00:46:44.660 --> 00:46:47.620
Oh. That would be interesting.

00:46:47.620 --> 00:46:51.740
Oh. Who has -- Who
has our scissors?

00:46:51.740 --> 00:46:53.940
Who has scissors on them?

00:46:53.940 --> 00:46:56.350
So you know what?

00:46:56.350 --> 00:46:58.590
I'm just going to -- I'm
going go ahead and rip it,

00:46:58.590 --> 00:47:02.750
if that's okay with you guys.

00:47:12.450 --> 00:47:17.030
You guys. She's at
a masquerade ball.

00:47:17.030 --> 00:47:18.330
Is that what somebody said?

00:47:18.330 --> 00:47:20.620
That's cool.

00:47:20.620 --> 00:47:24.320
She's a superhero?

00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:26.000
There are so many
interpretations

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:27.300
that we can make.

00:47:27.300 --> 00:47:28.770
Right? Look at this.

00:47:28.770 --> 00:47:34.150
So now -- Now we
need another eye.

00:47:34.150 --> 00:47:36.730
Here's the crazy thing.

00:47:36.730 --> 00:47:43.800
We now know something about
her that nobody else knows.

00:47:44.930 --> 00:47:48.510
Right? Wow.

00:47:48.510 --> 00:47:51.260
I'm going to give her
a little nose in here.

00:47:51.260 --> 00:47:52.640
All right.

00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:53.980
Okay. Okay.

00:47:53.980 --> 00:47:55.710
Let's do one more shape.

00:47:55.710 --> 00:47:58.840
I want to put something
in her hand right here.

00:47:58.840 --> 00:48:01.160
I want to put something
in her hand.

00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:02.590
Let's see what it's going to be.

00:48:02.590 --> 00:48:07.540
Okay? Let's see the blue thing.

00:48:07.540 --> 00:48:08.840
Let's see the blue thing.

00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:10.140
All right.

00:48:10.140 --> 00:48:11.440
Another point of interest.

00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:12.740
Amir had another one.

00:48:12.740 --> 00:48:14.040
What could this be in her hand?

00:48:14.040 --> 00:48:16.300
Okay. Hold on.

00:48:16.300 --> 00:48:21.570
Let's take hands.

00:48:21.570 --> 00:48:24.940
You have an idea.

00:48:24.940 --> 00:48:26.240
&gt;&gt; A ball.

00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:27.540
&gt;&gt; Shawn Harris:
It could be a ball?

00:48:27.540 --> 00:48:28.840
What kind of ball?

00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:32.740
What kind of ball?

00:48:32.740 --> 00:48:34.610
It could definitely be a torch.

00:48:34.610 --> 00:48:36.720
That would be a really
good tie in to the book

00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:38.340
if we put a torch in her hand.

00:48:38.340 --> 00:48:40.250
Should we put a -- Let's
put a torch in her hand.

00:48:40.250 --> 00:48:43.950
I was going to make it a
ball, but let's do a torch.

00:48:43.950 --> 00:48:45.430
A jawbreaker.

00:48:45.430 --> 00:48:47.420
That would be the right
size for her mouth.

00:48:47.420 --> 00:48:53.540
Right? All right, you guys,

00:48:53.540 --> 00:48:55.850
we're going to make
this a torch right here.

00:48:55.850 --> 00:48:57.150
We're going to make
this a torch.

00:48:57.150 --> 00:49:00.910
That's going to be a torch.

00:49:00.910 --> 00:49:04.050
And this is the crazy thing.

00:49:04.050 --> 00:49:10.150
Yeah. That can be the stick.

00:49:10.150 --> 00:49:11.450
That's great.

00:49:11.450 --> 00:49:13.210
That's great.

00:49:13.210 --> 00:49:15.510
I love it.

00:49:19.670 --> 00:49:20.780
I love it.

00:49:20.780 --> 00:49:24.480
Okay. Who's got a
piece of yellow?

00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:26.320
Yeah. Who's got a yellow piece?

00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:27.620
That will work.

00:49:27.620 --> 00:49:28.920
That's great.

00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:30.680
Give me that heart
too, would you?

00:49:30.680 --> 00:49:35.040
Give me that orange heart
on the ground there.

00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:44.460
All right.

00:49:44.460 --> 00:49:48.250
You guys, while I -- You guys,
while I finish this torch,

00:49:48.250 --> 00:49:50.190
can you guys do a slow clap?

00:49:50.190 --> 00:49:51.490
Very slow.

00:49:51.490 --> 00:49:56.290
And then I'll be done
by the time we get fast.

00:49:56.290 --> 00:49:58.170
Okay. All right.

00:49:58.170 --> 00:49:59.470
All right.

00:49:59.470 --> 00:50:04.510
I'm going to be done by the time
we're -- You're fast clapping.

00:50:04.510 --> 00:50:07.040
[ Clapping ]

00:50:07.040 --> 00:50:08.500
All right.

00:50:08.500 --> 00:50:11.830
There it is.

00:50:11.830 --> 00:50:13.130
There it is.

00:50:13.130 --> 00:50:15.530
Okay. Okay.

00:50:15.530 --> 00:50:17.740
One last thing that
I want to do.

00:50:17.740 --> 00:50:21.110
With my volunteers that were
up here, Amir and McKenzie

00:50:21.110 --> 00:50:28.840
and Dikaya and Landon,
Evelyn, would you come up here,

00:50:28.840 --> 00:50:30.150
Evelyn, for one last thing?

00:50:30.150 --> 00:50:31.690
Would you guys face
the audience?

00:50:31.690 --> 00:50:33.690
And stand in a line for me.

00:50:33.690 --> 00:50:36.440
Amir, you're going to
be last right here.

00:50:36.440 --> 00:50:38.620
Landon, you're going to
be first right there.

00:50:38.620 --> 00:50:39.920
Yeah. Right there.

00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:46.100
Okay. Now what I want to do
is have you guys tell a story

00:50:46.100 --> 00:50:48.770
about this picture that
we all just made together.

00:50:48.770 --> 00:50:51.140
Okay? So we're going
to start here.

00:50:51.140 --> 00:50:55.220
We're going to start,
"Once upon a time."

00:50:55.220 --> 00:51:02.000
&gt;&gt; Once upon a time there
was a statue that was --

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:07.300
that had a mask on with
a torch hanging on it.

00:51:07.300 --> 00:51:09.600
&gt;&gt; Shawn Harris: And then.

00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:11.930
&gt;&gt; And then.

00:51:11.930 --> 00:51:13.230
&gt;&gt; Shawn Harris: You
can look at the picture.

00:51:13.230 --> 00:51:15.160
You can look at the
picture for inspiration.

00:51:15.160 --> 00:51:16.460
Right here.

00:51:16.460 --> 00:51:17.760
All right.

00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:19.060
We'll come back to you.

00:51:19.060 --> 00:51:20.590
We'll come back to you.

00:51:20.590 --> 00:51:22.470
You have an idea of where
to go with the story?

00:51:22.470 --> 00:51:23.770
There was a.

00:51:23.770 --> 00:51:27.880
&gt;&gt; And then a fish kissed
her, and then the --

00:51:27.880 --> 00:51:29.180
&gt;&gt; Shawn Harris:
A fish kissed her?

00:51:29.180 --> 00:51:32.330
&gt;&gt; And then the lips
got stuck on her face.

00:51:32.330 --> 00:51:34.530
&gt;&gt; Shawn Harris: The fish
lips got stuck on her face?

00:51:34.530 --> 00:51:38.260
&gt;&gt; And finally she
finally got a shirt,

00:51:38.260 --> 00:51:44.370
and they had stripes on her.

00:51:44.370 --> 00:51:47.280
And she -- And her name was.

00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:48.730
&gt;&gt; Shawn Harris: Her name was?

00:51:48.730 --> 00:51:50.030
&gt;&gt; Lady Liberty.

00:51:50.030 --> 00:51:51.460
&gt;&gt; Shawn Harris: Lady
Liberty, everybody.

00:51:51.460 --> 00:51:55.360
Thank you to my storytellers.

00:51:55.360 --> 00:51:58.970
That was a very inventive story.

00:51:58.970 --> 00:52:00.360
What's that?

00:52:00.360 --> 00:52:01.660
You can bow.

00:52:01.660 --> 00:52:02.960
All of my helpers can bow.

00:52:02.960 --> 00:52:04.260
Everybody bow.

00:52:04.260 --> 00:52:05.600
On three. One.

00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:06.930
Two. Three.

00:52:06.930 --> 00:52:12.120
Bow. Thank you guys very much.

00:52:12.120 --> 00:52:14.810
Thank you for reading
this book with me.

00:52:14.810 --> 00:52:18.300
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
