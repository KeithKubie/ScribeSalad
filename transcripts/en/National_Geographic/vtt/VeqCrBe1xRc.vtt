00:00:00.633 --> 00:00:03.033
[music playing]

00:00:03.033 --> 00:00:04.133
BILLIE MINTZ: I
came here to meet

00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:06.000
an extraordinary
man whose vision

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.433
stretches far beyond himself.

00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:11.734
This is Isaac Nabawana.

00:00:11.734 --> 00:00:12.533
OK.

00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:13.533
Action.

00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:14.900
Action.
Action.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.900
BILLIE MINTZ: He's committed
to changing the country's image

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.800
by making incredibly
violent action

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.000
films that are intended to
knock you dead with laughter.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.400
He's a self-taught filmmaker
and Uganda's most prolific,

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.200
having made over
50 feature films.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.834
And he's turned a few square
blocks of his neighborhood

00:00:32.834 --> 00:00:37.333
into a fully functional
studio back lot.

00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:38.133
This is impossible.

00:00:38.133 --> 00:00:39.700
This should not exist.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.400
I mean, you see, like
there's no plumbing.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.500
Electricity was good
for a while but now it's

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.400
still four days a week maybe.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.066
And making movies.
[beep] it's not possible.

00:00:48.066 --> 00:00:48.767
OK, action.

00:00:53.066 --> 00:00:55.033
BILLIE MINTZ: Alan
Hofmanis is a super fan

00:00:55.033 --> 00:00:58.166
who saw one of Isaac's films
in a Brooklyn bar one night

00:00:58.166 --> 00:01:00.600
and immediately got
on a plane to Uganda

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.266
to meet the genius behind it.

00:01:02.266 --> 00:01:06.533
He never left, eventually
becoming Isaac's co-producer.

00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:08.400
I think people are
coming for the same reason

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.800
that I'm saying.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.934
This reminds people of why they
love movies in the first place.

00:01:13.934 --> 00:01:16.567
Like I'm not an actor, but
you're here for 5 minutes

00:01:16.567 --> 00:01:18.033
and you want to do it.

00:01:18.033 --> 00:01:18.967
You want to be a commando.

00:01:18.967 --> 00:01:19.667
You want to play.

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.066
BILLIE MINTZ: The most obvious
theme in all of Isaac's movies

00:01:28.066 --> 00:01:31.667
is brutal violence taken
to comedic extremes.

00:01:31.667 --> 00:01:35.133
[cheering]

00:01:35.133 --> 00:01:37.633
And that's exactly
the point, violence

00:01:37.633 --> 00:01:40.066
as an artistic expression,
Isaac believes,

00:01:40.066 --> 00:01:42.533
is not only his creative
passion but also

00:01:42.533 --> 00:01:43.934
his country's salvation.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.433
You want to clear the picture
of Ugandans killing people

00:02:01.433 --> 00:02:04.200
by making films of
Ugandans killing people?

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.567
BILLIE MINTZ: Isaac's
over-the-top filmmaking style

00:02:10.567 --> 00:02:13.633
strikes a chord here, driving
modest movie ticket and DVD

00:02:13.633 --> 00:02:17.266
sales, which the actors are
also able to sell door to door,

00:02:17.266 --> 00:02:19.967
thereby supporting the
crew and their families.

00:02:19.967 --> 00:02:22.300
And Isaac isn't just
a local celebrity,

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.867
he's an international
phenomenon with millions

00:02:24.867 --> 00:02:28.500
of hits on YouTube to confirm
his intensely devoted fan base.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.600
[singing]

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.333
BILLIE MINTZ: Even more
devoted are the people

00:02:39.333 --> 00:02:41.533
who come from all
over Uganda to help

00:02:41.533 --> 00:02:46.266
create his micro low
budget full length films.

00:02:46.266 --> 00:02:50.266
[applause]

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.500
Wow, guys, this
is so impressive.

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.633
Any filmmaker in the world, no
matter how successful they are,

00:02:58.633 --> 00:03:01.667
would dream to have
a team like you guys.

00:03:01.667 --> 00:03:05.200
[applause]
