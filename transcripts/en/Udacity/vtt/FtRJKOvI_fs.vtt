00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:01.510
&gt;&gt; Alright, let's do a little quiz.

00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:01.966
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:01.966 --> 00:00:04.140
&gt;&gt; To help us to kind of, make sense of the

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.466
equations in the Q learning equation by looking at a simpler case.

00:00:07.466 --> 00:00:11.090
So let's imagine that we got some variable V and some

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.680
sequencing value X and a sequence of learning rates, alpha sub t.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.602
So we're going to draw a series of these X values and

00:00:17.602 --> 00:00:20.830
use them to update the V values and the learning rate is

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:23.340
changing over time and the learning rate is going to have,

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.260
first of all X is going to be drawn X sub T. Is

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.960
going to be drawn from some, the distribution of some random variable, big X.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:30.801
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:30.801 --> 00:00:31.830
&gt;&gt; And the learning rates are going to

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.730
satisfy two properties. One is that the

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.290
sum of the learning rates, summed up to infinity. But, the sum of the squares

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.480
of the learning rate, as we go to infinity, sums up to something less than

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.360
infinity. So can, can you think of

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.550
a learning rate sequence that has that property?

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.950
&gt;&gt; So, the one that I remember is alpha sub t equals one over t.

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.540
&gt;&gt; Good. So in

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.280
fact these's a whole range of possible powers

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.910
of t that work here, but one over t

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.920
is a good one. Why is this, why does it satisfy the properties? Well, if you sum

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.050
up the values up to sum value t, sum up the one over i values, it actually

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.360
acts like the natural logarithm. And so, as

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.200
t goes to infinity, the sum goes to infinity.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.910
&gt;&gt; But logarithmically.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.470
&gt;&gt; Which is still you know, infinity.

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.120
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.750
&gt;&gt; But if you look at the sums of the squares,

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.020
that's actually a well known problem called the I think,

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.370
the Basil problem, the Basil problem? And it turns out

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.550
to actually be pie squared over six which is kind of

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:27.770
crazy. But there it is which is a finite value.

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.955
&gt;&gt; That's intuitively obvious even to the most casual observer.

00:01:30.955 --> 00:01:34.240
&gt;&gt; No I really, this, it's, it's, it's whacky. It was

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.880
an open problem for a long time and then it was

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.201
finally solved. And it's like, yeah sure pi squared over six.

00:01:38.201 --> 00:01:39.980
Like where's the pi in here? There's no pi in here.

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:41.900
&gt;&gt; Mm, I didn't find pi anywhere.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.640
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's neither here nor there. The whole, the point

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.790
is there's, there's a bunch of sequences of learning rates that satisfy

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.230
this property, and we're going to imagine that we have a sequence

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:53.725
of learning rates that satisfies this property. We're going to be updating V

00:01:53.725 --> 00:01:57.390
sub-t, with a series of X values drawn from, from distribution

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.660
big X, and what I'm asking is, what do you think this

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.390
converges to? Do you think it converges to the expected value

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.960
of X? Do you think maybe it just doesn't converge at all?

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.270
Do you think it converges to the variance of

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.190
X? Of, of the random variable X? Or does it

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.170
converge to infinity, it just keeps growing without bound?

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.100
All right. Does that seem like a well formed question?

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.320
&gt;&gt; sure.

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.120
&gt;&gt; All right. So let's give you a chance to think about it.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.620
&gt;&gt; Okay.
