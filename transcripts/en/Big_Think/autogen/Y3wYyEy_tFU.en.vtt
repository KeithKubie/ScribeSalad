for me the starting on this journey on

00:00:11.529 --> 00:00:11.539
for me the starting on this journey on
 

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:13.089
for me the starting on this journey on
irrational behavior started from

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:13.099
irrational behavior started from
 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:16.179
irrational behavior started from
actually being in a hospital so quite a

00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:16.189
actually being in a hospital so quite a
 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:18.010
actually being in a hospital so quite a
few years ago I got injured in an

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:18.020
few years ago I got injured in an
 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.800
few years ago I got injured in an
explosion I got burned in about seventy

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:20.810
explosion I got burned in about seventy
 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.260
explosion I got burned in about seventy
percent of my body and as a consequence

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:23.270
percent of my body and as a consequence
 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:25.170
percent of my body and as a consequence
i spent about three years in hospital

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:25.180
i spent about three years in hospital
 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.909
i spent about three years in hospital
the first few months in the in the burn

00:00:27.909 --> 00:00:27.919
the first few months in the in the burn
 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:30.389
the first few months in the in the burn
department were particularly painful and

00:00:30.389 --> 00:00:30.399
department were particularly painful and
 

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:32.860
department were particularly painful and
one of the particularly difficult things

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:32.870
one of the particularly difficult things
 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.160
one of the particularly difficult things
was what's called the bath treatment so

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:35.170
was what's called the bath treatment so
 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.959
was what's called the bath treatment so
everybody had a bandaid on and you take

00:00:37.959 --> 00:00:37.969
everybody had a bandaid on and you take
 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:39.400
everybody had a bandaid on and you take
it off and it's always a little bit

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410
it off and it's always a little bit
 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.560
it off and it's always a little bit
painful imagine that there is no skin

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:41.570
painful imagine that there is no skin
 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.200
painful imagine that there is no skin
whatsoever and it's not a small band aid

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210
whatsoever and it's not a small band aid
 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:45.639
whatsoever and it's not a small band aid
but it covers seventy percent of your

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:45.649
but it covers seventy percent of your
 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:48.099
but it covers seventy percent of your
body that's a long process and

00:00:48.099 --> 00:00:48.109
body that's a long process and
 

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:50.919
body that's a long process and
incredibly painful so during the

00:00:50.919 --> 00:00:50.929
incredibly painful so during the
 

00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:53.410
incredibly painful so during the
procedure the nurses would would put me

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420
procedure the nurses would would put me
 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.090
procedure the nurses would would put me
on a stretcher and would lower me into a

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100
on a stretcher and would lower me into a
 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.149
on a stretcher and would lower me into a
bath full of iodine water that would

00:00:58.149 --> 00:00:58.159
bath full of iodine water that would
 

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:00.489
bath full of iodine water that would
stink to start with and then they would

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:00.499
stink to start with and then they would
 

00:01:00.499 --> 00:01:03.459
stink to start with and then they would
go ahead and rip the bandages off one by

00:01:03.459 --> 00:01:03.469
go ahead and rip the bandages off one by
 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:06.250
go ahead and rip the bandages off one by
one for about an hour and and during

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.260
one for about an hour and and during
 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.200
one for about an hour and and during
that process I would have debates over

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210
that process I would have debates over
 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.149
that process I would have debates over
over weeks about what is the best way to

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:13.159
over weeks about what is the best way to
 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:16.360
over weeks about what is the best way to
do it here I was experiencing this

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:16.370
do it here I was experiencing this
 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:18.580
do it here I was experiencing this
incredible pain and what I wanted to do

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590
incredible pain and what I wanted to do
 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.770
incredible pain and what I wanted to do
was to minimize it so I would have

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780
was to minimize it so I would have
 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.630
was to minimize it so I would have
arguments with them about what's the

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640
arguments with them about what's the
 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.790
arguments with them about what's the
right way to trade off the intensity at

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:24.800
right way to trade off the intensity at
 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.460
right way to trade off the intensity at
each moment in the duration so think

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470
each moment in the duration so think
 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:28.870
each moment in the duration so think
about it should you have a shorter

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880
about it should you have a shorter
 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.110
about it should you have a shorter
experience with a high momentary

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:32.120
experience with a high momentary
 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.930
experience with a high momentary
intensity or should you have a lower

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:34.940
intensity or should you have a lower
 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.850
intensity or should you have a lower
momentary tensity carrying the bandages

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860
momentary tensity carrying the bandages
 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.030
momentary tensity carrying the bandages
slower but having longer duration should

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040
slower but having longer duration should
 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.800
slower but having longer duration should
you start from the least painful and

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810
you start from the least painful and
 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.270
you start from the least painful and
move to the most painful or do the

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280
move to the most painful or do the
 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.250
move to the most painful or do the
opposite does it matter should you give

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:45.260
opposite does it matter should you give
 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.320
opposite does it matter should you give
people breaks and not or not breaks and

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330
people breaks and not or not breaks and
 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.600
people breaks and not or not breaks and
I had my own intuitions about what's the

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610
I had my own intuitions about what's the
 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.660
I had my own intuitions about what's the
best way to give me the least pain and

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670
best way to give me the least pain and
 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.030
best way to give me the least pain and
the nurses had a different intuition but

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040
the nurses had a different intuition but
 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.740
the nurses had a different intuition but
given the fact that I was a patient and

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750
given the fact that I was a patient and
 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.560
given the fact that I was a patient and
there were the nurses they were deciding

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.570
there were the nurses they were deciding
 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.690
there were the nurses they were deciding
what to do and when I got out of the

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700
what to do and when I got out of the
 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.250
what to do and when I got out of the
hospital and I learned a little bit

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:03.260
hospital and I learned a little bit
 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.440
hospital and I learned a little bit
about the experimental method I decided

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450
about the experimental method I decided
 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.660
about the experimental method I decided
to test what's the right way so I

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670
to test what's the right way so I
 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.910
to test what's the right way so I
created lab experiments in which i will

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920
created lab experiments in which i will
 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.229
created lab experiments in which i will
bring people in and i would hurt them

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:11.239
bring people in and i would hurt them
 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:13.390
bring people in and i would hurt them
for longer durations and lower

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400
for longer durations and lower
 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.630
for longer durations and lower
intensities at higher intensities

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640
intensities at higher intensities
 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.680
intensities at higher intensities
decreasing increasing with breaks

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690
decreasing increasing with breaks
 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.930
decreasing increasing with breaks
without breaks and after each experience

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940
without breaks and after each experience
 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.730
without breaks and after each experience
i would ask people how painful was this

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740
i would ask people how painful was this
 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:22.720
i would ask people how painful was this
so which

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730
so which
 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.070
so which
one of these two panes would you prefer

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080
one of these two panes would you prefer
 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.559
one of these two panes would you prefer
to repeat again and so now we try to

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569
to repeat again and so now we try to
 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:29.289
to repeat again and so now we try to
infer how people actually aggregate his

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:29.299
infer how people actually aggregate his
 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:31.210
infer how people actually aggregate his
pain if you have an experience at last

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220
pain if you have an experience at last
 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.300
pain if you have an experience at last
over time the change in intensity at the

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310
over time the change in intensity at the
 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:35.770
over time the change in intensity at the
end of it how do you think about the

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780
end of it how do you think about the
 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.559
end of it how do you think about the
whole experience and and to my surprise

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:38.569
whole experience and and to my surprise
 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:41.440
whole experience and and to my surprise
the nurses were wrong what does it mean

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450
the nurses were wrong what does it mean
 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.100
the nurses were wrong what does it mean
that their intuition that having the

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110
that their intuition that having the
 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.500
that their intuition that having the
treatment being relatively short let's

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510
treatment being relatively short let's
 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.530
treatment being relatively short let's
say an hour and tearing bandages one

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540
say an hour and tearing bandages one
 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:51.580
say an hour and tearing bandages one
after the other was the right approach

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590
after the other was the right approach
 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.000
after the other was the right approach
they thought that high spikes and high

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010
they thought that high spikes and high
 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:56.740
they thought that high spikes and high
intensity and duration was the way to go

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750
intensity and duration was the way to go
 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.289
intensity and duration was the way to go
it turns out it was wrong it was much

00:02:59.289 --> 00:02:59.299
it turns out it was wrong it was much
 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:01.509
it turns out it was wrong it was much
better to have a lower intensity and

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519
better to have a lower intensity and
 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:04.599
better to have a lower intensity and
longer duration not to have spikes it

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:04.609
longer duration not to have spikes it
 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:05.949
longer duration not to have spikes it
also turns out you can be better to

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959
also turns out you can be better to
 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:07.599
also turns out you can be better to
start from the most painful part and go

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:07.609
start from the most painful part and go
 

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:09.610
start from the most painful part and go
down over time it would have been good

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620
down over time it would have been good
 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.640
down over time it would have been good
to have breaks and when I came back to

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650
to have breaks and when I came back to
 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.240
to have breaks and when I came back to
present this to them it struck me that

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250
present this to them it struck me that
 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.789
present this to them it struck me that
these were really kind wonderful people

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:18.799
these were really kind wonderful people
 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:21.520
these were really kind wonderful people
they gave their life to to their patient

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530
they gave their life to to their patient
 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.110
they gave their life to to their patient
I mean this was not something that you

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120
I mean this was not something that you
 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.180
I mean this was not something that you
would unless you hit felt like a mission

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190
would unless you hit felt like a mission
 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:26.830
would unless you hit felt like a mission
this is not a job that you would choose

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840
this is not a job that you would choose
 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.559
this is not a job that you would choose
and at the same time they were wrong and

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:29.569
and at the same time they were wrong and
 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:31.720
and at the same time they were wrong and
even though they had vast experience and

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730
even though they had vast experience and
 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:32.979
even though they had vast experience and
the best intention in the world they

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:32.989
the best intention in the world they
 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:35.349
the best intention in the world they
were still very wrong and I started

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:35.359
were still very wrong and I started
 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:37.479
were still very wrong and I started
wondering about what other cases are

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489
wondering about what other cases are
 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:40.240
wondering about what other cases are
there where people have experienced and

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250
there where people have experienced and
 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.180
there where people have experienced and
good intentions but are still

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190
good intentions but are still
 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.409
