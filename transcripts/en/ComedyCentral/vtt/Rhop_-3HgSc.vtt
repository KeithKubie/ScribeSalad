00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.139
- I'm like, "Hell, no, my
sister's wearing

00:00:06.172 --> 00:00:08.174
Garanimals and fucking Wonder
Woman drawers,"

00:00:08.207 --> 00:00:11.577
And this bitch got on a big bra
with the buckles on the back.

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.248
So when I saw her--I just--I
just hit the bitch.

00:00:15.281 --> 00:00:17.984
I was like, "Pow!" I just
started beating her ass.

the one we like to put up on a

00:00:29.128 --> 00:00:30.730

00:00:30.763 --> 00:00:32.165

00:00:32.198 --> 00:00:34.167

00:01:14.106 --> 00:01:15.708
- I was a senior. I'll never
forget it.

00:01:15.741 --> 00:01:17.977
Senior year, last week of
school.

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:19.078
I didn't even have school.

00:01:19.111 --> 00:01:20.713
I'm just running around

00:01:20.746 --> 00:01:22.582
visiting the other
motherfuckers at they school.

00:01:22.615 --> 00:01:24.917
So I'm at Webster High School
with my best friend.

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.053
I'm up there with Vonnie. I'm
like, "Girl,

00:01:27.086 --> 00:01:28.488
"I'm coming up to your school.

00:01:28.521 --> 00:01:30.456
I'm getting myself prepared for
college."

00:01:30.489 --> 00:01:32.225
'Cause I'm letting y'all know
right now,

00:01:32.258 --> 00:01:33.626
at that point, I was going to
art school.

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.394
I knew it in my mind.
I had applied.

00:01:35.427 --> 00:01:36.662
I was just waiting to get me a
scholarship.

00:01:36.695 --> 00:01:38.297
Had my little 16 pieces
together

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.433
for my portfolio review.

00:01:40.466 --> 00:01:42.101
I'm ready for my shit.

00:01:42.134 --> 00:01:43.903
So I was like, "I'm done. I did
my thing.

00:01:43.936 --> 00:01:45.905
I'm visiting, motherfuckers.
I don't need no more grades."

00:01:45.938 --> 00:01:47.573
So I'm thinking I'm cute.
You know how it is back

00:01:47.606 --> 00:01:49.142
in the '80s, everybody walk
around

00:01:49.175 --> 00:01:50.610
with they pinky on they
mouth.

00:01:50.643 --> 00:01:52.678
I'm walking around, next thing
I know,

00:01:52.711 --> 00:01:54.914
I'm at another school.
All I hear is,

00:01:54.947 --> 00:01:56.582
"Diane!

00:01:56.615 --> 00:01:59.085
Diane."

00:01:59.118 --> 00:02:00.486
I said, "Now, wait a minute.

00:02:00.519 --> 00:02:02.455
That do not--ooh, that's my
Mama."

00:02:02.488 --> 00:02:05.424
And I look, and her ass is
sweeping up the hallway

00:02:05.457 --> 00:02:06.826
up in Webster school, right?

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:08.427
I ain't even know her ass was a
janitor.

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:09.962
I ain't know she had these
skills.

00:02:09.995 --> 00:02:11.664
I ain't seen her in five years.

00:02:11.697 --> 00:02:14.100
So now I'm like, "Oh, no, she
not fucking talking to me

00:02:14.133 --> 00:02:16.769
in front of my friends sweeping
up the school."

00:02:16.802 --> 00:02:18.337
So I'm just walking. She's
talking about,

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:19.772
"I know you hear me calling
you."

00:02:19.805 --> 00:02:21.040
And "It's your Mama!"

00:02:21.073 --> 00:02:22.608
I was like, "Oh, Lord."

00:02:22.641 --> 00:02:24.310
Now, you know how kids are.
You embarrassed.

00:02:24.343 --> 00:02:25.678
I'm like, "Hey, Mama, how you
doing?

00:02:25.711 --> 00:02:27.446
I ain't even know you was
back."

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:30.183
"Oh, I love you. I miss you.
How you been?

00:02:30.216 --> 00:02:31.951
What you doing?"

00:02:31.984 --> 00:02:34.153
And I'm standing there like,
"Okay, hurry up with this."

00:02:34.186 --> 00:02:36.689
And she's telling--I'm telling
her I'm about to go to college.

00:02:36.722 --> 00:02:38.191
She don't know none of this
shit.

00:02:38.224 --> 00:02:39.792
She ain't seen me in five
years.

00:02:39.825 --> 00:02:41.294
I'm telling her I'm about to go
to college,

00:02:41.327 --> 00:02:42.728
got my little portfolio
together;

00:02:42.761 --> 00:02:44.697
she talking about, "Oh, I wanna
see it."

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.866
You should bring it up to me.
Bring it to where I live."

00:02:46.899 --> 00:02:48.834
I don't know where the fuck you
live.

00:02:48.867 --> 00:02:51.037
Give me the address, I'ma bring
it, and leave me alone.

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:52.738
'Cause, you know, I'm walking
like this. "Get away from me

00:02:52.771 --> 00:02:54.507
and my friends."

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.876
So I go home, I tell my father,
and he upset.

00:02:56.909 --> 00:02:58.811
'Cause we didn't even know her
ass was back in Missouri.

00:02:58.844 --> 00:03:01.314
And I was like, "I'ma go on and
take it to her,

00:03:01.347 --> 00:03:02.648
"so she can see that I'm, you
know,

00:03:02.681 --> 00:03:03.916
trying to do something
positive."

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:05.251
So he was like, "Well,

00:03:05.284 --> 00:03:06.819
let me see the address."

00:03:06.852 --> 00:03:08.187
So I let him see the address,
and it was in

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.555
this new little project area

00:03:09.588 --> 00:03:11.524
they had just built in St.
Louis.

00:03:11.557 --> 00:03:13.092
They had tore down these one
projects

00:03:13.125 --> 00:03:14.860
and built these new townhouses.

00:03:14.893 --> 00:03:16.896
So my father saw the address.
He was a little reluctant.

00:03:16.929 --> 00:03:18.664
He let me drive his car.

00:03:18.697 --> 00:03:20.433
So I was like, "Let me go on
and take it down here."

00:03:20.466 --> 00:03:22.401
I call my cousin Linda.
That's my ride or die.

00:03:22.434 --> 00:03:23.836
We ride down here.
I was like,

00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:25.071
"Let me go on and take this
down here

00:03:25.104 --> 00:03:26.272
"so my mama can see it

00:03:26.305 --> 00:03:28.574
and leave me the fuck alone."

00:03:28.607 --> 00:03:31.344
So we get out. I knock on the
door.

00:03:31.377 --> 00:03:34.247
Some big burly-ass woman come
to the door.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.848
This bitch lookin' crazy.

00:03:35.881 --> 00:03:37.383
She like, "Can I help you?"
I was like, "Yeah.

00:03:37.416 --> 00:03:38.551
"I'm here to see Dale, my
mother.

00:03:38.584 --> 00:03:40.119
Told me to bring..."

00:03:40.152 --> 00:03:41.954
She like, "Oh, yeah, come on
in."

00:03:41.987 --> 00:03:43.456
So I walk in, it's like,

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:45.591
nine grown bitches just
standing around

00:03:45.624 --> 00:03:49.395
drinking, smoking, listening to
Marvin Gaye and shit.

00:03:49.428 --> 00:03:51.030
And me and my cousin

00:03:51.063 --> 00:03:52.932
we trying to scooch through
these motherfuckers.

00:03:52.965 --> 00:03:55.768
You feeling like--germs--I was
like, "What the fuck?"

00:03:55.801 --> 00:03:59.272
So my mother comes sashaying
down the motherfucking steps

00:03:59.305 --> 00:04:01.574
'cause she all proud now.
I'm her daughter.

00:04:01.607 --> 00:04:03.109
I done showed up with my
portfolio.

00:04:03.142 --> 00:04:04.710
She all coming down
the steps.

00:04:04.743 --> 00:04:07.713
Want me to lay it out and show
everybody.

00:04:07.746 --> 00:04:10.483
She just bragging. "Oh, my baby
did this

00:04:10.516 --> 00:04:12.251
"and she drew that, and that's
a self portrait,

00:04:12.284 --> 00:04:14.654
and my baby did--" And I'm
thinking to myself, "Bitch,

00:04:14.687 --> 00:04:16.155
you ain't help me do nothin'."

00:04:16.188 --> 00:04:18.257
Can I hurry up with this
bullshit?

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:21.394
I gotta get my Daddy's car
back.

00:04:21.427 --> 00:04:23.496
So, you know, she's like,
"Well, I'ma take it.

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:25.064
I'ma keep it." I was like,

00:04:25.097 --> 00:04:26.899
"Mama, you cannot keep my
portfolio down here."

00:04:26.932 --> 00:04:28.601
"Well, you can come pick it up
from my school.

00:04:28.634 --> 00:04:30.636
I wanna show so and so and so
and so."

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:32.905
So me, trying not to argue with
her ass,

00:04:32.938 --> 00:04:35.007
I leave my portfolio with her,
'cause I gotta

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.110
get the fuck up out this area.

00:04:38.143 --> 00:04:40.012
Lo and behold, next day,

00:04:40.045 --> 00:04:41.414
I get a phone call

00:04:41.447 --> 00:04:42.848
from my little sister.

00:04:42.881 --> 00:04:44.617
She's 11 at the time.
I'm, like, 17.

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:46.619
She's on the phone crying,
talking about,

00:04:46.652 --> 00:04:48.587
"Come down here and get me

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.956
because May Cat daughter
Chrissy jumped on me."

00:04:50.989 --> 00:04:53.492
I'm like, "Who the fuck is
Chrissy?"

00:04:53.525 --> 00:04:55.094
So I get down there.

00:04:55.127 --> 00:04:56.529
Me and Linda, 'cause you know

00:04:56.562 --> 00:04:57.863
I'm calling my motherfuckin'
cousin.

00:04:57.896 --> 00:04:59.699
We get down there.

00:04:59.732 --> 00:05:04.770
This big-ass 14-year-old bitch,
she got titties like she 24.

00:05:04.803 --> 00:05:06.639
Fighting my motherfuckin'
11-year-old sister--

00:05:06.672 --> 00:05:07.940
this bitch--
[laughs]

00:05:07.973 --> 00:05:09.275
I'm like, "Aw, hell no."

00:05:09.308 --> 00:05:10.943
My sister's still wearing
Garanimals

00:05:10.976 --> 00:05:12.978
and fuckin' Wonder
Woman drawers.

00:05:13.011 --> 00:05:15.881
And this bitch got on a big bra
with the buckles on the back

00:05:15.914 --> 00:05:17.550
so when I saw her,

00:05:17.583 --> 00:05:20.553
I just--I just hit the bitch.
I was like, "Pow!"

00:05:20.586 --> 00:05:22.121
I just started beating her ass.

00:05:22.154 --> 00:05:23.723
Like, Bitch, you're too big to
be jumping

00:05:23.756 --> 00:05:25.791
on my little-ass
sister.

00:05:25.824 --> 00:05:27.893
I was whuppin' her ass.
I was like, "Fuck that."

00:05:27.926 --> 00:05:29.362
I told my sister, "Get your
shit.

00:05:29.395 --> 00:05:30.796
Get in the car, and let's
go."

00:05:30.829 --> 00:05:32.164
So I took her back to my Daddy
house.

00:05:32.197 --> 00:05:33.466
I called her Daddy.

00:05:33.499 --> 00:05:35.234
He came and got her.

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:41.640
"Uh, I don't know what the fuck
you think you doing,

00:05:41.673 --> 00:05:43.542
"coming down here, jumping on
motherfuckers

00:05:43.575 --> 00:05:45.211
with your grown
ass self."

00:05:45.244 --> 00:05:48.414
I said, "Mama, that girl jumped
on your daughter,

00:05:48.447 --> 00:05:50.649
and she too big to be trying to
fight--"

00:05:50.682 --> 00:05:52.718
"I don't know, but I know one
motherfuckin' thing.

00:05:52.751 --> 00:05:55.654
"You better come down here and
get your motherfuckin'

00:05:55.687 --> 00:05:58.724
portfolio, bitch."

00:05:58.757 --> 00:06:01.160
You know back in the day when
you can't believe some shit.

00:06:01.193 --> 00:06:03.596
You look at the phone--the
old-school phone like,

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:06.499
"I know this bitch did not just
say..."

00:06:06.532 --> 00:06:08.868
I'm--

00:06:08.901 --> 00:06:14.039
Y'all know I'm telling the
truth.

00:06:14.072 --> 00:06:15.408
I said, "Fuck that."

00:06:15.441 --> 00:06:16.909
I'm looking at the phone like,

00:06:16.942 --> 00:06:18.844
"My mama did not just call me a
bitch."

00:06:18.877 --> 00:06:21.414
She called me a grown-ass
bitch.

00:06:21.447 --> 00:06:22.681
"You comin' down--"

00:06:22.714 --> 00:06:24.683
I say, "Okay, I got it."

00:06:24.716 --> 00:06:26.786
Boom. You know who I'm calling.

00:06:26.819 --> 00:06:28.687
My motherfuckin' cousin Linda.

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.356
Live up the street.

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:32.024
I said, "Cuz, we ridin' down
here to get my portfolio.

00:06:32.057 --> 00:06:34.960
Let's go." 'Cause I know my
mama.

00:06:34.993 --> 00:06:37.530
Ten minutes later, I'm down
here in front of May Cat house.

00:06:37.563 --> 00:06:40.199
It's all, the lights out.

00:06:40.232 --> 00:06:41.600
It's serene.

00:06:41.633 --> 00:06:43.436
It's quiet and shit.

00:06:43.469 --> 00:06:45.037
I'm lookin' nervous, 'cause no
shit be quiet in the projects.

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:46.806
I don't give a fuck how new
they are.

00:06:46.839 --> 00:06:48.607
And I'm like, "Why they ain't
go no lights on?"

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:50.609
So I'm knockin' on the door.

00:06:50.642 --> 00:06:52.211
Ain't nobody open the door.

00:06:52.244 --> 00:06:54.447
So me and Linda standing there.
We bangin'.

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.148
Nobody opens the door.

00:06:56.181 --> 00:06:58.717
Next thing I hear the
motherfuckin' window raise up

00:06:58.750 --> 00:06:59.819
on the second floor.

00:06:59.852 --> 00:07:01.654
My mama gonna lean out.

00:07:01.687 --> 00:07:06.926
"Uh, you ain't welcome down
this motherfucker."

00:07:06.959 --> 00:07:08.961
"'Cause you too grown to do the
shit you did.

00:07:08.994 --> 00:07:12.731
"You fuckin' up my situation.
You got somewhere to stay.

00:07:12.764 --> 00:07:15.000
"I ain't got no motherfuckin'
where to stay.

00:07:15.033 --> 00:07:16.836
"And you comin' down here
causing trouble.

00:07:16.869 --> 00:07:20.239
So take your motherfuckin'
portfolio."

00:07:20.272 --> 00:07:22.141
And she just starting tossing
my shit out the window,

00:07:22.174 --> 00:07:23.809
one by one.

00:07:23.842 --> 00:07:26.579
One picture, one--my shit just
floating down like

00:07:26.612 --> 00:07:30.015
a kite with no wind, just
hitting the ground.

00:07:30.048 --> 00:07:31.984
And I'm in fucking amazement,
like,

00:07:32.017 --> 00:07:34.954
"No, this bitch is not throwing
my portfolio pictures--

00:07:34.987 --> 00:07:36.288
"my paintings,

00:07:36.321 --> 00:07:38.357
every motherfuckin' thing out
the window."

00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:40.359
And then she tossed the whole
fuckin' leather case out there.

00:07:40.392 --> 00:07:42.127
So that hit the ground, and I'm
trying to pick my shit up.

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.663
Next thing you know, May Cat
runs out.

00:07:44.696 --> 00:07:47.366
This bitch talking about...
[stomping]

00:07:47.399 --> 00:07:51.136
"And this for jumpin' on my
motherfuckin' daughter."

00:07:51.169 --> 00:07:53.439
And the bitch just starts
stepping all over

00:07:53.472 --> 00:07:55.207
my self portrait.
It's all fucked up.

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:56.308
Now I'm crying.

00:07:56.341 --> 00:07:57.877
And I'm mad.

00:07:57.910 --> 00:07:59.778
We had two quarters. Me and my
cousin, Linda,

00:07:59.811 --> 00:08:02.114
we went to the motherfuckin'
payphone up the street.

00:08:02.147 --> 00:08:04.617
We called all nine of her
sisters with one quarter.

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:07.152
[laughter]

00:08:07.185 --> 00:08:10.956
Pumpkin, Jean--everybody knows
somebody named Pumpkin--

00:08:10.989 --> 00:08:16.462
Jean, Lynn, Azzie, Rhonda,
Tisha, cousin Lynn.

00:08:16.495 --> 00:08:17.830
We used the other quarter to
call

00:08:17.863 --> 00:08:19.465
some other motherfuckin'
cousins,

00:08:19.498 --> 00:08:22.301
waited at the
payphone. Jean rolled up.

00:08:22.334 --> 00:08:24.737
Two cars of motherfuckers.
We rolled right up

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:26.171
in front of that shit.

00:08:26.204 --> 00:08:29.475
My cousin Jean got out the car
first.

00:08:29.508 --> 00:08:32.578
She went up there.
Boom, boom, boom.

00:08:32.611 --> 00:08:34.213
I don't even know who answered
the door, 'cause

00:08:34.246 --> 00:08:35.814
whoever the fuck they called
first, Jean snatched

00:08:35.847 --> 00:08:37.249
the motherfuckin' wig.
[whooshes]

00:08:37.282 --> 00:08:38.884
Everybody just...
[stomps]

00:08:38.917 --> 00:08:40.819
We all--we comin' out of
nowhere.

00:08:40.852 --> 00:08:42.655
Now people running out the
house.

00:08:42.688 --> 00:08:44.423
We fighting like a
motherfucker.

00:08:44.456 --> 00:08:45.991
I was like, "Fuck this."

00:08:46.024 --> 00:08:48.827
And my mama, she don't even
wanna come out.

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:50.396
'Cause she embarrassed,

00:08:50.429 --> 00:08:51.997
but then her friends started
getting fucked up.

00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:53.499
So she had to come out and
help.

00:08:53.532 --> 00:08:55.267
So we started fucking her up,

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:57.169
'cause you out here helping
your friends that fucked me up

00:08:57.202 --> 00:08:58.370
and I'm your daughter.

00:08:58.403 --> 00:09:00.839
So now we just...
[stomping]

00:09:00.872 --> 00:09:02.408
We rumblin' like a m--

00:09:02.441 --> 00:09:04.009
I don't even know how long this
shit went on.

00:09:04.042 --> 00:09:05.344
It might have been on 10, 15
minutes.

00:09:05.377 --> 00:09:07.513
Somebody called the police.

00:09:07.546 --> 00:09:09.181
Somebody called the
police.

00:09:09.214 --> 00:09:12.284
Paddy wagon come, two of 'em.
They takin' this half.

00:09:12.317 --> 00:09:13.953
They take me.

00:09:13.986 --> 00:09:15.721
My cousins, all of us--we down
at the motherfuckin'

00:09:15.754 --> 00:09:17.890
police station just all in a
big rumble.

00:09:17.923 --> 00:09:19.592
They wanna know what's going
on.

00:09:19.625 --> 00:09:21.126
I ain't even have to say shit.

00:09:21.159 --> 00:09:22.962
I let them see my motherfuckin'
portfolio.

00:09:22.995 --> 00:09:26.699
And then they can understand
what had to go down.

00:09:26.732 --> 00:09:29.134
So they let everybody go.

00:09:29.167 --> 00:09:31.203
They couldn't let me go, 'cause
I'm a minor,

00:09:31.236 --> 00:09:33.205
and they wanna release me to a
parent.

00:09:33.238 --> 00:09:36.041
And my dumbass mama talking
about, "Oh, I'm right here.

00:09:36.074 --> 00:09:37.977
You can release her to me."

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:39.979
And they're looking at her
like, "Bitch, please."

00:09:40.012 --> 00:09:44.249
Ain't nobody--bitch, you the
reason why she here.

00:09:44.282 --> 00:09:47.119
Ain't nobody gonna release her
to you.

00:09:47.152 --> 00:09:49.088
I was like--so I had to wait on
my daddy,

00:09:49.121 --> 00:09:52.057
and I'm like, "Oh, shit. I
don't even know how I'm gonna

00:09:52.090 --> 00:09:53.559
explain this to my father."

00:09:53.592 --> 00:09:55.294
So my father comes and get me.

00:09:55.327 --> 00:09:57.229
I'm all crying. I'm mad. I
don't even know what to do.

00:09:57.262 --> 00:09:59.164
'Cause all I can think in the
back of my mind is,

00:09:59.197 --> 00:10:00.899
"I'm not gonna get into
college."

00:10:00.932 --> 00:10:02.901
'Cause my portfolio is fucked
up.

00:10:02.934 --> 00:10:04.470
I got a review in a week.

00:10:04.503 --> 00:10:06.438
I don't even know what I'ma
tell these people.

00:10:06.471 --> 00:10:07.940
I'm just like, "Fuck it."

00:10:07.973 --> 00:10:09.341
Maybe I'm just gonna be working
at UPS.

00:10:09.374 --> 00:10:10.576
I ain't gonna get no fuckin'--

00:10:10.609 --> 00:10:12.344
So when my Dad picked me up,

00:10:12.377 --> 00:10:14.179
I thought he was gonna be mad
and angry.

00:10:14.212 --> 00:10:15.581
He didn't even say shit.

00:10:15.614 --> 00:10:17.349
And when a person don't say
nothing,

00:10:17.382 --> 00:10:18.784
you don't know what's on they
mind and what they thinking.

00:10:18.817 --> 00:10:20.452
You really start to be nervous.

00:10:20.485 --> 00:10:22.021
'Cause all I could hear him
saying, "Look, I told you

00:10:22.054 --> 00:10:23.756
"not to take your ass down
there,

00:10:23.789 --> 00:10:25.290
and you know your
fuckin' mama throw it off."

00:10:25.323 --> 00:10:26.959
All that, I didn't wanna hear
that.

00:10:26.992 --> 00:10:28.627
He didn't say shit.

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:29.862
Soon as we got in the house, he
said,

00:10:29.895 --> 00:10:31.296
"Let me see your
portfolio."

00:10:31.329 --> 00:10:33.098
And he laid it out on the
kitchen table.

00:10:33.131 --> 00:10:34.800
He was like, "You know what,

00:10:34.833 --> 00:10:35.968
"I'm gonna help you get your
shit together.

00:10:36.001 --> 00:10:37.603
We gonna work it out."

00:10:37.636 --> 00:10:39.171
My Daddy helped me tape up my
pictures.

00:10:39.204 --> 00:10:41.206
We was fixing shit, touching
shit up.

00:10:41.239 --> 00:10:43.008
He was like, "You gonna get
that damn scholarship,

00:10:43.041 --> 00:10:44.777
'cause I ain't got it."

00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:47.980
[laughter]
"So your ass is gonna get it!"

00:10:48.013 --> 00:10:50.683
And I'm thinking to myself,

00:10:50.716 --> 00:10:53.652
"I am not going to this
portfolio review

00:10:53.685 --> 00:10:55.287
with my shit looking like
this."

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:57.556
But he made me go.
My father made me go.

00:10:57.589 --> 00:11:00.325
He took me, and I was like,
"Aw, God. I'm nervous."

00:11:00.358 --> 00:11:03.862
I get out. I'm sitting in the
hallway.

00:11:03.895 --> 00:11:06.532
I got my portfolio. They called
me into the room.

00:11:06.565 --> 00:11:08.400
Full of white people in there.

00:11:08.433 --> 00:11:11.336
I'm standing there like, "Oh,
Lord."

00:11:11.369 --> 00:11:13.906
They gonna be looking at me
like, "Oh, this nigga shit."

00:11:13.939 --> 00:11:17.810
When they see my portfolio all
fucked up,

00:11:17.843 --> 00:11:19.878
this is more than the dog at
the homework.

00:11:19.911 --> 00:11:22.147
I can't even say no shit like
that.

00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:24.316
So I'm--they had the little
easel,

00:11:24.349 --> 00:11:26.652
you know, for you to bring your
shit out.

00:11:26.685 --> 00:11:28.554
Oh, I opened up my shit,

00:11:28.587 --> 00:11:30.155
I pulled out my self portrait.

00:11:30.188 --> 00:11:31.724
Now, this the one with the
big-ass footprint on it.

00:11:31.757 --> 00:11:34.660
Right on my--right on the
forehead.

00:11:34.693 --> 00:11:36.995
So I just set it up on the
thing.

00:11:37.028 --> 00:11:39.364
I w--they didn't even give me
an opportunity to explain.

00:11:39.397 --> 00:11:41.233
They said, "Can you just step
out in the hallway

00:11:41.266 --> 00:11:42.768
for a second?"

00:11:42.801 --> 00:11:44.937
And now I'm like, "Aw, what the
fuck?"

00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:47.573
So I'm sitting in the hallway
talking to my dad.

00:11:47.606 --> 00:11:48.941
You know, how you're nervous,

00:11:48.974 --> 00:11:50.442
you're not sure what's going
on.

00:11:50.475 --> 00:11:52.277
I'm just sitting there like,
"What the fuck?"

00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:53.512
They taking forever.
They're not asking me shit.

00:11:53.545 --> 00:11:55.047
I'm just in the hallway.

00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:56.882
The lady comes out about 20
minutes later,

00:11:56.915 --> 00:11:58.350
gives me my portfolio back,

00:11:58.383 --> 00:12:01.386
and she said, "We'll be in
touch with you."

00:12:01.419 --> 00:12:04.022
So now I'm riding home like,
"What the fuck do that mean?"

00:12:04.055 --> 00:12:06.091
They ain't ask me no questions.

00:12:06.124 --> 00:12:07.726
They probably looked at my shit
like,

00:12:07.759 --> 00:12:09.762
"We ain't got time for
this nigga shit."

00:12:09.795 --> 00:12:11.797
They made me sit out here for
no reason.

00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:13.365
So now I'm really angry.
I'm thinking

00:12:13.398 --> 00:12:15.734
of all kind of ways I can get
back at my mama.

00:12:15.767 --> 00:12:17.269
I was like, "I'ma call up her
job,"

00:12:17.302 --> 00:12:18.937
Fuck that--"I'm getting that
bitch fired.

00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:21.573
"I'm--I'ma tell them she got
three IDs.

00:12:21.606 --> 00:12:23.275
"She ain't got no GED.

00:12:23.308 --> 00:12:25.043
"She a alcoholic.

00:12:25.076 --> 00:12:28.547
And she been bringing home
toilet paper from the school."

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:30.048
[laughs]

00:12:30.081 --> 00:12:33.385
I was thinking of all kind of
shit...

00:12:33.418 --> 00:12:36.388
to get her ass fired.

00:12:36.421 --> 00:12:38.724
So...

00:12:38.757 --> 00:12:39.959
[laughing]

00:12:40.926 --> 00:12:42.561
About a month later,

00:12:42.594 --> 00:12:44.263
I got a letter in the mail from
Fontbonne College.

00:12:44.296 --> 00:12:46.398
And it said I got a partial
scholarship.

00:12:46.431 --> 00:12:48.133
I ain't even see the word
"partial."

00:12:48.166 --> 00:12:49.935
All I saw was "scholarship" on
the motherfucker.

00:12:49.968 --> 00:12:51.103
I don't know what it was.

00:12:51.136 --> 00:12:52.437
But I was so fuckin' happy.

00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:53.572
I was like, "Oh, shit!"

00:12:53.605 --> 00:12:55.474
I got in!

00:12:55.507 --> 00:12:57.476
Now, I failed to mention that I
have always been a scrapbooker.

00:12:57.509 --> 00:13:00.679
I love to scrapbook
about--since fourth grade.

00:13:00.712 --> 00:13:02.514
So I copy every fuckin' thing.

00:13:02.547 --> 00:13:04.483
Even today, I was like, "Oh,
get me a copy of these papers."

00:13:04.516 --> 00:13:06.084
I need a copy of everything.

00:13:06.117 --> 00:13:08.086
So I had copied everything.

00:13:08.119 --> 00:13:10.422
I keep everything.
When I got that letter,

00:13:10.455 --> 00:13:14.459
I wrote on that letter,
"I got in, bitch!"

00:13:14.492 --> 00:13:16.461
[laughter]

00:13:16.494 --> 00:13:19.298
And I took it straight to the
post office,

00:13:19.331 --> 00:13:21.767
and I mailed the motherfucker
to May Cat house.

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:23.468
I was like, "Oh, she gonna get
this motherfucker.

00:13:23.501 --> 00:13:25.170
"I'm letting her know despite
all the bullshit

00:13:25.203 --> 00:13:26.505
"y'all did to
me,

00:13:26.538 --> 00:13:28.106
I still got in."

00:13:28.139 --> 00:13:29.641
I mailed the motherfucking
letter.

00:13:29.674 --> 00:13:31.443
It came back a week later.

00:13:31.476 --> 00:13:33.679
I was like, "Aw, this bitch
done moved again."

00:13:33.712 --> 00:13:36.281
So she moved again.

00:13:36.314 --> 00:13:38.784
Never got the letter. She
didn't even fuckin' know.

00:13:38.817 --> 00:13:40.686
So here it is four years later.

00:13:40.719 --> 00:13:42.554
I'm graduating from college.

00:13:42.587 --> 00:13:46.391
I get a call a week before my
graduation from my mama.

00:13:46.424 --> 00:13:48.160
I don't even know where she
was.

00:13:48.193 --> 00:13:49.862
I ain't know how she knew I was
graduating.

00:13:49.895 --> 00:13:51.363
All she wanted to do was come

00:13:51.396 --> 00:13:52.798
and see me walk across the
stage.

00:13:52.831 --> 00:13:54.299
And I'm thinking to myself,

00:13:54.332 --> 00:13:56.802
"Oh, you gonna fuck my
graduation up."

00:13:56.835 --> 00:13:59.872
But I can't stop your ass from
coming, 'cause you know

00:13:59.905 --> 00:14:01.306
about it, obviously.

00:14:01.339 --> 00:14:03.976
So my mother comes to the
graduation.

00:14:04.009 --> 00:14:05.978
I'm there with my dad, my
stepmom.

00:14:06.011 --> 00:14:07.346
And I see her walking up.

00:14:07.379 --> 00:14:09.147
I done already crossed the
stage.

00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:10.749
I'm holding my degree.

00:14:10.782 --> 00:14:12.184
I knew her ass was coming.

00:14:12.217 --> 00:14:14.686
And I had that motherfucking
letter.

00:14:14.719 --> 00:14:15.988
[laughter]

00:14:16.021 --> 00:14:17.522
I had the letter.

00:14:17.555 --> 00:14:19.258
I pulled it out of my
motherfuckin' scrapbook.

00:14:19.291 --> 00:14:20.993
I was like, "Yeah, she gonna
get this letter."

00:14:21.026 --> 00:14:22.728
She gonna get this
motherfuckin' letter.

00:14:22.761 --> 00:14:25.998
So she steps to me, wanna hug
me, all this fake shit,

00:14:26.031 --> 00:14:27.532
and I'm just feeling like,
"Eww."

00:14:27.565 --> 00:14:29.268
So she hugging me,

00:14:29.301 --> 00:14:32.237
"Oh, let me take a picture with
you and your degree."

00:14:32.270 --> 00:14:34.039
I was like, "You can take a
picture with me

00:14:34.072 --> 00:14:35.674
and this
motherfuckin' letter."

00:14:35.707 --> 00:14:38.043
[laughter]

00:14:38.076 --> 00:14:39.177
And I gave her ass that letter.

00:14:39.210 --> 00:14:40.679
I did not take no picture.

00:14:40.712 --> 00:14:42.414
I was like, "Fuck that.
I am outta here."

00:14:42.447 --> 00:14:44.516
And I left quickly, 'cause I
knew if my mama

00:14:44.549 --> 00:14:46.184
open that letter up while I was
standing there,

00:14:46.217 --> 00:14:47.686
she would fuck me up.

00:14:47.719 --> 00:14:50.255
So I gave her that letter.
I was like,

00:14:50.288 --> 00:14:52.925
"You can take a picture with
that."

00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:54.293
I had to get on out of there.

00:14:54.326 --> 00:14:56.194
I'm letting y'all know right
now

00:14:56.227 --> 00:14:58.196
it--because of her, all the bad
shit that happened to me

00:14:58.229 --> 00:15:01.066
made me the good motherfucker
that I am today.

00:15:01.099 --> 00:15:03.368
So I tell people all the time,

00:15:03.401 --> 00:15:05.203
"Do your thing. You never know
what's gonna be

00:15:05.236 --> 00:15:06.872
the catalyst in
your life."

00:15:06.905 --> 00:15:08.874
That's my story.
I hope y'all enjoyed.

00:15:08.907 --> 00:15:10.042
[cheers and applause]
