00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
What do I mean with parallel force? Let's think of Peter pulling his sister, Annie, in a cart.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
He has his rope here, and it's connected to the cart,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and the rope actually makes an angle of 30°.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Well, let me give you some other information. The mass of the cart and Annie together is 25 kg.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
The force that Peter is pulling with is 10 N.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And, I want to know if Peter pulls Annie for 15 m, how much work does he do.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Well, you might be tempted to say, well work, it's just force times distance.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
He is pulling with a force of 10 N over a distance of 15 m.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Shouldn't that be 150 J? The answer is no.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
We shouldn't be using this entire force of 10 N, just the parallel component.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Let me show you what I mean.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I'm going to have to erase Peter and Annie now because this drawing is just getting too cluttered.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Instead, Annie is going to become a box.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Peter is pulling with a force, we'll call Fp, and as always, there is going to be some normal force.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Now, I know the direction of motion of this car is going to be along the street, this way.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
That means I want to break this force into components,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
and this is something we know how to do.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Here, I've broken it into what we can call a parallel component

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
because this line is parallel to the direction of motion, and there's a perpendicular component,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and I remember that this angle is 30°.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Now, can you tell me if Peter pulls Annie for 15 m,

00:01:15.000 --> 99:59:59.000
how much work does he do? Enter your answer here.
