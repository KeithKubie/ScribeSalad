00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.960
So let me take you back into what we

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:03.690
were talking about last time. We were talking about

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:06.710
the iterated prisoners dilemma, and here's the prisoners dilemma

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.440
payoffs that you wrote down for us. You remember this?

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:10.660
&gt;&gt; I vaguely remember this.

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:17.860
&gt;&gt; And remember it was about these two criminals, Smooth and Curly. And they

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.250
were, deciding whether to cooperate or defect

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.660
against each other when, after they've been arrested.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.180
&gt;&gt; Right, and they defect, they always defect. They always

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.630
defect, right. So in particular, we say well what happens if it's, if they have

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.340
multiple rounds in which to interact, and so here they are, here are the two

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.240
of them, and if they've got one round to live, we did an analysis and

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.730
we indicated that there's really nothing they

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.730
can do other than defect against each other.

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:40.283
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:40.283 --> 00:00:42.480
&gt;&gt; It's irrational to do anything else.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:42.690
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.110
&gt;&gt; So we said, all right, well, what happens if we allow

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.450
there to be more than one round? So now we've got two rounds.

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.540
And what we realized was that if you got

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.395
two rounds to go, then these players essentially, face a

00:00:55.395 --> 00:00:59.050
one-round game because, after this round, what they're going to do

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.770
in the last round has already been determined. So it's

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.700
almost as if that round doesn't really matter. There's nothing

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.740
we can do now that's going to change what they're going

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.880
to do in that last round, so it's sort of

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.950
like there's just one round and we're going to defect again.

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.870
&gt;&gt; Right, so life is terrible and everyone is out to get everyone else.

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:15.900
&gt;&gt; Exactly, and

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.130
not only is it for two rounds, but this

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.630
same argument continues as you go three rounds or more.

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.750
&gt;&gt; Oh, it's like a proof by induction.

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.650
&gt;&gt; It's kind of like a proof by induction, yeah, well it's proof by ellipsis.

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.135
&gt;&gt; Mm, that's my favorite kind of induction. Proof by ellipsis.

00:01:29.135 --> 00:01:33.010
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So the question then becomes, what

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:37.320
happens if the, number of rounds left is unknown,

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.020
right? So what we've realized is that if

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.450
you know how many rounds are left, the whole

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.230
thing comes unraveled and they're just going to defect forever. But we raised

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:47.200
the issue of, what happens if the number of rounds left is unknown?

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.420
&gt;&gt; Hm.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.170
&gt;&gt; And it seems like it shouldn't really make any

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.410
difference because if it's say some finite number we just

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:54.340
don't know what it is, then it seems like it

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.970
should still reduce to this same setup that we have.

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.850
So I was looking into this and it turns out

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.760
that is it's not the case it actually does make

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.040
a difference and it's, it's really interesting how it goes

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.930
and how it connects back with other things we've talked about.

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:06.720
&gt;&gt; Woo, tell me more.
