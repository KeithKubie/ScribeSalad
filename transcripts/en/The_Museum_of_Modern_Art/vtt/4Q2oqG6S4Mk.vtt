00:00:06.354 --> 00:00:09.316
Phil: Intaglio is a printmaking process

00:00:09.316 --> 00:00:11.529
or a category of printmaking.

00:00:11.529 --> 00:00:13.756
Intaglio is a way in which we transfer an

00:00:13.756 --> 00:00:16.178
image from a plate to a piece of paper.

00:00:16.445 --> 00:00:19.389
Intaglio is based on
the fact that the image

00:00:19.389 --> 00:00:22.324
area is below the flat
surface of the plate.

00:00:22.718 --> 00:00:25.057
Within intaglio there are several types

00:00:25.057 --> 00:00:28.057
or categories, or processes of printmaking

00:00:28.057 --> 00:00:29.525
that you might be familiar with.

00:00:29.694 --> 00:00:32.362
One is drypoint, which is a direct marring

00:00:32.362 --> 00:00:35.067
or scarring of the surface
of a piece of metal

00:00:35.067 --> 00:00:39.079
or another plate by moving
metal versus removing it.

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:42.475
When you scratch on a
drypoint plate, you are

00:00:42.475 --> 00:00:45.611
creating a burr or a
raised metal from the metal

00:00:45.611 --> 00:00:46.778
that you've moved.

00:00:46.778 --> 00:00:49.276
Ink can sit underneath
that burr as well as

00:00:49.276 --> 00:00:51.441
in the V-trough where the scratch was.

00:00:51.441 --> 00:00:54.883
Etching is another intaglio process.

00:00:54.883 --> 00:00:57.858
It is based on the
removal of metal through

00:00:57.858 --> 00:01:01.746
a chemical process, etching
with an acid or a base.

00:01:01.946 --> 00:01:04.028
This is different than drypoint.

00:01:04.028 --> 00:01:07.526
Drypoint's scratching of the
plate is to create a burr

00:01:07.526 --> 00:01:09.023
or to move metal.

00:01:09.023 --> 00:01:11.906
In this case we're actually
only barely scratching

00:01:11.906 --> 00:01:14.655
the surface just to remove the ground.

00:01:14.694 --> 00:01:17.279
The image area is created
in a similar format

00:01:17.279 --> 00:01:19.978
being that it's the recesses of the plate

00:01:19.978 --> 00:01:21.441
that hold the ink that allow us

00:01:21.441 --> 00:01:25.441
to transfer it to paper.
