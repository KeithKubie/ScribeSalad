00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.344
Let's try this method of dividing the numerator by the denominator to find the

00:00:03.344 --> 00:00:08.488
horizontal asymptote with this new function. F of x equals 3x minus 8 over x

00:00:08.488 --> 00:00:15.199
minus 5. What do you get if you divide 3x minus 8 by x minus 5? Put your answer

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:16.160
in this box.
