rockland county to do this they used an

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340
rockland county to do this they used an
 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.099
rockland county to do this they used an
excel-based software program which was

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:43.109
excel-based software program which was
 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:44.509
excel-based software program which was
provided by the Alliance for water

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519
provided by the Alliance for water
 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:47.000
provided by the Alliance for water
efficiency and we also use the same

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010
efficiency and we also use the same
 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.319
efficiency and we also use the same
software in our sensitivity analysis so

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:51.329
software in our sensitivity analysis so
 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:52.670
software in our sensitivity analysis so
the significance of the sensitivity

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680
the significance of the sensitivity
 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.250
the significance of the sensitivity
analysis is because last semesters

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260
analysis is because last semesters
 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:56.750
analysis is because last semesters
project relied on a number of

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760
project relied on a number of
 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.479
project relied on a number of
assumptions as inputs for their model

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489
assumptions as inputs for their model
 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:01.670
assumptions as inputs for their model
for example they had to guess how many

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680
for example they had to guess how many
 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.530
for example they had to guess how many
people would participate in each program

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540
people would participate in each program
 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.140
people would participate in each program
they were reasonably estimated guesses

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150
they were reasonably estimated guesses
 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.890
they were reasonably estimated guesses
but they were still guesses so the

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900
but they were still guesses so the
 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.809
but they were still guesses so the
sensitivity analysis looks at how much

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:11.819
sensitivity analysis looks at how much
 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:13.910
sensitivity analysis looks at how much
variation will occur in our outputs if

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920
variation will occur in our outputs if
 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.430
variation will occur in our outputs if
we make changes in our assumptions to do

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440
we make changes in our assumptions to do
 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.860
we make changes in our assumptions to do
this we performed research and used case

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870
this we performed research and used case
 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.930
this we performed research and used case
studies to project a reasonable range of

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940
studies to project a reasonable range of
 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.690
studies to project a reasonable range of
variations and our inputs and we

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700
variations and our inputs and we
 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.140
variations and our inputs and we
recorded the effect on our results it's

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150
recorded the effect on our results it's
 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:28.550
recorded the effect on our results it's
also important because it tests the

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560
also important because it tests the
 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.830
also important because it tests the
stability of last semesters work and it

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840
stability of last semesters work and it
 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.210
stability of last semesters work and it
supports decision making and

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220
supports decision making and
 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.040
supports decision making and
recommendations that may stem from the

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050
recommendations that may stem from the
 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.920
recommendations that may stem from the
work that we've

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930
work that we've
 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:39.050
work that we've
in the workshop for our methodology we

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060
in the workshop for our methodology we
 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.760
in the workshop for our methodology we
based our analysis on two models there

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770
based our analysis on two models there
 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:43.320
based our analysis on two models there
is a conservative model and an

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330
is a conservative model and an
 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.749
is a conservative model and an
optimistic model these models both took

00:04:45.749 --> 00:04:45.759
optimistic model these models both took
 

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:47.670
optimistic model these models both took
into account several variables that

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680
into account several variables that
 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.469
into account several variables that
might success that might affect the

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:49.479
might success that might affect the
 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:52.650
might success that might affect the
success of our outputs as well as the

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:52.660
success of our outputs as well as the
 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.540
success of our outputs as well as the
variables that we personally changed

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.550
variables that we personally changed
 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:56.490
variables that we personally changed
which were the participation rate and

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500
which were the participation rate and
 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.430
which were the participation rate and
the unit water savings for each program

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440
the unit water savings for each program
 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.499
the unit water savings for each program
we then recorded the gross water savings

00:05:01.499 --> 00:05:01.509
we then recorded the gross water savings
 

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:03.900
we then recorded the gross water savings
and the utility and customer benefit

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:03.910
and the utility and customer benefit
 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:06.060
and the utility and customer benefit
cost ratios we did this for each

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:06.070
cost ratios we did this for each
 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:08.010
cost ratios we did this for each
individual program and then we combined

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.020
individual program and then we combined
 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.330
individual program and then we combined
all of our programs into an ultimate

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340
all of our programs into an ultimate
 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.620
all of our programs into an ultimate
optimistic and an ultimate conservative

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:13.630
optimistic and an ultimate conservative
 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:15.930
optimistic and an ultimate conservative
to get an idea of what the total range

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:15.940
to get an idea of what the total range
 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.370
to get an idea of what the total range
could be if we implemented these

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:17.380
could be if we implemented these
 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:22.680
could be if we implemented these
programs so I'm just going to take you

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:22.690
programs so I'm just going to take you
 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:23.790
programs so I'm just going to take you
through an example of one of the

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:23.800
through an example of one of the
 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.409
through an example of one of the
programs that we looked at which was the

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:25.419
programs that we looked at which was the
 

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:28.170
programs that we looked at which was the
water waste ordinance so we examined a

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:28.180
water waste ordinance so we examined a
 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:30.300
water waste ordinance so we examined a
generic outdoor water conservation

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:30.310
generic outdoor water conservation
 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:33.270
generic outdoor water conservation
ordinance which didn't have anything to

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:33.280
ordinance which didn't have anything to
 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.909
ordinance which didn't have anything to
do with rebates or special water-saving

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:35.919
do with rebates or special water-saving
 

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:37.830
do with rebates or special water-saving
technology it was simply an ordinance

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:37.840
technology it was simply an ordinance
 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.779
technology it was simply an ordinance
that would say for example you cannot

00:05:39.779 --> 00:05:39.789
that would say for example you cannot
 

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:44.700
that would say for example you cannot
water your lawn on X days last semesters

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:44.710
water your lawn on X days last semesters
 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:45.930
water your lawn on X days last semesters
report didn't really have very much

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:45.940
report didn't really have very much
 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:48.210
report didn't really have very much
research based on the water savings or

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:48.220
research based on the water savings or
 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:49.920
research based on the water savings or
participation rates so we really focused

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:49.930
participation rates so we really focused
 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:52.200
participation rates so we really focused
on that one way we did this was we used

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:52.210
on that one way we did this was we used
 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:54.810
on that one way we did this was we used
the United Water survey to get an idea

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:54.820
the United Water survey to get an idea
 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:57.600
the United Water survey to get an idea
of how many people how many people water

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:57.610
of how many people how many people water
 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:59.399
of how many people how many people water
their lawns in Rockland County on a

00:05:59.399 --> 00:05:59.409
their lawns in Rockland County on a
 

00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:01.770
their lawns in Rockland County on a
regular basis we also took into account

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:01.780
regular basis we also took into account
 

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:04.680
regular basis we also took into account
a couple other important assumptions one

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:04.690
a couple other important assumptions one
 

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:06.719
a couple other important assumptions one
of which was the potential annual unit

00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:06.729
of which was the potential annual unit
 

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:08.820
of which was the potential annual unit
water savings which we calculated to be

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:08.830
water savings which we calculated to be
 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:12.210
water savings which we calculated to be
81 gallons per household per day and we

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:12.220
81 gallons per household per day and we
 

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:14.580
81 gallons per household per day and we
got this from a combination of the of

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:14.590
got this from a combination of the of
 

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:15.749

conservative and this is this takes into

00:06:28.499 --> 00:06:28.509
conservative and this is this takes into
 

00:06:28.509 --> 00:06:31.080
conservative and this is this takes into
account how often regular lawn watering

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:31.090
account how often regular lawn watering
 

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:33.390

ordinance would be implemented so for
our results we found that the ordinance

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:38.620
our results we found that the ordinance
 

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:41.010
our results we found that the ordinance
program was cost effect can be

less semesters work we also saw
 

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:51.930
less semesters work we also saw
meaningful water savings achieved in

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:51.940
meaningful water savings achieved in
 

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:55.160
meaningful water savings achieved in
both scenarios which amounted to about

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:55.170
both scenarios which amounted to about
 

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:57.240
both scenarios which amounted to about
360,000 gallons per day in the

optimistic and 80,000 in the
 

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:00.630
optimistic and 80,000 in the
conservative these are definitely

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:00.640
conservative these are definitely
 

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:02.910
conservative these are definitely
meaningful because our standard is the

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:02.920
meaningful because our standard is the
 

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:04.680
meaningful because our standard is the
projected long-term supply requirement

projected long-term supply requirement
 

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:12.000
projected long-term supply requirement
of 7.5 million gallons per day so there

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:12.010
of 7.5 million gallons per day so there
 

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:13.410
of 7.5 million gallons per day so there
are a couple there are a few programs

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:13.420
are a couple there are a few programs
 

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:14.880
are a couple there are a few programs
that were consistently cost effective

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:14.890
that were consistently cost effective
 

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:17.220
that were consistently cost effective
both last year in this last semester in

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:17.230
both last year in this last semester in
 

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:19.440
both last year in this last semester in
this semester there was a residential

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:19.450
this semester there was a residential
 

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:21.270
this semester there was a residential
high-efficiency toilet rebate program

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:21.280
high-efficiency toilet rebate program
 

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:23.790
high-efficiency toilet rebate program
there was the wastewater the water waste

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:23.800
there was the wastewater the water waste
 

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:25.590
there was the wastewater the water waste
ordinance and the single-family high

efficiency washer rebate program that

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:27.880
efficiency washer rebate program that
 

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:30.120
efficiency washer rebate program that
would require a slight modification for

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:30.130
would require a slight modification for
 

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:32.940
would require a slight modification for
mission eligibility but it was cost

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:32.950
mission eligibility but it was cost
 

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:34.950
mission eligibility but it was cost
effective with that modification and we

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:34.960
effective with that modification and we
 

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:38.790
effective with that modification and we
do recommend that we also found that in

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:38.800
do recommend that we also found that in
 

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:41.100
do recommend that we also found that in
our cumulative q middle of model where

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:41.110
our cumulative q middle of model where
 

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:43.500
our cumulative q middle of model where
we put all the individual programs

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:43.510
we put all the individual programs
 

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:46.350
we put all the individual programs
together that there was a total water

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:46.360
together that there was a total water
 

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:49.470
together that there was a total water
savings in 2021 of over 3 million

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:49.480
savings in 2021 of over 3 million
 

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:51.300
savings in 2021 of over 3 million
gallons in the optimistic model and over

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:51.310
gallons in the optimistic model and over
 

00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:52.830
gallons in the optimistic model and over
1 million gallons in the conservative

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:52.840
1 million gallons in the conservative
 

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:54.930
1 million gallons in the conservative
model and again this is measured against

00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:54.940
model and again this is measured against
 

00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:58.620
model and again this is measured against
that 7.5 million gallon per day standard

00:07:58.620 --> 00:07:58.630
that 7.5 million gallon per day standard
 

00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:02.460
that 7.5 million gallon per day standard
so it is meaningful so this chart just

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:02.470
so it is meaningful so this chart just
 

00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:04.740
so it is meaningful so this chart just
shows all the projected water saving

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:04.750

00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:38.080
toilet rebate program that combined with
 

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:40.380

the washer program comprised two-thirds
 

00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:43.980

what was the big surprise for this

00:18:39.899 --> 00:18:39.909
what was the big surprise for this
 

00:18:39.909 --> 00:18:41.789
what was the big surprise for this
coming at this video me you guys were

00:18:41.789 --> 00:18:41.799
coming at this video me you guys were
 

00:18:41.799 --> 00:18:45.180
coming at this video me you guys were
building on data from previous semester

00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:45.190
building on data from previous semester
 

00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:46.379
building on data from previous semester
so I'm just wondering if there was

00:18:46.379 --> 00:18:46.389
so I'm just wondering if there was
 

00:18:46.389 --> 00:18:47.639
so I'm just wondering if there was
something that happened that you were

00:18:47.639 --> 00:18:47.649
something that happened that you were
 

00:18:47.649 --> 00:18:49.680
something that happened that you were
shocked to see or was it really just

00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:49.690
shocked to see or was it really just
 

00:18:49.690 --> 00:18:56.849
shocked to see or was it really just
what you expected basically what we

00:18:56.849 --> 00:18:56.859
what you expected basically what we
 

00:18:56.859 --> 00:18:58.859
what you expected basically what we
noticed because there was seven

00:18:58.859 --> 00:18:58.869
noticed because there was seven
 

00:18:58.869 --> 00:19:00.659
noticed because there was seven
different water conservation program

00:19:00.659 --> 00:19:00.669
different water conservation program
 

00:19:00.669 --> 00:19:02.279
different water conservation program
water students programs from last

00:19:02.279 --> 00:19:02.289
water students programs from last
 

00:19:02.289 --> 00:19:04.589
water students programs from last
semester and then it was narrowed down

00:19:04.589 --> 00:19:04.599
semester and then it was narrowed down
 

00:19:04.599 --> 00:19:05.820
semester and then it was narrowed down
to five that were found be

00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:05.830
to five that were found be
 

00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:07.440
to five that were found be
cost-effective last semester and then

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:07.450
cost-effective last semester and then
 

00:19:07.450 --> 00:19:09.149
cost-effective last semester and then
this semester we found that the major

00:19:09.149 --> 00:19:09.159
this semester we found that the major
 

00:19:09.159 --> 00:19:11.219
this semester we found that the major
one that was the most cost-effective and

00:19:11.219 --> 00:19:11.229
one that was the most cost-effective and
 

00:19:11.229 --> 00:19:13.859
one that was the most cost-effective and
duct tape saved a lot of water and also

00:19:13.859 --> 00:19:13.869
duct tape saved a lot of water and also
 

00:19:13.869 --> 00:19:15.930
duct tape saved a lot of water and also
had a very high on benefit cost ratio

00:19:15.930 --> 00:19:15.940
had a very high on benefit cost ratio
 

00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:18.599
had a very high on benefit cost ratio
was the high efficiency toilets for the

00:19:18.599 --> 00:19:18.609
was the high efficiency toilets for the
 

00:19:18.609 --> 00:19:21.239
was the high efficiency toilets for the
earth Nigel homes so in addition to

00:19:21.239 --> 00:19:21.249
earth Nigel homes so in addition to
 

00:19:21.249 --> 00:19:23.580
earth Nigel homes so in addition to
saving a lot of months leaving a lot of

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:23.590
saving a lot of months leaving a lot of
 

00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:27.330
saving a lot of months leaving a lot of
water also it's a very cost effective

00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:27.340
water also it's a very cost effective
 

00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:31.480
water also it's a very cost effective
program

00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:31.490
 
 

00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:33.340
 
and on the case study said well we

00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:33.350
and on the case study said well we
 

00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:34.720
and on the case study said well we
didn't really the reason why I be looked

00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:34.730
didn't really the reason why I be looked
 

00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:36.490
didn't really the reason why I be looked
into this to begin with was be his last

00:19:36.490 --> 00:19:36.500
into this to begin with was be his last
 

00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:39.220
into this to begin with was be his last
semester so last semester is focus on

00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:39.230
semester so last semester is focus on
 

00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:41.770
semester so last semester is focus on
analyzing these different programs they

00:19:41.770 --> 00:19:41.780
analyzing these different programs they
 

00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:43.840
analyzing these different programs they
took up to analyze the range the

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:43.850
took up to analyze the range the
 

00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:45.760
took up to analyze the range the
sensitivity analysis in the case study

00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:45.770
sensitivity analysis in the case study
 

00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:47.980
sensitivity analysis in the case study
one of the programs that was the least

00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:47.990
one of the programs that was the least
 

00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:50.049
one of the programs that was the least
well researched was the one that the

00:19:50.049 --> 00:19:50.059
well researched was the one that the
 

00:19:50.059 --> 00:19:53.950
well researched was the one that the
case studies are took up I I don't know

00:19:53.950 --> 00:19:53.960
case studies are took up I I don't know
 

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:55.090

studies well I think one of the major

00:20:01.390 --> 00:20:01.400
studies well I think one of the major
 

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:03.730
studies well I think one of the major
surprises was how they enforce these

00:20:03.730 --> 00:20:03.740
surprises was how they enforce these
 

00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:06.010
surprises was how they enforce these

reduce per capita consumption by thirty
percent they do not even have officers

00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:15.320
percent they do not even have officers
 

00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:16.660

education positive I found as well

00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:21.070
education positive I found as well
 

00:20:21.070 --> 00:20:23.310
education positive I found as well
same in New York even when there wasn't

00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:23.320
same in New York even when there wasn't
 

00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:25.680
same in New York even when there wasn't
ordinance in place didn't mean that

00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:25.690
ordinance in place didn't mean that
 

00:20:25.690 --> 00:20:27.749
ordinance in place didn't mean that
anyone knew about it we we talk to

00:20:27.749 --> 00:20:27.759
anyone knew about it we we talk to
 

00:20:27.759 --> 00:20:29.519
anyone knew about it we we talk to
people even within the water department

00:20:29.519 --> 00:20:29.529
people even within the water department
 

00:20:29.529 --> 00:20:31.549
people even within the water department
and some people said what our next

00:20:31.549 --> 00:20:31.559
and some people said what our next
 

00:20:31.559 --> 00:20:34.019
and some people said what our next
option because it was driving the 80s

00:20:34.019 --> 00:20:34.029
option because it was driving the 80s
 

00:20:34.029 --> 00:20:37.289
option because it was driving the 80s
and it hasn't been revised since so I

00:20:37.289 --> 00:20:37.299
and it hasn't been revised since so I
 

00:20:37.299 --> 00:20:39.149
and it hasn't been revised since so I
was specifically surprised about that

00:20:39.149 --> 00:20:39.159
was specifically surprised about that
 

00:20:39.159 --> 00:20:41.549
was specifically surprised about that
part of it yeah late a lot of them seem

00:20:41.549 --> 00:20:41.559
part of it yeah late a lot of them seem
 

00:20:41.559 --> 00:20:43.370
part of it yeah late a lot of them seem
to be the most aware about the

00:20:43.370 --> 00:20:43.380
to be the most aware about the
 

00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:45.269
to be the most aware about the
ordinances they had during water

00:20:45.269 --> 00:20:45.279
ordinances they had during water
 

00:20:45.279 --> 00:20:47.730
ordinances they had during water
emergency so for drought conditions and

00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:47.740
emergency so for drought conditions and
 

00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:50.460
emergency so for drought conditions and
that seems to be the greatest focused in

00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:50.470
that seems to be the greatest focused in
 

00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:52.169
that seems to be the greatest focused in
the most immediate area around Rockland

00:20:52.169 --> 00:20:52.179
the most immediate area around Rockland
 

00:20:52.179 --> 00:20:55.259
the most immediate area around Rockland
so either they weren't really they

00:20:55.259 --> 00:20:55.269
so either they weren't really they
 

00:20:55.269 --> 00:20:57.899
so either they weren't really they
didn't have any non revis ordinances or

00:20:57.899 --> 00:20:57.909
didn't have any non revis ordinances or
 

00:20:57.909 --> 00:21:00.330
didn't have any non revis ordinances or
it just wasn't really a focus or have

00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:00.340
it just wasn't really a focus or have
 

00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:02.249
it just wasn't really a focus or have
even been sort of just like forgotten

00:21:02.249 --> 00:21:02.259
even been sort of just like forgotten
 

00:21:02.259 --> 00:21:05.090
even been sort of just like forgotten
about in the meantime

00:21:05.090 --> 00:21:05.100
about in the meantime
 

00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:06.890
about in the meantime
I'm just going along with what Aaron

00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:06.900
I'm just going along with what Aaron
 

00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:10.880
I'm just going along with what Aaron
said before I dive in to research in my

00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:10.890
said before I dive in to research in my
 

00:21:10.890 --> 00:21:13.100
said before I dive in to research in my
ordinances I felt that probably the more

00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:13.110
ordinances I felt that probably the more
 

00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:15.950
ordinances I felt that probably the more
you spend on like enforcement maybe the

00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:15.960
you spend on like enforcement maybe the
 

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:18.110
you spend on like enforcement maybe the
better results you will get but what I

00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:18.120
better results you will get but what I
 

00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:20.180
better results you will get but what I
found out through my research a long

00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:20.190
found out through my research a long
 

00:21:20.190 --> 00:21:21.950
found out through my research a long
time when you actually don't even have a

00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:21.960
time when you actually don't even have a
 

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:24.500
time when you actually don't even have a
budget for enforcement you actually see

00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:24.510
budget for enforcement you actually see
 

00:21:24.510 --> 00:21:25.450
budget for enforcement you actually see
a lot

00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:25.460
a lot
 

00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:27.519
a lot
actually for example neighbors touching

00:21:27.519 --> 00:21:27.529
actually for example neighbors touching
 

00:21:27.529 --> 00:21:29.529
actually for example neighbors touching
each other and looking for violators

00:21:29.529 --> 00:21:29.539
each other and looking for violators
 

00:21:29.539 --> 00:21:33.430
each other and looking for violators
when you have even other restrictions so

00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:33.440
when you have even other restrictions so
 

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:35.139
when you have even other restrictions so
there's actually a lot of waste very

00:21:35.139 --> 00:21:35.149
there's actually a lot of waste very
 

00:21:35.149 --> 00:21:39.150
there's actually a lot of waste very
cost effective ways to enforce

00:21:39.150 --> 00:21:39.160
cost effective ways to enforce
 

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:47.130
cost effective ways to enforce
