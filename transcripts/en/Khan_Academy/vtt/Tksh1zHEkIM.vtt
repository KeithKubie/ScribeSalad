00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:01.530
My name's Sal Khan.

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:04.550
I'm the founder and faculty
of the Khan Academy,

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:09.276
and it's most known for a
library of 2,000 plus videos

00:00:09.276 --> 00:00:10.650
on everything from
basic addition

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.404
all the way up to calculus
and biology and chemistry.

00:00:13.404 --> 00:00:14.820
But what we're
really trying to do

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.300
is build a free, not for
profit virtual school

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.650
that anybody can go.

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.650
There are the videos, but
there's also software.

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:23.460
They can start at
basic concepts and then

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.630
just keep moving up until
they know calculus and physics

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.610
and whatever else.

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:30.685
The details have yet
to be worked out.

00:00:30.685 --> 00:00:32.060
But what we're
building-- we talk

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:33.240
that it's a virtual
school, but we actually

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.656
do see it as kind
of the operating

00:00:34.656 --> 00:00:36.444
system for the
school of the future,

00:00:36.444 --> 00:00:37.860
and we're starting
trials already.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.526
And the model we're
experimenting with--

00:00:39.526 --> 00:00:41.310
and it seems to be
working-- is you

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:43.410
use the self-paced software.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.640
You use the video.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.260
You use the technology
for every student

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:49.640
to work at their own pace.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.344
So literally you have a class
of-- you could have 30 students

00:00:52.344 --> 00:00:54.010
or 50 students or
however many students,

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.790
and they actually don't all
have to be the same age.

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.498
Preferably they're
all of different ages,

00:00:57.498 --> 00:00:59.156
all of different skill levels.

00:00:59.156 --> 00:01:01.030
And they use something
like the Khan Academy.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.680
They all work at their own pace.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.769
And the teacher now doesn't
have to give lectures,

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:05.730
doesn't have to grade
homework, doesn't

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:08.521
have to do anything other
than-- they have a real time

00:01:08.521 --> 00:01:09.020
dashboard.

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.353
We actually have this already,
but they have a real time

00:01:11.353 --> 00:01:13.600
dashboard where they see
where every student is,

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.830
working at their own pace.

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:16.550
And it just highlights
the kids that are stuck.

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:18.115
Not the kids that are behind or
the kids that are ahead, just

00:01:18.115 --> 00:01:19.114
the kids that are stuck.

00:01:19.114 --> 00:01:21.870
They've already done 100
computer-generated exercises.

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.300
Most students who've done
100 exercises have moved on.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.490
This student hasn't.

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.210
And the model is-- as a
first point of intervention,

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:29.960
actually, the teacher
or even the software

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.168
can say, why don't you pair
up those two students who

00:01:32.168 --> 00:01:34.120
are stuck on negative
numbers, why don't you

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.830
pair them up with Susie who's
already gotten through that

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.110
and have her teach them.

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:40.860
And then you have this
whole peer to peer,

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.068
when you actually teach
something you learn it better

00:01:43.068 --> 00:01:45.730
and scales up the whole-- it
makes it a social experience.

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.074
But if that doesn't work or
if Susie's not available,

00:01:48.074 --> 00:01:49.240
then the teacher goes there.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.887
And the teacher does a very
focused, one on one or one

00:01:51.887 --> 00:01:52.720
on two intervention.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:53.880
So it changes the model.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.960
So every minute of a teacher's
time is actually very focused.

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.940
But because it's
very-- you don't

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.650
want kids spending the whole
day on a computer just clicking

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.300
on problems.

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.289
So I'd see you spend
maybe two hours a day

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:12.040
doing that, to get your
core kind of knowledge

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.740
out of the way.

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.370
You do that, you're going
to do well on the SAT.

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:15.744
You're going to
pass the AP test.

00:02:15.744 --> 00:02:19.556
You're going to know how
to grammatically write

00:02:19.556 --> 00:02:20.990
a sentence, all of the rest.

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.830
But what it does is it frees
up the rest of the day so you

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.720
can actually do actual
creative projects.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.420
I mean, there's a lot of talk
about project-based learning.

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.430
But very little of
it is actual, real,

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.010
kind of liberated
creative stuff.

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.510
Yeah.

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.360
I see the school of
the future, big school

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.881
room, every kid working at
their own pace, a lot of time

00:02:35.881 --> 00:02:36.380
freed up.

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.380
And the teacher's now a
coach, and a lot of time

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.570
freed up for kids to
really be creative.
