00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.590
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It turns out the two car companies would never cost the same. For a one hour

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:09.561
car rental, Rad Rentals would cost $20 and Mini-Hoopties would cost $30. We know

00:00:09.561 --> 00:00:14.180
Rad Rentals is the cheaper option here. The same is true for a five hour car

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:19.237
rental. Rad Rentals would cost $60. And Mini-Hoopties would cost $70. We can see

00:00:19.237 --> 00:00:23.398
on our graph that Rad Rentals, or its cost, is always below the cost of

00:00:23.398 --> 00:00:28.166
Mini-Hoopties. Getting a car from Rad Rentals will be always be less than one

00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:31.979
from Mini-Hoopties. So, we know they'll never cost the same.
