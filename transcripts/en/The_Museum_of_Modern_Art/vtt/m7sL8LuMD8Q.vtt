“This may be a historic document.”

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:08.480
There are famous quotes of Warhol saying 
“I’ve stopped painting. I'm now making movies"

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.120
My name is Greg Pierce.

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:14.400
I'm the Associate Curator of Film and Video at the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.520
Today we're going to take a look at Andy Warhol's 1966 double-screen film "The Chelsea Girls."

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.520
"The children never come up to their expectations."

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.320
"I don't believe in that"

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.280
Even if you watch the film two or three times,
your focus is going to change, so it’s always

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.949
going to have a different narrative for yourself.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.769
So every viewer ends up making
their own narrative for this.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:45.340
It’s dealing with a scene that
no one in the mainstream basically ever gets to look into.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.260
So, it was a window.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:48.829
For some it was, like, a vision of hell…

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:51.700
This window into this freak scene.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.780
And to others, it’s like the Iliad of the underground.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.600
Or, you know, there are other comparisons
to, like, Joyce and Dante.

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:12.680
When "The Chelsea Girls" first premiered, it
was made up of twelve individual reels that

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.340
weren’t locked into place yet.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.650
So, early on the projectionists were allowed
to, you know, with input from Warhol and company,

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.360
reorder the reels for different screenings.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.560
It’s kind of Warhol’s first foray into
this idea where the filmmaker makes something,

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.880
but then it’s not finished until the projectionist
actually creates it in the theater itself.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.300
Eventually, when the film became popular and
it moved to the uptown cinemas, there was

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.800
need for a script for the projectionists to
follow so that they knew what to do with the

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.840
twelve reels they were given to project.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.640
Which is the standard version that
we know of as "The Chelsea Girls."

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.720
There's a set 12 reels, and there's a set
order for the way you show them and how you

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.640
manipulate the sound on them.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.600
The films are dirty.

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.310
And I mean that sometimes in subject matter,
but also just in, like…

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.660
it's the physicality of it.

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.630
Like, the way they look.

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.350
There’s no beginning, middle, and end to
this film.

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:18.650
It's not a narrative that way.

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.250
There is a loose narrative that all these
things take place at a place called…

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.580
at least what we're assuming is the Chelsea Hotel.

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.550
And these are the denizens of this hotel,
and this is what they do in their different

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.520
rooms.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:31.520
“Your girlfriend was beautiful."

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.160
"Your mother was beautiful."

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.840
"Your father was beautiful."

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.960
"All the friends you ever knew…”

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:41.640
It’s a pretty powerful blend of the scripted
and the non-scripted.

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:48.440
And it really kind of showcases what Warhol's
cinema was capable of producing in the sense of

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:54.880
personalities trying to follow a script, losing
the script, not stopping the camera, and allowing

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.320
a new reality to come out of that.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.120
"What else should I speak about?"

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:10.360
"I can't think. I'm just annoyed at this scene and my participation in it, although my participation was perfect"

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.360
"Oh hello dear."

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:18.360
For about the past three years I have been
preparing the actual original film material

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.200
for digitization.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.980
We are following the script that goes with
the film, like any other projectionist, and

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.660
we are creating, in essence, one version of
the film.

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:31.840
It's not a definitive version.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.600
They’re just doing a 2K scan of the material.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.600
The films, I hope, look like the 16-millimeter
films that they are.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.440
That you can see the grains swimming, that
you can see some scratches once in a while,

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.320
you will see dirt go by, there's splices because
there was...

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.410
you know, the film was damaged at some point,
we lost some frames.

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:49.950
All that's going to be in there, there's no...

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:53.560
you know, we're not tweaking anything so that
it looks pretty.

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.710
We were the projectionists for this version.

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:00.340
And that's what we'll be showing for at least
for the time being, until we think

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:06.910
about the philosophical issues involved and,
like, how to bring it back to a non-standard

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.200
standard version.

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.660
So those are my thoughts on "The Chelsea Girls" and Andy Warhol as a filmmaker.
