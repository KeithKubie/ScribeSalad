00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:12.000
From the company that owns a monopoly on teenage
girl fantasies

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.970
comes the only film about starving children
with it’s own delicious sandwich tie-in!

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.800
Subway: be bold, eat fresh!

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.830
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.080
You’ve seen the first Hunger Games,

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.130
now, prepare for the way better follow-up
to the thinking girl's Twilight

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:35.970
and watch as this good movie gets hailed as
great because everyone wants to be BFF’s

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:36.970
with Jennifer Lawrence.

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.030
"I'm sorry, I did a shot before I --"

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.079
God, she’s just so down to Earth.

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:49.320
Return to Panem, where it’s taken 75 years
for people to get a little bit upset about

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.710
the annual child murdering competition

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.340
and reunite with Katniss.

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:59.320
Watch as this global role model and feminist
icon spends the entire movie

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.000
getting saved by boys,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.000
"Duck!"

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.880
"Whoa whoa whoa!"

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.490
"Get out of my way!"

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:08.490
complaining,

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.670
"I don't want anyone looking to me."

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.270
"I'm really not in the mood for a lecture."

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.770
"So far, I'm not overwhelmed by our choices."

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.209
"I should have just eaten the berries in the
arena and died like I was supposed to."

00:01:19.209 --> 00:01:20.209
being antisocial,

00:01:20.209 --> 00:01:21.880
"These tributes are crazy."

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.510
"God, does anybody actually believe this?"

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.950
"You son of a bitch!"

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.869
"You are a strangely dislikeable person."

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.990
"I've never been very good at friends."

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.359
and getting manipulated to the point where
her actions have no effect on the plot at

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:38.359
all.

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:39.490
"You have been our mission from the beginning."

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.929
"Better for you to know nothing at all."

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:46.460
Follow Katniss as she must once again choose
between Gale, a total hunk

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:47.810
"Hey, Kat-nip."

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.109
or Peeta, a total burden to everyone around
him.

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:54.950
Whether he’s drowning,

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:55.950
falling,

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:56.950
"Peeta!"

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.659
"I can't carry him!"

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.420
wandering into a forcefield,

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.749
"Peeta no!"

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:09.869
or wandering into a pack of killer monkeys,

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.560
nothing will stop Peeta on his neverending
quest to escape from the friend-zone.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.670
"What's your favorite color?"

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.510
"Now you've stepped over the line."

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.720
"Seriously, though, what is it?"

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.010
"For you."

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.300
"Thank you."

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.230
"Nobody needs me."

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.510
"I do."

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.090
Holy sh*t, it worked!

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.250
Not bad, cake boss, not bad.

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.670
Join Peeta and Katniss as they spend 12 days
riding around on a train,

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.360
"You never get off this train!"

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.780
even though flying hovercrafts exist in the
same movie.

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.320
Then gear up for Hunger Games All Stars: Rumble
in the Jungle.

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.980
Full of new twists like...

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.070
older people,

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:52.510
fog herpes,

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.390
and the rotating danger zones from Battle
Royale.

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.720
Meet new competitors like...

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.500
Joanna, a hottie who does her best to make
Katniss jealous,

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.570
Finnick, a hottie who does his best to make
Katniss jealous,

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:11.700
and a bunch of new random tributes who die
before you even bother to learn their silly

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:12.700
names.

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:13.980
"Not a threat."

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.170
So experience a film that’s ultimately just
a commercial for the next film...

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.780
"This is the revolution, and you are the Mocking
Jay."

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.870
which will ultimately just be a commercial
for the next film...

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:30.350
because now every successful franchise has
to drag things out as long as possible.

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:31.350
OK!

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.640
We’ll go see the sequels!

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.280
Don’t hurt us!

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.280

The Hunger Games: Catching Fire.

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:05.770
Now THAT’S how Buttercup is supposed to
look.

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:08.820
Was that so hard, guys?

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:09.940
