will be what you need to implement that

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040
will be what you need to implement that
 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.860
will be what you need to implement that
are the key equations you need in order

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870
are the key equations you need in order
 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.680
are the key equations you need in order
to implement gradient descent for

logistic regression but in this video I
 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.529
logistic regression but in this video I
want to do this computation using the

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:20.539
want to do this computation using the
 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:23.240
want to do this computation using the
computation graph I have to admit using

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250
computation graph I have to admit using
 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.279

the computation graph is a little bit of

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289
the computation graph is a little bit of
 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.500
the computation graph is a little bit of
an overkill for deriving gradient

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510
an overkill for deriving gradient
 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.419
an overkill for deriving gradient
descent for logistic regression but I

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429
descent for logistic regression but I
 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.189
descent for logistic regression but I
want to start explaining things this way

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199
want to start explaining things this way
 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.590

to get you familiar with these ideas so

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600
to get you familiar with these ideas so
 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.819
to get you familiar with these ideas so
that hopefully you'll make a bit more

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829
that hopefully you'll make a bit more
 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.889
that hopefully you'll make a bit more
sense when we talk about full fledged

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899

descent for logistic regression to recap

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969
descent for logistic regression to recap
 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.110
descent for logistic regression to recap
we had set up logistic regression as

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120
we had set up logistic regression as
 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.350
we had set up logistic regression as
follows your predictions y hat is

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360
follows your predictions y hat is
 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.819
follows your predictions y hat is
defined as follows where Z is that and

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829
defined as follows where Z is that and
 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.750
defined as follows where Z is that and
if we focus on just one example for now

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760
if we focus on just one example for now
 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.990
if we focus on just one example for now
then the loss or respect to that one

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000
then the loss or respect to that one
 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.990
then the loss or respect to that one
example is defined as follows where a is

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000
example is defined as follows where a is
 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.240
example is defined as follows where a is
the output of the just regression and Y

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250
the output of the just regression and Y
 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.359
the output of the just regression and Y
is the ground truth label so let's write

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369
is the ground truth label so let's write
 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.539
is the ground truth label so let's write
this out as a computation graph and for

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549
this out as a computation graph and for
 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.480
this out as a computation graph and for
this example let's say we have only two

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490
this example let's say we have only two
 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.890
this example let's say we have only two
features x1 and x2 so in order to

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900
features x1 and x2 so in order to
 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.020
features x1 and x2 so in order to
compute Z we'll need to input w1 w2 and

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030
compute Z we'll need to input w1 w2 and
 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.810
compute Z we'll need to input w1 w2 and
B in addition to the feature values x1

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820
B in addition to the feature values x1
 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.749
B in addition to the feature values x1
x2 so these things in a computation

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759
x2 so these things in a computation
 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.620
x2 so these things in a computation
graph get used to compute Z which is w1

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630
graph get used to compute Z which is w1
 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:44.060
graph get used to compute Z which is w1
x1 plus w2 x2 plus B draw rectangle box

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070
x1 plus w2 x2 plus B draw rectangle box
 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.410
x1 plus w2 x2 plus B draw rectangle box
around that and then we compute Y hat or

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420
around that and then we compute Y hat or
 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.969
around that and then we compute Y hat or
a equals Sigma of Z that's the next step

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979
a equals Sigma of Z that's the next step
 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.609
a equals Sigma of Z that's the next step
in a computation Draft and then finally

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619
in a computation Draft and then finally
 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.260
in a computation Draft and then finally
we compute L a Y and I won't copy the

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270
we compute L a Y and I won't copy the
 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.410
we compute L a Y and I won't copy the
formula again so in logistic regression

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420
formula again so in logistic regression
 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.870
formula again so in logistic regression
what we want to do is to modify the

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880
what we want to do is to modify the
 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.969
what we want to do is to modify the
parameters W and B in order to reduce

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979
parameters W and B in order to reduce
 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.650
parameters W and B in order to reduce
this loss

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660
this loss
 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.990
this loss
we've described before propagation steps

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000
we've described before propagation steps
 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.270
we've described before propagation steps
of how you actually compute the loss on

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280
of how you actually compute the loss on
 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.970
of how you actually compute the loss on
a single training example now let's talk

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980
a single training example now let's talk
 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.830
a single training example now let's talk
about how you can go backwards to talk

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840
about how you can go backwards to talk
 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.320
about how you can go backwards to talk
to compute the derivatives here's the

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330
to compute the derivatives here's the
 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:25.730

cleaned up version of the diagram
 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.010
cleaned up version of the diagram
because what we want to do is compute

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020
because what we want to do is compute
 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.740
because what we want to do is compute

first thing we want to do we're going

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670
first thing we want to do we're going
 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.180
first thing we want to do we're going
backwards is to compute the derivative

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190
backwards is to compute the derivative
 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.720
backwards is to compute the derivative
of this loss with respect to the script

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730
of this loss with respect to the script
 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.330
of this loss with respect to the script
over there with respect to this variable

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340
over there with respect to this variable
 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.120
over there with respect to this variable
a and so in the code you know you just

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130
a and so in the code you know you just
 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.440
a and so in the code you know you just
use da right to denote this um variable

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450
use da right to denote this um variable
 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.410
use da right to denote this um variable
and it turns out that if you often

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420
and it turns out that if you often
 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.690
and it turns out that if you often
believe of calculus you can show that

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700
believe of calculus you can show that
 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.250
believe of calculus you can show that
this ends up being negative Y over a

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260
this ends up being negative Y over a
 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.630
this ends up being negative Y over a
plus one minus y over one minus a and

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640
plus one minus y over one minus a and
 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.160
plus one minus y over one minus a and
the way you do that is you take the

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170
the way you do that is you take the
 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.620
the way you do that is you take the
formula for the loss and if you have a

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630
formula for the loss and if you have a
 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.540

in calculus if you're not explain

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420
in calculus if you're not explain
 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.000
in calculus if you're not explain
calculus don't worry about it but it

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010
calculus don't worry about it but it
 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.750
calculus don't worry about it but it
turns out that this right DL DZ this can

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760
turns out that this right DL DZ this can
 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.980
turns out that this right DL DZ this can
be expressed as DL da time

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990
be expressed as DL da time
 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.809
be expressed as DL da time
da DZ um and it turns out that da DZ

00:04:29.809 --> 00:04:29.819
da DZ um and it turns out that da DZ
 

00:04:29.819 --> 00:04:33.439
da DZ um and it turns out that da DZ
this turns out to be a times 1 minus a

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:33.449
this turns out to be a times 1 minus a
 

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:36.800
this turns out to be a times 1 minus a
and D l da we are previously worked out

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810
and D l da we are previously worked out
 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.749
and D l da we are previously worked out
over here and so if you take these two

00:04:38.749 --> 00:04:38.759
over here and so if you take these two
 

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:41.930
over here and so if you take these two
quantities you know DL da which is this

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940
quantities you know DL da which is this
 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.330
quantities you know DL da which is this
term together with da DZ which is this

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340
term together with da DZ which is this
 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.249
term together with da DZ which is this
term and just take these two things and

00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:46.259
term and just take these two things and
 

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:48.879
term and just take these two things and
multiply them you can show that you the

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:48.889
multiply them you can show that you the
 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:52.040
multiply them you can show that you the
equation simplifies the a minus y so

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050
equation simplifies the a minus y so
 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:53.779
equation simplifies the a minus y so
that's how you derive it and this is

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:53.789
that's how you derive it and this is
 

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:55.999
that's how you derive it and this is
really the chain rule that I pre-cleared

00:04:55.999 --> 00:04:56.009
really the chain rule that I pre-cleared
 

00:04:56.009 --> 00:04:58.939
really the chain rule that I pre-cleared
you did to inform ok so feel free to go

00:04:58.939 --> 00:04:58.949
you did to inform ok so feel free to go
 

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:01.040
you did to inform ok so feel free to go
through that calculation yourself if you

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.050
through that calculation yourself if you
 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.080
through that calculation yourself if you
are knowledgeable calculus but if you

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090
are knowledgeable calculus but if you
 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:04.700
are knowledgeable calculus but if you
aren't all you need to know is that you

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710
aren't all you need to know is that you
 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.430
aren't all you need to know is that you
can compute DZ as a minus y and it

already done the calculus for you and
 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.180
already done the calculus for you and
then the final step in back propagation

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:11.190
then the final step in back propagation
 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:14.240
then the final step in back propagation
is to go back to compute how much you

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250
is to go back to compute how much you
 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.960
is to go back to compute how much you
need to change W and B so in particular

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970
need to change W and B so in particular
 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:21.140
need to change W and B so in particular
you can show that the derivative respect

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.150
you can show that the derivative respect
 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:27.080
you can show that the derivative respect
to w1 and in Co will call this DW 1 that

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:27.090
to w1 and in Co will call this DW 1 that
 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:31.189
to w1 and in Co will call this DW 1 that
this is equal to x1 times DZ

00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:31.199
this is equal to x1 times DZ
 

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:34.460
this is equal to x1 times DZ
um and then similarly DW 2 which is how

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:34.470
um and then similarly DW 2 which is how
 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:37.310
um and then similarly DW 2 which is how
much you want to change W 2 is X 2 times

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:37.320
much you want to change W 2 is X 2 times
 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:42.800
much you want to change W 2 is X 2 times
DZ and be excuse me DB is equal to DZ so

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:42.810
DZ and be excuse me DB is equal to DZ so
 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:45.080
DZ and be excuse me DB is equal to DZ so
if you want to do gradient descents with

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.090
if you want to do gradient descents with
 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:47.749
if you want to do gradient descents with
respect to just this one example what

00:05:47.749 --> 00:05:47.759
respect to just this one example what
 

00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:49.730
respect to just this one example what
you will do is the following you would

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740
you will do is the following you would
 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:53.060
you will do is the following you would
use this formula to compute DZ and then

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:53.070
use this formula to compute DZ and then
 

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:56.629
use this formula to compute DZ and then
use these formulas to compute DW 1 DW 2

00:05:56.629 --> 00:05:56.639
use these formulas to compute DW 1 DW 2
 

00:05:56.639 --> 00:06:00.110
use these formulas to compute DW 1 DW 2
and DB and then you perform these

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:00.120
and DB and then you perform these
 

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:04.249
and DB and then you perform these
updates w1 gets updated w1 - learning

00:06:04.249 --> 00:06:04.259
updates w1 gets updated w1 - learning
 

00:06:04.259 --> 00:06:08.420

rate alpha times D w1 w2 gets updated
similarly and B gets set as B - the

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:12.150
similarly and B gets set as B - the
 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:14.779
similarly and B gets set as B - the
learning rate times DB and so this will

00:06:14.779 --> 00:06:14.789
learning rate times DB and so this will
 

00:06:14.789 --> 00:06:16.969
learning rate times DB and so this will
be one step of grade with respect to a

00:06:16.969 --> 00:06:16.979
be one step of grade with respect to a
 

00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:19.790
be one step of grade with respect to a
