00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:01.972
Great job on unit 3!

00:00:01.972 --> 00:00:04.050
Understanding these fundamental parallel primitives

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:07.716
opens the door to mapping many interesting tasks to the GPU,

00:00:07.716 --> 00:00:10.082
and it also gives you the foundation for the next unit,

00:00:10.082 --> 00:00:13.479
where we're going to look at sort and applications of scan.

00:00:13.479 --> 00:00:15.752
You'll use today's topics in the problem set

00:00:15.752 --> 00:00:19.356
where you will implement a high dynamic range, HDR, imaging algorithm

00:00:19.356 --> 00:00:24.619
that you can use to better represent the wide range of intensities in real scenes.
