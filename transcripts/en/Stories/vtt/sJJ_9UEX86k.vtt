00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.240
INTERVIEWER 1: Unknown
to the rest of the world,

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:04.530
there is a violent turf
war happening in Chile.

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:06.690
To truly understand it,
you have to go all the way

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.350
back to the 1500s, to the
start of the Arauca War.

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:12.540
When colonial Spaniards
began to try and take

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.860
control of Araucania, a
region about 450 miles south

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.880
of Santiago, then occupied by
numerous indigenous peoples,

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.890
including the Mapuche.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.940
It was a land battle that
lasted for over 280 years,

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.100
and in the end, the
Chilean military

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.282
succeeded in taking Araucania.

00:00:31.282 --> 00:00:32.740
SUBJECT 2: And then
the government,

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.730
after occupying
these places, they

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.390
started to open up
offices in Europe,

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.900
so they could bring settlers
to this part of Chile.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.070
They would give away land,
so these people from Germany,

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.310
from Switzerland, came,
and they were given

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:51.990
territory, free territory.

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:54.956
All of this led to the
situation that we have now.

00:00:54.956 --> 00:00:57.330
INTERVIEWER 1: This is Nicolas
Rios, a Chilean journalist

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:01.020
covering the Mapuche story,
who I met up with in Santiago.

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.190
He told me that around
600,000 Mapuche still live

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.620
in the forested
region of Araucania,

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.200
alongside small landowners
who are descendants

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.120
of European settlers.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.730
But since the 1980s,
commercial logging companies

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:16.380
have also moved into the area.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.340
And today, forestry is
Chile's second largest export,

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.264
supplying wood to countries
like Argentina, Japan,

00:01:23.264 --> 00:01:24.180
and the United States.

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.360
However, in the
process of growth,

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.180
the industry has wiped away
much of the native forest

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.100
that the Mapuche call home.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.860
SUBJECT 2: On one hand,
you have the Mapuches

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.520
claiming, or reclaiming,
the property of this land.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.130
And on the other hand,
you have relatives

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.020
of those European settlers.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.250
All these people claiming
property of the land,

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.452
so that's when the
clashes started to happen.

00:01:50.452 --> 00:01:52.410
INTERVIEWER 1: Clashes
that turned more violent

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.100
after General Pinochet
seceded power in 1990.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.600
SUBJECT 2: Before 1990,
there was a very strong hand

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.370
dictatorship here in Chile.

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:04.980
So nobody, really
nobody in the country

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:11.327
was able to form an organization
to fight for something.

00:02:11.327 --> 00:02:13.410
INTERVIEWER 1: It was clear
after meeting Nicholas

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.380
that if I was really going to
understand what was going on,

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.540
I had to travel to Araucania.

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.740
Even though this
town's so small,

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.970
I see an armored vehicle
on every one of the corners

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:32.960
around.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.690
It turns out that state
armored vehicles are actually

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.400
pretty common around here.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.950
In the early 2000s,
the Chilean government

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.730
implemented a Pinochet
era anti-terrorist law.

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.700
A move that's been criticized
as an effort to strong arm

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.670
Mapuche into ceasing
their protests.

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.370
According to a UN report,
the Chilean police

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.270
were guilty of quote "A
systemic use of excessive force"

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:58.880
with reputed accounts
of brutality,

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.270
raiding homes, and detaining
Mapuche without charge.

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:03.380
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:03:16.645 --> 00:03:18.770
INTERVIEWER 1: The Chilean
government has, in fact,

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:21.230
promised to buy back
and transfer the land

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.190
titles to the Mapuche.

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.620
However, according to
reports, these reparations

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.770
have been offered piecemeal and
are at an incredibly slow rate,

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:33.936
which is why many have taken
the law into their own hands.

00:03:33.936 --> 00:03:44.271
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:03:44.271 --> 00:03:46.520
INTERVIEWER 1: In the nearby
community of [INAUDIBLE],

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.320
that's exactly what happened.

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.090
Here, Mapuche have
started building illegally

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.070
in an attempt to lay claim
to their ancestral land.

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:58.460
But as we found out, this
strategy can backfire.

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:00.470
When we met this
Mapuche woman she

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.260
told us how the police
evicted her from land

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:04.715
that she'd built on illegally.

00:04:04.715 --> 00:04:31.175
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:04:31.175 --> 00:04:36.500
INTERVIEWER 1: We just visited
a house that was burned down.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:41.840
It feels kind of like
the Wild West out here.

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.660
You get the sense that these
kinds of land rights issues

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:48.950
are really up to the people
who have the most money.

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:51.050
While in [INAUDIBLE], we
couldn't ignore the fact

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:54.170
that the Mapuche aren't the
only victims in this conflict.

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:58.490
Small landowners, like Sonia
Villobos, also live in fear.

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:00.410
As a descendant of
European settlers

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:03.020
who's been here for
generations, she

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.270
is distressed that some
Mapuche have threatened

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:06.380
to take her land away.

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:07.850
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:05:23.667 --> 00:05:26.000
INTERVIEWER 1: It was an
interesting experience spending

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.900
a day with both a Chilean family
as well as a Mapuche family,

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:33.950
both who claim to have rights
to the same piece of land.

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:36.590
It's difficult to see how
this conflict is going

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:39.080
to be resolved, and
ultimately, it's

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:43.640
just a microcosm for land rights
issues between the Mapuche

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:46.100
people and the government
that had existed

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:48.160
for the past few hundred years.

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.810
SUBJECT 2: They are all victims,
the settlers are victims,

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:55.100
the Mapuche are victims, and
small farmers are victims.

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:57.200
They are all victims
here because of what

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:01.110
the state of Chile
did 120 years ago.

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:05.150
This is a situation
that has to be handled,

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:06.740
that needs a solution.

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:10.320
And I think that, if it
doesn't get a solution,

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:14.690
things could escalate
into a worse scenario

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:17.187
than we have now.

00:06:17.187 --> 00:06:19.520

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:22.410
stories, and be sure to check
out this next episode, where

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:24.390
I investigate the
unexpected reason

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:27.060
why wild pigs are
being hunted in Hawaii,

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:30.260
in order to conserve
coral reefs.
