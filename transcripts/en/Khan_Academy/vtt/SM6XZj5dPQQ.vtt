00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.523
- [Voiceover] The amount
of carbon dioxide, CO2,

00:00:02.523 --> 00:00:04.345
in the atmosphere increases rapidly

00:00:04.345 --> 00:00:06.980
as we continue to rely on fossil fuels.

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:09.639
The relationship between
the elapsed time, t,

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:11.624
in decades, let me highlight that,

00:00:11.624 --> 00:00:13.667
because that's not a typical unit,

00:00:13.667 --> 00:00:17.413
but, in decades, since CO2
levels were first measured,

00:00:17.413 --> 00:00:20.297
and the total amount of
CO2 in the atmosphere,

00:00:20.425 --> 00:00:24.999
so the amount of CO2,
A, of sub decade of (t),

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:26.798
in parts per million, is modeled

00:00:26.798 --> 00:00:28.342
by the following function.

00:00:28.342 --> 00:00:30.524
So, the amount of CO2 as a function

00:00:30.524 --> 00:00:32.277
of how many decades have passed

00:00:32.277 --> 00:00:34.564
is going to be this, so t is in decades

00:00:34.564 --> 00:00:37.258
in this model right over here.

00:00:37.258 --> 00:00:38.627
Complete the following sentence

00:00:38.627 --> 00:00:41.065
about the yearly rate of change,

00:00:41.495 --> 00:00:44.989
the yearly rate of change in the amount

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:46.461
of CO2 in the atmosphere.

00:00:46.461 --> 00:00:48.667
Round your answer to two decimal places.

00:00:48.667 --> 00:00:50.108
Every year, the amount of CO2

00:00:50.108 --> 00:00:52.874
in the atmosphere
increases by a factor of?

00:00:52.874 --> 00:00:55.043
If they said every decade, well,

00:00:55.043 --> 00:00:56.157
this would be pretty straightforward.

00:00:56.157 --> 00:00:59.503
Every decade, you increase t
by one, and so you're going

00:00:59.503 --> 00:01:01.988
to multiply by 1.06 again.

00:01:01.988 --> 00:01:05.865
So every decade, you
increase by a factor of 1.06.

00:01:05.865 --> 00:01:07.885
But what about every year?

00:01:07.885 --> 00:01:09.824
Now, I always find it
helpful to make a bit

00:01:09.824 --> 00:01:13.651
of a table, just so we can
really digest things properly.

00:01:14.061 --> 00:01:17.265
So I'll say t, and I'll say A of t.

00:01:17.725 --> 00:01:19.668
So, when t is equal to zero,

00:01:19.668 --> 00:01:21.503
so at the beginning of our study,

00:01:21.503 --> 00:01:24.521
well, 1.06 to the zeroth
power is just going to be one,

00:01:24.521 --> 00:01:27.922
you have 315 parts per million.

00:01:28.742 --> 00:01:30.767
So, what's a year later?

00:01:30.767 --> 00:01:33.181
So, a year later is going
to be a tenth of a decade.

00:01:33.181 --> 00:01:35.039
Remember, t is in decades.

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:37.397
So a year later is

00:01:37.397 --> 00:01:40.577
0.1 of a decade.

00:01:40.577 --> 00:01:42.817
So, 0.1 of a decade later,

00:01:42.817 --> 00:01:46.845
what is going to be the
amount of carbon we have?

00:01:46.845 --> 00:01:49.102
Well, it's going to be 315

00:01:49.802 --> 00:01:53.962
times 1.06

00:01:53.962 --> 00:01:58.946
to the 0.1 power.

00:01:59.556 --> 00:02:01.600
And what is that going to be?

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.666
Let's see, if we...

00:02:03.666 --> 00:02:08.034
so 1.06 to the,

00:02:08.774 --> 00:02:10.494
so to the

00:02:11.824 --> 00:02:15.634
0.1 power,

00:02:15.634 --> 00:02:17.737
I didn't have to actually
use the parentheses there,

00:02:17.737 --> 00:02:22.191
is equal to 1.0058,

00:02:22.191 --> 00:02:23.681
I'll just take it with that.

00:02:23.681 --> 00:02:26.525
1.0058.

00:02:27.485 --> 00:02:30.809
So this is the same thing as 3.5

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:34.839
times 1.0058.

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:36.713
And I should say approximately equal to,

00:02:36.713 --> 00:02:38.343
I did a little bit of rounding there.

00:02:38.343 --> 00:02:40.455
So, after another year,
so now now we're at

00:02:40.455 --> 00:02:43.903
t equals 0.2, we're at
two-tenths of a decade.

00:02:43.903 --> 00:02:44.983
Where're we going to be?

00:02:44.983 --> 00:02:49.696
We're going to be at 3.5 times 1.06

00:02:50.286 --> 00:02:53.562
to the 0.2, which is the same thing

00:02:53.562 --> 00:02:56.569
as 3.5

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:59.649
times 1.06

00:02:59.649 --> 00:03:01.969
to the 0.1,

00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:05.275
and then that raised to the second power.

00:03:05.275 --> 00:03:07.946
So we're going to multiply by this 1.06

00:03:07.946 --> 00:03:10.720
to the one-tenth power again,

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.062
or we're going to multiply
by 1.0058 a second time.

00:03:15.062 --> 00:03:16.141
Another way to think about it,

00:03:16.141 --> 00:03:18.672
if we wanted to reformulate this model

00:03:18.672 --> 00:03:23.281
in terms of years, so per year of t,

00:03:23.281 --> 00:03:26.938
it's going to be 315
and now our common ratio

00:03:26.938 --> 00:03:31.175
wouldn't be 1.06, it would
be 1.06 to the .1 power,

00:03:31.175 --> 00:03:35.841
or 1.0058,

00:03:36.271 --> 00:03:37.601
and then we would raise that.

00:03:37.601 --> 00:03:39.580
Now t would be in years now.

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.379
Here, it is in decades.

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:42.687
And I can say approximately,

00:03:42.687 --> 00:03:44.978
since this is rounded a little bit.

00:03:44.978 --> 00:03:46.696
And so, every year, the amount of CO2

00:03:46.696 --> 00:03:48.914
in the atmosphere
increases by a factor of,

00:03:48.914 --> 00:03:53.418
I could say 1.06 to the 0.1
power, but if I'm rounding

00:03:53.418 --> 00:03:56.111
my answer to two decimal places,

00:03:56.111 --> 00:03:58.713
the, well, we're going to increase

00:03:58.713 --> 00:04:03.693
by 1.0058,

00:04:03.693 --> 00:04:07.093
in fact, they should, the
increase is by a factor of,

00:04:07.093 --> 00:04:09.496
they should, I'm guessing they want more

00:04:09.496 --> 00:04:11.830
than two decimal places.

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:15.452
Well, anyway, this is arguably,
this right over here is

00:04:15.452 --> 00:04:17.170
five significant digits.

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:19.075
But anyway, I'll leave it there.
