00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.240
It took me a long time to realize this but my emotions aren't always that clear for people to see

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.419
As an introvert, I have one hell of a poker face

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.939
It's been like that ever since I was a kid

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.250
This has its advantages

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.770
But it's also pretty tough to deal with the times of course the people who really have a tough for the people around me

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:35.449
Why because they have no idea what I'm feeling at any given time?

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.380
This situation was always worse when I was pissed off

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.199
I couldn't understand for the life of me

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:44.599
why no one could see how frustrated I was

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.069
They would come up to me and talk to me when I quite obviously did not want to be talked to

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:53.239
Why the hell were they doing this were they just trying to mess with me?

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:57.499
Did they enjoy making me more and more furious until I went completely nuts

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.799
It took me a while to realize the truth

00:01:01.499 --> 00:01:04.129
They had no idea. I was mad in the first place

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.429
They just didn't see the signs to me these signs would have been super obvious for anyone to see but I guess

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.800
For most people they go unnoticed

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.289
Anyway, one sign that people would always miss was the fact that I was responding with one word

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.289
When someone would ask me how I was doing I would say

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.370
fine

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:24.800
Obviously, I was not fine

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.450
But for some reason they didn't understand that and they could see that I was giving them a one-word answer

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.450
so they would go away

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:36.679
I quickly learned that the best way to deal with someone who would piss me off was to pretend that everything was okay?

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.290
My logic was that if they thought I was happy they would leave me alone, and I wouldn't have to explain to them

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:43.890
Why I was pissed

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.560
That was just a conversation

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.620
I did not want to have the more I had to talk the more pissed

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:53.660
I would get giving a fake smile and walking away, and did my interaction with them right away

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.059
Of course that didn't always work. You can only pretend everything is okay for a while

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:04.459
If someone keeps doing something to piss you off, and you keep giving them a fake smile eventually all that

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.129
balls left inside of you is going to Explode

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:09.709
learned that the hard way and

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.110
Then of course people get all confused as to why I just blew up over the smallest thing

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.600
They really should have understood. I was pissed off at them when I refused to help the weirdest times

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.840
oh, what's that you have the answers to tomorrow's math test yep?

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.469
I don't need'em you want to perform CPR on me to stop me from dying

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:30.430
nope

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:37.379
Don't touch me I pretty much wanted nothing to do with the people that had pissed me off even if they had something

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.969
I really needed I wanted no interaction with them whatsoever. No matter what?

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:44.250
When I was seriously pissed off

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:50.610
I would just shut down emotionally I pretty much answered every question with whatever on the outside

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:56.700
It looked like I was just tired or bored, but on the inside there was a furious rage building up inside of me

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.389
I don't know why I expected them to see through this wall of apathy

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.680
But I did if the people that pissed me off became truly unbearable

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.629
I would just bury myself in a book I would suddenly become very interested in whatever

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.430
I was reading just so I didn't have to talk to them it worked, but they still had no idea

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.430
I was pissed off at them

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:22.589
They probably knew something was wrong when I was being more social with their cat than I was with them I

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.909
Would give all my attention to their pet and completely ignore them I

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:31.920
Still get pissed off of evil, but I've learned to express my emotions

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.800
well most of the time anyway and

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:40.350
Most of the time I've learned that the best thing to do when you're pissed off is to get some alone Time I

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:43.529
Cool down ponder how I'm going to kill someone

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:51.990
Realize I don't actually hate them that much and then eventually eventually I realize that I should probably just forgive them

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.170
most of the time that is.
