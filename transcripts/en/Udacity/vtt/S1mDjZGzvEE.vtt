00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
For the first doctor, we have three data points.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Data point one, well, it's observed value was 2.00 and the mean was 2.00.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
It’s actually a distance of 0 from the mean.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
The absolute deviation of this number, this observation, is 0.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:24.000
What about this guy, 1.2 meters? Well, 1.2 - 2 is equal to 0.8, -0.8.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
But since I don't really care whether they're overestimating or underestimating,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I’m going to always make these numbers positive which I do by taking the absolute value.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
So, just call that + 0.8. This third measurement of 2.8, I get again a deviation of 0.8.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Now, for my three measurements, I have deviation of 0, 0.8, and 0.8.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
That’s the deviation part. What about the average?

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Well, you know how to do an average, you take the sum, 0 + 0.8 + 0.8 gives me 1.6

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and we divide by a number of data points, so 1.6/3 is equal to about 0.53.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
So, the average deviation for this first doctor was 0.53 and that unit there is meters.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
We interpret this by saying when this doctor makes a measurement,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
I can only say with confidence that she's probably within 0.53 meters

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
but even then that's not always true.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
In fact, into these measurements, she was outside of that range.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
The way we would write this is by saying the green-haired doctor measured

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000
my height to be 2.00 meters plus or minus 0.53 meters.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Now, normal height within half a meter is not so helpful,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
so let’s see what the purple-haired doctor said.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Can you tell me how the purple-haired doctor would state my height

00:01:36.000 --> 99:59:59.000
including the average and the average deviation? Enter your answer here.
