00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.340
Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic. I remember it so you don't have to.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.500
It's no secret that the Dr. Seuss films have had a bit of a checkered past.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:20.420
Cat in the Hat: Dirty hoe!

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.240
Grinch: Kiss it, Whoville! Nyoiyoiyoiyoiyoiyoi!

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.660
Once-Ler: ♫ How ba-a-a-ad can I be? ♫

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.400
NC: Pretty goddamn bad, apparently.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.400
But the one film that everyone agrees is

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.980
gooooooooooo...

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.400
the least bad is Horton Hears A Who.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.100
Starring Jim Carrey and Steve Carell (because that worked so great before),

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.170
the film was based on the hit book that led to an underperforming box-office.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.100
Overtime, though it's gotten the reputation as the closest thing to a good Dr. Seuss movie we ever got.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.180
Well I'm here to ask: Is it really?

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.740
I mean, granted we all know Seuss needs more anime references, emo kids and...

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.620
...whatever the hell this is, but is it good enough to count as a decent movie or is it just...

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:04.520
ehhgh, the least painful?

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:09.090
Well, I think it's time to look over what was ironically overlooked; a film about being overlooked.

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.080
So let's look it over.

00:01:10.525 --> 00:01:13.060
This is my review of Horton Hears a Who.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.920
It starts off pretty enough with a colourful and creative environment,

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.420
as Jim Carrey - thank God not covered in makeup to look like the character at this time -

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.020
...is teaching a class of ugly about the various animals in the forest.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.700
Horton: The leaf bug!

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.880
Horton: Noo, they're on me!! [screams]

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.740
[chaos]

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.920
Yeah...it's definitely movement your kid should like that.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.280
Then a sour kangaroo - played by Carol Burnett - looks over the shenanigans Horton is causing.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.880
Rudy: Why can't I play with the other kids mom?

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.560
Kangaroo: The jungle is no
place to act like a wild animal.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.200
She'll learn to lighten up and he'll be happy-- can we just skip that 1/3 of the movie now?

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.380
But a tiny speck flies by and Horton hears a sound from it.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.920
The animation cleverly goes hand-drawn to show Horton's imagination mimicking Seuss's original style,

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.260
but unfortunately the rest of the style seems to like action and references,

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.800
for the sake of there just being action and references.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.675
Horton: I love the smell of bananas in the morning!

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.760
[deeply] I feel the diplomatic process is beginning to break down.

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:15.280
It's just like Robin Williams in Aladdin, except he came in halfway through the film,

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.420
so we could get to know the characters, and this hasn't even been 9 minutes yet.

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:24.420
Horton catches the speck on a flower but the kangaroo is [snooty] not amused. No, really, she sounds like that.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.260
Kangaroo: Absurd! There aren't people that small.

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:34.061
Horton: What if there was someone WAAAAY OUT THERE... looking down on our world right now?

00:02:34.061 --> 00:02:36.140
Kanagroo: There is nothing
on that speck!

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.040
[as Kangaroo] As an atheist, it's my job to be offended by that...

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.040
and then offended by anyone else being offended by anything.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.260
But sure enough, there's a whole town of people on that speck, filled with people called the Whos.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.160
Steve Carell plays the mayor named...

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.780
Narrator: The man named Mc[?]

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:51.466
Wait, what?

00:02:51.466 --> 00:02:52.320
Narrator: Mc[?]

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.780
...Wait, what?

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:54.480
Narrator: Mc[?]

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.320
McGod?

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.040
Narrator: Mc[?]

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.880
McGaug?

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:57.780
Narrator: Mc[?]

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.780
Whatever; you just call him that to rhyme with 'odd'.

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.554
Narrator: He was devoted and fair and a little bit odd.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.700
Apparently Who sperm come out of shotgun barrel testicles,

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.460
because the mayor has 96 daughters, and I'm gonna take a wild guess and say,

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.140
his wife would not look that good after so many births.

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.320
I think this will be a more fitting representation.

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.440
There is however one boy in the group;

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.480
he's the oldest named Jo-Jo, who the mayor is prepping to take over as mayor.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.880
But he never speaks because, get this:

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:29.560
Narrator: And why didn't he speak? Well I think the lad was afraid if he did, he might let down his dad.

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:37.780
Clearly you understand why many children also don't speak. You read a child psychology book Dr. Seuss!--

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.280
...'s people.

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.100
Meanwhile Horton comes across his friend, Seth Rogen.

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.740
Yeah, they named this character something else but listen to him.

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.700
Morton: That's awesome Horton, that
really helps.

00:03:47.703 --> 00:03:51.420
Even if I said the character's name all you would hear is Seth Rogen. Watch.

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.120
(really saying Morton) Seth Rogen. See?

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:57.060
He tells Horton to keep the speck to himself but Horton's students

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.040
(I think; the whole teacher thing never comes back with Horton)

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.880
accidentally get him to blurt it out.

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:07.413
However Horton's movements are causing big earthquakes in the Whos' world because...

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.420
all of this somehow had no impact!

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:13.680
However, this disturbs the mayor who suggests postponing their big Who Celebration.

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.400
They of course don't listen to him nearing the rejection Horton is going for as well,

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.320
but it seems the Whos just want to ignore the problem and spend their time on whospace.com.

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.320
Yeah, you see why topical jokes don't always work, Seuss movies?

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:29.400
Horton and the mayor finally hear each other and they try to explain who/what/who they are.

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:35.580
Horton: Your whole world fits on a flower in my world. It's pretty amazing.

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.740
[as Horton] And if you don't want me to go astronaut from Twilight Zone on your ass, you'll...

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.840
ehh, that sounds like fun. (slap x9)

00:04:44.856 --> 00:04:50.110
Realizing the danger they could be in, the mayor asks Horton to locate them a safer spot to be placed.

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.100
Horton decides to put them at the top of a mountain because...

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:54.480
those are safe as hell...

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.480
but he decides to do it once again through hand-drawn animation.

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.000
Oh cool, you mean like in Seuss's original style like what you did before?

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.880
Horton: [yelling]

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.200
Or if South Park just made fun of anime at the time I guess we can, too.

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.780
Horton: It is clear that you are no match for my techniq

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.220
Clover: Horton's the greatest hero of them all, haaa!!!

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:19.200
Horton, Morton, GO!

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:22.000
I think this calls for a facepalm WITH a facepalm!

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.040
Pikachu Morton: You are fast Horton but the kangaroo has monkeys!

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:29.420
I will make monkeys of these monkeys. It is their destiny, HAA!!

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:31.620
Horton: [yelling]

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:36.220
Where does an elephant in Dr. Seuss even watch anime? Is there a Crunchy Rhyme?

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.100
Pikachu Morton: But Mount Nool is that way!

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:40.420
Horton: ha ha ha

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:41.780
Oh, my God, STOP!

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.320
Thank you please never anything again!

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:48.580
Finally, we can get the story back on track!

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:51.020
Katie: haaaaaaa

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:57.000
Do you need a break? I need a break. Here's a break.

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:19.780
So Horton crosses a shaky bridge to get to the mountain, as once again,

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:23.480
Horton's movements seem to only affect the environment around the mayor.

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:32.020
You know Carol Burnett is in this, right? She won't like that we're ripping her off!

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:35.240
He makes it across the bridge and seems to be very happy.

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:38.880
Horton: I feel really good right now. Maybe it's my new sense of purpose.

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:45.720
You know, for a new sense of purpose, he sure does seem to do a lot of stuff with no purpose.

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:49.900
The kangaroo hates that Horton's imagination is spreading to the children,

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:52.660
so she decides to send a giant vulture after him.

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:55.100
Vlad: I would only do this for a price.

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:58.020
Vlad: This little kangaroo...

00:06:58.060 --> 00:06:58.680
Rudy: MOM!

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:01.800
Kangaroo: Quiet, Rudy. Mommy's thinking it over.

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:07.720
I'm so glad she's fighting for the children by debating whether or not she wants to sacrifice her own to a vulture.

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:09.100
Vlad: I'll take it...

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:11.560
Nonono, I'm not done! What the hell was up with that?!

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:15.060
That seemed bizarrely out of character!

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:18.600
She can be mean, but not give up her kid mean!

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:23.520
I mean, don't get me wrong, she still says no, but would it make more sense if she was insulted by that gesture?

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:27.100
She seems to just smile and walk away, forcing him to change his tune.

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:29.760
In fact even for HIS character it doesn't really fit!

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:34.480
He's constantly trying to look scary, but it's revealed he's not as threatening as he appears.

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:35.980
In fact, he's kind of a screw up.

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:41.420
So why was this pointless moment of two characters breaking character even in here?

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:45.640
It doesn't seem to add anything, it's not very funny and it doesn't match their personas!

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:47.680
I mean it makes about as much sense as having...

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:49.320
Horton: [yelling]

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:51.600
Ahh, that's right. They just like pointless shit.

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:52.440
Isn't that sad, Bill?

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:54.060
Bill: Mmm-hmm.

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:54.900
It's very sad.

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:58.960
The vulture attacks Horton, resulting in one of my favourite jokes in the movie.

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:03.140
Horton: [panting]

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:05.320
Horton: I just know he's gonna jump out somewhere...

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:05.820
Vlad: Hello.

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:06.660
Horton: [screaming]

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:10.400
I can't help it, I like it when the movie critiques its cliches before I do.

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:14.620
He manages to fight him off, but the town finally notices that shit is happening,

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:17.660
resulting in the politicians high up saying nothing is wrong.

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:18.800
You sure this is fiction?

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:21.940
The mayor finally tells everybody what's going on, though.

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:25.720
Mayor: A giant elephant in the sky!

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:27.860
Mayor: Don'tbotherlookinghe'sinvisible.

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:31.680
Lead politician, town: [laughing]

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:34.380
Would it sound better if it was a turtle that was written by Stephen King?

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:40.260
They obviously don't believe the mayor, and the flower is taken away before he can prove Horton is really around.

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:45.160
Like in the book, it's dropped into a gigantic field of flowers, making it impossible to find.

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:47.480
...And exactly like the book, he finds it.

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:49.220
I never said the book was flawless.

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:54.120
The Whos finally hear Horton which allows him to do his best John F Kennedy impersonation.

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:59.120
Horton (as JFK): And we will, uh, put a speck on Mount Nool before the end of this, uh, decade.

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:04.240
There's a JFK in Dr. Seuss too? You know what, if there's a Who Christ, why am I questioning anything?

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:08.400
The kangaroo finds out, though and tries to rally everybody behind her.

00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:12.700
Morton: This is Horton we're talking about! You all know him, he wouldn't hurt a fly!

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:16.260
Morton: ...Except for that fly city he sat on but he didn't do that on purpose.

00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:20.440
Huh, so in this version Horton already killed a town of tiny living things...

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:28.180
The crowd rushes towards Horton to take the speck away from him, so all the Whos try to scream to be heard.

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:33.340
This leads to a musically and visually creative climax resulting in all the various noises they can make.

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:37.820
[NOISE!!]

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:44.280
Sure enough, Jo-Jo just HAPPENED to create a device in his off time to make the loudest noise in town...

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:44.820
Yeah, sure.

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:49.960
And Jo-Jo, of course, sounds off the final sound, speaking for the first time breaking the...

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:51.820
sound barrier... I don't know.

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:57.580
But the animals finally hear it, and the Kangaroo's son saves them and brings the flower back to Horton.

00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:00.560
Town: [cheering]

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:02.340
Punk guy: YEAH!!

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:05.700
Now there's punk rock in Dr. Seuss too-- I don't care.

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:09.020
Horton apparently is nice enough to even forgive the kangaroo.

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:19.040
[as Kangaroo] It's the least I can do for attempting mass genocide.

00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:21.940
Jo-Jo: What are we gonna do without you, Horton?

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:23.260
Horton: I'll always be around...

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:26.920
Horton [singing]: And even as I wonder...

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:30.260
Oh, and in the last five minutes we decided to become a musical because our

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.480
identity is not strong enough to say we shouldn't!

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:37.060
We zoom out and see a whole universe of beautiful specks.

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:41.880
...And this butt ugly thing. What do you know what's the joke with that? Don't tell me. I don't want to see it again.

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:45.560
Horton Hears A Who, I hear a middle-of-the-road shrug.

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:53.020
The bad stuff isn't nearly as bad as the other Seuss films and once in a while there is a funny and/or creative moment.

00:10:53.020 --> 00:11:00.040
But it tries too hard to hit too many demographics, resulting in a weak experience, but not necessarily a bad one.

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:03.300
It's not painful, it's just kind of confused.

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:08.430
You can feel the pressure from studios, producers and [?] trying to make this something distinct,

00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:11.400
and instead turning out something kind of underwhelming.

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:15.700
Still, I think kids can watch it, fine, there's no real bad lessons in it,

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:17.920
at least if you don't think TOO hard about them.

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:21.560
I guess in hindsight it is the best Dr. Seuss movie ever made,

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:24.920
but given his other films, that's not exactly a high bar.

00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:29.000
It is what it is; a middle-of-the-road flick. And compared to the other Seuss films,

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:30.940
I'll gladly take that any day.

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:37.040
I'm the Nostalgia Critic, I remember it so you don't have to.

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:41.200
Katie: SIIIGH...
