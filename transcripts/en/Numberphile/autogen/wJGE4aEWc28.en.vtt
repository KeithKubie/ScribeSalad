not just regular permutations super
 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.240
not just regular permutations super
permutations can leap tall buildings in

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250
permutations can leap tall buildings in
 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.880
permutations can leap tall buildings in
a single bound permutations what is a

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890
a single bound permutations what is a
 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.009
a single bound permutations what is a
super permutation first of all let's

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019
super permutation first of all let's
 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.560
super permutation first of all let's
talk about an ordinary permutation a

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570
talk about an ordinary permutation a
 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.110
talk about an ordinary permutation a
permutation is just like a shuffle so

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120
permutation is just like a shuffle so
 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.200
permutation is just like a shuffle so
imagine I had three cards one two and

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210
imagine I had three cards one two and
 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.750
imagine I had three cards one two and
three how many ways can I shuffle those

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760
three how many ways can I shuffle those
 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.939
three how many ways can I shuffle those
three cards so let's do that these are

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949
three cards so let's do that these are
 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.019
three cards so let's do that these are
the permutations

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029
the permutations
 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.779
the permutations
1 2 3 and we could have 1 3 2 2 1 3 2 3

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789
1 2 3 and we could have 1 3 2 2 1 3 2 3
 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.910
1 2 3 and we could have 1 3 2 2 1 3 2 3
1 and we could have 3 1 2 &amp; 3 2 1

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920
1 and we could have 3 1 2 &amp; 3 2 1
 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.350
1 and we could have 3 1 2 &amp; 3 2 1
there are six permutations that use the

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360
there are six permutations that use the
 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.180
there are six permutations that use the
numbers 1 2 3 and that is 3 factorial

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.190
numbers 1 2 3 and that is 3 factorial
 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.580
numbers 1 2 3 and that is 3 factorial
just to remind people 3 factorial means

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590
just to remind people 3 factorial means
 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.270
just to remind people 3 factorial means
3 times 2 times 1 and that's because

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280
3 times 2 times 1 and that's because
 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.950
3 times 2 times 1 and that's because
we've got three choices for the first

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960
we've got three choices for the first
 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.380
we've got three choices for the first
one two choices for the second one and

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390
one two choices for the second one and
 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.049
one two choices for the second one and
one choice for the last one and you

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059
one choice for the last one and you
 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.150
one choice for the last one and you
multiply those choices together that's 3

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160
multiply those choices together that's 3
 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.250
multiply those choices together that's 3
factorial that's 6 there are 6 ways to

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260
factorial that's 6 there are 6 ways to
 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.189
factorial that's 6 there are 6 ways to
do it there are super permutation it's a

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199
do it there are super permutation it's a
 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.520
do it there are super permutation it's a
string of numbers that contains all the

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530
string of numbers that contains all the
 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.190
string of numbers that contains all the
permutations so the super permutation of

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200
permutations so the super permutation of
 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.219
permutations so the super permutation of
1 2 &amp; 3 would have all the permutations

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229
1 2 &amp; 3 would have all the permutations
 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.060
1 2 &amp; 3 would have all the permutations
of 1 2 &amp; 3 contained within it so we

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070
of 1 2 &amp; 3 contained within it so we
 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.320
of 1 2 &amp; 3 contained within it so we
could just string these together now

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330
could just string these together now
 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.730
could just string these together now
that's simple right

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740
that's simple right
 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:26.030
that's simple right
1 2 3 1 3 2 2 1 3 2 3 1 3 1 2 3 2 1 so

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040
1 2 3 1 3 2 2 1 3 2 3 1 3 1 2 3 2 1 so
 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.399
1 2 3 1 3 2 2 1 3 2 3 1 3 1 2 3 2 1 so
that's a super permutation it has length

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409
that's a super permutation it has length
 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.010
that's a super permutation it has length
18 you don't seem that impressed with

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020
18 you don't seem that impressed with
 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.480
18 you don't seem that impressed with
that super permutation it doesn't

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490
that super permutation it doesn't
 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.569
that super permutation it doesn't
deserve its name as being super ok we

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579
deserve its name as being super ok we
 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.609
deserve its name as being super ok we
can do better what is the smallest

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619
can do better what is the smallest
 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.920
can do better what is the smallest
string of numbers that we can write that

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930
string of numbers that we can write that
 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.280
string of numbers that we can write that
contains all of permutations well how

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290
contains all of permutations well how
 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.510
contains all of permutations well how
about this one 1 2 3 1 2 1 3 2 1 all

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520
about this one 1 2 3 1 2 1 3 2 1 all
 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.270
about this one 1 2 3 1 2 1 3 2 1 all
right this has length 9 but it is a

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280
right this has length 9 but it is a
 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.139
right this has length 9 but it is a
super permutation and it's the shortest

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:53.149
super permutation and it's the shortest
 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:55.850
super permutation and it's the shortest
super permutation using 1 2 3 this check

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860
super permutation using 1 2 3 this check
 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.530
super permutation using 1 2 3 this check
so it has a have used overlaps this best

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540
so it has a have used overlaps this best
 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.160
so it has a have used overlaps this best
check 1 2 3 that's in there 1 3 2 I've

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170
check 1 2 3 that's in there 1 3 2 I've
 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.660
check 1 2 3 that's in there 1 3 2 I've
got it here 2 1 3

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670
got it here 2 1 3
 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.510
got it here 2 1 3
where is it there it is 2 3 1 right

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520
where is it there it is 2 3 1 right
 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.119
where is it there it is 2 3 1 right
there near the beginning 3 1 2 I bet

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129
there near the beginning 3 1 2 I bet
 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.380
there near the beginning 3 1 2 I bet
that is here and 3

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390
that is here and 3
 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.059
that is here and 3
- one is right at the end yes it

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069
- one is right at the end yes it
 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:17.100
- one is right at the end yes it
contains all the permutations but it is

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110
contains all the permutations but it is
 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:18.990
contains all the permutations but it is
the shortest string that contains all

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000
the shortest string that contains all
 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.660
the shortest string that contains all
the permutations and it has length 9 so

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670
the permutations and it has length 9 so
 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.330
the permutations and it has length 9 so
let's have a look at the shortest super

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340
let's have a look at the shortest super
 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.020
let's have a look at the shortest super
permutations for all the values 1 2 3 1

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030
permutations for all the values 1 2 3 1
 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.970
permutations for all the values 1 2 3 1
2 4 let's have a look so they start with

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980
2 4 let's have a look so they start with
 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.440
2 4 let's have a look so they start with
1 ok the super permutation containing

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450
1 ok the super permutation containing
 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.900
1 ok the super permutation containing
all the permutations of 1 is 1 and then

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910
all the permutations of 1 is 1 and then
 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.050
all the permutations of 1 is 1 and then
we just check yes that contains all the

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060
we just check yes that contains all the
 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.630
we just check yes that contains all the
permutations it has length 1

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640
permutations it has length 1
 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.940
permutations it has length 1
great well what is the super permutation

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950
great well what is the super permutation
 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:54.810
great well what is the super permutation
for 1 &amp; 2 it is 1 to 1 so it has 1 &amp; 2

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820
for 1 &amp; 2 it is 1 to 1 so it has 1 &amp; 2
 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.449
for 1 &amp; 2 it is 1 to 1 so it has 1 &amp; 2
and it has 2 &amp; 1 that's all you need and

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459
and it has 2 &amp; 1 that's all you need and
 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:00.479
and it has 2 &amp; 1 that's all you need and
that has length 3 as you can see now for

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489
that has length 3 as you can see now for
 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:03.300
that has length 3 as you can see now for
3 we've done that one and we have a

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310
3 we've done that one and we have a
 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.070
3 we've done that one and we have a
super permutation of length 9 now for

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080
super permutation of length 9 now for
 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.830
super permutation of length 9 now for
I'm gonna take 4 has length 33 so let's

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840
I'm gonna take 4 has length 33 so let's
 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.290
I'm gonna take 4 has length 33 so let's
have a look at what that looks like 1 2

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:13.300
have a look at what that looks like 1 2
 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:19.350
have a look at what that looks like 1 2
3 4 2 1 3 2 1 4 3 2 1

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360
3 4 2 1 3 2 1 4 3 2 1
 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.620
3 4 2 1 3 2 1 4 3 2 1
there we go so that has length 33 and it

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630
there we go so that has length 33 and it
 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.160
there we go so that has length 33 and it
contains all the permutations so 5 what

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170
contains all the permutations so 5 what
 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.350
contains all the permutations so 5 what
is the super permutation 5 it has length

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360
is the super permutation 5 it has length
 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.050
is the super permutation 5 it has length
153 so I'm like that one out

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060
153 so I'm like that one out
 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.310
153 so I'm like that one out
it is escalating and then for 6 don't

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:38.320
it is escalating and then for 6 don't
 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:43.890
it is escalating and then for 6 don't
know no we don't know what is the super

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900
know no we don't know what is the super
 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.449
know no we don't know what is the super
permutation or the minimum super

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459
permutation or the minimum super
 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:50.430
permutation or the minimum super
permutation using 1 6 we have a guess ok

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440
permutation using 1 6 we have a guess ok
 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.490
permutation using 1 6 we have a guess ok
so there is a pattern of maybe this

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500
so there is a pattern of maybe this
 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.800
so there is a pattern of maybe this
guess is right have a look this first

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810
guess is right have a look this first
 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.759
guess is right have a look this first
number it was 1 and that is 1 factorial

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769
number it was 1 and that is 1 factorial
 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:01.289
number it was 1 and that is 1 factorial
the second number is 3 actually that

00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:01.299
the second number is 3 actually that
 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:03.600
the second number is 3 actually that
turns out to be 1 factorial plus 2

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.610
turns out to be 1 factorial plus 2
 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:08.789
turns out to be 1 factorial plus 2
factorial 9 1 factorial plus 2 factorial

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:08.799
factorial 9 1 factorial plus 2 factorial
 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:11.460
factorial 9 1 factorial plus 2 factorial
plus 3 factorial you might notice a

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470
plus 3 factorial you might notice a
 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.050
plus 3 factorial you might notice a
pattern for 33

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060
pattern for 33
 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.020
pattern for 33
well that is 1 factorial plus 2

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030
well that is 1 factorial plus 2
 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.449
well that is 1 factorial plus 2
factorial plus 3 factorial plus 4

going to be adding up the factorials

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430
going to be adding up the factorials
 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.510

let's do it 1 factorial + 2 factorial

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.200

that's a pretty good guess for the

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210
that's a pretty good guess for the
 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.150
that's a pretty good guess for the

unfortunately recently someone found a

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240
unfortunately recently someone found a
 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.650
unfortunately recently someone found a
super permutation that is shorter in

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:01.660
super permutation that is shorter in
 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.439
super permutation that is shorter in
fact they found a super permutation that

00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:04.449
fact they found a super permutation that
 

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:10.409
fact they found a super permutation that
had length 872 1 shorter the pattern did

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:10.419
had length 872 1 shorter the pattern did
 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:14.640
had length 872 1 shorter the pattern did
not hold it was 1 shorter so and I can

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:14.650
not hold it was 1 shorter so and I can
 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:18.120
not hold it was 1 shorter so and I can
show you what that looks like this is it

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:18.130
show you what that looks like this is it
 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:22.649
show you what that looks like this is it
on the screen and we still don't know if

00:05:22.649 --> 00:05:22.659
on the screen and we still don't know if
 

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:24.480
on the screen and we still don't know if
that's the shortest one we still don't

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:24.490
that's the shortest one we still don't
 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:28.770
that's the shortest one we still don't
know if the answer is 872 it's possible

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:28.780
know if the answer is 872 it's possible
 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:32.430
know if the answer is 872 it's possible
there is a shorter one out there it was

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:32.440
there is a shorter one out there it was
 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.999
there is a shorter one out there it was
a little bit of a shock well you can see

00:05:35.999 --> 00:05:36.009
a little bit of a shock well you can see
 

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:38.339
a little bit of a shock well you can see
this pattern and there's a reason why

00:05:38.339 --> 00:05:38.349
this pattern and there's a reason why
 

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:39.870
this pattern and there's a reason why
you would think this pattern would hold

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:39.880
you would think this pattern would hold
 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:43.170
you would think this pattern would hold
there is a way to construct the next

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:43.180
there is a way to construct the next
 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:46.860
there is a way to construct the next
super permutation from the previous one

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:46.870
super permutation from the previous one
 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:50.430
super permutation from the previous one
and if you construct it in that way then

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:50.440
and if you construct it in that way then
 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:52.439
and if you construct it in that way then
absolutely the super permutation will

00:05:52.439 --> 00:05:52.449
absolutely the super permutation will
 

00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:55.080
absolutely the super permutation will
have that length and so they were just

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:55.090
have that length and so they were just
 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:56.790
have that length and so they were just
thinking well that must be the minimum

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:56.800
thinking well that must be the minimum
 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.969
thinking well that must be the minimum
length this shows they were wrong it

00:05:59.969 --> 00:05:59.979
length this shows they were wrong it
 

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:02.399
length this shows they were wrong it
isn't the minimum length it is not

00:06:02.399 --> 00:06:02.409
isn't the minimum length it is not
 

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:04.439
isn't the minimum length it is not
necessary for it to be the minimum thing

00:06:04.439 --> 00:06:04.449
necessary for it to be the minimum thing
 

00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:07.409
necessary for it to be the minimum thing
now you can see that this might become

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:07.419
now you can see that this might become
 

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:09.300
now you can see that this might become
harder the large of these numbers

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:09.310
harder the large of these numbers
 

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:10.640
harder the large of these numbers
becomes it's it's actually

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:10.650
becomes it's it's actually
 

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:14.370
becomes it's it's actually
computationally hard so maybe we'll find

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:14.380
computationally hard so maybe we'll find
 

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:16.980
computationally hard so maybe we'll find
what the minimum length is 4 6 and then

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:16.990
what the minimum length is 4 6 and then
 

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:19.200
what the minimum length is 4 6 and then
we'll have to work out 7 and so on and

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:19.210
we'll have to work out 7 and so on and
 

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:21.770
we'll have to work out 7 and so on and
this is going to get harder and harder

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:21.780
this is going to get harder and harder
 

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:26.159
this is going to get harder and harder
unless we find some clever construction

00:06:26.159 --> 00:06:26.169
unless we find some clever construction
 

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:29.129
unless we find some clever construction
of the minimum super permutations that

00:06:29.129 --> 00:06:29.139
of the minimum super permutations that
 

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:31.800
of the minimum super permutations that
tells us what the minimum length is this

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:31.810
tells us what the minimum length is this
 

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:33.510
tells us what the minimum length is this
is worth comparing to something called

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:33.520
is worth comparing to something called
 

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.790
is worth comparing to something called
two Brown sequences and the brown

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:35.800
two Brown sequences and the brown
 

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.090
two Brown sequences and the brown
sequences are a similar idea

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:38.100
sequences are a similar idea
 

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:41.030
sequences are a similar idea
but they contain all the sequences using

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:41.040
but they contain all the sequences using
 

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:42.230
but they contain all the sequences using
let's say one two three you would

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:42.240
let's say one two three you would
 

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:43.550
let's say one two three you would
contain all the sequences it would look

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:43.560
contain all the sequences it would look
 

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:46.570
contain all the sequences it would look
like this so here's a the brown sequence

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:46.580
like this so here's a the brown sequence
 

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:53.660
like this so here's a the brown sequence
similar idea 1 1 1 2 1 1 3 1 2 2 1 2 3 1

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:53.670
similar idea 1 1 1 2 1 1 3 1 2 2 1 2 3 1
 

00:06:53.670 --> 00:07:03.920
similar idea 1 1 1 2 1 1 3 1 2 2 1 2 3 1
3 2 1 3 3 2 2 2 3 2 3 3 3 1 1 so here we

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:03.930
3 2 1 3 3 2 2 2 3 2 3 3 3 1 1 so here we
 

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:07.870
3 2 1 3 3 2 2 2 3 2 3 3 3 1 1 so here we
have a sequence and it contains all

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:07.880
have a sequence and it contains all
 

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:10.610
have a sequence and it contains all
sequences of length 3 using numbers 1 2

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:10.620
sequences of length 3 using numbers 1 2
 

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:14.600
sequences of length 3 using numbers 1 2
3 so 1 1 1 is in there 1 1 2 is in there

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:14.610
3 so 1 1 1 is in there 1 1 2 is in there
 

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:18.230
3 so 1 1 1 is in there 1 1 2 is in there
3 3 3 is in there 3 1 3 is in there so

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:18.240
3 3 3 is in there 3 1 3 is in there so
 

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:20.030
3 3 3 is in there 3 1 3 is in there so
the brown sequences are a lot like super

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:20.040
the brown sequences are a lot like super
 

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:22.490
the brown sequences are a lot like super
permutations but the sequences inside

permutations but the sequences inside
 

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:26.330
permutations but the sequences inside
are allowed to contain duplicates but we

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:26.340
are allowed to contain duplicates but we
 

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:29.210
are allowed to contain duplicates but we
have a way to construct the brown

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:29.220
have a way to construct the brown
 

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:32.180
have a way to construct the brown
sequences and it constructs the minimum

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:32.190
sequences and it constructs the minimum
 

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:34.370
sequences and it constructs the minimum
length the brown sequence as well and

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:34.380
length the brown sequence as well and
 

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:36.890
length the brown sequence as well and
they have practical applications in

they have practical applications in
 

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:39.620
they have practical applications in
robotics and in actually lots of other
