00:00:06.717 --> 00:00:10.159
If insects suddenly morphed
into large beings,

00:00:10.159 --> 00:00:12.449
and decided to wage war on us,

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:15.731
there's no doubt that humans
would lose.

00:00:15.731 --> 00:00:18.625
We'd simply be crushed 
by their sheer numbers.

00:00:18.625 --> 00:00:23.621
There are an estimated 10 quintillion
individual insects on Earth.

00:00:23.621 --> 00:00:27.095
That's a one followed by 19 zeroes.

00:00:27.095 --> 00:00:29.960
So, compared with our population
of about 7 billion,

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.204
these invertebrates outnumber
us by more than a billion to one.

00:00:35.204 --> 00:00:39.646
Their astounding numbers exist
at the species level, as well.

00:00:39.646 --> 00:00:43.122
There are more than 60,000
vertebrate species on the planet.

00:00:43.122 --> 00:00:47.761
But the class of insects contains
a million known species,

00:00:47.761 --> 00:00:51.458
and many others 
that haven't been classified.

00:00:51.458 --> 00:00:58.445
In fact, these critters make up 
approximately 75% of all animals on Earth.

00:00:58.445 --> 00:01:01.095
So, what's their secret to success?

00:01:01.095 --> 00:01:03.368
Insect abundance comes down
to many things

00:01:03.368 --> 00:01:08.293
that together make them some of the most
adaptable and resilient creatures,

00:01:08.293 --> 00:01:11.346
beginning with their impressive 
ability to breed.

00:01:11.346 --> 00:01:15.246
Many species can produce hundreds
of offspring within their lifetimes.

00:01:15.246 --> 00:01:16.859
Most offspring will die,

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:20.714
but more than enough will survive
into adulthood to reproduce.

00:01:20.714 --> 00:01:23.457
Offspring also mature very rapidly,

00:01:23.457 --> 00:01:26.704
so the cycle of reproduction
resumes quickly,

00:01:26.704 --> 00:01:30.403
and can occur over and over again
in a short time.

00:01:30.403 --> 00:01:32.402
These numbers mean that as a class,

00:01:32.402 --> 00:01:36.783
insects harbor a tremendous amount
of genetic diversity.

00:01:36.783 --> 00:01:39.995
The different species contain
a wealth of genetic data

00:01:39.995 --> 00:01:43.533
that give them the necessary adaptations
they need to thrive

00:01:43.533 --> 00:01:46.496
in a range of environments
across the planet.

00:01:46.496 --> 00:01:49.779
Even some of the most extreme
environments are in bounds;

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:54.091
Flat bark beetles can live at
-40 degrees Fahrenheit,

00:01:54.091 --> 00:01:56.415
Sahara Desert ants can venture out

00:01:56.415 --> 00:02:00.431
when surface temperatures exceed
155 degrees,

00:02:00.431 --> 00:02:06.489
and some bumblebees can survive
18,000 feet above sea level.

00:02:06.489 --> 00:02:09.868
Insect exoskeletons also work
like body armor,

00:02:09.868 --> 00:02:12.390
protecting insects against
the outside world

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.493
and helping them cope with habitats
that other creatures can't.

00:02:16.493 --> 00:02:18.110
Even their small size,

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.455
which we might see as a disadvantage,

00:02:20.455 --> 00:02:22.902
is something they use to their benefit.

00:02:22.902 --> 00:02:24.877
Because most species are so tiny,

00:02:24.877 --> 00:02:27.698
millions of insects can inhabit
a small space

00:02:27.698 --> 00:02:31.559
and make use of all the available
resources within it.

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:36.350
This means they can occupy hundreds
of different niches across ecosystems.

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.930
Some insects survive by eating the roots,

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:39.959
stems,

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:40.769
leaves,

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:41.586
seeds,

00:02:41.586 --> 00:02:42.315
pollen,

00:02:42.315 --> 00:02:44.568
and nectar of specific plants.

00:02:44.568 --> 00:02:46.082
Others, like wasps,

00:02:46.082 --> 00:02:50.063
make use of live insects 
by paralyzing the victims

00:02:50.063 --> 00:02:52.097
and laying their eggs inside

00:02:52.097 --> 00:02:54.191
so that when the hatchlings emerge,

00:02:54.191 --> 00:02:57.802
they can eat their way out
and get nourishment.

00:02:57.802 --> 00:03:00.595
Mosquitos and biting flies feed on blood,

00:03:00.595 --> 00:03:05.106
taking advantage of this unusual resource
to ensure their survival.

00:03:05.106 --> 00:03:08.867
And a whole bunch of other insects
have built a niche around feces.

00:03:08.867 --> 00:03:10.556
Flies lay their eggs there,

00:03:10.556 --> 00:03:14.298
and some beetles even build
large balls out of animal dung,

00:03:14.298 --> 00:03:18.268
which they eat and use as accommodation
for their eggs.

00:03:18.268 --> 00:03:21.972
And then there's the insects' mighty power
of metamorphosis.

00:03:21.972 --> 00:03:24.611
This trait not only transforms insects,

00:03:24.611 --> 00:03:29.725
but also helps them maximize
the available resources in an ecosystem.

00:03:29.725 --> 00:03:31.013
Take butterflies.

00:03:31.013 --> 00:03:32.888
In their larval caterpillar form,

00:03:32.888 --> 00:03:36.198
they chomp hungrily through leaves
at a rapid rate

00:03:36.198 --> 00:03:38.706
to help them grow and spin cocoons.

00:03:38.706 --> 00:03:40.574
But when they emerge as butterflies,

00:03:40.574 --> 00:03:43.337
these insects feed only on flower nectar.

00:03:43.337 --> 00:03:47.210
Metamorphosis means the larvae
and adults of one species

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:50.068
will never compete for the same resource,

00:03:50.068 --> 00:03:53.195
so they successfully share 
an ecological niche

00:03:53.195 --> 00:03:55.671
without limiting their own success.

00:03:55.671 --> 00:03:57.373
This process is so efficient

00:03:57.373 --> 00:04:03.687
that an incredible 86% of insect species
undergo complete metamorphosis.

00:04:03.687 --> 00:04:05.232
We're big and they're small,

00:04:05.232 --> 00:04:09.957
so it's easy to forget that these critters
are moving in their millions

00:04:09.957 --> 00:04:11.339
all around us,

00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:12.953
all the time.

00:04:12.953 --> 00:04:15.268
But examine almost any patch of ground,

00:04:15.268 --> 00:04:17.267
and you're sure to find them there.

00:04:17.267 --> 00:04:20.877
Their numbers are immense,
and their success is unmatched.

00:04:20.877 --> 00:04:23.159
We may have to accept 
that it's insects,

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:24.641
not us,

00:04:24.641 --> 00:04:27.109
that are the true conquerors 
of the planet.
