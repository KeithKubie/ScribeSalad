00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:05.470
So we can technically use the mean integrated square error or

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:11.320
AMISE to select the optimal bandwidth for a kernel density estimation.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:16.210
However, for general kernels, this is very difficult to estimate.

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:20.960
So the first rule of thumb is given by Silverman's Rule of Thumb.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.840
This works only for one dimensional data.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.890
The optimal bandwidth is given by H, which is four times sigma raised to

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:35.560
the power of five, divided by 3n, the entire thing to the one fifth power.

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:41.930
In this case sigma is the standard deviation of the distribution.

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.620
In this case, the kernel is also assumed to be Gaussian.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:54.570
A more generalized way to obtain a bandwidth is given by Scott's Rule.

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.500
This shows you the formula to obtain the general bandwidth in D dimensions.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.420
For a one dimensional case, we put D equals one.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:05.030
In this case,

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.160
the Sigma here shows the covariance matrix in the D dimensions of the data.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:17.840
In fact, when we determine the kernel density estimate of our data here,

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.860
we used the Scott's rule to find our bandwidth.

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:28.250
All the different factors we obtained was simply some fraction of

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.510
the bandwidth obtained using Scott's rule.

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:35.740
Notice we also used the Gaussian kernel here to get the KD.
