00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.920
Very romantic and very applicable as I said.

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:08.360
And you're going to complain, that uh, wait a minute, we haven't done two Möbiuses of the same chirality.

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:14.040
But we'll visit that because that one is, shall I say, disappointingly interesting.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.060
Or is it, interestingly disappointing?

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:20.820
It's not going to be something as romantic as this but, it is nonetheless, quite baffling.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:27.600
But in the first instance, let's get to grips with why you get flat squares.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.220
There is a good way to think abut this.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:34.120
You see as usual in science, in general and in mathematics in particular, sometimes if you

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:39.680
take the, a good point of view, everything becomes clean and amusing. But if you take the wrong point of view

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.400
everything becomes ugly and really painful.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.240
So, here is a straight against straight and we saw that if you cut this along the center line,

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.260
so you get the flat square, but now, let's understand why we get the flat square.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:56.240
Until now, in a silly attempt at fair tricks, I was leaving the cross cut until the end.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:03.080
A good point of view, however, is to cut one of the pieces completely around without any suspense.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.920
And then, of course it will remain for us to cut the remaining piece along the centre line

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.780
and we'll attempt that in a moment.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.940
When we cut one of the pieces all the way around the centre line, what we get is this.

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.260
We get a pair of handcuff-like objects connected by a straight belt

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
between. Untwisted belt.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.460
So what we have to do is cut this belt but along the centre line

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.100
and at this stage I think you can already visualize what's happening.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.880
What are we going to get when we finish cutting this?

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:38.420
Well, because when we are in this configuration and when we open it we get a square.

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.220
So you see where it comes from? It came from

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.740
this. You can see that was straight against straight, cut open,

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.740
and cut open, that's a square.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.140
So we now understand, we can visualize in our heads how this square comes about.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.700
How about straight against Möbius?

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.260
That's actually an interesting case. We shouldn't

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.880
make the suspense thus. We should cut one of the pieces all the way around.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.900
Which piece, it turns out that it's helpful to cut this straight part all the way around.

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:13.980
And we know that we get the flat square and our job is to understand why we get the flat square.

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.100
Okay, after we cut the straight part, what you get is this.

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.700
You can visualize right?

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:25.460
It's a pair of handcuffs again, but this time connected by a belt which is twisted.

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.460
Or if you like

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:32.200
you can have an untwisted belt but now handcuffs on opposite sides of the belt.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:39.060
So now-- So the previous case, straight against straight had handcuffs on both sides, both on the same sides

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.640
but here on this end and on this end, okay.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.980
Now what's going to happen if we cut this along the centre line? That's the finishing job but

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.880
before we do this, let me work a piece of magic.

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.260
I take this and then I turn this around

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.580
So I get exactly the same thing as the result

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.140
of two straight against straight. Two straight strips.

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.140
-And you're allowed to do that?

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.040
-That's not breaking any rules?

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.380
Well, who knows but it's the same piece of paper.

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:19.980
And I can start and finish where ever I like so if I cut this, I am going to get a square

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.600
This operation that I have just, this shenanigan that I have just performed in front of you

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:25.620
corresponds to the following thing.

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.840
If I cut this into, along the centre line

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.300
what you would get is not in the first instance

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.700
a flat square but you'd get something like this

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.700
Kind of a twisted version of flat square.

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.700
Like that. And

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.700
all you have to do is to

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.080
untwist it and then it becomes flat.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.180
and that corresponds to this operation of

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.760
taking this and then

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.280
turn around and here we are.

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.440
You get another flat square.

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:56.680
Okay, that's very nice!

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.220
Well it remains for us to try two Möbiuses

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.220
with the same chirality or the same twist.

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.740
Let's remember which way we are making the Möbius.

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:10.060
Let's twist it clockwise and the other one also

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.700
let's twist it clockwise.

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:18.760
By the way some of you might be worried, well, this is clockwise seen from this side but if you see it from this side it turns out to be the same thing.

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:21.920
So two of them clockwise, so we have

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:23.760
two Möbius strips

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.400
exactly of the same chirality

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:27.860
glued against each other.

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:32.660
I'd like to emphasize that this object is very very symmetric.

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:36.660
Two copies of the same Möbius strips, same including orientation

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.240
twisted the same way, glued at right angles

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:44.760
So if I position this way and turn it around this way you obtain exactly the same thing.

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.240
There's a symmetry there. A rotational symmetry.

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.460
On the other hand cutting this object along the centre lines is of course a symmetric operation.

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.460
I mean, it doesn't distinguish left or right.

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.340
So we are applying a symmetric operation to a symmetric object.

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:05.160
And there's a widespread believe, indeed a conviction in science that if you have a symmetric situation and apply a symmetric operation what you get out is symmetric.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.660
Okay, let's see if that's going to happen.

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:12.040
I'm going to cut this along the centre lines, respective centre lines.

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:16.040
A totally symmetric object and I'm doing a symmetric operation.

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:21.180
And you see why I call it interestingly disappointing, or disappointly interesting, in a moment.

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.620
And I cut it all the way around .

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.620
So here I go.

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:27.620
I finish cutting

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:28.460
everything.

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:31.360
And what emerges is first of all disappointing

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.400
because they separate. Oooh! How un-romantic, you know!

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.840
As opposed to the linked hearts before.

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.060
But there's something really wrong about this

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:44.500
unromantic object. You see I got two pieces and one of them looks like a boat

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:52.260
and this is what mathematicians like to call a 2-gon, you see. You know n-gon because it only has two vertices it's a 2-gon.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
And it looks like a boat.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.900
The other one is also a 2-gon but it's twisted in space

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:59.600
so you can not actually untwist it

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.080
however hard you try

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.180
into this shape.

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:07.980
So, from a symmetric object cut along in a symmetric fashion we got two

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:13.840
objects that are not the same as symmetric object. How did this happen? It's really strange.
