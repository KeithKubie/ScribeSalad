[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:08.340
GAYATHRI RAJAN: Wow, thank you.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.970
I'm truly excited to be
here at the end of, I think,

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:14.020
a remarkable day.

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:15.670
I see such energy in the room.

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:18.000
I can't believe you guys have
gone through a whole day.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.130
And clearly it must have
been something that got

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.490
you inspired and invigorated.

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:27.460
So the theme of sharing
personal stories--

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.370
I'd like to share some
of my personal learnings

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:36.160
as I've made my way through
a pretty long career in tech.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:41.600
And hopefully, some of it will
be good learning for you, too.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.784
So now, like many of you in the
audience, I'm living my dream.

00:00:44.784 --> 00:00:45.700
I mean, aren't we all?

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:46.690
Look at where we are.

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.690
Look at what we're doing.

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.720
This is what I always wanted
to do when I was young.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.360
But I didn't account
for two things.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.780
One, I didn't
realize how hard it

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.020
can be to be a woman
in tech, particularly

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.590
as you become more senior.

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.082
So it's going to get worse.

00:01:06.082 --> 00:01:08.290
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:09.280
But it's all good.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.580
And two, and because it's
going to get worse, or harder,

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.500
it's really important.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:16.250
I've got to stop--

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.796
I realized I had to stop keeping
a score and grading myself.

00:01:20.796 --> 00:01:21.920
You know what we do, right?

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.336
We are always up there grading
ourselves, giving ourselves

00:01:24.336 --> 00:01:27.200
little pluses and minus points.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.080
The reality is there will be
A-plus days and there will be

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.220
F-minus days--

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.460
you know, B-plus years
and lucky breaks.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.007
This is continuous learning.

00:01:40.007 --> 00:01:41.840
We're going to go through
the ups and downs.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.360
It's not a series
of exams that we

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.120
need to get perfect grades on.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.115
And I wish I knew
this at the start.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.980
So I'm going to recount
two episodes in my life

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.190
and my career that
are pretty personal.

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.680
These were days--
these were two days,

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:07.580
and they were closer to
the F days than A-plus.

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.510
But they taught me some
really powerful lessons.

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.040
The first was several
years ago at Google.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.450
I was the product lead of
a very successful project.

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.490
We'd had a ton of
impact, and I'd

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:21.950
been doing this
for several years.

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.500
And you know, things
were going great.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.750
In a turn of events that
I didn't quite foresee,

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.200
a new business leader
was hired into the org.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.330
And this person then
proceeded to hire

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:41.690
a product leader, so essentially
someone who would be my boss.

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.420
So on that day, with
very little warning,

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.970
I was asked to introduce this
new product leader to my team.

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.270
And as I was doing
so, I caught the eye

00:02:53.270 --> 00:03:00.920
of two women on my team,
and the look of devastation,

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:07.010
because they could
see how shaken I was.

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.590
And that, just
catching their eyes

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.270
and seeing what they were
saying through their eyes

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:16.250
made it so much worse.

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.520
And I wanted to go home and cry.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.520
But that night, I had agreed to
meet a group of women friends

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.580
after work, so I
soldiered on, and I

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.500
went to have dinner with them.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.410
And one of them took
me aside and said,

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.530
Gayathri, someday
you'll thank him.

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:36.620
You'll thank Mr.--

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.720
I'm going to call him Mr. B--

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.740
for showing you that
it's time to leave.

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:43.250
And I did.

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:44.060
I left that team.

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:45.560
I survived.

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.690
And the two women in the
audience on my team--

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.080
but I'm looking at two women
in the audience as I say this--

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.490
they survived, and they thrived.

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:57.800
In fact, they're
both on their way

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.500
to becoming very senior
and accomplished leaders

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:02.290
in technology.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.240
So I thank the
wisdom of my friend,

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.930
the one who gave me the
advice that it was time to go,

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.560
and the sadness in those women's
eyes, because they inspired

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.190
me to make the change,
to move forward,

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.260
and to continue to develop
myself as a leader.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.350
The second episode
happened just last year.

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:28.410
And in this case, it was
just about a year ago.

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.790
I was working at a
new effort at Google,

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:34.820
and it had been two years,
and we saw great promise.

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:36.297
This was a new market.

00:04:36.297 --> 00:04:38.130
We didn't really know
quite how to crack it,

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:42.480
but we knew when we did, it
would be kind of awesome.

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.080
But we hadn't launched
a significant product

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.610
or had impact.

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:53.300
And at that time, at Google
we run these annual surveys.

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.960
It's a 360-degree survey
where people on the team

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.100
give feedback to each other,
but also to their manager.

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:04.670
And my manager feedback
scores were terrible.

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:06.450
I mean, they were the worst--

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:09.950
I'll still never forget
opening them up and seeing

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:11.960
just how awful they were--

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.900
the worst I had ever
experienced in the almost decade

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:17.900
that I've been at Google.

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.420
And so when I got this
feedback, it hit me really hard,

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:21.500
because I'd spent--

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.240
I think like many
of you, as women, we

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.450
do spend a lot of our time
thinking about other people,

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:29.570
and we really sort of
strive to do the right thing

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:34.620
by our family, by our spouses,
by our children, by our team.

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.580
And so this felt very personal.

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:42.650
So later that evening, I met up
with my 21-year-old daughter,

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:47.420
and in a strange role reversal,
she asked me how my day was.

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:51.770
I mean, women, please ask
your mother how their day is.

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:54.150
We don't do that enough.

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:56.150
And of course, that was
not the best day for her

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:58.880
to ask that question, because
I just went on and on.

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.700
I went in, and she listened
to me, which was, again, also

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:05.275
a surprising change.

00:06:05.275 --> 00:06:07.650
And then she asked me, what
are you going to do about it?

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:11.780
And I launched into a slew of
excuses, and she stopped me,

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:14.510
and she said, you're feeling
betrayed, aren't you?

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:15.670
I said yes.

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:18.350
And she said, but are you
going to ask your team

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:19.430
why they feel this way?

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:27.080
And I realized then that I
was making this about myself.

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:28.279
It was my own baggage.

00:06:28.279 --> 00:06:29.570
I was feeling sorry for myself.

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:32.090
I felt like, how could this
happen to me, when I'm so good,

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:34.910
instead of really
considering the feedback

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:39.200
and considering what I needed
to do to fix the situation.

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.689
So why am I sharing all this?

00:06:41.689 --> 00:06:42.980
I mean, these were two of the--

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:46.580
I've had some pretty awesome
days, but these were hard days.

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:50.250
Well, firstly to show
you that it never ends.

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:55.430
It doesn't-- the hard knocks,
the questioning, the mistakes,

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:57.660
and the learning.

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:00.170
In the first episode, I
realized that even though I

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:03.080
was doing my work, I
really hadn't understood

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:06.909
the context of the organization,
which is very, very important.

00:07:06.909 --> 00:07:08.450
And sometimes women
in particular, we

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:10.116
get our little heads
down and we're just

00:07:10.116 --> 00:07:12.117
doing the right
thing, and we forget

00:07:12.117 --> 00:07:13.700
that there is a
context around us that

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:16.430
really needs to be considered.

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:17.600
And the second--

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.670
I had not invested in
really understanding

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:21.350
how my team was
being impacted as I

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:24.080
was striving to get
us to a goal post that

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:25.444
kept getting pushed out.

00:07:25.444 --> 00:07:27.860
I wasn't really looking around
and actually understanding,

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:30.890
trying to make sense of what
was happening to the people who

00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:33.140
were with me on that journey.

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:36.830
So there was definitely some
personal learning for me

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:39.020
in both these cases.

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:44.360
But at those key moments, I
also found incredible support

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:46.580
and strength in the
women around me--

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:51.480
my friends, my team, and
now even my daughter.

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:53.600
They showed me with clear eyes--

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:55.310
they saw me with clear eyes.

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:58.370
They felt my pain, and
they also showed me

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:00.830
that there was a way out of it.

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:03.890
Now, I know we all have
things we need to do

00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:06.200
as we learn on our journey.

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:08.600
But I feel at the same time
it's really important for us

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:13.250
to take the time and make
a special effort to help

00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:16.430
women around us
through their journeys.

00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:19.720
There's real power
in this, as I found.

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:22.280
And I have seen three simple
things that I try to do.

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:23.450
They're really small.

00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:26.140
They don't really
take much time.

00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:27.050
But I find them--

00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:31.040
I find that these
are really important.

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:34.669
When I see women going
through a rough patch,

00:08:34.669 --> 00:08:36.489
I make the time
to listen to them.

00:08:36.489 --> 00:08:38.030
I make the time to
sort of understand

00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:39.500
what they're going
through and be

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:41.510
a sounding block or an advisor.

00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:47.060
The second is, it's sort of--

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:49.722
I think every one of you has
experienced this, very likely,

00:08:49.722 --> 00:08:50.930
in some fashion or the other.

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:53.690
In large meetings,
when women talk,

00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:56.000
sometimes they don't
often feel heard.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.670
I find it really simple,
but really powerful,

00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:02.900
to reinforce what
another woman said.

00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:06.590
Oh, Amy, that was a great idea,
following up on what she said.

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:09.260
And just having
someone reinforce

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.030
that can be really powerful.

00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:11.930
It's so simple to do.

00:09:14.477 --> 00:09:16.310
And finally, when women
question themselves,

00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:19.830
as we all do, as I did,
if they're good enough

00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:22.340
or whether they're an
admissions mistake,

00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:25.100
I tell them to get
over it and own it.

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:26.030
Own the work.

00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:27.170
Own where you are.

00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:29.540
Own your mistakes, and
own the path forward.

00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:33.140
And it's really important
for us to get that counsel,

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:39.980
particularly when we're
starting to feel like we are--

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:41.660
we're not doing what, you know--

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:43.550
when things aren't working.

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:45.950
We're actually in a really
good place for a reason.

00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:48.750
All of you are here
for a very good reason.

00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:54.580
It wasn't a glitch in
Google's selection process.

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:57.120
But there's a fourth.

00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:01.260
I get myself back up from
whatever pit I've fallen into.

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.990
I mean, those two
experiences that I recounted,

00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:06.240
they ended up in making
me make some changes that

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:07.290
were pretty significant.

00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:10.320
But they also sort
of made me realize

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:14.460
that this was not just something
that I needed to do for myself.

00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:17.470
Particularly as I've
sort of, over the years,

00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:20.070
as I've become older
and more senior,

00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:24.060
I found that there are several
younger, more junior women who

00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:26.790
look up to me to
see what I'm doing.

00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:31.830
When I bounce back, they know
that it's just as hard for me

00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:35.970
as it is for them, and
that they can do it too.

00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:39.930
So really, what we do
for ourselves is a gift

00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:41.370
we give other women.

00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:46.200
That's the biggest learning
I've had in my life in tech.

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:48.030
But now there's so
much more we can do.

00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:50.470
All of you in this room,
think about the power

00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:53.410
you have-- the networking,
the connections you can build,

00:10:53.410 --> 00:10:55.190
that we can do for each other.

00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:57.030
We'll never stop
having those bad days.

00:10:57.030 --> 00:11:00.150
I'm pretty sure I'm going
to have quite a few more

00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:03.120
as I continue on my journey.

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:07.260
But let's aim to be that leader
at whatever level, at whatever

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:10.230
stage, who's there
to wipe the tears

00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:13.970
and offer a glimpse
of the road ahead,

00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:16.080
and who can show
that it can be done,

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:20.130
that really anything
is possible.

00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:22.220
So with that, I
want to thank you.

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:24.110
I hope you take
something out of it.

00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:25.850
But really, more
importantly, I hope

00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:29.600
you take that the real power
that comes out of all this

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:32.310
is the power within you,
and every one of you,

00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:36.320
and the power we have in
really bringing the best out

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:38.250
of each other forward.

00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:39.020
Thank you.

00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:40.220
[APPLAUSE]
