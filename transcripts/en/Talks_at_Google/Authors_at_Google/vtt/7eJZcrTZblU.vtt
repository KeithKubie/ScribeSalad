JOHN HANKE: So I'm
going to introduce

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:08.332
James Frey, who's here to talk
about his book, "Endgame."

00:00:08.332 --> 00:00:11.795
We've got a bunch of people from
the Niantic team here-- very

00:00:11.795 --> 00:00:12.760
cool.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:13.740
My name is John Hanke.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.715
For you guys that
don't know me, I've

00:00:15.715 --> 00:00:18.320
been at Google for
over 10 years now.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.245
I came in in 2004
when Google acquired

00:00:20.245 --> 00:00:21.955
a company called
Keyhole and worked

00:00:21.955 --> 00:00:24.730
on Google Earth and Google
Maps a really long time

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.260
before we started a
project called Niantic.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:28.830
And with Niantic,
we've been working

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.420
to create games that happen
out in the real world,

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.170
and that bend fiction and
mobile gameplay in a new way.

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.390
"Ingress" is the game
that's out there right now.

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:43.620
And the next big thing for us is
this project called "Endgame."

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:44.680
James called.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.980
Actually, his agents called
me a couple years ago

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.210
and said that James
wanted to I talk to me.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.306
And I didn't know who
James was at the time,

00:00:52.306 --> 00:00:54.180
but I quickly did some
research and found out

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.239
that he's a very
established author,

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:00.155
wrote a book called "A
Million Little Pieces,"

00:01:00.155 --> 00:01:03.165
"New York Times" best
seller, critically acclaimed.

00:01:03.165 --> 00:01:05.890
"Bright Shiny Morning," another
critically acclaimed book--

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.120
probably my favorite of
James' what he calls, I guess,

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.544
"big boy fiction."

00:01:11.544 --> 00:01:13.210
As I got to know James
better, I learned

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:14.990
that he worked in Hollywood.

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.000
He directed movies,
wrote movies,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.690
made movies out here
for about 10 years

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.540
before moving to the East Coast
to become a real, bona fide,

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.130
critically acclaimed novelist.

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.000
What I also learned
is that he has

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.950
this really innovative approach
to writing and developing

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.690
fictions.

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.510
He created this company
called Full Fathom Five,

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.190
employs a lot of writers
in this collaborative way.

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.440
And they've written a lot
of young adult fiction,

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.840
including "I am
Number Four," which

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.900
was a movie that
James co-developed

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.620
and produced with
Steven Spielberg.

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.290
But they also had developed
games and audiobooks that

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.350
accompany the novels, and done
some incredibly innovative

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:54.490
things with technology.

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.330
And James explained
that he was conceiving

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.610
of this project that,
from the very beginning,

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.486
would create a universe that
would unfold though novels

00:02:03.486 --> 00:02:05.360
and through movies, and
through mobile games.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.440
And he basically pitched me
kind of the exact same things

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.739
that we had been talking
about inside Niantic.

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:14.280
But the cool thing
was, it was coming

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.440
from a world-class creative
who had this already

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.990
stellar reputation as a
novelist and writer and somebody

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.970
deeply intertwined with the
film and movie industry.

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.880
And I thought it was really
the perfect opportunity for us

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.260
to take this technology
we've been working on,

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.410
and to marry it with
a world-class creative

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.760
and to see what we
can invent in terms

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.410
of a new form of storytelling.

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.520
And we're well into that.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.975
We have a site up now
called Ancient Society.

00:02:40.975 --> 00:02:43.586
It's where the first glimpse
of what we've been working on

00:02:43.586 --> 00:02:46.260
is out there, and a game that
will come out next year that

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.920
will reinforce the novel.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.715
But I think James is here to
talk more about all of that.

00:02:50.715 --> 00:02:52.090
So I'll turn it
over to you, sir.

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.970
JAMES FREY: Thanks.

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.920
I think John just said
everything I was going to say.

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.740
I have a weird history
with this building.

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.680
It's always cool to
be here, because I

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.100
used to live-- I lived
in LA for a long time.

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:09.570
And I lived five blocks from
here, from 1994 to 2002.

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:15.650
And I met my now wife when she
was working here at Chiat/Day

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.700
making commercials for Apple.

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.225
And so I often used to
walk over and pick her up

00:03:21.225 --> 00:03:22.350
at the end of her work day.

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.850
And we would walk to--
there were very fewer bars

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.500
and restaurants around
here in the '90s.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.872
But we would walk to one
of them and hang out.

00:03:32.872 --> 00:03:34.330
And I love coming
to this building.

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.288
I love coming to this
building because of that.

00:03:36.288 --> 00:03:39.460
And I love coming to this
building because of Google.

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:41.260
It was in this building
where John I first

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:46.430
met a couple of years ago.

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:47.560
We cold-called them.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.160
I had heard of Niantic
and had done some research

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.030
into "Ingress."

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:54.790
And I was fascinated by it.

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:56.660
And I thought it was the future.

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.320
And that's what I
am trying to do,

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.011
is build the future-- not
build the future of technology,

00:04:03.011 --> 00:04:05.260
but build the future of
storytelling and entertainment

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.710
and how a storyteller can
use the technological tools

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:12.800
at our disposal now to
tell better stories, deeper

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.740
stories, more immersive stories,
more interesting and exciting

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:17.239
stories.

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.370
"Endgame" started, in a way,
when I was 10 years old.

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:25.840
I grew up in Cleveland.

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.650
And one day my mom brought home
this book called "Masquerade,"

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.120
which was a book by a
dude named Kip Williams.

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.050
He was an English painter.

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.380
And he had written this book
that was 16 pages of text,

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:39.780
and it had 16 paintings in it.

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.620
And embedded into the text and
the paintings were a puzzle.

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.490
If you could solve
the puzzle, it

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.700
led you somewhere
to the location

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.090
on Earth where he had buried
a solid gold, jewel-encrusted

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.530
rabbit worth $50,000.

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.190
As a 10-year-old, I had
dreams of solving this puzzle

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:59.350
and buying a giant
stack of "Star Wars"

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:02.930
action figures and
Atari cartridges.

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:04.570
And I became obsessed
with the book,

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:06.780
and I read it over and
over and over again.

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:10.870
And what I loved about
it was it somehow

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:13.470
was a book that became
more than a book.

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:17.660
Usually a book is a static
object and a static experience.

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:20.790
You sit somewhere and you read
it, and it exists on the pages

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:23.100
and it exists in your mind.

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.280
What I loved about
"Masquerade" is it somehow

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:26.370
became more than that.

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:28.690
It made me think about
it everywhere I went.

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:31.430
It made me look around
the world and wonder.

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:35.130
I knew in my 10-year-old
mind that the rabbit

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:39.000
wasn't buried in my schoolyard,
but I still wondered.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.170
I knew it wasn't buried
in my neighbor's backyard,

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:43.850
but I still wondered.

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:46.850
It somehow became more
than a book to me.

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:50.370
And it took somebody
three years to solve

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:51.960
the puzzle of "Masquerade."

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:55.550
The rabbit turned out to be
buried at the foot of a tree

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:57.450
where an ancient
English King was

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:00.899
rumored to have been beheaded.

00:06:00.899 --> 00:06:02.690
And then the world sort
of forgot about it.

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:03.670
I never did.

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:05.560
I always thought
about "Masquerade."

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:10.720
I always wanted to try to do
something like "Masquerade."

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:14.550
Like John said, I have
a weird work history.

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:17.180
I went to art school.

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:18.470
I moved to LA.

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:21.190
I worked in the film
business for a long time.

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:22.430
I wrote some movies.

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:23.690
I directed a couple movies.

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:26.220
I produced some movies.

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:29.670
When I was 30 and I was
living right down the street,

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:32.160
I'd always-- the dream had
always been to write books.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.010
I quit, and I wrote a book.

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:39.180
I wrote "A Million Little
Pieces" right over there.

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:40.160
It came out.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.680
I was lucky enough
that it did well,

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:44.760
and I was able to not go
back into the film business,

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:45.550
just write books.

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:47.934
I did that for 10 years.

00:06:47.934 --> 00:06:50.100
So I worked in the film
business for about 10 years,

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:52.170
and then I wrote books
for about 10 years.

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:56.390
And at the end of
that sort of run,

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:58.170
I was bored with writing books.

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:01.280
I was bored with
writing normal books.

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:05.300
And then these things
started appearing.

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.400
I think these are
extraordinary devices

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:09.140
that we take for granted.

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:11.100
I hold this thing in
my hand, whether it's

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:15.392
an iPhone or a Nexus device,
whatever smartphone you use.

00:07:15.392 --> 00:07:17.600
And I have all the world's
knowledge at my fingertips

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:18.640
at all times.

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:21.410
I can learn anything
about anything

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:22.770
within about five seconds.

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:26.080
I can see a picture of
any location on Earth

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:27.490
within about five seconds.

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:30.025
I can see a mapping
coordinate, and get directions

00:07:30.025 --> 00:07:32.920
to anywhere on earth
within about five seconds.

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:35.220
I can take pictures.

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:36.500
I can watch videos.

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:37.620
I can play games.

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:38.930
I can call people.

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:40.080
I can text people.

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:43.550
I can engage in social media.

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:45.420
It's an extraordinary thing.

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:49.260
If you went back in time with
this and handed it to somebody,

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.820
they wouldn't
believe it existed.

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:55.160
As a storyteller, I
thought about how could I

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:58.220
start using the technology
embedded within this thing

00:07:58.220 --> 00:07:59.510
to make better stories?

00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:02.380
How could I take a
book and expand it

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:04.790
out using the technology?

00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:08.530
It sounds like a weird
idea, but I sort of

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:10.340
had this idea when
I was searching

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:11.560
for something on Google.

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:14.350
And an odd search
result came up.

00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:18.460
And I thought that would be cool
to somehow link out of a book.

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:19.720
You're reading a book.

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:21.290
You pop a link on
a digital book.

00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:22.790
It takes you to a
search result that

00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:27.510
somehow illuminates whatever
it was you were reading.

00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:31.760
From there, I started thinking
about "Masquerade" again.

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:34.493
I started thinking about a
puzzle embedded within a book.

00:08:34.493 --> 00:08:36.909
And instead of just doing it
within the pages of the book,

00:08:36.909 --> 00:08:39.240
like Kip Williams
did, somehow trying

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:42.039
to do it using all of
these technological tools

00:08:42.039 --> 00:08:46.179
that were now at my
disposal as a storyteller.

00:08:46.179 --> 00:08:48.470
From there, I started thinking
about what kind of story

00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:50.030
could I tell?

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:51.340
What story would work?

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:57.100
What story would be a cool book
that I could use technology

00:08:57.100 --> 00:09:02.360
with that would tell a story,
that could have a puzzle?

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:05.090
And then I started thinking
sort of further than

00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:07.440
that-- that I could build
a mobile game with-- I play

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:11.040
mobile games-- that I
could make movies out of,

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:16.460
that I could build
a universe out of.

00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:18.170
I like conspiracy theories.

00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:20.460
I like aliens.

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:22.710
So I started looking at
a lot of stuff like that.

00:09:25.354 --> 00:09:27.270
What I'll start to tell
you now-- some of it's

00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:28.050
real information.

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:29.010
Some of it's fake.

00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:31.390
I'm a master at
blending those things.

00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:33.220
So I will be very
clear with you when

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:35.860
I'm jumping back and forth.

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:38.820
Real information-- human
beings that look like us

00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:41.040
have existed for 200,000 years.

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:42.900
Human beings that
think like us have only

00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:45.100
existed for 12,000 years.

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:48.760
This was discovered
in 2003, 2004

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:50.700
by the Human Genome Project.

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:52.400
After they fully
decoded the genome,

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:54.060
they started going
backwards in time

00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:57.280
to look at the DNA of people
from different periods of time,

00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:00.550
to see how we had evolved,
if we had evolved at all.

00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:02.390
They reached a point
12,000 years ago

00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:05.420
where something happened to
the genetics of our brain.

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:07.930
Two genes from opposite
ends of the gene spectrum

00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:11.075
were moved and fused, and it
made us significantly smarter

00:10:11.075 --> 00:10:13.700
and greatly enhanced
our cognitive abilities.

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:15.760
There's no explanation for it.

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:19.074
Nobody knows how it
happened or who did it.

00:10:19.074 --> 00:10:20.740
The only thing they've
ever seen like it

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:22.600
is when they genetically
engineer animals

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:24.200
in their own labs.

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:26.270
That's a fact.

00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:28.500
The same time that happened,
all the world's earliest

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:30.340
civilizations were formed.

00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:33.600
They were formed in the
Middle East, in India,

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:36.920
in China, in South America,
in North America-- all at

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:38.510
about the same time.

00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:40.180
All of those earliest
civilizations

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:42.260
were formed around gold mines.

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.400
Nobody has any idea
why this happened.

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:45.940
Gold's not a functional metal.

00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:49.260
You can't make a hammer out
of it or an axe out of it

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:50.600
or a knife out of it.

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:54.370
It's not particularly
rare or hard to get.

00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:56.650
It's beautiful, but there
are other beautiful things

00:10:56.650 --> 00:10:59.410
in the world.

00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:01.050
But all the world's
early civilizations

00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:03.920
were formed around gold mines.

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:05.890
At the same time those
two things happened,

00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:08.470
all of the world's earliest
origin myths were born.

00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:12.080
And they all say almost
identically the same thing,

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:16.110
which is that our omnipotent
creators descended from the sky

00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:20.150
amid smoke and fire, created
humanity, gave us rules

00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:22.120
to live by, and then left.

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:25.370
But before leaving, they told
us someday they would come back.

00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:27.970
And when they did,
the world would end.

00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:31.480
So as a storyteller, I see that
information, which is all real,

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:32.920
and I think it's cool.

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:36.420
And it makes me think, well,
12,000 years ago, aliens

00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:38.960
came to Earth because they
discovered gold was here.

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:41.140
And they needed it,
for whatever reason.

00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:43.070
And they saw these
grunting animals

00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:45.260
that bashed each other
over the heads with sticks,

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:46.990
and they decided to
genetically engineer

00:11:46.990 --> 00:11:49.430
us to make us a little bit
smarter so they could organize

00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:52.490
us into a labor force so
we could dig up their gold.

00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:55.480
When they had the
gold, they took off.

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:59.540
For my fiction I said,
before they took off--

00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:02.650
or for my fiction,
what I have them doing

00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:07.150
is starting 12 original
civilizations around the world.

00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:10.170
The reason I chose
the number 12 is

00:12:10.170 --> 00:12:14.550
because multiple religions and
multiple ancient civilizations

00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:16.250
use that number.

00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:18.490
They use it in the Bible.

00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:20.580
They use it in the Koran.

00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:21.590
They use it in China.

00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:22.880
They use it in Japan.

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:26.640
They all say humanity descended
from 12 original civilizations

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:29.250
or tribes.

00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:33.320
In the book, we use the
oldest civilizations on Earth.

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:36.590
We vary in a very
calculated way.

00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:40.410
We chose ancient civilizations,
but we also chose civilizations

00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:43.433
from all over the world,
so somehow it was balanced.

00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:48.700
And what we say is the aliens
told these civilizations

00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:50.730
that when they
returned, a game would

00:12:50.730 --> 00:12:53.170
be played to determine
the future of humanity

00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:54.620
and that they had
to keep somebody

00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:58.420
under the age of 20 prepared
to play this game at all times.

00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:00.590
So for thousands and
thousands of years,

00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:03.650
these civilizations, all of
which are extinct, all of which

00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:06.830
have vanished, have
actually lived on in secret

00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:09.530
and kept people prepared
to play the game.

00:13:09.530 --> 00:13:11.650
In the book, we say that
a lot of the world's

00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:14.510
secret societies-- things like
the Brotherhood of the Snake

00:13:14.510 --> 00:13:17.030
or the Illuminati
or the Rosicrucians

00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:20.130
or the Priory of Sion--
are, in fact, real.

00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:22.790
But they are not devoted
to world domination.

00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:24.330
They're devoted
to keeping players

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:27.110
prepared to play Endgame.

00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:29.999
All the players knew, all
the civilizations knew,

00:13:29.999 --> 00:13:31.540
was that the game
would be kicked off

00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:33.520
by a celestial event.

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:34.810
So they waited.

00:13:34.810 --> 00:13:37.070
At the beginning
of the first book,

00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:40.080
12 asteroids simultaneously
hit Earth's surface.

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:42.560
They do trillions of
dollars of damage and kill

00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:43.984
millions of people.

00:13:43.984 --> 00:13:45.650
Most people on Earth
think it's a fluke,

00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:50.400
except for these players, who
know that Endgame just started.

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:52.760
Switch back to real
information for a second.

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:54.210
There's a pyramid in China.

00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:57.560
It's called the Great
White Pyramid of Xian.

00:13:57.560 --> 00:14:00.060
It is built to the precise
dimensions of the Great Pyramid

00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:02.820
at Giza, except it's
three times larger.

00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:04.710
They know at one point
the pyramid at Giza

00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:07.889
was covered with white limestone
and had a gold cap on it.

00:14:07.889 --> 00:14:10.305
The pyramid in China is still
covered with white limestone

00:14:10.305 --> 00:14:12.240
and has a gold cap on it.

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:14.220
Chinese government doesn't
let anyone near it--

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:16.300
doesn't let anybody
within 100 miles of it.

00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:18.449
Last time it was
seen was in 1945,

00:14:18.449 --> 00:14:20.282
when US fighter pilots
flew over it and took

00:14:20.282 --> 00:14:21.392
a bunch of pictures of it.

00:14:21.392 --> 00:14:23.225
If you Google that,
you'll see the pictures.

00:14:25.577 --> 00:14:27.160
The Chinese government
doesn't discuss

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:28.675
why they don't let
anybody near it

00:14:28.675 --> 00:14:31.120
or what they think
happens there.

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:33.240
They just don't.

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:35.180
In the book, the players
go to this pyramid,

00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:38.200
where they're met by an
alien, who tells them

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:40.720
that Endgame is the
hunt for three keys,

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:43.230
that three keys have been
hidden around the world.

00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:45.180
They have to be found in order.

00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:46.700
And the first
player to physically

00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:49.550
possess those three
keys wins the game.

00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:52.730
What they win is the
apocalypse is coming,

00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:56.260
and the slice of humanity
descended from the winner's

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:59.370
civilization will survive
the impending apocalypse.

00:14:59.370 --> 00:15:01.335
Everybody on Earth
is going to die.

00:15:01.335 --> 00:15:04.420
Does that all make sense?

00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:06.630
So I have that story framework.

00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:08.260
I have a story
that I think works,

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:11.340
that I think is cool, that
blends real information

00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:15.330
with fictional information,
and that gives me a framework

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:19.550
to build what I call a 21st
century book, or a 21st century

00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:22.170
entertainment
franchise-- a puzzle,

00:15:22.170 --> 00:15:27.420
a mobile game, a series of
movies and television shows,

00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:32.010
novellas, social
media-- almost limitless

00:15:32.010 --> 00:15:35.010
what we could do with it.

00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:36.704
From there I wrote the book.

00:15:36.704 --> 00:15:38.870
I knew there was going to
be a ton of labor involved

00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:42.400
in doing this project, more than
anything I'd ever done before.

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:44.650
So I found a friend of mine
to write the book with me.

00:15:44.650 --> 00:15:49.860
I wrote a 30-page outline
in a 50-page sort of Bible,

00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:51.170
handed it to him.

00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:54.450
He wrote the first
draft of the book.

00:15:54.450 --> 00:15:58.110
From there, I rewrote
the book three times.

00:15:58.110 --> 00:15:59.880
And the book was finished.

00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:04.210
The book was finished about two
and a half, three years ago.

00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:06.960
Once the book was finished,
it was, OK, how do I do this?

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:08.850
And I had written out
how I wanted to do it

00:16:08.850 --> 00:16:10.920
in this sort of Bible document.

00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:14.170
And the first partner
I wanted to get

00:16:14.170 --> 00:16:17.080
was Google, for a
variety of reasons.

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:20.070
One of them because
I had seen "Ingress."

00:16:20.070 --> 00:16:20.960
I hadn't seen it.

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:24.070
I had heard of it and read
about it and knew what it was,

00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:26.460
and it very much
matched up with my idea

00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:29.170
of how to make a mobile
version of "Endgame."

00:16:29.170 --> 00:16:32.060
B, when I wanted to build
the puzzle for the book,

00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:34.190
I wanted to be use
Google's App Engines

00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:35.800
for a variety of reasons.

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:37.847
But I also wanted
to use Google itself

00:16:37.847 --> 00:16:40.430
and build a book that, when you
read it, you're reading along.

00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:44.650
And you'll come-- in a physical
book, it's a footnoted word.

00:16:44.650 --> 00:16:47.230
In a digital book, it's
a hyperlinked word.

00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:49.910
And you click it, and it
would take you out somewhere

00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:52.970
into Google, to a Google search
result, to a YouTube video,

00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:56.060
to a Google map location,
to a Google Earth location,

00:16:56.060 --> 00:17:02.320
to a book fragment, to a field
trip excursion-- a book that,

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:04.720
when you read it, the
same way "Masquerade"

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:06.599
took me out of it into
a different world,

00:17:06.599 --> 00:17:08.760
took you out of it
into a different world,

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:13.050
and used all of these things--
search results, YouTube videos,

00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:17.700
locations-- as a way to
enhance the story and deepen

00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:22.760
the story-- social media
accounts, Google+ profiles.

00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:25.680
I called John, or my
agent called John.

00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:27.800
He works up in San
Francisco, I work

00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:30.370
in New York and
Connecticut, so we met here.

00:17:30.370 --> 00:17:33.470
We had a one-hour meeting
scheduled originally,

00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:36.187
that turned into a three or
four-hour conversation with him

00:17:36.187 --> 00:17:37.770
and a couple of the
guys-- who I think

00:17:37.770 --> 00:17:40.370
are in this room-- who
work on "Ingress," a couple

00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:41.760
of the story puzzle guys.

00:17:44.164 --> 00:17:45.580
And from there,
it was, all right,

00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:47.020
how do we start building this?

00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:49.830
It was remarkable meeting
John because, like he said,

00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:52.510
we were thinking about
exactly the same things

00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:54.340
but from different
points of view.

00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:56.460
He's a technologist.

00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:58.510
He knows how to build
things and do things

00:17:58.510 --> 00:18:03.050
that I don't and that are way
beyond any version of what

00:18:03.050 --> 00:18:05.330
my brain can do.

00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:07.040
But I knew how to
do things he didn't.

00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:08.420
I know how to tell stories.

00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:11.490
I know how to set up
entertainment deals.

00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:14.040
I know how to make movies
and television shows.

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:17.010
And in many ways, it
was a perfect marriage

00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:20.600
of complementary skills.

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:23.652
From there, we started working
on the game and the puzzle.

00:18:23.652 --> 00:18:25.360
I'm not smart enough
to write the puzzle,

00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:28.740
so I hired a couple
guys with PhDs from MIT

00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:30.130
to write the puzzle.

00:18:30.130 --> 00:18:33.980
We built the puzzle, which
exists exactly like I always

00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:37.230
conceived of it-- in a
variety of places on Google

00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:40.240
and then about 100
to 150 websites

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:44.960
that are all built and linked
using Google's App Engines.

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:46.970
And we started building
the mobile game.

00:18:46.970 --> 00:18:49.190
And just like "Ingress,"
if you play "Ingress"--

00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:52.680
and I would imagine-- how
many of you play "Ingress"?

00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:54.610
A lot of you play "Ingress."

00:18:54.610 --> 00:18:57.380
The thing about "Ingress"
that snapped for me

00:18:57.380 --> 00:19:00.860
is, I was talking about a book
being a static experience.

00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:03.750
Most video games are
also a static experience.

00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:07.070
It's you get a game, you
sit in front of a screen,

00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:08.170
and you don't move.

00:19:08.170 --> 00:19:12.620
You engage the game on a screen,
and that's where it exists.

00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:15.910
If it goes anywhere,
it goes to a place

00:19:15.910 --> 00:19:18.820
where you might interact
with other players

00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:21.010
in different parts
of the world online.

00:19:21.010 --> 00:19:24.510
But it's still a static,
non-moving experience.

00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:27.580
My idea was, for
"Endgame," how do we turn

00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:29.520
the world into a video game?

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:34.650
How do we build a game that
you can play everywhere you go,

00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:36.400
that you don't play
sitting on your couch?

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:38.525
You play when you're walking
to school, when you're

00:19:38.525 --> 00:19:40.680
going to the grocery
store, when you're sitting

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:43.870
at a stoplight in
a car, when you're

00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:46.760
in a line to get your
driver's license-- whatever.

00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:49.020
How do we turn the
world into a video game?

00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:51.670
And that's essentially what
they were doing with "Ingress."

00:19:51.670 --> 00:19:56.550
They figured out a way to
make a game that forced people

00:19:56.550 --> 00:20:00.100
to get up off their ass and
go do stuff and interact

00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:04.887
with each other and play against
each other and choose a team.

00:20:04.887 --> 00:20:06.470
And on top of that,
they were building

00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:09.330
fiction that went
along with that game

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:11.530
and went along with that idea.

00:20:11.530 --> 00:20:13.340
So not only are you
getting up off your ass

00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:15.740
to play a game that you
can do everywhere you

00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:19.630
go, there's an ongoing story
that lets you interact with it,

00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:23.160
that lets you participate in
it, that lets you choose a side

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:25.320
and have a team and
work with other people

00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:28.050
to win or lose while
playing the game.

00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:34.660
It's the future, absolutely.

00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:36.550
You know, the technology
lets us do this.

00:20:36.550 --> 00:20:39.150
So John and I started
talking about, OK,

00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:41.350
how do we do it with "Endgame"?

00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:45.920
How do we take lessons
learned from "Ingress"

00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:48.440
and apply them to "Endgame"
while also making it

00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:52.050
something different and
new and more exciting,

00:20:52.050 --> 00:20:56.860
hopefully-- not that
"Ingress" isn't exciting.

00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:59.460
And we spent a long
time talking about it.

00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:01.280
He started hiring people.

00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:04.510
From there, I took the
book out to publishers.

00:21:04.510 --> 00:21:11.050
We sold it to 35
publishers in 34 languages.

00:21:11.050 --> 00:21:12.800
When it was released,
it was the largest

00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:15.562
simultaneous publication
of a book in history.

00:21:15.562 --> 00:21:21.160
It came out in 34 languages and
165 countries on the same day.

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:24.160
We built the puzzle.

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:26.260
The puzzle was
enormously complicated,

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:30.760
not only in its conception and
execution, both on the page

00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:35.705
and off the page, but
incredibly complicated legally.

00:21:35.705 --> 00:21:37.580
We had to figure out
how to do something that

00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:40.045
was legal in 165 countries.

00:21:43.650 --> 00:21:47.050
And then from there, once we
had the publishers, the puzzle,

00:21:47.050 --> 00:21:50.290
and John's team working on the
game, and John's hiring people

00:21:50.290 --> 00:21:56.500
to build out a team even bigger,
we sold the movie rights.

00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:58.450
20th Century Fox
bought the movie rights

00:21:58.450 --> 00:22:00.520
in the biggest rights
acquisition deal

00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:03.660
in the studio's long history.

00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:07.474
The producers are a
group of two men who

00:22:07.474 --> 00:22:08.640
call themselves Temple Hill.

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:10.060
They made all the
"Twilight" movies.

00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:11.518
They made "The
Fault in Our Stars."

00:22:11.518 --> 00:22:12.640
They made "Maze Runner."

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:16.070
They're old, old
buddies of mine.

00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:18.190
And now this
actually might work.

00:22:18.190 --> 00:22:19.730
We have a book.

00:22:19.730 --> 00:22:21.550
The book came out in October.

00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:23.634
It hit the best seller
list in 12 languages

00:22:23.634 --> 00:22:24.550
in about 30 countries.

00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:29.480
A book that's going
to be a game that's

00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:33.716
going to be a movie that
will have ongoing-- it

00:22:33.716 --> 00:22:35.590
will have fiction that
we write in the books.

00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:38.700
But just like "Ingress," it
will have ongoing fiction

00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:41.955
and new puzzles that allow
the readers and the gamers

00:22:41.955 --> 00:22:44.670
to interact with the
characters, to feel

00:22:44.670 --> 00:22:46.630
like they're participating
in it, to help

00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:48.430
us shape where it goes.

00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:52.120
Right now the books and the
ARG fiction are separate.

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:54.640
But we've been working
a lot to fuse them.

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:57.290
So in the next book, which
comes out next October,

00:22:57.290 --> 00:22:58.344
they'll start to fuse.

00:22:58.344 --> 00:23:00.260
And then by the time the
third book comes out,

00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:04.850
the October after that,
it will be fully fused.

00:23:04.850 --> 00:23:06.510
And what I think we
believe we're doing

00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:10.780
is building the future
of entertainment,

00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:14.110
of books and of
gaming and of films

00:23:14.110 --> 00:23:17.410
and of how those things
are-- instead of allowing

00:23:17.410 --> 00:23:18.910
them to happen accidentally.

00:23:18.910 --> 00:23:20.550
And when I say
accidentally, you look

00:23:20.550 --> 00:23:22.930
at something like Harry Potter.

00:23:22.930 --> 00:23:25.690
They didn't plan for Harry
Potter to be what was.

00:23:25.690 --> 00:23:28.310
It happened, it came
out, it exploded,

00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:30.390
and then they built a
whole world around it

00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:32.500
after its success.

00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:34.470
My idea from the
beginning of this

00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:38.360
was that we could create that
world from the beginning,

00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:40.800
and people would come
to it-- that instead

00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:44.544
of waiting to see what happened,
we build it and they come.

00:23:44.544 --> 00:23:45.710
And that's what we're doing.

00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:50.990
It's been crazy
exciting, a ton of work,

00:23:50.990 --> 00:23:53.490
not too stressful,
actually, because you get up

00:23:53.490 --> 00:23:55.440
excited and kind of
scared every day,

00:23:55.440 --> 00:24:00.220
which is what I think the best
way to feel about your job is.

00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:04.170
Yeah, and it's been amazing.

00:24:04.170 --> 00:24:06.319
I get to work with
a ton of people

00:24:06.319 --> 00:24:07.860
who are a lot smarter
than me and who

00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:12.004
know a lot more about
things that I don't know.

00:24:12.004 --> 00:24:13.670
And I think it's
actually going to work.

00:24:13.670 --> 00:24:16.292
I think we're going
to pull it off.

00:24:16.292 --> 00:24:16.875
Any questions?

00:24:19.890 --> 00:24:20.680
No questions?

00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:23.856
All you smart people
and no questions?

00:24:23.856 --> 00:24:27.349
AUDIENCE: This sounds amazing.

00:24:27.349 --> 00:24:29.345
I was so excited to
come in this morning.

00:24:29.345 --> 00:24:30.343
This is great.

00:24:30.343 --> 00:24:32.838
My question for you is,
how much of a leap of faith

00:24:32.838 --> 00:24:34.834
was it when you
started this project?

00:24:34.834 --> 00:24:36.930
Because with a
Harry Potter book,

00:24:36.930 --> 00:24:39.375
you start out with a book.

00:24:39.375 --> 00:24:41.045
You work with a
publisher to publish it,

00:24:41.045 --> 00:24:42.795
and then it just kind
of grows from there.

00:24:42.795 --> 00:24:45.306
So you have a basis of success.

00:24:45.306 --> 00:24:47.472
With something like "Endgame,"
it's a great concept.

00:24:47.472 --> 00:24:50.970
But it sounds to me you had
to employ a lot of people

00:24:50.970 --> 00:24:54.020
from the get-go to
sign onto this project

00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:58.055
before it could ever
be fiscally feasible.

00:24:58.055 --> 00:25:01.090
So if you could talk a
little bit about the business

00:25:01.090 --> 00:25:03.837
aspect of it in addition
to the creative aspect.

00:25:03.837 --> 00:25:06.170
JAMES FREY: I mean, really
it was just convincing people

00:25:06.170 --> 00:25:08.880
that my vision was possible.

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:12.800
It was getting into
rooms with people

00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:15.730
who could make this
thing a reality

00:25:15.730 --> 00:25:21.160
and convincing them that
it was possible to do.

00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:24.390
One thing I did was,
the book was done.

00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:28.080
And there was a sort of
controlling plan document.

00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:30.090
So I wasn't just coming
in and saying, well,

00:25:30.090 --> 00:25:31.250
this is what I want to do.

00:25:31.250 --> 00:25:32.160
You want to do it?

00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:34.630
I could say, this is
what I want to do.

00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:36.780
Here is the plan very precisely.

00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:38.570
Here's what I need.

00:25:38.570 --> 00:25:42.450
Here's what I would like to
do with you specifically.

00:25:42.450 --> 00:25:43.514
And here's the book.

00:25:43.514 --> 00:25:44.180
You can read it.

00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:51.480
I mean, people took
real leaps of faith.

00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:55.770
I mean, I was convincing
people to spend real money

00:25:55.770 --> 00:25:59.460
and put in real work.

00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:05.630
And I don't know what to
say other than that I think

00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:07.320
a lot of-- I didn't
know John, but I

00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:09.050
knew everybody else I went to.

00:26:09.050 --> 00:26:10.890
I had worked with them before.

00:26:10.890 --> 00:26:13.140
HarperCollins published the
book in the United States.

00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:18.140
They published one of my adult
novels before and about 40

00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:19.530
of my company's books.

00:26:19.530 --> 00:26:22.930
So it's a very longstanding,
stable, productive

00:26:22.930 --> 00:26:24.520
relationship.

00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:26.900
Marty and Wick, the
movie producers,

00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:29.950
are guys-- Marty used to be
one of my agents 15 years ago.

00:26:29.950 --> 00:26:31.841
And they're guys I've
known since I first

00:26:31.841 --> 00:26:33.840
started writing movies
out here a long time ago.

00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:34.590
I worked for Wick.

00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:44.810
And then as far as
making deals, I always

00:26:44.810 --> 00:26:47.300
say, like, just look at
what the greater good is.

00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:49.570
I'm not going to fight
you and bitch and moan

00:26:49.570 --> 00:26:51.240
about a little deal point.

00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:54.190
The idea is to make this
happen-- to prove it out.

00:26:54.190 --> 00:26:57.420
And if we can make it happen and
we prove it out and it works,

00:26:57.420 --> 00:27:01.320
everybody's going to be
very happy financially.

00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:06.910
But that if I get hung
up over stupid bullshit,

00:27:06.910 --> 00:27:09.780
I put it in jeopardy.

00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:11.640
When you make a
partnership with anybody,

00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:13.765
whether it's a business
partnership or a friendship

00:27:13.765 --> 00:27:16.300
or a marriage or whatever,
you take a leap of faith.

00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:19.590
And for me, I don't need
to control everything.

00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:21.600
I don't have to be in
charge of everything.

00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:24.280
You have to believe in the
people you're working with

00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:27.650
or you're in partnership with.

00:27:27.650 --> 00:27:31.400
And if I've done anything
well on this project,

00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:33.600
it's choose great partners.

00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:39.770
Like, I think the guys,
John and Dan and Jim,

00:27:39.770 --> 00:27:42.410
the whole team here at
Google-- I always am

00:27:42.410 --> 00:27:44.580
super-excited when I come here.

00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:48.070
A, because the
cafeteria fucking rocks.

00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:52.690
B, because I get all the
free Coke Zero I want.

00:27:52.690 --> 00:27:56.110
But C, because I
walk in, and I know

00:27:56.110 --> 00:27:59.010
I'm going to spend my day with
people-- and I don't say this,

00:27:59.010 --> 00:28:01.820
like, jokingly or
in a corny way.

00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:04.580
I'm going to work with people
who I really, truly believe

00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:07.790
are smarter than me and who
are awesome at their jobs.

00:28:07.790 --> 00:28:10.470
They're the best people in
the world at their jobs.

00:28:10.470 --> 00:28:12.730
And we're doing
exciting, fun stuff.

00:28:12.730 --> 00:28:15.650
And every time I come-- it's
not like I'm here every day.

00:28:15.650 --> 00:28:18.690
Every time I come, there's
something new happening.

00:28:18.690 --> 00:28:22.840
They have something new to show
me, something new to tell me.

00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:27.720
And I would be a fool and a
madman to walk in here and try

00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:31.420
to tell them that I
know more than them,

00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:32.720
because I just don't.

00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:34.920
You work with the
best people you can

00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:37.539
and you let them do their
job and you trust them.

00:28:37.539 --> 00:28:39.580
And then honestly, you
let them know how much you

00:28:39.580 --> 00:28:40.788
appreciate working with them.

00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:43.955
It's been great.

00:28:43.955 --> 00:28:45.330
The partners have
all been great.

00:28:45.330 --> 00:28:46.790
We do events together
all the time.

00:28:46.790 --> 00:28:49.920
We did-- me, John, and Marty
Bone did an event last night.

00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:52.580
We've done events all
over the place together.

00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:54.100
Always a pleasure
to see everybody.

00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:55.680
I'm always stoked.

00:28:55.680 --> 00:29:00.074
And like I said, I get
up excited most days.

00:29:00.074 --> 00:29:02.494
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:02.494 --> 00:29:04.430
But my question
is, were you aware

00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:06.366
that there was
scandal surrounding

00:29:06.366 --> 00:29:08.011
the end of "Masquerade?"

00:29:08.011 --> 00:29:10.510
JAMES FREY: Was I aware that
there was a scandal surrounding

00:29:10.510 --> 00:29:11.509
the end of "Masquerade"?

00:29:11.509 --> 00:29:12.580
I was.

00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:14.910
So the scandal surrounding
the end of "Masquerade"

00:29:14.910 --> 00:29:20.380
was that the winner of the
prize was the new boyfriend

00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:22.575
of the author's ex-girlfriend.

00:29:22.575 --> 00:29:25.440
Does that make sense?

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:29.930
So clearly, there was some kind
of inside shit going on there.

00:29:29.930 --> 00:29:32.650
One of the things we did
with "Endgame" was we

00:29:32.650 --> 00:29:34.430
went to great
lengths to make sure

00:29:34.430 --> 00:29:36.260
that that was not possible.

00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:40.340
I don't know where
the key is hidden.

00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:44.080
The way the puzzle works, Matt
[? Lebowitz ?] and his team,

00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:47.250
which is sometimes three
people and sometimes

00:29:47.250 --> 00:29:49.970
20 people-- I'm never
sure how many he

00:29:49.970 --> 00:29:55.050
has working for him at any
given time-- built the puzzle.

00:29:55.050 --> 00:29:58.940
Matt knows the solution to the
puzzle, and one of my attorneys

00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:01.170
knows the solution
to the puzzle.

00:30:01.170 --> 00:30:03.300
Nobody else does.

00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:07.030
The way the actual
mechanics of the puzzle work

00:30:07.030 --> 00:30:11.610
is, when you solve one of the
first puzzles in the books,

00:30:11.610 --> 00:30:14.370
it will take you
one of two websites.

00:30:14.370 --> 00:30:16.810
Once you're there, you sign in.

00:30:16.810 --> 00:30:18.410
You have to have
a Google account.

00:30:18.410 --> 00:30:22.700
So if you don't have a Gmail
address, you have to start one.

00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:24.340
You accept our privacy policy.

00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:26.910
You accept our rules.

00:30:26.910 --> 00:30:29.950
From there, part of
our privacy policy

00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:31.800
allows us to track
you everywhere

00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:35.310
you go-- only when you're
engaged in our websites

00:30:35.310 --> 00:30:37.530
or engaged in the puzzle.

00:30:37.530 --> 00:30:40.770
So if you're on a puzzle website
trying to solve a puzzle,

00:30:40.770 --> 00:30:41.802
we know where you are.

00:30:41.802 --> 00:30:43.260
We know how long
you've been there.

00:30:43.260 --> 00:30:45.630
We know what you're doing.

00:30:45.630 --> 00:30:47.850
We can do that with
every player on Earth.

00:30:47.850 --> 00:30:52.190
Last I checked, there were
players or people actively

00:30:52.190 --> 00:30:54.540
working to solve the
puzzle from 104 countries,

00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:56.520
and over 100,000
people had solved

00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:58.660
the first entry-level
puzzle and are working.

00:30:58.660 --> 00:31:02.700
There was a group of, let's
say, 20,000 people who spend

00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:05.500
multiple hours a day on it.

00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:08.470
And there was a group of
about 10 who were in the lead.

00:31:08.470 --> 00:31:12.240
But we will know where they
are, what they're doing,

00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:14.700
and we will know
when somebody wins.

00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:17.760
When somebody solves it, there
will be one person who does it.

00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:18.930
We'll be able to prove it.

00:31:18.930 --> 00:31:21.480
We'll be able to print out
an entire record of how they

00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:24.430
got there, how long it took
them, what steps they took,

00:31:24.430 --> 00:31:28.960
in order to both
prove that it was fair

00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:30.390
and ensure that it was fair.

00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:36.100
And people ask me all the
time, like, where's the key?

00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:37.030
I don't know.

00:31:37.030 --> 00:31:39.353
For a while, I actually
had the key in my wallet.

00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:46.240
For the first three weeks
after the book came out,

00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:48.457
the whole puzzle was
built, but we knew,

00:31:48.457 --> 00:31:50.540
or we believed nobody would
solve it that quickly.

00:31:50.540 --> 00:31:53.530
So I was walking around
with this key in my wallet.

00:31:53.530 --> 00:31:56.180
And I would pull it out
at events, and be like,

00:31:56.180 --> 00:31:57.500
here's the fucking key.

00:32:00.141 --> 00:32:02.140
And I'm not sure-- I don't
know if you guys were

00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:03.140
at any of those events.

00:32:03.140 --> 00:32:06.980
I'm not sure if people believed
me or not, but it was the key.

00:32:06.980 --> 00:32:10.030
Once you find the key,
the gold, the prize

00:32:10.030 --> 00:32:13.850
is $500,000 for the first
book-- $500,000 in gold.

00:32:13.850 --> 00:32:15.680
For the second book,
it will be $1 million.

00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:18.450
For the third book,
it'll be $1.5 million.

00:32:18.450 --> 00:32:20.620
The gold is in a
bulletproof case

00:32:20.620 --> 00:32:23.910
bolted to the floor of
Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas.

00:32:23.910 --> 00:32:27.590
So when you find the key, you
will go to Caesar's Palace.

00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:30.250
You'll open that case.

00:32:30.250 --> 00:32:33.430
It's actually hydraulic, so you
put the key in, you turn it,

00:32:33.430 --> 00:32:35.200
and the hydraulic
case will lift up.

00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:36.885
And you get to
sweep away the gold,

00:32:36.885 --> 00:32:38.925
and do whatever
you want with it.

00:32:42.270 --> 00:32:44.230
AUDIENCE: Is it
going to be taxed?

00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:51.090
JAMES FREY: That's actually
a very valid question,

00:32:51.090 --> 00:32:52.440
and one we had to deal with.

00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:54.530
And in the rules
of the game, we say

00:32:54.530 --> 00:32:58.070
we are not responsible
for you, your taxes,

00:32:58.070 --> 00:33:01.140
or your interactions with the
government of your country

00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:05.420
in any way whatsoever, that once
the golden moves physically out

00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:07.070
of the case into
your possession,

00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:09.320
it is your business.

00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:11.040
If you happen to win
it, I would highly

00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:14.610
advise you pay your taxes.

00:33:14.610 --> 00:33:18.050
But it's got nothing
to do with me.

00:33:18.050 --> 00:33:20.098
AUDIENCE: When do you
expect someone to win it?

00:33:20.098 --> 00:33:21.764
It sounds like you're
expecting a winner

00:33:21.764 --> 00:33:23.860
before the next book comes out.

00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:27.280
JAMES FREY: We
don't really know.

00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:31.680
We wanted to design
the puzzle so

00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:35.010
that it took approximately
10 to 12 months for somebody

00:33:35.010 --> 00:33:36.410
to solve it.

00:33:36.410 --> 00:33:39.730
It's, again, one of those
things you can't really control.

00:33:39.730 --> 00:33:42.920
You can build it in a way that
you think will take that long,

00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:45.580
but you can't control it.

00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:48.930
Right now, it's on track
to happen somewhere

00:33:48.930 --> 00:33:49.735
within that window.

00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:57.040
Right out of the gate, people
were slightly ahead of pace.

00:33:57.040 --> 00:34:00.120
Then people fell
slightly behind pace.

00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:01.910
Right now, I think
they're right on pace.

00:34:01.910 --> 00:34:04.330
I think it'll get solved
in August or September

00:34:04.330 --> 00:34:05.830
of next year,
which will be right

00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:09.150
before the next book comes out.

00:34:09.150 --> 00:34:10.679
But I don't know.

00:34:10.679 --> 00:34:13.699
I know nobody's solved it
yet, which makes me happy.

00:34:13.699 --> 00:34:15.127
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] next book.

00:34:15.127 --> 00:34:16.960
JAMES FREY: Yeah, we're
not stupid that way.

00:34:20.540 --> 00:34:22.788
Couple more.

00:34:22.788 --> 00:34:26.370
AUDIENCE: Is it
hard to catch up?

00:34:26.370 --> 00:34:28.520
JAMES FREY: It's not
actually hard to catch up,

00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:30.350
I don't think.

00:34:30.350 --> 00:34:32.300
I mean, I haven't done it.

00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:35.300
I'm not trying to solve it.

00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:37.910
As part of the rules,
I can't win it, so--

00:34:37.910 --> 00:34:41.719
and I'm also busy enough that
I don't have the time to do it.

00:34:41.719 --> 00:34:45.002
But I think it's
possible to catch up.

00:34:45.002 --> 00:34:47.200
I know people are
sharing information.

00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:53.682
And I think it's
possible to catch up.

00:34:53.682 --> 00:34:55.586
AUDIENCE: Will the game
that's being built,

00:34:55.586 --> 00:34:59.320
will that be part
of finding the key?

00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:00.110
JAMES FREY: No.

00:35:00.110 --> 00:35:02.210
We talked about that early on.

00:35:02.210 --> 00:35:05.400
But legally it was
way too complicated.

00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:10.710
One company needed to take
responsibility for the puzzle.

00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:16.940
I don't think Google wanted
to indemnify either me

00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:19.560
or the puzzle builders.

00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:22.940
Google didn't become Google
because the people running

00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:25.300
it are stupid.

00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:28.550
So we talked about that
very, very early on.

00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:32.140
But it was way too complicated
to do for a variety of reasons.

00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:36.990
So no, but there
are still puzzles

00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:40.230
that are part of the ARG
fiction related to the game that

00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:42.300
are totally awesome,
in that you can

00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:43.950
go in and try to solve them.

00:35:43.950 --> 00:35:46.910
And once the game comes out,
when you solve those puzzles,

00:35:46.910 --> 00:35:48.570
it'll give you
rewards in the game.

00:35:48.570 --> 00:35:51.840
It'll give you better
weapons, or better armor,

00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:53.650
or better skills.

00:35:53.650 --> 00:35:56.090
So there will be puzzles in
the game that provide you

00:35:56.090 --> 00:35:59.200
with rewards but not
clues to the puzzle that

00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:01.844
wins you the money.

00:36:01.844 --> 00:36:06.128
AUDIENCE: In the game, do you
get to create a character--

00:36:06.128 --> 00:36:09.389
did you put a character
in Endgame, so--

00:36:09.389 --> 00:36:10.180
JAMES FREY: You do.

00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:11.580
You get to choose a line.

00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:12.860
And you have a username.

00:36:12.860 --> 00:36:16.720
And you get to choose what
your character's wearing.

00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:18.220
And you get to go
out on missions,

00:36:18.220 --> 00:36:22.100
sort of like "Ingress," and
find the weapons you want.

00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:25.980
And then you get to go
do battle with people.

00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:30.080
They showed us an animation
of the game yesterday,

00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:31.507
of one of the battles happening.

00:36:31.507 --> 00:36:32.840
It's going to be pretty awesome.

00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:35.670
It's going to be really cool.

00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:37.350
AUDIENCE: So with
your friends, you

00:36:37.350 --> 00:36:41.410
could make alliances
and then go [INAUDIBLE]?

00:36:41.410 --> 00:36:43.010
JAMES FREY: You can.

00:36:43.010 --> 00:36:45.110
Like, in a few
months, the two of you

00:36:45.110 --> 00:36:46.940
will be able to
make an alliance.

00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:49.490
And if there's some
11-year-old boy in your class

00:36:49.490 --> 00:36:54.890
you don't like-- and
he's really annoying,

00:36:54.890 --> 00:36:57.570
and he's also playing
"Endgame," the two

00:36:57.570 --> 00:37:02.470
of you will be able to gang
up on him and take him out.

00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:04.490
And if and when you
do that, you have

00:37:04.490 --> 00:37:07.027
to send your dad an email so
that he can send it to me,

00:37:07.027 --> 00:37:08.360
because I want to hear about it.

00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:17.138
AUDIENCE: So we were talking
about a book being [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:17.138 --> 00:37:22.048
something that's more not
just unbounded from the page,

00:37:22.048 --> 00:37:24.770
but I think also unbounded
from the-- part of a book

00:37:24.770 --> 00:37:26.249
is you lock yourself in.

00:37:26.249 --> 00:37:28.714
You get all the creative
vision out into it.

00:37:28.714 --> 00:37:31.644
And I think with ARGs and
things like that, you're

00:37:31.644 --> 00:37:33.644
dealing with the way it
interacts with the world

00:37:33.644 --> 00:37:35.123
and how that
affects the back end

00:37:35.123 --> 00:37:37.095
and the cycle of creativity.

00:37:37.095 --> 00:37:40.053
Has that come into play
within "Endgame" yet?

00:37:40.053 --> 00:37:42.025
Are you seeing interaction
having that feedback

00:37:42.025 --> 00:37:43.011
into the future?

00:37:43.011 --> 00:37:44.020
If not--

00:37:44.020 --> 00:37:47.830
JAMES FREY: It has not,
but we believe it will.

00:37:47.830 --> 00:37:51.600
And we're sort of
planning for it to.

00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:53.640
One of the things with
the ARG and the book

00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:58.140
is the first book was done and
was on a publication schedule

00:37:58.140 --> 00:38:01.190
before we even started
any of the ARG fiction.

00:38:01.190 --> 00:38:05.730
So there's no way we can reverse
engineer it back into it.

00:38:05.730 --> 00:38:08.440
There have been a
lot of conversations

00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:11.310
and a lot of emails
about book two.

00:38:11.310 --> 00:38:13.410
And there's a draft of book two.

00:38:13.410 --> 00:38:15.410
There's a pretty tight
working draft of book two

00:38:15.410 --> 00:38:19.890
about how to integrate the
ARG fiction into the book.

00:38:19.890 --> 00:38:21.840
And so in book two,
like I said, there

00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:25.065
will be a lot of-- the
characters from the ARG

00:38:25.065 --> 00:38:26.785
are starting to
appear in the book.

00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:34.910
By the time book three has to be
finished, the ARG and the game

00:38:34.910 --> 00:38:35.500
will be out.

00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:37.280
And there will be
real participation,

00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:39.160
we hope and believe.

00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:40.460
And there'll be real feedback.

00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:43.140
And we'll be able to
integrate it far more into it.

00:38:43.140 --> 00:38:45.270
The other thing is,
we can do novellas.

00:38:45.270 --> 00:38:49.600
We have eight novellas
finished right now.

00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:52.370
But we can produce novellas
very, very quickly.

00:38:52.370 --> 00:38:54.040
And so part of the
idea is that we'll

00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:56.770
be able to produce
novellas within, let's say,

00:38:56.770 --> 00:38:59.870
two to four weeks of events
in the game happening.

00:38:59.870 --> 00:39:01.760
And because with a
novella we're not

00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:05.370
tied to a traditional
physical publishing schedule,

00:39:05.370 --> 00:39:08.580
if an event happens in
the game and the ARG,

00:39:08.580 --> 00:39:09.944
we can pop out a novella.

00:39:09.944 --> 00:39:11.360
And we can publish
it immediately.

00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:17.600
So fans and players
and readers will

00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:22.922
be able to get material in ways
that they never have before.

00:39:22.922 --> 00:39:25.130
And part of that is because
we built a system to be--

00:39:25.130 --> 00:39:28.250
or my company built a system--
to be able to produce material

00:39:28.250 --> 00:39:29.880
that quickly and efficiently.

00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:32.040
And digital publishing
lets us do it.

00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:34.820
Once we have a
manuscript done, it's

00:39:34.820 --> 00:39:36.850
maybe three, four
hours to format it

00:39:36.850 --> 00:39:38.646
into the proper files.

00:39:38.646 --> 00:39:40.270
We already have all
the accounts set up

00:39:40.270 --> 00:39:46.720
with all the digital
distributors-- Google, Apple,

00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:48.340
Amazon, Barnes and Noble.

00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:51.350
It's just a matter of setting
up a page for the novella

00:39:51.350 --> 00:39:52.400
and releasing it.

00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:53.970
So there will be a lot of that.

00:39:53.970 --> 00:39:56.510
That's one of the most exciting
parts of this whole thing

00:39:56.510 --> 00:40:00.500
is we'll be doing
storytelling in real time

00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:05.500
with technology in ways that
nobody's ever done it before.

00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:08.959
It's one of the exciting
parts and scary parts.

00:40:08.959 --> 00:40:10.250
But that's definitely the plan.

00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:13.820
One more question?

00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:14.611
Two more questions?

00:40:17.570 --> 00:40:21.352
All right, I've
silenced the Googlers.

00:40:21.352 --> 00:40:22.810
AUDIENCE: So in
the game, it sounds

00:40:22.810 --> 00:40:23.890
like you have to choose a line.

00:40:23.890 --> 00:40:24.598
JAMES FREY: Yeah.

00:40:24.598 --> 00:40:27.228
AUDIENCE: If you don't choose
the same line as your friends,

00:40:27.228 --> 00:40:29.005
are you going to be
able to play together?

00:40:29.005 --> 00:40:29.880
JAMES FREY: You will.

00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:32.510
There will be ways
to-- different lines

00:40:32.510 --> 00:40:34.470
will be able to align
with other lines.

00:40:34.470 --> 00:40:37.130
So there will-- and
then you will also

00:40:37.130 --> 00:40:39.440
be able to betray them.

00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:42.230
You'll have advantages
over certain lines.

00:40:42.230 --> 00:40:44.980
You'll have disadvantages
over certain lines.

00:40:44.980 --> 00:40:48.031
And you'll be able to align with
some people from other lines.

00:40:48.031 --> 00:40:49.864
AUDIENCE: So the people
I want to play with,

00:40:49.864 --> 00:40:51.340
I should pick the
same line as them.

00:40:51.340 --> 00:40:52.965
JAMES FREY: Or you
should just-- you'll

00:40:52.965 --> 00:40:56.590
be able to see what lines
you can align yourself with.

00:40:56.590 --> 00:40:59.780
Just choose complementary lines.

00:40:59.780 --> 00:41:03.620
Or if they're, like, more
a frenemy than a friend,

00:41:03.620 --> 00:41:06.370
choose a line where you
have advantages over,

00:41:06.370 --> 00:41:09.968
and you get to go wipe them out.

00:41:09.968 --> 00:41:12.458
AUDIENCE: For the
game, could you--

00:41:12.458 --> 00:41:16.270
are you going to be
traveling not on your device?

00:41:16.270 --> 00:41:19.720
Do you have to travel places
to unlock special things?

00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:21.607
Or do you do that in the game?

00:41:21.607 --> 00:41:23.690
JAMES FREY: Well, in this
game, one big difference

00:41:23.690 --> 00:41:25.790
between "Ingress"
is you can unlock

00:41:25.790 --> 00:41:27.770
certain things by buying them.

00:41:27.770 --> 00:41:32.010
But make sure your dad
says it's OK first.

00:41:32.010 --> 00:41:33.680
But yes, you'll be
traveling on foot.

00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:35.160
You'll be just like "Ingress."

00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:38.150
That's one of the greatest--
if anything-- you know,

00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:40.410
that's one of the greatest
things about "Ingress."

00:41:40.410 --> 00:41:43.760
The great, radical step
that "Ingress" took

00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:45.800
is that it gets you
out into the world.

00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:48.580
You're not sitting in a
chair playing a video game.

00:41:48.580 --> 00:41:49.660
You have to play it.

00:41:49.660 --> 00:41:52.270
You have to go out in the world.

00:41:52.270 --> 00:41:54.930
And we definitely-- that was
one of the things I thought

00:41:54.930 --> 00:41:57.360
was awesome about it and
one of the reasons I called.

00:42:00.450 --> 00:42:03.330
So thank you very,
very much for coming.

00:42:03.330 --> 00:42:05.840
I'm stoked, as
always, to be here.

00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:09.140
And I hope you get
a copy of the book.

00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:10.134
And I hope you read it.

00:42:10.134 --> 00:42:11.050
And I hope you dig it.

00:42:11.050 --> 00:42:14.000
And when the game comes out, I
hope you play it and love it.

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:16.835
And check out
ancientsocieties.com

00:42:16.835 --> 00:42:18.700
where all the ARG fiction is.

00:42:18.700 --> 00:42:22.380
There's a ton of awesome
material on there already.

00:42:22.380 --> 00:42:24.070
And there's only more coming.

00:42:24.070 --> 00:42:28.320
And yeah, go Google.

00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:29.870
[APPLAUSE]
