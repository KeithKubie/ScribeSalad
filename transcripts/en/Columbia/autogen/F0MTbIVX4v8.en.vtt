originally then built by the people who
hold seaport and the cannon may have

00:59:10.120 --> 00:59:10.130
hold seaport and the cannon may have
 

00:59:10.130 --> 00:59:13.360
hold seaport and the cannon may have
been placed by them but the main thing

00:59:13.360 --> 00:59:13.370
been placed by them but the main thing
 

00:59:13.370 --> 00:59:16.360
been placed by them but the main thing
is that you have heavy cannon that are

00:59:16.360 --> 00:59:16.370
is that you have heavy cannon that are
 

00:59:16.370 --> 00:59:20.080
is that you have heavy cannon that are
guarding the port or in strong points

00:59:20.080 --> 00:59:20.090
guarding the port or in strong points
 

00:59:20.090 --> 00:59:21.870
guarding the port or in strong points
that if they are captured by the enemy

00:59:21.870 --> 00:59:21.880
that if they are captured by the enemy
 

00:59:21.880 --> 00:59:26.290
that if they are captured by the enemy

00:59:26.290 --> 00:59:26.300
can be used to to close the shipping in
 

00:59:26.300 --> 00:59:29.710
can be used to to close the shipping in
the port so cannon become a very

00:59:29.710 --> 00:59:29.720
the port so cannon become a very
 

00:59:29.720 --> 00:59:37.780
the port so cannon become a very
important development but cannon that

00:59:37.780 --> 00:59:37.790
important development but cannon that
 

00:59:37.790 --> 00:59:43.050
important development but cannon that
are put in a in a fortress on shore are

00:59:43.050 --> 00:59:43.060
are put in a in a fortress on shore are
 

00:59:43.060 --> 00:59:51.820
are put in a in a fortress on shore are
very heavy they're big they shoot shoot

00:59:51.820 --> 00:59:51.830
very heavy they're big they shoot shoot
 

00:59:51.830 --> 00:59:55.630
very heavy they're big they shoot shoot
cannonballs fairly long distances and

00:59:55.630 --> 00:59:55.640
cannonballs fairly long distances and
 

00:59:55.640 --> 00:59:58.440
cannonballs fairly long distances and
you can't easily put them in a galley

00:59:58.440 --> 00:59:58.450
you can't easily put them in a galley
 

00:59:58.450 --> 01:00:01.360
you can't easily put them in a galley
because the the heavier the weapon you

01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:01.370
because the the heavier the weapon you
 

01:00:01.370 --> 01:00:03.010
because the the heavier the weapon you
put in the galley the harder you have to

01:00:03.010 --> 01:00:03.020
put in the galley the harder you have to
 

01:00:03.020 --> 01:00:10.900
put in the galley the harder you have to
row and in order to fight at sea in a

quantified that he said how fast is that
 

01:01:19.850 --> 01:01:24.560
quantified that he said how fast is that
because he said you know you have to go

01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:24.570
because he said you know you have to go
 

01:01:24.570 --> 01:01:27.740

it so that you can board and therefore
 

01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:41.170
it so that you can board and therefore
you have to you may row at so many

01:01:41.170 --> 01:01:41.180
you have to you may row at so many
 

01:01:41.180 --> 01:01:46.340
you have to you may row at so many

conditions but then under ramming
 

01:01:48.270 --> 01:01:51.170
conditions but then under ramming
conditions you row much much harder and

01:01:51.170 --> 01:01:51.180
conditions you row much much harder and
 

01:01:51.180 --> 01:01:55.130

power 25 something like that and you
close the distance as rapidly as you can

01:02:00.140 --> 01:02:00.150
close the distance as rapidly as you can
 

01:02:00.150 --> 01:02:01.940
close the distance as rapidly as you can
with as much force as you can of course

01:02:01.940 --> 01:02:01.950
with as much force as you can of course

you have to have a more fresh water

01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:02.850
you have to have a more fresh water
 

01:02:02.850 --> 01:02:04.460
you have to have a more fresh water
because everyone's getting exhausted

01:02:04.460 --> 01:02:04.470

01:02:04.470 --> 01:02:07.790
because everyone's getting exhausted
rowing at that speed so then he said

01:02:07.790 --> 01:02:07.800
rowing at that speed so then he said
 

01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:11.780
rowing at that speed so then he said
well would it be better to simply put a

01:02:11.780 --> 01:02:11.790
well would it be better to simply put a
 

01:02:11.790 --> 01:02:14.570
well would it be better to simply put a
cannon on the boat and shoot at the

01:02:14.570 --> 01:02:14.580
cannon on the boat and shoot at the
 

01:02:14.580 --> 01:02:18.980
cannon on the boat and shoot at the
enemy from a distance and then row up

01:02:18.980 --> 01:02:18.990
enemy from a distance and then row up
 

01:02:18.990 --> 01:02:24.100
enemy from a distance and then row up
and hit the enemy because you've you've

01:02:24.100 --> 01:02:24.110
and hit the enemy because you've you've
 

01:02:24.110 --> 01:02:26.810
and hit the enemy because you've you've
kept his head down you scared him maybe

01:02:26.810 --> 01:02:26.820
kept his head down you scared him maybe
 

01:02:26.820 --> 01:02:28.820
kept his head down you scared him maybe
you've even hit the other one with your

01:02:28.820 --> 01:02:28.830
you've even hit the other one with your
 

01:02:28.830 --> 01:02:32.390
you've even hit the other one with your
cannon so then he he look to the

01:02:32.390 --> 01:02:32.400
cannon so then he he look to the
 

01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:35.240
cannon so then he he look to the
question of if you fired it if you put a

01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:35.250
question of if you fired it if you put a
 

01:02:35.250 --> 01:02:38.570
question of if you fired it if you put a
cannon on a galley and you fired it how

01:02:38.570 --> 01:02:38.580
cannon on a galley and you fired it how
 

01:02:38.580 --> 01:02:41.530
cannon on a galley and you fired it how
long did it take you to reload it

01:02:41.530 --> 01:02:41.540
long did it take you to reload it
 

01:02:41.540 --> 01:02:44.950
long did it take you to reload it
because loading a cannon from the front

01:02:44.950 --> 01:02:44.960
because loading a cannon from the front
 

01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:47.660
because loading a cannon from the front
was a cumbersome point of do you had to

01:02:47.660 --> 01:02:47.670
was a cumbersome point of do you had to
 

01:02:47.670 --> 01:02:49.550
was a cumbersome point of do you had to
swap out the residue you had to put in

01:02:49.550 --> 01:02:49.560
swap out the residue you had to put in
 

01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:50.990
swap out the residue you had to put in
the powder you had to put in the ball

01:02:50.990 --> 01:02:51.000
the powder you had to put in the ball
 

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:52.940
the powder you had to put in the ball
you had to put in something to keep the

01:02:52.940 --> 01:02:52.950
you had to put in something to keep the
 

01:02:52.950 --> 01:02:55.980
you had to put in something to keep the
ball from from bouncing out

01:02:55.980 --> 01:02:55.990
ball from from bouncing out
 

01:02:55.990 --> 01:02:58.740
ball from from bouncing out
ah and he said you know if you are

01:02:58.740 --> 01:02:58.750
ah and he said you know if you are
 

01:02:58.750 --> 01:03:00.420
ah and he said you know if you are
rowing at top speed

01:03:00.420 --> 01:03:00.430
rowing at top speed
 

01:03:00.430 --> 01:03:05.100
rowing at top speed
if you fire from a distance and then you

01:03:05.100 --> 01:03:05.110
if you fire from a distance and then you
 

01:03:05.110 --> 01:03:08.490
if you fire from a distance and then you
row you're going to hit the other boat

01:03:08.490 --> 01:03:08.500
row you're going to hit the other boat
 

01:03:08.500 --> 01:03:11.880
row you're going to hit the other boat
before you can reload because you can't

01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:11.890
before you can reload because you can't
 

01:03:11.890 --> 01:03:15.510
before you can reload because you can't
go that far at that speed so he said the

01:03:15.510 --> 01:03:15.520
go that far at that speed so he said the
 

01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:19.109
go that far at that speed so he said the
logic was that you put cannon on the

01:03:19.109 --> 01:03:19.119
logic was that you put cannon on the
 

01:03:19.119 --> 01:03:24.480
logic was that you put cannon on the
boat to fire them the moment you hit so

01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:24.490
boat to fire them the moment you hit so
 

01:03:24.490 --> 01:03:27.150
boat to fire them the moment you hit so
you at the front of the galley you you

01:03:27.150 --> 01:03:27.160
you at the front of the galley you you
 

01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:30.750
you at the front of the galley you you
put up kind of a TV antenna that has

01:03:30.750 --> 01:03:30.760
put up kind of a TV antenna that has
 

01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:34.170
put up kind of a TV antenna that has
cannons on it now shooting out in them

01:03:34.170 --> 01:03:34.180
cannons on it now shooting out in them
 

01:03:34.180 --> 01:03:36.390
cannons on it now shooting out in them
different shooting forward because of an

01:03:36.390 --> 01:03:36.400
different shooting forward because of an
 

01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:38.510
different shooting forward because of an
array of cannons but they're all small

01:03:38.510 --> 01:03:38.520
array of cannons but they're all small
 

01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:42.420
array of cannons but they're all small
like an inch or two in diameter for the

01:03:42.420 --> 01:03:42.430
like an inch or two in diameter for the
 

01:03:42.430 --> 01:03:45.930
like an inch or two in diameter for the
bore and then as you you know you you

01:03:45.930 --> 01:03:45.940
bore and then as you you know you you
 

01:03:45.940 --> 01:03:49.440
bore and then as you you know you you
charge you roll like mad and then just

01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:49.450
charge you roll like mad and then just
 

01:03:49.450 --> 01:03:51.240
charge you roll like mad and then just
as you're hitting the other boat you

01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:51.250
as you're hitting the other boat you
 

01:03:51.250 --> 01:03:53.940
as you're hitting the other boat you
touch off all of the cannon on your on

01:03:53.940 --> 01:03:53.950
touch off all of the cannon on your on
 

01:03:53.950 --> 01:03:58.620
touch off all of the cannon on your on
your front array to to blow away the

01:03:58.620 --> 01:03:58.630
your front array to to blow away the
 

01:03:58.630 --> 01:04:01.230
your front array to to blow away the
enemy right at the point of contact then

01:04:01.230 --> 01:04:01.240
enemy right at the point of contact then
 

01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:02.730
enemy right at the point of contact then
you go and you leap across and you

01:04:02.730 --> 01:04:02.740
you go and you leap across and you
 

01:04:02.740 --> 01:04:07.730
you go and you leap across and you
occupy the other the other side so he

01:04:07.730 --> 01:04:07.740
occupy the other the other side so he
 

01:04:07.740 --> 01:04:11.849
occupy the other the other side so he
quantified this and experimented very

01:04:11.849 --> 01:04:11.859
quantified this and experimented very
 

01:04:11.859 --> 01:04:14.730
quantified this and experimented very
convincingly and he said that the the

01:04:14.730 --> 01:04:14.740
convincingly and he said that the the
 

01:04:14.740 --> 01:04:18.000
convincingly and he said that the the
upshot is that if you were fighting in

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:18.010
upshot is that if you were fighting in
 

01:04:18.010 --> 01:04:20.099
upshot is that if you were fighting in
the Mediterranean it made no difference

01:04:20.099 --> 01:04:20.109
