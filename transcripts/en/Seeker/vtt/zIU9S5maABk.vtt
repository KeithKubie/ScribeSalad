00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.600
My first book I ever read was Hop on Pop by
Dr. Suess, but what was going on in my brain

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:08.330
when I was learning to read?

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:11.309
Hey guys.

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:12.530
Julia here for DNews

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.340
According to a study by the Department of
Education and the National Institute of Literacy

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.760
32 million American adults can’t read.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.539
More than most developed nations, so what’s
going on?

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.330
Is our education system failing us?

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:24.330
Or is it our language?

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.330
Here in the states most students begin to
learn to read in kindergarten, learning the

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.970
alphabet, turning those letters into sounds
and then working their way up to whole words.

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.079
But learning to read is a very long complicated
processes.

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:38.230
One of the keys to being able to read is Automatic
word processing.

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.700
It’s basically how the brain decides a group
of symbols is actually a word within milliseconds.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.379
One study published in the journal Developmental
Science found that this process happens around

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.520
fourth and fifth grade.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.370
But for some the process is much longer.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.640
Researchers had participants look at a list
of words, fake words that looked like real

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.610
words, and strings of random symbols.

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.760
They found that for most people, no matter
their age knew the difference between real

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:59.760
words and not.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.660
But after placing an electrode cap on participants
heads, the researchers learned how people

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.229
subconsciously react to words and symbols.

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:10.170
They found that college kids could instantly
tell the difference but surprisingly elementary

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.039
school students still respond to random symbols
as words even as late as 5th grade.

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:18.039
So this experiment was designed to test Automatic
word processing.

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:21.909
So your brain reads these symbols as words,
which it reads not based on its individual

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:24.340
parts or letters, but based on how it looks
as a whole.

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.569
You’ve seen that meme going around, that
if letters are mixed up in a word you can

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:28.569
still read it.

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:32.139
While most of that post is just internet baloney,
it does have some truth to it.

00:01:32.139 --> 00:01:36.590
Your brain can read words as a single object
rather than a string of letters put together.

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.420
A study published in the Journal of Neuroscience
found that there’s a small area of the brain,

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.779
on the left side of the visual cortex, that
can “read” words.

00:01:43.779 --> 00:01:47.389
Basically this part of the brain sits right
next to the part that recognizes faces.

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:51.700
So one area of the visual cortex can quickly
identify a face, another can quickly read

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:52.700
a word.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.130
But when is the best time to learn to read?

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.659
Well there’s a crucial window between kindergarten
and third grade.

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.709
Research published in the journal Psychological
Science found that the amount of white matter

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:04.670
growth in the temporoparietal region during
that window strongly predicted how well that

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:05.670
kid would learn to read.

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.959
It didn’t matter so much as to what their
home life was like or their genetic predisposition.

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.420
This area of the brain is super important
for things like phonological processing, speech,

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:14.420
and reading.

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.739
One of the lead researchers, Fumiko Hoeft,
thinks that if the growth in this part of

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:20.830
the brain doesn’t happen at the right time,
the kid could have problems with reading.

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.489
But the problem with our literacy rate might
have more to do with our language than with

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:26.569
our educational system or our brains.

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:29.159
English is one of the most irregular languages.

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:31.079
Words more often break rules than conform.

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:35.340
So learning to read and write becomes a matter
of memorizing words which can take years and

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.340
years.

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.420
Other languages it can only take a year, because
they have a written language that follows

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:40.420
rules.

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.209
So if a person comes across a new word they
haven’t heard before, they can pretty much

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:44.680
figure out how to spell it.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.500
In English read and read mean two different
things but are spelled the exact same way.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:49.500
WHY.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.500
COME ON ENGLISH WHY.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.609
Apparently I am not the only one who questions
this, from Benjamin Franklin’s phonetic

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:58.140
alphabet to an entirely new system called
Unspell which looks like squiggly lines, there’s

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.730
been plenty of attempts to reform the written
language over the years.

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.530
Will it happen anytime soon?

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:04.530
Probably not.

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.920
Speaking of reading, while it may be one of
the best pastimes around, it’s sometimes

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.540
considered one of the most dangerous.

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.569
In Nazi Germany thousands of books were burned
in an attempt to control the minds of their

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:14.569
people.

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:17.849

the lost books, check out this great episode

from our seeker show Seeker.

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:32.129
So what do you think?

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:33.180
Is English due for an overhaul?

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.730
What was it like for you when you first learned
to read?

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:44.670
