00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.770
We're told that the sum
of three consecutive

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:07.080
odd integers is 231.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.470
What is the largest integer?

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:11.340
So let's think about
this a little bit.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.920
Let's say that x is the
smallest integer.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:20.040
x is equal to the smallest
odd of these three.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.110
It's not the smallest odd
integer of all integers, it's

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:24.270
is the smallest odd of
these three, the

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:25.600
smallest odd integer.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.290
So what's the next
one going to be?

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:29.380
Well, if I have one odd integer,
what's going to be

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:30.650
the next odd integer?

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:31.500
Let's think about this.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.050
If x was 3, what's the
next odd integer?

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:34.920
It's 5.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.160
And then what's the next
one after that?

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.820
It's 7.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.200
And the next one after that?

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.350
It's 9.

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.320
So every time we add 2.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.460
So if the smallest one is x, the
next smallest odd integer

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:54.940
is x plus 2, is equal to the
next smallest odd integer--

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.150
I'll write integer here--
odd integer.

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:59.580
And then what would
be the next one?

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.820
Well, we're going to add
2 to this one, right?

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.379
So it's going to be x plus 4.

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:04.860
Think about it.

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.260
If the smallest is 3, then you
have x plus 2, which is 5.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.240
And then you have x plus
4, which is 7.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:18.260
So this will be the largest of
the consecutive odd integer in

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:19.200
this group.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.940
And they tell us that the sum
of these consecutive odd

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.910
integers is 231.

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:25.600
What is the largest integer?

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.190
So if I take x, x plus 2 and x
plus 4, and I sum them, they

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:30.820
should be equal to 231.

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.550
So let's do that.

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:39.930
So we have x plus x plus 2, plus
x plus 4, and this needs

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.880
to be equal to 231.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.865
And when they ask us what's the
largest one, we're going

00:01:43.865 --> 00:01:46.930
to have to tell them what
x plus 4 is equal to.

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.790
So let's just solve
this equation.

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.480
So let's add our x terms. We
have one x, two x, three x's,

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:56.630
so we get 3x plus-- and then
what are our constants?

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.890
We have a 2 and we have a 4.

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:06.750
So 3x plus 6 is equal to 231.

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.250
Now, let's get rid
of the 6 from the

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.440
left-hand side of the equation.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.350
The best way to do that it is to
subtract 6 from both sides.

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.910
So let's subtract 6
from both sides.

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.990
The left-hand side, we're
just left with the 3x.

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:21.470
The 6's cancel out.

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:30.500
The right-hand side,
231 minus 6 is 225.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.895
We have 3x is equal to 225.

00:02:32.895 --> 00:02:36.030
To isolate the x, let's just
divide both sides by 3.

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.720
The left-hand side, the 3's
cancel out-- that was the

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:48.880
whole point behind dividing by
3-- we get just an x is being

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.490
equal to-- and 225
divided by 3.

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:52.320
Let me do it over here.

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.630
So 3 goes into 225.

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.750
It goes into 22 7 times.

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.180
7 times 3 is 21.

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.950
22 minus 21 is 1.

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.810
Bring down the 5.

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.540
3 goes into 15 5 times.

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.700
5 times 3 is 15.

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.860
Subtract, no remainder.

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:20.150
So 225 divided by 3 is 75.

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:25.840
So the smallest, the smallest
of the odd integers is 75.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.520
So this one is 75.

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.430
What's x plus 2 going
to be equal to?

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.670
Well, that's going
to be 2 more, 77.

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.770
And what's x plus 4 going
to be equal to?

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:37.550
Well, that's the largest
of them.

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:43.130
x is 75 plus 4 is
going to be 79.

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.470
And notice, we have three
odd integers.

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:46.450
They're consecutive.

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.110
They're the, you know, they're
the odd integers that come

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:50.710
directly after each other.

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:54.680
And let's verify that when we
add them up, we get 231.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:00.050
So if we get 75 plus-- let me
just write it like this-- 75

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:04.850
plus 77, plus 79, want
to add them all up.

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:06.920
5 plus 7 is 12.

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.320
12 plus 9 is 21.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:11.780
Carry the 2.

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.680
2 plus 7 is 9.

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.209
9 plus 7 is 16.

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:20.019
16 plus 7 is 23.

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:20.990
So there you have it.

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:23.210
The three consecutive odd
integers, when you add them

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.830
up, you got 231.

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.470
They're consecutive and odd.

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:28.910
They ask, what's the largest?

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.040
The largest is 79.
