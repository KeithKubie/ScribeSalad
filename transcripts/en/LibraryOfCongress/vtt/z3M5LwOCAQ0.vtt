00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:05.000
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:15.930
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter: Good morning!

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:17.230
&gt;&gt; [Group] Good morning!

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:19.690
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter:
I'm Lee Ann Potter.

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:22.880
I direct educational outreach
here at the Library of Congress

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.880
and I am so happy that
all of you are here

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.870
for this really terrific event.

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:32.350
How many of you -- and I'm going
to ask you guys to turn that --

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:35.930
dim that light for just a second
so I can see a raise of hands --

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.130
how many of you have
ever tried something new?

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.060
Yeah, I kind of thought so.

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.990
So, you know how when
you try something new,

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:47.490
you're really excited about it

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:49.970
and then sometimes you get a
little bit scared about it?

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.090
You know how that is?

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:57.300
Yeah, well that happens to
all of us and here at --

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.770
well, let me put it this way.

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.630
When you're excited and
even when you're scared,

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:06.270
it always helps to have
somebody who is encouraging you

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.360
and somebody who is as
enthusiastic and as excited

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.570
as you are about whatever
that new thing is, you know?

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.350
And here at the library,

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.430
we've been trying a lot
of new things lately.

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.190
We want to make sure
that everybody knows

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.080
about this amazing library
and its incredible collections

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.310
and how much we can learn
here at the library.

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.810
And when I say we're trying
a whole bunch of new things,

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.020
you know, new things
like maybe, you know,

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.310
inviting a superstar
wrestler/actor

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.750
to come and read a book.

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.850
And fortunately for us, we
have a Librarian of Congress

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:49.920
who shares our excitement
and encourages and leads us

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.240
with her energy and
her enthusiasm.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.170
So I am really honored this
morning to be the one who gets

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.560
to introduce you to
Dr. Carla Hayden,

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.690
the 14th Librarian of Congress.

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.560
She earned her PhD at the
University of Chicago.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.990
She began her career as
a children's librarian.

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.530
She led the Pratt
Library in Baltimore.

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.970
She was the president of the
American Library Association.

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:21.690
And she is absolutely aware
of the power of reading

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.510
and the magic of a good
story -- Dr. Hayden.

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.080
[ Applause ]

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.180
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: So
what an exciting day.

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.670
You didn't know all that other
stuff that she was saying

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.530
when I was here seeing
how you all are.

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.270
I am so excited because this
is such a special program.

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:47.890
So I'd like you -- and I got
a chance to meet a lot of you

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.540
and I'm supposed to say here, it
says "Please hold your applause

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.800
until I introduce
all of the schools."

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.830
But let's see how that works.

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:03.170
I do have to ask you, we have
young people that are not here

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:04.940
with us in Washington, DC.

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.780
So when we get to them, could
you give them a big hand?

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.170
Because from Washington, DC,

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.460
right here in the Coolidge
Auditorium, we have students

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:18.510
from Capitol Hill
Montessori School.

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.760
[ Applause ]

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.510
Bishop John T. Walker

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.400
[ Applause ]

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.700
Plummer Elementary
School [applause].

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.970
Uh-oh, the excitement is rising.

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:38.420
Kimball Elementary
School [applause].

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:46.960
Langdon Elementary

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:50.320
Murray Elementary
School [applause].

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.540
MYSA Micro School [applause].

00:03:52.540 --> 00:04:00.020
And, now you right here in
DC, we have to also welcome

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:03.960
and we have students from the
Langley School in McLean -- yay!

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:09.230
And we have students,
like I told you,

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:13.100
from across the country who are
watching us live on Facebook

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:15.400
and YouTube [applause].

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.800
So let's give a big Washington,
DC, McLean, Virginia,

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.510
welcome to the Calverton School
in Huntingtown, Maryland.

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.640
[ Applause ]

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:35.510
The Tinmouth Elementary
School in Tinmouth, Vermont.

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:39.160
[ Applause ]

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.440
And the John Dawes
School in Englishtown,

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.620
New Jersey [applause].

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.600
So welcome, all of you.

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.770
As you can imagine, it's an
exciting day here at the Library

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:56.110
of Congress and we have some
more events in the next few days

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.420
that you might want
to think about.

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:03.740
On Friday at 10:30, I'm doing a
special story time with the one

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.160
and only Paddington Bear.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.510
He will be here in
person -- or in bear --

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:13.380
taking pictures with
children that will be there.

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.470
And on Wednesday, next
Wednesday at 11AM,

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:20.730
we're going to have a holiday
story time in the Great Hall

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:22.240
and we will have one menorah

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.090
and we're just going
to have a good time.

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.720
So we hope that you
will join us.

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:30.160
Now, today, wow!

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:36.120
In September of 1936, the Viking
Press published "The Story

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.400
of Ferdinand," written
by Munro Leaf

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.790
and illustrated by
Robert Lawson.

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:47.590
And this book became so
popular that, by 1938,

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:51.270
it was already in
its 11th printing.

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:55.620
And today, as I mentioned a
little earlier, we have the son

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:57.930
of Mr. Leaf, Andy Leaf.

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:59.730
So let's give him
a welcome again.

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:09.470
[ Applause ]

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:13.520
And, as I think you
know, later this month,

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:18.030
20th Century Fox will be
releasing a feature-length

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:21.190
animated film based on the book.

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:24.130
And the person who
is joining us today,

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:30.510
actor and wrestling superstar,
Mr. John Cena will be.

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:40.530
[ Applause ]

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:43.590
Will be the voice of Ferdinand.

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:48.740
And today, yes today,
as soon as I leave

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:52.400
and I'm sure you're ready,
he will read the book

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:54.270
and he's going to
talk to us a bit

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:57.980
and you'll have a chance
to ask him questions.

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:02.930
So, as he reads, you'll see
the pages of the book --

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:07.320
not just the pages of any copy
of the book, but the pages

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:13.530
from the original 1936
edition, the actual one

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:16.430
that was submitted to
the Library of Congress

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:20.690
to have a copyright
and it's right here.

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:24.100
You probably know "The Story of
Ferdinand" has been translated

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:28.080
into more than 16
languages and is included

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:34.100
in Time Magazine's 100 Best
Children's Books of All Time.

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:37.900
So it reminds us
that the best version

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:41.410
of yourself means helping
others and that's something

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:42.890
that our special guest today,

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:45.970
Mr. John Cena, does
all the time.

00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:47.980
He's actually set the record

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:52.550
for Make-A-Wish granting
with over 500 wishes.

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:59.130
So please join me in welcoming
16-time world champion wrestler,

00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:02.410
five-time US champion wrestler,

00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:04.900
record-setting Make-A-Wish
grantor,

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:07.970
star of blockbuster
movies, the man you're here

00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:11.510
to see, Mr. John Cena.

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:17.040
[ Applause ]

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:18.340
Whoa!

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:20.140
&gt;&gt; John Cena: Look
at this place!

00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:28.050
[ Applause ]

00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:39.320
Thank you very much [applause].

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:40.620
What a special day!

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:44.090
I'm going to put my 1938
edition Ferdinand next

00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:46.200
to the first print 1936 edition.

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:50.210
We're going to look at the
1936 edition but not touch it.

00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:52.990
It's very, very delicate
and very important.

00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:56.380
And the people from the Library
of Congress were very thorough

00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:59.430
in saying like, hey, don't
touch the first book.

00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:02.500
[laughter] So I'm going
to oblige their wishes

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:04.110
and we're going to
do this thing.

00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:06.740
I'm very, very excited
to be here today.

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:09.200
I'd like to first thank the
Leaf family for allowing me

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:11.660
to be a part of something
like this, because certainly

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:12.960
without the creation
of the story

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:15.410
of Ferdinand I wouldn't be
here reading to you today.

00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:19.790
So it's a great honor and I'm
very grateful to be chosen

00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:21.800
as Ferdinand for the
movie that's coming out.

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:24.180
But it all starts with
the very famous story.

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:29.270
This story has a very important
and a very powerful message.

00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:31.110
And the book has
been in publication

00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:33.050
for over 80 years now.

00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:40.000
That means this book is
twice as old as I am.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.770
[laughter] But I think,
I think the reason

00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:46.200
that the message continually
gets sent and absorbed year

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:50.040
after year is because
it's very easy to digest.

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:51.920
Ferdinand is such a large bull

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:54.890
that people think he's
one thing, but the advent

00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:57.840
of him loving flowers
humanizes him.

00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:01.190
And you realize that what you
see isn't always what you get.

00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:04.790
It's a very important story and
certainly a story that's close

00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:08.680
to my heart, as the life
that you see that live

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:12.680
on WW Television mirrors kind
of the story of Ferdinand.

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:16.620
I go through a lot of pressure
every day to change who I am.

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:19.470
And there's a lot of folks
using some negative influence

00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:22.480
out there to try to make
me change my values.

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:25.650
But it just makes me stand
up and be proud of who I am

00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:27.310
and be proud of those values.

00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:29.950
And not change to try
to please someone else.

00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:31.510
Just be proud of who I am.

00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:34.720
So with that said, we've got
an excellent story today.

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:36.500
I'm going to read and they
said I was going to talk

00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:38.430
after I read, but I've
already switched it up.

00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:42.600
I've already talked because I
want you to have as much time

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.700
as you can for questions
afterwards.

00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:46.740
So I look forward
to hearing from you

00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:49.870
after we hear from this.

00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:52.170
Shall we? [clears throat].

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:56.360
"The Story of Ferdinand."

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:59.240
This is my loan agreement
from the Library

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:00.540
of Congress [laughter].

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:06.800
I promised to return this book,
the penalty is quite heavy.

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:11.760
Once upon a time in Spain,
there was a little bull,

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:14.270
and his name was Ferdinand.

00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:19.710
All the other little bulls
he lived with run, jump,

00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:23.050
and butt their heads together.

00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:24.640
But not Ferdinand.

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:32.410
He liked to just sit quietly
and [sniffs] smell the flowers.

00:11:32.410 --> 00:11:37.950
He had a favorite spot out in
the pasture, under a cork tree.

00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:47.760
It was his favorite tree, and he
would sit in its shade all day

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:51.050
and [sniffs] smell the flowers.

00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:57.260
Sometimes his mother, who was
a cow, would worry about him.

00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:01.290
She was afraid he would be
lonesome and all by himself.

00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:06.470
Why don't you run and play with
the other little bulls, skip,

00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:09.600
and butt your head,
she would say.

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:12.080
And Ferdinand would
shake his head.

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:15.300
I like it better here where
I can just sit quietly

00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:16.670
and smell the flowers.

00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:22.610
His mother saw that
he was not lonesome.

00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:25.260
And because she was an
understanding mother,

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:28.080
even though she was a cow,

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:34.420
she let him just sit
there and be happy.

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:40.630
As the years went by,
Ferdinand grew and grew,

00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:44.630
until he was very
big and very strong.

00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:47.800
All the other bulls who
had grown up with him

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:51.680
in the same pasture would
fight each other all day.

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:52.980
They would butt each other

00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:55.700
and stick each other
with their horns.

00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:59.100
What they wanted most of all
was to be picked to fight

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:03.150
in the bullfights in Madrid.

00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:05.490
But not Ferdinand.

00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:08.480
He still liked to
just sit quietly

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:12.750
under the cork tree,
smell the flowers.

00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:18.240
One day, five men came in very
funny hats to pick the biggest,

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:22.930
fastest, roughest bull to fight
in the bullfights in Madrid.

00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:29.930
All the other bulls ran around
snorting and butting, leaping

00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:33.180
and jumping so the men would
think that they were very,

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:37.740
very strong and fierce,
and pick them.

00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:40.660
Ferdinand knew that
they wouldn't pick him

00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:43.210
and he didn't care.

00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:48.460
So he went out to his
favorite cork tree to sit down.

00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:52.020
He didn't look where he was
sitting, and instead of sitting

00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:59.080
in the nice cool grass in the
shade, he sat on a bumblebee.

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:03.040
Well, if you were a
bumblebee and a bull sat

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:06.290
on you, what would you do?

00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:07.720
You would sting him.

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:10.940
And that's exactly what
this bee did to Ferdinand.

00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:15.600
Wow, did it hurt!

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:18.040
Ferdinand jumped
up with a snort.

00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:21.470
He ran around puffing and
snorting, butting and pawing

00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:25.350
on the ground as
if he were crazy.

00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:29.600
The five men saw him and
they all shouted with joy.

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:34.020
Here was the largest and
fiercest bull of all!

00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:37.030
Just the one bull for
the fights in Madrid!

00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:43.280
So they took him away for
the bullfight day in a cart.

00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:49.810
And what a day it was.

00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:51.180
Flags were flying.

00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:53.310
Bands were playing.

00:14:53.310 --> 00:14:55.930
All the lovely ladies had
flowers in their hair.

00:14:55.930 --> 00:15:00.970
They had a parade
into the bullring.

00:15:00.970 --> 00:15:08.630
First came the bandoleros with
long sharp pins with ribbons

00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:12.070
on them to stick the
bull and make him mad.

00:15:12.070 --> 00:15:17.220
Next came the picadores,
who rode skinny horses

00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:20.070
and they had long
spears to stick the bull

00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:23.590
and make him even madder.

00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:28.430
Then came the matador,
the proudest of all.

00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:32.990
He thought he was very handsome
and bowed to the ladies.

00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:36.200
He had a red cape and a
sword and was supposed

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:40.210
to stick the bull last of all.

00:15:41.970 --> 00:15:44.700
Then came the bull.

00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:48.630
And you know who
that was, don't you?

00:15:48.630 --> 00:15:50.650
Ferdinand!

00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:53.140
They called him Ferdinand
the fierce.

00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:55.650
And all the bandoleros
were afraid of him.

00:15:55.650 --> 00:15:57.750
And the picadors
were afraid of him.

00:15:57.750 --> 00:16:01.340
And the matador was
scared stiff.

00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:03.090
Ferdinand ran into the
middle of the ring.

00:16:03.090 --> 00:16:05.310
And everyone shouted
and clapped,

00:16:05.310 --> 00:16:07.630
because they thought he was
going to fight fiercely and butt

00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:11.470
and snort and stick
his horns around.

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:15.160
But not Ferdinand.

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:18.200
When he got to the middle of
the ring, he saw the flowers

00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:21.280
in all the lovely ladies'
hair and he just sat

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:24.310
down and quietly smelled.

00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:30.540
He wouldn't fight and be
fierce no matter what they did.

00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:34.360
He just sat [sniffs]
and smelled.

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:37.430
The bandoleros were mad and
the picadors were madder

00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:40.180
and the matador was
so mad that he cried,

00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:47.200
because he couldn't show
off with his cape and sword.

00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:50.810
So they had to take
Ferdinand home.

00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:56.840
And for all I know, he
is sitting there still

00:16:56.840 --> 00:17:00.280
under his favorite cork tree,

00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:03.420
[sniffs] smelling the
flowers just quietly.

00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:06.470
And he is very happy.

00:17:08.410 --> 00:17:11.510
The end.

00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:29.050
[ Applause ]

00:17:29.050 --> 00:17:33.240
What a cool story and
what an important message.

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:35.200
Being different's okay.

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:36.690
We're not all alike.

00:17:36.690 --> 00:17:38.730
And we should be proud
that even if you look

00:17:38.730 --> 00:17:41.870
around this audience,
we're all different.

00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:44.030
And we should be
okay being different.

00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:46.000
Because even if you're
different like Ferdinand and you

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.310
like to [sniffs]
smell the flowers,

00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:52.640
as long as you're
happy, that's cool.

00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:55.300
Thank you guys for listening
to a wonderful story.

00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:56.600
And if you guys have
any questions

00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:58.520
for me, now is the time.

00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:00.820
So fire away.

00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:05.830
Ooh, lots of questions,
this is excellent.

00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:07.730
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter: Okay,
guys, the way we're going

00:18:07.730 --> 00:18:11.310
to do the questions is
I have four colleagues

00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:12.610
that are stationed.

00:18:12.610 --> 00:18:13.960
Right over here is Abby.

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:15.350
Over here is Catherine.

00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:16.650
Over here is Sasha.

00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:17.950
And I've got a mic.

00:18:17.950 --> 00:18:19.510
So we're going to
sort of work the room.

00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:22.390
I'll start with the
first question down here,

00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:24.450
and I'm going to throw
it over there to Abby

00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:27.380
and then we're just going to
make a big ole circle, okay.

00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:29.090
So how about you right here?

00:18:29.090 --> 00:18:31.300
And I'm not going to hand you
the mic, I'm going to hold it.

00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:33.120
I need you to speak
really clearly.

00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:37.320
And the deal here is we're
asking questions, okay.

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:39.420
So you can't just
say, oh, I love you.

00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:40.720
You can't do that, okay?

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:43.330
It's got to be questions,
all right?

00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:44.630
Okay.

00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:45.930
&gt;&gt; John Cena: All
righty, here we go.

00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:48.360
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter: Stand up
and you can say your name.

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:49.660
&gt;&gt; My name is Adrian.

00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:53.740
And can you tell me how
you and Ferdinand connect?

00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:55.830
&gt;&gt; John Cena: Oh, yeah,
that's a good question.

00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:58.370
So how do Ferdinand
and I connect?

00:18:58.370 --> 00:19:01.020
Well, Ferdinand is
misunderstood.

00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:03.180
People think because
he looks some way

00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:04.860
that he should be something.

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:08.880
And a lot of times in WWE
I'm very misunderstood.

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:11.190
There's a lot of people out
there chanting at the top

00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:13.010
of their lungs for
me to do something

00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:14.690
that I really don't want to do.

00:19:14.690 --> 00:19:18.480
But just like Ferdinand,
I make sure I stand proud

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:24.270
to what I believe
in and I'm happy.

00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:28.510
&gt;&gt; When you were born, did you
want to do what Ferdinand did,

00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:30.140
or you wanted to be a wrestler?

00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:32.320
&gt;&gt; John Cena: Say again.

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:34.610
&gt;&gt; When you were first born,
did you want to be a wrestler,

00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:36.710
or just do what Ferdinand did?

00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:38.010
&gt;&gt; John Cena: That's
a great question.

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:39.690
So when I was first
born, my eyes opened

00:19:39.690 --> 00:19:41.190
and I was like, what's going on?

00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:43.930
[laughter] Wow, this
place is weird

00:19:43.930 --> 00:19:46.130
and I can't even move my
hands or hold my head up.

00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:48.950
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:55.170
As a younger person,
I was very attracted

00:19:55.170 --> 00:19:59.220
and taken aback by WWE.

00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:01.960
Because I have an imagination,
just like all you guys.

00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:06.140
And man these WWE wrestlers
really spoke to my imagination.

00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:10.090
They were larger than life and
doing these amazing things.

00:20:10.090 --> 00:20:13.420
And I said to myself as a young
person one day I would really

00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:15.180
like to be a world champion.

00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:17.980
And here I am, a
16-time world champion.

00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:20.400
Now, that does mean that
I've lost it 16 times.

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:22.640
But I've done okay.

00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:28.110
&gt;&gt; What inspired you
to be in this book?

00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:32.330
&gt;&gt; John Cena: Oh, well,
the story is very special.

00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:37.200
And it's been in
publication for over 80 years.

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:40.050
And I think when you read it,
just like we all listened,

00:20:40.050 --> 00:20:43.070
even though sometimes
the words can get old,

00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:44.810
it never gets misunderstood.

00:20:44.810 --> 00:20:46.780
And I think the message
is really cool.

00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:48.570
And I was very happy to partner

00:20:48.570 --> 00:20:49.870
up with the folks
making the movie.

00:20:49.870 --> 00:20:52.070
The animators that made
the movie are very gifted.

00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:53.860
And once you guys see the movie,

00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:55.160
I think you're all
going to agree.

00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:56.460
It was a great thing
to be a part of.

00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:59.140
I think you guys are
all going to enjoy it.

00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:03.620
&gt;&gt; Before we go to my friend
over here, I have a question

00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:04.920
from one of the kids

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:06.860
in the school that's
watching over livestream.

00:21:06.860 --> 00:21:09.250
&gt;&gt; John Cena: Thank you
guys on the Internet.

00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:12.340
Hey.

00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:14.170
&gt;&gt; The name of the
student is Trevor.

00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:16.390
He's in fourth grade
at the Calverton School

00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:17.690
in Huntingtown, Maryland.

00:21:17.690 --> 00:21:21.230
And his question is: Dear John
Cena, why do you do what you do?

00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:22.590
Do you really enjoy it?

00:21:22.590 --> 00:21:25.250
Or do you ever wish
to do something else?

00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:26.550
&gt;&gt; John Cena: No.

00:21:26.550 --> 00:21:30.030
So this is a very important
message from Ferdinand.

00:21:30.030 --> 00:21:32.390
And if I could leave you with
one bit of information --

00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:33.780
I know we're going
to talk a lot today

00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:36.110
so sometimes your attention
span's going to go away.

00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:37.850
You may want to look at
your phone or something.

00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:39.150
Take this with you.

00:21:39.150 --> 00:21:42.100
I promise you, you've got
a long road ahead of each

00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:43.840
and every one of you out there.

00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:47.350
Make sure you do what you love.

00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:51.190
Because you asked if I would
want to do anything else, no.

00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:54.500
I want to be right
here right now with all

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:56.960
of you reading a
wonderful story,

00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:59.980
preparing to release a
wonderful movie to the world.

00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:02.380
And then hopefully if I get
what I want for Christmas,

00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:08.030
go back to my WWE family
and do what I love.

00:22:08.030 --> 00:22:10.690
So it's okay through life,
you're going to have pressures

00:22:10.690 --> 00:22:14.310
around you of people trying
to make you do certain things.

00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:16.920
If you do what you love
you'll never call it work.

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:19.210
Because right now we're
having fun and it ain't work.

00:22:19.210 --> 00:22:21.530
So I'm doing exactly
what I'd like to do.

00:22:21.530 --> 00:22:23.730
That's a great question.

00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:25.030
&gt;&gt; My name is Mekla.

00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:30.830
And I wonder, do you
like being in the ring?

00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:32.380
&gt;&gt; John Cena: Do I
like being in the ring?

00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:33.680
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:35.710
&gt;&gt; John Cena: When I'm
doing well [laughter].

00:22:35.710 --> 00:22:38.160
There aren't -- I mean,
it's all so exciting.

00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:41.320
The crowd noise is fantastic
and the lights are amazing

00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:42.930
and the fans are great.

00:22:42.930 --> 00:22:44.860
But there are those times

00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:47.630
when you let's say
finish second place,

00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:49.430
and those are tough times.

00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:56.310
But it keeps you wanting to get
better and come back for more.

00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:57.610
&gt;&gt; I'm Jay.

00:22:57.610 --> 00:22:59.430
And one question -- well,
actually two questions.

00:22:59.430 --> 00:23:01.810
&gt;&gt; John Cena: Two-parter,
excellent.

00:23:01.810 --> 00:23:04.420
&gt;&gt; What's your favorite
book as a kid?

00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:05.720
&gt;&gt; John Cena: What's that?

00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:09.830
&gt;&gt; What's your favorite
book as a kid?

00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:12.330
&gt;&gt; John Cena: My favorite
book as a kid was called "Cars

00:23:12.330 --> 00:23:16.130
and Trucks and Things That Go."

00:23:16.130 --> 00:23:17.430
[laughter].

00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:18.730
&gt;&gt; Wow!

00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:20.030
&gt;&gt; John Cena: I'll give you
a spoiler alert on to why

00:23:20.030 --> 00:23:21.330
that was my favorite book.

00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:28.320
Because I love cars and trucks
and things that go [laughter].

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:31.500
Okay, second part?

00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:35.830
&gt;&gt; And what's your favorite
thing to do on SmackDown Live?

00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:37.130
&gt;&gt; John Cena: What's that?

00:23:37.130 --> 00:23:39.810
&gt;&gt; What's your favorite thing
to do on SmackDown Live?

00:23:39.810 --> 00:23:42.060
&gt;&gt; John Cena: Ooh, I think
the easiest way to put

00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:44.920
that is be a part
of SmackDown Live.

00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:46.760
Because folks like you
are entertained by it.

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:48.060
So thank you.

00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:49.360
Two good questions.

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:51.650
&gt;&gt; Is it hard being a wrestler

00:23:51.650 --> 00:23:56.120
and being an actor
at the same time?

00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:57.420
&gt;&gt; John Cena: Ooh, no.

00:23:57.420 --> 00:23:59.880
Because you just get
to be imaginative.

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:02.140
You get to create and
you get to have fun.

00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:04.720
And it's tough, it's
a lot of hard work,

00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:08.560
but it's really fun to do both.

00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:09.860
Good question.

00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:11.160
&gt;&gt; My name is Jimar.

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:14.860
And I want to know when
you start your career?

00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:16.160
&gt;&gt; John Cena: Will?

00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:17.460
&gt;&gt; Started your career.

00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:20.470
&gt;&gt; John Cena: I'm
sorry, say again.

00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:24.610
&gt;&gt; When did you start
your career?

00:24:24.610 --> 00:24:27.610
&gt;&gt; John Cena: Oh,
when did I start.

00:24:27.610 --> 00:24:31.880
I'll answer that
question with a question.

00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:34.200
How old are you?

00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:35.500
&gt;&gt; Nine.

00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:38.540
&gt;&gt; John Cena: It might've been
well before you were born.

00:24:38.540 --> 00:24:40.840
So it's been a while,
it's been a while.

00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:45.690
I started my career
in 2002 on television,

00:24:45.690 --> 00:24:49.660
so it's been about 15 years.

00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:56.040
I see a lot of hands,
this is great.

00:24:57.230 --> 00:25:00.640
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter: We have a
question also from our friends

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:01.940
who are watching remotely.

00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:03.390
And this one's from
a fourth grader

00:25:03.390 --> 00:25:05.400
in Clarendon Elementary School.

00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:08.880
Did you listen to
the story as a child?

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:11.330
And did you relate to it then?

00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:14.380
&gt;&gt; John Cena: Well, as a child
I knew of this story and growing

00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:15.680
up I knew of this story.

00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:19.140
But amazingly enough, the first
time I actually read the book

00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:22.580
from cover to cover
was for this.

00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:23.880
And it was because I wanted

00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:25.960
to make sure it was
really important

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:27.750
to send a message of Ferdinand.

00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:31.780
So like you guys, I'm being
introduced to such a famous book

00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:34.830
and I can see now why it's
been around for so long

00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:37.660
and touched so many generations.

00:25:39.550 --> 00:25:44.500
&gt;&gt; Did you like acting with
people like Peyton Manning?

00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:47.830
&gt;&gt; John Cena: Well, I was very
thankful that I didn't have

00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:50.940
to play football
against Peyton Manning.

00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:52.670
But yes, he was very
funny and goofy

00:25:52.670 --> 00:25:59.780
and I thought he did an
excellent job in the movie.

00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:01.080
&gt;&gt; My name's Xavier.

00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:04.560
Was you ever scared when
you first got in the ring?

00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:07.620
&gt;&gt; John Cena: Was I ever scared
when I first got in the ring.

00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:08.980
I'm scared all the time.

00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:12.890
I was scared behind the door to
come out and talk to you guys.

00:26:12.890 --> 00:26:15.070
But it's your ability
to understand

00:26:15.070 --> 00:26:17.710
that you're doing something
awesome and you're going

00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:20.420
to be nervous and you're going
to doubt yourself at times,

00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:22.150
just like when I'm in the ring.

00:26:22.150 --> 00:26:25.690
But that's kind of
what life is about.

00:26:25.690 --> 00:26:28.360
It's kind of overcoming
your fears and being able

00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:30.940
to take chances to
do some cool stuff.

00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:32.240
So yes, I was nervous.

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:33.540
I'm always nervous.

00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:38.490
But I always do my best to
just go out there anyway.

00:26:38.490 --> 00:26:42.160
&gt;&gt; What was your
favorite sport before WWE?

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:43.460
&gt;&gt; John Cena: What is my?

00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:44.760
&gt;&gt; Favorite sport
before the WWE?

00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:46.130
&gt;&gt; John Cena: Say
again, I'm sorry.

00:26:46.130 --> 00:26:50.120
&gt;&gt; What was your
favorite sport before WWE?

00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:51.880
&gt;&gt; John Cena: Favorite
sport before WWE.

00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:53.990
Well, I played football
in high school

00:26:53.990 --> 00:26:55.290
and I played football
in college.

00:26:55.290 --> 00:26:56.590
So I'll have to say football.

00:26:56.590 --> 00:27:02.900
&gt;&gt; My name is Casia
and I'm in first grade.

00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:07.220
Ferdinand likes to
look at flowers.

00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:09.510
What do you like to do?

00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:10.910
&gt;&gt; John Cena: Say again.

00:27:10.910 --> 00:27:18.930
&gt;&gt; My name is Casia
and I'm in first grade.

00:27:18.930 --> 00:27:21.830
Ferdinand likes to
look at flowers.

00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:24.460
What do you like to do?

00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:25.760
&gt;&gt; John Cena: Ooh, okay.

00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:27.280
So Ferdinand likes flowers.

00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:28.760
What do I like to do.

00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:30.100
I also like flowers.

00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:31.890
My favorite flower is the rose.

00:27:31.890 --> 00:27:34.290
And a little known
fact about me.

00:27:34.290 --> 00:27:36.470
When sometimes I've
had a stressful day

00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:40.620
or a stressful week, I actually
like to sit and relax and,

00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:44.680
just like Ferdinand,
[sniffs] smell the flowers.

00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:48.560
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter: We
have another question

00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:50.050
from somebody who's
watching live.

00:27:50.050 --> 00:27:53.140
And this time they're asking
a question via Twitter.

00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:56.030
It's from somebody
called @JohnCenaCrew,

00:27:56.030 --> 00:27:58.040
so maybe they're a fan.

00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:00.240
If you were to do
another animated movie,

00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:01.740
what character would
you like to voice?

00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:05.480
&gt;&gt; John Cena: You know, the
animated universe is great

00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:08.960
because you can start with
nothing, or you can start

00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:12.220
with a short story, and
build a universe around it.

00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:16.520
So I guess it all depends on
the powerful subject matter.

00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:18.900
This was easy.

00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:21.500
They asked me if I wanted to
be Ferdinand and I was in.

00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:24.030
Because the subject
matter is great.

00:28:24.030 --> 00:28:26.750
And I knew the people
making the movie were great.

00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:28.740
So I knew they would
create a wonderful universe.

00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:30.880
So I don't know, hopefully
I get to do it again,

00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:34.480
and we'll see what happens.

00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:36.630
&gt;&gt; My name is Maximo.

00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:40.590
Would you like to continue
your wrestling streak

00:28:40.590 --> 00:28:42.070
or just smell the flowers?

00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:43.370
[laughter.]

00:28:43.370 --> 00:28:45.640
&gt;&gt; John Cena: Well, man,

00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:50.720
one is a little bit less
physically demanding.

00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:52.950
So there are times when I'd
rather smell the flowers,

00:28:52.950 --> 00:28:55.480
but I really do like
being able to perform

00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:56.780
for audiences, as you can tell.

00:28:56.780 --> 00:28:58.930
I really enjoy being
here with you guys.

00:28:58.930 --> 00:29:00.660
And there's nothing
more exciting

00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:02.130
than being in a WW ring.

00:29:02.130 --> 00:29:06.650
So I think I'm going
to go with that one.

00:29:06.650 --> 00:29:10.430
These are all great
questions, by the way.

00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:11.730
&gt;&gt; My name is Nilo.

00:29:11.730 --> 00:29:16.390
What is your favorite part
in the story of Ferdinand?

00:29:16.390 --> 00:29:18.930
&gt;&gt; John Cena: Okay,
that's a good question.

00:29:18.930 --> 00:29:25.120
I was peculiar why the
five men had funny hats.

00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:26.660
Because if you look
at the picture,

00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:29.220
they do have really,
really funny hats.

00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:31.690
And in the story I think
that's a nice little detail

00:29:31.690 --> 00:29:33.470
that the men had funny hats.

00:29:33.470 --> 00:29:37.090
But my favorite part
is when Ferdinand runs

00:29:37.090 --> 00:29:39.230
out into the middle of the arena
and everybody thinks he's going

00:29:39.230 --> 00:29:40.540
to fight really fierce.

00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:44.170
And it's because he sees all
the flowers and it reminds him

00:29:44.170 --> 00:29:46.610
of home, he sits down

00:29:46.610 --> 00:29:54.040
and is just enjoyably
happy smelling the flowers.

00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:57.650
&gt;&gt; What do people often think
about you which is wrong?

00:29:57.650 --> 00:30:00.860
&gt;&gt; John Cena: Oh, okay,
that's a great question.

00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:03.930
What do people often think
about me which is wrong.

00:30:03.930 --> 00:30:09.530
That I always kind of like to
be what you see on television.

00:30:09.530 --> 00:30:12.510
I truly enjoy my
time in the WWE,

00:30:12.510 --> 00:30:14.960
but I also enjoy a
lot of other stuff.

00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:18.540
And even if some people think
it doesn't make me look cool

00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:22.520
or seem tough, it doesn't
mean that I don't enjoy it.

00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:29.340
So I guess people think I'm
a big tough guy all the time,

00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:30.740
and that's wrong.

00:30:30.740 --> 00:30:32.110
&gt;&gt; My name is Lela.

00:30:32.110 --> 00:30:39.340
I wanted to know how you think
you would be the best part

00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:42.790
as Ferdinand when you
two are so different?

00:30:42.790 --> 00:30:45.390
&gt;&gt; John Cena: Say again.

00:30:45.390 --> 00:30:48.970
&gt;&gt; How would you think
you were the best part

00:30:48.970 --> 00:30:52.400
as Ferdinand in the movie?

00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:53.700
&gt;&gt; John Cena: Oh, okay.

00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:55.680
So this is going to sound weird.

00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:56.980
I think the best part

00:30:56.980 --> 00:31:00.610
in Ferdinand the movie is
played by the calming goat.

00:31:00.610 --> 00:31:02.070
Now here I am, I'm Ferdinand.

00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:04.090
So I mean, this is great.

00:31:04.090 --> 00:31:06.190
But my favorite character,
when you see the movie,

00:31:06.190 --> 00:31:07.490
is a calming goat named Lupe.

00:31:07.490 --> 00:31:10.200
And when Lupe shows up,
you'll understand why.

00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:13.730
So that's my favorite character.

00:31:13.730 --> 00:31:15.360
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter: This is a
question from Cameron who's

00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:18.550
in the fifth grade at the
Calverton School in Huntingtown.

00:31:18.550 --> 00:31:20.640
How would you explain
why reading is

00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:22.990
so important for children?

00:31:22.990 --> 00:31:26.560
&gt;&gt; John Cena: Well, what
a wonderful building to be

00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:28.540
in to answer that question.

00:31:28.540 --> 00:31:32.990
There is a small hallway
with a tile fixture

00:31:32.990 --> 00:31:35.810
that is extremely small
above one of the arches,

00:31:35.810 --> 00:31:38.860
that in brilliantly
laid tile simply says,

00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:41.490
"knowledge is power."

00:31:41.490 --> 00:31:43.590
And that couldn't
be more correct.

00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:46.550
And in a place with
almost unlimited knowledge

00:31:46.550 --> 00:31:50.150
as the books keep pouring in and
the materials keep pouring in,

00:31:50.150 --> 00:31:53.690
it's certainly important to
be sharp and be educated.

00:31:53.690 --> 00:31:55.360
Because with knowledge
comes power.

00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:59.110
So that is why reading
is important.

00:31:59.110 --> 00:32:01.020
&gt;&gt; My name is Emily.

00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:04.230
And how long was auditioning?

00:32:04.230 --> 00:32:07.580
&gt;&gt; John Cena: Whew,
man, it was tough.

00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:12.050
They had me talk a lot.

00:32:12.050 --> 00:32:13.430
No, I'm just kidding.

00:32:13.430 --> 00:32:15.700
It was very, very fun.

00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:19.120
Because amazingly enough,
the people that animate,

00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:22.150
the people that draw,
they're like big kids.

00:32:22.150 --> 00:32:24.510
They're so fun to be
around, because they want

00:32:24.510 --> 00:32:26.660
to make these crazy
things and these wild

00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:28.370
and imaginative things happen.

00:32:28.370 --> 00:32:31.750
So the audition was easy
because I'm like a big kid too.

00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:33.060
So we just kind of hit it off.

00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:36.350
And we were like, well, so are
we going to make this movie?

00:32:36.350 --> 00:32:39.950
And they're like, yeah,
let's make this movie.

00:32:39.950 --> 00:32:41.950
And we did it.

00:32:41.950 --> 00:32:44.270
&gt;&gt; Why did you want
to be Ferdinand?

00:32:44.270 --> 00:32:47.640
&gt;&gt; John Cena: Well, I think
Ferdinand's really cool.

00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:50.870
Because in the book, you
can see that he doesn't want

00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:52.760
to do what the other bulls do.

00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:55.320
And like his mom
worries about him a lot.

00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:58.300
But once she takes the time
to talk with Ferdinand,

00:32:58.300 --> 00:33:01.420
she then is like, no,
he's going be okay.

00:33:01.420 --> 00:33:04.930
So I think it's really
important that even

00:33:04.930 --> 00:33:07.000
if you do something
different that a ton

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.860
of people don't do even when
they're pressuring you to do it,

00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:11.800
it doesn't mean you
can't be happy.

00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:13.830
So I thought that
was a pretty fun

00:33:13.830 --> 00:33:18.680
and important message to send.

00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:20.140
&gt;&gt; My name is Alex.

00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:23.880
And who's your enemy in WWE?

00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:27.940
&gt;&gt; John Cena: Well,
there's an old saying

00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:30.650
that you are your
own worst enemy.

00:33:30.650 --> 00:33:32.610
So it's probably
me at sometimes.

00:33:32.610 --> 00:33:37.780
You know, I don't really have
any archenemies I would say.

00:33:37.780 --> 00:33:40.140
It's really just a very
competitive environment

00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:42.020
where we all want
to be champion.

00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:45.190
So I guess when me
giving you that answer,

00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:51.750
whoever is the champion.

00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:53.050
&gt;&gt; My name is Jayden.

00:33:53.050 --> 00:33:56.890
And who is your wrestler
in the WWE?

00:33:56.890 --> 00:33:59.830
&gt;&gt; John Cena: My favorite
wrestler of all time,

00:33:59.830 --> 00:34:01.300
that's a good question.

00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:04.600
I know when I was your age,
I really liked Hulk Hogan,

00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:05.900
because I thought he was

00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:07.950
like larger-than-life
and a superhero.

00:34:07.950 --> 00:34:12.300
Now it is, hmm, this is
going to sound weird,

00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:13.610
I would say my favorite

00:34:13.610 --> 00:34:16.480
of all time is a tie
between two people.

00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:19.070
One, Vince McMahon,
because I think he's one

00:34:19.070 --> 00:34:22.040
of the greatest performers
ever in WWE.

00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:25.130
Two, and I would say a
tie, I would say a tie,

00:34:25.130 --> 00:34:26.430
is The Rock [applause].

00:34:26.430 --> 00:34:34.230
He's just got an
electricity like no other.

00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:42.960
And the eyebrow thing,
I can't do it.

00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:44.260
[laughter].

00:34:44.260 --> 00:34:45.560
&gt;&gt; Hi. My name's Naomi.

00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:48.330
And I want to ask, do
you do your own stunts?

00:34:48.330 --> 00:34:50.000
&gt;&gt; John Cena: Do I
do my own stunts.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:53.800
Actually, it's a very elaborate
process when we film a WW event,

00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:57.120
that I do all the
talky-talky, and then right

00:34:57.120 --> 00:35:00.260
when we have a chance to do
action, we stop and a guy

00:35:00.260 --> 00:35:03.990
who looks like me comes in and
does my own stunts [laughter].

00:35:03.990 --> 00:35:06.830
It would be easier if we just
did -- yes, I do my own stunts.

00:35:06.830 --> 00:35:10.680
I knew that one wasn't
going to hold

00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:13.590
up for more than two seconds.

00:35:13.590 --> 00:35:15.460
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter: A question
from online from Summer,

00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:17.590
fourth grader in
Clarendon Elementary.

00:35:17.590 --> 00:35:20.380
What do you imagine
yourself doing in 10 years?

00:35:20.380 --> 00:35:24.700
&gt;&gt; John Cena: I just hope that
I can continue to tell stories

00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:26.800
and actually call it work.

00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:29.850
This is the greatest
thing to be able to do,

00:35:29.850 --> 00:35:33.340
to be able to work hard,
but at the end of the day,

00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:34.640
something that you love.

00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:37.260
So if 10 years from now I can
continue to keep doing this,

00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:38.970
it's going to be great.

00:35:38.970 --> 00:35:43.170
So hopefully I can.

00:35:43.170 --> 00:35:46.800
&gt;&gt; My name is Charlotte.

00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:52.630
And my brother loves your story.

00:35:52.630 --> 00:35:55.720
&gt;&gt; John Cena: Well,
thank you very much.

00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:57.020
[laughter].

00:35:57.020 --> 00:35:58.320
Thank you.

00:35:58.320 --> 00:35:59.890
You know, it was about time
we had a statement instead

00:35:59.890 --> 00:36:01.190
of a question.

00:36:01.190 --> 00:36:08.100
And that was a very good
one, it was a very good one.

00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:10.740
&gt;&gt; My name is Devon.

00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:13.230
And why did you quit WWE?

00:36:13.230 --> 00:36:15.690
Why did you quit WWE?

00:36:15.690 --> 00:36:16.990
&gt;&gt; John Cena: That's
a good question.

00:36:16.990 --> 00:36:18.290
I don't why anybody
would quit WWE.

00:36:18.290 --> 00:36:23.120
I mean, I'm just going to give
you a little spoiler alert.

00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:25.800
I'm still there.

00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:27.570
So here's the thing,
here's the lowdown.

00:36:27.570 --> 00:36:31.130
Very interesting question,
because I'm not there right now.

00:36:31.130 --> 00:36:35.900
So what happens is -- so I've
got this full-time job with WWE.

00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:37.890
And then the phone rings
and somebody's like, hey,

00:36:37.890 --> 00:36:39.290
man, you want another job?

00:36:39.290 --> 00:36:42.470
And I say, well, yeah, but
like I can't let this one go.

00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:43.770
And they're like,
well, that's cool,

00:36:43.770 --> 00:36:45.070
just take a little break
and then come back.

00:36:45.070 --> 00:36:46.370
I'm like, whoa, really?

00:36:46.370 --> 00:36:47.670
And they're like yeah.

00:36:47.670 --> 00:36:48.970
And I'm like, all right, cool.

00:36:48.970 --> 00:36:56.520
So I'm kind of doing
two jobs at once.

00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:59.820
&gt;&gt; So my name is Rashard.

00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:02.650
I was thinking, as
soon as you were a kid,

00:37:02.650 --> 00:37:06.350
did you ever think you were
going to make it in the WWE?

00:37:06.350 --> 00:37:08.560
&gt;&gt; John Cena: Not for a second.

00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:10.820
I looked at those
WWE superstars.

00:37:10.820 --> 00:37:14.110
I was like, man, there's no
way I could ever do that.

00:37:14.110 --> 00:37:16.620
But that was when
I was a little kid.

00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:19.210
I always kept it my mind
that if I worked hard

00:37:19.210 --> 00:37:21.020
that maybe I'd have a chance.

00:37:21.020 --> 00:37:24.680
And when I got a chance, I
wasn't a superstar overnight.

00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:28.470
It was a lot of -- I
swung and missed a lot.

00:37:28.470 --> 00:37:32.580
But through hard work and not
giving up, I eventually --

00:37:32.580 --> 00:37:33.880
it took a very long time,

00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:35.580
but I eventually
became a WWE superstar.

00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:39.330
But as a young kid I
didn't think I'd make it.

00:37:39.330 --> 00:37:43.380
&gt;&gt; My name is Hanas and
I've got a question.

00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:47.110
How do you make a
connection with Ferdinand?

00:37:47.110 --> 00:37:49.260
&gt;&gt; John Cena: How do I make
a connection with Ferdinand?

00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:52.830
Well, here's the cool
thing about Ferdinand.

00:37:52.830 --> 00:37:56.180
I think everybody in this
room can make a connection

00:37:56.180 --> 00:37:57.480
with Ferdinand.

00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:58.910
Because we all interact
with a bunch

00:37:58.910 --> 00:38:00.930
of people every day,
if you look around.

00:38:00.930 --> 00:38:04.110
We all can look around in the
room and everybody's different.

00:38:04.110 --> 00:38:07.540
And at one point or
another, probably everybody

00:38:07.540 --> 00:38:10.620
in this room has
been misunderstood.

00:38:10.620 --> 00:38:13.580
And if you've been misunderstood
for even one second,

00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:15.220
whether you know it or not,

00:38:15.220 --> 00:38:18.140
you have a connection
with Ferdinand.

00:38:20.410 --> 00:38:21.990
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter:
This is the question

00:38:21.990 --> 00:38:23.870
from Devon, a fifth grader.

00:38:23.870 --> 00:38:26.210
What children's book
did you enjoy as a child

00:38:26.210 --> 00:38:28.940
that touched your
heart like Ferdinand?

00:38:28.940 --> 00:38:33.390
&gt;&gt; John Cena: Well, we've talked
about the mechanical obsession

00:38:33.390 --> 00:38:34.900
that I had as a young kid.

00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:38.840
I'll even say again that aside
from "Cars and Trucks and Things

00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:41.010
That Go," I also
gravitated towards a lot

00:38:41.010 --> 00:38:42.800
of the works of Dr. Seuss.

00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:47.450
I thought Dr. Seuss was a
wonderful way of telling stories

00:38:47.450 --> 00:38:51.220
and his worlds were so
bizarre and imaginative,

00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:54.690
that as a kid I really
gravitated toward Dr. Seuss

00:38:54.690 --> 00:38:56.580
as well.

00:38:56.580 --> 00:38:58.060
&gt;&gt; My name is Delaney.

00:38:58.060 --> 00:39:02.760
Do you know why they decided
to film Ferdinand this year?

00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:07.930
&gt;&gt; John Cena: Why they decided
to make Ferdinand this year.

00:39:07.930 --> 00:39:11.840
Well, believe it or not, the
guy who directed Ferdinand,

00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:14.730
the studio that made
Ferdinand, started on this move

00:39:14.730 --> 00:39:17.840
in 2010, seven years ago.

00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:20.370
So it took seven years
to make the movie.

00:39:20.370 --> 00:39:25.360
And why they waited till
2010, I have no idea.

00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:28.210
This is also a fact
about the movie.

00:39:28.210 --> 00:39:30.730
It was an animated movie
way back in the day.

00:39:30.730 --> 00:39:32.460
It was about six minutes long.

00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:34.780
And it very, very well-received.

00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:36.720
It won a bunch of awards.

00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:39.840
So I think maybe because it
already was a shorter animated

00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:45.020
movie is why they waited so long
to make it a big animated movie.

00:39:45.020 --> 00:39:46.620
&gt;&gt; My name is Neoni.

00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:51.120
And I want to know, do you
think you will carry a legacy?

00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:52.640
&gt;&gt; John Cena: Do I think?

00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:55.630
&gt;&gt; You will carry a legacy?

00:39:55.630 --> 00:39:56.930
&gt;&gt; John Cena: Do I think
I'll carry a legacy?

00:39:56.930 --> 00:39:58.230
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:39:58.230 --> 00:39:59.530
&gt;&gt; John Cena: That's
for you guys to decide.

00:39:59.530 --> 00:40:00.830
It's okay.

00:40:00.830 --> 00:40:03.780
Whether I do or not,
I'm having a fun time

00:40:03.780 --> 00:40:06.750
and I'm doing what I enjoy,
and that's most important.

00:40:08.410 --> 00:40:09.890
&gt;&gt; My name is Kumani.

00:40:09.890 --> 00:40:14.320
And what's the hardest
challenge or struggle you faced?

00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:16.810
&gt;&gt; John Cena: Not
enough hours in the day.

00:40:16.810 --> 00:40:19.660
Like I want to be able
to do all this cool stuff

00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:21.530
and then the day just runs out.

00:40:21.530 --> 00:40:24.390
So maybe if there was a
little more time in the day,

00:40:24.390 --> 00:40:27.020
I could be able to
do more fun stuff.

00:40:27.020 --> 00:40:30.810
But for the most part,
it's all pretty cool,

00:40:30.810 --> 00:40:35.470
just not enough time.

00:40:35.470 --> 00:40:38.860
&gt;&gt; Hi. My name is Tyree.

00:40:38.860 --> 00:40:42.440
What do you practice at for WWE?

00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:45.840
&gt;&gt; John Cena: Well, I practice
at my trash talk [laughter].

00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:49.360
Keep that real sharp, just

00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:51.380
in case somebody trash
talks against you.

00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:54.280
Practice on my fitness.

00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:55.870
Make sure I'm real strong.

00:40:55.870 --> 00:40:58.430
Because sometimes
you've got to be strong.

00:40:58.430 --> 00:41:01.710
And one more thing, and this
is something I practice on --

00:41:01.710 --> 00:41:05.960
and you guys can watch WWE
and know that I'm not kidding.

00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:08.030
I practice on my tolerance.

00:41:08.030 --> 00:41:11.760
Because the audience is
everybody from around the world,

00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:14.600
and there are some groups
of the audience that like me

00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:17.330
and there are some groups of
the audience that don't like me.

00:41:17.330 --> 00:41:19.550
And when those groups that
don't like me yell really,

00:41:19.550 --> 00:41:22.670
really loud that I'm not any
good, I don't turn around

00:41:22.670 --> 00:41:24.880
and say, hey, you
can't say that.

00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:26.760
Because they can say that.

00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:28.670
So it's actually,
believe it or not,

00:41:28.670 --> 00:41:33.270
my time in the WWE has made
me have a greater appreciation

00:41:33.270 --> 00:41:34.570
for all of you out there.

00:41:34.570 --> 00:41:38.540
So that's the thing I
practice the most is tolerance.

00:41:38.540 --> 00:41:39.840
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter: A
question from Charlie

00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:41.170
who is a fourth grader.

00:41:41.170 --> 00:41:44.420
How did you come up with the
phrase, "you can't see me"?

00:41:44.420 --> 00:41:45.720
&gt;&gt; John Cena: Ooh,
how did I come

00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:47.970
up with the phrase,
"you can't see me"?

00:41:47.970 --> 00:41:50.930
So I can't take credit for it.

00:41:50.930 --> 00:41:54.000
My youngest brother Sean -- who
doesn't go by the name Sean.

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:55.370
We call him Boog.

00:41:55.370 --> 00:42:00.070
So my youngest brother Boog
dared me to do it on television.

00:42:00.070 --> 00:42:04.210
The very first time I played
him my theme song, he heard it

00:42:04.210 --> 00:42:06.380
and he was like, man, that's
awesome and he started dancing

00:42:06.380 --> 00:42:08.150
and he started doing
something like this.

00:42:08.150 --> 00:42:10.250
And I was like, you
look ridiculous.

00:42:10.250 --> 00:42:13.050
He's like, ridiculous enough
for you to do it on TV?

00:42:13.050 --> 00:42:14.350
And I said, of course.

00:42:14.350 --> 00:42:18.280
And back then, nobody
watched my matches,

00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:20.780
so I didn't think anybody
was paying attention.

00:42:20.780 --> 00:42:26.720
So right away I got a guy
down and "you can't see me."

00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:28.950
And now I've been
doing it for 15 years.

00:42:28.950 --> 00:42:30.290
And nobody can actually see me.

00:42:30.290 --> 00:42:31.870
I'm actually really invisible.

00:42:31.870 --> 00:42:36.450
It's quite fascinating.

00:42:36.450 --> 00:42:37.780
&gt;&gt; My name is Lilly.

00:42:37.780 --> 00:42:41.680
And my question is, how do
you get into starting --

00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:48.520
like how did you like -- why
did you want to start wrestling?

00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:50.610
&gt;&gt; John Cena: So I
wanted to start wrestling

00:42:50.610 --> 00:42:52.060
because I've always
been pretty strong.

00:42:52.060 --> 00:42:56.070
I've always been in
pretty good shape.

00:42:56.070 --> 00:42:59.680
And I really, really,
really enjoy it.

00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:01.260
I like to watch the programs.

00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:02.870
I like to keep up
on the superstars.

00:43:02.870 --> 00:43:06.830
It's something that I enjoy
even though I'm not involved.

00:43:06.830 --> 00:43:11.000
So it's essentially
like a dream come true.

00:43:20.830 --> 00:43:22.920
&gt;&gt; My name is Jackson.

00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:27.910
And I wonder if you ever got
bullied at school before?

00:43:27.910 --> 00:43:30.500
&gt;&gt; John Cena: Oh,
yes, yes I did.

00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:34.520
Not only in school, and as a
young man I was bullied a lot.

00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:36.030
Because I didn't look
like everybody else.

00:43:36.030 --> 00:43:38.590
Because I didn't talk
like everybody else.

00:43:38.590 --> 00:43:40.920
And it was some very
difficult times.

00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:43.520
Bullying is very
difficult to deal with.

00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:44.820
But here's the thing.

00:43:44.820 --> 00:43:48.240
I get bullied every day, with
the advent of social media

00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:51.190
and everyone that can
comment on your page.

00:43:51.190 --> 00:43:54.260
A lot of people tell me that
I'm really not any good.

00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:56.510
I've been called
pretty much everything.

00:43:56.510 --> 00:43:59.160
But like I said, my
experience with all you guys

00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:02.230
over the years has
taught me great tolerance.

00:44:02.230 --> 00:44:05.350
And the best advice I can
give you after all that,

00:44:05.350 --> 00:44:07.410
just don't pay it any mind.

00:44:07.410 --> 00:44:09.510
Certainly tell someone about it.

00:44:09.510 --> 00:44:10.830
But don't sweat it.

00:44:10.830 --> 00:44:13.430
Those people really are just
wasting their time anyway.

00:44:13.430 --> 00:44:16.940
And chances are more often
than not, they're going

00:44:16.940 --> 00:44:19.220
through some issues that
they can't really deal with.

00:44:19.220 --> 00:44:21.860
So yes, I was bullied
then, I'm bullied now,

00:44:21.860 --> 00:44:27.590
but I don't pay it
any mind at all.

00:44:27.590 --> 00:44:29.060
&gt;&gt; Hi. My name is Wyndom.

00:44:29.060 --> 00:44:32.650
And do you like doing
animated movies or movies

00:44:32.650 --> 00:44:34.270
like the Fred movies more?

00:44:34.270 --> 00:44:37.570
&gt;&gt; John Cena: So I like
doing animated movies,

00:44:37.570 --> 00:44:41.670
because I'm not very
animated with my own body.

00:44:41.670 --> 00:44:46.310
Kidding. I enjoy both.

00:44:46.310 --> 00:44:49.290
And everyone often asks me,
well, what do you like more,

00:44:49.290 --> 00:44:52.130
WWE or movies or do you
like animated movies

00:44:52.130 --> 00:44:54.760
or doing the Fred movies?

00:44:54.760 --> 00:44:57.650
It's simply the ability to
create and tell a story.

00:44:57.650 --> 00:45:01.110
It's like one day painting
in paints and then the next

00:45:01.110 --> 00:45:03.570
with pen and then
the next with crayon.

00:45:03.570 --> 00:45:06.550
You still get to
make art or clay

00:45:06.550 --> 00:45:07.910
but it's just different forms.

00:45:07.910 --> 00:45:14.470
&gt;&gt; Have you ever had a
dream that you accomplished?

00:45:14.470 --> 00:45:18.640
&gt;&gt; John Cena: Have I
ever had a dream that?

00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:21.680
&gt;&gt; You accomplished?

00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:25.880
&gt;&gt; John Cena: Ooh, I
mean, every single day.

00:45:25.880 --> 00:45:28.690
I'm able to live a
dream every single day.

00:45:28.690 --> 00:45:31.350
Although I have this
one weird dream.

00:45:31.350 --> 00:45:33.960
But no, I'll talk about that
later, that's okay [laughter].

00:45:36.350 --> 00:45:37.650
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter:
This is a question

00:45:37.650 --> 00:45:39.010
from Robert, fifth grader.

00:45:39.010 --> 00:45:41.160
As a kid did you ever
get your peer-pressured?

00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:42.820
And if so, what did you do?

00:45:42.820 --> 00:45:46.610
If you saw someone else being
teased, what did you do?

00:45:46.610 --> 00:45:49.870
&gt;&gt; John Cena: You know, I was
peer-pressured a lot as a kid.

00:45:49.870 --> 00:45:51.730
I mean, I think I'm
peer-pressured now

00:45:51.730 --> 00:45:53.030
as an adult as well.

00:45:53.030 --> 00:45:54.560
And we all are, guys.

00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:58.040
You know, we go to school
with a bunch of people

00:45:58.040 --> 00:46:00.400
and there are groups of kids
that maybe we want to be with

00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:01.700
and there are groups of kids

00:46:01.700 --> 00:46:04.310
that maybe we don't
mesh so well with.

00:46:04.310 --> 00:46:07.630
And we always kind of try
to find out who we are

00:46:07.630 --> 00:46:09.570
and where we we're
going to go in life.

00:46:09.570 --> 00:46:13.450
And sometimes we let people
make those decisions for us.

00:46:13.450 --> 00:46:18.450
And every single time I've let
those folks make a decision

00:46:18.450 --> 00:46:22.250
for me, it has really
wound up disastrous.

00:46:22.250 --> 00:46:24.070
So I guess my advice
when it comes

00:46:24.070 --> 00:46:27.220
to peer pressure is just
listen to everything around you

00:46:27.220 --> 00:46:28.650
and be aware of everything
around you

00:46:28.650 --> 00:46:31.010
but make your own choice.

00:46:31.010 --> 00:46:33.500
Because then at least
you'll be happy with it

00:46:33.500 --> 00:46:35.780
at the end of the day.

00:46:35.780 --> 00:46:37.080
&gt;&gt; My name is SJ.

00:46:37.080 --> 00:46:39.080
And can you do 1000 push-ups?

00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:40.480
[laughter].

00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:42.410
&gt;&gt; John Cena: I can.

00:46:42.410 --> 00:46:46.340
I can easily do 1000
push-ups if I start now

00:46:46.340 --> 00:46:48.940
and end in 2020 [laughter].

00:46:48.940 --> 00:46:52.770
But I'm not going to start now.

00:46:52.770 --> 00:46:57.300
We're just going to speculate
that I can do the 1000 push-ups.

00:46:57.300 --> 00:46:58.600
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter: All right.

00:46:58.600 --> 00:47:00.740
We're going to take one
last round of questions.

00:47:00.740 --> 00:47:03.840
So this is my last question here
and then we'll head over there,

00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:06.920
there, and back, okay?

00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:08.700
&gt;&gt; My name is Wesley.

00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:11.160
And what does it feel
like to be a role model

00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:13.410
out of the ring and in the ring?

00:47:13.410 --> 00:47:15.950
&gt;&gt; John Cena: That's
very kind words.

00:47:15.950 --> 00:47:19.640
I think that's a -- I
owe you a thank you, sir.

00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:24.380
That means -- for someone
like you to say that means you

00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:27.650
and a bunch of people around you
are actually paying attention

00:47:27.650 --> 00:47:31.860
to what I do and you
absorb the message I send.

00:47:31.860 --> 00:47:34.620
And it means more than you know.

00:47:34.620 --> 00:47:36.250
So I mean it when
I say thank you.

00:47:36.250 --> 00:47:38.550
That's very cool of you.

00:47:40.230 --> 00:47:43.300
&gt;&gt; Hi. My name is Nigel Porter
and I'm in the fifth grade.

00:47:43.300 --> 00:47:47.680
When did you think that
you were very famous?

00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:49.910
&gt;&gt; John Cena: When did I
find out I was very talented?

00:47:49.910 --> 00:47:51.740
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:47:51.740 --> 00:47:56.620
&gt;&gt; John Cena: Oh, so
you're saying I'm talented?

00:47:56.620 --> 00:47:59.650
I think we just became
best buds.

00:47:59.650 --> 00:48:00.950
Thank you so much.

00:48:00.950 --> 00:48:03.900
I don't know, man.

00:48:03.900 --> 00:48:07.290
I just -- I try to
work really hard

00:48:07.290 --> 00:48:10.810
and do the best I can
every time I get a chance,

00:48:10.810 --> 00:48:12.520
but I'm still looking
for that talent.

00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:14.000
Maybe one day I'll find it.

00:48:22.290 --> 00:48:24.330
&gt;&gt; My name is Angela.

00:48:24.330 --> 00:48:27.900
What is your favorite thing
in the whole wide world?

00:48:27.900 --> 00:48:29.200
&gt;&gt; John Cena: Favorite thing

00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:32.270
in the whole wide world besides
ice cream and pizza, you ask?

00:48:32.270 --> 00:48:34.800
Hmm, that's a great question.

00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:37.950
I love making people happy, man.

00:48:37.950 --> 00:48:40.170
It's a really good
feeling when you can --

00:48:40.170 --> 00:48:43.290
when you can do something and
put a smile on somebody's face.

00:48:43.290 --> 00:48:47.230
I guess that's why I do
all the stuff that I do.

00:48:47.230 --> 00:48:50.970
I really like making
people happy.

00:48:50.970 --> 00:48:52.270
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter:
This is a question

00:48:52.270 --> 00:48:53.570
from Cameron in fifth grade.

00:48:53.570 --> 00:48:55.080
Did you have a childhood
nickname

00:48:55.080 --> 00:48:57.260
and how did it make you feel?

00:48:57.260 --> 00:48:58.560
&gt;&gt; John Cena: Yeah,

00:48:58.560 --> 00:49:03.330
so my childhood nickname
was John Cena.

00:49:03.330 --> 00:49:07.250
Which, in the world of WWE,
with these awesome performers

00:49:07.250 --> 00:49:11.550
like Stone Cold and Hulk Hogan
and The Rock and The Undertaker,

00:49:11.550 --> 00:49:12.850
they just wanted
to use my nickname.

00:49:12.850 --> 00:49:14.940
So I'm John Cena [laughter].

00:49:14.940 --> 00:49:19.430
I should have planned
that one better.

00:49:19.430 --> 00:49:23.350
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter: And
the very last question.

00:49:23.350 --> 00:49:25.470
&gt;&gt; My name is Antoinette.

00:49:25.470 --> 00:49:28.400
And could you could how
many matches you've won?

00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:30.250
&gt;&gt; John Cena: Say it again?

00:49:30.250 --> 00:49:33.780
&gt;&gt; Could you count how
many matches you've won?

00:49:33.780 --> 00:49:36.820
&gt;&gt; How many matches you won.

00:49:36.820 --> 00:49:38.120
&gt;&gt; John Cena: Could
I -- I'm sorry, what?

00:49:38.120 --> 00:49:39.760
&gt;&gt; How many matches
you have won.

00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:41.490
&gt;&gt; John Cena: Oh, how
many matches have I won?

00:49:41.490 --> 00:49:51.510
Well, I've won at least 16
because I have 16 championships.

00:49:51.510 --> 00:49:57.860
[ Applause ]

00:49:57.860 --> 00:49:59.980
And just keep in mind,
in the whole winning

00:49:59.980 --> 00:50:02.320
and losing thing -- in baseball,

00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:04.250
if you only get a hit
three times out of 10,

00:50:04.250 --> 00:50:05.550
you go into the Hall of Fame.

00:50:05.550 --> 00:50:07.220
So kind of -- if you go by
that model, I'm doing okay.

00:50:07.220 --> 00:50:09.780
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter: All right.

00:50:09.780 --> 00:50:13.560
You guys, your questions
were absolutely fabulous.

00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:18.510
Let's give him one
more round [applause].

00:50:18.510 --> 00:50:20.310
&gt;&gt; John Cena: Thank
you, everybody.

00:50:20.310 --> 00:50:28.130
[ Applause ]

00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:32.230
I just want to say thanks,
not only for your questions

00:50:32.230 --> 00:50:33.750
but for everybody being patient.

00:50:33.750 --> 00:50:39.280
And although I am here now, I'm
going to step over there so,

00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:42.460
legitimately, in the count
of three, you can't see me.

00:50:42.460 --> 00:50:44.510
Thank you.

00:50:44.510 --> 00:50:48.540
[ Applause ]

00:50:48.540 --> 00:50:52.190

of the Library of Congress.
