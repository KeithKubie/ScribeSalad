BRENDON HARRINGTON:
We talked before-- you

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:07.460
know, the programs that we're
trying to do here at Google,

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:10.180
there's a lot of overlap,
a lot of similarity.

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:12.640
And yet one of the challenges
we face, especially

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.710
in places like LA, as
you mentioned-- we do

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.050
have an LA office,
the Bay Area--

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.980
is they don't want
to drive necessarily,

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.440
but then there's not a good
alternative for them, right?

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.230
So one of the challenges we face
is advocating for improvements

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.115
to the transportation
infrastructure.

00:00:27.115 --> 00:00:29.570
What are some of your
thoughts about how to do that?

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.160
STANA KATIC: It comes down
to engaging with lawmakers.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.760
But lawmakers have a
tough go, because they

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.750
have to answer to a bunch
of different parties.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.430
And one of the biggest
elements that lawmakers

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.020
are responsible
for is maintaining

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.050
the economics of a town.

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.350
So businesses play a big role.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.860
And sometimes what
we've found is

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.340
that businesses are concerned
that by having a bike

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:56.919
lane in front of
their storefront

00:00:56.919 --> 00:00:58.460
they might lose foot
traffic, or they

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.140
might lose traffic in general.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.300
And so what we are
trying to do right now

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:09.110
is we are meeting
with app developers

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.390
and trying to find the
right partnership to create

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.710
an app that would not just act
kind of like a map that gives

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.350
you the real time movement of
public transit in the area,

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.490
but it would also be a social
space where people could

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.640
discuss what bike lanes
look like at various points

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:32.200
of the day.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.180
They can say, hey,
this intersection

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.440
is terrible between
noon and 2 o'clock.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.000
Be careful there.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.840
They can rate places
kind of like Waze does.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.760
And we can also talk
about subway stops,

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.260
so that we can make the
infrastructure more-- we

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:51.920
can make it safer.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.520
And in addition to
that, what we're

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.360
looking to do is by getting
the data and comparing it,

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.110
let's say, to the
improved economics,

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.600
because we have
statistics, but they're

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.290
scattered throughout the US.

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.960
By saying, hey,
businesses in Los Angeles,

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.850
businesses in San
Francisco, when

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.490
you have a bike lane in
front of your storefront,

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.670
you end up increasing
revenue by 179%, which

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.340
we saw in a Texas city, right?

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.070
So if we're able to give
them statistical proof,

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.580
and we're able to arm
government officials,

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.520
then they're going to be
able to go to businesses

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.680
and go to their constituency
and justify some of the improved

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:35.880
infrastructure.

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.506
And so that's where
we're at right now.

00:02:37.506 --> 00:02:38.880
BRENDON HARRINGTON:
That's great.

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.800
So yeah, you're
talking about people

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.980
have barriers to using
alternate modes, right?

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.810
And so sometimes it actually
is the infrastructure.

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.060
Bike lanes is a great example.

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.750
And we've experienced that,
I know, in the Bay Area.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:48.990
Probably in a lot
of our other offices

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:50.965
as well, where they'll build
this beautiful bike lane

00:02:50.965 --> 00:02:52.632
and it goes right to
city limits, right?

00:02:52.632 --> 00:02:54.298
And then there's no
cross-jurisdictional

00:02:54.298 --> 00:02:54.950
coordination.

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.730
Do you see there being a
role in the use of technology

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:58.680
as one good example?

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.280
Are there other roles
where we can advocate

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.010
for that kind of
cross-jurisdictional or

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.835
regional mindset to
improve transportation

00:03:04.835 --> 00:03:06.120
on a wider basis?

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.870
STANA KATIC: Yeah.

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.660
I mean, I think it's going to
come down to arming lawmakers

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.035
with what they need in order
to build the infrastructure.

00:03:12.035 --> 00:03:17.220
It comes down to us
advocating for it.

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.540
It's simple economics--
supply and demand.

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.040
So if we demand it and if we're
using the infrastructure more,

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.870
than the government and
the institutions that

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.920
are responsible for
building projects like that,

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.775
they have no choice
but to supply it.

00:03:33.775 --> 00:03:35.150
BRENDON HARRINGTON:
That's great.

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.950
So that's on the technology and
kind of infrastructure side.

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.325
A lot of your presentation--
which I think is fantastic--

00:03:40.325 --> 00:03:42.471
is more about encouraging
people's behavior change,

00:03:42.471 --> 00:03:42.970
right?

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:43.190
STANA KATIC: Right.

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.670
BRENDON HARRINGTON:
So it's one thing

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:44.630
to have the
infrastructure, but it's

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.671
another thing to just kind
of get over that hump.

00:03:46.671 --> 00:03:49.990
One thing that we talked about
before, we like to illustrate

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:51.662
is, for bicycling, for instance.

00:03:51.662 --> 00:03:53.370
There's people that
already bike to work.

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.840
And that's great.

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.090
And we want you to
keep doing that.

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.960
And then there's
people who are never

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:56.880
going to bike no matter what.

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.070
We'll just leave
you alone, right.

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:59.490
But there's that middle
group of, you know, I

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:00.510
might be willing to bike.

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.350
But there's something about
it that I'm not sure about.

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:03.349
STANA KATIC: Huge group.

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:05.665
It's like 60% of
cyclists [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:05.665 --> 00:04:08.290
BRENDON HARRINGTON: So what are
some strategies that you think,

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.230
or you've seen that are
most important for us

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.780
to kind of consider as we
influence that group to change

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:13.480
their behavior.

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.940
STANA KATIC: Well, we know that
safety is an important one.

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.564
So you're looking at
the first and last mile.

00:04:18.564 --> 00:04:20.730
And again, it has to do
with building infrastructure

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:24.340
and making the roadways safe.

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.205
And it's not just about
educating cyclists.

00:04:26.205 --> 00:04:31.190
It's also about
educating car drivers.

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.470
Drivers.

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:36.260
So Long Beach is
doing a great job

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.370
of building a lot of
bicycle infrastructure.

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:42.180
And one of the things
that they've done

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.950
is they've slowly
educated the car community

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:50.780
about the new bike
infrastructure.

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.415
And they built these
really bold green lanes

00:04:53.415 --> 00:04:55.240
so that there's no
way you can miss it.

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.610
So before bikes are
even put on the streets,

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.540
cars are getting
accustomed to the new ways

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:05.762
around town, and how to
be protective of cyclists.

00:05:05.762 --> 00:05:06.970
So I think that's part of it.

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:09.480
I think starting
young too, if you

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:13.130
can find a way of
getting families

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:16.320
to travel alternatively, then
it becomes a part of the norm.

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.005
There's no reason
for us in the-- we're

00:05:19.005 --> 00:05:21.230
in the 21st century.

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:23.830
This stuff should be
kind of like a no-brainer

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:24.440
at this point.

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:27.720
It's beneficial for your
health, for the environment,

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.010
and I think even for
a social experience.

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:32.910
It makes spaces safer.

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:37.150
So with that in mind, if
we can encourage children

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:39.840
to think of this as
normal, then we're

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.530
going to create adults who will
have their own families who

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:44.885
will do this kind of
activity regularly,

00:05:44.885 --> 00:05:47.710
and who will demand that
out of their own towns

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:49.139
and out of their own experience.

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:50.430
And then we've got millennials.

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:51.763
I could talk about this forever.

00:05:51.763 --> 00:05:52.990
Sorry.

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:54.820
But millennials are
changing it as well.

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:55.320
You know.

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.520
They're demanding more out
of their life experience.

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.750
They want to be able to
have time to socialize.

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:04.300
And they aren't necessarily
investing in cars

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:05.850
like previous generations have.

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:10.060
They're investing in
the next and best cell

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:12.600
phone, the next and best
laptop, the next best

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:13.940
whatever technology.

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:17.045
And they're enjoying that
on subways and on buses.

00:06:17.045 --> 00:06:18.670
BRENDON HARRINGTON:
More so than trying

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:21.374
to buy a car and the house
that comes along with that.

00:06:21.374 --> 00:06:22.200
STANA KATIC: Yes.

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:24.170
BRENDON HARRINGTON: How
about looking forward?

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:25.315
I mean, the future
of transportation.

00:06:25.315 --> 00:06:26.700
I mean, are you optimistic?

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:29.060
What things do you
see are opportunities?

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:31.480
Where you see a role for
companies like Google

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:34.170
to kind of really think
about future transportation?

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:36.700
STANA KATIC: You're doing
a fantastic job right now.

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:40.560
Like I said, we're
exporting a lifestyle.

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:43.900
And Google is a
part of a messaging

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:47.710
that infiltrates everything,
every part of the globe.

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:51.005
And I saw that personally
when I was in Mongolia.

00:06:51.005 --> 00:06:53.340
I'm not trying to do an
advertisement for Mongolia.

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:55.930
But what I am trying
to say is that even

00:06:55.930 --> 00:07:02.340
in the most remote or
seemingly untouched landscapes,

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:06.680
the messages that we create
here are reverberating.

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:11.340
So when we say in
some of our models,

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:14.920
hey, this is a cool
way to live, then

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:17.210
people want to emulate that.

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:18.600
And it's really
difficult to say,

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:22.970
this is a cool way to live
if our story tellers are only

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:25.070
experiencing car culture.

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:29.840
Now if, as you guys are building
programs and apps and websites

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:33.830
and new technology, if
you were saying, hey,

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:37.320
car culture, biking is a
really cool way to live.

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:40.360
You might influence
people's choices next.

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.860
And I think that that's
a part of our future.

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:45.510
Did I make sense?

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:47.010
BRENDON HARRINGTON:
And I see you're

00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:48.718
starting to talk about
a role for Google.

00:07:48.718 --> 00:07:49.710
I mean, what can we do?

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:51.460
Either the Google's
transportation team

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:52.550
or Google in general.

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:54.008
What are some
opportunities you see

00:07:54.008 --> 00:07:56.280
for us to be able to partner
with some of the messages

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:57.529
that you're getting out there.

00:07:57.529 --> 00:07:59.500
STANA KATIC: I think use it.

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:01.790
If I can convince
one of you guys--

00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:04.650
you're probably all
cyclists here anyway.

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:07.830
But if I can convince
someone who's not to try it,

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:12.220
and it affects you positively,
and you share your story

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:15.040
with other people,
it's going to translate

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:17.470
into more people doing it.

00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:21.540
So I think by Googlers using the
infrastructure that you already

00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:24.640
have, you're increasing the
demand for that infrastructure.

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:28.460
And you're going to be a
model-- a company model--

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:32.070
that we can export to
other parts of the planet.

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:34.309
And then you're also
going to build statistics.

00:08:34.309 --> 00:08:36.030
And people need statistics.

00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:38.330
And those statistics
should be free,

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:39.909
because they make
our world better.

00:08:39.909 --> 00:08:42.970
And there's no reason for us
to monetize those statistics.

00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:44.597
We can monetize other
things, because I

00:08:44.597 --> 00:08:46.930
know everyone always thinks
about how to monetize stuff.

00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:47.830
BRENDON HARRINGTON:
The behavior change

00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:50.459
is something that we're
always looking for new angles.

00:08:50.459 --> 00:08:52.500
We've been able to do
pretty well here at Google.

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:54.510
But we always think
we could do more.

00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:57.720
And so as we learn about how
to translate the behavior

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.300
change along with the
infrastructure advocacy,

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:02.114
along with the apps
and technology,

00:09:02.114 --> 00:09:03.780
it needs to be a
multi-faceted approach.

00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:08.560
STANA KATIC: But what motivates
people really, in the end?

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:09.580
OK, it's finances.

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:11.270
And a lot of
governments work just

00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:14.954
on increasing taxes
on this, and so on.

00:09:14.954 --> 00:09:16.370
But it's also a
social experience.

00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:19.910
If people believe that oh,
this is going to be fun.

00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:23.260
This will be a really wonderful
thing to be a part of,

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.580
then they'll try it for a day.

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:28.110
We have events that are
like Midnight Ridazz.

00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:31.220
And that encourages people
to just troll around

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:34.520
Los Angeles at midnight
with music blaring.

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:36.950
And it's this pack of cyclists.

00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:37.510
And it's fun.

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:39.790
And it starts introducing
people to the concept

00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:42.760
of being able to get
around town outside

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:44.020
of the bubble of their cars.

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:47.030
So you can create those
social experiences as well.

00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:48.990
And then sometimes
it just comes down

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:53.110
to graphing a friend who
might not be a cyclist,

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:55.990
or might not be a
walker, and saying,

00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:57.810
just walk with me to work.

00:09:57.810 --> 00:09:59.350
Let's just walk together.

00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:02.785
And introducing them
to how easy it is.

00:10:02.785 --> 00:10:05.000
And just introducing
them to the tap card,

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.539
introducing them to
the stops, and so on.

00:10:07.539 --> 00:10:09.330
Sometimes it's a little
bit of handholding.

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:10.371
BRENDON HARRINGTON: Yeah.

00:10:10.371 --> 00:10:11.320
Good.

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:12.619
First live question?

00:10:12.619 --> 00:10:13.160
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:14.320
Big fan of Kate Beckett.

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:15.590
STANA KATIC: Thank you.

00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:16.780
What's your name?

00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:17.405
AUDIENCE: Ravi.

00:10:17.405 --> 00:10:18.238
STANA KATIC: Ravish?

00:10:18.238 --> 00:10:19.036
AUDIENCE: Ravi.

00:10:19.036 --> 00:10:19.910
STANA KATIC: Ravi.

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:21.490
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:24.050
So you mentioned urbanization
and city planning.

00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:25.800
One of the things that
has been happening,

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:27.258
especially in
developing countries,

00:10:27.258 --> 00:10:31.580
is as cities grow frantically,
most of the planning

00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:32.700
goes into building roads.

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:35.250
And houses tend to
cluster together,

00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:36.440
places where people stay.

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:39.710
And offices are
usually far away.

00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:43.350
So cycling and
walking, they're out

00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:46.110
of the reach for those kind
of transportation modes.

00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:50.120
So what do you think can
be done for future cities

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:51.620
right at the level
of city planning,

00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:54.610
to make sure it's
really planned according

00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:59.090
to keeping the environment and
transportation of these forms

00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:00.310
in mind?

00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:03.200
STANA KATIC: Well, of course,
we got subways and bus

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:05.320
systems that will be helpful.

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:08.710
I think it's a matter of
educating the leadership

00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:11.710
in those countries.

00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:13.690
In the case of Mon--
back to Mongolia.

00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:14.940
Sorry.

00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:17.400
But in the case of Mongolia,
a lot of their leadership

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:19.260
were recently nomads.

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.980
And so the concept
of public transit

00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:26.590
and of protecting that
future for the people

00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:28.650
was kind of remote
for people who

00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:32.440
were used to traveling by
horseback for miles and miles.

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:35.460
So I think it
requires education.

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:38.650
And it's just a demand
factor, as well,

00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:39.915
by your local populace.

00:11:39.915 --> 00:11:41.540
You have to demand
that infrastructure.

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:45.990
This is the thing, too.

00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:50.280
If we're doing it
here, they're going

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:52.460
to want to do it
everywhere else.

00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:54.970
So countries that are in
development, countries that

00:11:54.970 --> 00:12:00.150
are transitioning from let's
say, communism into capitalism,

00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:02.140
we're the model, sometimes.

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:05.600
And this organization and this
company is a brilliant model.

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:08.210
Everybody wants to be this.

00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:09.300
You know?

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:10.680
So we're exporting that.

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:12.730
And I think that's a part
of the process as well.

00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:14.308
What do you think?

00:12:14.308 --> 00:12:15.224
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:18.482 --> 00:12:19.690
BRENDON HARRINGTON: Go ahead.

00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:20.570
AUDIENCE: Hi, my name is Salim.

00:12:20.570 --> 00:12:21.410
STANA KATIC: Hi.

00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:23.230
AUDIENCE: So you're
in the movie industry.

00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:25.070
But as you mentioned
earlier, cars

00:12:25.070 --> 00:12:26.560
are romanticized in the movies.

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:30.440
And yes, you're kind
of exporting culture

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:33.220
from the movies and TV
shows internationally.

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:37.040
And we don't see European movies
where they're using the subway.

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:38.950
So that's not being
exported here.

00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:41.950
Like we've got BART
where it doesn't really

00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:45.130
stop anywhere over here, right?

00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:47.970
And it's hard to retrofit.

00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:49.610
Like where are
offices in San Paolo,

00:12:49.610 --> 00:12:51.650
they just have bus service,
even though they have a subway.

00:12:51.650 --> 00:12:53.430
You know it's difficult
to put that in.

00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:55.520
So just, in movies,
are you trying

00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:57.350
to change scripts
to get them to have

00:12:57.350 --> 00:13:00.060
you use the subway in a scene?

00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:01.467
Or riding a bike?

00:13:01.467 --> 00:13:02.300
I've seen your show.

00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:05.104
But I haven't seen
you on a bicycle.

00:13:05.104 --> 00:13:05.770
STANA KATIC: No.

00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:07.600
Not yet.

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:10.630
But it is something that becomes
part of the conversation.

00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:14.750
I've joined one of
the media groups

00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:18.660
that's responsible for
environmental messaging.

00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:23.880
And so these are part of
people's thought process.

00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:28.270
Oh, one thing I
want to say, if you

00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:30.480
could get someone
like Tom Cruise

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:36.360
to ride the subway in
India, everybody, I think,

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:39.340
would want to value
that, and would make it

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:40.530
an investment, right?

00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:43.110
So if you can get
people that are

00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:46.650
in the public eye
and beloved, that's

00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:51.380
a way also of focusing
people on that resource.

00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:54.150
That being said, I
do have sometimes

00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:56.360
a limited amount of influence.

00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:58.600
And sometimes I'm
able to encourage

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:02.100
them to tell a story
that will shift us away

00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:04.220
from a car-centric culture.

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:05.390
And I try.

00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:08.160
And I think that we are
having more and more success

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:10.250
as we move forward.

00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:13.650
But the biggest difficulty
is that if the writers aren't

00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:16.560
riding subways and
aren't riding buses,

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:18.600
it's not the first thing
that comes to mind.

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:19.780
This is all secondary.

00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:21.204
Transit is really secondary.

00:14:21.204 --> 00:14:22.870
They just write it
in a car because it's

00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:24.370
subconscious in a way.

00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:26.880
We are inspired by
our surroundings.

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:29.910
We are inspired by our
relationships with people.

00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:33.050
And if we build
the infrastructure,

00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:36.380
that will affect the
change in storytelling.

00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:38.640
Now we're conscious of it here.

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:42.190
So when you guys are
building your stories

00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:44.450
that you're going to
export internationally,

00:14:44.450 --> 00:14:46.460
maybe tomorrow you
can change the story

00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:49.000
instead of being in a car,
the guy was on a bicycle

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.920
and he met her on a bicycle.

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:54.120
It could be part of
a conscious decision.

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:56.160
I feel like I kind of
like circled around and--

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:57.102
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:14:57.102 --> 00:14:59.930
STANA KATIC: Yeah.

00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:01.660
BRENDON HARRINGTON:
Other questions?

00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:02.160
Yeah.

00:15:05.049 --> 00:15:05.840
AUDIENCE: Hi Stana.

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:06.760
My name is Sakura.

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:11.720
And lately there's been a
lot of pieces and articles

00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:15.390
on NPR and elsewhere about
infrastructure, especially

00:15:15.390 --> 00:15:18.580
in the US, and how
our infrastructure

00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:20.600
does not match up
with even developing

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:22.690
worlds' infrastructure.

00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:24.270
There was a piece
on "The Daily Show"

00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:27.400
comparing ours with South
Africa's infrastructure--

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:28.420
highways, et cetera.

00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:31.010
And I was wondering,
there was also

00:15:31.010 --> 00:15:36.140
a piece on NPR about how
that part of the freeway

00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:40.800
hasn't been built. And it's been
in debate for about 50 years

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:41.425
in LA.

00:15:41.425 --> 00:15:44.980
And so I was wondering from
just like an infrastructure

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:50.800
perspective, your experiences
in Mongolia and elsewhere

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:54.230
compared to what you've
seen being developed or not

00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:56.690
happening in LA on the
infrastructure side,

00:15:56.690 --> 00:16:00.120
or just like highways or
public transportation,

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:07.040
how have you seen LA evolve,
or maybe devolve, based

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:08.630
on your experience?

00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:10.380
STANA KATIC: I found
it really interesting

00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:11.680
when I first moved to LA.

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:16.840
I found it a little
difficult. Because I

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:19.840
was living in Chicago,
I was living in Toronto,

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:21.570
I had traveled to Europe.

00:16:21.570 --> 00:16:24.290
And the concept of having
a center where everyone

00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:27.380
goes to party was normal.

00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:31.740
And the concept of getting on
a subway and heading somewhere

00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:35.085
was normal in major
cities across the rest

00:16:35.085 --> 00:16:38.980
of the US and the globe.

00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:41.770
But that didn't feel like it
was the case in Los Angeles.

00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:46.780
And because I was in a
car so much of the time

00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:48.500
when I first arrived
in Los Angeles,

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:52.910
Los Angeles felt
really unconquerable.

00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:55.530
Not in the way that oh,
you're beating something down.

00:16:55.530 --> 00:16:57.885
In the way that you feel home.

00:16:57.885 --> 00:16:59.410
You know?

00:16:59.410 --> 00:17:03.400
I didn't feel like I had
access to other people

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:04.619
that were living in the city.

00:17:04.619 --> 00:17:06.380
And I didn't feel
like I had access

00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:08.180
to the heartbeat or
the rhythm of the city,

00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:11.520
because I was stuck in
the bubble of my car.

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:13.349
And I said, oh, you know what?

00:17:13.349 --> 00:17:16.210
One day, if I have
a voice that's

00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:18.740
large enough, that can
reach enough people,

00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:20.230
I'd like to try to change it.

00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:22.599
Because I believe that
this is a media capital.

00:17:22.599 --> 00:17:25.810
And I think it'll affect
everything else out there.

00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:29.550
And LA has had horrible
experiences with smog,

00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:32.470
and has worked really
hard to shift that.

00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:35.450
And it didn't make sense to
me either, because I said,

00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:37.300
this is California.

00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:40.150
We're supposed to be
environmentally progressive.

00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:41.820
That's what everyone else says.

00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:42.660
Right?

00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:50.010
And a huge amount of the US GDP
circulates through this state,

00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:52.840
possibly still more so
than any other state.

00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:56.680
So shouldn't this feel
be like a no-brainer?

00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:58.080
Anyway.

00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:01.160
Over the years that's changed.

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:06.420
LA has started investing-- and
it likely was the whole time.

00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:10.440
I just wasn't as aware
of it as I am now,

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:13.940
because I have
actively sought it out.

00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:16.880
And because I think that
their voice-- Metro's voice,

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:21.380
LADOT's voice-- is getting
louder, because millennials

00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:25.080
don't want to sit in a car
for three hours in a day

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:27.520
to get somewhere, to get
to work and get home.

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:30.450
They want to just be able to pop
on the subway, listen to music,

00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:33.940
read a book, and like,
chat with friends, right?

00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:37.140
So I think that there is a
youth culture in Los Angeles,

00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:39.710
there is a creative force
in Los Angeles that's

00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:42.420
demanding more
out of their life,

00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:46.110
and is asking the
city to develop more.

00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:50.810
I think that people are becoming
more environmentally conscious.

00:18:50.810 --> 00:18:54.500
I think that there's a shift
in attitudes and behavior.

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:57.540
I mean, there are a
ton of electric cars

00:18:57.540 --> 00:18:59.110
that are forcing
people, in a way,

00:18:59.110 --> 00:19:01.751
or making people question
how do we get around

00:19:01.751 --> 00:19:03.250
from place to place
in a way that we

00:19:03.250 --> 00:19:05.385
haven't had to years before?

00:19:05.385 --> 00:19:06.190
I'm going on.

00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:07.270
I know.

00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:07.770
Anyway.

00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:10.940
I think there's an improvement
happening in Los Angeles.

00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:11.900
Yes.

00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:14.790
AUDIENCE: To follow that
up there, I just watched

00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:18.640
a video on YouTube about
how Heineken is sponsoring

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:23.700
some type of musical turnstiles,
which a guy had an idea about,

00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:27.060
and to build that into the
New York subway system.

00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:29.260
And so I was
wondering if you are

00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:31.150
aware of any such
things happening

00:19:31.150 --> 00:19:34.730
in LA's transportation
system to not just improve

00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:40.720
the basic infrastructure, but
to make the commute more fun.

00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:43.020
For me, that means
even though I ride

00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:47.590
my car, that means just
plugging in my music in the car

00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:50.140
so that the commute, if
I'm stuck in traffic,

00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:51.490
passes by faster.

00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:53.790
The Google shuttles are
very helpful in that we

00:19:53.790 --> 00:19:57.260
have Wi-Fi on there, and
so that we can do work.

00:19:57.260 --> 00:19:59.440
But I was wondering
for public transit,

00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:01.475
how do we make it
more fun so that we

00:20:01.475 --> 00:20:03.454
can inspire more people?

00:20:03.454 --> 00:20:04.870
STANA KATIC: I
think you're right.

00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:07.344
I think we can have events
on the subway system.

00:20:07.344 --> 00:20:08.510
We could have a party train.

00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:09.960
Why not?

00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:12.860
There could be a music system
that's playing on a train.

00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:14.030
Once in awhile.

00:20:14.030 --> 00:20:16.660
And it wouldn't distract
other commuters.

00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:19.280
I think that would be a really
great way of encouraging people

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:24.590
to come and seeing they're
transit in a different light.

00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:27.230
Also, the way that
we decorate-- it

00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:30.580
sounds kind of frou frou-- but
the way we decorate our stops

00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:32.950
can be quite inspiring.

00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:35.330
Los Angeles is doing a
great job of coordinating

00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:38.070
with local artists and
making the stops special,

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:41.190
and each of them tell
a different story.

00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:47.120
And then there is development
that is encouraging businesses

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:49.020
on each space.

00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:51.120
So bringing in
great restaurants,

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:54.290
great cafes, that you can have
a social experience at a stop

00:20:54.290 --> 00:20:56.880
is really important,
I think, for people.

00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:59.620
And it changes the face and
the way that you see travel.

00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:00.630
Travel can be fun.

00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:02.450
I've seen other companies do it.

00:21:02.450 --> 00:21:05.710
I've seen Virgin
make travel fun.

00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:09.870
I love watching that video
in all versions of it.

00:21:09.870 --> 00:21:11.930
And we can do that
to public transit.

00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:14.210
And maybe it requires
partnering up

00:21:14.210 --> 00:21:16.860
with a really great
private organization.

00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:18.110
BRENDON HARRINGTON: Thank you.

00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:19.556
We'll take another
live question.

00:21:19.556 --> 00:21:20.430
AUDIENCE: Hey, Stana.

00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:21.055
My name's Nick.

00:21:21.055 --> 00:21:22.020
STANA KATIC: Hi.

00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:23.645
AUDIENCE: So Google is
obviously willing to invest--

00:21:23.645 --> 00:21:25.145
STANA KATIC: You
look like an actor.

00:21:27.450 --> 00:21:29.590
AUDIENCE: Is that a uh--
invitation for a cameo

00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:30.150
on "Castle"?

00:21:30.150 --> 00:21:31.927
STANA KATIC: Go ahead, go ahead.

00:21:31.927 --> 00:21:34.010
AUDIENCE: So Google is
obviously willing to invest

00:21:34.010 --> 00:21:37.420
a ton of money in
moonshot ideas,

00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:40.800
like stuff that sounds crazy or
is super risky, but also really

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:41.360
ambitious.

00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:43.630
And an example is
the self-driving car.

00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:44.970
And I work next to these guys.

00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:46.470
And it's really
amazing what they're

00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:49.270
doing-- making cars safer so
more people will hopefully

00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:50.460
be willing to bike some day.

00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:53.100
But if you were
the CEO of Google,

00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:55.415
was there a kind of wild
mode of transportation

00:21:55.415 --> 00:21:59.950
you would have us invent
to help ATP's cause?

00:21:59.950 --> 00:22:02.107
STANA KATIC: You mean
other than my jet pack?

00:22:02.107 --> 00:22:02.690
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:22:02.690 --> 00:22:03.080
That's good.

00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:03.746
STANA KATIC: OK.

00:22:03.746 --> 00:22:06.040
We'll start with the jet pack.

00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:08.320
I'd like to partner with
someone on this app.

00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:11.500
I really think that
by giving governments

00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:14.220
the statistics they need, they
can change the infrastructure.

00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:17.750
And we can create safe
spaces across the globe.

00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:20.210
I'd like to see a great
bike lane along the coast

00:22:20.210 --> 00:22:23.670
from San Francisco down to LA.

00:22:23.670 --> 00:22:24.840
Those are just a couple.

00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:25.590
AUDIENCE: Awesome.

00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:26.780
Well, hopefully the
right person's listening.

00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:27.530
STANA KATIC: Yeah.

00:22:27.530 --> 00:22:28.812
Thank you.

00:22:28.812 --> 00:22:30.020
BRENDON HARRINGTON: Go ahead.

00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:30.260
AUDIENCE: Hi, Stana.

00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:31.340
My name is Mani.

00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:32.050
STANA KATIC: Hi.

00:22:32.050 --> 00:22:33.170
AUDIENCE: My question
is more around

00:22:33.170 --> 00:22:34.878
there are a lot of
initiatives here right

00:22:34.878 --> 00:22:38.730
now about making people use
bikes and things like that.

00:22:38.730 --> 00:22:40.524
But it's mostly one
day of the year,

00:22:40.524 --> 00:22:42.190
like, bike to work
and things like that.

00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:44.220
But how do you make
these people use

00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:47.750
these bikes or other means of
transportation more regularly?

00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:48.900
Because we bike one day.

00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:50.460
And then, we forget again.

00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:52.211
It's only one-day rotation.

00:22:52.211 --> 00:22:53.710
So how to make it
more like a habit,

00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:55.380
so that people do
this more often.

00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:57.171
STANA KATIC: Well, I
think you start there.

00:22:57.171 --> 00:23:00.010
You start with one day a year.

00:23:00.010 --> 00:23:05.210
Another stat-- if everyone
went car-free for just one day,

00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:08.800
we'd be saving 11 billion trees.

00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:12.860
So just starting
there is effective.

00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:15.770
We have a great organization
called CicLAvia.

00:23:15.770 --> 00:23:18.980
One of our board
member actually,

00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:20.500
is a part of CicLAvia.

00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:24.910
And they started with
just a few events.

00:23:24.910 --> 00:23:26.330
And slowly it's grown.

00:23:26.330 --> 00:23:27.990
And so let's start there.

00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:31.380
Let's just encourage people to
go biking one day in a year.

00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:33.800
And then let's do it
a couple more times.

00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:35.270
Let's set up a couple of events.

00:23:35.270 --> 00:23:37.960
Let's grab friends together
and say hey, let's just bike

00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:39.954
together.

00:23:39.954 --> 00:23:41.870
There are different
challenges you can create.

00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:43.286
But if you start
with the one day,

00:23:43.286 --> 00:23:45.840
that's a step in
the right direction.

00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:47.182
What are your thoughts?

00:23:47.182 --> 00:23:48.640
AUDIENCE: I mean,
I think it should

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:49.931
be more of a social experience.

00:23:49.931 --> 00:23:51.640
You know, that's
where enough people--

00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:53.181
other companies and
other initiatives

00:23:53.181 --> 00:23:56.420
try to include more people
habitate-- or make it a habit

00:23:56.420 --> 00:23:58.930
is maybe more of a
social experience.

00:23:58.930 --> 00:24:01.429
I kind of don't see
that a lot happening.

00:24:01.429 --> 00:24:03.720
You talk about a lot of things
like partying and things

00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:04.740
like that.

00:24:04.740 --> 00:24:07.890
But I think that it has to be
more of a social experience.

00:24:07.890 --> 00:24:09.723
STANA KATIC: So you're
thinking of making it

00:24:09.723 --> 00:24:12.290
more of a social
experience here at Google.

00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:15.200
Maybe getting a midnight
ride as sort of experience

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:16.030
here at Google.

00:24:16.030 --> 00:24:16.814
That cold be fun.

00:24:16.814 --> 00:24:17.980
AUDIENCE: Everything's open.

00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:19.176
STANA KATIC: Yeah.

00:24:19.176 --> 00:24:20.550
BRENDON HARRINGTON:
That's great.

00:24:20.550 --> 00:24:22.050
We'll be able to
take a couple more.

00:24:22.050 --> 00:24:23.757
Go ahead.

00:24:23.757 --> 00:24:24.590
AUDIENCE: Hi, Stana.

00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:25.380
I'm Russell.

00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:27.357
STANA KATIC: Hi, Russell.

00:24:27.357 --> 00:24:29.690
AUDIENCE: I don't really have
a really focused question.

00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:30.705
But one area that--

00:24:30.705 --> 00:24:31.580
STANA KATIC: It's OK.

00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:33.400
I've been unfocused
the entire time.

00:24:37.037 --> 00:24:38.620
AUDIENCE: When people
choose to drive,

00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:40.120
it's mostly because
it's convenient.

00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:43.850
And one of the most important
factors is time, right?

00:24:43.850 --> 00:24:47.505
So as cities get more crowded,
it takes longer and longer

00:24:47.505 --> 00:24:48.280
to drive.

00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:49.750
And for me, I actually bike.

00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:53.197
And I can actually bike
as fast as I can drive,

00:24:53.197 --> 00:24:54.530
with a lot more reliability too.

00:24:54.530 --> 00:24:56.230
There's no traffic
to worry about.

00:24:56.230 --> 00:24:59.700
Have you looked
into stats where you

00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:02.370
might find that walking or
driving or taking the bus

00:25:02.370 --> 00:25:04.280
is actually faster than driving?

00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:07.010
Because that's what people
care about on some level.

00:25:07.010 --> 00:25:08.770
STANA KATIC: Well, yeah.

00:25:08.770 --> 00:25:10.780
What we do is we
say, oh, how long

00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:14.380
does it take me to
get from here to work?

00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:18.070
And it's different for
everyone, of course.

00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:20.620
And sometimes it's
faster if you go by bike.

00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:22.800
Sometimes it's faster
if you go by car.

00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:26.000
But then, let's look at
the other things as well.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:27.050
I want to be fit.

00:25:27.050 --> 00:25:29.470
I want to look
handsome for my partner

00:25:29.470 --> 00:25:32.340
or for my future
spouse or whatever.

00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:34.560
So I know I'm going to be
spending an hour every day

00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:36.040
at the gym.

00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:37.400
Well, that adds extra time.

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:39.300
But you can kill two
birds with one stone

00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:41.730
if you just ride your
bike to work, right?

00:25:41.730 --> 00:25:44.860
So I think that there
is a lot of stuff

00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:47.629
to take in consideration in
order to motivate a person.

00:25:47.629 --> 00:25:49.170
And I think that's
what you're asking

00:25:49.170 --> 00:25:52.640
is, how do we motivate
people to take

00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:55.310
an alternative mode of transit.

00:25:55.310 --> 00:26:00.410
And if it comes down
to time and just time,

00:26:00.410 --> 00:26:01.420
then things like that.

00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:03.894
You can collaborate efforts.

00:26:03.894 --> 00:26:04.810
You can say, hey, man.

00:26:04.810 --> 00:26:06.520
You don't have to work
out today because you just

00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:07.650
rode your bike to work.

00:26:07.650 --> 00:26:08.494
You know?

00:26:08.494 --> 00:26:10.619
AUDIENCE: And you don't
have to spend time parking.

00:26:10.619 --> 00:26:11.884
I mean, people ignore--

00:26:11.884 --> 00:26:13.550
STANA KATIC: That's
extra time, as well.

00:26:13.550 --> 00:26:17.010
I'm sure that there's a billion
ideas about how this would

00:26:17.010 --> 00:26:20.050
save people time in the end.

00:26:20.050 --> 00:26:23.640
I know I have friends
in Los Angeles who

00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:26.900
have made the choice
to cycle only to work.

00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:29.180
And they found
that after a while,

00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:31.250
they were able to get
to work in 45 minutes.

00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:32.750
For instance, I
have a colleague who

00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:34.830
gets to work on his
bike in 45 minutes.

00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:36.365
And he's timed it out regularly.

00:26:36.365 --> 00:26:40.740
And he said, it takes me an
hour and four minutes to drive.

00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:41.390
So you know.

00:26:41.390 --> 00:26:44.430
You've got to also
test it out sometimes.

00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:45.097
Thanks, Russell.

00:26:45.097 --> 00:26:46.929
BRENDON HARRINGTON:
We'll take the last two,

00:26:46.929 --> 00:26:47.956
and then we'll wrap up.

00:26:47.956 --> 00:26:49.330
AUDIENCE: Thanks
for stopping by.

00:26:49.330 --> 00:26:52.680
I had a question about NIMBYism,
both in like the community

00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:54.630
level and just like in
the sense of planning.

00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:57.490
Like to get to the LA
airport, you can theoretically

00:26:57.490 --> 00:26:59.410
take the new subway
line they're building up

00:26:59.410 --> 00:27:00.760
until a certain point.

00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:04.020
SFO, you have to change
trains several times.

00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:06.720
Communities are just like voting
out of public transportation.

00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:09.430
Like even the BART
expansion in the Bay Area.

00:27:09.430 --> 00:27:11.780
Like, what can we
do to get everyone

00:27:11.780 --> 00:27:13.700
on board for the
greater good, instead

00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:17.764
of these little fiefdoms that
just vote themselves out?

00:27:17.764 --> 00:27:19.430
STANA KATIC: You have
to talk to people.

00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:20.820
You have to engage with them.

00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:22.330
You have to bring
real statistics.

00:27:22.330 --> 00:27:27.870
I sit down with
people all the time

00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:31.190
who don't have the
complete picture about how

00:27:31.190 --> 00:27:34.190
it could benefit them.

00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:37.590
So it's a matter of educating
people and being patient

00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:44.475
and continuing to advocate in
spite of those steps backward.

00:27:44.475 --> 00:27:45.110
I don't know.

00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:45.860
What do you think?

00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:48.017
You've got experience, it seems.

00:27:48.017 --> 00:27:48.600
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:51.510
Regional planning is probably
the best way to go about it.

00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:54.790
Like, some sort of a regional
Transportation Authority

00:27:54.790 --> 00:27:58.589
with real power to zone
and implement I guess.

00:27:58.589 --> 00:27:59.630
At least in the Bay Area.

00:27:59.630 --> 00:28:00.754
That's my opinion.

00:28:00.754 --> 00:28:02.170
BRENDON HARRINGTON:
So to wrap up,

00:28:02.170 --> 00:28:03.150
thank you so much for your time.

00:28:03.150 --> 00:28:04.770
Thank you for sharing
your thoughts.

00:28:04.770 --> 00:28:05.800
There's lots of themes here.

00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:07.290
There's the infrastructure
improvements.

00:28:07.290 --> 00:28:08.350
There's behavior change.

00:28:08.350 --> 00:28:09.070
There's advocacy.

00:28:09.070 --> 00:28:10.980
And then there's this
use of technology.

00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:13.410
And then most importantly,
is the communications and use

00:28:13.410 --> 00:28:14.110
of the media.

00:28:14.110 --> 00:28:15.100
So thanks for sharing all that.

00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:16.560
We hope we can continue
to work together.

00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:16.940
STANA KATIC: Thank you.

00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:17.670
BRENDON HARRINGTON:
And thank you all.

00:28:17.670 --> 00:28:20.410
Please join me in thanking
Stana for her time.

00:28:20.410 --> 00:28:21.910
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:21.910 --> 00:28:24.660
