00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.700
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:26.830
[ Applause ]

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:28.690
&gt;&gt; David S. Mao: My name is David
Mao and I have the privilege

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:31.950
and honor of serving as the
Acting Librarian of Congress.

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.250
Welcome to the closing lecture
of the Poet Laureate Consultant

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.040
in Poetry at the Library
of Congress.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.060
[ Cheering and Applause ]

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:48.180
In June of last year, the
13th Librarian of Congress,

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.670
James H. Billington,
appointed Juan Felipe Herrera

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.760
as the 21st Poet Laureate.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.960
We are very grateful that Dr.
Billington, now the Librarian

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.250
of Congress Emeritus,
and Mrs. Billington,

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.050
are here with us this evening.

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:10.720
[ Applause and Cheering ]

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.200
During Dr. Billington's
tenure as Librarian

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.310
of Congress he appointed
19 Poets Laureate, so, yes,

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.540 position:56%
please join me again in thanking him
for his [applause] steadfast support

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.510
of not only this program here
at the Library of Congress --

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.650
[ Applause ]

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.300
-- but also his steadfast
support for this art form.

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.920
At the start of Mr. Herrera's term,
he launched La Casa de Colores,

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.350
and I apologize, I
don't speak Spanish.

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.300
It's an online project that
allows everyone the opportunity

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:50.560
to contribute to his epic
crowdsourced poem, "La Familia."

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.820 position:56%
Critics have said "La Familia"
spans languages, topics, structures,

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.300
tones, and is a stream of
consciousness that echoes the vast

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.370
yet connected fears and
joys of people in America.

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.460
And I want to encourage all
of you to participate in this.

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.970
You can still participate.

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.870
Come to our website, loc.gov, and
just simply search for Poetry,

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:14.630
and then you, too, can be
a part of this epic poem.

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.040
Now such an ambitious project
is really rare for laureates

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.920
as they usually take, mm,
about six months just to figure

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.210
out what they want to
do in the position.

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.080
But I think it surely came as
no surprise to those of you

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.920
that are familiar with
Mr. Herrera's tenure

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.390 position:56%
as California's State Poet Laureate.

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.680
But this is really only half of Mr.
Herrera's power in the position.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.030
The other half comes from
his own award-winning work.

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.490
And now, as Dr. Billington said
last year, "Mr. Herrera's poems,"

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:47.740
and I quote, "engage in a
serious sense of play in language

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.960
and in image that gives
them enduring power.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.530
I see how they champion voices,
traditions, and histories,

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.100
as well as a cultural
perspective which is a vital part

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.970
of our larger American identity."

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.980
Following the announcement
of Mr. Herrera's selection,

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.720
a noted critic wrote in the
<i>Los Angeles Review of Books </i>,

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.080
"As a poet who makes
impassioned connections

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.610
from his Chicano subjectivity to
his role as Citizen of the Americas

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.630
to his participation
as a global citizen,

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.740
Herrera has written an exceptional
body of work, a true testament

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:24.170
to his unwavering convictions and
respect for the power of language.

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.580
He's a consummate artist
and activist

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.590
who will bring a different energy
and perspective to his duties

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.430
as Poet Laureate of
the United States."

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.510
And truly he has done
that over the last year.

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:42.920
[ Applause ]

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.260
All of this energy was evident
in Mr. Herrera's opening reading

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.640
at the Library last September.

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.350
And I think maybe many of
you were here for that.

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:53.460
That was an event that the
<i>Washington Post </i>said, and I quote,

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:56.580
"was infused with humility
and graciousness."

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.530
Well, I think tonight's event
titled "Pioneers of Flowers

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.310
and Song" will undoubtedly
extend that spirit

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.410
as our Laureate celebrates poets
important to his own development

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:09.920
and invites to very, very
special guests to join him

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.220
and celebrate the future.

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.910
And I think you're going to be
really surprised and pleased

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.500
with what he has in store
for us this evening.

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.330
This even is presented in
partnership with Split This Rock

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:22.510
and serves as the opening event
for the Split This Rock Festival.

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:30.150
[ Applause and Cheering ]

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.670
So a special thanks to
Split This Rock Co-Founder

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:34.470
and Executive Director,
Sarah Browning,

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.510
for her help in promoting
Juan Felipe Herrera --

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:40.040
[ Applause and Cheering ]

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.340
-- Herrera's laureateship.

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.250
And I might add, thank
you for also providing

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.010
for sign language interpretation.

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:48.510
It's very important for
this program this evening.

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:53.090
[ Applause ]

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:54.600
Now I want to also
take this opportunity

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.160
to make a very important
announcement.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.070
This may be Herrera's
final event of his term,

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.510
but it's not his last
as Poet Laureate.

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:08.040
[ Cheering and Applause ]

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.080
As Acting Librarian of
Congress, I'm very pleased to say

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.070
that I've renewed Juan
Felipe Herrera

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:17.510 position:56%
as the 21st Poet Laureate Consultant
in Poetry for a second term.

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:28.040
[ Cheering and Applause ]

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.110
And if you've been amazed with
all the work that he's done just

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:32.890
in this first term, I can only
imagine what he will accomplish

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:34.190
in the second year.

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:36.490
So stay tuned for things to come.

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:39.510
Please join me in welcoming
him to our stage.

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:45.270
[ Applause and Cheering ]

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:46.570
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: Thank you.

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:48.310
Thank you, David.

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:49.610
Thank you so much.

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:50.910
Thank you.

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:52.210
It's a great please.

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:53.510
Muchas gracias.

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:54.810
Thank you, everybody.

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:56.110
Thank you, David.

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:57.410
Thanks, everyone.

00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:58.710
What a great joy.

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:00.010
What a great joy this is.

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:01.310
And I want to thank Dr. James
Billington who gave me a call

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:03.340
from the very beginning,
and our great staff --

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:07.560
Rob Casper and Anya
Creightney and Matt Blakely,

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.380
and the entire Library of Congress.

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:13.790
How beautiful it is to be
here, how beautiful the Library

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:18.180
of Congress is, how fabulous
are the materials and archives

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:21.230
and manuscripts and the
paintings and the prints

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:25.340
and Cervantes' first book
which is around this big.

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:29.580
However, you can make it
this big once you read it,

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:32.790
and much bigger than
the world perhaps.

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:38.790
I've met so many good people --
the division chiefs, the librarians

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:44.360
at large, and coming through the
front door, and coming up here,

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.910
and the beautiful receptions that
we have, and friends that appear

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:52.260
out of nowhere that I love
that have come to be with us,

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:55.580
and the great partnerships,
the great partnerships.

00:06:55.580 --> 00:07:00.360
It really is about being a
community and about being a family,

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:03.220
a family with the voices
in the Library,

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:05.250
a family with the librarians,

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:09.130
a family with the beautiful
staff that put me together.

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:11.230
They go, "Okay, Juan
Felipe, where's your head.

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:13.650
Put it on.

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:15.760
And you got it together and
your feet, where are they?

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:17.060
Let's bring over the feet.

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:18.360
Okay. Put them back together.

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:19.690
Okay. Stand him upright.

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:20.990
Okay, okay.

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:22.290
Now push him out.

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:24.610
Push him out [laughter]."

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:26.490
And so that's what
they've been doing today.

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:32.300
I really appreciate it, and to be
here in Washington, D.C., you know,

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:37.640
representing everyone at the
Library of Congress and going

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:43.810 position:56%
to so many places across the nation,
and meeting children and familias,

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:49.200
families that bring their children
to see me at the presentations,

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:54.270 position:56%
and they say to their children, they
say, "This is Juan Felipe Herrera.

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:56.490
He's a Poet Laureate
of the United States.

00:07:56.490 --> 00:07:58.150
I want you to say hi, okay?"

00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:04.140
And then we say hi and hi, and
just that is -- that just --

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:05.870
that's is what we're
all about, right?

00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:07.320
That's what we're all about.

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:12.190
We say hi and then we can read
and then we can talk about books.

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:16.160
But first we have to say hello and
meet each other and be together.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:19.950
And then I meet the students
that have just graduated

00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:21.530
and they're becoming teachers.

00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:25.100
This was in Nevada,
Nevada State College.

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:27.140
I'm going to be a teacher.

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:29.030
I just got my certificate.

00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:31.020
I go, great, fabulous.

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:32.320
And I'm so excited.

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:34.810
I go, excellent, that's
what it's all about.

00:08:34.810 --> 00:08:36.700
So we do that, too.

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:41.720
And then writers that come and see
me at the event after the reading

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:44.090
and they go, oh, I
just -- I'm a poet.

00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:45.770
I go, great.

00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:47.480
And I have some poems.

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:49.490
I go, fabulous.

00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:51.730
And can I show them to you?

00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:53.530
Okay.

00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:57.610
[ Laughter ]

00:08:57.610 --> 00:08:59.360
And I really say okay.

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:00.660
I really do.

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:02.210
And we have a little mini workshop,

00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:05.350
we have a little mini workshop
right there in-between everything,

00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:06.860
there's a mini workshop.

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:08.560
And that's beautiful.

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:09.860
That's beautiful.

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:12.500
We also do little mini workshops

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:17.030
as we move along throughout
the nation and meeting people.

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:20.200
And children that raise their
hands and have a question for you.

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:21.710
And I go, by all means.

00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:25.190
And then they have big questions,
they have giant questions

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:26.770
that fill up the whole space.

00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:30.850
And I bring them up to the
stage and I go, can you repeat

00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:34.620
that for the entire
audience of 700 people?

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:38.120
Okay? And then they
present their question.

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:43.550 position:56%
And then the rest of the people that
come from the city and from beyond,

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:47.550
they listen to a new voice asking
big questions about literature

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:49.640
and how they want to write.

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:51.910
And this continues.

00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:55.500
And I met, I did meet
two amazing writers,

00:09:55.500 --> 00:10:02.550 position:56%
11-year-old Sarita Sol Gonzalez, who
we're going to present at the end

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:08.040
of the program, and I did meet
Elena Medina also, 12-years-old.

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:10.630
They're going to present
at the end of the program,

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:12.210
and they're our Laureate
Chicas [laughter].

which are the Aztec Nahuatl terms

for poetry which translate
into flower and song.

00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:47.080 position:56%
So we were in Aztec times, and
still we have many Nahuatl speakers.

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:48.380
We would say [foreign words].

00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:53.100
And they would say oh,
yeah, poetry, poetry.

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:57.170
And our pioneers were
very interested in poetry.

Something happened.

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:10.240
And we began to think about
our ancestors, and my friends

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:16.410
and my cadre and those that I
grew up with as a poet in cafes

00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:20.000
and rallies and in the
streets of San Francisco

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.070

00:12:22.070 --> 00:12:24.690
And we kind of -- poetry
was like clay.

00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:26.400
We found it and we grabbed it.

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:29.200
It was reddish, it was hot,
and we wanted to shape it,

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:31.760
and to do that many a time.

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:34.110
We had to go back to
the books and find some

00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:37.870
of our roots and explore them.

00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:42.220
And from there gain life and
present them to the world.

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:43.520
It was a big effort.

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:48.000
It was a very ambitious effort.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.160

about it like that.

of them have passed
away at a young age.

00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:30.680
of months ago in February.

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:38.570

task of learning Nahuatl,

the language of the
Mashika, of the Aztecs.

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:47.080
And he writes this poem called "In

Thank you so much for Francisco
and his legacy who worked so hard,

00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:53.040
was a great teacher, great
writer for children, great poet,

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:56.720
never thought about
being acknowledged.

00:14:56.720 --> 00:15:01.310
And it's an amazing, pioneering,
groundbreaking projects

00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:06.120
that we still need to follow up
on, in particular the translation

00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:12.280
of Aztec materials and his
spreading the word of that beauty

00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:13.730
and that type of material,

00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:18.420
and reinterpreting those
materials in his own way as well.

00:15:21.070 --> 00:15:26.770
And perhaps that dreaming up
the cosmos required going back

to the glyphs and ancient walls
buried somewhere in Central America,

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:39.980
maybe in El Peten, Guatemala.

In this case, dug up by Heather
Hurst that I met on the road

00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:52.180 position:56%
who painted these glyphs and went
to Guatemala and crawled into a cave

00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:55.470
that was dark and abandoned
and busted.

She touched those walls
and she scratched

00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:00.880

And what did she find?

00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:10.450
She found these murals that told
stories way earlier than the ones

00:16:10.450 --> 00:16:14.600
that we had known about
in Bonampak in Chiapas.

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:19.320 position:56%
I visited those murals back in 1970,

back in time.

and bursting rays of corn.

That's what my friends looked at.

00:16:38.890 --> 00:16:43.110
That's what these early poets were
interested in in the late '60s,

early '70s, through the '80s.

And with Francisco, all the way
through the '90s to the present.

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:59.190
But it wasn't easy because we had
this thing called the conquest.

00:16:59.190 --> 00:17:02.350
We had to deal with that.

00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:08.190
And it was a complex project.

Are we European, are we
Spanish, are we Indian,

00:17:11.110 --> 00:17:12.820
are we Mexican, are we American?

00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:16.780
And that's been an ongoing debate.

00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:18.080
And not only a debate

00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:25.530
but a soul-searching
voyage, a beautiful one also.

00:17:25.530 --> 00:17:30.100
And perhaps this is -- this is one
of the texts that was very moving

00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:33.830
when we began this
project in the late '60s.

Millions of the peoples had died,

with the Spanish, the
tragic invasion.

00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:58.850
And this was recorded by Miguel

to receive the -- kind of like a
lifetime award, a living legend.

And that [foreign words], the
elder Aztecs are already --

00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:13.690
have lost everything.

00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:17.450
They represent the Mashika,
the Aztec Nation destroyed.

00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:21.570
And they're standing
before the friars

00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:25.830
who represent the new
way, the new knowledge.

00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:30.740
And they say, "And
now what can we say?

toward your ears?

of our lord of the near and far.

For him we risk everything.

This is why we're in danger.

00:18:56.060 --> 00:19:01.350
Perhaps to our perdition,
perhaps to our destruction,

00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:05.240
is where we will be taken.

00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:08.370
But where should we go?

00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:10.730
We are finite.

00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:12.850
We are mortals.

00:19:12.850 --> 00:19:14.480
Let us die in peace.

00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:15.780
Let us vanish.

00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:18.350
All of our deities have died.

Let your hearts and flesh
be calmed here, sirs.

We will break a little, bit by bit.

We'll open the secret,
the ark of our lord."

00:19:30.490 --> 00:19:39.790
So spoke the Aztec, noble, nobles,
teachers that were now captured.

00:19:39.790 --> 00:19:44.690
"You say that we don't know about
the lord of that which is near

You said that our goals were
not real, a new word this is

for us, that which you speak.

00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:00.430
Because of it we're disturbed.

00:20:00.430 --> 00:20:05.140
Because of it we are burdened,
because our ancestors,

00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:09.150
those who have lived on this
earth never spoke this way.

00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:11.380
They taught us their way of life.

00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:14.720
They rendered real
tribute to their gods.

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:18.180
They taught us all of their
traditions and the way

00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:24.490
in which they would honor their
gods like this before them.

We bring the earth to our
mouth, we bring the earth.

For them we bleed.

00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:33.910
We made good on our promise,
burned the [foreign word],

00:20:33.910 --> 00:20:37.270
and brought our offerings
for sacrifice.

00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:39.150
This was a long time ago.

00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:40.450
It was their [foreign word]

and [foreign word] in

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:48.650
-- until now.

of life, those of the Chichimekas

the ancient peoples, the Tepanecas?

00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:10.410
We know to whom we owe our
life, to whom we owe our birth.

00:21:10.410 --> 00:21:17.070
This is what we respond, what we
reply to your breath, to your word.

00:21:20.250 --> 00:21:23.510
So that translation by Miguel --

00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:30.810
[ Applause ]

00:21:30.810 --> 00:21:37.190
-- that translation by Miguel
Leon-Portilla, the great scholar

00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:43.170
of Nahuatl thought and culture,
with his great book, <i>Aztec Thought</i>

00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:47.970
<i>and Culture </i>, that came out in the
'60s, which was a right time for us

00:21:47.970 --> 00:21:53.760
as young poets and searchers and
seekers of our writing and culture

00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:57.150
and identity at that
time, the Civil Rights,

00:21:57.150 --> 00:22:02.280
that new democracy,
was perfect, that book.

00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:08.800
And that poem that I just read by
the [foreign word], the elders,

00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:12.920
the speakers, the keepers of the
word that spoke to in response

00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:18.050
to the friars was a page in a poem

00:22:18.050 --> 00:22:21.650
that we literally memorized
and thought about.

00:22:21.650 --> 00:22:28.390
So this is the way it was with
this generation that I'm speaking

00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:30.190
of that we're paying
tribute to tonight.

00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:32.350
And we shall see them.

00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:35.310
And there's also the --
here we have in the Library,

00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:39.450
we have the codex,
the Huexotzinco Codex.

00:22:39.450 --> 00:22:47.910
And it's a little later, it's a few
years beyond 19 -- after 1915 24.

00:22:47.910 --> 00:22:52.040
And it shows the, kind of a
tribute, codex of tribute,

00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:57.790
of what has to be paid in
what amounts to the ruler.

00:22:57.790 --> 00:23:00.530
In this case it's a colonist.

00:23:00.530 --> 00:23:01.970
Things have changed.

00:23:01.970 --> 00:23:04.000
And they respond, they
want to respond,

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.220
and they want to say
you're being unfair.

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:09.840
We have paid quite a bit.

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:13.400
We have worked hard, and
we don't think it's right,

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:16.050
and we're going to sue you.

00:23:16.050 --> 00:23:22.790
The suit, suing people,
was possible now.

00:23:22.790 --> 00:23:28.360
So the suit went forward.

00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:33.250
I'm speaking about the social
response, how we all can respond,

00:23:33.250 --> 00:23:35.130
and how we all have responded.

00:23:35.130 --> 00:23:38.260
And I think the work that we have
here in the Library are responses

00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:40.370
to reality, responses
to our visions,

00:23:40.370 --> 00:23:43.970
responses to our creativity
in our hearts.

00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:54.690
I'm going to move on to kind
of a more personal story,

00:23:54.690 --> 00:24:05.520
the story of my father who comes
much later to the United States.

00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:10.770
And he arrives in the late 1800s.

00:24:10.770 --> 00:24:12.900
My father was born in 1882.

00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:19.870
And this is him standing
up in Denver, Colorado.

00:24:19.870 --> 00:24:24.080
He used to say, "Juanito,
it was so cold [laughter]."

00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:30.880 position:56%
I was 14. "I had jumped a train from
Chihuahua, from a little ranchito.

00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:34.900
And when I got to Denver" --
remember, I was only 14 --

00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:39.820
"and when I got to Denver
I jumped off the train.

00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:46.080
It was so cold [laughter] that I
spit [spitting sound] and it turned

00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:48.510
to little cubes of ice, Juanito."

00:24:48.510 --> 00:24:52.500
[ Laughter ]

00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:55.740
And my mother used
photographs to tell me stories.

00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:59.750
This is one of the photographs
that she used in her album,

00:24:59.750 --> 00:25:02.680
one of those Kress
or Woolworths albums.

00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:04.980
That was the '50s.

00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:10.360 position:56%
And she'd show me the photograph
and she'd say, "This is your father,

00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:13.860
Juan, and he's in Denver.

00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:15.650
And this is 1904.

00:25:15.650 --> 00:25:18.640
And this is his friend,
Jose Barrera.

00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:22.730
And you see how he writes on
the sides of the photograph?"

00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:24.370
"Yes, mama."

00:25:24.370 --> 00:25:29.620
"And he writes, and you know he
learned how to speak English.

00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:31.170
Guess how he learned."

00:25:31.170 --> 00:25:33.780
How, mama?"

00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:39.450
"He learned English by buying
a word for a penny, each word,

00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:42.360
in English, for a penny."

00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:46.830
A penny? A penny?"

00:25:46.830 --> 00:25:48.960
"Si, Juanito."

00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:53.360
So that's how my father learned how
to speak English, by buying words

00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:57.150
for a penny when he worked very
hard as a cowboy, as a ranch hand,

00:25:57.150 --> 00:26:01.740
in Wyoming and up north in Denver,
Colorado, also, and his friend.

00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:07.410
And he liked to write and he liked
to read and he worked very hard

00:26:07.410 --> 00:26:10.020
and he invented everything.

00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:13.320
It was -- shoes fell apart,
he picked up pieces of leather

00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:18.370
and hammered new leather on that
shoe and he could walk really cool.

00:26:18.370 --> 00:26:21.340
And if we didn't have a house, he
found some wood and built it on top

00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:27.150
of a beat-up old car, and my mother
would say, "What are you doing?"

00:26:27.150 --> 00:26:28.690
He said, "See that
thing right there?"

00:26:28.690 --> 00:26:30.530
"What?" "That beat-up old car."

00:26:30.530 --> 00:26:31.920
"Yeah. Why?"

00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:34.340
"I'm going to build a house."

00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:35.640
"On that?"

00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:37.730
"Yes." "Why?"

00:26:37.730 --> 00:26:41.980
"Because we're going
to travel [laughter]."

00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:46.630
"Where?" "We're going
to go to Ramona."

00:26:46.630 --> 00:26:50.470
"Why?" "Because they have the
best water in the whole world."

00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:52.770
"Like Don Quixote [laughter]?"

00:26:53.910 --> 00:26:56.250
That was my father.

00:26:56.250 --> 00:27:00.960
My mother came to Juarez
after the Mexican Revolution.

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:04.610
And it was a small
town and who knows?

00:27:04.610 --> 00:27:07.250
You know, she came from the
poorest barrio in Mexico,

00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:11.240
at Tepito, in -- around 1918.

00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:14.330
And the Revolution had
rumbled everything up,

00:27:14.330 --> 00:27:17.800
changed everything up, energized
everybody, everybody wanted to move

00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:19.980
and go places, things
were falling apart,

00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:21.890
and things were being recreated

00:27:21.890 --> 00:27:26.500
like a living poem
earthquake had hit Mexico.

00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:30.650
So she came up north with my
grandmother, Juanita, and my aunt,

00:27:30.650 --> 00:27:38.400
Aurelia, to Juarez, to follow
the dream and follow my uncles,

Vicente [foreign words] and [foreign

00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:50.530
Texas, El Paso, Texas, to la
frontera, to the new experience

00:27:50.530 --> 00:27:54.440
of the new life right after
Poncho Villa had passed

00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:56.030
through there, actually.

00:27:56.030 --> 00:28:00.570
And that was a good
example, you know.

00:28:00.570 --> 00:28:04.300
Just get going and hop on a horse.

00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:08.220
In this case, my mother and
grandmother hopped on a train.

00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:11.800
Anthony Quinn had already
been there, by the way.

00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:16.700
Anthony Quinn left Mexico
City with his mom around 1912

00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:20.180
and hit Juarez also,
which is interesting.

00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:22.510
Poncho Villa, Anthony
Quinn, and my mom.

00:28:22.510 --> 00:28:26.170

00:28:26.170 --> 00:28:28.700
So I feel kind of good
about that, you know?

00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:30.120
I feel really good.

00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:31.910
It's a really interesting mix.

00:28:31.910 --> 00:28:33.860
It's a really good blend.

00:28:33.860 --> 00:28:36.750
And my mother, you know,
was spunky, you know.

00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:40.830
My mother was spunky and
she wanted to be a dancer.

00:28:40.830 --> 00:28:44.730
She always did rhymes and poetry
while we were having dinner

00:28:44.730 --> 00:28:46.030
or tortillas.

00:28:46.030 --> 00:28:48.510
And in the middle of
everything she would say --

00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:54.860
It was at 5:00 in the afternoon.

00:28:54.860 --> 00:28:57.580
She would quote some, you
know, really deep poem.

00:28:57.580 --> 00:29:00.510
It was 5:00 in the afternoon.

00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:06.380

Can you pass that tortilla, Juanito?

00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:10.640
[ Laughter ]

00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:12.330
She was very dramatic.

00:29:12.330 --> 00:29:14.850
My mom was totally dramatic.

00:29:14.850 --> 00:29:17.160
Everything was like drama.

00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:20.010
Nothing was, you know,
even, even like that.

00:29:20.010 --> 00:29:21.310
It was dramatic.

00:29:21.310 --> 00:29:23.760
And she wanted to be a
dancer and singer and --

00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:27.480
but, you know, the rules
that were very strict.

00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:32.360
So she was kind of kept back from
following her dream as a actress

00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:34.870
and as a singer and a dancer.

00:29:34.870 --> 00:29:36.530
And, of course, those
theaters were speak theaters

00:29:36.530 --> 00:29:42.470
and burlesque theaters and my
grandmother had a cobalt iron hand

00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:46.520
and kept her back, but
didn't keep her dream back.

00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:49.410
And she gave me her dream.

00:29:49.410 --> 00:29:54.320
And that's how I started at home.

00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:59.740
And that dream was also picked up
by the women of Juarez, very young,

00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:04.110
16-year-old that I have
spoken to, who are in their --

00:30:04.110 --> 00:30:08.530
one of them is still living --
she's around 99 and Cuka Aguirre

00:30:08.530 --> 00:30:12.260
and with her sister Cuka --

00:30:12.260 --> 00:30:17.720
Ava Aguirre and their
cousin, Elvira Macias.

00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:21.450
And they formed a group
called [foreign words].

00:30:21.450 --> 00:30:25.970
And it was great to
meet them in El Paso.

00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:29.540
I went to El Paso.

00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:33.450
We found each other in the Web
because I had spoken about --

00:30:33.450 --> 00:30:36.090
at the radio theater of the 30's

00:30:36.090 --> 00:30:39.670
that my uncle belonged
to [foreign words] XCJ.

00:30:39.670 --> 00:30:46.580
And all this, you know, pours into

how they tore away and broke away

and joined the radio shows like
Cuka, like Ave, like Elvira,

00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:04.260
and became great singers and
became great songwriters,

00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:06.120
and became great dancers,

Texas with chaperones.

00:31:09.510 --> 00:31:12.210
[ Laughter ]

00:31:12.210 --> 00:31:15.730
So this is Cuka and Ava
and Elvira as teenagers.

00:31:15.730 --> 00:31:19.700
And they were famous all
over El Paso, all over Texas,

00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:25.880
and their only album was locked
up in a vault and never released.

00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:28.350
So that's why I want
you to meet them,

in her late 90s.

She's in her late --
she's always having jokes,

"Yes, yes, dear Cuka."

"Yes, Aunt Cuka.

How are you doing?"

00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:19.510
And then we have a conversation.

00:32:19.510 --> 00:32:22.010
And my uncle was part
of the same group.

00:32:22.010 --> 00:32:26.810
And in those days poets
and singers could publish

00:32:26.810 --> 00:32:30.690
in a small little insert in a
newspaper of [foreign words],

00:32:30.690 --> 00:32:36.890
<i>The Continental Newspaper of
Juarez </i>, which we talked about,

00:32:36.890 --> 00:32:40.300
where Poncho Villa crossed through
and Anthony Quinn and my mother

00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:43.020

00:32:55.390 --> 00:32:59.150

I found this piece of paper

in Cuka's archives which
burnt down a few weeks ago.

Her house burnt down to a crisp,
and all her archives and photos

went up in smoke.

celebrating her again tonight.

of my uncle's poem,

find from the '30s of Mexicanos

that we have available of that era

in this group of artists.

00:33:41.460 --> 00:33:48.890
And he used this voice of
a working-class worker,

a working-class kind of a person
that was moved and pushed around

voice of the man from the pueblo,

00:35:12.180 --> 00:35:15.510
On Sundays he would give
me a little bit of corn.

00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:21.090
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:35:21.090 --> 00:35:25.510
And other times he gave me
my, my little bit of money.

00:35:25.510 --> 00:35:29.460
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:32.260
He would invite me
to eat in his house,

00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:38.510
his house [laughter], his house.

00:35:38.510 --> 00:35:44.510
[ Laughter ]

00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:48.050
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:35:48.050 --> 00:35:51.510
And then he would tell
me to go to the kitchen.

00:35:51.510 --> 00:36:00.040
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:06.150
Well they were going to give me
big deep bowls and a lot to eat."

00:36:06.150 --> 00:36:09.600
And then the poem continues.

00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:18.390
And it gets, it gets deeper and it
gets very heartfelt as it moves on.

00:36:18.390 --> 00:36:21.820
And that's the poem -- and
those are some of the voices

00:36:21.820 --> 00:36:31.640
of our early poets in the '30s on
the borderland of Juarez, El Paso,

00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:35.930
that we have today right
here for the first time.

00:36:35.930 --> 00:36:37.230
No one has seen this.

00:36:37.230 --> 00:36:38.530
No one has heard this.

00:36:38.530 --> 00:36:42.640
And I'm so happy that you
can hear it and see it,

00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:44.660
at least for a little while.

00:36:44.660 --> 00:36:47.210
"Pioneers of Flower and
Song [foreign words]",

00:36:47.210 --> 00:36:51.220
poetry in its many forms.

00:36:51.220 --> 00:36:54.930
And perhaps in a way that
we have not been exposed to.

00:36:54.930 --> 00:36:56.230
And that's what we do.

00:36:56.230 --> 00:37:00.720
That's what we do here at
the Library of Congress.

00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:02.820
But this kept on, you know,
this further revolution,

00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:05.370
the spirit of the working
class, the spirit of bringing

00:37:05.370 --> 00:37:08.130
out what's taking place in Mexico.

00:37:08.130 --> 00:37:11.210
It was taken up by the great
painters, that later were taken

00:37:11.210 --> 00:37:14.870
up by the poets, the ones
we're going to talk about.

00:37:14.870 --> 00:37:23.480
So here are some images of those
early '30s exuberant responses

00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:31.130
and feverish responses and
full all-out painted responses,

00:37:31.130 --> 00:37:34.190
in big walls, not little
walls, big walls,

00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:43.780 position:56%
by the great muralists Jose Clemente
Orozco, Diego Rivera, as you know,

00:37:43.780 --> 00:37:48.030
and David Alfaro Sequeiros.

00:37:48.030 --> 00:37:57.090
And these particular murals were
very inspiring decades later.

00:37:57.090 --> 00:38:01.120 position:56%
That great new democracy of the '60s

00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:04.430
that we all wanted to
be part of, you know?

00:38:04.430 --> 00:38:10.410
Inspired by many -- Martin
Luther King, Dolores Huerta,

00:38:10.410 --> 00:38:15.660
the gay movement, the workers'
movement, the student movement,

00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:22.430
and just the desire to
bring equality for all.

00:38:22.430 --> 00:38:27.510 position:56%
And the next piece, you know, we
have one of our poets, Jose Montoya,

00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:32.340
that passed away also last year.

00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:37.350 position:56%
And you see him with his interesting
outfit because he belonged

00:38:37.350 --> 00:38:39.510
and founded the Royal
Chicano Air Force --

00:38:39.510 --> 00:38:44.230
[ Laughter ]

00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:47.860
-- which was a mural
squad, a mural squadron

00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:51.820
that went throughout the
Southwest painting murals.

00:38:51.820 --> 00:38:54.960
So that's the Royal
Chicano Air Force.

00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:57.520
And he, you know, you have to
-- if you're in the Air Force,

00:38:57.520 --> 00:39:00.190
you got to dress like
you're in the Air Force.

00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:04.670
And behind him you see the
Farm Workers' flag, the eagle,

00:39:04.670 --> 00:39:09.830
which he was part of, the Aztec
eagle, which he was part of,

00:39:09.830 --> 00:39:11.730
that is, the Farm Workers Movement.

00:39:11.730 --> 00:39:14.300
It all blends in.

00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:18.800
All these things blend
in and become one.

00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:25.280
The indigenous origins of the
first peoples of this hemisphere,

00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:29.480
their texts that have been
translated into English,

00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:32.930
and then were translated into -- I
mean to Spanish and then English,

00:39:32.930 --> 00:39:37.730
and the poetic eye and the poetic
imagination of our new generations,

00:39:37.730 --> 00:39:40.640 position:56%
in the '60s in this case, where many

00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:45.300
of my friends and I
came to be poets.

00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:51.540
And that's Jose Montoya, the great
poet, the great muralist, who,

00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:55.210
once again, is not known at large.

00:39:55.210 --> 00:39:58.340
And yet if you go to
Latino, Mexicano, Chicano,

00:39:58.340 --> 00:40:00.480
Chicano communities and
you say Jose Montoya,

00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:02.050
they go, yeah, Jose Montoya.

00:40:02.050 --> 00:40:08.510
So we're saying yeah, yeah,
Jose Montoya here today, too.

[ Applause ]

00:40:16.650 --> 00:40:27.700 position:56%
Let's see what that land looked like
when I was a kid, as me and my mom

00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:31.740
and my father's colossal
army truck [laughter].

00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:36.110
Looks like he actually
built that, tool,

00:40:36.110 --> 00:40:38.380
that he got in El Paso
at Fort Bliss.

00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:40.580
And there's my mom
and -- holding me.

00:40:40.580 --> 00:40:43.460
I'm looking philosophically
at the camera.

00:40:44.550 --> 00:40:51.000
And there's me again after planting
corn with my father in a little lot

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:55.820
in Escondido owned
by La Familia Garcia.

00:40:55.820 --> 00:40:58.340
And I'm kind of upset
there because there's a lot

00:40:58.340 --> 00:40:59.960
of spiders in the cornfields.

00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:02.440
And if you're just running
through the cornfields,

00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:05.340
you're going to find a spider
right here stuck to your cheek,

00:41:05.340 --> 00:41:07.140
and you say, hello,
spider [laughter].

00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:12.510
I'd like to move on, okay?

00:41:12.510 --> 00:41:15.940
[ Laughter ]

00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:19.970
So that's me there,
and that's how I began.

00:41:19.970 --> 00:41:24.010
My mother, the storyteller
out in the open.

00:41:24.010 --> 00:41:26.090
And the cornfield.

00:41:26.090 --> 00:41:29.610
And that world at the
margin of the big city.

00:41:29.610 --> 00:41:32.880
Speaking Spanish only.

00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:35.680
And hearing the great
stories of my parents.

00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:37.520
My father, who had many stories.

00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:40.000
And my mother who was a
storyteller and poet who liked

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:44.190
to stand up unexpectedly.

00:41:44.190 --> 00:41:46.810
And then school days.

00:41:46.810 --> 00:41:49.110
First grade.

00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:54.340
I had a hard time in first grade --

00:41:58.420 --> 00:42:00.200
-- only knowing Spanish.

00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:03.970
I didn't know what a school was
or a door was or a classroom was.

00:42:08.150 --> 00:42:12.900
And being punished for speaking
Spanish the first 10 seconds

00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:15.200
of class was a hard way to start.

00:42:18.180 --> 00:42:22.160
Though my teachers also saved
me a couple of years later.

00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:24.460
You know Mrs. Sampson,
remember Mrs. Sampson.

00:42:24.460 --> 00:42:25.760

00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:27.060
&gt;&gt; Jose Felipe Herrera: Yes.

00:42:27.060 --> 00:42:29.700
My third grade teacher who said,
"You have a beautiful voice."

00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:31.000
And that took care of it.

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:34.450
And that's what I'm
saying to you today, too.

00:42:34.450 --> 00:42:37.370
I'm still saying that
because she said that.

00:42:37.370 --> 00:42:39.220
You have a beautiful voice.

00:42:39.220 --> 00:42:42.310
And we say that here at the
Library of Congress because full

00:42:42.310 --> 00:42:48.160
of beautiful voices and
you have a beautiful voice.

00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:49.610
Alurista.

00:42:49.610 --> 00:42:51.510

00:42:57.170 --> 00:42:58.710
He's from Acapulco.

00:42:58.710 --> 00:43:00.200
He was from -- he's from Acapulco.

00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:04.110
He's one of my -- we
met in middle school.

00:43:04.110 --> 00:43:07.720
Came over to my little apartment my
father had found downtown San Diego

00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:13.580
on Broadway, 11th and D Street,
next to Broadway, San Diego.

00:43:13.580 --> 00:43:17.040
And someone knocked on my
door, my one-room apartment,

00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:23.150 position:56%
our one-room apartment, and he said,
-- I opened the door [inaudible].

00:43:23.150 --> 00:43:27.230
He says, [foreign words]
do you have any paper?

00:43:27.230 --> 00:43:28.800
I go, "paper?

00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:30.410
Of course I got paper.

00:43:30.410 --> 00:43:32.300
Of course I got paper.

00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:33.600
School just started."

00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:34.960
You know, you get those 500 pounds

00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:38.590
of paper [laughter]
and a big old binder.

00:43:38.590 --> 00:43:40.700
"Of course."

00:43:40.700 --> 00:43:42.830
"Okay, can I borrow some?"

00:43:42.830 --> 00:43:46.290
And now freeze that frame
because what happened was

00:43:46.290 --> 00:43:50.560
that he became a pioneer
in Chicano poetry

00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:56.490
that influenced thousands a few
years later after high school.

00:43:56.490 --> 00:44:00.750
But that's how we met each other,
asking each other, asking for paper

00:44:00.750 --> 00:44:04.550
and giving each other paper,
and taking him to school,

00:44:04.550 --> 00:44:10.480 position:56%
and hanging out, and talking about
many things, including Aztec history

00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:13.100
and language and symbols.

00:44:13.100 --> 00:44:17.860
As a matter of fact, he brought out
a great Aztec term called Aztlan,

00:44:17.860 --> 00:44:23.860
the land of the North Country, the
Aztec land of the North Country,

00:44:23.860 --> 00:44:27.790
the origin of migration
south to Mexico City.

00:44:27.790 --> 00:44:29.200
And he said, "You know
what that is?"

00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:30.500
I go, "Wow, what is that?

00:44:30.500 --> 00:44:31.800
I'm doing my homework.

00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:33.100
What is it.

00:44:33.100 --> 00:44:34.400
What are you talking about?"

00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:36.690
"Aztlan." I go, "Okay,
Aztlan, and, and, and?"

00:44:36.690 --> 00:44:38.910
"It's the Southwest, Juan.

00:44:38.910 --> 00:44:40.210
It's the Southwest."

00:44:40.210 --> 00:44:42.010
"Okay. How come it's
not on the map?"

00:44:42.010 --> 00:44:46.330
[ Laughter ]

00:44:46.330 --> 00:44:48.680
He says, "Oh, come
on, Juan," he says.

00:44:48.680 --> 00:44:53.080
"We have to rewrite the map.

00:44:53.080 --> 00:44:54.450
That's what poets do."

00:44:54.450 --> 00:44:57.880
I go, "Oh, a poet, huh?

00:44:57.880 --> 00:44:59.530
Okay. Okay.

00:44:59.530 --> 00:45:01.000
I got some poems.

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:02.800
You want to listen to them?"

00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:05.910
[ Laughter ]

00:45:05.910 --> 00:45:07.210
He was a little bit ahead of me.

00:45:07.210 --> 00:45:10.290
So that's Alurista, you
know, a great pioneer

00:45:10.290 --> 00:45:14.210
with a great book called
<i>Floricanto </i>,

00:45:14.210 --> 00:45:17.080
[inaudible] 1971, [foreign words].

00:45:17.080 --> 00:45:27.500
So now you see that big arc
from 300/400 B.C. to 1971.

00:45:28.790 --> 00:45:33.450
This is one of his poems
called "We Played Cowboys."

00:45:33.450 --> 00:45:40.200
"We played cowboys, not knowing
[foreign words], our singers,

00:45:40.200 --> 00:45:45.980
and their continents [foreign
words], this beautiful regalia,

00:45:45.980 --> 00:45:51.700
silver embroidery on black
wool, Zapata wrote in white,

00:45:51.700 --> 00:45:58.920
campesina white and Villa in
brown [foreign words] parade

00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:05.170
of sculptured gods on
horses of flowing manes,

00:46:05.170 --> 00:46:07.350
proud, erect, they galloped.

00:46:07.350 --> 00:46:10.850
And we played cowboys
as opposed to Indians

00:46:10.850 --> 00:46:17.210
when ancestors [foreign words]
of my grandparents, charros,

00:46:17.210 --> 00:46:19.080
Indians, [foreign words].

00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:26.510
They were [foreign words] of
that central area of Mexico

00:46:26.510 --> 00:46:33.100 position:56%
and of the humid jungles of Yucatan.

00:46:33.100 --> 00:46:37.600
[Foreign words], our Mayas if we
must, cowboys play [foreign words]

00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:44.160
with moustaches [foreign words]."

00:46:46.510 --> 00:46:55.210
[ Applause ]

00:46:55.210 --> 00:46:58.990
So I would listen to him
breathe and speak and recite.

00:46:58.990 --> 00:47:02.110
I go, charros, cowboys,
[foreign words].

00:47:02.110 --> 00:47:04.370
That's English.

00:47:04.370 --> 00:47:05.670
That's Spanish.

00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:07.100
That sounds good.

00:47:07.100 --> 00:47:09.530
Wow. Pyramids.

00:47:09.530 --> 00:47:12.140
Indio's, Mayas, jungles.

00:47:12.140 --> 00:47:14.990
Oh, I was taking notes [laughter].

00:47:14.990 --> 00:47:18.900
So, you know, society
was our workshop.

00:47:18.900 --> 00:47:22.810
It is always our workshop,
whether we write alone

00:47:22.810 --> 00:47:25.310 position:56%
or whether we write out in the open.

00:47:25.310 --> 00:47:31.610
It is not possible without
social combustion, social change,

00:47:31.610 --> 00:47:36.280
and social human beings with
voices and hearts and struggles

00:47:36.280 --> 00:47:40.240
and conflicts and happiness
and joy and riding

00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:43.040
on horses in full regalia.

00:47:44.950 --> 00:47:51.260
Jose Antonio Burciaga also
passed away, a great writer.

00:47:51.260 --> 00:47:53.160
He was a muralist, too.

00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:57.650
And he painted murals at Stanford
and he wrote amazing columns

00:47:57.650 --> 00:47:59.990
about Mexican Chicano culture.

00:47:59.990 --> 00:48:06.510
He has a book called <i>Drink
Cultura </i>, <i>Drink Cultura </i>,

00:48:06.510 --> 00:48:12.840
and it's hilarious, and it's deep,
and it's piercing, and it's funny,

00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:14.860
and it's informative,
and you can serve it

00:48:14.860 --> 00:48:16.800
like hot butter on a tortilla.

00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:19.740
&gt;&gt; Yeah [laughter].

00:48:19.740 --> 00:48:23.220
&gt;&gt; Jose Felipe Herrera: But you're
going to taste that salt, too.

00:48:23.220 --> 00:48:26.620
You're going to taste that salt,
too, and that chilito, too.

00:48:26.620 --> 00:48:33.540
A great writer, a great muralist,
and a keen mind who passed away.

00:48:33.540 --> 00:48:35.520
And let us remember him as well.

00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:42.770
One of my cohorts and a great
mentor, Jose Antonio Burciaga.

00:48:42.770 --> 00:48:45.830
And there I'm attempting to
look really cool [laughter].

00:48:46.950 --> 00:48:50.170
So I want you to remember
Jose and look up his murals

00:48:50.170 --> 00:48:56.000
and see what you think about his
books and his poems and stories.

00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:03.970
Let us accept all our stories and
all our images and all our dreams.

00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:10.050
Gloria Anzaldua is
another great pioneer.

00:49:10.050 --> 00:49:16.180
Lesbian, Chicana [foreign word],
Mexican, American, [foreign word].

00:49:16.180 --> 00:49:20.270
She doesn't like one designation.

00:49:20.270 --> 00:49:22.760
She opposed one designation.

00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:24.540
She said, "I'm not one thing.

00:49:24.540 --> 00:49:29.880
I'm a person filled
with explosive borders.

00:49:29.880 --> 00:49:33.010
I am the borderlands.

00:49:33.010 --> 00:49:36.140
And there's a wound," she says.

00:49:36.140 --> 00:49:38.780
And everybody goes,
"What [laughter]?"

00:49:38.780 --> 00:49:45.370
And she says, "There is a state
that we can go into, that's a state

00:49:45.370 --> 00:49:49.330
of Coatlicue, the Coatlicue.

00:49:49.330 --> 00:49:53.590
You mean the Goddess of the Aztecs?

00:49:53.590 --> 00:49:58.130
You mean the goddess that wears
serpent skirts and death skulls

00:49:58.130 --> 00:50:04.060
as belts, and has claw feet,
and stands very, very tall,

00:50:04.060 --> 00:50:06.170
made out of stone, Coatlicue?

00:50:06.170 --> 00:50:09.730
A state of Coatlicue?

00:50:09.730 --> 00:50:12.650
What on Earth is that?

00:50:12.650 --> 00:50:16.450
But she was reshaping
and reinvestigating

00:50:16.450 --> 00:50:20.340 position:56%
that Nahuatl Mashika ancient culture

00:50:20.340 --> 00:50:28.500
which had not been
interpreted by women.

00:50:28.500 --> 00:50:34.630
And her book, <i>Mestiza Borderlands</i>
is a great change-maker,

00:50:34.630 --> 00:50:36.930
a great game-changer --

00:50:39.130 --> 00:50:41.760
-- as you'll see in the mid-'80s.

00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:44.280
This is a piece called [foreign
word] by Gloria Anzaldua.

00:50:54.040 --> 00:50:58.990
"Driving down the canyon on
a road gouged out of the side

00:50:58.990 --> 00:51:04.220
of a mountain, red, red earth,
and exposed roots sticking

00:51:04.220 --> 00:51:10.130
out like amputated
fingers, 145 acres for sale,

00:51:10.130 --> 00:51:16.940
the Indians safely locked up in
reservations or urban ghettos.

00:51:16.940 --> 00:51:23.730
Driving around the mountain inside
the car, fighting for silence.

00:51:23.730 --> 00:51:28.900
Houses stick out like pimples
on the face of the mountain.

00:51:28.900 --> 00:51:32.480
At the skirt of the
mountain ranges I met a woman

00:51:32.480 --> 00:51:38.900
from a nearby extinct
tribe, the [foreign word].

00:51:38.900 --> 00:51:43.780
Her name was [foreign
word], meaning road runner.

00:51:43.780 --> 00:51:48.370
By a stream amidst the gushing
water under the olive wooly head

00:51:48.370 --> 00:51:51.060
of the mountain I met her.

00:51:51.060 --> 00:51:53.680
Under the Encina Tree I sat.

00:51:53.680 --> 00:51:58.600
She emerged out of the smooth amber
flesh of the manzanita in sandals

00:51:58.600 --> 00:52:03.980
of woven yucca, skin
polished bronze by the sun.

00:52:03.980 --> 00:52:09.870
She appeared with a tattoo on her
arm, pricked by cactus thorns,

00:52:09.870 --> 00:52:15.130 position:56%
ground charcoal rubbed on the wound.

00:52:15.130 --> 00:52:18.430
There's a forest fire
on the Cuyamaca Peaks,

00:52:18.430 --> 00:52:20.890
a sign, four parcels for sale.

00:52:20.890 --> 00:52:24.160
The Indians locked

00:52:24.160 --> 00:52:28.150
up in reservations [foreign words]
behind glass in the museum."

00:52:28.150 --> 00:52:46.630
Gloria Anzaldua, great pioneer,
also passed away a few years ago.

00:52:46.630 --> 00:52:54.340
So I'm glad we have a chance to say
hi and to meet them and see them

00:52:54.340 --> 00:52:57.400
and hear a few of their
works and notice

00:52:57.400 --> 00:53:00.650
that they were great
pioneers, speaking at a time

00:53:00.650 --> 00:53:05.440
when it was difficult to speak.

00:53:05.440 --> 00:53:12.450
Many forces working against us
and them, and yet they continued

00:53:12.450 --> 00:53:19.490
and forged ahead, and became
game-changers with words,

00:53:19.490 --> 00:53:23.940
with beautiful poetry,
with art and stories

00:53:23.940 --> 00:53:27.470
and a deep compassionate heart.

00:53:27.470 --> 00:53:33.940
Ray Gonzalez is also from El Paso
and he knows all about Juarez.

00:53:33.940 --> 00:53:38.950
And he's a great collector
of poems and a great person

00:53:38.950 --> 00:53:41.340
that puts a lot of
anthologies together.

00:53:41.340 --> 00:53:44.860
I tell Ray, "You saved
me in the '90s, Ray.

00:53:44.860 --> 00:53:47.060
I was going down.

00:53:47.060 --> 00:53:49.760
I wasn't publishing anything.

00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:51.440
Thank you."

00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:55.380
You know, our good friends who
are editors and our good friends

00:53:55.380 --> 00:53:59.860
who are critics of
literature, and they love it.

00:53:59.860 --> 00:54:01.840
And they look out for us writers,

00:54:01.840 --> 00:54:04.080
and they go, "I want
a poem from you.

00:54:04.080 --> 00:54:06.820
I'm putting together a book."

00:54:06.820 --> 00:54:10.190
And we are not -- we cannot
be poets without our editors,

00:54:10.190 --> 00:54:15.710
without our thinkers, without
our people that put many hours

00:54:15.710 --> 00:54:19.240
into collecting those
poems and creating a book.

00:54:19.240 --> 00:54:23.830
But we have a little press of
time because with our poem.

00:54:28.080 --> 00:54:29.390
Ray Gonzalez.

00:54:29.390 --> 00:54:34.970
He has many books, one recently
published in Belgium, a Chatbook.

00:54:38.120 --> 00:54:46.080
I'm looking for at this point
who is also a great poet.

00:54:46.080 --> 00:54:49.250
And she decided to just come
on all the way out and talk

00:54:49.250 --> 00:54:53.410
about being a Superwoman Chicana.

00:54:53.410 --> 00:54:55.570
She didn't hold back [laughter].

00:54:55.570 --> 00:54:56.870
She didn't hold back.

00:54:56.870 --> 00:55:04.380 position:56%
I don't think any male ever said I'm
a super, super, Superman Chicano.

00:55:04.380 --> 00:55:06.680
I don't think there's
any such thing.

00:55:06.680 --> 00:55:08.410
So it just came straight on out.

00:55:08.410 --> 00:55:11.370
And it was a very fun
book, a very good book,

00:55:11.370 --> 00:55:15.970
and Gloria Velasquez
an excellent poet.

00:55:18.040 --> 00:55:20.080
I want to read you part
of one of her poems called

00:55:20.080 --> 00:55:22.940
"Days Gone by in Orange County."

00:55:25.620 --> 00:55:30.650
"I mourn for those days gone by,
the slim-waisted girl I once was,

00:55:30.650 --> 00:55:33.210
dressed in beads, the
bearded Chicano

00:55:33.210 --> 00:55:40.300
at my side screaming obscenities
at the crowds, waving Peace signs,

00:55:40.300 --> 00:55:45.900
drinking beer in honky-tonk
bars, with cowboy and his dogs,

00:55:45.900 --> 00:55:51.150
and the Beatles, and the
smell of stale muscatel.

00:55:51.150 --> 00:55:53.900
I mourn for those days gone by.

00:55:53.900 --> 00:55:56.100
Martin Luther King, Junior.

00:55:56.100 --> 00:55:58.780
Nigger-lovers they shouted at us.

00:55:58.780 --> 00:56:02.530
[Inaudible] and food-stamps,
Vietnam pouring out of the cracks,

00:56:02.530 --> 00:56:05.770
the smell of Fenni's
[assumed spelling] burnt skin,

00:56:05.770 --> 00:56:08.700
the closed coffin, and
my mother's screams.

00:56:08.700 --> 00:56:13.140
I curse those days gone by
sitting here in my office,

00:56:13.140 --> 00:56:17.930
surrounded by mediocrity, academic
pimps, Martin Luther Kind dead

00:56:17.930 --> 00:56:23.020
on the wall, letters from Vietnam
neatly stacked on the shelf.

00:56:23.020 --> 00:56:25.310
No more stale muscatel.

00:56:25.310 --> 00:56:27.700
No more bearded Chicano.

00:56:27.700 --> 00:56:30.510
No more days gone by."

00:56:30.510 --> 00:56:39.720
[ Applause ]

00:56:39.720 --> 00:56:41.610
I want you to meet Victor Martinez,

00:56:41.610 --> 00:56:45.120
another pioneer of
"Flower and Song."

00:56:45.120 --> 00:56:48.480
If there was ever a
thinker, it was Victor.

00:56:48.480 --> 00:56:52.130
If there ever was a deep
thinker, it was Victor.

00:56:52.130 --> 00:56:57.270
If there ever was someone who
could write forever and never go

00:56:57.270 --> 00:57:02.970
out of the house or the
room, it was Victor.

00:57:05.090 --> 00:57:08.550
I used to say, "Victor,
I just turned out a poem.

00:57:08.550 --> 00:57:09.850
How about you?

00:57:09.850 --> 00:57:11.150
What do you got?"

00:57:11.150 --> 00:57:14.800
"Uh, I'm editing my poem poem."

00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:16.570
"But what do you got?"

00:57:16.570 --> 00:57:18.510
"I got two pages."

00:57:18.510 --> 00:57:20.080
"Two pages?

00:57:20.080 --> 00:57:23.050
I sent out like 400 pages
yesterday [laughter]."

00:57:24.230 --> 00:57:25.720
"I'm working on the
lines [laughter].

00:57:25.720 --> 00:57:29.160
I need to polish my lines."

00:57:29.160 --> 00:57:30.460
"Come on, Victor.

00:57:30.460 --> 00:57:32.590
Just send it out."

00:57:32.590 --> 00:57:35.120
"I'm looking at the terms, Juan.

00:57:35.120 --> 00:57:37.250
It's important.

00:57:37.250 --> 00:57:38.800
Okay?

00:57:38.800 --> 00:57:41.040
[ Laughter ]

00:57:41.040 --> 00:57:43.510
I don't know about you, but
I want to take my time."

00:57:43.510 --> 00:57:46.200
[ Laughter ]

00:57:46.200 --> 00:57:49.170
And sure enough, I had a
billion typos in those poems

00:57:49.170 --> 00:57:51.260
that I published [laughter].

00:57:51.260 --> 00:57:52.850
And guess what.

00:57:52.850 --> 00:57:56.100
Victor won the National
Book Award --

00:57:56.100 --> 00:57:57.400
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:57:57.400 --> 00:57:59.200
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera:
-- in 1996 --

00:57:59.200 --> 00:58:07.450
[ Applause ]

00:58:07.450 --> 00:58:10.350
-- for <i>A Parrot in the
Oven </i>, a young adult novel,

00:58:10.350 --> 00:58:14.870
and a hard-hitting young adult
novel, <i>A Parrot in the Oven </i>.

00:58:14.870 --> 00:58:16.830
So I want you to meet
Victor for a moment.

00:58:16.830 --> 00:58:20.730
He also passed away, a young man.

00:58:20.730 --> 00:58:25.670
It's called "Along the River" from
his book, <i>Caring for a House </i>,

00:58:25.670 --> 00:58:30.550
published by Chusma Press
in San Jose in the mid-'80s.

00:58:30.550 --> 00:58:32.830
"Along the River."

00:58:32.830 --> 00:58:37.090
"There are sunrises where
everything that pains us leaves,

00:58:37.090 --> 00:58:43.690
where one's arm twisted on a
question, unravels its answer,

00:58:43.690 --> 00:58:49.070
and the fraction of a face becomes
whole, that some blossom shards

00:58:49.070 --> 00:58:53.120
of glass, opposites everywhere.

00:58:53.120 --> 00:58:56.260
Yet none of them touches us.

00:58:56.260 --> 00:59:00.720
We're in a forest gummed
together by light,

00:59:00.720 --> 00:59:04.630
beside a river whose
currents are feathers,

00:59:04.630 --> 00:59:11.730
twittering to become wind
before the sun shreds them madly

00:59:11.730 --> 00:59:13.680
to their source.

00:59:13.680 --> 00:59:19.210
And after the seedless sowing
of late afternoon shadows,

00:59:19.210 --> 00:59:23.680
when the forest moves at
the speed the sun pulls,

00:59:23.680 --> 00:59:29.480
we say this is what I am.

00:59:29.480 --> 00:59:33.120
A sky frightened, a sky
of frightened birds,

00:59:33.120 --> 00:59:37.240
an unmapped constellation
of pores, morning

00:59:37.240 --> 00:59:42.220
and night forever stroking
the wheel with each hand.

00:59:42.220 --> 00:59:47.510
Sun, moon, all the rest."

Lucha Corpi is also a great pioneer,

a founder of the Centralist [foreign

01:00:05.100 --> 01:00:06.400
the Francisco [foreign word].

01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:13.420
Lucha Corpi from Vera Cruz,
the Atlantic coast of Mexico.

01:00:13.420 --> 01:00:18.180
And very interested in translating
her work in Spanish into English

01:00:18.180 --> 01:00:22.630
and working with a
translator, and her own poetry.

"In the opening and shutting
of an eye full of magic clocks

The wind murmurs melancholy as the
all's well of the night watchman

who looked after my parents' house.

I go back every winter lest I forget
who I am and where I come from.

The rain comes down singing towards
its destiny of mineral and seed.

wing and the lowering of violets

in repose, we learn
to love, in instants

01:01:05.350 --> 01:01:11.180
and surrenders in-between the
intimate question posed by night

01:01:11.180 --> 01:01:16.160
and the dark sweet
reply given by dawn.

01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:20.460
We engender in pain a new life.

01:01:20.460 --> 01:01:25.270
Nothing is fixed or
perpetual, not rain or seed

01:01:25.270 --> 01:01:29.010
or you or I or our grief.

01:01:29.010 --> 01:01:36.120 position:56%
In this world that is fleeting
because we're forever cutting paths,

01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:42.630
opening our way along unfamiliar
roads, conquering the fury

01:01:42.630 --> 01:01:48.020
of oblivion verse by verse."

01:01:48.020 --> 01:01:49.820
"Winter Song" by Lucha Corpi.

01:01:49.820 --> 01:01:58.560
[ Applause ]

01:01:58.560 --> 01:02:02.510
And let's go back to
Francisco Alarcon.

01:02:02.510 --> 01:02:06.480
[ Applause ]

01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:08.720
He just lived life.

01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:10.040
He lived life.

01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:11.340
"Juan Felipe."

01:02:11.340 --> 01:02:13.520
"Yes." "Let's go have some dinner."

01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:15.730
"But it's 11:30."

01:02:15.730 --> 01:02:17.030
"Let's go [laughter]."

01:02:17.030 --> 01:02:18.530
"Where we going?"

01:02:18.530 --> 01:02:19.830
"Guadalajara de Noche,"

01:02:19.830 --> 01:02:22.020
a great Mexican restaurant
in the Mission District.

01:02:22.020 --> 01:02:23.320
I said, "Okay.

01:02:23.320 --> 01:02:24.620
And what are we going to do."

01:02:24.620 --> 01:02:25.920
"We're going to talk poetry, Juan.

01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:27.220
What else is there?"

01:02:27.220 --> 01:02:28.520
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:31.850
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera:
He was a great scholar.

01:02:31.850 --> 01:02:38.280
Like I said, a great pioneer of
Nahuatl text in a whole new format

01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:41.330
and idiom that no one
has really written about.

01:02:41.330 --> 01:02:45.920
So I'm presenting to you a pioneer
that has not really been examined,

01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:50.160
given his writing corpus,
what he's really provided

01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:52.440
that no one else has provided.

01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:53.870
"Flower and Song" pioneer.

01:02:53.870 --> 01:02:56.850
This is called "Mestizo."

01:02:56.850 --> 01:03:02.810
"My name is not Francisco.

01:03:02.810 --> 01:03:10.900
There is an Arab within me who
prays three times each day.

01:03:10.900 --> 01:03:19.430
Behind my Roman nose there
is a Phoenician smiling.

01:03:19.430 --> 01:03:28.270
My eyes still see Seville,
but my mouth is [inaudible].

01:03:28.270 --> 01:03:30.940
My dark hands are Toltec.

01:03:30.940 --> 01:03:35.680
My cheek bones fierce Chichimeca.

01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:43.060
My feet recognize no border,
no rule, no code, no lord,

01:03:43.060 --> 01:03:48.260
for this wanderer's heart,
for this wanderer's heart."

01:03:50.510 --> 01:03:58.960
[ Applause ]

01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:01.370
Let me present to you Gary Soto.

01:04:01.370 --> 01:04:04.010
You know Gary.

01:04:04.010 --> 01:04:07.240
He has many, many, many
books for children,

01:04:07.240 --> 01:04:09.480
almost in every school
in the nation.

01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:10.780
A great writer.

01:04:10.780 --> 01:04:12.580
Also from Fresno, the
capital of poetry.

01:04:12.580 --> 01:04:24.280
[ Laughter ]

01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:28.010
Of course, Fresno is
everywhere [laughter].

01:04:28.010 --> 01:04:29.310
&gt;&gt; Yes.

01:04:29.310 --> 01:04:31.560
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera:
And in the mid-'70s

01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:35.170
around the same time Carolyn Forche
put out <i>Gathering the Tribes </i>,

01:04:35.170 --> 01:04:38.410
it was kind of a pivotal
year in some wild way.

01:04:38.410 --> 01:04:43.050
Carolyn Forche's book, wild
and tense, terse, short lines,

01:04:43.050 --> 01:04:45.760
incredible, that could cut
you down in 10 seconds flat.

01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:49.150
I love that book, <i>Gathering
the Tribes </i>.

01:04:49.150 --> 01:04:54.370
And Gary Soto, all of a
sudden is writing in English.

01:04:54.370 --> 01:05:01.100
The Aztecs are in there somewhere
but they're not in the same manner.

01:05:01.100 --> 01:05:02.770
And it's not bilingual.

01:05:02.770 --> 01:05:04.070
And it's in English.

01:05:04.070 --> 01:05:06.000
And it feels good.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.640
All of a sudden it feels good.

01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:14.420
And Gary presents that new
interesting redirection as well

01:05:14.420 --> 01:05:16.230
as everything else
that was taking place.

01:05:16.230 --> 01:05:20.930
This is called "Field" from
the <i>Elements of San Joaquin </i>.

01:05:20.930 --> 01:05:23.880
"The wind sprays pale
dirt into my mouth.

01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:29.250
The small, almost invisible scars
on my hands, the pores in my throat

01:05:29.250 --> 01:05:34.420
and elbows have taken in a
seed of dirt of their own.

01:05:34.420 --> 01:05:41.350
After a day in the grape fields
near Rolinda, I'll find silt washed

01:05:41.350 --> 01:05:48.120
by sweat has settled into the
lines on the wrists and palms.

01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:50.390
Already I'm becoming the valley,

01:05:50.390 --> 01:05:56.510
a soil that sprouts
nothing for any of us."

01:05:56.510 --> 01:06:04.160
[ Applause ]

01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:05.460
Everybody reads Gary Soto.

01:06:05.460 --> 01:06:08.410
Whenever I meet young
people, "I like Gary Soto.

01:06:08.410 --> 01:06:10.350
I love Gary Soto, Juan.

01:06:10.350 --> 01:06:11.650
I love Gary."

01:06:11.650 --> 01:06:14.110
I said, "I'm glad you love Gary.

01:06:14.110 --> 01:06:15.860
I'm glad you love Gary.

01:06:15.860 --> 01:06:17.160
That's good.

01:06:17.160 --> 01:06:18.460
That's good, you know.

01:06:18.460 --> 01:06:25.380
Reading those great books, young
adult books and poetry books."

01:06:25.380 --> 01:06:29.150
Raul Salinas, Raul Salinas.

01:06:29.150 --> 01:06:34.790
And here you see -- this is 1973
at USC, November 13th and 14th

01:06:34.790 --> 01:06:38.250
when we had the first
Chicano Literature conference

01:06:38.250 --> 01:06:42.600
that where we came together
for the first time ever at USC.

01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:43.900
And at USC [laughter].

01:06:43.900 --> 01:06:48.950 position:56%
It was one of Alurista's ideas, too,

01:06:48.950 --> 01:06:51.530
because it was called
[foreign words].

01:06:51.530 --> 01:06:53.430
Once again, "Flower and
Song," [foreign words].

01:06:53.430 --> 01:06:58.130
This keeps on coming
up and continues.

01:06:58.130 --> 01:07:00.280
It doesn't really ends.

01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:04.520
And, of course, here we have
our great pioneers, too.

01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:11.510
[Inaudible], great scholar
in literature on the right,

01:07:11.510 --> 01:07:14.330
and Rolando [foreign
words] Smith as well,

01:07:14.330 --> 01:07:20.150
and [foreign words] a great poet
and educator and also storywriter,

01:07:20.150 --> 01:07:26.590
fiction writer, a innovative
pioneering trio that moved us,

01:07:26.590 --> 01:07:30.060 position:56%
very much so, and inspired us, 1973.

01:07:30.060 --> 01:07:37.130
And also in 1973, in the same
conference, we have Raul Salinas.

01:07:37.130 --> 01:07:38.690
What a guy.

01:07:38.690 --> 01:07:44.250
Raul Salinas, with a swagger
and a hit band and tattoos

01:07:44.250 --> 01:07:49.340
and the big deep baritone
voice, and great poems that kind

01:07:49.340 --> 01:07:52.270
of astonished us, that
we couldn't believe it.

01:07:52.270 --> 01:07:59.440
And he said something like
this at the conference,

01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:01.340 position:56%
like in this mode that you see here.

01:08:01.340 --> 01:08:04.620
And, of course, you
know, he came from the --

01:08:04.620 --> 01:08:09.380
from like the barrios where we
all came from, and from Texas,

01:08:09.380 --> 01:08:14.180 position:56%
and he had served a number of years
in Leavenworth for minor infractions

01:08:14.180 --> 01:08:16.960
that just kept on piling up.

01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:19.160
And they just kept on piling up.

01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:20.460
And he was out.

01:08:20.460 --> 01:08:21.760
He was fresh out, feeling great.

01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:25.580
And he had a poem called,
a poem, a very popular,

01:08:25.580 --> 01:08:31.580
a famous poem where he talks about
being a pachuco, being a, you know,

01:08:31.580 --> 01:08:34.700
a borderlands youth with a swagger

01:08:34.700 --> 01:08:38.310
and a whole new style
called a pachuco.

01:08:38.310 --> 01:08:43.490
Early days, in the '30s,
back in Cuka's days

01:08:43.490 --> 01:08:46.480
where the pachuco was born
in Juarez and El Paso.

01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:49.680
And that's a whole other story.

01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:51.660
He said, that's a loco dig on what?

01:08:51.660 --> 01:08:54.580
What them dudes are saying
that you write [foreign word],

01:08:54.580 --> 01:08:59.430
a non-goal-oriented being
who fear an identity crisis.

01:08:59.430 --> 01:09:01.870
[Foreign word] This guy, he's
[inaudible] and you boogied

01:09:01.870 --> 01:09:07.980
into [inaudible] and to U.S.
naval battlegrounds, room one.

01:09:07.980 --> 01:09:09.280
The pachuco's a pachuco.

01:09:09.280 --> 01:09:13.700 position:56%
Room two. Everything you ever wanted
to know about a pachuco, room three,

01:09:13.700 --> 01:09:16.510 position:56%
the post-modern view of pachuconess.

01:09:16.510 --> 01:09:20.690
[ Laughter ]

01:09:20.690 --> 01:09:22.370
Everybody going, what did he say?

01:09:22.370 --> 01:09:24.620
Pachuco? Room one?

01:09:24.620 --> 01:09:27.230
That just sprang --
He had a whole thing

01:09:27.230 --> 01:09:31.940
about what anthropologists
were saying at that time

01:09:31.940 --> 01:09:38.870
about young Mexican Chicanos in
barrios, that they were alienated,

01:09:38.870 --> 01:09:42.370
that they were non-goal-oriented.

01:09:42.370 --> 01:09:47.770
So he decided to respond with his
poetry in this particular poem, oh,

01:09:47.770 --> 01:09:49.780
you loco dig on what
them dudes are saying

01:09:49.780 --> 01:09:52.010
that you are non-goal-oriented
being, so feel an identity crisis.

01:09:52.010 --> 01:09:53.310
[ Laughter ]

01:09:53.310 --> 01:09:56.110
And with that big booming voice

01:09:56.110 --> 01:09:59.630
and his great tasty style,
we were really moved.

01:09:59.630 --> 01:10:01.050
And he also passed away.

01:10:01.050 --> 01:10:07.680
One of our great pioneers
and bilingual, indigenous.

01:10:07.680 --> 01:10:13.310
He spent many years in the
Indian Movement and a true --

01:10:13.310 --> 01:10:20.620
a true seeker and partner of
Indian Nations, United States.

01:10:20.620 --> 01:10:23.220
And his poetry came out of that,

01:10:23.220 --> 01:10:29.350
so he kind of encompassed the
entire sphere of the Chicano,

01:10:29.350 --> 01:10:32.930
Mexican experience in the
United States from all levels.

01:10:32.930 --> 01:10:40.920
And I'm so honored to have
known him Raul Salinas.

01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:46.270
His latest book -- his last book
was called <i>Indio Trails </i>which is a

01:10:46.270 --> 01:10:49.460
beautiful, beautiful collection.

01:10:49.460 --> 01:10:52.960
Let us go back to Jose Montoya
just a little bit as we begin

01:10:52.960 --> 01:11:00.200
to close the pioneer, flote cato,
pioneers, flour and salt pioneers.

01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:04.010
Jose Montoya, we saw a little
bit of his artwork earlier on.

01:11:04.010 --> 01:11:07.820
Jose Montoya was in the Korean
-- served in the Korean War.

01:11:07.820 --> 01:11:10.610
Jose Montoya was from
Fowler, where I was born.

01:11:10.610 --> 01:11:13.290
Jose Montoya worked in the
fields, his whole family worked

01:11:13.290 --> 01:11:16.550
in the fields, and as you know,
Jose Montoya was a great muralist.

01:11:16.550 --> 01:11:21.330
I'd like you to explore his
murals, art, music, song,

01:11:21.330 --> 01:11:23.780
painting, poetry, community.

01:11:23.780 --> 01:11:25.750
This is a song, this is from --

01:11:25.750 --> 01:11:28.060
I'm going to read a little bit
of the poem that he wrote for,

01:11:28.060 --> 01:11:35.640
called "La Jefita," La Jefita, our
dear mothers, Mi Jefita, my mother.

01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:42.000 position:56%
Mi Jefito, my father, and of course,
this is our terms that we use

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:43.790
of endearment, of endearment.

01:11:43.790 --> 01:11:49.210
And he describes that
his mom in the morning.

01:11:49.210 --> 01:11:55.450
"A noisy chorro spill,
missing the basin.

01:11:55.450 --> 01:11:57.220
Que horas son, ama?

01:11:57.220 --> 01:11:59.170
What time is it, mom?

01:11:59.170 --> 01:12:00.590
Es tarde, me hijito.

01:12:00.590 --> 01:12:01.920
It's late.

01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:03.220
Cover up your little brothers.

01:12:03.220 --> 01:12:09.830
Y yo con pena, but too
sleepy and I felt kind

01:12:09.830 --> 01:12:13.000
of ashamed, but too sleepy.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.110
Get to bed little mother.

01:12:15.110 --> 01:12:17.440
A maternal reply mingled
with the hissing

01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:22.640
of the hot planchas,
those hot ironing irons.

01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:27.010
Y los frijoles de la hoya and
the frijoles steaming up on

01:12:27.010 --> 01:12:29.990
that big kettle, boiling musically.

01:12:29.990 --> 01:12:32.740
Danto segunda, give
it a second tone.

01:12:32.740 --> 01:12:35.760
A los ruidos nocturnos, the
night sounds and the snores

01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:39.800
of the old man, lulling
sounds, e los peros,

01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:41.900
and the dogs, ladrando, barking.

01:12:41.900 --> 01:12:44.680
Then the familiar hallucinations
just before sleep.

01:12:44.680 --> 01:12:47.670
And my jefita, no more.

01:12:47.670 --> 01:12:49.040
But then it was time to get up.

01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:51.000
My old man had a chiflidito, a
little whistle [whistling sounds].

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:56.830
That irritated the
world to wakefulness.

01:12:56.830 --> 01:13:05.320
[Whistling sounds] Ariba
cabrones chavalos, get up there.

01:13:05.320 --> 01:13:25.040
What's the matter with
you [laughter]?
