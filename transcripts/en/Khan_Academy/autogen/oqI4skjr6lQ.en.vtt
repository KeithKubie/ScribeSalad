00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500
 When talking about antigen-presenting cells, 

00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.530
 When talking about antigen-presenting cells, 

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:06.130
 we learned that they can swallow it first. 

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:09.700
 I will draw my best 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.450
 dendritic cell. 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:13.120
 Perhaps it should be simpler. 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.990
 The dendritic cell is a phagocyte and is antigen-presenting 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:17.860
 cell. 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:22.630
 After the phagocytosis of some pathogen, she did 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.550
 fragment and represent 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:35.990
 the antigen on its surface of a protein complex. I will paint it in red. 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:38.380
 The crushed part of the pathogen 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.040
 is placed here. 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.000
 In the clip for antigen-presenting cells, 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.570
 that this complex here is MHC Class II. 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:01:02.750
 MHC means &amp; quot; major histopathoblastic complex &amp; quot ;. 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.800
 &amp; Quot; Histocompatibility &amp; quot; means compatibility of tissues. 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.980
 This is the case for antigen-presenting cells. 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:10.550
 Even B-cells do it. 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.390
 I will draw a B-cell. 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.900
 It has membrane bound 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.770
 antibody. Here it is. 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.220
 In fact, they are thousands. 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.130
 I will draw a few, but know that 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:26.700
 are more than one. 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.560
 Perhaps one of them is triggered or attached 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.730
 to some floating virus, protein or bacteria. 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:41.340
 The cage absorbs and crushes it 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.760
 just like a dendritic cell. 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:56.620
 I will tear some of it and present it to the surface 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:01.170
 on MHC class II. 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.320
 I repeat, this is MHC class II. 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.680
 These professional antigen-presenting cells 

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:13.460
 pull out bodies flying 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:17.190
 in the fluids of our bodies. 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.860
 They swallow them up, declare they are bad, crush them 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.770
 and present them on MHC Class II. 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.010
 That's why we call them professional antigen-presenting 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.480
 cells. 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:35.530
 It turns out that this applies to almost all cells in the human body. 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.070
 I say "almost everyone" because I mean 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:39.480
 all eukaryotic cells. 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.190
 The only cells that have no core, 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.370
 in the human body they are 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.600
 red blood cells. This is extremely interesting. 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.310
 So they have more storage space for hemoglobin. 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.040
 All eukaryotic cells in the human body have 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:05.650
 another major histocompatibility complex, 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.530
 called MHC Class I. 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.770
 These are also eukaryotic cells 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:16.000
 therefore they also have MHC class I 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.240
 right here. 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:21.040
 Interestingly, every human 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:30.950
 eukaryotic cell has MHC class I, besides 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:36.010
 of red blood cells. 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.870
 If something unusual happens 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:39.910
 in the cage - for example 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.260
 it is malignant and produces strange proteins, 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.130
 infected with a virus 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.430
 or there is some bacteria or strange protein in it, 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.080
 every cell in the human body can crush it, 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.460
 even if it is malfunctioning, and 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:55.090
 to present it. 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:56.930
 For example, if the cell is malignant 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.350
 and contains strange proteins, 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.140
 represented only by the cancer cells, 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.740
 and are not normal for ordinary cells, 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:07.140
 this will be presented on MHC Class I. 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:13.220
 For example, if I have some other cell in my body, 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:14.095
 which is of another type. 

00:04:14.095 --> 00:04:15.370
 She is eukaryotic. 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.865
 For example, it's infected with a virus. 

00:04:18.865 --> 00:04:23.390
 It starts producing viruses. 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:25.980
 By the same mechanisms the cell 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:30.230
 takes several of the virus-forming proteins 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:33.245
 and presents them on MHC Class I. 

00:04:33.245 --> 00:04:38.230
 and will present them on MHC Class I. 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:42.250
 In MHC class II, this has suggested 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.130
 of T-helper: 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.160
 "I found a floating body. 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.930
 Here's a piece of it. 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.290
 Why do not you connect with him and do not trigger the alarm? " 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:54.950
 MHC Class I says: 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:55.880
 "This is not a floating body. 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:56.820
 I'm infected. 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:57.850
 I'm malign 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:58.950
 and go crazy. 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:59.970
 Better kill me. 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.280
 I'm a virus and I'm producing viruses. 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:03.370
 Destroy me. " 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:08.640
 This message reaches cytotoxic T cells 

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.710
 and this is the theme of this video. 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:12.920
 I want to make sure you understand 

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:14.250
 difference. First - T cells. 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.390
 These two cells have T-cell receptors, but 

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:20.405
 T-helper binds to MHC class II. 

00:05:20.405 --> 00:05:24.890
 T-helper binds to MHC class II. 

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:28.680
 This is a T-helper. 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:33.640
 Only the T-helper they have 

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:36.470
 the right variable region, 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:39.960
 which can be connected exactly 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:44.060
 with this combination of antigen and MHC class II, 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:50.210
 will connect to it, activate, and 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:51.120
 will begin to differentiate. 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.650
 Their version versions will trigger 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:56.230
 the alarm, and their memory versions will remain, 

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:58.550
 if it had to happen again. 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:03.160
 In MHC class I, instead of attracting a T-helper, 

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:06.175
 will attract a cytotoxic T cell. 

00:06:06.175 --> 00:06:10.450
 will attract a cytotoxic T cell. 

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:14.930
 Like T-helper, T-cell receptors 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:21.540
 have a constant and variable region, 

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:26.430
 specific for this combination 

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:28.300
 antigen and MHC class II. 

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:34.400
 So maybe this cytotoxic T cell will intervene when 

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:35.995
 the cell becomes malignant. 

00:06:35.995 --> 00:06:41.680
 This cytotoxic T cell will be useless and will not connect 

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.530
 with the virus to which this one is attracted to. 

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:45.360
 You will have to do it another cytotoxic 

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.720
 T cell. 

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:49.700
 The mechanism by which we get the variable region 

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:52.970
 in T-helper, cytotoxic cells and 

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:56.360
 membrane-bound bodies in B-cells originates 

00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:00.750
 from their stage of development or 

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:05.980
 the process of ripening. Then DNA that encodes these variables 

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:08.310
 sections, is deliberately mixed. 

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:10.160
 In principle, we always try to keep it 

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.700
 DNA information, and here she mixes. 

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:17.800
 When a cytotoxic T cell detects something 

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.630
 on MHC Class I - do not forget that each 

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:25.080
 eukaryotic cell has this complex, it is activated. 

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:27.270
 For example, this cell says, "You look suspicious. 

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:29.050
 You have to die. " 

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:31.780
 It is activated as all activated cells, 

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:33.986
 begins to divide constantly 

00:07:33.986 --> 00:07:35.010
 and differentiate. 

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:37.930
 It divides and divides into cells of immune memory, 

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:41.420
 in case you need to act again - 

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:43.580
 if this type of cancer appears again, 

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:47.010
 and effector cells which 

00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:48.260
 do the killing itself. 

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.740
 do the killing itself. 

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:53.470
 This is an effector cell. 

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:56.620
 The effector cells also 

00:07:56.620 --> 00:08:00.030
 are associated with carcinogenic molecules and malignant cells, 

00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:00.770
 like this here. 

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:04.370
 For example, this cell is split 

00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:05.490
 and here is another version of it. 

00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:06.580
 That's how the cancer works. 

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:08.880
 Do it very quickly. 

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:11.930
 It produces strange proteins. 

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:15.840
 It presents them on MHC Class I - Chief 

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:21.080
 histocompatible complex, 

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:25.250
 then one of these cytotoxic effector cells 

00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:32.250
 is attracted to them. 

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:34.520
 I will not go into details about 

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:36.630
 the cause of attraction and membrane-bound proteins. 

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:38.250
 You will learn more about this, 

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:39.289
 in immunology classes. 

00:08:39.289 --> 00:08:44.310
 This cytotoxic T cell is forcing 

00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:46.790
 this cell to commit suicide in several different ways. 

00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:53.610
 The first way is to separate a group of proteins, 

00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:59.230
 called perforins. They make small holes 

00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:01.090
 in the cell membrane. 

00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:04.770
 It can also release other proteins called granzyms, 

00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:07.160
 which initiate mechanisms, 

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:09.160
 causing the cell to commit suicide. 

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:12.970
 In a very general way 

00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:17.860
 B-cells are extremely effective. When B cell 

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:20.200
 is activated, it produces antibodies that kill 

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:21.640
 different floating bodies. 

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:24.210
 When activated, it starts producing massively 

00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:25.740
 antibodies. 

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:28.970
 They sail in the human body and can connect 

00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:31.600
 with viruses, to defuse them 

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:34.680
 or mark them for macrophages or dendrites 

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:39.900
 cells and other types of phagocytes. Cytotoxic 

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:43.360
 T-cells kill cells, 

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:44.390
 which have slipped out. 

00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:46.860
 For example, cancer cells they present 

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:50.350
 strange proteins. When the virus has entered the cell, 

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:51.850
 antibodies are useless, 

00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:52.880
 because they can not get in 

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:54.450
 in the cage. 

00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:57.270
 In this case, instead of clearing the virus itself, 

00:09:57.270 --> 00:10:00.020
 the cytotoxic T cell will kill 

00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:02.300
 this cell because it produces viruses 

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:05.160
 and must be removed. 

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:05.938
 and must be removed.
