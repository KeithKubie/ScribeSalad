00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.249
We've discussed two of the components so far. First, we had the affective

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:09.350
component, which was our feelings and emotions. And as we just saw with my

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:13.580
example of the red wings, we had the behavioral component. And this is a

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.250
tendency to act in a certain way toward something. Clearly, you could see how I

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.404
act towards the red wings. And the third component, of our attitudes, is the

00:00:22.404 --> 00:00:27.469
cognitive component. And this is our thoughts, beliefs, and ideas about

00:00:27.469 --> 00:00:31.975
something. Our attitudes can vary in terms of how heavily each component is

00:00:31.975 --> 00:00:37.327
weighed. That is, you may have a more cognitive component for some attitudes,

00:00:37.327 --> 00:00:42.836
for example, maybe the best way to make cheese fondue. It may be more heavily

00:00:42.836 --> 00:00:46.427
weighted from the cognitive component as opposed to something such as your

00:00:46.427 --> 00:00:52.588
attitude towards abortion, which may have a more affective component. Although

00:00:52.588 --> 00:00:56.004
most of our basic attitudes may be instinctive, we do know that some of our

00:00:56.004 --> 00:00:58.140
attitudes are learned.
