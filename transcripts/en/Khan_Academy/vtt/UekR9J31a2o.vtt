00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:03.810
I told you that the two most
important things you should

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.860
know in thermodynamics that will
get you most of your way

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.890
through most exams is that the
pressure times the volume is

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:14.440
equal to a constant, and that
the pressure times the volume

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.310
divided by the temperatures
is equal to a constant.

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.200
They all change such that the
initial pressure times the

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.490
volume divided by the initial
temperature is equal to the

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.520
final pressure times volume
divided by the final

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:27.830
temperature.

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:29.380
Assuming that you're not
changing the energy of the

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.060
system, and we'll do
more on that later.

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.240
The other thing you should
remember is that pressure

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.520
times volume is equal
to n, where n is

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.970
the number of moles.

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.930
Mole is a number like dozen, but
mole is a huge number-- 6

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.960
times 10 to the 23 times R.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:01:02.440
R was the universal gas
constant-- that's 8.31 joules

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.780
per mole Kelvin times
the temperature.

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.610
Remember, just to be safe,
always convert to Kelvin

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:12.440
first.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.430
Let's see if we can do a problem
that I can make up on

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.290
the fly of this situation.

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:24.170
Let's say I have a balloon, and
the volume of the balloon

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:32.650
is 1 meter cubed, so this
is a big balloon.

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.870
That's fairly large, if you
imagine a cubic meter.

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.420
The volume is a cubic meter, and
let's say the pressure is

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:50.240
equal to 5 pascals, and that's
newtons per meter squared.

00:01:53.105 --> 00:01:57.480
And let's say we're at a
reasonably warm temperature,

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:04.780
so temperature is equal to 20
degrees Celsius, and let's say

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.750
that balloon is filled helium.

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.170
My question to you is, how many
molecules of helium do I

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.490
have in the balloon?

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.180
Let's just substitute
into the equation.

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.150
We have pressure, which is 5--
and I'll actually write the

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.670
units, I never do it, but you
should, and you should always

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.460
do it on an exam-- 5
newtons per meter

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.550
squared times the volume.

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:34.330
1 meter cubed is equal to my
number of moles, n, times the

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:44.590
universal gas constant, 8.31
joules per mole Kelvin, times

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:45.610
temperature.

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.210
Remember, and I can't repeat
this enough, always convert

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:52.360
the temperature to Kelvin--
so whatever our Celsius

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.000
temperature is, add 273.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.540
Add 273 to that, and
you get 293 Kelvin.

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:04.720
So I get 5 times 1, and meters
square, meters cubed cancels

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:05.760
out and just becomes a meter.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.290
Newton meter is joules.

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.860
5 joules is equal to
n moles times 8.31

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.490
joules per mole Kelvin.

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:29.580
This Kelvin and this Kelvin
cancel out, so 8.31 times 293

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:45.235
is equal to 2,434.83
joules per mole.

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.380
To get to the number of moles,
we just divide both sides of

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:52.870
this equation by that.

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.570
And the units should work
out, so you get 5.

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:10.950
So n is equal to 5 joules
times 1 over 2,434.83.

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.740
Since we're dividing by this,
this flips; moles per joule.

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:17.740
This joule cancels out with this
joule, so we just have to

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:21.970
divide 5 by this, and we'll
get the number of moles.

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:27.680
Let's take the inverse of what
I had there times 5, and so I

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.552
get 0.002 moles.

00:04:32.552 --> 00:04:41.400
So this equals 0.0021 moles.

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.100
That might seem like a small
number to you, but let's

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.370
figure out how many
molecules that is.

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:54.150
Let me make some space free,
so I can write Avogadro's

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:55.400
number down.

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:08.720
Did I even say what Avogadro's
number is?

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.090
Avogadro's number is the number
of molecules per mole--

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:12.010
it's that number.

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:19.690
So, number Avogadro is equal
to 6.022 times 10 to the 23

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:24.040
molecules per mole.

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:25.870
The top is molecules, and the
bottom is moles-- I know you

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:27.390
can't read that.

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:31.970
I have 0.0021 moles, so how
many molecules do I have?

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:38.750
I just multiply that 0.0021
times how many moles per

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:45.580
molecule-- because this is
moles-- times Avogadro's

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:52.430
number, which is molecules
per mole.

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:54.910
That's molecules, this is
moles-- maybe I should write

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:59.530
the whole thing-- so then the
moles cancel out, and

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:08.070
Avogadro's number is 6.022 times
10 to the 23-- let's

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:09.900
just remember that--
and let's just

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:16.650
multiply that times 0.0021.

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:32.880
It equals 0.0126 times 10
to the 23 molecules.

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:36.240
This is 0.0126.

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:48.260
That's the same thing as 1.26
times 0.01, and then of course

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.740
times 10 to the 23.

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:51.710
What's 0.01?

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:56.320
That's 10 to the negative 2--
10 to the negative 1 is 0.1,

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:59.110
so this 10 to the negative 2.

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:04.410
Then we get 1.26-- 10 to the
negative 2, times 10 to the

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:09.760
negative 3, and we add the
exponents times 10 to the 21.

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:14.790
It's roughly 1.26, and then
another 19 zeroes-- or roughly

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:19.360
1 followed by 21 zeroes-- is how
many molecules of, in this

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:21.260
case, helium we had
in the balloon.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:22.230
It's not too difficult.

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:24.950
The hard part is really just
remembering Avogadro's number,

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:29.330
remembering the universal gas
constant is 8.31 joules per

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:32.920
mole Kelvin, remembering
to always convert your

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:35.300
temperature to Kelvin, and then
just making sure all your

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:36.390
units match up.

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:38.660
Sometimes that might be tricky:
they might give volume

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:41.660
in liters, and you have to--
especially in this case--

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:44.640
convert it to meters cubed
before you do it.

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:47.830
They might give pressure,
atmospheres, or bars, and you

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:50.980
should know the conversion, and
convert it to pascals or

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:52.040
newtons per meter squared.

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:54.600
Other than that, it's just
substituting and just doing

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:57.210
the hairy math and the
scientific notation.

00:07:57.210 --> 00:07:59.600
Hopefully, that was vaguely
clarifying.

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:01.400
See you in the next video.
