00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:05.170
FEMALE SPEAKER: Welcome to
Photographers at Google, a new

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:06.340
series that we're putting
together.

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:08.029
And we're really excited
to have Alan

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:09.090
Shapiro with us today.

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.170
He's from New York, visiting
us here at Mountain View at

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.320
Google headquarters, so it's
great to have you, Alan.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.260
He is the chief creative officer
at the world's largest

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.970
advertising network, and he's
worked on projects such as

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.740
M&amp;M, Mars, Heineken, and Dos
Equis, and Unilever.

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.970
He's award-winning photographer,
he's passionate

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.990
about photography, and he's
been published in private

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.770
collections and galleries, and
he has a real talent for

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.620
getting people to
open up to him.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.155
In fact, I got to witness
this just the

00:00:37.155 --> 00:00:38.950
other day at Chinatown.

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.810
He can get people to smile with
joy or sorrow, and at one

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:44.960
point, he had an old woman with
a cane about to hit him

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.780
over the head, but she was
smiling, so it's all good.

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.400
And his words reflect and
archive the moment that he

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.000
captures behind the camera.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.130
And so the topic today he
will be sharing is Dear

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.020
Photographers, Use Your Words.

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.920
And I'm pleased and excited to
have Alan Shapiro join us

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.170
today, so thank you.

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.460
ALAN SHAPIRO: That's it?

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:08.520
Come on.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.800
AUDIENCE: Confetti will be--

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:10.586
ALAN SHAPIRO: Later.

00:01:10.586 --> 00:01:11.082
Alright.

00:01:11.082 --> 00:01:12.332
You see?

00:01:16.538 --> 00:01:18.040
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.390
Wow, that's cool.

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:20.640
Crowd control.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.530
I'm actually really humbled and
feel incredibly privileged

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.000
to be here, so thank you Laurie,
and Brian, and all of

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.290
you for coming.

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.410
Google has literally
changed my life.

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:39.590
Google+ has changed my life,
but Google as an entity has

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:40.380
changed my life.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.120
And so for all of you, and all
of your peers, thank you.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.650
Because as a society, what I
call this Generation ADD,

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.810
we're jumping around way too
much, and that can be an

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.990
opportunity, but it can
also be a detriment.

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.790
And the technology that you've
created has brought us all

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.740
closer, has given way to umpteen
amounts of information

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.655
that we can share, and I think
it's a wonderful thing.

00:02:11.655 --> 00:02:12.810
But that's not what I'm
here to talk about.

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.380
So we're going up we're going
to erase this part.

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.670
I'm going to go back a little
bit, and I want to look at

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.290
that photo.

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.050
It was the first photo that,
as a young child--

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.500
by the way I've only been
photographing for about six,

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.530
seven years, but that photo
stuck with me throughout my

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.490
entire life.

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.920
And now, I want you to--
anyone know what the

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.820
background for that photo is?

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.230
Other than Karen.

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.460
Anyone know what was going on?

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.010
Isn't that a shame?

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.990
One of the most iconic,
brilliant people in the world

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.216
sticking his tongue out.

00:02:51.216 --> 00:02:53.220
So if you're a photographer,
what happened?

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.760
How did you do that?

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.780
If you're Einstein, what
made you do that?

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.260
And so, there's not a lot on the
internet other than being

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.410
able to find out that one of
the photographers, Arthur

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.220
Sasse, who worked for UPI
at the time, and it was

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.550
Einstein's 72nd birthday, and
he's tired of having all the

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.120
photographers take his picture,
so he stuck his

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.530
tongue out and it made for one
of the most iconic portraits

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.440
in modern times.

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.970
But now that's good, but
it's not good enough.

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.110
What was it like for Arthur?

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:26.815
Anyone have any idea?

00:03:26.815 --> 00:03:31.400
I'm a photographer, and I love
working with people, and if I

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.940
had the opportunity to get in
front of an Einstein, or Larry

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.326
Page, or Sergey, or whoever I
happen to find here, what

00:03:39.326 --> 00:03:40.260
would I do?

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:40.750
What would I think?

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.990
How would I feel?

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:45.960
And so, I think there's a
huge lost opportunity.

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.390
So let me go to another one.

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.440
Anybody know anything
about this photo?

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.780
Another iconic photo in our
modern day history, Dorothea

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.930
Lange, photographing during
the Depression in the

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.310
vegetable fields here
in California.

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.460
What went on?

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:10.510
So, you can find a little
bit of information.

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.720
The thing that speaks to me--
and I want to read this to

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.380
you, because it's the genesis
of this talk--

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.829
I saw and approached the hungry,
desperate mother as if

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:20.370
drawn by a magnet.

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:21.930
And I want you thinking
about Dorothea now.

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.735
You probably know nothing
about her.

00:04:23.735 --> 00:04:26.680
There aren't that many recorded
interviews with her,

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.290
but as you listen to the
words, think about the

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:32.200
photographer and how that makes
you feel about her, and

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.410
that becomes a branding
opportunity.

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.850
I don't remember how to explain
my presence or my

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:38.770
camera to her, but
I do remember

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.040
she asked me no questions.

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:44.490
I can't imagine that moment.

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.600
I made five exposures, working
closer and closer from the

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:47.260
same direction.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:48.830
I didn't ask her name
or her history.

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:52.170
She told me her age, that she
was 32, that she had been

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:54.960
living on frozen vegetables from
the surrounding fields

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.300
and the birds that her
children killed.

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.050
That she had just sold
the tires from her

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.620
car to pay for food.

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.370
Then she sat in the lean-to tent
with her children, and

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:09.040
somehow thought that her
picture, Dorothea's picture,

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.372
might help.

00:05:11.372 --> 00:05:14.250
How do you feel about the
photographer now?

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.670
Do you like Dorothea?

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:18.170
Do you like the mom?

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:19.420
Do you know enough?

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:26.400
So most people here, I hope,
are photographers.

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.680
Even if you think you're a
photographer, or don't think

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.190
you're a photographer, you've
got a device that will let you

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:32.960
take a picture.

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.240
So we're all photographers.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.780
Welcome to the club.

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:37.560
Some of us are a little more
passionate, a little bit more

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:40.670
involved, make a little bit more
money, but we all have

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:45.120
this opportunity to document
society, and that's a

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.140
wonderful thing.

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:50.250
There has never been a better
time to put pictures up, to

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:55.580
share them, to see the world in
its infinitesimally small

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:58.230
bits, because of photographers
around the world.

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:02.490
Again, thank you, Google+ for
bringing that to my life.

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:04.720
But now, there's a
lot of laziness

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:05.920
that accompanies that.

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:07.760
You take a picture, you post it,
you take another picture,

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:08.500
and you post it.

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:10.000
If you're a family photographer,
you pick thirty

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.160
pictures and you post it,
and then that's it.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.650
Now there are some people, I
don't mean to overgeneralize,

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:21.100
who do write, and I love you.

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:24.240
I love you.

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.600
And I love the people who will
provide the context, because

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:29.240
that's what this is about.

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.470
Now the reaction--

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:33.910
so here's the reaction
to use your words.

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:36.040
Some people will shout loudly.

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:39.170
Sorry I had to get this in,
Brian, you know that.

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:45.230
But most often, when I teach, I
get this look, or this look,

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:47.865
sometimes this look, and
usually this look.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.500
The story that goes with this,
this is my 100-year-old

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:56.360
grandmother, who passed away
just a few months ago, after

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:58.950
turning 100.

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:02.045
A few years back, my two
children and I were visiting,

00:07:02.045 --> 00:07:04.550
and I was taking thousands of
pictures, and she was getting

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:08.080
annoyed, because at the time,
she was 97 or 98, and the

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:10.100
camera clicking, you
get annoyed.

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:12.120
She said, please stop.

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:14.090
And I wouldn't, because
I couldn't.

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:16.950
She's my grandmother.

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:20.960
And the kids whispered in her
ear, give him the finger.

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:24.520
And she didn't know what that
meant, so she did this to me.

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:27.830
And then she did this,
and then, someone--

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:28.460
my daughter--

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:33.270
whispered in her other ear, no,
it's the middle finger.

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:34.140
And so she did it.

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:36.680
She did it, and there's
that photo.

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:38.760
And she said, but what
does it mean?

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:40.910
She had no idea what it meant.

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:44.110
And so my son whispered in her
ear, and she said, why would I

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:46.510
do that to my grandson?

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:47.960
I adore him.

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:49.430
And my daughter said, well,
people do it to him in New

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:50.680
York all the time.

00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:57.420
So before you heard that story,
which is one of my

00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:59.675
favorite stories about one of my
most favorite people, and I

00:07:59.675 --> 00:08:02.340
have shared it, and it has
gone around the world.

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:04.260
And this is now in the
collection of a very large

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:05.040
insurance company.

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:07.380
It sits in one of their hidden
hallways that they only show

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:12.050
special people, because
it is what it is.

00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:13.640
But now, does that make
a difference to you?

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:16.212
Does that help a little bit?

00:08:16.212 --> 00:08:20.490
Do you feel a little bit
different about Bubby or Alan?

00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:24.030
So what's the difference
that words make?

00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:25.840
Now, I'm going to talk,
and this isn't

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:26.322
going to be a lecture.

00:08:26.322 --> 00:08:27.540
I'm going to show you a lot of
pictures, and I'm going to

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:29.660
tell you a lot of stories, but I
want you to think about just

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:31.020
the four things.

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:36.090
One, we're able to document
everything now, thanks to

00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:39.750
cameras, thanks to Google Maps,
thanks to all of the

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:43.280
technology that allows us to
capture all of these things,

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:44.490
and that's important.

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:46.700
But now we want to go
beyond metadata.

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:49.860
So what are the happenings that
are going on, and what

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:54.090
can we do to add a little bit
more context to that?

00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:58.490
Now, I'm a portrait photographer
sometimes.

00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:00.980
So sometimes it's about
making connections.

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:02.970
Because when I approach someone,
I'm not one of those

00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:06.060
stealthy guys, I'm going
to come up here, see?

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:07.630
And I'm going to
make you smile.

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:09.486
And I'll bet I could
make you cry.

00:09:09.486 --> 00:09:11.770
AUDIENCE: Probably.

00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:13.550
ALAN SHAPIRO: And that's where
the connections, the using

00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:16.440
your words as a photographer,
is equally important.

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:20.530
It's not just after the fact,
it's before the fact.

00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:23.400
Education.

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:26.970
I think this is the single
most important thing that

00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:30.000
photographers should do, and I
can tell you, having worked

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.430
with some very iconic
photographers, it's the last

00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:35.880
thing they want to do, because
everyone has secrets.

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:38.120
I don't want to share
my secrets.

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:40.340
Sorry.

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:41.600
I don't want to share
my secrets.

00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:46.990
And to those people, I would
say, you have to share your

00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:48.480
secrets, because that's going
to make you a better

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:50.320
photographer.

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:53.373
Because as soon as people know
how you do what you do, it's

00:09:53.373 --> 00:09:56.700
going to force you to
do something else.

00:09:56.700 --> 00:10:00.110
So instead of getting stuck
in a rut, teach.

00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:03.430
And by the way, I'm a huge fan
of causes, and I think teacher

00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:06.790
should be paid like rock stars
and athletes, and athletes and

00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:09.120
rock stars should be forced to
teach, but that's a whole

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:11.530
other talk.

00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:13.750
So let's talk about, sort
of, beginnings.

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:17.490
I think every photographer,
whether you're a starving

00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:20.820
college kid, or middle
aged guy who picks it

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:23.280
up to reduce stress--

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:25.240
and by the way, that's
exactly what I did.

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:27.200
I work in advertising, I've
spent lots of time with

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:29.710
photographers, I was sort of
jealous of them because they

00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:30.890
seem to have a lot
of fun working

00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:32.890
with models and whatever.

00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:36.220
But I also got very stressed,
and a photographer friend of

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:38.770
mine put a camera in my hand,
and I immediately got too

00:10:38.770 --> 00:10:40.830
happy place.

00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:45.470
But as a storyteller in my day
job, as someone who create

00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:49.820
stories around brands, the idea
of seeing what stories

00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:54.250
emerge from my photographs, what
could I do with them that

00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:58.730
either illustrate, enhance,
complement, provide context?

00:10:58.730 --> 00:11:00.330
That became important to me.

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:02.560
And it became a daily
exercise regimen.

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:04.310
You really are passing that
around, aren't you?

00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:05.262
Cool.

00:11:05.262 --> 00:11:06.700
Good, OK.

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:09.730
Just worried about the guy
in the white hair.

00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:11.110
Don't know that I trust him.

00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:13.860
So like most New Yorkers,
there's a huge homeless

00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:15.170
population.

00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:18.160
Which, to me, is absolutely a
horrible thing, as I'm sure

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:18.970
this to a lot of people.

00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:20.320
No one likes it.

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:23.810
And so we started
spending time.

00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:26.290
But this was a bad photograph
for me, because I couldn't

00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:27.650
talk to this person.

00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:29.500
You know I later went back,
and I got to know Jason,

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:32.230
because homeless people
have a territory, and

00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:34.590
I got to know him.

00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:37.330
This is one of my favorite
stories, and this is something

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:40.090
that I may get mushy about.

00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:44.990
This is a gentleman named Boris,
and he is easily the

00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:48.960
scariest person I've ever met
when he is off his meds.

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:52.390
And he's rarely medicated, and
when he has medicine, people

00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:54.335
steal it from the shelters.

00:11:54.335 --> 00:11:56.860
He's horribly scary.

00:11:56.860 --> 00:12:04.410
But as is my thing, I would
walk by, and I would leave

00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:08.160
lunch bags, breakfast
food, whatever.

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:11.990
And they never talk to me, and
I really kept my distance.

00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:17.020
But then one day, he said,
hey, camera guy.

00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:19.430
And I stopped.

00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:21.210
And he said, come here.

00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:24.626
And I got very scared,
but I did.

00:12:24.626 --> 00:12:25.876
Because I'm cautious.

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:30.300
And he said, would you
take my picture?

00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:31.470
I said, why?

00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:33.850
I said, I would love to take
your picture, but why?

00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:36.180
He said, well, I've got a
granddaughter, and she I

00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:38.275
haven't seen her in several
years, and want

00:12:38.275 --> 00:12:41.370
her to know I'm OK.

00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:44.740
So I got really honored,
and we took pictures.

00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:48.480
And then the next day, I came
back, and I brought my laptop,

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:51.050
and I had all the pictures I
took, because I took it easily

00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:57.650
100, and I would have taken
1,000 but he got tired.

00:12:57.650 --> 00:13:01.830
And we sent the pictures, and
we edited them together.

00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:04.760
We sent them off, and then a few
weeks later, he came and

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:08.630
he had a letter back from her.

00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:09.570
And it was magnificent.

00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:12.440
And then he gave me this big
stinky hug, with clothes that

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:15.540
hadn't been washed in probably
a year or two.

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:17.720
And we--

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:20.820
one of the most amazing
moments of my life.

00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:21.960
Now, I'm telling you
stories now.

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:25.480
I've obviously written these
things down, but it's

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:26.010
important to me.

00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:29.000
It's important to me to share
because I want you to know

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.890
that things like homelessness
are things that we need to not

00:13:33.890 --> 00:13:38.460
allow, we need to raise
our voices on.

00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:41.590
But also because as human beings
to human beings, making

00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:46.550
those connections, making his
day just by doing something by

00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:49.170
talking to him, by noticing him,
is something that's very

00:13:49.170 --> 00:13:51.850
important to me.

00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:55.350
So here we are in Chinatown
with Richard.

00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:58.100
And long story short, I went
in and I bought four Peking

00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:03.080
ducks and a couple of racks of
ribs, and we sat and we just

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:04.260
took stuff.

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:05.655
But I saw this--

00:14:05.655 --> 00:14:09.990
it looks much better on my
screen, by the way--

00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:12.190
and I had to talk to him, and I
had to find out what's going

00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:13.710
on, and I had to share it.

00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:15.090
And then I started playing
a little bit.

00:14:15.090 --> 00:14:18.800
So this is from an ongoing
series called Fallen, because

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:23.430
in my mind, what if these
people roaming among us,

00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:26.180
homeless, what if they really
were the angels

00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:27.430
put down upon us?

00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:33.970
This is Scottie, he's from a
little bit further south, and

00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:37.410
I think the post on
this was start by

00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:41.240
covering left hand side.

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:43.260
Sorry, I'm a little backwards.

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:47.960
Start by covering that,
and look at that man.

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:50.550
He's got three children, he's
had three companies that he

00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:53.170
was CEO of.

00:14:53.170 --> 00:14:58.190
Had a big car, had a boat, was
happily married, and then he

00:14:58.190 --> 00:15:00.040
started drinking.

00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:02.950
Now cover that and
look at this guy.

00:15:02.950 --> 00:15:05.420
And now he's lost everything.

00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:08.020
And depending on when you see
these people, you're going to

00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:11.040
see a different aspect
of them.

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:16.140
I was fortunate in that on
this day, I saw both.

00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:17.790
Because I came back
later in the day.

00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:20.100
Because that was my morning
shot, and then that was the

00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:21.350
afternoon shot.

00:15:23.830 --> 00:15:26.540
This is a guy named Russell.

00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:30.240
Harriet, who sang me a beautiful
song, and I wish I'd

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:32.610
had my video recorder, because
I wanted to take the lyrics

00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:36.490
down, because it was about a
brown eyed guy from New York,

00:15:36.490 --> 00:15:38.890
and it just went on and on,
and it was magnificent.

00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:44.280
And then that led me to starting
a project with a guy

00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:47.020
named Mike Shaw, who is another
kindred spirit of

00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:51.800
mine, who lives in the UK, where
we talked about the need

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:55.220
to spend time with people and
connect with people and use

00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:56.560
our words with people.

00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:03.300
And then that led to a statement
that I've had

00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:05.770
written down for years, and
I've made a campaign--

00:16:05.770 --> 00:16:09.075
because as a photographer and as
an advertising guy, I have

00:16:09.075 --> 00:16:13.180
the ability to put messages
out there, at least in my

00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:15.840
social networks, but
also in media--

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:19.670
about don't spare change,
make change.

00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:21.470
That led me to veterans.

00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:23.490
This is also a guy named
Richard, and

00:16:23.490 --> 00:16:26.120
this is what I saw.

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:33.210
He's a World War II vet, and
he's bitter, and as we talked

00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:40.340
about things, we got him to
open up and smile, and see

00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:41.590
that there were possibilities.

00:16:44.050 --> 00:16:45.300
And this is where I left him.

00:16:48.030 --> 00:16:53.450
Now, homelessness and veterans
married for me in this world.

00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:55.910
This is on Veterans
Day, and this is a

00:16:55.910 --> 00:17:00.320
homeless guy named Stefan.

00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:06.310
And the fact here is that one in
four veterans are homeless

00:17:06.310 --> 00:17:09.990
in this country, are homeless
at some point coming back.

00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:14.609
So don't spare change, make
change, and meeting veterans,

00:17:14.609 --> 00:17:17.560
it took me to all
sorts of places.

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:20.400
And so the connections that you
make, the people that you

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:22.800
meet the stories of theirs
that you can share.

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:26.050
By the way, every single one of
them, of these people, have

00:17:26.050 --> 00:17:29.410
allowed me to tell their
stories, because I do ask.

00:17:29.410 --> 00:17:31.240
I think that's critically
important in street

00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:33.010
photography for me.

00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:36.570
Whenever I'm going to add a
story to an image, I have to

00:17:36.570 --> 00:17:38.530
get permission.

00:17:38.530 --> 00:17:39.700
Did I get your permission,
Brian?

00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:41.120
I know I--

00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:41.530
sort of.

00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:44.180
OK.

00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:47.340
So this led to a whole series of
veterans, and I'm not going

00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:49.100
to take you through all
of that just in

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:50.920
the interest of time.

00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:52.730
But here's another story that
I want to tell you.

00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:54.900
It's Veterans Day.

00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:57.210
Not a great shot, but there are
thousands and thousands of

00:17:57.210 --> 00:18:00.120
photographers accompanying the
tens of thousands of veterans

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:02.320
in New York.

00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:04.850
And someone brought an eagle,
because it's our simple of

00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:06.500
patriotism.

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:08.970
And the eagle is sitting
proudly, and he's looking, and

00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:12.660
you have the beautiful soldiers
behind, and everyone

00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:14.770
was photographing, and it
was a sea of shutters.

00:18:14.770 --> 00:18:17.070
I mean, it was like listening to
the ocean over rocks, there

00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:20.490
were that many shutters going
constantly, and so the sound,

00:18:20.490 --> 00:18:24.720
the sonic branding that was
going on was incredible.

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:26.780
But then the eagle looked down
for a second, and it got

00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:29.300
deathly quiet.

00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:31.890
Except for me, because I had
to keep clicking, because

00:18:31.890 --> 00:18:32.710
there was a moment that I saw.

00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:35.270
But it was odd to me, that among
all these photographers,

00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:37.940
you would think that everyone
would just keep shooting, but

00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:38.460
nobody did.

00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:44.690
And so I recall the silence, and
that silence combined with

00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:48.960
the image for me, on Veterans
Day, where we're remembering

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:51.950
our fallen, is incredibly
powerful.

00:18:51.950 --> 00:18:54.130
But you would never know that if
you saw this image without

00:18:54.130 --> 00:18:57.080
the story, without the
words, would you?

00:18:57.080 --> 00:19:02.350
Nor would you know how much I
care, how deeply important

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:03.860
this is to me.

00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:07.270
So I want you all to think about
that as you're taking

00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:08.400
your pictures.

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:10.272
What's important to you?

00:19:10.272 --> 00:19:13.660
And are you telling as much
of a story as you want to?

00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:15.110
So there's the first thing
to put out there.

00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:20.460
This is a guy named
Rocco Moretto.

00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:22.650
He's a World War II vet,
three Purple Hearts.

00:19:22.650 --> 00:19:25.950
His platoon landed on
Omaha Beach during

00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:27.690
the Battle of Normandy.

00:19:27.690 --> 00:19:31.790
He was one of two survivors
of his original platoon.

00:19:31.790 --> 00:19:33.480
Two.

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:37.510
I met him on Veterans Day, and
I got to meet him and get to

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:41.850
know him, and his girlfriend
Margie, who was a World War II

00:19:41.850 --> 00:19:44.370
woman's Army Corps person.

00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:46.070
Didn't realize they were
boyfriend and girlfriend til

00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:48.710
just a few months ago, but they
were always together.

00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:52.580
And so you see these two
90-year-old World War II vets,

00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:56.170
and it's a magnificent thing.

00:19:56.170 --> 00:19:59.040
And Lockheed Martin called
me a few months ago and

00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:02.230
commissioned me to do a series
on veterans as a result of my

00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:04.840
passion for this.

00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:07.100
And so, that was a big
honor, but then--

00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:11.050
and Rocco was one of the first
people I asked to shoot.

00:20:11.050 --> 00:20:13.330
And we got to know each
other better.

00:20:13.330 --> 00:20:16.090
And then a few days after that,
he called me, and he was

00:20:16.090 --> 00:20:18.930
calling me like 40 times a day
leading up to the shoot.

00:20:18.930 --> 00:20:20.655
Are we still on, are we still
on, where are we meeting, what

00:20:20.655 --> 00:20:21.550
should I bring, what
should I wear?

00:20:21.550 --> 00:20:23.060
It was great.

00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:25.090
Because if you remember, a
few months ago, I lost my

00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:26.080
grandmother.

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:28.246
But I found a grandfather.

00:20:28.246 --> 00:20:33.210
A magnificent, heroic, tiny
little grandfather who loves

00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:38.100
cannolis, and pasta, and
just listening to

00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:40.830
stories about my children.

00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:43.480
And he called me, and
he said, the VFW--

00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:46.870
Veterans of Foreign Wars Hall
in Queens, that he was a

00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:47.920
member of--

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:50.160
was being renamed after
himself, and

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:53.090
would I be his guest?

00:20:53.090 --> 00:20:53.870
So I went.

00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:54.570
Right?

00:20:54.570 --> 00:20:55.906
Right, this--

00:20:55.906 --> 00:20:58.140
I know.

00:20:58.140 --> 00:20:59.050
Right?

00:20:59.050 --> 00:20:59.916
AUDIENCE: Keep going.

00:20:59.916 --> 00:21:01.650
[INAUDIBLE].

00:21:01.650 --> 00:21:03.510
ALAN SHAPIRO: And so, what you
can't see are the hundreds of

00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:05.630
people behind Rocco.

00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:07.810
But at some point after the
outside ceremony, where we had

00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:10.040
congressman and senators and all
of these people, because

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:10.860
he's a big deal.

00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:14.490
There aren't that many World
War II vets left.

00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:19.230
This wonderful singer started
singing Andrews Sisters songs

00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:23.380
and crooning to him, and
everyone was behind me, and

00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:24.635
that's what I saw.

00:21:24.635 --> 00:21:27.180
And it was dark, and I didn't
have a flash, and didn't even

00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:29.530
want to bring a flash because
that would be disrespectful.

00:21:29.530 --> 00:21:32.850
I didn't want to interrupt
what was going on.

00:21:32.850 --> 00:21:37.450
And so it's what I think is a
crappy photo, but for me, it

00:21:37.450 --> 00:21:42.490
is incredibly iconic, and it
speaks to me just like the

00:21:42.490 --> 00:21:45.190
"Life" magazines and "Look"
magazines that I used to look

00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:50.570
at it as a kid, and I see
that same thing in it.

00:21:50.570 --> 00:21:51.840
And that makes me proud,
because it

00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:53.730
means I'm getting somewhere.

00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:56.120
That I'm seeing things
differently.

00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:57.590
But more importantly is
that I was there to

00:21:57.590 --> 00:21:59.790
share it with him.

00:21:59.790 --> 00:22:01.360
And that's what I want
you to know about me.

00:22:04.670 --> 00:22:07.690
When I meet people like Francis,
the first thing he

00:22:07.690 --> 00:22:13.070
told me is he just came out of
a coma six months ago, and he

00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:15.990
was immediately taken to jail.

00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:17.640
And he just got out.

00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:19.740
And he wouldn't tell me why he
was in jail, or why he was in

00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:20.990
the coma, but they
were related.

00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:26.300
And don't call me Fran, or
Frank, or anything, you have

00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:27.160
to call me Francis.

00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:31.490
Which immediately, I laughed,
and so he gave me that look.

00:22:31.490 --> 00:22:34.230
And I said, oh shit, oh drat.

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:40.790
And that's the photo.

00:22:40.790 --> 00:22:43.180
And there was a lot more to it,
and now he invites me to

00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:47.520
his mixed martial arts meets,
where he gets to beat up

00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:50.330
people who are even meaner
looking than him.

00:22:50.330 --> 00:22:51.580
These are his hands,
by the way.

00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:58.430
This is a Houston
Street Romeo.

00:22:58.430 --> 00:23:00.480
Brian knows Houston Street.

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:04.260
He was cruising uptown chicks.

00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:06.340
I just walked over and
I said, I need your

00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:07.720
hat, can I have it?

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:08.590
Can I buy it?

00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:11.390
And he said, no, because
it is made for my head.

00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:14.010
And we had this ongoing
conversation, and you know

00:23:14.010 --> 00:23:17.370
that hat, I mean, he spent at
least 20 minutes putting his

00:23:17.370 --> 00:23:19.430
hat on at exactly
the right angle.

00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:22.981
You knew that, and practicing
his smile at home.

00:23:22.981 --> 00:23:25.430
Well, at least I hope you know
from looking at the picture,

00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:27.830
but if you didn't know that from
looking at the picture,

00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:31.710
now you know it, because
it's written down.

00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:34.770
Again, I don't mean to beat a
point into the ground, beat a

00:23:34.770 --> 00:23:37.080
dead horse.

00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:38.580
This kid had never
heard of Steven

00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:40.520
Spielberg or "The Goonies".

00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:43.460
So I pulled out my phone, and
I pulled up a YouTube clip,

00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:46.410
and I said, oh my god, when they
do the modern day remake,

00:23:46.410 --> 00:23:50.460
I'm calling Steve, you're
first in line.

00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:52.990
That was the look I got when I
told them that I could call

00:23:52.990 --> 00:23:54.240
Steven Spielberg.

00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:03.130
The ugliest girl in your grade
has a crush on you.

00:24:03.130 --> 00:24:04.380
Go.

00:24:07.910 --> 00:24:10.110
Because sometimes when you
find the right people to

00:24:10.110 --> 00:24:11.820
connect with, to talk to--

00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:15.590
this happens to be my daughter's
friend, Will--

00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:17.910
it's amazing the expressions
you get.

00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:19.650
You just have to be prepared
to make that connection.

00:24:19.650 --> 00:24:20.640
And it doesn't always work.

00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:23.050
I mean, you have to be a good
gauge of character in order to

00:24:23.050 --> 00:24:25.790
know what you can do with some
people, where you can just

00:24:25.790 --> 00:24:28.420
offer up generic questions
and get wonderful

00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:31.740
answers, visual answers.

00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:34.420
We were talking about tomatoes,
and heirloom

00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:40.080
tomatoes in particular, and
salsa recipes in its absolute

00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:41.860
particular thing.

00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:43.275
And I told him that
I hated salsa.

00:24:46.650 --> 00:24:49.360
Mind you, the conversation about
salsa went on for 15

00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:51.350
minutes before I finally
dropped that bomb.

00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:53.800
It's like, I just don't like
it, I don't get it.

00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:55.050
Click.

00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:03.910
This woman recently arrived
from the Middle East--

00:25:03.910 --> 00:25:06.130
I don't recall the country,
it's somewhere

00:25:06.130 --> 00:25:09.160
on one of my writings--

00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:12.490
where her husband beat her,
after her father had beaten

00:25:12.490 --> 00:25:16.070
her, after her grandfather had
beaten her mother, and so on,

00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:17.610
and so forth.

00:25:17.610 --> 00:25:21.250
And so she came to this
country to be free.

00:25:21.250 --> 00:25:25.140
So sad eyed girl without a
little bit of the back story.

00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:28.440
And I could go on with
the backstory.

00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:32.750
This gentleman wanted
to be a waiter.

00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:34.320
Can you imagine him coming
up and saying,

00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:35.370
can I take your order?

00:25:35.370 --> 00:25:39.930
I met him on the street, and
that was the look I got, and

00:25:39.930 --> 00:25:40.790
it just went on from there.

00:25:40.790 --> 00:25:41.810
I think there's another one.

00:25:41.810 --> 00:25:45.740
I said, well, OK, so let's see,
I order ketchup with my

00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:47.800
foie gras, what's the face
you're going to make?

00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:51.740
And we've got to that.

00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:56.450
Here's a World War II veteran,
but from the other side.

00:25:56.450 --> 00:26:00.400
And his family came
from Hiroshima.

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:02.100
And so we were talking
about that.

00:26:04.930 --> 00:26:07.810
And this is a little girl, and
I said, can you imagine if I

00:26:07.810 --> 00:26:10.120
went into your room and
tore all the heads

00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:11.370
off your teddy bears?

00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:16.950
That's the look I got.

00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:20.080
And I said, OK, you win.

00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:24.300
Because clearly she was going
to rip my head off.

00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:29.650
This is the nation's most
famous boylesque dancer.

00:26:29.650 --> 00:26:31.470
I think he goes by the
name of Tigger.

00:26:31.470 --> 00:26:34.120
I don't know if he still goes
by the name of Tigger.

00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:36.740
Doing his best Al Jolson
at the Mermaid

00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:39.250
Parade in Coney Island.

00:26:39.250 --> 00:26:40.260
And a starving artist.

00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:42.400
I'm going to go through.

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:45.610
But what started to happen to
me is, as part of my daily

00:26:45.610 --> 00:26:48.490
exercise, I started thinking
about another day.

00:26:48.490 --> 00:26:51.160
And that's the genesis of the
"Another Day, Another 600

00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:53.080
Seconds" that Mike and I did.

00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:54.660
Spend 10 minutes with people.

00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:56.550
See the difference it makes.

00:26:56.550 --> 00:27:00.070
But here another day, another
10 round fight with the

00:27:00.070 --> 00:27:02.700
checkbook, dealing with the
mortgage, car payments, two

00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:07.670
college tuitions, and far too
many other assorted monthly

00:27:07.670 --> 00:27:10.140
bills that aren't going to pay
themselves while dreaming of

00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:11.390
being a Bruce Willis
understudy.

00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:16.480
So it becomes a little
bit of a creative

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:17.550
writing exercise, sometimes.

00:27:17.550 --> 00:27:19.350
Because I know what's going
on, but I'm looking for

00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:21.760
something that will
complement it.

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:23.630
And here, another day, another
few dollars closer to bringing

00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:26.160
his family to America, where his
granddaughters can expect

00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:28.880
to receive an education,
rather than beatings.

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:31.040
Social commentary.

00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:34.460
It can be important, and when
you have a platform like

00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:38.830
Google+, why not use it?

00:27:38.830 --> 00:27:41.370
Now, I'm not looking to pick
fights, and I'm not looking to

00:27:41.370 --> 00:27:44.130
stand on a soapbox, but things
that are important to

00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:46.930
me help define me.

00:27:46.930 --> 00:27:51.160
And if I can't bring attention
to them, who can?

00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:56.320
So maybe we all have obligations
to talk about

00:27:56.320 --> 00:28:00.130
stuff that people aren't
talking enough about.

00:28:00.130 --> 00:28:02.990
And yeah, people can unblock me,
and uncheck me, and mute

00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:05.680
me, and do whatever, but what
is the obligation of a

00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:06.810
photographer?

00:28:06.810 --> 00:28:09.900
What is the obligation
of a human being?

00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:12.060
Rhetorical question, because I
don't really have the answer,

00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:13.670
and I don't want to
take it too far.

00:28:13.670 --> 00:28:15.180
But that context
and all of that

00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:16.430
stuff is really important.

00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:20.430
Connections.

00:28:20.430 --> 00:28:24.020
Making connections
using your words.

00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:28.010
When you have a 14-year-old son,
using your words is an

00:28:28.010 --> 00:28:29.550
interesting thing.

00:28:29.550 --> 00:28:32.720
But I can tell you that when I
asked Drew if he would pose

00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:35.940
for me with an octopus--

00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:37.340
that was the first
conversation--

00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:40.410
I got the biggest smile
I'd seen ever.

00:28:40.410 --> 00:28:43.770
And when I was doing the shoot
with him, and I pulled this

00:28:43.770 --> 00:28:47.380
octopus out of milk-- because
that's the only way you can

00:28:47.380 --> 00:28:51.130
somewhat get rid
of the smell--

00:28:51.130 --> 00:28:55.050
and put it on his head, and
watched him gag and retch.

00:28:55.050 --> 00:28:58.220
And I thought, as a father,
this is the most defining

00:28:58.220 --> 00:29:00.150
moment ever.

00:29:00.150 --> 00:29:04.220
It is perfection
times infinity.

00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:06.890
And then he started laughing
and smiling.

00:29:06.890 --> 00:29:09.800
And so, for that afternoon
that we were shooting--

00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:10.730
because I wouldn't
let them go.

00:29:10.730 --> 00:29:12.910
This was not going to be a 10
minute shoot, this was going

00:29:12.910 --> 00:29:16.870
to be as long a shoot as
I had memory cards for.

00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:18.720
Payback for everything, Drew.

00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:26.010
One of the best photographic
experiences of my life.

00:29:26.010 --> 00:29:31.640
But as a proud father, and as a
teacher, I want you to think

00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:32.870
about those opportunities.

00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:34.660
Because I know lots of people
who say, I can't approach

00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:35.340
people on the street.

00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:36.560
I'm scared of them.

00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:39.130
Well then, do something fun with
your kids, or your wife,

00:29:39.130 --> 00:29:42.100
or your husband.

00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:43.830
So this is my daughter, Lindsay,
because I had to get

00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:45.940
her into the picture, too.

00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:47.900
This is a little bit later.

00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:49.480
I have hissing cockroaches from

00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:50.990
Madagascar in my home office.

00:29:50.990 --> 00:29:53.660
I don't know why, my daughter
wanted them because she's like

00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:56.650
a nature freak, next Jane
Goodall, hi Lindsay.

00:29:56.650 --> 00:30:00.940
And then she got tired
of them, so they

00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:02.970
ended up with me.

00:30:02.970 --> 00:30:06.400
And they really are awesome
creatures, and they're like

00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:10.720
this big, and she was jealous
of the octopus

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:13.180
shoot, so we did this.

00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:16.440
Because it's like, how do you
top sort of a live, fresh

00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:17.390
octopus on your head?

00:30:17.390 --> 00:30:19.300
Well let's go with the
hissing cockroaches.

00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:22.532
We'll see how tough you are for
your next trip to Borneo.

00:30:22.532 --> 00:30:24.570
And I added textures and things
like that, because I

00:30:24.570 --> 00:30:27.120
was playing as a creative guy.

00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:29.460
Again, another incredible
opportunity.

00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:32.130
So for the parents out there
who want to do stuff with

00:30:32.130 --> 00:30:34.890
photography, try one
of these exercises.

00:30:34.890 --> 00:30:36.470
Think of the grossest thing
you could do to your

00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:40.120
kids, and beg them.

00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:40.590
And guess what?

00:30:40.590 --> 00:30:43.320
You may not have to beg them.

00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:45.410
And here's a follow up shot,
because we wanted, again, I

00:30:45.410 --> 00:30:46.380
have to stretch it out.

00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:47.630
Because it's torture,
it's payback.

00:30:47.630 --> 00:30:48.430
It's all those things.

00:30:48.430 --> 00:30:50.320
Because we all know, 14-year-old
kids are pure

00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:52.380
evil, and when she walks into
the room, she levitates and

00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:54.210
all the doors in the
house close, and

00:30:54.210 --> 00:30:56.630
it gets really cold.

00:30:56.630 --> 00:30:57.450
That's just the way it is.

00:30:57.450 --> 00:30:58.990
And then she smiles and
says, hi Daddy,

00:30:58.990 --> 00:31:00.310
and it all goes back.

00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:05.980
Where was this taken?

00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:08.390
Beautiful silverback gorilla.

00:31:08.390 --> 00:31:12.340
Rare, rare to have eye contact,
if you're believe the

00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:13.590
National Geographic
photographers.

00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:17.350
Anybody?

00:31:17.350 --> 00:31:18.820
AUDIENCE: Bronx Zoo?

00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:20.136
ALAN SHAPIRO: Right.

00:31:20.136 --> 00:31:22.600
Bronx Zoo.

00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:25.490
But it could've been Uganda.

00:31:25.490 --> 00:31:27.740
So does that matter?

00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:30.070
Probably not.

00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:36.150
But when you start thinking
about images like this, is he

00:31:36.150 --> 00:31:37.400
on the outside or the inside?

00:31:39.780 --> 00:31:42.930
And maybe, just maybe, for those
photographers who don't

00:31:42.930 --> 00:31:48.430
write, maybe adding a little
bit of context will help.

00:31:48.430 --> 00:31:49.750
Either tell the story
you want to tell.

00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:52.710
Because this obviously--

00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:54.390
obviously, in quotes--

00:31:54.390 --> 00:32:01.860
is a gelada, cousin to a baboon,
who's inside, who's

00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:04.330
trapped, who's sad.

00:32:04.330 --> 00:32:06.750
But I can tell you, because I
was there taking this picture,

00:32:06.750 --> 00:32:09.070
that this was the happiest
gelada ever, and he was

00:32:09.070 --> 00:32:11.900
outside because, I was inside.

00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:13.710
And he just was so curious
with the people

00:32:13.710 --> 00:32:15.460
coming by with whatever--

00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:18.860
his keepers, his handlers, his
photographers like me, who had

00:32:18.860 --> 00:32:20.740
the privilege of going
right up there--

00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:22.480
that he would come and he would
sit with his feet up,

00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:23.015
and he would watch.

00:32:23.015 --> 00:32:26.650
And I swear, if I put a can of
popcorn there, he would have

00:32:26.650 --> 00:32:28.770
had it in his hand, with the
exact same look and popped it

00:32:28.770 --> 00:32:30.820
in his mouth.

00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:33.830
He was so happy.

00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:36.540
But you'd never know it.

00:32:36.540 --> 00:32:37.500
So it's my decision.

00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:39.810
Do I share the story or not?

00:32:39.810 --> 00:32:41.780
Because I can use it
in one of two ways.

00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:43.680
Use your powers for
good or for evil.

00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:44.460
You choose.

00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:47.020
But if you're not doing
something, if you're not

00:32:47.020 --> 00:32:51.110
adding those words, you're
just being irresponsible.

00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:52.510
God, that was a strong word.

00:32:52.510 --> 00:32:53.680
You're being lazy.

00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:55.130
Another strong word.

00:32:55.130 --> 00:32:58.750
You're not telling as much of
the story as you could tell,

00:32:58.750 --> 00:33:02.430
and it's doing yourself
a disservice.

00:33:02.430 --> 00:33:04.440
Here's another question
for the group.

00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:06.910
Take the favorite photograph
you've ever taken, and even

00:33:06.910 --> 00:33:08.490
for those of you who don't
think of yourselves as

00:33:08.490 --> 00:33:09.860
photographers--

00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:12.320
just like family historians,
documentarians--

00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:16.000
think of the favorite photo that
you ever took, and think

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.010
about your great great
grandchildren looking at it

00:33:19.010 --> 00:33:21.580
some time in the future.

00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:24.590
What are they going to know?

00:33:24.590 --> 00:33:27.270
We don't live in an age where we
can scribble on the back of

00:33:27.270 --> 00:33:31.560
a photograph, but we do live in
an age where we can catalog

00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:36.100
everything on social networks
and personal portfolio sites.

00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:39.250
But if you're not doing that
beyond metadata, beyond this

00:33:39.250 --> 00:33:42.530
is this point in time and here's
what was going on, et

00:33:42.530 --> 00:33:44.735
cetera, et cetera,
lost opportunity.

00:33:47.290 --> 00:33:49.730
I just love this image, because
I did a whole long

00:33:49.730 --> 00:33:53.530
conversation between the two
gibbons about what it was.

00:33:53.530 --> 00:33:55.630
It's not a hippopotamus, even
though it looks like

00:33:55.630 --> 00:33:57.910
hippopotamus and it sort of
smells like a pig, and it just

00:33:57.910 --> 00:34:02.690
went to this whole, it was like
me writing a comedy bit.

00:34:02.690 --> 00:34:04.130
And I probably should've
put it here, because

00:34:04.130 --> 00:34:05.050
it really was funny.

00:34:05.050 --> 00:34:08.699
Trust me, I'm a good writer.

00:34:08.699 --> 00:34:10.320
But whatever.

00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:13.130
Same thing with the gelada.

00:34:13.130 --> 00:34:16.580
Is this dog happy or sad?

00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:20.500
I can tell you this is a world
champions sled dog,

00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:24.280
lead sled dog, dog.

00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:28.460
Happy as a pig in mud.

00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:33.810
Safe, comfortable, in the
freezing cold northern

00:34:33.810 --> 00:34:37.510
Canadian wilderness
that I was in.

00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:39.850
So happy, and you'd
never know it.

00:34:43.159 --> 00:34:44.250
Same thing here.

00:34:44.250 --> 00:34:51.600
Without the story, the guy in
the middle had just finished

00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:53.840
having his way with his
two favorite ladies.

00:34:56.684 --> 00:34:59.210
Does he look sad?

00:34:59.210 --> 00:35:00.080
I don't know.

00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:03.570
Now that you know what's going
on, is he just tired and

00:35:03.570 --> 00:35:04.820
wishing he had a cigarette?

00:35:07.210 --> 00:35:09.970
Power of story and context.

00:35:09.970 --> 00:35:11.600
I'm going to go a little
quicker here.

00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:14.080
Now, education is important,
I said that before.

00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:17.900
I started a series a few years
ago for the Ritz Carlton

00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:20.310
hotels, textured birds.

00:35:20.310 --> 00:35:23.230
I was inspired by the
Renaissance portrait show at

00:35:23.230 --> 00:35:25.330
the Metropolitan Museum of
Art, and I just wanted to

00:35:25.330 --> 00:35:26.140
recreate it.

00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:29.200
And so I started doing these
things, and immediately people

00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:30.990
start saying, well, how
do you do that?

00:35:30.990 --> 00:35:32.210
Well, the decision is made.

00:35:32.210 --> 00:35:32.970
Do you tell them or not?

00:35:32.970 --> 00:35:35.800
And of course I'm of
the mindset of

00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:37.380
course you show them.

00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:39.140
You show them, and show
them, and show them.

00:35:39.140 --> 00:35:41.720
And thanks to Hangouts on air,
and all the wonderful things

00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:45.300
that you all have provided,
it allows me to teach.

00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:47.460
I have my own television
network, I have my own TV

00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:51.340
channels, and shows that we all
can do, and all that does

00:35:51.340 --> 00:35:53.880
this make me better, and make
me happy when I see people

00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:56.390
being inspired by the work.

00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:59.840
So share using your words, for
good, to make other people

00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:03.130
better I don't know, I'd say
that's a pretty important

00:36:03.130 --> 00:36:05.295
thing once you get to a certain
level of maturity.

00:36:09.930 --> 00:36:11.490
I was channeling Ansel Adams.

00:36:11.490 --> 00:36:13.730
I wanted to be him for
a period of time.

00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:22.310
I was in a really dark place,
literally and figuratively,

00:36:22.310 --> 00:36:24.430
emotionally.

00:36:24.430 --> 00:36:26.990
And it's amazing what happens
when you just go for a walk

00:36:26.990 --> 00:36:28.930
when you're in a bad
place, because, in

00:36:28.930 --> 00:36:31.460
this case, it follows.

00:36:31.460 --> 00:36:35.400
Sometimes happy places find
you, but it allows me to

00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:38.640
excise demons, so to speak.

00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:41.380
We had Hurricane Sandy last
year on the east coast.

00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:42.800
I'm sure some of you may
have heard of it.

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:46.590
But we've also catastrophes,
and I didn't want to go out

00:36:46.590 --> 00:36:49.060
and shoot, because it
felt too personal.

00:36:49.060 --> 00:36:51.750
Because so many people had lost
things, and this is the

00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:53.160
Hudson River.

00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:56.420
So I went to a part that I
normally go to shoot sunsets.

00:36:56.420 --> 00:36:58.270
We have crappy sunsets
on the east coast.

00:36:58.270 --> 00:37:01.750
You guys, I'm so jealous, you
have much better sunsets.

00:37:01.750 --> 00:37:04.690
And this is what I saw.

00:37:04.690 --> 00:37:08.260
And it took me an hour, normally
a five minute drive,

00:37:08.260 --> 00:37:10.530
to get to this place, because so
many trees were down and so

00:37:10.530 --> 00:37:11.930
many roads were closed.

00:37:11.930 --> 00:37:14.350
And it was really despondent.

00:37:14.350 --> 00:37:18.110
It was so sad that this
was going on.

00:37:18.110 --> 00:37:23.890
And then I took a walk
further that way, and

00:37:23.890 --> 00:37:25.691
this is what I found.

00:37:25.691 --> 00:37:30.570
I found this glass is half full,
I'm excited, fishing's

00:37:30.570 --> 00:37:32.650
is going to be friggin'
awesome!

00:37:35.150 --> 00:37:38.740
And immediately my mood lifted,
and I had to share it.

00:37:38.740 --> 00:37:41.470
I had to share it because so
many people on the east coast

00:37:41.470 --> 00:37:45.320
were so funked out.

00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:48.690
And so being able to talk
about it helps.

00:37:48.690 --> 00:37:51.970
This is from a photo walk I
just did in your honor a

00:37:51.970 --> 00:37:53.880
couple of weeks back.

00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:55.860
My first time over the Brooklyn
Bridge, and there was

00:37:55.860 --> 00:38:02.280
this couple, and they seem to
be kind of happy before.

00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:09.350
And I called her over, and I
said, how do you really feel.

00:38:09.350 --> 00:38:12.900
Is this the guy you're
going to marry?

00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:14.590
I said hold that thought.

00:38:14.590 --> 00:38:15.230
Go back.

00:38:15.230 --> 00:38:16.420
I called him over.

00:38:16.420 --> 00:38:19.100
How do you feel about
this girl?

00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:21.040
You're going to show
me in a second.

00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:22.450
Hold the thought.

00:38:22.450 --> 00:38:27.270
And I said OK, show me how you
feel about each other.

00:38:27.270 --> 00:38:28.520
Click.

00:38:32.530 --> 00:38:33.900
So it's fun to talk to people.

00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:35.030
It's fun.

00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:38.240
Including people you would
never ever talk to.

00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:40.240
Because this guy was
kind of scary, too.

00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:42.060
Anyone who had tattooed their
face, I mean, they would think

00:38:42.060 --> 00:38:46.250
nothing like taking a spork
and trying to tattoo mine.

00:38:46.250 --> 00:38:48.230
That's kind of the thing.

00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:51.880
So it's also a little bit of
confidence builder, a bit of a

00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:55.350
creative exercise to go and
approach someone and to say,

00:38:55.350 --> 00:38:59.063
oh my god, you are fascinating,
and I just want

00:38:59.063 --> 00:39:00.050
to take your picture.

00:39:00.050 --> 00:39:02.100
May I please?

00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:04.540
Not yours, yours.

00:39:04.540 --> 00:39:06.320
And sometimes it's like
making that decision.

00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:09.490
Because when you get a group of
interesting people, I want

00:39:09.490 --> 00:39:13.730
you, but then this one wants
to get into the equation.

00:39:13.730 --> 00:39:15.440
All right, now go ahead.

00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:18.400
Or you get a group mentality and
you start playing one off

00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:21.240
the other, like all right, show
me something, good, OK,

00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:23.540
now your turn, now your
turn, your turn.

00:39:23.540 --> 00:39:24.800
You lose, you're out.

00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:26.710
Now, with three of you,
let's do it again.

00:39:26.710 --> 00:39:28.680
Now give me a little bit more.

00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:31.210
So that's the fun of being
a photographer.

00:39:31.210 --> 00:39:35.250
But it's also the fun of telling
these stories, now in

00:39:35.250 --> 00:39:39.880
words, but in spoken word rather
than written word.

00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:43.610
I have a thing for
tattoos, I guess.

00:39:43.610 --> 00:39:47.770
Sometimes themes start
to emerge for me.

00:39:47.770 --> 00:39:51.460
I talked about teachers
before.

00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:54.340
This woman is a teacher
from Selma, Alabama.

00:39:54.340 --> 00:40:00.230
So I think back to my history,
and she was of a certain age,

00:40:00.230 --> 00:40:02.730
and we started an entire
conversation about

00:40:02.730 --> 00:40:06.460
segregation, and about Doctor
King, and about things that

00:40:06.460 --> 00:40:12.440
were important to me and clearly
life changing for her.

00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:15.000
And I asked her to think about
those moments and close your

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:18.400
eyes, and think back.

00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:20.470
And in this case, normally I
would wait for them to open

00:40:20.470 --> 00:40:23.780
their eyes, but I saw something
in her eyes closed,

00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:26.730
because of the earlier
conversation that I just had

00:40:26.730 --> 00:40:27.420
to capture.

00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:29.030
This wasn't a mistake.

00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:30.780
This was keep your eyes
closed please.

00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:37.110
And that led to this idea of
seeing what people look like

00:40:37.110 --> 00:40:38.920
with their eyes closed.

00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:41.490
This woman wouldn't close
her eyes from me.

00:40:41.490 --> 00:40:42.220
Same place though.

00:40:42.220 --> 00:40:44.860
All of these people are from
the deep South and lived

00:40:44.860 --> 00:40:47.100
through segregation.

00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:50.480
And I just find it interesting
when we talk about it and we

00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:51.730
put things together.

00:40:54.830 --> 00:40:57.230
And the last one.

00:40:57.230 --> 00:41:01.030
And sometimes images are
powerful together, but if I

00:41:01.030 --> 00:41:03.790
hadn't told you that this was
people thinking about

00:41:03.790 --> 00:41:07.960
segregation, my guess is it
wouldn't have been as

00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:09.530
important to you.

00:41:09.530 --> 00:41:16.220
And here's parade shot
one, parade shot two.

00:41:16.220 --> 00:41:18.640
Same parade.

00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:20.830
Veterans Day.

00:41:20.830 --> 00:41:25.000
Father's on the float,
father is overseas.

00:41:30.300 --> 00:41:33.360
Teachers really important
to me.

00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:34.320
Pay teachers like rock stars.

00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:37.130
These are both teachers, and
when I was talking about just

00:41:37.130 --> 00:41:40.820
that, you guys should make a
million dollars, $10 million,

00:41:40.820 --> 00:41:44.010
you should have concerts
sold, filled if

00:41:44.010 --> 00:41:45.660
you're a good teacher.

00:41:45.660 --> 00:41:48.550
We should fill arenas
so that you can

00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:49.600
broadcast your message.

00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:52.570
That's what I believe.

00:41:52.570 --> 00:41:54.490
And that was his reaction.

00:41:54.490 --> 00:41:56.150
And that was her reaction.

00:41:56.150 --> 00:41:58.520
Processed differently,
but that's the fun.

00:41:58.520 --> 00:42:00.850
And lastly this is
show me love.

00:42:00.850 --> 00:42:05.220
Actually, show me hate,
show me love.

00:42:05.220 --> 00:42:06.590
Hate, love.

00:42:06.590 --> 00:42:09.130
One of my fun things to do.

00:42:09.130 --> 00:42:11.870
And we're going to end with
a little pretty couple of

00:42:11.870 --> 00:42:15.140
things, because I meet a lot of
people, and I hear a lot of

00:42:15.140 --> 00:42:18.250
stories that make me feel
a range of things.

00:42:18.250 --> 00:42:21.970
They make me feel happy in a lot
of cases, but they make me

00:42:21.970 --> 00:42:27.930
feel despair, and anger, and
want to do something.

00:42:27.930 --> 00:42:31.370
And it can get to me, because
I'm an emotional guy, and so I

00:42:31.370 --> 00:42:33.410
used to say, when things are
looking down find something

00:42:33.410 --> 00:42:34.470
beautiful looking up.

00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:36.660
There's a one liner, there's
a cliche to put on the wall

00:42:36.660 --> 00:42:39.690
somewhere, or a Hallmark card.

00:42:39.690 --> 00:42:45.880
And so I started shooting
flowers to make me happy.

00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:48.210
To write love notes with.

00:42:48.210 --> 00:42:50.570
To do whatever I need to do.

00:42:50.570 --> 00:42:51.980
But there's always a story
that goes with

00:42:51.980 --> 00:42:54.690
the flowers, as well.

00:42:54.690 --> 00:42:56.480
And that's the talk.

00:42:56.480 --> 00:42:59.870
When are you use your words,
your world will expand.

00:42:59.870 --> 00:43:02.490
Here's two lines to end--

00:43:02.490 --> 00:43:07.810
photography can make you think,
and make you feel.

00:43:07.810 --> 00:43:10.940
Photographs and words
can make you do.

00:43:14.050 --> 00:43:15.300
Thank you.

00:43:24.460 --> 00:43:25.980
Questions?

00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:30.070
AUDIENCE: How do you best share
your stories with photos

00:43:30.070 --> 00:43:31.390
using online media?

00:43:31.390 --> 00:43:35.490
Because I have I Plus and
Facebook and Smugmug, and lots

00:43:35.490 --> 00:43:40.370
of platforms, but haven't really
settled on one or kind

00:43:40.370 --> 00:43:43.840
of figured out what the best way
to have that archive and

00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:44.660
share it effectively.

00:43:44.660 --> 00:43:47.715
So I'd love to hear what--

00:43:47.715 --> 00:43:53.710
ALAN SHAPIRO: I have embraced
Google+ huge, having been a

00:43:53.710 --> 00:43:57.510
Facebook person for as long
as they were around.

00:43:57.510 --> 00:43:59.430
Really, as a marketing person,
it's important to me to

00:43:59.430 --> 00:44:00.790
understand social media.

00:44:00.790 --> 00:44:04.370
It's the game changer, in recent
times, for brands and

00:44:04.370 --> 00:44:06.760
marketers, so it's important.

00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:10.510
So when Google+ first
came out, OK, join.

00:44:10.510 --> 00:44:12.530
See what it's like.

00:44:12.530 --> 00:44:16.630
And hope that the experience
would deliver what it did.

00:44:16.630 --> 00:44:21.440
That a true community
would be formed.

00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:25.400
But to answer your question, I
have a blog that I wonder if I

00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:27.775
even need, because of
my Google+ presence.

00:44:30.460 --> 00:44:32.740
When I remember, I
post to Facebook.

00:44:32.740 --> 00:44:35.620
When I remember, because it's
out of sight, out of mind,

00:44:35.620 --> 00:44:37.520
thankfully.

00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:41.940
I do have a portfolio site, and
I do maintain presences on

00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:44.210
things like [INAUDIBLE], because
of the connection to

00:44:44.210 --> 00:44:46.660
Adobe, and even prior to them.

00:44:46.660 --> 00:44:50.350
But what I would say to you is
where are the people you want

00:44:50.350 --> 00:44:52.830
to talk to you?

00:44:52.830 --> 00:44:55.340
And if you know where they are,
you'll very quickly be

00:44:55.340 --> 00:45:00.930
able to figure out how to reach
them very selectively.

00:45:00.930 --> 00:45:03.910
And until someone makes a
plug-in-- because we've tried,

00:45:03.910 --> 00:45:06.580
in the advertising world.

00:45:06.580 --> 00:45:08.890
There have been many dashboards
created where you

00:45:08.890 --> 00:45:11.390
can take an image and you can
post it to all of the various

00:45:11.390 --> 00:45:14.110
social networks, and
Twitter, et cetera.

00:45:14.110 --> 00:45:17.630
But everyone's different,
and it still becomes

00:45:17.630 --> 00:45:19.740
kind of time consuming.

00:45:19.740 --> 00:45:23.070
So where do you want
to be heard?

00:45:23.070 --> 00:45:26.403
I can get specific off camera,
I just you know, don't.

00:45:26.403 --> 00:45:27.820
Anybody?

00:45:27.820 --> 00:45:29.910
AUDIENCE: Regarding your comment
about talking about

00:45:29.910 --> 00:45:35.160
your pieces, I tend not to talk
about my photos because I

00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:38.723
don't want to limit the response
of the viewer.

00:45:38.723 --> 00:45:41.530
Do you ever consider that?

00:45:41.530 --> 00:45:43.332
Is that a concern for you?

00:45:43.332 --> 00:45:44.660
ALAN SHAPIRO: It used to be.

00:45:44.660 --> 00:45:47.500
But it was a conscious decision
for me to want to

00:45:47.500 --> 00:45:51.880
tell a bigger story than
the photo would.

00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:57.400
Having talked to a bunch of my
friends in the online world--

00:45:57.400 --> 00:45:58.680
is it a good thing,
is it a bad thing?

00:45:58.680 --> 00:46:00.270
That's the question I posed.

00:46:00.270 --> 00:46:04.410
Many of them had this told me
that sometimes they'll read my

00:46:04.410 --> 00:46:07.060
comments first, and sometimes
they'll wait for later,

00:46:07.060 --> 00:46:08.620
depending on what I'm posting.

00:46:08.620 --> 00:46:11.930
If it's a particularly
provocative image to them,

00:46:11.930 --> 00:46:13.570
they'll look at the image, and
they'll take it in, and

00:46:13.570 --> 00:46:15.810
they'll form their opinion,
and then they'll go and

00:46:15.810 --> 00:46:18.290
they'll look at the comment.

00:46:18.290 --> 00:46:22.290
And I think audiences are smart
enough these days to be

00:46:22.290 --> 00:46:23.900
able to discern.

00:46:23.900 --> 00:46:27.350
But if you don't post it,
something else is

00:46:27.350 --> 00:46:28.080
going to come up.

00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:31.000
Life is going to pick you up
and plop you down somewhere

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:33.800
else, and you'll forget, and
then that may be the moment

00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:36.900
that your great grandchildren
choose to look at and wonder

00:46:36.900 --> 00:46:38.970
what was going on.

00:46:38.970 --> 00:46:41.410
So I always do it.

00:46:41.410 --> 00:46:44.050
AUDIENCE: So obviously, attached
to each picture, you

00:46:44.050 --> 00:46:48.080
have very fond memories, and
you're very capable of, it

00:46:48.080 --> 00:46:53.250
seems like, connecting
via empathy with the

00:46:53.250 --> 00:46:54.690
photos that you take.

00:46:54.690 --> 00:46:56.520
Which is really admiring.

00:46:56.520 --> 00:47:00.880
But then, how much time do you
spent translating that into a

00:47:00.880 --> 00:47:04.870
story, that then you associate
with your picture, and how do

00:47:04.870 --> 00:47:06.580
you keep track of the
story plus the

00:47:06.580 --> 00:47:08.430
picture together in this--

00:47:08.430 --> 00:47:09.850
I'm sure you take thousands
of photos.

00:47:09.850 --> 00:47:14.460
ALAN SHAPIRO: Yeah, as a
creative thinker, right?

00:47:14.460 --> 00:47:15.140
I mean, that's my job.

00:47:15.140 --> 00:47:19.130
My job is to make order out of
chaos, is to solve problems

00:47:19.130 --> 00:47:20.380
creatively.

00:47:22.250 --> 00:47:23.840
Sometimes I'll look at an
image and I'll know

00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:25.900
immediately what I want
to say, and it

00:47:25.900 --> 00:47:28.270
will flow like water.

00:47:28.270 --> 00:47:31.100
And sometimes I will look at an
image and nothing will come

00:47:31.100 --> 00:47:33.800
other than the absolute obvious,
but it's a particular

00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:37.120
image that I don't want to be
obvious with, and so I'll

00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:39.060
spend a little bit more time
thinking about. it.

00:47:39.060 --> 00:47:42.990
So I consider it, like any
creative exercise any one of

00:47:42.990 --> 00:47:45.280
us has ever gone through,
sometimes it's easy,

00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:48.040
sometimes it's not.

00:47:48.040 --> 00:47:52.480
AUDIENCE: So, in addition to
that, tactically, how do you

00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:54.220
associate this?

00:47:54.220 --> 00:47:57.900
What do you do to keep photo
one is story one.

00:47:57.900 --> 00:47:58.970
Do you know what I mean?

00:47:58.970 --> 00:47:59.910
Because you can't just--

00:47:59.910 --> 00:48:01.690
ALAN SHAPIRO: I don't sleep
much, and so normally, when I

00:48:01.690 --> 00:48:05.520
come back, and I'll edit, I'll
do a very quick edit, and I've

00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:07.230
also got a pretty
decent memory.

00:48:07.230 --> 00:48:09.020
I'm not sure it's photographic,
but it's pretty

00:48:09.020 --> 00:48:09.610
damn close.

00:48:09.610 --> 00:48:11.430
So I just remember--

00:48:11.430 --> 00:48:12.810
other than how to spell--

00:48:12.810 --> 00:48:15.240
I remember names and
things like that.

00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:17.400
And it's important to me.

00:48:17.400 --> 00:48:19.430
So when it's important to you,
you tend to remember more.

00:48:19.430 --> 00:48:20.350
So it just--

00:48:20.350 --> 00:48:22.970
it happens.

00:48:22.970 --> 00:48:23.920
Does that help you?

00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:25.120
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:28.240
ALAN SHAPIRO: I used to use a
manual typewriter when I was a

00:48:28.240 --> 00:48:30.870
little kid, and I think
something about that

00:48:30.870 --> 00:48:35.900
experience relates now to
why I love photography.

00:48:35.900 --> 00:48:38.880
The shutter, the pressing of
a button, different from a

00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:43.010
keyboard, different from
electric typewriter.

00:48:43.010 --> 00:48:46.580
So that was random,
but just to share.

00:48:46.580 --> 00:48:50.260
AUDIENCE: How do you ice break
with the crowd that you're

00:48:50.260 --> 00:48:51.900
walking up to?

00:48:51.900 --> 00:48:55.830
Do you have a set of scripts
in your head that you run

00:48:55.830 --> 00:48:58.810
through and decide, OK, with
this crowd I want to do this?

00:48:58.810 --> 00:49:02.130
Or do you not?

00:49:02.130 --> 00:49:03.420
ALAN SHAPIRO: I'm a pretty
good improviser.

00:49:03.420 --> 00:49:05.360
There are some situations, I
mean like when you walk into a

00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:09.680
room wanting to meet people, and
sort of just being open.

00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:11.630
Another one liner that I should
have put in here, the

00:49:11.630 --> 00:49:14.150
bigger the smile you give, the
bigger the smile you get.

00:49:14.150 --> 00:49:14.440
Right?

00:49:14.440 --> 00:49:16.490
So when your friendly, when
you're approachable,

00:49:16.490 --> 00:49:17.850
especially when you're
walking around with a

00:49:17.850 --> 00:49:20.180
somewhat big lens--

00:49:20.180 --> 00:49:22.830
which I like, because it gets
a certain reaction--

00:49:22.830 --> 00:49:23.860
I need to--

00:49:23.860 --> 00:49:24.080
right?

00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:24.545
Its theater.

00:49:24.545 --> 00:49:27.700
But I need to balance that
with a little bit of

00:49:27.700 --> 00:49:28.910
lightheartedness.

00:49:28.910 --> 00:49:31.130
And so sometimes, it's
love your shoes,

00:49:31.130 --> 00:49:32.110
tell me about them.

00:49:32.110 --> 00:49:36.220
In most cases, unless I'm just
out and about, and I don't

00:49:36.220 --> 00:49:39.850
really care, but when I'm on a
mission, I will not even have

00:49:39.850 --> 00:49:40.645
my camera up.

00:49:40.645 --> 00:49:44.290
I will leave it on my side
while I'm engaging.

00:49:44.290 --> 00:49:46.640
And in some cases 10, 15 minutes
can go by just making

00:49:46.640 --> 00:49:49.120
conversation with people before
it's like, would you

00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:51.490
mind if I took your picture?

00:49:51.490 --> 00:49:54.290
And then that gives you the sort
of inspiration to take

00:49:54.290 --> 00:49:58.530
them places, tell me more
about fill in the blank.

00:49:58.530 --> 00:50:01.350
And sometimes it's as simple
as scream for me.

00:50:01.350 --> 00:50:03.950
AUDIENCE: So Thomas Hawk, who
came and talked last year, was

00:50:03.950 --> 00:50:07.250
talking about the fact that
when he goes out into San

00:50:07.250 --> 00:50:09.730
Fransisco, to the pan handlers
and takes their pictures, he

00:50:09.730 --> 00:50:12.470
actually offers them $1 to take
their pictures, because

00:50:12.470 --> 00:50:15.850
that way, he gets a great
picture, and they get $1.

00:50:15.850 --> 00:50:19.270
I don't know if you've done
anything like that.

00:50:19.270 --> 00:50:23.150
ALAN SHAPIRO: I respect
Thomas, I do that.

00:50:23.150 --> 00:50:26.780
I buy them lunch, I buy them
dinner, I take them to get

00:50:26.780 --> 00:50:27.550
their medicine.

00:50:27.550 --> 00:50:29.650
You do what you think
you need to do.

00:50:32.630 --> 00:50:33.840
And they're the people
who need it.

00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:36.270
So it's the right thing to do.

00:50:36.270 --> 00:50:38.510
It shouldn't ever be about
stealing a photo.

00:50:38.510 --> 00:50:40.400
In my world, in my style.

00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:42.500
I mean, there were street
shooters who certainly believe

00:50:42.500 --> 00:50:45.920
in that random, spontaneous
moment, and you can't go up

00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:47.720
and approach someone, and
then expect them to

00:50:47.720 --> 00:50:49.350
be spontaneous after.

00:50:49.350 --> 00:50:50.570
So there's different schools.

00:50:50.570 --> 00:50:54.160
For me, it's about engagement,
it's about connecting.

00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:56.850
AUDIENCE: Do you have any
ideas on how to sort of

00:50:56.850 --> 00:51:00.690
include a story with
a physical print?

00:51:00.690 --> 00:51:06.620
ALAN SHAPIRO: I would love it
if someone could help me--

00:51:06.620 --> 00:51:09.500
and I need to spend more time
talking to the labs.

00:51:09.500 --> 00:51:11.430
I need to make time
to do that.

00:51:11.430 --> 00:51:16.330
I would love it if, depending
on the type of story teller

00:51:16.330 --> 00:51:21.690
you are, you could just mount a
picture of a particular size

00:51:21.690 --> 00:51:23.670
with a large enough mat where
you can include it.

00:51:23.670 --> 00:51:26.410
And it becomes a design
exercise, if

00:51:26.410 --> 00:51:26.970
you think about it.

00:51:26.970 --> 00:51:29.600
You're just making an
oversized poster on

00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:33.370
photographic paper, watercolor
paper, whatever.

00:51:33.370 --> 00:51:35.210
Maybe that's something we should
talk to the Adobe folks

00:51:35.210 --> 00:51:36.660
about, or Bay Photo
or whoever.

00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:43.030
For me, it's about books.

00:51:43.030 --> 00:51:45.320
It's about a longer
form narrative.

00:51:45.320 --> 00:51:47.850
As I start looking at the work
I like, and the type of

00:51:47.850 --> 00:51:51.750
processing I do-- so a lot of
the on black work I do is from

00:51:51.750 --> 00:51:54.160
a series called "Emerging From
Shadows", and so that will go

00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:55.580
into a book.

00:51:55.580 --> 00:51:59.330
And so it's easy to tell
the stories there.

00:51:59.330 --> 00:52:02.250
And a veteran's book, and a
homeless person book, and

00:52:02.250 --> 00:52:03.860
whatever happens to come.

00:52:06.650 --> 00:52:07.660
But there's no solution.

00:52:07.660 --> 00:52:10.830
So if someone comes up with
it, I'd be very grateful.

00:52:10.830 --> 00:52:12.730
AUDIENCE: So I'm a photographer,
and I'm one of

00:52:12.730 --> 00:52:15.630
the people who struggles to use
my own words, and some of

00:52:15.630 --> 00:52:19.230
that is just finding the right
way to tell the story that's

00:52:19.230 --> 00:52:20.870
interesting.

00:52:20.870 --> 00:52:23.590
And some of it is that I feel
like and emotionally giving

00:52:23.590 --> 00:52:27.290
more of myself away than
maybe I'm willing to.

00:52:27.290 --> 00:52:30.810
But as a consumer of
photography, are you more

00:52:30.810 --> 00:52:36.030
likely to bypass images that
don't have words with them?

00:52:36.030 --> 00:52:36.750
ALAN SHAPIRO: Me personally?

00:52:36.750 --> 00:52:38.000
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:52:40.090 --> 00:52:41.040
ALAN SHAPIRO: No.

00:52:41.040 --> 00:52:45.620
No, I'm a lover photography.

00:52:45.620 --> 00:52:49.250
I love photographers,
I love the range.

00:52:49.250 --> 00:52:53.140
What I find is that there's
a lot of sameness,

00:52:53.140 --> 00:52:54.890
though, in our world.

00:52:54.890 --> 00:52:58.940
And if I have 20 landscape
photographs in front of me,

00:52:58.940 --> 00:53:01.510
they're all beautiful.

00:53:01.510 --> 00:53:04.750
The tie breaker, for me, in
terms of making a deeper

00:53:04.750 --> 00:53:10.230
connection with the artist,
is how the words enter in.

00:53:10.230 --> 00:53:11.410
Because now it becomes
branding.

00:53:11.410 --> 00:53:14.300
As a photographer, you want
people to know to you, and how

00:53:14.300 --> 00:53:16.810
you feel about a
certain thing.

00:53:16.810 --> 00:53:21.610
Put 20 people in front of a
beautiful sunset, and you

00:53:21.610 --> 00:53:24.660
might get 20 different photos,
but more likely you'll get 20

00:53:24.660 --> 00:53:27.300
photos that are fairly
similar.

00:53:27.300 --> 00:53:28.260
So how do you break the tie?

00:53:28.260 --> 00:53:30.210
Who do you like more?

00:53:30.210 --> 00:53:32.430
And that's where hearing your
point of view, whether it's

00:53:32.430 --> 00:53:35.250
the poetry you write, or--

00:53:35.250 --> 00:53:38.660
because it doesn't have to
be about personal giving.

00:53:38.660 --> 00:53:42.400
I like that for me, but for you,
it may be just helping

00:53:42.400 --> 00:53:45.835
educate people, or just
talking about

00:53:45.835 --> 00:53:47.270
the sounds you heard.

00:53:47.270 --> 00:53:52.810
It doesn't have to take you to a
place that is too revealing.

00:53:52.810 --> 00:53:55.560
But it's really about
sharing in this

00:53:55.560 --> 00:53:59.030
wonderful world of ours.

00:53:59.030 --> 00:54:01.140
It's what I want to do.

00:54:01.140 --> 00:54:03.400
AUDIENCE: I know you, and still,
listening to you talk

00:54:03.400 --> 00:54:05.030
and seeing the images.

00:54:05.030 --> 00:54:08.570
I do photography and voice over,
and I taught voice for

00:54:08.570 --> 00:54:13.120
25 years, and I know voice
intimately, and things about

00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:15.680
the voice and the sound, and the
reason I ask the question

00:54:15.680 --> 00:54:19.210
about do you ever record, first,
I thought their voice,

00:54:19.210 --> 00:54:22.510
just because the thing about
a voice is it carries the

00:54:22.510 --> 00:54:26.100
complete imprint of who you
are, on every level.

00:54:26.100 --> 00:54:30.100
So the photographs are just
unbelievable, and the stories

00:54:30.100 --> 00:54:31.760
are even more so.

00:54:31.760 --> 00:54:34.270
And then I think about the
recordings of my mother that

00:54:34.270 --> 00:54:39.610
her family made when
she was maybe 15.

00:54:39.610 --> 00:54:42.470
She and her father
sang together.

00:54:42.470 --> 00:54:45.350
And I know, obviously, right
now, you've only been shooting

00:54:45.350 --> 00:54:48.060
for a few years, and this is all
very new, but of course,

00:54:48.060 --> 00:54:52.260
as we know, we think a little
further than today.

00:54:52.260 --> 00:54:52.990
I don't know.

00:54:52.990 --> 00:54:54.260
It's just an interesting
thought.

00:54:54.260 --> 00:54:57.940
And then hearing you, and the
passion and the heart and soul

00:54:57.940 --> 00:55:01.760
in your voice about the whole
thing is just so powerful.

00:55:01.760 --> 00:55:02.850
ALAN SHAPIRO: Thank
you for that.

00:55:02.850 --> 00:55:07.860
I think, for me, there's still
a barrier between--

00:55:07.860 --> 00:55:09.920
as ubiquitous as photography
has become.

00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:12.120
Everyone's a photographer.

00:55:12.120 --> 00:55:14.680
Unless you don't have a mobile
device with a camera built in,

00:55:14.680 --> 00:55:15.950
you're a photographer.

00:55:15.950 --> 00:55:17.380
So everyone is used to
having pictures be

00:55:17.380 --> 00:55:21.690
taken, but they're still--

00:55:21.690 --> 00:55:25.070
if I hold something up,
something happens, right?

00:55:25.070 --> 00:55:27.980
The synapses in your brain
say fight or flight?

00:55:27.980 --> 00:55:28.500
Smile?

00:55:28.500 --> 00:55:29.270
What do I do?

00:55:29.270 --> 00:55:30.490
Fear?

00:55:30.490 --> 00:55:32.290
It happens.

00:55:32.290 --> 00:55:36.680
Add a microphone on top of that,
or anything where now

00:55:36.680 --> 00:55:39.870
you're asking them to behave
even more, and for me, it

00:55:39.870 --> 00:55:43.660
seems like that's another
plateau that I

00:55:43.660 --> 00:55:46.170
would love to get to.

00:55:46.170 --> 00:55:48.820
Not yet.

00:55:48.820 --> 00:55:52.076
There's still too many
people to me.

00:55:52.076 --> 00:55:53.905
Yeah, well, I'll do
that on a show.

00:55:57.760 --> 00:56:01.570
AUDIENCE: Some of the recent
G+ UI changes seem to

00:56:01.570 --> 00:56:03.390
accentuate the visual
over the text.

00:56:03.390 --> 00:56:06.294
ALAN SHAPIRO: Yeah.

00:56:06.294 --> 00:56:07.746
AUDIENCE: Tell us how
you feel about that.

00:56:12.670 --> 00:56:16.500
ALAN SHAPIRO: I think you need
to give people choices.

00:56:16.500 --> 00:56:18.420
And you clearly do.

00:56:18.420 --> 00:56:22.730
And so whether I love a bigger
picture, a smaller picture, a

00:56:22.730 --> 00:56:26.520
sharper picture, or not, as long
as I have the ability--

00:56:26.520 --> 00:56:29.380
because I've got a caption box,
and I've got the ability

00:56:29.380 --> 00:56:31.510
to post, and so I've got two
places to leave different

00:56:31.510 --> 00:56:34.170
messages, and sometimes they're
the same, because it's

00:56:34.170 --> 00:56:36.760
not easy to go from one
to the other for me.

00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:39.850
But as long as I'm able to
tell my story in your

00:56:39.850 --> 00:56:42.020
technology, I will embrace it.

00:56:45.850 --> 00:56:50.010
The photography community's
really vibrant on Google+.

00:56:50.010 --> 00:56:54.110
Incredibly vibrant, which is one
of the reasons some there.

00:56:54.110 --> 00:56:57.020
But if you're a writer who wants
to add visuals, right?

00:56:57.020 --> 00:57:01.340
If you're the opposite person to
me, my paramour over here,

00:57:01.340 --> 00:57:02.970
how would they feel?

00:57:02.970 --> 00:57:06.370
And so, as long as you're
dealing with your audience the

00:57:06.370 --> 00:57:09.960
way you want them to embrace
you, then that's fine.

00:57:09.960 --> 00:57:13.530
But give me the ability to
change fonts, because

00:57:13.530 --> 00:57:15.470
sometimes I want to yell and
sometimes I don't, and that

00:57:15.470 --> 00:57:17.470
would make it ugly, and so we
can't do that, and so it

00:57:17.470 --> 00:57:18.290
doesn't matter.

00:57:18.290 --> 00:57:19.760
It doesn't matter as long
as I can tell the

00:57:19.760 --> 00:57:23.630
story, perfect for me.

00:57:23.630 --> 00:57:24.880
Pleasure, thank you.
