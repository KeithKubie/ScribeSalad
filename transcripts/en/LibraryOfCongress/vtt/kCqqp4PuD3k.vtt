00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.250
&gt;&gt; Joan Weeks: good afternoon
ladies and gentlemen.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.850
On behalf of all my colleagues,
and particular Dr. Mary-Jane Deeb,

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.600
who is Chief of the African
and Middle East Division I'd

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.450
like to welcome everyone.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.650
I'm Joan Weeks, I'm head
of the Near East Section,

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:38.990
the sponsor of today's program.

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:43.830
And we're very pleased to
present this titled Us and Them,

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.060
breaking free from cultural
branding and identity politics.

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.950
Before we start today's program
and introduce our speaker I'd

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.280
like to give you a little bit of
an overview about our collections,

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.050
in the hopes that you'll
come back and use them.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.080
The speaker today is writing
about Iranian Americans.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.510
And I did a quick search
in our catalogue

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.900
and found 43 books on that topic.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.780
And some of them are in Persian
and some of them are in English;

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.960
so you're welcome to come
back into our reading room

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.070
and please use our collections

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:24.160
for your future enjoyment
and for the research.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:29.640
We are a custodial division and we
build collections and serve these

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.910
to researchers from
around the globe.

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:37.140
We cover over 78 countries and
more than two dozen languages.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.260
The Africa section includes all
the countries of Sub-Sahara Africa.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.460
And we're going to have a follow
on program to this, so please stay

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:51.770
if you can to hear our program on
the conversations with Africa Poets

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.400
that will immediately
follow this program.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.730
And we also have the Hebraic
section that covers Judaica

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:01.690
and Hebraic worldwide and our
Near East section covers all

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.860
of the Arab countries,
including North African, Turkey,

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.100
Turkic Central Asia, Iran,
Afghanistan and the Muslims

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.700
in Western China, Russia
and the Balkans.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.600
So, it's a very extensive
research collection area

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:22.180
and just a few housekeeping
items before we get started.

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.690
We like to have you know
that if you ask questions,

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.870
this program is being videotaped,
so implicitly you're getting,

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.080
giving us permission
to videotape you.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.230
And also we have fliers available
if you're interested in our blog

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.790
or Facebook, if you subscribe
to the Facebook you'll hear

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.110 position:56%
about other future programs as well.

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:48.980
So, without further ado though I'd

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.490
like to invite my colleague
Hirad Dinavari

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:55.860
who is our Persian specialist,
to introduce our speaker.

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.660
Thank you.

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.430
&gt;&gt; Hirad Dinavari: Thank
you everyone for coming

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.630
on difficult traffic
day from what I hear.

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.650
It's wonderful to have
our speaker here today;

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:12.020
this would be her second book
that she would be covering at LC.

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:15.580
We love her so much with the
first book that we've invited her

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:22.050
for her new book, which is a very
timely book on immigrants living

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:25.070
over you know, in different
countries essentially.

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:28.580
I will do a short bio, although
she really doesn't need a bio,

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.230
she's well known.

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.770
Ms. Bahiyyih Nakhjavani
grew up in Uganda,

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:37.030
was educated in the
United Kingdom and then

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.640
in the United States,
and now lives in France.

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.260
She is author of the Women who
Read Too Much, which was a book

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.960
on the poetess and
woman leader if you

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:54.520
like Tahirih Qurratu'l-Ayn
19th century icon,

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.060
also she's written The Saddlebag.

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:02.090
Her novels have been published in
French, Italian, Spanish, German,

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.720
Greek, Turkish, Hebrew,
Russian, Korean and Chinese.

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.230
And I hope to this Persian and
Arabic soon will be added as well.

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:16.610
A nice quote from one of her books
is "We abandon our true homeland

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:19.890
when we cannot identify
with others".

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:22.900
I think that captures the
essence of this talk and instead

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.400
of me blabbing on; I would love to
have Bahiyyih herself entice you

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.240
with her wonderful
wisdom and her welcome.

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.510
Thank you.

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:34.170
[ Applause ]

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:35.870
&gt;&gt; Bahiyyih Nakhjavani: It would
have been fun to hear him blabbing

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.520
on rather than me blabbing on.

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:43.630 position:56%
But I would first like to begin with
all my gratitude to Mary-Jane Deeb,

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:49.840
to the Near Eastern Section,
African and Middle Eastern Division

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.950
of the Library of Congress, to Joan
Weeks for her kind introduction

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:57.600
and above all to dear
Hirad for his generosity

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.000
in maintaining correspondence
with me,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.670
all through this last
couple of years.

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:03.780
I've been delighted
to hear from him.

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:11.030
I've given the title of Breaking
Free From Cultural Branding.

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:17.310
Because of something which
happened last year in Britain

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:19.310 position:56%
and you have had your elections here

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:22.590
and this is certainly not
a political discussion,

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:27.980
but it affected me deeply
when I heard Teresa May saying

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:30.400
in October last year that citizens

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.830
of the world were citizens
of nowhere.

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:35.400
And it really struck me
because she was speaking

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:42.100
about a very particular elite who
are well represented in capitals

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:46.030
like Washington with the
international institutions.

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:50.350
I live in Strasburg where there
are all also international elite

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:51.770
if you like in Europe.

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:56.030
And there is a kind of gap between
such people and the ordinary people

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:59.330
in the street, that
is certainly the case.

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:02.260
But I was thinking of all
the billions of people

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:07.000
who are not international
elite, who also find themselves

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.120
as citizens of the world.

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.460 position:56%
And to be told that you're a citizen
of nowhere when you are a refugee,

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:18.880
when you have gone through heroin
conditions of war, of famine,

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:22.620
of deprivation and finally
find yourselves stripped

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:29.130
of everything seemed to me to
be the last gesture of ravage.

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:31.080
It didn't seem fair.

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:35.010
So, it occurred to me that one of
the reasons why we're so worried

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:40.530
about being labeled one way or
another is because we are looking

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:44.480
for labels and maybe people
think that to be called a citizen

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:48.560
of the world is a threat;
so we try to undermine it.

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:52.900
Because of the rise of nationalism
that we see in the world today,

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:58.290
because of the extremes and phobia,
perhaps like in a previous age

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:03.080
where anyone who seemed
to be cosmopolitan,

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:07.990
the word cosmopolitan
became a slur in the 1930's.

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:11.330
Cosmopolitanism became
something like globalism

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:16.660
and it was considered a threat
to the nationalism of the times.

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:22.010
I thought maybe we could look at
the real meaning behind a citizen

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:27.530
of the world and see it as an
inclusive kind of identity,

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:30.870
see it as a way of bringing
people together rather

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:35.060
than imposing wars between them.

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:37.090
Citizens of the world
and those of us

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:43.290
that don't necessarily carry one
name label, that have a brand

00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:48.090
which seems to be multiple,
very often find ourselves sort

00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:52.000
of without a singular identity.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.820 position:56%
And it seems that part of the reason
I needed to write this book was

00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:02.260
because of the fracturing of
identity that I've noticed

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:05.150
in the Iranian diasporic community.

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:09.370
We're not just one group
of people, we're multiple.

00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:14.430
We seem to have identities
that also reflect the cultures

00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:18.130
and the countries from which,
in which we find new homes.

00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:24.210
So, I've set this story in
a kind of ping pong world

00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:30.780
between the French Iranian World
and the American Iranian World.

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:37.800
And I follow the life of the old
lady who has emerged from Iran,

00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:41.750
almost by accident
really, not by desire.

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:45.400
She had wanted to stay in her
country which I think is the case

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:47.700
for most refugees and migrants.

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:50.520
It isn't an act necessarily
of choice.

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:53.560
And she finds herself rather

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:59.270
like a benign King Lear
bouncing between two daughters.

00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:04.030
Now my two daughters are certainly
nothing like Goneril and Regan.

00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:07.890
They have every reason, and
maybe Goneril and Regan did too,

00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:10.670 position:56%
for having chips on their shoulders.

00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:15.400
But, we see their lives through
the lives of the old lady.

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:20.330
We see her through their eyes;
so we're given a chance to look

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:24.600
at the Iranian coming from
Iran, from the point of view

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:26.760
of the diasperin Iranian.

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:30.100
And we looked at the Diasperin
daughters from the point

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:33.200
of view of the Iranian mother.

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:34.660
Every since I started writing,

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:37.250
people have called
me an Iranian writer.

00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:40.470 position:56%
And I don't see how I could
possibly be called an Iranian writer

00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:41.890
if I grew up in East African.

00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:46.800 position:56%
I don't see how I can also be called
an Iranian writer if I'm not living

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:50.570
in Iran talking about Iran today.

00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:53.250
I've written about Iran
in the 19th century,

00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:55.510
which is not what Iran is now.

00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:59.230
And so I realized I had to
write a story about what I knew,

00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:04.040
which was the experience
of being outside Iran.

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:07.020
And not only outside from one
perspective, but since I've lived

00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:09.130
in several countries myself

00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:13.430 position:56%
and since I've met the Iranian
Diaspera all over the place I wanted

00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:18.260
to capture something of that
diversity, that fragmentation.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:21.880
The title, the cover of
this book is interesting

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:25.230
because it reflects broken glass.

00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:31.920
It reflects fractured glass; it
reflects prisms of mirror or glass.

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:34.900
They're not just giving
you one image,

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:40.220
but are giving you different facets
of the image and of the light.

00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:43.510
And I'm particularly
pleased with the cover

00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:48.030
because of an interesting quote
that I discovered by James Joyce.

00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:52.110
As you know he had
difficulty publishing Ulysses

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:55.160
but he also had difficulty
publishing Dubliners.

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:58.850
And it took him something like nine
years before the book came out.

00:10:58.850 --> 00:11:05.070
And in the process, in his
frustration he wrote the following,

00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:07.410
now I've lost it, one second.

00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:08.710
Here we are.

00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:14.420
He wrote to his publisher
saying "I seriously believe

00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:19.260
that you will retard the course
of civilization in Ireland

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:24.110
by preventing the Irish people from
having a good look at themselves

00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:28.000
in my nicely polished
looking glass".

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.910
Now looking glass and
mirrors are something

00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:34.480
that Iranians absolutely love,
you can't go to an Iranian house

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:36.680
without seeing reflections
of yourself

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:38.940
and everybody else on all sides.

00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:44.040
But I think particularly fragmented
glass is something very intimately

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:46.140
associated with Iranian culture.

00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:49.420
They have a way of making
the most remarkable mosaics

00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:51.210
out of pieces of broken mirror.

00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:53.630
And I've often wondered whether
they first have to break the mirror

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:55.810
in order to make the
mosaic, or whether there's

00:11:55.810 --> 00:11:58.180
so much shattered class
all over the place

00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:00.800
that they have found
creative ways of using it.

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:04.090
But in any event broken
mirrors, fractured mirrors,

00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:11.300
balls of broken glass reflecting
refracted rays of light is a met

00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:14.880
of very close to the
Iranian psyche I thought.

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:18.610
And since I have no
pretentions of writing a book

00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:22.330
that could retard the course of
civilization if it was not read

00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:25.100
by the Iranians, I thought it best

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:29.370
to present a fractured
vision of this community.

00:12:29.370 --> 00:12:32.120
I've done it in several ways.

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:36.280
One is because it's simply the
subject matter is fractured.

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:40.200
It's about a scattering of
people all over the world.

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:44.450
But I've also chosen
a narrative structure

00:12:44.450 --> 00:12:48.270
which is reflecting
that fragmentation.

00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:53.610
So, you will find in this story the
threat of the lives of the mother

00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:58.480 position:56%
and her two daughters, the King Lear
threat, which I vaguely described.

00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:01.160
The story of the mother
going from one country

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:03.980
to the other meeting
the French daughter,

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:08.290
meeting the American daughter and
her own experiences in between.

00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:12.550
And between the chapters which
tell you the story of BB John

00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:16.970
and her daughter LiLi in Frane
and her daughter Goli in America

00:13:16.970 --> 00:13:21.830
and her yearning and aching
heart for her absent son

00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:26.970
who disappeared during the
Iran/Iraq War as a young boy of 14

00:13:26.970 --> 00:13:31.970 position:56%
with the Keys of Paradise around his
neck, Ali who has never been found,

00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:35.610
who has never been
confirmed dead or alive.

00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:39.690
And who hovers all the way
through this story as a sort

00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:43.290
of yearned for Messiah figure.

00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:48.110
A kind of promised, who
may or may not ever come.

00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:54.620
He's dangling in the story all the
way through; so BiBi, Goli, Deli --

00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:57.650
oh Sorry, LiLi -- sorry
I'll say it again.

00:13:57.650 --> 00:14:00.910
BiBi the mother, LiLi
the French daughter,

00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:02.660
Goli the American daughter.

00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:06.350
Goli's daughter, Deli because the
Persians absolutely love ending

00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:10.190
names in the family either with
the same vowel or starting them

00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:12.370
with the same set of consonants.

00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:14.960
And Ali who is the absent son.

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:17.820
Between the chapters
that tell you the story

00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:23.570
of this somewhat dysfunctional
family, I have fragmented images

00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:26.420 position:56%
of Persians from all over the world.

00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:31.620
So, you go in and out of the
story by meeting fragments

00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:36.970
of other Iranians in different
countries all over the planet.

00:14:36.970 --> 00:14:39.230
And I explain why I've done

00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:43.090
that in the first chapter,
which is called "Us".

00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:46.010
In this chapter, I
define the meaning

00:14:46.010 --> 00:14:49.490
of that first personal
plural narration.

00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:54.950
Who is the us that is taking us
into these different chapters?

00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:58.790
And I start off by saying that
we, we're waiting for this book

00:14:58.790 --> 00:15:01.010
to come out for quite some time.

00:15:01.010 --> 00:15:02.760
And it doesn't come out.

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:06.210 position:56%
We keep waiting for it, we keep
looking for it, it doesn't come out.

00:15:06.210 --> 00:15:07.940
Who is going to write it?

00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:11.130
Well whoever, it is
that writes it has to do

00:15:11.130 --> 00:15:14.430
so in the first person plural.

00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:19.450
The first person plural is
mandatory in such situations.

00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:26.470
We use this point of view in
Persian to show our modesty,

00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:29.270
to demonstrate our humility.

00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:35.020 position:56%
At times it has to be admitted we
also use it to evade responsibility,

00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:37.060
but that's another issue.

00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:38.780
And I wanted to clarify that so

00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:40.890
that you wouldn't think
the we, was a royal we.

00:15:40.890 --> 00:15:46.120
And you wouldn't imagine
that it was an editorial we.

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:51.650
This is a very specifically Iranian
we and we use the word "Mahi"

00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:56.290
in Persian to sort
of disburse the ego.

00:15:56.290 --> 00:15:59.930
We say, "Oh we are so grateful
that you were able to come.

00:15:59.930 --> 00:16:03.160 position:56%
We are honored that you invited us".

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:08.010
And it's a kind way in its
purist form of showing humility,

00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:11.560
but it's also sometimes
a wee bit hypocritical.

00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:15.480
And at times can be as I said a
way of avoiding responsibility.

00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:20.100
We didn't know, we were
only aware that we were --

00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:23.340
so all the way through
you can get fluctuations

00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:26.790
of this different versions
of the we.

00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:32.280
And the other reason I did it, I
did use this we was because and I'm

00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:36.580
so delighted to hear that there
are 40 other books on the subject

00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:39.300
to the Iranian diaspera
on your shelves.

00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:43.270
But maybe you can tell me
whether I'm correct in saying

00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:47.060
"There was plenty of evidence of
first person singular Iranians

00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:48.710
on the book shop shelves.

00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:52.490
But we were not the
focus of attention.

00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:56.030
Subjective stories abounded
in the chain stores,

00:16:56.030 --> 00:17:00.270
but these were not
about the real we.

00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:04.150
They were about individuals
we could barely identify with.

00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:07.270
A country that no longer existed,

00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:12.720
a past of aesthetic sensibility
belonging to the academic few,

00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:17.440
or a place for the very rich, the
very religious, the very feminist,

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:22.130
or the anti-feminist, the
anti-rich, the anti-religious.

00:17:22.130 --> 00:17:26.980
There were biographies of those
associated with the peacock throne

00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:30.540
or conspiracy theories
about the fall of Mossadegh,

00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:34.790
or the true confessions of
those who still remembered oil

00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:37.080
in World War II and Hitler.

00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:39.890
Or, the fictional memoirs
of pivotal figures

00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:42.890
of the constitutional revolution.

00:17:42.890 --> 00:17:46.570
But none of these stories
actually were

00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:52.810
about the hydra-headed
contradictory, paradoxical us.

00:17:52.810 --> 00:17:59.000
The multiple first person, plural
us in Toronto and Sydney, in Bogota

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.910
and Beijing speaking
Persian all over the world".

00:18:01.910 --> 00:18:06.690
I decided that it was time to
write about that paradoxical,

00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:09.890
contradictory multiple faceted us.

00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:14.100
And so in this book you're going
to discover that us and one

00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:20.340 position:56%
of the other reasons as a writer I
felt a sort of urgency about writing

00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:28.610
in the first person plural
was captured in the words of,

00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:31.470
if I can find her, Aminatta Forna,

00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:37.340
a marvelous sierra laonian Scottish
writer, don't know if you've come

00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:42.550
across her work.Sieranaonian
wonderfully black and beautiful

00:18:42.550 --> 00:18:47.080
and Scottish, speaking English
with a strong Scottish accent.

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:52.070
And she wrote the following, "The
way of literature", she writes,

00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:58.650
"Is to seek universality, writers
try to reach beyond those things

00:18:58.650 --> 00:19:03.770
that divide us, culture,
class, gender, race.

00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:07.600
Given the chance we would
resist classification.

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:14.320 position:56%
I have never met a writer who wishes
to be described as a female writer,

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:19.400
a gay writer, a black writer, an
Asian writer or an African writer.

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:24.690
We would prefer to simply be
called writers", and i would add

00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:29.150
if one were able a human
being, trying to write.

00:19:29.150 --> 00:19:31.510
That is the greatest accolade.

00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:36.760
And because I think writers have
this capacity for universality

00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:39.850
and don't necessarily
want to be branded.

00:19:39.850 --> 00:19:46.150
I decided to write a book about
the suffocation of branding really.

00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:50.670
The impossibility of
branding the free human spirit

00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:52.490
in one single label.

00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:55.890
And it led me to really
wonder why we do have brands.

00:19:55.890 --> 00:19:59.710
I remember in fact, the last time
I had the privilege of coming

00:19:59.710 --> 00:20:01.870
to the Library of Congress
and was talking

00:20:01.870 --> 00:20:03.170
about the Woman who read too much.

00:20:03.170 --> 00:20:06.670
I had a conversation
with a wonderful friend,

00:20:06.670 --> 00:20:08.780
who is sitting here
today and we were talking

00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:13.880
about political identity
and identity politics.

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:18.950
And how strongly it is
influencing our modern society.

00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:22.700
And I found myself
wondering why is it

00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:25.520
so influential in everything we do.

00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:29.310
And I concluded that it has
something to do with the way

00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:35.130
in which tribalism has sort
of married with marketing.

00:20:35.130 --> 00:20:37.500
And I first came across
this phenomenon

00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:41.300
when my own daughter was going
through the passage of adolescence,

00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:46.350
like so many adolescents wanting
to wear black at all times.

00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:49.880
And I found that there
were shops providing for.

00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:53.340
It had been industrialized,
the gothic period

00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:58.310
of puberty had been seized upon
by marketing forces and exploited

00:20:58.310 --> 00:21:03.420
to sell to young vulnerable
people an identity that sort

00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:07.140
of imposed itself on
their individuality.

00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:09.450
And I thought that this
is happening everywhere.

00:21:09.450 --> 00:21:12.650
This is happening on all
levels of our society

00:21:12.650 --> 00:21:17.520
where you're using these branding
labels to tell us who we are,

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:21.790
perhaps because of an
anxiety about who we are,

00:21:21.790 --> 00:21:25.780
perhaps because we fear a
kind of erosion of who we are.

00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:31.370
But it is extremely, it is making
a commodity of us I decided.

00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:34.860
It is truly turning us
into a sales object.

00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:40.850
I wanted to read to you if I
may, the beginning of a chapter

00:21:40.850 --> 00:21:48.520
in America where the character
Goli finds herself undergoing a lot

00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:49.820
of stress.

00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:51.310
I have to find the
chapter, excuse me.

00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:57.510
and she goes in order to relax
and have a bit of calm time.

00:21:57.510 --> 00:22:01.220
She goes to a pedicure
clinic as it were.

00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:06.300
This is Los Angeles, this is
bimbo blonde Persians worrying

00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:09.890
about their appearance with
nose jobs and so forth.

00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:13.380
"Goli was upset and
her feet knew it.

00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:17.920
They were in desperate need,
that's how the brochure put it.

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:21.500
Are your feet in desperate
need, and they were.

00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:25.170 position:56%
There was a solution of course as
there was for everything in America.

00:22:25.170 --> 00:22:27.190
Step inside pedicure perfect

00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:30.560
and we'll change all
that said the brochure.

00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:34.090
So, Goli stepped inside,
sat herself down on one

00:22:34.090 --> 00:22:35.800
of the slippery pink chairs

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:40.220
of pedicure perfect
and took a deep breath.

00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:46.670
The girl who was going to change
all that was called Simberline.

00:22:46.670 --> 00:22:50.650
The tag on her left breast said so.

00:22:50.650 --> 00:22:56.340 position:56%
Americans had this habit of printing
or repeating their name everywhere,

00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:58.450
and expected you to do the same.

00:22:58.450 --> 00:23:03.020
Goli looked at the spelling for a
long time, not sure of the word.

00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:07.260
She'd heard of American and
even Persian girls called Kim,

00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:10.730
but this sounded like the name
of a logging company in Canada

00:23:10.730 --> 00:23:16.050 position:56%
or something, or a product to keep
household germs at bay as they said,

00:23:16.050 --> 00:23:20.030
or a multi-national
that made sanitary pads.

00:23:20.030 --> 00:23:22.770
She hoped the girl didn't think
she was staring at her breasts,

00:23:22.770 --> 00:23:26.310
she was only trying not to cry".

00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:30.660
I want to compare that if you don't
mind, with another little passage

00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:36.870
which comes from the experience
of the old lady coming to France.

00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:42.000
And in this chapter BiBi John
finds herself alone in Paris,

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.900
her daughter LiLi has
gone off to be an artiste.

00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:50.620
LiLi is a photographer and
takes pictures of nude ladies,

00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:54.110
which is something her mother
seriously does not understand.

00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:57.920
So BiBi John is left alone and
in order to have a little bit

00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:00.200 position:56%
of company she leaves the apartment,

00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:04.000
which I have to tell you is an
extremely strange place in her mind

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.690
because it's up a serious

00:24:05.690 --> 00:24:08.920
of very narrow stairwell
going round and round.

00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:12.290
And she gets to this tiny little
apartment on the top floor,

00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:19.230
in the marray with low ceilings and
the smell of drains and everything

00:24:19.230 --> 00:24:21.950
that a Persian lady
would not like to have.

00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:25.100
So, here she is and she
decides to go to the hairdresser

00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:26.920
and then sit in the park.

00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:29.890
And she's going to the Plaste
Voge which is of course,

00:24:29.890 --> 00:24:34.990
one of the most exquisite places in
Paris 17th century, you know Louis,

00:24:34.990 --> 00:24:39.730
the glorious kind of
architecture all the way around,

00:24:39.730 --> 00:24:42.070
which is something she
does not see at all.

00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:45.840
"Dimly through her thick
lenses Bibi saw that one

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:51.150
of the benches was partially
free, with only a single occupant.

00:24:51.150 --> 00:24:53.220
She approached it hopefully,

00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:56.420
but as she drew near the
elderly French woman sitting

00:24:56.420 --> 00:24:59.970
in the middle threw
such an indignant glance

00:24:59.970 --> 00:25:02.730
at her that BiBi hesitated.

00:25:02.730 --> 00:25:05.980
She was only going to sit on
the corner, but the woman seemed

00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:08.690
to think she was intended
upon a takeover

00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:11.330
and making a bid for independence.

00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:14.210
She was only wearing scarf,

00:25:14.210 --> 00:25:18.060
duty free as a protection
against frizzy hair.

00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:21.860
But this apparently made
a French colony of her.

00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:26.780
She pushed the scarf back
carefully and tried to smile.

00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:30.030
But the French woman
looked pointedly away.

00:25:30.030 --> 00:25:31.330
She had blue tinted hair

00:25:31.330 --> 00:25:34.410
that obviously did not frizz
although she may have used the same

00:25:34.410 --> 00:25:36.730
hairdresser as BiBi.

00:25:36.730 --> 00:25:42.110
She gave off the air of
stale cologne and disapproval

00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:45.550
as BiBi John sat gingerly
down, half-way --

00:25:45.550 --> 00:25:50.960
sat gingerly down beside her
feeling foreign and resigned.

00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:54.080 position:56%
There was nowhere else to sit anyway
given the pile of pigeon droppings

00:25:54.080 --> 00:26:00.160 position:56%
at the other end of the bench, so
much for her hope of meeting people.

00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:04.100
Bon jour she nodded
timidly at her neighbor.

00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:06.530
It sound like "Bon Jour".

00:26:06.530 --> 00:26:09.370
She couldn't even get
a handle on the accent.

00:26:09.370 --> 00:26:12.130
The French woman turned
slightly away ignoring her.

00:26:12.130 --> 00:26:15.680
In fact, she looked rather
nervous as well as disapproving

00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:19.560
and who could blame her trapped in
the middle of a seesaw of a bench

00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:24.090
with an elderly lady and her
headscarf sitting at one end

00:26:24.090 --> 00:26:27.800
and a pile of pigeon
droppings at the other.

00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:31.740
She sighs because she's thinking
about her daughters and the fact

00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:36.300
that she's a burden on
them, and she sighs again.

00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:41.000
Her French neighbor with tinted
hair flinched at the sigh.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.390
It was clearly intolerable
to hear a foreigner sigh,

00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:46.810
not only once but twice.

00:26:46.810 --> 00:26:50.600
And she must have interpreted it as
a criticism towards the Republic,

00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:55.490
for she rose abruptly at
that moment and moved away.

00:26:55.490 --> 00:26:59.080
BiBi was flustered but
she wanted to apologize,

00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:00.380
but didn't have the words.

00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:06.040 position:56%
It was useless anyway because of her
accent and the lack of vocabulary.

00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:11.410 position:56%
"Oh ravah" she called out faintly as
the French woman turned on her heel

00:27:11.410 --> 00:27:13.520
and ground across the gravel.

00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:17.520
But it was clear from the woman's
enraged back as she stopped

00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:21.630
on towards the gate that the
effort towards reconciliation

00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:25.630
and politess had not been enough".

00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:28.150
You realize in the
course of the story

00:27:28.150 --> 00:27:29.810
that it is not only the foreigners,

00:27:29.810 --> 00:27:35.680
however that treat the
Iranians as other, as them.

00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:41.650
It is the Iranians themselves
that treat each other as them.

00:27:41.650 --> 00:27:47.730
And many times it's the Iranians
who treat the foreigners as them.

00:27:47.730 --> 00:27:52.830
We have circles and circles of us
and them in the Iranian community

00:27:52.830 --> 00:27:57.300
and I thought it might make you
laugh just a change of voice

00:27:57.300 --> 00:28:02.200 position:56%
to hear the wee voice
interrupting the story of BiBi John.

00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:05.630
And telling you from the
point of view of a mother

00:28:05.630 --> 00:28:11.460
in law what she thinks
of her daughters in law.

00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:14.000
"We have both kinds in our family.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.470 position:56%
The Eastern ones and the Westerners.

00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:21.040
And we can promise you the first
lot caused all the problems.

00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:22.720
Getting into moods at every moment,

00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:25.050
taking offense at the
drop of a hate.

00:28:25.050 --> 00:28:28.750
Forever overreacting to
inferences, inventing reasons

00:28:28.750 --> 00:28:31.700
to be hurt or assuming that we are.

00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:36.350
So sensitive you can't say a thing
to them without risking insult.

00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:40.420
Communicating with the [Inaudible]
girls, that is the foreigners.

00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:45.400
It's frankly much easier with them
at least you know where you are,

00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:47.290
in spite of the language barrier.

00:28:47.290 --> 00:28:49.350
It's straightforward, it's blunt.

00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:54.010
They say exactly what they mean,
everything is cut and dried

00:28:54.010 --> 00:28:58.610
with them, but with our Persian
daughters in law, God help us.

00:28:58.610 --> 00:29:01.370
We have to walk on
eggs the whole time

00:29:01.370 --> 00:29:04.870
and imagine all the
things they aren't saying.

00:29:04.870 --> 00:29:10.090
In some ways it's a blessing
of course, it's an advantage

00:29:10.090 --> 00:29:14.450
that the harangues don't always
understand what we're saying.

00:29:14.450 --> 00:29:17.930
You know what we mean, at least
there's no harangues with them,

00:29:17.930 --> 00:29:22.240
no endless compliments, no
twisting into insistent knots

00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:24.990
to say what you don't
actually believe.

00:29:24.990 --> 00:29:27.690
There's none of that
with the foreigners.

00:29:27.690 --> 00:29:30.860
But in other ways it's hurtful too.

00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:34.730
You know they can be quite
tactless at times and take candor

00:29:34.730 --> 00:29:38.860
to such an extreme that you wonder
whether they lack imagination

00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:40.960
or are simply stupid.

00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:44.900
No courtesies, no compliments,
everything at face value.

00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:49.650
A no is a no and a yes
means they should fix it.

00:29:49.650 --> 00:29:52.840
Fixing things is what
harangues are good at.

00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:54.280
But that's where it ends.

00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:57.300
There you are half blind,
feeling for your cane

00:29:57.300 --> 00:30:00.400 position:56%
and they ask "Do you need anything"?

00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:02.790
And of course you say, "No".

00:30:02.790 --> 00:30:04.490
And it doesn't go one inch further.

00:30:04.490 --> 00:30:08.120
Of course they bend and pick the
cane up for you when it clatters

00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:10.450
to the floor, that's not the point.

00:30:10.450 --> 00:30:13.630
But then they go off
with a peck on the cheek

00:30:13.630 --> 00:30:17.070
and a cheerful good bye dumping
you for the rest of the afternoon

00:30:17.070 --> 00:30:25.160
as if the cane was really all
that you're not asking for".

00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:32.330
Well how can I tell you a little
bit more about this story?

00:30:32.330 --> 00:30:36.060
It could be that you may
have looked on the blog site

00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:40.370
for Stanford University Press and
you may find there are several

00:30:40.370 --> 00:30:43.470
of the chapters that I've
already read on that,

00:30:43.470 --> 00:30:44.940
and that could be intersting.

00:30:44.940 --> 00:30:47.050
But there is one that I didn't read

00:30:47.050 --> 00:30:51.200
and I might just quickly
give you a taste of that.

00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:55.060
And that's in the -- towards
the end of the book again,

00:30:55.060 --> 00:31:02.470
when we have a section on
marriages or weddings, excuse me.

00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:09.240
I should have put my little stick
it things on this, but I didn't.

00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:11.410
Oh maybe even this would be better.

00:31:11.410 --> 00:31:13.620
This is a little bit
about a reflection

00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:16.450
on why I've used this
structure in fact

00:31:16.450 --> 00:31:20.270
and it's a small chapter
called "Losing the Plot".

00:31:20.270 --> 00:31:23.570
And it's about the way in
which Iranians write stories.

00:31:23.570 --> 00:31:27.440
You know we've got great
tradition of poetry in Iran.

00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:33.260
We've also got a most fascinating
tradition in passion plays

00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:38.980
but we don't' necessarily have the
same tradition in novel writing.

00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:43.720
We don't' have that wonderful
western psychological realism

00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:47.530
tradition which we have learned
because we're good at imitating.

00:31:47.530 --> 00:31:50.360
There's a chapter in this
book called "Imitation"

00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:52.700
about the way we know
how to imitate.

00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:57.670
But we have borrowed the
psychological realism structure

00:31:57.670 --> 00:31:58.970
of the novel.

00:31:58.970 --> 00:32:02.050
It doesn't come natural
to the person psyche

00:32:02.050 --> 00:32:09.170
and in this chapter called "Losing
the plot" I explore that idea.

00:32:09.170 --> 00:32:14.910
"The old film ended as such
films do with a drum roll

00:32:14.910 --> 00:32:18.090
of a sunset, or was it a sun rise?

00:32:18.090 --> 00:32:23.660
Which faded into the
chant of an opening rose.

00:32:23.660 --> 00:32:26.140
It was a splendid climax.

00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:30.950
We liked the grand finale
of a sunset or a sunrise.

00:32:30.950 --> 00:32:33.440
We love a film resolving in a rose,

00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:36.520
all our fears melt
with that lovely image.

00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:40.280
All our hopes blossom
with that stirring sound.

00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:43.150
There is something
characteristically Persian,

00:32:43.150 --> 00:32:46.290
classically Iranian
about those symbols.

00:32:46.290 --> 00:32:48.980
You really can't go wrong with
them as far as we're concerned.

00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:54.350
Of course there is the reed
too, the other metaphor of ours,

00:32:54.350 --> 00:32:57.230
yes we can't do without the reed.

00:32:57.230 --> 00:32:59.880
More anguished than the rose.

00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:03.910
More visceral than the
sunset, expressive of suffering

00:33:03.910 --> 00:33:08.620
of martyrdom, of existential
pain in the old poems,

00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:15.720 position:56%
rude hangs grasped me, slashed me to
the core, brute fingers plucked me

00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:18.200
from the soft river floor.

00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:22.890
Such images are appropriate to our
heritage, our religion our history.

00:33:22.890 --> 00:33:27.850 position:56%
They recall the anguish and ardor of
the nightingale that ultimate icon

00:33:27.850 --> 00:33:30.080
of our culture and our art.

00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:34.000
They remind us that the golden
lion on who's back the son

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:40.630
of the old regime rose and set bore
a loft of curved and cruel symatog.

00:33:40.630 --> 00:33:44.070
We're referring to the
older regime naturally,

00:33:44.070 --> 00:33:46.970
the regime of the 19th century.

00:33:46.970 --> 00:33:53.180 position:56%
The one before the one most people
now call old, or rather what we used

00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:58.450
to call old before we
became it ourselves.

00:33:58.450 --> 00:34:03.840
Persians think, people think
that Persians are good at plots.

00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:07.090
They think we are masters
of storytelling, the then

00:34:07.090 --> 00:34:12.110
and the and then of charizod.

00:34:12.110 --> 00:34:16.110
But it's not metaphorical
logic we prefer.

00:34:16.110 --> 00:34:21.630
Metaphors are our forte, we love
the way metaphors and similes shift

00:34:21.630 --> 00:34:27.400
and change, ignoring consequence
reversing temporal direction.

00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:31.170
Conspiracy theories we have no
trouble with, but we are not so hot

00:34:31.170 --> 00:34:35.000
on plot, at least in
the narrative sense.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:41.740 position:56%
What we look for in the film are the
roses and the sunsets, and the reed.

00:34:41.740 --> 00:34:44.970
My skin they fluid until I was raw.

00:34:44.970 --> 00:34:48.960
My lips they split, my
throat they cruelly tore".

00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:53.990
I won't go on because that's
just a taste of this book

00:34:53.990 --> 00:34:59.080
and it's also an apologies for
why I haven't fitted the brand

00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:03.920
of a normal novel telling you
the psychological realistic story

00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:06.790
of one individual all the
way through to the end.

00:35:06.790 --> 00:35:10.520
This is a story about a
family and a fractured family.

00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:14.770
It's a story about a whole
culture that has been scattered

00:35:14.770 --> 00:35:16.830
and fractured across the planet.

00:35:16.830 --> 00:35:20.270
And I do hope that in reading it
you might find something in it

00:35:20.270 --> 00:35:22.310
that you also associate with.

00:35:22.310 --> 00:35:27.280
I came across a marvelous
statement by Mossan Hamid,

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:31.350
the writer of the reluctant
fundamentalist who has also come

00:35:31.350 --> 00:35:34.320
out with a fascinating
book called Exit West,

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:38.220
on migrants which maybe you
have on your library shelves.

00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:42.470
He said, "even people who stay
in the same place undergo a kind

00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:47.260
of migration through time,
everyone is a migrant".

00:35:47.260 --> 00:35:50.320
And I do hope that this
book really does appeal

00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:54.090
to many other kinds of groups.

00:35:54.090 --> 00:35:59.120
Aminatta Forna, the marvelous Siera
Leonian Scotts writer I mentioned

00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:00.790
says something about branding,

00:36:00.790 --> 00:36:02.900
which I thought would
be useful to remember.

00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:06.820
Sometimes she says, we
need labels just to be able

00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:09.190
to describe the thing
we're talking about,

00:36:09.190 --> 00:36:13.020
but labels confirm the
limitations of language

00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:16.400
and when they are overused
they become limiting.

00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:21.210
And perhaps the last quote
I could use for today is one

00:36:21.210 --> 00:36:27.450
from marvels Marilyn
Robinson who I greatly revere.

00:36:27.450 --> 00:36:32.610
"When people draw a bright line
between us and then", she writes,

00:36:32.610 --> 00:36:35.200
"Those on the other side
of the line are assumed

00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:38.180
to be unworthy of respect
or hearing.

00:36:38.180 --> 00:36:42.870
And are in fact regarded
as a huge problem to the us

00:36:42.870 --> 00:36:45.310
who presume to judge them.

00:36:45.310 --> 00:36:49.960
When this assumption takes hold,
the definition of community hardens

00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:54.230
and becomes violently
exclusive and defensive.

00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:59.070
Definitions of us and them begin
to contract and as they shrink

00:36:59.070 --> 00:37:05.320
and narrow becoming increasingly
inflamed or dangerous and inhumane,

00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:09.770
this tedious pattern has
repeated itself endlessly

00:37:09.770 --> 00:37:11.460
through human history.

00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:17.690
And it is the end of community
and the beginning of tribalism".

00:37:17.690 --> 00:37:22.180 position:56%
I think we're all quite aware of
the fact that we're living at a time

00:37:22.180 --> 00:37:26.680
when those definitions have
contracted, have hardened,

00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:32.130
are producing notions of narrowness
that divide us from one another.

00:37:32.130 --> 00:37:36.650
And this has happened before
and we've known it in history

00:37:36.650 --> 00:37:41.270
and we have noticed that when there
is that recoil that retraction,

00:37:41.270 --> 00:37:46.990
that reaction against being open
it is inevitably followed by a kind

00:37:46.990 --> 00:37:51.650
of turning of the tide and the
wave comes rolling back again

00:37:51.650 --> 00:37:55.450
and we find ourselves
being far more inclusive,

00:37:55.450 --> 00:37:57.960
it was a recoil in the 30's.

00:37:57.960 --> 00:38:01.380
It was an expansion again
after the second World War.

00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:03.650
I hope we don't have
to have another war

00:38:03.650 --> 00:38:08.920 position:56%
but the recoil is certainly building
up to a Tsunami type proportion now.

00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:11.820
I can only hope that we will reach

00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:14.360
out to each other even
more as a result.

00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:16.810
Certainly the recoil
has been repeated

00:38:16.810 --> 00:38:22.130
but so has the positive reaction
to it, the desire to be inclusive.

00:38:22.130 --> 00:38:28.490 position:56%
If my book can promote that movement
even slightly, I will be grateful.

00:38:28.490 --> 00:38:32.140
And very grateful indeed to have
this opportunity to talk to you.

00:38:32.140 --> 00:38:33.940
Thank you.

00:38:33.940 --> 00:38:50.280
[ Applause ]

00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:51.580
&gt;&gt; Hirad Dinavari: Thank you
very much Dr. Nakhjavani.

00:38:51.580 --> 00:38:53.070
We have some opportunity
for questions.

00:38:53.070 --> 00:38:55.650
Mary-Jane has a question
for you, go ahead.

00:38:55.650 --> 00:39:11.240
&gt;&gt; I want to thank you so
much, it was a very, very --

00:39:11.240 --> 00:39:15.500
it was a fascinating
book presentation.

00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:24.660
I am wondering, I wonder
what you think

00:39:24.660 --> 00:39:31.580
about another way of
looking at labeling.

00:39:31.580 --> 00:39:37.900
Is it a way also, in
addition to explaining

00:39:37.900 --> 00:39:42.360 position:56%
that which is not easily understood?

00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:48.810
Because if you have a label you
can add all kind of attitudes

00:39:48.810 --> 00:39:53.030 position:56%
and all kinds of values [Inaudible].

00:39:53.030 --> 00:39:58.170
Just explain the other who is
not, who doesn't fit into one

00:39:58.170 --> 00:40:00.560
of the categories that
us or the other.

00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:01.860
&gt;&gt; Bahiyyih Nakhjavani: Yes.

00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:07.860
&gt;&gt; So can it be also a lazy
way of saying "Why do I have

00:40:07.860 --> 00:40:10.720
to understand that person"?

00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:15.170
I can just [Inaudible] and then
I don't need to understand.

00:40:15.170 --> 00:40:17.510
&gt;&gt; Bahiyyih Nakhjavani: I
think you're absolutely right.

00:40:17.510 --> 00:40:19.950
It's an easy shorthand.

00:40:19.950 --> 00:40:21.290
It's a form of shorthand.

00:40:21.290 --> 00:40:23.610
It doesn't have to be nefarious.

00:40:23.610 --> 00:40:27.080
It's got a kind of innocence to it.

00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:29.090
A substitute for explaining.

00:40:29.090 --> 00:40:32.380 position:56%
but I think that it's been exploited
and it's been used to divide.

00:40:32.380 --> 00:40:36.460
And I think that's also been in
some ways the act of separation

00:40:36.460 --> 00:40:40.980
and distinctiveness of our
identities in terms of culture;

00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:48.370
in terms of gender have been a
necessary process for our society.

00:40:48.370 --> 00:40:51.520
We've been thrown in into
each other's laps in a way

00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:52.900
that never happened before.

00:40:52.900 --> 00:40:56.810
We were always in our little
bubbles until war and colonialism

00:40:56.810 --> 00:41:00.430
and expansion of empire
and exploitation

00:41:00.430 --> 00:41:04.720
of differences have forced
us to confront each other.

00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:10.240
And with the 20th century I
think we find ourselves jostling

00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:14.450
in these conditions trying to
figure out where do I belong?

00:41:14.450 --> 00:41:17.480
So it's been a -- I've always
thought of it as a process

00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:23.290
of adolescence that we're
having to go through.

00:41:23.290 --> 00:41:29.120
As adolescents we need to define
ourselves from our families,

00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:33.760
from our siblings to distinguish
ourselves as individuals.

00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:42.830
It's very healthy to do
so and I think we have,

00:41:42.830 --> 00:41:47.970
and are in the process
of doing that.

00:41:47.970 --> 00:42:00.230
But I think you can
see the beginning signs

00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:08.450
of where it becomes what
Marilyn Robinson is describing

00:42:08.450 --> 00:42:18.190
and then the laziness becomes
dangerous and then we begin to need

00:42:18.190 --> 00:42:28.160
to question how far we can push
that, how far we can let it just go

00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:38.390 position:56%
because we need to have more of the
unites while keeping our distinction

00:42:38.390 --> 00:42:40.550
than more that differentiates, yes.

00:42:40.550 --> 00:42:41.970
Yes please.

00:42:41.970 --> 00:42:50.980
&gt;&gt; I just finished an article
[Inaudible] it's one of the things

00:42:50.980 --> 00:42:53.610
as you were just speaking
that I wondered about.

00:42:53.610 --> 00:43:01.410
There's the question of who
is defining universal, right?

00:43:01.410 --> 00:43:05.700
It's the branding, if there
is this universal is it an

00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:07.320
expansive universal?

00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:13.140
Or is it universal that is
like the colonial powers

00:43:13.140 --> 00:43:20.350
of understanding the universal and
then how do people react to that?

00:43:20.350 --> 00:43:27.120
And one of the ideas that I was
reading about that as I was working

00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:32.580
on this encyclopedia article, I'm
curious whether this rings true

00:43:32.580 --> 00:43:37.300
in some way, not as a good thing
but like accurate description is

00:43:37.300 --> 00:43:43.310
that part of what you're struggling
with his how to retain a sense

00:43:43.310 --> 00:43:48.460 position:56%
of a cultural identify from whatever
piece of the bubble mattered.

00:43:48.460 --> 00:43:53.400
In this new place consumption,
and therefore marketing,

00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:57.100
is it really easy quantifiable
way to do it?

00:43:57.100 --> 00:44:01.730
I can -- I don't know
I am the daughter

00:44:01.730 --> 00:44:05.470
of the [Inaudible]
daughter in law, right?

00:44:05.470 --> 00:44:12.690
And so I can be here in my mother's
culture except when I want to put

00:44:12.690 --> 00:44:14.010
on a [Inaudible] or
something like that,

00:44:14.010 --> 00:44:17.590
and a piece of my father's
culture and wear it.

00:44:17.590 --> 00:44:21.270
Until I want to take
it off again, right?

00:44:21.270 --> 00:44:25.390
So that I can go back to being
and that would be true too

00:44:25.390 --> 00:44:28.550
if I weren't the daughter of
a [Inaudible] daughter in law.

00:44:28.550 --> 00:44:33.240
If I were one of my
cousins, two immigrants.

00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:37.370 position:56%
It's this way and it doesn't really
work because it's not necessarily --

00:44:37.370 --> 00:44:40.160
but I'm wondering if that
makes sense, push and pull?

00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:41.460
&gt;&gt; Bahiyyih Nakhjavani: Yes,

00:44:41.460 --> 00:44:44.760
well I think what you're describing
is something all immigrants have

00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:48.550 position:56%
done putting the hat on, taking it
off, wearing this costume when we're

00:44:48.550 --> 00:44:51.530
in this group, taking it
off when we're in another.

00:44:51.530 --> 00:44:56.110 position:56%
But I do believe wholeheartedly in
the organic process of civilization.

00:44:56.110 --> 00:45:00.490
I think the human species has
extraordinary capacities to absorb

00:45:00.490 --> 00:45:05.910
and to maybe it's because I look at
what the English language has done.

00:45:05.910 --> 00:45:09.080
It is an absorbing process
that happens in language.

00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:11.870
And that is an extension
of the human mind.

00:45:11.870 --> 00:45:17.820
It's what's going up on here in
the neurons, the new patterns

00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:19.530
and pathways that we're creating.

00:45:19.530 --> 00:45:23.710
The English language has this way
of sucking in all the differences.

00:45:23.710 --> 00:45:29.820
There is no universal culture that
is imposing itself on the new word.

00:45:29.820 --> 00:45:34.720
It is that word that is influencing
the use of language as a whole.

00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:38.600
And so I don't think it's either
you get imposed upon or you impose.

00:45:38.600 --> 00:45:41.610
I think there is an organic
process going on here,

00:45:41.610 --> 00:45:44.740
and I think the artificial
divisions of colonialism

00:45:44.740 --> 00:45:47.390
and even industrialization
and commodify --

00:45:47.390 --> 00:45:50.090
these are artificial
processes to buy and sell.

00:45:50.090 --> 00:45:54.110
There is a buyer and a seller, so
as long as we can shift the focus

00:45:54.110 --> 00:45:57.200
so that everybody is selling
and everybody is buying,

00:45:57.200 --> 00:45:59.060 position:56%
you know if we're going to use that
metaphor, it has to be more organic.

00:45:59.060 --> 00:46:00.360
It has to flow across
the boundaries.

00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:01.660
I wrote a chapter in
here about assimilation,

00:46:01.660 --> 00:46:02.960
it's called "Assimilation" and
it starts off with a new comer

00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:04.260
from Iran, confronting
Iranians who have been

00:46:04.260 --> 00:46:05.560
out of the country for a long time.

00:46:05.560 --> 00:46:06.860
And when she first
comes she's very anxious

00:46:06.860 --> 00:46:08.160
to be accepted by the old comers.

00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:09.460
So she's trying very hard to
be terribly modern and secular

00:46:09.460 --> 00:46:10.760
and disregarding what is in
Iran and identifying herself

00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:12.060 position:56%
as totally atheist and
non-connected with Islam as it were.

00:46:12.060 --> 00:46:13.360
And as the story progresses,

00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:14.660
I don't want to give the
game away completely.

00:46:14.660 --> 00:46:15.960
But we see the shift
in her assimilation

00:46:15.960 --> 00:46:17.260
and we see her assimilation
affecting the fact that she's

00:46:17.260 --> 00:46:18.560
out of the country,
is affecting her.

00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:19.860
It's affecting her
interlocutors as well.

00:46:19.860 --> 00:46:21.160
Their position is being affected
by her reactions to begin abroad.

00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:22.460
And so it's that osmosis
which I think is interesting

00:46:22.460 --> 00:46:23.760
and the constant reminder that
we are not mechanical creatures,

00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:25.060
we are not parts of some
artificial organism.

00:46:25.060 --> 00:46:26.360
We are an organism,
we're not man made.

00:46:26.360 --> 00:46:27.660
We have the capacity to
change extraordinarily

00:46:27.660 --> 00:46:28.960
and to affect change.

00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:30.260
So I don't know who the
universal us is going to be.

00:46:30.260 --> 00:46:31.560
I don't know what the universal
language is going to be.

00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:32.860
I hope it's a little bit more
interesting than Globish is

00:46:32.860 --> 00:46:34.160 position:56%
at the moment, you know what I mean?

00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:35.460
I have hope that we can
perhaps enrich rather

00:46:35.460 --> 00:46:36.760
than impoverish who we are.

00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:38.560
&gt;&gt; Quick comments and
then a question.

00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:45.040
[ Inaudible ]

00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:46.750
&gt;&gt; The second thing
I was going to say

00:46:46.750 --> 00:46:50.270
in many ways what you were
describing is a universal feeling

00:46:50.270 --> 00:46:56.290
not just particularly in the
acceptance of people in France.

00:46:56.290 --> 00:46:59.970
Everybody who has gone to
France has undergone that.

00:46:59.970 --> 00:47:01.270
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.

00:47:01.270 --> 00:47:06.520
&gt;&gt; I know they pretend like they
don't understand what I'm saying

00:47:06.520 --> 00:47:11.070
and look at me quizzically.

00:47:11.070 --> 00:47:14.940
But I have a question
that I've always wondered.

00:47:14.940 --> 00:47:22.000
I have a lot of Iranian friends
who only associate themselves

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:27.120
with begin Persian but not being
Iranian, what is that phenomenon

00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:33.610
where they're not associating with
the country but with a culture?

00:47:33.610 --> 00:47:35.950 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Bahiyyih Nakhjavani: Well
somebody asked me that same question

00:47:35.950 --> 00:47:38.920
when I was in San Francisco
and it really is interesting

00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:42.310
that we've subdivided
Iran and Persia.

00:47:42.310 --> 00:47:44.450
But bear in mind that
Persia was also the name

00:47:44.450 --> 00:47:46.550
of the country before it --

00:47:46.550 --> 00:47:51.060
there have been fluctuations in
the historical naming of this land.

00:47:51.060 --> 00:47:54.520
I don't know, I think
the people who prefer

00:47:54.520 --> 00:47:57.510
to call themselves Persian are
making a branding statement

00:47:57.510 --> 00:48:01.120
about their non-identification
with the present regime.

00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:03.260
I mean people have
all kinds of reasons

00:48:03.260 --> 00:48:07.090
for why they put symboline
on their left breast.

00:48:07.090 --> 00:48:12.120
I went through a period where
I liked being called Persian.

00:48:12.120 --> 00:48:16.690
Because I liked the sound and I
remember the little pink country

00:48:16.690 --> 00:48:19.750
on the map when I was growing
up and it was called Persia,

00:48:19.750 --> 00:48:23.670
but it wasn't necessarily
for political reasons.

00:48:23.670 --> 00:48:27.380
But I think you're right we
associate the word Persia

00:48:27.380 --> 00:48:32.350
with nightingales, roses,
music, literature and we imagine

00:48:32.350 --> 00:48:34.700
that Iran does not mean that.

00:48:34.700 --> 00:48:37.990
But that similarly come
across young Iranians

00:48:37.990 --> 00:48:40.620
and very often they're young,
not necessarily only young

00:48:40.620 --> 00:48:44.760
but who are very very
patriotic about the word Iran

00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:48.030
and the greatness of
Iran and the glory

00:48:48.030 --> 00:48:50.010
of the past civilization so Iran.

00:48:50.010 --> 00:48:54.380
So they were also being proudly
Iranian and it had nothing

00:48:54.380 --> 00:48:55.710
to do with the present regime.

00:48:55.710 --> 00:48:58.040
So I think it really
depends on the temperament,

00:48:58.040 --> 00:49:01.060
the personality whoever
it happens to be.

00:49:01.060 --> 00:49:05.300
We're always looking for identity
and this is the whole issue.

00:49:05.300 --> 00:49:09.420
Is our identity actually
helping others also be included

00:49:09.420 --> 00:49:13.300
or are we making a statement that
excludes or is this just a phase

00:49:13.300 --> 00:49:16.410
or you know it's all good,
it's all good so long

00:49:16.410 --> 00:49:24.510
as it doesn't make us feel
nervous about anybody.

00:49:24.510 --> 00:49:43.040
[ Inaudible ]

00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:49.270 position:56%
&gt;&gt; People kind of label to what they
[Inaudible] Now if you actually look

00:49:49.270 --> 00:49:52.430
on those books, there are
minute shades of differences

00:49:52.430 --> 00:49:55.880
across the meaning of
those books on the shelf.

00:49:55.880 --> 00:50:00.890
And this would be true of
yours, it covers a unique slice.

00:50:00.890 --> 00:50:05.180
this is what I think is interesting
about this whole process.

00:50:05.180 --> 00:50:15.120
Is that I'm kind of a
[Inaudible] Iranians like yours,

00:50:15.120 --> 00:50:19.500
you're Iranian you
must like mirrors.

00:50:19.500 --> 00:50:20.800
Wrong?

00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:22.100
&gt;&gt; Wrong.

00:50:22.100 --> 00:50:26.910
&gt;&gt; But you get into
these problems and that's

00:50:26.910 --> 00:50:34.970
where I think there's
some kind of conflict

00:50:37.590 --> 00:50:42.480
and I don't' know how
you see this with the,

00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:44.590
I think you address it
well in the beauty parlor

00:50:44.590 --> 00:50:48.800
or this person perceives
some kind of other and does'

00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:51.720
like it because of the labeling.

00:50:51.720 --> 00:50:53.050
&gt;&gt; Bahiyyih Nakhjavani:
Well I think the labeling;

00:50:53.050 --> 00:50:55.990
I myself have been
constantly shifting

00:50:55.990 --> 00:50:59.640
around not knowing
how to be branded.

00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:02.950
I mean I get branded
by the publisher,

00:51:02.950 --> 00:51:06.150
you know they want to
fix the label on you.

00:51:06.150 --> 00:51:09.060
The women who read too much
suddenly became a feminist novel.

00:51:09.060 --> 00:51:12.170
Or I become an Iranian
writer because I happen

00:51:12.170 --> 00:51:14.470
to be speaking about Iran.

00:51:14.470 --> 00:51:17.410
And I think the genre of
categories in book shops force you

00:51:17.410 --> 00:51:20.400
into these little pockets
and this is something,

00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:21.910
this is a new phenomena.

00:51:21.910 --> 00:51:24.290
This is about trying
desperately to sell books.

00:51:24.290 --> 00:51:28.920
150 years ago we never
had these categorizations.

00:51:28.920 --> 00:51:33.890
We were just trying to write,
and writing about what we knew.

00:51:33.890 --> 00:51:37.880
Can you imagine Jane
Austin being labeled?

00:51:37.880 --> 00:51:41.610
First of all she would have cringed
at the thought of being identified

00:51:41.610 --> 00:51:45.260
on a market shelf, but I think
this is something that we have

00:51:45.260 --> 00:51:47.970
to question because
it goes very deep

00:51:47.970 --> 00:51:52.360
into our politics how money
is influencing our choices

00:51:52.360 --> 00:51:56.980
of who we are, who we elect, what
kind of country we want to have.

00:51:56.980 --> 00:51:59.130
It's so profoundly
deep in our society,

00:51:59.130 --> 00:52:00.430
everywhere including France.

00:52:00.430 --> 00:52:02.230
So yeah.

00:52:02.230 --> 00:53:34.130
[ Inaudible ]

00:53:34.130 --> 00:53:35.430
&gt;&gt; Bahiyyih Nakhjavani:
I'm so glad you said

00:53:35.430 --> 00:53:39.150
that because economics is
fundamental to this story

00:53:39.150 --> 00:53:43.870
and you see people who have had a
great deal, who lose everything.

00:53:43.870 --> 00:53:48.640
And people how have a great deal
but don't feel connected to those

00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:51.880
that don't have in this community.

00:53:51.880 --> 00:53:54.060
And I particularly
wanted to look at the way

00:53:54.060 --> 00:54:00.840
in which people how have had a lot
and lose everything, react to that.

00:54:00.840 --> 00:54:05.890 position:56%
Some who spend the rest of their
lives in mourning and in lamentation

00:54:05.890 --> 00:54:07.810
for what could have
been and what was.

00:54:07.810 --> 00:54:13.420 position:56%
And others who pull themselves up by
their socks and become something new

00:54:13.420 --> 00:54:18.470
and create a new creation
out of themselves as a result

00:54:18.470 --> 00:54:23.010
of this deprivation and this loss
and shaping up and separation

00:54:23.010 --> 00:54:24.880
from all that is familiar.

00:54:24.880 --> 00:54:28.200
and in particular I've
been fascinated by how

00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:29.500
that affects the women here.

00:54:29.500 --> 00:54:31.250
I hope that doesn't
make me a feminist,

00:54:31.250 --> 00:54:34.180
but I really have been interested

00:54:34.180 --> 00:54:38.480
because in traditional Iranian
society women especially

00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:43.170
in the wealthy sector were
ornaments and were there

00:54:43.170 --> 00:54:46.900
to grace the lapel of the family.

00:54:46.900 --> 00:54:51.580
But when they find themselves
deprived of everything and end

00:54:51.580 --> 00:54:56.290
up working in a supermarket
and through toil

00:54:56.290 --> 00:55:01.470 position:56%
and hard work getting their kids
raised, that's strength of character

00:55:01.470 --> 00:55:04.940
and that's reality in who they are.

00:55:04.940 --> 00:55:08.440
It's not their brand, it's
their strength and side.

00:55:08.440 --> 00:55:12.690
And I was hoping to break
through the us and them in order

00:55:12.690 --> 00:55:14.760
to show that inner strength.

00:55:14.760 --> 00:55:20.070
This is a book called us
and them with the connected

00:55:20.070 --> 00:55:22.030
in the middle of us and them.

00:55:22.030 --> 00:55:28.240
It's not us vs. them,
it's not us or them.

00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:33.930 position:56%
It's not even us, gap, and gap them.

00:55:33.930 --> 00:55:38.480
It's us and them.

00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:42.460
So I hope that that new word

00:55:42.460 --> 00:55:48.410
that combines the two illustrates
the sort of strength that we need

00:55:48.410 --> 00:55:53.090
to rise above these and to
bring together the extremes

00:55:57.240 --> 00:56:01.540
that are pulling societies apart.

00:56:01.540 --> 00:56:03.340
Yeah.

00:56:03.340 --> 00:56:42.190
[ Inaudible ]

00:56:42.190 --> 00:56:43.960 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Bahiyyih Nakhjavani: Exactly and
that's the beautiful irony you know?

00:56:43.960 --> 00:56:49.370
You find that the deprivation
is actually the opportunity

00:56:49.370 --> 00:56:55.510
for growth sometimes.

00:56:55.510 --> 00:59:14.460
[ Inaudible ]

00:59:14.460 --> 00:59:15.760
&gt;&gt; Bahiyyih Nakhjavani:
That's so interesting.

00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:20.950
First of all I must say
that universal element,

00:59:20.950 --> 00:59:23.780
that rootedness in our identity.

00:59:23.780 --> 00:59:27.760
I played with that through the
metaphor of smells in this book.

00:59:27.760 --> 00:59:30.770
So all the way through you've
got a thread of feno Greek

00:59:30.770 --> 00:59:34.020
and wherever you happen to go
there is Persian [Inaudible]

00:59:34.020 --> 00:59:37.330
and it does not change no matter

00:59:37.330 --> 00:59:39.790
which country you're
in or anything else.

00:59:39.790 --> 00:59:43.760
The symbol of that thing which
keeps us always Persian or Iranian

00:59:43.760 --> 00:59:46.620
but what you said about
Iranian film I think is

00:59:46.620 --> 00:59:48.690
so important and so interesting.

00:59:48.690 --> 00:59:52.950 position:56%
In that chapter that I read a little
bit of called losing the plot,

00:59:52.950 --> 00:59:55.580
at the end of that
chapter because it starts

00:59:55.580 --> 00:59:58.180
if you recall about a film.

00:59:58.180 --> 01:00:03.930
It says the old film ended as most
of these old films do with a sunset

01:00:03.930 --> 01:00:07.810
and a rose and it ends up
talking about modern film,

01:00:07.810 --> 01:00:12.820
modern Iranian film and you realize
that the voice of the we here

01:00:12.820 --> 01:00:17.570
as clearly distinguished in
the beginning that we are old.

01:00:17.570 --> 01:00:24.760 position:56%
The old we has great difficulty with
modern Iranian film, and the reason

01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:29.130
for it is maybe I could just
read one little tiny paragraph

01:00:29.130 --> 01:00:32.840
to clarify what I mean,
or is there no time.

01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:37.120
No time, you have to read the book.

01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:41.000

of the Library of Congress.
