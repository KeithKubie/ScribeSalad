00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:01.710
The other type of bias that we have to

00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:03.700
be careful about is called the, we call it the

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:07.220
approach bias and this bias often shows itself in the

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.150
beginning of a project or the way we approach something.

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:12.390
&gt;&gt; Yeah, we see this all the time when we've run UXD

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:17.520
workshops at IO, and a variety of other venues before, and almost

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.210
9 times out of 10 every developer when, when asked to build

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.380
a pizza ordering application. Thinks about

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.440
a photo realistic pizza ordering widget

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.890
that uses some really nifty graphics API said

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.850
they want to go and build right now.

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:32.390
&gt;&gt; Gosh and I was the one getting hungry.

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.420
But why do you think developers approach it this way?

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.110
&gt;&gt; Well, developers love to code. And when asked to design a pizza

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.560
ordering application, the first thing to think

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.950
about is what graphics API, APIs are

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.230
available on Android. And what other pinch to zoom and 3D, 4D realistic

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.340
things they can implement right now. And they want to get to it right now.

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.740
And honestly, as a developer even when I'm

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:55.060
designing things, in the back of my head.

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.160
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.170
&gt;&gt; I'm always thinking, how do I build this thing? How would you approach it?

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.439
&gt;&gt; Well, as a designer, the way I would approach it is this. I would try to

00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:03.644
imagine a user who's sitting there using their phone

00:01:03.644 --> 00:01:05.921
and they're hungry for pizza. And they pull up

00:01:05.921 --> 00:01:09.122
an application, and they want to go from being hungry

00:01:09.122 --> 00:01:11.801
to being satisfied. And I think about, what is

00:01:11.801 --> 00:01:14.148
the flow I could create in an application that

00:01:14.148 --> 00:01:16.619
would let them go from being hungry to satisfied

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.078
as quickly as possible, with as little friction as possible, and

00:01:20.078 --> 00:01:23.440
make them happy. So that's kind of the pure designer approach.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.520
But the way that we really want to go about this

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.410
is not exactly the developer approach or the designer approach. We want

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.430
to do something that kind of meets in the middle. So,

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.120
as a development minded designer, I think what you would want to

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.810
do is design something really great, empathize with your user, but

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.660
keep constraints in mind and keep the question of whether you can

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:42.760
really build this in mind.

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.150
&gt;&gt; You know, exactly. And another thing is

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.440
you and I are very familiar with software. And

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.360
the way we think about interaction design patterns

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.470
and libraries are not the same as a user.

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:54.720
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.230
&gt;&gt; When we're building things, we have a certain bias, because

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.100
we're so familiar with these tool kits and platforms that we end

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.480
up having assumptions about how somebody will actually use a particular

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.787
widget or a control. And that's not exactly how a [INAUDIBLE] user

00:02:06.787 --> 00:02:07.443
might do it.

00:02:07.443 --> 00:02:09.846
&gt;&gt; Now that we've discussed approach bias, think about the

00:02:09.846 --> 00:02:13.010
most recent project that you've worked on. Think about what you

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.510
did on day one or how you first approached this

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.630
project. Did any of your approaches actually bias the final product?
