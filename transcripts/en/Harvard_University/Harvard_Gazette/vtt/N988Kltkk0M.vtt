The Harvard curling club has been around
for about five or six years. It's a very

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.269
young club. The main goal every year is
to try to make nationals and to do well

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:20.650
in nationals. Last year, we got fourth
place in the nation and nationals which we were

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.970
psyched about. This year we've got lots
more people and there's lots of

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.660
interest so we're excited for what could
happen this year.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.100
In a curling team, you usually have four
people on each team, one person throwing

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.730
the stone at a given time, two people
sweeping and then one person in the back

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.840
to help see where the shot's going and to
tell the sweepers whether to go on and

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:51.460
off. So you have a stone, you use your broom
to stabilize yourself and as you're

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.140
throwing the stone you slide out on your
foot and you release the stone, and then

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.280
you have two people, you know, one person
on each side of the path of the stone

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.619
and they're sweeping to help direct the
shot go whatever direction is needed, and

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.580
then you have one person in the back
who's navigating where the shot should

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.260
go and telling the sweepers to go on and
off.

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.300
It's a great outlet physically, a lot

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.400
of times I can just be doing lots of
problem sets or lots of homework, so it's

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.100
definitely a great distraction from, you
know, the pure stress of an undergraduate

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.400
education.
