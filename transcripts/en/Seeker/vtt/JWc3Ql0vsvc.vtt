00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.790
When you first fall in love, it’s a whirlwind
of crazy emotions and obsession and anxiety.

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:06.770
And then eventually it’s not.

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:14.840
So did you fall out of love or did it turn
into something new?

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:16.380
Hey there loved ones, Julian here for DNews.

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:19.900
If you’ve ever fallen in love, you know
it does all sorts of odd things to you.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.500
Your palms get sweaty, knees weak, arms are
heavy, you tell her you can cook but you can

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:24.750
only make spaghetti.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.500
At first it’s totally exhilarating, then
over time you get more comfortable but no

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.580
less in love.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.900
What’s changed inside your brain?

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.780
Why does young love feel different than old
love?

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.600
Scientists have wondered the same thing, and
they’ve used fMRI machines to peer into

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.260
people’s brains and find out what’s happening
when you first tumble head over heels for

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:43.260
someone.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.490
It turns out love feels so good because it
makes two regions of your brain light up:

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:49.510
the caudate nucleus, and the ventral tegmental
area.

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.680
Both these regions are associated with reward
and pleasure because they’re rich in the

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:54.680
dopamine.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.780
But dopamine isn’t the only neurotransmitter
giving you that distinct, new-love feel.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.460
Oxytocin and vasopressin are mixed into that
mental cocktail too.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.740
Oxytocin is released after sex or with skin-to-skin
contact and produces feelings of contentment

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.579
and security, bringing couples closer together.

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:11.600
Vasopressin is also associated with long-term
bonding.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.639
New love doesn’t just amplify neurotransmitters,
it reduces some too.

00:01:15.639 --> 00:01:19.799
When you’re in that phase, your body releases
the hormone cortisol, also known as the stress

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:20.799
hormone.

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:24.150
As cortisol levels rise in the body, serotonin
levels in the brain go down.

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.020
As a neurotransmitter, serotonin helps relay
messages from one area of the brain to another,

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.899
and Harvard Medical School’s Richard Schwartz
says its depletion causes those intrusive,

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:36.529
maddening thoughts you have when you’re
in the early stages of love.

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:39.030
It’s what causes infatuation and obsession.

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.670
And finally, new love can shut down some neural
pathways altogether, particularly the one

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.539
that connects the nucleus accumbens to the
amygdala.

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:50.689
That pathway is associated with fear and social
judgment, and helps us make critical assessments

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:51.689
of people.

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.700
Ever fallen in love with someone who was objectively
terrible, and then later wondered why you

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:56.700
didn’t see it?

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:57.759
Now you know why.

00:01:57.759 --> 00:01:59.960
Over time, some of these chemical levels change.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.159
Your body stops pumping out cortisol and your
serotonin levels come back up.

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:06.840
That’s why that anxiety goes away and you
stop worrying about how you look or if you’re

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.119
coming off as too needy.

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.760
And you actually become less needy because
the higher levels of serotonin make you less

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.760
obsessive.

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.510
Your brain and body are less stressed and
you stop feeling that manic craving for your

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:17.510
romantic partner.

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.040
But that doesn’t mean you can’t be madly
in love with someone, even after decades.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.129
Since oxytocin levels are boosted after sex,
those can be brought back up at any time with

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:26.200
a roll in the hay.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.590
Other neurotransmitter levels can remain constant.

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.290
A 2011 study by Stony Brook University compared
the brain activity of couples who had just

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.140
fallen in love to couples that had been married
for 21 years on average.

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.110
Those dopamine centers in the brain associated
with reward and pleasure were just as rich

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.250
in the older couples as the new ones.

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.180
So over time, they had gotten more comfortable
but still felt just as happy.

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.709

Thanks to Kay Jewelers for sponsoring this
episode.

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.640
For 100 years, every kiss begins with K.

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.020
You may not be in a relationship right now
but still want to feel some of that touchy-feely

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.020
goodness.

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.280
