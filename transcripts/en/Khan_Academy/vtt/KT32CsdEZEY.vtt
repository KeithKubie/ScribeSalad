00:00:00.145 --> 00:00:01.520
What I want to do
with this video

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:05.820
is do a quick proof that if
we take a rational number,

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:11.220
and we multiply it times
an irrational number,

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:17.712
that this is going to give
us an irrational number.

00:00:17.712 --> 00:00:19.670
And I encourage you to
actually pause the video

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:21.160
and try to think if you
can prove this on your own.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.201
And I'll give you a hint.

00:00:22.201 --> 00:00:25.690
You can prove it by a proof
through contradiction.

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:28.240
Assume that a rational
times an irrational

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.750
gets you a rational number, and
then see by manipulating it,

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.980
whether you can establish that
all of a sudden this irrational

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.484
number must somehow be rational.

00:00:37.484 --> 00:00:39.150
So I'm assuming you've
given a go at it.

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:40.360
So let's think about
it a little bit.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.850
I said we will do it through
a proof by contradiction.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:56.360
So let's just assume that a
rational times an irrational

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:57.820
gives us a rational number.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.530
So let's say that this-- to
represent this rational right

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.870
over here, let's represent
it as the ratio of two

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.140
integers, a over b.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.920
And then this irrational
number, I'll just call that x.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:20.220
So we're saying a/b times x can
get us some rational number.

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.600
So let's call that m/n.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.940
Let's call this equaling m/n.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.620
So I'm assuming that a
rational number, which

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.660
can be expressed as the
ratio of two integers,

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.560
times an irrational number can
get me another rational number.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.160
So let's see if we can set
up some form of contradiction

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.330
here.

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.000
Let's solve for the
irrational number.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.570
The best way to
solve is to multiply

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.970
both sides times the reciprocal
of this number right over here.

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:55.640
So this, let's multiply
times b/a, times b/a.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:56.980
And what are we left with?

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:05.509
We get our irrational number
x being equal to m times b.

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:07.050
Or we could just
write that as mb/na.

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.310
So why is this interesting?

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.440
Well, m is an integer,
b is an integer,

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.500
so this whole numerator
is an integer.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.560
And then this whole
denominator is some integer.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.690
So right over here, I have
a ratio of two integers.

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.380
So I've just expressed
what we assumed

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.900
to be an irrational number,
I've just it expressed it

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.820
as the ratio of two integers.

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:45.090
So now we have x
must be rational.

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.330
And that is our
contradiction, because we

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.220
assumed that x is irrational.

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.330
And so therefore,
since this assumption

00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:01.330
leads to this contradiction
right over here,

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.520
this assumption must be false.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:09.280
It must be that a rational times
an irrational is irrational.
