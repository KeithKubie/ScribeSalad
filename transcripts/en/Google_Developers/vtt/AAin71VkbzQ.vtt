a developer student club

00:00:23.003 --> 00:00:24.090

the biggest takeaways

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.890
has been the talk on how
to be a persuasive leader

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.630
and how to build a community.

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:51.970
Also, in terms of
the technical skills,

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:53.500
exploring, and
seeing how I could

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.997

You don't need to be
an expert in coding.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.840
You just need to be there with
your passion and commitment.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.590
