00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:03.330
Let's look into whether bootstrapping
your business is the right

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:04.680
option for you.

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.020
Before we get started,
what is bootstrapping?

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:10.540
Bootstrapping is the act
of financing your business

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.870
using your own personal resources.

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.790
You'll use what you currently have
available to start building and

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:17.510
growing your company.

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.660
There are a few things to be aware of
before considering bootstrapping for

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:21.720
your business.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.390
First let's look at
some of the benefits.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.220
We'll focus on three major benefits
of bootstrapping, freedom,

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.150
profits and commitment.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.890
First, freedom.

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.900
Financing your business yourself
provides you a level of freedom not

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.730
available to you once
investors become involved.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.080
Sometimes you need to be flexible and
make tough choices.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.710
Being on your own, you don't need
to rationalize with investors.

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.410
This will allow you to make your own
decisions about what is best for

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:48.570
the company.

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.520
That said,
you can't build a business in a vacuum.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.000
Successful bootstrappers leverage their
personal and professional networks and

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.080
grow their businesses organically.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.200
Remember to focus on your customer base,
social presence, and

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.560
the momentum you generate through
your business's popularity.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.340
Next, profits.

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:09.240
Without investors, the profits your
business generates come straight to you.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.220
When bootstrapping, you retain equity in
your company and hold shares that would

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.920
normally go to investors if they
had put money into your startup.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.020
And finally, commitment.

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.110
There's nothing that gets you motivated
to figure out your business quite like

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.770
financing it yourself.

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.120
Bootstrapping can give you the extra
incentive needed to work the long hours

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.290
necessary to become successful.

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.350
This experience can definitely help you
become a more resourceful entrepreneur.

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.430
While there are benefits
to bootstrapping,

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.180
it's important to understand some
ways it might not be so great.

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.520
Let's focus on three major downsides of
bootstrapping, expenses, connections,

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.180
and credibility.

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.040
First, expenses.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.510
Launching your startup
can take a lot of money.

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:52.100
Trying to supply this on your own
can become detrimental to your

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.710
personal expenses.

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.180
This could end up affecting
decisions you make.

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.980
If you're low on money,
you might end up making changes that

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.660
aren't in the best interest of your
company to chase early profits.

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.340
This can really stunt
your long term growth.

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.210
Next, connections.

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.800
A lot of investors have been
in business for many years and

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.260
have access to tons of resources.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.450
Working on your own you have less
of these resources available for

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:16.650
your business.

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.330
You also lose any access to the people
within the investors network who could

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.600
advise you as you build your company.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.620
When bootstrapping,

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.410
you're missing out on some of
these opportunities for growth.

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:27.300
And finally,

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.000
being backed by the right investor gives
immediate credibility to your business.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.330
When bootstrapping you might not
be able to get this otherwise.

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:35.740
Without investor support,

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.530
it could make it more difficult to
get investment in later seed rounds.

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.910
So, take some time to
consider the benefits and

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.910
downsides of Bootstrapping your startup.

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.530
When you're ready, decide if you
think this would be a good option for

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:47.190
your business.
