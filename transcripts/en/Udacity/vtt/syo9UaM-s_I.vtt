Let's take a look at another logarithmic equation. Here we have log base 2 of

00:00:06.086 --> 00:00:12.425
2x plus 3 equals 4. Now, how do we go about solving this? Well let's do it in a

00:00:12.425 --> 00:00:17.386
couple of steps. First things first, why don't you just try to get 2x plus 3 by

00:00:17.386 --> 00:00:20.280
itself. What belongs over here?
