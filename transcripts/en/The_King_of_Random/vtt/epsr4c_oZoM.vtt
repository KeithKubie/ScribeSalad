00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:04.970
In a previous project, we took a carbon dioxide
fire extinguisher and shot out a round of

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:10.549
home made dry-ice. In this project, we're
mixing our dry-ice with a few other ingredients,

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:15.189
to make a delicious batch of carbonated ice
cream.

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:36.000
You might remember this CO2 fire extinguisher
from a previous video. I started this project

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.130
by fully discharging it into this pillow case,
just to see just how much dry-ice we could

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:46.440
collect. From a 15lb extinguisher we got over
5 lbs of dry-ice. Now there's a good chance

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.100
you don't have a CO2 fire extinguisher on
hand, and that's ok. This works just as well

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.850
with the blocks of dry-ice you get at the
grocery store. Alright, to make some ice cream

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:01.059
we''ll just need to round up some common ingredients
like these. For this recipe I chose to use

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:06.900
powdered sugar, some half and half, and vanilla
extract. Let's start by pouring 2 cups of

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.250
half &amp; half into a large mixing bowl, followed
by 1 teaspoon of vanilla, and half a cup of

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.820
powered sugar. At this point we can stir it
all together, until the ingredients are mixed

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:22.920
thoroughly. Ok, it's time to put the "ice"
into our ice cream. I'm starting with 1/4

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.619
cup of dry-ice, and we'll need to mix that
around gently to cool down the liquid. The

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:31.590
great thing about dry-ice, is that when it
sublimates, it doesn't water down the mix

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.640
at all. It just vaporizes right out. When
you notice that the fog stops flowing, over

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.420
the edges of your bowl, it's time to add some
more dry-ice, and you're gonna wanna

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.650
crush this up as finely as you can. If you
find any large chunks while stirring, take

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:50.049
a second to pull them out and crush them up
as well. It could be extremely dangerous if

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:56.380
you accidentally swallowed one. This ice is
-78ÂºC, and could leave you with internal

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.579
frostbite, and fill you up with carbon dioxide
gas. I was a little curious to know what that

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:06.640
might feel like, so I popped one in my mouth.
Now, if I continuously move the ice around

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.220
with my tongue, it doesn't sit still long
enough to bite me. Chewing it up into smaller

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:17.150
bits is a little more risky because it releases
a lot more CO2, making it much harder to breathe.

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.970
And the little chunks that stuck in your mouth
actually sting fairly sharply. But overall,

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:27.180
I'd say it's survivable. Ok, when your cream
is cold enough that it has the consistency

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:32.370
of soft-serve ice cream, you're just about
done. Just inspect it one more time for hidden

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.640
clumps of dry-ice, and keep stirring until
the vapor stops completely. At this point,

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.810
you can go ahead, and dish out your tingly
treat. You should find that your ice cream

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:47.360
looks the way you'd expect it should, but
this treat has a twist. It's fizzy. My wife

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.160
gave this one to our little boy for testing,
and once he acclimated to the carbonation,

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.709
he couldn't get enough. Well now you know,
how to make a delicious tasting, carbonated,

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:02.170
ice cream using simple ingredients, and a
little dry-ice. If you like this project,
