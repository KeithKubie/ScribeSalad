00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.180
- [Instructor] We are
told that Theresa consumes

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:05.700
both bagels and toy cars and they tell us

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.030
that the table above shows
Theresa's marginal utility

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.150
from bagels and toy cars.

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.320
And the first question is,
what is her total utility

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.500
from purchasing three toy cars?

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.999
So pause this video and
see if you can answer that.

00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:23.530
All right now lets work
through this together.

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:26.290
So let's just make sure we
understand this table here.

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:30.340
So this says that the first
bagel that Theresa consumes,

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.040
she gets eight units of
marginal utility from that.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.110
Then the second bagel,

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.340
she gets a little bit
less marginal utility.

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.510
Some or her bagel craving
has already been satisfied

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:41.430
by that first one.

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.480
And then the third bagel,
the marginal utility

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.610
goes down a little bit and
then that keeps happening

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.320
for each incremental bagel.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.530
And on the toy side, we
see that that first toy,

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.940
she gets a lotta marginal utility, 10,

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.350
and then the next toy
gets a little bit less,

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.620
and then you see that the
marginal utility for each

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.780
incremental toy gets a
little bit lower and lower.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.240
So now let's answer the first question.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:07.180
What is her total utility from
purchasing three toy cars?

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.400
Well that first toy car,
she gets utility of 10.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.090
Then that second toy car,
she gets a utility of eight.

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.610
And then that third toy
car, her marginal utility

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.280
for that incremental car is six.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.230
So the total utility is going
to be 10 plus eight plus six,

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.570
which is what, 10 plus 14,
this is going to be equal

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.950
to 24 units of marginal utility.

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.840
All right now let's do part two.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.830
Theresa's weekly income is $11,

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.540
the price of a bagel is $2,

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.630
and the price of a toy car is $1.

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.890
What quantity of bagels
and toy cars will maximize

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.765
Theresa's utility if she
spends her entire weekly income

00:01:51.765 --> 00:01:54.970
on bagels and toy cars?

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.810
Explain your answer
using marginal analysis.

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.280
So once again, pause
this video and see if you

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.280
can figure that out.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.880
All right now let's do this together.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.390
I'll scroll down a little
bit so I have some space.

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.110
So the key thing is, is
when once we know the price

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.780
of a bagel and the price
of a toy and we know

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.630
the marginal utility for every
incremental bagel or toy,

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.680
we can figure out our bang for our buck.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.252
We can figure out, what is
going to be the marginal utility

00:02:20.252 --> 00:02:22.980
per dollar from that incremental bagel

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.880
and that incremental toy car?

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.890
And so we can, let's just explain first.

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.890
So Theresa, Theresa will maximize,

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.100
maximize her marginal utility

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.110
per incremental dollar, per dollar,

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.010
or let me put it this way, per dollar,

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:51.210
when making purchases

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:52.890
on the margin,

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.540
making maybe, making purchases

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.790
on the margin.

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.440
So her next incremental purchase,

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.803
her next incremental,

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.150
incremental purchase.

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.730
So we can write over here

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.730
bagel marginal utility per dollar.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:22.670
That'll be one row here.

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.280
And then we could write car

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.940
or toy marginal utility per dollar.

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.413
And then we set up these
rows right over here.

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.366
And then we could think about
it if she for the first one,

00:03:37.366 --> 00:03:41.406
for the second one, for the third one,

00:03:41.406 --> 00:03:44.290
for the fourth one,

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.590
let's see we go up to six, fifth one,

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.490
and then we go to our sixth one.

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:51.130
So let's start with bagels.

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:52.493
Bagels cost $2.

00:03:53.411 --> 00:03:55.450
So that first bagel, if
she gets eight marginal

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.150
utility units, well that's going to be

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.160
four marginal utility units per dollar,

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.060
eight divided by two.

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.940
So that's four units per dollar,
and then that second bagel,

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.260
she gets seven units but it costs $2,

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.400
so it's seven divided
by two units per dollar.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:13.700
So that's going to be 3.5.

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.740
And then six divided by two is three,

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:21.550
five divided by two is 2.5,

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:24.867
four divided by two is two.

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.780
So that fifth bagel, two marginal
utility units per dollar,

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.480
and then that sixth bagel,
three divided by two is 1.5

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:35.120
marginal utility units per dollar.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.860
And now we can think about toys.

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.063
Each toy is $1.

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:41.750
So if she gets 10 marginal utility units

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.200
from that first toy, it only cost her $1,

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.300
so it's 10 utility units per dollar.

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:47.910
So it's 10 there.

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:49.330
It would be eight here.

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:50.930
We're just dividing each of these by one.

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.670
So six here, so this is gonna
be the same number again.

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:56.870
Four, three, and two.

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:58.730
So now that we set this
up, and let me scroll down

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:00.240
a little bit so I have
a little bit more space.

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.040
I have all the data I need.

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.910
We can think about what
would be rational for her

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:05.850
if we're thinking about
how she's gonna spend

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:08.270
that $11 per week.

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.803
Her first purchase, she's like wow,

00:05:10.803 --> 00:05:15.020
from the get go, that if I'm
picking between bagels and toys

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:17.680
that first toy has a much
higher marginal utility

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.420
per dollar than that first bagel.

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:22.350
So she's going to start
here, and then she says,

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:25.430
okay next do I wanna buy a bagel or a toy?

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:28.620
But even that second toy, the
marginal utility per dollar

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.980
is still higher than that first bagel.

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:33.210
So then she'll buy a second toy.

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.610
Then she'll think about it and
so far she's only spent $2,

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:37.910
so we have a lot of money still left.

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:40.130
Then she'll think about
okay, do I wanna spend

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:42.640
that next incremental
amount on a toy or bagel?

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:45.950
Well still, she gets more
marginal utility per dollar

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:47.960
from the toy, so she'll spend that.

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.203
She's spent $3 so far, $1, $2, $3.

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.080
And now, when she thinks
about how to spend

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:57.530
her next few dollars, she
says, well know I'm indifferent

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:59.960
between bagels and toys.

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.380
The marginal utility
per dollar is the same.

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:06.345
So she might maybe spend
the next one on a toy

00:06:06.345 --> 00:06:10.430
and then right after that,
she'll go to bagels finally

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:12.120
and buy a bagel.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.400
Well let's think about how
much she has spent so far.

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:19.210
She's spent $4 on toys and $2 on bagels.

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:23.740
So the order might look
something like this,

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:28.110
and then she goes and
maybe buys her bagel.

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:30.540
And now the marginal utility per dollar

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:33.930
for that incremental
bagel is higher than for

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:36.980
her next toy, and so
then she'll probably buy,

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:39.000
she would buy another bagel right here,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.690
and let's see how much
money she has spent.

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:44.960
Two bagels are $4 plus
she's spent $4 on toys

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.160
because they're $1 each, so it's $8.

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.390
So she still has $3 to spend.

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:51.120
Now, her marginal utility
per dollar is neutral

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:53.347
between bagels and toys,
between the incremental,

00:06:53.347 --> 00:06:55.790
the third bagel and that fifth toy,

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:58.070
so she's indifferent between the two.

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:00.000
So she could probably get both of them.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.530
So she might do something
like that, buy that,

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:05.560
and then she could buy
that or she could do that

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:06.400
in the other order.

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:08.260
And let's see how much money she's spent.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.370
She has spent $5 on toys

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:14.890
and she has spent $6 on bagels,

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:17.730
and so she has spent her $11.

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:20.020
And so to answer the first question,

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:24.640
so she would buy,

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:28.090
she would buy five toys,

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:32.697
five toys, and three bagels,

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:37.110
and three bagels

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:44.520
based on this strategy of maximizing

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:55.410
marginal utility per dollar

00:07:55.410 --> 00:08:00.410
for each incremental,
incremental purchase.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.720
Did I answer all of the questions?

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:08.190
We said the quantity of bagels and toys

00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:10.900
that will maximize her marginal utility

00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:13.380
if she spends her weekly income,
and then we have explained

00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:14.610
using marginal analysis.

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:15.810
Yep, we're looking good.
