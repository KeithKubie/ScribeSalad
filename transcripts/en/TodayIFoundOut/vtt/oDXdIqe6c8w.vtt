00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:04.000
Most Thermostats in Office Buildings Do Nothing

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.549
Thermostat controls in large buildings, such
as many office buildings, don’t usually

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:08.940
do anything.

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.559
These placebo controls for large HVAC systems
do nothing but make you think you are adjusting

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:15.670
the temperature.

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.731
In some cases, the system even includes white
noise generators to make you think that the

00:00:19.731 --> 00:00:24.490
temperature controls are working, when in
fact the heating and cooling systems are controlled

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:25.490
elsewhere.

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:31.500
According to HVAC specialist Richard Dawson,
about 90% of non-secured office thermostats

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.180
are placebo controls.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.730
These dummy thermostat controls have been
used as far back as the 1960s as a response

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.370
to rising heating costs, which resulted in
landlords specifying very specific allowable

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.370
air temperatures for their tenants.

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.129
Allowing office workers to individually adjust
temperatures then became inefficacious.

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:50.960
So why install such controls.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.670
Why not just let everybody know the heating
and cooling system is centrally controlled

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.710
and not individually adjustable?

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.290
This is primarily to cut down on complaints.

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:07.360
As HVACR engineer Joe Olivieri said, “Thermal
Comfort is 90% mental and 10% physical.”

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.870
As an example, HVACR worker Greg Perakes says
when a particularly employee called and complained

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.620
about being too hot,
“Our solution was to install a pneumatic

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:17.620
thermostat.

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.330
We ran the main air line to it inside of an
enclosed I-beam.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.220
Then we just attached a short piece of tubing
to the branch outlet (terminating inside the

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.860
I-beam without being attached to any valves,
etc.).

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.020
[She] could adjust her own temperature whenever
she felt the need.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.590
Thus enabling her to work more and complain
less.

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.210
When she heard the hissing air coming from
inside the I-beam, she felt in control.

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.610
We never heard another word about the situation
from her again.

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.130
Case solved.”

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:47.220
In another example, Vaughn Langless once installed
air and heating systems in an office building,

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.020
only to be inundated with complaints about
the system not working correctly.

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.090
“Even though we were sure our system was
working as it should and maintaining space

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.570
temperatures to within one or two degrees,
we could never completely satisfy the occupants

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:00.670
of the space.

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.810
We mounted a dummy [thermostat] adjacent to
the controlling [thermostat] and gave the

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.019
floor manager the key to the stat—now the
occupants could ‘control’ their space

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:11.940
as they desired with the permission of their
manager.

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.739
The dummy stat did nothing except to give
the occupants the impression that they had

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:22.069
control of the HVAC system and the psychological
effect of having control of their work environment.

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:27.189
Our service calls disappeared, and to my knowledge,
that system is still set up and working as

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:29.650
it has since 1987.”

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:35.180
Modern HVAC systems use temperature sensors
strategically located that are then used by

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.749
a central computer controller that regulates
temperature at each location within a narrow

00:02:39.749 --> 00:02:41.150
allowable range.

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.859
Herein lies the only real way for most office
workers to adjust temperature in their workspace,

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:50.640
by changing the temperature around the thermistors,
wherever they happen to be located in the

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.700
office (often in the air ducts themselves,
though sometimes attached to a wall in a protective

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:56.840
case).

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.470
It should be noted though that manipulating
one thermistor by perhaps placing a lamp with

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.340
an incandescent bulb right next to it to heat
it or placing an ice pack over it won’t

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.340
always work.

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.709
The computer system that controls the temperature
will often use readings from several thermistors

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:13.719
in a section of the building to properly regulate
temperature.

00:03:13.719 --> 00:03:17.969
So if all the other sensors are reading at
70 degrees Fahrenheit and the one you’re

00:03:17.969 --> 00:03:23.329
placing a heat source near is reading 80 degrees,
it will very likely ignore the 80 degree temperature

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:37.260
as a faulty reading.
