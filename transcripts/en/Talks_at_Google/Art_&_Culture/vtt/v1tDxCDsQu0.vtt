[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.746 --> 00:00:10.120
NATHAN BARNES: My
name is Nathan.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.680
I just want to thank
everyone for showing up

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:12.679
and your patience today.

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:15.370
We got this awesome
event going on today.

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:18.100
It was my pleasure and honor to
introduce Jessica Lea Mayfield.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.927
She had time on her tour
to come stop by and talk

00:00:20.927 --> 00:00:23.260
with us for a little bit, so
we can learn about her past

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:24.926
and what kind of
brought her here today.

00:00:24.926 --> 00:00:27.146
And we'll end with a
little set hopefully

00:00:27.146 --> 00:00:28.270
with some beautiful songs--

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:28.390
JESSICA LEA MAYFIELD: Sure.

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.310
NATHAN BARNES: --and
maybe some Q&amp;A as we go.

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.020
But yeah, hello.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.228
How are you doing today?

00:00:33.228 --> 00:00:34.353
JESSICA LEA MAYFIELD: Good.

00:00:34.353 --> 00:00:36.156
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:36.156 --> 00:00:37.620
Yay.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.301
Hi, Nathan.

00:00:39.301 --> 00:00:42.650
So yeah, I am doing well.

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.030
Thanks for having me here.

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.547
Are we under, like,
a giant guitar hole?

00:00:49.547 --> 00:00:50.880
NATHAN BARNES: I think so, yeah.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.089
AUDIENCE: A 10-string guitar.

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:54.088
NATHAN BARNES: We're
hoping that the finale will

00:00:54.088 --> 00:00:55.840
be somehow incorporated
into that guitar,

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:56.530
but we'll get there.

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:56.840
JESSICA LEA MAYFIELD:
Interesting.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:57.853
NATHAN BARNES: We'll get there.

00:00:57.853 --> 00:00:58.600
Yeah.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.110
Excellent.

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.599
Well, you have such
a long kind of career

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:04.849
even though you're kind of
like-- it's a short career.

00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:08.270
Like, you started in a
family band as a child.

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.030
That seems kind of like a
very interesting opportunity

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.297
and a way to kind of adapt
and guide your musical career.

00:01:14.297 --> 00:01:16.380
Would you mind telling us
a little bit about that?

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.340
JESSICA LEA MAYFIELD: Oh, OK.

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.840
Well, yeah.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.490
I've been doing this
for a really long time.

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.090
So I started doing
music with my parents

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.820
when I was eight
years old, and we

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:34.220
lived on an old
tour bus that was

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.870
owned by a bunch of popular
bluegrass and country musicians

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:43.370
at one point-- and
basically just travel around

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:44.590
like hippies.

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:51.510
So I've been touring since
I can remember basically.

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:52.760
NATHAN BARNES: That's amazing.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.175
I could only imagine just kind
of being on the road, one,

00:01:55.175 --> 00:01:56.550
but that's with
the family-- two,

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.758
dynamic-- like, that could
be a very interesting kind

00:01:58.758 --> 00:02:01.017
of relationship to kind
of roll with-- bond with,

00:02:01.017 --> 00:02:03.350
and then also just kind of
takes that musical experience

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.540
as a positive and
keep moving with it.

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:06.770
JESSICA LEA MAYFIELD: I think
it just kind of-- it definitely

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:07.269
made--

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.730
really, it just kind of made
everyone feel like there

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.560
weren't really family roles.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.030
It was just like, OK, we're
all on the same level here

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.010
doing the same thing sort of.

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.130
We're all just traveling
around trying to make money,

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.700
so it's just really interesting
to feel like you were

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.792
on a team with your relatives.

00:02:31.792 --> 00:02:32.750
NATHAN BARNES: Awesome.

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.250
JESSICA LEA MAYFIELD: OK,
so you guys take-- you

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.640
and your brother take that
street corner, and your mom

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:37.850
and I will go over here.

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.720
And let's all play for tips, and
come back, and see what we got.

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.472
And it's interesting--
definitely an interesting way.

00:02:46.472 --> 00:02:48.680
NATHAN BARNES: Was there
like a favorite song or kind

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.513
of a go-to track that
you guys had together,

00:02:50.513 --> 00:02:53.210
or maybe it was like the one
you guys enjoyed doing the most?

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:56.960
JESSICA LEA MAYFIELD: Usually
we pick kind of one song,

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.090
but whatever songs seem to be--

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.560
I'm trying to
remember right now.

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.770
A lot of times it would
be requests of people

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:07.500
would want to hear stuff
like "Amazing Grace."

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:08.377
I'd be like, OK.

00:03:08.377 --> 00:03:09.710
I was just, like, a little girl.

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:10.501
I'm like, whatever.

00:03:13.572 --> 00:03:14.905
NATHAN BARNES: Awesome, awesome.

00:03:14.905 --> 00:03:16.760
Well, you know, obviously,
your musical career

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:17.535
did not end there.

00:03:17.535 --> 00:03:18.160
It kept moving.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.930
And then 2006 about,
if my memory serves,

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:22.640
that's when "White
Lies" came out.

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:23.540
JESSICA LEA MAYFIELD: Mhm, yeah.

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.340
NATHAN BARNES: That was kind
of when I was first introduced

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.798
to you and your music while
you were touring with the Avett

00:03:27.798 --> 00:03:30.090
Brothers, and that was a
beautiful summer of '07.

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.640
I was very happy
to meet you there,

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.130
but as kind of the
legend goes, that

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.830
was the album that kind of got
a particular artist's attention.

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:38.480
And if I have it
right, the gentleman

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.120
from Black Keys, Dan Auerbach--
and then what happened?

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.180
What snowballed from there?

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.670
JESSICA LEA MAYFIELD: Well,
he's from Akron, Ohio,

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:48.560
and I'm from Kent, Ohio.

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:54.730
But when I had recorded that
album at home in a bedroom,

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.640
it ended up getting over to him
somehow, and then from there

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.940
we started just meeting
up a couple of times

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.040
a week and recording,
not really knowing

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.150
what it was going to be.

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.680
And then I ended up making
my first record with him,

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.564
and then I made my second
record with him as well.

00:04:12.564 --> 00:04:13.730
NATHAN BARNES: How was that?

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.274
Because at that time you
could have been a teenager

00:04:16.274 --> 00:04:16.940
one would guess.

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.398
And like, that
could be a very kind

00:04:18.398 --> 00:04:20.930
of unique kind of guiding
experience for a young artist

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.264
to meet someone kind
of that's a big name.

00:04:25.264 --> 00:04:26.930
Like, an adult coming
to you and wanting

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.280
to produce and push your music,
that seems pretty magical.

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.571
JESSICA LEA MAYFIELD: Oh, yeah.

00:04:31.571 --> 00:04:35.130
It was definitely
interesting to kind of--

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:36.810
I had a lot of
friends at the time,

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.650
who knew who they were--
who the Black Keys were.

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.350
And I was just kind of--

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.940
I got hip to it around
the time that I met him,

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.090
and that was around the
time that they were really

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.580
starting to get more popular.

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.600
So I thought, you know, OK,
I'll go hang out with this guy,

00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:00.130
I guess, and work in his
studio, and it'll be whatever.

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:05.130
But it definitely
ended up you know--

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:07.620
still to this day, I
meet a lot of people

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.840
who, the first
album they heard is

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.240
the first one that
I did with Dan, so I

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.830
think that there's still--

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:15.840
people are going
back and finding out

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.320
about me through an album
that came out over 10 years

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:20.504
ago almost.

00:05:20.504 --> 00:05:21.670
NATHAN BARNES: That's crazy.

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:22.740
I kind of did the reverse.

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.281
Like, I had heard
that you were doing

00:05:24.281 --> 00:05:28.417
backup vocals on some kind
of sloppy, jammy blues band.

00:05:28.417 --> 00:05:30.000
I was like, oh, I
should check it out.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.499
And then that's
when I find that you

00:05:31.499 --> 00:05:33.232
did the backup vocals
for "Things Ain't

00:05:33.232 --> 00:05:34.440
Like They Used To Be," right?

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:35.190
JESSICA LEA MAYFIELD: Mhm, yeah.

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:35.850
NATHAN BARNES: And
that was kind of--

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:37.950
I had the reverse kind of
interaction with the Black Keys

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:39.367
like, oh, who is
she playing with?

00:05:39.367 --> 00:05:39.866
Oh, OK.

00:05:39.866 --> 00:05:40.870
Right on, this is sweet.

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:41.690
These guys are good.

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:42.814
JESSICA LEA MAYFIELD: Yeah.

00:05:42.814 --> 00:05:43.950
NATHAN BARNES: Awesome.

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:45.970
Well then, from there we'll--

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:47.690
so the next album
you came out with--

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:49.940
"With Blasphemy, So Heartfelt"--
that was kind of like

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:52.770
your first major produced album
that you and your brother kind

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:54.630
of self-released, produced.

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:56.100
How was that kind
of new experience

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:00.150
from family jam band, to
now stuff on your own,

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:04.960
to kind of like this
more potentially dynamic

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:06.470
for a specific process?

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:09.660
JESSICA LEA
MAYFIELD: It's funny.

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:12.180
"With Blasphemy" was
kind of pieced together

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:16.740
over a period of time where
Dan had this rental space,

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:20.060
and he would get in
different gear and kind

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:24.420
of call me over to guinea
pig and try stuff out.

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:30.030
And then stuff from that became
that album, which is funny,

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:33.450
because then by the time I
did my next album with him,

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:35.900
it was real studio vibes.

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.750
But that first thing was
just kind of like, all right,

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:43.620
one of us has to reach over and
turn this machine on and then

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:44.130
get--

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:48.780
whoever's closer to it and who
isn't starting the song first.

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:52.220
It was very still kind of--

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:53.940
I feel like "With
Blasphemy" still

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:59.010
has those bedroomy
vibes of just like, hey,

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:01.380
we're using nicer
stuff, but it's just

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:05.720
like a very small
group of people.

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:07.655
But I can't even
really say a group.

00:07:07.655 --> 00:07:09.030
NATHAN BARNES:
Was there any kind

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:10.357
of intimidation level with it?

00:07:10.357 --> 00:07:12.690
Like, obviously, you've been
around music and performers

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:13.954
as a young kid.

00:07:13.954 --> 00:07:15.870
So was is just like
another day at the office,

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:20.372
or was there kind of like on
moment involved in it at all?

00:07:20.372 --> 00:07:22.080
JESSICA LEA MAYFIELD:
I mean, not really.

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:24.710
I don't get-- it's interesting.

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:28.594
I don't really get too
nervous around people.

00:07:28.594 --> 00:07:29.760
NATHAN BARNES: Good for you.

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:31.442
It's a great power.

00:07:31.442 --> 00:07:33.400
JESSICA LEA MAYFIELD:
--more like single people

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:36.750
not like a large
group of people maybe.

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:39.070
I don't know.

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:39.990
That sounds bad.

00:07:42.612 --> 00:07:43.945
NATHAN BARNES: Awesome, awesome.

00:07:43.945 --> 00:07:46.010
Well, I kind of brought
the Avett Brothers earlier

00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:47.520
and like definitely
seeing you guys tour.

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:48.690
Like, any time you
guys do a harmony,

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:50.230
it's the most
beautiful thing ever.

00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:50.440
JESSICA LEA MAYFIELD: Thank you.

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:52.370
NATHAN BARNES: Love
Scottie so much.

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:54.960
And so, you guys have this
awesome Elliot Smith tribute

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:55.500
album.

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:57.390
That's just beautiful
and gorgeous,

00:07:57.390 --> 00:08:00.671
and it's obvious that Elliott
Smith was a potential influence

00:08:00.671 --> 00:08:01.170
around you.

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:04.320
But I'm kind of curious what
led you to this specific project

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:05.890
and also with Scott Avett.

00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:07.420
JESSICA LEA MAYFIELD: That
was with Seth actually.

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:08.020
NATHAN BARNES: Oh, sorry.

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:08.560
JESSICA LEA
MAYFIELD: No worries.

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:09.360
NATHAN BARNES: Pardon me.

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:09.870
JESSICA LEA MAYFIELD: That's OK.

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:12.119
There were actually people
that would come to the show

00:08:12.119 --> 00:08:16.745
and still think that it was
Scott, which I don't get.

00:08:16.745 --> 00:08:18.977
I think people confuse
them just a little bit.

00:08:18.977 --> 00:08:20.310
NATHAN BARNES: Pardon my nerves.

00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:21.820
JESSICA LEA MAYFIELD:
No, it's OK.

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:23.844
Whatever.

00:08:23.844 --> 00:08:25.080
I'm just kidding.

00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:35.570
Seth and I realized that we were
both big Elliott Smith fans,

00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:38.640
and that was just
something we would end up

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:43.230
talking about almost every time
we saw each other until one

00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:44.800
point we were on tour together.

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:47.550
And we both walked
into the screen room,

00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:48.660
and it had a piano.

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:51.810
And he started playing
an Elliott Smith song,

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:53.340
and I started singing it.

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:55.740
And from there,
we were like, OK,

00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:58.560
we should do
something like this.

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:01.440
And we just kept
sending each other voice

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:04.230
memos of Elliot
Smith songs until we

00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:07.397
had more than enough ideas.

00:09:07.397 --> 00:09:08.730
NATHAN BARNES: That's very cool.

00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:10.529
And it's a lovely album.

00:09:10.529 --> 00:09:12.570
And I was always trying
to put my finger on a way

00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:13.830
to kind of describe
it, and I kind of

00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:15.960
stumbled upon a review
that of set it so well

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:19.829
to where it wasn't like you guys
trying to reinvent or change

00:09:19.829 --> 00:09:21.120
the songs and make it your own.

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:24.284
It was more just kind of like an
honest homage to Elliott Smith,

00:09:24.284 --> 00:09:26.700
and that just kind of put it
all into a wonderful nutshell

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:28.530
for me when I was like
thinking of that album--

00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:29.540
how you guys put it together.

00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:31.123
JESSICA LEA MAYFIELD:
Well, thank you.

00:09:31.123 --> 00:09:34.200
It was kind of
stressful, especially

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:37.050
as huge Elliott
Smith fans, I think

00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:40.530
we understood that
you're attempting

00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:43.490
to mess with something
that's pretty delicate.

00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:47.820
And I had to put myself in the
shoes of if someone else did

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:51.220
that, would I be like,
what are you doing?

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:52.970
You can't sing
Elliot Smith songs.

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:55.710
Like, no, only he can do that.

00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:57.060
You know, he's the best at that.

00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:59.640
So there's definitely
that line to draw

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:03.330
of wanting to do a
good enough job to do

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:06.990
it justice without
making it too different

00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:09.480
or ruining it somehow.

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:11.280
I think we just didn't
want to ruin it.

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:12.570
NATHAN BARNES: Well,
whatever level you found,

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:14.180
it was wonderful
and thank you for.

00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:14.430
JESSICA LEA MAYFIELD:
Oh, thank you.

00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:17.060
NATHAN BARNES: The version of
"Fond Farewell for a Friend"

00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:18.100
was just--

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:18.930
it gets me.

00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:20.107
It's very beautiful.

00:10:20.107 --> 00:10:21.440
JESSICA LEA MAYFIELD: Thank you.

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:22.495
NATHAN BARNES: Yeah.

00:10:22.495 --> 00:10:24.120
What else do I have
to harass you with?

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:25.020
JESSICA LEA MAYFIELD:
Any more compliments?

00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:25.790
No, I'm just kidding.

00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:26.080
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:27.345
NATHAN BARNES: Oh, that's
what the last page is.

00:10:27.345 --> 00:10:27.600
JESSICA LEA MAYFIELD:
I like this.

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:28.650
NATHAN BARNES: I just
have a list of things

00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:30.180
that I like about you,
so we'll get there.

00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:30.633
JESSICA LEA MAYFIELD: Ooh.

00:10:30.633 --> 00:10:31.757
NATHAN BARNES: Don't worry.

00:10:31.757 --> 00:10:32.900
Yeah, yeah.

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:36.979
Well, we have your newest
album, "Sorry is Gone."

00:10:36.979 --> 00:10:38.520
It's a very interesting
album for me.

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:39.830
It felt like there
was a lot more.

00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:41.880
Like, it just seems there
is so much happening though,

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:42.780
but it flows really well.

00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:43.620
JESSICA LEA MAYFIELD:
Did you not like it?

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:43.910
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:44.960
NATHAN BARNES: No, I do like it.

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:46.418
But this is why
I'm bringing it up.

00:10:49.315 --> 00:10:51.980
There's just this kind
of rawness within it.

00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:53.370
Like, it's not it's scattered.

00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:56.490
It flows for me, but it does
have a different depth for me.

00:10:56.490 --> 00:10:58.960
And then when I saw the
title of "Sorry is Gone,"

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:02.182
I was wondering if that was kind
of a reflection of the steps

00:11:02.182 --> 00:11:04.140
that you were trying to
kind of create or maybe

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:05.490
project with it.

00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:08.070
Because it's such
a kind of simple--

00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:10.720
it's saying so little
with just "Sorry is Gone,"

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:13.920
but it seems like there was kind
of a lot behind it potentially.

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:17.310
JESSICA LEA MAYFIELD: Well,
I mean, I think this album,

00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:20.300
it came together
without me really

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:25.690
realizing if any theme
there was going to be.

00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:27.960
And I realized that
a lot of the songs

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:33.180
were all working together
for the theme of being

00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:36.630
not afraid to be
yourself, I guess,

00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:39.000
which obviously sounds
cheesy and funny.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.240
But it's I don't
know-- you shouldn't be

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:44.317
embarrassed to talk about them.

00:11:44.317 --> 00:11:45.900
NATHAN BARNES: Yeah,
that's beautiful.

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:47.820
And I think that's kind
of this variation of sound

00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:49.390
that kind of comes into
producing this album.

00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:50.973
It kind of reflects
what you were just

00:11:50.973 --> 00:11:53.686
saying of that
genuine self, which

00:11:53.686 --> 00:11:54.810
I found was really awesome.

00:11:54.810 --> 00:11:54.850
JESSICA LEA MAYFIELD: Thank you.

00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:57.058
NATHAN BARNES: And I was
just curious about the title

00:11:57.058 --> 00:11:59.340
and like maybe how
it played with it.

00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:00.490
Sweet.

00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:00.990
All right.

00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:03.460
Well, I have some more kind
of just like silly questions

00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:03.760
for you.

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:05.176
If we may, we can
lighten the mood

00:12:05.176 --> 00:12:07.360
a little bit before we
hear some of your music.

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:08.800
JESSICA LEA MAYFIELD: Ask away.

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:10.450
NATHAN BARNES: So like, I
feel like there is always

00:12:10.450 --> 00:12:12.074
someone at shows who
just kind of wants

00:12:12.074 --> 00:12:16.469
to scream song requests at you,
so is there any in particular

00:12:16.469 --> 00:12:18.760
that have stood out over the
years-- that kind of maybe

00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:20.884
cracked a smile or maybe
even were, like, indulged?

00:12:24.357 --> 00:12:25.690
JESSICA LEA MAYFIELD: Let's see.

00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:28.750
I don't think I've ever had
anyone request something--

00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:30.850
unless it's my song,
and they request it,

00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:31.810
then I might play it.

00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:35.380
But it's one thing, people
will go back with my songs,

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:37.980
and they'll go
really, really far to,

00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:39.694
like, the very,
very first album.

00:12:39.694 --> 00:12:40.860
NATHAN BARNES: "White Lies"?

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:42.318
JESSICA LEA MAYFIELD:
Yeah, they'll

00:12:42.318 --> 00:12:45.610
want to hear something that's
more than 10 years old that I

00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:47.580
wrote when I was, like, 15.

00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:50.215
And I'm thinking, I
don't remember that.

00:12:50.215 --> 00:12:52.100
And this is like--

00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:54.660
there was this one show
where I had played and then

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:56.800
came back up for the
encore, and we were all

00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:59.800
getting ready to play
"Our Hearts are Wrong."

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:03.340
This drunk woman comes up,
and she goes, no, stop.

00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:06.250
And she's like, you're
going to play this song.

00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:09.590
And it was like some really
slow, weird, sad song

00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:11.320
off of "White Lies."

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:14.710
And I'm like, no, this is
the last song of the night.

00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:16.330
It has to be something fun.

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:19.610
And she got really
mad and stormed out.

00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:21.682
So that's probably a
more interesting thing.

00:13:21.682 --> 00:13:23.140
I think people get
really emotional

00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:24.639
if I don't do what
they ask me to.

00:13:24.639 --> 00:13:26.722
NATHAN BARNES: Well, you're
there for them, right?

00:13:26.722 --> 00:13:27.960
JESSICA LEA MAYFIELD: Yeah.

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:28.793
I'm like, I'm sorry.

00:13:28.793 --> 00:13:33.010
Like, I have a plan,
like a list of songs

00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:37.597
to do that the band learned.

00:13:37.597 --> 00:13:39.430
NATHAN BARNES: And I
promise this one wasn't

00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:41.500
like a temperamental question.

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:43.180
I didn't bring it
up on the spot.

00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:44.612
But I was wondering if--

00:13:44.612 --> 00:13:46.570
over the years of touring,
I'm sure you kind of

00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:47.944
come across a lot
of interesting,

00:13:47.944 --> 00:13:51.010
to silly, to, like, comical
interactions or obstacles.

00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:53.350
And I'm wondering if
you have maybe one that

00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:55.990
comes to mind that brings
the biggest smiles or laughs

00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:58.367
as you look back?

00:13:58.367 --> 00:14:00.200
JESSICA LEA MAYFIELD:
Obstacles that bring--

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:04.460
NATHAN BARNES: Silly things
like traveling every day,

00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:05.750
on the road, cars--

00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:08.250
there could be always
trouble out there, you know.

00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:10.250
JESSICA LEA MAYFIELD: Oh,
there's always trouble

00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:14.240
out there like booking a
hotel in the wrong city,

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:20.150
and then driving to the right
city, and realizing it later.

00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:27.755
I'm trying to think of what kind
of goofy snafus that happen.

00:14:27.755 --> 00:14:28.970
I don't know.

00:14:28.970 --> 00:14:31.670
It's actually kind
of boring honestly.

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:37.790
It's just kind of like
sitting in a hotel eating.

00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:39.800
NATHAN BARNES: That sounds nice.

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:43.580
JESSICA LEA MAYFIELD:
It's like eating in bed--

00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:45.380
playing a rock
show, eating in bed.

00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:49.800
Maybe if I'm lucky I can
lay in bed before the show

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:52.305
if I have time.

00:14:52.305 --> 00:14:53.930
This is where it gets
really exciting--

00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:59.405
basically just like eating,
and sleeping, and music--

00:14:59.405 --> 00:15:00.440
NATHAN BARNES: The normal
things-- people things.

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:01.660
JESSICA LEA MAYFIELD:
--and driving.

00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:02.618
NATHAN BARNES: Awesome.

00:15:02.618 --> 00:15:04.002
JESSICA LEA MAYFIELD: Yeah.

00:15:04.002 --> 00:15:06.395
NATHAN BARNES: Well, kind
of like on the same level--

00:15:06.395 --> 00:15:09.200
is there, like, a group or
an artist that you've enjoyed

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:11.075
and that was kind of
touring or has been kind

00:15:11.075 --> 00:15:12.947
of a special or fun experience?

00:15:12.947 --> 00:15:15.530
JESSICA LEA MAYFIELD: Well, it's
funny you mentioned the Avett

00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:16.250
Brothers.

00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:18.470
I kind of look back on that--

00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:21.830
that was some of the
first touring that I did.

00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:23.900
It was with them and
with the Black Keys,

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:27.194
and I was really young.

00:15:27.194 --> 00:15:28.610
And that was the
first time I ever

00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:32.430
did any West Coast touring
was with the Avett Brothers,

00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:36.670
so there was definitely
a lot of first-time tour

00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:40.577
things with them that
I always think about.

00:15:40.577 --> 00:15:42.160
That's fun, because
I'll go somewhere,

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:43.284
and I'll be like, oh, yeah.

00:15:43.284 --> 00:15:46.430
I've been here a
million times now,

00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:50.110
but I remember the
first time I came here.

00:15:50.110 --> 00:15:51.894
NATHAN BARNES: Sweet, very cool.

00:15:51.894 --> 00:15:54.310
And then how about like, what
do you listen to these days?

00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:55.310
And if there is like--

00:15:55.310 --> 00:15:57.820
if you were trying
to sit in a bed

00:15:57.820 --> 00:16:01.209
and eat some food in a hotel
room, what do you put on?

00:16:01.209 --> 00:16:02.500
JESSICA LEA MAYFIELD: OK, well.

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:03.584
Let's see.

00:16:03.584 --> 00:16:04.880
What do I put on?

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:07.540
I don't really watch much TV.

00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:10.960
NATHAN BARNES: Or music-wise,
who do you listen to?

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:13.660
JESSICA LEA MAYFIELD:
Music-wise, it's funny.

00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:15.280
I don't really
branch out very much.

00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:19.510
I keep to, like, the
same group of artists,

00:16:19.510 --> 00:16:25.350
so it's always Elliott Smith,
Metallica, Soundgarden,

00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:27.332
just all '90s--

00:16:27.332 --> 00:16:28.540
NATHAN BARNES: '90s classics?

00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:32.070
JESSICA LEA MAYFIELD:
--heavy, a lot of heavy music.

00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:34.480
I've been trying to listen
to some books on tape,

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:36.060
but it's hard to stay awake.

00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:39.200
So it's not a good thing
to do while driving,

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:41.064
but I still try
to do it anyways.

00:16:41.064 --> 00:16:42.730
And then if you fall
asleep while you're

00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:47.330
listening to it in bed, then
you don't retain any of it--

00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:49.980
so still trying to figure
out books on tape--

00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:50.560
NATHAN BARNES: It'll
be there for you.

00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:52.143
They'll be waiting
for you, I promise.

00:16:52.143 --> 00:16:54.662
JESSICA LEA MAYFIELD:
--and how that works.

00:16:54.662 --> 00:16:55.620
NATHAN BARNES: Awesome.

00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:57.536
Well, you know, I just
wanted to kind of spend

00:16:57.536 --> 00:17:00.210
some time to share your past
and hear where you're coming.

00:17:00.210 --> 00:17:01.810
And like, while
you're here today,

00:17:01.810 --> 00:17:03.820
maybe now would be a good
time to treat everyone

00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:06.369
with their patience with a few
tracks and then maybe a little

00:17:06.369 --> 00:17:08.150
Q&amp;A at the end, if
that's all right by you.

00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:08.829
JESSICA LEA MAYFIELD: Sure.

00:17:08.829 --> 00:17:09.279
NATHAN BARNES: Beautiful.

00:17:09.279 --> 00:17:11.359
Well, I'm going to
recede from the stage.

00:17:11.359 --> 00:17:11.954
JESSICA LEA MAYFIELD: Can
I have a sip of that water?

00:17:11.954 --> 00:17:12.996
You're going to leave me?

00:17:12.996 --> 00:17:14.704
NATHAN BARNES: I'll
sit here if you like.

00:17:14.704 --> 00:17:15.910
Yeah, I can be the water.

00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:16.780
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:19.329

here and be the water boy.

welcome to sing along.

I might on accident.

There is a show tonight.

NATHAN BARNES: Oh, of course.

00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:30.400
Pardon, I should
know about that.

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:31.870
JESSICA LEA MAYFIELD: Will you
be singing at the show tonight?

00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:33.040
NATHAN BARNES: I will be
singing at the show tonight.

00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:34.780
Tonight, at the
Independent, we'll

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:38.190
get to see a full set from the
lovely Jessica Lea Mayfield.

00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:39.860
Tickets are still
probably available,

00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:42.327

you should come and join us.

Do you have any
requests, Nathan?

NATHAN BARNES: Oh, my goodness.

00:24:08.455 --> 00:24:09.570
JESSICA LEA MAYFIELD: Oh, gosh.

00:24:09.570 --> 00:24:11.170
NATHAN BARNES: Well,
if I go, I would

00:24:11.170 --> 00:24:13.195
hate to say something too old.

00:24:13.195 --> 00:24:15.902
But I've had "For Today"
stuck in my head for a minute.

00:24:15.902 --> 00:24:17.860
JESSICA LEA MAYFIELD: Do
you want to hear that?

00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:20.230
NATHAN BARNES: If you
would, I would not--

00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:20.910
yeah?

00:24:20.910 --> 00:24:23.090
JESSICA LEA MAYFIELD: I
would do that for you.

00:24:23.090 --> 00:24:24.340
NATHAN BARNES: Goodness.

00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:24.725
JESSICA LEA MAYFIELD: All right.

00:24:24.725 --> 00:24:25.700
NATHAN BARNES: Yes, please.

far, but for Nathan--

beginning-- to the beginning.

for keeping that in my head

for the next week or two.

00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:57.565
So what do you think you--
a little break for some Q&amp;A?

00:28:57.565 --> 00:28:59.560
JESSICA LEA MAYFIELD: Yeah,
you want to-- do you want to--

00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:00.601
you want me to play more?

00:29:00.601 --> 00:29:02.457
Do you have more questions?

00:29:02.457 --> 00:29:04.540
NATHAN BARNES: I kind of
ran through my questions.

00:29:04.540 --> 00:29:07.290
Maybe we can do a little
Q&amp;A then some more songs?

00:29:07.290 --> 00:29:08.010

Yeah, totally.

while you ask me a question?

Yeah, let's do that.

00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:14.430
JESSICA LEA MAYFIELD:
OK, so just start asking.

00:29:14.430 --> 00:29:15.596
I'll come up with something.

00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:28.060
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:29.192
Hello, Jessica.

00:29:29.192 --> 00:29:30.650
Thank you for coming.

00:29:30.650 --> 00:29:32.600
JESSICA LEA MAYFIELD:
Wow, you sound great.

00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:33.520
Thank you.

00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:39.230
AUDIENCE: I wanted to
ask what do you find most

00:29:39.230 --> 00:29:41.890
gratifying about your career?

00:29:41.890 --> 00:29:44.830
Is it making music
and touring, or is it

00:29:44.830 --> 00:29:48.140
putting an album out or
meeting super fans like Nathan?

00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:54.770
JESSICA LEA MAYFIELD:
Those are great points.

00:29:54.770 --> 00:29:58.260
I think there's
something too about--

00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:00.480
it could be-- it's
interesting to--

00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:04.380
I really like the personal
process of writing songs,

00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:07.680
and then I feel like the
process of sharing them almost

00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:11.070
goes against what it is,
because it's definitely a really

00:30:11.070 --> 00:30:14.160
private collection of feelings.

00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:17.730
And then I go out and
share them with everyone,

00:30:17.730 --> 00:30:20.640
so there is kind of those
two different aspects, which

00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:27.295
I like to have the contrast.

00:30:27.295 --> 00:30:28.660
AUDIENCE: Well, thank you.

00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:30.040
JESSICA LEA MAYFIELD: Yeah.

00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:33.060
AUDIENCE: Who do you
share them with first?

00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:36.640
JESSICA LEA MAYFIELD: Ooh,
I'm kind of weird like that.

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:38.520
So if I'm going to work
on it with someone,

00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:39.769
then I would play it for them.

00:30:39.769 --> 00:30:41.640
Otherwise, if I'm just
working on something,

00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:45.390
I might just play it at a
show and see what happens.

00:30:45.390 --> 00:30:49.440
And I try it once, and if
I don't like it, then I'm--

00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:52.140
just never play it again.

00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:55.010
Otherwise, if I like
something about it,

00:30:55.010 --> 00:30:59.768
then it might make its way
into something eventually.

00:30:59.768 --> 00:31:00.967
AUDIENCE: Cool, thank you.

00:31:00.967 --> 00:31:02.300
JESSICA LEA MAYFIELD: Yeah, rad.

00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:03.090
Thank you.

JESSICA LEA MAYFIELD: Next.

00:31:08.775 --> 00:31:11.220
No, I'm just kidding.

00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:17.070
AUDIENCE: On a related subject,
we have a few groups here

00:31:17.070 --> 00:31:20.630
for songwriters,
producers, and musicians.

00:31:20.630 --> 00:31:23.850
And a topic that
frequently comes up

00:31:23.850 --> 00:31:27.585
is the difficulties of
the songwriting process

00:31:27.585 --> 00:31:30.795
is finishing what you start.

00:31:30.795 --> 00:31:34.770
I'm wondering what you can share
with us about your own process

00:31:34.770 --> 00:31:40.470
and, you know, the difficulties
in writing a song album.

00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:44.550
JESSICA LEA MAYFIELD: I
think that it's easier--

00:31:44.550 --> 00:31:46.710
it's easy to realize
that something might not

00:31:46.710 --> 00:31:49.920
be that great of an idea
if you're having a really

00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:51.030
hard time finishing it.

00:31:51.030 --> 00:31:53.100
So I think the
thing about that is

00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:56.790
to make sure you
are excited enough

00:31:56.790 --> 00:31:59.130
by the idea to follow
through, and that's

00:31:59.130 --> 00:32:00.840
something I've learned.

00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:04.080
If that's not how you feel, then
make yourself feel that way.

00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:06.690
Because if I'm not wanting
to follow through on an idea,

00:32:06.690 --> 00:32:11.010
I have to ask myself why
am I procrastinating on it.

00:32:11.010 --> 00:32:13.140
And it's just like,
oh, because I'm not

00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:15.720
that passionate about it.

00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:17.850
So I think, for me,
that's the main thing--

00:32:17.850 --> 00:32:21.810
is to just keep finding ways to
stay excited about what you're

00:32:21.810 --> 00:32:22.810
working on.

00:32:22.810 --> 00:32:24.060

All right.

00:32:46.430 --> 00:32:47.930
AUDIENCE: So on
that same topic, I'm

00:32:47.930 --> 00:32:50.067
wondering do you write
your lyrics first then

00:32:50.067 --> 00:32:51.990
the music or vise versa?

00:32:51.990 --> 00:32:54.950
JESSICA LEA MAYFIELD:
Well, that changes.

00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:56.330
I go through phases.

00:32:56.330 --> 00:32:58.910
It's usually lyrics first.

00:32:58.910 --> 00:33:02.960
Sometimes I'll come up with
a melody that I really like,

00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:05.180
and I'll hate the
lyrics, and then

00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:09.322
I'll put lyrics that I
wrote previously to that.

00:33:09.322 --> 00:33:11.030
But it's definitely
two different things.

00:33:11.030 --> 00:33:13.300
I'll write something,
and either I'll

00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:16.530
really like the
lyrics or the melody

00:33:16.530 --> 00:33:18.690
and then work from there.

00:33:18.690 --> 00:33:20.690
I'll decide what is it
about it that I liked?

00:33:20.690 --> 00:33:23.660
Was it the way I was--
was it the words,

00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:26.199
or was it the way that
I was saying the words?

00:33:26.199 --> 00:33:27.782
AUDIENCE: Do you
have someone that you

00:33:27.782 --> 00:33:31.669
collaborate with [INAUDIBLE]?

00:33:31.669 --> 00:33:32.710
JESSICA LEA MAYFIELD: No.

00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:36.620
I mean, I don't collaborate
that often as far as--

00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:39.830
I'm kind of bad about
that with songwriting.

00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:42.640
And if I do I just have to--

00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:44.780
a lot of the times just
give a song to someone else

00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:46.520
and leave them alone with it.

00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:51.640
I definitely can't watch while
someone else tears it apart.

00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:54.310
You know, it's hard
to be open minded.

00:33:54.310 --> 00:33:56.130
Once you hear
someone else's ideas,

00:33:56.130 --> 00:33:58.390
it's hard to immediately
not just be like, I hate it.

00:33:58.390 --> 00:33:59.560
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:01.120
It's not my idea.

00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:06.700
You have to actually try to see
what could be good about it,

00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:10.284
you know, just because
it's someone else's idea.

00:34:10.284 --> 00:34:11.040
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:12.831
JESSICA LEA MAYFIELD:
Yeah, you're welcome.

00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:18.945
AUDIENCE: Thanks again for
performing this afternoon.

00:34:18.945 --> 00:34:20.278
JESSICA LEA MAYFIELD: Thank you.

00:34:20.278 --> 00:34:22.760
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
you've had like a whole life

00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:24.805
and career in the
music industry,

00:34:24.805 --> 00:34:27.805
and you started out of
doing it on corners at shows

00:34:27.805 --> 00:34:29.759
and meeting back
with the family.

00:34:29.759 --> 00:34:32.300
You've seen a lot of the music
industry change over the years

00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:33.530
as well.

00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:35.060
And I'm wondering
if you could share

00:34:35.060 --> 00:34:38.899
if you have any sort of
gripes with where the music

00:34:38.899 --> 00:34:42.071
industry is today, where
you might see improvements

00:34:42.071 --> 00:34:43.570
in the future, or
kind of what you'd

00:34:43.570 --> 00:34:48.394
like to see in the future
for the music industry?

00:34:48.394 --> 00:34:49.810
JESSICA LEA MAYFIELD:
Interesting.

00:34:49.810 --> 00:34:53.020
Yeah, it's weird.

00:34:53.020 --> 00:34:58.870
It's kind of like I don't really
have, like, an idea to fix it,

00:34:58.870 --> 00:35:01.780
but you can see
what's happening.

00:35:01.780 --> 00:35:04.550
And it's been happening
for most of my life for me.

00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:13.830
I can look back to music being
free when I was 10, 11, 12,

00:35:13.830 --> 00:35:18.850
and remembering, like,
Napster and all this stuff,

00:35:18.850 --> 00:35:21.450
and seeing that even as--

00:35:21.450 --> 00:35:24.970
kind of watching that happen
and watching people that

00:35:24.970 --> 00:35:27.400
used to make money
doing something--

00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:30.590
have people not really want
to invest in it anymore.

00:35:30.590 --> 00:35:34.330
And I guess that's
something that I've

00:35:34.330 --> 00:35:39.789
kind of seen the way things have
changed, and it's just not--

00:35:39.789 --> 00:35:40.330
I don't know.

00:35:40.330 --> 00:35:43.710
But I didn't really see the way
things were at the same time

00:35:43.710 --> 00:35:47.430
too, so it's an interesting--

00:35:47.430 --> 00:35:50.710
I'm really curious
to see where it goes,

00:35:50.710 --> 00:35:53.430
but I have no idea of how
I could even imagine that.

00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:56.055
Because who knows what's
going to keep changing?

00:35:58.885 --> 00:35:59.880
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:00.480
JESSICA LEA MAYFIELD: Yeah, no.

00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:01.310
You're welcome.

00:36:01.310 --> 00:36:01.880
Thank you.

00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:09.130
AUDIENCE: I'm looking for
advice on how not to lose songs.

00:36:09.130 --> 00:36:11.329
So specifically,
imagine you're in love.

00:36:11.329 --> 00:36:12.370
JESSICA LEA MAYFIELD: OK.

00:36:12.370 --> 00:36:15.340
AUDIENCE: And you write a love
song, and it's a great song,

00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:17.030
and then you break up.

00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:18.741
What do you do with
that love song that

00:36:18.741 --> 00:36:19.866
reminds you of that person?

00:36:19.866 --> 00:36:21.225
Do you lose it, or
do you have a way

00:36:21.225 --> 00:36:22.433
of owning it, and taking
it back, and making

00:36:22.433 --> 00:36:23.040
it yours again?

00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:24.331
JESSICA LEA MAYFIELD: Oh, yeah.

00:36:24.331 --> 00:36:27.940
You just keep singing
it, and you definitely

00:36:27.940 --> 00:36:29.639
apply it to something else.

00:36:29.639 --> 00:36:30.180
I don't know.

00:36:33.620 --> 00:36:36.860
I mean, give it some
time if you have to.

00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:40.120
But I mean, especially if you
really like the song, then just

00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:41.380
be like, hey, you know what?

00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:48.340
The one cool thing I got out
of this was this rad song.

00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:54.160
Look at it that way instead
of thinking about her

00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:56.270
or whatever--

00:36:56.270 --> 00:36:58.256
whoever it is.

00:36:58.256 --> 00:37:00.205
AUDIENCE: Do you have
any songs like that?

00:37:00.205 --> 00:37:01.830
JESSICA LEA MAYFIELD:
Yeah, definitely.

00:37:01.830 --> 00:37:07.720
I mean, I am kind of a
relationship writer too,

00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:09.350
so it's--

00:37:09.350 --> 00:37:12.370
I definitely write about every
relationship that I've been in,

00:37:12.370 --> 00:37:17.290
and then eventually it goes
back to when I was a teenager.

00:37:17.290 --> 00:37:19.750
So there's a lot
of teenage breakups

00:37:19.750 --> 00:37:22.086
that I still end
up singing about,

00:37:22.086 --> 00:37:23.710
and I think that's
ridiculous that this

00:37:23.710 --> 00:37:28.150
is part of my life and career.

00:37:28.150 --> 00:37:32.080
But it's like,
hey, at least I got

00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:35.570
the part of my life and career
out of this relationship.

00:37:35.570 --> 00:37:36.330
So cool.

I could do more music.

time for some music?
