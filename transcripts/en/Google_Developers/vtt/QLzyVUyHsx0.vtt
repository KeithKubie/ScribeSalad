DAN GALPIN: Hello.

00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:04.050
I'm Dan Galpin for
"The Developer Show."

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:06.390
This is your weekly update
on the coolest developer

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:07.860
news from Google.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.230
We recently introduced
support for digital goods

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.240
and subscriptions, as
well as Google sign-in

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.294
for the Assistant.

00:00:13.294 --> 00:00:15.960
This will make it easier for you
to create a seamless purchasing

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.880
path across devices
and to better

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.180
personalize the experience for
your users on the Assistant.

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.040
For more details
and screenshots,

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.380
take a look at the post linked
in the description below.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.230
The Google Cloud
Platform team recently

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.480
launched a dedicated
Kotlin portal

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.940
to help you more easily
find resources related

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.800
to Kotlin on Google Cloud.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.800
Additionally, Google has
joined forces with JetBrains

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.290
and established the
Kotlin Foundation.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.150
The foundation will
ensure that Kotlin

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.560
continues to advance rapidly,
remain free, and stay open.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.230
To learn more about this
and other Kotlin news,

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.561
head on over to the post.

00:00:51.561 --> 00:00:54.660
Asset Inventory is
now available in beta.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.420
With it, you can get an org
wide snapshot of your inventory

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.210
for a wide variety of Google
Cloud Platform resources

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.980
and policies with
a single API call.

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.709
This can then be used
by automation tools

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:06.750
for monitoring, or
policy enforcement,

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.180
or be archived for
compliance auditing.

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.330
Example code is on the post.

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.520
We recently extended
the Gmail API

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.920
by bringing you new ways
to manage the delegate

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.870
settings of users in G Suite.

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.270
With Gmail delegation,
you can grant access

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.300
to a person's mailbox to another
person in their organization,

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.370
such as giving an
administrative assistant access

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.050
to an executive's mailbox.

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.910
Links to get started
are on the post.

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:32.940
The Go Project is
conducting research

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.550
to better understand which
companies are using Go

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.530
and how they are
using the language.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.270
This questionnaire
will provide data

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.250
on how the Go language
and ecosystem can

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.830
improve to better serve
the needs of your company.

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.440
Please head on over to
the post before October 30

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.050
to take the seven-minute
questionnaire.

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.240
Please remember to like,
subscribe, and share.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.970

we'll see you next week.

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:57.210

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:59.850

to need a different shirt.
