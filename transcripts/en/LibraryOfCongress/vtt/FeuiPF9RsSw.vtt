&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.600
&gt;&gt; Valda Morris: Welcome.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.000
I'm Valda Morris the curator

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.710
of the International
Storytelling Center here

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.940
at the American Folklife Center
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:34.600
And I would like to welcome
each and every one of you all

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.190
to our latest presentation

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.450
of our ongoing Benjamin
Botkin Lecture Series.

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.960
The Benjamin Series allows
us to highlight the work

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.070
of leading scholars in the
disciplines of folklore,

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.860
ethnomusicology, oral
history and culture, heritage,

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.170 position:56%
while enhancing the collections here
at the American Folklife Center.

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.250
For the center and the library,

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.160
the Botkin lectures
form an important facet

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.710
of our acquisitions' activities.

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.170
Each lecture is videotaped
and becomes part

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.210
of the permanent collections
here at the library.

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.560
In additions, the lectures
are later posted on webcasts,

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.290
on the library's website, where
they are available for viewing

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.600
to internet patrons
throughout the world.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.440
So now would be an excellent time
to turn off your phones [laughter],

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:30.610
so it don't come a permanent
record in our archives.

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.030
Thank you.

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.230
Located in Jonesborough, Tennessee,

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:36.180
the International Storytelling
Center

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.570
and its renowned storytelling
festival were founded in 1973.

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.900
And we are delighted to say
that the center's records

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:50.920
and historic recordings are
now part of AFC's archives.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.100
As a person who oversees the
AFC's Storytelling Collections

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.530
and particularly as
the person responsible

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.240
for processing the International
Storytelling Center's Collection,

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:10.840
today I am especially pleased
to introduce Kiran Singh Sirah.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:16.520
Who, from since 2011, has been the
International Storytelling Center's

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.750
executive director.

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.680
Kiran's diverse career history
includes works such as an artist,

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:29.400
curator, teacher, and he's
originally from the UK,

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.940
where he developed a number
of award-winning peace

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.630
and conflict-based programs

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.130
in British museums
and cultural centers.

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.950
His accomplishments
include developing folk-

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.660
and faith-based programs at
National Museums in Scotland

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.550
and creating several
high profile peace

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:53.350
and conflict resolution initiatives
exploring issues such as religion,

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:58.930
ethnic, and sectarian conflicts
in Scotland and now in Ireland.

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.070 position:56%
In his other [foreign accent]
projects, he has tackled such issues

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:07.230
as poverty, gang violence,
and modern-day slavery,

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.770
working with refugees affected
by war and persecution.

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:18.600 position:56%
Including social marginalized people
such as migrant Roma communities.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:24.080
Kiran went on to lead the Helen
Keller International Acts Award,

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.490
especially disability acts

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:31.100
of the Glasgow's Creative
UNESCO City of Music.

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.120
More recently, as a Rotary World
Peace Fellow, he has focused

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.620
on the folklore of homeless persons
throughout the shelter community,

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:44.420
exploring how to bring together an
international development community

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.240
with arts and culture.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.490
As a folklorist, he emphasizes
his interests in the power

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:54.250
of human creativity
arts and social justice.

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.280
And the notion of a truly
multicultural society.

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.960
Today, Mr Sirah will be talking
on the transformative power

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:07.450
of storytelling a social
force of social change.

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:12.510
Please join me in welcoming
Kiran Singh Sirah.

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:20.270
[ Applause ]

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:21.930
&gt;&gt; Kiran Singh Sirah:
Thank you so much Valda.

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.580
That's a great [inaudible],
who wrote that [laughter]?

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:29.390
I notice it's being
recorded, so I've got a tissue

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:31.590
because I've got allergies
so I don't want to run.

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.920
I'm sending this video
to my dad back home.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.310
But good afternoon everybody.

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:40.620 position:56%
It's wonderful to be here and
before I start, I just want to start

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.400
by first of all taking my
hat off to the entire team

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.460
at the American Folklife Center
here at the Library of Congress.

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:51.390
And to wish you all a
happy 40th birthday.

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:54.850
And it's also wonderful
to be part of your story

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:57.540
because it's also my
40th birthday next month,

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:59.880
so I get to celebrate my
birthday with you all.

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:05.080
I'd like to start off with
a quick show of hands.

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.030
How many of you consider
yourselves to be storytellers?

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:09.750
Okay. Great.

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:11.050
That's wonderful.

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:12.520
Thank you.

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.830
Where my line of work, I'm
inundated with stories all day,

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.190
every day, and I love it.

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:22.880
I believe passionately in the power
that stories and storytelling have

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.270
to bring peace, tolerance, and
understanding to our world.

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:28.520
I believe that we are
all storytellers

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.180
because we are the stories
of those that came after us,

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.310
those that came before us.

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:36.710
And as we all learn to listen,
collaborate, and engage,

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:40.310
and share our stories with each
other, all of us have the ability

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:42.870
to write our own storied script.

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:46.340
All of us in this room
are carriers of stories.

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:47.640
Stories are part of our DNA.

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:52.580 position:56%
We are all storytellers, hot-blooded
believers in the promises

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:54.690
of what storytelling can bring.

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:58.720
We are dreamers, disciples of
tradition, past and present.

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.400
We are artists, poets,

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.870
administrators, curators,
and citizens.

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:05.230
Or like me, a H1B resident
alien [laughter].

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:08.650
But regardless of who we
are or where we come from,

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:10.870
we are all advocates of culture.

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:13.060
My name is Kiran Singh,
and I'm the president

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:14.920
of the International
Storytelling Center based

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:16.730
in Jonesborough, Tennessee.

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:19.360
But as you can probably
tell by my accent,

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.470
I'm not originally from Tennessee.

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:24.790
I am, in fact, a newly
adopted Tennessean and before

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:27.610
that a Rotary Peace Fellow
based in North Carolina.

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:30.820
Before that an adopted new Scott
that made, lived and worked,

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:32.140
and made Scotland my home.

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:34.880
And before that an English-born
Sikh of British-Asian,

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:36.710
Indian, and African descent.

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:41.460
Descended from Kampala and Tororo
in Uganda, in Mombasa, Kenya,

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:46.340
and the villages of [foreign
words] in Punjab in northern India.

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:50.080
Now if you're confused
try celebrating Christmas,

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:53.050
[foreign words] or Dewali
at my house [laughter].

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:57.100
I have been with the International
Storytelling Center since 2013,

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:01.180
but my organization's work
began just over 40 years ago,

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:05.060
when a local high school teacher
called Jimmy Neil Smith decided he

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:06.940 position:56%
wanted to save a dying mountain town

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:09.160
by creating an annual
storytelling event

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.600
that he boldly called the
National Storytelling Festival.

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:14.430
Now that was a pretty
fancy name for something

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:16.630
that was literally 60 people
gathered around a wagon.

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:20.460
The stages were hay bales,
if you can believe it.

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:23.070
But there was enough magic
there to spark a movement

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:27.770
and something my predecessor likes
to call a storytelling revolution.

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:29.200
Storytelling revolution.

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:31.800
It kind of has a ring
to it, doesn't it?

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:35.000 position:56%
Well around the same time there were
less quaint revolutions happening

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.300
in other parts of the world.

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:38.560
And one of them involved
my own family.

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:42.800
They lived in Uganda at the
time and in the summer of 1972,

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:45.450
one year before the first
festival in Jonesborough

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:48.260
and four years before I was
born, there was an announcement

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.760
on Ugandan public radio
by then dictator Idi Amin.

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:54.760
And he declared that all
Ugandan Asians had three months

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:57.530
to leave the country or
they'll all be executed.

00:07:57.530 --> 00:08:01.360
Now that meant around 50,000
people, including my family,

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:03.770
had three months to
flee the country.

00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:05.460
Many fled the borders.

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:07.720
My family left for Britain.

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:10.160
They couldn't carry much but
what they could carry was taken

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:13.320
by robbers en route to the airport.

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:16.730
But having left behind all their
possessions and the tropical heat

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:20.280 position:56%
of East Africa, they arrived in a
small English town called Eastbourne

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:24.260
in the middle of a British winter,
and that was where I was born.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:27.380
As Ugandan refugees,
my parents stood out.

00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:30.430
My father wore a bright red turban
and a colorful African shirt

00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:32.760
and my mother an even
brighter red sari.

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:35.670
Later my dad told me about
overhearing a kid tell her mum,

00:08:35.670 --> 00:08:38.240
after seeing my dad,
look mum, aliens.

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:40.210
Meaning aliens from outer space.

00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:42.400
And my dad still loves
to tell that story.

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:45.420
Now for the most part,
the vast majority

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:48.720
of people were incredibly kind
and welcoming to my family.

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:51.390
But there were some that
were not so welcoming.

00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:54.630
There was racism, and it
existed in my small community.

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:57.670
But as a kid that's not
how you think of it.

00:08:57.670 --> 00:09:01.410
I just knew it was hard to
understand why I felt so different.

00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:04.560
Home was always a safe and
familiar space but whenever I had

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:08.770
to leave the house, I felt like I
had to be constantly on my guard.

00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:12.010
It was hard to concentrate at
school, and sometimes I ended

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:13.960
up causing trouble myself.

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:16.820
But things started to change
for me when my head teacher,

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:20.320
in a weekly school assembly,
started to tell stories.

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:22.490
Mr George was an older gentleman.

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:25.490
He was white, pretty much
like everyone else around me.

00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:29.710
He wore this tweed jacket and a
kind face, and he told us folktales

00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:31.960
and traditional stories
from all over the world,

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:34.200
and one of them really spoke to me.

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:38.710
It was about a prince who gives
up his worldly riches and goes

00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:40.440
out into the world
to explore the world,

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:41.900
and he takes two objects with him.

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:44.490
A cup and a toothbrush.

00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:47.450
One day, he looks out and sees
a man break a twig from a tree

00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:50.340
and chewing it to release these
juices that would clean his teeth.

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:52.970
And he realized he didn't
need his toothbrush anymore,

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:55.180
so he threw it away.

00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:58.490
Another day he sees
someone bent down by a river

00:09:58.490 --> 00:10:00.040
and cupping their hands
together in the shape

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:02.460
of a bowl to drink the water.

00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:04.490
So he threw his cup away as well,

00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:06.850
realizing he didn't
need that either.

00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:10.870
Listening to that story, I began to
observe a world in a different way.

00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:13.240
Not only did that story
help to paint a picture

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:16.520
of a world beyond what I already
knew or understood around me,

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:18.200
but it connected me to the idea

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:19.990
that perhaps the world
provides all the things

00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:21.970
that we need to live in it.

00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:24.450
That story turned my fear to hope.

00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:25.960
And it helped me see
the possibilities,

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:27.820
where before I'd seen
the challenges.

00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:30.920
It helped me see my own
family's difficult situation --

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:34.030
the idea that parents were
showing up in an unfamiliar country

00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:38.040
with just nothing but the clothes
on their back -- in a new way.

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:41.090
They didn't need material
things to connect to new people

00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:43.790
or have new experiences or
to remember the old ones.

00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:46.260
And I began to understand
myself, the world,

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:47.670
and my place in the world.

00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:51.160
And I started to see the outlines
of the story that I wanted to see

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:53.990
in the world and how I
can make that happen.

00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:55.430
Hearing that folktale, it felt

00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:57.860
like Mr George was
speaking directly to me.

00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:00.800
And I expect other students, in
totally different situations,

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:05.250
felt the same way, but that's
the magic of a good story.

00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:07.480
For me, these first stories
allowed me to grapple

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:10.930
with challenges then
and for what lay ahead.

00:11:10.930 --> 00:11:13.830
Through story I learnt to
channel anger, frustration,

00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:17.940
and anxiety into injustice
[inaudible] and inequality,

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:21.500
into forms of storied spoken
word and as a slam artist.

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:23.430
Because story is my tool.

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:27.060
Telling is my shield, my sword, my
passion, my inspiration to write,

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:30.530
to repeat, to shape, to
understand what I've heard.

00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:33.950
When we look beyond divisions and
labels in the societies we live in.

00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:36.590
When we think beyond borders
and groups and allow ourselves

00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:38.250
to embrace the wider world.

00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:40.550
We become international
citizens of the world.

00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:45.410
And we start to refigure and
reshape our stories with others.

00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:48.950
When I first thought it out
in museums, back in 2001,

00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:50.480
I met an education specialist.

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:52.790
I gave a talk at the
museum I worked in.

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:54.750
At the National Museum of Scotland.

00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:58.890
And he said the best way to connect
culture to the people was to break

00:11:58.890 --> 00:12:00.860
down the walls of the museum.

00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:03.580
Let material culture be free,
he said, and let people come

00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:06.040
and take what rightfully
belongs to them.

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:08.020
Now the idea resonated with me

00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:09.930
because here I was a
professional working

00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:12.210
in a major British
cultural institution.

00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:16.130
We had objects, thousands of
them, many contested objects

00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:19.650
that could be argued as stolen,
looted, or acquired illegally.

00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:22.960
If the British Museum were to give
back all of its objects like that,

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:25.710
it would actually lose
10% of its collections.

00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:29.800
But this was my first job in
a museum, my role as a curator

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:32.390
of education was to help
present Scotland to the world

00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:33.880
and the world to Scotland.

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:36.400
But to be honest, what
I was finding was

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:39.760
that many British museums often
conveyed imperial perspectives

00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:41.300
on British history.

00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:44.660
One such example was an
exhibition called Teas and Tigers

00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:46.970 position:56%
at the National Library of Scotland.

00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:50.250
Reading the intro panel, it
described the largest uprising

00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:53.130
against British rule
as the Indian Mutiny.

00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:57.480
As a person of color and
also a part of an empire,

00:12:57.480 --> 00:12:59.690
what was my position
on these issues?

00:12:59.690 --> 00:13:01.470
Whose side was I really on?

00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:03.740
And whose story do I help to tell?

00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:07.740
I knew for a fact that my ancestors
were not mutineers or pirates.

00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:11.330 position:56%
They were proud people who fought an
unjust system and helped free India

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:14.220
from British, including
Scottish occupation.

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:19.690
And to at least 2.5 million
people, British citizens with roots

00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:25.020
in South Asia, this was the first
significant war of independence.

00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:27.770
What a museum should
essentially do is to try

00:13:27.770 --> 00:13:29.930
to make sense of the
world around us.

00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:32.170
And lead us back outside,
with a greater

00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:35.600
or empathetic understanding
of the world we live in.

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:39.240
Not just our nation
but our changing world.

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:42.100
It's amazing how personal
paths and new directions

00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:44.410
and world events coincide.

00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:47.940
Soon after I started my
role, the world changed.

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:51.510
We sat round the TV and
watched Twin Towers collapse.

00:13:51.510 --> 00:13:55.250
Soon after a local mosque and a
local synagogue were firebombed.

00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:58.450
Some people were trying to stamp
out difference by attacking places

00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:00.920
of worship at the heart
of community.

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:03.360
Soon after, the curator
of the Islamic collections

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:05.040
and I received a letter
from a gentleman

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:08.720
from the Scottish Muslim community
concerned about what was happening.

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:12.080
He asked how we in the
museum could respond?

00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:15.560
So we took out the Yellow
Pages and called every place

00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:17.770
of worship in [inaudible].

00:14:17.770 --> 00:14:22.110
We invited imams, priests, rabbis,
Catholics, Protestants, Muslims,

00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:24.140
Sikhs, Buddhists, and Baha'is.

00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:28.410 position:56%
Six months later, a single event was
created through a festival format

00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:32.080
to explore faith and belief and
identity in the 21st century.

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:34.660
Where people of faith and
secular traditions stood side

00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:36.720
by side and told their stories.

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:40.320
Coptic Christians sang songs
of resurrection in Arabic.

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:42.180
Sikhs wore the Scottish Sikh tartan

00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:45.220
and performed traditional
bhangra with Scottish bagpipes.

00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:46.870
And Jewish Scotts performed music

00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:49.820
that combined Scottish
Celtic and Klezmer tradition.

00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:52.700
And in the way that humor
and meaning often coexist,

00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:54.510
they named their band
Celtica Shmeltica.

00:14:54.510 --> 00:14:57.710
[ Laughter ]

00:14:57.710 --> 00:15:01.680
In that one single event, on
that day, six months after 9/11,

00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:04.310
6,000 people of diverse faiths

00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:06.580
and backgrounds decided
to come together.

00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:07.890
To stand shoulder to shoulder.

00:15:07.890 --> 00:15:10.910
To use arts, cultures,
and personal storytelling

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:13.710
as a powerful expression
of community solidarity

00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:15.600
at such a time of difficulty.

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:20.170 position:56%
That experience helped me to
realize that if you work in culture,

00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:24.070
in whatever position, you're
a cultural diversity officer.

00:15:24.070 --> 00:15:25.370
It's not a choice.

00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:27.740
It's a responsibility.

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:30.990 position:56%
This realization informed [phonetic]
my work over the next few years,

00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:33.660
as I was appointed as a
public program curator

00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:36.210
for Glasgow City Museums
and Culture Services.

00:15:36.210 --> 00:15:40.260
Tasked to tackle social justice
issues in a city that has one

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:44.490
of the highest cluster of child
poverty in Europe, 360 gangs,

00:15:44.490 --> 00:15:46.590
and where the average
life expectancy for a man

00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:49.470
in the East End is
just 55 years old.

00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:54.290
In a city, within a nation,
riddled with a complex history

00:15:54.290 --> 00:15:56.690
of sectarian and ethnic division.

00:15:56.690 --> 00:16:00.300
It also involved cultural
connections

00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:03.410
through developing storytelling
approaches to societies emerging

00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:07.340
from conflict, with colleagues
from Belfast in Northern Ireland,

00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:10.420
as part of the peace and
reconciliation process.

00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:13.590
I was a first generation
immigrant leading a program

00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:15.570
that addressed a conflict
between Protestants

00:16:15.570 --> 00:16:18.620
and Catholics, white-on-white
violence.

00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:22.110
But as an outsider, as a brown
Asian, English-born Sikh living

00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:25.200
in Scotland of English,
Indian, and African descent.

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:27.770
I was able to use storytelling
and my own story

00:16:27.770 --> 00:16:30.640
to communicate the connection
between racism I experienced

00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:35.070
as a kid to the sectarian divisions
I was witnessing as an adult.

00:16:35.070 --> 00:16:37.230
Our projects evoked memories.

00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:40.010
I used stories actively collected
from people who were affected

00:16:40.010 --> 00:16:41.890
by the sectarian troubles.

00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:45.170
And when these participants,
including individuals, communities,

00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:48.070
and the wider culture
sector, museums and libraries,

00:16:48.070 --> 00:16:51.830
arts organizations, with support
from political leadership,

00:16:51.830 --> 00:16:53.990
began to invest and
recognize the value

00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:56.830
of the storytelling process
in healing community.

00:16:56.830 --> 00:17:00.510
We were able to collectively
build an effective community model

00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:04.190
that has helped to envision
a new 21st century identity.

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:07.260
Not to ignore the past, but
to reveal it in new ways

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:09.660
and as part of a global community.

00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:13.300
These stories were the base of
connections and relationships,

00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:16.490
with community leaders,
ex-paramilitary groups,

00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:19.820
territorial gang members,
politicians, police officers,

00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:21.520
people of all different faiths.

00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:23.620 position:56%
To not only collect and tell stories

00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:25.930
but to encourage them
to tell theirs.

00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:29.520 position:56%
What might be seen as a mundane
everyday story also offered powerful

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:33.100
ways to explore and thread stories
together, like the Scottish saying.

00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:36.170
There are many threads
of this tartan.

00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:39.870
Enabled important discussions
within a safe environment.

00:17:39.870 --> 00:17:44.380 position:56%
Storytelling offers a search for the
common ground and a place to find

00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:46.300
that important meeting space.

00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:50.410
To allow people to seek freedom
by starting to be free in our mind

00:17:50.410 --> 00:17:53.470
and igniting our imagination.

00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:57.350
Envisioning the world without
conflict is hard to do.

00:17:57.350 --> 00:18:00.250
But through story, we can
paint a picture of a world

00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:02.120
for ourselves and for others.

00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:03.840
That is possible.

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:07.290
This is a process that can
take place between two people,

00:18:07.290 --> 00:18:09.800
two communities, or two countries.

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:11.100
It can scale up.

00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:13.220
It can scale down.

00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:15.750
But this doesn't always
mean it's easy.

00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:18.250
Using the arts takes
a level of thick skin

00:18:18.250 --> 00:18:19.870
and conviction in our art form.

00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:24.680
The first time I tried to bring in
two rival gangs in a museum space

00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:26.260
to share their stories, they broke

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:29.330
out into an all-out
fight with each other.

00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:33.100
But with commitment to building
community we tried again.

00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:36.580
And with specialist support
from partners and city leaders

00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:38.890
that saw the full potential
of storytelling,

00:18:38.890 --> 00:18:41.910
including social workers,
community development officers,

00:18:41.910 --> 00:18:43.300
police officials.

00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:46.120
We developed ways in which
fostered story-based relationships

00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:50.280
that continue to be used to this
day in citywide gang and peace

00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:53.250
and community reconciliation
programs.

00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:56.340 position:56%
Models that are now being shared and
storied approaches in building peace

00:18:56.340 --> 00:19:01.010 position:56%
in the Middle East between Arab,
Israeli, Muslim, Christian, and Jew.

00:19:01.010 --> 00:19:03.730
The approach was to see art,
culture, and creativity,

00:19:03.730 --> 00:19:07.300
the process of story-making, not
as a tool to conquer or divide

00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:10.860
but instead as a way to heal, to
come together to form community.

00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:12.210
To have a voice.

00:19:12.210 --> 00:19:17.240
To impart wisdom, sometimes ancient
wisdom through the tales we tell.

00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:20.090
To follow a belief that in
fact we are all storytellers.

00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:23.250
It's just about what type of
storyteller we want to be.

00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:26.060
And that humble approach
led to big things.

00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:29.070
The program we started is now
recognized by UNESCO, the Scottish

00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:32.230
and Northern Ireland
governments, and is now has had

00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:34.480
around 90,000 people
that have participated

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:36.070
in to tackle bigger
[inaudible] sectarian

00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:38.420 position:56%
and ethnic divisions, gang violence.

00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:42.590
It's recognized by her Majesty's
Inspectorate for Education.

00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:45.870
From the time when humans
picked up colored rocks

00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:49.550
and etched visual pictographs
onto cave walls to the day

00:19:49.550 --> 00:19:52.460
when NASA scientists inscribe
the visual human story

00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:56.360
onto a pioneer space probe and
sent it out into the universe,

00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:58.370
humans have told stories.

00:19:58.370 --> 00:20:03.770
Storytelling offers us a way to
connect to other ways of life.

00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:06.360
To the organic world, with
the forest mountains and seas,

00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:08.080
in which our tales take place.

00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:10.850
To the walls in libraries
and corridors of our museums,

00:20:10.850 --> 00:20:13.290
our churches, our mosques,
our synagogues,

00:20:13.290 --> 00:20:15.350
and other places of worship.

00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:19.840
As a museum professional living in
Scotland since 2001, my colleagues

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:23.300
and I, around 2004, were
looking at how we could plan

00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:27.730
to mark the 2007 bicentennial
year commemorating the abolition

00:20:27.730 --> 00:20:29.030
of the British slave trade.

00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:31.090
It was an important year.

00:20:31.090 --> 00:20:33.660
Especially as I was
now living in Glasgow,

00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:36.360
also known as the Second
City of the empire.

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:38.900
But for whom many people did not
realize was built on the back

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:40.930
of transatlantic slavery.

00:20:40.930 --> 00:20:46.990 position:56%
In 2004, I got to hear Lonnie Bunch,
and we invited him to Scotland

00:20:46.990 --> 00:20:49.420
to speak at the UK-wide
museums conference.

00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:53.700
At that time he was the president
of the Chicago Historical Society

00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:56.380
and now, of course, the thinker
behind the new African-American

00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:59.080
Museum being built
on DC's museum mall.

00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:02.260
He said one cannot tackle
racism without grappling

00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:03.560
with the legacies of slavery.

00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:05.280 position:56%
Yet few want to actually discuss it.

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:08.090
I was inspired by his words.

00:21:08.090 --> 00:21:11.410
I realized that, as a person
of color and as a product

00:21:11.410 --> 00:21:14.210
of empire that, I was
in a unique position

00:21:14.210 --> 00:21:16.470
to facilitate those discussions.

00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:19.520
I wanted to take what people
think as two opposing sides

00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:23.050
of a conversation and
put them into dialogue.

00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:26.000
Lonnie Bunch helped
to spark an idea.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.700
We couldn't literally return these
objects to their rightful owners,

00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:32.350
so we did the next best thing.

00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:36.570
An invitation went out to invite
the members of the African diaspora

00:21:36.570 --> 00:21:39.240
to interpret those objects instead.

00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:41.190
Many of those objects
from museum collections

00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:43.970
that had been historically or
been collected and interpret

00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:48.210
through only Western institutional
Eurocentric structures.

00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:51.920
An African Voices Exhibition
sought to reinterpret these objects

00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:55.910
from first person narratives of
artists and poets and musicians,

00:21:55.910 --> 00:21:58.060
refugees and members of the 30,000

00:21:58.060 --> 00:22:00.910
or so African Scottish
diaspora community.

00:22:00.910 --> 00:22:05.380
The project itself was an attempt,
for some of us on the inside,

00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:08.130 position:56%
to relinquish institutional control.

00:22:08.130 --> 00:22:10.230 position:56%
By provoking diverse interpretations

00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:12.850
of the esthetics of
cultural property.

00:22:12.850 --> 00:22:16.210
This work challenged the idea
of static culture and sought

00:22:16.210 --> 00:22:18.690
to utilize contemporary
traditions drawn from African

00:22:18.690 --> 00:22:20.520
and Caribbean folk traditions.

00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:24.640
Including developing a
Glasgow Haitian voodoo alter,

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:28.300
a Rastafari reggae sound system,
and a commission of new artworks

00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:31.310
for the museum collections on
themes of products of slavery.

00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:33.490
By working with artists
of mixed British

00:22:33.490 --> 00:22:36.170
and African-Caribbean heritage.

00:22:36.170 --> 00:22:39.470
[Inaudible] Ford was one of those
artists that was commissioned

00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:41.730
to respond to the yearlong program.

00:22:41.730 --> 00:22:44.940
An artist of mixed
Barbadian and British descent,

00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:48.900
she used her own body, her own
story, as someone of mixed heritage

00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:54.100
to explore herself as an artist,
as a woman, as a legacy of slavery.

00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:56.280
Ford's installation The Shadow

00:22:56.280 --> 00:23:00.650
of the Object Fell Upon the Ego
used photography and sculptures

00:23:00.650 --> 00:23:04.630
to explore identity and loss by
enacting the experience of slavery

00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:07.020
as a violent suppression
of identity.

00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:09.350
She created a series of
powerful installations

00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:13.330
which included a masked self
portrait wearing a slave mask.

00:23:13.330 --> 00:23:15.770
Taken from the museum's
collections originally used

00:23:15.770 --> 00:23:17.650
as a form of punishment.

00:23:17.650 --> 00:23:21.140
Ford described her artwork
as symbolizing the human cost

00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:25.060
of the slave trade and the
prejudice that remains today.

00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:28.770
There was only so far we
could go without breaking

00:23:28.770 --> 00:23:30.810
down the walls of the museum.

00:23:30.810 --> 00:23:34.130
But we could utilize the
museum as the object itself.

00:23:34.130 --> 00:23:37.920
As a cultural space to
challenge racism and other forms

00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:39.820
of crimes against humanity.

00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:41.900
And how we could that
by unpacking how much

00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:44.240
of Scotland made its
fortune on the back

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:47.260
of what many referred
to as tobacco slavery.

00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:49.000
By encouraging us and
others to listen

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.660
for what I believe is the most
important cultural artifact

00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:53.180
for any museum.

00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:57.480
People. By incorporating
diverse and uncomfortable stories

00:23:57.480 --> 00:24:00.980
and presenting how much of
Scotland's empire was in fact built

00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:04.030
on the blood and sweat of
people that were once enslaved.

00:24:04.030 --> 00:24:08.120
And how that legacy remains
with us today in various forms.

00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:12.720
As cultural advocates, as
curators, as festival coordinators,

00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:14.230
as public administrators.

00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:16.750
It's vital that we gather
and assemble people's stories

00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:19.130
to help our audience
listen in new ways.

00:24:19.130 --> 00:24:22.670
As institutions of culture, it's
important that we share history,

00:24:22.670 --> 00:24:27.020
in all its multiplicity, not
shape it into tiny narratives.

00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:30.500 position:56%
Harnessing the power of storytelling
to build a better world is not easy,

00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:33.100
but I believe it's an
idea worth cultivating.

00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:36.340
We want to empower people all over
the world to tell their stories

00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:38.120
and to hear about other
people's stories.

00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:39.420
To really listen.

00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:40.830
Because when we think about it,

00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:43.790
it's an art where you don't
need special equipment

00:24:43.790 --> 00:24:45.880
or costumes or anything really.

00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:49.570
And like Mr George's story had
taught me as a kid in school,

00:24:49.570 --> 00:24:52.780 position:56%
you don't even need a toothbrush or
a cup because the world provides you

00:24:52.780 --> 00:24:55.080
with everything you need.

00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:57.980
In my work and in my life,
I'm incredibly fortunate,

00:24:57.980 --> 00:24:59.790
at the local level
to go into schools

00:24:59.790 --> 00:25:03.340 position:56%
and to help classrooms truly
understand this country's remarkable

00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:04.880
cultural heritage.

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:07.550
And to work with healthcare
providers, to use story to connect

00:25:07.550 --> 00:25:09.640
with their patients and
to help foster healing.

00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:13.420
On a global level, I get to work
with key partners and collaborators

00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:16.080
to help spread that
storytelling revolution.

00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:19.200
Places like the Smithsonian
Institution, NASA,

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:22.180 position:56%
the National Endowment for the
Arts, the Google Cultural Institute,

00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:23.810
the Desmond Tutu Peace Foundation,

00:25:23.810 --> 00:25:26.420
and the United Nations,
and many others.

00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:29.690
And to work with our friends here
at the American Folklife Center

00:25:29.690 --> 00:25:31.440
at the Library of Congress,
to help preserve

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:33.810
and digitize years'
worth of archives.

00:25:33.810 --> 00:25:36.810
To promote storytelling, not
only as a traditional folk art

00:25:36.810 --> 00:25:39.060
but to further it as a
contemporary practice.

00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:40.830
And through our connection
we've a network

00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:42.580
of Rotary World Peace Fellows.

00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:45.520
We get to support groups and
communities around the globe,

00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:47.730
such as the indigenous
communities of the Amazon,

00:25:47.730 --> 00:25:49.620 position:56%
and help empower marginalized people

00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:51.110
to share their stories
with the world.

00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:52.410
And why do we do that?

00:25:52.410 --> 00:25:54.290
We do it because stories matter.

00:25:54.290 --> 00:25:56.590
And I believe they matter a lot.

00:25:56.590 --> 00:26:00.340 position:56%
Through storytelling and, in my
work, I have seen how we can give --

00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:03.090
if we can, we give it a go.

00:26:03.090 --> 00:26:06.040
We can give precedence to
historical accountability.

00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:09.870
To offer healing and reconciliation
to the oppressed and the afflicted

00:26:09.870 --> 00:26:12.790
in ways that open heart of
listeners and enable us to share

00:26:12.790 --> 00:26:14.390
and embrace social change.

00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:17.290
And think about the connection
between social justice,

00:26:17.290 --> 00:26:21.760
community building, activism, and
across arts and cultural alliances.

00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:25.130
In my work, I've seen how we can
use storytelling to unravel some

00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:27.950
of our underlying societal
challenges and the foundations

00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:30.110
for prejudice that exist today.

00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:35.570
How the voices of those sidelined
from history refuse to conform,

00:26:35.570 --> 00:26:38.800
to be beaten down by those
with power over them.

00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:43.150 position:56%
How the small but powerful defiant
acts across time became work chants,

00:26:43.150 --> 00:26:47.340 position:56%
quilt makers, folk tellers, graffiti
artists that told visual stories

00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:49.760
on subway trains, and
was used to empower

00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:51.690
and form communities of their own.

00:26:51.690 --> 00:26:55.150
Or those that managed to put ink
to paper or how artists turn paper

00:26:55.150 --> 00:26:58.510
to pulp to those that scribe and
scratched and carved story circles

00:26:58.510 --> 00:27:00.710
into rocks or circled
rocks into sand.

00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:04.190
To those that turned stories from
the margins of society and learned

00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:06.560
to play lead guitar in a
band and gifted the world

00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:09.820
with Delta Mississippi or Chicago
Blues, the slam poet, [inaudible],

00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:12.600
the Appalachian Ballad, [inaudible]

00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:14.650
to protest [inaudible]
or Indian song.

00:27:14.650 --> 00:27:17.640
Because when we think about
it, we cannot tackle racism

00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:20.290
without unpacking the legacies
of slavery and oppression

00:27:20.290 --> 00:27:22.620
in our modern day institutions.

00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:25.190
When we think about it,
we cannot tackle sexism

00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:27.640
without unraveling the way
that gender has been told

00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:30.280
in the stories we've
been told all our lives.

00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:33.450
When we think about it, we cannot
tackle bigotry without looking

00:27:33.450 --> 00:27:37.200
at the stories of our
historical shared and global past.

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:40.170
And when we really think about
it, we cannot tackle violations

00:27:40.170 --> 00:27:43.050
of universal human rights
without listening to the stories

00:27:43.050 --> 00:27:47.040
of all those that have been
stripped of their human dignity.

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:48.720
One story from Ferguson [phonetic].

00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:50.220
One story from Baltimore.

00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:52.050
One story from Charleston,
South Carolina.

00:27:52.050 --> 00:27:55.210
Pull these stories together and
collect we shape the narrative.

00:27:55.210 --> 00:27:58.090
The narrative that builds the
movement and ultimately use story

00:27:58.090 --> 00:28:01.400
to promote the idea that telling
stories matter because the Arc

00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:04.500
of [inaudible] universe is
long but bends towards justice.

00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:08.760
As one great civil rights leader
that stood in 1963 on the steps

00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:13.850
of the Lincoln Memorial once said
a leader that truly knew the power

00:28:13.850 --> 00:28:16.140
of story to inspire change.

00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:19.270
Our stories help us as
we refigure, reshape,

00:28:19.270 --> 00:28:22.000
and redefine our flexibility
identities.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.860
Moving from place to
place, city to city,

00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:27.540
country to country, to
form new communities.

00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:33.750
When someone asks you what's your
story, you can reply which one?

00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:36.440
Because all of us stem from
traditions that span thousands

00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:38.670
of years to [inaudible] beginnings.

00:28:38.670 --> 00:28:41.420
We all have stories to share
from the wisdom of folk

00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:43.920
and traditional tales that
we carry from our families,

00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:45.940
our tribes, our traditions.

00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:48.840
The stories that speak of
40,000-year-old civilizations

00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:52.140
from Africa, Asia, Europe,
and other parts of the world,

00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:54.340
to the indigenous stories
all across this nation

00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:56.150
to the stories of this place.

00:28:56.150 --> 00:29:00.860
We have entered an era of
conflict that is taking new forms

00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:03.300
and spreading in ways that
are outstripping the power

00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:06.050
of the international
community to respond.

00:29:06.050 --> 00:29:09.950
As ISIS spreads across the
Middle East, and we see Ebola

00:29:09.950 --> 00:29:14.000
in rural West Africa, and
conflict destabilize Ukraine.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.430 position:56%
And here in the US, hate speech and
its consequence effects causing harm

00:29:18.430 --> 00:29:21.260
to the idea of living
in a harmonious society.

00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:25.240 position:56%
As some of these factors harness the
power of story to join young people

00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:27.160
into their dangerous ideology,

00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:30.440
it is clear that we need
new conceptual lenses

00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:32.230
and creative approaches
for how we can think

00:29:32.230 --> 00:29:35.860
about the way we can collectively
build peace, mutual respect

00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:37.780
and understanding,
and prevent conflict

00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:39.870 position:56%
from taking hold in our communities.

00:29:39.870 --> 00:29:42.580
So not to only reveal
stories that matter

00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:44.990
but also in places that matter.

00:29:44.990 --> 00:29:48.460
Such as the many cultural arenas
such as museums and libraries,

00:29:48.460 --> 00:29:51.110
national storytelling festivals,
that present the stories

00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:56.400
of who we are, where we come from,
and importantly, where we're going.

00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:59.330 position:56%
We can never underestimate the power
of using our stories when we know

00:29:59.330 --> 00:30:02.130
that a world of peace comes
from a state of empathy,

00:30:02.130 --> 00:30:06.190 position:56%
a state of belonging, shared notions
of joy, happiness and suffering,

00:30:06.190 --> 00:30:09.710
all of which are fundamentally
part of the human condition.

00:30:09.710 --> 00:30:13.070
To deconstruct the stories that
are destructive and enable us

00:30:13.070 --> 00:30:16.040
to transform stories
into the constructive,

00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:20.240
even if in that very moment
it's hard to see that potential.

00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:24.120 position:56%
I've learnt, however, that sometimes
in tragedy, there are small seeds

00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:27.380
of hope that give rise to
new stories of opportunity.

00:30:27.380 --> 00:30:30.300
After 9/11 in New York
City, when all visits

00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:34.220
to visit attractions
declined, apart from one space.

00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:38.280
The Islamic galleries of the New
York City Metropolitan Museum.

00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:41.210
Why? Because humans
are curious beings.

00:30:41.210 --> 00:30:43.700
We want to seek out the
truth for ourselves.

00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:46.090
We are smart because we
have a desire to learn

00:30:46.090 --> 00:30:48.240
about cultures we hear
about in the news,

00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:50.940
so that we may form
our own opinions.

00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:53.310
That's why finding
diverse and creative ways

00:30:53.310 --> 00:30:57.310
to invent stories [inaudible] of
other people's lives is important,

00:30:57.310 --> 00:30:59.660
and it's also why one of
the most popular museums

00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:02.980
in this nation is the
National Holocaust Museum.

00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:05.750 position:56%
We don't go there to be entertained.

00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:07.890
We go there because we're
trying to understand and grapple

00:31:07.890 --> 00:31:11.720
with the story of who we
are, as one human family.

00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:16.560
And how we, as humans, on one hand,
can be so incredibly destructive.

00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:20.540
But how we can also perhaps learn
to shape our common human desire

00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:24.050
to live in a peaceful
and conflict-free world.

00:31:24.050 --> 00:31:28.320
And that's part of the reason I
wanted to share my story with you

00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:31.080
because I think this work of
telling stories is important,

00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:35.010
at the level of the individual
and not just the institution.

00:31:35.010 --> 00:31:37.130
I was born in England.

00:31:37.130 --> 00:31:39.870
My mother was born in
Kenya, my father in India,

00:31:39.870 --> 00:31:41.390
and my brother in Uganda.

00:31:41.390 --> 00:31:44.410
I have this longtime belief
that not only is my family

00:31:44.410 --> 00:31:47.950
like a mini-United Nations,
but we are all storytellers.

00:31:47.950 --> 00:31:51.910
We keep the old traditions alive,
but we're always finding new ones.

00:31:51.910 --> 00:31:55.270
From as long as I can remember we
have drawn from our experiences,

00:31:55.270 --> 00:31:58.320
our global traditions, and
cross-cultural thinking.

00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:00.780 position:56%
Stories are always crossing borders.

00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:04.880
I've spent the first part of my
career in Scotland and now here

00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:07.380
in the United States
with my own stories

00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:09.220
and the stories I've
inherited from my family.

00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:13.340
And there are many ways we can
do that through personal story,

00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:15.630 position:56%
through folktale, pieces of history,

00:32:15.630 --> 00:32:18.520
and other forms we haven't
even thought of yet.

00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:22.330
The stories past to me became
my vehicle to know that love

00:32:22.330 --> 00:32:24.720
and hope will always conquer hate.

00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:28.320 position:56%
And that the business of the world's
most ancient art form, storytelling,

00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:33.200
has the potential and power to
make a difference if used wisely.

00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:36.010
I'm the proud son of refugees.

00:32:36.010 --> 00:32:39.130
But I'm also part of the immigrant
community that has a great fortune

00:32:39.130 --> 00:32:42.510
to make England, Ireland,
Spain, Scotland, North Carolina,

00:32:42.510 --> 00:32:45.030
and now East Tennessee my home.

00:32:45.030 --> 00:32:48.910 position:56%
But in the way we might craft for
ourselves a sense of home, identity,

00:32:48.910 --> 00:32:53.040
and belonging in the ways we know
how, we can also use our stories

00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:55.780
to reach our full artistic
and creative potential

00:32:55.780 --> 00:33:00.920
to cross boundaries of
ethnicity, race, and social class.

00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:05.070
To listen to courage and voices
vexed about social apartheid.

00:33:05.070 --> 00:33:07.170
And use our stories to
put the dream, desire,

00:33:07.170 --> 00:33:10.450
and struggle of what it
means to be human into words.

00:33:10.450 --> 00:33:12.710
To help us all build
a collective, diverse,

00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:16.910
and plural society
that we all wish for.

00:33:16.910 --> 00:33:21.800
In December last year, I was in
Washington, DC, co-leading an arts

00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:23.240
and peacebuilding program at one

00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:26.110
of our Smithsonian
Institution partners.

00:33:26.110 --> 00:33:28.920
On my last full day there,
I carved out some time

00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:31.810
to walk alone through
this great city.

00:33:31.810 --> 00:33:34.850
It was quickly getting
dark, but before moving

00:33:34.850 --> 00:33:37.910
to my final destination that
evening, I took a moment

00:33:37.910 --> 00:33:40.900
to stand still on the
Washington Monument Hill

00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:42.680
with the Lincoln Memorial behind me

00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:44.970
and the Capitol Hill
way out in front.

00:33:44.970 --> 00:33:48.910
Streams of airplane dust lined the
sky as I bent my neck backwards

00:33:48.910 --> 00:33:51.270
to get in a view of
the emerging night sky.

00:33:51.270 --> 00:33:53.810
And I waited there until
the sun began to set

00:33:53.810 --> 00:33:56.090
over these magnificent
historic buildings.

00:33:56.090 --> 00:33:58.750
Another day like thousands
of others of life and love

00:33:58.750 --> 00:34:01.070
that this city has been witness to.

00:34:01.070 --> 00:34:04.550
Standing there [inaudible] cold, I
looked out at the National Museum

00:34:04.550 --> 00:34:06.910
of African-American
History and Culture,

00:34:06.910 --> 00:34:08.210
currently under construction.

00:34:08.210 --> 00:34:10.240
And I thought back to
that speech in 2004,

00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:13.500
when I got to hear its
founder, Lonnie Bunch,

00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:17.720
give that inspiring speech at
museum conference in Scotland.

00:34:17.720 --> 00:34:20.920
And I thought back to what
he said about the value

00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:24.420
of using all our cultural
spaces, all our peoples

00:34:24.420 --> 00:34:29.440
to help society unpack and wrestle
with our societal challenges.

00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:31.900
Before I came to the United
States, I had often thought

00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:35.730
that America's immigration
story began at Ellis Island.

00:34:35.730 --> 00:34:38.480
This was at the forefront of what
I'd been told and what I learned.

00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:41.950
But after being in this country
and having had a chance to listen

00:34:41.950 --> 00:34:45.640 position:56%
and connect with others, I also know
that for 40% of people that descend

00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:48.710
from enslaved people, an American
story came through the ports

00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:50.890
of Charleston, South Carolina.

00:34:50.890 --> 00:34:54.890 position:56%
Telling stories is not solely about
a single place or a single tradition

00:34:54.890 --> 00:34:57.950
but something that connects with
something much more profound.

00:34:57.950 --> 00:35:01.730 position:56%
It plays a crucial role in binding
and helping communities to flourish.

00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:05.080
Things that are essential to help
us understand how we can improve

00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:07.440
and better our world.

00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:11.000
Museums, as the one under
construction, I think will help all

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:14.600
of us to think about how a museum
could help people not just hearing

00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:16.570
new stories about American history

00:35:16.570 --> 00:35:18.390
but hear the stories
that already exist.

00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:22.170
That have often sat on the
margins and are thankfully slowly

00:35:22.170 --> 00:35:24.890
but surely becoming part
of mainstream culture

00:35:24.890 --> 00:35:27.060
and shaping the way that we think.

00:35:27.060 --> 00:35:30.020
Because diversity and true
multiculturalism [inaudible]

00:35:30.020 --> 00:35:32.840
about the integration
of diverse ideas.

00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:35.700
We cannot change a
narrative by ourselves.

00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:37.870
But by telling our
stories we can contribute

00:35:37.870 --> 00:35:39.650
to a plurality of viewpoints.

00:35:39.650 --> 00:35:43.350
To help build new narrative
arcs that bend towards justice.

00:35:43.350 --> 00:35:44.860
By telling our stories as a force

00:35:44.860 --> 00:35:47.370
to shift our minds
and excite our world.

00:35:47.370 --> 00:35:48.980
To challenge the status quo.

00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:53.640
And when necessary, kick a good
old mighty storm for a story,

00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:57.140
but most importantly, we can use
storytelling to build bridges.

00:35:57.140 --> 00:36:00.200
We need to do with
others, with ourselves,

00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:03.950
and others that share
beliefs in equality for all.

00:36:03.950 --> 00:36:06.090
I'm here today to share
an important message.

00:36:06.090 --> 00:36:08.690
That each and every one
of us is a storyteller.

00:36:08.690 --> 00:36:11.560
As storytellers we walk into
the hot winds of the world

00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:14.090
and we pull our stories from
the heart, from our blood,

00:36:14.090 --> 00:36:17.300
for the ones before us that
poured their stories into us.

00:36:17.300 --> 00:36:19.560
We all have the opportunity
to use our stories in big

00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:21.670
and small ways that are important.

00:36:21.670 --> 00:36:24.150
We can use them to connect
with our families, our friends,

00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:26.260
our coworkers, and our communities.

00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:29.070
We can use stories as a binding
force whenever there is conflict

00:36:29.070 --> 00:36:31.070
in the world because we
can all be the stories

00:36:31.070 --> 00:36:32.760
that we want to see in the world.

00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:35.190
And we can help others,
too, just by listening.

00:36:35.190 --> 00:36:38.620
Because the power of story will
be with you wherever you go.

00:36:38.620 --> 00:36:41.920
Because when it comes down to it,
to tell a story is an act of love,

00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:43.860
that I believe, matters
to the world.

00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:45.660
Thank you all for listening.

00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:52.430
[ Applause ]

00:36:52.430 --> 00:36:54.230

[ Applause ]

00:36:56.830 --> 00:37:01.200
How long was that [laughter]?

00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:03.020
So I'm actually -- sorry?

00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:07.040
So I'm actually very open to any
questions that you might have.

00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:09.450
Please don't make them too
difficult or use really long words.

00:37:09.450 --> 00:37:11.100
But I'm open to any questions.

00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:14.080
And it's really nice to see so
many friends in the audience.

00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:16.520
We've got National Endowment for
the Arts, Spoken Traditional Arts.

00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:19.000
We've got the Smithsonian
Institution.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.350
We've got Patty from
Journal of American Folklore.

00:37:21.350 --> 00:37:23.980
We've got folklorists
and all sorts of people.

00:37:23.980 --> 00:37:25.840
And many of you storytellers.

00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:29.200 position:56%
So anything that goes, ask anything.

00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:31.310
I'm not a US citizen, so I can
leave anytime [laughter], right?

00:37:31.310 --> 00:37:36.510
Danielle. She was my
professor, by the way.

00:37:36.510 --> 00:38:06.600
[ Inaudible Question ]

00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:08.930
&gt;&gt; Kiran Singh Sirah: There
was many different levels,

00:38:08.930 --> 00:38:14.400
and one of the things that I --
I'm trying to fit this into a kind

00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:17.580
of good answer for you but I'm also
thinking about other things that --

00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:19.060
when I first came to the country,

00:38:19.060 --> 00:38:23.220
there was a leading folklore
[inaudible], Elaine [inaudible].

00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:25.670
And she said to me
once when I was like --

00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:27.860
it's like you're in a
very unique position

00:38:27.860 --> 00:38:30.560
because so many [inaudible]
folklore as an anthropologist is

00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:32.830
to go an study the minority group.

00:38:32.830 --> 00:38:34.860
African-American or
Lithuanian-American

00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:36.350
or to go to other countries.

00:38:36.350 --> 00:38:37.650
But who studies America?

00:38:37.650 --> 00:38:38.950
Who looks at America?

00:38:38.950 --> 00:38:41.540
And as a person of color,
with this British accent,

00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:46.350 position:56%
you can be in a position to use
that skill to be able to facilitate.

00:38:46.350 --> 00:38:48.830
So make sure you use it wisely.

00:38:48.830 --> 00:38:50.350
And I think back to
that because back

00:38:50.350 --> 00:38:52.930 position:56%
in Scotland, here was British brown.

00:38:52.930 --> 00:38:54.670
I wasn't Catholic or Protestant.

00:38:54.670 --> 00:38:56.670
So when I first got into Glasgow,

00:38:56.670 --> 00:38:58.670
the first thing, I
was on a subway train.

00:38:58.670 --> 00:39:02.480 position:56%
And people were singing the song
hello, hello, we are the Biddy Boys.

00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:04.890
Surrender or you'll die.

00:39:04.890 --> 00:39:06.500
It's a sectarian song.

00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:08.970
It's a anti-Catholic song.

00:39:08.970 --> 00:39:13.610 position:56%
But the thing I saw at everybody on
that train was that people just kind

00:39:13.610 --> 00:39:15.780
of accepted oh, it's them.

00:39:15.780 --> 00:39:17.720
And no, we don't accept it.

00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:21.170
And I think there was so much of
an attitude for 3 million people

00:39:21.170 --> 00:39:22.690
that this is the way it is.

00:39:22.690 --> 00:39:27.750
It's the way it's always been, and
we just have to put up with it.

00:39:27.750 --> 00:39:34.000
The first approach really
was going out collecting.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:35.710
We did a lot of collecting.

00:39:35.710 --> 00:39:38.330
And I say some were
unorthodox ways of collecting.

00:39:38.330 --> 00:39:40.860
Going to the Glasgow
Barras [phonetic] markets.

00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:44.110
Going behind the counter and
picking up a sectarian merchandise

00:39:44.110 --> 00:39:48.100
that the guy was selling, but he
would only sell it as like a scarf.

00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:50.980
A Celtic scarf that
God's chosen people.

00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:54.090
Or stuff that would be the
sectarian-related about the IRA

00:39:54.090 --> 00:39:55.390
or the UDA, the paramilitaries.

00:39:55.390 --> 00:39:58.910
We collected these objects,
but we also looked at song.

00:39:58.910 --> 00:40:03.000
And some of the songs, the
ballads, that were used for such

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:08.030
as Greenfields of France, which is
an Irish song, an Irish folk song.

00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:10.820
Talks about the Great War,
not about the troubles.

00:40:10.820 --> 00:40:14.170
So what it does do, is a song
that unites different communities

00:40:14.170 --> 00:40:15.720
that live across divisions.

00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:20.780
But many people not realizing that
it's sung in the pubs and the homes

00:40:20.780 --> 00:40:22.330
and the social gatherings.

00:40:22.330 --> 00:40:28.140
It's a song that unites cultural
difference by a number of series

00:40:28.140 --> 00:40:30.180
of collections, but I'd say a big,

00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:33.460
big part of that was
city leadership.

00:40:33.460 --> 00:40:36.750
Because what happened
was Jack McConnell,

00:40:36.750 --> 00:40:40.650
who was the First Minister at
the time, he was Protestant,

00:40:40.650 --> 00:40:43.400
married to a Catholic, Bridget
McConnell, who was the leader

00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:45.380
of the Cultural and Leisure
Services for Glasgow.

00:40:45.380 --> 00:40:49.120
I knew that sectarianism
was becoming a hot topic.

00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:51.170 position:56%
People didn't know how to tackle it.

00:40:51.170 --> 00:40:54.220
My own institution was 80%
Roman Catholic in a city

00:40:54.220 --> 00:40:57.740
with 26% Roman Catholics,
six percent of Scotland.

00:40:57.740 --> 00:41:01.680
But it's historic so it's seen
as a sectarian institution.

00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:05.850
So how do we -- but I knew it was
becoming a topic that was going

00:41:05.850 --> 00:41:08.540
to get funding as well
and political support.

00:41:08.540 --> 00:41:11.910
So it was about working with
the Scottish government,

00:41:11.910 --> 00:41:15.130
building those connections, and
also [inaudible] leadership.

00:41:15.130 --> 00:41:17.410
Mark O'Neill , who was
the head of the museums

00:41:17.410 --> 00:41:19.500
and gallery service
was a forward figure.

00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:21.810
He was an Irish man, so
he was a forward thinker.

00:41:21.810 --> 00:41:25.750
And he employed many of us as
community workers, social workers,

00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:29.990
education specialists, to get
higher pay in the museum service

00:41:29.990 --> 00:41:33.590
because we understood the
connection between people and how

00:41:33.590 --> 00:41:35.670
to make a partnership
of health organization,

00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:36.970
community organizations.

00:41:36.970 --> 00:41:40.150
So rather than having just
14 museums, 46 libraries,

00:41:40.150 --> 00:41:43.030
we also had partnerships with
health centers, community centers.

00:41:43.030 --> 00:41:45.640
So it was a much more
strategic approach.

00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:49.970
When you have that backing,
you allow it to take risks.

00:41:49.970 --> 00:41:52.470
Many of the different ways
was setting up a program.

00:41:52.470 --> 00:41:54.690
I talk about my own first
experience was setting

00:41:54.690 --> 00:41:58.260
up a program called Bigot
Busters, a very simple catchy name,

00:41:58.260 --> 00:42:00.480
marketing and good branding.

00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:03.950
Send it out there and it was really
to enable teachers in Scotland

00:42:03.950 --> 00:42:08.970
to understand how to pack a
new curriculum [inaudible] have

00:42:08.970 --> 00:42:11.020
citizenship, what that meant.

00:42:11.020 --> 00:42:13.790
And so I'll reach out to
Protestant-based schools,

00:42:13.790 --> 00:42:15.860
nondenominational schools,
like the Protestant schools,

00:42:15.860 --> 00:42:17.600
and Catholic-based schools.

00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:22.420
And the folklore clubs,
Rangers and Celtic.

00:42:22.420 --> 00:42:26.060
As well as educate -- and
work with them in a way

00:42:26.060 --> 00:42:29.580
that would take objects out to
those schools and get projects

00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:32.000
where they would come
as part of a visit.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.260
Every school had to kind
of pay for their visit.

00:42:34.260 --> 00:42:36.420
But if you were a Catholic school
and Protestant school and you came

00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:39.270
in a joint visit, your
trip was free.

00:42:39.270 --> 00:42:41.580
Supported by the local government.

00:42:41.580 --> 00:42:43.640
To encourage that,
foster that healing.

00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:48.110 position:56%
[Inaudible] was a very simple school
space program, but then expanded

00:42:48.110 --> 00:42:51.510
into a way where Ulster
Museum and some

00:42:51.510 --> 00:42:56.800 position:56%
of the Northern Ireland counterparts
would invite me or some colleagues

00:42:56.800 --> 00:42:58.980
to go over to Northern Ireland
but as part of the peace

00:42:58.980 --> 00:43:01.970
and reconciliation
process [inaudible] money.

00:43:01.970 --> 00:43:04.460
They had funding to
support the peace process,

00:43:04.460 --> 00:43:07.940
so we would contact leaders
in the political departments

00:43:07.940 --> 00:43:10.130
in Northern Ireland as a
Northern Ireland assembly

00:43:10.130 --> 00:43:12.230
and community relation
and Ulster Museum

00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:15.960
that would put together groups that
included ex-paramilitary groups.

00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:20.870
IRA, UDA, police officials, army
officers, government officials.

00:43:20.870 --> 00:43:22.170
The Ulster Unionist Party.

00:43:22.170 --> 00:43:25.450
The SDLP. To come as a
part of a group to come

00:43:25.450 --> 00:43:27.590
across the water to Glasgow.

00:43:27.590 --> 00:43:30.970
Because when they do that,
they have something in common.

00:43:30.970 --> 00:43:32.270
Their land.

00:43:32.270 --> 00:43:35.510
You can make that kind of
space for conversation.

00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:39.660
And with that political support,
using our museums as spaces

00:43:39.660 --> 00:43:41.120
to facilitate conversations.

00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:44.480
So that grew from a very simple
program like that to programs

00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:48.060
where we unpacked --
does everyone --

00:43:48.060 --> 00:43:52.840
everyone agree that sectarianism
need to be tackled but when it came

00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:56.060
down to unpacking the divisions
like segregate schools.

00:43:56.060 --> 00:43:58.520
Or a marching culture.

00:43:58.520 --> 00:43:59.820
Then we differed.

00:43:59.820 --> 00:44:03.010
So it was about unpacking those
things that really matter to go

00:44:03.010 --> 00:44:06.960
into a deeper level, and
people sharing their stories.

00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:08.260
One such example.

00:44:08.260 --> 00:44:10.660
And I'm going to tell one
example where as a member of --

00:44:10.660 --> 00:44:13.790
one of those people that came over
was a member of the Orange Order.

00:44:13.790 --> 00:44:16.590
If you know anything about the
Oranges, the Protestant fraternity,

00:44:16.590 --> 00:44:20.650 position:56%
is seen as the 90,000 people walked,
marched through the city of Glasgow

00:44:20.650 --> 00:44:23.370
and it's seen as a
Protestant victory.

00:44:23.370 --> 00:44:27.130
And they're not liked
by many people.

00:44:27.130 --> 00:44:29.870
But one member of the Orange
Order came in that group.

00:44:29.870 --> 00:44:31.360
And we had Roman Catholic members.

00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:34.580
We had people from the
churches and faith.

00:44:34.580 --> 00:44:41.320
And he said to participate in
that one day of dialogue we had

00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:46.680
to [inaudible] that he's doing it
because Jesus is important to him

00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:49.400
and teaches him to
love his neighbor.

00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:51.870
His faith is important to him
but when he goes back home,

00:44:51.870 --> 00:44:54.350
his entire church and community
are going to disown him.

00:44:54.350 --> 00:44:58.760
I think that -- I mean
I think that was brave.

00:44:58.760 --> 00:45:05.340 position:56%
And also because he was able to tell
that in a way that was it authentic.

00:45:05.340 --> 00:45:06.640
It was true.

00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:08.850
It was his personal
experience was about to happen.

00:45:08.850 --> 00:45:12.360
But he did it because of his
brothers and sisters he sees.

00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:15.780
So there was those kind of
more closed-off programs.

00:45:15.780 --> 00:45:19.490 position:56%
There were also things like we
brought in an exhibition that looked

00:45:19.490 --> 00:45:22.570
at 21st images of the
KKK in the United States.

00:45:22.570 --> 00:45:23.870
And we brought that to Scotland.

00:45:23.870 --> 00:45:27.170
One of the reasons being to let
Scotland remember what you sent

00:45:27.170 --> 00:45:32.130
out because it was founded by
you know that Scottish influence.

00:45:32.130 --> 00:45:33.810
Bring it back to Scotland.

00:45:33.810 --> 00:45:37.070
At the same time, in 2005
was the cartoon images

00:45:37.070 --> 00:45:40.410
of the Prophet Mohammed that came
out in the Danish news cartoons.

00:45:40.410 --> 00:45:43.050
I was contacted by a Danish school.

00:45:43.050 --> 00:45:44.670
We said well how, you
know, how are we going --

00:45:44.670 --> 00:45:47.870
and Britain actually banned
those images to be displayed.

00:45:47.870 --> 00:45:51.730
But city leadership said if you
want to do a discussion on this,

00:45:51.730 --> 00:45:53.040
you can use those images.

00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:54.340
You know, we can bring it out,

00:45:54.340 --> 00:45:57.270
even though Tony Blair
banned the use of them.

00:45:57.270 --> 00:46:04.080
So we facilitated a space where
local Muslims and Iraqi Muslims,

00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:06.310
refugee Muslims, could
talk to those students

00:46:06.310 --> 00:46:09.540
and discuss what those
images meant for them

00:46:09.540 --> 00:46:12.180
as Muslims, as Danish young people.

00:46:12.180 --> 00:46:14.560 position:56%
And looked at the exhibition of KKK.

00:46:14.560 --> 00:46:18.600
What can happen when people
use, promote ideas of race,

00:46:18.600 --> 00:46:23.310
racial ideology or
racism through religion.

00:46:23.310 --> 00:46:25.870
There was many levels of that,
and there was obviously much,

00:46:25.870 --> 00:46:28.580
much larger kind of programs
where young kids were empowered

00:46:28.580 --> 00:46:32.510
to write five-point action plans
on how to tackle sectarianism

00:46:32.510 --> 00:46:34.630
between Catholics and
Protestant schools.

00:46:34.630 --> 00:46:37.770
And the kids became the kind of
committee and we would support them

00:46:37.770 --> 00:46:39.740
to write a letter and send
it to the First Minister

00:46:39.740 --> 00:46:42.370
of Scotland demanding a response.

00:46:42.370 --> 00:46:48.130
Many, many [inaudible], but I
think a lot of that process was

00:46:48.130 --> 00:46:52.540
because culture and art
is seen at the forefront

00:46:52.540 --> 00:46:55.220
of each can change our societies.

00:46:55.220 --> 00:46:58.250
One example being in Northern
Ireland, where my colleagues,

00:46:58.250 --> 00:47:02.340
they have in their
collections poetry.

00:47:02.340 --> 00:47:07.330
This big, written by Bobby Sands,
the IRA hunger striker when he was

00:47:07.330 --> 00:47:10.130
in Long Kesh Prison
called Poetic Justice.

00:47:10.130 --> 00:47:13.990 position:56%
It was sneaked out of the museum in
a [inaudible] up someone's backside,

00:47:13.990 --> 00:47:16.240
but eventually got
out of the museum.

00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:18.190
It stayed in the museum's
collections for so many,

00:47:18.190 --> 00:47:23.110
many years until the peace
process was kicked in in Derry.

00:47:23.110 --> 00:47:26.720
And what they could do, they
could then put it on display.

00:47:26.720 --> 00:47:29.220
And then they can invite the
community from both sides to come

00:47:29.220 --> 00:47:30.930
and interpret those objects.

00:47:30.930 --> 00:47:33.270
Not just that one but other --

00:47:33.270 --> 00:47:38.430
there was a steering wheel
that had a bullet through it.

00:47:38.430 --> 00:47:41.750
There were the dust bin, trash
can, that were used as signals.

00:47:41.750 --> 00:47:45.290
In communities, such as Derry, when
the British army were coming in

00:47:45.290 --> 00:47:47.650
and women would clamp
on the trash cans.

00:47:47.650 --> 00:47:49.400
And the men would go through
the underground tunnels

00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:50.770
and escape out to the mountains.

00:47:50.770 --> 00:47:53.460
By bringing in communities

00:47:53.460 --> 00:47:57.930
to interpret these exhibitions
at a time where we can.

00:47:57.930 --> 00:48:00.400
The tensions are still there
but there weren't violence.

00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:02.960
Then that was a good time to
bring those discussions in.

00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:05.350
So these are kind of
examples of many, many others.

00:48:05.350 --> 00:48:10.080
But I think very much -- but
having a very leftist, I guess,

00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:14.530
Glasgow's very -- I think, very
progressive and has a good vision.

00:48:14.530 --> 00:48:18.450
They celebrate every year for the
Douglas' birthday and Mandela Day

00:48:18.450 --> 00:48:20.470
and many, many other components.

00:48:20.470 --> 00:48:22.210
Go to Glasgow, you'll
see what I mean.

00:48:22.210 --> 00:48:24.540
But really taking social issues

00:48:24.540 --> 00:48:26.740
as the starting point
rather than the object.

00:48:26.740 --> 00:48:28.370
A long answer.

00:48:28.370 --> 00:48:29.870
I'm sorry.

00:48:29.870 --> 00:48:31.170
&gt;&gt; It's worth it [inaudible].

00:48:31.170 --> 00:48:32.470
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible].

00:48:32.470 --> 00:48:38.290
Before you went to graduate
school in folklore in Chapel Hill,

00:48:38.290 --> 00:48:43.730
how did academic study in
folklore influence your work?

00:48:43.730 --> 00:48:46.250
&gt;&gt; Kiran Singh Sirah: Do you know,
I have to be really, really honest.

00:48:46.250 --> 00:48:50.630 position:56%
When I, when I was doing work in the
National Museum of Scotland I came

00:48:50.630 --> 00:48:52.720
in as a teacher, as an artist.

00:48:52.720 --> 00:48:56.380
I spent seven -- I would
work seven days a week.

00:48:56.380 --> 00:48:58.670
I would go and work in communities

00:48:58.670 --> 00:49:02.470
and I had a museum's
master background

00:49:02.470 --> 00:49:06.350
and an education background
and an art degree.

00:49:06.350 --> 00:49:08.430
And I've lived in Spain.

00:49:08.430 --> 00:49:12.520
When I came in and then when
I'd done all this work after 10,

00:49:12.520 --> 00:49:16.500
12 years, they said apply for
the Rotary Peace Fellowship.

00:49:16.500 --> 00:49:20.450
And it's by chance that the
Rotary Peace Program was based

00:49:20.450 --> 00:49:22.890
at Duke in UNC.

00:49:22.890 --> 00:49:26.370
But when my person that was
inviting me to come and be part

00:49:26.370 --> 00:49:28.850
of the scholarship-based program,
because we think you should be

00:49:28.850 --> 00:49:30.150
in the folklore department.

00:49:30.150 --> 00:49:31.450
And I said what is folklore?

00:49:31.450 --> 00:49:33.750
And I actually didn't know.

00:49:33.750 --> 00:49:35.050
I couldn't define.

00:49:35.050 --> 00:49:38.540
I always thought that
term, oh it's story tale.

00:49:38.540 --> 00:49:39.840
It's stories.

00:49:39.840 --> 00:49:41.420
You know? And I had that kind of --

00:49:41.420 --> 00:49:43.730
but now looking at
obviously folklore

00:49:43.730 --> 00:49:46.760
from a much more deeper
perspective and looking

00:49:46.760 --> 00:49:50.260 position:56%
at when people say it is [inaudible]
because of the many diverse ways

00:49:50.260 --> 00:49:52.150
that we tell our stories is
telling the world who we are.

00:49:52.150 --> 00:49:53.450
Where we come from.

00:49:53.450 --> 00:49:54.750
Wherever that is your kilt.

00:49:54.750 --> 00:49:56.050
Wherever is your food.

00:49:56.050 --> 00:49:57.350
Your proverb.

00:49:57.350 --> 00:50:01.050
Your -- however we put it out there
is telling the world who we are.

00:50:01.050 --> 00:50:02.350
Where we come from.

00:50:02.350 --> 00:50:05.910
And I would say that a lot
of the -- it didn't as much.

00:50:05.910 --> 00:50:07.240
I did a lot of public reading.

00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:11.130
I read in the daily
newspaper, you know, and I --

00:50:11.130 --> 00:50:16.070
a part [inaudible] maybe
more my museum theory.

00:50:16.070 --> 00:50:18.820
Or museum background
on interpretation

00:50:18.820 --> 00:50:21.960
and those sort of components.

00:50:24.230 --> 00:50:27.040
&gt;&gt; How long are you
going to be here?

00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:28.700
&gt;&gt; Kiran Singh Sirah: I'll be
here till Friday or Saturday.

00:50:28.700 --> 00:50:30.580
&gt;&gt; Great. Then I'd
like to invite you

00:50:30.580 --> 00:50:33.770
to our storytelling
session on Capitol Hill.

00:50:33.770 --> 00:50:35.070
&gt;&gt; Kiran Singh Sirah:
On Capitol Hill?

00:50:35.070 --> 00:50:37.500
&gt;&gt; Tomorrow evening, so I
brought the information.

00:50:37.500 --> 00:50:38.800 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Kiran Singh Sirah: Are you Karen?

00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:40.100
Is your name Karen?

00:50:40.100 --> 00:50:41.400
&gt;&gt; No --

00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:42.700
&gt;&gt; Kiran Singh Sirah: You're Karen.

00:50:42.700 --> 00:50:44.000
Your daughter said I must meet you.

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:45.300
Okay.

00:50:45.300 --> 00:50:47.140
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so we have a
-- it's five years old

00:50:47.140 --> 00:50:49.600
where every month we tell stories.

00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:52.090
We have seen and people
get together.

00:50:52.090 --> 00:50:53.390
&gt;&gt; Kiran Singh Sirah:
And that's invited

00:50:53.390 --> 00:50:54.980
by open invitation to people.

00:50:54.980 --> 00:50:57.440
&gt;&gt; Oh yeah, [inaudible]
at the center,

00:50:57.440 --> 00:51:00.570
at our community center
on Capitol Hill.

00:51:00.570 --> 00:51:02.140
At the corner store.

00:51:02.140 --> 00:51:04.240
And on Saturday morning,

00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:09.330
the children have their
storytelling happy hour

00:51:09.330 --> 00:51:11.530
because we try to encourage.

00:51:11.530 --> 00:51:16.190
I'm the liaison for Washington
from National Storytelling Network.

00:51:16.190 --> 00:51:17.490
&gt;&gt; Kiran Singh Sirah: Okay.

00:51:17.490 --> 00:51:18.790
Perfect.

00:51:18.790 --> 00:51:20.090
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:51:20.090 --> 00:51:21.390
&gt;&gt; Kiran Singh Sirah:
Excellent [inaudible].

00:51:21.390 --> 00:51:22.690
That's very good.

00:51:22.690 --> 00:51:23.990
That'll be great.

00:51:23.990 --> 00:51:25.290
Last time I was in Capitol
Hill I was doing poetry

00:51:25.290 --> 00:51:26.590
for an anti-fracking demonstration.

00:51:26.590 --> 00:51:29.230
So it's a great place
-- great platform.

00:51:29.230 --> 00:51:32.140
So tomorrow at in the evening.

00:51:32.140 --> 00:51:34.530
Okay. Perfect.

00:51:34.530 --> 00:51:35.830
Thank you so much.

00:51:35.830 --> 00:51:39.910
&gt;&gt; And for the rest of us,
what time does it start?

00:51:39.910 --> 00:51:43.560
&gt;&gt; At seven to eight and you
have wine and cheese [inaudible].

00:51:43.560 --> 00:51:46.510
&gt;&gt; Kiran Singh Sirah:
I like wine and cheese.

00:51:46.510 --> 00:51:49.270
[ Laughter ]

00:51:49.270 --> 00:51:50.570
&gt;&gt; Okay. Thank you.

00:51:50.570 --> 00:51:52.580
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:51:52.580 --> 00:51:58.610 position:56%
&gt;&gt; I wanted you to talk a little bit
about your experiences [inaudible].

00:51:58.610 --> 00:52:03.130
How are you with your
vision and ideas

00:52:03.130 --> 00:52:07.290
about storytelling how
Jonesborough is not all

00:52:07.290 --> 00:52:10.590
that [inaudible], I
don't think probable.

00:52:10.590 --> 00:52:13.010
&gt;&gt; Kiran Singh Sirah: Well,
I think it's -- I mean.

00:52:13.010 --> 00:52:17.520 position:56%
I don't want to get into US politics
[inaudible] but I mean I'm --

00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:19.030
I'm a brown dude from Europe.

00:52:19.030 --> 00:52:21.780
I'm obviously -- you know I've come

00:52:21.780 --> 00:52:27.290
from a different mental-political
[inaudible],

00:52:27.290 --> 00:52:29.580
but I think it is progressive.

00:52:29.580 --> 00:52:32.930
In the sense that there are
people there, there's a belief

00:52:32.930 --> 00:52:34.360
that the arts are important.

00:52:34.360 --> 00:52:36.140
They've invested in
the arts as a catalyst.

00:52:36.140 --> 00:52:39.030
We talk about as cultural
trend, creative place-making.

00:52:39.030 --> 00:52:42.320
What [inaudible] been doing for 44
years because arts is a catalyst

00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:45.790
that is grown the community,
provides jobs,

00:52:45.790 --> 00:52:50.280
supports an economic impact of
$7.6 million for the local region.

00:52:50.280 --> 00:52:53.370
That's a pretty good creative
place-making case study.

00:52:53.370 --> 00:52:54.730
All right?

00:52:54.730 --> 00:52:57.880
I think it's progressive also
because this history of progression

00:52:57.880 --> 00:53:00.160
because [inaudible] at
the birthplace right next

00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:04.070
to our building is the
birthplace of the emancipator,

00:53:04.070 --> 00:53:06.980
America's first abolitionist
newspaper.

00:53:06.980 --> 00:53:11.190
Which I knew about in my work
back in Scotland, and here it is.

00:53:11.190 --> 00:53:14.700
There's a history of various
different types of progressions.

00:53:14.700 --> 00:53:19.610
You know obviously the way
[inaudible] politics are seen today

00:53:19.610 --> 00:53:21.780
is various ways of looking at it.

00:53:21.780 --> 00:53:23.700
But there's a very strong
connection to values

00:53:23.700 --> 00:53:25.160
and community and connection.

00:53:25.160 --> 00:53:26.460
And I think that's very important,

00:53:26.460 --> 00:53:28.550
and I think there's a
very good welcome of that.

00:53:28.550 --> 00:53:30.190
My work in the storytelling center.

00:53:30.190 --> 00:53:33.680
When I first started, I
think there was a reach

00:53:33.680 --> 00:53:36.380
out to the National Storytelling
Network that were invited

00:53:36.380 --> 00:53:39.720
to ask what type of person
would you like to see.

00:53:39.720 --> 00:53:42.230
Now Jimmy Neil Smith, my
predecessor and my friend,

00:53:42.230 --> 00:53:50.890
had founded the organization for
and retired in 2010 for 40 years.

00:53:50.890 --> 00:53:55.260
And they said they want
someone to put the international

00:53:55.260 --> 00:53:57.150
into the International
Storytelling Center.

00:53:57.150 --> 00:53:58.450
They want someone younger.

00:53:58.450 --> 00:54:00.430
They want a folklorist.

00:54:00.430 --> 00:54:01.920
Well they got that.

00:54:01.920 --> 00:54:05.230
You know, they got a
slam poet, too, you know.

00:54:05.230 --> 00:54:08.990
And so where I see it is I'm not
a US citizen, so the way I think

00:54:08.990 --> 00:54:12.910
about -- we have an
international responsibility.

00:54:12.910 --> 00:54:16.030
[Inaudible] every US
organization for my time,

00:54:16.030 --> 00:54:20.170
but I do that so we can do pro-bono
work in Rwanda, in South Africa.

00:54:20.170 --> 00:54:21.470
In the Middle East.

00:54:21.470 --> 00:54:23.450
Because that's part of our
international responsibility.

00:54:23.450 --> 00:54:26.790
We have to share our resources.

00:54:26.790 --> 00:54:29.140
The sort of the work that
we try and do is to build,

00:54:29.140 --> 00:54:31.120
before the storytelling
center, I didn't know about it.

00:54:31.120 --> 00:54:33.770
So we have to build a type
of strategic partnership,

00:54:33.770 --> 00:54:35.430
so people can be engaged.

00:54:35.430 --> 00:54:38.490
And I think that's ultimately is
about when we can harness the power

00:54:38.490 --> 00:54:42.960
of story for a young person
to cultivate how to use story

00:54:42.960 --> 00:54:44.440
in various different ways.

00:54:44.440 --> 00:54:48.330
So building partnerships with
like the Google Cultural Institute

00:54:48.330 --> 00:54:50.330
so we can create video
footage that goes

00:54:50.330 --> 00:54:53.380
out to 14 million social
media followers.

00:54:53.380 --> 00:54:56.640
To reestablish work
with UN education.

00:54:56.640 --> 00:54:59.880
Put peace at the heart
of what we're doing.

00:54:59.880 --> 00:55:02.830
Put community building at the
heart of what we're doing.

00:55:02.830 --> 00:55:04.730
And form the right
type of partnerships.

00:55:04.730 --> 00:55:08.200
The right type of partnerships
are when we're invited to go

00:55:08.200 --> 00:55:11.410
to Charleston, South Carolina,
to work with the victims

00:55:11.410 --> 00:55:14.820
and families following the massacre
that took place in Charleston.

00:55:14.820 --> 00:55:17.300
The right types of partnerships
is the Ferguson commission,

00:55:17.300 --> 00:55:20.800
using stories to help promote
healing and reconciliation.

00:55:20.800 --> 00:55:24.360
Working in Baltimore.

00:55:24.360 --> 00:55:26.460
Working with communities
on the grassroots level.

00:55:26.460 --> 00:55:30.080
Our trying to use story to honor
their ancestors, native cultures,

00:55:30.080 --> 00:55:32.070
African-American ancestry.

00:55:32.070 --> 00:55:35.980
To help bring more balance
to America's story by working

00:55:35.980 --> 00:55:39.840
with partnerships that can help
America to understand itself

00:55:39.840 --> 00:55:42.970
from the diverse ways that
we can see one another.

00:55:42.970 --> 00:55:44.640
Those are very strategic.

00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:48.150
It's also about looking beyond
the art sector and working

00:55:48.150 --> 00:55:49.760
with the international
development sector.

00:55:49.760 --> 00:55:52.810 position:56%
I work a lot with the peacebuilding,
Alliance of Peacebuilding,

00:55:52.810 --> 00:55:56.490
and the way -- because we want to
put storytelling as both a folk

00:55:56.490 --> 00:56:00.110
and traditional art form
and the many different ways.

00:56:00.110 --> 00:56:02.780
But put it at the heart
of peacebuilding work.

00:56:02.780 --> 00:56:06.180
So we're doing programs here
in DC and with the Alliance

00:56:06.180 --> 00:56:12.010 position:56%
for Peacebuilding this week, looking
at story as a counterterrorism tool.

00:56:12.010 --> 00:56:16.850
And building global strategies
with civil society organization

00:56:16.850 --> 00:56:19.800
to empower and use [inaudible] as
a creative tool at the beginning

00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:24.110
of conflict prevention and not
part of conflict resolution.

00:56:24.110 --> 00:56:28.710
[Inaudible] arts and creativity
and culture and at the forefront

00:56:28.710 --> 00:56:31.990
of our thinking when we're building
strategic partnerships [inaudible]

00:56:31.990 --> 00:56:34.180
across the world, so
we can be smarter.

00:56:34.180 --> 00:56:37.520
We can draw from our
traditions to alleviate conflict

00:56:37.520 --> 00:56:40.260 position:56%
and prevent conflict from happening.

00:56:40.260 --> 00:56:42.420
So we're doing a lot
of that type of work.

00:56:42.420 --> 00:56:44.200
And obviously reaching
out in Silicon Valley

00:56:44.200 --> 00:56:47.810
for those investors [inaudible]
I'm reaching out to Silicon Valley.

00:56:47.810 --> 00:56:49.540 position:56%
I'm reaching out to Ford Foundation.

00:56:49.540 --> 00:56:52.750 position:56%
And inviting people with lots of
money to come and support what we do

00:56:52.750 --> 00:56:56.160
because you can't do
what we do without money.

00:56:56.160 --> 00:56:57.580
So that's partly that.

00:56:57.580 --> 00:57:01.290
But you have to look at -- and you
know corporate investments as well.

00:57:01.290 --> 00:57:03.440
So there's a lot of that and
growing the festival in a way

00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:06.820
to make it meaningful for
diverse ways of looking

00:57:06.820 --> 00:57:08.170
at ways stories can connect.

00:57:08.170 --> 00:57:10.190
So we invite slam poets.

00:57:10.190 --> 00:57:11.530
We invite the founders of slam.

00:57:11.530 --> 00:57:15.050
We invited Piper Kerman to
offer Orange is the New Black.

00:57:15.050 --> 00:57:18.880
Many older people won't know
her, but many millennials do

00:57:18.880 --> 00:57:21.760
because she's a hit, around
50 million viewers on Netflix.

00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:24.430 position:56%
So you invite her to come and tell
her personal story about what it was

00:57:24.430 --> 00:57:27.100
like to be incarcerated for a year.

00:57:27.100 --> 00:57:31.070
Through an LGBT [inaudible]-based
stories, 9/11-based stories.

00:57:31.070 --> 00:57:33.760
And invite and making sure
that diversity and equality is

00:57:33.760 --> 00:57:37.890
at the forefront on the front
stages and never on the fringes.

00:57:37.890 --> 00:57:41.610
Diversity, equality, is at
the heart, at the forefront

00:57:41.610 --> 00:57:44.970
and very visually out there
because it sends a signal

00:57:44.970 --> 00:57:46.870
that if you're a National
Storytelling Festival you have

00:57:46.870 --> 00:57:50.080
to represent the nation, you know.

00:57:50.080 --> 00:57:52.020 position:56%
And not just the Appalachian region.

00:57:52.020 --> 00:57:53.320
A lot of those type of work.

00:57:53.320 --> 00:57:55.310
&gt;&gt; Hi Kiran --

00:57:55.310 --> 00:57:57.110
&gt;&gt; Kiran Singh Sirah: Hey Todd --

00:57:57.110 --> 00:58:01.140
[ Inaudible Response ]

00:58:01.140 --> 00:58:02.440
&gt;&gt; And the National
Storytelling Center,

00:58:02.440 --> 00:58:04.690 position:56%
we've been partners for a long time.

00:58:04.690 --> 00:58:10.670
And I think that you're one of our
major partners and I just wondered

00:58:10.670 --> 00:58:13.920
if in your kind of idealistic
world, what would the --

00:58:13.920 --> 00:58:15.220
how would that partnership look?

00:58:15.220 --> 00:58:18.140
How would we help to
reflect the vision

00:58:18.140 --> 00:58:20.980
that you're bringing to the center?

00:58:20.980 --> 00:58:23.130
&gt;&gt; Kiran Singh Sirah:
Thanks Todd [laughter].

00:58:23.130 --> 00:58:27.870
I mean I see it as a -- you
know, it's a great relationship.

00:58:27.870 --> 00:58:31.350
And it's kind of like we're growing
together, and we're growing in line

00:58:31.350 --> 00:58:34.760
with the way the storytelling
movements growing, too.

00:58:34.760 --> 00:58:38.260
I see it as a way that I'd love
to be able to find the grant

00:58:38.260 --> 00:58:40.760
to digitize the entire collection.

00:58:40.760 --> 00:58:42.420
When we digitize that
entire collection.

00:58:42.420 --> 00:58:44.860
The way I see it is that
we can help tell the story

00:58:44.860 --> 00:58:46.620
of the storytelling movement.

00:58:46.620 --> 00:58:49.270
Because if you've got all these
collections from Ray Hicks

00:58:49.270 --> 00:58:51.360
and Kathryn Windrom [assumed
spelling] and Jackie Torrance

00:58:51.360 --> 00:58:54.580
and you know going
back to Guy Carawan

00:58:54.580 --> 00:58:56.870
and Doc McConnell, [inaudible].

00:58:56.870 --> 00:58:58.350
Pete Seeger.

00:58:58.350 --> 00:58:59.710
They're in your collections.

00:58:59.710 --> 00:59:01.950
Once we digitize that
collections we can create ways

00:59:01.950 --> 00:59:03.610
to make public access.

00:59:03.610 --> 00:59:06.010
Every kid in America
can get connected

00:59:06.010 --> 00:59:08.250
to the diverse [inaudible] the
way the storytelling movement has

00:59:08.250 --> 00:59:14.010
changed, from [inaudible]
personal narrative now.

00:59:14.010 --> 00:59:18.290
You could enter [inaudible]
and all these great programs,

00:59:18.290 --> 00:59:20.050
then we can create public programs.

00:59:20.050 --> 00:59:23.490
And that's my interest is to
really digitize those collections,

00:59:23.490 --> 00:59:27.930
but I also want to look at the
way these collections can be used

00:59:27.930 --> 00:59:31.660
in ways to promote things like how
do we grapple with climate change?

00:59:31.660 --> 00:59:34.130
Because I think in a lot of
those stories that we have,

00:59:34.130 --> 00:59:37.730
because they have so many
of the folktales that draw

00:59:37.730 --> 00:59:43.190
from many different traditions
and draw from diaspora traditions.

00:59:43.190 --> 00:59:46.670
That a lot of these have content
and wisdom that we can apply

00:59:46.670 --> 00:59:49.310
to when we're trying to grapple
with migration and issues

00:59:49.310 --> 00:59:51.680
and climate change and
conflict and war and a lot

00:59:51.680 --> 00:59:54.370
of the international
peacekeeping world.

00:59:54.370 --> 00:59:58.550
Peace and [inaudible] to
connect with this ancient wisdom.

00:59:58.550 --> 01:00:00.630
Because they are the
[inaudible] of our world.

01:00:00.630 --> 01:00:03.820
So I'd love to see that more
-- that type of collaboration.

01:00:03.820 --> 01:00:07.080
Obviously the commitment to
public access is really important.

01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:10.460
And if this Google
partnership happens --

01:00:10.460 --> 01:00:11.760
I don't know if Nicky's here.

01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:13.400
But this Google partner
-- hello Nicky.

01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:15.540
So with the Google
partnership, if that happens,

01:00:15.540 --> 01:00:16.840
then obviously we can help

01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:18.770
to digitize part of
the print collection.

01:00:18.770 --> 01:00:20.270
Which that's a great start

01:00:20.270 --> 01:00:22.880
because we can eventually make
this material more [inaudible].

01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:28.430
And obviously I think you know
drawing from the expertise

01:00:28.430 --> 01:00:33.710
of what you guys have and
allowing more people to get access,

01:00:33.710 --> 01:00:35.760
not just here but also
across the world,

01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:38.910
so people can see the
story behind the story.

01:00:38.910 --> 01:00:41.230
What makes up America.

01:00:41.230 --> 01:00:42.530
Thank you very much.

01:00:42.530 --> 01:00:46.820
Yeah. Up to you, Nancy.

01:00:46.820 --> 01:00:49.060
&gt;&gt; I'd like to take one
or two more questions.

01:00:49.060 --> 01:00:50.360
&gt;&gt; Kiran Singh Sirah: Sure.

01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:51.660
I'll take one [inaudible].

01:00:51.660 --> 01:00:56.190
&gt;&gt; I'm kind of an amateur
learning about storytelling.

01:00:56.190 --> 01:01:03.030
But I was just wondering
if you have any suggestions

01:01:03.030 --> 01:01:11.840
of what the average person can
do in their day-to-day life

01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:17.440
to promote connection and
engagement and what they can do

01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:19.420
with their personal story.

01:01:19.420 --> 01:01:21.010
In a simple way.

01:01:21.010 --> 01:01:22.310
&gt;&gt; Kiran Singh Sirah: Absolutely.

01:01:22.310 --> 01:01:23.610
I think that's a good question.

01:01:23.610 --> 01:01:25.120
I think it's really important.

01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:29.820
I think sometimes when I
do storytelling workshops,

01:01:29.820 --> 01:01:35.330
sometimes I don't start off
the question what's your story

01:01:35.330 --> 01:01:39.410
because suddenly you just
get this kind of blank.

01:01:39.410 --> 01:01:45.170
And you feel like you
have to be really good.

01:01:45.170 --> 01:01:48.840
So you start off with a question.

01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:53.290
What's the moment that
you start to think

01:01:53.290 --> 01:01:55.560
about the world in a different way?

01:01:55.560 --> 01:01:59.410
What was the happiest
part of your life?

01:01:59.410 --> 01:02:03.840
When you go back home at
Thanksgiving or you're

01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:08.490
with your loved one, you don't
-- you become the storyteller.

01:02:08.490 --> 01:02:14.460
And so going back to the moments
that are important to you.

01:02:14.460 --> 01:02:20.130
And I always do a little
meditation, actually.

01:02:20.130 --> 01:02:21.430
Close your eyes.

01:02:21.430 --> 01:02:25.670
In your mind go back to when you
were young and paint a picture

01:02:25.670 --> 01:02:32.260 position:56%
of what it looks like in standing in
front of your house, of your home.

01:02:32.260 --> 01:02:36.520
Start describing the sky and if it
was words or [inaudible] taste it.

01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:40.270
Start going back into
your imagination

01:02:40.270 --> 01:02:41.570
because all the content is there.

01:02:41.570 --> 01:02:44.770
And [inaudible] sometimes just
start with those single moments.

01:02:44.770 --> 01:02:46.070
The moment that you --

01:02:46.070 --> 01:02:52.180 position:56%
that's important to you that
changed the way that you might think

01:02:52.180 --> 01:02:54.040
about a certain thing in life.

01:02:54.040 --> 01:02:55.340
Or experience.

01:02:55.340 --> 01:02:57.470
Or a person you met.

01:02:57.470 --> 01:02:58.770
Or an event.

01:02:58.770 --> 01:03:04.010 position:56%
And use that as a starting place and
then you start, just start exploring

01:03:04.010 --> 01:03:09.660
that and use that as a starting
place to start writing your story.

01:03:09.660 --> 01:03:17.580
And don't worry about it being all
[inaudible] amazingly presented.

01:03:17.580 --> 01:03:25.330
You know beginning, middle,
and end type of ideas.

01:03:25.330 --> 01:03:27.810
Just start and see
where it takes you.

01:03:27.810 --> 01:03:32.040
Other than that, there's
a toolkit you can use.

01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:40.830
And I got a toolkit called Telling
Stories that Matter on our website,

01:03:40.830 --> 01:03:43.860
International Storytelling Center.

01:03:43.860 --> 01:03:47.760
That looks at not just
how you tell your own --

01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:53.430
how you can cultivate your own
story but how you can use it

01:03:53.430 --> 01:03:56.310
in community-building work.

01:03:56.310 --> 01:03:59.070
How you can collect story
with some ethics in them.

01:03:59.070 --> 01:04:03.450
About the importance of when you're
collecting stories you know some

01:04:03.450 --> 01:04:07.440
of those ethical rules I
think you should be following.

01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:09.710
I hope that was helpful.

01:04:09.710 --> 01:04:11.550
I've got two -- sorry.

01:04:11.550 --> 01:04:12.850
Bill and -- yeah.

01:04:12.850 --> 01:04:15.870
&gt;&gt; Well I'll give you a
chance to tell a story here.

01:04:15.870 --> 01:04:17.170
&gt;&gt; Kiran Singh Sirah: Oh no.

01:04:17.170 --> 01:04:18.470
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible].

01:04:18.470 --> 01:04:22.050
Earlier on you mentioned bringing
two gangs together in Glasgow

01:04:22.050 --> 01:04:27.920
and the first bringing them
together resulted in a fight.

01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:32.930
And you tried it again, and
a fight didn't take place.

01:04:32.930 --> 01:04:43.040 position:56%
So what did you do to keep the fight
from breaking out in the first time

01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:47.130
and what did you hope to achieve?

01:04:47.130 --> 01:04:48.430
&gt;&gt; Kiran Singh Sirah:
Well [inaudible].

01:04:48.430 --> 01:04:52.230
Yeah. I mean the idea is
because what happened.

01:04:52.230 --> 01:04:59.090
And Glasgow's very territorial,
and it's pocketed with Catholics

01:04:59.090 --> 01:05:02.920
and Protestants, Catholics
and Protestants.

01:05:02.920 --> 01:05:04.950 position:56%
But [inaudible] and the reason we --

01:05:04.950 --> 01:05:08.400
the reason we wanted to do
that together is because a lot

01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:13.490
of these young groups are
age 12 and 13 years old.

01:05:13.490 --> 01:05:16.000
They would die for their friends.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:21.550
That family unit that they create
in those groups, territorial.

01:05:21.550 --> 01:05:25.860
You could be GYT, Govannhill
Young Team, and you'd mark your --

01:05:25.860 --> 01:05:29.860
but you won't go across the street
because that's a [inaudible].

01:05:29.860 --> 01:05:32.980
But inside those groups,
you've got Ranger's supporters

01:05:32.980 --> 01:05:38.100
and Celtic support, the
Catholics and Protestants.

01:05:38.100 --> 01:05:39.400
So it's kind of like the time

01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:40.970
where we can unpack
what sectarianism means

01:05:40.970 --> 01:05:44.880
in the city before they become --
they start going to football games

01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:47.290
with the dad and to different pubs.

01:05:47.290 --> 01:05:50.690
So the idea was to unpack that
friendship and unpack when you hear

01:05:50.690 --> 01:05:52.790
that -- using those -- what
does that mean for them?

01:05:52.790 --> 01:05:56.570
So the reason why it kicked off
as a fight in the first time was

01:05:56.570 --> 01:05:58.100 position:56%
because we didn't have enough of us.

01:05:58.100 --> 01:06:01.410
We didn't have enough of
the social work staff.

01:06:01.410 --> 01:06:03.220 position:56%
There was too many in the group, and
that something happened between one

01:06:03.220 --> 01:06:04.840
of those young people that it --
there was a lot of tension inside

01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:06.160
that young man, that it
was already in a conflict.

01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:07.780
The next time we do it, I sought
the advice from social workers.

01:06:07.780 --> 01:06:09.080
They're the specialists when
it comes to those young --

01:06:09.080 --> 01:06:10.380
they understood their lives.

01:06:10.380 --> 01:06:11.680
They could describe what was
going on and what was going on.

01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:12.980
We reduced the number of the group
and we increased some social work

01:06:12.980 --> 01:06:14.280
and we just planned it better.

01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:15.580
And we did it again.

01:06:15.580 --> 01:06:16.880
One of the things that we did is
the Restorative Justice Program,

01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:18.180 position:56%
was a program where if a young
person commits a first-time offense.

01:06:18.180 --> 01:06:19.480
Usually what they do, I asked
the police officer what do you do

01:06:19.480 --> 01:06:20.780
[inaudible] get them to paint
the train station or whatever.

01:06:20.780 --> 01:06:22.080
Just a community service.

01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:23.380
I said well send them to me.

01:06:23.380 --> 01:06:24.680
So they started coming to
me in the museum and working

01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:25.980
on three months' residencies
with artists.

01:06:25.980 --> 01:06:27.280
I got artists, textile artists,
poets, and all sorts of people.

01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:28.580
And they thought they're
being punished,

01:06:28.580 --> 01:06:29.880
but what they're doing is
creating an exhibition.

01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:31.180
And some of these exhibitions
would have GYT, the vernacular form

01:06:31.180 --> 01:06:32.480
of graffiti you find in Glasgow

01:06:32.480 --> 01:06:33.780
and turn it anti-sectarian
or anti-racism.

01:06:33.780 --> 01:06:35.080
Messages. And we've displayed

01:06:35.080 --> 01:06:36.380
that alongside Salvador Dali's
Christ of St John of the Cross.

01:06:36.380 --> 01:06:37.680
The most famous painting
in Scotland.

01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:38.980
When a young person sees their
artwork displayed alongside this

01:06:38.980 --> 01:06:40.280
most important painting, they --

01:06:40.280 --> 01:06:41.580
well, it's basically
saying society loves you.

01:06:41.580 --> 01:06:42.880
Society cares about you
and your voice matters.

01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:44.180 position:56%
When you start to cultivate your own
story, you start to love yourself.

01:06:44.180 --> 01:06:45.480
And when you love yourself,
you can love others.

01:06:45.480 --> 01:06:46.780
So those were types of programs
that we did, but it was very much

01:06:46.780 --> 01:06:48.080
about one-to-one small group
work for a lot of that.

01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:49.380
It was very intense.

01:06:49.380 --> 01:06:50.680
But bringing in other specialists.

01:06:50.680 --> 01:06:51.980
You were specialists in one area

01:06:51.980 --> 01:06:53.280
but others recognize other
people have specialisms

01:06:53.280 --> 01:06:54.580
and join from the specialism.

01:06:54.580 --> 01:06:55.880
I'm sorry [inaudible].

01:06:55.880 --> 01:06:57.180
Well yeah.

01:06:57.180 --> 01:06:58.480
Last one and then yeah.

01:06:58.480 --> 01:06:59.780
Just -- yes?

01:07:01.310 --> 01:07:02.610
&gt;&gt; Kiran Singh Sirah: My kilt?

01:07:02.610 --> 01:07:05.410
&gt;&gt; Yeah [laughter].

01:07:05.410 --> 01:07:07.210
&gt;&gt; Kiran Singh Sirah: Thank you.

01:07:07.210 --> 01:07:17.980
[ Inaudible Response ]

01:07:17.980 --> 01:07:23.540
&gt;&gt; And I heard you talking about
Africans, people of African descent

01:07:23.540 --> 01:07:29.660
from all over diaspora but I didn't
hear very much about Africans --

01:07:29.660 --> 01:07:33.520
diasporic Africans here, from here.

01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:36.250
You know? Those who had come --

01:07:36.250 --> 01:07:39.230
whose people had come through
the enslaved experience.

01:07:39.230 --> 01:07:44.420 position:56%
And I just wondered is the African
Voices Exhibit included those voices

01:07:44.420 --> 01:07:45.720
as well?

01:07:45.720 --> 01:07:50.090
Because often we are
considered not diasporic.

01:07:50.090 --> 01:07:51.390
&gt;&gt; Kiran Singh Sirah: No.

01:07:51.390 --> 01:07:52.690
Yeah.

01:07:52.690 --> 01:07:53.990
&gt;&gt; I don't know where they
think we came from but --

01:07:53.990 --> 01:07:55.290
&gt;&gt; Kiran Singh Sirah: Yeah.

01:07:55.290 --> 01:07:57.980
It did in the sense -- but maybe
because such a large portion

01:07:57.980 --> 01:08:01.000
of the black population
in Britain is Caribbean.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.750
So Guyana and Jamaica and
all the Caribbean islands.

01:08:03.750 --> 01:08:07.580
So a very large population
in Scotland, across Scotland,

01:08:07.580 --> 01:08:10.600
is the Caribbean, African-Caribbean
population.

01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:14.380
So we did Beth Ford who
was African-Caribbean.

01:08:14.380 --> 01:08:18.940
But during that time, there was
many, many projects that we did.

01:08:18.940 --> 01:08:20.780
And we looked at transatlantic
slavery.

01:08:20.780 --> 01:08:22.500
We looked at the products
that came into Glasgow.

01:08:22.500 --> 01:08:25.220
We looked at the tobacco lords
because most of tobacco that came

01:08:25.220 --> 01:08:28.660
from this part of the world,
in Americas, came to Glasgow.

01:08:28.660 --> 01:08:32.360
Glasgow made its fortune
distributed across Europe

01:08:32.360 --> 01:08:33.670
with other products you know coming

01:08:33.670 --> 01:08:36.280
into Liverpool, [inaudible]
or Bristol.

01:08:36.280 --> 01:08:39.870
But part of that was also
looking up say Robert Burns.

01:08:39.870 --> 01:08:43.860
When Robert Burns was asked
to be a plantation owner

01:08:43.860 --> 01:08:47.210
and came [inaudible] refused
and wrote the Slave's Lament.

01:08:47.210 --> 01:08:50.790
So we looked at Scottish heroes but
looked at it from that perspective.

01:08:50.790 --> 01:08:54.600
So invited people and artists
to interpret that stuff

01:08:54.600 --> 01:08:57.070
on various different perspectives.

01:08:57.070 --> 01:08:58.370
But we did look at the life

01:08:58.370 --> 01:09:01.640
of you know leading abolitionists
like Frederick Douglass.

01:09:01.640 --> 01:09:04.760
You know, there was some loose
connections with Boston and things

01:09:04.760 --> 01:09:08.450
like that, but it was primarily
looking at within Britain

01:09:08.450 --> 01:09:10.300
and those British colonies.

01:09:10.300 --> 01:09:11.600
But I agree.

01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:14.310
I don't think there
was probably as much

01:09:14.310 --> 01:09:18.210
as [inaudible] the
United States [inaudible].

01:09:18.210 --> 01:09:19.510
Yeah. Next time.

01:09:19.510 --> 01:09:20.810
Thank you.

01:09:20.810 --> 01:09:22.110
Yeah.

01:09:22.110 --> 01:09:23.410
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much.

01:09:23.410 --> 01:09:24.710

Thank you.
