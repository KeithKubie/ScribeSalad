[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.250
SPEAKER 1: I'm excited
to introduce our guests

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.770
and share a little bit more
about the National Asian

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:12.630
American Survey.

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.079
So the National Asian
American Survey, or NAAS,

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:18.090
is a scientific and
nonpartisan effort

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.220
to poll the opinions
of Asian Americans

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.490
and Pacific Islanders on
issues such as public policy,

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.140
political preferences,
experiences

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.630
with discrimination,
and race relations.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.790
And here with us
today we have two

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:32.490
of the principal
investigators and researchers

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:37.560
from the NAAS, Jennifer Lee
and Karthick Ramakrishnan.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.620
Jennifer Lee is a
professor of sociology

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.390
at Columbia University.

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.210
She has written award-winning
articles and books, including

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.240
"The Asian American Achievement
Paradox," "The Diversity

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.760
Paradox," "Asian American
Youth," and "Civility

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.050
in the City."

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.850
Committed to public
engagement, she

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.290
has written for
and been featured

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.960
in a variety of media outlets,
including "The New York

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.580
Times," "The San Francisco
Chronicle," CNN, and NPR.

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.489
And then Karthick Ramakrishnan
is an associate dean

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.640
of the UC Riverside
School of Public Policy

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.790
and professor of public
policy and political science.

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.250
And he directs the National
Asian American Survey

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.160
and is the founder
of AAPIData.com,

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.620
which features demographic
data and policy

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.410
research on Asian Americans
and Pacific Islanders.

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:24.060
He's also written
dozens of op-eds

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.310
and appeared in over
1,000 news stories

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.590
in many, many major
outlets, including "The New

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.360
York Times," "The Economist,"
"Los Angeles Times," and CNN.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.450
So please welcome Jennifer
and Karthick to the stage.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.382
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:39.837 --> 00:01:41.420
KARTHICK RAMAKRISHNAN:
Thank you, Amy,

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.420
and thank you everyone
for being here,

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.560
both in person and remotely.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.230
There's a lot of ground that
we're going to cover today.

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:54.290
We'll have plenty of time
for question and answers.

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.370
I'll be presenting primarily
on AAPI Data, which

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:02.720
as Amy mentioned, is a site that
seeks to make data and policy

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.150
research on Asian Americans
and Pacific Islanders more

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:06.560
accessible.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.127
What we found in
the last four years

00:02:08.127 --> 00:02:09.710
is that we've had
tremendous influence

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:13.220
in terms of raising the
media profile and awareness

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.620
among journalists
of not only, kind

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.840
of, general facts about
Asian Americans and Pacific

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.150
Islanders, but also
some of the complexity

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.790
that we'll go over today.

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.650
Jennifer will
primarily be presenting

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.710
from our latest National
Asian American survey,

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:32.100
and then I'll conclude with
some final data points.

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.150
So, first of all,
just in the future,

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.340
if you're interested
in finding out more,

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.200
please take a look
at our website.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.610
We have a lot there.

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:41.630
We have infographics.

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.480
We do a fair amount of work
through our infographics.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.050
We also have a feature called
Quick Stats which gives people

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:52.820
access to data at various levels
of geography on frequently

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.617
requested tables from
the Census Bureau.

00:02:55.617 --> 00:02:57.200
Given all the talent
in the room here,

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.940
I'd love to talk
later about maybe ways

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.170
that we can improve some
of our Quick Stats features

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.940
with the talent among
folks at Google.

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.000
The main takeaways of
my portion of the talk

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.797
is, first of all, to talk about
the growing importance of Asian

00:03:12.797 --> 00:03:15.820
Americans, but to show that
that growth in and of itself

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.970
is limited, because there
is a big gap between what

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.890
our numbers look
like and where we

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.050
stand in terms of leadership
and civic engagement.

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:27.445
And I'll submit to you that
the problems of leadership

00:03:27.445 --> 00:03:29.560
and mobility within
the corporate structure

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.530
is related to our
lack of visibility

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.420
when it comes to
civic engagement.

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.671
And the solutions
are linked as well.

00:03:36.671 --> 00:03:38.920
So first of all, in terms
of talking about the growing

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.070
importance of Asian
Americans, some of you

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:46.240
may be familiar with some
of these statistics already.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.740
First is population growth.

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.890
Whenever someone talks about
why we need to pay attention

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:53.050
to Asian Americans
and Pacific Islanders,

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:56.360
we are among the fastest growing
racial groups in the country.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:01.030
This was true from 2000 to 2010,
and it's been true since 2010

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:02.180
as well.

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.350
And much of this growth
is fueled by immigration.

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:09.730
So what we've seen since
2004, so over a decade, almost

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:11.590
a decade and a half
now, there have

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.810
been more Asians
that are coming in

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:15.820
as legal permanent
residents than Latinos

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:19.200
coming in as legal
permanent residents.

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.089
Starting in 2007,
a decade ago, there

00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:23.640
have been more Asian foreign
born coming into the United

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.500
States than from any
other region in the world,

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:31.140
including Mexico
and Central America.

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:34.020
We've also seen a rapid increase
in the Asian undocumented

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.400
population.

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.760
One of the things you may have
seen, this little factoid,

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.160
that one out of every
seven Asian immigrants

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.870
is undocumented.

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:44.640
That's something
that we had done

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.836
a lot of information work--

00:04:46.836 --> 00:04:48.210
we produced
infographics and I've

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.940
done a lot of social
media engagement on that.

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.700
So much so that that
talking point is now

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:55.770
entering into the
discourse in Congress

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:59.495
among leaders in the
Congressional APA Caucus.

00:04:59.495 --> 00:05:01.620
And then finally, it might
not be surprising at all

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.680
to folks in Silicon Valley,
that Asian Americans are very

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.810
dominant in the H-1B
visa category, which

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:10.530
is very much in the news
today in terms of what

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:13.350
the future of high-skilled
immigration to the United

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:14.880
States will look like.

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.370
And it's not just
Silicon Valley.

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:22.750
When the travel ban first went
into place, not only Google,

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:26.250
Apple, Microsoft, and
many tech companies

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:28.620
had a very strong reaction.

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:31.110
Because it would not only
disrupt their business,

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:32.865
but also went
against the, kind of,

00:05:32.865 --> 00:05:36.360
core values of what
inclusion meant

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:37.950
within these
corporate structures.

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:40.890
But you also saw universities
speaking up in ways

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:43.800
that they had never spoken
before, and quickly.

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.430
Because that also struck at
the core of PhD programs,

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.490
post-doctoral fellowships,
and employment,

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:53.500
and in professorships, and
other research positions.

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.830
Medicine, too, has been
very strongly affected

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:58.110
by the kind of
immigration changes.

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:00.240
Not only in terms of
proposed legal changes,

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.310
but executive actions
that have happened

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:03.930
in the last few months.

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:06.540
So, needless to say,
we are now recognizing

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:09.280
that Asians are an important
part of the immigration story.

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:11.520
Although when it comes to
undocumented immigration,

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.475
most people still don't
think of Asian Americans

00:06:14.475 --> 00:06:18.279
within their general conception
of who the undocumented are.

00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:19.320
Please go to our website.

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:22.470
We have a portion on
undocumented immigration, which

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:25.200
has some of these
numbers in various states

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:28.970
and also by national origin.

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:30.830
Asian Americans are
also an increasing share

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:32.630
of the foreign born.

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:35.840
So even though we've had more
Asians than Latinos coming in,

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:39.350
in terms of inflows, the
base population of who

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:43.860
the foreign born, or who
the immigrant population is,

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:46.686
is still close to
a majority Latino.

00:06:46.686 --> 00:06:47.810
But that's going to change.

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:51.200
And by 2055, there'll
be more Asian immigrants

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:53.660
in the United States than
Latino immigrants in the United

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:56.084
States.

00:06:56.084 --> 00:06:58.000
And Asian Americans are
also an important part

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.080
of the immigrant vote.

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:01.240
This is something
that I try as often

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:02.890
as I can when I
speak to journalists,

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:04.510
but even elected officials.

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:07.985
Most people when they think of
immigrant voters think Latinos.

00:07:07.985 --> 00:07:10.360
I can't tell you the number
of times in which people make

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:13.150
that easy assumption and
switch between saying

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:15.070
Latino and immigrant.

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:17.316
But, in fact, most Latinos
in the United States,

00:07:17.316 --> 00:07:18.940
no matter how you
measure them in terms

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:21.850
of the resident population,
in terms of the adult citizen

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:25.230
population, in terms of the
registered voter population,

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:28.347
they are nowhere close to a
majority immigrant, right?

00:07:28.347 --> 00:07:30.430
Depending on the numbers,
you're talking about 2/3

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:33.460
of the Latino population
as native born.

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:36.970
By contrast, Asian Americans
are a predominantly immigrant

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:38.379
population.

00:07:38.379 --> 00:07:40.420
So I keep saying, when
you talk about immigrants,

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:41.800
you have to think about Asians.

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:44.230
Then people say, well,
but the Asian population

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:45.380
is much smaller, right?

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:47.347
So maybe it still
makes sense when

00:07:47.347 --> 00:07:49.180
you talk about the
composition of immigrants

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:53.200
and immigrant voters to talk
about them as predominantly

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:54.340
Latino.

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:58.450
But even there the numbers show
a very different story, right?

00:07:58.450 --> 00:08:00.850
What we see at
the national level

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:03.700
and in states like-- and
in states like California,

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:06.370
it's actually-- you have
more Asian immigrant voters

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:08.140
than Latino voters.

00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:11.530
What you find is there are about
as many Asian immigrant voters

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:14.004
as Latino immigrant voters.

00:08:14.004 --> 00:08:16.420
So if someone's going to be
intellectually honest and talk

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:19.300
about the immigrant vote,
they cannot just talk about

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:20.542
the Latino vote.

00:08:20.542 --> 00:08:22.000
By the way, there's
a decent number

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.270
of white immigrant voters
nationally as well.

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:26.650
About a quarter of the
immigrant population

00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:29.710
that is registered to vote
is non-Hispanic white.

00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:32.140
What you'll see as a continuing
theme in this presentation

00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:34.480
is that we need to go
beyond stereotypes,

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:38.090
and look at the data, and
to educate, and sometimes

00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:39.140
re-educate ourselves.

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:41.179
I can't tell you
the number of times,

00:08:41.179 --> 00:08:44.000
even when I look at the data,
sometimes with different cuts,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.460
they surprise me,
because I'm not

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:49.910
used to thinking of some of
these populations in the way

00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:53.380
that the data reveal themselves.

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:56.890
Quite apart from looking at
the growing proportion of Asian

00:08:56.890 --> 00:08:59.680
Americans and their share
of the immigrant population,

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:02.140
other kinds of data that
people usually use to say,

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:03.820
pay attention to
Asian Americans,

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:05.450
look at their purchasing power.

00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:07.390
So Asian Americans
by 2020 are going

00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:10.750
to be worth over $1 trillion
in terms of purchasing power,

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:13.840
on par with the African
American and Latino populations

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:17.260
in the US that are much larger.

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.330
If you look at
wealth generation,

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:22.300
Asian Americans are
expected to reach parity

00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:25.210
with the non-Hispanic white
population in about 20

00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:27.864
to 30 years.

00:09:27.864 --> 00:09:30.530
And in business formation,
you see a pretty significant

00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:35.240
increase in the number
of businesses that

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:38.970
are owned by Asian Americans.

00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:40.950
So for all these reasons,
we can say that we're

00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:42.600
growing in importance.

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:44.440
We're becoming more visible.

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:46.970
We're increasing in terms
of purchasing power, wealth,

00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:47.470
et cetera.

00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:50.240
So what's the problem, right?

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:52.230
Asian Americans seem to
be doing pretty well.

00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:54.310
There does not seem
to be a problem.

00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:56.430
Well, one problem is
the model minority myth,

00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:59.130
which many of you may
have heard, right?

00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:02.040
What I've shown you so far
are aggregate statistics

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:05.709
about the Asian American
community, including on wealth,

00:10:05.709 --> 00:10:07.500
but if I showed you
something on education,

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:09.458
it would show you that
Asian Americans actually

00:10:09.458 --> 00:10:11.700
have higher levels of
educational attainment

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:14.710
than the non-Hispanic
white population.

00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:17.130
But when you take
that aggregated data

00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:20.520
at the level of racial group,
it often masks disparities.

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:22.410
And there are
significant disparities

00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:25.890
within the Asian category.

00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:29.730
This is what people call
"data disaggregation," right?

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:31.770
Whenever you are
able to get access

00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:35.010
to more fine-grained data, you
can make better inferences.

00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:37.005
This should be
pretty self-evident

00:10:37.005 --> 00:10:40.350
when you're talking
about scientific analysis

00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:41.610
or social scientific analysis.

00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:42.990
But as I'll say
in a second, it's

00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:45.030
actually become
controversial recently.

00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:47.740
But without data, we
cannot make our case.

00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:51.070
So if you look at
educational attainment,

00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:53.860
even though Asians on
average have the highest

00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:56.510
levels of educational
attainment in the country,

00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:58.770
there are huge
differences, right?

00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:02.500
So at the top you have
Taiwanese and Indian Americans

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:05.560
that have the highest levels
of those with a bachelor's

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:06.960
degree and higher.

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:09.850
By the way, Mongolian Americans
have pretty high levels

00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:12.790
of educational attainment.

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:14.480
And at the lower
end of the spectrum,

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:17.500
you have what have tended
to be predominantly

00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:20.120
refugee populations, right?

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:22.675
Vietnamese, Burmese,
Hmong, Cambodian, Laotian,

00:11:22.675 --> 00:11:25.560
and Bhutanese.

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:27.930
And the gap is just
enormous, right?

00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:32.850
From the low teens to
about 3/4 of the population

00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:36.480
that has a bachelor's
degree or higher.

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:38.850
Within the Pacific
Islander population,

00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:40.770
there are less differences,
but you'll notice

00:11:40.770 --> 00:11:42.060
the scale has changed a bit.

00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:44.940
But the highest level
of bachelor's degree

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:48.000
attainment or higher is among
the Melanesian population,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.720
which is about one in five
have a bachelor's degree, which

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:53.340
is on the lower
end of that scale

00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:55.964
when you're talking about Asian
Americans and Pacific Islanders

00:11:55.964 --> 00:11:56.520
together.

00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:59.190
This is why data
disaggregation is so vital.

00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:01.470
It's not just on
educational attainment.

00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:06.130
If you look at limited English
proficiency, huge differences

00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:08.350
between Indians,
and Sri Lankans,

00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:11.950
and Pakistanis who do
not have as high language

00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:16.730
needs versus Bhutanese, Burmese,
Vietnamese, Thai, et cetera,

00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:22.150
that have significant needs
for translation and other kinds

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:26.860
of assistance when it comes
to dealing with officials,

00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:30.760
dealing with agencies that
communicate predominantly

00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:33.010
in English.

00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:35.950
Now, we know that disaggregation
is important, and yet,

00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:37.660
recently--

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:39.020
we've seen this in Rhode Island.

00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:41.680
This is something that is
coming up in Massachusetts.

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:44.950
There was a controversy that
raged in California last year.

00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:46.930
We're seeing this as a
controversy coming up

00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:51.700
in Minnesota, where you've
had Asian American populations

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:53.680
that for decades have
been pushing for data

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:57.070
disaggregation, so they can
get a better sense if you're

00:12:57.070 --> 00:12:59.110
talking about
language assistance

00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:01.339
in terms of schools
dealing with parents.

00:13:01.339 --> 00:13:03.130
If you're talking about
language assistance

00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:04.588
when it comes to
hospitals and what

00:13:04.588 --> 00:13:06.500
they need to provide
at the local level.

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:10.060
Data disaggregation has
been central to advancing

00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:12.730
an Asian American agenda.

00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:16.720
What we found recently is
a predominantly Chinese

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:19.150
immigrant population
that are mobilized,

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:23.200
largely through WeChat
and other online networks,

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:25.360
have had a very skewed
perspective of what

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:26.800
data disaggregation means.

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:30.580
And this arose out of
California a couple of years

00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:34.270
ago where someone
convinced a bunch of people

00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:36.994
that if you're collecting
this disaggregated data,

00:13:36.994 --> 00:13:38.410
it meant that
you're going to have

00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:43.680
quotas on Chinese people
in Berkeley and Harvard.

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:45.610
That is not the intent
nor the consequence

00:13:45.610 --> 00:13:47.850
of all of these data
disaggregation pushes.

00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:51.360
These data disaggregation pushes
were intended, and designed,

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:55.650
and implemented to help
disadvantaged populations

00:13:55.650 --> 00:13:58.560
like the Hmong in
Central Valley, right?

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:01.320
Or the Cambodian
population in Long Beach.

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:04.252
But somehow this
has gotten sucked

00:14:04.252 --> 00:14:05.710
into the affirmative
action debate,

00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:08.750
and that's something we can
talk about later as well.

00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:11.510
And we've had a very
skewed perspective.

00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:14.320
So this is from a
protest in Rhode Island.

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:16.270
And we've seen this elsewhere.

00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:18.250
And what's remarkable
about these protests

00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:21.370
is the participants are very
convinced of their cause

00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:23.440
without necessarily
understanding what

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:25.277
data disaggregation is about.

00:14:25.277 --> 00:14:26.860
And I find it a
little sad, actually--

00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:28.960
and I'll editorialize
a little bit here--

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:32.040
to bring little children
holding up signs saying,

00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:37.350
I am American and don't
discriminate against me, right?

00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:40.350
Whereas the bill actually
does nothing of the sort.

00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:45.000
I'll just point to that teenager
who looks very uncomfortable

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.280
and the little
girl in a stroller.

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:48.880
Some people say
that this is great.

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:50.190
This is a sign of activism.

00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:52.680
This is a sign of the Asian
American community empowering

00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:54.250
themselves.

00:14:54.250 --> 00:14:57.120
I think we need to re-examine
what empowerment means.

00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:59.500
It's not just
simply speaking up.

00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:01.860
It's actually having
a sense of justice

00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:03.979
and knowing where we fit
into the racial order.

00:15:03.979 --> 00:15:06.270
I know that some of these
things will be controversial,

00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:10.880
and I invite conversation
and discussion.

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:12.480
So the lessons on data--

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:14.600
one thing it does
say to us, though,

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:16.520
when we look at data
disaggregation is that we

00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:19.160
cannot just assume that just
because our communities have

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:20.400
been fighting for this--

00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:22.910
we've been fighting for
this for over 30 years

00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:24.590
to try to get government
agencies to get

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:26.240
more fine-grained
data so we can have

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:28.040
more effective public policy.

00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:29.750
Just because we've
been fighting for it

00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:33.080
and convincing other people does
not mean that the work is done.

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:36.410
In fact, after all these
policy victories have occurred,

00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:38.190
now we're seeing a
new set of challenges.

00:15:38.190 --> 00:15:39.860
And we need to reach out.

00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:42.870
Both internally, within the
Asian American Pacific Islander

00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:47.190
population, but also externally
to continually make the case.

00:15:47.190 --> 00:15:49.580
We can't just assume that
once we've said something

00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:51.990
that people get it.

00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:55.050
And on this, I'll
quote Judge Mike Kwan,

00:15:55.050 --> 00:15:57.720
who's a Chinese American in
Utah, who I think put it best

00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:00.210
in terms of some of
the recent controversy.

00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:03.300
Because many of the activists
have been pushing hard

00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:06.510
against legislators, against
people like Jennifer, and I,

00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:13.950
and others saying that we're
out to, kind of, exclude Asians.

00:16:13.950 --> 00:16:15.450
That what we're
doing will introduce

00:16:15.450 --> 00:16:18.750
a new Chinese Exclusion
Act or Japanese internment.

00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:20.460
There are people who
have been advocating

00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:22.800
for data disaggregation
who've been called Nazis

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:24.566
or employing Nazi tactics.

00:16:24.566 --> 00:16:26.190
Now, I'm not just
using hyperbole here.

00:16:26.190 --> 00:16:28.140
These are verbatim
things that you

00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:32.800
will hear on WeChat, on
Twitter, and elsewhere.

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:34.770
And I think Judge
Mike Kwan put it best.

00:16:34.770 --> 00:16:37.410
"Truth is the greatest
casualty of the current times.

00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:38.340
Don't like the facts?

00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:40.029
Just call them fake
and ignore them.

00:16:40.029 --> 00:16:41.070
Don't like the messenger?

00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:43.080
Call them stupid liars.

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:45.540
The simple truth that every
community advocate who has ever

00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:47.370
sought funding for
the community knows

00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:49.500
is that data equals dollars.

00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:52.380
If you cannot demonstrate
through data that a particular

00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:56.172
group is in need of assistance,
they won't get any."

00:16:56.172 --> 00:16:58.130
So I'll just leave those
words, and I'm, again,

00:16:58.130 --> 00:17:00.270
happy to talk about
it more in the Q&amp;A.

00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:03.350
So, one, when we talk about
the story of Asian Americans'

00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:06.270
growing numbers and
increasing in their wealth,

00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:08.540
it masks this enormous
set of disparities

00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:10.560
within the population.

00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:13.520
The other problem is of
low civic engagement.

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:17.089
We generally do not vote
in nearly the same numbers

00:17:17.089 --> 00:17:20.380
as the rest of the population,
and it goes noticed, right?

00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:23.270
So if we don't participate,
our economic contributions

00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:27.650
are not recognized, we are
seen as a perpetual foreigner,

00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:31.350
and our leadership and
talent hit a bamboo ceiling.

00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:34.600
So, first, when it comes to
our economic contributions,

00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:37.300
it's not just today
that people recognize

00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:41.570
that Asian Americans are vital
to our country's economy.

00:17:41.570 --> 00:17:45.070
So these are photos
from California.

00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:49.330
One is of a Chinese miner around
the time of the gold rush,

00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:50.800
and the other is
of Chinese rail--

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:53.050
Chinese immigrants who
are railroad workers who

00:17:53.050 --> 00:17:55.060
are essential to
building the Western end

00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:57.600
of the transcontinental
railroad.

00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:00.900
The transcontinental
railroad and the benefits

00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:03.960
to the American
economy do not become

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:05.940
realized without
the contribution

00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:07.460
of Asian immigrants, right?

00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:10.140
So we're so vital to
the economic history

00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:11.790
of our country.

00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:14.610
And, yet, when you look
at the official portrait

00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:18.960
of the golden spike that
united the Western and Eastern

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:20.940
halves of the
transcontinental railroad,

00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:24.524
there's not a single
Chinese immigrant in sight.

00:18:24.524 --> 00:18:26.940
All right, so just because we
are involved in the economy,

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:30.001
that we might be vital to
certain sectors in the economy,

00:18:30.001 --> 00:18:32.250
does not mean that we're
going to get that recognition

00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:35.950
unless we're civically engaged.

00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:38.182
There's also a whole
history of laws,

00:18:38.182 --> 00:18:39.640
starting out in
California and then

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:41.920
spreading to the
rest of the country,

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:44.570
where Asian Americans
have been excluded,

00:18:44.570 --> 00:18:46.070
including Japanese
Americans who are

00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:50.860
so vital to the agricultural
sector in California.

00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:52.750
California passed
an alien land law

00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:55.300
excluding Japanese, Indian,
and other immigrants

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:57.257
from owning land.

00:18:57.257 --> 00:18:58.840
And as we all know,
Japanese Americans

00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:02.170
were interned in California
and other parts of the United

00:19:02.170 --> 00:19:05.860
States because of their
so-called perceived security

00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:08.270
threat.

00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:09.560
But this is not just history.

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:15.450
Time and again we've seen that
when you have economic anxiety

00:19:15.450 --> 00:19:20.310
and scapegoating, we've seen an
uptick in anti-Asian violence.

00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:23.160
So you have an image there
from anti-Chinese riots

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:26.190
in Denver in 1880,
the Vincent Chin

00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:28.650
murder that many
people, especially

00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:30.150
within the Asian
American community,

00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:33.810
recognize and commemorate,
and most recently

00:19:33.810 --> 00:19:37.960
the brutal murder of Srinivas
Kuchibhotla in Kansas, which

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:41.160
the Asian American community
is still, we would argue,

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:44.670
not commemorating quite
with the same fervor

00:19:44.670 --> 00:19:46.830
as we remember the
Vincent Chin incident.

00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:49.730
In fact, if you look in 2017--

00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:52.320
this slide is actually
based on incidents

00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:54.760
just in the first
half of the year.

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:58.320
Some very prominent
incidents of hate crimes

00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:01.650
against Asian Americans,
predominantly targeting

00:20:01.650 --> 00:20:02.280
South Asians.

00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:09.270
And it's not just in terms of
violence in society, right?

00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:11.300
So this is a very
prominent individual

00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:13.630
no longer in the White House.

00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:16.790
I don't know if people remember
the context of this quote.

00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:21.780
This was Steve Bannon when he
was the chief of Breitbart,

00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:26.450
and speaking with then
candidate Donald Trump.

00:20:26.450 --> 00:20:28.669
So this is in December 2015.

00:20:28.669 --> 00:20:30.710
And when Trump was saying
that maybe not everyone

00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:32.320
should be sent back--

00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:35.600
that with some high-skilled
immigrants, college graduates,

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:37.370
they should remain
in the country.

00:20:37.370 --> 00:20:39.800
And Bannon said,
well, "when 2/3 or 3/4

00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:43.260
of CEOs in Silicon Valley are
from South Asia or from Asia--"

00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:46.070
first of all, by the way,
that is totally false.

00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:50.440
It's a minuscule fraction
of Silicon Valley CEOs

00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:53.720
that are Asian American,
let alone South Asian.

00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:55.860
But here's another
thing he says.

00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:58.040
And I think we should
actually take this latter part

00:20:58.040 --> 00:20:59.780
very seriously.

00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:02.360
"A country is more
than an economy.

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:04.910
We're a civic society."

00:21:04.910 --> 00:21:07.040
What Bannon means
by that is actually

00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:10.400
an ethnic nationalist vision
of what a civic society means.

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:12.560
But there is this
larger problem.

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:16.310
If we're only seen as economic
actors and not civic actors,

00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:19.190
it makes it very easy
for those in power

00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:21.080
to exclude us from
the civic sphere.

00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:24.750
And we're seeing that.

00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:26.760
We're seeing that with
the RAISE Act, which

00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:29.190
proposes to cut family visas.

00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:30.840
Now, many Asian
Americans, including

00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:33.357
Asian Americans that are
highly skilled might think,

00:21:33.357 --> 00:21:33.940
you know what?

00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:36.460
We're going to be--
we're going to be OK.

00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:38.410
Because we have high
skills, and, therefore,

00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:40.780
Asian immigration is not
going to be affected.

00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:43.090
Well, over half of
Asian immigrants

00:21:43.090 --> 00:21:46.330
coming to the United States on
legal permanent resident visas

00:21:46.330 --> 00:21:48.857
come in through
family sponsorships.

00:21:48.857 --> 00:21:50.440
So it is going to
affect us, including

00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:52.220
those that have high skills.

00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:56.710
Many of them depend on
bringing relatives over

00:21:56.710 --> 00:22:00.440
to make a new life
in the United States.

00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:03.650
Just recently we put out a
blog post in the AAPI Data,

00:22:03.650 --> 00:22:05.780
and also created
infographics, showing

00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:08.750
how the proposed
cuts to family visas

00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:10.920
would affect
different populations.

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:14.000
And as you can see,
it would affect

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.207
close to a majority of most
detailed Asian origin groups,

00:22:18.207 --> 00:22:20.540
including Indian Americans,
Chinese Americans, Japanese,

00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:24.920
Filipinos, Pakistanis,
Bangladeshis, and Vietnamese.

00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:27.570
All right, so this an issue
that is hot right now,

00:22:27.570 --> 00:22:29.670
we have to be engaged in.

00:22:29.670 --> 00:22:32.930
But it is rare, it is rare
to see Asian Americans out

00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:34.770
in the streets.

00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:37.240
There were a set
of actions that we

00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:41.284
helped to catalyze last week,
but they were nowhere close

00:22:41.284 --> 00:22:42.700
to the kinds of
actions that we've

00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:45.040
seen on the Dream
Act, and other actions

00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:48.940
that Latinos have done on
behalf of immigrant rights.

00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:50.920
So we absolutely
need to speak up.

00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:52.540
Participation is key.

00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:54.220
It's key to building power.

00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:56.920
It's key to fighting racism.

00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:58.540
And quite honestly,
per Steve Bannon,

00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:00.520
it is key to being
seen as American.

00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:02.560
If we're not there
in the civic sphere,

00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:06.520
people are not going to see us
as part of the body politic.

00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:09.510
So we've got a
lot of work to do.

00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:13.820
This is part of a speech that
Barack Obama gave in 2016.

00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:16.190
And people generally were
in a celebratory mood,

00:23:16.190 --> 00:23:17.422
including the president.

00:23:17.422 --> 00:23:19.880
He said "the AAPI community is
the fastest growing minority

00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:22.842
in America, but it's still--"
like, everyone is clapping,

00:23:22.842 --> 00:23:24.050
you know, everyone's excited.

00:23:24.050 --> 00:23:26.450
"Well, that's good
to cheer about,

00:23:26.450 --> 00:23:29.240
but it's still significantly
underrepresented at the ballot

00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:30.260
box.

00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:33.500
In 2012 just 56% of
eligible AAPI voters

00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:36.460
were registered to vote."

00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:39.540
Now, the president wasn't just
saying that to be a downer.

00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:42.600
It was a very realistic
sense of where we stand.

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:44.190
People know that
we're important,

00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:46.560
people know that
we're growing fast,

00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:49.320
but they also know that
we under-participate.

00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:51.007
It's not a secret, right?

00:23:51.007 --> 00:23:52.840
This is one of the
things you get with data.

00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:55.780
People know, and especially
elected officials know

00:23:55.780 --> 00:23:57.690
if you're a group
that participates,

00:23:57.690 --> 00:24:01.477
and if you're a group
that not-- that doesn't.

00:24:01.477 --> 00:24:02.310
And we've seen that.

00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:03.601
We've seen that in voting data.

00:24:03.601 --> 00:24:06.510
Asian Americans vote
at much lower rates

00:24:06.510 --> 00:24:12.190
than non-Hispanic whites
and African Americans.

00:24:12.190 --> 00:24:13.800
It is also true in registration.

00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:15.970
So here's a different
look at the data.

00:24:15.970 --> 00:24:18.344
And you see big differences
within the Asian category,

00:24:18.344 --> 00:24:19.760
in terms of what
voting looks like

00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:21.670
and what registration
looks like.

00:24:21.670 --> 00:24:24.171
Indian Americans tend to
participate more than others.

00:24:24.171 --> 00:24:25.920
Which is actually a
little bit surprising,

00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:28.400
given that they are among
the most recently arrived

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:29.300
to the United States.

00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:31.008
And we can talk more
in the Q&amp;A about why

00:24:31.008 --> 00:24:32.190
that might be the case.

00:24:32.190 --> 00:24:34.280
Chinese Americans
have the lowest rates

00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:37.930
of voter registration
and voter turnout.

00:24:37.930 --> 00:24:40.210
But it's not just voting.

00:24:40.210 --> 00:24:43.290
Asian Americans, as
you'll see just below--

00:24:43.290 --> 00:24:46.410
just above the bottom there are
much less likely than others

00:24:46.410 --> 00:24:49.420
to contact public officials.

00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:53.690
They're also much less
likely to engage in boycotts.

00:24:53.690 --> 00:24:58.610
And they're the least likely
to engage in protest activity.

00:24:58.610 --> 00:25:00.850
So even though many of us,
including many Googlers,

00:25:00.850 --> 00:25:04.040
might have been involved
in the various travel ban

00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:09.100
protests that occurred
in January of this year--

00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:11.370
even when it comes
to protest behavior

00:25:11.370 --> 00:25:13.800
where so much of our
interests are at stake,

00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:16.500
we are much less likely
to do so than the rest

00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:18.920
of the population.

00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:22.340
So to sum up, we need to
redefine Asian success.

00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:25.180
Many of us just think
about economic success.

00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:27.650
Well, first of all, maybe
even before economic success,

00:25:27.650 --> 00:25:31.420
many of us are socialized
into thinking about GPA

00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:33.000
and academic achievement.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.530
And then maybe after
that, wealth generation.

00:25:35.530 --> 00:25:39.850
But we need to redefine
success to not only mean

00:25:39.850 --> 00:25:43.630
economic advancement, but
also political participation,

00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:47.800
civic participation, and
philanthropic activity.

00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:49.960
And the success not only
of our community, but also

00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:52.870
larger society depends on it.

00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:55.300
Fortunately, we can draw
upon the inspiration

00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:59.650
of many Asian American
heroes and she-roes.

00:25:59.650 --> 00:26:05.080
So, for example, Wong Kim
Ark in 1898 helps establish

00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:08.020
the bedrock of birthright
citizenship that every

00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:12.220
immigrant depends on, which
is that if your child is born

00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:14.530
in the United States,
citizenship cannot be denied

00:26:14.530 --> 00:26:15.680
to that child.

00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:19.090
It an Asian American help
who helped establish that.

00:26:19.090 --> 00:26:22.360
The first Asian American elected
to Congress, congressman Dalip

00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:23.410
Singh Saund.

00:26:23.410 --> 00:26:26.050
He had fought for the right
for Indians and Filipinos

00:26:26.050 --> 00:26:27.420
to naturalize.

00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:29.260
And within two years
of getting naturalized,

00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:31.360
he runs as a judge.

00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:32.980
And then when he first--

00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:35.465
and then after becoming a
judge, he then runs for Congress

00:26:35.465 --> 00:26:37.840
and becomes the first Asian
American elected to Congress.

00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:40.834
So we can draw upon all these
inspiring stories, right?

00:26:40.834 --> 00:26:43.000
It is rare now when people
get naturalized thinking,

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:43.583
you know what?

00:26:43.583 --> 00:26:44.750
I'm going to vote.

00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:46.750
In my next election, I'm
going to run for Judge,

00:26:46.750 --> 00:26:48.190
and I'm going to
run for Congress.

00:26:48.190 --> 00:26:51.006
But we should look
to those examples.

00:26:51.006 --> 00:26:53.380
And we have heroes from all
of our different communities.

00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:54.890
This is one of the
things many people think,

00:26:54.890 --> 00:26:56.931
well, you know what, our
community is so diverse.

00:26:56.931 --> 00:26:58.150
It's hopelessly diverse.

00:26:58.150 --> 00:27:00.520
We can actually see
diversity as a strength.

00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:05.150
Because every one of our groups
have these inspiring examples,

00:27:05.150 --> 00:27:07.450
including Fred
Korematsu who fought

00:27:07.450 --> 00:27:09.700
the constitutionality
of internment.

00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:13.540
Or Larry Itliong who was as
important as Cesar Chavez

00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:18.340
to the establishment
of United Farm Workers.

00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:21.220
And, finally, we should
look for inspiration,

00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:23.890
not only within our
community, but also

00:27:23.890 --> 00:27:26.290
with other marginalized
communities, including

00:27:26.290 --> 00:27:27.969
other people of color.

00:27:27.969 --> 00:27:28.885
And I love this photo.

00:27:28.885 --> 00:27:33.040
This is a photo of Martin
Luther King in Selma

00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:35.830
wearing Hawaiian Leis, right?

00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:38.290
And this was a
gift that was sent

00:27:38.290 --> 00:27:43.530
by Reverend Akaka to
Martin Luther King

00:27:43.530 --> 00:27:46.470
to show the solidarity
of Pacific Islanders

00:27:46.470 --> 00:27:48.110
with African Americans.

00:27:48.110 --> 00:27:50.790
And this solidarity
remains as vital today

00:27:50.790 --> 00:27:54.059
as it did during the 1960s
civil rights movement.

00:27:54.059 --> 00:27:56.350
It is important for us to
recognize that our faiths are

00:27:56.350 --> 00:27:57.400
interlinked.

00:27:57.400 --> 00:27:59.940
That if you talk about
Asian American empowerment,

00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:03.120
it is fundamentally linked to
the empowerment of other groups

00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:05.256
that are marginalized
in this society.

00:28:05.256 --> 00:28:07.380
Thank you for your time
and I'll now switch it over

00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:09.150
to Jennifer Lee, who'll talk
about the National Asian

00:28:09.150 --> 00:28:10.158
American survey.

00:28:10.158 --> 00:28:12.448
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:13.314 --> 00:28:14.730
JENNIFER LEE: Thank
you, Karthick.

00:28:14.730 --> 00:28:19.220
I love that he added
she-roes to the hero label.

00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:22.730
Thank you, Amy for inviting us
and for organizing this event.

00:28:22.730 --> 00:28:24.410
And thank you all
for being here.

00:28:24.410 --> 00:28:25.910
For those who are
live streaming,

00:28:25.910 --> 00:28:27.650
we really appreciate
the audience

00:28:27.650 --> 00:28:29.630
and we'd love to
hear your feedback.

00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:31.580
What I'm going to do
is switch gears a bit

00:28:31.580 --> 00:28:34.610
and talk about the National
Asian American Survey,

00:28:34.610 --> 00:28:37.010
and some of the data that's
come from the National Asian

00:28:37.010 --> 00:28:37.790
American Survey.

00:28:37.790 --> 00:28:40.550
And just to underscore
a few points,

00:28:40.550 --> 00:28:43.730
it was funded by a
number of foundations

00:28:43.730 --> 00:28:45.810
without which it would
not have launched.

00:28:45.810 --> 00:28:47.690
So the National
Science Foundation

00:28:47.690 --> 00:28:51.380
has been a strong contributor,
as has the Russell Sage

00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:51.950
Foundation.

00:28:51.950 --> 00:28:55.760
And our program director is
in the audience, [INAUDIBLE]..

00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:59.270
And I wanted to thank her
personally for her help.

00:28:59.270 --> 00:29:01.460
I wanted to talk--
start off by talking

00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:05.090
about what makes the National
Asian American Survey unique.

00:29:05.090 --> 00:29:08.120
If you read newspapers
and you see statistics,

00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:12.720
you see oftentimes percentages
of what whites support policy--

00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:14.960
what percentage
of white Americans

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:17.090
support a particular policy.

00:29:17.090 --> 00:29:18.730
What percentage
African Americans

00:29:18.730 --> 00:29:21.140
support a policy, or Latinos.

00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:24.890
What you often see missing
is data on Asian Americans.

00:29:24.890 --> 00:29:28.160
And so, what the National
Asian American does--

00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:31.610
Survey does is help fill
the substantive void

00:29:31.610 --> 00:29:34.580
to provide data
on Asian Americans

00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:36.290
at the national level.

00:29:36.290 --> 00:29:38.345
What's unique about the
Asian American Survey

00:29:38.345 --> 00:29:40.910
is that rather than
focusing on just

00:29:40.910 --> 00:29:44.960
a couple of Asian ethnic
groups, we choose ten.

00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:48.800
So the sixth largest,
which are Asians,

00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:53.330
Asian Indians, Chinese,
Filipinos, Koreans, Vietnamese,

00:29:53.330 --> 00:29:54.380
Japanese.

00:29:54.380 --> 00:29:57.530
We also include
Cambodian and Hmong.

00:29:57.530 --> 00:29:59.450
And we also include,
for the first time,

00:29:59.450 --> 00:30:03.050
Bangladeshis and Pakistanis,
who have never been included

00:30:03.050 --> 00:30:05.480
in a national survey at all.

00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:08.630
What's also unique about the
National Asian American Survey

00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:12.230
is that we conducted the
survey in both English

00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:14.090
and in an Asian ethnic language.

00:30:14.090 --> 00:30:16.730
And why that's important,
as Karthick mentioned,

00:30:16.730 --> 00:30:21.190
2/3 of the Asian American
population is foreign born.

00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:25.670
And many have-- are limited in
English language proficiency.

00:30:25.670 --> 00:30:28.017
The problem is that
a lot of surveys

00:30:28.017 --> 00:30:29.725
that have been conducted
in the past that

00:30:29.725 --> 00:30:33.980
have focused on Asian Americans
were only available in English.

00:30:33.980 --> 00:30:37.940
What that does is
then bias the results

00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:42.110
to those who are English
fluent and typically younger.

00:30:42.110 --> 00:30:44.060
And so we actually
had the survey

00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:48.630
translated in a number
of different languages.

00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:52.220
So let me begin by talking
about some of the problems

00:30:52.220 --> 00:30:54.130
that Asian Americans face.

00:30:54.130 --> 00:30:57.860
As Karthick says, some of the
rhetoric and some of the images

00:30:57.860 --> 00:31:01.640
of Asian Americans is that
we are a highly educated--

00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:05.570
uniformly highly educated
group, a high achieving group

00:31:05.570 --> 00:31:08.990
with high median household
incomes, or highly employed.

00:31:08.990 --> 00:31:11.150
We have high
self-employment rates.

00:31:11.150 --> 00:31:12.800
That we're doing just fine.

00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:15.740
We're assimilating just
fine, and on the way

00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:19.070
to becoming white, or at
least honorary whites.

00:31:19.070 --> 00:31:22.030
So that is some of the
dominant narrative, right?

00:31:22.030 --> 00:31:24.380
And so what are
some of the problems

00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:26.120
that Asian Americans face?

00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:28.160
So we asked this question.

00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:31.670
And so, at the top
of the list was

00:31:31.670 --> 00:31:35.670
affordability of college,
the cost of medical care,

00:31:35.670 --> 00:31:36.860
the cost of elderly care.

00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:39.710
And as you can see,
a number of problems

00:31:39.710 --> 00:31:43.820
that Asian American respondents
explained are problems.

00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:45.860
And in the actual--

00:31:45.860 --> 00:31:48.620
in our survey data, we have
it broken down by ethnic group

00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:50.060
if you're interested.

00:31:50.060 --> 00:31:53.750
I wanted to point to a
particular slide, which

00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:55.430
is bullying.

00:31:55.430 --> 00:31:59.600
So bullying apparently is a
particularly strong problem

00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:01.910
among some Asian ethnic groups.

00:32:01.910 --> 00:32:04.340
If you look at the
Hmong, for instance,

00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:10.730
46% of Hmong Americans
have listed bullying

00:32:10.730 --> 00:32:13.310
as a very serious problem.

00:32:13.310 --> 00:32:17.630
And it's Hmong, Pakistani,
Indian, Bangladeshi.

00:32:17.630 --> 00:32:19.190
What's the pattern here?

00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:21.470
One of the things we're
seeing in our data

00:32:21.470 --> 00:32:24.590
is this divergence
of experiences

00:32:24.590 --> 00:32:27.080
between South Asians
on the one hand

00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:29.040
and East Asians on the other.

00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:33.380
So it's not as though Chinese,
Koreans, and Japanese don't

00:32:33.380 --> 00:32:36.980
experience bullying, but they're
not experiencing it nearly

00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:40.130
at the same rate as
South Asian Americans.

00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:44.330
And this gets to another
point that Karthick and I

00:32:44.330 --> 00:32:46.760
found in our data
that we, actually, we

00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:49.970
wrote about in an op-ed,
which is that when

00:32:49.970 --> 00:32:55.340
we talk about Asian Americans,
often times Americans, not only

00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:57.740
white Americans, black
Americans, Latino Americans,

00:32:57.740 --> 00:33:00.800
but also Asian
Americans seem to have

00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:05.780
an idea of what Asian American
is or who an Asian American is.

00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:09.830
And oftentimes we're thinking
about East Asians exclusively.

00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:12.570
I mean, just to look
at this audience is

00:33:12.570 --> 00:33:14.070
kind of interesting
because Karthick

00:33:14.070 --> 00:33:17.085
and I were remarking that
this is a talk about Asian

00:33:17.085 --> 00:33:20.340
Americans, but even this
audience, the live audience,

00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:22.620
is predominantly East Asian.

00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:26.804
So there's something in the way
we conceive of Asian Americans.

00:33:26.804 --> 00:33:28.470
There is something
in the way that we're

00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:32.730
behaving that is
creating this division

00:33:32.730 --> 00:33:36.870
and excluding South
Asians from the fold.

00:33:36.870 --> 00:33:41.520
Why that's important is because
when we talk about experiences

00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:43.740
with discrimination,
with bullying,

00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:46.390
we're selecting a
particular narrative

00:33:46.390 --> 00:33:47.790
and excluding certain groups.

00:33:50.690 --> 00:33:53.810
On that point, I wanted to
talk about some experience

00:33:53.810 --> 00:33:57.070
with discrimination that
have come up in our survey.

00:33:57.070 --> 00:33:59.420
So the first is with police.

00:33:59.420 --> 00:34:04.100
Again, what we see is a
different set of experiences

00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:08.480
between Cambodian, Indian,
Hmong, Pakistanis who are South

00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:12.790
Asians versus Koreans,
Chinese, Vietnamese.

00:34:12.790 --> 00:34:15.230
That South Asians are
more likely to have

00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:19.460
had negative experiences with
the police than East Asians.

00:34:22.010 --> 00:34:25.610
If we look at the
question of whether anyone

00:34:25.610 --> 00:34:28.550
has felt that they've been
unfairly denied a promotion,

00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:31.010
we see a different
pattern emerging.

00:34:31.010 --> 00:34:33.800
We see that among Asian
Americans, more generally,

00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:38.030
14% attest that they feel like
they've been unfairly denied

00:34:38.030 --> 00:34:39.170
a promotion.

00:34:39.170 --> 00:34:43.610
But if you look at the groups
who respond even more highly,

00:34:43.610 --> 00:34:44.960
it's Filipinos and Indians.

00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:47.900
And why this is interesting
is that these groups

00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:50.000
tend to be more
likely represented

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.310
as white collar professionals.

00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:54.980
And so, is it
possible that those

00:34:54.980 --> 00:34:59.030
who are more likely to
be in mixed settings,

00:34:59.030 --> 00:35:01.250
in professional
settings, are more

00:35:01.250 --> 00:35:05.620
likely to experience the
bamboo ceiling, so to speak?

00:35:05.620 --> 00:35:08.390
And so this is something that
Karthick and I are working on.

00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:13.520
Trying to understand, not
only the figures about who

00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:15.590
feels they've been
unfairly denied,

00:35:15.590 --> 00:35:17.870
but what are some of
the mechanisms that

00:35:17.870 --> 00:35:20.600
are suppressing advancement
among Asian Americans?

00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:23.600
And just to give
you a statistic,

00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:26.660
among Asian American
college educated

00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:30.060
males, when you hold
all things constant,

00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:34.970
like where they went to school,
their major, where they live,

00:35:34.970 --> 00:35:37.430
all sorts of-- a
host of factors,

00:35:37.430 --> 00:35:40.520
they make 8% less
than white males who

00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:42.800
are comparable on every scale.

00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:46.190
Asian American women earn
as much as white women,

00:35:46.190 --> 00:35:49.520
but they're less likely to
be in supervisory positions.

00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:52.640
So they are less
likely to be promoted

00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:54.530
to the managerial ranks.

00:35:54.530 --> 00:35:58.100
So even when you attain
the right degrees,

00:35:58.100 --> 00:35:59.660
even if you go to
the right school,

00:35:59.660 --> 00:36:02.240
even if you have the
right experience, that,

00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:06.020
for some reason, we're not doing
as well in the labor market

00:36:06.020 --> 00:36:08.980
as we should.

00:36:08.980 --> 00:36:12.760
Another thing that came up,
about 1/5 of Asian Americans

00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:16.420
report that they receive
poor service in restaurants

00:36:16.420 --> 00:36:17.200
and stores.

00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:19.760
And again, you see an
interesting pattern

00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:22.450
where Filipino, Hmong,
Indian, Bangladeshi

00:36:22.450 --> 00:36:25.780
are more likely to
report this as a problem

00:36:25.780 --> 00:36:27.385
than other Asian ethnic groups.

00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:32.360
This, I think, many
of us have experienced

00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:34.520
at one point in our lives.

00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:37.700
For how many have you
received a comment

00:36:37.700 --> 00:36:39.590
that people are either
surprised that you

00:36:39.590 --> 00:36:44.120
speak English or surprised
that you speak English well?

00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:47.860
So that is at least half here.

00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:52.040
And you are Googlers, so
I presume that all of you

00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:53.400
are fluent in English.

00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:57.230
But, so, about 30% of
Asian American respondents

00:36:57.230 --> 00:37:01.490
report that people act as
if they don't speak English.

00:37:01.490 --> 00:37:04.920
And, again, you see
variation among the groups.

00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:06.980
And this is a theme
that Karthick and I

00:37:06.980 --> 00:37:09.200
will continue to speak about.

00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:12.440
That on the whole, there
is tremendous diversity

00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:13.820
among Asian Americans.

00:37:13.820 --> 00:37:19.670
Yet, at the same time, there's
a similar pattern that emerges.

00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:22.070
This is another thing
that I think many of us

00:37:22.070 --> 00:37:25.730
have experienced, that you've
had your name mispronounced.

00:37:25.730 --> 00:37:27.890
How many people have had
their name mispronounced

00:37:27.890 --> 00:37:30.930
at some point in their lives?

00:37:30.930 --> 00:37:33.620
So much so that I'll just
draw my own experience.

00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:35.990
So my first name
is a Korean name.

00:37:35.990 --> 00:37:38.870
It's [? Geyaun. ?] When
I became naturalized--

00:37:38.870 --> 00:37:40.970
I don't even know if
Karthick knows this story.

00:37:40.970 --> 00:37:43.340
When I became naturalized,
I had the choice

00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:45.050
to add a middle name.

00:37:45.050 --> 00:37:49.520
And so, I added Jennifer because
I was actually very tired

00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:53.540
of having to say my first name
over and over again, or have

00:37:53.540 --> 00:37:58.370
a substitute teacher come in,
and stop at my name, and pause.

00:37:58.370 --> 00:38:00.140
Yet, if you think
about [? Geyaun ?]

00:38:00.140 --> 00:38:02.910
it's not phonetically difficult.

00:38:02.910 --> 00:38:04.700
And if you think
about it, we work

00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:08.690
really hard to say
white ethnic names that

00:38:08.690 --> 00:38:11.810
seem impossible to pronounce.

00:38:11.810 --> 00:38:14.600
Yet for some reason
Asian ethnic names

00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:17.690
are difficult to pronounce,
and people don't even try.

00:38:17.690 --> 00:38:22.190
So, again, about 2/3
of Asian Americans

00:38:22.190 --> 00:38:24.830
have experienced
this, particularly

00:38:24.830 --> 00:38:28.860
Indians and Japanese.

00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:30.836
This is another
thing that I suspect

00:38:30.836 --> 00:38:32.710
many people in the
audience have experienced.

00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:35.520
That people assume
because you're Asian,

00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:37.720
you're good at math and science.

00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:40.410
And so, I'd love to see a
show of hands of how many have

00:38:40.410 --> 00:38:43.140
experienced this?

00:38:43.140 --> 00:38:47.880
So, math and science are not
my particular forte, actually.

00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:51.000
But I think most
people assume that I'm

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:52.440
good at math and science.

00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:55.140
And people assume
that most Asians

00:38:55.140 --> 00:38:56.850
are good at math and science.

00:38:56.850 --> 00:38:59.760
Again, are perceptions.

00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:03.240
And this might seem like
a positive stereotype

00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:04.350
in some ways.

00:39:04.350 --> 00:39:06.090
But one of the things
that Karthick and I

00:39:06.090 --> 00:39:08.910
will write about, and
are writing about,

00:39:08.910 --> 00:39:10.800
is that in some
ways, when you're

00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:15.360
perceived to be so good at
technical skills, oftentimes

00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:18.360
you're also perceived
to lack social skills,

00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:21.630
or so-called soft
skills, that are needed

00:39:21.630 --> 00:39:24.550
for leadership positions.

00:39:24.550 --> 00:39:27.300
I wanted to go on and
talk a little bit more

00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:29.460
about some of the opinion data.

00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:31.860
So, oftentimes, Asian
Americans are perceived

00:39:31.860 --> 00:39:34.110
as just caring about education.

00:39:34.110 --> 00:39:36.420
Just getting into
the top schools.

00:39:36.420 --> 00:39:39.420
But we're actually--
we have strong opinions

00:39:39.420 --> 00:39:41.460
about public policies.

00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:44.910
We're very strongly
against a Muslim ban.

00:39:44.910 --> 00:39:47.760
And this is uniform
across groups.

00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:53.340
About 2/3 of Asian Americans
are against a Muslim ban

00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:55.980
that Trump has proposed.

00:39:55.980 --> 00:39:59.280
Asian Indians evinced the
strongest opposition, almost

00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:03.570
80% are against the Muslim ban.

00:40:03.570 --> 00:40:07.230
We also strongly
and somewhat agree

00:40:07.230 --> 00:40:09.450
that undocumented
immigrants should

00:40:09.450 --> 00:40:11.860
have a pathway to citizenship.

00:40:11.860 --> 00:40:16.600
That on the question of
undocumented immigrants, Asian

00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:21.210
Americans agree that
there should be a pathway.

00:40:21.210 --> 00:40:23.760
And our numbers are
very much in line

00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:26.760
with those of white, black,
and Latino Americans.

00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:30.610
Latino is a little
bit higher, actually.

00:40:30.610 --> 00:40:32.470
This is another
slide that I thought

00:40:32.470 --> 00:40:34.690
was very important
to point out, which

00:40:34.690 --> 00:40:39.850
is that one of the things
that oftentimes gets enmeshed

00:40:39.850 --> 00:40:42.280
in the debate about
affirmative action

00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:46.210
is this idea that
Asian Americans only

00:40:46.210 --> 00:40:47.570
care about themselves.

00:40:47.570 --> 00:40:52.720
But one of the things we
find is that 72% strongly

00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:54.730
support that the
government do more

00:40:54.730 --> 00:40:58.720
to ensure equal rights between
black and white Americans.

00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:01.870
This is an incredibly
high percentage.

00:41:01.870 --> 00:41:04.480
And in some ways, it
even surprised me.

00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:07.270
But I think this underscores
the point that we

00:41:07.270 --> 00:41:09.400
are a multifaceted group.

00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:12.340
That we care more than
just about getting

00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:13.370
in the right colleges.

00:41:13.370 --> 00:41:16.800
We care more than about
just getting the right jobs.

00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:19.900
That we have very
much, very diverse

00:41:19.900 --> 00:41:23.530
set of interests that are
not oftentimes profiled

00:41:23.530 --> 00:41:26.270
in the media.

00:41:26.270 --> 00:41:28.670
We're also very committed
to climate change

00:41:28.670 --> 00:41:31.340
and environmental issues,
again, which is something

00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:34.340
that the media does
not particularly

00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:37.040
point out about our population.

00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:39.550
Since I'm running out of time,
actually, this is perfect,

00:41:39.550 --> 00:41:41.330
I'm going to hand it
back over to Karthick

00:41:41.330 --> 00:41:44.300
who's going to talk about
the presidential vote choice.

00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:45.630
KARTHICK RAMAKRISHNAN: And I'll
just say this very quickly.

00:41:45.630 --> 00:41:46.850
Thank you, Jennifer.

00:41:46.850 --> 00:41:50.070
We also have data on how
Asian Americans voted.

00:41:50.070 --> 00:41:53.270
And, in fact, it's different
from what the exit polls show,

00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:55.400
which were not done
in Asian languages.

00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:59.490
Those were only done
in English and Spanish.

00:41:59.490 --> 00:42:01.580
And we-- well, I'll get
to that in a second.

00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:04.280
One thing about 2016 is
that it was a record setting

00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:06.260
year for Asian Americans.

00:42:06.260 --> 00:42:08.990
So we doubled our
normal increase

00:42:08.990 --> 00:42:11.840
in terms of the increase
in Asian American voters

00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:13.610
per presidential cycle.

00:42:13.610 --> 00:42:16.820
In terms of how Asian Americans
voted, across the board,

00:42:16.820 --> 00:42:19.350
Asian Americans favored
Clinton over Trump,

00:42:19.350 --> 00:42:21.890
although there are some
significant differences.

00:42:21.890 --> 00:42:24.350
Before we surveyed
Bangladeshis and Pakistanis,

00:42:24.350 --> 00:42:26.120
it used to be that
Indian Americans were

00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:29.300
among the bluest
of Asian Americans,

00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:32.780
but maybe not surprisingly
given the role

00:42:32.780 --> 00:42:35.569
of anti-Muslim rhetoric
in the election this year,

00:42:35.569 --> 00:42:37.610
and given the fact that
Bangladeshi and Pakistani

00:42:37.610 --> 00:42:41.340
Americans are a predominantly
Muslim population here,

00:42:41.340 --> 00:42:46.380
that they showed the highest
level of support for Clinton.

00:42:46.380 --> 00:42:48.900
Still, we have a fair
number of Asian Americans

00:42:48.900 --> 00:42:52.740
who do not identify as either
Democrat or Republican,

00:42:52.740 --> 00:42:55.350
although that's a
three-point partisan scale.

00:42:55.350 --> 00:42:56.924
What political
scientists do is they

00:42:56.924 --> 00:42:59.340
take people who say that they're
independent and ask them,

00:42:59.340 --> 00:43:02.880
are you closer to the Republican
Party or the Democratic Party?

00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:05.100
Overall, we see that
the Democratic Party

00:43:05.100 --> 00:43:07.980
has a pretty strong
advantage, except among

00:43:07.980 --> 00:43:10.287
Vietnamese Chinese, and
Cambodian Americans.

00:43:10.287 --> 00:43:12.120
And among Chinese
Americans, actually, we're

00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:15.630
seeing a drift, a
shift perhaps related

00:43:15.630 --> 00:43:17.130
to some of the
conservative activism

00:43:17.130 --> 00:43:19.170
that we've seen in
the last few years.

00:43:19.170 --> 00:43:21.900
But potentially other
broader demographic trends

00:43:21.900 --> 00:43:24.000
in which we're seeing
a rightward shift

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:26.700
among Chinese American voters.

00:43:26.700 --> 00:43:29.257
And then finally, even though
Asian Americans are growing

00:43:29.257 --> 00:43:30.840
and they're getting
more active, we've

00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:34.730
had a record increase in
Asian American voters,

00:43:34.730 --> 00:43:36.330
Asian Americans
are still much less

00:43:36.330 --> 00:43:38.850
likely to be
contacted by parties.

00:43:38.850 --> 00:43:41.640
And this sets up a
bit of a catch-22.

00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:43.200
Parties are more
likely to contact

00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:45.240
those that are registered
with the party,

00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:48.270
consistently vote, and have
strong party identification.

00:43:48.270 --> 00:43:50.730
Asian Americans tend
to index low on that

00:43:50.730 --> 00:43:53.760
compared to the non-Hispanic
white and black populations.

00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:57.420
But party contact itself also
increases all of those things.

00:43:57.420 --> 00:44:01.950
All right, so just like you have
a virtuous cycle among whites

00:44:01.950 --> 00:44:05.670
and African Americans where more
contact means more engagement,

00:44:05.670 --> 00:44:07.470
Asian Americans
seem, so far, to be

00:44:07.470 --> 00:44:10.980
trapped in a vicious cycle of
less contact, less engagement,

00:44:10.980 --> 00:44:12.590
less subsequent contact.

00:44:12.590 --> 00:44:15.180
And we need to find out ways
to break out of this cycle.

00:44:15.180 --> 00:44:16.140
So I'll end with that.

00:44:16.140 --> 00:44:19.914
And if Jennifer can join me
up here, well take some Q&amp;A.

00:44:19.914 --> 00:44:21.390
AMY: Great, thank you so much.

00:44:21.390 --> 00:44:22.833
[APPLAUSE]

00:44:23.735 --> 00:44:26.880
So we have two mics in the
audience for live questions.

00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:28.180
JENNIFER LEE: This is Kaya.

00:44:28.180 --> 00:44:30.055
AMY: And so, if you have
a question, go ahead

00:44:30.055 --> 00:44:33.666
and stand up and ask.

00:44:33.666 --> 00:44:35.040
But, you know,
the first question

00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:37.380
that I kind of want
to get a sense of

00:44:37.380 --> 00:44:40.530
is, you know, you mentioned that
you believe the model minority

00:44:40.530 --> 00:44:42.780
myth is one of the
biggest challenges facing

00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:44.110
our community.

00:44:44.110 --> 00:44:46.450
What are some ways we can
think about combating it?

00:44:46.450 --> 00:44:48.450
KARTHICK RAMAKRISHNAN:
So I'm going to-- someone

00:44:48.450 --> 00:44:49.500
actually tweeted at me.

00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:54.247
Because I tweeted that we
were speaking of Google, and--

00:44:54.247 --> 00:44:56.580
so this gets to the model
minority thing, this something

00:44:56.580 --> 00:44:57.580
the Google can do.

00:44:57.580 --> 00:44:58.390
So this is a--

00:44:58.390 --> 00:45:00.880
this is like civic
engagement live in action.

00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:02.760
Jason Fong, who
by the way started

00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:04.260
blogging when he
was a high schooler

00:45:04.260 --> 00:45:05.910
and he's a freshman
at Wesley now.

00:45:05.910 --> 00:45:07.650
And he says,
Professor, please tell

00:45:07.650 --> 00:45:10.080
Google that its definition
of Asian Americans

00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:12.510
as being chiefly East
Asian is inaccurate.

00:45:12.510 --> 00:45:15.282
If you guys look up Asian
American definition in Google,

00:45:15.282 --> 00:45:17.490
it uses something, I don't
know from what dictionary,

00:45:17.490 --> 00:45:18.485
but it says--

00:45:18.485 --> 00:45:20.110
actually, I'll read
this out right now.

00:45:20.110 --> 00:45:22.680
And it says, "an American
who is of Asian--"

00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:26.800
and then in parentheses
"(chiefly East Asian) descent."

00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:31.230
This is important because if you
look at the demographic data,

00:45:31.230 --> 00:45:34.650
less than 40% of Asian American
population now is East Asian.

00:45:34.650 --> 00:45:38.400
The reason I bring this up is
that our model minority myth

00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:42.570
but also in our notion of who is
Asian is kind of frozen in time

00:45:42.570 --> 00:45:45.070
and very, very stereotypical.

00:45:45.070 --> 00:45:48.420
And it-- it hurts us.

00:45:48.420 --> 00:45:50.310
Even though we think it
might be a compliment

00:45:50.310 --> 00:45:52.500
to be seen as good
in math and science,

00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:55.050
it means that people
who have creative talent

00:45:55.050 --> 00:45:57.820
are less likely to have
that talent recognized.

00:45:57.820 --> 00:45:59.550
And so, I think
what can be done--

00:45:59.550 --> 00:46:02.100
part of it is changing
even the stories

00:46:02.100 --> 00:46:04.380
we tell ourselves
as Asian Americans,

00:46:04.380 --> 00:46:08.580
but also continuingly
showing our complexity

00:46:08.580 --> 00:46:12.960
and not shying away from showing
those parts of ourselves that

00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:14.877
are not in line with
that model minority myth.

00:46:14.877 --> 00:46:16.793
I don't know, Jennifer
if you have something--

00:46:16.793 --> 00:46:19.460
JENNIFER LEE: I would say one
other thing is that Karthick

00:46:19.460 --> 00:46:23.130
and I wrote about when--

00:46:23.130 --> 00:46:26.220
there was a shooting
of Kuchibhotla,

00:46:26.220 --> 00:46:27.960
one of the things
we both noticed

00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:30.990
was that there wasn't the
outcry among Asian Americans

00:46:30.990 --> 00:46:32.850
as there was with Vincent Chin.

00:46:32.850 --> 00:46:36.600
And Vincent Chin's, his
murder was 35 years ago.

00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:39.750
And still, every
year that comes up.

00:46:39.750 --> 00:46:43.650
And that becomes heralded as
an issue that in some ways

00:46:43.650 --> 00:46:45.330
unifies us.

00:46:45.330 --> 00:46:47.730
That didn't happen
most recently.

00:46:47.730 --> 00:46:49.350
And it hasn't been
happening when

00:46:49.350 --> 00:46:51.750
it comes to South Asians
who are experiencing--

00:46:51.750 --> 00:46:53.340
who are much more
likely to experience

00:46:53.340 --> 00:46:55.560
hate crimes and discrimination.

00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:59.070
And here I would think that
we are much stronger when

00:46:59.070 --> 00:47:01.110
we unify across ethnic groups.

00:47:01.110 --> 00:47:04.410
We experience similar
types of discrimination.

00:47:04.410 --> 00:47:06.180
And how much more
powerful we can

00:47:06.180 --> 00:47:10.680
be if we decide, at
least among ourselves

00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:16.200
and also collectively, show a
stronger collective unifying

00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:20.160
identity that Asian American
includes not only East Asian,

00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:23.490
but also South Asian who are
demographically, actually,

00:47:23.490 --> 00:47:25.600
becoming a larger
part of our population

00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:26.580
as Karthick mentioned.

00:47:26.580 --> 00:47:28.310
KARTHICK RAMAKRISHNAN: Yeah,
one quick thing, if I may, Amy.

00:47:28.310 --> 00:47:29.430
It's just a--

00:47:29.430 --> 00:47:33.960
February, 2018, let's see what
Google, other Silicon Valley

00:47:33.960 --> 00:47:36.390
companies, and Asian Americans
throughout the country

00:47:36.390 --> 00:47:38.740
can do to commemorate
that anniversary.

00:47:38.740 --> 00:47:41.280
Because the effects of
that still reverberate.

00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:44.880
So his widow had--
her visa status

00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:49.480
was in jeopardy because her
sponsorship had "expired"

00:47:49.480 --> 00:47:50.860
with her husband's death, right?

00:47:50.860 --> 00:47:52.150
So we need to--

00:47:52.150 --> 00:47:54.250
this stuff is so powerful.

00:47:54.250 --> 00:47:57.580
And the fact that we are not
rising up and speaking up

00:47:57.580 --> 00:47:59.950
actually makes it more
likely that policies

00:47:59.950 --> 00:48:03.494
will get passed that
disadvantage our communities.

00:48:03.494 --> 00:48:05.660
SPEAKER 1: I really appreciate
the themes coming out

00:48:05.660 --> 00:48:08.560
of you sharing around
community and coming together

00:48:08.560 --> 00:48:09.539
as a community.

00:48:09.539 --> 00:48:11.080
But, you know, what
we're also seeing

00:48:11.080 --> 00:48:14.485
are some very real nuances
in the data around opinions

00:48:14.485 --> 00:48:15.610
of different ethnic groups.

00:48:15.610 --> 00:48:18.370
So I'm curious around
your thoughts and ideas

00:48:18.370 --> 00:48:20.020
for, you know, how
do we move forward

00:48:20.020 --> 00:48:23.770
as a collective community, you
know, recognizing, as well,

00:48:23.770 --> 00:48:24.853
the diversity that exists.

00:48:24.853 --> 00:48:26.329
Like, the vast diversity.

00:48:26.329 --> 00:48:27.870
KARTHICK RAMAKRISHNAN:
So I'll start,

00:48:27.870 --> 00:48:28.350
and then, Jennifer, you can--

00:48:28.350 --> 00:48:29.080
JENNIFER LEE: Yeah, you start.

00:48:29.080 --> 00:48:30.830
KARTHICK RAMAKRISHNAN:
So one of the-- you

00:48:30.830 --> 00:48:33.172
know, people who are not
Asian kind of get confused.

00:48:33.172 --> 00:48:35.380
You're like, wait, you say
that you're-- you say that

00:48:35.380 --> 00:48:37.174
you're Asian, but
then you also say,

00:48:37.174 --> 00:48:39.340
we're very different and
don't lump us all together.

00:48:39.340 --> 00:48:40.720
And it's like, it's hard.

00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:44.110
How can you be one and
many at the same time?

00:48:44.110 --> 00:48:47.500
And the academics in us
would say, it's complicated,

00:48:47.500 --> 00:48:48.820
but we can't say that, right?

00:48:48.820 --> 00:48:51.410
So part of it is contextual.

00:48:51.410 --> 00:48:54.580
So, yes, there are vast
socioeconomic differences.

00:48:54.580 --> 00:48:56.980
But when it comes
to public opinion,

00:48:56.980 --> 00:48:58.750
on a bunch of
public opinion data,

00:48:58.750 --> 00:49:01.240
Asian Americans-- so, for
example, on the Affordable Care

00:49:01.240 --> 00:49:04.390
Act, on universal health
care, on the Muslim ban,

00:49:04.390 --> 00:49:07.480
and a bunch of other issues,
are actually pretty unified.

00:49:07.480 --> 00:49:10.600
So just because-- so data
disaggregation does not

00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:12.820
mean that these groups
will never come together

00:49:12.820 --> 00:49:15.700
on anything, but it's
only when you disaggregate

00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:17.320
the data is you
can tell what are

00:49:17.320 --> 00:49:19.510
the circumstances under
which this group is very

00:49:19.510 --> 00:49:22.240
different from each other,
what are the circumstances

00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:23.860
under which they're unified?

00:49:23.860 --> 00:49:26.290
So we need to have an
evidence based approach

00:49:26.290 --> 00:49:28.450
to this question, and
not something that's

00:49:28.450 --> 00:49:30.442
just based on stereotyping.

00:49:30.442 --> 00:49:32.650
JENNIFER LEE: I would also
say one other thing, which

00:49:32.650 --> 00:49:34.930
is that if we look at
the Latino community,

00:49:34.930 --> 00:49:38.200
there is enormous
diversity among Latinos.

00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:40.930
There are Cubans,
there are Mexicans,

00:49:40.930 --> 00:49:42.790
there are Guatemalans,
Salvadorans,

00:49:42.790 --> 00:49:47.200
enormously different achievement
outcomes, enormously different

00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:48.670
migration experiences.

00:49:48.670 --> 00:49:53.350
Yet, as Latinos, they are
a powerful political force.

00:49:53.350 --> 00:49:55.630
And so that's what,
I think, we're

00:49:55.630 --> 00:49:57.200
missing as Asian Americans.

00:49:57.200 --> 00:50:01.390
We-- just because
we identify as Asian

00:50:01.390 --> 00:50:03.430
and we take an
inclusive approach,

00:50:03.430 --> 00:50:06.190
does not mean that we
deny our ethnic origins,

00:50:06.190 --> 00:50:09.580
or national origins,
but the power

00:50:09.580 --> 00:50:11.590
that we have as
Asian Americans is

00:50:11.590 --> 00:50:13.530
much stronger as a collective.

00:50:13.530 --> 00:50:17.455
Just as Latino is much
stronger than Cuban.

00:50:17.455 --> 00:50:18.330
SPEAKER 1: Thank you.

00:50:18.330 --> 00:50:19.960
And I believe we
have a live question.

00:50:19.960 --> 00:50:20.751
AUDIENCE: Yeah, hi.

00:50:20.751 --> 00:50:22.030
Thank you for the talk.

00:50:22.030 --> 00:50:25.080
I was just really curious
about the sample size

00:50:25.080 --> 00:50:27.480
that you collected
to gather this data?

00:50:27.480 --> 00:50:30.000
And how did you decide on the
questions that were prompted?

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:34.110
Like, if you were
bullied, which are you

00:50:34.110 --> 00:50:36.357
leaning more towards,
Republican or a Democrat?

00:50:36.357 --> 00:50:38.190
And all of the questions
that you mentioned.

00:50:38.190 --> 00:50:40.380
So I'm just really curious with
the methodology a little bit

00:50:40.380 --> 00:50:41.010
more.

00:50:41.010 --> 00:50:42.385
KARTHICK RAMAKRISHNAN:
Excellent.

00:50:42.385 --> 00:50:43.380
Yeah, so this is--

00:50:43.380 --> 00:50:46.410
so the-- I think the overall
sample is little over 4,000

00:50:46.410 --> 00:50:47.900
for Asian Americans.

00:50:47.900 --> 00:50:49.330
JENNIFER LEE: I think 4,300.

00:50:49.330 --> 00:50:49.910
KARTHICK RAMAKRISHNAN: 4,300.

00:50:49.910 --> 00:50:50.130
There you go.

00:50:50.130 --> 00:50:50.880
JENNIFER LEE: Yes.

00:50:50.880 --> 00:50:53.430
KARTHICK RAMAKRISHNAN: We
tried to get at least 300

00:50:53.430 --> 00:50:56.970
per group, just in terms
of the statistical power

00:50:56.970 --> 00:50:58.980
that we need for most of
the kind of differences

00:50:58.980 --> 00:51:00.090
that we see.

00:51:00.090 --> 00:51:02.430
In terms of the
questions, it's layered.

00:51:02.430 --> 00:51:03.960
Some of it is
repeating questions

00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:08.280
that show up in other major
National Science funded

00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:10.620
surveys, like the American
National Election Study

00:51:10.620 --> 00:51:12.330
and the General Social Survey.

00:51:12.330 --> 00:51:14.130
Some of it is also
questions that we've

00:51:14.130 --> 00:51:16.380
asked in the past
based on conversations

00:51:16.380 --> 00:51:18.600
with community organizations.

00:51:18.600 --> 00:51:20.040
So the question
about bullying is

00:51:20.040 --> 00:51:22.414
part of this larger set of
questions about the challenges

00:51:22.414 --> 00:51:25.455
that people face for
themselves and their families.

00:51:25.455 --> 00:51:27.330
And so we're repeated
some of those questions

00:51:27.330 --> 00:51:29.229
to track it over time.

00:51:29.229 --> 00:51:30.020
JENNIFER LEE: Yeah.

00:51:30.020 --> 00:51:31.645
And I would say that
what's interesting

00:51:31.645 --> 00:51:33.450
is that when you have
four people, four

00:51:33.450 --> 00:51:36.510
principal investigators,
we all have-- we

00:51:36.510 --> 00:51:38.160
come with different interests.

00:51:38.160 --> 00:51:41.160
And the three of them are
actually political scientists

00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:42.250
and I'm a sociologist.

00:51:42.250 --> 00:51:45.410
And maybe that doesn't make
a huge difference to you,

00:51:45.410 --> 00:51:47.850
but we have very
different ideas of what

00:51:47.850 --> 00:51:49.020
are important questions.

00:51:49.020 --> 00:51:51.510
And like Karthick
said, part of NAAS

00:51:51.510 --> 00:51:54.570
was to fill the
substantive void.

00:51:54.570 --> 00:51:56.880
People were not surveying
Asian Americans.

00:51:56.880 --> 00:51:59.620
And so we had no idea
how Asian Americans

00:51:59.620 --> 00:52:01.120
stood on certain issues.

00:52:01.120 --> 00:52:04.500
So some of that is
just the questions

00:52:04.500 --> 00:52:06.090
that were asked of
other Americans,

00:52:06.090 --> 00:52:07.680
but were not asked
of Asian Americans.

00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:10.170
And then other
questions were built

00:52:10.170 --> 00:52:13.230
thinking about the unique
experiences and challenges

00:52:13.230 --> 00:52:15.050
of Asian Americans.

00:52:15.050 --> 00:52:16.216
KARTHICK RAMAKRISHNAN: Yeah.

00:52:16.216 --> 00:52:18.930
One thing I'll say, by the way,
is not only in this survey,

00:52:18.930 --> 00:52:21.540
but in prior surveys,
both that NAAS

00:52:21.540 --> 00:52:24.090
has done but also
AAPI Data has done,

00:52:24.090 --> 00:52:25.350
we've uncovered other issues.

00:52:25.350 --> 00:52:26.684
Environmentalism is one of them.

00:52:26.684 --> 00:52:28.766
Most people when they think
about environmentalist

00:52:28.766 --> 00:52:30.810
don't think of Asian
Americans, but we actually

00:52:30.810 --> 00:52:33.450
index much higher
than US average

00:52:33.450 --> 00:52:35.670
when it comes to
pro-environment attitudes.

00:52:35.670 --> 00:52:36.290
Gun control.

00:52:36.290 --> 00:52:38.130
We have some of the
strongest attitudes that

00:52:38.130 --> 00:52:40.882
are pro-gun control, but
Asian Americans rarely

00:52:40.882 --> 00:52:41.590
get talked about.

00:52:41.590 --> 00:52:42.840
Like, after Vegas,
how many people

00:52:42.840 --> 00:52:45.060
were asking, where do Asian
Americans stand, right?

00:52:45.060 --> 00:52:46.530
But the fact that
we have this data

00:52:46.530 --> 00:52:49.350
hopefully can help
change that narrative so

00:52:49.350 --> 00:52:51.780
that we are written into the
stories of what Americans

00:52:51.780 --> 00:52:56.616
think about gun violence
and gun control.

00:52:56.616 --> 00:52:58.240
SPEAKER 1: Thank you
for that question.

00:52:58.240 --> 00:53:01.030
I'd love to hear if there are
notable differences, talking

00:53:01.030 --> 00:53:03.700
about survey data, between
the first generation

00:53:03.700 --> 00:53:06.170
and second generation that
emerged from the NAAS data?

00:53:06.170 --> 00:53:07.660
If you saw any patterns there?

00:53:07.660 --> 00:53:09.550
You know, do young
Asian American adults

00:53:09.550 --> 00:53:11.380
differ in their views
on policy issues,

00:53:11.380 --> 00:53:14.340
than say, you know, compared
to older Asian American adults.

00:53:14.340 --> 00:53:16.340
JENNIFER LEE: Actually
I'll start off with that.

00:53:16.340 --> 00:53:18.881
I think-- I'm so glad you asked
that question because we have

00:53:18.881 --> 00:53:21.310
so much more data than
we're able to present

00:53:21.310 --> 00:53:22.580
in this short period.

00:53:22.580 --> 00:53:24.190
And if you're
interested, you can

00:53:24.190 --> 00:53:27.190
look at the link
that's listed below.

00:53:27.190 --> 00:53:29.080
One of the most
interesting things

00:53:29.080 --> 00:53:32.950
is that if you break down the
data by generational status,

00:53:32.950 --> 00:53:35.810
so first generation, meaning
born in a different country,

00:53:35.810 --> 00:53:38.050
second generation, born here.

00:53:38.050 --> 00:53:41.320
And also if you break
it down by age, so 25

00:53:41.320 --> 00:53:45.430
and under versus 25 and up,
the younger second generation

00:53:45.430 --> 00:53:48.760
are incredibly more progressive
on all of these issues.

00:53:48.760 --> 00:53:52.180
So Asian Americans are much
more progressive on all

00:53:52.180 --> 00:53:54.700
of the issues that
we discussed, which

00:53:54.700 --> 00:53:57.430
is oftentimes a misperception.

00:53:57.430 --> 00:54:00.190
But if you look at
the 25 and under,

00:54:00.190 --> 00:54:02.470
and if you look at
the second generation,

00:54:02.470 --> 00:54:04.450
they're actually
even more progressive

00:54:04.450 --> 00:54:05.590
about the Muslim ban.

00:54:05.590 --> 00:54:07.570
They oppose it more strongly.

00:54:07.570 --> 00:54:10.750
They're more likely to support
a pathway to citizenship.

00:54:10.750 --> 00:54:16.750
They're more likely to support
climate control, gun control,

00:54:16.750 --> 00:54:18.050
all of the issues.

00:54:18.050 --> 00:54:20.620
It's really actually quite--

00:54:20.620 --> 00:54:23.620
it feeds me with a sense
of optimism about where

00:54:23.620 --> 00:54:25.750
we're going as a community.

00:54:25.750 --> 00:54:28.083
KARTHICK RAMAKRISHNAN: Yeah,
the one caveat I would say,

00:54:28.083 --> 00:54:30.150
though, is when it
comes to participation--

00:54:30.150 --> 00:54:30.480
JENNIFER LEE: Yes.

00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:32.130
KARTHICK RAMAKRISHNAN: --so all
you Asian American millennials

00:54:32.130 --> 00:54:32.700
in the room--

00:54:32.700 --> 00:54:32.920
JENNIFER LEE: Yes.

00:54:32.920 --> 00:54:34.420
KARTHICK RAMAKRISHNAN:
--and online,

00:54:34.420 --> 00:54:35.930
we need to step up
our game, right?

00:54:35.930 --> 00:54:35.973
JENNIFER LEE: Yes.

00:54:35.973 --> 00:54:37.847
KARTHICK RAMAKRISHNAN:
'Cause it used to be--

00:54:37.847 --> 00:54:39.630
so when we were
looking at this puzzle,

00:54:39.630 --> 00:54:41.460
Asian Americans
on average tending

00:54:41.460 --> 00:54:44.430
to have among the highest levels
of educational attainment,

00:54:44.430 --> 00:54:47.020
but the lowest levels of
political participation.

00:54:47.020 --> 00:54:48.154
That's a huge puzzle.

00:54:48.154 --> 00:54:50.070
The political science
and sociology literature

00:54:50.070 --> 00:54:51.330
would not predict that.

00:54:51.330 --> 00:54:52.620
So what accounts for that?

00:54:52.620 --> 00:54:55.200
Generally we found
immigration related factors.

00:54:55.200 --> 00:54:58.440
Turns out that most people got
their college degrees in Asia.

00:54:58.440 --> 00:55:01.580
They were not socialized into
politics in the same way.

00:55:01.580 --> 00:55:03.256
They don't understand
the party system.

00:55:03.256 --> 00:55:04.630
They don't understand
the issues.

00:55:04.630 --> 00:55:06.270
They're not as engaged.

00:55:06.270 --> 00:55:08.670
So that should mean that
the people born here,

00:55:08.670 --> 00:55:11.525
who went to college
here, who are progressive

00:55:11.525 --> 00:55:13.150
in all of these-- or
even maybe they're

00:55:13.150 --> 00:55:15.733
conservative on a bunch-- they
have strong opinions on issues,

00:55:15.733 --> 00:55:16.930
they should be engaged.

00:55:16.930 --> 00:55:19.150
And again, Asian
American millennials,

00:55:19.150 --> 00:55:21.760
Asian American native
born have among the lowest

00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:25.030
rates of political and
civic participation.

00:55:25.030 --> 00:55:26.770
That really concerns me.

00:55:26.770 --> 00:55:28.870
If we think about what--
especially in a state

00:55:28.870 --> 00:55:29.630
like California.

00:55:29.630 --> 00:55:31.660
If you look at the
future of California,

00:55:31.660 --> 00:55:35.780
and especially its professional
upper middle class population,

00:55:35.780 --> 00:55:38.230
it's more and more going
to be Asian American.

00:55:38.230 --> 00:55:42.010
What are we doing to hold up
our end of the civic commitment

00:55:42.010 --> 00:55:44.740
to the state of California, to
the neighborhoods we live in,

00:55:44.740 --> 00:55:45.744
and to our country?

00:55:45.744 --> 00:55:46.910
I think it's a big question.

00:55:46.910 --> 00:55:47.929
It's a big challenge.

00:55:47.929 --> 00:55:49.720
And it's something
hopefully that all of us

00:55:49.720 --> 00:55:52.870
can have a role in helping
to shape the future.

00:55:52.870 --> 00:55:55.000
SPEAKER 1: I certainly hope so.

00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:56.734
So we'll take one
more live question.

00:55:56.734 --> 00:55:58.900
And then I want to be
respectful of everyone's time.

00:55:58.900 --> 00:56:00.080
So I know we're a
couple minutes over,

00:56:00.080 --> 00:56:02.110
but I want to give space
for this one last question.

00:56:02.110 --> 00:56:02.740
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:56:02.740 --> 00:56:04.570
Thank you both for
coming today and sharing

00:56:04.570 --> 00:56:06.550
all of this illuminating
information.

00:56:06.550 --> 00:56:09.216
Related to the last
question, instead

00:56:09.216 --> 00:56:10.840
of just being
participants in terms of,

00:56:10.840 --> 00:56:12.756
like, accepting this
information and, kind of,

00:56:12.756 --> 00:56:15.130
letting it sink in, what
are two or three actions

00:56:15.130 --> 00:56:17.890
that we can take to all
be part of that change

00:56:17.890 --> 00:56:19.750
that you've mentioned today?

00:56:19.750 --> 00:56:20.545
KARTHICK RAMAKRISHNAN:
Well, I'll start.

00:56:20.545 --> 00:56:20.980
JENNIFER LEE: Go
for it, Karthick.

00:56:20.980 --> 00:56:21.340
Yeah.

00:56:21.340 --> 00:56:21.400
KARTHICK RAMAKRISHNAN: Yeah.

00:56:21.400 --> 00:56:23.720
I mean, I-- this is hard work.

00:56:23.720 --> 00:56:27.327
I mean, so we tried working
with different community

00:56:27.327 --> 00:56:29.660
organizations through the
country to say, you know what?

00:56:29.660 --> 00:56:33.210
Asian Americans are-- especially
on something like immigration,

00:56:33.210 --> 00:56:36.180
not just on DACA and Dreamers,
but with the proposed

00:56:36.180 --> 00:56:39.330
cuts to legal immigration that
the president just announced,

00:56:39.330 --> 00:56:40.830
we should be up in arms.

00:56:40.830 --> 00:56:43.140
We are so heavily
engaged in digital media,

00:56:43.140 --> 00:56:46.380
we should be flooding
Twitter, Facebook, Instagram,

00:56:46.380 --> 00:56:49.320
and Snapchat with what we think.

00:56:49.320 --> 00:56:51.120
Many of us would not
be in this country

00:56:51.120 --> 00:56:53.286
given the new kind of
qualifications they're talking

00:56:53.286 --> 00:56:54.750
about under the RAISE Act.

00:56:54.750 --> 00:56:56.280
So one of the
simple things we can

00:56:56.280 --> 00:57:00.610
do-- so we had come up with
this hashtag called #AAPIaction.

00:57:00.610 --> 00:57:03.660
And I would humbly suggest that
maybe not-- maybe that hashtag,

00:57:03.660 --> 00:57:05.310
maybe something
else, but lets start

00:57:05.310 --> 00:57:07.060
getting organized
digitally, because we're

00:57:07.060 --> 00:57:09.760
so heavily indexed in terms
of digital participation.

00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:13.870
But lets go beyond consumption
of, like, our YouTube stars,

00:57:13.870 --> 00:57:16.050
and, like, questions
about who we are.

00:57:16.050 --> 00:57:18.400
Like, these identity
questions are important,

00:57:18.400 --> 00:57:21.402
but we have to be engaged
in digital and social media.

00:57:21.402 --> 00:57:22.735
So that one easy thing I'll say.

00:57:22.735 --> 00:57:22.780
Yeah.

00:57:22.780 --> 00:57:24.488
JENNIFER LEE: Can I
interject right here?

00:57:24.488 --> 00:57:26.470
I think one of the
things is you may

00:57:26.470 --> 00:57:30.770
have seen a lot of hashtags
about Hollywood is so white.

00:57:30.770 --> 00:57:34.690
And we are up in arms
about the lack of diversity

00:57:34.690 --> 00:57:37.240
in Hollywood, in movies, and TV.

00:57:37.240 --> 00:57:40.140
The lack of Asian
American representation.

00:57:40.140 --> 00:57:44.770
If we could channel that energy
to some political causes,

00:57:44.770 --> 00:57:47.650
as you mentioned, how
much stronger would we be?

00:57:47.650 --> 00:57:49.852
How much more seriously
would we be taken?

00:57:49.852 --> 00:57:52.060
KARTHICK RAMAKRISHNAN: And
the last thing I would say

00:57:52.060 --> 00:57:54.820
is let's see what we can
do on February, 2018.

00:57:54.820 --> 00:57:56.170
I'm serious here.

00:57:56.170 --> 00:57:59.170
That would be a good--
and we have several months

00:57:59.170 --> 00:58:01.040
of lead time, right?

00:58:01.040 --> 00:58:02.780
This is the anni--
one year anniversary

00:58:02.780 --> 00:58:04.700
of Srinivas
Kuchibhotla's murder.

00:58:04.700 --> 00:58:06.350
It was also the one
year anniversary

00:58:06.350 --> 00:58:09.590
of the gentleman who helped
save his life, right?

00:58:09.590 --> 00:58:13.760
So it also shows you the power
of cross-racial coalitions

00:58:13.760 --> 00:58:15.630
and standing up for each other.

00:58:15.630 --> 00:58:17.150
Let's see what we
can do, because I

00:58:17.150 --> 00:58:20.090
think that will be
a good test of-- we

00:58:20.090 --> 00:58:21.980
have enough lead
time to organize.

00:58:21.980 --> 00:58:24.009
This is someone who
was an engineer,

00:58:24.009 --> 00:58:25.550
so that should be
a cause that should

00:58:25.550 --> 00:58:29.360
be near and dear to the heart
of engineers everywhere, right?

00:58:29.360 --> 00:58:30.790
But even beyond engineers.

00:58:30.790 --> 00:58:34.220
And this is something that all
the AAPIs should rally around,

00:58:34.220 --> 00:58:37.400
because it shows you the power
of anti-immigrant rhetoric,

00:58:37.400 --> 00:58:42.230
racist rhetoric, and nativism,
and how it can affect all of us

00:58:42.230 --> 00:58:43.590
in very dangerous ways.

00:58:43.590 --> 00:58:46.010
And it's important for us
to, not only commemorate,

00:58:46.010 --> 00:58:48.680
but to make sure that things
like this don't happen again.

00:58:48.680 --> 00:58:52.300
So I'll leave it at that,
as one potential test

00:58:52.300 --> 00:58:56.570
to what our power could be,
both in terms of online activism

00:58:56.570 --> 00:58:57.825
as well as offline.

00:58:57.825 --> 00:58:59.400
SPEAKER 1: Well,
thank you so much,

00:58:59.400 --> 00:59:02.480
both of you, for being here,
and thank you all for coming.

00:59:02.480 --> 00:59:04.740
I appreciate your
attendance and engagement.

00:59:04.740 --> 00:59:05.532
And thank you both.

00:59:05.532 --> 00:59:06.739
JENNIFER LEE: Thank you, Amy.

00:59:06.800 --> 00:59:08.675
KARTHICK RAMAKRISHNAN:
Good night, take care.

00:59:08.675 --> 00:59:10.150
[APPLAUSE]
