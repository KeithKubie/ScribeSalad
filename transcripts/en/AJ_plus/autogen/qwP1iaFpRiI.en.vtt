00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.360
Definitely don't make it about yourself.

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.880
A lot of people will say, "Oh, well, you're sad."

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.160
"Well, you know, it could be so much worse,"

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.560
or "Everybody deals with hard times."

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.560
It's not a choice. Nobody wants to experience these things.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:30.040
Nobody wants to go through them.

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.840
Definitely say, "I'm here for you.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.440
Please let me know how I can be a support to you in any way that I can."

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.400
Recognize that every person is going through something that you can't

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.760
necessarily understand.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.640
If you see something on social media where someone doesn't seem to be one hundred

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:55.440
percent well, check in with that. Simply by saying "Hey, how's it going?"

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.080
And letting them know that you're there for them doesn't mean that you're trying to get

00:00:59.120 --> 00:00:59.720
in their business.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.280
I just would be happy if people listened, and were accepting, and non-judgmental,

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.080
you know. Just say, "I'm here for you. If you want to talk, talk. If you don't want to talk,

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.440
we can just sit here and eat pizza.
