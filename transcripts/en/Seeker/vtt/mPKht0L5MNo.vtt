00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.345
Guys, have you ever looked at
your hands, and you're like,

00:00:03.345 --> 00:00:04.210
why do I have these?

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.260
Hey, peeps, this is D News.

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:13.093
Thanks for watching.

00:00:13.093 --> 00:00:14.680
Sometimes when
you're sitting around

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.290
in your friend's basement
and you're all zoned out,

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:20.630
and you look down at your heavy
limbs and you start pondering,

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.310
why do we have
four of these, man?

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.760
Bats got four, and monkeys and
lizards and frogs and birds

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.040
and drag-- you get the idea.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.540
I'm not saying
that's what happened.

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:31.790
But a team of scientists
from the University of Vienna

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:35.404
wanted to know exactly why
limbs always come in pairs,

00:00:35.404 --> 00:00:37.070
and published their
model in the journal

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:38.340
Evolution and Development.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.780
By the way, it has to
deal with our tummy.

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.040
I like to point out that
this is the hypothesis.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.780
The researchers have
created a model.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.170
And now that it's
published, other researchers

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:48.300
can begin to study it.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.842
They will pick it
apart for accuracy

00:00:49.842 --> 00:00:50.800
and tweak it over time.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.045
This is science in action.

00:00:52.045 --> 00:00:53.670
Of all the known
species on the planet,

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.600
both living and extinct, those
with both a backbone and a jaw

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.470
all have paired appendages .

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:02.460
Using information from molecular
embryology, paleontology,

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.650
and classical morphology,
the researchers

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.390
examined all these
jawed vertebrates

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.860
known as gnathostomes in
as basic a state as we can,

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.380
by looking at their
gene expression

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:12.744
and embryonic development.

00:01:12.744 --> 00:01:14.160
Their model explains
the reason we

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.250
have paired appendages
is because of the three

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.470
types of basic tissues
in a developing embryo.

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.030
The ectoderm becomes the
skin and nervous system,

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.470
the mesoderm, which forms
muscles, bones, and organs,

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.420
and the endoderm, which
forms the digestive tract.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.580
Usually the mesoderm
splits into two layers

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.750
to line the body
cavity and the gut.

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.320
And if those layers are
sufficiently separated,

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.540
they'll form into limbs
right below the gut.

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:38.050
Why?

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.310
Because the developing gut
keeps the layers nearby

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.680
too close together to
form those appendages.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.530
As the body forms, the
end of the digestive tract

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.470
fits between the legs,
and everything else

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.050
just kind of closes
up down there.

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.250
Above the gut, the mesoderm and
ectoderm are messing around.

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.550
And they form
another set of limbs

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.270
with the separated tissue.

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.130
Two sets of opposing
appendage pairs, all

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.460
because that digestive
tissue sits in the middle.

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.460
Thanks, belly.

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.470
If this works out, we'll
have a great theory

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.789
on why all the gnathostomes
have two pairs of limbs.

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.140
We'll have to wait and see
if the science pans out.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.580
Would you rather have more arms?

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.539
Maybe another set, like
down here or something?

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:15.038
Where?

00:02:15.038 --> 00:02:15.650
How?

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.691
Grab your keyboards and
head down to the comments

00:02:17.691 --> 00:02:19.370
to share your
[INAUDIBLE] dreams.

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.278
Thanks a lot for watching
D News, everybody.
