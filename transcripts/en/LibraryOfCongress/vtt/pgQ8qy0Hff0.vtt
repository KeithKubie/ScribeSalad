00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:18.300
Well I mean as, as you

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.160
I was born in Bogota Columbia.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.360
I have been in the States
for the last 27 years.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.980
And came with my brother here
you know with a dream of,

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.910
of continuing what
we were already doing

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:34.700
in Columbia, back in Columbia.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.910
Music. So it's been 27 years
as of you know studying,

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.040
going to school, learning a lot

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:48.160
about not only our own Columbian
music but also other music's

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.180
that we've done here so far.

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.720
So I've been in a lot of bands.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.660
I've been singing, playing
every kinds of and types

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.680
of music you know from
Mexican music to Peruvian music

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.020
to Salsa, Puerto Rican yeah to
everything and always trying

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.960
to maintain my Columbian music.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.940
Also when I arrived to the
States I, I, I, I was a singer

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.430
of [foreign language] you
know Africa -- I'm sorry.

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.450
Venezuelan and Columbian music.

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.130
And that's all I
knew how to sing.

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:22.430
And.

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:23.730
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy:
That's from the planes

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.030
that [foreign language].

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.330
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:27.630
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Planes
that, that overlaps both the.

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:28.930
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.230
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Venezuela.

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:31.530
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:32.830
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: And Columbia

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.130
&gt;&gt; It's a region that we share
with Venezuela and the music

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:35.930
that I, I concentrated most
of my life was from the,

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.230
from this region you know.

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.650
Although I'm from Bogota I learn
how to dance [foreign language]

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.520
since I was very young.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.830
And I learned how to play
some [foreign language].

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.670
And I learned how to sing
some [foreign language].

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.820
So I did that for, for a
long time until I arrived

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.610
to the States and then with such
a diversity of all this cultures

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.560
and all this mixture of
everything, I fell in love

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.290
with a lot of things but
also wanted to learn more

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.630
about my own country
believe it or not.

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.660
Is when you depart your
country is when you realize

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.500
that you know that maybe you
should have paid more attention

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.670
to your own music and styles
and regions and all that.

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.850
So that's when I met this guys
maybe another 18 years ago we

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.500
met through a band.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.400
And we were doing
some Columbian music

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.250
and you know they taught me
this music from the region

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.640
that they are because
I'm from, from Bogota.

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.320
They're from the
Caribbean the north coast.

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.250
So I've learned with this
guys all this music and I fell

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.510
in love and I loved
it as you know.

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.980
And since then we've
been you know part --

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.870
basically they've already had
that idea of revolu [phonetic].

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.390
And they show me really what to
do and, and I've been with them

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.760
for the last 10 years now.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.150
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: And
Ronald Cenetes [phonetic]

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:54.450

with cultural royalty.

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:11.600
Who've been recognized.

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:12.900
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:14.200
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: At a
world level here in terms

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:15.860
of the traditions
represented right here

00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:17.460
on these three chairs.

00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:20.350

honor to be with you.

00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:21.650

00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:22.950
Oh my God it's an
honor to be here.

00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:24.990
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: So let me ask
you, let's get, get into the --

00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:27.570
your music a little bit.

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:31.620
How, how does this background,
how did what you bring to this?

00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:34.420
Your family background your
[foreign language] background,

00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:37.780
you, your Columbia and, and
eager to learn all kinds

00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:39.080
of traditional background.

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:43.970
How does that come out in the
music of [foreign language]?

00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:45.560
&gt;&gt; I, I mean from
my part I'm going,

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:51.610
I'm going to say you know it
just really it just really

00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:54.350
represents you know our roots.

00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:55.830
This music that we do

00:10:55.830 --> 00:11:00.140
that definitely represents
a lot of what Columbia is.

00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:04.810
I mean if you see [foreign
language] we have different

00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:07.630
regions basically within
the same group you know.

00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:11.880
Not only that we also do
share this stage with also now

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:13.890
that we're in the States we
share the stage with people

00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:17.060
from other countries
too like from Mexico.

00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:20.880
We have some people from here
the States play Columbian music.

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:24.720
So it's, it's you know for us
it's a privilege to be able

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:28.330
to have other cultures
involved within our culture.

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:31.800
And that they're willing
to also learn and, and,

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:34.690
and take that step of,
of learning our culture,

00:11:34.690 --> 00:11:37.470
our rhythms and play
the music with us.

00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:41.210
So you know we express
definitely everything

00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:43.990
that we brought from Columbia.

00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:46.750
Again I mentioned before
that once you're away

00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:50.490
from your country is when
you're really want to learn more

00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:54.370
and start doing the research
of everything that Columbia has

00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:58.590
to offer because we want to be
the ones taking this message

00:11:58.590 --> 00:12:01.250
to the world of saying
this is what we have.

00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:02.720
This is the music that we have.

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:04.250
This is our instruments.

00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:07.410
This is the Afra-descendants
you know all this regions

00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:10.600
that we want to share
with you so.

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:13.380
You know that would
be from my, my side.

00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:17.030

[foreign language] you know.

And it's a I mean that one is
basically it maintains obviously

00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:53.800
a rhythm but it's also used
for a lot of improvisation.

00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:57.000

loudest one you know it's the

[foreign language] is the happy

drum because it's happy
the whole time you know

as it's always improvising.

00:24:06.430 --> 00:24:09.600
And then we move to
the [foreign language]

00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:13.040
which you some other countries
do share same [foreign language]

00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:14.730
you know maybe --

00:24:14.730 --> 00:24:17.930

the same way with sticks.

&gt;&gt; You play sideways.

00:24:27.030 --> 00:24:28.330
And it's, it's going to be
basically our base you know.

00:24:28.330 --> 00:24:29.630
It's going to do that base
sound you know on the music.

00:24:29.630 --> 00:24:33.320
And then usually this is smaller
version of that a very tiny one.

00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:36.870
It's called [foreign language]
you know which is usually the,

00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:41.060
the three instruments will
create the Afro-Columbian

calling a beat basically.

So [foreign language] is only
maintaining one beat the whole

00:24:51.930 --> 00:24:54.250
time throughout any
rhythms you know.

00:24:54.250 --> 00:24:56.780

[foreign language] you know

00:24:56.780 --> 00:24:59.670
which this is the
[foreign language]

00:24:59.670 --> 00:25:01.270
which is the female right?

00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:04.040

it would have only two,

two holes to cover.

00:25:08.290 --> 00:25:12.090
This one keeps the whole
melody throughout the songs.

00:25:12.090 --> 00:25:15.990
The other one will just
hold long notes throughout.

00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:17.290

with charcoal mixed in and
kind of mold into this head.

is a, a, duck feather so.

choice that we want

just to support our family.

when we really realize that we
should really be doing music

really enjoy and love doing.
