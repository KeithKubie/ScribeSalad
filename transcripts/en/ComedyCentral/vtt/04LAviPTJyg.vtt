00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:01.801
-I've eaten a ChapStick.
-Wow!

00:00:01.835 --> 00:00:04.170
I rolled up a whole ChapStick,
and went, "Neh," and-

00:00:04.203 --> 00:00:06.305
-How old were you?
-I was like 27.

00:00:06.338 --> 00:00:09.575
Oh, really? What the hell?
Why did you do that?

00:00:09.608 --> 00:00:12.678
I mean, so you just go
through phases, curiosity.

00:00:12.711 --> 00:00:13.880
Good for you.

00:00:13.913 --> 00:00:16.249
Yeah. I ate a Milk-Bone
not that long ago.

00:00:16.282 --> 00:00:17.583
Really?

00:00:17.616 --> 00:00:18.885
I was alone.

00:00:18.918 --> 00:00:21.921
I mean it was a weird choice,
but I had this idea

00:00:21.954 --> 00:00:25.058
that it could be
like a meat biscotti,

00:00:25.091 --> 00:00:26.492
like something
you'd eat with soup.

00:00:26.525 --> 00:00:27.693
It didn't work out.

00:00:27.726 --> 00:00:28.895
It didn't work. It was gross?

00:00:28.928 --> 00:00:30.196
No, not good.

00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:32.365
ChapStick and a Milk-Bone.
Sick.

00:00:35.134 --> 00:00:37.103
What's up, everybody?
Welcome to Stupid Questions.

00:00:37.136 --> 00:00:39.739
I'm Chris Distefano,
aka Chrissy Calamari.

00:00:39.772 --> 00:00:42.875
With me, Emmy Blotnick, and she
has got a half-hour special,

00:00:42.908 --> 00:00:44.110
it's on Comedy Central,

00:00:44.143 --> 00:00:46.379
which you knew that
because you're watching.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:49.715
E-Train, anyone
ever call you that?

00:00:49.748 --> 00:00:51.017
No, I like it.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:52.852
Oh, perfect. This is good.
We're on the E-Train,

00:00:52.885 --> 00:00:54.353
it's a good train,
it's a solid train.

00:00:58.124 --> 00:00:59.792 line:0%
I don't know how you say it
in dolphin,

00:00:59.825 --> 00:01:02.728 line:0%
but I'd wanna ask them
do you wish you had hair?

00:01:02.761 --> 00:01:04.063
Yeah.
Right?

00:01:04.096 --> 00:01:05.398
I wonder if dolphins
are ever like,

00:01:05.431 --> 00:01:07.133
"Oh, I just wish
I could flip around."

00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:09.702
My hair, that's true.
You know dolphins,

00:01:09.735 --> 00:01:11.804
one thing I learned about them
is they have sex for pleasure.

00:01:11.837 --> 00:01:13.039
A lot of animals
don't do that.

00:01:13.072 --> 00:01:14.273
They also rape each other.

00:01:14.306 --> 00:01:15.475
-That is true too.
-Yeah.

00:01:15.508 --> 00:01:17.276
What are you gonna do?
There's a dark side to dolphins.

00:01:17.309 --> 00:01:20.080
It's true, there are two sides
to every coin, dolphins.

00:01:22.414 --> 00:01:24.317 line:0%
If you could be a dog,
I could just press a button,

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.620 line:0%
and you'd turn into a dog, who
would you wanna like adopt you?

00:01:27.653 --> 00:01:31.224 line:0%
I'd wanna be probably like
medium-sized terrier,

00:01:31.257 --> 00:01:33.126 line:0%
and I would want The Rock
to adopt me.

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:34.494
That's awesome answer.

00:01:34.527 --> 00:01:36.596
Yeah, you want those big arms
you can feel safe in.

00:01:36.629 --> 00:01:38.297
What would I be?
I'd be a bulldog.

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:39.499
That feels right.

00:01:39.532 --> 00:01:40.800
Just because I've always
wanted to be British,

00:01:40.833 --> 00:01:41.734
so I'd feel like a British-

00:01:41.767 --> 00:01:42.869
Oh, you'd be an English
bulldog?

00:01:42.902 --> 00:01:43.669
I'd be an
English bulldog.

00:01:43.702 --> 00:01:44.904
-Okay.
-Specifically.

00:01:44.937 --> 00:01:47.073
I wanna be adopted
by like the queen.

00:01:47.106 --> 00:01:49.142
I'd wanna be like
a royal British bulldog.

00:01:49.175 --> 00:01:50.943
That's a beautiful answer.

00:01:50.976 --> 00:01:53.312
Because you know that
they've got royal staff

00:01:53.345 --> 00:01:56.349
to like clean the shit
out of your wrinkles.

00:01:56.882 --> 00:01:58.151
Get that swab in there.

00:01:58.184 --> 00:01:59.352
Yeah, my dumb fat face.

00:01:59.385 --> 00:02:01.121
Remove your crust.

00:02:05.558 --> 00:02:06.792 line:0%
Here's the plan-

00:02:06.825 --> 00:02:08.461
Anything you want Emmy,
you're gonna get.

00:02:08.494 --> 00:02:09.662
All right, all right, okay.

00:02:09.695 --> 00:02:10.863
Here's what we're doing.

00:02:10.896 --> 00:02:12.832
We're going to
the Metropolitan Museum,

00:02:12.865 --> 00:02:17.837
and we're taking all
the giant stone dickless men,

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.006
and we're gonna ...
I'll move it into my house.

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:22.141
It'll just be like
40 or 50-

00:02:22.174 --> 00:02:23.376
Dickless men.

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:24.610
... stone men with no dicks.

00:02:24.643 --> 00:02:25.878
And then would you wanna
put dicks on them,

00:02:25.911 --> 00:02:27.180
or are they just gonna
remain dickless?

00:02:27.213 --> 00:02:28.814
The dicks are
in a separate room,

00:02:28.847 --> 00:02:30.049
and that's how I feel powerful.

00:02:30.082 --> 00:02:31.284
Absolutely.

00:02:31.317 --> 00:02:33.186
You think when they
make you in stone,

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:35.621
is someone you wronged gonna
come and chop the dick off?

00:02:35.654 --> 00:02:36.822
Here's what I hope
doesn't happen.

00:02:36.855 --> 00:02:38.991
I hope when and if they do
make me in stone,

00:02:39.024 --> 00:02:40.826
they don't make me
with steroid dick,

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:43.296
because steroid dick
is a little dick.

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:44.864
But the butt is great, right?

00:02:44.897 --> 00:02:46.199
Oh my God, are you kidding me?

00:02:46.232 --> 00:02:47.800
From the back
it's gonna look unbelievable.

00:02:47.833 --> 00:02:49.001
That's how I like men.

00:02:49.034 --> 00:02:51.037
I like a little dick,
and a big fat ass.

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.339
There it is. Samesies.

00:03:04.583 --> 00:03:10.256
See I feel like the no TP
situation is like the reality.

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:11.557
That is just what happens.

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.392
You've been in that, we've
all been in that situation.

00:03:13.425 --> 00:03:15.228
Whereas I'd like to save
my good farts

00:03:15.261 --> 00:03:16.762
for my own wedding, you know?

00:03:16.795 --> 00:03:19.265
I feel like I wanna hold them in
until it's my day.

00:03:19.298 --> 00:03:20.866
Can you please 100%
invite me to your wedding

00:03:20.899 --> 00:03:22.101
if you plan on doing that?

00:03:22.134 --> 00:03:23.369
Yes.

00:03:23.402 --> 00:03:25.738
Literally, I'll pay for my own,
I'll pay for everything.

00:03:25.771 --> 00:03:27.006
I just wanna be there.

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:28.574
You've got it,
and if you've got a good one,

00:03:28.607 --> 00:03:29.775
you can do it there too.

00:03:29.808 --> 00:03:31.544
Because I'm holding
in a sick one.

00:03:32.745 --> 00:03:34.180
Yeah, if anyone says,
"Anyone object?"

00:03:34.213 --> 00:03:35.348
I'll just rip it.

00:03:35.381 --> 00:03:38.117
I'm gonna put it on the
registry, one giant fart,

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.286
but then it'll say that
it's been claimed already.

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:41.520
-Chrissy D.
-Yeah.

00:03:41.553 --> 00:03:42.555
Chrissy Colonoscopy.

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:45.558
-Did you have a good time-
-Yes.

00:03:45.591 --> 00:03:47.026
... on the show
Stupid Questions?

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:48.294
And you know
what I want to get you?

00:03:48.327 --> 00:03:49.562
A stupid gift now.

00:03:49.595 --> 00:03:51.564
I was inspired by your joke,
which I loved,

00:03:51.597 --> 00:03:53.366
and you guys loved,
the self potato bit.

00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:54.567
So look what I got you.

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:55.801
Oh.

00:03:55.834 --> 00:03:57.236
Look at that, your own
little self potato.

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:58.437
This is beautiful.

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:59.872
There you go,
it's got half a mouth.

00:03:59.905 --> 00:04:01.941
That's real human hair.
I took pieces of your hair

00:04:01.974 --> 00:04:03.609
when you were sleeping over
the course of the last year.

00:04:03.642 --> 00:04:07.079
There you go, and I made it,
so it's cute.

00:04:07.112 --> 00:04:08.281
I have a gift for you too.

00:04:08.314 --> 00:04:09.582
-You do?
-I do.

00:04:09.615 --> 00:04:10.783
Oh my God.

00:04:10.816 --> 00:04:12.151
Hold my daughter.

00:04:12.184 --> 00:04:14.153
I've never gotten a gift,
so this is exciting.

00:04:14.186 --> 00:04:16.555
Here's a little purple hair clip
so your daughter

00:04:16.588 --> 00:04:18.724
can put her hair back when she
talks shit about your cooking.

00:04:18.757 --> 00:04:19.925
Thank you.

00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:20.960
This is very beautiful.
