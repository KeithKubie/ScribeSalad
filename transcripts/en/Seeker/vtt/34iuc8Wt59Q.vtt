00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:05.640
Even though it’s 4,500 years old, the Great
Pyramid of Giza still has some secrets.

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.760
Recently we discovered a new one, and we did
it using subatomic particles from space.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.849
The particles in question are called Muons,
and they’re like relatives of electrons

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.659
if electrons really let themselves go; a muon
has about 200 times more mass than an electron.

00:00:20.659 --> 00:00:25.179
They’re generated when cosmic rays --usually
protons from stars-- collide with particles

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:26.269
in our upper atmosphere.

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:31.359
The newly formed muons rain down and about
10,000 hit every square meter of the earth’s

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:33.430
surface every minute.

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.520
You may have noticed, or not noticed rather,
that you’re not getting pummeled to death

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.630
by a particle shower all the time.

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.650
That’s because muons pass right through
stuff with ease.

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.760
It’s what tipped off 1930s quantum physicists
that what they were looking at wasn’t some

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.490
type of electron, but it’s own distinct
elementary particle.

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:54.280
Even though they can travel through the densest
materials, that doesn’t mean they’re unaffected

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.280
by them.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.390
Muons have a negative charge, meaning when
they come near electrons, their like charge

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.070
repels the muon, deflecting it and slowing
it down.

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.650
Since muons decay into electrons and neutrinos
after just 2 millionths of a second, really

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.060
dense materials can slow some muons down enough
to stop them, but many will still make it

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.079
through.

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:15.969
Scientists can use these properties to give
them x-ray vision.

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:20.229
Actually it’s better than x-ray vision,
because x-rays can be blocked by dense materials

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:23.060
while muons can come clean out the other side.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.630
Really Superman should have had muon vision,
instead of dumb old x-ray vision.

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.560
That’s right, I’m suggesting they nerfed
Superman.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.959
Anyway, scientists can use muons to see through
buildings using a technique called Muon Tomography.

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:39.439
Muons travel more slowly through materials
with higher atomic numbers, so by measuring

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:44.131
how muons from cosmic rays are deflected when
they pass though a big stone building, scientists

00:01:44.131 --> 00:01:46.469
can map out what they must have passed through.

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:50.619
And there’s no bigger or stonier building
than the Great Pyramid of Giza.

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:52.639
Well technically there is, but you get the
idea.

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:56.759
Plus since the pyramid is so dang old, it’d
be best to explore it in a way that doesn’t

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:57.759
harm it.

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:00.459
For that muon tomography is a perfect fit.

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:04.689
In December of 2015 researchers put a muon
detector inside the pyramid in what’s known

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:06.579
as the “Queen’s Chamber.”

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:11.070
Sure enough their results showed a heretofore
undiscovered void, and two separate teams

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.060
using different kinds of muon detectors in
different locations inside and outside the

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.120
pyramid confirmed the findings.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.590
The void is the first new discovery of a major
space inside the pyramid since the 19th century,

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.600
although scientists did try and use muon detectors
inside it back in the 1960s but the technology

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.390
was not as sensitive then as it is now.

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.930
Muon detectors have come a long way, especially
since September 11th, 2001, when fears of

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.490
a terrorist attack spurred research into technology
that could detect hidden nuclear weapons.

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:45.190
Today muon detectors can scan a 40 foot shipping
container in 45 seconds, revealing any nuclear

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:46.590
materials inside.

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.870
And there’s no use trying to hide a bomb
by shielding it with lead, because the muons

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.070
can go right through that too and the scanners
will just show that there’s a bomb AND some

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:56.070
lead.

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.620
As much as I’m glad that muon detectors
are helping to keep us safe, I just love that

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.900
some mad genius thought to use them in the
pyramids.

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.040
Where else are you going to find such an awesome
convergence of astronomy, particle physics,

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.040
and egyptology?

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.420
Besides Stargate, obviously.

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:11.420

Muon detectors have also been used at Fukushima
to map out where nuclear materials inside

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.630
the damaged reactors are.

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.909
That disaster is still ongoing, and we’ve
just found a new source of radiation.

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:39.360
