Another method for adding integers
involves using absolute value.

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:09.440
As long as all the numbers we're
adding have the same sign,

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:14.010
that is they're all positive or all
negative, we can just add the absolute

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:18.520
value of the numbers together and then
use the original sign of the numbers.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:23.310
For example, if we are adding
positive 3 and positive 2, both 3 and

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.970
2 have the same sign.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:31.080
The absolute value of 3 is 3,
and the absolute value of 2 is 2.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:37.690
So we can add the absolute value of 3
plus the absolute value of 2 to get 5.

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.390
And then use the original
sign that 3 and

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.320
2 both shared, which is positive,
and we get positive 5.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.650
Here's where things get interesting.

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.670
In the case where we're adding
negative 3 and negative 2, we can take

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.892
advantage of the fact that negative
3 and negative 2 share the same sign.

00:00:55.892 --> 00:00:58.070
They're both negative.

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.720
We can take the absolute
value of each number and

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.170
then add those absolute values.

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:08.430
So, what is the absolute value of
negative 3, and what about negative 2.

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.970
And what is the absolute
value of negative 3 plus

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.470
the absolute value of negative 2.

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.010
