00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.340
 Android Accessories 2.0 is released since 2014 

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:06.400
 The most important update for Android accessories 

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.970
 I am Hailin, I am here to introduce you. 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.140
 The most important three parts of Android Accessories 2.0 

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:14.800
 First, Android accessories used material design for the first time. 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.880
 The new Android accessory interface features a dark surface 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.040
 This makes the watch more integrated into the social environment. 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.350
 It also uses the [inaudible] display to save power 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:28.390
 We also recommend to developers 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.610
 Vertical layout and reverse orientation horizontal touch screen 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.290
 Swipe to end the event 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.710
 Our research shows that this enables the user interface 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.870
 Easier to understand 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.750
 In order to develop and implement these new style designs 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.540
 We introduced new user interface components 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.730
 For example: wearable interface design 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:48.160
 And a wearable loop 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.470
 Please visit the official website of Android accessories. 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:52.310
 Get more material design information 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:54.430
 The second major update to Android Accessories 2.0 is 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.530
 Watch dial involves level 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.100
 Before Android Accessories 2.0 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.470
 If the surface of the dial is to display data from other applications 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.440
 Whether at the negotiation or technical level 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.060
 Need a one-to-one agreement 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.790
 In order to improve the complexity of Android Accessories 2.0 in this regard 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.170
 We introduced an application interface to solve this problem. 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.880
 The problem involved is the traditional noun of making watches. 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.450
 For the message displayed on the surface of the dial 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.550
 In addition to displaying time, date or moon phase 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.130
 We extend this concept to smart watches. 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.960
 So any application can publish data for the surface consumption of the dial 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.060
 Surface energy of the dial 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.810
 Display this data in a unique design 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:38.960
 For application developers 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.970
 This helps increase user engagement and awareness 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.950
 For dial manufacturers this helps to improve usability 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.040
 Now users can choose any dial surface they want 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.070
 Get the data they need at the same time 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.520
 Please read the dial surface and related parts of the developer documentation. 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.700
 For more information 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.290
 Last but not least is the independence feature -- 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.990
 Previous Android App 1.0 related apps 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.780
 Need mobile applications to negotiate with cloud services 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.610
 Android accessories 2.0 wearable apps can now use the web directly 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.240
 And no longer need to install 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.010
 Corresponding Android phone app 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.220
 This means that the Android accessory app can access the Internet. 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.400
 Even if the user is using an Apple phone 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.380
 To help with application release 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.430
 We also installed the Google App Center on the watch. 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.540
 Now users can download apps directly on their wrists 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.730
 In addition to these three improvements 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.870
 Material design related aspects and independent applications 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.710
 Android accessories 2.0 and many others 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:46.551
 Aspects of improving performance 

00:02:46.551 --> 00:02:48.540
 Please visit the official website of Android Accessories Developers 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.930

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:53.600
