00:00:00.348 --> 00:00:02.043
- [Voiceover] Let's give
ourselves some practice

00:00:02.043 --> 00:00:04.899
substituting positive and negative values

00:00:04.899 --> 00:00:06.756
for variables.

00:00:06.756 --> 00:00:08.359
So we're told to evaluate X,

00:00:08.359 --> 00:00:12.561
we're told to evaluate X minus negative Y,

00:00:12.561 --> 00:00:15.905
where X is equal to negative two

00:00:15.905 --> 00:00:18.969
and Y is equal to five.

00:00:18.969 --> 00:00:20.618
So everywhere we see an X, we can replace

00:00:20.618 --> 00:00:21.849
with a negative two.

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:23.845
Everywhere we see a Y,
we replace with a five.

00:00:23.845 --> 00:00:25.820
So this is a Y right over here,

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.375
and then of course,

00:00:27.375 --> 00:00:29.210
and then of course

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.416
this is an X.

00:00:30.416 --> 00:00:31.229
Let's do that.

00:00:31.229 --> 00:00:34.016
So instead of that X,
let's write negative two.

00:00:34.016 --> 00:00:36.802
So we have negative two minus

00:00:36.802 --> 00:00:38.358
and then we have in the parentheses

00:00:38.358 --> 00:00:40.307
a negative Y.

00:00:40.307 --> 00:00:42.838
Y is equal to,

00:00:42.838 --> 00:00:44.906
Y is equal to five.

00:00:44.906 --> 00:00:47.135
Now what is this going to evaluate to?

00:00:47.135 --> 00:00:49.039
Well, this is the same thing as

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:50.687
negative two,

00:00:50.687 --> 00:00:53.240
now subtracting a negative five,

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.494
so all of this business here,

00:00:54.494 --> 00:00:55.610
subtracting a negative five,

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.700
that's the same thing as adding a five.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.393
So it's going to be
negative two plus five,

00:01:00.393 --> 00:01:02.320
which is equal to three.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.978
This is going to be equal to three.

00:01:05.826 --> 00:01:08.301
And there's several ways
to think about this.

00:01:08.301 --> 00:01:10.972
my brain thinks okay, I'm
starting at negative two.

00:01:10.972 --> 00:01:13.920
If I add two I get to zero and then

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.266
I would have to add another,

00:01:15.266 --> 00:01:16.868
and then I have to add another three

00:01:16.868 --> 00:01:18.634
so that gets me to three.

00:01:18.634 --> 00:01:20.213
You can even view this as,

00:01:20.213 --> 00:01:21.233
you can even view this,

00:01:21.233 --> 00:01:23.021
my brain kind of says negative two,

00:01:23.021 --> 00:01:24.741
well let's see, I have to add,

00:01:24.741 --> 00:01:27.364
i have to add two to get back to zero

00:01:27.364 --> 00:01:29.314
and then I have to add another three

00:01:29.314 --> 00:01:31.219
if I want to add a total of five.

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:33.772
So this is going to be zero plus three

00:01:33.772 --> 00:01:35.654
gets me to three.

00:01:35.654 --> 00:01:37.024
Another way to think about it,

00:01:37.024 --> 00:01:38.810
negative two plus five is the same thing

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.598
as five minus two.

00:01:41.598 --> 00:01:43.618
Five minus two,

00:01:43.618 --> 00:01:45.730
which is of course equal to three.

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:47.403
Or you could of course
draw it on a number line.

00:01:47.403 --> 00:01:48.703
And you would say if you
start at negative two

00:01:48.703 --> 00:01:50.536
and you take five steps to the right,

00:01:50.536 --> 00:01:52.511
you get to positive three.

00:01:52.511 --> 00:01:53.347
Let's do another one of these.

00:01:53.347 --> 00:01:55.645
This one's a little bit more,

00:01:55.645 --> 00:01:57.943
a little bit more complex.

00:01:57.943 --> 00:01:58.687
So let's see.

00:01:58.687 --> 00:02:01.218
We're told to evaluate
three minus negative six

00:02:01.218 --> 00:02:05.815
plus negative H plus negative four,

00:02:05.815 --> 00:02:08.740
where H is equal to negative seven.

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:09.831
Well there's two ways you could do it.

00:02:09.831 --> 00:02:11.875
I could just take the
negative seven and replace it,

00:02:11.875 --> 00:02:14.615
the H with that negative seven,

00:02:14.615 --> 00:02:17.982
or I could actually try to
simplify this expression first

00:02:17.982 --> 00:02:20.583
and then do the substitution for H.

00:02:20.583 --> 00:02:21.603
Let's actually do that.

00:02:21.603 --> 00:02:23.996
My brain feels like doing that.

00:02:23.996 --> 00:02:25.482
So this expression,

00:02:25.482 --> 00:02:29.289
I have the three, but instead
of subtracting a negative six,

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:30.637
instead of subtracting a negative six,

00:02:30.637 --> 00:02:32.831
that's gonna be the same
thing as just adding six.

00:02:33.436 --> 00:02:35.363
So three plus six.

00:02:35.363 --> 00:02:37.709
And adding a negative H,

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:39.660
adding a negative H,

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.958
adding a negative H, that's the same thing

00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:43.327
as just subtracting H.

00:02:43.327 --> 00:02:45.650
So three plus six minus H,

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.064
and then adding a negative four,

00:02:48.064 --> 00:02:49.969
adding a negative four,

00:02:49.969 --> 00:02:52.268
that's the same thing as subtracting four.

00:02:52.268 --> 00:02:55.216
That's the same thing as subtracting four.

00:02:55.216 --> 00:02:57.955
And now of course we can do this in any,

00:02:57.955 --> 00:03:00.534
you know, addition and subtraction we have

00:03:00.534 --> 00:03:03.227
we can change the order in which we do it.

00:03:03.227 --> 00:03:06.570
So let's do that just to
kind of simplify all of this.

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.475
So, actually first of all,

00:03:08.475 --> 00:03:10.402
I can figure out what three plus six is.

00:03:10.402 --> 00:03:12.421
Three plus six is equal to nine.

00:03:12.421 --> 00:03:15.648
And then I have this minus four here.

00:03:15.648 --> 00:03:18.644
So I could say nine minus four,

00:03:18.644 --> 00:03:21.106
actually I want to be careful
not to skip any steps.

00:03:21.106 --> 00:03:23.009
So three plus six,

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:26.376
three plus six, in a
color that you can see,

00:03:26.376 --> 00:03:28.536
so three plus six is nine.

00:03:28.536 --> 00:03:29.946
So that's nine

00:03:30.876 --> 00:03:33.608
minus H minus four,

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:35.817
minus four.

00:03:35.817 --> 00:03:39.020
Now I could change the order in which I do

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:40.970
this addition or subtraction, so

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.131
this is going to be the equivalent of

00:03:43.131 --> 00:03:45.283
nine minus four.

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:49.225
Nine minus four minus H,

00:03:49.924 --> 00:03:51.294
minus H.

00:03:51.294 --> 00:03:53.105
And I just did that so I can simplify

00:03:53.105 --> 00:03:55.381
and figure out what nine minus four is.

00:03:55.381 --> 00:03:57.308
Nine minus four, of course,

00:03:57.308 --> 00:03:59.142
let me do this in blue, navy blue.

00:03:59.142 --> 00:04:01.371
Nine minus four is five.

00:04:01.371 --> 00:04:03.624
So this whole thing
simplified to five minus H

00:04:03.624 --> 00:04:05.620
before I even did the substitution.

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.568
And now I can substitute
H with negative seven.

00:04:09.568 --> 00:04:11.774
So this is going to be equal to,

00:04:11.774 --> 00:04:13.619
this is going to be equal to,

00:04:14.814 --> 00:04:16.708
when I do the substitution,
I'll write it up here,

00:04:16.708 --> 00:04:19.565
it's going to be five minus,

00:04:19.565 --> 00:04:21.701
I'll do the minus in that magenta color,

00:04:21.701 --> 00:04:24.742
minus and now where I see an H,

00:04:24.742 --> 00:04:26.531
I'm gonna replace it with negative seven.

00:04:26.531 --> 00:04:28.319
Five minus negative seven.

00:04:28.319 --> 00:04:29.270
You want to be very careful there,

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:30.478
you might be tempted to say,

00:04:30.478 --> 00:04:31.963
oh I have a negative here, negative here,

00:04:31.963 --> 00:04:33.983
let me just replace H with a seven.

00:04:33.983 --> 00:04:37.559
Remember, H is negative seven,
so you're subtracting H.

00:04:37.559 --> 00:04:40.114
You're gonna subtract negative seven.

00:04:40.114 --> 00:04:42.343
So this is five minus negative seven,

00:04:42.343 --> 00:04:44.317
which is the same thing,

00:04:44.317 --> 00:04:47.666
which is the same thing
as five plus seven.

00:04:48.422 --> 00:04:50.826
Five plus seven,

00:04:50.826 --> 00:04:54.936
which we all know is equal to 12.

00:04:54.936 --> 00:04:56.376
And we're done.

00:04:56.376 --> 00:04:57.605
Let's do a few more of these.

00:04:57.605 --> 00:04:59.207
You can't really get enough practice here,

00:04:59.207 --> 00:05:01.670
this is some important foundational skills

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:04.270
for the rest of your mathematical lives.

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:05.477
(laughing) Alright.

00:05:05.477 --> 00:05:08.170
So consider, I don't make
you too stressed about it.

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:10.284
Consider the following number line.

00:05:10.284 --> 00:05:11.724
Alright, so we've got a number line here

00:05:11.724 --> 00:05:14.996
and let's see, they didn't
mark off all the numbers here.

00:05:14.996 --> 00:05:17.435
This is negative four, E is at this point,

00:05:17.435 --> 00:05:19.200
this is then we go to two.

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.638
So it looks like we're
counting by twos here,

00:05:21.638 --> 00:05:24.214
that this is negative
two, this is zero, yep.

00:05:24.214 --> 00:05:25.864
Negative four, if you increase by two,

00:05:25.864 --> 00:05:28.928
negative four, negative
two, zero, two, four,

00:05:28.928 --> 00:05:30.299
this would be a six.

00:05:30.299 --> 00:05:31.854
This would be a negative six.

00:05:31.854 --> 00:05:33.363
They intentionally left those numbers off,

00:05:33.363 --> 00:05:34.965
so we had to figure out that hey, look,

00:05:34.965 --> 00:05:37.078
between negative four and two,

00:05:37.078 --> 00:05:39.075
to go from negative four to two,

00:05:39.075 --> 00:05:40.515
you have to increase by six

00:05:40.515 --> 00:05:43.070
and we only have one,
two, three hashmarks.

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:45.856
So each of those hashmarks
must be increasing by two.

00:05:45.856 --> 00:05:47.342
Well anyway, now we know,

00:05:47.342 --> 00:05:48.712
now we know what all the points

00:05:48.712 --> 00:05:49.663
in the number line are.

00:05:49.663 --> 00:05:51.939
Evaluate E minus F.

00:05:51.939 --> 00:05:55.120
Well we know, we know that E

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.092
is equal to negative two.

00:05:58.092 --> 00:06:01.366
And we know, we know that F

00:06:01.366 --> 00:06:03.188
is equal to four.

00:06:03.944 --> 00:06:05.442
So this is going to be the same thing,

00:06:05.442 --> 00:06:08.988
E is equal to negative two minus,

00:06:09.803 --> 00:06:12.449
minus positive four.

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:14.888
Minus positive four.

00:06:14.888 --> 00:06:16.669
Let me do it in that same blue color.

00:06:17.507 --> 00:06:19.016
Minus four.

00:06:19.016 --> 00:06:21.268
Well negative two minus four,

00:06:21.268 --> 00:06:22.592
we have the number line in front of us,

00:06:22.592 --> 00:06:24.566
this is just going to be negative six.

00:06:24.566 --> 00:06:26.121
If you start at negative two,

00:06:26.121 --> 00:06:28.885
you subtract, if you subtract
two you get to negative four,

00:06:28.885 --> 00:06:31.926
you subtract another two,
you get to negative six.

00:06:31.926 --> 00:06:33.691
So we are done.

00:06:33.691 --> 00:06:35.239
Let's do one more of these.

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:39.787
Let's evaluate T plus negative U.

00:06:39.787 --> 00:06:42.482
Where once again T and U
are on this number line

00:06:42.482 --> 00:06:45.152
and it looks like each of these hashmarks

00:06:45.152 --> 00:06:47.566
we're incrementing by three as we go up.

00:06:47.566 --> 00:06:49.930
Zero, three, six.

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:53.810
And if we go down, zero,
negative three, negative six.

00:06:54.537 --> 00:06:59.111
So it's clear that U is equal to three.

00:06:59.111 --> 00:07:03.058
U is equal to three and it is also clear

00:07:03.058 --> 00:07:05.915
that T is equal to negative six.

00:07:05.915 --> 00:07:08.515
T is equal to negative six.

00:07:08.515 --> 00:07:11.919
So T plus negative U is going to be,

00:07:12.431 --> 00:07:15.798
so it's going to be negative six plus,

00:07:15.798 --> 00:07:20.798
negative six plus negative U, U is three.

00:07:22.177 --> 00:07:23.548
U is three.

00:07:23.548 --> 00:07:24.453
You want to be very careful,

00:07:24.453 --> 00:07:25.846
you might say oh well U is positive

00:07:25.846 --> 00:07:27.030
so I'm just gonna put
a positive number here,

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:28.772
but remember, it's negative U.

00:07:28.772 --> 00:07:31.255
Wherever you see the U,
replace it with the three.

00:07:31.255 --> 00:07:32.951
So it's negative three.

00:07:32.951 --> 00:07:35.134
So this is gonna be six
plus negative three,

00:07:35.134 --> 00:07:37.781
or sorry, negative six
plus negative three,

00:07:37.781 --> 00:07:42.544
which we can rewrite as
negative six minus three.

00:07:43.237 --> 00:07:45.437
All of this business can be rewritten as

00:07:45.437 --> 00:07:47.201
negative six minus three.

00:07:47.201 --> 00:07:49.175
Negative six minus three.

00:07:49.175 --> 00:07:51.311
If you're at negative six
and you go three to the left,

00:07:51.311 --> 00:07:52.984
you go three more negative,

00:07:52.984 --> 00:07:55.677
you're going to end up at negative nine.

00:07:55.677 --> 00:08:00.677
And we're all done.
