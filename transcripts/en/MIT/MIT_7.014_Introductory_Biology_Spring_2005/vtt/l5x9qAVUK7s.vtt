00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.674
OK, so I'd like to go now to
the next segment of the course.

00:00:05.674 --> 00:00:08.965
Think
you can probably appreciate

00:00:08.965 --> 00:00:12.888
little bit better this triangle
I had on

00:00:12.888 --> 00:00:17.744
before about how what
biochemists did was they tended

00:00:17.744 --> 00:00:21.968
to break cells
open, look at the component

00:00:21.968 --> 00:00:25.777
parts, through other things in
there,

00:00:25.777 --> 00:00:27.588
and then proteins.

00:00:27.588 --> 00:00:31.312
But an awful lot of stuff
having to

00:00:31.312 --> 00:00:34.614
do with function is proteins,
and what geneticists,

00:00:34.614 --> 00:00:37.257
the discipline of
genetics would do,

00:00:37.257 --> 00:00:40.560
which made mutants of living
organisms, and

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:45.184
that looked at how function was
affected by mutating individual

00:00:45.184 --> 00:00:48.704
genes, how those were both very
powerful approaches.

00:00:48.704 --> 00:00:51.763
Genetics told
you what was really important,

00:00:51.763 --> 00:00:54.435
and biochemistry told you how
it worked

00:00:54.435 --> 00:00:58.025
at a molecular level,
but the real problem is knowing

00:00:58.025 --> 00:01:00.898
whether this
thing you had doing something

00:01:00.898 --> 00:01:03.686
in the test tube was actually
the one that

00:01:03.686 --> 00:01:04.980
did it in life.

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.000
And I think I told you when
Arthur

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.575
Kornberg isolated the very
first DNA polymerase,

00:01:10.575 --> 00:01:12.000
he was able to copy DNA.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.014
And he got a Nobel prize,
and it was the first enzyme

00:01:15.014 --> 00:01:17.764
that could copy
DNA, and then John Karens made

00:01:17.764 --> 00:01:20.000
a mutant that was lacking the
enzyme.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.855
And the organism was still
alive.

00:01:21.855 --> 00:01:24.000
So therefore,
it couldn't have been

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.857
the DNA polymerase that was
copying the chromosome.

00:01:26.857 --> 00:01:29.889
It actually turned
out to be a DNA repair enzyme.

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:33.191
So, if you can actually unite
genetics and biochemistry,

00:01:33.191 --> 00:01:35.525
if you can take a mutant that's
broken in a

00:01:35.525 --> 00:01:37.897
function and you found your
protein was missing,

00:01:37.897 --> 00:01:39.209
or vice versa,
then you

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:42.253
had a very, very powerful
insight because you connect your

00:01:42.253 --> 00:01:44.472
knowledge
of what was physiologically

00:01:44.472 --> 00:01:46.578
important to the biochemistry
that

00:01:46.578 --> 00:01:47.282
you're doing.

00:01:47.282 --> 00:01:49.449
But it was really,
really hard for years,

00:01:49.449 --> 00:01:51.981
and only in
very rare occasions did some

00:01:51.981 --> 00:01:55.700
geneticists have a mutant that
suggests so strongly that some

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.629
biochemists would look,
or some

00:01:57.629 --> 00:02:01.034
biochemists would have such a
powerful result that they talked

00:02:01.034 --> 00:02:03.469
to
a geneticist and see if anybody

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:05.000
had found the result.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.428
And the power of recombinant
DNA, although it started a

00:02:08.428 --> 00:02:10.764
biotech
industry, and it made possible

00:02:10.764 --> 00:02:13.000
the sequencing of the genome,
there's

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.384
another level up one higher in
conceptual understanding.

00:02:16.384 --> 00:02:18.791
And what
it did was, it let you go back

00:02:18.791 --> 00:02:20.701
and forth between here and here.

00:02:20.701 --> 00:02:22.681
You
wouldn't have any problem now

00:02:22.681 --> 00:02:25.000
if I gave you the sequence of
the gene,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.079
you can order it.

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:29.000
You could stick it in a cell
and make massive

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.437
amounts of the protein.

00:02:30.437 --> 00:02:33.000
You purified it twenty-fold and
it would

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.446
be pure, whereas before you
might have had to purified it

00:02:36.446 --> 00:02:38.937
fifteen
thousand-fold out of 1,000 g of

00:02:38.937 --> 00:02:42.723
cells, and you would have had to
been a very good biochemists

00:02:42.723 --> 00:02:45.000
with 15 steps in order to purify
it.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.015
So, you can go from the
sequence of the gene to the

00:02:48.015 --> 00:02:50.981
protein, or if we
got a protein and we wanted to

00:02:50.981 --> 00:02:53.443
know which gene we'd just
sequence a bit

00:02:53.443 --> 00:02:55.775
of the protein,
use that genetic code,

00:02:55.775 --> 00:02:59.134
work ourselves backwards to
some possible sequences,

00:02:59.134 --> 00:03:01.888
then go looking for the
sequences, and then

00:03:01.888 --> 00:03:03.252
go find the gene.

00:03:03.252 --> 00:03:06.141
So, what recombinant DNA allows
us

00:03:06.141 --> 00:03:07.650
to do is close that loop.

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.426
You can go from genetics to
biochemistry and

00:03:10.426 --> 00:03:11.401
back and forth.

00:03:11.401 --> 00:03:14.712
Now everybody does everything
instead of it being

00:03:14.712 --> 00:03:17.943
isolated disciplines,
which it was when I entered the

00:03:17.943 --> 00:03:18.315
field.

00:03:18.315 --> 00:03:20.966
So, all
of the stuff depended on the

00:03:20.966 --> 00:03:24.222
development to clone particular
pieces of DNA.

00:03:24.222 --> 00:03:27.570
And I want to make clear right
at the beginning,

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:31.857
there's a couple of uses of
cloning that are in popular

00:03:31.857 --> 00:03:33.209
usage right now.

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:36.000
What we're talking about in
this

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.970
lecture is cloning a piece of
DNA.

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.000
What that means,
is I'm going to

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.898
take a particular segment of
DNA, say, cut it here,

00:03:42.898 --> 00:03:44.000
and cut it there.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.014
And I'm going to take that
piece, and I'm going to do

00:03:47.014 --> 00:03:49.611
something to it
that lets me amplify it and

00:03:49.611 --> 00:03:52.000
make many, many copies of that
piece of

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.235
DNA.

00:03:52.235 --> 00:03:55.705
And cloning of anything else
you make a whole lot of copies.

00:03:55.705 --> 00:03:57.772
So
that's one use of the word

00:03:57.772 --> 00:03:58.318
cloning.

00:03:58.318 --> 00:04:00.908
The other use,
which you see in the

00:04:00.908 --> 00:04:05.358
popular press all the time,
is cloning an individual,

00:04:05.358 --> 00:04:08.897
thought being
there: you would take the

00:04:08.897 --> 00:04:12.544
nucleus from the cell of the
individual,

00:04:12.544 --> 00:04:17.604
put that nucleus into an egg
that didn't have its own nucleus

00:04:17.604 --> 00:04:20.643
moved,
and now you hope what you get

00:04:20.643 --> 00:04:24.180
out of that is an organism that
has all the

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:30.000
same genetic content as the
starting individual.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.594
And in fact,
although it sounds very good in

00:04:32.594 --> 00:04:36.167
paper, is you're probably
beginning to see it's not the

00:04:36.167 --> 00:04:38.569
panacea that people thought it
was,

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:42.162
or that we'd have to worry that
in 10 years, all of my MIT

00:04:42.162 --> 00:04:44.203
students
would be clones of the

00:04:44.203 --> 00:04:47.141
brightest person in the class or
anything like

00:04:47.141 --> 00:04:50.679
that, because other stuff
happens, that you get to in

00:04:50.679 --> 00:04:52.483
advanced
biology courses,

00:04:52.483 --> 00:04:54.724
but there are modifications of
DNA.

00:04:54.724 --> 00:04:57.969
There's all
sorts of stuff that happens to

00:04:57.969 --> 00:05:00.000
it, so it's not identical.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
And so many of these cloned
organisms, like Dolly the sheep,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.855
that was famous,
died early with,

00:05:05.855 --> 00:05:07.652
I forget, arthritis and things.

00:05:07.652 --> 00:05:09.714
So,
there are a lot of problems on

00:05:09.714 --> 00:05:10.342
that score.

00:05:10.342 --> 00:05:13.771
But that's the other use of
the word cloning and that's not

00:05:13.771 --> 00:05:16.000
what these next three lectures
that we

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.285
are talking about cloning a
piece of DNA.

00:05:18.285 --> 00:05:21.183
And that was the big problem
that faced the field,

00:05:21.183 --> 00:05:24.000
certainly when I was an
undergrad and even when I

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.857
was a grad student I was
interested in synthesizing

00:05:26.857 --> 00:05:28.000
pieces of DNA,
and

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.696
it was one of those things that
people said, why are you doing

00:05:31.696 --> 00:05:32.000
it?

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.086
Well, because you could try to
do it.

00:05:34.086 --> 00:05:37.250
What if you got a piece of DNA,
like Gobind Khorana,

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:40.000
who's my colleague,
who got the Nobel prize

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.972
for synthesizing the first
gene.

00:05:41.972 --> 00:05:43.118
He synthesized it.

00:05:43.118 --> 00:05:46.187
It was a tRNA
gene that was 120 nucleotide

00:05:46.187 --> 00:05:48.245
base pairs long or something.

00:05:48.245 --> 00:05:49.647
He
synthesized it.

00:05:49.647 --> 00:05:51.533
He'd shown you could do it.

00:05:51.533 --> 00:05:54.116
But you couldn't do
anything with it.

00:05:54.116 --> 00:05:56.677
And there were sort of two big
problems.

00:05:56.677 --> 00:05:59.240
One was
the fact that this DNA,

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:03.169
although it's not a monotonous
tetranucleotide.

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:05.308
It's pretty hard to tell.

00:06:05.308 --> 00:06:08.242
Each one
of these things is a base pair,

00:06:08.242 --> 00:06:10.750
and human DNA has 3 billion of
those.

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:13.954
And a bit down here,
doesn't look very different

00:06:13.954 --> 00:06:15.635
than the bit out
there.

00:06:15.635 --> 00:06:19.750
And it certainly wouldn't looks
very different than the bit of

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:23.919
DNA that's 2 billion base pairs
over on the other side of campus

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:24.883
or
something.

00:06:24.883 --> 00:06:28.369
So, there is no way to take DNA
and cut it reproducibly,

00:06:28.369 --> 00:06:30.489
so
you to get fragments.

00:06:30.489 --> 00:06:34.763
What you could see from first
principles was what you would

00:06:34.763 --> 00:06:36.174
need was magic scissors.

00:06:36.174 --> 00:06:38.527
And what would
the scissors look like?

00:06:38.527 --> 00:06:41.291
Well, it would have to be
scissors that could

00:06:41.291 --> 00:06:44.303
read a sequence as there's
nothing else different.

00:06:44.303 --> 00:06:46.396
You know it's a
regular backbone,

00:06:46.396 --> 00:06:48.194
and it's only four nucleotides.

00:06:48.194 --> 00:06:51.234
So, if you wanted to
cut DNA in particular places,

00:06:51.234 --> 00:06:53.646
you had to have scissors that
could see

00:06:53.646 --> 00:06:54.322
a sequence.

00:06:54.322 --> 00:06:57.210
And furthermore,
you can see they couldn't just,

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:59.607
there
are the hydrogen bonding parts

00:06:59.607 --> 00:07:01.882
of A and T or G and C because
those

00:07:01.882 --> 00:07:06.000
are stuck together there in the
middle of the DNA.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.551
So, you'd need scissors that
could somehow find a sequence

00:07:09.551 --> 00:07:10.643
and make a
cut.

00:07:10.643 --> 00:07:12.121
And those were found.

00:07:12.121 --> 00:07:14.726
I'm going to till you about
those.

00:07:14.726 --> 00:07:16.815
They're called restriction
enzymes.

00:07:16.815 --> 00:07:18.659
So that was part of the thing.

00:07:18.659 --> 00:07:20.046
The
other thing was,

00:07:20.046 --> 00:07:22.258
imagine I could cut out this
fragment.

00:07:22.258 --> 00:07:24.621
And they gave it
to you, and I said,

00:07:24.621 --> 00:07:24.990
great.

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:25.974
Now I've got it.

00:07:25.974 --> 00:07:29.680
Would you make me a lot of
copies of this DNA?

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:31.444
Could you do that?

00:07:31.444 --> 00:07:36.021
Let's say, you
now know how to transform the

00:07:36.021 --> 00:07:39.882
principle that we saw back with
Avery.

00:07:39.882 --> 00:07:45.555
We could take naked DNA and put
this fragment into the cell.

00:07:45.555 --> 00:07:47.373
Would it replicate?

00:07:47.373 --> 00:07:49.096
What do you think?

00:07:49.096 --> 00:07:50.724
Anybody remember?

00:07:50.724 --> 00:07:51.011
No?

00:07:51.011 --> 00:07:55.454
OK,
we talked about some other

00:07:55.454 --> 00:07:58.000
languages, right?

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.943
But one of the things that's in
the DNA is the genetic code with

00:08:01.943 --> 00:08:02.985
all the
genes.

00:08:02.985 --> 00:08:05.270
And we can find the reading
frame.

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:09.164
Remember when we talked
about an origin of replication.

00:08:09.164 --> 00:08:11.711
I said that was sort of,
at least for

00:08:11.711 --> 00:08:13.539
E.
coli there's one origin.

00:08:13.539 --> 00:08:16.283
In eukaryotes the origins are
spaced

00:08:16.283 --> 00:08:17.458
out along the DNA.

00:08:17.458 --> 00:08:20.463
And every time you have a round
of replication,

00:08:20.463 --> 00:08:22.422
it
starts with one of those

00:08:22.422 --> 00:08:23.859
origins and then goes.

00:08:23.859 --> 00:08:27.574
So the chance of this
piece of DNA by chance is going

00:08:27.574 --> 00:08:30.000
to have an origin is pretty
small.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.293
So if I put it into an
organism, it's going to sit

00:08:33.293 --> 00:08:36.490
there, if you're
lucky, maybe degraded because

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:39.139
it's got blunt ends,
or even if I made

00:08:39.139 --> 00:08:42.949
it into circle it probably
wouldn't replicate because it

00:08:42.949 --> 00:08:45.680
probably
doesn't have the word in the

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:48.283
DNA that says "start a round of
DNA

00:08:48.283 --> 00:08:49.325
replication".

00:08:49.325 --> 00:08:52.855
So, the other overarching
principle of DNA

00:08:52.855 --> 00:08:56.855
replication is you somehow have
to take the fragment of DNA that

00:08:56.855 --> 00:08:59.297
you're
looking at, and you have to

00:08:59.297 --> 00:09:02.000
attach it to an origin of
replication.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.666
Now, if you have an origin of
replication and you have a

00:09:05.666 --> 00:09:08.222
fragment
of DNA, and you put it in the

00:09:08.222 --> 00:09:10.799
cell, now you'll get a lot of
copies of

00:09:10.799 --> 00:09:11.964
that piece of DNA.

00:09:11.964 --> 00:09:15.200
So that's what recombinant DNA
is all about in a

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:17.056
really, really simple form.

00:09:17.056 --> 00:09:19.600
I'm just going to take you now
into

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:21.831
increasing sort of levels of
detail.

00:09:21.831 --> 00:09:24.000
So, let me just sort of give
you

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.893
just sort of a really broad
view of this cloning,

00:09:26.893 --> 00:09:30.835
and then we'll sort of
start to dive in to some of the

00:09:30.835 --> 00:09:34.743
fancier techniques that
have come out of this.

00:09:34.743 --> 00:09:38.100
We'll talk about DNA
sequencing, and

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:41.111
PCR, and stuff in the next
lecture.

00:09:41.111 --> 00:09:44.299
So the first principle here is
to

00:09:44.299 --> 00:09:47.984
cut the DNA,
and I know you may think this

00:09:47.984 --> 00:09:50.500
is sort of baby talk,
but

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:52.222
this is how I think.

00:09:52.222 --> 00:09:56.700
If you really think about this
stuff, this is what

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:57.979
it really is.

00:09:57.979 --> 00:10:02.013
With sequence specific
molecular scissors,

00:10:02.013 --> 00:10:04.989
these
have the rather odd name.

00:10:04.989 --> 00:10:08.000
They're called restriction
enzymes.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.436
I don't know if any of you know
why they're called restriction

00:10:11.436 --> 00:10:13.797
enzymes,
and although I'm sure that some

00:10:13.797 --> 00:10:16.000
of you have used them in your
UROP to

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.235
cut up pieces of DNA.

00:10:17.235 --> 00:10:19.411
But what that does,
these are enzymes,

00:10:19.411 --> 00:10:21.857
as I'll
tell you, that recognize a

00:10:21.857 --> 00:10:23.285
particular sequence.

00:10:23.285 --> 00:10:25.964
And they
always cut at that sequence.

00:10:25.964 --> 00:10:29.836
The value of that is you can
reproducibly cut DNA exactly

00:10:29.836 --> 00:10:32.000
the same spot,
and the spots are

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000
specified by whatever sequence
that particular pair of scissors

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.431
knows how to read.

00:10:37.431 --> 00:10:40.453
Then the next thing we have to
do is

00:10:40.453 --> 00:10:44.721
we need to join the piece of
DNA to an origin of replication.

00:10:44.721 --> 00:10:47.424
So the
thing that carries the origin

00:10:47.424 --> 00:10:49.772
of replication is called a
vector.

00:10:49.772 --> 00:10:51.804
And
usually, not always,

00:10:51.804 --> 00:10:53.185
these are circles.

00:10:53.185 --> 00:10:56.295
We'll consider the ones
that grow in E.

00:10:56.295 --> 00:10:59.346
coli are most of the time,
or in bacteria,

00:10:59.346 --> 00:11:00.685
mostly
circles.

00:11:00.685 --> 00:11:05.000
They are the ones that are
broadly used for most cloning.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.241
So, we'll talk about those.

00:11:08.241 --> 00:11:10.643
What makes a vector?

00:11:10.643 --> 00:11:15.634
What it has to have
is an origin of DNA

00:11:15.634 --> 00:11:17.118
replication.

00:11:17.118 --> 00:11:21.571
They usually have something
else.

00:11:21.571 --> 00:11:29.856
We could call it a selectable
marker, but something like

00:11:29.856 --> 00:11:31.867
a drug resistance.

00:11:31.867 --> 00:11:36.000
If any of you have done cloning
in a

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.314
UROP usually it's something
like a gene for making the cell

00:11:39.314 --> 00:11:41.793
ampicillin
resistant, or tetracycline

00:11:41.793 --> 00:11:45.757
resistant, some antibiotic that
would normally kill the cell.

00:11:45.757 --> 00:11:48.000
So you can tell,
does that cell have

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.343
that vector or not because the
cell starts out ampicillin

00:11:51.343 --> 00:11:53.650
sensitive
but it acquires the vector

00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:56.000
that's replicating it,
also acquires

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000
the gene that gives it the drug
resistance.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.304
But if we're going to cut that,
if we're going to join a piece

00:12:05.304 --> 00:12:08.416
of DNA
to that, we can't join into a

00:12:08.416 --> 00:12:10.666
circle without breaking it.

00:12:10.666 --> 00:12:14.476
So, we need to
cut the vector at a unique

00:12:14.476 --> 00:12:14.952
site.

00:12:14.952 --> 00:12:19.454
And we would use a restriction
enzyme for that.

00:12:19.454 --> 00:12:23.272
And you can also see in
designing a vector,

00:12:23.272 --> 00:12:28.421
you'd
want something that only has

00:12:28.421 --> 00:12:30.000
one site.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.322
So, what we would have achieved
from this conceptually as we've

00:12:35.322 --> 00:12:38.327
now got
this, this is the vector,

00:12:38.327 --> 00:12:42.363
its origin of replication here,
and let's say

00:12:42.363 --> 00:12:45.242
ampicillin resistance,
for example,

00:12:45.242 --> 00:12:48.544
as a selectable marker,
the gene for

00:12:48.544 --> 00:12:50.863
that could be encoded here.

00:12:50.863 --> 00:12:54.726
And we have the fragment of,
if you want to

00:12:54.726 --> 00:12:59.315
that down, just put it down on
the floor, I think.

00:12:59.315 --> 00:13:03.046
We've made the
point at this stage.

00:13:03.046 --> 00:13:03.794
Thanks.

00:13:03.794 --> 00:13:07.750
What one has to do is to join
this

00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:10.032
piece of DNA to that.

00:13:10.032 --> 00:13:15.250
And we'll go to the molecular
details of this.

00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:22.068
But, we'll join the fragment to
the vector, and actually this

00:13:22.068 --> 00:13:25.996
was
something that was already in

00:13:25.996 --> 00:13:30.250
molecular biologists' toolkits,
have

00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:32.837
been studying DNA replication.

00:13:32.837 --> 00:13:34.390
That's DNA ligase.

00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:37.055
When we finish
an Okazaki fragment,

00:13:37.055 --> 00:13:39.571
we had to seal nicks and the
enzyme that

00:13:39.571 --> 00:13:41.788
did that was an enzyme called
DNA ligase.

00:13:41.788 --> 00:13:44.801
So, molecular biologists
basically had the scotch tape

00:13:44.801 --> 00:13:46.999
or the glue to join stuff back
together.

00:13:46.999 --> 00:13:50.016
What they were missing for
many, many years where the

00:13:50.016 --> 00:13:52.242
sequence-
specific molecular scissors.

00:13:52.242 --> 00:13:54.427
So at this stage,
if we were doing the

00:13:54.427 --> 00:13:56.509
recombinant DNA,
we now have a vector.

00:13:56.509 --> 00:13:59.593
We now have a piece of DNA
joined to it.

00:13:59.593 --> 00:14:03.500
In fact, we probably have a
whole

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:08.338
other mess of things that
happens along the way.

00:14:08.338 --> 00:14:12.833
But at the moment,
they're in a test tube.

00:14:12.833 --> 00:14:17.500
So, if we want to have this
thing grow, what

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:19.638
do we have to do next?

00:14:19.638 --> 00:14:24.500
We are going to have to get the
DNA from outside

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:27.073
the cell inside the cell.

00:14:27.073 --> 00:14:31.500
That's the word;
we need to transform the

00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:33.150
DNA into a cell.

00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:37.071
Again, the word transform,
that goes

00:14:37.071 --> 00:14:40.177
back to those transformation
experiments with the

00:14:40.177 --> 00:14:43.040
Streptococcus
pneumonia going from smooth to

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:45.355
rough, and you are taking stuff
from

00:14:45.355 --> 00:14:48.372
the cell that transformed them
from rough to smooth,

00:14:48.372 --> 00:14:50.935
whatever, that's
where the word came from,

00:14:50.935 --> 00:14:53.639
but we now know it's getting
naked DNA inside

00:14:53.639 --> 00:14:55.654
the cell where it can be
replicated.

00:14:55.654 --> 00:14:57.783
And then the next thing we need
to

00:14:57.783 --> 00:15:01.375
know is, what cells have
acquired this vector that at

00:15:01.375 --> 00:15:03.657
least
has the vector.

00:15:03.657 --> 00:15:09.328
We'll settle for that in the
beginning, and to do that,

00:15:09.328 --> 00:15:13.000
you need to select for the
marker on the

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:13.617
vector.

00:15:13.617 --> 00:15:18.205
In the case of this one,
we would start with a strain

00:15:18.205 --> 00:15:20.852
that's
killed by ampicillin,

00:15:20.852 --> 00:15:25.000
and then we just plate it out
and ask for guys

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.459
that are ampicillin resistant.

00:15:27.459 --> 00:15:31.333
And, you can see that there is
another class of problem

00:15:31.333 --> 00:15:34.000
because if we had uncut vector,
and there would

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.277
probably be,
for sure, some of that in our

00:15:36.277 --> 00:15:38.848
mix, that would make the cell
amp resistant.

00:15:38.848 --> 00:15:42.000
And if we had an insert,
it would be amp resistant.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.388
So, if we really wanted to get
into this, we'd have to do some

00:15:45.388 --> 00:15:47.696
more work
to sort out what's on there.

00:15:47.696 --> 00:15:49.333
But that's the basic stuff.

00:15:49.333 --> 00:15:51.235
I suspect
most of you know this

00:15:51.235 --> 00:15:53.058
practically since kindergarten.

00:15:53.058 --> 00:15:55.870
But that's the
overall framework into which,

00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:58.000
now, I'm going to start
layering

00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.796
different pieces of detail.

00:15:59.796 --> 00:16:02.125
And the next part,
again, some of

00:16:02.125 --> 00:16:02.914
you may know.

00:16:02.914 --> 00:16:05.950
I don't think it will be a
totally foreign concept.

00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:08.075
You
are probably familiar with

00:16:08.075 --> 00:16:10.625
this, that what are these
restriction

00:16:10.625 --> 00:16:11.164
enzymes?

00:16:11.164 --> 00:16:14.065
The actual word is restriction
endonuclease.

00:16:14.065 --> 00:16:16.291
They are
often usually called

00:16:16.291 --> 00:16:19.125
restriction enzymes in a lab
parlance.

00:16:19.125 --> 00:16:22.039
Nuclease is something that cuts
the nucleic acid,

00:16:22.039 --> 00:16:25.075
and endonuclease is
one that doesn't need a free

00:16:25.075 --> 00:16:25.317
end.

00:16:25.317 --> 00:16:27.625
So, it can cut in the middle of
the

00:16:27.625 --> 00:16:30.638
sequence instead of nibbling at
the end.

00:16:30.638 --> 00:16:33.635
That would be
an exonuclease.

00:16:33.635 --> 00:16:37.625
So, these things have names
that

00:16:37.625 --> 00:16:43.528
tend to be something like
EcoRI, which has something to do

00:16:43.528 --> 00:16:47.367
with where
they are derived from.

00:16:47.367 --> 00:16:52.125
And a typical one,
one of the very first

00:16:52.125 --> 00:16:57.063
ones that is still in really
wide use, is EcoRI.

00:16:57.063 --> 00:17:01.752
And this recognizes
the sequence G A A T T C.

00:17:01.752 --> 00:17:05.271
Now, you'll notice that if you
read

00:17:05.271 --> 00:17:09.281
the sequence in this way it's
the same sequence when you read

00:17:09.281 --> 00:17:10.986
it on
the other strand.

00:17:10.986 --> 00:17:14.361
It's called a palindrome but be
careful because

00:17:14.361 --> 00:17:17.786
palindromes in English,
those are words that you read

00:17:17.786 --> 00:17:19.675
from the front
to the back;

00:17:19.675 --> 00:17:20.763
they're the same.

00:17:20.763 --> 00:17:23.452
In an English letter,
it doesn't matter

00:17:23.452 --> 00:17:28.000
whether it's in A here or an A
there.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.236
But you guys know something
about DNA structure.

00:17:31.236 --> 00:17:34.060
There's a five to
three prime polarity.

00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:37.228
So, reading this way doesn't
look at all the

00:17:37.228 --> 00:17:37.583
same.

00:17:37.583 --> 00:17:39.216
It's totally different.

00:17:39.216 --> 00:17:41.844
But reading in this strand,
we say

00:17:41.844 --> 00:17:43.290
that's five to three.

00:17:43.290 --> 00:17:46.460
The thing that's identical is
the reciprocal

00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:48.292
sequence on the other side.

00:17:48.292 --> 00:17:51.076
So there is this,
you see G A A and G A

00:17:51.076 --> 00:17:54.131
A but it's not like the English
word palindrome,

00:17:54.131 --> 00:17:57.682
so don't get yourself
mixed up about that.

00:17:57.682 --> 00:18:01.165
Anyway, what this will then,
what

00:18:01.165 --> 00:18:06.442
this enzyme then does,
is it cuts to the side here.

00:18:06.442 --> 00:18:08.951
It cuts
symmetrically.

00:18:08.951 --> 00:18:13.829
And what it generates then is a
G three prime

00:18:13.829 --> 00:18:14.668
hydroxyl.

00:18:14.668 --> 00:18:16.531
Remember the ribose?

00:18:16.531 --> 00:18:20.163
If we have, say,
an A there, this is

00:18:20.163 --> 00:18:24.821
the three prime position,
and that's the five prime

00:18:24.821 --> 00:18:27.033
position in the
sugar.

00:18:27.033 --> 00:18:31.761
So, it leaves a three prime
hydroxyl, and is also then

00:18:31.761 --> 00:18:36.045
leaves a
five prime phosphate.

00:18:36.045 --> 00:18:41.400
So, we'd have A A T T C here,
and

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:48.797
then on the other side,
we would get the reciprocal

00:18:48.797 --> 00:18:49.684
thing.

00:18:49.684 --> 00:18:57.184
So, we'd have
G with a three prime hydroxyl,

00:18:57.184 --> 00:19:03.000
and then over A A T T C like
that.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.417
So now we've got a break here.

00:19:05.417 --> 00:19:07.352
We can pull those apart.

00:19:07.352 --> 00:19:10.513
But one of
the nice things you can see

00:19:10.513 --> 00:19:13.799
right from this is that we're
generating

00:19:13.799 --> 00:19:17.572
five prime single stranded
ends, and this one is the

00:19:17.572 --> 00:19:19.200
sequence A A T T C.

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:22.090
This is A A T T C here,
and these guys,

00:19:22.090 --> 00:19:26.809
if they could get together and
line up as they would here,

00:19:26.809 --> 00:19:30.000
they'd be able to form hydrogen
bonds.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.353
So, if you take an enzyme like
EcoRI, and we took,

00:19:33.353 --> 00:19:36.312
let's say, a
circle that had a single EcoRI

00:19:36.312 --> 00:19:38.759
site, G A A T T C,
if we cut it with

00:19:38.759 --> 00:19:41.465
the restriction enzyme we would
make nicks.

00:19:41.465 --> 00:19:44.774
And if we kept it cold,
all that we'd have is DNA

00:19:44.774 --> 00:19:45.166
nicks.

00:19:45.166 --> 00:19:47.519
And if we warm things up a
little

00:19:47.519 --> 00:19:51.900
bit, there's only four hydrogen
bonds that are holding that

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:52.515
together.

00:19:52.515 --> 00:19:56.279
So, the thing would linearize
and just flop around in

00:19:56.279 --> 00:19:56.940
the breeze.

00:19:56.940 --> 00:19:59.881
If we cooled it slowly,
the thermodynamically most

00:19:59.881 --> 00:20:02.630
favorable
state, the lowest energy state,

00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:05.044
would be with those ends coming
back

00:20:05.044 --> 00:20:05.615
together.

00:20:05.615 --> 00:20:07.647
So, we could then add DNA
ligase.

00:20:07.647 --> 00:20:10.490
If we added these up and
added DNA ligase,

00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:13.807
we could reverse the process
and go back and forth,

00:20:13.807 --> 00:20:16.453
EcoRI to cut it,
ligase to ligate.

00:20:16.453 --> 00:20:19.500
And then, the beauty of
recombinant

00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:26.500
DNA is this rejoining part
doesn't see what's out here or

00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:28.321
what's out there.

00:20:28.321 --> 00:20:32.285
All it sees is the little ends
that

00:20:32.285 --> 00:20:34.308
are generated by an EcoRI site.

00:20:34.308 --> 00:20:36.855
So they take some of my DNA,
and I'll

00:20:36.855 --> 00:20:37.580
cut it up.

00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:41.425
I'll get a zillion EcoRI
fragments, but they'll all

00:20:41.425 --> 00:20:44.056
have the same little
overhanging bit that's

00:20:44.056 --> 00:20:45.998
complementary to the vector.

00:20:45.998 --> 00:20:50.569
So if I take a vector cut with
EcoRI, and I take some of my own

00:20:50.569 --> 00:20:53.730
DNA and I mix them,
I can get a little fragment,

00:20:53.730 --> 00:20:57.070
get in between the
vector, and it does exactly

00:20:57.070 --> 00:20:59.712
that joining that I was
diagramming

00:20:59.712 --> 00:21:01.072
right here.

00:21:01.072 --> 00:21:05.400
So again, it was the discovery
of

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:10.802
these restriction enzymes that
made possible almost all the

00:21:10.802 --> 00:21:15.211
stuff that's
happened in biology since 1975.

00:21:15.211 --> 00:21:19.000
The development of restriction
enzymes

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.284
was essentially,
I was a postdoc at Berkeley at

00:21:23.284 --> 00:21:27.971
that point and the labs,
Stan Cohen at Stanford,

00:21:27.971 --> 00:21:32.598
Herb Boyer at UCSF,
and a two others around the

00:21:32.598 --> 00:21:35.042
country were working on this.

00:21:35.042 --> 00:21:38.076
They were almost all labs that
had

00:21:38.076 --> 00:21:39.901
worked on bacterial plasmids.

00:21:39.901 --> 00:21:42.230
Plasmids are little circles of
DNA,

00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:45.849
so the labs that started were
ones who have been busy studying

00:21:45.849 --> 00:21:48.009
little
circles of DNA that usually

00:21:48.009 --> 00:21:50.116
carry drug-resistance between
cells.

00:21:50.116 --> 00:21:52.258
And
so that was happening while I

00:21:52.258 --> 00:21:53.089
was a postdoc.

00:21:53.089 --> 00:21:56.500
And when I got to MIT in
'76 the technology was just

00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:57.171
beginning.

00:21:57.171 --> 00:22:00.752
I was one of the first
labs trying to cut pieces of

00:22:00.752 --> 00:22:03.000
DNA and join them back together.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.571
So, it's a pretty recent
development.

00:22:05.571 --> 00:22:07.000
At that point,
DNA

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.850
sequencing hadn't been
invented.

00:22:08.850 --> 00:22:11.000
The idea that you could pull
out a

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.536
piece of DNA and do something
with it or produce a protein was

00:22:14.536 --> 00:22:15.470
just a
thought.

00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:16.411
It didn't exist.

00:22:16.411 --> 00:22:19.000
So it's hard to overemphasize
how critical

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.764
the discovery of these
restriction enzymes were.

00:22:21.764 --> 00:22:24.846
Now, I just want to
tell you where they came from,

00:22:24.846 --> 00:22:26.384
or how people found them.

00:22:26.384 --> 00:22:28.937
And I'll
try and do this quickly because

00:22:28.937 --> 00:22:32.055
I know some of you get impatient
with history.

00:22:32.055 --> 00:22:35.142
But this is really important
because

00:22:35.142 --> 00:22:37.760
it's very easy to make fun of
basic research.

00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:40.335
You can ridicule anything
pretty easily,

00:22:40.335 --> 00:22:43.711
and you might just ask because
I'm telling you the

00:22:43.711 --> 00:22:44.120
story.

00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:46.093
Somebody proposed doing this.

00:22:46.093 --> 00:22:49.762
I'm going to tell you the
experiment that basically is

00:22:49.762 --> 00:22:52.284
the basis of the biotech
industry, and

00:22:52.284 --> 00:22:55.617
would you have been smart
enough to recognize that it was

00:22:55.617 --> 00:22:58.020
the discovery
of a phenomenon called

00:22:58.020 --> 00:23:00.855
restriction, restriction of
bacteriophage

00:23:00.855 --> 00:23:02.396
growth on bacteria?

00:23:02.396 --> 00:23:07.108
And it was, here are actually a
couple of EM's of these little

00:23:07.108 --> 00:23:07.719
plasmids.

00:23:07.719 --> 00:23:10.183
This is an electron
micrograph one.

00:23:10.183 --> 00:23:12.901
In these little circles it's
been shadowed.

00:23:12.901 --> 00:23:15.231
And
this is actually artificially

00:23:15.231 --> 00:23:17.497
colored, but that was the kind
of

00:23:17.497 --> 00:23:19.722
plasmids that people were
cutting up.

00:23:19.722 --> 00:23:21.638
So, as I said,
trying to get

00:23:21.638 --> 00:23:23.500
through this DNA,
and the stuff,

00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:25.782
what's made possible the
sequencing

00:23:25.782 --> 00:23:29.926
at the Whitehead Genome Center
and stuff that I'll tell you

00:23:29.926 --> 00:23:31.386
about is going on.

00:23:31.386 --> 00:23:34.142
I didn't really set this one
up.

00:23:34.142 --> 00:23:37.467
But that's Eric Lander who
teaches 7.012 in the fall.

00:23:37.467 --> 00:23:40.056
I told you a
picture from that DNA 50th.

00:23:40.056 --> 00:23:42.711
Well, they had a banquet at the
end of it,

00:23:42.711 --> 00:23:43.720
and I was there.

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:46.998
This is Svante Paabo from
Europe who is sequencing

00:23:46.998 --> 00:23:48.136
the chimp genome.

00:23:48.136 --> 00:23:51.284
And that's Francis Collins who
is head of the

00:23:51.284 --> 00:23:53.102
entire Human Genome Project.

00:23:53.102 --> 00:23:55.569
This is Evelyn Witkin,
who was a big

00:23:55.569 --> 00:23:58.169
discoverer of early DNA repair
events.

00:23:58.169 --> 00:24:01.102
And I put that one in
because it was sort of

00:24:01.102 --> 00:24:01.781
interesting.

00:24:01.781 --> 00:24:03.310
There was Eric,
and Savandi,

00:24:03.310 --> 00:24:05.472
and
Francis were talking about what

00:24:05.472 --> 00:24:08.842
would happen when they knew the
sequence of the chimp genome,

00:24:08.842 --> 00:24:09.804
which wasn't done.

00:24:09.804 --> 00:24:11.516
And there was an
advertisement,

00:24:11.516 --> 00:24:13.753
a poster advertising Jim
Watson's latest book.

00:24:13.753 --> 00:24:15.453
And they
ripped that in half,

00:24:15.453 --> 00:24:17.880
and were writing notes on the
back all the

00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:18.911
way through dinner.

00:24:18.911 --> 00:24:21.410
So if you want to see what
scientists on the

00:24:21.410 --> 00:24:23.440
cutting edge,
including someone who teaches

00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:26.214
701 the fall looks like when
they are not teaching 701,

00:24:26.214 --> 00:24:27.145
there is a picture.

00:24:27.145 --> 00:24:29.949
So anyway, the discovery
of restriction enzymes was

00:24:29.949 --> 00:24:32.000
Salvador Luria,
who I've mentioned.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.266
He was a member of the biology
department, and one of our Nobel

00:24:36.266 --> 00:24:37.245
Prize winners.

00:24:37.245 --> 00:24:39.273
He started the Cancer Center.

00:24:39.273 --> 00:24:42.299
He also trained
Jim Watson, when I showed you

00:24:42.299 --> 00:24:43.091
that picture.

00:24:43.091 --> 00:24:45.454
This is Salvador standing
over here.

00:24:45.454 --> 00:24:49.064
Another thing that Salvador
did, he was a Nobel Prize

00:24:49.064 --> 00:24:51.931
winner but he taught
introductory biology.

00:24:51.931 --> 00:24:55.263
So I am basically
following in the footsteps of

00:24:55.263 --> 00:24:55.863
Salvador.

00:24:55.863 --> 00:24:59.228
He wrote a book called,
even though he was a Nobel

00:24:59.228 --> 00:25:01.865
Prize winner,
a book called "36 Lectures

00:25:01.865 --> 00:25:03.590
in Introductory Biology.

00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:06.250
And some universities,
the intro to

00:25:06.250 --> 00:25:10.358
biology is taught by whoever is
at the bottom of the food chain.

00:25:10.358 --> 00:25:12.549
The
most junior professor gets

00:25:12.549 --> 00:25:14.488
stuck with intro to biology.

00:25:14.488 --> 00:25:16.489
And here
it's the other way.

00:25:16.489 --> 00:25:19.750
I mean you're getting Eric and
Bob, for example,

00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:22.684
Weinberg to teach in the fall,
tells you that.

00:25:22.684 --> 00:25:26.148
And really where that
comes from is the fact that

00:25:26.148 --> 00:25:28.750
Salvador Luria had such an
interest

00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:29.968
in replication.

00:25:29.968 --> 00:25:32.811
So he trained Jim Watson,
started

00:25:32.811 --> 00:25:35.570
the Cancer Center here,
and he also carried out this

00:25:35.570 --> 00:25:37.126
phenomenon of
restriction.

00:25:37.126 --> 00:25:39.542
And he did this working with
bacteriophage.

00:25:39.542 --> 00:25:41.250
And I
know some of you wrote,

00:25:41.250 --> 00:25:43.373
you don't like to see old guys
on porches.

00:25:43.373 --> 00:25:44.616
So
I got freaked out,

00:25:44.616 --> 00:25:47.308
and I took this next picture
out for this morning.

00:25:47.308 --> 00:25:49.874
Oh, I've got to show it anyway
for two reasons.

00:25:49.874 --> 00:25:52.430
This is Salvador
sitting on a porch at Cold

00:25:52.430 --> 00:25:54.559
Spring Harbor with Max Delbruck
who

00:25:54.559 --> 00:25:56.426
started, really,
much of the work on

00:25:56.426 --> 00:25:59.837
bacteriophage that gave us the
underpinnings of microbiology.

00:25:59.837 --> 00:26:01.763
And I put it partly on A)
because

00:26:01.763 --> 00:26:05.291
it shows the informality of the
molecular biology culture which

00:26:05.291 --> 00:26:07.897
persists to this day,
and B) because Salvador had

00:26:07.897 --> 00:26:09.610
such an impish
sense of humor.

00:26:09.610 --> 00:26:12.349
You would have really enjoyed
had he been teaching

00:26:12.349 --> 00:26:13.022
this course.

00:26:13.022 --> 00:26:15.880
Anyway, Salvador was studying
just bacteriophage.

00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:17.355
Remember we talked about it?

00:26:17.355 --> 00:26:19.410
And they're basically a
syringe, they

00:26:19.410 --> 00:26:21.023
injected their DNA into the
cell.

00:26:21.023 --> 00:26:22.586
There's an electron micrograph.

00:26:22.586 --> 00:26:24.025
The
DNA is up top there.

00:26:24.025 --> 00:26:26.469
It goes in, and then the DNA
takes over the

00:26:26.469 --> 00:26:30.000
cell, reprograms it,
and makes baby phage.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.201
And I showed you how we make
plaques.

00:26:33.201 --> 00:26:36.780
So that was what Salvador
was studying.

00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:41.384
And it's a little like what we
are talking about with

00:26:41.384 --> 00:26:41.969
Mendel.

00:26:41.969 --> 00:26:46.490
He didn't have very many
techniques available to him at

00:26:46.490 --> 00:26:47.476
the
time.

00:26:47.476 --> 00:26:49.481
He couldn't sequence DNA.

00:26:49.481 --> 00:26:51.966
He couldn't do a lot of things.

00:26:51.966 --> 00:26:55.077
But he
could plate phage and count,

00:26:55.077 --> 00:26:56.810
and things like that.

00:26:56.810 --> 00:27:00.012
And what Salvador
was looking at,

00:27:00.012 --> 00:27:04.153
he had a bacteriophage,
and he had two

00:27:04.153 --> 00:27:06.457
strains of bacteria.

00:27:06.457 --> 00:27:09.107
I'll call them A and B.

00:27:09.107 --> 00:27:12.893
OK, here
comes the experiment that

00:27:12.893 --> 00:27:15.815
founded the biotech industry.

00:27:15.815 --> 00:27:17.125
You ready?

00:27:17.125 --> 00:27:19.066
You going to fund me?

00:27:19.066 --> 00:27:23.875
All right, so what I propose
doing is I'm going to

00:27:23.875 --> 00:27:29.690
grow the phage on strain A,
and now I'm going to plate on

00:27:29.690 --> 00:27:32.431
strain
A and strain B.

00:27:32.431 --> 00:27:36.887
I laid awake all last week
thinking

00:27:36.887 --> 00:27:38.576
of this experiment.

00:27:38.576 --> 00:27:40.176
So what did I get?

00:27:40.176 --> 00:27:44.976
I got a lot of plaques on
strain A, probably something

00:27:44.976 --> 00:27:48.442
like 10^9 or 10^10 per ml
because that's

00:27:48.442 --> 00:27:53.033
what this phage lysate usually
looks like once you've grown

00:27:53.033 --> 00:27:53.666
them up.

00:27:53.666 --> 00:27:56.697
And
if I plate them over on strain

00:27:56.697 --> 00:28:00.000
B, no phage, maybe an occasional
phage.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:05.148
So, obvioulsy the bacteriophage
can grow fine on strain A.

00:28:05.148 --> 00:28:08.708
It can't
grow on strain B most of the

00:28:08.708 --> 00:28:12.284
time, but some variant has
managed to

00:28:12.284 --> 00:28:15.310
figure out how to grow on
strain B.

00:28:15.310 --> 00:28:18.425
Given our foray into genetics,
I

00:28:18.425 --> 00:28:24.009
think many of you would think,
probably as I suspect Salvador

00:28:24.009 --> 00:28:25.621
did
at the time,

00:28:25.621 --> 00:28:27.376
the thing's mutated.

00:28:27.376 --> 00:28:28.517
It's learned.

00:28:28.517 --> 00:28:33.256
It's made some change
in its genomes that's allowed

00:28:33.256 --> 00:28:35.275
it to grow on strain B.

00:28:35.275 --> 00:28:40.139
So, I wonder if
it learned to grow on strain B,

00:28:40.139 --> 00:28:43.000
could it grow on strain A?

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:51.048
So, basically what he took was
the phage from that experiment,

00:28:51.048 --> 00:28:59.625
and then
he plated them on strain A and

00:28:59.625 --> 00:29:02.000
strain B.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:07.833
And, well, as you might guess,
since it was growing on strain

00:29:07.833 --> 00:29:12.238
B, lots of
plaques, and there were lots of

00:29:12.238 --> 00:29:14.119
plaques over here.

00:29:14.119 --> 00:29:19.056
OK, so it didn't
forget how to grow on strain A.

00:29:19.056 --> 00:29:23.000
So, better check over here,
too, need a

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.705
control experiment,
so take this guy,

00:29:26.705 --> 00:29:30.000
plate it out,
strain A, strain

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.716
B, some plaques over here.

00:29:32.716 --> 00:29:37.000
That's not a surprise going in
strain A.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:40.135
We are back to where we started
from.

00:29:40.135 --> 00:29:43.670
It doesn't sound like a
mutant, does it?

00:29:43.670 --> 00:29:47.799
And if it was a mutant,
everybody should have been

00:29:47.799 --> 00:29:48.504
the same.

00:29:48.504 --> 00:29:53.200
Instead, when you grew a phage
on strain A, it didn't have

00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:55.626
the ability to grow on strain
B.

00:29:55.626 --> 00:29:58.599
But if you gave it a chance to
grow

00:29:58.599 --> 00:30:04.000
on strain B,
most of them wouldn't make it.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:09.645
But if it ever did,
it had now acquired the ability

00:30:09.645 --> 00:30:11.900
to grow on
strain B.

00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:15.000
So it could still grow on both.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:19.724
But if you take somebody who
had been growing,

00:30:19.724 --> 00:30:25.000
something had been growing on
strain A, it lost it.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:30.541
And so, the idea there was then
that it wasn't a mutation.

00:30:30.541 --> 00:30:35.387
Something was
happening in the strain B that

00:30:35.387 --> 00:30:39.000
enabled it to grow on strain B.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:43.221
And if it ever got away from
that environment,

00:30:43.221 --> 00:30:44.253
it lost it.

00:30:44.253 --> 00:30:47.347
So, the
phenomenon was called

00:30:47.347 --> 00:30:48.525
restriction.

00:30:48.525 --> 00:30:50.587
It wasn't a mutation.

00:30:50.587 --> 00:30:53.090
It was
something else.

00:30:53.090 --> 00:30:57.855
And it turned out,
then, that restriction was

00:30:57.855 --> 00:31:00.013
due to an enzyme.

00:31:00.013 --> 00:31:04.453
An example of this kind of
thing,

00:31:04.453 --> 00:31:10.606
then, would be this EcoRI
activity that's able to cut at a

00:31:10.606 --> 00:31:13.190
very
specific sequence.

00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:18.269
Now, if you are going to have a
set of molecular

00:31:18.269 --> 00:31:23.913
scissors inside of you that
could cut at G A T C sequences,

00:31:23.913 --> 00:31:27.482
you'd have
a problem unless you did

00:31:27.482 --> 00:31:32.088
something else because every one
of your G A T

00:31:32.088 --> 00:31:39.000
C sequences would be cut by the
restriction enzymes.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:45.814
So what the cells that have a
restriction enzyme have,

00:31:45.814 --> 00:31:49.250
is a
modification enzyme that

00:31:49.250 --> 00:31:54.428
recognizes the same sequence,
and then modifies

00:31:54.428 --> 00:32:02.142
it in some way that makes it
resistant to the restriction

00:32:02.142 --> 00:32:03.363
enzyme.

00:32:03.363 --> 00:32:09.298
And in the case of the EcoRI,
it

00:32:09.298 --> 00:32:12.451
puts on a methyl group on this
A.

00:32:12.451 --> 00:32:15.898
You might have thought that
that

00:32:15.898 --> 00:32:21.032
would interfere with base
pairing, but it doesn't because

00:32:21.032 --> 00:32:23.499
adenine looks
like this.

00:32:23.499 --> 00:32:28.098
These are the guys that base
pair with thymine,

00:32:28.098 --> 00:32:32.765
if you
look back, and you'll see that

00:32:32.765 --> 00:32:37.252
you could put a methyl
group in there.

00:32:37.252 --> 00:32:41.083
It wouldn't interfere with the
base

00:32:41.083 --> 00:32:43.165
pairing, but would allow this
to go.

00:32:43.165 --> 00:32:45.249
So, it was the discovery of
this

00:32:45.249 --> 00:32:48.753
phenomenon of restriction of
bacteriophage grew on one

00:32:48.753 --> 00:32:50.320
strain,
not on another.

00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:52.856
It could learn to grow on the
other strain.

00:32:52.856 --> 00:32:54.872
It could
lose that acquisition.

00:32:54.872 --> 00:32:56.222
It was that phenomenon.

00:32:56.222 --> 00:32:59.671
People, didn't have any
other reason other than it was

00:32:59.671 --> 00:33:01.915
an interesting problem in
biology

00:33:01.915 --> 00:33:03.204
to understand it.

00:33:03.204 --> 00:33:05.856
Once they understood the basis
of

00:33:05.856 --> 00:33:09.127
it, another whole world opened
up because you could see from

00:33:09.127 --> 00:33:11.398
basic
principles, now I could cut any

00:33:11.398 --> 00:33:12.164
piece of DNA.

00:33:12.164 --> 00:33:15.142
I could generate
these little overhanging sticky

00:33:15.142 --> 00:33:15.441
ends.

00:33:15.441 --> 00:33:16.999
I could take a plasmid.

00:33:16.999 --> 00:33:18.484
People knew about those.

00:33:18.484 --> 00:33:20.712
I could find one that only has
one

00:33:20.712 --> 00:33:21.699
restriction site.

00:33:21.699 --> 00:33:23.092
I could stick things in.

00:33:23.092 --> 00:33:26.385
Now I've attached an
origin of replication to each

00:33:26.385 --> 00:33:27.466
of those pieces.

00:33:27.466 --> 00:33:29.372
And I'm
in business.

00:33:29.372 --> 00:33:33.165
I can now, for the first time
ever,

00:33:33.165 --> 00:33:38.412
take a particular piece of DNA
and make as many copies as I

00:33:38.412 --> 00:33:38.864
want.

00:33:38.864 --> 00:33:41.232
And
that was an absolute

00:33:41.232 --> 00:33:45.829
transformation to the way people
were able to think

00:33:45.829 --> 00:33:47.134
about biology.

00:33:47.134 --> 00:33:52.163
So I'm going to just kind of
give you an idea of how

00:33:52.163 --> 00:33:54.015
people would start.

00:33:54.015 --> 00:33:58.498
So the way people began and
still begin most

00:33:58.498 --> 00:34:03.248
things is they'd call it,
the usual term is you call

00:34:03.248 --> 00:34:07.864
constructing a
recombinant DNA library.

00:34:07.864 --> 00:34:12.666
And there are a variety of
different

00:34:12.666 --> 00:34:15.525
ways of doing this.

00:34:15.525 --> 00:34:20.191
But this principle is the same.

00:34:20.191 --> 00:34:27.281
We'd take
the DNA from whatever organism

00:34:27.281 --> 00:34:33.689
you're interested in,
and studying.

00:34:33.689 --> 00:34:39.856
And we cut with some
restriction

00:34:39.856 --> 00:34:40.606
enzyme.

00:34:40.606 --> 00:34:46.928
And this restriction enzyme
will cut wherever there happened

00:34:46.928 --> 00:34:48.639
to
be sites.

00:34:48.639 --> 00:34:52.080
They might be close together.

00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:55.284
They might be far apart.

00:34:55.284 --> 00:34:59.025
But whatever,
still generate some

00:34:59.025 --> 00:35:03.000
characteristic set of fragments.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.343
And we'll now have,
in this case,

00:35:05.343 --> 00:35:08.199
fragment number one,
fragment number

00:35:08.199 --> 00:35:11.618
two, fragment number three,
fragment number four,

00:35:11.618 --> 00:35:12.330
and so on.

00:35:12.330 --> 00:35:15.108
And if it's
my DNA, there's a lot of

00:35:15.108 --> 00:35:15.820
fragments.

00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:18.599
And of course,
they're all mixed up.

00:35:18.599 --> 00:35:21.089
I can't tell where any of them
are.

00:35:21.089 --> 00:35:23.798
They're just all mixed together
in

00:35:23.798 --> 00:35:24.992
the test tube.

00:35:24.992 --> 00:35:29.000
Then we'll take that vector
that we've opened.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:34.439
And now, we'll mix all of these
fragments together with this

00:35:34.439 --> 00:35:35.362
vector.

00:35:35.362 --> 00:35:40.134
And then we join it just the
way we discussed.

00:35:40.134 --> 00:35:44.959
And now what
we'll get, it's a collection of

00:35:44.959 --> 00:35:48.826
plasmids that have different
inserts.

00:35:48.826 --> 00:35:54.452
So, one of the plasmids will
have that fragment number one.

00:35:54.452 --> 00:35:59.829
Another one of them will have
fragment number two,

00:35:59.829 --> 00:36:02.862
number
three, and so on.

00:36:02.862 --> 00:36:08.464
Then this whole thing is what's
known as a library.

00:36:08.464 --> 00:36:12.498
You can see if it's DNA from
me, there were 3

00:36:12.498 --> 00:36:14.702
billion base pairs to start.

00:36:14.702 --> 00:36:18.164
Given the human DNA,
G A T C sequences are

00:36:18.164 --> 00:36:19.314
pretty common.

00:36:19.314 --> 00:36:23.831
You can calculate the frequency
yourself for how many

00:36:23.831 --> 00:36:28.710
sites on average there would be
for a restriction enzyme within

00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:31.845
a piece
of DNA and figure out roughly

00:36:31.845 --> 00:36:35.164
how the fragments there would be
in the

00:36:35.164 --> 00:36:37.202
library of human DNA.

00:36:37.202 --> 00:36:39.626
So, we are partway there.

00:36:39.626 --> 00:36:41.857
We can
now make a library.

00:36:41.857 --> 00:36:44.214
We can make it from bacterial
DNA.

00:36:44.214 --> 00:36:46.571
We can make it
from human DNA.

00:36:46.571 --> 00:36:50.500
But the next thing that people
had to learn how to do

00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:55.500
was to figure out how to find a
particular fragment that had the

00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:57.536
gene that you are interested
in.

00:36:57.536 --> 00:37:00.045
And there's a whole variety of
things.

00:37:00.045 --> 00:37:03.114
I mean, ultimately today since
the human genome is sequenced,

00:37:03.114 --> 00:37:05.844
you go on a computer and type
and you find it because the

00:37:05.844 --> 00:37:07.028
sequence is
all known.

00:37:07.028 --> 00:37:09.938
But the only reason we can do
that is because of all the

00:37:09.938 --> 00:37:11.380
work that was done in between.

00:37:11.380 --> 00:37:13.351
So, I'll give you several ways
of doing

00:37:13.351 --> 00:37:13.601
this.

00:37:13.601 --> 00:37:16.160
But one of the ways I think you
can see very easily,

00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:18.586
and it's
actually going back to the term

00:37:18.586 --> 00:37:19.527
complementation.

00:37:19.527 --> 00:37:20.966
Remember
complementation?

00:37:20.966 --> 00:37:23.586
We had something that was
mutant, and then we'd put

00:37:23.586 --> 00:37:27.000
in a wild type gene,
and fixed it up again.

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:30.042
So, for example,
suppose I was studying

00:37:30.042 --> 00:37:32.435
histidine biosynthesis in
E.

00:37:32.435 --> 00:37:36.814
coli, and I wanted to find the
gene that encoded the enzyme

00:37:36.814 --> 00:37:39.469
that I
had just disabled in my

00:37:39.469 --> 00:37:41.369
histidine minus mutant.

00:37:41.369 --> 00:37:43.944
So, if I have a
his auxotroph,

00:37:43.944 --> 00:37:46.819
I'll call it a hisG gene,
for example,

00:37:46.819 --> 00:37:50.737
that's one of
the genes involved in making

00:37:50.737 --> 00:37:51.664
histidine.

00:37:51.664 --> 00:37:54.895
So, since it's a
histidine auxotroph,

00:37:54.895 --> 00:37:58.052
if I have it on just minimal
glucose plates,

00:37:58.052 --> 00:38:00.660
and I
streak it out,

00:38:00.660 --> 00:38:04.000
it's not going to grow.

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:08.623
But if I grow it on minimal
glucose plus histidine,

00:38:08.623 --> 00:38:12.284
then it will be able
to grow, right?

00:38:12.284 --> 00:38:16.272
So, I've got a variant of this
organism.

00:38:16.272 --> 00:38:20.615
It's got
a single mutation in it that's

00:38:20.615 --> 00:38:22.588
affecting one gene.

00:38:22.588 --> 00:38:27.331
And because I
don't have that gene,

00:38:27.331 --> 00:38:31.000
I can't grow on minimal.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:34.881
If I made a library of E.
coli DNA, which is going to

00:38:34.881 --> 00:38:37.460
have a lot of
fragments as well,

00:38:37.460 --> 00:38:41.152
and I took that library and I
put it into this

00:38:41.152 --> 00:38:44.666
mutant, I'm going to get a big
mess of things,

00:38:44.666 --> 00:38:48.542
all the different
plasmids with all the different

00:38:48.542 --> 00:38:51.304
fragments that go into that
mutant.

00:38:51.304 --> 00:38:54.308
How am I going to find the one
that I want?

00:38:54.308 --> 00:38:55.523
Anybody see that?

00:38:55.523 --> 00:38:57.087
It's not
that hard.

00:38:57.087 --> 00:38:58.145
I'm the mutant.

00:38:58.145 --> 00:39:01.460
I can't grow on minimal because
I can't make

00:39:01.460 --> 00:39:02.874
this enzyme.

00:39:02.874 --> 00:39:07.000
Therefore, I can't make
histidine.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:08.323
What do I need?

00:39:08.323 --> 00:39:12.205
How could you fix me up if you
were a doctor?

00:39:12.205 --> 00:39:15.718
What's
the gene we want out of here?

00:39:15.718 --> 00:39:19.000
The one that makes that
particular

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.400
enzyme that makes histidine.

00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:25.000
Yeah, take the whole library,
stick it in

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:26.090
this mutant.

00:39:26.090 --> 00:39:30.090
If the gene coming in encodes
DNA polymerase,

00:39:30.090 --> 00:39:33.429
I'm not
going to help this guy.

00:39:33.429 --> 00:39:37.443
It still won't grow in minimal,
take

00:39:37.443 --> 00:39:43.233
a gene involved in making part
of the cell wall won't help.

00:39:43.233 --> 00:39:47.382
But if I
put in the, I get a fragment of

00:39:47.382 --> 00:39:51.219
DNA that includes the hisG plus
gene,

00:39:51.219 --> 00:39:55.334
and I put it in here,
it's going to grow up.

00:39:55.334 --> 00:40:01.494
If it has the plasmid that
has, or let's say the vector

00:40:01.494 --> 00:40:05.000
that has the hisG plus gene.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:07.235
So what you've done is a
really, sort of,

00:40:07.235 --> 00:40:10.493
you've used that principle
of complementation that some of

00:40:10.493 --> 00:40:12.711
you were sort of wondering about
when we

00:40:12.711 --> 00:40:13.955
were doing genetics.

00:40:13.955 --> 00:40:15.946
So, you'd break a copy of a
gene.

00:40:15.946 --> 00:40:17.800
In the
things we talked about,

00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:20.425
we bring in a whole chromosome
that included in

00:40:20.425 --> 00:40:22.497
it just a wild type copy of the
gene.

00:40:22.497 --> 00:40:24.282
With recombinant DNA,
we can

00:40:24.282 --> 00:40:26.419
really narrow it down in the
extreme.

00:40:26.419 --> 00:40:30.552
We can bring in a piece of
DNA that is only the gene

00:40:30.552 --> 00:40:32.000
that's broken.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:35.089
And we can take the gene back
to the wild type.

00:40:35.089 --> 00:40:37.691
One thing, just to
close, you'll see,

00:40:37.691 --> 00:40:41.000
if you remember back when I
talked about language

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:44.101
that are not universal,
although the genetic code is

00:40:44.101 --> 00:40:46.721
universal, promoters
and things are not.

00:40:46.721 --> 00:40:50.000
So I couldn't ever do this with
a human DNA, could

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.655
I, because it wouldn't get
expressed.

00:40:52.655 --> 00:40:56.403
So, we need some other
ways of finding those.

00:40:56.403 --> 00:40:59.469
We'll talk about those on the
next lecture, OK?
