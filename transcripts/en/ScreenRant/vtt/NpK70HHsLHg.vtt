00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.690
In an action film the list of stunt men and
women can go longer than the list of credits

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:11.860
for actors.

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.690
These roles are important to the safety of
the cast and crew but sometimes movie stars

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.820
want to perform their own stunts.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:24.090
These stunts can go terrible wrong and cause
long-term damage to the stars but nonetheless

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.410
they continue to want to perform them.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:30.099
Sometimes these stunt could be a simple turn
around that anyone of us can do but when you’re

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:32.730
on a film set things can get dangerous.

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.540
Get ready to like Screen Rant’s list of
ten Movie Stunts That Weren't Suppose To Go

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.460
Horribly Wrong.

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:41.920
Bruce Willis in Die Hard

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.620
This action packed film that spawned a holiday
movie-watching tradition, almost made Bruce

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:47.620
Willis deaf.

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.860
After Alan Rickman’s Hans Gruber and gang
took over the Nakatomi corporation building

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:57.480
one man stood in the way of them stealing
$640 million in bearer bonds, Willis’ John

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.480
McClane.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.230
When Willis fired a gun, the sound of the
gun going off was compressed due to his location

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:03.230
under a desk.

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.909
He went deaf in one ear, only getting back
45% of his hearing.

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:11.990
It must not have fazed Willis since he keeps
making Die Hard sequels.

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.420
Charlize Theron in Aeon Flux

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.360
Charlize Theron has given her all for her
films, which is why she has an Oscar and has

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.490
starred in some awesome action films.

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.700
While performing in Aeon Flux, Theron knew
her role would be physical and she felt she

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.890
was prepared due to her training as a professional
ballet dancer.

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.979
While performing a back handspring Theron
came down on her neck and sustained a spinal

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.330
disc herniation and massive nerve damage.

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.810
Five days in the hospital and weeks of physical
therapy taught Theron to leave the more difficult

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.130
stunts to her stunt doubles.

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.870
Jackie Chan in Armour of God

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:47.640
You are probably not surprised that Jackie
Chan is on this list but the surprise is he

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.439
won’t stop performing stunts and honestly
we don’t want him to.

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:56.390
Chan has slide down the side of a skyscraper,
free fell 60 feet and has even been hit by

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.150
a helicopter in flight.

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:03.250
Still his worst injury came in 1991’s Armour
of God with a stunt that wasn’t nearly as

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:04.250
dangerous.

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.200
He was supposed to jump from a slope and into
a tree but he missed and hit his head on a

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.390
rock, causing a piece of his skull to go into
his brain.

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:19.000
That must’ve been the part of the brain
that enhances fear because Chan knows no fear.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.040
Diane Kruger in Inglorious Bastards

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.060
The Inglourious Basterds recruit German film
star Bridget von Hammersmark, played by Diane

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:31.150
Kruger, to infiltrate a movie premiere in
an attempt to kill Hitler and other top Nazi

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.150
officials.

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.510
Sadly Kruger’s character is killed before
the deed is finished in a realistic strangulation

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:37.510
scene.

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.249
That’s because the director Quentin Tarrantino
convinced Kruger to be strangled-for real!

00:02:41.249 --> 00:02:44.980
Realistic, yes but he could’ve given her
a chance to try acting before cutting off

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.639
her air supply in that dangerous stunt.

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:50.659
Steve Carell in The 40 Year Old Virgin

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:54.249
One of the most memorable scenes from The
40 Year Old Virgin is when Steve Carell gets

00:02:54.249 --> 00:02:55.689
his chest waxed.

00:02:55.689 --> 00:02:59.989
Some can say this isn’t a stunt but normally
close ups would be shot by a stunt double

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:01.200
and not the lead actor.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.200
Carell decided it would be funnier if he got
waxed himself and not have a stunt double

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.249
take his place.

00:03:06.249 --> 00:03:11.129
The director used four cameras to ensure no
retakes would be needed because he knew Carell

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:12.360
wouldn’t want to do it again.

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:17.199
We are thankful Carell decided to become a
Man O’Lantern!

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:19.340
Halle Berry in Many Of Her Films

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.220
Halle Berry is not someone you want to stand
near while working on a movie set.

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.709
She has had multiple injuries on multiple
films and seems to not be getting any better.

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:32.219
While filming Gothika she broke her arm, then
on the set of Catwoman she hit her head on

00:03:32.219 --> 00:03:34.579
a lighting rig, but it doesn’t stop there.

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:39.129
She broke her foot on Cloud Atlas and during
the film, The Call she smacked her head on

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:40.129
the floor.

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:44.159
Still, her most embarrassing moment came from
the film Die Another Day when she choked on

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:46.650
a fig during a sex scene with Pierce Bronson.

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.749
Yes, we said fig, get your mind out of the
gutter.

00:03:50.749 --> 00:03:53.480
Michael J. Fox in Back to the Future Part
III

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.719
After three Back to the Future films you would
think Michael J. Fox would be used to his

00:03:57.719 --> 00:04:00.129
Marty character being harassed by the Tannen’s.

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:04.620
Yet, during the filming of Back to the Future
Part III he almost lost his life.

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.829
In the scene where Mad Dog Tannen hanged him,
he decided to perform his own stunt.

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:14.349
In rehearsals all went well but when it came
time to the actually shoot he was asphyxiated

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:15.849
and lost consciousness.

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:20.530
No one realized it until a crewmember realized
his acting was a little too good and they

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:23.030
luckily cut him down.

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:26.170
Jennifer Lawrence in The Hunger Games: Mockingjay
– Part 1

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:29.880
She’s one of the hardest working actresses
in Hollywood and she demands the same pay

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.210
as her male co-stars.

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.700
That’s because she deserve it.

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.160
Not only does she bring in the ticket sales
but during the making of The Hunger Games:

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.350
Mockingjay – Part 1 she was injured twice.

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.810
During training she ran into a wall injuring
herself and when filming with a smoke machine

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.090
the machine broke and she was covered in smoke.

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:51.790
She almost choked to death but luckily she
survived and had no permanent injuries.

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:53.700
Jeremy Renner in The Avengers

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:58.620
Jeremy Renner opted out of using a stunt man
for many of the action scenes in "The Avengers."

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.090
In the shot where he jumped from a two-story
building, turned and shoot a bow and arrow

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.750
toward the camera-it was actually Renner.

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:08.760
His impressive skills were used throughout
the film until he turned the wrong way during

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:10.650
a fight and blew out his back.

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:14.870
This injury is still with him today and now
he looks for a stunt double to take his place

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:17.480
in the more aggressive scenes.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:20.990
Harrison Ford in Star Wars: Episode VII – The
Force Awakens

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:25.750
Harrison Ford has survived a plane crash and
the wrath of a movie prop all in the same

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:26.750
year.

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:31.130
When the Millennium Falcon’s door landed
on then 71-year-old Ford, it broke his leg

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:33.350
and caused other severe injuries.

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:38.450
The studio responsible was fined 2 million
dollars, even though Ford wasn’t upset at

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:39.450
all.

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:42.870
He was joking and trying to keep others calm
as he waited for them to lift the door off

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:43.870
him.

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:46.720
They should have called Chewbacca over to
help!

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.370
