JONATHAN ROCHELLE: OK,
I'm Jonathan Rochelle.

00:00:01.874 --> 00:00:03.970
I'm director of product
management at Google.

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:06.455
And I co-founded a company
called 2Web Technologies.

00:00:06.455 --> 00:00:08.330
This was back in 2003.

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:10.290
And 2Web Technologies
actually made

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.580
a product that converted
spreadsheets to web apps.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.450
It took spreadsheets
that you had locally

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:18.658
and turned them into web
apps, and that was important

00:00:18.658 --> 00:00:19.410
back then.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.920
But in about 2005, we joined
Google to start a product

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.940
that you now as Google Sheets.

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.120
And that started a long journey
of me leading the product

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.559
team to develop Google Docs,
Google Sheets, Slides, Forms,

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:34.100
Apps Script, a couple
of other things

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.351
you know or you don't know.

00:00:35.351 --> 00:00:36.850
I know some of you
know Apps Script.

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.650
I see actually some t-shirts I
haven't seen in quite a while,

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:41.000
even.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.800
So today we'll be talking
about something else, which

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.050
is workflows between apps,
and something that's actually

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.390
probably near and dear
to your heart every day,

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.750
which is copy and paste.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.100
So first let's quickly go back.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.516
I want to go back
in time and just

00:00:54.516 --> 00:00:57.020
talk about where some of
the historic relevance

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.200
came from for productivity apps.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.040
So you might not
remember a VisiCalc.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.760
VisiCalc was an incredible
innovation, right?

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.267
And this is an excerpt
from an article or an ad

00:01:09.267 --> 00:01:10.850
that VisiCalc had
where they called it

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.380
a magic sheet of paper that
can perform calculations

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:15.360
and recalculations.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.244
That's how they described it.

00:01:17.244 --> 00:01:19.160
They don't even mention
the word spreadsheets.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.970
It's not even there.

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.860
But what was important
there is that it

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.280
was an app that took something
that was really mundane.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.345
People back then were using
calculators and paper.

00:01:30.345 --> 00:01:31.845
How many people
have heard of paper?

00:01:31.845 --> 00:01:33.940
A few of you.

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.020
Basically, you're
taking calculations

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.800
on a calculator--
which in its own right

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.860
was an advance at some point--
taking that data over to paper.

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.760
And so VisiCalc took away
that mundane act, basically,

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.760
of taking the data
from a calculator

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.180
and scribing it into paper
and put it all in one place.

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.000
And just that, taking the data
and putting it in one place,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.440
it gave people a power and
a feeling of productivity.

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:58.940
The abilities that
they can get done

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.420
using the computer for what
the computer was good at.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.130
And then, of course,
like over decades,

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.210
I don't know, two or three
decades or more, new products

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.070
like that came out-- word
processors, slideware, more

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.830
spreadsheets.

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.095
And they get incrementally,
quote, "better."

00:02:13.095 --> 00:02:15.880
More-- more
features, more things

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.110
that fewer groups of people
would use, more edge cases.

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.350
But the basic value
didn't change.

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:22.930
It was using the
computer to make

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.150
an individual's job easier,
to make their life easier.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.630
But still, one
fundamental need still

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.280
existed, which was
getting information

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.860
from one place to another.

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.620
And today, people
spend their whole day

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:34.790
in products like this.

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.360
We came along and we did
something that, of course,

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.870
we're very proud of.

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.690
We started focusing on teams,
team productivity, and so

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.920
real-time collaboration and
real mobile experiences.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.270
It really changed the world
for us even at Google,

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.830
and it started changing the
way people worked as teams

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:53.960
and focusing on
team collaboration.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.310
So things like charting,
automatic charting

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:58.860
in Google Sheets.

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.560
It adds an incredible value
of collaborator, which

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.490
is the machine, to your team.

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:07.910
And it allows you to identify
anomalies in your data

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:09.840
really quickly.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:10.984
Voice typing.

00:03:10.984 --> 00:03:12.400
Voice typing lets
you get the data

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.980
into the product really easily.

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.770
You can speak and it
really transcribes.

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:17.610
And it's incredibly accurate.

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.540
I know students that
use this all the time.

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:25.400
But still, even with those
advances, we love our products,

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.710
but still this one thing
exists, copy paste.

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:31.580
That's how people get
data from one to another.

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.760
Today, I probably used
it four times already

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.370
this morning just on my
phone getting data from one

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.990
to another.

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:39.930
And that horrible moment,
that face-palm moment

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.560
where you realize you just
copied over the other thing

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.220
that you copied,
and now you pasted

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.950
and you lost the first thing you
copied, so you have to go back.

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:48.770
It's done constantly.

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:50.730
Getting information
from one to another

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.820
relies on our
customers remembering

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:57.669
those awesome short cuts,
Control-C and Control-V.

00:03:57.669 --> 00:03:59.960
That's what separates the
techies from the non-techies,

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.300
as far as they're concerned.

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.970
So when we started
working on this problem--

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.390
even as a startup, but
at Google as well--

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:10.540
we wanted to solve something
different, the team

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:11.580
productivity problem.

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.670
That was a much more
important modern problem.

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.520
It wasn't just
individual productivity.

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.418
It wasn't just more features,
but teams working better

00:04:18.418 --> 00:04:19.459
together to achieve more.

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.209
That's what was important to us.

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:24.550
And we're trying to take
teams beyond productivity,

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.470
focusing on their
goals and their impact.

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.380
So now where do you fit in?

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.730
Developers, people
that have other apps.

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:34.280
We realize, of
course, that people

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:35.680
aren't just in Google Apps.

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:36.870
They're in other products.

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.280
And they need to get
information from those products

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.580
to our products, and from
our product to yours.

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.900
And that's super
important to us.

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.510
So whether you spend
time in your CRM,

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:50.200
or your ERP, or your
project management tool,

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.070
you're trying to get data
in between those products,

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.270
across those products,
across those silos.

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.130
So those silos of
information are

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:02.552
what now creates these gaps
in efficiency and lets teams,

00:05:02.552 --> 00:05:04.260
instead of working
really well and having

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.580
magical experiences in
our apps and in your apps,

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.060
it breaks the model.

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:11.390
So we're trying to fix that.

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:13.860
We're trying to get
rid of, basically,

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.990
those unmagical
moments of copy paste.

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:22.050
So we're here today to
talk to you about new APIs.

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:24.850
And the APIs are across
some of our products,

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:27.470
and we're going to try
basically to kill copy paste.

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:28.820
That's our goal today.

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:32.230
And if we can do that,
I think we've achieved.

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:33.783
So to talk about
how this works, I'm

00:05:33.783 --> 00:05:35.170
going to invite Tom up to start.

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:36.878
He's going to talk to
you about some APIs

00:05:36.878 --> 00:05:38.394
that we have in Google Sheets.

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:48.190
TOM HOLMAN: Thanks, Jonathan.

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:48.960
Hi everyone.

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.350
My name's Tom Holman and
I'm a product manager

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:53.120
for Google Sheets.

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.560
And over the next
several minutes,

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.080
my colleague Ajay
and I are going

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.710
to talk to you about how
the Google Docs editors

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:02.910
teams developed new APIs to
help break down those silo walls

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:05.320
that you heard
about from Jonathan.

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.520
I want to start off by
talking you through just

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.830
the three main design
goals we had in mind

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:13.020
when we were
developing these APIs.

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:16.730
So first, we were really focused
on making it easy for you

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:20.370
as developers to build on top
of the Google Docs editors.

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:22.860
What this meant to us is
we wanted to make sure

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:26.230
it was just a very
simple, single API request

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:28.920
if you wanted to replace
a range of data in sheets

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:32.380
or swap out a string in a slide.

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:36.000
Second, the Google Docs
editors, as JR told you,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.750
are built around the
concept of collaboration,

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:41.160
and have been since day one.

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.570
So it was important to
us that any solution

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:47.380
that we give to developers
really respects collaboration.

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:50.680
And so if you look at the design
of these APIs, what you'll see

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.090
is that they're structured
around the concept of batch

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:54.080
updates.

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.450
So a user, when they look
in the revision history

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:59.680
for their document, they'll
see single batched updates

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:02.790
of the changes that a
developer might have made.

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:05.340
And if a user happens to be
collaborating in the document

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:07.850
when, as a developer,
you make a change,

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:12.160
they'll see a smooth experience
instead of a jarring change.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.680
And then finally, we
recognize the importance

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.600
of giving you as
developers access

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:18.980
to the most powerful
features and functionality

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:20.640
within our products.

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:23.460
We realized to really break
down those silo walls,

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:27.130
we had to give you
access to this power.

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:29.120
So with those
principles in mind,

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:32.314
let's jump into Google Sheets.

00:07:32.314 --> 00:07:34.480
And I want to start talking
about Sheets by actually

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:37.270
reminding you that we've
had a public API for Sheets

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:40.880
for several years
now, the GData API.

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:43.330
And this is how developers--
and I see some folks laughing

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:44.750
in the crowd about GData.

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:47.690
This is how third party
developers have integrated

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:49.710
with Sheets over the years.

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:51.790
But there's a
problem with GData.

00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:53.910
And that problem is
it really only lets

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:56.730
you read and write cell data.

00:07:56.730 --> 00:07:58.970
And for anyone who's ever
opened Google Sheets,

00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:01.090
you know there's a whole
lot more to the product

00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:04.660
than just the values
you're storing in cells.

00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:07.360
Which is why I'm excited to
tell you that just yesterday,

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:09.120
we launched a brand
new Google Sheets

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:13.150
API that gives you much more of
the richness of the product--

00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:15.040
things that developers
like yourselves

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:17.360
have been asking
us for for years.

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:19.370
I'm talking about
programmatic access

00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:23.040
to filters and conditional
formatting, pivot tables,

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:24.630
and charts.

00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:30.830
So the question really
becomes, if we've given you

00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:34.590
a cloud-based document format
and programmatic access

00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:37.380
to the most powerful
features with our products,

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:41.600
what are the things that you as
developers can really do now?

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:43.909
So what I want to do over
the next couple minutes is,

00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:46.080
with the help of two
partners who have given us

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:48.882
early feedback in the design
and development of this API,

00:08:48.882 --> 00:08:53.430
is show you just two
types of use cases.

00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:55.880
So the first use case I
want to talk with you about

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:57.680
is reporting.

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:00.600
We've heard from developers
that building reporting is

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:04.270
really painful, and it's
painful for a couple reasons.

00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:07.900
The first is it's
painful to build.

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:09.430
It takes a lot of work.

00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:12.310
And once you've even
developed reporting,

00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:14.450
users actually want to
customize it anyway.

00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:17.590
So they end up downloading
the CSV from your report,

00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:20.700
uploading it into a spreadsheet,
and building their own analysis

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:22.510
on top of it.

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:26.510
We realized by giving you
a cloud-based spreadsheet

00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:28.600
in an associated
API, you can actually

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:31.760
do this and automate
the process for users.

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:34.130
So you can generate
a spreadsheet pushing

00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:36.740
your live data, build
analysis, and charts,

00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:39.030
and so on top of it for a user.

00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:41.680
The user can open the
document and customize it.

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:44.270
And then you can actually
refresh the underlying data

00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:46.960
in the user's
customized analysis.

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:48.900
To show you what
this looks like,

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:51.490
I'd like to invite Owen
McQuaide, strategic partner

00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:53.231
manager from SAP
Anywhere to the stage

00:09:53.231 --> 00:09:54.355
to show you an integration.

00:09:58.600 --> 00:09:59.760
OWEN MCQUAIDE: Thanks, Tom.

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:02.030
Thanks.

00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:04.260
First of all, I'd like
to say it's absolutely

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:05.200
wonderful to be here.

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:09.580
Because not only are we a launch
partner for the new Google

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:12.310
Sheets API, but
it's actually also

00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:16.590
the launch week for
SAP Anywhere in the US.

00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:20.380
So you'll be amongst the
first to see both of them.

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:22.670
Let me tell you a little
about SAP Anywhere.

00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:26.750
It's targeted at small to
medium size businesses.

00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:30.120
And it's aimed at
addressing the key pain

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:34.670
points of social marketing
and digital commerce.

00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:39.760
It's an end-to-end fully
integrated digital solution.

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:43.870
And we, with the open APIs
that we have at the moment,

00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:46.460
have integrated with a
number of other partners

00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:50.370
who offer social marketing,
and marketplaces,

00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:54.890
and of course now, Google
for the reporting side.

00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:56.690
It's mobile first.

00:10:56.690 --> 00:11:00.210
So in other words, an SME
can run their entire business

00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:02.460
from a mobile device.

00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:07.170
It's also web and
cloud and app based.

00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:11.180
And so it's incredibly
easy and intuitive to use.

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:14.860
We aim to deploy it
in under 40 hours.

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:21.440
Reporting is a major concern and
a key driver in any business.

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:25.560
And it's key-- from
our point of view

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:28.370
anyway-- because of the various
markets that we operate across

00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:33.630
from China to, now, the US, that
users have flexible reporting

00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:36.910
that they're able to change,
and we can offer them

00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:40.430
detailed and in-depth analysis.

00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:44.120
So with the Google
Sheets API, that

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:49.130
offers us the ability to
offer that flexibility

00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:52.360
to be able to provide
that in-depth analysis,

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:55.670
but on a continuing basis
to keep that information up

00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:56.580
to date.

00:11:56.580 --> 00:12:00.810
Let's take a look
at the software.

00:12:00.810 --> 00:12:03.130
So that's the home
screen that a user

00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:06.880
would see with various
shortcuts pinned onto the home

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:08.850
screen in SAP Anywhere.

00:12:08.850 --> 00:12:12.120
So if we run the
sales analysis report,

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:14.590
that's the standard
sales analysis

00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:17.870
report that would be output
by the reporting engine.

00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:22.420
It's not as flexible in
terms of providing analysis,

00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:25.120
and of course,
users may be tempted

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:28.030
to get it into a spreadsheet
using cut and paste,

00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:31.491
the dreaded, dark copy paste.

00:12:31.491 --> 00:12:33.380
So we've built in
a function here

00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:35.900
to actually export that
using the new Google Sheets

00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:39.190
API into Sheets.

00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:42.110
So we pop in a name here,
it's as simple as that.

00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:45.110
Pop in a name, sales
analysis report.

00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:48.690
We can check there the
Automatically Synchronize

00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:49.190
option.

00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:53.260
So that allows us to pass
new updates and any changes

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.510
to the information
across into Sheets

00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:59.010
without the user having
to move it manually.

00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:01.720
So it just takes a second
to move that through.

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:03.340
But what's exciting
about it is it

00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:07.620
doesn't only generate
a data extract.

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:10.830
It's actually a complex report.

00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:12.480
In fact, it's got
virtually everything

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:16.210
available to Sheets users
available through the API.

00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:18.530
So we're able to produce charts.

00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:21.330
Those are based on a pivot
table that we've also

00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:25.420
generated through our reporting
engine and through the API.

00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:27.800
And that's based on
another sheet there,

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:29.760
you've got the raw data itself.

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:31.550
So Tom, if you make
a change to that,

00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:35.840
I want to show you how using the
new Explore feature in Sheets,

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:39.760
how if we add and
make a change to it,

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:47.020
those changes aren't overwritten
when the chart's updated.

00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:49.370
So if we move back
into SAP Anywhere,

00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:52.700
in the interest of time, we've
got a relatively short time,

00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:54.650
we're going to
trigger the change.

00:13:54.650 --> 00:13:58.590
You can normally have--
change is this month-- where

00:13:58.590 --> 00:14:01.629
you can set it to
updates on a weekly,

00:14:01.629 --> 00:14:03.670
and for some of our users,
it's more appropriate,

00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:06.310
and for some reports to
have them monthly updated,

00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:08.400
and to make them
available through Drive

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:11.290
and to share them
collaboratively.

00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:13.130
So if we put that,
we'll flip back,

00:14:13.130 --> 00:14:15.410
and I want to show
you how it changes

00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:20.970
and how quickly that's
passed through into Sheets.

00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:24.270
If we move back
to the slide, Tom,

00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:28.790
we're really excited about this
integration and the flexibility

00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:30.584
that it offers our customers.

00:14:30.584 --> 00:14:32.000
We're looking
forward to making it

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.110
available in the
coming next few months.

00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:37.172
Great, thanks.

00:14:37.172 --> 00:14:39.532
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:47.870
TOM HOLMAN: Thank you, Owen.

00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:49.710
So that was reporting.

00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:51.670
So we've also heard
from developers

00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:54.930
that users often struggle
when it comes to updating data

00:14:54.930 --> 00:14:57.610
in bulk in your applications.

00:14:57.610 --> 00:15:00.030
But this happens to actually
be the type of use case

00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:01.640
that a product
like Google Sheets

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:03.875
is really well suited to.

00:15:03.875 --> 00:15:06.520
So to show off how
this works, I'd

00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:10.662
like to invite Tom McCleary
from Salesforce to the stage.

00:15:10.662 --> 00:15:13.092
[APPLAUSE]

00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:17.110
TOM MCCLEARY: Thanks, Tom.

00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:19.429
I, too, am very
excited to be here.

00:15:19.429 --> 00:15:21.220
We've been a long time
partner with Google,

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:22.928
and we've done a lot
of different things,

00:15:22.928 --> 00:15:24.970
particularly with
Google for Work.

00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:28.060
And this integration is
one of the coolest things

00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:31.230
we've worked on in a long time.

00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:33.060
As you guys are well
aware, Salesforce,

00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:37.020
we do a lot around sales
automation, customer service.

00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:39.150
And our particular
use case is really

00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:41.740
kind of taking a
look at how, when

00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:44.500
I'm dealing with large
volumes of transactions,

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:47.130
do I make it easy
in one place to be

00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:51.460
able to update, modify, without
having to go into each record?

00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:55.770
And the value of this really
comes kind of on a weekly basis

00:15:55.770 --> 00:16:00.350
whenever you're rolling up your
opportunities into a forecast

00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:01.290
report.

00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:04.050
And so a sales
manager, a sales rep

00:16:04.050 --> 00:16:08.630
with a lot of transactions, this
becomes kind of a pain point.

00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:13.570
So the partnership with Google
with the new Google Sheets API

00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:15.800
gives us incredible
power to make

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:18.570
it very easy for our
customers and users

00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:22.350
to interact between the
two worlds seamlessly.

00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:27.970
So with that, let's
jump into the demo.

00:16:27.970 --> 00:16:30.780
So on my right, your
left-- hopefully

00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:33.330
I got this right-- you'll be
seeing a Salesforce opportunity

00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:34.570
list.

00:16:34.570 --> 00:16:38.220
On my left, your right,
you'll be seeing a spreadsheet

00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:40.320
that represents that.

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:44.870
And so we're going to go in
and show you exactly how easy

00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:45.370
it is.

00:16:45.370 --> 00:16:49.620
So Tom, if you can look at edge
SLA and change to close one,

00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:51.050
and maybe change
the probability.

00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:58.090
What you'll see instantaneously
over on your left

00:16:58.090 --> 00:17:00.940
is an update that shows
it's closed one and 100%

00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:03.285
[APPLAUSE]

00:17:06.025 --> 00:17:07.400
And just because
we want to prove

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:08.941
this isn't a cheap
party trick, we're

00:17:08.941 --> 00:17:10.579
going to do it another time.

00:17:10.579 --> 00:17:12.520
And Tom's going to
update another record

00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:13.520
and shift the amount.

00:17:17.089 --> 00:17:18.369
Guide was sandbagging.

00:17:18.369 --> 00:17:19.099
He upped it.

00:17:22.410 --> 00:17:24.010
Yeah, exactly.

00:17:24.010 --> 00:17:27.390
Close one and 100%.

00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:30.440
Now, the power of this
comes in many levels.

00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:35.360
This is the beauty of good code.

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:38.580
It all seems easy and seamless,
but it's incredibly fine

00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:39.470
grained.

00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:41.100
And so when you're
in Salesforce,

00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:43.160
you don't want to
corrupt your data,

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:45.150
you don't want silly
things happening,

00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:46.590
so you have complete control.

00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:50.990
And so Tom will try to overwrite
the ID here, and he can't.

00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:53.470
And all of this stuff
that you're seeing here,

00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:57.000
we like to call them
kind of click APIs.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.040
Because all of this conditional
formatting, based upon the fact

00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:04.010
that if it's below 50%,
it's red, if it's above 90%,

00:18:04.010 --> 00:18:07.350
it's green, all of that
just happens automatically

00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:09.010
from the integration.

00:18:09.010 --> 00:18:12.290
So the power of the API and
the power of the two solutions

00:18:12.290 --> 00:18:16.240
together really drive huge
value and ease of use.

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:19.440
And I think the whole thing of
what good developers try to do

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:21.940
is make it easy for our users.

00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:25.000
This is really the easy
button for our users.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.123
With that, I'll
give it back to Tom.

00:18:27.123 --> 00:18:28.247
TOM HOLMAN: Thank you, Tom.

00:18:28.247 --> 00:18:30.682
[APPLAUSE]

00:18:38.490 --> 00:18:41.750
So this new API just launched
with all documentation

00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:46.020
in the API available through
developers.google.com/sheets.

00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:48.020
For the folks who want
to get their hands dirty,

00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:50.260
we also have a codelab
available at the kiosks

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:52.460
around I/O and online.

00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:55.770
We're excited to see what
you build with this new API.

00:18:55.770 --> 00:18:58.610
And with that, I'd like to
hand off to my colleague Ajay

00:18:58.610 --> 00:19:00.650
to talk with you about Slides.

00:19:00.650 --> 00:19:03.016
[APPLAUSE]

00:19:06.370 --> 00:19:09.960
AJAY SURIE: All right, morning.

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:12.520
My name is Ajay Surie,
and I'm a product manager

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:14.460
for Google Slides.

00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:16.910
One of the top requests that
we've heard from many of you

00:19:16.910 --> 00:19:20.660
developers is the ability to
create and update presentations

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:22.630
programmatically.

00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:24.720
That's why I'm excited
to announce that we've

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:27.520
been working on exactly
this problem, a brand

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:30.500
new API for Google Slides.

00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:35.300
As Tom outlined earlier, this
API will also be easy to use,

00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:38.570
it will work seamlessly with
Docs' real time collaboration,

00:19:38.570 --> 00:19:40.200
and it'll give you
programmatic access

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:43.190
to all the powerful
features of Slides.

00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:45.010
So just like we did
with Sheets, we're

00:19:45.010 --> 00:19:46.580
going to jump into
two integrations

00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:48.954
that our partners have built
to give you a flavor of what

00:19:48.954 --> 00:19:51.480
you'll be able to do.

00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:55.490
The first example is around
creating presentable reports.

00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:57.230
We've heard from
many of our users

00:19:57.230 --> 00:20:00.560
that when they work with
data on another application,

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:02.880
they often want to share
this with their team

00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:04.100
or with their boss.

00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:06.070
But they don't just want
to share the raw data,

00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:07.890
they want it to look good.

00:20:07.890 --> 00:20:10.330
And well, this involves,
you guessed it,

00:20:10.330 --> 00:20:13.050
a lot of copying, and
pasting, and formatting.

00:20:13.050 --> 00:20:15.150
So we're going to
make that go away.

00:20:15.150 --> 00:20:17.290
In this example,
you'll see how you

00:20:17.290 --> 00:20:21.000
can use the API to export
data from another application

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.250
into Slides to create
a polished report.

00:20:24.250 --> 00:20:27.690
And to show you this, I'd like
to invite Hamid from Trello

00:20:27.690 --> 00:20:28.532
up to the stage.

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:34.590
HAMID PALO: Hi, everybody.

00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:36.144
I'm Hamid from
Trello, and I'm here

00:20:36.144 --> 00:20:37.810
to talk to you about
an awesome upcoming

00:20:37.810 --> 00:20:40.400
integration between
Trello and Google Slides.

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:42.220
So for those of
you who don't know,

00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:45.240
Trello is an awesome
visual collaboration

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:48.234
tool that creates a shared
perspective on any project.

00:20:48.234 --> 00:20:50.150
But for presenting
information, however, there

00:20:50.150 --> 00:20:51.742
are better tools
like Google Slides.

00:20:51.742 --> 00:20:53.200
So let's talk
through Trello first,

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:56.900
and then we'll show you a
demo of the integration.

00:20:56.900 --> 00:20:59.240
So here are real estate
agencies using Trello

00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:00.730
to manage their listings.

00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:02.730
Each property is a
card, and then they

00:21:02.730 --> 00:21:05.790
have lists for
sales, for rentals,

00:21:05.790 --> 00:21:07.580
as well properties
that are under contract

00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:09.400
and transactions
that have closed.

00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:11.890
They love how Trello gives
them an instant perspective

00:21:11.890 --> 00:21:14.910
into how their agency is
doing at any given time.

00:21:14.910 --> 00:21:17.420
When they're out and about
and showing these properties

00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:19.544
to clients, they love using
Trello on their phones

00:21:19.544 --> 00:21:21.210
to update the listings
and let everybody

00:21:21.210 --> 00:21:23.690
know when they close a deal.

00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:25.820
They also have a weekly
status meeting every Friday

00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:27.500
where they go
through each property

00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:29.562
and they give a
quick status update.

00:21:29.562 --> 00:21:32.020
So for this meeting, they want
to present this Trello board

00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:33.540
in a friendlier format.

00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:35.230
So that is where
Google Slides comes in.

00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:36.271
Can you please show both?

00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:39.540
Awesome.

00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:42.340
So every Friday morning,
the branch manager

00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:43.740
creates one of these.

00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:46.530
So this means that she
has to create a slide

00:21:46.530 --> 00:21:48.150
for each individual card.

00:21:48.150 --> 00:21:50.320
So can you open a card please?

00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:52.760
So this means that she
has to make a new slide

00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:55.440
and then copy the
title of the card

00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:57.480
into the title of
the slide, and copy

00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:00.032
the description of the card
into the body of the slide,

00:22:00.032 --> 00:22:01.990
and then just download
an image and get that up

00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:03.190
in there as well.

00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:04.630
And align it all nicely.

00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:06.786
And then has to do that
about 50 more times.

00:22:06.786 --> 00:22:08.160
So it's kind of
the type of thing

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:10.326
that ruins a Friday morning,
they just kind of spend

00:22:10.326 --> 00:22:11.812
copy pasting back and forth.

00:22:11.812 --> 00:22:14.020
And then you present the
report and there's an error,

00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:15.000
because the property's
wrong because you

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.166
copy pasted the wrong thing.

00:22:16.166 --> 00:22:18.180
So it's not very fun at all.

00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:22.530
So as you probably suspect,
we have built a better way

00:22:22.530 --> 00:22:23.880
to do this.

00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:26.480
So I'm going to ask Ajay to
close out that other card

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:28.850
and click that Create
Presentation button.

00:22:28.850 --> 00:22:31.284
So this magic is happening.

00:22:31.284 --> 00:22:33.200
As you can see, the data
from the Trello board

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:36.160
is being automatically
exported in real time

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:37.660
into Google Slides.

00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:39.504
Everything is
automatically updated.

00:22:39.504 --> 00:22:41.670
You can see it looks beautiful
and ready to present.

00:22:41.670 --> 00:22:44.515
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:47.910 --> 00:22:51.520
So that saved a lot of
copy pasting around.

00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:53.660
And since Trello is
such a horizontal tool

00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:55.632
with so many use
cases, this is only one

00:22:55.632 --> 00:22:58.090
of the examples where this new
integration is going to save

00:22:58.090 --> 00:22:59.860
our users a lot of time.

00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:02.712
It's very powerful,
very easy to use,

00:23:02.712 --> 00:23:04.170
and it's actually
very, very simple

00:23:04.170 --> 00:23:07.612
to build for us, which
is awesome always.

00:23:07.612 --> 00:23:09.070
Our vision with
Trello is to create

00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:11.720
a flexible horizontal
collaboration tool that can

00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:13.435
help people organize anything.

00:23:13.435 --> 00:23:16.060
With this new integration, we're
very excited to give our users

00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:19.030
yet another way to
present information

00:23:19.030 --> 00:23:22.790
in a visual, meaningful,
and easy way with a tool

00:23:22.790 --> 00:23:24.730
they already love to use.

00:23:24.730 --> 00:23:25.270
Thank you.

00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:34.360
AJAY SURIE: Thanks, Hamid, and
thanks to you and your team

00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:35.870
for all the feedback
you've given us

00:23:35.870 --> 00:23:39.270
as we work together on this.

00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:44.590
So the next example is
about custom workflows.

00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:46.140
Slides is a great
tool for telling

00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:48.930
compelling visual stories,
but putting together

00:23:48.930 --> 00:23:51.790
polished visuals is
pretty time consuming.

00:23:51.790 --> 00:23:54.330
Even if you've got reference
visuals or slide templates

00:23:54.330 --> 00:23:56.090
to work with, it's
still something you

00:23:56.090 --> 00:23:58.480
have to do over and over again.

00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:00.320
For example, if
you're a sales person

00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:03.094
and you've got to create a
custom deck for each of your 30

00:24:03.094 --> 00:24:04.510
clients, you're
going to literally

00:24:04.510 --> 00:24:06.210
be doing this all day.

00:24:06.210 --> 00:24:07.710
So in this next
example, we're going

00:24:07.710 --> 00:24:11.200
to talk to you about how you
can merge data into a slide

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:13.940
template to create
custom presentations

00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:15.580
with a consistent look and feel.

00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:19.140
So it'll save users
a ton of time.

00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:21.916
And I'm going to call up Steve
Holm from ProsperWorks who's

00:24:21.916 --> 00:24:23.540
going to talk us
through the next demo.

00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:29.440
STEVE HOLM: Thanks, Ajay.

00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:30.930
Hey guys, I'm
Steve, I'm director

00:24:30.930 --> 00:24:32.427
of design at
ProsperWorks, and I'm

00:24:32.427 --> 00:24:35.010
excited to be here today to talk
to you a little bit about how

00:24:35.010 --> 00:24:37.250
ProsperWorks integrates
with Google Apps.

00:24:37.250 --> 00:24:40.290
So ProsperWorks
is a CRM designed

00:24:40.290 --> 00:24:42.620
to help companies
sell more faster.

00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:45.440
And we do this by making
our products simple and easy

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:47.320
to use, and by integrating
with the products

00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:50.150
you already use at work
today, like Google Apps.

00:24:50.150 --> 00:24:52.340
In fact, we're happy to
announce we've recently

00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:54.450
become part of the
Recommended Google Apps

00:24:54.450 --> 00:24:57.610
for Work program, which
is super exciting.

00:24:57.610 --> 00:25:00.570
So two specific goals we have
in all of our integrations

00:25:00.570 --> 00:25:03.910
with Google Apps are, one, to
eliminate as much manual data

00:25:03.910 --> 00:25:06.210
entry as possible from
the sales process,

00:25:06.210 --> 00:25:07.670
and two, cut down
on the switching

00:25:07.670 --> 00:25:10.590
back and forth
between applications.

00:25:10.590 --> 00:25:13.230
So today, sales teams
use ProsperWorks

00:25:13.230 --> 00:25:16.370
to track the progress of their
leads and their opportunities.

00:25:16.370 --> 00:25:18.630
And a lot of times
during the sales process,

00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:21.370
reps like to create
custom presentations

00:25:21.370 --> 00:25:24.580
for their potential buyers.

00:25:24.580 --> 00:25:27.470
The problem is,
these presentations,

00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:30.610
as you can imagine,
they take a ton of time.

00:25:30.610 --> 00:25:32.510
To create a custom
presentation for each one

00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:35.310
of these potential buyers
can be super tedious,

00:25:35.310 --> 00:25:38.130
time consuming, and is
prone to a lot of errors.

00:25:38.130 --> 00:25:41.130
So with that in mind, we
created an integration

00:25:41.130 --> 00:25:44.680
that allows moving customer
information from ProsperWorks

00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:46.610
into a custom Google
Slides presentation

00:25:46.610 --> 00:25:48.364
as easy as clicking a button.

00:25:48.364 --> 00:25:49.780
So let me show you
how this works.

00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:53.400
I'll have Ajay help me
walk you through this demo.

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:56.860
So if you look over
here in this example,

00:25:56.860 --> 00:25:59.730
I'm an account executive
inside ProsperWorks managing

00:25:59.730 --> 00:26:02.420
a list of potential buyers
of an in-home solar panel

00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:03.325
installation.

00:26:03.325 --> 00:26:05.200
And you can see here
I'm tracking information

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:08.310
about each customer like what
their monthly bill value is,

00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:11.060
what their bill will be after
they install solar, system

00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:13.430
size, and a whole bunch
of other information.

00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:15.290
And so what I want
to do is click

00:26:15.290 --> 00:26:17.380
on one of these
potential customers

00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:19.380
and create a custom
presentation for them.

00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:22.420
So let's go ahead click
on the Burton residence.

00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:23.850
And you'll see up
here in the top

00:26:23.850 --> 00:26:26.100
I have an option to turn
this into a new Google Slides

00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:26.740
presentation.

00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:28.010
So let's click that.

00:26:28.010 --> 00:26:30.600
And here in step one, I can
create this new presentation.

00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:35.310
So first, I can click here
to browse in Google Drive.

00:26:35.310 --> 00:26:36.050
Oops.

00:26:36.050 --> 00:26:37.341
AJAY SURIE: That's a live demo.

00:26:37.341 --> 00:26:39.170
STEVE HOLM: It's a live demo.

00:26:39.170 --> 00:26:40.020
Just one second.

00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:41.221
This always happens, right?

00:26:45.336 --> 00:26:46.460
Anyone know any good jokes?

00:26:52.270 --> 00:26:54.180
See how much time
this is saving?

00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:56.430
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:00.087 --> 00:27:01.670
All right, let's
give it another shot.

00:27:01.670 --> 00:27:04.620
So let's click on
the Burton residence,

00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:06.970
and we'll go up here to
create the new presentation.

00:27:06.970 --> 00:27:09.670
Step one, what I want to do
is now I want to click on this

00:27:09.670 --> 00:27:11.710
and browse Google Drive
for an existing template

00:27:11.710 --> 00:27:13.390
that I've already created
for all of my solar panel

00:27:13.390 --> 00:27:13.973
installations.

00:27:13.973 --> 00:27:15.700
So I can click that.

00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:18.380
I can go back here, give this
presentation a custom name,

00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:20.530
and choose where I want to
save it in Google Drive.

00:27:20.530 --> 00:27:21.700
And then I click
Create and Continue.

00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:23.783
And if you watch over here,
what's going to happen

00:27:23.783 --> 00:27:26.290
is a new presentation
for the Burton residence

00:27:26.290 --> 00:27:28.960
is going to be created
here in Google Drive.

00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:30.370
So there it is.

00:27:30.370 --> 00:27:33.870
So let's go ahead and
open up that presentation.

00:27:33.870 --> 00:27:36.090
So here you can see I have
a solar panel installation

00:27:36.090 --> 00:27:39.310
presentation, and it has
placeholders for the client

00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:41.687
name, a monthly utility bill.

00:27:41.687 --> 00:27:43.770
Now, typically, this would
be the end of the demo,

00:27:43.770 --> 00:27:45.850
because the Burtons'
information would already

00:27:45.850 --> 00:27:47.060
be merged into the slide.

00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:49.400
But for the purpose
of this demo,

00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:52.100
we wanted to show
you this happen live.

00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:54.630
So what we want to do is
jump back over into here.

00:27:54.630 --> 00:27:56.822
And before Ajay clicks the
Merge and Finish button,

00:27:56.822 --> 00:27:58.530
I want everyone to
still watch over here,

00:27:58.530 --> 00:28:00.488
because this is where
the magic happens and all

00:28:00.488 --> 00:28:02.340
that information is
brought over here.

00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:04.896
So go ahead and
click that button.

00:28:04.896 --> 00:28:06.270
And you can see,
boom, real time.

00:28:06.270 --> 00:28:08.840
How cool is that, huh?

00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:09.990
Sold.

00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:13.680
All of that information from the
Burton residence in one click

00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:14.410
copied over here.

00:28:14.410 --> 00:28:17.180
So now you can see I've got
their actual monthly bill,

00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:19.420
their actual price of
electricity, system size,

00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:21.655
all that info in this
custom presentation.

00:28:21.655 --> 00:28:23.530
So now I can go ahead
and add anything I want

00:28:23.530 --> 00:28:26.450
and share it off with
the Burton residence.

00:28:26.450 --> 00:28:28.970
So if you can imagine,
I'm an account executive

00:28:28.970 --> 00:28:31.690
doing this 15 to
20 times a day, I

00:28:31.690 --> 00:28:34.280
mean this is going to take
me hours of, you guessed it,

00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:37.250
copying and pasting back and
forth between ProsperWorks

00:28:37.250 --> 00:28:39.000
and Google Slides.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.430
I mean, yesterday,
I heard some data

00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:43.700
that it takes about 15
minutes, on average,

00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:46.120
for a sales rep to create
a custom presentation.

00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:47.930
So 15 times what.

00:28:47.930 --> 00:28:50.010
I have 32 opportunities in here?

00:28:50.010 --> 00:28:51.690
That's-- I don't know
what the math is.

00:28:51.690 --> 00:28:54.121
I'm a designer, I just change
button colors and font sizes

00:28:54.121 --> 00:28:54.620
and stuff.

00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:57.950
But I don't know, 30 plus hours.

00:28:57.950 --> 00:28:59.940
So 30 plus hours.

00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:01.340
So instead with
this integration,

00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:04.050
I can do this in minutes,
maybe even seconds,

00:29:04.050 --> 00:29:06.350
giving me back those hours
to do what I do best,

00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:07.640
grow my business.

00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:09.710
So we're super excited
about this integration

00:29:09.710 --> 00:29:11.640
between ProsperWorks
and Google Slides,

00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:14.240
and we can't wait to make
it live for our customers.

00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:15.870
Thanks Ajay, thanks everybody.

00:29:15.870 --> 00:29:18.265
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:22.440
AJAY SURIE: Thanks, Steve.

00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:24.780
How cool was that?

00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:27.530
If we'd had something like that
to help us make this I/O deck,

00:29:27.530 --> 00:29:28.880
we could've saved a ton of time.

00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:34.030
So the ProsperWorks
and Trello teams

00:29:34.030 --> 00:29:35.500
will be available
after our session

00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:36.833
to answer any of your questions.

00:29:36.833 --> 00:29:41.150
But early access to
the API is open now.

00:29:41.150 --> 00:29:44.820
You can sign up with
developers.google.com/slides,

00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:47.190
and we're looking forward
to your feedback as we work

00:29:47.190 --> 00:29:49.540
to build this.

00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:51.140
We're grateful to
all our partners

00:29:51.140 --> 00:29:52.730
who have given us
a ton of feedback

00:29:52.730 --> 00:29:56.530
as we've worked to design
and build these APIs.

00:29:56.530 --> 00:29:58.800
The previous four
examples were all

00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:01.390
about taking the
tools you guys build

00:30:01.390 --> 00:30:04.430
for what people use at
work and integrate them

00:30:04.430 --> 00:30:06.910
with the Google Docs platform.

00:30:06.910 --> 00:30:10.960
But many of our users are
students and teachers.

00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:13.290
And we know that many
of yours are, too.

00:30:13.290 --> 00:30:17.010
So to talk to you about Google
Classroom and some of the APIs

00:30:17.010 --> 00:30:19.850
they're working on, I'm going
to call Ope to the stage.

00:30:24.062 --> 00:30:25.934
OPE BUKOLA: Thank you.

00:30:25.934 --> 00:30:28.020
So I'm going to have
Ajay stick around

00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:30.020
and help me out a little bit.

00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:31.470
Morning, everybody.

00:30:31.470 --> 00:30:33.910
My name is Ope Bukola,
and I'm a product manager

00:30:33.910 --> 00:30:35.490
for Google Classroom.

00:30:35.490 --> 00:30:39.000
So I'm here to talk to you
today about what Classroom does,

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.530
and how you can build
applications that work really

00:30:41.530 --> 00:30:43.340
well in schools.

00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:46.980
As Ajay mentioned, many of
the users for Docs editors

00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:48.560
are students and teachers.

00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:51.770
And when we observed them
using the editors in class,

00:30:51.770 --> 00:30:54.990
we saw a huge opportunity to
make them more productive.

00:30:54.990 --> 00:30:58.850
Here's an example of
something that we saw.

00:30:58.850 --> 00:31:01.790
So this illustration is
something we actually saw

00:31:01.790 --> 00:31:03.670
in an elementary school class.

00:31:03.670 --> 00:31:06.680
It's a teacher trying to
explain to her students

00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:09.970
how to turn in an assignment
using Google Drive.

00:31:09.970 --> 00:31:11.500
So as if it's not
bad enough to try

00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:14.730
to get 30 second graders
to write an essay,

00:31:14.730 --> 00:31:18.370
imagine taking them through this
process to turn that essay in.

00:31:18.370 --> 00:31:21.710
So we knew that to make schools
more productive, we needed

00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:23.800
to eliminate this
type of busywork,

00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:26.280
and that's why we
built Classroom.

00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:31.030
Classroom does three
things really well.

00:31:31.030 --> 00:31:32.830
The first thing it
does is it improves

00:31:32.830 --> 00:31:34.460
communication in a class.

00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:37.470
So teachers can make
announcements, ask questions,

00:31:37.470 --> 00:31:39.310
comment, and collaborate
with their students

00:31:39.310 --> 00:31:42.410
all in real time.

00:31:42.410 --> 00:31:46.870
And then Classroom weaves
together Docs, Drive, and Gmail

00:31:46.870 --> 00:31:49.760
so that teachers can create
and collect assignments

00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:51.810
paperlessly and seamlessly.

00:31:51.810 --> 00:31:53.990
So those six steps
I showed you earlier

00:31:53.990 --> 00:31:58.280
became one very
magical Turn In button.

00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:01.730
And finally, Classroom helps
classes stay organized.

00:32:01.730 --> 00:32:04.190
So we create a Drive
folder for every student

00:32:04.190 --> 00:32:05.610
and for every assignment.

00:32:05.610 --> 00:32:08.630
As students click Turn In,
their work automagically

00:32:08.630 --> 00:32:10.570
gets stored in the right place.

00:32:10.570 --> 00:32:13.460
We integrate with Calendar so
that all the work that's due

00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:18.050
is really evident to students
and to their families.

00:32:18.050 --> 00:32:20.760
Teachers absolutely
love using Classroom.

00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:23.860
They love the simplicity
of it, and the process

00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:26.790
of using Google Docs
became much easier.

00:32:26.790 --> 00:32:29.830
But we soon realized
that this wasn't enough.

00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:32.310
Teachers aren't just using
Google tools in class,

00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:34.640
they're using a lot of the
stuff that you've built.

00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:36.476
And the biggest
problem they encounter

00:32:36.476 --> 00:32:38.350
is that these tools
don't talk to each other.

00:32:38.350 --> 00:32:40.980
So it's still way
too much busywork.

00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:44.490
And last year, we introduced
two ways for developers

00:32:44.490 --> 00:32:48.020
to integrate with Classroom.

00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:50.970
The first was a Google
Classroom share button.

00:32:50.970 --> 00:32:53.060
So what the Share
button does is it's

00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:56.740
a really simple way for you to
let teachers and students take

00:32:56.740 --> 00:33:00.150
links, videos, any
content on your site,

00:33:00.150 --> 00:33:01.900
and share it to
Classroom without ever

00:33:01.900 --> 00:33:03.210
leaving your product.

00:33:03.210 --> 00:33:05.760
And the best thing about the
Share button from a developer

00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:08.800
perspective is that it's
super, super simple to use.

00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:10.549
Just a few lines of JavaScript.

00:33:10.549 --> 00:33:12.840
In fact, I bet you could
probably finish integrating it

00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:14.090
by the end of this
session if you just

00:33:14.090 --> 00:33:16.240
stopped paying attention
to everything else we're

00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:16.910
going to say.

00:33:16.910 --> 00:33:18.880
But don't do that.

00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:21.040
So the second thing
that we did is

00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:23.960
we launched what we
call the Roster API.

00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:26.870
The Roster API lets
other applications

00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:28.880
reuse the classroom rosters.

00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:31.050
So when a teacher
comes to your site,

00:33:31.050 --> 00:33:33.940
rather than having him
recreate his class,

00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:35.950
invite all the
students, he can just

00:33:35.950 --> 00:33:39.630
import and use the classes
he already has in Classroom.

00:33:39.630 --> 00:33:43.100
And since we launched the Share
button and the Roster API,

00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:45.595
hundreds of applications have
integrated with Classroom.

00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:51.810
But rosters are just
one part of the story.

00:33:51.810 --> 00:33:54.810
A lot of the magic of Classroom
comes with the assignments,

00:33:54.810 --> 00:33:56.630
the announcements,
the work that's

00:33:56.630 --> 00:33:58.510
actually happening in class.

00:33:58.510 --> 00:34:00.880
And today, getting that
assignment and grade

00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:03.520
information from
Classroom to other tools

00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:04.960
is still way too time-consuming.

00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:14.440
And getting grades from
Classroom to other systems

00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:16.920
is especially
painful for teachers.

00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:19.949
Teachers tell us they spend
a lot of time doing this,

00:34:19.949 --> 00:34:22.150
and it often looks
just like this, right?

00:34:22.150 --> 00:34:23.550
Copying and pasting.

00:34:23.550 --> 00:34:25.874
So imagine you've
graded 100 essays,

00:34:25.874 --> 00:34:27.290
and then you're
rewarded by having

00:34:27.290 --> 00:34:30.370
to do this to get the grades
from Classroom to the reporting

00:34:30.370 --> 00:34:33.150
system where they
need to end up.

00:34:33.150 --> 00:34:35.860
So we wanted to eliminate
this, and that's

00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:38.270
why yesterday we
launched improvements

00:34:38.270 --> 00:34:40.050
to the Classroom API.

00:34:40.050 --> 00:34:44.159
These improvements let
developers create and modify

00:34:44.159 --> 00:34:48.469
assignment data, which
we call Coursework.

00:34:48.469 --> 00:34:50.550
And with the new
Coursework endpoints,

00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:53.350
you can sync assignments
and grades with Classroom,

00:34:53.350 --> 00:34:55.560
and this really
removes the busywork

00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:59.540
of manually transferring
the data for teachers.

00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:01.320
So here are just a
couple of the things

00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:05.680
that you can do with
Coursework in Classroom.

00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:07.450
And to show you what
I mean, I'm going

00:35:07.450 --> 00:35:10.100
to show a quick demo from
one of our partners, Tynker.

00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:12.420
Unfortunately Tynker
couldn't join us live,

00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:14.977
but they've been hard at
work building and using

00:35:14.977 --> 00:35:17.310
these new end points, and I'm
really excited to show you

00:35:17.310 --> 00:35:19.840
what they've built. So
Ajay's going to help me out.

00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:26.000
So what we've got on the screen
here is Google Classroom.

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:29.090
And over here we'll have a
student's view of Classroom,

00:35:29.090 --> 00:35:32.300
and on the right, we'll have
a teacher's view of Classroom.

00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:35.210
So Ajay, go ahead and
go over to Tynker.

00:35:35.210 --> 00:35:37.820
So Tynker is a
tool that teachers

00:35:37.820 --> 00:35:40.410
use to teach their
students programming.

00:35:40.410 --> 00:35:44.220
It's used by over 5,000
schools around the world.

00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:46.310
It's a really, really
simple process.

00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:48.940
Typically, though, when a
teacher starts using Tynker,

00:35:48.940 --> 00:35:52.550
the first thing she would
do is create her class

00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:54.220
and get her students loaded.

00:35:54.220 --> 00:35:57.490
This might involve copying and
pasting from another document,

00:35:57.490 --> 00:36:00.550
or maybe if she's lucky,
she could upload a CSV.

00:36:00.550 --> 00:36:02.830
The integration takes
away that process.

00:36:02.830 --> 00:36:06.150
So Ajay's just going to go ahead
and select the Computing 101

00:36:06.150 --> 00:36:10.780
class, and link the Google
Classroom class to Tynker.

00:36:10.780 --> 00:36:13.160
So what this does is it
automatically creates

00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:15.895
the class in Tynker and
imports the students.

00:36:19.030 --> 00:36:20.544
Do we have students
in classrooms?

00:36:20.544 --> 00:36:21.710
AJAY SURIE: No students yet.

00:36:21.710 --> 00:36:24.505
OPE BUKOLA: OK, so
let's try syncing.

00:36:24.505 --> 00:36:26.720
So if you click that Sync
with Google Classroom

00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:29.060
button on the right
there, hopefully we'll

00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:30.920
get all of our students.

00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:32.270
There we go.

00:36:32.270 --> 00:36:35.220
Now all of our
students are loaded.

00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:38.070
So now we've got students from
Classroom linked to Tynker.

00:36:38.070 --> 00:36:40.800
We're going to go ahead
and assign some lessons.

00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:43.720
So if you click over
to the lesson, Ajay,

00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:46.206
you can just go ahead and
assign a few of those lessons.

00:36:50.090 --> 00:36:52.850
So while he assigns
the lessons, this

00:36:52.850 --> 00:36:55.240
is the part where the real
busywork comes in, right?

00:36:55.240 --> 00:36:57.020
So the teacher's
gone to Tynker, she's

00:36:57.020 --> 00:36:59.320
created this awesome
lessons, but now she

00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:01.260
has to get that
data in Classroom.

00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:04.160
And she would typically copy
and paste the assignments

00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:05.580
over in Classroom.

00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:07.530
But with the new
coursework end points,

00:37:07.530 --> 00:37:09.170
she no longer has to do that.

00:37:09.170 --> 00:37:10.940
The assignment data
is automatically

00:37:10.940 --> 00:37:12.180
sent to Classroom.

00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:15.105
So from the student's view,
Ajay, just click Show.

00:37:17.611 --> 00:37:18.110
Great.

00:37:18.110 --> 00:37:20.230
So you'll see that all
of her Tynker assignments

00:37:20.230 --> 00:37:22.689
have been brought to
Classroom automatically.

00:37:22.689 --> 00:37:24.730
And then we're going to
have the student complete

00:37:24.730 --> 00:37:26.190
one of the assignments.

00:37:26.190 --> 00:37:28.265
Let's go ahead and do the
animated card creator.

00:37:33.230 --> 00:37:35.940
So the student's going to
come to Tynker and start

00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:36.590
this lesson.

00:37:40.759 --> 00:37:43.050
This is a really cool lesson,
but for the sake of time,

00:37:43.050 --> 00:37:44.091
we'll just click through.

00:37:47.830 --> 00:37:50.780
So Ajay's going to
finish up the assignment,

00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:53.780
and then we'll encounter another
point where users typically

00:37:53.780 --> 00:37:56.260
had to do a lot of
manual work, and that's

00:37:56.260 --> 00:37:59.830
getting the students'
results back into Classroom.

00:37:59.830 --> 00:38:02.946
And this new API also
eliminates that process.

00:38:02.946 --> 00:38:08.260
So Ajay's back in classroom
as the teacher on that side.

00:38:08.260 --> 00:38:12.110
So you can just go
ahead and refresh.

00:38:12.110 --> 00:38:14.820
So as you saw, the student
just finished working

00:38:14.820 --> 00:38:17.561
on animated card creator.

00:38:17.561 --> 00:38:19.560
So on this side, we're
going to have the student

00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:20.620
turn in the assignment.

00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:22.340
And I just want
you to observe what

00:38:22.340 --> 00:38:24.058
the teacher sees in Classroom.

00:38:24.058 --> 00:38:25.932
So go ahead and turn in
the assignment, Ajay.

00:38:36.130 --> 00:38:38.250
So the assignment is
turned in in Tynker,

00:38:38.250 --> 00:38:40.680
and you can see that that data
has been automatically sent

00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:41.800
to Classroom.

00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:44.000
We now see that one
student is done.

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:45.480
At this point, if
the student also

00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:47.380
had any grades or
other feedback,

00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:50.430
Tynker would automatically
push that to Classroom as well.

00:38:50.430 --> 00:38:51.930
So thanks for helping
with the demo.

00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:55.570
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:55.570 --> 00:38:56.183
Thank you.

00:39:01.270 --> 00:39:01.870
Great.

00:39:01.870 --> 00:39:04.980
So Coursework is available
in the Classroom API now,

00:39:04.980 --> 00:39:06.770
and we're really
grateful to Tynker

00:39:06.770 --> 00:39:09.510
and a lot of other partners
who helped test this out

00:39:09.510 --> 00:39:14.190
and gave us really great
feedback along the way.

00:39:14.190 --> 00:39:16.520
And if you're interested in
integrating with Classroom,

00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:17.840
we'd love to talk to you.

00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:20.650
Come find us later and
we'll show you how it works.

00:39:20.650 --> 00:39:23.520
We're really excited to work
with the developer community

00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:25.690
to continue building
tools that work really

00:39:25.690 --> 00:39:27.827
well for teachers and students.

00:39:31.170 --> 00:39:34.470
So to recap what we've
talked about this morning,

00:39:34.470 --> 00:39:37.010
Sheets has just
launched a new API

00:39:37.010 --> 00:39:39.100
that makes it
really easy for you

00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:41.580
to build workflows that
start in your product

00:39:41.580 --> 00:39:44.190
and then tap into
the power of Sheets.

00:39:44.190 --> 00:39:47.210
And Slides will soon
launch a new API

00:39:47.210 --> 00:39:50.120
that will give you the power
to programmatically create

00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:52.000
and update presentations.

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.660
And finally, the Classroom team
is letting you sync assignments

00:39:55.660 --> 00:39:59.000
and grades so that your apps
can work well in schools.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:00.990
And across all three
of our products,

00:40:00.990 --> 00:40:03.130
we're really focused
on breaking down

00:40:03.130 --> 00:40:06.780
those walls that JR mentioned,
breaking down the silos

00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:09.660
so that the applications
you're building and Google Apps

00:40:09.660 --> 00:40:12.553
work really well, and our
users become more powerful.

00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:19.780
And so together we
really think it's

00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:21.910
possible to end copy and paste.

00:40:25.411 --> 00:40:25.910
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:25.910 --> 00:40:28.010
Thank you.

00:40:28.010 --> 00:40:33.320
So thank you all for joining us
this morning, bright and early.

00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:35.990
We're going to hang out after
the presentation just outside

00:40:35.990 --> 00:40:37.190
if you want to talk to us.

00:40:37.190 --> 00:40:40.120
We'll also be available later
in office hours from 1:00

00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:41.860
to 2:00 PM.

00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:44.390
So thanks for coming.
