00:00:00.305 --> 00:00:04.110
- [Voiceover] So I have
the number 163 and that is

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.044
the same as, I have a
one in the 100s place,

00:00:07.044 --> 00:00:09.051
so that's one hundred.

00:00:11.206 --> 00:00:13.200
Plus six 10s

00:00:17.828 --> 00:00:21.549
Plus three ones, three in the ones place.

00:00:25.177 --> 00:00:30.177
Do that in the color blue which
I have for the ones place.

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:32.592
And I've drawn that out here

00:00:32.592 --> 00:00:35.519
where I actually draw 163 squares.

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:40.135
And you see it as one 100, six 10s.

00:00:40.135 --> 00:00:43.510
One, two, three, four, five, six 10s.

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.879
And three ones.

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:49.046
So this number right over here, 163,

00:00:49.046 --> 00:00:54.046
is the same thing as 100
plus six 10s plus three ones.

00:00:54.566 --> 00:00:56.606
And if you wanna think
about what it looks like,

00:00:56.606 --> 00:00:58.950
this is 163 things.

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:02.496
You see the 100, you see the six 10s.

00:01:02.496 --> 00:01:05.262
And you see the three ones.

00:01:05.262 --> 00:01:09.701
Now I now wanna add the number 324 to 163.

00:01:09.701 --> 00:01:14.701
So 324 is, if we look at
the 100s place, it's 300s.

00:01:17.916 --> 00:01:20.276
It's two 10s,

00:01:20.276 --> 00:01:22.833
Three 100s plus two 10s,

00:01:24.172 --> 00:01:29.172
And four ones, so plus four ones.

00:01:29.466 --> 00:01:32.324
And we see that right over here drawn out,

00:01:32.324 --> 00:01:34.274
or I guess all the boxes.

00:01:34.275 --> 00:01:37.217
So 324 boxes, this is 324 boxes.

00:01:37.217 --> 00:01:40.740
You have three 100s, one two three 100s,

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.866
Two 10s, one two 10s,

00:01:43.866 --> 00:01:45.227
And four ones.

00:01:45.227 --> 00:01:50.189
And so this number 324 is three 100s,

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.068
two 10s, and four ones.

00:01:53.068 --> 00:01:55.634
And if you wanna think
about how many boxes it is,

00:01:55.635 --> 00:01:57.844
it's that many, and you see them.

00:01:57.844 --> 00:02:01.395
They are grouped into three groups of 100,

00:02:01.395 --> 00:02:02.512
that's the 300s,

00:02:02.513 --> 00:02:04.430
two groups of 10, that's the two 10s,

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.334
and then four ones.

00:02:07.334 --> 00:02:09.445
So now let's add them together.

00:02:09.445 --> 00:02:11.533
So let's first look at the ones place.

00:02:11.533 --> 00:02:13.852
So the ones place you're
gonna have three ones

00:02:13.853 --> 00:02:15.620
plus four ones,

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.124
well that's gonna be,
let me do this in blue.

00:02:19.124 --> 00:02:22.148
That's going to be seven ones.

00:02:22.148 --> 00:02:26.682
Three ones plus four
ones, that is seven ones.

00:02:26.682 --> 00:02:30.146
A seven in the ones place is seven ones.

00:02:30.146 --> 00:02:32.130
And we see that right over here.

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.081
Three ones plus four
ones, that's seven ones.

00:02:36.081 --> 00:02:38.846
Now I have six 10s and two 10s,

00:02:38.847 --> 00:02:41.652
well if I add them together
I'm gonna have eight 10s.

00:02:43.882 --> 00:02:46.453
If I have six 10s and two 10s,

00:02:46.453 --> 00:02:48.536
the six and this two
they're in the 10s place.

00:02:48.536 --> 00:02:51.838
So this represents six 10s,

00:02:51.838 --> 00:02:53.037
this represents two 10s.

00:02:53.037 --> 00:02:56.109
Six 10s plus two 10s is eight 10s.

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:57.373
And we also see it here,

00:02:57.373 --> 00:03:01.917
six 10s plus two 10s is eight 10s.

00:03:04.547 --> 00:03:09.547
And finally we have one 100
plus another three 100s.

00:03:10.257 --> 00:03:12.979
So that's going to be four 100s.

00:03:14.855 --> 00:03:15.781
And you see them right over here,

00:03:15.782 --> 00:03:17.765
one, two, three, four.

00:03:17.765 --> 00:03:21.100
Four hundreds, let me circle all of these.

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.578
100 plus 300 is 400.

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:30.035
So 163 plus 324 is 487.

00:03:30.035 --> 00:03:34.213
Four 100s, eight 10s, and seven ones.
