00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The answer is the second choice. The first choice doesn't make any sense at all.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The difference between the second choice and the third choice is whether we use

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
the encryption function or decryption.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
The reason that we're using encryption function just like we did in encrypting

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
is because when we're decrypting we have these cipher text,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and we're trying to get the messages, so we're just trying to go through these XORs

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000
in the reverse direction.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
That means we need the same exact thing that we had in encryption to XOR out,

00:00:28.000 --> 99:59:59.000
which is the result of encrypting these Xi values.
