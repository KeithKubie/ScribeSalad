SPEAKER 1: Well, welcome,
everybody-- here and online--

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:11.840
to an extension
of our sleep week

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.480
where we are attempting to
change the culture of sleep

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.200
at Google through information
and wonderful guest speakers

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.890
such as Dr. Meir Kryger here.

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.800
I did my PhD in sleep
and circadian genetics

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.890
at Northwestern,
and Meir literally

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.910
wrote the book that anyone
would start out with.

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.720
So as close as we
have to a sleep bible,

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.560
mirror Meir wrote that.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.820
So he has brought together
more sleep scientists

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.040
in sort of one
compendium and probably

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.822
in one place than anyone I
know, and he has graciously

00:00:46.822 --> 00:00:48.530
spent time over the
last couple of years,

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.950
I believe, writing
a similar type book

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.400
but for everyone that's not
necessarily a scientist.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.434
And so I will let him tell
you about that right now.

00:00:58.434 --> 00:00:59.100
MEIR KRYGER: OK.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.730
So before telling
you about my book,

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.260
I want to introduce myself.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.770
I'm a professor of medicine
at Yale University,

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.400
and I've been involved in
sleep for, believe it or not,

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.630
more than 40 years.

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.530
So I've been involved in the
sleep longer than some of you

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.410
have been alive on this planet.

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:21.197
So I have always been
really interested in sleep,

00:01:21.197 --> 00:01:22.780
and what I'm going
to talk about today

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.280
is what everybody needs
to know about sleep.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.830
I'm not going to try to turn
you into a doctor or anything,

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.340
but I'm going to want you to be
able to understand that if you

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.680
or somebody in your
family has a sleep problem

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.070
that you know how to think
about it and so forth.

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:38.900
So I'm going to
begin as we often

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:44.590
do in medicine with a
case, and in the case is

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.390
a tired elected official--

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.630
a 55-year-old elected
official-- eight year history

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.920
of late night
meetings, meals, pizza,

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.920
and soft drinks in the middle
of the night for years,

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.440
would phone cabinet members
in the middle of the night.

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.320
His performance
at work plummeted,

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.590
and he started to exhibit
very poor judgment.

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.110
And I'm not talking
about Mr. Trump.

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.160
So this is a picture of the guy.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.960
Does anybody recognize the guy?

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.264
Any guesses?

00:02:19.264 --> 00:02:20.180
I hear-- I see people.

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.330
AUDIENCE: Clinton's
famous for fast food.

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.910
MEIR KRYGER: I beg your pardon?

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.912
AUDIENCE: Clinton was famous
for pizza and fast food

00:02:24.912 --> 00:02:25.580
in the White House.

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:26.246
MEIR KRYGER: OK.

00:02:26.246 --> 00:02:29.440
So you are right.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.160
So this is taken
from "Newsweek" 2001.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.870
And those of you
who are old enough

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.010
to remember when Clinton left--
in his last week in office,

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.500
he pardoned a whole bunch
of people who should never

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.580
have been pardoned, and it
caused a lot of controversy.

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.460
And this is taken from
"Newsweek" at that time.

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.580
Some close to Clinton say
he knew perfectly well

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.190
that some of the pardons
might cause a stir

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.020
and went ahead anyway.

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:57.820
Others believe that Clinton--

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:02.230
up all night, day after day--
wasn't thinking clearly.

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:03.850
Over the years,
Clinton had tried

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:08.950
to convince himself he could
get by just fine on a few hours

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.720
of sleep a night.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.150
Time and again he
proved himself wrong.

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.020
Struggling to extricate himself
from a previous scandal,

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:22.040
Clinton once told a friend,
every important mistake

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.120
I've made in my life I've
made because I was too tired.

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.650
And this was an important sort
of theme of his presidency.

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.040
He was a tired president.

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.170
So what is the real problem?

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.530
I mean, Clinton is
obviously a smart guy.

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.780
He was the President
of the United States.

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.300
But his real problem
was one of ignorance,

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.760
and I'm not using this
in a pejorative way.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.170
He simply didn't know.

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.990
He simply didn't
know the importance

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:52.890
of sleep deprivation.

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:54.980
So the public in
general does not

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.910
know the negative impact of
sleep deprivation on the brain

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.400
and on performance.

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.800
So I'm going to give
you another case now.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.010
This is a 29-year-old
new mother.

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:08.420
She was a female.

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.570
She was an executive
secretary-- a 10-year history

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:13.115
of excessive daytime sleepiness.

00:04:13.115 --> 00:04:15.560
In other words, being
sleepy during the day

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.750
at a time when she
shouldn't have been sleepy.

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.140
She had a 20-year history
of snoring and five years

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.959
of apnea--

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.340
which means stopping breathing--

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.330
that was observed by others.

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.220
And so I'm going to go back
again for why she saw me.

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.640
So her sleepiness had been
severe for about five years,

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.670
and the problem with her was
she was unable to stay awake

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:38.870
during the daytime.

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.110
And she had a new baby at
home, and she could not

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.240
take care of the new baby.

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.420
So that was the problem.

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:49.730
So her symptoms--
during the pregnancy--

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:50.930
they worsened and worsened.

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.500
When the baby was born,
it was on the small side--

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.760
only about 5 and 1/2 pounds.

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.020
She had had two
previous miscarriages,

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.180
and I'll come back to
that a little bit later.

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.790
And when she told her
doctor about her symptoms

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:07.730
during pregnancy,
he told her not

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:11.120
to do anything because it
was too dangerous to treat

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.010
sleep apnea during pregnancy.

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:17.470
So basically, what she
did when she slept is--

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:18.880
[SNORING]

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.290
[SNORING]

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:23.440
[GASP]

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:23.940
OK.

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.030
So she made noise, then
became quiet, and then

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:28.050
started breathing again.

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:30.300
And she did this
the entire night,

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.690
and in fact, did
this every night.

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:37.680
So what was the problem with
the doctors taking care of her?

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.030
Again, it was one of ignorance.

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:43.590
Her doctor should have known
that she had a life threatening

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:49.170
condition that could affect
both her and her and her baby.

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:52.950
And again, it was really
a matter of ignorance.

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:57.810
So the public generally doesn't
know enough about sleep,

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:01.410
and the same thing is true,
by the way, for doctors.

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:05.100
The average doctor who
graduates from a medical school

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:08.550
is lucky if he or she
gets even one or two

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:12.450
hours of sleep in all four
years of medical school.

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:16.590
So the average doctor really
doesn't know a lot about sleep.

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:20.310
So what we're going to do today
in the next, I'm going to say,

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:23.190
30 minutes, is we're going
to review what everyone

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:24.360
should know about sleep.

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:27.660
And we're going to look at what
is normal, what is abnormal,

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:31.939
and if there's a problem,
what you can do about it.

00:06:31.939 --> 00:06:33.480
So here's what you're
going to learn.

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:35.550
You're going to learn
about the importance

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:36.729
and benefits of sleep.

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:39.020
You're going to learn a little
bit about sleep stages--

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:41.130
in other words,
a depth of sleep.

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:44.130
You're going to learn something
about how much sleep do you

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:47.370
as an individual
need, and then we're

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:49.290
going to talk about
sleep deprivation.

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:52.140
And chances are that
many of you in this room

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:54.960
are sleep deprived for
one reason or another--

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:57.840
be it work, be it
lifestyle, be it

00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:59.520
you have a disorder
that actually

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.410
interferes with your sleep.

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:05.700
And then I'm going to very
briefly cover the main sleep

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:09.640
conditions that we see
in the sleep clinic.

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:12.250
So one of the things
that we learned

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:17.650
about 20 or 30 years ago is
that if you don't sleep you die.

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:20.600
And this was research
that was done in animals--

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:24.880
in rodents-- and a rodent that
is sleep deprived completely

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:26.650
will eventually die.

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:30.400
And they die what I would
call a metabolic death.

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:32.990
In other words, they lose
weight, they eat a lot,

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:37.060
their fur falls out, and they
get sores all over their body.

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:38.570
And that's what happens.

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:41.540
And it probably does
happen in people,

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:44.620
and there aren't a lot of
examples that I can give you.

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:47.140
This was one that was
in the media about two

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:49.120
or three years ago.

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:54.910
This was the story of this
gentleman of Moritz Erhardt who

00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:57.760
was an intern working
for Bank of America,

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:00.640
and he was found dead
after being awake

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:04.300
for three consecutive days--

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:05.560
didn't sleep at all.

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:08.170
And there was a
lot of controversy

00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:11.950
about this because in
the banking industry,

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:14.800
there's a whole lot of
sleep deprivation, people

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:19.840
working crazy hours, very
long periods of not sleeping.

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:22.150
So this is an example
of someone where

00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:26.140
there was no other
explanation for his death.

00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:28.180
So why is sleep important?

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:31.900
It's as necessary as the water
we drink, the air we breathe,

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:34.669
and the food we eat to
function and live at our best.

00:08:34.669 --> 00:08:38.500
And it's the key to health,
performance, safety.

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:40.570
It's very important
for safety, and I'll

00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:42.190
come back to that later.

00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:45.170
And also for quality of life.

00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:48.250
So you might ask yourself,
how does the body

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:52.880
know how much sleep it needs,
and how does it do that?

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:57.490
Well, so sleep is controlled
by two separate systems,

00:08:57.490 --> 00:09:00.820
and one system I'm calling
here the sleep/wake restorative

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:03.430
process that balances
sleep and wakefulness.

00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:06.940
What that means is the longer
you're awake, the more sleepy

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:08.020
you become.

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:09.970
So if you've been
awake for 16 hours,

00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:11.230
you're going to be sleepy.

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:13.000
If you've been
awake for 18 hours,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.890
you're going to
be really sleepy.

00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:18.220
20 hours, you'll have
to fight to actually

00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:25.310
stay awake, and that corresponds
to an increase in your brain

00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:27.880
of a chemical called adenosine.

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:32.290
And adenosine is like a
marker of sleep deprivation.

00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:33.850
Now, does anybody
in this room use

00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:38.321
an adenosine blocker
for their health?

00:09:38.321 --> 00:09:38.820
OK.

00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:41.880
How many of you had a cup
of coffee this morning?

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:42.380
OK.

00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:45.320
So caffeine is an
adenosine blocker,

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:49.640
and the reason why caffeine
works in waking you up

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:52.860
is because its
effect on adenosine.

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:56.930
So the other thing that
controls the timing of sleep

00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:59.750
is a circadian biological clock.

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:02.930
So inside our brains,
we have a clock that

00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:05.840
actually keeps track of time.

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:10.570
And it regulates the timing
of sleep and wakefulness.

00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:15.370
And as a result of these
two things acting together,

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:22.250
we have alertness which
varies over the 24-hour day.

00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:24.730
So here, we have high
alertness, low alertness.

00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:27.100
9 o'clock in the
morning, most of us

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:29.350
should be wide awake and alert.

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:33.089
And around now, many of
you are going to be tired.

00:10:33.089 --> 00:10:35.380
You're going to have what's
called a mid-afternoon dip,

00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:38.200
and it doesn't matter
whether you've eaten or not.

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:41.170
This is a function of
your circadian clock.

00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:43.150
Then you're going to
be much more awake.

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:47.260
And then suddenly at
the end of the evening,

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.870
you're suddenly
going to fall asleep.

00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:54.500
You're going to lose alertness,
and then the day begins again.

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:56.890
So that's how
sleep is regulated.

00:10:56.890 --> 00:11:00.220
Two different systems-- one
depends on how much you slept,

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:03.490
and the other one depends
on your biological clock.

00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:06.490
So where is this
mysterious clock?

00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:08.886
So this mysterious
clock is found right

00:11:08.886 --> 00:11:10.010
in the middle of the brain.

00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:14.430
This is a cross section--
meaning a slice of the head--

00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:15.790
and it's right here.

00:11:15.790 --> 00:11:18.100
It's a suprachiasmatic nucleus.

00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:22.060
It's a group of cells that are
in the middle of the brain,

00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:24.880
and these cells have
a pacemaker function.

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:28.120
One can take these cells and
put them into another animal,

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:31.690
and we could find
that that animal is

00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:37.940
going to have the rhythm of
the donor animal, if you will.

00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:39.700
So it resides in the brain.

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:41.200
Now, how does it know?

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:43.570
How does something in
the middle of the brain

00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:46.180
know what time it is, right?

00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:48.670
So the way it knows
what time it is-- it's

00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:51.670
affected by light and dark.

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:55.240
So we have sensors in the eye--

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:59.080
certain types of cells that
are very sensitive to sunlight.

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:00.970
Actually, to light in general--

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:02.320
not just sunlight.

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:06.200
And they send information to
the suprachiasmatic nucleus

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:08.620
and basically synchronizes it.

00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:11.350
So every time you
wake up in the morning

00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:13.330
and you're exposed
to light, you're

00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:17.320
actually synchronizing
your circadian clock.

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:19.330
And so this is
something that we've

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:22.720
known about for a very
long period of time.

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:26.320
So it turns out that
not only does the brain

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:30.100
or the cells in the brain
have a built in clock,

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:32.950
so does every single
cell of your body.

00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:37.570
Every cell of your body has
the genetic information in it

00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:40.360
to actually have
a clock function.

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:46.210
And so all cells have a biologic
rhythm, so the liver at night

00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:49.244
doesn't work the same way as
the liver during the daytime.

00:12:49.244 --> 00:12:51.160
Although, I'm sure you've
never really thought

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:53.530
about how the liver works.

00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:57.310
Now, how the master clock
in the brain controls

00:12:57.310 --> 00:13:00.070
all the others is
still a mystery.

00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:02.710
In other words, all the
clocks are synchronized.

00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:07.510
Your liver knows whether
it's day or night,

00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:10.750
so we don't really know
about all the connections.

00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:14.650
And it certainly isn't via sort
of an in-body internet, but who

00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:17.510
knows what they'll
discover one day.

00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:20.290
So what happens if
these clocks break?

00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:22.330
So this is a colleague of mine.

00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:25.390
You know him-- this
is Fred Turek who

00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:29.160
worked with the gentleman
who introduced me.

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:31.270
Yeah, and so look.

00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:32.710
This is a mouse.

00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:37.120
This is a rodent that has
a mutant circadian clock.

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:38.290
It becomes obese.

00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:42.050
It develops the
features of diabetes.

00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:46.162
And these two rodents
are actually twins.

00:13:46.162 --> 00:13:47.620
I guess there were
a bunch of them,

00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:49.840
so I don't know
what you call two

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:52.120
of a group of a
whole bunch of them.

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:57.520
So we know that if you
have a mutant clock,

00:13:57.520 --> 00:13:59.290
you become very abnormal.

00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:02.800
And there are many conditions
that can cause your clock

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:06.040
to either become confused-- and
I'll talk about those a little

00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:06.880
bit later--

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:09.790
or to malfunction.

00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:12.050
So normally, when
we go to sleep,

00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:14.980
we don't just go from being
awake to being asleep.

00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:17.080
There is a pattern that
has been recognized

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:18.920
for many, many years.

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:22.100
So when we go to bed,
we're awake for a while,

00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:26.080
usually between 5
and 10 or 20 minutes,

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:29.390
and we then have a very
orderly progression

00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:33.910
during the different
stages or depths of sleep.

00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:38.140
And the deepest ones are down
here-- stages three and four

00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:41.710
which we call deep sleep,
and they occur mostly

00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:45.040
at the very beginning of
the night in the first third

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:47.170
of the night.

00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:49.990
Like magic, we have--

00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:52.570
after about 90 minutes
of being asleep--

00:14:52.570 --> 00:14:55.870
we go into what's called
rapid eye movement sleep.

00:14:55.870 --> 00:15:00.040
And rapid eye movement sleep is
a very, very interesting phase

00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:02.530
because this is when we dream.

00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:05.960
And we're also paralyzed during
rapid eye movement sleep,

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:10.390
which means we cannot
respond physically to what

00:15:10.390 --> 00:15:12.460
we're actually dreaming.

00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:14.420
And you'll see a
little bit later,

00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:21.050
there are some diseases
where someone, for example,

00:15:21.050 --> 00:15:22.900
has an abnormality
in the system that

00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:27.280
paralyzes you that results
in the person acting out

00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:28.360
their dreams.

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:31.390
And they can harm
their bed partner.

00:15:31.390 --> 00:15:36.580
So we have the first episode of
dreaming at about 90 minutes,

00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:42.040
and then we have there after,
about every 90 minutes,

00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:46.160
another episode of rapid eye
movement sleep or dreaming.

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:46.660
OK.

00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:50.470
So all of us will dream on the
average between three and five

00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:51.940
times a night.

00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:55.840
Most people, if they're lucky,
will remember one dream.

00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:59.200
Many people do not remember
any of their dreams,

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:02.950
and in part, that
depends on whether or not

00:16:02.950 --> 00:16:07.900
they've awakened during a
dream or in proximity in time

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:10.100
to a dream.

00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:13.210
So we need consolidated sleep.

00:16:13.210 --> 00:16:18.730
And what I mean by consolidated
is long stretches of sleep

00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:22.340
in which we think is
very restorative for all

00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:23.170
these reasons--

00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:26.500
for safety, cognitive function.

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:29.470
If you don't sleep enough,
your cognitive function

00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:31.840
quickly becomes abnormal.

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:33.940
Relating well to others--

00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:37.480
you can almost always recognize
someone who's sleep deprived.

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:39.190
They're snappy,
they're irritable,

00:16:39.190 --> 00:16:41.630
you don't want to
be around them.

00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:45.880
And it turns out that learning
and memory consolidation

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:51.190
are really important in terms
of the function of sleep.

00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:56.980
And to put it into a context
that you as engineers mostly

00:16:56.980 --> 00:16:59.500
will understand, what
happens during sleep

00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:05.829
is the REM, the memory and
REM, is put onto a hard drive.

00:17:05.829 --> 00:17:08.530
In other words,
the volatile memory

00:17:08.530 --> 00:17:11.920
is stored permanently,
and so that's

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:13.990
what happens during sleep--

00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:17.710
particularly, during
rapid eye movement sleep.

00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:19.450
And there are many
health problems

00:17:19.450 --> 00:17:21.520
that arise in
someone who doesn't

00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:24.859
sleep enough or properly.

00:17:24.859 --> 00:17:27.080
So how much sleep do you need?

00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:27.579
OK.

00:17:27.579 --> 00:17:33.070
So most of you are going
to be in this group here.

00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:35.800
You're going to need between
seven and nine hours,

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:39.940
and the range goes from
about six to about 11.

00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:43.610
Some people will need 12,
as you'll see in a minute.

00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:46.250
How many people here
sleep less than,

00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:49.901
on the average, less
than seven hours?

00:17:49.901 --> 00:17:50.400
OK.

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:53.440
So it looks like
about 25% of you.

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:57.430
So we did a survey
among students at Yale

00:17:57.430 --> 00:17:59.410
at a sleep fair
about a year ago,

00:17:59.410 --> 00:18:03.370
and probably about 25%
or 30% of the students

00:18:03.370 --> 00:18:06.550
were actually sleeping
less than seven hours.

00:18:06.550 --> 00:18:08.170
And there were
quite a few who were

00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:10.550
sleeping less than five hours.

00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:15.400
So it's a huge problem.

00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:17.470
I said the word
huge, and so here we

00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:20.590
have the current president
of the United States.

00:18:20.590 --> 00:18:23.380
And sleep needs vary.

00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:25.630
So this is an actual quote.

00:18:25.630 --> 00:18:27.730
This is an actual quote.

00:18:27.730 --> 00:18:31.120
How does someone that's
sleeping 12 and 14 hours a day

00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:33.910
compete with someone that's
sleeping three or four?

00:18:33.910 --> 00:18:37.480
He admitted to only sleeping
three or four hours.

00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:41.260
And to people in
the sleep field,

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:43.420
this was an extremely
scary statement.

00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:47.200
Because if you studied sleep,
three to four hours of sleep

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:48.430
is scary.

00:18:48.430 --> 00:18:53.560
And so athletes-- so
tell that to LeBron James

00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:55.270
and a lot of other athletes.

00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:58.210
So LeBron James
sleeps 12 hours a day,

00:18:58.210 --> 00:18:59.950
and there are many
other athletes

00:18:59.950 --> 00:19:01.960
that sleep a great deal--

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:06.190
way more than what I showed
you in terms of recommendation.

00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:08.320
And you might ask
yourself the question,

00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:12.280
what advantage does an
athlete have in sleeping more?

00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:15.250
So when you're looking
at a world class athlete,

00:19:15.250 --> 00:19:18.700
everybody at that kind of
level is physically the same.

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:21.130
They're all in great shape,
and they're all strong,

00:19:21.130 --> 00:19:22.570
and they're all quick.

00:19:22.570 --> 00:19:25.510
The difference is in the brain.

00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:29.020
And that's where the
difference resides,

00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:33.350
and so sleep for athletes
is critically important.

00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:35.500
It's critically important
for airline pilots.

00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:38.230
It's critically important
for the people that

00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:41.890
sit in the Google
autonomous vehicles watching

00:19:41.890 --> 00:19:45.610
the car do its thing.

00:19:45.610 --> 00:19:48.430
So being awake is
very important.

00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:51.580
So people in general
in the US society

00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:55.450
are not getting sufficient
sleep, and about 40%

00:19:55.450 --> 00:19:57.625
of the population are
not getting the seven

00:19:57.625 --> 00:19:58.540
to nine hours.

00:19:58.540 --> 00:20:02.170
In the US, the average is
probably about 6 and 1/2 hours

00:20:02.170 --> 00:20:05.080
right now among adults.

00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:08.590
And of this 40%,
about 3/4 of them

00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:11.800
have sleep problems
that will either

00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:14.170
affect the quality
of their sleep

00:20:14.170 --> 00:20:16.870
or their daytime performance.

00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:19.780
So you might ask
yourself a question--

00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:22.000
does monitoring sleep work?

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.570
And how many of you
here are using a device?

00:20:25.570 --> 00:20:29.620
This is an older
model of a Fitbit.

00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:30.940
You're using a device?

00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:33.550
Do you find it useful?

00:20:33.550 --> 00:20:35.470
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:20:35.470 --> 00:20:38.830
I find it useful when it shows
me that a week has gone by

00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:41.141
and I'm way below average.

00:20:41.141 --> 00:20:41.890
MEIR KRYGER: Yeah.

00:20:41.890 --> 00:20:43.900
So my question is, would
you have already have

00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:44.890
known that anyways?

00:20:44.890 --> 00:20:46.000
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.017
MEIR KRYGER: OK,
and what about you?

00:20:48.017 --> 00:20:51.220
AUDIENCE: I'm still trying
to sort out if it's reliable.

00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:54.370
MEIR KRYGER: OK, yeah.

00:20:54.370 --> 00:20:57.680
So these devices have
been out for a long time,

00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:00.640
and believe it or not, there
isn't a whole lot of literature

00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:04.840
that validates
their use right now.

00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:07.840
And it could be that the
companies may not even be

00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:09.790
interested in validating them--

00:21:09.790 --> 00:21:14.170
that as long as the data is sort
of fuzzy, people will buy them

00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:15.970
and kind of use them.

00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:19.660
So there are many,
many gadgets out there

00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:23.050
that purport to
monitoring your sleep.

00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:26.800
Some of them sit by the bedside,
some of them sit in the bed,

00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:29.460
and then there are some
that are on the wrist.

00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:31.570
And you always have
to ask yourself, what

00:21:31.570 --> 00:21:33.640
are they actually monitoring?

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:36.490
And in some cases, we're not
sure what they're actually

00:21:36.490 --> 00:21:40.100
monitoring because they're
using proprietary systems.

00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:44.500
Now, this one-- all of the
Fitbits use an accelerometer.

00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:46.960
In other words, that
if there is movement,

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:49.120
they assume that
the person is awake.

00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:52.510
And if there's no movement,
they assume that the person

00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:55.360
is more or less asleep.

00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:59.380
But anyways, we're very early
on in the use of these kind

00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:02.790
of devices to monitor sleep.

00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:06.330
So daytime sleepiness--
not surprisingly,

00:22:06.330 --> 00:22:08.280
since a large part
of the population

00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:10.670
doesn't sleep enough.

00:22:10.670 --> 00:22:12.420
We have a lot of
daytime sleepiness,

00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:18.870
and it affects all aspects of
our life including our work.

00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:22.440
Now, has anybody here
ever pulled an all-nighter

00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:24.050
where you're up all night?

00:22:24.050 --> 00:22:24.550
OK.

00:22:24.550 --> 00:22:26.850
It seems like everybody--

00:22:26.850 --> 00:22:30.630
well, I'm going to say about
70% of the people in this room.

00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:34.260
Pulling an all-nighter
is really bad.

00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:35.970
It's, like, really bad.

00:22:35.970 --> 00:22:40.180
And it's really bad, and it's
demonstrated on this slide

00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:40.680
here.

00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:42.300
I'll take you through this.

00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:47.970
So we have a test that's called
the psychomotor vigilance task.

00:22:47.970 --> 00:22:49.020
It's a very simple test.

00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:50.970
The person sits in
front of a screen.

00:22:50.970 --> 00:22:52.310
There's a light that comes on.

00:22:52.310 --> 00:22:54.310
The person has got
to press the button.

00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:57.600
It's about as simple a
test as you can imagine,

00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:00.090
and there's several of
them that you can download

00:23:00.090 --> 00:23:02.580
onto your smart devices.

00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:07.320
So what a PVT lapse is is
that the light comes on,

00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:10.530
and the person does
not respond at all.

00:23:10.530 --> 00:23:13.120
In other words, the lights
are on, the eyes are open,

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:14.790
but there's no--

00:23:14.790 --> 00:23:17.520
the person is not responding.

00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:20.580
So in this research,
which was done

00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:23.640
at the University of
Pennsylvania, they took people

00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:29.130
and they slept different numbers
of days in a very controlled

00:23:29.130 --> 00:23:30.180
environment.

00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:32.730
So these guys slept for
eight hours a night.

00:23:32.730 --> 00:23:34.830
They were in bed for
eight hours a night.

00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:36.960
These people were in bed
for six hours a night,

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:40.290
four hours a night, and these
were people-- all-nighters.

00:23:40.290 --> 00:23:43.260
So you'll notice that
the all-nighters,

00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:48.660
after one night of not sleeping,
already had a lot of lapses.

00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:51.540
So what that means,
basically, is that they

00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:53.310
had what we call microsleeps.

00:23:53.310 --> 00:23:56.500
When you're asleep, you
basically become blind,

00:23:56.500 --> 00:24:00.150
and you don't see, and you
certainly don't respond.

00:24:00.150 --> 00:24:03.280
And these episodes can
be extremely short,

00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:06.560
which makes them
very, very dangerous.

00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:09.770
So look at someone who
only sleeps six hours.

00:24:13.050 --> 00:24:16.170
So here, that person
is after about a week,

00:24:16.170 --> 00:24:18.480
and they're starting
to become abnormal.

00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:22.650
And after about 10 days,
they are practically

00:24:22.650 --> 00:24:25.740
as abnormal as someone
who's been up all night.

00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:28.590
In other words, what
they have is a sleep debt

00:24:28.590 --> 00:24:31.200
that's getting bigger
and bigger every night

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:36.180
to the point where they now have
trouble because they are now

00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:38.410
physically impaired.

00:24:38.410 --> 00:24:41.325
Now, the reason why
this is important

00:24:41.325 --> 00:24:44.250
is that the person
who's sleep deprived

00:24:44.250 --> 00:24:47.340
may actually not
have any perception

00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:49.080
that there's a problem--

00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:51.840
may not have any perception
that there's a problem.

00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:54.450
And I'll give you an
interesting example

00:24:54.450 --> 00:24:56.280
where performance goes down.

00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:57.900
I think some of
you have probably

00:24:57.900 --> 00:25:00.310
participated in a hackathon.

00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:00.810
OK.

00:25:00.810 --> 00:25:05.040
So I did a course at Yale--

00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:06.550
a course on sleep.

00:25:06.550 --> 00:25:09.300
One of the students was
a computer science guy,

00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:13.650
and he did a very simple
experiment during a hackathon.

00:25:13.650 --> 00:25:15.660
And what he looked at--

00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:17.910
and the participants
didn't know this,

00:25:17.910 --> 00:25:20.100
which drove me crazy
because it should

00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:24.660
have gone to an IRB, an
Institutional Review Board.

00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:28.200
What he looked at was
the code that the people

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:32.730
were writing versus whether
they had to be corrected.

00:25:32.730 --> 00:25:35.790
And what he found is that in
the first 12 hours of this

00:25:35.790 --> 00:25:40.230
hackathon-- and it went on
for like 24 or more hours--

00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:43.480
is that the code that was being
written in the first 12 hours

00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:44.770
was OK.

00:25:44.770 --> 00:25:48.060
But following the 12
hours, all of a sudden,

00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:52.200
the coders were actually
correcting code as opposed

00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:56.520
to writing new code
that was actually good.

00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:59.010
So their performance
really, really

00:25:59.010 --> 00:26:01.710
dropped after about 12 hours.

00:26:01.710 --> 00:26:04.350
And to him, that
was kind of a lesson

00:26:04.350 --> 00:26:07.200
because he was not aware that--

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:10.320
so if you're up for
18 hours coding,

00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:13.950
you do not have the
perception that your abilities

00:26:13.950 --> 00:26:14.940
have actually dropped.

00:26:17.450 --> 00:26:18.620
So that's very important.

00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:21.560
It's a little bit like having
a little bit too much alcohol.

00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:26.740
You may not be aware that
you're actually impaired.

00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:29.620
So cognitive abilities
and mood are affected.

00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:33.580
Memory is affected if
you haven't slept enough.

00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:35.940
Paying attention to
and completing tasks

00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:38.140
is very abnormal.

00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:39.020
Mood is impaired.

00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:42.410
People tend to become
irritable, snappy, depressed

00:26:42.410 --> 00:26:45.730
when they're very, very sleepy.

00:26:45.730 --> 00:26:47.280
And safety is compromised.

00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:52.030
And I know people
fall asleep driving,

00:26:52.030 --> 00:26:54.010
and it's a very,
very common problem.

00:26:54.010 --> 00:26:56.950
I won't go into a
whole lot of details,

00:26:56.950 --> 00:27:01.120
but one of the potential
great things about autonomous

00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:04.510
vehicles is that autonomous
vehicles-- the software

00:27:04.510 --> 00:27:06.680
will not get tired.

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:09.580
Maybe the person who's
supposed to be in the car

00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:12.100
is going to get tired,
but the software

00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:13.960
is going to continue to operate.

00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:18.490
And so in 10, 20, 30
years when many of us

00:27:18.490 --> 00:27:23.290
will probably be sort of sitting
in an automobile that is really

00:27:23.290 --> 00:27:29.570
driving itself, theoretically,
that's safer than the person

00:27:29.570 --> 00:27:31.640
actually driving,
especially if you're

00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:33.540
driving a very long distance.

00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:37.940
And this is something I'm sure
that your company or Waymo is

00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:39.590
working on.

00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:43.970
So there are health
consequences of poor sleep.

00:27:43.970 --> 00:27:48.290
Body systems associated with
major diseases such as diabetes

00:27:48.290 --> 00:27:50.120
are affected.

00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:51.890
People tend to
become overweight,

00:27:51.890 --> 00:27:55.266
and we know that the immune
system doesn't function as well

00:27:55.266 --> 00:27:56.390
when you're sleep deprived.

00:27:56.390 --> 00:27:59.990
For example, if you vaccinate
someone for influenza

00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:03.260
and they've been sleep deprived,
their response to the vaccine

00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:07.580
is not as vigorous
when they have

00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:12.110
been sleep deprived compared
to if they've slept normally.

00:28:12.110 --> 00:28:15.350
Common Circadian
Disorders-- shift work,

00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:18.810
I don't imagine anybody here
is an actual shift worker.

00:28:18.810 --> 00:28:23.500
Although, I'm guessing many
of you control your own hours.

00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:26.270
Shift work is
really like jet lag

00:28:26.270 --> 00:28:32.210
except it's a lot less fun
than going to another place.

00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:36.080
So when you see
your own doctor--

00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:39.410
when you see your own doctor,
ask yourself the question,

00:28:39.410 --> 00:28:41.960
when was the last
time your own doctor

00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:44.190
asked you anything about sleep?

00:28:44.190 --> 00:28:47.450
And these are some of the things
that the doctor should really

00:28:47.450 --> 00:28:48.800
explore--

00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:49.730
do you snore?

00:28:49.730 --> 00:28:51.530
Do you or others--

00:28:51.530 --> 00:28:54.250
has anybody observed
you to stop breathing?

00:28:54.250 --> 00:28:57.350
Do you fall asleep when you
shouldn't-- watching TV,

00:28:57.350 --> 00:28:59.270
driving, and so forth?

00:28:59.270 --> 00:29:03.960
Do you have difficulty sleeping
more than three nights a week?

00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:08.240
Do you have an unpleasant
tingling or creeping sensation

00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:11.270
in your legs when
you're trying to sleep?

00:29:11.270 --> 00:29:13.490
And are there things that
interrupt your sleep?

00:29:13.490 --> 00:29:17.750
And there's a gazillion things
that can interrupt your sleep--

00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:22.340
heartburn, bad dreams, pain,
discomfort, noise, you name it,

00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:25.460
your dog, your cat,
all of these things

00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:27.530
can interrupt with your sleep.

00:29:27.530 --> 00:29:29.430
So what do we see
at a sleep clinic?

00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:32.960
And I just want to
give a shout-out here.

00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:37.280
Dr. Rafael Pelayo is here from
Stanford, and he's right there.

00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:42.740
And Stanford, believe it or
not, the very first real sleep

00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:44.850
clinic in the world
was at Stanford.

00:29:44.850 --> 00:29:46.400
What was it, about 1970?

00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:47.690
AUDIENCE: 1970.

00:29:47.690 --> 00:29:49.120
MEIR KRYGER: Yeah, 1970.

00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:54.230
And it's the sleep clinic
in the United States.

00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:56.660
And so what do we see
in a sleep clinic?

00:29:56.660 --> 00:29:59.900
What are the complaints that
people are coming in with?

00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:05.010
The number one thing that we
see is daytime sleepiness.

00:30:05.010 --> 00:30:07.740
In other words, somebody
falling asleep at the wrong time

00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:12.630
in the wrong place, or unable to
focus and concentrate, snoring,

00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:15.750
insomnia-- and I'll cover all
of these very briefly in a few

00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:16.530
minutes--

00:30:16.530 --> 00:30:18.030
and weird behaviors.

00:30:18.030 --> 00:30:21.460
And I'll go into some of the
weird behaviors in a minute.

00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:23.360
So what are the diagnoses?

00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:27.300
They're listed here, and I'm
going to mention all of these.

00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:28.740
So don't worry
about it, and there

00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:31.650
won't be a test at the
end of this session.

00:30:31.650 --> 00:30:34.260
So we see it's something
called obstructive sleep apnea

00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:35.980
where people stop breathing.

00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:38.910
We see insomnia-- difficulty
in falling asleep and staying

00:30:38.910 --> 00:30:42.210
asleep, restless leg syndrome
where the person can't

00:30:42.210 --> 00:30:45.455
get comfortable because their
legs are driving them crazy

00:30:45.455 --> 00:30:47.160
as they're trying to sleep.

00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:50.070
Narcolepsy-- a condition
usually starting off

00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:53.280
in the teenage years,
resulting in very, very

00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:54.750
severe sleepiness.

00:30:54.750 --> 00:30:57.840
And something called REM
sleep behavior disorder

00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:02.400
where people respond to what
they are actually dreaming.

00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:06.260
So snoring-- how many
people here snore?

00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:06.900
OK.

00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:11.880
So there's four or five
people here who are snoring.

00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:15.920
So snoring is caused by
a blockage of breathing

00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:17.330
when you're sleeping.

00:31:17.330 --> 00:31:19.220
It's extremely common.

00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:22.970
About 90 million Americans
supposedly snore.

00:31:22.970 --> 00:31:25.850
It's more common in
those who are overweight,

00:31:25.850 --> 00:31:30.920
have a big neck, a long,
thin face, and a small jaw.

00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:34.220
And those are some of the things
that contribute to snoring.

00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:36.590
Now, normally, we
don't worry a whole lot

00:31:36.590 --> 00:31:40.640
about snoring unless the snoring
is associated with something

00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:43.940
else or is a symptom
of something else,

00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:47.407
and the main symptom that we
worry about is sleep apnea.

00:31:47.407 --> 00:31:48.240
Whoopsy daisy, here.

00:31:51.306 --> 00:31:54.030
It is sleep apnea,
and sleep apnea

00:31:54.030 --> 00:31:55.890
is extraordinarily common.

00:31:55.890 --> 00:31:58.470
In this condition,
people stop breathing

00:31:58.470 --> 00:32:02.130
because their upper
airway actually obstructs.

00:32:02.130 --> 00:32:06.720
It's found in 18 million
Americans-- probably 12 million

00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:09.130
males, 6 million females.

00:32:09.130 --> 00:32:12.000
And when you stop breathing,
your blood oxygen level

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:15.060
drops, puts a strain on the
heart, raises blood pressure.

00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:17.580
So all of these bad
things are happening

00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:21.420
when you stop breathing, so it's
something that we worry about.

00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:25.470
This was the old stereotype of
someone who had sleep apnea--

00:32:25.470 --> 00:32:30.750
an obese middle-aged gentleman,
but we see it in teenagers.

00:32:30.750 --> 00:32:32.610
These are all patients of mine.

00:32:32.610 --> 00:32:33.660
You see it in teenagers.

00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:37.300
You see it in people that have
a small lower jaw, for example,

00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:40.080
and that's actually a
very common cause of sleep

00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:44.460
apnea both in adults
and also in children who

00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:47.700
have what you might
call a big overbite

00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:50.890
or what we might
call an overjet.

00:32:50.890 --> 00:32:53.590
And so that, again,
is quite common.

00:32:53.590 --> 00:32:55.230
So how do we treat sleep apnea?

00:32:55.230 --> 00:32:59.030
We treat them with a mask
that fits over the nose.

00:32:59.030 --> 00:33:03.300
This is actually a video
that's not making any noise.

00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:05.910
Can you see her chest moving?

00:33:05.910 --> 00:33:09.360
Anyway, so basically,
this is something

00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:12.370
that we see all the time.

00:33:12.370 --> 00:33:14.220
Every single clinic
that we have,

00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:16.920
we see one or two
or three patients

00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:20.560
that have this condition.

00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:21.830
So where are we now?

00:33:21.830 --> 00:33:24.010
So over the last 30
or 40 years, there

00:33:24.010 --> 00:33:28.820
has been a big change in our
therapy of this condition.

00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:30.640
The first treatment
that we used to use

00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:33.540
was putting a hole in
the throat right here.

00:33:33.540 --> 00:33:36.070
It's called a
tracheostomy which avoided

00:33:36.070 --> 00:33:37.690
the upper airway
breathing passage,

00:33:37.690 --> 00:33:41.339
and it was very effective but
obviously, very, very invasive.

00:33:41.339 --> 00:33:42.880
In the first patient
that I ever had,

00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:46.330
that's how we
treated that patient.

00:33:46.330 --> 00:33:49.600
And so there have been all
of these other technologies

00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:52.600
that I'm not going to go
into, but the most interesting

00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:56.080
recent one has been
hypoglossal nerve stimulation.

00:33:56.080 --> 00:34:00.010
So the hypoglossal nerve is a
nerve that goes to the tongue.

00:34:00.010 --> 00:34:05.350
And so a couple of years ago, a
company came out with a system

00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:09.020
that actually
stimulated that nerve,

00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:14.139
and the system is based on a
pacemaker-like device right

00:34:14.139 --> 00:34:18.670
here and one lead that goes
down to between the ribs which

00:34:18.670 --> 00:34:19.960
indicates--

00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:24.280
it's got a pressure transducer
that indicates whether or not

00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:26.560
the person's trying to breathe.

00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:30.880
And then the pacemaker
says, uh-huh, the guy

00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:31.810
is trying to breathe.

00:34:31.810 --> 00:34:34.090
I'm going to push
the tongue forward,

00:34:34.090 --> 00:34:36.380
and that is in
fact what happened.

00:34:36.380 --> 00:34:40.510
So there's a sensing of
inspiration, the pacer fires,

00:34:40.510 --> 00:34:44.050
and it stimulates the branch
of the hypoglossal nerve,

00:34:44.050 --> 00:34:47.350
and it actually pushes
the tongue forward--

00:34:47.350 --> 00:34:48.880
pushes the tongue forward.

00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:50.530
So this is a
treatment that's been

00:34:50.530 --> 00:34:53.170
in use for a couple of years.

00:34:53.170 --> 00:34:56.100
It was approved by the
FDA roughly two years ago,

00:34:56.100 --> 00:34:58.630
and you're going to hear
more and more about it.

00:34:58.630 --> 00:35:03.310
It doesn't work in someone who's
really dramatically overweight,

00:35:03.310 --> 00:35:04.630
however.

00:35:04.630 --> 00:35:07.540
So this is how we
treat sleep apnea,

00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:10.570
and I've mentioned
all of these before.

00:35:10.570 --> 00:35:13.960
And I'm going to zip
through to insomnia.

00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:16.360
So insomnia is
difficulty in falling

00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:20.810
asleep, awakenings during the
night, can't get back to sleep.

00:35:20.810 --> 00:35:24.760
And also, the feeling of,
I've been in bed all night,

00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:27.460
I wake up, I feel
like I haven't slept.

00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:30.190
And it's the sensation--
that perception--

00:35:30.190 --> 00:35:34.970
of inadequate sleep that
many people complain about.

00:35:34.970 --> 00:35:36.770
How common is it?

00:35:36.770 --> 00:35:39.950
During the course of the year,
about 40% of the population

00:35:39.950 --> 00:35:41.600
will complain about this.

00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:44.180
However, in only about--

00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:48.050
not only, this is a lot of
people-- between 10% and 15%

00:35:48.050 --> 00:35:52.670
of the American population has
insomnia on a chronic basis.

00:35:52.670 --> 00:35:58.400
So if this were the course
that they teach at Stanford

00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:04.370
and someone in the audience fell
asleep, they would be squirted.

00:36:04.370 --> 00:36:07.500
Anyways, I'm not
going to do that here.

00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:11.570
I'm not going to do that here
because the students here

00:36:11.570 --> 00:36:14.030
are not paying to come
and listen to me here,

00:36:14.030 --> 00:36:15.140
so that's fine.

00:36:15.140 --> 00:36:18.920
So who's at risk
of having insomnia?

00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:21.380
So it's women-- women
are almost twice

00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:24.620
as likely to have
insomnia as men.

00:36:24.620 --> 00:36:28.460
Older adults are, again,
very likely to have insomnia,

00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:31.580
and it's not just purely age.

00:36:31.580 --> 00:36:35.570
It's age, plus
diseases they may have,

00:36:35.570 --> 00:36:38.960
plus medications that they
may be taking that may

00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:41.300
be causing the problem.

00:36:41.300 --> 00:36:43.850
And people with certain
mental disorders--

00:36:43.850 --> 00:36:46.190
for example, depression--
are much, much

00:36:46.190 --> 00:36:50.810
more likely to have insomnia.

00:36:50.810 --> 00:36:53.390
So how do we treat insomnia?

00:36:53.390 --> 00:36:56.300
Well, sometimes
insomnia is actually

00:36:56.300 --> 00:36:58.910
associated with
another condition,

00:36:58.910 --> 00:37:02.300
and the other condition can
be, as I mentioned, depression,

00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:04.940
chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, arthritis, heart

00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:05.820
failure.

00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:11.030
So we almost always will treat
that additional condition.

00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:13.430
There are pharmacologic
treatments.

00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:16.310
The over-the-counter
medications are either

00:37:16.310 --> 00:37:22.210
going to be melatonin and/or
a Benadryl-type compound--

00:37:22.210 --> 00:37:26.150
a sedating anti-histamine.

00:37:26.150 --> 00:37:31.460
And the over-the-counters are
not terrifically effective

00:37:31.460 --> 00:37:33.050
sleeping pills.

00:37:33.050 --> 00:37:35.990
And the most commonly
used treatment now

00:37:35.990 --> 00:37:39.290
is behavioral
treatment, and I'm not

00:37:39.290 --> 00:37:42.440
going to go into this except to
say that we call it cognitive

00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:43.970
behavioral therapy.

00:37:43.970 --> 00:37:48.050
And it's done by psychologists
who have additional training,

00:37:48.050 --> 00:37:54.350
and one of the world's experts
in cognitive behavioral therapy

00:37:54.350 --> 00:37:56.450
is at Stanford--

00:37:56.450 --> 00:37:59.810
Dr. Manber, Rachel Manber.

00:37:59.810 --> 00:38:02.870
So restless legs syndrome--
an irresistible urge

00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:04.550
to move the legs
when you're sleeping.

00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:07.710
Anybody here have that?

00:38:07.710 --> 00:38:09.440
You have that?

00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:12.761
OK, your friend has that.

00:38:12.761 --> 00:38:13.260
OK.

00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:17.400
So restless legs
syndrome is interesting.

00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:21.570
It's found in probably about
10% to 15% of the population.

00:38:21.570 --> 00:38:22.810
It can be genetic.

00:38:22.810 --> 00:38:24.480
It can run in families.

00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:28.530
Very common in people of a
French-Canadian background,

00:38:28.530 --> 00:38:29.970
for example.

00:38:29.970 --> 00:38:32.430
And it's a
neurological disorder,

00:38:32.430 --> 00:38:35.190
and I don't know whether
the video-- oh, the video

00:38:35.190 --> 00:38:36.060
is working.

00:38:36.060 --> 00:38:37.750
So the lady on the left--

00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:41.820
OK, the lady on the
left, she feels hot.

00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:44.190
When we measure the
temperature of her legs,

00:38:44.190 --> 00:38:46.740
they feel perfectly normal.

00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:50.160
And so it's almost like
what we call a neuropathy.

00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:53.670
There's something-- that is, she
has the perception that there's

00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:55.740
something abnormal going on.

00:38:55.740 --> 00:38:58.540
When we take a patient
with this complaint

00:38:58.540 --> 00:39:00.570
and we monitor
them during sleep,

00:39:00.570 --> 00:39:02.640
I don't know if you
noticed, but this gentleman

00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:06.420
had a twitch in his legs
about every 20 seconds.

00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:09.270
Had a twitch in his legs
about every 20 seconds.

00:39:09.270 --> 00:39:14.070
And so that's what people with
restless legs syndrome do,

00:39:14.070 --> 00:39:17.400
and it's not a whole lot of
fun to be in the same bed

00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:23.540
with someone who moves a lot
like this, as you can imagine.

00:39:23.540 --> 00:39:26.390
So narcolepsy is a
very common condition

00:39:26.390 --> 00:39:29.630
in a university setting.

00:39:29.630 --> 00:39:32.270
For example, at
Yale, we have a lot

00:39:32.270 --> 00:39:34.321
of patients with narcolepsy.

00:39:34.321 --> 00:39:34.820
Why?

00:39:34.820 --> 00:39:37.070
Because it usually
begins in people

00:39:37.070 --> 00:39:43.040
who are young adults or late
teenagers, and the symptom

00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:44.980
is severe daytime sleepiness.

00:39:44.980 --> 00:39:48.290
In other words, they're
sleepy 100% of the time,

00:39:48.290 --> 00:39:52.070
and suddenly, they may lose
muscle tone and collapse.

00:39:52.070 --> 00:39:54.320
We call that narcolepsy,
and the collapse

00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:57.530
occurs in response to
hearing a joke, becoming

00:39:57.530 --> 00:40:02.180
angry, or excited, and they
also will have very vivid dream

00:40:02.180 --> 00:40:05.150
imagery as they're
falling asleep

00:40:05.150 --> 00:40:08.750
or even after they've
awakened in the morning.

00:40:08.750 --> 00:40:10.370
Remember, I mentioned
before that we

00:40:10.370 --> 00:40:13.310
don't have our first episode
of rapid eye movement sleep

00:40:13.310 --> 00:40:14.900
until 90 minutes?

00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:19.760
These patients will have dreams
actually at the beginning

00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:24.550
of the night and sometimes
before they're actually asleep.

00:40:24.550 --> 00:40:27.510
So it's a chronic disorder.

00:40:27.510 --> 00:40:30.960
It's an immunological
disorder in humans,

00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:33.210
and we're actually fairly
good at treating it.

00:40:33.210 --> 00:40:35.670
We can't cure it,
but we can treat it.

00:40:35.670 --> 00:40:38.130
And we can get rid
of the symptoms.

00:40:38.130 --> 00:40:41.400
Oh, so this is a gentleman
that has REM sleep behavior

00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:42.360
disorder.

00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:46.080
I mentioned before that people
are paralyzed during REM sleep,

00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:47.940
and some people are not.

00:40:47.940 --> 00:40:51.920
Keep looking at
this guy up there.

00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:55.314
He's starting to twitch
and he's dreaming.

00:40:55.314 --> 00:40:56.730
He's dreaming he's
being attacked.

00:41:04.830 --> 00:41:08.040
So this is a very
frightening symptom

00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:11.240
to anybody who's in the
same house as this patient.

00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:13.415
And over the years,
I've had patients

00:41:13.415 --> 00:41:18.440
who have been hurt by
their bed partner who

00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:20.600
had a dream that they
were being attacked,

00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:24.830
and they were, therefore,
attacking the person sleeping

00:41:24.830 --> 00:41:26.090
next to them.

00:41:26.090 --> 00:41:29.390
So this condition is common
in people with a disease

00:41:29.390 --> 00:41:31.850
that's called
Parkinson's disease,

00:41:31.850 --> 00:41:36.200
and many without Parkinson's
disease will develop during

00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:39.190
the course of their lifetime--
who have this symptom--

00:41:39.190 --> 00:41:42.890
another what we call
neurodegenerative disease.

00:41:42.890 --> 00:41:48.150
And it can lead to
injuries if it's untreated.

00:41:48.150 --> 00:41:53.370
So sleep problems can
be an important issue,

00:41:53.370 --> 00:41:57.870
and the reason why your doctor
needs to ask you about things

00:41:57.870 --> 00:42:01.230
is that we can treat
all of these conditions

00:42:01.230 --> 00:42:02.070
that I've mentioned.

00:42:02.070 --> 00:42:04.750
And we're pretty good
at treating them.

00:42:04.750 --> 00:42:07.050
So if anybody here
has any symptom,

00:42:07.050 --> 00:42:11.250
the Stanford Sleep
Clinic in Redwood City

00:42:11.250 --> 00:42:15.180
is like world famous, and that's
where you ought to be going.

00:42:15.180 --> 00:42:17.680
So at the sleep center,
what do they do?

00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:20.790
They do a test that's called
polysomonography where

00:42:20.790 --> 00:42:22.960
they measure a bunch of things.

00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:25.140
This can be done
either in the lab

00:42:25.140 --> 00:42:29.670
itself or you could be sent home
with equipment to monitor you

00:42:29.670 --> 00:42:30.670
at home.

00:42:30.670 --> 00:42:31.920
Whoopsy daisy.

00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:36.000
So there's a test that
is done that measures

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:37.200
daytime sleepiness.

00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:41.280
So for example, if
someone is driving a truck

00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:43.650
or is a pilot who has a
condition where there's

00:42:43.650 --> 00:42:46.350
a concern about whether
they can stay awake or not,

00:42:46.350 --> 00:42:50.850
we could document objectively
whether they are sleepy.

00:42:50.850 --> 00:42:53.850
And these are the
treatments that are

00:42:53.850 --> 00:42:57.360
available through the clinic.

00:42:57.360 --> 00:43:02.310
So I'm going to end
by just saying this--

00:43:02.310 --> 00:43:06.630
sleep is a basic biological
need, and you need to have it.

00:43:06.630 --> 00:43:08.820
And you need to have
the right amount of it.

00:43:08.820 --> 00:43:10.560
If you don't sleep
enough, there are

00:43:10.560 --> 00:43:13.380
serious negative consequences.

00:43:13.380 --> 00:43:18.010
Your doctor should identify
if you have a sleep problem.

00:43:18.010 --> 00:43:19.530
And the only way
to identify it is

00:43:19.530 --> 00:43:22.500
for he or she to
ask you the question

00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:24.840
or for you to bring it up.

00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:27.992
And how many people do you
know who have a sleep problem,

00:43:27.992 --> 00:43:29.700
and how many of them
have been diagnosed?

00:43:29.700 --> 00:43:31.500
Anybody here have
a family member

00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:34.650
who is being treated
for a sleep problem?

00:43:34.650 --> 00:43:37.190
OK, it's about three
or four of you.

00:43:37.190 --> 00:43:40.290
Any of you know people
that probably have a sleep

00:43:40.290 --> 00:43:42.512
problem that should be treated?

00:43:42.512 --> 00:43:45.550
OK, so a whole bunch more
hands, which sort of brings

00:43:45.550 --> 00:43:48.730
up the point that many
people with sleep disorders

00:43:48.730 --> 00:43:51.440
have not been diagnosed.

00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:53.770
So I'm going to
end this segment,

00:43:53.770 --> 00:43:56.770
and we're now going
to be interactive.

00:43:56.770 --> 00:44:03.220
And I think what we're going
to do is take questions,

00:44:03.220 --> 00:44:07.810
and we'll see how far we can
get on with the questions.

00:44:07.810 --> 00:44:11.710
So most of you have
gotten this handout.

00:44:11.710 --> 00:44:14.390
And this handout
is from my book,

00:44:14.390 --> 00:44:16.749
which is "The 13
Commandments for People who

00:44:16.749 --> 00:44:18.040
are Having Trouble with Sleep."

00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:19.730
But I want to hear from you.

00:44:19.730 --> 00:44:21.820
I want you to ask me
questions, and I'll

00:44:21.820 --> 00:44:23.695
do my best to answer them.

00:44:23.695 --> 00:44:27.070
AUDIENCE: I have a question
about the mid-afternoon lull.

00:44:27.070 --> 00:44:28.750
Is it known what
the function of that

00:44:28.750 --> 00:44:32.050
is, or evolutionary advantage,
or any recommendations

00:44:32.050 --> 00:44:35.020
with what we should do when
we're experiencing that?

00:44:35.020 --> 00:44:38.890
MEIR KRYGER: Well,
so the question

00:44:38.890 --> 00:44:43.460
is, does the mid-afternoon
lull have any function?

00:44:43.460 --> 00:44:47.620
And the answer is, I don't know
if it has any positive function

00:44:47.620 --> 00:44:48.460
or not.

00:44:48.460 --> 00:44:50.050
But it is there,
and it's a function

00:44:50.050 --> 00:44:51.880
of our circadian rhythm.

00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:55.000
And if you feel that
you're having an afternoon,

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:59.800
sort of, reduction in alertness,
probably the smartest thing

00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:02.090
to do if it's affecting you--

00:45:02.090 --> 00:45:05.710
for example, your work, your
concentration, your driving,

00:45:05.710 --> 00:45:08.710
and all of a sudden you're
exhausted-- the best thing

00:45:08.710 --> 00:45:12.070
to do is to take a nap of
about anywhere between 15

00:45:12.070 --> 00:45:13.360
and 30 minutes.

00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:18.400
And it'll refresh
you, but you have

00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:20.770
to be aware of this
mid-afternoon lull

00:45:20.770 --> 00:45:24.840
because it can really
affect your performance.

00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:29.307
Yeah, so I'm going to give
the mic to Dr. Pelayo.

00:45:29.307 --> 00:45:31.390
RAFAEL PELAYO: Just a
little speculation on that--

00:45:31.390 --> 00:45:33.806
the inherent paradox of sleep
is that sleeping animals can

00:45:33.806 --> 00:45:35.270
be attacked while
they're sleeping,

00:45:35.270 --> 00:45:37.810
and our predators like
to attack us at night.

00:45:37.810 --> 00:45:40.879
So we have a surge of
alertness in the evening,

00:45:40.879 --> 00:45:42.670
and our predators will
stagger to attack us

00:45:42.670 --> 00:45:44.500
in the afternoon which
happens in a lull.

00:45:44.500 --> 00:45:46.780
So I think what we're
doing is, we have a lull,

00:45:46.780 --> 00:45:48.500
so later, we have a surge later.

00:45:48.500 --> 00:45:49.540
So it compliments that.

00:45:49.540 --> 00:45:51.726
It's just speculation.

00:45:51.726 --> 00:45:53.350
AUDIENCE: Following
up on that premise,

00:45:53.350 --> 00:45:55.960
wouldn't that suggest that
napping in the afternoon

00:45:55.960 --> 00:45:57.490
is really the right
thing to do from

00:45:57.490 --> 00:46:01.360
an evolutionary standpoint?

00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:02.470
RAFAEL PELAYO: Yeah.

00:46:02.470 --> 00:46:03.380
Yeah.

00:46:03.380 --> 00:46:05.380
We agree napping is good.

00:46:05.380 --> 00:46:06.640
MEIR KRYGER: Napping is good.

00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:07.720
Napping is really good.

00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:10.216
A long nap is not good.

00:46:10.216 --> 00:46:11.590
So if you nap two
or three hours,

00:46:11.590 --> 00:46:13.173
you're going to wake
up feeling really

00:46:13.173 --> 00:46:16.670
groggy because of a phenomenon
that's called sleep inertia.

00:46:16.670 --> 00:46:19.870
So the ideal length
of a nap is probably

00:46:19.870 --> 00:46:22.910
somewhere between
30 and 40 minutes.

00:46:22.910 --> 00:46:27.670
AUDIENCE: I always wake up
with an alarm or silent alarm,

00:46:27.670 --> 00:46:29.710
are there any
guidelines like not

00:46:29.710 --> 00:46:33.460
to have it fire off
in the middle of REM

00:46:33.460 --> 00:46:34.600
or things like that?

00:46:34.600 --> 00:46:36.850
MEIR KRYGER: Well,
there are gadgets

00:46:36.850 --> 00:46:41.920
that claim that they wake
you up during the ideal time.

00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:46.090
But in reality,
unless they're somehow

00:46:46.090 --> 00:46:48.850
monitoring your brain waves
and your eye movements,

00:46:48.850 --> 00:46:51.670
they really don't know
whether you're in REM sleep.

00:46:51.670 --> 00:46:56.050
There are several devices
that claim to do that.

00:46:56.050 --> 00:47:03.430
The data suggests that if you
wake up from very deep sleep,

00:47:03.430 --> 00:47:05.770
you're going to wake
up feeling groggy,

00:47:05.770 --> 00:47:07.510
and probably the
best thing to wake

00:47:07.510 --> 00:47:09.940
up from is rapid
eye movement sleep

00:47:09.940 --> 00:47:11.980
or a lighter stage of sleep.

00:47:11.980 --> 00:47:14.160
But you'll only
have very deep sleep

00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:17.920
usually in the first
third of the night

00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:19.990
unless you're
sleeping like a cat--

00:47:19.990 --> 00:47:22.510
two or three hours here, two
or three hours there, and so

00:47:22.510 --> 00:47:24.690
forth.

00:47:24.690 --> 00:47:26.820
AUDIENCE: So basically,
there's nothing

00:47:26.820 --> 00:47:28.710
that I can do to predict it?

00:47:28.710 --> 00:47:32.130
Like 7 and 1/2 hours
or something like that.

00:47:32.130 --> 00:47:35.520
MEIR KRYGER: Well, I
mean, the ideal way

00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:37.590
to know whether you're
getting enough sleep

00:47:37.590 --> 00:47:39.690
is how do you feel
when you wake up,

00:47:39.690 --> 00:47:42.420
and how do you feel
during the day?

00:47:42.420 --> 00:47:45.470
If you wake up feeling
good, wide awake, and alert,

00:47:45.470 --> 00:47:48.480
you have gotten enough sleep.

00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:50.100
AUDIENCE: So I did
have a period where

00:47:50.100 --> 00:47:53.820
I was sleeping regularly very
little-- like 3 and 1/2, 4

00:47:53.820 --> 00:47:55.110
hours.

00:47:55.110 --> 00:47:58.810
And now switch-- but I
don't feel any difference,

00:47:58.810 --> 00:48:02.490
to be honest, just because the
people told me it's unhealthy.

00:48:02.490 --> 00:48:06.000
And it dates way back
to military time,

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:08.570
so why am I not
feeling different,

00:48:08.570 --> 00:48:11.632
and is it possible that some
people can get away with--

00:48:11.632 --> 00:48:12.840
MEIR KRYGER: It is possible--

00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:13.740
AUDIENCE: And stay healthy?

00:48:13.740 --> 00:48:15.930
I mean, I'm doing it just
because of what I read,

00:48:15.930 --> 00:48:16.590
what I hear.

00:48:16.590 --> 00:48:17.070
MEIR KRYGER: Yeah.

00:48:17.070 --> 00:48:18.570
AUDIENCE: Not because
I felt groggy.

00:48:18.570 --> 00:48:21.000
MEIR KRYGER: So it is
possible that three or four

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:26.190
hours of sleep out of
24 is OK, but I don't

00:48:26.190 --> 00:48:29.360
want to be flying my airplane.

00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:32.960
In other words, that
for the average person,

00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:35.300
three to four hours
is simply not enough

00:48:35.300 --> 00:48:36.440
and they're impaired.

00:48:36.440 --> 00:48:40.040
And they may not be aware
that they are impaired.

00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:46.370
So that's what the big concern
is from a public health

00:48:46.370 --> 00:48:48.350
perspective.

00:48:48.350 --> 00:48:51.420
AUDIENCE: So a question
to follow up on that--

00:48:51.420 --> 00:48:55.050
what could any of
us do to bridge

00:48:55.050 --> 00:48:59.087
the gap between our subjective
feeling of whether we're

00:48:59.087 --> 00:49:01.170
performing well and knowing
whether we're actually

00:49:01.170 --> 00:49:02.530
performing well?

00:49:02.530 --> 00:49:04.920
So I might feel OK
in the afternoon,

00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:07.545
but I can't measure a 20%
dip in my performance.

00:49:07.545 --> 00:49:08.550
It's just how I feel.

00:49:08.550 --> 00:49:11.760
MEIR KRYGER: Strangely enough,
other people in your home

00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:14.880
can probably tell when
you're sleep deprived,

00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:17.370
and sometimes,
asking those people

00:49:17.370 --> 00:49:22.470
or asking even colleagues--
you know, how am I doing?

00:49:22.470 --> 00:49:23.850
Do you think I've slept enough?

00:49:23.850 --> 00:49:28.050
May actually give you
additional useful information.

00:49:28.050 --> 00:49:30.930
If you wanted to try to
get objective information,

00:49:30.930 --> 00:49:33.780
you can actually
download one of the apps

00:49:33.780 --> 00:49:36.180
that I mentioned
where you can actually

00:49:36.180 --> 00:49:38.190
measure your own reaction time.

00:49:38.190 --> 00:49:40.950
And you could see
how you compare

00:49:40.950 --> 00:49:44.730
to a very big population.

00:49:44.730 --> 00:49:48.480
But other people can usually
tell when you're really tired.

00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:51.420
And this is something that
we see in a hospital setting

00:49:51.420 --> 00:49:52.480
all the time.

00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:56.430
So when I've attended
an internal medicine

00:49:56.430 --> 00:49:58.380
and we're making
rounds in the morning,

00:49:58.380 --> 00:50:01.350
there's been someone
who's been awake all night

00:50:01.350 --> 00:50:06.000
and the day before
taking care of patients.

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:10.410
And very often, they
may not perceive

00:50:10.410 --> 00:50:13.320
that they're doing
anything abnormal,

00:50:13.320 --> 00:50:15.180
but the other
people in the group

00:50:15.180 --> 00:50:18.930
can tell that the person
doesn't remember things,

00:50:18.930 --> 00:50:20.350
is making mistakes.

00:50:20.350 --> 00:50:23.700
So it's always good to
have other people around

00:50:23.700 --> 00:50:27.540
to sort of be there to
kind of let you know

00:50:27.540 --> 00:50:30.661
whether you're performing well.

00:50:30.661 --> 00:50:33.160
AUDIENCE: In a chance that we
do have to pull an all-nighter

00:50:33.160 --> 00:50:36.740
or maybe even get three,
four hours of sleep a night,

00:50:36.740 --> 00:50:38.490
what is the best way
to recover from that?

00:50:38.490 --> 00:50:41.910
Is it to add like one additional
hour for the rest of a week?

00:50:41.910 --> 00:50:45.840
Or do we try to get 14 hours
of sleep the next night

00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:47.250
to recover?

00:50:47.250 --> 00:50:49.600
MEIR KRYGER: I think that's
a very personal thing.

00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:53.160
And I know that for myself,
if I've lost a lot of sleep

00:50:53.160 --> 00:50:56.340
in a given night-- let's say
I'm going overseas or something,

00:50:56.340 --> 00:51:00.420
and I'm on one of these six-hour
flights and you only get

00:51:00.420 --> 00:51:02.820
to sleep like four or
something like that--

00:51:02.820 --> 00:51:07.890
I find that the next day,
getting a really long night

00:51:07.890 --> 00:51:12.780
of sleep starting at the
bedtime of my destination

00:51:12.780 --> 00:51:14.250
is the best thing that I can do.

00:51:14.250 --> 00:51:16.650
And very often when
I do that, I will

00:51:16.650 --> 00:51:21.130
sleep 10, 11, maybe even
12 hours during that night.

00:51:21.130 --> 00:51:23.550
So it's a very,
very personal thing.

00:51:23.550 --> 00:51:29.190
If catching up is an extra
hour, but that extra hour still

00:51:29.190 --> 00:51:30.930
doesn't put you into
the normal range,

00:51:30.930 --> 00:51:33.130
you're not going to correct.

00:51:33.130 --> 00:51:36.330
So you have to make sure that
the sleep that you're actually

00:51:36.330 --> 00:51:40.080
getting is going to correct
your sleep deprivation.

00:51:40.080 --> 00:51:42.120
AUDIENCE: OK,
snoring, sleep apnea,

00:51:42.120 --> 00:51:44.130
and restless legs
syndrome are all true.

00:51:44.130 --> 00:51:45.900
Insomnia is not there.

00:51:45.900 --> 00:51:47.800
MEIR KRYGER: Oh, I
should put insomnia.

00:51:47.800 --> 00:51:50.010
We can treat insomnia.

00:51:50.010 --> 00:51:52.050
We can treat insomnia.

00:51:52.050 --> 00:51:54.690
I'll have to make
that correction.

00:51:54.690 --> 00:51:57.420
And the way we treat insomnia
is what I mentioned--

00:51:57.420 --> 00:51:59.640
is the first thing
we do is what we

00:51:59.640 --> 00:52:01.350
call cognitive
behavioral therapy

00:52:01.350 --> 00:52:04.110
and sleep hygiene, which
is some of the stuff that's

00:52:04.110 --> 00:52:08.970
on the sheet that was
actually handed out.

00:52:08.970 --> 00:52:15.510
And so giving sleeping
pills is not the first thing

00:52:15.510 --> 00:52:17.490
that we do when
someone has insomnia,

00:52:17.490 --> 00:52:20.820
it's the last thing that we
do when someone has insomnia.

00:52:20.820 --> 00:52:23.610
We want to make
sure that we cover

00:52:23.610 --> 00:52:27.240
any comorbidity or any other
disease that they may have,

00:52:27.240 --> 00:52:29.400
and we've corrected
their sleep hygiene,

00:52:29.400 --> 00:52:32.855
and we've done what we call
cognitive behavioral therapy.

00:52:32.855 --> 00:52:34.130
AUDIENCE: So I sleep--

00:52:34.130 --> 00:52:36.960
I need like four or
five hours and wake up

00:52:36.960 --> 00:52:38.170
naturally after that.

00:52:38.170 --> 00:52:39.590
Like, I'll go to sleep at 10.

00:52:39.590 --> 00:52:42.630
I'll naturally just wake up at
2:00 or 3:00 in the morning.

00:52:42.630 --> 00:52:44.920
I go to sleep at midnight,
I'll naturally wake up

00:52:44.920 --> 00:52:46.020
a 4:00 to 5:00.

00:52:46.020 --> 00:52:47.970
MEIR KRYGER: So you
sleep four out of 24?

00:52:47.970 --> 00:52:50.100
AUDIENCE: Four to five
hours out of 24, yeah.

00:52:50.100 --> 00:52:52.099
MEIR KRYGER: Yeah, I
mean, there are people--

00:52:52.099 --> 00:52:53.640
AUDIENCE: Like, I
don't set an alarm.

00:52:53.640 --> 00:52:55.030
I just wake up.

00:52:55.030 --> 00:52:56.490
MEIR KRYGER: Yeah,
there are people

00:52:56.490 --> 00:52:59.790
that can get away with
that, and getting away

00:52:59.790 --> 00:53:01.200
may not be the right term.

00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:03.420
There are some
people who naturally

00:53:03.420 --> 00:53:06.840
seem to function on a
small amount of sleep.

00:53:06.840 --> 00:53:11.760
And the only way to sort of
know whether you might need more

00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:14.730
sleep is for you to participate
in one of these research

00:53:14.730 --> 00:53:17.040
studies where they
keep you in a bed,

00:53:17.040 --> 00:53:21.150
and if you fall asleep over
and above the four hours,

00:53:21.150 --> 00:53:22.680
that's going to tell me--

00:53:22.680 --> 00:53:26.670
because the only way you fall
asleep is if you need sleep.

00:53:26.670 --> 00:53:29.242
If you don't need to sleep,
you will never fall asleep.

00:53:29.242 --> 00:53:31.200
In other words, if you're
wide awake and alert,

00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:32.860
it just isn't going to happen.

00:53:32.860 --> 00:53:34.920
So that's why that
study that I showed you

00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:37.020
from the University
of Pennsylvania

00:53:37.020 --> 00:53:41.340
was so interesting in
that when you force people

00:53:41.340 --> 00:53:44.700
to stay in a bed, they
actually will sleep

00:53:44.700 --> 00:53:46.920
if they're sleep deprived.

00:53:46.920 --> 00:53:49.100
AUDIENCE: My wife is a
nurse, and she works nights

00:53:49.100 --> 00:53:50.310
for the last eight months.

00:53:50.310 --> 00:53:51.810
And it's been a
train wreck, so this

00:53:51.810 --> 00:53:53.820
is all kind of close to home.

00:53:53.820 --> 00:53:58.740
So she goes to sleep and sleeps
four or five hours as well

00:53:58.740 --> 00:54:01.330
and wakes up naturally and
can't fall back asleep.

00:54:01.330 --> 00:54:03.887
So that's usually
between 1 and 2 o'clock,

00:54:03.887 --> 00:54:05.220
and then we have small children.

00:54:05.220 --> 00:54:08.079
So she'll sleep again
between like 7:30 and 10:00,

00:54:08.079 --> 00:54:09.870
and that's the rhythm
she's been following.

00:54:09.870 --> 00:54:12.090
And there's some other
things we've been doing,

00:54:12.090 --> 00:54:14.250
but it doesn't
seem to be working.

00:54:14.250 --> 00:54:17.130
MEIR KRYGER: Yeah, so it's a
very tough problem, and one

00:54:17.130 --> 00:54:19.060
of the things you
might consider--

00:54:19.060 --> 00:54:20.560
well, there's two
things to consider

00:54:20.560 --> 00:54:21.643
in that kind of situation.

00:54:21.643 --> 00:54:25.650
Number one is to seek help
from a sleep disorder center

00:54:25.650 --> 00:54:28.390
where they're used to dealing
with this kind of thing.

00:54:28.390 --> 00:54:31.200
And number two-- and
what I advise people--

00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:34.770
is see if you can get
a permanent day job.

00:54:34.770 --> 00:54:40.370
There are some people who
just can't adapt to unusual--

00:54:40.370 --> 00:54:43.710
not unusual-- to schedules
that are not in sync

00:54:43.710 --> 00:54:46.020
with their own circadian clock.

00:54:46.020 --> 00:54:48.720
There are many people
who are night people.

00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:51.180
And for example, if you look
at people in the entertainment

00:54:51.180 --> 00:54:52.320
business--

00:54:52.320 --> 00:54:57.000
these are people who go to bed
2, 3, 4 o'clock in the morning.

00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:57.660
They love it.

00:54:57.660 --> 00:55:00.870
They wake up at 10:00,
11:00 in the morning-- noon.

00:55:00.870 --> 00:55:03.510
And so that's their
natural rhythm.

00:55:03.510 --> 00:55:07.020
So what I advise
people is try to find

00:55:07.020 --> 00:55:11.100
a job that is in sync
with your natural rhythm,

00:55:11.100 --> 00:55:13.140
and you're going to
feel a lot better.

00:55:13.140 --> 00:55:17.280
And depending on your
family's circumstances,

00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:20.910
that may or may not be
practical, but in the long run,

00:55:20.910 --> 00:55:22.980
it's something that I recommend.

00:55:22.980 --> 00:55:25.860
And I recommend it for
a couple of reasons.

00:55:25.860 --> 00:55:29.460
Besides the fact that it
can acutely cause problems,

00:55:29.460 --> 00:55:32.130
chronically, I've
seen a lot of patients

00:55:32.130 --> 00:55:35.370
who are nurses who've
worked for 30, 40 years,

00:55:35.370 --> 00:55:37.240
and they've had these
terrible shifts.

00:55:37.240 --> 00:55:41.061
And once they retire,
many of them will be under

00:55:41.061 --> 00:55:43.560
the impression that all their
sleep problems are going to go

00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:45.690
away and they don't.

00:55:45.690 --> 00:55:48.240
So that's something
else to consider

00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:52.440
is the long-term implications
of working nights,

00:55:52.440 --> 00:55:56.190
and there's a lot of data coming
out that working nights may not

00:55:56.190 --> 00:55:59.460
be good for overall
health besides, sort of,

00:55:59.460 --> 00:56:01.200
cognitive functioning.

00:56:01.200 --> 00:56:03.514
SPEAKER 1: Also, your book
was just released last week.

00:56:03.514 --> 00:56:05.430
MEIR KRYGER: It was
released a week ago today.

00:56:05.430 --> 00:56:07.250
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, and
what's the name of it?

00:56:07.250 --> 00:56:09.990
MEIR KRYGER: The name of the
book is "The Mystery of Sleep",

00:56:09.990 --> 00:56:14.220
and the purpose of the book is
to arm people with information

00:56:14.220 --> 00:56:16.500
that if they or
somebody in their family

00:56:16.500 --> 00:56:20.250
has a sleep problem,
what they need to do.

00:56:20.250 --> 00:56:22.530
And the most important
thing that people need to do

00:56:22.530 --> 00:56:24.610
is to make sleep a priority.

00:56:24.610 --> 00:56:26.820
In other words, that
you shouldn't ignore it.

00:56:26.820 --> 00:56:28.500
You shouldn't denigrate it.

00:56:28.500 --> 00:56:30.600
Don't aim for
sleeping two or three

00:56:30.600 --> 00:56:33.570
hours like a lot of people do.

00:56:33.570 --> 00:56:35.374
Make sleep a priority
in your life,

00:56:35.374 --> 00:56:37.290
and you'll feel a lot
better and be healthier.

00:56:37.290 --> 00:56:38.165
SPEAKER 1: All right.

00:56:38.165 --> 00:56:40.671
Well, great, join me in thanking
you for being here today

00:56:40.671 --> 00:56:42.420
and sharing some of
that knowledge with us

00:56:42.420 --> 00:56:43.045
here at Google.

00:56:43.045 --> 00:56:44.128
MEIR KRYGER: It was great.
