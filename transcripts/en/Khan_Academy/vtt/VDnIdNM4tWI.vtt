00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.850
Which of the following triangles
are similar to triangle ABC?

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:06.380
So let's just review
what similarity

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:08.580
means when we're
talking about triangles.

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.470
So let's say this
is one triangle.

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:12.180
And I'll assume it's
a right triangle,

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.190
although what I'm about to
say is true for any triangle.

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:17.290
And let's say this
is another one.

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:20.350
You have similar triangles if
all of the corresponding angles

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:21.270
are equivalent.

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.450
So that angle is
equivalent to that angle.

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:25.990
And I drew that
as a right angle.

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.010
Let's say that this angle
is equivalent to this angle.

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.689
And let's say that this angle
is equivalent to that angle.

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:35.240
Then these two
triangles are similar.

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.120
They are not
necessarily congruent.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.970
They don't necessarily
have all of the same sides.

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:41.980
But they do have all
of the same angles.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.688
And when you have all
of the same angles,

00:00:43.688 --> 00:00:47.010
the ratios between corresponding
sides is going to be constant.

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.690
So for example, if this side
has length 2 and this side

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.720
has length 1, you
have a 2 to 1 ratio

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.576
between the second longest
side and the shortest side.

00:00:56.576 --> 00:00:58.700
Then you're also going to
have a 2 to 1 ratio here.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.720
So maybe this has length 3.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.542
Then this one would be 1.5.

00:01:02.542 --> 00:01:06.800
3 to 1.5 is the same
thing as 2 to 1.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.710
Now, let's think
about the triangles

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.220
that they are proposing.

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.805
So the first one
is triangle CDE.

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:28.370
Just like triangle ABC, this is
going to be a right triangle.

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:29.420
How do I know?

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.780
Well, side CB is
perfectly horizontal,

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.190
and side AB is perfectly
vertical-- same thing.

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.332
Side DE is perfectly
horizontal, and side CE

00:01:38.332 --> 00:01:40.580
is perfectly vertical.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.940
Now, you might realize that
you have the same line acting

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.160
as a hypotenuse of both
of these triangles.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.430
So you have the same
line right over here.

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.480
And if we wanted to prove that
the corresponding angles are

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.170
equivalent, we just
have to break out

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.020
a little bit of our geometry.

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.080
We see that we have
these two vertical lines.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.870
So CE, this line segment
CE, you could view it

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.300
as part of a larger line
that goes like this.

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.020
It is parallel to AB.

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.130
So if you view these
as two parallel lines--

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.700
so that is parallel
to this-- and you

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.260
have a transversal
right over here,

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.020
then corresponding angles
are going to be equivalent.

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.220
So this angle right
over here is going

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.150
to be equivalent to that
angle right over there.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.920
Similarly-- I have trouble
saying that word-- segment

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:41.200
DE right over here
is parallel to BC.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.990
And so if you, once again,
look at the blue line

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.460
as a transversal,
this angle is going

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:47.810
to be equivalent to that angle.

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.680
So all of their corresponding
angles are equivalent.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.860
So these are definitely
similar triangles.

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.370
Now, I went through that
fairly long-winded geometry

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:57.790
way of thinking about it.

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.860
But there's an easier
way to think about it.

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:06.920
Any time you have a line and
you construct a right angle,

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.420
where the base of
the right triangle

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.490
is essentially your change in
x between these two points.

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:15.490
So if you think about going
from point C to point A.

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:18.520
And if you first just want to
have a change in x-- so this

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.990
is our change in x right
over there-- and then

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:26.370
you have a change in y-- so
this is our change in y--

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.920
you're going to construct
a right triangle.

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.070
And the ratio between
these two sides

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:32.900
is always going to be the same.

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.030
So delta y, the change in
y, this triangle-- this

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.250
is the Greek letter
delta, just a shorthand

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.430
for saying change in y-- which
is the length of this side,

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.260
over your change in x is
always going to be constant

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.530
when you're dealing with a line.

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.010
So any triangle that's
constructed this way

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.180
from this line, the ratio
between the corresponding sides

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:58.330
are going to be equivalent.

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.219
And they're going to
be similar triangles.

00:04:00.219 --> 00:04:01.760
So that would have
been an easier way

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.230
to think about this
right over here.

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.271
Now let's look at the
other options they give us.

00:04:05.271 --> 00:04:16.190
DFG-- well, there's not really
a lot that we can say about DFG.

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.959
We're not really using the
line anymore as a hypotenuse,

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:22.140
so we're not going to throw
that in there as being similar.

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.350
We could actually look at
the lengths and all of that

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.660
if we wanted, but we'd
see that it's not similar.

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:34.980
CDG-- let me clean
this up a little bit.

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:39.000
CDG I'll do in-- let's
see, I've already

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.250
used-- I'll do it in blue.

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:44.734
So CDG-- this is not
a right triangle.

00:04:44.734 --> 00:04:46.650
This isn't just a change
in x right over here.

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.160
This isn't a horizontal line.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.360
And this one right over
here is not a vertical line.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.349
So once again, this
is not similar.

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:54.140
In fact, this is not
even a right triangle.

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:56.740
So we'll mark both of these out.

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:57.670
And then they say ADF.

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:08.460
Well, once again, ADF, it's a
right triangle between D and F.

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:14.460
It's your change in x going
from D-- so D is at negative 2.

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:15.660
A is at 3.

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.100
This right over here
is your change in x.

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.270
You literally had to go 5.

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:22.130
This length right
over here is 5.

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:25.540
And then this right over
here is now vertical line.

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:27.130
This is a right triangle.

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:30.509
This is your change in y.

00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:32.050
And these two ratios
are always going

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:35.300
to be constant when your
hypotenuse is a line.

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.040
So once again, this is just
one of those classic right

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:40.140
triangles constructed
from the line where

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.020
the base is the change in x.

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:43.590
This height is the change in y.

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:45.520
The hypotenuse is
the line itself.

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.240
These are going to be similar.

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.077
So this is definitely
a similar triangle.

00:05:50.077 --> 00:05:52.160
And now let's actually
input it, just to make sure

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:53.810
that we got the right answer.

00:05:53.810 --> 00:06:00.130
So I'm saying that and that are
similar triangles to triangle

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:01.544
ABC.
