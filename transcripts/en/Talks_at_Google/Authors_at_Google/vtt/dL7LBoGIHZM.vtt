00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:07.560
JENNY BLAKE: Thank you.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:08.560
Thank you for having me.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.670
It's really an honor to be back,
and it's so exciting for me.

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.740
It's one of my
messages in the book.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.370
That "PIVOT," and our
jobs, and the economy,

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:19.980
it's so fluid now
that this, to me,

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.920
is really a joy, that
even though I left Google

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.680
as a full time employee, to
still come back, and partner,

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.810
and talk, and be here.

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.360
As I was reflecting
on what would

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.920
be most meaningful
to share today,

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.190
it occurred to me that
to the outside world,

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.250
hitting a pivot point
or plateau at Google

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.380
is a bit of an oxymoron.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.570
You should be nothing but 100%
fulfilled and 100% grateful

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.620
100% of the time.

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.240
Hashtag blessed.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.760
But in some ways, it's its
own first world career problem

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.310
that we feel that there's
something wrong with us

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:03.180
if we hit a plateau or a pivot
point, and very naturally

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.190
start asking, what's next?

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:06.450
What's next within my role?

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.710
Within the company?

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.280
Within my broader career,
where am I trying to go?

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.940
And we start to internalize
some of this shame

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.879
and blame that I think we
feel from the outside world.

00:01:17.879 --> 00:01:19.920
Like, you're so lucky, I
would kill for that job.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.690
And I used to get this a lot.

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.927
And I don't know if any of you
going to parties or meeting

00:01:24.927 --> 00:01:26.760
someone at a conference--
the first question

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.650
is, what's the food like?

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:29.850
Or what's the culture like?

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.860
And all of a sudden, it
seems unreasonable to talk

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.200
about what's really going
on and how you might really

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.310
be feeling.

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.430
And that it goes in
very natural ways.

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.200
What's interesting
is that I still

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.960
am experiencing this,
even 5 and 1/2 years out.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:46.650
I left Google.

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.270
I started in 2006, as the
company had 6,000 employees,

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.657
and was here as
it grew to 36,000.

00:01:52.657 --> 00:01:54.240
And when my first
book was coming out,

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.415
I left to go all in, and
give myself six months

00:01:58.415 --> 00:01:59.700
to see if I could make it.

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.990
And here I am 5 and
1/2 years later.

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.020
Not without its ups and downs.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.770
But I'll give an example of this
kind of judgment that comes.

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.050
So one of the early
reviews for the book

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.910
came in Success
Magazine, and this is

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.480
before the book was even out.

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.190
And the reporter
writes, how ironic is it

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.400
that a career development
manager at Google's much envied

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.400
Career Guru program
hit a career plateau

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.914
and needed to take a sabbatical?

00:02:26.914 --> 00:02:28.080
I'll play that back for you.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.460
She says, how ironic is it that
a career development program

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:38.040
manager at Google's much
envied Career Guru program

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.400
hit a career plateau and
needed to take a sabbatical?

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.774
At first, I thought,
ouch, that stings.

00:02:43.774 --> 00:02:46.020
And then I realized
you should want nothing

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.650
less of the teams working
here on career development,

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.780
and Career Guru, and
internal coaching

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.240
than for them to be asking
these big questions.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.690
So I don't find
it ironic at all.

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.740
I actually think
it's really important

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.010
that we think about and
consider what's next.

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.980
And Career Guru is something
that I'm very passionate about.

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.980
Becky and I worked on this
together during our time here.

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.290
And the mission was to
provide drop in coaching

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.930
for any Googler, so
that if people wanted

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.040
to talk about their career in a
safe, neutral way-- we always,

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.470
of course, are encouraging
talking to your manager,

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.436
but also to have a space
to think about what's next.

00:03:23.436 --> 00:03:24.810
And before we go
any further, let

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.643
me just say that
pivoting-- sometimes people

00:03:26.643 --> 00:03:29.100
get the wrong impression
from the book title,

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.490
that it always means drastic
career changes, changing

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:33.960
your career completely.

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:34.980
That's not it at all.

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.420
So a pivot is inherently one
related thing into the next.

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.250
And you can even pivot
within your role.

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.280
So as I wrote this book
and started researching it,

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.250
it's really a
mindset and a method

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.030
for mapping your next move.

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.130
I'll share some context
and what I discovered

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:54.870
in working on this
book, and then there

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.540
will be some time for
you to reflect today too.

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.000
Because ultimately,
pivots are very personal.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.756
And not only is there
nothing wrong with you

00:04:02.756 --> 00:04:04.380
if you've hit a pivot
point or plateau,

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:07.830
but that's as to be expected.

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.440
In fact, and especially
at a company like Google,

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.350
hitting a pivot point is
a product of your success.

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.720
It means that you've
acclimated to the role

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.089
that you're in and the
nature of the tasks

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:21.360
that are a part of your role,
and now you're very naturally

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.950
looking to say, OK, what else?

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:23.520
Give me more.

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.350
How else can I grow here?

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:28.440
When I started
unpacking this question,

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.220
first, I had two main questions.

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.240
One, how can people be
as agile as startups?

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.240
And then two, how do we get
better at asking and answering

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.800
this question, what's next?

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.290
So a little bit
about my background.

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:42.060
I was working at a
startup out of college.

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.100
In fact, I was studying
political science,

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.650
took a leave of absence to work
with a professor at a startup

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.000
as the first employee.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.730
One of my roles, maybe
5% to 10% of my role,

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:53.010
was managing our Google
adverts accounts.

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:55.290
And when I hit a
plateau there, I

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:58.950
moved over to Google on their
adverts product training team.

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:01.302
The career conversation
that I regret the most

00:05:01.302 --> 00:05:03.510
is the one I never had, and
that was with the founder

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:04.200
of the startup.

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.330
That instead of telling him,
I've hit a plateau here,

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:08.320
what else can we do?

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:09.660
How can I grow in my role?

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:11.280
I started interviewing
for Google

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.980
in my car on lunch breaks.

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:16.980
But I ended up so thankful to
get that role on the training

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:18.330
and development team.

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.490
Two years in, I hit
another pivot point.

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.500
And once again, at
that point, I really

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.180
thought something
was wrong with me.

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:25.180
I'm at Google.

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.120
I'm at the Disneyland
of companies.

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.820
What's wrong here?

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:29.820
And my role had shifted.

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:31.350
I become a manager,
I was working

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:33.930
on a lot of PowerPoint
strategy decks.

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:37.080
And I felt like there was
some element that was missing.

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.300
So thankfully, because
of a serendipitous

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.470
run in with Becky Cotton
in the parking lot,

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:45.050
she said, you know, there's this
career development team forming

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:46.050
and there's a role open.

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:47.070
You should apply for it.

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:48.600
And now I see Steve.

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.190
Hi, good to see you.

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:52.350
And so I applied
and I got the role,

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:55.560
because I'd been working
on a 10% project with Becky

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.345
to try and bring drop
in coaching to Google.

00:05:58.345 --> 00:06:00.345
And then sure enough,
about a year or two later,

00:06:00.345 --> 00:06:01.980
I hit another pivot point.

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:03.849
The book was coming
out, I was working

00:06:03.849 --> 00:06:06.390
around the clock, both at Google
and then nights and weekends

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:07.440
on my own thing.

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:08.940
And at that point,
I realized-- I

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:14.340
did take a sabbatical, my ironic
sabbatical that the reporter so

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:15.810
nicely described.

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:17.880
And I had every
intention of coming back.

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:20.250
But once I was on
the road, I realized

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:22.080
it's not going to be
fair to either Google

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:24.960
or to my own projects if I give
them both the short shrift.

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:28.740
If I spread myself too thin,
I'm just going to hit burn out

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:31.530
and not be effective
anywhere to anyone.

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:33.510
So at that point, I
made the tough decision

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:36.850
to go all in on my own thing
and see if I could do it.

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:38.724
And so I gave myself six months.

00:06:38.724 --> 00:06:40.140
And for the first
year and a half,

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:41.460
I rode the adrenaline of that.

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:43.310
Like OK, I can do this.

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:45.060
I'm not going to prove
everybody right who

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:47.010
said you're crazy to
leave, you're an idiot,

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:49.440
how are you going
to feed yourself?

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:53.100
And so I kind of poured
everything into my business

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:56.220
until once again, a year and
a half after leaving Google,

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:58.110
I was asking, what's next?

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:00.000
I had written "Life
After College."

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.590
On podcasts and
in interviews, I'd

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:03.362
become the girl who left Google.

00:07:03.362 --> 00:07:05.070
That was all anyone
wanted to talk about,

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:06.930
was what I had left behind.

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:09.840
And I was really confused
about what lies ahead.

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:11.220
What do I stand for?

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:13.380
What can I create content
and a mission around?

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:15.060
How can I be most
helpful to people?

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:16.530
Who am I?

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:18.510
And this time, I didn't
have a steady paycheck

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:20.190
to fund that exploration.

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:23.100
So as my bank account
dwindled down to zero,

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:25.500
many of my biggest fears
about leaving Google

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:28.200
were coming true.

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:30.930
I didn't know how I was going
to pay the rent in two weeks.

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:33.120
And that was really different
than every other time

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:35.862
in my career where I
had asked, what's next?

00:07:35.862 --> 00:07:37.320
At that point, the
question is not,

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:39.330
what do you do if you
knew you couldn't fail,

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:43.170
but what do you do when your
back is up against the wall?

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:45.900
And I knew I could
either solve this,

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:48.060
and I pretty much had
two weeks to do it,

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:51.900
or I would have to leave New
York or go get another job.

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:54.720
And while neither of those
things is categorically bad,

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:57.570
it just didn't feel like
the right thing for me.

00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:00.540
So in that moment, I came
to one of two conclusions.

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:02.670
Either there's something
really wrong with me,

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:05.940
and I'm destined to be
unhappy in my career,

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:08.070
and I keep asking what's
next every few years,

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:11.120
and there's a problem here,
and I will forever be unhappy--

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:12.540
and I felt ungrateful.

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:15.390
I felt ungrateful for hitting
these points within Google

00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:16.950
and now outside of it.

00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:18.900
What is it going to be?

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:22.440
I hadn't clicked into my
skis yet, if you will.

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:25.260
But the second conclusion
was that this feeling

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.870
of a midlife crisis or
a quarter life crisis

00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:31.440
was actually accelerating not
just for me, but for everybody.

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:34.860
And that instead of
getting granted permission

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:37.947
for two of these in a lifetime,
that because our economy is

00:08:37.947 --> 00:08:39.780
moving so quickly, and
particularly in tech,

00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:42.625
and Silicon Valley, and
a company like Google,

00:08:42.625 --> 00:08:44.250
we are going to be
asking and answering

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:46.020
what's next every few years.

00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:49.260
And that actually, I
would expect nothing less.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.260
So as I looked at how people
can be as agile as startups,

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:53.880
one of the things
I recognized was

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:57.090
that when we talk about startups
pivoting, it's often as plan

00:08:57.090 --> 00:09:00.150
B. The original strategy
or direction has failed,

00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:02.860
and the startup needs to
pivot to stay in business.

00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:05.490
So just like YouTube used
to be a video dating site,

00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:07.050
it pivoted to what it is today.

00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:10.990
A multibillion dollar
part of the company.

00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:12.720
But when it comes
to our careers,

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:15.960
pivot is the new
plan A. That when

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:18.930
I think about what it
takes to be successful,

00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:22.890
pivot is really a mindset that
says, again, not that you have

00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:24.600
to make drastic
career changes-- I'm

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:27.030
not here to say, oh, you
all need to leave tomorrow.

00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:28.440
That's not it at all.

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:30.450
But it's asking,
how can I pivot?

00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:31.830
How can I grow within my role?

00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:34.260
How can I double down on
what's already working

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:37.530
and shift methodically
into something new?

00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:41.160
As I started to understand, OK,
well, who is really doing this?

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:43.110
We hear about the
term "high net worth."

00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:45.870
These are people who, over
the course of their lifetimes,

00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:49.320
accrue a lot of
financial assets.

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:53.460
And so we call them high
net worth individuals.

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:55.110
Certainly, those
who work at Google,

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:57.360
at least for the
most part, and those

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:59.430
that I started
interviewing for my book--

00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:01.470
I consider them high net growth.

00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:05.550
These are people who really
value learning, growth,

00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:06.442
and exploration.

00:10:06.442 --> 00:10:09.270
And when given the choice,
they would make a lateral move

00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:10.080
within the company.

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:12.300
They would take on a
10% project in addition

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:13.740
to what they're already doing.

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:15.660
They would bootstrap a business.

00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:20.620
They would sacrifice in some
way, if needed, money in order

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:23.560
to keep pursuing their
learning and development.

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:26.320
And that when their personal
needs for growth are being met,

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:28.400
they then turn toward
making an impact.

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:30.740
So ultimately, I call
them impacters for short.

00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:34.082
High net growth
individuals thrive when

00:10:34.082 --> 00:10:35.290
they're learning and growing.

00:10:35.290 --> 00:10:36.890
That's oxygen to them.

00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:38.372
But it's not just
about me, me, me.

00:10:38.372 --> 00:10:40.330
People who are high net
growth and, ultimately,

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:42.220
high net impact
also want to know

00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:43.970
that the work they are
doing has an impact

00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:46.665
on their team, on
clients, on the company,

00:10:46.665 --> 00:10:47.706
on the broader community.

00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:52.720
Google is ground zero for this.

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:55.600
That just the definition of
"Googliness," the people who

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:59.680
Google hires-- all of you
are so smart, and hungry,

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:04.520
and committed, and adaptable,
and all of these qualities

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:06.670
that you probably
don't even realize

00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:09.140
how valuable they really are.

00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:11.810
And so this idea
of hitting a pivot

00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:13.240
point-- if you're
high net growth,

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:15.490
I would actually
expect nothing less.

00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:18.140
And that, once again,
hitting these pivot points

00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:20.930
within your role are
an opportunity to ask,

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:21.460
what's next?

00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:24.810
And how can I make
the biggest impact?

00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:27.260
I mentioned the shame and
blame that we see in our media

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.620
and in the culture,
particularly around millennials.

00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:31.330
But I actually think
that it translates

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:34.540
to those of you working at
a company like Google, which

00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:38.080
is that oh, you're
so entitled to want

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:40.690
more meaning in your work, or
to want to make a bigger impact.

00:11:40.690 --> 00:11:41.977
That there's something wrong.

00:11:41.977 --> 00:11:43.810
Well, actually, so much
is getting automated

00:11:43.810 --> 00:11:47.860
and outsourced that I think
everybody is smart to say,

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:50.020
am I using my strengths
to the fullest?

00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:52.480
Am I making the biggest
impact that I'm able?

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:56.020
And what are some small ways
that I can continue to do that

00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:58.690
and to experiment?

00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:02.180
We tend to think of growth
as a very linear process.

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:04.690
So we expect that if we
look at growth on the y-axis

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:06.941
and time on the x-axis,
we're going along,

00:12:06.941 --> 00:12:09.190
and we think it's going to
be a straight line, kind of

00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:11.140
like the old career
ladder paradigm.

00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:13.900
That you're going to get a job
at Google, or get in a new role

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:16.282
here, or even just take on a
new set of responsibilities,

00:12:16.282 --> 00:12:17.620
and it's like, OK, great.

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:18.760
Now I'm set.

00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:20.260
I can coast.

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.150
But what ends up happening
is that our growth

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:25.520
tends to naturally taper
and we hit a pivot point.

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:27.280
At that point, as we
start to look ahead,

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:29.230
we either see a
plateau, and that's

00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:32.850
just a general feeling
of I'm fine, work's fine,

00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:36.880
things are OK-- you know, it's
a little sense of stagnation--

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:38.140
or an active decline.

00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:39.640
That's where, if
you're in a role,

00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:41.980
or have a set of
responsibilities that's just

00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:44.410
really not a fit,
sometimes our bodies

00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:45.640
will start sending signals.

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:47.770
Getting sick more
often than usual.

00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:50.510
I had a friend who used
to get panic attacks when

00:12:50.510 --> 00:12:52.990
she would get off the
subway on her way to work.

00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:54.880
So that was a clear
sign her body is now

00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:58.620
starting to ring alarm bells,
like you got to make a change.

00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:01.540
So at this point, whether
we plateau or decline,

00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:02.499
the choice is to pivot.

00:13:02.499 --> 00:13:04.331
And by the way, if
you're a high net growth,

00:13:04.331 --> 00:13:06.220
if you're an
impacter, studies show

00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:08.810
that boredom has some of the
same physical manifestations

00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:10.210
in the body as stress.

00:13:10.210 --> 00:13:14.220
Increased heart rate,
increased cortisol levels.

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:16.791
And Tim Ferriss captures this
well in his book "The 4 Hour

00:13:16.791 --> 00:13:17.290
Workweek."

00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:21.730
He said the opposite of
happiness is boredom.

00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:25.130
And that pretty much captures
the impact or sentiment.

00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:27.030
So at this point the
choice is to pivot.

00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:28.570
When you think about
a pivot, pivots

00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:31.180
can be very small,
again, within your role,

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:32.530
or they can be larger.

00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:34.390
And generally, the way
to measure a pivot--

00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:36.700
and actually, I have to give
credit to Steve Maxwell,

00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:41.020
because back in the day, Steve
was the best whiteboarder

00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:41.810
I know.

00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:45.020
And we would whiteboard things
like comfort zone and stretch

00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:45.880
zone.

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:47.750
And so credit to Steve.

00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:49.860
I've kind of rethought,
on the pivot axis,

00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:51.590
what does it look
like when you're

00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:53.412
taking on new responsibilities?

00:13:53.412 --> 00:13:55.120
And so if you're in
your stagnation zone,

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:55.869
that's one thing.

00:13:55.869 --> 00:13:57.160
It's a little hard to see here.

00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:59.750
But this next level
is your comfort zone.

00:13:59.750 --> 00:14:02.415
Then the optimal range
for change for impacters

00:14:02.415 --> 00:14:04.540
is in your stretch zone,
where you feel challenged,

00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:06.654
and it's edgy and exciting.

00:14:06.654 --> 00:14:08.820
And then if you try and
turn too sharply, if you try

00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:12.400
and pivot too quickly, it might
send you into your panic zone.

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:14.560
You can consider
this at any point,

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:17.650
not just with a bigger
pivot, but with any next step

00:14:17.650 --> 00:14:19.690
or project that you're
going to take on.

00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:22.970
When I have coaching clients
come to me, and they say,

00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:27.070
I'm working at a big company
and I've hit a plateau,

00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:30.700
my number one thing is to ask,
what can you do in your role?

00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:34.180
I'm not the person that says,
oh, you should quit tomorrow.

00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:35.450
I don't believe that.

00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:38.530
I think that we're in
such a fluid economy now.

00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:41.590
And I always look
and ask for them

00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:43.600
to mine what's right in
front of them, what's

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:45.090
already under their feet.

00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:48.590
So if I had said to any of
you, oh, the right thing

00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:51.040
for you to do is to quit
tomorrow and start a business

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:52.490
from scratch, that
would probably

00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:53.680
send you into a panic zone.

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:55.600
It's probably not
the right move.

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:57.190
I mean, maybe with
rare exception,

00:14:57.190 --> 00:14:59.080
if you've already got that plan.

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:01.330
But really, the
goal of a pivot is,

00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:04.570
what next steps within
your own career development

00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:06.580
will keep you in
your stretch zone,

00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:10.136
feeling engaged, and
challenged, and excited?

00:15:10.136 --> 00:15:11.510
And so this is
something that you

00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:14.290
can gauge as you go, with
anything that you're doing,

00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:16.420
and also to look, where
am I playing it too safe?

00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:20.382
Where am I hanging out
in my comfort zone?

00:15:20.382 --> 00:15:21.840
Just so we're all
on the same page,

00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:23.340
the way that I
define a career pivot

00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:26.210
is a methodical shift in
a new related direction,

00:15:26.210 --> 00:15:28.160
based on a foundation
of your strengths

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:29.830
and what's already working.

00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:31.480
So it's not a 180.

00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:34.296
If I had left Google to
become a yoga teacher,

00:15:34.296 --> 00:15:35.420
that would have been a 180.

00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:37.340
But instead, I was doing
coaching and career development

00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:39.750
within Google, and I left
to do coaching and career

00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:41.370
development on my own.

00:15:41.370 --> 00:15:44.300
Even within Google, I was
doing adverts product training,

00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:46.040
and then I did
CTI coach training

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:48.510
on nights and weekends,
and I pivoted internally.

00:15:48.510 --> 00:15:51.380
When I did coach training, there
was no career development team.

00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:52.580
It didn't exist.

00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:55.410
But I pivoted onto it
once the team was formed.

00:15:55.410 --> 00:15:56.810
So you can see
these are examples

00:15:56.810 --> 00:16:00.100
of leveraging something
that was already working.

00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:03.200
And this is really important,
and I will say the biggest

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:07.470
mistake that I made
during my self-employment

00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:09.900
pivot was focusing
too much on what

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:12.675
I didn't want, what I didn't
know, what I didn't have.

00:16:12.675 --> 00:16:14.880
And I think that
we inadvertently

00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:15.990
do that sometimes.

00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:19.510
When we vent to friends
and family about work,

00:16:19.510 --> 00:16:21.830
it's what's bugging us.

00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:25.400
But it's rare that people
stop and say what is working.

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:26.681
What are your strengths?

00:16:26.681 --> 00:16:27.680
What are your interests?

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:28.500
What do you want?

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:30.140
What can you double down on?

00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:33.347
So if you think of a pivot,
it's like a basketball player.

00:16:33.347 --> 00:16:35.180
And this is the analogy
that came to me when

00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:37.807
I was in my really tough spot,
which is that a basketball

00:16:37.807 --> 00:16:39.390
player, when they
stop dribbling, they

00:16:39.390 --> 00:16:40.670
plant both of their feet.

00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:42.800
Then they have one
foot firmly rooted

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:45.050
and planted in the floor,
and that's their foundation,

00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:46.980
and that gives them
strength and stability.

00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:48.563
And then they can
scan for opportunity

00:16:48.563 --> 00:16:50.174
with their pivot
foot instead of what

00:16:50.174 --> 00:16:52.340
I was doing, which was
running around the basketball

00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:54.140
court like a crazy person.

00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:56.362
So the key of a pivot,
of how I define it,

00:16:56.362 --> 00:16:58.070
which is different
than what we typically

00:16:58.070 --> 00:17:00.590
hear in Silicon Valley,
is that a pivot always

00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:04.819
involves having this plant foot
by doubling down on something

00:17:04.819 --> 00:17:07.200
that's already working.

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:09.060
Before we go further,
I would love for you--

00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:10.637
and if you're
watching on video this

00:17:10.637 --> 00:17:11.970
is something you can reflect on.

00:17:11.970 --> 00:17:13.719
But if you're in the
room, turn to someone

00:17:13.719 --> 00:17:16.170
next to you and reverse
engineer a recent pivot,

00:17:16.170 --> 00:17:19.970
specifically highlighting
what the thing in common was.

00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:21.486
So to switch metaphors
for a moment,

00:17:21.486 --> 00:17:22.819
think of it like a pole vaulter.

00:17:22.819 --> 00:17:25.402
Whenever you pivot, there's this
pole, this point of leverage.

00:17:25.402 --> 00:17:26.790
Then you slam it
into the ground,

00:17:26.790 --> 00:17:29.220
and that's what catapults
you in this new direction.

00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:31.610
So think about either a pivot
that you've done internally

00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:33.930
at Google, or the pivot
that got you here,

00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:36.560
and go out and share
with each other in pairs.

00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:38.460
Because it's like
that you've already

00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:40.910
done this, even if you didn't
have the language for it.

00:17:44.410 --> 00:17:48.826
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

00:17:54.910 --> 00:17:55.960
All right.

00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:57.050
Let's come back together.

00:17:57.050 --> 00:17:58.550
I would love to
hear a few of these,

00:17:58.550 --> 00:18:01.390
because it's really fun to hear
how you've already done this.

00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:04.860
As Steve Jobs said in his
2005 commencement speech,

00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:07.180
it's much easier to connect
the dots looking backward,

00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:10.530
and reverse engineering
pivots is much the same way.

00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:12.510
Like I said, you've
already done this.

00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:14.367
And I'm actually
not here to tell you

00:18:14.367 --> 00:18:16.450
something new or something
you don't already know,

00:18:16.450 --> 00:18:20.050
I'm just giving you language
and a process to put around it.

00:18:20.050 --> 00:18:22.780
So I would love to hear either
your pivot story within Google,

00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:25.299
or what got you here, or
you can nominate a friend,

00:18:25.299 --> 00:18:27.090
if they had a particularly
interesting one.

00:18:31.791 --> 00:18:32.290
Anyone?

00:18:32.290 --> 00:18:33.280
Don't be shy.

00:18:35.910 --> 00:18:37.810
CLIFF: So I'll start
off and then see

00:18:37.810 --> 00:18:40.940
if someone else
is likewise moved.

00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:44.050
Yeah, for me, at least,
it was volunteering

00:18:44.050 --> 00:18:46.270
on the Talks at Google
program, like leading tours

00:18:46.270 --> 00:18:47.645
for the visiting
speakers, trying

00:18:47.645 --> 00:18:49.500
to find a need there
based on something

00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:50.860
that I was already doing.

00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:53.812
And then like you said,
perfecting that skill,

00:18:53.812 --> 00:18:55.770
and then expanding to
the rest of the business,

00:18:55.770 --> 00:18:59.530
and starting up
the Talks program.

00:18:59.530 --> 00:19:01.980
JENNY BLAKE: Cliff's a great
example of starting something

00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:04.180
small as an experiment,
and then later, it

00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:06.070
grows into a full time role.

00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:09.460
Which is much more common and
doable than you might think.

00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:09.960
Steve.

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:10.500
STEVE: Hello.

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:11.291
JENNY BLAKE: Hello.

00:19:11.291 --> 00:19:15.040
STEVE: So my most recent switch
was from a learning business

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:18.287
partner role into managing
the learning programs overall.

00:19:18.287 --> 00:19:19.870
And the pivot was--
I mean, it's still

00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:20.950
in learning and
development, but I

00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:22.840
realized I was actually trying
to do a whole bunch of problem

00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:24.610
solving from the learning
partner role, which

00:19:24.610 --> 00:19:26.130
was actually the job of
the person who was running

00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:26.920
the learning program.

00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:27.961
JENNY BLAKE: Interesting.

00:19:27.961 --> 00:19:30.520
STEVE: So I was already trying
to solve their problems,

00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:33.040
and then the position
opened up, and so it just

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:35.172
seemed very natural to so
sort of move into that.

00:19:35.172 --> 00:19:36.630
JENNY BLAKE: That's
so interesting.

00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:38.730
So you doubled down on
what you were already

00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:39.820
doing within the role.

00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:41.560
STEVE: Right, and what I
knew was a deeper skill

00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:43.143
set that I hadn't
been using recently,

00:19:43.143 --> 00:19:44.730
but I'd had from
20 years earlier

00:19:44.730 --> 00:19:47.610
that I developed
deeply in college.

00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:49.325
JENNY BLAKE: That's
so interesting.

00:19:49.325 --> 00:19:51.850
I heard so many people
who say once they

00:19:51.850 --> 00:19:54.439
find that next iteration of
either their existing role

00:19:54.439 --> 00:19:56.980
or their new one, they say, oh,
it feels like my whole career

00:19:56.980 --> 00:19:58.870
has been preparing me for this.

00:19:58.870 --> 00:20:01.360
And I love hearing
about latent strengths.

00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:04.870
Strengths in waiting or in
hiding that you're not fully

00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:06.855
using, but you look
back and you think, oh,

00:20:06.855 --> 00:20:08.540
duh, I've had this 20 years.

00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:10.000
That's how I felt.
I just trained

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.540
a group of pivot coaches, and it
was the first time in 5 and 1/2

00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:15.430
years I was doing
coach training again,

00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:18.730
which I used to do with Becky
here at Google for Career Guru.

00:20:18.730 --> 00:20:22.550
And it was this deep source
of joy that came back to me.

00:20:22.550 --> 00:20:25.200
It just came flooding in like,
oh, I've done this before

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:26.147
and I can do this.

00:20:26.147 --> 00:20:27.730
And so I encourage
all of you to think

00:20:27.730 --> 00:20:30.567
about strengths in waiting,
strengths in hiding,

00:20:30.567 --> 00:20:32.400
even things that you
enjoyed doing as a kid.

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:35.290
I know that's a little cliche in
the career space at this point,

00:20:35.290 --> 00:20:37.640
we hear it all the time,
but it really is true.

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:40.680
There are so many clues in
what you've already done.

00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:43.240
If I only leave you
with one thing today,

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:45.480
it's that the answer
to what's next

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:46.840
is already under your feet.

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:49.500
You're already doing it in
some way, you already know it.

00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:52.880
It's not so far
outside of yourself.

00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:55.010
So let's look at how to
actually unpack this.

00:20:55.010 --> 00:20:56.990
I developed a four
stage pivot method

00:20:56.990 --> 00:20:59.900
because, as anyone who did
work with me here knows,

00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:03.300
I really love structure, and
templates, and organization.

00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:06.140
And one of my favorite
guiding mantras in life

00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:08.360
comes from the practice
of agile development.

00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:11.840
And they have this phrase,
each time you repeat a task,

00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:14.180
take one step toward
automating it.

00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:17.812
And I felt like, well,
if every time one of us

00:21:17.812 --> 00:21:20.270
impacters or high net growth
individuals-- if every time we

00:21:20.270 --> 00:21:22.760
hit a pivot point, we
start asking what's next,

00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:24.432
and then we are driving
ourselves crazy,

00:21:24.432 --> 00:21:26.390
and taking it personally,
and beating ourselves

00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:29.480
up, and feeling ashamed that
we feel that way-- well,

00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:31.190
that's really inefficient.

00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:32.420
And that bugs me.

00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:34.730
So how can we get better
at asking and answering

00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:35.600
what's next?

00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:38.030
The pivot method is
my unpacking of that,

00:21:38.030 --> 00:21:39.890
and both reverse
engineering my moves,

00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:41.510
and interviewing
hundreds of people,

00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:44.340
and doing coaching for
the last eight years.

00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:46.160
It's a four stage
process that really

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:48.820
starts from that
basketball player analogy.

00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:51.110
So this is where we'll
get a little interactive.

00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:52.700
The first stage is plant.

00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:55.730
This is the one that
most people want to skip.

00:21:55.730 --> 00:21:58.370
Especially if you're a
problem solving go-getter,

00:21:58.370 --> 00:22:00.800
like everybody is here,
the natural reaction

00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:02.960
is, I've hit a pivot
point, what's next?

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:04.070
What's out there?

00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:05.750
The first thing most
people want to do

00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:08.090
is start looking
outside of themselves.

00:22:08.090 --> 00:22:10.850
And what ends up happening is
you're scanning without a plan.

00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:12.290
You're looking
for the next thing

00:22:12.290 --> 00:22:13.850
without being
grounded, without being

00:22:13.850 --> 00:22:15.410
rooted in this plant foot.

00:22:15.410 --> 00:22:19.310
So it ends up taking longer,
it feels more stressful,

00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:22.010
you might feel overwhelmed
by choices, feel compare

00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:24.232
and despair, or
analysis paralysis.

00:22:24.232 --> 00:22:25.940
These are the kinds
of things that happen

00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:27.680
when we skip the plant stage.

00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:31.410
So number one is,
what's already working?

00:22:31.410 --> 00:22:33.890
If you look at this graph,
it's what are your values?

00:22:33.890 --> 00:22:35.220
What's most important to you?

00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:36.380
What are your strengths?

00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:38.590
I love how Steve's example
is about what are you

00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:40.340
doing within your role
that might not even

00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:42.260
be in the job description,
but that people

00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:46.220
keep coming to you for, or that
you keep working your way to?

00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:47.600
When does time fly?

00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:49.700
When are you the
most in the zone?

00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:54.050
What is working within your
role, whether that's 95% or 5%?

00:22:54.050 --> 00:22:55.942
Identify it.

00:22:55.942 --> 00:22:57.650
And this can also be
outside of work too.

00:22:57.650 --> 00:22:59.360
What do you enjoy
doing on the side?

00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:00.590
What do you do for fun?

00:23:00.590 --> 00:23:02.715
My friend, Neil, wrote a
book called "The Happiness

00:23:02.715 --> 00:23:05.472
Equation," and he says, what's
your Saturday morning test?

00:23:05.472 --> 00:23:06.930
What do you do on
Saturday mornings

00:23:06.930 --> 00:23:10.010
when you don't feel like you
need to be doing anything else?

00:23:10.010 --> 00:23:13.490
And the second most critical
part about planting is vision.

00:23:13.490 --> 00:23:15.320
I don't believe in
asking, where do

00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:16.640
you see yourself in five years?

00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:20.210
I think that question is totally
irrelevant at this point.

00:23:20.210 --> 00:23:23.314
Who of us could have said where
we would be five years ago?

00:23:23.314 --> 00:23:25.730
Things are moving much too
quickly for that, and certainly

00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:26.270
at Google.

00:23:26.270 --> 00:23:28.400
I know when I was
here, we were reorging

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:29.810
as much as we were orging.

00:23:29.810 --> 00:23:31.670
So there's nobody
better at dealing

00:23:31.670 --> 00:23:34.510
with chaos and
uncertainty than you,

00:23:34.510 --> 00:23:36.500
and sitting at the edge of that.

00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:39.230
But I do think we can
say a one year vision.

00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:42.570
So one year from now, what
does success look like?

00:23:42.570 --> 00:23:45.950
What would you be thrilled to
have happening in your role?

00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:48.290
What does your ideal
average day look like?

00:23:48.290 --> 00:23:50.900
What kind of impact do you
want to have on your team,

00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:52.670
on your clients
within the company,

00:23:52.670 --> 00:23:55.880
on the company as a whole,
on the broader community?

00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:58.740
These are all
questions that help,

00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:00.680
I call it in the
book, put a pin in it.

00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:02.760
So just like in Google Maps,
you know where you're starting,

00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:04.343
and now you've got
to put a pin in it.

00:24:04.343 --> 00:24:06.860
And the reason a lot of
people skip this is, one,

00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:08.140
it seems kind of fuzzy.

00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:12.050
And for some, it might
be a little too soft.

00:24:12.050 --> 00:24:14.520
But it's really important.

00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:18.650
The other reason people skip it
is often our gremlins rush in.

00:24:18.650 --> 00:24:21.710
So as soon as we say something
truly exciting, what I really

00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:24.560
want to be doing a year
from now, it might say,

00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:26.780
you're not good enough,
smart enough, capable enough.

00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:27.800
That's not possible.

00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:30.590
It's harder to move internally
than it is to get a job.

00:24:30.590 --> 00:24:34.880
Like all the can'ts, or the
shoulds, or even the how.

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:36.371
How are you going to do that?

00:24:36.371 --> 00:24:38.870
I don't know if any of you have
had this experience that you

00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:41.329
tell a friend or family member
of something really exciting

00:24:41.329 --> 00:24:43.036
that you want to do,
and they immediately

00:24:43.036 --> 00:24:44.442
start peppering you with hows.

00:24:44.442 --> 00:24:45.650
How are you going to do that?

00:24:45.650 --> 00:24:46.850
How are you going to find that?

00:24:46.850 --> 00:24:47.990
How are you going to
have time for that?

00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:49.740
And so it kind of
starts to shoot it down

00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:52.089
before the vision
is even developed.

00:24:52.089 --> 00:24:54.380
When we're doing coach
training, I often describe this.

00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:57.290
The vision, it starts as a
black and white photograph,

00:24:57.290 --> 00:25:01.280
and the work here is in
blowing it up to a 3D movie.

00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:04.970
The more vivid that movie,
that vision, the more clearly,

00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:07.010
the more effectively,
and the more efficiently

00:25:07.010 --> 00:25:11.660
you can scan for
opportunities for what's next.

00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:14.180
So now just take a moment.

00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:17.360
And in fact, we'll just
give, let's say, 30 seconds,

00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:19.220
even with your eyes closed.

00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:22.250
And think about what you're
currently enjoying most

00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:23.360
and what's working best.

00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:28.803
Because I know not everyone
has a pen and paper,

00:25:28.803 --> 00:25:29.886
which is a real throwback.

00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:41.120
And now start to reflect
on what does success

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:42.720
look like a year from now?

00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:46.980
So a year from now, how
do you want to feel?

00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:49.670
And again, I encourage
you to close your eyes.

00:25:49.670 --> 00:25:52.400
If you're watching on video, you
can definitely jot things down

00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:55.190
on paper and pause.

00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:57.856
What does smashing success
looks like a year from now?

00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:03.231
I encourage you to spend
much more time on this.

00:26:03.231 --> 00:26:04.730
When I'm work with
coaching clients,

00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:08.130
sometimes I spend a month or
more on each of these stages.

00:26:08.130 --> 00:26:10.340
We're doing 30
seconds, which is just

00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:12.470
the tiniest tip of the iceberg.

00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:15.675
But you start to get a sense
for how to work yourself

00:26:15.675 --> 00:26:16.550
through this process.

00:26:16.550 --> 00:26:19.670
And I also encourage you,
if you do this later,

00:26:19.670 --> 00:26:21.410
don't stop brainstorming.

00:26:21.410 --> 00:26:22.070
Keep going.

00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:23.720
Go for your stretch zone.

00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:26.000
It's often the case that
when I say, what does success

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.680
look like a year
from now, people

00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:29.660
give me something pretty safe.

00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:31.190
What feels reasonable.

00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:34.700
And I encourage you not to do
that at these early stages.

00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:36.440
Instead, go for quantity.

00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:38.300
Write down as much as you can.

00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:42.170
And then later, you'll get
a chance to narrow it down.

00:26:42.170 --> 00:26:44.081
The next stage is that
once you're rooted,

00:26:44.081 --> 00:26:46.580
so once you know where you are
and where you want to end up,

00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:48.690
these form the
brackets of your pivot.

00:26:48.690 --> 00:26:50.960
And now we have a
much clearer picture

00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:53.030
of this gap between
where you are now,

00:26:53.030 --> 00:26:55.280
where you want to end up,
and how to bridge the two.

00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:58.790
And the way to bridge this
gap is through people, skills,

00:26:58.790 --> 00:27:01.522
and projects.

00:27:01.522 --> 00:27:02.730
So we're rooted in our plant.

00:27:02.730 --> 00:27:05.450
So based on your strengths
and your one year vision,

00:27:05.450 --> 00:27:07.850
now we can look for people,
skills, and projects

00:27:07.850 --> 00:27:09.670
that are connected to that.

00:27:09.670 --> 00:27:11.930
So the scanning is anchored.

00:27:11.930 --> 00:27:12.890
So the people.

00:27:12.890 --> 00:27:13.799
Who do you admire?

00:27:13.799 --> 00:27:14.840
Who can you connect with?

00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:16.464
Who is doing what
you want to be doing?

00:27:16.464 --> 00:27:18.530
I like, again, to
use Steve's example.

00:27:18.530 --> 00:27:21.170
Someone had this role that
he was really interested in,

00:27:21.170 --> 00:27:22.790
and when the role
opened up, he knew

00:27:22.790 --> 00:27:26.000
he was perfectly
positioned to move into it.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.340
And this can be within the
company or outside of it.

00:27:28.340 --> 00:27:30.800
These mentors can be friendtors.

00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:33.410
Friends of yours who you can
brainstorm, and collaborate,

00:27:33.410 --> 00:27:34.370
and connect with.

00:27:34.370 --> 00:27:36.590
They can also be
mentors from afar.

00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:39.230
It's perfectly fine if you
want to say Larry Page,

00:27:39.230 --> 00:27:41.240
and you look to him to
see, what is he doing?

00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:43.550
How does he manage
his next move?

00:27:43.550 --> 00:27:45.530
Or even podcasts, books.

00:27:45.530 --> 00:27:48.080
There are so many ways that
you can learn from people

00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:49.640
that it doesn't all
have to be people

00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:52.010
with in your direct access.

00:27:52.010 --> 00:27:52.700
Skills.

00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:54.430
Usually when we're here
and we want to get here,

00:27:54.430 --> 00:27:55.305
there is a skill gap.

00:27:55.305 --> 00:27:56.150
And that's exciting.

00:27:56.150 --> 00:28:00.260
That's the whole point of
wanting to plan our next move.

00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:01.770
How can I learn and grow?

00:28:01.770 --> 00:28:04.302
That feeds our
soul as impacters.

00:28:04.302 --> 00:28:05.510
So what do you want to learn?

00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:07.176
What do you want to
become an expert in?

00:28:07.176 --> 00:28:10.070
Get strategic about what skills,
if you were to develop them

00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:12.830
further, would most help you
move from where you are now

00:28:12.830 --> 00:28:14.090
to where you want to go.

00:28:14.090 --> 00:28:16.340
I mentioned, while we
were fixing the slides,

00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:18.560
that when I applied
to the job at Google,

00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:21.920
I was absolutely terrified
to speak in front of people.

00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:25.245
And I mentioned I got red hives
all over my chest and neck.

00:28:25.245 --> 00:28:26.870
So I applied for the
training team role

00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:28.760
because I knew
that that skill set

00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:30.950
of being in front of the
room, and somehow trying

00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:33.560
to remain calm, and
not embarrass myself

00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:36.200
with my physiological
response, would be a good asset

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:37.520
to have some day.

00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:40.160
And that's what's allowing
me to be here now, and not

00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:43.050
be freaking out, and not
be wearing a turtleneck.

00:28:43.050 --> 00:28:44.600
So skills is important.

00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:45.350
And then projects.

00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:46.724
Then you can start
to narrow down

00:28:46.724 --> 00:28:48.671
projects that are going
to be, again, based

00:28:48.671 --> 00:28:50.420
on what you identified
in the plant stage,

00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:52.310
exciting to move into.

00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:54.800
So I know we're doing this
all in our head at the moment,

00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:58.120
but close your eyes for another
30-- we'll do a minute total,

00:28:58.120 --> 00:29:01.070
but 30 seconds on,
who do you admire?

00:29:01.070 --> 00:29:02.600
So based on your
one year vision,

00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:05.750
who's currently doing
things that are interesting

00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:07.970
to you, either within the
company or outside of it?

00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:12.380
And who might you talk to?

00:29:12.380 --> 00:29:13.934
Who could you
schedule lunch with?

00:29:18.970 --> 00:29:21.600
OK.

00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:25.080
So scanning is about
seeing what's out there.

00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:26.990
And then the third stage, pilot.

00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:29.410
So this will be near and dear
to your heart as Googlers.

00:29:29.410 --> 00:29:31.331
Certainly, I share
so many stories

00:29:31.331 --> 00:29:32.330
of Googlers in the book.

00:29:32.330 --> 00:29:34.460
And so much of my
philosophy around

00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:36.680
applying pivoting
to career comes

00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:38.474
from what I learned
at Google, and what

00:29:38.474 --> 00:29:40.640
I learned both doing training,
and then later moving

00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:42.210
into coaching
career development.

00:29:42.210 --> 00:29:42.710
Pilot.

00:29:42.710 --> 00:29:44.870
We talk about pilots
all the time at Google.

00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:47.120
Pilot programs, pilot launches.

00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:50.480
So it's a way to test an
idea and see how it goes.

00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:52.400
I mentioned in the
book there's a chapter,

00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:54.050
it's called "Get Scrappy."

00:29:54.050 --> 00:29:55.760
So we know, and I
directly say this

00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:58.070
is something I learned at
Google, launch and iterate.

00:29:58.070 --> 00:30:00.590
And what's different is
applying that to career.

00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:02.902
Because a lot of people
put pressure on themselves,

00:30:02.902 --> 00:30:04.610
when they think about
career development,

00:30:04.610 --> 00:30:06.890
to have the next huge move.

00:30:06.890 --> 00:30:08.270
And there's so much pressure.

00:30:08.270 --> 00:30:10.644
And when we're thinking on
the old paradigm of the career

00:30:10.644 --> 00:30:12.200
ladder, there's
a lot of pressure

00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:15.110
to try and magically jump
from one rung all the way up

00:30:15.110 --> 00:30:16.320
to the next.

00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:19.220
But instead, if you can think
about career pilots, smaller

00:30:19.220 --> 00:30:22.520
experiments, think about
your own personal 10% or 20%

00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:26.420
projects in your career, then
you could be much more agile.

00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:29.690
So I mentioned that I like to
use the analogy of your career

00:30:29.690 --> 00:30:30.819
as a smartphone.

00:30:30.819 --> 00:30:32.360
So your education
and your upbringing

00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:33.860
is you're out of the box model.

00:30:33.860 --> 00:30:36.630
Then it's up to you to download
apps for different skills,

00:30:36.630 --> 00:30:39.170
interests, and experiences
that are exciting to you,

00:30:39.170 --> 00:30:41.830
just like what we've done in
the plant and scan stages.

00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:44.330
Well, piloting is all
about downloading an app.

00:30:44.330 --> 00:30:46.100
Becky and I downloaded
an app, which

00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:48.320
was a 10% project
of trying to build

00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:50.900
this drop in coaching program
with a whole team of people

00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:51.980
early on.

00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:56.000
Cliff had an app of volunteering
to manage talks when it was not

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:57.170
at all your full time role.

00:30:57.170 --> 00:31:00.230
It was just a small
passion project.

00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:03.380
And even doing campus tours
is a really interesting career

00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:04.214
pilot.

00:31:04.214 --> 00:31:05.630
So I encourage you
to think about,

00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:08.890
how can you now
test what hypotheses

00:31:08.890 --> 00:31:11.440
you've come up with in
the plant and scan stages

00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:12.820
based on your strengths?

00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:15.770
So it all should build from what
you've looked at previously.

00:31:15.770 --> 00:31:17.710
And a good pilot, a
good career pilot,

00:31:17.710 --> 00:31:19.940
will test what I
call the three E's.

00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:23.290
One, do I enjoy this new area?

00:31:23.290 --> 00:31:26.230
Two, can I become an expert
at it, and do I want to?

00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:28.450
And three, is there
room to expand?

00:31:28.450 --> 00:31:31.630
So for example, when I
went to coach training,

00:31:31.630 --> 00:31:32.680
I knew I enjoyed it.

00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:35.062
I couldn't believe that my
bookshelves had come to life

00:31:35.062 --> 00:31:36.520
and there was a
room full of people

00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:39.400
that were interested
in talking about things

00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:42.370
like human potential
and fulfillment in life.

00:31:42.370 --> 00:31:43.150
OK.

00:31:43.150 --> 00:31:43.704
Expertise.

00:31:43.704 --> 00:31:44.745
Could I become an expert?

00:31:44.745 --> 00:31:45.940
Who knows?

00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:48.040
But I was willing to
try, and invest in that,

00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:49.785
and feel really
awkward and nervous.

00:31:49.785 --> 00:31:52.160
I used to be sick to my stomach
before coaching sessions,

00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:53.710
because I was just nervous.

00:31:53.710 --> 00:31:55.660
But I kept pushing through that.

00:31:55.660 --> 00:31:56.772
And then expansion.

00:31:56.772 --> 00:31:58.480
At that time, there
was not a role for me

00:31:58.480 --> 00:31:59.950
to be a coach
within the company.

00:31:59.950 --> 00:32:04.120
But by continuing,
it built naturally.

00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:06.140
I share Seth Marbin's
story in the book.

00:32:06.140 --> 00:32:09.220
Seth started GoogleServe as a
response to a Google culture

00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:11.410
idea call out one year.

00:32:11.410 --> 00:32:14.650
And the first year, he had
7,000 people from 40 countries,

00:32:14.650 --> 00:32:16.204
and it was over one day.

00:32:16.204 --> 00:32:17.620
The following year,
he doubled it.

00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:20.860
He had 14,000 volunteers
from 70 countries,

00:32:20.860 --> 00:32:22.570
and it was a full week.

00:32:22.570 --> 00:32:25.710
And then over the years, again,
there was no role at the time,

00:32:25.710 --> 00:32:28.990
but he ended up pitching a role
managing Google's volunteer

00:32:28.990 --> 00:32:30.510
outreach full time.

00:32:30.510 --> 00:32:34.050
So that's a great example of
you know you're enjoying it,

00:32:34.050 --> 00:32:36.900
he's becoming better at it,
he's proving the market.

00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:39.251
So even within the
company, proving the market

00:32:39.251 --> 00:32:40.750
need, and that,
hey, this can really

00:32:40.750 --> 00:32:42.650
make an impact on the business.

00:32:42.650 --> 00:32:45.780
And then it grew
naturally from there.

00:32:45.780 --> 00:32:48.780
So now take 30 seconds,
and think about,

00:32:48.780 --> 00:32:51.510
what experiments could
you run in the next month?

00:32:51.510 --> 00:32:54.160
So based on the
skills, and the people,

00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:56.710
and the strengths that
you've already identified,

00:32:56.710 --> 00:33:01.010
think about-- this is kind of
comfort zone to stretch zone.

00:33:01.010 --> 00:33:01.950
OK?

00:33:01.950 --> 00:33:03.400
And a career pilot
could even just

00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:04.910
be having lunch with someone.

00:33:04.910 --> 00:33:08.260
So they don't all have
to be massive projects.

00:33:08.260 --> 00:33:08.760
OK.

00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:10.690
Close your eyes,
take 20 more seconds

00:33:10.690 --> 00:33:11.860
to brainstorm on this one.

00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:17.270
Small experiments.

00:33:17.270 --> 00:33:20.150
Go for quantity, not
quality at this point.

00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:31.340
Now think about in
the next six months.

00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:33.620
What would fall in
your stretch zone?

00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:36.150
Reconnect with your
one your vision.

00:33:36.150 --> 00:33:40.400
What pilots would most move
you toward that one year vision

00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:42.650
that you identified that you
could run in the next six

00:33:42.650 --> 00:33:44.020
months?

00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:45.710
OK, time.

00:33:45.710 --> 00:33:49.408
Again, you could spend a
whole lot longer on these.

00:33:49.408 --> 00:33:51.470
This is really
fun to brainstorm.

00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:54.694
So I encourage you to, again,
go for quantity over quality.

00:33:54.694 --> 00:33:56.360
Think about things
in your stretch zone.

00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:58.130
Think of what would move
you closest to your one year

00:33:58.130 --> 00:33:58.970
vision.

00:33:58.970 --> 00:34:00.590
And know that pivot is a cycle.

00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:03.110
So you can plant, scan,
pilot over and over,

00:34:03.110 --> 00:34:04.400
and be perfectly happy.

00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:06.620
In fact, you could
do this for years.

00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:09.340
And this is a way to
frame career development,

00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:11.763
that there doesn't
necessarily have

00:34:11.763 --> 00:34:13.429
to be this fourth
stage, which we'll get

00:34:13.429 --> 00:34:14.870
to in a minute, of launching.

00:34:14.870 --> 00:34:17.469
But you can continuously be
plant, scanning, and piloting.

00:34:17.469 --> 00:34:20.570
You could continuously say,
every quarter, what's working?

00:34:20.570 --> 00:34:21.730
What can I double down on?

00:34:21.730 --> 00:34:22.310
What's out there?

00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:23.330
What do I want to learn?

00:34:23.330 --> 00:34:23.840
Great.

00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:25.080
What pilots can I run?

00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:27.440
And I love metaphors,
so if you think

00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:30.274
about pilots like race
horses at the Kentucky Derby,

00:34:30.274 --> 00:34:32.190
they're like race horses
at the starting gate.

00:34:32.190 --> 00:34:34.330
And eventually, one of
them will pull ahead,

00:34:34.330 --> 00:34:35.540
but we don't know which one.

00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:38.350
I mean, even for me. "PIVOT"
just launched last week,

00:34:38.350 --> 00:34:40.790
and I've been working on
this book for three years.

00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:42.679
It's my own pivot point.

00:34:42.679 --> 00:34:45.370
And people are inevitably
going to ask, what's next,

00:34:45.370 --> 00:34:47.420
which triggered my first
existential crisis when

00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:49.100
my first book came out.

00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:51.409
And the truth is I don't know.

00:34:51.409 --> 00:34:52.600
I really don't.

00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:56.449
I have pilots, I have
ideas, I have hypotheses,

00:34:56.449 --> 00:34:59.660
but I actually have no clue
which of my income stream

00:34:59.660 --> 00:35:01.910
race horses is
going to take off.

00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:05.770
And so part of, again, what
you're so good at already,

00:35:05.770 --> 00:35:08.834
being in the Google culture,
is being OK with that.

00:35:08.834 --> 00:35:10.250
And it's one of
the biggest things

00:35:10.250 --> 00:35:11.810
that I learned
writing this book.

00:35:11.810 --> 00:35:14.600
From the time I interviewed
people to a year and a half

00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:16.540
later when I went to
fact check, almost nobody

00:35:16.540 --> 00:35:18.920
had stayed in the same
place, both by choice

00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:20.230
and by circumstance.

00:35:20.230 --> 00:35:23.600
People got hired, fired,
their companies got acquired,

00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:25.596
then they got fired,
they quit their jobs,

00:35:25.596 --> 00:35:28.220
they started their own business,
they hated their own business,

00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:29.540
so they went back to a job.

00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:30.560
I mean, I saw it all.

00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:32.230
I saw it all.

00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:35.270
And even within Google, we know
that things change so quickly.

00:35:35.270 --> 00:35:37.520
And you think you're in one
role, or then your manager

00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:41.120
changes, or the company, the
org changes, or the building

00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:43.810
changes, or you go work
in an office abroad.

00:35:43.810 --> 00:35:45.580
So there's so much going on.

00:35:45.580 --> 00:35:48.376
And you can always
be looking at,

00:35:48.376 --> 00:35:49.750
what do I want to
double down on?

00:35:49.750 --> 00:35:52.850
What is working, and
how can I do more of it?

00:35:52.850 --> 00:35:55.000
Sometimes there is
a launch moment.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.247
So that's when you go all
in on a new direction.

00:35:57.247 --> 00:35:58.580
My editor and I were very clear.

00:35:58.580 --> 00:36:00.830
We actually took out
the word leap, which

00:36:00.830 --> 00:36:02.350
this used to be called leap.

00:36:02.350 --> 00:36:05.350
And we realized that when
you follow the pivot method,

00:36:05.350 --> 00:36:06.500
it's not a leap anymore.

00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:08.620
It's not a blind
leap, it's not a jump.

00:36:08.620 --> 00:36:11.270
That you're reducing risk by
piloting, so that by the time

00:36:11.270 --> 00:36:13.970
you do go all in on something,
you take a new role,

00:36:13.970 --> 00:36:17.460
you move to another team, you
do go work in an office abroad,

00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:18.730
you're more clear.

00:36:18.730 --> 00:36:19.564
There's less risk.

00:36:19.564 --> 00:36:21.230
It hasn't sent you
into your panic zone.

00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:23.620
You have very methodically
worked your way

00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:26.144
into that launch, where
it becomes really clear.

00:36:26.144 --> 00:36:27.560
And of course,
there will still be

00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:30.160
some uncertainty and
some fear, but nobody

00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:32.750
that I talked to regretted
their launch decision,

00:36:32.750 --> 00:36:34.580
no matter what their
move was, which

00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:36.080
I found really interesting.

00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:38.870
So I say in the book that
if you're an impacter,

00:36:38.870 --> 00:36:40.940
we don't have
FOMO, we have FONT.

00:36:40.940 --> 00:36:42.410
Fear of not trying.

00:36:42.410 --> 00:36:44.270
That ultimately,
our biggest fear

00:36:44.270 --> 00:36:47.290
is to have an idea
about ways to better

00:36:47.290 --> 00:36:49.390
leverage our strengths
to make a bigger impact--

00:36:49.390 --> 00:36:51.670
our biggest fear is not to try.

00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:54.160
So ultimately, when you're
ready to launch, a lot of people

00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:56.243
ask, well, how do I know
when I'm ready to launch?

00:36:56.243 --> 00:36:58.645
It's when you know that you
would rather try and fail--

00:36:58.645 --> 00:37:02.530
which what does that
even mean-- than not try

00:37:02.530 --> 00:37:05.620
and stay in the same place.

00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:08.170
So we didn't use paper, so
there's nothing to circle.

00:37:08.170 --> 00:37:10.565
But I would love for you
to now turn in pairs.

00:37:10.565 --> 00:37:12.190
These are two of my
favorite questions.

00:37:12.190 --> 00:37:14.822
You can ask them of
yourself on any project.

00:37:14.822 --> 00:37:16.780
You could even use the
pivot method on projects

00:37:16.780 --> 00:37:17.810
that you're stuck on.

00:37:17.810 --> 00:37:20.080
But consider, and turn
to someone next to you,

00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:23.320
and just share one small step
you can take in the next week,

00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:26.050
based on everything that
you were reflecting on.

00:37:26.050 --> 00:37:28.930
And what next step would
make the biggest impact?

00:37:28.930 --> 00:37:31.330
And these can be
professional or personal.

00:37:31.330 --> 00:37:34.930
For some people, their skill is
like cooking or salsa dancing,

00:37:34.930 --> 00:37:37.360
and that would be an app they
want to download and feel

00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:37.860
fulfilled.

00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:40.558
So go ahead and share in pairs,
then we'll do some as a group.

00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:50.361
Great.

00:37:50.361 --> 00:37:50.860
OK.

00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:52.770
In the interest of
time, we'll keep moving,

00:37:52.770 --> 00:37:54.500
but I encourage
you to share these.

00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:55.195
Ask each other.

00:37:55.195 --> 00:37:56.880
It's also one of my
favorite questions

00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:59.940
now when I meet new people, and
even talking to other Googlers,

00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:02.910
to ask about their
pivots internally

00:38:02.910 --> 00:38:05.760
or what they're
thinking about next.

00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:07.982
This can also be used as
a conversation framework.

00:38:07.982 --> 00:38:10.440
So a lot of times when people
come to us and they're stuck,

00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:13.140
they may say, oh, I just
don't know what I should do,

00:38:13.140 --> 00:38:15.780
our first instinct is to
jump to giving advice.

00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:17.340
But actually, that
sort of robs them

00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:19.890
of facilitating their
own thought process

00:38:19.890 --> 00:38:21.580
and being the expert
in their own life.

00:38:21.580 --> 00:38:25.049
So you could even apply pivot as
a conversation framework, where

00:38:25.049 --> 00:38:26.340
you say, well, what is working?

00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:27.660
What do you want?

00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:28.530
What's out there?

00:38:28.530 --> 00:38:29.370
What can you try?

00:38:29.370 --> 00:38:31.170
What's a small next
step you can take?

00:38:31.170 --> 00:38:33.272
And you can see that's
less than a minute.

00:38:33.272 --> 00:38:35.730
So you can do this in as little
as 10 minutes with someone.

00:38:35.730 --> 00:38:37.688
And so I encourage you--
that's also a nice way

00:38:37.688 --> 00:38:40.470
to try having conversations
with other people,

00:38:40.470 --> 00:38:44.370
to frame it up in a really
strengths based approach.

00:38:44.370 --> 00:38:46.770
One of my favorite quotes
is from poet David White,

00:38:46.770 --> 00:38:49.530
who says, that which you can
plan is too small for you

00:38:49.530 --> 00:38:50.850
to live.

00:38:50.850 --> 00:38:53.760
One of the things that I
feel most passionate about

00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:59.490
is just to release you all of
the pressure to have to know,

00:38:59.490 --> 00:39:02.400
in perfect specificity,
what's next.

00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:04.320
And that, actually,
you don't need to.

00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:07.200
And if you did,
you would be bored.

00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:09.690
And that even Eric Schmidt
and Jonathan Rosenberg,

00:39:09.690 --> 00:39:11.200
in their book "How
Google Works"--

00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:14.539
they talk about smart creatives,
and that we do all this work

00:39:14.539 --> 00:39:16.080
to bring in smart
creatives, and then

00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:18.370
they inevitably want to
change, and shift, and grow.

00:39:18.370 --> 00:39:21.840
They say still fight
like hell to keep them.

00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:23.030
And I love that perspective.

00:39:23.030 --> 00:39:24.780
That it's like, why
did we expect anything

00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:28.674
less of anyone in this
room than to feel this way?

00:39:28.674 --> 00:39:31.090
That that which you can plan
is too small for you to live.

00:39:31.090 --> 00:39:35.160
So as uncomfortable as the
uncertainty can be sometimes,

00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:39.540
I wish I could convey that it is
such a ninja skill that you're

00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:40.350
all developing.

00:39:40.350 --> 00:39:41.850
That as I did the
research, and what

00:39:41.850 --> 00:39:45.090
does it really take to be most
agile in a modern economy, one

00:39:45.090 --> 00:39:48.690
of the things is the ability
to handle uncertainty.

00:39:48.690 --> 00:39:50.750
If you work at Google, check.

00:39:50.750 --> 00:39:52.710
Another is openness
and willingness

00:39:52.710 --> 00:39:54.120
to try new technology.

00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:55.444
Once again, check.

00:39:55.444 --> 00:39:57.360
The third, we're moving
from knowledge workers

00:39:57.360 --> 00:39:58.830
to relationship workers.

00:39:58.830 --> 00:40:02.850
That actually, we're at
peak data, peak information,

00:40:02.850 --> 00:40:04.590
peak content online.

00:40:04.590 --> 00:40:07.260
And that with
automation, and robots,

00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:09.180
and outsourcing,
that the real value

00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:12.420
is in becoming relationship
workers, collaborating.

00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:13.950
Once again, check.

00:40:13.950 --> 00:40:16.480
You have everything
that you need.

00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:20.460
And if you've hit a pivot point
in your role at the company,

00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:21.300
you're human.

00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:23.050
You're human, this
is to be expected,

00:40:23.050 --> 00:40:24.649
and that should be celebrated.

00:40:24.649 --> 00:40:26.190
And again, it doesn't
mean that these

00:40:26.190 --> 00:40:28.080
have to be big drastic changes.

00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:29.760
But something I'm
so passionate about

00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:32.130
is just giving us
new language that's

00:40:32.130 --> 00:40:34.140
gender neutral and
judgment neutral.

00:40:34.140 --> 00:40:35.220
So pivot.

00:40:35.220 --> 00:40:37.380
It doesn't have to be a crisis.

00:40:37.380 --> 00:40:40.250
One of my personal mottos that
I've adopted is build first,

00:40:40.250 --> 00:40:41.500
then your courage will follow.

00:40:41.500 --> 00:40:46.682
I came to realize that courage
doesn't drop down from the sky.

00:40:46.682 --> 00:40:48.890
When we want to make a move,
sometimes we're waiting.

00:40:48.890 --> 00:40:50.580
Oh, when I feel
courageous enough,

00:40:50.580 --> 00:40:52.860
I'll do this next thing,
I'll approach my manager

00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:54.900
about this idea that I have.

00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:56.880
But actually, it works
the opposite way.

00:40:56.880 --> 00:40:59.970
That when we just start
taking small steps,

00:40:59.970 --> 00:41:04.530
and planting seeds, and running
pilots pretty much on faith,

00:41:04.530 --> 00:41:05.940
not knowing what's
going to work,

00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:08.540
but trusting that if we keep
trying these small experiments,

00:41:08.540 --> 00:41:11.432
something will click,
that's when we really

00:41:11.432 --> 00:41:12.390
start to feel progress.

00:41:12.390 --> 00:41:15.420
And in taking those steps, we
start to feel more courageous.

00:41:15.420 --> 00:41:21.180
And that actually, fear,
insecurity, and uncertainty

00:41:21.180 --> 00:41:24.720
are the biggest doorways of
opportunity that we have.

00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:28.806
So when you feel those things,
when you're asking what's next,

00:41:28.806 --> 00:41:30.180
you can stop taking
it personally

00:41:30.180 --> 00:41:33.600
and know that you're
absolutely on the right track,

00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:35.400
and that in asking
those questions,

00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:36.800
the answers will come.

00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:40.010
And that you don't have to have
every next step mapped our.

00:41:40.010 --> 00:41:43.460
The only move that
matters is your next one.

00:41:43.460 --> 00:41:44.180
Thank you.

00:41:44.180 --> 00:41:45.630
Thank you so much for having me.

00:41:45.630 --> 00:41:46.560
SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:48.300
JENNY BLAKE: And if you want to
learn more, there's the book,

00:41:48.300 --> 00:41:50.008
and I have a "PIVOT"
podcast, and there's

00:41:50.008 --> 00:41:51.960
a full toolkit online.

00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:55.720
I have about 40 templates
for things like ideal day,

00:41:55.720 --> 00:41:58.500
knowns and unknowns,
pilot brainstorming.
