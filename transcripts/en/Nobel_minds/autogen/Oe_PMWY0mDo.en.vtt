hi I'm Matthew Langford I'm 14 years old

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639
hi I'm Matthew Langford I'm 14 years old
 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:04.610
hi I'm Matthew Langford I'm 14 years old
and I study physics at Southern Grammar

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620
and I study physics at Southern Grammar
 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.340
and I study physics at Southern Grammar
School do you believe that there are the

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350
School do you believe that there are the
 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:08.629
School do you believe that there are the
planets in the universe which are

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639
planets in the universe which are
 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.990
planets in the universe which are
capable of supporting life so Matthew

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000
capable of supporting life so Matthew
 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.150
capable of supporting life so Matthew
wants to know do I believe that there

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160
wants to know do I believe that there
 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.379
wants to know do I believe that there
are other planets in the world capable

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389
are other planets in the world capable
 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.920
are other planets in the world capable
of supporting life I imagine so there

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930
of supporting life I imagine so there
 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.750
of supporting life I imagine so there
are about a 100 billion stars in our own

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760
are about a 100 billion stars in our own
 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.189
are about a 100 billion stars in our own
galaxy and there are about a hundred

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199
galaxy and there are about a hundred
 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.109
galaxy and there are about a hundred
billion galaxies that we could see and

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119
billion galaxies that we could see and
 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.630
billion galaxies that we could see and
it seems that about 10% of the stars

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640
it seems that about 10% of the stars
 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.419
it seems that about 10% of the stars
that have that look like the Sun do have

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429
that have that look like the Sun do have
 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.730
that have that look like the Sun do have
planets so it seems pretty likely that

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740
planets so it seems pretty likely that
 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.260
planets so it seems pretty likely that
there are planets out there that could

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270
there are planets out there that could
 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.139
there are planets out there that could
support life now is there life we don't

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149
support life now is there life we don't
 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.150
support life now is there life we don't
know yet but we could in the future

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160
know yet but we could in the future
 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.280
know yet but we could in the future
because there are ways to find out the

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290
because there are ways to find out the
 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.920
because there are ways to find out the
signs of life if we would find oxygen in

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930
signs of life if we would find oxygen in
 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.119
signs of life if we would find oxygen in
the atmosphere of a planet around

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129
the atmosphere of a planet around
 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.250
the atmosphere of a planet around
another star we would say it must be

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260
another star we would say it must be
 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.979
another star we would say it must be
alive because oxygen is so reactive that

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989
alive because oxygen is so reactive that
 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.020
alive because oxygen is so reactive that
it cannot exist according to our

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030
it cannot exist according to our
 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.299
it cannot exist according to our
thoughts in the atmosphere of a planet

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309
thoughts in the atmosphere of a planet
 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.189
thoughts in the atmosphere of a planet
unless something is producing that

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199
unless something is producing that
 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.520
unless something is producing that
oxygen currently so yes we're looking

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530
oxygen currently so yes we're looking
 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.349
oxygen currently so yes we're looking
for oxygen in the in planetary

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359
for oxygen in the in planetary
 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.970
for oxygen in the in planetary
atmospheres around other stars and when

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980
atmospheres around other stars and when
 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.979
atmospheres around other stars and when
we find it we would say aha those

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989
we find it we would say aha those
 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.830
we find it we would say aha those
planets are alive
