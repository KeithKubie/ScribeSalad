00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.456
If you've ever been in that situation, psychologists would suggest that you not

00:00:04.456 --> 00:00:09.593
helping the person was due to what we term diffusion of responsibility. And

00:00:09.593 --> 00:00:14.350
this just states that when many people are present, we are less likely to help.

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:17.914
Now, I mentioned earlier that, in addition to this research, many researchers

00:00:17.914 --> 00:00:22.714
have looked at bystander effect. And they have found that there are some

00:00:22.714 --> 00:00:26.146
variables that actually influence whether we are more likely or less likely to

00:00:26.146 --> 00:00:31.005
help, besides just the number of people present. Some of the variables and

00:00:31.005 --> 00:00:34.415
situations they looked at in regards to bystander effect and diffusion of

00:00:34.415 --> 00:00:39.695
responsibility. Have been emergencies versus non-emergencies. They've looked at

00:00:39.695 --> 00:00:46.042
the ambiguity and consequences of the situation. They've looked at priming by

00:00:46.042 --> 00:00:51.340
the bystander. So for example, the bystander may attempt to get eye contact

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:57.030
with a participant. They've also looked at cohesiveness and group membership.

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.464
And finally they looked at personality and background. There are lots of

00:01:01.464 --> 00:01:04.575
studies on the bystander effect, but now let's go back to Lauren and talk a

00:01:04.575 --> 00:01:09.431
little bit more about how we assess whether or not we should get involved.
