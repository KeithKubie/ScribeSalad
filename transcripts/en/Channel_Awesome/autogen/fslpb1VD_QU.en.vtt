maybe they're playing up the the

00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:48.420
maybe they're playing up the the
 

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:50.569

that's what they're playing up because
 

00:09:58.139 --> 00:09:59.720
that's what they're playing up because
so much is opening up and then it's such

00:09:59.720 --> 00:09:59.730
so much is opening up and then it's such
 

00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:01.189
so much is opening up and then it's such
a rush and then finally when the rest

00:10:01.189 --> 00:10:01.199
a rush and then finally when the rest
 

00:10:01.199 --> 00:10:03.500
a rush and then finally when the rest
happens it's you feel genuinely
