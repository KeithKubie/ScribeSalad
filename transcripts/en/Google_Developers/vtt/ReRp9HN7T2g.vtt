LANE SHACKLETON: Thank you so
much for coming to the last

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.470
session of Google I/O. We
understand that we're the only

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:08.610
thing standing between
you and happy hour.

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.620
So we're going to try to
keep this interesting.

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:11.580
My name is Lane.

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.780
I'm a product manager on
monetization at YouTube and

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:15.620
this is A.J.

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:17.045
A.J. CRANE: Hey,
I'm A.J. Crane.

00:00:17.045 --> 00:00:20.656
I'm the product manager
for YouTube Channels.

00:00:20.656 --> 00:00:21.640
LANE SHACKLETON: Cool.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.230
So for the next 40 minutes, this
is what we're going to

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:25.460
talk about.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.930
First we're going to talk
about some interesting

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.670
statistics and why your business
should be on YouTube.

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:35.980
Secondly, we're going to talk
about three examples of

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.560
businesses that are creating
great content that feels a lot

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.700
like the rest of the content
on YouTube and not like

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.800
traditional commercials.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.860
And then we're going to bring
up a special guest from the

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.680
audience to demo how you can get
set up with your presence

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.770
on YouTube once you have
that great content.

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.990
And then, finally, we'll
answer some questions.

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:58.290
OK.

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.560
So let's get started.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.020
First I want to just kick
off with a stat.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.760
So recently, we announced that
we have a billion visitors on

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.610
YouTube every month.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.660
So if you think about it,
it's pretty astounding.

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:13.480
There are about 2 billion
connected internet users

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:14.660
around the world.

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.450
So we have one in two of those
internet connected users

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.050
visiting the site every month.

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:23.460
And it's clearly not just
a US phenomenon.

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.640
So about 70 percent of
our visitors come

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.200
from outside the US.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.520
Cool.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.170
So we know there's a huge
audience on YouTube.

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.530
I don't think that number is a
huge surprise to anyone here.

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.230
But what are they doing?

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:37.510
Well, they're watching video.

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.300
And they're also
sharing video.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.930
So every minute, about
700 videos get

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:43.710
shared on Twitter alone.

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.340
So in the course of the next
40 minutes, about 28,000

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.970
videos will be shared.

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.520
So we know that sharing
happens on Twitter.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:52.670
We know it happens on email.

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.960
We know it happens on other
social properties.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.360
And it happens on YouTube.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.900
So people are, this huge
audience is watching.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.650
And they're sharing.

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:01.910
Right.

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:05.080
So users are watching,
and they're sharing.

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.880
But how do we continue as a
platform to get great content

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.470
on YouTube?

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.070
So a key to making the long
term, a key to making this

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.010
ecosystem work in the long
term is making sure that

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.140
partners, those people that
actually create the content

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.890
that you watch, can make
a living off of this.

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.750
Can bring their content to
YouTube, quit their day jobs

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.230
and do what they love.

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.480
So recently we announced that
we have over 1,000 partners

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.230
making over $100,000 a year.

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.760
And to us, this means more
people can come on the

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.760
platform, create content and
quit their day jobs or

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.090
whatever they were
doing before.

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.250
And then, one last stat
I want to highlight.

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:58.050
So recently, Nielsen announced
that in the US, we reach more

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.140
18 to 34-year-olds than any
other cable network.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.020
So if you think about how your
customers are shifting to

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.040
mobile and how they're shifting
online, this is

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.670
pretty critical, that you
actually have a presence on

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.490
YouTube, where this target
audience for you, potentially,

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:18.750
these 18 to 34-year-olds, are
spending time watching video

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.610
and sharing.

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.910
OK.

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.800
So there's a huge audience
on YouTube.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.670
And they're watching
and sharing videos.

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:30.280
And key audiences for businesses
like yours, the 18

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.740
to 34-year-olds, are coming
online to view video.

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.060
So why does this actually
matter?

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.070
Why are we here talking
about it?

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:42.580
We believe fundamentally, and
we've seen examples that will

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.140
show, that sight, sound and
motion is really the best way

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.200
to communicate your value to
users and build a longer term

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.710
relationship.

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:54.500
So that sounds really abstract,
but let me talk

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.020
about what I mean.

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.410
So I'm going to tell
three stories.

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:01.270
The first story is, the other
day my friend Douglas shared a

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:02.920
video with me.

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.440
And I'm going to play
it quickly.

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.550
And then we'll talk about why
it's relevant for all

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:09.500
businesses and what we
can learn from it.

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:44.761
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:04:44.761 --> 00:04:45.500
All right.

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.760
So why did Douglas share
this video with me?

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.510
What's interesting about this?

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:50.502
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:50.502 --> 00:04:52.982
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:52.982 --> 00:04:55.700
LANE SHACKLETON: So most of us
don't seek out dental content

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.710
on YouTube like this.

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:59.870
But there are two things that
I think are relevant for all

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:01.030
businesses.

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:05.310
One is, this is really
the target audience.

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:06.590
They're reaching the
target audience

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:07.660
with relevant content.

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:11.480
So at the time, "Teach me how
to Dougie" was hot, the song

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.870
"Teach me how to Dougie." And
instead of creating a boring

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:17.265
video about how flossing is
important or brushing your

00:05:17.265 --> 00:05:19.970
teeth is important, they got
in the middle of the

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:22.200
conversation with those
teenagers that they were

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.030
trying to reach.

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:26.780
And I think this is something
that all businesses, again,

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:28.670
can learn from.

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:30.380
So remember, be relevant.

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:32.460
And when you can,
be entertaining.

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.980
There are lots of companies,
large and small.

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:38.990
They range from small start-ups
like Dollar Shave

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:43.110
Club all the way to established
brands like Oreo.

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:46.330
And the common thread between
all of them is that they're

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:47.560
following the trends.

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.990
They're being relevant to
conversations that are

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:51.880
happening outside of their
given industry.

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:55.840
OK.

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:56.980
Second story.

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:00.680
So last week I was going out
to dinner with my wife.

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:05.030
And I walked into the living
room, and she has a laptop

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:07.890
next to her and a scarf
in her hand, and she's

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:09.490
watching this video.

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:11.790
So let me play just a snippet of
this video, and then we'll

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:15.880
talk about what other marketers
can learn from this.

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:22.130
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:23.380
A.J. CRANE: Hm.

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:33.310
Oh.

00:06:38.475 --> 00:07:01.325
[VIDEO PLAYBACK RESUMES]

00:07:01.325 --> 00:07:04.400
LANE SHACKLETON: Thankfully,
that video played.

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.830
So this video is created by a
company here in San Francisco

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:09.150
called ModCloth.

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:12.980
And ModCloth sells things like
dresses and scarves.

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:15.330
But the other thing that they
do, in addition to selling

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:18.690
products, is that they create
great, fun, quick how-to

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:20.040
content like this.

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:23.140
So in this case, my wife wanted
to know how to tie the

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:26.420
scarf that she had bought that
day into something cool that

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:28.290
she could wear to dinner.

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:32.110
So again, ModCloth creating that
content that she'll come

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:35.490
back to later because she learns
to trust the brand for

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:36.740
how-to type content.

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:42.950
So keep in mind, as a business
owner, you're likely the

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:44.170
expert in your field.

00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:47.570
I think we forget that sometimes
as business owners.

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:49.300
Teach people about your
area of expertise.

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:52.430
You know more than a lot
of users about it.

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:54.180
And that's a great opportunity
to build

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:56.570
credibility with your audience.

00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:59.790
And I actually really believe
that this is one of the

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:03.650
easiest ways for businesses
to start creating content,

00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:07.780
whether it's demoing an app or
whether it's showing your

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:09.960
product in an interesting way.

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:13.390
This is something that most
businesses can do, and we've

00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:19.460
seen everyone from Airbnb to
Shopify to RevZilla get in the

00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:22.930
middle of these conversations
by teaching something that

00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:27.700
people already wanted
to know how to do.

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:29.840
OK, final story.

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:32.539
So my friend, Hunter, loves
sharing videos.

00:08:32.539 --> 00:08:35.600
I think we all have friends like
that, that send us too

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:36.760
many videos.

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:40.059
And awhile back, he shared this
video with me, and it's

00:08:40.059 --> 00:08:41.210
about skateboarding.

00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:43.419
So I want to show just
a snippet of this.

00:08:43.419 --> 00:08:46.570
And then, again, we'll talk
about why it's relevant for

00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:47.030
all businesses.

00:08:47.030 --> 00:09:47.210
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:48.070
LANE SHACKLETON: All right.

00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:50.150
So why did my friend Hunter
share this video with me?

00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:53.330
And why did I end up sharing
it with my friends?

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:54.670
Because it's interesting.

00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:55.630
It's inspirational.

00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:59.440
For those of us that love
getting outside and doing

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:03.000
alternative sports, this is
something that inspires us to

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.130
go do that, right?

00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:06.610
And it's in video form, with
sight, sound and motion.

00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:09.000
Well, There's two other things
I want to call out about this

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.970
video that break the
mold a little bit.

00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:13.760
One, it's over six
minutes long.

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:17.260
So traditionally, business
owners have thought, I have 15

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.390
or 30 seconds to tell
my message.

00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:22.110
And look, it's great to tell
your message quickly.

00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:25.870
But this is an example of longer
form content that users

00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:29.130
actually seek out and
try to watch.

00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:31.530
And they also share it with
their friends, because it's

00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:32.970
good content.

00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:35.930
Secondly, and I'm not sure if
you caught this, but in the

00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:38.860
title card, it said Part Four.

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:41.680
So the interesting thing about
this is that Original

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:44.980
Skateboards, they're creating
episodic content.

00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:47.510
This isn't just one viral
video or something.

00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:47.980
Right?

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:49.990
They're creating a whole
series of videos.

00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:53.490
So as a user, I know I'm
watching part four.

00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:56.620
But I can come back to the
channel again and again and

00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:57.870
get the other episodes.

00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:05.630
OK, so remember, when you can,
tell inspiring stories.

00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:09.880
Every business has a story, and
some of the best videos

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:14.240
that we see from business owners
are explaining to users

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:16.530
why they matter.

00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:19.780
And there are plenty of
examples, like Dove and GoPro

00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:22.520
and TRX that do this
exceptionally well.

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:24.950
So if you're looking for
ideas, check them out.

00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:29.650
OK, so there are lots of
different types of content

00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:32.150
that you can create
as a business.

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:33.530
And we've seen them all.

00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:36.570
But here are just three that
we've seen succeed with

00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:39.710
businesses both small
and large.

00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:42.590
So first, be relevant to
conversations that people are

00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:45.090
having outside of
your industry.

00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:48.640
I think sometimes we get
a little insulated.

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:52.010
And second, show people
something that they want to

00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:53.490
know how to do.

00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:55.110
Demo your product in
an interesting

00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:57.880
way, or teach something.

00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:02.660
Third, I think there's a huge
opportunity to inspire people.

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:05.070
This aspirational content
is a great way to

00:12:05.070 --> 00:12:06.630
draw users back in.

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:14.750
OK, so why did we just
talk about content?

00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:18.990
Fundamentally, we believe that
creating great content is the

00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:22.630
foundation for success as
a business on YouTube.

00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:27.440
And I encourage you, when you
think about your normal

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:31.430
content strategy or how your
marketing strategy works, to

00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:35.990
think about video and creating
content that feels more like

00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:41.370
the other content on YouTube
and less like a commercial.

00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:45.980
So A.J. Is going to walk you
through some tactics and bring

00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:50.250
up a special guest and talk
through what it looks like to

00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:54.230
build your presence on YouTube
after you've created content.

00:12:56.822 --> 00:12:58.180
A.J. CRANE: Thanks.

00:12:58.180 --> 00:12:59.950
So having great content
is clearly the

00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:01.720
most important thing.

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:03.725
But there's some other
optimizations you can make to

00:13:03.725 --> 00:13:06.180
make sure that people are
finding your content and to

00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:06.760
make sure that your

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:09.360
subscribers are staying engaged.

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:12.970
So we've actually bucketed these
two, these tips, into

00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:13.800
two buckets.

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:17.250
First, we'll start with
optimizations you can make to

00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:19.650
get your channel set
up and running.

00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:22.010
And then, second, we'll talk
about some activities you can

00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:25.180
think about on an ongoing, maybe
weekly basis, to make

00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:27.800
sure that people are
staying engaged.

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:31.810
So for this first part, we
actually have one of our top

00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:33.590
channels in the audience.

00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:36.270
And they've been kind enough to
let us set up their channel

00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:40.270
in the new One Channel design
which launched in March.

00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:42.520
And we'll also show you guys
some other tips too.

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:45.230
So I wanted to bring up Scott
from Original Skateboards.

00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:52.955
[APPLAUSE]

00:13:52.955 --> 00:13:55.400
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:57.985
SCOTT: I get music?

00:13:57.985 --> 00:13:59.270
A.J. CRANE: Thanks.

00:13:59.270 --> 00:14:02.882
SCOTT: Thanks for
having me, guys.

00:14:02.882 --> 00:14:03.610
A.J. CRANE: Awesome.

00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:03.750
Yeah.

00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:05.100
Thanks for coming up.

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:08.350
So before we get started, it
would be great if you could

00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:10.260
just tell the audience a little
bit about Original

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:13.425
Skateboards and how you guys got
started on the platform.

00:14:13.425 --> 00:14:16.200
SCOTT: Well, I mean, we've
been around since 2002.

00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:19.150
And I think since the beginning,
we really loved

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:19.840
three things.

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:22.950
We loved skateboarding, making
skateboards and watching

00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:25.100
skateboarding videos.

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:27.720
So we started in my parents'
garage when I was 19.

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:30.600
And we kind of did things the
old fashioned way for about

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:31.430
five years.

00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:34.650
We were cruising around,
stopping at every surf and

00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:37.850
skate shop we could find and
sleeping in a van sometimes,

00:14:37.850 --> 00:14:41.430
down by the river in
between motels.

00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:44.370
But it was really hard
to get the word out.

00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:47.100
It took a long time to drive up
and down the east coast and

00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:48.140
all the way out here,
out west.

00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:52.100
And we met some really
great people.

00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:55.770
But at some point, we realized
that we actually wanted to

00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:58.980
create stuff that we could
watch ourselves.

00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:01.350
So we had been watching
skateboard

00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:03.170
videos all of our lives.

00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:06.220
But we really didn't have
any of ourselves.

00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:08.840
So we actually started creating
videos not for

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:11.930
YouTube, because this was
before YouTube existed.

00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:15.280
The first videos we created with
Nick Patrick, who's our

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:19.240
amazing videographer,
They were for us.

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:20.780
So when we finally did
find out about

00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:22.740
YouTube, we had the content.

00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:26.080
And the content was set up as
something that we loved.

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:29.180
So your harshest critic is
always going to be yourself.

00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:31.610
So we'd been really critiquing
a lot of this stuff.

00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:35.050
And by the time we found
someplace, that happened to be

00:15:35.050 --> 00:15:39.120
YouTube, to upload it,
it was about 2007.

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:42.750
And we uploaded it and were
really questioning whether or

00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:44.320
not anyone would
ever watch it.

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:46.760
And I think about 700 people
watched it that day.

00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:48.380
And we were jumping
up and down.

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:49.940
It was insane.

00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:50.700
700 people.

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:53.180
Do you know how many
people that is?

00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:58.010
So, yeah, and then the next
day, we were all like, oh

00:15:58.010 --> 00:15:58.440
that's great.

00:15:58.440 --> 00:15:59.560
So a bunch of people
watched it.

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:01.930
But that's not going to
help pay the bills.

00:16:01.930 --> 00:16:05.770
And the next day we woke up, and
we had two orders, which

00:16:05.770 --> 00:16:07.250
was totally different because
we never really

00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:09.310
sold anything at night.

00:16:09.310 --> 00:16:13.000
So we were like, hey where
did those come from?

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:13.760
That's kind of weird.

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:18.270
Must be just a strange
coincidence.

00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:20.600
But the same thing happened
that day.

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:24.860
And pretty much, that day, our
business went up 40% overall.

00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:26.090
And it never went down.

00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:29.770
It's like, every day it went
up just a little bit more.

00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:32.280
And it took us a little while
to figure out that that was

00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:33.350
pretty much due to YouTube.

00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:35.920
But what was happening is I
think people were connecting

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:39.360
to our content because we loved
it and we were really

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:43.040
creating something that we
connected to personally.

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:46.560
So when you found someone
through YouTube that was like

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:49.030
us, they connected to it also.

00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:50.970
And then that just brought us
closer together with the

00:16:50.970 --> 00:16:52.410
people that supported us.

00:16:52.410 --> 00:16:54.440
And we started building
this little community.

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:57.680
And now, here we are with
500,000 subscribers,

00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:00.970
hopefully, tomorrow, which
is just totally

00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:02.440
insane, totally nuts.

00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:04.060
A.J. CRANE: Awesome.

00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:04.989
Cool.

00:17:04.989 --> 00:17:05.829
Well, thanks so much.

00:17:05.829 --> 00:17:08.125
So why don't we get started?

00:17:08.125 --> 00:17:08.710
SCOTT: Yeah.

00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:09.075
Let's do it.

00:17:09.075 --> 00:17:10.369
A.J. CRANE: Cool.

00:17:10.369 --> 00:17:13.480
OK, so the first thing that
we're going to, I guess we can

00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:14.035
take a seat.

00:17:14.035 --> 00:17:18.819
The first thing we're going to
set up is video branding.

00:17:18.819 --> 00:17:22.650
So most often, people will come
to your videos because

00:17:22.650 --> 00:17:24.069
someone shared it or
they found the

00:17:24.069 --> 00:17:25.359
video through a search.

00:17:25.359 --> 00:17:27.680
So when people are landing
directly on your videos, it's

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:30.590
really important that your
brand shines through

00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:31.940
right in the video.

00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:35.120
Because they may not have seen
your channel, of course.

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:38.540
So we recently launched a new
feature that makes this really

00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:39.240
easy to do.

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:41.180
It's called InVideo
programming.

00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:44.520
And what it allows you to do is
overlay either your channel

00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:48.060
icon or your logo directly
on all of your videos.

00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:49.260
And it's interactive.

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:52.030
So when someone clicks on it,
they can go directly back to

00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:55.780
your channel and find more
videos to watch or subscribe.

00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:58.150
So the great thing about doing
this through the tool versus

00:17:58.150 --> 00:18:00.960
burning it into your videos is
that it's interactive, which I

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:04.720
already mentioned, and that if
your logo ever changes for

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:06.140
whatever reason, you
won't need to

00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:07.440
reupload all of your videos.

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:10.720
You can just change it
en masse, at once.

00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:16.210
So Scott's team was kind enough
to provide a logo

00:18:16.210 --> 00:18:17.000
beforehand.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.940
So here we are in the InVideo
programming interface.

00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:23.100
And we can feature
your channel.

00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:26.880
So by default, it will show
your channel icon here.

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:30.310
But as I mentioned, you can
also upload a custom logo.

00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:32.070
SCOTT: Hopefully transparent.

00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:33.590
A.J. CRANE: Yeah, transparent
will look better.

00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:38.550
And there we go.

00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:39.970
So then, we just need
to answer a

00:18:39.970 --> 00:18:41.900
couple of other questions.

00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:44.480
You can choose to display
it in any corner.

00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:45.415
Which one do you like?

00:18:45.415 --> 00:18:47.170
SCOTT: Probably top
right's good.

00:18:47.170 --> 00:18:49.320
I don't think that's going to
go over the title card.

00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:49.810
So that's good.

00:18:49.810 --> 00:18:51.360
A.J. CRANE: Nice.

00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:53.880
And then, you can choose to have
it show in the beginning

00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:55.380
or for the whole thing.

00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:57.720
SCOTT: Probably the whole
thing, assuming that it

00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:00.350
doesn't go over the
title card.

00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:01.280
A.J. CRANE: Perfect.

00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:01.690
OK.

00:19:01.690 --> 00:19:03.710
So that's done.

00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:11.800
So let's check it out, back In
this video that we are playing

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:14.170
now it's really easy for anyone
to get back to your

00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:15.420
videos, or to your
channel page.

00:19:18.150 --> 00:19:22.450
So if branding your videos is
really important, probably the

00:19:22.450 --> 00:19:26.340
next most important thing is
branding your channel page.

00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:29.550
So we launched a new feature
with the OneChannel design

00:19:29.550 --> 00:19:30.940
called Channel Art.

00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:32.940
And the coolest thing about
Channel Art is it

00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:34.140
works on all devices.

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:36.930
And this is actually a big
upgrade from the previous

00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:41.460
design, where branding was
really only a desktop feature.

00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:43.970
So I actually took a few
screenshots of the Original

00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:47.150
Skateboards channel in the
current old design.

00:19:47.150 --> 00:19:50.460
And as you can see here, the
brand really doesn't transfer

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:52.220
through to the other devices.

00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:55.050
And that's our fault, because
the asset really

00:19:55.050 --> 00:19:55.940
only works on desktop.

00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:57.030
It's kind of the gutters.

00:19:57.030 --> 00:20:01.620
And there are no gutters
on mobile or on TV.

00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:04.720
So we thought about maybe
offering different images for

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:06.080
each platform.

00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:08.510
But that wasn't going to work
either, that would be kind of

00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:10.530
a moving target, with
new devices

00:20:10.530 --> 00:20:11.790
coming out every month.

00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:14.230
We'd have to constantly
hound people like

00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:15.320
Scott for new assets.

00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:16.650
And no one would like that.

00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:18.936
SCOTT: And we probably wouldn't
get them done.

00:20:18.936 --> 00:20:22.380
A.J. CRANE: So instead, we've
designed Channel Art to be a

00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:25.220
single simple asset that can be
cropped and scaled to work

00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:27.720
on all devices.

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:29.285
So let's set that up
on your channel.

00:20:29.285 --> 00:20:30.590
SCOTT: Sounds good.

00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:32.850
A.J. CRANE: So the first
thing we'll do is opt

00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:33.800
into the new design.

00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:35.720
So ready to do it?

00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:39.030
SCOTT: Yeah, let's change it.

00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:39.890
A.J. CRANE: OK.

00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:42.230
So this is your channel
in the new design.

00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:44.080
The first thing it's asking
us to do is to add

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:45.910
this channel art.

00:20:45.910 --> 00:20:49.220
So you can really easily
choose the

00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:51.802
image you guys created.

00:20:51.802 --> 00:20:53.370
SCOTT: And it was
actually great.

00:20:53.370 --> 00:20:55.410
We are lucky enough to have
a great designer.

00:20:55.410 --> 00:20:59.040
But there's some really awesome
guidelines that you

00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:01.905
can look up on how to actually
create art like this, so that

00:21:01.905 --> 00:21:04.511
it scales and works
really well.

00:21:04.511 --> 00:21:06.860
A.J. CRANE: So here, you
get a quick preview.

00:21:06.860 --> 00:21:09.140
So you get an idea of how this
image is going to be used on

00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:10.300
all three devices.

00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:12.560
And as Scott mentioned,
there's also templates

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:16.680
available if you want to
make it pixel perfect.

00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:19.780
So let's apply the image.

00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:21.420
And there we go.

00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:23.400
So I'm assuming you guys
probably want to drive people

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:25.950
back to OriginalSkateboards.com
in

00:21:25.950 --> 00:21:27.380
case they want to buy a board.

00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:28.680
SCOTT: That would be good.

00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:31.391
Or come and check out our
dealer list and find a

00:21:31.391 --> 00:21:34.045
skateboard shop near them
and then go buy a board.

00:21:34.045 --> 00:21:37.110
A.J. CRANE: OK, so we can
overlay a link back to their

00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:40.330
website by going to the About
tab and checking this box to

00:21:40.330 --> 00:21:44.030
overlay the first link
on their channel art.

00:21:44.030 --> 00:21:44.870
So there we go.

00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:47.430
So now their channel
art is all set up.

00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:49.450
And it should be working
across all devices.

00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:52.220
So we've branded the videos
and branded the channel.

00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:55.280
So next let's organize
your content.

00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:58.390
So the primary goal of this
channel page, other than

00:21:58.390 --> 00:22:00.830
showing your brand, is obviously
to help viewers find

00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:04.790
your videos and get them to
watch more of your content.

00:22:04.790 --> 00:22:08.060
So the new channel design has
a feature called Sections,

00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:10.240
which make it really easy to
see the different types of

00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:12.890
content and for your viewers
to browse and find

00:22:12.890 --> 00:22:14.300
something to watch.

00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:16.450
So let's add a couple sections
to your channel.

00:22:16.450 --> 00:22:19.730
So how do you guys think about
what kinds of content do you

00:22:19.730 --> 00:22:20.110
want to feature?

00:22:20.110 --> 00:22:21.500
SCOTT: I mean, we actually
do a lot of

00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:22.640
different kinds of videos.

00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:27.010
I mean, everything from the
ride inspiration, like you

00:22:27.010 --> 00:22:30.620
just get people excited to go
out and have fun like you guys

00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:33.830
showed earlier in "Go
Longboard," to a travel series

00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:36.440
to informational videos
about the product.

00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:37.850
A.J. CRANE: So put "Go
Longboard" on there?

00:22:37.850 --> 00:22:39.765
SCOTT: Yeah, definitely.

00:22:39.765 --> 00:22:44.230
It's episodic and by far our
most viral series, for sure.

00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:46.310
A.J. CRANE: All right.

00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:49.965
And then you also mentioned
the viral videos.

00:22:49.965 --> 00:22:51.210
SCOTT: Yeah, definitely.

00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:53.795
That kind of has videos other
than "Go Longboard" in it, but

00:22:53.795 --> 00:22:56.300
it does include "Go
Longboard" also.

00:22:56.300 --> 00:22:57.645
So that's perfect, too.

00:22:57.645 --> 00:22:58.380
A.J. CRANE: Cool.

00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:02.660
And then, the last
one was the--

00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:04.890
SCOTT: Yeah, we have the Product
Checkouts playlist,

00:23:04.890 --> 00:23:09.590
which is just a great place to
go and walk through what makes

00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:10.750
our boards special.

00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:13.632
So I think that's a really great
one to have up there.

00:23:13.632 --> 00:23:14.560
A.J. CRANE: Awesome.

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:16.300
So which one do you
want to be on top?

00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:19.600
SCOTT: Probably Viral Videos
first, and then Product

00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:21.910
Checkouts second, and
then "Go Longboard."

00:23:21.910 --> 00:23:22.570
A.J. CRANE: Perfect.

00:23:22.570 --> 00:23:23.100
All right.

00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:24.180
So there you go.

00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:26.350
So now all this content's layed
out in a really easy to

00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:27.490
browse fashion.

00:23:27.490 --> 00:23:30.900
And viewers can come and scroll
through this and really

00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:34.140
easily find the next video
they want to watch.

00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:37.540
So if getting viewers to watch
videos is our primary goal, a

00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:41.010
very close second here is
getting them to subscribe.

00:23:41.010 --> 00:23:42.950
Subscribers to your channel
are going to watch more of

00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:44.700
your videos and they're going
to come back to your channel

00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:45.740
more often.

00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:47.650
So it's really worth
it to invest in

00:23:47.650 --> 00:23:49.680
getting people to subscribe.

00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:52.380
So the best way that we
can do this is by

00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:54.690
showing them a video.

00:23:54.690 --> 00:23:57.930
So the new channel design has
a video player that only

00:23:57.930 --> 00:24:00.330
appears to unsubscribed
viewers.

00:24:00.330 --> 00:24:03.010
So this gives you the
opportunity to play a video

00:24:03.010 --> 00:24:07.310
that can really pitch people on
why they should subscribe.

00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:08.790
So Scott's team created
a trailer.

00:24:08.790 --> 00:24:12.380
So let's add this in.

00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:12.915
This one?

00:24:12.915 --> 00:24:13.610
SCOTT: Yeah.

00:24:13.610 --> 00:24:15.480
And hey, we just put it live
and it's already maxed the

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:16.010
view count out.

00:24:16.010 --> 00:24:16.280
So that's a good sign.

00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:18.170
A.J. CRANE: We literally
just put this live

00:24:18.170 --> 00:24:18.980
like 10 minutes ago.

00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:19.340
300 views.

00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:20.735
That's awesome.

00:24:20.735 --> 00:24:21.340
All right.

00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:22.810
So let's take a look at this.

00:24:22.810 --> 00:24:25.045
SCOTT: Yeah, it should just be
some, a little bit of skating,

00:24:25.045 --> 00:24:28.678
a little bit of everything.

00:24:28.678 --> 00:24:59.737
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:24:59.737 --> 00:25:00.450
A.J. CRANE: Awesome.

00:25:00.450 --> 00:25:02.250
SCOTT: So it's a little
difficult to tell a story in

00:25:02.250 --> 00:25:02.940
30 seconds.

00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:04.240
But we tried to do our best.

00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:04.540
A.J. CRANE: No.

00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:05.940
I'm going to subscribe.

00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:06.210
And--

00:25:06.210 --> 00:25:06.530
SCOTT: Cool.

00:25:06.530 --> 00:25:09.080
A.J. CRANE: --we can see how
effective this is by checking

00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:10.560
the number of attendees
verses new

00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:12.005
subscribers after the session.

00:25:12.005 --> 00:25:13.858
SCOTT: Definitely check that.

00:25:13.858 --> 00:25:15.310
A.J. CRANE: Awesome.

00:25:15.310 --> 00:25:16.790
So now the channel's
all set up.

00:25:16.790 --> 00:25:19.550
All we had to do was set up the
branding in the videos on

00:25:19.550 --> 00:25:21.640
the page, organize
your content and

00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:23.920
then upload the trailer.

00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:26.660
One other thing I wanted to note
here is, so the trailer

00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:28.160
is great for people
who aren't yet

00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:29.520
familiar with your content.

00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:32.740
But for people who are already
subscribed, the freshest,

00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:34.590
newest content is always
important to them.

00:25:34.590 --> 00:25:36.910
So they want to see videos
they haven't seen yet.

00:25:36.910 --> 00:25:38.440
So if you want to check out what
your channel's going to

00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:41.330
look like to people who are
subscribed, you can use this

00:25:41.330 --> 00:25:42.420
toggle here.

00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:44.080
And you'll see that a subscriber
will get a

00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:47.660
personalized recommendation of
what they should watch next

00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:49.480
based on what they've
already seen.

00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:51.710
So that will be really helpful
for getting more views from

00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:52.170
your subscribers.

00:25:52.170 --> 00:25:53.990
SCOTT: Yeah, it looks great.

00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:54.610
Definitely.

00:25:54.610 --> 00:25:55.350
I'm really excited.

00:25:55.350 --> 00:25:57.363
I mean I can't believe we
finally have a layout that's

00:25:57.363 --> 00:25:58.000
going to work in mobile.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.800
Which is totally worth
sacrificing the gutters.

00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:03.288
Absolutely.

00:26:03.288 --> 00:26:04.520
A.J. CRANE: Awesome.

00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:07.900
So I took some screenshots of,
now that we've uploaded the

00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:11.780
channel art, what it looks like
across all three devices.

00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:14.750
So you can now see the contrast
between a desktop

00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:18.280
only branded channel page versus
something that works on

00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:18.930
all devices.

00:26:18.930 --> 00:26:19.960
SCOTT: And TVs.

00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:21.250
A.J. CRANE: And TV.

00:26:21.250 --> 00:26:21.800
Coming soon.

00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:23.905
SCOTT: Yes.

00:26:23.905 --> 00:26:25.250
A.J. CRANE: Great.

00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:26.240
Thanks so much, Scott.

00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:27.120
SCOTT: Yeah, thanks for
having me, guys.

00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:28.466
A.J. CRANE: It's been great
having you guys up here and--

00:26:28.466 --> 00:26:29.398
SCOTT: Yeah.

00:26:29.398 --> 00:26:32.660
Hey, thanks for having us.

00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:35.930
A.J. CRANE: Be sure to check out
the Original Skateboards

00:26:35.930 --> 00:26:38.390
sandbox after this, if you
guys have any additional

00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:39.640
questions for Scott.

00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:46.550
OK, so you guys all saw how to
set up a channel and get off

00:26:46.550 --> 00:26:47.510
the ground.

00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:50.320
Next I wanted to talk through
some ongoing activities that

00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:51.850
you guys can think about
on a weekly basis.

00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:57.080
So first and foremost, the most
important thing you can

00:26:57.080 --> 00:26:58.500
do on YouTube is make
sure you're

00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:00.300
engaging with your fans.

00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:03.470
The YouTube audience loves an
open line of communication.

00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:06.110
And they love the fact that they
can talk freely with the

00:27:06.110 --> 00:27:08.090
creators of the content
that they love.

00:27:08.090 --> 00:27:11.360
So make sure that you're taking
advantage of that.

00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:13.495
Here you can see one of my
favorite channels, "Hilah in

00:27:13.495 --> 00:27:15.580
the Kitchen." And she
famously responds to

00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:16.980
her comments instantly.

00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:18.200
And you can see here
that she's even

00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:19.970
getting kudos for that.

00:27:19.970 --> 00:27:22.350
Think of someone commenting on
your video, like someone

00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:23.710
walking into your store.

00:27:23.710 --> 00:27:25.830
If they have a question for
you, you should be able to

00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:30.520
respond back immediately and
help make that sale or help

00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:34.000
answer whatever question
they may have.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.360
In addition to commenting on
videos, there's also a

00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:38.420
discussion tab that you
can enable right on

00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:39.780
your channel page.

00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:42.390
And this is a great place for
your fans to be able to leave

00:27:42.390 --> 00:27:45.320
ideas for you or comments
on your channel.

00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:48.445
And you can see here that Hilah
gets tons of ideas for

00:27:48.445 --> 00:27:49.640
her next video.

00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:53.340
And so fans will openly give you
ideas for your next video.

00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:56.280
Here she's got recommendations
to do gluten free videos and

00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:58.320
vegan videos.

00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:01.050
So thinking of new ideas
for videos is hard.

00:28:01.050 --> 00:28:03.710
And so having this constant
stream of ideas coming in from

00:28:03.710 --> 00:28:06.440
your fans is a really, really
helpful resource.

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:08.900
And the more you act on
that, the more your

00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:12.460
fans will engage further.

00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:15.370
So another great way to get
your audience involved is

00:28:15.370 --> 00:28:17.130
through Google+ Hangouts.

00:28:17.130 --> 00:28:19.460
So some of our creators on
YouTube have been using these

00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:21.170
in really, really
creative ways.

00:28:21.170 --> 00:28:24.340
And I wanted to share two
of my favorite examples.

00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:27.470
So this first one, "Pocketnow,"
is a tech

00:28:27.470 --> 00:28:28.760
reviewing channel.

00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:32.310
And they do a series every
week called "You Review,"

00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:35.370
where they will invite 10 of
their audience members or

00:28:35.370 --> 00:28:38.520
their fans to join in on the
Hangout, and then they'll all

00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:40.230
review the same product
at the same time.

00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:44.180
So here they're reviewing
the Galaxy S4.

00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:47.870
And this is kind of like a
modern take on the talk show.

00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:51.060
And so that's been a really
interesting example to see.

00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:53.850
Another totally different way
of using Hangouts is to do

00:28:53.850 --> 00:28:58.030
user support and Q&amp;A. So one of
our channels, "Indy Mogul,"

00:28:58.030 --> 00:29:02.560
who targets kind of amateur
filmmakers, he does a live Q&amp;A

00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:05.890
where he'll get some of his
fans on who have questions

00:29:05.890 --> 00:29:08.623
about how to recreate a specific
effect, and he'll

00:29:08.623 --> 00:29:10.820
answer it right then and there
and broadcast it on his

00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:13.970
channel, knowing that there's
probably someone else out

00:29:13.970 --> 00:29:16.030
there that has the same
question and he can

00:29:16.030 --> 00:29:17.280
help them out too.

00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:24.550
So it's key that you make sure
that you're posting new stuff

00:29:24.550 --> 00:29:26.570
to your channel page
very regularly.

00:29:26.570 --> 00:29:30.560
Because when you post something,
it shows up on the

00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:32.570
homepage of your subscribers.

00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:35.170
And make sure that you're kind
of remaining top of mind for

00:29:35.170 --> 00:29:37.670
the people that are subscribed
to your channel.

00:29:37.670 --> 00:29:40.490
So it's really hard to come up
with a new video to upload

00:29:40.490 --> 00:29:43.100
every week, or even
every other week.

00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:45.520
So a great way to kind of fill
the gaps between uploads and

00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:47.480
make sure that you're posting
fresh content

00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:49.180
is to curate content.

00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:51.620
And so you can curate content
by liking other people's

00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:54.490
videos, posting other videos,
or even adding

00:29:54.490 --> 00:29:57.020
other videos to playlists.

00:29:57.020 --> 00:29:59.500
So GoPro actually does
a great job of this.

00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:03.090
They have a playlist called "Fan
Favorites," and they will

00:30:03.090 --> 00:30:08.020
find a new fan video uploaded
and created on a GoPro and add

00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:10.890
it to their "Fan Favorites"
video playlist every week.

00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:15.320
So I know what you guys
are thinking.

00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:16.730
Of course GoPro can do this.

00:30:16.730 --> 00:30:18.940
They make a camera, and there's
probably lots of user

00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:20.880
generated content out there.

00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:22.480
But it's not only GoPro
that does this.

00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:25.290
I noticed the other day on the
Intel channel that they also

00:30:25.290 --> 00:30:27.120
have a Fan Favorites playlist.

00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:28.765
And check out the first
video in the playlist.

00:30:28.765 --> 00:30:38.845
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:30:38.845 --> 00:30:42.420
A.J. CRANE: So having someone
make a video about your brand

00:30:42.420 --> 00:30:45.360
is the highest compliment you
can receive, even if they're

00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:47.960
replacing your really expensive
marketing content

00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:51.140
with a screaming goat.

00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:54.150
So you can't be a bitter
person about this.

00:30:54.150 --> 00:30:56.770
You need to join in with the fun
and embrace the fact that

00:30:56.770 --> 00:30:58.920
people are creating
user generated

00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:00.420
content about your brand.

00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:03.380
And the YouTube community will
really appreciate this and

00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:04.610
respond well to it.

00:31:04.610 --> 00:31:08.730
You can even see that here,
Intel responded to this

00:31:08.730 --> 00:31:11.870
uploader in a humorous way.

00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:18.090
So for those of you who don't
know, goats that scream like

00:31:18.090 --> 00:31:21.840
humans were actually huge on
YouTube a couple months ago.

00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:25.100
And it seemed as though every
video that had a goat in it

00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:28.510
was really successful, and the
related video action was

00:31:28.510 --> 00:31:29.680
pretty good too.

00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:32.240
So how do you find out
about these trends?

00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:33.780
We have a resource for that.

00:31:33.780 --> 00:31:38.120
It's called the Trends
Dashboard, YouTube.com/trends.

00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:41.260
And this is a blog that's
curated by YouTubers and

00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:43.960
follows the latest trending
topics on the site.

00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:48.150
And it includes data and also
some live examples.

00:31:48.150 --> 00:31:50.650
So this is a great way to find
out what may be resonating

00:31:50.650 --> 00:31:53.550
with this core YouTube
audience.

00:31:53.550 --> 00:31:56.180
But of course you don't need to
be following the trends in

00:31:56.180 --> 00:31:58.160
order to be successful
on YouTube.

00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:00.980
Another way to find success
is to kind of nurture and

00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:02.825
understand your niche
or core audience.

00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:07.840
Looking into YouTube Analytics
is probably the best way to

00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:10.520
find out who your audience
really is.

00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:12.080
Sometimes you'll be surprised.

00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:14.170
For example, I recently
discovered that on my own

00:32:14.170 --> 00:32:16.430
channel, I have more
viewers in Poland

00:32:16.430 --> 00:32:17.800
than any other country.

00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:19.100
So who knew?

00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:22.000
But there's tons of other really
cool reports here.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.940
There's demographic report,
playback locations, and an

00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:27.500
audience retention report which
lets you know which

00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:29.650
parts of your video
are most engaging.

00:32:29.650 --> 00:32:31.700
So this is a really great way
to learn what you should be

00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:36.870
doing more of or maybe what you
should be doing less of.

00:32:36.870 --> 00:32:39.250
So lastly, I'm going to hand it
back over to Lane to talk

00:32:39.250 --> 00:32:42.130
for a little bit about how you
can promote your videos.

00:32:42.130 --> 00:32:42.860
LANE SHACKLETON: Great.

00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:45.870
So once you've got great content
and you've set up your

00:32:45.870 --> 00:32:49.490
channel, one thing that you may
want to do that businesses

00:32:49.490 --> 00:32:53.280
often do is promote their
content through paid

00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:54.280
advertising.

00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:58.280
So in this case, GoPro is
using a format that we

00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:00.580
released called Trueview
In-stream.

00:33:00.580 --> 00:33:02.840
And what Trueview In-stream
tries to do is balance the

00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:05.380
need of the user with
the advertiser.

00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:07.820
So you may have noticed
these on the site.

00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:09.640
They've been there for awhile.

00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:11.590
There's a skip button
on the ad.

00:33:11.590 --> 00:33:14.290
So the user gets a choice
in the ad experience.

00:33:14.290 --> 00:33:16.960
If they don't like the ad or
they're not interested, they

00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:18.420
just hit skip.

00:33:18.420 --> 00:33:22.250
And on the advertiser side, they
don't actually pay if the

00:33:22.250 --> 00:33:23.290
user skips.

00:33:23.290 --> 00:33:28.640
So the advertiser only pays if
someone watches the video,

00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:34.650
which creates the right set
of incentives on the site.

00:33:34.650 --> 00:33:36.870
And there's a really easy
way to set this up

00:33:36.870 --> 00:33:38.070
if you're on YouTube.

00:33:38.070 --> 00:33:40.830
So if you go to the YouTube
Video Manager and you're

00:33:40.830 --> 00:33:43.950
managing your videos, you
just click Promote.

00:33:43.950 --> 00:33:47.130
And you'll be dropped into
this little tool.

00:33:47.130 --> 00:33:51.080
This tool leads you to create an
AdWords for Video Campaign.

00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:53.240
And it's a three step process.

00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:57.700
And you tell us what video you
want to promote, what audience

00:33:57.700 --> 00:33:59.970
you want to reach and
what your budget is.

00:33:59.970 --> 00:34:05.380
And then we'll go out and show
this video to those users and

00:34:05.380 --> 00:34:08.429
help you build a long term
audience of viewers and

00:34:08.429 --> 00:34:09.679
subscribers.

00:34:11.868 --> 00:34:13.300
A.J. CRANE: Great, thanks.

00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:15.360
So we shared a lot of
information with you guys.

00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:18.260
So I just wanted to recap
really quickly.

00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:19.570
Tips for setting up
your channel.

00:34:19.570 --> 00:34:21.889
Make sure that you're branding
your videos and branding your

00:34:21.889 --> 00:34:23.580
actual channel page.

00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:26.090
Organize your content in a way
that makes it easy for people

00:34:26.090 --> 00:34:28.800
to browse and find
what to watch.

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:31.500
Create a trailer so that you
can convert unsubscribed

00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:33.590
visitors to subscribers.

00:34:33.590 --> 00:34:35.800
And then, on an ongoing basis,
making sure that you're

00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:38.780
engaging with your community
through comments, discussion

00:34:38.780 --> 00:34:42.370
and through Google+ Hangouts.

00:34:42.370 --> 00:34:46.330
Curate fan content using likes
or playlists to fill the gap

00:34:46.330 --> 00:34:48.449
between uploads.

00:34:48.449 --> 00:34:50.290
Making sure you're staying on
top of the trends with the

00:34:50.290 --> 00:34:52.060
Trends Dashboard.

00:34:52.060 --> 00:34:54.280
Keeping an eye on your numbers
through YouTube Analytics to

00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:56.510
find out who your audience
really is.

00:34:56.510 --> 00:35:00.100
And then also, thinking about
promoting your videos.

00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:02.990
So all these tips are
really important.

00:35:02.990 --> 00:35:06.170
But not as important as making
sure that you're creating

00:35:06.170 --> 00:35:08.940
great content, which Lane talked
about at the beginning.

00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:10.720
So content is king on YouTube.

00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:14.280
And all of these things will
help you get more visibility,

00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:18.220
but content is really the
most important thing.

00:35:18.220 --> 00:35:20.130
So lastly, we just wanted
to leave you

00:35:20.130 --> 00:35:22.410
guys with a few resources.

00:35:22.410 --> 00:35:24.820
There's the Creator Hub, which
has more case studies and

00:35:24.820 --> 00:35:29.230
examples of successful stories
on YouTube, the Creator

00:35:29.230 --> 00:35:31.810
Playbook, which has a checklist
of basically

00:35:31.810 --> 00:35:35.800
everything we discussed today
and more, Trends Dashboard for

00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:40.400
finding out what's hot on
YouTube right now, and the Ads

00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:43.520
Leader board which has some
really great examples of

00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:45.880
content from small businesses
and marketers that have been

00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:47.230
successful.

00:35:47.230 --> 00:35:48.040
and lastly--

00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:54.290
/advertise and /dev for both
of those audiences.

00:35:54.290 --> 00:35:54.600
Cool.

00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:56.830
So lastly, we just wanted to
open it up to questions.

00:35:56.830 --> 00:36:00.780
And feel free to direct
questions at us or also at

00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:02.595
Scott from Original
Skateboards.

00:36:02.595 --> 00:36:04.020
LANE SHACKLETON: And
please use the mic.

00:36:06.948 --> 00:36:11.200
AUDIENCE: Hey, so I have a
question about promotions.

00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:14.350
So one of the things I've
noticed, both with my own

00:36:14.350 --> 00:36:17.650
channel and other people who
I've helped do the marketing

00:36:17.650 --> 00:36:21.980
portion of their channels,
is that when you set up a

00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:24.840
promotional campaign, sometimes
it takes days and

00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:26.700
days before it actually
gets approved.

00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:29.550
Is there any way to speed
up that process?

00:36:29.550 --> 00:36:31.710
LANE SHACKLETON: We are
very sorry about that.

00:36:31.710 --> 00:36:33.900
AUDIENCE: And it's very
unpredictable.

00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:37.480
Sometimes it's less than an hour
turnaround, and sometimes

00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:39.075
it's almost a week.

00:36:39.075 --> 00:36:41.850
LANE SHACKLETON: So we
also noticed this.

00:36:41.850 --> 00:36:45.430
And we kicked off a whole
team that is looking at

00:36:45.430 --> 00:36:47.640
this within the team.

00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:52.620
So we have over three people
working on this right now, and

00:36:52.620 --> 00:36:55.370
we're about to launch some
really cool stuff that will

00:36:55.370 --> 00:36:59.630
actually speed up that approval
process significantly

00:36:59.630 --> 00:37:01.182
in the coming months.

00:37:01.182 --> 00:37:02.580
AUDIENCE: And so the other thing
I've noticed about that

00:37:02.580 --> 00:37:04.700
is that it doesn't seem to
matter how much money you're

00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:05.370
willing to spend.

00:37:05.370 --> 00:37:09.150
Because you can have an
AdWords rep for your

00:37:09.150 --> 00:37:13.580
pay-per-click spend, and it's
completely ignored.

00:37:13.580 --> 00:37:15.350
They're two separate universes,
seemingly.

00:37:15.350 --> 00:37:16.170
LANE SHACKLETON: Yeah.

00:37:16.170 --> 00:37:18.400
We feel your pain.

00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:21.630
And we absolutely want to
solve that problem.

00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:23.650
It's in our, both of
our best interests.

00:37:27.298 --> 00:37:31.090
AUDIENCE: With the integration
more of the Google+ assets,

00:37:31.090 --> 00:37:33.980
Hangout and so forth, with
YouTube, what's the best

00:37:33.980 --> 00:37:36.650
method to get your subscribers
basically

00:37:36.650 --> 00:37:38.180
hooked into +1 [? U-1 ?]

00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:40.596
on G+?

00:37:40.596 --> 00:37:42.570
A.J. CRANE: So the question is,
what's the best way to get

00:37:42.570 --> 00:37:46.580
a subscriber also hooked
in to follow on G+?

00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:51.650
Well, if you do link accounts,
your Google+ page will

00:37:51.650 --> 00:37:53.830
automatically be linked
from your channel.

00:37:53.830 --> 00:37:57.780
So that's a great way to drive
people back and forth.

00:37:57.780 --> 00:38:01.040
To get someone else to follow
you on Google+, you could use

00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:02.290
in-video annotations.

00:38:05.410 --> 00:38:07.855
The best way is usually to ask
people in your video to follow

00:38:07.855 --> 00:38:09.326
you on Google+.

00:38:09.326 --> 00:38:11.720
And you can always link from
underneath the video.

00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:15.130
But the actions currently are
still separate, subscribing

00:38:15.130 --> 00:38:18.210
and following.

00:38:18.210 --> 00:38:20.880
I forgot to mention, too, on
the channel art, that your

00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:23.470
channel art is actually the
same specs as your Google+

00:38:23.470 --> 00:38:25.760
page artwork.

00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:27.630
So you can use the same image
in both locations.

00:38:30.834 --> 00:38:33.380
AUDIENCE: I'm Mark
from Pixability.

00:38:33.380 --> 00:38:38.280
I'm wondering about an API
for promoting videos.

00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:41.540
Is that coming any time
soon in the timeline?

00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:44.932
And we can talk about
this offline.

00:38:44.932 --> 00:38:46.350
LANE SHACKLETON: Sure.

00:38:46.350 --> 00:38:51.340
So enabling the features that
are involved in an API, things

00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:54.240
like bulk editing, are certainly
something that we

00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:56.130
care a lot about.

00:38:56.130 --> 00:38:58.930
I think it's worth mentioning,
when you think about AdWords

00:38:58.930 --> 00:39:02.410
for Video, it's still an
incredibly nascent platform.

00:39:02.410 --> 00:39:08.220
So it was launched literally
about April 2012.

00:39:08.220 --> 00:39:12.040
So from our perspective, we want
to make sure that we're

00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:17.630
doing a great job for small,
medium, large users before we

00:39:17.630 --> 00:39:22.020
focus on some of those
external APIs.

00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:26.330
One thing that we're launching
very soon is CSV import.

00:39:26.330 --> 00:39:27.360
So you've probably heard this.

00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:28.830
You're smiling.

00:39:28.830 --> 00:39:33.330
So we plan to release this to
enable some of those bulk

00:39:33.330 --> 00:39:34.900
editing functions.

00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:36.850
And an API is certainly
something that

00:39:36.850 --> 00:39:37.550
we're thinking about.

00:39:37.550 --> 00:39:40.300
But I don't have anything
to announce here.

00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:41.600
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:43.800
We're very happy to give you
feedback for that API.

00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:45.970
And also to do some
data testing.

00:39:45.970 --> 00:39:48.510
LANE SHACKLETON: I'd be glad
to hear that feedback.

00:39:48.510 --> 00:39:49.968
AUDIENCE: Cheers, thank you.

00:39:54.828 --> 00:39:56.078
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:12.650 --> 00:40:14.750
It costs money to
create a video.

00:40:14.750 --> 00:40:18.851
And then I'm interested
in ROI.

00:40:18.851 --> 00:40:19.810
LANE SHACKLETON: Yeah.

00:40:19.810 --> 00:40:20.680
That's a great question.

00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:26.010
So how many people saw the video
that later downloaded?

00:40:26.010 --> 00:40:30.390
So I'll actually connect
you with a mobile

00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:31.490
person after this.

00:40:31.490 --> 00:40:35.350
But one of the things that we
are thinking about is how to

00:40:35.350 --> 00:40:40.120
enable people to understand
moving from videos into apps

00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:41.420
and app downloads.

00:40:41.420 --> 00:40:44.770
That's not a use case that
we've nailed yet.

00:40:44.770 --> 00:40:46.230
I'll be frank with you.

00:40:46.230 --> 00:40:49.620
But it is, I think that's
a case that we should be

00:40:49.620 --> 00:40:50.610
thinking more about.

00:40:50.610 --> 00:40:54.645
And I believe there's also
something on the mobile side

00:40:54.645 --> 00:40:55.770
that can be done.

00:40:55.770 --> 00:40:56.540
But I'd like to--

00:40:56.540 --> 00:40:59.180
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:59.180 --> 00:41:01.610
LANE SHACKLETON: Yeah, certainly
you can use things

00:41:01.610 --> 00:41:03.850
like annotations to drive
people to that video.

00:41:03.850 --> 00:41:07.610
I'm just thinking of actually
linking that download back to

00:41:07.610 --> 00:41:10.000
the specific video view.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:12.320
I'm probably not the
expert there.

00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:14.820
Actually, we're out of time.

00:41:14.820 --> 00:41:18.620
AUDIENCE: Actually, a couple of
hacks for that would be to

00:41:18.620 --> 00:41:22.660
provide a unique link in the
description and also buy

00:41:22.660 --> 00:41:24.860
enough of a promotional campaign
so you get the call

00:41:24.860 --> 00:41:28.245
to action overlay, and then
track them that way.

00:41:28.245 --> 00:41:30.290
LANE SHACKLETON: Yeah, certainly
a unique URL is a

00:41:30.290 --> 00:41:30.950
great way to do that.

00:41:30.950 --> 00:41:32.200
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:39.314 --> 00:41:40.890
LANE SHACKLETON: Yeah it's
worth investing.

00:41:40.890 --> 00:41:42.250
We're actually out of time.

00:41:42.250 --> 00:41:44.930
So let's follow up after.

00:41:44.930 --> 00:41:45.610
Thank you so much.

00:41:45.610 --> 00:41:46.210
A.J. CRANE: Yeah.

00:41:46.210 --> 00:41:47.460
Thanks for coming!
