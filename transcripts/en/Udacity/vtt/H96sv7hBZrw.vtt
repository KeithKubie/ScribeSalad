00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.170
What I'd like to try, is for you guys to

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:04.560
tell me individually, what's more important to you to find out

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.590
from your genome? Would you be more interested in the

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:10.060
ancestry information, or the health information that it could give you.

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.500
Ginny, why don't you tell us, is there, is the one, more than the other?

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.550
&gt;&gt; Because Achondroplasia comes with the myriad of medical

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.069
complications, I would be more interested in the medical

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:23.840
&gt;&gt; Okay. Kagure?

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:29.950
&gt;&gt; I think it's medical.

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:36.710
I give medical maybe 60 per, 50, 80% and ancestry 20.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:37.270
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:44.070
&gt;&gt; I think it's medical, but it's really tough, because I am also very curious

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.360
about the ancestry. Particularly, particularly being Jewish,

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.960
and not being able to go back that far with the relatives who

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.950
came from Eastern Europe. Not being able to know who

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.940
these people were. Is, you know, kind of, if we could find something

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.489
out, that would be great.

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.670
&gt;&gt; For me, the ancestry is my, you know,

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.550
the first thing that makes me want to, the first

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.560
kind of information I want, and then the medical

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.390
would be something I would keep checking long term.

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.860
&gt;&gt; I guess mine would, would be the ancestry although the

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.580
medical is, is also important to me, but definitely the ancestry.

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.020
&gt;&gt; That means the information can actually change

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.730
anything, or is it just going to inform you?

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:33.230
&gt;&gt;

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.870
I definitely think it has the potential to change quite a bit. I mean

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:47.820
reconnecting with my biological parents is such an experience, that I think even

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.030
though I have my real parents now

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.920
that will always provide the support regardless

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.550
of me finding my biological parents. I

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.670
think having that connection, that new individual

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.480
in my life, will have a profound impact on me, as well as

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.539
the medical information, like it has the potential to have a profound impact.

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.280
&gt;&gt; What about you, Ryan? You think it

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.190
would change how you act, how you behave?

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.880
&gt;&gt; I don't think so. I think for me, it's more of just learning about me and

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.730
my personal, you know, my personal genetics and also

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.468
my ancestry. It's just more of a, you know,

00:02:25.468 --> 00:02:27.120
it's a curiosity thing.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.493
&gt;&gt; Carol?

00:02:28.493 --> 00:02:30.420
&gt;&gt; Anxiety.

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.877
[LAUGH]

00:02:32.877 --> 00:02:35.110
&gt;&gt; Causing more anxiety or less anxiety?

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:36.810
&gt;&gt; Causing more anxiety!

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.400
Not, of not knowing what's ahead. Of course, we don't know

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:48.610
anyway, but when there's some prediction that there's a possibility. And

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:55.230
understanding statistics and percentages, of possibilities that creates some

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:02.305
anxiety. but I can convince myself, that it's good to know and take action.

00:03:02.305 --> 00:03:02.683
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:03:02.683 --> 00:03:04.830
&gt;&gt; So I'm pragmatic,

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:10.230
but at the same time, it does produce a certain amount of anxiety for me.

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.760
&gt;&gt; Jenny?

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.650
&gt;&gt; I'm thinking about this question from the perspective of my average size

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.560
parents, and then 30 years later from me, when I was expecting a

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.320
child. And so they're two different things. I'm a mutation, so I came

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:30.009
out of, from nowhere, you know, unexpectedly with my parents. when they found

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:32.460
out, when the diagnosis was confirmed, I was 18

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:35.490
months old. And that allowed them, to just get right

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:39.620
on track with Little People of America, the national support

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.520
group finding the top orthopedic surgeons in the area. That

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.230
sort of thing. So I think that it was really

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.050
helpful for them. Of course I don't remember that, I

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:51.620
was 18 months old. as far as, you know, when

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.190
I was pregnant again, it goes back to knowing ahead

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.130
of time what, what was inside of me, and

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:01.310
what we had to prepare for was, was monumental.

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.441
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.
