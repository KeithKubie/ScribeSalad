00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.800
Twelve things introverts are best at doing.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.520
Six: Being great workers.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.860
Alongside being great leaders, introverts

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.000
also know very well know when to take a step back,

00:00:21.005 --> 00:00:23.885
and get the work done. They're attentive,

00:00:23.885 --> 00:00:27.025
whole-hearted, determined, and motivated to always do their

00:00:27.025 --> 00:00:28.025
very best.

00:00:28.305 --> 00:00:30.585
Since introverts usually don't use their words,

00:00:30.585 --> 00:00:33.625
or quick wit to talk them out of sticky situations,

00:00:33.625 --> 00:00:36.305
they use their intellectual prowess to provide an

00:00:36.305 --> 00:00:39.205
answer rather than an excuse. Hand them an extended

00:00:39.205 --> 00:00:42.295
project and let them work alone in a comfortable enviroment

00:00:42.295 --> 00:00:44.795
and you'll get incredible results.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.500
Introverts need a little supervision because

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.555
they're always triple checking themselves, seeing the flaws in everything

00:00:50.555 --> 00:00:53.565
and preparing every argument that could be made against their work

00:00:53.575 --> 00:00:56.705
and working around it to avoid said confrontation.

00:00:57.415 --> 00:00:59.775
These qualities make them effective followers as well

00:00:59.775 --> 00:01:03.015
being dedicated to the completion of their responsibility,

00:01:03.015 --> 00:01:05.175
provided their solitude is undisturbed.

00:01:06.485 --> 00:01:09.305
Seven: listening to your troubles.

00:01:09.535 --> 00:01:12.195
Have you ever needed to vent? Confided in a close

00:01:12.195 --> 00:01:15.355
friend and felt like they weren't really even listening to you?

00:01:15.505 --> 00:01:18.535
That's the opposite of an introvert. Since introverts

00:01:18.535 --> 00:01:21.555
know how hard it is for them to express their emotions verbally

00:01:21.555 --> 00:01:24.500
if a love one expresses feelings to them, they will listen hard

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.485
and well.

00:01:25.695 --> 00:01:28.585
Introverts are perfect for when you need a shoulder to cry on

00:01:28.585 --> 00:01:31.515
or just someone to hear your story. As said earlier,

00:01:31.515 --> 00:01:33.905
introverts hate small talk,

00:01:33.905 --> 00:01:36.975
so if you go straight to the meaty, deep talk, they'll provide

00:01:36.975 --> 00:01:40.385
an impeccable set of ears and even some incredible advice for you to follow.

00:01:41.135 --> 00:01:44.005
Introverts are sensitive to pain; their own AND

00:01:44.005 --> 00:01:47.345
others. They can tell when you're really upset or when you need

00:01:47.345 --> 00:01:50.225
to get something off your chest. If a reserved

00:01:50.225 --> 00:01:53.105
friend asks you if everything's all right, there's no need to hide

00:01:53.105 --> 00:01:56.300
behind another "I'm fine, I'm just tired."

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.605
Go ahead and tell them what's bothering you. There's no better

00:01:59.605 --> 00:02:01.720
support than that of an introverted friend.

00:02:02.705 --> 00:02:04.485
Eight: counseling.

00:02:04.925 --> 00:02:07.325
In addition to listening, introverts excel

00:02:07.325 --> 00:02:11.480
at helping you cope with your worries. They can easily read people while others

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.295
are just listening, an introvert

00:02:13.295 --> 00:02:16.255
analyzes and interprets the speaker's thoughts, actions

00:02:16.255 --> 00:02:19.345
choice of words, and preconceptions.

00:02:19.345 --> 00:02:22.775
They can notice little body expressions you don't even realize you're doing.

00:02:23.075 --> 00:02:26.120
They can help you pin down exactly what's bothering you and even

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.800
suggest how to resolve it.

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.840
Unfortunately, many introverts are familiar

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.360
with pain and suffering, so they're quite experienced on how to alleviate any emotional pain you're going through.

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.480
Furthermore, calming someone down isn't all about

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.120
talking. It's about

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.300
understanding and making deep relationships built on trust.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.460
Being empathetic is what introverts do.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.440
Having someone there and listening and supporting you in a time of need

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.145
is just as comforting as a nice, warm hug. Which

00:02:54.145 --> 00:02:57.195
many introverts may often initiate in moments like these.

00:02:58.015 --> 00:03:01.115
Nine: Thinking before acting.

00:03:02.035 --> 00:03:05.135
Introverts don't speak quite often, so when they do,

00:03:05.135 --> 00:03:07.935
every single word was chosen

00:03:07.935 --> 00:03:10.355
very carefully ahead of time. Sometimes

00:03:10.355 --> 00:03:13.425
due to this introverts may take a while to get a sentence out

00:03:13.425 --> 00:03:16.425
since they're mentally preparing and rehearsing each word

00:03:16.425 --> 00:03:17.625
before they say it.

00:03:17.995 --> 00:03:20.905
Since introverts take a while to express themselves,

00:03:20.905 --> 00:03:23.960
many extroverts just ignore them and talk over them.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.645
This can cause introverts to become even more shy

00:03:26.645 --> 00:03:29.400
so that they don't get ignored again. As this is traumatic

00:03:29.405 --> 00:03:31.945
and embarrassing. So if your introverted

00:03:31.945 --> 00:03:34.865
friend speaks up, pay close attention because

00:03:34.865 --> 00:03:37.675
what he or she has to say is probably important.

00:03:39.095 --> 00:03:42.185
Ten: Knowing themselves.

00:03:42.185 --> 00:03:45.285
We all know that quiet persons have the loudest minds.

00:03:45.285 --> 00:03:48.315
Introverts spend a lot of time in their own heads.

00:03:48.315 --> 00:03:50.745
From this they know themselves pretty well.

00:03:50.935 --> 00:03:53.595
Aside from being silent critics, introverts

00:03:53.595 --> 00:03:56.675
are constantly having inner monologues, evaluating themselves

00:03:56.675 --> 00:03:59.165
and their choices in every day situations.

00:03:59.165 --> 00:04:02.145
Thus they rarely have any existential crisis,

00:04:02.145 --> 00:04:05.135
and can easily figure out their strengths and weaknesses.

00:04:05.135 --> 00:04:08.055
They know who they are, what they want, and what is important to them.

00:04:08.225 --> 00:04:10.945
They might just not tell you all of that information.

00:04:10.945 --> 00:04:13.595
You could say that they're silent, but confident.

00:04:14.295 --> 00:04:16.775
Eleven: Being a source of wisdom.

00:04:17.975 --> 00:04:21.045
By nature, introverts love information,

00:04:21.045 --> 00:04:24.399
learning, and discovering new things. They might not be the first

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.920
to go mountain climbing, but they'll definitely be in awe

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.280
over a new NASA discovery.

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.760
Their minds are constantly urging for more facts and things to ponder over

00:04:32.765 --> 00:04:35.635
in the silence of their daily lives.

00:04:35.635 --> 00:04:38.125
Not only that, but they use these interesting facts and

00:04:38.125 --> 00:04:41.485
information to share with others when the time is relevant. So you never know

00:04:41.525 --> 00:04:44.165
when your small-voiced friend might know the exact answer to

00:04:44.165 --> 00:04:46.925
your problems after reading about a similar situation

00:04:46.925 --> 00:04:47.925
months ago.

00:04:48.295 --> 00:04:50.665
Twelve: Being a loyal friend.

00:04:50.925 --> 00:04:53.935
Introvert friends will not betray you. They have no

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.765
reason to. They would never talk about you behind your back

00:04:56.765 --> 00:04:59.780
or lie to you in a harmful way. Every secret

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.665
desire or dream you've ever shared with them will

00:05:02.665 --> 00:05:05.805
always be safe whether or not the friendship lasts.

00:05:05.805 --> 00:05:08.780
Introverts cherish friendships and no matter the circumstances,

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:11.700
would never betray someone who once confided in them.

00:05:11.975 --> 00:05:14.905
They value relationships and try hard to keep them

00:05:14.905 --> 00:05:17.555
which makes them some of the best friends you will ever have.

00:05:18.515 --> 00:05:21.085
Introverts have quiet a lot of skills in those quiet

00:05:21.085 --> 00:05:23.300
little bodies. If you're an extrovert, don't

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.380
be hesitant to communicate with silent peers

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:29.560
You'll be surprised at what they're capable of. And if you're an introvert,

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.580
be proud. You have nothing to feel inferior

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.925
about since behind that shyness lies a storm

00:05:34.925 --> 00:05:36.220
of talents.

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.180
