00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.030 align:start position:0%
bison I am assuming because the first
 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:27.610 align:start position:0%
bison I am assuming because the first
time<00:05:26.210><c> he</c><00:05:26.390><c> blows</c><00:05:26.630><c> that</c><00:05:26.870><c> the</c><00:05:26.960><c> flying</c><00:05:27.169><c> bison</c>

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.620 align:start position:0%

time he blows that the flying bison
doesn't<00:05:27.950><c> come</c><00:05:28.160><c> I</c><00:05:28.460><c> only</c><00:05:29.060><c> comes</c><00:05:29.360><c> the</c><00:05:29.570><c> second</c>

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:29.930 align:start position:0%
doesn't come I only comes the second
