00:00:00.522 --> 00:00:02.571
- [Voiceover] A lot of
users of Khan Academy

00:00:02.571 --> 00:00:03.832
especially teachers

00:00:03.832 --> 00:00:06.525
don't fully know how much we have mapped

00:00:06.525 --> 00:00:08.053
and how much we have invested

00:00:08.053 --> 00:00:10.876
in the actual Common Core

00:00:10.876 --> 00:00:12.922
and as I often point out to folks,

00:00:12.922 --> 00:00:14.424
a standard is one thing

00:00:14.424 --> 00:00:15.978
and the Common Core standards

00:00:15.978 --> 00:00:19.038
are definitely more rigorous
than traditional standards,

00:00:19.038 --> 00:00:21.054
much more focused on conceptual learning

00:00:21.054 --> 00:00:22.934
but what really matters for a standard

00:00:22.934 --> 00:00:24.333
is how it's implemented

00:00:24.333 --> 00:00:26.098
and how it is assessed.

00:00:26.098 --> 00:00:27.288
So over the last few years,

00:00:27.288 --> 00:00:28.661
we've taken great effort

00:00:28.661 --> 00:00:31.436
to create over a 150 thousand exercises

00:00:31.436 --> 00:00:33.610
and many thousands of videos

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.515
that are directly aligned
to the Common Core,

00:00:36.515 --> 00:00:38.763
explicitly created for the Common Core

00:00:38.763 --> 00:00:39.623
and not only that

00:00:39.623 --> 00:00:40.768
but they have been vetted

00:00:40.768 --> 00:00:42.486
by the authors of the Common Core

00:00:42.486 --> 00:00:44.131
and we've correlated them

00:00:44.131 --> 00:00:47.477
with performance on Common Core exams.

00:00:47.477 --> 00:00:50.422
So if you're a teacher,
a student or a parent

00:00:50.422 --> 00:00:51.281
and want to explore

00:00:51.281 --> 00:00:53.429
the Common Core resources we have,

00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:57.330
I suggest that you go to
khanacademy.org/commoncore

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:58.199
or from there

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.624
and you can see that we
have some resources here

00:01:00.624 --> 00:01:04.225
that describe what we have on Common Core

00:01:04.225 --> 00:01:05.747
and how our materials

00:01:05.747 --> 00:01:08.847
have even involved some of the people

00:01:08.847 --> 00:01:10.559
who are assessing the Common Core

00:01:10.559 --> 00:01:12.850
or some of the Illustrative Mathematics

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:13.920
is run by Bill McCallum

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.640
who's one of the authors
of the Common Core

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:16.918
on the math side.

00:01:16.918 --> 00:01:19.612
But if you actually want to look at

00:01:19.612 --> 00:01:22.659
what we have by standard,

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:27.355
you can click on Browse
our Common Core map

00:01:27.355 --> 00:01:29.082
and you will go right over here

00:01:29.082 --> 00:01:30.676
and you can see you can download it

00:01:30.676 --> 00:01:35.667
as a kind of comma file or
CSV comma separated files

00:01:35.667 --> 00:01:40.667
and that you can read on
Excel or on a spreadsheet

00:01:40.906 --> 00:01:42.740
but you could also navigate it over here

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.851
and so you can see all of
the different grade levels

00:01:45.851 --> 00:01:47.314
that are associated with the Common Core.

00:01:47.314 --> 00:01:48.140
Once you get into high school,

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.838
it's much more by I
guess you can say class

00:01:50.838 --> 00:01:52.389
or subject area

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:54.797
and if we pick a grade level,

00:01:54.797 --> 00:01:57.168
let's say grade six

00:01:57.168 --> 00:01:58.315
and you could see already here

00:01:58.315 --> 00:02:00.197
that there's 107 skills

00:02:00.197 --> 00:02:02.568
but each of those skills
has many questions involved

00:02:02.568 --> 00:02:05.145
so there's 2678 questions

00:02:05.145 --> 00:02:06.528
and you could click there

00:02:06.528 --> 00:02:08.174
and you can see the different standards

00:02:08.174 --> 00:02:09.481
and this is the actual description

00:02:09.481 --> 00:02:11.924
of the Common Core standards

00:02:11.924 --> 00:02:14.223
and then you can see visual pictures

00:02:14.223 --> 00:02:17.045
of the different exercises

00:02:17.045 --> 00:02:19.177
that we have for those standards

00:02:19.177 --> 00:02:20.276
and so if you,

00:02:20.276 --> 00:02:23.468
over here you see these
major themes in grade six,

00:02:23.468 --> 00:02:25.719
geometry, ratios and
proportional relationships,

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:27.763
number system, expression and equations,

00:02:27.763 --> 00:02:29.321
statistics and probability

00:02:29.321 --> 00:02:30.911
and so you can click on any one of them

00:02:30.911 --> 00:02:33.522
until you can see the types of things

00:02:33.522 --> 00:02:35.927
that Khan Academy actually has

00:02:35.927 --> 00:02:39.249
and you can click on any of these

00:02:39.249 --> 00:02:41.168
to go to the exercises

00:02:41.168 --> 00:02:42.391
and if you are a teacher,

00:02:42.391 --> 00:02:43.783
this is actually a good way to explore,

00:02:43.783 --> 00:02:45.373
hey, is this something
that might be appropriate

00:02:45.373 --> 00:02:46.560
for my students?

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.735
You can then look at the URL up here

00:02:49.735 --> 00:02:51.870
and then you can email it to your students

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.912
or send it on your
learning management system

00:02:53.912 --> 00:02:56.940
or on a playlist of some kind

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:57.676
and then they can do it

00:02:57.676 --> 00:02:58.977
and if you sign up as a coach

00:02:58.977 --> 00:02:59.802
then you can track

00:02:59.802 --> 00:03:01.237
whether the students have worked on it.

00:03:01.237 --> 00:03:03.202
Also, you can assign it directly

00:03:03.202 --> 00:03:05.248
through the Khan Academy
interface on missions

00:03:05.248 --> 00:03:07.702
and there's other videos that
go into a lot of detail there.

00:03:07.702 --> 00:03:09.304
And so you can see this exercise,

00:03:09.304 --> 00:03:11.833
every student will get as
many exercises as they need.

00:03:11.833 --> 00:03:14.415
If they don't know how to tackle it,

00:03:14.415 --> 00:03:16.298
there are hints

00:03:16.298 --> 00:03:19.037
which are essentially
step by step solutions

00:03:19.037 --> 00:03:20.427
for that exercise

00:03:20.427 --> 00:03:22.676
and every one of these
Common Core exercises,

00:03:22.676 --> 00:03:25.181
these 150 thousand exercises,

00:03:25.181 --> 00:03:27.935
we have videos that were
also explicitly created

00:03:27.935 --> 00:03:30.346
for the Common Core associated with them.

00:03:30.346 --> 00:03:33.527
So here, Writing
expressions word problems.

00:03:33.527 --> 00:03:35.773
You can go into the library

00:03:35.773 --> 00:03:37.977
and you can see the video

00:03:37.977 --> 00:03:39.461
and this video in particular

00:03:39.461 --> 00:03:40.961
does some example problems

00:03:40.961 --> 00:03:43.174
from that Common Core exercise.

00:03:43.174 --> 00:03:45.088
So you'll have some videos

00:03:45.088 --> 00:03:47.554
that are more introductory.

00:03:47.554 --> 00:03:50.614
We also have articles
aligned with the Common Core

00:03:50.614 --> 00:03:53.352
that go deeper into it

00:03:53.352 --> 00:03:54.824
and these could actually be printed out

00:03:54.824 --> 00:03:56.081
and used as worksheets

00:03:56.081 --> 00:03:57.484
or the students can use it directly

00:03:57.484 --> 00:03:59.851
if they have access to
a computer or tablet

00:03:59.851 --> 00:04:01.076
or even on a phone.

00:04:01.076 --> 00:04:03.860
And of course, we have the actual,

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.477
we have the actual exercises here.

00:04:06.477 --> 00:04:08.266
So in general, I encourage you,

00:04:08.266 --> 00:04:10.568
let me go back to,

00:04:10.568 --> 00:04:12.973
let me go back to the map.

00:04:12.973 --> 00:04:14.864
Oh, it's actually right over here.

00:04:14.864 --> 00:04:17.469
I encourage you to go back.

00:04:17.469 --> 00:04:19.029
I encourage you to explore

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:22.296
our Common Core map on Khan Academy.

00:04:22.296 --> 00:04:24.423
As you can see, it is very comprehensive

00:04:24.423 --> 00:04:26.353
and as I said, it's done in conjunction

00:04:26.353 --> 00:04:29.909
with some of the creators
of the actual Common Core

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:30.970
and above and beyond that,

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.811
if you're a teacher who's
teaching the Common Core,

00:04:33.811 --> 00:04:35.814
there's a ton of other resources we have

00:04:35.814 --> 00:04:39.197
on just even understanding
what the standards speak to

00:04:39.197 --> 00:04:41.160
and how we can work together,

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.823
Khan Academy and you as a teacher,

00:04:42.823 --> 00:04:45.386
to make sure that the students
have good mastery of it.

00:04:45.386 --> 00:04:47.260
And all of that is actually encapsulated

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:48.451
as well in our missions

00:04:48.451 --> 00:04:50.006
and the missions are really valuable.

00:04:50.006 --> 00:04:53.030
You can use our library
and assign skill by skill

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:54.818
or video by video during the year

00:04:54.818 --> 00:04:56.216
but in parallel to that,

00:04:56.216 --> 00:04:58.380
our missions allow the
students to fill in their gaps,

00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:59.741
work at their own pace

00:04:59.741 --> 00:05:01.074
and usage of missions

00:05:01.074 --> 00:05:02.619
correlates with out performance

00:05:02.619 --> 00:05:04.773
on Common Core benchmark exams.

00:05:04.773 --> 00:05:07.868
So encourage you to explore all of this.

00:05:07.868 --> 00:05:09.640
We put a lot of work in this

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.255
and we'd love to hear your feedback

00:05:11.255 --> 00:05:13.817
on how we can make it better.
