JAN KLEINERT: Hey, welcome to
another episode of Apps Script

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:05.650
Office Hours.

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:07.190
I'm Jan Kleinert.

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:08.940
We have a new team member
here with us today.

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:09.700
This is Arun.

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.870
So he's joining us for
the first time.

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.820
And he's also a member of the
Apps Script Developer

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.920
Relations Team.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.300
So let's go ahead
and get started.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.550
First, before we jump into the
questions that we have in the

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.670
Moderator page, I wanted to
show you something in the

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:30.290
Chrome Web Store that
we added this week.

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:34.010
So I'm going to turn on
screen sharing here.

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:42.920
And show you this window.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.520
So we posted a Google Apps
Script app, which basically

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.440
will take you to
script.google.com, which is

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.950
the standalone script editor
in the Chrome Web Store

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.120
actually just yesterday,
I guess it was.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.130
So if you use Chrome and you
also use Apps Script a lot,

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.890
this would be a handy web
app for you to install.

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.090
What it will do is, you'll get
an icon for Apps Script on

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:06.080
your new tab page.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.116
It'll make it easy for you
to find it and launch it.

00:01:09.116 --> 00:01:11.260
So check it out.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.755
And again, it simply will take
you to script.google.com to

00:01:15.755 --> 00:01:18.880
the standalone script editor.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.770
So let me jump over to Google
Moderator here.

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.850
So we have four or
five questions.

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.280
And we'll just work
through them here.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.000
And then once we're done with
that, I'll jump back to the

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.370
Hangout, and we can take any
live questions that we have.

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.450
So the first one here, let me
refresh to make sure that we

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.020
have the most up to date.

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.180
OK.

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.930
So "is there a time frame for
adding the rest of the UI app

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.595
widgets to the GUI builder?

00:01:44.595 --> 00:01:47.430
Thanks for addressing my
question on September 6.

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.820
Sorry I missed the live Hangout
by a few minutes."

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.640
Said I'd look into it and
provide feedback.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:52.180
So that's right.

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:53.180
I did.

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.070
And I don't have concrete
feedback yet.

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:02.560
One question I got in response
was, which specific widgets

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.270
would be most useful to you?

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.000
Are there certain ones, like a
small subset of ones that you

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.470
are looking for specifically
to be in GUI builder?

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.430
Or do you really just want
everything that's available in

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.780
UI app to be there in
the GUI builder?

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.050
Knowing specific ones that would
be the most valuable

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.290
will help us prioritize.

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.110
But again, I don't have any
concrete information on

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.360
when/if we'll be adding all the
UI apps to the GUI builder

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.970
at this time.

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.830
But I will continue to check
on that, and I'll

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.446
update if we have more.

00:02:32.446 --> 00:02:34.230
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Are you sharing
the screen still?

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.640
JAN KLEINERT: I am, yes.

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.800
So yes, hopefully everybody
can see this.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.290
And the link to the Moderator
questions is also available

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:43.920
from the Google Developers--

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.500
sorry,
developers.google.com/live

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.370
from the entry there.

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.830
It should be embedded
in the page.

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:52.340
Second question is
on triggers.

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.790
So "I keep running into
situations where I wish I

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.110
could immediately trigger a
script, maybe by SMS or on

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.910
receipt of an email.

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.175
One minute triggers won't
work for this use case.

00:03:01.175 --> 00:03:04.440
Is there a workaround, or does
Google plan on providing a

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.550
live event trigger or even
a post trigger?"

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.960
So this is a really
good question.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.820
For those of you who aren't
familiar with triggers,

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.620
triggers are basically a way
to execute an Apps Script

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.560
function after some sort
of event happens.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.430
So it could be a time-based
trigger, where you have this

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:23.780
trigger run every
five minutes.

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.730
So that would be a clock-based
event.

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.870
Or in the case of Google
Spreadsheets, we do have some

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.300
of these event-based triggers.

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:34.560
So when a Google Spreadsheets
form is submitted or when a

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.320
spreadsheet is opened or when
a spreadsheet is edited, it

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.620
can fire off an event as well.

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.400
Outside of Google Spreadsheets,
we don't

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.700
currently have product-based
event triggers.

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.120
But it sounds like
that is something

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.390
that this poster wants.

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:57.070
So what would be really helpful
here is in the issue

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.800
tracker to raise a feature
request for us with the

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.440
specific types of event
triggers that

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:03.080
you're looking for.

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:07.890
What are the ones that would
help you be able to do the use

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:12.060
cases that you can't
currently do today?

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.630
We are looking into the
possibility of adding

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:15.890
additional event triggers.

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:20.790
But I don't have specifics on
which ones, when, that sort of

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:21.380
thing right now.

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.040
But it's always helpful for us
to know what it is that you

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.670
want the most.

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:29.782
So do let us now in the issue
tracker for that.

00:04:29.782 --> 00:04:33.950
OK, the third one here--
"display of data in a UI." And

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:34.750
I'm assuming--

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.560
it looks like this is a question
related to UI App.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:42.730
So it's not a problem for data
with multiple records at once.

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:44.900
So you can use a grid or
FlexTable for that.

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.250
But "how to display data where
you only want to see one

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:51.620
record at a time with buttons
for next, back, first, last to

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.250
click through the records?"

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.690
Well, off the top of my head, I
don't think we have a built

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:58.300
in UI app widget that will
do this for you.

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.810
I can visualize in my head what
you're talking about.

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:02.060
It's the kind of--

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.860
almost like a record in a
database viewer kind of thing.

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.370
I don't think there's
a built-in one

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:11.580
supported by UI App.

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.670
So I think if you wanted
something like this, you would

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:15.730
probably have to build
it yourself.

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:18.310
So you could have a panel
in the center that

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:19.830
would pull in the--

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:22.320
a panel with labels, maybe, that
would pull in the data

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.860
that you want to display for
each individual record.

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:26.990
And then you could
hook up buttons.

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:29.340
So you could hook up a button
for next that calls a

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:32.390
function, that loads the next
record and refreshes the panel

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.910
and the data.

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:35.770
And the same thing for back
and first and last.

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:38.500
So we don't have something out
of the box, I don't think,

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:39.390
that will do this for you.

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:44.820
But you could build something
that would do that.

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:45.370
Let's see.

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:47.050
And I'm just going to jump over
and make sure we're not

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:50.250
getting any follow-ups
in the chat window.

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:52.730
Looks like we're not.

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:55.820
So "for a spreadsheet cell, what
is the best way to test

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:59.270
if the value is a hyperlink?" So
I went ahead and put a link

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:01.050
in the response here.

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:03.620
If I'm understanding the
question correctly, you have a

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:07.320
spreadsheet where some of the
cell values may be hyperlinks.

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.880
And you want to be able to
determine which ones and then

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:11.710
do something based on that.

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:13.680
So from your script, you
could pull in the

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.420
values of the cells.

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:19.810
And then what I think would
probably be the simplest would

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:23.460
be to basically run a regular
expression, run a matcher

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:29.220
against that, and determine if
the value in that cell matches

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:31.310
a URL format.

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:33.700
It's actually kind of tricky
to build a good regular

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:35.620
expression for validating
URLs.

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:38.710
But here's an article I just ran
across that had some tips

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:43.690
for, depending on how complete
and how fancy you want to get,

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:46.940
some different ways
to build URL

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:48.590
regular expression matchers.

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:51.790
So hopefully that's helpful.

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:54.040
And then this last question
here. "Is there an easy to

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:58.180
access the Google Drive API,
not the Doc list default

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:03.690
services from App Script?" OK,
so "URL fetch OAuth config

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:12.530
doesn't work because Drive API
requires OAuth2." And I think

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:16.860
we may have Yan on the
live Hangout here.

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:21.050
So related to that, is this
the Drive SDK that you're

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:22.010
looking for?

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:26.260
So this is the API for actually
integrating a web app

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:29.710
with Google Drive.

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:32.710
If you can hear me and you're
there, you can type into the

00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:35.850
chat window if you--

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:36.340
here we go.

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:38.700
We've got some typing
going on.

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:39.770
So more or less, yes.

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:44.290
So if it requires OAuth2, too
and I think you're correct

00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:48.800
that our current OAuth support
is not supporting OAuth2 yet,

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:52.060
that may not be possible
at this time.

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:54.430
I will go back and check with
the team to see if there's a

00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:56.210
workaround for that.

00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:59.830
But I think that if they only
support OAuth2, it may not be

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:02.620
possible yet.

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:05.480
So I will verify that
and let you know.

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:09.700
I'll update this Moderator entry
so that you can have a

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:12.520
solid answer.

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:17.050
We do know that there are lots
of use cases out there where

00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:18.290
we need OAuth2 support.

00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:20.790
So that something that's on
our road map that we're

00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:21.490
working towards.

00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:24.476
But we don't have the OAuth2
support in Apps Script yet.

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:31.730
Any other questions from
our live Hangout

00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:32.980
participants today?

00:08:35.386 --> 00:08:37.760
Turn off screensharing
for now.

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:44.090
No questions?

00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:48.410
OK.

00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:50.010
Well, our usual--
oh, here we go.

00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:52.040
We have--

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:56.870
so Yan is talking about
the API from

00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:58.380
developers.google.com/drive.

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:01.890
Let me just click over and take
a quick look at that.

00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:10.850
Yeah, so that is right.

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:14.720
That is the Drive SDK.

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:17.120
And I don't believe it's
possible to interact with that

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:19.630
from Apps Script today.

00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:21.210
We have been getting
requests for it.

00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:23.830
So I'll follow up with the
team and find out what's

00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:26.210
required basically on our side
to make that possible from

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:27.150
within Apps Script.

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:31.366
And I'll update on the
issue tracker.

00:09:31.366 --> 00:09:33.250
But yeah, hopefully, that's at
least helpful to know you're

00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:34.320
not doing it wrong.

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:35.750
It's just not supported yet.

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:42.520
So I was going to mention Eric
and Ikai, who are often here

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:45.350
for Office Hours, are in Austin,
Texas today because

00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:47.310
we're having an Apps Script
hackathon there.

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:51.030
So I'm hoping that next week,
we'll have some exciting apps

00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:53.450
and scripts to tell you about
that were built at the

00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:57.460
hackathon, once we hear
how all of that went.

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:07.820
So here's a question from one
of our Hangout attendees.

00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:12.030
So "can the content service do
OAuth authentication?" So I

00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:14.370
was speaking with somebody else
about this last week.

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:20.300
So do you mean kind of like
inbound OAuth so that

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:24.290
basically you can use this as
a web service, basically?

00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:29.876
And for those of you who
aren't familiar with--

00:10:29.876 --> 00:10:32.980
yeah, who aren't familiar with
content service, it allows you

00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:37.350
to serve up text formatted--

00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:40.690
so instead of using UI App
or HTML service to serve

00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:44.430
web-based content, it can
serve up like RSS, JSON,

00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:46.350
things like that.

00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:52.410
And so no, today it's not
possible to support OAuth.

00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:59.320
So, for example, if you wanted
to have it accessing data of

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:04.030
some-- maybe Twitter's API or
something like that, we don't

00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:08.100
support that OAuth flow for
content service yet today.

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:09.990
But we know there's
a need for it.

00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:12.070
Our engineering team is aware.

00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:13.970
And they're looking into
possibilities for the easiest

00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:16.660
way to support that.

00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:18.510
So I believe there is
a feature request in

00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:19.510
the tracker for that.

00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:21.160
If there's not, go ahead
and add one in.

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:22.580
And I'll hook it up
with our kind of

00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:25.120
internal tracking process.

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:30.862
So that we can keep you aware
of the progress on that.

00:11:30.862 --> 00:11:33.210
OK.

00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:34.955
And any other questions?

00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:41.700
I am looking forward to when
we have that available for

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:42.450
content service.

00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:44.570
Because there's a lot of really
cool things that you

00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:46.240
can do once we have
support for that.

00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:54.560
OK.

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:56.520
Let me go just check back
on the Moderator

00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:57.985
page one more time.

00:11:57.985 --> 00:11:59.861
See if anything new came in.

00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:03.940
Nope.

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:08.740
Well, in that case, we
may have a very short

00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:11.700
Office Hours today.

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:12.510
I won't--

00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:14.320
MALE SPEAKER: Well, I could
throw a question in, Jan.

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:17.462
JAN KLEINERT: OK, sure.

00:12:17.462 --> 00:12:18.446
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah?

00:12:18.446 --> 00:12:18.940
JAN KLEINERT: Yeah, go ahead.

00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:23.280
MALE SPEAKER: So I published
a [AUDIO LOST].

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:25.910
One of the things that I've
noticed is once I installed it

00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:28.900
in the Chrome Web Store,
is the icon that

00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:30.705
came is the Apps icon.

00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:36.880
Is there a [AUDIO LOST]

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:38.760
that published to the
Chrome Web Store can

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:40.240
customize that icon?

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:41.430
JAN KLEINERT: Yes.

00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:45.820
So that is something that we're
currently working on.

00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:48.750
The support for that is
pretty limited today.

00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:52.550
There is a complex way that
I can follow up with.

00:12:56.090 --> 00:12:56.920
It's complicated.

00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:59.830
There's a complicated way you
can kind of get the manifesto.

00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:01.750
So what we're trying to do with
the Chrome Web Store is

00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:03.870
make it simple for you so that
you don't have to build the

00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:06.290
manifest file and the zip
package that you have to

00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:06.990
upload to the Chrome
Web Store.

00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:11.750
However, we didn't at launch
support a way to customize the

00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:13.630
icon that gets installed
on the new tab page.

00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:16.300
And that's I think the
issue that you had.

00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:17.820
Because yes, it's obviously
a better--

00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:18.580
MALE SPEAKER: Yep.

00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:21.250
JAN KLEINERT: --experience if
you can have the proper

00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:24.010
branding for your app with
your own icon there.

00:13:24.010 --> 00:13:28.350
So that is something we are
definitely planning to add.

00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:32.040
But in the meantime, I can
explain a workaround, a way

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:38.590
for you to kind of get that
manifest file and the assets

00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:40.870
that you need to then repackage
the zip file and

00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:43.050
upload to your Chrome
Web Store listing in

00:13:43.050 --> 00:13:45.420
the developer dashboard.

00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:48.060
So I'm trying to think where
is the best place for me to

00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:48.790
put this information.

00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:50.550
Maybe what I'll do is I'll
post something to the

00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:52.890
Moderator page later
with instructions

00:13:52.890 --> 00:13:54.165
on how to do that.

00:13:54.165 --> 00:13:54.900
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:56.226
JAN KLEINERT: OK?

00:13:56.226 --> 00:13:56.670
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:58.280
Or do you want me to--

00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:01.690
or would you rather a Stack
Overflow question?

00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:02.660
JAN KLEINERT: Either
way is fine.

00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:07.590
I'm going to just put it on the
Moderator page since it's

00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:11.330
within the context of this
Office Hours today.

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:12.906
And it's messy.

00:14:12.906 --> 00:14:17.405
So until we have the proper
support built in, I'll just

00:14:17.405 --> 00:14:18.010
explain it here.

00:14:18.010 --> 00:14:20.540
And it will hopefully give
you what you need,

00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:25.318
but not be too complex.

00:14:25.318 --> 00:14:27.300
MALE SPEAKER: Oh, OK.

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:30.197
And I guess one of the other
questions that I've noticed

00:14:30.197 --> 00:14:32.590
[AUDIO LOST]

00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:34.520
and getting some really
interesting things

00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:37.320
happening with that.

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:39.370
I saw in the issue tracker,
I just wondered is there--

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:46.710
is it [AUDIO LOST]

00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:49.640
or is it just sort of thing--

00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:52.620
what I did, for example, I wrote
just a simple little

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:55.850
script account of all
the [AUDIO LOST]

00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:56.690
in there.

00:14:56.690 --> 00:15:00.250
And sometimes it would come back
with four and come back

00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:04.860
with 55 where I knew there were
55 objects in the store.

00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:08.150
And I thought refreshing my
browser, doing that sort of

00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:09.670
thing, didn't seem to fix it.

00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:11.070
But I would log out,
come back later.

00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:15.540
And it would [AUDIO LOST]

00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:17.670
times.

00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:23.060
My impression was, because the
object sort of came back, that

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:27.640
it was the integrity or some
sort of connection issue.

00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:29.181
Do you have any--

00:15:29.181 --> 00:15:30.600
JAN KLEINERT: Any
updates on it?

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:31.240
So yes.

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:32.966
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah,
any updates or--

00:15:32.966 --> 00:15:33.840
JAN KLEINERT: Yeah.

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:35.840
And the audio was kind
of going in and out.

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:39.460
I think I got the gist of
what you were saying.

00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:41.770
I'm going to kind of repeat
it back to make sure.

00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:45.290
So there is a script DB issue
happening right now.

00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:47.620
It doesn't seem to be happening
in all cases.

00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:50.810
But what you're experiencing,
where you know there's X

00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:53.180
number of items in the database,
but when you do a

00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:55.560
query, you're getting Y back.

00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:59.230
And even that may not be
consistent from, for example,

00:15:59.230 --> 00:16:03.290
if you access the web app from
the dev URL versus the

00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:04.540
published version URL.

00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:09.130
The engineers are working
hard to figure this

00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:10.380
one out right now.

00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:15.100
It seems to be--

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:18.760
I don't want to speculate too
much, but it's not that the

00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:19.650
data is not there.

00:16:19.650 --> 00:16:22.350
You're just getting inconsistent
views of the data

00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:24.960
in certain cases.

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:26.570
And we're working
really hard to--

00:16:26.570 --> 00:16:27.980
MALE SPEAKER: That's
my impression.

00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:28.650
JAN KLEINERT: Yes.

00:16:28.650 --> 00:16:32.740
Because it's obviously not how
it's supposed to be working.

00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:35.110
So that is a serious
bug that they're

00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:36.560
looking into right now.

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:39.080
And we hope to have a solution
for that soon.

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:42.030
As soon as we do, I'll update
the issue tracker

00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:43.120
and let you all know.

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:45.100
But we can definitely reproduce
it, and the

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:46.200
engineers are on it.

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:47.740
I was talking to them about
it this morning.

00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:51.285
So they're trying to fix
it as soon as possible.

00:16:58.510 --> 00:17:01.340
Any other questions?

00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:02.300
Comments?

00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:03.550
Things you want to talk about?

00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:09.140
OK.

00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:11.460
Well, in that case, thank
you all for attending.

00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:14.069
And I think we'll just go
ahead and wrap up early.

00:17:14.069 --> 00:17:18.839
And we'll see you hopefully
next week.

00:17:18.839 --> 00:17:18.880
All right.

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:20.209
Thank you, everybody.

00:17:20.209 --> 00:17:21.459
Bye.
