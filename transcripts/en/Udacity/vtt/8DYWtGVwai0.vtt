00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.880
You can add jQuery to any website using script tags, like so.

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:09.250
You can host this file on your own server with a path like this one,

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:12.960
but it's actually recommended to use a version of jQuery hosted on

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.290
a content delivery network or CDN.

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.700
CDNs are usually much faster than your own server,

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.290
plus it allows you to take advantage of the browser's caching feature.

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:26.480
jQuery and Google both host jQuery.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.270
Given the sheer number of websites using jQuery, you're definitely safe using

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.095
either Google or jQuery's official host to host for your production builds.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.050
And don't forget to use the minified version of jQuery in production.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.260
The minified version of jQuery is considerably smaller, so

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:43.940
it's going to lead to faster page loads.
