important you know global topic so i
think that i think that's where that

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:00.570
think that i think that's where that
 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:07.040
think that i think that's where that
needs to go and i think if i was to pick

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.050
needs to go and i think if i was to pick
 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.550
needs to go and i think if i was to pick
out maybe one other kind of weak signal

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.560

out maybe one other kind of weak signal
um i think it would i think it would

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.280
um i think it would i think it would
 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.260
um i think it would i think it would
most certainly be the incorporation of

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:18.270
most certainly be the incorporation of
 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:29.780
most certainly be the incorporation of
science into larger or more obviously

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:29.790
science into larger or more obviously
 

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:36.980
science into larger or more obviously
large ministries and sort of decisions

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:36.990
large ministries and sort of decisions
 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:40.600
large ministries and sort of decisions
that need to be made by leaders as

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:40.610
that need to be made by leaders as
 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:45.730
that need to be made by leaders as
happening out with regularity and

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:45.740
 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:48.860
science is a cornerstone of the agenda

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:48.870
science is a cornerstone of the agenda
 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:54.620
science is a cornerstone of the agenda
the World Economic Forum now leaders see

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:54.630
the World Economic Forum now leaders see
 

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:56.420
the World Economic Forum now leaders see
their science advisors and science

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:56.430
their science advisors and science
 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:02.270
their science advisors and science
ministers as important and as having a

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:02.280
ministers as important and as having a
 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.090
ministers as important and as having a
relationship with national security and

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:05.100
relationship with national security and
 

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:09.170
relationship with national security and
economic policy and so forth and so I

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:09.180
economic policy and so forth and so I
 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:13.960
economic policy and so forth and so I
think that the incorporation of science

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:13.970
think that the incorporation of science
 

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:17.060
think that the incorporation of science
into the decision-making apparatus of

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:17.070
into the decision-making apparatus of
 

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:22.700
into the decision-making apparatus of
leaders globally is taking place in very

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:22.710
leaders globally is taking place in very
 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:24.440
leaders globally is taking place in very
many parts of the world in very

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:24.450
many parts of the world in very
 

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:26.900
many parts of the world in very
different ways but it's sort of an

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:26.910
different ways but it's sort of an
 

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:32.300
different ways but it's sort of an
important weak signal I think right

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:32.310
 

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:34.370
