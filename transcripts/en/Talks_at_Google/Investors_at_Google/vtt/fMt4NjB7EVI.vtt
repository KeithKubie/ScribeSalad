00:00:01.382 --> 00:00:02.215
MALE SPEAKER: Hello.

00:00:02.215 --> 00:00:03.800
And welcome, everyone.

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.560
Today we have with
us Donald Yacktman.

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.350
Mr. Donald Yacktman is a
partner and portfolio manager

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:11.940
of Yacktman Asset Management.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.610
Several milestones in his
long investing journey

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.820
have been featured
in prominent media.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.520
Don started Yacktman,
founding the company

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.320
as its president,
portfolio manager,

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.050
and chief investment officer.

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:28.610
Since the founding
of the company,

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.470
Don has been awarded the 1994
Portfolio Manager of the Year

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:34.070
award by Mutual Fund Letter.

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.740
Don has also been
nominated by Morningstar

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:40.410
as Fund Manager of
the Decade in 2009

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.910
and finalist for
Morningstar's Domestic-Stock

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.030
Manager of the
Year award in 2011,

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.990
as well as the Portfolio Manager
of the Year award in 1991.

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:53.432
Don holds an MBA with
distinction from Harvard.

00:00:53.432 --> 00:00:57.040
In a recent interview about
his investing philosophy,

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.980
Don described his process of
buying above-average businesses

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.830
at below-average prices.

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.760
He compared these
businesses to a beach ball

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.800
being pushed under the water.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.730
Eventually the key is to wait
long enough for this process

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:17.040
to occur where they
rise to the top.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.570
In speaking with Don-- we met
just shortly before the talk--

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.850
and learning about
his experiences,

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.230
I think there's a lot to Don,
more than just investing,

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:32.250
and to learn from
his rich experiences.

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.350
So we are very delighted to
have Don in person with us

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.720
today to share more
about his investing

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.730
and personal philosophy.

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.200
So without any further
ado, ladies and gentlemen,

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.549
please join me in
welcoming Donald Yacktman.

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.045
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:46.545 --> 00:01:49.010
DONALD YACKTMAN: Thank you.

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.510
Thanks.

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.729
It's good to be with you today.

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:53.770
I think about the only
thing that wasn't included

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.780
is that I'm a Cubs fan.

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:56.810
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:58.116 --> 00:01:59.490
As you know, the
Cubs haven't won

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.060
the World Series since 1908.

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.580
So we have a phrase,
and that is that anybody

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:06.900
can have a bad century.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.340
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.100
That reminds me, some
of my kids probably

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.450
think I was at that
World Series in 1908.

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:16.440
I really wasn't.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.800
I just want to make that clear.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.133
In fact, I wasn't even at the
last time they went there,

00:02:20.133 --> 00:02:22.060
which was 1945.

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.850
But I am reminded of these
two elderly gentleman who

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.100
were chatting with each other.

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.170
And one of them said
to the other one,

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.310
he said, my memory
is starting to go.

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.190
And the other one said, he
said, I had that problem too.

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.265
He said, but I went to the
doc and he gave me some meds.

00:02:38.265 --> 00:02:41.470
And he says they really
seem to be working.

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:46.120
He said, I just can't
remember the name of the meds.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:53.360
Thorns, flowers, bushes, red
and yellow and white and pink.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.127
And the other guy looked
at him and he said, rose.

00:02:56.127 --> 00:02:57.710
He said, [SNAPPING FINGERS]
that's it.

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:59.680
Rose, what's the name
of that medicine?

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.130
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.640
So I haven't quite
hit that point yet.

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.810
Today I thought I'd talk
a little bit about some

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.340
of my background and how
I got into the investment

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.740
field and a little
bit about my history

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:19.456
before we go through
the process and so on.

00:03:19.456 --> 00:03:20.830
I haven't done
that before, but I

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:22.496
thought it might be
kind of interesting.

00:03:22.496 --> 00:03:25.840
And I know there was
some interest in that.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.930
Both of my parents came
out of poverty situations.

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.250
And my father's
side, my grandfather

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:35.970
left the scene
before he was five.

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.870
He ended up going back to
Poland for a couple of years,

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.720
about five years lived in
dirt floors, straw bed.

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.840
So he came pretty poverished.

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.060
My mother's father
passed away with a stroke

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.500
or cerebral hemorrhage
when she was nine.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:59.110
And so she also didn't
have a father in the home.

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.870
By the time I was born, my
father was an entrepreneur

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.240
and had been pretty successful
even though neither my mother

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:11.760
nor my father went to post high
school really, very little.

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.460
My mother managed the office.

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:16.940
And so they were
both hard chargers,

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.870
if you will, and worked hard
and I think set a good example

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.570
in a lot of ways.

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.980
They divorced, unfortunately,
when I was eight.

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:32.700
I moved out to Salt Lake
City and grew up there.

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:36.880
And I know this is probably
not politically correct,

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.350
but when I was 15, I
joined the Mormon church.

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.990
And in my mind, that was the
best decision I've ever made.

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:47.420
And a lot of people say,
well, how can that be?

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:49.740
What about your wife
and your decision?

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.980
And I said, well,
you got to remember

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:56.320
that wouldn't have had happened
had the first one not happened.

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.200
By the way, my wife and I just
celebrated our 50th anniversary

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:01.850
last month.

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:05.250
She and I were born in the
same hospital in Chicago

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:06.230
nine days apart.

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:09.670
And in those days women
were in for 10 days.

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:13.120
So I kid her about the wink
she gave me in the nursery.

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:13.620
But anyway--

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:14.811
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:17.990
One of the other things
that becomes important

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:20.180
and why that comment
of mine is relevant

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.060
is when I was 19
I'd just finished

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.120
my first year of college.

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:29.580
And in that period of
time-- that was 1960--

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.140
the Russians had
sent up Sputnik.

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:35.760
And so anybody who was
good in math and science

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:38.660
was really encouraged
to go into engineering.

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:41.310
And that's what I thought
would be my field.

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:44.870
But that summer-- in
our church, young men

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:48.260
are given the opportunity to
serve missions for two years,

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.940
go out and do missionary work.

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:53.580
And they changed the
age from 20 to 19,

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:55.430
which meant that I could go.

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:57.160
And so I did right away.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.100
And after two years of
being on that mission,

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:03.060
I really came back with a
totally different feeling

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:06.020
about what I wanted
to do career-wise

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:08.650
and really felt I wanted
to work more with people.

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:09.880
Not that engineers don't.

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:13.220
I mean, I realize a lot of
you probably are engineers

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:14.810
and work with
people all the time.

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:18.230
But it just-- in other words,
it was a different look

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:20.940
that I had of the
world, if you will.

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:23.570
And I went back and I
looked at an interest exam

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:27.260
that I'd had when I
finished high school.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.170
And in that interest
exam I found out

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:33.850
that I was only about a 32
percentile in engineering,

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:37.820
but I was like a 92
percentile in business.

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:41.330
And I thought, maybe
there's a message here.

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:44.330
So I remember I thought,
well, this MBA sounds

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:46.200
like I ought to get that MBA.

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:47.409
That sounds like a good idea.

00:06:47.409 --> 00:06:49.658
And so I went to some of the
counselors and they said,

00:06:49.658 --> 00:06:51.750
well, don't get a business
undergraduate degree.

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:58.720
They want you to have more
rounded career education.

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:01.140
So I thought, well, I'll go
to the nearest thing, which

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:04.090
was economics, I thought.

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:09.440
And so I majored in economics
in my undergraduate work

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:10.807
and then went on and got an MBA.

00:07:10.807 --> 00:07:12.390
By the way, I don't
know if any of you

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:15.224
know what the definition
of an economist is.

00:07:15.224 --> 00:07:16.140
You know what that is?

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:18.136
That's an accountant
without a personality.

00:07:18.136 --> 00:07:19.506
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:26.490
Anyway, so I got
my MBA, and then

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:29.390
had been basically
pretty much working

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:35.070
in this business throughout
my career and over the years

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:39.350
have kind of developed a
style that I feel very, very

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:41.020
comfortable with.

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:45.560
We've been very fortunate,
not only on the business side,

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:46.760
but on the personal side.

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:47.870
We have seven children.

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:51.000
We have 22 grandchildren.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.200
And that's quite a brood.

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:55.834
And we like to have them over on
Sundays a couple times a month

00:07:55.834 --> 00:07:56.875
and have dinner together.

00:07:56.875 --> 00:07:59.260
And it gets a little
hectic and a little noisy,

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:00.569
but it's enjoyable.

00:08:00.569 --> 00:08:02.610
Anyway, that's a little
bit of the personal side.

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:08.220
So one of the things
that I thought I'd do

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:11.000
is go through the
process with you.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.370
As was already mentioned,
this is one of the quotes

00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:17.930
that people-- my kids tease
me, by the way, on what they

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:21.090
call my dad-isms,
or my little quips.

00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:22.170
And this is one of them.

00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:24.500
We like to buy beach balls
being pushed underwater

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:26.700
with the water level rising.

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:29.060
I think to me-- I'm
a conceptual thinker.

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:30.840
I like to create
mental pictures.

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:35.250
And I think that tends to
help us understand the process

00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:37.422
of investing a lot easier.

00:08:37.422 --> 00:08:38.880
The next thing I
want to do is talk

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:41.320
a little bit about
investment goals, which

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:43.640
leads up to the process.

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:47.860
I wish I could tell you that
over the last roughly almost

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:52.710
50 years now investing
that I did everything

00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:54.470
in a great orderly fashion.

00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:57.490
It just doesn't work that way.

00:08:57.490 --> 00:09:00.540
We tend to meander our way,
I think, a lot of times

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:01.110
through life.

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:03.130
I've told the younger
guys, hopefully, I've

00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:08.630
saved you 10 or 15 years of
wandering in the wilderness,

00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:11.890
if you will.

00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:16.760
But, again, this is where I've
ended up with in the process.

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:18.990
And let's talk a little
bit about these goals.

00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:21.840
The first goal is to
protect client's money.

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:24.430
We feel that's really,
really important.

00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:26.750
And there are two things,
though, that are important,

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:30.030
and they kind of counterbalance
each other a little bit.

00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:32.355
One is protect against
making dumb decisions.

00:09:32.355 --> 00:09:35.110
In other words, losing
the money permanently.

00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:37.740
Any time you're
investing in securities,

00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:41.000
there's a degree of fluctuation.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.790
Most big companies,
by the way, if you

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:47.260
look at their 52-week ranges,
fluctuate as much as 50%

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.720
from low to high over
a 12-month period.

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:51.950
You'd be surprised.

00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:57.020
So what we don't want to do is
permanently lose the capital.

00:09:57.020 --> 00:10:00.010
The second thing, though, and
that's-- you could, in effect,

00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:03.520
say, well, I could stick it
under a mattress and do that.

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:06.960
But you really can't in a world
where you have paper money.

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:08.960
And that means inflation.

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:11.180
If you look at the
last roughly 100 years,

00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:13.960
it's averaged about 3% a year.

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:16.180
Now just to give
you an idea, that

00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:19.770
will take $1 to a nickel
over 100-year period.

00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:23.420
Over other periods of
time, it'll be different.

00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:26.360
We've had as much as
4% over long periods

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:27.350
of time in inflation.

00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:29.690
So I don't know what
it'll be in the future,

00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:31.290
but I know it's inevitable.

00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:32.420
That's the bottom line.

00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:33.680
It is inevitable.

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:36.760
And so in order to
protect capital,

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:40.800
we need to be proactive
and invest it.

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:42.800
And if you look at
the numbers, they're

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:46.070
pretty clear that equity
investing provides

00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:47.750
the higher rates of return.

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:50.200
Now you could say backdoor
equities, like junk bonds

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:51.950
or something like that,
but they're really

00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:53.750
equities in disguise.

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:57.780
So equities, bonds, cash,
you've seen the numbers

00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:01.820
over the years, I'm
sure, and they're there.

00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:05.050
So the other side is
to grow the money.

00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:07.670
And growing the money, we
want to get equity returns,

00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:10.480
so we want double digit returns.

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:12.740
But the other
thing we want to do

00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:15.930
is measure ourselves
over a period of time

00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:17.700
that's appropriate.

00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:19.650
And we feel a real
way to measure

00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:23.100
yourself is over a
very long time frame,

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:26.920
or from one market peak
to the next market peak.

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:30.850
That's the toughest time period,
I think, to evaluate managers.

00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:34.555
And the problem is is sometimes
you have these very long time

00:11:34.555 --> 00:11:38.020
frames in order to do that.

00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:40.510
But when you do that, I think
you really get a better look.

00:11:40.510 --> 00:11:43.440
Unfortunately, they don't work
out at a nice calendar year

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:45.250
type events.

00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:48.950
But I still think that's
the best way to look at it.

00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:54.890
So with that in mind,
how do you invest money?

00:11:54.890 --> 00:11:58.300
And we're going to talk about
each one of these three things

00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:00.890
in the investment strategy.

00:12:00.890 --> 00:12:05.190
First one we'll take
is good business.

00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:07.700
And several years ago
I thought about this

00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:12.300
and thought that there was
really a way to look at maybe

00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:19.770
create a grid and then
position every company

00:12:19.770 --> 00:12:23.691
on this grid or the components
that make up a company so

00:12:23.691 --> 00:12:25.940
that one could really get
an idea of what the business

00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:27.430
model was all about.

00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:28.860
Because, ultimately,
this business

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:32.150
boils down to what you buy
and what you pay for it.

00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:35.210
So the business model
is very, very important.

00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:37.670
And in analyzing
the business model,

00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:40.630
you'll notice that there are
certain things that make sense

00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:42.120
to us.

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:45.140
And what we're looking for--
businesses that have what

00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:49.090
I call high ROTAs--
return on tangible assets.

00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:52.970
And as an example,
we put in here--

00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:56.810
or I put in here-- four
different categories.

00:12:56.810 --> 00:13:00.530
And that category, the one that
hits the jackpot, if you will,

00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:02.120
are the consumer staples.

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:04.100
If you think about
it, these kind

00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:07.140
of businesses,
where they can have

00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:11.230
a product or a service that's
relatively disposable and low

00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:14.440
price so it's used
up on a regular basis

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:19.340
has an edge because they can
manage their capital much more

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:20.440
efficiently.

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:23.730
They can keep it
working all the time.

00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:27.040
And so when you can keep the
capital working all the time,

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:30.090
and particularly if you
have a high market share,

00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:32.950
you can make a lot of money.

00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:36.220
A company that has a
40% share of the market

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:39.210
doesn't make twice what a
company has a 20% share of,

00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:41.730
they'll make four times as much.

00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:46.680
So having a big market share
is also important as well as

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:48.120
having a low-cost position.

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:51.340
But they all start to come
together if you think about.

00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:53.115
All those things start
to work together.

00:13:56.590 --> 00:14:00.040
Years ago-- before the meeting,
I was talking a little bit.

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:04.020
And I started talking about
comparing two businesses that

00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:07.210
were basically no growth
businesses for decades--

00:14:07.210 --> 00:14:11.470
the automobile business
and the cigarette business.

00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:14.180
And Phillip Morris
and General Motors--

00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:16.250
But if you look at
the business models,

00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:18.420
they're night and
day different even

00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:21.130
though they're both in
virtually no growth business.

00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:23.520
And so as a result of
that, Philip Morris

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:25.360
has been a spectacular
investment.

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:28.030
General Motors went bankrupt.

00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:30.230
So over a long
period of time, you

00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:32.250
start to see the impact of this.

00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:35.400
I guess the ultimate
is the fellow who

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:38.330
went to his 25th class reunion
for the Harvard Business

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:39.350
School.

00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:42.400
And he walked in
and he said, Joe, we

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:44.060
haven't seen you for 25 years.

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:46.150
Where have you been?

00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:50.210
And he said, well, he
said, I barely got in here.

00:14:50.210 --> 00:14:54.485
He said, I had to work and
work and work just to graduate.

00:14:54.485 --> 00:14:56.050
And he said, so
I knew I couldn't

00:14:56.050 --> 00:14:59.260
compete with you guys and
your fancy jobs in consulting

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:01.910
and finance in
Boston and New York.

00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:04.620
He said, I went back to
a little town in Illinois

00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:06.450
that I came from.

00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:09.040
He says, but we did
develop this little product

00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:11.200
and we did patent it.

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:15.110
And he said, you guys
probably use it every day.

00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:20.340
He said, we make it for
$1 and we sell it for $4.

00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:24.500
I said you'd be amazed
how that 3% adds up.

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:26.870
Now he may not have
got the math right,

00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:28.474
but he got the concept right.

00:15:28.474 --> 00:15:29.896
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:34.090
That's a good business when
you can have that situation.

00:15:34.090 --> 00:15:38.550
Contrast that to businesses that
are over here in the capital

00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:40.340
goods area.

00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:43.320
Not that there aren't some
businesses that have done well.

00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:46.330
But I was thinking the other
day, John Deere, for instance,

00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:47.410
is an example.

00:15:47.410 --> 00:15:50.170
Many years ago when I was
looking at the tractor

00:15:50.170 --> 00:15:57.060
business, I think the life
cycle is 17 years for tractors.

00:15:57.060 --> 00:15:58.670
How would you like
to be in a business

00:15:58.670 --> 00:16:02.820
where somebody bought your
product every 17 years?

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:03.570
OK.

00:16:03.570 --> 00:16:08.490
Think about that versus
somebody who makes toothpaste.

00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:08.990
OK.

00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:11.980
It's a lot different situation.

00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:13.640
The airline business,
a lot of people

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:16.000
have talked about how bad
the airline business is

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.390
and how it hasn't made any
money since the Kitty Hawk.

00:16:19.390 --> 00:16:24.220
I think at one time
the airline business,

00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:28.000
it took $1 of capital to
generate $0.40 of revenue.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.450
That's just not a good business.

00:16:29.450 --> 00:16:30.890
OK.

00:16:30.890 --> 00:16:32.970
But, again, it's a
matter of looking

00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:38.240
at the total composition
of the business in my mind.

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:40.990
In other words, one really needs
to understand what they own.

00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:42.120
What kind of business?

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:45.540
Is this the kind of
business that makes sense?

00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:47.890
Is it a good
business ultimately?

00:16:47.890 --> 00:16:51.110
So some of the characteristics
are listed there.

00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:53.700
But, again, we've
talked about them.

00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:56.630
Now sometimes you
can go in between,

00:16:56.630 --> 00:17:01.450
where you have something more ad
driven, like a media business,

00:17:01.450 --> 00:17:05.930
where there's more economic
sensitivity but low capital

00:17:05.930 --> 00:17:07.250
requirements.

00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:11.040
There also may be more ease
of entry in the business.

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:12.800
Because of that,
service businesses

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:14.697
tend to have that
characteristic.

00:17:14.697 --> 00:17:16.530
Or the other way where
you have more capital

00:17:16.530 --> 00:17:22.119
required, like a
utility type model.

00:17:22.119 --> 00:17:23.960
And some of those will work.

00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:25.869
But remember, like
in the utility model,

00:17:25.869 --> 00:17:27.849
the only way to
get your ROE up--

00:17:27.849 --> 00:17:32.400
because you have a low
ROA-- is to leverage it.

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:35.690
You have steady cash
flows hopefully.

00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:38.657
But if you have a real
downturn, like a period

00:17:38.657 --> 00:17:40.115
like the Depression
was, there were

00:17:40.115 --> 00:17:45.290
a lot of utilities that ended
up going bankrupt in the '30s.

00:17:45.290 --> 00:17:49.150
So that's an example.

00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:51.250
Now the second-- whoops.

00:17:51.250 --> 00:17:53.820
We talked about-- well, we can
talk about winners and losers.

00:17:56.570 --> 00:18:01.380
We've talked a little bit about
that with GM and the Philip

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:03.940
Morris part.

00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:07.070
By the way, I remember
after I left and started

00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:09.120
my own company, as
I was leaving I'd

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:14.210
been at Selected Financial
for a little over nine years,

00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:18.480
and eight and a half years I had
run the Selected American fund.

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:22.240
And it was the fifth best
performing fund in the country.

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:24.050
And then I'd gotten
the Morningstar Manager

00:18:24.050 --> 00:18:25.290
of the Year award and stuff.

00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:31.300
But anyway to help me
remember to be modest,

00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:33.280
I remember the people
in the office--

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:35.090
it was tied in with
a brokerage firm.

00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:37.820
And they gave me two T-shirts.

00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:40.190
And one of them had
winners and the other one

00:18:40.190 --> 00:18:41.470
had losers on the back.

00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:43.040
And there were about 10 of each.

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:45.484
So it helps us keep humble.

00:18:45.484 --> 00:18:46.900
The one thing about
this business,

00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:49.070
by the way-- if you're in
the investment business--

00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:51.310
to remember and that
is basically you're

00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:54.640
almost always wrong
to some degree.

00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:56.257
Nobody buys everything
at the bottom

00:18:56.257 --> 00:18:57.590
and sells everything at the top.

00:18:57.590 --> 00:18:59.470
It just doesn't work that way.

00:18:59.470 --> 00:19:02.850
So it's a business
to stay humble in.

00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:06.140
Next one is the
investment process

00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:08.670
of the shareholder-- or,
I mean, of the management

00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:10.720
of the company.

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:14.350
And conceptually, if
you think about what

00:19:14.350 --> 00:19:17.510
you're doing when
you buy an equity is

00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:20.740
you're buying two
cash flows generally.

00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:23.020
One is the cash flow
that is given out

00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:25.510
as a form of a
dividend and the other

00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:31.260
is the cash flow that is
retained by the management

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:33.120
and reinvested on your behalf.

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:34.830
That's the wild card.

00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:37.810
And as the longer term
your investment horizon

00:19:37.810 --> 00:19:41.260
is, the more important that
part of the investment equation

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:45.380
becomes because it can
affect rates of return

00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:47.522
over long periods of time.

00:19:47.522 --> 00:19:49.230
And in a way, think
of it just like you'd

00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:50.990
think of a stock as a bond.

00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:53.260
And that's the way
we think of it.

00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:55.250
And we'll come to the
valuation and talk

00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:57.580
about that in a minute.

00:19:57.580 --> 00:20:00.580
But here let's talk about
the reinvestment process

00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:05.240
because that's what's left over
after the dividend is paid.

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:10.220
And the management team
really has five basic options

00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:16.030
with the money that management--
or with the management retained

00:20:16.030 --> 00:20:17.140
money.

00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:19.250
The first one is to put
it back in the business--

00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:24.860
R&amp;D, marketing, cost reductions,
distributions, on and on an on.

00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:28.030
And trust me, if you
have a great business

00:20:28.030 --> 00:20:34.260
and you can grow units in
that business, it's wonderful.

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:38.260
The marginal rate of return
on new incremental growth

00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:39.860
is really, really excellent.

00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:41.560
And so it's a very
important part

00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:44.540
and I would never minimize that.

00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:46.820
The problem is as
companies start

00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:51.150
to get past their infancy, they
start to generate excess cash

00:20:51.150 --> 00:20:53.885
and usually they can't
absorb all the cash

00:20:53.885 --> 00:20:56.630
that they are generating
in their existing business,

00:20:56.630 --> 00:21:01.590
so they have to start
examining four other options.

00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:03.760
We talked about one of
them, which was a dividend.

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:07.240
And obviously one of them
is just sitting on it.

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:10.290
But there are two others that
they tend to look at too.

00:21:10.290 --> 00:21:13.170
And the next one is the
one that's so difficult,

00:21:13.170 --> 00:21:16.230
and that is making acquisitions.

00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:18.860
And too many times,
unfortunately, the egos

00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:23.710
override the economics
when acquisitions are made.

00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:26.400
And I think the
classic on this one

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:30.190
is if you go and look
at a company that's

00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:34.380
now part of Pepsi, but before
that it was Quaker Oats.

00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:38.070
Bill Smithburg was the
CEO of Quaker Oats.

00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:42.310
And he actually showed
both extremes, if you will.

00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:45.795
The first one is he went and
he bought Stokely-Van Camp.

00:21:45.795 --> 00:21:48.990
Now Stokely-Van Camp was in
the canned vegetable business.

00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:51.540
They had some food
chemical business

00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:56.380
and they also had one little
product called Gatorade.

00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:58.660
Well, what he really
wanted was the Gatorade.

00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:00.570
And eventually
after he bought it,

00:22:00.570 --> 00:22:04.340
he liquidated the
other pieces and he

00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:06.630
was left with
Gatorade, which was

00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:09.660
worth billions of
dollars by the time Pepsi

00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:11.650
purchased the company,
and has continued

00:22:11.650 --> 00:22:17.600
to be a very valuable
product line for PepsiCo.

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:23.755
Then in the '90s, he went
out and he bought Snapple.

00:22:23.755 --> 00:22:27.530
He had attempted to buy it once
before and hadn't gotten it.

00:22:27.530 --> 00:22:29.530
So he paid up this time.

00:22:29.530 --> 00:22:32.290
Paid like a billion
and a half for it

00:22:32.290 --> 00:22:35.130
and then realized the
distribution was not

00:22:35.130 --> 00:22:38.470
tied in with the other
pieces of the company.

00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:39.850
It didn't work out very well.

00:22:39.850 --> 00:22:42.250
And they ended up selling it
and losing a billion dollars

00:22:42.250 --> 00:22:44.214
in the process.

00:22:44.214 --> 00:22:45.255
And so it was a disaster.

00:22:45.255 --> 00:22:48.190
It cost him his job.

00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:51.060
So that gives you the
extremes-- the winner

00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:54.160
and loser aspects of that.

00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:56.460
The third one is
buying back stock.

00:22:56.460 --> 00:22:59.140
And here at least you
know what you have.

00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:02.590
You're just buying a bigger
piece of the pie, so to speak,

00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:04.350
so that the
shareholder who's left

00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:09.270
has a bigger share of the
earnings as a shareholder.

00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:11.330
So those are the
five basic options.

00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:16.410
Again, put money back in
the business, acquisitions,

00:23:16.410 --> 00:23:19.860
purchase their own
stock, pay a dividend,

00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:24.840
or sit on it through reducing
debt or raising cash.

00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:28.580
Those are the things that
are important to analyze.

00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:32.282
And we've talked about
the winner and loser here.

00:23:32.282 --> 00:23:33.740
Now let's talk
about the investment

00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:36.530
strategy of purchasing price.

00:23:39.650 --> 00:23:42.950
The way we look at
it is think of it

00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:46.780
in terms of a forward
risk-adjusted rate of return.

00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:48.290
In other words,
take into account

00:23:48.290 --> 00:23:51.380
the best you possibly
can-- when you're looking

00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:53.770
at a business-- the pieces.

00:23:53.770 --> 00:23:55.690
In most cases, you
have a dividend

00:23:55.690 --> 00:23:58.120
and you should know
what the dividend is

00:23:58.120 --> 00:23:59.580
when you buy it
and you should have

00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:03.950
a pretty good handle on your
historical reinvestment rate.

00:24:03.950 --> 00:24:07.327
So the wild card in investing
is what the management

00:24:07.327 --> 00:24:08.160
does with the money.

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:10.780
We've talked about
those options.

00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:13.320
And that's the one that
requires some effort.

00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:16.260
Now in effect what
you'll end up with

00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:18.940
is starting to look
at ranges of outcomes

00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:23.240
because nobody can predict the
future with absolute certainty.

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:25.730
And the more predictable the
business, the narrower the

00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:26.260
ranges.

00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:29.080
The less predictable,
the wider the ranges.

00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:32.850
And that has implications
also on sizing

00:24:32.850 --> 00:24:37.240
because as your
probability goes up

00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:40.410
and you feel more comfortable
with the investment,

00:24:40.410 --> 00:24:44.440
both from a valuation and from
a business model standpoint,

00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:46.270
the more money one
should focus in on.

00:24:46.270 --> 00:24:51.740
And so the biggest holdings
should be in the companies

00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:54.480
where you have the
most confidence in.

00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:56.817
So I tell anybody if they
look at our portfolio, well,

00:24:56.817 --> 00:24:57.900
what do you like the best?

00:24:57.900 --> 00:25:00.830
We'll just start with the one
we have the biggest holding in.

00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:05.060
And when you have less
confidence, you should have--

00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:08.040
and you have a wider range
of outcomes, in effect,

00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:10.440
it's sort of like being
a wildcat oil driller.

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:13.440
You want to spread your risk,
and so you put a smaller

00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:17.100
percentage into those holdings.

00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:20.450
But the element is to find
as many as you possibly

00:25:20.450 --> 00:25:23.640
can of great businesses
at a low purchase

00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:26.380
price or a reasonable
purchase price

00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:30.790
and hold them for a long period
of time and have patience.

00:25:30.790 --> 00:25:33.210
And just to give you
an idea of sometimes

00:25:33.210 --> 00:25:39.900
how long that patience
can be-- back in 2000,

00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:42.310
we bought a company called
Lancaster Co Colony.

00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:46.690
And Lancaster Colony,
about 90% of their earnings

00:25:46.690 --> 00:25:50.270
eventually became in specialty
foods-- half grocery store

00:25:50.270 --> 00:25:57.030
and half through restaurants.

00:25:57.030 --> 00:26:00.080
Things like Sister
Schubert's rolls.

00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:02.560
My kids love those rolls.

00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:05.260
They're frozen rolls.

00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:07.680
Marzetti's dips and
salad dressings.

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:09.260
Those are the biggest part.

00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:12.250
But they're heavily
dependent on soybean oil.

00:26:12.250 --> 00:26:16.000
And so we have been so
brilliant as a country

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.900
as to tie in the cost of
food with the cost of energy

00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:23.830
because 40% of the corn crop
is used to make ethanol.

00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:25.860
How dumb is that, right?

00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:32.090
So, anyway, as a result of that,
the price of soybean and corn

00:26:32.090 --> 00:26:36.030
tend to line up with the
price of oil to some degree.

00:26:36.030 --> 00:26:38.560
And so this company,
for instance,

00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:40.420
was getting squeezed
as the price of oil

00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:45.910
went up after that period of
time into the mid-2000 period.

00:26:45.910 --> 00:26:48.130
But as oil peaked out
and started to decline

00:26:48.130 --> 00:26:53.000
and the market declined in '08,
this company by this time had

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.290
been squeezed enough they
started to raise prices

00:26:55.290 --> 00:26:58.530
and their costs went down
and their earnings exploded.

00:26:58.530 --> 00:27:01.790
And this stock actually went
up while the market went down.

00:27:01.790 --> 00:27:03.990
Just to give you an idea.

00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:07.270
So sometimes it
takes a long period

00:27:07.270 --> 00:27:10.300
of time for the final
things to work out

00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:13.060
the way you'd like
them to work out.

00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:15.700
But the key point
is have patience.

00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:19.770
Have a very long horizon
time and have patience.

00:27:19.770 --> 00:27:29.260
Well, I think we're kind
of at this point in time--

00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:32.560
my time is about right actually.

00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:34.506
Before I open it up
for Q&amp;A, though, I

00:27:34.506 --> 00:27:38.910
want to tell you a little
story about the money manager

00:27:38.910 --> 00:27:42.200
that went around
with his assistant.

00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:44.650
And he went around
and they would talk.

00:27:44.650 --> 00:27:49.070
And the assistant kept hearing
him talk and give his spiel.

00:27:49.070 --> 00:27:51.220
And finally, after
many, many times,

00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:53.520
the assistant looked at him
and he said, you know what?

00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:55.370
He said, I have
heard you deliver

00:27:55.370 --> 00:27:58.370
that message so many times now.

00:27:58.370 --> 00:28:01.950
He says, I think I could
do it as well as you do.

00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:05.130
So they said, well, let's
try it the next place.

00:28:05.130 --> 00:28:07.440
So they reversed roles.

00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:11.140
And the assistant went up there
and he delivered the message

00:28:11.140 --> 00:28:15.050
just brilliantly just
like the money manager.

00:28:15.050 --> 00:28:17.480
At which point he
opened it up for Q&amp;A.

00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:19.290
And the first question
right out of the box

00:28:19.290 --> 00:28:23.010
was Mr. Money Manager, what do
you attest your positive alpha

00:28:23.010 --> 00:28:23.510
to?

00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:27.401
Is it your low beta or your
low standard deviation?

00:28:27.401 --> 00:28:30.530
At which point he looked at
his money manager and he said,

00:28:30.530 --> 00:28:31.150
you know what?

00:28:31.150 --> 00:28:33.709
He said, that question
is so easy I'm going

00:28:33.709 --> 00:28:35.000
to have my assistant answer it.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.353
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:37.710 --> 00:28:42.490
So with that in mind, I'll
open it up for some questions

00:28:42.490 --> 00:28:43.840
that you may have.

00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:46.920
AUDIENCE: One thing I wanted
you to touch upon if you can is

00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:50.370
you mentioned the
importance of patience.

00:28:50.370 --> 00:28:54.545
But there's a little
bit of contrarianism

00:28:54.545 --> 00:28:56.660
in going on your own.

00:28:56.660 --> 00:29:02.070
And when those beach balls have
not really risen to the top

00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:08.030
and everybody else is
looking at you with doubt--

00:29:08.030 --> 00:29:10.220
have you been in
such a situation?

00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:11.267
How has that felt like?

00:29:11.267 --> 00:29:12.850
I just wanted you
to talk a little bit

00:29:12.850 --> 00:29:15.460
about the psychology of things
because you mentioned this

00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:17.110
in your previous interviews.

00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:18.026
DONALD YACKTMAN: Yeah.

00:29:18.026 --> 00:29:19.930
That's sort of the
fat pitch right

00:29:19.930 --> 00:29:22.330
over the heart of the plate.

00:29:22.330 --> 00:29:24.572
There's a baseball analogy.

00:29:24.572 --> 00:29:32.930
Yeah, that certainly happened
to us going into '99 and 2000.

00:29:32.930 --> 00:29:37.820
And maybe that's another thing
I-- my personal life, I think,

00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:43.290
helps strengthen that whole
situation because I view us

00:29:43.290 --> 00:29:45.340
on this earth as to
having more than just

00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:46.780
to be out here to make money.

00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:50.530
And I think to provide service
and do other things for people

00:29:50.530 --> 00:29:52.260
and to be involved in a family.

00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:56.670
And so I think that really
helped in that period of time.

00:29:56.670 --> 00:30:01.740
But I think it's really
important to stay focused

00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:03.350
and to be patient.

00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:05.900
My kids, again, they tease
me about my dad-isms.

00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:09.310
One of them is there's a
narrow difference between being

00:30:09.310 --> 00:30:11.540
determined and stubborn.

00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:14.483
If at the end of the day you're
right, you're determined.

00:30:14.483 --> 00:30:15.872
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:17.261 --> 00:30:18.650
OK.

00:30:18.650 --> 00:30:23.210
So And I think that
long horizon time really

00:30:23.210 --> 00:30:27.440
does make a difference and
it really does separate us

00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:29.786
from so many people out there.

00:30:29.786 --> 00:30:33.960
And I think that's something
that value managers, I think,

00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:35.510
really do have more.

00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:38.000
But there's tremendous
pressure in this business--

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:41.420
tremendous pressure
for short-term results.

00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:43.200
I remember when I
was traveling once

00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:48.580
and I looked at "USA Today" and
it talked about horizon time.

00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:51.650
And virtually nobody has more
than a three-year horizon time.

00:30:51.650 --> 00:30:53.390
And yet I will
tell you that there

00:30:53.390 --> 00:30:56.000
are periods of time where
we can go three years

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:57.600
and underperform the market.

00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:00.380
It's not that difficult
really if you're

00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:04.530
using this kind of a strategy
to have a period like that.

00:31:04.530 --> 00:31:07.080
And that's why that peak to
peak really makes a difference.

00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:10.660
I'll tell you what's critical
is to think of it in terms

00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:13.940
of you're a CFO of a company.

00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:18.177
And if you can buy things
above your cost of capital,

00:31:18.177 --> 00:31:19.260
then you should be buying.

00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:22.540
And so when '08 and '09 hit,
a lot of people said, well,

00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:24.750
how could you do well
in both periods of time?

00:31:24.750 --> 00:31:29.190
Well, if you can
find opportunities,

00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:32.290
it's sort of like playing chess
or playing war, if you will.

00:31:32.290 --> 00:31:34.640
You always want to move forward.

00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:36.675
OK.

00:31:36.675 --> 00:31:39.890
And in '08 we were fully
invested before the market

00:31:39.890 --> 00:31:41.580
bottomed.

00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:44.100
And then the market
went down another 20%.

00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:49.900
I remember telling people
at Christmas, I said,

00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:51.940
if you're a value
investor and you

00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:56.230
can't find things to buy today,
there's a disconnect, OK?

00:31:56.230 --> 00:31:57.870
And then it went down 20% more.

00:31:57.870 --> 00:31:59.160
So you cannot call it.

00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:03.090
But what you can do is
feel very comfortable

00:32:03.090 --> 00:32:05.860
and think of it in terms
of using your cash reserves

00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:09.470
and then having the things
that are very high quality--

00:32:09.470 --> 00:32:12.170
your AAA bonds, if you
will, of your portfolio,

00:32:12.170 --> 00:32:14.810
the highest quality
stocks-- that

00:32:14.810 --> 00:32:17.210
will tend to hold up
better in that environment.

00:32:17.210 --> 00:32:19.580
You can start to
let some of those go

00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:22.560
and then [INAUDIBLE]
that money into things

00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:25.780
that have been crushed that are
really excellent businesses.

00:32:25.780 --> 00:32:28.760
But they may be a
AA or a single A,

00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:31.570
but they have a lot
more upside potential.

00:32:31.570 --> 00:32:34.830
And be willing to shift those
where you can dramatically

00:32:34.830 --> 00:32:38.440
increase your rate of return
in the investment you have.

00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:40.456
So I hope-- does that
answer your question?

00:32:40.456 --> 00:32:41.080
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:44.440
You mentioned in
1999-2000, could you

00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:45.850
maybe describe the situation?

00:32:45.850 --> 00:32:46.880
What was the setting?

00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:48.550
What were you alluding to?

00:32:48.550 --> 00:32:50.920
DONALD YACKTMAN: Well,
I mean, I even wrote

00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:54.410
in a report-- a
couple of reports

00:32:54.410 --> 00:32:56.970
actually-- to shareholders.

00:32:56.970 --> 00:33:01.640
One was that anybody-- because
this was the dot-com period

00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:05.730
and a lot of people
were selling things

00:33:05.730 --> 00:33:10.489
over the internet for $0.75
that cost them a dollar.

00:33:10.489 --> 00:33:12.155
Well, I mean, I can
go out on the street

00:33:12.155 --> 00:33:14.590
and give away dollar
bills for $0.75.

00:33:14.590 --> 00:33:17.320
I wouldn't have any trouble
getting rid of them.

00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:19.890
That's possible, but it
doesn't make any sense.

00:33:19.890 --> 00:33:22.160
The whole thing
didn't make any sense.

00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:24.880
By the way, I remember
I used Neutrogena soap.

00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:27.390
No ad intended here.

00:33:27.390 --> 00:33:30.040
And I bought about $100
worth of Neutrogena soap

00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:34.900
from one of those guys, one of
those websites, a several year

00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:37.576
supply because it
was such a bargain.

00:33:37.576 --> 00:33:38.854
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:42.491
Again, my kids tease me
about my bargain hunting too.

00:33:42.491 --> 00:33:44.740
That's another thing I will
tell you in this business.

00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:49.220
If you go into a value manager's
office and it's opulent,

00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:51.043
there's probably a
disconnect there too.

00:33:51.043 --> 00:33:52.010
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:52.010 --> 00:33:55.320
Because most value managers
do not have opulent offices.

00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:58.005
MALE SPEAKER: Don, what were
you buying in '99 and 2000?

00:33:58.005 --> 00:33:59.630
DONALD YACKTMAN:
Well, it's interesting

00:33:59.630 --> 00:34:05.330
because in that
period of time there

00:34:05.330 --> 00:34:09.170
were some things
that were crushed

00:34:09.170 --> 00:34:13.026
and one of those we mentioned
was Philip Morris that

00:34:13.026 --> 00:34:14.900
had had its suit in Florida.

00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:22.210
I don't use the product, but
one of the things that struck me

00:34:22.210 --> 00:34:26.199
about this is that
there is a fellow who's

00:34:26.199 --> 00:34:27.889
on the board--
you may have heard

00:34:27.889 --> 00:34:30.100
of him-- named Carlos Slim.

00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:32.560
And Carlos Slim was one of the
wealthiest men in the world.

00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:35.960
And Carlos Slim actually
bought some Philip Morris right

00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:39.510
near the bottom at that period
of time with his own money.

00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:42.780
Now there's a lot of reasons
why people will sell stock

00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:45.100
if they're insiders, but
there's only one reason

00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:49.440
they'll use their own
money to buy stock.

00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:51.750
Only one reason.

00:34:51.750 --> 00:34:53.199
But the other
thing that happened

00:34:53.199 --> 00:34:56.949
is a lot of the really big
companies-- good businesses--

00:34:56.949 --> 00:34:58.040
were very overpriced.

00:34:58.040 --> 00:35:03.960
I mean, like Coca Cola, it
basically-- even today it's

00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:10.470
only barely passed-- recently it
passed the high it hit in 1998.

00:35:10.470 --> 00:35:13.860
Five years or seven years
later when we were buying it,

00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:15.920
it was less than half that.

00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:20.430
So these companies go through
these really odd valuation

00:35:20.430 --> 00:35:21.390
periods.

00:35:21.390 --> 00:35:25.470
But we ended up buying a lot
of middle-sized and smaller

00:35:25.470 --> 00:35:28.240
companies because those
were where the bargains were

00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:31.210
in that period of time.

00:35:31.210 --> 00:35:36.080
One of them, I remember
being on a phone call in 1998

00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:42.350
with a famous money manager
that I won't reveal his name.

00:35:42.350 --> 00:35:47.010
He's more of a momentum
driven growth kind of guy.

00:35:47.010 --> 00:35:50.220
To me, growth and value
are joined at the hip.

00:35:50.220 --> 00:35:53.810
I mean, to me it's just like
looking at risk adjusted

00:35:53.810 --> 00:35:55.700
forward returns and bonds.

00:35:55.700 --> 00:36:00.820
But anyway, so, he picked Pfizer
and we had just sold Pfizer.

00:36:00.820 --> 00:36:03.420
And that was when the
little blue pill came out.

00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:07.130
And the stock went
way ahead of itself.

00:36:07.130 --> 00:36:10.530
And we bought a company
called First Data, which

00:36:10.530 --> 00:36:13.410
eventually went private.

00:36:13.410 --> 00:36:17.750
But we later bought
Pfizer back about five,

00:36:17.750 --> 00:36:21.440
seven years later
at a lower price

00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:23.020
than what we had sold it at.

00:36:23.020 --> 00:36:26.750
And in the meantime, I
think First Data tripled.

00:36:26.750 --> 00:36:29.050
It's a matter of also
being flexible and being

00:36:29.050 --> 00:36:31.850
willing to look at the
world in an objective way.

00:36:31.850 --> 00:36:34.145
AUDIENCE: Thank you, Mr. Don.

00:36:34.145 --> 00:36:39.690
Can you compare Amazon and
Apple with the strategry

00:36:39.690 --> 00:36:41.940
you are talking about?

00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:45.151
I think both companies are
very good company in terms

00:36:45.151 --> 00:36:46.734
of the business you
are talking about,

00:36:46.734 --> 00:36:50.143
but they have very different
investment strategy.

00:36:50.143 --> 00:36:57.712
And Apple will hold tons of cash
and Amazon just barely earned

00:36:57.712 --> 00:36:59.000
in the last quarter.

00:37:01.207 --> 00:37:02.040
DONALD YACKTMAN: OK.

00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:02.646
I know Apple.

00:37:02.646 --> 00:37:03.520
What's the other one?

00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:04.170
AUDIENCE: Audience.

00:37:04.170 --> 00:37:05.169
DONALD YACKTMAN: Amazon.

00:37:05.169 --> 00:37:06.455
Oh, OK.

00:37:06.455 --> 00:37:06.955
Yeah.

00:37:09.530 --> 00:37:10.850
They're very different.

00:37:10.850 --> 00:37:13.680
They're very different
companies, totally different.

00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:18.920
My worry with Apple,
frankly-- and we actually

00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:21.930
talked about this a little
before the meeting too.

00:37:21.930 --> 00:37:23.540
And I've been wrong
in the short-term,

00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:28.880
but Clayton Christensen, who's
at Harvard Business School-- I

00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:32.120
remember after having commented
about Apple's strategy,

00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:34.030
he lined up right with me.

00:37:34.030 --> 00:37:35.110
Here's the problem I see.

00:37:35.110 --> 00:37:39.670
I think their strategy is
designed for a niche type

00:37:39.670 --> 00:37:40.390
market.

00:37:40.390 --> 00:37:44.050
And I think in the long term,
the company that has the bigger

00:37:44.050 --> 00:37:48.200
market share and the lower cost
position has a much more stable

00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:49.590
situation.

00:37:49.590 --> 00:37:51.360
Now it's tough in
technology because you

00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:53.290
have a lot of shooting
stars and everything.

00:37:53.290 --> 00:37:55.470
But I think they have
unsustainable margins.

00:37:55.470 --> 00:37:56.850
I really do.

00:37:56.850 --> 00:38:01.150
And, I mean, I think if you
can get something that has 70--

00:38:01.150 --> 00:38:06.510
maybe 50 even-- but 70%-80% of
the same features for much less

00:38:06.510 --> 00:38:10.512
money, for half the
price or 2/3 or whatever,

00:38:10.512 --> 00:38:11.720
it's just going to work more.

00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:15.680
And I think the open
architecture is a better way

00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:21.400
to go because it allows more
spread of costs ultimately.

00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:24.020
So that's my dilemma that way.

00:38:24.020 --> 00:38:26.640
Amazon's strategy
is very unique.

00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:28.700
And it has kind of this halo.

00:38:28.700 --> 00:38:30.005
Retailing's a tough business.

00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:39.290
At some point, they're going
to have to make some money.

00:38:39.290 --> 00:38:42.980
What their strategy is--
and it's a clever strategy--

00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:46.310
is to just have
virtually no margin

00:38:46.310 --> 00:38:49.110
and make no money to
expand market share.

00:38:49.110 --> 00:38:51.880
But, again, to some degree, it's
a little bit like those dotcom

00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:54.490
companies, so to speak.

00:38:54.490 --> 00:38:56.210
At some point you got
to make some money

00:38:56.210 --> 00:38:58.612
to develop the
capital to feed it.

00:38:58.612 --> 00:39:00.070
Now some of the
way they've done it

00:39:00.070 --> 00:39:03.700
is because they're trying to
move a little bit where you're

00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:07.810
laying off more of the capital
and in effect the inventory

00:39:07.810 --> 00:39:09.330
onto other people.

00:39:09.330 --> 00:39:15.600
And so they're going to become
more of a middle man for that.

00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:17.910
I think it's a
tremendous strategy,

00:39:17.910 --> 00:39:21.150
but I think it's
tough to justify

00:39:21.150 --> 00:39:23.760
the price that it's at to me.

00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:26.940
But, again, it's still early.

00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:29.160
I think their market cap
now is bigger than Walmart,

00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:30.000
as an example.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:31.340
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:39:31.340 --> 00:39:35.360
DONALD YACKTMAN: So the dilemma
in the growth stock strategy,

00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:44.260
if you so speak go that way, is
that there's a lot more attempt

00:39:44.260 --> 00:39:47.350
to evaluate the future and it
becomes much more difficult.

00:39:47.350 --> 00:39:48.760
That's the problem.

00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:51.490
I feel a lot more comfortable
with more stability

00:39:51.490 --> 00:39:54.280
after things have
shaken out somewhat

00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:55.630
where things are clear.

00:39:55.630 --> 00:39:59.730
But then I tend to lean more
toward the AAA bond type model.

00:39:59.730 --> 00:40:03.380
To me these are not
AAA bonds, so to speak.

00:40:03.380 --> 00:40:05.520
They're a lot more risky.

00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:09.280
And you're making
judgments that may not

00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:14.670
last-- companies just don't
grow at high rates indefinitely.

00:40:14.670 --> 00:40:17.770
I mean, think
about-- anybody who's

00:40:17.770 --> 00:40:20.410
in statistics or
mathematics-- and most of you

00:40:20.410 --> 00:40:23.220
are obviously very
good in those areas

00:40:23.220 --> 00:40:25.140
or you wouldn't
be working here--

00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:27.840
you can just see-- otherwise
you'd own the world, right?

00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:29.930
I mean, if you grew fast enough.

00:40:29.930 --> 00:40:33.140
So it just mathematically
doesn't work I think.

00:40:33.140 --> 00:40:35.290
And that's what
makes it a dilemma.

00:40:35.290 --> 00:40:38.350
But in the short term,
remember as I think

00:40:38.350 --> 00:40:42.800
it was-- as Ben Graham said.

00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:45.250
He said, in the short term,
it's a voting machine.

00:40:45.250 --> 00:40:47.720
In the long term, it's
a weighing machine.

00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:52.170
So I think the popularity--
probably 70% of people

00:40:52.170 --> 00:40:53.640
are momentum investors.

00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:55.280
They're rear view
mirror investors.

00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:57.674
They buy what has been
good with the idea

00:40:57.674 --> 00:40:59.340
that it's going it's
going to be better.

00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:02.610
There's one company
that made a career out

00:41:02.610 --> 00:41:04.900
of saying we'll buy
things when they

00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:09.530
make an all-time high because
they tend to run after that.

00:41:09.530 --> 00:41:13.770
Very dangerous kind
of strategy I think.

00:41:13.770 --> 00:41:15.960
And let me give--
a lot of credit

00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:18.390
should go to Steve,
my son, on that one

00:41:18.390 --> 00:41:20.720
because he did a lot
of work on AmeriCredit.

00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:27.160
And what was unique about
AmeriCredit-- financial stocks,

00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:32.320
by their very nature, are low
return on asset businesses

00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:35.570
because they make their
money through leverage.

00:41:35.570 --> 00:41:37.970
And that makes them
very vulnerable.

00:41:37.970 --> 00:41:43.800
Now what made AmeriCredit
unique in more than one way

00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:46.070
from a business
model standpoint--

00:41:46.070 --> 00:41:48.720
First of all, about
40% of their money,

00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:52.700
they got back in the first year.

00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:55.410
Number two is they
had collateral.

00:41:55.410 --> 00:41:59.010
Now the collateral
tended to be about 40%

00:41:59.010 --> 00:42:01.450
if they had to repo the car.

00:42:01.450 --> 00:42:05.410
Third is, people
in today's world,

00:42:05.410 --> 00:42:07.840
they tend to be not
as many homeowners,

00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:10.240
so that you didn't have the
same overlap with people

00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:13.150
who are overleveraged in
their home investment.

00:42:13.150 --> 00:42:17.390
These lot of people were
apartment dwellers and so on.

00:42:17.390 --> 00:42:21.010
Their problem wasn't the
basic business model.

00:42:21.010 --> 00:42:24.590
Their problem was the freezing
up of the capital markets.

00:42:24.590 --> 00:42:28.610
Because what they ended
up having to do is they

00:42:28.610 --> 00:42:31.770
would collateralize
these mortgages

00:42:31.770 --> 00:42:34.900
or package these
mortgages and sell them

00:42:34.900 --> 00:42:38.850
as a collateralized debt piece.

00:42:38.850 --> 00:42:42.440
And so when the markets
tended to freeze,

00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:44.400
they had to basically
wait for the payments

00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:47.760
to come in before they
could relend the money.

00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:50.470
So at the worst case
scenario, they were basically

00:42:50.470 --> 00:42:52.530
running it close to break-even.

00:42:52.530 --> 00:42:54.450
And the stock had a book.

00:42:54.450 --> 00:42:58.880
And so the book was about $15 a
share, $16, somewhere in there.

00:43:01.710 --> 00:43:03.890
And it's hard to say
in any financial stock

00:43:03.890 --> 00:43:05.280
that the book is solid.

00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:08.390
But as much as you could
say, that was there.

00:43:08.390 --> 00:43:10.060
The other thing is
psychologically,

00:43:10.060 --> 00:43:17.720
you told somebody you're
buying a used car subprime auto

00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:20.570
lender, it sent
up all the flashes

00:43:20.570 --> 00:43:23.950
that you can imagine of
negative characteristics

00:43:23.950 --> 00:43:26.110
to people in that environment.

00:43:26.110 --> 00:43:27.540
And so the stock
went down to $3.

00:43:27.540 --> 00:43:30.160
It was down to 20%
of book at one time.

00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:33.190
GM actually bought the thing out
because they had sold off GMAC

00:43:33.190 --> 00:43:39.210
and they bought it at like
$23 within a couple of years

00:43:39.210 --> 00:43:39.710
after that.

00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:45.200
But, again, it was a
unique business model.

00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:50.910
I'm not enamored
with big city money

00:43:50.910 --> 00:43:52.730
centered banking institutions.

00:43:52.730 --> 00:43:55.600
I mean, to me, the
other side is look

00:43:55.600 --> 00:44:00.250
at how tough it
was for Jamie Dimon

00:44:00.250 --> 00:44:03.090
to run Morgan Stanley when
you have the whales show up.

00:44:03.090 --> 00:44:05.620
I mean, and here's a guy
who's a brilliant operating

00:44:05.620 --> 00:44:08.650
man still has something
like that happen to him.

00:44:08.650 --> 00:44:14.580
It tells you how difficult it is
to deal with a bank like that.

00:44:14.580 --> 00:44:16.710
So be careful on
financial stocks.

00:44:16.710 --> 00:44:17.360
Yes?

00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:19.193
AUDIENCE: I've heard
some fund managers talk

00:44:19.193 --> 00:44:22.980
about they only have
two good ideas a year

00:44:22.980 --> 00:44:24.860
and they'll go big on those.

00:44:24.860 --> 00:44:28.250
And you talked about increasing
your investment size when you

00:44:28.250 --> 00:44:31.380
have that kind of conviction.

00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:34.724
I wonder, how do you
come up with good ideas?

00:44:34.724 --> 00:44:36.390
DONALD YACKTMAN: How
do I come up with--

00:44:36.390 --> 00:44:39.810
AUDIENCE: How do you come up
with good investment ideas?

00:44:39.810 --> 00:44:41.077
How do you find them?

00:44:41.077 --> 00:44:42.410
Where does it come from for you?

00:44:42.410 --> 00:44:45.110
DONALD YACKTMAN: Oh, I think
they can come from any place.

00:44:45.110 --> 00:44:48.440
I think over the
years to some degree

00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:52.730
maybe it's a little
bit like Potter Stewart

00:44:52.730 --> 00:44:57.200
the Supreme Court Justice
when he was asked about how

00:44:57.200 --> 00:44:58.840
he knows pornography
and he says, well,

00:44:58.840 --> 00:44:59.910
I know it when I see it.

00:44:59.910 --> 00:45:00.941
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:06.344
So I think after you
do this so many years,

00:45:06.344 --> 00:45:08.510
within a matter of minutes
you can look at something

00:45:08.510 --> 00:45:11.750
and say, yeah, that
one looks really good.

00:45:11.750 --> 00:45:16.880
But based on the place you
are in the market cycle

00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:20.300
and, I mean, valuation levels
and so on and so forth.

00:45:20.300 --> 00:45:23.290
So there's a lot of variables
to take into account.

00:45:23.290 --> 00:45:26.740
But I think one of
the best ways is

00:45:26.740 --> 00:45:29.480
to look at things that
have short-term problems.

00:45:29.480 --> 00:45:36.380
There are really three opportune
times to make purchases.

00:45:36.380 --> 00:45:38.530
One of them is when
the market goes down.

00:45:38.530 --> 00:45:41.770
And when the market goes down--
think of these as like wind

00:45:41.770 --> 00:45:46.487
coming through an orchard
and some fruit then

00:45:46.487 --> 00:45:47.320
drops to the ground.

00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:49.690
It's very easy to look at it.

00:45:49.690 --> 00:45:54.350
So it can be like a situation
where the whole marketplace

00:45:54.350 --> 00:45:56.500
collapses, like it
did it '08 and '09.

00:45:56.500 --> 00:45:58.510
I mean, that was
a dream come true

00:45:58.510 --> 00:46:00.800
where you have an
opportunity like that.

00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:04.560
I remember walking into the
board of directors of our funds

00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:07.050
in late October.

00:46:07.050 --> 00:46:11.110
And one of the fellows who
was a classmate of mine

00:46:11.110 --> 00:46:12.710
at Harvard Business School.

00:46:12.710 --> 00:46:16.300
And he said, man, it must
be really tough out there.

00:46:16.300 --> 00:46:18.140
And we're kind of
dancing in the streets.

00:46:18.140 --> 00:46:19.390
I mean, literally.

00:46:19.390 --> 00:46:21.880
Kind of like, oh
no, this is great.

00:46:21.880 --> 00:46:24.250
So some part of that's
a mentality thing.

00:46:24.250 --> 00:46:27.010
And it's just getting
used to looking

00:46:27.010 --> 00:46:28.950
at things in an objective way.

00:46:28.950 --> 00:46:30.380
So the market going down is one.

00:46:30.380 --> 00:46:33.430
The second one is an
industry shortfall.

00:46:33.430 --> 00:46:35.890
And the classic
of this one would

00:46:35.890 --> 00:46:39.990
have been 1993 when there
was a concern at that point

00:46:39.990 --> 00:46:43.500
about changing the health
care industry dramatically

00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:46.410
when the Clintons first
came-- or [INAUDIBLE] Clinton

00:46:46.410 --> 00:46:47.250
came into office.

00:46:47.250 --> 00:46:48.639
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:50.030 --> 00:46:51.190
Let me not go there.

00:46:51.190 --> 00:46:52.370
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:52.370 --> 00:46:56.240
So anyway I think we
ended up with a third

00:46:56.240 --> 00:47:00.250
of the portfolio in either drug
or hospital supply companies.

00:47:00.250 --> 00:47:02.240
They were just beaten up.

00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:05.030
And just one after
another after another.

00:47:05.030 --> 00:47:10.040
The difference was between then
and a closer period, like now,

00:47:10.040 --> 00:47:13.600
is the drug companies had
a much bigger pipeline.

00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:15.670
And so there were a
lot more companies

00:47:15.670 --> 00:47:18.000
that were more interesting.

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:23.270
The third one is where you
have an individual stock that's

00:47:23.270 --> 00:47:25.320
not down, but it's
temporarily out of favor.

00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:29.670
I referred back in '98
to the First Data thing.

00:47:29.670 --> 00:47:33.170
First Data had made a
purchase of another company.

00:47:33.170 --> 00:47:40.400
They process the payments
for credit card companies

00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:42.620
and merchants.

00:47:42.620 --> 00:47:44.630
And they had made a purchase.

00:47:44.630 --> 00:47:48.240
And as a result of that, they
were assimilating this company.

00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:52.530
And you had a temporary
flattening out, I think,

00:47:52.530 --> 00:47:54.590
it was more than
anything, of the earnings.

00:47:54.590 --> 00:47:58.145
So whereas the marketplace
had been used to this,

00:47:58.145 --> 00:47:59.770
and they had this,
they all of a sudden

00:47:59.770 --> 00:48:01.331
said, uh-oh, big problem.

00:48:01.331 --> 00:48:02.330
It wasn't a big problem.

00:48:02.330 --> 00:48:04.520
It was just an
assimilation problem.

00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:07.280
And so it created a
great buying opportunity.

00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:10.090
So those are the three
kind of things to look at.

00:48:10.090 --> 00:48:13.750
I remember many, many years
ago, a guy coming to my home.

00:48:13.750 --> 00:48:15.900
And we were talking
about investing.

00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:21.640
And he said that-- he was
just in contracting business.

00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:24.230
And he says, I do mine by
looking at the new Lowe's list

00:48:24.230 --> 00:48:25.830
in the newspaper.

00:48:25.830 --> 00:48:29.300
I thought, well, that
guy has got some savvy.

00:48:29.300 --> 00:48:31.730
Not that I would choose
that as the only source.

00:48:31.730 --> 00:48:35.352
But, in other words, you
look for opportunity,

00:48:35.352 --> 00:48:37.560
and that's when a lot of
times you're going to get it

00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:39.763
is under one of those
three conditions.

00:48:39.763 --> 00:48:40.596
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:48:40.596 --> 00:48:42.106
DONALD YACKTMAN: Question?

00:48:42.106 --> 00:48:43.060
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:48:43.060 --> 00:48:46.740
Thank you for
sharing your stories.

00:48:46.740 --> 00:48:50.540
So you just spoke about
you look for opportunity.

00:48:50.540 --> 00:48:52.790
What happens when you don't
find enough opportunities?

00:48:52.790 --> 00:48:55.369
How comfortable are
you holding cash?

00:48:55.369 --> 00:48:56.910
Or would you just
double down on what

00:48:56.910 --> 00:49:00.000
you have let's say in the
more, as Graham calls it,

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:02.780
the unpopular large
companies and just

00:49:02.780 --> 00:49:04.141
waiting out for the dividends.

00:49:04.141 --> 00:49:05.640
How do you think
about that problem?

00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:07.600
DONALD YACKTMAN: Yeah.

00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:12.160
Cash is a residual.

00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:15.130
But, again, one needs to
take into account when

00:49:15.130 --> 00:49:18.090
you think about having
cash, it shouldn't

00:49:18.090 --> 00:49:22.350
be because you're trying
to predict the market.

00:49:22.350 --> 00:49:24.660
In other words, if
you can find things

00:49:24.660 --> 00:49:27.660
above your cost of
capital, regardless

00:49:27.660 --> 00:49:31.020
of what the market level
is, one should do it.

00:49:31.020 --> 00:49:32.150
Think of it this way.

00:49:32.150 --> 00:49:36.010
If I'm in need of a
new shirt and I go out

00:49:36.010 --> 00:49:41.660
and I see one that I
like on sale, I buy one.

00:49:41.660 --> 00:49:44.670
But then I go into the store
again a week or two later

00:49:44.670 --> 00:49:48.280
and it's marked
down another 20%.

00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:50.400
Should I dispose
of the one I have?

00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:51.290
No.

00:49:51.290 --> 00:49:52.639
OK?

00:49:52.639 --> 00:49:54.430
If it's the kind of
shirt I'm going to wear

00:49:54.430 --> 00:49:56.920
and I'm going to wear for a
long time and I enjoy wearing,

00:49:56.920 --> 00:49:59.520
I should buy another one.

00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:05.340
So I think the use of
cash becomes important

00:50:05.340 --> 00:50:07.630
when you have the
opportunities there.

00:50:07.630 --> 00:50:10.340
But if you don't have
opportunity, then

00:50:10.340 --> 00:50:13.010
sometimes you're better off
just to sit on it and let it be.

00:50:13.010 --> 00:50:14.520
Just wait for those
opportunities.

00:50:14.520 --> 00:50:18.590
Because, again, you have enough
fluctuation in the marketplace

00:50:18.590 --> 00:50:20.300
that you're going to
get opportunities.

00:50:20.300 --> 00:50:21.740
It may be varied opportunities.

00:50:21.740 --> 00:50:26.690
It may be just a little addition
to what you already have.

00:50:26.690 --> 00:50:28.080
Or it may be a new addition.

00:50:28.080 --> 00:50:29.710
It could be either.

00:50:29.710 --> 00:50:33.770
But that's the way
I would view it.

00:50:33.770 --> 00:50:35.610
Again, I would be as
aggressive as you can.

00:50:35.610 --> 00:50:37.780
Now the other thing to take
into account-- and today

00:50:37.780 --> 00:50:41.620
we have a very unique
situation because when

00:50:41.620 --> 00:50:45.110
I look at the marketplace
and I look at the categories,

00:50:45.110 --> 00:50:48.610
the one that seems to be even
more overvalued than stocks--

00:50:48.610 --> 00:50:51.230
if you're looking at
overall valuations--

00:50:51.230 --> 00:50:53.320
are the long-term bonds.

00:50:53.320 --> 00:50:55.890
I mean, you can
get dividend deals

00:50:55.890 --> 00:50:58.980
on some of the high quality
companies that's higher

00:50:58.980 --> 00:51:01.460
than 10- or 30-year treasuries.

00:51:01.460 --> 00:51:05.340
Well, why on earth would
I want to own something

00:51:05.340 --> 00:51:11.060
that has no increase in
the dividend, so to speak,

00:51:11.060 --> 00:51:11.750
like that?

00:51:11.750 --> 00:51:12.910
Relative to the other.

00:51:12.910 --> 00:51:16.420
But it's a relative thing.

00:51:16.420 --> 00:51:20.960
At least in '07 you had some
decent interest from cash.

00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:22.980
Today you get no money on cash.

00:51:22.980 --> 00:51:26.470
So it pressures people to
lower their cost of capital

00:51:26.470 --> 00:51:29.640
to some degree to take
that variance into account

00:51:29.640 --> 00:51:32.850
because there's such an enormous
spread in the rates of return

00:51:32.850 --> 00:51:36.875
on a forward risk
adjusted basis.

00:51:36.875 --> 00:51:38.690
AUDIENCE: For those
of us who might

00:51:38.690 --> 00:51:42.800
be personal
individual investors,

00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:46.040
what general advice
do you have in terms

00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:50.045
of protecting your wealth
and maybe growing it?

00:51:50.045 --> 00:51:51.670
DONALD YACKTMAN:
Well, again, patience.

00:51:51.670 --> 00:51:54.000
I would highly
emphasize patience.

00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:57.740
I think the other thing is
find a strategy that you can

00:51:57.740 --> 00:51:58.910
live with and stick with it.

00:52:02.600 --> 00:52:09.820
Just from a personal standpoint,
I started out in 1968.

00:52:09.820 --> 00:52:12.580
And for every year
thereafter, basically,

00:52:12.580 --> 00:52:17.570
when I would get money, I'd put
it into whatever firm that was.

00:52:17.570 --> 00:52:22.140
I'd put it in effect into the
market because I was getting it

00:52:22.140 --> 00:52:25.870
on a continual basis, looking
at it as a very long-term thing.

00:52:25.870 --> 00:52:30.390
But think of it as a very
long-term investment.

00:52:30.390 --> 00:52:33.555
The magic of compound
interest is so important.

00:52:37.790 --> 00:52:42.400
Be both protective, but also
be aggressive at the same time.

00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:44.550
MALE SPEAKER: With
that, thank you so much.

00:52:44.550 --> 00:52:45.980
It was such a pleasure to
have you here for this.

00:52:45.980 --> 00:52:46.650
DONALD YACKTMAN: Well, thanks.

00:52:46.650 --> 00:52:47.810
Thanks for having me.

00:52:47.810 --> 00:52:50.260
[APPLAUSE]
