00:00:02.368 --> 00:00:05.143
(beeping)

00:00:05.143 --> 00:00:08.643
(upbeat electronic music)

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:18.863
(beeping)

00:00:18.863 --> 00:00:20.639
- And, of course nobody's here,

00:00:20.639 --> 00:00:22.560
I'll be zapping in the room first.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:23.657
(beeping)

00:00:23.657 --> 00:00:25.683
- Hey Lightning.

00:00:25.683 --> 00:00:26.768
- [Lightning] There we go, finally

00:00:26.768 --> 00:00:27.842
- Hey, hey buddy.

00:00:27.842 --> 00:00:28.759
- How's it going?

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:31.086
- I'm doing well, sorry
I'm a little bit late,

00:00:31.086 --> 00:00:33.246
I was having a Yurbomatte with the old

00:00:33.246 --> 00:00:35.496
archnemesis, The Composter.

00:00:36.536 --> 00:00:38.179
- Wazzaa!

00:00:38.179 --> 00:00:40.512
- [Lightning] Haha, I love that.

00:00:40.512 --> 00:00:42.410
- [Chill] Still funny. Still funny.

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:43.919
- Never gets old, right?

00:00:43.919 --> 00:00:46.856
- Guys, I don't want to, I
don't want to get everybody

00:00:46.856 --> 00:00:49.671
too excited, I just got a
couple new dream catchers.

00:00:49.671 --> 00:00:51.720
I hung 'em up so the
place is looking great.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.668
- Is your super power to
bore your enemies to death?

00:00:54.668 --> 00:00:56.110
(Lightning laughing)

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.943
(beeping)

00:00:56.943 --> 00:00:57.860
- Hey guys.

00:01:00.274 --> 00:01:02.473
- This is my friend Complacent Man.

00:01:02.473 --> 00:01:05.219
- Oh, I'm already tired of you guys.

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:07.778
- I know what your, I know
immediately what your deal is.

00:01:07.778 --> 00:01:12.259
- I was watching somebody
rob a bank. It was, yeah.

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:14.743
- You watched somebody rob a bank?

00:01:14.743 --> 00:01:16.583
- [Complacent Man] Well
yeah, I could've stopped 'em

00:01:16.583 --> 00:01:19.874
but I gotta all that Krav Maga and shit.

00:01:19.874 --> 00:01:21.609
It's a lotta work.

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:23.037
- Hey, uh, Complacent?

00:01:23.037 --> 00:01:24.825
Do you play a lot of multiplayer games?

00:01:24.825 --> 00:01:26.583
- Oh sure, I'm all over it.

00:01:26.583 --> 00:01:28.864
I've watched loads of people play.

00:01:28.864 --> 00:01:29.697
- You've watched,

00:01:29.697 --> 00:01:31.023
you've watched 'em.
- But you haven't actually.

00:01:31.023 --> 00:01:33.838
- Well it's a lot of
energy to push everything.

00:01:33.838 --> 00:01:35.771
- We got a game so get ready here guys.

00:01:35.771 --> 00:01:36.734
Listen, here are the rules.

00:01:36.734 --> 00:01:38.017
Complacent, you haven't
played with us before

00:01:38.017 --> 00:01:40.182
so I'm gonna run through them
real quick like with you.

00:01:40.182 --> 00:01:42.817
No shotguns. No camping. No superpowers.

00:01:42.817 --> 00:01:45.237
- I'm gonna have a great
time with my friends.

00:01:45.237 --> 00:01:46.624
(both groaning and mumbling)

00:01:46.624 --> 00:01:48.255
- Let's play.

00:01:48.255 --> 00:01:49.596
(gunfire)

00:01:49.596 --> 00:01:51.842
- I'm kind of (farts)
shitting myself right now

00:01:51.842 --> 00:01:53.328
I mean literally. (farts)

00:01:53.328 --> 00:01:55.180
- The best part of playing
this, I swear to God,

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.151
is that we can legally kill people.

00:01:58.151 --> 00:01:58.984
Especially teenagers.

00:01:58.984 --> 00:02:00.942
- Where are you jerks?

00:02:00.942 --> 00:02:02.470
Trying to locate you.

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:03.303
- [Complacent] Oh, right.

00:02:03.303 --> 00:02:04.706
- [Lighting] On your six,
on your four, on your five,

00:02:04.706 --> 00:02:07.255
on your eight, on your
seven, on your nine.

00:02:07.255 --> 00:02:08.483
Stop moving!

00:02:08.483 --> 00:02:11.075
- [Complacent] I just
threw a grenade at a bench.

00:02:11.075 --> 00:02:12.040
That's cool.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.274
- Okay, um. You can throw those at people,

00:02:14.274 --> 00:02:15.784
it'd be pretty rewarding.

00:02:15.784 --> 00:02:17.184
- Ah! Murder!

00:02:17.184 --> 00:02:18.483
Damnit.

00:02:18.483 --> 00:02:20.877
- Is it just me or do any of you get laid

00:02:20.877 --> 00:02:21.937
from saving people?

00:02:21.937 --> 00:02:24.723
- Oh I just shot a trash can.

00:02:24.723 --> 00:02:28.699
- I do like every half hour,
every 45 minutes or so.

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:29.534
- Really?

00:02:29.534 --> 00:02:32.441
- Yeah the issue is I come too quick.

00:02:32.441 --> 00:02:36.166
It's the curse of the
whole lightening thing.

00:02:36.166 --> 00:02:38.821
- You're killing my buzz, to be honest.

00:02:38.821 --> 00:02:41.327
- I'm really horny but not really.

00:02:41.327 --> 00:02:45.201
- Guys I, you know, just maybe
you can learn by example,

00:02:45.201 --> 00:02:47.146
I just killed a guy
with a rocket launcher.

00:02:47.146 --> 00:02:48.778
Got us 100 points.

00:02:48.778 --> 00:02:51.379
Uh, hey Complacent I think
if you would try something

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:53.348
a little, you know, more similar to that,

00:02:53.348 --> 00:02:54.972
you'd feel great about how you did.

00:02:54.972 --> 00:02:57.363
- Oh. I know everything.

00:02:57.363 --> 00:02:59.626
- I'm not saying I know everything.

00:02:59.626 --> 00:03:01.629
- How do you press the button... so hard?

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:04.264
- You just, you apply a little
bit of pressure with your

00:03:04.264 --> 00:03:05.551
finger, come on man.

00:03:05.551 --> 00:03:07.336
Get your fuckin' head in the game.

00:03:07.336 --> 00:03:08.699
- Ok button,

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:09.810
you have 3 seconds.
- How do you press the button?

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.291
(laughing)

00:03:11.291 --> 00:03:13.168
- Three seconds, button.
- Can we get anyone else?

00:03:13.168 --> 00:03:14.237
Can we get anyone else?

00:03:14.237 --> 00:03:15.911
I'm sorry to not be chill.
- Wow, wow, wow.

00:03:15.911 --> 00:03:17.696
- Oh, wow.
- Can we get Professor Dog?

00:03:17.696 --> 00:03:19.404
- I'm dead again.

00:03:19.404 --> 00:03:21.071
- Ahhh icicle storm!

00:03:23.124 --> 00:03:25.093
- [Complacent] Cold in here.

00:03:25.093 --> 00:03:26.448
- [Flashback] Hey we won!

00:03:26.448 --> 00:03:28.300
(burps) Yeah, I'm gonna go jerk off.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.800
(upbeat electronic music)

00:03:32.853 --> 00:03:35.770
(pixelated noises)

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.370
(upbeat electronic music)
