00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:05.230
The Joe Rogan experience. Will, is the man behind anatomy of the fighter.

2
00:00:05.231 --> 00:00:08.080
If you ever seen any of those videos,

3
00:00:08.081 --> 00:00:12.550
like particularly the most famous one was when Conor McGregor threw that Dolly

4
00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:13.960
at the bus with Khabib.

5
00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:16.990
Norma Madoff was on it and it became a huge part of the promotion,

6
00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.640
which I thought was weird that it was this shameful act, right.

7
00:00:21.641 --> 00:00:22.331
That he did that.

8
00:00:22.331 --> 00:00:27.010
I mean it really awful cut a bunch of innocent people that were on the bus,

9
00:00:27.011 --> 00:00:29.980
but they use it over and over and over again. That was your foot.

10
00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.170
A lot of people didn't even know, including me.

11
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.960
<v 1>No one did. Um, you know, I was telling a friend of the day, what's funny,</v>

12
00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:39.020
no one has ever heard this. But when it happened, uh,

13
00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.530
I show could beep at the back of the bus cause he was,

14
00:00:42.531 --> 00:00:46.400
had a smile on his face and I showed him and everybody else on the bus that I

15
00:00:46.401 --> 00:00:49.340
actually caught Connor doing it cause they didn't really know it was Connor.

16
00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.340
So I remember it could be looked at the footage.

17
00:00:52.341 --> 00:00:56.900
I was holding the camera and he was like, brother, you can get paid from this.

18
00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.250
It's like, Bro, this is worth $100,000. He looked at his manager, Ali, uh,

19
00:01:01.251 --> 00:01:04.640
shout out to ivy and he was like, get this, get him, give him some money.

20
00:01:04.641 --> 00:01:09.410
He deserves this. And then I gave it to the UFC to use for embedded and um,

21
00:01:09.411 --> 00:01:13.400
I thought it was that was just sit and they promoted the fight with it and I was

22
00:01:13.401 --> 00:01:13.851
like, damn,

23
00:01:13.851 --> 00:01:17.780
I should've just leaned my head to the right and got hit by the Dolly so I not

24
00:01:17.781 --> 00:01:20.600
have to be doing it a, you know, a go fund me's and Shit.

25
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.930
<v 0>This is the thing that drives me crazy. Saved you believe something, right.</v>

26
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.760
And then if you go online and you read something else and that something else is

27
00:01:29.761 --> 00:01:32.670
contrary to what you believe and you start believing in that something else

28
00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.100
somehow or another, that's bad.

29
00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.190
This is one of the great arguments against censorship is like you have to figure

30
00:01:41.191 --> 00:01:43.110
out what the fuck makes sense.

31
00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:46.770
The only way to figure out what makes sense is to read all kinds of things,

32
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.890
to engage with all kinds of content.

33
00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.940
The idea that we're supposed to protect people because we know what's right.

34
00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.770
We know what's correct. Well, who are you? Let me, let me talk to you.

35
00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.270
Have you think you know what's correct?

36
00:02:00.271 --> 00:02:02.850
You're the arbiter of free speech or the arbitrage of, of,

37
00:02:02.851 --> 00:02:06.180
of logical discourse and and common sense in this world.

38
00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.000
Let me ask you things. Let me talk to you.

39
00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.770
Let me get to the heart of how you feel.

40
00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.310
How do you feel about trans kids transitioning when they're six?

41
00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.290
How do you feel about all sorts of crazy weird things that have just been

42
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.760
propped up as logical and makes sense? How do you, how do you feel about war?

43
00:02:23.761 --> 00:02:28.500
How do you feel about abortion? How do you feel about ghosts? How, who are you?

44
00:02:28.501 --> 00:02:29.910
Who are you and you just,

45
00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.120
you just get to choose whether or not someone lean or information that comes to

46
00:02:35.281 --> 00:02:37.920
them leans left or right. I think it's preposterous.

47
00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:43.190
I just think it's incredibly dangerous because you have to have an unbelievably

48
00:02:43.201 --> 00:02:48.201
complex and nuanced perspective in order to be able to dictate what makes or

49
00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.830
does not make sense. And you,

50
00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.980
you have to have a lot of information at your disposal. You have to have a lot.

51
00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.110
If you're talking about something like Venezuela,

52
00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.590
let's look at that for example,

53
00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.720
look at what you know and then look what you see in what you would call

54
00:03:04.721 --> 00:03:07.270
progressive, left wing media.

55
00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.390
That to your knowledge is incorrect and is basically propaganda points that's

56
00:03:12.581 --> 00:03:15.820
being redistributed in this way that is palatable.

57
00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:21.270
Now imagine if the people decide that you Abby Martin or somehow or another part

58
00:03:21.461 --> 00:03:23.850
of some right wing conspiracy now and they,

59
00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.730
they're going to sensor your voice and Sensor Europe because it doesn't fit in

60
00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:29.100
to this narrative that there,

61
00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.290
but because you need so much information to be able to really understand what's

62
00:03:35.051 --> 00:03:39.160
happening in this one part of south South America. That word, right. Exactly.

63
00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:40.300
It's so complex.

64
00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.380
<v 2>Well, they treat us like children. Um,</v>

65
00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.920
and they think that we're not smart enough to actually discern what is, um,

66
00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:51.020
information that we need. And I mean, I want the Russian perspective.

67
00:03:51.021 --> 00:03:52.460
I want the Venice right in perspective.

68
00:03:52.461 --> 00:03:55.580
I want the Chinese perspective because I feel like we're smart enough to really

69
00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.200
determine our own reality based on all the available information.

70
00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:00.360
<v 0>Well, this is where we're fucked,</v>

71
00:04:00.361 --> 00:04:05.361
is that we don't have a reliable independent source that's not filled with

72
00:04:06.211 --> 00:04:09.200
hyperbole and emotion and, and,

73
00:04:09.201 --> 00:04:12.510
and dunking on people and screaming and insulting.

74
00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:18.050
And I want someone who can break things down logically and clearly with no

75
00:04:18.931 --> 00:04:23.730
ideological bend. They, you're not leaning left, you're not leaning right. What,

76
00:04:23.731 --> 00:04:26.010
where is that and why? Why doesn't that exist?

77
00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.020
<v 2>Because it's not necessarily human. And, and you know,</v>

78
00:04:30.021 --> 00:04:33.950
people have opinions and they have biases and either they couch those biases in

79
00:04:33.951 --> 00:04:36.770
like these think tanks and pretend like they're these unbiased journalists.

80
00:04:36.771 --> 00:04:40.480
Or are they just kind of wear it on their sleeve? Like I do, um,

81
00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.130
with empire files and media roots, which is my, you know,

82
00:04:43.131 --> 00:04:47.270
my news organization that I do with my brother Robbie, but I mean,

83
00:04:47.271 --> 00:04:50.210
we tried to lay it out, but we also don't hide where we're coming from.

84
00:04:50.211 --> 00:04:53.600
I almost appreciate that more than, than a lot of these journalists,

85
00:04:53.601 --> 00:04:57.170
so-called journalists who are really kind of stenographers who pretend like they

86
00:04:57.171 --> 00:04:59.690
are unbiased and they're like, I'm just giving it to you straight.

87
00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.120
And at the end of the day, they're, they're really not,

88
00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:05.900
they're trying to toe a line and they're trying to push a certain perspective,

89
00:05:05.901 --> 00:05:07.700
but it's just not obvious. Yeah.

90
00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.180
<v 3>That guy a in San Diego,</v>

91
00:05:11.181 --> 00:05:14.870
I was telling you about the a a man threw sandals at me this weekend at my show.

92
00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.190
Yeah. What happened is we called them sandals Steve. So, uh, this is the most,

93
00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.940
there's two embarrassing parts of, of this story for this man. The show,

94
00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:26.510
the Sunday show was fucking phenomenal in San Diego. It was so fucking dope.

95
00:05:26.511 --> 00:05:30.110
We sold out the weekend and then Sunday show was incredible.

96
00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.350
Everyone's having a good time. I'm joking around at the end of my show,

97
00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:37.460
very end about people in San Diego think wearing sandals with jeans as

98
00:05:37.461 --> 00:05:40.010
appropriate. And I was like, that's just that San Diego.

99
00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:41.600
It's like buttoned down, but I have sandals on.

100
00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:45.620
It's like douchebags fucking have their toes out but wear like pants and some

101
00:05:45.621 --> 00:05:48.350
guys are gay. I'm like, let me guess you're wearing jeans with sandals.

102
00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.710
And he put, brings up a sandal. And I'm like, Myra Sandals, Steve Sound Caesar.

103
00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.520
But, and he goes, my name is Steve. And I was like,

104
00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:58.190
this fucking guy is fucking guys you this set. No.

105
00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:01.480
And I fucking wish I was the only one. I didn't fucking record course.

106
00:06:01.481 --> 00:06:05.570
That's the universe coursing. So, so, so, so I turned to the,

107
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:08.690
I turned to the left and this dude throws a fucking,

108
00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.820
I see it on the corner of my eye. Oh my God.

109
00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:14.270
But when the Sandal hit the curtain, uh, actually, and the lawyer,

110
00:06:14.271 --> 00:06:16.370
they have the old comedy store sign. Do you know that they bought,

111
00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:20.540
they brought that down. The old neon had the old neon. Now it hit the neon.

112
00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:25.340
And I was like, dude, what the fuck was that shit? And it kind of, you know,

113
00:06:25.341 --> 00:06:26.600
when something doesn't register, cause I was like,

114
00:06:26.601 --> 00:06:29.450
no way that if you broke the neo dude, bro murder.

115
00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:33.200
So I turn and then as I'm turning another sandal gets tossed on stage,

116
00:06:33.201 --> 00:06:37.080
not throwing, but like tossed. And I immediately, I was like, wait,

117
00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:40.220
what the fuck? And he's going like this bro.

118
00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:44.150
And that fuck staff is coming up and grabbing this fucking moron.

119
00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:47.750
And two dudes are standing up in the audience, you're ready to like swing.

120
00:06:47.751 --> 00:06:51.080
Like people were like, it was a commotion. And I was like, what the fuck?

121
00:06:51.081 --> 00:06:53.060
And he goes, I'm just shooting around. We couldn't run. And they were like,

122
00:06:53.061 --> 00:06:56.210
get the fuck out dude. And he goes, come on man, I'm a big fan. I go, dude,

123
00:06:56.211 --> 00:06:59.420
get the fuck out. You can't throw shit at me. Get the fuck out of here.

124
00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:00.740
So they removed the dude.

125
00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:05.420
But the best part or the most unfortunate part is it's his daughter's 21st

126
00:07:05.421 --> 00:07:08.600
birthday and she's a big Fan, right?

127
00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:14.080
Your shithead dad threw sandals at your fucking so of course if she's listening,

128
00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:16.670
I love you. Thanks for being a fan.

129
00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:20.990
Sorry your dad is a fucking moron and threw his sandals at us cause that's how

130
00:07:20.991 --> 00:07:24.290
you get kicked out dude. He threw them at my fucking head.

131
00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:29.090
[inaudible] missed my head by like a foot and he thinks I'm just kidding around

132
00:07:29.091 --> 00:07:31.100
like no dude, it is not funny. You don't throw sand,

133
00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:33.890
you can't throw sandals that Pete, you can can't throw shit at people.

134
00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:35.960
You can't throw shit and the poor girl man,

135
00:07:35.961 --> 00:07:38.690
I've never seen someone so embarrassed she was getting her purse and shit and

136
00:07:38.691 --> 00:07:39.524
she's like,

137
00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:43.580
you're like wavering through the crowd and the sun is like can I get back as

138
00:07:43.581 --> 00:07:47.150
sandals? And I was like get the fuck out. It doesn't usually happen.

139
00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:50.450
Someones rare, rare. You've got to, you've got to do some dumb shit.

140
00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:51.470
It does happen.

141
00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:56.710
<v 4>No Dog Yoga community has went from, hey,</v>

142
00:07:56.740 --> 00:08:01.540
check out my Bakasana to check out my backside in. These are the pants,

143
00:08:01.541 --> 00:08:05.410
right? A lot of yoga pants, pics, boody foodie booty.

144
00:08:05.411 --> 00:08:10.240
Just booty alone is an industry. It is a giant industry. It's the grant. Yeah.

145
00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:13.420
So what happens is you, you wake up in the morning,

146
00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:17.920
you check your notifications, then your homie tags you. Oh, look at this chick,

147
00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:21.340
the poem right now you have an erection. What's the first thing you do?

148
00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:25.210
You like, ah, let me go to my browser, open incognito browser and hit pornhub.

149
00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:28.270
Boom. Now you outta here. Right now your day's done.

150
00:08:28.271 --> 00:08:30.190
You just depleted area energy. Right?

151
00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:32.410
And this coming out of my book where I talk about, you know,

152
00:08:32.411 --> 00:08:34.640
why you sent her golf and all that stuff, but you right,

153
00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:39.580
that you shouldn't jerk off. Yeah. Never a well, there's a calculation.

154
00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:45.790
You have a jerk-off algorithm yet as a jerk off algorithm. Uh,

155
00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:49.540
it's created by the tower, the tower, Sta sexology.

156
00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:53.350
And I think it's your age times two.

157
00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:57.600
Know your age divided by times 100. I forget what it is. It's in my book.

158
00:08:57.601 --> 00:09:00.600
I can't remember it. Uh, but I got it from the Tao. Right.

159
00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:04.680
Which is why I don't have it memorized. Time Point eight times, 0.2 things.

160
00:09:04.681 --> 00:09:09.120
H Times 0.2. Um, and then it tells you how many days. Right?

161
00:09:09.121 --> 00:09:11.970
So at my age, I'm 38 now my age,

162
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.860
it's about seven and a half days between ejaculation to mean to maintain who I

163
00:09:16.861 --> 00:09:20.460
am. Really? Yeah. And Am yes.

164
00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:24.240
So a man strength is his balls. Right? Right.

165
00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:27.390
So every time you deplete yourself, you're not the same man anymore.

166
00:09:27.391 --> 00:09:31.020
You lose your superpowers. Now,

167
00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:36.210
when you lose your superpowers to some, you know, ige model,

168
00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:37.800
it's not even worthy.

169
00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:42.810
Your orgasm doesn't feel the same as a natural interaction with a woman.

170
00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:46.790
Right. You know what I mean? True. So you're, you're wasting your superpower on,

171
00:09:46.791 --> 00:09:49.170
on, on like a fictional fantasy.

172
00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:52.650
So you're wasting a percentage of your vital energy.

173
00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:56.550
You're your vital energy as well as the proteins and minerals and zinc and

174
00:09:56.551 --> 00:09:59.910
magnesium and all that stuff that you know is lost. Yeah.

175
00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:02.940
I think it's equivalent to like two New York strip steaks, eggs,

176
00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:07.110
oranges and apples or something like that. Really? Oh yes. A lot of vitamins.

177
00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:09.830
That's why I have a one on the size of the loads you shoot though. No. Oh, yeah.

178
00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:15.780
Yeah. That's why ladies should swallow. Whoa.

179
00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:17.220
Jesus ladies. I'm sorry.

180
00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:21.420
That's why you should ingest it.

181
00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:26.880
If the man is healthy because it's a, it's a full meal. It's a full meal.

182
00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:32.010
It's a full meal of nutrients that a man loses a bioavailable that way.

183
00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:35.820
I wonder if anyone has done studies. I'm sure they have.

184
00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:38.640
I bet people who've done like nutrition slash load studies,

185
00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:41.080
probably a startup out there like trying to do this right now,

186
00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:42.240
like calculate it into an app.

187
00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:52.050
<v 5>[inaudible].</v>
