00:00:00.374 --> 00:00:02.290
What I want to do in
this video is really make

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:05.200
some clarifications and go
a little bit more in detail

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.970
about the different
layers of the earth.

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.590
So let me draw a cross-section
of the earth over here.

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:13.767
And I'll try to do it.

00:00:13.767 --> 00:00:15.600
I won't be able to do
it perfectly to scale,

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.190
but I'll try to do a little
bit better job at giving you

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:21.740
a little bit of a sense of
how thick these layers are.

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.390
So let's say that this
is the crust up here.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.300
And I'm going to make
the continental crust

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.690
a little bit thicker.

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:29.600
So let's say that that
is continental crust

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.080
and this is continental crust.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.990
And then in between, let me
put some oceanic crust, which

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:38.410
is going to be thinner.

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.380
Actually, let me do that
in a different color.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.410
Let me do the oceanic
crust in blue.

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:43.420
But this isn't water.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:44.235
This is rock.

00:00:44.235 --> 00:00:45.110
I'll do it in purple.

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:46.146
That's even better.

00:00:46.146 --> 00:00:47.520
I don't want it
to be that thick.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.920
So let me draw the
oceanic crust-- is thinner

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.340
than the continental
crust, which

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.860
I'm trying to depict
right over here.

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:01.540
So this right over
here is oceanic crust,

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.185
and up here is
continental crust.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.450
And the thickness, or how
deep you can go and still

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.170
be in crust, it depends
on where you are.

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.830
And we know that near hot spots,
the oceanic crust can actually

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.240
thin out a good bit.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.420
But roughly, when we
talk about the crust,

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:24.920
we're talking about
something that's

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.990
30 to 60 kilometers deep.

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.740
So 30 to 60 kilometers deep.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.820
So if you are on
a continent, which

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.540
I'm assuming you are, and
you dig for 20 kilometers,

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.860
you will still be in the crust.

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.020
30 kilometers, probably
still in the crust.

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.630
If you dig for 70 kilometers
or 100 kilometers,

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.482
you will probably
reach the mantle.

00:01:46.482 --> 00:01:48.190
And remember, what
we're describing here,

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.054
when we talk about the crust,
the mantle, and the core,

00:01:51.054 --> 00:01:52.720
we're talking about
the chemical makeup.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:53.600
Let me make this clear.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.266
We're talking about
the chemical makeup.

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.460
The crust is fundamentally
different than the mantle based

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.430
on the molecules that
it is made up of,

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.040
based on its composition.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.500
So let's talk about
the mantle now.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.120
So the mantle, layer like this.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.840
And once again, this is not
to scale because the crust,

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.057
we're talking about
30 to 60 kilometers.

00:02:16.057 --> 00:02:17.890
The mantle, we're talking
about on the order

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.650
about 2,900 or 3,000
kilometers thick.

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.280
So this right here
is the entire mantle.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.780
So that's the mantle.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:34.980
And this is 2,900 to
3,000 kilometers thick.

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.582
So this isn't even 1/30 of that.

00:02:37.582 --> 00:02:39.790
So I would have to draw it
even narrower than the way

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:40.790
I've drawn it over here.

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.220
And the mantle itself
can be subdivided

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.250
into the upper mantle
and the lower mantle.

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.010
So let me draw this
division right over here.

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.020
The upper mantle, and
there's different ways

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.240
to define the boundary.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.744
The upper mantle is roughly
about 700 kilometers down.

00:02:58.744 --> 00:02:59.910
So these are huge distances.

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.030
I mean, this is
going straight down.

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.300
So this is the upper mantle.

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.860
Let me write it on the
actual mantle here.

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.280
This is the upper mantle,
and this over here

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.360
is the lower mantle.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.210
And just to be clear on things.

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:18.530
So the crust is solid.

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.240
Now when you go into
the upper mantle,

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.412
the upper part of the
upper mantle-- and we'll

00:03:23.412 --> 00:03:24.870
talk about that a
little bit more--

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.120
is cool enough to be solid.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.730
So there is a solid portion
of the upper mantle.

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.080
So all of this up here is
solid because it's cool enough.

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:41.310
It hasn't reached the melting
point of those rocks just yet.

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:42.970
And we learned in
previous videos

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.840
that the combination of the
solid part of the upper mantle

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.576
and the crust combined, we
call that the lithosphere.

00:03:50.576 --> 00:03:52.200
And when we talk
about the lithosphere,

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.116
we're not talking about
the mechanical makeup.

00:03:54.116 --> 00:03:56.870
We're not talking about what's
solid and what's not solid.

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:57.995
So this is the lithosphere.

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:02.520
You go a little bit deeper.

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.440
Right below the lithosphere,
now the temperatures

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.550
are high enough for-- and
I use the word liquid,

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:09.800
but that's not exactly right.

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.430
You can kind of think of it
as kind of a deformable solid,

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.040
or a plastic solid or a magma.

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.350
And that's the asthenosphere.

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:22.280
So this area right over
here, this area right

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.251
over here, the liquid
part-- actually, I

00:04:24.251 --> 00:04:25.500
shouldn't use the word liquid.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:26.590
Kind of deformable.

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.040
It deforms over long
periods of time.

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.630
But it is more fluid
than what we normally

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:34.940
associate with rock
magma, would be a good way

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:35.990
to think about it.

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.080
That's what we call
the asthenosphere.

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.146
It is fluid, just not
as fluid as water.

00:04:41.146 --> 00:04:43.020
It is more viscous than
something like water.

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.228
So this is the asthenosphere.

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.460
Now the upper mantle,
it's hot enough

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.760
for the rock to
melt and be fluid.

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.630
And the pressure is
low enough for it

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:59.880
to still be able to kind
of move past itself,

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.670
to still be somewhat fluid.

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:08.804
But then once you get even
deeper, into the lower mantle,

00:05:08.804 --> 00:05:09.845
you have higher pressure.

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:17.690
And so it's still fluid,
but it's less fluid.

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.300
It's kind of thicker--
I guess, is the best

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:23.800
way to think about it-- in the
lower mantle, it's thicker.

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.230
So this whole area over
here, you could kind of

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:27.930
think of it as melted rock.

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:29.050
It's fluid.

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:32.370
But the upper part of the
melted rock is more fluid.

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:35.319
It's able to move easier,
because there's less pressure.

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:37.860
And the pressure's just from
all of the rock that's above it.

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:41.130
Remember, gravity is
pulling down on everything.

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:44.550
Every molecule here wants to
go downward because of gravity.

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:46.870
So it's applying
pressure downward.

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:50.240
So the deeper you go, the
more pressure you get.

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.620
Now, when we get even deeper
than that, we get to the core,

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.770
and the core is divided
between the outer core

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:57.480
and the inner core.

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:04.260
So the outer core
and then, of course,

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:05.350
you have the inner core.

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:12.570
And just so we have a
sense for the distances,

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:15.330
the width or the thickness
of the outer core

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:18.351
is approximately
2,300 kilometers.

00:06:18.351 --> 00:06:20.850
So these are huge distances,
when you think about thickness.

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:22.660
You could go down
another 2,300 kilometers,

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:24.910
and you're in the-- or once
you go through the mantle,

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:27.056
you can go 2,300 kilometers
to the outer core.

00:06:27.056 --> 00:06:28.430
And then you're
in the inner core

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:29.690
and that essentially
takes you to the rest.

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:31.481
That's essentially the
center of the earth.

00:06:31.481 --> 00:06:34.500
And the inner core--
Maybe I should

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.620
draw the boundaries a
little bit more to scale.

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:37.610
Let me do it this way.

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:39.440
It should actually
look a little bit more

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:45.290
like this, because
the outer core

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:46.840
is thicker than the inner core.

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:51.470
So the outer core is, as
I said, let me rewrite it.

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:56.920
Outer core is on the order, it's
about 2,300 kilometers thick.

00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:00.060
And then you have
your inner core.

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:01.160
I shouldn't do it in blue.

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.720
I should do it in a hot color.

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:05.709
So the inner core
right over here

00:07:05.709 --> 00:07:07.750
just kind of takes us to
the center of the earth.

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:11.620
And that's a little over
1,000 kilometers thick.

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:14.510
So this is the inner core.

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:18.590
The number I have is about
1,200 kilometers thick.

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:21.900
And both the-- the entire
core, both the outer core

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:23.817
and the inner core, is
mainly nickel and iron.

00:07:23.817 --> 00:07:25.441
Think about when the
earth was forming.

00:07:25.441 --> 00:07:27.810
What happens is when this
whole earth was super hot

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:29.730
and was kind of
in a fluid state,

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:31.230
the heavier elements
were allowed

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:35.182
to sink down, when
everything was fluid.

00:07:35.182 --> 00:07:37.140
The things that were in
between would kind of--

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:38.850
or the things that were
lighter would go up.

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:40.560
And then the gases, things
that would naturally

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:42.280
be in the gaseous
state, would kind of

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:47.400
bubble up through that
fluid, kind of the way,

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:50.287
actually, carbon
bubbles up in a soda,

00:07:50.287 --> 00:07:52.120
it would eventually
bubble out of the fluid,

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:54.049
and it would actually
form the atmosphere.

00:07:54.049 --> 00:07:56.590
So that's why, when you look at
the composition of the earth,

00:07:56.590 --> 00:07:58.510
you have the densest,
the heaviest elements,

00:07:58.510 --> 00:07:59.460
at the center.

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:02.640
And then the lightest elements
are forming the atmosphere.

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:04.570
And the outer core and
the inner core, they

00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:07.225
are made up predominantly
of nickel and iron.

00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:13.250
And their makeup is
actually very similar.

00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:15.790
So this division--
Chemically, they

00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:17.980
have a very similar composition.

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:21.020
What's different about
them is at the outer core,

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:22.650
you have temperatures
high enough

00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:24.360
that nickel and iron can melt.

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:26.860
But the pressures are low
enough that they can still

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:28.610
be in a fluid state.

00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:33.169
So this is our
liquid outer core.

00:08:33.169 --> 00:08:36.000
And this has a
pretty low viscosity,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.220
especially even
relative to the mantle.

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:39.900
So that's why people
kind of consider

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:42.309
this in kind of a more
traditional liquid state.

00:08:42.309 --> 00:08:44.360
But as you get deeper
and deeper and deeper,

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:47.280
the pressure becomes
so huge as you

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:50.720
get to the inner core-- remember
all of the weight of all

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:53.610
of the rock above you, of these
thousands of miles of rock

00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:56.740
above you, is all pushing
down on the rock below it.

00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:59.140
So the inner core, even though
the temperature is really,

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:02.020
really, really hot,
the pressure is so big

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:04.550
that the molecules can't
flow past each other.

00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:05.840
They can't be liquid.

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:07.640
They're kind of jam-packed.

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:09.970
And so the inner core,
because of the high pressure,

00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:13.490
despite the high
temperature, is solid.

00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:14.104
It's solid.

00:09:14.104 --> 00:09:15.520
So the difference
here is actually

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:18.429
a mechanical one between the
outer core and the inner core.

00:09:18.429 --> 00:09:20.220
They're made up of the
same things, roughly

00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:21.290
the same chemical makeup.

00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:24.330
It's just slightly-- or
lower pressure on the outside

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:26.432
so you can actually
be in a fluid state.

00:09:26.432 --> 00:09:28.140
So hopefully that
clarifies and gives you

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:32.630
a little bit of depth on
the makeup of the earth.
