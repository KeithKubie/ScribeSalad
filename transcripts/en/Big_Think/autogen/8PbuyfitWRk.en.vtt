when we measure gravity in the universe

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240
when we measure gravity in the universe
 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.769

when we do this 85 percent has no known
 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.450
when we do this 85 percent has no known
origin so it's not a matter of whether

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460
origin so it's not a matter of whether
 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.580

it's matter it implies we know something

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100
it's matter it implies we know something
 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.600
it's matter it implies we know something
about it that we actually don't so a

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610
about it that we actually don't so a
 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.080
about it that we actually don't so a
more precise labeling for it would be

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090
more precise labeling for it would be
 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.950

no reference to what we think it is
 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.770
no reference to what we think it is
because in fact we have no idea so

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780
because in fact we have no idea so
 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:49.910
because in fact we have no idea so
here's how you actually measure the

manifests so you look how fast it's

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130
manifests so you look how fast it's
 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.719
manifests so you look how fast it's
rotating and we know from laws of

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729

you invoke that rotation rate in the

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510
you invoke that rotation rate in the
 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.349
you invoke that rotation rate in the
equation and out the other side says how

there attracting you and the more mass

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:26.879
there attracting you and the more mass
 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:28.670
there attracting you and the more mass
that's there the faster we expect you to

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680
that's there the faster we expect you to
 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.390
that's there the faster we expect you to
be orbiting that kind of makes sense so

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400
be orbiting that kind of makes sense so
 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.009

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.999
we're not even there now here's what's
interesting about dark matter we know it

00:04:46.999 --> 00:04:47.009
interesting about dark matter we know it
 

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:49.850
interesting about dark matter we know it
doesn't interact with us except

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860
doesn't interact with us except
 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.040
doesn't interact with us except
gravitationally by the way what do I

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050
gravitationally by the way what do I
 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.260
gravitationally by the way what do I
mean by interact does it bind and make

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270
mean by interact does it bind and make
 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.129
mean by interact does it bind and make
atoms and molecules and solid objects

00:04:57.129 --> 00:04:57.139
atoms and molecules and solid objects
 

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:00.820
atoms and molecules and solid objects
no it does not interact with us in any

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830
no it does not interact with us in any
 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:04.909
no it does not interact with us in any
important known way but it also doesn't

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:04.919
important known way but it also doesn't
 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:08.059
important known way but it also doesn't
interact with itself that's what's

00:05:08.059 --> 00:05:08.069
interact with itself that's what's
 

00:05:08.069 --> 00:05:10.939
interact with itself that's what's
interesting so if it interacted with

00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:10.949
interesting so if it interacted with
 

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:14.899
interesting so if it interacted with
itself you can imagine finding dark

00:05:14.899 --> 00:05:14.909
itself you can imagine finding dark
 

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:18.010
itself you can imagine finding dark
matter planets dark matter galaxies

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.020
matter planets dark matter galaxies
 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:20.269
matter planets dark matter galaxies
because to interact with yourself is

00:05:20.269 --> 00:05:20.279
because to interact with yourself is
 

00:05:20.279 --> 00:05:22.909
because to interact with yourself is
what allows you to accumulate and have a

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:22.919
what allows you to accumulate and have a
 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:24.890
what allows you to accumulate and have a
concentration of matter in one place

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:24.900
concentration of matter in one place
 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:29.059
concentration of matter in one place
versus another these are the atomic

00:05:29.059 --> 00:05:29.069
versus another these are the atomic
 

00:05:29.069 --> 00:05:31.309
versus another these are the atomic
bonds and the molecular bonds that

00:05:31.309 --> 00:05:31.319
bonds and the molecular bonds that
 

00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:37.579
bonds and the molecular bonds that
create solid objects and if particles do

00:05:37.579 --> 00:05:37.589
create solid objects and if particles do
 

00:05:37.589 --> 00:05:38.959
create solid objects and if particles do
not interact with one another they just

00:05:38.959 --> 00:05:38.969
not interact with one another they just
 

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:42.079
not interact with one another they just
pass through you just have this zone of

00:05:42.079 --> 00:05:42.089
pass through you just have this zone of
 

00:05:42.089 --> 00:05:45.800
pass through you just have this zone of
mass not really doing anything

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810
mass not really doing anything
 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:51.019
mass not really doing anything
interesting so dark matter not only

00:05:51.019 --> 00:05:51.029
interesting so dark matter not only
 

00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:53.420
interesting so dark matter not only
doesn't interact with us it doesn't

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:53.430
doesn't interact with us it doesn't
 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:55.850
doesn't interact with us it doesn't
interact with itself and that's why when

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:55.860
interact with itself and that's why when
 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.559
interact with itself and that's why when
we find dark matter across the universe

00:05:57.559 --> 00:05:57.569
we find dark matter across the universe
 

00:05:57.569 --> 00:06:02.950
we find dark matter across the universe
its varies diffusely spread out it's

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:02.960
its varies diffusely spread out it's
 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.889
its varies diffusely spread out it's
it's like over here it's not in this one

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:06.899
it's like over here it's not in this one
 

00:06:06.899 --> 00:06:08.779
it's like over here it's not in this one
spot and look at this concentration no

00:06:08.779 --> 00:06:08.789
spot and look at this concentration no
 

00:06:08.789 --> 00:06:12.469
spot and look at this concentration no
that's not how that works an example of

00:06:12.469 --> 00:06:12.479
that's not how that works an example of
 

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:15.079
that's not how that works an example of
this you know what is a rock it's an

00:06:15.079 --> 00:06:15.089
this you know what is a rock it's an
 

00:06:15.089 --> 00:06:16.999
this you know what is a rock it's an
it's a collection of atoms and molecules

00:06:16.999 --> 00:06:17.009
it's a collection of atoms and molecules
 

00:06:17.009 --> 00:06:23.079
it's a collection of atoms and molecules
that are stuck together by

00:06:23.079 --> 00:06:23.089
that are stuck together by
 

00:06:23.089 --> 00:06:25.399
that are stuck together by
electromagnetic forces we don't think of

00:06:25.399 --> 00:06:25.409
electromagnetic forces we don't think of
 

00:06:25.409 --> 00:06:26.059
electromagnetic forces we don't think of
them that way

00:06:26.059 --> 00:06:26.069
them that way
 

00:06:26.069 --> 00:06:28.820
them that way
we just think of them as rocks but they

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:28.830
we just think of them as rocks but they
 

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:32.149
we just think of them as rocks but they
are held together by forces on the

00:06:32.149 --> 00:06:32.159
are held together by forces on the
 

00:06:32.159 --> 00:06:36.260
are held together by forces on the
atomic and molecular scale and they bind

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:36.270
atomic and molecular scale and they bind
 

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:38.240
atomic and molecular scale and they bind
together and then we get what we call

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:38.250
together and then we get what we call
 

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:40.040
together and then we get what we call
this solid object called a rock

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:40.050
this solid object called a rock
 

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:41.940
this solid object called a rock
if those forces did

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:41.950
if those forces did
 

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:45.660
if those forces did
work on you as a particle you have no

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:45.670
work on you as a particle you have no
 

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:47.670
work on you as a particle you have no
occasion to bind with any other particle

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:47.680
occasion to bind with any other particle
 

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:51.240
occasion to bind with any other particle
you have no occasion you have no

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:51.250
you have no occasion you have no

you have no occasion you have no
ambitions of ever becoming a solid

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:53.830
ambitions of ever becoming a solid
 

00:06:53.830 --> 00:07:00.810
ambitions of ever becoming a solid
object it's a different kind of world

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:00.820
object it's a different kind of world
 

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:04.020
object it's a different kind of world
that would be we would not expect that

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:04.030
that would be we would not expect that
 

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:06.420
that would be we would not expect that
world to have life as we know it because

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:06.430
world to have life as we know it because
 

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:09.390
world to have life as we know it because
life requires an assembly of molecules

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:09.400
life requires an assembly of molecules
 

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:11.760
life requires an assembly of molecules
to turn it into some separate entity

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:11.770
to turn it into some separate entity
 

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:15.000
to turn it into some separate entity
distinct from everything else that then

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:15.010
distinct from everything else that then

has fascinating chemical properties that

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:16.780
has fascinating chemical properties that
 

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:19.230
