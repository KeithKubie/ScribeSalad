Speaker 1:          00:00          You're listening to radiolab radio from Wny, c. E. N. N. P. R. [inaudible]. Um, we are a church in a church. Oh, that's,

Speaker 2:          00:21          it's not usually where we start. We're in a church cathedral. Really? A huge cathedral in Upper Manhattan. Saint John, the divine got an Oregon. The preacher was preaching congregation of course. Couple thousand people in the pews. At least Jesus said, therefore your basic Sunday service, except today, you've also got, here it comes. The reason we begin here is because today the church is filled with dogs. I talked to you about your dog. Yeah. What's his or her name? His name is blizzard.

Speaker 1:          01:07          He's a Labrador and put Omex. Wow. I have legend who I just adopted in January. I have Jen pow

Speaker 2:          01:15          bell by the way. In more than dogs. You've got birds, Jessie. It's a choir now and now. Has this guy ever been blessed before? I don't think so. No. Just worn this year in hamsters. His name is Toby. Teddy toes. And if he'd come out you'd see why because he's really fat and all kinds of creatures. Got a little girl with a falcon in behind her. Oh, it's a giant, horrendous. This is the Saint Francis Day of the animacy yearly event coming toward us where people bring their animals to be blessed. Is it daunting? The folks that are gathered here and there is a little girl with a hermit crab. They don't think there's anything weird or inappropriate about this fact. If you ask them in here comes up

Speaker 1:          02:00          both, here's what they say. I don't know if it means anything to her, but it means a to me cause you know you want to baptize your babies and this is more or less the same kind of thing. And what does it, what does it mean to you? It just means when, when she finally does go away, she's gonna go to heaven. What kind of parent it is? She called [inaudible]. Don't put your hand near his face if he wants. When you chuckle, struggle. Do you feel like he has a, a soul or an inner life of some sort? It's a thinking being there. They're as smart as we are. Really? Andrew? Okay. Yeah. Since you invited me here. I didn't want to be impolite or anything. Say what you gotta say. Well, okay. These people of course, they love their animals. Sure. Yeah. Can you hear that? Because when I'm feeling sad comes in the bed and he lays down spine to spine with me and he just didn't leave my side. The using a little bit. The animals they love are going to feel like grace of the prayer or feels the blessing, which is a one which raises

Speaker 2:          03:00          a question. What do we really know about what goes on inside the animal's mind? Yeah. All those things that you might feel in a church. Grace, gratitude, uh, guilt. Can the animals feel those things too? How much can we share and can you measure it? Yeah. I'm Jad Abumrad I am Robert Krulwich. This is radio

Speaker 3:          03:35          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          03:37          and we will begin the hour with a story about an animal who would, I'm sure love to have been at the worship service, but it was, it was a very inconvenient thing. Didn't get eaten quite get there.

Speaker 4:          03:49          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          03:50          okay. Just to get things rolling. This is a story that we heard about [inaudible] who went off to talk about first from the following day. Is it or is it Mike [inaudible]? There's way too many mics around make men ago is his name. No here and a, we met recently at the Emeryville Marina, which is not far from San Francisco where he's got a boat called the super fish mix. Says he rents out for all kinds of things. Sure. Trips to ash gathering bachelor parties, fireworks watching. I got a little cardboard sign. I stand by the freeway. Just have boat need work. So yeah, that's mic. And our story begins one morning in December, probably eight o'clock in the morning or something. As I recall a few years back, Mick just kind of sitting at home. I was at home. Yeah, it was the middle of December. We didn't have any work, but then he gets this call. Hello, you got this call. There was the call relaying a message from a fishermen way out at sea, 18 miles maybe outside the golden gate bridge. They told me that there was a whale in trouble, tangle up in grabbed gear and it didn't appear to be able to move.

Speaker 2:          04:55          So after he hangs up and make immediately calls a few dive buddies,

Speaker 5:          04:59          Jim Yong, Kim young air force, Para rescue. And then uh, let's see, James Mosquito, James Mosquito national diver. I called them and said, hey, you know, here's the deal. Are you interested? It was a no brainer. I said, yeah, I'm in. Absolutely. I figured, all right, we're going. I packed up my stuff, grabbed my gear and I went directly to the boat and we left underneath the Golden Gate Bridge.

Speaker 3:          05:21          Nothing at the horizon in front of us. My name is Holly [inaudible]. I am James's significant tethered. We motored out for about two hours. Had to do less towards the means. What were you feeling when you're on the boat heading out? I didn't think we'd find it. I really didn't.

Speaker 2:          05:40          But about 18 miles off the coast, completely open water. One of the divers spots and crab buoys in the distance and some seagulls flying overhead. And as they got closer, [inaudible] saw the whale,

Speaker 5:          05:54          just the very top of the whale sticking up about maybe six inches out of the water at the surface, a tiny sliver of black. And that was it. I said, okay, we needed to see what's going on. So, uh,

Speaker 2:          06:06          so Tim and James Jump into an inflatable boat and they paddle about a couple of hundred feet from the way,

Speaker 5:          06:11          and it just wasn't happening. Every time that the swale came on up, it would just displace the boat back again. So it would push us back again. Not to mention the visibility in the water was just terrible. He couldn't even see down there to see, you know, what they were dealing with. And uh, you know what, sometimes plans have to change in, in mid flight.

Speaker 2:          06:29          So Tim and James Look at each other and without saying a word boom, we got out of the boat and slash

Speaker 6:          06:36          until the water and I see a shadow [inaudible] massive animal, a hazy silhouette. And we just started swimming

Speaker 3:          06:55          [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          06:55          to the whale about a hundred feet away. You know, parts of have blubber and skin floating around 35 feet,

Speaker 7:          07:06          20 feet, and then they see it.

Speaker 5:          07:11          My goodness, this thing's the size of a school bus.

Speaker 2:          07:14          A female humpback whale is one of the largest creatures on the planet, 50 feet long, 50 tons, and this particular whale was in a kind of c shape where its head was at the top of the water, but its tail was almost pointed directly down. It was almost like somebody was pulling her down by the tail to the bottom of the ocean.

Speaker 5:          07:34          Yeah, there was probably 20 crab traps, 2000 pounds at least just tied up to the tail. She had just become an anchor and to see her not be able to move that tail and a struggle, just like

Speaker 8:          07:48          the will was actually really laboring to breathe a little puff and there was just a rope

Speaker 5:          07:56          everywhere. It went around the whale's mouth, around the whales head across her eye, over her background, the pickup

Speaker 8:          08:03          Toro fins all way down to his tail. I thought there was no hope, there was no chance. We're looking at a dead well and the whale just doesn't know it yet.

Speaker 5:          08:13          But I knew that I had to try win a swim to the whale and as soon as I decided, okay, I'm going to swim to the whale. Well the whale decided she wasn't going to have that. What you do, she put up her pictorial fin, which is like her arm and this pictorial fins about 15 feet long. It's about four feet wide. And she just splashing down the water in front of me. This is the size of an airplane wing coming down on top of you, just inches from my head. So yeah, at that point I backed off and uh,

Speaker 2:          08:49          waited, waited for the whale to settle down. She was physically exhausted, which did, and then they both swim back. James goes to the tail and Tim, up to the wheels head, you know, I was there with a a six inch dive knife, cutting out line right near her eye, which was the size of a grapefruit.

Speaker 3:          09:09          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          09:10          hinge her, I was moving, keeping an eye on me. Really. Absolutely. He would go left or I would go left. He'd go right or I would go right. She was tracking me and all the wild. They're just cutting as much rope as they can.

Speaker 5:          09:26          You really had a saw at it. It was very strong, very tight. Sometimes I'd cut a rope and it would be a loose rope and all of a sudden something else would tighten up, which was a one rope that would let it all free. This whole process took hours,

Speaker 2:          09:43          but finally James gets to the end of ace at the tail sign his way through that big clump of line and he realizes at a certain point it to cut through all that line.

Speaker 5:          09:52          I'm going have to stab the whale to get my knife underneath the rope. Ah, it was that tight though. I a jagged my knife into the whale's tail and pull the rope and then cut it

Speaker 2:          10:03          and it wants the rope went

Speaker 3:          10:08          [inaudible].

Speaker 5:          10:08          It was a very surreal moment looking down and seeing the 20 crab traps and buoys

Speaker 2:          10:15          just disappear into the abyss.

Speaker 3:          10:26          [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          10:26          and just like that the whale was gone.

Speaker 5:          10:29          I'm spinning around going, where did she go? Where did she go?

Speaker 2:          10:33          But as the water settled, they realized they'd done it. They'd freed her.

Speaker 5:          10:38          As soon as they came up, I was like, Woo. Oh. Cooping it up and yelling. Unbelievable. I was

Speaker 2:          10:44          screaming, can you imagine now here's where the story takes a pretty startling turn. In fact, the whole reason we wanted to tell this story to begin with is for what happens next. So Tim and James and the other day was her in the water there celebrating, high fiving and then all of a sudden James looks down. Next thing I know I have this 50 ton whale coming right at me.

Speaker 5:          11:06          I'm thinking, oh my God, stop. I just stayed. Wait, so this whale is coming at you from below like jaws? Yeah, she's rising up towards me. Oh God. I was just thinking this is going to hurt

Speaker 3:          11:18          and like she was only inches away from my chest. [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          11:26          stopped

Speaker 9:          11:29          and

Speaker 2:          11:32          push me on the chest backwards and then released me and then kind of pushed again and then release and pushed again

Speaker 5:          11:45          and again. Wow. And then she swam up right next to me, picks her head up the water so that her eye was above the water and then came up and looked directly at me

Speaker 3:          12:01          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          12:01          and for what felt like 30 seconds. He says she just stared at him.

Speaker 5:          12:07          People didn't move around. She wasn't looking for anything else. She was just looking

Speaker 2:          12:12          at me.

Speaker 3:          12:13          Mm,

Speaker 5:          12:18          you're in the presence of something that great, makes you feel small. It really wasn't a very emotional feeling, you know, wasn't quite sure what to make out of it, make of it. But then he says she went off to the next dire, did the same thing. I remember distinctly how is 18 inches away from her eye. And she just looked at me and let me touch her and then swam off. Then she went off to the next diver and did the same thing. And the next person did the same thing one by one coming up right next to him, looking at him really good. And you'll inches away eyeballing them. Just swim around to every diver. All the guys got, yeah.

Speaker 10:         12:55          So it was about desk. Um, the water was glass flat. I was sitting at the helm of the boat just in awe and they had to leave the whale. She didn't want to leave them.

Speaker 1:          13:12          And this is a real question here. What exactly was that wheel doing or saying? Was she saying anything? If you asked James or Tim or Mike or any of the other divers,

Speaker 5:          13:24          we're in the water that day. They'll tell you. I felt this whale was really thanking us. I know it sounds crazy, but I could see the look in her eye, this mammal, this, this 50 ton mammal was literally saying things. Thanks for helping me out. And you know, I'll, I'll bring that to my grave knowing the gratification that I felt

Speaker 3:          14:01          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          14:01          wow. So what do you think we, here's the question really. Was that whale saying thank you? Was the whale thing? Well

Speaker 11:         14:09          I think the whale was saying something. I mean a whale. If she was just free to have her ups, I would think she would just go off and say, well I'm free. So the fact that she was, she hung around and make these specific eyeball visits, like, I don't know. I feel that she, there's something intentional about that. She did, she didn't leave anyone out right now. She went, in fact, according to them, one of the guys on the boat, she actually went to the boats and did the same thing to the boats. She said thank you to the boats. Yeah. Hm. Well then, so she was looking at the people, but she also thought the craft was, somebody should say that you or is I deal with, yeah, so maybe she was just site. Maybe she was just a,

Speaker 10:         14:46          yeah,

Speaker 11:         14:47          I really don't know what I mean. I don't, I don't feel completely comfortable just saying, of course I knew what I want to feel. Yeah, me too. But let's just try to straighten up for a second. We have a guy named Clive when his teaches at the university. Hello. Hey. Oh, hi. Is this Mr Clive when, yeah, this is live. When clover's within the psychology department of the University of Florida. Where am I taught? Here's this. This is Jad from a radio 11 right? Hijab. Clive also happens to be an expert on animal psychology. Hi, this is Robert also. Can you hear us pretty well? I can hear you pretty well. I'm, I'm, I'm wondering how well I'm going to distinguish your voices. No need to do that just as a unitary figure. Okay. Listen, let me, let me begin on this is Robert Talking. We'll tell you a story and we want to know what you think of the story. So once upon a time and not too long ago, we're going to fast forward a bit cause we ran Clive through the entire wheel story front to back crystal to you is if a diver said you, this whale said thank you to me, what would you say?

Speaker 12:         15:47          Well I would be put in a difficult situation because I don't doubt the, what these people experienced was a very moving moment with that whale. But the problem is I just don't speak whale so I don't know what thank you looks like in whale. If I'm going to be a cynic about it, I would say, well, the whale has been trapped for I believe, over a day and may just be disoriented.

Speaker 11:         16:15          Well, but this was, this was parking herself with one individual and then moving to the next. That's not a distracted. That looks like it's got some money intention.

Speaker 12:         16:23          It shows some interest in the individuals. I'll give you that, but how do we, how do we get from that too? Did you sing that the whale is trying to express things? What do you live with? Let's play a different example. Let's suppose that you found a bear in the woods that was caught up in some netting that ended up in the woods and you work for hours to free the bear and then the bat eats you. Does that mean that the bears are an ungrateful species of animal? Yes. No, I don't really believe it that. Right. Well, so, so I mean it would make as much sense to ascribe in gratitude to the bear as it does to ascribe gratitude to the whale. I just don't think that's a useful way of trying to understand animals. And I think it ultimately it demeans them because it means that instead of living in a world that's full of a diversity of wonderful creatures, each with its own ways of relating to other members of its own species and other members of other species, we say, well, we don't live in a world like that.

Speaker 12:         17:16          We live in a world that's basically a world of human beings. It doesn't matter. Some of these human beings have suits on some of these human beings weigh hundreds of tons of live under the ocean and can hold their breath for a very long time. None of that really matters. Ultimately, they're all basically like us and I just don't find that satisfying. Are you saying that you don't know if there's a possibility of sharing or that you don't think that there's a possibility of sharing at an emotional level between two species? Um, I don't doubt that there is the possibility of between two species. I mean you, I see it with dogs all the time, but I think it would be a mistake if we thought that the love we feel for our dogs is the same feeling that the dog has back to us. It, it has different qualities and it where you pet your dog wags his tail and it seems happy to see you.

Speaker 12:         18:04          Yeah. Do you just like not trust that well, okay, so let me make clear that I wear two hats when I'm talking about a dog, particularly a pet of my own. I'm where I have two possible hats I can wear and one is that when the dog pants back at me, I just hug the dog and you know, and let him kiss me. And that's, that's life with a dog. But if I'm, if I'm now wearing my scientific hat and getting my blanket as wet as I possibly can, then I ask myself, what do these behaviors mean among those?

Speaker 12:         18:35          That was a beautiful study that came out recently from Alexander Horevitz. I'm Alexandra Horowitz and I study dog cognition. Where do we find her? She's four. She's around the corner from you. She's at Barnard College. So we sent our producers, so we're in wheeler. Yup. That's me to meet her. And he ended up hanging out with her and her dog Finnegan in the park and snuffle that's nice stuff. She did this beautiful experiment that shows that um, when people think their dog is looking guilty, ears back, eyes lowered tail between the legs. Actually the dog is just being submissive.

Speaker 2:          19:15          So here's what she did. She tracked down a bunch of dog owners posted on craigslist and put out posters. And then she found a bunch of owners who believed that like most dog owners do that their dogs feel guilty. Yes, my dog feels guilty when he's done something wrong. And then she set up a situation where all of the dog owners had to scold their dogs because you know, they had been told that their dogs did something bad. But the trick of the experiment is that only half the dogs had done something.

Speaker 12:         19:39          Half the dogs had actually been naughty and half the dogs had not been naughty. But then she

Speaker 2:          19:45          misinformed the owners lied to half of the owners to the owners. So even the owners who just dogs hadn't been bad thought their dogs had been bad. So everybody scolded their dog and everyone did this the same way, which was to say no loudly to their dog and maybe put their hands on their hip and expressed as a credible yes can again, and again it's okay. See Finnegan just made the look even though he hadn't done anything wrong. And that's essentially what she found. Even the non guilty dogs made the guilty look.

Speaker 12:         20:18          It didn't matter whether the dog had transgressed or not. All that mattered was whether it was being chastised by its owner.

Speaker 2:          20:24          So bad dog, bad dog, right? That creates the look, not the deed. That's exactly right. But, but for me, the pivotal question here is not whether or not they all had the look, but what's attached to that? Look what feeling in the dog is attached to that guilty look. Maybe the dogs who were falsely accused still felt bad.

Speaker 12:         20:45          Well maybe they did. Maybe they

Speaker 2:          20:48          didn't have. Maybe there are angels on top of this control console here.

Speaker 3:          21:12          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          21:13          I thought it was a perfectly valid question. We should think, uh, Alexander Horowitz, her latest book is called inside of $8

Speaker 3:          21:25          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          21:25          and before we end this section, I have we resolved the question of what was that whale doing with those people? Was she saying thank you or no? No. And do we ever resolve any questions at all? Well, we try. We give a little closer to them. No, we have not resolved five. We will try harder. But, but, but, but in our snack section, a mere 70 seconds away, we will try very hard to actually get scientific about it. Good.
