00:00:14.507 --> 00:00:16.852
Why do we cringe
when we hear "Shakespeare?"

00:00:16.876 --> 00:00:19.914
If you ask me, it's usually
because of his words.

00:00:19.938 --> 00:00:23.006
All those thines and thous and therefores

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:26.802
and wherefore-art-thous
can be more than a little annoying.

00:00:26.826 --> 00:00:30.298
But you have to wonder,
why is he so popular?

00:00:30.322 --> 00:00:34.534
Why have his plays been made and remade
more than any other playwright?

00:00:35.393 --> 00:00:36.874
It's because of his words.

00:00:37.712 --> 00:00:40.745
Back in the late 1500s and early 1600s,

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:43.528
that was the best tool that a person had,

00:00:43.552 --> 00:00:45.529
and there was a lot to talk about.

00:00:45.553 --> 00:00:48.560
However, most of it was pretty depressing.

00:00:48.584 --> 00:00:50.641
You know, with the Black Plague and all.

00:00:51.855 --> 00:00:54.622
Shakespeare does use a lot of words.

00:00:54.646 --> 00:00:58.868
One of his most impressive accomplishments
is his use of insults.

00:00:58.892 --> 00:01:01.674
They would unify the entire audience;

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:06.292
and no matter where you sat, you could
laugh at what was going on onstage.

00:01:06.315 --> 00:01:09.694
Words, specifically dialogue
in a drama setting,

00:01:09.718 --> 00:01:11.976
are used for many different reasons:

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.976
to set the mood of the scene,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.976
to give some more atmosphere
to the setting,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.320
and to develop relationships
between characters.

00:01:20.995 --> 00:01:24.708
Insults do this
in a very short and sharp way.

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:27.776
Let's first go to "Hamlet."

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.468
Right before this dialogue,

00:01:29.492 --> 00:01:33.801
Polonius is the father of Ophelia,
who is in love with Prince Hamlet.

00:01:34.703 --> 00:01:39.600
King Claudius is trying to figure out
why Prince Hamlet is acting so crazy

00:01:39.624 --> 00:01:42.253
since the king married
Prince Hamlet's mother.

00:01:42.277 --> 00:01:48.002
Polonius offers to use his daughter
to get information from Prince Hamlet.

00:01:48.026 --> 00:01:50.729
Then we go into Act II Scene 2.

00:01:50.753 --> 00:01:54.022
Polonius: "Do you know me, my lord?"

00:01:54.046 --> 00:01:58.176
Hamlet: "Excellent well.
You're a fishmonger."

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.022
Polonius: "Not I, my lord."

00:02:01.046 --> 00:02:03.987
Hamlet: "Then I would you
were so honest a man."

00:02:04.916 --> 00:02:08.037
Now, even if you did not know
what "fishmonger" meant,

00:02:08.061 --> 00:02:11.021
you can use some contextual clues.

00:02:11.045 --> 00:02:16.031
One: Polonius reacted
in a negative way, so it must be bad.

00:02:16.055 --> 00:02:19.468
Two: Fish smell bad, so it must be bad.

00:02:19.492 --> 00:02:23.914
And three: "monger"
just doesn't sound like a good word.

00:02:23.938 --> 00:02:26.160
So from not even knowing the meaning,

00:02:26.184 --> 00:02:28.976
you're beginning to construct
some characterization

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.976
of the relationship
between Hamlet and Polonius,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.976
which was not good.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.499
But if you dig some more, "fishmonger"
means a broker of some type,

00:02:38.523 --> 00:02:41.976
and in this setting,
would mean like a pimp,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.760
like Polonius is brokering out
his daughter for money,

00:02:45.784 --> 00:02:47.976
which he is doing for the king's favor.

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:52.560
This allows you to see that Hamlet
is not as crazy as he's claiming to be,

00:02:52.584 --> 00:02:56.604
and intensifies the animosity
between these two characters.

00:02:57.191 --> 00:02:58.745
Want another example?

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:03.668
"Romeo and Juliet" has some of the best
insults of any of Shakespeare's plays.

00:03:04.217 --> 00:03:05.976
It's a play about two gangs,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.806
and the star-crossed lovers
that take their own lives.

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.924
Well, with any fisticuffs

00:03:10.948 --> 00:03:13.776
you know that there is
some serious smack talk going on.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.576
And you are not disappointed.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.976
In Act I Scene 1, right from the get-go

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.622
we are shown the level
of distrust and hatred

00:03:20.646 --> 00:03:25.591
the members of the two families,
the Capulets and Montagues, meet.

00:03:25.615 --> 00:03:30.976
Gregory: "I will frown as I pass by,
and let them take it as they list."

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.389
Sampson: "Nay, as they dare,
I will bite my thumb at them,

00:03:35.413 --> 00:03:38.883
which is a disgrace
to them, if they bear it."

00:03:38.907 --> 00:03:40.976
Enter Abraham and Balthasar.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.778
Abraham: "Do you bite
your thumb at us, sir?"

00:03:44.802 --> 00:03:47.514
Sampson: "I do bite my thumb, sir."

00:03:47.538 --> 00:03:51.422
Abraham: "Do you bite
your thumb at us, sir?"

00:03:51.446 --> 00:03:55.786
Okay, so how does this development
help us understand mood or character?

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.976
Well, let's break it down to the insult.

00:03:58.792 --> 00:04:01.545
Biting your thumb today
may not seem like a big deal,

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:04.491
but Sampson says it is an insult to them.

00:04:04.515 --> 00:04:06.976
If they take it so, it must have been one.

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:09.976
This begins to show us
the level of animosity

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.346
between even the men
who work for the two Houses.

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.344
And you normally would not do
anything to someone

00:04:16.368 --> 00:04:18.699
unless you wanted
to provoke them into a fight,

00:04:18.723 --> 00:04:21.418
which is exactly what's about to happen.

00:04:21.865 --> 00:04:25.852
Looking deeper, biting your thumb
in the time in which the play was written

00:04:25.876 --> 00:04:28.394
is like giving someone the finger today.

00:04:29.058 --> 00:04:30.986
A pretty strong feeling comes with that,

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:33.976
so we now are beginning to feel
the tension in the scene.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.391
Later on in the scene, Tybalt,
from the House of the Capulets,

00:04:37.415 --> 00:04:40.976
lays a good one on Benvolio
from the House of the Montagues.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.618
Tybalt: "What, art thou drawn
among these heartless hinds?

00:04:46.642 --> 00:04:49.948
Turn thee, Benvolio,
and look upon thy death."

00:04:49.972 --> 00:04:54.471
Benvolio: "I do but keep the peace;
put up thy sword,

00:04:54.495 --> 00:04:56.976
or manage it to part these men with me."

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.099
Tybalt: "What, drawn and talk of peace!

00:05:00.123 --> 00:05:04.591
I hate the word, as I hate hell,
all Montagues, and thee.

00:05:04.615 --> 00:05:06.446
Have at thee, coward!"

00:05:07.986 --> 00:05:09.976
Okay, heartless hinds.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.549
We know that once again,
it's not a good thing.

00:05:13.573 --> 00:05:17.883
Both families hate each other,
and this is just adding fuel to the fire.

00:05:18.807 --> 00:05:20.714
But just how bad is this stinger?

00:05:20.738 --> 00:05:22.119
A heartless hind is a coward,

00:05:22.143 --> 00:05:26.864
and calling someone that in front
of his own men, and the rival family,

00:05:26.888 --> 00:05:28.509
means there's going to be a fight.

00:05:29.136 --> 00:05:30.976
Tybalt basically calls out Benvolio,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.976
and in order to keep his honor,
Benvolio has to fight.

00:05:35.299 --> 00:05:37.125
This dialogue gives us a good look

00:05:37.149 --> 00:05:39.899
at the characterization
between these two characters.

00:05:39.923 --> 00:05:43.402
Tybalt thinks that the Montagues
are nothing but cowardly dogs,

00:05:43.426 --> 00:05:45.354
and has no respect for them.

00:05:45.378 --> 00:05:48.881
Once again, adding dramatic
tension to the scene.

00:05:48.905 --> 00:05:50.897
Okay, now here's a spoiler alert.

00:05:50.921 --> 00:05:54.456
Tybalt's hotheadedness
and severe hatred of the Montagues

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:57.651
is what we literature people
call his hamartia,

00:05:57.675 --> 00:05:59.920
or what causes his downfall.

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:01.790
Oh, yes.

00:06:01.814 --> 00:06:04.287
He goes down at the hands of Romeo.

00:06:05.422 --> 00:06:09.501
So when you're looking at Shakespeare,
stop and look at the words,

00:06:09.525 --> 00:06:12.395
because they really are trying
to tell you something.
