00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060
compromise so that they could get paper
 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.229
compromise so that they could get paper
ballots now I hope that the entire

the criminality of these electronic

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709
the criminality of these electronic
 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.560
the criminality of these electronic
voting systems where you have no

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570
voting systems where you have no
 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.289

accountability no paper trail it leaves

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299
accountability no paper trail it leaves
 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:54.289
accountability no paper trail it leaves
suspect whether or not we truly have a

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299
suspect whether or not we truly have a
 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:56.360
suspect whether or not we truly have a
fair election and we love to point to

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370
fair election and we love to point to
 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:57.710

other countries oh they don't have fair

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720
other countries oh they don't have fair
 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.539
other countries oh they don't have fair
elections I got to tell you the United

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549
elections I got to tell you the United
 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:01.580
elections I got to tell you the United
States has not seen a fair election for

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590
States has not seen a fair election for
 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.160
States has not seen a fair election for
some time and so the only answer I think

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170
some time and so the only answer I think
 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.039
some time and so the only answer I think
technology can do it but these private

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049
technology can do it but these private
 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:09.740
technology can do it but these private
companies hold their software nobody can

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750
companies hold their software nobody can
 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.630
companies hold their software nobody can
really examine what's going on that's

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640
really examine what's going on that's
 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.060
really examine what's going on that's
it's ridiculous that public officials

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070
it's ridiculous that public officials
 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.160
it's ridiculous that public officials
would put up with that kind but they do

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170
would put up with that kind but they do
 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.340
would put up with that kind but they do
and so the only safe thing to do in the

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350
and so the only safe thing to do in the
 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.130
and so the only safe thing to do in the
08 election have paper ballots let

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140
08 election have paper ballots let
 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.370
08 election have paper ballots let
people vote that way and then when we

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380
people vote that way and then when we
 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.440
people vote that way and then when we
have a government that's prepared to

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450
have a government that's prepared to
 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.960
have a government that's prepared to
bring forth the technology in a fair

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970
bring forth the technology in a fair
 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.330
bring forth the technology in a fair
fashion then we could move to electronic

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340
fashion then we could move to electronic
 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.059
fashion then we could move to electronic
voting but right now I have no

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:35.069
voting but right now I have no
 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:37.460
voting but right now I have no
confidence that this government has the
