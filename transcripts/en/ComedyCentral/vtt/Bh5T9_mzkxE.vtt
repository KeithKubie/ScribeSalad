Uh, Ilana, why is there no 2:10
train to Bridgeport anywhere?

00:00:11.078 --> 00:00:12.713
I don't know--
I'm not a conductor.

00:00:14.781 --> 00:00:17.084
Ilana, these are
Amtrak tickets, dude.

00:00:17.117 --> 00:00:19.052
It only runs outta
Penn Station.

00:00:19.086 --> 00:00:20.120
Oh, gross.

00:00:20.153 --> 00:00:21.355
Alright, let's go,
come on.

00:00:22.656 --> 00:00:23.657
I-I can't run.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:24.892
I'm gonna sweat
off my concealer.

00:00:27.794 --> 00:00:29.129
Holy (bleep)!

Taxi!

00:00:39.206 --> 00:00:40.207
Taxi!

00:00:42.576 --> 00:00:43.544
It's been a whirlwind,
right?

00:00:43.577 --> 00:00:44.611
I know.

00:00:44.645 --> 00:00:46.780
Both been
having fun.
Yeah.

00:00:46.813 --> 00:00:49.283
Talked about
getting that dog.
Uh-huh.

00:00:49.316 --> 00:00:54.288
But, um, Penn
Station-I can't.

00:00:54.321 --> 00:00:56.123
It's disgusting.

00:00:56.156 --> 00:00:58.992
It's kind of a
deal-breaker for me.

00:00:59.026 --> 00:01:00.227
Okay, I'm confused.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.063
Maybe this is one of those
romantic New York City stories

00:01:03.096 --> 00:01:08.402
where you meet someone amazing,
and then... tragedy happens.

00:01:08.435 --> 00:01:11.271
And they're gone, and
you never see them again,

00:01:11.305 --> 00:01:13.073
and you wonder what they did
with their whole life.

Good luck, kid.

Oh, it's just
not meant to be.
