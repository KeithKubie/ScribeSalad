00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.070
 In Dostowski's book Crime and Punishment 

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:04.949
 His main character 

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:07.000
 Raskolnikov 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.059
 Decides that he will commit a crime and has a good case for the crime 

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:15.480
 Dostoyevsky, very good at this, is putting his characters in 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:22.120
 Ethical attitudes are very difficult, and give them a complete justification to follow (quest) ...... 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:40.160
 Follow the moral path they follow, as Raskolnikov is bankrupt and starving and wants to go to law school 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.500
 And his sister is about to 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:48.059
 To get herself a bit of prostitution by marrying a man who hates her, dislikes him, and has towards her committed 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.649
 Or such acts, he is trying to save his mother who also suffers under financial constraints 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:01:00.840
 He goes to the present to mortgage his broken possessions so that he can barely survive 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.839
 She has this nephew, I think he was her nephew 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:10.600
 He was not very smart, and was basically treated as a slave, and was appalling towards him. 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:18.820
 The current has this money that Raskolnikov badly needs him, thinking: Look !, I will just kill her. Why not the hell?!. 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.480
 I will take her money she does not do any good by any way originally, I will free her nephew who lives as a slave, 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:32.340
 She has all those people attached to her store charts, all that will happen is that the world will sacrifice a better place! 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:37.360
 The only thing that prevents me is the traditional moral cheese. 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.360
 And you know! Dostoevsky has a personality in crime and punishment 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.980
 For days, hours, days, and weeks, 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:53.200
 Strong imaginations about this rationality, about his attempt to justify 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:00.260
 Putting himself outside the law, so that he can commit this act, he says to himself 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:05.400
 Through the best of nihilistic arguments, that the only thing possible, which prevents him 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.640
 It is a moral concept of mating (religion) 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.559
 So Dostoevsky explores how he committed the crime and later of course, all the gates of hell are blooming because of 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.979
 That things necessarily do not become as you want, anyway it goes unpunished 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.490
 Well, he survives 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:23.729
 Technically because no one knows that he is the one who did it, but he does not survive by considering his personal conscience 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:30.150
 So the rest of the book explores it. Well, Dostoevsky, I think he was in crime and punishment though 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.880
 He explains the issue with a number of his books, he evaluates an articular point, and this kind of issues 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:42.660
 Which I think people who have not achieved these things especially 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.119
 Literally with its philosophical path, never wrestling with it, Dostoevsky said it explicitly 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:55.529
 If there is no God, if there is no higher value, say that if there is no lofty value, then you can do whatever you want. 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.290
 And that question is 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.929
 Check it out. And you see that I own 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.940
 So aborted! To move people like Sam Hars, that radical atheist, because they seem to believe 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.229
 That once human beings have abandoned their foundation 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.600
 In lofty values, that the forward-looking path is a kind of zero 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:22.979
 Rational, automatic, as if I do not understand it !, they believe 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:23.739
 this is 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:30.149
 It is the rational course! What irrationality in hell is to take exactly what I want from each of you whenever I want 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:35.729
 At every possible moment, is not this irrational ?, and why this 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:42.720
 More rational than our cooperation so that we can both collect a good time of it, I do not understand this! 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:49.889
 I mean, as if insane madness is irrational !, there is nothing irrational about it! 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:55.049
 It's a naked personal interest, how is this irrational ?, I do not understand it. 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.060
 Where is the path of rationality to the virtue of Cao! 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:04.289
 Why the hell does anyone take care of himself only, and the devil take the hindmost 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.140
 It is a fully coherent philosophy. 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:12.569
 And in fact a philosophy that you can establish in the world with a kind of material success if you want to do so. 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:20.840
 So I do not. I do not see, for me I think the universe that people like Dockins and Hares 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:26.640
 Dwellers, is severely conditioned by mythological preconceived assumptions. 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.280
 So that they take in the abstract 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:36.120
 The ethics that emerge from this are given, rationally recognized. And of course 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.140
 What Nietzsche noted as Dystoevsky, this note Nietzsche! 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:46.120
 You just do not understand it! The moral that you think is normative is the end result 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:52.780
 Of nesting within this amazingly long history, many of which are expressed in 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:05:00.280
 Legendary formations, you hold this !, you can not keep pro-active assumptions and just assume they are rational axioms. 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.580
 The rational .. 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.240
 To make a rational argument, start with a preliminary proposal 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:13.400
 Well, the proposal that underpins Western culture is that there is a "moral value" in ethics, 

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:18.600
 You can say that this is a transcendent morality represented in God, that is fine. 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.580
 You can even call it a moral diagnosis (making ethics an entity or a person) if you want to 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:27.400
 If you do not want to move to abstract space, I do not want to argue about the existence of a god 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:32.380
 I argue that the ethics that guide 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:34.370
 Our culture 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:40.750
 Based on the idea of ​​the existence of God, and that you can not only remove this idea and expect the survival of the thing (ethics) is not palpable 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.299
 Without institutional consolidation (without establishing the argument).
