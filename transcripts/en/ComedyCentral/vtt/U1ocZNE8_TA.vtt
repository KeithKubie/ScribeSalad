00:00:01.634 --> 00:00:04.204
(applauding)

00:00:04.204 --> 00:00:08.208 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Welcome back to a very
special episode of @Midnight.

00:00:08.208 --> 00:00:10.710
It is time to play 22 Fan Fic.

00:00:12.045 --> 00:00:14.681
(cheering)

00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:16.716
If some published books don't
contact enough grammar errors

00:00:16.716 --> 00:00:17.784
and threesomes for your taste.

00:00:17.784 --> 00:00:19.285
You might wanna try fan fiction.

00:00:19.285 --> 00:00:21.221 align:start size:94% position:6%
Believe it or not, there's
fan fiction of everyone

00:00:21.221 --> 00:00:22.722
on this stage right now.

00:00:22.722 --> 00:00:24.557
Here to help me with some
very special 22 Jump Street

00:00:24.557 --> 00:00:26.526
fan faction, stars
of 22 Jump Street,

00:00:26.526 --> 00:00:29.062
Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill.

00:00:29.062 --> 00:00:31.498
(applauding)

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.354
Shut up. Shut up.

00:00:54.354 --> 00:00:56.022
They're just people.

00:00:57.824 --> 00:00:58.992
Oh, thanks OK.

00:01:00.493 --> 00:01:01.728
OK thank you gentlemen.

00:01:01.728 --> 00:01:03.196
Thank you so much
for being here.

00:01:03.196 --> 00:01:04.831 align:start size:97% position:3%
You are classing up our
show and making it fancier.

00:01:04.831 --> 00:01:06.499
Are you guys ready to
hear some of the smut

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:09.936 align:start position:0%
that the weirdos of the
internet have written about you?

00:01:09.936 --> 00:01:10.770
- Yes.

00:01:12.172 --> 00:01:14.340
- Have you ever gone down
any of the fan fiction

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.909
rabbit holes before?

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:17.610
You didn't even know that
this was out there, OK.

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.545
This will be fun.

00:01:18.545 --> 00:01:20.513
First one, this is the game.

00:01:20.513 --> 00:01:21.981
You're gonna tell me if
this is fan fiction about

00:01:21.981 --> 00:01:23.383
Channing or Jonah.

00:01:23.383 --> 00:01:24.050 align:start size:97% position:3%
So is this first fan
fiction about Channing Tatum

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:25.118
or Jonah Hill?

00:01:25.118 --> 00:01:26.019
Here we go.

00:01:27.454 --> 00:01:30.290
I walked over to his shower
still having my towel wrapped

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:31.791
around me.

00:01:31.791 --> 00:01:33.560
When I was getting inside
the shower, to help him,

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.596
my towel got caught on a
hook and he saw everything.

00:01:36.596 --> 00:01:40.266
The upside to this is that
I got to see his everything.

00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:42.569
(whistles)

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:44.204
Now, which one is that?

00:01:44.204 --> 00:01:46.039
Which one do you
guys think it is?

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:47.674
- Not it.

00:01:47.674 --> 00:01:50.076
(laughing)

00:01:50.076 --> 00:01:51.778
- Straight up Jonah Hill.

00:01:51.778 --> 00:01:54.013
- OK. You think Jonah Hill?

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.652
Let's find out.

00:01:59.652 --> 00:02:01.421
The correct answer is.

00:02:02.288 --> 00:02:03.957
It's Channing Tatum.

00:02:04.924 --> 00:02:08.428
(applauding and laughing)

00:02:09.696 --> 00:02:11.331 align:start size:88% position:13%
You even step out of
the shower camera ready.

00:02:11.331 --> 00:02:13.800
How the (beep) do you do that?

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.001
- You don't know who's
in the shower with me,

00:02:15.001 --> 00:02:15.835
getting me ready.

00:02:15.835 --> 00:02:16.669
- Oh damn.

00:02:16.669 --> 00:02:18.938
(laughing)

00:02:20.006 --> 00:02:21.508
- Dude, nice solo.

00:02:22.675 --> 00:02:23.510
Nice solo.

00:02:24.944 --> 00:02:26.379 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Wait so in this scenario,
you're coming outta the shower

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:28.815 align:start size:88% position:13%
and Riggles in the
corner doing air guitar?

00:02:28.815 --> 00:02:32.318
(cheering and applauding)

00:02:33.786 --> 00:02:35.321
- Wanna paint the whole picture.

00:02:35.321 --> 00:02:37.590
- You know how we do
on 22 jump street.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:38.992
- Wait, that's how
you do it on 22?

00:02:38.992 --> 00:02:40.460
- That's how we do
it on 22 jump street.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.128
- Wait, wait, I don't know about

00:02:42.128 --> 00:02:43.296
how we do it on 22 jump street.

00:02:43.296 --> 00:02:46.432 align:start size:84% position:16%
I didn't know nothing
about that part.

00:02:46.432 --> 00:02:48.001
- Alright next one.

00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:49.869
Is this fan fiction about
Rob Riggle or John Oliver?

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:52.872
Or Jonah Hill and
Lee Harvey Oswald.

00:02:54.307 --> 00:02:56.576 align:start size:97% position:3%
- That's actually, we're
doing the voices for the new

00:02:56.576 --> 00:02:57.810
CG ninja turtles.

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.145
That's the cast.

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.084
- So here we go.

00:03:05.084 --> 00:03:07.153
After his giggling subsided,
he began to get comfortable.

00:03:07.153 --> 00:03:08.688
He gazed up at the ceiling,

00:03:08.688 --> 00:03:11.424 align:start size:88% position:13%
noticing how much
lighter the room seemed.

00:03:11.424 --> 00:03:14.093 align:start size:88% position:13%
Well, with this big
strong marine so close,

00:03:14.093 --> 00:03:16.763
what could possibly get him now?

00:03:18.398 --> 00:03:20.633
Channing Tatum is blushing.

00:03:24.337 --> 00:03:28.508
- Is this about Riggle and
Oliver or Hill and Oswald?

00:03:30.076 --> 00:03:31.044
- (Chris) Yes, Riggle.

00:03:31.044 --> 00:03:32.946
- It's Oswald dude.

00:03:32.946 --> 00:03:33.880
- (Chris) You think
it's Oswald and Hill.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:34.847
- It's Oswald and Hill.

00:03:34.847 --> 00:03:35.682
- Alright let's find out.

00:03:35.682 --> 00:03:37.050
Let's find out.

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.718
(laughing)

00:03:38.718 --> 00:03:40.220
Riggle and Oliver.

00:03:46.593 --> 00:03:48.761
- Tickle party convention.

00:03:50.196 --> 00:03:51.431
- It's a page turner.

00:03:51.431 --> 00:03:52.432
- I just read it.

00:03:52.432 --> 00:03:55.001
Sorry that was a
late, late joke.

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:58.571
- Is this fan fiction
about Ice Cube, ice tea

00:03:58.571 --> 00:04:00.073
and a model train set?

00:04:00.073 --> 00:04:02.909
Or Channing Tatum, Jonah
Hill and a model train set?

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:05.812
The men donned their stripe
conductor hats and blank.

00:04:05.812 --> 00:04:08.047 align:start size:94% position:6%
Preceded to show his
guests, each hand painted

00:04:08.047 --> 00:04:11.551
and decorated car of
his impressive train.

00:04:12.852 --> 00:04:14.020
- Who writes this?

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:17.223 align:start size:84% position:16%
- The internet
just churns it out.

00:04:17.223 --> 00:04:18.491
(bell) Ice Cube.

00:04:18.491 --> 00:04:21.094
- I think that's
Jonah and Channing.

00:04:21.094 --> 00:04:23.229 align:start position:0%
- (Chris) You think that's Jonah
and Channing, not the ices?

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:24.364
OK let's find out.

00:04:24.364 --> 00:04:25.865
- No not the ices.

00:04:30.603 --> 00:04:31.604
- I'm sorry.

00:04:33.606 --> 00:04:35.742
- You're so close to getting
the (beep) kicked outta you

00:04:35.742 --> 00:04:36.743
by Ice Cube.

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:40.713
I don't even wanna
tell you how close.

00:04:40.713 --> 00:04:41.547
- Let's find out.

00:04:41.547 --> 00:04:42.949
Let's find out.

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:45.184
(cheering)

00:04:51.924 --> 00:04:53.593
That is the end of 22 Fan Fic.

00:04:53.593 --> 00:04:55.962
I would love to please thank
Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill.

00:04:55.962 --> 00:04:57.997
Make sure to check out 22 Jump
Street in theaters June 13th.

00:04:57.997 --> 00:05:00.333

(applauding)
