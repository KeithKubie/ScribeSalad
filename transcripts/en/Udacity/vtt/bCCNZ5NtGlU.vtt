00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.530
Yes, stressful moments building a team,
there really are a lot.

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:06.550
And the biggest one for
me I remember is then, and honestly,

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:09.955
I still feel this today even in a larger
company when you get to hire somebody,

00:00:09.955 --> 00:00:13.690
you've decided that you want
them to join the company.

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.950
It's that moment when you are waiting
for them to get back to you, because

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:22.348
once you've decided that somebody is
going to help you grow your company and

00:00:22.348 --> 00:00:25.808
get you to the next step,
it feels like life or death to you.

00:00:25.808 --> 00:00:27.921
And so you're just sitting there like,
please say yes, please say yes.

00:00:27.921 --> 00:00:30.280
Texting them may be a little too much.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.040
You know, it's almost like dating.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.410
So yeah, it's a little stressful.
