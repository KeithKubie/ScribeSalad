00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:02.803
We're coming to you from a place

00:00:02.836 --> 00:00:04.371
that is definitely
Rio de Janeiro,

00:00:04.404 --> 00:00:07.140
and not a studio across
from a 7/11 in Los Angeles.

00:00:07.174 --> 00:00:09.610
(laughter)

00:00:09.643 --> 00:00:10.711
...for...

00:00:10.744 --> 00:00:12.379
-(applause and cheering)
-It's not.

00:00:12.412 --> 00:00:15.415
-This is Rio.
-Yeah.

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:16.850
It's definitely Rio.

00:00:16.884 --> 00:00:18.886
I promise this is Rio.

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:21.755
I was robbed four times
on the way to the lectern.

00:00:21.788 --> 00:00:23.624
-(laughter) -This is a weeklong
<i>@midnight</i> tournament

00:00:23.657 --> 00:00:25.259
that'll be just
like the Olympics.

00:00:25.292 --> 00:00:27.861
And by that I mean underfunded
and on an annoying tape-delay.

00:00:27.895 --> 00:00:29.162
(laughter)

00:00:29.196 --> 00:00:30.964
We've scoured the globe

00:00:30.998 --> 00:00:32.866
for the funniest people
from the funniest countries,

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.169
-and also Germany, and brought
them here... -(laughter)

00:00:35.202 --> 00:00:37.838
...to test their wits,
their humor,

00:00:37.871 --> 00:00:40.574
and their ability to share
one functioning toilet.

00:00:40.607 --> 00:00:42.409
And now, I would like

00:00:42.442 --> 00:00:44.545
to welcome you all
to the <i>@midnight</i> Olympics!

00:00:44.578 --> 00:00:47.514
-(cheers and applause)
-(fanfare plays)

00:00:47.548 --> 00:00:48.982
-Hey, stop. stop.
-(music stops)

00:00:49.016 --> 00:00:50.918
Unfortunately,
I can't do that because

00:00:50.951 --> 00:00:52.586
the International Olympic
Committee sent out a letter

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:55.189
threatening legal action
against non-sponsors who...

00:00:55.222 --> 00:00:56.423
"read tweets about the games

00:00:56.456 --> 00:00:58.091
"and any
of its associated trademarks.

00:00:58.125 --> 00:00:59.860
"That includes
the words 'Olympics,'

00:00:59.893 --> 00:01:01.962
'Olympian,' and '#TeamUSA.'"

00:01:01.995 --> 00:01:03.964
I can't even congratulate
Olympic athletes

00:01:03.997 --> 00:01:06.200
on their victories, only
for non-Olympic things. Like...

00:01:06.233 --> 00:01:08.202
Like, for instance,
if I saw this picture

00:01:08.235 --> 00:01:10.270
of a celebrating Michael Phelps,
all I could say is,

00:01:10.304 --> 00:01:12.606
"Congratulations
on your perfect nipples."

00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:14.308
(applause and cheering)

00:01:14.341 --> 00:01:18.679
They're perfect
in every single way.

00:01:18.712 --> 00:01:21.882
But despite
all these legal barriers,

00:01:21.915 --> 00:01:23.450
we're still going
to kick off our tribute

00:01:23.483 --> 00:01:24.885
to that ancient tradition

00:01:24.918 --> 00:01:26.153
of greased-up,
uncircumcised wrestlers

00:01:26.186 --> 00:01:28.355
with an awesome
torch-lighting ceremony.

00:01:28.388 --> 00:01:30.390
Let the game-like
activities start! Comed...

00:01:30.424 --> 00:01:32.092
-(orchestra plays
grand theme) -Oh.

00:01:32.125 --> 00:01:34.728
Is it happening?
I feel it.

00:01:34.761 --> 00:01:38.498
(cheers and applause)

00:01:44.671 --> 00:01:47.474
Comedians, what other things
do we have to do

00:01:47.508 --> 00:01:49.843
to avoid getting sued
by the I.O.C.?

00:01:49.877 --> 00:01:51.879
-Yakov Smirnoff, go.
-The Olympics game--

00:01:51.912 --> 00:01:55.849
you are not supposed to do drugs
or take drugs.

00:01:55.883 --> 00:01:58.519
On this show,
it's mandatory to take...

00:01:58.552 --> 00:02:00.387
-HARDWICK: Yeah. Yeah.
-(laughter, applause &amp; cheering)

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.390
Hopefully, everyone's
juiced up and ready to go.

00:02:03.423 --> 00:02:04.858
Flula Borg.

00:02:04.892 --> 00:02:06.927
You cannot swallow
any raw sewage

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.663
without a
raw sewage-swallowing permit.

00:02:09.696 --> 00:02:11.265
And good luck getting that

00:02:11.298 --> 00:02:13.233
all because
of bureaucracy red tape!

00:02:13.267 --> 00:02:16.436
-All right, points. Yes, very
good. Very good. -(laughter)

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.038
(applause and cheering)

00:02:18.071 --> 00:02:19.506
Thank you.

00:02:20.607 --> 00:02:23.877
Maeve Higgins.

00:02:23.911 --> 00:02:26.246
You cannot, um, hire
the IOC as your secretary

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.614
and then sexually harass them.

00:02:27.648 --> 00:02:27.714
-(laughter) -HARDWICK:
No, you can't do that.
