00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Yes when I was 10 years old I used to live in Shepherd's Bush in West London not that far from here

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.540
And every Saturday afternoon I used to go to Shepherd's Bush market

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:23.500
You see I was very keen to see what people were selling. What they were buying.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.820
But most importantly, what they were throwing away.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.880
Because very frequently among the rubbish

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.600
I could find something useful

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.420
For instance wooden boxes, from which I could make a cricket bat

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.740
But, every Saturday afternoon

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:38.840
There was a very strange man

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.780
He was completely bold and he was selling medicines

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.980
He was selling medicines in the form of purple tablets

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.320
Like this, and he told everyone

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.320
That these tablets were very good for you

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.100
Because they could cure you of any disease

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.760
Whether you had a headache, tooth ache, muscle pain, neuralgia

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.260
nostalgia, you name it, this medicine would cure it.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.700
So people were very fascinated to actually be able to buy this medicine

00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:39.180
This was made about three hundred year ago. They rapidly realised

00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:41.180
that there are

00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:43.180
2 main gases in the air, one of them

00:29:43.180 --> 00:29:45.180
which actually

00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:47.180
responsible for burning  and

00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:49.180
that was called Oxygen.

00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:51.180
The other one they called

00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:53.180
Nitrogen.And they recognised

00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:55.180
that about one fifth of the air

00:29:55.180 --> 00:29:57.180
is Oxygen

00:29:57.180 --> 00:29:59.180
And then they started

00:29:59.180 --> 00:30:01.180
to do experiment to make fuels burn

00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:03.180
better, not by mixing with air

00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:05.180
but trying to mix them

00:30:05.180 --> 00:30:07.180
with Oxygen or get them

00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:09.180
to combine with Oxygen

00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:11.180
and I wanted to show you the result

00:30:11.180 --> 00:30:13.180
of one such experiment

00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:15.180
which was a remarkable triumph of

00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:17.180
the science of Chemistry and

00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:19.180
it's occurred using the most

00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:21.180
mundane of substances you

00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:23.180
could possibly imagined and that

00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:25.180
is cotton wool.

00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:27.180
Cotton wool is a natural

00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:35.100
fibre. It has  been known to human being for over five thousand year and we know that

00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:41.100
cotton was first grown and used on a large scale in India and also in Mexico

00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:45.100
. But it is in India where the great culture of cotton culture of cotton fabric,

00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:49.100
cotton weaving grew for thousand of years

00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:53.100
well before it reach Europe. Now cotton,

00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:57.100
what is cotton chemically speaking? Well, it is a very delicate fabric ,

00:30:57.100 --> 00:31:01.100
it is used in clothing of course as you know and for

00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:05.100
cosmetic application. and chemically speaking it's called cellulose  .

00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:09.100
it's a natural polymer  which occurs and which is very

00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:13.100
very comfortable to the touch and warm to the feel.

00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:17.100
and that is why it has a  great  place in our human history.  Not to mention

00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:21.100
the fact that the cotton played a huge role in the industrial revolution

00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:25.100
in this country during the 18 century when cotton weaving and spinning were

00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:29.100
developed in the . Now, if  you watch carefully

00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:33.100
who on earth would think of burning. Well Chemist thought of burning everything

00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:37.100
and this is one of the things.They burnt cotton you see,

00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:41.100
they thought  it may be wonderful. there it is , it is  burning in air, a hugely boring

00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:45.100
experiment you see it is burning in air, because air contain only

00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:49.100
about 20 percent Oxygen you see and so this is  what we have

00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:53.100
incomplete combustion it is burning with

00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:57.100
this sort of slightly yellowy flame and

00:31:57.100 --> 00:32:01.100
there is tiny bit of ash left and 
entirely unspectacular

00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:05.100
almost like a piece of paper. Now What I wanted to to tell you  next

00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:09.100
during the 19 century, during the middle of the

00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:13.100
19 century, Chemists were experimenting with

00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:17.100
adding Oxygen to different  fuels either mixing it or

00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:21.100
combining them chemically and the remarkable result

00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:25.100
was achieved by 2 scientists working independently with

00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:27.100
cotton, one of them  was

00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:31.100
Ascanio Sobrero who was an Italian. The other one was

00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:35.100
Christian Schönbein , who was a German organic chemist.

00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:39.100
Christian Schönbein was a good friend and colleague

00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:43.100
of the great Michael Faraday who

00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:47.100
delivered teacher's lectures in this precise spot here for  over

00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:51.100
30 years during the 19 century. So it was

00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:55.100
Christian Schönbein
who actually was the first person

00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:59.100
who manage to add to  cotton with

00:32:59.100 --> 00:33:03.100
some extra Oxygen. Now how did he achieve that? And also,

00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:07.100
I told you in the beginning that we can frequently recognise a chemical

00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:11.100
change by a change of colour and yet you say look this cotton wool

00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:15.100
that I have got here, look the same and feels  exactly

00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:19.100
the same  as the cotton wool that I had a minute ago. And yet this has

00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:23.100
got the extra Oxygen as I will show you in a second. How therefore

00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:27.100
is this different? Dear children, the difference could be seen

00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:29.100
by weighing it. You see, if you weigh

00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:33.100
one of those. They weigh 1.7g

00:33:33.100 --> 00:33:37.100
but this weigh 2.8g.

00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:41.100
An extra of 1.1g of Oxygen.

00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:45.100
Now that is huge amount of extra Oxygen added in.

00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:49.100
It actually does have some Nitrogen as well. You may say

00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:53.100
how did they add this? Well let's first of all see whether it works

00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:57.100
of course because there is no point in talking about the effect if we don't see

00:33:57.100 --> 00:34:01.100
how it was done if it doesn't work. So first of all, let's get ourselves

00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:05.100
something to talk about. So here then is our cotton

00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:09.100
wool which has had extra Oxygen added to it. And let"s see how

00:34:09.100 --> 00:34:13.100
this burns and spot the difference. And as you see,

00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:17.100
there was an instantaneous combustion.The whole things burn very,very

00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:21.100
very quickly indeed and there was virtually

00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:25.100
nothing left at all you see. Now that of course, now

00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:29.100
that of course , dear children is the proof that the experiment was

00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:33.100
successful. Now when Schönbein achieve this

00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:37.100
experiment, he was absolutely delighted. And as I said Sobrero,

00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:41.100
they were working separately, one of them with cotton, the other with glycerin

00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:45.100
and they were similar substances and they achieve this type of result. They thought this

00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:49.100
was absolutely amazing. For your information, the way this was

00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:53.100
made is using a very similar substance to what's used in

00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:57.100
gun powder. Gun powder contains sulphur, charcoal.

00:34:57.100 --> 00:35:01.100
and potassium nitrate, nitrates. This uses nitric acid

00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:05.100
and sulphuric acid. You mix them together and you soak the cotton

00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:09.100
wool for  half an hour. And you end up with this. So the Oxygen

00:35:09.100 --> 00:35:13.100
comes about indirectly. But then chemist are people who understood

00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:17.100
this processes and that's why they are able to

00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:19.100
bring about the effect. Now, what about I have

00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:23.100
actually made here is a high explosive. It is of course a very very dangerous

00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:27.100
substance. It is popular. Its name in the industry is called  a

00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:31.100
gun cotton, nitro cellulose. It is hugely dangerous. It is used in

00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:35.100
engineering and military purposes.  And I would like to demonstrate

00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:39.100
an explosion for you. Unfortunately, that would be far

00:35:39.100 --> 00:35:43.100
too dangerous. So what I am going to do instead, I am going to demonstrate

00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:47.100
a propulsion and even 2 propulsions if we're lucky.

00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:51.100
And what is a propulsion? A propulsion is a directed

00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:55.100
explosion. A explosion is a rapidly release of gases everywhere,

00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:59.100
forcing something apart. A propulsion though

00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:03.100
is when you direct them in one

00:36:03.100 --> 00:36:07.100
direction. So I'm going to start off by showing you how

00:36:07.100 --> 00:36:11.100
to use this to make a simple mortar. It's rather similar to a

00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:15.100
canon. And I'm going to propel some ping pong ball,

00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:19.100
hopefully to the ceiling of our dear Royal Institution

00:36:19.100 --> 00:36:23.100
Now what I have here is a special,

00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:27.100
It's a like canon. It's technically called the mortar and

00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:31.100
principle of it is that you burn the fuel at the bottom

00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:35.100
when the fuel which will be gun cotton burnt at the bottom. It releases

00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:39.100
a huge amount of hot gases and they will force

00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:43.100
the ping pong ball to fly, hopefully to the ceiling

00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:47.100
So that is the principle of  this and what I wanted to tell

00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:51.100
you dear children is every time you watch one of those fireworks

00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:55.100
displays where there are massive shells exploding in the sky

00:36:55.100 --> 00:36:59.100
and colours. They are all projected from these.

00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:03.100
Only they are made of thick cardboard and their shelves go up and they

00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:07.100
explode in the air. Today,  we are not going to

00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:11.100
explode the shelves up there. We're simply going to fire ping pong balls. Now
