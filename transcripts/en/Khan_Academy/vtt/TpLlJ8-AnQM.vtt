00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:06.870
When the Federal Reserve
does traditional open-market

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.280
operations, what they
do is the Fed over here

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.180
will literally print money.

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.630
So it prints money.

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:18.340
It doesn't necessarily
have to be cash,

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.010
it could be electronic money.

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.750
And it uses that money to buy
usually short-term treasury

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.990
securities in the open market.

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:29.740
That's why it's called
open market operations.

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.419
So in exchange it gets
treasury securities.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.350
Now, the whole
purpose of this, it

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.670
does increase the
demand for treasuries,

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.070
and, therefore, increases
the price on treasuries

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:43.680
and lower the interest rate.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.500
But the main point is it
takes this printed money,

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.520
and it puts it in
the banking system.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.510
Because it buys treasuries just
from people, or from banks,

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.010
or institutions, and then
those people take that cash,

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.390
that they just got
for these treasuries,

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.840
and they'll deposit it in banks.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.890
So they'll go and they'll
deposit it in, maybe,

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.140
Bank 1 over here, then
over here in Bank 2.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.520
And since there's more
money in Bank 1 and Bank 2,

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.420
you have the supply
of money going up,

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.110
and also the demand for
reserves is going up.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.420
This cash right here,
these are reserves.

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.119
So you have the demand
for reserves going down.

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:26.910
Maybe before this money
entered the system,

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:29.260
maybe Bank 2 is running
low on reserves.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.770
But now people have
deposited money in Bank 2,

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.130
so Bank 2 doesn't
need it as much.

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.360
And if you have the
supply of money going up,

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.390
you have the demand
for money going down--

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.590
where in particular I'm
talking about reserves.

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.180
I'm talking about
base-money right over here--

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.000
then the overnight
borrowing rate between banks

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.350
will go down.

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.360
The price of money will go down.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.400
And that's what the
federal funds rate is.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.800
It's the target rate.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.690
So I'll say fed funds rate.

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:58.850
It's the target
rate that the Fed

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.800
sets for the overnight borrowing
of reserves between banks.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.990
That's the federal funds
rate, and it will go down.

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.570
And that's how the Fed tries
to set the federal funds rate.

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.350
Now, fast forward to a
situation like we are right now.

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.570
And the federal funds
rate is already at 0,

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.690
but the Fed still wants to pump
more money into the economy

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.520
and it wants to do it
in a more directed way.

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.210
So now what it's doing,
it's still printing money,

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:28.160
but it's using that money
to buy other things.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.490
It could buy longer-term debt.

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:34.220
So it could buy longer
duration treasuries.

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.290
So things that are
maybe going to,

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.200
maybe 10-year treasury bonds,
or further out than even that.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.150
Or it could even buy
completely different assets.

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.820
It could maybe buy
mortgage backed securities.

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.520
And the point here isn't just
to increase the money supply.

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.340
The point in quantitative
easing is, maybe,

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.230
to kind of smooth
over what's happening

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:58.660
in certain parts of the market.

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.201
So if they think that there's
a logjam in the mortgage backed

00:03:01.201 --> 00:03:03.980
security market, that's why
they're participating there.

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.996
So this right over here,
that is quantitative easing.
