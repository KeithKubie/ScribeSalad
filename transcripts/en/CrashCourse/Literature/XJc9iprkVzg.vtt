00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:05.480
Hello and welcome to Crash Course literature,
the best of all possible Crash Courses, discussing

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.970
the best of all possible novels here on the
best of all possible sets.

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:15.269
I am the best of all possible John Greens—which
is saying something, because there are a lot

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:16.269
of us.

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:20.440
Today we’re discussing “Candide, or Optimism”
a work of fiction by the Enlightenment philosopher

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.800
François-Marie Arouet, who went by the name
Voltaire, because wouldn’t you if you could

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.230
pull off the one name thing?

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.650
I’m feeling incredibly optimistic about
today’s video.

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:36.150
So, let’s get started!

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:41.390
[Intro]
So, Voltaire was born in Paris in 1694.

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.780
His dad wanted him to be a lawyer.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.050
Voltaire wanted to be a writer. and not for
the last time, Voltaire won the argument.

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:49.700
And Voltaire wrote a lot.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.102
Like, hundreds and hundreds of books and pamphlets
a lot.

00:00:53.102 --> 00:00:56.200
And okay, pamphlets are very short books,
but still.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.060
He wrote essays and poems and dramas.

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.270
Much of it pretty satirical.

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.820
He had a hilarious verse, for instance, accusing
the King’s Regent of incest with his own

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.719
daughter, which landed Voltaire in the Bastille
prison for nearly a year..

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:13.030
Voltaire was big on two beliefs: Empiricism
and Religious Tolerance.

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.420
Empiricism is the argument that knowledge
of the world is discovered through experience

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.229
and evidence as opposed to philosophical speculation.

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:23.579
And religious tolerance should be self-explanatory.

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:26.609
Although it was not self-explanatory in 18th
Century France.

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:31.229
Voltaire himself subscribed to the religion
of Deism: The belief that God is a clockmaker

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.780
who set the world in motion and then stood
back to watch it tick.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.789
So, before we get into the philosophical context
and themes of “Candide,” which was written

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:43.079
1759 and published anonymously, because, you
know, Voltaire didn’t want to go back to

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.170
the Bastille, let’s review the story in
the Thoughtbubble.

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.969
When the book begins, Candide, a naïve young
man, is living an easy life on his uncle’s

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:55.689
estate with his cousin Cunegonde, whose name
is sort of a dirty joke that we really can’t

00:01:55.689 --> 00:02:01.880
get into, and his tutor Dr. Pangloss, who
insists that Candide is enjoying the best

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.709
of all possible worlds.

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:09.060
When Cunegonde catches her chambermaid scoodilypooping
with Pangloss, she decides to kiss Candide,

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.860
and that gets Candide kicked off of the estate,
forced into military service, beaten and nearly

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:15.910
killed.

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.329
Best of all possible worlds?

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:21.450
(1) Then Candide escapes the army and is helped
by a nice heretic named James.

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.930
On the street, he sees a poor victim of syphilis
with half his nose missing, and turns out,

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.099
it’s Pangloss!

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:30.640
Pangloss tells him that the army overran the
uncle’s estate and killed everyone.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.489
(2) Then he and Candide and James go to Lisbon
where James drowns, and then an earthquake

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:36.489
hits.

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:40.239
During the ensuing devastation, Candide and
Pangloss are arrested as heretics and Pangloss

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:41.239
is hanged.

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:46.049
But Candide escapes and meets up with Cunegonde,
who’s alive and the mistress to both a rich

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:48.500
Jewish merchant and a Catholic inquisitor.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.989
Candide kills both the men and he and Cunegonde
escape.

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:55.010
But then they separate, and Candide makes
his way to Buenos Aires and eventually to

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:00.080
El Dorado, the fabled city of gold, and then
eventually, he makes his way to Constantinople,

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.219
where he meets Cunegonde again, who unfortunately
is now ugly.

00:03:04.219 --> 00:03:06.430
In Voltaire’s world, there is seemingly
nothing worse.

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:11.170
And everyone is pretty unhappy by this point
in the best of all possible worlds, until

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:16.769
Candide and Cunegonde realize that maybe the
best thing to do is just farm the land they

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:17.769
have.

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:20.040
Candide says, “We must go and work in the
garden.”

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.230
And then the weeding begins.

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:22.230
Thanks, Thoughtbubble.

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.999
It’s a lot of plot.

00:03:23.999 --> 00:03:25.660
Voltaire--never short on the plot.

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.799
Lots of sex and travel and murder and not
murder.

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:30.629
There are some reasons for all of this.

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:36.200
So, Candide is an episodic novel, just like
it sounds, a form based on one episode after

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.200
another.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.340
It’s also in some ways a picaresque novel,
which is a collection of adventures undertaken

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:46.909
by a wily hero or heroine, although at the
same time, it’s kind of an anti-picaresque

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:52.410
novel, because as you may have noticed, Candide
is not terribly wily, and also it ends not

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.459
with an ongoing adventure but with gardening.

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:59.250
Candide is also a version of a bildungsroman,
a term we’ve mentioned before, which is

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.840
a novel of a young person’s education.

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.239
Although we could debate how much Candide
actually learns.

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:08.930
A big part of Voltaire’s satire involves
adopting these forms that he’s trying to

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.019
mock, then turning them inside out.

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:15.079
to that point, “Candide” is also an Enlightenment
novel that’s deeply critical of a lot of

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:16.459
Enlightenment philosophy.

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:21.560
It’s a parody of the classic romance—boy
meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.610
back, but now she’s been disemboweled.
also, they probably don’t live happily ever

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:26.610
after.

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.490
So how seriously should we take this book?

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:33.500
Is it just a series of potty-humor parodies,
or is it a real intellectual inquiry?

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.260
Well, I would argue it’s both, just like
the Captain Underpants movie.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.250
I mean, the book is definitely funny and extremely
rude.

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:43.660
When it was first published, it was banned
in a bunch of countries because of the ways

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.930
it mocked politics and religion.

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:49.449
Even people who didn’t want it banned thought
that its humor was too dark.

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:51.919
and that’s certainly one justifiable way
to read the book.

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:55.430
But I think there’s more going on here than
just jokes about disembowelment.

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:57.180
Oh, it’s time for the open letter?

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.040
An open letter to disembowelment.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.960
Oh, but first let’s see what’s in the
secret compartment today.

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:02.960
OH!

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:03.960
Look at that.

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:04.960
It’s a guillotine!

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.669
Dear Disembowelment,
I’ve done a fair amount of reading on 18th

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:12.139
century methods of French execution,
and wow, does it seem very close to the worst

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:15.180
of all possible worlds when it comes to criminal
justice.

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.150
Torture, was the rule, not the exception.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:22.180
Execution was a common punishment for all
kinds of different crimes, and you were lucky

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.590
if you got hanged or beheaded.

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:27.169
Because you could get burned alive, or disemboweled,
or both.

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:29.490
By comparison, the guillotine seemed humane.

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:32.099
In fact, it was designed to be humane.

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:34.961
In short, disembowelment, when it comes to
you, I’m with Voltaire.

00:05:34.961 --> 00:05:39.949
I just don’t think you have any role to
play in the best of all possible worlds.

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:41.260
Worst wishes, John Green.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.790
OK, so at the heart of all that rudeness,
is a big question.

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:48.550
How do we understand evil in the world, and
What are we gonna do about it?

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:53.620
Difficult questions, and also among the oldest
and most important for religion and for literature.

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:58.330
And even though Voltaire was very smart and
deeply opinionated, he doesn’t pretend to

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:02.740
have an answer, but he does want to negate
what he sees as bad answers.

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:07.180
“Candide” is a direct response to Gottfried
Wilhelm Leibniz’s “philosophical optimism,”

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:13.409
a strand of philosophy arguing that since
god is good everything must be for the best

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:16.030
in this “the best of all possible words.”

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:20.229
And this was a very common philosophical understanding
at the time, even though, you know, it seems

00:06:20.229 --> 00:06:21.720
a little bit ludicrous to us.

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:26.159
I mean, the great thing about philosophical
optimism is that it solved the problem of

00:06:26.159 --> 00:06:31.190
what scholars of religious traditions call
theodicy--the problem of evil in a world that

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:35.389
is ostensibly overseen by an all-powerful
and all-knowing god.

00:06:35.389 --> 00:06:37.590
Pangloss’s teachings are straight-up Leibniz.

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:41.250
Pangloss’s name, by the way, literally means
“all talk.”

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:46.199
This optimistic determinism was a big problem
for Voltaire so he makes it a problem for

00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:47.199
Candide, too.

00:06:47.199 --> 00:06:51.610
Quick pause for a bit of history: In 1755
there was an enormous earthquake in Lisbon,

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:54.689
Portugal, followed by a tsunami, followed
by a fire.

00:06:54.689 --> 00:06:59.729
The disasters killed an estimated 60,000 people,
nearly a third of the city.

00:06:59.729 --> 00:07:01.010
Voltaire of course used this in “Candide.”

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:05.509
He also wrote about it in a poem called “Poem
on the Lisbon Disaster,” because Voltaire

00:07:05.509 --> 00:07:07.000
wasn’t the best at titles.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.240
He subtitled the poem, “An Inquiry into
the Axiom ‘All Is Well.’”

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:15.070
And it’s clear that for Voltaire the earthquake
was really good evidence that Leibniz’s

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:16.599
theory was deeply flawed.

00:07:16.599 --> 00:07:20.180
The poem reads:
“All is well,” you say, “and all is

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:21.180
necessary.”

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:22.180
What!

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:27.449
Do you think this universe would be worse
Without the pit that swallowed Lisbon?

00:07:27.449 --> 00:07:31.700
And in the novel, Candide experiences similar
disillusionment, part of it in Lisbon.

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:37.290
But good old Pangloss, half-dead from syphilis,
is still arguing that his syphilis is part

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:39.509
of the best of all possible worlds.

00:07:39.509 --> 00:07:44.180
Christopher Columbus after all brought syphilis
a New World disease back to Europe.

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:48.909
And Pangloss argues that if Columbus hadn’t
gone to the new world, and caught this disease,

00:07:48.909 --> 00:07:52.979
“which poisons the source of generations,”
we wouldn’t have chocolate, a New World

00:07:52.979 --> 00:07:53.979
food.

00:07:53.979 --> 00:07:54.979
Now I like chocolate.

00:07:54.979 --> 00:07:58.849
I also like lot’s of other New World foods,
like tomatoes, and corn and peppers and so

00:07:58.849 --> 00:07:59.849
on.

00:07:59.849 --> 00:08:04.349
But I don’t think any of that justifies
the horrible parts of the Columbian Exchange,

00:08:04.349 --> 00:08:06.560
and syphilis is just one of many.

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:09.990
Voltaire proves this point, that we don’t
seem to be living in the best of all possible

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:13.740
worlds, over and over in the novel, arguably
too often.

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:18.030
He probably makes it most explicit when, one
of the novel’s few really good characters,

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:20.470
James, drowns saving a terrible person.

00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:23.910
And yet I don’t think that Voltaire is arguing
for mere pessimism.

00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:28.810
Like, the old woman, a companion of Cunegonde’s
tells a really harrowing life story, which

00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:31.479
climaxes with one of her buttocks being cut
off.

00:08:31.479 --> 00:08:32.479
Because of course it does.

00:08:32.479 --> 00:08:37.170
But she ends it: “I have wanted to kill
myself 100 times, but somehow I am still in

00:08:37.170 --> 00:08:38.170
love with life.”

00:08:38.170 --> 00:08:42.220
Now, she goes on to call this desire to live
a “ridiculous weakness” and compares loving

00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:48.020
life to “fondling a snake that devours us,”
but still, the novel acknowledges and embraces

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:49.950
that humans love life.

00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:54.250
And it also acknowledges that there’s plenty
to love about life, like candied fruit.

00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:55.650
And pistachio nuts.

00:08:55.650 --> 00:09:00.010
Just don’t get carried away thinking that
you’re in a full-on benevolent universe

00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:01.010
or anything.

00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:04.900
Tangentially related, Voltaire did not believe,
like the philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau

00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:08.730
did, that the real source of the problems
is modern society.

00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:13.910
We know this because when Candide escapes
to the new world, things are still quite non-ideal,

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:15.720
what with all the cannibalism and syphilis.

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:19.330
And it’s worth mentioning that Voltaire
is anything but enlightened when it comes

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:21.160
to his imagining of the new world.

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:26.810
Voltaire’s racism and misogyny might reflect
his times, but his pseudoscientific justifications

00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:29.260
for them are worth noting in our times.

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:33.451
So the final jab at the “best of all possible
worlds” thing comes late in the novel, when

00:09:33.451 --> 00:09:37.970
Voltaire takes us to El Dorado, the famed
city of gold, where the streets are lined

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:38.970
with jewels.

00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:41.690
No one is hungry, no one is poor, no one is
oppressed.

00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:47.010
The king is nice to everyone and the enlightened
citizens just love philosophy and science.

00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:48.040
And guess what?

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:49.110
It’s extremely boring.

00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:51.000
Candide can’t wait to leave.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.510
This novel is so dystopian even the utopia
sucks.

00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:58.370
At the end of the book, Candide is miraculously
reunited with all of his friends and together

00:09:58.370 --> 00:09:59.480
they buy a little farm.

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:01.130
But again, they are very bored.

00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:05.230
They go visit a famous wise man in the hopes
that he can explain the meaning of life to

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:07.230
them, but he slams the door in their faces.

00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:11.710
And then, on the way back, they meet a farmer
who seems happy enough and his daughters make

00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:13.190
everyone sherbet drinks.

00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:17.960
And then drinking their sherbet, Candide realizes
that he should go back to his farm and try

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:21.520
to make it prosper and maybe not worry about
philosophy so much.

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:26.290
And then comes the famous last line “We
should go and work in our garden,” or possibly,

00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:30.050
depending on your translation, “Let us go
and cultivate our garden.”

00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:32.040
It’s the “our garden” that’s the important
part.

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:34.140
Like we should stop worrying about everyone
else’s garden.

00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:36.080
And I guess that seems sensible enough.

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:40.770
A lot of people would probably feel better
if instead of worrying themselves sick about

00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:45.140
the problem of evil in their lives, and in
other people’s lives, they just grew some

00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:46.960
tomatoes and worked on their embroidery.

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:50.880
But as a conclusion to this particular novel,
it does seem weirdly conservative?

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:53.760
I mean, the ending is a return to a garden.

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:55.510
What’s more Biblical than that?

00:10:55.510 --> 00:10:58.270
And there’s also this selfishness to that
choice.

00:10:58.270 --> 00:10:59.270
Our garden.

00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:03.800
I mean there is a huge earthquake in the novel,
but most of the suffering is inflicted not

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:07.560
by a higher power but by humans upon one another.

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:11.750
These humans rape and kill and disembowel
each other, and growing tomatoes may be a

00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:16.330
way of personally opting out of those social
problems, but I’m not convinced it does

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:17.660
much to fix them.

00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:21.480
I guess Voltaire thinks those problems are
unfixable, and that people will be evil no

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:26.160
matter what, but should we succumb to that
pessimism or should we try to work to change

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:29.870
and improve this not-yet-best-of-all-possible-worlds?

00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:33.820
Is it enough to tend your own garden, or do
we have a responsibility to help our neighbors

00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:35.410
tend their gardens as well?

00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:36.410
I don’t know.

00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:38.860
But, I do think we should at least share our
vegetables.

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:44.740
Thanks for watching.

00:11:44.740 --> 00:12:02.380
We’ll see you next time.
