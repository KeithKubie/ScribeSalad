there are orchestrating the way in which
they think and if you could capture that

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:46.730
they think and if you could capture that
 

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:50.230
they think and if you could capture that
moment then that can that can do two

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240
moment then that can that can do two
 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.930
moment then that can that can do two
things it can at them at the time that

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:52.940
things it can at them at the time that
 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:55.300
things it can at them at the time that
you do it it can give the reader the

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.310
you do it it can give the reader the
 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:57.520
you do it it can give the reader the
pleasure of recognition that the the

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:57.530
pleasure of recognition that the the
 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:58.990
pleasure of recognition that the the
reader reads the book and says oh yeah

00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.000
reader reads the book and says oh yeah
 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.650

this is what it's like you know and and
 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.900
this is what it's like you know and and
then you know say 30 40 50 years later

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:04.910
then you know say 30 40 50 years later
 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:07.150
then you know say 30 40 50 years later
people can read the same book and think

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.160
people can read the same book and think
 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.400

so on the one hand it's has an immediate
pleasure the pleasure of recognition and

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:15.410
pleasure the pleasure of recognition and
 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:17.710
pleasure the pleasure of recognition and
then later on it has that pleasure of

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:17.720
then later on it has that pleasure of
 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.720
then later on it has that pleasure of
finding that moment captured you know

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:19.730
finding that moment captured you know
 

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:22.720
finding that moment captured you know
like captured in aspect and available to

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:22.730
like captured in aspect and available to
 

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:25.990
like captured in aspect and available to
people in the future so I think those

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000
people in the future so I think those
 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.370
people in the future so I think those
are some of the things you know that if

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:27.380
are some of the things you know that if
 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:31.030
are some of the things you know that if
you're looking for work that lasts you

know that that that that are very
 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:35.650
know that that that that are very
important I mean there is also just the

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:35.660
important I mean there is also just the
 

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:38.680
important I mean there is also just the
question of language skill you know

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:38.690
question of language skill you know
 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:40.960
question of language skill you know
everything there is a lot of writing

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:40.970
everything there is a lot of writing
 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:43.570
everything there is a lot of writing
that we still look at because it

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:43.580
that we still look at because it
 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:46.060
that we still look at because it
developed our idea of what the English

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:46.070
developed our idea of what the English
 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:48.880
developed our idea of what the English
language could be that's also something

language could be that's also something
 

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:51.159
language could be that's also something
of course that you know at the time of

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:51.169
of course that you know at the time of
 

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:53.230
of course that you know at the time of
Shakespeare English was in a very fluid

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:53.240
Shakespeare English was in a very fluid
 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.450
Shakespeare English was in a very fluid

know there wasn't there wasn't even a
fixed orthography at that time but but

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:02.000
fixed orthography at that time but but
 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.920
fixed orthography at that time but but
out of that moment of enormous lis fluid

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:05.930
out of that moment of enormous lis fluid
 

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:08.560
out of that moment of enormous lis fluid
language Shakespeare created in a way

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:08.570
language Shakespeare created in a way
 

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:13.180
language Shakespeare created in a way
created English he created a way of

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:13.190

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:15.730
created English he created a way of
using this language that we all still

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:15.740
using this language that we all still
 

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:17.980
using this language that we all still
use I mean we all use hundreds of

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:17.990
use I mean we all use hundreds of
 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:19.690
use I mean we all use hundreds of
expressions out of Shakespeare most of

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:19.700
expressions out of Shakespeare most of
 

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:20.860
expressions out of Shakespeare most of
us don't even know they come from

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:20.870
us don't even know they come from

Shakespeare you know they've just become

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:22.760
Shakespeare you know they've just become
 

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:26.140
Shakespeare you know they've just become
a part of the English language so there

a part of the English language so there
 

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:28.590
a part of the English language so there
is that you know that that's ability to

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:28.600
is that you know that that's ability to
 

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.270
is that you know that that's ability to
to reimagine the language and by doing

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:31.280
to reimagine the language and by doing
 

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:39.050
to reimagine the language and by doing
that to enrich the language and and that

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:39.060
 

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:41.360
along with with formal innovation you

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:41.370
along with with formal innovation you
 

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:43.220
along with with formal innovation you
know another thing that that makes work

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:43.230
know another thing that that makes work
 

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:44.840
know another thing that that makes work
last and this is not just a literature

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:44.850
last and this is not just a literature
 

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:47.240
last and this is not just a literature
it's true also in in painting and music

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:47.250
it's true also in in painting and music
 

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:49.550
it's true also in in painting and music
and so on is that there are there are

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:49.560
and so on is that there are there are
 

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:53.030
and so on is that there are there are
works which make you see the form itself

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:53.040
works which make you see the form itself
 

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:55.940
works which make you see the form itself
in a new way you know in the way for

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:55.950
in a new way you know in the way for
 

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:57.620
in a new way you know in the way for
example in painting what the

than everything being in sharp focus all

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:06.750
than everything being in sharp focus all
 

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:08.680
than everything being in sharp focus all
the time that's not how we see you know

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:08.690
the time that's not how we see you know
 

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:11.210
the time that's not how we see you know
the way we see is we see something in

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:11.220
the way we see is we see something in
 

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:12.680
the way we see is we see something in
sharp focus and around it there are

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:12.690
sharp focus and around it there are
 

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:16.219
sharp focus and around it there are
other things not so much so that idea of

00:07:16.219 --> 00:07:16.229
other things not so much so that idea of
 

00:07:16.229 --> 00:07:20.690
other things not so much so that idea of
of depicting in oil something closer to

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:20.700
of depicting in oil something closer to
 

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:22.820
of depicting in oil something closer to

know in fact the term him when the first

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:28.110
know in fact the term him when the first
 

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:29.690
know in fact the term him when the first
impressionist exhibition happened

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:29.700
impressionist exhibition happened
 

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:32.210
impressionist exhibition happened
the term Impressionism was used as a as

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:32.220
the term Impressionism was used as a as
 

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:35.300
the term Impressionism was used as a as
an insult no it was that these painters

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:35.310
an insult no it was that these painters
 

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:36.560
an insult no it was that these painters
weren't really very good at painting

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:36.570
weren't really very good at painting
 

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:37.909
weren't really very good at painting
they could just give an impression of

00:07:37.909 --> 00:07:37.919
they could just give an impression of
 

00:07:37.919 --> 00:07:41.300
they could just give an impression of
something and so to go from that to have

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:41.310
something and so to go from that to have
 

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:43.880
something and so to go from that to have
those painters as being the bedrock of

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:43.890
those painters as being the bedrock of
 

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:45.800
those painters as being the bedrock of
any great modern art collection you know

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:45.810
any great modern art collection you know
 

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:49.040
any great modern art collection you know
shows you how work that was considered

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:49.050
shows you how work that was considered
 

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:52.400
shows you how work that was considered
to be no in a way outrageous at the time

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:52.410
to be no in a way outrageous at the time
 

00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:54.830
to be no in a way outrageous at the time
in which it was made changes the

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:54.840
in which it was made changes the
 

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:56.300
in which it was made changes the
language change it changed the language

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:56.310
language change it changed the language
 

00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:58.700
language change it changed the language
of art you know and therefore of course

00:07:58.700 --> 00:07:58.710
of art you know and therefore of course
 

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:01.370
of art you know and therefore of course
has enormous enduring quality because

00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:01.380
has enormous enduring quality because
 

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:03.710
has enormous enduring quality because
everything that came after it could not

00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:03.720
everything that came after it could not
 

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:05.120
everything that came after it could not
have been like that if it had not been

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:05.130
have been like that if it had not been
 

00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:09.469
have been like that if it had not been
for that for that moment so so both in

00:08:09.469 --> 00:08:09.479
for that for that moment so so both in
 

00:08:09.479 --> 00:08:12.110
for that for that moment so so both in
terms of language and form the question

00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:12.120
