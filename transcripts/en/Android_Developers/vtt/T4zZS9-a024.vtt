ADI HADDAD: I'm Adi.

00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:02.380
I'm Games video manager.

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:03.550
I'm based in Tel Aviv.

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:06.220
And I work with Israel and
Turkish gaming companies.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:10.520
And I camp and I win
games because of that.

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.150
So let's start with a question.

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:15.580
By raise of hands, who
wants to make more money

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:16.720
from their games?

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:17.900
Raise your hands.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:18.400
Yeah.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.330
That makes sense because
you're here today.

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:23.770
And the obvious
follow up question

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:28.150
should be, how can you make
more money from your games?

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.420
Harry Markowitz, a Nobel
Prize winning economist,

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.790
said he would never be 100%
invested in stocks, or bonds,

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.460
or cash, basically
saying he will never

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.230
put all his eggs in one basket.

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.540
And when you think about
it, why mobile games should

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.290
be any different?

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.910
Why rely on one
source of revenue

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.100
and not try to diversify
your revenue streams?

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.388
In our industry it's set
up in a very unique way.

00:00:52.388 --> 00:00:54.680
Usually the game genres
determine the game monetization

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:55.480
you have.

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.120
So in hyper casual games, we
usually see ad monetization.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.200
In RPG and strategy games,
we usually IP monetization.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.777
And this isn't a bad thing.

00:01:04.777 --> 00:01:06.860
But today I wanted to take
a step back and rethink

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.570
this assumption.

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.550
Ask yourself, does
that make sense

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.480
to focus on one monetization
strategy in your games?

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.290
And what can you learn
from other genres?

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.580
And what can you learn
from other developers?

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.530
So today I'm going to talk
about why diversify monetization

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.560
strategies in mobile games.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.310
Then I'm going to
discuss different trends

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.857
around this topic.

00:01:28.857 --> 00:01:30.690
And then I'm going to
finish with Gram Games

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.970
on stage who are going to
share with us their journey

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.180
of revenue diversification.

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.750
So why diversify?

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.330
As Markowitz said, by
diversifying revenue streams,

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.790
you're actually decreasing
the risk you have in games.

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.498
But more than that,
you have more options

00:01:46.498 --> 00:01:48.000
to monetize your
audience, which can

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.620
create an uplift in revenue.

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.180
Another reason is based
on the Google Play data.

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.030
And it's actually the first time
we are showing that on stage.

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.890
So let's take a look.

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.290
What you see in the
graph in the x-axis

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.930
is the percentage of
revenue coming from top 5%

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.150
of spenders in the game.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.640
What you see in the
y-axis is the reactivation

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.889
rate of churn
bias, or how likely

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:13.555
is the game to get
back churn bias.

00:02:13.555 --> 00:02:14.180
Take a picture.

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.230
That's a good one.

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.755
And what we found
out in our data

00:02:17.755 --> 00:02:19.880
that we actually have a
correlation between the two

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.030
things.

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.190
So if you look at the
bottom right corner,

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.607
you see that games that are
really concentrated on revenue

00:02:25.607 --> 00:02:28.490
from the top 5% of spenders
they have are actually less

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.010
likely to get back churn bias.

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.320
On the other hand, if you
look at the top left corner,

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.380
on the star sign,
you see that games

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:36.880
that are really
good at getting back

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.040
churn buyers are less dependent
on the top 5% of spenders

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.710
they have.

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:45.590
So what that means is that
trying to get $1 from a larger

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.110
audience is actually more
sustainable in trying to get

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:49.740
$100 from a high value user.

00:02:53.227 --> 00:02:55.060
so what trends do we
see around monetization

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.570
and diversification?

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.850
Subscriptions,
rewarded ads, and IAP.

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.030
So subscription is quite
new in mobile games.

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.102
But rewarded ads and
IAP are not new per se.

00:03:05.102 --> 00:03:06.810
We saw some interesting
trends with them.

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.830
And we are going to
discuss that later.

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.720
But let's start
with subscriptions.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.870
So who is using
subscriptions in the games.

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.260
Please raise your hand.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:14.760
OK.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.970
Yeah.

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:15.540
A few hands.

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.093
That makes sense.

00:03:17.093 --> 00:03:19.260
And subscription is not a
foreign concept in gaming.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.677
We've seen that
on PC and console.

00:03:20.677 --> 00:03:23.412
But it's actually quite a
new concept in mobile games.

00:03:23.412 --> 00:03:24.870
And we see more
and more developers

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.850
who are using this
strategy on top of the IAP

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.190
they have in their game in
order to create the premium

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.758
experience for users.

00:03:31.758 --> 00:03:34.050
And actually, on Google Play
we see a growing momentum,

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.240
with more than 70%
year on year growth

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:37.500
in subscribers and games.

00:03:40.117 --> 00:03:41.700
And developers are
using this strategy

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.980
and reporting different
benefits of doing so.

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.010
So [INAUDIBLE],, for example,
reported that subscribers

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.540
pay 20% more than they used to.

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.090
And Scopely reported that
subscribers have much higher

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.590
LTV.

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.053
And another reason of
using subscriptions

00:03:58.053 --> 00:03:59.720
is that it can actually
help you diffuse

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.900
the feeling of regrets in game.

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.270
So what happens sometimes
is that users binge on IAP,

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:06.190
and then they feel
regret doing so.

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.870
But if you use subscriptions,
you can actually change that.

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.290
So instead of eating all the
Halloween candies in one day,

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.020
user will eat one candy each
day for a long period of time.

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:18.790
And then they feel
rested while doing so.

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:21.930
So how to design
subscription experience?

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.030
So that's something that
requires a mindset shift.

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.760
You can use your IAP SKUs,
repackage them, and offer them

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.020
as subscription bundles.

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:29.460
It can actually work for you.

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.833
But we think that you
can do more than that.

00:04:31.833 --> 00:04:34.000
But while IAP is more about
the ownership of things,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.470
users are paying to own and
keep something in the game,

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:39.600
subscription is more about the
access to a premium experience,

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.190
access users can
gain and also lose.

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:46.373
And you have two main use cases
for subscriptions in games.

00:04:46.373 --> 00:04:48.540
The first one is to convert
new buyers often looking

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:49.630
for really good deals.

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:51.585
So if you take a
look at the example,

00:04:51.585 --> 00:04:54.450
see that Scopely on
top of the IAP deal

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:56.550
are offering really
exclusive rewards, like loss

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.012
protection in the game,
and also higher data caps.

00:04:59.012 --> 00:05:01.470
And they're offering this bundle
very early on in the game,

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:03.678
just after a first
time user experience.

00:05:03.678 --> 00:05:06.220
And the idea behind that is they
are trying to also make sure

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.040
that new buyers will
stay longer in the game

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.082
and play longer sessions.

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.970
And second use case
for a subscription

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:19.250
is to create a loyalty program
for your most valuable users.

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:21.745
So these users are often looking
for a premium experience,

00:05:21.745 --> 00:05:23.620
rewards for the commitment
they have to game,

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:26.220
and also a prestige feeling.

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.480
And in the examples
[INAUDIBLE] for the VIP

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.370
users are offering quite a lot.

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:32.590
Extra currency,
exclusive tournaments,

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:35.303
early access to new content, and
access to a special durables.

00:05:35.303 --> 00:05:36.220
So that's quite a lot.

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:42.260
So that was subscriptions.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.925
And let's move to rewarded ads.

00:05:44.925 --> 00:05:45.800
So is it a new trend?

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.850
You are obviously
asking yourself

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:49.350
why I'm speaking
about rewarded ads.

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:51.710
So it's not a new
monetization model.

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:54.097
We've seen that for a
couple of years now.

00:05:54.097 --> 00:05:56.180
But what the Google Ad Mob
team found out recently

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:59.480
in the research they did is
that IP heavy developers who

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.820
didn't focus on ads
before are starting

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.388
to rethink the monetization
strategy they have in games.

00:06:04.388 --> 00:06:05.930
And as a result,
they're implementing

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:07.523
more and more rewarded ads.

00:06:07.523 --> 00:06:09.440
And that's why you see
more hybrid games today

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.630
in the industry, in
both IAP and rewarded

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:12.770
ads implemented in them.

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:16.660
So why use rewarded ads?

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:19.460
So we have a couple
of reasons for that.

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:22.090
First of all, you can
monetize your non-paying users

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:23.435
with rewarded ads.

00:06:23.435 --> 00:06:25.060
You actually give
your users the option

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:27.550
to choose the currency they
would like to pay with,

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:30.180
time or money.

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:31.680
It can also increase
your engagement

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.552
in the game of both
payers and non payers.

00:06:33.552 --> 00:06:35.760
Users are getting back more
frequently into the game,

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:37.010
and also play longer sessions.

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:43.445
And the third key reason
of using rewarded ads--

00:06:43.445 --> 00:06:45.070
and you may not be
familiar with that--

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:48.620
is that it can actually predict
IAP conversion in games.

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:51.070
So what Kongregate found
out recently in their games

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:54.160
is that new users who watch an
ad in the first ever session

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.020
they're having in
the game are actually

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:58.300
much more likely to
make an in-app purchase.

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:00.840
And they saw an uptick
of between 250% to 500%

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:03.230
in that conversion rate,
which is really amazing.

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:08.960
So how to design a
rewarded ads experience?

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:10.790
We know it can be a bit tricky.

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:12.890
So we're showing you an
Ad Mob framework that

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:14.750
can help you in the process.

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:16.250
So you need to think
about placement

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:20.232
of the ads, user targeting,
cadence, and measurement.

00:07:22.545 --> 00:07:24.170
And let's see what
Kongregate are doing

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:26.370
for each one of these points.

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:29.540
So first of all, the ads should
be part of a game economy

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:31.310
design, and should
give something

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:32.752
meaningful to your users.

00:07:32.752 --> 00:07:35.210
But at the same time, make sure
it doesn't compete directly

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:37.890
with your IAP.

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:39.900
And every user should
have access to the ads.

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:42.450
But if you decide to remove
this access to paying users,

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:46.200
don't forget to give
them their rewards.

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:48.000
And more is not always better.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.570
They found out that between six
to eight ads per user per day

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:54.620
is the best practice.

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:57.220
And lastly, don't forget to
measure important metrics,

00:07:57.220 --> 00:07:59.720
like ad viewership
and frequency,

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:01.730
because you can segment
your users with that,

00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:03.950
and optimize the
performance of each segment.

00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:07.690
OK.

00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:10.700
So let's talk about
IAP a little bit.

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:14.650
So what we see with IAP
is very similar to what

00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:16.135
we see with rewarded ads.

00:08:16.135 --> 00:08:17.650
An increasing
number of developers

00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:20.620
who didn't focus on IAP
before and really focus on ads

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:23.290
are starting to
shift that focus.

00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:25.690
And they're either implementing
IAP in existing titles,

00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:28.420
or started to develop new IAP
based games for the first time.

00:08:30.918 --> 00:08:33.376
Tapps Games, for example, a
Brazilian company, really known

00:08:33.376 --> 00:08:36.350
for hyper casual games,
decided to double down

00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:38.392
IAP in the "Bid Wars"
titles, which are

00:08:38.392 --> 00:08:39.559
auction like strategy games.

00:08:39.559 --> 00:08:40.945
Rally nice games.

00:08:40.945 --> 00:08:43.070
And they've been working
very closely with the Play

00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:44.700
team in their time on that.

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:47.770
And in less than two years, they
saw an uptick of more than 200%

00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:48.770
in IP revenue.

00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:51.703
So that was a game
changer for the company.

00:08:51.703 --> 00:08:54.245
And as a result, IAP today is
part of the company's strategy.

00:08:57.825 --> 00:09:01.940
So why developers are looking
to diversify with IAP?

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:04.010
So first of all,
successful IAP games

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:06.320
can be mentioned and developed
by really small teams,

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:08.540
and simple operation
for structures.

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:10.173
In some cases,
we're seeing teams

00:09:10.173 --> 00:09:12.590
as small as 10 people who are
responsible for multimillion

00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:15.100
success stories.

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:18.370
IAP games also rely less on
massive number of installs.

00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:20.580
So instead of focusing
on game launches,

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:23.170
they're actually shifting focus
to more long term sustainable

00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:26.470
KPIs, like game engagement.

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:28.360
And IAP games are also
all about taking back

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:30.220
control of your own
revenue, instead of

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:33.552
depending on other companies
to provide you this revenue.

00:09:33.552 --> 00:09:35.260
And if you have the
right tools in place,

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.177
you have the flexibility
of testing, changing,

00:09:37.177 --> 00:09:38.520
and optimizing your game.

00:09:41.752 --> 00:09:43.210
So for those of
you who are looking

00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:44.918
to diversify with IAP
for the first time,

00:09:44.918 --> 00:09:46.378
really double down on that.

00:09:46.378 --> 00:09:47.920
That's a basic
framework for you that

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:49.840
can help you in this process.

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:52.340
So first of all, you need to
think about game economy design

00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:54.850
very early on in the development
process, because it's

00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:56.080
part of a core gameplay loop.

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:58.010
So don't forget that.

00:09:58.010 --> 00:10:00.490
Then think how to convert
users to be paying users,

00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:03.550
or how to create the value for
money perception in your game.

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:05.800
And lastly, you need to think
how to retain your users

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:07.540
and repeat the purchase events.

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:09.962
Basically shifting the
focus from a one time event,

00:10:09.962 --> 00:10:11.920
a game launch, to treat
your game as a service.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.990
And we asked Yodo1, to
[INAUDIBLE] publisher,

00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:19.390
to share with us some
insights on this framework.

00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:21.140
And the reason we asked
Yodo1 is that they

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:23.760
have an amazing story.

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:25.970
They're also known for
hyper casual games.

00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:28.222
And they have a leading
title, "Rodeo Stampede."

00:10:28.222 --> 00:10:29.805
How many of you know
"Rodeo Stampede?"

00:10:29.805 --> 00:10:30.960
It's a pretty known game.

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:31.460
Yeah.

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:32.280
OK.

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:34.920
And they decided to double
down IAP in that game.

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:36.600
In less than a
year, they managed

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:39.050
to shift the ads to
IAP ratio in the game.

00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:41.190
So IAP today, 60%
of the revenue.

00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:43.650
And only a couple of
months ago, it was 30%.

00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:45.150
And they shared
with us some insight

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:48.510
that can help you also
to think about IAP.

00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:51.480
So first of all, you need
to keep your design very

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:54.240
simple at first, because
then you can add more layers,

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:56.157
and change that
quite easy later on.

00:10:56.157 --> 00:10:57.740
But at the same time,
try and monetize

00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:00.377
as much users as you can by
using different currencies.

00:11:00.377 --> 00:11:02.460
So they're using an ad
currency in the game world,

00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:04.200
and also an IP
currency that targets

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:07.230
different type of users.

00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:09.480
And they found out that in
order to convert more users

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:11.220
to be paying users,
it's really valuable

00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:13.360
to understand what is
unique about each segment,

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:14.985
and what excites them
in the game, what

00:11:14.985 --> 00:11:17.610
does staying and playing a
longer session in the game?

00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:20.250
Because then you can create
targeted offerings, which

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:21.915
makes sense for each segment.

00:11:24.413 --> 00:11:26.830
And last, it's really important
to invest in more content,

00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:28.970
either by deepening the
content you already have--

00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:31.210
so if you have characters,
add more of them--

00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:33.800
or by adding more system
and features to the game.

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:36.040
In order to create a live
ops plan, with many events

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:37.540
and promotions,
it's really valuable

00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:39.627
to have a system that
you can customize,

00:11:39.627 --> 00:11:41.710
because then you don't
need to invest so much time

00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:43.543
and effort in each
event, in each promotion.

00:11:43.543 --> 00:11:45.430
And you can do much
more with much less.

00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:49.520
OK.

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:54.740
So we discussed very briefly
subscriptions, rewarded ads,

00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:56.110
and IAP.

00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:58.883
And I gave you a small glimpse
into new opportunities,

00:11:58.883 --> 00:12:00.800
hopefully to you to have
meaningful discussion

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:03.160
with your team
about monetization.

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:05.830
Ask your team, is the
current status quo

00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:09.430
you have in your company
your best strategy?

00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:12.650
And now I want to welcome
on stage Eren, who

00:12:12.650 --> 00:12:15.220
is going to share with us the
really amazing journey of Gram

00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:17.860
Games around revenue
diversification.

00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:20.560
So please welcome him on stage.

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:21.060
Yeah?

00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:21.560
Thank you.

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:23.864
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:43.680
So let me just introduce
you before we start.

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:45.210
EREN YANIK: Sure.

00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:48.520
ADI HADDAD: So Eren is the chief
revenue officer of Gram Games.

00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:51.040
He joined the company
two years ago.

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:53.700
Before that he was a
senior manager at McKinsey.

00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:55.735
And at Gram Games, he is
leading the production,

00:12:55.735 --> 00:12:57.300
monetization of the company.

00:12:57.300 --> 00:12:59.400
And he also led the
transformation of the company

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:02.130
from an ad revenue based
company to a majority IAP

00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:04.150
revenue based company.

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:06.453
So really thanks for
joining the talk.

00:13:06.453 --> 00:13:07.370
EREN YANIK: Thank you.

00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:08.912
ADI HADDAD: I really
appreciate that.

00:13:08.912 --> 00:13:11.070
So let's dive into
the first question.

00:13:11.070 --> 00:13:12.180
EREN YANIK: Sure.

00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:12.862
ADI HADDAD: Can you
tell the audience

00:13:12.862 --> 00:13:14.125
a little bit about Gram Games.

00:13:14.125 --> 00:13:14.420
EREN YANIK: Sure.

00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:16.320
ADI HADDAD: What kind
of games do you have?

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:18.450
EREN YANIK: So Gram
Games was primarily

00:13:18.450 --> 00:13:23.640
founded as a company that
makes quick games, make them

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:28.320
fast, iterate fast, fail
fast, and then launch them

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:30.930
to the market separately,
with lean teams.

00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:34.950
That's why initially they
focused on ad based games,

00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:36.090
like hyper casual games.

00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:40.470
I think so far we have about
nine games in our portfolio.

00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:43.260
And eight of them
are close to fully ad

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:47.040
funded, and hyper
casual to casual games.

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:51.910
The most famous ones
being "1010" and "Six!"

00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:56.500
Building on that, we
have recently, last year,

00:13:56.500 --> 00:14:02.900
launched "Merge Dragons," which
is right now 95% IAP based.

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:06.370
So we have shifted, even
though using the core loops

00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:08.500
and mechanics that exist
in hyper casual games,

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:11.620
we have actually
successfully transitioned

00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:15.550
into a more IAP
majority revenue source.

00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:19.690
So right now we're probably
more than 60% IAP revenues

00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:24.240
as a studio, and 30%
to 40% ad revenues.

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:25.990
ADI HADDAD: So we've
been working together

00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:27.190
for a couple of months now.

00:14:27.190 --> 00:14:29.680
And we had different
discussions on that decision

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:31.600
to diversify with IAP.

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:34.480
So can you share with the crowd
a little bit why you did it,

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:36.470
what were the reasons
behind that decision,

00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:37.902
and when did it happen?

00:14:37.902 --> 00:14:38.860
EREN YANIK: Sure thing.

00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:44.270
So ads business is,
I mean, in my view,

00:14:44.270 --> 00:14:47.440
it's very useful if
you're one of the two.

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:51.280
Like you're either a small
company, small studio,

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:54.430
with people that
focus on quick games,

00:14:54.430 --> 00:14:56.950
smaller games,
launching them fast,

00:14:56.950 --> 00:14:59.530
like the initial stage
that we used to be.

00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:03.670
Or if you are a publisher
that can really churn out,

00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:05.290
can really produce
games really fast,

00:15:05.290 --> 00:15:07.480
like one game a
week or something,

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:11.360
and you can rely on publishing,
other studios to help you.

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:14.410
But if you're somewhere
in the middle,

00:15:14.410 --> 00:15:18.160
probably focusing on
one game or a few games,

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:21.370
and focusing on a more
stable revenue source

00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:24.970
that is not affected
seasonally, or that does not

00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:28.780
rely on other intermediaries
between yourselves and players.

00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:31.000
Because ad revenues,
you can't really

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.060
control what ads people see.

00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:37.330
You can't really control the
volatility on the ad revenues.

00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:42.580
So you can only manage it by
increasing your number of games

00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:44.060
as the business grows.

00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:48.470
So that was the core reason
why we wanted to switch.

00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:50.570
And we have used
our Merge Mechanic

00:15:50.570 --> 00:15:52.450
that we developed
in other games,

00:15:52.450 --> 00:15:53.920
like "Merged" and "Merge Town."

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:55.630
And we used it in
our "Merge Dragons."

00:15:55.630 --> 00:15:58.400
It was the core of the game.

00:15:58.400 --> 00:15:59.980
But we've used it.

00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:02.860
We merged it with a camp
so that people actually

00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:05.980
have items that
they've merged up,

00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:09.350
and items that they
actually wanted to keep.

00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:12.670
So has then turned into a
higher retention, higher

00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:17.877
engagement, higher
output game eventually.

00:16:17.877 --> 00:16:19.960
ADI HADDAD: And when did
it happen, that decision?

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:23.380
EREN YANIK: So this was
around early last year.

00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:27.910
This was around actually
end of 2016 probably.

00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:30.520
So at that point, we had
three casual hyper games.

00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:33.070
And we had realized that
every new game actually

00:16:33.070 --> 00:16:35.830
boosted your revenue, but
the exponential growth

00:16:35.830 --> 00:16:36.560
was not there.

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:38.830
It was almost more linear.

00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:40.390
So what happened
was we decided to go

00:16:40.390 --> 00:16:42.280
to the next stage
we need to have

00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:43.630
a game on top grossing charts.

00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:47.808
We need to have a game that
has a stable number of DAU,

00:16:47.808 --> 00:16:49.600
people that you acquire
and stick with you.

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:51.520
It's not like the
leech bucket example.

00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:54.070
Like people actually go
in and then they leave.

00:16:54.070 --> 00:16:57.400
We wanted the more longer
term engagement with them.

00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:03.920
And then we have decided to open
up a studio in London actually.

00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:07.869
So up until that time
we were in Istanbul.

00:17:07.869 --> 00:17:11.200
And we set up the company
and hired everybody

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:12.980
we hired at that point there.

00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:17.170
But to do the switch
into IAP, you also

00:17:17.170 --> 00:17:19.790
need people who have
done this before,

00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:24.760
and people with more
expertise, more experience.

00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:27.940
And then London
overall is a city

00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:30.430
that's very attractive,
that you can actually

00:17:30.430 --> 00:17:33.100
have these people join
you, join the team,

00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:34.430
and then work on this game.

00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:35.770
So that's what we did.

00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:38.710
And launched "Merge Dragons"
from our London office,

00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:40.630
from our London studio.

00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:45.050
And we launched it
in June of last year.

00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:48.340
So from then on,
constantly iterated

00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:50.830
the game, added new features.

00:17:50.830 --> 00:17:53.170
Even today, I think
the LTV is probably

00:17:53.170 --> 00:17:56.530
three times what it used to
be when we first launched it.

00:17:56.530 --> 00:17:57.940
ADI HADDAD: So
other than opening

00:17:57.940 --> 00:18:00.610
an office in London, what
were the next steps following

00:18:00.610 --> 00:18:01.383
that decision.

00:18:01.383 --> 00:18:03.050
What did you need to
change the company?

00:18:03.050 --> 00:18:06.530
What did you need to
start from scratch?

00:18:06.530 --> 00:18:08.050
EREN YANIK: I mean,
at that point,

00:18:08.050 --> 00:18:10.690
so we knew what we were good at.

00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:14.920
And we knew what we required
to also improve on our side.

00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:19.750
Like we were people, Gram
Games, with the exception of me,

00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:23.760
is a very developer
oriented management base.

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:27.330
So I think we were very good
in like going to the code.

00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:29.283
Let's work on this
for two nights, then

00:18:29.283 --> 00:18:30.200
get it out of the way.

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:31.660
Let's just have
like four Red Bulls

00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:34.470
and then do this
type of a mindset.

00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:40.510
But I think we did not have
the ideas about the business

00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:44.120
management, the layers, and the
typical performance management.

00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:46.630
So up until that
point, we said, let's

00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:49.630
keep the culture we built.
Let's keep the good things

00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:52.267
about having a startup mindset.

00:18:52.267 --> 00:18:54.850
And it's the type of people that
when something stops working,

00:18:54.850 --> 00:18:56.960
they always open it up
and see, what's wrong?

00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:57.820
Like tinkering.

00:18:57.820 --> 00:19:00.440
Like always going
into the details.

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:03.010
So we tried to get people who
shared this vision, shared

00:19:03.010 --> 00:19:06.430
this mindset, but with people
who also have done this

00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:07.820
previously with the IAP games.

00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:10.580
So not to reinvent the
wheel, so to speak.

00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:13.210
So that's what we
tried to bring in.

00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:18.310
And we also brought maybe about
10 people from our Istanbul

00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:22.810
studio to London, and then hired
around 20 more people directly

00:19:22.810 --> 00:19:23.750
to our London office.

00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:25.840
But these people
are people who have

00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:27.730
worked on level
designers, people who have

00:19:27.730 --> 00:19:29.710
worked on character designs.

00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:32.610
For an IAP game, these
things really matter.

00:19:32.610 --> 00:19:35.260
In a hyper casual, I
think, the core thing

00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:37.450
is, do you give enough
feedback to the players,

00:19:37.450 --> 00:19:39.370
or is it really enough
differentiation?

00:19:39.370 --> 00:19:41.920
But you don't
really focus on when

00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:44.170
you level up does the
character get very different?

00:19:44.170 --> 00:19:46.530
Or you don't really focus
on a longer term engagement.

00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:51.190
But you focus on your
retention metrics, like D1, D7.

00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:52.990
So we hired people
with this expertise

00:19:52.990 --> 00:19:56.800
and combined them, while
trying to maintain our company

00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:57.310
culture.

00:19:57.310 --> 00:20:00.370
And it seemed to
work well I guess.

00:20:00.370 --> 00:20:02.560
ADI HADDAD: And can you
share a little bit more

00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:06.490
about what exactly is different
in developing an IAP based game

00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:08.020
compared to an ad based game?

00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:11.390
What kind of metrics do you
look at when you do that?

00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:17.410
EREN YANIK: I think it almost
feels to us, like an IAP

00:20:17.410 --> 00:20:23.170
game feels closer to
making a movie than almost

00:20:23.170 --> 00:20:24.450
making a hyper casual game.

00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:26.920
I mean, it's a very
extreme example.

00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:32.420
But we made "1010"
in actually 10 hours.

00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:34.450
So it was a hyper casual game.

00:20:34.450 --> 00:20:37.600
But I think it literally
took like a Thursday

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:40.900
morning, an idea, and by
Thursday evening the game

00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:41.480
was ready.

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:42.480
We put it on the market.

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:45.490
We saw good numbers, and
then we launched the game.

00:20:45.490 --> 00:20:47.920
But IAP is a different story.

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:52.840
Because you don't
really make your money

00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:54.280
based on your averages.

00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:57.070
You make money
based on your tail.

00:20:57.070 --> 00:20:59.740
What that means is on
a hyper casual game,

00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:02.710
you actually see D1
retention, D7 retention.

00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:06.520
What's our average revenue
per our user per day?

00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:09.190
Whereas in an IAP game,
at the end of the day

00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:12.420
you focus on the top 5% of
your most engaged players.

00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:16.090
So your average
player is not directly

00:21:16.090 --> 00:21:18.210
correlated with your
average revenue.

00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:21.030
So you actually care
about your top 5%,

00:21:21.030 --> 00:21:22.950
top 10% of your engaged players.

00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:24.700
How is their experience?

00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:26.280
So comments matter more.

00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:27.510
Ratings matter more.

00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:29.550
Communities matter more.

00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:30.450
All of these things.

00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:33.540
Like one rating
or one review you

00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:38.290
read somewhere could have really
extensive implications for you.

00:21:38.290 --> 00:21:41.070
So that's why you need
to be very much more,

00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:43.150
I think, almost iterative.

00:21:43.150 --> 00:21:46.740
In a hyper casual game
it's almost like trading,

00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:49.230
like you acquire users.

00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:50.800
They play the game
for a few days.

00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:51.300
They leave.

00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:52.950
And then you watch that.

00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:57.300
Whereas in an IAP game with
a higher long term retention,

00:21:57.300 --> 00:22:00.180
it becomes like an
overall experience almost.

00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:03.840
Like how is this person
now on their day 35?

00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:06.540
What type of dragons they
see, what type of items

00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:07.980
they interact with?

00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:11.070
We always have like our
junior, mid, high level

00:22:11.070 --> 00:22:13.800
player, where they're at
when they're experienced,

00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:16.643
how much more time are
they expected to spend?

00:22:16.643 --> 00:22:18.060
What is their level
of engagement?

00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:19.020
How is that varying?

00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:22.200
So those things
are very different.

00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:25.500
What we tried to bring them
in from our past experience

00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:28.110
with hyper casual games
is, it's very hard

00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:30.440
to launch an IAP game fast.

00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:33.370
And we're not still
perfect at it.

00:22:33.370 --> 00:22:36.330
But what you can do
is you could take

00:22:36.330 --> 00:22:38.220
certain loops and
certain mechanics

00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:42.110
that you know that work,
put them out first, and then

00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:43.980
D1, D7, see how they do.

00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:48.660
Like set more
intermediary expectations,

00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:51.900
KPIs on what you
think you should have.

00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:53.990
And only then, act on it.

00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:56.190
That, for us, is the similarity.

00:22:56.190 --> 00:23:01.020
But the core difference is more
about engagement rather than

00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:01.870
averages.

00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:02.495
ADI HADDAD: OK.

00:23:02.495 --> 00:23:05.168
And in retrospect, other than
the acquisition by Zynga,

00:23:05.168 --> 00:23:06.960
were you happy with
what happened following

00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:08.578
the launch of "Merge Dragons?"

00:23:08.578 --> 00:23:09.870
EREN YANIK: We were very happy.

00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:18.210
And I think even
internally, you share things

00:23:18.210 --> 00:23:20.310
at a different level
with your players

00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:23.370
when it's a more immersive game.

00:23:23.370 --> 00:23:26.760
Because I don't how many people
here played "1010" or "Six!",

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:29.970
but those are the games
that you don't feel--

00:23:29.970 --> 00:23:33.090
like you're never like
a crazy "1010" fan.

00:23:33.090 --> 00:23:36.420
Like it's the type of game you
would play that wouldn't really

00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:37.245
intimidate you.

00:23:37.245 --> 00:23:39.120
You would play it for
a few minutes in a day,

00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:41.590
and then put your phone down.

00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:44.130
But in "Merge Dragons,"
you really see

00:23:44.130 --> 00:23:46.290
people who are
fans of that game,

00:23:46.290 --> 00:23:49.540
even more than you are, as
the person who made the game.

00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:50.170
Right.

00:23:50.170 --> 00:23:53.740
You see people who draw,
submit dragon requests, who

00:23:53.740 --> 00:24:00.390
have ideas, who spent many
hours on a day on that game.

00:24:00.390 --> 00:24:03.240
Those things really, I
think, emotional fulfillment

00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:06.270
is much higher, in that sense.

00:24:06.270 --> 00:24:08.670
The teams that work on it,
the ownership they feel

00:24:08.670 --> 00:24:10.010
is also much higher.

00:24:10.010 --> 00:24:12.000
I think on hyper
casual, it's more almost

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:13.440
about like, you make a game.

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:13.950
Try it.

00:24:13.950 --> 00:24:14.450
Ship it.

00:24:14.450 --> 00:24:17.592
And it's almost like you have no
personal connection whatsoever,

00:24:17.592 --> 00:24:19.800
because there's a high chance
that that game will not

00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:20.370
be launched.

00:24:20.370 --> 00:24:23.370
Whereas in an IAP game
it's about the feature

00:24:23.370 --> 00:24:23.970
you're adding.

00:24:23.970 --> 00:24:25.530
What about if we
add this chest here?

00:24:25.530 --> 00:24:27.240
What happens if we
add the ship here,

00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:31.110
and that brings
goodies to our players?

00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:33.800
It's much more of a
deeper discussion.

00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:35.790
And it's a live product
at the end of the day.

00:24:35.790 --> 00:24:36.695
Yeah.

00:24:36.695 --> 00:24:37.320
ADI HADDAD: OK.

00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:40.050
So we need to close that
part of the session.

00:24:40.050 --> 00:24:41.150
It was really interesting.

00:24:41.150 --> 00:24:44.670
So thank you, Eren, for
sharing that with the audience.

00:24:44.670 --> 00:24:47.410
And just to conclude
this session, which

00:24:47.410 --> 00:24:49.410
is a little bit about
diversifying your revenue

00:24:49.410 --> 00:24:49.950
streams.

00:24:49.950 --> 00:24:52.720
And if you have any questions,
and if you need help with that,

00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:54.960
feel free to reach out to
Google Play team members.

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:57.130
And we'll be happy to
help you with that.

00:24:57.130 --> 00:24:59.100
And we have some time
for questions now.

00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:02.260
So we are open for
questions, if there are any.

00:25:02.260 --> 00:25:02.760
Yeah.

00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:04.430
Over there.

00:25:04.430 --> 00:25:06.150
Do you have a mic?

00:25:06.150 --> 00:25:08.230
No.

00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:09.210
Just a second.

00:25:09.210 --> 00:25:10.220
The mic is on the way.

00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:17.730
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:25:17.730 --> 00:25:19.580
Thanks for the talk.

00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:21.930
My question is, do you
believe that the combination

00:25:21.930 --> 00:25:24.420
of enough purchases and
enough advertisement

00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:27.000
is beneficial at all times?

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.920
Because what you can see
in the top grossing games,

00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:35.580
like strategy games,
over 70% rely totally

00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:37.370
on in-app purchases only.

00:25:37.370 --> 00:25:39.580
They don't have
in-app advertisement.

00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:42.310
So why do you think
they're doing it?

00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:45.540
And if you believe
that, perhaps,

00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:50.070
this in-app advertisement would
break their in-app purchases

00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:50.695
ecosystem?

00:25:50.695 --> 00:25:52.320
ADI HADDAD: Do you
want to answer that?

00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:54.540
EREN YANIK: Yeah.

00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:56.020
So a very good question.

00:25:56.020 --> 00:26:00.540
I mean, up until August
we did not have any ads

00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:02.300
on "Merge Dragons."

00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:04.400
So it was fully IAP based.

00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:06.380
In August we've added
the rewarded option.

00:26:09.870 --> 00:26:13.590
The ads revenues,
there's a bit of,

00:26:13.590 --> 00:26:16.920
I'd say almost a lack of
transparency on the way today

00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:19.480
you get your ad revenues
on a per player basis.

00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:23.220
Like you can't see
how much revenue you

00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:25.390
get for one of your players.

00:26:25.390 --> 00:26:27.720
So it's very hard to actually
allocate your ad revenues

00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:29.720
into players, and
then compare if it

00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:32.277
leads to any
cannibalization or not,

00:26:32.277 --> 00:26:33.610
because this person watches ads.

00:26:33.610 --> 00:26:36.570
So that's why you go
with manual filters.

00:26:36.570 --> 00:26:38.730
You either filter the
number of videos they see,

00:26:38.730 --> 00:26:41.188
or the number of players that
are able to watch the videos.

00:26:41.188 --> 00:26:43.590
If they make a payment,
they take them out

00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:45.000
of the rewarded video.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.610
What we did was we capped
the number of videos

00:26:47.610 --> 00:26:49.340
that people can watch.

00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:53.500
And only capped it, I think,
at two per our players.

00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:55.580
That's why for us, and we
could see the revenues,

00:26:55.580 --> 00:26:58.290
and it actually added an
incremental benefit to the time

00:26:58.290 --> 00:27:01.230
where we had the videos to
the time we did not have,

00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:04.110
versus the time where we had.

00:27:04.110 --> 00:27:06.420
And I think it's
a choice really.

00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:08.730
It depends also how you
monetize your player base,

00:27:08.730 --> 00:27:11.700
like where you want to
give that rewarded option

00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:12.840
to your players.

00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:16.250
To us it's been
beneficial so far.

00:27:16.250 --> 00:27:20.610
ADI HADDAD: We have one more
question if we have any.

00:27:20.610 --> 00:27:23.290
One more.

00:27:23.290 --> 00:27:23.790
No?

00:27:23.790 --> 00:27:25.740
Last chance.

00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:26.240
OK.

00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:26.740
Ah.

00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:27.265
Yeah.

00:27:27.265 --> 00:27:27.910
Over there.

00:27:27.910 --> 00:27:28.410
Yeah.

00:27:28.410 --> 00:27:28.910
Thank you.

00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:33.555
AUDIENCE: Two simple
questions, if possible.

00:27:33.555 --> 00:27:34.350
The first.

00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:37.890
What is the split in your
audience between women and men

00:27:37.890 --> 00:27:39.300
in "Merge Dragons?"

00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:42.440
And the second, how do
you, if it's possible,

00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:50.330
exactly track the numbers
of revenue from IAP

00:27:50.330 --> 00:27:54.444
and ads when you're
changing something?

00:27:57.220 --> 00:27:58.170
Thanks.

00:27:58.170 --> 00:27:59.220
EREN YANIK: Thank you.

00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:04.510
The men versus women
split, we don't

00:28:04.510 --> 00:28:07.030
collect extensive
information from our players.

00:28:07.030 --> 00:28:09.280
But based on, I
think, where we see

00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:11.410
with people who log
on using social media,

00:28:11.410 --> 00:28:13.960
we think it's around 65% female.

00:28:16.870 --> 00:28:23.240
And we don't do anything
specific about this.

00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:25.270
I think based on our
current marketing

00:28:25.270 --> 00:28:28.720
and currently what
we think is optimized

00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:31.640
marketing that this is the
audience that we ended up with.

00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:33.400
So it skews female.

00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:36.510
And the second
question was, I think,

00:28:36.510 --> 00:28:42.200
it was how do we
see ads versus IAPs.

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:44.700
ADI HADDAD: How do you see the
impact of change in the game?

00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:45.408
EREN YANIK: Yeah.

00:28:45.408 --> 00:28:48.490
So when we generally
add a new feature,

00:28:48.490 --> 00:28:53.320
we leave around a month
or longer testing periods.

00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:55.540
It's harder to do
the A/B test on ads.

00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:57.700
Because ads, again,
many things change.

00:28:57.700 --> 00:28:58.690
And it's hard.

00:28:58.690 --> 00:29:00.640
What we're lucky
with is that we have

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:02.330
eight other ad based games.

00:29:02.330 --> 00:29:03.940
So we can also compare
the ad revenue,

00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:06.100
the CPMs between those
games and this game.

00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:10.150
Like does it really change
when we change something?

00:29:10.150 --> 00:29:12.820
Does the ad revenue here
grow more than the others?

00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:17.110
IAP is generally easier to see,
like per player, where they're

00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:18.970
at in their game, you
could see if something

00:29:18.970 --> 00:29:22.340
increases or decreases, you
can track it more effectively.

00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:23.650
But ads, you have to group.

00:29:23.650 --> 00:29:27.070
That's the core problem.

00:29:27.070 --> 00:29:27.870
ADI HADDAD: OK.

00:29:27.870 --> 00:29:29.320
Thanks, everyone.

00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:29.862
Thanks, Eren.

00:29:29.862 --> 00:29:30.778
EREN YANIK: Thank you.

00:29:30.778 --> 00:29:32.940
ADI HADDAD: Hope it was
interesting for you guys.

00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:34.800
And that's it for that session.

00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:35.717
EREN YANIK: Thank you.

00:29:35.717 --> 00:29:37.850
[APPLAUSE]
