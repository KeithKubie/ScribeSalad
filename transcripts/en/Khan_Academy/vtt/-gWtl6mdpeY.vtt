00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.870
Construct a square
inscribed inside the circle.

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:06.550
And in order to do
this, we just have

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:08.863
to remember that a square,
what we know of a square

00:00:08.863 --> 00:00:11.120
is all four sides are
congruent and they

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.870
intersect at right angles.

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.830
And we also have to
remember that the two

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:18.470
diagonals of the
square are going

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.840
to be perpendicular
bisectors of each other.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.040
So let's see if we can
construct two lines that

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.570
are perpendicular
bisectors of each other.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.940
And essentially, where those
two lines intersect our bigger

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.730
circle, those are going to be
the vertices of our square.

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.430
So let's throw a straight
edge right over here.

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.340
And let's make a diameter.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.145
So that's a diameter
right over here.

00:00:43.145 --> 00:00:45.006
It just goes through
the circle, goes

00:00:45.006 --> 00:00:46.380
through the center
of the circle,

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.021
to two sides of the circle.

00:00:48.021 --> 00:00:49.395
And now, let's
think about how we

00:00:49.395 --> 00:00:52.290
can construct a perpendicular
bisector of this.

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.860
And we've done this in
other compass construction

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.550
or construction videos.

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.650
But what we can do is we
can put a circle-- let's

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.340
throw a circle right over here.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.297
We've got to make its radius
bigger than the center.

00:01:04.297 --> 00:01:06.630
And what we're going to do
is we're going to reuse this.

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:07.680
We're going to make
another circle that's

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:08.680
the exact same size.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:09.610
Put it there.

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.700
And where they intersect
is going to be exactly

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.450
along-- those two
points of intersection

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.310
are going to be along a
perpendicular bisector.

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.410
So that's one of them.

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:19.650
Let's do another one.

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.640
I want a circle of the
exact same dimensions.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.800
So I'll center it
at the same place.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.090
I'll drag it out there.

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:27.590
That looks pretty good.

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.890
I'll move it on to this side,
the other side of my diameter.

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.490
So that looks pretty good.

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.050
And notice, if I connect
that point to that point,

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.470
I will have constructed
a perpendicular bisector

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.520
of this original segment.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:41.380
So let's do that.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.150
Let's connect those two points.

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.390
So that point and that point.

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.150
And then, we could just
keep going all the way

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.580
to the end of the circle.

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.730
Go all the way over there.

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:59.160
That looks pretty good.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.970
And now, we just have
to connect these four

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.800
points to have a square.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.020
So let's do that.

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.640
So I'll connect
to that and that.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.940
And then I will connect, throw
another straight edge there.

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.650
I will connect that with that.

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.530
And then, two more to go.

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:29.980
I'll connect this with
that, and then one more.

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.470
I can connect this with
that, and there you go.

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.240
I have a shape whose vertices
intersect the circle.

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.060
And its diagonals, this diagonal
and this diagonal, these

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.335
are perpendicular bisectors.
