[Norvig] In this quiz we're going to consider each of the shuffle routines--

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
that is, the shuffle routine coming from Knuth, the Algorithm P,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
the shuffle1 that was the teacher's original shuffle,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and the shuffle2 and 3 that we just saw.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
And for each of them I want you to tell me,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
is the runtime order N or order N squared,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and is the result that we get back correct

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
in the sense that all outcomes are equally probable?

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
We already know that the shuffle routine is order N and it is correct,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and we know that shuffle1 is order N squared and it's not correct.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
And now what I want you to tell me is for shuffle2 and 3

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
what's the order of complexity, and is it correct?

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
