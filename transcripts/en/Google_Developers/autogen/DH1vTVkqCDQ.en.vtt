okay so um at the start of the web we we

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179
okay so um at the start of the web we we
 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:05.180
okay so um at the start of the web we we
had you know we just had tags you would

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190
had you know we just had tags you would
 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:06.590
had you know we just had tags you would
build your pages out of all of these

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600
build your pages out of all of these
 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.740
build your pages out of all of these
tags and some tags look differently to

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750
tags and some tags look differently to
 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.290
tags and some tags look differently to
others and there was no real reason for

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300
others and there was no real reason for
 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.970
others and there was no real reason for
that and since then we've had this

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980
that and since then we've had this
 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.480
that and since then we've had this
process of of trying to explain the

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490
process of of trying to explain the
 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.849
process of of trying to explain the
magic behind how pages are built up and

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859
magic behind how pages are built up and
 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.590
magic behind how pages are built up and
and then give that magic back to

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600
and then give that magic back to
 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.689
and then give that magic back to
developers you know so you can use that

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699
developers you know so you can use that
 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.009
developers you know so you can use that
magic to build different things so

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019
magic to build different things so
 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.170
magic to build different things so
example of that is the Dom explained the

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180
example of that is the Dom explained the
 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.689
example of that is the Dom explained the
the structure of pages a CSS explained

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699
the structure of pages a CSS explained
 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.580
the structure of pages a CSS explained
why like one heading was a different

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590
why like one heading was a different
 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:32.900
why like one heading was a different
side to another and you could use that

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910
side to another and you could use that
 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.270
side to another and you could use that
to style things differently but until

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280
to style things differently but until
 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.459
to style things differently but until
recently we couldn't really explain why

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469
recently we couldn't really explain why
 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.190
recently we couldn't really explain why
an input element look the way it did and

an input element look the way it did and
 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.110
an input element look the way it did and
behave the way it did and why like a

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120
behave the way it did and why like a
 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.209
behave the way it did and why like a

had a different set of behaviors well we

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539
had a different set of behaviors well we
 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.090
had a different set of behaviors well we
have a new explanation for that we've

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100
have a new explanation for that we've
 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.819

Wikipedia last night but to really

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070
Wikipedia last night but to really
 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:28.230
Wikipedia last night but to really
understand what polymer is you actually

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240
understand what polymer is you actually
 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.330
understand what polymer is you actually
have to take a step back in time to the

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340
have to take a step back in time to the
 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.070
have to take a step back in time to the
early days of the web in order to

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080
early days of the web in order to
 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.420
early days of the web in order to
understand what we're going you have to

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430
understand what we're going you have to
 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.370
understand what we're going you have to
understand where we've been so this is

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380
understand where we've been so this is
 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.050
understand where we've been so this is
what the web looks like today will

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060
what the web looks like today will
 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.120
what the web looks like today will
transport ourselves back in time to an

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130
transport ourselves back in time to an
 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:40.440
transport ourselves back in time to an
earlier day when the web look like this

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450
earlier day when the web look like this
 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.340
earlier day when the web look like this
or at least google com in 98 and this is

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350
or at least google com in 98 and this is
 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:45.540
or at least google com in 98 and this is
probably what your first webpage looked

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550
probably what your first webpage looked
 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.160
probably what your first webpage looked
like you had a couple of elements to

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170
like you had a couple of elements to
 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:48.360
like you had a couple of elements to
play with you had things like the form

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370
play with you had things like the form
 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.110
play with you had things like the form
tag you had selects you had dropdowns

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120
tag you had selects you had dropdowns
 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.080
tag you had selects you had dropdowns
you had list elements you know radio

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090
you had list elements you know radio
 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.570
you had list elements you know radio
buttons and so the platform is pretty

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580
buttons and so the platform is pretty
 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:58.920
buttons and so the platform is pretty
lymington what we could do but we didn't

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930
lymington what we could do but we didn't
 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.080
lymington what we could do but we didn't
really need anything more than that of

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090
really need anything more than that of
 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.440
really need anything more than that of
course since we're in the 90s we have

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450
course since we're in the 90s we have
 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.030

clippies second cousin which is
 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.590
clippies second cousin which is
selecting and he's telling us that we're

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600
selecting and he's telling us that we're
 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.930
selecting and he's telling us that we're
going to build a website today oh thank

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940
going to build a website today oh thank
 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.210
going to build a website today oh thank
you so actually select is a really

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220
you so actually select is a really
 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.980
you so actually select is a really
awesome element and it's worth actually

remember things like touch events

00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:14.120
remember things like touch events
 

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:15.850

we want to remove all that the last

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:19.490
we want to remove all that the last
 

00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:21.190

platform so if you have you know a hand

00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:23.240
platform so if you have you know a hand
 

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:24.700

on the steering wheel you have a hand on

00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:24.710
on the steering wheel you have a hand on
 

00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:26.050
on the steering wheel you have a hand on
the gear shifter but you always have

00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:26.060
the gear shifter but you always have
 

00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:28.120

your eyes sort of looking backwards you

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:28.130
your eyes sort of looking backwards you
 

00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:29.410
your eyes sort of looking backwards you
can ever really progress the platform

00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:29.420
can ever really progress the platform
 

00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:31.000
can ever really progress the platform
forward and really show you know

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:31.010
forward and really show you know
 

00:12:31.010 --> 00:12:33.400
forward and really show you know
developers and and the web what can be

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:33.410
developers and and the web what can be
 

00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:35.560

it's also very hard to polyfill things

00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:39.440
it's also very hard to polyfill things

like shadow Dom for for old IE so let's

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:44.930
like shadow Dom for for old IE so let's
 

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:46.120
like shadow Dom for for old IE so let's
talk about elements we're going to go up

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:46.130
talk about elements we're going to go up
 

00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:47.590
talk about elements we're going to go up
and talk about that that top layer of

00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:47.600
and talk about that that top layer of
 

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:50.200
and talk about that that top layer of
the stack and the mantra here if you

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:50.210
the stack and the mantra here if you
 

00:12:50.210 --> 00:12:51.610
the stack and the mantra here if you
remember is that everything is an

00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:51.620
remember is that everything is an
 

00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:56.200
remember is that everything is an
element everything is an element so what

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:56.210
element everything is an element so what
 

00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:57.370
element everything is an element so what
do we mean by everything is an element

00:12:57.370 --> 00:12:57.380
do we mean by everything is an element
 

00:12:57.380 --> 00:13:00.310
do we mean by everything is an element
well this is one example if Ajax was

00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:00.320
well this is one example if Ajax was
 

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:01.750
well this is one example if Ajax was
just part of the browser today you would

00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:01.760
just part of the browser today you would
 

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:03.400
just part of the browser today you would
probably use it as an element you

00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:03.410
probably use it as an element you
 

00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:04.390
probably use it as an element you
probably wouldn't write a lot of

00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:04.400
probably wouldn't write a lot of
 

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:06.400
probably wouldn't write a lot of
JavaScript code and so that's exactly

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:06.410
JavaScript code and so that's exactly
 

00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:07.870
JavaScript code and so that's exactly
the approach we taken with the polymer

00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:07.880
the approach we taken with the polymer
 

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:10.600
the approach we taken with the polymer
Ajax tag the way you can figure this tag

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:10.610
Ajax tag the way you can figure this tag
 

00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:13.420
Ajax tag the way you can figure this tag
is you give it a URL right just an HTML

00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:13.430
is you give it a URL right just an HTML
 

00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:15.370
is you give it a URL right just an HTML
attribute very akin to the Select

00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:15.380
attribute very akin to the Select
 

00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:17.110
attribute very akin to the Select
element you configuring this element

00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:17.120
element you configuring this element
 

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:18.670
element you configuring this element
using attributes it's all declarative

00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:18.680
using attributes it's all declarative
 

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:20.380
using attributes it's all declarative
and then you're passing in a parameters

00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:20.390
and then you're passing in a parameters
 

00:13:20.390 --> 00:13:21.970
and then you're passing in a parameters
attribute as well

00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:21.980
attribute as well
 

00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:23.020
attribute as well
with some additional parameters for that

00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:23.030
with some additional parameters for that
 

00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:25.390
with some additional parameters for that
URL and so instead of writing a bunch of

00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:25.400
URL and so instead of writing a bunch of
 

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:28.360
URL and so instead of writing a bunch of
xhr code every time I start an ass you

with that and i'm configuring it from

00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:33.140
with that and i'm configuring it from
 

00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:35.440
with that and i'm configuring it from
the outside via parameters attributes

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:35.450
the outside via parameters attributes
 

00:13:35.450 --> 00:13:37.630
the outside via parameters attributes
and I wire up a little bit of JavaScript

00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:37.640
and I wire up a little bit of JavaScript
 

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:39.550
and I wire up a little bit of JavaScript
just like the select element fires a

00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:39.560
just like the select element fires a
 

00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:40.930

fire a polymer response event and then I

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:45.230
fire a polymer response event and then I
 

00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:47.350
fire a polymer response event and then I
can subscribe to that fetch this element

00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:47.360
can subscribe to that fetch this element
 

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:49.930
can subscribe to that fetch this element
from the Dom subscribe to that and just

00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:49.940
from the Dom subscribe to that and just
 

00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:51.490
from the Dom subscribe to that and just
use the same techniques i'm used to json

00:13:51.490 --> 00:13:51.500
use the same techniques i'm used to json
 

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:53.260

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:02.090
interface so there's this go method that
 

00:14:02.090 --> 00:14:04.240
interface so there's this go method that
i can call and so this feels really good

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:04.250
i can call and so this feels really good
 

00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:05.560
i can call and so this feels really good
because i can reuse this each every time

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:05.570
because i can reuse this each every time

this for a long time but it's still very

00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:25.880
this for a long time but it's still very
 

00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:27.130
this for a long time but it's still very
intricate and you have to know a lot of

00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:27.140
intricate and you have to know a lot of
 

00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:29.350
intricate and you have to know a lot of
things about it so if you remember for

00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:29.360
things about it so if you remember for
 

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:30.940
things about it so if you remember for
the cases select right select was able

00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:30.950
the cases select right select was able
 

00:14:30.950 --> 00:14:32.410
the cases select right select was able
to rearrange its children give me some

default UI without much work at all on

00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:34.520
default UI without much work at all on
 

00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:36.220
default UI without much work at all on
the approach at the polymer team what

00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:36.230
the approach at the polymer team what
 

00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:38.470
the approach at the polymer team what
we've taken is let's make a polymer flex

00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:38.480
we've taken is let's make a polymer flex
 

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:40.060
we've taken is let's make a polymer flex
layout tag and inside of it it's

00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:40.070
layout tag and inside of it it's
 

00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:41.920
layout tag and inside of it it's
children just know to be flexed children

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:41.930
children just know to be flexed children
 

00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:44.110
children just know to be flexed children
and so now I can configure this tag with

00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:44.120
and so now I can configure this tag with
 

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:45.730
and so now I can configure this tag with
attributes so i can change vertical i

00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:45.740
attributes so i can change vertical i
 

00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:47.860
attributes so i can change vertical i
can just remove that attribute and the

00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:47.870
can just remove that attribute and the
 

00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:49.000
can just remove that attribute and the
element just knows what to do with its

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:49.010
element just knows what to do with its
 

00:14:49.010 --> 00:14:50.590
element just knows what to do with its
children and of course default back to a

00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:50.600
children and of course default back to a
 

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:53.710
children and of course default back to a
row representation i can i can toggle

00:14:53.710 --> 00:14:53.720
row representation i can i can toggle
 

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:55.360
row representation i can i can toggle
the Flex attribute on its children

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:55.370
the Flex attribute on its children
 

00:14:55.370 --> 00:14:57.730
the Flex attribute on its children
elements and of course it'll do the

00:14:57.730 --> 00:14:57.740
elements and of course it'll do the
 

00:14:57.740 --> 00:14:59.080
elements and of course it'll do the
right thing so it takes a lot of the

00:14:59.080 --> 00:14:59.090
right thing so it takes a lot of the
 

00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:01.090
right thing so it takes a lot of the
burden out of knowing you know some of

00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:01.100
burden out of knowing you know some of
 

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:02.500
burden out of knowing you know some of
these new technologies under the hood i

what it's supposed to do which is
 

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:11.410
what it's supposed to do which is
arranged my page in a certain way it's

00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:11.420
arranged my page in a certain way it's
 

00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:12.760
arranged my page in a certain way it's
kind of conceptually interesting to

00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:12.770
kind of conceptually interesting to
 

00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:13.990
kind of conceptually interesting to
think about elements that actually don't

00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:14.000
think about elements that actually don't
 

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.490
think about elements that actually don't
render anything so Ajax or it's not

00:15:15.490 --> 00:15:15.500
render anything so Ajax or it's not
 

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:17.290
render anything so Ajax or it's not
rendering something its utility elements

00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:17.300
rendering something its utility elements
 

00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:19.630
rendering something its utility elements
doing something on the page saying with

00:15:19.630 --> 00:15:19.640
doing something on the page saying with
 

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:20.980
doing something on the page saying with
the layouts doing something on the page

00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:20.990
the layouts doing something on the page
 

00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:22.630
the layouts doing something on the page
it's not actually showing me stuff and

00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:22.640
it's not actually showing me stuff and
 

00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:24.160
it's not actually showing me stuff and
we've been playing around with a lot of

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:24.170
we've been playing around with a lot of
 

00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:26.410
we've been playing around with a lot of
these none I call the non-visual utility

00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:26.420
these none I call the non-visual utility
 

00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:29.230
these none I call the non-visual utility
elements things like layout for CSS grid

00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:29.240
elements things like layout for CSS grid
 

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:31.360
elements things like layout for CSS grid
and flexbox we have a media query

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:31.370
and flexbox we have a media query
 

00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:33.160
and flexbox we have a media query
element that just handles you know doing

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:33.170
element that just handles you know doing
 

00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:34.900
element that just handles you know doing
media queries in firing events for that

00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:34.910
media queries in firing events for that
 

00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:37.360
media queries in firing events for that
just drop this in and reuse this and you

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:37.370
just drop this in and reuse this and you
 

00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:38.170
just drop this in and reuse this and you
don't have to worry about that stuff

00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:38.180
don't have to worry about that stuff
 

00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:40.930
don't have to worry about that stuff
anymore tags for dealing with a single

00:15:40.930 --> 00:15:40.940
anymore tags for dealing with a single
 

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:44.170
anymore tags for dealing with a single
page application or shared state polymer

00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:44.180
page application or shared state polymer
 

00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:45.760
page application or shared state polymer
local storage is actually pretty cool so

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:45.770
local storage is actually pretty cool so
 

00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:47.200
local storage is actually pretty cool so
you know if you tie this up to another

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:47.210
you know if you tie this up to another
 

00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:48.880
you know if you tie this up to another
element you get some change events you

00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:48.890
element you get some change events you
 

00:15:48.890 --> 00:15:50.590
element you get some change events you
pass some data using data binding to it

00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:50.600
pass some data using data binding to it
 

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:52.630
pass some data using data binding to it
and I'll show you example that and you

00:15:52.630 --> 00:15:52.640
and I'll show you example that and you
 

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:53.830
and I'll show you example that and you
persist data to local stores you'll have

00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:53.840
persist data to local stores you'll have
 

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:55.200
persist data to local stores you'll have
to worry about hooking that up yourself

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:55.210
to worry about hooking that up yourself
 

00:15:55.210 --> 00:15:58.000
to worry about hooking that up yourself
and then other things like polymer

00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:58.010
and then other things like polymer
 

00:15:58.010 --> 00:16:00.040
and then other things like polymer
signals being able to broadcast messages

00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:00.050
signals being able to broadcast messages
 

00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:01.450
signals being able to broadcast messages
to different components on the page or

00:16:01.450 --> 00:16:01.460
to different components on the page or
 

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:03.520
to different components on the page or
to the broader page so conception it's a

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:03.530
to the broader page so conception it's a
 

00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:04.870
to the broader page so conception it's a
little bit weird to like drop this stuff

00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:04.880
little bit weird to like drop this stuff
 

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:06.250
little bit weird to like drop this stuff
on your page and it doesn't like

00:16:06.250 --> 00:16:06.260
on your page and it doesn't like
 

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:08.170
on your page and it doesn't like
rendering a UI just for instance reads a

00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:08.180
rendering a UI just for instance reads a
 

00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:10.450
rendering a UI just for instance reads a
file what a tag that reads a file it's

00:16:10.450 --> 00:16:10.460
file what a tag that reads a file it's
 

00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:12.340
file what a tag that reads a file it's
crazy but once you get into the polymer

00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:12.350
crazy but once you get into the polymer
 

00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:13.990
crazy but once you get into the polymer
core it starts to really really make

00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:14.000
core it starts to really really make
 

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.160
core it starts to really really make
sense and on top of that we have a set

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:18.170
sense and on top of that we have a set
 

00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:20.020
sense and on top of that we have a set
of UI elements that we're working on so

00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:20.030
of UI elements that we're working on so
 

00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:21.070
of UI elements that we're working on so
this is what people think about when

00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:21.080
this is what people think about when
 

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:22.270
this is what people think about when
they think of components right the UI

00:16:22.270 --> 00:16:22.280
they think of components right the UI
 

00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:24.640
they think of components right the UI
that you plop on your page and you you

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:24.650
that you plop on your page and you you
 

00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:26.410
that you plop on your page and you you
know your usual suspects apply here we

00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:26.420
know your usual suspects apply here we
 

00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:29.200
know your usual suspects apply here we
have things like a polymer UI card and

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:29.210
have things like a polymer UI card and
 

00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:30.820
have things like a polymer UI card and
basically what you do is you drop this

00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:30.830
basically what you do is you drop this
 

00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:31.930
basically what you do is you drop this
on your page and you get things like

00:16:31.930 --> 00:16:31.940
on your page and you get things like
 

00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:33.970
on your page and you get things like
swiping functionality for free with

00:16:33.970 --> 00:16:33.980
swiping functionality for free with
 

00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:35.620
swiping functionality for free with
touch events and pointer events it's

00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:35.630
touch events and pointer events it's
 

00:16:35.630 --> 00:16:38.590
touch events and pointer events it's
pretty nice we have a sidebar menu item

00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:38.600
pretty nice we have a sidebar menu item
 

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:40.240
pretty nice we have a sidebar menu item
so you just drop this markup on your

00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:40.250
so you just drop this markup on your
 

00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:42.250
so you just drop this markup on your
page and you get a usual sort of site

00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:42.260
page and you get a usual sort of site
 

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:43.300
page and you get a usual sort of site
navigation with the little thing that

00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:43.310
navigation with the little thing that
 

00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:45.610
navigation with the little thing that
follows you and it's got animations it's

00:16:45.610 --> 00:16:45.620
follows you and it's got animations it's
 

00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:48.460
follows you and it's got animations it's
all 60 FPS but the really cool thing

00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:48.470
all 60 FPS but the really cool thing
 

00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:50.050
all 60 FPS but the really cool thing
about this is it's just a bunch of

00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:50.060
about this is it's just a bunch of
 

00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:51.520
about this is it's just a bunch of
markup right so I'm not writing any code

00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:51.530
markup right so I'm not writing any code
 

00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:53.590
markup right so I'm not writing any code
to actually reuse this element I'm just

00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:53.600
to actually reuse this element I'm just
 

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:56.200
to actually reuse this element I'm just
declaring polymer UI side menu on my

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:56.210
declaring polymer UI side menu on my
 

00:16:56.210 --> 00:16:58.660
declaring polymer UI side menu on my
page it's got attributes like selected

00:16:58.660 --> 00:16:58.670
page it's got attributes like selected
 

00:16:58.670 --> 00:17:00.760
page it's got attributes like selected
that I can figure it with labels so

00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:00.770
that I can figure it with labels so
 

00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:01.780
that I can figure it with labels so
we're using parts of the platform

00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:01.790
we're using parts of the platform
 

00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:04.480
we're using parts of the platform
already inside of it it knows what to do

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:04.490
already inside of it it knows what to do
 

00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:06.310
already inside of it it knows what to do
with its children and it is expects a

00:17:06.310 --> 00:17:06.320
with its children and it is expects a
 

00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:07.360
with its children and it is expects a
certain type of children respects

00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:07.370
certain type of children respects
 

00:17:07.370 --> 00:17:09.820
certain type of children respects
polymer UI sub menu item and so that's

00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:09.830
polymer UI sub menu item and so that's
 

00:17:09.830 --> 00:17:11.380
polymer UI sub menu item and so that's
what's rendering all this just a bunch

00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:11.390
what's rendering all this just a bunch
 

00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:12.760
what's rendering all this just a bunch
of tags so it's really easy as a

00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:12.770
of tags so it's really easy as a
 

00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:13.930
of tags so it's really easy as a
developer to know what's going on here

00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:13.940
developer to know what's going on here
 

00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:20.650
developer to know what's going on here
and to maintain and to use it's

00:17:20.650 --> 00:17:20.660
and to maintain and to use it's
 

00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:22.210
and to maintain and to use it's
important to note that web p bunch

00:17:22.210 --> 00:17:22.220
important to note that web p bunch
 

00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:23.830
important to note that web p bunch
really lend themselves very nicely to

00:17:23.830 --> 00:17:23.840
really lend themselves very nicely to
 

00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:26.290
really lend themselves very nicely to
compose ability and reusability so we're

00:17:26.290 --> 00:17:26.300
compose ability and reusability so we're
 

00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:27.640
compose ability and reusability so we're
actually using for a lot of the UI

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:27.650
actually using for a lot of the UI
 

00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:29.650
actually using for a lot of the UI
elements that we're creating we're using

00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:29.660
elements that we're creating we're using
 

00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:31.990
elements that we're creating we're using
these utility elements under the hood so

00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:32.000
these utility elements under the hood so
 

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.030
these utility elements under the hood so
for instance polymer selector is this

00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:34.040
for instance polymer selector is this
 

00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:35.500
for instance polymer selector is this
sort of selecting widget that manages

00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:35.510
sort of selecting widget that manages
 

00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:37.810
sort of selecting widget that manages
state and selecting those menu items and

00:17:37.810 --> 00:17:37.820
state and selecting those menu items and
 

00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:39.220
state and selecting those menu items and
so we're reusing stuff we don't to

00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:39.230
so we're reusing stuff we don't to
 

00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:40.540
so we're reusing stuff we don't to
reinvent the wheel each and every time

00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:40.550
reinvent the wheel each and every time
 

00:17:40.550 --> 00:17:42.340
reinvent the wheel each and every time
we start a new app we can just compose

00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:42.350
we start a new app we can just compose
 

00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:46.510
we start a new app we can just compose
an app out of components so this is the

00:17:46.510 --> 00:17:46.520
an app out of components so this is the
 

00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:48.520
an app out of components so this is the
world we're creating we hope is really

00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:48.530
world we're creating we hope is really
 

00:17:48.530 --> 00:17:48.850
world we're creating we hope is really
excited

00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:48.860
excited
 

00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:51.160
excited

I see it this is actually the video I

00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:53.750
I see it this is actually the video I
 

00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:54.789
I see it this is actually the video I
played the beginning is a polymer

00:17:54.789 --> 00:17:54.799
played the beginning is a polymer
 

00:17:54.799 --> 00:17:56.049
played the beginning is a polymer
application it's written by John

00:17:56.049 --> 00:17:56.059
application it's written by John
 

00:17:56.059 --> 00:17:58.150

McCutcheon on the dart team he used the

00:17:58.150 --> 00:17:58.160
McCutcheon on the dart team he used the
 

00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:01.060
McCutcheon on the dart team he used the
polymer dart port and it's pretty cool

00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:01.070
polymer dart port and it's pretty cool
 

00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:03.360
polymer dart port and it's pretty cool
because I absolutely no zero about WebGL

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:03.370
because I absolutely no zero about WebGL
 

00:18:03.370 --> 00:18:06.640
because I absolutely no zero about WebGL
but i do know HTML very well and so he

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:06.650
but i do know HTML very well and so he
 

00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:08.310
but i do know HTML very well and so he
created a bunch of custom elements for

00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:08.320
created a bunch of custom elements for
 

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:10.960
created a bunch of custom elements for
working with you know 3d scene and so

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:10.970
working with you know 3d scene and so
 

00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:12.640
working with you know 3d scene and so
this is just wrapping his WebGL library

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:12.650
this is just wrapping his WebGL library
 

00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:14.289
this is just wrapping his WebGL library
you can see I can change the earth just

00:18:14.289 --> 00:18:14.299
you can see I can change the earth just
 

00:18:14.299 --> 00:18:15.760
you can see I can change the earth just
by changing an attribute on this element

first couple is that we want to make

00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:05.120
first couple is that we want to make
 

00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:06.400

made that clear right now we want things
 

00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:09.640
made that clear right now we want things
to be declarative we think it's very

00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:09.650
to be declarative we think it's very
 

00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:12.480
to be declarative we think it's very
powerful to do that again so instead of

again is to be declarative and write

00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:07.280
again is to be declarative and write
 

00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:10.000
again is to be declarative and write
less code and what I mean by write less

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:10.010
less code and what I mean by write less
 

00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:11.800

would actually write this each and every
 

00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:23.380
would actually write this each and every
time this is the template tag see if I

00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:23.390
time this is the template tag see if I
 

00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:25.630
time this is the template tag see if I
can zoom in just a tad so I have my

template that I'm just creating and then
I call document register so there's a

00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:44.750
I call document register so there's a
 

00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:47.050
I call document register so there's a
lot of stuff going on just to register a

00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:47.060
lot of stuff going on just to register a
 

00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:48.400

other than render some an input so it's
pretty crazy we think we can do better

00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:53.080
pretty crazy we think we can do better
 

00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:55.420
pretty crazy we think we can do better
and so that's where polymer element

00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:55.430
and so that's where polymer element
 

00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:57.160
and so that's where polymer element
comes in what's cool about polymer

00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:57.170
comes in what's cool about polymer
 

00:20:57.170 --> 00:20:58.780
comes in what's cool about polymer
element is that we've created a custom

00:20:58.780 --> 00:20:58.790
element is that we've created a custom
 

00:20:58.790 --> 00:21:00.820
element is that we've created a custom
element that allows you to create custom

00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:00.830
element that allows you to create custom
 

00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:04.420
element that allows you to create custom
elements which is crazy but it's using

00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:04.430
elements which is crazy but it's using
 

00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:06.100
elements which is crazy but it's using
again the document register under the

00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:06.110
again the document register under the
 

00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:08.350
again the document register under the
hood so you declare your polymer element

00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:08.360
hood so you declare your polymer element
 

00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:09.730
hood so you declare your polymer element
you give it the name of the tag you're

00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:09.740
you give it the name of the tag you're
 

00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:11.980
you give it the name of the tag you're
going to create maybe give a constructor

00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:11.990
going to create maybe give a constructor
 

00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:13.720
going to create maybe give a constructor
people want to call you using the new

operator in JavaScript and then inside
 

00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:16.930
operator in JavaScript and then inside
of the polymer element you just drop

00:21:16.930 --> 00:21:16.940
of the polymer element you just drop
 

00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:18.310
of the polymer element you just drop
your markup using the template element

00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:18.320
your markup using the template element
 

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:20.920
your markup using the template element
which is one of those specifications so

00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:20.930
which is one of those specifications so
 

00:21:20.930 --> 00:21:22.150
which is one of those specifications so
this one's pretty simple it just you

00:21:22.150 --> 00:21:22.160
this one's pretty simple it just you
 

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:24.010
this one's pretty simple it just you
know has a style sheet in it that colors

00:21:24.010 --> 00:21:24.020
know has a style sheet in it that colors
 

00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:26.410
know has a style sheet in it that colors
all inputs read within my shadow DOM and

00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:26.420
all inputs read within my shadow DOM and
 

00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:28.270
all inputs read within my shadow DOM and
so its shadow Dom that's polymer is

00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:28.280
so its shadow Dom that's polymer is
 

00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:29.260
so its shadow Dom that's polymer is

data binding week and this is super
 

00:23:31.289 --> 00:23:34.370
data binding week and this is super
super powerful so we had the example of

00:23:34.370 --> 00:23:34.380
super powerful so we had the example of
 

00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:36.200
super powerful so we had the example of

and I have an orange property which is
 

00:23:46.289 --> 00:23:47.990
and I have an orange property which is
defaulted so using a color property

00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:48.000
defaulted so using a color property
 

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.450
defaulted so using a color property
which is defaulted to orange instead I

00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:50.460
which is defaulted to orange instead I
 

00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:51.919

can kill this sort of redundancy here

00:23:51.919 --> 00:23:51.929
can kill this sort of redundancy here
 

00:23:51.929 --> 00:23:54.049
can kill this sort of redundancy here
and replace that hard code those hard

00:23:54.049 --> 00:23:54.059
and replace that hard code those hard
 

00:23:54.059 --> 00:23:55.310
and replace that hard code those hard
coded value is with those properties

00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:55.320

using data binding and using the
 

00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:58.909
using data binding and using the
mustache and so now whenever one of

00:23:58.909 --> 00:23:58.919
mustache and so now whenever one of
 

00:23:58.919 --> 00:24:00.350
mustache and so now whenever one of
those changes it's two-way data bound

00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:00.360
those changes it's two-way data bound
 

00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:02.419
those changes it's two-way data bound
and I can go crazy with this right I can

00:24:02.419 --> 00:24:02.429
and I can go crazy with this right I can
 

00:24:02.429 --> 00:24:04.460
and I can go crazy with this right I can
set up a bunch of markup internal to my

00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:04.470
set up a bunch of markup internal to my
 

00:24:04.470 --> 00:24:06.560
set up a bunch of markup internal to my

its data bound to this polymer local

00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:16.080
its data bound to this polymer local
 

00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:17.720
its data bound to this polymer local
storage value and I'm automatically

00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:17.730
storage value and I'm automatically
 

00:24:17.730 --> 00:24:19.669
storage value and I'm automatically
going to persist data using just data

00:24:19.669 --> 00:24:19.679
going to persist data using just data
 

00:24:19.679 --> 00:24:21.260
going to persist data using just data
binding and internal to my component

00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:21.270
binding and internal to my component
 

00:24:21.270 --> 00:24:26.210
binding and internal to my component
it's very very handy stuff the other

00:24:26.210 --> 00:24:26.220
it's very very handy stuff the other
 

00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:27.529
it's very very handy stuff the other
thing if you remember from the Select

00:24:27.529 --> 00:24:27.539
thing if you remember from the Select
 

00:24:27.539 --> 00:24:28.310
thing if you remember from the Select
case is that

00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:28.320
case is that
 

00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:29.779
case is that
people could you know change the

00:24:29.779 --> 00:24:29.789
people could you know change the
 

00:24:29.789 --> 00:24:31.039
people could you know change the
behavior of the element using attributes

00:24:31.039 --> 00:24:31.049
behavior of the element using attributes
 

00:24:31.049 --> 00:24:34.519
behavior of the element using attributes
and so in order to do that in polymer we

00:24:34.519 --> 00:24:34.529
and so in order to do that in polymer we
 

00:24:34.529 --> 00:24:36.889
and so in order to do that in polymer we
have this attributes attribute where you

00:24:36.889 --> 00:24:36.899
have this attributes attribute where you
 

00:24:36.899 --> 00:24:39.080
have this attributes attribute where you
say I want to publish the type property

00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:39.090
say I want to publish the type property
 

00:24:39.090 --> 00:24:40.399
say I want to publish the type property
and I want to publish the color property

00:24:40.399 --> 00:24:40.409
and I want to publish the color property
 

00:24:40.409 --> 00:24:42.470
and I want to publish the color property
and so then what people can do from the

00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:42.480
and so then what people can do from the
 

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:43.999
and so then what people can do from the
outside world when they use your element

00:24:43.999 --> 00:24:44.009
outside world when they use your element
 

00:24:44.009 --> 00:24:46.730
outside world when they use your element
is for instance change the default of

00:24:46.730 --> 00:24:46.740
is for instance change the default of
 

00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:48.710
is for instance change the default of
that color property using an attribute

00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:48.720
that color property using an attribute
 

00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:50.720
that color property using an attribute
on the tag so they're overriding my

00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:50.730
on the tag so they're overriding my
 

00:24:50.730 --> 00:24:53.090
on the tag so they're overriding my
default of orange here to read and so

00:24:53.090 --> 00:24:53.100
default of orange here to read and so
 

00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:54.259
default of orange here to read and so
that's how you are able to customize

00:24:54.259 --> 00:24:54.269
that's how you are able to customize
 

00:24:54.269 --> 00:24:59.980
that's how you are able to customize
elements by publishing these properties

00:24:59.980 --> 00:24:59.990
 
 

00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:02.060
 
another example of using a stuff in

00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:02.070
another example of using a stuff in
 

00:25:02.070 --> 00:25:03.110
another example of using a stuff in
action is to do something like

00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:03.120
action is to do something like
 

00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:04.759
action is to do something like
responsive design by default I can

00:25:04.759 --> 00:25:04.769
responsive design by default I can
 

00:25:04.769 --> 00:25:07.909
responsive design by default I can
create a responsive layout element that

00:25:07.909 --> 00:25:07.919
create a responsive layout element that
 

00:25:07.919 --> 00:25:10.730
create a responsive layout element that
basically handles all the intricacies of

00:25:10.730 --> 00:25:10.740
basically handles all the intricacies of
 

00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:14.269
basically handles all the intricacies of
dealing with responsive design so in

00:25:14.269 --> 00:25:14.279
dealing with responsive design so in
 

00:25:14.279 --> 00:25:16.580
dealing with responsive design so in
this example I'm using polymer media

00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:16.590
this example I'm using polymer media
 

00:25:16.590 --> 00:25:18.379
this example I'm using polymer media
query element that we've created and

00:25:18.379 --> 00:25:18.389
query element that we've created and
 

00:25:18.389 --> 00:25:20.779
query element that we've created and
basically using data binding to watch

00:25:20.779 --> 00:25:20.789
basically using data binding to watch
 

00:25:20.789 --> 00:25:23.629
basically using data binding to watch
for changes on the media query so when

00:25:23.629 --> 00:25:23.639
for changes on the media query so when
 

00:25:23.639 --> 00:25:25.639
for changes on the media query so when
this meet this query that I've the past

00:25:25.639 --> 00:25:25.649
this meet this query that I've the past
 

00:25:25.649 --> 00:25:29.269
this meet this query that I've the past
has been set this query matches is going

00:25:29.269 --> 00:25:29.279
has been set this query matches is going
 

00:25:29.279 --> 00:25:31.100
has been set this query matches is going
to is going to be true so I'm data

00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:31.110
to is going to be true so I'm data
 

00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:33.710
to is going to be true so I'm data
binding to that and then I can stamp out

00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:33.720
binding to that and then I can stamp out
 

00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:35.899
binding to that and then I can stamp out
a section of declarative markup using

00:25:35.899 --> 00:25:35.909
a section of declarative markup using
 

00:25:35.909 --> 00:25:38.210
a section of declarative markup using
the template tag so if his phone is true

00:25:38.210 --> 00:25:38.220
the template tag so if his phone is true
 

00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:39.860
the template tag so if his phone is true
and that responsive attribute is set I

00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:39.870
and that responsive attribute is set I
 

00:25:39.870 --> 00:25:41.389
and that responsive attribute is set I
can show this section of markup in my

00:25:41.389 --> 00:25:41.399
can show this section of markup in my
 

00:25:41.399 --> 00:25:43.490
can show this section of markup in my
element otherwise if it's false I'm

00:25:43.490 --> 00:25:43.500
element otherwise if it's false I'm
 

00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:45.529
element otherwise if it's false I'm
going to show this section of markup so

00:25:45.529 --> 00:25:45.539
going to show this section of markup so
 

00:25:45.539 --> 00:25:47.149
going to show this section of markup so
now we're sort of using dynamic markup

00:25:47.149 --> 00:25:47.159
now we're sort of using dynamic markup
 

00:25:47.159 --> 00:25:48.499
now we're sort of using dynamic markup
we're using data binding reasoning

00:25:48.499 --> 00:25:48.509
we're using data binding reasoning
 

00:25:48.509 --> 00:25:50.149
we're using data binding reasoning
reusable elements and it's all sort of

00:25:50.149 --> 00:25:50.159
reusable elements and it's all sort of
 

00:25:50.159 --> 00:25:51.860
reusable elements and it's all sort of
just working internal to my web

00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:51.870
just working internal to my web
 

00:25:51.870 --> 00:25:53.869
just working internal to my web
component and people from the outside

00:25:53.869 --> 00:25:53.879
component and people from the outside
 

00:25:53.879 --> 00:25:55.430
component and people from the outside
all they have to do is just declare this

00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:55.440
all they have to do is just declare this
 

00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:57.560
all they have to do is just declare this
sucker on their page responsive layout

00:25:57.560 --> 00:25:57.570
sucker on their page responsive layout
 

00:25:57.570 --> 00:25:59.119
sucker on their page responsive layout
knows what to do with your content it

00:25:59.119 --> 00:25:59.129
knows what to do with your content it
 

00:25:59.129 --> 00:26:00.740
knows what to do with your content it
does the right thing based on the media

00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:00.750
does the right thing based on the media
 

00:26:00.750 --> 00:26:05.889
does the right thing based on the media
queries in it so it's super super handy

00:26:05.889 --> 00:26:05.899
 
 

00:26:05.899 --> 00:26:08.330
 
so polymer is many things right it's a

00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:08.340
so polymer is many things right it's a
 

00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:10.310
so polymer is many things right it's a

declarative stuff so you don't have to

00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:20.070
declarative stuff so you don't have to
 

00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:21.919
declarative stuff so you don't have to
sort of reinvent the wheel and do all

00:26:21.919 --> 00:26:21.929
sort of reinvent the wheel and do all
 

00:26:21.929 --> 00:26:24.259
