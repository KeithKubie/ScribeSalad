00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.720
Ayahuasca is hard to spell.

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:04.800
A-y-a-h... uasca?

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:14.010
Maybe I should go grab some, that might be
easier.

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:16.520
Hey all, Trace here for DNews.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.870
In 2015, the United States got its first legal
ayahuasca church that promised to provide

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:24.300
“ayahuasca spiritual healings” to members...at
a price.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.050
It was quickly shut down a year later, with
skeptics calling the church a cult and a scam.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.640
But… is there an actual benefit to using
ayahuasca, and what is it in the first place?

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.190
Ayahuasca is commonly used by indigenous communities
in healing ceremonies in the Amazon rainforest.

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.050
It’s a tea that produces hallucinatory effects
after consumed.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.730
But many consider it a miracle drug, treating
a number of disorders, including depression.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.190
But is this scientifically accurate or are
we just drinking up some ancient placebo kool-aid?

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.710
Ayahuasca is traditionally made from the leaves
of one shrub (Psychotria viridis) and the

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:55.930
stems of another vine (Diplopterys cabrerana).

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.680
When digested together, they introduce a fairly
famous compound called DMT into the blood,

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.030
which eventually finds its way to the brain
and causes hallucinations.

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:10.670
But DMT has a not so famous partner, harmine,
which in addition to hallucinations, has antidepressant

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:11.670
qualities.

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:12.670
Harmine was first found in ayahuasca in 1996
in the plasma of volunteers who drank it.

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:13.670
According to botanist Dennis McKenna, "Most
people seek ayahuasca with good intentions

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:14.670
- they are not thrill-seeking but are curious,
serious - or have specific issues such as

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:15.670
depression."

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:16.670
There have been studies to back up ayahuasca
as a treatment for depression.

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.670
Most recently, one study published in PeerJ
exposed human neural progenitors — cells

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:25.120
that are capable of becoming neurons — to
harmine, resulting in a 71.5% increase in

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.850
human neural cells.

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.840
This is similar to other antidepressants,
which cause, what’s called, neurogenesis.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.920
But this isn’t the first study of its kind.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:38.270
There have been several studies done on ayahuasca
usually with small a sample size...like really

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:39.270
small.

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.640
But because there aren’t that many in the
overall scientific literature, we thought

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.840
they were worth mentioning.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:49.240
One study with 6 volunteers found improvements
with their mood after drinking ayahuasca within

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.140
hours (typical antidepressants could take
weeks).

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.320
Another study had 3 women with depression
drink ayahuasca, and their symptoms decreased

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.260
for two weeks afterward!

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:02.119
And in a 2015 PLoS One study, they linked
the ayahuasca’s “altered state of consciousness”

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:05.720
to decreased activity in parts of the brain
associated with depression.

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.479
There’s even a meta-analysis of various
studies on ayahuasca and its antidepressive

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.730
effects from the past 25 years.

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.110
They concluded that ayahuasca is a “useful
pharmacological tools for the treatment of...mood

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:18.110
disorders.”

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.330
It’s actually pretty difficult to conduct
studies on ayahuasca...considering DMT is

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:27.590
classified as a Schedule I substance by the
US Drug Enforcement Agency, banning it from

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:28.900
medical use.

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.410
Many of the studies we mentioned here happened
in countries where it’s allowed for religious

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.080
purposes including Brazil and Peru.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.860
In which case, researchers would have to wait
for the perfect series of events: volunteers

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.510
who experience depression and are willing
to drink ayahuasca.

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.270
As for larger controlled studies outside of
religious exception, we may just have to wait

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:47.290
a bit longer.

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.280
As always, more research is needed.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.890
What other psychedelic drugs do scientists
think might have medicinal benefits?

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.622
Find out in this video here with my girl Cristen
Conger.What other science questions do you

00:02:56.622 --> 00:02:57.910
have about stuff like this?

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.230
