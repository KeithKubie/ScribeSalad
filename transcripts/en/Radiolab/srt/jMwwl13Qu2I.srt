00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:30,270
Hey, it's Molly Webster from radio
lab. Before we get into the show today,

8
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:34,920
I wanted to tell you something and that's
it. Radio lab has a newsletter. We do.

9
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:36,960
It's awesome. You should sign up for it.

10
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:39,540
You'd be the first to
know about new episodes.

11
00:00:39,541 --> 00:00:43,410
You'd get updates on old ones
and lots more to sign up. Go to

12
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:46,493
radiolab.org/newsletter see ya.

13
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,810
This is Radiolab.

14
00:00:47,811 --> 00:00:50,870
I'm Jana [inaudible] and I'm Robert
Krulwich and this hour we're talking about

15
00:00:50,871 --> 00:00:54,160
space, sending stuff into space,

16
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:59,150
little messages in bottles or capsules
as it were so that the extraterrestrials

17
00:00:59,151 --> 00:01:01,740
of the future might one day
find if there are really

18
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:03,280
well, yes, yes, yes,

19
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:04,910
but surely there are,

20
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:10,280
I mean someday android space capsule is
bound to run into someone and they'll

21
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:13,790
know about us. Wow. Um,
just the second year,

22
00:01:13,791 --> 00:01:17,150
I know that the Anne story was beautiful
and that you're in some kind of

23
00:01:17,151 --> 00:01:19,460
romantic haze. How did you adjust,

24
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:23,240
get a little more cold-hearted
here about solid facts.

25
00:01:23,241 --> 00:01:26,420
You might feel differently about this
whole thing. What do you mean? Well,

26
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:31,870
what do you think is the likelihood of
Ann's message of love ever being read by

27
00:01:32,751 --> 00:01:35,990
an intelligent alien somewhere?
See where you're going with this?

28
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:38,570
What do you have to ask that
question? I mean it's just a gesture.

29
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,090
It's like a romantic phone.
No, this is an attempt.

30
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,400
I think to be fair to her
had a real conversation.

31
00:01:43,401 --> 00:01:46,040
She wants someone to hear about this,

32
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:51,200
but the chances are so remote. When
you consider the vastness of space,

33
00:01:51,201 --> 00:01:55,040
suppose for example, you wanted
to visit just a make it easy.

34
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,860
The very next star to us. Okay.

35
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,890
Actually it's too lucky
to meet a civilization.

36
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,320
I think it'd be so hard to come out
and flame one in the very first stop.

37
00:02:03,321 --> 00:02:07,670
Let's go four stars out to
a called Zita to calm a B.

38
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:10,490
I see you hang up. I look,
I admit I looked it up.

39
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:15,970
If we increase the speed of the voyager
capsule and drains message from 35,000

40
00:02:16,701 --> 00:02:18,990
miles an hour, that's how fast she
was going, right? Yeah, that's right.

41
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:21,980
Increase that speed to say
a million miles an hour.

42
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:26,000
How long do you think would it take
for you to get to Zeta to county?

43
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,550
300 years. Hmm. 30,000 years.

44
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:32,623
Seriously.

45
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:36,780
Wow. This Jetta, boom. Rod
is a 1200 generation trip.

46
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:41,010
Do you know where the air boom rounds
where 1200 generations ago where they were

47
00:02:41,011 --> 00:02:43,920
living in a cave, beating on a
drum? That's what they were doing.

48
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:48,180
So imagine a space trip in which you
have to go forward. 1200 generations.

49
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:51,780
That's a long trip. You're such a downer.

50
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,560
You think that's tough. Listen to this.

51
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:58,190
There's a whole nother problem
we're going to have to deal with,

52
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:02,830
not the of distance. In this
case, there's a problem of time.

53
00:03:02,831 --> 00:03:06,070
We have one of those two.
Every civilization has an arc.

54
00:03:06,071 --> 00:03:10,450
You can think of it in
threes. Step one, step two

55
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:14,410
Jackson and his Chesterfield.

56
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,173
Bam Ray body.

57
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:21,850
Okay.

58
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:23,320
What the hell is that? Well,

59
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:27,420
a million years ago we
were practically apes.

60
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,920
We'd hardly begun to have
conversations. Now we have technology,

61
00:03:31,921 --> 00:03:34,320
we have radio and TV and
the universe can hear us

62
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:37,960
[inaudible]

63
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,870
but how long will it be,

64
00:03:38,871 --> 00:03:42,560
do you think before either from global
warming or for some kind of war?

65
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:43,843
We're [inaudible]

66
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:45,890
[inaudible]

67
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:48,460
the way the news has been recently days,

68
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:54,110
weeks in case I'm going to guess like
a hundred million years or 10 million

69
00:03:54,111 --> 00:03:57,480
years, but that's still a
flash of time in a universe.

70
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,550
Now suppose instead of one civilization,

71
00:03:59,551 --> 00:04:02,100
let's have two civilizations
and other one out there.

72
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,300
If they arrive on earth
ready to talk and we're old,

73
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,900
then there's no way to have the
conversation. Or on the other hand,

74
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:11,280
if they arrive on earth after

75
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:13,880
[inaudible]

76
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,720
nobody to talk to,

77
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:19,670
and in a 14 billion year universe with
each civilization lasting, you know,

78
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,960
only 10 million years,

79
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:26,230
what are the chances of two civilizations
lining up in perfect synchrony so they

80
00:04:26,841 --> 00:04:31,480
can have a conversation? It's almost
mathematically impossible. Yeah, fine,

81
00:04:31,481 --> 00:04:35,230
fine. But you have to keep something in
mind though. All right, well, as a rule,

82
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:39,790
people who make the argument you're
making right now, pessimists, as it were,

83
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:40,871
as a rule,

84
00:04:40,871 --> 00:04:45,871
those people are usually proven wrong
at say that's always how it goes in mid

85
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:49,420
[inaudible]. Well, I'm in the
history of human navigation.

86
00:04:49,421 --> 00:04:52,990
Lots of things have seemed to lonely
and too far away until someone did.

87
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:56,420
This is the guy who produced the
voyager record. His name is Tim Ferris,

88
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,670
I mean settling Polynesia in canoes,

89
00:04:59,671 --> 00:05:04,630
navigating by the stars and the currents
alone hitting a tiny island after

90
00:05:04,631 --> 00:05:07,930
crossing hundreds or even
thousands of miles of open ocean.

91
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:09,040
That's a pretty lonely,

92
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:11,920
scary thing to do and yet
thousands of Polynesians did it.

93
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:16,390
So I don't know what our
future in interstellar space
flight will be, but it's,

94
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:20,590
it is important to keep in mind that the
record of people who said that this or

95
00:05:20,591 --> 00:05:24,870
that journey of exploration is
impossible or ill-advised historically,

96
00:05:24,871 --> 00:05:27,180
those sorts of predictions
have not fared very well. Yes,

97
00:05:27,181 --> 00:05:30,090
you just hold your horses,
right. I mean, look,

98
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:33,210
Tim is talking about the
Pacific Ocean, which is big,

99
00:05:33,211 --> 00:05:34,450
but I'm talking about them.

100
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:38,480
University of mind is a much,

101
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:42,270
much bigger space in there for a
much, much, much bigger problem.

102
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:47,400
And when I want to ask questions about
space, a yes, I usually go to this guy.

103
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,430
Now I realize why was talking to
here. I hear you through that speaker,

104
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:52,590
but not through my
headphones. Who is this?

105
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:57,920
This is Brian Green professor
of mathematics and Physics
at Columbia University.

106
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:01,580
We are on, okay, so jet, I said to Brian,

107
00:06:01,581 --> 00:06:05,330
if we've got a spacecraft
crawling through this vast,

108
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:08,510
vast empty university,
how long a trip is it for?

109
00:06:08,511 --> 00:06:13,360
Just to start from wherever it is now
to the, to the end of the university.

110
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,000
By the way, what is, where
is the end of the universe?

111
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,060
That's a very natural question. You know,

112
00:06:18,061 --> 00:06:22,140
in most environments you can walk for
a while, but then you hit the end.

113
00:06:22,141 --> 00:06:24,780
You hit the end of the city, the end
of the state, the end of the country.

114
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:30,180
But when it comes to the universe, we
believe that there's probably no edge.

115
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,270
There is no end

116
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:39,130
[inaudible].

117
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:40,360
Now, how do you picture that?

118
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,930
The one possibility is it may be that
the universe just goes on forever.

119
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:46,320
Space may just carry on.

120
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,510
You just keep on going and you'll
just never run out of space.

121
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:54,040
The other possibility is it could be
that you walk off into space for a while

122
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:57,490
and you keep on walking and after a
while you realize that you've actually

123
00:06:57,491 --> 00:06:59,530
circled back to your starting point.

124
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:04,240
Sort of like on the surface of
the earth. You don't find an edge.

125
00:07:04,241 --> 00:07:08,800
You can't fall off the earth surface
because when you walk ultimately you'll

126
00:07:08,801 --> 00:07:10,060
come back to you starting point.

127
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:15,070
That idea may apply to the fabric
of space to the entire cosmos.

128
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:20,690
Although the earth analogy is a little
insufficient cause when I'm walking in

129
00:07:21,001 --> 00:07:22,080
central park,

130
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:26,250
I am on the edge of the earth
because when I look down I see earth,

131
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,120
but when I look up I see none earth.
I see guests around the earth,

132
00:07:30,121 --> 00:07:32,760
so I'm at the edge. Well
as if I were on a balloon,

133
00:07:32,761 --> 00:07:36,570
I'm on the surface of the balloon
looking out at non balloon nests.

134
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:39,950
Yeah. That's where the analogy fails.
If you're on the surface of the earth,

135
00:07:39,951 --> 00:07:44,000
you can jump off, you can jump up.
Yeah. So feels like you're on an edge.

136
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:49,330
But in the universe there is no notion
of jumping off because there is nothing

137
00:07:50,091 --> 00:07:52,370
beyond the space that we inhabit.

138
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:56,480
It is all there is and there
is nothing outside of it.

139
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:04,420
And now to make things even harder for
our little capsule traveling through

140
00:08:04,421 --> 00:08:07,150
space, we now know that space,

141
00:08:07,151 --> 00:08:12,100
that the universe and the space that it
is is expanding, constantly expanding.

142
00:08:12,101 --> 00:08:17,101
So imagine our little craft all alone
in nothingness and every minute there's

143
00:08:17,621 --> 00:08:21,580
more nothingness and more
nothingness and more nothing.

144
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:24,130
And as this always been happening,

145
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:27,650
we think it's been happening
since the very beginning.

146
00:08:27,651 --> 00:08:32,120
So if the big bang was the origin of
the universe and this expansion has been

147
00:08:32,121 --> 00:08:35,480
going on for 13.7 billion years,

148
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:39,230
so there's more space all the time. Yes.

149
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:41,690
Does that mean that it

150
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:46,410
takes a longer time to go from one
part of the universe to another?

151
00:08:46,411 --> 00:08:47,430
Is that absolutely.

152
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:48,773
Absolutely.

153
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:53,580
So when you say something like,
so the universe is expanding,

154
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,040
what that to mean to you

155
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:00,870
is that the empty spaces in the
universe are getting bigger. Yes.

156
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:01,721
So the,

157
00:09:01,721 --> 00:09:06,721
the intuitive but wrong picture would be
that you picture the universe expanding

158
00:09:06,991 --> 00:09:09,420
into a preexisting space.

159
00:09:09,421 --> 00:09:14,421
It preexists existing realm that the
universe is now filling like a balloon,

160
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:18,750
like a balloon filling, say the room
in which you're blowing it up. Yeah.

161
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:22,980
But that imagery is wrong
in the following way.

162
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:26,460
It's not that the universe is
expanding into a preexisting space.

163
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:30,990
It's that as the universe
expands, it creates more space.

164
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:35,130
It creates the new space
that then inhabits.

165
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,990
Whoa, Whoa, whoa.

166
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:42,640
Does that mean that there's no
middle of the universe? Yes.

167
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:47,110
The old idea was that there is
a central point in the universe,

168
00:09:47,111 --> 00:09:50,290
and the old idea was that we were at
that central point in the universe,

169
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:54,490
but in the current way and more modern
way of thinking about the universe,

170
00:09:54,491 --> 00:09:57,580
there is no center. The
Universe is actually expanding,

171
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,990
but it's not expanding from
a certain point in space.

172
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:05,140
All of space is stretching uniformly.

173
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:10,200
Oh mm mm, okay.

174
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,250
Mm.

175
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:14,400
Brian Green is professor of physics
and Mathematics at Columbia University.

176
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,200
This leaves us in a sort
of strange position. Yeah,

177
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:22,310
lonely position in the sense that we
have this little capsule riding somewhere

178
00:10:22,501 --> 00:10:24,630
in a space which just keeps changing.

179
00:10:24,631 --> 00:10:28,050
We don't know where it is or where we
are relative to other things and whatever

180
00:10:28,051 --> 00:10:31,920
we know is changing all the
time. It used to be so different.

181
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,890
Hello, Neil degrasse Tyson,

182
00:10:34,891 --> 00:10:38,910
who runs the Hayden Planetarium in New
York City because once upon a time we

183
00:10:38,911 --> 00:10:40,140
knew where we were always.

184
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:43,200
We thought we knew where we were
and we were the stars. Well,

185
00:10:43,201 --> 00:10:44,290
before [inaudible] Copernicus,

186
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:49,620
the idea of our place in the universe
was largely accepted to be the center.

187
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,600
It looked that way for sure.

188
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:56,470
You stand here on earth and look up and
the sun rises and sets on the moon rises

189
00:10:56,471 --> 00:11:00,160
and sets and the stars rise and set and
the planets rise and set a Copernicus

190
00:11:00,161 --> 00:11:00,994
came around.

191
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:06,340
He put the sun in the middle
of the known universe,

192
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:10,360
allowing the planets to
then go around the sun,

193
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:15,930
relegating earth to the status of a planet
being one of these objects that goes

194
00:11:16,151 --> 00:11:20,770
around the sun. Now, that was a
very dangerous idea at the time.

195
00:11:20,771 --> 00:11:22,420
Apparently, yes,

196
00:11:22,421 --> 00:11:27,421
because that idea conflicted with all
prevailing interpretation of scripture.

197
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,740
It had deep societal ramifications,

198
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:38,050
and Copernicus knew this. He
knew it so well that he said,

199
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:41,170
I'm going to make sure I'm dead
before this hits the best seller list.

200
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:45,940
So he didn't want to publish
during his own lifetime.

201
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:50,740
This book was basically published on his
deathbed as competitive as 16 hundreds

202
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:55,030
oh 1515 oh yeah. 15 three
I think was the pub date.

203
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,370
So now what happens? So,

204
00:11:57,371 --> 00:12:01,570
so now we're no longer humankind is no
longer at the center of things. Now what?

205
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,990
Well, we're no longer at the
center of the then known universe,

206
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:08,920
then known universe was the objects
of the solar system, the planets.

207
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:13,510
But you look up at the night sky beyond
the planets. What do you see? Stars?

208
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,210
They're stars in every direction. In fact,

209
00:12:16,211 --> 00:12:20,410
if you count how many stars are to
your left, how many are to your right,

210
00:12:20,411 --> 00:12:24,400
how many are above and below? It's about
the same in every direction. You look,

211
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:29,380
hey, maybe even if earth is not
the center of the solar system,

212
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:34,300
the solar system is in the center
of the rest of the universe.

213
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:37,720
Yeah, there. Yeah.
That's the ticket. Okay.

214
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:40,810
Now we can dig out of this
hole the Kapernick put us in.

215
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:44,290
Let's go ahead and do that. So
that group is king. No. Yeah.

216
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:49,000
Our little family of planets were in the
center and so that prevail for awhile

217
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:52,690
because it's a comforting
concept, not only for the public,

218
00:12:52,691 --> 00:12:53,950
but for the scientist as well.

219
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:59,710
It wasn't until the 1920s where Harlow
Shapley then head of Harvard College

220
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,550
Observatory noticed globular clusters.

221
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:08,110
Those were more in one direction
of the sky than the other

222
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:14,640
and he deduced that these things ought
to know where the center of the gravity

223
00:13:15,011 --> 00:13:19,000
is rather than these measly handful of
stars that are sitting in front of us

224
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,320
around on the sky.

225
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:25,380
I mean these big fat concentration
of fat hundred thousand star Beehive

226
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:30,520
concentrations of stars, star clusters,

227
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:33,190
they ought to know where
the center of the galaxy is,

228
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,870
even if these single stars don't.

229
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:40,680
And so he deduced that the center of
the galaxy was off in the direction of

230
00:13:40,871 --> 00:13:45,310
Sagittarius on the sky. Okay,
so now people are fighting that.

231
00:13:45,311 --> 00:13:46,150
People fighting that,

232
00:13:46,151 --> 00:13:51,151
but then all hell breaks
loose because 1920s come in.

233
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:56,970
Edwin Hubble grabs the business end of
the biggest telescope of the day and

234
00:13:57,851 --> 00:14:02,851
determines that these fuzzy things among
the stars are not the same distance as

235
00:14:04,151 --> 00:14:07,780
the stars themselves. They're vastly
farther away. In fact, you know,

236
00:14:07,781 --> 00:14:12,781
they kind of look like what
this collection of stars
might look like from afar.

237
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,420
In fact, maybe they are other milky ways.

238
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:18,880
Maybe they are other galaxies.

239
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:23,830
Maybe we're not the
whole story. Oh boy, man.

240
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:27,130
While this guy keeps getting bigger and
bigger and deeper and deeper and bigger

241
00:14:27,131 --> 00:14:31,030
and deeper and bigger and deeper. Yeah.
Oh, this was terrible for the ego.

242
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:35,830
I can tell you I'm disappointed
myself. Oh Man. And so now, okay,

243
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:41,070
maybe we're in the center of the
universe because we look this way.

244
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:44,620
We see about the same number of galaxies
this way is that way, is that way,

245
00:14:44,621 --> 00:14:47,860
is that way it kind of looks like we're
at the center and they're all receding

246
00:14:47,861 --> 00:14:50,980
from us. So Hey, wait the
center then you know, but,

247
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:54,560
but now we're smarter than this. Now we're
saying we're not gonna fall for that.

248
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:57,620
[inaudible] okay, we fallen for
that one nine times already.

249
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:59,240
We're not gonna fall for this again.

250
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,420
Somebody is sitting there in the corner
thinking every time we'll make ourselves

251
00:15:02,421 --> 00:15:04,430
the star of the show,
we're wrong, we're wrong.

252
00:15:04,431 --> 00:15:06,380
So we're not going to
make that mistake again.

253
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:11,410
And so you then apply Einstein's general
theory of relativity and it says if you

254
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:15,800
live in an expanding universe in
this fabric of space and time,

255
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,610
no matter where you are, it will
look like you're at the center.

256
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:25,310
Which means what? There is no center.
Yes. Every center is an illusion. Yes.

257
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:30,170
And so that's how we could look like we're
at the center of the actual universe,

258
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,850
even though we're not,

259
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,870
because everybody sees the same
signature of the expansion.

260
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,980
Now there's an even stronger
argument for then the numerics.

261
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,740
Let's look at the ingredients
of the human body.

262
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:46,700
You learn from biology class where
mostly water, right, but what is water?

263
00:15:46,701 --> 00:15:49,850
Mostly? Hydrogen and hydrogen.
Actually, let's look in the cosmos.

264
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:53,450
The number one ingredient in the cosmos
was hydrogen. Next in the universe,

265
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:58,160
oxygen next on earth and in life.
Oxygen next in the universe.

266
00:15:58,161 --> 00:16:01,310
Carbon next in life. Carbon next
in the universe of nitrogen.

267
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:04,880
Next online nitrogen, one for
one. You go down the list.

268
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:09,290
We are not simply in this
universe. The universe is in us,

269
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:12,950
so we're not the center of the
universe. We're on this side.

270
00:16:12,951 --> 00:16:15,410
Then our gang is not the
center of everything,

271
00:16:15,411 --> 00:16:19,010
but it's just out on a wing and then a
galaxy that we're a part of is one of

272
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:23,790
many and the fact that we are alive is
maybe not unique. I got some, hello,

273
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:28,040
can we go? We can go lower. You're
ready? Do you want to go lower? Okay.

274
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:32,450
We may not even be the
principle stuff of the universe.

275
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,840
That's how insignificant we are. Okay?

276
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,710
We have learned the universe has this
stuff that has gravity but doesn't

277
00:16:39,711 --> 00:16:43,700
otherwise interact with matter
as we know it. It doesn't shine.

278
00:16:43,701 --> 00:16:48,260
It doesn't reflect. It doesn't block.
It's dark. It's called dark matter,

279
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,330
so how

280
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:52,540
travel the universe is the stuff that
we can either see or that is blocked,

281
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:53,500
but we can kind of detect

282
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:54,933
4%

283
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:02,140
[inaudible] glow. I took
you guys, how low can we go?

284
00:17:02,141 --> 00:17:06,550
96% of the university's
missing. 96% universe is not us.

285
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:07,690
It's something else.

286
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:12,520
Is it your working bias that if I came
to you with a new discovery in which we

287
00:17:12,521 --> 00:17:15,190
were less important or discovery,

288
00:17:15,191 --> 00:17:19,030
which proposed that we were more
important that you would guess that my

289
00:17:19,031 --> 00:17:22,780
scientific discovery that said we are
less important is more likely to be right.

290
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:27,930
No doubt about it. That's correct.
Now you call that a bias, but I don't.

291
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:31,410
I call that track record.

292
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:38,430
Okay. Track record we
have among our exhibits.

293
00:17:38,431 --> 00:17:42,900
Here are a timeline of the universe that
begins with the big bang and you walk

294
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:48,290
the equivalent length of 100 yards
and time goes by with every step.

295
00:17:48,481 --> 00:17:52,980
You take million years depending
on how long your legs are.

296
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:56,430
[inaudible] 70 million years
per step, yes, per step.

297
00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:00,870
And you do that for a hundred yards and
you get near the bottom. Uh, it's a,

298
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:02,220
it's a gently sloping ramp.

299
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:07,400
You get to the bottom of the ramp and
then you're reminded that 65 million years

300
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:09,624
ago,

301
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,980
the dinosaurs were roaming the
earth ready to become extinct.

302
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:19,080
And then you take one more step on this
ramp and you reach modern day. Well,

303
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:22,980
at the end of that ramp, we have
mounted a single strand of human hair.

304
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:28,980
The left side of that hair,
cavemen would join cave paintings.

305
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:33,480
The right side of that hair is
this conversation right now.

306
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:39,150
So we are a Spec on a Spec,

307
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:42,240
on a Spec, on a Spec,

308
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:51,440
and the Spec that you just heard talking
was over six feet tall. By the way,

309
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:53,330
is Neil degrasse Tyson,

310
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:56,900
astrophysicist and director of the
Hayden Planetarium in New York City?

311
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:00,290
Is He that? That right there though,

312
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:04,730
is why I think a lot of people don't
like science because any time that anyone

313
00:19:04,731 --> 00:19:07,220
normal wants to say that we are important.

314
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,100
There's some scientists in
the corner who's yelling, man,

315
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:15,890
that's what you spec clients.
His preference, but I don't
know. I think artists,

316
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:19,890
Shakespeare for example, who says
what a piece of work is, man,

317
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:21,350
how noble and reason and all.

318
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:26,000
It seems like it's arched job
to say that we are special,

319
00:19:26,001 --> 00:19:28,700
significant, glorious,

320
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:33,040
and it's science's job to say,
no, we're not. Right. Well,

321
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:37,550
well maybe art is where we should go
next. Stay with us. I'm Jack [inaudible].

322
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:40,520
I'm Robert Krulwich. Radiolab
will continue in a moment.
