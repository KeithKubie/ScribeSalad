00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.210
So I've been thinking about how to introduce this

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:05.790
topic called Classes. In so doing, I went back to

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.690
how it was explained to me in college. I realized,

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:12.170
that those ideas, were filled with jargon, and were really

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.700
confusing. Then, I landed on this thing in Python,

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.850
that can help us draws shapes. Shapes like squares, circle,

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.700
and fractals. And it turns, out that drawing these shapes,

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.390
is one of the easiest ways to learn about classes.

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.280
So let's begin, by drawing some shapes.
