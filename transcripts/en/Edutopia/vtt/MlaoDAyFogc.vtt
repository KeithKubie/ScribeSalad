00:00:09.246 --> 00:00:10.916
&gt;&gt; Ready to answer?

00:00:10.916 --> 00:00:13.686
&gt;&gt; These second graders in
Columbia, South Carolina are

00:00:13.686 --> 00:00:15.796
about to come face-to-face
with a class

00:00:15.796 --> 00:00:18.846
of second graders halfway
around the globe in Jordan.

00:00:18.846 --> 00:00:20.156
&gt;&gt; Good morning, South Carolina.

00:00:20.476 --> 00:00:21.976
&gt;&gt; Good morning, good morning.

00:00:22.076 --> 00:00:24.836
&gt;&gt; This teleconference is just
part of the technology-rich,

00:00:24.956 --> 00:00:28.796
twenty-first century curriculum
mix at Forest Lake Elementary.

00:00:28.796 --> 00:00:31.496
&gt;&gt; We want you to meet
our Principal, Dr. Cannon.

00:00:31.616 --> 00:00:34.456
&gt;&gt; Spearheaded by South
Carolina's elementary principal

00:00:34.456 --> 00:00:36.796
of the year, Kappy Cannon.

00:00:36.796 --> 00:00:38.436
&gt;&gt; Good morning!

00:00:38.436 --> 00:00:39.446
&gt;&gt; Good morning girls and boys.

00:00:39.446 --> 00:00:41.656
&gt;&gt; I don't think there's
a school in the world

00:00:41.656 --> 00:00:43.456
where you have a
regular classroom

00:00:43.456 --> 00:00:45.146
where everyone is
exactly the same.

00:00:45.476 --> 00:00:49.556
Our school is a microcosm of
the world so we work very hard

00:00:49.556 --> 00:00:51.516
to make sure that we
know where children are.

00:00:51.886 --> 00:00:54.596
We don't take time to teach
things that they already know.

00:00:54.826 --> 00:00:57.936
We try to go where they are
and take them as far as we can.

00:00:58.036 --> 00:00:59.646
&gt;&gt; What are you working on?

00:00:59.906 --> 00:01:01.976
&gt;&gt; Oh, I'm working on swamps.

00:01:02.046 --> 00:01:04.046
&gt;&gt; If we all speak the same
language, that we're all

00:01:04.046 --> 00:01:07.886
on the same page, when children
are getting the same messages

00:01:08.006 --> 00:01:11.386
from all of us on what
our expectations are,

00:01:11.526 --> 00:01:14.266
we know that they are going to
have much greater achievement.

00:01:14.486 --> 00:01:16.896
&gt;&gt; Seventy-five percent
of us got that right.

00:01:17.006 --> 00:01:18.746
&gt;&gt; Our focus is on
preparing children

00:01:18.746 --> 00:01:19.906
for the twenty-first century.

00:01:20.386 --> 00:01:23.536
We know that they have to have
science technology, engineering,

00:01:23.536 --> 00:01:25.626
and mathematics to
be successful.

00:01:26.066 --> 00:01:28.736
So we make sure that we
do have a shared vision

00:01:29.336 --> 00:01:31.556
and that shared vision is
something that's always being

00:01:31.556 --> 00:01:33.886
tweaked and changed a
little bit here and there

00:01:33.996 --> 00:01:36.866
as we find our way to
making the best decisions

00:01:37.016 --> 00:01:37.906
on behalf of students.

00:01:37.986 --> 00:01:39.546
&gt;&gt; What's our challenge
this time?

00:01:39.546 --> 00:01:41.146
What are we researching?

00:01:41.396 --> 00:01:41.696
Yes, sir?

00:01:41.876 --> 00:01:44.246
&gt;&gt; Classroom community is
something that's extremely

00:01:44.316 --> 00:01:47.576
important and you can't build
a classroom community the first

00:01:47.576 --> 00:01:50.206
week of school or the
first month of school.

00:01:50.206 --> 00:01:51.696
It is an ongoing process.

00:01:52.266 --> 00:01:54.976
&gt;&gt; Who can tell me what
we can tell by the graphs?

00:01:55.096 --> 00:01:56.656
&gt;&gt; It's also something
developmentally

00:01:56.656 --> 00:01:59.126
that the way it looks in
kindergarten might be different

00:01:59.126 --> 00:02:00.806
than the way it looks
in fifth grade.

00:02:00.806 --> 00:02:02.636
&gt;&gt; So that's what they're
going to be the experts about

00:02:02.636 --> 00:02:03.956
and they're going to
present that to us.

00:02:04.096 --> 00:02:07.796
&gt;&gt; But at the same time building
that culture of excellence

00:02:07.796 --> 00:02:10.506
and having the personalization
with the students.

00:02:11.166 --> 00:02:14.046
You know bottom line is this;
you can have all the tools

00:02:14.046 --> 00:02:16.606
and all the bells and
whistles, all the technology,

00:02:17.696 --> 00:02:19.966
but it's still is going
to boil down to one thing:

00:02:20.036 --> 00:02:22.846
the relationship between
a teacher and the student.

00:02:22.846 --> 00:02:24.706
&gt;&gt; Can you make someone else
feel great this morning?

00:02:24.706 --> 00:02:26.976
Who would you like
to complement?

00:02:27.086 --> 00:02:29.736
&gt;&gt; We have created our
own walk-through form

00:02:29.856 --> 00:02:32.436
which is an observation,
it's not an evaluation.

00:02:32.436 --> 00:02:35.716
And we call that our "failure
is not an option" form.

00:02:35.806 --> 00:02:39.076
And what we did was we tried
to think of all the things

00:02:39.076 --> 00:02:41.536
that we have worked on
in the past few years.

00:02:41.596 --> 00:02:44.526
Maybe we've gone to a workshop,
it might be professional reading

00:02:44.526 --> 00:02:45.316
that we have done,

00:02:45.866 --> 00:02:47.706
conversations, staff
development.

00:02:47.906 --> 00:02:51.266
Collectively put it all together
to make sure that we're doing

00:02:51.266 --> 00:02:52.406
that we say that we're doing

00:02:52.746 --> 00:02:55.446
and to stay focused
and to stay on track.

00:02:55.816 --> 00:02:57.976
&gt;&gt; And you like spending
that time with him?

00:02:58.046 --> 00:03:00.706
&gt;&gt; We also have times
during the years where all

00:03:00.706 --> 00:03:02.726
of the teachers will go
in each other's classroom.

00:03:02.986 --> 00:03:05.996
And again it's a
nonthreatening type of process

00:03:05.996 --> 00:03:09.036
and you can get just that
one snapshot of going

00:03:09.036 --> 00:03:12.156
in someone else's room and
seeing how they have taken some

00:03:12.156 --> 00:03:14.056
of the same information
that you have been given

00:03:14.056 --> 00:03:16.236
and they're using it
in a different way.

00:03:16.596 --> 00:03:18.556
&gt;&gt; You are the best Arabian
knight I've ever seen.

00:03:19.216 --> 00:03:19.736
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:03:19.766 --> 00:03:21.296
&gt;&gt; You're just awesome, awesome.

00:03:21.466 --> 00:03:22.716
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:03:23.126 --> 00:03:25.546
&gt;&gt; If I were to advise
anyone on how to get started

00:03:25.656 --> 00:03:29.886
with training it would be to
find those in your building

00:03:29.936 --> 00:03:32.346
that have a natural
interest in technology

00:03:32.706 --> 00:03:35.546
and invest in those folks.

00:03:35.546 --> 00:03:38.086
And you really have to
be strategic with that

00:03:38.086 --> 00:03:39.366
and it can't be a hit and miss.

00:03:39.486 --> 00:03:41.126
&gt;&gt; Do you want to make
sure that you include that?

00:03:41.216 --> 00:03:41.666
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:03:41.666 --> 00:03:42.136
&gt;&gt; Okay, good.

00:03:42.336 --> 00:03:45.476
&gt;&gt; You need to select teachers
that are master teachers.

00:03:45.586 --> 00:03:47.106
That doesn't mean
veteran teacher.

00:03:47.416 --> 00:03:49.856
It means that it's a teacher
that is well-respected

00:03:49.856 --> 00:03:54.676
by their peers and can ignite
the fire, the excitement

00:03:55.046 --> 00:03:58.036
with other teachers and
then once it begins to grow,

00:03:58.146 --> 00:04:00.176
you know, your job
as a principal is

00:04:00.256 --> 00:04:02.336
to provide what it is
that they're asking

00:04:02.436 --> 00:04:05.836
for because before you know
it you have a school full

00:04:05.836 --> 00:04:06.966
of instructional leaders.

00:04:07.006 --> 00:04:08.156
&gt;&gt; First we place in a light.

00:04:08.666 --> 00:04:11.326
Was this experiencing
a day in the life of?

00:04:12.046 --> 00:04:15.216
&gt;&gt; Anyone who does not hold
a classroom teacher position

00:04:15.216 --> 00:04:17.316
in this building
including myself knows

00:04:17.316 --> 00:04:21.216
that our number one job is to
support the classroom teachers

00:04:21.216 --> 00:04:21.986
in what they're doing.

00:04:21.986 --> 00:04:24.466
&gt;&gt; Who can think of a
question to go with our graph?

00:04:25.076 --> 00:04:27.596
&gt;&gt; Teaching is one of
the most challenging

00:04:27.596 --> 00:04:31.066
and rewarding professions,
and I think it's critical

00:04:31.146 --> 00:04:33.846
that the administration
understands that,

00:04:34.576 --> 00:04:37.676
not just by saying it
but truly understands

00:04:37.676 --> 00:04:39.856
and respects what
they're doing every day.

00:04:39.856 --> 00:04:40.786
&gt;&gt; Great try.

00:04:40.786 --> 00:04:41.356
Let's see.

00:04:41.356 --> 00:04:43.846
Is there anyone who would like
to help Juliana this morning?

00:04:45.116 --> 00:04:47.046
&gt;&gt; For more information
