00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:32.260
NC: Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic-

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.280
?: I'm 3D! I'm 3D! I'm 3D! I'm 3D!

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:37.220
NC: What the hell was that?!

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.600
?: You must excuse him. He's always this way.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.300
NC: Who the flying Ritalin are you?

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.800
?: We are the 3D Brothers.

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.440
He's Distracting. I'm Dignified.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.200
You may have noticed MY work from films like "Hugo" or "How to Train Your Dragon".

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.440
NC: Wait, if you're the 3D Brothers, where's the third one?

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.980
Dignified: Oh, he's over there.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.880
You might recognize him from movies like "Clash of the Titans" or "Last Airbender."

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.920
We call him "Doesn't Count".

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.260
Distracting: Hey, Doesn't Count! Show him YOUR effects!

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.580
Doesn't Count: Oh, um...

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.200
ooh, my hand is slightly in front of my face.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.000
What does it matter? I'm not even supposed to be here!

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.720
Dignified: Oh, now, that's not true.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.080
DC: Yes, it is! Mom thought I'd make things better...

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.900
...but all I did was draw attention to how broken everything really is.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.400
Distracting: Ha-ha! He's always getting involved where he doesn't belong!

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.100
NC: Okay, what has that asshole been in?

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.500
Dignified: Oh, the usual "Three Movies" tripe.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:29.320
NC: Three movies?

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.780
Dignified: Yes. "Jaws 3", "Friday The 13th 3", and...

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:33.720
NC: Don't say it!

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.300
Dignified: "Spy Kids 3".

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.400
NC: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.140
I don't want to do Friday The 13th Part 3.

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:42.540
Distracting: You're doing Spy Kids 3D!

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.860
NC: EVEN WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORSE!

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:57.220
NC (vo): Time to rip in to one of the most awesome, hands-on, coolest directors yet again...

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:58.940
NC: Why do you make me do this to you?!

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.160
NC (vo): ...Robert Rodriguez.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.700
Known for making tons of impressive films on a very small budget, doing a lot of the work himself...

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:11.640
...his focus was to have the creativity of the production disguise how unbelievably cheap it usually was.

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.860
Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't.

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.880
And sometimes, it did both.

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.200
This is the case with the Spy Kids Trilogy (plus one).

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.860
The first film was so enjoyably bizarre, but visually funny,

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.040
that it was easy to overlook some of the more awkward moments.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.220
The sequel is when it started to wear off,

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.960
combining genuinely smart and funny moments, with...

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.500
NC: But, just when you thought there couldn't be more...

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.820
Gerti Giggles: "Camel Poop!"

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.660
He made "Spy Kids 3D: Game Over".

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.740
To its credit, this IS one of the movies that brought 3D back into the limelight as a profitable idea.

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.120
The only problem is that it's used as a more exploitive gimmick than God is to Pure Flix.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.500
Is it bad as, say, thinking Sylvester Stallone can play a hippie?

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.100
Stallone: "You have the children's attention, the question is, what are you teaching them?"

00:02:59.200 --> 00:02:59.700
*whimper*

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.780
NC: ...this is Spy Kids 3D...

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.660
The movie begins telling us to put our glasses on...

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.960
...yes, thank you, because if we saw THIS throughout the majority of the film, we would be helpless to figure out how to stop it.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:16.700
Fegan Floop: Today's feature presentation will also be in three dimensions!

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.200
NC: Alan Cumming is kind enough to interrupt his "Nut Gouging of Your Childhood" Tour

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.680
by letting you know that you only put on your 3D glasses when the characters in the movie put them on...

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.340
...which they wear, not surprisingly, 90% of the movie...

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.920
...so why don't they just make the whole god damn thing in 3D!

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.840
What, did he want to give the people in the theater a little arm exercise? This is entirely pointless!

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.160
Maybe the strategy was to have the people say:

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.260
"Huh, the characters seem flat, and not at all three-dimensional..."

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.040
"Wow!"

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.620
"Now the characters seem flat and not at all three-dimensional...

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:47.720
in 3D!!!"

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.780
He doesn't even call it a movie!

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.620
He probably just Dropboxed it to someone, and was like,

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.920
"Yeah I made this in my garage, call it whatever you want. It's debatable whether or not it's actually a film!"

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.900
Personally, I'm hoping this'll start a new fad in credit-identification.

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.880
Juni: "I was here because I had gotten a call..."

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.860
NC: It opens with the boy Spy Kid, yeah, I'm sure he has a name (Juni),

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.580
But, who are ya kidding, we all just call him the boy Spy Kid,

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.640
having left his agency, and turned into a Gumshoe-
Don't do it-

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:17.620
Ya son of a bitch!

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.340
Juni: "I know why the water from your park is missing."

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:21.540
Girl: "Pray-tell?"

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.340
Juni: "It's winter."

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.100
NC: Man, I though the sequel to Blade Runner would be a little bit more adult than this...

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.820
Actually, the funny thing about this opening is that the weird, stilted acting is, surprisingly, kind of welcomed.

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:37.880
Their attempt at acting out an adult situation is similar to watching the kids from home movies make their films.

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.900
Juni: "They shut down the park during in the winter."

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:42.060
"Who's they?"

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.220
Juni: "The people who really own this park..."

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:46.400
"Alright, cut! Cut.

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:47.300
Guys, that was great.

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.440
Did that feel good? Once we shoot on location this thing is gonna be incredible."

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:53.620
NC: But, to be fair, their acting isn't the most childish...

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.300
Stallone: ...that complete Level 5,

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:00.000
untold riches, toys, and prizes...

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.800
NC: When Stallone is picking a movie, can we just have an old lady in a blue dress

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.780
hit him with an umbrella and shout "Sylvester!"?

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.040
He plays The Toymaker, a man who's been banished to Cyber-Space,

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:13.720
but disguised himself to release a VR Game known as "Game Over".

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:17.160
Which is...kinda like marketing a board game called "You Lost".

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.880
Boy Spy Kid heads back home to feed his small soldiers when...

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.820
...Oh God. Inspector Gadget finally assimilated his niece!

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:25.620
Gerti: The O.S.S could really use you.

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.340
It's good to take care of your family.

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.420
But remember one thing. Everyone's your family.

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.520
Juni: That makes no sense...

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:35.960
NC: THAT makes no sense!?

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.460
You live in a Rescue Rangers Tree House with Budgie the Scary Helicopter,

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:40.860
and THAT makes no sense?!

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:44.780
Why don't you just tell me George Clooney is the president on the United States- What the hell is going on!?!

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:46.260
Juni: Mr. President.

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:51.700
NC: Ok. I'll accept this as some form of reality as long as Clooney still talks to everyone in a patronising tone.

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:57.760
President: The fact is there is no retirement. Once an agent, always an agent. Now it's time for you to be a big boy and re-instate.

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:02.300
NC: Ah. His whole acting career is just saying diplomatically why we all have to clean our rooms.

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:08.540
He tells Boy Spy Kid that Girl Spy Kid (Carmen) is missing, so he travels to his old agency to get some answers.

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:12.200
Apparently, his sister is caught in the mind of Vincent D'Onofrio-I mean the game,

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:14.480
as it seems to be a trap for all children.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:18.900
Prof. Giggles: The inventor of the game. He wants to enslave the world's youth with mind control.

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:22.620
NC: *tsk* Please, I think we've all purchased EA games before.

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.940
So, Boy Spy Kid goes in to see if he can beat the game, save his sister,

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:32.200
and apparently alert NOBODY that this hot selling game is going to take over the minds of the children of the world.

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:34.500
Don't worry, they'll release a patch for it later.

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:38.560
And, if you're wondering what the evil backstory for The Toymaker is...

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.320
...eh, so is the movie.

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:44.580
Ms. Giggles: The Toymaker hates us for imprisoning him in Cyber-Space all these years.

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:45.660
Juni: What made you do that?

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:46.880
Prof. Giggles: Who knows, it was years ago.

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:49.320
NC: We don't keep good records,

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.940
we're not even really sure why we hated Saddam Hussein.

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:53.860
I think it had something to do with his ugly moustache.

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:58.580
Oh look, he put his glasses on. I guess that means you should put YOUR glasses on...

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:04.280
..oh wait. This Blu-Ray doesn't come with any? Well just enjoy this thorough slapping of your eyes for an hour and a half!

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:13.300
He ends up in Hieronymus Bosch's Toontown, where I swear he tries to excuse the lame effects from here on out.

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:15.240
*knocking and boinging*

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.000
Juni: Computer-generated...

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:21.060
NC: Yeah. It's kinda like in "Roger Rabbit", turning to the camera and saying:

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:26.680
"We couldn't get a real rabbit. We just wanted to emphasise how disappointing that is..."

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:31.260
And, of course, the 3D gimmicks start right away.

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:35.840
*random sound effects*

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:38.660
Distracting: Ha-ha! I'm 3D! I'm 3D! I'm 3D!

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:39.700
NC: Get off of me!

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:41.460
Ow!

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:45.580
Dignified: Sorry. Distracting doesn't yet know the responsibilities of his 3D.

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:46.260
NC: Ya think?!

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:50.240
Dignified: You see, I use 3D as a means to transport people into another world,

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:53.140
helping the viewer immerse themselves into the story.

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:54.740
NC: Yeah? Well, what does he do?

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:57.880
Distracting: Well, Y'know that trick when you're a little kid, and you want to annoy someone without touching them?

00:07:58.140 --> 00:07:59.500
Spy Kids 3D!

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:01.140
*random sound effects*

00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:02.800
Does this annoy you? Does this annoy you?

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:03.600
I'm not touching you!

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:05.100
Does this annoy you? Does this annoy you?

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:06.880
I'm not touching you! Hahahahaha!

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:09.220
NC: Why, that's inspired me...

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:10.120
Distracting: Yeah?

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:10.860
NC: Yeah,

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:13.300
to let this bullet touch you instead of my fist!

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:13.860
Distracting: Uh-oh!

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:14.360
*gunshot*

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:16.920
Does this annoy you? *gunshot* Does this annoy you? *gunshot*

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:17.900
I'm not touching you! *gunshot*

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:21.400
So he has to outsmart some terrifying enemies,

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:24.160
who look more like the mascot of several math games,

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:27.440
as he's transported to Mario Maker, where he finds some testers of the game.

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:29.160
?: "How can I offer service?

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:30.940
I'm Rez."

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:32.680
Juni: "Hi Rez, now, about savi-"

00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:35.120
NC: Wait wait wait. Movie, bring that joke to me...

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:37.980
C'mon c'mon c'mon, spit-spot young man...

00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:41.920
"Hi Rez"?

00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:46.420
You really thought you could slip that terrible joke by us because you said it really fast?

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:49.220
GO TO THE CORNER FOR PAINFULLY PUSHED PUNS!

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:55.020
DC: I'm more of an abstract visual gag...

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.360
I just didn't want to move.

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:03.120
NC: So he tells the testers what's going on, but they don't believe him, so they send him to a level on the moon.

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:08.340
Gee, if only there was a way to stop the gameplay, talk to them in real life, and let them know it's all true,

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:10.500
but, unfortunately, they can.

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:17.700
Thankfully though, this game is apparently half "Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?",

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:19.880
Ms. Giggles: "You do get one additional life-line."

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:21.460
Juni: "Call up the family files."

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:24.360
NC: So he brings in his Grandpa, played by Ricardo Montalbán.

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:27.240
Computer: PROS: Superior Intellect. CONS...

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:28.780
NC: KAAAAAHN!!

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:34.600
I don't care, it was totally worth it!

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:37.300
Don't look at me...

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:40.700
Juni: "I choose Grandpa."

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:41.400
Robot: "One Moment..."

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:44.060
NC: So Grandpa welcomes himself to Fantasy Planet...

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:47.920
...not really sure how they flew him into headquarters so fast...

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:50.180
...maybe they just keep him in a storage closet...

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:52.680
and it appears he has a history with The Toymaker.

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:54.580
Grandpa: "The Toymaker is here?"

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:55.400
Juni: "You know him?"

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:59.160
Grandpa: "I've been hunting him down for 30 years, Juni."

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:03.280
NC: I'll chase him around the moons of...

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:07.240
...just...this moon until I give him up!

00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:11.160
To be fair I probably would've liked the ending of "Into Darkness" if it went this route.

00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:12.700
Juni: "You can walk..."

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:20.360
Grandpa: "Oh, I can do more than that!"

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:24.720
NC: The sad thing is, it still looks more realistic than his plastic chest.

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:27.720
But he gets distracted by a butterfly...

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:30.760
...no, really. I guess he likes enforcing ADD stereotypes...

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:35.400
as Boy Spy Kid travels to an arena even lamer than Pokemon Stadium. *booing*

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:39.400
Oh, yes, Pokemon fans, bring me your comments of anger!

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:42.100
They nourish me! Om nom nom nom!

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:49.060
It turns out he has to defeat Aria Stark in Mighty Morphin' "Pacific Rim"gers in order to move on to the next level.

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:57.200
Juni: *screaming*

00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:02.560
NC: I'll give Rodriguez this, these must be the greatest movies to work on if you're a child actor.

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:06.000
"What do I do?" "Just lay down." "What do I do?" "Just move your arms slightly."

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.160
"You're gonna make me look cool, right?"

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:13.200
"Even though you're not moving a single solitary muscle, i'm gonna make you look like the most badass fighter in the world."

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:15.680
Now, Steven Hawking, get in your ninja outfit!

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:21.200
He beats her just in time to see Sylvester Stallone play a wide variety of characters

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:22.360
...because...

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:28.280
...if there's anyone I trust to play a wide variety of characters, it's Sylvester Stallone.

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:31.300
Toymaker: "What I want, what we want...

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:33.160
...what do we want?"

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:36.780
Scientistallone: "(Our)time on this planet is over, it belongs now to our youth."

00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:39.640
Policeman Stallone: "Not if we control their minds!"

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:43.320
Hippie Stallone: "We could, like, start the world over again, and cure it of its diseases."

00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:46.220
NC: Wow.

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:52.000
I haven't seen someone so dedicated to play a wide range of roles, since

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.260
Adam Sandler did a high, squeaky voice next to another  Adam Sandler doing a high, squeaky voice!

00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:02.420
Hell, even STALLONE comments on how he forgets he's talking to himself.

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:03.740
Toymaker: "Who are you people?"

00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:05.040
All: "We are you."

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:08.280
"I forget the extent of my programming powers from time to time,

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:12.460
and, for a moment, I actually believed that you existed."

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:16.400
NC: Yeah. What other ways do you think Stallone fools Stallone?

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:21.800
*random "Stallone-like" grunts*

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:22.860
I AM THE LAW!!!

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:28.220
But they mistake Boy Spy Kid for a magical character just called "The Guy",

00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:30.940
who is supposed to lead them through the final level to win.

00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:34.780
So, they ask him to prove his worth in, yet ANOTHER meaningless detour.

00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:39.340
Welcome to "F-Zero Chance Of Liking This."

00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:45.400
We were gonna go with "Mario Fart", but we felt it would be a repeat of the stellar "Camel Poop" joke in the second one.

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:46.800
"Camel Poop?!"

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:47.640
Still a classic.

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:59.940
Until Captain America: Civil War, these would be the most IMPRESSIVE action effects ever put on screen!

00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:02.520
Maaaybe Foodfight comes a close second.

00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:14.080
Amusingly enough, watching this just makes me I wish I was PLAYING this game instead of watching it as a movie.

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:20.540
So, it's basically every bad video game film, except I DON'T have a good game that goes along with it!

00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:22.920
Toymaker as announcer: "Winner by a hubcap!"

00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:29.560
NC: Never have we seen someone sit, lay down, and slightly wiggle with the world moving around them in such badass glory!

00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:32.480
What am I talking about, THESE ARE the characteristics of a real gamer!

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:35.240
Juni: "I have to go talk to my Grandfather.."

00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:35.760
Rez: "To who?"

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:39.720
Juni: "I mean, I must confer with the wizard of...

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:42.620
...AtariSegaNendo."

00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:46.380
NC: Yeah, young people CLEARLY wouldn't recognise those terms.

00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:49.720
Hey, have you heard of this new invention called "Ice Cream"?

00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:54.060
Juni: "Now they think i'm some important guy who's gonna win the game for them."

00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:57.000
Grandpa: "For our purposes, that's very good.

00:13:57.540 --> 00:14:00.500
They can lead us to Level Four more quickly."

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:05.040
NC: Christ, even when he's trying to sound friendly, he still sounds like he's gonna torpedo someone's ass!

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:11.560
Grandpa: "Oh, Juni. I don't plan on letting him go anywhere."

00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:15.400
NC (Grandpa Impression): "Don't you know the ancient Klingon proverb that says...

00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:17.540
...Camel Poop."

00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:19.880
Juni: "We'll talk about this later."

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:22.560
NC (Grandpa Impression): "Of course, after you tell me where the hell I just went?"

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.300
One to beam up." *beam up noises*

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:45.240
NC: So he convinces them all to work together.

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:48.680
Juni: "If we all work together, we all win."

00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:50.560
Red Kid(Arnold): "With my strength!"

00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:52.460
Blue Kid(Francis): "My Brains."

00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:53.960
Rez: "My Cool."

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:56.540
Gimli: "And my axe."

00:14:57.180 --> 00:15:00.040
NC: They get to Level 3, but it looks like it's Duel of the Fops,

00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:03.540
as 2 of them have to fight, and one of them has to lose in order to move on.

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:06.260
*fighting noises and grunts*

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:12.080
NC: Is that a look of anguish, or does she really have to pee?

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:18.940
I've had to go No. 1 ever since Level 2, and trust me, you don't wanna see that in 3D!

00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:23.420
But she can't hold it in any longer, so she switches spots in order to keep him in the game.

00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:26.880
Hey, it's been a few minutes, time for another creepy speech from Montalbán!

00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:32.120
Grandpa: "You are causing so much pain...

00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:36.200
...and only I can stop you."

00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:46.040
NC: Y'know, I think this whole movie was just a dare by Quentin Tarantino to see if Rodriguez could get Montalbán to be passionately angry at a butterfly.

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:51.160
I bet Tarantino just photoshopped this image and was like "I dare you to make a story behind this!"

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.940
They make it to Level Four, which means Boy Spy Kid meets up with...

00:15:56.380 --> 00:15:58.580
..Spy College Student...

00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:01.980
as The Toymaker lets her help the team to make the game more interesting.

00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:04.140
Yeah, how unrealistic is that!

00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:05.860
Oh, not the villain letting her go,

00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:08.200
I mean male gamers actually following a girl gamer.

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:09.780
Pah! Like they would ever let that happen.

00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:11.700
Juni: "We're going to Lava Mountain."

00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:12.800
Carmen: "We are?"

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:14.080
Francis: "We're following The Guy."

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:16.320
NC: Now this feels more realistic!

00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:20.400
But they're attacked by Uncoloured Happy Meal Toys, and they floor it outta there.

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:23.000
Juni: "Wait, what's worse?"

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.960
NC: Amazing how much it looks like he's running, isn't it?

00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:28.720
Clearly, CGing him was much more practical than...

00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:31.940
...actually having him run?

00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:35.200
Did everybody just film this movie lying on a yoga mat?

00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:41.680
So they swim into the lava and make their way into Mount Doom.

00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:44.160
There, they run into Frodo Baggins, who will vanquish the evil-

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:46.260
HOLY SHIT, I WAS JUST KIDDING!
(Yes, that IS Elijah Wood)

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:49.260
I guess "Ties to the Faculty" formed their own Fellowship.

00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:52.040
The Guy: "If we join together and battle as one..."

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:56.340
NC: He reveals that he is in fact, The Guy, and that he will lead them to victory...

00:16:57.180 --> 00:16:58.760
..only to be killed two seconds later.

00:16:58.880 --> 00:16:59.380
The Guy: "Oops..."

00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:04.000
NC: Dude! He wasn't even around long enough for me to make a 3D Wood joke...

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:07.040
But the girl who died earlier suddenly returns.

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:09.740
Juni: "This is Demitra, my girlf-"

00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:11.060
...my, my friend."

00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:12.420
Demitra: "I'm his girlfriend."

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:18.500
NC: Typical Hollywood romance. You hardly know each other, you mostly fight, and suddenly you declare your love for each other.

00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:21.100
Carmen: "She set you up, Juni."

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:28.600
Well, I'm glad you're right, or else you would've totally decapitated that kid.

00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:29.780
"She's a phony!"

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:33.740
"She..she was programmed to do that..."

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:39.640
But it turns out she still loves him, so she sacrifices her non-existing self to save him.

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:43.340
So it's kinda like when you abandon Yoshi.

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:45.880
You kinda feel bad, but... do you?

00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:51.420
They go back to the real world, but it looks like The Toymaker has been freed, and is stating to take over.

00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:55.320
Toymaker: "To settle the score... for imprisoning me...

00:17:56.180 --> 00:17:59.800
...all I wanted to do was right the wrongs."

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:03.520
NC: Y'know, I think the way he gets half of these people

00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:05.980
is that he just has them Skype their lines.

00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:07.940
Rodriguez: Clooney, can you webcam yourself against a greenscreen?

00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:08.600
Clooney: Yeah, sure.

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:11.440
Rodriguez: Stallone, can you FaceTime yourself in half the costumes from "Staying Alive"?

00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:12.480
Stallone: You got it pal.

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:18.200
Rodriguez: Banderas, can you put on your Halloween costume from last year, and just wave your arms in front of a wall? Any wall, it really doesn't matter.

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:18.720
Banderas: Si, señor.

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:19.720
Rodriguez: Bill Paxton, can you...

00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:21.780
Bill: Somebody ring the Dinkster?

00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:26.320
Rodriguez: Umm... Steve Buscemi, can you just run out in the middle of the streets so I can put you on a giant flying pig?

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:28.660
Steve: Strangely enough, that's not the weirdest thing i've been asked to do.

00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:31.260
I can see why this was called a digital file!

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:34.680
Because all the footage was emailed to him in that format!

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:39.120
Where was I? Oh yeah, giant robot monkeys that you can only see if you put your glasses on.

00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:43.560
That REALLY needs to be much cooler than what I'm seeing here.

00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:46.740
But Montalbán goes inside the robot head of Tim Allen,

00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:51.320
and confronts Stallone, simply to say he forgives him for putting him in a wheelchair years ago.

00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:57.380
This causes Stallone to turn off all the machines, crashing his robot with the two of them still inside into the ground.

00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:03.660
Juni: "Grandpa!"

00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:10.240
NC: Uhmmm....

00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:11.120
...no.

00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:13.680
Just... j..just... no.

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:16.280
101 Dalmatians of no.

00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:19.780
Yeah, let's say Ricardo's here and Stallone's here.

00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:24.080
There's no way. Dead instantly. Their bones would be dice in a Yahtzee cup.

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:26.100
You wouldn't even recognize their remains.

00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:30.920
HOW'D HE EVEN GET THE WHEELCHAIR ON TOP OF THAT THING?!

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:33.840
Let me see if it's any better with this-nope, no. It's still no!

00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:38.760
But that's ok, because everyone learns the true meaning of family.

00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:42.600
And that excuses 100% of everything...

00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:43.760
Grandpa: "To family."

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:45.340
Grandma: "To family."

00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:46.180
Gregorio: "To family."

00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:46.940
Ingrid: "To family."

00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:47.680
Juni: "To family."

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:48.740
Toymaker: "To family."

00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:51.880
NC: To jail. You online terrorists of destruction.

00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:53.860
By God, you're getting the chair!

00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:59.780
Spy Kids 3D is slightly imaginative at times, but mostly just dull.

00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:02.840
The jokes aren't that funny, that acting isn't much fun,

00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:09.680
and so much of the spontaneity of the other films is gone because it's focusing so much on showing off its annoying 3D effects.

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:13.700
I'm glad it got people looking at the possibility of using 3D in films again,

00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:18.100
but good lord, what an annoying film to sit through to realize it.

00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:22.480
And the funny thing is, I actually wouldn't mind playing some of this AS A GAME.

00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:27.900
Rodriguez can be a great film maker, but maybe he also has a secret calling as a game designer too.

00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:32.760
The whole thing feels like a game anyway, wouldn't that have made much more sense.

00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:36.080
Dignified: Well, it's funny that you mentioned that, because that's actually why we're here.

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:42.380
Rodriguez became so obsessed with 3D, that he finally let us completely take over in his new game, "The 3-D Brothers."

00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:44.640
NC: Holy smokes, that sounds perfect!

00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:50.640
Dignified: "Well, what would you like to do today, brothers?"

00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:51.600
DC: "I don't care."

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:52.620
Distracting: "I'm 3D!"

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:57.220
Dignified: "You're right. We should talk about our identities, and what it says about us psychologically."

00:20:58.040 --> 00:20:59.500
"Press Triangle to continue."

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:05.240
DC: "My psychological struggle is obvious. I was a mistake and nobody wanted me."

00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:06.900
Dignified: "Oh, now, don't say that!"

00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:10.100
"Did you know mother once told me she was very proud of you?"

00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:11.520
DC: "Really?"

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:15.640
Dignified: "Oh yes. In fact, the one she confessed to being disappointed in...

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:17.360
is Distracting."

00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:20.000
Distracting: "What?! She was disappointed in me?!"

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.940
Dignified: "Come now, you know this. It's why you hide behind that extravagant demeanor."

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:26.420
Distracting: "Wow, I never actually considered that."

00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:29.060
"Press the Square button to continue!"

00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:33.300
DC: "Maybe we can heal after all, with a hard look deep inside ourselves..."

00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:36.080
Distracting: "Yes, maybe I have more problems than I thought,"

00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:38.180
"And I've just been running away from them..."

00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:41.060
NC: This is a horrible game! But it's actually kind of a good movie.

00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:46.160
Dignified: "Would you like to run away from your problems again, in, perhaps a playable environment full of obstacles?"

00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:49.280
Distracting: "No, I think I'd rather talk about this..."

00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:50.360
Dignified: "Very Good."

00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:53.400
"Now, as I was saying, there are several levels to the hea-"

00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:56.360
NC: I'm the Nostalgia Critic, I remember it so you don't have to.

00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:59.380
DC: "Press X if you want to confront my feelings of inadequacy."

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:04.920

Hey, Doug Walker here, doing the Charity Shoutout,

00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:02.780
This week we're doing a very popular AND very well rated one,

00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:05.860
this is the Breast Cancer Research Foundation.

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:08.360
This is a non-profit organization,

00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:11.900
committed to achieving a prevention and a cure for Breast Cancer.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:20.740
They provide critical funding for cancer research worldwide, to fuel advances in tumour biology, genetics, prevention, treatment, and survivorship.

00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:30.900
This is the highest rated breast cancer organisation in the United States, with an A+ rating from CharityWatch, and 4/4 stars from CharityNavigator.

00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:32.620
That's damn impressive.

00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:36.360
They've raised over half a billion dollars for life-saving research,

00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:43.480
they seek out the brightest minds in science and medicine, and give them the necessary resources to pursue their best ideas,

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:52.640
As a result, researchers are able to make discoveries and design new approaches to address all aspects of breast cancer, and do so in record time.

00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:59.860
Go to their site, or their YouTube channel, to hear all the incredible stories of survival, see how important this foundation is.

00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:07.420
The thousands of women and men suffering from breast cancer depend on us. No institution can conquer this disease on its own.

00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:09.260
But together, we can.
