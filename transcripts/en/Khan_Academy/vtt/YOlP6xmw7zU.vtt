00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:04.510
We're on problem 61.

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:13.930
If 1 kilometer is approximately
0.6 miles, which

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:16.920
of the following best
approximates the number of

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.270
kilometers in 2 miles?

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.120
So we want to know 2 miles.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:25.930
So we could set up a ratio.

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:35.160
We could say, 0.6 miles are to 2
miles as 1 kilometer is to x

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:35.972
kilometers.

00:00:35.972 --> 00:00:37.440
And you could cross multiply.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.960
You could say 0.6
is equal to 2.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.010
And that x is equal to 2 divided
by 0.6, which is the

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.990
same thing as 20 divided by 6.

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:51.010
Right?

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:57.820
20 divided by 6 is
equal to 3 2/6.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:58.560
Right?

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:59.810
3 1/3.

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:04.930
3 1/3 kilometers.

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:06.630
And that makes sense, right?

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.520
A mile is longer than
a kilometer.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.580
So 2 miles is about
3 1/3 kilometers.

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.530
And that's not one of the
choices, but if we wrote this

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.370
as an improper fraction, 3 times
3 is 9, plus 1 is 10.

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:23.010
So that equals 10/3 kilometers,
which is choice A.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:27.850
Let me do a brighter color.

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.490
I don't know if you
can even see this.

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.150
62.

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.290
Lucy invested $10,000 in a
new mutual fund account

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:37.870
exactly 3 years ago.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.700
The value of the account
increased by 10% during the

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:54.080
first year, increased by 5%
during the second year, and

00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:00.290
decreased by 10% during
the third year.

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.450
What is the value of
the account today?

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.400
So you start with $10,000.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.000
When you grow by 10%, that's
the same thing as

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.370
multiplying by 1.1.

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.080
Right?

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.910
It's like 1 plus 0.1
times whatever.

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.780
So that's multiplying by 1.1.

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.430
And then you grow
by another 5%.

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.800
That's like multiplying
by 1.05.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.800
And then when you decrease
by 10%, that's like

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.050
multiplying by 0.9.

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.860
So we need to figure
out what this is.

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.500
So this is a little bit
of math for us to do.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.320
So 1.1 times 10,000.

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:39.550
That's at least fairly
straightforward.

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.920
That's 11,000.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:42.210
Right?

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.270
That's how much we have
after year one.

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:48.930
11,000 and we have to multiply
that times 1.05.

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.660
And then we lose 10%.

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.940
So 11,000 times 1.05.

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.970
Well, just to make sure I get
right, just so I don't make a

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.210
careless mistake, let's
actually do it.

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:06.150
11,000 times 1.05.

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:12.210
So 5 times 11,000 is 55,000.

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:14.240
And then we should
add two 0's.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.210
The 0 doesn't matter,
so we add two 0's.

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:22.676
And then 1 times 11,000
is 11,000.

00:03:22.676 --> 00:03:23.990
You add them up.

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:28.230
You get 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 1, 1.

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.980
And we have two digits behind
the decimal point.

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.700
So we got 11,550.

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.460
Which is right.

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:38.670
It would have been weird
if we got 100,000

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:39.690
or if we got 1,000.

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.780
We only had a 5% change.

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:47.120
So then we have 11,550.

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.320
And now it's going to
decrease by video.

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:50.550
10%.

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:53.020
We could multiply it by 0.9.

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:54.890
I don't know, it might be easier
just to take out 10%.

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:56.140
Well, let's multiply
it by 0.9.

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:02.310
9 times 0 is 0.

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:03.650
9 times 0 is 0.

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.170
9 times 5 is 45.

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.670
9 times 1 is 9, plus 4 is 13.

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.160
9 times 1 is 9, plus 1 is 10.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.899
And we have one digit behind
the decimal point.

00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:18.680
So it's right there.

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:24.640
So we're left with $10,350,
and that is choice A.

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:25.890
Next problem.

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:31.490
63.

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:33.190
And they give us this table.

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.250
They say a computer chip
manufacturer expects the ratio

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.420
of the number of defective chips
to the total number of

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:43.360
chips in all future shipments
to equal the corresponding

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.050
ratio for shipments
as combined, as

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.760
shown in the table.

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.710
What is the expected number
in a shipment.

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.650
OK, so let me write down what
they wrote, so that we see the

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:54.130
same thing.

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:55.380
So shipment.

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:05.500
And they labeled them
S1, S2, S3, and S4.

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:13.750
And they need to ask us the
number of defective chips in

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:14.265
the shipment.

00:05:14.265 --> 00:05:16.610
I know you can't read
my handwriting.

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:21.760
2, 5, 6, and 4.

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:26.430
And then they say the total
number of chips in each

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:38.600
shipment is 5,000, 12,000,
18,000, and 16,000.

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:39.790
Now let's reread the question.

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:41.590
Maybe it'll make a little
bit more sense.

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:43.830
A computer chip manufacturer
expects the ratio of the

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:48.600
number of defective chips to the
total number of chips --

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:54.760
so that's defective to total --
in all future shipments to

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:58.810
equal the corresponding ratio
for shipments S1 through S4

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:02.150
combined, as shown in
the table above.

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.810
Let me make sure I read that.

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:11.010
To equal the corresponding ratio
for shipments S1, S2,

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:14.020
S3, and S4 combined, as shown
in the table above.

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:15.860
What are the expected number
of defective chips in a

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:18.430
shipment of 60,000?

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:21.110
They're saying, essentially,
if we take these shipments

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:23.530
combined, what percentage
were defective?

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:25.620
And that's the same number we
would expect to be defective

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:27.170
in a shipment of 60,000.

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:29.380
So let's figure out what
percentage are defective.

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:31.380
So how many total
were defective?

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:38.350
2 plus 5 is 7, 7 plus 6 is
13, 13 plus 4 is 17.

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:41.320
And how many total chips
did we ship?

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:43.670
17,000.

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:48.410
17 plus 18 is 35.

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:57.940
35 plus 16 is 41, is equal
to 51,000 chips.

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:00.850
So we could view it
a couple of ways.

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:05.100
It's 17 for every 51,000
were defective.

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:08.030
But actually, if you haven't
realized it already, 51 is

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:09.380
divisible by 17.

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:10.750
That's one that a lot
of people miss.

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:12.340
17 times 3.

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:15.750
So then if we divide both of
these numbers by 17, we can

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:23.320
say that 1 chip for every 3,000
is defective, if we take

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:25.650
shipments S1 through
S4 combined.

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:28.140
1 chip in every 3,000.

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:33.390
And so if we have that same
ratio for 60,000 chips, well,

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:36.090
how many groups of 3,000
are there in 60,000?

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:37.673
Well, there are 20
of them, right?

00:07:37.673 --> 00:07:44.330
next We could say 1 in 3,000
is equal to x over 60,000.

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:46.570
And you could eyeball
this to some degree.

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:49.730
Or you could just say, what
can I multiply both the

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:52.030
numerator and the denominator
by to get 60,000.

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:53.855
Well, if I multiply the
numerator and the denominator

00:07:53.855 --> 00:07:57.840
by 20, I get 20/60,000.

00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:58.790
You could cross multiply.

00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:00.720
There's a bunch of ways
you could do this.

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:02.280
But the bottom line is
you would expect

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:04.470
20 defective chips.

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:07.005
And that is choice B.

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:15.690
Problem 64.

00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:18.080
I'll do it in this color.

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:21.640
Let's see, they tell us that A
is equal to a set of numbers.

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:23.020
I don't know what the
context is yet.

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:26.730
2, 3, 4, and 5.

00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:29.430
And they tell us that B is
equal to another set of

00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:38.230
numbers, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.

00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:41.289
2 integers will be randomly
selected from the sets above,

00:08:41.289 --> 00:08:45.800
1 integer from set A and
1 integer from set B.

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:48.130
What is the probability
that the sum of the 2

00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:50.570
integers will equal 9?

00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:59.480
So let's think about all of the
combinations that equal 9.

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:00.730
Right?

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:18.240
If I pick 2 from this, I have
to pick 7 from here, right?

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:21.110
If I pick 3 from this set, I
have to pick 6 from here.

00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:24.005
If I pick 4 from this set, I
have to pick 5 from here.

00:09:24.005 --> 00:09:29.190
And if I pick 5 from this set,
I have to pick 4 from here.

00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:30.140
Right?

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:33.910
So no matter what, I'm going to
pick one of these numbers

00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:35.470
from set 1.

00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:36.790
It's going to be 2,
3, or 4 or 5.

00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:40.450
And depending which of these I
pick, I have to pick the exact

00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:43.080
right number from set B.

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:44.590
So think of it this way.

00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:46.620
I don't know what I've picked
in set A, right?

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:47.070
I don't know.

00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:48.160
Let's say we've picked
one of them.

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:49.770
We don't know which of
these we've picked.

00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:53.200
And we know that exactly one
of these is going to be the

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:54.850
right number to add
to whatever we've

00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:58.160
picked to equal 9.

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:00.180
And we have to pick that
exactly right one.

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:02.950
And we're going to be picking it
out of a selection of 1, 2,

00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:04.910
3, 4, 5 numbers.

00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:09.830
So we have a 1 in 5 chance of
having them add up to 9.

00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:13.965
And 1 in 5 is the same thing
as 0.2, which is choice B.

00:10:13.965 --> 00:10:15.330
I hope that makes sense.

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:17.960
You could say, look, I don't
care what I pick from set 1.

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:20.830
I could pick any of these, and
in order for it to add up to

00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:27.840
9, no matter what I pick from
here, there's a 1/5 chance

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:30.960
that I picked the right
corresponding number that adds

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:31.690
up to 9 there.

00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:34.000
Because each of these
have only one.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.370
If I pick 3, I have
to pick 5, right?

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:42.090
So if I pick 2, I
have to pick 7.

00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:44.693
If I pick 3, I have to pick 5.

00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:55.490
If I pick 3, I have to pick 6.

00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:58.010
If I pick 4, I have to pick 5.

00:10:58.010 --> 00:11:01.870
And if I pick 5, I have
to pick 4, right?

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:04.660
And so you could say, well,
the chances of each

00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:07.450
of these are 1/5.

00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:08.600
Actually I'm not going
to go down that road.

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:12.170
All you have to say is that just
overly complicates it.

00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:13.085
All you have to say is,
look, I'm going

00:11:13.085 --> 00:11:14.130
to pick one of these.

00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:16.930
And once I have one of those
in my hand, there's a 1/5

00:11:16.930 --> 00:11:20.420
chance that I picked the exact
one that adds up to whatever I

00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:21.700
just picked to equal 9.

00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:24.170
And the answer is B.

00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:25.670
And now I'm out of time.

00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:27.310
See you in the
