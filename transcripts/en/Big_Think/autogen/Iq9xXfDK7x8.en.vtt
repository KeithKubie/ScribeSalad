so Daniel you have actually asked a

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270
so Daniel you have actually asked a
 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:07.909
so Daniel you have actually asked a
question that I have never gotten before

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919
question that I have never gotten before
 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.009
question that I have never gotten before
and that is what is the most boring

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019
and that is what is the most boring
 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.259
and that is what is the most boring
thing in space can astronomers agree on

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269
thing in space can astronomers agree on
 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.480
thing in space can astronomers agree on
what the most boring thing is I normally

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490
what the most boring thing is I normally
 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:15.379
what the most boring thing is I normally
get asked about what the most

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389
get asked about what the most
 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:16.939
get asked about what the most
interesting things are in space but I've

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949
interesting things are in space but I've
 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.320
interesting things are in space but I've
never been asked about what the most

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330
never been asked about what the most
 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.480
never been asked about what the most
boring thing is and actually this gives

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490
boring thing is and actually this gives
 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.250
boring thing is and actually this gives
me a chance to talk about how science

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260
me a chance to talk about how science
 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.009
me a chance to talk about how science
works we have a saying in science that

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019
works we have a saying in science that
 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.019
works we have a saying in science that
everybody's data is somebody else's

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029
everybody's data is somebody else's
 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.990
everybody's data is somebody else's
noise and everybody's noise is somebody

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000
noise and everybody's noise is somebody
 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.490
noise and everybody's noise is somebody
else's data let me explain what that

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500
else's data let me explain what that
 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.830

means when you're taking a measurement

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840

saying you want to observe a star that's

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790
saying you want to observe a star that's
 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.090
saying you want to observe a star that's
very far away there's stuff that can get

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100
very far away there's stuff that can get
 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.310
very far away there's stuff that can get
in the way there's a lot of gas and dust

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320
in the way there's a lot of gas and dust
 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.740
in the way there's a lot of gas and dust
in space between you and the star so

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750
in space between you and the star so
 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.180
in space between you and the star so
when you observe the light from the star

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190
when you observe the light from the star
 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.160
when you observe the light from the star
you need to correct out all that crud

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170
you need to correct out all that crud
 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.630
you need to correct out all that crud
that got in the way you don't want to

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640
that got in the way you don't want to
 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.950
that got in the way you don't want to
look at that you want to look at the

everything you do in science there's a

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859
everything you do in science there's a
 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.340
everything you do in science there's a
bit that's inconvenient noisy you want

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350
bit that's inconvenient noisy you want
 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.600
bit that's inconvenient noisy you want
to actually correct it out from your

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610
to actually correct it out from your
 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.820
to actually correct it out from your

that and some of the most amazing

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170
that and some of the most amazing
 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.539
that and some of the most amazing
discoveries in the universe have been

what people assumed were noises things
 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.980
what people assumed were noises things
that had to be corrected things you

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990
that had to be corrected things you
 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.590
that had to be corrected things you
didn't want most spectacularly there's

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600
didn't want most spectacularly there's

they looked on the sky there was noise

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500
they looked on the sky there was noise
 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.590
they looked on the sky there was noise
there was a bit of background noise that

they wanted to correct out they did not

they wanted to correct out they did not
 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.399
they wanted to correct out they did not
want that noise at all and they thought

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409
want that noise at all and they thought
 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:41.810
want that noise at all and they thought
it was a problem with their telescope at

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820
it was a problem with their telescope at
 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.190
it was a problem with their telescope at
first famously

there were pigeons roosting in the

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909
there were pigeons roosting in the
 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.190
there were pigeons roosting in the
telescope and they thought that the

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200
telescope and they thought that the
 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.690

pigeon poop might be generating this

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700
pigeon poop might be generating this
 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.280
pigeon poop might be generating this
noise so they scrubbed out all the

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290
noise so they scrubbed out all the
 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.760
noise so they scrubbed out all the
pigeon poop the no he's never went away

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.889
pigeon poop the no he's never went away
it stayed there every attempt they had

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899
it stayed there every attempt they had
 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.929
it stayed there every attempt they had
to make it go away and all of a sudden

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939
to make it go away and all of a sudden
 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.219
to make it go away and all of a sudden
people realize that what they had

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229
people realize that what they had
 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.399
people realize that what they had
detected what this noise was was a

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409
detected what this noise was was a
 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.010
detected what this noise was was a
signal from the Big Bang itself it was

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020
signal from the Big Bang itself it was
 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.780

actually the farthest observation of the

was from light shining from a distance

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450

so the answer is that there are plenty

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190
so the answer is that there are plenty

interested in plenty of things that get
 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:21.220
interested in plenty of things that get
in the way of my data that I want to

correct out and not know about and there

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540
correct out and not know about and there
 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.059
correct out and not know about and there
are other astronomers who want that
