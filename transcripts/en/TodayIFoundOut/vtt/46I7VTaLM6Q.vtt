00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:09.480
Given that their main and really only purposes
is violently exploding, you might be surprised

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:15.690
to learn that most explosives utilised by
the military are shockingly stable.

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:22.910
So much so, in fact, that, contrary to what
is often depicted in movies and video games,

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:35.240
plastic explosives like C-4 won’t explode
if you shoot them or set them on fire.

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:40.620
In fact, C-4 won’t even explode if you shoot
it while it is currently on fire.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.810
Indeed, beyond the benefit of being able to
shape the explosive in a variety of ways to

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:50.130
accomplish a given destructive goal, one of
the main reasons plastic explosives like C-4

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:56.450
are utilised so extensively by the military
is precisely because they are largely inert

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.510
and can be handled without specialised equipment.

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.470
Further, creating C-4 is noted as being a
relatively simple process that involves mixing

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.360
a plasticizer with a conventional explosive
(in this case usually cyclotrimethylene-trinitramine,

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.500
often referred to as “RDX” or “Royal
Demolition Explosive”- or for the non-Brits

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.760
“Research Department Explosive”).

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.530
While exact ratios vary somewhat, for reference
in its C-4 the U.S. military currently uses

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:29.600
a mixture of 91% RDX, 5.3% of the plasticizer
dioctyl sebacate, 2.1% of the synthetic rubber

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.730
Polyisobutylene, and 1.6% mineral oil or,
for civilian use, motor oil, giving such C4

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.900
its telltale odor of, well, motor oil.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.690
Commonly likened to ordinary modelling clay
in texture and consistency, C-4 and most other

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.990
plastic explosives can be shaped, stored and
molded just as easily.

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:52.150
The key difference being that, unlike modelling
clay, a mere half kilogram of C-4 can turn

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.610
a typical vehicle into a pile of scrap metal.

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.450
The key to making this happen, though, is
attaching some form of blasting cap.

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.300
As the name suggests, these blasting caps
rely on a smaller, controlled explosion which

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:10.940
will in turn cause the explosive components
within the C-4 to go off, resulting in the

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:17.520
C-4 producing a wave of gasses, including
nitrogen and carbon oxides, that rapidly expand

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.770
out at upwards of 18,000 mph.

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:26.470
So fast is this effect that it actually creates
something of a temporary vacuum around the

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:27.850
core blast area.

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:33.150
This results in a second, much less violent,
wave of air collapsing in on the vacuum after

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.550
the initial blast.

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.650
Not keen to just rely on theory, the US Army
has conducted countless sensitivity tests

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:44.080
on C-4 and other plastic explosive compounds,
shooting them with bullets of varying calibres

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.870
and even putting them within feet of things
like hand grenades to see if that explosion

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.220
or subsequent shrapnel could set the C-4 off.

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.930
The Army has even conducted tests to see if
things like fire will cause C-4 to explode,

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.410
all with little effect.

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.459
In fact, it turns out C-4 not only remains
stable while on fire but it actually burns

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:09.680
quite slowly, making it a good fire starter
if you don’t mind the poisonous fumes.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.300
While you might think soldiers would be scared
to use this compound in this way, both because

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.980
of perhaps worrying about an accidental explosion
or from the noxious gasses given off, amazingly,

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:23.300
during the Vietnam war using small chunks
of C-4 as tinder to light campfires, or even

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:27.210
as the sole source of the fire itself, was
indeed a thing many soldiers did, despite

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:31.830
military brass advising against it owing to
the poisonous gasses given off.

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:36.739
Further, beyond its use as an explosive, fire
starter, and badass modeling clay, it turns

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:42.670
out that when eaten in extremely small amounts,
C-4 is known to produce a mild high likened

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.900
to being drunk, something soldiers in Vietnam
also took advantage of.

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.239
It’s probably worth mentioning at this point
that when consumed in anything other than

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:55.770
extremely tiny quantities, C-4 can cause a
host of health problems, as noted in a case

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:59.910
study published in the Journal of the Royal
Society of Medicine in 2002 where a soldier

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.769
decided to swallow about a cubic centimeter
of the substance…

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:06.180
Potential resulting complications of mimicking
this moronic act include “generalized seizures,

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:11.739
lethargy, coma, muscular twitching, hyperreflexia,
myalgias, headaches, vomiting, mild renal

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:15.739
injury and haematuria (blood in your pee)”

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:20.289
Back to the extreme stability of C-4- as they
often do, the show Mythbusters took the idea

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:25.889
of testing this to its logical extreme, shooting
a piece that was currently on fire with a

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:28.139
high-explosive incendiary round.

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:33.169
The C-4 stubbornly refused to explode even
then, despite the incendiary round giving

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:35.210
a nice little blast on impact.

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.419
There is one caveat to all this, however.

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:41.099
It turns out there is a way to set off C-4
by shooting at it.

00:04:41.099 --> 00:04:42.099
How?

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:46.020
While there are a variety of designs for blasting
caps, some may be set off via being hit with

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.659
a bullet, thus providing the needed energy
to cause the C-4 itself to explode.

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:54.089
Why this is an extremely unlikely scenario
in the real world is because these blasting

00:04:54.089 --> 00:04:59.060
caps are typically very small (think a half
used pencil) and anyone trying to shoot at

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:04.029
them would presumably want to be a fair distance
away just in case they were successful.

00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:07.839
This all becomes an even less likely in real
world scenarios given that you don’t put

00:05:07.839 --> 00:05:11.970
the blast cap in the C-4 until you yourself
are preparing to actually make it go boom.

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:15.949
So, in the end, while there are certainly
many unstable explosives that will happily

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:20.000
release their destructive power if you were
to shoot them, it turns out plastic explosives

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.259
and pretty much the majority of explosives
used by militaries and for industrial use

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:30.139
the world over are almost always shockingly
stable precisely because these organizations

00:05:30.139 --> 00:06:55.159
aren’t keen on deploying explosive devices
that might go off unexpectedly.

00:06:55.159 --> 00:06:59.520
Speaking of shooting at explosive devices,
during WWI there are documented instances

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:04.539
of soldiers using shotguns to destroy thrown
hand grenades before they could reach their

00:07:04.539 --> 00:07:05.539
target.

00:07:05.539 --> 00:07:09.789
For example, in Leroy Thompson’s U.S. Combat
Shotguns book, he notes the following account

00:07:09.789 --> 00:07:13.599
where a group of soldiers acted in concert
in this way: “Their first warnings were

00:07:13.599 --> 00:07:16.569
German ‘potato masher’ hand grenades lobbing
through the air.

00:07:16.569 --> 00:07:20.749
Few landed as most of them were exploded in
the air by the experts in the outposts.

00:07:20.749 --> 00:07:24.539
Upon the failure of the grenade attack, the
enemy launched a mortar attack.

00:07:24.539 --> 00:07:28.139
Again the trapshooters proved their worth,
deflecting the slowly arching bombs.

00:07:28.139 --> 00:07:42.039
Finally, a vast grey wave

00:07:42.039 --> 00:07:47.240
of the Kaiser’s best surged forward.”
