(Critic) Hello I'm the Nostalgia Critic I remember it so you don't have to if there's anything Avatar: The Last Airbender has taught us

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.580
Is that there's a yin to every yang.

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:20.820
For every good there is a bad and it's our duty to acknowledge them in order to keep balance

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:27.059
Considering how Avatar is my favorite show of all time it only makes sense in other of this philosophy to go over

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.910
What many you would probably see as a controversial issue.

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:35.519
That of course being the bad episodes of Avatar. For no particular reason, I will now duck

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:38.700
(guns fire)

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.950
Let me go into a little bit more detail

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:42.780
In my opinion

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:50.190
There's really no such thing as a bad episode of Avatar. Even the weakest episodes have something of value in word that goes beyond

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:57.539
What's presented in most family-friendly shows. But, if we want to acknowledge the best it also makes sense to acknowledge the worst

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.170
So we can figure out how to continually make the art grow stronger

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.860
So I see no fault in looking over the not bad

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.949
But just not as good episodes of one of the greatest TV shows of all time (Malcolm) uh, Critic?

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.396
Are you sure that's wise?

00:01:12.396 --> 00:01:16.619
(Critic) Look, we're all adults, and we're going to talk about this in an adult way.

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.560
So what's the problem?

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.560
(Tamara) Just that when people see the word "worst" in the title they might think the wrong thing

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.169
(Critic) Well...

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.199
That's technically what it is isn't it? The worst of the best?

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.430
I'm not afraid of a bunch of fanboys and fangirls, especially for a franchise. I love so much

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.340
(Tamara) Okay

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:32.220
(Malcolm) Shame your life had to end this way *tsking noise*

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.876
(Critic) I'll be fine. Thanks, so without further ado

00:01:35.876 --> 00:01:36.780
*tsking noise continues*

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.202
(Critic)Do you mind? I can hear your *tsk tsk tsk* all the way in here?

00:01:42.202 --> 00:01:43.439
(Malcolm) That's an even bigger shame! *tsking noise*

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:46.860
(Critic) SHUT UP! *tsking stops and then starts again, and then stops*

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:54.359
Like I was saying we're gonna look at the top eleven. Yeah, it is good episodes up an all-around great series

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:59.968
Why top 11 because I like to go one step Beyond so sit [back] and enjoy the top [11]?

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.689
technically worst episodes of avatar the last airbender

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.100
Boiling Rock part 1

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:31.059
In this episode zuka and [Sokka] try to break out the prisoners from their failed invasion by getting capture

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:37.119
themselves and working with sookie to find a way out in all fairness very little is wrong with the premise the

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.530
Development even the kick-ass action scenes that come from it the problem is minor

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.390
But still a noticeable one that being why is there a part one at all?

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:52.630
Seriously this could have been just one episode in fact if it was it could have possibly been the most tightly written

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:58.570
Action-Packed one there ever was but instead we get time dedicated to planning an escape from the prison

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.929
Putting that plan to motion and ultimately having a fail

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:08.590
Which of course leads to the second planning of the escape from the prison and a second attempt to put it into motion?

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:09.820
that one succeeds

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.270
but well

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:15.130
Why the hell did they just edit the first one out then were they just?

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.320
Short an episode so they decided to stretch one out a little more don't get me wrong. There's a lot of character

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:26.290
There's a lot development it furthers the story, but I think all that probably could have been fit into one [episode]

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:31.089
Maybe with just a tiny cut here there. I guess in [some] respects. It's a bit more realistic

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:37.360
Not to have the first attempt succeed, but it's also realistic that appa would most likely eat momo at some point

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:42.279
But that doesn't mean to want to see it when the episode finally does get going with the real plan in part [two]

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.120
It's great. It's a lot of fun

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:50.260
It's just [seeing] through part one that isn't bad, but it isn't necessary either probably a nitpick

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:56.469
But like I said this is the worst of the best, so you'll probably see a couple more you happy now. I'm never happy

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.180
number 10

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:04.099
the Serpent's Pass

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:08.048
Team Avatar has to pass through a dangerous route to get to the city of Ba sing se

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:14.649
after agreeing to take a pregnant couple with them and being reunited with sookie the team tried their best not to get gobbled up by

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:21.190
A giant beast while also [working] out their emotional problems again, not a bad premise, but the emotional problems

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:26.499
They're working through just artists engaging compared to other episodes for example Sokka gets

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:31.899
Overprotective sookie because he has lost a loved one before, but we know how it's Gonna end [right]?

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:35.500
He's is up as she convinces him that she can take care of herself

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:42.100
Just by getting captured later, but come on. That's like setting a bowling pins egg is still dealing with the loss of appa

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.459
But we've got a lot of [that] a much more intense episode prior

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:50.979
So again it [just] kind of feels like leftovers heck even zuko's problem seems pretty mundane

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.789
Just trying to get more food with Jets Gang and a [ferry] um

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:56.660
[on] [Earth]

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:02.949
Not that these are bad problems to focus on but when you combine them all together and also throw in a mother giving birth

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.719
Just kind of a slow one even the serpent compared to all the other great designs

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.329
They've had on the show is not especially that memorable

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:15.340
[I] mean, what was the combination of animals on that one the dragon from [Zelda] 2 with a novelty map?

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:21.039
[I] know means awful, but even as the slower episodes go this one. Just felt really stuck

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:25.598
I guess if that was the intention of the episode it definitely worked nothing major

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:31.930
not

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:33.880
Jet

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:38.040
fresh off the last episode jet has a great morale with a great payoff but

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:43.709
Kind of the less than thrilling character to do it with [jet] on the surface seems interesting enough

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:47.190
He's like a young robin hood trying to teach the fire nation a lesson

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:53.100
But goes too far when he tries to take out innocent civilians this creates some interesting baggage for the character

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:56.550
But for the most part he's just kind of a good-looking thief

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:03.119
He's there to throw another wrench into aang and Katara's romance and mostly just be a good look Boyle [is] nothing

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:10.320
He has no character. It's just not very much again by avatar standards. It's not that he's annoying or unpleasant

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:16.320
It's just we've seen the good-looking hero, who it turns out is [not] the hero and has a stubborn side

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:21.869
That's just never going to change most of us know it's coming and we're just kind of waiting [for] it to take its course

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:26.939
While the more allah teaches about innocence caught in the crossfire of war is certainly a strong one

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.220
[I] do wish there was a slightly better character to get across with if he was even more memorable

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:38.190
Maybe this could have been an even bigger deal the kid equivalent of Magneto or something as is he's not bad

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:41.969
But [like] the episode proved he's certainly not everything he was built up to be

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:44.550
Doesn't seem fair does it

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:48.960
number

00:06:49.949 --> 00:06:57.679
Cave of two lovers the romance on avatar has always been one of the weaker points and lee's praying in guitar anyway

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:03.289
It's not that I can't see them together. It's that we have to go through a lot of the same cliches

00:07:03.289 --> 00:07:08.809
We've gotten in other romances where they'll always be overly awkward which leads to a misunderstanding

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:14.570
Which leads to them being angry at each other and of course leads to them both realizing they were wrong

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:18.380
Say directed by Gary Marshall, and we got a [wrap] in this episode

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:22.669
We go through most of that in a setting [called] the cave of two lovers on the one hand

00:07:22.669 --> 00:07:27.529
I'm kind of glad all the romantic comedy cliches were kind of gotten out in this one episode

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:30.619
but still I don't think you needed them to begin [with]

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:36.049
Falling in love is interesting enough without having to feel you always have to throw in this constant bickering

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:41.419
This continuing formula of the couple that argues all the time, but that somehow gets together in the end

00:07:41.419 --> 00:07:47.448
I mean, why does there have to be so much bickering in so many romances don't they know that's what marriage is for

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:49.740
You know they're going to get together

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:55.070
So I never got why they tried to drag it out as long as [they] did they can get together early on

00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:59.179
There's nothing wrong with it. [have] them be a couple afterwards work through a relationship stuff

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:03.859
That would happen after you decide to be a couple come on. There's other areas to go in this and granted

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:05.520
It's not office bad

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:09.949
But it has those romantic comedy trademarks that avatar just seems to be above

00:08:10.169 --> 00:08:12.469
But still when a nice scene does play out

00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:18.979
It does seem legitimately nice, and we do see Sokka deal with this world's interpretation of well hippies

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:25.579
so is by no means a loss, but I think this couple can definitely be strong enough without the Julia Roberts tropes and

00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:29.329
God help you if you actually make guitar laughs that way

00:08:33.599 --> 00:08:35.599
number seven

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:38.840
the Waterbending Master

00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:40.970
After making their way to the Northern water tribe

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:45.109
Guitar is horrified to discover that they don't teach women and girls how to fight

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:51.260
But only how to heal so she faces off with the prejudice of Aang's new Master to show sisters are doing it for themselves

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:58.340
I never know how to feel about episodes like this [on] the one hand. Yeah. There's always going to be people or cultures

00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:02.059
We're gonna be prejudiced about anything Gender [Ray's] appearance

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:02.520
whatever

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:04.999
So it makes sense to stand up against that

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:12.200
On the other hand isn't the message done better if instead of preaching about what you want to see you just show it

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:16.790
Growing up as a little boy. I always loved gosselin from [Darkwing] [duck] and babs from tiny toons

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:20.179
[I] didn't care [that] they were girls, and that's because the show didn't care either

00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:22.790
They were just funny characters that were part of the group

00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:28.759
So I never had any problem with them however when the troupe of girls proving they can do what boys can do comes in?

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:31.190
Always feel like it's making the character more

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:38.840
Statistic than a person and guitar is definitely not that neither her gender nor any prejudice against her was her identity

00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:45.200
So this plotline didn't seem especially needed as a kid if the people in the world you love accept something

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:49.759
It's more likely you're gonna accept it too, but again on the [other] hand

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:55.910
We do know all this bullshit does happen in the world, and there's always going to be idiot douchebags out there who enforce it

00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:58.790
So it's probably good to be prepared [for] it, right

00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:02.479
It's hard to say what the best route to take is but with this episode

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:05.569
We all know exactly what that route is going to be

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:09.619
She's going to win him over and of course he's going to teach her in the end

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:16.160
Even if you are gonna take this road, isn't there a slightly different way you could do it some variations something

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:17.820
We didn't see coming [no]

00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:22.280
We did get some great water bending action great shots of the city and hey

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:25.309
It's still these great characters being great characters

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:31.160
I guess all I'm looking [for] is a little bit more variety in the message or at least the teaching of the message

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:36.830
But again, I still got to see Katara. Do what Katara does and is pretty awesome, so I can't complain too hard

00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:38.830
You can knock me down

00:10:42.459 --> 00:10:44.459
number [six]

00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:46.990
Sokka's Master

00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:51.000
This actually ties into the same argument. I had with the last one only this time

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:56.729
It's a bit of a different prejudice [Sokka] feels bad because he's not a bender like anka Taro or [toth]

00:10:57.130 --> 00:11:04.650
Because of this he feels totally useless so he finds a master to teach him the art of sword fighting and being a great fighter

00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:08.190
He even manages to put a sword made from a meteorite together

00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:12.900
So now he never has to feel left out ever again the strange thing about this episode

00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:18.569
Is that through the previous seasons they've tried to convince us Sokka had a point and in my opinion

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:22.409
They succeeded Sokka was more than just the comic relief

00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:26.490
He was the idea guy the one who thought out of the box [the] one who at times

00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:28.050
Could be a little too nutty

00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:34.500
But always came through with what he needed to come through with he even already had a weapon his trusty boomerang and we all

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:38.820
Associated it with him. So the idea of acting like he had no pardon everything

00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:40.820
I was going on didn't seem necessary

00:11:41.050 --> 00:11:44.550
He was important not just for last before strategic planning

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:51.539
and he was good at it right even so this whole episode about him trying to feel redeemed and valuable didn't really pay off because

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:54.210
We already thought he was again

00:11:54.210 --> 00:12:01.319
It's drawing attention to a prejudice you probably weren't prejudiced against and possibly didn't even know was a thing Sokka's fine

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:02.620
[no] improvements needed

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:08.460
It's almost like the [creator's] were anticipating a backlash for [him] that as far as I know never came

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:15.030
Who can't love Sokka Suckas great never change for anyone big guy keep it real water tribe?

00:12:22.269 --> 00:12:24.269
number five

00:12:25.389 --> 00:12:29.369
The Swamp [a] lot of things are hinted at in this episode

00:12:29.370 --> 00:12:32.039
But many of them don't turn out coming very far

00:12:32.079 --> 00:12:36.568
The team is lost in a swamp that gives visions of the past present and even future

00:12:36.819 --> 00:12:43.169
While trying to figure out what it means they're also trying to outrun a couple of swamp rats who want to eat their animal companions?

00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:47.819
For dinner the ending is definitely interesting as it delivers a message about how all things are connected

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:54.569
[and] to its credit in a very creative [way], but there's one major problem. You're in the swamp a

00:12:55.389 --> 00:13:02.549
Disgusting dark bug filled gloomy ass swamp who the hell wants to be in a swamp there isn't any fun

00:13:02.889 --> 00:13:07.438
Goodness being like a nice forest or a creepy forest or an I don't know which is anything

00:13:07.439 --> 00:13:11.639
But a swamp do we really have to focus on this world's version of Duck dynasty

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:13.680
[I] think we can survive without that

00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:19.500
We also get the return of zuko as the blue spirit as well as haunting memories from Katara and Sokka's past

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:26.130
But none of them seemed to especially go far in the long run the only thing that really plays a big [part] is aang seeing

00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:28.979
A vision of toph who would eventually become his earthbending teacher

00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:33.930
But aside from that rich is stuck in this nasty-ass swamp and don't get me wrong

00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:35.910
I know a lot of his don't judge a book by

00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:41.339
It's cover and honestly they did get a lot more wisdom entertainment than I would have thought they would [have] in this environment

00:13:41.339 --> 00:13:45.059
But yeah the avatar version of deliverance not a fan

00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:52.080
the painted Lady

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:57.180
[I] think we all kind of cringe when we hear an episode of anything is going to be about the

00:13:57.310 --> 00:14:03.480
Environment and yes, the environment is important save the Earth all that good stuff, but let's face it guys

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:05.340
[it's] so rarely done

00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:12.209
Well truth be told there's only two family related shows I can think of that handle it with any subtlety or intelligence

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:17.340
Sonic the Hedgehog a knife in choking there actually is a subtle environment message in there much better [than]

00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:19.890
That's our show

00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:26.850
And of course avatar the whole show definitely has a strong tie to Nature health the nations are named after the four

00:14:27.250 --> 00:14:33.540
Elements, but it was never rubbed to much in your face that is with the exception of this well

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:36.329
No way is bad as other environmental messages

00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:38.939
Why did the Show feel they needed one?

00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:45.390
Addressing pollution and saving the Earth the show's already kind of been doing that with its subtlety hasn't it

00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:52.229
Katara is concerned because while they're not supposed to interfere with the fire nation yet a village is starving and losing their home to pollution

00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:58.529
So she disguises herself as the spirit of the river known as the painted lady to feed and heal all those who need it

00:14:58.630 --> 00:15:03.450
It brings up a good debate on how far does one go before interfering with other cultures

00:15:03.450 --> 00:15:06.780
But like many of you when you see a big bad

00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:12.840
Factory Spewing sludge and young kids who control the elements try to help I only think of one thing

00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:22.180
again as most

00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:29.099
Environmental episodes of [family] shows go this one is not honestly that bad, but compared to what the rest of the show had been

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:35.640
Naturally giving us all this time this one's just a hint too obvious you wouldn't mind keeping that a secret by the way would you?

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:37.920
No problem

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:40.800
number three

00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:45.280
The Headband now. I'm just gonna Say it avatar

00:15:46.970 --> 00:15:48.230
Really?

00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:55.960
Really of all the movies for avatar [-] Joyfully rip-off we get a bizarre version of footloose

00:15:56.870 --> 00:16:01.929
[yeah], what loose hanging the Gang had to sneak through the fire nation dressed as civilians?

00:16:01.930 --> 00:16:06.310
But aang gets picked up by [a] school and sure enough. He's now getting an education

00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:11.229
The only downside is the kids aren't allowed to have fun what to do

00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:17.590
Blow a party inviting all the kids and show them it's okay to enjoy yourself be silly and of course

00:16:17.930 --> 00:16:23.950
Even dance [a] part of me really [laughs] that [this] episode even exists. I mean Lord

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:31.210
Avatar does what loose it's just so strange that you know the creators of this just had to do it

00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:38.229
But dude this is the second [episode] of the last season and the last one was [pretty] heavy

00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:42.099
This is [the] follow-up work in it. I mean. Yeah, okay

00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:48.400
Maybe you need something light after so much drama, but this is really light and really

00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:53.739
[freakin] corny yeah betar has had a lot of corny moments

00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:59.140
But this is throwing a prom in [the] heartland of your enemy. I don't know. It's just a little

00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:01.160
Really?

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:02.180
footloose!?

00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:07.479
Kevin bacon [they] [did] the Footloose on top of doing the obvious follow your dreams message

00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:12.550
It does give us a nice chance to see again that not all the fire nation is made up of evil

00:17:12.550 --> 00:17:18.279
Foot soldiers. There are normal people with normal kids and unlike the ones before we get a little

00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:22.030
[bit] of that gentleness rather than just see it. It's cute

00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:22.990
It's innocent,

00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:25.209
but if I told someone, this was my

00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:33.159
Favorite all-time show and this was the episode they saw they'd think there was fucking mental if you like seeing avatar do footloose that fine

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:35.680
It's not like I can't see why it's just

00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:39.700
Footloose!?

00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:50.580
Bato of the water tribe when I first saw this it was my least favorite

00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:52.912
episode, why, because I felt it

00:17:52.912 --> 00:17:55.500
went against everything that [Aang] was.

00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:59.340
Our team comes across an old friend from the water tribe named Bato.

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:05.680
As Bato recommends them to look for their father and finds a letter from exactly him Sokka and Katara's Dad.

00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:08.060
Afraid Sokka and Katara will leave him

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:12.940
He actually hides the letter destroying the possibility of them being reunited

00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:15.579
I couldn't believe it when I saw this episode

00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:23.079
This is a Aang, friggin Aang who destroyed this opportunity for his two best friends whom he owes everything to.

00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:28.120
for seeing what's left of their family, it just it didn't feel like him

00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:28.810
I know

00:18:28.810 --> 00:18:35.649
He's a kid and kids make emotional mistakes, but they've established him as being smart and sensitive he, grows up an environment

00:18:35.650 --> 00:18:36.700
[that] is nothing

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:42.910
But this with everything that Aang's characters seemed in what he was taught this just didn't seem [like] him

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:49.239
It seemed downright Alien even Sokka and Katara's seemed a little harsher than usual, but to be fair

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:52.240
It's kind of hard to blame them. This was a pretty big deal

00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:56.949
Now with that said there are [a] lot of good elements looking back on again

00:18:57.470 --> 00:19:01.030
We got to meet Jun the [Bounty] [hunter] there was still some awesome fighting

00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:05.499
And it does I guess cement them as a family unit. It's the only time though

00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:08.739
I've ever seen this character not feel like the character

00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:14.980
Which I suppose is good seeing how lots of shows make that mistake often and this one only [slips] up [once]

00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:20.440
Some good fighting and still an overall good message, but man, I will never get that choice

00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:30.679
And the number one worst episode of oh you [timmy]. You know it's the great divide

00:19:33.030 --> 00:19:40.009
Yep, the universally hated episode by practically every avatar fan. It doesn't connect much to the grand story

00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:45.589
It doesn't further much character, and it's considered by many to be a complete waste of time

00:19:46.049 --> 00:19:48.619
[so] is it really as bad [as] all that?

00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:49.770
well

00:19:49.770 --> 00:19:55.249
let's take a look at the set up two feuding tribes find they have to cross through a canyon called the great divide and

00:19:55.350 --> 00:20:01.100
Ain´t decides to help them through it [trying] constantly to be the peacekeeper all the tribe can do is bicker

00:20:01.289 --> 00:20:04.609
Complain shout yell and blame each other for everything

00:20:04.679 --> 00:20:12.168
And I hope you're a fan of that because that is literally what takes up the majority of the episode after listening to oh?

00:20:12.169 --> 00:20:15.469
I don't know twenty four minutes of this egg finally lets them know that

00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:17.480
They're feuding was all based on a bogus

00:20:17.549 --> 00:20:22.908
History that this great big warring few was actually based on two little kids fighting over a ball

00:20:23.010 --> 00:20:26.179
That's actually a pretty funny idea the tribes decide

00:20:26.179 --> 00:20:31.609
There's no reason to hate each other and that the honor they were fighting for [can] be reached if they all decide to forgive

00:20:31.799 --> 00:20:34.759
The Catch Aang is a fucking liar

00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:40.220
You could call it lying what I need the whole thing off. You did not

00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:45.860
That is so wrong now. Where's that custard tart and good Lord remember?

00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:49.159
How we talked about breaking character in the last one we're on the peaceful?

00:20:49.590 --> 00:20:53.390
Airbending philosophy of Balance and truths as I say just make shit up

00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:59.689
If you can't find the best route just lie about it. No harm done. So not only do you have an episode

00:20:59.690 --> 00:21:03.049
That's mostly complaining and arguing even among the main characters

00:21:03.049 --> 00:21:10.249
But you also have would have been a clever message about prejudice reduced down to if someone's a racist lie your ass off

00:21:10.409 --> 00:21:14.659
These we could have had something if angus stopped talking and the two

00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:21.709
Separated but straight up making up a story explaining years of real hurt. This is a weird message

00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:22.980
They're trying to Convey

00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:25.730
I'm not even sure what you're supposed to take out of it

00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:31.640
Sometimes lying is good [the] needs of the short-term solution Outweigh the needs of the long-term solution

00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:34.789
The truth will set you free only when it's convenient

00:21:34.950 --> 00:21:41.059
This episode was so hated that even in the series recap. They act out the scene pretending like it never happened

00:21:41.609 --> 00:21:46.909
Look, it's the great divide the biggest canyon in the Earth Kingdom

00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:56.659
[let's] keep flying. It's clunky. It's misguided. [it's] confused much like the great divide. It's a great mess

00:21:58.080 --> 00:21:59.909
Let's keep flying

00:21:59.909 --> 00:22:01.139
but

00:22:01.139 --> 00:22:05.179
Even with that said I still don't think it's a bad episode

00:22:06.149 --> 00:22:11.899
Because I still stand by [that] there are no bad episodes even that. It's weak as avatar was

00:22:12.450 --> 00:22:17.569
Fantastic because no matter what it always had great characters great story great

00:22:17.789 --> 00:22:20.598
animation and the ability to take children and adult

00:22:21.149 --> 00:22:25.819
100% seriously it's a show unlike any other we've ever seen yes

00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:30.169
There's a lot of things that aren't good and the great divide, but the animation is still great

00:22:30.379 --> 00:22:36.079
I still like following these characters. I still like hearing their performance. I still want to see where the story is Gonna

00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:40.939
Go, that's the incredible hole that the show has even when it's not great

00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:45.499
There's still great things in it, and that's why avatar will always be one of a kind

00:22:48.549 --> 00:22:49.249
I

00:22:49.249 --> 00:22:56.679
Am seeing this is all about keeping the grand balance it only makes sense next week to do the top 11 greatest avatar episodes

00:22:58.580 --> 00:23:00.580
There will they call me the fuck down

00:23:00.999 --> 00:23:04.629
I don't know critic. There's still two minutes left in the time-barred

00:23:05.149 --> 00:23:11.738
Something could still go wrong. [yeah]. Yeah like there's somebody out there who could possibly do something bad [to] you oh

00:23:11.749 --> 00:23:12.249
Yeah

00:23:12.249 --> 00:23:15.728
What are people gonna do complain on message boards [right] mean?

00:23:16.039 --> 00:23:21.608
Comments, show me one person who would actually be crazy enough to cause me physical harm because of this list

00:23:34.149 --> 00:23:37.079
Sir, I just received word from the [avatar] [fanbase]

00:23:37.090 --> 00:23:43.109
They say the Nostalgia Critic has disgraced the franchise by doing a top 11 worst episodes list how do you wish to respond?

00:23:46.210 --> 00:23:51.149
Tell them I'll be arriving in one week's time. I look forward to winning back the fanbase

00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:55.080
Yes, sir. Okay. Let's go
