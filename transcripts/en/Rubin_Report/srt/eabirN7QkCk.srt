1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,110
[inaudible]

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:06,510
joining me today as a gorilla journalist,

3
00:00:06,511 --> 00:00:11,110
the head of Project Veritas and the
author of American Prob de James O'keefe.

4
00:00:11,111 --> 00:00:12,640
Welcome to the Rubin report.
Great to be here.

5
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:17,860
Long overdue I think is the way I'm going
to start this one because you are sort

6
00:00:17,861 --> 00:00:21,490
of right in the center of a lot of the
things that I'm constantly talking about.

7
00:00:21,491 --> 00:00:24,740
So it's good to have you. Great to be
here. Thanks for having me. Okay, so, uh,

8
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:27,880
before we get into all your work that
I think most of my audience knows,

9
00:00:27,881 --> 00:00:31,540
at least a portion of, I don't think
anyone knows that much about you.

10
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:35,230
What do we need to know about James
O'keefe, the man? How did he become this,

11
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,430
this rogue reporter and guy that was
unearthing all of the evil things that are

12
00:00:39,431 --> 00:00:41,290
tech overlords are doing to us?

13
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:45,460
Well, I started in college doing
these undercover tapes. Uh,

14
00:00:45,461 --> 00:00:47,230
I actually started 15 years ago,

15
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:50,110
started a newspaper in
college called the Centurion.

16
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:54,970
And I quickly learned that the way to
expose these institutions is to sort of

17
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:58,240
make them live up to their own principles.
Like the Alinsky tactic.

18
00:00:58,241 --> 00:01:01,100
I'd read rules for radicals by
Saul Alinsky in college and I,

19
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:06,400
I decided to expose hypocrisy by
making them live up to their own rules.

20
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:11,430
And I realized that those rules were
race and sex and sort of abortion,

21
00:01:11,981 --> 00:01:16,270
these sort of sacred cow institutions,
planned parenthood and acorn.

22
00:01:16,271 --> 00:01:20,260
And I decided to use hidden cameras.
I went into the dining hall at Rutgers,

23
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:25,570
I on Saint Patrick's Day and I said that
lucky charms offends my Irish heritage.

24
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:29,260
They took me seriously and told
us they would remove lucky charms.

25
00:01:29,261 --> 00:01:31,210
Cereal is the first video that I did.

26
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:35,680
And from there I actually went on
to work with, uh, uh, Lila rose,

27
00:01:35,681 --> 00:01:38,560
who you had on the show recently and some
and planned parenthood investigations.

28
00:01:38,561 --> 00:01:43,561
Acorn with Andrew Breitbart and I have
done some 200 undercover investigations

29
00:01:43,731 --> 00:01:46,000
in the last 10 years.
I assume as you

30
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:49,190
do more undercover things and now
you've got other people that are,

31
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:50,410
that are doing a portion of them,

32
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:54,200
it gets harder and harder to do as
people know who you are and know the

33
00:01:54,201 --> 00:01:55,070
organization and things.

34
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:58,990
You'd be surprised. I mean it, the
moment we read the Society of waste,

35
00:01:58,991 --> 00:02:01,720
fraud and abuse,
I suppose we will win the day,

36
00:02:01,721 --> 00:02:04,780
but people are always
going to be in power,

37
00:02:04,781 --> 00:02:09,250
tends to corrupt and absolute
power corrupts absolutely.
And money and, and, uh,

38
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,280
things that develop.
People all are always going to be corrupt.

39
00:02:12,281 --> 00:02:15,880
So I don't actually wear the
camera these days very often.

40
00:02:15,881 --> 00:02:20,080
I sort of go out into the field to,
to be a leader to the troops.

41
00:02:20,081 --> 00:02:21,850
But for the most part it's,
it's,

42
00:02:21,851 --> 00:02:25,210
we've got dozens of these people across
the United States with wearing these

43
00:02:25,211 --> 00:02:29,440
little cameras. You put them in, you
can put them in a cup for, you know,

44
00:02:29,441 --> 00:02:32,820
you can put them in a book, you can put
them in a watch. And as long as you're,

45
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:36,280
I ask you if there's more
than four cameras in the
studio right now. Cause I got,

46
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:39,530
there's a war. There's a few over
there. Yes. Um, but you know,

47
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:42,490
but as long as there's one party
consenting to the conversation,

48
00:02:42,491 --> 00:02:44,560
as long as that you're,
you're talking to someone,

49
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:47,350
there's no expectation of privacy.
We would argue.

50
00:02:47,351 --> 00:02:50,290
And we won in federal court in
Massachusetts a few months ago. We,

51
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:52,660
we changed the law.
So it's,

52
00:02:52,661 --> 00:02:56,110
we believe that secretly recording
someone is a fundamental human right.

53
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:59,020
It's a constitutional right
because I have no duty.

54
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:00,550
Keep confidential what you tell me.

55
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:05,230
So the hidden camera is an extension of
the reporter notebook and the cameras

56
00:03:05,231 --> 00:03:09,880
capture things that words don't, I mean
cameras capture, intonation, inflection.

57
00:03:09,881 --> 00:03:13,570
And so we believe that this is a kind
of transparency revolution and there's a

58
00:03:13,571 --> 00:03:16,660
movement of people doing
this in a weird way.

59
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,910
It is sort of depressing reality.

60
00:03:18,911 --> 00:03:22,960
Like when I've watched some of your
videos and you get engineers at these

61
00:03:22,961 --> 00:03:25,380
companies and we're going to, we're
going to talk about all of them, uh,

62
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:29,140
to admit things that we all are sort
of thinking or true related to shadow

63
00:03:29,141 --> 00:03:31,660
banning or d boosting where everything
else, there's a piece of me,

64
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:35,620
even when they're, they're tipping off
the information that I suspect is true.

65
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,380
There's a piece of me that's
like, this is, this is,

66
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:41,410
there's something sort of depressing
about this that this is what we've been

67
00:03:41,411 --> 00:03:44,020
left with. Like we have
to go after, you know,

68
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:47,440
mid level and sometimes low level
engineers and sometimes the bigger ones.

69
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:50,980
But because there's no transparency
when it comes to these companies.

70
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:53,410
So it feels almost depressing to me.
Does that mean, does that make sense?

71
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,430
I think the way that I would put it,
like it's unfortunate, I suppose I,

72
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,400
some people call it depressing,
some people say it. Could
we confirm suspicions?

73
00:04:00,401 --> 00:04:04,810
I would say that what we do is
summon righteous indignation, uh,

74
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,660
at the tragedies in society,

75
00:04:07,661 --> 00:04:12,250
including in these organizations
because they run so counter to what were

76
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,520
spoonfed the narratives that
were spoon fed by the media,

77
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:19,630
by the powers that be so Hidden Camera
Journal and investigative reporting,

78
00:04:19,631 --> 00:04:24,310
whether it's hidden camera or print
does that it summons what I to Tarbell

79
00:04:24,311 --> 00:04:28,480
termed as righteous indignation at the
tragedies. And it kind of, you know,

80
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:33,220
most people, I would say 80%, there's
a sort of consensus around what we do.

81
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:36,790
People say, well that's wrong
or they deny it. So Twitter, uh,

82
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:39,730
Twitter lobbyist in
Congress under oath said,

83
00:04:39,731 --> 00:04:44,290
we do not shadow banned when his
engineer clearly said what we do.

84
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:47,860
Do is shadow band and we,
I don't know if we do that anymore.

85
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:51,580
That's what the engineer said. Clearly
meaning that he had shadow banned people.

86
00:04:51,581 --> 00:04:55,060
So, um, it's, it's perjury to
lie under oath and, and you know,

87
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:59,650
these hidden camera videos really show
people what's going on at angers people.

88
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:02,770
I think the world is more
polarized than it was 10 years ago.

89
00:05:02,771 --> 00:05:06,970
So maybe that 80% consensus
is, is, is going down.

90
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,660
Are you worried at all though that will
always be videotaping each other and

91
00:05:10,661 --> 00:05:13,960
that there will be nothing that's private.
I mean, even now if I go out to dinner,

92
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:17,710
like I'm aware that I'm some level of
a public person and sometimes people

93
00:05:17,711 --> 00:05:20,590
recognize me and sometimes I was at the
airport and it was very obvious to me

94
00:05:20,591 --> 00:05:22,120
that the guy,
I was sitting with somebody,

95
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:25,330
but that the guy next to me clearly knew
who I was and he was on his computer

96
00:05:25,331 --> 00:05:28,360
and the whole time I can think of this
guy could be recording me, you know? And,

97
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:31,150
and just all like just this
endless big brother thing.

98
00:05:31,151 --> 00:05:34,330
Even if the intentions of what you're
doing. I do believe to be good.

99
00:05:34,331 --> 00:05:37,240
Are you just worried about just that
general state of we're all going to be

100
00:05:37,241 --> 00:05:39,400
recording each other all the time?
There will be nothing private.

101
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:40,510
I'm not worried at all.

102
00:05:40,511 --> 00:05:43,450
I mean there's an element of risk every
time you interact with strangers and you

103
00:05:43,451 --> 00:05:47,110
talk to them, as long as there's one
party present to the conversation,

104
00:05:47,111 --> 00:05:48,640
we would argue that it's ethical.
And again,

105
00:05:48,641 --> 00:05:53,440
we think that camera's visuals are
merely an extension. I mean I could,

106
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:56,080
I could disseminate what
you tell me in private.

107
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:59,630
I could write it down and shout it from
the rooftops opt ins and clarity wrote

108
00:05:59,631 --> 00:06:03,310
the jungle. He saw everything and then
he ran back to his hotel and wrote,

109
00:06:03,311 --> 00:06:06,080
wrote it all down.
So surely society would would,

110
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:10,460
would rather a situation
where I accurately capture
what it is that you told me

111
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:14,390
and I have to use cameras. They indemnify
me because people call me a liar.

112
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,480
They say that didn't happen.
So I have to,

113
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:19,700
I have to record the
incidents because they would,

114
00:06:19,701 --> 00:06:22,940
they would say that it did not
happen the way that I reported it.

115
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:26,600
And they also think that I think that
there are lines that we can't cross.

116
00:06:26,601 --> 00:06:30,680
We don't go into people's bedrooms, we
try to stay away from the really personal,

117
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:33,740
intimate, you know, sexual
details about, about people.

118
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:38,000
But this is a revolution that's
aimed at the power structure at this

119
00:06:38,001 --> 00:06:42,590
establishment, the powers that be not
against private citizens. And we don't.

120
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:43,790
And I think there was a duty,

121
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:48,290
there is a responsibility
that investigative reporters
have not to put people on

122
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:51,800
blast unless it really meets
a compelling public interest.

123
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,920
So you mentioned you started this in,
in college.

124
00:06:54,921 --> 00:06:59,000
What was tipping you off to like that
there was something wrong with the media?

125
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:00,170
I mean,
what made you go,

126
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:03,800
I gotta go in there and say I'm Irish
and I'm offended by Leptin charms.

127
00:07:03,801 --> 00:07:07,070
Like what really was happening that
you were seeing that led to that? Well,

128
00:07:07,071 --> 00:07:10,730
I was in at Rutgers University in New
Jersey and it was so the political

129
00:07:10,731 --> 00:07:13,380
correctness was run a muck like
most schools and all these daily,

130
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,230
there's something bad happening with the
grease trucks please. The grease trucks,

131
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:20,600
trucks, trucks, please tell
me that they're okay. It's
for those who don't know,

132
00:07:20,601 --> 00:07:24,230
they're these trucks at Rutgers and it's
like they're all in the parking lot and

133
00:07:24,231 --> 00:07:27,830
uh, and you get real fat real quick,
older, your collar, there was something,

134
00:07:27,831 --> 00:07:30,470
you know what? There was something wrong
with the gross trucks. They had duct,

135
00:07:30,471 --> 00:07:34,340
they'd put duct tape. This is
in 2005, over these sandwiches.

136
00:07:34,341 --> 00:07:37,550
Am I allowed to curse on them?
There was one of them called the fat,

137
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,530
the fat bitch and the fat,

138
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:44,200
a dyke and other words that
were offensive. And um,

139
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:48,230
they had put duct tape over the names
because these words were considered

140
00:07:48,231 --> 00:07:52,340
offensive. That's what was the, like what
compelled me to try to ban lucky charms.

141
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:56,300
So I said, this is ridiculous. I also
had professors who were Stalinists.

142
00:07:56,301 --> 00:07:59,030
I had professors who were telling me
how great communist Communism was.

143
00:07:59,031 --> 00:08:00,920
And I was not political,

144
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:04,850
but I read the New York Times every day
front to back in college in the dining

145
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:06,860
hall. I was sort of an
introverted guy and I'd read,

146
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:11,510
read the paper and I was just, I said,
this doesn't accurately capture the world.

147
00:08:11,511 --> 00:08:15,290
This doesn't, this doesn't tell
people what's really going on. So I,

148
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:19,730
I felt compelled to do something
about it and it wasn't comfortable.

149
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,920
It's not comfortable to confront
people with cameras and, you know,

150
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:23,840
get into their faces.

151
00:08:23,841 --> 00:08:28,150
But I was willed to do it because I
believed in the cause and, and the,

152
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:30,860
the kind of Alinsky, uh, methodology,

153
00:08:30,861 --> 00:08:33,790
which is to make them accountable
to their own principles. You know,

154
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:38,800
you had these Marxist professors driving
Bentleys and BMWs and had a little muck

155
00:08:38,991 --> 00:08:42,950
raking newspaper and it was
like lifestyles of the rich
and Marxist. Right, right.

156
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:46,610
You know, track these people down. I
just feel that most people that do this,

157
00:08:46,611 --> 00:08:50,900
most insiders inside these companies
coming to us now have what I call it

158
00:08:50,901 --> 00:08:52,130
justice complex.

159
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:56,250
They think that there are things wrong
with the world and they feel compelled to

160
00:08:56,251 --> 00:09:00,360
do something about it. It's
hard to explain. Uh, but
you know, I'm sure you know,

161
00:09:00,361 --> 00:09:04,620
people who have this complex and these
people are willing to basically jump on a

162
00:09:04,621 --> 00:09:08,730
grenade to wear a camera,
to film their employer.

163
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,760
Some cases violating their
own nondisclosure agreement
because they believe the

164
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:15,060
public has a right to
know what they're seeing.

165
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:19,530
Are you shocked at the amount of people
at these big tech companies who now are

166
00:09:19,531 --> 00:09:20,430
willing to speak?

167
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:24,300
Because I mean I know insiders
that I get some information from,

168
00:09:24,301 --> 00:09:25,980
I mean I'm talking about Google,
Facebook,

169
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:31,260
Twitter like that really these things
have become so huge that now their own

170
00:09:31,261 --> 00:09:34,800
people inside them are going, Whoa,
what, what did we help create here?

171
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:37,230
I'm not sure. Got a frack,
a Frankenstein Monster.

172
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:42,000
I mean I have you been to Menlo Park and
you go to San Francisco and I was there,

173
00:09:42,001 --> 00:09:43,380
cause I did this Facebook story,

174
00:09:43,381 --> 00:09:47,910
this insider inside Facebook and I went
to try to locate these engineers and ask

175
00:09:47,911 --> 00:09:50,310
them for comment.
And there were just these buses,

176
00:09:50,311 --> 00:09:54,300
just hundreds of buses filled
with millennials and end,

177
00:09:54,301 --> 00:09:57,750
if you go to the campus, people are
sort of driving around these bicycles.

178
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,360
The best word I can describe
it as their minions.

179
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:04,470
It's to sort of this little totalitarian
little mini state within a state.

180
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,540
And it's just a group think or,
well Ian Place and I,

181
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:10,191
and I guess the,

182
00:10:10,191 --> 00:10:14,010
the word that it was described to me by
the insights that they're all minions.

183
00:10:14,011 --> 00:10:17,640
They're very intelligent people but they
don't have a lot of common sense and

184
00:10:17,641 --> 00:10:19,470
there, and I, and I went there,

185
00:10:19,471 --> 00:10:22,680
I was amazed by this Menlo
Park campus buses of,

186
00:10:22,681 --> 00:10:25,170
of young people being bused in.

187
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,620
And I think that it doesn't surprise
me that people are willing to blow the

188
00:10:28,621 --> 00:10:31,950
whistle because there's more to
life than, than making, you know,

189
00:10:31,951 --> 00:10:34,690
a quarter million dollars a
year and working for these
companies. People want to,

190
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:38,910
people want to do something. One of the
things that I get told all the time,

191
00:10:38,911 --> 00:10:42,900
what can I do? And, and there aren't a lot
of choices for people. You know, you can,

192
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:45,390
you can watch the shows,
you can buy the books,

193
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:49,750
but some people want to actually
participate in this country. And,

194
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:53,550
and solutions are increasingly, you
know, outside the scope of government,

195
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:56,910
the legislative process does not
seem to solve things. So there's,

196
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:59,690
there needs to be in a
different counterweight.

197
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:04,700
There needs to be a different solution
and I would say that 0.001% of people are

198
00:11:05,821 --> 00:11:09,450
like put a camera on me. That's a lot of
people by the way. Yeah, right, right,

199
00:11:09,451 --> 00:11:11,430
right. We're talking about a lot
of people at the end of the day.

200
00:11:11,431 --> 00:11:15,210
So when did you realize that because
you've mostly focused or at least I think

201
00:11:15,211 --> 00:11:15,950
the the,

202
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:19,620
the work that has gotten you the most
attention has been related to the tech

203
00:11:19,621 --> 00:11:23,430
companies, not necessarily going
after politicians or academics per se,

204
00:11:23,431 --> 00:11:24,510
although you've done some of that.

205
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:28,140
When did you realize that focusing
on the tech companies was,

206
00:11:28,141 --> 00:11:31,200
was really the thing that was going to
strike the chord with most people because

207
00:11:31,201 --> 00:11:33,990
that's what it seems to be. Well, because
I think the media has all the power.

208
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:38,310
I think that I've known this for ever
since I started this endeavor was that the

209
00:11:38,311 --> 00:11:40,910
media has so much more
power than people realize.

210
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,330
Everyone knows the media is powerful,

211
00:11:42,331 --> 00:11:47,331
but I think that people fear the
humiliating power of the press.

212
00:11:47,641 --> 00:11:48,600
I think the press,

213
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:51,840
including the big tech companies
have more power than government.

214
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:55,870
They are more powerful
than all three branches of
government, executive, judicial,

215
00:11:55,871 --> 00:11:59,380
legislative branch. So somehow we
need to hold these people accountable.

216
00:11:59,381 --> 00:12:02,530
They're not a cat, they're not held
accountable by anybody who elects them.

217
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:06,190
And I don't know what the
solutions are. People say, well,

218
00:12:06,191 --> 00:12:07,300
what should they be regulated?

219
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:11,890
I think they should be transparent
or there will need to be regulated,

220
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,470
but they have to at least
not deceive the people.

221
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,750
So because the media has all the power,
I,

222
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:20,770
I wrote this book called American Proverb
de and I believe that people don't

223
00:12:20,771 --> 00:12:24,400
know that they're being lied to by CNN
and the New York Times and they don't

224
00:12:24,401 --> 00:12:29,260
know that they're being d boosted in
shadow, banned by Twitter and Facebook.

225
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:33,240
And I think these companies need
to tell you that they're doing it.

226
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:36,970
It's not so bad if they take
your account down and restore it.

227
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:41,200
But the thing that's really scary about
the d boosting and the shadow banning is

228
00:12:41,201 --> 00:12:45,580
that you don't know that it is
happening to you. And I have to see it.

229
00:12:45,581 --> 00:12:46,810
You can kind of feel it.

230
00:12:46,811 --> 00:12:50,860
There are times when everything I'm
doing is on fire or then sometimes where

231
00:12:50,861 --> 00:12:54,790
it's just like nothing happens and those
usually have a certain political bent

232
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:58,780
to them and then you end up really feeling
like you're in a mental institution

233
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:00,400
because if you don't have
evidence of anything,

234
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,560
I don't want to be the guy that's
running around and screaming,

235
00:13:02,561 --> 00:13:05,280
everything's a conspiracy and they're
coming after me and leaving the rest.

236
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:08,260
We're doing this on youtube right now.
And even when you do have evidence,

237
00:13:08,261 --> 00:13:11,590
like we have video tape after
tape of people inside Twitter,

238
00:13:11,591 --> 00:13:15,990
including the Twitter direct messaging
guy saying that they have certain key

239
00:13:15,991 --> 00:13:18,820
words and they consider
to be a Russian Bot.

240
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:22,270
If you tweet about God
guns and the American flag,

241
00:13:22,271 --> 00:13:25,690
most of these engineers are not,
some of them are not American citizens.

242
00:13:25,691 --> 00:13:30,220
Then they don't share American values.
And this individual says,

243
00:13:30,221 --> 00:13:33,070
if you tweet about fly, he's who
talks like that, who talks about God,

244
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:36,730
you must be a Russian Bot.
I have the videotape and they still,

245
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:40,270
they still say it's fake. So, you
know, I think that what, you know,

246
00:13:40,271 --> 00:13:44,320
it's one of those things where people
need to see this stuff and the lead and

247
00:13:44,321 --> 00:13:47,890
that just want these companies
to be honest about what
they're doing. They just,

248
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,530
I just want them to be honest. That's
why I want to be honest though. I mean,

249
00:13:50,531 --> 00:13:53,440
we want them to be honest, right? So I'm
with you. I want them to be honest and,

250
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:55,990
and the reason I apply
as much pressure on them,

251
00:13:55,991 --> 00:13:59,230
on Twitter and youtube particularly is
because I want them to be better. Right?

252
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:02,230
Like I, I always say this, it's
like I've got a million subscribers.

253
00:14:02,231 --> 00:14:06,070
I put out a television quality
show on Youtube for free,

254
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:09,160
and I don't even have an email
address to someone at Youtube.

255
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:13,360
I have no contact at someone at Youtube.
Like that's rigid. Timidly crazy.

256
00:14:13,361 --> 00:14:16,000
They're a huge company
that offers a product.

257
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:19,840
I'm a user of the product that helps make
them money through advertising and all

258
00:14:19,841 --> 00:14:22,450
that stuff. I can't even
get a human there, but I,

259
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:25,250
but I don't think I can force
them to be better. Right. Well,

260
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:29,530
it's the job of investigative reporting
to hold people accountable to, to,

261
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:33,160
to test and affirm what
is an outrage to people.

262
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,530
And I think that you can't lie
under oath. You can't. I mean,

263
00:14:35,531 --> 00:14:39,280
Mark Zuckerberg said in,
in Congress last spring,

264
00:14:39,281 --> 00:14:43,620
some things that may be contradicted by
some of the documents we've unearthed,

265
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:45,930
there are laws against perjury and the,

266
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:49,930
and what people have to remember is I
don't have a position on whether these

267
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:54,080
companies should be regulated.
I honestly don't know what should be done.

268
00:14:54,081 --> 00:14:57,800
I do know that people need to know
what is happening inside the companies,

269
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:02,630
and I think that because
they're so powerful, people
have no idea you when you,

270
00:15:02,631 --> 00:15:05,000
when you digest content from
CNN and the New York Times,

271
00:15:05,001 --> 00:15:07,190
all that stuff gets filtered
through Facebook. In fact,

272
00:15:07,191 --> 00:15:08,390
when I did the Facebook story,

273
00:15:08,391 --> 00:15:13,250
I was shocked by some people in
media telling me, while I don't know,

274
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:15,560
I love the story, but I don't
know if I can cover it. Why not?

275
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,900
Because we derive most of
our revenue from Facebook.

276
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,660
The same thing happened during
the 2016 election. When I,

277
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:24,110
when I did the Hillary Clinton tapes
and the Bob Creamer resigned. I mean,

278
00:15:24,111 --> 00:15:27,200
people have to remember that these
companies are publicly traded companies.

279
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,020
They get their broadcast
license from the FCC.

280
00:15:30,021 --> 00:15:32,780
In some circumstances there
sort of entanglements.

281
00:15:32,781 --> 00:15:37,781
There's a symbiotic relationship between
the corporate press and the government.

282
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:40,550
And for those reasons,
again,

283
00:15:40,551 --> 00:15:43,760
to go back to the campaign
to recruit insiders,

284
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,430
it's going to require citizens.

285
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:51,200
It's gonna require outsiders to blow
the whistle because no one in the

286
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:55,040
government is going to do it. Indeed,
many of them around the take. Okay.

287
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:59,330
So let's just do each platform or one at
a time. So you just mentioned Facebook.

288
00:15:59,331 --> 00:16:00,290
So let's go to phase.
What do,

289
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:04,730
what do we need to know about what's
going on with the Facebook algorithm and

290
00:16:04,731 --> 00:16:08,920
the way they're banning
people in suspending people
and the rest of it? Well,

291
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,620
I can tell you what our insider told us,
saying I can,

292
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,910
I try to only speak about
the things that I know.

293
00:16:13,911 --> 00:16:18,911
100% in the insider was
working in the content review,

294
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,280
uh,
the content review tool at Facebook.

295
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,540
And she was a contractor
for the company and she, uh,

296
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:31,340
leaked us documents inside the company
showing I guess what would be called as a

297
00:16:31,341 --> 00:16:33,920
de boost of a live stream video.

298
00:16:33,921 --> 00:16:38,810
And she said she specifically saw
this on Steven Crowder's page. Um,

299
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,640
uh,
she saw it on a few other pages.

300
00:16:40,641 --> 00:16:44,720
She took a screenshot of a Mike Cernovich
page and on the page it says I action

301
00:16:44,721 --> 00:16:46,400
live distribution.

302
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:51,590
This was apparently some type of algorithm
written too from what we could see,

303
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:55,970
two to reduce content that
was suicidal or violent,

304
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:58,820
but none of these
individuals were talking or,

305
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:01,160
or doing anything that
would rise to that level.

306
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:04,370
And now there's two different parts of
Facebook. People need to understand.

307
00:17:04,371 --> 00:17:08,870
There is a task system where it seems
like Facebook after the election hired

308
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:13,070
hundreds if not thousands of people to
monitor. And they do a fairly good job.

309
00:17:13,071 --> 00:17:15,890
If your page gets taken down,
it can be reinstated,

310
00:17:15,891 --> 00:17:19,760
you can file a complaint and they,
they have a pretty good process.

311
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:24,500
But then there's another part of Facebook
that this insight or told us about or

312
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:26,660
these were,
this algorithm was occurring.

313
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:31,700
And it was occurring automatically and
they were identifying certain key words.

314
00:17:31,701 --> 00:17:35,270
So she leaks us this troll report,
it's called a troll report.

315
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:40,710
And after the election, Facebook decided
to Chino to get more involved in,

316
00:17:40,711 --> 00:17:41,630
in,
in things,

317
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:45,680
I guess they didn't like the outcome of
the election and maybe that's what this

318
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:49,550
was. It was really about, I mean,
independent people having an impact on,

319
00:17:49,551 --> 00:17:50,430
on society.
They don't,

320
00:17:50,431 --> 00:17:52,680
they don't like that and they're
in hitting needs more control.

321
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:56,410
So they had this troll report.
There are certain key words, uh,

322
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:00,270
words that we're not racist or,
or problematic really,

323
00:18:00,271 --> 00:18:04,740
but they were words that were appropriated
by, by right wing meme culture,

324
00:18:04,741 --> 00:18:08,830
words like lulls and normy.
And even the, even the, the,

325
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:12,690
the MSM mainstream media
was in this troll report.

326
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:16,920
Since typically right wingers
use MSM more than the left.

327
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:21,420
And these are just words or phrases or
acronyms that usually are just men in

328
00:18:21,421 --> 00:18:26,400
meme. Funny Sharon, silly ways. These
are not a threat to democracy. Msm,

329
00:18:26,401 --> 00:18:29,910
mainstream media is not an implication
of racism. Well, they also blow up,

330
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:33,090
brought up Lauren Chen, they,
they, they brought her up. It was,

331
00:18:33,091 --> 00:18:38,091
she was in there as an example of
someone who is needs to be dealt with.

332
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,730
Visa VI, the, the, uh, the product
intervention at Facebook. And I don't,

333
00:18:41,731 --> 00:18:45,090
I don't know, I'm not aware of any
of any activities or problems with,

334
00:18:45,091 --> 00:18:48,960
with her videos. I mean, she's just
someone who's sharing her mind on youtube.

335
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,910
I'm not sure what order
we're putting these up in,

336
00:18:50,911 --> 00:18:53,540
but I've got Laura and chat and
coming in here. That's so cool.

337
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:58,440
Well that says it's a cosmic coincidence.
So, so she likes us these documents,

338
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:02,670
uh, we put the story out instantly.
What happens is the press, uh,

339
00:19:02,671 --> 00:19:06,690
the verge was the name of the outlet
comes out, comes to Facebook's defense.

340
00:19:06,691 --> 00:19:08,580
It always happens, by the way,
we did the story on Twitter.

341
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:12,880
And instantly buzzfeed comes out of the
Twitter says they don't do this because

342
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,660
that's not, that's not journalism. I mean,

343
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,270
Twitter says the job of
investigative reporting is to,

344
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,490
is to question what they tell you.

345
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:24,630
But it's always the case when we do these
videos that people come out and they

346
00:19:24,631 --> 00:19:27,300
said, well, they say
they don't do this. Um,

347
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:32,040
and they came to Facebook's defense. But
the truth is these documents were real.

348
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:35,850
And the two engineers that we interviewed,
a guy named Sagey Yamamoto and Danny,

349
00:19:35,851 --> 00:19:36,091
Ben,

350
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:40,260
David actually confronted these guys on
the street in San Francisco with a film

351
00:19:40,261 --> 00:19:42,900
crew because no one would
give me any answers.

352
00:19:42,901 --> 00:19:47,010
But the documents are pretty self
explanatory and it's, it's definitely, um,

353
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:47,940
it definitely,

354
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,910
I don't know if Mark Zuckerberg knows
that these things are happening,

355
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:54,360
but if he does, he was lying
under oath. Right. So wouldn't,

356
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:58,620
the sensible thing to do if you are mark
Zuckerberg would be make sure that you

357
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:02,400
don't really know what's going on at
your company so that when you get put in

358
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:06,270
the position where you're under oath,
you can basically say anything.

359
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:08,820
And I think this would
stand true for jacket,

360
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:12,060
Twitter and a bunch of these guys
if the buck never stops with you.

361
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:16,740
And I'm sure you saw, um, Jack from
Twitter on with Joe Rogan and Tim Pool.

362
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,680
And it was like, he just struck me as, oh,

363
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:23,010
I don't really know what's
going on with my company,

364
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:27,240
but that seems like it's by design. It's
not an accident. That's interesting. Um,

365
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:31,680
uh, there's a book by Blake Harris out
in the last couple of weeks about Palmer

366
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,450
Luckey and Facebook,
and I encourage you to read it.

367
00:20:33,451 --> 00:20:36,530
It's unbelievable that this guy, uh, uh,

368
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:41,490
Palmer Luckey who founded the Oculus,
the virtual reality software was, uh,

369
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,910
was dealt with by Mark Zuckerberg
directly inside the company.

370
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:49,580
He was told not to be a Trump supporter,
him on the show actually. So, um, I,

371
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:52,660
I don't,
I don't know whether that's true or not.

372
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:55,630
I did see a Jack Dorsey,
uh,

373
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:57,940
he's never addressed
anything we've exposed,

374
00:20:57,941 --> 00:21:00,070
they don't want to deal
with the actual evidence.

375
00:21:00,071 --> 00:21:05,071
There's video tapes of Obenauf of a driver
was saying one strategy is to shadow

376
00:21:05,441 --> 00:21:08,980
banned. I mean, there's, they don't
want to actually address the evidence.

377
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:11,710
They want to say, well,
they don't know what they're
talking about. Well, you know,

378
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:14,140
and by the way,
there is a difference between,

379
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:18,430
I think anytime you have human beings
in a room making content decisions,

380
00:21:18,431 --> 00:21:20,440
subjectively you're going
to have these problems.

381
00:21:20,441 --> 00:21:22,510
These are hard problems to solve.

382
00:21:22,511 --> 00:21:26,590
But it goes back to the original point
of hiring hundreds if not thousands of

383
00:21:26,591 --> 00:21:29,450
people do the content review.
I think at the end of the day,

384
00:21:29,451 --> 00:21:34,420
if these companies don't
like an independent people
influencing the minds of

385
00:21:34,421 --> 00:21:36,790
other people,
that's what this is really about.

386
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:41,340
And that would actually be okay if they
were transparent about it, sort of,

387
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:44,700
because then it would allow
competition to fill that void.

388
00:21:44,701 --> 00:21:47,490
But this sort of neither here nor
there and instead of it seems to be the

389
00:21:47,491 --> 00:21:51,930
problem. So, okay, so d boosting seems
to be the main problem with Facebook.

390
00:21:51,931 --> 00:21:54,570
And that's interesting that
it was hitting Crowder videos,

391
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:57,420
Lauren and Shannon and a couple of
other people, and this means you're,

392
00:21:57,430 --> 00:22:01,170
you're streaming, right? So this means
when he's streaming that the, the number,

393
00:22:01,171 --> 00:22:02,980
it's just not going to feed,
is that

394
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:05,910
right? It's, it's when you're,
when you do a live stream video,

395
00:22:05,911 --> 00:22:10,170
there are special tags, there are
special qualities in that live stream,

396
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,270
and they down rank the video,

397
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:16,680
they take away some of the
special qualities that make
it automatically show up

398
00:22:16,681 --> 00:22:20,760
on other people's timelines according
to the insider that we spoke to.

399
00:22:20,761 --> 00:22:23,280
The other thing about these videos
that are live streamers that they're

400
00:22:23,281 --> 00:22:28,230
converted to text automatically
and machine learning goes
through the video and

401
00:22:28,231 --> 00:22:31,890
identifies these keywords. So yes,
the video would be down ranked.

402
00:22:31,891 --> 00:22:35,120
It would have its special
qualities taken away. And, uh,

403
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:39,570
I think that Crowder settled out
of court in 2016 with Facebook.

404
00:22:39,571 --> 00:22:43,110
It's what he told me.
And I think that he's in the process of,

405
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:46,140
of doing some more litigation related to
some of the things they're doing to his

406
00:22:46,141 --> 00:22:46,830
videos.

407
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:49,140
Yeah. Is there anything else that you
need to know on the Facebook front?

408
00:22:49,141 --> 00:22:51,570
You've said they've gotten a
little bit better when it comes to,

409
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,870
they would ban people in suspend
people left and right all the time.

410
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:58,550
I used to have my, my friend Faisal Omar,
who's been on the show many times, who's,

411
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:00,630
uh,
an ex Muslim from,

412
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,170
from Iraq and really working
to secularize the Arab world.

413
00:23:04,171 --> 00:23:07,320
I mean doing incredible, incredible
work. I mean, this is a good man.

414
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:10,710
He would get banned all the
time, right? And I would have,

415
00:23:10,711 --> 00:23:13,920
I had a contact there so I was
able to help him get back on that.

416
00:23:13,921 --> 00:23:16,780
Seems to be happening a
little bit less now. I logged

417
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:19,990
in there, the, the insiders showed
me how it works. There's it,

418
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:24,490
I guess what you call a task
function and um, and you know,

419
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:27,400
someone gets there. There are, there
are independent people in the company,

420
00:23:27,401 --> 00:23:31,480
low level people who just make arbitrary
decisions to remove people and then

421
00:23:31,481 --> 00:23:32,980
that's wrong and they shouldn't do that.

422
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:36,550
So there are adult supervision in the
room. There are, there are people,

423
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:39,630
there's like a conversation
thread under each task.

424
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:42,220
They convert these things
into what they call tasks.

425
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:44,680
And there are adults that say,
well that's no good.

426
00:23:44,681 --> 00:23:48,170
And there relationships with a
lot of the publishers for um,

427
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:50,570
entities like such as your own. And, and,

428
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:54,110
and there was a relationship between a
sales rep at Facebook and there seemed to

429
00:23:54,111 --> 00:23:55,130
be adult supervision.

430
00:23:55,131 --> 00:23:58,970
But the problem is with the algorithm
side of things as far as I can see.

431
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:02,840
So He's part of it that the algorithm,
in many cases they will,

432
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:06,600
the algorithms were written by people,
you know, 10 years ago or 15 years ago,

433
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:07,940
probably aren't at the company anymore.

434
00:24:07,941 --> 00:24:12,680
Nobody really like who really understands
what's going on with these algorithms.

435
00:24:12,681 --> 00:24:16,760
Do the engineers at these companies even
have a sense of what's really going on

436
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:20,840
and how can they make sure that they're
not manipulated by the low level people

437
00:24:20,841 --> 00:24:24,200
in? Well, one of the problems I have is a
reporter doing this is trying to, I mean,

438
00:24:24,201 --> 00:24:25,640
I'm not a tech person.
I'm not a,

439
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:28,460
I don't claim to have any
special expertise is trying to,

440
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:32,980
people's eyes glaze over when you start
talking about machine learning and uh,

441
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:35,600
and,
and SSI livestream distribution.

442
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:39,980
So trying to get the people indignant
about something that they have no idea

443
00:24:39,981 --> 00:24:42,140
what this means. But
yes, I think Danny, Ben,

444
00:24:42,141 --> 00:24:47,141
David wrote the algorithm at Facebook in
2017 than it was apparently intended to

445
00:24:47,721 --> 00:24:50,900
address violence or suicidal content.

446
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:55,850
And we believe that it was a applied
to politics and it was used for ill.

447
00:24:55,851 --> 00:24:57,470
That seems to be what
happened at Facebook.

448
00:24:57,710 --> 00:25:00,230
So you're saying the road to hell is
paved with good intentions, right?

449
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:01,770
Is that what you're telling me?
Uh,

450
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:04,470
anything else going on in Facebook
that we need to know about it? And,

451
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:09,140
and do you sense that Zuckerberg may
be because of being hauled in front of

452
00:25:09,141 --> 00:25:11,030
Congress will do anything?

453
00:25:11,031 --> 00:25:14,570
I can tell you that everyone inside
the company knows what we did. And uh,

454
00:25:14,571 --> 00:25:16,670
there's one,
I don't know how many 60,000 employees,

455
00:25:16,671 --> 00:25:18,380
they all know exactly what we did.

456
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:21,950
And I think that when we personalize
it by going to the men went to the

457
00:25:21,951 --> 00:25:23,300
engineer's doors,
we went to,

458
00:25:23,301 --> 00:25:26,240
we went to the train station where the
guy gets on the train every morning and I

459
00:25:26,241 --> 00:25:29,750
interviewed him and he said, I fear for my
safety. He's like, I'm scared. I'm like,

460
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:31,670
you're scaring.
I should be afraid for my safety.

461
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:35,790
I mean you guys are the ones spying
on us and taking our videos down and,

462
00:25:35,791 --> 00:25:39,200
and not to that, but I'm going after
this trillion dollar company. Um,

463
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:42,860
but we personalized it.
And I think that there's a lot in,

464
00:25:42,861 --> 00:25:45,200
since I released this tape a month ago,

465
00:25:45,201 --> 00:25:50,201
there have been many people inside the
company that have approached me and I'm

466
00:25:50,811 --> 00:25:52,760
trying to,
you know,

467
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:55,820
it's always the question of do you want
to wear a camera or do you just want to

468
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:58,880
feed me things anonymously?
My medium is video.

469
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:03,320
I think that there has to be video
because if we don't take these things,

470
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,850
no one will believe it.

471
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,660
So then the person has to basically
lose their job and I'll hire them.

472
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:10,910
And that's how our,
our model tends to work these days.

473
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:13,940
How do you make sure that when someone
reaches out to you that they're not just

474
00:26:13,941 --> 00:26:16,110
trolling you? Like a triple agent? Yeah.

475
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:20,210
Well basically that they would reach out
to you knowing that you throw up one,

476
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:24,980
one bad thing and there's
been little moments. Yes, we
can get into. Yes. Um, that,

477
00:26:24,981 --> 00:26:27,950
that's going to blow up all of the
other good work that you've done.

478
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:32,240
So there's high incentive for something
else. It's a, it's a risk. It's, I mean,

479
00:26:32,241 --> 00:26:35,390
listen, what we do is very high risk
for many different reasons, which,

480
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:36,920
which we can get into I guess.

481
00:26:36,921 --> 00:26:40,220
But what we do is extremely
risky and an undercover work,

482
00:26:40,221 --> 00:26:42,650
you're going to get burned.
You try to use common sense.

483
00:26:42,651 --> 00:26:47,490
There are things that we do. Ew, ew, ew,
ew, ew, ew, ew. Go very carefully. You,

484
00:26:47,491 --> 00:26:51,210
you do your due diligence.
Oftentimes they send you something.

485
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:55,320
There is something called tortious
interference with, uh, with, you know,

486
00:26:55,321 --> 00:26:58,740
violating a nondisclosure
agreement. Um, uh, the,

487
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,530
it's a lot of complex legal analysis,

488
00:27:01,531 --> 00:27:05,790
but essentially they have to tell us
something first and then we can tell them

489
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:08,990
to film what they have told
us. So there, you know,

490
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,880
we have to be very careful and
we have been burned by the way,

491
00:27:11,881 --> 00:27:14,970
and you probably knows about some of
those things, but for the most part,

492
00:27:14,971 --> 00:27:19,920
we're 95 to 98% successful.
Not everything that people bring to us,

493
00:27:19,921 --> 00:27:20,850
do we publish?

494
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:25,110
Not Every secret conversation
that I've recorded do we publish?

495
00:27:25,111 --> 00:27:30,000
I think it's the choosing to publish
something at the video that we've obtained

496
00:27:30,001 --> 00:27:33,210
is really where the ethical
calculation comes in. All right,

497
00:27:33,211 --> 00:27:35,970
well we could probably do a show
just on Facebook, but let's,

498
00:27:35,971 --> 00:27:39,870
let's move to the others because in a
certain way I think Facebook is becoming

499
00:27:39,871 --> 00:27:42,810
increasingly irrelevant,
at least in the political space.

500
00:27:42,811 --> 00:27:45,000
I that my judgment of
that may be slightly off,

501
00:27:45,001 --> 00:27:48,120
but I just don't see that much
traction any more with young people.

502
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:51,630
Do you think that's basically fair?
I disagree. I think that Facebook,

503
00:27:51,631 --> 00:27:55,710
I think that the majority of
these companies disseminate
their content through

504
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:57,460
the social media platform.

505
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:00,270
So I think that there are always going
to be relevant and there was the dominate

506
00:28:00,271 --> 00:28:02,730
the market in terms of
advertising revenue, um,

507
00:28:02,731 --> 00:28:06,540
even even the big news organizations,
uh,

508
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:10,290
disseminate their content through
Facebook. So I think it's,

509
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:12,330
I think they are relevant.
I don't know.

510
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:14,180
I don't know what the
trajectory of that is. Yeah.

511
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:16,560
I don't mean that they're irrelevant,
but it seems to me that the,

512
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:20,850
the conversation that I really think is
important about all of this seems to be

513
00:28:20,851 --> 00:28:22,560
happening much more on Twitter.

514
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:26,070
I assume you do not necessarily that
the money and the advertising and the

515
00:28:26,071 --> 00:28:30,060
mainstream media reach and all of those
things aren't relevant on Facebook,

516
00:28:30,061 --> 00:28:32,550
but that the real sort of,
I don't know,

517
00:28:32,551 --> 00:28:35,970
the gestalt of this or something
is on Twitter and Youtube.

518
00:28:35,971 --> 00:28:40,020
So that's the last shift
there for a second. So, uh,
Twitter, I'm sure you see me,

519
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:44,190
uh, tweeting all the time about the
shadow bands and the rest of it.

520
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:47,790
So what the hell is going on
with Twitter? Well, we went,

521
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:52,650
we went undercover into Twitter and
last year in early 2018 and we caught a

522
00:28:52,651 --> 00:28:56,520
number of engineers describing
a shadow banning, uh,

523
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,880
removing posts. When people don't know
that they're sharing their content,

524
00:28:59,881 --> 00:29:01,290
they don't know that they're being banned,

525
00:29:01,291 --> 00:29:04,260
that we actually have quotes from the
engineers talking about what they have

526
00:29:04,261 --> 00:29:07,620
done. I mentioned earlier with
this, a direct messaging expert,

527
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:11,430
a guy named print icing who
works on the Twitter DM team,

528
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:16,710
says that he can peruse all of
your messages, your private dms.

529
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:22,050
Uh, he says that there are key words
that Twitter uses to filter tweets,

530
00:29:22,051 --> 00:29:25,440
uh, the American flag, God guns. Uh,

531
00:29:25,441 --> 00:29:27,630
and then then we talk to another engineer,

532
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:32,310
jump over the first one there so they
can literally look at your direct

533
00:29:32,311 --> 00:29:35,340
messaging. That's what they
told us. Private direct message.

534
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:38,510
They said they have teams.
This is a guy named Clay Haynes.

535
00:29:38,511 --> 00:29:42,730
So they have hundred hundreds plus
of people that end. He says, quote,

536
00:29:42,731 --> 00:29:44,710
I've seen a lot of Dick pics on quote.

537
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:47,560
So I understand they have
to do some of this to, to,

538
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:51,760
to ban pornography and you know,
Gore and content.

539
00:29:51,761 --> 00:29:54,520
But apparently this is what they told
us that I don't know why they'd have to

540
00:29:54,521 --> 00:29:58,300
look at your private messages, but, and
they've also said that they don't do that.

541
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,560
Right.
So that's the thing.

542
00:29:59,561 --> 00:30:02,200
Why do they say one thing in public and
another thing in private is what we've

543
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,350
found. But we began, I,

544
00:30:03,351 --> 00:30:08,080
I try to only speak to what I can actually
a videotape of what the engineer's

545
00:30:08,081 --> 00:30:12,430
said. And this Abenov for Draven guy was
there was a congressional hearing with a

546
00:30:12,431 --> 00:30:16,240
lobbyist. Ted Cruz did ask
him, uh, do you do this?

547
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:19,030
And he says we do not do that.
Well then why did your engine,

548
00:30:19,031 --> 00:30:22,180
your say they were doing it.
So I just think they're being dishonest.

549
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:27,390
So that's the type of sort of underhanded
tactic that they're using the shadow

550
00:30:28,361 --> 00:30:30,220
banning cause you have no idea.
Again,

551
00:30:30,221 --> 00:30:32,380
you just don't know when
you put something out.

552
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:35,530
Is this getting to all of
my people or is it not?

553
00:30:35,531 --> 00:30:39,370
Or can some people not retweet it or the
rest of it? I mean it's a pretty clever,

554
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:42,480
if they were trying to silence people,
it's pretty clever way of doing it. Right.

555
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:43,900
I think that's the unethical part.

556
00:30:43,901 --> 00:30:47,290
They don't tell people that they are
doing and they don't tell people their

557
00:30:47,291 --> 00:30:49,720
political positions.
I just want them to be transparent.

558
00:30:49,721 --> 00:30:52,060
I think Facebook kind a thing.
Not to go back to Facebook,

559
00:30:52,061 --> 00:30:55,480
but they put out a thing. We are,
we are banning white nationalists.

560
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,450
Well at least they're telling
us where they stand. I'm not,

561
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,910
not that that is a good thing,
white nationalism.

562
00:31:00,911 --> 00:31:03,970
But if they were to do more of
that sort of thing and say we are,

563
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,490
we are taking an editorial
perspective in the New York Times,

564
00:31:06,491 --> 00:31:10,630
The Washington Post, you can see on
the op ed pages what they believe in.

565
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:14,110
They're there. They're rather transparent
about it. I would say more so.

566
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:17,580
So I think that these companies should
take an editorial position, but when,

567
00:31:17,581 --> 00:31:19,300
when we hear,
um,

568
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:24,580
print icing at Twitter on the hidden
camera, say who talks like that,

569
00:31:24,581 --> 00:31:29,581
who talks about God and the American
flag and guns must be a Russian Bot says

570
00:31:29,651 --> 00:31:32,830
print icing at Twitter.
W I'm fine with that.

571
00:31:32,831 --> 00:31:34,810
As long as you say it publicly,

572
00:31:34,811 --> 00:31:38,950
as long as you make it part of your
editorial positions so that people know,

573
00:31:38,951 --> 00:31:42,130
okay, this company is a,
is extremely left wing.

574
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:47,680
Do any of the Banning's or any of this
ever happened to people on the left?

575
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:52,700
I know there was some instances maybe
with Auntie Phi accounts are a couple of

576
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:53,531
things.
Like that,

577
00:31:53,531 --> 00:31:58,180
but it always seems like
you have conservatives and
people on the right talking

578
00:31:58,181 --> 00:31:59,950
about, yeah, I don't,
I'm not, to my knowledge,

579
00:31:59,951 --> 00:32:03,370
and I think our reporting
overwhelmingly focused on,

580
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:08,400
on why he even mentioned Donald Trump's
account and insinuated that they were,

581
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:13,410
that they were working with the government
to give information to, I dunno,

582
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:16,450
deep state individuals,
and this is clay Haynes,

583
00:32:16,451 --> 00:32:20,610
a network security engineer at Twitter
told us about Donald Trump's accounts. I,

584
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:24,090
I've never seen anything on the
other end of the spectrum from,

585
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:25,030
from my vantage point,

586
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:28,210
when Trump's cabinet got taken down for
those couple of hours and then it turned

587
00:32:28,211 --> 00:32:31,870
out to be just, what was it? They said
it was some accident or some young,

588
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:35,500
some low level guy did it for you.
That must've been like a Whoa,

589
00:32:35,501 --> 00:32:40,310
that just shows you the power that any,
any individual would have access

590
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:43,520
to be able to shut down the president.
For our, for our purposes, we're always,

591
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:44,510
I'm always trying to prove it.

592
00:32:44,511 --> 00:32:47,540
Like I want to get them on tape admitting
why they did it. But there are the,

593
00:32:47,541 --> 00:32:49,100
there are these,
you know,

594
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:52,700
I guess you could call them low level
people that do things that are not

595
00:32:52,701 --> 00:32:57,680
acceptable. Um, and it's policed
more. So at Facebook I would say.

596
00:32:57,950 --> 00:33:01,880
Yeah. Anything else going on with Twitter
and that's all that we reported on the

597
00:33:01,881 --> 00:33:03,000
shadow banning the,
the,

598
00:33:03,001 --> 00:33:07,760
the tr deprivate DMD messages and the
shadow banning where the big ones.

599
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:13,000
What do you make generally of the
political politization of Twitter?

600
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:15,410
Like specifically. So, you know,

601
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:19,220
if you were to click on the search bar
on Twitter on any given day and you see

602
00:33:19,221 --> 00:33:21,200
the Twitter moments, it's all, you know,

603
00:33:21,201 --> 00:33:23,990
they're always showing you
the Trans Story of the day or,

604
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,480
or whatever the left is
leaning with that day.

605
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:30,050
They're always sort of pushing
that down your throat. Um,

606
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:33,170
is that just consistent with everything
else you view these companies?

607
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:37,130
What I will say is that we have more
stories coming on, that sort of thing.

608
00:33:37,131 --> 00:33:40,580
So I would, I would, uh, hold my tongue
because I don't want to scoop myself.

609
00:33:40,581 --> 00:33:43,040
We've got a number of people
on the inside that are,

610
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:48,070
that are maybe focusing on the search
functions at these organizations.

611
00:33:48,501 --> 00:33:51,410
So we'll, we'll, you'll be, you have to
stay tuned to see what we young, yeah,

612
00:33:51,411 --> 00:33:53,630
that wouldn't surprise me.
I mean when I searched certain people,

613
00:33:53,631 --> 00:33:55,880
even if they're verified,
if they happen to be on the right,

614
00:33:55,881 --> 00:33:56,960
sometimes they don't pop up,

615
00:33:56,961 --> 00:34:01,220
but I get a zillion random accounts
before that or I often think that the,

616
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:06,230
um, the trending tab, right, it seems like
it's completely manipulated. You know,

617
00:34:06,231 --> 00:34:08,780
what they are commenting on
and what they're, you know,

618
00:34:08,781 --> 00:34:11,270
cause sometimes there's a comment
beneath the trend or whatever.

619
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:14,940
It all just seems made up. And, and,

620
00:34:14,990 --> 00:34:18,950
and for project Veritas, the, the
priority is to prove it is to,

621
00:34:18,951 --> 00:34:22,070
is to catch them on tape admitting it.
And that is what we will do.

622
00:34:22,071 --> 00:34:25,160
And we will have more stories soon
on, on all of this, all this friends.

623
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:28,370
So let's move to youtube.
We're on youtube right now.

624
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:31,790
I've had people in the past,
years ago when I did,

625
00:34:31,910 --> 00:34:35,600
at one time I did have an email address
of someone at Youtube. And they told me,

626
00:34:35,601 --> 00:34:38,960
cause I kept saying people
keep complaining that
they're unsubscribed from my

627
00:34:38,961 --> 00:34:39,261
channel.

628
00:34:39,261 --> 00:34:44,000
I kept getting emails every day and one
time someone from Youtube admitted to me,

629
00:34:44,001 --> 00:34:44,331
they said,

630
00:34:44,331 --> 00:34:49,010
there's a bug on your channel and we're
trying to work it out with a couple of

631
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:49,611
weeks after that,

632
00:34:49,611 --> 00:34:52,370
after I followed up a few times and then
I couldn't get any more information,

633
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:55,310
I got an email from the guy saying,
I'm no longer handling this case.

634
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:56,480
And now you have to go to the,

635
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,510
you don't have an email
address to respond to any more,

636
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:02,450
go to the general tab and
complaint or whatever. Uh,

637
00:35:02,451 --> 00:35:04,370
so I have to publicly
shame them all the time.

638
00:35:04,371 --> 00:35:06,860
You probably see me doing this
with teams of Youtube and Twitter.

639
00:35:06,861 --> 00:35:10,040
Every time I get demonetized I fight them.
And then they usually,

640
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:14,330
not always Lila rose, for example,
they did not remodel ties. Um,

641
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:17,450
they didn't remember.
They did not really monetize that one.

642
00:35:17,451 --> 00:35:21,380
It was demonetized monetized by the
algorithm and then confirmed by manual

643
00:35:21,381 --> 00:35:25,040
review.
Now that's their right to do that again.

644
00:35:25,041 --> 00:35:27,530
You want some transparency with it.
Um,

645
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:30,680
but unsubscribes,

646
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:33,320
video's not going out to
feeds all of these things.

647
00:35:33,321 --> 00:35:36,260
What evidence do we actually have
that these things are happening? Well,

648
00:35:36,261 --> 00:35:38,610
we did a story in 2017

649
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:42,090
between the New York Times reporter
named Nick Dudek and Youtube.

650
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:46,980
And again, I can only talk about what I
report. I, that's my rule. So I don't,

651
00:35:46,981 --> 00:35:49,050
I don't like to comment
on things that I don't,

652
00:35:49,051 --> 00:35:50,670
I haven't had personal experience with,

653
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:56,060
but there was a relationship between
these networks like the New York Times and

654
00:35:56,370 --> 00:36:00,930
hopping and post and, and Youtube.
And there, there are favors given to,

655
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:05,490
to these, uh, organizations
over say your show.

656
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:09,810
Um, and, and that's something that
we've, we've, we reported on an exposed.

657
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:12,330
So what would a favor look like?
Well,

658
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:16,500
preferential treatment and the end to
getting into the, the scientifics of it,

659
00:36:16,501 --> 00:36:20,040
I'm not sure, but preferential
treatment where the video would, would,

660
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:24,810
would show up more frequently at
the top of the, of the search query.

661
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,073
Um,

662
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:31,170
this guy nick and Dudek who was a social
accounts video editor for The New York

663
00:36:31,171 --> 00:36:35,610
Times, talked about his relationship
with this guy inside youtube.

664
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,620
So there's, there's a sort of, you know,

665
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:42,120
two way street there between the
two companies where favors are done,

666
00:36:42,121 --> 00:36:45,660
but with the New York Times now,
why are they doing them favors? I,

667
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:49,320
that's what I was talking about earlier
where these companies have enormous

668
00:36:49,321 --> 00:36:54,300
power because even the likes of the old
media transmit their messages through

669
00:36:54,301 --> 00:36:58,620
the new media. That's where the majority
of people get their information from. So,

670
00:36:58,621 --> 00:37:00,960
um, but that, that was that guy nick duty,

671
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:04,830
actually the executive editor of the
New York Times. Dean Baquet is his name.

672
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:09,660
Actually we believe, let that
guy go. He actually, uh, uh,

673
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:13,860
terminated Nick Dudek for
telling us this stuff.

674
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:16,590
No one reported on that.
But uh,

675
00:37:16,591 --> 00:37:20,100
I don't know whether they terminated
him for telling the truth or for or for

676
00:37:20,101 --> 00:37:22,890
lying about what he had said.
So how do you combat that?

677
00:37:22,891 --> 00:37:26,910
The part where every time you guys
released something that I look at it,

678
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:30,660
I'm always hesitant to retweet it.
I've shared some of your videos sometimes,

679
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:34,710
but I'm always like, ah, if, if
this is the one where you know,

680
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:37,110
he got duped or you know,

681
00:37:37,111 --> 00:37:42,111
it's only being shared by Breitbart or
whatever that then it's like you like

682
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:48,390
basically that you have some sort of
secondary layer of censorship to get

683
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:48,871
through.
Well,

684
00:37:48,871 --> 00:37:52,720
I'll tell you what we've done to
[inaudible] to Bose and buzzfeed and CNN.

685
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:55,020
They in touching any of this.
Well, they have touched it. I mean,

686
00:37:55,021 --> 00:37:58,380
Anderson Cooper reported on this stuff
we did during the 2016 election on

687
00:37:58,381 --> 00:38:01,860
Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump
are stories in the 2018 election,

688
00:38:01,861 --> 00:38:06,090
made the New York Times. Um, we've
gotten a lot of local media coverage.

689
00:38:06,091 --> 00:38:08,680
We've been in terms of being duped,
weave,

690
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:12,390
weave in and out of 200 undercover
investigate. They say things are edited,

691
00:38:12,391 --> 00:38:15,500
they're edited out of context.
They're, they're not real. I mean,

692
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:18,720
and you actually ask them what
specific edits are you talking about?

693
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:22,470
Because to say that video is edited and
it's like saying words are arranged.

694
00:38:22,471 --> 00:38:25,890
All journalism is edited in to
tell a story. And they said, well,

695
00:38:25,891 --> 00:38:29,850
you didn't wear the pink costume and
the acorn office will, you know, okay.

696
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:33,660
But I presented myself
as as a, as a pimp. Um,

697
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:37,510
and even the New York Times said that
and pimp protocol doesn't require wearing

698
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:42,430
of pimp, pimp if you were a big pink
jacket and drive a Cadillac. Um,

699
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:45,790
and I said, well, there was a scene
change in the NPR investigation. Okay.

700
00:38:45,791 --> 00:38:47,910
Is that the best you got? I mean the, I,

701
00:38:47,911 --> 00:38:51,190
there was a cutaway shot where the guy
was laughing and I was narrating over it

702
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:53,350
in 200 investigations.
I mean,

703
00:38:53,351 --> 00:38:56,590
they've printed 300 corrections
and attractions about me.

704
00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:00,850
I have a wall in my office called
the wall of shame and it's all these

705
00:39:00,851 --> 00:39:02,440
corrections and attractions about me.

706
00:39:02,450 --> 00:39:06,610
The Washington Post that I went after
acorn due to an animus about African

707
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:09,840
Americans voting. They made it up.
Pulitzer prize winning reporter Carol,

708
00:39:09,841 --> 00:39:14,470
letting just made something up
out of whole cloth. So there,

709
00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:19,270
I don't know, I think there is a,
I think it's not about the, um,

710
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:21,760
the, what we do is real.
The tapes. You see,

711
00:39:21,761 --> 00:39:24,520
there's never been a case
where we saw wasn't real.

712
00:39:24,970 --> 00:39:27,550
There was one thing with the
Washington Post that blew up.

713
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:31,470
They turn their cameras back around
on us and everyone you know said,

714
00:39:31,471 --> 00:39:34,000
well that's unethical.
What exactly was unethical about it?

715
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:36,040
Because we went undercover into CNN.

716
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:40,060
We infiltrated something
called a rain Bros,

717
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:44,410
which was a a gay group
where this producer was in.

718
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:46,630
Nobody questioned the ethics of it.

719
00:39:46,930 --> 00:39:50,200
Nobody questioned the ethics
because the end was so obvious.

720
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:53,890
And whether or not you think
that the means are justified,

721
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:57,100
depends upon whether you think there's a
compelling public interest and what you

722
00:39:57,101 --> 00:39:59,860
are exposing.
So when these things get interrupted,

723
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:05,200
then people say it's unethical. But we
think that undercover work is justified,

724
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:09,160
particularly into the big 10 companies
and the big media due to the urgency of

725
00:40:09,161 --> 00:40:12,490
the circumstances. But in
all of our work, no one's,

726
00:40:12,491 --> 00:40:16,180
no one's ever able to actually say
what exactly has been fake about it.

727
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:21,160
And that's from my perspective or are
you shocked at actually how the collapse

728
00:40:21,161 --> 00:40:24,880
of mainstream media has precipitated
so quickly at this point? Like,

729
00:40:24,881 --> 00:40:27,910
it seems to me that it's
just, it's over. I mean now,

730
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:29,630
just in the last couple of weeks now with,

731
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:34,670
with Trump and Russia and just the amount
that these people have just lied over

732
00:40:35,531 --> 00:40:39,460
and over. And finally, thanks to
Twitter and Youtube and the rest of it,

733
00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:41,200
if we're not being shadow
and everything right,

734
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:44,590
there's enough of us that can get
a counter narrative out there,

735
00:40:44,770 --> 00:40:49,240
but they just keep doing it. Well, I think
it's the death of, I think it's, it's uh,

736
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:52,060
uh, you've covered,
cause I watch your show,

737
00:40:52,061 --> 00:40:54,670
a lot of the political
reasons why media is dying,

738
00:40:54,671 --> 00:40:58,570
but I actually think it's goes back to
Jefferey's Zucker said in the last two

739
00:40:58,571 --> 00:41:02,380
weeks about, I don't know if you saw
that tweet where Brian Stelter said, ah,

740
00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:04,450
we're not investigators will,

741
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:08,410
that was an unbelievable moment
because that's really, they're not,

742
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:10,060
they're not investigative reporters.

743
00:41:10,061 --> 00:41:13,210
And people have to remember a thing about
CNN talking about CNN, CNN, we don't,

744
00:41:13,211 --> 00:41:15,220
we're not investigators where journalists,
so here's the thing.

745
00:41:15,221 --> 00:41:19,060
This is very important. People talk about
politics, people talk about, you know,

746
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:22,540
the media is algorithms,
but it's also economics.

747
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:24,580
Investigative reporting is very,

748
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:29,380
very expensive and it's a
naturally philanthropic activity.

749
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:32,050
Investigative reporting,
going back 40, 50 years,

750
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:34,940
it was always a loss leader on
the company's balance sheets.

751
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:37,640
People have to remember these are,
these are businesses.

752
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:40,340
They're not interested in the public
interest. They're interested in,

753
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:43,330
in generating a profit.
And that's fine, but,

754
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:46,610
but don't pretend that you
serve the public interest.

755
00:41:46,611 --> 00:41:51,320
We had a CNN insider on tape. John
Boehner field said, this is a business.

756
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:54,760
The CEO of CNN, Jeff Zucker told us, uh,

757
00:41:54,770 --> 00:41:58,070
stopped talking about the climate accords.
Let's get back to Russia.

758
00:41:58,370 --> 00:42:01,770
It's about ratings. It's not about
ethics. And it's been, it's been,

759
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:03,530
it's important to the story though.

760
00:42:03,770 --> 00:42:06,140
You're not saying there's anything
inherently wrong with that.

761
00:42:06,141 --> 00:42:09,410
He's allowed to make money. He's
allowed to do business. But,

762
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:12,590
but don't pretend you're operating in
the public interest because investigative

763
00:42:12,591 --> 00:42:16,100
reporting, and let, let, let me, let me,
you had mentioned, you know, people don't,

764
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:20,240
if people are wary of what we do,
it's naturally the tip of the spear.

765
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:23,360
You have to use deception to a degree.

766
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:28,340
Either you deceive your source
or you deceive your audience.

767
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:32,510
The problem with journalism and the reason
why it's in decline is because these

768
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:33,531
leakers,

769
00:42:33,531 --> 00:42:38,210
these sources and government and elsewhere
intentionally transmit stuff to the

770
00:42:38,211 --> 00:42:42,350
media and they paired it to the
masses. Ai, he, Jeff Zucker saying,

771
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:45,460
we don't investigate what we're
told. And that's what you know, what,

772
00:42:45,461 --> 00:42:48,110
what has been referred
to as a pseudo event.

773
00:42:48,350 --> 00:42:52,430
They create something they
transmitted unquestionably.

774
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:54,800
And there's the economic factor.

775
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:58,280
There's a symbiotic relationship
between people in power.

776
00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:02,690
What we do at Veritas is
we go undercover and we,

777
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:07,160
we completely defy the
narrative and that's,

778
00:43:07,161 --> 00:43:10,190
and most networks don't
want to air it because,

779
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:15,020
because it's risky because
it's questioning that the
normative order of things,

780
00:43:15,290 --> 00:43:18,980
it's easier to do little videos
about squirrels on skateboards.

781
00:43:19,210 --> 00:43:21,740
And I did this big story
during the election, you know,

782
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:25,460
for Bob Creamer resigned from
the Hillary Clinton campaign.

783
00:43:25,850 --> 00:43:29,750
And a lot of these companies say,
we're afraid that if Hillary Clinton wins,

784
00:43:30,170 --> 00:43:33,890
she'll take away our FCC license.
So it's, it's, it's this,

785
00:43:33,891 --> 00:43:38,891
it's this economic issue that is inherent
in media and it requires independent

786
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:44,600
people to do something about it because
the networks are not going to do

787
00:43:44,601 --> 00:43:48,080
something about it. They are, they are
in the business of generating a profit.

788
00:43:48,170 --> 00:43:51,820
It's so fascinating to me because it's
like they're not even in the business.

789
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:54,050
Right. I get it. So they're in the
business making a profit and that's fine.

790
00:43:54,051 --> 00:43:54,890
That is what businesses,

791
00:43:54,891 --> 00:43:58,400
but they're not even in the business
of pretending anymore because it's like

792
00:43:58,401 --> 00:44:00,050
during the whole Mueller investigation,

793
00:44:00,051 --> 00:44:02,930
every week there was another leak to
the New York Times and it's always an

794
00:44:02,931 --> 00:44:03,711
anonymous leak.

795
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:08,330
And then for the last two years they ran
anonymous leaks stories and it's like,

796
00:44:08,390 --> 00:44:12,110
shouldn't have, somebody had been
investigating why the Mueller, uh,

797
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:15,540
operation is leaking. That actually
would have been a story. Right.

798
00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:18,050
Where was that story out of the
New York Times? Well, they had,

799
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:19,280
and James Clapper and,

800
00:44:19,281 --> 00:44:22,610
and John Brennan and Munis are
intelligence discover who lied under oath.

801
00:44:22,630 --> 00:44:27,320
Is there an intelligence agency people
and maybe not the most always ethical

802
00:44:27,321 --> 00:44:30,720
people and they're just
parroting what they're told on,

803
00:44:30,730 --> 00:44:32,760
on TV things or when things are,
and again,

804
00:44:32,761 --> 00:44:35,970
I go back to this whole
distinction and because when you,

805
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:40,630
when you report from a podium, when you
say something at a press conference, the,

806
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:43,800
the damage to society
done by broadcasting,

807
00:44:43,801 --> 00:44:48,801
what you are told on the record is often
more pernicious than the damage that

808
00:44:49,351 --> 00:44:54,351
say I do by deceiving some guy in a bar
so that I can get the truth out of them.

809
00:44:54,930 --> 00:44:57,630
It is a, it is a huge difference. And,

810
00:44:57,631 --> 00:45:02,040
and I think that journalists tend to be
that you sort of have to play confidence

811
00:45:02,041 --> 00:45:07,000
games. You know, you have to seduce your
source so to speak. But there's, there is,

812
00:45:07,010 --> 00:45:07,711
there's a two,

813
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:12,711
there's a relationship between sources
and the media that I think has become

814
00:45:12,871 --> 00:45:14,590
corrupt.
I think that the,

815
00:45:14,591 --> 00:45:19,050
the anonymous or the reliance upon
anonymous sources has become corrupted.

816
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:22,110
You look at Bob Woodward, legendary
reporter that gives a great journalist,

817
00:45:22,111 --> 00:45:24,540
by the way, I don't think these
journalists are bad journalists.

818
00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:26,010
I don't even think they're bad people.

819
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:29,340
I think they're part of an industrial
system of production that that

820
00:45:29,341 --> 00:45:32,700
manufacturers the public's consent.
But you look at Bob Woodward,

821
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:35,610
he writes a book called fear and he,

822
00:45:35,611 --> 00:45:40,530
he uses quotes secondhand from
anonymous sources on background,

823
00:45:40,531 --> 00:45:42,660
on deep background,
hearsay quotes,

824
00:45:43,050 --> 00:45:47,760
and then he recreates events and he puts
that, those events in quotation marks.

825
00:45:48,210 --> 00:45:50,190
And I get attacked for selective editing.

826
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:53,940
I don't report anything unless you can
hear and see it come out of the person's

827
00:45:53,941 --> 00:45:55,920
own mouth.
So I think that,

828
00:45:56,010 --> 00:46:01,010
I think that journalism has become
corrupted due to this overreliance upon

829
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:04,200
sources,
anonymous sources especially.

830
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:07,080
And I think that that's
why we need videotapes.

831
00:46:07,290 --> 00:46:11,850
I literally remember being in like junior
high school and watching CNN and they

832
00:46:11,851 --> 00:46:13,920
would say a source on Capitol Hill.

833
00:46:14,370 --> 00:46:18,360
And I would always think this is the
same source I Capitola anyone can be on

834
00:46:18,361 --> 00:46:18,901
Capitol Hill.

835
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:22,380
It could be the guy that's walking his
dog on Capitol Hill who is the janitor

836
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:26,030
for the, you know, fast food joint.
We don't, we don't see, we don't,

837
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:30,330
we don't see that sources face.
We don't know what motivates that person.

838
00:46:30,331 --> 00:46:33,180
We don't know what words were used.
You know that that person exists.

839
00:46:33,210 --> 00:46:34,890
We don't know if that person exists.
I mean,

840
00:46:34,891 --> 00:46:39,870
can you imagine if I said
there are sources inside CNN
who says that Jeff Zucker

841
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:44,340
said they'd call me a liar. Yeah, and,
and, and I, and there's an analogy here.

842
00:46:44,341 --> 00:46:46,590
I heard someone say that when
you use an anonymous source,

843
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:51,060
it's like you're taking withdrawal
out of a bank account of credibility,

844
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:56,160
but you have to deposit into the bank
account, trust with the audience.

845
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:58,950
And nowadays we don't see these,

846
00:46:59,310 --> 00:47:04,310
we don't see these anonymous sources we
see on an over reliance upon and every

847
00:47:04,501 --> 00:47:06,360
time you actually opened
the reporter's notebook,

848
00:47:06,361 --> 00:47:10,820
every time you look at the transcript,
every time you see the raw data there,

849
00:47:10,830 --> 00:47:11,663
there is a,

850
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:16,800
there is a difference between what you
are told and and by the people that are

851
00:47:16,801 --> 00:47:21,420
asking you to trust them. But that's
the bottom line. These, these,

852
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:25,770
these media companies don't trust
us with the raw information.

853
00:47:25,771 --> 00:47:28,770
They don't want us to have the raw,
unfiltered truth.

854
00:47:29,230 --> 00:47:32,060
They need to propagandize
us with their version of it.

855
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:36,210
Yeah, it's crazy once you see it, right,
like once you really clearly see it.

856
00:47:36,211 --> 00:47:40,620
Like I was actually in the green room
with Jordan Peterson while he was being

857
00:47:40,621 --> 00:47:42,780
interviewed by Nellie Bowles,

858
00:47:42,781 --> 00:47:45,720
who was the author of the New York
Times who made that whole brouhaha about

859
00:47:45,721 --> 00:47:50,700
enforced monogamy and it's like that is
not what this conversation was about.

860
00:47:50,820 --> 00:47:52,620
Or I had a whole day here,

861
00:47:52,770 --> 00:47:57,150
literally an entire day from 8:00 AM
to about APM with a journalist from a

862
00:47:57,151 --> 00:47:57,984
journalist,

863
00:47:58,050 --> 00:48:03,050
from a Durer Spiegel who then wrote a
piece about me and labeled me the grand

864
00:48:03,241 --> 00:48:05,160
illusionist of the alt right.

865
00:48:05,390 --> 00:48:07,560
And it's like they're labeled
and you know what they did.

866
00:48:07,590 --> 00:48:08,790
There's a light and know this at the time,

867
00:48:08,791 --> 00:48:11,130
but there's a law in Germany that
if you're going to print something,

868
00:48:11,131 --> 00:48:13,440
a quote from somebody,
you have to get the quote cleared.

869
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:17,130
So he spends all day with me, hours
of talking hours and hours and hours.

870
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:18,120
He doesn't quote me one.

871
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:21,810
Wow. I mean that's the level that, what
is that? It's not selective editing.

872
00:48:22,170 --> 00:48:24,840
They called me the master of
ceremonies instead of an anchor.

873
00:48:24,841 --> 00:48:26,610
They used the master of ceremonies.

874
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:28,380
I mean it just like what
the Washington Post Guy,

875
00:48:28,490 --> 00:48:30,490
there's no sounds like grand masters.
The Washington Post,

876
00:48:30,491 --> 00:48:33,810
this printed like five attractions
just in reporting about me.

877
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:37,620
It's like these guys have the
audacity to claim that I'm a liar.

878
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:42,660
In one article they said what the latest
project Veritas video leaves out and

879
00:48:42,661 --> 00:48:47,661
the actual fact that I allegedly left
out was that this CNN producer that we

880
00:48:47,731 --> 00:48:51,510
recorded was based in Atlanta.
Supposedly this was a big fat,

881
00:48:51,750 --> 00:48:53,850
but I didn't leave it out.
It was in the video.

882
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:57,900
The Washington Post had
to print a retraction that
that they didn't change the

883
00:48:57,901 --> 00:49:01,980
headline. What the what the video left
out. They retracted the entire thing.

884
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:05,610
There's another thing in the Washington
Post about this book fear and there was

885
00:49:05,611 --> 00:49:06,444
a quote that said,

886
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:11,220
there's no evidence that he did not
say the things attributed to him in

887
00:49:11,221 --> 00:49:15,330
referencing. There's no evidence he did
not sell. That's really good. This is,

888
00:49:15,770 --> 00:49:20,220
we live in this weird world and I think
that videotape cuts through all the

889
00:49:20,221 --> 00:49:22,350
propaganda,
like a hot knife through butter.

890
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:26,910
If you catch these people on videotape,
they're forced to address it.

891
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:30,750
And I think that video is, is, that's
why we choose the medium of video,

892
00:49:30,751 --> 00:49:34,980
because words, words do not
transfix in a way that video does.

893
00:49:34,981 --> 00:49:36,570
And I think that words are the,

894
00:49:36,990 --> 00:49:40,830
frankly the propagandists tool because
they put you in a box by calling you

895
00:49:40,831 --> 00:49:41,790
names like that.

896
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:45,060
My calling the masters of ceremonies
by calling you what you were,

897
00:49:45,061 --> 00:49:47,310
you're not what that is. You are. You

898
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:49,470
got it. I know we could trade
these stories all day long.

899
00:49:49,471 --> 00:49:52,100
I'll just give you one more. But that
same reporter from New York Times,

900
00:49:52,110 --> 00:49:56,070
Nellie Bowles, she wrote the story
when Peterson and I left Patrion,

901
00:49:56,071 --> 00:49:58,230
they actually did a story on it,
which was quite shocking.

902
00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:01,230
It's a horrible story filled with
factual errors. But in there,

903
00:50:01,231 --> 00:50:05,430
there's a quote from the head of trust
and safety at patrion where she says,

904
00:50:05,610 --> 00:50:05,821
you know,

905
00:50:05,821 --> 00:50:09,990
you're not allowed to say these words on
our platform except so as I'm sure you

906
00:50:09,991 --> 00:50:13,590
know Carl Benjamin, so going to like
never said those words on their platform.

907
00:50:13,591 --> 00:50:16,710
I contacted the author and it's like she
just doesn't care and she knows she's

908
00:50:16,711 --> 00:50:19,410
not going to get fired and why
even tell the truth. So it's like

909
00:50:19,410 --> 00:50:19,520
they,

910
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:23,010
they just don't want to on that people
are doing and more frequency is recording

911
00:50:23,011 --> 00:50:25,260
their interviews with
these people that we,

912
00:50:25,410 --> 00:50:28,100
and that's something that I would
encourage as long it's legal to do so.

913
00:50:28,310 --> 00:50:30,500
But you're on the record. So it's, it's,

914
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:34,310
it's legal because they're consenting to
the conversation even in, in California.

915
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:39,020
And we had one individual inside
CNN record, Alison Camera,

916
00:50:39,021 --> 00:50:43,550
she does a long panel discussion about
voter fraud that cut the tape right

917
00:50:43,551 --> 00:50:46,370
before the guy actually
brought up instances.

918
00:50:46,371 --> 00:50:48,440
So something that people are doing now,

919
00:50:48,441 --> 00:50:52,850
is there audio recording these interviews
for that reason and releasing the full

920
00:50:52,851 --> 00:50:54,260
interview on Youtube?
Right.

921
00:50:54,261 --> 00:50:57,560
So we've seen a lot of that actually
Tommy Robinson has done that. This guy,

922
00:50:57,561 --> 00:51:01,220
Avi Yemeni has done that with a yes,
this Jim Jack. I would not, I would,

923
00:51:01,221 --> 00:51:02,240
I would employ your audience,

924
00:51:02,241 --> 00:51:07,241
never do an interview with the press
unless you audio tape it and that's for

925
00:51:08,061 --> 00:51:12,020
your own, um, for your own protection
for sure. The other thing you can do,

926
00:51:12,021 --> 00:51:15,800
at least in our situation is I
really only do these shows now.

927
00:51:15,860 --> 00:51:19,040
If it's live right, if it's
alive, you can't edit me.

928
00:51:19,070 --> 00:51:22,200
You might be able to sandbag me
and I have to be smart enough to,

929
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:26,210
to work with that. But you at least can
edit me. So Andrew Breitbart was my,

930
00:51:26,211 --> 00:51:28,940
one of my mentors and he would take
this very, we were different people,

931
00:51:28,941 --> 00:51:32,570
but he would take this perspective of,
you know, just as much press as possible.

932
00:51:32,571 --> 00:51:36,920
I'm proudly who I am. I guess it
was a different world 10 years ago,

933
00:51:36,921 --> 00:51:40,250
but he would do, he would
just give them everything. Um,

934
00:51:40,251 --> 00:51:42,410
I think that there's two
different ways to play it,

935
00:51:42,411 --> 00:51:46,700
but we certainly to record the
interviews is a good, a good path.

936
00:51:46,701 --> 00:51:50,300
And some people are leaking us these
audio tapes and we put the, we put the,

937
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:55,460
the long version out on Twitter and Alison
Camerata at CNN was so humiliated by

938
00:51:55,611 --> 00:51:58,900
this raw version of the interview
that she actually removed she,

939
00:51:58,901 --> 00:52:03,410
she left Twitter because
people were tweeting at her.
All the while all this, uh,

940
00:52:03,411 --> 00:52:06,980
all these angry tweets. So we talked
a little bit about anonymous sources.

941
00:52:06,981 --> 00:52:11,000
What do you make of just
like the anonymous accounts
all over the platforms that

942
00:52:11,030 --> 00:52:14,990
often are the drivers of a lot of
the bad behavior. So for example,

943
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:17,300
there are anonymous accounts that have 20,
30,

944
00:52:17,390 --> 00:52:20,030
40,000 followers that I see all day long.

945
00:52:20,031 --> 00:52:23,300
Selectively editing video clips
of me or just any, you know,

946
00:52:23,330 --> 00:52:24,710
any decent human being.

947
00:52:25,010 --> 00:52:27,950
And it's like they can do it with complete
impunity because their names aren't

948
00:52:27,951 --> 00:52:30,980
attached to any of this. And what,
what are you going to do? What,

949
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:32,840
what do we do in situation? I mean, I,

950
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:36,680
I've got people impersonating
me and I'm not verified.

951
00:52:36,681 --> 00:52:40,280
I got 500,000 followers that this morning.
I don't know who else.

952
00:52:40,310 --> 00:52:43,790
I guess there's Julian Assan.
She's also not verified. Um,

953
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:45,710
I don't know how to solve these problems.

954
00:52:45,710 --> 00:52:48,380
I don't know what the public
policy solutions are. My,

955
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:50,720
my perspective and I never want
to ask me what do we do about it.

956
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:53,750
I say the solution is
to inform the people.

957
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:57,290
The solution is to show people
the rot, the corruption, to,

958
00:52:57,291 --> 00:53:01,820
to rake the muck as it were, to be a
muckraker to illuminate all the problems.

959
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:05,810
Because I think the solutions become self
evident when people know that there's

960
00:53:05,811 --> 00:53:09,710
a guy in a room in San Francisco
arbitrarily determined, oh,

961
00:53:09,711 --> 00:53:12,170
we're going to take away,
not take away the blue check mark.

962
00:53:12,171 --> 00:53:17,171
We don't like that guy's politics film
that show people those conversations

963
00:53:17,181 --> 00:53:21,540
behind closed doors because then they
can't get, there is impunity. They,

964
00:53:21,670 --> 00:53:25,680
they can't get away with it. And
that's the, that is solution.

965
00:53:25,890 --> 00:53:30,390
The solution is to expose it. Um,
what, I mean, I can't believe that I'm,

966
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:31,040
I mean,

967
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:34,080
on one hand I don't want to complain
about it because it makes it me feel like

968
00:53:34,081 --> 00:53:37,460
I'm, you know, ingratiating
myself to Twitter. I'm not,

969
00:53:37,470 --> 00:53:41,850
I'm not a verified human being
on the platform. And I and and,

970
00:53:41,910 --> 00:53:45,540
and why not? What is the
definition of of being verified,

971
00:53:45,541 --> 00:53:49,320
but certainly when you are verified, it
does help your, your stories get out.

972
00:53:49,321 --> 00:53:53,310
It does. People know that it's actually
you and know you've had people,

973
00:53:53,370 --> 00:53:56,970
many people in person. Amy, I don't,
I don't know what the solution is,

974
00:53:56,971 --> 00:54:01,440
but I know that to find the solution we
have to properly identify the problem

975
00:54:01,441 --> 00:54:02,880
and educate the people
with what they're saying.

976
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:06,720
You need a mole in the verified
department who can just click that button.

977
00:54:06,721 --> 00:54:10,080
Maybe we already have one. Ah. It's still
always question is whether to cut bait.

978
00:54:10,230 --> 00:54:10,831
If you will be,

979
00:54:10,831 --> 00:54:14,010
if you will be verified with your blue
check by the time this video goes up,

980
00:54:14,011 --> 00:54:17,910
I will be very impressed. That would be
amazing. That'll be interesting somehow.

981
00:54:17,910 --> 00:54:20,400
I think you haven't been
sitting on that one. No, I I,

982
00:54:20,401 --> 00:54:23,130
well the question with undercover
work is when do you cut bait?

983
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:27,300
Because you have these people who are in
on the inside and then you have to make

984
00:54:27,301 --> 00:54:29,580
an editorial decision on
when do we release the story.

985
00:54:29,581 --> 00:54:30,720
Like we have people right now,

986
00:54:30,750 --> 00:54:35,640
right now as I speak inside the
big networks who work for them,

987
00:54:36,450 --> 00:54:41,450
they come to me and they are so sick by
how these companies project themselves.

988
00:54:42,601 --> 00:54:46,290
You know, all the news that's fit to
print, the most trusted name in news.

989
00:54:46,590 --> 00:54:51,180
That is not what they hear in, in
the newsrooms. They here, they,

990
00:54:51,181 --> 00:54:53,280
I mean we had one person
say that people were crying,

991
00:54:53,340 --> 00:54:56,610
they were crying the night of the
election at the Washington Post.

992
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:01,950
Everyone was sobbing and the things that
were being said that night would shock

993
00:55:01,951 --> 00:55:04,350
you.
So these people come to me,

994
00:55:04,620 --> 00:55:09,270
we're calling it the be brave initiative
and we think that the heroes are,

995
00:55:09,271 --> 00:55:13,740
these are these individuals on the
inside and I think that they'll blow the

996
00:55:13,741 --> 00:55:15,510
whistle, they'll tape them. That works.

997
00:55:15,511 --> 00:55:19,980
And hopefully that that will change
people's perception of big media once and

998
00:55:19,981 --> 00:55:24,030
for all. How do you think a
Trump somehow understood this?

999
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:29,720
How is it that this orange man with crazy
hair somehow understood that like this

1000
00:55:31,741 --> 00:55:33,170
wasn't like he was, oh he, you know,

1001
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:35,250
he was always sort of a
Twitter troll and yeah,

1002
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:38,100
doing his thing and he understood the
celebrity and he understood public

1003
00:55:38,101 --> 00:55:39,840
relations and business obviously.

1004
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:42,540
But this very specific thing that
we've been talking about for,

1005
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:46,230
for the last hour,
Trump really seems to understand this.

1006
00:55:46,231 --> 00:55:48,150
Do you have any sense of what that is?

1007
00:55:48,151 --> 00:55:52,010
My perspective is that it was about earned
media that was about generating are,

1008
00:55:52,011 --> 00:55:54,740
and I think that there was some
something written about this where he,

1009
00:55:54,770 --> 00:55:58,320
his advisors said, you can't run
this campaign on earned media alone.

1010
00:55:58,350 --> 00:56:01,140
You have to be more traditional.
I said, the Hell I can't watch me.

1011
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:04,950
And he got some, I don't know how much it
was, five, $10 billion in earned media.

1012
00:56:04,951 --> 00:56:08,670
Yeah. It's this, it's this notion
of, I think a lot of people,

1013
00:56:08,671 --> 00:56:10,740
particularly on the conservative
side of the spectrum,

1014
00:56:11,010 --> 00:56:15,920
tend to complain about wine, about, you
know, the mainstream media. They, they,

1015
00:56:15,921 --> 00:56:20,610
they, I call it the conservative ghetto.
They stay talking to themselves. But,

1016
00:56:21,030 --> 00:56:23,810
but then there's this other vision
where you, where are you? You,

1017
00:56:23,830 --> 00:56:27,340
you hack the media, you, you
participate in the media. It's again,

1018
00:56:27,341 --> 00:56:30,550
going back to Andrew Breitbart,
he would, he would, um, uh,

1019
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:35,600
love to go on these shows
that the definition of success
is being covered by the

1020
00:56:35,621 --> 00:56:39,940
mainstream media in it's, it's a, it's
a tough dance because they attack you,

1021
00:56:39,941 --> 00:56:43,120
they call you and Julie, you know,
Jordan names and those sorts of things.

1022
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:46,390
But if you play it the right way
and he covered by the media, that's,

1023
00:56:46,420 --> 00:56:47,350
that's real power.

1024
00:56:47,351 --> 00:56:52,351
And Trump understood that he could
win the election with earned media.

1025
00:56:52,391 --> 00:56:56,410
It was absolutely brilliant. Nobody else
saw it. Everyone thought he was nuts.

1026
00:56:56,770 --> 00:57:01,720
But he won the election on earned
media, on getting these big ABC, CBS,

1027
00:57:01,721 --> 00:57:05,920
NBC New York Times to, to cover him,
to talk about him. It was brilliant.

1028
00:57:06,220 --> 00:57:08,500
It was amazing. And everyone thought
he couldn't, it couldn't be done.

1029
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:11,290
And he did it. And I, and by
the way, I have the same vision,

1030
00:57:11,350 --> 00:57:14,560
although in a lesser degree,

1031
00:57:15,010 --> 00:57:16,660
I tell my team,

1032
00:57:16,661 --> 00:57:20,320
I tell my employees the definition of
success is to get on the front page of the

1033
00:57:20,321 --> 00:57:23,010
New York Times because it
Manhattan, what, what you, you know,

1034
00:57:23,050 --> 00:57:25,270
people have to realize is that if
it is not in the New York Times,

1035
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:26,830
it does not exist.

1036
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:31,330
They don't pay attention
to things on the outside.

1037
00:57:31,570 --> 00:57:36,480
I hate to give them that power, but it's
still true to a degree. Yeah. So to,

1038
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:40,540
to be successful is to be covered
by the people that we hate.

1039
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:42,190
And also,

1040
00:57:42,790 --> 00:57:47,410
and also not to get stuck where we
want to be loved by those people. Yes.

1041
00:57:47,580 --> 00:57:50,170
But because that's the problem
that that is, that is the problem.

1042
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:53,130
We want to be loved. And Rush
Limbaugh says, you know, I,

1043
00:57:53,131 --> 00:57:57,550
I learned that to be hated
as a sign of success.

1044
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:01,570
And that's where a lot of Republicans
go wrong. Trump did not go wrong.

1045
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:06,040
A lot of Republicans want to be loved
by the New York Times, by politico.

1046
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:10,540
Um, it's tempting. I want to be loved
you. Everyone wants to be loved, right?

1047
00:58:10,690 --> 00:58:15,050
But we're going to be hated for what
we say and do. So it's being co,

1048
00:58:15,070 --> 00:58:18,750
so Trump's getting covered by them, but
he also calls them fake news. Right.

1049
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:22,180
Brilliant. Yeah, it's, it's,
it's Andrew Breitbart 2.0

1050
00:58:22,770 --> 00:58:26,460
all right. So in, in
summation here, if you had to,

1051
00:58:26,970 --> 00:58:30,900
if you were in the predictions game,
where do you see the platforms?

1052
00:58:31,290 --> 00:58:36,060
Do you sense that the way we communicate
right now where we're all on these

1053
00:58:36,061 --> 00:58:41,061
things and we're all subjected to these
subjective rules and seemingly arbitrary

1054
00:58:42,570 --> 00:58:45,930
decisions and all of those things,
do you sense that five,

1055
00:58:45,931 --> 00:58:49,050
10 years from now it's going to still
be the same or do you think that things

1056
00:58:49,051 --> 00:58:50,160
are going to massively change?

1057
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:55,150
They are only going to change
if independent citizens
have the courage and the

1058
00:58:55,151 --> 00:58:58,930
willpower to do something about it?
I don't trust the politicians.

1059
00:58:59,140 --> 00:59:02,440
I don't trust the people on television
to do anything about it because they're

1060
00:59:02,441 --> 00:59:05,380
stuck in the status quo
and they're fat and happy.

1061
00:59:05,650 --> 00:59:08,380
It's going to require citizens,
independent people. You know,

1062
00:59:08,381 --> 00:59:11,590
some of these insiders,
I know some of them and others,

1063
00:59:12,070 --> 00:59:16,540
they have to blow the whistle. They have
to summon the righteous indignation.

1064
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:21,010
I think that journalism has the
power to change hearts and minds,

1065
00:59:21,020 --> 00:59:25,670
real investigative reporting,
uh, to, to be the, uh,

1066
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:28,250
what has been called the
custodians of conscience.

1067
00:59:28,610 --> 00:59:30,260
And if we can shock the people,

1068
00:59:30,261 --> 00:59:33,980
show them what's going on
behind the closed doors, I
think it can change things.

1069
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:37,760
If that does not happen,
I think we'll enter a brave new world.

1070
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:41,080
Where does it happen? Where a long
gun, right? Yeah, but, but, but, but,

1071
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:43,730
but there are people, I know these
people, they're going to blow the whistle.

1072
00:59:43,731 --> 00:59:47,720
But if that does not happen, then
we're going to enter a brave new world.

1073
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:52,220
But where the story has to be so big,
here's the silver lining.

1074
00:59:52,670 --> 00:59:55,130
Even if we get banned,
even if you get banned and I get band,

1075
00:59:55,131 --> 00:59:56,000
everyone gets banned,

1076
00:59:56,690 --> 01:00:00,620
the stories will come out and other
people will share them proxies.

1077
01:00:00,621 --> 01:00:03,390
We'll share them and they will
share the information that,

1078
01:00:03,391 --> 01:00:06,920
that people will have a right
to know that we'll want to see.

1079
01:00:07,340 --> 01:00:10,370
But I think it's going
to require an effort by,

1080
01:00:10,460 --> 01:00:14,690
by independent citizens and brave
patriots willing to blow the whistle.

1081
01:00:14,691 --> 01:00:19,120
That is the only saving grace I
can see for this country. Uh, the,

1082
01:00:19,121 --> 01:00:23,030
the heroes amongst us that they
can, uh, to pitch a little bit.

1083
01:00:23,031 --> 01:00:25,580
They can go to our website
and I will give them a camera.

1084
01:00:25,581 --> 01:00:26,720
I will pay their legal bills,

1085
01:00:26,721 --> 01:00:30,560
I will hire them if they
are fired by their employer.

1086
01:00:30,590 --> 01:00:32,930
Twitter and Facebook have not sued me.
I get sued a lot.

1087
01:00:33,140 --> 01:00:34,940
I have not been sued by those companies.

1088
01:00:35,270 --> 01:00:40,270
They do not want to give heft and weight
to the stories that we have unmasked.

1089
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:44,550
They do not want to give us free
publicity. So there is a, uh,

1090
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:47,750
a strategy here to,
to hold these people accountable.

1091
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:49,100
I'm going to ask you one more actually,

1092
01:00:49,101 --> 01:00:53,000
which is I've asked this of a few of my
guests that I think are on the forefront

1093
01:00:53,030 --> 01:00:58,030
of saying on popular things are doing
work that is challenging and interesting

1094
01:00:58,071 --> 01:01:00,820
way. What is it about you? Why? Why,

1095
01:01:00,830 --> 01:01:03,950
why do you James O'keefe
put your ass on the line.

1096
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:07,840
If I, if, if very tasks went away
tomorrow and I had no employees,

1097
01:01:07,841 --> 01:01:11,860
I'd be out hustling on the street
with a cam quarter and this is I,

1098
01:01:11,861 --> 01:01:14,470
this is what I was born to do,
like I can't do anything else.

1099
01:01:14,740 --> 01:01:17,440
And it goes back to this whole
idea of a justice complex,

1100
01:01:17,650 --> 01:01:21,010
like the acorn investigation
that cost me $1,000 to do.

1101
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:22,930
I borrowed my grandmother's
Chinchilla coat,

1102
01:01:23,260 --> 01:01:27,810
a camcorder that a friend gave me an a
borrowed copy of final cut pro and acorn

1103
01:01:27,820 --> 01:01:30,610
was defunded. Both houses of Congress
are democratically controlled.

1104
01:01:30,611 --> 01:01:34,030
President Obama signed the bill.
It doesn't take money to do this.

1105
01:01:34,420 --> 01:01:39,070
It doesn't take power to do
this. It takes, it takes will.

1106
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:42,370
It takes the design.
It takes a belief in justice.

1107
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:44,230
It takes a desire to,

1108
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:48,550
to expose something to inform your fellow
citizens and finding people who are

1109
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:51,100
likeminded.
If they were to take away my organization,

1110
01:01:51,101 --> 01:01:52,270
I'd be doing this for the rest of my life.

1111
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:54,820
I had nothing else I could
do because I believe in it.

1112
01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:58,920
I actually believe in what I'm doing
and the people that I find I have,

1113
01:01:58,930 --> 01:02:03,010
I have a profound responsibility
to serve the, the people,

1114
01:02:03,011 --> 01:02:07,180
to tell the truth to the people and people
coming forward that want to blow the

1115
01:02:07,181 --> 01:02:10,480
whistle. This is, this is
why Veritas now exists,

1116
01:02:10,481 --> 01:02:14,230
is to equip those people
and to protect them.

1117
01:02:14,470 --> 01:02:17,650
I'd be willing to go to jail to
protect a source. I have been to jail.

1118
01:02:17,651 --> 01:02:21,570
I've been incarcerated, I've been
sued. I've been set up. It's not,

1119
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:22,620
it's not the worst thing.

1120
01:02:22,621 --> 01:02:27,540
The worst thing is not to to serve the
people that come to me and want to tell a

1121
01:02:27,541 --> 01:02:28,080
story,

1122
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:32,730
and that's why we exist and we're
going to keep doing it until people are
