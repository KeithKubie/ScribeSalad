00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:06.340
It's also worth bearing in mind what this course is not about. The course is not

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:08.790
an introduction to networking, so there are a

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.300
number of basic topics that won't be covered in

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.060
this course. In particular, we'll assume that you're

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:19.270
already familiar with the basics of things like TCP,

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.710
Socket programming, and so forth. Anything that you

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.150
might have picked up in an introductory networking course.

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:27.820
We are just going to assume as a

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.800
prerequisite for this course. So before you proceed,

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.930
it may be worth revisiting some of

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.970
your old undergraduate networking course material. The course

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.630
is also not providing any introduction to

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:43.650
programming. However, many assignments in the course will

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:47.210
make use of some amount of programming. So,

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.600
some knowledge of scripting languages like Ruby, Python

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.040
or Perl will certainly be helpful in some assignments.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.320
We'll be making a lot of use of a

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.750
network emulation toolkit called Mininet and to use that

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.330
tool most effectively, You will certainly want to learn

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.110
some Python if you don't already know it. Don't

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.690
worry if you don't know these languages already though.

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.460
There's plenty of time to learn, in the course.

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.671
Since the deadlines are fairly spread out, and the assignments

00:01:16.671 --> 00:01:20.740
aren't focused on knowledge of programming per say. But rather, the

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.520
concepts that you are going to realize in the programming languages.
