00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Now, compare the level of diagnostic output we've seen in C and C++

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
with the amount of diagnostic output you get in Python.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
If you write assert 2+2=5 as condition that evaluates the form.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
So which information does one get from a failing Python assertion.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Do you get the failing assertion condition. In our case, 2+2=5.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
The location of the assertion in the program. In our case, line 1.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
The location of the defect in the code or the list of callers. Try it out for yourself, over to you.
