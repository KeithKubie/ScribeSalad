00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:01.411
MALE SPEAKER: Let's roll.

00:00:01.411 --> 00:00:03.860
All right, A-camera
speeds, D-speeds.

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:06.760
FEMALE SPEAKER: #Love4Dev,
scene seven, take one, ABC,

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:07.305
come to mark.

00:00:07.305 --> 00:00:08.680
MALE SPEAKER: So
the thing I love

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.250
most about being a developer
is that I get to actually solve

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.469
real world problems.

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:14.510
And I can do it without
kind of any special tool.

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:17.014
So I can just open
up a text editor,

00:00:17.014 --> 00:00:18.930
put my code in, and then
start to actually see

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.263
the problem kind of being
solved in front of me as I go.

00:00:21.263 --> 00:00:24.550
MALE SPEAKER: What I enjoy
the most is the bleeding edge,

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.531
the speed at which we
deliver new technologies.

00:00:27.531 --> 00:00:29.530
MALE SPEAKER: Our community
is based on sharing,

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:30.760
that we do open source.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.920
And by a kind of passing
our work back and forth,

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:34.850
we all get better.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:36.780
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:00:41.175 --> 00:00:42.550
MALE SPEAKER:
Having every client

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.640
be connected to
the web at any time

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.332
is both a blessing and a curse.

00:00:47.332 --> 00:00:49.540
FEMALE SPEAKER: The biggest
challenge developers face

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.780
is there is so much
information, there

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.990
are so many different tools,
technologies, and resources

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:56.470
for them to choose from.

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:58.540
And they're not always
the easiest to find.

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.120
MALE SPEAKER: Things
used to be a lot simpler.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.161
We used to write code,
and we used to compile it.

00:01:02.161 --> 00:01:03.810
And then we would be done.

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:05.489
Now we've got the
web to worry about.

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.090
We've got mobile to worry about.

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:08.670
And then on each
of these platforms,

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:09.629
there's separate tools.

00:01:09.629 --> 00:01:11.086
MALE SPEAKER: Some
days you're just

00:01:11.086 --> 00:01:12.790
like, I just want
to build, and I

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.820
don't want to kind of
bridge all these gaps.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.278
MALE SPEAKER: Even if you stay
on top with all the releases

00:01:17.278 --> 00:01:19.870
and all the API changes,
trying to figure out,

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.940
how would a developer
use this to provide value

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.492
to users out there,
that is also stressful.

00:01:25.492 --> 00:01:27.700
MALE SPEAKER: What I really
hope we see over the next

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.330
maybe five years is
that people get access

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.910
to good connectivity,
cheaper data.

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:34.869
Through that, they get
access to the whole web.

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:37.076
FEMALE SPEAKER: There are
millions more people coming

00:01:37.076 --> 00:01:38.610
on line throughout the world.

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.320
And for developers, it presents
a huge opportunity, not just

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.610
to expand, but to
think about how

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.860
to build custom experiences
that match the unique needs

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.140
of those new markets.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.640
MALE SPEAKER: If
we're going to have

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.600
the same pace of innovation,
there are no signs

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:53.820
that it's going to slow down.

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.210
It's going to be a really,
really exciting future

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.750
out there.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.499
MALE SPEAKER: There's
so much opportunity,

00:01:58.499 --> 00:02:01.400
and you see so many unexpected
things every single day.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.240
MALE SPEAKER: We connect
to everyone on the planet.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.750
And that, to me,
is just amazing.
