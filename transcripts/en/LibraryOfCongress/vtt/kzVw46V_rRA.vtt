00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.510
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:24.520
[ Silence ]

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:25.820
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Good evening.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.350
I'm Anne McLean from the
Library's concert office.

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:29.870
With this talk, I'm delighted

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:33.330
to be officially opening the
90th anniversary celebration

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.670
of the Library's concert series.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.830
We're celebrating nine
decades of splendid concerts,

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:41.010
a long and storied legacy.

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.270
Coming up, a terrific and
very exciting 90 weeks

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.820
of celebration starting tonight.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.660
We have a stunning
line-up of concerts

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.780
and events reflecting our
past, and we're looking ahead

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.860
to a very strong and
exhilarating future.

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.930
As insiders and good
friends, you're the first

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.510
to get a mini sneak
preview of our celebration

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.790
which will continue
through September 2016.

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.750
We have quite a lot to celebrate
including the three jewels

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.050
of our series.

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.710
Which are the superb
auditorium, our rare instruments,

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.660
and the vast expanse of the
music division's collections.

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.270
Nearly 22 million items.

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.540
More than 500 commissions including
landmark works by Maurice Ravel,

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.690
Bayla [phonetic] Bartaugh,
Arnold Schoenberg,

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.170 position:56%
Aaron Copeland, and many, many more.

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.480
Warm relationships, a theme of
this talk, and a huge roster

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.790
of towering musical figures
from several generations.

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.130
Plus, a very sophisticated audience

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.320
which plays an important
role in our history.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.190
Among the world's national
libraries,

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.860
we are unique in being
a major presenter.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.240
As the nation's oldest
federal cultural institution,

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.880
the Library is also an
important actor in the realm

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.500
of cultural diplomacy,

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.110
and our concerts very
much reflect this mission.

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.400
Opus 90 seemed an appropriate
title for this talk

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.600
because our founder Elizabeth
Sprague Coolidge called her work

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:03.900
here the creation

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.630
of this extraordinary
series, her Magnum Opus.

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.920
It is a great work that is
still very much ongoing,

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.640
evolving as our culture evolves.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.650
And it has continued to be
a great and absorbing work

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.480 position:56%
for the many people fortunate enough
to have helped it live so vibrantly

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.970
since its founding
almost 90 years ago.

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.880
Throughout our history,

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.940
the programming has been
informed by some constants.

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.900
The intention to present concerts
of the highest artistic caliber,

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.430
the ideal of uncompromising
integrity,

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.360
and the goals of diversity
and democratic outreach.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.170
Here are some of the questions
that we'll look into in this hour.

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.640
How did the Library of
Congress come to be the owner

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.770
and operator of a concert series?

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.200 position:56%
How have we effected the development

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.290
and appreciation of
music in America?

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.760
First in classical music
and later a range of genres?

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.230
What's the story of the
concerts as a media presence?

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.980
And, finally, how does
the visionary thinking

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.830
of our predecessors inform
our strategic planning

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.960
for the future while we press
forward in new directions?

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.610
To answer these questions, we
naturally begin with Mrs. Coolidge.

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.700
A formidable lady of great
imagination, passion, intelligence,

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.710
and tremendous energy whose 150th
birthday we celebrate this season.

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:32.270
This is an image with an early
image of her around 1902.

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:36.400 position:56%
Still with the dramatic big hats and
if you can see the whole picture,

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.870
a long bustle and everything.

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.070
As you'll see when we go
forward from this background,

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:45.650
she became a very,
very modern woman.

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:51.630
One that is still a
remarkable inspiration today.

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:59.090
Her concept, in 1925, she
endowed the Library of Congress

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:03.240
with our superb concert hall
and endowed a foundation

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.710
to support a free chamber
music series.

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:11.200 position:56%
Her gift was a groundbreaking public
private partnership requiring an act

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.150
of Congress.

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.140
This concept was radical.

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.220
It was one that would
bring the nation's library

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.660
to international visibility
as a presenter

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.450
and establish a precedent
for future benefactors.

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:26.120
It would raise the awareness
of chamber music in America

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.860
and ensure her legacy as one of the
great music patrons of her time.

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.700
She was a fine pianist
who loved chamber music.

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.630
You see her in this grainy
image here with her son, Albert.

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.680
She was a lifelong
student of composition

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.040
and published some pieces.

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.460
She had one piece published
by G Shermer.

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.190
That work which was a set of Mother
Goose songs was also recorded,

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:54.080
and you can see in here a
Victor [inaudible] of that.

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.390
She wrote a string quartet
and an oboe and piano sonata,

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:01.490
a number of pieces which we have
here and have had played through

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:03.740
and one has been performed.

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:07.100
Had Mrs. Coolidge been from a
different social background,

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:10.310
she very likely would have
been a professional musician.

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:14.200
She would become a sophisticated
presenter, a true impresario

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:17.460
with excellent taste and
the highest standards.

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:22.080
On her arrival in Washington,
she was at 60 already well known

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.950
as the founder of the
Berkshire Festival and had begun

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:27.480
to commission a roster of
compositions that would help

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.790
to shape the history
of 20th century music.

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:34.300
Mrs. Coolidge would
build four concert halls.

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.230
This is her temple of music at
South Mountain in the Berkshires

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:39.100
in Pittsfield, Massachusetts.

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:42.030
She also funded and built
ooze well as the Coolidge,

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:46.610
the Sprague Music Hall at Yale
and the hall at Mills College.

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:50.160
Here she is with her very good
friends, the composer Frank Bridge

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.280
and his wife in Pittsfield.

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:57.560
I couldn't resist this picture
of the Neptune Plaza here

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:02.440
at the Library to place us visually
here in Washington around 1920.

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:05.480
Coming to Washington
and creating a new home

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:09.270 position:56%
for her chamber music festivals here
was a daunting challenge requiring

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:12.860
all her experience and the
help of two important partners.

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:15.510
The Librarian of Congress
Herbert Putnam

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:18.840 position:56%
and Music Division Chief Carl Engel.

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:23.250
Putnam was the first
professional Librarian of Congress

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:25.440
and also he was an attorney.

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:28.900
He was from the Putnam
publishing family.

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:31.890
Carl Engel, much younger,
born in Paris,

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:34.700
and educated in Germany
was multilingual,

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:37.030
cultivated, and very smart.

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:40.750 position:56%
He had a strong scholarly background
imminently suited to his career

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:42.530
in a discipline that's
recently begun

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:46.190
to be known as public musicology.

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:49.900
This is an image of Carl Engel
with the composer Ernst Bloch.

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:52.220
And the little cartoon
next to it is interesting.

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:54.450
It shows, it gives you
a sense of something

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:56.660
of the relationship he
had with Mrs. Coolidge.

00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:00.910
It refers to the Michelin Tires.

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:03.810
And the little figure on
the left is called Michel

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:06.500
and the woman's figure is Lean.

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:11.230
And it has to do with the pneumatic
tires which keep on going and,

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:15.220
you know, last forever,
durable, powerful, and so on.

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:20.310
And there were a lot of inside
jokes between the two of them.

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:22.060
Their letters are fascinating.

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:24.330
And if you read her
biography by Cyrilla Barr,

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:28.110
you really will be engaged.

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:30.910
Engel's warm relationship
with Mrs. Coolidge was based

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:33.670
on deep respect, mutual respect.

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:36.960
They set the artistic bar
very high from the beginning,

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:40.740
choosing both European and
American composers and performers

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:43.650
with Mrs. Coolidge
favoring the former.

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:47.070
My idea of service to America
does not fully embrace the Monroe

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:50.000
Doctrine, she wrote to him.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.300
These two area [inaudible]

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:53.950
but practical gentlemen
helped her make a foray

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:56.550
into Washington cultural circles.

00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:58.970
Her three successful
concerts at the Freer Gallery

00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:01.820
in 1924 would open
the door to her goal

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:06.220
of finding a permanent government
home base for her festivals.

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:10.780
Briskly moving forward, she
presented an unprecedented idea

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:15.260
to establish a concert series
within the libraries of Congress.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:20.030
Both the librarian and the Congress
had to be persuaded she said later.

00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:23.600
She possessed powerful
skills of persuasion.

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:27.670
In the long run, as the composer
Daniel Gregory Mason said,

00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:30.330
people usually did what
Mrs. Coolidge wanted.

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:34.630
It would be an unbelievably short
five minutes from her letter

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:38.960
of intent to the final signature
from President Coolidge.

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:44.620
This is the bill, and today is
the very day, 90 years to the day,

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:48.350
that Calvin Coolidge
signed this bill into law.

00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:52.440
Already today, we have talked
about this for an interview

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:55.440
with St. Lawrence quartet which
is premiering a new work tonight

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:57.900
in the Washington premier
of a new co-commission

00:08:57.900 --> 00:08:59.740
by John Adams which you'll hear.

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:04.960
And we talked about this fact and
how exciting it was 90 years today.

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:08.450
And the resolution
says to accept the gift

00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:11.460
of Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge for
the construction of an auditorium

00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:14.340
in connection with the Library
of Congress and to provide

00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:17.320
for the erection thereof.

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:21.910
So this is the shot built as you
know right in the courtyard there.

00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:25.420
They simply started
building from the ground up.

00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:28.090
From a techno file viewpoint,

00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:30.730
Mrs. Coolidge was astonishingly
prescient.

00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:34.260
She insisted on engaging a
team of German acousticians

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:38.460
and on wiring the Coolidge for
the very new medium of radio.

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:40.320
Thus, the very first
consent was heard

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:44.100
on the radio inaugurating an
astonishing 90 year tradition

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:46.820
of library broadcasts that
aired across the country

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:50.420
and developing an appreciation
for chamber music nationwide.

00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:53.890
She believed firmly that
if you could hear the best,

00:09:53.890 --> 00:09:55.620
you would begin to love it.

00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:58.930
And she talked about this in
promoting the radio broadcasts.

00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:03.270
For many decades, ours was the
longest running classical music

00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:04.760
series on the radio.

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:09.160
So let's hear what Mrs.
Coolidge said herself.

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:14.240
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge:
After some years in Pittsfield,

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:18.430 position:56%
my chamber music festivals had grown
to such proportions and seem to be

00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:23.330
so important that I decided to
perpetuate them by placing them

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:26.240
under institutional management.

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:29.810
Still another chance suggestion
then led me to consider the Library

00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:33.000
of Congress as the most
desirable, personal,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.990
and permanent administrator
of my cherished project.

00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:42.570
Dear Carl Engel and the Library
Mr. Herbert Putnam proved deeply

00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:46.990
sympathetic and enormously
helpful in bringing this about.

00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:49.550
And I was not only
very glad to share

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:52.380
in that increasingly
heavy responsibility,

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:55.470
but also welcome the
opportunity to establish

00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:58.890
in the government a little wedge
of authority in matters of art.

00:10:58.890 --> 00:11:02.950
I think I was even kindly accused

00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:06.150
of a little [inaudible]
and, perhaps, justly.

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:09.530
For I could wish for music the
same governmental protection

00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:14.530
that is given to hygiene,
education, or public welfare.

00:11:14.530 --> 00:11:16.320
How wonderful if we could have

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:20.390
in the cabinet a secretary
of fine arts.

00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:24.780
I feel that in the course of 26
years, my concerts have developed

00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:29.220
and guided my career as
much as I have guided them.

00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:31.950
One idea has evolved another.

00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:34.670
One event has grown into another.

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:39.740 position:56%
I have followed their direction into
paths at first entirely unforeseen.

00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:42.750
Until today I find
myself in your midst

00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:46.770
at this festival feeling the
radiation of friendship and beauty

00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:51.880
which chamber music broadcasts ooze
I feel the return messages augments

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:55.750
a thousand fold but center
in this little auditorium

00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:59.120
in the Library of Congress.

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:04.050
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: It's great to share
these bits of history with you.

00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:06.990
We have a lot of them in our
archives, and over the course

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:09.160
of the next year, we're
going to be pulling them out

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:14.910
and broadcasting them, podcasting
them, and making everybody aware

00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:19.140
of a lot of our treasures in
the history of the concerts.

00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:21.410
Many of the famous
musicians who performed here

00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:23.540
in Mrs. Coolidge's day
were her good friends.

00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:25.630
And you got an idea, a little bit,

00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:29.880
from herring her talk what
kind of a person she was.

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:32.980
She was warm and immensely engaged

00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:35.000
in music making as
a private citizen.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.300
She played chamber music with many,
many, many now legendary figures.

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:41.970
In Europe and in America.

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:46.960
She came with a great Rolodex
this is the Coolidge Medal

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:50.400
of Chamber Music that she created
in those early years to award

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:54.210
to people contributing
significantly to chamber music.

00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:56.620
Benjamin Britain was
an early recipient.

00:12:56.620 --> 00:13:00.630
I thought about that theory
of the great men in history.

00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:04.670 position:56%
The figures like Alexander the
Great, George Washington, and so on.

00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:06.680
People who don't merely
participate in history,

00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:08.380
they make it or chart it somehow.

00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:11.130
And things would have been
very different without them.

00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:14.710
With this highly debatable
idea in mind, it's instructive

00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:17.610
to review some of the prime
movers we've seen here.

00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:21.450
Magisterial interpreters
and great musical thinkers.

00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:24.630
Our concert archives
document their contributions,

00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:28.040 position:56%
trends in composition, and
performance practices, and the shift

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:31.910
and sway of intellectual
and societal currents.

00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:36.260 position:56%
One such performer was Vondelon
Dovska [phonetic], a harpsichordist,

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:40.070
the major force in the revival
of early music and a pioneer

00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:42.040
as was Mrs. Coolidge herself

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:45.150
who would present other
pioneers was Safford Cape,

00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:47.510
Noah Greenberg, and Alfred Deller.

00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:51.590
She also underwrote substantial
musicological research.

00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:55.170
She was a champion of the very,
very old as well as the very new.

00:13:55.170 --> 00:14:00.840
The famous Hampton Institute
Choir appeared here in 1926

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:04.530
with the composer R
Nathaniel Dett as conductor.

00:14:04.530 --> 00:14:06.170
Their program was striking.

00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:09.880
Renaissance music, Russian
liturgical music, French songs,

00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:15.540
and spirituals described in that
program as Negro folk anthems.

00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:17.970
Carl Engel had offered
Dett a commission

00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:21.970 position:56%
from the Coolidge foundation
suggesting a work for violin, piano,

00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:24.800
saxophone, and banjo with a thought

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:28.730
to bring together European
tradition with American influence.

00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:31.580
Dett returned a dignified
letter saying, quote,

00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:36.020
any effort from the outside to
lay down rather strict lines along

00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:40.560
which art should develop can only
result in self consciousness and,

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:45.010
consequently, in artistic
and in sincere results.

00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:49.400
The 1928 Coolidge Commission

00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:53.370 position:56%
for [inaudible] brought together the
Russian-born choreographer Adolph

00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:56.780
Bolm with Igor Stravinsky
as the composer.

00:14:56.780 --> 00:15:02.400
Mrs. Coolidge's good friends
[inaudible] had already declined.

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:06.470
Bolm toured with Anna Pavlova,
created a frenzy in his solos

00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:07.820
for the [inaudible] dances.

00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:10.860
And Prince Igor, he would
create his own company,

00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:13.540
and he would also bring
[inaudible] ballet ruse

00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:16.150
to the U.S. on its second tour.

00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:19.790
I went too far for a second.

00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:24.270
Stravinsky would also come back to
the Library to perform on a concert

00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:27.640
of his, just his music, in 1935.

00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:30.510
Including his divergemento
concertino [phonetic]

00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:34.170
at least to our [inaudible].

00:15:34.170 --> 00:15:37.470
Bayla Bartaugh whose string
quartet number five stands as one

00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:39.880
of the major Coolidge
commissions performed here

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:42.430
with Yoseph Ziggity
[phonetic] in 1940.

00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:46.040
In a poignant and historic concert
that holds a place in the heart

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:49.320
of every Hungarian still today.

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:53.470
This shows the program as signed
by the artist and the first page

00:15:53.470 --> 00:15:57.360
of the Bartaugh Fifth
String Quartet.

00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:01.750
Plus, the image of the CD
cover is a recent reissue,

00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:05.690
and these historic recordings
do keep becoming reissued

00:16:05.690 --> 00:16:07.020
and reissued and reissued.

00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:08.750
It's both heartwarming
and frustrating.

00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:10.340
It's heartwarming and
wonderful to know

00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:13.670
that these artistic achievements
still stand and are still very,

00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:16.670
very much admired and
in demand by people.

00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:20.310
It's frustrating that we can't
make them available ourselves, but,

00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:23.670
anyway, I should say
pristine classical is a firm

00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:25.930
that has issued quite
a few of these.

00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:28.990
Including the one we'll
talk about next.

00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:31.170
It was the memory of
Bartaugh's performance here

00:16:31.170 --> 00:16:32.830
that persuaded Yorgi
Cortauch [phonetic]

00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:35.330
to accept a commission
from the Library.

00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:39.200
Our 2009 shot shows the composer

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:43.450
with his wife Marta
during their performance.

00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:45.100
Thee joined a long, long line

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:48.170
of composer performers here
including Hindemith, Copeland,

00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:52.470
Barber, Bernstein, and
Kromm among many others.

00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:55.660
Relationships here do often
run through generations.

00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:58.360
And the Library has been
home to complete families

00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:00.530
of musicians in some cases.

00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:03.470
Adolph Bush and Rudolph
[inaudible], his son in law,

00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:06.780
made their American
debuted here in 1938.

00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:10.050
They gave a total of 21
concerts together on our stage

00:17:10.050 --> 00:17:11.910
and also appeared separately.

00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:16.490
For nearly 60 years the Library
enjoyed a very cordial friendship

00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:19.480
with these founders of
the Marlboro Festival.

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:22.850
This is the shot of the
founders including Marcel

00:17:22.850 --> 00:17:27.710
and Blanche [inaudible]
and Bush [inaudible], too.

00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:31.330
The Marlboro collection
is in our archives.

00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:36.560
One of the most influential
pedagogues of the 20th century,

00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:39.740
Nadia Boulanger, molded
the musical perceptions

00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:42.140
of several generations of teachers.

00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:45.830
The 1939 recording you'll
here now opens a little window

00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:47.830
into performance practice.

00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:51.900 position:56%
Thinking about that, I wish that we
also had a few more of these in time

00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:55.240
to play them like one of John
McCormick, the famous tenor,

00:17:55.240 --> 00:18:00.250
singing Bach and Handle here
with Howard Hanson conducting

00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:03.900
or Alfred Deller singing
renaissance songs.

00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:06.630
You feel the charisma of
Boulanger's personality

00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:09.510
as she demonstrates
Monteverdi on the piano.

00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:16.050
[ Silence ]

00:18:16.050 --> 00:18:19.130
The clip will come
up in just a second.

00:18:19.130 --> 00:18:23.530
I should say that this Monteverdi
madrigal recording is still a sign

00:18:23.530 --> 00:18:25.570
post for researchers.

00:18:25.570 --> 00:18:29.650
And as a side note, Mrs. Coolidge
underwrote the complete Monteverdi

00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:34.420
edition edited by John [inaudible].

00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:54.510
[ Inaudible ]

00:18:54.510 --> 00:19:23.260
[ Music ]

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:24.670
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Boulanger
was the first woman

00:19:24.670 --> 00:19:26.510
to conduct the Boston
Symphony Orchestra

00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:28.350
in the New York Philharmonic.

00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:32.370
Her concerts here, two of them
in 1939, were very modern.

00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:35.210
They were combination
platters juxtaposing old

00:19:35.210 --> 00:19:37.000
and newly commissioned work.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.700
Again, these are very
forward looking ideas

00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:41.820
that we're talking about, it's
really fascinating to go back

00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:44.500
and read the programs
of those early years.

00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:47.680
Conductors, let's just think
about conductors for a moment.

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:50.780
Given the size of our stage,
there have been a startling number

00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:53.390
of sizable chamber orchestras
here in the early years

00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:55.730
and many significant
conductors beginning

00:19:55.730 --> 00:19:59.620 position:56%
with the Chicago symphony's
Frederick Stock have performed here.

00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:01.580
Stock was at the very,
very first concert.

00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:04.370
He was a friend of Mrs. Coolidge.

00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:09.040
This is Hans Kindler, the cellist
who was the first NSO conductor.

00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:12.010
Ossip Gabrilowitsch who
married Mark Twain's daughter,

00:20:12.010 --> 00:20:15.280
the contralto, Clara Clemens.

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:19.260
George Szell on the left, he
performed here with the Budapest.

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:22.960
Stokowski on the bottom
and Serge Koussevitzky.

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:28.180
Bernstein who performed with the
Juilliard, a racing rendition

00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:30.630
of the [inaudible] piano quintet.

00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:33.170
And Sir Thomas Beecham.

00:20:33.170 --> 00:20:35.140
Beecham's 1956 lecture here

00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:39.200
on Mozart shows us vividly how the
reputations of even the greatest

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:43.450
of composers come and go in
the vagaries of public opinion.

00:20:43.450 --> 00:20:47.320
The reevaluation of
Mozart 60 years ago,

00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:50.930
something that's really shocking
to contemplate was partly due

00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:52.730
to Beecham's championship.

00:20:52.730 --> 00:21:01.080
[ Silence ]

00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:02.660
Oh, that's okay.

00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:07.160
Beecham, he was, as you may hear in
a moment or not, it doesn't matter.

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:09.370
Beecham's lecture was
trenchant and funny.

00:21:09.370 --> 00:21:11.660
And his instincts were
right on the mark.

00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:14.710
The orchestra is a
modern invention, he said.

00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:19.820
Do not be taken in by it and it
goes on to say, there is no promise

00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:22.550
that the orchestra as
we know it today will be

00:21:22.550 --> 00:21:24.320
around in 50 years' time.

00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:28.450
That's pretty forward
looking, as I say.

00:21:28.450 --> 00:21:31.100
Classical music has always
been the heart of the series

00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:34.300
and our major private funds have
been given for this purpose.

00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:38.100 position:56%
Over time, the focus has expanded
growing toward the broad perspective

00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:39.870
crucial for a national institution.

00:21:39.870 --> 00:21:44.780
In 1928, the music division founded
the archive of American folk song,

00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:47.210
now part of the American
folk live center.

00:21:47.210 --> 00:21:50.190
Its focus on field recordings
capturing the essence

00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:52.200
of live performance
meant that recording

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:56.100 position:56%
and documenting America's vernacular
music became an important part

00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:57.880
of the music division's mandate.

00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:01.080
Figures like John and
Alan Lomax, later Charles

00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:03.840
and Ruth Crawford Seeger,
and other noteworthy scholars

00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:06.110
of American song came to work here.

00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:08.590
This answers our question
about how the library got

00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:11.680
into making very fine
live concert recording.

00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:15.190
By 1937, every concert
was recorded here.

00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:19.370
And by 1940, top flight
engineers were recording

00:22:19.370 --> 00:22:23.240
on 16 inch acetate discs
still preserved here

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:24.810
with startlingly good results.

00:22:24.810 --> 00:22:26.210
You'll hear one in a minute.

00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:28.810
So aside from the important
documentation

00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:32.830 position:56%
of the concerts themselves, this
amazing archive offers a useful view

00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:36.490
of American musical culture over
three quarters of a century.

00:22:36.490 --> 00:22:41.030
For the October 1929, Coolidge
Festival of Chamber music,

00:22:41.030 --> 00:22:44.500
folk song collector John Jacob
Nyles performed [inaudible] ballads

00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:47.650
and African American
spirituals followed

00:22:47.650 --> 00:22:52.050
by a jazz orchestra playing Rude
Bloom's [phonetic] Song of Bayou

00:22:52.050 --> 00:22:54.930
and WC Handy St. Louis blues.

00:22:54.930 --> 00:22:57.440
The conductor was the musical
polymath [phonetic] Nathaniel

00:22:57.440 --> 00:23:00.010
Shillkret, composer,
multi instrumentalist,

00:23:00.010 --> 00:23:02.090
and a master musical stylist.

00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:06.430
Like a combination maybe of Paul
Schaeffer,[inaudible] the Roots,

00:23:06.430 --> 00:23:08.040
and, you know, those days.

00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:10.870
He was involved with the
victor talking machine company

00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:12.170
for many years.

00:23:12.170 --> 00:23:14.460
This is not the precise
orchestra that came here,

00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:18.100
but it's one from that year
or very close to that time.

00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:21.180
It's quite remarkable to see these
artists featured alongside the

00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:24.510
flutist George Barrere,
pianist Harold Bauer,

00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:26.880 position:56%
and the conductor Leopold Stokowski.

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:29.630
Stokowski conducted members of
the Philadelphia orchestra here

00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:31.950
with the [inaudible]
organ concerto and,

00:23:31.950 --> 00:23:35.030
yes there was an organ
in the Coolidge then.

00:23:35.030 --> 00:23:38.900
And a transcription of
JS Box the art of fugue.

00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:42.150
A note about Stokowski, he would
soon become a vice president

00:23:42.150 --> 00:23:44.750
of the friends of music and
the Library of Congress.

00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:47.230
And several of you here
tonight are generous members

00:23:47.230 --> 00:23:49.360
of our new incarnation
of that group.

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:52.640
The president then was Nicholas
Longworth, Speaker of the House

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:55.160
of Representatives and
an impressive violinist.

00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:58.250
Stokowski would return
to the Library in 1955

00:23:58.250 --> 00:24:02.670
and '60 conducting the symphony of
the air and making some experiments

00:24:02.670 --> 00:24:06.460
in the Coolidge with people from
Bell Labs on stereo recording.

00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:11.510
In 1940, the music division
celebrated the 75th anniversary

00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:14.760
of the emancipation
proclamation with a concert series

00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:18.160
of both classical and folk
music, including a work

00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:19.470
by the black composer [inaudible],

00:24:19.470 --> 00:24:24.740
and they presented the first
black solo artist to appear here,

00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:26.920
Dorothy Maher and Roland Hayes.

00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:29.030
Concluding it was a
milestone evening

00:24:29.030 --> 00:24:32.290
with the poet Sterling
Brown, a landlock,

00:24:32.290 --> 00:24:34.350
a figure from the Harlem
Renaissance,

00:24:34.350 --> 00:24:37.450
and others including the
Golden Gate and Josh White.

00:24:37.450 --> 00:24:42.510
And we have a clip from that
recording for that concert.

00:24:42.510 --> 00:25:04.040
[ Music ]

00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:05.340
It gives you an idea.

00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:06.640
I wish we had time to
hear this whole thing

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:08.950
because it's very interesting.

00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:12.280
[Inaudible] between, a main singer,
kind of a call and response person.

00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:14.950 position:56%
And then they have a choral section.

00:25:14.950 --> 00:25:17.980
And while you're listening to it,
you flash through all the styles

00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:19.590
that we're now currently
familiar with.

00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:23.390
I wanted you to hear this
because of the very good sound.

00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:26.510
That was the sound through
the 1940s, very close miched

00:25:26.510 --> 00:25:29.580
and very high standard technically.

00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:32.600
And let's not forget Jelly Roll
Morton's historic recording session

00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:34.570
here in 1938.

00:25:34.570 --> 00:25:37.930
Lomax went to meet
Morton at his night club,

00:25:37.930 --> 00:25:40.810
the Music Box on U Street here.

00:25:40.810 --> 00:25:43.330
He came back and asked
his boss, Harold Speevak,

00:25:43.330 --> 00:25:47.320
the chief of the music
division, for 100 acetate discs

00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:51.430
to record an epic recording
session that spring and summer.

00:25:51.430 --> 00:25:54.080
Moving to another milestone
and we'll have to raise,

00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:57.370
have to talk fast because there's
a lot of good stuff to cover.

00:25:57.370 --> 00:26:01.290
We often talk about Gertrude Clark
Woodall Whittall's mid 1930s gift

00:26:01.290 --> 00:26:02.730
of five [inaudible] instruments.

00:26:02.730 --> 00:26:05.070
Another has path breaking moment.

00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:07.590
At the time, this was the
only ensemble of its type

00:26:07.590 --> 00:26:10.750
in North America, and for
many years the only one owned

00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:12.690
by a government institution.

00:26:12.690 --> 00:26:15.280
She also gave the Library
this beautiful room

00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:16.970
and many holograph manuscripts.

00:26:16.970 --> 00:26:21.210
Moon them ones by Broms, Beethoven,
Mozart, [inaudible] and others.

00:26:21.210 --> 00:26:25.110
Plus Schoenberg's [inaudible], a
favorite piece from Mrs. Whittall.

00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:28.410
Somebody asked me before I was
thinking of giving this talk

00:26:28.410 --> 00:26:31.960
if I knew of any ghosts
associated with the series.

00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:34.640
Perhaps, the closest thing
might be Mrs. Whittall saying

00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:41.740
that if we programmed
[inaudible], she would come back.

00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:44.490
I'll reveal one of the secrets
of the Coolidge auditorium.

00:26:44.490 --> 00:26:47.000
And this is a real insider
piece of information.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.030
It was designed not only for
chamber music but, particularly,

00:26:50.030 --> 00:26:53.490
for beautiful string chamber
music from the very beginning.

00:26:53.490 --> 00:26:56.820
When the acousticians were
experimenting in there.

00:26:56.820 --> 00:27:00.130
And pausing for a sneak
preview moment, I can tell you

00:27:00.130 --> 00:27:03.880
that next season we will present
among others the Michelangelo

00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:08.490
Quartet, and we'll have a return
for the [inaudible] Quartet.

00:27:08.490 --> 00:27:11.160
Acquiring our strives
led to a library first

00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:15.470
that is now a very widespread idea
and that is a residency project.

00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:19.440
For a time after Mrs. Whittall
chose these instruments

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:22.560
with Louis [inaudible] help,
they were not played regularly,

00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:25.900 position:56%
and there was some talk about hiring
musicians to come in and play them

00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:29.980
to keep them in shape, paying
the musicians $2.50 an hour.

00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:33.650
The Budapest Quartet would
become resident artists here

00:27:33.650 --> 00:27:37.220
from 1940 to 1962.

00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:40.600
Violinist Robert Mann says that in
his teen years, the Budapest was

00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:43.960
without doubt the most famous
chamber ensemble known by name

00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:46.500
in the world at that time.

00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:50.600
They performed hundreds of
concerts here during their tenure.

00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:53.640
The shot goes along with
a pregenerated PR myth

00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:57.920
that they requested separate
tables at restaurants.

00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:00.000
June Schneider had became the wife

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.450
of the Budapest cellist
Micha Schneider,

00:28:02.450 --> 00:28:04.070
is still a good friend
of the Library.

00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:05.440
I know some of you may know her,

00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:07.360
and she's given the
inside scoop on all that.

00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:09.560
It was just a myth.

00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:14.620 position:56%
This is their shot of their cover of
their recording with Benny Goodman.

00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:17.850
The Juilliard.

00:28:17.850 --> 00:28:19.950
This, I'm sorry you can't
really see these well.

00:28:19.950 --> 00:28:23.280
But in the future, these are
brand new plasmas by their way,

00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:25.540
and they're kind of
bigger than we're used to.

00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:26.840
They're good, though.

00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:30.960
Just some point we're going to
put this picture in the brochure

00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:34.070
or in a program or news letter
because it's virtually the only one

00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:36.430
from those years which
shows the audience.

00:28:36.430 --> 00:28:39.210
We're going to rectify that.

00:28:39.210 --> 00:28:41.580
Both these quartets gave memorable

00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:45.600
and sometimes transcendent
performances

00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:48.590
that seem almost sacral
to some music fans.

00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:51.260
And they brought many of
their friends to perform.

00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:53.060
George Zell.

00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:57.040
[ Inaudible Names ]

00:28:57.040 --> 00:29:00.370
And others who joined them in
our studio right behind the stage

00:29:00.370 --> 00:29:05.050 position:56%
where they rehearsed, ate lunch, and
sometimes watched the world series.

00:29:05.050 --> 00:29:08.290
One even Alexander
Schneider put a pinup photo

00:29:08.290 --> 00:29:10.810
in [inaudible] music just
before they went onstage,

00:29:10.810 --> 00:29:13.490
an act you don't associate
with these artists.

00:29:13.490 --> 00:29:15.500
And the mystified audience wondered

00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:18.160
through the evening why
all four musicians seemed

00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:22.520
to be periodically convulsed
during their performance.

00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:24.920
When Mrs. Coolidge's ear
trumpet malfunctioned

00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:27.810
and she could be heard speaking
very loudly in the concert hall,

00:29:27.810 --> 00:29:30.940
he leaned, Alexander leaned
over to the audience to say

00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:34.210
and now a word from our sponsor.

00:29:34.210 --> 00:29:36.310
This rehearsal clip now coming

00:29:36.310 --> 00:29:40.000
up shows our sound engineer
having the mics opened

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000
by sheer chance during a rehearsal.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:46.510
And it shows a side of the Budapest
most people would never know.

00:29:46.510 --> 00:30:12.530
[ Music ]

00:30:12.530 --> 00:30:16.950
That's good, yeah, thank you.

00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:18.540
The interest of significant donors

00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:21.160
like Mrs. Whittall have
often provided an impetus

00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:22.880
for new directions.

00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:26.150
By some mysterious confluence,
all the major patrons

00:30:26.150 --> 00:30:28.490
of the Library series
have been women.

00:30:28.490 --> 00:30:29.910
And as Sue said last month,

00:30:29.910 --> 00:30:33.640
we'd really like to
diversify that pattern.

00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:37.150
Mrs. Coolidge, Mrs. Whittall, the
only one who was not a musician,

00:30:37.150 --> 00:30:40.440
Leonora Jackson McKim,
Adeline Croft a pianist

00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:45.590
and longtime concert goer here
who underwrote a residency

00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:47.320
for the Bozard [phonetic] Trio.

00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:51.910
Carolyn Royal Just, an attorney but
also an amateur orchestra musician.

00:30:51.910 --> 00:30:55.390
And now, recently, composer
and pianist Dina Koston.

00:30:55.390 --> 00:30:59.310
We have many funds and many donors,
and I just wanted to mention a few

00:30:59.310 --> 00:31:03.940
of them, but it is
extraordinary that they were women.

00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:07.850
Leonora Jackson was the first
American female violinist

00:31:07.850 --> 00:31:09.290
to be hailed in Europe.

00:31:09.290 --> 00:31:13.210
She was a noteworthy artist who
was a student of [inaudible]

00:31:13.210 --> 00:31:16.140
and later owned his
[inaudible] violin.

00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:19.380
She performed with the Boston and
London orchestras among others,

00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:24.370
and on returning from Europe had a
substantial performing career given

00:31:24.370 --> 00:31:27.830 position:56%
over 160 concerts in one year alone.

00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:31.180
After her marriage at age 36,
she withdrew from the stage

00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:35.040
as so many people did in
those days when they married.

00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:39.100
We in researching Mrs. McKim
understood finally why the terms

00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:41.880
of her bequest refer
to given funding

00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:44.330
to American students of the violin.

00:31:44.330 --> 00:31:47.960
Not meanly to underwrite concerts
or commissions but to give money

00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:53.030
to fund scholarships for
American students of the violin.

00:31:53.030 --> 00:31:56.600
The McKim fund is commissioned more
than 65 compositions for violin

00:31:56.600 --> 00:32:00.490 position:56%
and piano, several decades' worth
of styles and performance techniques

00:32:00.490 --> 00:32:04.090
from composers like Gunther
Schuller, Elliot Carter,

00:32:04.090 --> 00:32:07.570
Bright Sheng, and Roberto
Sierra plus [inaudible]

00:32:07.570 --> 00:32:12.300
and McArthur winners Anthony
Braxton and Cecil Taylor.

00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:16.030
This is a shot of a CD that was
recorded here at the Library.

00:32:16.030 --> 00:32:19.460
And although you can't
tell, this is on stage.

00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:22.770
And I should say that we presented
Braxton and Cecil Taylor long,

00:32:22.770 --> 00:32:26.380
long before they were
on the McArthur radar.

00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:29.750
The Ira and Leonore S
Gershwin fund has allowed us

00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:31.880
to present first rate
concert versions

00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:34.020
of many great Broadway composers.

00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:37.700
[Inaudible] Kern, Richard
Rogers, Porter, Berlin,

00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:39.590
Herbert, and Steven [inaudible].

00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:43.200
And recent ones like last
fall's Broadway showcase.

00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:46.750
And, of course, the Gershwin
prize for popular song is a new

00:32:46.750 --> 00:32:50.670
and major direction with a huge
media presence for the Library.

00:32:50.670 --> 00:32:55.770
I hope some of you caught the
Billy Joel program on television.

00:32:55.770 --> 00:32:59.920
Carolyn Royal Just Fund has given
us the chance for programming

00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:03.650
across a broad range of genres
including classical primarily

00:33:03.650 --> 00:33:06.620
but also pop and multimedia
projects.

00:33:06.620 --> 00:33:10.000
Dina Koston's recent bequest
allows us to look forward

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:14.130
to a tremendously exciting
future for new music here.

00:33:14.130 --> 00:33:17.370
So I'll just whip through
a few images

00:33:17.370 --> 00:33:22.420
that show an ever expanding
portfolio for the Library.

00:33:25.230 --> 00:33:29.640
It's nice into a color
era for photographs.

00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:32.430
This concert, this is Tito
[inaudible] performing Terry

00:33:32.430 --> 00:33:35.260
Library's bicentennial
concert in 20000.

00:33:35.260 --> 00:33:39.740
Also, two other [inaudible] artists
Ralph Stanley who's still very much

00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:43.480
performing and Clarence
Gatemouth Brown who's passed away.

00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:49.900
After this lightning overview
of the Library's concert series,

00:33:49.900 --> 00:33:53.230
let's look at some thoughts for
the future and some observations

00:33:53.230 --> 00:33:57.530
with some help from our
advisor, Mrs. Coolidge.

00:33:59.070 --> 00:34:02.230
One major thing for a 90th
anniversary will be honoring our

00:34:02.230 --> 00:34:04.990
distinguished history as a
champion of contemporary music.

00:34:04.990 --> 00:34:07.720
The St. Lawrence Quartet
performance tonight

00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:11.310
of a brand new John Adams
work, a Library co-commission,

00:34:11.310 --> 00:34:14.540
makes a great springboard
towards impressive package

00:34:14.540 --> 00:34:19.450
of 11 new commissions
within the next 90 weeks.

00:34:19.450 --> 00:34:22.730
The line-up of composers include
a new work from Brian Ferneyhough

00:34:22.730 --> 00:34:24.590
with the [inaudible] ensemble.

00:34:24.590 --> 00:34:28.330
A new oratorio commission,
very unusual for the Library

00:34:28.330 --> 00:34:32.790
by Gabriela Lena Frank,
and the work is set

00:34:32.790 --> 00:34:35.700
to text by Ralph Waldo Emerson.

00:34:35.700 --> 00:34:39.110
It's a co-commission with
the Handel and Haydn Society,

00:34:39.110 --> 00:34:43.900
marking its 200th anniversary
and our 90thoonversery.

00:34:43.900 --> 00:34:47.260
So maybe this is a good
time to mention one

00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:52.100 position:56%
of the big challenges we face, cash.

00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:56.540
Mrs. Coolidge's check to Maurice
Ravel reminds us that in the era

00:34:56.540 --> 00:35:00.910
of a patron like her and many
of the other major arts patrons

00:35:00.910 --> 00:35:02.590
of the early 20th century

00:35:02.590 --> 00:35:07.700
like Isabella Stuart
Gardener, it was very simple.

00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:12.380
One could write a check
if one had the means.

00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:17.430
Mrs. Coolidge did continue through
her time here to work closely

00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:21.690
with the music division chiefs
to support things herself.

00:35:21.690 --> 00:35:25.050
Today, it's a much more
complicated structure as we know.

00:35:25.050 --> 00:35:28.480
We are free from the necessity
of making money and with

00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:32.310
that luxury can avoid what
Mrs. Coolidge called, quote,

00:35:32.310 --> 00:35:36.430
the deadening influence
of social fashion.

00:35:36.430 --> 00:35:41.750
But our production costs alone for
one evening are currently $7,500.

00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:47.180
So this is a challenge with
which we will need your help.

00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:51.890
We would love to work with all our
friends to think about new ways

00:35:51.890 --> 00:35:54.380
to fund the Library's concerts.

00:35:55.430 --> 00:36:01.650
As we close up our conversation,
I wanted to bring back the image

00:36:01.650 --> 00:36:04.190
of Mrs. Coolidge in the
sergeant charcoal [inaudible].

00:36:04.190 --> 00:36:10.320
That is the most modern
image we have of her.

00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:13.570
Today, she would be
called a media visionary

00:36:13.570 --> 00:36:16.880
and a cultural entrepreneur.

00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:23.540
So with her as a guide, let's wrap
up with a glimpse of the future.

00:36:23.540 --> 00:36:26.610
Today, in an increasingly
wired world,

00:36:26.610 --> 00:36:29.370
people are seeking
transformational experiences

00:36:29.370 --> 00:36:33.900
in the time they spend
pursuing art and entertainment.

00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:36.520
I'd like to make the
possibly outrageous statement

00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:40.110
that the library has been
providing those for a long time.

00:36:40.110 --> 00:36:44.010
How can we continue to deliver
them in the next 90 years?

00:36:44.010 --> 00:36:47.370
And what will our challenges
and new directions be?

00:36:47.370 --> 00:36:51.880 position:56%
For all art presenters, there are
tack tonic shifts now in the concept

00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:55.020
of culture itself and
how we consume it.

00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:58.920
New audience research by Arthur
Cohen of [inaudible] Cohen,

00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:03.800
the Culture Track is the
name of his firm project.

00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:05.960
This research says that
today people are beginning

00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:08.310
to define the cultural
experience as something

00:37:08.310 --> 00:37:11.200
like visiting a national
park or reading a back.

00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:13.380 position:56%
Not just attending a cultural event.

00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:15.820
And as for events, we don't have

00:37:15.820 --> 00:37:19.860
to leave our computers
to experience them now.

00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:27.210
Here are some statistics from an
agency called alienation digital.

00:37:27.210 --> 00:37:32.480
In North America, around 168
million people use mobile phones.

00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:36.400
Why not develop phone
friendly programming?

00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:39.160
Eighty seven percent of
Americans news the Internet

00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:43.670
and a whopping 67 percent use at
least one social network spending

00:37:43.670 --> 00:37:48.390
at least three hours
or more a day online.

00:37:48.390 --> 00:37:51.560
The music division's Facebook
page is increasingly popular,

00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:52.860
I'm happy to say.

00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:55.600
And if you haven't seen it,
you might really enjoy it.

00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:59.830
We will be expecting to broaden our
social media presence in platforms

00:37:59.830 --> 00:38:05.400 position:56%
like Twitter which saw more than
one billion Tweets on music in 2013.

00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:08.400
It was the most popular subject.

00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:10.400
And other platforms like Tumblr

00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:14.150
and Pinterest will draw our
interest and our vision.

00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:18.800
I learned that Pinterest is very
attractive to young women 18

00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:22.100
to 39, an interesting market.

00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:26.050
Instagram, Reddit, many,
many platforms are available.

00:38:26.050 --> 00:38:28.760
Is it easy to work in these
to develop programming?

00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:30.480
No, but it will be fascinating.

00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:34.710
In fact, the Library is
ideally suited to creating

00:38:34.710 --> 00:38:39.400
and curating terrific
cultural content for the web.

00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:44.230 position:56%
One venture will be a plan to design
and deliver web friendly content

00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:47.150
to take the library's
hidden wealth of knowledge

00:38:47.150 --> 00:38:51.390
to the vast audience
of music lovers online.

00:38:51.390 --> 00:38:55.290
We are all as a team of
programmers at the Library

00:38:55.290 --> 00:38:59.880
from [inaudible] our chief through
our staff of the music division,

00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:04.710
very enthusiastic about planning
public events, live streaming,

00:39:04.710 --> 00:39:07.190
and curated web programming.

00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:12.910
Again, a comment from Mrs.
Coolidge that's extremely timely.

00:39:12.910 --> 00:39:15.810
Some programmer, I went to a
conference last week in New York,

00:39:15.810 --> 00:39:19.130
the International Society for
Performing Arts Conference.

00:39:19.130 --> 00:39:23.620
And the same question came up
there which came up with the advent

00:39:23.620 --> 00:39:29.630 position:56%
of radio which was, will radio take
away live concert audience interest?

00:39:29.630 --> 00:39:33.000
And Mrs. Coolidge's comment
then, she really pushed forward

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.050 position:56%
to have the Library go on the radio.

00:39:35.050 --> 00:39:40.150 position:56%
She said some converts conservatives
feared this radio competition

00:39:40.150 --> 00:39:42.430
with personal appearances.

00:39:42.430 --> 00:39:45.020
Meaning, competition
with live concerts.

00:39:45.020 --> 00:39:50.400
But I believe that it ultimately
increased their audiences.

00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:52.100
And, in fact, that's
what the research

00:39:52.100 --> 00:39:53.980
that we heard last week indicates.

00:39:53.980 --> 00:39:59.110
That people today are not merely
only going to one type of music,

00:39:59.110 --> 00:40:03.990
they are not going to
experience music in one manner.

00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:06.670
They like to sample
many different ways

00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:09.640
of experience and consuming music.

00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:14.760
Regarding demographics
and outreach, by 2020,

00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:20.050
40 percent of the U.S. will be what
are described as minorities today.

00:40:20.050 --> 00:40:24.270 position:56%
By 2060, one third of the
potential audience for any presenter

00:40:24.270 --> 00:40:27.070
in the performing arts
will be Hispanic.

00:40:27.070 --> 00:40:32.310
These are arbitrary terms as
we know, but you see the drift.

00:40:32.310 --> 00:40:34.270
It does seem certain that Americans

00:40:34.270 --> 00:40:37.450
of all backgrounds will newt
have the elementary school music

00:40:37.450 --> 00:40:39.020
education that most of us

00:40:39.020 --> 00:40:42.220
in this room were fortunate
enough to receive.

00:40:42.220 --> 00:40:45.890
Outreach for the Library will be
an ongoing challenge and will need

00:40:45.890 --> 00:40:49.140
to increase the social
factor for public programs

00:40:49.140 --> 00:40:55.000
as this is an increasing value
for cultural consumers under 35.

00:40:55.000 --> 00:41:00.200
Interestingly, one research
item I learned was that oldest

00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:04.250
and the oldest and youngest
generations do have the most

00:41:04.250 --> 00:41:07.930
in common, free time.

00:41:07.930 --> 00:41:11.320
It's the midrange patrons
with children,

00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:16.430
small children particularly,
who are most pressed for time.

00:41:16.430 --> 00:41:21.590 position:56%
Social factors are going to be
tricky for Library given the issues.

00:41:21.590 --> 00:41:24.500
We only have so much
room to socialize in.

00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:27.980
But tonight we have a really
fun gesture in this area.

00:41:27.980 --> 00:41:31.610
We invite you all to
visit our photo booth.

00:41:31.610 --> 00:41:34.680
We are gathering pictures and
stories from our audience members

00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:39.930 position:56%
that we can use over the coming 90th
anniversary months in our brochure,

00:41:39.930 --> 00:41:42.160
on the web, in newsletters.

00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:45.830
And we also want to hear from
you how long have you been coming

00:41:45.830 --> 00:41:47.980
to the Library, what's
your experience about it?

00:41:47.980 --> 00:41:50.820
And when you came in, you
probably saw the photo booth set up

00:41:50.820 --> 00:41:52.490
and wondered what is
this, what, what?

00:41:52.490 --> 00:41:56.260
So if you have time,
please join us there,

00:41:56.260 --> 00:41:59.560
and we'd love to have your photo.

00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:02.410
With outreach in general, we
invoke our founders' name again

00:42:02.410 --> 00:42:03.980
with admiration.

00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:07.850
She was the guru of outreach really
sponsoring thousands of programs

00:42:07.850 --> 00:42:10.900
in educational institutions
nationwide.

00:42:10.900 --> 00:42:13.860
Run outs to interesting
venues and collaborations

00:42:13.860 --> 00:42:17.460
with other institutions will
be a part of our future.

00:42:17.460 --> 00:42:20.330
We'll be continuing the crucial
mandate to serve Congress

00:42:20.330 --> 00:42:21.830
and the American people

00:42:21.830 --> 00:42:25.540
and underscoring the goal
of cultural democracy.

00:42:25.540 --> 00:42:29.360
Representing a diversity of
musical expression to an audience

00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:34.560
that is diverse is important
throughout the decades.

00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:37.200
You've probably noticed
our tagline this season,

00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:40.160
an exclusive experience
for everyone.

00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:43.890
Being able to work for a concert
series that is offered free

00:42:43.890 --> 00:42:47.710
to the public is a
remarkable privilege.

00:42:47.710 --> 00:42:51.390
Marketers advise to us
presenters multiple means

00:42:51.390 --> 00:42:53.860
of engagement with our audiences.

00:42:53.860 --> 00:42:56.180
For radio, we're 90 for 90 now.

00:42:56.180 --> 00:42:58.870
We've been on the air
an astonishing 90 years.

00:42:58.870 --> 00:43:05.440
We have a new radio series in
Washington on WETA that will come

00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:08.010
up in march and around the country.

00:43:08.010 --> 00:43:10.890
Stay tuned also for some
new directions in radio

00:43:10.890 --> 00:43:14.710
for a 2015/16 season and
its contemporary music.

00:43:14.710 --> 00:43:16.640
I won't say anything
more about that.

00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:22.070
I will show a couple of photos,
these are just a few, a few.

00:43:22.070 --> 00:43:26.410
And as I say, you are all the
recipients of the sneak preview.

00:43:26.410 --> 00:43:30.310
These are just a few of the
eleven or possibly 12 commissions

00:43:30.310 --> 00:43:34.170
that we have coming up next
year within the next 90 months.

00:43:34.170 --> 00:43:37.650
One is in March, you will probably
hear, some of you will hear it,

00:43:37.650 --> 00:43:39.770
and you may know about it already.

00:43:39.770 --> 00:43:43.160
Jennifer Higdon with the Curtis
Orchestra and Roberto Diaz.

00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:46.950
Brian Ferneyhough from Stanford.

00:43:46.950 --> 00:43:50.790
He will be premiering, we will
be premiering a new work from him

00:43:50.790 --> 00:43:53.120
with a large chamber ensemble.

00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:57.290
Gabriela Lena Frank is the composer
of the oratorio that I mentioned

00:43:57.290 --> 00:43:59.830
with Handel and Haydn Society.

00:43:59.830 --> 00:44:02.970 position:56%
And the last person is Paul Landsky.

00:44:02.970 --> 00:44:05.130
We'll have a woodwind quintet.

00:44:05.130 --> 00:44:08.200
And also, I'm coming to
the end of my time here,

00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:11.070
but I wanted to mention
a very exciting program.

00:44:11.070 --> 00:44:13.880
We didn't have the time to
get into Aaron Copeland,

00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:19.090
but Copeland is an example of
a composer, one among many,

00:44:19.090 --> 00:44:22.980
within the Library as had a
long relationship over decades.

00:44:22.980 --> 00:44:30.480
And it's fascinate to see from his
very early letters to Mrs. Coolidge

00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:34.660
and letters that show his interest
in getting a commission from her.

00:44:34.660 --> 00:44:39.770 position:56%
Then you move through the era of
Copeland planning [inaudible] Spring

00:44:39.770 --> 00:44:42.570
with Martha Graham and Harold
Speevak, the former chief

00:44:42.570 --> 00:44:45.770
for many years and Mrs.
Coolidge who was very,

00:44:45.770 --> 00:44:47.550
very hands on in that commission.

00:44:47.550 --> 00:44:50.740
You move through that and the
time period in which it looks

00:44:50.740 --> 00:44:54.280
like [inaudible] Spring would very
nearly be written for two pianos

00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:57.630
because that's what they
might have been able to score

00:44:57.630 --> 00:45:00.470
for in the timeframe they had.

00:45:00.470 --> 00:45:02.780
We have a huge documentation,
of course,

00:45:02.780 --> 00:45:04.740
for that work in our archives.

00:45:04.740 --> 00:45:08.510
And then at the end of his
career, we released a recording

00:45:08.510 --> 00:45:13.000
of his 81st birthday here
which is on Bridge Records.

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:17.140
And it's charming because he talks
about, again, it's like a view

00:45:17.140 --> 00:45:20.350
into the past through the
viewfinder of a kaleidoscope.

00:45:20.350 --> 00:45:22.050
But back to Nadia Boulanger.

00:45:22.050 --> 00:45:26.510 position:56%
He talks about how in the books he
says everyone thinks I went to Paris

00:45:26.510 --> 00:45:29.440
to study Nadia Boulanger,
I didn't know who she was.

00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:32.820
And he said I didn't
want to tell my folks

00:45:32.820 --> 00:45:34.360
that I was studying with a woman.

00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:36.760
I'm paraphrasing, but
it's very funny.

00:45:36.760 --> 00:45:38.060
And he has the instincts

00:45:38.060 --> 00:45:40.240
of a comedian while
he's doing all of this.

00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:46.080
So I raise Copeland because, again,
it underscores one of the themes

00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:49.880
of my talk which is relationships
throughout these many years we've

00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:51.180
been in business.

00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:55.570
And we want to honor the
Copeland/Graham relationship

00:45:55.570 --> 00:46:01.060
and the path breaking
ballet that they created.

00:46:01.060 --> 00:46:07.360
We will be mounting [inaudible]
Spring again April next year.

00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:10.770
And the Martha Graham Company
will be here for two days.

00:46:10.770 --> 00:46:14.350
But we will also have a
brand new dance commission.

00:46:14.350 --> 00:46:15.960 position:56%
I can't say too much more than that,

00:46:15.960 --> 00:46:20.040
but we're putting the final touches
now to some contracts and so on.

00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:23.060
So it's very exciting.

00:46:23.060 --> 00:46:31.160
I'll just say in wrapping this
up that I asked someone last week

00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:35.360
to give me a two word response to
the idea of the Library series.

00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:39.470
And she said venerable
and adventurous.

00:46:40.610 --> 00:46:44.470
We want to in this coming 90
weeks honor Mrs. Coolidge's

00:46:44.470 --> 00:46:46.190
adventurous spirit.

00:46:46.190 --> 00:46:49.750
One of the most fun things I know
about her is that she spent a lot

00:46:49.750 --> 00:46:52.690
of time in 1920s trying
to find a way

00:46:52.690 --> 00:46:56.480
to bring a [inaudible]
orchestra to the Coolidge.

00:46:58.260 --> 00:47:02.500
Time and space are on their
last legs, I think, she said.

00:47:02.500 --> 00:47:06.850
This is a fascinating comment
in the pre-Internet age.

00:47:06.850 --> 00:47:10.500
And we shall all have
to re-educate our senses

00:47:10.500 --> 00:47:14.880
to interpret a new set
of sensory impressions.

00:47:16.690 --> 00:47:20.870
Today, as I said, she would
be called a visionary.

00:47:20.870 --> 00:47:29.600
She remains startlingly focused
example of someone with instincts

00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:32.010
for presenting great art.

00:47:32.010 --> 00:47:35.120
She stated her goal
as, quote, to serve art

00:47:35.120 --> 00:47:37.680
and through art to serve humanity.

00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:41.270
Following with, quote, the survival

00:47:41.270 --> 00:47:46.220
of the human spirit largely
depends upon its artistic freedom.

00:47:46.220 --> 00:47:50.270
Pointing it especially
in the past month.

00:47:50.270 --> 00:47:54.180
Music is a mechanism
to approach the divine.

00:47:54.180 --> 00:47:56.710
This is a statement
I noted down once

00:47:56.710 --> 00:47:58.460
but have never found the source.

00:47:58.460 --> 00:48:02.320
If you know it or can
find it, let me know.

00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:06.300
However one might define
the concept of the divine,

00:48:06.300 --> 00:48:09.680
I know that as presenters
and audience members,

00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:13.940
we share in making
this approach together.

00:48:13.940 --> 00:48:15.850
We look forward tremendously

00:48:15.850 --> 00:48:20.510
to celebrating the Library's
90th anniversary with you.

00:48:20.510 --> 00:48:25.650
[ Applause ]

00:48:25.650 --> 00:48:29.300
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
