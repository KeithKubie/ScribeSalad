00:22:45.515 --> 00:22:47.390
ADAM GREEN: And so you
mentioned that there's

00:22:47.390 --> 00:22:49.720
a vein of seriousness in there.

00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:52.060
Is this like a "well
guys protest album,"

00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:54.610
or is this collectively you
four like rolling your eyes

00:22:54.610 --> 00:22:57.320
and just being like, all
right, we've got to have fun?

00:22:57.320 --> 00:22:59.403
TYLER STEWART: Well, the
name, also, of the album,

00:22:59.403 --> 00:23:04.310
besides the associated
political stuff, is--

00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:05.571
it's actually true.

00:23:05.571 --> 00:23:06.820
ADAM GREEN: You're fake nudes.

00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:07.420
TYLER STEWART: We're fake nudes.

00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:07.930
We're Barenaked Ladies.

00:23:07.930 --> 00:23:08.830
ADAM GREEN: Most of the time.

00:23:08.830 --> 00:23:11.230
TYLER STEWART: Yeah, well, I
mean, how many times did we

00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:14.740
get asked when we were younger,
"You guys, there's no--

00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:17.075
there's no ladies,
and you're not naked.

00:23:17.075 --> 00:23:17.825
You're four guys."

00:23:17.825 --> 00:23:19.908
ADAM GREEN: This is the
the worst strip club ever.

00:23:19.908 --> 00:23:21.850
TYLER STEWART: Yeah, exactly.

00:23:21.850 --> 00:23:24.790
So we're finally
calling our own bluff

00:23:24.790 --> 00:23:28.300
and saying, "Yeah,
we tricked you."

00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:31.180
ADAM GREEN: 30 years later--
that's a long set-up.

00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:32.740
JIM CREEGGAN: And I think--

00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:34.690
I don't know if--

00:23:34.690 --> 00:23:38.280
the name just kind of
came up when we're 18.

00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:42.760
But Sam the American Eagle
did mention "bare naked"

00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:44.260
in one of his speeches.

00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:45.886
So really it kind of
comes full circle.

00:23:45.886 --> 00:23:47.926
TYLER STEWART: Sam the
American eagle, of course,

00:23:47.926 --> 00:23:50.005
is a popular muppet
character from 1981.

00:23:50.005 --> 00:23:50.505
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:52.514 --> 00:23:54.430
ADAM GREEN: Half of our
employees are like 22.

00:23:54.430 --> 00:23:56.400
So they have no idea
what the muppets are.

00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:56.670
JIM CREEGGAN: All right.

00:23:56.670 --> 00:23:58.391
ADAM GREEN: I do,
but they don't.

00:23:58.391 --> 00:24:00.640
KEVIN HEARN: Adam, Ed suggested
the name of the record

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:03.460
early on into the
recording process.

00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:04.900
And it was just
one of those times

00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:07.460
where it happened
easily and made sense.

00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:12.109
And, yeah, so usually we wait
till after the record is done

00:24:12.109 --> 00:24:13.650
and then figure out
what it's called.

00:24:13.650 --> 00:24:15.035
But this time we do.

00:24:15.035 --> 00:24:16.660
ADAM GREEN: I love
the humorous streak.

00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:18.951
And humor is, in general,
something you guys are really

00:24:18.951 --> 00:24:19.900
well known for.

00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:23.259
Do you think that,
without that, you could

00:24:23.259 --> 00:24:24.550
have lasted as long as you did?

00:24:24.550 --> 00:24:27.919
Like, if you're stage
persona was more serious,

00:24:27.919 --> 00:24:30.460
could you have gone for 30 years
hanging out with each other?

00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:31.960
JIM CREEGGAN: I
don't think we could

00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:34.180
have gone 30 years without
making each other laugh.

00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:37.301
I think that's kind of the
first thing that got us through.

00:24:37.301 --> 00:24:38.800
TYLER STEWART: I'm
going on 29 years

00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:41.110
though of not making these guys
laugh, so just so you know.

00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:43.030
ADAM GREEN: But you keep
trying, and that's what matters.

00:24:43.030 --> 00:24:44.140
TYLER STEWART: Keep
swinging for the fences.

00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:46.264
KEVIN HEARN: The other side
of the coin, of course,

00:24:46.264 --> 00:24:51.020
is, if there weren't good
songs and well-crafted music,

00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:54.340
I think the laughter stuff would
have become quite tiresome.

00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:56.590
TYLER STEWART: I think
the critics across Canada

00:24:56.590 --> 00:25:00.840
and America would be quite
happy if we weren't humorous,

00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:03.850
you know, because you get this,
Canadian joke band, Barenaked

00:25:03.850 --> 00:25:04.870
Ladies.

00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:09.650
We'll let anyone sing the anthem
about the NBA All-Star Game.

00:25:09.650 --> 00:25:13.570
We're known for our humor, but
you also remember the songs.

00:25:13.570 --> 00:25:14.700
We take it very seriously.

00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:19.330
And darn it, we taste good.

00:25:19.330 --> 00:25:22.780
KEVIN HEARN: Tyler acts funny
in public, but he's not funny.

00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:24.880
ADAM GREEN: He's a
moody, serious person.

00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:27.130
ED ROBERTSON: Well, and take
the anthem, for instance.

00:25:27.130 --> 00:25:30.470
When we wrote that, nobody
thought that'd be a hit.

00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:31.402
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:32.417 --> 00:25:34.250
KEVIN HEARN: And They
sing it at every game.

00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:34.990
ED ROBERTSON: Yeah.

00:25:34.990 --> 00:25:35.630
So now they sing it--

00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:36.560
ADAM GREEN: Only
the gold medals.

00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:37.200
ED ROBERTSON: --at
every sporting event.

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:38.590
TYLER STEWART: And when we
changed the lyrics two weeks

00:25:38.590 --> 00:25:39.860
ago, people were really happy.

00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:42.324
ED ROBERTSON: They
were so angry.

00:25:42.324 --> 00:25:43.210
TYLER STEWART: Oh.

00:25:43.210 --> 00:25:45.390
ED ROBERTSON: I hate when
things are inclusive.

00:25:45.390 --> 00:25:47.770
Stop it!

00:25:47.770 --> 00:25:50.280
TYLER STEWART: And I'm going
home to talk to thy sons.

00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:51.050
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:51.369 --> 00:25:53.410
ADAM GREEN: I will write
a strongly worded letter

00:25:53.410 --> 00:25:54.330
to someone about this--

00:25:54.330 --> 00:25:55.096
TYLER STEWART: Thy sons.

00:25:55.096 --> 00:25:56.920
ED ROBERTSON: It's
amazing how angry people

00:25:56.920 --> 00:26:01.420
were that we sang
Canada's official anthem

00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:03.190
at the All-Star game.

00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:04.270
People were angry.

00:26:04.270 --> 00:26:07.920
If you're watching right now and
you're angry, you're an idiot.

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:08.788
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:11.795
An idiot.

00:26:11.795 --> 00:26:16.480
A stone, cold idiot.

00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:21.650
JIM CREEGGAN: The response
being, "No, you're an idiot."

00:26:21.650 --> 00:26:23.690
ADAM GREEN: And probably
those words exactly.

00:26:23.690 --> 00:26:26.069
JIM CREEGGAN: Back and
forth and back and forth.

00:26:26.069 --> 00:26:28.610
ADAM GREEN: So controversy is
something you guys are actually

00:26:28.610 --> 00:26:30.860
like not at all strangers to.

00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:32.900
Some of your big break
comes back to controversy

00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:36.634
over your name in the original
show at Mel Lastman's square.

00:26:36.634 --> 00:26:39.050
ED ROBERTSON: It was actually
at Nathan Phillips' Square--

00:26:39.050 --> 00:26:41.150
just down the street from here.

00:26:41.150 --> 00:26:44.320
We were booked to play the
New Year's Eve show, which

00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:46.820
was a city-sponsored event.

00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:52.490
And the name Robertson
was considered offensive

00:26:52.490 --> 00:26:53.339
at the time.

00:26:53.339 --> 00:26:54.380
ADAM GREEN: I'm offended.

00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:56.100
ED ROBERTSON: And
so, I guess there

00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:58.340
was a lot of
anti-Scottish sentiment

00:26:58.340 --> 00:27:01.246
at that time in the early '90s.

00:27:01.246 --> 00:27:04.250
ADAM GREEN: It's a dark period
in our nation's history.

00:27:04.250 --> 00:27:07.590
ED ROBERTSON: You're not
really the son of Robert.

00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:10.080
ADAM GREEN: Dad's name is Jim.

00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:12.170
ED ROBERTSON: No, yeah.

00:27:12.170 --> 00:27:18.380
So we were asked to drop out
of the gig, which we did.

00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:19.940
And we just went
and did another gig.

00:27:19.940 --> 00:27:23.960
And then we got really
lucky about a week later.

00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:27.380
Nothing else happened
in the world,

00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:29.960
and so somebody
reported this story.

00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:33.620
It actually was a
week after New Year's.

00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:35.990
And Jim Slotek, I
think, from The Sun.

00:27:35.990 --> 00:27:37.850
JIM CREEGGAN: The Sun first.

00:27:37.850 --> 00:27:41.540
ED ROBERTSON: And then from
that, other media outlets

00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:42.110
picked it up.

00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:43.526
And it ended up
on the front cover

00:27:43.526 --> 00:27:45.420
of The Star, the national paper.

00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:48.410
So we, as a little
band from Toronto,

00:27:48.410 --> 00:27:50.870
went from selling
400 cassettes a week

00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:53.990
to selling 14,000
cassettes a week.

00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:55.070
Yes, cassettes.

00:27:55.070 --> 00:27:55.918
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:56.726 --> 00:27:58.850
TYLER STEWART: A cassette
is a small plastic device

00:27:58.850 --> 00:27:59.420
that housed--

00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:00.320
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:03.220
--cellulose tape.

00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:05.427
JIM CREEGGAN: And it rewinds
when you put your pen

00:28:05.427 --> 00:28:06.260
in one of the holes.

00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:07.950
TYLER STEWART: Your pen.

00:28:07.950 --> 00:28:12.350
When you put your pen in it.

00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:16.434
ADAM GREEN: Very
important to note that.

00:28:16.434 --> 00:28:17.850
Actually, that
brings up something

00:28:17.850 --> 00:28:19.710
that I do want to talk
to you guys about.

00:28:19.710 --> 00:28:23.010
You've been around since
the days of cassettes.

00:28:23.010 --> 00:28:28.050
Then you saw music
media change drastically

00:28:28.050 --> 00:28:30.870
from cassettes, where you
got your start, and then CDs.

00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:33.450
You actually released
an album on USB stick.

00:28:33.450 --> 00:28:34.842
How cool is that?

00:28:34.842 --> 00:28:35.550
ED ROBERTSON: Not

00:28:35.550 --> 00:28:37.880
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:39.870
TYLER STEWART: Not anymore.

00:28:39.870 --> 00:28:43.150
ADAM GREEN: Yeah,
because it was last week.

00:28:43.150 --> 00:28:45.940
But how does the
medium change the way

00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:48.130
you guys think about
an album, or does it?

00:28:48.130 --> 00:28:50.110
Do you write the
same whether it's

00:28:50.110 --> 00:28:52.090
going to be streamed
or someone's

00:28:52.090 --> 00:28:54.430
going to like buy a physical
medium and hold it in

00:28:54.430 --> 00:28:55.990
and, you know, treasure it?

00:28:55.990 --> 00:29:02.230
ED ROBERTSON: Yeah, we certainly
don't make music thinking

00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:06.160
about how people are
going to get it, you know?

00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:09.700
We write songs because we're
trying to communicate ideas,

00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:11.740
we're trying to
express something.

00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:14.350
But the landscape has
so radically changed

00:29:14.350 --> 00:29:22.090
from a time when people used
to line up to buy vinyl or a CD

00:29:22.090 --> 00:29:27.340
to a time when, a month before
we've released the record,

00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:29.560
most people already
have it, because it

00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:31.210
was leaked at some point.

00:29:31.210 --> 00:29:36.260
And digitally it's gone
all over the place.

00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:40.130
I love the one side of
that in that, as a music

00:29:40.130 --> 00:29:45.410
fan and a consumer with
a voracious appetite

00:29:45.410 --> 00:29:49.400
for new music, I'm always
checking stuff out,

00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:51.350
streaming it, going to
the website of a band,

00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:54.110
downloading stuff.

00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:55.760
I love the convenience of it.

00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:59.090
I love being able to have my
music library in my pocket

00:29:59.090 --> 00:30:00.470
wherever I go.

00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:02.300
That's awesome.

00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:06.020
But it's made it
tough as artists,

00:30:06.020 --> 00:30:11.960
because that thing we do no
longer has a perceived value,

00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:18.040
even though we all have these
fantastic devices ostensibly

00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:19.580
for media.

00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:21.880
I mean, I know we use them
for a lot of communication,

00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:22.480
but a lot of--

00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:24.690
ADAM GREEN: Mostly looking
at cat pictures, I think.

00:30:24.690 --> 00:30:26.398
ED ROBERTSON: But a
lot of what people do

00:30:26.398 --> 00:30:28.300
is watch movies and
listen to music.

00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:30.880
And there is way more
people listening to music

00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:33.200
now than ever in history.

00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:36.400
But it's a lot harder to
make a living as a musician.

00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:37.840
We're lucky.

00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:40.690
I say this on behalf
of younger acts.

00:30:40.690 --> 00:30:43.271
We were at our height
when the record industry

00:30:43.271 --> 00:30:44.020
was at its height.

00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:45.490
So we sold a ton of records.

00:30:45.490 --> 00:30:47.170
And we built a huge base.

00:30:47.170 --> 00:30:50.320
So now every year, we
can go out and tour.

00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:54.916
And we play for 100,000
people every summer

00:30:54.916 --> 00:30:56.290
in a matter of a
couple of weeks.

00:30:56.290 --> 00:30:58.250
So we're fine.

00:30:58.250 --> 00:31:01.741
But it would be really tough to
try and start out as an artist

00:31:01.741 --> 00:31:02.240
right now.

00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:07.270
You would have to find all
kinds of alternate ways

00:31:07.270 --> 00:31:09.190
to make it work.

00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:12.910
So I envy the tools that
emerging artists have

00:31:12.910 --> 00:31:18.460
at their fingertips, whether
that be a very amazing home

00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:22.027
studio that's included
in your laptop.

00:31:22.027 --> 00:31:24.360
TYLER STEWART: That guys got
a great studio right there.

00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:26.260
ED ROBERTSON: Yeah, right there.

00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:28.570
Everything you need to
make a high-quality record

00:31:28.570 --> 00:31:29.620
is sitting on your lap.

00:31:29.620 --> 00:31:33.440
KEVIN HEARN: He's making
it right now with his mind.

00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:35.710
ED ROBERTSON: But, you
know, the flip side of that

00:31:35.710 --> 00:31:38.560
is there's so much
noise that it's really

00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:40.900
tough to cut through all that.

00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:43.840
ADAM GREEN: Now you mentioned
that you came to your peak

00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:45.399
when the industry
was at its peak.

00:31:45.399 --> 00:31:47.440
But it wasn't always
friendly to you guys, right?

00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:49.660
Like, you got rejected
by every label.

00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:52.210
I don't want to like
drag up old wounds.

00:31:52.210 --> 00:31:57.070
But you got a lot of nos, and
you hustled your own start

00:31:57.070 --> 00:32:01.150
selling your own tapes off
the stage and to your friends.

00:32:01.150 --> 00:32:03.060
KEVIN HEARN: We were
mentioning humor before.

00:32:03.060 --> 00:32:05.260
And the humor actually
made it challenging

00:32:05.260 --> 00:32:08.440
for us to get support
from radio stations,

00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:12.010
especially in the USA,
because it was easy for them

00:32:12.010 --> 00:32:15.200
to write us off as
a novelty group.

00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:16.690
So we had to keep
going down there.

00:32:16.690 --> 00:32:21.430
I guess we were down there
six, seven months a year

00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:22.480
building the audience.

00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:24.850
Every time we went back,
we'd go from a club, then

00:32:24.850 --> 00:32:27.910
a bigger club, than the
next time the theater.

00:32:27.910 --> 00:32:31.870
Eventually, the radio
stations came onboard.

00:32:31.870 --> 00:32:35.110
ED ROBERTSON: We were
selling out arenas in America

00:32:35.110 --> 00:32:36.400
before Stunt came out.

00:32:39.010 --> 00:32:41.050
The band had done
so much like work.

00:32:41.050 --> 00:32:44.980
It's like we built a following
one person at a time,

00:32:44.980 --> 00:32:47.860
because we really didn't
have any kind of major media

00:32:47.860 --> 00:32:52.420
support or even label support
until after Rock Spectac.

00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:55.300
Then I think, at that
point, we had actually

00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:58.530
played for everyone in the
record company at some point.

00:32:58.530 --> 00:32:59.980
And they'd all gotten onboard.

00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:03.216
And we became like the
darling of the label.

00:33:03.216 --> 00:33:05.590
Everybody liked us, but we
hadn't really gotten anywhere.

00:33:05.590 --> 00:33:08.080
So the company really
rallied behind us.

00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:12.850
And then Stunt came out and
debuted at number two or three

00:33:12.850 --> 00:33:15.880
in America, and
everything changed.

00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:19.122
KEVIN HEARN: And now we're
rereleasing Stunt on vinyl--

00:33:19.122 --> 00:33:20.830
TYLER STEWART: Hoping
for the same thing.

00:33:20.830 --> 00:33:21.490
KEVIN HEARN: It's never--

00:33:21.490 --> 00:33:21.990
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:27.070
It's never been on vinyl
before, because vinyl went away

00:33:27.070 --> 00:33:28.894
for a while.

00:33:28.894 --> 00:33:30.310
ADAM GREEN: So why
do you think it

00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:32.470
is that the industry thought
for so long you can't

00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:35.170
be funny and be a musician?

00:33:35.170 --> 00:33:40.662
ED ROBERTSON: Well,
I think the Beatles--

00:33:40.662 --> 00:33:41.620
ADAM GREEN: That's why?

00:33:41.620 --> 00:33:45.490
ED ROBERTSON: --got them really
sick of having humor in music.

00:33:45.490 --> 00:33:47.740
ADAM GREEN: These guys hold
a grudge for a long time.

00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:50.200
TYLER STEWART: Well, they hated
the Beastie Boys and Beck.

00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:52.330
I mean, they just
didn't like them.

00:33:52.330 --> 00:33:54.270
ED ROBERTSON: I don't know why.

00:33:54.270 --> 00:33:57.520
I think people were looking
for a reason to dismiss us.

00:33:57.520 --> 00:33:59.297
And humor was the
reason they chose.

00:33:59.297 --> 00:34:00.130
ADAM GREEN: Got you.

00:34:00.130 --> 00:34:01.150
TYLER STEWART: It was either
the humor or the shorts

00:34:01.150 --> 00:34:02.410
we wore for 10 years.

00:34:02.410 --> 00:34:02.969
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:02.969 --> 00:34:04.802
ADAM GREEN: It's a
pants-mandatory mandatory

00:34:04.802 --> 00:34:05.301
industry.

00:34:05.301 --> 00:34:07.840
TYLER STEWART: Yeah,
yeah, mandatory pants--

00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:09.010
things start to look up.

00:34:09.010 --> 00:34:11.350
ADAM GREEN: I understand.

00:34:11.350 --> 00:34:14.860
ED ROBERTSON: And to be
fair, we were idiots.

00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:19.270
We never once went into a radio
station or a television show

00:34:19.270 --> 00:34:20.320
or anything we did.

00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:23.232
We were always idiots, because
we were having a great time,

00:34:23.232 --> 00:34:24.440
and we were just being silly.

00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:27.560
And I don't think we
did ourselves any favors

00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:29.690
of trying to go, "Oh, no,
but check out the record.

00:34:29.690 --> 00:34:32.469
There's a lot of really serious
material on the record."

00:34:32.469 --> 00:34:34.540
I don't blame people for
having written us off,

00:34:34.540 --> 00:34:36.520
because we sort of
made them write us off.

00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:38.080
ADAM GREEN: You were just like,
here's another microphone,

00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:38.830
let's have fun?

00:34:38.830 --> 00:34:39.790
ED ROBERTSON: Yeah.

00:34:39.790 --> 00:34:41.920
TYLER STEWART: Be yourself
at all costs kind of.

00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:43.389
We were those kind of guys.

00:34:43.389 --> 00:34:47.770
And we weren't interested in
putting a facade on or being

00:34:47.770 --> 00:34:49.246
the coolest guys
in the room or--

00:34:49.246 --> 00:34:50.620
KEVIN HEARN: Even
though we were.

00:34:50.620 --> 00:34:52.560
TYLER STEWART: Yeah.

00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:53.949
Barely.

00:34:53.949 --> 00:34:56.454
Still are.

00:34:56.454 --> 00:34:58.870
ADAM GREEN: Did that inform
how you guys would, let's say,

00:34:58.870 --> 00:35:02.530
give advice to a young artist
about building their career

00:35:02.530 --> 00:35:03.220
in this--

00:35:03.220 --> 00:35:05.710
it's a very different
industry, but you guys

00:35:05.710 --> 00:35:08.260
struggled to build your
success and had this be

00:35:08.260 --> 00:35:09.684
yourself at all costs attitude.

00:35:09.684 --> 00:35:11.350
JIM CREEGGAN: Well,
I think playing live

00:35:11.350 --> 00:35:15.010
was the biggest thing that
we still carry through.

00:35:15.010 --> 00:35:18.590
And I think that's one thing
that a young artist should

00:35:18.590 --> 00:35:21.116
always do is to just keep--

00:35:21.116 --> 00:35:24.930
really be good to each
other if you're a band

00:35:24.930 --> 00:35:28.947
and carry through
and rub each other.

00:35:28.947 --> 00:35:30.780
ADAM GREEN: Here's where
the name came from.

00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:34.460
JIM CREEGGAN: Yeah, and I
think, even more now than ever,

00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:39.350
playing live and being
present to your friends

00:35:39.350 --> 00:35:40.890
is more important.

00:35:40.890 --> 00:35:42.920
And it's the thing that
lasts through as things

00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:44.342
change technologically and--

00:35:44.342 --> 00:35:46.050
TYLER STEWART: Something
you can control.

00:35:46.050 --> 00:35:48.980
The only thing we ever
really control in our career

00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:51.000
is what kind of
a show we put on.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:54.320
I mean, you were in here in
this room when we played music.

00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:57.680
And it sounded pretty
good, and you liked it.

00:35:57.680 --> 00:36:00.270
That's what happens
everywhere we play.

00:36:00.270 --> 00:36:03.620
So if you have that
up your sleeve,

00:36:03.620 --> 00:36:05.960
it's a lot easier than
trying to sell an image

00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:08.600
or an idea or even a record.

00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:10.442
KEVIN HEARN: You did like it?

00:36:10.442 --> 00:36:12.050
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:12.050 --> 00:36:13.970
JIM CREEGGAN: OK, just checking.

00:36:13.970 --> 00:36:17.180
I don't want to take
Tyler's word for it.

00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:19.410
ED ROBERTSON: Here's
another secret about music

00:36:19.410 --> 00:36:25.610
is, yes, it's difficult
to become a big success

00:36:25.610 --> 00:36:27.290
in the music industry.

00:36:27.290 --> 00:36:32.120
But it doesn't matter, because
it's really fun to make music.

00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:36.200
And I would be
making music still

00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:40.070
whether I was in this
successful rock band

00:36:40.070 --> 00:36:42.470
or not, because we all
make music because it's

00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:43.620
what we love to do.

00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:44.330
It's our passion.

00:36:44.330 --> 00:36:46.520
And you can follow that passion.

00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:49.250
If you want to pursue
music, you can do that.

00:36:49.250 --> 00:36:52.716
At some point, maybe you
have to reassess and--

00:36:52.716 --> 00:36:54.590
ADAM GREEN: Maybe you
have to get a real job,

00:36:54.590 --> 00:36:55.460
but you can do it on the side.

00:36:55.460 --> 00:36:56.293
ED ROBERTSON: Maybe.

00:36:56.293 --> 00:37:01.070
But when I talk to kids who
are trying to make a go of it

00:37:01.070 --> 00:37:04.550
as a band, I never
say, well, it's tough,

00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:06.350
so have something
to fall back on.

00:37:06.350 --> 00:37:07.910
I would never say that.

00:37:07.910 --> 00:37:09.397
I would say, it's
tough, go for it.

00:37:09.397 --> 00:37:10.730
ADAM GREEN: Yeah, make a plan A.

00:37:10.730 --> 00:37:11.690
ED ROBERTSON: Go for
it with everything,

00:37:11.690 --> 00:37:14.720
because it's the most rewarding
thing you could ever do.

00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:20.080
But set yourself a horizon
and reassess at some point.

00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:21.580
TYLER STEWART:
You're a little more.

00:37:21.580 --> 00:37:23.538
You're a little more
tongue in cheek than that.

00:37:23.538 --> 00:37:25.430
Usually you say,
"Yeah, don't have

00:37:25.430 --> 00:37:26.630
something to fall back on."

00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:28.160
ED ROBERTSON: I do,
and I say, "Drop

00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:31.160
out of school immediately,
because I did,

00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:32.510
and I'm a millionaire."

00:37:32.510 --> 00:37:33.842
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:38.624
ADAM GREEN: Life advice
from Ed Robertson.

00:37:38.624 --> 00:37:40.040
ED ROBERTSON:
Especially if you're

00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:42.590
mediocre on your
instrument like I am.

00:37:42.590 --> 00:37:43.538
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:45.620 --> 00:37:48.470
TYLER STEWART: This is like,
never see a hot dog is made.

00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:49.580
This is behind the scenes.

00:37:49.580 --> 00:37:51.010
This behind the music.

00:37:51.010 --> 00:37:52.284
Don't give it all away, man.

00:37:52.284 --> 00:37:54.200
ED ROBERTSON: I've seen
how hot dogs are made.

00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:55.610
I've been in the factory.

00:37:55.610 --> 00:37:56.630
Still love hot dogs.

00:37:56.630 --> 00:37:57.602
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:59.060 --> 00:38:01.830
ADAM GREEN: So this whole
idea of do what you love,

00:38:01.830 --> 00:38:03.080
you'll never work another day.

00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:04.670
If you had to
though, do you guys

00:38:04.670 --> 00:38:06.410
think you could
work like a desk job

00:38:06.410 --> 00:38:07.910
and come and be
like office schmuck?

00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:08.970
TYLER STEWART: Fuck no.

00:38:08.970 --> 00:38:09.483
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:10.021 --> 00:38:12.270
ADAM GREEN: You're totally
unemployable at this point.

00:38:12.270 --> 00:38:13.460
TYLER STEWART: Absolutely.

00:38:13.460 --> 00:38:15.459
JIM CREEGGAN: I spent a
lot of time volunteering

00:38:15.459 --> 00:38:16.370
at my local school.

00:38:16.370 --> 00:38:20.310
And I found I had to learn
a new job every time.

00:38:20.310 --> 00:38:24.320
Like, I had to learn how to
make 800 pancakes one morning,

00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:25.765
400 sausages.

00:38:25.765 --> 00:38:27.890
ED ROBERTSON: That's the
same job technically, Jim.

00:38:27.890 --> 00:38:29.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:29.950
That's flipping.

00:38:29.950 --> 00:38:31.450
JIM CREEGGAN:
Gardening, gardening--

00:38:31.450 --> 00:38:32.759
I had to learn how to garden.

00:38:32.759 --> 00:38:33.300
I don't know.

00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:37.500
I feel like I will
do what I need to do.

00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:39.116
I think that as a musician--

00:38:39.116 --> 00:38:40.490
ADAM GREEN: So
Jim is employable.

00:38:40.490 --> 00:38:41.300
JIM CREEGGAN: What's that?

00:38:41.300 --> 00:38:42.045
ADAM GREEN: Jim is employable.

00:38:42.045 --> 00:38:42.580
TYLER STEWART: He's the
only employable guy.

00:38:42.580 --> 00:38:43.770
JIM CREEGGAN: I'm just
putting myself out there.

00:38:43.770 --> 00:38:44.670
ED ROBERTSON: Jim
would've been fine.

00:38:44.670 --> 00:38:47.030
ADAM GREEN: The rest of you--
he stuck around for your sake.

00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:48.090
JIM CREEGGAN: You guys
want pancakes, gardening--

00:38:48.090 --> 00:38:49.465
KEVIN HEARN: Jim,
why do you feel

00:38:49.465 --> 00:38:51.200
you're the right
person for those jobs?

00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:51.700
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:54.412 --> 00:38:55.370
JIM CREEGGAN: I think--

00:38:55.370 --> 00:38:58.700
ED ROBERTSON: What are your
strengths and weaknesses?

00:38:58.700 --> 00:39:00.884
JIM CREEGGAN: I just
think, when you play music,

00:39:00.884 --> 00:39:02.300
one thing that
happens is that you

00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:04.130
get to work with other people.

00:39:04.130 --> 00:39:05.840
And you have to
accomplish something.

00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:09.690
And you have to
answer to an audience.

00:39:09.690 --> 00:39:12.879
And I think that's just good
training for anything really.

00:39:12.879 --> 00:39:14.420
TYLER STEWART: It's
like accountancy.

00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:15.500
ADAM GREEN: Like in
this moment where

00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:17.070
I think we should
answer to the audience.

00:39:17.070 --> 00:39:17.819
TYLER STEWART: Oh.

00:39:17.819 --> 00:39:18.445
Hi.

00:39:18.445 --> 00:39:20.130
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:39:20.130 --> 00:39:23.390
First of all, my father-in-law
from Musselburgh, Scotland

00:39:23.390 --> 00:39:25.380
says hello.

00:39:25.380 --> 00:39:26.630
TYLER STEWART: From what town?

00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:27.790
AUDIENCE: Musselburgh,
just out--

00:39:27.790 --> 00:39:28.914
TYLER STEWART: Musselburgh!

00:39:28.914 --> 00:39:30.160
Everyone's got muscles!

00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:30.659
Right?

00:39:30.659 --> 00:39:32.825
You've got strong people
over there in Musselburgh.

00:39:32.825 --> 00:39:36.830
I'm from a fat town.

00:39:36.830 --> 00:39:38.580
It's just to the
south of that place.

00:39:38.580 --> 00:39:39.526
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:39.526 --> 00:39:41.692
AUDIENCE: You reacted exactly
how I hoped you would.

00:39:41.692 --> 00:39:42.860
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:42.860 --> 00:39:45.110
ED ROBERTSON: He's going to
wonder why you're speaking

00:39:45.110 --> 00:39:46.820
to him with a Pakistani accent.

00:39:46.820 --> 00:39:47.702
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:49.872 --> 00:39:51.580
Didn't she tell them
I was from Scotland?

00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:54.640
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:57.050
TYLER STEWART: They can'nae
speak in [INAUDIBLE]..

00:39:57.050 --> 00:39:58.490
ADAM GREEN: The Scottish
leg of your next tour

00:39:58.490 --> 00:39:59.270
has being canceled.

00:39:59.270 --> 00:40:00.728
TYLER STEWART: And
you were saying?

00:40:00.728 --> 00:40:03.440
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
so, hello to Ian.

00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:04.910
The other question--
so we put out

00:40:04.910 --> 00:40:07.035
a Dory, which is where
people can submit questions.

00:40:07.035 --> 00:40:10.110
And we had a couple of questions
about music recommendations.

00:40:10.110 --> 00:40:12.112
So we have a lot of
expats in this office.

00:40:12.112 --> 00:40:13.820
Raise your hand if
you're not from Canada

00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:15.890
or didn't grow up
with Barenaked Ladies.

00:40:15.890 --> 00:40:18.440
So lots of folks who are
new to Canadian music.

00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:20.930
So including Barenaked
Ladies, if you

00:40:20.930 --> 00:40:24.860
could give a new Canadian
a must-know list of music,

00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:25.760
what would that be?

00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:28.765
ED ROBERTSON: Are we talking
current or of all time?

00:40:28.765 --> 00:40:29.640
AUDIENCE: Everything.

00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:32.040
TYLER STEWART: I'll go
Bruce Cockburn first.

00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:33.330
It's not Bruce Cockburn.

00:40:33.330 --> 00:40:36.020
And that's the first
thing you've got to know.

00:40:36.020 --> 00:40:38.810
My wife-- she's from
the US-- she came up,

00:40:38.810 --> 00:40:41.630
and she says, "How
come everybody

00:40:41.630 --> 00:40:43.870
calls them Bruce Cockburn?

00:40:43.870 --> 00:40:45.246
It's spelled Bruce Cockburn."

00:40:45.246 --> 00:40:46.620
ED ROBERTSON: It's
a silent "ck."

00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:52.260
JIM CREEGGAN: Anyways,
that's a little inside story

00:40:52.260 --> 00:40:53.360
for new Canadians.

00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:54.803
It's Cockburn.

00:40:54.803 --> 00:40:57.440
He's one of our
favorite musicians.

00:40:57.440 --> 00:41:00.170
ED ROBERTSON: Joni
Mitchell, I'd say.

00:41:00.170 --> 00:41:02.870
KEVIN HEARN: I'd recommend
an album called "Coke Machine

00:41:02.870 --> 00:41:04.902
Glow" by Gord Downie.

00:41:04.902 --> 00:41:06.110
TYLER STEWART: Yes, for sure.

00:41:06.110 --> 00:41:10.850
I would say the second Sloan
album, "Twice Removed,"

00:41:10.850 --> 00:41:12.980
is a good record.

00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:17.050
I would say Rush.

00:41:17.050 --> 00:41:18.770
But if you're not
from Canada, you

00:41:18.770 --> 00:41:20.570
know who Rush is really, right?

00:41:20.570 --> 00:41:22.730
So we should be
going a little more--

00:41:22.730 --> 00:41:26.480
KEVIN HEARN: Our Johnny Cash,
who would be Stompin' Tom

00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:27.007
Connors--

00:41:27.007 --> 00:41:28.340
TYLER STEWART: Yeah, definitely.

00:41:28.340 --> 00:41:31.725
KEVIN HEARN: --that would
be a good Canadian choice.

00:41:31.725 --> 00:41:33.350
ED ROBERTSON: Or
Gordon Lightfoot, man.

00:41:33.350 --> 00:41:34.220
KEVIN HEARN: Gordon Lightfoot.

00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:35.420
ED ROBERTSON: Listen to
some Gordon Lightfoot--

00:41:35.420 --> 00:41:36.027
"Gord's Gold."

00:41:36.027 --> 00:41:36.860
TYLER STEWART: Yeah.

00:41:36.860 --> 00:41:39.560
KEVIN HEARN: Bob Dylan has often
said that Gordon Lightfoot is

00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:41.450
his favorite songwriter.

00:41:41.450 --> 00:41:42.770
TYLER STEWART: Sarah Harmer--

00:41:42.770 --> 00:41:43.560
check her out.

00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:46.180
She's amazing.

00:41:46.180 --> 00:41:47.930
ED ROBERTSON: "Little
Fire," that record--

00:41:47.930 --> 00:41:48.540
is what it's called?

00:41:48.540 --> 00:41:49.090
TYLER STEWART: "Oh Little Fire."

00:41:49.090 --> 00:41:49.910
ED ROBERTSON: "Old Little Fire."

00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:50.870
TYLER STEWART: Sarah McLachlan.

00:41:50.870 --> 00:41:51.470
There you go.

00:41:51.470 --> 00:41:52.440
She's great too.

00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:53.048
JIM CREEGGAN: She's great too.

00:41:53.048 --> 00:41:53.904
TYLER STEWART: All the Sarahs.

00:41:53.904 --> 00:41:54.404
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:55.415 --> 00:41:56.820
Sarah, Stills, and Nash--

00:41:56.820 --> 00:42:00.014
they're like this super trio.

00:42:00.014 --> 00:42:01.680
ED ROBERTSON: For
modern Canadian music,

00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:05.000
listen to Bahamas,
listen to Alan Doyle,

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:07.909
listen to Donovan Woods.

00:42:07.909 --> 00:42:09.200
TYLER STEWART: City and Colour.

00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:12.680
ED ROBERTSON: City
and Colour, for sure.

00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:14.580
KEVIN HEARN: Skydiggers'
new record is nice.

00:42:14.580 --> 00:42:16.520
JIM CREEGGAN: Yeah, Feist.

00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:17.100
Leslie Feist.

00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:17.660
KEVIN HEARN: Metric.

00:42:17.660 --> 00:42:18.576
TYLER STEWART: Metric.

00:42:18.576 --> 00:42:21.470
Yeah, check the
Broken Social Scene.

00:42:21.470 --> 00:42:23.030
And finally, the Beatles.

00:42:23.030 --> 00:42:23.914
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:27.290
ED ROBERTSON: They're
from Omemee, Ontario.

00:42:27.290 --> 00:42:28.274
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:32.600
Or Liverpool, Nova Scotia.

00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:35.030
KEVIN HEARN: Thanks
for the question.

00:42:35.030 --> 00:42:36.780
ED ROBERTSON: That's
all we have time for.

00:42:36.780 --> 00:42:37.870
Adam, thank you.

00:42:37.870 --> 00:42:38.494
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:38.494 --> 00:42:39.910
ADAM GREEN: Open
the Pandora's box

00:42:39.910 --> 00:42:41.410
of musicians'
favorite musicians.

00:42:41.410 --> 00:42:43.860
We could be here for eons.

00:42:43.860 --> 00:42:46.500
TYLER STEWART: I'd
rather open a--

00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:49.842
what's that small thing
called you talk to?

00:42:49.842 --> 00:42:50.800
JIM CREEGGAN: A cookie?

00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:51.299
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:58.050
TYLER STEWART: I'd rather
open a Google Home Box.

00:42:58.050 --> 00:43:00.760
I'm just trying to be
brand friendly and shit.

00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:01.561
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:01.561 --> 00:43:02.060
Jesus.

00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:08.970
Corporatism is my first
foot through the door.

00:43:08.970 --> 00:43:11.070
ADAM GREEN: Excellent
corporate sponsors.

00:43:11.070 --> 00:43:13.860
So you guys have done--
is it-- like 1,500 shows

00:43:13.860 --> 00:43:15.030
over the years?

00:43:15.030 --> 00:43:17.270
ED ROBERTSON: We've done
1,500 shows this year.

00:43:17.270 --> 00:43:18.030
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:18.030 --> 00:43:20.409
ADAM GREEN: 1,501 now.

00:43:20.409 --> 00:43:22.200
I would assume, at this
point, you guys all

00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:24.360
have like a PhD in hotel stays.

00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:28.080
So I want to know each of
your Barenaked Ladies hotel

00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:30.130
stay top tip for all
the business travelers.

00:43:30.130 --> 00:43:33.845
ED ROBERTSON: OK, here, this
is honestly my top hotel tip.

00:43:33.845 --> 00:43:36.960
It doesn't matter what
city you're going to

00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:38.970
or the reason
you're going there.

00:43:38.970 --> 00:43:42.000
Get out of the hotel.

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:46.830
Eating at a hotel restaurant,
no matter how spectacular,

00:43:46.830 --> 00:43:47.732
is a failure.

00:43:47.732 --> 00:43:48.232
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:49.650 --> 00:43:55.690
When you get into a town,
google best restaurant--

00:43:55.690 --> 00:43:58.680
this is what I do in every town
regardless of how many times

00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:00.250
I've been there.

00:44:00.250 --> 00:44:05.650
I google "top five farm
to table Minneapolis."

00:44:05.650 --> 00:44:08.960
And then I look at the reviews,
because the reviews are always

00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:10.480
manipulated.

00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:13.150
So I look for those.

00:44:13.150 --> 00:44:16.880
And I figure it out, and I text
all these guys and say, "Hey,

00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:19.490
I've got a reservation
four tonight at this place.

00:44:19.490 --> 00:44:21.141
This is what it's called.

00:44:21.141 --> 00:44:22.640
Let me know if you
want to join me."

00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:27.490
And then I also google
"best coffee roastery."

00:44:27.490 --> 00:44:30.580
And so you have to
do that in every--

00:44:30.580 --> 00:44:32.770
it doesn't matter
how tired you are.

00:44:32.770 --> 00:44:35.710
It doesn't matter how well
you think you know the city.

00:44:35.710 --> 00:44:39.460
It is a failure to stay
in your hotel room.

00:44:39.460 --> 00:44:42.290
Even if you have a
ton of work to do,

00:44:42.290 --> 00:44:44.660
google what is cool around you.

00:44:44.660 --> 00:44:47.799
Get out and see it and
do it and then come back

00:44:47.799 --> 00:44:48.590
to your hotel room.

00:44:48.590 --> 00:44:50.510
Eating in the
hotel is a failure.

00:44:50.510 --> 00:44:51.801
JIM CREEGGAN: That's what I do.

00:44:51.801 --> 00:44:54.800
Speaking of Google Maps,
it changed the way I tour.

00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:56.690
So what I'll do is
I'll look, and I'll

00:44:56.690 --> 00:44:59.270
find this the
closest bike lane--

00:44:59.270 --> 00:45:02.210
you know, on Google Maps,
you can find the bike lane--

00:45:02.210 --> 00:45:03.470
and then I just go there.

00:45:03.470 --> 00:45:05.690
And I get to walk
through the city.

00:45:05.690 --> 00:45:08.810
And it changed the way I tour,
because usually I get stuck,

00:45:08.810 --> 00:45:10.850
and I don't know where I'd be.

00:45:10.850 --> 00:45:14.937
TYLER STEWART: Cyclists
everywhere hate Jim Creeggan.

00:45:14.937 --> 00:45:17.270
ADAM GREEN: Dragging his
double bass down the bike lane.

00:45:17.270 --> 00:45:18.200
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:25.261
TYLER STEWART: After you do
what Ed said and get out,

00:45:25.261 --> 00:45:26.510
here's something you don't do.

00:45:26.510 --> 00:45:28.010
Don't come back to
your hotel room,

00:45:28.010 --> 00:45:31.610
strip naked, roll around,
and lick the bed spread.

00:45:31.610 --> 00:45:33.260
Don't do that.

00:45:33.260 --> 00:45:35.460
ED ROBERTSON: Huge
mistake we made early on.

00:45:35.460 --> 00:45:36.140
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:36.140 --> 00:45:36.974
We were always sick.

00:45:36.974 --> 00:45:38.640
TYLER STEWART: Yeah,
we were sick a lot.

00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:39.580
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:42.980 --> 00:45:44.626
ADAM GREEN: Kevin?

00:45:44.626 --> 00:45:45.542
KEVIN HEARN: I'm good.

00:45:45.542 --> 00:45:46.346
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:48.034 --> 00:45:49.450
ED ROBERTSON: So
much comedy gold,

00:45:49.450 --> 00:45:51.930
he doesn't want to
wade into these waters.

00:45:51.930 --> 00:45:53.900
It's shark infested.

00:45:53.900 --> 00:45:56.240
KEVIN HEARN: I was going
to say, Ed texts us,

00:45:56.240 --> 00:45:59.247
and then that's when
we go and rob his room.

00:45:59.247 --> 00:46:00.221
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:02.660 --> 00:46:05.164
ADAM GREEN: And do terrible
things to his bedspread

00:46:05.164 --> 00:46:06.080
and then go to dinner.

00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:08.250
It's amazing.

00:46:08.250 --> 00:46:12.570
So you guys are being inducted
into the Canadian Music

00:46:12.570 --> 00:46:14.100
Hall of Fame this year.

00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:14.890
Huge milestone.

00:46:14.890 --> 00:46:17.728
[APPLAUSE]

00:46:21.050 --> 00:46:23.390
Are there any mixed
emotions about that,

00:46:23.390 --> 00:46:25.220
like thinking that's
the kind of thing

00:46:25.220 --> 00:46:27.792
that old guys get and like--

00:46:27.792 --> 00:46:29.500
ED ROBERTSON: What
are you trying to say?

00:46:29.500 --> 00:46:30.440
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:31.796 --> 00:46:32.920
ADAM GREEN: You're old, Ed.

00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:34.530
You're old.

00:46:34.530 --> 00:46:36.200
No, are there any
mixed emotions about

00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:38.540
like attaining those goals?

00:46:38.540 --> 00:46:41.600
When you start out as like a
bunch of teenagers with a tape

00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:43.130
that you put
together yourselves,

00:46:43.130 --> 00:46:45.230
and then you're always
striving for something,

00:46:45.230 --> 00:46:46.466
and then you get it.

00:46:46.466 --> 00:46:47.840
At this point, is
there any worry

00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:51.200
like, oh, man, this is a
big thing that usually comes

00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:52.680
at the end of people's career?

00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:55.980
And I know you guys are always
a very forward-thinking band.

00:46:55.980 --> 00:46:59.877
ED ROBERTSON: Well, there wasn't
a lot of worry about that.

00:46:59.877 --> 00:47:01.960
ADAM GREEN: Good luck with
that acceptance speech.

00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:02.825
ED ROBERTSON: But now--

00:47:02.825 --> 00:47:04.280
TYLER STEWART: Oh, yeah,
now that you mention it--

00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:06.488
ED ROBERTSON: Now I'm really
fucked bummed out, Adam.

00:47:06.488 --> 00:47:07.831
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:07.831 --> 00:47:08.310
TYLER STEWART: Thanks for
bringing us down, man.

00:47:08.310 --> 00:47:10.018
ED ROBERTSON: I felt
honored and excited.

00:47:10.018 --> 00:47:12.985
And now I just feel like old.

00:47:12.985 --> 00:47:13.606
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:14.300 --> 00:47:16.533
KEVIN HEARN: Minus nine
on the vibe meter, Adam.

00:47:16.533 --> 00:47:17.617
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:17.617 --> 00:47:18.950
ED ROBERTSON: No, you know what?

00:47:18.950 --> 00:47:21.140
It's so exciting.

00:47:21.140 --> 00:47:26.510
And for us, it's
coming at a moment

00:47:26.510 --> 00:47:30.710
where the band is
really feeling great.

00:47:30.710 --> 00:47:34.190
We just did the most
extensive Canadian tour

00:47:34.190 --> 00:47:36.080
we've done in almost 20 years.

00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:36.900
We loved it.

00:47:36.900 --> 00:47:38.720
We had a great time together.

00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:43.410
And we were all feeling good
about, not just the new record,

00:47:43.410 --> 00:47:46.610
but we were putting old
stuff into the set list

00:47:46.610 --> 00:47:49.070
that we hadn't played
in a long, long time.

00:47:49.070 --> 00:47:52.190
And we had a ton of fun with it.

00:47:52.190 --> 00:47:54.050
We released two
records last year.

00:47:54.050 --> 00:47:56.570
We did a record with
the acapella group,

00:47:56.570 --> 00:47:59.390
The Persuasions, called
"Ladies and Gentlemen."

00:47:59.390 --> 00:48:00.260
We loved that.

00:48:00.260 --> 00:48:02.510
Then we put out "Fake Nudes."

00:48:02.510 --> 00:48:05.270
And we just kind of felt like
everything was going great,

00:48:05.270 --> 00:48:07.170
and the band was in
a really good place.

00:48:07.170 --> 00:48:09.139
And then we got
this news that we're

00:48:09.139 --> 00:48:10.930
going to be inducted
into the Hall of Fame.

00:48:10.930 --> 00:48:12.380
So I don't know.

00:48:12.380 --> 00:48:14.450
It just came at a
perfect time for the band

00:48:14.450 --> 00:48:19.720
where we weren't resting on
the laurels of our career.

00:48:19.720 --> 00:48:21.480
We have been pushing forward.

00:48:21.480 --> 00:48:25.050
And after the
Junos this year, we

00:48:25.050 --> 00:48:26.670
had already planned a UK tour.

00:48:26.670 --> 00:48:30.370
And we have an extensive
American tour in June and July.

00:48:30.370 --> 00:48:33.225
KEVIN HEARN: And now
we don't need to do it.

00:48:33.225 --> 00:48:35.100
ED ROBERTSON: Cancel
those, Alison.

00:48:35.100 --> 00:48:35.660
Thank you.

00:48:35.660 --> 00:48:36.720
We're Hall of Famers now.

00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:38.072
We don't need to tour.

00:48:38.072 --> 00:48:39.278
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:39.900 --> 00:48:41.580
ADAM GREEN: So is
it now freeing?

00:48:41.580 --> 00:48:44.690
Are there other goals
that you want to take off?

00:48:44.690 --> 00:48:46.890
Or now is it just like,
let's just go and have fun,

00:48:46.890 --> 00:48:49.189
and our spot in the Hall
of Fame is literally there,

00:48:49.189 --> 00:48:51.480
we don't really need to worry,
we can whatever the heck

00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:52.272
we want?

00:48:52.272 --> 00:48:54.480
ED ROBERTSON: Well, we still
want to make good music.

00:48:54.480 --> 00:49:00.720
I mean, our goal always has
been to make good records

00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:02.150
and do good shows.

00:49:02.150 --> 00:49:04.890
And we've never wavered from--

00:49:04.890 --> 00:49:06.660
that's kind of our compass.

00:49:06.660 --> 00:49:09.605
We're trying to do the
best shows we can do.

00:49:09.605 --> 00:49:10.980
We're trying to
write good songs.

00:49:10.980 --> 00:49:12.480
We're trying to
make good records.

00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:16.740
And we've been super lucky.

00:49:16.740 --> 00:49:18.630
We've had some
really big singles.

00:49:18.630 --> 00:49:22.980
We've won a bunch of awards
and now the Hall of Fame.

00:49:22.980 --> 00:49:28.920
But all of that has come from
pursuing this compass needle

00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:32.640
of just trying to be
good at what we do

00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:34.420
and take our craft seriously.

00:49:34.420 --> 00:49:37.740
And as I always say, as
much as we joke around,

00:49:37.740 --> 00:49:40.290
we really take
performance seriously.

00:49:40.290 --> 00:49:43.680
And we work hard on
the music so that we

00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:47.150
can goof around on the stage.

00:49:47.150 --> 00:49:48.290
ADAM GREEN: Excellent.

00:49:48.290 --> 00:49:51.544
Are there any other
questions from the audience?

00:49:51.544 --> 00:49:52.960
ED ROBERTSON: What
about the baby?

00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:53.768
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:54.980 --> 00:49:56.170
I'll just take--

00:49:56.170 --> 00:49:57.920
I want to take one
question from the baby.

00:49:57.920 --> 00:49:58.711
Everybody be quiet.

00:49:58.711 --> 00:49:59.535
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:02.860 --> 00:50:05.310
Just one question.

00:50:05.310 --> 00:50:05.870
No, shh.

00:50:05.870 --> 00:50:06.620
Hi, Mom.

00:50:06.620 --> 00:50:08.362
Just one question.

00:50:08.362 --> 00:50:10.772
(IN CHILD'S VOICE) Where'd
did you get those shoes, man?

00:50:10.772 --> 00:50:12.420
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:12.420 --> 00:50:14.463
Well, baby, I'm glad you asked.

00:50:14.463 --> 00:50:15.822
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:18.090 --> 00:50:21.180
Can I call you baby?

00:50:21.180 --> 00:50:22.980
You are a baby.

00:50:22.980 --> 00:50:26.220
You're such a baby.

00:50:26.220 --> 00:50:29.247
Just keep sleeping, you baby.

00:50:29.247 --> 00:50:31.080
KEVIN HEARN: You didn't
answer the question.

00:50:34.700 --> 00:50:37.820
ED ROBERTSON: My son got
me these shoes actually.

00:50:37.820 --> 00:50:39.930
My son, Arden, is a
total sneaker head.

00:50:39.930 --> 00:50:42.980
TYLER STEWART: It's thy son.

00:50:42.980 --> 00:50:48.635
ED ROBERTSON: All
thy sons got thee--

00:50:48.635 --> 00:50:50.870
KEVIN HEARN: All of us
bought you those shoes.

00:50:50.870 --> 00:50:52.170
ED ROBERTSON: Thy sneakers.

00:50:52.170 --> 00:50:54.579
ADAM GREEN: Foot Locker,
I think, is the answer.

00:50:54.579 --> 00:50:55.870
ED ROBERTSON: Baby Foot Locker.

00:50:55.870 --> 00:50:56.850
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:57.744 --> 00:50:58.910
ADAM GREEN: All right, guys.

00:50:58.910 --> 00:51:00.730
I think we're pretty
much out of time.

00:51:00.730 --> 00:51:01.850
TYLER STEWART: Any questions
for the room at all?

00:51:01.850 --> 00:51:02.700
Anyone interested?

00:51:02.700 --> 00:51:05.090
Any questions we
haven't answered?

00:51:05.090 --> 00:51:06.640
ED ROBERTSON: We'll
answer anything.

00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:07.300
Yes, sir.

00:51:07.300 --> 00:51:10.380
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:51:10.380 --> 00:51:11.615
ED ROBERTSON: Next question.

00:51:11.615 --> 00:51:12.585
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:13.651 --> 00:51:15.150
ADAM GREEN: Favorite
group or person

00:51:15.150 --> 00:51:16.360
you've shared the stage with
for people on the live stream.

00:51:16.360 --> 00:51:17.910
ED ROBERTSON: That's probably
a pretty easy answer.

00:51:17.910 --> 00:51:18.690
JIM CREEGGAN: Yeah.

00:51:18.690 --> 00:51:19.200
Neil Young.

00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:19.680
ED ROBERTSON: Neil Young.

00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:20.763
TYLER STEWART: Neil Young.

00:51:20.763 --> 00:51:22.260
Yeah, twice we've
got to do that.

00:51:22.260 --> 00:51:24.450
It's been amazing.

00:51:24.450 --> 00:51:26.580
Yeah, totally.

00:51:26.580 --> 00:51:28.860
Here's a great story about
playing with Neil Young.

00:51:28.860 --> 00:51:34.230
We did a benefit for The Blue
Dot Foundation, David Suzuki's

00:51:34.230 --> 00:51:36.300
environmental organization.

00:51:36.300 --> 00:51:38.595
And Neil was on the
show, and we all

00:51:38.595 --> 00:51:40.470
knew we were going to
do the finale with him.

00:51:40.470 --> 00:51:42.360
But we thought we
were just singing.

00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:45.230
But then in the rehearsal,
in the soundcheck,

00:51:45.230 --> 00:51:48.300
he turned to Jim and said,
"Where's your big bass?"

00:51:48.300 --> 00:51:50.862
JIM CREEGGAN: I said,
"Right over here."

00:51:50.862 --> 00:51:52.320
ED ROBERTSON: Jim
learned the song.

00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:53.067
He was ready.

00:51:53.067 --> 00:51:54.150
JIM CREEGGAN: I was ready.

00:51:54.150 --> 00:51:56.720
If that moment happened,
I was going to be ready.

00:51:56.720 --> 00:51:58.410
And he said it.

00:51:58.410 --> 00:51:59.200
He called me out.

00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:00.180
And there it was.

00:52:00.180 --> 00:52:02.638
TYLER STEWART: And he said to
me, "Get on those tubs, man."

00:52:02.638 --> 00:52:07.500
And remember how fast
Roadrunner could go?

00:52:07.500 --> 00:52:09.060
That's how fast I
got on the drums.

00:52:09.060 --> 00:52:11.520
And then we were playing the
song, the vibe was happening.

00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:14.520
It wasn't feeling really
good, and then he stopped us.

00:52:14.520 --> 00:52:17.350
And he said, "That's great.

00:52:17.350 --> 00:52:19.370
Don't give it away.

00:52:19.370 --> 00:52:21.290
We'll see you tonight."

00:52:21.290 --> 00:52:23.090
And soundcheck was over.

00:52:23.090 --> 00:52:24.132
So he wanted that energy.

00:52:24.132 --> 00:52:26.631
ED ROBERTSON: We didn't even
play through the song one time.

00:52:26.631 --> 00:52:28.150
TYLER STEWART: Not once.

00:52:28.150 --> 00:52:31.300
So that's sort of legendary
Neil Young behavior.

00:52:31.300 --> 00:52:33.430
And we got to experience it.

00:52:33.430 --> 00:52:34.630
JIM CREEGGAN: Rock school.

00:52:34.630 --> 00:52:39.280
ED ROBERTSON: And we did Neil's
Bridge School Benefit Concert

00:52:39.280 --> 00:52:41.780
out in San Francisco one time.

00:52:41.780 --> 00:52:44.230
And it's one of the
highlights of my life

00:52:44.230 --> 00:52:45.730
is to be playing this show.

00:52:45.730 --> 00:52:47.942
The kids from the
school are on the stage.

00:52:47.942 --> 00:52:49.525
The audience at
Shoreline Amphitheater

00:52:49.525 --> 00:52:51.820
is like 18,000 people.

00:52:51.820 --> 00:52:53.470
But you're performing
for the kids.

00:52:53.470 --> 00:52:56.800
And there's two
shows in the day.

00:52:56.800 --> 00:53:00.250
The lineups are crazy, because
Neil Young organizes the bill.

00:53:00.250 --> 00:53:02.946
And he calls, and
it's like, well, I

00:53:02.946 --> 00:53:05.320
guess this year it's going to
be Bruce Springsteen, Sarah

00:53:05.320 --> 00:53:08.860
McLachlan, REM,
Barenaked Ladies.

00:53:08.860 --> 00:53:11.030
That's a bill for a show.

00:53:11.030 --> 00:53:12.490
And everybody
plays acoustically.

00:53:12.490 --> 00:53:15.460
And Neil says, "If there's
any instruments plugged in,

00:53:15.460 --> 00:53:17.860
I'll come out there, and
I'll unplug them myself.

00:53:17.860 --> 00:53:18.850
No amplifiers.

00:53:18.850 --> 00:53:20.710
This is an acoustic show."

00:53:20.710 --> 00:53:24.790
But for me, the glorious
part of that whole thing

00:53:24.790 --> 00:53:27.040
was Neil standing on
the side of the stage

00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:31.240
watching our show
and just beaming.

00:53:31.240 --> 00:53:35.800
I learned to play the
guitar to play old man.

00:53:35.800 --> 00:53:39.040
And all these songs off Harvest,
so my older brothers would

00:53:39.040 --> 00:53:40.570
think I was cool.

00:53:40.570 --> 00:53:45.220
And there I was, playing for
a crowd, playing for kids,

00:53:45.220 --> 00:53:48.830
but playing for Neil standing
on the side of the stage.

00:53:48.830 --> 00:53:51.090
We got to go to a
barbecue at his house.

00:53:55.060 --> 00:53:57.320
Neil's house is,
first of all, amazing.

00:53:57.320 --> 00:53:58.900
And we're walking around.

00:53:58.900 --> 00:54:01.900
And just the knick-knacks
around his house

00:54:01.900 --> 00:54:05.580
are like a rock-and-roll museum.

00:54:05.580 --> 00:54:07.720
And Neil came in and
said, "Are you guys OK?

00:54:07.720 --> 00:54:09.040
You got everything you need?"

00:54:09.040 --> 00:54:11.090
And I said, "Neil, I
hope you don't mind.

00:54:11.090 --> 00:54:12.280
We're pretty big fans.

00:54:12.280 --> 00:54:17.289
So I've pocketed a few
things just as a reminder."

00:54:17.289 --> 00:54:18.580
And he didn't even skip a beat.

00:54:18.580 --> 00:54:20.990
He just said, "Do you want
a gym bag or something?"

00:54:20.990 --> 00:54:21.920
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:24.710 --> 00:54:25.430
He's amazing.

00:54:25.430 --> 00:54:28.161
So the answer-- Neil Young.

00:54:28.161 --> 00:54:29.660
TYLER STEWART:
Second place, close--

00:54:29.660 --> 00:54:32.930
Dee Snider from Twisted
Sister at Massey Hall.

00:54:32.930 --> 00:54:35.630
Two years ago, we did "We're
Not Going To Take It."

00:54:35.630 --> 00:54:38.810
And it was the most
rock-and-roll moment we've all

00:54:38.810 --> 00:54:40.220
experienced in our lives.

00:54:40.220 --> 00:54:43.220
ED ROBERTSON: Alan Doyle
was standing backstage.

00:54:43.220 --> 00:54:45.470
And after it happened,
he said, "That

00:54:45.470 --> 00:54:48.930
is one of the top five
musical moments of my life.

00:54:48.930 --> 00:54:50.480
And I wasn't even involved."

00:54:50.480 --> 00:54:51.312
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:53.085 --> 00:54:54.210
ADAM GREEN: That's amazing.

00:54:54.210 --> 00:54:57.430
I can't think of a
better note to end on.

00:54:57.430 --> 00:54:59.180
Thank you so much for
coming in to Google,

00:54:59.180 --> 00:55:01.310
guys, for the conversation
and for the album.

00:55:01.310 --> 00:55:03.339
ED ROBERTSON:
Thanks to the baby.

00:55:03.339 --> 00:55:04.880
ADAM GREEN: The real
hero of the day.

00:55:04.880 --> 00:55:05.390
[APPLAUSE]

00:55:05.390 --> 00:55:07.410
ED ROBERTSON: Thank you baby.

00:55:07.410 --> 00:55:10.400
If anyone would like
a photo with the baby,

00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:11.525
just speak to his agent.

00:55:11.525 --> 00:55:13.460
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:13.460 --> 00:55:14.780
Her agent.

00:55:14.780 --> 00:55:16.310
Her agent, sorry, baby.

00:55:17.944 --> 00:55:19.610
ADAM GREEN: Thanks
for coming, you guys.

00:55:19.610 --> 00:55:20.380
ED ROBERTSON: Thank
you, everybody.

00:55:20.380 --> 00:55:20.750
TYLER STEWART: Thanks, guys.

00:55:20.750 --> 00:55:21.854
ED ROBERTSON: Thank you.

00:55:21.854 --> 00:55:22.520
Thank you, baby.

00:55:22.520 --> 00:55:24.370
[APPLAUSE]
