so<00:00:00.210><c> the</c><00:00:00.359><c> first</c><00:00:00.570><c> thing</c><00:00:00.750><c> we're</c><00:00:00.900><c> going</c><00:00:01.020><c> to</c><00:00:01.140><c> do</c><00:00:01.380><c> is</c>

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:01.650 align:start position:0%
so the first thing we're going to do is
 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:03.740 align:start position:0%
so the first thing we're going to do is
we're<00:00:01.800><c> gonna</c><00:00:01.890><c> draw</c><00:00:02.159><c> some</c><00:00:02.399><c> graph</c><00:00:02.610><c> so</c><00:00:03.120><c> I</c><00:00:03.510><c> don't</c>

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 align:start position:0%
we're gonna draw some graph so I don't
 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.599 align:start position:0%
we're gonna draw some graph so I don't
care<00:00:03.899><c> what</c><00:00:04.080><c> it</c><00:00:04.170><c> looks</c><00:00:04.200><c> like</c><00:00:04.470><c> let's</c><00:00:04.830><c> try</c><00:00:05.069><c> it</c>

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 align:start position:0%
care what it looks like let's try it
 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.310 align:start position:0%
care what it looks like let's try it
put<00:00:06.000><c> a</c><00:00:06.029><c> few</c><00:00:06.210><c> vertices</c><00:00:06.839><c> here</c><00:00:07.109><c> and</c><00:00:07.379><c> some</c><00:00:07.589><c> edges</c>

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:09.320 align:start position:0%
put a few vertices here and some edges
 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.350 align:start position:0%
put a few vertices here and some edges
connect<00:00:10.320><c> it</c><00:00:10.440><c> up</c><00:00:10.530><c> nicely</c><00:00:10.880><c> okay</c><00:00:11.880><c> so</c><00:00:11.940><c> there's</c><00:00:12.300><c> a</c>

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 align:start position:0%
connect it up nicely okay so there's a
 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.110 align:start position:0%
connect it up nicely okay so there's a
graph<00:00:12.570><c> and</c><00:00:12.990><c> now</c><00:00:13.710><c> I'm</c><00:00:13.860><c> gonna</c><00:00:13.980><c> give</c><00:00:14.250><c> each</c><00:00:14.519><c> vertex</c>

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 align:start position:0%
graph and now I'm gonna give each vertex
 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.300 align:start position:0%
graph and now I'm gonna give each vertex
of<00:00:15.269><c> my</c><00:00:15.420><c> graph</c><00:00:15.599><c> a</c><00:00:15.750><c> number</c><00:00:16.049><c> and</c><00:00:16.289><c> again</c><00:00:17.039><c> you</c><00:00:17.160><c> can</c>

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 align:start position:0%
of my graph a number and again you can
 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.890 align:start position:0%
of my graph a number and again you can
just<00:00:17.430><c> choose</c><00:00:17.670><c> this</c><00:00:17.789><c> randomly</c><00:00:18.270><c> and</c><00:00:18.480><c> it</c><00:00:18.779><c> can</c>

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 align:start position:0%
just choose this randomly and it can
 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.080 align:start position:0%
just choose this randomly and it can
even<00:00:19.050><c> be</c><00:00:19.230><c> a</c><00:00:19.260><c> negative</c><00:00:19.470><c> number</c><00:00:19.710><c> okay</c><00:00:20.609><c> so</c><00:00:20.760><c> let's</c>

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 align:start position:0%
even be a negative number okay so let's
 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.380 align:start position:0%
even be a negative number okay so let's
say<00:00:21.330><c> I've</c><00:00:22.260><c> got</c><00:00:22.320><c> negative</c><00:00:22.949><c> two</c><00:00:23.250><c> here</c><00:00:23.820><c> I</c><00:00:24.060><c> don't</c>

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 align:start position:0%
say I've got negative two here I don't
 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.269 align:start position:0%
say I've got negative two here I don't
know<00:00:24.449><c> what</c><00:00:24.600><c> do</c><00:00:24.660><c> you</c><00:00:24.720><c> want</c><00:00:24.840><c> here</c><00:00:24.990><c> right</c><00:00:25.619><c> three</c>

so let's take a look at this example
 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.780 align:start position:0%
so let's take a look at this example
that<00:01:18.390><c> we've</c><00:01:18.659><c> drawn</c><00:01:18.960><c> here</c><00:01:18.990><c> and</c><00:01:19.470><c> see</c><00:01:20.220><c> if</c><00:01:20.460><c> we</c><00:01:20.610><c> can</c>

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 align:start position:0%
do a different color so we don't get
 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.179 align:start position:0%
do a different color so we don't get
confused<00:01:31.850><c> okay</c><00:01:32.850><c> so</c><00:01:33.150><c> if</c><00:01:33.509><c> 3</c><00:01:33.810><c> goes</c><00:01:34.049><c> that</c><00:01:34.740><c> means</c><00:01:34.950><c> 3</c>

negative 1 instead of negative 2 which
 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:46.910 align:start position:0%
negative 1 instead of negative 2 which
is<00:01:45.509><c> better</c><00:01:45.810><c> for</c><00:01:46.229><c> getting</c><00:01:46.470><c> everyone</c><00:01:46.710><c> out</c><00:01:46.890><c> of</c>

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:00.610 align:start position:0%
good yeah let's get rid of his three
okay<00:02:58.050><c> so</c><00:02:58.080><c> five</c><00:02:58.740><c> can</c><00:02:59.070><c> give</c><00:02:59.250><c> goes</c><00:02:59.700><c> down</c><00:02:59.910><c> to</c><00:03:00.060><c> two</c>

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 align:start position:0%
okay so five can give goes down to two
 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.240 align:start position:0%
okay so five can give goes down to two
one<00:03:01.620><c> two</c><00:03:02.250><c> minus</c><00:03:03.240><c> two</c><00:03:03.570><c> and</c><00:03:04.560><c> then</c><00:03:04.710><c> I</c><00:03:04.800><c> guess</c><00:03:04.950><c> every</c>

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 align:start position:0%
one two minus two and then I guess every
 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.350 align:start position:0%
one two minus two and then I guess every
time<00:03:05.460><c> we</c><00:03:05.580><c> have</c><00:03:05.700><c> something</c><00:03:06.030><c> here</c><00:03:06.210><c> we</c><00:03:06.300><c> should</c>

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 align:start position:0%
time we have something here we should
 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.530 align:start position:0%
time we have something here we should
move<00:03:06.600><c> it</c><00:03:06.720><c> back</c><00:03:06.900><c> right</c><00:03:07.140><c> yeah</c><00:03:07.440><c> I</c><00:03:07.470><c> go</c><00:03:07.830><c> zero</c><00:03:08.610><c> and</c>

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 align:start position:0%
move it back right yeah I go zero and
 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.220 align:start position:0%
move it back right yeah I go zero and
three<00:03:10.020><c> and</c><00:03:10.470><c> now</c><00:03:10.820><c> to</c><00:03:11.820><c> up</c><00:03:12.030><c> here</c><00:03:12.240><c> yeah</c><00:03:12.780><c> do</c><00:03:13.080><c> another</c>

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 align:start position:0%
three and now to up here yeah do another
 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.780 align:start position:0%
three and now to up here yeah do another
good<00:03:13.530><c> good</c><00:03:14.040><c> zero</c><00:03:15.110><c> minus</c><00:03:16.110><c> one</c><00:03:16.230><c> for</c><00:03:17.040><c> oh</c><00:03:17.460><c> it</c><00:03:17.610><c> looks</c>

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 align:start position:0%
good good zero minus one for oh it looks
 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:24.260 align:start position:0%
good good zero minus one for oh it looks
pretty<00:03:17.970><c> good</c><00:03:21.020><c> that's</c><00:03:22.020><c> right</c><00:03:22.320><c> okay</c><00:03:22.800><c> so</c><00:03:22.890><c> one</c><00:03:23.340><c> one</c>

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270 align:start position:0%
pretty good that's right okay so one one
 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:28.670 align:start position:0%
pretty good that's right okay so one one
and<00:03:24.570><c> zero</c><00:03:25.290><c> okay</c><00:03:26.100><c> oh</c><00:03:26.730><c> and</c><00:03:27.000><c> I</c><00:03:27.060><c> went</c><00:03:27.209><c> up</c><00:03:27.300><c> here</c><00:03:27.680><c> okay</c>

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 align:start position:0%
and zero okay oh and I went up here okay
 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.670 align:start position:0%
and zero okay oh and I went up here okay
so<00:03:28.740><c> we</c><00:03:28.980><c> went</c><00:03:29.190><c> right</c><00:03:29.540><c> after</c><00:03:30.540><c> much</c><00:03:31.140><c> much</c>

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
so we went right after much much
 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.020 align:start position:0%
so we went right after much much
difficulty<00:03:32.370><c> we've</c><00:03:33.240><c> got</c><00:03:33.450><c> zero</c><00:03:33.810><c> and</c><00:03:34.230><c> one</c><00:03:34.530><c> zero</c>

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 align:start position:0%
difficulty we've got zero and one zero
 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.420 align:start position:0%
difficulty we've got zero and one zero
one<00:03:36.030><c> and</c><00:03:36.330><c> one</c><00:03:36.900><c> is</c><00:03:37.200><c> we</c><00:03:37.410><c> have</c><00:03:37.560><c> demonstrated</c><00:03:37.740><c> very</c>

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 align:start position:0%
one and one is we have demonstrated very
 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.250 align:start position:0%
one and one is we have demonstrated very
well<00:03:38.670><c> here</c><00:03:38.910><c> it's</c><00:03:39.240><c> not</c><00:03:39.420><c> obvious</c><00:03:39.870><c> if</c><00:03:40.020><c> we</c><00:03:40.110><c> took</c>

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 align:start position:0%
well here it's not obvious if we took
 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.230 align:start position:0%
well here it's not obvious if we took
the<00:03:40.380><c> optimal</c><00:03:40.890><c> strategy</c><00:03:41.370><c> to</c><00:03:41.610><c> win</c><00:03:41.790><c> this</c><00:03:41.970><c> game</c>

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:42.240 align:start position:0%
the optimal strategy to win this game
 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.120 align:start position:0%
the optimal strategy to win this game
it's<00:03:43.020><c> possible</c><00:03:43.560><c> that</c><00:03:43.680><c> we</c><00:03:43.800><c> could</c><00:03:43.950><c> have</c><00:03:44.040><c> done</c>

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 align:start position:0%
it's possible that we could have done
 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.190 align:start position:0%
it's possible that we could have done
fewer<00:03:44.490><c> moves</c><00:03:44.760><c> and</c><00:03:45.150><c> so</c><00:03:45.630><c> one</c><00:03:45.840><c> question</c><00:03:45.990><c> you</c>

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 align:start position:0%
fewer moves and so one question you
 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.290 align:start position:0%
fewer moves and so one question you
could<00:03:46.350><c> ask</c><00:03:46.410><c> is</c><00:03:46.800><c> if</c><00:03:47.130><c> you</c><00:03:47.490><c> hand</c><00:03:47.760><c> me</c><00:03:47.820><c> a</c><00:03:47.910><c> game</c><00:03:48.150><c> like</c>

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:48.300 align:start position:0%
could ask is if you hand me a game like
 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:49.970 align:start position:0%
could ask is if you hand me a game like
this<00:03:48.360><c> if</c><00:03:48.810><c> you</c><00:03:48.900><c> draw</c><00:03:49.080><c> the</c><00:03:49.200><c> graph</c><00:03:49.440><c> and</c><00:03:49.860><c> you</c>

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 align:start position:0%
this if you draw the graph and you
 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.540 align:start position:0%
this if you draw the graph and you
assign<00:03:50.250><c> the</c><00:03:50.430><c> numbers</c><00:03:50.760><c> how</c><00:03:51.720><c> few</c><00:03:52.200><c> moves</c><00:03:52.530><c> can</c><00:03:53.459><c> you</c>

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:53.550 align:start position:0%
assign the numbers how few moves can you
 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:55.880 align:start position:0%
assign the numbers how few moves can you
win<00:03:53.700><c> the</c><00:03:53.820><c> game</c><00:03:53.970><c> in</c><00:03:54.150><c> but</c><00:03:55.050><c> before</c><00:03:55.200><c> you</c><00:03:55.500><c> even</c><00:03:55.680><c> ask</c>

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 align:start position:0%
win the game in but before you even ask
 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:57.560 align:start position:0%
win the game in but before you even ask
that<00:03:55.950><c> question</c><00:03:56.400><c> you</c><00:03:56.430><c> might</c><00:03:56.700><c> wonder</c><00:03:56.820><c> when</c><00:03:57.450><c> is</c>

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 align:start position:0%
that question you might wonder when is
 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.020 align:start position:0%
that question you might wonder when is
it<00:03:57.720><c> possible</c><00:03:58.140><c> to</c><00:03:58.290><c> win</c><00:03:58.470><c> this</c><00:03:58.709><c> game</c><00:03:58.950><c> right</c><00:03:59.790><c> like</c>

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 align:start position:0%
it possible to win this game right like
 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.340 align:start position:0%
it possible to win this game right like
if<00:04:00.120><c> we</c><00:04:00.240><c> had</c><00:04:00.330><c> started</c><00:04:00.570><c> with</c><00:04:00.720><c> all</c><00:04:00.930><c> negative</c>

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350 align:start position:0%
if we had started with all negative
 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.620 align:start position:0%
if we had started with all negative
numbers<00:04:01.770><c> then</c><00:04:02.370><c> obviously</c><00:04:02.550><c> it's</c><00:04:03.060><c> impossible</c>

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 align:start position:0%
numbers then obviously it's impossible
 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.750 align:start position:0%
numbers then obviously it's impossible
because<00:04:04.350><c> no</c><00:04:04.470><c> matter</c><00:04:04.620><c> what</c><00:04:04.830><c> we</c><00:04:04.890><c> try</c><00:04:05.160><c> it's</c><00:04:05.550><c> not</c>

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
because no matter what we try it's not
 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.690 align:start position:0%
because no matter what we try it's not
going<00:04:05.940><c> to</c><00:04:06.000><c> finish</c><00:04:06.660><c> the</c><00:04:06.840><c> problem</c><00:04:06.990><c> or</c><00:04:07.980><c> even</c><00:04:08.040><c> you</c>

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 align:start position:0%
going to finish the problem or even you
 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.250 align:start position:0%
going to finish the problem or even you
can<00:04:08.730><c> think</c><00:04:09.060><c> about</c><00:04:09.180><c> if</c><00:04:09.540><c> we</c><00:04:09.690><c> had</c><00:04:09.810><c> started</c><00:04:10.080><c> with</c>

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 align:start position:0%
can think about if we had started with
 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.770 align:start position:0%
can think about if we had started with
numbers<00:04:10.800><c> that</c><00:04:10.830><c> have</c><00:04:11.190><c> the</c><00:04:11.340><c> property</c><00:04:11.640><c> that</c><00:04:12.090><c> they</c>

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 align:start position:0%
numbers that have the property that they
 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.170 align:start position:0%
numbers that have the property that they
don't<00:04:13.170><c> add</c><00:04:13.380><c> up</c><00:04:13.770><c> to</c><00:04:14.040><c> something</c><00:04:14.310><c> non-negative</c>

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 align:start position:0%
don't add up to something non-negative
 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.420 align:start position:0%
don't add up to something non-negative
right<00:04:15.930><c> like</c><00:04:16.169><c> if</c><00:04:16.260><c> the</c><00:04:16.410><c> sum</c><00:04:16.739><c> of</c><00:04:16.770><c> all</c><00:04:17.130><c> of</c><00:04:17.310><c> the</c>

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 align:start position:0%
right like if the sum of all of the
 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.870 align:start position:0%
right like if the sum of all of the
numbers<00:04:17.790><c> was</c><00:04:18.450><c> negative</c><00:04:19.489><c> there</c><00:04:20.489><c> has</c><00:04:20.669><c> to</c><00:04:20.700><c> be</c>

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
numbers was negative there has to be
 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.190 align:start position:0%
numbers was negative there has to be
enough<00:04:21.150><c> money</c><00:04:21.359><c> on</c><00:04:21.419><c> the</c><00:04:21.600><c> board</c><00:04:21.810><c> to</c><00:04:22.080><c> get</c>

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 align:start position:0%
enough money on the board to get
 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.380 align:start position:0%
enough money on the board to get
everyone<00:04:22.500><c> out</c><00:04:22.620><c> of</c><00:04:22.650><c> debt</c><00:04:22.919><c> exactly</c><00:04:23.520><c> so</c><00:04:24.210><c> there</c>

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 align:start position:0%
everyone out of debt exactly so there
 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.120 align:start position:0%
everyone out of debt exactly so there
are<00:04:24.479><c> obviously</c><00:04:24.570><c> some</c><00:04:25.050><c> constraints</c><00:04:25.710><c> for</c><00:04:26.010><c> when</c>

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 align:start position:0%
are obviously some constraints for when
 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:26.990 align:start position:0%
are obviously some constraints for when
you<00:04:26.220><c> can</c><00:04:26.340><c> win</c><00:04:26.460><c> this</c><00:04:26.580><c> game</c>

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 align:start position:0%
you can win this game
 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.930 align:start position:0%
you can win this game
so<00:04:27.540><c> let's</c><00:04:27.930><c> do</c><00:04:28.140><c> a</c><00:04:28.410><c> slightly</c><00:04:28.800><c> simpler</c><00:04:29.310><c> version</c>

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 align:start position:0%
so let's do a slightly simpler version
 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.630 align:start position:0%
so let's do a slightly simpler version
so<00:04:30.390><c> let's</c><00:04:30.450><c> say</c><00:04:30.630><c> we</c><00:04:30.780><c> just</c><00:04:30.960><c> have</c><00:04:31.080><c> two</c><00:04:31.640><c> vertices</c>

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:32.640 align:start position:0%
so let's say we just have two vertices
 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:36.680 align:start position:0%
so let's say we just have two vertices
and<00:04:33.020><c> we'll</c><00:04:34.020><c> connect</c><00:04:34.320><c> them</c><00:04:34.440><c> by</c><00:04:34.590><c> an</c><00:04:34.710><c> edge</c><00:04:35.540><c> now</c><00:04:36.540><c> my</c>

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 align:start position:0%
and we'll connect them by an edge now my
 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.840 align:start position:0%
and we'll connect them by an edge now my
question<00:04:36.750><c> is</c><00:04:37.230><c> what</c><00:04:37.500><c> kind</c><00:04:37.740><c> of</c><00:04:37.860><c> money</c><00:04:38.160><c> can</c><00:04:38.430><c> I</c><00:04:38.670><c> put</c>

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 align:start position:0%
question is what kind of money can I put
 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:40.640 align:start position:0%
question is what kind of money can I put
into<00:04:39.000><c> this</c><00:04:39.180><c> game</c><00:04:39.420><c> to</c><00:04:39.870><c> make</c><00:04:39.990><c> it</c><00:04:40.110><c> possible</c><00:04:40.290><c> to</c>

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 align:start position:0%
into this game to make it possible to
 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.430 align:start position:0%
into this game to make it possible to
win<00:04:40.800><c> so</c><00:04:41.760><c> for</c><00:04:41.940><c> example</c><00:04:42.240><c> if</c><00:04:42.330><c> I</c><00:04:42.420><c> have</c><00:04:42.570><c> -2</c><00:04:43.200><c> here</c>

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
win so for example if I have -2 here
 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.530 align:start position:0%
win so for example if I have -2 here
let's<00:04:43.710><c> say</c><00:04:43.920><c> what</c><00:04:44.490><c> numbers</c><00:04:44.820><c> will</c><00:04:45.030><c> work</c><00:04:45.210><c> over</c>

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 align:start position:0%
let's say what numbers will work over
 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.870 align:start position:0%
let's say what numbers will work over
here<00:04:45.570><c> to</c><00:04:46.230><c> make</c><00:04:46.350><c> it</c><00:04:46.470><c> a</c><00:04:46.530><c> winnable</c><00:04:46.950><c> game</c><00:04:47.160><c> and</c><00:04:47.460><c> the</c>

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 align:start position:0%
here to make it a winnable game and the
 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.510 align:start position:0%
here to make it a winnable game and the
answer<00:04:48.180><c> as</c><00:04:48.210><c> well</c><00:04:48.540><c> as</c><00:04:49.230><c> long</c><00:04:49.740><c> as</c><00:04:49.860><c> I</c><00:04:49.920><c> have</c><00:04:50.040><c> 2</c><00:04:50.220><c> over</c>

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 align:start position:0%
answer as well as long as I have 2 over
 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.420 align:start position:0%
answer as well as long as I have 2 over
here<00:04:50.550><c> then</c><00:04:51.120><c> I</c><00:04:51.210><c> can</c><00:04:51.360><c> win</c><00:04:51.510><c> so</c><00:04:51.840><c> in</c><00:04:52.050><c> this</c><00:04:52.200><c> game</c><00:04:52.470><c> so</c>

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 align:start position:0%
here then I can win so in this game so
 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.600 align:start position:0%
here then I can win so in this game so
the<00:04:53.580><c> only</c><00:04:53.760><c> thing</c><00:04:54.450><c> we</c><00:04:54.570><c> need</c><00:04:54.750><c> to</c><00:04:54.780><c> win</c><00:04:55.110><c> is</c><00:04:55.430><c> to</c><00:04:56.430><c> have</c>

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 align:start position:0%
the only thing we need to win is to have
 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.400 align:start position:0%
the only thing we need to win is to have
enough<00:04:56.850><c> money</c><00:04:57.030><c> in</c><00:04:57.600><c> other</c><00:04:57.840><c> words</c><00:04:58.020><c> we've</c><00:04:58.140><c> got</c><00:04:58.170><c> to</c>

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:58.410 align:start position:0%
enough money in other words we've got to
 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:01.910 align:start position:0%
enough money in other words we've got to
have<00:04:58.560><c> a</c><00:04:59.090><c> non-negative</c><00:05:00.090><c> sum</c><00:05:00.270><c> in</c><00:05:00.360><c> the</c><00:05:00.450><c> bank</c><00:05:00.920><c> on</c>

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
have a non-negative sum in the bank on
 

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.280 align:start position:0%
have a non-negative sum in the bank on
the<00:05:02.100><c> board</c><00:05:02.310><c> okay</c><00:05:03.120><c> so</c><00:05:03.480><c> let's</c><00:05:03.720><c> do</c><00:05:03.930><c> something</c>

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:04.290 align:start position:0%
the board okay so let's do something
 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:07.910 align:start position:0%
the board okay so let's do something
similar<00:05:04.560><c> here</c><00:05:04.740><c> now</c><00:05:05.670><c> with</c><00:05:05.850><c> 3</c><00:05:06.180><c> vertices</c><00:05:06.570><c> and</c><00:05:07.470><c> now</c>

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
similar here now with 3 vertices and now
 

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:11.210 align:start position:0%
similar here now with 3 vertices and now
it's<00:05:08.370><c> not</c><00:05:08.700><c> so</c><00:05:09.210><c> obvious</c><00:05:09.590><c> exactly</c><00:05:10.590><c> if</c><00:05:10.740><c> this</c><00:05:11.040><c> is</c>

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 align:start position:0%
it's not so obvious exactly if this is
 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.340 align:start position:0%
it's not so obvious exactly if this is
still<00:05:11.490><c> true</c><00:05:11.850><c> right</c><00:05:12.330><c> I</c><00:05:12.690><c> mean</c><00:05:12.840><c> so</c><00:05:13.020><c> let's</c><00:05:13.170><c> say</c><00:05:13.320><c> I</c>

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:13.350 align:start position:0%
still true right I mean so let's say I
 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:15.200 align:start position:0%
still true right I mean so let's say I
have<00:05:13.560><c> something</c><00:05:13.770><c> negative</c><00:05:14.250><c> over</c><00:05:14.490><c> here</c><00:05:14.940><c> and</c>

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210 align:start position:0%
have something negative over here and
 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.960 align:start position:0%
have something negative over here and
maybe<00:05:16.050><c> I</c><00:05:16.500><c> don't</c><00:05:16.710><c> know</c><00:05:16.890><c> negative</c><00:05:17.310><c> over</c><00:05:17.550><c> here</c>

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970 align:start position:0%
maybe I don't know negative over here
 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:19.760 align:start position:0%
maybe I don't know negative over here
again<00:05:18.570><c> I</c><00:05:18.600><c> want</c><00:05:18.930><c> to</c><00:05:18.960><c> have</c><00:05:19.110><c> enough</c><00:05:19.350><c> money</c><00:05:19.500><c> on</c><00:05:19.680><c> the</c>

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770 align:start position:0%
again I want to have enough money on the
 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:21.020 align:start position:0%
again I want to have enough money on the
board<00:05:19.950><c> so</c><00:05:20.070><c> I've</c><00:05:20.160><c> got</c><00:05:20.310><c> to</c><00:05:20.400><c> have</c><00:05:20.490><c> at</c><00:05:20.580><c> least</c><00:05:20.610><c> 3</c>

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.030 align:start position:0%
board so I've got to have at least 3
 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:23.090 align:start position:0%
board so I've got to have at least 3
here<00:05:21.480><c> let's</c><00:05:22.080><c> say</c><00:05:22.200><c> I</c><00:05:22.230><c> have</c><00:05:22.350><c> 4</c><00:05:22.590><c> or</c><00:05:22.740><c> something</c>

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:23.100 align:start position:0%
here let's say I have 4 or something
 

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:26.180 align:start position:0%
here let's say I have 4 or something
like<00:05:23.190><c> that</c><00:05:23.720><c> then</c><00:05:24.720><c> what</c><00:05:24.840><c> I</c><00:05:24.900><c> can</c><00:05:25.020><c> do</c><00:05:25.380><c> is</c><00:05:25.770><c> I</c><00:05:26.130><c> can</c>

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:26.190 align:start position:0%
like that then what I can do is I can
 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:27.890 align:start position:0%
like that then what I can do is I can
donate<00:05:26.610><c> all</c><00:05:26.850><c> of</c><00:05:27.270><c> the</c><00:05:27.419><c> money</c><00:05:27.600><c> from</c><00:05:27.690><c> the</c>

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900 align:start position:0%
donate all of the money from the
 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.909 align:start position:0%
donate all of the money from the
positive<00:05:28.169><c> vertex</c><00:05:28.860><c> to</c><00:05:29.550><c> the</c><00:05:29.669><c> other</c><00:05:29.820><c> 2</c><00:05:30.060><c> vertices</c>

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:30.919 align:start position:0%
positive vertex to the other 2 vertices
 

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:32.900 align:start position:0%
positive vertex to the other 2 vertices
but<00:05:31.919><c> because</c><00:05:32.250><c> of</c><00:05:32.400><c> the</c><00:05:32.490><c> way</c><00:05:32.610><c> that</c><00:05:32.730><c> they're</c>

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:32.910 align:start position:0%
but because of the way that they're
 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:34.400 align:start position:0%
but because of the way that they're
connected<00:05:33.390><c> I</c><00:05:33.570><c> can</c><00:05:33.690><c> always</c><00:05:33.810><c> balance</c><00:05:34.290><c> it</c>

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:34.410 align:start position:0%
connected I can always balance it
 

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:35.720 align:start position:0%
connected I can always balance it
between<00:05:34.620><c> the</c><00:05:34.800><c> two</c><00:05:34.830><c> of</c><00:05:34.980><c> them</c><00:05:35.220><c> so</c><00:05:35.400><c> that</c><00:05:35.490><c> it</c><00:05:35.610><c> works</c>

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:35.730 align:start position:0%
between the two of them so that it works
 

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:38.060 align:start position:0%
between the two of them so that it works
and<00:05:36.230><c> so</c><00:05:37.230><c> the</c><00:05:37.350><c> thing</c><00:05:37.500><c> that</c><00:05:37.620><c> was</c><00:05:37.740><c> true</c><00:05:37.860><c> for</c><00:05:37.919><c> the</c>

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:38.070 align:start position:0%
and so the thing that was true for the
 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:40.460 align:start position:0%
and so the thing that was true for the
two<00:05:38.280><c> vertex</c><00:05:39.030><c> example</c><00:05:39.480><c> is</c><00:05:39.630><c> also</c><00:05:39.990><c> true</c><00:05:40.200><c> for</c><00:05:40.230><c> this</c>

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:40.470 align:start position:0%
two vertex example is also true for this
 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:42.950 align:start position:0%
two vertex example is also true for this
3<00:05:40.710><c> vertex</c><00:05:41.040><c> example</c><00:05:41.580><c> but</c><00:05:41.910><c> let's</c><00:05:42.660><c> try</c><00:05:42.870><c> a</c>

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
3 vertex example but let's try a
 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.010 align:start position:0%
3 vertex example but let's try a
different<00:05:43.080><c> arrangement</c><00:05:43.680><c> of</c><00:05:44.479><c> three</c><00:05:45.479><c> vertices</c>

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:46.020 align:start position:0%
different arrangement of three vertices
 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:48.950 align:start position:0%
different arrangement of three vertices
it<00:05:46.680><c> turns</c><00:05:47.040><c> out</c><00:05:47.280><c> that</c><00:05:47.820><c> it's</c><00:05:48.000><c> possible</c><00:05:48.600><c> in</c><00:05:48.840><c> this</c>

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
it turns out that it's possible in this
 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.230 align:start position:0%
it turns out that it's possible in this
arrangement<00:05:49.530><c> to</c><00:05:50.160><c> have</c><00:05:50.190><c> enough</c><00:05:50.669><c> money</c><00:05:50.880><c> on</c><00:05:51.120><c> the</c>

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:51.240 align:start position:0%

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:54.870 align:start position:0%
going to show you a way that that can
 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:58.460 align:start position:0%
going to show you a way that that can
happen<00:05:55.140><c> so</c><00:05:55.530><c> if</c><00:05:56.160><c> I</c><00:05:56.310><c> assign</c><00:05:56.669><c> the</c><00:05:56.820><c> number</c><00:05:56.970><c> 0</c><00:05:57.930><c> here</c>

00:05:58.460 --> 00:05:58.470 align:start position:0%
happen so if I assign the number 0 here
 

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:03.680 align:start position:0%
happen so if I assign the number 0 here
1<00:05:59.460><c> here</c><00:05:59.940><c> and</c><00:06:00.380><c> minus</c><00:06:01.380><c> 1</c><00:06:01.590><c> here</c><00:06:02.390><c> then</c><00:06:03.390><c> let's</c><00:06:03.600><c> think</c>

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:03.690 align:start position:0%
1 here and minus 1 here then let's think
 

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:05.510 align:start position:0%
1 here and minus 1 here then let's think
about<00:06:03.930><c> what's</c><00:06:04.200><c> going</c><00:06:04.350><c> to</c><00:06:04.380><c> happen</c><00:06:04.710><c> so</c><00:06:04.950><c> I</c><00:06:05.310><c> have</c>

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
about what's going to happen so I have
 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:06.980 align:start position:0%
about what's going to happen so I have
enough<00:06:05.729><c> money</c><00:06:05.850><c> on</c><00:06:06.060><c> the</c><00:06:06.150><c> board</c><00:06:06.330><c> right</c><00:06:06.630><c> the</c><00:06:06.810><c> sum</c>

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:06.990 align:start position:0%
enough money on the board right the sum
 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:10.040 align:start position:0%
enough money on the board right the sum
is<00:06:07.140><c> 0</c><00:06:07.380><c> but</c><00:06:08.010><c> if</c><00:06:08.400><c> I</c><00:06:08.940><c> donate</c><00:06:09.360><c> from</c><00:06:09.600><c> one</c><00:06:09.750><c> of</c><00:06:09.870><c> the</c>

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:10.050 align:start position:0%
is 0 but if I donate from one of the
 

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:12.590 align:start position:0%
is 0 but if I donate from one of the

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:12.600 align:start position:0%
positive vertices it will immediately
 

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.900 align:start position:0%
positive vertices it will immediately
turn<00:06:13.020><c> negative</c><00:06:13.500><c> and</c><00:06:13.800><c> that's</c><00:06:14.130><c> true</c><00:06:14.520><c> no</c><00:06:14.729><c> matter</c>

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:14.910 align:start position:0%
turn negative and that's true no matter
 

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:16.760 align:start position:0%
turn negative and that's true no matter
how<00:06:15.060><c> many</c><00:06:15.240><c> times</c><00:06:15.479><c> I</c><00:06:15.630><c> try</c><00:06:15.840><c> and</c><00:06:15.900><c> do</c><00:06:16.110><c> it</c><00:06:16.229><c> and</c><00:06:16.530><c> so</c><00:06:16.740><c> I</c>

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:16.770 align:start position:0%
how many times I try and do it and so I
 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:18.980 align:start position:0%
how many times I try and do it and so I
can<00:06:17.010><c> never</c><00:06:17.250><c> get</c><00:06:17.550><c> rid</c><00:06:17.760><c> of</c><00:06:17.940><c> the</c><00:06:18.540><c> fact</c><00:06:18.750><c> that</c><00:06:18.840><c> we</c>

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:18.990 align:start position:0%
can never get rid of the fact that we
 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:20.690 align:start position:0%
can never get rid of the fact that we
have<00:06:19.140><c> some</c><00:06:19.410><c> negative</c><00:06:19.620><c> vertex</c><00:06:20.220><c> in</c><00:06:20.370><c> this</c><00:06:20.490><c> graph</c>

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:20.700 align:start position:0%
have some negative vertex in this graph
 

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:22.370 align:start position:0%
have some negative vertex in this graph
even<00:06:21.060><c> though</c><00:06:21.419><c> there's</c><00:06:21.630><c> enough</c><00:06:21.900><c> money</c><00:06:22.110><c> on</c><00:06:22.200><c> the</c>

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:22.380 align:start position:0%
even though there's enough money on the

even though there's enough money on the

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:24.450 align:start position:0%
board because you always have to move
 

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:26.810 align:start position:0%
board because you always have to move
yeah<00:06:25.440><c> that's</c><00:06:25.800><c> right</c><00:06:25.979><c> because</c><00:06:26.190><c> there's</c><00:06:26.610><c> too</c>

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:26.820 align:start position:0%
yeah that's right because there's too
 

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:28.159 align:start position:0%
yeah that's right because there's too
much<00:06:26.940><c> connection</c><00:06:27.390><c> right</c><00:06:27.720><c> what's</c><00:06:27.990><c> the</c>

00:06:28.159 --> 00:06:28.169 align:start position:0%
much connection right what's the
 

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:30.290 align:start position:0%
much connection right what's the
difference<00:06:28.500><c> between</c><00:06:28.860><c> these</c><00:06:28.979><c> two</c><00:06:29.190><c> graphs</c><00:06:29.490><c> it's</c>

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:30.300 align:start position:0%
difference between these two graphs it's
 

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:32.480 align:start position:0%
difference between these two graphs it's
that<00:06:30.570><c> I</c><00:06:30.810><c> can't</c><00:06:31.169><c> move</c><00:06:31.380><c> sort</c><00:06:31.710><c> of</c><00:06:31.830><c> freely</c><00:06:32.310><c> between</c>

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:32.490 align:start position:0%
that I can't move sort of freely between
 

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:34.700 align:start position:0%
that I can't move sort of freely between
two<00:06:32.850><c> chosen</c><00:06:33.120><c> vertices</c><00:06:33.780><c> I</c><00:06:33.810><c> have</c><00:06:34.080><c> to</c><00:06:34.200><c> donate</c><00:06:34.440><c> all</c>

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:34.710 align:start position:0%
two chosen vertices I have to donate all
 

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:37.130 align:start position:0%
two chosen vertices I have to donate all
or<00:06:34.890><c> nothing</c><00:06:35.250><c> in</c><00:06:35.460><c> the</c><00:06:35.520><c> second</c><00:06:36.270><c> case</c><00:06:36.390><c> and</c><00:06:36.720><c> so</c>

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:37.140 align:start position:0%
or nothing in the second case and so
 

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:38.839 align:start position:0%
or nothing in the second case and so
it's<00:06:37.289><c> not</c><00:06:37.470><c> enough</c><00:06:37.860><c> so</c><00:06:38.310><c> this</c><00:06:38.430><c> is</c><00:06:38.580><c> a</c><00:06:38.610><c> bad</c>

00:06:38.839 --> 00:06:38.849 align:start position:0%
it's not enough so this is a bad
 

00:06:38.849 --> 00:06:40.050 align:start position:0%
it's not enough so this is a bad
configuration

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:40.060 align:start position:0%
configuration
 

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:42.240 align:start position:0%

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:42.250 align:start position:0%
at game not winnable it's not enough
 

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:43.860 align:start position:0%
at game not winnable it's not enough
just<00:06:42.280><c> to</c><00:06:42.730><c> have</c><00:06:42.940><c> enough</c><00:06:43.180><c> money</c><00:06:43.389><c> on</c><00:06:43.480><c> the</c><00:06:43.690><c> board</c>

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:43.870 align:start position:0%
just to have enough money on the board
 

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:46.950 align:start position:0%
just to have enough money on the board
for<00:06:44.139><c> all</c><00:06:44.169><c> possible</c><00:06:44.770><c> graphs</c><00:06:45.010><c> and</c><00:06:45.490><c> so</c><00:06:46.480><c> then</c><00:06:46.660><c> okay</c>

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:46.960 align:start position:0%
for all possible graphs and so then okay
 

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:49.740 align:start position:0%
for all possible graphs and so then okay
the<00:06:47.770><c> question</c><00:06:48.070><c> is</c><00:06:48.340><c> can</c><00:06:48.760><c> I</c><00:06:48.880><c> tell</c><00:06:49.060><c> and</c><00:06:49.300><c> it</c><00:06:49.540><c> turns</c>

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:49.750 align:start position:0%
the question is can I tell and it turns
 

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:52.050 align:start position:0%
the question is can I tell and it turns
out<00:06:49.870><c> to</c><00:06:49.990><c> be</c><00:06:50.020><c> really</c><00:06:50.560><c> complicated</c><00:06:51.280><c> actually</c><00:06:51.520><c> to</c>

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:52.060 align:start position:0%
out to be really complicated actually to
 

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:54.900 align:start position:0%
out to be really complicated actually to
answer<00:06:52.360><c> this</c><00:06:52.510><c> question</c><00:06:52.740><c> so</c><00:06:53.740><c> I</c><00:06:54.130><c> definitely</c>

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:54.910 align:start position:0%
answer this question so I definitely
 

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:56.430 align:start position:0%
answer this question so I definitely
advise<00:06:55.180><c> that</c><00:06:55.419><c> you</c><00:06:55.510><c> sort</c><00:06:55.720><c> of</c><00:06:55.780><c> mess</c><00:06:56.020><c> around</c><00:06:56.169><c> with</c>

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:56.440 align:start position:0%
advise that you sort of mess around with
 

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:58.170 align:start position:0%
advise that you sort of mess around with
this<00:06:56.590><c> a</c><00:06:56.650><c> little</c><00:06:56.770><c> bit</c><00:06:57.040><c> you</c><00:06:57.280><c> can</c><00:06:57.430><c> draw</c><00:06:57.669><c> any</c><00:06:57.940><c> kind</c>

00:06:58.170 --> 00:06:58.180 align:start position:0%
this a little bit you can draw any kind
 

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:00.390 align:start position:0%
this a little bit you can draw any kind
of<00:06:58.330><c> graph</c><00:06:58.540><c> you</c><00:06:58.720><c> want</c><00:06:59.040><c> probably</c><00:07:00.040><c> you</c><00:07:00.160><c> want</c><00:07:00.250><c> it</c>

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:00.400 align:start position:0%
of graph you want probably you want it
 

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
of graph you want probably you want it
to<00:07:00.490><c> be</c><00:07:00.610><c> connected</c><00:07:01.090><c> because</c><00:07:01.389><c> that</c><00:07:01.570><c> makes</c><00:07:01.750><c> the</c>

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:01.930 align:start position:0%
to be connected because that makes the
 

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:03.629 align:start position:0%
to be connected because that makes the
game<00:07:02.320><c> a</c><00:07:02.380><c> little</c><00:07:02.560><c> bit</c><00:07:02.740><c> more</c><00:07:02.830><c> interesting</c><00:07:03.400><c> and</c>

00:07:03.629 --> 00:07:03.639 align:start position:0%
game a little bit more interesting and
 

00:07:03.639 --> 00:07:07.020 align:start position:0%
game a little bit more interesting and
assign<00:07:04.419><c> some</c><00:07:04.630><c> numbers</c><00:07:05.520><c> respecting</c><00:07:06.520><c> this</c><00:07:06.639><c> idea</c>

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:07.030 align:start position:0%
assign some numbers respecting this idea
 

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:07.950 align:start position:0%
assign some numbers respecting this idea
that<00:07:07.210><c> okay</c><00:07:07.419><c> you've</c><00:07:07.570><c> got</c><00:07:07.720><c> to</c><00:07:07.840><c> have</c><00:07:07.930><c> enough</c>

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:07.960 align:start position:0%
that okay you've got to have enough
 

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:10.409 align:start position:0%
that okay you've got to have enough
money<00:07:08.290><c> on</c><00:07:08.410><c> the</c><00:07:08.590><c> board</c><00:07:08.830><c> right</c><00:07:09.340><c> and</c><00:07:09.610><c> see</c><00:07:10.270><c> what</c>

00:07:10.409 --> 00:07:10.419 align:start position:0%
money on the board right and see what
 

00:07:10.419 --> 00:07:14.550 align:start position:0%
money on the board right and see what
kind<00:07:10.600><c> of</c><00:07:10.630><c> things</c><00:07:10.690><c> you</c><00:07:10.960><c> end</c><00:07:11.080><c> up</c><00:07:11.200><c> with</c><00:07:12.990><c> yeah</c><00:07:13.990><c> you</c>

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:14.560 align:start position:0%
kind of things you end up with yeah you
 

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:15.810 align:start position:0%
kind of things you end up with yeah you
really<00:07:14.710><c> could</c><00:07:15.070><c> I</c><00:07:15.100><c> mean</c><00:07:15.340><c> it</c><00:07:15.400><c> depends</c><00:07:15.639><c> on</c><00:07:15.700><c> your</c>

one okay very simple to count so let's
 

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:52.320 align:start position:0%
one okay very simple to count so let's

00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:01.360 align:start position:0%

we get zero in this case we've got three
 

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:15.120 align:start position:0%
we get zero in this case we've got three

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:15.130 align:start position:0%
edges three vertices plus 1 so the genus
 

00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:17.760 align:start position:0%
edges three vertices plus 1 so the genus
is<00:08:15.310><c> one</c><00:08:15.550><c> and</c><00:08:15.850><c> so</c><00:08:16.210><c> this</c><00:08:16.720><c> is</c><00:08:16.900><c> giving</c><00:08:17.260><c> me</c><00:08:17.380><c> a</c><00:08:17.410><c> way</c><00:08:17.710><c> to</c>

so here we knew that the game was
 

00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:51.720 align:start position:0%

we know the game is winnable by what I

we know the game is winnable by what I

00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:10.420 align:start position:0%
win the game yeah that's right but I
 

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:11.669 align:start position:0%
win the game yeah that's right but I
could<00:09:10.629><c> have</c><00:09:10.689><c> had</c><00:09:10.869><c> a</c><00:09:10.899><c> three</c><00:09:11.170><c> here</c><00:09:11.350><c> and</c><00:09:11.470><c> it</c><00:09:11.559><c> would</c>

00:09:11.669 --> 00:09:11.679 align:start position:0%
could have had a three here and it would
 

00:09:11.679 --> 00:09:14.160 align:start position:0%
could have had a three here and it would

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:14.170 align:start position:0%
have worked out right and then here in
 

00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:17.160 align:start position:0%
have worked out right and then here in

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:17.170 align:start position:0%
this bad game example it didn't work to
 

00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:19.290 align:start position:0%
this bad game example it didn't work to
just<00:09:17.439><c> have</c><00:09:17.589><c> zero</c><00:09:17.829><c> dollars</c><00:09:18.189><c> on</c><00:09:18.220><c> the</c><00:09:18.429><c> board</c><00:09:18.670><c> but</c>

00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:19.300 align:start position:0%
just have zero dollars on the board but
 

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:21.480 align:start position:0%
just have zero dollars on the board but
here's<00:09:19.600><c> the</c><00:09:19.749><c> reason</c><00:09:20.050><c> why</c><00:09:20.079><c> which</c><00:09:21.040><c> is</c><00:09:21.189><c> that</c><00:09:21.369><c> the</c>

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:21.490 align:start position:0%
here's the reason why which is that the
 

00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:23.699 align:start position:0%
here's the reason why which is that the

00:09:23.699 --> 00:09:23.709 align:start position:0%
genus is one and so in order to win the
 

00:09:23.709 --> 00:09:25.290 align:start position:0%
genus is one and so in order to win the
game<00:09:23.740><c> you've</c><00:09:24.009><c> got</c><00:09:24.040><c> to</c><00:09:24.279><c> have</c><00:09:24.490><c> at</c><00:09:24.610><c> least</c><00:09:24.639><c> one</c>

00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:25.300 align:start position:0%

00:09:28.379 --> 00:09:28.389 align:start position:0%
now the thing that's kind of funny is
 

00:09:28.389 --> 00:09:30.689 align:start position:0%

edges we've got five vertices and we add

00:10:21.689 --> 00:10:21.699 align:start position:0%

00:10:29.249 --> 00:10:29.259 align:start position:0%

have been able to still with it which is
 

00:10:37.959 --> 00:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
have been able to still with it which is

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:39.370 align:start position:0%
weird if you go back and look at this it
 

00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:41.189 align:start position:0%
weird if you go back and look at this it
looks<00:10:39.399><c> a</c><00:10:39.610><c> little</c><00:10:39.790><c> difficult</c><00:10:40.179><c> doesn't</c><00:10:40.389><c> it</c><00:10:40.569><c> yeah</c>

00:10:41.189 --> 00:10:41.199 align:start position:0%
looks a little difficult doesn't it yeah
 

00:10:41.199 --> 00:10:43.949 align:start position:0%
looks a little difficult doesn't it yeah
but<00:10:41.980><c> so</c><00:10:42.429><c> that's</c><00:10:42.579><c> the</c><00:10:42.819><c> guarantees</c><00:10:43.360><c> as</c><00:10:43.629><c> long</c><00:10:43.809><c> as</c>

00:10:43.949 --> 00:10:43.959 align:start position:0%
but so that's the guarantees as long as
 

00:10:43.959 --> 00:10:45.689 align:start position:0%
but so that's the guarantees as long as
you<00:10:44.079><c> draw</c><00:10:44.230><c> yourself</c><00:10:44.290><c> solitaire</c><00:10:45.100><c> graph</c><00:10:45.339><c> which</c>

you draw yourself solitaire graph which

even if it takes you a long time to find
it<00:10:49.720><c> I</c><00:10:49.929><c> think</c><00:10:50.679><c> that</c><00:10:50.829><c> is</c><00:10:50.949><c> the</c><00:10:51.069><c> most</c><00:10:51.220><c> interesting</c>

00:10:51.419 --> 00:10:51.429 align:start position:0%
it I think that is the most interesting
 

00:10:51.429 --> 00:10:53.460 align:start position:0%
it I think that is the most interesting
thing<00:10:51.790><c> is</c><00:10:52.149><c> that</c><00:10:52.179><c> winnable</c><00:10:52.720><c> but</c><00:10:52.899><c> I</c><00:10:52.990><c> also</c><00:10:53.139><c> think</c>

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:53.470 align:start position:0%
thing is that winnable but I also think
 

00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:55.139 align:start position:0%
thing is that winnable but I also think
it's<00:10:53.589><c> incredibly</c><00:10:54.160><c> interesting</c><00:10:54.730><c> on</c><00:10:54.879><c> what</c><00:10:55.029><c> the</c>

00:10:55.139 --> 00:10:55.149 align:start position:0%
it's incredibly interesting on what the
 

00:10:55.149 --> 00:10:57.780 align:start position:0%
it's incredibly interesting on what the
minimal<00:10:55.540><c> number</c><00:10:55.689><c> of</c><00:10:55.869><c> moves</c><00:10:56.110><c> is</c><00:10:56.319><c> yeah</c><00:10:56.740><c> so</c><00:10:57.429><c> even</c>

00:10:57.780 --> 00:10:57.790 align:start position:0%
minimal number of moves is yeah so even
 

00:10:57.790 --> 00:10:59.639 align:start position:0%
minimal number of moves is yeah so even
i<00:10:58.209><c> mentioned</c><00:10:58.689><c> that</c><00:10:58.720><c> is</c><00:10:58.990><c> it</c><00:10:59.230><c> winnable</c><00:10:59.559><c> is</c>

00:10:59.639 --> 00:10:59.649 align:start position:0%
i mentioned that is it winnable is
 

00:10:59.649 --> 00:11:01.470 align:start position:0%
i mentioned that is it winnable is
