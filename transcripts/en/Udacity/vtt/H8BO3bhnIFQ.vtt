00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.980
Now we are ready to create deployments,
one for each service.

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:05.610
Front in, auth, and hello.

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.660
Then will defy internal services for
the off and hello deployments.

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:12.900
And an external service for
the front in deployment.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.149
Let's examine the off
deployment configuration file.

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.250
The first thing I'm going to do is
specify the number of replicas.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.200
This deployment can be used to scale
pods by changing the replica count

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.650
in our manifest.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.950
Moving on, you can see the labels that
will be attached to the off pods.

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:35.090
A little further down you'll see we're
using Version 1.0 of the off container.

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.820
Use the kubectl create command
to create the off deployment.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.800
As with any other kubernetes object,
we can use to describe command

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.900
to see more information
about the off deployment.

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.970
Okay, it's now time to create
a service for off deployment.

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.958
You've already seen service manifest
files, so I won't go into details here.

00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:57.299
Use the kubectl create command
to create the off service.

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.790
Now, I'm going to do the same thing to
create and expose the hello deployment.

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.895
I wanted to repeat these steps one more
time for the front end deployment.

00:01:07.895 --> 00:01:10.790
We'll also need to configure engine X
like we did in the previous tutorial.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.290
Now we are ready to interact with
the front in by grabbing this external

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.290
IP address.

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:18.520
And using curl to hit it.

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.070
Congratulations, you've deployed
the multi-service application using

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.160
kubernetes.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.410
The skills you've learned here will
allow you to deploy complex applications

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:31.200
on kubernetes using a collection
of deployments and services.
