00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.900
Hey there! I am Mike Rugnetta,

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:05.700
and this is going to be Crash Course World Mythology.

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.380
We're gonna learn about the stories that explain

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:10.620
life, the universe, and almost everything.

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.400
We'll explore the beginning of the universe,

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.620
the end of the universe,

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.740
who exactly is running said universe.

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.500
We're gonna address a bunch of questions like

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:18.460
where children come from,

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.040
how we got death and disease,

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.960
and what exactly the deal is with unicorns and virgins.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.360
So, yeah. No big deal.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.060
It probably does seem like a lot

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:30.080
and as it should!

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.600
We really are going to try to emphasize

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.320
the "world" part of world mythology.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.860
We're gonna get into Zeus and Odin

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.680
and their terrible siblings and kids,

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.240
but we're also going to be looking at stories from Japan,

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.820
Sumer, Egypt, Guinea, the Americas, India, and more.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.500
By the time you're seeing this,

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.100
we will have shot only seven episodes

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.480
and look at all of the spots we've already visited!

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:54.640
There's still a lot more to go.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.400
The point, though, isn't to tick

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.580
all of the mythological locales off of

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.300
the geographical list one by one.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.060
We want to zoom out and look at

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:03.660
the entire world of myth

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.060
rather than one tradition at a time

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.760
so we can see the similarities in the stories

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.280
that different peoples tell about the universe.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.900
Even with the vast diversity of stories

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.160
that humans have come up with

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.580
to understand everything around them,

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.460
it turns out that we all have a lot in common.

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.900
Many civilizations search for answers

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.760
to the same questions,

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.100
and what they come up with always teaches us

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.340
something about who the people of that civilization are

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.580
and what they value.

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.100
Our own included.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.600
We're really excited to learn all of this stuff with you:

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.280
How the world was variously created,

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.000
will eventually be destroyed,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.620
and why, in the meantime,

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.900
we have the pleasure of gardening on it.

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:47.340
It's gonna be epic.

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:49.120
Literally.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:56.300
