00:00:00.867 --> 00:00:02.869
- How long have

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:04.771
Um, close to 10 years.

00:00:04.771 --> 00:00:07.707
OK, so you've had it for 10
years, and you preserved it.

00:00:07.707 --> 00:00:09.442
I mean, thank god you
pulled it up on the trailer

00:00:09.442 --> 00:00:11.511
here because I could
see it was starting

00:00:11.511 --> 00:00:12.679
to rot into the ground.

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:17.217
So now that you know
it's the real deal--

00:00:17.217 --> 00:00:18.351
What's the deal?

00:00:18.351 --> 00:00:21.721
So now, everybody's on
board with it is legit,

00:00:21.721 --> 00:00:23.723
this is where the
switch gets flipped.

00:00:23.723 --> 00:00:25.058
We want to buy it.

00:00:25.058 --> 00:00:28.762
Now that it's confirmed
that it is the real van,

00:00:28.762 --> 00:00:32.732
you know, that flips it into
another-- a whole other--

00:00:32.732 --> 00:00:34.100
Category.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.338
In its degraded condition,
it would be very risky to keep

00:00:38.338 --> 00:00:40.774
it out in the open here.

00:00:40.774 --> 00:00:44.544
And I'm always concerned about
vandalism and other things.

00:00:44.544 --> 00:00:47.013
God only knows
what could happen.

00:00:47.013 --> 00:00:50.316
Like, for me personally, and
I know you probably thought

00:00:50.316 --> 00:00:53.820
about this, it's like, the
money shot for this whole thing

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.455
is the side of the van.

00:00:55.455 --> 00:00:58.024
And the story is
extremely powerful.

00:00:58.024 --> 00:00:59.793
But when you look
at the van itself,

00:00:59.793 --> 00:01:04.063
even to present the van, there's
going to be a lot of work done.

00:01:04.063 --> 00:01:05.865
Now I'm not talking
about restoring it,

00:01:05.865 --> 00:01:08.301
but to stabilize the van.

00:01:08.301 --> 00:01:10.236
This would all have
to be stabilized.

00:01:10.236 --> 00:01:11.871
Right.

00:01:11.871 --> 00:01:13.173
I mean, would you
put a number on it?

00:01:13.173 --> 00:01:13.773
Would you sell it?

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:17.777
I would, yeah.

00:01:17.777 --> 00:01:19.412
But as numbers go--

00:01:19.412 --> 00:01:21.181
We know this is
a big decision.

00:01:21.181 --> 00:01:22.882
I know you just--
you've had it 10 years,

00:01:22.882 --> 00:01:25.585
it's hard to make a
decision like, right now.

00:01:25.585 --> 00:01:27.120
I understand it's history.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.357
But what I'm looking at
is the condition of it.

00:01:31.357 --> 00:01:36.162
So where I'd want to
be on it is 22 grand.

00:01:39.833 --> 00:01:42.402
I'm thinking.

00:01:42.402 --> 00:01:46.973
So many things had to happen
to get us to this moment.

00:01:46.973 --> 00:01:49.843
First of all, Danny
basically stumbles

00:01:49.843 --> 00:01:52.579
on a guy that's got a
piece of rock and roll

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:55.248
history sitting in his yard.

00:01:55.248 --> 00:01:58.785
Then I call my buddy, Dan
Auerbach from the Black Keys.

00:01:58.785 --> 00:02:03.523
Dan picks up the phone and calls
Joe Perry, the man himself,

00:02:03.523 --> 00:02:04.858
from Aerosmith.

00:02:04.858 --> 00:02:08.127
The next thing you know, one
of the original band members

00:02:08.127 --> 00:02:10.430
comes to look at it
and authenticates

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:12.065
it right on the spot.

00:02:12.065 --> 00:02:15.468
And all of this happened
in like, two hours.

00:02:15.468 --> 00:02:20.473
This is the universe telling
us we need to own this van.

00:02:20.473 --> 00:02:22.942
It's epic.

00:02:22.942 --> 00:02:24.210
I'll do 25 grand.

00:02:32.285 --> 00:02:33.553
What?

00:02:33.553 --> 00:02:37.991
We just got a piece of
American rock and roll history.

00:02:37.991 --> 00:02:41.594
American rock and roll history.

00:02:41.594 --> 00:02:43.863
When 25 grand
was on the table,

00:02:43.863 --> 00:02:46.566
I think Phil was like,
whoa, I got it, man.

00:02:46.566 --> 00:02:48.034
You got it.

00:02:48.034 --> 00:02:52.071
If you had the opportunity
to buy one of the biggest, most

00:02:52.071 --> 00:02:57.577
iconic pieces of rock and
roll history for 25 grand,

00:02:57.577 --> 00:02:59.479
hell yes you would.

00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:01.748
Dude, I'm thinking we just
had one of the biggest score

00:03:01.748 --> 00:03:04.250
we've had in our lifetime.

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.287
Rock and roll
started in America.

00:03:07.287 --> 00:03:10.256
This is America's
rock and roll band.

00:03:10.256 --> 00:03:13.326
Almost 50 years
ago, a group of guys

00:03:13.326 --> 00:03:15.895
went on the journey of
a lifetime together.

00:03:15.895 --> 00:03:19.098
I'm talking tens of
millions of records sold,

00:03:19.098 --> 00:03:22.869
top 40 hits, Grammys, Rock
and Roll Hall of Fame.

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:26.439
And that journey
started in this band.

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:27.707
How cool is that?

00:03:27.707 --> 00:03:28.875
Are you speechless?

00:03:28.875 --> 00:03:31.477
Dude, I'm still in awe.

00:03:31.477 --> 00:03:35.014
Now that we are the
caretakers of this piece,

00:03:35.014 --> 00:03:37.584
we have to make good
decisions on it.

00:03:37.584 --> 00:03:41.120
The first thing I want to do
is get the van to our metal guy

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.856
and have him assess
the situation.

00:03:43.856 --> 00:03:45.992
It was almost like
that band has been

00:03:45.992 --> 00:03:50.563
sitting in the woods waiting
for us to come rescue it.

00:03:50.563 --> 00:03:54.367
If somebody told you that
this van was in the woods,

00:03:54.367 --> 00:03:56.936
what would you say?

00:03:56.936 --> 00:03:58.571
Dream on.

00:03:58.571 --> 00:04:00.106
You dork.
