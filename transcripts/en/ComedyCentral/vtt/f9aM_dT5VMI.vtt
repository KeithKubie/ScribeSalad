00:00:03.168 --> 00:00:04.504 align:start position:0%
Suck.

00:00:06.606 --> 00:00:09.008 align:start position:0%
So, anyways, I finally got
a meeting with Bellamy,

00:00:09.108 --> 00:00:10.610 align:start position:0%
the bacon bits king.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.612 align:start position:0%
Now, I know
my campaign's awesome.

00:00:12.712 --> 00:00:14.847 align:start position:0%
The problem is,
everybody I talk to says

00:00:14.947 --> 00:00:16.181 align:start position:0%
Bellamy's
a real ball-breaker.

00:00:16.282 --> 00:00:17.416 align:start size:53% position:47%
Yeah, that's what
they say.

00:00:17.516 --> 00:00:18.417 align:start position:0%
Yeah.

00:00:18.517 --> 00:00:19.419 align:start position:0%
Well, Nick,
you're my brother

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:21.053 align:start position:0%
and you're incredibly
successful.

00:00:21.154 --> 00:00:23.155 align:start size:31% position:69%
Yes, I am.

00:00:23.255 --> 00:00:25.057 align:start position:0%
I was hoping that maybe
you could give me some tips

00:00:25.158 --> 00:00:26.859 align:start position:0%
that might give me an edge
when I meet with him.

00:00:26.959 --> 00:00:28.661 align:start size:56% position:44%
Okay, sure.
Here's a good one.

00:00:28.761 --> 00:00:30.663 align:start size:88% position:13%
When you greet him, give him
a good, firm handshake

00:00:30.763 --> 00:00:32.165 align:start size:53% position:47%
and don't release
until he does.

00:00:32.265 --> 00:00:33.566 align:start position:0%
No, no, no, no.
I want something different.

00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:35.835 align:start position:0% line:85%
Something special.

00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:35.835 align:start size:47% position:53%
Wear a red tie.

00:00:35.935 --> 00:00:38.337 align:start position:0%
Power tie,
that's bush league.

00:00:38.437 --> 00:00:40.973 align:start position:0%
I'm talking about
a secret weapon here, Nick.

00:00:41.074 --> 00:00:43.610 align:start size:72% position:28% line:85%
Oh, secret weapon, huh?

00:00:41.074 --> 00:00:43.610 align:start position:0%
Yeah.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.645 align:start size:63% position:38%
Okay, I think I know
what you're after.

00:00:45.745 --> 00:00:46.912 align:end position:100%
But if I tell you,
you gotta promise

00:00:47.012 --> 00:00:48.281 align:start size:41% position:59%
not to tell
anybody else.

00:00:48.381 --> 00:00:49.381 align:start position:0%
I promise.

00:00:49.481 --> 00:00:50.950 align:start size:66% position:34%
This is sort of
a long-term strategy.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:52.118 align:start size:59% position:41%
When's your meeting
with Bellamy?

00:00:52.218 --> 00:00:53.452 align:start position:0%
A week from today.

00:00:53.552 --> 00:00:56.789 align:start size:56% position:44%
Oh, not much time,
but it might work.

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:58.358 align:start size:53% position:47%
Yeah, okay, sure.

00:01:00.126 --> 00:01:03.029 align:start size:81% position:19%
Every time a penny
passes through your hands,

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:04.664 align:start size:66% position:34%
stick it up your ass.

00:01:06.098 --> 00:01:08.134 align:start position:0%
What?

00:01:08.234 --> 00:01:09.536 align:start size:56% position:44%
And then spend it.

00:01:14.573 --> 00:01:15.641 align:start position:0%
(sarcastic)
Thanks, Nick.

00:01:15.741 --> 00:01:18.611 align:start position:0%
Yeah, I thought you were
really gonna help me.

00:01:18.711 --> 00:01:19.913 align:start position:0%
How does sticking pennies
up my ass

00:01:20.013 --> 00:01:21.314 align:start position:0%
give me an edge
when I meet with him?

00:01:21.414 --> 00:01:22.715 align:start size:69% position:31%
You don't just
stick 'em up your ass,

00:01:22.815 --> 00:01:23.916 align:start size:47% position:53%
you spend them.

00:01:24.017 --> 00:01:25.919 align:start size:81% position:19%
Now, like I said,
it's a long-term strategy.

00:01:26.019 --> 00:01:27.853 align:start size:63% position:38%
I've been doing this
for 11 years now.

00:01:27.953 --> 00:01:29.622 align:start size:69% position:31%
Every day
for the past 11 years,

00:01:29.722 --> 00:01:32.057 align:start size:66% position:34%
I've stuffed $30
in pennies up my ass.

00:01:32.158 --> 00:01:35.261 align:start size:81% position:19%
I use 'em for everything--
cab rides, movie theater,
groceries.

00:01:35.361 --> 00:01:37.397 size:81% position:41% line:85%
What does that accomplish?

00:01:35.361 --> 00:01:37.397 align:start size:50% position:50%
Will you listen?

00:01:37.497 --> 00:01:40.233 size:84% position:58%
That's a lot of ass pennies
I got out there, my friend.

00:01:40.333 --> 00:01:42.101 align:start size:59% position:41%
And here's where
the magic comes in.

00:01:42.201 --> 00:01:44.137 align:start size:75% position:25%
When I meet with someone
who intimidates me,

00:01:44.237 --> 00:01:47.707 align:start size:63% position:38%
who puts me on edge,
a real "hard-ass,"

00:01:47.807 --> 00:01:49.108 align:start size:72% position:28%
I just think to myself,

00:01:49.208 --> 00:01:51.477 align:start size:75% position:25%
they've probably handled
one of my ass pennies.

00:01:51.577 --> 00:01:52.879 align:start size:69% position:31%
In fact,
they probably have one

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.380 size:84% position:58%
in their pocket right then.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.415 align:start size:81% position:19%
That just seems to sort of
give me the upper hand.

00:01:56.515 --> 00:01:58.417 align:start size:69% position:31%
I mean, hey, I haven't
touched anything

00:01:58.517 --> 00:02:00.285 align:start size:78% position:22%
that's been in their ass.

00:02:00.386 --> 00:02:02.321 align:start size:63% position:38%
Hey, where's Bellamy
like to eat?

00:02:02.421 --> 00:02:04.090 align:start position:0%
He likes to eat
at the Pump Room.

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:05.425 align:start size:59% position:41%
Great,
here's what you do.

00:02:05.525 --> 00:02:08.027 align:start size:88% position:13%
Go to the bank today.
Get yourself $50 in pennies.

00:02:08.127 --> 00:02:09.195 align:start size:41% position:59%
Stick 'em all
up your ass.

00:02:09.295 --> 00:02:11.764 align:start position:0% line:78%
Oh, please...

00:02:09.295 --> 00:02:11.764 align:start size:44% position:56%
One at a time,
of course.

00:02:11.864 --> 00:02:14.399 size:84% position:58%
You go to the Pump Room,
buy yourself a nice dinner,

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.201 align:start size:47% position:53%
paying entirely
in pennies.

00:02:16.302 --> 00:02:18.671 align:start size:72% position:28%
Now, they'll be
using your pennies for
the next week at least.

00:02:18.771 --> 00:02:20.372 align:start size:66% position:34%
Bellamy goes in there
to eat.

00:02:20.472 --> 00:02:22.642 align:start size:75% position:25%
He gets your ass pennies
for change.

00:02:22.742 --> 00:02:23.810 align:start size:56% position:44%
By the time
you meet with him,

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.611 align:start size:66% position:34%
you know he's had
something in his hand

00:02:25.712 --> 00:02:27.780 align:start size:47% position:53%
that you've had
in your ass.

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.383 align:start position:0% line:78%
So?

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.383 align:start size:47% position:53%
So then you got
the upper hand.

00:02:30.483 --> 00:02:31.884 align:start position:0% line:85%
No, I don't.

00:02:30.483 --> 00:02:31.884 align:start size:41% position:59%
Yeah, you do.

00:02:31.984 --> 00:02:34.086 size:84% position:58%
It's just like imagining
someone in their underwear.

00:02:34.186 --> 00:02:35.521 align:end size:47% position:47%
No, it's not!
It's horrible!

00:02:35.621 --> 00:02:37.056 align:start size:50% position:50%
Yeah, well,
it works for me.

00:02:37.156 --> 00:02:38.691 align:start position:0%
(scoffs)

00:02:38.791 --> 00:02:41.560 align:start position:0%
You know what?
I used to look up to you.

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.429 align:start position:0%
I used to think you really
had it together.

00:02:43.529 --> 00:02:45.898 align:start size:81% position:19%
Oh, I do have it together,
little brother.

00:02:45.998 --> 00:02:48.267 align:end position:100%
You don't pull down
eight figures a year

00:02:48.368 --> 00:02:49.769 align:start size:53% position:47%
without having it
to-gether.

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:50.903 align:start position:0%
You don't have it
together, Nick.

00:02:51.003 --> 00:02:53.205 align:start position:0%
You stick pennies
up your ass for confidence.

00:02:53.305 --> 00:02:55.908 align:start position:0%
That's not having it
together!

00:02:56.008 --> 00:02:58.177
Do you think you're
better than me?

00:02:58.277 --> 00:02:59.379 align:start size:56% position:44%
I didn't say that.

00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:00.879 align:start position:0%
Oh, you didn't have to.

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.048 align:start position:0%
It's written
all over your face.

00:03:03.148 --> 00:03:04.283 align:start position:0%
You have any change
in your pocket?

00:03:04.383 --> 00:03:05.284 align:start size:13% position:88%
Why?

00:03:05.384 --> 00:03:06.452 align:start position:0% line:92%
Take it out.

00:03:05.384 --> 00:03:06.452 align:start size:31% position:69%
Why?

00:03:06.552 --> 00:03:09.656 align:start position:0%
Go on. Take it out
and take a good look at it.

00:03:11.123 --> 00:03:12.425
(coins jingling)

00:03:12.525 --> 00:03:14.127 align:start position:0%
Oh, my.

00:03:14.227 --> 00:03:16.862 align:start position:0%
You've got a few pennies
in there, don't you?

00:03:16.962 --> 00:03:18.897 align:start position:0%
I've been sticking
$30 in pennies up my ass

00:03:18.997 --> 00:03:20.866 align:start position:0%
for the past 11 years.

00:03:20.966 --> 00:03:23.202 align:start position:0%
That's 3,000 pennies
a day.

00:03:23.302 --> 00:03:25.104 align:start position:0%
21,000 pennies a week.

00:03:25.204 --> 00:03:28.341 align:start position:0%
1,092,000 pennies
a year.

00:03:28.441 --> 00:03:31.144 align:start position:0%
To date,
that's 12,012,000 pennies,

00:03:31.244 --> 00:03:33.646 align:start position:0%
eight times the population
of Nebraska.

00:03:33.746 --> 00:03:35.581 align:start position:0%
Those pennies
were in my ass!

00:03:35.682 --> 00:03:37.149 align:start position:0%
You think you're better
than me?

00:03:37.249 --> 00:03:38.817 align:start position:0%
Oh, you're not
better than me.

00:03:38.917 --> 00:03:41.420 align:start position:0%
You handle my ass pennies
every day.

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.789 align:start position:0%
You pick up my ass pennies
for good luck.

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:45.625 align:start position:0%
You throw my ass pennies
in fountains

00:03:45.725 --> 00:03:46.959 size:75% position:38%
and make wishes on them.

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.995 align:start position:0%
You give my ass pennies
to your little daughter

00:03:49.095 --> 00:03:50.930 align:start position:0% line:85%
to buy gumballs...

00:03:49.095 --> 00:03:50.930 align:start size:22% position:78%
Ugh...!

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.099
You handle my ass pennies
every day.

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:54.433
All of you!

00:03:54.533 --> 00:03:57.736
You all handle my ass pennies!

00:03:57.837 --> 00:04:00.373
I'll laugh at you
before you can laugh at me.

00:04:00.473 --> 00:04:03.542
Because your pennies
have been in my ass.

00:04:03.642 --> 00:04:04.642
<i> You hear me?</i>
