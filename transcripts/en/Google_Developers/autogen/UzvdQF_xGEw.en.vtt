performance measures right and then we
get a score based on those performance

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:43.100
get a score based on those performance
 

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:44.950

have a score for the enterprise and it's
 

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:12.400
have a score for the enterprise and it's
okay so the enterprise is performing at

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:12.410
okay so the enterprise is performing at
 

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:14.470
okay so the enterprise is performing at
80 out of 100 of that got it and so then

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:14.480
80 out of 100 of that got it and so then
 

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:18.520
80 out of 100 of that got it and so then
you can really direct your your actions

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:18.530
you can really direct your your actions
 

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:20.470
you can really direct your your actions
so we put all the performance measures

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:20.480
so we put all the performance measures
 

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:23.650
so we put all the performance measures
in one spreadsheet and we pulled these

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:23.660
in one spreadsheet and we pulled these
 

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:26.050
in one spreadsheet and we pulled these
in each appraisal creation spreadsheet

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:26.060
in each appraisal creation spreadsheet
 

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:28.150
in each appraisal creation spreadsheet
and we were able to give one per team or

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:28.160
and we were able to give one per team or
 

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.190
and we were able to give one per team or
about 900 people in your organization

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:30.200
about 900 people in your organization
 

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:33.250
about 900 people in your organization
about 18 to 20 teams rather than build a

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:33.260
about 18 to 20 teams rather than build a
 

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.620
about 18 to 20 teams rather than build a
system which was going to go across all

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:35.630
system which was going to go across all
 

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:37.180
system which was going to go across all
teams in one go we were able to then

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:37.190
teams in one go we were able to then
 

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:39.010
teams in one go we were able to then
pilot it with the first three or four

00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:39.020
pilot it with the first three or four
 

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:41.470
pilot it with the first three or four
teams and once we were able to pilot it

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:41.480
teams and once we were able to pilot it
 

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:44.770
teams and once we were able to pilot it
then we refined the data model and so we

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:44.780
then we refined the data model and so we
 

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:46.420
then we refined the data model and so we
used libraries for that so we have a

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:46.430
used libraries for that so we have a
 

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:50.560
used libraries for that so we have a
spreadsheet handle library which is used

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:50.570
spreadsheet handle library which is used
 

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:52.090
spreadsheet handle library which is used
by all the spreadsheets so that

00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:52.100
by all the spreadsheets so that
 

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:54.190
by all the spreadsheets so that
basically we can do the change in the

00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:54.200
basically we can do the change in the
 

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:55.960
basically we can do the change in the
code there and all the spreadsheets

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:55.970
code there and all the spreadsheets
 

00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:58.810
code there and all the spreadsheets
inherit from that code that particular

00:07:58.810 --> 00:07:58.820
inherit from that code that particular
 

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:02.500
inherit from that code that particular
library would then use another library

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:02.510
library would then use another library
 

00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:04.150
library would then use another library
for its database and we started with

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:04.160
for its database and we started with
 

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:07.180
for its database and we started with
scriptdb because scriptdb is quick

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:07.190
scriptdb because scriptdb is quick
 

00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:08.890
scriptdb because scriptdb is quick
efficient allows us to do rapid

00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:08.900
efficient allows us to do rapid
 

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:10.600
efficient allows us to do rapid
prototyping on the data model we can

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:10.610
prototyping on the data model we can
 

00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:13.660
prototyping on the data model we can
update that data model as and when we

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:13.670
update that data model as and when we
 

00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:17.110
update that data model as and when we
want and then for so that's I'm gonna

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:17.120
want and then for so that's I'm gonna
 

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:19.360
want and then for so that's I'm gonna
prepare my appraisal I'm gonna say for

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:19.370
prepare my appraisal I'm gonna say for
 

00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:21.220
prepare my appraisal I'm gonna say for
employee of type a these are the

00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:21.230
employee of type a these are the
 

00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:22.930
employee of type a these are the
performance measures that they need and

00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:22.940
performance measures that they need and
 

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:25.450
performance measures that they need and
now on a quarterly basis I'm just gonna

00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:25.460
now on a quarterly basis I'm just gonna
 

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:28.210
now on a quarterly basis I'm just gonna
as a manager have a tablet and walk up

00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:28.220
as a manager have a tablet and walk up
 

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:30.490
as a manager have a tablet and walk up
to the employee and spend a 3 minute or

00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:30.500
to the employee and spend a 3 minute or
 

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:32.590
to the employee and spend a 3 minute or
literally 3 minutes to do the appraisal

00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:32.600
literally 3 minutes to do the appraisal
 

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:34.570
literally 3 minutes to do the appraisal
with him and give him that feedback and

00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:34.580
with him and give him that feedback and
 

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:37.270
with him and give him that feedback and
so we used HTML service for that again

00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:37.280
so we used HTML service for that again
 

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:39.910
so we used HTML service for that again
HTML service was able to use the same

00:08:39.910 --> 00:08:39.920
HTML service was able to use the same
 

00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:41.430
HTML service was able to use the same
library to

00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:41.440
library to
 

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:44.640
library to
scriptdb and then we had you know a

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:44.650
scriptdb and then we had you know a
 

00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:47.460
scriptdb and then we had you know a
tablet based a tablet based application

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:47.470
tablet based a tablet based application
 

00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:48.630
tablet based a tablet based application
let's take a quick look yes that's

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:48.640
let's take a quick look yes that's
 

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:52.230
let's take a quick look yes that's
awesome yeah which one is it and that's

00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:52.240
awesome yeah which one is it and that's
 

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:52.680
awesome yeah which one is it and that's
it

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:52.690
it
 

00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:59.160
it
Wow and so we just fill this up scores

00:08:59.160 --> 00:08:59.170
Wow and so we just fill this up scores
 

00:08:59.170 --> 00:09:02.610
Wow and so we just fill this up scores
are calculated on the fly I call this is

00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:02.620
are calculated on the fly I call this is
 

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:05.100
are calculated on the fly I call this is
all HTML service HTML service older way

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:05.110
all HTML service HTML service older way
 

00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:07.410
all HTML service HTML service older way
great and this works on a tablet and it

00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:07.420
great and this works on a tablet and it
 

00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:08.970
great and this works on a tablet and it
works on this obviously and then you

00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:08.980
works on this obviously and then you
 

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:11.490
works on this obviously and then you
save not sure that's gonna work because

00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:11.500
save not sure that's gonna work because
 

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:13.200
save not sure that's gonna work because
I might you know okay it's been

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:13.210
I might you know okay it's been
 

00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:15.630
I might you know okay it's been
successful and then at the same time

00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:15.640
successful and then at the same time
 

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:19.410
successful and then at the same time
once you do that that sends it to a

00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:19.420
once you do that that sends it to a
 

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:22.370
once you do that that sends it to a
report Handler and then you know you can

00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:22.380
report Handler and then you know you can
 

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:25.110
report Handler and then you know you can
just see the email that's okay these are

00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:25.120
just see the email that's okay these are
 

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:30.300
just see the email that's okay these are
your your your results and let you have

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:30.310
your your your results and let you have
 

00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:31.740
your your your results and let you have
a spreadsheet here as well where all

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:31.750
a spreadsheet here as well where all
 

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:33.990
a spreadsheet here as well where all
this is maintained yeah and so each team

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:34.000
this is maintained yeah and so each team
 

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.810
this is maintained yeah and so each team
gets the spreadsheet where they're able

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:36.820
gets the spreadsheet where they're able
 

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:39.360
gets the spreadsheet where they're able
to pull the performance items so the

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:39.370
to pull the performance items so the
 

00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:42.230
to pull the performance items so the
performance items are pulled here with

00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:42.240
performance items are pulled here with
 

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:44.880
performance items are pulled here with
the import range another spreadsheet

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:44.890
the import range another spreadsheet
 

00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:47.250
the import range another spreadsheet
cool and fills that up so everybody's

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:47.260
cool and fills that up so everybody's
 

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.520
cool and fills that up so everybody's
got the same performance items and

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:49.530
got the same performance items and
 

00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:52.590
got the same performance items and
basically you create this for one

00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:52.600
basically you create this for one
 

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:55.860
basically you create this for one
quarter and then you keep saving it on

00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:55.870
quarter and then you keep saving it on
 

00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:57.360
quarter and then you keep saving it on
every quarter so you don't have to read

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:57.370
every quarter so you don't have to read
 

00:09:57.370 --> 00:10:01.710
every quarter so you don't have to read
with this form over and over again very

00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:01.720
with this form over and over again very
 

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:04.170
with this form over and over again very
cool I think one of the most exciting

00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:04.180
cool I think one of the most exciting
 

00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:05.790
cool I think one of the most exciting
things that happened is though so we

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:05.800
things that happened is though so we
 

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:08.910
things that happened is though so we
released this this product to the teams

00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:08.920
released this this product to the teams
 

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:10.950
released this this product to the teams
they did a couple of appraisals and then

00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:10.960
they did a couple of appraisals and then
 

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:13.290
they did a couple of appraisals and then
we went to the CEO and he said well I

00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:13.300
we went to the CEO and he said well I
 

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:14.520
we went to the CEO and he said well I
don't want this quarterly I want this

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:14.530
don't want this quarterly I want this
 

00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:17.850
don't want this quarterly I want this
monthly and here we hit we hit the

00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:17.860
monthly and here we hit we hit the
 

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:21.030
monthly and here we hit we hit the
limitation of scriptdb because the

00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:21.040
limitation of scriptdb because the
 

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:23.820
limitation of scriptdb because the
maximum commit is 4k for the first and

00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:23.830
maximum commit is 4k for the first and
 

00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:25.620
maximum commit is 4k for the first and
then it's another 4k and so we were

00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:25.630
then it's another 4k and so we were
 

00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:28.020
then it's another 4k and so we were
hitting the 7k limit quite quite

00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:28.030
hitting the 7k limit quite quite
 

00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:29.550
hitting the 7k limit quite quite
frequently so the system when we went

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:29.560
frequently so the system when we went
 

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:31.850
frequently so the system when we went
from quarterly to monthly appraisals

00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:31.860
from quarterly to monthly appraisals
 

00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:35.100
from quarterly to monthly appraisals
broke down and so like the team came up

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:35.110
broke down and so like the team came up
 

00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:36.420
broke down and so like the team came up
to me and said so what are we gonna do

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:36.430
to me and said so what are we gonna do
 

00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:39.270
to me and said so what are we gonna do
and because we were using scriptdb which

00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:39.280
and because we were using scriptdb which
 

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:43.920
and because we were using scriptdb which
is no sequel database the port to Google

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:43.930
is no sequel database the port to Google
 

00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:46.380
is no sequel database the port to Google
App Engine was basically instantaneous

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:46.390
App Engine was basically instantaneous
 

00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:47.970
App Engine was basically instantaneous
and if we look at and you designed it

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:47.980
and if we look at and you designed it
 

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:50.400
and if we look at and you designed it
smartly with the libraries yeah so all

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:50.410
smartly with the libraries yeah so all
 

00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:52.590
smartly with the libraries yeah so all
we needed to do was to swap the library

00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:52.600
we needed to do was to swap the library
 

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:53.490
we needed to do was to swap the library
here we have two

00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:53.500
here we have two
 

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:57.810
here we have two
this was G this was the scriptdb library

00:10:57.810 --> 00:10:57.820
this was G this was the scriptdb library
 

00:10:57.820 --> 00:10:59.400
this was G this was the scriptdb library
so we see each function like get

00:10:59.400 --> 00:10:59.410
so we see each function like get
 

00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:03.900
so we see each function like get
employee and then we query the DB and

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:03.910
employee and then we query the DB and
 

00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:06.150
employee and then we query the DB and
then if we go to the Google App Engine

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:06.160
then if we go to the Google App Engine
 

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:08.850
then if we go to the Google App Engine
implementation we have exactly the same

00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:08.860
implementation we have exactly the same
 

00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:11.030
implementation we have exactly the same
exactly the same signature so the API

00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:11.040
exactly the same signature so the API
 

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:14.580
exactly the same signature so the API
was consistent so we just needed to do

00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:14.590
was consistent so we just needed to do
 

00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:19.050
was consistent so we just needed to do
the basically URL fetch we've got at the

00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:19.060
the basically URL fetch we've got at the
 

00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:20.490
the basically URL fetch we've got at the
top of the screen which are not screen

00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:20.500
top of the screen which are not screen
 

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:25.110
top of the screen which are not screen
not seen the the secret key and don't

00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:25.120
not seen the the secret key and don't
 

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:26.310
not seen the the secret key and don't
want to share that yeah we don't want to

00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:26.320
want to share that yeah we don't want to
 

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:29.040
want to share that yeah we don't want to
share that god and then inside of the

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:29.050
share that god and then inside of the
 

00:11:29.050 --> 00:11:31.230
share that god and then inside of the
spreadsheet handler we just included the

00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:31.240
spreadsheet handler we just included the
 

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:34.200
spreadsheet handler we just included the
the library and kept the same identifier

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:34.210
the library and kept the same identifier
 

00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:36.840
the library and kept the same identifier
we had known basically no code to to

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:36.850
we had known basically no code to to
 

00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:38.820
we had known basically no code to to
change and I think we did this in a

00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:38.830
change and I think we did this in a
 

00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:41.070
change and I think we did this in a
couple of hours cool and you are calling

00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:41.080
couple of hours cool and you are calling
 

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:43.260
