00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.029
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:02.029 --> 00:00:03.570
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
Ubiquitous computing,

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.350
or the internet of
things, is all about

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:08.210
having technology
wherever and whenever

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:09.800
that you might want or need it.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.280
And that's so that we,
as users, can focus more

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.107
on what we're doing and less
on how to start doing it.

00:00:15.107 --> 00:00:17.190
That could be anywhere;
it could be on your wrist,

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.420
in the living room, in your
car-- anywhere and everywhere

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:21.469
that makes sense.

00:00:21.469 --> 00:00:23.010
WAYNE PIEKARSKI:
For developers, this

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.120
means thinking less
about developing an app

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.250
and more about solving a
user's problem, whatever

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:28.450
they happen to be doing.

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:29.866
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
And the trick here

00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:32.220
is that there's new
paradigms for all of this.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.700
It's not just about sitting
down at a desk with a keyboard

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:35.410
anymore.

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.640
How can we use speech, gestures,
context, and glanceable UIs

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.440
to make an effortless experience
for the user, whomever

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:43.191
they happen to be.

00:00:43.191 --> 00:00:45.106
WAYNE PIEKARSKI: It used
to be that you needed

00:00:45.106 --> 00:00:47.020
to build your own
hardware, libraries,

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.650
and infrastructure to build
these kinds of experiences

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:50.550
for your users.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.400
But now, the Google platform
provides a ton of functionality

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.660
so that you can build these
experiences without having

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:56.775
to reinvent the wheel.

00:00:56.775 --> 00:00:59.150
TIMOTHY JORDAN: In our DevBytes,
blog posts, communities,

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.570
and design sprints we're
addressing these key issues,

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.570
so you have all the tools you
need to navigate the space

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.610
and get the most out
of your integration

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:08.840
with the Google platform.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.506
WAYNE PIEKARSKI: So
look for more videos

00:01:10.506 --> 00:01:14.330
on Android Wear, Google Cast,
Android TV, Android Auto,

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.910
and more on the Google
Developers YouTube channel.

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.920
Great experiences on Android
TV are casual, cinematic,

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.220
and simple.

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:25.760
TIMOTHY JORDAN: In
a cinematic app,

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.800
the interface should fade
away, putting content front

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.480
and center.
