1
00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:02.670
Okay.

2
00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:06.690
So now we have a number of different perspectives we can take on understanding

3
00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:09.570
what holds molecules together.
That is on bonding.

4
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.020
We can look at the real molecule,
for example,

5
00:00:13.021 --> 00:00:17.220
with X-ray or,
uh,
we can,
uh,

6
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.810
we can do a computer calculation and if we do a careful enough computer

7
00:00:21.811 --> 00:00:25.710
calculation,
we can get something that we believe is pretty close to reality.

8
00:00:25.711 --> 00:00:30.420
Like the total electron density I showed you.
Right?
Uh,
and the,

9
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.010
the goal of the computer is to approximate the Schrodinger equation.

10
00:00:35.011 --> 00:00:38.040
You can't do it.
Absolutely.
But you can,
you can,

11
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.650
depending on how much computer power you want to throw at it,

12
00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.790
you can do it close enough for most purposes.
Okay.

13
00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.680
But you're neither the molecule while you are a molecule.
But,
uh,

14
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.970
you're neither the kind of molecule we're studying.
Nor are you're a computer.

15
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.080
Are you a computer?
You're a chemist.
And your goal is to understand things.

16
00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.490
Let the computer do the heavy lifting mathematically and you understand it.

17
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:03.271
Okay.

18
00:01:03.271 --> 00:01:08.100
So let's see if we can understand some of the things that we didn't understand

19
00:01:08.101 --> 00:01:11.580
when we were looking at the molecule really with ex-ray diffraction,

20
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.210
right when we were looking at,

21
00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.020
we looked at this molecule and said that the bonding from the Lewis point of

22
00:01:19.021 --> 00:01:22.500
view was pathological.
And you remember how we saw that?

23
00:01:22.501 --> 00:01:26.760
We looked at a cross section through those three atoms and it looked like that

24
00:01:26.761 --> 00:01:29.820
in the electron difference density.
And you remember what's funny about it?

25
00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.080
What's pathological data?

26
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.570
Some of the bonds are bent and what else?
And one bond is missing.

27
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.590
So that bond isn't there.
And the electron density,

28
00:01:46.591 --> 00:01:49.440
the difference density,
and those are bent there.

29
00:01:49.441 --> 00:01:51.810
They don't lie on the line between the nuclei.

30
00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.090
Now can we understand that from the point of view of molecular orbitals of

31
00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.310
Schrodinger's equation,
why it should look like that in this particular case?
Uh,

32
00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.680
so would a computer's molecular orbitals provide understanding?

33
00:02:04.681 --> 00:02:08.190
So I was just showing you as the class assembled how you get these molecular

34
00:02:08.191 --> 00:02:10.770
orbitals and I was showing you some of them.
And one,

35
00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.790
there's the framework of the molecule super imposed on this map.
And those,

36
00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.570
that triangle on top there on the right is what we're looking at.

37
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.960
And so we could look at the 32nd of the 33 occupied orbitals the next to the

38
00:02:25.261 --> 00:02:28.320
highest occupied orbital.
And it looks like that.

39
00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.270
That's the one we were just looking at before we went onto the PowerPoint.

40
00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.100
And you see there is electron density in those,
uh,
the,

41
00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.610
the wave function has big value in the region where those bonds are bent,

42
00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.880
but they're 33 of these occupied orbitals and they put electron density every

43
00:02:46.891 --> 00:02:47.724
which way.

44
00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:52.020
And it's very difficult to understand why this is the way it is,

45
00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.700
why it's been even if you grant,
which is not easy to grant,

46
00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.910
that this is the proper orbital to look and that indeed the electron density of

47
00:03:02.321 --> 00:03:06.640
that red and blue,
big red and blue lobes are not on the line between,

48
00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.820
between we don't know why they are right.

49
00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.890
And there's so much other electron density,

50
00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.510
the motto molecule with all complicated nodes that it's very difficult to know

51
00:03:16.511 --> 00:03:21.310
where to look.
Right?
So,
uh,
the answer is no.

52
00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:26.140
It doesn't provide understanding that it gives far too complicated than answer.

53
00:03:26.141 --> 00:03:30.640
It doesn't tell you why.
Even if you believe that it gives you the right numbers.

54
00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.880
It doesn't tell you why.
Okay.

55
00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.810
But analysis in terms of pairwise,

56
00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.880
that is don't go over the whole molecule.

57
00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.140
Just look at two Adams adjacent to one another,
making a bond.

58
00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.120
So just a very local view.
Pairwise bonding overlap of hybrid.

59
00:03:49.121 --> 00:03:52.900
Atomic orbitals explains these two pathologies.

60
00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.300
So let's look first.

61
00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:00.660
I will assert that the best overlap you can get between a hybrid orbitals on

62
00:04:02.741 --> 00:04:05.410
these carbons.
If the,

63
00:04:05.411 --> 00:04:10.000
if the nuclei are arranged in an equal lateral triangle.
So 60 degree angles,

64
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:11.380
the best hybrids,

65
00:04:11.381 --> 00:04:15.520
you can get points at the angles shown by the red arrows here.

66
00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.090
That's they do it in order to get the best overlap.

67
00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:25.290
Now this seems funny because the angle between the red arrows on the right

68
00:04:26.051 --> 00:04:28.450
carbon is greater than 90 degrees.

69
00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.590
Why do I say it's funny that it's greater that you're not going to be able to

70
00:04:32.591 --> 00:04:33.880
make it 60 degrees?

71
00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:40.170
Because two orbitals that made a 60 degree angle would not be independent

72
00:04:40.811 --> 00:04:45.370
orbitals.
They would be very,
obviously,
if they were right on top of one another,

73
00:04:45.371 --> 00:04:46.660
they'd be the same orbital,

74
00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:50.350
but you can't say they're not the same word bill if they're just a little bit of

75
00:04:50.351 --> 00:04:52.900
way,
because still they're mostly the same orbital.

76
00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:56.470
It's only once they get the 90 degrees that they could be different.

77
00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:01.500
What would the orbitals B that would be independent of one another at 90 degrees

78
00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:07.720
p orbitals.
Right,
so 90 degrees is this smallest angle you could get.

79
00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:12.610
Why don't you use 90 degrees?
Why do you use greater than 90 degrees?
Okay,

80
00:05:12.611 --> 00:05:16.720
that's the question.
Why not use P orbitals and make the smallest angle you can?

81
00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.480
Does anybody see by that is

82
00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:27.280
here.
There there's a PR battle that points at 90 degrees.

83
00:05:27.281 --> 00:05:28.550
You see that it's access.

84
00:05:28.551 --> 00:05:33.551
The yellow axis is a little bit inside the red Arrow and the blue access,

85
00:05:33.791 --> 00:05:38.020
which would be another p orbital perpendicular to that one is a little inside

86
00:05:38.021 --> 00:05:42.220
the other red era.
They make an angle of 90 degrees.
Got It.

87
00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:47.440
Now,
why don't the Adams used p orbitals to make the smallest possible angle?

88
00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:50.740
Can anybody see why that won't give the best overlap?

89
00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.230
How could you change the orbital so as to get better overlap?

90
00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:02.200
[inaudible]

91
00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:11.470
uh,
uh,

92
00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:16.840
number that depends on the distance and they're very close to one another and it

93
00:06:18.291 --> 00:06:22.700
turns out it might be that at this angle,
if you use the s on one of the,

94
00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:26.450
on one of the carbons and the P on another,

95
00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:30.950
it might be that you would get better overlap.
It's,
I don't know that it's true,

96
00:06:30.951 --> 00:06:33.200
but it's,
it's not implausible.

97
00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:38.500
But what would be wrong about using this p orbital from that carbon and on the

98
00:06:38.631 --> 00:06:42.470
top one of the triangle using an s,
which might give better overlap.

99
00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:44.840
Can you see what's bad about that?

100
00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:49.160
If you use all the assets of that top carbon there,

101
00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:53.720
you can't use any of it to make any of the other bonds from that carbon.

102
00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:58.820
Right?
All you have left over on that one is,
is which give crummy overlap.

103
00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:02.930
So even though you might be able to make this single overlap better,

104
00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:07.250
you couldn't make all the bonds strong from that top carbon so you wouldn't get

105
00:07:07.251 --> 00:07:10.460
the best overall overlap.
So that's a good suggestion.

106
00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:15.710
But there's another way to do it,
which is to use a hybrid orbital.

107
00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:19.350
Now here we've put in a little bit,
uh,

108
00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:24.360
a little bit less than 20% of s to give the ratio s p 4.1 right?

109
00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:29.000
But notice that it really distorted.

110
00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:33.320
It made it much larger in the region where we're interested in an overlapping,

111
00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:35.180
right?
In the process,

112
00:07:35.181 --> 00:07:40.181
the axis moved out right to where the red Arrow it close to where the Red Arrow

113
00:07:40.671 --> 00:07:42.200
is.
Right?

114
00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:46.880
But even though the bonds didn't point,
let's see like this,

115
00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:51.980
even though the bonds didn't point at one another,
right?
By extending,

116
00:07:51.981 --> 00:07:54.230
they overlap more.
Got The idea.

117
00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:59.060
So the hybridization by shifting it to one side gives better overlap,

118
00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:03.800
even though the angle might not be quite as good.
Okay.
So that's,

119
00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:09.280
so you have bent bonds paradoxically enough in order to get the best overlap.

120
00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:14.983
Isn't that funny?

121
00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:18.020
You'd think the best overlap would be when they'd point at one another.

122
00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:22.520
But you get better when they make an angle because they stretch out.
Okay,

123
00:08:22.521 --> 00:08:26.060
so that explains the bent bonds.
Now how about the missing bond?

124
00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:28.071
Well again,

125
00:08:28.071 --> 00:08:32.570
we can see that in hybridization because what's left over after you make those

126
00:08:32.571 --> 00:08:35.570
sp four point ones,
three of them

127
00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:38.330
pointing up from the,

128
00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:41.900
from the bottom carbon after you make three sp four point ones.

129
00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:47.260
What you have left over is an sp 1.4 and it points down not up.

130
00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:54.170
If it pointed up,
if the blue big blue lobe we're up in the red down,

131
00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:57.570
then it would part of those other three orbitals.

132
00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:02.610
The only way you could make it point up is to make the other's point down.

133
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:06.030
Right.
And then they would have crummy overlap.

134
00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:10.200
So there's very poor overlap between the tiny lobes of these two.

135
00:09:10.201 --> 00:09:12.360
So there's not enough overlap to get a bond.

136
00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:16.800
You don't don't stabilize the electrons because there's,
you don't have overlap.

137
00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:17.790
Right.

138
00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:22.790
And Re hybridizing this one to strengthen this particular bond by making it

139
00:09:23.221 --> 00:09:27.180
point up would drastically weaken all the others.

140
00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:30.390
Making them point down.
Right?

141
00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:35.720
So the best overall overlap for all the payers that are involved in these bonds

142
00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:41.010
is to have one bond not there or to have very,

143
00:09:41.011 --> 00:09:44.490
very poor overlaps so that the other three are very good.
Sam,

144
00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:50.170
<v 1>I ever done the other two.
If you get sp fourth wave one,</v>

145
00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:56.750
and if I understood that that shifts the electrons towards the other end.
Okay,

146
00:09:57.230 --> 00:10:00.420
but how does that shifting distorted?

147
00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:06.880
<v 0>Remember the angle between hybrids depends on m and N.
Dot.</v>

148
00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:11.990
SPM and Spn,
we did that last time.
If it's pure P,
it's 90 degrees.

149
00:10:11.991 --> 00:10:14.780
If it's sp three sp three it's a,

150
00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:19.910
it's a a hundred it's 109 and a half.
If it's sp two sp two it's 120 and so on.

151
00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:24.980
If it's sp 4.1 it makes that certain angle that shown they're bigger than 90

152
00:10:24.981 --> 00:10:27.110
degrees.
Okay.

153
00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:31.910
And that the only reason for that is so that these hybrids will be different

154
00:10:31.911 --> 00:10:34.640
from one another.
They won't be the same.
Right.

155
00:10:34.641 --> 00:10:39.050
They won't overlap each other on the same Adam because to the extent they do,

156
00:10:39.051 --> 00:10:41.810
they're the same.
And so they can't at all.

157
00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:44.420
They have to be orthogonal if they're on the same Adam.

158
00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:50.190
Okay.
Now three views of Bh.

159
00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:54.030
Three first nature,

160
00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:55.710
that total electron density.

161
00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:59.640
I'm going over the same thing again and again here with different examples.

162
00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:03.210
First look at total electron density nature.

163
00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:06.780
Then we'll look at molecular orbitals.
That's what a computer does.

164
00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:12.080
And then we'll look at bonds from hybrid atomic orbitals and that's what we do

165
00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:15.390
as chemists.
Okay.

166
00:11:15.391 --> 00:11:20.280
First we'll look at the electron cloud of Bh three calculated here on using that

167
00:11:20.281 --> 00:11:21.780
same program I just showed you.

168
00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:29.110
So we can look at the success of uh,
layers of the onion,
right?

169
00:11:29.111 --> 00:11:33.070
The high electron density,
lower,
lower,
lower,
lower,
the various contours.

170
00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:37.780
So this lowest one is mostly one s of Boron,

171
00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:40.780
but a little bit of the one s as of hydrogen to,

172
00:11:40.781 --> 00:11:44.320
and one of them doesn't even show up because it's so small.

173
00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:49.070
All the hydrogens should be the same.
But that the graphing,
uh,

174
00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:53.710
capability of the computer for something that's,
that has as few as this,

175
00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:58.300
the way it draws surfaces doesn't draw them smooth,
right?
It connects points.

176
00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:03.160
So it doesn't even show one of those.
Nobody would ever make such a plot.
Okay.

177
00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:06.850
Down at that,
that's 0.3 electrons per cubic Hong strum.

178
00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:11.980
So suppose we go to 0.15 electrons per cubic songs strum half that density.

179
00:12:11.981 --> 00:12:16.720
Now we're beginning to get smoother surfaces and it's on the Boron is one s of

180
00:12:16.721 --> 00:12:21.430
the Boron and a little bit of the hydrogens as well,
right?

181
00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:25.750
And now we're going to lower electron density 0.05 and now there's an

182
00:12:25.751 --> 00:12:29.200
interesting feature you can see here.
You see that dimple?

183
00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:32.020
Why is that?

184
00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:37.930
Why is there not as much electron density at this level around the Boron?

185
00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:43.090
We're out in the valence shell now,
not one s anymore,
right?

186
00:12:43.091 --> 00:12:45.490
Cause the one s is really down close high density.

187
00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:53.220
It's because the hydrogen atoms are pulling the electron density away from the

188
00:12:53.621 --> 00:12:55.210
Valence Adams of Boron.

189
00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:58.660
Often you talk about this in terms of electronegativity,

190
00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:01.540
but why is something electronegative?

191
00:13:01.541 --> 00:13:04.630
It's because of what the effective nuclear charge is.

192
00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:09.760
The effective nuclear charge of hydrogen for the valence level is one,

193
00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:14.290
right?
But for Boron it should be higher.
Boron is,

194
00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:19.080
is the fifth element,
but it's got the,
uh,
the,

195
00:13:19.081 --> 00:13:23.320
the one s electrons shielding the nucleus,
so it's not as,

196
00:13:23.321 --> 00:13:26.500
as high in effective nuclear charges.
Hydrogen does.

197
00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:31.000
So when you put the orbitals together,
hydrogen is lower than Boron,

198
00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:36.100
and the electrons in those bonds are mostly on the hydrogen.

199
00:13:36.730 --> 00:13:39.970
So you'll see that dimple in the middle because there's not much valence

200
00:13:39.971 --> 00:13:42.220
electron density on the Boron.

201
00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:48.300
Now we go to 0.02 electrons per cubic construct and finally to point double o

202
00:13:49.001 --> 00:13:51.240
two electrons per cubic drum,

203
00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:56.430
which is defined as for purposes of drawing what the Vander walls surfaces.

204
00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:02.530
That is how close molecules tend to get to one another at normal pressure in a

205
00:14:02.531 --> 00:14:05.410
liquid or in a crystal.
Right?
And that's,

206
00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:09.690
it's just found empirically just by testing and measuring things that,

207
00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:14.710
that if you draw a surface at 0.02 electrons per cubic construct you have about

208
00:14:15.491 --> 00:14:18.970
how close things would come to one another when you bumped these surfaces into

209
00:14:18.971 --> 00:14:23.890
one another.
Okay.
So that's the Vanderwall surface.
That's a definition,
right?

210
00:14:24.010 --> 00:14:24.700
And we did,

211
00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:28.720
we showed once before electrostatic potential where you show that same surface

212
00:14:28.721 --> 00:14:33.640
but color it to show how the electrons are distributed and the protons in the

213
00:14:33.641 --> 00:14:34.211
molecule.

214
00:14:34.211 --> 00:14:38.800
So as so where would a positive charge on the surface be happy where it's

215
00:14:38.801 --> 00:14:41.530
negative,
that's a red.

216
00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:43.840
And where would it be unhappy?

217
00:14:43.841 --> 00:14:48.640
The positive charge because the molecule is positive there.
That's the blue.

218
00:14:48.850 --> 00:14:50.170
So you can see what it is.

219
00:14:50.170 --> 00:14:54.560
It's red where the hydrogens are because they're pulling the electrons and it's

220
00:14:54.561 --> 00:14:59.390
blue where the Boron is cause it's giving up electrons.
Okay,

221
00:14:59.391 --> 00:15:03.360
so there's uh,
there's what the uh,
what the,

222
00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:06.080
the real molecule looks like.
Of course,

223
00:15:06.081 --> 00:15:09.710
I didn't do it by an experimental measurement for BH three because you can't

224
00:15:09.711 --> 00:15:13.130
crystallize BH three.
I did it by computer calculation,

225
00:15:13.131 --> 00:15:15.440
but I believe that that what it gives us,

226
00:15:15.441 --> 00:15:19.760
what you would see in an experiment if you could do the experiment.
Okay,

227
00:15:19.761 --> 00:15:21.530
so that's the total electron density.

228
00:15:21.531 --> 00:15:26.240
Now let's look at how the computer breaks that up into molecular orbitals and a

229
00:15:26.241 --> 00:15:28.910
calculation like this,
so it looks at,

230
00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:33.620
it makes symmetrical molecular orbitals like Claude,
the things with nodes,

231
00:15:33.621 --> 00:15:37.070
we've seen lots of those.
So here's this framework,

232
00:15:37.071 --> 00:15:39.500
Bh h three and we're going to look at the molecular orbitals,

233
00:15:39.501 --> 00:15:43.610
the computer calculates,
and we're going to make those electron,

234
00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:48.650
those molecular orbitals by adding up atomic orbitals linear combination of

235
00:15:48.651 --> 00:15:51.310
atomic orbitals and which atomic orbitals.

236
00:15:51.310 --> 00:15:56.150
Where will we use in the best would be if we used every atomic orbital,

237
00:15:56.151 --> 00:15:59.930
then we could get perfect flexibility,
but the calculation would take too long.

238
00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:03.380
So we use just a minimal number of atomic orbitals,

239
00:16:03.381 --> 00:16:08.381
namely the the one s orbital on Boron and also the valence orbitals two s two

240
00:16:09.331 --> 00:16:14.330
Px,
two p y to be z,
and also the one s or orbitals of hydrogen.

241
00:16:14.331 --> 00:16:18.110
So there are one,
two,
three,
four,
five,
six,
seven,
eight.

242
00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:23.340
There are eight atomic orbitals we're going to use to make up our molecular

243
00:16:23.361 --> 00:16:27.650
orbitals.
How many independent molecular orbitals can we make?

244
00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:30.020
If we start with eight atomic orbitals,

245
00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:34.970
we could make a molecular orbitals the same number you started with.

246
00:16:34.971 --> 00:16:38.810
If you tried to make more,
they wouldn't be independent of one another,

247
00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:41.480
but you can make from eight you make eight.
Okay?

248
00:16:41.481 --> 00:16:43.100
So these are going to be the energy's.

249
00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:46.880
It'll turn out of the eight molecular orbitals that we're going to get,

250
00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:49.940
that the computer is going to get started from that.

251
00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:55.210
If you added more atomic orbitals v allowed to use three s three p three d and

252
00:16:55.281 --> 00:16:57.980
so on,
then you'd get more molecular orbitals,

253
00:16:58.130 --> 00:17:03.080
but they'd be higher in energy and less relevant.
Okay?
In fact,

254
00:17:03.081 --> 00:17:04.730
how many of these are relevant?

255
00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:11.240
How do we know how many we care about
the energy of

256
00:17:13.070 --> 00:17:17.900
Russel?
How many electrons?
We can put two electrons into each.

257
00:17:18.050 --> 00:17:19.220
Once we've got it filled up,

258
00:17:19.221 --> 00:17:21.890
we don't really care what the other energies there could be,

259
00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:25.430
at least not for this purpose.
Okay,
well,

260
00:17:25.431 --> 00:17:30.230
it turns out that Boron has five electrons.
Hydrogen has three,

261
00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:31.340
eight altogether.

262
00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:35.300
So there'll be eight electrons for pairs,

263
00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:40.160
and that means for occupied orbitals.
We don't care so much about the others,

264
00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:44.480
right?
So those are the occupied molecular orbitals Omo.

265
00:17:45.530 --> 00:17:50.040
Okay.
And then there'll be,
uh,
uh,
also from this set of atomic orbitals,

266
00:17:50.041 --> 00:17:53.460
there'll be four unoccupied molecular orbitals you mos.

267
00:17:55.440 --> 00:18:00.270
Okay.
Now those two are called,
nobody talks about Omo and Omo,

268
00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:04.320
but they talk about homo.
That's very important.
And we'll be talking about that.

269
00:18:04.321 --> 00:18:07.740
That's the highest occupied molecular orbital.

270
00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:13.190
And also they're very interested in the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital.

271
00:18:13.321 --> 00:18:17.880
And you'll see why very shortly.
So the Lumo and the homo are very important.

272
00:18:17.881 --> 00:18:18.900
In this particular case,

273
00:18:18.901 --> 00:18:22.740
it turns out they're two homos that have the same energy,
not surprisingly,

274
00:18:22.741 --> 00:18:26.580
because it's such a symmetrical molecule.
Okay.
Now,

275
00:18:26.581 --> 00:18:29.280
what do you think the very lowest orbital looks like,

276
00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:34.770
Caitlin?
You're our expert
one.

277
00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:38.130
It's the one s orbital of,
of a boron.

278
00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:41.370
So there it is no surprise there.

279
00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:47.490
Not to diminish your contribution,
but it's not surprising.
Okay?

280
00:18:47.491 --> 00:18:50.910
So there's one s that's the boron core.
Now what's gonna come next,
do you think?

281
00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:54.270
After we've got the one s molecular orbital,

282
00:18:54.271 --> 00:18:57.060
what will be next to us?

283
00:18:57.061 --> 00:19:01.320
But it's a molecular orbital be made up of everything.
So here it is,
right?

284
00:19:01.321 --> 00:19:01.680
And it's,

285
00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:06.360
it's all the hydrogens and also the Boron to Sr contributed to that.

286
00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:11.370
Again,
there's a dimple in the middle,
more of the hydrogens than of the Boron.

287
00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:12.233
Why?

288
00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:17.420
Because the hydrogen one s is lower than the Boron two s that the boron one s

289
00:19:19.201 --> 00:19:22.110
was lower.
That's was the first one,
right?
Okay.

290
00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:26.970
And then so there's that radial node,
right?
The spherical sorta node down there,

291
00:19:26.971 --> 00:19:30.660
middle showing,
it's a two S,
right?
And then there's two px,

292
00:19:31.650 --> 00:19:36.120
molecular orbital and a two p.
Why molecular orbital?
And that's four.

293
00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:39.000
And that's all eight electrons.
So that's what we care about.

294
00:19:39.390 --> 00:19:42.090
They're the occupied molecular orbitals of Bh three.

295
00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:44.220
Now how about the vacant orbitals?

296
00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:48.060
The lowest on occupied orbital is that the last two p,

297
00:19:48.061 --> 00:19:51.450
the two PC that's pointed in and out of the plane of the molecule.

298
00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:54.150
And then we're going to have three s,

299
00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:59.280
which you see has that node in the middle too.
So to Sperry sort of nodes

300
00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:05.430
and then a d squared,
d x squared minus y squared.

301
00:20:05.431 --> 00:20:08.190
And finally DXY right?

302
00:20:08.191 --> 00:20:11.910
So that's the molecular orbitals that the computer generates for this thing

303
00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:15.510
using what's called a minimal basis set.

304
00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:19.570
That is the lowest number of orbitals you can use,
uh,

305
00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:23.610
to get through that is through the valence level.

306
00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:27.240
You don't put the higher ones in.
Okay.

307
00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:29.940
Now that's how the computer does it,
right?

308
00:20:29.941 --> 00:20:32.100
And you can get good numbers out of the computer,

309
00:20:32.101 --> 00:20:36.630
like the energy of the molecule or the shape of the molecule where the nuclei

310
00:20:36.631 --> 00:20:39.750
would like to be to minimize the energy.
That's fine.

311
00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:42.510
But for understanding it's not so good.

312
00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:47.810
What we want to do as chemist understand that is to partition the electron

313
00:20:47.981 --> 00:20:48.461
density,

314
00:20:48.461 --> 00:20:53.440
not into these molecular orbitals but into atom pair bonds.

315
00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:57.970
Right?
And anti bonds as you'll see.
And Lone pairs,

316
00:20:58.150 --> 00:21:00.070
the same stuff Louis talked about.

317
00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:05.740
Okay,
that is,
we usually do this,

318
00:21:06.130 --> 00:21:10.630
but sometimes it doesn't work and when doesn't it work?

319
00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:12.190
When it doesn't work,

320
00:21:12.191 --> 00:21:16.960
we must use more sophisticated orbitals where we say there is a certain

321
00:21:16.961 --> 00:21:18.430
phenomenon going on.

322
00:21:18.730 --> 00:21:23.730
You know what that phenomenon is when we can't use localized bonds.

323
00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:31.710
That's what residents is.
When this approach doesn't work.
Hey,

324
00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:36.580
remember that's where Lewis theory had to get sort of complicated baroque.

325
00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:42.250
Okay,
so there's that too.
Pz orbital,
a vacant orbital,

326
00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:47.350
right?
Here's the boron core,
but now we're doing it.

327
00:21:47.410 --> 00:21:52.150
We're happy to use a vacant orbital.
That's part of Lewis's idea.
So to Peezy,

328
00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:56.830
we'll share with the computer.
Both of us see that as a lowest vacant orbital.

329
00:21:57.190 --> 00:22:00.220
The Boron core,
we understand quite well.
Okay,

330
00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:03.940
but how are we going to treat those other three pairs of electrons in the

331
00:22:03.941 --> 00:22:05.500
picture?
Louis would draw.

332
00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:09.040
Where would Lewis put those three pairs of dots?

333
00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:12.400
Angela can't hear.

334
00:22:14.290 --> 00:22:18.490
Those would be the bonds between Bnh.
Okay,

335
00:22:18.730 --> 00:22:22.600
so what will those look like in our crummy picture?
Right?

336
00:22:22.601 --> 00:22:23.770
We're not as good,

337
00:22:23.771 --> 00:22:26.650
at least I'm not as good as the computer at drawing these things,

338
00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:30.970
but what I'd say,
it's going to be an orbital that's big on hydrogen,

339
00:22:31.450 --> 00:22:34.540
smaller on Boron,
some hybrid sp squared.

340
00:22:34.541 --> 00:22:38.020
Hybrid of Boron is going to overlap with h on height with the,

341
00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:39.730
with the one s orbital of hydrogen.

342
00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.850
It's going to be bigger on hydrogen and on Boron.
Why?

343
00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:46.600
Why should the lowest?
The bonding over,

344
00:22:46.601 --> 00:22:50.700
it'll be bigger on hydrogen than oxymoron.
Lucas,

345
00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:54.770
uh,
one is,
yeah,

346
00:22:54.910 --> 00:22:58.480
that's another way that's,
it's that that orbital,

347
00:22:58.481 --> 00:23:02.740
the hydrogen Orville is lower than in lower in energy than the bore on it's

348
00:23:02.741 --> 00:23:07.450
mixing with,
right?
So it's uneven mixing,
right?
Poor energy match.

349
00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:10.870
So the one that went down looks mostly like the hydrogen,

350
00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:15.490
the one that went up looks mostly like the Boron.
So we see one,
in fact,

351
00:23:15.491 --> 00:23:19.060
we see three of these one point in toward each hydrogen,
right?

352
00:23:19.061 --> 00:23:20.800
And they all have this from our point of view,

353
00:23:20.801 --> 00:23:25.801
they all have the same energy where they're all BH bonds shown as their energy

354
00:23:26.021 --> 00:23:27.700
and red there.
Okay.

355
00:23:28.330 --> 00:23:33.330
But notice you get the same total energy as the computer with the computer

356
00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:38.440
divides the pie completely differently.
Right?

357
00:23:39.010 --> 00:23:42.610
But you get the same answer,
right?

358
00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:47.120
And the same geometry that the computer from the point of view of what direction

359
00:23:47.121 --> 00:23:50.600
to the hybrids point and so on.
So we're getting the same structure,

360
00:23:50.601 --> 00:23:55.190
we're getting the same energy.
You get the same total electron density too.

361
00:23:56.420 --> 00:23:58.490
If you add all the electrons together,

362
00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:01.940
three bonds add together to give the team the same way.

363
00:24:01.941 --> 00:24:06.680
Remember three P orbitals added up to give a sphere,
right?
Are Three,

364
00:24:06.930 --> 00:24:11.390
uh,
bonds add up to give the same energy as the computer.

365
00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:13.820
So who needs a computer,
right?

366
00:24:13.821 --> 00:24:18.350
Our bonds work just as well if we view them right.
Okay.

367
00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:20.750
And then there would be the antibody,

368
00:24:20.810 --> 00:24:25.310
the one that's what's left over that's big on age,
big on Boron,

369
00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:30.110
small on h and a node between hydrogen and Boron.

370
00:24:30.111 --> 00:24:34.100
It's anti-bonding the one that went up and energy when the Adams came together.

371
00:24:34.490 --> 00:24:39.070
And again,
there'd be three of these sigma stars big on h big on Boron,

372
00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:42.860
small on age.
They would all have the same energy.
But again,
they're,

373
00:24:42.890 --> 00:24:47.210
they're average energy is the same as the average energy of unoccupied molecular

374
00:24:47.211 --> 00:24:49.790
orbitals that,
that the computer gets.

375
00:24:50.030 --> 00:24:54.740
So we're not doing so bad following Louis in this respect,
looking at the,

376
00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:59.480
at the electron density in terms of bonds rather than in terms of molecular

377
00:24:59.481 --> 00:25:03.320
orbitals.
Okay.
So for many purposes,

378
00:25:03.321 --> 00:25:06.260
localized bond orbitals are not bad.

379
00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:09.710
And there are certainly a heck of a lot easier to think about.
Uh,

380
00:25:10.390 --> 00:25:15.380
but beware of resonance,
right?
It's cause sometimes this isn't gonna work,

381
00:25:15.381 --> 00:25:19.040
so we'll have to understand how that works.
So the localized bond,

382
00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:20.150
orbital picture,

383
00:25:20.450 --> 00:25:24.290
pairwise molecular orbitals that is to Adam's coming together to overlap.

384
00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:29.210
And also there'll be isolated at atomic orbitals like unshared payers or

385
00:25:29.211 --> 00:25:32.150
isolated vacant orbitals like the Pz orbital,

386
00:25:32.151 --> 00:25:34.970
a boron that we just saw that will be,

387
00:25:34.971 --> 00:25:38.960
this picture will be our intermediate between hydrogen,

388
00:25:38.961 --> 00:25:41.690
like atomic orbitals,
which we really understand.

389
00:25:41.691 --> 00:25:44.210
You just look up in the table and you got them right.

390
00:25:44.450 --> 00:25:46.330
And computer molecular orbitals,

391
00:25:46.331 --> 00:25:50.510
which are too complicated really to understand in any kind of detail.

392
00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:52.450
It's handy to,

393
00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:55.970
sometimes for some purposes it's very handy to be able to calculate them and

394
00:25:55.971 --> 00:25:59.480
look at them.
Right?
But you don't do it very often in your head.

395
00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:04.370
So when West me think more deeply when the mixing,

396
00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:09.400
when you have these localized orbitals but they mix to cause reactivity,

397
00:26:10.611 --> 00:26:15.170
that is a molecular orbital from this molecule mixes with a molecular orbital

398
00:26:15.171 --> 00:26:18.650
from this molecule and one goes down in one goes up.

399
00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:20.840
That's what our reaction is.

400
00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:26.950
Or when you have to pairwise orbitals in the same molecule,

401
00:26:28.550 --> 00:26:31.880
right?
That we thought of as bonds are vacant orbitals or something like that.

402
00:26:32.210 --> 00:26:36.140
And those interact with one another within the same molecule.

403
00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:40.310
We were too simplistic and thinking of them as independent,

404
00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:44.040
they interact with one another.
That's what resonance,

405
00:26:44.490 --> 00:26:49.080
that's when resonance occurs is when you have important interactions within a

406
00:26:49.081 --> 00:26:53.670
molecule between orbitals are what between what you thought or orbitals.

407
00:26:54.150 --> 00:26:58.950
But we're thinking to simply,
so where are we?
We've gone through Adam's,

408
00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:03.810
we've gone through molecules and looked at how we can understand the electron

409
00:27:03.811 --> 00:27:07.230
density and molecules and now we're to the final payoff,

410
00:27:07.470 --> 00:27:08.850
which is reactivity.

411
00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:14.060
How can we understand reactivity in terms of SOMOS singly occupied,

412
00:27:14.821 --> 00:27:18.570
molecular orbitals,
hi,
homos and low lumos.

413
00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:22.200
And then how can we recognize functional groups?

414
00:27:22.230 --> 00:27:24.090
So even though if he never saw them before,

415
00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:25.800
we know what they're going to be react,

416
00:27:25.801 --> 00:27:30.780
how reactive they are going to be and what with,
that's the payoff.
Okay.

417
00:27:30.781 --> 00:27:34.050
So now we know that if you have two molecules and you're interested in,

418
00:27:34.051 --> 00:27:35.870
they're reacting,
uh,

419
00:27:35.910 --> 00:27:40.530
there'll be molecular orbitals of the two that come together,
interact.
And the,

420
00:27:40.531 --> 00:27:44.310
if the molecule gets the,
if the energy goes down because of that,

421
00:27:44.550 --> 00:27:47.730
that'll be a favorable reaction.
If the energy goes up,

422
00:27:47.790 --> 00:27:52.680
they'll bounce off one another.
Okay,
so,
but they're there.

423
00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:55.530
How many molecular orbitals are there on a molecule?

424
00:27:59.850 --> 00:28:04.470
Suppose method,
how many molecular orbitals does it have to?

425
00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:09.150
It has an infinite number,
right?
The 13 z orbital and so on.

426
00:28:10.110 --> 00:28:12.510
Okay.
So it's going to be,

427
00:28:12.570 --> 00:28:16.680
we have to pick out which orbitals are going to be important in interacting with

428
00:28:16.681 --> 00:28:20.520
one another or else we're just going to be at a loss because there'll be so
many,

429
00:28:20.850 --> 00:28:24.840
I mean,
so,
so you have these orbitals on molecule B say,

430
00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:29.940
and those are occupied and the ones above are vacant,

431
00:28:30.390 --> 00:28:32.970
unoccupied.
And on molecule a,

432
00:28:32.971 --> 00:28:37.170
you have a bunch of occupied and a bunch of unoccupied molecular orbitals.

433
00:28:37.410 --> 00:28:42.210
And now we're going to look at orbitals of be interim mixing with orbitals of a

434
00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:47.670
right.
And which ones we might look at those two interacting for example,

435
00:28:47.671 --> 00:28:49.890
mix those two with between a and B.

436
00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:52.920
Or we could mix those two or those two or those two or those two or those two of

437
00:28:52.921 --> 00:28:55.500
those students,
those two,
those are those do those over those two,
those two,

438
00:28:55.501 --> 00:29:00.240
those two,
those two,
those two.
And it goes up infinitely.
So this is a problem.

439
00:29:01.650 --> 00:29:05.460
Even if we understand how orbitals interact with one another,

440
00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:10.230
we're going to have to narrow our focus if we want to deal with this.
Okay.

441
00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:14.610
So let's look at,
so there are myriad possible pairwise mixings.

442
00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:18.870
Now there's one that's going to be obviously important.

443
00:29:19.230 --> 00:29:24.230
Suppose that molecule B has an odd number of electrons and therefore a singly

444
00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:29.070
occupied molecular orbital.
And the same is true of molecule a.

445
00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:33.600
Just suppose that happens,
right?
Then,
uh,

446
00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:39.140
then when they come together and mix those two electrons will both go down in

447
00:29:39.481 --> 00:29:43.690
energy.
So that's bound to be favorable,

448
00:29:45.610 --> 00:29:49.120
substantially favorable,
and they'll get a new bond.

449
00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:53.200
That's like two hydrogen atoms come together.
So if there are,

450
00:29:53.201 --> 00:29:58.201
so Moe's on the two molecules and notice suppose be had of Somo but a didn't.

451
00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:04.660
Right?
But you're not just talking about two molecules,

452
00:30:04.661 --> 00:30:07.840
you're talking about two flasks.
If you mix it,

453
00:30:07.930 --> 00:30:12.340
you had to have two bs that both had so most.

454
00:30:12.341 --> 00:30:17.290
So a could be another B.
So if you have any SOMOS,
right,

455
00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:21.100
that you can pair them be with B if he doesn't have any.
Right.

456
00:30:21.550 --> 00:30:24.610
So if they exist,
if there's a somo then,

457
00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:28.570
and that's true of many atoms or things called free radicals,

458
00:30:28.571 --> 00:30:32.920
like the hydrogen atom,
the chlorine atom,
the methyl radical,
right,

459
00:30:33.130 --> 00:30:37.000
then they're going to be very reactive.
Okay.

460
00:30:37.270 --> 00:30:40.240
And for that very reason,
they're not very common.

461
00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:44.860
You can't buy a bottle of methyl radicals because they will all have reacted

462
00:30:44.861 --> 00:30:48.400
with one another.
The same for hydrogen atoms,
the same for chlorine atoms.

463
00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:52.900
So that's an easy case to understand when you have SOMOS,

464
00:30:53.230 --> 00:30:58.230
but it's very rare to encounter it unless you're talking about flames were lots

465
00:30:58.961 --> 00:31:02.290
of things are atoms and free radicals as they're called.

466
00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:06.340
We'll talk about that a lot more at the end of the semester.
Okay.

467
00:31:06.341 --> 00:31:10.660
Now how about there too?
That could mix.
It's not bad energy match.
Right?

468
00:31:10.661 --> 00:31:14.590
And suppose they have good overlap or do you care about that one?

469
00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:19.940
Why Not Lucas?
Oh,
it exists.
It's an orbital.

470
00:31:20.330 --> 00:31:24.610
There no electrons to have that energy.
It's a,
it's an available energy,

471
00:31:24.790 --> 00:31:29.080
but nobody availed themselves of it so it doesn't contribute anything.

472
00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:31.780
Right.
So that's,
there's nothing there.

473
00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:35.160
So forget that one and you can forget a whole button.

474
00:31:35.170 --> 00:31:39.940
You can free up most of them for this reason.
Right?
Of the infinite number.
Okay.

475
00:31:39.941 --> 00:31:42.520
Now how about this pair?
Now they do,

476
00:31:42.550 --> 00:31:45.100
they have let's suppose to have good overlap.

477
00:31:45.910 --> 00:31:48.790
They're not bad energy match.
Right?

478
00:31:48.791 --> 00:31:52.240
So two electrons will go down and two will go up.
Do you care

479
00:31:53.890 --> 00:31:54.723
Stephen,

480
00:31:56.790 --> 00:31:58.180
<v 1>since those two?</v>

481
00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:01.990
Yeah.

482
00:32:01.990 --> 00:32:04.810
<v 0>So they more or less cancel.
Do they exactly cancel</v>

483
00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:06.273
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

484
00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:08.550
<v 0>in which direction did they not canceled?
Corey</v>

485
00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:11.610
<v 1>I love lower one is</v>

486
00:32:13.730 --> 00:32:14.563
even worse.

487
00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:16.650
<v 0>The lower one is bonding but bigger.</v>

488
00:32:16.651 --> 00:32:19.710
By bigger you mean greater than one over the square root of two kinds of things.

489
00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:23.970
So,
so our adult,
pardon me,
less than one over the square root of two is smaller.

490
00:32:24.180 --> 00:32:25.680
That's what you should have said.
Okay.

491
00:32:25.681 --> 00:32:29.910
It's smaller so it doesn't go down as much as the upper one goes up.

492
00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:34.740
So pretty much they cancel.
But to the extent they don't cancel,

493
00:32:34.741 --> 00:32:37.050
it's repulsive.
It's heart bad to come together,

494
00:32:37.170 --> 00:32:40.160
which means the molecules will bounce off,
right?

495
00:32:40.161 --> 00:32:42.410
So when you have filled orbitals hitting one another,

496
00:32:42.650 --> 00:32:47.480
the molecules repel one another.
Okay?
So,
uh,

497
00:32:47.510 --> 00:32:51.410
that's weak net repulsion.
That's not going to explain a reaction.

498
00:32:53.030 --> 00:32:56.960
Uh,
now how about here?
Now we're mixing a filled or,

499
00:32:56.961 --> 00:33:00.350
but with a vacant orbital,
so two electrons go down.

500
00:33:00.351 --> 00:33:04.550
So you don't have this canceling.
Is this going to be important?
This one,
Josh.

501
00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:06.631
Oh,

502
00:33:06.631 --> 00:33:11.270
the energy matches so bad that you don't get very much going down.

503
00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:15.770
Not enough to make up for the fact that there,
if they'll come together,

504
00:33:15.771 --> 00:33:19.610
they're going to be a lot of other orbitals molecular orbitals overlapping and

505
00:33:19.611 --> 00:33:22.040
they're going to be repulsive.
The kinder we just looked at.

506
00:33:22.041 --> 00:33:26.870
So this week attraction,
it's not going to be worth much.
Okay.

507
00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:31.850
How about,
so it's negligible mixing because of bad energy match.
Now,

508
00:33:31.910 --> 00:33:36.230
how about here?
Now that's not bad energy match.
I mean,

509
00:33:36.231 --> 00:33:38.000
it's not great energy match,

510
00:33:38.450 --> 00:33:42.260
but it's certainly better than any other pair of occupied with vacant.

511
00:33:43.010 --> 00:33:47.840
Okay?
So that means though that pair,
we'll go down,
right?

512
00:33:48.050 --> 00:33:53.050
And you'll get bonding if the energy matches good enough that the amount that he

513
00:33:53.931 --> 00:33:55.190
go down is significant.

514
00:33:56.830 --> 00:33:57.663
<v 2>Okay?</v>

515
00:33:57.870 --> 00:33:59.640
<v 0>So remember when we tried the same thing,</v>

516
00:33:59.641 --> 00:34:04.020
the other direction from the highest one on the right to the lowest one on the

517
00:34:04.021 --> 00:34:07.710
left,
the energy match was not good.
So that didn't help.

518
00:34:08.070 --> 00:34:10.980
But this one where it's high on the left and low on the right,

519
00:34:11.160 --> 00:34:13.680
that one will help.
Okay?

520
00:34:13.950 --> 00:34:18.950
So what it requires to have a reaction is that you have a high homo and

521
00:34:22.621 --> 00:34:27.621
unusually high homo on one molecule and an unusually low Lumo on the other so

522
00:34:29.941 --> 00:34:34.890
that you have good energy match,
or at least as good as you can get,
right?

523
00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:36.450
Then you could get a reaction.

524
00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:41.840
And it turns out that they're simple names for things that have unusually high

525
00:34:42.241 --> 00:34:46.140
homos and things that have unusually low lumos.

526
00:34:46.620 --> 00:34:48.030
And you know what those names are

527
00:34:51.810 --> 00:34:56.810
something that has an unusually high homo is called a base and something that

528
00:34:58.891 --> 00:35:01.980
has an unusually low Lumo is called

529
00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:04.753
and acid,

530
00:35:07.070 --> 00:35:07.620
<v 2>right?</v>

531
00:35:07.620 --> 00:35:11.490
<v 0>So that's a generalization of the idea of acid and base.</v>

532
00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:17.240
Most mixing of Mos affects neither the overall energy nor the overall electron

533
00:35:18.811 --> 00:35:22.980
distribution for one or more of these reasons.
Okay.

534
00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:27.570
First the electron occupancy can be for that is both were occupied,

535
00:35:27.571 --> 00:35:29.280
which means to go up and to go down.

536
00:35:29.281 --> 00:35:30.690
And the ones that go up and go up a little more.

537
00:35:30.691 --> 00:35:35.691
So that's not a bond or zero and you don't care about the energy or the energy

538
00:35:36.121 --> 00:35:37.230
matches poor.

539
00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:42.480
So there's not much mixing all together or there's poor overlap.

540
00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:46.680
So even if the energy match,
we're good,
you wouldn't get anything out of it.

541
00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:52.700
But if you have high homo and low Lumo mixing,

542
00:35:53.850 --> 00:35:58.850
then you get reactivity unusually high homo and unusually low Lumo.

543
00:35:59.250 --> 00:36:02.610
And that's the secret we've been going for all semester.

544
00:36:04.050 --> 00:36:09.050
So here's increasing generality in the concept of acid and base.

545
00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:13.240
The idea of the names were introduced,
uh,
by,
uh,

546
00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:18.000
lavoie ca in 1789 and we'll talk about that.
And from his point of view,

547
00:36:18.001 --> 00:36:23.001
and acid was a base was an element of substance that could be oxidized and an

548
00:36:23.641 --> 00:36:25.950
acid.
It was something that had been oxidized.

549
00:36:26.070 --> 00:36:30.600
Like sulfur was a base oxidized sulfur.

550
00:36:30.601 --> 00:36:34.950
Sulfuric acid was an acid.
Phosphorus was a base oxidized foster.

551
00:36:34.951 --> 00:36:37.890
So as phosphoric acid,
carbon was a base.

552
00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:41.220
Oxidized carbon was carbonic acid.
Okay.

553
00:36:41.730 --> 00:36:45.720
Then in a hundred years later,
Arrhenius in Sweden,
uh,

554
00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:49.890
said that an acid was something that was,
had the idea that there were ions,

555
00:36:49.950 --> 00:36:54.950
things that were charged and that a thing that would give h plus was an acid and

556
00:36:55.711 --> 00:37:00.330
a thing that would give ooh minus was a base.
That's the radius as theory.

557
00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:05.060
And that was further generalized in 1923 by Runstead and Lowery.

558
00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:09.930
Uh,
Runstead was a Dane and Lowery,
an Englishman who said that,

559
00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:13.470
that an acid was not,
was an h plus donor.

560
00:37:13.620 --> 00:37:15.060
That's the same as the radius.

561
00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:19.990
But the base was something that it could accept h plus not only ooh minus,

562
00:37:20.010 --> 00:37:23.210
but ammonia for example,
could accept,
uh,

563
00:37:24.210 --> 00:37:25.200
could accept a base.

564
00:37:25.201 --> 00:37:30.201
And Lewis then in the same year had the idea that an acid was something that

565
00:37:30.211 --> 00:37:32.160
could accept an electron pair,

566
00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:37.550
like Bh three and a base was something that could donate an electron pair like

567
00:37:40.170 --> 00:37:41.760
ammonia.
Right?

568
00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:45.810
And the other names for those acceptors and donors are electro file,

569
00:37:45.811 --> 00:37:49.740
something that loves electrons,
will accept them at a nucleophile,

570
00:37:49.741 --> 00:37:53.400
something that loves the nucleus is something that will give electrons to it.

571
00:37:54.570 --> 00:37:59.250
But in the 1960s this was generalized finally to where it is now,

572
00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:04.640
that that an unusually low vacant orbital is something that can accept

573
00:38:06.331 --> 00:38:11.100
electrons,
electrons like to be in a low energy orbital.

574
00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:14.970
So that is the ultimate definition of what an acid is.

575
00:38:15.270 --> 00:38:16.530
And by the same token,

576
00:38:16.770 --> 00:38:21.770
an unusually high homo has electrons that are eager to avail themselves of some

577
00:38:22.561 --> 00:38:27.000
vacant orbital to lower their energy.
And that is a base.

578
00:38:27.450 --> 00:38:32.040
Okay.
So as so often in science,
as the science matures,

579
00:38:32.250 --> 00:38:37.250
you get more and more generality to the idea and homo and Lumo unusually high

580
00:38:37.601 --> 00:38:41.320
Hobo,
unusually low Lumo are the,
uh,

581
00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:45.070
the ultimate form of acid base.
And that's what we'll be talking about.

582
00:38:45.071 --> 00:38:46.570
But they have to be unusual.

583
00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:49.600
Why do they have to be unusually high and unusually low?

584
00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:56.380
Otherwise you don't have good energy match to change the electron energies when

585
00:38:56.381 --> 00:38:59.470
they come together.
Okay,

586
00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:04.720
now here's what you should have asked.
Unusual compared to what,

587
00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:10.690
okay,
so here is what we're organic chemists.

588
00:39:10.780 --> 00:39:14.980
If we were some other kinds of chemists in some other universe dealing with

589
00:39:14.981 --> 00:39:18.250
different elements,
we'd have different points of comparison.

590
00:39:18.580 --> 00:39:22.390
But what we deal with is things that have a lot of carbon and hydrogen in them.

591
00:39:22.391 --> 00:39:25.870
And by far,
our most common bonds are among,

592
00:39:25.930 --> 00:39:28.390
between carbons are between carbon and hydrogen.

593
00:39:29.140 --> 00:39:33.010
So it turns out that the valence orbitals of carbon,

594
00:39:33.011 --> 00:39:35.020
the SP hybrid orbitals of carbon,

595
00:39:35.410 --> 00:39:40.000
and that one s orbital of hydrogen are roughly the same in energy.

596
00:39:41.110 --> 00:39:44.290
For our purposes,
we'll consider them to be the same.
Okay,

597
00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:46.120
so you bring two of these together.

598
00:39:46.121 --> 00:39:50.170
They overlap and you get sigma and Sigma Star,

599
00:39:50.230 --> 00:39:53.410
and we've talked about that,
the bonding and the anti-bonding orbital.

600
00:39:53.620 --> 00:39:58.620
So most of the occupied orbitals we're dealing with our cc sigma or c h sigma,

601
00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:06.270
and most of the anti-bonding are orbitals are sigma star ch or sigma star Cc.

602
00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:10.030
So those are our point of comparison.

603
00:40:10.031 --> 00:40:14.080
Those are the plain vanilla electrons and holes.

604
00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:15.993
Okay,

605
00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:20.830
now let's look at other things and see whether they're unusual with respect to

606
00:40:20.831 --> 00:40:21.664
this.

607
00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:25.870
Now there will be several classes that they fall into,

608
00:40:26.830 --> 00:40:27.131
right?

609
00:40:27.131 --> 00:40:32.131
So those are the usual Lumo and the usual homo and or the CC analogs.

610
00:40:34.750 --> 00:40:36.610
Now,
what could make things weird?

611
00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:40.750
One thing can make things weird is that if you had valence,

612
00:40:40.751 --> 00:40:44.650
shell atomic orbitals that didn't get mixed with anything.

613
00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:48.430
So they're not sigma or Sigma Star bonding or antibiotic,

614
00:40:48.670 --> 00:40:53.530
they're the original orbital in between these.
So that would make things unusual.

615
00:40:54.100 --> 00:40:57.880
A second one would be a little bit in between these two when the,

616
00:40:58.060 --> 00:41:01.600
if there's no overlap,
then you have unmixed orbitals.

617
00:41:01.810 --> 00:41:06.700
If there's a lot of overlap,
you get bonds.
But there could be poor overlap,

618
00:41:07.060 --> 00:41:11.040
in which case you don't go down as far with your bonding orbital or up as far

619
00:41:11.230 --> 00:41:15.250
with your antibiotic overdose.
So a second case would be poor overlap.

620
00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:20.760
A third case would be that the actual atomic energy that the atomic orbital

621
00:41:21.011 --> 00:41:25.690
energy that you're using the Adam you're using is not like carbon and hydrogen.

622
00:41:25.691 --> 00:41:30.691
So it starts at a completely different place from where the standard orbital

623
00:41:31.061 --> 00:41:33.920
start before they make the molecular.

624
00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:38.540
The bonding orbitals and forth could be if there's charge around,

625
00:41:38.810 --> 00:41:40.790
because obviously if you have a negative charge,

626
00:41:40.791 --> 00:41:43.010
it's not such a good place to put electrons.

627
00:41:43.011 --> 00:41:46.790
That means the orbitals are high in energy.
If you have a net positive charge,

628
00:41:46.791 --> 00:41:50.420
it's a good place to put electrons.
It's low in energy,
so charge can make it.

629
00:41:50.420 --> 00:41:55.310
So we're going to show examples of these four contributors that will allow you

630
00:41:55.311 --> 00:42:00.110
to identify when a molecule has an unusual orbital energy,

631
00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:04.430
right?
Unusually High Homo,
unusually low Lumo,

632
00:42:04.431 --> 00:42:07.250
and then you know that it'll be a functional group.

633
00:42:07.790 --> 00:42:11.540
And you also know what the will react with because if you have an unusually high

634
00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:15.350
high homo,
it'll react with an unusually low Lumo and vice versa.

635
00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:21.800
Okay,
so first let's look at the first one.
Uh,
unmixed valence,
shell atomic,

636
00:42:21.801 --> 00:42:26.630
orbitals.
So h plus our radius is acid,
right?

637
00:42:26.870 --> 00:42:31.130
That's,
that's a vacant orbital,
right?

638
00:42:31.131 --> 00:42:34.250
No Electron in it.
So that's obviously unusually low.

639
00:42:34.251 --> 00:42:38.570
It's where this started the one s of hydrogen before it went up or down.

640
00:42:38.870 --> 00:42:42.620
So if you had h plus,
it would be an unusually low vacant orbital.

641
00:42:44.420 --> 00:42:46.910
How about Nh three,
right?

642
00:42:47.060 --> 00:42:50.240
It has an unshared pair only on the nitrogen.

643
00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:55.160
Now it likes being on nitrogen compared to carbon or hydrogen.

644
00:42:55.161 --> 00:42:55.994
Why?

645
00:42:56.060 --> 00:42:58.400
<v 1>What makes it better to be on nitrogen?</v>

646
00:42:58.970 --> 00:43:03.970
Innovalon shell orbital than on the unshared pair than to be on high and

647
00:43:05.241 --> 00:43:07.730
unshared pair on carbon or on hydrogen?
Angela,

648
00:43:09.930 --> 00:43:13.710
<v 0>there's more protons in the nucleus.
It's a lower energy orbital to start with,</v>

649
00:43:14.130 --> 00:43:17.520
right?
So,
but that it didn't mix with anything.

650
00:43:17.521 --> 00:43:20.700
They're Nh bonds in ammonia,
right?

651
00:43:20.910 --> 00:43:25.020
And they've mixed and went way down in energy and a vacant orbital went up in

652
00:43:25.021 --> 00:43:28.560
energy.
But the unshared pair didn't mix with anything,

653
00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:31.260
so it still has that original energy.

654
00:43:31.261 --> 00:43:34.200
So it's unusually high compared to what?

655
00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:36.553
<v 1>Compared to wild</v>

656
00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:41.890
<v 0>CHC or cc sigma.
That's our point of comparison.</v>

657
00:43:42.910 --> 00:43:44.150
Okay.
Or the,

658
00:43:44.330 --> 00:43:49.330
the flip side of that is BH three which has a vacant orbital.

659
00:43:50.260 --> 00:43:54.670
It's high to start with compared with a hydrogen or a carbon because Boron

660
00:43:54.671 --> 00:43:59.200
doesn't have very big nuclear charge.
Right.
And it's,
and it's,

661
00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:03.310
and it's nucleus is screened,
right?
So it's an unusually hot,

662
00:44:03.340 --> 00:44:07.980
it's unusually high for an atom,
but it's still atomic.

663
00:44:07.990 --> 00:44:11.350
It didn't mix with anything and go up further.
Right.

664
00:44:11.590 --> 00:44:16.510
So it's unusually low for a vacant orbital.
So be h three is a low,

665
00:44:16.511 --> 00:44:19.720
unusually low Lumo.
So is it an acid or a base

666
00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:31.560
<v 1>which
you've read through lecture?</v>

667
00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:36.930
<v 0>You don't get the vote.
It's like h plus,
right?</v>

668
00:44:36.931 --> 00:44:41.520
An unusually low Lumo so it's an acid.
How about Nh?

669
00:44:41.521 --> 00:44:46.140
Three.
So base,
unusually high homo.

670
00:44:46.830 --> 00:44:51.370
Okay.
How about water?
Right.
It is unshared.

671
00:44:51.390 --> 00:44:53.470
Pairs of electrons.
You know,
Lucas,

672
00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:58.350
<v 1>can we just say that they both had these properties because they</v>

673
00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:05.150
charge,
we use nitrogen.
That nitrogen has heightened,

674
00:45:05.250 --> 00:45:06.990
which has loaded with nitrogen,

675
00:45:06.991 --> 00:45:10.410
is hot and loans that are charged from pair to carpet.
Yeah,

676
00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:12.420
and VHR is even lower

677
00:45:13.980 --> 00:45:18.980
energies food or is it just because of the [inaudible]?

678
00:45:20.570 --> 00:45:24.770
<v 0>But remember you have to bear in mind which row of the periodic table you're in,</v>

679
00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:28.340
right?
HM,
true.
It only has one proton,

680
00:45:28.341 --> 00:45:33.110
but you're talking a one s orbital low and energy for carbon,
nitrogen,

681
00:45:33.111 --> 00:45:37.850
oxygen,
Boron.
You're talking two S,
right?
So that,

682
00:45:38.030 --> 00:45:40.310
so that you're changing the game.

683
00:45:43.060 --> 00:45:44.750
No,
no.
Not between Bh three days.

684
00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:49.900
H three is unusually high energy for an occupied or orbital.

685
00:45:50.930 --> 00:45:55.310
Bh Three is unusually low,
although it's high compared to nitrogen.

686
00:45:55.311 --> 00:45:56.930
It's low for a vacant orbital.

687
00:45:57.620 --> 00:46:02.240
It's an unusually low Lumo nitrogen,
unusually high homo.
Now,

688
00:46:02.241 --> 00:46:04.850
oxygen is lower than nitrogen,

689
00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:07.370
so water is a base,

690
00:46:07.790 --> 00:46:12.140
but it's not as good as not as good as base as ammonia because its electrons

691
00:46:12.141 --> 00:46:16.070
aren't as high because it has a bigger nuclear charge and the same end,

692
00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:21.230
it's in the first complete row of the periodic table.
Okay,
Ooh.

693
00:46:21.370 --> 00:46:26.330
Minus is even higher.
It's a stronger base than water.
Why?

694
00:46:29.270 --> 00:46:33.500
Why are its electrons higher in energy then water,

695
00:46:36.620 --> 00:46:41.620
not less protons,
right?
It's got,
it's got a net negative large,

696
00:46:41.860 --> 00:46:45.640
which makes all the electrons high in energy,
and specifically the pair.

697
00:46:45.641 --> 00:46:48.070
We care about the highest one unusually I,

698
00:46:48.490 --> 00:46:52.690
because it's got a negative charge website.
Press the wrong button there.
Okay.

699
00:46:52.750 --> 00:46:57.750
Ch three minus is even more of a base because carbon doesn't have as many as

700
00:46:59.621 --> 00:47:03.190
big.
A nuclear charge is oxygen.
So when it has a negative charge,

701
00:47:03.191 --> 00:47:07.870
it's a really high homo.
Okay.
I gotta quit there.

702
00:47:07.900 --> 00:47:10.180
We'll go on to two,
three,
and four next time.
