00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.230
I’m getting older, which would be fine if
it weren’t for the fact that everything

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:06.650
hurts and suddenly I need to nap all the time.

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:12.090
Why body, why?

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.910
Hi everyone, Julian here for DNews.

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.050
You may have heard the myth that the human
body essentially replaces itself every 7 years.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.490
While that’s not strictly correct, I think
I see the kernel of truth at the heart of

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:25.090
this myth: most of your body’s cells replace
themselves over time.

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.050
According to the Science Museum in London
- in the time it takes to say this sentence,

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.920
50 million of my roughly 75 trillion cells
will have died and been replaced.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.229
They do it at different rates though, with
skin cells dying off after two or three weeks

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:39.890
while white blood cells can live for an entire
year.

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:45.890
So if most of you is hitting the refresh button
all the time, why do our bodies still deteriorate?

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.350
Scientists from the Salk Institute and the
Chinese Academy of Sciences think they’re

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.350
onto an answer.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.979
They were looking into the underlying causes
of Werner Syndrome, which causes premature

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:57.920
aging and a whole host of disorders normally
associated with people much older.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.809
About 1 in 20,000 people in the U.S. have
it, and they are prone to early onset of cataracts,

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:04.390
osteoporosis, and some cancers.

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.119
Many of them die in their 40s or early 50s.

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:10.550
Werner syndrome is associated with a mutation
in the WRN gene.

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.140
For most people, the gene codes an enzyme
that keeps DNA structured soundly.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.220
But with the mutation, the WRN protein isn’t
made properly and it affects the way the DNA

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:20.220
bundles itself.

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.280
We’re all familiar with the double helix
shape of DNA, but there’s more to it than

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.280
that.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.350
If you were to stretch out the DNA from just
one cell, it would be about 2 meters long.

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.060
To be able to cram all this into just the
nucleus, DNA is packaged into chromatins.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.970
Euchromatin is looser, it looks like beads
on a string, and this shape makes it easy

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.649
for enzymes to access and code more proteins.

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:44.010
Heterochromatin is more tightly bunched and
folded, which means the genes tucked in there

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:45.010
aren’t being expressed.

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:49.249
That’s why the vast majority of your cells
have nearly identical DNA but they do very

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:51.049
different jobs.

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:54.259
Heterochromatin is folded differently from
one type of cell to another, and the way it’s

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:56.649
bunched determines what genes are switched
off.

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:00.270
This way the cell saves energy and only does
the job it’s specified for.

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.720
The researchers mimicked Werner syndrome by
deleting the WRN gene in healthy stem cells

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.969
and letting the DNA carry on as usual.

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:11.540
Without the WRN protein to interact with the
markers on the heterochromatin called epigenetic

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.150
tags, the scientists found the heterochromatin
started bunching differently and the cells

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.230
aged faster.

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.470
This could be expanded beyond just people
with Werner syndrome: it’s possible the

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.430
heterochromatin shapes change over our lifetimes
after being wound into chromosomes and replicated

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.670
and divided over and over.

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.849
Maybe this is what makes our DNA express itself
differently and causes our slow decline into

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:33.500
brittle old meat sacks.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.760
And if that’s the case, maybe it’s possible
to stop or even reverse the aging process,

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.640
provided we can also solve a few other problems
father time throws at your DNA like your telomeres

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:43.640
shortening.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.540
Telomeres are long tags at the end of chromosomes
that don’t actually code any proteins.

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.819
They give the machinery that copies DNA a
foothold but they get a little shorter with

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:52.819
every replication.

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:56.409
When they’re finally too short, the cell
can’t divide anymore.

00:02:56.409 --> 00:03:00.209
There is an enzyme called a telomerase that
adds to the ends of your chromosomes, but

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:01.910
over your lifetime they can’t keep up.

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.360
There are a couple other factors in aging
too, like oxidative stress, which is when

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.489
free radicals damage DNA; and glycation, which
is when glucose binds to DNA, proteins, or

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:12.329
lipids and gums up the works.

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:16.880
So if we sort out these other issues our DNA
has to cope with as time passes, maybe it’s

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.310
possible for me to be this young and beautiful
forever.

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.420
Ok, at least I’ll be young.

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.400
So what is it that’s responsible for this
mug of mine?

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.850
Turns out it might be junk DNA.

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:40.140
Anthony explains how DNA shaped your face
too in this video.

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.670
Werner syndrome sounds like a seriously raw
deal but maybe with gene therapy one day it’ll

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:45.670
be a thing of the past.

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:48.459
Are there any other bizarre afflictions you’d
