1
00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:06.180
One of the major diseases of mismatch is obesity and obesity.

2
00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:07.440
As we've seen earlier.

3
00:00:07.441 --> 00:00:11.790
When we discussed what is the disease is a disease of homeostasis.

4
00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:18.400
Basically it results from too much food and too little exercise.

5
00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:25.100
It also has to do with food quality with sleep deprivation and the role that

6
00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.480
Ghrelin hormone plays in mediating the effects of sleep deprivation.

7
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.200
There are effects of breastfeeding and of c-sections on the risk of obesity and

8
00:00:38.491 --> 00:00:43.491
also having an abnormal weight early in life can change the risk of obesity as

9
00:00:43.561 --> 00:00:47.670
an adult.
So it's a condition that has many causes.

10
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.450
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

11
00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.980
<v 0>The definition of someone is obese is anyone with a body mass index greater than</v>

12
00:00:53.981 --> 00:00:57.930
30
to put that in context,

13
00:00:57.931 --> 00:01:02.931
in 1900 the average body mass mass index of American men between 40 and 60 was

14
00:01:03.601 --> 00:01:08.601
23 by 2000 it was 27.5 in 2008 more than 15% of us adolescence,

15
00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.070
we're obese.
Obesity is a major global health issue.

16
00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.460
Mismatch now is contributing to obesity through energy balance,

17
00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.760
through food quality,
through changes in sleep,

18
00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.240
changes in our microbiota that results from less breastfeeding and more Securian

19
00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.580
deliveries and under and over nourishment of infants and children.

20
00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:38.500
So first energy balance.

21
00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:44.160
Basically that is the product of too much food and too little exercise.

22
00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:50.130
So the image on the left is a group of people who were hunter gatherers and the

23
00:01:51.551 --> 00:01:52.720
late 19th century.

24
00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.410
On the right there is an office worker in the late 19th century,

25
00:01:56.411 --> 00:01:59.050
early 20th century.
Uh,

26
00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.740
that is a shift from an active foraging lifestyle to a sedentary lifestyle.

27
00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.810
The physical activity level is defined as the total daily energy output divided

28
00:02:13.361 --> 00:02:16.420
by the basal metabolic rate.
In hunter gatherers,

29
00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.450
it's about 1.85 in farmers is about 1.78 to 1.8599999999999999 so farmers can be

30
00:02:23.591 --> 00:02:27.430
working just as hard as hunter gatherers and office workers.

31
00:02:27.431 --> 00:02:32.431
It's about 1.512 1.6099999999999999 what that means is that if a hunter gatherer

32
00:02:33.791 --> 00:02:38.791
farmer changes to the lifestyle of an office worker while continuing to eat the

33
00:02:38.911 --> 00:02:41.500
3000 calories a day that he used to need,

34
00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.720
then he will have an energy surplus of about 450 calories a day.

35
00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.420
That's enough to make him rapidly obese.

36
00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.880
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

37
00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.880
<v 0>If we look at food quality and compare the diets of hunter gatherers with</v>

38
00:02:57.251 --> 00:03:00.730
average Americans and with the US recommended daily allowance,

39
00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:06.960
basically what we see is that hunter gatherers had less carbohydrate,

40
00:03:07.631 --> 00:03:10.240
less sugar,
less fat and less sodium,

41
00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.380
and that our food quality compared to a hunter gatherers has less protein,

42
00:03:18.401 --> 00:03:20.980
fiber,
vitamin C and D and potassium

43
00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:23.981
hunter gatherers.

44
00:03:23.981 --> 00:03:27.160
We're actually getting a reasonable amount of fat in their diet,

45
00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.550
but it was less saturated fat.

46
00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:37.410
They had considerably more fiber in their diet than we do and they were getting

47
00:03:39.191 --> 00:03:41.620
a lot more potassium and a lot less sodium.

48
00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.180
These are all things that are feeding into mismatch diseases.

49
00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:47.753
<v 1>Okay,</v>

50
00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.840
<v 0>so if we have a lot of refined starch and sugar in our diet,</v>

51
00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:57.760
then we get a spike in blood sugar that results from simple starches that

52
00:03:57.761 --> 00:04:02.080
stimulates the pancreas to produce insulin that causes blood sugar to be taken

53
00:04:02.081 --> 00:04:03.610
up by muscle and fat cells.

54
00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.160
There is now so much sugar and starch and our dye that the spike is unnatural

55
00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.840
and stimulates too much insulin and that causes blood sugar then to crash.

56
00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:20.070
We then get hungry and we overeat and that will not occur if we were eating

57
00:04:20.861 --> 00:04:24.160
complex starches and sugars that were associated with fiber.

58
00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:30.090
So refined starches and simple sugars result in an overproduction of insulin and

59
00:04:33.521 --> 00:04:38.521
that causes blood sugar to crash and that makes us hungry again much sooner than

60
00:04:39.101 --> 00:04:39.934
we should be.

61
00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:46.570
Another thing that influences our appetite is sleep deprivation and Graylin.

62
00:04:46.571 --> 00:04:50.050
Here are two to deprive men passing out on a park bench.

63
00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:54.820
Hunter Gatherers get eight to nine hours of sleep at night and they take a two

64
00:04:54.821 --> 00:04:56.680
hour nap in the afternoon,

65
00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:01.000
so they are actually getting nearly an average of 10 hours of sleep a day.

66
00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:03.580
Modern American sleep,

67
00:05:03.581 --> 00:05:07.120
six to seven hours at night and only a third of them take naps.

68
00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:12.570
So that's the asleep deficit of somewhere in the neighborhood of three to four

69
00:05:14.231 --> 00:05:15.280
hours per day.

70
00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:16.603
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

71
00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.070
<v 0>Sleep deprivation reduces cell repair.</v>

72
00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:25.190
It cuts down on immune function and it increases cortisol which raises blood

73
00:05:25.321 --> 00:05:29.370
sugar if high levels of cortisol persist,

74
00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.330
they depressed immune function in the increased the risk of type two diabetes.

75
00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:40.230
Sleep deprivation causes the levels of Leptin which inhibits appetite to fall

76
00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:44.220
and the levels of Ghrelin which stimulates appetite to rise,

77
00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:49.770
sleep deprived,
deprived people are therefore hungry and they crave carbohydrates

78
00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:57.010
so our bodies interprets sleep deprivation is a stress the needs to be with

79
00:05:57.831 --> 00:06:02.831
increased food intake and it is no longer reliably associated with the kinds of

80
00:06:03.771 --> 00:06:06.110
stress that needs increased food intake.

81
00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:14.420
There are two other important cultural innovations that have gone on.

82
00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:18.140
One is that there is less breastfeeding and the second is that there are more

83
00:06:18.141 --> 00:06:18.974
c-sections.

84
00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:25.680
One study found that breastfed babies were 13 pounds lighter at 14 years of age

85
00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:32.010
and babies that have been fed formula breast milk contains illegal saccharides

86
00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:35.500
that stimulate the growth of beneficial bacteria and infant guts.

87
00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:41.040
So some of this may be mediated by the establishment of a gut flora that can

88
00:06:41.681 --> 00:06:43.930
mediate this uptake of energy.

89
00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:50.660
A study of 1,255 children in Boston found that birth by csection doubles the

90
00:06:52.021 --> 00:06:55.320
risk of obesity at age three compared to a vaginal birth.

91
00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:01.200
The intestinal Microbiota of infants that are born by csection resembles that of

92
00:07:01.201 --> 00:07:05.250
maternal skin,
not that of maternal vagina and anus.

93
00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:08.120
<v 1>Okay.</v>

94
00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:11.060
<v 0>Another effect is abnormal weight.
Early in life,</v>

95
00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:17.120
as we've seen earlier with our discussion of the Dutch hunger,
hunger winter,

96
00:07:17.121 --> 00:07:21.830
the nutritional status of fetus in Utero and of infants and young children

97
00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:25.490
produces a delayed effect on the risk of adult disease.

98
00:07:25.491 --> 00:07:30.290
This is the doe had or developmental origins of health and disease framework.

99
00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:31.730
<v 1>Okay.</v>

100
00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:35.870
<v 0>Under nursing,
infants and children have a greater risk of obesity,
diabetes,</v>

101
00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:39.550
cardiovascular disease,
and hypertension is adults that didn't.

102
00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:41.870
This is caused by insulin resistance.

103
00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:47.310
This might be a predictive adaptive response that anticipates future few food

104
00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:52.580
shortage,
or it might be designed to protect infant brain during development.

105
00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:56.060
We can't really be sure which of those is the correct explanation.

106
00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:57.860
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

107
00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:02.480
<v 0>Children who are overweight also have increased risk of obesity as adults.</v>

108
00:08:02.481 --> 00:08:06.590
So if you're too thin or if you're too heavy as a child,

109
00:08:06.591 --> 00:08:08.330
you have increased risk of obesity.

110
00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:13.730
The expansion of the visceral fat mass may change appetite and body weight set

111
00:08:13.731 --> 00:08:18.731
points and perpetuate over overeating because persistent high levels of Leptin

112
00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:25.670
Produce Leptin resistance and that produces increased appetite and decreased

113
00:08:25.671 --> 00:08:29.390
energy expenditure.
So to summarize,

114
00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:32.780
the causes of obesity are many.
The treatments are numerous.

115
00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:37.280
People become obese because they eat too much and exercise too little.

116
00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:41.060
They eat processed food that produce insulin spikes.

117
00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:43.610
They have particular genes,

118
00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:47.000
they are sleep deprived and produced more Graylin.

119
00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:52.040
Their microbiota had been disturbed by infant formula or by c section,

120
00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:55.640
or they were over or under nourished his children.

121
00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:59.990
So it is a multifactorial causal chain,

122
00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:05.560
but it is producing one of the major epidemics that currently threatened the

123
00:09:05.721 --> 00:09:07.730
health of contemporary populations.
