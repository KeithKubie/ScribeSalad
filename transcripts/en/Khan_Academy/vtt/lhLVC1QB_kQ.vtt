00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:04.780
Bill has 198 marbles
in this collection.

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:07.350
He then buys another 44.

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.410
A year later, he decides he
has had enough of marbles

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.660
and decides to split them
as evenly as possible

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.600
between the other 31
students in his math class.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.897
Roughly how many marbles will
each of his classmates get?

00:00:22.897 --> 00:00:24.730
And the fact that we
have the word "roughly"

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.260
here means we don't need
to get the exact answer.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.080
If it said roughly
or estimate how many

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.750
marbles each of his classmates
will get, that says, hey,

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.280
maybe we can round these
numbers a little bit

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.700
to make our calculations
a little bit easier.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.550
So let's give a go at that.

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.130
So we start with 198 marbles.

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:43.130
Well, let's round everything
to the nearest ten,

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.250
and maybe that'll
simplify things.

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.570
So 198, if we were to round
it to the nearest ten,

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.780
well, we'd want to
look at the ones place.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.970
The ones place we have an 8.

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.594
If you have a ones place
that's 5 or greater,

00:00:57.594 --> 00:00:59.260
then you're going to
round up, if you're

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.170
going to round to
the nearest ten.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.790
So the nearest ten, if you round
up from 198 is actually 200.

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:08.150
We'll just go up to 200.

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.056
That's also the nearest hundred.

00:01:10.056 --> 00:01:14.710
So this is approximately
equal to 200.

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.740
And this little
squiggly equal sign,

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.100
that means roughly equal to
or approximately equal to.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.120
And so this is what
he starts off with.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.370
Then he buys another 44.

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:30.010
44 is approximately equal to--
if we round to the nearest ten,

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:31.580
we look at our ones place.

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.960
It's less than 5, so we're going
to round to the ten below 44.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.880
The ten below 44 is 40.

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.690
If we go to the nearest
ten going down, we get 240.

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:45.520
So how many total
marbles did he have

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:46.970
before he distributes them?

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.570
Well, if we take our two rough
estimates and if we add them,

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:58.080
200 plus 40-- he has roughly
240 marbles before he

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.044
distributes them.

00:01:59.044 --> 00:02:00.460
Now, how many
students is he going

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.070
to distribute them between?

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.010
Well, there's a
total of 31 students.

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.220
There's 31 students, but
once again, let's round this.

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.949
If we round this
to the nearest ten

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:13.871
we're going to round down,
because our ones place has a 1

00:02:13.871 --> 00:02:14.370
in it.

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.030
It's less than 5.

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.650
So we're going to round
to the ten below 31.

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.530
So that is going to be 30.

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.560
So if you have
roughly 240 marbles

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.380
and you're going to distribute
them amongst roughly 30 folks,

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.550
then how many are each
of them going to get?

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:36.810
Well, each of them are going
to get 240 divided by 30.

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.470
Once again this is just a rough
estimate-- roughly 240 marbles

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.650
divided by 30 folks.

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.900
Well, what's 240 divided by 30?

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:53.250
Well, if we say that this
is equal to the marbles

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.690
per student, so let's say
that this is M-- M for marbles

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:06.470
per student-- this is another
way of saying that M times 30

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:12.220
is equal to 240, or that
240 is equal to M times 30.

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.550
Let me write it that way.

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.150
So that's the same
thing as saying

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.937
that 240 is equal
to M times 30, where

00:03:19.937 --> 00:03:21.520
M is what we're
trying to figure out--

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.830
the rough number of
marbles per student.

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.150
So let's think about what M is.

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.140
And there's a bunch of
ways we could do it.

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:34.080
We could just look at our
multiples of 30, so 30, 60, 90.

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.560
Notice, this is very similar
taking to multiples of 3,

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:37.970
but we just have a 0 now.

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.470
The multiples of 3 are
now in the tens place,

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.460
and now we have a 0
in the ones place.

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:56.934
90, 120, which is just a 12
with a 0, 150, 180, 210, 240,

00:03:56.934 --> 00:03:57.600
so what is this?

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.807
This is 30 times one, two,
three, four, five, six, seven,

00:04:01.807 --> 00:04:03.130
eight.

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:07.320
So we know that 240 is
equal to 30 times 8.

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:12.150
So we could write 240 is
equal to-- and 30 times 8

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:17.610
is the same thing as 8 times
30, is equal to 8 times 30.

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.010
Or another way we could say
it is the number of marbles

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.780
each of his friends is
going to get is roughly 8.

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.770
So this is going to be 8.

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:34.750
So each of his classmates is
going to get roughly 8 marbles.

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:36.260
Once again, this is an estimate.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.064
It's not an exact answer.

00:04:38.064 --> 00:04:40.730
Now, you might have tried to get
a slightly more precise answer.

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:44.070
If you didn't want
to round 198 and 44,

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:45.950
you could have
just added the two.

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:53.270
8 plus 4 is 12, and then
1 plus 9 plus 4 is 14.

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:54.910
1 plus 1 is 2.

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:56.990
So the exact number
of marbles he had

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:59.640
was 242, which is
pretty close to 240.

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.620
So 240 was a good approximation.

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.020
And then when you divide
that by-- dividing it by 31

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.405
is a bit of a pain, and
luckily we can just estimate.

00:05:07.405 --> 00:05:11.440
So we divided by
30, and we got 8.

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:15.530
And just as another kind
of aside here, notice,

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:21.860
24 divided by 3 is equal to 8.

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:32.230
And if you divide 240 divided
by 30, this is also equal to 8.

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:34.440
So if you divide something
10 times as large

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.334
by something 10 times
as large, you're

00:05:36.334 --> 00:05:37.750
still going to get
the same value.

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:40.110
But either way, each
of his classmates

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:42.630
are going to get
roughly 8 marbles.
