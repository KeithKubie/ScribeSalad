00:00:12.381 --> 00:00:14.158
Boy in blue: Our teacher
would have the textbook

00:00:14.158 --> 00:00:17.256
up on the overhead projector
so we could all see it.

00:00:17.256 --> 00:00:21.855
Boy in gray: We kind of just sat there
and we did like different sections.

00:00:21.855 --> 00:00:25.933
Girl in green: i'm a daydreamer
so I kind of zone out sometimes.

00:00:25.933 --> 00:00:28.823
Boy in blue: Read the lesson
and then we would get homework.

00:00:28.823 --> 00:00:31.658
Girl in green: There's always
at the end of each section.

00:00:31.658 --> 00:00:33.453
Boy in blue: Yeah,
that's how it was before.

00:00:33.453 --> 00:00:36.447
Girl in green: I used to
get like B's all the time

00:00:36.447 --> 00:00:40.821
but since Khan Academy it's brought
me up to an A so that was really cool.

00:00:40.835 --> 00:00:45.522
Girl in pink: In a way I use Khan
Academy is I do the exercises

00:00:45.522 --> 00:00:48.906
and it really helps me
improve my Math skills,

00:00:48.906 --> 00:00:53.917
and I watch the videos if I'm having
trouble with some of the exercises,

00:00:53.917 --> 00:00:57.108
and then I'm able to get a streak of 10.

00:00:57.108 --> 00:01:01.087
Boy with eyeglass: She can see what you're
doing and so if you're messing around

00:01:01.087 --> 00:01:04.313
she'll tell you to just
do these set of problems.

00:01:04.313 --> 00:01:07.182
If you're really struggling with
it she'll help you out with it,

00:01:07.182 --> 00:01:10.038
if you just don't get what the
video is trying to ask you.

00:01:10.038 --> 00:01:12.842
Girl in pink: I like how it's
different than the Math book

00:01:12.842 --> 00:01:15.739
when everyone's doing pretty
much the same level of things,

00:01:15.739 --> 00:01:18.630
and if you're like higher
then it's boring for them.

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.240
If they're like lower they're
not exactly understanding it.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.751
Girl in pink: I used to be afraid to
like tell her what I'm struggling on

00:01:25.751 --> 00:01:29.509
and now that she can see how
we're doing on the Khan Academy

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:33.256
it helps me feel more
comfortable talking to her

00:01:33.256 --> 00:01:35.070
about what I'm having trouble with.

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.924
Boy in blue: You get to move
at your own pace with it

00:01:36.924 --> 00:01:39.396
because there are all sorts
of challenging exercises

00:01:39.396 --> 00:01:40.798
and there are easy exercises.

00:01:40.798 --> 00:01:43.920
Girl in pink: It's really fun
because you can try to get badges

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.502
and you can challenge yourself
and do different kinds of Math.

00:01:46.502 --> 00:01:49.408
Boy in black: There's meteor
badge, moon badge, earth badge,

00:01:49.408 --> 00:01:51.042
sun badge, and black hole badge.

00:01:51.042 --> 00:01:56.603
Girl in green: I didn't really remember
exponents even though I did it once.

00:01:56.603 --> 00:01:59.674
I didn't remember it very much
and then I watched the video

00:01:59.674 --> 00:02:02.903
and now I know exponents, really easy.

00:02:02.903 --> 00:02:07.552
Boy in blue: The guy who makes them,
Sal, he teaches the subject really well.

00:02:07.552 --> 00:02:10.258
Girl in pink: It's like he's
probably like writing on the computer

00:02:10.258 --> 00:02:13.723
because it shows this little mouse
and he talks into the microphone.

00:02:13.723 --> 00:02:18.694
He explains all the subjects in a way,
it just makes it really easy to learn.

00:02:18.694 --> 00:02:20.754
Boy in black: Well my parents
think it's really cool,

00:02:20.754 --> 00:02:22.913
they think it's a great idea
that we're doing this site.

00:02:22.913 --> 00:02:26.246
The good thing is we don't have
to be at school to learn Math.

00:02:26.246 --> 00:02:28.973
We can just be at home on our
computers basically doing it.

00:02:28.973 --> 00:02:30.620
Girl in pink: Like if it's a
rainy day you can just do it

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.066
and then you can energy
points and get badges.

00:02:33.066 --> 00:02:35.633
Boy in blue: I really like it when I
finish one of the really hard ones.

00:02:35.633 --> 00:02:37.053
Boy with eyeglass: It's a tool for life.

00:02:37.053 --> 00:02:40.544
Everybody needs to know how
to do certain things in Math,

00:02:40.544 --> 00:02:42.472
not just if you're going to be

00:02:42.472 --> 00:02:46.724
like an astronomist you
have to know everything.

00:02:46.724 --> 00:02:49.862
Boy in gray: One night I was
just working on this lesson

00:02:49.862 --> 00:02:51.706
and I just couldn't finish it.

00:02:51.706 --> 00:02:57.079
My Dad said you can't play with your
friends until you finish that lesson.

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:02.568
Then i finally finished it because I
watched the video and I really learned it.
