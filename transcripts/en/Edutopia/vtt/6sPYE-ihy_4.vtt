00:00:11.616 --> 00:00:13.236
&gt;&gt;Adam: Great, thank you.

00:00:13.496 --> 00:00:16.746
So you take your jete role,
you need to run that way.

00:00:16.746 --> 00:00:20.716
&gt;&gt;Cristina: The power of arts
education is that the students learn

00:00:20.716 --> 00:00:22.736
that it's okay to make mistakes.

00:00:23.306 --> 00:00:24.646
It's okay, to fumble.

00:00:25.156 --> 00:00:26.836
It's okay to make bad work.

00:00:27.096 --> 00:00:31.446
In fact, you need to make bad work
in order to get to the good work.

00:00:37.626 --> 00:00:40.756
&gt;&gt;Cindy: We're a state-wide
charter, created so that students

00:00:40.756 --> 00:00:43.576
from across New Mexico could
access arts programming,

00:00:43.576 --> 00:00:45.246
and academically prepare for college.

00:00:45.986 --> 00:00:48.016
They attend a dual curriculum program.

00:00:48.146 --> 00:00:49.966
They're in the academic
block in the morning,

00:00:50.476 --> 00:00:52.826
and then arts block in the afternoon.

00:00:53.516 --> 00:00:57.676
&gt;&gt;Serena: [singing]

00:00:58.176 --> 00:01:00.046
&gt;&gt;Serena: At two o'clock
every single day,

00:01:00.046 --> 00:01:02.746
we work on art, we hone it, we practice.

00:01:02.996 --> 00:01:06.486
And those periods are really us
learning how to perform in others

00:01:06.636 --> 00:01:07.746
with a smaller group first.

00:01:08.156 --> 00:01:11.436
And when you get up and you don't your
music, it's not great, it's not fun.

00:01:11.996 --> 00:01:12.886
You have to put the work in.

00:01:12.946 --> 00:01:13.826
It's required.

00:01:13.876 --> 00:01:14.866
There's no way to get around it.

00:01:15.676 --> 00:01:18.456
&gt;&gt;Geron: The strengths and skills
that these artists come to us

00:01:18.456 --> 00:01:24.386
with are hard work, and just
a willingness to keep trying.

00:01:24.386 --> 00:01:25.636
They have perseverance.

00:01:25.636 --> 00:01:29.256
They take constructive criticism
well, and they build on it.

00:01:29.256 --> 00:01:31.526
&gt;&gt;Serena: There's so much going
around him, and despite all of it,

00:01:32.016 --> 00:01:33.826
he's still happy, and
he's still playing.

00:01:34.186 --> 00:01:36.196
&gt;&gt;Student: So I'm gonna
disagree that he's happy.

00:01:36.276 --> 00:01:39.336
I don't think he really is wrapped
up in his own fantasy either.

00:01:39.336 --> 00:01:42.826
&gt;&gt;Serena: Being able to accept
critique and not feel hurt

00:01:42.826 --> 00:01:46.706
by it is an important skill for us to
learn, and we're taking those critiques

00:01:46.706 --> 00:01:48.406
and learning how to put them to use.

00:01:48.636 --> 00:01:53.206
&gt;&gt;Santana: So many times when
you have people critiquing you,

00:01:53.206 --> 00:01:56.716
they will tell you, "Take it back
to the beginning and start again,

00:01:56.716 --> 00:01:59.536
because you'll discover things
that you didn't find before."

00:01:59.536 --> 00:02:01.866
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Good, all
right, so when you get here,

00:02:01.866 --> 00:02:04.796
make sure you get a really clean pedal
on the B-flat, but that was great.

00:02:04.856 --> 00:02:06.316
That's the kind of energy you want.

00:02:06.316 --> 00:02:10.306
&gt;&gt;Santana: I take their feedback, and I
use it to construct something greater,

00:02:10.306 --> 00:02:12.976
rather than taking it hurtfully.

00:02:19.066 --> 00:02:21.996
&gt;&gt;Brass: I kind of take it
upon myself to come and listen

00:02:21.996 --> 00:02:25.396
to Santana play sometimes
and give her a little bit

00:02:25.396 --> 00:02:27.296
of sage advice from the senior.

00:02:27.296 --> 00:02:29.016
The feedback is a second set of ears.

00:02:29.566 --> 00:02:32.266
&gt;&gt;Brass: There are almost two
conversations, two lines, two waves,

00:02:32.906 --> 00:02:34.306
and the real illustration--

00:02:34.306 --> 00:02:35.816
&gt;&gt;Neil: When people say
practice makes perfect,

00:02:35.816 --> 00:02:37.676
and practice doesn't make perfect.

00:02:37.676 --> 00:02:38.616
Practice makes permanent.

00:02:38.616 --> 00:02:41.556
So if you practice the
mistake over and over and over,

00:02:41.916 --> 00:02:43.856
you have just gotten
really good at a mistake.

00:02:43.986 --> 00:02:47.026
So I think it's important to recognize
and then explain it to the students.

00:02:47.356 --> 00:02:50.006
As long as they're learning from
those mistakes they're moving forward.

00:02:50.216 --> 00:02:52.216
&gt;&gt;Class: [applause]

00:02:52.426 --> 00:02:55.046
&gt;&gt;Joey: You will be seeing
the fundamental students doing

00:02:55.046 --> 00:02:56.186
"Working in Silence."

00:02:56.256 --> 00:02:57.476
So you'll see the piece.

00:02:57.476 --> 00:02:59.146
The faculty will give a
little bit of feedback,

00:02:59.146 --> 00:03:00.156
and then they will do it again.

00:03:00.516 --> 00:03:01.976
&gt;&gt;Joey: I believe that you
don't end on a mistake.

00:03:02.266 --> 00:03:05.916
In the education process, you
know, oftentimes it's, "Okay,

00:03:05.916 --> 00:03:09.146
you did that wrong; tomorrow we're
going to move on to something else."

00:03:09.146 --> 00:03:11.886
So even in my rehearsal process,
it's like, "Let's correct that.

00:03:11.886 --> 00:03:14.706
Let's end with a victory, or you
getting something out of it."

00:03:15.066 --> 00:03:17.286
&gt;&gt;Kara: We've been getting to do
them a couple of different times,

00:03:17.516 --> 00:03:20.076
which really helps, because then
we get to take the feedback,

00:03:20.076 --> 00:03:23.376
and we get to apply it, and that
is the whole learning process,

00:03:23.876 --> 00:03:29.386
is that if you fail, then you
know, you can do it again,

00:03:29.386 --> 00:03:33.756
and you can just make big leaps
and bounds and learn from that.

00:03:34.106 --> 00:03:37.266
&gt;&gt;Camille: When we working with
this scene before in the classroom,

00:03:37.266 --> 00:03:40.956
we got a lot of negative feedback,
and it was totally trashed

00:03:40.956 --> 00:03:43.786
and our teacher said,
"Well, it's workable."

00:03:43.786 --> 00:03:45.596
[laughs] and we're like,
"What does that mean?"

00:03:45.696 --> 00:03:49.476
So we decided together
that we would change it,

00:03:49.476 --> 00:03:52.006
and decide to make something
new and better.

00:03:52.106 --> 00:03:53.486
&gt;&gt;Teacher: You haven't
pulled it off yet.

00:03:53.846 --> 00:03:55.476
Right now we're scratching our heads

00:03:55.476 --> 00:04:00.596
and wondering why these two mutes
[laughter] have bumped into each other.

00:04:00.776 --> 00:04:02.356
And yeah? So--

00:04:02.356 --> 00:04:05.526
&gt;&gt;Joey: It's hard to hear criticism,
because who in the heck wants to fail?

00:04:05.576 --> 00:04:06.966
Who in the heck wants to do it wrong?

00:04:08.276 --> 00:04:13.266
So they have to think back,
reassess, do it right.

00:04:13.616 --> 00:04:14.966
And then they own it.

00:04:15.046 --> 00:04:15.966
&gt;&gt;Joey: Because you're
going to do it again,

00:04:15.966 --> 00:04:17.856
do you have a sense of
what we're asking?

00:04:18.306 --> 00:04:19.086
&gt;&gt;Joey: Okay, go ahead!

00:04:19.746 --> 00:04:21.196
&gt;&gt;Camille: This is the place to fail.

00:04:21.196 --> 00:04:23.686
If you're gonna fail
anywhere, it's here and now.

00:04:23.686 --> 00:04:29.826
&gt;&gt;Camille: And because of your
failure, you can go somewhere better.

00:04:30.896 --> 00:04:35.246
&gt;&gt;Cristina: Great art comes from
risk-taking, from being willing to fail.

00:04:35.536 --> 00:04:39.836
That's something that is so
unique to learning in the arts.

00:04:40.026 --> 00:04:42.196
&gt;&gt;Adam: Failure is inevitable.

00:04:42.366 --> 00:04:44.236
Critical feedback is essential

00:04:44.236 --> 00:04:46.876
to growing oneself as
a person in the world.

00:04:46.876 --> 00:04:46.966
&gt;&gt;Adam: Good!

00:04:46.966 --> 00:04:50.616
&gt;&gt;Cristina: It's just so
great to watch a student go

00:04:50.616 --> 00:04:52.226
through that process of struggle.

00:04:52.916 --> 00:04:54.376
Have a teacher believe in them.

00:04:54.376 --> 00:04:59.366
And then at the end, they really have
a result that they can be proud of.

00:04:59.366 --> 00:05:00.450
&gt;&gt;Class: [applause and cheers]
