- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape;
bipedal, naked large-brained. Lone the

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:38.650
master of fire, tools and language, but
still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:48.630
Aware that death is inevitable, yet filled
with optimism. We grow up slowly. We hand

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:56.130
down knowledge. We empathize and deceive.
We shape the future from our shared

understanding of the past. CARTA brings
together experts from diverse disciplines

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:11.330

- [Johannes] So thanks for the invitation.
So I would like to talk today about a more

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.470
recent chapter in human history. So we
have heard a lot about the early chapters

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.320
of human history today about the early
evolution of modern humans in Africa and

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:20.230
also about the interaction between archaic
humans and early modern humans. But I

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:26.440
would like to talk today and turn our
focus from the ice age, the Pleistocene,

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.550
into the Holocene into the last 10,000
years of human history and I try to

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.300
convince you that this is also an
extremely exciting time period where we

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.160
even see a lot of changes even in human
evolution into human phenotype in several

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:45.460
parts of the world. So as I mentioned,
we're actually living today in this time

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:50.200
period, the Holocene which is a time
period of relative climate stability, some

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.470
people might even say that we have
actually changed our environment so much

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.590
that we're now living in a time period
which we call the Anthropocene which might

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.140
have started in the last 2,000 years but
the main focus of this talk should really

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:08.790
be the Holocene, so the last 10,000 years
of human history. Most of this time period

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.200
actually we do not have historical
documents so we have no information that

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:18.500
people wrote down about human history in
this last 10,000 years where we usually

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.400
have to rely on archeological information
for example, or paleo-anthropological

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.640
findings, so human skeletons for example
that might tell us something about things

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.840
that changed in the past the same thing
for example like migration, genetic

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.730
admixture or the genetic turnover of the
human population. But we and others have

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:44.160
actually started in the last few years to
use genetic data to tell us something

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:50.600
about changes that happened recently in
our evolution or in human history and I

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:55.350
would like to focus my talk today about
one event that archeologists had already

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:59.850
identified many years ago and that is
probably the biggest change in human

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:05.490
history that happened in the last few
million years and it's actually the change

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:11.140
from the subsistence strategy of hunting
and gathering, to Neolithic farmers that

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:15.650
relied on agriculture and started to
domesticate animals. And this revolution,

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:20.610
this big change in human history is called
the Neolithic Revolution. So this

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:25.350
Neolithic Revolution started in central
Europe about seven and half thousand years

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:29.690
ago and in other parts of the world a few
thousand years earlier and a few thousand

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:36.150
years later. But this big change is really
the cornerstone of our modern civilization

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.360
because it provided people then with
resources that actually allow us to

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:45.750
sustain millions and even billions of
people today and that basically came with

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:50.080
this big change from this foraging
lifestyle to this early farming lifestyle.

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:56.190
What archeologist have debated for more
than 100 years now is whether this change

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:02.190
of subsistence strategy from foraging to
farming was actually related due to the

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:08.000
spread of ideas and culture. So was it
just cultured ideas that were passed on

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.660
from village or from region to region or
was it actually people that were bringing

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:16.760
agriculture to different parts of the
world? For example, to central Europe

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:22.080
about 7,000 years ago. So this big
question, was it pots or people that

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:27.970
basically then spread agriculture into
Europe and other parts of the world. And

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:32.690
this question is very hard to address just
based on archeological artifacts, for

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:37.020
example, or anthropological findings
because it is very difficult to really see

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:42.240
if biological identity of people changes
just based on archeological artifact. And

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:46.870
this is actually a question which is much
easier to address if we look at genetic

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:50.910
data. So if we look at the DNA, if we look
at the genetic makeup of the people

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:55.820
because it makes very clear predictions
for this two different hypothesis, whether

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:59.610
it was ideas that were spreading during
that time or whether it was actually

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:03.360
people.
So if we assume that ideas and culture

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:07.400
was, for example, spreading and
agriculture, we would expect that there

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.750
would be direct genetic continuity
between, for example, the first people

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:16.750
that lived in Europe, foragers 10,000
years ago, and then the first Neolithic

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:20.740
people and then the people that live in
Europe today. So you would see genetic

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:26.720
continuity if it was just the spread of
ideas. However if it was actually people

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:31.130
spreading agriculture, for example, into
Europe we would expect the genetic

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:37.200
discontinuity, something that's called
"demic diffusion," we would actually see

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:42.140
that people would then, for example, come
to Europe and change the genetic structure

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:46.870
so new genes would arrive, for example, in
Europe. And we and many others have tried

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:50.370
to address this question based on
mitochondria but as you have seen in some

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:54.380
of the previous talks, mitochondrial DNA
can be quite decisive. So therefore we

00:06:54.380 --> 00:07:00.330
have decided then in the last few years to
actually study whole genomes of early

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:05.170
farmers as well as late hunter-gatherers,
so ancient foragers, to study this

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:08.990
question whether there was actually
genetic change of people when agriculture

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:13.690
was introduced to Europe, or whether there
was direct genetic continuity. So we have

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:18.450
sequenced genomes of about 12 early
hunter-gatherers some years ago and

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:22.780
combined that with data sets that had been
provided by other people, for example,

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:28.470
like the Iceman genome. This famous
Tyrolean mummy that was discovered a few

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:33.070
years ago and was actually frozen for
about 5,000 years in the Alps. As well as

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:38.560
a genome from a hunter-gatherer that was
found here in Spain some years ago. And we

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:44.270
then compared those ancient human genomes
with the genome of about 2,000 people that

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:48.350
come from various populations, about 200
populations in the world today with the

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:51.620
data set that is called the "Human
Origins" data set that is based

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:56.420
genome-wide data of now up to 5,000 people
from many different populations in the

00:07:56.420 --> 00:08:01.410
world. If you then take genomic data from
ancient and modern people and you want to

00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:04.620
compare that, you can imagine you have
heard those genomes are really big,

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:09.290
there's a lot of data and one way to break
down this data into two dimensions that

00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:13.090
you can actually look at is a so-called
principal component analysis, where you

00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:17.360
basically take this genetic information
from all those people and break it down

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:21.670
into two most informative components,
principal component one and two. And if

00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:26.870
you do that for modern people, you get
those beautiful, colorful clouds that you

00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:31.570
see here. And actually if you look at the
right cloud here, this cloud is actually

00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:36.370
people that live today in Northern Africa,
in the near East as well as in the

00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:41.210
Caucasus. We actually see this climb that
stretches from Northern Africa into the

00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:46.430
Caucasus. Those populations here are
populations that live in Europe today. So

00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:52.420
people that live for example in Iberia,
France, Central Europe as well as Great

00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:57.560
Britain or Russia. What you actually see
here almost resembles geography. If you

00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:01.240
imagine this as kind of the Northern
African coast, this is in near East, here

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:05.270
could be the Black Sea, this could be the
Mediterranean. So it could be an isolation

00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:08.950
by distance, people moved into those
places and then basically genetically

00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:14.590
slowly changed over time. However, if we
now look at our ancient individuals, our

00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:19.520
ancient foragers as well as the early
farmers from 7,000 years ago, we first see

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:23.930
that our ancient foragers are genetically
actually quite distinct from the people

00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:28.490
that live in Europe today. Now there seems
to have been not a strong continuity

00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:32.190
between the ancient foragers and modern
Europeans. So basically no modern

00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:36.990
Europeans that live today that looked
genetically like ancient foragers. This is

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:40.380
actually different for the ancient
farmers. So those 7,000 year old farmers

00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:44.870
from Central Europe they actually do
cluster with populations that live in

00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:48.470
Europe today. You could see this little
green cloud here. If you look at this

00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:53.210
cloud, this is actually people that live
in Sardinia today. And this was already

00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:58.470
discovered when the Iceman genome was
sequenced some years ago. The colleagues

00:09:58.470 --> 00:10:01.810
actually found that the Iceman looked
genetically very similar to people that

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:05.740
live in Sardinia today, and that actually
made them also to hypothesize that maybe

00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:12.060
he was some sort of tourist from Sardinia
that had gotten lost in the Alps and just

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:17.830
died there and froze to death. Today we
actually know that this was not quite the

00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:21.900
case because we now have genomic data from
many early farmers, from Scandinavia, from

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:26.320
Iberia, from Central Europe, from Southern
Europe and they all cluster together with

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:29.880
Sardinians. So it is not that they all
come from Sardinia, it is rather that

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:34.780
modern Sardinians look genetically like
early farmers. But what you then also see

00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:39.470
is that people that live in Europe today
are not just a simple mixture between

00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:44.460
those ancient populations, so the foragers
and the farmers, we actually stretch all

00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:48.380
the way up here and if you can actually
see those little diamonds up there, that

00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:53.180
some more ancient genomes which are on
this plot that are actually populations

00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:57.597
which we call "Ancient North Eurasians"
which are best represented by people that

00:10:57.597 --> 00:11:02.030
lived about 10,000 20,000 years ago in
Siberia. For example, one child that was

00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:05.980
sequenced by the group in Copenhagen from
Lake Baykal which is called the Malta

00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:11.320
child. So you see that modern Europeans
seem to be a mixture between those three

00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:17.330
ancient genetic populations. But what is
also very clear is that if you look at

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:23.040
that, neither the ancient farmer nor the
ancient forager seem to have this North

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:26.650
Eurasian component. This North Eurasian
one is actually quite distinct and we

00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:31.740
wanted to find out when did this ancient
North Eurasian component arrive in Europe.

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:36.990
To do that, we teamed up with David Rice's
team as well as Svante Pääbo and collected

00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:42.890
also data from the team in Copenhagen and
now put together a data set of about 230

00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:48.240
ancient human genomes that span 8,000
years of European history to see when the

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:52.790
kind of different genetic components over
the last 8,000 years formed. So now we

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:58.760
actually go forward in time starting about
8,000 years ago and look at the genetic

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:01.530
structure of Europe.
What you see here in the background, those

00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:06.800
gray dots, are the modern populations and
those are the ancient individuals. So the

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:10.960
first thing you observe if you look at the
ancient foragers, so the indigenous

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:15.510
Europeans or Western Eurasians, you see
that they form this little cloud here and

00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:19.540
that there's a gradient from the west to
the east. So this was the genetic

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:24.360
structure of the hunter-gatherers that
lived in Europe about 8,000 years ago. If

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:30.600
you look at the same time into the region
here which is Turkey today, Anatolia, you

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:36.370
can see that the Anatolians at that time,
they already practiced agriculture, so

00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:39.810
they are Neolithic, so they're early
farmers. They're genetically, actually,

00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:44.240
quite distinct from those Europeans that
lived at the same time in Europe. If we

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:49.400
then move ahead in the next thousand
years, agriculture comes to Europe and

00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:52.550
suddenly when you look at the people that
lived in Europe at the time, they look

00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:57.430
exactly like those Anatolian Neolithic
farmers. So it seems very clear now that

00:12:57.430 --> 00:13:02.500
those Neolithic patches actually spread
with those people because Europeans

00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:06.510
suddenly looked like that and not look
like that anymore. So there is very strong

00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:09.810
evidence, now, that there was this
discontinuity of the people, that

00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:14.680
genetically there was this large change of
people at that time period about seven and

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:19.310
half thousand years ago in Central Europe.
If we now move in the next 2,000 years of

00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:23.190
human history in Europe, we can actually
see that the population structure doesn't

00:13:23.190 --> 00:13:28.110
really change so much. Genetically, people
look again quite similar to those early

00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:31.350
farmers from Anatolia, but you could
actually see a little bit of this movement

00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:35.290
in this direction and this is indeed
something that we observe that there seems

00:13:35.290 --> 00:13:40.310
to be a bit of genetic admixture with the
hunter-gatherers that lived in Europe at

00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:44.560
the time, probably still in mountain
ranges and in regions where agriculture

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:48.860
was not favorable. So there was a bit of
genetic admixture between those early

00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:53.360
farmers and the hunter-gatherers that were
living in Europe. However, again, this is

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:57.780
modern Europeans. They're not really
somewhere down here, so what's happening?

00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:03.170
We should kind of look a bit more to the
East, and this is the same time period

00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:07.460
that we just looked at in Central Europe
now looking at Eastern Europe so looking

00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:11.350
at the populations which are found here,
this north of the Black Sea, or the

00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:16.400
Caspian Sea. We can actually see that this
population which is Neolithic or Bronze

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:20.360
Age are steppe populations. So those are
also agriculturalists but they are not

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:25.150
sedentary but pastoralists, so they're
herding, for example, cows. And this

00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:30.030
population is very homogenous stretching
all kind of this region here and again

00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:33.870
they are kind of falling up here quite
distinct from the early farmers of Europe

00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:37.870
also quite distinct from the
hunter-gatherers. And you can actually see

00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:42.250
they are also pretty close to this
Eneolithic individuals here which are

00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:45.320
actually late hunter-gatherers from this
region. But they are a bit more stretched

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:49.720
in this direction in fact and there seems
to be something hiding here and something

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:54.490
I don't really have the time to talk today
about, but that would be a different

00:14:54.490 --> 00:14:59.170
chapter in human history. But what's now
going on with the modern Europeans that

00:14:59.170 --> 00:15:04.410
live today in Central Europe? When does
their genetic makeup actually form? And

00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:08.320
this is actually been happening about
4,800 years ago, 4,800 years ago and

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:16.070
suddenly you have a major shift in the
genetic structure of Europe. So if we move

00:15:16.070 --> 00:15:20.120
now to this time period 4,800 years ago to
about 3,000 years ago, suddenly you have

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:24.520
people in Central Europe that looked like
people that live in Central Europe today.

00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:28.510
So they are a genetic mixture of this
steppe component that we have in the

00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:33.330
Bronze Age here in the steppe, as well as
this early and middle Neolithic people

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:37.180
that you had in Central Europe at that
time. So there seems to be a massive event

00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:40.980
of migration. Suddenly you see this
massive shift and you don't only observe

00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:45.370
that in Central Europe and in Southern
Europe, but you even observe that in

00:15:45.370 --> 00:15:49.690
Central Asia as well as in the Altai,
there seems to be a very strong evidence

00:15:49.690 --> 00:15:54.490
now for a large migration. We can then
also quantify those genetic components in

00:15:54.490 --> 00:15:58.580
the different populations that live in
Europe today. So those three ancestral

00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:03.440
components the early foragers, the early
farmers, as well as this steppe

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:07.380
pastoralists. You can actually see there
is a climb, so populations that live in

00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:11.330
Northern Europe today or Northeastern
Europe they have quite a high amount of

00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:15.470
steppe ancestry and quite a low amount of
early farmer ancestry. Whereas the people

00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:20.180
that live in Sardinia today have almost
exclusively early farmer ancestry as I've

00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:25.900
shown you before and very, very little
ancestry here from the steppe. And if we

00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:30.230
look at the ancient populations, you can
actually see that if you move from back in

00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:34.500
time towards today, you can see that early
on we have this really strong component of

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:39.590
early farmer ancestry from Anatolia. Over
time you have a little bit of this forager

00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:44.400
indigenous European admixture that seems
to happen over the next few thousand

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:48.890
years. But then 4,800 years ago we
suddenly have this green component coming

00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:54.120
in, the steppe component. In Central
Europe we actually see about a 70%

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:59.650
replacement of the local agriculturalists
happening 4,800 years ago, an event that

00:16:59.650 --> 00:17:04.900
actually no archeologists or
paleo-anthropologists had predicted so

00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:08.970
far. So there seems to have really a mass
migration at the end of the Neolithic. So

00:17:08.970 --> 00:17:14.060
in summary, what we can say is that
agriculture likely spread from the near

00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:19.550
East through Anatolia into Central Europe,
starting about 7,000 to 8,000 years ago.

00:17:19.550 --> 00:17:24.320
So it was actually people coming to Europe
introducing agriculture. What we also have

00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:28.060
then, when the agriculturalists are
spreading in different parts of Europe or

00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:32.600
into Scandinavia in the next 2,000 years,
Great Britain as well as to Iberia, there

00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:36.440
seem to have a bit of genetic admixture
with the local hunter-gatherers that are

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:41.100
still present in Europe that time. And
then in the late Neolithic, about four and

00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:46.080
a half to 5,000 years ago, we have this
what seems to be massive migration coming

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:49.790
from this region here from a culture which
is called the Yamnaya, which is

00:17:49.790 --> 00:17:53.610
genetically extremely close with people
that have a culture which is called the

00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:57.920
Corded Ware that stretches all the way up
to the Baltics as well into Switzerland

00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:02.860
here and into Western Europe. So there was
this massive migration which expanded into

00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:07.580
the West here, into Central Europe as well
as into the other direction, into the

00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:12.660
Altai Mountains. One of the big questions
we currently have is how was that

00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:18.590
possible? We can easily explain why there
was this first migration of agriculture to

00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:22.650
Europe because you could imagine that
agriculture can sustain a much bigger

00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:26.460
population so the first people that
brought agriculture to Europe probably had

00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:31.380
a much bigger population size. But then
how was it possible that 5,000 years ago,

00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:36.160
those early farmers were replaced by other
farmers? So what did those farmers have

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:40.450
when they came here that kind of made them
able to replace the people that lived in

00:18:40.450 --> 00:18:43.690
Central Europe? And we don't really have a
good explanation currently but our

00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:46.950
colleagues from Copenhagen recently
published a study where they could

00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:51.150
actually find that in those people that
came to Europe, they actually found

00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:56.830
Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of
plague, which is actually quite incredible

00:18:56.830 --> 00:19:00.750
but it seems that during this time about
four and half thousand years ago, plague

00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:05.300
was for the first time introduced to
Europe, potentially causing a pandemic and

00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:08.770
you could imagine if we have a pandemic,
like for example during the Black Death

00:19:08.770 --> 00:19:12.800
where 50% of the people in Europe died. If
something like that happened five and half

00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:16.950
thousand years ago, it could open an
ecological niche so people could actually

00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:21.090
move in and then replace the local
farmers. Just briefly what we could also

00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:24.470
do is we could actually also look at the
genetic and phenotypic change through

00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:28.570
time. We could actually look at different
phenotypes, how they change over the last

00:19:28.570 --> 00:19:31.890
8,000 years, to look at evolution
basically and see, too. What we saw was

00:19:31.890 --> 00:19:36.980
actually quite surprising that the first
Europeans or the Europeans that lived

00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:40.770
about 8,000 years ago, the
hunter-gatherers, they actually had a very

00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:43.910
distinct phenotype from people that live
in Europe today. They actually have dark

00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:48.810
skin and blue eyes, all of them. You can
actually see that 100% frequency of those

00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:53.140
foragers had blue eyes and dark skin. So
that actually goes down blue eyes

00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:56.620
frequency then was the early
agriculturalists and then spreads again in

00:19:56.620 --> 00:20:02.130
the last few thousand years. And actually
light skin that we have so typically in

00:20:02.130 --> 00:20:07.590
Europe today is in low frequency even in
the early farmers but only starts to

00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:10.330
spread in the Bronze Age. So this
phenotype which is so typical for

00:20:10.330 --> 00:20:14.440
Europeans, this light skin, seems to be
only about 4,000 years old, so actually

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:19.300
quite a recent chapter in our evolution.
What we could also show which was quite

00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:24.460
interesting is the ability to digest milk
during adulthood, so lactase-resistance.

00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:28.650
That's a phenotype that a lot of people
attributed to the early agriculturalists,

00:20:28.650 --> 00:20:32.730
that basically those people that had cows
were for sure then also able to drink a

00:20:32.730 --> 00:20:36.180
lot of milk. But actually the frequency in
those people of this gene is actually

00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:40.610
zero. So they didn't have it. And it only
appears then during the Bronze Age and it

00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:44.160
really spreads only in the last 3,000
years. And we're not even sure when it

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:47.790
happened during antiquity, during the
Medieval time or maybe in the last few

00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:52.670
hundred years. I'd like to end and
summarize that the Neolithic revolution is

00:20:52.670 --> 00:20:56.830
really a diffusion of people, it was
people coming to Europe. Those people

00:20:56.830 --> 00:21:00.920
brought genes, potentially new phenotype,
but they also brought new diseases and

00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:03.950
that's actually quite exciting, quite
interesting the first evidence we have of

00:21:03.950 --> 00:21:08.490
that. What we also can say now is it was
not just one migration, it was not just

00:21:08.490 --> 00:21:11.480
those people from the near East that
brought agriculture, but there was a

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:15.640
second large migration about 5,000 years
ago. Again, we're not really sure why it

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:19.990
was triggered but the introduction of
diseases is one possibility. So with that,

00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:23.710
I'd like to thank a lot of collaboration
partners for the first paper that I

00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:28.490
mentioned, mostly of course David Rice and
his team, but also Svante Paabo and his

00:21:28.490 --> 00:21:32.760
group in Leipzig. The second study I
presented, it was coordinated actually

00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:35.880
with Copenhagen and Adelaide at the time,
now with us and Yena [SP] and also David

00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:40.370
Rice's group. And the third paper talked
about which was again coordinated by David

00:21:40.370 --> 00:21:45.010
Rice and Ian Matterson in Harvard. I'd
like to thank my group, a lot of funding

00:21:45.010 --> 00:21:47.310
bodies. Thank you for your attention,
thank you.
