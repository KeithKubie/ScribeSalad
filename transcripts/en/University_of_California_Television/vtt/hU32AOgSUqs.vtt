00:00:05.401 --> 00:00:08.484
(lively piano music)

00:00:09.517 --> 00:00:12.421
- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape.

00:00:12.421 --> 00:00:13.726
Bipedal.

00:00:13.726 --> 00:00:14.974
Naked

00:00:14.974 --> 00:00:16.141
Large-brained.

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:21.706
Long the master of fire,
tools and language.

00:00:21.706 --> 00:00:25.947
But still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:25.947 --> 00:00:29.287
Aware that death is inevitable.

00:00:29.287 --> 00:00:31.370
Yet filled with optimism.

00:00:32.608 --> 00:00:34.108
We grow up slowly.

00:00:34.955 --> 00:00:37.545
we hand down knowledge.

00:00:37.545 --> 00:00:39.628
We empathize and deceive.

00:00:40.889 --> 00:00:42.092
We shape the future

00:00:42.092 --> 00:00:45.592
from our shared understanding of the past.

00:00:46.475 --> 00:00:48.480
CARTA brings together experts

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.768
from diverse disciplines
to exchange insights

00:00:51.768 --> 00:00:54.601
on who we are and how we got here.

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.038
An exploration made possible

00:00:58.038 --> 00:01:01.121
by the generosity of humans like you.

00:01:15.265 --> 00:01:17.932
(uptempo music)

00:01:20.603 --> 00:01:23.186
(upbeat music)

00:01:39.831 --> 00:01:41.262
So, I'm Rusty Gage.

00:01:41.262 --> 00:01:43.325
I'm the, as she said,

00:01:43.325 --> 00:01:46.626
I'm one of the co-directors with Margaret

00:01:46.626 --> 00:01:48.293
and Ajit and Pascal.

00:01:49.282 --> 00:01:51.942
And one of the co-sponsors of today's

00:01:51.942 --> 00:01:53.942
presentation to you all.

00:01:55.035 --> 00:01:57.222
I'm gonna give you a little bit of a

00:01:57.222 --> 00:02:00.235
explanation for why we're
having this meeting today,

00:02:00.235 --> 00:02:01.918
how we came about

00:02:01.918 --> 00:02:03.501
doing this meeting,

00:02:04.852 --> 00:02:08.057
and I'm also gonna give
you the first of our

00:02:08.057 --> 00:02:11.071
presentations today on my approach

00:02:11.071 --> 00:02:12.916
and take to this.

00:02:12.916 --> 00:02:14.499
So, some of you are

00:02:16.266 --> 00:02:19.440
long time participants in the symposia

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.060
and will be somewhat intimidated

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.379
probably by the title of
this current presentation,

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:27.657
Cellular and Molecular Mechanisms

00:02:27.657 --> 00:02:29.576
that are underlying or the evolving

00:02:29.576 --> 00:02:33.743
the differences between
humans and non-human primates.

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:38.536
So, probing the molecular
cellular differences.

00:02:40.703 --> 00:02:42.211
Remember what Ajit told us,

00:02:42.211 --> 00:02:45.961
he said that our goal
is to really understand

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:47.753
where we came from.

00:02:47.753 --> 00:02:49.261
how did we get here

00:02:49.261 --> 00:02:50.845
and what is the mechanism

00:02:50.845 --> 00:02:54.258
or what is the way in which this happened,

00:02:54.258 --> 00:02:56.841
And in truth most of what we've

00:02:58.526 --> 00:03:01.574
been talking about for many years is

00:03:01.574 --> 00:03:03.771
the ways in which we actually examine this

00:03:03.771 --> 00:03:06.661
is by looking at DNA from

00:03:06.661 --> 00:03:09.794
post-mortem tissue from
our closest relatives,

00:03:09.794 --> 00:03:11.573
even neanderthals now,

00:03:11.573 --> 00:03:14.749
and sequencing that DNA
and comparing with humans

00:03:14.749 --> 00:03:18.224
and looking for the
difference that exists.

00:03:18.224 --> 00:03:19.903
We have post-mortem tissue itself

00:03:19.903 --> 00:03:21.431
where we can look at brain structures

00:03:21.431 --> 00:03:26.237
and see how they may have
changed with evolution,

00:03:26.237 --> 00:03:28.740
anatomical kinds of information.

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:32.080
And of course, at the core of it we have

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.194
archeological evidence for bones

00:03:34.194 --> 00:03:35.914
where we can get brain casts

00:03:35.914 --> 00:03:38.244
and look at how the
brain size has changed,

00:03:38.244 --> 00:03:40.106
and even if you get a good cast

00:03:40.106 --> 00:03:41.727
you can see how certain areas of the brain

00:03:41.727 --> 00:03:43.880
have grown more in different species

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.778
or different evolving creatures over time,

00:03:47.778 --> 00:03:49.921
these endocasts.

00:03:49.921 --> 00:03:53.582
And finally we have archeological evidence

00:03:53.582 --> 00:03:55.582
that gives insights into

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.380
perhaps even the thought
processes that were going on

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.130
while our species were evolving.

00:04:04.969 --> 00:04:07.719
In the case of DNA we have genes.

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:12.940
In the case of the post-mortem
tissue we have tissues

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.023
and slices and histological evidence.

00:04:17.531 --> 00:04:21.689
With bones we have inferences
about size and structure.

00:04:21.689 --> 00:04:25.356
And of course archeological
evidence we have

00:04:26.269 --> 00:04:28.102
cultural implications.

00:04:28.936 --> 00:04:31.487
And so a missing piece
for this for a lot of us

00:04:31.487 --> 00:04:34.923
has been really what we
consider to be mechanisms

00:04:34.923 --> 00:04:39.458
at the level of cellular
and molecular events.

00:04:39.458 --> 00:04:43.541
And there's a growing
interest in this piece here

00:04:45.532 --> 00:04:48.306
and we call it the missing link.

00:04:48.306 --> 00:04:49.864
It's joke just to get the.

00:04:49.864 --> 00:04:52.296
(audience laughs)

00:04:52.296 --> 00:04:54.722
Missing link in the sequence of events

00:04:54.722 --> 00:04:57.889
and there are some recent technologies

00:04:59.044 --> 00:05:01.488
that have been developed
that have allowed us

00:05:01.488 --> 00:05:03.905
to get insights into tissues.

00:05:04.844 --> 00:05:07.441
One is using what you'll hear a bit about

00:05:07.441 --> 00:05:09.499
which is called induced pluripotent cells.

00:05:09.499 --> 00:05:12.479
This is the ability to take somatic cells

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:14.325
from any species

00:05:14.325 --> 00:05:17.635
and convert them into a embryonic cell

00:05:17.635 --> 00:05:20.001
that can be differentiated into

00:05:20.001 --> 00:05:21.967
all cells of the body including neurons.

00:05:21.967 --> 00:05:25.214
So, for living organisms that we normally

00:05:25.214 --> 00:05:27.787
can't penetrate and see
how their brain functions,

00:05:27.787 --> 00:05:31.555
we can now look at behavioral function,

00:05:31.555 --> 00:05:33.042
look at the genes while they're active,

00:05:33.042 --> 00:05:34.666
while they're alive.

00:05:34.666 --> 00:05:37.697
In addition you'll hear a lot about

00:05:37.697 --> 00:05:40.904
model organisms where once
genes have been identified

00:05:40.904 --> 00:05:44.969
that might have implications
for certain growth patterns,

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:46.565
that are unique to humans,

00:05:46.565 --> 00:05:50.894
they can be tested
experimentally in living animals,

00:05:50.894 --> 00:05:53.999
different species that reveal to us

00:05:53.999 --> 00:05:56.007
how that unique change in the gene

00:05:56.007 --> 00:05:58.805
may have fostered a meaningful change

00:05:58.805 --> 00:06:00.351
that is relevant to how it is

00:06:00.351 --> 00:06:02.518
that we became who we are.

00:06:03.511 --> 00:06:04.698
That's the motivation

00:06:04.698 --> 00:06:07.948
and on a personal note I would say that

00:06:09.798 --> 00:06:13.965
my hope is, my hopes are
always mixed with worries,

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:17.793
the worry is not that we develop

00:06:17.793 --> 00:06:19.873
a whole new area of research

00:06:19.873 --> 00:06:23.183
that just looks in towards ourselves

00:06:23.183 --> 00:06:24.449
explaining more and more about

00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:26.300
the cellular molecular mechanisms,

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:30.329
but rather that these
new tools become vehicles

00:06:30.329 --> 00:06:33.638
for expanding outward
into the other panoply

00:06:33.638 --> 00:06:36.971
of ways in which we can study evolution.

00:06:37.978 --> 00:06:39.877
There's an emerging idea now,

00:06:39.877 --> 00:06:43.544
sort of re-emergence
of a concept in science

00:06:45.633 --> 00:06:47.864
called convergent science.

00:06:47.864 --> 00:06:50.447
It was a term that was modified

00:06:53.304 --> 00:06:55.149
from the concept of consilience

00:06:55.149 --> 00:06:57.066
but it is the idea that

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:00.769
different levels of science that normally

00:07:00.769 --> 00:07:03.185
talk specifically to themselves

00:07:03.185 --> 00:07:05.749
begin to understand how they can transmit

00:07:05.749 --> 00:07:08.329
information from one level to a next,

00:07:08.329 --> 00:07:10.702
and that's how we believe or hope

00:07:10.702 --> 00:07:14.341
that new concepts and
deeper thoughts will emerge.

00:07:14.341 --> 00:07:17.209
So, our challenge as most of us

00:07:17.209 --> 00:07:18.596
as cellular molecular biologists

00:07:18.596 --> 00:07:21.547
that are speakers in this symposium

00:07:21.547 --> 00:07:25.505
is to think about how we
can use this information,

00:07:25.505 --> 00:07:28.304
to stretch this and expand
to these other areas

00:07:28.304 --> 00:07:32.322
that are so important for understanding

00:07:32.322 --> 00:07:34.957
the underlying principles.

00:07:34.957 --> 00:07:39.124
All right with that I will
present the first presentation.

00:07:41.039 --> 00:07:43.653
And hopefully this will act a little bit

00:07:43.653 --> 00:07:45.576
as an introduction to the

00:07:45.576 --> 00:07:49.479
concepts that we're trying to present.

00:07:49.479 --> 00:07:53.396
I'm gonna very specifically
talk about modeling

00:07:54.878 --> 00:07:57.878
human evolution remarkably in a dish

00:07:59.585 --> 00:08:03.362
and this involves this
technology I talked to you about

00:08:03.362 --> 00:08:05.090
called induced pluripotent cells

00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:07.840
which I'll go into in some depth.

00:08:09.436 --> 00:08:12.103
Now studying evolution in a dish

00:08:12.967 --> 00:08:15.717
has advantages and disadvantages.

00:08:17.147 --> 00:08:18.921
Comparison between humans,

00:08:18.921 --> 00:08:21.664
what we're really comparing
are these particular cell types

00:08:21.664 --> 00:08:24.325
and not the full organisms.

00:08:24.325 --> 00:08:26.359
But the hope is that

00:08:26.359 --> 00:08:29.550
or the belief is that much
of the critical changes

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:33.260
that have occurred occur in the brain.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:37.427
And that this transition
point from early brain cells

00:08:38.828 --> 00:08:42.078
to mature brain cells is that period of

00:08:43.292 --> 00:08:46.071
maturation within a cell lineage

00:08:46.071 --> 00:08:50.148
wherein much of the
magic happens that will

00:08:50.148 --> 00:08:52.884
be seen as the known
or unknown differences

00:08:52.884 --> 00:08:55.448
between humans and our closest relatives.

00:08:55.448 --> 00:08:57.654
And as you'll hear

00:08:57.654 --> 00:09:00.129
some common themes emerging
from these speakers

00:09:00.129 --> 00:09:02.188
that these early, very early events,

00:09:02.188 --> 00:09:03.644
there's real differences

00:09:03.644 --> 00:09:05.515
that are occurring in human species

00:09:05.515 --> 00:09:08.760
relative to our common relatives.

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:12.977
Now the advantage of this approach is that

00:09:12.977 --> 00:09:16.727
we can obtain somatic
cells or skin biopsies,

00:09:17.950 --> 00:09:20.835
and now this technology can be done with

00:09:20.835 --> 00:09:22.741
pretty much any somatic cell.

00:09:22.741 --> 00:09:26.334
But you can you can obtain
them from many species

00:09:26.334 --> 00:09:29.084
and very non-intervention manner.

00:09:31.998 --> 00:09:34.542
We've been developing
basically a cellular zoo now

00:09:34.542 --> 00:09:37.638
for the last eight or 10
years where we collect

00:09:37.638 --> 00:09:39.471
biopsies from species,

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:42.327
a variety of different species

00:09:42.327 --> 00:09:45.468
and I'll be talking to you about

00:09:45.468 --> 00:09:48.933
these species from human, bonobo, chimp,

00:09:48.933 --> 00:09:50.516
gorilla and rhesus.

00:09:51.572 --> 00:09:55.724
And in particular you should remember that

00:09:55.724 --> 00:09:58.208
the chimps and bonobos share

00:09:58.208 --> 00:10:01.190
significant amount of their genome

00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:04.659
and yet the brain size difference between

00:10:04.659 --> 00:10:07.816
our brains and our closest relatives

00:10:07.816 --> 00:10:09.229
is really quite striking,

00:10:09.229 --> 00:10:10.999
we'll have more about that.

00:10:10.999 --> 00:10:13.092
And other differences are that

00:10:13.092 --> 00:10:16.897
in this last period of seven
million years when we evolved,

00:10:16.897 --> 00:10:19.550
many of the genes, many of the diseases

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:22.289
that have evolved appear
to be unique to humans.

00:10:22.289 --> 00:10:26.188
So, along with the acquisition
of the unique features

00:10:26.188 --> 00:10:29.623
that it is to be human we've
also acquired susceptibility

00:10:29.623 --> 00:10:31.886
to a variety of diseases.

00:10:31.886 --> 00:10:34.703
And so, one of the advantages

00:10:34.703 --> 00:10:36.132
or one of the goals of understanding

00:10:36.132 --> 00:10:38.828
the cellular molecular
underlying mechanisms

00:10:38.828 --> 00:10:42.131
that are involved in
human species evolution

00:10:42.131 --> 00:10:46.298
will tell us about the unique
features of these diseases.

00:10:47.901 --> 00:10:51.192
So in this particular case we've acquired

00:10:51.192 --> 00:10:55.275
pluripotent stem cells
from a variety of species.

00:10:56.574 --> 00:10:57.446
We take the cultures,

00:10:57.446 --> 00:10:59.679
we grow them in dishes

00:10:59.679 --> 00:11:01.965
and we treat them exactly the same.

00:11:01.965 --> 00:11:05.715
And we use a series of
chemical modifications

00:11:06.883 --> 00:11:08.632
and structural modifications

00:11:08.632 --> 00:11:12.178
to change these fibroblasts
into what amounts to

00:11:12.178 --> 00:11:14.544
an embryonic stem cell.

00:11:14.544 --> 00:11:18.036
And this is called induced pluripotency

00:11:18.036 --> 00:11:20.405
and in the end we have a series

00:11:20.405 --> 00:11:22.471
of clonal populations of cells

00:11:22.471 --> 00:11:25.153
that can grow indefinitely.

00:11:25.153 --> 00:11:26.771
And under the right conditions,

00:11:26.771 --> 00:11:30.687
these cells can be induced
to differentiate into neurons

00:11:30.687 --> 00:11:32.640
of a variety of different types.

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:35.240
And it's this ability
to be able to look at

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:36.353
each of the different stages.

00:11:36.353 --> 00:11:40.089
So we can look at the early
stages of somatic cells

00:11:40.089 --> 00:11:42.907
as they're growing in a dish as iPS cells

00:11:42.907 --> 00:11:46.324
or as the intermediates that lead to

00:11:46.324 --> 00:11:49.657
differentiation of different cell types.

00:11:50.572 --> 00:11:52.953
Now obviously there are limitations

00:11:52.953 --> 00:11:56.552
and we should be, we're aware of those.

00:11:56.552 --> 00:11:59.591
We're examining intrinsic differences

00:11:59.591 --> 00:12:02.776
that can be detected in
these individual cells.

00:12:02.776 --> 00:12:06.795
There must be a genetic
or an epigenetic event

00:12:06.795 --> 00:12:09.954
that is underlying any phenotype

00:12:09.954 --> 00:12:12.704
or difference that we can detect.

00:12:13.588 --> 00:12:16.001
Culture, when I say there
are cultural differences

00:12:16.001 --> 00:12:20.420
in this case I mean tissue
culture not advanced culture.

00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:24.139
Social experience is something
that's very difficult to,

00:12:24.139 --> 00:12:27.924
we're not going to capture
that social acquired knowledge.

00:12:27.924 --> 00:12:31.257
Dietary kinds of events are difficult to

00:12:32.439 --> 00:12:34.022
completely capture.

00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:38.098
And of course I'll tell you a
little bit about our attempts

00:12:38.098 --> 00:12:41.841
to get in vivo context by transplantation.

00:12:41.841 --> 00:12:44.662
And it's really question whether or not

00:12:44.662 --> 00:12:48.514
the in vitro relevancy of the
phenotypes that we look at,

00:12:48.514 --> 00:12:50.451
how well do they transfer.

00:12:50.451 --> 00:12:53.621
That takes additional
kinds of experiments.

00:12:53.621 --> 00:12:55.011
But what it really comes down to

00:12:55.011 --> 00:12:57.521
is are there differences
that are detectable

00:12:57.521 --> 00:12:58.934
at the cellular level

00:12:58.934 --> 00:13:02.642
that are relevant to the
understanding of human origins?

00:13:02.642 --> 00:13:04.532
So, there are some basic features

00:13:04.532 --> 00:13:06.613
that we could look at right away

00:13:06.613 --> 00:13:09.499
and we know that for example,

00:13:09.499 --> 00:13:13.249
humans have 46 and chimp
have 48 chromosomes.

00:13:14.912 --> 00:13:18.662
That they express certain
genes that identify

00:13:19.739 --> 00:13:21.968
the most primitive state.

00:13:21.968 --> 00:13:24.108
So we can look for those to make sure that

00:13:24.108 --> 00:13:25.341
when we do the conversion

00:13:25.341 --> 00:13:28.130
they are retained within a certain fate.

00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:31.651
And we can test whether or not these

00:13:31.651 --> 00:13:34.299
embryonic stem cells that we get

00:13:34.299 --> 00:13:37.545
behave equivalently or not equivalent.

00:13:37.545 --> 00:13:39.059
So it's really important
right the very beginning

00:13:39.059 --> 00:13:41.718
to determine whether or not
we're seeing differences or not

00:13:41.718 --> 00:13:44.552
so we can monitor them with a variety

00:13:44.552 --> 00:13:47.058
of known differences.

00:13:47.058 --> 00:13:49.361
So here are some simple ways

00:13:49.361 --> 00:13:51.186
in which we can do this morphologically

00:13:51.186 --> 00:13:54.519
and genetically determine by karyotyping

00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:58.224
the chromosomes that are inherent,

00:13:58.224 --> 00:13:59.491
and whether or not there's any

00:13:59.491 --> 00:14:02.074
gross differences between them.

00:14:02.995 --> 00:14:04.981
Whether or not the cells
grow at the same rate,

00:14:04.981 --> 00:14:07.374
whether or not they
express the same genes.

00:14:07.374 --> 00:14:10.541
And in our first attempts at this now,

00:14:12.295 --> 00:14:14.462
years ago we first started

00:14:16.155 --> 00:14:17.844
by looking at these immature cells,

00:14:17.844 --> 00:14:20.723
these iPS, what they called
induced pluripotent cells

00:14:20.723 --> 00:14:23.324
to see if we could determine
any differences between them.

00:14:23.324 --> 00:14:26.790
And we did this by extracting DNA

00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:28.984
and we looked for the
expression of all the genes

00:14:28.984 --> 00:14:31.287
that were expressed in these cells

00:14:31.287 --> 00:14:32.466
between all the species

00:14:32.466 --> 00:14:33.662
to see whether or not we could find

00:14:33.662 --> 00:14:35.683
any fundamental differences

00:14:35.683 --> 00:14:39.250
that were apparent at that early stage.

00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:42.942
And I won't go through this in any depth

00:14:42.942 --> 00:14:46.017
but back several years ago now

00:14:46.017 --> 00:14:49.010
we reported that there were features

00:14:49.010 --> 00:14:52.258
particularly interesting
to, interest to our lab

00:14:52.258 --> 00:14:54.621
that there are genetic
elements in the brain

00:14:54.621 --> 00:14:57.451
that had this capacity for hopping around

00:14:57.451 --> 00:15:00.266
or jumping from one location to another.

00:15:00.266 --> 00:15:04.811
And these genes were very
differently regulated

00:15:04.811 --> 00:15:08.144
in chimps and bonobos relative to humans

00:15:09.557 --> 00:15:14.244
to the extent that humans
had developed a mechanism

00:15:14.244 --> 00:15:15.817
by expressing two particular genes

00:15:15.817 --> 00:15:18.085
that suppressed the activity
of these line elements.

00:15:18.085 --> 00:15:22.818
So, the amount of new elements
or new genetic material

00:15:22.818 --> 00:15:25.114
that was added into the germ line

00:15:25.114 --> 00:15:27.589
through this particular vehicle
was suppressed in humans

00:15:27.589 --> 00:15:30.922
relative to our closest relative species

00:15:32.464 --> 00:15:36.631
and by virtue of the over
expression of these genes.

00:15:38.214 --> 00:15:41.214
We went on to hypothesize about this

00:15:42.443 --> 00:15:47.248
and have continued working on
these early primitive cells

00:15:47.248 --> 00:15:50.578
exploring this role that
these mobile elements play

00:15:50.578 --> 00:15:54.456
in carving and crafting novel phenotypes

00:15:54.456 --> 00:15:56.696
within not just in the human species

00:15:56.696 --> 00:15:59.476
but in other organism as well.

00:15:59.476 --> 00:16:02.557
One interesting point that I like to make

00:16:02.557 --> 00:16:04.890
is that these line elements,

00:16:06.250 --> 00:16:09.238
these increase in insertions
of these pieces of DNA

00:16:09.238 --> 00:16:10.771
throughout the genome

00:16:10.771 --> 00:16:14.244
add to the genetic
diversity of the offspring.

00:16:14.244 --> 00:16:16.705
And we as humans have
suppressed this ability

00:16:16.705 --> 00:16:19.872
to add this added element of diversity

00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:25.347
which may mean a decrease in
behavioral diversity as well

00:16:28.063 --> 00:16:31.326
limiting our genetic diversity.

00:16:31.326 --> 00:16:35.862
Now this less genetic diversity
leads to a dependence now

00:16:35.862 --> 00:16:38.044
more on cultural change for adaptation

00:16:38.044 --> 00:16:39.704
to changes in the environment.

00:16:39.704 --> 00:16:42.375
And we are exploring this as a hypothesis

00:16:42.375 --> 00:16:46.955
for how humans are quite
similar to each other.

00:16:46.955 --> 00:16:49.184
So what I'm going to
talk to you about today

00:16:49.184 --> 00:16:52.588
is in the next few minutes is about

00:16:52.588 --> 00:16:54.487
newer work looking at the next phase

00:16:54.487 --> 00:16:56.935
of differentiation which are
these neural progenitor cells

00:16:56.935 --> 00:16:59.708
and then subsequently neurons.

00:16:59.708 --> 00:17:02.440
So we've developed a protocol where we can

00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:06.264
generate cells into these very homogeneous

00:17:06.264 --> 00:17:07.593
neural progenitor cells.

00:17:07.593 --> 00:17:10.676
They express very unique and features

00:17:12.919 --> 00:17:15.417
that we can compare across species.

00:17:15.417 --> 00:17:18.216
And there are methodologies
now that allow us to

00:17:18.216 --> 00:17:19.914
use unbiased methods to measure

00:17:19.914 --> 00:17:21.569
all the genetic expression

00:17:21.569 --> 00:17:23.613
that's unique to these cells

00:17:23.613 --> 00:17:26.346
and compare them with one another.

00:17:26.346 --> 00:17:29.224
When we do this across all the
species that we've looked at

00:17:29.224 --> 00:17:32.729
from chimps, bonobos, gorillas
and rhesus versus humans,

00:17:32.729 --> 00:17:35.855
we see 2,000 genes that are
differentially expressed

00:17:35.855 --> 00:17:37.654
at a very, very high level.

00:17:37.654 --> 00:17:39.947
And among them when we
look at clusters of genes

00:17:39.947 --> 00:17:43.436
that have categories in
common called gene ontology,

00:17:43.436 --> 00:17:45.975
we find that about a quarter of those

00:17:45.975 --> 00:17:49.185
are genes that are involved
in how cells migrate

00:17:49.185 --> 00:17:51.006
within a tissue situation.

00:17:51.006 --> 00:17:53.493
So migration, the movement of neurons.

00:17:53.493 --> 00:17:57.134
This seems to be a
feature that stands out.

00:17:57.134 --> 00:17:59.257
So we set up an assay system to measure

00:17:59.257 --> 00:18:02.019
whether or not we could
detect that genetic difference

00:18:02.019 --> 00:18:04.402
in a functional difference.

00:18:04.402 --> 00:18:05.818
This is an assay where the cells

00:18:05.818 --> 00:18:07.704
are plated on a culture dish

00:18:07.704 --> 00:18:10.459
and then we make a cut here

00:18:10.459 --> 00:18:13.151
and then we ask how
quickly they can migrate

00:18:13.151 --> 00:18:14.564
into their situation.

00:18:14.564 --> 00:18:16.398
And we can monitor the cells

00:18:16.398 --> 00:18:18.987
as they grow into this

00:18:18.987 --> 00:18:22.009
and we can color them and
do this in a much more

00:18:22.009 --> 00:18:25.153
high resolution where
we can track each cell

00:18:25.153 --> 00:18:27.752
and look at the direction that it goes.

00:18:27.752 --> 00:18:30.757
When we do this across multiple species

00:18:30.757 --> 00:18:33.456
we find that humans are much slower

00:18:33.456 --> 00:18:34.688
in their migratory pathway.

00:18:34.688 --> 00:18:37.688
So by 24 hours this pathway is fully

00:18:38.548 --> 00:18:41.631
aggregated together within migration.

00:18:43.159 --> 00:18:45.627
Just as another example we can

00:18:45.627 --> 00:18:46.804
look at this in another way,

00:18:46.804 --> 00:18:51.048
looking at migration again
as a feature of these cells.

00:18:51.048 --> 00:18:54.200
We can label the chimp cells in green,

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:56.801
sorry, in red and the human cells in green

00:18:56.801 --> 00:18:58.043
and then mix them together

00:18:58.043 --> 00:19:00.460
and put them at the bottom of

00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:04.106
a dish that has micro grooves

00:19:04.106 --> 00:19:06.675
where we can monitor and has a gradient

00:19:06.675 --> 00:19:09.591
where we can monitor rate
at which the cells grow.

00:19:09.591 --> 00:19:11.851
And this allows us to actually race

00:19:11.851 --> 00:19:15.036
our two cells against each other

00:19:15.036 --> 00:19:17.786
and see who can get there faster.

00:19:18.939 --> 00:19:21.502
We can track again so it's
another method of this I think.

00:19:21.502 --> 00:19:24.481
So, here we have and it really
depends on when the cells

00:19:24.481 --> 00:19:26.279
get into the groove

00:19:26.279 --> 00:19:27.587
and then you can start monitoring

00:19:27.587 --> 00:19:28.513
how quickly they move.

00:19:28.513 --> 00:19:31.276
So here's the green cells of the human

00:19:31.276 --> 00:19:33.040
moving along the groove,
these are the grooves

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:33.873
that they're in here.

00:19:33.873 --> 00:19:35.549
We're watching this cell move along.

00:19:35.549 --> 00:19:38.402
Finally we get a a chimp cell in there

00:19:38.402 --> 00:19:41.388
and the chimp cell sort
of takes off and moves.

00:19:41.388 --> 00:19:45.231
Again evidence, another way
in which we can begin to

00:19:45.231 --> 00:19:47.201
monitor these differences.

00:19:47.201 --> 00:19:49.514
And when we do thousands of these movies

00:19:49.514 --> 00:19:51.720
we see that both chimp and bonobo

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:54.164
are really quite similar in their rate

00:19:54.164 --> 00:19:56.243
and direction of trajectory

00:19:56.243 --> 00:20:00.447
as compared to the human which
appears to be much slower.

00:20:00.447 --> 00:20:04.982
In a final assay here we did
a floating assay of cells

00:20:04.982 --> 00:20:08.763
that migrate out from the central core

00:20:08.763 --> 00:20:10.905
and we can measure the core of the cells

00:20:10.905 --> 00:20:12.694
and the distance that they migrate.

00:20:12.694 --> 00:20:17.325
And without much effort you
can see that the human cells

00:20:17.325 --> 00:20:20.084
while plated to the
same density migrate out

00:20:20.084 --> 00:20:22.085
over a period of time
at a much slower rate

00:20:22.085 --> 00:20:24.816
relative to the other cells.

00:20:24.816 --> 00:20:28.118
Now as a final assay
for this migration assay

00:20:28.118 --> 00:20:31.399
we took advantage of the
fact we had colored cells

00:20:31.399 --> 00:20:34.316
and we transplanted them into a mouse

00:20:34.316 --> 00:20:36.819
that had a deleted immune system.

00:20:36.819 --> 00:20:38.969
So it didn't recognize
the species difference

00:20:38.969 --> 00:20:42.118
between humans and chimps versus itself.

00:20:42.118 --> 00:20:44.539
So we could transplant
these cells directly

00:20:44.539 --> 00:20:46.661
into the brain in various regions

00:20:46.661 --> 00:20:50.476
and monitor the rate in
which they were migrating.

00:20:50.476 --> 00:20:53.590
And I should say those people
who work in this field know

00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:56.459
that human cells when implanted

00:20:56.459 --> 00:20:58.564
tend to aggregate very closely.

00:20:58.564 --> 00:21:00.836
So we weren't really
anticipating a difference

00:21:00.836 --> 00:21:02.690
but it's really quite striking

00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:05.101
when we examine these cells

00:21:05.101 --> 00:21:07.377
months after the transplantation,

00:21:07.377 --> 00:21:09.294
we see that there is or

00:21:10.241 --> 00:21:13.471
but was noticed even as soon
as several weeks afterwards

00:21:13.471 --> 00:21:15.972
that the human cells here aggregated

00:21:15.972 --> 00:21:17.266
around the site of the injection,

00:21:17.266 --> 00:21:20.890
whereas the chimp cells
migrated at a much greater rate.

00:21:20.890 --> 00:21:22.978
And we could replicate this

00:21:22.978 --> 00:21:26.397
or we could quantify
this very dramatically.

00:21:26.397 --> 00:21:28.564
So we know now that human,

00:21:29.881 --> 00:21:31.644
with all these assays put together

00:21:31.644 --> 00:21:34.048
we can convince ourselves
that there really is this

00:21:34.048 --> 00:21:36.860
intrinsic migration
deference which reflected

00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:40.584
in the gene differences that
we can see between them.

00:21:40.584 --> 00:21:42.372
Now that we can transplant these cells

00:21:42.372 --> 00:21:46.013
we can watch their maturation into cells

00:21:46.013 --> 00:21:48.718
and the sort of morphological changes

00:21:48.718 --> 00:21:51.319
that happens to a neuron as it matures

00:21:51.319 --> 00:21:54.902
is something that's
really well-documented.

00:21:55.754 --> 00:21:59.667
And with a wonderful collaboration with

00:21:59.667 --> 00:22:02.718
Katerina Semendeferi we were able to

00:22:02.718 --> 00:22:04.898
and Bianca, our student, we were able to

00:22:04.898 --> 00:22:07.288
monitor these changes in vivo

00:22:07.288 --> 00:22:08.867
between chimp and human.

00:22:08.867 --> 00:22:11.751
And the advantage is that
we're mixing the cells together

00:22:11.751 --> 00:22:13.304
and injecting in the exact site

00:22:13.304 --> 00:22:16.050
and can monitor them as they migrate away,

00:22:16.050 --> 00:22:19.011
and then look at them over a period of,

00:22:19.011 --> 00:22:22.642
in this case something like 19 or 19 weeks

00:22:22.642 --> 00:22:25.718
and we're looking at a variety
of morphological features.

00:22:25.718 --> 00:22:28.340
And strikingly, what we can do

00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:32.632
is we can map each
individual dual cell in brain

00:22:32.632 --> 00:22:35.781
and look how it morphologically develops.

00:22:35.781 --> 00:22:38.221
So we can see them over
extended periods of time

00:22:38.221 --> 00:22:40.434
and they're color coded
for us in the brain

00:22:40.434 --> 00:22:43.340
so we can see what they, how they change.

00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:46.175
Here you can see if we
look at dendritic length

00:22:46.175 --> 00:22:47.980
they're pretty much the same

00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:50.845
matching the same at these early stages.

00:22:50.845 --> 00:22:53.517
And then humans dramatically take off

00:22:53.517 --> 00:22:55.353
around six to eight weeks.

00:22:55.353 --> 00:22:56.882
And another time we look at segments,

00:22:56.882 --> 00:22:58.782
that's the number of branches they have

00:22:58.782 --> 00:23:00.898
also separates at that period.

00:23:00.898 --> 00:23:03.983
And then finally we have
the number of spines,

00:23:03.983 --> 00:23:06.170
so these are the features
on each one of the dendrites

00:23:06.170 --> 00:23:09.661
where connections are
coming into the cells.

00:23:09.661 --> 00:23:11.926
So we see an accelerated differentiation

00:23:11.926 --> 00:23:15.706
of the neural progenitor cells over time.

00:23:15.706 --> 00:23:17.634
So as a final piece what we did

00:23:17.634 --> 00:23:19.250
is there a functional consequence?

00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:21.610
So we can measure actually
the electrical activity

00:23:21.610 --> 00:23:23.527
whether or not they fire action potentials

00:23:23.527 --> 00:23:25.012
in individual cells

00:23:25.012 --> 00:23:27.915
and in these new devices
called a multi electrode array

00:23:27.915 --> 00:23:30.550
we can plate the cells
and then bring them back

00:23:30.550 --> 00:23:32.208
to the array and monitor their activity,

00:23:32.208 --> 00:23:35.578
how they communicate with each
other over a period of time.

00:23:35.578 --> 00:23:38.359
So they're resting on the
top of these electrodes

00:23:38.359 --> 00:23:41.262
and we can measure their activity.

00:23:41.262 --> 00:23:42.353
The system actually allows us

00:23:42.353 --> 00:23:44.117
to monitor a variety of features.

00:23:44.117 --> 00:23:46.464
We can measure not just the single spikes

00:23:46.464 --> 00:23:49.543
but we can measure issues like bursting.

00:23:49.543 --> 00:23:50.919
Whether or not they fire and bursts

00:23:50.919 --> 00:23:53.258
or they, whether or not all,

00:23:53.258 --> 00:23:54.681
many cells that are
connected with each other

00:23:54.681 --> 00:23:56.514
fire at the same time.

00:23:57.515 --> 00:23:59.756
So finally in this last
piece of information

00:23:59.756 --> 00:24:02.149
I'll give you this final data.

00:24:02.149 --> 00:24:04.218
The way you read this here at two weeks

00:24:04.218 --> 00:24:07.070
each one of these is a
channel on which cells exist.

00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:08.654
So here's the human cell.

00:24:08.654 --> 00:24:12.381
We have a few of them, few
cells in there that are active

00:24:12.381 --> 00:24:16.548
but clearly at two weeks the
chimp and the bonobo are both,

00:24:17.402 --> 00:24:19.273
many many more cells are active

00:24:19.273 --> 00:24:21.039
and not only that but you're
seeing some synchrony.

00:24:21.039 --> 00:24:25.310
Meaning that cells are actually
connected to each other.

00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:28.855
But by eight weeks, six weeks
here you have the humans now

00:24:28.855 --> 00:24:32.744
bursting and synchronized
activity at a much higher rate

00:24:32.744 --> 00:24:35.827
than the chimps evidencing once again

00:24:36.682 --> 00:24:39.581
that there's this early
event where the chimps are

00:24:39.581 --> 00:24:43.676
and the bonobos seem to be
maturing an accelerated rate

00:24:43.676 --> 00:24:45.270
relative to the humans.

00:24:45.270 --> 00:24:47.252
And we see this reflected not just

00:24:47.252 --> 00:24:50.465
in the physiology here, the
chimps extending quickly

00:24:50.465 --> 00:24:52.318
and then being bypassed there.

00:24:52.318 --> 00:24:55.061
And again we have this window of time.

00:24:55.061 --> 00:24:57.167
And the way we're beginning
to think about this

00:24:57.167 --> 00:25:00.782
and I think it's consistent
with many, many others

00:25:00.782 --> 00:25:02.143
is that in human evolution

00:25:02.143 --> 00:25:04.643
there's a developmental delay,

00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:08.955
retardation is not a really good word,

00:25:08.955 --> 00:25:12.104
and/or what has been termed as neoteny

00:25:12.104 --> 00:25:13.896
and in this case it doesn't fit exactly

00:25:13.896 --> 00:25:15.803
because we're not looking at the endpoint,

00:25:15.803 --> 00:25:19.220
but it is a developmental delay in humans

00:25:20.492 --> 00:25:22.884
in their maturation that's been proposed

00:25:22.884 --> 00:25:25.962
as a possible mechanism that
contributes to the rise of

00:25:25.962 --> 00:25:27.671
many human species specific

00:25:27.671 --> 00:25:29.651
including the increase in brain size

00:25:29.651 --> 00:25:32.663
and the emergence of
human-specific cognitive traits.

00:25:32.663 --> 00:25:35.580
So, we and others are interested in

00:25:36.977 --> 00:25:40.501
this delay feature and
how this delay feature

00:25:40.501 --> 00:25:43.759
may result in these morphological

00:25:43.759 --> 00:25:45.234
and genetic features that we see.

00:25:45.234 --> 00:25:47.653
And we'll be talking
more about the mechanisms

00:25:47.653 --> 00:25:50.531
that may control this
sort of delayed event

00:25:50.531 --> 00:25:54.100
which is so important for human evolution.

00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:57.286
So conclusion, I hope
I've tried to convince you

00:25:57.286 --> 00:26:00.518
that the iPS cell approach is,

00:26:00.518 --> 00:26:04.411
we're able to generate
similar type cells in humans

00:26:04.411 --> 00:26:05.725
and in non-human primates.

00:26:05.725 --> 00:26:08.623
And there's a significant
amount of similarity

00:26:08.623 --> 00:26:11.897
that underlies their maturation.

00:26:11.897 --> 00:26:15.730
But we also discover
unique features that are,

00:26:16.841 --> 00:26:18.976
now this is important, cell intrinsic

00:26:18.976 --> 00:26:22.333
or the cell autonomous that
we can detect in vitro.

00:26:22.333 --> 00:26:25.968
And this consistent feature reflects this

00:26:25.968 --> 00:26:27.748
in the migration of the cells,

00:26:27.748 --> 00:26:29.531
in the maturation of the dendrites

00:26:29.531 --> 00:26:32.465
as well as its
electrophysiological activity.

00:26:32.465 --> 00:26:36.873
So we think that these
approaches can be used

00:26:36.873 --> 00:26:38.757
as a model to study the dynamic

00:26:38.757 --> 00:26:40.679
developmental comparative differences

00:26:40.679 --> 00:26:43.703
between humans and primates,

00:26:43.703 --> 00:26:44.802
and non-human primates,

00:26:44.802 --> 00:26:47.008
and the differences that this has

00:26:47.008 --> 00:26:49.591
on an evolutionary perspective.

00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:53.386
So as usual we have many people to thank.

00:26:53.386 --> 00:26:56.005
A lot of that sort of
leader of this project

00:26:56.005 --> 00:26:58.030
who's unfortunately was not able to attend

00:26:58.030 --> 00:26:59.613
is Carol Marchetto.

00:27:00.479 --> 00:27:02.927
A variety of people in
my own lab that have

00:27:02.927 --> 00:27:04.679
more recently played a role in

00:27:04.679 --> 00:27:07.506
various aspects of the analysis.

00:27:07.506 --> 00:27:10.423
But Katerina Semendeferi and Branka

00:27:12.287 --> 00:27:16.730
have been key players in
this morphological analysis

00:27:16.730 --> 00:27:19.151
that they are experts at.

00:27:19.151 --> 00:27:21.937
I have a variety of people
in our local CARTA group

00:27:21.937 --> 00:27:23.247
that are important

00:27:23.247 --> 00:27:25.893
and my close colleague Alysson Muotri

00:27:25.893 --> 00:27:27.756
who's been with us on the beginnings,

00:27:27.756 --> 00:27:30.131
right from the beginnings on this work.

00:27:30.131 --> 00:27:32.662
And with that I want to
thank you for your attention.

00:27:32.662 --> 00:27:35.834
(audience applauding)

00:27:35.834 --> 00:27:37.351
Like many people here and

00:27:37.351 --> 00:27:39.528
ever since I was a graduate
student at David Nelson's lab.

00:27:39.528 --> 00:27:42.196
I've been interested in
the genetic basis of this

00:27:42.196 --> 00:27:44.000
which is what makes the human brain

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.738
so unique compared to our most closest

00:27:45.738 --> 00:27:48.457
related living relatives.

00:27:48.457 --> 00:27:50.389
And I would argue that

00:27:50.389 --> 00:27:51.496
and has already been alluded to

00:27:51.496 --> 00:27:54.636
that geneticist have had
a problem for a long time

00:27:54.636 --> 00:27:57.192
and this is partly
recognized by Allan Wilson

00:27:57.192 --> 00:27:59.449
and Mary-Claire King is that the genomes

00:27:59.449 --> 00:28:03.371
of humans and chimps are thought
to be virtually identical

00:28:03.371 --> 00:28:06.944
but 1.1%, 1.2% genetic difference.

00:28:06.944 --> 00:28:08.401
And I already alluded to that in fact

00:28:08.401 --> 00:28:11.048
that the amino acid level of the proteins

00:28:11.048 --> 00:28:12.195
they estimated half,

00:28:12.195 --> 00:28:14.379
the number is closer to
about a third of the proteins

00:28:14.379 --> 00:28:17.465
are identical between
the chimp and the human.

00:28:17.465 --> 00:28:19.463
Yet when you compare
it to other organisms,

00:28:19.463 --> 00:28:21.804
Drosophila you can compare to amphibians

00:28:21.804 --> 00:28:24.247
even lizards that were
compared at that time

00:28:24.247 --> 00:28:26.101
that Mary-Claire King was working on,

00:28:26.101 --> 00:28:28.279
there are species that
have way more difference

00:28:28.279 --> 00:28:29.734
in their amino acid compositions

00:28:29.734 --> 00:28:33.929
and yet look virtually identical
in behavior and morphology.

00:28:33.929 --> 00:28:36.120
And so this led to kind
of the speculation that

00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:40.348
it must be regulatory changes
that make humans unique

00:28:40.348 --> 00:28:42.986
or structural changes that
are actually important

00:28:42.986 --> 00:28:44.588
in terms of shaping our DNA

00:28:44.588 --> 00:28:46.379
in ways that couldn't be detected

00:28:46.379 --> 00:28:50.128
at the level of amino acid differences.

00:28:50.128 --> 00:28:51.972
So, I've been interested in

00:28:51.972 --> 00:28:55.344
one very specific type of
mutation for a very long time,

00:28:55.344 --> 00:28:57.117
duplicated sequences.

00:28:57.117 --> 00:28:59.643
You might not think of
duplicated sequences as mutations

00:28:59.643 --> 00:29:00.476
but they are.

00:29:00.476 --> 00:29:02.879
They arise as everything
else as a mutation.

00:29:02.879 --> 00:29:05.799
The initial duplication
is a mutational event.

00:29:05.799 --> 00:29:07.204
They're important for genomes

00:29:07.204 --> 00:29:09.714
for two very fundamental reasons.

00:29:09.714 --> 00:29:12.017
Recognized for many years long before

00:29:12.017 --> 00:29:14.996
molecular biology was even a word.

00:29:14.996 --> 00:29:16.487
Susumu Ohno recognized this

00:29:16.487 --> 00:29:18.277
and even before him others did,

00:29:18.277 --> 00:29:20.452
that duplications are the primary force

00:29:20.452 --> 00:29:22.985
by which new genes are
born within species.

00:29:22.985 --> 00:29:25.433
Doesn't matter if you're a
chimp or a fly or a worm,

00:29:25.433 --> 00:29:26.700
if you want to create a new gene

00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:28.968
there's ways to do it that
and don't involve duplication

00:29:28.968 --> 00:29:31.263
but the primary way is
to make an extra copy,

00:29:31.263 --> 00:29:32.756
free it from a selective constraint,

00:29:32.756 --> 00:29:35.545
new mutations occur, new function.

00:29:35.545 --> 00:29:38.129
The second actually goes back earlier

00:29:38.129 --> 00:29:40.882
from guys named Sturtevant
and Bridges and Muller

00:29:40.882 --> 00:29:43.709
back into the 1930s is this idea that

00:29:43.709 --> 00:29:45.364
when you duplicate sequence

00:29:45.364 --> 00:29:48.247
and you create two sequences
that are virtually identical,

00:29:48.247 --> 00:29:51.013
you've actually made the genome unstable.

00:29:51.013 --> 00:29:52.976
So there's a process called
unequal crossing over

00:29:52.976 --> 00:29:55.674
that can lead to unequal
crossing over events

00:29:55.674 --> 00:29:57.563
that leads to gains and losses of sequence

00:29:57.563 --> 00:29:59.886
right where the duplications live.

00:29:59.886 --> 00:30:02.082
So, structurally dynamic

00:30:02.082 --> 00:30:05.492
and the potential to
give birth to new genes.

00:30:05.492 --> 00:30:07.334
I'm gonna to talk to you
a little bit today about

00:30:07.334 --> 00:30:09.568
duplications, recent duplications,

00:30:09.568 --> 00:30:11.684
things that have evolved over
the last 25 million years.

00:30:11.684 --> 00:30:14.031
We call them segmental duplications.

00:30:14.031 --> 00:30:16.352
They'll be duplications
within a chromosome.

00:30:16.352 --> 00:30:18.247
They're interchromosomal duplications

00:30:18.247 --> 00:30:21.038
and duplications within a
chromosome which we'll call

00:30:21.038 --> 00:30:23.083
intrachromosomal duplications.

00:30:23.083 --> 00:30:24.818
And here's a map that I've often showed.

00:30:24.818 --> 00:30:26.272
This is some of the early work that we did

00:30:26.272 --> 00:30:28.100
as part of the genome project

00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:29.143
where we actually built the first

00:30:29.143 --> 00:30:31.480
duplication map of the human genome.

00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:33.280
So anything that you see here in blue

00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:35.495
is an intrachromosomal duplication.

00:30:35.495 --> 00:30:38.078
So that means it's duplicated
along the chromosome.

00:30:38.078 --> 00:30:41.012
These are your chromosomes
schematically represented.

00:30:41.012 --> 00:30:42.820
The purple represent
the regions that still

00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:44.379
to this day haven't been sequenced

00:30:44.379 --> 00:30:46.509
despite what people claim
that the genome is finished.

00:30:46.509 --> 00:30:48.649
These are centromeres and acrocentric

00:30:48.649 --> 00:30:52.215
and some telomeric portions
of the chromosomes.

00:30:52.215 --> 00:30:55.334
The blue all represent the
intrachromosomal duplications

00:30:55.334 --> 00:30:57.802
that are greater than 95% identical

00:30:57.802 --> 00:30:59.971
and get greater than 10 kilobases in size.

00:30:59.971 --> 00:31:02.994
So these are the biggest
events in our genome.

00:31:02.994 --> 00:31:04.964
A couple things I want
you to get from this.

00:31:04.964 --> 00:31:05.901
You can run the statistics

00:31:05.901 --> 00:31:07.023
but you can see it by eye

00:31:07.023 --> 00:31:09.455
that this distribution
is highly non-random.

00:31:09.455 --> 00:31:13.044
Certain chromosomes,
chromosome seven, 15, 16

00:31:13.044 --> 00:31:15.544
are particularly rich in this.

00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:17.974
The second point I want
you to get from this

00:31:17.974 --> 00:31:19.830
is that if you look at the pattern,

00:31:19.830 --> 00:31:21.860
you see that a lot of these
lines actually go over

00:31:21.860 --> 00:31:24.230
what appears to be long distances.

00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:26.856
This is called an interspersed
pattern of duplications.

00:31:26.856 --> 00:31:29.233
That means duplications are born

00:31:29.233 --> 00:31:30.564
but when they are born they don't actually

00:31:30.564 --> 00:31:32.320
stay close to one another but they in fact

00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:34.603
distribute dispersed
from each one one another

00:31:34.603 --> 00:31:36.727
by long distances.

00:31:36.727 --> 00:31:38.907
In fact, if you do this
measurement and ask the question,

00:31:38.907 --> 00:31:41.524
what fraction of our duplicated sequences

00:31:41.524 --> 00:31:43.781
are actually separated from their ancestor

00:31:43.781 --> 00:31:45.440
by at least a megabase,

00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:47.759
are located on completely
different chromosomes?

00:31:47.759 --> 00:31:50.054
And now there is something like 60%.

00:31:50.054 --> 00:31:53.608
So this is your interchromosomal
pattern overlaid.

00:31:53.608 --> 00:31:55.499
This is actually highly non-random as well

00:31:55.499 --> 00:31:58.459
but it's non-random in terms
of regions of the genomes,

00:31:58.459 --> 00:32:00.040
so near the ends of chromosomes

00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:02.094
and near the centromeres are where those

00:32:02.094 --> 00:32:04.404
predominantly live.

00:32:04.404 --> 00:32:07.214
All right, so that's the pattern.

00:32:07.214 --> 00:32:09.062
Why should you care?

00:32:09.062 --> 00:32:10.621
Well the fact that you have interspersed

00:32:10.621 --> 00:32:12.264
duplications in your genome

00:32:12.264 --> 00:32:15.736
that are separated by
sometimes dozens if not

00:32:15.736 --> 00:32:17.340
many dozens of genes,

00:32:17.340 --> 00:32:18.745
means that the genes that live

00:32:18.745 --> 00:32:20.320
between those duplicated sequences

00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:23.237
are prone to be deleted
or duplicated themselves

00:32:23.237 --> 00:32:24.843
because they are now inside a region

00:32:24.843 --> 00:32:27.407
of instability in our genome.

00:32:27.407 --> 00:32:28.843
And I'm not going to go into great detail

00:32:28.843 --> 00:32:31.473
but there are now about
40 different genomic,

00:32:31.473 --> 00:32:34.425
what is called these disorders
of which half of them

00:32:34.425 --> 00:32:37.052
are mediated by recurrent
deletions primarily

00:32:37.052 --> 00:32:40.058
but sometimes duplications
of the sequences

00:32:40.058 --> 00:32:41.864
that are these recently evolved

00:32:41.864 --> 00:32:44.104
duplicated parts of our genome.

00:32:44.104 --> 00:32:45.734
So this is an example of
one that we discovered,

00:32:45.734 --> 00:32:47.237
it's called the, with the others,

00:32:47.237 --> 00:32:49.085
we discovered this back to back to back.

00:32:49.085 --> 00:32:50.768
The Koolen-de Vries syndrome.

00:32:50.768 --> 00:32:52.827
These kids have this region of the genome

00:32:52.827 --> 00:32:54.449
only about a half a million base pairs

00:32:54.449 --> 00:32:56.039
but it's deleted.

00:32:56.039 --> 00:32:59.290
And so they are, parents have
two copies of chromosome 17

00:32:59.290 --> 00:33:01.854
but the child has inherited
one that actually is missing

00:33:01.854 --> 00:33:03.980
about 500 kilobases of sequence,

00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:05.950
and that's because there are human

00:33:05.950 --> 00:33:07.533
or great ape-specific duplications

00:33:07.533 --> 00:33:10.767
located at the boundaries
of this sequence.

00:33:10.767 --> 00:33:12.724
Here's another one that
we discovered in 2008.

00:33:12.724 --> 00:33:15.222
This is a very specific form of autism.

00:33:15.222 --> 00:33:17.728
These children are born with
the exact same kind of problem,

00:33:17.728 --> 00:33:19.210
it's of a different portion of the genome

00:33:19.210 --> 00:33:21.229
where there's duplications
that live right here

00:33:21.229 --> 00:33:23.593
that caused this piece
of DNA to be deleted.

00:33:23.593 --> 00:33:25.853
About three megabases of sequence

00:33:25.853 --> 00:33:27.605
and about a dozen genes.

00:33:27.605 --> 00:33:29.136
Every kid that's been born

00:33:29.136 --> 00:33:30.631
that we've identified at least thus far

00:33:30.631 --> 00:33:32.358
has a form of autism characteristics

00:33:32.358 --> 00:33:34.262
by this frontal bossing of the forehead.

00:33:34.262 --> 00:33:35.864
Very characteristic facial feature.

00:33:35.864 --> 00:33:38.982
So it's a very rare form of
autism in the human species

00:33:38.982 --> 00:33:42.374
caused by this duplication architecture.

00:33:42.374 --> 00:33:43.517
This is an example of one

00:33:43.517 --> 00:33:47.340
which doesn't actually have
any clear facial morphology.

00:33:47.340 --> 00:33:48.845
This is a recurrent micro deletion

00:33:48.845 --> 00:33:50.422
on again chromosome 15

00:33:50.422 --> 00:33:53.806
once again meted by recently
evolved duplicated sequences.

00:33:53.806 --> 00:33:57.736
These kids can either receive
kind of an inherited form

00:33:57.736 --> 00:33:59.264
but more often they get a de novo

00:33:59.264 --> 00:34:00.737
which means that it
happened in a germ line

00:34:00.737 --> 00:34:02.547
of one of their parents.

00:34:02.547 --> 00:34:04.184
Instead of just having one disease

00:34:04.184 --> 00:34:06.695
these kids are at risk
for multiple diseases.

00:34:06.695 --> 00:34:07.984
So it turns out that we identified

00:34:07.984 --> 00:34:09.737
this associate with
intellectual disability

00:34:09.737 --> 00:34:11.629
but relatively high functioning.

00:34:11.629 --> 00:34:13.939
Later it was found to be
associate with autism.

00:34:13.939 --> 00:34:17.298
Later it was found to be
associated 1% of epilepsy,

00:34:17.298 --> 00:34:19.319
so idiopathic generalized epilepsy.

00:34:19.319 --> 00:34:20.423
And papers from other labs

00:34:20.423 --> 00:34:22.193
showed that it was an
important risk factor,

00:34:22.193 --> 00:34:24.550
probably one of the biggest
ones for schizophrenia

00:34:24.550 --> 00:34:26.898
in the adult population.

00:34:26.898 --> 00:34:30.050
All right so, this is our
duplication architecture

00:34:30.050 --> 00:34:31.768
and you could ask yourselves the question,

00:34:31.768 --> 00:34:34.466
well, why do we have this organization?

00:34:34.466 --> 00:34:36.792
It turns out when we go
to the genomes of mouse,

00:34:36.792 --> 00:34:39.085
rats, dogs, cats, platypus

00:34:39.085 --> 00:34:41.297
they don't have this type of organization.

00:34:41.297 --> 00:34:43.952
They keep their duplications
organized in clusters

00:34:43.952 --> 00:34:46.436
and little pockets
without being dispersed.

00:34:46.436 --> 00:34:48.632
So this dispersal of
duplications has created

00:34:48.632 --> 00:34:51.488
a bad design, pardon the pun.

00:34:51.488 --> 00:34:53.863
It actually makes our
genome fragile essentially

00:34:53.863 --> 00:34:56.059
because of the presence of
these duplicate sequences

00:34:56.059 --> 00:34:57.794
that have evolved over the last

00:34:57.794 --> 00:35:00.664
15, 20 million years of evolution.

00:35:00.664 --> 00:35:03.733
Humans, chimps, gorillas,
we all share this

00:35:03.733 --> 00:35:05.543
although the exact patterns are different

00:35:05.543 --> 00:35:07.142
between chimps and gorillas.

00:35:07.142 --> 00:35:10.087
And to a lesser extent
species like macaque

00:35:10.087 --> 00:35:13.317
and marmoset have fewer
of these compared to

00:35:13.317 --> 00:35:15.169
that of the great apes.

00:35:15.169 --> 00:35:17.813
So, I'll say the answer, I
won't give you the answer

00:35:17.813 --> 00:35:20.062
but you've actually
heard some of us today.

00:35:20.062 --> 00:35:23.274
But just remember that
these are not basically gene

00:35:23.274 --> 00:35:24.694
or regions of the genome.

00:35:24.694 --> 00:35:26.757
There's about a thousand genes

00:35:26.757 --> 00:35:28.914
and if you believe your
browsers that are out there

00:35:28.914 --> 00:35:32.291
that aren't mapped in
these areas of the genome.

00:35:32.291 --> 00:35:34.297
And Ohno argued that
this is a primary force

00:35:34.297 --> 00:35:37.492
by which these new genes
evolve as duplication.

00:35:37.492 --> 00:35:40.302
So before I tell you some stories,

00:35:40.302 --> 00:35:41.816
I want to tell you a couple other features

00:35:41.816 --> 00:35:43.193
of these duplications.

00:35:43.193 --> 00:35:45.711
One is that their accumulation over time

00:35:45.711 --> 00:35:48.113
has been non-random.

00:35:48.113 --> 00:35:50.002
So work that was alluded to,

00:35:50.002 --> 00:35:52.595
a work that I did with my
former postdoc, Tomas Marques.

00:35:52.595 --> 00:35:54.419
We sequenced about 100 great ape genomes

00:35:54.419 --> 00:35:57.319
to try to estimate which
duplications were fixed,

00:35:57.319 --> 00:36:00.063
which duplications were polymorphic.

00:36:00.063 --> 00:36:02.628
And there's generally accepted phylogeny

00:36:02.628 --> 00:36:04.385
and the thickness of the lines

00:36:04.385 --> 00:36:07.613
indicate roughly the proportion of

00:36:07.613 --> 00:36:11.241
duplicated sequence that has
been fixed on any branch.

00:36:11.241 --> 00:36:12.823
So the numbers are not that important

00:36:12.823 --> 00:36:14.479
but for those of you were interested

00:36:14.479 --> 00:36:16.856
what this means is for every
base that has been fixed

00:36:16.856 --> 00:36:19.032
as a result of single base pair mutation

00:36:19.032 --> 00:36:21.157
there have been 2.61 bases

00:36:21.157 --> 00:36:22.688
that have been fixed in this branch

00:36:22.688 --> 00:36:24.837
as a result of duplication.

00:36:24.837 --> 00:36:25.989
But the really important

00:36:25.989 --> 00:36:29.614
and I think relevant to
this audience is that

00:36:29.614 --> 00:36:32.395
there is a huge excess, very statistical

00:36:32.395 --> 00:36:35.833
in not in our branch but in
the common branch leading to

00:36:35.833 --> 00:36:37.656
humans, chimps and gorillas.

00:36:37.656 --> 00:36:40.052
This is where we see the biggest excess

00:36:40.052 --> 00:36:42.130
of duplicated sequences

00:36:42.130 --> 00:36:43.696
and almost all the duplications

00:36:43.696 --> 00:36:45.856
that are causing disease in our species

00:36:45.856 --> 00:36:48.384
associated with development
of delay in autism

00:36:48.384 --> 00:36:50.714
are mapping to duplications
that evolved here,

00:36:50.714 --> 00:36:52.945
and evolved right around the separation

00:36:52.945 --> 00:36:55.528
of chimps, gorillas and humans.

00:36:57.184 --> 00:36:58.943
Second point.

00:36:58.943 --> 00:37:00.510
What I presented in
terms of the organization

00:37:00.510 --> 00:37:01.905
was too simple.

00:37:01.905 --> 00:37:04.036
So if you actually go and actually look at

00:37:04.036 --> 00:37:06.737
the structures of these
duplications within a chromosome,

00:37:06.737 --> 00:37:08.762
here's your chromosome 16.

00:37:08.762 --> 00:37:10.184
And these little numbers here indicate

00:37:10.184 --> 00:37:13.465
the structures that are
indicated on the right here.

00:37:13.465 --> 00:37:15.672
Anything that you see in color

00:37:15.672 --> 00:37:16.780
means that we've been able to determine

00:37:16.780 --> 00:37:18.813
the evolutionary origin of the segment.

00:37:18.813 --> 00:37:20.252
So whenever you see the same color

00:37:20.252 --> 00:37:22.827
that means this came from the same origin,

00:37:22.827 --> 00:37:25.384
in this case on chromosome 16.

00:37:25.384 --> 00:37:28.055
And so, you get this
picture of duplications

00:37:28.055 --> 00:37:30.869
that are made up of different
pieces of the genome

00:37:30.869 --> 00:37:34.128
that have stitched together
to build these complex mosaics

00:37:34.128 --> 00:37:36.312
or modular structures.

00:37:36.312 --> 00:37:38.278
And then they, actually some are

00:37:38.278 --> 00:37:39.337
very similar to one another

00:37:39.337 --> 00:37:41.856
but some are actually very
different to one another.

00:37:41.856 --> 00:37:43.684
But the really remarkable thing

00:37:43.684 --> 00:37:45.258
and it's true for every chromosome

00:37:45.258 --> 00:37:47.825
that has experienced this
burst of duplications

00:37:47.825 --> 00:37:49.806
is that in those chromosomes you see

00:37:49.806 --> 00:37:51.623
a specific sequence.

00:37:51.623 --> 00:37:53.365
And this is indicated here by the red

00:37:53.365 --> 00:37:55.672
we call it a Core Duplicon.

00:37:55.672 --> 00:37:57.625
It is the place of the
genome where it seems to be

00:37:57.625 --> 00:37:59.208
the focal point for the building up

00:37:59.208 --> 00:38:01.717
to these more complex architectures.

00:38:01.717 --> 00:38:04.294
This sequence is over-represented

00:38:04.294 --> 00:38:06.534
way more than you'd expect by chance.

00:38:06.534 --> 00:38:08.006
And it seems to actually be involved

00:38:08.006 --> 00:38:10.260
somehow inherently in this duplication

00:38:10.260 --> 00:38:14.390
and this interspersed
duplication architecture.

00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:16.604
Moreover most of the recurrent

00:38:16.604 --> 00:38:18.765
rearrangements that are
associated with disease

00:38:18.765 --> 00:38:23.303
are meted by duplication
blocks that have these cores.

00:38:23.303 --> 00:38:26.920
So we came up with the simple
hypothesis back in 2008.

00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:28.069
Maybe the disadvantage of this

00:38:28.069 --> 00:38:30.186
interspersed duplication
architecture is offset

00:38:30.186 --> 00:38:32.867
by the emergence of new
genes with new functions

00:38:32.867 --> 00:38:35.960
which override the actually
selective disadvantage of this

00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:37.604
which is predisposing us to disease

00:38:37.604 --> 00:38:39.042
or our children to disease.

00:38:39.042 --> 00:38:41.518
And maybe contributing
to the unique features

00:38:41.518 --> 00:38:42.436
that make us human,

00:38:42.436 --> 00:38:45.708
i.e. the developing of the human brain.

00:38:45.708 --> 00:38:47.092
So, is there any evidence?

00:38:47.092 --> 00:38:49.245
So you've seen a version of this slide.

00:38:49.245 --> 00:38:51.000
These were examples of the youngest

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:52.657
duplications that have evolved

00:38:52.657 --> 00:38:54.993
and some of the genes are
listed here at the bottom.

00:38:54.993 --> 00:38:58.281
This is the copy number that
we estimate in the genome

00:38:58.281 --> 00:39:00.781
of multiple humans from
Asia, Europe and Africa

00:39:00.781 --> 00:39:02.787
compared to chimp, orangutan and gorilla

00:39:02.787 --> 00:39:05.129
shown here in gray and black.

00:39:05.129 --> 00:39:08.486
These are human-specific
duplication events.

00:39:08.486 --> 00:39:10.568
And one of the things
that we and Jim Sikela

00:39:10.568 --> 00:39:13.105
noticed early on is that there is actually

00:39:13.105 --> 00:39:17.066
a noticeable enrichment,
it's borderline significant

00:39:17.066 --> 00:39:18.967
because there's not that many genes

00:39:18.967 --> 00:39:20.180
of genes that have been implicated

00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:22.106
in terms of brain development.

00:39:22.106 --> 00:39:23.774
And what's really interesting
is if you actually look

00:39:23.774 --> 00:39:25.491
at the chimpanzee-specific

00:39:25.491 --> 00:39:27.479
or the gorilla-specific duplications,

00:39:27.479 --> 00:39:29.414
you don't see these types of genes.

00:39:29.414 --> 00:39:31.443
You see genes involved in immune response,

00:39:31.443 --> 00:39:33.648
genes involved in drug detoxification

00:39:33.648 --> 00:39:35.438
but you don't see these types of genes

00:39:35.438 --> 00:39:37.805
actually being enriched.

00:39:37.805 --> 00:39:39.047
So for example you've heard about

00:39:39.047 --> 00:39:42.098
SRGAP2 and ARHGAP11B be at this meeting,

00:39:42.098 --> 00:39:45.552
GTF2IRD is a transcription factor.

00:39:45.552 --> 00:39:47.750
Thought to be important in
terms of visual-spatial defects

00:39:47.750 --> 00:39:50.266
associate with the
Williams Syndrome disease.

00:39:50.266 --> 00:39:52.895
GPIN, GPRIN is a G couple protein inducer

00:39:52.895 --> 00:39:54.658
of neurite outgrowth.

00:39:54.658 --> 00:39:58.825
CHRFAM7A is a related nicotinamide
acetylcholine receptor.

00:40:00.026 --> 00:40:02.163
HYDIN is a gene that's
important in fluid flow

00:40:02.163 --> 00:40:03.919
in terms of developing brain.

00:40:03.919 --> 00:40:06.799
SMN1, survival motor neuron protein

00:40:06.799 --> 00:40:09.263
and incredibly important in terms of

00:40:09.263 --> 00:40:11.263
spinal muscular atrophy.

00:40:12.342 --> 00:40:14.529
Two stories that you heard here.

00:40:14.529 --> 00:40:17.568
In fact I think rise
above a just-so story.

00:40:17.568 --> 00:40:20.590
The one you heard from
Franck all about SRGAP2C.

00:40:20.590 --> 00:40:21.885
So we were involved in kind of

00:40:21.885 --> 00:40:24.666
characterizing this duplication.

00:40:24.666 --> 00:40:27.565
It turns out that the actual gene itself

00:40:27.565 --> 00:40:29.840
wasn't in the human genome in 2012.

00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:32.189
So we had to actually go
and clone and sequence it.

00:40:32.189 --> 00:40:34.241
In 2012 it turns out
there was only one copy

00:40:34.241 --> 00:40:35.953
in the human reference
and there are actually

00:40:35.953 --> 00:40:39.275
four of which one is a clear pseudo gene.

00:40:39.275 --> 00:40:41.758
Ancestor produced a
daughter called SRGAP2A

00:40:41.758 --> 00:40:44.911
about 3.2 million years ago
with a secondary duplication

00:40:44.911 --> 00:40:49.846
leading to SRGAP2C which is
this duplicate truncated form

00:40:49.846 --> 00:40:51.614
that antagonizes the function

00:40:51.614 --> 00:40:53.624
that's thought to be important in terms of

00:40:53.624 --> 00:40:55.128
altering spine development

00:40:55.128 --> 00:40:58.315
as well as excitatory
and inhibitory synapses.

00:40:58.315 --> 00:41:00.857
The other story you heard
was from Wieland Huttner.

00:41:00.857 --> 00:41:03.433
We discovered this or at
least the duplicated sequence

00:41:03.433 --> 00:41:07.013
back in the early 2000s and
actually characterized it

00:41:07.013 --> 00:41:10.146
and reconstructed the
evolutionary history in 2014.

00:41:10.146 --> 00:41:12.354
And this was a gene
that as you heard today

00:41:12.354 --> 00:41:14.031
thought to be important
in terms of increasing

00:41:14.031 --> 00:41:16.254
the number of basal radial glial divisions

00:41:16.254 --> 00:41:20.266
or also known as auto
ventricular cell divisions

00:41:20.266 --> 00:41:23.823
that may be important in terms
of increasing neuronal count.

00:41:23.823 --> 00:41:25.973
The common theme about these

00:41:25.973 --> 00:41:28.153
is that each of them are truncated

00:41:28.153 --> 00:41:31.660
with respect to the parent copy
so they're not full length.

00:41:31.660 --> 00:41:33.444
These genes or these duplications

00:41:33.444 --> 00:41:35.830
are also associated with
genomic instability.

00:41:35.830 --> 00:41:37.537
So in the case of 15q13

00:41:37.537 --> 00:41:40.175
that's associate with
that schizophrenia form

00:41:40.175 --> 00:41:44.796
and as well as epilepsy
that I showed you earlier.

00:41:44.796 --> 00:41:46.995
And in these particular
cases it looks as if

00:41:46.995 --> 00:41:49.117
the duplication itself may have been

00:41:49.117 --> 00:41:51.288
the incomplete nature but
may have been important

00:41:51.288 --> 00:41:52.920
for the neo functionalization of it

00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:56.541
for the actual evolution of new function.

00:41:56.541 --> 00:41:59.320
So I'm gonna end with a
story on this last one

00:41:59.320 --> 00:42:00.616
which we just recently published

00:42:00.616 --> 00:42:01.760
and we continue to characterize.

00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:03.325
So this is this picture of chromosome 16

00:42:03.325 --> 00:42:04.719
I showed you before.

00:42:04.719 --> 00:42:07.175
And I'm gonna zoom in on
these duplication blocks

00:42:07.175 --> 00:42:09.210
that evolved over the
last few million years

00:42:09.210 --> 00:42:11.028
in the evolution of our genome.

00:42:11.028 --> 00:42:12.746
And the reason that this particular

00:42:12.746 --> 00:42:15.742
duplication pair is so important

00:42:15.742 --> 00:42:18.893
is that recurrent rearrangements of it

00:42:18.893 --> 00:42:21.313
actually results in the
second most common cause

00:42:21.313 --> 00:42:23.474
of autism in the human species.

00:42:23.474 --> 00:42:27.307
That is of a deletion
of chromosome 16 p11.2

00:42:27.307 --> 00:42:30.663
and the 25 to 28 genes
that map between these.

00:42:30.663 --> 00:42:33.470
So this is the second most
common cause of autism

00:42:33.470 --> 00:42:36.143
genetically known in the human population.

00:42:36.143 --> 00:42:39.339
Result of duplications
that evolved specifically

00:42:39.339 --> 00:42:43.179
in the last few million
years in our species.

00:42:43.179 --> 00:42:45.235
So I convinced a student
about four years ago

00:42:45.235 --> 00:42:46.450
to go and characterize this

00:42:46.450 --> 00:42:48.891
and do a comparative evolutionary study

00:42:48.891 --> 00:42:51.041
which almost no one ever seems
to do at the genetic level

00:42:51.041 --> 00:42:53.001
because they think the genomes are done.

00:42:53.001 --> 00:42:55.008
And so, in a week moment he agreed,

00:42:55.008 --> 00:42:57.140
so the student was named Xander Nuttle.

00:42:57.140 --> 00:43:00.721
And this was just showing
you kind of our sequencing.

00:43:00.721 --> 00:43:02.503
So the way he did it was
kind of old-fashioned.

00:43:02.503 --> 00:43:04.611
He took large insert
clones and sequenced them

00:43:04.611 --> 00:43:06.771
and reassembled because we
didn't trust the genomes

00:43:06.771 --> 00:43:07.966
that were assembled.

00:43:07.966 --> 00:43:09.433
And the way I'm gonna
show you these pictures,

00:43:09.433 --> 00:43:10.266
I'm just going to show you,

00:43:10.266 --> 00:43:13.741
this is a portion of
chromosome 16 on the orangutan

00:43:13.741 --> 00:43:15.974
where the little ticks represent genes.

00:43:15.974 --> 00:43:18.438
So there's 48 genes that
are represented here.

00:43:18.438 --> 00:43:20.866
The color represents
the duplicated sequence,

00:43:20.866 --> 00:43:23.227
at least in my life I
always put that in color.

00:43:23.227 --> 00:43:26.524
And then the actual
arrows here indicate the

00:43:26.524 --> 00:43:28.196
kind of the what we call synteny.

00:43:28.196 --> 00:43:29.834
So it's the order of these segments

00:43:29.834 --> 00:43:33.176
with respect to other mammalian species.

00:43:33.176 --> 00:43:34.315
So other than the duplications,

00:43:34.315 --> 00:43:37.908
this order and these genes is
completely syntenic with mouse

00:43:37.908 --> 00:43:40.410
which diverged about 80
to 90 million years ago,

00:43:40.410 --> 00:43:43.024
so we believe this is the ancestral state.

00:43:43.024 --> 00:43:44.725
So then he repeated the experiment

00:43:44.725 --> 00:43:47.766
by looking at gorillas, chimps and humans.

00:43:47.766 --> 00:43:50.612
So I'm gonna show you
two chimps and two humans

00:43:50.612 --> 00:43:52.310
or one human right now for the exact same

00:43:52.310 --> 00:43:54.723
region of the genome.

00:43:54.723 --> 00:43:57.234
This is the exact same area of the genome.

00:43:57.234 --> 00:43:59.107
This, it's 1.4 megabases

00:43:59.107 --> 00:44:01.239
or a million base pairs in orangutan.

00:44:01.239 --> 00:44:03.194
And these are the two chimp versions

00:44:03.194 --> 00:44:06.399
of this particular portion
of chromosome 16 right here.

00:44:06.399 --> 00:44:09.217
And there's the human for comparison.

00:44:09.217 --> 00:44:12.064
Now the colors remember
represent the duplications

00:44:12.064 --> 00:44:15.351
and the arrows represent the segments.

00:44:15.351 --> 00:44:16.902
And so, the first thing
you should get from this

00:44:16.902 --> 00:44:18.455
when you look at it you say,

00:44:18.455 --> 00:44:20.299
god, that doesn't look
even close to the same,

00:44:20.299 --> 00:44:21.430
and you'd be right.

00:44:21.430 --> 00:44:23.462
Because this area of the genome

00:44:23.462 --> 00:44:25.265
has essentially doubled in size

00:44:25.265 --> 00:44:26.782
as a result of duplications

00:44:26.782 --> 00:44:28.184
in the chimp and the human lineage.

00:44:28.184 --> 00:44:30.998
Those are all the color bars.

00:44:30.998 --> 00:44:32.445
The interesting thing is,

00:44:32.445 --> 00:44:34.204
is that the patterns of duplications

00:44:34.204 --> 00:44:37.215
are almost completely different
between chimp and human.

00:44:37.215 --> 00:44:38.744
So remember the different colors represent

00:44:38.744 --> 00:44:40.697
different evolutionary origins.

00:44:40.697 --> 00:44:42.833
And you can see that there are some things

00:44:42.833 --> 00:44:45.046
that are similar, these little red ticks

00:44:45.046 --> 00:44:46.933
are those Core Duplicons but by and large,

00:44:46.933 --> 00:44:49.454
the structure is radically different.

00:44:49.454 --> 00:44:52.036
More interestingly, if
you actually look at

00:44:52.036 --> 00:44:54.693
the actual segments of the DNA itself

00:44:54.693 --> 00:44:57.078
you can see that they're
complete ordered differently

00:44:57.078 --> 00:44:59.080
between a chimp and a human.

00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:01.455
These segments, these
six segments of 48 genes

00:45:01.455 --> 00:45:02.605
have been shuffled around

00:45:02.605 --> 00:45:03.989
in completely different combinations.

00:45:03.989 --> 00:45:06.195
In fact my student
estimated parsimoniously

00:45:06.195 --> 00:45:09.875
that you would need 13
large-scale structural changes

00:45:09.875 --> 00:45:11.359
to actually convert a human

00:45:11.359 --> 00:45:14.247
to a chimp structure over this.

00:45:14.247 --> 00:45:18.258
So the idea that we're 99%
in this region of the genome

00:45:18.258 --> 00:45:20.302
actually has no meaning.

00:45:20.302 --> 00:45:22.644
We are so radically different

00:45:22.644 --> 00:45:25.976
but over a very focaled
region of our genome.

00:45:25.976 --> 00:45:27.745
Coming back to disease,

00:45:27.745 --> 00:45:31.235
this is the area that
causes autism in our kids

00:45:31.235 --> 00:45:32.668
and it's because we
have these duplications

00:45:32.668 --> 00:45:36.053
in a direct orientation of
the same type on either side.

00:45:36.053 --> 00:45:38.414
If you look at the chimp region five,

00:45:38.414 --> 00:45:41.254
both haplotypes they don't have this.

00:45:41.254 --> 00:45:42.592
They don't have the
duplication architecture

00:45:42.592 --> 00:45:44.372
that would predispose to disease.

00:45:44.372 --> 00:45:46.677
In other words they are not predisposed

00:45:46.677 --> 00:45:48.350
to developing this form of autism

00:45:48.350 --> 00:45:50.180
because they don't actually
have the architecture

00:45:50.180 --> 00:45:53.190
to predispose the instability.

00:45:53.190 --> 00:45:55.144
So what are humans look
like if you compare them?

00:45:55.144 --> 00:45:57.472
So thankfully we look much
more similar to one another,

00:45:57.472 --> 00:45:59.327
so this is three different
human chromosomes

00:45:59.327 --> 00:46:01.144
that are being compared.

00:46:01.144 --> 00:46:02.394
But we do differ

00:46:02.394 --> 00:46:04.644
and we differ over only one portion

00:46:04.644 --> 00:46:05.477
and this is indicated here

00:46:05.477 --> 00:46:08.577
by these orange and green arrows.

00:46:08.577 --> 00:46:11.512
There's a set of, there's a
region about a hundred kilobases

00:46:11.512 --> 00:46:13.929
that is expanding and
contracting like accordions

00:46:13.929 --> 00:46:16.987
on this region which
predisposes to autism.

00:46:16.987 --> 00:46:18.907
But on either side we're
expanding and contracting

00:46:18.907 --> 00:46:20.944
this hundred kilobase cassette.

00:46:20.944 --> 00:46:21.900
And if you look really carefully

00:46:21.900 --> 00:46:23.652
you'll see that there are four genes

00:46:23.652 --> 00:46:25.895
right over the area of change.

00:46:25.895 --> 00:46:27.345
and these are genes that are important

00:46:27.345 --> 00:46:29.530
both in drug detoxification we have found

00:46:29.530 --> 00:46:32.960
but also a gene's important
in terms of iron metabolism,

00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:35.045
this gene called BOLA2.

00:46:35.045 --> 00:46:36.588
This is a gene that's actually been shown

00:46:36.588 --> 00:46:38.295
biochemically both in vitro and in vivo

00:46:38.295 --> 00:46:41.416
to be important in terms
of recruiting more iron

00:46:41.416 --> 00:46:44.473
into a cell and and
helping it to essentially

00:46:44.473 --> 00:46:47.778
become stable in terms of the
proteins that it produces.

00:46:47.778 --> 00:46:50.773
So how do humans vary if you
look at thousands of them?

00:46:50.773 --> 00:46:53.460
This is 2,500 humans
that we're comparing now

00:46:53.460 --> 00:46:55.859
for copy number of this
hundred kilobase segment

00:46:55.859 --> 00:46:58.359
which contains this BOLA2 gene

00:46:59.332 --> 00:47:01.122
and here's the interesting part.

00:47:01.122 --> 00:47:03.231
You look at humans from all
the different continents

00:47:03.231 --> 00:47:06.072
and they're quite variable
in terms of their copy.

00:47:06.072 --> 00:47:08.971
But all of them or I
should say none of them

00:47:08.971 --> 00:47:11.939
go back to the ancestral
state is what you see

00:47:11.939 --> 00:47:14.162
in chimps, gorillas and orangutans.

00:47:14.162 --> 00:47:16.482
So every human has at least three.

00:47:16.482 --> 00:47:20.782
Most of us have five or
six of this duplication.

00:47:20.782 --> 00:47:22.994
A few at three but none go back to two

00:47:22.994 --> 00:47:25.787
is what you see in these species.

00:47:25.787 --> 00:47:28.262
And here's where it gets really cool.

00:47:28.262 --> 00:47:31.052
If you compare to Neanderthal and Denisova

00:47:31.052 --> 00:47:32.060
which you've heard a little bit about,

00:47:32.060 --> 00:47:33.798
they separated from us very recently,

00:47:33.798 --> 00:47:36.387
only about 400,000 to 500,000 years ago,

00:47:36.387 --> 00:47:38.773
they look like chimps and gorillas

00:47:38.773 --> 00:47:40.454
in terms of their copy number.

00:47:40.454 --> 00:47:43.307
If we look at archaic hominins

00:47:43.307 --> 00:47:45.162
or I should say archaic
humans not hominins,

00:47:45.162 --> 00:47:47.743
archaic humans so this would be humans

00:47:47.743 --> 00:47:50.777
that lived 30,000 to 40,000 years ago,

00:47:50.777 --> 00:47:52.527
they look like us.

00:47:52.527 --> 00:47:54.425
This is 400,000 years ago,

00:47:54.425 --> 00:47:57.055
this is 50,000 years ago.

00:47:57.055 --> 00:47:59.853
So what's really remarkable is that

00:47:59.853 --> 00:48:01.518
when we estimate the
time and we can do this

00:48:01.518 --> 00:48:02.966
with phylogenetic approaches,

00:48:02.966 --> 00:48:05.449
we estimate the birth of
this duplication to being

00:48:05.449 --> 00:48:08.149
about 282,000 years ago.

00:48:08.149 --> 00:48:11.325
This is where most
paleontologists estimate the root

00:48:11.325 --> 00:48:13.634
of the species Homo sapiens.

00:48:13.634 --> 00:48:16.390
Of course, the plus or
minus is 75,000 here.

00:48:16.390 --> 00:48:18.918
(audience laughs)

00:48:18.918 --> 00:48:23.217
One thing we can show from
basically doing a work,

00:48:23.217 --> 00:48:25.179
using methods involving evolutionary

00:48:25.179 --> 00:48:27.365
or phylogenetic methods is that the rate

00:48:27.365 --> 00:48:30.637
at which this expanded is
too rapid to be explained

00:48:30.637 --> 00:48:32.852
based on strictly neutral evolution.

00:48:32.852 --> 00:48:35.045
So this is not evolving neutrally.

00:48:35.045 --> 00:48:36.774
It's actually the fact
that we haven't gone back

00:48:36.774 --> 00:48:40.303
to the actual ancestral
state is very unusual

00:48:40.303 --> 00:48:42.578
specifically for a duplication
where copy number variation

00:48:42.578 --> 00:48:44.245
is always occurring.

00:48:45.221 --> 00:48:47.615
And copy number of this piece of DNA

00:48:47.615 --> 00:48:48.857
actually correlates expressions.

00:48:48.857 --> 00:48:50.110
So those of you who have more copies

00:48:50.110 --> 00:48:53.925
actually have more of
this bullet two expressed.

00:48:53.925 --> 00:48:56.372
We looked at this in terms
of expression differences

00:48:56.372 --> 00:48:57.961
between chimp and human with Rusty.

00:48:57.961 --> 00:48:59.635
So he had actually
published this early work

00:48:59.635 --> 00:49:00.468
that he mentioned already

00:49:00.468 --> 00:49:02.048
looking at induced pluripotent stem cells

00:49:02.048 --> 00:49:04.298
in chimps, bonobos and humans.

00:49:04.298 --> 00:49:06.188
And even though it didn't
make his top 10 list,

00:49:06.188 --> 00:49:07.384
it should have

00:49:07.384 --> 00:49:09.857
because this gene was actually expressed

00:49:09.857 --> 00:49:13.698
7.5 fold higher on average in the chimp

00:49:13.698 --> 00:49:16.056
or I should say the human
compared to the chimp.

00:49:16.056 --> 00:49:17.957
And the reason when we went
back and looked at this

00:49:17.957 --> 00:49:19.683
is because there was variance

00:49:19.683 --> 00:49:21.536
in actually the copy
number estimates in human

00:49:21.536 --> 00:49:24.714
because he looked at more than one human.

00:49:24.714 --> 00:49:26.990
So we did these experiments with his group

00:49:26.990 --> 00:49:29.508
and we could show that in
fact there is a big difference

00:49:29.508 --> 00:49:31.411
between humans and chimps and bonobos.

00:49:31.411 --> 00:49:34.233
But the biggest difference
happens early in development,

00:49:34.233 --> 00:49:36.584
what we consider induced
pluripotent stem cells.

00:49:36.584 --> 00:49:39.274
There's still some difference
between these NPCs,

00:49:39.274 --> 00:49:40.604
neuronal progenitor cells

00:49:40.604 --> 00:49:43.989
but that's the biggest
difference that we see.

00:49:43.989 --> 00:49:45.938
The one last point I'll
make is that in fact

00:49:45.938 --> 00:49:48.528
when we actually look at
the actual gene itself

00:49:48.528 --> 00:49:50.264
there is just a simple duplicate gene

00:49:50.264 --> 00:49:52.183
which is entirely represented.

00:49:52.183 --> 00:49:55.064
But because these
duplications are often mosaic

00:49:55.064 --> 00:49:57.346
we actually have identified a gene

00:49:57.346 --> 00:49:59.047
which looks like a complete fusion

00:49:59.047 --> 00:50:03.213
of part of BOLA2 with another
serine threonine kinase

00:50:03.213 --> 00:50:05.383
which now makes a duplication

00:50:05.383 --> 00:50:07.596
that has a fusion duplication

00:50:07.596 --> 00:50:09.511
that has an open reading frame.

00:50:09.511 --> 00:50:11.844
This is in fact to my knowledge

00:50:11.844 --> 00:50:15.010
the only Homo sapien-specific gene

00:50:15.010 --> 00:50:17.575
that distinguishes chimp
or I should say humans

00:50:17.575 --> 00:50:19.392
from Neanderthals and Denisova

00:50:19.392 --> 00:50:20.976
because Denisova and Neanderthals

00:50:20.976 --> 00:50:22.353
do not have this duplication

00:50:22.353 --> 00:50:24.625
therefore do not have the fusion.

00:50:24.625 --> 00:50:26.472
Coming back to the disease.

00:50:26.472 --> 00:50:28.786
Going back to the kids
that actually have autism

00:50:28.786 --> 00:50:30.523
and mapping the breakpoints of those kids,

00:50:30.523 --> 00:50:32.832
where did those break
point specifically occur?

00:50:32.832 --> 00:50:35.157
96% of the children that we've looked at

00:50:35.157 --> 00:50:37.838
that have this break point
associate with autism,

00:50:37.838 --> 00:50:40.807
their break point maps to
the Homo sapien-specific

00:50:40.807 --> 00:50:43.669
segment that evolved on the order of about

00:50:43.669 --> 00:50:45.855
280,000 years ago.

00:50:45.855 --> 00:50:47.446
And then this is just to
show you that if we look at

00:50:47.446 --> 00:50:49.495
those kids that have low copy number

00:50:49.495 --> 00:50:52.088
because those kids do
have lower copy than most,

00:50:52.088 --> 00:50:54.511
we in fact find out that
in fact half of them

00:50:54.511 --> 00:50:56.085
and the numbers are still small,

00:50:56.085 --> 00:50:57.627
they have problems with anemia

00:50:57.627 --> 00:50:59.458
and require iron supplementation

00:50:59.458 --> 00:51:00.621
compared to the rest of the kids

00:51:00.621 --> 00:51:03.059
with this particular deletion
who still have high copies

00:51:03.059 --> 00:51:05.533
of BOLA2 which do not have anemia,

00:51:05.533 --> 00:51:07.816
or they very have low incidence of anemia.

00:51:07.816 --> 00:51:10.321
So we think it's actually
relevant also to disease

00:51:10.321 --> 00:51:13.298
and kids that are anemic with autism.

00:51:13.298 --> 00:51:15.839
So in summary, I hope I've convinced you

00:51:15.839 --> 00:51:18.672
how cool our genome and how
absolutely chaotic it is

00:51:18.672 --> 00:51:20.448
with respect to duplications.

00:51:20.448 --> 00:51:23.115
That we've had this burst of duplications

00:51:23.115 --> 00:51:24.546
that has occurred on the order of

00:51:24.546 --> 00:51:26.355
eight to 15 million years ago

00:51:26.355 --> 00:51:28.417
before we separated a species

00:51:28.417 --> 00:51:30.900
but as we were separating the species.

00:51:30.900 --> 00:51:32.993
This wired us for disease

00:51:32.993 --> 00:51:34.847
so we actually have a lot of additional

00:51:34.847 --> 00:51:38.301
recurrent structural changes in our genome

00:51:38.301 --> 00:51:41.118
as a result of this
duplication architecture.

00:51:41.118 --> 00:51:42.880
But this has come with benefits

00:51:42.880 --> 00:51:45.059
and we think that and we hypothesize

00:51:45.059 --> 00:51:47.488
the Core Duplicon hypothesis is that the

00:51:47.488 --> 00:51:50.246
negative result of having
this interspersed architecture

00:51:50.246 --> 00:51:52.673
is offset by the emergence of new genes

00:51:52.673 --> 00:51:55.780
we consider SRGAP2C and ARHGAP11B

00:51:55.780 --> 00:51:58.972
to be some of our best
examples of these types

00:51:58.972 --> 00:52:01.134
but we think there'll be others.

00:52:01.134 --> 00:52:03.952
And we also think BOLA2 is
particularly interesting

00:52:03.952 --> 00:52:07.009
because it's a Homo
sapien-specific expansion

00:52:07.009 --> 00:52:10.071
which we think will be
relevant for iron homeostasis

00:52:10.071 --> 00:52:13.251
or improving our ability to recruit iron.

00:52:13.251 --> 00:52:15.133
And at the same time is predisposing us

00:52:15.133 --> 00:52:17.168
to the most common or
second most common cause

00:52:17.168 --> 00:52:20.023
of autism in the human species.

00:52:20.023 --> 00:52:21.999
So when I think about the
evolution of our genome

00:52:21.999 --> 00:52:23.421
and this is the way I think about it,

00:52:23.421 --> 00:52:24.815
I think of actually a balancing act

00:52:24.815 --> 00:52:28.479
between both disease and evolution.

00:52:28.479 --> 00:52:30.352
These are the folks that did all the work

00:52:30.352 --> 00:52:34.312
and I will show you Seattle in the sun

00:52:34.312 --> 00:52:35.909
because this is just to show you

00:52:35.909 --> 00:52:38.727
that the sun does shine in Seattle.

00:52:38.727 --> 00:52:39.843
Thank you

00:52:39.843 --> 00:52:43.010
(audience applauding)

00:52:44.109 --> 00:52:46.776
