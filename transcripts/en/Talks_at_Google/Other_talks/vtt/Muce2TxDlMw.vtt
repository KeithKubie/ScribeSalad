CHADE-MENG TAN:
Morning, everybody.

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:04.970
Thank you all for being here.

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:06.060
My name is Meng.

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.320
I'm the Jolly Good
Fellow of Google,

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.255
and I'm delighted to be
here with my friend Shawn,

00:00:11.255 --> 00:00:15.100
a fellow Jolly Good
Fellow and also

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.980
a fellow international
bestselling author,

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.570
whose latest book is
"Before Happiness,"

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.020
available at all
major bookstores.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.360
The first thing you need
to know about Shawn Achor

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.600
is that he is
genuinely really nice.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.470
You know about his
public persona.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.750
He's that nice,
smiling, happy guy.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.804
And in person, he
is really that guy.

00:00:39.804 --> 00:00:41.220
So that's the first
thing you need

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.490
to know about him, genuinely
beautiful human being.

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:47.540
The second thing you
need to know about Shawn

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.800
is that he has one of the
most popular TED Talks

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.030
ever, almost 6 million
views the last I checked,

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.420
like 5.9 million or something.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.030
So if he has $1 per
view, he's going

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.490
to be the Six
Million Dollar Man.

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:06.080
He's going to run in
slow motion all the time.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.330
His lectures airing on PBS
have been seen by millions.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:16.230
He is the winner of a dozen
Distinguished Teaching Awards

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:18.280
at Harvard University,
a fairly good university

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.282
the last I heard.

00:01:20.282 --> 00:01:22.140
Just kidding.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.510
Shawn is one of the
world's leading experts

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:29.040
on the connection between
happiness and success,

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.590
and he has traveled
to 50 countries.

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.150
The first 49, it's kind of meh.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.020
But 50, that was impressive.

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.180
With that, my friends, please
welcome my friend Shawn A.

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.168
SHAWN ACHOR: Thank you.

00:01:43.168 --> 00:01:45.660
Thank you, everyone.

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.494
CHADE-MENG TAN: So thank
you for being here.

00:01:47.494 --> 00:01:49.118
I've been looking
forward to having you

00:01:49.118 --> 00:01:50.170
for a really long time.

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:51.020
SHAWN ACHOR: Me too.

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.020
I'm absolutely thrilled.

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.880
And thank you so
much for coming out.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.484
It makes it so much more fun to
have even all the people that

00:01:58.484 --> 00:01:59.400
are being streamed in.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.229
So thank you.

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.770
CHADE-MENG TAN: So this is going
to be purely a conversation.

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.840
Q&amp;A is a composition
between us and Shawn.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.840
And I'm just going ask a
couple questions, and about

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.970
halfway into this
conversation we're

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.030
going to invite you
to ask him questions.

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.819
Feel free to embarrass him.

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:16.610
Don't embarrass me.

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.790
Embarrass this guy.

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.690
So Shawn, my first question
for you a very simple question,

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.165
how do you define happiness?

00:02:27.357 --> 00:02:29.440
SHAWN ACHOR: It's actually
pretty difficult for us

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.770
to define it.

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.860
As Meng mentioned,
I've traveled to now

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.340
over 50 countries over
the past seven years

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.277
studying happiness,
which is great.

00:02:39.277 --> 00:02:41.360
And one of the things that
I realized very quickly

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.470
was that everyone had
a different definition

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.170
of happiness, What they
thought would create happiness,

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.074
the triggers for
happiness seemed

00:02:49.074 --> 00:02:50.990
to be different based
upon different cultures,

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.830
different individuals, even
at the same organization.

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.800
So if you can't define
it, maybe can't study it.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.345
And if you can't
study it, then we

00:02:58.345 --> 00:03:00.095
can't have things like
positive psychology

00:03:00.095 --> 00:03:02.450
that are looking at how do
we raise levels of happiness

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:03.810
for other people.

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.114
Part of what we found is
that even though everyone

00:03:06.114 --> 00:03:07.530
in this room and
everyone watching

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.310
has different
definitions of happiness,

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.270
if I ask you on a
scale of 1 to 10

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:15.340
how happy you felt over the
past two weeks, most of us

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.390
can kind of put ourselves
on that spectrum.

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.615
We can put ourselves
somewhere on that range.

00:03:21.615 --> 00:03:23.840
What we found is that
even though that's

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.550
a subjective experience,
if I go into a hospital

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.220
with a broken arm, there's no
pain meter they can hook me

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.090
up to that automatically means
I'm experiencing an 8 out

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.920
of 10 on a pain scale, the
same thing is true happiness.

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.605
We treat people
based upon the pain

00:03:38.605 --> 00:03:40.750
that they actually experience,
and we can actually

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.000
study people based upon
their subjective experience

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.170
of happiness that they're
experiencing in the world.

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.419
Part of what I'm hoping to
do and part of the reason I

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:51.260
wanted to come to
talk with you is

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.430
that what I'd love for us to do
is to help the world redefine

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:55.681
what happiness actually means.

00:03:55.681 --> 00:03:57.888
Because I think that there's
a lot of confusion about

00:03:57.888 --> 00:03:59.100
what happiness actually is.

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.130
And if we do come up with a
definition that's aspirational,

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.910
maybe we can start a movement
not only within our schools

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:08.790
and in our families but in
our companies worldwide.

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.210
There's a lot of articles
that are coming out right now

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:14.800
talking about how
having a happy life

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.120
and having a meaningful life
that a meaningful life is

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.709
so much better than having
a happy life in terms

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:23.150
of the levels of health you
experience in the long run.

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.700
I think those studies,
while well-meaning,

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.940
are actually leading us astray.

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.830
Because I think it's
impossible for us

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.400
to sustain happiness
without meaning.

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.282
And as soon as we start to try
to define happiness in our life

00:04:36.282 --> 00:04:38.240
without having meaning,
all we're talking about

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.120
is pleasure.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.340
And pleasure is very
short-term, right?

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.840
We could put chocolate bars
in front of each of you,

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.179
and then we'd be done in
terms of our happiness.

00:04:47.179 --> 00:04:49.470
Somebody's like, wait, was
that an option this morning?

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.250
I didn't even know that
that would be an option.

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:51.960
CHADE-MENG TAN: It's Google.

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:52.730
It's always an option.

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:53.605
SHAWN ACHOR: Exactly.

00:04:53.605 --> 00:04:54.286
Exactly.

00:04:54.286 --> 00:04:55.910
You've got pleasure
at your fingertips,

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:58.243
but that doesn't necessarily
mean that you automatically

00:04:58.243 --> 00:04:59.740
have happiness at
your fingertips.

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:01.690
Because happiness,
the way that we

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:05.020
are hoping to start your
redefine this for the world

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:06.990
is to not have
happiness be pleasure,

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:08.480
because that's very short-term.

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:09.425
And we get addicted to

00:05:09.425 --> 00:05:09.925
It.

00:05:09.925 --> 00:05:11.591
We were talking about
that this morning.

00:05:11.591 --> 00:05:14.220
If happiness is just a pleasure,
it becomes a trap, right?

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.139
So if I'm not feeling
pleasure right now,

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:17.430
well, then I must not be happy.

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:18.790
Then I'm not going to
keep working at this,

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:20.950
or I'm not going to keep
trying, because this

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:21.920
is too difficult now.

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.830
What I'm interested in is
how do we redefine happiness

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:31.250
to be-- I stole this definition
from the ancient Greeks--

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:34.970
the joy that we feel
striving for our potential?

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:36.620
And I love this definition.

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:38.650
I was at the Divinity
School before getting

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:40.295
into studying
positive psychology,

00:05:40.295 --> 00:05:43.130
and I was studying Christian
and Buddhist ethics.

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:45.250
Because I was interested
in how does the beliefs

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:47.880
you have about the
world change the actions

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.850
you decide to do
within that world.

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:52.420
And one of the things that I
loved about this definition

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:55.260
when I saw it is it changes the
way that we pursue happiness.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:56.954
Because if happiness
is just pleasure,

00:05:56.954 --> 00:05:58.870
we have to keep running
after it very quickly,

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:00.970
and we know it's
not going to last.

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:03.898
But if happiness is
joy, joy is something

00:06:03.898 --> 00:06:05.772
we can feel in the ups
and downs of our life.

00:06:05.772 --> 00:06:08.070
It's something we can experience
even when things are not

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:10.050
pleasurable, when you're working
on a very difficult project,

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:11.780
when you're going
for a difficult run,

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:14.780
or when you're biking into
and it's a really long bike

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:16.750
ride, whatever is it
you're experiencing.

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:19.380
Even childbirth is not
a pleasurable experience

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:21.540
all the time, but
you can actually

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:23.750
feel joy in the midst of that.

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:26.330
What I want people to do is
to recognize and to actually

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:28.850
seek out that joy, which I know
is one of your pet projects

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:29.670
as well.

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:33.270
How do you see joy, but joy
that's connected to growth?

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:36.550
Because if happiness is actually
disconnected from growth,

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:39.700
it turns out we stagnate
and our happiness

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:41.150
goes away pretty quickly.

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:43.580
I love playing video games.

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:44.580
I love them.

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:49.040
And they're very high levels of
pleasure, and I'm OK at them.

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:51.330
But in terms of
long-term meaning,

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:53.000
there's not too much
for me in my life.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.830
Now for some people, there's a
lot of meaning in video games.

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:56.290
But for me, not so much.

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:58.540
So if I keep doing it, even
though I'm having pleasure

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:00.710
that pleasure actually
dissipates after a while,

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:03.620
because I'm not actually
pursuing any of my potential

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:05.080
except within that one domain.

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:07.470
The thing I love about
joy that we experience

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:09.060
striving towards
our potential is

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:10.510
that potential
could be anything.

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:13.900
It could be as an entrepreneur,
as a business leader.

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:19.200
It could be as a lover,
as a son, as a daughter,

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:20.340
as a human being.

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:22.400
And the more than we actually
strive towards that potential,

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.191
that's where people
experience that greater

00:07:24.191 --> 00:07:25.730
levels of happiness,
and it allows

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:29.150
us to stop making that disjunct
between happiness and success.

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:32.110
Because I was out in Indonesia,
and I was speaking out

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:33.362
at one of the factories there.

00:07:33.362 --> 00:07:35.320
And one of the managers
came up to me and said,

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:37.970
this talk on happiness might
work at places like Google

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:40.050
or it might work in
places in America,

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:43.225
but seriously actually our
problem in our country is not

00:07:43.225 --> 00:07:44.460
that people are unhappy work.

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:47.770
Our problem is sometimes
people are way too happy.

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:51.460
Because I had this guy come into
work three hours late today,

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:53.410
and I tried to yell at
him, and he was like,

00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:54.880
what are you doing?

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:56.630
Let's just relax and
just enjoy ourselves.

00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:59.244
And I was like, that guy
didn't make me happy at all.

00:07:59.244 --> 00:08:01.660
But what he's talking about
there is not happiness, right?

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:02.790
That's short-term pleasure.

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:04.320
The guy decide to
stay home that morning

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:06.653
and didn't do the work that
he was supposed to be doing.

00:08:06.653 --> 00:08:09.099
But if that's what
it is, then long-term

00:08:09.099 --> 00:08:11.390
his levels of happiness are
actually going to decrease.

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:13.290
He's never going to get to
see what his potential was

00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:14.331
within that organization.

00:08:14.331 --> 00:08:16.390
He might not get to see
what his potential was

00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:20.950
in terms of applying his
self-control and his behavior

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:21.650
to his task.

00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:23.800
So what we want people
to do is to recognize

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:30.970
that that can be more
on the side of apathy.

00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:33.860
I think the opposite of
happiness is not unhappiness.

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:37.280
The opposite of
happiness is apathy,

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:39.620
which is the loss of joy that
we feel within our lives.

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:42.049
Because if you think about
it, unhappiness can sometimes

00:08:42.049 --> 00:08:44.190
make us breakup with people
we shouldn't be dating.

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:46.715
Or unhappiness can cause us
to move to do different jobs,

00:08:46.715 --> 00:08:49.840
or it can cause us to want to
get better grades in school.

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:51.470
Unhappiness can be very helpful.

00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:53.970
What I think becomes
the problem is

00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:56.260
when we've lost that
joy in our life, when

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.760
we lose that joy striving
towards our potential.

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:00.850
So I think that there's a
revolution inside of us.

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:03.285
If we can help people
realize that happiness is joy

00:09:03.285 --> 00:09:05.700
that we feel on the
way to our potential,

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:07.880
some amazing things
start to change.

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:09.300
CHADE-MENG TAN: Fascinating.

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:11.630
It's especially
fascinating in the context

00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:14.870
of one of your teachings
from your previous book,

00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:17.650
which I thought was
ground-breaking.

00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:21.540
And when I first read it,
I was really impressed.

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:24.230
In your previous book, which
is "The Happiness Advantage,"

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:27.480
you talk about the relationship
between happiness and success.

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:30.701
And you put it on
its head, the reverse

00:09:30.701 --> 00:09:32.200
of what everybody
else was thinking.

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:32.470
SHAWN ACHOR: Yeah.

00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:33.080
CHADE-MENG TAN:
Which is everybody

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:35.810
was thinking that if you're
successful, you're happy,

00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:38.125
which is basically the
premise of Asian parenting.

00:09:38.125 --> 00:09:38.916
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]

00:09:38.916 --> 00:09:39.848
CHADE-MENG TAN: Right?

00:09:39.848 --> 00:09:43.110
Trust me, I know.

00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:45.700
But what you say,
and I agree with you,

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:47.100
is that it's the reverse.

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:51.580
It's that happiness
brings about success.

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:53.500
So can you talk more about that?

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:54.250
SHAWN ACHOR: Sure.

00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:59.280
So you guys might have heard
"The Battle Hymn of the Tiger

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:01.950
Mother" book that came out
about tiger parenting, which

00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:04.340
is the style of parenting
you're describing,

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:07.480
which is I'm going to
push you so far right now,

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:10.210
and you're going to hate me for
it, but when you're successful,

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:12.450
when you're off at
Harvard, Stanford,

00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:14.950
when you've got a good job,
then you're going to be happier.

00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:16.060
CHADE-MENG TAN: Right.

00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:18.309
SHAWN ACHOR: And it turns
out that that formula, which

00:10:18.309 --> 00:10:21.330
undergirds our managing styles
at most companies, our learning

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:23.790
styles, our personal
development styles, it's

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:27.270
scientifically broken and
backwards for two reasons.

00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:30.804
The first reason is that every
time your brain has a success--

00:10:30.804 --> 00:10:31.970
and you've experienced this.

00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:33.511
Everyone in this
room has experienced

00:10:33.511 --> 00:10:36.690
this-- your brain just
changes the goal post of what

00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:38.765
success looks like for
you almost immediately.

00:10:38.765 --> 00:10:40.140
You've got good
grades in school?

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:41.620
Don't get excited
yet, because now you

00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:42.953
need to get into better schools.

00:10:42.953 --> 00:10:44.190
You got into a better school?

00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:46.490
Don't get excited there, because
then you have to get a job.

00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:47.510
You don't even have
a job yet, right?

00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:49.060
So you have to get that
internship and job.

00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:50.143
You hit your sales target?

00:10:50.143 --> 00:10:51.600
We raise your sales target.

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:53.380
You had double growth
earnings last year?

00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:54.140
That's phenomenal.

00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:56.120
That means we can double
the growth again this year.

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:57.244
And that's not the problem.

00:10:57.244 --> 00:10:59.170
We want to see what your
brain is capable of.

00:10:59.170 --> 00:11:00.650
We want growth to improve.

00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:02.025
We want to see
sales improve, all

00:11:02.025 --> 00:11:03.483
of these different
types of things.

00:11:03.483 --> 00:11:05.920
The problem is where happiness
comes in that formula.

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:08.080
Because if happiness
comes after success,

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:09.710
which is a moving
target, the brain

00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:12.590
never gets there for very long.

00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:14.850
We can raise your success
rates your entire life.

00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:15.967
We can raise your income.

00:11:15.967 --> 00:11:17.050
We don't actually do this.

00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:19.190
We watch people whose
success rates rise.

00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:21.080
That'd be very
hard for us to do.

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:23.330
We watch people whose success
rates rise dramatically,

00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:26.250
and their happiness
levels flatline.

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:27.490
They actually don't move.

00:11:27.490 --> 00:11:29.775
So as your success
rises in your life,

00:11:29.775 --> 00:11:32.232
your happiness levels will
actually remain about the same.

00:11:32.232 --> 00:11:33.690
But flip around
the formula, if you

00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:36.680
can get people to deepen the
social connection they feel,

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:38.930
the meaning embedded in the
relationships, the breadth

00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:41.480
and depth of the relationships,
if you change and raise

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:43.855
their levels of optimism, if
you get people to see stress

00:11:43.855 --> 00:11:45.880
as a challenge instead
of as a threat,

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:47.710
when our brain is
positive first,

00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:50.870
every single educational
outcome and business outcome

00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:53.580
we can test for
rises dramatically,

00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:54.850
and our success rates rise.

00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:57.200
So raised success rates,
happiness flatlines.

00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:59.790
But raise levels of happiness
withinside organizations

00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:01.360
and schools, and
their success rates

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:06.060
rise dramatically,
which is phenomenal.

00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:10.134
I spent 12 years at Harvard,
first as an undergraduate

00:12:10.134 --> 00:12:11.550
and then I was at
Divinity School,

00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:13.330
and then I was a
teaching fellow there.

00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:19.290
And when I first got into
Harvard, I applied on a dare,

00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:21.220
so I didn't expect to get in.

00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:22.790
We didn't have any
money for college,

00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:25.640
but I got a Navy
ROTC scholarship,

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:28.790
which allowed me to
go there through MIT.

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:31.630
And so I found myself in
classrooms full of people

00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:35.490
who were incredibly smart
and were just amazing.

00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:37.790
And I remember that I could
have felt bad about myself,

00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:40.550
like the mistake, but I remember
just sitting there thinking

00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:42.520
this is amazing to get
to have the opportunity

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:45.190
like this morning,
to get to spend time

00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:48.370
with all these incredibly
brilliant and motivated people.

00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:51.270
And you can look around,
and for many of you--

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:55.430
I know some of you are
from Harvard, actually--

00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:57.000
and you could see
the students who

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.630
saw their education
as a privilege.

00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:01.630
They saw what they were
doing as an opportunity,

00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:03.838
and they invested in it in
completely different ways.

00:13:03.838 --> 00:13:05.970
They'd take classes that
they'd get a bad grade in,

00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:08.949
like an A-minus, just
because they wanted to learn.

00:13:08.949 --> 00:13:10.490
Or they'd get involved
with a sport--

00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:12.435
CHADE-MENG TAN:
Obviously not Asian.

00:13:12.435 --> 00:13:13.490
That's like an Asian C.

00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:14.365
SHAWN ACHOR: Exactly.

00:13:14.365 --> 00:13:15.980
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]

00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:18.454
SHAWN ACHOR: I like that.

00:13:18.454 --> 00:13:20.690
CHADE-MENG TAN:
I'm just kidding.

00:13:20.690 --> 00:13:23.184
Almost.

00:13:23.184 --> 00:13:24.600
SHAWN ACHOR: We'd
have people that

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:27.881
would ride the bench on
a sport for three years

00:13:27.881 --> 00:13:29.630
just so they could
make friends, and those

00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:31.000
are the people who
loved their time there.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.010
And actually, in
one of our studies

00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:33.670
we found that those
are the people who

00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:35.200
give the most in
alumni donations

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:37.150
back to the school
later on, which

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:40.012
is why Harvard got interested
in happiness in the first place.

00:13:40.012 --> 00:13:42.500
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:45.530
SHAWN ACHOR: But afterwards,
I got the opportunity

00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:46.390
to stay at Harvard.

00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:49.090
I knew that if I left they
wouldn't let me back in.

00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:51.240
And so I stayed there
for the next eight years,

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:53.590
and I lived in the dorms with
the freshman as a Proctor

00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:54.730
there.

00:13:54.730 --> 00:14:00.490
And Harvard invited me to do
that-- I wasn't that guy who

00:14:00.490 --> 00:14:02.850
stays in the freshman dorms
meeting people-- for most

00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:03.030
of it.

00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:05.190
So what it meant was I could
watch these students transition

00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:06.522
from high school to college.

00:14:06.522 --> 00:14:08.230
And what I saw very
quickly was no matter

00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:10.852
how happy they were getting into
that school, two weeks later,

00:14:10.852 --> 00:14:12.310
many of them, their
brains were not

00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:14.856
focused on the privilege of
being there or even fully

00:14:14.856 --> 00:14:16.480
focused on their
philosophy or physics.

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:19.137
Their brains were scattered
thinking about the competition,

00:14:19.137 --> 00:14:21.470
the workload, the stresses,
the hassles, and complaints.

00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:23.920
And very quickly, what was
promised to create great

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:25.650
happiness wasn't.

00:14:25.650 --> 00:14:28.350
80% of Harvard students,
according to the "Crimson" poll

00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:30.235
that they had, 80%
of them reported

00:14:30.235 --> 00:14:32.610
experiencing depression at
sometime during the four years

00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:33.160
there.

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:35.770
And a study that came out in
2003 by the University Health

00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:40.000
Services, they measured
6,000 undergraduates

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.200
and found that 10% of them
had contemplated suicide

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:44.810
at some point during
their time there,

00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:46.930
which is extraordinarily high.

00:14:46.930 --> 00:14:48.720
And I know that
these are statistics,

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:50.187
but those are human beings.

00:14:50.187 --> 00:14:52.520
And it was heartbreaking
watching some of these students

00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:55.070
and some of the
people that we know

00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:59.500
lose that connection to meaning
in their life and the potential

00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:00.727
that they had.

00:15:00.727 --> 00:15:02.560
One of the studies that
I got to do early on

00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:04.590
was I looked at 1,600
Harvard students

00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:07.880
to find out who
rises to the top.

00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:10.100
If you have people that
are extremely intelligent,

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:12.240
extremely successful,
ambitious, who

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:14.615
rises to the top in terms of
their happiness and success?

00:15:14.615 --> 00:15:15.739
And I looked at everything.

00:15:15.739 --> 00:15:17.890
I looked at what grades
they got in school.

00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:20.140
I looked at their
familial income.

00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:22.590
We looked at the SAT scores
before getting into school.

00:15:22.590 --> 00:15:24.890
We looked at the number
of friends on Facebook.

00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:26.840
We looked at the number
of romantic partners

00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:27.590
that they had had.

00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:29.180
Which by the way,
at Harvard they've

00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:31.320
dated less than one
person, on average,

00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:33.350
after their entire
four years of college.

00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:33.980
CHADE-MENG TAN:
Must be engineering?

00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:34.522
I don't know.

00:15:34.522 --> 00:15:35.271
SHAWN ACHOR: Yeah.

00:15:35.271 --> 00:15:35.790
Possibly.

00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:39.230
It was lower than any
school we saw so far.

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:42.395
It was actually 0.5 sexual
partners per Harvard student.

00:15:42.395 --> 00:15:43.770
CHADE-MENG TAN:
Yep, engineering.

00:15:43.770 --> 00:15:44.520
SHAWN ACHOR: Yeah.

00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:45.312
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]

00:15:45.312 --> 00:15:47.561
SHAWN ACHOR: Which I only
mention because I don't even

00:15:47.561 --> 00:15:49.550
know what that
statistic means, 0.5.

00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:51.150
We were always
taught to round up.

00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:52.840
CHADE-MENG TAN: Better than MIT.

00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:54.890
SHAWN ACHOR: Possibly.

00:15:54.890 --> 00:15:55.390
Probably.

00:15:55.390 --> 00:15:57.350
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]

00:15:57.350 --> 00:15:58.920
SHAWN ACHOR: But
0.5 sexual partners,

00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:01.079
it's the scientific
equivalent of second base,

00:16:01.079 --> 00:16:02.620
and it was useless
information to us.

00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:06.340
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]

00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:09.000
SHAWN ACHOR: What we did find
was imagine a student who

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.647
ever since they
were one-year-old

00:16:10.647 --> 00:16:12.980
was placed into a crib wearing
a onesie that you can buy

00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:16.410
at the bookstore, at The Coop,
that says "Bound for Harvard"

00:16:16.410 --> 00:16:19.781
and maybe a cute little Yale
hat, in case something terrible

00:16:19.781 --> 00:16:20.280
happened.

00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:23.045
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]

00:16:23.045 --> 00:16:24.420
SHAWN ACHOR: And
ever since there

00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:27.259
were in special pre-K school
that they got into four years

00:16:27.259 --> 00:16:28.800
before they were
conceived, they were

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:30.390
at the top 1% of their class.

00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:32.960
Junior high, high school,
standardized tests, top 1%.

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:35.460
They get into Harvard, and they
have a terrible realization.

00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:37.615
50% of them are
now below average.

00:16:37.615 --> 00:16:39.240
And to put it more
poignantly, when

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:41.280
I was counseling students
I would tell them

00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:44.430
it seems as if 99%
of Harvard students

00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:47.336
do not graduate in
the top 1%, which

00:16:47.336 --> 00:16:48.600
they don't find funny at all.

00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:49.770
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]

00:16:49.770 --> 00:16:51.080
SHAWN ACHOR: But the
reason that's interesting

00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:52.454
is they decide
the only way I can

00:16:52.454 --> 00:16:56.530
be happy is if I'm in the
top 1% of one category of one

00:16:56.530 --> 00:16:57.810
institution, right?

00:16:57.810 --> 00:16:58.394
Not worldwide.

00:16:58.394 --> 00:16:59.851
And they pick
grades-- which if you

00:16:59.851 --> 00:17:02.340
know the research on grades,
you can roll a pair of dice,

00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:05.400
and that's as predictive
of your future job success

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:07.709
as your college GPA
is, which is why

00:17:07.709 --> 00:17:09.720
a lot of people who make
straight A's in college

00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:13.996
work for people who got
straight C's in business school.

00:17:13.996 --> 00:17:15.079
Some of you are like, yep.

00:17:15.079 --> 00:17:16.787
But part of what I
think is fascinating--

00:17:16.787 --> 00:17:17.710
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]

00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:19.960
SHAWN ACHOR: What I think
is so fascinating about this

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:22.349
is that we've got the
formula backwards.

00:17:22.349 --> 00:17:25.390
They thought, well, if I
got into a good school,

00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:28.640
if I got a great job, if I
got to where I am in life,

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:30.120
of course I'd be happier.

00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:32.110
And it turns out that
it doesn't automatically

00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:33.600
cause greater
levels of happiness.

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:36.711
But amazingly, the formula could
actually work in the other way.

00:17:36.711 --> 00:17:39.210
We found something that we now
call the happiness advantage,

00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:41.207
which is when the brain
is positive it has

00:17:41.207 --> 00:17:43.540
an unfair advantage over the
brain at negative, neutral,

00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:44.380
or stressed.

00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:45.930
You're 31% more productive.

00:17:45.930 --> 00:17:48.380
Sales rise from a
neutral salesperson

00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:51.870
to the same salesperson
at optimistic by 37%.

00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:54.630
We found that people who
provide social support work,

00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:57.000
you're 40% more likely
to receive a promotion

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.830
over the next two-year
period of time.

00:17:58.830 --> 00:18:01.330
We find that you live longer.

00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:02.620
We just did a study, actually.

00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:04.221
I love this study.

00:18:04.221 --> 00:18:05.720
I got to work with
one of my friends

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:09.360
who w one of my students
at Harvard, Alia Crum.

00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:12.750
And she went off to Yale.

00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:15.480
We did a joint study
at UBS in the middle

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:17.742
of the banking crisis,
the big Swiss bank.

00:18:17.742 --> 00:18:19.450
And one of the things
we were looking for

00:18:19.450 --> 00:18:21.870
is that oftentimes
the companies would

00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:24.670
want to push you very hard, and
then your stress levels rise,

00:18:24.670 --> 00:18:27.516
and then they give you a
stress management program.

00:18:27.516 --> 00:18:28.890
And the stress
management program

00:18:28.890 --> 00:18:30.520
goes something like this.

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:32.980
Did you know that stress is
related to the 10 leading

00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:35.442
causes of death and disease
in the United States?

00:18:35.442 --> 00:18:37.400
Did you know that the
World Health Organization

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:39.800
found stress to be
the number one killer?

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:42.900
Stress is related to 80% to 90%
of all doctor-related visits.

00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:44.900
And stress is catabolic.

00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:47.672
It literally tears down every
organ in the human body.

00:18:47.672 --> 00:18:49.630
As soon as you hear that,
what do you think it?

00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:50.709
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]

00:18:50.709 --> 00:18:51.750
SHAWN ACHOR: More stress.

00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:53.910
You're like, stop
emailing me so much work.

00:18:53.910 --> 00:18:56.820
You're destroying every
organ in my body, which

00:18:56.820 --> 00:18:59.080
I think would make a great
away message at work.

00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:02.640
But part of what we found
is that all of that's true.

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:04.770
All of that information
is absolutely true.

00:19:04.770 --> 00:19:06.720
Stress is terrible killer.

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:10.357
But just like with Vitamin
C and coffee and alcohol,

00:19:10.357 --> 00:19:11.940
we keep finding
studies that are like,

00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:14.530
alcohol will save your
life, and it will kill you.

00:19:14.530 --> 00:19:16.440
Vitamin C causes cancer
and cures cancer.

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:17.510
And we get so frustrated.

00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:18.800
We're like, well, what
am I supposed to do?

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:20.341
Am I supposed to
drink coffee or not?

00:19:20.341 --> 00:19:22.640
Am I supposed to
drink red wine or not?

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:25.377
The reason is that it's less
about the external world

00:19:25.377 --> 00:19:26.960
but about how your
body and your brain

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:30.040
process what comes into your
system and what you experience.

00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:31.570
The same thing's
true with stress.

00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:33.545
So there's an equally
true information

00:19:33.545 --> 00:19:36.990
that says that stress actually
releases a growth hormone that

00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:38.760
speeds up the
recovery of your cells

00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:40.380
faster than anything we've seen.

00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:42.650
Not low levels of stress
but moderate to high

00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:45.040
levels of stress actually
turn on your immune system

00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:46.640
to the highest possible level.

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:49.520
We found that stress deepens
your social bonds more

00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:52.010
than anything, which is
why last week I was out

00:19:52.010 --> 00:19:54.690
working at the Pentagon, and one
of the things they were saying

00:19:54.690 --> 00:19:57.270
is that's why we on-board
people in the military

00:19:57.270 --> 00:19:59.870
with bootcamp and
not a beach vacation,

00:19:59.870 --> 00:20:02.090
because we know that that
stressful period doesn't

00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:02.992
tear people down.

00:20:02.992 --> 00:20:04.950
It actually causes them
to create these meaning

00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:07.158
structures, these narratives,
and these relationships

00:20:07.158 --> 00:20:09.640
that they talk about for the
entire rest of their life.

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:11.580
In fact, every moment
of high human potential

00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:14.260
occurs in the midst of
stress, not the absence of it.

00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:16.170
So what we did is we
just showed them videos

00:20:16.170 --> 00:20:18.150
and created a small
training for the UBS

00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:20.520
employees in the middle
of a banking crisis

00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:23.030
when they went through
four restructurings

00:20:23.030 --> 00:20:26.330
and they were told that
they didn't get their bonus.

00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:28.300
One of my very first
talks was actually

00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:30.140
at a Swiss bank out in Zurich.

00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:33.167
And the introduction
was, we don't

00:20:33.167 --> 00:20:35.000
have bonuses for everyone,
but here's a talk

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.541
on happiness from
a guy from America.

00:20:36.541 --> 00:20:38.360
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]

00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:40.137
CHADE-MENG TAN: Yay.

00:20:40.137 --> 00:20:41.012
SHAWN ACHOR: Exactly.

00:20:44.861 --> 00:20:46.610
Which is amazing,
because they immediately

00:20:46.610 --> 00:20:48.019
stonewalled the information.

00:20:48.019 --> 00:20:49.560
But 10 minutes later,
as soon as they

00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:51.670
started hearing that
there's research about this,

00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:53.000
suddenly things
started to change.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.370
Because it wasn't
about just, oh, let's

00:20:54.370 --> 00:20:55.650
be happier in the midst
of this challenge.

00:20:55.650 --> 00:20:58.460
It was like, here's how we can
actually change the way that we

00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:00.540
view this world and
actually ripple this out

00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:02.647
to other people around us.

00:21:02.647 --> 00:21:03.480
I'm going off track.

00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:04.600
We can come back to that.

00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:07.266
But the part of what I found was
so interesting about the stress

00:21:07.266 --> 00:21:09.580
study was we had two groups.

00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:11.240
One group saw stress
as debilitating,

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:12.875
and one group saw
stress as enhancing.

00:21:12.875 --> 00:21:15.520
And we tracked them
for the next six weeks.

00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:19.089
And I was hoping that the group
that saw stress as enhancing

00:21:19.089 --> 00:21:20.880
would actually have
lower levels of stress.

00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:22.680
That was my hope,
and we were wrong.

00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:26.130
Turns out they had equal levels
of stress and extremely high.

00:21:26.130 --> 00:21:29.770
But their health-related
symptoms, their back aches,

00:21:29.770 --> 00:21:32.810
headaches, and fatigue,
their energy levels at work

00:21:32.810 --> 00:21:36.210
improved by 23% for the group
that saw stress as enhancing,

00:21:36.210 --> 00:21:38.610
a nearly 30% increase
in their productivity,

00:21:38.610 --> 00:21:40.240
and their levels of
happiness improved.

00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:43.250
What that means is stress
is inevitable in our lives,

00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:46.130
but the way that we
perceive stress changes how

00:21:46.130 --> 00:21:47.600
it affects the human body.

00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:50.970
And the reason why we feel such
a negative effect from stress

00:21:50.970 --> 00:21:53.240
is because stress should
be meaningful, right?

00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:55.719
If I tell you your inbox is
full of spam, you're like, OK,

00:21:55.719 --> 00:21:56.260
I don't care.

00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:57.781
But if your inbox
is full of things

00:21:57.781 --> 00:21:59.780
you need to get back that
you wanted to get back

00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:01.850
to that are meaningful for
your job or connections

00:22:01.850 --> 00:22:03.724
you want to make, suddenly
you care about it.

00:22:03.724 --> 00:22:07.407
Or if I tell somebody that
somebody's kid is failing

00:22:07.407 --> 00:22:08.740
English, they don't really care.

00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:11.090
If their kid's failing English,
they care a whole bunch.

00:22:11.090 --> 00:22:12.420
Stress has meaning in it.

00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:15.859
But when we separate the energy
from stress from meaning,

00:22:15.859 --> 00:22:17.900
that's when we get these
negative health effects.

00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:19.790
So what we found is we can
actually train people out

00:22:19.790 --> 00:22:21.540
of these ideas,
which is incredible.

00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:25.210
So all we have to do is deepen
somebody's social connection,

00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:28.339
change their optimism, or change
the way that they view stress,

00:22:28.339 --> 00:22:30.380
and we can actually improve
every single business

00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:33.790
and educational outcome
worldwide, which is incredible.

00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:35.940
CHADE-MENG TAN: Lovely.

00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:38.424
Your first book, that really
spoke to me on one level.

00:22:38.424 --> 00:22:40.590
Because when you talk about
the happiness advantage,

00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:45.220
like happiness before
success, I reflect on my life.

00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:47.380
And for me, I'm a meditator.

00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:49.120
I've been doing it 20 years.

00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:52.890
And if your meditation
practice is deep enough,

00:22:52.890 --> 00:22:55.100
you get into a
state where you are

00:22:55.100 --> 00:23:00.870
happy independent of
sensations and thoughts.

00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:02.590
You are just happy.

00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:05.550
And then everything you
experience is bonus.

00:23:05.550 --> 00:23:07.750
And then I found that
when I'm consistently

00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:11.650
in that from of mind I
became even more successful.

00:23:11.650 --> 00:23:16.040
And what you gave me was the
vocabulary and the research

00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:18.020
to understand this
whole experience.

00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:20.665
So I'm really grateful
to you for that.

00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:27.270
So for me, I decided to
dedicate my life to creating

00:23:27.270 --> 00:23:31.520
the conditions for world
peace by making peace, joy,

00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:33.810
and compassion
universally accessible.

00:23:33.810 --> 00:23:37.020
And I know that's what
you want to do as well.

00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:40.850
And so my question next to
you is, how do you spread it?

00:23:40.850 --> 00:23:42.250
How do spread happiness?

00:23:42.250 --> 00:23:43.506
You and maybe in general.

00:23:43.506 --> 00:23:45.130
How do you spread
happiness in general?

00:23:47.356 --> 00:23:48.730
SHAWN ACHOR: Well,
we're actually

00:23:48.730 --> 00:23:51.490
helped out by our brains.

00:23:51.490 --> 00:23:53.910
One of the things that I've
found so incredible in some

00:23:53.910 --> 00:23:59.250
of this research that's coming
out is one of the experiments

00:23:59.250 --> 00:24:02.900
that I have people do
in some of my talks--

00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:05.719
which actually we can do
it right now, if you want.

00:24:05.719 --> 00:24:06.760
Let's do it real quickly.

00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:08.926
So you don't have to do any
of my experiments today.

00:24:08.926 --> 00:24:11.940
I'm not allowed to bring
consent forms to talks,

00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:15.540
because we had an electric shock
problem a couple years ago.

00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:17.290
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]

00:24:17.290 --> 00:24:18.110
SHAWN ACHOR: But here's
what I need you to do.

00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:19.080
And you can do
this even if you're

00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:20.785
watching from a remote location.

00:24:20.785 --> 00:24:23.060
All I need you to do is
just partner up with someone

00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:24.185
that's sitting next to you.

00:24:24.185 --> 00:24:26.132
Partner up into pairs of two.

00:24:26.132 --> 00:24:27.090
Of course pairs of two.

00:24:27.090 --> 00:24:28.140
Partner up into pairs.

00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:31.119
The only caveat is legally I'm
required to tell you you cannot

00:24:31.119 --> 00:24:33.410
partner up with someone that
you're married to for this

00:24:33.410 --> 00:24:35.860
experiment or that you
want to be married to.

00:24:35.860 --> 00:24:38.469
So move around if you're
struggling with this.

00:24:38.469 --> 00:24:40.010
CHADE-MENG TAN: You
know who you are.

00:24:40.010 --> 00:24:41.093
SHAWN ACHOR: Yes, exactly.

00:24:41.093 --> 00:24:42.840
So does everyone have a partner?

00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:45.360
You can move closer, because
you need to sit next to them.

00:24:52.610 --> 00:24:54.370
So here's what I need you to do.

00:24:54.370 --> 00:24:56.500
The person that's sitting
closest to this wall,

00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:58.790
to the exits is your person
number one in the pair.

00:24:58.790 --> 00:24:59.820
The person furthest
from that wall,

00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:01.361
you're person number
two in the pair.

00:25:01.361 --> 00:25:04.981
If you're remote, just pick
one person to be number one.

00:25:04.981 --> 00:25:06.480
Some of you are
like, I already knew

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:08.360
I was person number
one in this pair.

00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:10.830
There should be a two
and a one in each group.

00:25:10.830 --> 00:25:13.475
So raise your hand if
you're person number one.

00:25:13.475 --> 00:25:15.330
Raise your hand if
you're person number two.

00:25:15.330 --> 00:25:15.830
OK.

00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:16.930
That's not the experiment.

00:25:16.930 --> 00:25:17.809
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]

00:25:17.809 --> 00:25:19.100
SHAWN ACHOR: I have to do that.

00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:21.110
Because I did this experiment
on Wall Street a couple months

00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:23.550
ago, and it literally took that
struggling bank five minutes

00:25:23.550 --> 00:25:25.466
to figure out who number
one in the group was.

00:25:25.466 --> 00:25:26.507
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]

00:25:26.507 --> 00:25:28.590
SHAWN ACHOR: Which explains
what's going on there.

00:25:28.590 --> 00:25:30.464
So here's what I need you to do.

00:25:30.464 --> 00:25:32.880
How many of you, by the way,
have a psychology background,

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:35.370
read a lot of psychology
books, studied psychology?

00:25:35.370 --> 00:25:35.870
OK.

00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:37.710
So for my psychology
friends, this

00:25:37.710 --> 00:25:40.167
is the emotional prime
of the experiment.

00:25:40.167 --> 00:25:41.625
For everyone else,
this is nothing.

00:25:41.625 --> 00:25:42.790
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]

00:25:42.790 --> 00:25:44.230
SHAWN ACHOR: But here's
what we ask you to do.

00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:45.290
Over the course of
your life, you've

00:25:45.290 --> 00:25:47.249
taken your genes, your
genetic predispositions,

00:25:47.249 --> 00:25:49.790
you've beat both those genes
out through your self-discipline

00:25:49.790 --> 00:25:50.920
and your self-control.

00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:52.580
You were able to pass the
classes that you needed to

00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:54.130
in school to get
into the schools

00:25:54.130 --> 00:25:56.620
you wanted to to apply yourself
to your job here at Google.

00:25:56.620 --> 00:25:58.466
What I'd love for
you to do is to use

00:25:58.466 --> 00:26:00.090
all of that
self-discipline and control

00:26:00.090 --> 00:26:01.850
that you've been
cultivating for decades,

00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:04.350
and I'd like you to use it to
control your behavior for just

00:26:04.350 --> 00:26:06.329
seven seconds of this
experiment, if you can.

00:26:06.329 --> 00:26:07.870
At eight seconds,
you can do whatever

00:26:07.870 --> 00:26:09.662
you want to or
with your partner.

00:26:09.662 --> 00:26:11.120
But for seven
seconds, you're mine.

00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:15.330
So what we ask you do in this
experiment, person number one,

00:26:15.330 --> 00:26:17.254
is to not get angry
with person number

00:26:17.254 --> 00:26:19.170

what I'm about to tell

00:26:19.170 --> 00:26:19.920
them to do to you.

are going to do nothing
with person number two.

So person number one and
two, please turn and face

00:26:39.970 --> 00:26:40.460
one another.

make sure you're

00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:43.476

go neutral on the inside.

and try and think

00:26:52.150 --> 00:26:53.566
no thoughts, which
for some of you

00:26:53.566 --> 00:26:55.080
might be extremely
easy right now.

00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:56.430
Then control your hands,
person number one.

00:26:56.430 --> 00:26:58.470
Don't move your hands
even to defend yourself

00:26:58.470 --> 00:26:59.760
from person number two.

00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:04.190
And person number one,
just control your face.

No fear, no flinching, no
frustration, zero emotion.

Once you're ready,

form of deception in it,

but just switch it around.

we know at this point,

00:28:00.233 --> 00:28:01.920
for person number to
control themselves.

neutral on the inside.

00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:05.640
Using your self-discipline
and control

00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:07.931

successful than person number

control yourself.

one, look at them.

it's your turn for retaliation.

[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]

00:28:31.959 --> 00:28:34.000
SHAWN ACHOR: So what I
love about this experiment

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:35.550
is even if you're
successful at it,

00:28:35.550 --> 00:28:37.940
as soon as you say stop
people relax as if that was

00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:41.680
the hardest thing they had to
do all day, which literally was

00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:43.860
doing nothing for
the seven seconds.

00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:45.860
But first of all, I'm
just curious in this room,

00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:48.006
it's a quiet room, so it's hard.

00:28:48.006 --> 00:28:49.380
This experiment
works much better

00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:51.070
if you've got more
priming going on.

00:28:51.070 --> 00:28:53.830
But I'm just curious,
failure at this experiment

00:28:53.830 --> 00:28:55.740
means you smiled when
I asked you not to,

00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:57.220
and success means that
you did not smile.

00:28:57.220 --> 00:28:59.678
Raise your hand if you failed
miserably at this by smiling.

00:28:59.678 --> 00:29:00.810
Oh, OK.

00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:03.652
That's terrible.

00:29:03.652 --> 00:29:05.110
Raise your hand if
you successfully

00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:08.470
did what I asked you to
for the full seven seconds.

00:29:08.470 --> 00:29:14.870
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,

00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:15.370
18.

00:29:15.370 --> 00:29:16.745
18 liars.

00:29:16.745 --> 00:29:19.070
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]

00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:21.090
SHAWN ACHOR: What we find is--

00:29:21.090 --> 00:29:22.340
CHADE-MENG TAN: Pants on fire.

00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:23.822
SHAWN ACHOR: Exactly.

00:29:23.822 --> 00:29:25.530
Actually, I don't know
why I counted you,

00:29:25.530 --> 00:29:27.738
because I don't know how
many people are in the room.

00:29:27.738 --> 00:29:30.451
But what we find is 80% to
85% of people worldwide cannot

00:29:30.451 --> 00:29:32.950
control themselves for the seven
seconds of this experiment.

00:29:32.950 --> 00:29:34.950
I did this with senior-level
bankers, all men,

00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:37.520
all in their mid-50s
in Tokyo, Japan,

00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:39.550
and the smile
percentage was 77%.

00:29:39.550 --> 00:29:43.840
What we're finding is
it's extremely universal.

00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:48.020
You mentioned I've been
to over 50 countries,

00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:50.380
and I've done this
experiment in all of them.

00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:51.820
But one I made a mistake with.

00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:53.870
And this gets directly
back your question.

00:29:53.870 --> 00:29:56.820
But I wanted to
tell you about this.

00:29:56.820 --> 00:30:02.390
So last year I got invited by
the royal family in Abu Dhabi,

00:30:02.390 --> 00:30:04.800
as one does, to get to
give a talk on happiness.

00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:07.840
And I was so excited
about this opportunity

00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:10.349
that I went over there and was
meeting all of these people

00:30:10.349 --> 00:30:12.640
that I'd never met before
and been to a place I'd never

00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:14.977
had that I wasn't thinking
when I got into the talk,

00:30:14.977 --> 00:30:16.060
because I was too excited.

00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:18.780
And one of the talks there was
for 300 women in the Middle

00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:21.150
East about how we can raise
up levels of happiness

00:30:21.150 --> 00:30:22.620
and positive leadership there.

00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:23.390
And some of you are
smiling because you

00:30:23.390 --> 00:30:24.610
know the mistake I made.

00:30:24.610 --> 00:30:28.210
I tried the smiling experiment
in the talk and only

00:30:28.210 --> 00:30:30.420
halfway through realized
that 90% of the room

00:30:30.420 --> 00:30:32.742
was veiled for the
smiling experiment, which

00:30:32.742 --> 00:30:35.200
had I thought it before I would
not have made that mistake.

00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:38.410
But I'm so grateful I did,
because the women in the room

00:30:38.410 --> 00:30:39.310
taught me something.

00:30:39.310 --> 00:30:41.410
They told me that
the experiment still

00:30:41.410 --> 00:30:43.950
worked because they could see
the smile in the other woman's

00:30:43.950 --> 00:30:44.660
eyes.

00:30:44.660 --> 00:30:47.130
And even behind the veil,
the smile was contagious.

00:30:47.130 --> 00:30:49.590
The reason why this is so
fascinating is what we found

00:30:49.590 --> 00:30:53.989
is inside the human brain, what
we discovered also by accident

00:30:53.989 --> 00:30:56.280
is over the past 15 years
we've discovered these things

00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:58.300
in the human brain
called mirror neurons.

00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:00.580
So if you put me into
a fMRI brain scan,

00:31:00.580 --> 00:31:02.889
scan my brain while I'm
smiling, parts of my brain

00:31:02.889 --> 00:31:04.930
will show activation
telling me that I'm smiling.

00:31:04.930 --> 00:31:06.860
But if I stop
smiling, which is what

00:31:06.860 --> 00:31:09.500
you were just trying to do,
and someone smiles at you

00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:11.970
or you see a picture
of somebody smiling,

00:31:11.970 --> 00:31:13.700
those small parts
of your brain called

00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:16.525
mirror neurons will
show activation,

00:31:16.525 --> 00:31:18.740
and they'll tell you you're
the one that's smiling.

00:31:18.740 --> 00:31:23.970
And your motor neurons
will cause your face

00:31:23.970 --> 00:31:26.560
to contort into a smile
before you can stop yourself,

00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:29.597
because you already
think you're smiling.

00:31:29.597 --> 00:31:31.180
So if you were looking
at your partner

00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:32.846
and their lips were
quivering while they

00:31:32.846 --> 00:31:35.330
were trying not to
smile, that's weird.

00:31:35.330 --> 00:31:36.242
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]

00:31:36.242 --> 00:31:37.950
SHAWN ACHOR: That
shouldn't be happening.

00:31:37.950 --> 00:31:40.372
But what's occurring there
is their mirror neurons

00:31:40.372 --> 00:31:42.080
are fighting against
their motor neurons.

00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:43.470
Your brain already
thinks you're smiling,

00:31:43.470 --> 00:31:44.500
so it's like, what's
the problem here,

00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:46.510
face, as your brain
is trying to find out

00:31:46.510 --> 00:31:47.770
what's going on between those.

00:31:47.770 --> 00:31:48.770
These happen with yawns.

00:31:48.770 --> 00:31:51.630
So if you see somebody yawn,
our likelihood of yawning

00:31:51.630 --> 00:31:53.130
increases because
our brain actually

00:31:53.130 --> 00:31:54.450
tells we're the
one that's yawning.

00:31:54.450 --> 00:31:56.170
But why this is so
fascinating and why

00:31:56.170 --> 00:31:58.540
this is crucial to
this contagious effect

00:31:58.540 --> 00:32:01.490
that we can have is it
turns out that if you

00:32:01.490 --> 00:32:05.534
have 15 strangers waiting for
a plane-- they don't even know

00:32:05.534 --> 00:32:06.700
they're part experiment yet.

00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:08.160
They're just at an
airport-- and you

00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:09.630
introduce an
undercover researcher,

00:32:09.630 --> 00:32:12.580
a confederate to stand in
the middle of the 15 people

00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:15.370
and bounce nervously in place,
tap his foot on the floor

00:32:15.370 --> 00:32:18.220
and look at his watch repeatedly
with a frown on his face,

00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:20.740
within two minutes of waiting
for that plane or train,

00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:24.420
depending on the study, 7 to
12 of the 15 individuals will

00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:26.680
unconsciously start
bouncing nervously in place

00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:28.487
and/or tapping their
foot on the ground

00:32:28.487 --> 00:32:30.570
and/or looking at their
watch more than four times

00:32:30.570 --> 00:32:31.220
in two minutes.

00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:32.720
If you don't believe
me, this is one

00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:34.670
of the experiments
you can do yourself

00:32:34.670 --> 00:32:36.606
the next time you
get on a plain,

00:32:36.606 --> 00:32:38.480
if you want to spread
stress and negativity--

[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]

people on your plane,

00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:42.610
which is why do this
at a different gate.

00:32:42.610 --> 00:32:44.235
But the reason I love
this experiment--

00:32:44.235 --> 00:32:45.050
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]

00:32:45.050 --> 00:32:47.383
SHAWN ACHOR: --is it shows
this, that not only do smiles

00:32:47.383 --> 00:32:49.980
and yawns spread, it turns
out negativity, stress,

00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:53.450
uncertainty, pessimism we can
pick up like secondhand smoke.

00:32:53.450 --> 00:32:54.950
You can be optimistic,
but if you're

00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:56.440
surrounded by people
who are negative,

00:32:56.440 --> 00:32:58.330
your brain through these
mirror neurons can pick it up.

00:32:58.330 --> 00:33:00.400
And when we tell people
that, they're like, OK.

00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:02.050
Well, here are the people
I'm cutting out of my life.

00:33:02.050 --> 00:33:03.841
I'm not going to hang
out with this person.

00:33:03.841 --> 00:33:05.990
I'm going to de-friend
them on Facebook.

00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:09.034
I'm not even going to look
at this person anymore, which

00:33:09.034 --> 00:33:10.700
is awkward because
they're in my family.

00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:13.070
And what happens is in
each one of those moments

00:33:13.070 --> 00:33:14.640
we're eliminating
social connection.

00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:16.540
But these mirror neurons
give us the power

00:33:16.540 --> 00:33:19.307
to actually spread positive
change even better.

00:33:19.307 --> 00:33:20.765
Because as we've
been studying you,

00:33:20.765 --> 00:33:22.240
we've been studying you wrong.

00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:24.330
There's no wires
connecting your brains.

00:33:24.330 --> 00:33:25.589
There's no organic material.

00:33:25.589 --> 00:33:27.130
So we've made the
mistake of assuming

00:33:27.130 --> 00:33:29.965
that all of your brains were
separate, and they're not.

00:33:29.965 --> 00:33:33.020
It misses out on how beautiful
the human organism actually

00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:35.820
is, because our brains
are not wired together.

00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:38.380
Our brains are
wirelessly connected

00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:39.962
through a mirror neuron network.

00:33:39.962 --> 00:33:42.170
Your thoughts right now are
changing your nonverbals,

00:33:42.170 --> 00:33:44.764
how you're sitting here, which
is changing the way that people

00:33:44.764 --> 00:33:46.930
sitting next to you are
processing this information.

00:33:46.930 --> 00:33:49.680
We're in a continual
feedback loop with the people

00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:51.240
that we walk past
in the cafeteria.

00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:53.090
We're in a continual
feedback loop

00:33:53.090 --> 00:33:54.839
with our family members
and our friends.

00:33:54.839 --> 00:33:56.380
And what we found
is if we can buffer

00:33:56.380 --> 00:33:59.420
our brain against the
negative, if we can create even

00:33:59.420 --> 00:34:03.270
a single positive change in
our life, meditation, exercise,

00:34:03.270 --> 00:34:05.010
gratitude, whatever
it is you're doing,

00:34:05.010 --> 00:34:07.050
we can actually watch
that positive effect

00:34:07.050 --> 00:34:09.840
that's occurring in your
brain wirelessly impact

00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:12.630
the people's brains of
the people around you.

00:34:12.630 --> 00:34:14.449
One of the opportunities
I got last year

00:34:14.449 --> 00:34:16.692
was to work at a hospital.

00:34:16.692 --> 00:34:18.150
And hospitals have
a terrible time,

00:34:18.150 --> 00:34:19.733
because when you
think about hospitals

00:34:19.733 --> 00:34:21.639
you think about sickness
and disease, Right?

00:34:21.639 --> 00:34:22.722
And you can't change that.

00:34:22.722 --> 00:34:24.234
But we went into
the Ritz Carlton

00:34:24.234 --> 00:34:25.650
to figure out what
they were doing

00:34:25.650 --> 00:34:27.273
to get people to
love coming there.

00:34:27.273 --> 00:34:28.814
And they have nice
buildings, but one

00:34:28.814 --> 00:34:30.010
of the things that
the train-- maybe you

00:34:30.010 --> 00:34:32.210
know this-- they teach
them to do something

00:34:32.210 --> 00:34:33.719
called the 10-5
Way, which is if you

00:34:33.719 --> 00:34:36.002
walk within 10 feet of
somebody at a Ritz Carlton,

00:34:36.002 --> 00:34:38.210
they're trained to make eye
contact and smile at you.

00:34:38.210 --> 00:34:41.090
And within 5 feet, the employees
are trained to say hello.

00:34:41.090 --> 00:34:42.810
It's actually really
fun to go in and out

00:34:42.810 --> 00:34:45.235
of those sphere with
them at the Ritz,

00:34:45.235 --> 00:34:46.610
even if you're
not staying there.

00:34:46.610 --> 00:34:48.151
But what we love
about the experience

00:34:48.151 --> 00:34:50.400
is that we could import
it down to this hospital,

00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:51.800
to these groups of hospitals.

00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:54.250
And we trained them
post-Katrina down in Louisiana.

00:34:54.250 --> 00:34:56.250
And some of the doctors
were like, why would you

00:34:56.250 --> 00:34:58.370
have to train people to smile?

00:34:58.370 --> 00:34:59.970
Isn't that human nature?

00:34:59.970 --> 00:35:02.820
But then other doctors
were like, uh, you

00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:04.220
hired me to save people's lives.

00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:06.874
It doesn't matter how I
walked down the hallways.

00:35:06.874 --> 00:35:07.790
I save people's lives.

00:35:07.790 --> 00:35:08.470
That's what I'm hired for.

00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:11.230
I'm not going to do this stupid
smiling initiative from HR.

00:35:11.230 --> 00:35:12.370
So we said, that's fine.

00:35:12.370 --> 00:35:14.740
But then we trained
11,000 of their coworkers

00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:17.690
to make eye contact and
smile and to do the 10-5 Way.

00:35:17.690 --> 00:35:20.240
And what happens is
everyone started picking up

00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:22.540
the pattern, the doctors,
and nurses, the staff.

00:35:22.540 --> 00:35:24.320
But the cool part
was the patients,

00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:25.810
who didn't know
what was going on,

00:35:25.810 --> 00:35:28.750
picked up and then started
initiating the social script,

00:35:28.750 --> 00:35:31.710
because they were learning that
when I walk down this hallway

00:35:31.710 --> 00:35:35.755
I'm supposed to treat people
as if they're human beings.

00:35:35.755 --> 00:35:37.380
We pick up social
scripts all the time.

00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:42.080
If you get onto subway in
New York or The T in Boston,

00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:43.690
you start smiling,
some people start

00:35:43.690 --> 00:35:45.020
moving away from you, right?

00:35:45.020 --> 00:35:46.720
Because we know
the social script.

00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:48.380
Let's not necessarily
do eye contact,

00:35:48.380 --> 00:35:50.210
and let's not actually
smile at strangers.

00:35:50.210 --> 00:35:51.910
We know that rule.

00:35:51.910 --> 00:35:54.714
But part of what we
were finding was not

00:35:54.714 --> 00:35:56.130
only did hospital
hallways change,

00:35:56.130 --> 00:35:58.890
which would be a cute story
about how hospitals can change,

00:35:58.890 --> 00:36:00.879
what I was interested
in is what happened

00:36:00.879 --> 00:36:02.670
six months later to
their business outcome.

00:36:02.670 --> 00:36:05.550
Six months later, the
hospitals that did this,

00:36:05.550 --> 00:36:09.890
they saw a significant increase
in their unique patients

00:36:09.890 --> 00:36:11.062
that came to the hospital.

00:36:11.062 --> 00:36:12.520
The likelihood of
patients to refer

00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:15.400
the care, the quality of care
that they received skyrocketed.

00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:17.390
And the doctors'
happiness level at work

00:36:17.390 --> 00:36:19.430
were the highest not only
in the hospital chain

00:36:19.430 --> 00:36:21.800
but in a decade at
that organization.

00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:23.750
That's a one-second
behavioral change

00:36:23.750 --> 00:36:26.620
that shows we can change the
social script around this

00:36:26.620 --> 00:36:29.140
and actually impact not only
our happiness but the quality

00:36:29.140 --> 00:36:31.990
of care that we provide
and our business outcomes.

00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:35.372
My question-- and it's the one
that you have been championing

00:36:35.372 --> 00:36:37.705
here at Google-- is, what if
we had more than one second

00:36:37.705 --> 00:36:38.730
with somebody?

00:36:38.730 --> 00:36:40.940
What if we could change
somebody not just short-term?

00:36:40.940 --> 00:36:43.023
But what if we could
actually change the very lens

00:36:43.023 --> 00:36:44.510
with which we viewed the world?

00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:47.280
And that's where things become
really powerful, I think.

00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:48.450
CHADE-MENG TAN: I have
a suggestion for that--

00:36:48.450 --> 00:36:48.840
SHAWN ACHOR: Yes.

00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:50.330
CHADE-MENG TAN: --wish
is to look at human being

00:36:50.330 --> 00:36:52.500
and to think, I wish for
this person to be happy.

00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:54.580
You don't have to
do or say anything.

00:36:54.580 --> 00:36:55.820
Just think.

00:36:55.820 --> 00:36:59.220
And that thought alone
changes everything.

00:36:59.220 --> 00:37:01.510
Because it changes
your facial expression,

00:37:01.510 --> 00:37:04.750
changes your behavior,
and eventually people,

00:37:04.750 --> 00:37:07.180
they like each other, and
they don't really know why.

00:37:07.180 --> 00:37:08.880
This operates on an
unconscious level.

00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:09.630
SHAWN ACHOR: Yeah.

00:37:09.630 --> 00:37:11.130
CHADE-MENG TAN: So I
suggest that to everybody,

00:37:11.130 --> 00:37:11.840
that one thought.

00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:13.910
I wish for this guy to be happy.

00:37:13.910 --> 00:37:15.260
And then leave it at that.

00:37:15.260 --> 00:37:16.490
See what happens.

00:37:16.490 --> 00:37:17.820
SHAWN ACHOR: That's cool.

00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:20.190
CHADE-MENG TAN: Oh, I love
how you say it's beautiful.

00:37:20.190 --> 00:37:21.600
I see it, and I raise you one--

00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:22.020
SHAWN ACHOR: OK.

00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:22.780
CHADE-MENG TAN:
--which is I think

00:37:22.780 --> 00:37:24.860
that in addition
happiness is contagious.

00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:28.550
The other thing I found to
be contagious is calmness.

00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:32.370
If you walk into a room in
a meditative, calm state,

00:37:32.370 --> 00:37:34.480
no matter how bad things
are, if you walk in

00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:38.080
and sit down meditatively
calm, it starts to spread.

00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:39.840
People start calming down.

00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:41.660
So for those of you
who are meditators,

00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:47.990
practice that in a meeting
where things are not going well.

00:37:47.990 --> 00:37:49.110
Give that a try.

00:37:49.110 --> 00:37:50.750
See if you can change anything.

00:37:50.750 --> 00:37:52.470
And sometimes people notice.

00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:55.836
That guy, every time he walks
in the room, something changes.

00:37:55.836 --> 00:37:56.960
See if that happens to you.

00:37:56.960 --> 00:37:58.001
SHAWN ACHOR: That's cool.

00:37:58.001 --> 00:38:02.040
CHADE-MENG TAN: Which leads
me to the next question.

00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:04.620
The thing I really like
about this book are

00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:07.340
two words that you use,
which I thought was genius.

00:38:07.340 --> 00:38:10.520
And the words you use
are positive genius.

00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:13.920
And can you talk about
what is a positive genius

00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:16.180
and how that relates to
happiness and success?

00:38:16.180 --> 00:38:17.580
SHAWN ACHOR: Sure.

00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:20.870
So only 25% of your
successes here at Google

00:38:20.870 --> 00:38:22.670
are predicted based
upon your intelligence

00:38:22.670 --> 00:38:24.135
and technical skills.

00:38:24.135 --> 00:38:25.690
CHADE-MENG TAN: The rest
is their good looks, right?

00:38:25.690 --> 00:38:27.231
SHAWN ACHOR: The
rest are good looks.

00:38:27.231 --> 00:38:28.280
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]

00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:31.100
SHAWN ACHOR: Which we know from
tech, financials, and medicals,

00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:33.720
where I thought IQ would
matter more, it doesn't.

00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:37.050
About 25% of job success is
predicted by how smart you are.

00:38:37.050 --> 00:38:39.080
75% of your successes
are predicted

00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:41.850
by three other
factors, your optimism,

00:38:41.850 --> 00:38:43.610
the belief that your
behavior matters,

00:38:43.610 --> 00:38:46.710
your social connections, and
the way you perceive stress.

00:38:46.710 --> 00:38:48.710
What we found are that
there's these individuals

00:38:48.710 --> 00:38:51.740
and organizations-- and not
even organizations, nonprofits

00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:56.162
and families-- that we call
positive geniuses, who,

00:38:56.162 --> 00:38:58.620
regardless of the environment
that they find themselves in,

00:38:58.620 --> 00:39:01.810
are able to continually
architect these realities that

00:39:01.810 --> 00:39:04.670
cause them to see past to not
only success but to happiness

00:39:04.670 --> 00:39:06.400
as well.

00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:08.205
Your brains are phenomenal.

00:39:08.205 --> 00:39:09.960
Some of you are like,
yeah, I knew that.

00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:11.050
That's why I work here.

00:39:11.050 --> 00:39:12.780
But your brain can
process about 40 bits

00:39:12.780 --> 00:39:15.170
of information per second,
which is really fast.

00:39:15.170 --> 00:39:17.680
The only problem is your brain
receives 11 million pieces

00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:20.460
of information per second from
all of your nerve endings.

00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:22.670
So as you're constructing
a picture of the world,

00:39:22.670 --> 00:39:26.440
your brain picks and chooses
two to four small facts,

00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:29.010
and then you architect an
entire reality around them.

00:39:29.010 --> 00:39:32.384
And if we know what those
facts are for you, if we

00:39:32.384 --> 00:39:34.800
hear how you're describing
your work or your relationships

00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:37.089
or your life, those facts
you go to immediately,

00:39:37.089 --> 00:39:38.880
those actually predict
not only your levels

00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:40.960
of happiness and
your stress levels

00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:43.610
and how calm you are, but it
predicts your success rates,

00:39:43.610 --> 00:39:46.820
your educational outcomes, your
health outcomes in the future.

00:39:46.820 --> 00:39:49.040
Part of what we found is
that these positive geniuses

00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:52.340
have practiced or have
created these patterns where

00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:55.480
they can continually architect
these positive realities over

00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:56.296
and over again.

00:39:56.296 --> 00:39:57.670
And what I loved
about this is it

00:39:57.670 --> 00:39:59.128
was something that
could be taught.

00:39:59.128 --> 00:40:03.060
I think one of the deepest and
coolest parts of this research

00:40:03.060 --> 00:40:05.270
in positive psychology
is this idea

00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:08.600
that I believe at base is
just that change is possible,

00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:11.840
which I actually think
most people would give

00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:14.125
lip service to but don't
actually believe that.

00:40:14.125 --> 00:40:17.150
Because I think most people
think that just their genes

00:40:17.150 --> 00:40:19.442
are their environment,
that that person's happy

00:40:19.442 --> 00:40:20.650
because they were born happy.

00:40:20.650 --> 00:40:24.550
Or I'm happy because
I was born optimistic

00:40:24.550 --> 00:40:26.285
or my parents were
optimistic, and that's

00:40:26.285 --> 00:40:27.160
the end of the story.

00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:29.910
Or there are some people
that are pessimistic as well.

00:40:29.910 --> 00:40:33.160
There is a researcher up in
Minnesota who's studying twins.

00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:35.280
And they found if you
take identical twins

00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:37.115
and raise them apart--
they were already

00:40:37.115 --> 00:40:38.734
going to be raised apart.

00:40:38.734 --> 00:40:40.150
They didn't do
that for the study,

00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:43.600
but that they have
identical twins raised

00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:46.940
different families, different
environment, same genes,

00:40:46.940 --> 00:40:49.499
and what they found is,
on average, the levels

00:40:49.499 --> 00:40:50.790
of happiness were very similar.

00:40:50.790 --> 00:40:53.570
So he concluded 80% of
your long-term happiness

00:40:53.570 --> 00:40:56.140
is based upon your
genes, which actually I

00:40:56.140 --> 00:40:57.864
believe most people believe.

00:40:57.864 --> 00:40:59.530
They think the majority
of our happiness

00:40:59.530 --> 00:41:03.304
is based upon the way your brain
was wired from the beginning.

00:41:03.304 --> 00:41:04.720
And if you believe
that statement,

00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:06.440
you have to believe
the next one, which

00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:08.310
is his famous statement.

00:41:08.310 --> 00:41:10.660
Stop trying to change
your happiness.

00:41:10.660 --> 00:41:12.530
You're as likely to
change your happiness

00:41:12.530 --> 00:41:14.800
as to change your
height, which is also

00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:16.497
80% determined by genes.

00:41:16.497 --> 00:41:18.830
He's since recanted that
statement, because it turns out

00:41:18.830 --> 00:41:20.580
he was only half right,
which in this case

00:41:20.580 --> 00:41:22.370
makes him fully wrong.

00:41:22.370 --> 00:41:24.865
Because genes do set
the initial baseline.

00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:29.580
We can shine a light
at a three-day-old,

00:41:29.580 --> 00:41:32.372
and if they turn towards that
light and that auditory click,

00:41:32.372 --> 00:41:34.580
they're trying to increase
their neocortical arousal,

00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:37.012
and they're more likely to
be an extrovert at age 10.

00:41:37.012 --> 00:41:38.470
They turn away from
it, and they're

00:41:38.470 --> 00:41:39.922
more likely to be an introvert.

00:41:39.922 --> 00:41:40.630
That's day three.

00:41:40.630 --> 00:41:42.838
We haven't even had time to
screw them up yet, right?

00:41:42.838 --> 00:41:45.070
They've got these
predispositions for this.

00:41:45.070 --> 00:41:46.990
Some of you,
genetically happiness

00:41:46.990 --> 00:41:49.330
is a much easier choice
than it is for other people.

00:41:49.330 --> 00:41:51.970
Same thing with obesity,
with alcoholism,

00:41:51.970 --> 00:41:53.620
all of these different
types of things.

00:41:53.620 --> 00:41:55.750
But that's only the
beginning of the story.

00:41:55.750 --> 00:41:58.940
The reason why we keep finding
genes to be so important

00:41:58.940 --> 00:42:02.977
is that average person
doesn't fight their genes.

00:42:02.977 --> 00:42:05.560
And if you've seen my TED Talk,
one of the things I talk about

00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:07.477
is how most of
our research we're

00:42:07.477 --> 00:42:08.560
interested in the average.

00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:10.851
We want to find out how many
aspirin the average person

00:42:10.851 --> 00:42:12.690
should take if they
get a headache, which

00:42:12.690 --> 00:42:14.023
we should already see a problem.

00:42:14.023 --> 00:42:17.240
Because regardless if you're
90 pounds or 250 pounds, yeah,

00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:19.940
about two pills should do it.

00:42:19.940 --> 00:42:22.090
But as soon as we ask
questions about potential,

00:42:22.090 --> 00:42:24.820
about happiness, about
optimism, about success,

00:42:24.820 --> 00:42:27.352
those are a different
group of questions.

00:42:27.352 --> 00:42:29.310
And when we ask questions
like that, what we do

00:42:29.310 --> 00:42:31.090
is we create a cult
of the average.

00:42:31.090 --> 00:42:33.280
Because if we ask questions
like, how fast can

00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:35.769
a child learn how to
read?-- and in our research,

00:42:35.769 --> 00:42:37.810
we changed it to, how fast
does the average child

00:42:37.810 --> 00:42:40.000
learn how to read, and then
we tailor the classes right

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:40.874
towards that average.

00:42:40.874 --> 00:42:42.200
Same thing with genes.

00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:45.020
If we look at how much genes
matter, we look at the average,

00:42:45.020 --> 00:42:47.174
and the average
person does not fight

00:42:47.174 --> 00:42:48.590
their genes and
their environment.

00:42:48.590 --> 00:42:51.048
But if you look at those same
graphs with those same twins,

00:42:51.048 --> 00:42:53.680
we find that they can
scatter dramatically

00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:56.500
from their genetic set point
and from our environment.

00:42:56.500 --> 00:42:59.650
Only 10% of your long-term
levels of happiness

00:42:59.650 --> 00:43:01.800
are predicted based
upon the external world.

00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:03.880
90% of your long-term
levels of happiness

00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:07.410
is predicted by how your brain
processes that external world.

00:43:07.410 --> 00:43:09.850
And one of the things we found--
and there might be people

00:43:09.850 --> 00:43:12.380
here in the room, you've
seen a change in your life.

00:43:12.380 --> 00:43:15.472
You've actually seen how you've
become more optimistic or more

00:43:15.472 --> 00:43:17.930
jaded in your life, whatever
direction you've been going on

00:43:17.930 --> 00:43:21.160
that trajectory-- I was
telling you this morning,

00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:24.730
I had an identical twin come
up to me after one of my talks

00:43:24.730 --> 00:43:29.200
and she said, I used to be
a very negative person, just

00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:32.030
like my sister, but now
I'm extremely positive.

00:43:32.030 --> 00:43:33.230
I'm like, that's amazing.

00:43:33.230 --> 00:43:34.310
What did you do?

00:43:34.310 --> 00:43:36.280
How did you break that
cycle from your genes?

00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:37.370
That's what I study.

00:43:37.370 --> 00:43:40.130
And she thought about it,
and she was like, actually,

00:43:40.130 --> 00:43:42.170
I think it happened
when I was 15.

00:43:42.170 --> 00:43:45.960
I was involved in a horrific
car accident, and I almost died.

00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:49.112
And I realized that
life was a privilege

00:43:49.112 --> 00:43:50.820
and that I had a whole
new lease on life.

00:43:50.820 --> 00:43:53.010
And from then on,
I've seen the world

00:43:53.010 --> 00:43:54.360
in a completely different way.

00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:58.620
What I love about that is that's
a trauma that caused growth.

00:43:58.620 --> 00:44:00.420
It wasn't just
post-traumatic stress,

00:44:00.420 --> 00:44:01.690
which is all we hear about.

00:44:01.690 --> 00:44:04.610
But actually, it was trauma
that caused somebody to not only

00:44:04.610 --> 00:44:08.130
grow, create post-traumatic
growth but a deviation

00:44:08.130 --> 00:44:09.010
from our genes.

00:44:09.010 --> 00:44:11.910
And that is what I find that
these positive geniuses are

00:44:11.910 --> 00:44:15.100
able to do is to realize
that they can actually

00:44:15.100 --> 00:44:17.470
be co-creators of the
lens with which they view

00:44:17.470 --> 00:44:19.940
the world with their
environment and their genes,

00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:22.930
so much so we can get people
with genes for pessimism

00:44:22.930 --> 00:44:26.590
to act in the world and to
become high-level optimists.

00:44:26.590 --> 00:44:28.360
We actually haven't
found anyone who

00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:30.316
is not capable of
changing if they're

00:44:30.316 --> 00:44:32.690
willing to be able to make
some of these positive changes

00:44:32.690 --> 00:44:34.414
within their life,
which shows us

00:44:34.414 --> 00:44:36.830
that if we just push against
our environment and our genes

00:44:36.830 --> 00:44:38.790
and create some of
these positive habits

00:44:38.790 --> 00:44:41.549
that you've been doing here
at Google and the programs

00:44:41.549 --> 00:44:43.340
where you get people
to create these ideas,

00:44:43.340 --> 00:44:46.331
if you take advantage of some
of the exercise equipment

00:44:46.331 --> 00:44:48.080
and all of the incredible
things you have,

00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:51.575
you can actually get people to
change from their genetic set

00:44:51.575 --> 00:44:53.996
point and create a whole new
trajectory, which is amazing.

00:44:53.996 --> 00:44:54.870
CHADE-MENG TAN: Yeah.

00:44:54.870 --> 00:44:55.790
Thank you.

00:44:55.790 --> 00:44:58.100
So Alex has the mic.

00:44:58.100 --> 00:45:00.232
Let's get some questions
from the audience.

00:45:00.232 --> 00:45:02.440
Yeah, Alex, you get to choose
who to give the mic to.

00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:03.979
He has the power.

00:45:03.979 --> 00:45:04.520
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:45:04.520 --> 00:45:06.890
A direct follow-up to
what you just said.

00:45:06.890 --> 00:45:10.870
I grew up with the
quote 10% of the world

00:45:10.870 --> 00:45:13.980
is what you make
of it, and 90% is

00:45:13.980 --> 00:45:16.600
how you take it, which is
kind of what you just said.

00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:18.210
You said 90% of
your happiness is

00:45:18.210 --> 00:45:20.902
based on how you process
your external world.

00:45:20.902 --> 00:45:23.694
Do you have some
scientific fact?

00:45:23.694 --> 00:45:25.110
How did you come
up with that 90%?

00:45:25.110 --> 00:45:27.860
Because before I thought
that that was made up.

00:45:27.860 --> 00:45:29.070
SHAWN ACHOR: Yeah.

00:45:29.070 --> 00:45:31.000
That research comes
from a researcher

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:32.300
named Sonja Lyubomirsky.

00:45:32.300 --> 00:45:34.380
And part of what they
were looking at initially

00:45:34.380 --> 00:45:37.450
was if we know your
external world,

00:45:37.450 --> 00:45:40.240
we can predict short-term
happiness very easily.

00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:42.150
If a stock goes
down, your happiness

00:45:42.150 --> 00:45:43.970
goes down, unless
you short the stock.

00:45:43.970 --> 00:45:47.410
Or if something
bad happens to you,

00:45:47.410 --> 00:45:49.890
immediately you have
a response period.

00:45:49.890 --> 00:45:53.000
If you don't actually have a
response period completely,

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:56.220
sometimes that can
actually be problematic.

00:45:56.220 --> 00:45:58.790
I don't study people that
are happy all the time,

00:45:58.790 --> 00:46:03.200
because that can actually be a
form of a disorder where they

00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:03.780
don't--

00:46:03.780 --> 00:46:04.940
CHADE-MENG TAN: Or
they live in Colorado.

00:46:04.940 --> 00:46:05.815
SHAWN ACHOR: Exactly.

00:46:05.815 --> 00:46:12.695
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]

00:46:12.695 --> 00:46:14.070
SHAWN ACHOR: So
anyway, what they

00:46:14.070 --> 00:46:22.060
found was your happiness levels
in aggregate over time, which

00:46:22.060 --> 00:46:25.240
is when we watch your
patterns move, only 10% of it

00:46:25.240 --> 00:46:27.670
was predicted by any of
those external factors

00:46:27.670 --> 00:46:28.830
that we were looking for.

00:46:28.830 --> 00:46:30.413
So the rest of it
had to be determined

00:46:30.413 --> 00:46:33.594
based upon your genes and what
she calls the voluntary actions

00:46:33.594 --> 00:46:34.510
you make in your life.

00:46:34.510 --> 00:46:36.962
Those are the habits.

00:46:36.962 --> 00:46:38.420
I like where she's
going with this,

00:46:38.420 --> 00:46:40.386
and it's helpful sometimes
to say those things.

00:46:40.386 --> 00:46:42.510
But I also think we get
stuck with the percentages.

00:46:42.510 --> 00:46:49.914
Because if I'm born with genes
for pessimism-- actually,

00:46:49.914 --> 00:46:51.830
I was born probably with
genes for depression.

00:46:51.830 --> 00:46:54.170
I actually went through two
years of depression myself

00:46:54.170 --> 00:46:57.240
when I was at Harvard while
I was at the Divinity School.

00:46:57.240 --> 00:47:01.280
And as I was coming out of that,
what was helping me pull out

00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:03.679
of it was positive psychology
and some of these habits

00:47:03.679 --> 00:47:04.470
that we were doing.

00:47:04.470 --> 00:47:07.210
I was doing this journaling
exercise where you actually

00:47:07.210 --> 00:47:08.690
journal about
positive experience

00:47:08.690 --> 00:47:10.350
and meaningful
experience over the day.

00:47:10.350 --> 00:47:11.740
And because our
brains can't tell

00:47:11.740 --> 00:47:13.239
the difference
between visualization

00:47:13.239 --> 00:47:16.060
and actual experience,
it doubles the experience

00:47:16.060 --> 00:47:19.500
for the brain, and you
start to see more meaning.

00:47:19.500 --> 00:47:22.434
Even though I have
genes for that,

00:47:22.434 --> 00:47:24.850
I don't actually experience
depression very much any more.

00:47:24.850 --> 00:47:26.920
And when I start to go down
into a trough a little bit,

00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:29.640
I know it's short-lived, and I
can actually pop back out of it

00:47:29.640 --> 00:47:31.020
faster and faster now.

00:47:31.020 --> 00:47:33.130
And if that's the
case, then how much are

00:47:33.130 --> 00:47:35.350
the genes mattering
at this point?

00:47:35.350 --> 00:47:37.610
Are the genes starting
to go from 40% down

00:47:37.610 --> 00:47:40.490
to 30% down to 0%?

00:47:40.490 --> 00:47:42.640
If I have genes for
pessimism but I'm

00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:46.810
acting like an optimist,
maybe they have 0% of effect

00:47:46.810 --> 00:47:47.520
upon people.

00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:50.260
So part of what I think
is just the recognition

00:47:50.260 --> 00:47:52.410
that the external
world does not have

00:47:52.410 --> 00:47:55.320
a tyranny over people's
levels of happiness, which

00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:57.140
is why if you've
traveled a lot you've

00:47:57.140 --> 00:48:01.350
seen-- I've worked with very
wealthy bankers who have just

00:48:01.350 --> 00:48:04.670
been so depressed and devastated
in the middle of a banking

00:48:04.670 --> 00:48:05.400
crisis.

00:48:05.400 --> 00:48:07.350
And I've worked with
farmers in Zimbabwe who

00:48:07.350 --> 00:48:10.290
lost their land who are living
under a military dictator,

00:48:10.290 --> 00:48:12.330
and they're some of the
most optimistic people

00:48:12.330 --> 00:48:13.350
I've ever met.

00:48:13.350 --> 00:48:16.050
So I think it goes
with the common sense

00:48:16.050 --> 00:48:18.580
that we can find people
within every environment that

00:48:18.580 --> 00:48:19.880
are positive and negative.

00:48:19.880 --> 00:48:22.640
I think the key, though,
is how do we view reality.

00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:25.120
Because I was actually
out in northern California

00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:28.170
out here speaking to a
group of software companies,

00:48:28.170 --> 00:48:30.440
all CEOs of these top
software companies.

00:48:30.440 --> 00:48:32.510
You probably know
all these people.

00:48:32.510 --> 00:48:35.060
And one of the CEOs offered
to drive me to the airport

00:48:35.060 --> 00:48:38.442
after my talk, because
he wanted to figure out

00:48:38.442 --> 00:48:40.025
how we could cascade
this research out

00:48:40.025 --> 00:48:41.066
through his organization.

00:48:41.066 --> 00:48:42.690
And so I got into
his really nice car

00:48:42.690 --> 00:48:45.150
and put on my seat belt, and
he got in on the other side

00:48:45.150 --> 00:48:46.510
and immediately started
talking to me about what

00:48:46.510 --> 00:48:48.843
his company was experiencing,
all the change and stress.

00:48:48.843 --> 00:48:50.850
And that bell was
going off in his car

00:48:50.850 --> 00:48:52.433
because he hadn't
put on his seat belt

00:48:52.433 --> 00:48:54.795
yet and just kept going off
and eventually got tired

00:48:54.795 --> 00:48:55.910
and just stopped.

00:48:55.910 --> 00:48:58.436
And I turned to
him and I was like,

00:48:58.436 --> 00:48:59.560
you don't wear a seat belt?

00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:02.100
And he said, no, I
listened to your talk.

00:49:02.100 --> 00:49:03.210
I love your research.

00:49:03.210 --> 00:49:04.280
I'm an optimist.

00:49:04.280 --> 00:49:05.490
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]

00:49:05.490 --> 00:49:08.095
SHAWN ACHOR: I was like,
oh, you're an idiot.

00:49:08.095 --> 00:49:10.439
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]

00:49:10.439 --> 00:49:12.230
SHAWN ACHOR: But I'd
love to work with you.

00:49:12.230 --> 00:49:14.680
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]

00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:17.550
SHAWN ACHOR: Optimism is
great for a lot of things,

00:49:17.550 --> 00:49:19.970
but it doesn't stop
cars from hitting us.

00:49:19.970 --> 00:49:22.390
It doesn't stop reality
from impinging upon us.

00:49:22.390 --> 00:49:24.210
And that's irrational optimism.

00:49:24.210 --> 00:49:25.810
And there's books
and ideas out there

00:49:25.810 --> 00:49:27.510
that if you're like, if
I just change my mindset,

00:49:27.510 --> 00:49:28.870
everything will change for me.

00:49:28.870 --> 00:49:30.700
And that's actually irrational.

00:49:30.700 --> 00:49:33.660
Because if you
sugarcoat the present,

00:49:33.660 --> 00:49:35.700
we make bad decisions
in the future.

00:49:35.700 --> 00:49:38.500
And if we think that
reality won't impact us,

00:49:38.500 --> 00:49:40.560
we don't make any
changes to that reality,

00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:44.290
and it causes us to be blind
to injustices that are going on

00:49:44.290 --> 00:49:47.550
in the world or to racism
or to weaknesses in our life

00:49:47.550 --> 00:49:49.240
that we want to improve.

00:49:49.240 --> 00:49:51.130
Irrational optimists
don't put on a seat belt

00:49:51.130 --> 00:49:52.370
because they don't think
anything bad can happen

00:49:52.370 --> 00:49:54.940
to them, and a pessimist
doesn't put on a seat belt

00:49:54.940 --> 00:49:57.320
because they think they're
going to die anyway.

00:49:57.320 --> 00:50:00.070
But a rational optimist, which
is what I'm hoping people

00:50:00.070 --> 00:50:03.070
go for with this idea,
rational optimism

00:50:03.070 --> 00:50:05.670
doesn't start with
rose-colored glasses.

00:50:05.670 --> 00:50:08.600
It starts with a realistic
assessment of the present, both

00:50:08.600 --> 00:50:11.170
the good and the bad,
but maintains the belief

00:50:11.170 --> 00:50:12.419
that our behavior matters.

00:50:12.419 --> 00:50:14.210
It's linked to our
social support networks.

00:50:14.210 --> 00:50:15.200
I love that.

00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:17.420
The rational optimism takes
a realistic assessment

00:50:17.420 --> 00:50:18.850
of the present
first but maintains

00:50:18.850 --> 00:50:20.240
the belief my behavior matters.

00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:21.790
It's linked to the
people around me.

00:50:21.790 --> 00:50:26.030
And that, I think, is where
we want to go with this.

00:50:26.030 --> 00:50:28.350
I get people after
my talks who say,

00:50:28.350 --> 00:50:30.550
I'm not an optimist
or a pessimist.

00:50:30.550 --> 00:50:33.010
I'm just a realist
right now, which

00:50:33.010 --> 00:50:34.752
usually means
they're a pessimist.

00:50:34.752 --> 00:50:37.980
But what they're saying
is actually nonsensical,

00:50:37.980 --> 00:50:39.990
because both optimists
and pessimists

00:50:39.990 --> 00:50:41.550
can both be realists.

00:50:41.550 --> 00:50:44.360
Realism's seeing the problems
in this world and in our work

00:50:44.360 --> 00:50:45.370
and in our lives.

00:50:45.370 --> 00:50:48.430
Optimism and pessimism is what
happens after the problem.

00:50:48.430 --> 00:50:49.790
So you have to see reality.

00:50:49.790 --> 00:50:51.690
You know that reality
has an impact.

00:50:51.690 --> 00:50:53.700
But do I believe
that that problem is

00:50:53.700 --> 00:50:55.980
permanent and pervasive,
it affects everything,

00:50:55.980 --> 00:50:58.620
or it's local, it's one
part of your reality,

00:50:58.620 --> 00:50:59.700
and that it's temporary?

00:50:59.700 --> 00:51:00.670
This too will pass.

00:51:00.670 --> 00:51:02.810
That's where we want
people to get to,

00:51:02.810 --> 00:51:04.670
not to ignore the
reality but to realize

00:51:04.670 --> 00:51:05.670
that they can change it.

00:51:05.670 --> 00:51:07.360
So I love that quote
that you were talking

00:51:07.360 --> 00:51:09.693
about that you grew up with,
because it really is about,

00:51:09.693 --> 00:51:12.880
how do you take the world that
you have and move forward?

00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:13.520
So thank you.

00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:14.354
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:51:14.354 --> 00:51:16.978
AUDIENCE: I've heard the saying
you are the average of the five

00:51:16.978 --> 00:51:18.562
people you associate
with the most.

00:51:18.562 --> 00:51:19.270
SHAWN ACHOR: Wow.

00:51:19.270 --> 00:51:21.811
AUDIENCE: And whether
it's five or six,

00:51:21.811 --> 00:51:23.560
I don't think the
quantity really matters.

00:51:23.560 --> 00:51:25.370
And the intent of
the question is

00:51:25.370 --> 00:51:27.620
you grow with the
people around you.

00:51:27.620 --> 00:51:32.240
And so I started to really
question my relationships

00:51:32.240 --> 00:51:36.340
from high school to college and
now Google and moving forward.

00:51:36.340 --> 00:51:39.077
Were these relationships
based-- they've changed so much,

00:51:39.077 --> 00:51:40.660
and people that I
used to care about I

00:51:40.660 --> 00:51:42.300
haven't talked to in so long.

00:51:42.300 --> 00:51:44.090
And I'm progressing
forward in my career,

00:51:44.090 --> 00:51:47.567
and I'm really only
associating with people--

00:51:47.567 --> 00:51:49.650
I try to have genuine
conversations with everyone.

00:51:49.650 --> 00:51:51.160
But then I realized
two years later

00:51:51.160 --> 00:51:53.618
that, oh, I don't even talk to
this person I cared about so

00:51:53.618 --> 00:51:56.290
much, just because he's not
a part of my career anymore.

00:51:56.290 --> 00:51:57.620
Because it's such a
huge part in my life.

00:51:57.620 --> 00:51:58.250
SHAWN ACHOR: Yeah.

00:51:58.250 --> 00:51:59.666
AUDIENCE: And so
it's really tough

00:51:59.666 --> 00:52:03.750
to see are all my
relationships that superficial

00:52:03.750 --> 00:52:06.070
to the point of
helping me just kind of

00:52:06.070 --> 00:52:08.964
be a more powerful
force in the world?

00:52:08.964 --> 00:52:11.130
Because I think we all care
about changing the world

00:52:11.130 --> 00:52:13.120
and having an impact,
and that's really hard

00:52:13.120 --> 00:52:14.940
when you try to really
build relationships.

00:52:14.940 --> 00:52:16.550
And when you say cut
people out of your life

00:52:16.550 --> 00:52:17.890
that are bringing
you down, it may

00:52:17.890 --> 00:52:20.181
be that they're in a stage
in which they need the most,

00:52:20.181 --> 00:52:23.260
and you've just cut them out.

00:52:23.260 --> 00:52:26.220
Sometimes I reflect on this,
and I go into a very dark place

00:52:26.220 --> 00:52:26.820
very quickly.

00:52:26.820 --> 00:52:28.640
SHAWN ACHOR: Yeah.

00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:31.050
AUDIENCE: I'm pretty happy
guy, more or less than not.

00:52:31.050 --> 00:52:34.309
But I think about
this stuff a lot,

00:52:34.309 --> 00:52:36.100
and I was wondering
what your opinions are.

00:52:36.100 --> 00:52:37.230
SHAWN ACHOR: Yeah.

00:52:37.230 --> 00:52:39.646
Thank you for sharing that,
because I think about this lot

00:52:39.646 --> 00:52:41.620
too because I find
the same thing.

00:52:41.620 --> 00:52:43.450
It's less about my career.

00:52:43.450 --> 00:52:46.110
It's more about who's in
my immediate vicinity.

00:52:46.110 --> 00:52:48.830
I even saw it with my freshmen
then when I was a Proctor.

00:52:48.830 --> 00:52:51.177
I'd be so close and
tight with my freshmen.

00:52:51.177 --> 00:52:52.760
And then as soon as
they got moved off

00:52:52.760 --> 00:52:55.700
to the River Houses or
the Quad, I was like, OK,

00:52:55.700 --> 00:52:58.172
I've got my new friends,
the new freshmen

00:52:58.172 --> 00:52:59.130
that came in this year.

00:52:59.130 --> 00:53:01.310
And what I found was it was
so frustrating because I cared

00:53:01.310 --> 00:53:03.330
so much about my family
members, these friends

00:53:03.330 --> 00:53:06.400
that I had had in the past, but
they were outside of my sphere,

00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:08.470
because we're so
used to interacting

00:53:08.470 --> 00:53:10.850
with the people that are in
your sphere, which at work,

00:53:10.850 --> 00:53:14.090
if you're focused on work, that
entire sphere might be here.

00:53:14.090 --> 00:53:16.526
So of course the
people closest to you

00:53:16.526 --> 00:53:18.400
might be the people that
are directly related

00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:19.024
to that career.

00:53:22.270 --> 00:53:24.912
And I make a little bit of fun
of cutting the negative people

00:53:24.912 --> 00:53:26.370
out of our life,
because I actually

00:53:26.370 --> 00:53:27.802
don't want people to do that.

00:53:27.802 --> 00:53:30.010
I think it misses out on
how powerful we can actually

00:53:30.010 --> 00:53:32.930
be in these relationships,
even if they're short-term.

00:53:32.930 --> 00:53:35.480
Because at Yale they
found that if you

00:53:35.480 --> 00:53:37.840
have three strangers
come into the room,

00:53:37.840 --> 00:53:39.430
all with different emotions--

00:53:39.430 --> 00:53:41.620
I get asked a lot,
who's more powerful,

00:53:41.620 --> 00:53:44.230
the positive people in your
life and the negative people?

00:53:44.230 --> 00:53:45.270
You might have a positive
team, but there's

00:53:45.270 --> 00:53:47.090
this one negative guy
on the team that's

00:53:47.090 --> 00:53:49.851
dragging the whole team down, or
one positive person that you're

00:53:49.851 --> 00:53:52.350
talking about that's very calm
that gets everyone else to be

00:53:52.350 --> 00:53:53.230
calm.

00:53:53.230 --> 00:53:54.800
We can't answer that question,
because it's different

00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:55.740
every time we test it.

00:53:55.740 --> 00:53:57.030
Sometimes it's the
positive person.

00:53:57.030 --> 00:53:58.488
Sometimes it's the
negative person.

00:53:58.488 --> 00:54:01.550
What we found is it was
a different variable.

00:54:01.550 --> 00:54:03.550
They found that the other
two people in the room

00:54:03.550 --> 00:54:05.640
leave with an increased
likelihood of experiencing

00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:07.800
the emotions of
the most verbally

00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:10.400
and non-verbally expressive
person in the room.

00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:12.420
So what that means is
verbally or non-verbally,

00:54:12.420 --> 00:54:15.690
if I'm very expressive of my
pessimism or my negativity,

00:54:15.690 --> 00:54:18.110
I'm changing that social script.

00:54:18.110 --> 00:54:20.640
And what we found is social
influence in our lives

00:54:20.640 --> 00:54:22.320
is defined by three
things, the strength

00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:25.490
of our message, the immediacy,
how important that message is

00:54:25.490 --> 00:54:27.145
to people, and the
number of sources

00:54:27.145 --> 00:54:29.680
that are giving
that same message.

00:54:29.680 --> 00:54:33.030
What we found is that if you're
wanting to try and create

00:54:33.030 --> 00:54:34.800
a positive effect
upon other people,

00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:37.550
you want to increase the
strength of that message, to be

00:54:37.550 --> 00:54:39.460
more positive verbally
and non-verbally

00:54:39.460 --> 00:54:43.390
in those relationships to try
and change those five or six

00:54:43.390 --> 00:54:45.867
people that might be
in our average circle.

00:54:45.867 --> 00:54:47.700
But also, you're trying
to increase the end.

00:54:47.700 --> 00:54:50.094
Oftentimes when we think
about those negative people,

00:54:50.094 --> 00:54:51.760
we should actually
not be going straight

00:54:51.760 --> 00:54:52.690
for the negative person.

00:54:52.690 --> 00:54:53.925
We should be increasing
the positivity

00:54:53.925 --> 00:54:56.610
of the people in the middle that
we could tip towards positive

00:54:56.610 --> 00:54:58.380
that help make that
person actually

00:54:58.380 --> 00:55:00.092
see a social script
that's more positive.

00:55:00.092 --> 00:55:02.550
But what's interesting, the
other part about your question,

00:55:02.550 --> 00:55:05.610
is these strong ties versus
weak ties, which I actually

00:55:05.610 --> 00:55:07.019
do a lot of research on.

00:55:07.019 --> 00:55:08.810
Weak ties are actually
much more predictive

00:55:08.810 --> 00:55:11.970
of your long-term success
than the strong ties are.

00:55:11.970 --> 00:55:14.910
Happiness levels,
though, are related

00:55:14.910 --> 00:55:17.970
to both, the breadth and
depth of your relationships.

00:55:17.970 --> 00:55:19.930
So part of what
we find is people,

00:55:19.930 --> 00:55:22.300
depending on your introversion
or your extroversion,

00:55:22.300 --> 00:55:25.250
you can have lots of friends or
small friends, deep or broad,

00:55:25.250 --> 00:55:28.720
and what we found is that
it really is how you see it,

00:55:28.720 --> 00:55:31.440
how you see those interactions.

00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:34.459
Do you see them as only
weak ties, in which case

00:55:34.459 --> 00:55:36.250
they don't actually
provide as much meaning

00:55:36.250 --> 00:55:38.150
to you, in which case
you don't actually

00:55:38.150 --> 00:55:40.300
feel sustained by that
social support network?

00:55:40.300 --> 00:55:42.383
It's what we see with
social media a lot of times.

00:55:42.383 --> 00:55:46.910
When people follow people on
Twitter or on any social media

00:55:46.910 --> 00:55:49.150
platform, if they
follow people they

00:55:49.150 --> 00:55:52.410
don't know they get no return
on their investment of time

00:55:52.410 --> 00:55:54.377
in terms of social connection.

00:55:54.377 --> 00:55:55.960
But if they follow
people that they're

00:55:55.960 --> 00:55:57.920
friends from high school
and they see that they just

00:55:57.920 --> 00:56:00.030
had a kid or they just got
a job and they actually

00:56:00.030 --> 00:56:02.940
do see them at some point or
they do interact with them,

00:56:02.940 --> 00:56:04.990
they have a depth of
their social knowledge

00:56:04.990 --> 00:56:07.540
that deepens that relationship
and causes more meaning.

00:56:07.540 --> 00:56:09.869
So what I've been doing in
my life-- this sounds very

00:56:09.869 --> 00:56:11.410
similar to what
you're experiencing--

00:56:11.410 --> 00:56:14.240
is I try to reconnect with
some of those people in very

00:56:14.240 --> 00:56:17.070
short bursts but
in meaningful ways.

00:56:17.070 --> 00:56:19.170
And one of the habits
that I have people

00:56:19.170 --> 00:56:21.210
do at these companies
is every day

00:56:21.210 --> 00:56:23.830
when you get into work write
a two-minute email praising

00:56:23.830 --> 00:56:26.190
or thanking or reconnecting
with one person.

00:56:26.190 --> 00:56:26.690
That's it.

00:56:26.690 --> 00:56:28.760
Two minutes maximum,
so it's super short.

00:56:28.760 --> 00:56:31.160
It's two or three sentences.

00:56:31.160 --> 00:56:31.709
Try it today.

00:56:31.709 --> 00:56:33.250
Just connect with
one of those people

00:56:33.250 --> 00:56:36.075
you feel like is outside
of that career sphere.

00:56:36.075 --> 00:56:37.700
And if you do it for
three days, you'll

00:56:37.700 --> 00:56:39.280
literally become addicted
to it, because you're

00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:41.696
going to spend all day long
thinking about how amazing you

00:56:41.696 --> 00:56:43.446
were for writing that email.

00:56:43.446 --> 00:56:45.300
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]

00:56:45.300 --> 00:56:47.780
SHAWN ACHOR: But what happens
is 21 days later as you've

00:56:47.780 --> 00:56:50.030
reconnected to those people,
your brain realizes, wow,

00:56:50.030 --> 00:56:52.530
I have incredibly
robust social support.

00:56:52.530 --> 00:56:56.410
I saw some of you this morning
that I hadn't seen from my time

00:56:56.410 --> 00:56:57.860
at Harvard, and
it's so exciting.

00:56:57.860 --> 00:57:00.670
I haven't seen you in so
long, and it's so exciting

00:57:00.670 --> 00:57:02.850
to have those opportunities.

00:57:02.850 --> 00:57:05.210
What we found is social
support is the greatest

00:57:05.210 --> 00:57:07.410
predictor of long-term
happiness we have.

00:57:07.410 --> 00:57:11.080
So instead of
fleeing from negative

00:57:11.080 --> 00:57:14.800
or only investing in our sphere,
if we can find just small ways

00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:18.022
to increase and deepen
that social connection,

00:57:18.022 --> 00:57:20.230
we've found it's the greatest
predictor of happiness.

00:57:20.230 --> 00:57:21.605
At Columbia, they
found that if I

00:57:21.605 --> 00:57:24.532
know the collective IQ on a team
and the years of experience,

00:57:24.532 --> 00:57:26.240
neither of those are
as predictive as how

00:57:26.240 --> 00:57:28.690
tight the team feels, so
we know it's important.

00:57:28.690 --> 00:57:31.330
But then the last part, my
favorite statistic right now,

00:57:31.330 --> 00:57:34.720
which is actually by a guy
named Dr. House, which I think

00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:39.160
is hilarious, he found
that the social connection

00:57:39.160 --> 00:57:43.040
is as predictive of how long
you will live as obesity,

00:57:43.040 --> 00:57:45.760
high blood pressure, or smoking.

00:57:45.760 --> 00:57:47.570
We fight so hard
against the negative,

00:57:47.570 --> 00:57:50.270
and we forget about how
powerful two minutes

00:57:50.270 --> 00:57:52.180
of a positive
interaction could be.

00:57:52.180 --> 00:57:54.310
So yeah, I feel the
exact same thing,

00:57:54.310 --> 00:57:56.840
and I think it's how we
perceive those relationships

00:57:56.840 --> 00:57:58.781
that, while they
might be temporary,

00:57:58.781 --> 00:58:01.030
that doesn't take away the
meaning involved with them,

00:58:01.030 --> 00:58:03.520
just as everything that
is temporary in life

00:58:03.520 --> 00:58:05.572
is not destroyed of meaning.

00:58:05.572 --> 00:58:06.780
This is from Buddhism, right?

00:58:09.524 --> 00:58:11.190
While things are
temporary, that doesn't

00:58:11.190 --> 00:58:12.250
mean that there's
not meaningful.

00:58:12.250 --> 00:58:14.208
In fact, that can actually
increase the meaning

00:58:14.208 --> 00:58:17.194
of those short times that
we have with those people.

00:58:17.194 --> 00:58:18.610
CHADE-MENG TAN:
We're out of time,

00:58:18.610 --> 00:58:21.410
so I just have one short
last question for you, Shawn.

00:58:21.410 --> 00:58:24.560
What can we, Google, do for you?

00:58:24.560 --> 00:58:25.450
SHAWN ACHOR: Oh.

00:58:25.450 --> 00:58:26.880
You already did it for coming.

00:58:26.880 --> 00:58:28.260
Thank you so much for coming.

00:58:28.260 --> 00:58:30.410
I think the biggest
thing is help us

00:58:30.410 --> 00:58:32.280
get this positive
research out there more.

00:58:32.280 --> 00:58:36.360
Tal Ben-Shahar told me that he
had an adviser who said that

00:58:36.360 --> 00:58:39.830
the average scientific journal
article is only read by seven

00:58:39.830 --> 00:58:40.670

[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]

00:58:41.630 --> 00:58:42.440
SHAWN ACHOR: --which
is incredibly

00:58:42.440 --> 00:58:44.773
depressing for a researcher
to hear, because I know that

00:58:44.773 --> 00:58:46.320
also includes my mom.

00:58:46.320 --> 00:58:47.804
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]

00:58:47.804 --> 00:58:49.220
SHAWN ACHOR: So
if there's any way

00:58:49.220 --> 00:58:50.270
you can share this research.

00:58:50.270 --> 00:58:52.150
I think the best way is
to tell people about it.

00:58:52.150 --> 00:58:53.920
Tell people they're
not just their genes

00:58:53.920 --> 00:58:54.795
or their environment.

00:58:54.795 --> 00:58:56.710
But really the best
way is to show them.

00:58:56.710 --> 00:58:58.360
Pick up a positive habit.

00:58:58.360 --> 00:59:00.660
Get involved with
one of these programs

00:59:00.660 --> 00:59:02.649
to create one of these
positive changes.

00:59:02.649 --> 00:59:04.440
Because what we find
is that it ripples out

00:59:04.440 --> 00:59:07.160
so much to effect other people.

00:59:07.160 --> 00:59:07.980
Real quick story.

00:59:07.980 --> 00:59:11.769
I was working with a CEO
of a fast food company.

00:59:11.769 --> 00:59:14.060
He sold his company for
hundreds of millions of dollars

00:59:14.060 --> 00:59:15.140
and had a breakdown.

00:59:15.140 --> 00:59:16.590
He made millions of dollars.

00:59:16.590 --> 00:59:19.870
But that night he went
on track with his wife

00:59:19.870 --> 00:59:22.787
and start walking off some of
the weight that he had gained

00:59:22.787 --> 00:59:25.120
and talking about things that
he was grateful for, doing

00:59:25.120 --> 00:59:25.953
that positive habit.

00:59:25.953 --> 00:59:28.292
It was so helpful that they
start doing it and telling

00:59:28.292 --> 00:59:29.750
their kids that
they were doing it.

00:59:29.750 --> 00:59:32.207
And they got a call from one
of their friend's parents

00:59:32.207 --> 00:59:34.540
who said, did you hear what
happened at the summer party

00:59:34.540 --> 00:59:35.510
for your daughter?

00:59:35.510 --> 00:59:36.635
And they were like, oh, no.

00:59:36.635 --> 00:59:38.110
Was there drinking or boys?

00:59:38.110 --> 00:59:42.426
And they said, no, she got
everyone in her friend group

00:59:42.426 --> 00:59:44.050
to sit around and
talk about the things

00:59:44.050 --> 00:59:46.425
that they were grateful for
that were going on at school.

00:59:46.425 --> 00:59:48.910
We can actually create a
different social script

00:59:48.910 --> 00:59:51.234
for the world where people
don't wait for happiness off

00:59:51.234 --> 00:59:53.150
in the future but actually
are creating it now

00:59:53.150 --> 00:59:55.320
and actually are
tipping this world away

00:59:55.320 --> 00:59:57.380
from negativity and
stress to a world that

00:59:57.380 --> 01:00:00.040
believes this behavior matters
and can see ways of changing

01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:02.910
this reality into a better
reality for all of us,

01:00:02.910 --> 01:00:04.070
which is why I get excited.
