00:00:07.052 --> 00:00:08.760
MALE SPEAKER: Good
afternoon, and welcome

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.150
to Talks at Google in
Cambridge, Massachusetts.

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.630
Today it is my
very great pleasure

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:18.680
to introduce one of my
favorite writers, Brock Clarke.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.020
Brock is the author of
six books, most recently,

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.060
"The Happiest People
in the World,"

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.420
and "An Arsonist's
Guide to Writers' Homes

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.605
in New England," which
was a national bestseller

00:00:29.605 --> 00:00:33.060
and has appeared in a
dozen foreign editions.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.710
His stories and essays
have appeared in a number

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.530
of prestigious publications.

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.680
He received a national Endowment
for the Arts fellowship in 2008

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.410
and has twice been a finalist
for the National Magazine Award

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.700
for Fiction.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.880
He teaches creative
writing at Bowdoin College.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.580
In addition, he is one
of my favorite writers.

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:55.220
I admit it.

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.120
I'm an unabashed fan boy.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.990
I promised I wouldn't
gush, so that's it.

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.555
I find his fiction
simultaneously heartbreaking

00:01:03.555 --> 00:01:06.200
and uplifting, and I
don't feel the same

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.420
about the world or
myself after finishing

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.910
one of his darkly funny novels.

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:15.400
Please join me in
welcoming Brock Clarke.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.650
BROCK CLARKE: Thank you, John.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:20.840
Hello.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.360
Thank you for having me.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.510
Thank you for coming.

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:26.272
I'm going to read
from this new book.

00:01:26.272 --> 00:01:28.230
It's called "The Happiest
People in the World."

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:29.382
Can you all hear me OK?

00:01:29.382 --> 00:01:31.340
I was told I have this
helpful note to project.

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.380
But I also have a
terrible history

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.890
with microphones, feedback,
people weeping in front rows,

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:37.390
fleeing.

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.190
So I'll try hard not to
replicate that experience.

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.147
Anyways, this book is
called "The Happiest People

00:01:43.147 --> 00:01:43.730
in the World."

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:47.160
And the origin is I
went to Denmark in 2005

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.130
with my-- my wife
had worked there.

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.320
My wife, son, and I went.

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.580
And before I went, I had
never even thought of Denmark

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.270
as a place, let alone
a place I would go.

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.686
I mean, when I
thought of Denmark,

00:01:55.686 --> 00:01:57.200
I thought of tulips
and windmills,

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.810
which meant when I thought of
Denmark, I thought of Holland.

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.120
It's an entirely
different country.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.460
That's how little
I thought about it.

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.442
And when I went
there, I absolutely

00:02:03.442 --> 00:02:05.120
fell in love with
the place the way

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.300
I do, at least, with the
most unlikely places,

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.149
the least likely places.

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.190
I was really happy there.

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:11.912
I thought of this
place as the place

00:02:11.912 --> 00:02:13.620
that I could live and
be a different kind

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.911
of Brock Clarke, which I
always desperately want to be.

00:02:15.911 --> 00:02:18.970
And anyways, I was forced
finally to go home.

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:19.560
I had work.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.400
My wife had work.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.030
And I thought about
Denmark a lot.

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.344
I kept thinking about it as this
sort of place that mysteriously

00:02:25.344 --> 00:02:26.260
meant something to me.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.790
And then not long after
that, these cartoonists

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.532
for "Jyllands-Posten," which
is a newspaper in Copenhagen,

00:02:32.532 --> 00:02:34.990
were asked to draw cartoons of
the prophet Muhammad as they

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.750
saw him.

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:36.960
And they did that.

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.642
And one of them, in particular,
drew this cartoon of Muhammad

00:02:39.642 --> 00:02:40.850
with a bomb under his turban.

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.307
And some of the expected
things happened.

00:02:43.307 --> 00:02:44.640
And I began to think about this.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.090
The Danes are always called the
happiest people in the world.

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.100
They're found by these studies
to be the happiest people

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.850
in the world.

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.620
And I'd wondered about that
weird intersection of people

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.010
who are supposedly happy
making other people

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.925
in their same country
profoundly unhappy.

00:02:57.925 --> 00:02:59.300
And as usual,
because writers are

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.260
among the most mercenary
people in the world,

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.567
I tried to figure out how I
can make this into a novel.

00:03:04.567 --> 00:03:05.900
I could get something out of it.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.358
So what I decided to do-- and
I could talk about this later

00:03:08.358 --> 00:03:10.670
if any of you have
any questions-- was

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.790
to create a cartoonist, a
fictional cartoonist who then--

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.080
well, you'll see-- a
fictional cartoonist

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.479
in this faraway place,
in Skagen, Denmark.

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:21.020
What I'm going to
do in reading this,

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:22.640
I'm going to read
an opening chapter.

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.559
And then I'm going to
skip around a little bit

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:27.100
to chase the novel with a number
of different points of view.

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.860
And then I'll wrap up.

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.470
And I'd be happy to answer
questions either along the way

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:32.947
or at the end.

00:03:32.947 --> 00:03:33.780
So again, thank you.

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.330
Some swearing in here, as usual.

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:36.082
I apologize.

00:03:36.082 --> 00:03:37.790
I've been doing my
best to keep it clean.

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.170
I did this weird present--
I gave a reading at Clemson

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.700
University this past weekend.

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.782
I made the mistake
of agreeing to talk

00:03:43.782 --> 00:03:45.240
to a bunch of high
school students.

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.780
And the thing I was talking
about, I couldn't clean it up.

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:48.860
It would make no sense.

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.960
And I pretty much got run out
of the state of South Carolina.

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.219
So I'm going to try really
hard to keep it cleaner,

00:03:54.219 --> 00:03:56.010
although I'm sure it
doesn't matter to you.

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.740
OK.

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:01.590
"What is only slightly less
well-known is that soon after

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.670
the first Danish
Embassy was torched,

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.470
soon after the
first death threat,

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:08.360
soon after the first attempted
murder of the cartoonist,

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.490
the editor of a newspaper, the
'Optimist,' in Skagen, Denmark,

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:15.560
asked his staff cartoonist,
he had only one--

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.269
it was a weekly newspaper
with a small circulation--

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:21.110
to draw a cartoon depicting
in some way or other

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:25.450
the controversy over the by now
infamous cartoons of Muhammad.

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.380
'Me?' the cartoonist asked.

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.080
His name was Jens Baedrup.

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.500
He'd worked at the
paper for nine years.

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.460
Mostly he drew cartoons of
local interest, tourists eating

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.080
hot dogs, while walking too
slowly in the pedestrian mall,

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.820
grizzled fishermen
acting surprised

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.370
at seeing fish they just caught
on display at the market,

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.500
as though to say, what
are you doing here?

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.690
Scanians caught in bad weather
and making the best of it.

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.050
In fact, his most recent cartoon
had been of a man and a woman

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:53.780
standing under a
roof and the man

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.460
saying, 'At least, we have
a roof over our heads'

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.060
and the woman not
saying anything,

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:01.680
just looking miserable because
she was drenched and so was he,

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.610
because the rain was
blowing sideways,

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:07.010
and the roof structure they were
standing under had no walls.

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:10.770
'Yes, you.' 'Why?'
the cartoonist asked.

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:13.370
Of course, he'd been following
the whole thing on television,

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:15.310
on the radio, in the newspaper.

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:17.810
It made him anxious,
angry, annoyed,

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:20.470
the way things do when you
don't know whom to blame.

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:22.690
But then again, these
cartoons had been published

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:24.180
in a Copenhagen newspaper.

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.140
And Skagen was as far
away from Copenhagen

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:27.890
as you could get and
still be in Denmark."

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:30.170
Anyone here ever been to
Skagen, he asked lamely.

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.670
No.

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:32.360
So Denmark's like
a tip of a finger.

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.375
And the very tip
ending east is Skagen.

00:05:35.375 --> 00:05:36.750
And so I looked
on the map, and I

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.450
thought, where is
the furthest place

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:39.960
you could get in this
country where you could not

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:40.640
escape from?

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.190
And then I chose that place.

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:45.190
That's Skagen.

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:47.550
"In fact it was common
for people in Skagen,

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:49.630
after learning of some
outrageous news coming out

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:52.090
of the nation's capital
five hours to the south,

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:55.305
to shrug it off by saying,
but that's Copenhagen.

00:05:55.305 --> 00:05:57.810
'Because this is
important,' the editor said.

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:59.310
'I think you'll do a good job.

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:03.360
I can't think of anyone I rather
have do this job than you.'

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:04.900
The cartoonist
recognized that this

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:08.040
was tainted praise or at least
praise with an ulterior motive.

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:10.440
But that did not mean
he was immune to it.

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:11.720
He thought for a minute.

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.672
He would've asked
his wife her opinion.

00:06:13.672 --> 00:06:15.630
But she had gone to visit
her parents in Aarhus

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:18.400
and wasn't due back in
Skagen for another week.

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.690
He could have called her
on the phone, of course,

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:23.110
but things had not been
going too well with them.

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:25.020
Lately, every
little disagreement

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:27.150
threatened to turn into
a large argument, which

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:28.910
then threatened to
turn into a referendum

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:30.417
on the marriage itself.

00:06:30.417 --> 00:06:32.500
And one of the things they
most often argued about

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.840
was the cartoonist's
unshakable optimism,

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:37.690
his belief that everything
was going to be just fine.

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:39.740
He knew if he
called and asked her

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:41.510
whether he should
draw the cartoon,

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:43.052
she would question
his mental health.

00:06:43.052 --> 00:06:45.468
'I don't know what you're so
worried about,' he would then

00:06:45.468 --> 00:06:46.120
say.

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:48.300
I think everything's
going to be just fine.

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:50.120
And then she would
mockingly call him

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:53.520
the 'Skagen Optimist,' which
in addition to being the name

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:57.080
of the newspaper, was also the
name of the weekly cartoon.

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:59.550
In fact, the cartoon of the
man and his wife getting

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:01.400
wet from the sideways
rain had been

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:04.279
based on something that had
happened to them-- twice.

00:07:04.279 --> 00:07:06.820
The cartoonist thought that by
having the wife in the cartoon

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:08.790
remain silent--
in real life, she

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:11.390
had not remained silent--
his wife would not recognize

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:13.000
herself in the cartoon.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
But this turned out to
be yet another example

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.880
of his over-optimism.

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:19.200
So instead of calling
his wife, the cartoonist

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:20.892
let his mind argue
with itself the way

00:07:20.892 --> 00:07:22.850
it does when it's about
to let you do something

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:24.350
you'll later regret.

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:27.030
'You really shouldn't
do this,' his mind said.

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:28.160
'But I'll do a good job.

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.570
The editor said so
himself.' 'The editor is

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:33.496
a liar.' 'Yes, but no one
is a liar all the time.'

00:07:33.496 --> 00:07:35.620
'But you don't even have
a strong opinion about all

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:38.360
this.' 'Who better to draw a
cartoon like this than someone

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:41.130
who doesn't have a strong
opinion?' 'Tell that to people

00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:42.719
who have strong opinions.'

00:07:42.719 --> 00:07:44.010
'This is the "Skagen Optimist."

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:47.740
No one is ever going to see the
cartoon anyway.' 'Then why do

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:51.090
it?' 'Because it's my job.'
And with that sentence,

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:53.820
a good many arguments that
should go on for much longer

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:55.610
are brought to a close.

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:57.520
'Fine,' the cartoonist
said to his editor.

00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:59.850
I'll do it.' 'Good,'
the editor said.

00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:02.470
'I'll need it before
you go home tonight.'

00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:04.470
After receiving his
assignment, the cartoonist

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:07.160
took a long walk through
Skagen, his heart narrating

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:08.090
his journey.

00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:10.260
Skagen, the town
between two seas,

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:13.120
the town with the pretty yellow
houses with the red tile roofs

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:15.350
and the neat yards, the
town with the wet wind

00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:18.640
and the cold sand, the town that
painters in the 19th century

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:21.570
made famous for its light, the
town where the eastward moving

00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:24.490
waves from the North Sea crash
into the westward moving waves

00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:27.110
from the Baltic, and the
spectacle is so great that even

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:30.440
the skeptical end up taking
too many pictures, the town so

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:33.929
orderly and good that even the
hulking tankers from Sweden,

00:08:33.929 --> 00:08:36.260
and Norway, and
England, and Germany

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:40.159
patiently wait in lines that
stretch from one sea to another

00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:42.659
before easing into the
docks at Skagen Havn,

00:08:42.659 --> 00:08:45.344
the town where my parents
were born and where they died,

00:08:45.344 --> 00:08:47.510
the town where I was married
in the big white church

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:50.051
with the little white clipper
ships dangling from the ceiling

00:08:50.051 --> 00:08:51.850
in between the
chandeliers, the town

00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:56.709
I have lived in for 42
years, the town I love.

00:08:56.709 --> 00:08:58.750
It is said that the Danes
are the happiest people

00:08:58.750 --> 00:09:01.275
in the world, and if that's
true then the people from Skagen

00:09:01.275 --> 00:09:03.390
are happier even than that.

00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:05.379
That was what the
cartoonist was feeling.

00:09:05.379 --> 00:09:07.420
And he was also feeling
that some of the cartoons

00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:09.860
in 'Jyllands-Posten'
had made him unhappy,

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:12.130
and so had the violent
reactions to them,

00:09:12.130 --> 00:09:14.370
and now so had this assignment.

00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:16.280
That's when he got his idea.

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:18.380
He went back to the
newspaper's office,

00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:21.550
drew a cartoon featuring
a group of unhappy Danes.

00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:24.660
One knew they were Danes because
they were frowning inexpertly,

00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:27.100
as if unhappiness had
come to them only recently

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:28.850
and they didn't quite
know how to show it.

00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:31.650
And one also knew they were
Danes because they were white.

00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:34.210
And hovering over them
like an ominous cloud

00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:36.990
was the cartoonist's rendering
of the now infamous cartoon

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:39.340
of Muhammad with a
bomb in his turban.

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:42.110
Once he was finished, Jens
handed the camera to his editor

00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:45.840
saying, 'I think this is
pretty good.' The editor looked

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:46.910
at the cartoon.

00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:49.100
He had been the newspaper's
editor for three years,

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:52.360
and he hated the job, the
constant deadlines, the ink

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:55.060
everywhere, the reporters'
bad-tempered arguments

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:57.720
about what constituted good
grammar, the general sense

00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:00.430
of everything having been
much better yesterday.

00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:01.389
He could've just quit."

00:10:01.389 --> 00:10:03.055
I was a newspaper
journalist for a while

00:10:03.055 --> 00:10:04.550
so that's the one
thing I remember

00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:06.390
about being that thing.

00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:08.600
"He could've just quit, but
the newspaper's publisher

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:09.780
was his father.

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:12.690
The paper had been owned and
run by his family for almost two

00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:13.572
centuries.

00:10:13.572 --> 00:10:15.280
Quitting the paper
would be like quitting

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:17.730
his family, something
that seemed less possible

00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:19.064
the more he wanted it.

00:10:19.064 --> 00:10:21.230
The editor just hadn't been
able to figure a way out

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:23.810
of the whole mess until now.

00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:25.760
'I do think it's pretty
good,' the editor said

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:27.010
to the cartoonist.

00:10:27.010 --> 00:10:29.990
Then he published
it the next day.

00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:32.180
Less than a week later,
the 'Skagen Optimist'

00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:35.030
decided, after someone had
thrown Molotov cocktails

00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:36.900
through its windows,
to shut down

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:40.140
after nearly 200 years of
continuous publication.

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:43.070
Meanwhile, the cartoonist,
accompanied by agents

00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:45.470
from the Danish Security
and Intelligence Service

00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:47.970
had gone to his in-laws'
house in Aarhus.

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:49.770
His wife had met
him at the door.

00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:51.810
She knew by now
about the cartoon.

00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:55.240
It and the cartoonist had
made the television news.

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:57.320
She also knew about
the death threats.

00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:58.950
They'd made the news too.

00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:01.440
'Everything is going to be
just fine,' Jens had told her

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:04.280
repeatedly on the phone
over the previous week.

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:07.440
'Oh, Jens,' she replied, 'What
were you thinking?' 'I was

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:10.650
thinking everything was going
to be just fine,' he'd said.

00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:12.620
But she didn't know
yet about their house.

00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:15.030
Someone had set fire to
it six hours earlier.

00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:16.600
He told her about it.

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:18.510
'Gone?' she said.

00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:20.360
'I'm sorry, Ilsa,' he said.

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:21.990
'Gone,' she repeated.

00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:23.680
Her eyes were far away.

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:27.190
He could see her seeing their
house, their marriage-- gone,

00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:27.990
gone.

00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:30.147
Skagen would be
gone for her too.

00:11:30.147 --> 00:11:31.980
Jens would always want
to go back to Skagen,

00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:34.560
but the agents told him he
wouldn't be able to because

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:36.100
of their plan for him.

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:38.420
Ilsa would be able to go
back there if she wanted,

00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:39.840
but she wouldn't want to.

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:41.320
She was from Aarhus.

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:42.510
That was her home.

00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:44.950
For her, Skagen would
always be the small town

00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:47.200
with the burned down house
and the ruined marriage.

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:49.240
And that, to Jens, felt
like the worst thing

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:51.280
that had ever happened to him.

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:53.260
'Where will you
go?' she asked him.

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.730
He cocked his head
toward the car idling

00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:57.300
in the street behind him.

00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:59.590
'They're figuring that
out right now,' he said.

00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:01.079
And then he told her the plan.

00:12:01.079 --> 00:12:03.120
The plan was for the agents
to announce that Jens

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:04.760
had been killed in the fire.

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:06.680
The agents had recommended this.

00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:08.310
They told Jens that
whoever had set

00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:11.960
the fire wouldn't stop trying
to kill him until he was dead.

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:13.830
So they were, with
his permission,

00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:15.500
going to declare him dead.

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:17.610
'It's the best way,'
Jens told Ilsa,

00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:19.590
repeating what the
agents had told him.

00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:22.230
He looked to see whether
Ilsa understood all of this.

00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:25.120
She looked back at him
with big, solemn eyes.

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:27.500
'What do I have
to do?' she asked.

00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:29.600
'You have to act like
I'm dead,' he said.

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:30.620
She nodded.

00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:32.820
'I can do that,' she said.

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:34.760
After that, neither
Jens nor Ilsa

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:36.390
seemed to know what to say.

00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:38.376
Jens fought off the
urge to tell her again

00:12:38.376 --> 00:12:40.750
that everything would be just
fine, even though he really

00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:42.570
did believe that was true.

00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:44.400
He also fought off
the urge to tell her

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:47.220
that he was scared,
although that was true too.

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:49.810
Because what do you say when
a marriage ends like this?

00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:52.761
Jens pictured a cartoon in
which a man and a woman--

00:12:52.761 --> 00:12:55.260
the woman's standing in front
of a burning house and the man

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:59.140
in front of an open grave--
handed oversize wedding rings

00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:01.240
back to each other,
the woman saying,

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:03.070
'Well, that was a mistake.'

00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:05.850
And then Jens turned,
walked to the agent's car,

00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:08.320
got into the backseat,
and closed the door.

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:09.670
The car drove off.

00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:11.740
There were two agents
in the front seat.

00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:13.540
Jens was by himself in the back.

00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:15.960
After a moment, he said,
'That was horrible,

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:18.780
but I do think I got through
it fairly well.' But the agents

00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:19.960
didn't respond.

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:21.830
Possibly, they didn't
hear Jens because he

00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:24.456
was crying so hard as he
spoke, or because they

00:13:24.456 --> 00:13:25.830
were busy figuring
out where they

00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:29.331
were going to take him next,
where he was going to run."

00:13:29.331 --> 00:13:29.830
OK.

00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:31.913
So the next chapter, which
I'm going to skip over,

00:13:31.913 --> 00:13:33.820
is from the point
of view of Tarik,

00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:38.642
who's the young man who
burned down Jens's house.

00:13:38.642 --> 00:13:40.183
He's going to appear
in a chapter I'm

00:13:40.183 --> 00:13:41.450
going to read in a little bit.

00:13:41.450 --> 00:13:41.950
OK.

00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:47.690
"Two years later, as Jens
Baedrup was in one city--

00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:50.110
it was in Berlin, to
which he'd already run,

00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:52.630
preparing to run somewhere
else-- Jens asked

00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:55.880
the agent guarding him where
she would run if she were him.

00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:57.430
The agent was standing
at the window,

00:13:57.430 --> 00:14:00.660
looking at the street, her
right hand on her holstered gun,

00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:02.870
her left hand holding
the radio to her ear.

00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:04.540
With her free ear,
she must have been

00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:06.350
listening for the sound
of Jens's suitcase

00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:07.740
shutting and latching.

00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:10.770
And when she didn't hear it,
she turned around and said,

00:14:10.770 --> 00:14:11.970
'Hurry.'

00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:14.120
Long before this, Jens
had been handed off

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:16.490
by the Danish Security
and Intelligence Service

00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:19.690
to a series of agents who
spoke to Jens and each other

00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:22.140
in an accent that could have
meant they were Americans

00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:24.181
or could have meant they
learned to speak English

00:14:24.181 --> 00:14:25.820
from watching American TV.

00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:29.600
As for Jens, his English was
both unaccented and perfect,

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:31.950
as it was, of course,
required to be

00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:34.440
by the Danish
educational system.

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:36.190
He shut his suitcase
and asked her,

00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:39.040
'Where are we going now?'
The agent looked back out

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:42.180
the window and sighed in a way
that seemed intended to let

00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:45.660
Jens know how peeved she was
that he and his little cartoon

00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:48.610
had put her in a position where
she was forced to actually do

00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:51.510
her incredibly boring
and dangerous job.

00:14:51.510 --> 00:14:53.870
'You know about as much
as I do,' she said.

00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:56.570
This, of course, was
completely untrue.

00:14:56.570 --> 00:14:58.740
As with everyone
who kept him safe,

00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:00.710
she knew exactly
why he had to leave

00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:02.340
and where he was going next.

00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:04.090
As with every one
of his safekeepers,

00:15:04.090 --> 00:15:05.787
she never told
him what she knew,

00:15:05.787 --> 00:15:08.120
including why he had to keep
running if everyone thought

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:09.580
he was already dead.

00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:11.970
'Credible threat,' was all
she would say when he asked.

00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:13.630
'There's a credible threat.'

00:15:13.630 --> 00:15:15.750
As with every one
of his safekeepers,

00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:18.057
this made Jens totally
dependent upon her.

00:15:18.057 --> 00:15:20.390
And it also made him fall in
love with her a little bit.

00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:22.680
And it also made him want
to go somewhere remote where

00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:24.640
he would never see her again.

00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:27.300
'If you were me and you wanted
to go somewhere so remote that

00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:29.530
no one would ever find
you,' Jens asked her,

00:15:29.530 --> 00:15:32.520
'where would you run?'
Without hesitation, she said,

00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:35.180
'Broomeville.' 'Where?' he said.

00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:36.960
'Exactly,' she said."

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:37.460
OK.

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:39.126
So this is about to
move to Broomeville.

00:15:39.126 --> 00:15:41.850
Broomeville's a town I made
up in upstate New York that's

00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:43.900
a little bit modeled on
a town called Boonville

00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:46.220
that I very cleverly
disguised by adding

00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:48.000
a consonant and a vowel.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.060
They're never going to find out.

00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:52.550
Yeah, this is Chapter 5.

00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:55.710
"Matty was in his office, even
though it was a Friday night.

00:15:55.710 --> 00:15:58.080
Outside it was dark, dark.

00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:00.120
Inside, the overhead
lights were flickering

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:02.910
like there were small animals
up there chewing on something

00:16:02.910 --> 00:16:05.130
important or just
running back and forth,

00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:06.880
enjoying their
Friday night, having

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:10.395
a good time messing around with
the long fluorescent tubes.

00:16:10.395 --> 00:16:12.770
'I'm not even supposed to be
thinking about you,' he said

00:16:12.770 --> 00:16:14.920
into his cellphone,
'let alone talking

00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:17.380
to you.' 'So don't
talk,' she said.

00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:19.120
'Just listen.'

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:20.430
So Matty did that.

00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:22.585
She talked for a long
time, long enough

00:16:22.585 --> 00:16:25.210
for him to understand that after
she'd ended their affair seven

00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:27.370
years earlier,
she'd been so angry

00:16:27.370 --> 00:16:30.400
at him and at Broomeville,
and at the fucking world,

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:32.870
that she decided to
go work for the CIA,

00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:34.590
long enough for
him to understand

00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:37.290
that in her capacity
as a CIA agent,

00:16:37.290 --> 00:16:39.540
and his capacity as
an American citizen,

00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:41.970
she wanted him to
do her a favor,

00:16:41.970 --> 00:16:44.240
long enough for him to
get up out of his chair,

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:46.640
walk out of his office,
out of the building,

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:48.140
out into the parking lot.

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:51.430
He kept turning in circles
while he listened to her talk.

00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:54.460
Way off to the west was the
big dark nothing of the lake.

00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:57.300
To the east was the big dark
nothing of the mountains.

00:16:57.300 --> 00:17:00.220
A half mile to the north was
the town, the little square

00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:02.270
that was actually more
like a trapezoid--

00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:06.859
the gazebo, the monument, the
diner, the bar, the other bar,

00:17:06.859 --> 00:17:09.550
his house, which,
before they died,

00:17:09.550 --> 00:17:11.690
had been his parents'
house, the river that

00:17:11.690 --> 00:17:13.670
eventually ran into the lake.

00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:16.569
Right in front of him to the
south was the Broomeville,

00:17:16.569 --> 00:17:18.770
New York junior/senior
high school.

00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:20.520
But from where was she calling?

00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:22.609
What direction was she?

00:17:22.609 --> 00:17:25.579
Anyway, when she was
done talking, Matty said,

00:17:25.579 --> 00:17:28.210
'You've got to be kidding me.'
'You sound different,' she

00:17:28.210 --> 00:17:28.910
said.

00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:32.580
'Are you outside now or
something?' 'The CIA?' he said.

00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:34.940
'I bet you're standing in
the parking lot,' she said.

00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:37.450
'How does someone just
end up in the CIA?'

00:17:37.450 --> 00:17:39.760
'The old Broomeville
junior/senior high parking

00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:43.010
lot.' 'The sky is full
of stars here,' he said.

00:17:43.010 --> 00:17:45.890
'The sky is full of stars
here too,' she said.

00:17:45.890 --> 00:17:49.550
'Are you outside?' 'No, but I'm
just guessing.' 'What exactly

00:17:49.550 --> 00:17:52.040
did this guy do, anyway?'
'I can't tell you

00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:54.110
that.' 'Why not?'

00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:56.069
She didn't say
anything right away.

00:17:56.069 --> 00:17:57.860
The only thing he could
hear was breathing,

00:17:57.860 --> 00:17:59.950
and he wondered, why
is it that when someone

00:17:59.950 --> 00:18:01.400
breathes in your
ear on the phone,

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:03.062
it's either sexy or sinister.

00:18:03.062 --> 00:18:04.520
But when someone
does it in person,

00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:06.480
it's mostly just annoying?

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:09.130
'Because I don't want
to,' she finally said.

00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:10.345
'Fair enough,' Matty said.

00:18:10.345 --> 00:18:12.075
And immediately, he
wished he hadn't.

00:18:12.075 --> 00:18:14.610
She had once accused
him of saying that,

00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:17.760
'fair enough,' way too often
and in response to things that

00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:19.150
weren't fair enough at all.

00:18:19.150 --> 00:18:20.774
And then they'd gotten
into a big fight

00:18:20.774 --> 00:18:23.840
about it, his just being, did
she have to be such a bitch?

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:25.370
And hers just
being, she wouldn't

00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:26.869
have to be such a
bitch if he didn't

00:18:26.869 --> 00:18:29.000
say 'fair enough' all the time.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.130
'There are no jobs,' he said.

00:18:31.130 --> 00:18:32.170
'Then fire someone.

00:18:32.170 --> 00:18:34.670
There has to be at least one
person there who deserves to be

00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:37.310
fired.' 'There's
no one,' he said.

00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:40.270
But too late, he was
already thinking of someone.

00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:43.670
'I'm not giving your buddy
a job,' he said, anyway.

00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:45.770
'Any old job will do,' she said.

00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:49.550
'And he's not my buddy.'
'No,' Matty said.

00:18:49.550 --> 00:18:51.110
'Let me just make two points.

00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:53.510
He's an internationally
wanted criminal.' 'He's not

00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:56.210
a criminal, Matthew,' she
said, 'unless being clueless is

00:18:56.210 --> 00:18:58.940
a crime.' 'But he is
internationally wanted,' Matty

00:18:58.940 --> 00:18:59.580
said.

00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:01.320
'People are trying
to assassinate him,

00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:03.540
and you want me to give
him a job in a school,

00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:05.300
a school full of children.'

00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:07.030
'But that's one of
my points,' she said.

00:19:07.030 --> 00:19:09.100
'People are trying to
assassinate him here.

00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:11.190
People get assassinated
here all the time,

00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:13.010
but no one ever
gets assassinated

00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:16.240
in America.' 'What about Martin
Luther King Jr.?' he said.

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:17.920
'What about Abraham Lincoln?'

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:20.480
'Well, there are obviously
exceptions,' she admitted.

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:23.460
'What about the Kennedys?'
'Fair enough,' she said.

00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:25.080
And then they both laughed.

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:26.990
'I have missed you,' Matty said.

00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:29.920
'That's my other
point,' she said."

00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:31.220
OK.

00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:35.460
So Matty gives her-- he
fires his guidance counselor

00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:38.800
and then gives the cartoonist
the job as the guidance

00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:40.644
counselor, because
that would happen.

00:19:40.644 --> 00:19:42.060
I chose that because
no one really

00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:43.900
knows what the hell
guidance counselors do.

00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:45.510
And so I'd seen them as
the most mysterious job

00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:47.280
I could give him, in
my opinion, at least.

00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:48.600
I've just offended
probably someone

00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:49.690
who's related to a
guidance counselor.

00:19:49.690 --> 00:19:51.481
I actually gave a talk
once, and this woman

00:19:51.481 --> 00:19:53.060
got up at that
moment-- when I just

00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:54.030
said that-- and walked out.

00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:56.155
And she was a guidance
counselor, as it turned out.

00:19:56.155 --> 00:19:58.230
So you'd think I would learn.

00:19:58.230 --> 00:20:00.840
And I haven't learned.

00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:05.680
And then so fast forward a
few days, and Jens shows up.

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:08.980
His identity is--
he's now Henry Larson.

00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:10.210
He's got a fake name.

00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:14.020
And he's also pretending to
be a Swede and not a Dane

00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:16.560
because the theory is his
English is too good to be

00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:18.000
anything but a Swede or a Dane.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.480
And so obviously, it's
better to be a Swede.

00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:21.980
Yeah.

00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:23.130
Matty's the principal.

00:20:23.130 --> 00:20:25.020
That you have.

00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:29.710
And Henry/Jens is now speaking
to Matty's wife, Ellen,

00:20:29.710 --> 00:20:32.680
who's the owner and proprietor
of the bar, the Lumber Lodge,

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:36.480
in town, one of the two bars.

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:37.230
Everyone got that?

00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:37.871
Yeah.

00:20:37.871 --> 00:20:38.370
It's real.

00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:41.430
It's an autobiographical
novel, clearly.

00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:43.410
"By the time they got
outside the Lumber Lodge,

00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:44.710
it was snowing.

00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:47.940
'Snowing?' Evidently,
Ellen felt the same way.

00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:49.370
'Snowing,' she said.

00:20:49.370 --> 00:20:52.320
But then she looked up and
got a snowflake in the eye.

00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:53.710
'Oh, wow,' she said.

00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:55.310
She blinked rapidly
and then began

00:20:55.310 --> 00:20:57.580
tugging at the underside
of her right eye.

00:20:57.580 --> 00:20:59.120
'Does it hurt?' Henry asked.

00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:01.720
'It's only snow,'
Ellen said, 'but yeah,

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:03.010
it does hurt a little.'

00:21:03.010 --> 00:21:06.760
She tugged her eye again, then
blinked slowly, once, twice,

00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:07.690
three times.

00:21:07.690 --> 00:21:10.160
'I really should wear
glasses,' she said.

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:13.207
'They would protect your eyes
from the snow,' Henry said.

00:21:13.207 --> 00:21:15.290
And Ellen blinked once
more and then looked at him

00:21:15.290 --> 00:21:16.650
with wide eyes.

00:21:16.650 --> 00:21:18.920
'Instead of
contacts,' Ellen said.

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:20.287
'Contacts?' Henry thought.

00:21:20.287 --> 00:21:22.120
And then he thought--"
this will be obvious,

00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:25.460
I don't speak Danish, in a
second-- "and then he thought,

00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:27.660
'Kontaktlinsers.'
He wore them too,

00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:29.840
special kontaktlinsers
that helped correct his

00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:33.630
nearsightedness and also
made his blue eyes brown.

00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:36.030
Anyway, it apparently had
been snowing for a while

00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:38.250
because there was a rusty
blue pickup truck parked

00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:40.390
in front of the Lumber
Lodge, and its windshield

00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:41.970
was covered with snow.

00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:44.730
Ellen got into the driver's
side of the truck and Henry

00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:46.440
into the passenger side.

00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:49.220
Ellen then did several
things in quick succession.

00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:51.090
First, she put the
key into the ignition

00:21:51.090 --> 00:21:52.880
and turned it, which
started the truck

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:55.040
with a roar and then a rattle.

00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:57.030
Then she turned the
windshield wipers on,

00:21:57.030 --> 00:22:01.620
but the snow was crusted on the
glass and wouldn't wipe off.

00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:03.270
Henry offered to
get out and scrape,

00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:04.750
but Ellen waved him off.

00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:06.570
'It's cold out there,' she said.

00:22:06.570 --> 00:22:08.690
Then Ellen turned
on the defrost,

00:22:08.690 --> 00:22:11.170
and cold air came
blasting into the truck.

00:22:11.170 --> 00:22:13.080
Then she turned on the radio.

00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:14.550
A man's voice came out.

00:22:14.550 --> 00:22:16.220
He was talking
about the weather.

00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:17.630
They listened for a few seconds.

00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:19.670
And then Ellen punched
a button on the radio,

00:22:19.670 --> 00:22:21.800
and another man's
voice came out.

00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:23.470
Henry recognized it immediately.

00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:25.400
Sports talk radio
sounds the same

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:27.070
no matter what
language it's spoken in

00:22:27.070 --> 00:22:29.390
and what sport is
being discussed.

00:22:29.390 --> 00:22:31.330
They listened to that
for a few seconds.

00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:33.120
And then Ellen punched
another button,

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:36.810
and another man's voice came
out talking about politics.

00:22:36.810 --> 00:22:38.810
After a few seconds
of listening to that,

00:22:38.810 --> 00:22:40.550
Ellen turned off the radio.

00:22:40.550 --> 00:22:42.560
She lit a cigarette
and smoked it halfway

00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:44.980
to the filter before
glancing at Henry.

00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:47.740
The glance was half
dare, half apology.

00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:50.730
'Matty doesn't like to
see me smoke,' she said.

00:22:50.730 --> 00:22:52.930
Finally, she put
the car in gear.

00:22:52.930 --> 00:22:55.260
To Henry, all this
seemed like preparations

00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:56.780
for a very long journey.

00:22:56.780 --> 00:22:59.340
But not even a minute later,
Ellen stopped the truck

00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:02.080
and said, 'We're here.'

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:04.410
In this way, Henry
learned several things,

00:23:04.410 --> 00:23:07.250
that once Americans were out of
the cold and in their trucks,

00:23:07.250 --> 00:23:09.474
they did not like to get
back out into the cold,

00:23:09.474 --> 00:23:11.890
even if it meant making the
inside of their trucks as cold

00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:14.700
as the outside, that American
weathermen like to refer

00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:18.430
to snow as 'the white stuff,'
that American sports talk radio

00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:20.370
announcers like to
say about something,

00:23:20.370 --> 00:23:22.520
'there's no doubt about
it,' before then expressing

00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:25.650
their many doubts about it, that
American political commentators

00:23:25.650 --> 00:23:27.360
like to preface their
comments by saying,

00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:30.400
'no offense,' before then
saying something offensive.

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:33.200
The political commentator on the
radio had said to whomever he

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:36.330
was talking to, 'No offense,
but you have to be the stupidest

00:23:36.330 --> 00:23:38.210
human being on the planet.'

00:23:38.210 --> 00:23:40.010
That Americans were
very impatient people

00:23:40.010 --> 00:23:42.724
with very short attention
spans, that Americans believed

00:23:42.724 --> 00:23:44.640
that as long as they
were inside their trucks,

00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:47.260
they were invisible, that as
long as they smoked cigarettes

00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:48.926
inside their trucks,
they would not then

00:23:48.926 --> 00:23:51.290
smell like cigarettes once
they exited their trucks,

00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:53.665
and that, in general, Americans
thought their trucks were

00:23:53.665 --> 00:23:56.070
magic, that while
Europeans tended to think

00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:58.590
of Americans as people who
like to drive incredibly

00:23:58.590 --> 00:24:01.217
long distances in their
pickup trucks, in fact,

00:24:01.217 --> 00:24:03.300
Americans like to drive
incredibly short distances

00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:05.120
in their trucks as well.

00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:07.750
These were the lessons Henry
learned about Americans

00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:09.780
during his first minute
in Ellen's truck.

00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:12.700
And not once was he forced
to reconsider them during all

00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:15.160
his days in Broomeville.

00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:18.590
Ellen put the truck in park, but
its engine was still running,

00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:20.140
its wipers still wiping.

00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:22.570
It was difficult to
see anything but snow.

00:24:22.570 --> 00:24:24.680
The truck headlights
were full of it.

00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:26.970
'Does it always snow this
much here?' he asked.

00:24:26.970 --> 00:24:27.520
'Why?

00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:30.740
Doesn't it snow like this where
you're from too?' 'No,' Henry

00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:31.740
said.

00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:35.650
'Really?' Ellen said, 'because
when I see Sweden, I see snow.'

00:24:35.650 --> 00:24:37.310
'Of course, of
course,' Henry said.

00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:40.470
'But then, I'm from southern
Sweden.' 'It doesn't snow

00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:43.030
in southern Sweden?'
'It does, but not often

00:24:43.030 --> 00:24:46.330
in October.' 'It doesn't usually
snow this much in October here

00:24:46.330 --> 00:24:47.830
either,' Ellen said.

00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:50.200
She turned off the truck
and the headlights too.

00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:51.770
But still, there was snow.

00:24:51.770 --> 00:24:54.680
Still, there was light, not
too far in front of them

00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:58.070
and much higher off the
ground, a ring of light towers.

00:24:58.070 --> 00:24:59.450
Henry supposed
they had something

00:24:59.450 --> 00:25:01.160
to do with this baseball game.

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:03.600
In a moment, he and Ellen
would get out of the car

00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:05.550
and start walking
in that direction.

00:25:05.550 --> 00:25:06.550
And what then?

00:25:06.550 --> 00:25:08.790
Something is about to
happen, Henry thought.

00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:10.124
But what is about to happen?

00:25:10.124 --> 00:25:11.790
He wanted to reach
across the bench seat

00:25:11.790 --> 00:25:13.290
to grab Ellen's hand.

00:25:13.290 --> 00:25:16.820
But instead, he said, 'It's
beautiful.' 'Snow is always

00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:18.960
beautiful in October,' she said.

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:21.237
'I really think I'm going
to like it here,' he said.

00:25:21.237 --> 00:25:23.320
'OK, listen,' Ellen said.
'You shouldn't talk like

00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:26.030
that.' 'Talk like
what?' Henry asked.

00:25:26.030 --> 00:25:28.870
He seemed genuinely, almost
pedagogically concerned.

00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:30.685
And if he had a
pad of paper, Ellen

00:25:30.685 --> 00:25:33.580
was sure he would have started
taking notes on the subject.

00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:35.930
In fact, he reached
into his jacket pocket

00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:39.000
as though looking for
something to write on and with.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.200
And then he reached into
the other jacket pocket.

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:43.040
There was clearly
nothing in either.

00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:45.470
Then he looked even
more concerned.

00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:48.640
Ellen didn't think she'd ever
seen a face like that, so wide

00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:49.390
open.

00:25:49.390 --> 00:25:50.860
Ellen didn't think
she'd ever seen

00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:52.940
someone who clearly
wanted advice,

00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:54.700
who wanted to be helped.

00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:57.550
'Like you talk,' Ellen said, 'I
really think I'm going to like

00:25:57.550 --> 00:25:58.091
it here.

00:25:58.091 --> 00:26:00.340
If you say things like that,
these people will eat you

00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:04.960
alive.' 'Even the students?'
'Especially them.' 'What should

00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:08.461
I say?' 'Maybe you shouldn't
say anything,' she said.

00:26:08.461 --> 00:26:10.710
Ellen remembered when Kurt--"
Kurt's her teenage son--

00:26:10.710 --> 00:26:11.920
"when Kurt was younger.

00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:13.545
She would say something
he didn't like,

00:26:13.545 --> 00:26:16.220
and he would just stand
there with his arms crossed,

00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:18.640
frowning, evidently waiting
for her to say something

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:21.030
else, which she inevitably did.

00:26:21.030 --> 00:26:22.750
She explained this to Henry.

00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:24.730
'You should just go
like this,' she said.

00:26:24.730 --> 00:26:26.250
And then she demonstrated.

00:26:26.250 --> 00:26:27.450
Henry did it back.

00:26:27.450 --> 00:26:29.920
And when he did, Ellen
thought of a younger Kurt,

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:32.180
and a younger Matty,
and a younger self.

00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:34.130
Then suddenly, she
became so lonely

00:26:34.130 --> 00:26:36.540
for that time and those people.

00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:38.230
'Are you all
right?' Henry asked.

00:26:38.230 --> 00:26:40.370
'I've been a little
lonely,' she said.

00:26:40.370 --> 00:26:42.020
Henry didn't say anything back.

00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:43.520
He just frowned at
her, as though he

00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:46.380
disapproved of the inaccuracy
of her declaration.

00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:48.000
'I'm so lonely,' she said.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.930
'I've been so lonely for
such a long time.' Still,

00:26:51.930 --> 00:26:53.210
Henry frowned.

00:26:53.210 --> 00:26:54.760
Ellen remembered this now.

00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:57.100
She remembered feeling that
she would have done anything

00:26:57.100 --> 00:26:59.990
or said anything to get
that look off Kurt's face,

00:26:59.990 --> 00:27:01.330
even tell the truth.

00:27:01.330 --> 00:27:03.900
'I've been so lonely, ever
since Matty told me he'd been

00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:06.470
cheating on me.' The
frown disappeared.

00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:09.810
'That's more like it,'
Henry's face seemed to say."

00:27:09.810 --> 00:27:11.220
OK.

00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:15.030
Two years later, Henry is
engaged to be married to Ellen.

00:27:15.030 --> 00:27:15.950
Ellen has left Matty.

00:27:15.950 --> 00:27:17.825
And this becomes more
and more soap opera-ish

00:27:17.825 --> 00:27:18.930
the more I speak about it.

00:27:18.930 --> 00:27:22.515
And anyways, Tarik, who's the
young man who's burned down

00:27:22.515 --> 00:27:24.390
the cartoonist's house
is wracked with guilt,

00:27:24.390 --> 00:27:26.265
because he thinks he's
killed the cartoonist.

00:27:26.265 --> 00:27:30.160
And so he's going to hunt
down-- find what he thinks

00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:31.799
is the widow and confess to her.

00:27:31.799 --> 00:27:33.340
He's not been arrested
all this time.

00:27:33.340 --> 00:27:35.130
The high school, by
the way, that Henry's

00:27:35.130 --> 00:27:36.940
about to be employed
in or is employed in,

00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:40.370
is full of CIA agents who
are posing as social studies

00:27:40.370 --> 00:27:44.619
teachers, and
janitors, and such.

00:27:44.619 --> 00:27:46.160
It's a ridiculous
book, if that's not

00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:47.880
totally clear by now.

00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:49.280
All right, I said, Tarik.

00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:49.870
I'm sorry.

00:27:49.870 --> 00:27:51.661
Tarik is one of the
two men who burned down

00:27:51.661 --> 00:27:52.710
the newspaper's offices.

00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:57.350
Soren is the guy who's
about to apologize.

00:27:57.350 --> 00:27:59.600
"Soren thought it would
probably be difficult to find

00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:02.606
the address of the widow of
a cartoonist whom he murdered

00:28:02.606 --> 00:28:03.980
in what the
newspapers had called

00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:06.846
a 'terrorist firebombing.'
But that was not the case.

00:28:06.846 --> 00:28:09.220
It hadn't been difficult to
find the cartoonist's address

00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:09.854
either.

00:28:09.854 --> 00:28:11.270
It hadn't been
difficult for Soren

00:28:11.270 --> 00:28:13.220
to burn his house
down or for Tarik

00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:15.260
to burn down the
newspaper's offices.

00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:17.610
It hadn't even been difficult
for them to escape capture

00:28:17.610 --> 00:28:19.910
after the firebombing,
after the newspapers had

00:28:19.910 --> 00:28:23.604
reported that the cartoonist had
died in the fire Soren had set.

00:28:23.604 --> 00:28:26.145
No one from the police or the
Danish Security or Intelligence

00:28:26.145 --> 00:28:28.320
Service had ever
questioned them,

00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:30.622
even though there were
barely any Muslims in Skagen,

00:28:30.622 --> 00:28:32.830
and even though it had been
the only murder committed

00:28:32.830 --> 00:28:36.610
in Skagen that year, and the
year before that, and so on.

00:28:36.610 --> 00:28:40.480
'Murder, murder, blood, blood,'
that was the difficult part,

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:42.980
having the words 'murder' and
'blood' crawl through his head

00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:44.277
for the past four years.

00:28:44.277 --> 00:28:45.860
Although he supposed
the murder hadn't

00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:47.830
been easy for the
cartoonist either,

00:28:47.830 --> 00:28:49.500
not to mention his widow.

00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:52.840
Anyway, she lived in Aarhus,
just a couple of hours south.

00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:55.300
The newspaper reports
had given him her name.

00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:57.490
The internet had
given him her address

00:28:57.490 --> 00:28:59.460
and then directions
how to get there.

00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:03.030
But first, Soren had to
borrow his dad's car.

00:29:03.030 --> 00:29:05.630
So he went home, which was less
than a mile from the boatyard

00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:08.840
where he and Tarik worked,
right across the street from OC

00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:12.370
Trawl, where his father
worked making fishing nets.

00:29:12.370 --> 00:29:14.590
His house was the house in
which Soren had grown up

00:29:14.590 --> 00:29:16.840
and in which he still lived.

00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:20.000
It was yellow, of course, and
had a red tile roof, also,

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:20.980
of course.

00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:23.350
His parents' names
were Faruk and Benan,

00:29:23.350 --> 00:29:25.950
but they had named him Soren,
although their last name was

00:29:25.950 --> 00:29:27.060
Korkmaz.

00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:29.810
As far as Soren
was concerned, they

00:29:29.810 --> 00:29:33.240
might as well have named
him Dane, Son of Turks.

00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:35.027
Soren walked in the front door.

00:29:35.027 --> 00:29:36.860
His father was sitting
on the couch watching

00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:39.030
professional handball on TV.

00:29:39.030 --> 00:29:40.957
Handball was his
father's favorite sport,

00:29:40.957 --> 00:29:43.540
even though he didn't understand
the rules because pretty much

00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:45.390
no one understood the rules.

00:29:45.390 --> 00:29:49.230
You were allowed to run and leap
and catch and hurl the ball,

00:29:49.230 --> 00:29:53.030
except in some circumstances,
for some mysterious reasons,

00:29:53.030 --> 00:29:55.430
when these activities
were forbidden.

00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:57.910
'Kolding and Aalborg,'
Soren's father said.

00:29:57.910 --> 00:30:01.610
'Don't tell me who won' 'What?'
'It was actually played last

00:30:01.610 --> 00:30:03.080
night,' Soren's father said.

00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:04.740
They were playing it on TV now.

00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:06.430
'Don't tell me who won.'

00:30:06.430 --> 00:30:08.540
Soren sat down next
to his father, who

00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:12.520
smelled of salt and fish,
even though the nets he made

00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:14.150
hadn't yet touch the sea.

00:30:14.150 --> 00:30:16.940
Or maybe it was Soren
himself who smelled that way.

00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:18.790
He watched the
handball for a minute.

00:30:18.790 --> 00:30:20.820
But then it started
to hurt his eyes,

00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:22.670
so he looked out
the front window.

00:30:22.670 --> 00:30:25.364
It was dark and darker
still with the fog, which

00:30:25.364 --> 00:30:26.530
came right up to the window.

00:30:29.890 --> 00:30:32.770
A deep-throated horn
blew out there somewhere,

00:30:32.770 --> 00:30:34.400
and the fog seemed
to get somehow

00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:36.086
even thicker against the pane.

00:30:36.086 --> 00:30:37.460
It was one of
those times when it

00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:40.200
was difficult to imagine
that it wasn't 6 o'clock

00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:41.870
everywhere in the world.

00:30:41.870 --> 00:30:45.200
Soren turned back to the TV and
saw a bunch of rangey white men

00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:48.500
in knee and elbow pads,
hugging each other.

00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:50.070
'Goal?' he said.

00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:52.330
'I believe so,' his father said.

00:30:52.330 --> 00:30:54.350
'I don't know how you
can watch this stuff.'

00:30:54.350 --> 00:30:55.500
His father shrugged.

00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:57.700
'It's better than
making nets,' he said.

00:30:57.700 --> 00:31:00.740
This was the way Soren's
father had always talked.

00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:03.320
Something was always
better than something else.

00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:06.680
When his wife, Soren's mother,
had died several years earlier

00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:09.870
of breast cancer, he'd gone
back to work making nets the day

00:31:09.870 --> 00:31:10.382
after.

00:31:10.382 --> 00:31:12.840
And when someone had asked him
how he could go back to work

00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:15.630
making nets so soon
after his wife's death,

00:31:15.630 --> 00:31:19.240
he had shrugged and said, 'It's
better than sitting at home.'

00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:21.530
'Can I borrow the car tomorrow
morning?' Soren asked.

00:31:21.530 --> 00:31:24.960
And then he added, 'Don't look
at me like that.' 'Look at you

00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:29.010
like what?' Soren's father said,
still looking at him like that.

00:31:29.010 --> 00:31:31.630
His father's look, it
had always been there.

00:31:31.630 --> 00:31:34.520
But it had gotten more
intense, more squirm-inducing,

00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:36.740
more knowing, since
Soren had accidentally

00:31:36.740 --> 00:31:38.350
murdered the cartoonist.

00:31:38.350 --> 00:31:40.321
Or was that just
Soren's imagination?

00:31:40.321 --> 00:31:42.820
In any case, Soren didn't know
how much longer he could take

00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:46.230
it, the look, the look, the look
that was made up of a litanies

00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:47.290
of don'ts.

00:31:47.290 --> 00:31:48.440
Don't disappoint me.

00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:49.710
Don't make me look bad.

00:31:49.710 --> 00:31:51.246
Don't make your people look bad.

00:31:51.246 --> 00:31:52.870
Don't you know we
moved to this country

00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:54.470
so you would be your own person?

00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:56.070
Don't be someone else's person.

00:31:56.070 --> 00:31:57.560
Don't forget that you're my son.

00:31:57.560 --> 00:31:59.010
Don't do anything stupid.

00:31:59.010 --> 00:32:00.140
Don't hurt the car.

00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:01.260
Don't hurt yourself.

00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:02.885
Don't you know that
your mother told me

00:32:02.885 --> 00:32:04.970
before she died not to let
anything happen to you?

00:32:04.970 --> 00:32:07.590
Don't you know I'd die if
something happened to you?

00:32:07.590 --> 00:32:08.900
Don't make me die.

00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:09.870
Don't kill me.

00:32:09.870 --> 00:32:11.160
Don't kill yourself.

00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:12.350
Don't kill anyone else.

00:32:12.350 --> 00:32:13.800
Don't get caught if you do.

00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:15.060
Don't do anything terrible.

00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:17.560
Don't you know that I love you
no matter what terrible thing

00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:18.400
you've done?

00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:19.480
Don't forget that.

00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:20.840
Don't do it again.

00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:21.980
Don't make it worse.

00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:24.350
Don't you know I know
everything about you?

00:32:24.350 --> 00:32:26.460
Don't cry, for crying out loud.

00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:28.360
Don't cry, because
then I'll cry.

00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:31.930
Just don't, don't, do not.

00:32:31.930 --> 00:32:35.010
'Just don't forget to put gas in
the car.' Soren's father said.

00:32:35.010 --> 00:32:37.490
And then he turned
back to his handball."

00:32:37.490 --> 00:32:40.210
I'm going to stop
there, I think.

00:32:40.210 --> 00:32:44.600
And I would be happy to take any
questions if you all have them.

00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:46.170
So what happens
then, briefly, is

00:32:46.170 --> 00:32:50.540
that the CIA agent, for a number
of reasons that only exist

00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:54.300
in novels, makes
Soren-- blackmails him

00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:58.670
into going to Broomefield
to try to kill Henry.

00:32:58.670 --> 00:33:02.030
And, yeah, that's the last
half of the book, the series

00:33:02.030 --> 00:33:04.420
of stories connected to that.

00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:05.030
Yeah.

00:33:05.030 --> 00:33:07.321
So I'd be happy to answer
questions if anyone has them.

00:33:10.335 --> 00:33:12.210
I mean, the question
would be, what the fuck?

00:33:12.210 --> 00:33:12.960
Right?

00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:14.290
That's the operative question.

00:33:14.290 --> 00:33:15.660
Were you saying yes back there?

00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:16.600
Is that your hand like that?

00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:17.100
Yeah.

00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:17.840
Yeah.

00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:19.423
AUDIENCE: I guess
I'll ask a question.

00:33:19.423 --> 00:33:20.910
BROCK CLARKE: Yeah, sure.

00:33:20.910 --> 00:33:22.566
AUDIENCE: Where
does it come from?

00:33:22.566 --> 00:33:24.645
Did it start fully
formed as a story?

00:33:24.645 --> 00:33:26.270
Did it start as an
idea of a character?

00:33:26.270 --> 00:33:27.670
How does it--

00:33:27.670 --> 00:33:31.430
BROCK CLARKE: It began
with my brief experience

00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:33.722
in Denmark, thinking about
it as the happiest place

00:33:33.722 --> 00:33:36.180
in the world, the home of the
happiest people in the world,

00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:39.880
and the irony of these cartoons
being drawn there, making

00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:41.575
these people really unhappy.

00:33:41.575 --> 00:33:43.840
But again, then I began
to think about my-- I

00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:46.930
quickly-- so I wanted
this book to exist

00:33:46.930 --> 00:33:49.830
not as a reaction, a
commentary on the cartoons,

00:33:49.830 --> 00:33:52.290
the reactions to the
commentary, but a story

00:33:52.290 --> 00:33:54.680
of these characters whose
lives had sort of gotten out

00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:57.689
of their control, and
partly, because they didn't

00:33:57.689 --> 00:33:58.980
realize they had other options.

00:33:58.980 --> 00:34:01.260
They believed that what
they did were inevitable

00:34:01.260 --> 00:34:02.427
and couldn't be objected to.

00:34:02.427 --> 00:34:04.635
And then once they realized
they were not inevitable,

00:34:04.635 --> 00:34:05.920
it was too late to fix them.

00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:08.139
I guess my novels and
my stories are always

00:34:08.139 --> 00:34:11.190
about people who don't realize
that there are other options.

00:34:11.190 --> 00:34:12.750
And then they're
the stories of them

00:34:12.750 --> 00:34:15.841
trying to live their lives,
despite the bad choices they've

00:34:15.841 --> 00:34:16.340
made.

00:34:16.340 --> 00:34:19.030
And then I just don't let them
because you set characters

00:34:19.030 --> 00:34:19.967
on a path.

00:34:19.967 --> 00:34:21.550
Then you should
actually let them stay

00:34:21.550 --> 00:34:22.770
on that path, no matter what.

00:34:22.770 --> 00:34:26.300
I guess maybe the other
question is, why send

00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:29.346
this guy to upstate New York?

00:34:29.346 --> 00:34:30.929
Part of the answer's
autobiographical.

00:34:30.929 --> 00:34:33.969
I'm from there, and I like
the cheap irony of someone

00:34:33.969 --> 00:34:35.719
from the happiest place
in the world going

00:34:35.719 --> 00:34:37.190
to the home of the
least happy people

00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:38.929
in the world, which is my
experience with upstate New

00:34:38.929 --> 00:34:39.739
York.

00:34:39.739 --> 00:34:42.239
I think perversely, that makes
me happy to be there, though.

00:34:42.239 --> 00:34:44.300
I like grouchy people.

00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:45.920
I also wanted to
write a spy novel

00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:47.880
in which the spies were
bumblers and in which

00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:52.579
the locales of the novel
were not Paris, Istanbul.

00:34:52.579 --> 00:34:53.870
They were not someplace exotic.

00:34:53.870 --> 00:34:59.230
They were someplace that the
world had forgot, and partly,

00:34:59.230 --> 00:35:01.550
to give myself a chance to
write about these places

00:35:01.550 --> 00:35:03.675
that no one in the world
really cares about, which,

00:35:03.675 --> 00:35:04.870
for me, is upstate New York.

00:35:04.870 --> 00:35:06.500
And the irony for me
is I wanted to see what

00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:07.850
this cartoonist would be like.

00:35:07.850 --> 00:35:10.050
He's gotten a new lease on life
in this terrible place, which

00:35:10.050 --> 00:35:11.680
makes him really
happy for a while.

00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:14.560
And I wanted to see what
effect he would have

00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:16.580
on the people in that town.

00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:19.560
I mean, I also wanted it to be
about American surveillance,

00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:20.540
American violence.

00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:21.999
It's, by far, the
most violent book

00:35:21.999 --> 00:35:23.831
I've ever written,
although you don't see it

00:35:23.831 --> 00:35:25.111
in any of the chapters I read.

00:35:25.111 --> 00:35:27.610
I wanted to see-- I wanted to
think about these things going

00:35:27.610 --> 00:35:28.985
on in America,
but I did not want

00:35:28.985 --> 00:35:31.460
to do a straightforward
commentary on those things.

00:35:31.460 --> 00:35:34.282
I wanted to do things that would
surprise the people who maybe

00:35:34.282 --> 00:35:36.115
had made up their minds
about these cartoons

00:35:36.115 --> 00:35:39.240
and the cartoonists
coming into the book.

00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:42.360
It's a long, convoluted answer
to a really precise question.

00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:42.930
Thank you.

00:35:42.930 --> 00:35:44.346
It's been really
great to be here.

00:35:44.346 --> 00:35:46.385
And, yeah, thank
you for having me.

00:35:46.385 --> 00:35:47.260
Thanks for listening.

00:35:47.260 --> 00:35:47.926
I appreciate it.

00:35:47.926 --> 00:35:48.920
Thanks.

00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:50.320
[APPLAUSE]
