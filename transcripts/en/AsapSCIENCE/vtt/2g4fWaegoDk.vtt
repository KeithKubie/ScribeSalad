00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.279
With 80% of infectious diseases spread by
our hands, it’s clear that washing them

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:08.919
is important. But, when it comes to your hygiene
and cleanliness, which method of drying is

00:00:08.919 --> 00:00:12.709
best? Using a classic paper towel, or the
hand dryer?

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:16.369
Well, you’ll be happy to know that if you
wash your hands properly with soap, nearly

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:21.300
all traces of bacteria will be removed, regardless
of how you dry them. But it’s when you don’t

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.720
wash properly, or even worse, only wash with
water, that how you dry your hands can make

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.099
all the difference. After all, the spread
of bacteria is more likely to occur with wet

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:34.780
skin, and rubbing your wet hands on your clothes
or touching the bathroom door can often contaminate

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:35.699
them even more.

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:40.230
It turns out, after multiple studies were
analyzed and compared, paper towels came out

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.269
victorious. Why? A lot of it has to do with
timing. The average air dryer requires nearly

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:50.640
45 seconds to reduce hand moisture by 97%,
whereas paper towel users achieve the same

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.149
thing in around only 10 seconds. But after
reviewing people’s behaviour, studies showed

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:59.879
that most individuals spent only 22 seconds
with an air dryer, leaving their hands less

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.680
than 70% dry. Paper towel users, on the other
hand, could achieve more than 85% dryness

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.440
with only 5 seconds.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.480
Friction also plays a key role in the removal
of bacteria, with much of it being transferred

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.940
right on to the paper towel. Conversely, some
studies have shown that hand dryers may actually

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.480
emit bacteria in their flow, because of the
contaminated air from the bathroom. Having

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:25.020
said that, air drying hands can be effective
if done thoroughly, and truthfully, you don’t

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.560
always have an option! Though some dryers
are much better than others, just make sure

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.140
you dry them fully, and it shouldn’t be
a major problem.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.070
What about the environment, you ask? Without
a doubt, new dryers are the environmentally

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.440
friendly option. Not only because they prevent
deforestation, but they actually use less

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.290
energy and have a lower carbon emission once
everything is taken into account. After all,

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:49.200
13 billion pounds of paper towel are used
every year in America alone - and that’s

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.370
their major pitfall.

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:54.670
So if you’re going to use paper towel, here’s
a quick tip that only requires one piece,

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:00.100
as suggested by advocate Joe Smith. After
washing your hands, shake them hard 12 times,

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.140
then fold the piece of paper in half, and
wipe like so. This is the optimal arrangement

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:11.000
to dry with the least amount of paper. Again,
shake your hands 12 times...fold, and dry.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.540
Now you have clean dry hands, with minimal
waste!
