00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:11.150
Our model is really predicated on the idea
that we need large-scale change.

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:14.000
We need system change, not tinkering at the
margins.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.220
We actually need to focus on a much broader
model of learning and working.

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.020
So in this model all learning should count.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.349
It shouldn't just be the kinds of learning
that you get when you go to a traditional

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:29.279
learning enterprise, a college or university.

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.809
Innovation is something that we've long talked
about but today innovation is really critical

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:37.590
to success in the system.

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.370
We need innovation that actually focuses on
two key objectives.

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:48.789
The first one is time, that is the pace of
change that's happening today requires innovation

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:51.860
that is much more rapid than what we've seen
in the past.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.780
So we need more like a rapid prototyping model
of innovation than what we might have had

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.250
in the past where you would do some experiments,
do some innovation and then hope for some

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:02.250
change.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.540
The second important thing is scale.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:09.540
The nature of the change that's required is
actually going to have to be at scale.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.120
In other words, the innovation actually has
to be focused on the fact that it's going

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.570
to serve a large number of people â€“ that
it's actually going to solve large-scale social

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:20.570
problems.

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:26.230
So innovation in the past and particularly
philanthropic organizations trying to support

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:33.450
innovation have often been focused on germinating
new ideas with the hope that at some time

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.250
these things will achieve scale.

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.070
Today, we need to be focusing on innovation
that is actually going to take place much

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:45.300
more rapidly and is actually going to be focused,
from the get-go, on scale.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.220
Our objective in this work is quite simple.

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:53.900
First, we want to work with entrepreneurs
and discover the best ideas that are out there

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.790
that might help us achieve this large-scale
impact that we want to achieve.

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:03.000
The second is to elevate those ideas through
this partnership with Big Think in ways that

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.130
will give them a platform, give them visibility.

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.590
And the third is actually to work with the
entrepreneurs to achieve the scale impact

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.370
that's necessary.

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:21.070
And so our model here is to help uncover,
discover those big ideas, actually help to

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:25.790
elevate them and then work with the entrepreneurs
to achieve the scale that's needed.

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.959
So if you've got a big idea that you think
is going to address these challenges, we want

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:31.489
to hear from you.

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:37.069
We want to get your ideas and actually help
you develop them.

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:43.319
So under this Lumina Prize we'll actually
fly two innovators to New York for coaching

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:48.180
and a video interview that will allow you
to actually create a platform for this work,

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.190
for the idea that you have, to help it be
seen by millions of people.

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.180
There's a great opportunity here, not just
for Lumina Foundation and what we're trying

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.510
to achieve through our efforts as a national
leadership organization, but there's also

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.379
benefits for others.

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:08.299
Obviously, the entrepreneurs we want to work
with through this process are going to achieve

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:12.829
great benefit but so are the people who are
going to learn from this combination of what

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:16.840
Lumina is trying to do with these entrepreneurs
through the Big Think platform in ways that

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:23.739
will actually reach much broader audiences.
