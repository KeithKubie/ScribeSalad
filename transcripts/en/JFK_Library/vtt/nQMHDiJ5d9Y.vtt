00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.748
- Because there's some employers that say,

00:00:02.748 --> 00:00:07.600
you need not apply if you
don't have a college degree.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:08.597
Am I right, Chris?

00:00:08.597 --> 00:00:09.430
- Yeah.

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:10.994
That's been, I think, of
employers, Mike brought this

00:00:10.994 --> 00:00:12.448
up in his question to the employer.

00:00:12.448 --> 00:00:15.081
We'll just treat a college
degree as, you know,

00:00:15.081 --> 00:00:16.228
anti-money.

00:00:16.228 --> 00:00:18.100
Like, prove to me you're
serious enough about skills

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.264
that you finished college,

00:00:19.264 --> 00:00:20.541
and then I'll consider your application.

00:00:20.541 --> 00:00:21.989
Not necessarily I'm going
to give you the job.

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:24.123
I just don't even want to
bother interviewing someone

00:00:24.123 --> 00:00:25.723
who didn't bother to finish college.

00:00:25.723 --> 00:00:27.485
That, of course, misses
the fact there are a lot of

00:00:27.485 --> 00:00:29.400
talented people who have good
reasons they didn't finish.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.625
Look, I think we have to
focus more on our skills

00:00:31.625 --> 00:00:33.435
than just degrees,

00:00:33.435 --> 00:00:35.253
but I also think we'd
be dishonest if we say

00:00:35.253 --> 00:00:37.654
when you make a million
dollars more over your lifetime

00:00:37.654 --> 00:00:39.984
if you're a four-year
college graduate than not,

00:00:39.984 --> 00:00:42.266
this is no time to say to poor kids,

00:00:42.266 --> 00:00:43.710
kids of color, first-generation kids,

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.766
well, college really isn't for everyone.

00:00:45.766 --> 00:00:48.004
So I'm a little bit on the,
yes, skills matter more,

00:00:48.004 --> 00:00:50.396
but let's get really worried
about kids who aren't

00:00:50.396 --> 00:00:52.798
getting that college opportunity
who need it and want it.
