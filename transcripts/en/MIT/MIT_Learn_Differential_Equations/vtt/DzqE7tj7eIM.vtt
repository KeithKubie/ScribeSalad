GILBERT STRANG: So today begins
eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:11.320
And the reason we
want those, need

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:17.540
those is to solve systems
of linear equations.

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:22.680
Systems meaning more than
one equation, n equations.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.090
n equal 2 in the examples here.

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.000
So eigenvalue is a number,
eigenvector is a vector.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.600
They're both hiding
in the matrix.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.640
Once we find them,
we can use them.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.600
Let me show you the reason
eigenvalues were created,

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:50.150
invented, discovered was solving
differential equations, which

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.330
is our purpose.

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:59.110
So why is now a vector-- so
this is a system of equations.

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.590
I'll do an example in a minute.

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.760
A is a matrix.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.460
So we have n equations,
n components of y.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:15.550
And A is an n by n
matrix, n rows, n columns.

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:16.660
Good.

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.600
And now I can tell you
right away where eigenvalues

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.670
and eigenvectors pay off.

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.160
They come into the solution.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.800
We look for solutions
of that kind.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.790
When we had one equation,
we looked for solutions

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.890
just e to the st, and
we found that number s.

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.540
Now we have e to the
lambda t-- we changed s

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.120
to lambda, no problem--
but multiplied by a vector

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.610
because our unknown is a vector.

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.830
This is a vector, but that
does not depend on time.

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.510
That's the beauty of it.

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:59.330
All the time dependence is in
the exponential, as always.

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:05.870
And x is just multiples of that
exponential, as you'll see.

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:08.550
So I look for
solutions like that.

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.970
I plug that into the
differential equation

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.510
and what happens?

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.140
So here's my equation.

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.110
I'm plugging in what e to
the lambda tx, that's y.

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.520
That's A times y there.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.480
Now, the derivative of
y, the time derivative,

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.750
brings down a lambda.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.520
To get the derivative
I include the lambda.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.850
So do you see that
substituting into the equation

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:43.360
with this nice notation is
just this has to be true.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.050
My equation changed
to that form.

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:51.430
OK Now I cancel either
the lambda t, just the way

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.980
I was always
canceling e to the st.

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.700
So I cancel e to the lambda
t because it's never zero.

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:04.080
And I have the big
equation, Ax, the matrix

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.920
times my eigenvector,
is equal to lambda

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:13.680
x-- the number, the eigenvalue,
times the eigenvector.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.140
Not linear, notice.

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.210
Two unknowns here
that are multiplied.

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:21.820
A number, lambda,
times a vector, x.

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.960
So what am I looking for?

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:29.440
I'm looking for vectors x,
the eigenvectors, so that

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:36.700
multiplying by A-- multiplying A
times x gives a number times x.

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.870
It's in the same direction as
x just the length is changed.

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.590
Well, if lambda was 1,
I would have Ax equal x.

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:47.850
That's allowed.

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.400
If lambda is 0, I
would have Ax equals 0.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.810
That's all right.

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.640
I don't want x to be 0.

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.085
That's useless.

00:03:57.085 --> 00:04:01.780
That's no help to know
that 0 is a solution.

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.070
So x should be not 0.

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:06.990
Lambda can be any number.

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:09.880
It can be real, it
could be complex number,

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.120
as you will see.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.860
Even if the matrix is real,
lambda could be complex.

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.190
Anyway, Ax equal lambda x.

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.029
That's the big equation.

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:21.690
It got a box around it.

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:26.820
So now I'm ready
to do an example.

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.460
And in this example,
first of all,

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.670
I'm going to spot the
eigenvalues and eigenvectors

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:39.090
without a system, just go
for it in the 2 by 2 case.

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.360
So I'll give a 2 by 2 matrix
A. We'll find the lambdas

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:48.690
and the x's, and then we'll
have the solution to the system

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:50.180
of differential equations.

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.050
Good.

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.420
There's the system.

00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:00.620
There's the first equation for
y1-- prime meaning derivative,

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:06.220
d by dt, time derivative-- is
linear, a constant coefficient.

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:10.280
Second one, linear, constant
coefficient, 3 and 3.

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:15.540
Those numbers, 5, 1, 3,
3, go into the matrix.

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:21.970
Then that problem is exactly y
prime, the vector, derivative

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:25.890
of the vector, equal A times y.

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:27.380
That's my problem.

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:32.800
Now eigenvalues and
eigenvectors will solve it.

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.340
So I just look at that matrix.

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:37.870
Matrix question.

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:41.360
What are the eigenvalues,
what are the eigenvectors

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.270
of that matrix?

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:52.182
And remember, I want
Ax equals lambda x.

00:05:52.182 --> 00:05:55.680
I've spotted the
first eigenvector.

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.370
1, 1.

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:00.750
We could just
check does it work.

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:04.340
If I multiply A by
that eigenvector,

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:08.350
1, 1, do you see what
happens when I multiply by 1?

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:10.380
That gives me a 6.

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:12.700
That gives me a 6.

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:17.210
So A times that vector is 6, 6.

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:20.870
And that is 6 times 1, 1.

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:22.310
So there you go.

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:24.610
Found the first eigenvalue.

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:29.050
If I multiply A by
x, I get 6 by x.

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:31.420
I get the vector 6, 6.

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:33.440
Now, the second one.

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:39.170
Again, I've worked in advance,
produced this eigenvector,

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:42.220
and I think it's 1 minus 3.

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:46.430
So let's multiply by A.
Try the second eigenvector.

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:51.010
I should call this first
one maybe x1 and lambda 1.

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:54.070
And I should call this
one x2 and lambda 2.

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:58.400
And we can find out what
lambda 2 is, once I find

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.160
the eigenvectors of course.

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:06.060
I just do A times x to recognize
the lambda, the eigenvalue.

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:11.580
So 5, 1 times this
is 5 minus 3 is a 2.

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:14.250
It's a 2.

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:17.680
So here I got a 2.

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:25.020
And from 3, 3 it's 3
minus 9 is minus 6.

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:28.410
That's what I got for Ax.

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:31.020
There was the x.

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:34.920
When I did the multiplication,
Ax came out to be 2 minus 6.

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:36.360
Good.

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:41.380
That output is two
times the input.

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:44.050
The eigenvalue is 2.

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:45.370
Right?

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:49.560
I'm looking for inputs,
the eigenvector,

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:54.420
so that the output is a
number times that eigenvector,

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:57.730
and that number is
lambda, the eigenvalue.

00:07:57.730 --> 00:08:01.510
So I've now found the two.

00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:04.730
And I expect two
for a 2 by 2 matrix.

00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:08.820
You will soon see why I
expect two eigenvalues,

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:12.380
and each eigenvalue should
have an eigenvector.

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:17.050
So here they are
for this matrix.

00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:19.730
So I've got the answers now.

00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:28.400
y of t, which stands
for y1 and y2 of t.

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:36.280
Those are-- it's e
to the lambda tx.

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:39.470
Remember, that's the picture
that we're looking for.

00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:47.770
So the first one is e to the
6t times x, which is 1, 1.

00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:52.490
If I put that into the equation,
it will solve the equation.

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:55.502
Also, I have another one.

00:08:55.502 --> 00:09:00.330
e to the lambda 2 was 2t.

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:06.330
e to the lambda t times
its eigenvector, 1 minus 3.

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:08.520
That's a solution also.

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:10.490
One solution, another solution.

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:13.350
And what do I do with
linear equations?

00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:16.040
I take combinations.

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:21.090
Any number c1 of that,
plus any number c2 of that

00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:23.370
is still a solution.

00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:28.890
That's superposition, adding
solutions to linear equations.

00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:31.500
These are null equations.

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:35.130
There's no force term
in these equations.

00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:36.740
I'm not dealing
with a force term.

00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:40.800
I'm looking for the null
solutions, the solutions

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:43.320
of the equations themselves.

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:50.510
And there I have two solutions,
two coefficients to choose.

00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:52.290
How do I choose them?

00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:57.130
Of course, I match the initial
condition, so at t equals 0.

00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:01.700
At t equals 0.

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:06.710
At t equals 0, I
would have y of 0.

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:16.350
That's my given initial
condition, my y1 and y2.

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:20.480
So I'm setting t equals 0,
so that's one of course.

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:22.530
When t is 0, that's one.

00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:27.240
So I just have c1 times 1, 1.

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:38.980
And c2-- that's one again at
t equals o-- times 1 minus 3.

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:44.230
That's what
determines c1 and c2.

00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:47.800
c1 and c2 come from
the initial conditions

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:51.280
just the way they always did.

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:56.600
So I'm solving two first order
linear constant coefficient

00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:01.760
equations, homogeneous,
meaning no force term.

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:08.850
So I get a null solution
with constants to choose

00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:13.370
and, as always, those
constants come from matching

00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:15.690
the initial conditions.

00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:19.150
So the initial condition
here is a vector.

00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:27.580
So if, for example, y
of 0 was 2 minus 2, then

00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:32.500
I would want one of
those and one of those.

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:34.740
OK.

00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:37.650
I've used eigenvalues
and eigenvectors

00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:43.530
to solve a linear system, their
first and primary purpose.

00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:44.610
OK.

00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:49.240
But how do I find those
eigenvalues and eigenvectors?

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:51.250
What about other properties?

00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:54.220
What's going on with
eigenvalues and eigenvectors?

00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:58.340
May I begin on this just
a couple more minutes

00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:00.970
about eigenvalues
and eigenvectors?

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:07.390
Basic facts and then I'll come
next video of how to find them.

00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:10.000
OK, basic facts.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:10.910
Basic facts.

00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:21.570
So start from Ax
equals lambda x.

00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:25.350
Let's suppose we found those.

00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:28.620
Could you tell me the
eigenvalues and eigenvectors

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:29.480
of A squared?

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:38.690
I would like to know what the
eigenvalues and eigenvectors

00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:39.860
of A squared are.

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:42.190
Are they connected with these?

00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:48.240
So suppose I know the x and
I know the lambda for A. What

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:50.200
about for A squared?

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:53.800
Well, the good thing is
that the eigenvectors

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:56.210
are the same for A squared.

00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:58.570
So let me show you.

00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:06.650
I say that same x, so this
is the same x, same vector,

00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:07.980
same eigenvector.

00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:10.220
The eigenvalue would be
different, of course,

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:15.390
for A squared, but the
eigenvector is the same.

00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:18.050
And let's see what
happens for A squared.

00:13:18.050 --> 00:13:23.010
So that's A times Ax, right?

00:13:23.010 --> 00:13:26.090
One A, another Ax.

00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:30.132
But Ax is lambda x.

00:13:30.132 --> 00:13:31.090
Are you good with that?

00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:32.990
That's just A times Ax.

00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:34.970
So that's OK.

00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:37.250
Now lambda is a number.

00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:42.070
I like to bring it out
front where I can see it.

00:13:42.070 --> 00:13:44.440
So I didn't do anything there.

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:47.080
This number lambda was
multiplying everything

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:48.770
so I put it in front.

00:13:48.770 --> 00:13:49.740
Now Ax.

00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:52.020
I have, again, the Ax.

00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:54.830
That's, again, the
lambda x because I'm

00:13:54.830 --> 00:13:56.480
looking at the same x.

00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:59.220
Same x, so I get
the same lambda.

00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:02.120
So that's a lambda
x, another lambda.

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:05.150
I have lambda squared x.

00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:06.910
That's what I wanted.

00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:11.040
A squared x is lambda squared x.

00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:12.370
Conclusion.

00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:22.030
The eigenvectors stay the same,
lambda goes to lambda squared.

00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:24.450
The eigenvalues are squared.

00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:31.175
So if I had my example again--
oh, let me find that matrix.

00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:40.590
Suppose I had that
same matrix and I

00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:43.740
was interested in
A squared, then

00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:50.480
the eigenvalues would be
36 and 4, the squares.

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:53.300
I suppose I'm looking at
the n-th power of a matrix.

00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:55.780
You may say why look
at the n-th power?

00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:57.580
But there are many
examples to look

00:14:57.580 --> 00:15:01.340
at the n-th power of a
matrix, the thousandth power.

00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:04.670
So let's just write
down the conclusion.

00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:13.710
Same reasoning, A to
the n-th x is lambda.

00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:15.930
It's the same x.

00:15:15.930 --> 00:15:21.130
And every time I multiply by
A, I multiply by a lambda.

00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:22.920
So I get lambda n times.

00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:30.940
So there is the handy rule.

00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:33.340
And that really tells
us something about what

00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:35.070
eigenvalues are good for.

00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:39.880
Eigenvalues are good for
things that move in time.

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:45.450
Differential equations, that
is really moving in time.

00:15:45.450 --> 00:15:51.100
n equal 1 is this first time,
or n equals 0 is the start.

00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:55.470
Take one step to n equal 1,
take another step to n equal 2.

00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:56.480
Keep going.

00:15:56.480 --> 00:16:01.780
Every time step brings a
multiplication by lambda.

00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:06.840
So that is a very useful rule.

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:12.215
Another handy rule is what
about A plus the identity?

00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:23.870
Suppose I add the identity
matrix to my original matrix.

00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:25.620
What happens to the eigenvalues?

00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:27.290
What happens to
the eigenvectors?

00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:28.740
Basic question.

00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:33.030
Or I could multiply a constant
times the identity, 2 times

00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:35.820
the identity, 7
times the identity.

00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:39.890
And I want to know what
about its eigenvectors.

00:16:39.890 --> 00:16:45.260
And the answer is
same, same x's.

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:47.950
Same x.

00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:53.010
I show that by figuring
out what I have here.

00:16:53.010 --> 00:16:57.630
This is Ax, which is lambda x.

00:16:57.630 --> 00:17:00.850
And this is c times
the identity times x.

00:17:00.850 --> 00:17:05.760
The identity doesn't do
anything so that's just cx.

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:08.430
So what do I have now?

00:17:08.430 --> 00:17:16.319
I've seen that the
eigenvalue is lambda plus c.

00:17:16.319 --> 00:17:19.491
So there is the eigenvalues.

00:17:24.685 --> 00:17:30.100
I think about this as shifting
A by a multiple of the identity.

00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:34.830
Shifting A, adding 5
times the identity to it.

00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:38.780
If I add 5 times the
identity to any matrix,

00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:43.710
the eigenvalues of
that matrix go up by 5.

00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:46.800
And the eigenvectors
stay the same.

00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:51.650
So as long as I keep working
with that one matrix A.

00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:57.650
Taking powers, adding
multiples of the identity,

00:17:57.650 --> 00:18:02.050
later taking exponentials,
whatever I do I keep

00:18:02.050 --> 00:18:05.730
the same eigenvectors
and everything is easy.

00:18:10.910 --> 00:18:17.390
If I had two matrices, A and
B, with different eigenvectors,

00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:21.280
then I don't know what the
eigenvectors of A plus B

00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:22.330
would be.

00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:24.430
I don't know those.

00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:28.040
I can't tell the
eigenvectors of A times B

00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:30.610
because A has its own
little eigenvectors

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:32.420
and B has its eigenvectors.

00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:38.310
Unless they're the same, I
can't easily combine A and B.

00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:47.770
But as always I'm staying with
one A and its powers and steps

00:18:47.770 --> 00:18:50.090
like that, no problem.

00:18:50.090 --> 00:18:50.720
OK.

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:54.240
I'll stop there for a
first look at eigenvalues

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:55.990
and eigenvectors.
