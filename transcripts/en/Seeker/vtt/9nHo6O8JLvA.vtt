00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.569
This episode of DNews is brought to you by
Canon PIXMA Pro professional inkjet printers:

00:00:04.569 --> 00:00:06.549
Exactly as you envisioned.

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:11.330
Each element in the periodic table has special
properties, and sometimes combining them together

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:13.900
gets a good result, but it's hard to do!

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:20.780
What if they could be combined using simple
home office equipment?

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:28.770
I was sent a study this week and looked at
it blankly for an hour before I really got

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:29.770
it.

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:32.560
It was about the plasmonics of metamaterials.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:33.560
Yeah.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.100
Plasmonics is the study of the interaction
between electromagnetic fields and free electrons

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.460
in metals.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.570
Metamaterials are precisely engineered components
which have properties that wouldn't show up

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.469
in nature.

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:49.079
Essentially, it's how the design and engineering
of a thing can affect the behavior of electromagnetic

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.109
energy, like electricity or light.

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:55.980
Metamaterials can be used to create invisibility
cloaks, changing how light interacts with

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.800
a blanket of special elements, or protect
sensitive astronauts in space be changing

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.839
how cosmic radiation is absorbed or reflected.

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:11.030
They even built a black hole analog in a lab
using plasmonic metamaterials.

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.620
The value of the metamaterial was discovered
just after World War II when scientists and

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:20.690
engineers were trying to develop new technologies
to interact with radio, microwave and light

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:21.690
frequencies.

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.860
Today, engineers are working to use metamaterials
affect commercial, military and scientific

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:27.860
applications!

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.970
And thanks to a study in Advanced Optical
Materials, they don't have to use millions

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.520
of dollars of equipment to do it!

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.600
As you might imagine, creating these things
can cost millions of dollars and take months

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.490
with specialized equipment, until recently.

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.840
Carbon is one of the most common elements
on the planet; think, coal, diamonds, humans.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.590
It's really variable, but organized into a
lattice at the molecular level?

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.790
Then you get graphene, a 1-atom thick perfect
electrical capacitor!

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.440
Roll that into tubes and it's super strong!

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.899
Layer it with copper and you get a metamaterial
-- a highly engineered structure that is 500

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.200
times stronger than the pure metal.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.099
The best part, graphene can be printed with
a regular inkjet printer.

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:20.579
Engineers are problem solvers, and the faster
you can solve a problem, the more things you

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:21.579
can fix.

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:26.180
Now, thanks to researchers at the University
of Utah, metamaterials can be created using

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.579
a regular four-color inkjet printer loaded
with carbon and silver "ink."

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:36.090
Using that, researchers were able to build
10 different sample prototypes in a fraction

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.209
of the time of traditional manufacturing,
and the materials could be tested against

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:47.159
terahertz-waves to ensure they block and reflect
them JUST right.

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:50.510
The researchers were pumped that a simple
inkjet printer could create super intricate

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:56.020
plasmonic metamaterials, which makes frickin'
sense.

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.930
Other studies have shown they can print graphene
too.

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.160
Who knew these things would be so useful!?

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.719
These researchers say the ability to create
these prototypes might revolutionize the engineering

00:03:05.719 --> 00:03:10.870
of wireless data transmission, magnetic materials,
the sensing of biological weapons, and even

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.409
spacecraft insulation!

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:17.180
Speaking of inkjet printers, weâ€™d like to
thank Canon for making this episode possible.

and Tara?
