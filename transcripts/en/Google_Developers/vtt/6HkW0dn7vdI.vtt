JENIFER FOULKES: OK.

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:03.195
Welcome, everyone.

00:00:03.195 --> 00:00:06.020
My name is Jenifer Austin
Foulkes, and I manage Google's

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:07.170
Ocean program.

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.130
And I'm here with Richard
Vevers, who's director of the

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:12.685
Catlin Seaview Survey, and
today, we're going to talk

00:00:12.685 --> 00:00:13.935
about Underwater Street View.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.540
To start off, I think it's
helpful to give a little bit

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:22.850
of background on our
Ocean program.

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:26.470
So it started over six years
ago, when Sylvia Earle, who's

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.590
a famous ocean explorer, was
at a conference in Spain

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:30.210
getting an award.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.409
And she went on stage, and in
the audience was one of the

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:34.970
founders of Keyhole, which
became Google Earth.

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:39.340
And she said, John, I love
Google Earth, my grandsons fly

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.510
all around the planet, but you
should really call it Google

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.220
Dirt because you're
missing 3/4 of it.

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.220
And he laughed, and everybody
laughed, and then he had

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.850
Sylvia come and give a
tech talk at Google.

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.750
And that recruited many of us
to come together to work on

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:54.940
how you would add an explorable

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.800
ocean to Google Earth.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.630
And we launched that four years
ago with Jimmy Buffett

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:02.440
and Al Gore.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.850
And since then, we've worked
with many groups, like NOAA,

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.140
Scripps, Navy, [? Jebco ?]
to improve our

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.310
underwater map of the ocean.

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.220
And you can see at the very top
is San Francisco Bay, and

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.430
right off the coast is a canyon
called Monterey Bay

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.610
Canyon, that's deeper than
the Grand Canyon.

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.370
And what we spent the last
several years doing is

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:23.030
improving this map
of the ocean.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.540
And that gives you a sense--
anyone can now hold the ocean

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.190
in your hands, and our products,
and Google Earth for

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.150
Android phones, tablets.

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.080
But what you couldn't do, until
the end of last year, is

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.920
actually see what it looks
like underwater.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.680
And this has been what Richard
and I have been working

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.800
together on, which we're really
excited to talk to you

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.050
about today.

00:01:53.784 --> 00:01:57.220
And I'm going to start off with
just a short video that

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:03.370
we featured at our launch
that introduces.

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:04.864
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:00.820
JENIFER FOULKES: So that's
what we launched at

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.900
the end of last year.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.260
And our goal is, really, to make
all of our Maps products

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.150
more comprehensive with
more ocean data.

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.260
This is the blog post
for our launch.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.430
The turtle was seen
everywhere.

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.900
And our goal was really to take
you from your home in

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.180
Street View and Google Maps
to a turtle's home.

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.090
And I'm going to show
you how it looks in

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.010
our new Maps product.

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.845
Click on the little See Inside,
it takes you into

00:03:30.845 --> 00:03:34.460
Street View, and you can
visit the turtle.

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:39.360
You can go halfway in, halfway
out of the water.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.010
You can visit the Heron
Island Resort.

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.410
You can see where you might like
to be sitting, reading a

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.600
book, testing out your next
vacation, looking out at the

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.060
beautiful Great Barrier Reef.

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.735
Lying underwater and visiting
all the marine

00:03:53.735 --> 00:03:54.985
life that lives there.

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:04.590
So we're really excited
about this.

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.867
We're excited about adding
underwater to

00:04:06.867 --> 00:04:08.730
our Street View product.

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.230
And we've released about
six places so far.

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.770
One in the Philippines, three in
the Great Barrier Reef, and

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:15.780
two in Hawaii.

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.440
And I've actually snorkeled
myself at the Hanauma Bay

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.410
location in Oahu and seen
changes over the last only six

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.380
years that are pretty
dramatic.

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:29.530
And all the more reason why we
need to capture imagery right

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:32.060
now, and bring it to the
rest of the world.

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.740
So as I've heard from many

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.900
scientists, from Sylvia Earle--

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.830
she has seen in her lifetime,
50 years of diving--

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.670
most of the big fish are gone.

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:44.760
Half of coral reefs are gone.

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:45.930
The oceans are warmer.

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:47.110
They're more acidic.

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.550
And coral reef decline
is expected to

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:52.510
continue in our lifetime.

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:56.265
And the chief scientist on
Richard's project, Dr. Ove

00:04:56.265 --> 00:04:58.660
Hoegh-Guldberg from the
University of Queensland,

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.970
published a paper in "Science"
10 years ago showing the

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.740
effects of ocean
acidification.

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.800
So you see a healthy
reef on the left.

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.280
In the middle, the atmospheric
carbon dioxide

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.500
is at a higher level.

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.370
The ocean's become more acidic,
and eventually the

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:17.030
corals die.

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:20.240
And this last figure from his
"Science" article shows, in

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.650
blue, the areas in the world--
this is a world map--

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:26.720
where coral reefs can
actually live.

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:31.530
And as the atmospheric CO2
increases, as noted by the

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:34.130
little white number, the
areas in blue shrink.

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:39.530
So the areas where corals can
live are rapidly declining.

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:43.080
And so it's all the more reason
why we're so excited

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.530
that Richard is using our
products to feature this

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:48.890
beautiful underwater imagery
to really ignite

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:50.200
excitement in the world.

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.650
And with that, I'm going to
turn it over to Richard.

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:53.480
RICHARD VEVERS: Thank
you, Jenifer.

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:59.130
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:01.540
RICHARD VEVERS: There's a very
serious side to this project,

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:05.480
but there's also an amazingly
fun side to the project, as

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.650
you could probably get an idea
from the underwater scooters

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:10.540
that we were driving
in that video.

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:14.360
For me, if you like a challenge,
this is arguably

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.820
the most exciting time to be
in ocean conservation.

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:21.990
What happens here, in the next
10 years, is likely to affect

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:25.500
our oceans for the next
10,000 years.

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:30.190
So it is an immense challenge
that we've got ahead of us.

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:33.360
But really, it's through
technology that we can find

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.150
the solutions.

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:37.500
Now, this is an image
that we took of the

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:38.750
Great Barrier Reef.

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:41.140
It's just one reef on the
Great Barrier Reef.

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:44.860
We took this image about two
months ago, during our major

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:46.550
survey that we were
doing there.

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:50.360
And it just shows the kind of
devastation that is happening.

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:53.590
The Great Barrier Reef has lost
53% of its corals over

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:56.250
the last 30 years alone.

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:59.730
And this kind of information
just isn't publicly out there.

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:01.960
And it's because there haven't
been the communication tools

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:05.910
up until now, really, of
communicating this.

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:10.290
So it's why Street View, and
getting this kind of imagery

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:13.090
out there, is critically
important, as well as getting

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:17.390
the highly engaging content
as you saw in the videos.

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:27.100
Now, we set up our project,
really, to reveal the

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:28.640
reefs of the world.

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:32.550
Now, the biggest single issue
facing our oceans, currently,

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:34.965
is the fact that they're out
of sight, and out of mind.

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:40.670
Really, the issue is
that people can't--

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:44.670
well, don't want to protect
anything that they can't see.

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:47.920
And it's vital that we reveal
the oceans to the world, which

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:50.150
is why we set up our
not-for-profit organization

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:52.640
about three years ago.

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:57.320
99.9% of people on the planet do
not dive, and they probably

00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:58.980
never will.

00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:00.595
But there's no reason
why we can't take

00:08:00.595 --> 00:08:03.360
them virtual diving.

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:05.320
And this is really why we
set up the organization.

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:11.550
There's no excuse, anymore,
for not having the oceans

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:15.270
accessible to everyone
with internet access.

00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:18.740
If Google can do this in the
terrestrial environment, we

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:21.040
thought there's absolutely no
reason why we shouldn't be

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:23.020
doing this underwater.

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:26.590
So we went about designing a
camera that could do this.

00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:29.450
Now, the cameras for underwater
work very

00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:33.390
differently from
cameras above.

00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:36.250
We couldn't use just the
existing Street View camera

00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:37.909
and take that underwater.

00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:42.320
We had to use much, much
wider-angle lenses to work in

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:44.940
low-visibility conditions.

00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:47.710
Obviously, we had to replace
the car with an underwater

00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:52.220
scooter, but we still
got the same driver.

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:55.460
The way we've worked the camera
is-- you've got three

00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:59.340
cameras at the front, which are
all firing simultaneously.

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:01.630
And as we travel along, we
take a shot every three

00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:06.630
seconds at about 2 meters
above the ocean floor.

00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:09.510
Now, when you're on expedition,
you're going to

00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:10.440
have flooded cameras.

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:13.690
So we wanted to design a camera
that could work, that

00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:16.820
we didn't have to open while
we're on expedition because

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:19.180
that's when you're going
to have the problems.

00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:22.250
So we actually worked with a
system where we've got an

00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:25.250
underwater tablet, which you
can see just to the back of

00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:27.820
the scooter there, that
operates the cameras.

00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:30.950
It controls the ISOs, and the
speed, so we can make

00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:34.520
adjustments as we're motoring
along the reef.

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:38.590
Now, typically on a dive we'll
cover 2 kilometers and we'll

00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:41.620
take 3,000 images, which
are then stitched to

00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:44.260
create 1,000 panoramas.

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.370
And these can all be uploaded.

00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:48.260
At the moment, we've been
focusing on the most engaging

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:51.850
content, but it really is a case
of trying to reveal as

00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:53.100
much as we possibly can.

00:09:57.920 --> 00:09:59.620
Now, this just gives you
an indication of

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:00.470
three of the shots.

00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:03.830
We've got two pointing slightly
up, to the left and

00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:06.820
to the right, and one pointing
directly down.

00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:09.440
Now, the reason why we went
for this configuration is

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:13.470
because to monitor reefs, you
need that downward-facing

00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:15.750
image because that's the one
that has been traditionally

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:19.980
used in the past, a
downward-facing shot of reefs

00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:21.910
and other ocean environments.

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:24.940
So we set up the configuration
in this format, and then

00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:27.560
pointed the camera
slightly forward.

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:28.900
So we've got a black
spot behind

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:30.480
where the diver's hidden.

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:34.010
And we have to stitch that
for the end result.

00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:38.560
Now, the end result is to
create this-- this is an

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:40.210
equi-rectangular image.

00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:47.300
But when you search for
panoramic images underwater,

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:52.360
on the internet, there are
very, very few out there.

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:56.250
And especially a
full 360 image.

00:10:56.250 --> 00:10:59.300
This suddenly communicates, in
a way that's never been done

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:03.080
before, exactly what that
environment is.

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:05.950
A scientist, or anybody, can
look at that environment and

00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:10.270
see what the structure's like,
how healthy it is.

00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:13.440
But more importantly, we can
also look at it and monitor it

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:14.690
for change.

00:11:18.572 --> 00:11:21.170
Now, Jenifer is going to talk
through some of the

00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:23.240
challenges we had.

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:25.940
Once we'd collected this
imagery, it was then a case of

00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:28.200
trying to get it into
Street View.

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:32.000
And there's an amazing tool that
allowed us to do this.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:32.390
JENIFER FOULKES: Yes.

00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:33.740
So, thanks, Richard.

00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:36.030
So we basically had worked with
Richard to help him use

00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:39.620
our Business Photos tool
to upload his imagery.

00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:43.130
And so anyone who joins our
Business Photography program,

00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:46.050
you can upload your own
panoramic imagery, as this

00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:49.980
garden center in New
York has done.

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:53.910
I think once you have that
panoramic imagery in Street

00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:56.970
View, you can then use the
Street View API to embed that

00:11:56.970 --> 00:11:58.660
content on your own website.

00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:00.820
And you can see we've done
that here with our Maps

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:04.520
gallery at
maps.google.com/ocean.

00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:07.440
Here's some of the code from
our developers' site that

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:09.000
shows you how you can do this.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.580
And another partner of
Richard's, TerraMar Project,

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:15.380
which is another non-profit,
has embedded Richard's

00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:18.200
beautiful imagery in a sort of
gallery context using the

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:20.270
Street View API on their
own website,

00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:21.680
for educational purposes.

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:25.130
For students and teachers to go
there and get quick access

00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:26.380
to that imagery.

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:32.500
RICHARD VEVERS: Now, the Catlin
Seaview Survey isn't

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:36.610
really just about revealing
the oceans to the world,

00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:38.260
especially coral reefs.

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.970
But I mean, that's half
of the story.

00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:45.550
The rest of the story is about
creating a scientific baseline

00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:47.760
with which to monitor change.

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:51.200
Now, it was when we initially
showed the first images that

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:54.210
we were capturing to one of the
world's leading coral reef

00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:55.240
scientists.

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:59.230
He saw the potential
of this imagery.

00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:03.210
Because traditionally, they've
been sending a diver down and

00:13:03.210 --> 00:13:08.440
doing a 50-meter dive, taking
photographs of the sea floor.

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:11.240
And that was the way of
monitoring these environments.

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:14.600
Suddenly, we have a tool for
doing 2 kilometers at a time,

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:17.800
and capturing the full
360 environment.

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:21.510
And it allowed you to see
exactly what was going on in

00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:24.450
that entire environment.

00:13:24.450 --> 00:13:29.020
So we set about establishing a
strict scientific protocol for

00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:31.160
all our data capture.

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:33.520
And that's what we have been
doing over the last five

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:35.170
months on the Great Barrier
Reef, visiting

00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:36.870
32 different reefs.

00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:39.790
And now we've expanded the
project over to pilots in the

00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:42.690
Caribbean and other areas.

00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:45.750
Now, all these images are
going to be made freely

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:49.390
available for scientists to
analyze, and we'll come along

00:13:49.390 --> 00:13:53.620
on to some of the analysis
in a minute.

00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:57.510
And we're launching the Catlin
Global Reef Record later on

00:13:57.510 --> 00:14:01.350
this year, which will have all
of the images, and not just

00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:04.940
the most engaging images,
available for scientists to

00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:07.890
study, as well as the public
to monitor the change.

00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:15.350
Now, image analysis is critical
to this project.

00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:19.540
We currently have in the region
of 150,000 images that

00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:22.220
we've taken over the last five
months, and this figure is

00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:26.080
going to grow exponentially
as we expand the project.

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:27.730
Now, this is just a section
of one of the

00:14:27.730 --> 00:14:29.830
downward-facing images.

00:14:29.830 --> 00:14:35.710
But Scripps, over here in the
US, has developed some amazing

00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:38.800
image recognition technology
that will allow us to identify

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:41.840
species of corals on reefs.

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:45.460
And the data that we collected
from the Great Barrier Reef is

00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:48.740
currently being processed
as we speak.

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:51.080
But currently, this is
restricted to the

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:52.610
downward-facing camera.

00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:56.780
We currently have no way
of auto-analyzing

00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:58.300
the rest of the 360.

00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:02.600
And that's something we
desperately need to develop so

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:03.850
we can get the full picture.

00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:10.510
We're also working, just back
on the science, on the 3D

00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:11.400
modelling of the reef.

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:14.550
We've got stereo cameras which
are adding an extra layer of

00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:17.580
data that hopefully, when we
can combine with satellite

00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:21.500
data, will provide us with
hugely powerful planning tools

00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:23.840
for global reefs.

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:28.080
Now, as I said, this project
is 50% science and 50%

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:29.330
communication and engagement.

00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:35.980
And really, that's what sets
this project apart from most

00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:40.560
projects, is this focus on the
community and the engagement.

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:44.030
There's really very little point
in doing science if it's

00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:47.040
only getting out to a few
hundred people, especially not

00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:50.530
to the public, and not
to the policymakers.

00:15:50.530 --> 00:15:53.190
And this is where the
collaboration with Google is

00:15:53.190 --> 00:15:56.670
absolutely vital to this project
because, instead of

00:15:56.670 --> 00:15:59.735
these images being seen by a few
hundreds or even thousands

00:15:59.735 --> 00:16:03.060
of people, we're getting
out to tens, or even

00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:04.940
hundreds, of millions.

00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:06.770
Now we've got over
3 million people

00:16:06.770 --> 00:16:08.646
following us on Google+.

00:16:08.646 --> 00:16:11.870
We do our regular
photo spheres.

00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:15.220
We've got some daily updates
from the field.

00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:19.490
We've literally just come off
an expedition at the moment.

00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:22.040
And we do these daily updates
while we're out there, and

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:26.080
it's a hugely powerful tool,
especially when you use some

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:29.340
of the other features
of Google+.

00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:34.090
We've been doing a lot of fun,
if slightly stressful,

00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:39.970
underwater Hangouts, patching
in live to conferences from

00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:41.060
underwater.

00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:44.130
And the one on the left-hand
side was one we did--

00:16:44.130 --> 00:16:47.950
it was over at our Monterey
launch, which unfortunately

00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:50.770
was middle of the night for us
on the Great Barrier Reef.

00:16:50.770 --> 00:16:54.510
But fortunately, a turtle turned
up halfway through the

00:16:54.510 --> 00:16:57.310
show, which made for
added interest.

00:16:57.310 --> 00:17:01.220
But again, this is an incredible
tool that we

00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:05.010
haven't even scratched the
surface of the potential.

00:17:05.010 --> 00:17:07.220
If we can get this out to
schools, for example, and

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:11.000
engage schoolchildren all over
the world with people that are

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.460
scientists underwater carrying
out the surveys, it's just an

00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:16.710
amazing tool.

00:17:18.609 --> 00:17:20.480
Also, the immersive
photo spheres--

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:24.000
I don't know whether you want to
show one, probably that we

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.730
loaded yesterday--

00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:29.150
is a great way of just having
hero images that can really

00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:31.930
capture an environment,
a whole area,

00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:33.570
just in a single image.

00:17:33.570 --> 00:17:35.500
This is one that we took--

00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:39.660
I don't know whether I can
scroll around-- of a wreck in

00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:42.680
Aruba, about three weeks ago.

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:45.020
But you're starting
to get the idea.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.640
And some of our divers
on the survey.

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:55.260
And we'll be posting a lot more
of these photo spheres.

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:56.910
And Jenifer is going to
talk a little bit

00:17:56.910 --> 00:17:58.160
more about photo spheres.

00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:11.350
JENIFER FOULKES: So my colleague
Evan has been

00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:16.630
driving the creation of this
ability to take 360s from the

00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:18.230
Android phone.

00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:23.230
And when you take a 360, you can
actually then upload, and

00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:25.470
share that, to Google Maps.

00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:28.460
And I'm particularly excited
because I just discovered that

00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:32.510
there's actually an underwater
case for the Nexus 4, and I

00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:36.330
will be diving in a couple
weeks in Bali to do some

00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:39.170
testing of collecting my own
underwater photo spheres.

00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:40.410
So I'm very excited
about that.

00:18:40.410 --> 00:18:43.530
And after you upload them to
Maps, then you can also share

00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:47.960
them on your own website and
embed them for whatever travel

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:50.970
or communication interest
you have.

00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:52.590
RICHARD VEVERS: Yes, we have
been cheating slightly with

00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:55.730
photo spheres at the moment,
using our SV2 camera, rather

00:18:55.730 --> 00:18:57.850
than the Android, but we will
be taking a lot more Android

00:18:57.850 --> 00:19:01.010
ones coming up soon.

00:19:01.010 --> 00:19:02.930
Now, as we said, there's
very much a serious

00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:04.830
side to this project.

00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:07.170
Over the next three years,
we're planning to try and

00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:12.450
capture a baseline for the
coral reefs of the world.

00:19:12.450 --> 00:19:15.220
So we are focusing on the
Americas this year.

00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:18.400
Then we're off to Asia, and the
Coral Triangle, which is

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:21.430
really the epicenter of
coral reefs worldwide.

00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:23.880
And then we're off to the
Indian Ocean, right

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:24.740
up to the Red Sea.

00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:27.750
So hopefully within the next
three years you'll be able to

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:31.680
go diving virtually anywhere
in the world.

00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:36.200
Now, the decline is so rapid,
of coral reefs, that we feel

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:39.020
this is very much a
race against time.

00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:42.290
And we want to go out there to
record and reveal coral reefs,

00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:44.750
so that the change
can be monitored.

00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:47.280
And we can look for areas of
resilience and work out what

00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:49.310
are the critical areas
to protect.

00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:51.195
And that is what this project
is all about.

00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:58.250
Now, we need more developers.

00:19:58.250 --> 00:20:01.680
We've had some amazing support
from the developers that have

00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:06.570
been involved in the project,
from developing the apps to

00:20:06.570 --> 00:20:10.910
control the cameras to really
looking at the technology for

00:20:10.910 --> 00:20:13.820
the image recognition
to so many different

00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:15.670
aspects of this project--

00:20:15.670 --> 00:20:18.990
the stitching technology,
et cetera.

00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:22.760
Technology very much is
the solution here.

00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:26.010
It's the only way that we can
communicate to enough people

00:20:26.010 --> 00:20:29.010
around the planet about what is
going on and carry out the

00:20:29.010 --> 00:20:31.090
science that's required in
the required time frame.

00:20:34.810 --> 00:20:39.540
There are three specific
areas that we need

00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:41.440
to be focusing on.

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:45.340
The first of these areas is
engaging as many people on the

00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:49.420
planet to help us in the
gathering of the data.

00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:52.020
Now, we've got our SV2 cameras,
which are going to be

00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:56.020
limited to the number of sites
that we can cover.

00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:59.180
Now, if it was possible to
engage the 10 million divers

00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:02.770
around the planet, using their
existing technology with

00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:06.880
simple housings to create
baselines of their own, or go

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:11.310
back and visit our baselines and
monitor change, and notify

00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:14.820
us of that change, we would have
a hugely powerful tool.

00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:17.880
And this is something that we
very much want to focus on

00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:21.460
over the next 12 months.

00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:27.280
The second area is one that
I mentioned earlier.

00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:29.440
And that is the image
recognition.

00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:32.850
Once we've collected the data,
we need to be able to analyze

00:21:32.850 --> 00:21:35.650
it, and analyze it quickly.

00:21:35.650 --> 00:21:40.960
With potentially millions of
images, we need to develop the

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:44.070
software to look at the
full 360 and find

00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:45.415
ways of doing that.

00:21:45.415 --> 00:21:48.860
Now, this can be through just
development of the image

00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:53.700
recognition, or we can engage
citizen scientists.

00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:56.370
Now, because of the number of
people that we can talk to

00:21:56.370 --> 00:21:59.100
through this project, thanks
to the collaboration with

00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:04.010
Google, if we can collectively
bring the citizen scientists

00:22:04.010 --> 00:22:10.100
together to start analyzing
these images and develop ways

00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:13.280
of educating the computers
through that analysis, again,

00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:15.830
that will be a hugely
powerful tool.

00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:19.090
And a great way of engaging
people globally.

00:22:19.090 --> 00:22:24.580
The third area is very much on
the engagement side of things.

00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:28.590
How do we use this imagery in
the best possible way to

00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:29.490
engage people?

00:22:29.490 --> 00:22:34.080
Whether it's virtual experiences
in exhibitions,

00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:37.380
it's headsets, it's just
any way of engaging.

00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:40.530
We have amazing, engaging
content, but we need to

00:22:40.530 --> 00:22:43.100
communicate it to as many people
around the planet as we

00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:45.000
possibly can.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.640
And that's what we're looking
for help for.

00:22:49.770 --> 00:22:52.040
What we need, really,
is the developers.

00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:54.760
And it's really developers and
the technology that are going

00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:58.150
to provide the solutions
to this.

00:22:58.150 --> 00:23:00.140
If you are interested in
getting involved in the

00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:03.230
project, I'll be at the stand
where we've got the camera on

00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:07.090
display at the Google
Maps area.

00:23:07.090 --> 00:23:10.680
Or you can contact us through
the Google+ page, at Catlin

00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:11.870
Seaview Survey.

00:23:11.870 --> 00:23:13.770
Or also just contact
us through the

00:23:13.770 --> 00:23:15.020
catlinseaviewsurvey.com.

00:23:16.628 --> 00:23:18.141
Thank you very much.

00:23:18.141 --> 00:23:26.980
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:30.470
JENIFER FOULKES: And I'd just
like to also conclude that

00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:32.800
this project wouldn't have
been possible without my

00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:35.050
colleague Steve Silverman at
Google, who has helped me

00:23:35.050 --> 00:23:35.585
manage this.

00:23:35.585 --> 00:23:37.850
So thanks to Steve.

00:23:37.850 --> 00:23:40.910
Yeah, so if there are any
questions about this project,

00:23:40.910 --> 00:23:43.250
use the mic, or raise your
hand, and I'll repeat it.

00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:53.610
AUDIENCE: Hi, my
name is Daniel.

00:23:53.610 --> 00:23:55.160
I have a couple different
questions.

00:23:55.160 --> 00:24:00.650
One is, you said it takes a shot
every three seconds and

00:24:00.650 --> 00:24:02.340
you do 2 kilometers on a run.

00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:04.730
What would limit you
to 2 kilometers?

00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:07.282
That's only about six
minutes, right?

00:24:07.282 --> 00:24:07.800
RICHARD VEVERS: Sorry.

00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:09.560
No, we're actually--

00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:11.780
because it's an underwater
environment, you're going

00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:12.740
along very slowly.

00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:13.540
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:17.270
RICHARD VEVERS: So typically,
we'll cover 2 kilometers in

00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:20.650
about 40 to 45 minutes.

00:24:20.650 --> 00:24:23.740
We restrict that because of
the battery life of the

00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:26.140
underwater scooter, and
also just keeping

00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:28.490
within safety protocols.

00:24:28.490 --> 00:24:31.980
The idea is if we could develop
the AUV version, in

00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:36.120
the same way that we've got cars
that don't need drivers,

00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:40.530
we can go off for a 12-hour run,
and get a lot more data.

00:24:40.530 --> 00:24:43.050
So that's, again, something
the we're working on.

00:24:43.050 --> 00:24:45.180
AUDIENCE: How many cameras
do you have?

00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:47.540
RICHARD VEVERS: Four,
of which two have

00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:48.540
never been in the water.

00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:50.370
One of them's on the stand.

00:24:50.370 --> 00:24:52.770
So it is a very young project.

00:24:52.770 --> 00:24:56.230
We only launched it back in
September last year, and we're

00:24:56.230 --> 00:24:58.710
developing it as fast
as we possibly can.

00:24:58.710 --> 00:25:00.490
AUDIENCE: Do you have plans
to get more cameras?

00:25:00.490 --> 00:25:02.020
Or is it a financial, or--

00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:03.160
RICHARD VEVERS: It's
a financial

00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:04.300
restriction, at the moment.

00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:06.150
The more cameras
that we have--

00:25:06.150 --> 00:25:08.080
the idea is to be able
to bring third-party

00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:12.320
organizations, so people like
NOAA, and other organizations

00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:16.060
who have skilled divers, that
can carry out the data

00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:19.340
collection for us if we can
provide them with the tools.

00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:23.090
So yes, if there was a way of
getting more cameras, yes, we

00:25:23.090 --> 00:25:24.310
would be wanting it.

00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:26.700
AUDIENCE: How much
is a camera?

00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:28.370
RICHARD VEVERS: The cameras--

00:25:28.370 --> 00:25:32.280
it's around the $50,000
a piece mark.

00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:32.746
AUDIENCE: US?

00:25:32.746 --> 00:25:33.680
RICHARD VEVERS: US.

00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:35.480
AUDIENCE: One question
to the Google side.

00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:38.880
Is there any business
case in it?

00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:43.070
JENIFER FOULKES: I think our
motivation in this has been

00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:45.240
making our maps more
comprehensive.

00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:49.800
And I think as you may have seen
in the keynote, there are

00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:51.060
a lot of references to it.

00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:55.650
I think it's very powerful and
excites the imagination about

00:25:55.650 --> 00:25:56.940
what could be possible.

00:25:56.940 --> 00:26:01.530
So I think, from my motivation,
it's been very

00:26:01.530 --> 00:26:02.710
inspired by Sylvia.

00:26:02.710 --> 00:26:03.935
With knowing, comes caring.

00:26:03.935 --> 00:26:06.080
With caring, there's hope.

00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:08.950
AUDIENCE: So there are no ads
placed, or something.

00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:09.580
JENIFER FOULKES: Right now--

00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:13.790
I mean, I don't have a crystal
ball, but no, that's not my

00:26:13.790 --> 00:26:16.320
current plans with it.

00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:18.220
AUDIENCE: Hi, my
name is David.

00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:21.745
Do you capture other data like
temperature, and acidity, or

00:26:21.745 --> 00:26:24.460
do you correlate with
satellite data?

00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:26.050
RICHARD VEVERS: Yes, a lot of
the data that we're capturing

00:26:26.050 --> 00:26:27.920
is related to the image data.

00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:30.110
So depth loggers, et cetera.

00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:31.160
Tilts and that.

00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:33.710
But we're also doing
temperature.

00:26:33.710 --> 00:26:36.980
We're collecting less of the
other data at the moment

00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:39.000
because we're not in
environments long enough for

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.640
that data to be useful.

00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:44.850
We're looking to leave long term
monitoring data in sites

00:26:44.850 --> 00:26:49.180
to create sites that we go back
and revisit over time.

00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:51.025
But that's something that we
need to add to the project.

00:26:54.148 --> 00:26:55.070
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:26:55.070 --> 00:26:58.080
You mentioned earlier that
you're thinking about doing an

00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:00.440
autonomous camera?

00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:01.450
Is that about right,
what you said?

00:27:01.450 --> 00:27:02.530
RICHARD VEVERS: Yes.

00:27:02.530 --> 00:27:06.420
AUDIENCE: How do you plan on
getting over the problems with

00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:11.820
GPS signals and just other RF
frequencies underwater?

00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:14.950
RICHARD VEVERS: To be honest,
I'm probably not the person to

00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:15.770
ask about that.

00:27:15.770 --> 00:27:18.100
But we've been working with the
University of Sydney, who

00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:21.320
has developed an AUV that is
capable of hugging the

00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:25.770
substrate 2 meters above the
substrate, and it will go for

00:27:25.770 --> 00:27:27.480
12 hours at a time.

00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:30.280
That's the kind of vehicle that
is perfect for this kind

00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:31.390
of surveying.

00:27:31.390 --> 00:27:34.720
And they've managed to work
out a very accurate way of

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:37.680
getting the GPS locations
because it's currently being

00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:40.440
used for just that
single downward

00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:42.340
monitoring of the substrate.

00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:44.120
We're on full 360.

00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:47.610
So we know the technology is
there, it's just a case of

00:27:47.610 --> 00:27:49.845
getting it to work with our
current camera technology.

00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:54.160
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:56.550
I work in a science museum, the
Lawrence Hall of Science

00:27:56.550 --> 00:27:57.610
at Berkeley.

00:27:57.610 --> 00:28:02.190
And this is more of a question
for Google because the project

00:28:02.190 --> 00:28:06.610
I'm working on is stereoscopic
3D visualizations of lake

00:28:06.610 --> 00:28:07.970
ecosystems.

00:28:07.970 --> 00:28:11.210
So are there any plans of doing
a Street View-- and the

00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:13.860
lake that we're doing
is Lake Tahoe.

00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:19.330
So it's to empower people to
look at the dynamic and nature

00:28:19.330 --> 00:28:22.140
of our freshwater ecosystems.

00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:26.370
And I can actually see a
business case for doing a Lake

00:28:26.370 --> 00:28:31.055
Tahoe underwater Street View.

00:28:31.055 --> 00:28:34.070
Have you guys considered
freshwater ecosystems?

00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:36.012
Because you're sea, but--

00:28:36.012 --> 00:28:37.370
RICHARD VEVERS: Yeah.

00:28:37.370 --> 00:28:38.180
JENIFER FOULKES: Yeah.

00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:42.015
So primarily, we've been in the
beginning of this project,

00:28:42.015 --> 00:28:44.690
so we've primarily been working
with Richard and the

00:28:44.690 --> 00:28:45.460
Catlin Seaview.

00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:48.730
But I would imagine, in the
future, as they get more

00:28:48.730 --> 00:28:51.960
cameras, they could potentially
loan one to

00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:56.960
somebody who wanted to do those
sorts of lake collects.

00:28:56.960 --> 00:29:01.220
And there should be no problem
featuring it in that Business

00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:04.610
Photos tool, just as they've
featured their imagery.

00:29:04.610 --> 00:29:07.390
So in theory, it's
possible today.

00:29:07.390 --> 00:29:07.520
AUDIENCE: Wonderful.

00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:07.860
Thank you.

00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:09.970
RICHARD VEVERS: Yes, we've
already started testing in

00:29:09.970 --> 00:29:12.170
other environments.

00:29:12.170 --> 00:29:17.590
Right down from Sydney Harbor,
through to mangrove areas.

00:29:17.590 --> 00:29:20.630
A lot of the restrictions are
down to visibility, and making

00:29:20.630 --> 00:29:22.840
sure you're getting the best
possible visibility.

00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:25.810
But we're also looking at other
low-light cameras that

00:29:25.810 --> 00:29:29.420
will really maximize the imagery
that we get back, so

00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:33.950
it's of scientific use and also
it's highly engaging.

00:29:33.950 --> 00:29:37.120
Because we need to be highly
engaging for it to get the

00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:39.450
right messages out.

00:29:39.450 --> 00:29:40.920
AUDIENCE: That's one reason why
I picked Tahoe, because

00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:42.170
it's so blue.

00:29:46.190 --> 00:29:48.480
AUDIENCE: Hi, I was wondering
how accurate your GPS

00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:49.660
information is.

00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:54.390
And if you're able to tie the
locations of the images to

00:29:54.390 --> 00:30:01.340
navigational map datum that
are more from a vessel

00:30:01.340 --> 00:30:03.380
navigation standpoint.

00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:03.720
RICHARD VEVERS: Yes.

00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:06.740
I mean, currently we've been
using the standard scientific

00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:08.690
protocol, which is trailing,
because we're

00:30:08.690 --> 00:30:10.030
in 8 meters of water.

00:30:10.030 --> 00:30:10.740
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:12.510
RICHARD VEVERS: We can
trail a buoy behind

00:30:12.510 --> 00:30:14.960
us at a fixed distance.

00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:17.780
So that's how we're gathering
all of the data currently, and

00:30:17.780 --> 00:30:20.530
obviously we can match that up
with other data sources.

00:30:20.530 --> 00:30:20.960
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:23.540
Thanks.

00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:26.330
AUDIENCE: My question is mostly
with the specification

00:30:26.330 --> 00:30:27.340
of your vehicle.

00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:29.610
Like how long is the
battery life?

00:30:29.610 --> 00:30:30.515
And how much is the storage?

00:30:30.515 --> 00:30:34.420
And how often do you have
to replace the storage?

00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:36.580
And get a new--

00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:39.930
RICHARD VEVERS: A typical day
for us is we'll set out very

00:30:39.930 --> 00:30:42.140
early on in the morning,
and we'll plan to do

00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:43.740
three dives in a day.

00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:47.490
You do two dives back-to-back
from a boat, and we change the

00:30:47.490 --> 00:30:51.800
batteries of the scooters
over after each dive.

00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:55.640
But the rest of the batteries
in the cameras, for example,

00:30:55.640 --> 00:31:01.360
the orb unscrews off, and we
charge that up overnight,

00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:04.620
download the data, clear the
cards, and then we're ready to

00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:05.530
go the following morning.

00:31:05.530 --> 00:31:08.470
And that will do us the
full three dives.

00:31:08.470 --> 00:31:10.990
AUDIENCE: So each dive
is like 30 minutes?

00:31:10.990 --> 00:31:13.790
RICHARD VEVERS: Each dive is
normally an hour by the time

00:31:13.790 --> 00:31:17.580
we get down, carry out the
transact, and then get up to

00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:18.810
the surface again.

00:31:18.810 --> 00:31:23.920
AUDIENCE: So in each cycle, how
much data do you collect?

00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:27.340
RICHARD VEVERS: Well, it will
be normally about 3,000 to

00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:29.750
4,000 images per camera.

00:31:29.750 --> 00:31:31.100
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:31.550
All right.

00:31:31.550 --> 00:31:32.800
Thanks.

00:31:34.844 --> 00:31:35.625
JENIFER FOULKES: Great.

00:31:35.625 --> 00:31:37.420
Thank you.

00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:38.920
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:39.520
RICHARD VEVERS: Thank you.

00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:43.943
[APPLAUSE]
