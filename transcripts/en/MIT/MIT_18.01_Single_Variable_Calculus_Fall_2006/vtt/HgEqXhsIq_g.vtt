00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:28.900
PROFESSOR: Today we're going to
continue our discussion of

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.040
methods of integration.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.550
The method that I'm going to
describe today handles a whole

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.510
class of functions of
the following form.

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.870
You take P (x) / Q (x)
and this is known

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:53.460
as a rational function.

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:01.090
And all that means is that
it's a ratio off two

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:13.300
polynomials, which are these
functions P ( x) and Q ( x).

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.560
We'll handle all such functions
by a method which is

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:26.250
known as partial fractions.

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:36.300
And what this does is, it splits
P / Q into what you

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:45.260
could call easier pieces.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.030
So that's going to be some
kind of algebra.

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.380
And that's what we're going
to spend most of

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.640
our time doing today.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.090
I'll start with an example.

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.950
And all of my examples
will be illustrating

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.830
more general methods.

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:08.200
The example is to integrate the
function 1 / x - 1 +, say,

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:15.240
3 / x + 2 dx.

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.400
That's easy to do.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.410
It's just, we already
know the answer.

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:26.780
It's ln x - 1 + 3 ln x + 3.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.340
Plus a constant.

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:37.050
So that's done.

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.330
So now, here's the difficulty
that is going to arise.

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.070
The difficulty is that I can
start with this function,

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:49.210
which is perfectly manageable.

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:52.830
And than I can add these
two functions together.

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.380
The way I add fractions.

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.750
So that's getting a common
denominator.

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.645
And so that gives me x +
2 here + 3 ( x - 1).

00:03:06.645 --> 00:03:11.550
And now if I combine together
all of these terms, then

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:16.960
altogether I have 4x +
2 - 3, that's - 1.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:23.690
And if I multiply out the
denominator that's x ^2 + that

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:28.060
2 turned into a 3, that's
interesting.

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.240
Hope there aren't too many more
of those transformations.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.570
Is there another one here?

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:36.830
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:39.150
PROFESSOR: Oh, it happened
earlier on.

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.620
Wow that's an interesting
vibration there.

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.510
OK.

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:50.500
Thank you.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:56.770
So, I guess my 3's were
speaking to my 2's.

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.610
Somewhere in my past.
OK, anyway, I

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:07.200
think this is now correct.

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.020
So the problem is
the following.

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:11.450
This is the problem with this.

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.830
This integral was easy.

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:18.500
I'm calling it easy, we already
know how to do it.

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:19.450
Over here.

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:28.040
But now over here,
it's disguised.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:32.270
It's the same function, but it's
no longer clear how to

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.780
integrate it.

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.990
If you're faced with this
one, you say what am

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.480
I supposed to do.

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.790
And we have to get around
that difficulty.

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:44.205
And so what we're going
to do is we're going

00:04:44.205 --> 00:04:46.660
to unwind this disguise.

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:57.950
So we have the algebra problem
that we have. Oh, wow.

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:59.510
There must be something
in the water.

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:06.280
Impressive.

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:06.920
Wow.

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:08.350
OK, let's see.

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:14.660
Is 2/3 = 3/2?

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:17.960
Holy cow.

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:18.760
Well that's good.

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.340
Well, I'll keep you awake
today with several other

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:23.940
transpositions here.

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:30.760
So our algebra problem is to
detect the easy pieces which

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:36.290
are inside.

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:38.850
And the method that we're going
to use, the one that

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:43.880
we'll emphasize anyway, is one
algebraic trick which is a

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:49.320
shortcut, which is called
the cover-up method.

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.170
But we're going to talk
about even more

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:52.510
general things than that.

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:54.300
But anyway, this is where
we're headed.

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.910
Is something called the
cover-up method.

00:05:57.910 --> 00:05:59.490
Alright.

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:02.640
So that's our intro.

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:05.765
And I'll just have to remember
that 2 is not 3.

00:06:05.765 --> 00:06:08.130
I'll keep on repeating that.

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:12.240
So now here I'm going to
describe to you how we unwind

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:13.880
this disguise.

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:16.990
The first step is,
we write down the

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:18.690
function we want to integrate.

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:21.890
Which was this.

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:26.310
And now we have to undo the
first damage that we did.

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:31.930
So the first step is to factor
the denominator.

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:34.580
And that factors, we happen to
know the factors, so I'm not

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:36.150
going to carry this out.

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:38.510
But this can be a rather
difficult step.

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:41.110
But we're going to assume
that it's done.

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:44.030
For the purposes of
illustration here.

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:46.780
So I factor the denominator.

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:51.730
And now, the second thing that
I'm going to do is what I'm

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:54.770
going to call the setup here.

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:56.520
How I'm going to
set things up.

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:00.100
And I'll tell you what these
things are more systematically

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:01.010
in a second.

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:03.210
And the setup is that
I want to somehow

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:05.240
detect what I did before.

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:11.880
And I'm going to write
some unknowns here.

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:15.650
What I expect is that this will
break up into two pieces.

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:18.060
One with the denominator x -
1, and the other with the

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:23.470
denominator x + 2.

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:32.860
So now, my third step is going
to be to solve for A and B.

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:34.500
And then I'm done,
if I do that.

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:41.370
That's the complete unwinding
of this disguise.

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:43.940
And this is where the cover-up
method comes in handy.

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:46.800
This is this method that
I'm about to describe.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:49.920
Now, you can do the algebra in a
clumsy way, or you can do it

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:50.970
in a quick way.

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:54.240
And we'd like to get efficient
about the algebra involved.

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:57.450
And so let me show you
what the first step

00:07:57.450 --> 00:07:58.590
in the trick is.

00:07:58.590 --> 00:08:12.470
We're going to solve for A by
multiplying by (x - 1).

00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:16.080
Now, notice if you multiply by
(x - 1) in that equation 2,

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:16.920
what you get is this.

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:21.840
You got 4x - 2 / the
x - 1's cancel.

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:23.920
You get this on the
left-hand side.

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:27.870
And on the right-hand side
you get A. The x

00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:29.620
- 1's cancel again.

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:31.420
And then we get this
extra term.

00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:35.200
Which is B/ ( x + 2)( x - 1).

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:39.200
Now, the trick here, and we're
going to get even better trick

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:40.370
in just a second.

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:42.970
The trick here is that I
didn't try to clear the

00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:44.560
denominators completely.

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:46.820
I was very efficient about
the way I did it.

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:51.390
It just cleared one factor.

00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:54.780
And the result here
is very useful.

00:08:54.780 --> 00:09:03.480
Namely, if I plug in now x =
1, this term drops out too.

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:10.560
So what I'm going to do now is
I'm going to plug in x = 1.

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:13.970
And what I get on the left-hand
side here is 4 - 1

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:16.550
and 1 + 2, and on the
left-hand side I get

00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:19.740
A. That's the end.

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:27.150
This is my formula for A. A
happens to be equal to 1.

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:29.100
And that's, of course,
what I expect.

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:33.340
A had better be 1, because the
thing broke up into 1 / x - 1

00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:37.100
+ 3 / x + 2.

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:39.900
So this is the correct answer.

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:41.610
There was a question out
here, which I missed.

00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:48.560
STUDENT: Aren't polynomials
defined as functions with

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:56.210
whole powers, or could
they be square roots?

00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:58.300
PROFESSOR: Are polynomials
defined as functions with

00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:00.330
whole powers, or can they
be square roots?

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:01.350
That's the question.

00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:04.140
The answer is, they only
have whole powers.

00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:06.950
So for instance here I only
have the power 1 and 0.

00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:10.410
Here I have the powers 2, 1
and 0 in the denominator.

00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:16.890
Square roots are no good
for this method.

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:17.670
Another question.

00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:18.620
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:22.260
PROFESSOR: Why did
I say x = 1?

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:26.650
The reason why I said x = 1 was
that it works really fast.

00:10:26.650 --> 00:10:27.910
You can't know this in advance,

00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:30.400
that's part of the method.

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:32.810
It just turns out to be
the best thing to do.

00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:36.360
The fastest way of getting at
the coefficient A. Now the

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:38.210
curious thing, let me
just pause for a

00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:39.320
second before I do it.

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:44.010
If I had plugged x = 1 into the
original equation, I would

00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:45.070
have gotten nonsense.

00:10:45.070 --> 00:10:48.210
Because I would've gotten
0 in the denominator.

00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:50.940
And that seems like the most
horrible thing to do.

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:54.280
The worst possible thing
to do, is to set x = 1.

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:56.490
On the other hand, what
we did is a trick.

00:10:56.490 --> 00:10:58.870
We multiplied by x - 1.

00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:01.100
And that turned the equation
into this.

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:05.810
So now, in disguise,
I multiplied by 0.

00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:07.890
But that turns out
to be legitimate.

00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:11.770
Because really this equation
is true for all x except 1.

00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:13.880
And then instead of taking
x = 1, I can really

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:15.580
take x tends to 1.

00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:17.200
That's really what I need.

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:18.530
The limit is x goes to one.

00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:20.610
The equation is still
valid then.

00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:23.220
So I'm using the worst case, the
case that looks like it's

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:24.360
dividing by 0.

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:26.870
And it's helping me because it's
cancelling out all the

00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:31.730
information in terms of B. So
the advantage here is this

00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:36.090
cancellation that occurs
in this part.

00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:37.440
So that's the method.

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:39.930
We're going to shorten it much,
much more in a second.

00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:44.640
But let me carry it out for the
other coefficient as well.

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:51.700
So the other coefficient I'm
going to solve for B, I'm

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:57.490
going to multiply by x + 2.

00:11:57.490 --> 00:12:01.620
And when I do that, I get 4x
- 1 / x - 1, that's the

00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:05.020
left-hand side, the very
top expression there.

00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:10.700
And then down below I get
A/ ( x - 1)( x + 2).

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:14.380
And then again the
x + 2's cancel.

00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:15.960
So I get B sitting alone.

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:18.150
And now I'm going to
do the same trick.

00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:21.540
I'm going to set x = - 2.

00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:27.270
That's the value which
is going to knock

00:12:27.270 --> 00:12:28.530
out this A term here.

00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:30.770
So that cancels this
term completely.

00:12:30.770 --> 00:12:37.950
And what we get here all told
is - 8 - 1 / - 2 - 1 = B. In

00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:43.090
other words, B = 3, which
was also what it

00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:44.100
was supposed to be.

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:48.460
B was this number
3, right here.

00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:50.820
Which I'm now not going
to change to 2.

00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:52.600
Because I know that
it's not 2.

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:53.370
There was a question.

00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:59.540
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:01.420
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:05.770
Now, this is the method which
is called cover-up.

00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:09.490
But it's really carried out
much, much faster than this.

00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:11.880
So I'm going to review the
method and I'm going to show

00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:14.300
you what it is in general.

00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:23.030
So the first step is to factor
the denominator, Q. That's

00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:24.590
what I labeled 1 over there.

00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:29.350
That was the factorization of
the denominator up top.

00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:36.260
The second step is what I'm
going to call the setup.

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:37.250
That's step 2.

00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:41.060
And that's where I knew what I
was aiming for in advance.

00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:42.990
And I'm going to have to
explain to you in every

00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:45.780
instance exactly what this
setup should be.

00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:49.070
That is, what the unknowns
should be and what target,

00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:53.080
simplified expression,
we're aiming for.

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:54.950
So that's the setup.

00:13:54.950 --> 00:14:01.010
And then the third step is what
I'll now call cover-up.

00:14:01.010 --> 00:14:04.300
Which is just a very fast way
of doing what I did on this

00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:09.470
last board, which is solving for
the unknown coefficients.

00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:12.890
So now, let me perform
it for you again.

00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:14.170
Over here.

00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:17.750
So it's 4x - 1 divided
by, so this is to

00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:19.650
eliminate writing here.

00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:24.130
Handwriting it makes
it much faster.

00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:29.920
So this part just factoring the
denominator, that was 1,

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:31.290
that was step 1.

00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:34.320
And then step 2, again,
is the setup, which is

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:39.700
setting it up like this.

00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:42.580
Alright, that's the setup.

00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:46.540
And now I claim that without
writing very much, I can

00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:49.350
figure out what A and B are.

00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:51.350
Just by staring at this.

00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:54.470
So now what I'm going to do is
I'm just going to think what I

00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:55.720
did over there.

00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:57.570
And I'm just going to
do it directly.

00:14:57.570 --> 00:15:02.680
So let me show you what the
method consists of visually.

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:09.200
I'm going to cover up, that is,
knock out this factor, and

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:13.560
focus on this number here.

00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:16.240
And I'm going to plug in the
thing that makes the 0,

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:17.580
which is x = 1.

00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:20.180
So I'm plugging in x = 1.

00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:21.670
To this left-hand side.

00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:29.040
And what I get is 4 - 1 / 1 +
2 = A. Now, that's the same

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:29.820
thing I did over there.

00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:33.610
I just did it by skipping the
intermediate algebra step,

00:15:33.610 --> 00:15:35.860
which is a lot of writing.

00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:37.940
So the cover-up method
really amounts to

00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:38.580
the following thing.

00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:40.385
I'm thinking of multiplying
this over here.

00:15:40.385 --> 00:15:43.240
It cancels this and it gets
rid of everything else.

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:45.960
And it just leaves me with
A on the right-hand side.

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:47.680
And I have to get rid
of it on this side.

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:50.360
So in other words, by
eliminating this, I'm

00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:53.090
isolating a on the
right-hand side.

00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:55.860
So the cover-up is that
I'm covering this and

00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:57.670
getting A out of it.

00:15:57.670 --> 00:16:02.330
Similarly, I can do the same
thing with B. It's focused on

00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:04.720
the value x = - 2.

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:07.010
And b is what I'm getting
on the right-hand side.

00:16:07.010 --> 00:16:10.400
And then I have to
cover up this.

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:14.530
So if I cover up that, then
what's left over with x = - 2

00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:22.580
is again, - 8 - 1 / - 2 - 1.

00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:26.970
So this is the way the method
gets carried out in practice.

00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:32.070
Writing, essentially,
the least you can.

00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:40.140
Now, when you get to several
variables, it becomes just way

00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:42.170
more convenient to do this.

00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:45.660
So now, let me just review
when cover-up works.

00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:57.370
So this cover-up method
works if Q ( x) has

00:16:57.370 --> 00:17:06.060
distinct linear factors.

00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:11.780
And, so you need two
things here.

00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:14.570
It has to factor completely, the
denominator has to factor

00:17:14.570 --> 00:17:15.180
completely.

00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:20.920
And the degree of the numerator
has to be strictly

00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:27.750
less than the degree
of the denominator.

00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:30.080
I'm going to give you
an example here.

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:36.010
So, for instance, and this tells
you the general pattern

00:17:36.010 --> 00:17:38.070
of the setup also.

00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:44.090
Say you had x ^2 + 3x
+ 8, let's say.

00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:50.380
Over (x - 1) ( x - 2)( x + 5).

00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:52.920
So here I'm going to
tell you the setup.

00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:58.710
The setup is going to be
A / (x - 1) + B / (x -

00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:02.820
2) + c / x + 5.

00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:04.620
And it will always break
up into something.

00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:07.570
So however many factors you
have, you'll have to put in a

00:18:07.570 --> 00:18:09.770
term for each of those.

00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:13.300
And then you can find
each number here by

00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:26.060
this cover-up method.

00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:29.450
Now we're done with that.

00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:33.280
And now we have to go on to the
algebraic complications.

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:38.420
So would the first typical
algebraic complication be.

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:50.760
It would be repeated roots
or repeated factors.

00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:54.190
Let me get one that doesn't
come out to be

00:18:54.190 --> 00:18:56.850
extremely ugly here.

00:18:56.850 --> 00:19:02.930
So this is what we'll
call Example 2.

00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:06.510
And this is going to work when
the degree, you always need

00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:08.650
that the degree of the numerator
is less than the

00:19:08.650 --> 00:19:12.060
degree of the denominator.

00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:22.980
And Q has now repeated
linear factors.

00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:26.030
So let's see which example
I wanted to show you.

00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:28.830
So let's just give this here.

00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:34.080
I'll just repeat the
denominator.

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:39.580
With an extra factor
like this.

00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:42.110
Now, the main thing you need
to know, since I've already

00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:44.370
performed the factorization
for you.

00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:46.140
Already performed Step 1.

00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:49.350
This is Step 1 here.

00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:51.540
You have to factor things all
the way, and that's already

00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:53.910
been done for you.

00:19:53.910 --> 00:19:56.840
And here's what this setup is.

00:19:56.840 --> 00:20:01.820
The setup is that it's of
the form A / (x - 1)

00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:05.540
+ B / (x - 1) ^2.

00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:15.590
We need another term for the
square here. + C / (x + 2).

00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:17.950
In general, if you have more
powers you just need to keep

00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:19.310
on putting in those powers.

00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:24.140
You need one for each
of the powers.

00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:26.340
Why does it have to be squared?

00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:27.570
OK.

00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:28.680
Good question.

00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:31.660
So why in the world
am I doing this?

00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:37.070
Let me just give you one hint
as to why I'm doing this.

00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:41.600
It's very, very much like the
decimal expansion of a number

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:44.820
or, say, the base 2 expansion
of a number.

00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:57.750
So, for, example the number 7/16
is 0 / 2 + 1 / 2 ^2 + 1/2

00:20:57.750 --> 00:21:02.120
^3 +, is that right?

00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:07.300
So it's 4/16 + 1/2 ^4.

00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:09.090
It's this sort of thing.

00:21:09.090 --> 00:21:11.880
And I'm getting this power
and this power.

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:13.760
If I have higher powers,
I'm going to have to

00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:14.500
have more and more.

00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:17.310
So this is what happens
when I have a 2 ^ 4.

00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:20.550
I have to represent
things like this.

00:21:20.550 --> 00:21:23.840
That's what's coming out
of this piece with the

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:24.930
repetitious here.

00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:26.390
Of the powers.

00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:31.070
This is just an analogy.

00:21:31.070 --> 00:21:31.930
Of what we're doing.

00:21:31.930 --> 00:21:33.280
Yeah, another question
over here.

00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:34.460
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:35.080
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:37.350
So this is an example, but it's
meant to represent the

00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:41.210
general case and I will also
give you a general picture.

00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:43.820
For sure, once you have the
second power here, you'll need

00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:46.790
both the first and the second
power mentioned over here.

00:21:46.790 --> 00:21:48.960
And since there's only a first
power over here I only have to

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:52.060
mention a first power
over there.

00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:55.790
If this were a 3 here, there
would be one more term which

00:21:55.790 --> 00:22:00.630
would be the one for x - 1
^2 in the denominator.

00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:03.940
That's what you just said.

00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:09.400
OK, now, what's different about
this setup is that the

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:11.810
cover-up method, although
it works, it

00:22:11.810 --> 00:22:13.120
doesn't work so well.

00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:14.660
It doesn't work quite as well.

00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:33.940
The cover-up works for the
coefficients B and C, not A.

00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:38.710
We'll have a quick method for
the numbers B and C. To figure

00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:40.530
out what they are.

00:22:40.530 --> 00:22:43.820
But it will be a little slower
to get to A, which we will do

00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:56.780
last. Let me show you
how it works.

00:22:56.780 --> 00:23:01.610
First of all, I'm going to do
the ordinary cover-up with C.

00:23:01.610 --> 00:23:05.640
So for C, I just want
to do the same old

00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:06.360
thing that I did before.

00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:10.260
I cover up this, and that's
going to get rid of all the

00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:12.300
junk except for the C term.

00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:16.800
So I have to plug x = - 2.

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:21.810
And I get x -- sorry, I get (-2
) ^2 + 2 in the numerator.

00:23:21.810 --> 00:23:25.660
And I get (- 2 - 1)^2
in the denominator.

00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:28.690
Remember I'm covering this up.

00:23:28.690 --> 00:23:30.790
So that's all there is on
the left-hand side.

00:23:30.790 --> 00:23:38.300
And on the right-hand side all
there is C. Everything else

00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:40.580
got killed off, because it
was x - 2 times that.

00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:42.570
That's 0 times all
that other stuff.

00:23:42.570 --> 00:23:45.240
And the x - 2 over
here canceled.

00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:47.710
This is the shortcut that I just
described, and this is

00:23:47.710 --> 00:23:50.920
much faster than doing
all that arithmetic.

00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:52.620
And algebra.

00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:57.160
So all together this
is a 6/9, right?

00:23:57.160 --> 00:24:09.140
So it's C = 6/9, which is 2/3.

00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:13.500
Now, the other one which is easy
to do, I'm going to do by

00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:17.350
the slow method first.
But you omit a term.

00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:23.380
The idea is to cover up
the other bad factor.

00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:27.480
Cover ups, I'll do it both
the way and the slow way.

00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:29.330
I'll do it the fast way first,
and then I'll show

00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:30.440
you the slow way.

00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:32.470
The fast way is to
cover this up.

00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:34.300
And then I have to cover
up everything else.

00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:35.740
That gets eliminated.

00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:39.150
And that includes everything
but B. So I

00:24:39.150 --> 00:24:40.950
get B on this side.

00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:42.970
And I get 1 on that side.

00:24:42.970 --> 00:24:48.340
So that's 1 ^2 + 2 / 1 + 2.

00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:56.250
So in other words, B = 1.

00:24:56.250 --> 00:24:58.710
That was pretty fast, so let
me show you what arithmetic

00:24:58.710 --> 00:25:00.060
was hiding behind that.

00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:01.690
What algebra was hiding
behind it.

00:25:01.690 --> 00:25:06.900
What I was really
doing is this.

00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:16.390
In multiplying through by
x - 1 ^2, so I got this.

00:25:16.390 --> 00:25:19.910
So this canceled here, so this
C just stands alone.

00:25:19.910 --> 00:25:26.290
And then I have here C
/x + 2 (x - 1) ^2.

00:25:26.290 --> 00:25:30.910
Notice again, I cleared out
that 1, this term from the

00:25:30.910 --> 00:25:33.600
denominator and sent it over
to the other side.

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:41.870
Now, what's happening is that
when I set x = 1 here, this

00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:43.050
term is dying.

00:25:43.050 --> 00:25:45.840
This term is going away, because
there's more powers in

00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:47.840
the numerator than in
the denominator.

00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:50.070
This is still 0.

00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:52.330
And this one is gone also.

00:25:52.330 --> 00:25:58.280
So all that's left is B. Now, I
cannot pull that off with a

00:25:58.280 --> 00:25:59.820
single power of x - 1.

00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:02.250
I can't expose the A term.

00:26:02.250 --> 00:26:04.230
It's the B term that
I can expose.

00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:06.170
Because I can multiply through
by this thing squared.

00:26:06.170 --> 00:26:10.390
If I multiply through by just x
- 1, what'll happen here is

00:26:10.390 --> 00:26:12.520
I won't have canceled
this (x - 1 )^2.

00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:13.160
It's useless.

00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:15.020
I still have a 0 in
the denominator.

00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:17.150
I'll have B / 0 when
I plug in x = 1.

00:26:17.150 --> 00:26:22.060
Which I can't use.

00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:32.950
Again, the cover-up method is
giving us B and C, not A.

00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:38.520
Now, for the last term, for A,
I'm going to just have to be

00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:40.380
straightforward about it.

00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:48.780
And so I'll just suggest
for A, plug in

00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:51.260
your favorite number.

00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:59.510
So plug in my favorite number.

00:26:59.510 --> 00:27:01.430
Which is x = 0.

00:27:01.430 --> 00:27:04.860
And you won't be able to
plug in x = 0 if you've

00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:05.700
already used it.

00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:08.440
Here the two numbers we've
already used are x

00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:13.820
= 1 and x = - 2.

00:27:13.820 --> 00:27:18.300
But we haven't used x =
0 yet, so that's good.

00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:21.400
I'm going to plug in now x
= 0 into the equation.

00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:22.450
What do I get?

00:27:22.450 --> 00:27:35.070
I get 0 ^2 + 2 / (- 1) ^2 *
2 is equal to, let's see.

00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:36.800
A is the thing that
I don't know.

00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:44.630
So it's A / - 1 +, B /
x - 1 ^2 so B = 1, so

00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:48.190
that's 1 / (- 1) ^2.

00:27:48.190 --> 00:27:51.760
And then C was 2/3.

00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:55.256
2/3 / x + 2.

00:27:55.256 --> 00:28:00.900
So that's 0 + 2.

00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:02.690
Don't give up at this point.

00:28:02.690 --> 00:28:03.900
This is a lot of algebra.

00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:06.290
You really have to plug
in all these numbers.

00:28:06.290 --> 00:28:08.400
You make one arithmetic mistake
and you're always

00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:09.480
going to get the wrong answer.

00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:16.790
This is very arithmetically
intensive.

00:28:16.790 --> 00:28:18.980
However, it does simplify
at this point.

00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:22.680
We have 2 / 2, that's 1.

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:27.790
Is equal to - A + 1 + 1/3.

00:28:27.790 --> 00:28:29.050
So let's see.

00:28:29.050 --> 00:28:34.920
A on the other side, this
becomes A = 1/3.

00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:35.520
And that's it.

00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:36.600
This is the end.

00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:40.020
We've we've simplified
our function.

00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:48.290
And now it's easy to integrate.

00:28:48.290 --> 00:28:48.780
Question.

00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:49.350
Another question.

00:28:49.350 --> 00:29:02.010
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:02.010 --> 00:29:04.230
PROFESSOR: So the question is,
if x = 0 has already been

00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:05.590
used, what do I do?

00:29:05.590 --> 00:29:10.050
And the answer is, pick
something else.

00:29:10.050 --> 00:29:11.440
And you said pick
a random number.

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:13.940
And that's right, except that if
you really picked a random

00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:19.110
number it would be 4.12567843,
which would be difficult.

00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:21.780
What you want to pick is the
easiest possible number you

00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:24.450
can think of.

00:29:24.450 --> 00:29:24.740
Yeah.

00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:32.710
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:37.050
PROFESSOR: If you had, as in
this sort of situation here.

00:29:37.050 --> 00:29:39.690
More powers.

00:29:39.690 --> 00:29:41.610
Wouldn't you have
more variables.

00:29:41.610 --> 00:29:42.900
Very good question.

00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:44.490
That's absolutely right.

00:29:44.490 --> 00:29:48.440
This was a 3 by 3 system in
disguise, for these three

00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:51.580
unknowns, A, B and C. What we
started with in the previous

00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:53.950
problem was two variables.

00:29:53.950 --> 00:29:57.430
It's over here, the variables A
and B. And as the degree of

00:29:57.430 --> 00:30:02.900
the denominator goes up, the
number of variables goes up.

00:30:02.900 --> 00:30:05.040
It gets more and more and
more complicated.

00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:06.820
More and more arithmetically
intensive.

00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:09.220
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:09.910
PROFESSOR: Well, so.

00:30:09.910 --> 00:30:11.170
The question is, how would
you solve it if

00:30:11.170 --> 00:30:12.880
you have two unknowns.

00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:16.610
That's exactly the point here.

00:30:16.610 --> 00:30:18.420
This is a system
of simultaneous

00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:19.560
equations for unknowns.

00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:23.180
And we have little tricks for
isolating single variables.

00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:25.880
Otherwise we're stuck with
solving the whole system.

00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:28.560
And you'd have to solve the
whole system by elimination,

00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:35.980
various other tricks.

00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:38.950
I'll say a little more
about that later.

00:30:38.950 --> 00:30:47.610
Now, I have to get one
step more complicated

00:30:47.610 --> 00:30:53.560
with my next example.

00:30:53.560 --> 00:31:02.860
My next example is going to
have a quadratic factor.

00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:05.900
So still I'm sticking to the
degree of the polynomial and

00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:08.570
the numerator is less than the
degree of the polynomial in

00:31:08.570 --> 00:31:09.660
the denominator.

00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:12.100
And I'm going to take
the case where Q

00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:21.700
has a quadratic factor.

00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:26.140
Let me just again illustrate
this by example.

00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:30.470
I have here (x - 1) (x^2 + 1).

00:31:30.470 --> 00:31:34.630
I'll make it about as
easy as they come.

00:31:34.630 --> 00:31:38.830
Now, the setup will be slightly
different here.

00:31:38.830 --> 00:31:40.510
Here's the setup.

00:31:40.510 --> 00:31:42.570
It's already factored.

00:31:42.570 --> 00:31:44.360
I've already done as
much as I can do.

00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:48.720
I can't factor this x^2 + 1 into
linear factors unless you

00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:49.940
know about complex numbers.

00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:52.380
If you know about complex
numbers this method becomes

00:31:52.380 --> 00:31:53.170
much easier.

00:31:53.170 --> 00:31:55.400
And it comes back to the
cover-up method.

00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:58.370
Which is the way that the
cover-up method was originally

00:31:58.370 --> 00:32:01.060
conceived by heavy side.

00:32:01.060 --> 00:32:04.280
But you won't get to
that until 18.03.

00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:05.610
So we'll wait.

00:32:05.610 --> 00:32:08.360
This, by the way, is a method
which is used for integration.

00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:11.580
But it was invented to do
something with Laplace

00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:14.410
transforms and inversion
of certain kinds of

00:32:14.410 --> 00:32:15.600
differential equations.

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:17.020
By heavy side.

00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:21.530
And so it came much later
than integration.

00:32:21.530 --> 00:32:26.360
But anyway, it's a very
convenient method.

00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:30.210
So here's the set up
with this one.

00:32:30.210 --> 00:32:34.440
Again, we want a term for
this (x - 1) factor.

00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:36.690
And now we're going to also
have a term with the

00:32:36.690 --> 00:32:39.120
denominator x squared plus 1.

00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:40.760
But this is the difference.

00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:44.590
It's now going to be a first
degree polynomial.

00:32:44.590 --> 00:32:53.040
One degree down from
the quadratic here.

00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:55.620
So this is what I keep
on calling the setup,

00:32:55.620 --> 00:32:57.250
this is number 2.

00:32:57.250 --> 00:32:59.870
You have to know that in advance
based on the pattern

00:32:59.870 --> 00:33:03.350
that you see on the
left-hand side.

00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:03.660
Yes.

00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:13.680
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:15.130
PROFESSOR: The question is, if
the degree of the numerator.

00:33:15.130 --> 00:33:19.520
So in this case, if this were
cubed, and this is matching

00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:23.590
with the denominator, which
is total of degree 3.

00:33:23.590 --> 00:33:26.910
The answer is that this
does not work.

00:33:26.910 --> 00:33:29.150
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:29.150 --> 00:33:31.260
PROFESSOR: It definitely
doesn't work.

00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:32.950
And we're going to have to
do something totally

00:33:32.950 --> 00:33:34.050
different to handle it.

00:33:34.050 --> 00:33:37.180
Which turns out, fortunately,
to be much easier than this.

00:33:37.180 --> 00:33:41.850
But we'll deal with
that at the end.

00:33:41.850 --> 00:33:43.320
Keep this in mind.

00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:45.500
This is an easy way to make a
mistake if you start with a

00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:47.230
higher degree numerator.

00:33:47.230 --> 00:33:51.300
You'll never get the
right answer.

00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:54.870
So now, so I have
my setup now.

00:33:54.870 --> 00:33:56.840
And now what can I do?

00:33:56.840 --> 00:34:03.970
Well, I claim that I can still
do cover-up for A.

00:34:03.970 --> 00:34:05.790
It's the same idea.

00:34:05.790 --> 00:34:07.680
I cover this guy up.

00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:10.460
And if I really multiply by it
it would knock everything out

00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:14.550
but A. So I cover this up
and I plug in x = 1.

00:34:14.550 --> 00:34:25.460
So I get here 1 ^2 / 1 ^2 + 1 =
A. In other words, A = 1/2.

00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:28.560
Again cover-up is pretty
fast, as you can see.

00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:32.030
It's not too bad.

00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:42.330
Now, at this next stage, I want
to find B and C. And the

00:34:42.330 --> 00:34:45.990
best idea is the slow way.

00:34:45.990 --> 00:34:48.120
Here, it's not too terrible.

00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:50.010
But it's just what we're
going to do.

00:34:50.010 --> 00:34:54.270
Which is to clear the
denominators completely.

00:34:54.270 --> 00:35:05.520
So for B and C, just clear
the denominator.

00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:08.220
That means multiply through
by that whole business.

00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:09.770
Now, when you do that on the
left-hand side you're

00:35:09.770 --> 00:35:10.870
going to get x ^2.

00:35:10.870 --> 00:35:12.940
Because I got rid of the
whole denominator.

00:35:12.940 --> 00:35:17.100
On the right-hand side when I
bring this up, the x - 1 will

00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:18.600
cancel with this.

00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:23.160
So the a term will
be A ( x ^2 + 1).

00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:29.230
And the Bx + C term will have
a remaining factor of x - 1.

00:35:29.230 --> 00:35:33.300
Because the x ^2 +
1 will cancel.

00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:38.670
Again, the arithmetic here
is not too terrible.

00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:41.000
Now I'm going to do
the following.

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:46.550
I'm going to look at
the x ^2 term.

00:35:46.550 --> 00:35:49.580
On the left-hand side and
the right-hand side.

00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:52.370
And that will give me one
equation for B and C. And then

00:35:52.370 --> 00:35:54.490
I'm going to do the same thing
with another term.

00:35:54.490 --> 00:35:57.350
The x^2 term on the left-hand
side, the coefficient is 1.

00:35:57.350 --> 00:35:59.740
It's 1 ( x ^2).

00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:06.250
On the other side, it's A.
remember I actually have A. So

00:36:06.250 --> 00:36:08.870
I'm going to put it
in, it's 1/2.

00:36:08.870 --> 00:36:11.250
So this is the A term.

00:36:11.250 --> 00:36:14.020
And so I get 1/2 ( x ^2).

00:36:14.020 --> 00:36:16.310
And then the only other
x^2 is when this Bx

00:36:16.310 --> 00:36:18.640
multiplies this x.

00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:24.275
So Bx * x is Bx ^2, so this is
the other coefficient on x ^2

00:36:24.275 --> 00:36:36.060
is B. And that forces
B to be 1/2.

00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:41.370
And last of all, I'm going to
do the x^ 0 power term.

00:36:41.370 --> 00:36:44.530
Or, otherwise known as
the constant term.

00:36:44.530 --> 00:36:48.650
And on the left-hand side,
the constant term is 0.

00:36:48.650 --> 00:36:51.270
There is no constant term.

00:36:51.270 --> 00:36:57.310
On the right-hand side there's
a constant term, 1/2 * 1.

00:36:57.310 --> 00:36:58.520
That's 1/2 here.

00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:01.580
And then there's another
constant term, which is this

00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:03.860
constant times this - 1.

00:37:03.860 --> 00:37:10.630
Which is - C. And so
the conclusion

00:37:10.630 --> 00:37:18.070
here is that C = 1/2.

00:37:18.070 --> 00:37:18.660
Another question.

00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:19.030
Yeah.

00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:33.130
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:33.130 --> 00:37:37.970
PROFESSOR: There's also an x^
0 power hidden in here.

00:37:37.970 --> 00:37:40.890
Sorry, an x ^ 1 , that's what
you were asking about, sorry.

00:37:40.890 --> 00:37:42.400
There's also an x ^ 1 .

00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:45.600
The only reason why I didn't
go to the x^ 1 is that it

00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:49.080
turns out with these two
I didn't need it.

00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:51.650
The other thing is that by
experience, I know that the

00:37:51.650 --> 00:37:53.320
extreme ends of the
multiplication

00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:54.690
are the easiest ends.

00:37:54.690 --> 00:37:57.830
And the middle terms have tons
of cross terms. And so I don't

00:37:57.830 --> 00:38:00.080
like the middle term as much
because it always involves

00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:01.130
more arithmetic.

00:38:01.130 --> 00:38:05.530
So I stick to the lowest and
the highest terms if I can.

00:38:05.530 --> 00:38:07.390
So that was really
a sneaky thing.

00:38:07.390 --> 00:38:10.470
I did that without
saying anything.

00:38:10.470 --> 00:38:10.960
Yes.

00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:14.440
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:15.470
PROFESSOR: Another
good question.

00:38:15.470 --> 00:38:17.120
Could I just set equals 0?

00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:17.910
Absolutely.

00:38:17.910 --> 00:38:22.370
In fact, that's equivalent to
picking out the x^ 0 term.

00:38:22.370 --> 00:38:24.150
And you could plug in numbers.

00:38:24.150 --> 00:38:25.140
If you wanted.

00:38:25.140 --> 00:38:27.820
That's another way of doing
this besides doing that.

00:38:27.820 --> 00:38:30.930
So you can also plug
in numbers.

00:38:30.930 --> 00:38:38.060
Can plug in numbers. x = 0.

00:38:38.060 --> 00:38:44.330
Actually, not x = 1,
right? - 1, 2, etc.

00:38:44.330 --> 00:38:46.000
Not 1 just because we've
already used it.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.400
We won't get interesting
information out.

00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:48.770
Yes.

00:38:48.770 --> 00:38:56.820
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:56.820 --> 00:38:58.290
PROFESSOR: So the question
is, could I have done

00:38:58.290 --> 00:38:59.900
it this other way.

00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:02.880
With the polynomial, with
this other one.

00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:04.020
Yes, absolutely.

00:39:04.020 --> 00:39:07.210
So in other words what I've
taught you now is two choices

00:39:07.210 --> 00:39:09.480
which are equally reasonable.

00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:12.670
The one that I picked was the
one that was the fastest for

00:39:12.670 --> 00:39:15.700
this guy and the one that was
fastest for this one, but I

00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:19.040
could've done the other
way around.

00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:20.990
There are a lot of
ways of solving

00:39:20.990 --> 00:39:22.490
simultaneous equations.

00:39:22.490 --> 00:39:23.803
Yeah, another question.

00:39:23.803 --> 00:39:24.610
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:24.610 --> 00:39:25.930
PROFESSOR: The question
is the following.

00:39:25.930 --> 00:39:28.610
So now everybody can understand
the question.

00:39:28.610 --> 00:39:33.640
If this, instead of being x
^2 + 1, this were x^3 + 1.

00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:36.360
So that's an important
case to understand.

00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:38.910
That's a case in which
this denominator

00:39:38.910 --> 00:39:41.020
is not fully factored.

00:39:41.020 --> 00:39:46.830
So it's an x^3 + 1, you would
have to factor out an x + 1.

00:39:46.830 --> 00:39:49.350
So that would be a situation
like this, you have an x^3 +

00:39:49.350 --> 00:39:57.740
1, but that's (x + 1)( x^2 +
x + 1), this kind of thing.

00:39:57.740 --> 00:39:59.770
If that's the right, there
must be a minus

00:39:59.770 --> 00:40:01.830
sign in here maybe.

00:40:01.830 --> 00:40:03.240
OK, something like this.

00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:07.360
Right?

00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:08.190
Isn't that what it is?

00:40:08.190 --> 00:40:12.000
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:12.810
PROFESSOR: I think it's right.

00:40:12.810 --> 00:40:15.930
But anyway, the point is that
you have to factor it.

00:40:15.930 --> 00:40:17.920
And then you have a linear
and a quadratic.

00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:21.390
So you're always going to be
faced eventually with linear

00:40:21.390 --> 00:40:23.910
factors and quadratic factors.

00:40:23.910 --> 00:40:25.650
If you have a cubic, that means
you haven't factored

00:40:25.650 --> 00:40:28.620
sufficiently.

00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:32.490
So you're still back
in Step 1.

00:40:32.490 --> 00:40:32.780
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:32.780 --> 00:40:34.500
PROFESSOR: In the
x^3 + 1 case?

00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:36.610
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:36.610 --> 00:40:39.610
PROFESSOR: In the x^3 + 1 case,
we are out of luck until

00:40:39.610 --> 00:40:41.700
we've completed the
factorization.

00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:44.160
Once we've completed the
factorization, we're going to

00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:48.920
have to deal with these two
factors as denominators.

00:40:48.920 --> 00:40:54.410
So it'll be this plus something
over x + 1 + a Bx +

00:40:54.410 --> 00:40:58.160
C type of thing over
this thing here.

00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:01.730
That's what's eventually
going to happen.

00:41:01.730 --> 00:41:03.940
But hold on to that idea.

00:41:03.940 --> 00:41:14.340
Let me carry out one
more example here.

00:41:14.340 --> 00:41:17.870
So I've figured out what
all the values are.

00:41:17.870 --> 00:41:21.910
But I think it's also worth it
to remember now that we also

00:41:21.910 --> 00:41:29.140
have to carry out
the integration.

00:41:29.140 --> 00:41:36.590
What I've just shown you is that
the integral of x ^2 dx

00:41:36.590 --> 00:41:42.770
over (x - 1)( x ^2 + 1) is equal
to, and I've split up

00:41:42.770 --> 00:41:43.970
into these pieces.

00:41:43.970 --> 00:41:45.070
So what are the pieces?

00:41:45.070 --> 00:42:01.560
The pieces are, 1/2, x -
1 + 1/2 x / x ^2 + 1.

00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:02.990
This is the A term.

00:42:02.990 --> 00:42:04.400
This is the B term.

00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:12.460
And then there's the C term.

00:42:12.460 --> 00:42:15.550
So we'd better remember
that we know how to

00:42:15.550 --> 00:42:18.300
antidifferentiate
these things.

00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:20.320
In other words, I want to
finish the problem.

00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:22.680
The others were pretty easy, so
I didn't bother to finish

00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:25.680
my sentence, but here I want
to be careful and have you

00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:28.850
realize that there's something
a little more to do.

00:42:28.850 --> 00:42:31.340
First of all we have the, the
first one is no problem.

00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:35.240
That's this.

00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:39.910
The second one actually
is not too bad either.

00:42:39.910 --> 00:42:45.880
This is, by the advanced
guessing method, my favorite

00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:48.660
method, something like the
logarithm, because that's

00:42:48.660 --> 00:42:50.070
what's going to appear
in the denominator.

00:42:50.070 --> 00:42:51.935
And then, if you differentiate
this, you're going

00:42:51.935 --> 00:42:53.620
to get 2x over this.

00:42:53.620 --> 00:42:55.030
But here we have 1/2.

00:42:55.030 --> 00:42:59.470
So altogether it's
1/4 of this.

00:42:59.470 --> 00:43:02.470
So I fixed the coefficient
here.

00:43:02.470 --> 00:43:06.580
And then the last one, you have
to think back to some

00:43:06.580 --> 00:43:10.310
level of memorization here and
remember that this is 1/2 the

00:43:10.310 --> 00:43:15.610
arc tangent.

00:43:15.610 --> 00:43:20.870
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:20.870 --> 00:43:22.200
PROFESSOR: Why did
I go to 1/4?

00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:26.810
Because in disguise, for this
guy, I was thinking d / dx of

00:43:26.810 --> 00:43:35.140
ln (x ^2 + 1) = 2x / x^2 + 1.

00:43:35.140 --> 00:43:39.880
Because it's the derivative
of this divided by itself.

00:43:39.880 --> 00:43:46.140
This is the derivative
of ln u is u ' / u.

00:43:46.140 --> 00:43:50.030
Ln u' = u' / u.

00:43:50.030 --> 00:43:54.350
That was what I applied.

00:43:54.350 --> 00:43:58.210
And what I had was 1/2, so I
need a total of 1/4 to cancel.

00:43:58.210 --> 00:44:06.640
So 2/4 is 1/2.

00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:09.990
Now I've got to get you out
of one more deep hole.

00:44:09.990 --> 00:44:12.900
And I'm going to save the
general pattern for next time.

00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:27.860
But I do want to clarify
one thing.

00:44:27.860 --> 00:44:30.040
So let's handle this thing.

00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:34.240
What if the degree of P is
bigger than or equal to the

00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:42.810
degree of Q. That's the thing
that I claimed was easier.

00:44:42.810 --> 00:44:45.880
And I'm going to describe
to you how it's done.

00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:49.990
Now, in analogy, with numbers
you might call this an

00:44:49.990 --> 00:44:55.070
improper fraction.

00:44:55.070 --> 00:45:00.100
That's the thing that should
echo in your mind when you're

00:45:00.100 --> 00:45:01.970
thinking about this.

00:45:01.970 --> 00:45:04.600
And I'm just going to do
it by example here.

00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:08.860
Let's see., I cooked up an
example so that I don't make

00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:11.220
an arithmetistic mistake
along the way.

00:45:11.220 --> 00:45:16.990
So there are two or three steps
that I need to explain.

00:45:16.990 --> 00:45:18.030
So here's an example.

00:45:18.030 --> 00:45:21.320
The denominator's degree 2,
the numerator is degree 3.

00:45:21.320 --> 00:45:24.610
It well exceeds, so there's
a problem here.

00:45:24.610 --> 00:45:27.880
Our method is not
going to work.

00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:32.620
And the first step that I
want to carry out is to

00:45:32.620 --> 00:45:36.370
reverse Step 1.

00:45:36.370 --> 00:45:38.940
That is, I don't want the
factorization for what I'm

00:45:38.940 --> 00:45:39.620
going to do next.

00:45:39.620 --> 00:45:42.040
I want it multiplied out.

00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:44.230
That means I have to multiply
through, so I

00:45:44.230 --> 00:45:48.670
get x ^2 + x - 2.

00:45:48.670 --> 00:45:52.980
I'm back to the starting
place here.

00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:57.115
And now, the next thing that I'm
going to do is, I'm going

00:45:57.115 --> 00:46:01.130
to use long division.

00:46:01.130 --> 00:46:03.400
That's how you convert
an improper

00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:07.530
fraction to a proper fraction.

00:46:07.530 --> 00:46:12.710
This is something you were
supposed to learn in, I don't

00:46:12.710 --> 00:46:16.780
know, Grade 4, I know.

00:46:16.780 --> 00:46:23.970
Grade 3, Grade 4, Grade
5, Grade 6, etc.

00:46:23.970 --> 00:46:27.560
So here's how it works in
the case of polynomials.

00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:31.030
It's kind of amusing.

00:46:31.030 --> 00:46:37.760
So we're dividing this
polynomial into that one.

00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:41.950
And so the quotient to first
order here is x.

00:46:41.950 --> 00:46:44.710
That is, that's going to match
the top terms. So I get

00:46:44.710 --> 00:46:48.500
x^3 + x ^2 - 2x.

00:46:48.500 --> 00:46:50.310
That's the product.

00:46:50.310 --> 00:46:51.890
And now I subtract.

00:46:51.890 --> 00:46:53.990
And it cancels.

00:46:53.990 --> 00:46:58.440
So we get here - x ^2 + 2x.

00:46:58.440 --> 00:47:01.110
That's the difference.

00:47:01.110 --> 00:47:04.260
And now I need to divide
this next term in.

00:47:04.260 --> 00:47:08.190
And I need a - 1.

00:47:08.190 --> 00:47:14.700
So - 1 times this is
- x ^2 - x + 2.

00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:16.260
And I subtract.

00:47:16.260 --> 00:47:17.800
And the x^2's cancel.

00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:24.210
And here I get + 3x - 2.

00:47:24.210 --> 00:47:27.090
Now, this thing has a name.

00:47:27.090 --> 00:47:30.880
This is called the quotient.

00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:33.090
And this thing also
has a name.

00:47:33.090 --> 00:47:39.070
This is called the remainder.

00:47:39.070 --> 00:47:43.960
And now I'll show you how it
works by sticking it into the

00:47:43.960 --> 00:47:44.560
answer here.

00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:47.250
The quotient is x - 1.

00:47:47.250 --> 00:47:51.000
And the remainder is, let's
get down there.

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:58.820
3x - 2 / x ^2 + x - 2.

00:47:58.820 --> 00:48:03.110
So the punchline here
is that this

00:48:03.110 --> 00:48:05.450
thing is easy to integrate.

00:48:05.450 --> 00:48:08.190
This is easy.

00:48:08.190 --> 00:48:17.460
And this one, you can use, now
you can use cover-up, The

00:48:17.460 --> 00:48:18.480
method that we had before.

00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:21.490
Because the degree of the
numerator is now below the

00:48:21.490 --> 00:48:22.700
degree of the denominator.

00:48:22.700 --> 00:48:25.920
It's now first degree and
this is second degree.

00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:27.960
What you can't do is
use cover-up to

00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:29.950
start out with here.

00:48:29.950 --> 00:48:32.630
That will give you
the wrong answer.

00:48:32.630 --> 00:48:37.320
So that's the end for today,
and see you next time.
