00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:08.160
(Singing) I hate to see the evening sun go down

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.420
(Spoken) I had a dream I was dancing with the dead

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.800
We were swinging, with hollow voices, hollow bones,

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.760
emptying our lungs of the cities we carried for decades.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.790
I knew they was dead cause they had memories,
wrapped around their necks, and their feet moved

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:31.120
so fast they didnâ€™t touch the floor.

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:37.800
You see, at night this body allows the multitude
within it to awake, for a rhapsody in blues
