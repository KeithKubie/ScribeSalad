00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:03.960
I think now is as good a time as
any to play around a little bit

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.100
with the formula for variance
and see where it goes.

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.330
And I think just by doing this
we'll also get a little bit

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:12.730
better intuition of just
manipulating sigma notation,

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:13.670
or even what it means.

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:18.989
So we learned several times
that the formula for variance--

00:00:18.989 --> 00:00:20.780
and let's just do
variance of a population.

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:22.905
It's almost the same thing
as variance of a sample.

00:00:22.905 --> 00:00:25.220
You just divide by n
instead of n minus 1.

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.910
Variance of a population
is equal to-- well,

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:32.350
you take each of the
data points x sub i.

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:35.000
You subtract from that the mean.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.150
You square it.

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.220
And then you take the
average of all of these.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:43.940
So you add the squared distance
for each of these points from i

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.480
equals 1 to i is equal to n.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.710
And you divide it by n.

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.780
So let's see what
happens if we can-- maybe

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.790
we want to multiply
out the squared term

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.610
and see where it takes us.

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:56.250
So let's see.

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.630
And I think it'll take
us someplace interesting.

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:08.590
So this is the same thing as the
sum from i is equal to 1 to n.

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:09.850
This, we just multiply it out.

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:16.690
This is the same thing as x
sub i squared minus-- this

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:18.945
is your little
algebra going on here.

00:01:18.945 --> 00:01:21.320
So when you square it-- I
mean, we could multiply it out.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:22.600
We could write it.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:30.010
x sub i minus mu times
x sub i minus mu.

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.720
So we have x sub i times x
sub i, that's x sub i squared.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.270
Then you have x sub
i times minus mu.

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.702
And then you have
minus mu times x sub i.

00:01:40.702 --> 00:01:42.160
So when you add
those two together,

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:48.560
you get minus 2x sub i mu,
because you have it twice. x

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.890
sub i times mu, that's
1 minus x sub i mu.

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.510
And then you have another
one, minus mu x sub i.

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.400
When you add them together,
you get minus 2x sub i mu.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.930
I know it's confusing with me
saying sub i and all of that.

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:01.513
But it's really no
different than when

00:02:01.513 --> 00:02:03.550
you did a minus b squared.

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:05.800
Just the variables look a
little bit more complicated.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.060
And then the last term is
minus mu times minus mu,

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.540
which is plus mu squared.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:15.700
Fair enough.

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.070
Let me switch colors just
to keep it interesting.

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.520
Let me cordon that off.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.270
The sum of this
is the same thing

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.186
as the sum of-- because
if you think about it,

00:02:27.186 --> 00:02:28.920
we're going to
take each x sub i.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.894
For each of the numbers
in our population,

00:02:30.894 --> 00:02:32.310
we're going to
perform this thing.

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:33.400
And we're going to sum it up.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.816
But if you think
about it, this is

00:02:34.816 --> 00:02:36.449
the same thing
as-- if you're not

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:38.490
familiar with sigma notation
this is a good thing

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.614
to know in general, just
a little bit of intuition.

00:02:40.614 --> 00:02:44.340
That this is the same thing as--
I'll do it here to have space.

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:52.500
The sum from i is equal to
1 to n of the first term,

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:59.900
x sub i squared minus--
and actually, we

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.900
can bring out the
constant terms.

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.140
When you're summing, the
only thing that matters

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.200
is the thing that
has the i-th term.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.450
So in this case, it's x sub i.

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:09.785
So x sub 1, x sub 2.

00:03:09.785 --> 00:03:11.160
So that's the
thing that you have

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.160
to leave on the right hand
side of the sigma notation.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.720
And if you've done the
calculus playlists already,

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.000
sigma notation is really
like a discrete integral

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.250
on some level.

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.350
Because in an integral, you're
summing up a bunch of things

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.146
and you're multiplying
them times dx,

00:03:27.146 --> 00:03:28.520
which is a really
small interval.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:29.936
But here you're
just taking a sum.

00:03:29.936 --> 00:03:33.120
And we showed in the
calculus playlist

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.440
that an integral actually
is this infinite sum

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:36.870
of infinitely
small things, but I

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.410
don't want to digress too much.

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.700
But this was just a long way
of saying that the sum from i

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.590
equals 1 to n of the second term
is the same thing as minus 2

00:03:45.590 --> 00:04:05.460
times mu of the sum from i is
equal to 1 to n of x sub i.

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:10.590
And then finally,
you have plus-- well,

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.142
this is just a constant term.

00:04:12.142 --> 00:04:13.350
This is just a constant term.

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:14.380
So you can take it out.

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:24.030
Times mu squared times the
sum from i equals 1 to n.

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.460
And what's going to be here?

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.340
It's going to be a 1.

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:29.320
We just divided a 1.

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:30.403
We just divided this by 1.

00:04:30.403 --> 00:04:32.610
And took it out of the
sigma sign, out of the sum.

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.060
And you're just
left with a 1 there.

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.870
And actually, we could have
just left the mu squared there.

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.670
But either way, let's
just keep simplifying it.

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:44.830
So this we can't really do--
well, actually we could.

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.490
Well, no, we don't know
what the x sub i's are.

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.120
So we just have to
leave that the same.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.720
So that's the sum.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.150
Oh sorry, and this is
just the numerator.

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.900
This whole simplification, we're
just simplifying the numerator.

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.830
And later, we're just
going to divide by n.

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.760
So that is equal to
that divided by n,

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.894
which is equal to this
thing divided by n.

00:05:02.894 --> 00:05:04.060
I'll divide by n at the end.

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:06.340
Because it's the numerator
that's the confusing part.

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.019
We just want to simplify
this term up here.

00:05:10.019 --> 00:05:11.060
So let's keep doing this.

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:15.910
So this equals the sum
from i equals 1 to n

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:19.695
of x sub i squared.

00:05:19.695 --> 00:05:25.860
And let's see, minus
2 times mu-- sorry,

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:27.400
that mu doesn't look good.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:35.710
Edit, Undo, minus 2 times
mu times the sum from i

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:42.210
is equal to 1 to n of xi.

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:43.670
And then, what is this?

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:45.390
What is another
way to write this?

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:48.860
Essentially, we're going
to add 1 to itself n times.

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:51.380
This is saying, just look,
whatever you have here,

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:53.619
just iterate through it n times.

00:05:53.619 --> 00:05:55.160
If you had an x sub
i here, you would

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.757
use the first x term,
then the second x term.

00:05:57.757 --> 00:06:00.090
When you have a 1 here, this
is just essentially saying,

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:04.820
add one to itself n times,
which is the same thing as n.

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:14.260
So this is going to be
plus mu squared times n.

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:21.787
And then see if there's
anything else we can do here.

00:06:21.787 --> 00:06:23.370
Remember, this was
just the numerator.

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:25.580
So this looks fine.

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:27.090
We add up each of those terms.

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:32.030
So we just have
minus 2 mu from i

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:36.260
equals 1 to-- oh well,
think about this.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:37.470
What is this?

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:40.330
What is this thing right here?

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:44.250
Well actually, let's
bring back that n.

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:46.480
So this simplified
to that divided

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:50.800
by n, which simplifies to
that whole thing, which

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:55.500
is simplified to this
whole thing, divided by n,

00:06:55.500 --> 00:07:00.464
which simplifies to this whole
thing divided by n, which

00:07:00.464 --> 00:07:02.880
is the same thing as each of
the terms divided by n, which

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:07.230
is the same thing as that,
which is the same thing as that,

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:10.290
which is the same thing as that.

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:12.060
And now, well, how
does this simplify?

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:13.770
This is the interesting part.

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:15.800
Well, this, nothing
much I can do here.

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:22.220
So that just becomes the
sum from i is equal to 1

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:28.590
to n x sub i squared
divided by big N.

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:31.080
Now this is interesting.

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:35.230
If I take each of the terms in
my population and I add them up

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:37.880
and then I divide it
by n, what is that?

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:41.190
This thing right here?

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:43.450
If I sum up all of the
terms in my population

00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:45.480
and divide by the number
of terms there are?

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:46.626
That's the mean, right?

00:07:46.626 --> 00:07:48.000
That's the mean
of my population.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.950
So this thing right
here is also mu.

00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:55.700
So this thing
simplifies to what?

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:58.040
Minus 2 times what?

00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:00.250
Mu times this whole
thing is mu too.

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:02.760
So times mu squared.

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:06.270
mu times mu, this is the
mean of the population.

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:08.120
So that was a nice
simplification.

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:11.565
And then plus-- what
do you have here?

00:08:11.565 --> 00:08:14.270
Well let's see,
you have n over n.

00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:15.060
Those cancel out.

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:16.490
So we just have plus mu squared.

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:18.670
So that was a very
nice simplification.

00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:21.910
And then this simplifies to--
can't do much on this side.

00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:36.669
So the sum from i is equal to 1
to n of x sub i squared over n.

00:08:36.669 --> 00:08:39.710
And then you see, we have minus
2 mu squared plus mu squared.

00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:47.380
Well, that's the same
thing as minus mu squared.

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:49.860
Minus the mean squared.

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:53.170
So this already we've
come up with a neat way

00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:58.090
of writing the variance.

00:08:58.090 --> 00:09:01.020
You can essentially take the
average of the squares of all

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:03.740
of the numbers in this
case, a population,

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:08.250
and then subtract from
that the mean squared

00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:09.070
of your population.

00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:11.444
So this could be, depending
on you're calculating things,

00:09:11.444 --> 00:09:15.009
maybe a slightly faster way
of calculating the variance.

00:09:15.009 --> 00:09:17.550
So just playing with a little
algebra, we got from this thing

00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:19.966
where you have to each time
take each of your data points,

00:09:19.966 --> 00:09:21.800
subtract the mean from
it, and then squared.

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:23.674
And of course, before
you have to do anything

00:09:23.674 --> 00:09:25.260
you have to calculate the mean.

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:26.260
And you take the square.

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:27.010
And then you sum them all up.

00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:28.800
Then you take the
average, essentially,

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:30.410
when you sum and divided by n.

00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:33.150
We've simplified it just
using a little bit of algebra

00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:34.650
to this formula.

00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:37.200
We're getting to something
called the raw score method.

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:40.160
And what we want to do is write
this right here just in terms

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:41.097
of xi's.

00:09:41.097 --> 00:09:43.180
And then we really are
what you call the raw score

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:45.030
method, which is
oftentimes a faster

00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:47.470
way of calculating the variance.

00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:49.950
So let's see what
is mu equal to?

00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:51.370
What is the mean?

00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:58.060
The mean is just equal to the
sum from i is equal to 1 to n

00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:00.780
of each of the terms-- you
just take the sum of each

00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:04.320
of the terms-- and you divide by
the number of terms there are.

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:09.890
So if we look at this
thing, this thing

00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:14.660
can be written as-- let
me draw a line here.

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:22.330
This thing can be written as the
sum from i is equal to 1 to n

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:30.360
of x sub 1 squared all of
that over n minus mu squared.

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:31.930
Well, mu is this.

00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:35.640
So this thing squared is what?

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:46.520
This is x sub i take
the sum up to n.

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:48.800
i is equal to 1.

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:51.980
You're going to
square this thing.

00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:54.620
And then you're going to divide
it by-- we squared, right?

00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:58.700
You divide it by n squared.

00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:01.570
And this might seem like a
more-- out of all of them,

00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:04.750
this actually seems like
the simplest formula for me.

00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:06.240
Where you essentially
just take--

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:09.230
if you know the mean
of your population--

00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:10.840
you just say, OK,
my mean is whatever

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:12.440
and I can just square that.

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:14.122
And just put that
aside for a second.

00:11:14.122 --> 00:11:16.080
But first, I can just
take each of the numbers,

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:17.990
square them, and
then sum them up,

00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:21.020
and divide by the number
of numbers I have.

00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:22.440
I don't know if I
wrote-- no, I've

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:24.010
erased the last set of numbers.

00:11:24.010 --> 00:11:25.420
But we could show
you that you'll

00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:26.480
get to the same variance.

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:28.480
So to me, this is almost
the simplest formula.

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:30.822
But this one's even
faster in a lot of ways

00:11:30.822 --> 00:11:32.780
because you don't really
have to even calculate

00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:34.470
the mean ahead of time.

00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:36.780
You can just say,
OK, for each xi

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:38.950
I just perform this operation.

00:11:38.950 --> 00:11:40.954
And then I divide by n
squared or n accordingly.

00:11:40.954 --> 00:11:42.370
And I'll also get
to the variance.

00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:44.760
So you don't have to do
this calculation before you

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:45.730
figure out the whole variance.

00:11:45.730 --> 00:11:48.188
But anyway, I thought it would
be instructive and hopefully

00:11:48.188 --> 00:11:50.870
give you a little bit more
intuition behind the algebra

00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:53.370
dealing with sigma
if we worked out

00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:54.870
these other ways
to write variances.

00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:56.828
And frankly, some books
will just say, oh yeah,

00:11:56.828 --> 00:11:57.440
you know what?

00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:59.399
The variance could
be written like this.

00:11:59.399 --> 00:12:01.440
We're talking about the
variance of a population.

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:02.940
Or it could be
written like this,

00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:04.726
or maybe they'll even
write it like this.

00:12:04.726 --> 00:12:06.350
And it's good to know
that you can just

00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:10.320
do a little simple
algebraic manipulation

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:11.920
and get from one to the other.

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:13.650
Anyway, I've run out of time.

00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:15.990
See you in the next video.
