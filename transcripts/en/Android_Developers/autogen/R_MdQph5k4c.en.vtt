00:00:04.444 --> 00:00:05.909
 My name is "Ji Chen" 

00:00:05.909 --> 00:00:07.287
 Chief Executive of Ufoto 

00:00:07.289 --> 00:00:09.549
 Since the company was founded in 2016 

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:12.309
 We have published many self-image applications 

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:14.969
 And participation across social networks in the global market. 

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.529
 Our first application, Sweet Selfie, 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.488
 Million active users per day in less than 3 months 

00:00:22.755 --> 00:00:25.419
 Highlighted on Google Play. 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:26.659
 To date 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.329
 The application has reached 300 million downloads worldwide. 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.679
 Sweet Snap focuses on animated posters 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.019
 And short videos with special effects. 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.222
 So that users can record happy memories in a more vivid way 

00:00:38.488 --> 00:00:40.711
 My name is Li Zeng, product manager at Ufoto 

00:00:40.977 --> 00:00:43.769
 As our products focus on the global market 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.380
 The set properties of self-images that include 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.949
 Beauty features, filters, collages, photo booth, frames and wallpapers 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.329
 Require that appropriate regionalization becomes a key to achieving a high and sustainable retention rate. 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.369
 For example, in India 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.929
 The crucifixes and pictures combined with the Holly Red Festival powder throw effects provided us with the ingredients 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.169
 Which allows users to celebrate the festival directly in the application. 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.749
 We use Firebase Remote Config to implement an effective operating strategy 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.329
 We use the A / B test 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.109
 To check the design method 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.870
 Now self-portrait assets are downloaded more than a million times a day 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:15.739
 And use it more than 5 million times a day. 

00:01:15.739 --> 00:01:18.129
 The share of self-image assets increased by 100%. 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.879
 Challenge in emerging markets such as India, Brazil and Mexico 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.309
 Is to deal with specifications 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:23.909
 Different devices and network connection. 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.169
 We use multiple APK packages 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.555
 To deploy different apk packages, each is routed to various settings. 

00:01:29.866 --> 00:01:32.799
 We have also developed various image processing algorithms 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.619
 For various hardware specifications. 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.039
 Thanks to Android Go, we can provide 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.938
 Improved experience on cheap phones. 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.009
 We removed unnecessary dynamic libraries in the application 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:44.879
 It was set to download smaller assets 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.549
 When it runs on a screen and a smaller storage space. 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.079
 To optimize performance, we dynamically allocate the cache 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.230
 Depending on the available memory size. 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:56.537
 If memory is low, a stronger reuse strategy will be used. 

00:01:56.537 --> 00:01:59.459
 Application size is 25% smaller on Android Go 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.733
 It uses 20% less memory. 

00:02:01.955 --> 00:02:03.859
 After setting up our apps to work on Android Go 

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:06.929
 Active Sweet Snap users increased by 465% daily. 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.399
 Self-portraits symbolize a life full of optimism. 

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.419
 These are self-portraits of smiling people 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.679
 Is what drives us to move forward. 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.219
 Google Play provides us with a global arena 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.529
 By allowing us to entertain Android users in different countries. 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.129
 We will continue trying to discover 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.949
 New ways to take self-portraits 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.656
 And help users around the world 

00:02:29.688 --> 00:02:33.377
 To record special moments in their lives.
