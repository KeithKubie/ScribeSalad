00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.560
Next, we will look at techniques that make independence instructions easier for

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:07.520
a processor to find. So ideal processor would find them because it is able to

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.720
look at an infinite number of instructions, potentially, but

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.260
the real processor can only see so many instructions ahead. So it actually

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.880
doesn't see that there are independent instructions further down the code.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.110
We will really look at two techniques. One is instruction scheduling for

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.430
simple branch-free sequences of instructions.

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.670
Then we will look at techniques specific to loops, such as loop unrolling, and

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.090
how they interact with the instruction scheduling, and then,

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.300
we will briefly look at the more powerful technique called trace scheduling.
