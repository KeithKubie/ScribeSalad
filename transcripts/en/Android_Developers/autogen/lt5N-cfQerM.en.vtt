hi I'm Nick butcher an engineer on the

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250
hi I'm Nick butcher an engineer on the
 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.280
hi I'm Nick butcher an engineer on the
Android developer relations team and I'm

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290
Android developer relations team and I'm
 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.140
Android developer relations team and I'm
here today with a design by to talk to

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150
here today with a design by to talk to
 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.420
here today with a design by to talk to
you about the fundamentals of responsive

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430
you about the fundamentals of responsive
 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.640
you about the fundamentals of responsive
design and how to employ them in your

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650
design and how to employ them in your
 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.790
design and how to employ them in your
Android application design so Android is

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800
Android application design so Android is
 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.950
Android application design so Android is
not a one-size-fits-all OS it comes in

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960
not a one-size-fits-all OS it comes in
 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.509
not a one-size-fits-all OS it comes in
many different sizes and shapes from

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519
many different sizes and shapes from
 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.550
many different sizes and shapes from
small phones to large tablets TVs and

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560
small phones to large tablets TVs and
 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.800
small phones to large tablets TVs and
beyond the great news is that Android

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810
beyond the great news is that Android
 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.510
beyond the great news is that Android
has been built from the ground up to

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520
has been built from the ground up to
 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.940
has been built from the ground up to
embrace this variety and give you tools

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950
embrace this variety and give you tools
 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.119
embrace this variety and give you tools
in order to deal with it so from the

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129
in order to deal with it so from the
 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.470
in order to deal with it so from the
very beginnings Android has allowed you

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480
very beginnings Android has allowed you
 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.750
very beginnings Android has allowed you
to scale your user interface up and down

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760
to scale your user interface up and down
 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.330
to scale your user interface up and down
between different devices the problem is

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340
between different devices the problem is
 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.069
between different devices the problem is
that scaling approaches will only get

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079
that scaling approaches will only get
 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.830
that scaling approaches will only get
you so far so I'm going to take you

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840
you so far so I'm going to take you
 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.900
you so far so I'm going to take you
through some of the common pitfalls we

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910
through some of the common pitfalls we
 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.970
through some of the common pitfalls we
see with this and relying on scaling

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980
see with this and relying on scaling
 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.500
see with this and relying on scaling
approaches and then I'm going to go

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510
approaches and then I'm going to go
 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.750
approaches and then I'm going to go
through some alternative ways of dealing

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760
through some alternative ways of dealing
 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.650
through some alternative ways of dealing
with this so the first problem we see

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660
with this so the first problem we see
 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.959
with this so the first problem we see
commonly is one of having an excessive

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969
commonly is one of having an excessive
 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.200
commonly is one of having an excessive
line lengths so in this application the

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210
line lengths so in this application the
 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.060
line lengths so in this application the
text and images are running the full

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070
text and images are running the full
 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.850
text and images are running the full
width of the devices screen on a smaller

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860
width of the devices screen on a smaller
 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.250
width of the devices screen on a smaller
phone size device this might be fine but

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260
phone size device this might be fine but
 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.590
phone size device this might be fine but
as you get beyond a certain size this

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600
as you get beyond a certain size this
 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.570
as you get beyond a certain size this
becomes uncomfortable when you

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580
becomes uncomfortable when you
 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.310
becomes uncomfortable when you
especially look when you're looking at

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320
especially look when you're looking at
 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.170
especially look when you're looking at
line lengths of text you want to be

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180
line lengths of text you want to be
 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.469
line lengths of text you want to be
aiming for between 45 and 75 characters

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479
aiming for between 45 and 75 characters
 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:25.789
aiming for between 45 and 75 characters
of text in order to maintain a

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799
of text in order to maintain a
 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.410
of text in order to maintain a
comfortable reading experience the user

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420
comfortable reading experience the user
 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.200
comfortable reading experience the user
can easily scan across it in this

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210
can easily scan across it in this
 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.370
can easily scan across it in this
application where you can see that this

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380
application where you can see that this
 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.120
application where you can see that this
is clearly exceeding that the next

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130
is clearly exceeding that the next
 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.010
is clearly exceeding that the next
problem we commonly see is one of

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020
problem we commonly see is one of
 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.710
problem we commonly see is one of
unbalanced content so in this example we

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720
unbalanced content so in this example we
 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:40.850
unbalanced content so in this example we
can see there's a lot of content

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860
can see there's a lot of content
 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.560
can see there's a lot of content
clustered up in the top left of the

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570
clustered up in the top left of the
 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.810
clustered up in the top left of the
screen and then leaving huge amounts of

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820
screen and then leaving huge amounts of
 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.580
screen and then leaving huge amounts of
whitespace across the rest of the screen

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590
whitespace across the rest of the screen
 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.160
whitespace across the rest of the screen
this leads to a very kind of unbalanced

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170
this leads to a very kind of unbalanced
 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.539
this leads to a very kind of unbalanced
feeling which makes your application

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549
feeling which makes your application
 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.490
feeling which makes your application
feel completely unoptimized for this

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500
feel completely unoptimized for this
 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.959
feel completely unoptimized for this
device and the last problem we commonly

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969
device and the last problem we commonly
 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.969
device and the last problem we commonly
see is more of a missed opportunity

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979
see is more of a missed opportunity
 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.209
see is more of a missed opportunity
almost of not making the best use of the

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219
almost of not making the best use of the
 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.550
almost of not making the best use of the
real-estate available to you so in this

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560
real-estate available to you so in this
 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.139
real-estate available to you so in this
example we might have an application

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149
example we might have an application
 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.660
example we might have an application
which shows many photos as we can see

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670
which shows many photos as we can see
 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.249
which shows many photos as we can see
that these tiny little thumbnails all

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259
that these tiny little thumbnails all
 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.210
that these tiny little thumbnails all
grouped over to one side

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220
grouped over to one side
 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.550
grouped over to one side
it really is a shame not to make the use

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560
it really is a shame not to make the use
 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.380
it really is a shame not to make the use
of these beautiful big screens and when

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390
of these beautiful big screens and when
 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:17.970
of these beautiful big screens and when
all this extra real estate when it is

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980
all this extra real estate when it is
 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.700
all this extra real estate when it is
available to you and so you want to be

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:20.710
available to you and so you want to be
 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:22.980
available to you and so you want to be
avoiding this so those are some of the

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990
avoiding this so those are some of the
 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.980
avoiding this so those are some of the
common pitfalls we see in relying on

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990
common pitfalls we see in relying on
 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.200
common pitfalls we see in relying on
scaling approaches and the answer to

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.210
scaling approaches and the answer to
 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:30.060
scaling approaches and the answer to
dealing with these problems really is to

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070
dealing with these problems really is to
 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.580
dealing with these problems really is to
adopt a responsive mobile design to

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590
adopt a responsive mobile design to
 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.230
adopt a responsive mobile design to
respond to the devices and

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.240
respond to the devices and
 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.960
respond to the devices and
characteristics so here are three

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970
characteristics so here are three
 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.730
characteristics so here are three
techniques you can use in order to do

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740
techniques you can use in order to do
 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:42.030
techniques you can use in order to do
this so the first technique is simply

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040
this so the first technique is simply
 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.160
this so the first technique is simply
one of combination this is if you have

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170
one of combination this is if you have
 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.320
one of combination this is if you have
an extra room combining things from

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330
an extra room combining things from
 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:47.940
an extra room combining things from
different screens into a single screen

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950
different screens into a single screen
 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.070
different screens into a single screen
in order to make up to fill up the space

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080
in order to make up to fill up the space
 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.680
in order to make up to fill up the space
so in this example we've got a typical

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690
so in this example we've got a typical
 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.199
so in this example we've got a typical
master detail view which on a phone

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209
master detail view which on a phone
 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.510
master detail view which on a phone
would be on two separate screens so

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:57.520
would be on two separate screens so
 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.040
would be on two separate screens so
clicking through from a list item for

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050
clicking through from a list item for
 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.220
clicking through from a list item for
example might show subsequent details on

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230
example might show subsequent details on
 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.720
example might show subsequent details on
the larger device with sufficient width

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730
the larger device with sufficient width
 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.000
the larger device with sufficient width
we might show both of these things at

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010
we might show both of these things at
 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.949
we might show both of these things at
once and this will avoid the problem

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959
once and this will avoid the problem
 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:09.720
once and this will avoid the problem
having those excessive line lengths and

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730
having those excessive line lengths and
 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.490
having those excessive line lengths and
make better use of the screen real

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500
make better use of the screen real
 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.250
make better use of the screen real
estate

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260
estate
 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.050
estate
the second technique is one the we call

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060
the second technique is one the we call
 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.630
the second technique is one the we call
macro reflow so this is taking the major

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640
macro reflow so this is taking the major
 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.310
macro reflow so this is taking the major
building blocks of your application and

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320
building blocks of your application and
 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.620
building blocks of your application and
reflowing them or rearranging them on

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630
reflowing them or rearranging them on
 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.030
reflowing them or rearranging them on
screen in order to make better use of

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040
screen in order to make better use of
 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.030
screen in order to make better use of
the space so in this example we simply

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040
the space so in this example we simply
 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.620
the space so in this example we simply
moved something like a large header

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630
moved something like a large header
 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.979
moved something like a large header
image and a body text instead of being

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989
image and a body text instead of being
 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:33.330
image and a body text instead of being
vertically stacked above each other to

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340
vertically stacked above each other to
 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.009
vertically stacked above each other to
be horizontally stacked next to each

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019
be horizontally stacked next to each
 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:37.050
be horizontally stacked next to each
other so we'll give the image more space

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060
other so we'll give the image more space
 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.270
other so we'll give the image more space
to kind of to show off on with the

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280
to kind of to show off on with the
 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.070
to kind of to show off on with the
larger amount of screen real estate as

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080
larger amount of screen real estate as
 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.960
larger amount of screen real estate as
well as avoiding those excessive line

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970
well as avoiding those excessive line
 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.539
well as avoiding those excessive line
lengths and when it's in a landscape

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:45.549
lengths and when it's in a landscape
 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:48.330
lengths and when it's in a landscape
device so this is not only useful for

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340
device so this is not only useful for
 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.520
device so this is not only useful for
different size devices you can also use

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530
different size devices you can also use
 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.229
different size devices you can also use
this kind of trick when changing on the

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239
this kind of trick when changing on the
 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:53.430
this kind of trick when changing on the
same device between different

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440
same device between different
 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.930
same device between different
orientations and the last technique I

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940
orientations and the last technique I
 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:59.340
orientations and the last technique I
want to go through is something we call

00:03:59.340 --> 00:03:59.350
want to go through is something we call
 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.250
want to go through is something we call
micro reflow and so this technique

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260
micro reflow and so this technique
 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.140
micro reflow and so this technique
really focuses on the individual blocks

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150
really focuses on the individual blocks
 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.750
really focuses on the individual blocks
within your design and it delegates

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760
within your design and it delegates
 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.370
within your design and it delegates
responsibilities to those individual

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:08.380
responsibilities to those individual
 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.199
responsibilities to those individual
blocks to optimize themselves given a

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209
blocks to optimize themselves given a
 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:12.509
blocks to optimize themselves given a
certain amount of space so a couple

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:12.519
certain amount of space so a couple
 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:14.970
certain amount of space so a couple
examples of doing that on there on the

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980
examples of doing that on there on the
 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.900
examples of doing that on there on the
left here we have a list type

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910
left here we have a list type
 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.120
left here we have a list type
application which given sufficient space

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130
application which given sufficient space
 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:22.500
application which given sufficient space
might lead to those excessive line

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510
might lead to those excessive line
 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.719
might lead to those excessive line
lengths or very unbalanced views so

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:24.729
lengths or very unbalanced views so
 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:25.830
lengths or very unbalanced views so
instead of that each in

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840
instead of that each in
 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.450
instead of that each in
vidual listitem knows that given a

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460
vidual listitem knows that given a
 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.040
vidual listitem knows that given a
certain amount of space how to draw

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050
certain amount of space how to draw
 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.100
certain amount of space how to draw
itself so once it gets over a certain

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110
itself so once it gets over a certain
 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:33.870
itself so once it gets over a certain
size or send them out of width available

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880
size or send them out of width available
 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.210
size or send them out of width available
to the device and it will change its

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220
to the device and it will change its
 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:37.680
to the device and it will change its
representation instead of being a list

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690
representation instead of being a list
 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:39.420
representation instead of being a list
item like change to say a grip grid

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430
item like change to say a grip grid
 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.939
item like change to say a grip grid
representation so this will allow you to

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:41.949
representation so this will allow you to
 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:43.969
representation so this will allow you to
have a you know fill the space better

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:43.979
have a you know fill the space better
 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:47.460
have a you know fill the space better
the second example is if you can't kind

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470
the second example is if you can't kind
 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.320
the second example is if you can't kind
of visit it is simply no way to

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.330
of visit it is simply no way to
 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.469
of visit it is simply no way to
introduce more content you can introduce

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:52.479
introduce more content you can introduce
 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:55.379
introduce more content you can introduce
a margin point instead so in this form

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:55.389
a margin point instead so in this form
 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:58.170
a margin point instead so in this form
type application on the right when we go

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180
type application on the right when we go
 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.060
type application on the right when we go
for beyond the phone past a certain size

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:00.070
for beyond the phone past a certain size
 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:01.620
for beyond the phone past a certain size
when there just isn't any more content

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:01.630
when there just isn't any more content
 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:03.690
when there just isn't any more content
we can show on screen we simply

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:03.700
we can show on screen we simply
 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:06.060
we can show on screen we simply
introduce a margin point so it doesn't

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:06.070
introduce a margin point so it doesn't
 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:07.710
introduce a margin point so it doesn't
end up being excessively long or

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:07.720
end up being excessively long or
 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:11.159
end up being excessively long or
excessively unbalanced so those are just

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:11.169
excessively unbalanced so those are just
 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:13.230
excessively unbalanced so those are just
a few techniques that you can employ in

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:13.240
a few techniques that you can employ in
 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.090
a few techniques that you can employ in
your design of your applications and

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:15.100
your design of your applications and
 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.190
your design of your applications and
over the rest of this series I'm going

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:17.200
over the rest of this series I'm going
 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.290
over the rest of this series I'm going
to go through some dev lights which

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.300
to go through some dev lights which
 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:20.340
to go through some dev lights which
you're going to teach developers out

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:20.350
you're going to teach developers out
 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:21.779
you're going to teach developers out
there how to actually build these

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:21.789
there how to actually build these
 

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:25.050
there how to actually build these
layouts thanks very much
