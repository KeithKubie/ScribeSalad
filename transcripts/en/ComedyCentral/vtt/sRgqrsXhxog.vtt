00:00:16.882 --> 00:00:18.251
- What the fuck is this?

00:00:18.284 --> 00:00:20.787
- Oh, well, sir, we have been
experiencing an uptick

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.955
in reports of employee
depression and aggression.

00:00:22.988 --> 00:00:24.657 size:81% position:41%
- So to address the issue,

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:26.759
we implemented Casual Friday,

00:00:26.792 --> 00:00:29.796 align:start position:0%
where employees
can wear jeans once a month.

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:32.832
- Well, that was
a catastrophic mistake.

00:00:32.865 --> 00:00:34.934
Just look at that.

00:00:34.967 --> 00:00:37.837
I mean, how can someone
lack the shame and dignity

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:39.839
to come into an office
looking like that?

00:00:39.872 --> 00:00:41.607
To put on those clothes

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.776
and stroll
into a place of business

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:45.378
and think that
that's an acceptable way

00:00:45.411 --> 00:00:46.779
to live your life?

00:00:46.812 --> 00:00:48.314 align:start position:0%
- We probably shouldn't tell him
our best lawyer

00:00:48.347 --> 00:00:50.183 align:start position:0%
went insane
and came in shirtless today.

00:00:50.216 --> 00:00:52.285 line:0%
- And what is going on
with those toes?

00:00:52.318 --> 00:00:54.754 line:0%
The second one is too long.
It should be covered.

00:00:54.787 --> 00:00:56.823
Why would he subject us to this?

00:00:56.856 --> 00:00:58.491
I don't want to see
another human being's foot

00:00:58.524 --> 00:01:00.226
for the rest of the day.

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:04.397
- Wow. This is definitely gonna
be a traumatic memory for me.

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.100
- Alyssa Armstrong is going to
be here within the hour,

00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:10.369
and she represents
Glorious Salvation Ministries,

00:01:10.402 --> 00:01:13.606
the largest group
of mega-churches in the country,

00:01:13.639 --> 00:01:15.608
and this meeting
was not easy to get.

00:01:15.641 --> 00:01:16.576
Oh, no, no, no, no.

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:18.978
I had to buy three

00:01:19.011 --> 00:01:21.447
of George W. Bush's
dog paintings

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:22.715
to get him to vouch for me.

00:01:22.748 --> 00:01:23.950 align:start position:0%
- [sobs]

00:01:23.983 --> 00:01:27.887
- Now, we all know
there's no God,

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.723
but there is...

00:01:30.756 --> 00:01:34.193
a ton of money
to be made in his name.

00:01:34.226 --> 00:01:36.863
So let's try to act
like professionals today.

00:01:36.896 --> 00:01:39.465 align:start position:0%
- [weeping]

00:01:39.498 --> 00:01:41.434
- And, John...

00:01:41.467 --> 00:01:42.502
put your glasses back on.

00:01:42.535 --> 00:01:45.571
You look like
a prepubescent Voldemort.

00:01:45.604 --> 00:01:46.737 align:start position:0%
- Thank you, sir.
