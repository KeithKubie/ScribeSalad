00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:16.060
I grew up in a family
of social scientists,

00:00:17.004 --> 00:00:19.535
but I was the weird child who drew.

00:00:20.108 --> 00:00:21.354
(Laughter)

00:00:21.796 --> 00:00:25.701
From making sketches of the models
in my mom's Sears catalog ...

00:00:27.187 --> 00:00:29.963
to a bedroom so full of my craft projects

00:00:29.987 --> 00:00:32.203
that it was like my own
personal art gallery,

00:00:33.164 --> 00:00:34.973
I lived to make.

00:00:36.909 --> 00:00:40.652
I don't think anyone in my family
was surprised when I became an architect.

00:00:41.844 --> 00:00:44.129
But to be honest with you,

00:00:44.153 --> 00:00:46.607
the real foundation
of the architect I became

00:00:46.631 --> 00:00:49.283
was not laid in that bedroom art gallery

00:00:49.307 --> 00:00:52.346
but by the conversations
around my family's dinner table.

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.927
There were stories of how people
lived and connected to one another,

00:00:57.951 --> 00:01:01.644
from the impact of urban migration
on a village in Zambia

00:01:01.668 --> 00:01:03.196
to the complex health care needs

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.470
of the homeless
in the streets of San Francisco.

00:01:06.574 --> 00:01:07.764
Now, it would be fair

00:01:07.788 --> 00:01:09.735
if you're looking over at your seatmate

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:13.709
and wondering, "What the hell
does that have to do with architecture?"

00:01:13.733 --> 00:01:17.272
Well, all of these stories involved space

00:01:18.497 --> 00:01:21.425
and how it did or didn't accommodate us.

00:01:23.134 --> 00:01:24.285
The fact is,

00:01:24.309 --> 00:01:26.235
we share some of our deepest connections

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:27.523
in physical space.

00:01:28.309 --> 00:01:29.712
And our stories play out,

00:01:29.736 --> 00:01:33.443
even in this crazy age
of texting and tweeting,

00:01:33.467 --> 00:01:34.730
in physical space.

00:01:36.201 --> 00:01:40.034
Unfortunately, architecture
hasn't done a great job

00:01:40.058 --> 00:01:42.740
of telling all of our stories equally.

00:01:43.491 --> 00:01:47.287
Too often, we see the building
of monuments like the Gherkin

00:01:47.311 --> 00:01:48.692
or even Trump Tower ...

00:01:48.716 --> 00:01:50.358
(Laughter)

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:54.257
that tell the story of the haves
rather than the have-nots.

00:01:55.245 --> 00:01:57.013
Throughout my career,

00:01:57.037 --> 00:01:58.708
I've actively resisted the practice

00:01:58.732 --> 00:02:01.657
of building monuments
to certain peoples' stories --

00:02:01.681 --> 00:02:05.023
usually white, male, rich --

00:02:05.047 --> 00:02:07.512
and bulldozing other peoples' stories --

00:02:07.536 --> 00:02:09.235
usually people of color

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:10.729
from low-income communities.

00:02:11.857 --> 00:02:13.334
I've tried to create a practice

00:02:13.358 --> 00:02:15.376
that is rooted in elevating the stories

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.196
of those who have
most often been silenced.

00:02:19.491 --> 00:02:20.641
That work --

00:02:21.453 --> 00:02:23.667
it's been a mission in spatial justice.

00:02:24.487 --> 00:02:30.458
(Applause)

00:02:30.482 --> 00:02:32.894
Now, spatial justice
means that we understand

00:02:32.918 --> 00:02:35.545
that justice has a geography,

00:02:36.977 --> 00:02:42.590
and that the equitable distribution
of resources, services and access

00:02:42.614 --> 00:02:44.113
is a basic human right.

00:02:45.426 --> 00:02:47.301
So what does spatial justice look like?

00:02:48.161 --> 00:02:50.316
Well, I'd like to share a story with you.

00:02:51.703 --> 00:02:53.007
For years,

00:02:53.031 --> 00:02:56.188
I've been working in the historically
African-American neighborhood

00:02:56.212 --> 00:02:58.296
of Bayview Hunters Point in San Francisco,

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.583
on a plot of land
that once held a power plant.

00:03:01.418 --> 00:03:02.645
Back in the '90s,

00:03:02.669 --> 00:03:05.739
a community group led by mothers
who lived in the public housing

00:03:05.763 --> 00:03:07.315
on the hill above the plant

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:08.668
fought for its closure.

00:03:09.111 --> 00:03:10.261
They won.

00:03:10.592 --> 00:03:13.335
The utility company finally tore it down,

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:14.707
cleaned the soil

00:03:14.731 --> 00:03:16.852
and capped most of the site with asphalt

00:03:16.876 --> 00:03:19.115
so that the clean soil wouldn't blow away.

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:20.956
Sounds like a success story, right?

00:03:22.231 --> 00:03:23.381
Well, not so fast.

00:03:24.342 --> 00:03:27.127
You see, because of various issues
like land entitlements,

00:03:27.151 --> 00:03:29.180
lease agreements, etc.,

00:03:29.204 --> 00:03:33.155
the land actually couldn't be redeveloped
for at least five to 10 years.

00:03:34.337 --> 00:03:37.507
What that meant is that this community

00:03:37.531 --> 00:03:40.793
that had been living
near a power plant for decades,

00:03:40.817 --> 00:03:46.642
now had 30 acres of asphalt
in their backyard.

00:03:47.711 --> 00:03:49.251
To put that in context for you,

00:03:49.275 --> 00:03:52.261
30 acres is equal
to about 30 football fields.

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:56.123
Now, the utility company
didn't want to be the bad guy here.

00:03:56.147 --> 00:03:58.415
Recognizing that they owed the community,

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:00.439
they actually put out a call for designers

00:04:00.463 --> 00:04:02.368
to propose temporary uses for this site,

00:04:02.392 --> 00:04:05.267
hoping to turn it into a community benefit

00:04:05.291 --> 00:04:06.652
rather than blight.

00:04:07.351 --> 00:04:11.140
I'm part of the diverse team of designers
that responded to that call,

00:04:11.164 --> 00:04:12.501
and for the last four years,

00:04:12.525 --> 00:04:14.525
we've been collaborating
with those mothers

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:15.700
and other residents,

00:04:15.724 --> 00:04:18.694
as well as local organizations
and the utility company.

00:04:19.394 --> 00:04:22.190
We've been experimenting
with all types of events

00:04:22.214 --> 00:04:24.730
to try and address issues
of spatial justice.

00:04:24.754 --> 00:04:27.883
Everything from job training workshops

00:04:27.907 --> 00:04:29.635
to an annual circus

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:31.958
to even a beautiful, new shoreline trail.

00:04:32.511 --> 00:04:34.979
In the four years
that we've been operational,

00:04:35.003 --> 00:04:38.964
over 12,000 people have come
and done something on this site

00:04:38.988 --> 00:04:42.422
that we hope has transformed
their relationship to it.

00:04:44.115 --> 00:04:45.628
But lately,

00:04:45.652 --> 00:04:49.218
I'm starting to realize
that events are not enough.

00:04:50.538 --> 00:04:51.688
A few months ago,

00:04:51.712 --> 00:04:54.277
there was a community meeting
in this neighborhood.

00:04:54.301 --> 00:04:57.366
The utility company was finally ready
to talk concretely

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:59.141
about long-term redevelopment.

00:05:00.028 --> 00:05:03.377
That meeting was kind of a disaster.

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.562
There was a lot of yelling and anger.

00:05:06.586 --> 00:05:08.166
People asked things like,

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:10.190
"If you're going
to sell it to a developer,

00:05:10.214 --> 00:05:13.126
wouldn't they just build
luxury condos like everyone else?"

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:14.921
And "Where has the city been?"

00:05:14.945 --> 00:05:17.965
"Why aren't there more jobs
and resources in this neighborhood?"

00:05:19.619 --> 00:05:22.762
It was not that our events
had failed to bring joy.

00:05:23.935 --> 00:05:26.714
But in spite of that,
there was still pain here.

00:05:27.995 --> 00:05:30.194
Pain from a history
of environmental injustice

00:05:30.218 --> 00:05:34.150
that left many industrial
uses in this neighborhood,

00:05:34.174 --> 00:05:36.305
leaving residents living near toxic waste

00:05:36.329 --> 00:05:37.832
and, literally, shit.

00:05:39.275 --> 00:05:40.562
There's pain from the fact

00:05:40.586 --> 00:05:45.288
that this zip code still has
one of the lowest per capita income,

00:05:45.312 --> 00:05:46.621
highest unemployment

00:05:46.645 --> 00:05:48.302
and highest incarceration rates

00:05:48.326 --> 00:05:52.751
in a city which tech giants
like Twitter, Airbnb and Uber call home.

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:55.507
And those tech companies --

00:05:55.531 --> 00:05:56.816
hm --

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.499
they've actually helped to trigger
a gentrification push

00:05:59.523 --> 00:06:01.620
that is rapidly redefining
this neighborhood,

00:06:01.644 --> 00:06:03.867
both in terms of identity and population.

00:06:05.299 --> 00:06:08.860
Now let me pause for a moment
to talk about gentrification.

00:06:10.578 --> 00:06:13.626
I suspect for a lot of us,
it's kind of like a dirty word.

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:17.471
It's become synonymous
with the displacement

00:06:17.495 --> 00:06:19.492
of poor residents from their neighborhood

00:06:19.516 --> 00:06:20.814
by wealthier newcomers.

00:06:21.355 --> 00:06:23.644
If you've ever been displaced,

00:06:23.668 --> 00:06:26.690
then you know the agony
of losing a place that held your story.

00:06:28.176 --> 00:06:30.740
And if you haven't experienced this,

00:06:30.764 --> 00:06:34.145
then I'm going to ask you to try
and imagine your way into it right now.

00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:38.532
Think about what it would be like
to find your favorite local spot,

00:06:38.556 --> 00:06:42.234
a place where you often went and hung out
with the old-timers or your friends,

00:06:43.486 --> 00:06:44.636
had vanished.

00:06:45.687 --> 00:06:46.838
And then you get home,

00:06:46.862 --> 00:06:48.812
and you find a letter
from your landlord,

00:06:48.836 --> 00:06:50.746
saying that your rent's been doubled.

00:06:51.734 --> 00:06:53.289
The choice to stay --

00:06:54.301 --> 00:06:55.535
it's not yours to make.

00:06:56.737 --> 00:06:58.543
You no longer belong in your home.

00:07:00.607 --> 00:07:04.686
And know that this feeling
you're feeling right now,

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:06.066
it would be the same

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:09.534
regardless of whether or not the person
who harmed you meant to do so.

00:07:12.019 --> 00:07:15.063
Developer Majora Carter once said to me,

00:07:15.087 --> 00:07:17.509
"Poor people don't hate gentrification.

00:07:17.533 --> 00:07:20.817
They just hate that they rarely get
to hang around long enough

00:07:20.841 --> 00:07:22.107
to enjoy its benefits."

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:29.277
Why is it that we treat culture erasure
and economic displacement as inevitable?

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:32.377
We could approach development

00:07:32.401 --> 00:07:35.019
with an acknowledgment
of past injustices --

00:07:35.043 --> 00:07:37.006
find value not only in those new stories

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:38.180
but the old ones, too.

00:07:39.145 --> 00:07:42.391
And make a commitment to build
people's capacity to stay --

00:07:43.681 --> 00:07:45.777
to stay in their homes,

00:07:45.801 --> 00:07:47.928
to stay in their communities,

00:07:47.952 --> 00:07:49.610
to stay where they feel whole.

00:07:52.297 --> 00:07:54.023
But to do this rethink,

00:07:54.047 --> 00:07:57.211
it requires looking
at those past injustices

00:07:57.235 --> 00:07:59.715
and the pain and grief
that is interwoven into them.

00:08:00.474 --> 00:08:03.252
And as I started to reflect
on my own work,

00:08:03.276 --> 00:08:06.003
I realized that pain and grief
have been recurring themes.

00:08:07.142 --> 00:08:09.771
I heard it early on
in the Bayview Hunters Point project

00:08:09.795 --> 00:08:11.676
when a man named Daryl said,

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:14.079
"We've always been
set aside like an island --

00:08:14.103 --> 00:08:15.358
a no-man's-land."

00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:18.233
I also heard it in Houston,

00:08:18.257 --> 00:08:20.591
when I was working on a project
with day laborers.

00:08:20.615 --> 00:08:23.868
And as Juan told me stories
of being robbed of his wages many times

00:08:23.892 --> 00:08:26.400
on the corner in which he stood every day

00:08:26.424 --> 00:08:28.995
to earn a living to support his family,

00:08:29.019 --> 00:08:30.170
he asked,

00:08:30.194 --> 00:08:32.924
"Why can't anyone see
the sacredness of this site?"

00:08:34.757 --> 00:08:37.400
You know, you've seen the pain, too.

00:08:38.604 --> 00:08:42.337
From campaigns around statue removals
in Charlottesville and New Orleans ...

00:08:43.796 --> 00:08:46.130
to towns that have lost
their industrial lifeblood

00:08:46.154 --> 00:08:47.328
and are now dying,

00:08:47.352 --> 00:08:49.707
like Lorain, Ohio and Bolton, England.

00:08:51.212 --> 00:08:54.554
We often rush to remake these places,

00:08:54.578 --> 00:08:56.788
thinking that we can ease their pain.

00:08:58.248 --> 00:09:01.180
But in our boundless desire to do good,

00:09:01.204 --> 00:09:02.791
to get past all of our mistakes,

00:09:02.815 --> 00:09:05.338
to build places that hold possibility,

00:09:06.849 --> 00:09:09.734
we often maintain a blissful ignorance

00:09:10.971 --> 00:09:15.866
of a landscape filled
with a very long trail of broken promises

00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:17.256
and squelched dreams.

00:09:18.634 --> 00:09:21.086
We are building on top of brokenness.

00:09:22.763 --> 00:09:25.588
Is it any wonder
that the foundations cannot hold?

00:09:27.411 --> 00:09:30.696
Holding space for pain and grief
was never part of my job description

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:32.250
as an architect --

00:09:32.274 --> 00:09:34.260
after all, it's not expedient,

00:09:34.284 --> 00:09:35.856
focused on beauty,

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:37.847
and hell, even requested by my clients.

00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:43.496
But I've seen what happens
when there's space for pain.

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:45.067
It can be transformational.

00:09:46.663 --> 00:09:48.179
Returning to our story,

00:09:48.203 --> 00:09:51.347
when we first started working
in the neighborhood,

00:09:51.371 --> 00:09:52.800
one of the first things we did

00:09:52.824 --> 00:09:56.612
was go out and interview the activists
who had led the fight to close the plant.

00:09:57.195 --> 00:10:00.742
We consistently heard and felt from them
a sense of impending loss.

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:03.347
The neighborhood was already changing,

00:10:03.371 --> 00:10:04.522
even back then.

00:10:04.546 --> 00:10:06.594
People were leaving or dying of old age,

00:10:06.618 --> 00:10:09.455
and with those departures,
stories were being lost.

00:10:10.397 --> 00:10:12.354
To those activists,

00:10:12.378 --> 00:10:14.793
no one was going to know
the amazing things

00:10:14.817 --> 00:10:16.970
that had happened in this community,

00:10:16.994 --> 00:10:19.373
because to everyone on the outside,

00:10:19.397 --> 00:10:20.547
it was the ghetto.

00:10:21.468 --> 00:10:22.953
At worst, a place of violence;

00:10:22.977 --> 00:10:25.389
at best, a blank slate.

00:10:26.682 --> 00:10:28.192
Neither was true, of course.

00:10:29.344 --> 00:10:32.421
So my colleagues and I,
we reached out to StoryCorps.

00:10:33.425 --> 00:10:34.576
And with their support,

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:36.136
and that of the utility company,

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:38.040
we built a listening booth on our site.

00:10:38.459 --> 00:10:40.228
And we invited the residents to come

00:10:40.252 --> 00:10:42.584
and have their stories
recorded for posterity.

00:10:43.515 --> 00:10:46.124
After a few days of recording,

00:10:46.148 --> 00:10:47.449
we held a listening party

00:10:48.695 --> 00:10:49.846
where we played clips,

00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:52.419
much like what you hear
on NPR every Friday morning.

00:10:53.625 --> 00:10:55.363
That party --

00:10:55.387 --> 00:10:57.773
it was one of the most amazing
community meetings

00:10:57.797 --> 00:10:59.171
I've ever been a part of.

00:10:59.925 --> 00:11:02.163
In part because we didn't
just talk about joy

00:11:03.238 --> 00:11:04.461
but also pain.

00:11:05.833 --> 00:11:07.635
Two stories that I remember well --

00:11:07.659 --> 00:11:10.756
AJ talked about what it was like
to grow up in the neighborhood.

00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:12.505
There was always a kid to play with.

00:11:13.023 --> 00:11:14.891
But he also spoke with sadness

00:11:14.915 --> 00:11:18.392
of what it was like to first be stopped
and questioned by a police officer

00:11:18.416 --> 00:11:19.566
when he was 11.

00:11:21.267 --> 00:11:23.596
GL also talked about the kids,

00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:27.396
and the ups and downs of the experience
of living in this neighborhood,

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:29.135
but he also spoke with pride

00:11:29.159 --> 00:11:31.603
of some of the organizations
that had sprung up

00:11:31.627 --> 00:11:33.992
to provide support and empowerment.

00:11:34.696 --> 00:11:36.156
He wanted to see more of that.

00:11:37.026 --> 00:11:40.867
By holding space
to first express pain and grief,

00:11:40.891 --> 00:11:43.915
we were then able
to brainstorm ideas for a site --

00:11:43.939 --> 00:11:48.700
amazing ideas that then became the seeds
of what we did over the next four years.

00:11:49.486 --> 00:11:51.544
So why the radically
different meeting now?

00:11:52.212 --> 00:11:53.362
Well ...

00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:57.337
the pain and grief woven into these spaces
was not created in a day.

00:11:58.164 --> 00:12:00.910
Healing also takes time.

00:12:02.328 --> 00:12:06.620
After all, who here thinks you can
go to therapy just once and be cured?

00:12:06.644 --> 00:12:08.016
(Laughter)

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:09.190
Anyone?

00:12:10.181 --> 00:12:11.352
I didn't think so.

00:12:12.135 --> 00:12:13.657
In retrospect,

00:12:13.681 --> 00:12:16.535
I wish that we had held
more listening sessions,

00:12:16.559 --> 00:12:18.030
not just joyful events.

00:12:19.645 --> 00:12:21.772
My work's taken me all over the world,

00:12:22.916 --> 00:12:27.337
and I have yet to set foot
in a place where pain didn't exist

00:12:27.361 --> 00:12:29.728
and the potential for healing was absent.

00:12:30.311 --> 00:12:33.677
So while I've spent my career
honing my skills as an architect,

00:12:33.701 --> 00:12:35.946
I realize that I'm now also a healer.

00:12:37.869 --> 00:12:41.109
I suppose this is the point in the talk
where I should be telling you

00:12:41.133 --> 00:12:42.468
those five steps to healing,

00:12:42.492 --> 00:12:44.181
but I don't have the solution --

00:12:44.205 --> 00:12:45.544
yet.

00:12:45.568 --> 00:12:46.718
Just a path.

00:12:47.772 --> 00:12:48.923
That being said,

00:12:48.947 --> 00:12:51.748
there are a few things
I have learned along the way.

00:12:51.772 --> 00:12:52.922
First --

00:12:53.418 --> 00:12:56.035
we cannot create cities for everyone

00:12:56.059 --> 00:12:58.693
unless we're first willing
to listen to everyone.

00:12:59.684 --> 00:13:02.351
Not just about what they hope
to see built in the future

00:13:02.375 --> 00:13:05.255
but also about what has been
lost or unfulfilled.

00:13:06.771 --> 00:13:07.921
Second --

00:13:08.357 --> 00:13:10.906
healing is not just for "those people."

00:13:11.969 --> 00:13:14.186
For those of us with privilege,

00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:17.833
we have to have a reckoning
with our own guilt,

00:13:17.857 --> 00:13:20.319
discomfort and complicity.

00:13:21.574 --> 00:13:24.074
As non-profit leader
Anne Marks once observed,

00:13:24.098 --> 00:13:26.301
"Hurt people hurt people;

00:13:26.325 --> 00:13:28.669
healed people heal people."

00:13:30.424 --> 00:13:31.574
And third --

00:13:32.611 --> 00:13:34.802
healing is not about the erasure of pain.

00:13:35.822 --> 00:13:39.292
We often have a tendency to want
to put a clean slate over our pain,

00:13:39.316 --> 00:13:42.194
much like that asphalt on the soil
in Bayview Hunters Point.

00:13:42.602 --> 00:13:44.193
But it doesn't work that way.

00:13:44.768 --> 00:13:47.448
Healing is about acknowledging pain

00:13:47.472 --> 00:13:48.721
and making peace with it.

00:13:50.484 --> 00:13:54.725
One of my favorite quotes
says that healing renews our faith

00:13:54.749 --> 00:13:56.489
in the process of becoming.

00:13:57.996 --> 00:14:00.254
I stand here before you
as an architect-healer

00:14:00.278 --> 00:14:02.998
because I'm ready to see
what I can become,

00:14:03.022 --> 00:14:05.649
what my community and those
that I work with can become,

00:14:05.673 --> 00:14:06.824
and what this country,

00:14:06.848 --> 00:14:09.075
and frankly, this world can become.

00:14:09.099 --> 00:14:11.466
And I was not meant
to take that journey alone.

00:14:13.202 --> 00:14:17.738
I believe that many of you are unhappy
with the way that things are now.

00:14:19.202 --> 00:14:21.382
Believe that it can be different.

00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:27.027
I believe that you all are
far more resilient than you think.

00:14:28.419 --> 00:14:31.069
But the first step requires courage.

00:14:32.343 --> 00:14:34.648
The courage to see each other's pain,

00:14:35.787 --> 00:14:38.713
and to be willing
to stay in the presence of it,

00:14:38.737 --> 00:14:40.477
even when it gets uncomfortable.

00:14:41.737 --> 00:14:45.427
Just imagine the change
that we can make together

00:14:46.428 --> 00:14:48.387
if we all committed to that.

00:14:49.323 --> 00:14:50.474
Thank you.

00:14:50.498 --> 00:14:57.467
(Applause)
