00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.730
 . 

00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:03.550
 Let's say I have a triangle. 

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:05.900
 Here is my triangle. 

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.550
 And I know only the lengths of the sides of the triangle. 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.490
 This side has length "a", this side has length "b", and 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:14.360
 this country has a length of "c". 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.480
 And I'm told to find the face of this triangle. 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.870
 So far, everything I have is the idea that the person, 

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:26.930
 the face of a triangle is equal to 1/2 on the base of the triangle 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.380
 triangle, at the height of the triangle. 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.570
 The way I have drawn this triangle, the basis of this 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.060
 triangle, will be a "c" side, but we do not know the height. 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.900
 The height will be that "h" right there and we 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.750
 we do not even know how much this "h" is. 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.200
 So, it will be "h". 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.360
 The question is how to diminish the face 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.660
 of this triangle? 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.150
 If you have watched the last video, you know that 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:52.440
 use the formula of Heron. 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.910
 But the idea here is to try to prove the Heron formula. 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.530
 So, let's just try to find "h" just using the 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:00.970
 Pythagorean theorem. 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.190
 And from there, once we know h, we can apply this formula 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.100
 to find the face of this triangle. 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.370
 We have already noted this as "h". 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.120
 Let's define another variable here. 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.880
 Let me determine ... 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.270
 This is a trick that you will see quite often in geometry. 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:24.990
 Let us define this as "x" and if it is "x" in purple, then in 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.990
 this blue-violet color, it will be "c" minus "x", right? 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.710
 This whole length is "c" - the whole base is "c". 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.560
 So if this part is "x", then this part is "c" minus "x". 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.060
 What I can do now, as these both are right angles 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.250
 and I know this because this is the height, I can do two 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.600
 equations with the Pythagorean theorem. 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.890
 First, I can do this on the left side and I can write that 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:57.880
 "x" of square plus "h" of square is equal to "a" square. 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.690
 That's what I get from this triangle on the left. 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.000
 Then from this triangle on the right side, I get "c" minus "x" 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:14.030
 the square plus "h" of the square is equal to the "b" square. 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.760
 I assume I know "a", "b" and "c", so I have two equations 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:18.950
 with two unknowns. 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.290
 The unknowns are "x" and "h". 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.220
 And do not forget that "h" is what we are trying to find, 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.270
 because we already know "c". 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.540
 If we know h, we can apply the formula to the person. 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:28.900
 How can we do that? 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.200
 Okay, let's replace "h" to find "x". 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.360
 When I say this, I mean to find "h" in a square here. 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.890
 If we find "h" in a square here, just subtract "x" 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.320
 squares on both sides. 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.540
 We can write that "x" of a square - sorry, we can write that 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:51.720
 "h" per square is equal to "a" square minus "x" square. 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.770
 Then we can take that information and replace it 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.640
 here "h" per square. 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:02.030
 So, this inferior equation turns into "c" minus "x" 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.990
 a square plus "h" per square. 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:08.610
 We know "h" on a square of this arrangement on the left. 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.620
 "h" of square will be equal to - and so plus, I'll do it 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:19.160
 in this color - "a" of square minus "x" per square is equal to "b" per square. 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.650
 I just replaced the value of this here, 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.280
 the value of that there. 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.860
 Now let's expand this expression. 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.750
 "with" minus "x" per square, this is "c" per square minus 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:34.320
 "2cx" plus "x" per square. 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.200
 Then we have a minus - excuse, we have plus "a" 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:44.280
 square, minus "x" square is equal to "b" square, 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.660
 is equal to the "b" square. 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.060
 We have "x" of the square and "a" minus "x" of a square there, 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:51.610
 so these are canceled. 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.680
 These are canceled 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.790
 Let's add "2cx" to both sides of this equation. 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.930
 Now our equation will become a "c" square 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.720
 plus "a" square. 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.490
 I add "2cx" to both sides. 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:10.440
 Add "2cx" to this, you get 0 is equal to 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.580
 "b" square plus "2cx". 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.370
 All I did here is that I canceled "x" on a square and then 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.600
 I added "2cx" to both sides of this equation. 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.130
 My goal here is to find "x". 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:24.580
 Once I find "x", I can find "h" 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.350
 to apply this formula. 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:29.090
 Now, to find "x", let's take a "b" into a square 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:30.040
 from both sides. 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:36.200
 We get the "c" square plus "a" square, minus "b" 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:41.020
 the square is equal to "2cx". 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:46.160
 Then, if we divide both sides to "2c", we get a "c" square plus "a" 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:52.600
 square minus "b" square on "2c" is equal to "x". 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.880
 We just found "x" here. 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.290
 Now, our goal is to find the height, so yes 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:59.930
 we can apply 1/2 at the base, height. 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:04.120
 To do this, you return to this equation here 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.040
 and we find our height. 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.800
 Let me roll a little down. 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:16.290
 We know that our square height is equal to "a" 

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:20.520
 square minus "x" square. 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.330
 Instead of writing an "x" square, let's replace it here. 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:27.430
 This is a minus "x" per square - x is this thing here. 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:32.880
 So, "with" the square plus "a" of the square, minus "b" of the square 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.670
 on "2c" per square. 

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:39.320
 This is the same thing as the square x. 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.090
 We have just found this. 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:47.950
 So, "h" will be equal to the square root of all this 

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:51.610
 work there - will change the colors - to "a" 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:06:00.070
 square minus "c" square, plus "a" square, minus "b" square 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:02.150
 - all in a square. 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:04.800
 Let me do it a little nicer than that because 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.720
 I do not want to -... 

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:13.980
 Square root - make sure that I have enough space - from "a" 

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:20.130
 square minus all of these things on a square - we have a "c" square 

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:25.800
 plus "a" square, minus "b" square, all on "2c". 

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.670
 This is the height of our triangle. 

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:30.310
 The triangle we started up here. 

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:33.360
 Let me copy this, just to remember, 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:36.070
 with what we have to do. 

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:41.600
 Copy it and then put it down here. 

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:43.300
 I put it down here. 

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:45.210
 We know how tall it is - it's great 

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:46.830
 complex formula. 

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:51.180
 The height, in terms of "a", "b" and "c" is right here. 

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:54.570
 So if we want to find the face - our face 

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:58.270
 triangle - let's do it in pink. 

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:03.772
 The face of our triangle will be 1/2 on our foundation 

00:07:03.772 --> 00:07:09.850
 - our base is the whole length "c" - "c", ours 

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:13.260
 height, which is the expression here. 

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.680
 Let's just copy it instead of .... 

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:21.390
 Let me copy it. 

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:24.450
 And so on the height. 

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:27.910
 So, this is now our expression for the person. 

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:29.810
 Now you will say - Watch it, it does not look very much 

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:32.790
 of the Heron formula and you are right. 

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:35.360
 This is not much like the Heron formula, but what it is 

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:37.820
 I'll show you in the next video is that this essentially 

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:39.230
 is the Heron formula. 

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:43.050
 This is a harder-to-remember version of Heron's formula. 

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:46.000
 I'll put a lot of the algebra to make it simple 

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.260
 this to the Heron formula. 

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.430
 But that will do the job. 

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:51.520
 If you could remember that, I think Heron's a lot 

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.050
 easier to remember. 

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:56.300
 But if you can remember this and you know "a", "b" and 

00:07:56.300 --> 00:08:00.700
 "c", apply this formula here and you will get it 

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:04.940
 the face of a triangle. 

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:07.290
 Actually, let me put this down just to show that 

00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:09.710
 at least gives the same numbers as the Heroes. 

00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:15.920
 In the last video we had a triangle that had sides 9, 11 

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:22.350
 and 16, and his face, using the Genoa formula, was equal to 18 

00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:26.290
 square root of 7. 

00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:29.780
 Let's see what we get when we apply this formula here. 

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:36.260
 We get that person equal to 1/2 at 16, by 

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:40.300
 square root of "a" per square. 

00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:49.330
 This is 81 minus - let's see, "c" of a square is 16, so that's 256. 

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:58.020
 256 plus "a" square, which is 81, minus "b" square, 

00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:02.250
 so minus 121. 

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:04.120
 All this is a square. 

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:09.530
 All this on 2 by "c" - all on 32. 

00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:12.150
 Let's see if we can simplify this a bit. 

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:15.770
 81 minus 121, it's minus 40. 

00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:18.790
 So, this becomes 216 on 32. 

00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:22.470
 The area is equal to 1/2 by 8 is 8. 

00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:24.530
 Let me change the colors. 

00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:38.820
 1/2 by 16 is 8, by square root of 81 minus 256. 

00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:41.370
 81 minus 121, it's minus 40. 

00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:43.370
 256 minus 40 is 216. 

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:48.270
 216 on 32 per square. 

00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:50.630
 Now, it's a lot of math, so let's do it 

00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:51.870
 takes a calculator. 

00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:54.140
 I'm just really trying to show you these two numbers 

00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:57.440
 must give us the same as our number. 

00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:01.290
 If we run our calculator ... 

00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:02.440
 First, let's find out how old it is 

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:03.420
 square root of 7. 

00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:07.590
 18 by square root of 7 - that's what 

00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:08.580
 we get using the Heron formula. 

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:11.100
 Obtained 47.62. 

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:13.160
 Let's see if this is 47.62. 

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:26.700
 We have 8 by square root of 81 minus 216 divided 

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:35.140
 32 square meters and then close our square root. 

00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:37.990
 And we get exactly the same number. 

00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:39.890
 I was worried - I did not actually calculate that 

00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:41.580
 in advance, so I may have made a mistake of inattention. 

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:43.310
 But here you are getting exactly the same number. 

00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:47.170
 So, our formula now gave us exactly the same value 

00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:48.350
 as the Heron formula. 

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:54.030
 But what I will do in the next video is to prove you that 

00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:57.690
 this can actually be reduced algebraically to the Heron formula. 

00:10:57.690 --> 00:10:58.990
 .
