00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.040
And I think 2 of these answers here are true.

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.670
First of all, if you had perfect formal criteria for malware,

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.740
the whole thing would fall under Rice's Theorem.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.570
Malware would be a functional property

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.100
and we know that functional properties are not decidable,

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.790
which in turn means that since the problem is undecidable

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:18.270
that malware detection can never be perfect.

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.230
It's not really clear what kind of error you will be making,

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.410
so if you will be classifying good software as bad

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:26.980
or bad software as good,

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.110
but it can not be perfect,

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.150
because if it were perfect, then that would violate Rice's Theorem.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.690
Now NP completeness of course; that is not true for several reasons,

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.080
so first of all, running time is

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.890
something something that we just can see here,

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:41.600
and secondly, as you've learned,

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.200
there are problems that are much worse than problems that lie in NP

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.080
so it can also be that malware detection is actually

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.130
worse than NP complete.

00:00:49.130 --> 99:59:59.000
We just don't know, so this is not a correct answer here.
