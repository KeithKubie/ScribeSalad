00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
I just got the feedback from
the one minute things just a few

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.225
minutes
before class,

00:00:06.225 --> 00:00:10.500
so I think I may defer
commenting on the couple of them

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.125
until the beginning of next
lecture.

00:00:13.125 --> 00:00:15.750
But there are a couple of
things

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.579
that I think I can say.

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:21.000
One is, several people were
wondering, how

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.416
does the cell decide whether to
do mitosis or meiosis?

00:00:25.416 --> 00:00:28.643
But the
mitosis, which is ordinary cell

00:00:28.643 --> 00:00:31.500
division is what happens
everywhere

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.858
in your body,
in your intestine,

00:00:33.858 --> 00:00:35.760
on your skin,
in your eye,

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.897
anywhere
except, since thats how you

00:00:38.897 --> 00:00:42.000
make all the different cells you
have.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.253
The meiosis,
which creates the sex sells,

00:00:44.253 --> 00:00:46.833
or gametes, happens in a very
specific place,

00:00:46.833 --> 00:00:50.000
either in the testes if you are
male or the ovary if you

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.825
are a female.

00:00:50.825 --> 00:00:54.000
So, there's a dedicated place
where meiosis takes

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.696
place, and just your knowledge
of human anatomy and physiology

00:00:57.696 --> 00:01:00.142
can
make a pretty good guess as to

00:01:00.142 --> 00:01:01.142
where that is.

00:01:01.142 --> 00:01:03.759
Everywhere
else, it's mitosis.

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:07.000
There's a very special place
where

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.164
that happens.

00:01:08.164 --> 00:01:13.000
A couple of you still got
confused when I was talking

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.885
about meiosis and I was showing
you a progression through,

00:01:17.885 --> 00:01:20.875
and I put a
double headed arrow,

00:01:20.875 --> 00:01:25.000
meaning that's what that period
was called.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.727
The process is unidirectional.

00:01:27.727 --> 00:01:29.909
It only goes in one way.

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.826
It's not a
reversible process.

00:01:32.826 --> 00:01:36.384
There were some questions about
the

00:01:36.384 --> 00:01:40.198
chiasmata or the chiasma:
why is there a crossover in

00:01:40.198 --> 00:01:42.968
chiasma in
meiosis but not mitosis?

00:01:42.968 --> 00:01:45.920
I will tell you about that
today very

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:46.831
specifically.

00:01:46.831 --> 00:01:50.690
Why was there a tall and a
short pair of chromosomes?

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.003
That was arbitrary.

00:01:52.003 --> 00:01:55.459
I made up a simple cell for us
to consider these

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:57.475
properties in,
one with a long,

00:01:57.475 --> 00:01:59.826
and what with a short,
nothing else.

00:01:59.826 --> 00:02:03.035
I
wasn't trying to represent any

00:02:03.035 --> 00:02:05.000
particular organism.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.004
And I'll pick up on a couple of
other things.

00:02:08.004 --> 00:02:10.807
I just want to
quickly mention something.

00:02:10.807 --> 00:02:13.331
Since I've seen you,
I flew out to San

00:02:13.331 --> 00:02:16.652
Diego, gave a talk yesterday
morning at a major meeting,

00:02:16.652 --> 00:02:19.188
hopped on a
plane, got back at midnight,

00:02:19.188 --> 00:02:20.396
and here I am again.

00:02:20.396 --> 00:02:23.053
As part of being a
scientist, come teacher,

00:02:23.053 --> 00:02:25.831
at a place like MIT,
you guys tend not to see,

00:02:25.831 --> 00:02:30.000
but my research life goes on
while I'm teaching.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.813
And I just want to briefly
mention one thing I talked about

00:02:32.813 --> 00:02:35.058
yesterday,
because just in my own life it

00:02:35.058 --> 00:02:38.356
captures a couple of things that
I've been trying to tell you,

00:02:38.356 --> 00:02:40.331
that the textbook is not the
ultimate

00:02:40.331 --> 00:02:40.846
authority.

00:02:40.846 --> 00:02:42.902
That's just what we think up
until today.

00:02:42.902 --> 00:02:45.143
A new finding
to change the way you think

00:02:45.143 --> 00:02:47.220
about things,
and what I'm telling you,

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.114
and some of your frustrated at,
that I'm not just parroting

00:02:50.114 --> 00:02:52.167
back the
textbook is because this is the

00:02:52.167 --> 00:02:52.652
way it is.

00:02:52.652 --> 00:02:55.272
If you guys are going to be
leaders in whatever field

00:02:55.272 --> 00:02:57.554
you're in, you're going to be
dealing with this

00:02:57.554 --> 00:03:01.000
process of shifting sands as we
gain new knowledge.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.578
So, in fact what I was talking
about has some relationship to

00:03:04.578 --> 00:03:06.981
the cell
cycle that I talked about.

00:03:06.981 --> 00:03:09.467
Lee Hartwell particularly
helped us

00:03:09.467 --> 00:03:12.564
understand that there is what's
called a G1 phase,

00:03:12.564 --> 00:03:15.508
which you could
think of as a preparation for

00:03:15.508 --> 00:03:17.937
DNA synthesis for what's known
as the

00:03:17.937 --> 00:03:20.616
S-phase where DNA synthesis
actually occurs.

00:03:20.616 --> 00:03:22.174
And now, you're at 4N.

00:03:22.174 --> 00:03:25.813
You've doubled the DNA content,
and there's G2 where it cleans

00:03:25.813 --> 00:03:27.744
up from
S-phase, gets ready for

00:03:27.744 --> 00:03:30.645
mitosis, and mitosis is when
you, then, separate

00:03:30.645 --> 00:03:33.328
the daughter chromatids,
go back to 2N,

00:03:33.328 --> 00:03:36.227
and then ultimately
the cell divides.

00:03:36.227 --> 00:03:37.968
And we are back to 2N.

00:03:37.968 --> 00:03:40.440
And when we
were talking about DNA

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.229
replication, I told you how
replicative DNA

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:45.684
polymerases test for
Watson-Crick shape,

00:03:45.684 --> 00:03:49.266
and remember that little
movie I showed you where they

00:03:49.266 --> 00:03:51.538
flipped the base pair into a
very

00:03:51.538 --> 00:03:55.029
narrow slot in the protein,
and they check that it's there.

00:03:55.029 --> 00:03:56.807
And they
said at that time,

00:03:56.807 --> 00:03:59.846
that's why polymerases have a
problem when they

00:03:59.846 --> 00:04:03.260
hit a lesion such as a thymine
dimer that we get if we go out

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:04.000
in the sun.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.287
And then one of the recent
pieces of excitement in the DNA

00:04:07.287 --> 00:04:09.042
repair field
that I work in,

00:04:09.042 --> 00:04:12.306
was the discovery of a whole
class of translesion DNA

00:04:12.306 --> 00:04:15.393
polymerases that have very
flexible, active sites and we

00:04:15.393 --> 00:04:17.267
are able to copy
over a lesion.

00:04:17.267 --> 00:04:20.210
Right at this point,
you will find in the literature

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:22.088
all
sorts of reviews about

00:04:22.088 --> 00:04:24.767
polymerase switching,
where people are

00:04:24.767 --> 00:04:28.130
envisioning the replicative
polymerase coming along.

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:30.420
It hits a
lesion, gets stuck.

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:33.416
It recruits one of these
translesion

00:04:33.416 --> 00:04:36.527
polymerases that comes in,
copies of the lesion;

00:04:36.527 --> 00:04:39.858
it switches back to the
replicative polymerase,

00:04:39.858 --> 00:04:41.049
and then it goes.

00:04:41.049 --> 00:04:44.600
And there are reviews like
that coming out in the

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:45.359
literature.

00:04:45.359 --> 00:04:47.915
So, one of the genes that's
needed

00:04:47.915 --> 00:04:51.943
for this sort of error prone
kind of translesion synthesis in

00:04:51.943 --> 00:04:54.743
yeast and
in humans is a gene called

00:04:54.743 --> 00:04:55.281
rev-1?.

00:04:55.281 --> 00:04:58.497
You don't have to know this
for the exam,

00:04:58.497 --> 00:04:59.130
this bit.

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.875
But if you knock out the
function of

00:05:01.875 --> 00:05:04.635
that gene, the yeast aren't
mutated by UV or chemicals

00:05:04.635 --> 00:05:05.052
anymore.

00:05:05.052 --> 00:05:07.100
So, you
know it has an essential

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:09.375
function somehow in this process
of

00:05:09.375 --> 00:05:10.570
translesion synthesis.

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:13.125
So, one of our big surprises
was I was trying

00:05:13.125 --> 00:05:13.288
it.

00:05:13.288 --> 00:05:16.875
We were trying to actually fish
out partners that might interact

00:05:16.875 --> 00:05:19.304
with it cause we thought it
would be regulated.

00:05:19.304 --> 00:05:20.625
And we were surprised.

00:05:20.625 --> 00:05:23.547
The experiments revealed
something we hadn't expected.

00:05:23.547 --> 00:05:25.852
We found out
that this protein that was

00:05:25.852 --> 00:05:28.125
critical for mutagenesis was
extremely

00:05:28.125 --> 00:05:30.339
strongly cell cycle regulated.

00:05:30.339 --> 00:05:32.923
Well, given the reviews I've
told

00:05:32.923 --> 00:05:37.074
you, or if somebody were
writing a textbook today,

00:05:37.074 --> 00:05:40.004
this is what they
would tell you:

00:05:40.004 --> 00:05:42.885
polymerase switching during
S-phase.

00:05:42.885 --> 00:05:47.389
So you might have
thought it would be high and

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:49.569
S-phase, but it isn't.

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:52.381
We can
barely detect it during

00:05:52.381 --> 00:05:53.049
S-phase.

00:05:53.049 --> 00:05:56.307
But instead,
the rev-1 levels are at

00:05:56.307 --> 00:05:58.895
least 50 times in the G2M
phase.

00:05:58.895 --> 00:06:02.153
Actually, it goes right through
this

00:06:02.153 --> 00:06:07.056
part of the cell cycle,
50 times what they are during

00:06:07.056 --> 00:06:08.000
S-phase.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.187
And so, there's a couple of
possibilities right now.

00:06:11.187 --> 00:06:13.340
Either
these very tiny amounts that

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:15.500
are doing S-phase are what
everybody

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.522
thinks and current models would
predict: you're getting

00:06:18.522 --> 00:06:19.801
polymerase
switching.

00:06:19.801 --> 00:06:23.000
And it makes 50 fold more
during this phase for something

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:23.267
else.

00:06:23.267 --> 00:06:24.982
If so, I don't know what that
is.

00:06:24.982 --> 00:06:28.326
The other possibility is that
we have to rethink our model,

00:06:28.326 --> 00:06:30.500
and that it isn't polymerase
switching

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:31.649
during replication.

00:06:31.649 --> 00:06:34.250
Actually, the replication fork
just keeps

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:38.000
moving, and it leaves behind
little messes.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.223
And when the cell is busy
starting to line up chromosomes,

00:06:41.223 --> 00:06:43.769
and even
while it's pulling them apart,

00:06:43.769 --> 00:06:47.105
that's when this translesion
synthesis stuff comes in,

00:06:47.105 --> 00:06:48.689
and it cleans up the damage.

00:06:48.689 --> 00:06:51.140
Now, I don't
know what the right answer is.

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:53.384
That was one of the things I
was talking

00:06:53.384 --> 00:06:54.684
about yesterday morning.

00:06:54.684 --> 00:06:57.230
But it's an example of how
something that you

00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:01.076
guys can now hopefully at least
understand in principle is being

00:07:01.076 --> 00:07:02.383
debated right now.

00:07:02.383 --> 00:07:05.071
And the finding from my lab
changed

00:07:05.071 --> 00:07:07.729
the way I'd been thinking about
it at least.

00:07:07.729 --> 00:07:10.553
I can now see another
very real possibility.

00:07:10.553 --> 00:07:13.355
So, just to move on,
so we are going back to

00:07:13.355 --> 00:07:16.583
Mendel now, who did an awful
lot more than I told you.

00:07:16.583 --> 00:07:18.739
A few of you
thought it was pretty

00:07:18.739 --> 00:07:20.633
frustrating and it had all that.

00:07:20.633 --> 00:07:22.815
But Mendel was
doing other things.

00:07:22.815 --> 00:07:24.856
You already know what he could
do.

00:07:24.856 --> 00:07:26.704
He knew how
to do crosses.

00:07:26.704 --> 00:07:28.086
He knew how to count.

00:07:28.086 --> 00:07:29.927
And he could think,
which

00:07:29.927 --> 00:07:31.796
was really important.

00:07:31.796 --> 00:07:35.000
And he's saw ratios instead of
just

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:35.695
numbers.

00:07:35.695 --> 00:07:40.478
So it was another class of
experiments that he could do,

00:07:40.478 --> 00:07:43.399
and
that was he could do a cross

00:07:43.399 --> 00:07:47.000
where he looked at more than one
trait at

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:47.428
once.

00:07:47.428 --> 00:07:52.485
And he didn't have all that
many options for things he could

00:07:52.485 --> 00:07:55.625
do,
but he did what are known as

00:07:55.625 --> 00:07:59.000
dihybrid crosses,
where he followed

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.139
two traits at once.

00:08:01.139 --> 00:08:05.307
And I showed you some of the
traits

00:08:05.307 --> 00:08:06.910
that he studied.

00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:11.920
In fact, that picture I showed
you is actually a

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:15.475
cross that we can think of
right now.

00:08:15.475 --> 00:08:18.536
He's got smooth,
and yellow,

00:08:18.536 --> 00:08:23.727
wrinkled, and green,
and yellow, and you'll see them

00:08:23.727 --> 00:08:26.380
in all four
combinations.

00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:31.767
So, an example of the kind of
cross that Mendel carried

00:08:31.767 --> 00:08:38.384
out, then, was he took smooth
yellow, which actually is the

00:08:38.384 --> 00:08:43.025
dominant allele,
and both, which he learned from

00:08:43.025 --> 00:08:45.000
his other crosses.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:51.284
And he crossed it with wrinkled
green, which I'll represent as a

00:08:51.284 --> 00:08:54.746
little s, little s,
little y, little y,

00:08:54.746 --> 00:09:00.766
where he previously knew the
little s and little y alleles,

00:09:00.766 --> 00:09:06.314
the wrinkled and green were
the recessive alleles.

00:09:06.314 --> 00:09:11.906
And then, the F1 generation,
wouldn't be surprising to you

00:09:11.906 --> 00:09:14.998
at this point,
I think, that they were

00:09:14.998 --> 00:09:16.466
all smooth, yellow.

00:09:16.466 --> 00:09:18.399
And, they all were Ss Yy.

00:09:18.399 --> 00:09:22.465
And if you think about
the possible gametes you get

00:09:22.465 --> 00:09:25.666
out of this, you could only get
a big S,

00:09:25.666 --> 00:09:28.677
big Y out of this one,
and little s,

00:09:28.677 --> 00:09:31.000
little y out of that one.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:37.770
So if they came together,
it would have to be that.

00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:42.461
So then, he
self-crossed the F1,

00:09:42.461 --> 00:09:48.331
and what he got out of that was
the kind

00:09:48.331 --> 00:09:57.000
of mixture of things that he
saw there.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.391
He saw smooth yellow,
smooth green,

00:10:01.391 --> 00:10:06.427
wrinkled yellow,
and wrinkled green.

00:10:06.427 --> 00:10:15.855
In doing the same kind of
experiments that we talked about

00:10:15.855 --> 00:10:22.892
before, he counted them,
he looked to see if he saw

00:10:22.892 --> 00:10:26.398
characteristic
ratios.

00:10:26.398 --> 00:10:27.511
He did.

00:10:27.511 --> 00:10:32.441
The ratios he saw were 9:3:3:1.

00:10:32.441 --> 00:10:36.399
So,
I think we know how his head

00:10:36.399 --> 00:10:38.532
worked at this point.

00:10:38.532 --> 00:10:43.742
He tried to figure
out if he could explain these

00:10:43.742 --> 00:10:47.775
results by the kind of model
that he

00:10:47.775 --> 00:10:53.189
was developing where hereditary
information came in,

00:10:53.189 --> 00:10:54.888
in particles.

00:10:54.888 --> 00:10:56.569
And he could.

00:10:56.569 --> 00:11:02.000
But he had to make a critical
assumption.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:08.426
And if you've just seen the
next square I'm going to draw,

00:11:08.426 --> 00:11:12.108
without
realizing the assumption

00:11:12.108 --> 00:11:17.110
underlies it,
then you've missed a great deal

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:18.887
of his thinking.

00:11:18.887 --> 00:11:24.666
And that was that the two genes
assort, or the two

00:11:24.666 --> 00:11:30.402
traits anyway,
because he didn't know they

00:11:30.402 --> 00:11:34.733
were genes
yet, independently.

00:11:34.733 --> 00:11:39.625
And the way we could see that
would

00:11:39.625 --> 00:11:45.683
be to think about what were the
kind of gametes that you could

00:11:45.683 --> 00:11:47.910
make from
those F1s.

00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:52.674
So, we could get a big S and a
big Y from here,

00:11:52.674 --> 00:11:56.032
or a big S
and a little y,

00:11:56.032 --> 00:12:01.375
or a little s and a big Y,
or a little s

00:12:01.375 --> 00:12:03.632
and a little y.

00:12:03.632 --> 00:12:08.750
And, since this is selfing,
it's

00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:10.404
the same thing.

00:12:10.404 --> 00:12:16.250
So I won't fill this whole
thing in, but we get two

00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:18.712
S's, two big Y's here.

00:12:18.712 --> 00:12:23.750
Down here we'd have little s,
little y like

00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:24.263
that.

00:12:24.263 --> 00:12:29.503
I'll fill in a couple up here
where we've got big S,

00:12:29.503 --> 00:12:33.267
big S, big Y,
and a little Y.

00:12:33.267 --> 00:12:38.110
Here we have big S,
big S, but two

00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:39.102
little Y's.

00:12:39.102 --> 00:12:43.250
Here we'd have big S,
little s, big Y little y.

00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:46.147
And over
here we'd have big S,

00:12:46.147 --> 00:12:48.308
little S, two little y's.

00:12:48.308 --> 00:12:53.308
So, if you were to make
out a table or a chart like

00:12:53.308 --> 00:12:59.553
this that showed the phenotypes,
you'll find that all of these

00:12:59.553 --> 00:13:03.000
look wild type,
we can see it here.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.619
However, this one would be
smooth.

00:13:05.619 --> 00:13:07.921
But it's got the two alleles.

00:13:07.921 --> 00:13:09.843
So it
would be green.

00:13:09.843 --> 00:13:12.661
This one would be smooth and
yellow.

00:13:12.661 --> 00:13:16.395
And this, again,
would be smooth but green.

00:13:16.395 --> 00:13:19.908
And down on the corner it is
the wrinkled

00:13:19.908 --> 00:13:20.398
green.

00:13:20.398 --> 00:13:24.727
And if you follow that out,
draw out the rest of that,

00:13:24.727 --> 00:13:27.579
you'll
discover there the 9:3:3:1

00:13:27.579 --> 00:13:28.127
ratios.

00:13:28.127 --> 00:13:31.181
That was what Mendel observed
in all

00:13:31.181 --> 00:13:33.126
of his experiments.

00:13:33.126 --> 00:13:36.916
But he wasn't particularly
bothered

00:13:36.916 --> 00:13:41.289
by it because he'd shown
particulate information.

00:13:41.289 --> 00:13:44.935
The fact they
assorted randomly wasn't an

00:13:44.935 --> 00:13:45.421
issue.

00:13:45.421 --> 00:13:48.581
However, that was before people
knew

00:13:48.581 --> 00:13:53.089
about the chromosomes,
which we spent quite a bit of

00:13:53.089 --> 00:13:56.182
time talking
about the other day.

00:13:56.182 --> 00:14:00.249
As I said, when people saw
those chromosomes

00:14:00.249 --> 00:14:06.082
that gave rise to what's known
as the chromosomal theory

00:14:06.082 --> 00:14:07.768
of inheritance.

00:14:07.768 --> 00:14:12.822
And what was interesting about
chromosomal theory of

00:14:12.822 --> 00:14:16.089
inheritance was that it
predicted a different

00:14:16.089 --> 00:14:20.290
outcome depending on whether
the traits you were studying

00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:22.852
were
encoded by genes on the same

00:14:22.852 --> 00:14:25.543
chromosome or by genes on
different

00:14:25.543 --> 00:14:26.343
chromosomes.

00:14:26.343 --> 00:14:29.672
Now, as it happened,
what I think Mendel did was he

00:14:29.672 --> 00:14:33.070
found
traits that were well behaved

00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:35.000
and he could study.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:40.404
And those all happened to be on
separate chromosomes.

00:14:40.404 --> 00:14:43.985
So, his
results didn't disclose this

00:14:43.985 --> 00:14:47.888
issue that was raised by the
discovery of

00:14:47.888 --> 00:14:49.008
chromosomes.

00:14:49.008 --> 00:14:53.024
The chromosomal theory of
inheritance gives,

00:14:53.024 --> 00:14:57.050
as I said,
predicts different outcomes

00:14:57.050 --> 00:15:00.777
depending whether things are on
the

00:15:00.777 --> 00:15:04.089
same or different chromosomes.

00:15:04.089 --> 00:15:08.284
So let's consider that by
taking the

00:15:08.284 --> 00:15:08.663
F1.

00:15:08.663 --> 00:15:13.704
So, say they are on separate
chromosomes.

00:15:13.704 --> 00:15:20.236
And let's take the F1
from the previous cross over

00:15:20.236 --> 00:15:20.840
here.

00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:25.427
So, big S., little s,
big Y, little

00:15:25.427 --> 00:15:34.000
y, and then we'll cross it with
the homozygous recessive parent.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.834
That was a cross that I
mentioned the first lecture was

00:15:37.834 --> 00:15:38.998
very
important.

00:15:38.998 --> 00:15:42.663
It's important enough that it's
given a special name.

00:15:42.663 --> 00:15:44.397
It's called a test across.

00:15:44.397 --> 00:15:46.464
Well, here we are using it
here.

00:15:46.464 --> 00:15:48.803
Well
what are the possible outcomes

00:15:48.803 --> 00:15:51.331
that could come from this sort
of thing?

00:15:51.331 --> 00:15:55.219
Well, I think the way you could
think about it most easily is,

00:15:55.219 --> 00:15:57.913
what
kind of gametes or sex cells

00:15:57.913 --> 00:16:00.000
could we get out of this?

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.208
Well, from here we could get a
big S and a big Y.

00:16:04.208 --> 00:16:06.577
Or, we could get a big
S.

00:16:06.577 --> 00:16:10.133
and the little y,
a little S and a big Y,

00:16:10.133 --> 00:16:12.982
or a little S and a little
y.

00:16:12.982 --> 00:16:17.554
So, we could get four different
types of sex cells.

00:16:17.554 --> 00:16:21.661
The gametes we
can get out of this side,

00:16:21.661 --> 00:16:23.827
there's only one type.

00:16:23.827 --> 00:16:27.225
So, if we start
combining those,

00:16:27.225 --> 00:16:32.000
I think you can see what the
outcome would be.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.449
It's so simple.

00:16:33.449 --> 00:16:37.410
We don't even need to draw out
the square.

00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:40.404
If we had
big S, big Y over,

00:16:40.404 --> 00:16:43.206
they're all going to be over.

00:16:43.206 --> 00:16:45.331
Well actually,
I'll

00:16:45.331 --> 00:16:50.886
draw up this way because I
think it's a little easier to

00:16:50.886 --> 00:16:51.291
see.

00:16:51.291 --> 00:16:55.162
So,
there would be four possible

00:16:55.162 --> 00:17:00.512
things that would come out of
this test cross.

00:17:00.512 --> 00:17:04.900
This would be the smooth and
yellow.

00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:08.766
Here would be,
what have I done wrong here?

00:17:08.766 --> 00:17:10.700
No, this is right.

00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:13.344
This should be smooth and
green.

00:17:13.344 --> 00:17:16.500
This would be wrinkled and
yellow.

00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:19.814
And this would be wrinkled and
green.

00:17:19.814 --> 00:17:23.491
And, do you see what the
ratio would be?

00:17:23.491 --> 00:17:28.098
It would be 1:1:1:1 because we
have an equal probability

00:17:28.098 --> 00:17:30.402
of making any of those.

00:17:30.402 --> 00:17:33.909
And, I'm going to rearrange
these

00:17:33.909 --> 00:17:38.006
because that way that it'll
help us think about it,

00:17:38.006 --> 00:17:42.363
this is one of the
types that we've found in the

00:17:42.363 --> 00:17:43.726
original cross.

00:17:43.726 --> 00:17:48.101
That's a parental
phenotype, smooth and yellow.

00:17:48.101 --> 00:17:51.363
It was one of the parents up
there.

00:17:51.363 --> 00:17:56.225
This is the other one that
looks like one of the original

00:17:56.225 --> 00:17:57.181
parents.

00:17:57.181 --> 00:18:01.799
So, I can divide these into
parental or nonparental

00:18:01.799 --> 00:18:03.000
phenotypes.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.053
These are 1:1,
and then these others were ones

00:18:07.053 --> 00:18:11.358
where the progeny differed
from the parent.

00:18:11.358 --> 00:18:13.898
And they're all 1:1:1:1.

00:18:13.898 --> 00:18:18.519
Now, that's what the
chromosomal theory of

00:18:18.519 --> 00:18:22.998
inheritance would predict if
they were on

00:18:22.998 --> 00:18:25.454
separate chromosomes.

00:18:25.454 --> 00:18:29.665
That's what Mendel saw when he
was

00:18:29.665 --> 00:18:32.543
doing his crosses.

00:18:32.543 --> 00:18:39.046
What if they were on the same
chromosome?

00:18:39.046 --> 00:18:46.500
So, we are going to have to go
back to the original

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:50.875
cross now to think this one
through.

00:18:50.875 --> 00:18:55.500
So, what Mendel started with
was a

00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:58.344
smooth, yellow parent.

00:18:58.344 --> 00:19:00.543
So that was SYSY.

00:19:00.543 --> 00:19:05.417
But because these
are on the same chromosome,

00:19:05.417 --> 00:19:09.000
I'm going to depict them this
way so we

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.416
can see they're going to travel
as a unit.

00:19:12.416 --> 00:19:16.652
So that was then crossed with
the wrinkled green,

00:19:16.652 --> 00:19:21.000
which would be a little s,
little y in each case.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.250
This should be F1.

00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:28.679
In this case they will be all
smooth and yellow.

00:19:28.679 --> 00:19:32.133
The recessive traits disappear,
but

00:19:32.133 --> 00:19:33.597
this time they're only.

00:19:33.597 --> 00:19:36.398
What the progeny will have,
they will have

00:19:36.398 --> 00:19:39.242
gotten one of the possible
alleles from this one,

00:19:39.242 --> 00:19:42.086
which would be the SY
on the same chromosome,

00:19:42.086 --> 00:19:44.931
and one from the other parent,
the little s,

00:19:44.931 --> 00:19:48.637
little y again on the same
chromosome and one from the

00:19:48.637 --> 00:19:50.866
other
parent, the little s and y,

00:19:50.866 --> 00:19:52.721
again, on the same chromosome.

00:19:52.721 --> 00:19:54.499
So now if
you start to ask,

00:19:54.499 --> 00:19:57.730
what will happen if I do a test
cross, you're going

00:19:57.730 --> 00:19:59.477
to get a different outcome.

00:19:59.477 --> 00:20:02.000
So here's the test cross in
this case.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.555
So, we've got this F1.

00:20:03.555 --> 00:20:07.089
It's smooth and yellow,
but it's actually at the

00:20:07.089 --> 00:20:08.689
chromosomal level now.

00:20:08.689 --> 00:20:12.180
It's like this,
and we're crossing it with the

00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:16.251
homozygous recessive parent
that's now going to look like

00:20:16.251 --> 00:20:16.615
that.

00:20:16.615 --> 00:20:18.658
So if
you think through,

00:20:18.658 --> 00:20:22.362
what kind of gametes could we
get out of this?

00:20:22.362 --> 00:20:25.635
Well, there's only two
possibilities.

00:20:25.635 --> 00:20:29.399
We could get this
one or this one.

00:20:29.399 --> 00:20:33.777
And over here,
the kind of gametes

00:20:33.777 --> 00:20:37.399
we could get,
there's only one type.

00:20:37.399 --> 00:20:41.332
So, what are we going to get
out of

00:20:41.332 --> 00:20:42.610
this cross?

00:20:42.610 --> 00:20:48.886
What we'll end up getting is
big SY, over the little

00:20:48.886 --> 00:20:54.118
sy, or little sy over the
little sy like that.

00:20:54.118 --> 00:21:00.443
That's smooth and
yellow, wrinkled and green,

00:21:00.443 --> 00:21:04.000
the ratio of these 1:1.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.019
But you see the difference from
what we saw before?

00:21:06.019 --> 00:21:20.000
These are the
parental phenotypes.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.903
The chromosomal theory of
inheritance doesn't predict that

00:21:23.903 --> 00:21:26.300
you
will get, or it predicts that

00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:29.382
you will not get the nonparental
phenotypes.

00:21:29.382 --> 00:21:32.944
So, if you wanted to
distinguish between these two

00:21:32.944 --> 00:21:36.233
hypotheses, and figure out
where your genes were,

00:21:36.233 --> 00:21:37.959
you'd do the
experiment.

00:21:37.959 --> 00:21:41.577
And what happened when this was
done, again, what often

00:21:41.577 --> 00:21:44.166
happens in science,
you think you've got it

00:21:44.166 --> 00:21:45.214
straightened out.

00:21:45.214 --> 00:21:47.691
You got
hypothesis A and hypothesis B,

00:21:47.691 --> 00:21:50.209
and you do experiment planning
to do the

00:21:50.209 --> 00:21:52.007
scientific method and show it.

00:21:52.007 --> 00:21:54.525
And you get a result that isn't
what you

00:21:54.525 --> 00:21:56.435
expected with either model.

00:21:56.435 --> 00:21:58.840
And that's in fact what
happened

00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:00.124
in this case.

00:22:00.124 --> 00:22:04.721
And it led to the discovery of
genetic recombination.

00:22:04.721 --> 00:22:07.855
And to show you actually the
experiments where

00:22:07.855 --> 00:22:11.426
that was discovered,
I'm going to switch to another

00:22:11.426 --> 00:22:13.492
widely used
genetic model,

00:22:13.492 --> 00:22:16.236
which is the Drosophila
melanogaster,

00:22:16.236 --> 00:22:19.113
or the
fruit fly, which you see in the

00:22:19.113 --> 00:22:21.024
summer around rotting fruit.

00:22:21.024 --> 00:22:23.654
Or if
you're in the biology building,

00:22:23.654 --> 00:22:26.142
one is apt to land on your
sandwich

00:22:26.142 --> 00:22:30.712
because there's just a few
stragglers that get out of the

00:22:30.712 --> 00:22:32.595
Drosophila genetics labs.

00:22:32.595 --> 00:22:35.307
But the one thing you can see
from

00:22:35.307 --> 00:22:37.274
this is the eyes,
pretty cool.

00:22:37.274 --> 00:22:38.156
It's got red.

00:22:38.156 --> 00:22:41.635
The wild type is a red
eye, and the body's brown.

00:22:41.635 --> 00:22:43.613
And, you can see the red eyes.

00:22:43.613 --> 00:22:46.138
If you look
at a fruit fly carefully,

00:22:46.138 --> 00:22:49.152
you'll be able to see,
the summer if you take

00:22:49.152 --> 00:22:52.003
a look, you'll see that they
have red eyes.

00:22:52.003 --> 00:22:55.370
So, they've been a very
useful model organism for

00:22:55.370 --> 00:22:58.384
genetics partly because they
grow pretty fast

00:22:58.384 --> 00:23:03.000
and they are easy to handle in
a lab.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:08.810
And so, I'll introduce you to a
couple of features.

00:23:08.810 --> 00:23:13.576
So, the wild
type you find in nature is a

00:23:13.576 --> 00:23:14.763
brown body.

00:23:14.763 --> 00:23:18.109
We'll call it a plus,
and it

00:23:18.109 --> 00:23:22.958
has normal wings,
and which I'll refer to as

00:23:22.958 --> 00:23:23.522
plus.

00:23:23.522 --> 00:23:28.709
And some mutant
phenotypes that geneticists

00:23:28.709 --> 00:23:33.221
have been able to find is a
black body

00:23:33.221 --> 00:23:36.504
which I'll refer to as little
b.

00:23:36.504 --> 00:23:40.000
And vestigial wings,
which I'll

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.475
refer to as VG.

00:23:41.475 --> 00:23:44.819
So, these are fairly easy to
score.

00:23:44.819 --> 00:23:47.943
They look
like little tiny wings.

00:23:47.943 --> 00:23:52.000
It's fairly easy if you're
crossing Drosophila,

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:56.451
and looking at progeny to go
through and score,

00:23:56.451 --> 00:23:59.099
what color are
their eyes?

00:23:59.099 --> 00:24:04.000
And do they have ordinary wings
or little wings?

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.505
So, this is the kind of cross
that was carried out.

00:24:07.505 --> 00:24:10.935
We are going to
switch now to an organism that

00:24:10.935 --> 00:24:12.380
has male and female.

00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:14.674
Up until now,
plants are both.

00:24:14.674 --> 00:24:18.305
They make pollen,
and they have the eggs that are

00:24:18.305 --> 00:24:21.898
going to develop into the seeds
once they're fertilized.

00:24:21.898 --> 00:24:24.303
But, Drosophila
are more like us.

00:24:24.303 --> 00:24:26.544
They come in males and females.

00:24:26.544 --> 00:24:29.633
So, we're going
to have to specify which is

00:24:29.633 --> 00:24:30.031
which.

00:24:30.031 --> 00:24:32.615
And I think most of you are
probably

00:24:32.615 --> 00:24:34.896
familiar with this terminology.

00:24:34.896 --> 00:24:37.545
This is the symbol geneticists
use

00:24:37.545 --> 00:24:38.380
for female.

00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:41.495
And this is the one that is
used for male.

00:24:41.495 --> 00:24:44.816
So, in this
case, let's set up exactly the

00:24:44.816 --> 00:24:47.724
same kind of thing that we start
here.

00:24:47.724 --> 00:24:51.166
We're going to cross a
homozygous parent versus a

00:24:51.166 --> 00:24:53.347
homozygous recessive
parent.

00:24:53.347 --> 00:24:57.375
That's just exactly the kind of
thing we have up here.

00:24:57.375 --> 00:25:00.245
But
I'm going to do at this time

00:25:00.245 --> 00:25:03.000
using Drosophila genetics speak.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:07.991
And so, we'll be taking female
whose wild type for both traits,

00:25:07.991 --> 00:25:10.925
we're
going to cross with a male

00:25:10.925 --> 00:25:14.271
that's homozygous recessive for
both

00:25:14.271 --> 00:25:14.835
traits.

00:25:14.835 --> 00:25:19.263
This is the way Drosophila
geneticists tend to represent

00:25:19.263 --> 00:25:21.051
this
kind of thing.

00:25:21.051 --> 00:25:25.544
So it's exactly the same kind
of cross we got before.

00:25:25.544 --> 00:25:29.747
And at this point,
what we get out of the F1,

00:25:29.747 --> 00:25:32.875
it shouldn't
be news for you.

00:25:32.875 --> 00:25:36.583
You can see genetically what
it's

00:25:36.583 --> 00:25:37.522
going to be.

00:25:37.522 --> 00:25:41.749
They'll have to get one allele
from here, one allele

00:25:41.749 --> 00:25:42.572
from there.

00:25:42.572 --> 00:25:46.091
So, by definition,
the only possibility that you

00:25:46.091 --> 00:25:47.868
can get
out of this,

00:25:47.868 --> 00:25:51.206
the F1s, will all have one
allele dominant,

00:25:51.206 --> 00:25:54.221
and one
recessive allele just like up

00:25:54.221 --> 00:25:54.664
there.

00:25:54.664 --> 00:25:57.248
And this will be,
since the wild

00:25:57.248 --> 00:26:02.415
type is the dominant allele,
this will be brown and normal,

00:26:02.415 --> 00:26:04.614
and normal wings.

00:26:04.614 --> 00:26:09.142
And then, at this point they
then

00:26:09.142 --> 00:26:14.786
will set up a test cross,
exactly the same idea.

00:26:14.786 --> 00:26:18.306
We're going to take
the F1.

00:26:18.306 --> 00:26:24.081
And in this case,
we'll take a female whose got

00:26:24.081 --> 00:26:30.300
this, and
we'll cross her with a male who

00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:34.000
is homozygous recessive.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:40.166
So that will be black over
black, and vestigial over

00:26:40.166 --> 00:26:41.375
vestigial.

00:26:41.375 --> 00:26:43.788
And
out of this,

00:26:43.788 --> 00:26:47.572
there are four possibilities.

00:26:47.572 --> 00:26:51.682
We can get parental
phenotypes.

00:26:51.682 --> 00:26:56.188
So, there will be,
from that, black over,

00:26:56.188 --> 00:27:01.979
if you look to the
various combinations of how

00:27:01.979 --> 00:27:06.887
these things could go together,
you'll

00:27:06.887 --> 00:27:09.683
find we can get vestigial plus.

00:27:09.683 --> 00:27:13.111
Or, we can get black over
black, and

00:27:13.111 --> 00:27:14.686
vestigial over vestigial.

00:27:14.686 --> 00:27:17.333
For example,
this one, coming from those

00:27:17.333 --> 00:27:20.392
two getting together,
and this one coming from this

00:27:20.392 --> 00:27:22.565
one and this one
getting together.

00:27:22.565 --> 00:27:25.777
So this is just exactly the
same kind of thing we've

00:27:25.777 --> 00:27:30.000
done but done using Drosophila
traits.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.769
And then, nonparental,
so now we get,

00:27:34.769 --> 00:27:39.142
for example,
black over black,

00:27:39.142 --> 00:27:45.109
and vestigial over plus,
black but normal wings,

00:27:45.109 --> 00:27:51.549
or we could have black
over plus, vestigial over

00:27:51.549 --> 00:27:57.426
vestigial, which would be a
brown body, but

00:27:57.426 --> 00:28:00.112
with vestigial wings.

00:28:00.112 --> 00:28:04.461
So, if we were trying to do
this

00:28:04.461 --> 00:28:07.242
kind of cross,
we are doing this kind of

00:28:07.242 --> 00:28:11.885
cross, and we are trying to
see what the outcome would be.

00:28:11.885 --> 00:28:16.549
Mendel, every trait assorts
independently would predict the

00:28:16.549 --> 00:28:17.128
1:1:1:1.

00:28:17.128 --> 00:28:21.255
And the chromosomal theory
of inheritance would predict

00:28:21.255 --> 00:28:24.152
we'd get 1:1 here,
and we wouldn't see

00:28:24.152 --> 00:28:25.184
those at all.

00:28:25.184 --> 00:28:29.076
Instead, what happened when
this experiment was

00:28:29.076 --> 00:28:34.000
done where numbers that didn't
really fit.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.515
This part works pretty well.

00:28:36.515 --> 00:28:40.199
These are numbers from an
experiment of

00:28:40.199 --> 00:28:41.138
this type.

00:28:41.138 --> 00:28:44.144
So these are pretty close to
1:1.

00:28:44.144 --> 00:28:45.083
That's OK.

00:28:45.083 --> 00:28:48.653
That fits
with both of the models.

00:28:48.653 --> 00:28:52.598
The surprise is over here where
there is

00:28:52.598 --> 00:28:53.616
206 to 185.

00:28:53.616 --> 00:28:56.948
So, these are in the ballpark
of 1:1.

00:28:56.948 --> 00:29:01.953
But what you can
see is the result is not what

00:29:01.953 --> 00:29:05.000
was predicted by the model.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.067
This is the kind of thing I've
sort of been trying to tell you

00:29:08.067 --> 00:29:09.164
through
the course.

00:29:09.164 --> 00:29:10.787
It keeps happening in biology.

00:29:10.787 --> 00:29:13.870
It's not a QED sort of
thing where you can work it out

00:29:13.870 --> 00:29:14.372
by logic.

00:29:14.372 --> 00:29:17.227
Very often, you do an
experiment, you get a result

00:29:17.227 --> 00:29:19.284
that doesn't fit within your
current

00:29:19.284 --> 00:29:19.817
framework.

00:29:19.817 --> 00:29:22.536
And then you have to go back
and redo your thinking.

00:29:22.536 --> 00:29:23.981
So
what was going on here,

00:29:23.981 --> 00:29:26.085
as it turned out,
and it all got sorted out,

00:29:26.085 --> 00:29:28.449
was
scientists had just discovered

00:29:28.449 --> 00:29:30.000
genetic recombination.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:36.024
And here is where,
what was going on.

00:29:36.024 --> 00:29:46.399
So when we talked about Meiosis
I, and we had duplicated the

00:29:46.399 --> 00:29:53.428
DNA, so we now had two
chromatids, and I

00:29:53.428 --> 00:30:05.142
showed you the chiasma when it
was drying, it looked sort

00:30:05.142 --> 00:30:07.412
of like this.

00:30:07.412 --> 00:30:15.000
And, I said that you always saw
these physical attachments that

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.784
once the homologous pairs were
duplicated, they would always

00:30:18.784 --> 00:30:19.646
be in contact.

00:30:19.646 --> 00:30:22.850
And I said there was
actually a physical interaction

00:30:22.850 --> 00:30:23.746
going on there.

00:30:23.746 --> 00:30:26.671
Well what was going
on in there was an exchange,

00:30:26.671 --> 00:30:29.000
a recombination event at the
DNA level

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:32.314
that's just exactly equivalent
to what was happening when I

00:30:32.314 --> 00:30:34.643
showed you
the phage cross.

00:30:34.643 --> 00:30:38.443
Remember, we had a phage cross,
and

00:30:38.443 --> 00:30:43.364
if we got a recombination in
between the two genes,

00:30:43.364 --> 00:30:48.416
then we could get
progeny that were a mixture of

00:30:48.416 --> 00:30:49.958
the two traits.

00:30:49.958 --> 00:30:53.966
So, if we were plus
plus, for example,

00:30:53.966 --> 00:30:57.071
these are on the same
chromosome.

00:30:57.071 --> 00:31:00.799
And the other one
is like this,

00:31:00.799 --> 00:31:06.000
black, vestigial,
black, and vestigial.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.736
If we get a genetic
recombination going on here

00:31:09.736 --> 00:31:13.076
where these two
intersect and recombine in

00:31:13.076 --> 00:31:16.398
between these two genes,
what you get out of

00:31:16.398 --> 00:31:19.993
that, then, is this chromatid
is still the same.

00:31:19.993 --> 00:31:22.578
It's got both wild
type alleles.

00:31:22.578 --> 00:31:26.196
But in this case,
now, the black allele has moved

00:31:26.196 --> 00:31:29.711
from
here to the tip of this one,

00:31:29.711 --> 00:31:32.000
pairing it with that.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:36.570
And the other chromatid over
here, the other homologous pair,

00:31:36.570 --> 00:31:39.341
now has
the plus together with the

00:31:39.341 --> 00:31:41.582
vestigial here and then here.

00:31:41.582 --> 00:31:44.692
So, if you,
then, draw out the possible

00:31:44.692 --> 00:31:47.471
gametes one will look like one
parent.

00:31:47.471 --> 00:31:50.095
One
will look like the other

00:31:50.095 --> 00:31:50.707
parent.

00:31:50.707 --> 00:31:55.836
This one can give rise to a
nonparental phenotype in a test

00:31:55.836 --> 00:31:56.321
cross.

00:31:56.321 --> 00:32:02.511
And that one can give rise
to a nonparental phenotype in a

00:32:02.511 --> 00:32:04.000
test cross.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:10.214
And that's what's going on in
this experiment I've described.

00:32:10.214 --> 00:32:14.171
But the
nice thing about this since

00:32:14.171 --> 00:32:18.500
this sort of thing is happening
is one

00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:22.969
can calculate,
then, a recombination frequency

00:32:22.969 --> 00:32:30.130
in just the same way that
we calculated it when we were

00:32:30.130 --> 00:32:33.000
doing phage cross.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:38.765
And in this case,
it was the recombinants,

00:32:38.765 --> 00:32:44.608
which in this context
I'm referring to the

00:32:44.608 --> 00:32:50.347
nonparentals,
the recombinants over the total

00:32:50.347 --> 00:32:57.000
of
the parental types and the

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:00.000
nonparental.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:04.302
So in this case,
this would be 206 plus 185 over

00:33:04.302 --> 00:33:07.414
965 plus 944 plus 206
plus 185.

00:33:07.414 --> 00:33:13.000
And if I haven't blown the
arithmetic, that would be a

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.920
recombination frequency of 17%.

00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:19.500
Now, we were back talking about
that

00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:20.647
phage cross.

00:33:20.647 --> 00:33:26.000
Remember, we did a pair of
crosses between gene one and

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:31.075
two, and between two and three,
and then we were trying to

00:33:31.075 --> 00:33:36.045
figure out if
they were in the linear order,

00:33:36.045 --> 00:33:39.000
how we could explain it.

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:43.575
And we finally worked out the
order by crossing allele one and

00:33:43.575 --> 00:33:44.250
three.

00:33:44.250 --> 00:33:48.750
And we made a little genetic
map that could show the order of

00:33:48.750 --> 00:33:51.825
gene 1,
2, and 3, based on nothing more

00:33:51.825 --> 00:33:54.224
than the recombination
frequency.

00:33:54.224 --> 00:33:57.042
So,
that's exactly what people were

00:33:57.042 --> 00:34:00.000
able to do by this kind of
measurement.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:03.263
And that, then,
led to the generation of

00:34:03.263 --> 00:34:04.602
chromosome maps.

00:34:04.602 --> 00:34:07.660
This
is a publication from Science

00:34:07.660 --> 00:34:08.319
in 1994.

00:34:08.319 --> 00:34:11.862
This is before the human
genome was done.

00:34:11.862 --> 00:34:15.815
And they were mapping a kind of
genetic marker

00:34:15.815 --> 00:34:19.847
that we'll talk about when we
do restriction enzymes.

00:34:19.847 --> 00:34:23.401
But they were
able to associate it with

00:34:23.401 --> 00:34:28.271
banding patterns they had seen
on the chromosome.

00:34:28.271 --> 00:34:32.920
This is the sort of thing that
cytologists saw,

00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:36.998
and as scientists were working
this out, then they

00:34:36.998 --> 00:34:40.529
were able to associate these
genetic maps of loci,

00:34:40.529 --> 00:34:44.831
and begin to associate
them with the physical maps of

00:34:44.831 --> 00:34:47.664
banding patterns in chromosomes.

00:34:47.664 --> 00:34:51.115
Now we have the sort of
ultimate genetic map,

00:34:51.115 --> 00:34:54.850
which is the sequence
of the human chromosomes.

00:34:54.850 --> 00:34:57.813
So now we know exactly,
to the base pair,

00:34:57.813 --> 00:35:00.368
how
far different genes are.

00:35:00.368 --> 00:35:04.681
Part of the way that the human
genome was assembled from all

00:35:04.681 --> 00:35:07.000
these little tiny fragments of
DNA that

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:10.166
were sequenced were taking
advantage of these kind of maps

00:35:10.166 --> 00:35:12.937
that told the
scientists assembling all these

00:35:12.937 --> 00:35:16.633
little fragments of DNA sequence
what order they had to be in,

00:35:16.633 --> 00:35:19.000
what part of the chromosome
they were on,

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:20.393
and that kind of thing.

00:35:20.393 --> 00:35:22.212
There is, this,
then, leads us,

00:35:22.212 --> 00:35:24.542
though, to
other issues since I've now

00:35:24.542 --> 00:35:26.428
started to talk about
chromosomes.

00:35:26.428 --> 00:35:29.250
And one
more thing, let me just say

00:35:29.250 --> 00:35:31.000
before I leave this.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:36.760
So, from this kind of thing,
if the recombination frequency

00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:41.754
is much less
than 50%, then they're on the

00:35:41.754 --> 00:35:43.687
same chromosome.

00:35:43.687 --> 00:35:48.296
And the word
geneticists use to describe

00:35:48.296 --> 00:35:51.714
this is they say genes are
linked.

00:35:51.714 --> 00:35:55.915
If the
recombination frequency is 50%,

00:35:55.915 --> 00:36:00.000
then they are on different
chromosomes.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.754
At this point,
it's just random assortment.

00:36:02.754 --> 00:36:05.966
You go one way or
the other so you get a number

00:36:05.966 --> 00:36:08.705
of 50% if you do this kind of
calculation.

00:36:08.705 --> 00:36:10.882
And these are referred to as
unlinked.

00:36:10.882 --> 00:36:13.757
And those of you
who are thinking about it can

00:36:13.757 --> 00:36:16.000
probably imagine that there
might be

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.925
a problem, that if you had a
very long chromosome,

00:36:18.925 --> 00:36:22.033
so the two genes
you are studying were very far

00:36:22.033 --> 00:36:25.937
apart, you might get so many
recombination events in between

00:36:25.937 --> 00:36:28.000
that it would begin to look,
the

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:32.000
recombination frequency might
come close to 50%.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:36.461
And you would perhaps have a
difficult time in that genetic

00:36:36.461 --> 00:36:39.132
cross
telling whether the genes are

00:36:39.132 --> 00:36:40.308
really unlinked.

00:36:40.308 --> 00:36:42.882
They were on separate
chromosomes,

00:36:42.882 --> 00:36:45.676
or they were linked but very
far apart.

00:36:45.676 --> 00:36:49.313
So this kind of
thing could be a little hard to

00:36:49.313 --> 00:36:51.626
resolve that kind of situation.

00:36:51.626 --> 00:36:54.142
But
there are other things you can

00:36:54.142 --> 00:36:55.500
do to look at that.

00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:59.456
So, the chromosomes
we've been talking about are

00:36:59.456 --> 00:37:02.000
what are known as autosomes.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.483
These are identical pairs.

00:37:04.483 --> 00:37:06.870
But there's an exception.

00:37:06.870 --> 00:37:11.103
And those are
the genes that are involved in

00:37:11.103 --> 00:37:12.725
sex determination.

00:37:12.725 --> 00:37:17.402
It's the chromosomes
that are involved in sex

00:37:17.402 --> 00:37:18.921
determination.

00:37:18.921 --> 00:37:22.280
These are known as
heterosomes.

00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:27.599
And, they're on this picture
that I showed you where they

00:37:27.599 --> 00:37:34.000
used this technique of
chromosome painting to show it.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:38.816
You can see how all these
autosomes are in identical

00:37:38.816 --> 00:37:39.383
pairs.

00:37:39.383 --> 00:37:42.499
But this is
a male, obviously,

00:37:42.499 --> 00:37:45.521
because there's the
Y-chromosome,

00:37:45.521 --> 00:37:47.599
and there is an X.

00:37:47.599 --> 00:37:52.456
If you're a female,
you'd have two copies of the X,

00:37:52.456 --> 00:37:56.150
something I think
most of you know.

00:37:56.150 --> 00:38:01.199
So, if we think about how this
works in humans,

00:38:01.199 --> 00:38:08.000
females have two X's,
and males have an X and a Y.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.470
In Drosophila,
the fruit fly,

00:38:10.470 --> 00:38:12.235
it's the same thing.

00:38:12.235 --> 00:38:14.000
Males have two X.

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:17.705
Females have two X's,
and males have an XY.

00:38:17.705 --> 00:38:22.485
But there isn't anything
magic in nature about females

00:38:22.485 --> 00:38:26.000
having two of the same,
and males having

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:31.538
one of each because in birds
where it's different enough they

00:38:31.538 --> 00:38:34.261
use
different notation.

00:38:34.261 --> 00:38:37.713
The females have one of each.

00:38:37.713 --> 00:38:40.876
And
let me make sure I got my

00:38:40.876 --> 00:38:42.345
notation right.

00:38:42.345 --> 00:38:45.284
I think it's ZZ,
excuse me.

00:38:45.284 --> 00:38:48.713
And the females have one of
each.

00:38:48.713 --> 00:38:56.428
So, nature tends to use these
differences as far as sex

00:38:56.428 --> 00:38:59.000
determination.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:02.163
And this, then,
poses a new kind of problem.

00:39:02.163 --> 00:39:04.076
And that is,
what would

00:39:04.076 --> 00:39:08.079
happen if you were doing a
cross, and the allele that you

00:39:08.079 --> 00:39:10.819
are studying
happened to be on a sex

00:39:10.819 --> 00:39:13.285
chromosome instead of one of
these?

00:39:13.285 --> 00:39:16.244
You might
guess that since females have

00:39:16.244 --> 00:39:19.304
two of one and males have one of
each that

00:39:19.304 --> 00:39:23.719
I would not give the results
that are predicted by what we've

00:39:23.719 --> 00:39:25.520
talked
about so far.

00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:29.460
And so, this led to the
discovery of what's

00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:31.614
known as sex linkage.

00:39:31.614 --> 00:39:33.768
And that's important.

00:39:33.768 --> 00:39:37.763
And in fact,
as you'll see in a minute,

00:39:37.763 --> 00:39:41.920
affects stuff that we are
familiar with in

00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:42.865
our lives.

00:39:42.865 --> 00:39:47.023
I want to just quickly
introduce you to this,

00:39:47.023 --> 00:39:50.615
and show you
how it was discovered.

00:39:50.615 --> 00:39:55.152
It was done by Thomas Morgan in
1910 actually,

00:39:55.152 --> 00:39:56.678
this discovery.

00:39:56.678 --> 00:40:01.768
What he was doing was he took a
white eyed male,

00:40:01.768 --> 00:40:06.078
crossed it with a red eyed
female wild type,

00:40:06.078 --> 00:40:13.390
and yet the expected
result that the F1s were all

00:40:13.390 --> 00:40:15.000
red eye.

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:20.743
But then when he took the F1
female, which was red,

00:40:20.743 --> 00:40:25.250
and crossed it with a
red eyed male,

00:40:25.250 --> 00:40:32.000
you got something that was very
puzzling at the time.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.201
The females were all red.

00:40:34.201 --> 00:40:37.635
The males, half of them had red
eyes,

00:40:37.635 --> 00:40:40.029
and half of them had white
eyes.

00:40:40.029 --> 00:40:43.271
If you followed the logic up
until now,

00:40:43.271 --> 00:40:47.954
where you try to work this out,
you would find that you

00:40:47.954 --> 00:40:51.263
couldn't
generate this pattern by the

00:40:51.263 --> 00:40:54.039
stuff that we've talked about
now.

00:40:54.039 --> 00:40:56.687
So
once again, this led to the

00:40:56.687 --> 00:41:00.181
need to create a new model,
something that

00:41:00.181 --> 00:41:02.215
expanded our thinking.

00:41:02.215 --> 00:41:05.545
So, the way the thinking went
was,

00:41:05.545 --> 00:41:09.971
well, there must be something
to do with the sex of the fruit

00:41:09.971 --> 00:41:11.052
fly in
this.

00:41:11.052 --> 00:41:15.140
And so, here was the
hypothesis, and that was that

00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:17.470
the
white eyed male had this

00:41:17.470 --> 00:41:18.124
genotype.

00:41:18.124 --> 00:41:20.815
They had an allele that caused
the

00:41:20.815 --> 00:41:21.819
white eyeness.

00:41:21.819 --> 00:41:25.907
But it was located on the X
chromosome so that the male

00:41:25.907 --> 00:41:31.000
would have had a Y chromosome
paired with that.

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:36.925
And, the red eyed female used
in the first cross would have a

00:41:36.925 --> 00:41:41.098
wild type
allele on both X chromosomes.

00:41:41.098 --> 00:41:45.219
And so, if that were the model,
what's

00:41:45.219 --> 00:41:51.057
going to happen to them when we
do this cross that we've

00:41:51.057 --> 00:41:52.954
described
here?

00:41:52.954 --> 00:41:56.573
Well, let's think it through.

00:41:56.573 --> 00:42:02.031
So, we've got female
whose X plus.

00:42:02.031 --> 00:42:09.199
We're crossing with the male
who's

00:42:09.199 --> 00:42:16.534
got the X with the white allele
over the Y.

00:42:16.534 --> 00:42:27.908
So, the females can either
be, they'll get an X plus XW,

00:42:27.908 --> 00:42:34.000
and the males,
yeah, right.

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:40.222
The males are going to get,
they will get this allele for

00:42:40.222 --> 00:42:40.444
Y.

00:42:40.444 --> 00:42:43.800
So
now, if he takes us red eyed

00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:48.000
female, that was the F1 from the
cross up

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:53.687
here, which will be this,
and crossed with a red eyed

00:42:53.687 --> 00:42:54.234
male.

00:42:54.234 --> 00:42:59.520
Now,
that means the male has to have

00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:02.000
the good allele.

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:04.430
What are we going to get?

00:43:04.430 --> 00:43:09.000
Well, for the females in this
cross, we've got

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:11.676
a couple of possibilities.

00:43:11.676 --> 00:43:16.000
This one, we could get just the
wild type

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:19.818
female back,
or we could get this one

00:43:19.818 --> 00:43:23.000
pairing with this one,
which

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:25.519
will give us this.

00:43:25.519 --> 00:43:30.000
So, these are all red that fit.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:33.718
But, the males,
then, if you see what happens,

00:43:33.718 --> 00:43:37.120
they have to have,
each have to have a Y,

00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:40.907
and then they can either get
this allele or that

00:43:40.907 --> 00:43:41.523
allele.

00:43:41.523 --> 00:43:44.690
If they get this allele,
they're red.

00:43:44.690 --> 00:43:47.468
If this allele,
they're white.

00:43:47.468 --> 00:43:51.815
If you stand back and look at
that, you will see that

00:43:51.815 --> 00:43:54.309
is the outcome that was
observed.

00:43:54.309 --> 00:43:55.946
Females were all red.

00:43:55.946 --> 00:43:59.504
The males are
half red, half white.

00:43:59.504 --> 00:44:03.333
Well, this is a characteristic
of,

00:44:03.333 --> 00:44:06.463
this would be an X-linked
trait.

00:44:06.463 --> 00:44:09.998
And I want to just point out
one

00:44:09.998 --> 00:44:10.614
thing.

00:44:10.614 --> 00:44:14.306
This female,
excuse me, wrong female.

00:44:14.306 --> 00:44:18.887
This female here is
what's referred to as a

00:44:18.887 --> 00:44:19.659
carrier.

00:44:19.659 --> 00:44:23.331
She's got this allele that
causes a

00:44:23.331 --> 00:44:30.000
white guy, but she's not
expressing it herself.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.887
But she's able to transmit it
to her sons.

00:44:32.887 --> 00:44:35.000
And when she has progeny,
on

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:38.515
average, half of her sons will
have the trait.

00:44:38.515 --> 00:44:42.071
And now, X-linked
traits, there are a number of

00:44:42.071 --> 00:44:43.785
them that we know about.

00:44:43.785 --> 00:44:46.212
Some of you may
know hemophilia.

00:44:46.212 --> 00:44:50.000
Queen Victoria was a carrier of
this gene causing

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:53.680
hemophilia, where there is a
problem with the clotting

00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:54.375
mechanism.

00:44:54.375 --> 00:44:56.750
And if
you get a cut,

00:44:56.750 --> 00:45:00.000
then you can bleed a lot.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:01.986
So, some of her sons had this.

00:45:01.986 --> 00:45:04.570
A more common one,
which has to apply

00:45:04.570 --> 00:45:08.771
to some people in this room,
is red-green color blindness.

00:45:08.771 --> 00:45:10.224
If
you're a male,

00:45:10.224 --> 00:45:13.710
you have a much higher
probability of being

00:45:13.710 --> 00:45:16.350
colorblind because it's an
X-linked trait.

00:45:16.350 --> 00:45:19.673
And I want to just close by
showing you how human

00:45:19.673 --> 00:45:22.390
geneticists think about the sort
of thing.

00:45:22.390 --> 00:45:24.925
And
we have to think about things

00:45:24.925 --> 00:45:27.425
differently if we are doing
human

00:45:27.425 --> 00:45:31.996
genetics because as most of you
know, I think all of us would be

00:45:31.996 --> 00:45:36.031
very uncooperative subjects in
a kind of genetic cross that a

00:45:36.031 --> 00:45:38.333
fruit
fly geneticist or most

00:45:38.333 --> 00:45:41.141
geneticists would like to have
us

00:45:41.141 --> 00:45:45.713
do, in which we'd be put in a
cage with a member of the other

00:45:45.713 --> 00:45:47.062
sex and say,
mate.

00:45:47.062 --> 00:45:49.364
That was your choice in life.

00:45:49.364 --> 00:45:51.846
Well,
that would be a different kind

00:45:51.846 --> 00:45:53.323
of existence for us all.

00:45:53.323 --> 00:45:55.542
So, human
geneticists don't have that

00:45:55.542 --> 00:45:58.000
luxury of having pure breeding
strains and

00:45:58.000 --> 00:45:59.864
doing controlled crosses.

00:45:59.864 --> 00:46:02.400
We all have very strong
feelings

00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:06.109
about the kind of crosses that
we want to engage in.

00:46:06.109 --> 00:46:08.312
And so, what
they have to do,

00:46:08.312 --> 00:46:11.164
they have to make use with what
they find.

00:46:11.164 --> 00:46:14.004
And they
use a couple of symbols here

00:46:14.004 --> 00:46:15.724
that I'll just show you.

00:46:15.724 --> 00:46:18.876
They look at
pedigrees, and then they look

00:46:18.876 --> 00:46:19.807
for patterns.

00:46:19.807 --> 00:46:23.390
And, they use a little
shorthand for doing this.

00:46:23.390 --> 00:46:26.398
Males are squares,
which I don't know if

00:46:26.398 --> 00:46:30.704
there's any symbolism to that
or not, but if they are affected

00:46:30.704 --> 00:46:33.324
they
show it as a shaded square,

00:46:33.324 --> 00:46:36.000
and unaffected as an open
symbol.

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:38.617
So, affected males are solid
squares.

00:46:38.617 --> 00:46:41.298
Affected females are solid
circles.

00:46:41.298 --> 00:46:45.452
So, let's take a look at the
sort of pedigree that human

00:46:45.452 --> 00:46:46.981
geneticists might see.

00:46:46.981 --> 00:46:48.997
And let's consider something.

00:46:48.997 --> 00:46:51.886
Let's consider
red-green color blindness,

00:46:51.886 --> 00:46:53.659
which is an X-linked trait.

00:46:53.659 --> 00:46:57.083
So, let's take a
male, which there is probably

00:46:57.083 --> 00:46:59.635
one in this room at least,
maybe

00:46:59.635 --> 00:47:01.303
more, who have this.

00:47:01.303 --> 00:47:04.306
So, since the colorblindness
trait

00:47:04.306 --> 00:47:08.378
is on the X chromosome since
he's a male, the other pair will

00:47:08.378 --> 00:47:08.920
be Y.

00:47:08.920 --> 00:47:12.217
That means if you're a male and
you've got it,

00:47:12.217 --> 00:47:15.248
you're going to
display the phenotypes.

00:47:15.248 --> 00:47:18.152
So this is, George,
let's say, who is

00:47:18.152 --> 00:47:18.898
colorblind.

00:47:18.898 --> 00:47:22.360
They leave a lot of the romance
out of these things,

00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:24.628
as
you'll see, who had progeny

00:47:24.628 --> 00:47:25.317
with Mary.

00:47:25.317 --> 00:47:30.210
Let's say, they got married
after they graduated from MIT.

00:47:30.210 --> 00:47:32.000
It was very happy.

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:34.511
They had a, let's see,
son.

00:47:34.511 --> 00:47:37.313
He had to get the Y from dad.

00:47:37.313 --> 00:47:41.998
So, he had
to get a good allele from his

00:47:41.998 --> 00:47:42.803
mother.

00:47:42.803 --> 00:47:48.248
But they also had a
daughter, and she had to get

00:47:48.248 --> 00:47:51.998
the color blindness allele on an
X

00:47:51.998 --> 00:47:57.220
chromosome because the dad only
had one of them,

00:47:57.220 --> 00:48:01.571
and then a
good one from her mom.

00:48:01.571 --> 00:48:05.666
So at this point,
everybody's

00:48:05.666 --> 00:48:06.432
normal.

00:48:06.432 --> 00:48:11.794
But you'll notice,
this daughter has this trait of

00:48:11.794 --> 00:48:16.390
being a
carrier because even though she

00:48:16.390 --> 00:48:20.331
doesn't display the trait
herself,

00:48:20.331 --> 00:48:23.631
she's got it in her genome.

00:48:23.631 --> 00:48:27.664
So, let's say,
this son marries

00:48:27.664 --> 00:48:35.000
a woman who doesn't have any
colorblindness allele.

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:37.896
So, if we have,
let's say, a daughter,

00:48:37.896 --> 00:48:40.166
and a son, a daughter,
and

00:48:40.166 --> 00:48:44.116
a son, this is not much
happening over on the part of

00:48:44.116 --> 00:48:45.331
the pedigree.

00:48:45.331 --> 00:48:47.336
Everybody would be normal.

00:48:47.336 --> 00:48:49.418
Yeah, did I miss something?

00:48:49.418 --> 00:48:49.958
Pardon?

00:48:49.958 --> 00:48:51.423
Oh,
it's over Y.

00:48:51.423 --> 00:48:54.430
Excuse me, yep,
I'm going too fast here.

00:48:54.430 --> 00:48:56.113
Over Y, here
we go.

00:48:56.113 --> 00:49:00.831
I don't need to introduce any
genetic abnormalities on top of

00:49:00.831 --> 00:49:03.693
what we're already trying to do
here.

00:49:03.693 --> 00:49:06.000
This is complicated enough.

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:08.991
OK, so what happens,
let's say then that the

00:49:08.991 --> 00:49:12.475
daughter that married a
guy, and they had four

00:49:12.475 --> 00:49:13.161
children.

00:49:13.161 --> 00:49:16.627
I'm going to help us with the
genetics of it,

00:49:16.627 --> 00:49:19.987
from the geneticist,
that sort of a perfect family

00:49:19.987 --> 00:49:22.435
in
this case would be four kids

00:49:22.435 --> 00:49:25.199
representing all four
possibilities.

00:49:25.199 --> 00:49:29.140
And so, first off let's think
what would happen with the

00:49:29.140 --> 00:49:30.000
daughters.

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:37.304
Well, the daughters could
either have the colorblindness

00:49:37.304 --> 00:49:41.289
allele
paired with this one.

00:49:41.289 --> 00:49:47.000
Or, they could get a wild type
allele with

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:48.092
this one.

00:49:48.092 --> 00:49:52.342
So actually,
I'd better put this in.

00:49:52.342 --> 00:49:55.500
So this is a daughter.

00:49:55.500 --> 00:50:04.000
So this would be CB over plus,
or it could be plus over plus.

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:07.250
This one would,
again, be a carrier.

00:50:07.250 --> 00:50:10.500
Now, with the sons,
they're both

00:50:10.500 --> 00:50:14.089
going to get the Y since
they're male.

00:50:14.089 --> 00:50:20.099
But there's a possibility of
either getting the good allele,

00:50:20.099 --> 00:50:23.500
which means he'll be
unaffected.

00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:30.000
But, if you get the other one,
he'll be affected.

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:32.293
Now, this would be sort of a
typical pedigree.

00:50:32.293 --> 00:50:34.473
And you realize,
depending on the number of

00:50:34.473 --> 00:50:36.197
kids, you might or might not see
this.

00:50:36.197 --> 00:50:37.928
But
this, you're going to get to do

00:50:37.928 --> 00:50:39.786
some more of these and to do
some other

00:50:39.786 --> 00:50:40.160
traits.

00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:43.047
But let me just sort of point
out, if you're a human

00:50:43.047 --> 00:50:44.906
geneticist, what you would
recognize here,

00:50:44.906 --> 00:50:46.632
the trait's more frequent in
males.

00:50:46.632 --> 00:50:49.574
The frequency of color
blindness is about 8% on the X

00:50:49.574 --> 00:50:50.080
chromosome.

00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:52.563
So, if you're a female,
you've got to have two of them.

00:50:52.563 --> 00:50:54.163
So
that means, you've got 0.64%

00:50:54.163 --> 00:50:56.103
because you've got to get two
together.

00:50:56.103 --> 00:50:57.709
It's a much smaller
probability.

00:50:57.709 --> 00:51:00.295
The trait skips a generation,
We often say.

00:51:00.295 --> 00:51:01.437
You see it here.

00:51:01.437 --> 00:51:02.366
You see here.

00:51:02.366 --> 00:51:04.551
But
you don't see it in between,

00:51:04.551 --> 00:51:06.597
and that's because you have
this

00:51:06.597 --> 00:51:07.024
carrier.

00:51:07.024 --> 00:51:09.903
The affected males don't
transmit to their sons because

00:51:09.903 --> 00:51:12.108
what
they give to their sons is the

00:51:12.108 --> 00:51:12.226
Y.

00:51:12.226 --> 00:51:15.270
So, they can't give them the
colorblindness thing.

00:51:15.270 --> 00:51:17.797
And then, the heterozygous
females who are

00:51:17.797 --> 00:51:20.702
carriers will transmit the
trait to their sons about half

00:51:20.702 --> 00:51:21.168
the time.

00:51:21.168 --> 00:51:23.307
And
that's a pattern that a human

00:51:23.307 --> 00:51:24.898
geneticist would look for.

00:51:24.898 --> 00:51:26.666
And
they'd say, ah-ha,

00:51:26.666 --> 00:51:29.000
it must be an X-linked trait.

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:33.102
And you'll see in your problem
sets and recitation sections are

00:51:33.102 --> 00:51:34.118
the
patterns.

00:51:34.118 --> 00:51:35.918
OK, I'll see you on Friday.
