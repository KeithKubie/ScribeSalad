00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:03.660
A couple of videos ago, we
learned that a function that

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:13.550
is a mapping from the set x to
the set y is invertible if and

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:19.070
only if-- and I'll write that as
a if with two f's --if and

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:24.160
only if for every y-- so
let me write this down.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.480
I'll do this in yellow.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:35.610
For every y that is a member of
our co-domain, there exists

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:46.260
a unique-- and I'll make that a
little bit bold --a unique x

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:56.730
that is a member of our domain,
such that f of this x

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.580
is equal to this y.

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:03.320
So that's just saying that if
I take my domain right here,

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:09.410
that's x, and then I take a
co-domain here, that is y, we

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:11.290
say that the function
f is invertible.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:16.740
And we know what invertibility
means.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.337
It means that there's this
other function called the

00:01:19.337 --> 00:01:22.410
inverse that can essentially,
if you take that in

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:25.145
composition with f, it's like
taking the identity on x.

00:01:25.145 --> 00:01:27.360
Or if you take f in composition
with it, it's like

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.850
taking the identity on y.

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.130
And we've done that multiple
times so I

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:31.330
won't repeat that there.

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.360
We know what invertibility
means, but we learned that

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.290
it's invertible, if and only if,
for every y here, so you

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.320
take any y here, any y that's
a member of your co-domain,

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.740
there exists a unique x,
such that f of x is

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:46.990
equal to that y.

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.908
Let me write it this way.

00:01:51.908 --> 00:01:56.370
If this is an x, let's say
that's an x not, f of x not

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.020
would be equal to y.

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.390
So this y would be equal
to f of x not.

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:02.450
You apply the function here.

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.860
It's going to map it
to this point here.

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.670
It wouldn't be invertible
if you had this.

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.870
If you had two members
of x mapping here.

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.400
That would break invertibility
if you had this situation,

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.270
because then you wouldn't have
the unique condition.

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.980
You have to have a unique x
that maps to this thing.

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.050
And what I just drew here, this
other pink mapping, we

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.750
don't have a unique x that maps
to y, we have two x's

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.040
that map to y.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.960
Now, based on what I just told
you on that last video, what

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.342
does this mean?

00:02:33.342 --> 00:02:37.110
If we have a unique x
that maps to each y?

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.910
That means that we have to have
a one-to-one mapping.

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.200
That f has to be one-to-one.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.820
Let me write that.

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:48.470
Another way of saying
this, is that f is

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.220
one-to-one, or injective.

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.210
If we have two guys mapping to
the same y, that would break

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:00.030
down this condition.

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.170
We wouldn't be one-to-one and
we couldn't say that there

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:09.440
exists a unique x solution to
this equation right here.

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.290
Now, the other part of this is
that for every y -- you could

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.560
pick any y here and there
exists a unique x

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.840
that maps to that.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.540
There cannot be some y here.

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.640
Let's say that there's some y
here, and no one maps to that.

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:33.810
If that's the case, then we
don't have our conditions for

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.070
invertibility.

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:39.380
So that would be
not invertible.

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:43.550
Everything in y, every element
of y, has to be mapped to.

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:45.510
All of these guys have
to be mapped to.

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.110
And they can only be mapped to
by one of the elements of x.

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.940
Everything here has to be mapped
to by a unique guy.

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.100
Now, in the last video, what did
we call it went a function

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:00.350
maps to every element
of your co-domain?

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:03.940
So this every here, what is
another way of saying that?

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.220
That a function maps to every
element of your co-domain?

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.940
On the last video I explained
that notion is called a

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:19.730
surjective or onto function.

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:22.150
So the whole reason why I'm
doing this video is because I

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.360
really just want to restate
this condition for

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.280
invertibility using the
vocabulary that I introduced

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.020
to you in the last video.

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:36.800
So given that the statement for
every y that's a member of

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.370
our co-domain, there exists
a x that maps to it.

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:42.220
We could just say that
f is surjective.

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:51.450
If we just say that f is
surjective, that means that

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:53.070
everything here is mapped to.

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.440
But it could be mapped to, maybe
this person right here,

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.090
could be mapped to
by more than one.

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:02.150
Surjective doesn't, by itself,
make the condition that

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.830
there's a unique mapping
from a member of x to

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:05.895
that element of y.

00:05:05.895 --> 00:05:09.130
So in order to get that, in
order to satisfy the unique

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:12.200
condition of this condition for
invertibility, we have to

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:15.665
say that f is also injective.

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.130
And obviously, maybe the less
formal terms for either of

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:25.950
these, you call this onto,
and you could call this

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:28.700
one-to-one.

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:31.280
So using the terminology that we
learned in the last video,

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.340
we can restate this condition
for invertibility.

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:38.290
We can say that a function that
is a mapping from the

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:48.820
domain x to the co-domain y is
invertible, if and only if --

00:05:48.820 --> 00:06:03.320
I'll write it out -- f is both
surjective and injective.

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:09.530
Or we could have said, that f is
invertible, if and only if,

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:18.200
f is onto and one-to-one.

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.110
And these are really just fancy
ways of saying for every

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:26.290
y in our co-domain, there's a
unique x that f maps to it.

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:30.850
There isn't more than one and
every y does get mapped to.
