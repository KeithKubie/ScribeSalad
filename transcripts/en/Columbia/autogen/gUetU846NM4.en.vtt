general searches we come up with very

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369
general searches we come up with very
 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.510
general searches we come up with very
little and there's a huge gaps in the

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520
little and there's a huge gaps in the
 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:02.060
little and there's a huge gaps in the
data for for aap eyes and there's such a

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070
data for for aap eyes and there's such a
 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.840
data for for aap eyes and there's such a
range of difference between the East

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479
tend smaller pockets of API communities
 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.770
tend smaller pockets of API communities
in the middle parts of the country in

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780
in the middle parts of the country in
 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.240
in the middle parts of the country in
the American South and we are often as a

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250
the American South and we are often as a
 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.670
the American South and we are often as a
group generalized I mean the term Asian

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680

alone includes so many different

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319
alone includes so many different
 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:25.920
alone includes so many different
cultures and so many different ethnic

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930
cultures and so many different ethnic
 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.250
cultures and so many different ethnic
groups you know subgroups people speak

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260
groups you know subgroups people speak
 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
groups you know subgroups people speak
different dialects and all kinds of

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270
different dialects and all kinds of
 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.960
different dialects and all kinds of
languages and it's a really generalize

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970
languages and it's a really generalize
 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.130
languages and it's a really generalize
charm and so we find that we're often

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140
charm and so we find that we're often
 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.410
charm and so we find that we're often
kind of shoved in that other category or

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420
kind of shoved in that other category or
 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.920
kind of shoved in that other category or
we don't appear at all and many in many

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930
we don't appear at all and many in many
 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.470
we don't appear at all and many in many
ethnic writedowns when one comes to data

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480
ethnic writedowns when one comes to data
 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.930
ethnic writedowns when one comes to data
and so we find that it's it's one of the

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940
and so we find that it's it's one of the
 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.050
and so we find that it's it's one of the
reasons is that we labor under the smile

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060
reasons is that we labor under the smile
 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.449
reasons is that we labor under the smile
of minority myth and it predicates this

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459
of minority myth and it predicates this
 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:01.259
of minority myth and it predicates this
assumption that our community is you

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269
assumption that our community is you
 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:03.300
assumption that our community is you
know I always say model minority model

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310
know I always say model minority model
 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.270
know I always say model minority model
health and so you know it makes it seem

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280
health and so you know it makes it seem
 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.210
health and so you know it makes it seem
as if this community doesn't doesn't

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220
as if this community doesn't doesn't
 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.390
as if this community doesn't doesn't
have any health needs you know I'm

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400
have any health needs you know I'm
 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.430
have any health needs you know I'm
they're doing well economically they're

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440
they're doing well economically they're
 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.580
they're doing well economically they're
doing well they're doing well in schools

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590
doing well they're doing well in schools
 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.660
doing well they're doing well in schools
they have the highest highest rates of

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670
they have the highest highest rates of
 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.400
they have the highest highest rates of
graduation rates and you know high

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410
graduation rates and you know high
 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.870
graduation rates and you know high
levels of education but but it's but

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880
levels of education but but it's but
 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:28.979
levels of education but but it's but
there's actually no proof of that

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989
there's actually no proof of that
 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:30.600
there's actually no proof of that
there's actually very little

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610
there's actually very little
 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.930
there's actually very little
surveillance in our community about

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940
surveillance in our community about
 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:38.250
surveillance in our community about
about health in particular um so another

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260
about health in particular um so another
 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.210
about health in particular um so another
reason that we see these gaps that we

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220
reason that we see these gaps that we
 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.800
reason that we see these gaps that we
believe that we see these gaps is that

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810
believe that we see these gaps is that
 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.500
believe that we see these gaps is that
aps are poorly represented in community

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510
aps are poorly represented in community
 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.259
aps are poorly represented in community
research and so you know i mean it's

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:49.269
research and so you know i mean it's
 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:51.270
research and so you know i mean it's
it's a very common stereotype that

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280
it's a very common stereotype that
 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.380
it's a very common stereotype that
asians are you know where oh you know we

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390
asians are you know where oh you know we
 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:57.390
asians are you know where oh you know we
do well in school and you know we become

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400
do well in school and you know we become
 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.750
do well in school and you know we become
doctors and lawyers and and while we are

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760
doctors and lawyers and and while we are
 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.550
doctors and lawyers and and while we are
very well represented in health field

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560
very well represented in health field
 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.140
very well represented in health field
were not really well represented in

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150
were not really well represented in
 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.479
were not really well represented in
health and health research and that

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:06.489
health and health research and that
 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:08.330
health and health research and that
becomes a problem because

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340
becomes a problem because
 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.570
becomes a problem because
um certainly my own experience in our in

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580
um certainly my own experience in our in
 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.220
um certainly my own experience in our in
our research at the health center we

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230
our research at the health center we
 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.280
our research at the health center we
find that a lot of the a lot of the

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290
find that a lot of the a lot of the
 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:18.319
find that a lot of the a lot of the
research that's out there is actually

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:18.329
research that's out there is actually
 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:20.930
research that's out there is actually
not very culturally competent and we see

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940
not very culturally competent and we see
 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.280
not very culturally competent and we see
a lot of sort of you know blisters and

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.290
a lot of sort of you know blisters and
 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.830
a lot of sort of you know blisters and
bubbles in in the way that the community

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840
bubbles in in the way that the community
 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:33.560
bubbles in in the way that the community
is described in a way that in the way

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570
is described in a way that in the way
 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.890
is described in a way that in the way
that we were sorry in a way that were

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900
that we were sorry in a way that were
 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.040
that we were sorry in a way that were
described in the way that where we

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050
described in the way that where we
 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.890
described in the way that where we
approached as a community and in this in

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900
approached as a community and in this in
 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.500
approached as a community and in this in
sort of so-called community-based

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.510
sort of so-called community-based
 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:48.409
sort of so-called community-based
participatory research and we find that

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:48.419
participatory research and we find that
 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:51.379

people who are part of the community to
 

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:52.140
people who are part of the community to
actually conduct the research and so we

00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:52.150
actually conduct the research and so we
 

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:55.680
actually conduct the research and so we
can sort of assure that that will have a

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:55.690
can sort of assure that that will have a
 

00:09:55.690 --> 00:09:57.540
can sort of assure that that will have a
little more cultural competency a little

that bridge for the potential researcher
 

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:46.830
that bridge for the potential researcher
and the academic institution or if you

00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:46.840
and the academic institution or if you
 

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:48.780
and the academic institution or if you
know if it's it's an academic who is

interested in doing research in the

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:50.410
interested in doing research in the
 

00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:52.500
interested in doing research in the
community we bridge them with the

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:52.510
community we bridge them with the
 

00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:59.369
community we bridge them with the
community organization

00:10:59.369 --> 00:10:59.379
 
 

00:10:59.379 --> 00:11:06.029
 
so this very convoluted chart is the the

00:11:06.029 --> 00:11:06.039
so this very convoluted chart is the the
 

00:11:06.039 --> 00:11:09.210
so this very convoluted chart is the the
rundown of our and I'm sorry it's not as

00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:09.220
rundown of our and I'm sorry it's not as
 

00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:12.659
rundown of our and I'm sorry it's not as
clear as it should be it's basically the

00:11:12.659 --> 00:11:12.669
clear as it should be it's basically the
 

00:11:12.669 --> 00:11:15.929
clear as it should be it's basically the
rundown of our of our training program

00:11:15.929 --> 00:11:15.939
rundown of our of our training program
 

00:11:15.939 --> 00:11:18.269
rundown of our of our training program
and so we begin with with a background

00:11:18.269 --> 00:11:18.279
and so we begin with with a background
 

00:11:18.279 --> 00:11:20.099
and so we begin with with a background
we start with an overview of our

00:11:20.099 --> 00:11:20.109
we start with an overview of our
 

00:11:20.109 --> 00:11:22.799
we start with an overview of our
community and its it was formerly a

00:11:22.799 --> 00:11:22.809
community and its it was formerly a
 

00:11:22.809 --> 00:11:25.289
community and its it was formerly a
three-day seminar and now it's been

00:11:25.289 --> 00:11:25.299
three-day seminar and now it's been
 

00:11:25.299 --> 00:11:29.009
three-day seminar and now it's been
reduced down to one day and and explain

00:11:29.009 --> 00:11:29.019
reduced down to one day and and explain
 

00:11:29.019 --> 00:11:32.189
reduced down to one day and and explain
why and Anna later slide we start with

00:11:32.189 --> 00:11:32.199
why and Anna later slide we start with
 

00:11:32.199 --> 00:11:34.589
why and Anna later slide we start with
an overview of the community and we will

00:11:34.589 --> 00:11:34.599
an overview of the community and we will
 

00:11:34.599 --> 00:11:35.969
an overview of the community and we will
often find that we're preaching to the

00:11:35.969 --> 00:11:35.979
often find that we're preaching to the
 

00:11:35.979 --> 00:11:38.729
often find that we're preaching to the
choir but we do feel it's important to

00:11:38.729 --> 00:11:38.739
choir but we do feel it's important to
 

00:11:38.739 --> 00:11:40.289
choir but we do feel it's important to
at least dress those issues particularly

00:11:40.289 --> 00:11:40.299
at least dress those issues particularly
 

00:11:40.299 --> 00:11:43.049
at least dress those issues particularly
if there are trainings that year who are

00:11:43.049 --> 00:11:43.059
if there are trainings that year who are
 

00:11:43.059 --> 00:11:45.749
if there are trainings that year who are
not as familiar with the a community in

00:11:45.749 --> 00:11:45.759
not as familiar with the a community in
 

00:11:45.759 --> 00:11:48.210
not as familiar with the a community in
New York because as I said before many

00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:48.220
New York because as I said before many
 

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:50.249
New York because as I said before many
of the API communities on the west coast

00:11:50.249 --> 00:11:50.259
of the API communities on the west coast
 

00:11:50.259 --> 00:11:52.079
of the API communities on the west coast
are very different from the ones on the

00:11:52.079 --> 00:11:52.089
are very different from the ones on the
 

00:11:52.089 --> 00:11:55.769
are very different from the ones on the
east coast and after that or that

00:11:55.769 --> 00:11:55.779
east coast and after that or that
 

00:11:55.779 --> 00:11:58.460
east coast and after that or that
orientation day we begin with with

00:11:58.460 --> 00:11:58.470
orientation day we begin with with
 

00:11:58.470 --> 00:12:03.889
orientation day we begin with with
providing tools and so we do we do

00:12:03.889 --> 00:12:03.899
providing tools and so we do we do
 

00:12:03.899 --> 00:12:06.539
providing tools and so we do we do
research methods for both qualitative

00:12:06.539 --> 00:12:06.549
research methods for both qualitative
 

00:12:06.549 --> 00:12:11.879
research methods for both qualitative
and quantitative research we we help

00:12:11.879 --> 00:12:11.889
and quantitative research we we help
 

00:12:11.889 --> 00:12:14.759
and quantitative research we we help
them decide how how to create what kind

00:12:14.759 --> 00:12:14.769
them decide how how to create what kind
 

00:12:14.769 --> 00:12:16.409
them decide how how to create what kind
of sample to use and how to create that

00:12:16.409 --> 00:12:16.419
of sample to use and how to create that
 

00:12:16.419 --> 00:12:19.619
of sample to use and how to create that
sample on how to collect data what are

00:12:19.619 --> 00:12:19.629
sample on how to collect data what are
 

00:12:19.629 --> 00:12:22.109
sample on how to collect data what are
the notes nuts and bolts of starting a

00:12:22.109 --> 00:12:22.119
the notes nuts and bolts of starting a
 

00:12:22.119 --> 00:12:24.899
the notes nuts and bolts of starting a
research project then we launch into a

00:12:24.899 --> 00:12:24.909
research project then we launch into a
 

00:12:24.909 --> 00:12:26.519
research project then we launch into a
few months later we launch into the

00:12:26.519 --> 00:12:26.529
few months later we launch into the
 

00:12:26.529 --> 00:12:29.489
few months later we launch into the
application part and that's the data

00:12:29.489 --> 00:12:29.499
application part and that's the data
 

00:12:29.499 --> 00:12:32.449
application part and that's the data
analysis part so hopefully at this point

00:12:32.449 --> 00:12:32.459
analysis part so hopefully at this point
 

00:12:32.459 --> 00:12:35.039
analysis part so hopefully at this point
about three to three or four months into

00:12:35.039 --> 00:12:35.049
about three to three or four months into
 

00:12:35.049 --> 00:12:38.789
about three to three or four months into
the program the trainees have collected

00:12:38.789 --> 00:12:38.799
the program the trainees have collected
 

00:12:38.799 --> 00:12:42.210
the program the trainees have collected
some amount of data Oh some of them have

00:12:42.210 --> 00:12:42.220
some amount of data Oh some of them have
 

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:44.399
some amount of data Oh some of them have
been very fortunate to use secondary

00:12:44.399 --> 00:12:44.409
been very fortunate to use secondary
 

00:12:44.409 --> 00:12:46.439
been very fortunate to use secondary
data amongst or some of our former

00:12:46.439 --> 00:12:46.449
data amongst or some of our former
 

00:12:46.449 --> 00:12:50.249
data amongst or some of our former
trainees and they've they're able to

00:12:50.249 --> 00:12:50.259
trainees and they've they're able to
 

00:12:50.259 --> 00:12:52.019
trainees and they've they're able to
start on the data analysis part and

00:12:52.019 --> 00:12:52.029
start on the data analysis part and
 

00:12:52.029 --> 00:12:54.809
start on the data analysis part and
what's really great about about this

00:12:54.809 --> 00:12:54.819
what's really great about about this
 

00:12:54.819 --> 00:12:56.729
what's really great about about this
part of the process of the training

00:12:56.729 --> 00:12:56.739
part of the process of the training
 

00:12:56.739 --> 00:13:00.929
part of the process of the training
program is that we can we we have a very

00:13:00.929 --> 00:13:00.939
program is that we can we we have a very
 

00:13:00.939 --> 00:13:03.179
program is that we can we we have a very
small intimate group it's about six to

00:13:03.179 --> 00:13:03.189
small intimate group it's about six to
 

00:13:03.189 --> 00:13:05.429
small intimate group it's about six to
eight trainees per year and we sit

00:13:05.429 --> 00:13:05.439
eight trainees per year and we sit
 

00:13:05.439 --> 00:13:07.169
eight trainees per year and we sit
around table and we brainstorm and

00:13:07.169 --> 00:13:07.179
around table and we brainstorm and
 

00:13:07.179 --> 00:13:09.509
around table and we brainstorm and
everyone shares their progress in the

and another person raises the question
 

00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:33.330
and another person raises the question
of concern that maybe they're not

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:33.340
of concern that maybe they're not
 

00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:35.100
of concern that maybe they're not
approaching it in the right way or

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:35.110
approaching it in the right way or
 

00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:37.290
approaching it in the right way or
they're missing something in the way

00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:37.300
they're missing something in the way
 

00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:38.490
they're missing something in the way
that they're approaching in and maybe

00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:38.500
that they're approaching in and maybe
 

00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:39.840
that they're approaching in and maybe
that's why they're not getting their

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:39.850
that's why they're not getting their
 

00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:42.360
that's why they're not getting their
data so it's a very it's a very great

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:42.370
data so it's a very it's a very great
 

00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:45.030
data so it's a very it's a very great
opportunity and way to for all of us to

00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:45.040
opportunity and way to for all of us to
 

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:49.290
opportunity and way to for all of us to
workshop with each other on our on each

00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:49.300
workshop with each other on our on each
 

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:52.520
workshop with each other on our on each
individual project and of course we

00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:52.530
individual project and of course we
 

00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:54.600
individual project and of course we
typically have our speaker in the room

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:54.610
typically have our speaker in the room
 

00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:56.880
typically have our speaker in the room
and so the speaker will usually conduct

00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:56.890
and so the speaker will usually conduct
 

00:13:56.890 --> 00:14:00.930
and so the speaker will usually conduct
that roundtable discussion and then

00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:00.940
that roundtable discussion and then
 

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:03.210
that roundtable discussion and then
after after we're done with the tools

00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:03.220
after after we're done with the tools
 

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:06.920
after after we're done with the tools
and and the application we come to the

00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:06.930
and and the application we come to the
 

00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:09.770
and and the application we come to the
sort of the conference period where we

00:14:09.770 --> 00:14:09.780
sort of the conference period where we
 

00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:12.210
sort of the conference period where we
we let them work independently for a

00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:12.220
we let them work independently for a
 

00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:14.580
we let them work independently for a
while and then we keep on them we see if

00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:14.590
while and then we keep on them we see if
 

00:14:14.590 --> 00:14:17.730
while and then we keep on them we see if
they've they've conducted you know all

00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:17.740
they've they've conducted you know all
 

00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:19.400
they've they've conducted you know all
their data collection and if they've

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:19.410
their data collection and if they've
 

00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:22.560
their data collection and if they've
finally done all their their analysis of

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:22.570
finally done all their their analysis of
 

00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:26.820
finally done all their their analysis of
their data and we we get them ready by

00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:26.830
their data and we we get them ready by
 

00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:30.500
their data and we we get them ready by
by asking you to prepare an abstract for

00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:30.510
by asking you to prepare an abstract for
 

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:34.310
by asking you to prepare an abstract for
the asian american health conference

00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:34.320
the asian american health conference
 

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:36.210
the asian american health conference
this year the asian american health

00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:36.220
this year the asian american health
 

00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:38.580
this year the asian american health
conference will actually be an opto in

00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:38.590
conference will actually be an opto in
 

00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:40.230
conference will actually be an opto in
the beginning of october so it's there's

00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:40.240
the beginning of october so it's there's
 

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:44.100
the beginning of october so it's there's
a little bit of a lag there and they

00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:44.110
a little bit of a lag there and they
 

00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:47.580
a little bit of a lag there and they
have they have spots open or a setup for

00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:47.590
have they have spots open or a setup for
 

00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:50.160
have they have spots open or a setup for
them there's no there's no real

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:50.170
them there's no there's no real
 

00:14:50.170 --> 00:14:53.250
them there's no there's no real
application process and so they'll

00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:53.260
application process and so they'll
 

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.440
application process and so they'll
automatically accepted into into the

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:55.450
automatically accepted into into the
 

00:14:55.450 --> 00:14:58.110
automatically accepted into into the
conference and they're given opportunity

00:14:58.110 --> 00:14:58.120
conference and they're given opportunity
 

00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:00.270
conference and they're given opportunity
to get a feel for what a conference

00:15:00.270 --> 00:15:00.280
to get a feel for what a conference
 

00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:03.900
to get a feel for what a conference
presentation is like and and an

00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:03.910
presentation is like and and an
 

00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:06.630
presentation is like and and an
opportunity to share their data prior to

00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:06.640
opportunity to share their data prior to
 

00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:09.930
opportunity to share their data prior to
that we try to set up a time where at

00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:09.940
that we try to set up a time where at
 

00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:10.610
that we try to set up a time where at
our

00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:10.620
our
 

00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:13.460
our
at the health center all those trainees

00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:13.470
at the health center all those trainees
 

00:15:13.470 --> 00:15:16.220
at the health center all those trainees
are able to share their share their work

00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:16.230
are able to share their share their work
 

00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:19.700
are able to share their share their work
with members of sisa and n charles be

00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:19.710
with members of sisa and n charles be
 

00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:24.080
with members of sisa and n charles be
wrong and a lot of sort of a rehearsal

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:24.090
wrong and a lot of sort of a rehearsal
 

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:26.780
wrong and a lot of sort of a rehearsal
time for them before they present their

00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:26.790
time for them before they present their
 

00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:29.750
time for them before they present their
their presentations at the seesaw

00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:29.760
their presentations at the seesaw
 

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:37.690
their presentations at the seesaw
conference so the way we we choose the

00:15:37.690 --> 00:15:37.700
conference so the way we we choose the
 

00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:39.980
conference so the way we we choose the
trainees is that we have a training poor

00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:39.990
trainees is that we have a training poor
 

00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:42.770
trainees is that we have a training poor
committee and that's made up of faculty

00:15:42.770 --> 00:15:42.780
committee and that's made up of faculty
 

00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:47.090
committee and that's made up of faculty
and staff from from both the CPW and C

00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:47.100
and staff from from both the CPW and C
 

00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:50.330
and staff from from both the CPW and C
so we basically we come together we sort

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:50.340
so we basically we come together we sort
 

00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:52.760
so we basically we come together we sort
of brown baguette and just talk about

00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:52.770
of brown baguette and just talk about
 

00:15:52.770 --> 00:15:55.850
of brown baguette and just talk about
each of the the applicants usually we

00:15:55.850 --> 00:15:55.860
each of the the applicants usually we
 

00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:58.850
each of the the applicants usually we
have about roughly 10 to 15 applicants

00:15:58.850 --> 00:15:58.860
have about roughly 10 to 15 applicants
 

00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:01.370
have about roughly 10 to 15 applicants
and we pare that down from there our

00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:01.380
and we pare that down from there our
 

00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:04.850
and we pare that down from there our
eligibility criteria well we try to be

00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:04.860
eligibility criteria well we try to be
 

00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:06.560
eligibility criteria well we try to be
as flexible as possible I mean these are

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:06.570
as flexible as possible I mean these are
 

00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:08.810
as flexible as possible I mean these are
some of the criteria we try to be as

00:16:08.810 --> 00:16:08.820
some of the criteria we try to be as
 

00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:10.010
some of the criteria we try to be as
such as well as possible because some

00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:10.020
such as well as possible because some
 

00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:12.440
such as well as possible because some
some people have more experience than

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:12.450
some people have more experience than
 

00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:14.780
some people have more experience than
others and some may not have as much

00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:14.790
others and some may not have as much
 

00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:17.030
others and some may not have as much
academic background but have a lot more

00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:17.040
academic background but have a lot more
 

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:18.680
academic background but have a lot more
experience and so we try to be as

00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:18.690
experience and so we try to be as
 

00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:20.120
experience and so we try to be as
flexible as possible and we try to look

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:20.130
flexible as possible and we try to look
 

00:16:20.130 --> 00:16:27.480
flexible as possible and we try to look
at each applicant as a whole

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:27.490
 
 

00:16:27.490 --> 00:16:32.040
 
so the program basically includes

00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:32.050
 
 

00:16:32.050 --> 00:16:34.569
 
sharing being able to share a practical

00:16:34.569 --> 00:16:34.579
sharing being able to share a practical
 

00:16:34.579 --> 00:16:37.569
sharing being able to share a practical
knowledge and experience with the the

00:16:37.569 --> 00:16:37.579
knowledge and experience with the the
 

00:16:37.579 --> 00:16:38.920

monthly seminar series and they're also
 

00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:44.319
monthly seminar series and they're also
paired up if you look at that large

00:16:44.319 --> 00:16:44.329
paired up if you look at that large
 

00:16:44.329 --> 00:16:46.300
paired up if you look at that large
arrow they're also paired up with the

00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:46.310
arrow they're also paired up with the
 

00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:49.600
arrow they're also paired up with the
mentor the mentors are often the

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:49.610
mentor the mentors are often the
 

00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:54.759
mentor the mentors are often the
speakers that come monthly some of the

00:16:54.759 --> 00:16:54.769
speakers that come monthly some of the
 

00:16:54.769 --> 00:16:56.560
speakers that come monthly some of the
trainees will bring someone they have in

00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:56.570
trainees will bring someone they have in
 

00:16:56.570 --> 00:16:58.030
trainees will bring someone they have in
mind that they've been dying to work

00:16:58.030 --> 00:16:58.040
mind that they've been dying to work
 

00:16:58.040 --> 00:16:59.259
mind that they've been dying to work
with they really want to do research

00:16:59.259 --> 00:16:59.269
with they really want to do research
 

00:16:59.269 --> 00:17:01.090
with they really want to do research
with them and so we try to make that

00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:01.100
with them and so we try to make that
 

00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:04.409
with them and so we try to make that
happen through our web of contacts and

00:17:04.409 --> 00:17:04.419
happen through our web of contacts and
 

00:17:04.419 --> 00:17:07.360
happen through our web of contacts and
and get them connected to the person

00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:07.370
and get them connected to the person
 

00:17:07.370 --> 00:17:09.069
and get them connected to the person
that they really want to work with and

who has some has their own vested
 

00:17:12.350 --> 00:17:16.870
who has some has their own vested
interest in the research project sit and

00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:16.880
interest in the research project sit and
 

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:18.939
interest in the research project sit and
there are several written assignments

00:17:18.939 --> 00:17:18.949
there are several written assignments
 

00:17:18.949 --> 00:17:21.130
there are several written assignments
and we try to have them keep sort of a

00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:21.140
and we try to have them keep sort of a
 

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:24.340
and we try to have them keep sort of a
blog of their progress and so that we

00:17:24.340 --> 00:17:24.350
blog of their progress and so that we

outcomes again I apologize for the tiny
 

00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:46.450
outcomes again I apologize for the tiny
type for research topic areas it really

00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:46.460
type for research topic areas it really
 

00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:51.940
type for research topic areas it really
runs a range and and and we really try

00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:51.950
runs a range and and and we really try

runs a range and and and we really try
in choosing our trainees we really try

00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:54.290
in choosing our trainees we really try
 

00:17:54.290 --> 00:17:59.260
in choosing our trainees we really try
to do when we look at the entire package

00:17:59.260 --> 00:17:59.270
to do when we look at the entire package
 

00:17:59.270 --> 00:18:01.840
to do when we look at the entire package
of each applicant we really try to think

00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:01.850
of each applicant we really try to think
 

00:18:01.850 --> 00:18:04.060
of each applicant we really try to think
about you know what what areas are

00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:04.070
about you know what what areas are
 

00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:06.820
about you know what what areas are
really what a hot topic areas in the

00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:06.830
really what a hot topic areas in the
 

00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:10.000
really what a hot topic areas in the
community where were the gaps in the

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:10.010
community where were the gaps in the
 

00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:12.000
community where were the gaps in the
community that we need the information

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:12.010
community that we need the information
 

00:18:12.010 --> 00:18:15.460
community that we need the information
and so we have been very fortunate to

00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:15.470
and so we have been very fortunate to
 

00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:17.799
and so we have been very fortunate to
have trainees who have these they come

00:18:17.799 --> 00:18:17.809
have trainees who have these they come
 

00:18:17.809 --> 00:18:22.210
have trainees who have these they come
with ideas for different areas in the

00:18:22.210 --> 00:18:22.220
with ideas for different areas in the
 

00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:24.250
with ideas for different areas in the
community were there isn't data and they

00:18:24.250 --> 00:18:24.260
community were there isn't data and they
 

00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:27.250
community were there isn't data and they
would like to really look at

00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:27.260
would like to really look at
 

00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:29.720
would like to really look at
what's going on and why don't we have

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:29.730
what's going on and why don't we have
 

00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:30.890
what's going on and why don't we have
the data and why isn't there a

00:18:30.890 --> 00:18:30.900
the data and why isn't there a
 

00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:32.870
the data and why isn't there a
literature out there so we've been very

00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:32.880
literature out there so we've been very
 

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:37.610
literature out there so we've been very
fortunate in that respect the alumni and

we're a 15 month program is but it's
 

00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:44.090
we're a 15 month program is but it's
very difficult to encourage CBPR which

00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:44.100
very difficult to encourage CBPR which
 

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:47.330
very difficult to encourage CBPR which
takes several years to get together to

00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:47.340
takes several years to get together to
 

00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:49.190
takes several years to get together to
even start the data collection and to

00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:49.200
even start the data collection and to
 

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:50.660
even start the data collection and to
build those relationships it's very

00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:50.670
build those relationships it's very
 

00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:53.510
build those relationships it's very
difficult to ask a group of of eight ave

00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:53.520
difficult to ask a group of of eight ave

trainees to to create those

00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:55.950
trainees to to create those
 

00:19:55.950 --> 00:19:58.760
trainees to to create those
relationships in 15 months and get their

00:19:58.760 --> 00:19:58.770
relationships in 15 months and get their
 

00:19:58.770 --> 00:20:00.680
relationships in 15 months and get their
data collection analyzed and get ready

00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:00.690
data collection analyzed and get ready

00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:09.860
 
so lessons learned that be flexible we

00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:09.870
so lessons learned that be flexible we
 

00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:13.460
so lessons learned that be flexible we
have been very very flexible and a large

00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:13.470
have been very very flexible and a large
 

00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:15.800
have been very very flexible and a large
part of the job of the training

00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:15.810
part of the job of the training
 

00:20:15.810 --> 00:20:17.690
part of the job of the training
coordinator is just keeping up with

00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:17.700
coordinator is just keeping up with
 

00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:21.350
coordinator is just keeping up with
everyone and chasing them down I you

00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:21.360
everyone and chasing them down I you
 

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:23.960
everyone and chasing them down I you
know anyone's ever worked with students

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:23.970
know anyone's ever worked with students
 

00:20:23.970 --> 00:20:26.120
know anyone's ever worked with students
in this capacity know that you know it's

00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:26.130
in this capacity know that you know it's
 

00:20:26.130 --> 00:20:28.910
in this capacity know that you know it's
it add the work ebbs and flows and so

00:20:28.910 --> 00:20:28.920
it add the work ebbs and flows and so
 

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:31.070
it add the work ebbs and flows and so
you really have to make sure that people

00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:31.080
you really have to make sure that people
 

00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:33.820
you really have to make sure that people
are doing everything and many of our

00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:33.830
are doing everything and many of our
 

00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:37.070
are doing everything and many of our
trainees are full-time fully full-time

00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:37.080
trainees are full-time fully full-time
 

00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:40.430
trainees are full-time fully full-time
employed somewhere or are full-time

00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:40.440
employed somewhere or are full-time
 

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:43.010
employed somewhere or are full-time
students and so they all sometimes

00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:43.020
students and so they all sometimes
 

00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:44.870
students and so they all sometimes
forget that they have things to do and

00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:44.880
forget that they have things to do and
 

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:48.830
forget that they have things to do and
and that this research to do we're also

00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:48.840
and that this research to do we're also
 

00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:51.110
and that this research to do we're also
a free program and we don't provide a

00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:51.120
a free program and we don't provide a
 

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:54.260
a free program and we don't provide a
stipend and so we often find that that

00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:54.270
stipend and so we often find that that
 

00:20:54.270 --> 00:20:56.300
stipend and so we often find that that
the incentive is not there for them to

00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:56.310
the incentive is not there for them to
 

00:20:56.310 --> 00:21:01.210
the incentive is not there for them to
to get everything done and completed um

00:21:01.210 --> 00:21:01.220
to get everything done and completed um
 

00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:04.790
to get everything done and completed um
we really want to always want to

00:21:04.790 --> 00:21:04.800
we really want to always want to
 

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:06.380
we really want to always want to
schedule time for discussion again as I

00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:06.390
schedule time for discussion again as I
 

00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:08.180
schedule time for discussion again as I
said the workshop the work shopping

00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:08.190
said the workshop the work shopping
 

00:21:08.190 --> 00:21:09.920
said the workshop the work shopping
times are really important to the

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:09.930
times are really important to the
 

00:21:09.930 --> 00:21:12.260
times are really important to the
trainees they often asked for it they

00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:12.270
trainees they often asked for it they
 

00:21:12.270 --> 00:21:14.360
trainees they often asked for it they
often complain if there's not time for

00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:14.370
often complain if there's not time for
 

00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:17.360
often complain if there's not time for
the workshop periods sometimes I would

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:17.370
the workshop periods sometimes I would
 

00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:19.010
the workshop periods sometimes I would
set up a separate time with them and we

00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:19.020
set up a separate time with them and we
 

00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:22.070
set up a separate time with them and we
would separately without a speaker have

00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:22.080
would separately without a speaker have
 

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:24.110
would separately without a speaker have
a separate discussion group so that we

00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:24.120
a separate discussion group so that we
 

00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:28.580
a separate discussion group so that we
can all brainstorm together and you know

00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:28.590
can all brainstorm together and you know
 

00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:30.880
can all brainstorm together and you know
allow the curriculum to evolve over time

changed over time and we've added things

00:21:36.050 --> 00:21:36.060
changed over time and we've added things
 

00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:38.150
changed over time and we've added things
that we thought were now more salient

00:21:38.150 --> 00:21:38.160
that we thought were now more salient
 

00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:42.140
that we thought were now more salient
and we learned from what what our

00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:42.150
and we learned from what what our
 

00:21:42.150 --> 00:21:44.180
and we learned from what what our
curriculum was in the past and we've

00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:44.190
curriculum was in the past and we've
 

00:21:44.190 --> 00:21:46.820
curriculum was in the past and we've
changed it to accommodate the needs of

00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:46.830
changed it to accommodate the needs of
 

00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:49.070
changed it to accommodate the needs of
the trainees and every year in our in

our application process we ask the
 

00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:52.760
our application process we ask the
training is what you know what they're

00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:52.770
training is what you know what they're
 

00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:54.890
training is what you know what they're
what they're looking for in terms of

00:21:54.890 --> 00:21:54.900
what they're looking for in terms of
 

00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:58.970
what they're looking for in terms of
being able to conduct the research

and you know these other people like so
 

00:22:03.310 --> 00:22:05.010
and you know these other people like so
now a lot of people are involved in

now a lot of people are involved in
 

00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:07.560
now a lot of people are involved in
working on this many of them are no

longer with either organization but are
 

00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:12.270
longer with either organization but are
still very much involved and and you

leave the organization they become a
 

00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:17.700
leave the organization they become a
large network and we keep growing that

00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:17.710
large network and we keep growing that
 

00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:23.850
large network and we keep growing that
network we really look at the health

00:22:23.850 --> 00:22:23.860
network we really look at the health
 

00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:25.770

the point is that we want to generalize

00:24:59.279 --> 00:24:59.289
the point is that we want to generalize
 

00:24:59.289 --> 00:25:02.399
the point is that we want to generalize
our populations day and make our

00:25:02.399 --> 00:25:02.409
our populations day and make our
 

00:25:02.409 --> 00:25:04.889
our populations day and make our
population general and say that you know

00:25:04.889 --> 00:25:04.899
population general and say that you know
 

00:25:04.899 --> 00:25:09.749

we have all the same problems as all the
other groups we just need to find out

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:12.250
other groups we just need to find out
 

00:25:12.250 --> 00:25:14.310
other groups we just need to find out
what those issues are and where we need

00:25:14.310 --> 00:25:14.320
what those issues are and where we need
 

00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:17.190
what those issues are and where we need
to focus our attention you know it's

00:25:17.190 --> 00:25:17.200
to focus our attention you know it's
 

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:19.619
to focus our attention you know it's
it's it's not my Nordic model minority

00:25:19.619 --> 00:25:19.629
it's it's not my Nordic model minority
 

00:25:19.629 --> 00:25:26.999
it's it's not my Nordic model minority
model health and we are as an

00:25:26.999 --> 00:25:27.009
model health and we are as an
 

00:25:27.009 --> 00:25:29.879
model health and we are as an
organization we this program really

00:25:29.879 --> 00:25:29.889
organization we this program really
 

00:25:29.889 --> 00:25:32.519
organization we this program really
starts the seed of generating that

00:25:32.519 --> 00:25:32.529
starts the seed of generating that
 

00:25:32.529 --> 00:25:35.789
starts the seed of generating that
information and and then hopefully

00:25:35.789 --> 00:25:35.799
information and and then hopefully
 

00:25:35.799 --> 00:25:37.320
information and and then hopefully
dispensing it and you know that's the

00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:37.330
dispensing it and you know that's the
 

00:25:37.330 --> 00:25:39.840
dispensing it and you know that's the
point of of the tail end of the program

00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:39.850
point of of the tail end of the program
 

00:25:39.850 --> 00:25:43.980
point of of the tail end of the program
where we where we have conference

00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:43.990
where we where we have conference
 

00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:46.860
where we where we have conference
abstracts and we really help them to

00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:46.870
abstracts and we really help them to
 

00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:50.480
abstracts and we really help them to
disseminate the information by printing

00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:50.490
disseminate the information by printing
 

00:25:50.490 --> 00:25:52.970
disseminate the information by printing
by printing health information which

00:25:52.970 --> 00:25:52.980
by printing health information which
 

00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:55.590

they've worked with on their project and
 

00:25:58.779 --> 00:26:03.299
they've worked with on their project and
also to to have a data bank for people

00:26:03.299 --> 00:26:03.309
also to to have a data bank for people
 

00:26:03.309 --> 00:26:06.119
also to to have a data bank for people
who might be interested in in you know

00:26:06.119 --> 00:26:06.129
who might be interested in in you know
 

00:26:06.129 --> 00:26:08.940
who might be interested in in you know
substance use we've had people who work

00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:08.950
substance use we've had people who work
 

00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:11.759
substance use we've had people who work
on cvd we have people who work on men

00:26:11.759 --> 00:26:11.769
on cvd we have people who work on men
 

00:26:11.769 --> 00:26:16.230
on cvd we have people who work on men
mental health and so we have created

00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:16.240
mental health and so we have created
 

00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:19.950
mental health and so we have created
this hodgepodge of different disease

00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:19.960
this hodgepodge of different disease
 

00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:23.490

areas health very different health
 

00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:26.220
areas health very different health
issues and we put them all into a sort

00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:26.230
issues and we put them all into a sort
 

00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:27.930
issues and we put them all into a sort
of data bank and hopefully people will

00:26:27.930 --> 00:26:27.940
of data bank and hopefully people will
 

00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:28.989

industrialize and develop people start

00:35:33.850 --> 00:35:33.860
industrialize and develop people start
 

00:35:33.860 --> 00:35:35.950
industrialize and develop people start
to leave and because they have more

00:35:35.950 --> 00:35:35.960

00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:37.930
money in there they are able to leave
 

00:35:37.930 --> 00:35:40.810
money in there they are able to leave
and so they'll they'll insert this

places to come is to New York and so
then that shifts or population yet again

00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:47.810
then that shifts or population yet again
 

00:35:47.810 --> 00:35:50.980
then that shifts or population yet again
