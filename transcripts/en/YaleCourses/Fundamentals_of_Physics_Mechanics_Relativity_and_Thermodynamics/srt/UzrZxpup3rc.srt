1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:03,930
Let's begin a part two of rotations.

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:09,690
I thought I should summarize for you the
main points because you learned a whole

3
00:00:09,691 --> 00:00:13,050
lot of stuff but you don't have
to carry all that in your head.

4
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:17,490
What I'm going to write down is the
essential subject you should know,

5
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:23,460
so we were going to do
rotation of rigid bodies,

6
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:28,560
which are forced to lie on the x,
y plane and they have some shape

7
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:35,950
and here are the main ideas. You should
know your first pick a point I don't,

8
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:39,870
which you want to rotate the body by
driving a little skewer through that.

9
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:45,120
That's the point of rotation.
Then here are the things we learned.

10
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:49,890
First of all,
the body has a mass m the simple thing,

11
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:51,930
you put it on a weighing machine,
that's the mass.

12
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:54,630
Then it has a moment of inertia,

13
00:00:56,110 --> 00:01:00,360
which if the body were
made of for discrete set of
points would be the massive

14
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:05,390
each point m some I named the square
foot distance from the point of rotation,

15
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,540
but a continuous distribution
of matter like this one,

16
00:01:12,541 --> 00:01:14,000
the Sam is replaced by an intake.

17
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:16,293
Yeah.

18
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:22,020
But example for a rod youth
was m l square over 12 our own,

19
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,320
one of the ends are on the
center of mass and 40 disk.

20
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:35,610
It was m r square over two so
everybody has a moment of inertia.

21
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:41,230
Here's the important caveat with
respect to a particular point,

22
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:45,580
there is nothing called the more medical
issue because depending on the point

23
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:50,110
these distances we'll be
okay. Then if you want that,

24
00:01:50,111 --> 00:01:54,010
it did body to start doing interesting
things. You want it to move around.

25
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,620
It will have an angular velocity Omega,

26
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:59,890
which is the rate at which
it goes round and round.

27
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:05,230
It's the usual frequency times two Pi
because two Pi ready and set up full

28
00:02:05,231 --> 00:02:09,400
circle.
Then it has an angular momentum,

29
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:14,110
which is the analog of the mass and
the analog of the velocity is just

30
00:02:14,111 --> 00:02:16,210
universally denoted by the symbol l.

31
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:19,390
Yeah.

32
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:21,550
Then if you want to change
this angular momentum,

33
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:26,220
it's like asking how do you change the
ordinary moment then more of a particular

34
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:29,500
play force, so no, we apply
what's called a torque.

35
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:33,760
The torque is the reason the
angular momentum changes.

36
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:39,040
That's the analog of forces. The
reason, the usual momentum changes.

37
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:43,660
I remind you peace and V,
so it is really m DVD,

38
00:02:43,661 --> 00:02:45,370
t equals m.

39
00:02:45,371 --> 00:02:49,030
A so you can answer
right analogous be here.

40
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:54,370
How equals I alpha because if you take
the d by Dt of this guy that's a constant

41
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,410
at Alpha is at eight of tangible Omega.

42
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,080
Yeah.

43
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,040
Last thing I have to tell

44
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:04,570
you is what is the park or
the total torque on a body?

45
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:07,090
We are live. That is a force. For example,

46
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:12,250
acting in that direction.
Let me just take one force.

47
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:17,740
It is separated by a distance are auto
vector are from the point of rotation.

48
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:23,520
They find that angle data as the angle
between this point of separation,

49
00:03:23,771 --> 00:03:28,771
distance of separation art and the
applied force than the Torque is f times r

50
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:33,930
five signed data.
Yeah.

51
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:37,810
If you took after be perpendicular
to this separation vector,

52
00:03:37,811 --> 00:03:42,430
then scientists one your book have to
be a paddle at the separation vector at

53
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:44,990
park vanishes because it's no use,

54
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:49,090
no use applying a force in
the line joining you to the
center because you don't

55
00:03:49,091 --> 00:03:53,500
produce patients that just signed data
tells you how much of the force is good

56
00:03:53,501 --> 00:03:58,290
at producing rotations. If you've
got many forces and many targets,

57
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,350
you got to add all the torques.
That's one thing to be careful about.

58
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:03,761
For example,

59
00:04:03,761 --> 00:04:07,510
you can have a body where one force is
trained to do that and he had maybe a

60
00:04:07,511 --> 00:04:11,050
second force acting that way.
Trying to do the opposite.

61
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:14,250
So we keep track of the Torque by saying,

62
00:04:14,251 --> 00:04:17,530
hey that it's clockwise or
counter clockwise eat fours.

63
00:04:17,531 --> 00:04:19,480
You can tell intuitively by looking at it,

64
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:24,580
this guy's making it go counter clockwise.
This rotating clockwise,

65
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:28,390
counterclockwise, we'll be taken positive
clockwise, we'll be taken negative.

66
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:31,451
Similarly,

67
00:04:31,451 --> 00:04:35,430
angular acceleration will be positive
if it's counterclockwise increase.

68
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:41,320
So this is somebody of what
everything we did yesterday on Monday.

69
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:43,810
You guys follow that?

70
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:48,160
So there's an analogy to f equals m a
everything has rotational counterpart,

71
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:52,690
but life is more difficult because in
the case of f equals m a m was simply

72
00:04:52,691 --> 00:04:55,520
given to you here the moment of inertia.

73
00:04:55,521 --> 00:05:00,490
It has to be calculated from scratch
given the mass distribution that forms the

74
00:05:00,491 --> 00:05:02,530
body.
Similarly,

75
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:06,250
you may have been simply given
the forces in f equals I may,

76
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,650
but he had even after
I give you the forces,

77
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:11,660
you got to do some work
calculating the Torque,

78
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:16,420
but every force you've got to find how
far it is from the point of rotation.

79
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:21,420
What's the angle between the force in
the vector separating where the forces to

80
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:24,700
bear the rotation is taking place
and calculating the same day.

81
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:32,090
Okay, so that's all we did and what I
did towards the end of the class was to

82
00:05:32,091 --> 00:05:36,890
calculate the moment of inertia for a
couple of objects I showed you for the

83
00:05:36,891 --> 00:05:40,160
disc.
It's Mr squared over two for the Rod.

84
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:42,830
I did two calculations.

85
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:48,400
One was around this end and the want
me to finish here around the end was ml

86
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:53,890
square over three and the
moment of inertia around the
center was ml square over

87
00:05:55,131 --> 00:05:55,964
12

88
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:01,070
and at the end of the lecture I
said notice the following fact,

89
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:06,110
that moment of Venetia through the end
and the one that did finish here through

90
00:06:06,111 --> 00:06:10,160
the center of mass are
related in a very simple way.

91
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:14,770
We're just the moment of inertia with
respect to the new point is more men

92
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:19,780
definition of the Spec to the center
plus the mass of the entire Rod Times the

93
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:25,570
square of the distance Ello
were two squared separating
the access going through

94
00:06:27,561 --> 00:06:29,540
the center of mass and the new access

95
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,470
and that's called the
parallel access theater.

96
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,050
And I'm going to show you
in general why it is true

97
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:41,961
battle.

98
00:06:41,961 --> 00:06:46,240
Alexis theorem says that if you know the
more metal finisher who the center of

99
00:06:46,241 --> 00:06:50,740
mass you are done because then the moment
of inertia through any other points

100
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:54,370
does not require you to go back and
do the whole integral. One more time.

101
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:57,400
I'll tell you the answer
once and for all the answers,

102
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,340
take the moment to finish of
the spectrum center of mass,

103
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:03,490
add to it in general,

104
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:08,590
the mass of the whole body times the
square of the distance between the center

105
00:07:08,591 --> 00:07:13,390
of mass and your new axis. For example,
you want to rotate it around this point,

106
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:16,770
that's the distance d,
Add that MD square.

107
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:21,670
So I said,
I don't want to just give you a result.

108
00:07:21,671 --> 00:07:25,570
I want to tell you where everything
comes from. So I will now prove this.

109
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:29,500
So let's start with that proof.

110
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:36,120
So this is the proof of the parallel
access theater before I do the paddle axis

111
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:39,280
theater and I'm going to
use one result in vectors.

112
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:43,840
So you might as well be reminded of
that because I use it freely and I don't

113
00:07:43,841 --> 00:07:46,930
want you to get caught in that.
If a is the vector,

114
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
then the length of a square is found by
taking a.eight.is the length of eight

115
00:07:56,741 --> 00:07:58,600
times the length of it,
eight times of course,

116
00:07:58,601 --> 00:08:03,601
sine of the angle between a and a angle
between and zero and course signage.

117
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,320
Just one.
Therefore,

118
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:08,620
the way to find the length of the vectors
or take the dot product or the vector

119
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:09,454
with itself.

120
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:15,230
No other way to say this is the dot
product of a and B. You remember it's a x,

121
00:08:15,231 --> 00:08:16,790
B x Plus Ayby.

122
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:21,730
So Abel itself is x squared plus y
squared, which is the length where a,

123
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:27,890
this is I want to use today is if
you take a vector, a add to it,

124
00:08:27,891 --> 00:08:32,450
the vector B, and he wanted to
find the length square of a plus B,

125
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:35,720
or you take the dot product
of that with itself.

126
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,113
Okay?

127
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,670
And when you do the dot product,

128
00:08:39,671 --> 00:08:42,550
you can open out the brackets as
if it does an ordinary product.

129
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:44,530
So you can do this in your head.

130
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:49,210
You will get the length of a
square from doing the a dot.

131
00:08:49,211 --> 00:08:53,290
A like the big square from doing
the Bedard B. Then you'll get an a.

132
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:56,100
Dot B plus B. Dot. A and are both equal.

133
00:08:56,510 --> 00:09:01,050
So you will get twice a week.
That's the result I want to use.

134
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,770
So here is the calculation.

135
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:12,130
So let's take some arbitrary optic

136
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:17,010
and you want to find the center,
the moment of inertia around that point.

137
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,753
Yeah.

138
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:22,730
This is the center of mass

139
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:29,000
and this is a part of the
body that I'm calling.

140
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:33,590
I actually you should integrate over it,
but let's do it as a song.

141
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:38,330
Mentally divide this body and
200,000 million tiny little squares,

142
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:42,740
which when tightly together found this
object because it's easier for me to work

143
00:09:42,741 --> 00:09:44,600
with some than with an integral.

144
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:49,620
So this fellow has some mass m I,

145
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:55,040
it has a location which is our I,

146
00:09:55,880 --> 00:10:00,880
I'm going to call it ra prime because
the prime means is the distance measured

147
00:10:00,981 --> 00:10:02,390
from this new access.

148
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:08,650
I'm going to visit the symbol Ri for
the separation from the center of mass.

149
00:10:09,531 --> 00:10:13,910
Big Center of mass is a privileged point.
All distances measured from it.

150
00:10:13,911 --> 00:10:16,580
One kid a prime.
If you pick an arbitrary point,

151
00:10:16,581 --> 00:10:17,990
I want to put a prime for that one.

152
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:24,220
Then d is a vector that tells you how
to go from your chosen access to the

153
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:26,630
center of mass.

154
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:34,900
So what does the moment of inertia I'm
paying to calculate with respect to this

155
00:10:34,901 --> 00:10:36,550
point in the summer when I,

156
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:42,460
the mass of the little fellow
here am I times r I prime square,

157
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,800
but ra prime square you can
see is the length of Ri Plus D.

158
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:56,890
Dot. Product with all right, let's
d using this is ebay established.

159
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,033
Wow.

160
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:04,370
Okay. Now let's start opening out the
bracket and look at the terms you will get

161
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:09,170
first. You pick dot product of this
guy with this guy, which is Ra Square.

162
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:14,720
That's going to be, am I all
right? Square somewhere, would I?

163
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:20,060
I think you guys can recognize that as
the moment of inertia with respect to the

164
00:11:20,061 --> 00:11:20,894
center of mass.

165
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:24,170
That's what you would do if I said point
in a moment of finish up this book,

166
00:11:24,171 --> 00:11:26,900
the center of Mass,
you'll take the square of that distance.

167
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:32,090
So the first time I get is just the eye,
this specter center of mass.

168
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:37,370
Now I purposely want to skip the
middle term and go to the last term

169
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:43,010
in the last term. That is no some over
right because d is the fixed vector.

170
00:11:43,011 --> 00:11:45,980
It doesn't have to do with
the particle. I, I get d. Dot.

171
00:11:45,981 --> 00:11:50,870
D which is just the square times,
some over all the masses,

172
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:55,120
which is just the total.
And that's part of the theater

173
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:58,570
because I got the two parts,

174
00:11:58,571 --> 00:12:03,100
say like I is ICM plus m d square.

175
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:09,070
The trouble is, uh, I got what
I want but I got more stuff.

176
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,150
I got to hope that the stuff
I don't want will go away.

177
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:17,000
Okay.
It's like putting a

178
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:19,140
washing machine or something.
And when you're done,

179
00:12:19,141 --> 00:12:22,580
you find three or four parts
in the ground. You don't
know where they are there.

180
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:27,480
In that case, uh, there's no solution
to that problem. But in this problem,

181
00:12:27,481 --> 00:12:28,620
there's a very nice solution.

182
00:12:28,621 --> 00:12:33,000
This stuff I don't want
is going to vanish.

183
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:39,220
It's going to vanish. And let's see why.
Advantages. Let's take the cross germs.

184
00:12:39,221 --> 00:12:42,850
The Cross. Jerome said like the two
eight dot. Beat terms. So here's the two,

185
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:48,820
one of the vectors a is the vector d
and it's going to be taking the dark

186
00:12:48,821 --> 00:12:53,821
product with m I r I summed over I

187
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,430
cause there's going to
be a d. Dot. Ri twice,

188
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:02,000
but d is not dependent
on the summation index.

189
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,370
It's common to all the terms
of some of you pull it up.

190
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:08,000
Now you can think about what this is.

191
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:10,880
This is every mass
multiplied by his position,

192
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:17,680
so take this guy some over
I m I r I divided by the
total mass and multiplied by

193
00:13:21,081 --> 00:13:23,270
the total mass,
but what is this?

194
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:24,903
Okay,

195
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,223
Yup.

196
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:34,500
That the center of mass but that the
center of mass in a coordinate system with

197
00:13:35,361 --> 00:13:36,760
the center of mass as the origin,

198
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,410
so you will get zero.

199
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:44,600
You I use, this is the origin take
Mri. That's the center of mass.

200
00:13:44,601 --> 00:13:46,460
It will have some
coordinators from that origin,

201
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:50,090
but these artists are all measured
from the center of mass itself.

202
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:51,670
If your computer,

203
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:55,340
the center of mass with the center of
mass is your origin of coordinates,

204
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:59,150
then it is zero.
One way to say that.

205
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:00,620
If you're sitting at the center of mass,

206
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:04,040
then all the masses are surrounding the
center of mass in such a way that the

207
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:07,400
weight of some of the positions
will be the center of mass,

208
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:11,710
but which will be then zero if
that you already have coordinates.

209
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:15,940
That's the reason this advantage,
this is a very useful result.

210
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:21,950
The center of mass coordinate in a
coordinate system at the center of mass at

211
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:25,880
the audit as the origin will therefore
be zero and that's where this drug

212
00:14:25,881 --> 00:14:28,640
manages.
Then I get the result I mentioned to you,

213
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:33,530
I use ice center of mass
plus and these square

214
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:41,900
and the rod was a special case of this,

215
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:46,580
but I put the equals l over to do
that exam. What does generally true?

216
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:53,990
Okay? One useful. One place where you may
find the result. Useful is the following.

217
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:58,760
Let's think about the moment of
furniture of a coin or a disc.

218
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:00,790
Okay?

219
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:02,830
If I want the moment to finish
here through the center,

220
00:15:02,831 --> 00:15:07,000
I truly have to calculate it.
You divided into concentric rings.

221
00:15:07,001 --> 00:15:09,460
The answer for each ring is simple.
You're do an integral.

222
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:10,840
You get Mr squared over two,

223
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:14,920
but suppose I say I want a moment
to finish through that point.

224
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:20,730
You know what I mean?
Stick the pin through that and rotate it.

225
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:25,710
If some wobbly motion it will perform
with that as the center more minute finish

226
00:15:25,711 --> 00:15:28,120
up to that point.
If you just went back to basics,

227
00:15:28,121 --> 00:15:32,290
it's very hard to calculate because you
can try you a little trick with concept

228
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:35,350
circles. That'll be nice. That'll be nice.

229
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:39,400
Then you'll run to the edge and after
that certain ones are not really full

230
00:15:39,401 --> 00:15:42,220
circles and depending on how far you go,

231
00:15:42,221 --> 00:15:46,120
you take different fractions of a circle
is not easy to do. That summation,

232
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:50,200
luckily leave the moment of
inertia was through the center.

233
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:54,100
The whole object is divided
into the concept of it rings
and you can do the some

234
00:15:54,101 --> 00:15:58,450
easily, but here is where
this DRM comes into play.

235
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:03,130
You don't have to do any
more work through this point.

236
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:06,560
It is Amr square over to that,

237
00:16:06,561 --> 00:16:11,470
the answer to the center plus and B
square where d is simply the distance from

238
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:15,490
the center of mass to
where you sent your access.

239
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,090
Okay.
All right,

240
00:16:19,091 --> 00:16:22,930
so that's one demonstrational
parallel axes, theater

241
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,620
on the proof of the
parallel Lexis theater.

242
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:31,060
Now I'm going to show you a similar
result because that's going to be also

243
00:16:31,061 --> 00:16:35,940
useful in the study of rigid bodies.
It has the very same flavors.

244
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:39,190
I wanted to do that side by side
and that's the following question.

245
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:43,270
Suppose you have a in two dimensions,

246
00:16:43,271 --> 00:16:48,271
a whole bunch of masters and one with
the location are one m with location art

247
00:16:49,991 --> 00:16:53,800
too and they're all moving around.
You know that given all the masses,

248
00:16:53,801 --> 00:16:57,340
that is something in some way here.
That's the center of mass are

249
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:05,560
as the bodies move. This is not
a fixed situation. The whole,

250
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:09,580
it could be a bunch of planets
traveling as seen by another galaxy.

251
00:17:09,581 --> 00:17:13,640
The whole solar system is drifting.
Then ask,

252
00:17:13,641 --> 00:17:15,610
the whole thing is drifting.
That center of mass,

253
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,640
which is the weighted average of the
location to, we'll also drift with that.

254
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:24,670
Now I want to write a formula for
the Kennedy Energy of this complex,

255
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:29,790
which is one half some
over I am I the I squared?

256
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:40,040
No. I want to look at the velocity of
this object of every object to be I,

257
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:45,520
I want to see it as the velocity of the
center of mass listed velocity relative

258
00:17:46,221 --> 00:17:50,440
to the center of mass, which I will
denote maybe with the symbol r [inaudible]

259
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:57,950
you see that every little speck is moving,

260
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:03,200
but let's ride in a frame moving with
the center of miles. Wherever it goes,

261
00:18:03,201 --> 00:18:06,510
we go with that.
We latch onto it as seen by us.

262
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,310
The body will have a velocity,
the a relative,

263
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:14,030
but from the point of view of the ground,
we should add to that velocity.

264
00:18:14,031 --> 00:18:16,640
The velocity of the center of mass to
get there the last year with respect to

265
00:18:16,641 --> 00:18:19,310
the ground are some
fixed coordinate system.

266
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:24,030
So let's do that same trick.

267
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,810
The expansion one half am
I? No, I think you will.

268
00:18:27,811 --> 00:18:31,890
Let me do this a little faster because
we've done the thing similarly to before.

269
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:34,890
Now I'm squatting velocities
in the of sweating positions.

270
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:40,610
So one term there'll be this capital v
itemized u is the velocity of the center

271
00:18:41,851 --> 00:18:44,580
of mass. I just don't want to
show the subsequent every time,

272
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:46,860
but capital B's center of mass,

273
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:51,870
so when I squared this via square,
I would get a v squared term.

274
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,500
Then I'll get a bi relative.

275
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:56,893
Okay.

276
00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:01,870
Squared term, and I'll get
across to him twice. V.

277
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:05,550
Dot.
Vi relative

278
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:08,950
some with all the products,

279
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:17,200
so let's expand the three terms.
The first term,

280
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,180
this is the last of central mass
has nothing to do with index ISO.

281
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:24,340
You can pull it out of the sun and what
will I get? I allowed up all the masters.

282
00:19:24,341 --> 00:19:29,020
I'll get the total mass.
I get that a zone one half MV square

283
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:34,390
that does a Kennedy energy off
the center of mass. Other words,

284
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,150
the center of mass,

285
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:39,200
if it's treated as a point containing
the entire mass of the object moving at

286
00:19:39,201 --> 00:19:43,840
the Velocity v, that's the kinetic
energy of the center of mass. Okay.

287
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:48,690
Then let me take this term.

288
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:52,160
This is some am I

289
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:57,200
the eye relative square.

290
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:04,190
What does that, you guys should think
about, what is this quantity stand for?

291
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:12,850
Can you tell me what it stands for?
Yeah.

292
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:17,720
The kinetic energy of the object's
relative to the central. Yeah.

293
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:21,960
It means if you're really traveling
with the center of mass and you made a

294
00:20:21,961 --> 00:20:24,150
measurement on how fast
everybody is moving,

295
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:27,900
this is the energy you will
attribute to these particles.

296
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:32,190
It's not the kinetic energy as seen by
somebody on the ground who is static, but,

297
00:20:32,191 --> 00:20:34,320
but somebody riding
with the center of mass.

298
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:39,570
So this is the Kennedy Energy.
A little bit of the center of mass.

299
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:44,790
We can give it some name. It's
whatever it is. But once again,

300
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:47,530
the costumes are going to vanish.
That's what I, to show you.

301
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:52,390
Let's look at a crossroad.
The two cancers, the half.
Then I get this capital.

302
00:20:52,391 --> 00:20:56,620
We can be pulled out at the summation.
Am I

303
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:01,300
the I irrelative summed
over all the pockets.

304
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,030
M I v I relative is the
momentum of particle.

305
00:21:08,031 --> 00:21:12,890
I I seen by this coal moving observer
who was moving with the center of mass.

306
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,310
So this term is really some over,

307
00:21:16,311 --> 00:21:18,770
I have the individual moment of the party,

308
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,440
but you could go back to your notes.

309
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:26,720
You'll find the some of the moment of
all the particles is the momentum of the

310
00:21:26,721 --> 00:21:27,620
center of mass,

311
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:36,910
but there's the moment I'm at the center
of mass as measured by a person called

312
00:21:36,911 --> 00:21:41,050
moving with the center of mass. What
will that person get? Will you get zero?

313
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:44,890
That's the same trick as before.
For that reason,

314
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:49,540
the Spanish is so don't say it to me. How
can I say central mass momentum a zero.

315
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:53,650
We know the center of mass is moving but
that is from the vantage of this person

316
00:21:53,651 --> 00:21:56,980
here. But if you go and ride
with the center of mass,

317
00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:01,390
this is how you would compute the momentum
of the center of mass by looking at

318
00:22:01,391 --> 00:22:05,500
the moment of the fragments as seen
by you, they better add up to zero.

319
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:09,580
What it means is if there are two
masters moving at different velocities,

320
00:22:09,581 --> 00:22:10,420
the only two of them,

321
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:14,020
if you go to the center of mass
and right with the center of mass,

322
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:17,120
whatever momentum one guy has other
will have the opposite moment.

323
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:23,020
So the momentum office system will appear
to be zero as seen by the central mass.

324
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:26,530
Okay.
That for here is the result,

325
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:31,300
the Kennedy Energy of a collection of
masses is the kinetic energy that you can

326
00:22:31,301 --> 00:22:35,340
associate with the center of mass
motion plus candidate energy relative to

327
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:40,150
center of mass, but I just
call it k, let's do better.

328
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:44,160
Understood is willing to at the
center of mass, this is just a,

329
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:48,490
it's true no matter what I'm talking
about. Collection of loosely moving,

330
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,590
loosely connected particles,

331
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:54,700
but now I play it to the case where
these particles form a rigid body.

332
00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:01,340
Think about it now, so it's not a swarm
of bees that all connected better.

333
00:23:01,341 --> 00:23:05,930
He did Raj, so they form a
rigid complex. In that case,

334
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:10,940
what motion is allowed if you
ride with the center of mass,

335
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:15,620
think about it. What
motion can you have? Yes,

336
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:21,320
it's the rotational, but you can be
more specific rotation about which point

337
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:26,450
and was that a good guesser
or was that a reason for that?

338
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:34,010
You're moving relative to the center
of this is probably you'll be waiting.

339
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:35,570
Okay.

340
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:37,180
Yeah.
Let me repeat what he said.

341
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:43,050
If you're writing with the rigid body and
you are sitting wherever the center of

342
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:49,180
mass city and the only emotion allowed
for you is the rotation around the center

343
00:23:50,271 --> 00:23:54,350
of mass. Because if it does not,
I don't want the center of mass,

344
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:58,520
then the central mass, we'll be moving
relative to the axis of rotation,

345
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,840
but that's not allowed because according
to the center of mass is not moving.

346
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:04,123
Therefore,

347
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:08,180
any rotation that takes place must be
around an axis passing through the central

348
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:12,470
mass. In that case, we know
what the kinetic energy is.

349
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:17,560
There's one half MV squared plus one
half I central mass and I guess squared,

350
00:24:18,901 --> 00:24:21,650
but Omegas, whatever the angular
velocities at that moment.

351
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:28,780
So this is the statement that the Kennedy
Energy is the summer of two times a

352
00:24:29,841 --> 00:24:32,540
translation part and the rotational part

353
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:36,420
provided,
uh,

354
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:41,350
you separated as the kinetic energy of
translation off the center of mass and

355
00:24:41,351 --> 00:24:43,030
rotation relate to percent of the mass.

356
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:51,040
It's a bit of useful result because so
far what we did is in the early part of

357
00:24:51,681 --> 00:24:56,330
the course we took bodies.
We just translate that point.

358
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:58,430
Particles.
They have a massive velocity.

359
00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:02,840
We got used to one half MV squared
as the answer. Last lecture.

360
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:05,690
We took a rigid body which
has a size and a ship.

361
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:07,880
We nailed one part of it so it could move,

362
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:12,020
so all it could do was rotate around the
point and we learned that the energy of

363
00:25:12,021 --> 00:25:15,950
rotation, I've written somewhere
there, there's one half Iomega Square,

364
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:21,650
but in reality a body can translate and
rotate to anything you wanted. The air,

365
00:25:21,651 --> 00:25:24,530
it'll spin or move and so rotate.

366
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:30,230
Then the kinetic energy
of that complicated motion
remarkably is the sum of two

367
00:25:30,231 --> 00:25:33,110
terms. One, you ignore all the wobbling,

368
00:25:33,111 --> 00:25:37,190
just zero in on the center of mass treated
like a point and associate and energy

369
00:25:37,191 --> 00:25:42,170
with its motion. Then think of the
rotation around the center of mass,

370
00:25:42,171 --> 00:25:45,530
which is all that is allowed to
that observer and add that energy

371
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:49,890
maybe for the mortar
mathematically minded people.

372
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:52,920
What is interesting is if you
take a plus B whole square,

373
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:57,270
there's an term terminal B squared
term and they told you long back not to

374
00:25:57,271 --> 00:26:01,410
forget the two ab turn.
The Crosstrek practice across.

375
00:26:01,411 --> 00:26:05,070
Jim always vanishes both in that
derivation. In this derivation,

376
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:08,460
it has to do with the fact that the point
that I'm talking about is not any old

377
00:26:08,461 --> 00:26:12,750
point but the center of mass. So long
ago when you learn about center of mass,

378
00:26:12,751 --> 00:26:16,470
you say, why did people think of this
notion? You can see it repeatedly.

379
00:26:16,471 --> 00:26:20,460
It's a very powerful notion that if
you want to study at a dead body,

380
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:23,040
if you want to pick any one
point that you want to focus on,

381
00:26:23,041 --> 00:26:25,650
it's gotta be central mass.
Yes, this, this problem.

382
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,760
Ignoring the effects of gravity.

383
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:33,270
No,
this is a kinematic,

384
00:26:33,271 --> 00:26:37,320
that statement that doesn't require
that the particles are not subject to

385
00:26:37,321 --> 00:26:40,160
gravitational force.
They can be subject to any force,

386
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:42,930
external forces and internal forces.
Whatever you,

387
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:46,560
all I've done is given instance,
take a snapshot,

388
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:49,290
dig the Kinetic Energy and
write it in a different way.

389
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:54,240
Take the candidate going to be seen by
a static observer and rewrite it as seen

390
00:26:54,241 --> 00:26:57,040
by an observer moving
with the central mass.

391
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:03,000
So I'm going to play this to a simple
problem so you can get a feeling for this.

392
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:05,250
That's simple problem is going to be

393
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:10,060
a
disc.

394
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:15,930
You can think of the problem as
either a disk art as a cylinder.

395
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:19,680
A cylinder is just a disc
with a certain thickness,

396
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:25,110
so discuss like a coin and the is a stack
of coins or the moment of inertia for

397
00:27:25,111 --> 00:27:28,290
the disc or the cylinder is the same.
Do you guys understand that?

398
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:31,380
If it took one coin it's
got Mr squared over two.

399
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:35,010
Let me put a second coin on top of it
and rotate them through the same axes

400
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:38,820
whether there's Mr squared over two for
this guy plus Mr squared or two for that

401
00:27:38,821 --> 00:27:42,960
guy it then it's equal to the
total Mrr square four cylinder Rod.

402
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:47,961
At this moment of Venetia is just Mr
squared over two through the center of

403
00:27:48,781 --> 00:27:49,614
mass.

404
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:55,070
Okay, yes, I remember that.

405
00:27:55,550 --> 00:28:00,410
Now let's take this disk which is sitting
now and give it some energy of motion.

406
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:06,770
Think of it as a pilot in a, in a
car, one of the four tires spinning.

407
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:11,180
So there are different things you could
imagine. Lift the car off the ground,

408
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:15,170
you know, and the service station
and you let the tire spin.

409
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:20,220
That is rotational energy
for that.

410
00:28:20,221 --> 00:28:22,320
The answer is one half Iomega Square.

411
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:28,240
That's what we've been doing all of last
time. But let's do something else. Uh,

412
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,590
let the tire hit the ground

413
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:37,270
and cod is going and get say 50 miles
an hour. Then you slammed the brakes.

414
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:42,270
We prevent the tire from Tony.
If you prevent the tire from turning,

415
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:46,060
you lock the brakes. The tire can
still move with a certain velocity.

416
00:28:46,061 --> 00:28:49,620
V which is just the translational
motion of the center of mass.

417
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:53,830
So this is a card with the skidding.

418
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:57,820
This is a card which is either spinning
its wheels are lifted off the ground.

419
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:01,930
They had the two simple kinds of motion.
You can imagine.

420
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:06,010
One is simple translation. There is
notation to worry about the entities.

421
00:29:06,011 --> 00:29:10,000
One half MV squared. Oh that a
simple rotation which we learned.

422
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:13,360
No translation. That candidate
energy of all the little guys,

423
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:18,410
all moving in the tangential direction
is one half I omegas where all right,

424
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:22,990
I'd real car. Both things are
happening in a real car. The tire is

425
00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:28,540
rolling along the ground and also
rotating around the center and also

426
00:29:28,541 --> 00:29:30,520
translating.
It's got both motions.

427
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,940
No,
the two motions,

428
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,860
namely that linear velocity of the
center and the angular velocity.

429
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:43,720
I don't under center in general don't
have to be connected in any way.

430
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:47,980
Suppose you to start your
car on a slippery road.

431
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:50,950
The tire spinning got cars not moving,

432
00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:56,400
so that's Omega equal to not
zero but be equal to zero. Odd.

433
00:29:56,401 --> 00:29:58,540
When the car is moving along,
you're slammed the brake,

434
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:00,940
then you kill the Omega but not the V.

435
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,390
I'm just trying to tell you in general
that are two philosophies that linear

436
00:30:04,391 --> 00:30:08,650
motion to the center and the angular
motion around the center are independent

437
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:14,110
but one is this getting caught in.
One is a car that spinning his wheels,

438
00:30:14,111 --> 00:30:19,030
but I want to talk about the car the way
we like it in a car that's moving the

439
00:30:19,031 --> 00:30:20,140
way we like it.

440
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:25,590
There's a correlation between the angular
velocity and the linear velocity and

441
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:27,790
that is called rolling without slipping.

442
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:31,593
Yeah.

443
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:35,470
That's the term people use.
Admin is rolling without slipping.

444
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:37,570
I think you have an intuitive feeling.

445
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:42,190
If this guy is to roll with are slipping
on the ground, can you see that?

446
00:30:42,191 --> 00:30:46,630
By the time it finishes one full
revolution vendors come over here,

447
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,000
the center would have moved the distance
equals the circumference of that tire,

448
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:55,420
so every part of the
tire patches of ground.

449
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:59,080
Then that comes down to that comes down
and when it goes all the way to this end,

450
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:01,600
you dishonest the finished
one full revolution.

451
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:08,720
For example, if every part of that
circle was colored with some chalk,

452
00:31:08,810 --> 00:31:10,850
then when it finished the full revolution,

453
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:14,810
every part of the circle would have
passed the road and made an impression and

454
00:31:14,811 --> 00:31:17,210
the length of that thing should be
the circumference of the circle.

455
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:20,360
That's when it rolls without slipping.

456
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:24,500
So what does it mean to roll without
slipping? What's the velocity?

457
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:27,170
Let's calculate the velocity
when you roll without slipping,

458
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:32,090
when you'd roll without slipping.
The velocity of the center of mass,

459
00:31:32,091 --> 00:31:37,091
which is always the Nord by B is
equal to two Pi r you might it,

460
00:31:37,341 --> 00:31:39,320
but the time to make one full revolution.

461
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:46,470
But what is two Pi over t oh,
let me write it another way.

462
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:51,040
Is Two pi times the frequency of
revolution because one over time is the

463
00:31:51,041 --> 00:31:54,730
frequency
and two pie.

464
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:58,300
F is the angular frequency
in radiance per second.

465
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:08,300
So here is the connection between
linear velocity and angular velocity.

466
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:12,690
If you're rolling without slipping,
v Equals Omega are

467
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:22,260
all right. So in general
would be an Omega independent,

468
00:32:22,261 --> 00:32:25,080
but rolling without slipping
refers to a particular situation.

469
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:32,410
No. In that case, that's
fine. The kinetic energy of

470
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:37,720
an automobile tire that's rolling
without slipping. So what are,

471
00:32:37,721 --> 00:32:42,721
what do I want to get the candidate energy
is one half M v squared plus one half

472
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:48,920
I omega squared.
That's always true.

473
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:52,340
I is always I to the center of mass,

474
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:58,540
but now I'm going to use the fact that
it is one half m B squared plus one over

475
00:33:00,981 --> 00:33:05,981
two m r squared over
two we'll make a square.

476
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:09,050
Not done anything different,

477
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,610
but now we must remember that Omega are,

478
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:19,100
here's the velocity of the car.
So if I do that,

479
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:22,010
I find going back to this corner here,

480
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,000
k equals one half MV squared.

481
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,450
That's one fort Mv Square.

482
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:37,210
So you can write it as one half
times the m over to the square.

483
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:46,370
So the kinetic energy of the rotating
tire is not just one half MV squared.

484
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:48,170
If it's rolling without slipping,

485
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:53,020
it's incumbent on the tire to have some
rotational energy that's correlated with

486
00:33:53,021 --> 00:33:56,960
this translational energy.
So the total energy will be this.

487
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:03,020
But I'm going to write this in a different
way. Let me replace V by Omega are.

488
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:08,200
So I can write it as one half by
m m m over two times r square.

489
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:13,460
Make a square.

490
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:21,060
And that means it's equal to one half
m r squared plus one half amrs square.

491
00:34:24,890 --> 00:34:29,000
I'm still Omega Square.
There's a lot of rewriting.

492
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:30,620
So if you don't follow all the details,

493
00:34:30,621 --> 00:34:34,250
now you can go back and check
the inflammadry at steps.

494
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:38,680
But what do you notice about this formula?
I

495
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:46,070
want you to think about what the
formula such as to suggest anything.

496
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:50,330
The stuff in the brackets.
Yes, yes you, yeah.

497
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:54,110
What do you see in the brackets

498
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:04,850
that is [inaudible] we got
the more specific than just
saying hi. That's correct.

499
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:07,460
So this term is a moment
of finish up this,

500
00:35:07,461 --> 00:35:10,340
pick the center of mass
and this looks like

501
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:12,893
walking up.

502
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:15,090
Yeah. Somebody in the last year. Yes.

503
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:16,383
One minute.

504
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:23,680
Uh, not hollow ring, but I'm
having something else in mind. Yes.

505
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:28,563
Right.

506
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:29,780
Let me repeat what he said.

507
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:35,660
If you ask me what's the moment of
inertia of the tire with respect to this

508
00:35:35,661 --> 00:35:38,740
point,
what will you do?

509
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:42,240
You'll do the paddle Alexis
theater on the parallel axis data.

510
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:44,470
We'll give you mr squared
over two for the moment.

511
00:35:44,471 --> 00:35:47,620
It finishes with the center
and an extra MD squared,

512
00:35:47,621 --> 00:35:49,810
which now becomes m r squared.

513
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:54,300
So this is really

514
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:01,050
one half I watch that we call it
road or something. It's up to you.

515
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:02,340
You can call it whatever you like.

516
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:05,940
Here's the moment of inertia with respect
to this point of contact on the road.

517
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:14,940
Well, you have to think about the
result. It's a very interesting result.

518
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:20,630
It is telling you the entire energy off
this tire is as though it is rotating.

519
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:29,190
I don't disappoint with angular
velocity, Omega, forget translation.

520
00:36:29,191 --> 00:36:31,260
It just a pure rotation around this point.

521
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:34,920
I vendor just rotating around the point,

522
00:36:34,921 --> 00:36:39,921
it means that point cannot be moving
and I will now convince you that that is

523
00:36:39,961 --> 00:36:43,440
actually true if you
look at your car tire.

524
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:45,170
Okay.

525
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:47,660
How fastest are the different
parts of the tire moving?

526
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:51,860
The car has a whole is moving at a speed B

527
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:58,630
on top of this, the tightest spinning. So
if you take a point here, would that be,

528
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:04,230
you got to add an extra
tangential velocity which is
v Plus Omega are that just

529
00:37:04,271 --> 00:37:05,290
happens to be,
to me,

530
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:11,800
if he'd come to the bottom part of it as
seen by the car is moving backwards at

531
00:37:11,801 --> 00:37:15,670
this velocity minus v. After that,
the speed of the car you get zero.

532
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:17,830
In other words,

533
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:21,130
the front at the top of the tire is
moving along with the car at the same

534
00:37:21,131 --> 00:37:22,120
velocity of the center.

535
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:26,080
The bottom of the tightest
is moving opposite to the
car at the same velocity of

536
00:37:26,081 --> 00:37:28,730
the center. So it's really the last
year seen by the ground as you.

537
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:34,510
This is a very surprising result.
A car going past you at 200 miles an hour.

538
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:39,040
That is that part of the car that a
zero velocity, the lift off the ground,

539
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:44,320
it's not obvious that zooming caught as
one part of it. That's not moving at all.

540
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:49,030
It's not the same part.
Otherwise a card really is not moving.

541
00:37:49,031 --> 00:37:50,200
But at every instance,

542
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:54,670
the part of the tire that is
the ground has zero velocity.

543
00:37:56,950 --> 00:38:00,850
I hope you understand why it's a
cancellation of the central portion of the

544
00:38:00,851 --> 00:38:03,220
overall motion with the rotational motion.

545
00:38:03,221 --> 00:38:07,120
You can see the rotational motion on
the top adds to the speed of the car

546
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:09,940
rotational motion in the bottom,
subtract from the speed of the car.

547
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:14,320
And if you write v Equals Omega are the
two precisely cancer here in double bay.

548
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:16,260
Yeah.

549
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:18,560
So if the bottom point is addressed,

550
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,570
then the only thing that car can
do is to rotate around that point.

551
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:27,070
And that's the reason why the energy comes
out to be purely rotational energy or

552
00:38:27,071 --> 00:38:27,904
on the center.

553
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:33,270
So this is a simple problem
that illustrates all the
things you have learned

554
00:38:33,271 --> 00:38:36,820
today, how to use the parallax theater
and how to do the energy calculation,

555
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,800
how to interpret the energy calculations.

556
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:45,500
But now this is useful for the following
example. Suppose I have a little slope.

557
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:52,070
I release an object from the top and I
asked you how fast is it moving when it

558
00:38:52,171 --> 00:38:53,004
comes here.

559
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:57,750
If it's a point mass
and the heifers is age,

560
00:38:58,530 --> 00:39:02,340
we know from very elementary ideas if it,
if it's a point mass.

561
00:39:02,341 --> 00:39:04,890
So don't quote me on this.
If it's a point mass,

562
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:07,860
I would say MGH has
become one half MV way.

563
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,760
Kennedy potential has become kinetic.

564
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:18,740
But if it is a cylinder rolling without
slipping and it comes here in the center

565
00:39:21,121 --> 00:39:22,620
of mass,
cannot move at this speed

566
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:26,610
because it's gotta be a lower speed.

567
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:31,760
So that the rotational energy
plus translation energy
without blame g h so this

568
00:39:32,191 --> 00:39:34,110
must be equal to the
total Kennedy Kennedy.

569
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:38,040
And I've sold it for you guys to remember
that you have to write three over two

570
00:39:38,041 --> 00:39:41,310
m this were to go back to
whatever was done here,

571
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,470
uh,
here.

572
00:39:46,370 --> 00:39:50,990
So you can see that if you cancel the
mass, you're going to get v squared,

573
00:39:50,991 --> 00:39:53,450
not equal.
The two g h as you normally would,

574
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:56,290
you're going to get
[inaudible] for 30 days,

575
00:39:57,230 --> 00:39:58,790
so it'd be moving somewhat slower.

576
00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:00,850
Then a

577
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:05,930
point mark party.
So if it runs without slipping,

578
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:09,330
then you will be traveling
slower at the foot of the rack.

579
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:18,120
So what did I do? I use the law of
conservation of energy. That's all I did.

580
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:20,430
But in finding the kinetic
energy at the bottom,

581
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:23,790
I was careful to not just
take one half MV squared,

582
00:40:23,850 --> 00:40:25,290
which is the energy of a point particle,

583
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:29,430
but take the kinetic energy
of translation and rotation,

584
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:33,270
which I've done for you here.
That's the kinetic and the plan selection.

585
00:40:33,271 --> 00:40:35,730
That's the kinetic energy of rotation.
By the way,

586
00:40:36,330 --> 00:40:40,560
don't make the mistake of thinking it
is three 40 MV squared for everything.

587
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:45,650
It is three 40 Mba squared for a cylinder,
if which is this it or something.

588
00:40:45,651 --> 00:40:47,540
You got to add a different thing,

589
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:52,160
but every time you will have to find a
moment of an issue you do rotation and

590
00:40:52,161 --> 00:40:54,920
add to the energy of the rotation
at the energy of translation.

591
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:02,060
You follow that for each body it'll
have a different moment of furniture,

592
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:04,780
so you've got to use in the
place at one half MV squared.

593
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:09,130
Let me just tell you for a sphere,
if this was a sphere, not a disc,

594
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:12,580
they all look the same, but if it's
a sphere, this one half Mv Square,

595
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:15,610
I think it's two fifth Mr Square,

596
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:21,760
the different number, but then it's
all Mr squared times some number.

597
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:25,420
So you can take the artist squared
out of this and turn it into v Square.

598
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:27,850
So you will find instead of just the mass,

599
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:31,900
you'll get some multiple of the mass
entering here in the Kennedy Energy and to

600
00:41:31,901 --> 00:41:35,390
the extent that's bigger than the mass,
the velocity will be that much slower.

601
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:41,270
So that are all cancer variants you can
have. Here's a variation of this theme.

602
00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:43,880
You remember that when you
want to do the loop, the loop,

603
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:48,080
if you release a block
from here at the top,

604
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:53,540
I have shown you many times velocity
squared has to be bigger than or equal to

605
00:41:53,541 --> 00:41:57,800
argue. That's the make sure it
doesn't just fall down to the track.

606
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:01,490
That's the critical time at with
the track is exerting zero force.

607
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:04,880
If you went faster than that, it'll push
you down and everything would be fine.

608
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:10,170
Do you went slower than that? You will
fall down. Okay, but now it's supposed to,

609
00:42:10,171 --> 00:42:11,600
it's not a point mass,

610
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:16,630
but a object like it coin on a
disk rolling with our slipping.

611
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:23,050
It is still true. Be Square at least has
to be equal to RG, but to find the visa,

612
00:42:23,051 --> 00:42:27,830
wait here you will use
the law of conservation of
energy. That's all just fine.

613
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:33,370
The potential energy here will be empty
times two are working channel energy.

614
00:42:34,401 --> 00:42:37,530
Here is AMG at times are yes,

615
00:42:37,531 --> 00:42:41,330
don't make the mistake of saying the
kinetic energy is one half MV squared and

616
00:42:41,331 --> 00:42:45,800
put basically medical RG. That would be
wrong. This am here. Maybe become three,

617
00:42:45,801 --> 00:42:48,320
four that nine seventh or
whatever it is for that body.

618
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:54,700
So it's the same idea but you can add
more and more ideas and put them together

619
00:42:54,701 --> 00:42:56,050
and make a more interesting problem.

620
00:42:56,970 --> 00:43:01,780
But if I were to summarize in one sentence
what I've told you all of this time,

621
00:43:02,530 --> 00:43:04,900
you said when rigid bodies move,

622
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:08,260
they have a translational and
rotational energy in general,

623
00:43:08,261 --> 00:43:09,400
they are independent numbers,

624
00:43:09,850 --> 00:43:13,570
but when you have a rolling
without slipping the angular
velocity of the linear

625
00:43:13,571 --> 00:43:14,404
velocity,

626
00:43:14,530 --> 00:43:19,530
I've connected in this fashion so it's
not surprising that the total energy has

627
00:43:19,661 --> 00:43:22,780
got a contribution from both
which you can read, right?

628
00:43:22,790 --> 00:43:25,870
Eight and in terms of the angular
velocity are the linear velocity.

629
00:43:26,090 --> 00:43:28,120
In other words,
if I don't how fast the wheel is spinning,

630
00:43:28,330 --> 00:43:30,130
I can tell you how fast the car is moving.

631
00:43:30,490 --> 00:43:32,200
If I tell you how fast the car is moving,

632
00:43:32,470 --> 00:43:35,700
I inaugurated with the wheels are
spinning, provided is not skidding.

633
00:43:36,210 --> 00:43:37,960
If it's getting,
these bets are off.

634
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:41,741
All right,

635
00:43:41,741 --> 00:43:46,741
so now we continue with this saga of
rotations and let me remind you where we

636
00:43:49,571 --> 00:43:51,940
stand.
When I did F equals,

637
00:43:51,941 --> 00:43:56,860
I may after telling you a little bit
about how mass is measured and everybody

638
00:43:56,861 --> 00:43:58,870
knew who acceleration measured,
what did we do?

639
00:44:00,050 --> 00:44:03,340
The first took a bunch of problems where
some forces that are acting on a body,

640
00:44:03,341 --> 00:44:05,410
maybe something is pulling,
something is pushing,

641
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:07,840
then learn how to find the acceleration.

642
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,340
Then uh,

643
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:16,390
I took other cases where there are many
bodies exerting a mutual force on each

644
00:44:16,391 --> 00:44:20,210
other than if that had no external forces.
We saw the turtle momentum.

645
00:44:20,211 --> 00:44:21,310
Other system is concerned.

646
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:26,980
They are going to do analogous things
with our new found equation at Tao week

647
00:44:27,041 --> 00:44:31,380
was I alpha.
You want to get used to more?

648
00:44:31,890 --> 00:44:33,860
That's all.
That's all I'm going to do from now on.

649
00:44:35,550 --> 00:44:37,650
I already told you in the beginning,
uh,

650
00:44:37,651 --> 00:44:41,190
that new thing you learned was topic
was I Alpha and we are going to use it.

651
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:47,880
So let's take various
situations where we can do this.

652
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:51,590
So let me take a simple example or
you can make up your own problem.

653
00:44:51,610 --> 00:44:55,670
It doesn't matter, but get
practice. One possibility is uh,

654
00:44:55,900 --> 00:45:00,810
it is a disk like a merry go round.
It's sitting still.

655
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:05,100
He's got a massive, got it radius
and I wound up play a torque.

656
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:08,880
So one way to play the Torque is
the way kids do. You know you,

657
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:12,240
you grabbed the sandy and you run
with it on the site and as you run it,

658
00:45:12,241 --> 00:45:13,074
it picks up speed.

659
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:18,390
But what you're trying to do is I play a
tangential force as long as you can and

660
00:45:18,391 --> 00:45:21,270
the force times the distance will turn
into a target and that will produce

661
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:22,380
angular acceleration.

662
00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:27,330
Another way to do that if you're really
high tech is to buy yourself a rocket.

663
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:33,120
It's got some flames coming here.
Then if you just put one rocket,

664
00:45:34,170 --> 00:45:37,500
the Dane did, what do you think the
danger is? Just put one of these rockets.

665
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:39,773
Okay.

666
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:43,840
You know what the problem may be?
Certainly exerted torque. Yes.

667
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:46,473
Yeah,
because look,

668
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:50,740
that will be translational motion left
to itself because that is a force and

669
00:45:50,741 --> 00:45:54,130
ethical Timei is not gone away just
because we are in chapter 11 that's still

670
00:45:54,131 --> 00:45:57,880
true.
So what will happen is this pivot point,

671
00:45:57,881 --> 00:45:59,530
it's trying to hold the
merry go round in place.

672
00:45:59,531 --> 00:46:02,500
You're putting a lot of force
on it because it'll try to move.

673
00:46:02,530 --> 00:46:04,450
It has to counter the
force at every instance.

674
00:46:05,620 --> 00:46:07,570
As long as the merry go
round doesn't fly off.

675
00:46:07,571 --> 00:46:11,220
What'll happen is if the rockets
pushing and emitting gas at this way and

676
00:46:11,221 --> 00:46:12,430
applying a force that way,

677
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:16,150
the pivotal level and opposite force
and as the rocket goes there ill play an

678
00:46:16,151 --> 00:46:18,820
opposite force the other
direction but this bad,

679
00:46:18,821 --> 00:46:23,260
this pivot is unwanted agony.
What you do is you get a second rocket.

680
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:24,850
Similar thrust,

681
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:30,160
put a diamond totally opposite and
habits flames going out like this.

682
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:37,150
So when you buy a rocket they will tell
you this rocket has the thrust of so

683
00:46:37,151 --> 00:46:39,310
many uh newtons.

684
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:43,420
That's the force it will
exert by everything the gas.

685
00:46:43,450 --> 00:46:46,600
So if it got a certain trust f here,

686
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:51,100
get another rocket at the same stress
deaf here did ADSL is are the torque

687
00:46:51,110 --> 00:46:54,370
you're applying is an f
times r time sign of 90,

688
00:46:54,430 --> 00:46:58,960
which is one and another f names are
from the other guy and the two parks.

689
00:46:58,961 --> 00:47:03,340
That additive, that'd be the
torque. Then the rest is very easy.

690
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:05,500
What's the angle?
That acceleration of this guy?

691
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:08,770
It is to have our [inaudible]
by the moment of finish. Yeah.

692
00:47:08,771 --> 00:47:12,340
Which in this case is Mr squared over two.
If it's a disc,

693
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:15,020
yeah.

694
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:16,850
What if they put some passengers on this?

695
00:47:17,390 --> 00:47:21,780
Supposed to put one loan
passenger here, officer mass. Uh,

696
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:26,000
let me call it a little less
then what happens?

697
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:30,860
You liked the guests? Yep. Yeah.

698
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:35,593
Right,

699
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:38,390
right.
So what should add to the denominator?

700
00:47:38,830 --> 00:47:41,690
Uh,
yes.

701
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:48,290
All right. That sounds to connect. Uh, so
my picked it is wrong. Saudi for this one.

702
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:53,680
This r should be capital r and
let's use for this mass here.

703
00:47:53,930 --> 00:47:58,370
Small are small. Honors. Square
capitalized is the symbol.

704
00:47:58,820 --> 00:48:02,240
I wanted to use Florida. Oh
my God, this is a nightmare.

705
00:48:02,990 --> 00:48:07,280
I have to change it in so many places.
I guess once I started down this road,

706
00:48:08,330 --> 00:48:11,930
I have to do that. Okay.
Look, it's very natural.

707
00:48:11,931 --> 00:48:16,100
That big [inaudible] is the disc radius
and small artists. Some point in sight,

708
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:19,940
but I did, I was not planning to
put this guy in the platforms.

709
00:48:19,941 --> 00:48:24,710
I just used the random symbol that
everybody understand. Now for the moment,

710
00:48:24,711 --> 00:48:28,140
computation is the radius of the
disk for the moment of inertia up.

711
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:31,370
The little person we put on
this little r squared. Okay,

712
00:48:31,371 --> 00:48:34,660
so that's simplest example
of using [inaudible].

713
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:39,410
Once the rockets start burning,
you got this alpha.

714
00:48:40,070 --> 00:48:44,600
I can ask you things like how many
degrees has rotated after 19 seconds.

715
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:50,390
Then you should know what to do.
Data is stayed or not, plus Omega,

716
00:48:50,391 --> 00:48:54,920
not t plus one half alpha, t square
data and art. You can choose to be zero.

717
00:48:55,370 --> 00:48:58,700
Initial angle of velocity was zero,
just one half Alpha t squared,

718
00:48:58,701 --> 00:48:59,720
but alpha is this.

719
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:04,250
You put the number of seconds they gave
you that will tell you how many ang

720
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:08,870
degrees it as rotated by
that time. If they say, how
many revolutions has it made,

721
00:49:09,290 --> 00:49:10,160
then what will you do?

722
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:16,290
Yes. Any idea? Yup.

723
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:21,750
Divided by two Pi to Pi is
one full revolution. These
are things you must know.

724
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:26,760
Okay. Then if I say, what's the
angle of velocity after 36 seconds,

725
00:49:26,761 --> 00:49:30,480
whether it's Alpha Times 36
these are simple problems,

726
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:35,310
so now I'm going to do a slightly
more complicated problems.

727
00:49:36,130 --> 00:49:41,130
Yet it's the first complication you can
have that is the pulley and there is a

728
00:49:43,741 --> 00:49:48,660
mass. I better get everything
right here. This is,

729
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:53,640
let's call it a little m.
Let's call that radius r and mass began

730
00:49:55,530 --> 00:49:59,760
and I just let go of the mass and the
question is what's the acceleration of

731
00:49:59,761 --> 00:50:00,594
this mass?

732
00:50:05,610 --> 00:50:08,580
So this is a combination of
rotational problems and translation,

733
00:50:08,581 --> 00:50:10,800
the masters translating the police,
rotating.

734
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:16,080
And the point is what's the
acceleration of this mass?

735
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:22,800
So we know from the old days that if you
want to find what's happening, the mass,

736
00:50:22,801 --> 00:50:27,801
you should draw free body diagram with a
downward force mg and some pension t on

737
00:50:28,291 --> 00:50:29,124
the road.

738
00:50:29,310 --> 00:50:30,143
Okay.

739
00:50:32,190 --> 00:50:34,710
Then you must also drive free
body diagram for the pulley.

740
00:50:37,270 --> 00:50:39,220
When you look at the free
body diagram for the pulley,

741
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:42,490
I have a tension t acting down here.

742
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:47,440
How about run all the forces on this?
Yup.

743
00:50:50,730 --> 00:50:55,570
Right? So this pivot point is
going to be playing some forces.

744
00:50:56,320 --> 00:51:00,430
Basically what it has to do is to overcome
the weight of this mass and overcome

745
00:51:00,431 --> 00:51:03,970
this tension t but I'm not
going to bother to write that.

746
00:51:05,050 --> 00:51:08,620
I'll tell you why. So this
is an incomplete picture.
That is something else here.

747
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:13,450
But I won't pay any attention
to it because I'm going
to use torque called the I

748
00:51:13,450 --> 00:51:17,500
Alpha and I'm going to take the torque
through the center and this is something

749
00:51:17,501 --> 00:51:18,880
they'll come over and over again.

750
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:23,890
You could take a torque through a certain
point. The forces acting to that point,

751
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:28,190
they don't get the contribute because
in the formula for Torque fr sign,

752
00:51:28,191 --> 00:51:31,000
Tara are managers and that
forces don't do anything.

753
00:51:31,150 --> 00:51:34,120
That's where I don't pay any
attention to what the pivot is doing.

754
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:40,560
This t is trying to rotate it this way
and I know that p times r is the torque

755
00:51:41,170 --> 00:51:45,160
that's going to be Amr square
or Mr Square over two times.

756
00:51:45,161 --> 00:51:49,660
Alpha Alpha is the angular
acceleration of this guy.

757
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:52,960
For the mass it is AMG

758
00:51:55,150 --> 00:51:57,730
minus t equals m a

759
00:52:02,810 --> 00:52:05,990
so let's go and cancel
one part of our here

760
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:12,980
but we seem to have two unknowns.
This problem, the tension t,

761
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:14,750
sorry,
three unknowns,

762
00:52:14,810 --> 00:52:19,810
the acceleration a and the tangential
angular acceleration Alpha of the pulley.

763
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:25,370
But here is where you do the trick you
that even with the two masses they are

764
00:52:25,371 --> 00:52:29,570
not independent accelerations because if
this point has an angular acceleration

765
00:52:29,571 --> 00:52:30,404
alpha,

766
00:52:30,590 --> 00:52:34,720
you can see that point as a tangential
acceleration of our times alpha.

767
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:39,980
That has to be the acceleration of this
mass also because the rope is being

768
00:52:40,850 --> 00:52:45,370
given out at a certain rate and that's
the same. So the mass can go one.

769
00:52:45,371 --> 00:52:49,160
It's only if the pulley turns
by a corresponding amount
to release one more inch.

770
00:52:49,790 --> 00:52:53,000
So the tangents of velocity of the point
here, this is the last year of the mass.

771
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:56,420
The acceleration of that contact
point is the acceleration of this.

772
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:02,200
Therefore we have to use the fact that
a equal to our alpha is really what I

773
00:53:03,621 --> 00:53:08,390
call a tangential in the first lecture.
So if you do that,

774
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:11,540
you can see that this art,
Pam's Alpha is just a,

775
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:17,150
this combination becomes a,
now I'm ready to add these two equations,

776
00:53:17,450 --> 00:53:22,450
minus d and plastic cancel giving me
mg equals n times m plus m over too,

777
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:33,960
so we can get the acceleration.

778
00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:39,140
The acceleration is g and you
might add by m plus m over too.

779
00:53:46,650 --> 00:53:49,740
So does it make sense when you
get a calculation like this,

780
00:53:49,741 --> 00:53:52,000
you can test in many ways.
Firstly,

781
00:53:52,030 --> 00:53:56,560
the pulley is massless capital
and vanishes. Forget it.

782
00:53:56,580 --> 00:53:59,820
Downstairs. Cancer, little lamb, little
lamb, and you get eight with, gee,

783
00:53:59,821 --> 00:54:03,030
that's the correct answer.
Just falling down freely.

784
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:12,170
No, I'm going to subject it
to another stringent test

785
00:54:13,930 --> 00:54:17,060
was to ask you
some points.

786
00:54:17,061 --> 00:54:19,400
It got a distance eights
through which it can fall.

787
00:54:20,870 --> 00:54:23,540
How fast is that block moving
when it hits the ground?

788
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:26,240
Just before it hits the ground.
Watch the velocity.

789
00:54:28,970 --> 00:54:32,870
So you have to think about what
ideas you will invoke to do that.

790
00:54:36,110 --> 00:54:38,540
Yes. The acceleration
constant. First of all,

791
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:44,510
yes. Debbie, when the back said yes,

792
00:54:44,540 --> 00:54:48,260
anybody know if which is constant
[inaudible] how many people think it's

793
00:54:48,261 --> 00:54:52,510
constant? Okay. See,

794
00:54:53,170 --> 00:54:54,580
I don't know what you guys are thinking.

795
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:59,050
So I am always worried
whether your silence means
no idea what I'm saying. God,

796
00:54:59,051 --> 00:54:59,651
it's so obvious.

797
00:54:59,651 --> 00:55:02,860
You don't want to tell me that's going
to happen in a class with a hundred

798
00:55:02,861 --> 00:55:06,280
people. That is this video. Unfortunate.
You'll be locked nicer if five,

799
00:55:06,460 --> 00:55:09,460
10 people than I can stop
and ask you to one, a few.

800
00:55:09,461 --> 00:55:13,360
But I asked you if you don't fall as
something you got to tell me. Okay.

801
00:55:13,361 --> 00:55:14,440
Otherwise I just don't know.

802
00:55:15,850 --> 00:55:19,630
So if a is constant and they use a
lot of you seem to agree is constant,

803
00:55:19,930 --> 00:55:24,130
then you go back to lecture number zero.
What did we find?

804
00:55:24,510 --> 00:55:29,510
We Square is B Zero Square with the zero
plus to a times the distance traveled,

805
00:55:32,530 --> 00:55:33,880
which in our case would be h.

806
00:55:34,850 --> 00:55:37,990
So let's put that in too.

807
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:43,240
Eh is this number here and
plus m over two times eight.

808
00:55:46,730 --> 00:55:51,730
So I'm going to write it in the very
suggestive language as to over m plus m

809
00:55:53,271 --> 00:55:55,160
over two times.

810
00:55:55,161 --> 00:55:58,520
Aim G H O.
Anyway,

811
00:55:58,521 --> 00:56:00,860
that's the square of the velocity
when the blockage, the ground.

812
00:56:02,330 --> 00:56:06,080
So what do you think I'm trying
to test? No, what's my goal?

813
00:56:06,950 --> 00:56:08,660
Any idea where I'm going with this?

814
00:56:10,660 --> 00:56:13,930
Yep.
Because it's moving slower.

815
00:56:13,931 --> 00:56:16,990
When it hits the ground
and it has less energy,

816
00:56:16,991 --> 00:56:20,820
that means that energy is
stored in rotation. Okay.

817
00:56:21,030 --> 00:56:23,040
That is correct.
But if I want to test,

818
00:56:23,650 --> 00:56:25,660
if I wanted to subject
his answer to a test,

819
00:56:26,230 --> 00:56:27,970
what test do you think I can apply here?

820
00:56:29,890 --> 00:56:31,660
This has to meet a certain requirement.

821
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:33,593
Yep.

822
00:56:35,620 --> 00:56:39,280
I want to show that the energy is
conserved. That is no friction,

823
00:56:39,670 --> 00:56:43,000
nothing in this problem.
So if you want to say energy is conserved,

824
00:56:43,420 --> 00:56:45,790
we know what we want. We want, MGH

825
00:56:47,410 --> 00:56:51,430
has to be the kinetic energy
of all these objects, right?

826
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:53,920
So go to my answer here.
The same g,

827
00:56:53,921 --> 00:56:58,660
H let's send all the other stuff to
the left hand side. If I do that,

828
00:56:59,020 --> 00:56:59,853
I get

829
00:57:01,180 --> 00:57:06,180
em over to B squared plus one half
m over to B square equals MGH.

830
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:16,030
All I've done guys is to transfer
this fellow to the other side.

831
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:21,250
Well, MDH is wonderful. That's
my initial potential energy.

832
00:57:21,251 --> 00:57:23,170
There is no kinetic energy.
Nobody was moving.

833
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:26,230
This is clearly the
kinetic energy of the mass.

834
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:30,550
And last thing is is is the
kinetic energy of the pulley.

835
00:57:31,090 --> 00:57:34,050
I think by now you recognize this
is the kinetic energy of the pulley.

836
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:36,010
If you're not convinced,

837
00:57:36,250 --> 00:57:41,250
I can be places v by Omega are and bring
the r squared in here and write this

838
00:57:42,281 --> 00:57:46,300
last term as one half
r square omega squared,

839
00:57:47,710 --> 00:57:49,150
which is the kinetic energy of the,

840
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:52,980
so you've got to understand the linear
velocity of the mass and the angular

841
00:57:52,990 --> 00:57:53,380
velocity.

842
00:57:53,380 --> 00:57:57,310
The pulley are connected and the
connection factor is always our artists,

843
00:57:57,311 --> 00:58:00,820
the number that connects linear
to angular quantity. So indeed,

844
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:06,100
this answer satisfies the law
of conservation of energy.
That's a very good test.

845
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:11,800
Now you can have
variations of this problem.

846
00:58:11,801 --> 00:58:13,510
I don't want to do too many variations.
In fact,

847
00:58:13,511 --> 00:58:15,880
I'm just going to draw it in the corner
of the board and I don't feel like

848
00:58:15,881 --> 00:58:20,650
pursuing it because there is a limit to
how many things can be done in the class.

849
00:58:20,651 --> 00:58:23,770
So here is a pulley and here to say a mass

850
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:28,930
and you guys can work out the
acceleration of the mass downhill.

851
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:32,710
It's the same story that I did here.
Okay.

852
00:58:33,580 --> 00:58:35,560
You got to draw the free
body diagram of the mass.

853
00:58:35,561 --> 00:58:39,040
You're going to draw the free body
diagram of the pulley and the are going to

854
00:58:39,041 --> 00:58:40,960
say the net force on this,

855
00:58:40,990 --> 00:58:44,350
bringing it down with the network and
this is turning it and you'll realize that

856
00:58:44,351 --> 00:58:46,840
the a of this and the Alpha
of this are not independent,

857
00:58:47,260 --> 00:58:50,470
but that the a of the block is
related to the alpha of the pulley.

858
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:52,690
By this factor,
then you'll be home.

859
00:58:54,650 --> 00:58:55,670
Things will just work out.

860
00:58:58,520 --> 00:59:00,460
I will of course depend on this angle.
Tatoe

861
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:08,340
suppose you did the calculation and
you wanted to subject that to a test.

862
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:11,473
What can you do?

863
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:17,213
Yep.

864
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,720
[inaudible]

865
00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:26,270
uh,
that is no friction.

866
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:29,420
So what you're saying is you can use
the law of conservation of energy.

867
00:59:29,810 --> 00:59:31,670
For example,
if there's dropped a certain height,

868
00:59:31,671 --> 00:59:33,350
eight from that height to the ground,

869
00:59:33,950 --> 00:59:37,670
your answers should satisfy the condition
that MGH was equal to the Kennedy

870
00:59:37,671 --> 00:59:40,570
energy of the mass and the police. At
the end of the day, you're answerable,

871
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:41,473
satisfying.

872
00:59:42,390 --> 00:59:46,250
Other thing you can do is if this
angle theta goes to 90 degrees,

873
00:59:46,490 --> 00:59:50,060
look what happens if data goes
to 90 forget about a block.

874
00:59:50,310 --> 00:59:54,110
It was just falling freely and that's
the previous problem and you can check if

875
00:59:54,111 --> 00:59:56,210
the answer do you get agrees
with the previous rep,

876
00:59:58,100 --> 01:00:02,330
so I'm just teaching you that. It's good
to have constant checks on the problem.

877
01:00:02,331 --> 01:00:04,880
One way to check the calculation
as to go back and do it again.

878
01:00:06,170 --> 01:00:08,020
Most of the time if you
screwed up the first time,

879
01:00:08,021 --> 01:00:12,290
it probably screw up the
second time because one of
the basic rules of nature is

880
01:00:12,291 --> 01:00:15,050
that if you repeat a certain
experiment under the same conditions,

881
01:00:15,051 --> 01:00:18,920
you'd get the same answer. That's why
when I proofread anything at right,

882
01:00:18,921 --> 01:00:20,240
I don't find any mistakes,

883
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:25,070
but my readers are playfully pointing
out this and that type of cause.

884
01:00:25,071 --> 01:00:26,300
We cannot detect those errors.

885
01:00:26,330 --> 01:00:29,960
That's true even for a
scientific calculation because
for some reason you forgot

886
01:00:29,961 --> 01:00:30,890
something the first time,

887
01:00:31,250 --> 01:00:35,330
you will keep making the same mistake
that is known in the businesses chasing

888
01:00:35,331 --> 01:00:38,210
after pie.
In all the calculations we do.

889
01:00:38,870 --> 01:00:42,380
We look at the right answer and
we look at our answer and we take,

890
01:00:42,381 --> 01:00:46,780
the ratio is always 3.14 so we
know somewhere we lost a pipe.

891
01:00:47,570 --> 01:00:51,470
It's called chasing after pie and chasing
after factors of two is roughly how I

892
01:00:51,471 --> 01:00:54,350
spend 80% of my time when
I'm debugging something.

893
01:00:54,950 --> 01:00:58,400
So how do you beat those things
is by all these extreme limits.

894
01:01:00,110 --> 01:01:04,100
That's another thing I want to tell you
with is all of us are partial to working

895
01:01:04,101 --> 01:01:05,990
these things with symbols
and not with numbers.

896
01:01:05,990 --> 01:01:10,190
I think this is a big issue
in introductory physics
that I said resistance to

897
01:01:10,191 --> 01:01:11,240
working with symbols.

898
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:14,990
People want to know what's the mass m
and watch the odd number or let me put

899
01:01:14,991 --> 01:01:19,820
that in. If you put numbers into early,
you cannot test your answer for anything.

900
01:01:19,940 --> 01:01:21,200
In the end he has got a number.

901
01:01:21,710 --> 01:01:23,780
You cannot take the limit
of one particular number,

902
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:26,690
but if you've got a function that
depends on all the parameters,

903
01:01:26,691 --> 01:01:30,350
you can vary them and in some extreme
limit you will know what the answer is.

904
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:34,580
That's why you should be already even
in the exam. That's not a secret.

905
01:01:34,581 --> 01:01:37,550
I will tell you right now,
most of the problems they give you,

906
01:01:37,551 --> 01:01:40,560
we'll work with symbols.
Now,

907
01:01:40,580 --> 01:01:44,180
I don't know why it's harder working
with symbols. For me, just the opposite.

908
01:01:44,510 --> 01:01:47,270
Once they put numbers in,
I don't know what the number stands for.

909
01:01:47,570 --> 01:01:50,990
That is separate call it am or I call it
art and ecology. I know what it stands,

910
01:01:51,790 --> 01:01:53,420
so you guys have to get used to,

911
01:01:54,110 --> 01:01:57,320
even in a homework problem where
numbers were given to you, you know,

912
01:01:57,321 --> 01:02:01,370
block of mass, 46 kilograms
collides with some elephant first.

913
01:02:01,371 --> 01:02:04,970
Call them all one, two, three. Give
the masses, solve the equation,

914
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:09,710
then put the numbers. That's
what I would recommend. Anyway,

915
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:14,930
I think you can see here the advantage
of working with symbols. Okay,

916
01:02:14,931 --> 01:02:19,470
so what I've had done now, I took examples
of topic, but I Alpha in all problems.

917
01:02:19,471 --> 01:02:21,750
I did something,
had a park and it was spinning.

918
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:24,830
The target that came from the rockets are,

919
01:02:24,831 --> 01:02:27,840
it came from the pool of this mass
art from the pool of this mass.

920
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:33,980
Now I'm going to take a subset of
problems in nature where the Torque,

921
01:02:36,930 --> 01:02:39,390
the total torque on a
collection of bodies is zero.

922
01:02:40,950 --> 01:02:43,490
So I'm going to take a
system that in many tarkes,

923
01:02:43,890 --> 01:02:48,890
but the external torque forces outside
the things forming my system is zero.

924
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:52,380
Then you remember when the
external forces vanished,

925
01:02:53,100 --> 01:02:55,950
then the momentum of
the system was the same.

926
01:02:56,130 --> 01:03:00,050
P One plus p two was B one prime
plus p to prime. So he had,

927
01:03:00,051 --> 01:03:05,051
he will find l one plus l two l three any
number of them would it be so in other

928
01:03:07,231 --> 01:03:09,360
words,
in the absence of external torics,

929
01:03:09,690 --> 01:03:13,680
angular momentum of a system is concerned,
that means it has the same value.

930
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:20,490
Angular momentum is conserved

931
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:26,640
if power week's journal is zero.

932
01:03:30,510 --> 01:03:33,660
That's like saying linear momentum is
conservative. The external forces zero.

933
01:03:34,770 --> 01:03:36,990
So let's take some examples of this.

934
01:03:37,140 --> 01:03:42,140
Here's one example that is a disk on a
spindle spinning around the discuss some

935
01:03:44,610 --> 01:03:48,690
more money to finish your
eye. One spinning at some
angular velocity. Omega one

936
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:54,210
on top of this is the second disk,

937
01:03:55,030 --> 01:03:57,360
I guess the one millimeter away.
Andrew said rest.

938
01:03:58,800 --> 01:03:59,080
Yeah,

939
01:03:59,080 --> 01:04:00,880
it's got some woman to
finish your eye too,

940
01:04:01,150 --> 01:04:02,890
but it's got the same center as this guy.

941
01:04:04,780 --> 01:04:07,930
And then this one follows on that
one and the question is what happens?

942
01:04:10,430 --> 01:04:11,930
So I think we all know what happens.

943
01:04:11,990 --> 01:04:16,610
We all know the true will now stick to
get them rotated as a single unit with a

944
01:04:16,611 --> 01:04:18,260
common angular velocity.

945
01:04:19,850 --> 01:04:22,640
So the law of conservation
of angular momentum will say,

946
01:04:23,330 --> 01:04:28,330
I want Omega one for the first guy plus
zero for the second guy is now equal to

947
01:04:29,350 --> 01:04:32,750
I want plus I two times my final omega.

948
01:04:34,460 --> 01:04:36,890
So it's a trivial thing
to solve for Omega.

949
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:42,980
This should remind you of the following
problem in translation motion.

950
01:04:43,940 --> 01:04:48,940
That is a body sitting at rest and one
on m two there's a body and one coming at

951
01:04:50,541 --> 01:04:55,250
a speed v one the stick together and
travel as a unit. What happens then?

952
01:04:55,251 --> 01:05:00,251
We say the initial momentum is the
momentum of m one plus m two traveling or

953
01:05:00,321 --> 01:05:05,321
some final speed is identical to that
with the usual dictionary for translating

954
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:10,530
quantities here.
Okay,

955
01:05:11,580 --> 01:05:16,290
now let's take a slightly more
interesting problem that made it go down.

956
01:05:17,030 --> 01:05:19,570
You're spinning.
I'm seeing it from the top.

957
01:05:21,010 --> 01:05:24,730
It's got some angular velocity. I
won. I mean I ain't got a momentum.

958
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:28,630
I want Omega one because of moment
definition, angular velocity.

959
01:05:29,220 --> 01:05:33,760
This is the top view and I dropped
a piece of chewing gum on it.

960
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:36,460
What happened?
It's very simple.

961
01:05:37,150 --> 01:05:39,700
The chewing gum and the thing
will start rotating together.

962
01:05:40,420 --> 01:05:44,080
The new moment of finish or you should
use here would be this Mr squared.

963
01:05:44,081 --> 01:05:46,810
I think people seem to know that when
you stick a point mass on a disk,

964
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:49,630
extra contribution, Mr
Square, you'll slow down.

965
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:56,880
Remember, these are problems in which
there are no external tarkes one disc.

966
01:05:56,910 --> 01:05:59,910
This disc is speeding up that
disk. A slowing, I'm sorry,

967
01:05:59,911 --> 01:06:02,130
this is speeding that up
and that is slowing this,

968
01:06:02,131 --> 01:06:04,890
but together they can actually end
the tour after the whole point.

969
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:06,830
Yeah.

970
01:06:06,830 --> 01:06:11,830
What if this party or chewing gum was
not just dropped but shot from the side

971
01:06:12,770 --> 01:06:17,770
like this with some Speed v zero it's
got some mass m this guy is eight Esr big

972
01:06:20,271 --> 01:06:21,860
game.
Not what happens.

973
01:06:24,510 --> 01:06:26,190
This is something that may not be obvious.

974
01:06:26,210 --> 01:06:30,360
You a party that's traveling and then
comes and lambs and sticks to it.

975
01:06:32,410 --> 01:06:33,530
What's the difference now?

976
01:06:34,420 --> 01:06:35,253
Yup.

977
01:06:35,390 --> 01:06:40,390
This is going to have to apply
for with the motion of the body.

978
01:06:41,070 --> 01:06:42,390
Very good.
So that's important.

979
01:06:42,850 --> 01:06:44,860
Excellent.
So let me repeat what he said.

980
01:06:45,370 --> 01:06:48,150
This moving chewing gum
has to be brought to rest.

981
01:06:48,860 --> 01:06:50,590
Be brought [inaudible] by the disc.

982
01:06:50,591 --> 01:06:53,080
Little push it backwards and the
chewing gum and push it forward.

983
01:06:53,081 --> 01:06:57,040
So it'll apply a torque that
Mississippi Chante angular momentum.

984
01:06:58,270 --> 01:07:00,760
But instead of going through
that route of finding the Torque,

985
01:07:01,180 --> 01:07:03,550
if I only knew the angular
momentum of this party,

986
01:07:04,210 --> 01:07:06,400
then I will add it to the
angular momentum of the disc.

987
01:07:07,030 --> 01:07:09,730
Then I would say that's the total
angular momentum. That should not change.

988
01:07:09,731 --> 01:07:10,600
So the question is,

989
01:07:10,900 --> 01:07:15,250
what's the angular momentum of a mass
that's not really moving in a circle,

990
01:07:15,251 --> 01:07:18,820
but that's moving in a straight line.
And the answer it is,

991
01:07:19,390 --> 01:07:23,020
pretend that is part of a circle
right there. Moving a disability,

992
01:07:23,620 --> 01:07:26,500
what will be its angular momentum?
In other words,

993
01:07:27,100 --> 01:07:29,890
if you had the moving party
and you'd look to your left,

994
01:07:29,891 --> 01:07:34,600
the disk is spinning and you're going
at a certain speed at that instant,

995
01:07:34,601 --> 01:07:37,600
you are not distinguishable from another
body that's actually orbiting the

996
01:07:37,601 --> 01:07:38,434
center.

997
01:07:39,610 --> 01:07:44,080
But what would be the relation of your
velocity of your angular velocity? Well,

998
01:07:44,081 --> 01:07:48,340
your tangents are velocity is v Zero
Angle of velocity will be be zero divided

999
01:07:48,341 --> 01:07:51,220
by R
had that incident.

1000
01:07:51,250 --> 01:07:54,010
That would be your angular velocity
because somebody we're looking at you,

1001
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:56,110
you will be there now.
You'll be there later.

1002
01:07:56,320 --> 01:07:59,870
Your data will change and the
angular velocity will be be zero.

1003
01:07:59,940 --> 01:08:04,940
Our net 40 your angular momentum
will be m r square times Omega,

1004
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:14,200
but you can aid us m R
squared Times v Zero over our,

1005
01:08:14,590 --> 01:08:17,130
it becomes an B zero r

1006
01:08:19,220 --> 01:08:23,330
which I would like to write as p
times r but p is the usual moment.

1007
01:08:24,580 --> 01:08:27,350
So when a body comes with
a tangential momentum,

1008
01:08:27,351 --> 01:08:32,210
P and plants have cell phone, the disk,
it actually has an angular momentum.

1009
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:36,200
P Times r.
This is not very surprising.

1010
01:08:36,410 --> 01:08:40,520
Just like art himself gives the force
our time speed gives the angular moment.

1011
01:08:41,330 --> 01:08:45,950
So the surprising thing for you guys's
things don't have to be going around the

1012
01:08:45,951 --> 01:08:47,720
circle to have an angular momentum.

1013
01:08:47,930 --> 01:08:50,510
They can be going in a
straight line at every instant.

1014
01:08:50,630 --> 01:08:54,170
I can find the angular momentum by
asking what is the moment of inertia,

1015
01:08:54,230 --> 01:08:56,840
namely Mr Square and what's
the angular velocity?

1016
01:08:58,460 --> 01:09:02,240
The angular velocity is easiest to find
when this guy is right next to the disk.

1017
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:05,730
The new, you know from what we
did earlier, angular velocities,

1018
01:09:05,780 --> 01:09:09,650
linear velocity divided by R.
Okay.

1019
01:09:09,651 --> 01:09:13,220
The last problem I want to do,
which I'm not going to do quantitatively,

1020
01:09:13,670 --> 01:09:15,800
but qualitatively is a very,
very interesting problem.

1021
01:09:17,210 --> 01:09:22,210
Go to a single particle in translational
motion with momentum is empty and we

1022
01:09:23,811 --> 01:09:26,660
know if there are no forces,
the momentum cannot change.

1023
01:09:28,130 --> 01:09:29,330
So NBA is a constant.

1024
01:09:31,580 --> 01:09:36,580
Now that translates into visa
constant because is a constant,

1025
01:09:36,591 --> 01:09:41,510
there's nothing you can do and now comes
the interesting possibilities that are

1026
01:09:41,511 --> 01:09:44,000
available to you when you do rotations.

1027
01:09:44,990 --> 01:09:48,110
And that's the famous ice capade example.
Okay.

1028
01:09:48,590 --> 01:09:53,410
So let me do the ice capades thing.
So here his eyes here, the some,

1029
01:09:54,290 --> 01:09:56,730
uh,
the answer or,

1030
01:09:57,610 --> 01:09:58,443
okay.

1031
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:04,750
All right. So this person is
spinning around with some,

1032
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:09,610
I lost you omega with that hands out,
you emphasize the whole thing.

1033
01:10:09,820 --> 01:10:11,410
Let's imagine this ice dancer,

1034
01:10:11,420 --> 01:10:16,420
there's no mass except for
the two dumbbells on two
hands are the two masses and

1035
01:10:17,020 --> 01:10:20,770
a person is rotating with
some angular velocity. Omega.

1036
01:10:21,310 --> 01:10:24,790
That means a moment.
Angular momentum is I times Omega

1037
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:27,910
and that cannot change.

1038
01:10:28,660 --> 01:10:33,460
But then suppose the ice dams are
designed to do the following, which is to

1039
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:39,160
drop the arms right to the
side so that for all purposes,

1040
01:10:39,161 --> 01:10:42,220
the masters that are the center, now you
really reduce the moment of finisher.

1041
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:47,350
So what'll happen, uh,
so I will signify that.

1042
01:10:47,750 --> 01:10:50,830
And globalize is bigger or
Harris kind of standing out.

1043
01:10:51,770 --> 01:10:54,820
So that's a rapidly spinning ballerina.

1044
01:10:55,450 --> 01:11:00,450
And that's because what is changing is I,

1045
01:11:02,350 --> 01:11:04,600
if bodies curtained their mass,
it'll be very interesting.

1046
01:11:04,990 --> 01:11:07,600
If a body can reduce the mass in half,
it get double the velocity.

1047
01:11:08,290 --> 01:11:10,270
But bodies have no way of
getting rid of their maths.

1048
01:11:10,300 --> 01:11:11,920
But bodies can change that anger.

1049
01:11:12,220 --> 01:11:16,830
I'm the moment of here just
by redistributing the mass
and that's why all these,

1050
01:11:16,831 --> 01:11:19,140
uh, ice dancers, you know, they,

1051
01:11:19,620 --> 01:11:23,100
they spin around and they bring their
hands together at the speed up and slow

1052
01:11:23,101 --> 01:11:27,660
down to speed up and slow down.
What is interesting is the following,

1053
01:11:27,690 --> 01:11:30,330
if you go back and find
the candidate energy,

1054
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:32,730
you would find a kinetic
energy's not the same

1055
01:11:35,010 --> 01:11:38,960
because Canada energy is one half
Iomega squared. The beginning of it,

1056
01:11:38,961 --> 01:11:43,720
it is one half one omega, one square at
the end of the day is one half I too,

1057
01:11:44,460 --> 01:11:47,360
or may got to square, but
Omega to Canberra, tennis,

1058
01:11:47,820 --> 01:11:52,320
I won all but I to Omega one square.

1059
01:11:52,810 --> 01:11:53,643
Yeah.

1060
01:11:54,490 --> 01:11:58,220
And you can easily compare the two
numbers in the geometry I've given you to

1061
01:11:58,221 --> 01:12:00,070
show the final candidate
candidate is actually higher.

1062
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:05,430
When you start spinning faster,
you in fact have a

1063
01:12:07,110 --> 01:12:08,190
bigger kinetic energy

1064
01:12:10,750 --> 01:12:14,910
because if you don't make a doubles,
because you want me to finish,

1065
01:12:14,911 --> 01:12:17,640
it went down by a factor of
half that keeps iomega constant.

1066
01:12:17,670 --> 01:12:21,990
What do you suppose to square the Omega?
So we ended up product Iomega Square.

1067
01:12:22,410 --> 01:12:25,350
When you reduce one by half and double
the other, you gain a factor of two.

1068
01:12:26,310 --> 01:12:30,450
So take the simple case where, uh, I to
is half of I won and you will see it.

1069
01:12:33,580 --> 01:12:37,420
Okay. So you can ask,

1070
01:12:37,421 --> 01:12:41,380
where does that energy come from?
How does this uh,

1071
01:12:41,830 --> 01:12:46,690
ice skater pickup speed pick up
angular momentum or Kennedy Energy?

1072
01:12:46,900 --> 01:12:49,270
Anglo momentum doesn't change
but rotational energy changes.

1073
01:12:51,470 --> 01:12:55,890
Yep. Sort of court type
show like angular energy.

1074
01:12:57,320 --> 01:12:58,153
Uh,

1075
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:03,560
you can do this without invoking any
new concepts using this old concept.

1076
01:13:04,260 --> 01:13:05,430
You just go back and say,
look,

1077
01:13:05,431 --> 01:13:09,300
I had only one rule in this game with
the energy went up. Ben. What? Yes.

1078
01:13:10,730 --> 01:13:15,630
The system itself is performing work on
a different elements of the system. Uh,

1079
01:13:15,770 --> 01:13:17,570
so that work is increasing.

1080
01:13:18,490 --> 01:13:21,220
Yeah. But how about who is
doing work? The skater is

1081
01:13:21,350 --> 01:13:25,680
doing, uh, work by bringing
together the barbells.

1082
01:13:26,070 --> 01:13:28,020
Yeah.
And why is that take any work?

1083
01:13:28,770 --> 01:13:31,980
Because I gravity is pulling you down
yet moving perpendicular. The gravity.

1084
01:13:31,981 --> 01:13:35,940
So why are you,
you had an answer in the last row.

1085
01:13:36,610 --> 01:13:37,443
Yes.

1086
01:13:41,190 --> 01:13:41,611
No,
but see,

1087
01:13:41,611 --> 01:13:44,310
you're not doing work against gravity
because you're not changing the height of

1088
01:13:44,311 --> 01:13:47,010
those barbells. You're
just pulling it in. Yes.

1089
01:13:47,250 --> 01:13:49,940
In your, you have a different
than the potential energy.

1090
01:13:50,100 --> 01:13:52,550
You have less the energy
and you're holding it up.

1091
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:55,810
Yeah. No, but oh, oh, I see. I'm sorry.

1092
01:13:56,650 --> 01:13:59,020
I know why you guys had giving
this answer. It's not your fault.

1093
01:13:59,470 --> 01:14:02,890
Take the case where you don't
change the height of the dumbbells.

1094
01:14:03,190 --> 01:14:07,990
Go from there to here. Not Changing the
heights of the MGH does not the answer.

1095
01:14:08,260 --> 01:14:09,093
Yes.

1096
01:14:10,530 --> 01:14:15,530
[inaudible]

1097
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:22,470
against this [inaudible]

1098
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:27,530
yes, energy. It comes from the muscle.

1099
01:14:27,560 --> 01:14:29,990
But the question is why do
you have to do any work?

1100
01:14:30,610 --> 01:14:34,310
And I think since I'm running out of time,
I will repeat that answer,

1101
01:14:34,311 --> 01:14:37,070
which I believe is close enough
to what I was looking for.

1102
01:14:37,580 --> 01:14:39,050
When the dumbbells or spinning,

1103
01:14:39,530 --> 01:14:42,740
they're going in a circle and we
know that they have an acceleration.

1104
01:14:42,741 --> 01:14:46,190
We squared over R and we know somebody's
got to provide NV squared over r and

1105
01:14:46,191 --> 01:14:47,780
the person that's providing that force.

1106
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:50,690
But as long as it's providing
the force but not moving,

1107
01:14:51,380 --> 01:14:54,960
you can move tangentially. But in the
force and velocity of perpendicular,

1108
01:14:54,961 --> 01:14:58,040
so you're not doing any work,
but the minute you pull in,

1109
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,430
you're applying a force
and the displacement,

1110
01:15:01,431 --> 01:15:05,090
which at both parallel than
f Times d is no longer zero.

1111
01:15:05,180 --> 01:15:07,730
You will find that for these
things that tend to fly off,

1112
01:15:07,731 --> 01:15:09,750
I see set and you're trying
to not only hold onto them,

1113
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:13,400
but trying to bring them in during the
time. It'll be just like lifting weights.

1114
01:15:14,180 --> 01:15:16,760
If you want to lift weights and you go
to a planet where there's no gravity,

1115
01:15:16,761 --> 01:15:19,940
you can tell somebody to spend you.
Then when you pull this stuff in,

1116
01:15:19,970 --> 01:15:22,290
it'd be like lifting weights.
Okay?

1117
01:15:22,291 --> 01:15:25,090
That's what the person's doing and
that's where the energy is coming.
