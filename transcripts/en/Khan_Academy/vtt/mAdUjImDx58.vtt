00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.338
- [Voiceover] What we're
gonna talk about in this video

00:00:01.338 --> 00:00:04.976
is what I consider one of
the most fascinating subjects

00:00:04.976 --> 00:00:07.306
in biology and that's the variation we see

00:00:07.306 --> 00:00:10.352
from species to species in life histories

00:00:10.352 --> 00:00:12.983
and lifespans and the
rate of reproduction.

00:00:12.983 --> 00:00:16.066
For example, we have three
different species here.

00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:18.568
On the left we have an African elephant,

00:00:18.568 --> 00:00:19.993
and African elephant you might know,

00:00:19.993 --> 00:00:22.939
can live a long time,
especially out in the wild.

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:26.526
It can live many decades,
even 40, 50, 60 years.

00:00:26.526 --> 00:00:29.612
And their life history
actually parallels human,

00:00:29.612 --> 00:00:32.255
at least modern human, life
history in a lot of ways.

00:00:32.255 --> 00:00:34.303
The first 10 years of their life,

00:00:34.303 --> 00:00:36.856
they are very dependent on their parents.

00:00:36.856 --> 00:00:39.905
After that, they kind of enter into a bit

00:00:39.905 --> 00:00:43.505
of an adolescence very
similar to how humans do

00:00:43.505 --> 00:00:44.338
where in theory, they could reproduce

00:00:44.338 --> 00:00:45.171
but they don't tend to

00:00:45.171 --> 00:00:46.004
and they are still somewhat dependent.

00:00:49.311 --> 00:00:51.876
And then they move into a phase

00:00:51.876 --> 00:00:53.473
when they do reproduce.

00:00:53.473 --> 00:00:54.306
And they will reproduce on the order of

00:00:54.306 --> 00:00:55.139
once every two to four years.

00:01:01.873 --> 00:01:04.769
A female African elephant will reproduce.

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.084
Their gestation periods,
the amount of time the baby

00:01:08.084 --> 00:01:11.688
elephant will be in the mother's
womb is on the order of,

00:01:11.688 --> 00:01:13.744
it's actually longer than, for humans.

00:01:13.744 --> 00:01:15.747
Humans you probably know is nine months,

00:01:15.747 --> 00:01:17.232
for an African elephant it is 22 months.

00:01:17.232 --> 00:01:19.054
And so because of that,

00:01:19.054 --> 00:01:22.305
they can reproduce about
once every 2 to 4 years.

00:01:22.305 --> 00:01:24.340
Now, another example, and these are --

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.558
actually elephants and
rabbits might not look

00:01:27.558 --> 00:01:29.584
closely related to you,
but they are actually

00:01:29.584 --> 00:01:32.173
pretty closely related if you think about

00:01:32.173 --> 00:01:33.467
the entire tree of life.

00:01:33.467 --> 00:01:36.236
They are both mammals
and actually everything

00:01:36.236 --> 00:01:38.419
we're considering here are animals.

00:01:38.419 --> 00:01:40.509
We're going to consider
African elephants, rabbits

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:42.400
and we're going to consider salmon.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.100
But what I'm talking about
about applies to all life.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.718
It applies to bacteria,
it applies to trees,

00:01:47.718 --> 00:01:51.457
there's a huge variation
in their fecundity,

00:01:51.457 --> 00:01:53.719
the rate at which they reproduce.

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:55.653
Let me write that word down.

00:01:55.653 --> 00:01:56.486
Fecundity.

00:01:57.754 --> 00:02:01.340
Fecundity, the rate at
which they reproduce,

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.738
and also variation in
their actual lifespan,

00:02:03.738 --> 00:02:05.404
whether we're talking about a tree

00:02:05.404 --> 00:02:08.844
or a bacteria, or a fish, or a mammal.

00:02:08.844 --> 00:02:10.826
Just going from one mammal to another

00:02:10.826 --> 00:02:13.704
let's go to a rabbit, and
depending on which type

00:02:13.704 --> 00:02:17.214
of rabbit you're talking
about, but a rabbit could,

00:02:17.214 --> 00:02:20.874
lifespan is in the single-digit years.

00:02:20.874 --> 00:02:22.872
But unlike an elephant, an elephant,

00:02:22.872 --> 00:02:26.346
the first 10, 15, 20
years of their life, they

00:02:26.346 --> 00:02:28.785
aren't in that reproductive
phase of their life.

00:02:28.785 --> 00:02:31.792
A rabbit enters into
that reproductive phase

00:02:31.792 --> 00:02:33.740
of their life within several months,

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.448
within four, five months of birth.

00:02:36.448 --> 00:02:39.246
And so, once they enter
into that reproductive phase

00:02:39.246 --> 00:02:42.206
and I'm showing the reproductive
phase in magenta here,

00:02:42.206 --> 00:02:44.558
they can reproduce a lot.

00:02:44.558 --> 00:02:46.784
They have high fecundity,
they have very high

00:02:46.784 --> 00:02:48.939
reproductive rate.

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:51.405
Every time a female rabbit has a litter,

00:02:51.405 --> 00:02:54.905
it can have many, many baby rabbits in it.

00:02:58.827 --> 00:03:02.994
The numbers I found were one
to 14, one to 14 rabbits.

00:03:04.423 --> 00:03:07.128
And not only can they
have one to 14 rabbits

00:03:07.128 --> 00:03:10.243
every time they have a
litter, but they can have

00:03:10.243 --> 00:03:14.442
they can do this, on the
order of once a month.

00:03:14.442 --> 00:03:16.275
So every, every month.

00:03:18.904 --> 00:03:21.143
So even though the lifespan
of the female rabbit

00:03:21.143 --> 00:03:23.639
depending on which type of
rabbit you're talking about,

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:27.056
it might be three, four, five, six years,

00:03:28.643 --> 00:03:31.176
depending on the type of
rabbit you're talking about.

00:03:31.176 --> 00:03:33.340
You can imagine, if they're
producing let's say,

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.243
10 rabbits every month per
year, they could produce

00:03:37.243 --> 00:03:41.535
120 rabbits, or, if they can
produce 10 rabbits per month

00:03:41.535 --> 00:03:43.752
12 months a year, that's
120 rabbits a year

00:03:43.752 --> 00:03:45.335
over several years.

00:03:47.748 --> 00:03:50.031
And then you can imagine those rabbits,

00:03:50.031 --> 00:03:53.001
very quickly, the female
ones, if you assume roughly

00:03:53.001 --> 00:03:55.123
half of them are female, that half

00:03:55.123 --> 00:03:57.034
can very quickly get into
that reproductive phase

00:03:57.034 --> 00:03:58.903
and start reproducing at a similar rate.

00:03:58.903 --> 00:04:00.763
So, on an individual level

00:04:00.763 --> 00:04:02.800
a female rabbit has high fecundity,

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.503
and on a population level,
that group of rabbits

00:04:06.503 --> 00:04:10.029
will also have very, very high fecundity.

00:04:10.029 --> 00:04:11.773
And then we can look at another example.

00:04:11.773 --> 00:04:14.109
And this is the example of salmon

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:16.293
and there are many types of salmon

00:04:16.293 --> 00:04:18.624
but the general way that salmon,

00:04:18.624 --> 00:04:22.782
the general life cycle
that salmon go through

00:04:22.782 --> 00:04:26.668
is they are born then
and they are usually born

00:04:26.668 --> 00:04:29.684
up some stream and usually some water

00:04:29.684 --> 00:04:32.605
where there isn't a strong current,

00:04:32.605 --> 00:04:35.417
and then once the baby salmon are born,

00:04:35.417 --> 00:04:38.346
and they can be born in groups of hundreds

00:04:38.346 --> 00:04:41.460
or thousands, they make
their way down that river

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.137
down that stream, into the
ocean and then they have

00:04:44.137 --> 00:04:46.618
many years of a growth phase in the ocean

00:04:46.618 --> 00:04:48.478
where they get larger and larger.

00:04:48.478 --> 00:04:50.339
They're not reproducing then

00:04:50.339 --> 00:04:52.812
and then when they are ready to reproduce

00:04:52.812 --> 00:04:56.628
they fight their way
back up the same stream

00:04:56.628 --> 00:04:58.657
that they were born in or the same river

00:04:58.657 --> 00:05:01.070
that they were born in,
they fight their way

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:04.414
back up to it they reproduce, and this is

00:05:04.414 --> 00:05:06.241
both the males and females.

00:05:06.241 --> 00:05:08.985
The males fertilize the
females produce the eggs,

00:05:08.985 --> 00:05:12.857
the males fertilize the
eggs and then they die.

00:05:12.857 --> 00:05:15.845
So they have one reproductive event.

00:05:15.845 --> 00:05:17.921
So you have one reproductive then death

00:05:17.921 --> 00:05:21.195
and then they kill, they just die.

00:05:21.195 --> 00:05:22.685
People still understanding,

00:05:22.685 --> 00:05:24.834
why exactly does this happen?

00:05:24.834 --> 00:05:28.584
So one reproductive
event, reproductive event

00:05:32.662 --> 00:05:34.162
and then they die.

00:05:35.312 --> 00:05:37.853
And there's actually a
technical term for species

00:05:37.853 --> 00:05:39.074
that do this.

00:05:39.074 --> 00:05:41.719
Salmon isn't the only one
where they have that one,

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:43.739
where they go out with
you can kind of view it as

00:05:43.739 --> 00:05:46.264
a big bang, where they have
that one reproductive event

00:05:46.264 --> 00:05:49.367
where they might have hundreds
or even thousands of eggs,

00:05:49.367 --> 00:05:50.768
but then they die.

00:05:50.768 --> 00:05:52.843
This is called semel parity.

00:05:52.843 --> 00:05:54.881
Let me write this down.

00:05:54.881 --> 00:05:57.464
So this is called semel parity.

00:05:59.956 --> 00:06:02.712
Semel comes from the Latin for once.

00:06:02.712 --> 00:06:06.186
Parity comes from the
Latin for to beget so,

00:06:06.186 --> 00:06:07.914
to beget once.

00:06:07.914 --> 00:06:10.195
You're reproducing once,
and then in the case of

00:06:10.195 --> 00:06:12.240
salmon, you are are dying.

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.109
And you might say okay,
if that's semel parity

00:06:14.109 --> 00:06:16.355
what would we call an elephant or rabbits,

00:06:16.355 --> 00:06:18.484
for sure, and an elephant as well.

00:06:18.484 --> 00:06:20.377
They can have multiple
reproductive events.

00:06:20.377 --> 00:06:23.210
Well, that is called itero parity.

00:06:25.079 --> 00:06:26.829
Itero, itero parity.

00:06:27.984 --> 00:06:30.465
You might've heard the word iterate

00:06:30.465 --> 00:06:33.076
that means to repeat something

00:06:33.076 --> 00:06:34.952
or to do something over and over again.

00:06:34.952 --> 00:06:37.429
Itero is the root for, it means repeat.

00:06:37.429 --> 00:06:40.468
So, itero parity, beget repeatedly.

00:06:40.468 --> 00:06:43.253
And so that's what animals
like elephants and,

00:06:43.253 --> 00:06:47.134
for sure, rabbits are actually doing.

00:06:47.134 --> 00:06:49.028
And what's fascinating about all of this

00:06:49.028 --> 00:06:51.410
and it is a question that I have wondered

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:54.457
many, since I first
realized when I was young

00:06:54.457 --> 00:06:57.445
was, wow, why is there
so much variation here?

00:06:57.445 --> 00:07:01.028
Is, why has nature
selected for or why have

00:07:02.075 --> 00:07:05.279
these species found niches
in which they can operate

00:07:05.279 --> 00:07:07.883
in which it makes sense,
where natural selection

00:07:07.883 --> 00:07:11.569
has selected for these
very different lifespans,

00:07:11.569 --> 00:07:14.524
these very different reproduction rates

00:07:14.524 --> 00:07:16.661
this variation in fecundity,

00:07:16.661 --> 00:07:19.320
this, you know sometimes itero parity,

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:20.825
sometimes a semel parity.

00:07:20.825 --> 00:07:23.135
And it is a bit of, it's not a mystery,

00:07:23.135 --> 00:07:25.172
people are studying this and they have

00:07:25.172 --> 00:07:27.517
good hypothesis, but
we don't know for sure,

00:07:27.517 --> 00:07:30.193
especially from species to species.

00:07:30.193 --> 00:07:31.994
And a framework you could use

00:07:31.994 --> 00:07:33.411
to think about it

00:07:35.851 --> 00:07:37.663
is a species,

00:07:37.663 --> 00:07:40.580
they're trying to optimize survival

00:07:41.732 --> 00:07:43.527
and not even of the individual,

00:07:43.527 --> 00:07:45.898
they're trying to optimize survival of

00:07:45.898 --> 00:07:48.190
really their genetic information.

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:50.273
It's not like the species or the genes are

00:07:50.273 --> 00:07:52.127
actively trying to do
it, but natural selection

00:07:52.127 --> 00:07:53.907
is doing that for them.

00:07:53.907 --> 00:07:57.382
So let's call this box natural selection.

00:07:57.382 --> 00:07:58.882
Natural selection,

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:01.868
and so, and what you have

00:08:01.868 --> 00:08:04.601
coming out of this is the fittest,

00:08:04.601 --> 00:08:05.768
fittest genes.

00:08:06.802 --> 00:08:08.544
And when we talk about fittest

00:08:08.544 --> 00:08:09.982
genes, were not talking about

00:08:09.982 --> 00:08:11.449
somehow that some are better

00:08:11.449 --> 00:08:13.717
than others, we're just
saying for that environment,

00:08:13.717 --> 00:08:18.301
the ones that seem, the
genes that produce the traits

00:08:18.301 --> 00:08:21.640
that are most suitable to survival

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:23.812
and most suitable towards reproduction

00:08:23.812 --> 00:08:25.415
and then the inputs that are

00:08:25.415 --> 00:08:27.426
going into this natural selection box

00:08:27.426 --> 00:08:31.040
are things like availability of energy,

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:33.532
of food, of what I called free energy.

00:08:33.532 --> 00:08:36.263
Availability, because it's
not just obviously plants

00:08:36.263 --> 00:08:39.313
can get that free energy from the sun.

00:08:39.313 --> 00:08:42.396
Availability, availability of energy,

00:08:45.094 --> 00:08:47.123
we can talk about the

00:08:47.123 --> 00:08:48.956
predatory environment,

00:08:50.073 --> 00:08:52.823
predatory, predatory environment.

00:08:54.641 --> 00:08:57.558
We can talk about disease, disease.

00:08:59.048 --> 00:09:02.815
Every moment that an organism is alive

00:09:02.815 --> 00:09:05.320
it has to worry about these things.

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:07.543
It has to worry about finding food

00:09:07.543 --> 00:09:08.995
or competing for food.

00:09:08.995 --> 00:09:10.768
It has to worry about predators,

00:09:10.768 --> 00:09:12.537
it has to worry about disease.

00:09:12.537 --> 00:09:14.250
And once again the individual organism

00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:15.083
is not sitting there, it's not necessary

00:09:15.083 --> 00:09:16.963
that these salmon are like,

00:09:16.963 --> 00:09:18.674
"Oh, I hope I don't catch a disease,"

00:09:18.674 --> 00:09:22.198
or they might not even be
stressed about the bears

00:09:22.198 --> 00:09:24.807
that might try to grab
them as they go upstream

00:09:24.807 --> 00:09:27.629
but these are the factors
that play into how

00:09:27.629 --> 00:09:30.379
or what gets selected for I guess

00:09:33.054 --> 00:09:35.998
is that the best way to phrase it.

00:09:35.998 --> 00:09:38.799
And in terms from a species point of view

00:09:38.799 --> 00:09:41.301
the various styles will
these are things like

00:09:41.301 --> 00:09:46.121
reproduction, like what is
the species decide to do

00:09:46.121 --> 00:09:48.365
given these constraints?

00:09:48.365 --> 00:09:52.132
And so the various styles are fecundity,

00:09:52.132 --> 00:09:53.684
actually, let me write this,

00:09:53.684 --> 00:09:55.843
rate of reproduction, age of reproduction

00:09:55.843 --> 00:09:59.343
and these are related, age of reproduction

00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:03.414
things like lifespan and
these are all related

00:10:03.414 --> 00:10:04.858
in some way.

00:10:04.858 --> 00:10:07.608
Lifespan, growth, growth, health.

00:10:10.491 --> 00:10:13.158
And a species and an organism is

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:16.798
making trade-offs all the time.

00:10:16.798 --> 00:10:19.657
You know, the salmon goes
through that huge phase

00:10:19.657 --> 00:10:22.127
where it's deciding to
apply most of its energy

00:10:22.127 --> 00:10:24.650
towards growth and survival,
and then all of a sudden

00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:28.186
it kicks into another
gear, where it actually

00:10:28.186 --> 00:10:30.465
uses a lot of energy that was stored up

00:10:30.465 --> 00:10:33.488
to go upstream and goes
into a reproductive phase

00:10:33.488 --> 00:10:35.579
and then and then it dies.

00:10:35.579 --> 00:10:39.149
And natural selection
has, this has happened

00:10:39.149 --> 00:10:42.820
arguably because that somehow helps

00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:45.843
the salmon's DNA to spread more.

00:10:45.843 --> 00:10:48.702
Maybe somehow it adds
nutrients to the water

00:10:48.702 --> 00:10:51.232
or you know, they put all
that energy to go upstream

00:10:51.232 --> 00:10:53.956
so that their offspring
will have an easier time

00:10:53.956 --> 00:10:55.778
going downstream.

00:10:55.778 --> 00:10:57.772
But there's also other trade-offs.

00:10:57.772 --> 00:10:59.501
You could have things that lay,

00:10:59.501 --> 00:11:01.813
a salmon might, a female salmon might

00:11:01.813 --> 00:11:04.117
lay thousands of eggs
but very few of those

00:11:04.117 --> 00:11:08.016
actually make it, make it
through the full cycle.

00:11:08.016 --> 00:11:09.456
The estimates that I've seen is that

00:11:09.456 --> 00:11:11.852
out of those thousands
of eggs that get laid

00:11:11.852 --> 00:11:14.973
only about three make it back.

00:11:14.973 --> 00:11:17.642
This was the example I
saw for sockeye salmon,

00:11:17.642 --> 00:11:19.676
on average only three of them make it back

00:11:19.676 --> 00:11:21.274
for the next year.

00:11:21.274 --> 00:11:23.878
So you have a huge amount
of, I guess you could say,

00:11:23.878 --> 00:11:26.950
attrition, while in the
case of an elephant,

00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:29.869
they invest more per offspring

00:11:29.869 --> 00:11:32.289
and you have a much higher probability

00:11:32.289 --> 00:11:34.676
that each of those offspring will survive.

00:11:34.676 --> 00:11:37.062
So there's all sorts of
interesting trade-offs

00:11:37.062 --> 00:11:39.566
to think about when you
think about life history,

00:11:39.566 --> 00:11:43.267
lifecycle, lifespan and
things like fecundity

00:11:43.267 --> 00:11:45.600
and how organisms reproduce.
