00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:02.294
- [Lecturer] What we're going
to discuss in this video

00:00:02.294 --> 00:00:05.370
is Executive Orders.

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.850
And these are directives being issued

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:10.170
by the President of the United States

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.620
that can have the force of law.

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:14.200
And I know what you're thinking,

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.590
isn't Congress our legislative body,

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.260
the body that actually creates the laws?

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.110
And is it the job of the President to be

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.340
the head of the Executive
Branch to execute on those laws?

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.680
And if you are thinking
that, you are correct.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.410
But going all the way
back to George Washington,

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.220
Presidents have issued Executive Orders.

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.130
Some are fairly lightweight.

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:38.970
They might be a directive
for something to be done

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.860
in a certain way, or a small regulation,

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.540
or even appointing someone to a job.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.590
But sometimes these Executive Orders

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.350
can be quite significant.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.060
And the constitutional
justification for these Orders

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:56.370
come mainly from two different
statements in Article II

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.560
of the U.S. Constitution.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.747
In Section One, it starts off saying,

00:01:00.747 --> 00:01:03.747
"The Executive Power shall
be vested in a President

00:01:03.747 --> 00:01:05.970
"of the United States of America."

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.727
And at the end of Section
Three, it says that,

00:01:07.727 --> 00:01:11.017
"the President shall
take care that the laws

00:01:11.017 --> 00:01:13.370
"be faithfully executed."

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.550
And so, the clearest justification
for an Executive Order

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.550
are times when a regulation
is needed or a directive

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.990
is needed in order to
faithfully execute the laws.

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.000
But as we will see,
Presidents throughout history

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.760
have really pushed the boundary
here and have definitely

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.470
gone into territory that you might expect

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.450
to be the area of Congress.

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.010
Now in terms of appreciating how frequent

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:39.930
these Executive Orders are,

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.400
here is a chart that gives
the average Executive Orders

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.860
per year for the last few Presidents.

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.260
And you can see at the low end,

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.870
you have President Obama
and President George W. Bush

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:55.870
averaging about 35 or 36
Executive Orders per year.

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:57.510
And then all the way at the high end,

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.110
you get to Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter.

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.160
Now if you were to go even
further back in history,

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.190
Presidents like Franklin
Roosevelt had far more

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.670
Executive Orders than even this.

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.390
And just to appreciate some
of the most significant

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.113
Executive Orders ever made,

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.720
Lincoln's Emancipation
Proclamation in 1863

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.420
which was delivered during the Civil War,

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.420
it freed nearly three million slaves

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.510
in the Confederate states.

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.560
In 1942 a few months
after Japan's bombardment

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.250
of Pearl Harbor, Franklin Roosevelt issues

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.920
Executive Order 9066 which
called for the internment

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.950
of Americans of Japanese ancestry.

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.000
Historians have really frowned
on this Executive Order

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.050
because it was a blatant
disregard for the rights

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:46.410
of these Americans.

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.030
But at the time, Franklin
Roosevelt justified it

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.080
as a national security issue.

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.710
And then in 1952 during the Korean war,

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:57.480
steel workers are
threatening to go on strike.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.110
And so, President Truman
issues Executive Order 10340

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.560
that puts steel mills under the control

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.590
of the Commerce Secretary.

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.870
And the justification
here was that they were

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.930
in the middle of the war and that steel

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.370
is an essential material
for conducting the war.

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.480
Now what's really interesting
about this Executive Order,

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.720
is that the owners of the
steel mills did not like this

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.320
and they take the
government to Federal court.

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.360
It eventually gets to
the U.S. Supreme Court.

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.950
It's knows as the case,
Youngstown Sheet and Tube Company

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.980
versus Sawyer where Sawyer
was the Commerce Secretary.

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.270
And the Supreme Court rules
against President Truman

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:43.030
saying that this Executive
Order went beyond the bounds

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.160
of even the President's implied powers.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.650
So the big picture here
is that Executive Orders

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.890
are a method by which Presidents
over time have been able

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:55.930
to expand their power beyond
what is explicitly listed

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.740
in Article II of the Constitution.

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:02.260
Now like in all things, there
is a check on that power.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.240
And much of that comes from
the Supreme Court's ability

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.530
to rule Executive Orders unconstitutional.

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.890
But there still aren't clear
boundaries on what makes

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.440
an Executive Order constitutional or not.

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.400
And they are likely to continue
to be an area of debate

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.943
when it comes to powers of the President.
