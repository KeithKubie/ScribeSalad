Now the first thing to notice about open is

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.670
that we did not import anything in our code

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.690
to this function. In contrast, when we had to

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:12.840
use a function like rename. We said, import OS,

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.780
but not with this function. This is because functions

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.820
like open are so commonly used in Python that

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.620
they are always available. Don't take my word for

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:24.970
it. Let's look for it in the Python documentation.
