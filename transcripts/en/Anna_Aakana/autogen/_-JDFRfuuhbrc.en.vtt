00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.460
 One day, I went to an audition and the process went smoothly... 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.580
 Until the end, when I opened my stupid mouth, I said: 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:08.960
 "Well, thank you very much, should I go out there?" 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.960
 (Music stops, the atmosphere is stiff) 

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:15.120
 (the only door in this room) 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.060
 Well, yes. Unless you want to go out through the wall, hahaha! 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.740
 My stupid face is completely frozen. 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.470
 When I say the problem, I really want to swallow it back. 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.140
 But unfortunately, sometimes you are talking about some shit, and the others present are unfortunately heard. 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.680
 But fortunately, I am not the only one who will do this stupid thing, right? 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.390
 Just like once, I told others that my sister hangs up and they say: 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.720
 Oh no, is she okay? 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.340
 Oh... it’s not good at all. 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.380
 Now, that is definitely more than me asking: "Is I going to leave from that door?" 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:48.040
 Or is it really there? 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.770
 do you know? It's ok. I am just - I just want to set fire to self-immolation. 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:52.440
 I deserve it 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.580
 This is what I should do. I mean to say: This is a problem with brain damage, right? 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:59.120
 "Oh, I should go through this hole. Is that the only way to get out of here? Or should I be here with you forever?" 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.480
 "The only function of this door is to get in and out? That's great." 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.770
 "This burning flame gives me a feeling better than my inner shame." 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.740
 The worst part is that you remember the terrible moments a few years later. 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.540
 And think again 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:18.440
 "Thank you very much" 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.400
 "Well, should I go out there?" Oh, you idiot. 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.720
 Oh, not you, baby. you are perfect. You look super perfect, baby 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.760
 But this can't help but make me want to know. Just like everyone has said that brain damage, right? Like everyone. 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.500
 What did Michelle Obama say about the most brain-dead? 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:41.080
 "Can you say the number of 911 again? Oh, I am stupid, why are you asking this? I will search for it myself." 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.720
 Or the Queen of England? 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:47.809
 "No, Charles, this is the so-called butt tray. Otherwise, why do they call it the cigarette butt?" 

00:01:47.809 --> 00:01:48.700
 (giggle) 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.380
 "Stupid, dear, this mom knows best." 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:51.860
 Or Scarlett Johansson? 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:58.600
 "Hey, I am Scarlett Johansson, I am playing the grasshopper in the upcoming Ghost in the Shell." 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:04.319
 But what did you hear or the most stupid thing you said? 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.200
 And do you want to ignite your own impulses? Ok? 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:08.720
 I am Anna Akana. 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:09.760
 Keep it so great! 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.660
 Oh, but before you go, let you know that I will be at VidCon's 1408 booth. 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.760
 This is the timetable for my team. You should come here and see, I will sell Ghost and Stars with my parents here! Great 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:24.060
 And I also have some single shows. But the new show will be at AnnaAkana.com/shows 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:30.880
 Finally, when I wrote the Inuyasha fan fiction, I was 13 years old and my pen name was "Lightning". 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.360
 And I am back, but this time is an original novel at wattpad.com/annaakana 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.200
 So if you want to see it... 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.260
