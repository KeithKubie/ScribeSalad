First, we create our settings activity,

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:04.296
and this is the code that we got
from the gist.

00:00:04.296 --> 00:00:07.762
Then, in the Android Manifest, 
we declare the settings activity.

00:00:07.762 --> 00:00:12.200
We give it an activity named Settings, 
which is declared in the Strings file.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.880
We also declare the main activity
as the parent activity. That way,

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.520
when you hit the up button 
in the settings activity,

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.030
it will return back to the main activity.
