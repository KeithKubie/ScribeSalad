00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Okay. So we are going to build a Web site--

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
right now--called ASCII Chan.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
And this is going to be a message board

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
for sharing ASCII Art.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
It's going to have this general structure

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
where we will have a form with--

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
you know--it'll take a title and some ASCII Art--

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
a little submit button--

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and the user can submit this and below this form,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
they'll see ASCII Art that's been submitted by other people--things like that.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
So it'll be a one-page Web site.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
It'll have a form, and then the contents here.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
So for those of you who don't know what ASCII Art is,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
let me give you a few examples.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Here we are, on this Web site, Chris.com--

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
pretty awesome domain name.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
This Web site is dedicated to ASCII Art,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and as you can see here--

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
I'm just looking at a bunch of ASCII Art of cows.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
All ASCII Art is--it's just little pictures, drawn with keyboard characters.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:09.000
SO pretty cool; there's this huge--huge--encyclopedia of ASCII Art online

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and we are going to build a forum

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
for people to share their own ASCII Art.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Anyway, if you haven't seen it before, that's what it is.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
It's a fantastic way for people to

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
waste time in front of their keyboards.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Okay. Here we go.
