00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:23.700
PROFESSOR: OK, welcome back.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.680
We're going to be looking at
problem number 11 in the fall

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.270
2009 final exam.

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.880
This is one of those problems on
the exam that kind of tests

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.170
a whole bunch of other
stuff we couldn't get

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:34.600
into one big question.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.520
So it's looking at a bunch
of different areas.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.790
But the main themes are going
to be bonding and reaction

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.380
rates and half lives.

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.360
So the things I think you need
to know, the W I N list as I

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.740
usually call it, you
need to understand

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.710
reaction rate orders.

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.930
What they mean, how they
apply to reactions.

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.960
What a half life is and
how you use that.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.780
And the third thing is melting
points and how they are

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.040
related to intermolecular forces
and how intermolecular

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.070
forces affect melting points.

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.060
So review these three things and
once you've got them under

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.620
your belt then let's attempt
the problem.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.150
So let's start the problem.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.130
The first part is asking us to
determine the half life for a

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:17.660
particular reaction.

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.060
So there's two places
you could start.

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.330
We saw both answers.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.190
You could start with the
definition of half life.

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.190
If you've got it down on your
equation sheet, you could just

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.840
say, well I know this is the
equation which is the natural

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.640
log of the starting
concentration--

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:29.630
c naught--

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.430
divided by the current
concentration that you're

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.450
looking at-- c--

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:40.490
equals kt, where t is time and
k is your constant for k.

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.600
Or your reaction
rate constant.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.470
Or-- and this is the place
that I would recommend

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.680
starting because it's
universally useful to use for

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.940
doing kinetics problems
and also for

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:51.340
doing half life decays--

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.310
you start with your
rate equation.

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.380
This is a very general rate
equation, which I'm going to

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.360
show you how it can be
transformed to solve this very

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.240
simple problem.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:07.160
We're told here that we're
looking at the half life of a

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.810
particular reagent,
it's not listed.

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.310
And we're also told
that it falls by

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.710
factor of 11 in 11 minutes.

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:17.690
Because we're looking at one
material, we don't need two

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.110
different items. So we're
just going to look at a.

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.760
Let's forget about b.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:21.650
There's no b.

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.430
OK, we're just looking at
how a changes over time.

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:26.805
We're also told that
it's first order.

00:02:26.805 --> 00:02:28.930
So we're given this information
in the problem.

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:34.030
First order means that you
have an n equal to 1.

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:45.150
So n equals 1, which turns this
equation into k times the

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.980
concentration of species a.

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.930
We also know that rate is
nothing more than the changing

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.960
concentration with respect
to the change in time.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:59.510
So in calculus that
would be da / dt.

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.340
So looking at this now, we've
already got a differential

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.950
equation, which we can solve
and given certain boundary

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.100
conditions we can apply as
a naught as our starting

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.260
concentration, we can create
a new equation.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.940
So the way we're going to do
this is we're going to do the

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.050
calculus-- which I'm not going
to do for you here--

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:23.440
it's very simply you're going
to find this equation.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.740
This is all coming from the
very general rate equation

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:28.990
that we started with.

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:36.360
So there we are.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.680
That's where we're at and you'll
notice if I bring this

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.200
a to the other side, I take
the natural log, I put a

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.330
negative sign in there, I return
back to my original

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.440
equation that I sort
of luckily--

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.560
or didn't luckily-- have
on my equation sheet.

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.030
So now we've got
this equation.

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:51.760
And now we can actually go ahead
and solve the first part

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.850
of the problem very easily.

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:57.090
So I'm going to move
over here.

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.740
We're going to start off.

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:02.420
We're going to say we're told
that in 11 minutes we have now

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:05.440
1/11 of the concentration
we originally had.

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.030
So let me write that
mathematically for you.

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.930
I'm going to write a naught
as my starting

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.920
concentration of a.

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:21.510
So in 11 minutes we're going to
have 1/11 a naught a naught

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.510
e to the negative k.

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.490
And that occurs in 11 minutes.

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.200
Just express the statement
mathematically.

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.930
We've can cancel out these a
naughts so they don't matter.

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:33.180
Which is good because we
don't know what it is

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.250
in the first place.

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.770
And now we can rearrange this
equation pretty simply.

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.400
We can just do it as,
solve for k, our

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.160
reaction rate constant.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:48.530
That's going to be negative
1/11, natural log of 1/11.

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:49.550
That's k.

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.740
And now we have a value for k.

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.360
Now that we know the value
for k we can go back and

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.810
find the half life.

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:58.610
And half life is simply defined
very, very similar to

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:59.900
how we approached the problem
to begin with.

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:04.460
Half life is how long it takes
for the concentration to drop

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:07.270
from its original value to half
of that original value.

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:22.230
So let me write that now
in mathematical terms.

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:24.950
In this problem we know
k now but we don't

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:25.610
know the half life.

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:26.790
We don't know t 1/2.

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:29.450
I'm going to call it t 1/2 to
designate it and to mark it

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:31.220
differently than before.

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:33.660
Again we can cancel these off.

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:34.500
And now we can solve.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:35.540
Because we know k.

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:38.040
So let's plug in everything.

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:39.150
We can reverse everything.

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:40.590
So let me do that for you.

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:44.720
We're going to have this.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:57.810
Natural log of 1/2 being equal
to negative k, t to the 1/2.

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:01.980
And now we can solve for our t
1/2 because we know that k--

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:08.250
let's bring k to the
other side, and the

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:11.430
negative sign as well--

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:20.630
k is going to be negative
1/11 natural log 1/11.

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:23.560
We can then change natural log
1/2 into natural log 2.

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:26.110
That actually looks like our
original half life equation if

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:27.970
you had that on your
equation sheet.

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:32.090
So when you solve this out,
you're solving for t 1/2, t

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:39.330
1/2 the long and the short
of it is 3.18 minutes.

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:41.260
The main takeaway from this
problem is that you don't need

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.140
to have memorized any number
of equations to do it.

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:46.170
You can start from a very
general equation, which is the

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:48.980
rate equation, which we showed
in the beginning, and go from

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:51.930
there using logic and then just
mathematically represent

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:53.750
what the problem is telling you
to do in the first place.

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:55.780
So that's part A and that's the
majority of the points on

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:57.940
this problem.

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:01.100
Moving over, part B and C are
very quick, very short.

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:02.900
Just to check if you
know the facts.

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:04.280
Let's do them right now.

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:05.530
We're asking you--

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:12.140
we're going to do B 1
and B 2 together--

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:15.200
to tell us which one of
the compounds has a

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.840
higher boiling point.

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:19.970
And we give you two
different cases.

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:22.490
In each case there's
two compounds.

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:26.070
So number 1, you're given
silene and phosphene.

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:27.840
So the first thing you should
do is actually draw those

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:30.000
molecules out.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.250
So that's what I did.

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:36.080
Silene looks like this.

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:40.590
And then phosphene--

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:42.320
put the bonds in there--

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:43.899
phosphene looks something
like this.

00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:52.870
So now we have to sort of
identify which one of these

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:53.950
has a higher melting point.

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:56.650
Now in order to do that you need
to have reviewed and know

00:07:56.650 --> 00:07:59.640
that melting point is related
to the intermolecular forces

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:03.250
between the between
the molecules.

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:05.320
The forces between the molecules
are dependent on

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:08.150
both their geometry and
their chemistry.

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:11.670
So knowing that, if something
has stronger intermolecular

00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:14.320
bonds, it'll have a higher
melting point.

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:15.710
So let's take a look at
these two molecules.

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:18.610
Which one has stronger
intermolecular bonds?

00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:21.090
We have in silene case, we have
van der Waals forces,

00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:22.380
they're generally very weak.

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:24.890
We've got those tpo
for the phosphene.

00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:28.100
But in phosphene we additionally
have a dipole.

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:30.290
We have partial--

00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:37.360
we put maybe delta minus here
and delta plus here and here

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:38.150
on this side.

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:39.515
So our molecule is actually
polarized.

00:08:39.515 --> 00:08:42.020
There's a plus region
and a minus region.

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:44.610
And because of that you have
much stronger intermolecular

00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:47.640
forces between the phosphenes
then you do the silenes.

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:49.350
And because these have stronger
intermolecular

00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:54.750
forces, this one has a
higher melting point.

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:58.910
The last part of the
problem, part 2.

00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:01.330
We try to throw a little trick
in there with you.

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:03.600
We look at ammonia
and phosphene.

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:05.930
So now we're doing
NH3 and PH3.

00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:07.850
And they actually both
look identical in

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:09.310
terms of their geometry.

00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:10.560
So let me do that now.

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:15.710
It actually looks tetragonal
if you were to draw the

00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:17.910
structure out.

00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:22.450
There's ammonia and here's
our phosphene again.

00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:23.700
You can tell they
look the same.

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:28.930
So I think you have to sort of
reason out which one has the

00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:30.970
higher melting point, which is
the same thing as saying which

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:34.570
one has stronger intermolecular
forces.

00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:39.650
A very common answer we got
was that the nitrogen is a

00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:41.470
smaller atom, therefore
everything is held more

00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:43.830
closely, therefore the
forces are stronger.

00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:47.260
That's not really the answer
that is most dominant and it's

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.670
also not the answer we
were looking for.

00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:53.000
The correct answer here is that
even though both of these

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.080
have the same--

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:56.620
probably very similar-- van der
Waals forces, they're both

00:09:56.620 --> 00:10:01.560
polarized molecules, nitrogen
has hydrogen bonding.

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:03.450
So remember the hydrogen bonding
elements you should

00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:09.560
probably know are fluorine,
oxygen, chlorine, nitrogen,

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:11.220
four of them.

00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:14.080
So nitrogen will hydrogen bond,
which means that this

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:17.100
nitrogen will have a hydrogen
bond with some other ammonia

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:18.630
molecule over here.

00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:21.980
This H might be bonded to
an N somewhere else.

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:24.570
And because there are additional
hydrogen bonding

00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:27.070
force in the system, the
intermolecular forces are

00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:29.720
stronger and more prevalent in
ammonia, which means that

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:33.065
ammonia will have a higher
boiling point, which is true.

00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:37.500
The answer here is ammonia.

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:40.540
So all you have to take way
from this is that the

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:44.140
mechanical properties as well
as the melting and boiling

00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:47.030
properties of a material are
very much governed by the

00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:50.610
intermolecular forces that
exist in that particular

00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:53.040
material, that the liquid
or the solid state.

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:56.890
And so in this case we're
looking at these compounds and

00:10:56.890 --> 00:11:00.040
we've identified this one as
being a higher melting point

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:02.740
because it has a polarity
whereas this one doesn't.

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:06.330
And in this case where we try to
trick you up, we identified

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:07.790
that nitrogen has
this additional

00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:09.210
hydrogen bonding force.

00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:11.430
And that's all there is to it.
