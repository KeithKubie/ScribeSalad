around by the Christmas tree and answer

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090
around by the Christmas tree and answer
 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:42.560
around by the Christmas tree and answer
some questions let's go

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570
 
 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.779
 
[Music]

00:00:46.779 --> 00:00:46.789
 
 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:49.040
 
but one of the common questions I get is

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050
but one of the common questions I get is
 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.439
but one of the common questions I get is
where did I learn how to do the stuff

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449
where did I learn how to do the stuff
 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.930
where did I learn how to do the stuff
that I do did I go to school did I have

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940
that I do did I go to school did I have
 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.819
that I do did I go to school did I have
an apprenticeship and the answer is no I

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829
an apprenticeship and the answer is no I
 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.889
an apprenticeship and the answer is no I
did go to film school back in the mid

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899
did go to film school back in the mid
 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.959
did go to film school back in the mid
90s at Columbia College and I studied

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969
90s at Columbia College and I studied
 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.119
90s at Columbia College and I studied
film and animation which is kind of I

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129
film and animation which is kind of I
 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.469
film and animation which is kind of I
had already done a little bit of

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479
had already done a little bit of
 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.179
had already done a little bit of
stop-motion animation in high school and

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189
stop-motion animation in high school and
 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.310
stop-motion animation in high school and
some cel animation in high school and

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320
some cel animation in high school and
 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.740
some cel animation in high school and
that was kind of propelled me to go to

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750
that was kind of propelled me to go to
 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.859
that was kind of propelled me to go to
college and study it further and getting

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869
college and study it further and getting
 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.810
college and study it further and getting
into that aspect of it I really was into

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820
into that aspect of it I really was into
 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.280
into that aspect of it I really was into
stop-motion animation and building

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290
stop-motion animation and building
 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.330
stop-motion animation and building
puppets and I thought that that would be

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340
puppets and I thought that that would be
 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.820
puppets and I thought that that would be
maybe what I did but I was also into

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830
maybe what I did but I was also into
 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.140
maybe what I did but I was also into
acting and straight up filmmaking so I

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150
acting and straight up filmmaking so I
 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.219
acting and straight up filmmaking so I
would get involved in other people's

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229
would get involved in other people's
 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.660
would get involved in other people's
projects or I was starting my own

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670
projects or I was starting my own
 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.200
projects or I was starting my own
projects and often the one thing that we

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210
projects and often the one thing that we
 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.620
projects and often the one thing that we
needed was props or costumes or set

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630
needed was props or costumes or set
 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:40.880
needed was props or costumes or set
pieces and I always felt that those

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890
pieces and I always felt that those
 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.289
pieces and I always felt that those
things were very important helping to

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299
things were very important helping to
 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.249
things were very important helping to
tell a story so I generally would just

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259
tell a story so I generally would just
 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.870
tell a story so I generally would just
take those things upon myself to either

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880
take those things upon myself to either
 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.270
take those things upon myself to either
get those props or acquire them or if I

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280
get those props or acquire them or if I
 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.039
get those props or acquire them or if I
couldn't find them to make them somehow

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049
couldn't find them to make them somehow
 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.620
couldn't find them to make them somehow
so part of it was out of an interest to

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630
so part of it was out of an interest to
 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.800
so part of it was out of an interest to
do it and part of it was out of

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810
do it and part of it was out of
 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.660
do it and part of it was out of
necessity I guess I often took jobs in

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670
necessity I guess I often took jobs in
 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.270
necessity I guess I often took jobs in
maintenance and construction and odd

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280
maintenance and construction and odd
 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.219
maintenance and construction and odd
jobs here and there doing different

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229
jobs here and there doing different
 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.980
jobs here and there doing different
maintenance and so all those different

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990
maintenance and so all those different
 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.309
maintenance and so all those different
elements work

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:08.319
elements work
 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:10.229
elements work
a little bit electrical a little bit in

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239
a little bit electrical a little bit in
 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:12.989
a little bit electrical a little bit in
plumbing a little bit in HVAC a little

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:12.999
plumbing a little bit in HVAC a little
 

00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:14.520
plumbing a little bit in HVAC a little
bit of construction and building things

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530
bit of construction and building things
 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.589
bit of construction and building things
so all of those different elements over

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:16.599
so all of those different elements over
 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:18.720
so all of those different elements over
the years have been great resources to

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730
the years have been great resources to
 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.410
the years have been great resources to
pull from and I could also put that into

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420
pull from and I could also put that into
 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.199
pull from and I could also put that into
the art of creating sets and sculpting

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209
the art of creating sets and sculpting
 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:27.539
the art of creating sets and sculpting
things and making effects I've also

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:27.549
things and making effects I've also
 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:29.280
things and making effects I've also
always just had a real interest in

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290
always just had a real interest in
 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.949
always just had a real interest in
practical effects and I've always

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959
practical effects and I've always
 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:34.679
practical effects and I've always
thought that the costumes and props and

00:02:34.679 --> 00:02:34.689
thought that the costumes and props and
 

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:37.379
thought that the costumes and props and
sets really help tell the story and it

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:37.389
sets really help tell the story and it
 

00:02:37.389 --> 00:02:39.750
sets really help tell the story and it
also helps actors and filmmakers tell

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760
also helps actors and filmmakers tell
 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.699
also helps actors and filmmakers tell
their story if the things around them

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709
their story if the things around them
 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:43.709
their story if the things around them
make them feel like they're immersed

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:43.719
make them feel like they're immersed
 

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:45.959
make them feel like they're immersed
within that world so what is the one

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:45.969
within that world so what is the one
 

00:02:45.969 --> 00:02:47.899
within that world so what is the one
thing that I'm most proud of that I made

00:02:47.899 --> 00:02:47.909
thing that I'm most proud of that I made
 

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:51.360
thing that I'm most proud of that I made
either for Channel awesome or personal I

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370
either for Channel awesome or personal I
 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:52.890
either for Channel awesome or personal I
would say all of the work that we did

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900
would say all of the work that we did
 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.399
would say all of the work that we did

00:02:56.399 --> 00:02:56.409
for the Mad Max fury road review is
 

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:59.159
for the Mad Max fury road review is
probably my favorite I was really happy

00:02:59.159 --> 00:02:59.169
probably my favorite I was really happy
 

00:02:59.169 --> 00:03:00.750

the furiosa arm all of those elements I
 

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:13.140
the furiosa arm all of those elements I
had to build rather quickly with very

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150
had to build rather quickly with very
 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.629
had to build rather quickly with very
limited resources and despite that I

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:15.639
limited resources and despite that I
 

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:17.129
limited resources and despite that I
felt like they came out really well I

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:17.139
felt like they came out really well I
 

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:18.629

them feel like the character and that is
 

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:31.649
them feel like the character and that is
very gratifying when I know I can build

00:03:31.649 --> 00:03:31.659
very gratifying when I know I can build
 

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:33.899

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:01.359
that answers that question what the hell
 

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:04.050
that answers that question what the hell
