00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.790
One of the sections in the book you talk about,
um,

2
00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.430
I believe the person's name was lunchbox Lunchbucket lunch bucket once you got

3
00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:09.620
that right.
You know,

4
00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:15.030
since we're talking about work environments and there's that certain level of

5
00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.300
camaraderie and you actually talk about the seal teams in here where you just

6
00:00:18.301 --> 00:00:23.190
have this,
it's like a non,
and I've talked about this before in the seal teams,

7
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.600
it's nonstop,

8
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:30.000
hyper verbal abuse,
aggression around the clock,

9
00:00:30.001 --> 00:00:34.830
24 hours a day.
You're in a seal platoon.
Like that's the,
that's life.
Any,

10
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.530
any mistake that you make,
any,

11
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.010
any display of weakness is going to be past the part.

12
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.370
Oh,
it's going to be ripped apart.
And then if you get all irritated about that,

13
00:00:47.371 --> 00:00:51.890
it's even worse.
The nicknames,
you talked about lunch bucket,

14
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.430
your nickname was howdy,
howdy doody and them be shortened to howdy.

15
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.940
Which one was which you felt pretty good about it's better.
Yeah,

16
00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.560
because you went from howdy duty,
which is kind why I was so howdy,

17
00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.200
which is Kinda cool,
right?
Western guy and whatever.
But,

18
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.350
but the nicknames that,
that,
that are in the seal teams,

19
00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.980
like I can't with good conscience repeat them because they're just,

20
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.870
they're just horrible,
horrible names.

21
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.430
But there's a comradery around that.
And there's also the way,

22
00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.620
as I was reading what you had written about,

23
00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.700
these guys were working on a railroad railroad crew.
Yeah.
There is a test.

24
00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:28.140
It's a test.
It's a test to see where you're at.
It's retro of can we,

25
00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.770
can you,
can you,
can you tolerate a little bit of irritation?

26
00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.830
If the answer to that is no,
it's like,
well maybe we don't want you around then.

27
00:01:34.831 --> 00:01:38.130
Cause somebody irritating things are likely to come down the pipe.
Yeah.
And it's,

28
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.430
it's not just,
um,
to me,

29
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.160
to me it proves if you've got someone that can take it right.

30
00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.630
It's not just that they can take some random joking insults like they can,

31
00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.850
they can take it.
They can take it.
Yeah.
That's what you're testing for.
It's like,

32
00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:55.350
can you take it lunch bucket couldn't write because people would laugh at as

33
00:01:55.351 --> 00:01:57.600
lunch bucket and he'd get all upset.
It's like,

34
00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.200
well you have a stupid lunch pocket.
It's like,
you know your mom packed at,

35
00:02:01.201 --> 00:02:04.110
how about,
did you laugh at yourself?
Yeah,
my mom packed this.
I know.

36
00:02:04.111 --> 00:02:05.940
It's kind of stupid.
That would be the end of it.

37
00:02:05.941 --> 00:02:09.150
He would it just have to say that,
but I didn't want to hurt her feelings.

38
00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.500
It's like,
oh okay.
You know,
fine,
you got your stupid Lunchbucket.
But no,

39
00:02:13.501 --> 00:02:16.980
he couldn't handle that,
you know?
So yeah,
it was,
it was horrible.

40
00:02:16.981 --> 00:02:19.680
Had comical to watch at the same time because the level of,

41
00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.840
and people have written me about that and they said,
oh,
you know,

42
00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.080
poor Lunchbucket.
It's like,
cause they're all compassionate I think.
No,
no,

43
00:02:25.081 --> 00:02:29.550
not poor lunch bucket.
It's like clue the hail in buddy you had your chance.

44
00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:30.930
You know,
that was a desirable job,

45
00:02:30.931 --> 00:02:34.320
that rail crew job in the summer because it was high paying,
you know?

46
00:02:34.321 --> 00:02:36.360
And they weren't easy to come by those jobs.

47
00:02:36.361 --> 00:02:39.630
And so the fact that he got hired onto that crew was a real opportunity for him.

48
00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.500
You could make a pile of money in the summer at working on the rail crew and all

49
00:02:43.501 --> 00:02:48.000
you had to do was take some ribbing with good grace,

50
00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.360
not suck up to the management too badly and not have other people do your job.

51
00:02:53.881 --> 00:02:57.180
That was all,
that was all you had to do,
but he couldn't do that.

52
00:02:57.181 --> 00:03:00.460
And so he got run off and it was like,
grow the hell up buddy.

53
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.000
You know these guys win a hundred people are teasing you.

54
00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.990
Then probably they're not wrong

55
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.200
when you are getting teased like that as well.

56
00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.030
Well when you,
when you,
when you stop reacting,
it's no longer fun.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

57
00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.610
Who gives you an opportunity to tease back?
It's like this,
you can show your wit.

58
00:03:24.611 --> 00:03:27.250
And one of the things that working class guys in particular,

59
00:03:27.251 --> 00:03:30.310
which is one of the things I really loved about working class jobs is there,

60
00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:31.990
they're always looking for some humor.

61
00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.950
So it's like if person a is teasing person B,
that's kind of comical.

62
00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.480
But if person B comes back with a good zen back,
it's like,
that's even better.

63
00:03:40.481 --> 00:03:44.650
You know?
So I think that's a lot of how those jobs are rented.
Tolerable,
right?

64
00:03:44.651 --> 00:03:48.430
It's,
they're,
they're hard dirty jobs,
right?
Dishwasher's a good example.

65
00:03:48.431 --> 00:03:52.060
That's not dangerous.
Although cooking is,
Jeez,
you know,

66
00:03:52.061 --> 00:03:55.840
you gotta Watch your step.
I got burned a lot when I was cooking.
Um,

67
00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.520
but what makes those jobs not only tolerable,
but even desirable,

68
00:04:00.521 --> 00:04:03.940
is that you can develop a tremendous amount of camaraderie around them.

69
00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.840
I've never really experienced that at a professional level job that just doesn't

70
00:04:07.841 --> 00:04:11.710
happen the same way.
And it's really,
if there's a real loss in that.

71
00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:16.870
So it's,
it's,
it's fun to be part of a team that's doing,
you know,

72
00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.720
grubby hands on things and,

73
00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.530
and having a ridiculously entertaining,
vicious,

74
00:04:23.531 --> 00:04:27.560
cruel and evil time while you're doing it.
That's very entertaining.
The,

75
00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:32.320
this new kid's book I wrote,
so the kid mark,
he's getting made fun of by this.

76
00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.630
He's a different kind of bullies,
like a mental bullying that,

77
00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.750
that verbally abuses people.

78
00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:43.110
And he gets called plate face by this character and to eventually gets in

79
00:04:44.351 --> 00:04:47.410
trouble for throwing something at the kid because he's calling him plate face

80
00:04:47.411 --> 00:04:50.890
play there.
But eventually the way he befriends the kid is by heat.

81
00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.180
They have to do a self portrait class.

82
00:04:52.181 --> 00:04:55.600
And he draws a picture of himself looking like a plate and he shows up again.

83
00:04:55.601 --> 00:04:56.890
The kid laughs and all of a sudden their buddies.

84
00:04:56.891 --> 00:04:58.210
And it's like that's what you do.

85
00:04:58.211 --> 00:05:02.230
You take away that you take away the joy of,

86
00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:07.420
of being so heated and irritated by people that are making fun of you and you

87
00:05:07.421 --> 00:05:09.910
just kill it.
And Jujitsu in some sense.
Well,

88
00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.420
I had an experience with that about three years ago.

89
00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:17.830
I'd put my videos up online and people kept saying that I sounded like Kermit.

90
00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:21.220
And I thought,
well,
one person said it and I thought,
well,
whatever.

91
00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:23.770
But then like five people said it and I thought,
oh my God,

92
00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.920
like this Kermit thing.
So then I went and listened to Kermit and I thought,

93
00:05:26.921 --> 00:05:31.630
oh no.
It's like,
it's like,
really?
I really sound like Kermit,

94
00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:35.680
you know?
And so then,
well then I started to play with it a little bit.
You know,

95
00:05:35.681 --> 00:05:37.450
I used the puppet and when I,

96
00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:40.960
when I went to speak to university students and I made frog jokes and then I

97
00:05:40.961 --> 00:05:44.590
made a v I made a couple of videos that sort of featured me as a frog.

98
00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:48.820
And I mean,
it's crazy,
right?
It's ridiculous.
But,
but that's,
but,

99
00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:51.850
but the teasing never got mean because of that,
you know?

100
00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:55.090
And the same thing's happened online to a larger degree.

101
00:05:55.091 --> 00:05:58.070
As people keep making memes of me like,
and there's,
I don't know,

102
00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.100
there's lots of them.
There's way too many to even keep track of.

103
00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:03.830
And I was watching that happen and I thought,
okay,

104
00:06:03.831 --> 00:06:06.440
this is a good thing because there's humor and wherever there's humor,

105
00:06:06.441 --> 00:06:09.890
that's a good thing and they're making fun of me.
But it's gentle,
you know,

106
00:06:09.891 --> 00:06:13.490
most of it was pokey,
you know,
like,
well you sound like this damn puppet.

107
00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:14.900
What do you think of that?
It's like,
well,

108
00:06:14.901 --> 00:06:17.510
if I had to pick someone to sound like probably wouldn't be a puppet,

109
00:06:17.511 --> 00:06:21.260
but for that to be a puppet Kermit's not a bad one could be a lot worse.

110
00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:24.230
And I could be Miss Peggy.
And I couldn't be in that,
you know,

111
00:06:24.231 --> 00:06:29.210
so thank God that didn't happen.
But the memes have never got vicious because,

112
00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:30.201
you know,

113
00:06:30.201 --> 00:06:34.190
I'll post them if they're funny and satirical and then they won't get vicious

114
00:06:34.191 --> 00:06:37.370
because they don't have to.
It's like,
can we poke fun at you?
It's like,
yeah,

115
00:06:37.371 --> 00:06:39.200
please do.
And the more the better really,

116
00:06:39.201 --> 00:06:42.920
because that'll also help keep my feet on the ground and keep me awake.

117
00:06:42.921 --> 00:06:44.000
And plus it's funny.

118
00:06:44.001 --> 00:06:48.230
And like one of the things about life is that a sense of humor,

119
00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:49.610
that's a good thing to,

120
00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:53.690
to arm yourself with because sometimes you just don't have anything other than

121
00:06:53.691 --> 00:06:53.930
that.
