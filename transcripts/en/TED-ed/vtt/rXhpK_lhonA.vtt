00:00:07.169 --> 00:00:09.738
What do a seventeen-year-old Pakistani,

00:00:09.738 --> 00:00:11.773
a Norwegian explorer,

00:00:11.773 --> 00:00:13.277
a Tibetan monk,

00:00:13.277 --> 00:00:16.133
and an American pastor have in common?

00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:19.488
They were all awarded 
the Nobel Peace Prize.

00:00:19.488 --> 00:00:22.246
Among the top prestigious awards
in the world,

00:00:22.246 --> 00:00:24.765
this prize has honored 
some of the most celebrated

00:00:24.765 --> 00:00:29.872
and revered international figures
and organizations in history.

00:00:29.872 --> 00:00:34.896
To understand how it all got started,
we have to go back to the 1800s.

00:00:34.896 --> 00:00:36.843
Swedish chemist Alfred Nobel

00:00:36.843 --> 00:00:40.063
was then mostly known 
for the invention of dynamite,

00:00:40.063 --> 00:00:43.533
a breakthrough which launched his career
as a successful inventor

00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:45.552
and businessman.

00:00:45.552 --> 00:00:48.553
30 years later, he had become
extremely wealthy,

00:00:48.553 --> 00:00:49.844
but never married,

00:00:49.844 --> 00:00:51.913
and had no children.

00:00:51.913 --> 00:00:54.342
When his will was opened after his death,

00:00:54.342 --> 00:00:58.894
it came as a surprise that his fortune
was to be used for five prizes

00:00:58.894 --> 00:01:04.283
in physics, chemistry, 
medicine, literature, and peace.

00:01:04.283 --> 00:01:08.043
These prizes illustrated his lifelong
commitment to sciences

00:01:08.043 --> 00:01:10.274
and his passion for literature.

00:01:10.274 --> 00:01:12.194
But what about peace?

00:01:12.194 --> 00:01:16.455
Because Nobel's name was tied
to inventions used in the war industry,

00:01:16.455 --> 00:01:21.303
many have assumed that he created 
the peace prize out of regret.

00:01:21.303 --> 00:01:25.505
However, this is all speculation
as he never expressed any such sentiments,

00:01:25.505 --> 00:01:29.775
and his inventions were also used
for constructive purposes.

00:01:29.775 --> 00:01:34.113
Instead, many historians connect Alfred
Nobel's interest for the peace cause

00:01:34.113 --> 00:01:37.095
to his decade-long friendship 
and correspondence

00:01:37.095 --> 00:01:41.384
with an Austrian pacifist 
named Bertha Von Suttner.

00:01:41.384 --> 00:01:44.865
Von Suttner was one of the leaders
of the international peace movement,

00:01:44.865 --> 00:01:47.846
and in 1905, after Nobel's death,

00:01:47.846 --> 00:01:52.295
she became the first woman
to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.

00:01:52.295 --> 00:01:55.644
Nobel's will outlined three criteria
for the Peace Prize,

00:01:55.644 --> 00:01:58.345
which unlike the other 
Sweden-based prizes,

00:01:58.345 --> 00:02:00.815
would be administered in Norway.

00:02:00.815 --> 00:02:04.735
Disarmament, peace congresses,
and brotherhood between nations.

00:02:04.735 --> 00:02:07.035
These standards have since been expanded

00:02:07.035 --> 00:02:09.776
to include 
other ways of promoting peace,

00:02:09.776 --> 00:02:12.635
such as human rights and negotiations.

00:02:12.635 --> 00:02:15.636
And the prize doesn't just have to go
to one person.

00:02:15.636 --> 00:02:18.895
About a third of Noble Peace Prizes
have been shared

00:02:18.895 --> 00:02:21.218
by two or three laureates.

00:02:21.218 --> 00:02:24.126
So how do nominations for the prize work?

00:02:24.126 --> 00:02:25.876
According to the Nobel Foundation,

00:02:25.876 --> 00:02:29.356
a valid nomination can come from
a member of a national assembly,

00:02:29.356 --> 00:02:30.616
state government,

00:02:30.616 --> 00:02:32.596
or an international court.

00:02:32.596 --> 00:02:35.657
Eligible nominators also include
university rectors,

00:02:35.657 --> 00:02:41.536
professors of the social sciences, 
history, philosophy, law, and theology,

00:02:41.536 --> 00:02:44.777
and previous recipients 
of the Peace Prize.

00:02:44.777 --> 00:02:47.747
But if you want to know more about
who was recently nominated,

00:02:47.747 --> 00:02:49.206
you'll have to be patient.

00:02:49.206 --> 00:02:53.825
All information about nominations
remains secret for 50 years.

00:02:53.825 --> 00:02:56.354
Take Martin Luther King Jr.

00:02:56.354 --> 00:03:01.128
We didn't actually know who nominated him
until 2014.

00:03:01.128 --> 00:03:03.407
His nominators turned out 
to be the Quakers,

00:03:03.407 --> 00:03:05.157
who had won the prize previously,

00:03:05.157 --> 00:03:08.926
and eight members 
of the Swedish Parliament.

00:03:08.926 --> 00:03:13.439
There's no limit to the number of times
a person or organization can be nominated.

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:15.257
In fact, Jane Addams,

00:03:15.257 --> 00:03:18.879
recognized as the founder 
of social work in the United States,

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:24.167
was nominated 91 times before
finally being awarded the prize.

00:03:24.167 --> 00:03:28.307
The absence of a laureate can also
be symbolic.

00:03:28.307 --> 00:03:33.108
The 1948 decision not to award the prize
following the death of Mahatma Gandhi

00:03:33.108 --> 00:03:36.489
has been interpreted as an attempt
to respectfully honor

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:39.839
the so-called missing laureate.

00:03:39.839 --> 00:03:41.564
As with the other Nobel Prizes,

00:03:41.564 --> 00:03:45.249
the Peace Prize can't be 
awarded posthumously.

00:03:45.249 --> 00:03:48.058
The secret selection process 
takes almost a year,

00:03:48.058 --> 00:03:50.690
and is carried out by 
the five appointed members

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:53.078
of the Norwegian Nobel Committee

00:03:53.078 --> 00:03:58.119
who are forbidden from having
any official political function in Norway.

00:03:58.119 --> 00:04:00.408
Starting with a large pool of nominations,

00:04:00.408 --> 00:04:03.010
exceeding 300 in recent years,

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.771
they access each candidate's work
and create a short list.

00:04:06.771 --> 00:04:09.357
Finally, the chairman 
of the Nobel Committee

00:04:09.357 --> 00:04:12.508
publicly announces 
the laureate in October.

00:04:12.508 --> 00:04:16.487
The awards ceremony takes place
on December 10th,

00:04:16.487 --> 00:04:19.129
the anniversary of Alfred Nobel's death.

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:21.490
The prize itself includes a gold medal

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:26.540
inscribed with the Latin words,
"Pro pace et fraternitate gentium,"

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.935
or "For the peace and brotherhood of men,"

00:04:29.935 --> 00:04:33.620
as well as a diploma 
and a large cash prize.

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.154
Recently, it's been 
8 million Swedish kronor,

00:04:36.154 --> 00:04:38.639
or roughly a million US dollars,

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:41.772
which is split in the case 
of multiple laureates.

00:04:41.772 --> 00:04:44.682
And while laureates can use the prize
money as they choose,

00:04:44.682 --> 00:04:50.560
in recent years, many have donated it
to humanitarian or social causes.

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.770
For many years, the Nobel Peace Prize
was predominately awarded

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.550
to European and North American men.

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.692
But in recent years, significant changes
have been taking place,

00:04:59.692 --> 00:05:02.801
making the prize more global than ever.

00:05:02.801 --> 00:05:06.351
23 organizations and 103 individuals,

00:05:06.351 --> 00:05:09.091
that's 87 men and 16 women,

00:05:09.091 --> 00:05:13.963
have made up the 126 Nobel Peace Prize 
laureates in history.

00:05:13.963 --> 00:05:19.261
They include Desmond Tutu for his
nonviolent campaign against apartheid

00:05:19.261 --> 00:05:21.390
in South Africa,

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:26.924
Jody Williams for her campaign to ban
and clear anti-personnel mines,

00:05:26.924 --> 00:05:31.622
Rigoberta MenchÃº Tum for her work
for social justice and reconciliation

00:05:31.622 --> 00:05:35.581
based on respect for the rights
of indigenous peoples,

00:05:35.581 --> 00:05:40.102
Martti Ahtisaari for his efforts
to resolve international conflicts

00:05:40.102 --> 00:05:43.402
in Namibia, Kosovo, and Indonesia,

00:05:43.402 --> 00:05:47.403
and Aung San Suu Kyi for her nonviolent
struggle for democracy

00:05:47.403 --> 00:05:50.123
and human rights in Myanmar.

00:05:50.123 --> 00:05:53.032
They're just a few examples of the people
who have inspired us,

00:05:53.032 --> 00:05:54.232
challenged us,

00:05:54.232 --> 00:05:56.151
and demonstrated through their actions

00:05:56.151 --> 00:05:58.372
that there are many paths to peace.
