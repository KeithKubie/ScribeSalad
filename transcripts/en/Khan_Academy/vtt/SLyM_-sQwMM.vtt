00:00:00.214 --> 00:00:01.921
- [Voiceover] So we have
a circle right over here

00:00:01.921 --> 00:00:03.639
and the first question we'll ask ourselves

00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:06.693
is what are the coordinates
of the center of that circle?

00:00:06.693 --> 00:00:09.446
Well, we can eyeball that,

00:00:09.446 --> 00:00:12.073
we can see, look, it looks like the circle

00:00:12.073 --> 00:00:14.209
is centered on that point right over there

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:15.570
and the coordinates of that point,

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.950
the x-coordinate is negative four

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:20.377
and the y-coordinate is negative seven.

00:00:20.377 --> 00:00:24.984
So the center of that
circle would be the point

00:00:24.984 --> 00:00:27.236
negative four comma negative seven.

00:00:27.236 --> 00:00:30.700
Now let's say, on top of
that, someone were to tell us,

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.533
someone were to tell us,

00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:35.447
that this point, negative
five comma negative nine

00:00:35.447 --> 00:00:37.258
is also on the circle.

00:00:37.258 --> 00:00:39.964
So negative five

00:00:40.964 --> 00:00:42.438
comma negative nine

00:00:42.438 --> 00:00:46.311
is on the circle.

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.739
So based on this information,

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:50.921
the coordinate of the center and a point

00:00:50.921 --> 00:00:54.254
that sits on the circle, can
we figure out the radius?

00:00:54.254 --> 00:00:56.356
Well the radius is just
the distance between

00:00:56.356 --> 00:00:59.363
the center of the circle
and any point on the circle.

00:00:59.363 --> 00:01:01.789
In fact, one of the most
typical definitions of a circle

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:04.922
is all of the points that
are the same distance,

00:01:04.922 --> 00:01:09.080
or that are the radius
away from another point,

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.971
and that other point would
be the center of the circle.

00:01:12.971 --> 00:01:14.887
So how do we find out the distance

00:01:14.887 --> 00:01:17.778
between these two points,

00:01:17.778 --> 00:01:20.901
between these two points?

00:01:20.901 --> 00:01:23.002
So the length of that orange line.

00:01:23.002 --> 00:01:25.057
Well we can use the distance formula,

00:01:25.057 --> 00:01:27.716
which is essentially
the Pythagorean theorem.

00:01:27.716 --> 00:01:32.035
The distance squared,
so if the length of that

00:01:32.035 --> 00:01:35.288
is the distance, so we could
say the distance squared

00:01:35.288 --> 00:01:37.006
is going to be equal to,

00:01:37.006 --> 00:01:39.363
is going to be equal to

00:01:39.363 --> 00:01:42.858
our change in x squared,
so that right there

00:01:42.858 --> 00:01:45.168
is our change in x, and I
have to write really small,

00:01:45.168 --> 00:01:46.898
but that's our change in x,

00:01:46.898 --> 00:01:51.898
our change in x squared,
plus our change in y squared.

00:01:52.204 --> 00:01:55.536
Our change in y squared.

00:01:55.536 --> 00:01:58.578
Change in y squared.

00:01:58.578 --> 00:02:00.888
Now what is our change in x?

00:02:00.888 --> 00:02:04.348
Our change in x, and you
can even eyeball it here,

00:02:04.348 --> 00:02:06.647
it looks like it's one,
but let's verify it.

00:02:08.007 --> 00:02:10.379
It doesn't matter which one,
just use the start or the end,

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:11.819
as long as you're consistent.

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.245
So, let's see, if we view this as the end,

00:02:14.245 --> 00:02:15.990
we'd say negative five

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.560
it'd be negative five,

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:18.990
minus negative four

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.850
minus negative four

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.381
And so this would be
equal to negative one.

00:02:24.381 --> 00:02:27.469
So when you go from the
center to this outer point,

00:02:27.469 --> 00:02:31.010
negative five comma negative nine,

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.320
you go one back in the x direction.

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.803
Now the actual distance would
just be the absolute value

00:02:36.803 --> 00:02:39.032
of that, but it doesn't
matter that this is a negative

00:02:39.032 --> 00:02:40.923
because we're about to square
it and so that negative sign

00:02:40.923 --> 00:02:42.202
will go away.

00:02:42.202 --> 00:02:43.726
Now what is our change in y?

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.085
Our change in y.

00:02:46.706 --> 00:02:49.618
Well, this is the
finishing y, negative nine

00:02:49.618 --> 00:02:54.067
minus negative seven,

00:02:55.588 --> 00:02:57.033
minus our initial y

00:02:57.033 --> 00:02:59.006
is equal to negative two.

00:02:59.006 --> 00:03:00.249
And notice, just to go from that point,

00:03:00.249 --> 00:03:02.675
that y to that y, we go to negative two.

00:03:02.675 --> 00:03:04.568
So actually, we could call
the length of that side

00:03:04.568 --> 00:03:07.038
as the absolute value of our change in y.

00:03:07.038 --> 00:03:09.209
And we could view this
as the absolute value

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:10.404
of our change in x.

00:03:10.404 --> 00:03:12.309
And it doesn't really matter
because once we square them

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:13.945
the negatives go away.

00:03:13.945 --> 00:03:15.233
So our distance squared,

00:03:15.233 --> 00:03:17.123
our distance squared,

00:03:17.123 --> 00:03:19.199
I really could call
this the radius squared,

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:21.591
is going to be equal to
our change in x squared.

00:03:21.591 --> 00:03:23.437
Well, it's negative one squared,

00:03:23.437 --> 00:03:25.782
which is just going to be one

00:03:25.782 --> 00:03:29.971
plus our change in y
squared, negative two squared

00:03:29.971 --> 00:03:32.167
is just positive four.

00:03:32.167 --> 00:03:35.383
One plus four, and so you
have your distance squared

00:03:35.383 --> 00:03:38.100
is equal to five

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.478
or that the distance is equal
to the square root of five.

00:03:41.478 --> 00:03:43.452
And I could have just called
this variable the radius,

00:03:43.452 --> 00:03:45.263
so we could say the radius is equal to

00:03:45.263 --> 00:03:47.771
the square root of five.

00:03:47.771 --> 00:03:48.938
And we're done.
