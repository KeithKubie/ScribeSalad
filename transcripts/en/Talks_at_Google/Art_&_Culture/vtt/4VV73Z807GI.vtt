[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.844 --> 00:00:08.279
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:08.279 --> 00:00:11.690
AMANDA PHINGBODHIPAKKIYA:
Thanks so much, [? Theresa. ?]

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:12.750
Hello, everyone.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.190
It's so wonderful to be here.

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.850
Thank you for having me.

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:18.590
I'm going to start
off with a story.

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.780
And it begins, as all good
stories, do on Amtrak.

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:27.560
So it was the end of 2016, and
I was traveling from Boston

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:28.670
to New York.

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:30.980
I just spent Christmas
with my partner's family,

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.700
and we were all still just
processing the results

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.040
of the November election.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.080
One of my good
friends told me that I

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.870
should pick a cause that
I care deeply about,

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.490
and support it in a
way that only I could.

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:48.740
So I thought back to one of
my childhood heroes, Rita

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.800
Levi-Montalcini, who
discovered nerve growth

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.200
factor in the 1940s.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.840
Her initial discovery wasn't
at the University of Turin,

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.700
but actually in a
makeshift laboratory

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.070
she'd set up in her
bedroom after Mussolini

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.750
had barred Jewish people from
working in academic settings.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.760
I knew there were
other women like her

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.660
who had made significant
improvements to their fields.

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.430
But I was drawing a blank.

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.890
The only other name
that came to mind

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.100
was a legendary
scientist, Marie Curie.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.840
So I started Beyond Curie,
a series of illustrations

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.990
and stories that celebrates the
rich history of women kicking

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:32.300
ass in science, technology,
engineering, and mathematics--

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.440
women like Maryam Mirzakhani
and Mary Golda Ross.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.420
I started it so that
young women everywhere

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.700
could stop wondering if
they had the potential

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.840
to make an impact in STEM,
and instead start asking,

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.840
why should we stop now?

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.540
The project was funded by a
Kickstarter campaign, which

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.700
attracted hundreds of backers--

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.420
parents, teachers,
engineers, and scientists--

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.100
who wanted the
women in their lives

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.940
to be inspired by
that same legacy.

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.250
In partnership with the
March for Science organizers.

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.290
I released a special
series of posters

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:11.080
that anyone could download and
print for a rally or protest.

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.150
And a couple of months later, I
headed down to Washington, DC,

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.520
along with thousands
of others, and we stood

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.670
huddled under our umbrellas
on that wet, dreary day,

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.190
taking to the streets
of the nation's capital

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.680
to stand up for science.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.870
And that's when I saw
her, a woman carrying

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.916
a huge bedazzled Beyond Curie
poster of Rosalind Franklin,

00:02:30.916 --> 00:02:32.915
the scientist who had
made crucial contributions

00:02:32.915 --> 00:02:36.410
to the understanding of
DNA's double helix structure.

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:37.910
It was the same
poster that I had

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.710
brought with me to the march.

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.140
She told me that she
was getting her PhD

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.170
and had flown into
DC from South Dakota.

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.020
For her, the poster
was a powerful reminder

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:52.960
that women belong in the
lab just as much as men do.

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.550
Now, as I've continued
to work on Beyond Curie,

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.560
I've gone deeper and
deeper into the lives

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.160
of these incredible women and
their groundbreaking work.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.100
How were they able to push
through when others weren't?

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.190
What methods did they
use to gain new insights

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.070
and get their work recognized
in a male-dominated field?

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:12.890
And how can these
lessons be transferred

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.160
outside of the realm of deep
scientific and engineering

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.460
research and into the
lives of the rest of us?

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:22.220
Today, I want to share with
you the stories of four

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.520
of these women featured in
the Beyond Curie series--

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.600
exploring how their work
unfolded, and a little bit more

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.730
about their personalities.

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.430
This first lesson is about
what to do when you have

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.470
a truly groundbreaking idea.

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.000
We live in an era
where innovators

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.820
have brought brilliant
and sometimes devastating

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.160
inventions and breakthroughs
into the world,

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.440
but not all ideas
are immediately

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.930
ready for the limelight.

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:52.310
So what do you do?

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.980
If you bury it,
are you giving up?

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:56.720
No one wants to be a quitter.

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.500
But if you push for it as
a lone voice in the wild,

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.760
you might just get
cast out and ignored,

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.750
which means your work never
gets the impact it deserves.

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:11.160
This is a story of
staying in the game.

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:17.100
Barbara McClintock
was born in 1902.

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.310
She spent most of her
childhood in Brooklyn,

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:25.260
and her parents early on noted
her solitary and independent

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.620
streak, discarding the
name Eleanor, the name they

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.080
had initially intended
on giving her as being

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.900
too delicate and feminine.

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.060
She found her love for
science in high school,

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.060
and was accepted later
into Cornell's College

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.820
of Agriculture, where she
earned a bachelors and then

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.540
a PhD in botany,
focusing on maize.

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.610
That's the grain with
the multicolored kernels,

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:49.320
also known as Indian corn.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:57.290
So after postdocs at Caltech
and the University of Missouri,

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:59.060
where she made
crucial contributions

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:04.550
to the understanding of
genetic replication in maize,

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:08.960
she accepted a faculty position
at Cold Springs Harbor in 1942.

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.440
And it was there at this
leading biomedical facility

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:19.280
in upstate New York that
she made her groundbreaking

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:20.440
discoveries in genetics.

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:29.540
Now, it all started
with a simple question.

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:33.440
Why does maize have
differently colored kernels?

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:34.480
Some of them are yellow.

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:35.480
Some of them are purple.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:39.500
Sometimes there's this
weird mosaic pattern.

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:40.340
Why is that?

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.440
The scientific
consensus at the time

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:45.620
was that genetic
replication in genes

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.030
were ordered in a fixed pattern.

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:49.880
So that meant that
theoretically, from ear to ear,

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:53.570
maize should have
similar coloring.

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:57.230
So Barbara developed some of
these amazing X-ray techniques

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:01.920
to induce mutations in cells.

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:04.400
And she noticed that
different segments of DNA

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.400
would jump around the
chromosomes when this happened.

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.590
She also noticed that
other segments of DNA

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:12.470
would turn genes on and off.

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:17.810
Her findings led to a theory
about the uneven coloring

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:19.650
in maize kernels.

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:23.240
So if a piece of DNA was
dropped into a segment that

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:27.530
coded for purple pigment, it
might disrupt that pigmentation

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:29.660
and cause a mosaic kernel.

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:32.610
If it was dropped into a segment
that turned genes on and off,

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:37.780
it might result in a
non-pigmented yellow kernel.

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:40.030
McClintock was a highly
respected scientist,

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:43.030
and her peers in botany
appreciated the work

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:43.990
that she was doing.

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:47.170
But other scientists, they
thought she was crazy.

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:50.080
They responded with
puzzlement and even hostility,

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:51.880
as she described it.

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:56.950
She gave a big talk in
1951 summarizing a paper

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:59.620
that she had written
for a major symposium.

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:02.260
The room goes dead silent.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.734
Talk about a tough crowd.

00:07:05.734 --> 00:07:07.150
But it didn't
bother her too much.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.680
She said, it didn't
bother me that much,

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:15.320
because when you
know you're right,

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:19.520
you know that sooner or later,
it will come out in the wash.

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:22.550
So she continues to
publish her work on maize.

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:25.280
But after years, and years,
and years of resistance,

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:27.550
she starts moving
on to other areas.

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:32.480
She does seminal work on
evolutionary pathways of maize,

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:38.150
and she travels to Central and
South America to do this work.

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:41.150
At the same time, the field
of genetics moves forward.

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:44.780
Other scientists start to see
this jumping gene phenomenon

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:46.640
in bacteria and yeast.

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:52.490
Also advances in
technology improve.

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:54.080
So now they're
able to understand

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:55.280
exactly what's happening.

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:59.390
They realize that McClintock's
weird corn breeding

00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:02.690
research is actually
fundamental to genetics,

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:06.470
and it's really a foundation
for all of these other fields,

00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:13.350
and has implications for
every biomedical field.

00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:17.870
She's the first person to
win the MacArthur Genius

00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:20.660
grant, the first woman
to receive the National

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:27.330
Medal of Science, and
finally, after over 30 years,

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:31.430
she's given the Nobel Prize
in physiology and medicine.

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:34.940
She is the first American
woman to win an unshared Nobel

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:37.880
Prize in any category.

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:40.460
She also gets a building
named after her at Cold Spring

00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:41.960
Harbor, which is cool too.

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:48.980
So McClintock isn't the only
one who had to wait years

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:50.570
to get her work recognized.

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:59.050
In 2017, the MeToo movement
brought down Harvey Weinstein,

00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:02.590
and reverberated across the
country and around the world,

00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:04.360
irreversibly changing
the conversation

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:05.950
around sexual harassment.

00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:09.190
But its origins began
more than a decade earlier

00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:12.010
with the work of social
activist and community

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:14.770
organizer, Tarana Burke.

00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:17.110
Born in the Bronx to a
low-income household,

00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:21.820
she experienced sexual violence
as a girl and young woman.

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:24.670
In 2003, she started a
nonprofit called Just

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:30.040
Be that developed programming
for young black girls and teens

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:35.340
to succeed socially
and professionally.

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:39.060
She first used the phrase
"me too" on Myspace

00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:43.620
as part of the campaign
to promote empowerment

00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:49.290
through empathy among
survivors of sexual abuse.

00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:51.660
This campaign became
so important to her

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:58.140
that in 2008, she renamed
her nonprofit Me Too.

00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:00.180
She continued this
community work traveling

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:05.310
to Brooklyn and Selma.

00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:12.210
And then on October 15th, 2017,
Alyssa Milano posted on Twitter

00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:14.520
about #MeToo for the
first time, and it

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:17.640
received 24,000 retweets,
and set off a tidal wave

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:20.940
that continues to this day.

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:23.970
Later on, Milano
followed up that tweet,

00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:25.950
crediting Burke
with her earlier use

00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:28.320
of the phrase and her
longstanding efforts

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:31.260
to support survivors
of sexual abuse.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.650
Tarana Burke went on to be named
one of Time Magazine's silence

00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:38.820
breakers, which Time Magazine
named 2017 person of the year.

00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:41.070
And she was this year's
commencement speaker

00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:46.470
at U Penn's School of
Social Policy and Practice.

00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:50.760
McClintock's and Burke's
stories, they share parallels,

00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:53.130
including their initial
rise in the field.

00:10:55.950 --> 00:10:59.940
McClintock's early maize work
was considered first rate,

00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:03.930
and Burke had started
her community activism

00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:07.560
as a young girl, and continued
it wherever she went.

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:10.230
They also both had
a breakthrough idea.

00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:13.800
For McClintock, it was
that genetic regulation

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:15.660
could be controlled.

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:18.900
For Burke, it was
that one of the ways

00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:22.200
to help survivors
heal and communicate

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:25.500
the awful prevalence
of sexual abuse

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:29.100
is to share one's own story.

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:32.010
And for both of
them, it took years

00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:35.010
of working on other things,
putting their initial idea

00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:38.014
aside, and waiting until
the world was ready for them

00:11:38.014 --> 00:11:39.555
to get the recognition
they deserved.

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:47.290
It takes some time for
ideas to permeate the world.

00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:50.060
And yeah, it probably
was much harder for them

00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:52.310
because they were women.

00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:55.780
But by making their mark
and staying in the game,

00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:59.770
their fields were able to
recognize the importance

00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:01.120
of their contributions.

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:05.690
The next lesson
that I think we can

00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:07.910
learn from leading
scientists is that the world

00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:10.040
needs more champions.

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:12.080
Women are often
given the advice,

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:17.720
go find a mentor, someone who's
had some more years on you

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:21.560
in the field and can
offer advice or approaches

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:23.410
to your work.

00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:25.610
But having a mentor
isn't enough.

00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:32.280
Women and ambitious people of
every stripe need champions.

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:35.090
And the surest way to understand
the difference between a mentor

00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:40.040
and a champion is to look at
Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol

00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:42.320
Greider.

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:47.490
So in the late 1970s
and early '80s,

00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:50.540
the field of molecular biology
was brimming with excitement.

00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:52.910
There were lots of advances
being made, including

00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:57.350
the discovery of telomeres,
which are repeating segments

00:12:57.350 --> 00:13:00.230
at the ends of chromosomes
that essentially protect

00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:04.370
them and keep them from
injecting bad or erroneous DNA

00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:06.566
during replication.

00:13:06.566 --> 00:13:09.170
So Elizabeth Blackburn
was a postdoc at the time.

00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:11.540
She was doing early
work on telomeres,

00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:14.930
actually studying
pond scum, because it

00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:17.810
was cheap and readily
available, and

00:13:17.810 --> 00:13:23.460
because cellular replication
is generally highly conserved,

00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:27.320
which means it's the same
in pond scum, and mammals,

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:30.390
and plants, and even humans.

00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:33.050
So she sets up her
lab at UC Berkeley,

00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:38.120
and in 1983, she recruits a
young University of San Diego

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:42.850
biology major,
named Carol Greider.

00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:45.650
So Greider had done
great in undergrad.

00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:50.000
She was already an accomplished
researcher in her own right,

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.830
and knew her way around the lab.

00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:54.980
But she suffered from
dyslexia, which meant

00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:56.810
she didn't really test well.

00:13:56.810 --> 00:13:59.410
So when it came time to
interview for her PhD program,

00:13:59.410 --> 00:14:02.820
she only got offers at
two places to interview,

00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:04.730
and one of them was UC Berkeley.

00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:07.800
After meeting with the team,
she said, you know what?

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:10.520
This seems like a great place
to do research and a great group

00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:12.530
of people to work with.

00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:14.300
She was all in.

00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:16.550
She worked 12-hour
days in the lab,

00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:19.190
learned all different kinds
of techniques on the fly,

00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:23.060
and engaged in a lot of
intense intellectual discussion

00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:24.780
with Blackburn.

00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:28.580
The duo hypothesized that
there was some kind of enzyme,

00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:32.540
a protein probably,
that would regulate

00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:38.810
this cellular replication
and control telomeres.

00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:43.170
Finally, after many, many
tests, around Christmas time,

00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:46.880
Carol comes rushing in with the
results of an experiment that

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:50.300
show an enzyme that
could potentially

00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:53.870
be the one that they
had hypothesized.

00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:58.260
Blackburn remembers this exact
moment and thinking, wow,

00:14:58.260 --> 00:14:59.230
this is something big.

00:15:02.650 --> 00:15:04.920
So eventually, Carol moves on.

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:10.050
She gets her PhD, goes on to
teach at Cold Springs Harbor,

00:15:10.050 --> 00:15:13.860
and then gets a faculty
position at Johns Hopkins,

00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:18.730
where she still does
research and teaches today.

00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:23.020
Then in 2009, she, Blackburn,
and a third scientist

00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:26.110
who had worked on the
early work of telomeres

00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:28.502
won the Nobel Prize in
Physiology and Medicine.

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:33.770
Blackburn wasn't a
mentor for Greider.

00:15:33.770 --> 00:15:35.490
She was her champion.

00:15:35.490 --> 00:15:36.860
She pushed Greider.

00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:42.170
She made sure that they
connected on a daily basis.

00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:43.940
This is uncommon
in grad programs.

00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:48.860
Usually principal
investigators touch base

00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:52.370
with their graduate
students maybe once a month.

00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:55.500
Blackburn also made sure
that Carol got credit

00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:57.500
for the discovery that
she made, even though she

00:15:57.500 --> 00:16:00.080
was only one year
out of undergrad

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:01.820
and a very young researcher--

00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:05.540
something that
Jocelyn Bell Burnell

00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:08.210
never got from her
principal investigator.

00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:09.980
Jocelyn discovered
the first pulsars,

00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:13.744
but instead of sharing credit,
her principal investigator

00:16:13.744 --> 00:16:14.410
took the credit.

00:16:17.490 --> 00:16:23.150
So the lesson is to find
champions and be a champion

00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:25.520
for others when you can.

00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:27.950
But easier said
than done, right?

00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:31.130
Wouldn't we all love to have
a brilliant, influential,

00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:34.070
encouraging leader who
is helping us do highly

00:16:34.070 --> 00:16:35.300
visible and impactful work?

00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:36.170
Of course.

00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:39.770
But how does this actually
happen in practice?

00:16:39.770 --> 00:16:45.170
One of the best examples is
from the Obama administration.

00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:47.420
A couple of years ago,
"The Washington Post"

00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:52.940
did a piece on Obama's first
term when 2/3 of his aides

00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:54.050
were men.

00:16:56.880 --> 00:17:00.180
So women had to elbow their
way to get into meetings.

00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:05.609
And when they were there, they
were talked over and ignored.

00:17:05.609 --> 00:17:08.040
So the women got
together and developed

00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:10.200
something called
amplification, where

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:12.900
when a woman made a key
point, other women would

00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:16.800
repeat it, and then
give that woman credit.

00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:19.500
This had the dual
impact of making sure

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:23.209
that their ideas and
their voices were heard,

00:17:23.209 --> 00:17:25.500
but also it made sure that
the men couldn't take credit

00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:27.480
for their ideas.

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:28.680
And it worked.

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:31.590
We saw Obama calling
more and more directly

00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:33.150
on the women in those meetings.

00:17:36.958 --> 00:17:43.730
Now my last story comes
from Asia, which is fitting,

00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:47.090
because I owe the opportunity
to give this talk to the Asian

00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:47.780
Google network.

00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:57.600
Youyou Tu is a Chinese
pharmaceutical chemist

00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:01.740
who led a team that
developed a breakthrough

00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:04.950
cure for tropical malaria,
for which she won the Nobel

00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:12.680
Prize in 2015.

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:17.450
Youyou Tu grew up in Ningbo,
which is about 120 miles south

00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:19.430
of Shanghai.

00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:24.110
And as a young child, she
developed a serious case

00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:27.470
of tuberculosis, which
actually inspired her

00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:29.000
to go into medical research.

00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:36.280
Now, she studied at
the Beijing University

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:40.480
School of Pharmacology,
and graduated in 1955.

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:46.690
A couple of years later in 1960,
the North Vietnamese leader,

00:18:46.690 --> 00:18:51.280
Ho Chi Minh, appealed
to his friend and ally,

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:54.340
the Chinese premier, for help.

00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:56.500
North Vietnamese
soldiers were dropping

00:18:56.500 --> 00:19:00.370
like flies from
tropical malaria,

00:19:00.370 --> 00:19:04.720
and the current cure, chloro
quinine, was ineffective.

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:07.750
It just so happened
that in Southern China,

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:10.210
lots of citizens were
dying from malaria as well.

00:19:10.210 --> 00:19:12.730
So the Chinese premier
asked Mao Zedong

00:19:12.730 --> 00:19:16.600
to set up a secret
government program called

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:19.030
Project 523 to discover a cure.

00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:24.730
It's not really that
original of a name,

00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:30.310
since it's after the date of
its founding, May 23, 1967.

00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:33.280
Regardless, they
recruited 500 scientists

00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:35.260
from all over the
country, different labs,

00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:39.530
and institutions, to participate
in the fight against malaria.

00:19:39.530 --> 00:19:42.710
Youyou Tu joins in 1969.

00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:45.370
She actually had to put her
young daughter in a nursery

00:19:45.370 --> 00:19:49.270
as she traveled
to Southern China

00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:52.758
to investigate
what was going on.

00:19:52.758 --> 00:19:55.030
So around the world,
other scientists

00:19:55.030 --> 00:19:56.620
are getting involved.

00:19:56.620 --> 00:20:00.310
They've tested over 240,000
different compounds for a cure,

00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:02.720
to no avail.

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:06.940
So Youyou Tu decides to
retread some old ground

00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:09.880
and go back and look at
traditional Chinese medicine.

00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:12.070
She travels around
the country, talking

00:20:12.070 --> 00:20:14.170
to different Chinese
medicine practitioners,

00:20:14.170 --> 00:20:16.280
compiling all of
her notes and all

00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:19.870
of this research
in a big notebook.

00:20:19.870 --> 00:20:23.140
By early 1971, she
and her team had

00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:27.370
tested over 2,000 recipes
from Chinese medicine,

00:20:27.370 --> 00:20:31.450
had extracted about 380 herbal
extracts from 200 herbs,

00:20:31.450 --> 00:20:32.500
and tested it on mice.

00:20:38.152 --> 00:20:40.610
Then they found
out that there was

00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:44.360
one compound from the sweet
wormwood plant that seemed

00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:48.140
like it might be a contender.

00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:51.680
This compound was known to
help with intermittent fevers,

00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:56.360
was a characteristic
of malaria, and also it

00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:58.370
proved to inhibit
parasite growth.

00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:03.250
So after testing it
on mice, Youyou Tu

00:21:03.250 --> 00:21:06.830
steps forward as the very
first human test subject.

00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:10.240
She actually tested it on
herself, which is incredible.

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:12.380
Fortunately, it's
safe for humans.

00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:13.240
It works.

00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:17.140
Patient trials continue,
which prove highly successful.

00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:21.340
But no one in the world knows
about this research because

00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:24.730
of the Cultural Revolution and
because this is a highly secret

00:21:24.730 --> 00:21:26.660
military project.

00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:30.700
But once these international
relations reopen,

00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:35.320
Youyou Tu is asked to present
the findings of Project 523

00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:37.360
to the World Health
Organization.

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:40.720
After that, more
folks start to use

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:45.970
artemisinin, which is what they
ended up calling this compound.

00:21:45.970 --> 00:21:51.020
And it's one of the frontline
tools against malaria.

00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:56.050
So between 2000 and 2012, the
global incidence of malaria

00:21:56.050 --> 00:21:59.830
drops 25%, and the global
mortality rate for malaria

00:21:59.830 --> 00:22:02.290
drops 42%.

00:22:02.290 --> 00:22:05.830
In a recent estimate, it's
said that her discovery

00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:11.660
of artemisinin has saved
hundreds of millions of lives.

00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:14.000
Pretty incredible, right?

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.460
So another woman who's not so
afraid to retread old ground

00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:22.580
to discover new insights
is former GE vice chair,

00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:25.510
Beth Comstock.

00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:29.620
Now, Comstock started
her career at NBC News

00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:32.320
as a journalist
in Washington, DC.

00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:34.870
A couple of years later,
she gets the opportunity

00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:38.920
to travel to New York for
new job opportunities.

00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:41.980
Despite having a small child
and being a single parent,

00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:43.810
she takes the leap.

00:22:43.810 --> 00:22:46.240
And this move to the
big city pays off.

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:50.860
She gets opportunities
at CNN and then at CBS,

00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:56.230
running East Coast PR
for the classiest network

00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:58.300
in the country.

00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:03.610
Then in 1993, she gets a
call to return back to NBC.

00:23:03.610 --> 00:23:05.380
They have an
opening for the vice

00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:08.740
president of media relations.

00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:12.520
But the problem is that
recently, NBC just got outed

00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:14.950
for running a fake news story.

00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:17.560
Morale was in the toilet.

00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:20.470
Resistance to her taking this
job, even considering it,

00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:23.290
started immediately
after she got the call.

00:23:23.290 --> 00:23:26.020
But she knew that
in her gut, this

00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:28.570
was the job for her to take.

00:23:28.570 --> 00:23:31.480
Something was calling
Comstock back to NBC.

00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:35.590
And she ended up following
her gut and being correct.

00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:37.570
They gave her a lot of latitude.

00:23:37.570 --> 00:23:40.510
She was able to experiment
and try new things.

00:23:40.510 --> 00:23:44.050
And two years later,
she launched MSNBC

00:23:44.050 --> 00:23:48.070
with the help of Jack
[? Welch ?] and Bill Gates.

00:23:48.070 --> 00:23:51.460
And it's now the second most
watched channel on cable news.

00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:58.940
Learning to retread old
ground to find new insights--

00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:04.660
it's a lesson that I used myself
in developing Beyond Curie.

00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:08.490
I would never have known
that my fourth grade book

00:24:08.490 --> 00:24:10.980
report on Rita
Levi-Montalcini would

00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:13.140
be the spark for a
project that would

00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:17.580
have such a global response,
lead to a main stage TED Talk,

00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:22.830
and also lead to a whole
highway tunnel dedicated

00:24:22.830 --> 00:24:25.110
to women in STEM.

00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:27.090
In fact, I didn't
even think I'd still

00:24:27.090 --> 00:24:29.100
be working on Beyond Curie.

00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:31.350
But I'm glad that I am.

00:24:31.350 --> 00:24:35.550
Beyond Curie is about
discovering our heroes,

00:24:35.550 --> 00:24:38.460
because when we're able
to connect with greatness,

00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:41.880
we come to see that it is
not some distant, unreachable

00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:44.790
place, but a long
body of work forged

00:24:44.790 --> 00:24:48.510
through perseverance,
love, and courage,

00:24:48.510 --> 00:24:50.340
because when we
truly know our past,

00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:52.350
we can reclaim our present.

00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:55.110
And when we hold the
present in our hands,

00:24:55.110 --> 00:24:58.260
the future is ours to shape.

00:24:58.260 --> 00:25:00.254
Thanks so much for listening.

00:25:00.254 --> 00:25:04.980
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:07.981
I guess we can open
up to questions.

00:25:07.981 --> 00:25:09.980
AUDIENCE: I noticed you
made multiple references

00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:11.810
to Cold Springs Harbor.

00:25:11.810 --> 00:25:16.250
Was that a coincidence, or was
there some reason for that?

00:25:16.250 --> 00:25:17.750
AMANDA PHINGBODHIPAKKIYA:
Well, it's

00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:19.790
a leading biomedical
institution,

00:25:19.790 --> 00:25:24.410
so a lot of people who have won
the Nobel Prize did work there.

00:25:24.410 --> 00:25:31.610
But I guess in this talk,
purely by coincidence.

00:25:31.610 --> 00:25:33.950
AUDIENCE: Could you talk
more about the format

00:25:33.950 --> 00:25:39.350
of this project, Beyond Curie,
and how can girls and women

00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:41.982
access it, and connect
to these messages

00:25:41.982 --> 00:25:43.190
that you're trying to convey?

00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:44.731
AMANDA PHINGBODHIPAKKIYA:
Absolutely.

00:25:44.731 --> 00:25:47.120
So it lives online
at beyondcurie.com.

00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:49.490
We do a lot of exhibits
around the country

00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:52.700
and around the world that
shows these portraits,

00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:56.300
gives a small little description
of what these scientists

00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:59.330
and technologists have
contributed to the world,

00:25:59.330 --> 00:26:03.690
and also there's an AR app in
the Apple and Android store.

00:26:07.374 --> 00:26:08.207
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:26:08.207 --> 00:26:09.061
AMANDA PHINGBODHIPAKKIYA: Sure.

00:26:09.061 --> 00:26:10.900
Oh, there's also a
Kickstarter that we're

00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:14.080
running right now
that's holiday cards,

00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:16.900
in case you're
interested in sharing

00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:18.700
these women for the holidays.

00:26:21.836 --> 00:26:23.960
AUDIENCE: Have you considered
working with schools,

00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:26.960
or are you working with
schools around the country,

00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:34.324
to encourage girls be made aware
of, and girls and boys, really?

00:26:34.324 --> 00:26:36.240
AMANDA PHINGBODHIPAKKIYA:
That's a great idea.

00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:39.120
We are working with
several schools.

00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:42.780
It's kind of come
about organically.

00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:45.890
We field a lot of
inbound from schools,

00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:49.100
and we donate a lot of
sets of these posters

00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:52.814
and little wall
decals for schools.

00:26:52.814 --> 00:26:54.230
But if you have
other suggestions,

00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:55.827
I'm definitely open.

00:26:55.827 --> 00:26:56.660
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:26:56.660 --> 00:26:59.060
AMANDA PHINGBODHIPAKKIYA: Sure.

00:26:59.060 --> 00:27:01.610
AUDIENCE: Can you share a little
more about your own journey

00:27:01.610 --> 00:27:06.260
from being a
neuroscientist to coming up

00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:10.370
with these works of art, and
how that took off, and turned

00:27:10.370 --> 00:27:13.220
into Beyond Curie as an
organization and everything?

00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:14.870
AMANDA PHINGBODHIPAKKIYA: Sure.

00:27:14.870 --> 00:27:19.430
So I realized that I was better
at communicating research

00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:22.490
and communicating science than
actually doing the science,

00:27:22.490 --> 00:27:24.210
and I could make
more impact there.

00:27:24.210 --> 00:27:28.700
So I got my MFA at
Pratt, and after that, I

00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:31.790
bounced around different art
director and creative director

00:27:31.790 --> 00:27:32.720
positions.

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:36.680
And then I got the
opportunity to do something

00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:40.400
called the TED Residency, which
is an incubator program where

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:45.160
you have some sort of idea worth
spreading that you apply with.

00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:47.630
Mine was that design can
shine a light on breakthroughs

00:27:47.630 --> 00:27:48.890
happening in science.

00:27:48.890 --> 00:27:52.660
And I actually incubated another
project, not Beyond Curie,

00:27:52.660 --> 00:27:53.860
there.

00:27:53.860 --> 00:27:56.330
It's a program that pairs
scientists and designers

00:27:56.330 --> 00:28:00.500
to cocreate works of art and
design that translate research.

00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:04.070
And we put out pop-up exhibits
all over the country and work

00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:07.430
with different institutions.

00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:10.040
Beyond Curie started
because I was

00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:13.760
trying to find a
way to give back

00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:16.700
after the election and support
causes that I believed in.

00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:19.850
And supporting women in
STEM is one of the ones

00:28:19.850 --> 00:28:21.860
that I believe in a lot.

00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:26.570
So I started it as a
little digital project

00:28:26.570 --> 00:28:28.290
that I wanted to put online.

00:28:28.290 --> 00:28:29.570
I thought, you know what?

00:28:29.570 --> 00:28:33.890
There are so many women that
people don't know about.

00:28:33.890 --> 00:28:35.510
Never heard their names before.

00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:37.343
They've probably heard
of their discoveries,

00:28:37.343 --> 00:28:38.990
but never knew that
women made them.

00:28:38.990 --> 00:28:42.410
So why don't we create a
format that's colorful,

00:28:42.410 --> 00:28:45.980
that's visually appealing so
that people's attentions are

00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:47.870
grabbed, and then we
can roll the stories

00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:50.090
into this experience?

00:28:50.090 --> 00:28:52.880
I did not expect for
it to be picked up

00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:56.000
by "Fast Company" and a bunch
of other different media

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:00.830
networks, which is kind of how
it grew to a global phenomenon.

00:29:00.830 --> 00:29:04.350
And I've just been continuing
to work on it, adding scientists

00:29:04.350 --> 00:29:04.850
to it.

00:29:08.270 --> 00:29:13.160
And we try very hard to go
into different countries

00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:15.410
and work with
different institutions

00:29:15.410 --> 00:29:16.880
to figure out
what's a way that we

00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:19.914
can bring Beyond Curie there.

00:29:19.914 --> 00:29:22.070
[LAUGHS] Thanks so
much for coming.

00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:25.720
[APPLAUSE]
