00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.840
MALE SPEAKER: All right.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.360
Maker Group, where are you?

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.200
Maker?

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.440
Maker?

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:56.270
Bueller?

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:57.930
Bueller?

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:58.410
Nobody?

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.120
OK.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.810
Easy Ad, are you guys here?

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.190
You guys haven't submitted
your link.

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:07.110
Oh, you're not--

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.550
nevermind, because you
don't have one.

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:10.800
Keeping me on my toes.

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.975
We're missing the Maker
Group, I think.

00:02:18.975 --> 00:02:20.060
They're in the back corner.

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.170
Can you go make sure?

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.640
Social Change, are
you guys here?

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.500
Charge, excuse me.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.620
Do you guys have a--

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.465
You got G+?

00:02:31.465 --> 00:02:32.815
You guys have to submit
the link.

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.235
I don't think you guys
submitted it.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.886
MALE SPEAKER: Is there a way
to change this to an easy

00:02:59.886 --> 00:03:00.715
shortened link?

00:03:00.715 --> 00:03:02.223
Or [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:02.223 --> 00:03:05.121
MALE SPEAKER: I'd just cut
and paste this URL.

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:12.350
I'll help you with that.

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:13.600
Do you have the link?

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:21.080
Should we get started?

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.190
Can you help these
guys get set up?

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.760
All right.

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.370
If you can hear me, clap once.

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.395
If you can hear me,
clap twice.

00:03:32.395 --> 00:03:35.410
If you can hear me,
clap three times.

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:36.170
All right.

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.660
I'm loud.

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.060
So this works well.

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.260
Thanks guys for coming.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:41.160
This was a lot of fun.

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.050
This is the most important
part, I feel like.

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:46.630
In a second, the judges are
going to introduce themselves.

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:47.780
Do you guys have a mic yet?

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.680
Yes.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.530
So keep in mind, this is where
the value is for this night--

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.220
hearing their feedback,
critiquing your pitches.

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.040
You guys already met everyone,
so that's a good takeaway.

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:00.960
We only have one mic.

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.530
We should have more
than one mic.

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.000
Because that would
be awesomer.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.600
You guys do like to talk, huh?

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:08.850
I'm on it.

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:13.660
Does that work?

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.920
So why don't you guys go ahead
and introduce yourselves?

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:26.070
CHRIS MESSINA: Hello.

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.970
My name is Chris Messina.

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:33.450
I am a designer on the Google+
UX platform team.

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:35.835
I started out at Google in
developer relations.

00:04:35.835 --> 00:04:37.660
So I worked on our platform
stuff, and now I'm doing

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:38.340
design stuff.

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.130
So I vaguely, in the most
abstract way helped out with

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:43.810
some of the new Google+
design stuff.

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.710
So hopefully you guys have
checked that out.

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.230
And before Google, I was sort
of on my own doing my own

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:50.090
consulting stuff.

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.230
And now I'm fully employed.

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.900
DON DODGE: Come on, Chris.

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.540
You're being too modest.

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:58.980
Chris Messina is the inventor
of the hashtag.

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:00.650
This is true.

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:05.550
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:07.810
CHRIS DIBONA: I prefer to call
that the IRC channel.

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:12.890
But we'll talk later.

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:14.650
STACY BROWN-PHILPOT: Hi,
Stacy Brown-Philpot.

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:18.380
I am the COO at TaskRabbit, a
little startup that helps

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.010
people get things done.

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:23.420
And I spent a number of years
at Google before TaskRabbit,

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:25.870
most recently as an EIR
at Google Ventures.

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:28.830
STEPHANIE PALMERI: Hi.

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:30.290
I'm Stephanie Palmeri.

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:32.160
I'm a principal at
SoftTech VC.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.490
We're a micro VC fund.

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:36.540
We actually co-invest with
Google Ventures quite a bit.

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:39.240
And we invest in B
to B and B to C

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:40.490
internet and mobile companies.

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:46.790
DON DODGE: I'm Don Dodge.

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:50.222
I work in Google Developer
Relations.

00:05:50.222 --> 00:05:52.500
Yeah, Google.

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:55.960
I also work with Google Ventures
in my spare time.

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.010
Before that, I was at Microsoft
for many years.

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:01.930
And before that, I did
five startups.

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:04.180
Some of them you'll
probably know--

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:08.870
Napster, the music company, Alta
Vista, the search engine,

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:13.790
Groove Networks with Ray Ozzie,
and a couple others

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:17.710
that you probably don't
know about.

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:18.960
CHRIS DIBONA: Thank you, Don.

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:24.900
Four claps for Don.

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:26.050
So my name's Chris DiBona.

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:30.390
I look after open source
for Google.

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:32.650
And what you probably don't
know about me is I failed

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:35.660
multiple times in startups.

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:40.090
Succeeded twice, failed three
times, different times.

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:44.080
And yeah, I started Developer
Relations at Google back in

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:47.250
2005 when we launched
co.google.com

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:48.970
back in the old days.

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:51.830
I'm a limited partner at
Icon Venture Partners.

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:53.215
I'm also a Google Ventures
associate.

00:06:53.215 --> 00:06:55.590
And I still work for Google,
running Open Source.

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:01.730
MALE SPEAKER: All right.

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:03.550
So just a quick recap.

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:06.220
You guys have two minutes
to present.

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:12.030
Ahmed over here is going
to be our lovely timer.

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:15.480
And then three minutes of
questions slash comments,

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:17.200
whatever these guys
want to say.

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:18.900
But we're going to try something
a little different.

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:21.460
And we're going to kind of take
it the big Omaha way,

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:24.400
where before everyone presents,
I want everyone to

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:27.450
get up, shout, clap, get really
loud, get them excited.

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:29.560
And that way, the pitches
will be a little better.

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:31.670
Get some energy flowing,
things like that.

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:32.460
So we're going to
give it a try.

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:33.800
I want everyone to stand
up right now.

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:35.050
Clap, shout.

00:07:39.292 --> 00:07:43.276
The louder the better.

00:07:43.276 --> 00:07:43.774
All right.

00:07:43.774 --> 00:07:45.090
You can sit down now.

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:46.140
We'll call that a trial.

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:47.040
That was good.

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:47.710
All right.

00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:51.140
So the order, because I know you
guys all have great eyes

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:52.890
and can see this.

00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:54.890
We're going to go, I'm going
to read them off.

00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:56.370
And then I'll let you
know who's going on.

00:07:56.370 --> 00:07:57.595
But first, [? Scodio's ?]
going to be on.

00:07:57.595 --> 00:07:59.620
They're in the gaming
vertical.

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:01.250
Smart Product Founder
is second.

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:02.370
That's health.

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:05.130
SATs with Friends,
that's education.

00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:10.740
Take Time is the location
based gigantic group.

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:13.190
Apricot is fashion.

00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:14.900
Cue Rates, enterprise.

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:17.050
Arc, media entertainment.

00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:18.940
Glass MD is Google Glass.

00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:20.180
Social Change is Maker.

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:21.870
That'll throw you off.

00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:24.210
Sorry, Social Charger.

00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:24.870
You're new.

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:26.750
I'm still learning your name.

00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:28.400
Then Easy Ad for design.

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:31.210
So all your tabs are
listed up here.

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:32.710
You guys have nothing
to set up.

00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:33.970
Just come over here,
switch tab.

00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:35.470
If you want someone to Drive
while you're doing that.

00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:36.909
That's good.

00:08:36.909 --> 00:08:38.510
So you guys ready?

00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:39.230
All right.

00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:43.231
Let's give a big, warm welcome
to [? Scodio. ?]

00:08:43.231 --> 00:08:44.481
Stand up!

00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:59.890
MALE SPEAKER: You guys really
make the shirts?

00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:01.300
MALE SPEAKER: Can we do
that one more time?

00:09:06.145 --> 00:09:07.670
All right, all right.

00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:09.960
So let's get started here.

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:11.940
Guys, we've been cheated.

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:13.370
I have really bad
news for you.

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:17.700
If you guys have played mobile
games in the past, really bad

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:21.340
news is the chances of
you playing a cheater

00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:22.900
are really damn high.

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:25.980
Actually, around one in four.

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:28.350
This is not only a problem
for the user base.

00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:30.950
But it's also a problem
for game developers.

00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:33.830
Now, in real estate,
there's a saying.

00:09:33.830 --> 00:09:36.115
And that is location,
location, location.

00:09:36.115 --> 00:09:38.020
Well, in the gaming industry,
we have a saying.

00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:40.810
That is retention, retention,
retention.

00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:44.550
The problem that cheats are
bringing in to the table is

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:48.030
they're affecting a game's
ability to keep their

00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:49.970
retention rates up.

00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:54.230
And what happens next
is people will just

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:55.710
stop playing the games.

00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:59.190
And then that affects a game's
ability to generate revenue.

00:09:59.190 --> 00:09:59.810
Well, guess what?

00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:05.250
We have a solution right now
to block cheats from ever

00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:07.850
affecting a game's ability
to generate revenue.

00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:08.960
Let me give you an example.

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:11.550
I'll just throw some
numbers out there.

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:13.850
You guys have, most of you
have played "Words with

00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:14.850
Friends," right?

00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:18.480
There are about 150 cheats
out there in the market.

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:21.840
You can just quickly go
in and type in "Words

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:22.490
with Friends" cheat.

00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:24.380
And you can download the
cheats right now.

00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:27.870
And in fact, the most popular
cheat for this game has about

00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:30.710
between five and 10
million downloads.

00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:31.810
That's just insane.

00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:34.350
That means that every time you
play the game, one in four

00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:37.140
times, you'll most likely be
playing against a cheater.

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:39.620
I don't know about you guys,
but that really sucks.

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:42.330
And it takes the fun
out of the game.

00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:44.910
And it takes money out of
a developer's pocket.

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:48.330
So what we want to do again
is just bring a

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:49.760
solution to this problem.

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:51.060
It's a new, emerging problem.

00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:53.670
But nonetheless,
it's a problem.

00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:57.180
We like to think ourselves
as the next OpenFeint.

00:10:57.180 --> 00:10:59.810
And we also like to think
ourselves as the next $10

00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:01.020
million slam dunk.

00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:02.270
Thank you.

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:10.720
Questions anyone?

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:12.040
Our panel?

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:13.970
CHRIS DIBONA: So as a
person who cheats--

00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:16.820
MALE SPEAKER: Oh, don't
tell me that.

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:19.940
CHRIS DIBONA: So when you use a
trainer on a PC, and it sits

00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:22.820
there and it watches the memory
space of the game, how

00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:23.740
are you going to avoid that?

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:25.890
How are you going to fight
that kind of problem?

00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:28.010
MALE SPEAKER: So there's
different ways

00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:30.120
you can manage this.

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:33.290
Luckily for us, the mobile
space is quite

00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:34.600
different from desktops.

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:40.880
And we have the ability
to be in a more--

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:45.090
in a sandbox ecosystem.

00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:48.090
What that means is we have the
ability to detect cheats based

00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:50.850
on a unique identifier, in
this case, for Android, a

00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:51.890
package name.

00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:55.620
And then we're able to have
a large definition list of

00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:56.670
package names.

00:11:56.670 --> 00:12:00.810
And that way, we know that we
for sure can detect that cheat

00:12:00.810 --> 00:12:02.310
whenever it's installed.

00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:04.030
And therefore, block it.

00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:08.530
And let the developer know that
hey, this guy's cheating.

00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:09.500
DON DODGE: So this
is a problem.

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:12.760
But who's going to pay you
money to solve it?

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:16.810
MALE SPEAKER: So what we're
trying to do is, we have SDKs

00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:19.380
available for developers
to integrate with.

00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:22.680
So it's as easy as three
lines of code.

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:26.630
And as soon as the developers
integrate with our service,

00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:28.570
they can access all
the benefits of

00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:29.520
anti-cheat for mobile.

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:32.390
Meaning they'll have the ability
to scan a user's

00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:36.050
device against hundreds if
not thousands of cheats.

00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:39.480
And that way, we'll be able to
provide the protection for

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:40.640
their games.

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:43.200
DON DODGE: So what does it do
when it discovers a cheat?

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:44.250
MALE SPEAKER: That's
a great question.

00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:46.080
We don't want to do anything.

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:48.790
We basically want to let the
developer know through a

00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:50.270
callback mechanism.

00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:52.550
And then it's the developer's
choice to do

00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:53.460
whatever they want.

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:56.030
They can nag them with a dialog
box, or they can just

00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:57.070
simply say, you know what?

00:12:57.070 --> 00:12:58.280
We're not going to let
you play until you

00:12:58.280 --> 00:12:59.530
uninstall these cheats.

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:08.795
56 kilobytes, the JAR file.

00:13:08.795 --> 00:13:10.045
It's extremely small.

00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:15.320
I'm sorry?

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:17.180
We're basically targeting
apps.

00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:20.400
Meaning, cheats that are
installed on a user's device.

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:21.220
I'll tell you what.

00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:23.750
A browser is not going to do
what some of these cheats do,

00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:27.015
which are extremely complex
and advanced.

00:13:27.015 --> 00:13:29.910
Some of these cheats will
actually take a screenshot of

00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:31.880
your ongoing game.

00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:35.500
Use OCR, original character
recognition, to detect the

00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:36.800
letters that are on the board.

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:40.480
And then provide to you every
single answer for that game

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:41.210
that you're playing.

00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:42.440
It's insane.

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:44.570
And you're not going to get
that through a browser.

00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:46.980
You need to have a native
application running, a native

00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:49.120
cheat running in the
mobile device.

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:50.950
And that's what we're
blocking.

00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:52.760
CHRIS MESSINA: So I got
a question for you.

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:53.830
Why didn't you go
the other way?

00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:56.190
Like, why don't you provide
like an equalizer?

00:13:56.190 --> 00:13:58.060
So if I'm playing against
someone who's cheating, I can

00:13:58.060 --> 00:13:58.740
cheat, too.

00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:01.770
You know what I mean?

00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:03.720
MALE SPEAKER: That's a solution
to a problem.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.780
STACY BROWN-PHILPOT:
I don't play games.

00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:10.320
So I'm struggling.

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:11.760
MALE SPEAKER: You got
to try "Words with

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:13.220
Friends." It's so fun.

00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:14.800
It's so fun.

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:16.660
STACY BROWN-PHILPOT: But I've
always been taught that

00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:17.900
cheaters never win.

00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:18.990
But in this case, they do.

00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:20.330
MALE SPEAKER: They
do, and it sucks.

00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:22.050
Because what happens is--

00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:23.410
STACY BROWN-PHILPOT: How
do you market this?

00:14:23.410 --> 00:14:25.220
You're not going to
make a decision.

00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:27.800
So you're going to have the
developers make a decision.

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:30.320
So you can't market that the
cheaters will never win.

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:33.320
So what's the compelling
value proposition?

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:34.450
MALE SPEAKER: Well, you know
that cheats are bad for the

00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:35.570
game, right?

00:14:35.570 --> 00:14:36.710
We know that for a fact.

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:38.840
STACY BROWN-PHILPOT: Why are
they bad for the game?

00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:40.620
MALE SPEAKER: Well,
a couple things.

00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:43.760
What I mentioned, so it affects
the game's ability to

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:46.850
keep their user base,
the retention rate.

00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:47.630
STACY BROWN-PHILPOT: And one
in four people cheat?

00:14:47.630 --> 00:14:49.360
MALE SPEAKER: About.

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:52.650
And this is just, again, this
is just some numbers that

00:14:52.650 --> 00:14:56.350
we've gotten from the market,
just looking at the number of

00:14:56.350 --> 00:14:57.820
people that have downloaded
cheats.

00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:05.840
STACY BROWN-PHILPOT: So maybe
one or two of us here are

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:07.090
cheating right now.

00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:11.490
MALE SPEAKER: Here's another
quick point I want to make.

00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:14.810
CHRIS DIBONA: Do I have to
jailbreak my theoretical iOS

00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:17.000
phone to do that?

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.190
MALE SPEAKER: Well, you don't
need jailbreak to cheat.

00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:21.980
And that's also part of
the problem, right?

00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:23.450
CHRIS DIBONA: Need it
to detect cheating.

00:15:23.450 --> 00:15:24.670
MALE SPEAKER: No, you
don't need it.

00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:24.900
You don't need it.

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:26.380
Absolutely not.

00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:27.890
Just a quick note.

00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:31.450
Another thing that they can
greatly benefit developers is

00:15:31.450 --> 00:15:35.380
we also have the ability
to block ad blockers.

00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:38.660
And if you guys are not familiar
with this, a lot of--

00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:42.290
CHRIS DIBONA: Why would
anyone block an ad?

00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:43.980
MALE SPEAKER: We have to
go to the next team.

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:44.940
Thank you very much.

00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:46.190
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:54.221
MALE SPEAKER: Let's give a big
standing ovation to Smart

00:15:54.221 --> 00:15:55.471
Product Finder.

00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:04.000
GEORGE: Hi, everybody.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.160
My name is George Gabor.

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:08.280
And I'm here to talk about
Smart Product Finder.

00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:11.540
So you go into a supermarket,
thousands of

00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:12.770
products on the shelves.

00:16:12.770 --> 00:16:15.570
Maybe you are concerned about
food allergies, glycemic index

00:16:15.570 --> 00:16:16.390
if you have diabetes.

00:16:16.390 --> 00:16:17.540
Maybe you're concerned
about calories.

00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:19.070
But hey, do you have time
to check it all out?

00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:20.370
Do you have time to read
all the labels?

00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:21.150
Do you have time to look
at any of that?

00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:22.680
Or are you just going to go, the
heck with it, I'm going to

00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:23.230
get the product.

00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:24.100
And I'm going home.

00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:25.780
And maybe you're not getting
the best product that you

00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:27.610
would want for yourself.

00:16:27.610 --> 00:16:30.730
So that's a real problem.

00:16:30.730 --> 00:16:31.960
How many of us are overweight?

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:34.200
How many of us are getting
food or other kinds of

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:35.960
products in our life that really
aren't good for us.

00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:38.230
And we're not able to really
make the best decisions

00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:40.290
because we don't have the time
or the energy to go through

00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:41.720
all the data.

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:44.890
Well, Smart Product Finder
uses Google Glass to get

00:16:44.890 --> 00:16:46.100
around that problem
and solve it.

00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:48.300
You go to the supermarket,
you look at the shelves.

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:50.050
You've already told it what
you're concerned about.

00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:51.710
If you're a diabetic, you might
be concerned about a

00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:53.250
food with a high
glycemic index.

00:16:53.250 --> 00:16:54.900
Maybe you're concerned about
calorie content.

00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:56.410
Maybe you're concerned,
hey, is this GMO?

00:16:56.410 --> 00:16:59.760
What's the probability that this
food is GMO or non-GMO?

00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:03.490
Organic, trans fats,
you name it.

00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:06.579
So you're looking on the
supermarket shelves.

00:17:06.579 --> 00:17:08.790
And Glass is going to tell
you, a green light, a red

00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:12.180
light, a happy face, an index,
how good does this product

00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:13.060
meet your needs?

00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:14.720
Or is this no, stay
away from that.

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:18.730
Or, you like this product and
this product, maybe you're

00:17:18.730 --> 00:17:20.380
going to like that
one, or that one.

00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:23.140
And there's going to be ad
revenue from that, right?

00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:32.880
So also, it's going to tell you
like Amazon or other kinds

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:35.810
of services, ratings from
individuals and users.

00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:37.470
You can say hey, this product
really worked

00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:38.620
for me or it didn't.

00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:40.180
And it goes beyond just food.

00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:41.620
What if you're concerned
about a toy?

00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:43.810
You're looking at a toy on a
shelf and Google Glass says,

00:17:43.810 --> 00:17:43.980
wait a minute.

00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:44.980
You're concerned about lead.

00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:47.980
Your kid might take that lead in
that product and put it in

00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:49.270
their mouth.

00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:52.670
Or wait a minute, there's 500
people who said, this kid

00:17:52.670 --> 00:17:55.660
bought this toy, my kid bought
this toy, and they got better

00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:58.390
grades in school,
and so forth.

00:17:58.390 --> 00:18:02.570
So this does potentially--

00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:03.480
I think it's a killer app.

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:06.050
Because what it does
potentially, just as Netflix

00:18:06.050 --> 00:18:13.390
changed the quality of what
people used for the quality of

00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:15.660
what they have in their life
of what they watch, this

00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:18.890
changes the quality of what
you have and what you buy,

00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:20.450
what you take into your life.

00:18:20.450 --> 00:18:22.180
And it does it so easily
just by Glass

00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:23.730
giving you that feedback.

00:18:23.730 --> 00:18:24.980
We out of time?

00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:36.050
CHRIS DIBONA: So I'm a
large boned person.

00:18:36.050 --> 00:18:37.470
Maybe I like living in denial.

00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:40.510
Why would I go and spend
whatever Glass ends up costing

00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:43.220
for the consumer, and then an
app I guess that I would buy

00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:44.470
on Glass to do this?

00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:48.920
GEORGE: You're going
to save time.

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:51.240
You're going to save a lot of
time based on what you want

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:52.440
out of life.

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:55.490
And with this thing telling
you what you like in life,

00:18:55.490 --> 00:18:59.650
what matters to you when you're
looking at products,

00:18:59.650 --> 00:19:04.150
especially food, whatever
you're concerned about.

00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:08.380
Is it saving time in getting
what you want, getting that

00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:12.814
instant feedback worth
something to you?

00:19:12.814 --> 00:19:14.580
STEPHANIE PALMERI: How do you
think about keeping it less

00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:15.350
overwhelming?

00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:17.400
I'm walking down the aisle in
the grocery store, and there's

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:20.100
thousands of products that are
kind of jumping out at me now

00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:21.420
with Glass, right?

00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:23.710
So how do I walk through that?

00:19:23.710 --> 00:19:26.270
What would I say in order
to make that--

00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:29.010
GEORGE: Well, maybe
you're telling it,

00:19:29.010 --> 00:19:31.640
maybe you're just--

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:34.050
OK, good question.

00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:37.600
And maybe you tell it how much
data you really want.

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:40.750
Maybe it's not going to give
you anything until you hold

00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:43.230
the bar code up to it and it
scans and gets the entry from

00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:45.470
the databases, all the data
that's relevant to you.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.290
CHRIS MESSINA: So if I
make Doritos, how do

00:19:49.290 --> 00:19:50.540
I cheat this system?

00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:57.040
GEORGE: You're a manufacturer.

00:19:57.040 --> 00:19:58.530
We come to you for
certification.

00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:02.840
And you can say, I want to
certify with my paperwork that

00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:04.640
this is an organic product,
and it's non-GMO.

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:07.790
And I'm lying through my teeth
in the paperwork I fill out.

00:20:07.790 --> 00:20:09.310
So that's how you can cheat,
although you might

00:20:09.310 --> 00:20:10.370
get caught for it.

00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:12.650
People may catch you
on it eventually.

00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:13.570
STACY BROWN-PHILPOT: What
if you don't go

00:20:13.570 --> 00:20:15.010
to the grocery store?

00:20:15.010 --> 00:20:19.380
What if you buy everything
online?

00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:21.520
GEORGE: If you buy everything
online, this

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:23.552
product is not for you.

00:20:23.552 --> 00:20:26.350
STACY BROWN-PHILPOT: So I can
eat all the ice cream I want?

00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:26.830
GEORGE: Yeah.

00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:27.640
Although I mean, I don't know.

00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:31.280
Maybe there could be an online
app that attaches to your

00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:33.940
computer that is related to
it that doesn't use Glass.

00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:36.930
But maybe it runs in the
background and gives you that

00:20:36.930 --> 00:20:39.490
extra information that accesses
the database as well.

00:20:39.490 --> 00:20:42.100
So this could be an alternative
to the Glass.

00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:45.315
You don't really need Glass
if you're online, do you?

00:20:45.315 --> 00:20:45.910
DON DODGE: That's true.

00:20:45.910 --> 00:20:47.780
What does GMO mean?

00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:50.150
GEORGE: Genetically
modified organism.

00:20:50.150 --> 00:20:51.140
And see, that's the problem.

00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:54.750
Because right now, we don't
know, most people don't know.

00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:57.300
And that was what Prop 37 was
about in this state earlier,

00:20:57.300 --> 00:21:04.390
whether a product is GMO or
not, unless a manufacturer

00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:05.850
tells you and certifies
it's not.

00:21:05.850 --> 00:21:08.710
Or in the case of our app, what
it's going to do is it's

00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:10.100
going to look at the
ingredients, and it's going to

00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:11.050
give a probability.

00:21:11.050 --> 00:21:14.550
Like if you're getting as a
soda pop and it's got corn

00:21:14.550 --> 00:21:16.880
syrup in it, the probability,
if the manufacturer doesn't

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:19.990
tell you, it's going to be about
90% that the corn syrup

00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:21.710
in that soda pop is GMO.

00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:23.370
So it's going to tell you.

00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:26.850
And unless they certify the
product in the database that

00:21:26.850 --> 00:21:29.070
it's non-GMO, it's going
to warn you.

00:21:29.070 --> 00:21:30.680
CHRIS DIBONA: So how
do you get paid?

00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:33.180
And have you considered using a
temperature sensor to see if

00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:35.130
I'm in front of the
ice cream counter?

00:21:35.130 --> 00:21:36.880
GEORGE: That's a good idea.

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:38.870
I think there's some ad revenue
that's going to come

00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:43.190
in from, if you like Product X
or Y, check out Product Z. Or

00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:47.930
let's say that there's a GMO
Cheerios type product and you

00:21:47.930 --> 00:21:49.740
say, oh, I want that,
but it's GMO.

00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:51.610
And it's going to say, hey,
there's another product here

00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:52.790
that's non-GMO.

00:21:52.790 --> 00:21:54.810
And if there's three of them
available, there could be a

00:21:54.810 --> 00:21:56.600
revenue stream by which
one pops up

00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:57.510
as the first alternate.

00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:58.870
MALE SPEAKER: Thank
you so much.

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:11.062
MALE SPEAKER: OK guys, can you
guys please keep it down?

00:22:11.062 --> 00:22:12.312
[INAUDIBLE]

00:22:16.254 --> 00:22:18.150
All right, who's next?

00:22:18.150 --> 00:22:19.764
MALE SPEAKER: Let's give
a big, warm welcome

00:22:19.764 --> 00:22:21.676
to SATs with Friends.

00:22:28.368 --> 00:22:29.750
Hold on, hold on.

00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:30.410
I got to pause.

00:22:30.410 --> 00:22:33.570
Because I saw half of the
back room not jump up.

00:22:33.570 --> 00:22:34.960
So let's try that
one more time.

00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:35.930
I'm serious.

00:22:35.930 --> 00:22:36.380
Everyone get up.

00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:37.630
Let's get some energy.

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:45.480
FEMALE SPEAKER: Hi.

00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:48.180
So our idea is SATs
with Friends.

00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:48.890
The problem--

00:22:48.890 --> 00:22:51.700
studies have shown that
continuous exposure to

00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:55.010
multiple sources of information
at one time causes

00:22:55.010 --> 00:22:58.970
your brain to not have enough
time to store into short term

00:22:58.970 --> 00:23:00.730
memory into long term memory.

00:23:00.730 --> 00:23:04.070
And this is a problem that
children face today within a

00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:06.360
technology driven environment,
especially those that are

00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:11.240
studying for an intense
test like the SATs.

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:12.830
MALE SPEAKER: Currently, there
are 20 million high school

00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:14.310
students in the United States.

00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:16.860
Two million are test preppers.

00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:22.250
This is a $2.5 billion
a year industry.

00:23:22.250 --> 00:23:24.590
FEMALE SPEAKER: Our solution is
to create a fun mobile game

00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:27.420
where they can play against
their friends or matched

00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:29.540
opponent based on their
skill level.

00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:32.570
And the engaging and repetitive
nature of gaming

00:23:32.570 --> 00:23:33.860
would encourage competition and

00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:35.900
memorization of the material.

00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:38.350
And unlike a typical static
game, this game would be

00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:40.150
social and real time.

00:23:40.150 --> 00:23:43.960
And it would use advanced
matching algorithms.

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:49.570
So we're using Zynga's way of
keeping their users engaged by

00:23:49.570 --> 00:23:52.000
matching them with players
of similar ability.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.840
So that way the individuals
continue bettering their

00:23:55.840 --> 00:24:00.370
scores and beat out
their opponents.

00:24:00.370 --> 00:24:01.770
MALE SPEAKER: So what does
this game look like?

00:24:01.770 --> 00:24:04.800
There are two categories,
math and verbal.

00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:07.990
For the math section, you would
get three math problems

00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:10.220
commonly found on the SAT.

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:13.420
You work on the problems and
then compare your results with

00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:14.930
your opponent.

00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:19.320
For the verbal section, you
would match definitions with

00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:21.510
commonly found SAT words.

00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:24.860
And points would be earned
based off of speed and

00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:28.190
accuracy to ward off cheating.

00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:31.090
The platforms we're looking at
are Android, iPhone, and

00:24:31.090 --> 00:24:32.140
Google Hangout.

00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:36.680
And our pricing format would
be have a free app and then

00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:38.520
$3.99 for a pro version.

00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:42.300
And also expanding to other
tests like the GRE and MCAT,

00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:43.756
those types of tests.

00:24:43.756 --> 00:24:45.006
FEMALE SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:24:52.838 --> 00:24:54.500
STACY BROWN-PHILPOT: So
who's your customer?

00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:55.390
Is it the teacher?

00:24:55.390 --> 00:24:56.620
Is it the parents?

00:24:56.620 --> 00:24:57.846
Is it the students?

00:24:57.846 --> 00:25:00.000
FEMALE SPEAKER: It's definitely
the students.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.840
So the students are the ones
that are having to

00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:04.240
prepare for this test.

00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:04.730
Oh, sorry.

00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:06.000
It would definitely
be the students.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:07.740
Because these are the
kids that are

00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:08.780
preparing for this test.

00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:10.820
And usually, it's the parents
that are buying the test

00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:11.720
preparation.

00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:13.570
And so these kids are
on the app store.

00:25:13.570 --> 00:25:16.780
They're buying apps, downloading
things every day.

00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:20.360
So they would find this game and
be excited to play it and

00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:21.200
play their friends.

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:23.575
So it's definitely
for the kids.

00:25:23.575 --> 00:25:24.820
DON DODGE: Is it free
to download?

00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:26.550
How's that work?

00:25:26.550 --> 00:25:28.520
FEMALE SPEAKER: So it's
free to download for a

00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:29.840
very limited version.

00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:33.080
And you could pay more to get a
pro version to get more data

00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:36.730
sets or more in depth
training.

00:25:36.730 --> 00:25:41.330
So it'll go deeper if
you pay for that.

00:25:41.330 --> 00:25:45.490
CHRIS DIBONA: So while I only
got 200 on the SATs, it was my

00:25:45.490 --> 00:25:47.740
understanding there's three
sections now, isn't there?

00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:49.910
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah, there's
also a writing section.

00:25:49.910 --> 00:25:52.370
I think you would have to
probably figure out a way to

00:25:52.370 --> 00:25:53.510
get essay prompts in there.

00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:55.210
But I think that's further
down the line.

00:25:55.210 --> 00:25:57.480
I think for now, it's a very
simple app where you're just

00:25:57.480 --> 00:26:00.590
learning very quick memorization
skills on

00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:02.100
formulas and things like that.

00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:08.780
DON DODGE: Is it timed
for your response?

00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:09.790
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yes,
it is timed.

00:26:09.790 --> 00:26:11.305
DON DODGE: And you get more
points if you answer faster?

00:26:11.305 --> 00:26:11.630
FEMALE SPEAKER: Correct.

00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:12.140
Yep.

00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:12.580
DON DODGE: Great.

00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:14.130
FEMALE SPEAKER: It's based
on accuracy and timing.

00:26:14.130 --> 00:26:16.150
CHRIS MESSINA: I mean, did you
guys also consider stuff

00:26:16.150 --> 00:26:18.180
that's a little less like the
SAT in order to sort of

00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:20.730
motivate to people to one, sort
of think about this as

00:26:20.730 --> 00:26:24.150
being fun, and two, to get
people to come back to it

00:26:24.150 --> 00:26:24.790
organically?

00:26:24.790 --> 00:26:27.210
Maybe people who are not
studying for the SATs?

00:26:27.210 --> 00:26:27.930
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah,
definitely.

00:26:27.930 --> 00:26:32.250
I think this lends well to a
very vast, wide range of

00:26:32.250 --> 00:26:32.780
activities.

00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:34.970
So it doesn't have
to be test prep.

00:26:34.970 --> 00:26:37.670
But I think the goal of it is
to really encourage kids to

00:26:37.670 --> 00:26:39.970
have fun when they're studying,
and to be engaged

00:26:39.970 --> 00:26:42.806
when they're trying to
study and focus.

00:26:42.806 --> 00:26:44.335
CHRIS MESSINA: Would you
be licensing the brand?

00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:48.380
FEMALE SPEAKER: So I used
to work at Zynga.

00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:50.995
But I mean, potentially--

00:26:50.995 --> 00:26:52.270
CHRIS MESSINA: Full
disclosure.

00:26:52.270 --> 00:26:54.530
FEMALE SPEAKER: You could
definitely license this brand

00:26:54.530 --> 00:26:55.780
out, for sure.

00:27:03.983 --> 00:27:05.233
Thank you.

00:27:09.472 --> 00:27:09.971
MALE SPEAKER: All right.

00:27:09.971 --> 00:27:13.464
Take time to stand up and
cheer for Take Time.

00:27:38.574 --> 00:27:42.140
BRANDY LEE CAMACHO: Well,
we got a lot of support.

00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:42.780
Good evening.

00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:44.600
My name is Brandy Lee Camacho.

00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:47.980
Let me take this time to present
to you a team that is

00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:51.750
going to announce our new
application, Take Time.

00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:54.580
Currently, there are 1.3
million plumbers,

00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:57.380
electricians, and AC
professionals in the United

00:27:57.380 --> 00:27:58.850
States of America.

00:27:58.850 --> 00:28:00.706
Many of them still use
paper to track

00:28:00.706 --> 00:28:05.080
their time, work orders.

00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:09.630
Current market leader service
CEO uses closed system and

00:28:09.630 --> 00:28:12.820
does not integrate well
with a calendar.

00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:16.310
There is a problem, a real world
problem, in the service

00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:17.770
based industry.

00:28:17.770 --> 00:28:22.140
Generally, service techs are
more effective performing

00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:25.860
their daily job duties, not
performing paperwork.

00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:29.610
Issues that are often found are
inaccurate timekeeping,

00:28:29.610 --> 00:28:32.160
which results in a loss of
profits for small and medium

00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:34.110
sized businesses.

00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:37.750
Currently, service techs perform
a manual process that

00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:40.050
uses paper to fill out
their work orders.

00:28:40.050 --> 00:28:42.720
This results in errors.

00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:47.220
The end result is a major loss
of profits for the business.

00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:50.080
With current technologies,
there is a solution.

00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:52.740
There is no reason to do
this manually anymore.

00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:56.400
Take a moment to imagine your
service technician.

00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:59.070
You have an Android
tablet device.

00:28:59.070 --> 00:29:02.400
Your application will utilize
geofencing API to determine

00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:05.630
time of stay at the work site.

00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:08.400
Also, you will have the ability
to provide a voice

00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:11.330
dictation of the work that was
performed, and calculate a

00:29:11.330 --> 00:29:13.980
route between sites.

00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:16.070
Small and medium sized
businesses do not have the

00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:20.290
time or resources to tackle a
manual time management system.

00:29:20.290 --> 00:29:23.030
By leveraging Google
technologies, we are providing

00:29:23.030 --> 00:29:25.920
an accurate and an effective
invoices system which will

00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:28.600
boost the overall profits
for small businesses.

00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:30.400
Thank you very much.

00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:31.650
Take Time.

00:29:35.850 --> 00:29:37.600
STEPHANIE PALMERI: How do you
guys think about distribution

00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:41.210
to the service professionals?

00:29:41.210 --> 00:29:44.640
How do you actually get the
tablet [? enhancements ?] to

00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:45.130
professionals?

00:29:45.130 --> 00:29:46.300
And how do you actually get--

00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:48.110
I mean, there are thousands
and thousands of service

00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:48.650
professionals.

00:29:48.650 --> 00:29:51.690
So you're not going to large
corporations and going top

00:29:51.690 --> 00:29:54.090
down, so you're kind of going
to individual reps.

00:29:54.090 --> 00:29:55.570
So how do you spread the word?

00:29:55.570 --> 00:29:57.500
How do you market this thing?

00:29:57.500 --> 00:29:59.180
MALE SPEAKER: Thanks to Google,
we have to market this

00:29:59.180 --> 00:30:01.640
in the Google Apps for
Businesses, so we can

00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:03.330
leverage this up.

00:30:03.330 --> 00:30:05.250
That's of course one way.

00:30:05.250 --> 00:30:08.460
The other way around would be
using AdWords to promote to an

00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:10.870
online customer, which
is the first target.

00:30:10.870 --> 00:30:13.695
Obviously, not all small
business will use our app

00:30:13.695 --> 00:30:16.250
first day, but that's a start.

00:30:16.250 --> 00:30:18.580
MALE SPEAKER: A lot of times,
for small businesses, they get

00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:20.060
a lot of tips from
their friends.

00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:22.020
And so word of mouth really
helps if you've got a great

00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:23.930
application.

00:30:23.930 --> 00:30:25.360
BRANDY LEE CAMACHO: Let's not
forget that these service

00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:27.570
technicians right now already
have a smartphone.

00:30:27.570 --> 00:30:30.120
I would have to say 90% of the
professionals out there that

00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:33.110
are doing day to day services
are managing their business

00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:34.600
solely off their smartphone.

00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:37.250
Now, when they start using our
application, I'm willing to

00:30:37.250 --> 00:30:39.190
bet they're going to migrate to
a tablet so they could be

00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:40.440
more efficient on the site.

00:30:43.910 --> 00:30:46.060
CHRIS DIBONA: So you don't know
this, but I'm a plumber.

00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:48.720
And I have four trucks
running around Tampa,

00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:49.720
Florida right now.

00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:54.030
So the flexibility that paper
gives my guys is really pretty

00:30:54.030 --> 00:30:54.690
significant.

00:30:54.690 --> 00:30:56.170
I have bigger problems
like inventory

00:30:56.170 --> 00:30:57.350
management and all the rest.

00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:59.040
So what do you actually
selling?

00:30:59.040 --> 00:30:59.670
Is this an app?

00:30:59.670 --> 00:31:02.070
Are you selling a whole thing
that ties into my current

00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:03.980
service software?

00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:07.190
I mean, what are you
selling exactly?

00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:08.940
BRANDY LEE CAMACHO: Well at
first, I would imagine that

00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:12.280
this application would
be aimed towards the

00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:13.690
individual at first.

00:31:13.690 --> 00:31:15.770
So we could promote it and
get the word out there.

00:31:15.770 --> 00:31:19.050
So this application will run
solely as a client application

00:31:19.050 --> 00:31:20.600
on a device.

00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:23.890
Then, we'll go ahead and start
introducing new service that's

00:31:23.890 --> 00:31:25.610
going to be aimed towards
small businesses,

00:31:25.610 --> 00:31:27.730
[? by request ?] individuals,
which is going to go ahead and

00:31:27.730 --> 00:31:29.960
utilize App Engine
as the back end.

00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:32.430
Store data, form reports.

00:31:32.430 --> 00:31:36.220
Not to mention that when you sit
there and store your data,

00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:38.480
as a small business owner,
you're going to be able to do

00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:41.330
reporting, export that data,
import it directly into your

00:31:41.330 --> 00:31:44.250
accounting system, such as
FreshBooks, QuickBooks.

00:31:44.250 --> 00:31:46.050
And go ahead and have those
invoices automatically

00:31:46.050 --> 00:31:47.510
developed for you.

00:31:47.510 --> 00:31:48.480
Now, it does save time.

00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:51.470
I understand that you're using
paper on your sites.

00:31:51.470 --> 00:31:53.930
But let's not forget, your
service technicians are doing

00:31:53.930 --> 00:31:55.230
this job manually.

00:31:55.230 --> 00:31:57.090
Most likely, you're going
to be doing errors.

00:31:57.090 --> 00:32:00.160
Maybe they want from Site A to
Site B and forgot about what

00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:02.020
they did last 15 minutes.

00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:05.210
You take 15 minutes with one
employee, you're billing out

00:32:05.210 --> 00:32:06.090
$100 an hour.

00:32:06.090 --> 00:32:08.120
That's $25 that you just lost.

00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:11.070
Take that over the course of
week, you've got $125.

00:32:11.070 --> 00:32:14.990
Over a month, it just adds
up, $500 per employee.

00:32:14.990 --> 00:32:17.540
This program's going to
literally save your business

00:32:17.540 --> 00:32:19.110
money and gain profits.

00:32:22.790 --> 00:32:24.680
STACY BROWN-PHILPOT: How do you
deal with customization?

00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:27.170
You broadly talked about
service providers.

00:32:27.170 --> 00:32:28.730
And at TaskRabbit,
we work with a

00:32:28.730 --> 00:32:30.490
lot of service providers.

00:32:30.490 --> 00:32:34.570
And the skilled workers
are different.

00:32:34.570 --> 00:32:36.460
People who clean houses, people
who are plumbers,

00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:38.510
electricians, they
want customized.

00:32:38.510 --> 00:32:39.700
And that gets expensive.

00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:41.520
So how do you build a
scalable product?

00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:43.790
BRANDY LEE CAMACHO: Well,
Google+ handles a lot

00:32:43.790 --> 00:32:44.550
of stuff for us.

00:32:44.550 --> 00:32:48.420
We're going to integrate Google+
within our product.

00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:49.670
[INAUDIBLE]

00:32:52.135 --> 00:32:54.925
Thank you.

00:32:54.925 --> 00:32:57.617
MALE SPEAKER: Let's give a
sweet intro to Apricot.

00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:15.770
CHRIS DIBONA: Is that Apricot
with two p's?

00:33:15.770 --> 00:33:17.020
I'm just checking.

00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:22.420
Because we have a little Bingo
card going, and misspelling

00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:25.770
things intentionally is one
of the Bingo things.

00:33:25.770 --> 00:33:27.020
[INAUDIBLE].

00:33:30.089 --> 00:33:33.720
Are you the fashion people?

00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:35.750
Do you really think that
Christopher Moore is fashion?

00:33:38.430 --> 00:33:41.650
No, go on, sorry.

00:33:41.650 --> 00:33:44.160
I've really been more partial
to Alexander McQueen.

00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:48.435
So just the latest shoe line
is fantastic, the three

00:33:48.435 --> 00:33:49.100
buckled boot?

00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:50.350
It's impossible to get.

00:33:50.350 --> 00:33:51.110
But go ahead.

00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:52.410
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:33:52.410 --> 00:33:57.780
All right, so we're
Team Apricot.

00:33:57.780 --> 00:34:00.560
And our product is
vote your runway.

00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:01.960
So here's the problem.

00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:04.560
So if you're a student,
finishing fashion school.

00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:05.680
You're trying to launch
your line.

00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:06.570
But you have no money.

00:34:06.570 --> 00:34:07.990
You're trying to get exposure.

00:34:07.990 --> 00:34:09.870
You're trying to get people
to buy your product.

00:34:09.870 --> 00:34:13.020
But there's no way to really
connect with new consumers, or

00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:15.610
actually get money to
launch a product.

00:34:15.610 --> 00:34:17.340
So here's our solution.

00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:20.989
In a nutshell, it's like Project
Runway but online.

00:34:20.989 --> 00:34:24.810
So what we're proposing to do
is have a monthly contest

00:34:24.810 --> 00:34:28.830
where designers can upload
a project of the month.

00:34:28.830 --> 00:34:31.199
And people can vote
on the project and

00:34:31.199 --> 00:34:32.330
select their best product.

00:34:32.330 --> 00:34:35.219
And the winner wins seed money
for their first fashion line.

00:34:35.219 --> 00:34:37.790
So let's say for example,
this month is sweaters.

00:34:37.790 --> 00:34:40.670
So each designer makes
their first sweater.

00:34:40.670 --> 00:34:41.630
People can design it.

00:34:41.630 --> 00:34:45.409
And then that winner will win
money for their fashion line.

00:34:45.409 --> 00:34:48.440
So in the back end, how this
works is they're going to use

00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:51.409
Google Apps Engine to run the
back end of the solution, and

00:34:51.409 --> 00:34:52.739
to run analytics.

00:34:52.739 --> 00:34:56.120
And additionally, people vote on
their products they want by

00:34:56.120 --> 00:34:57.050
using pictures.

00:34:57.050 --> 00:34:59.000
But if they want additional
interaction with the designer

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.700
or the process, we'll also
integrate YouTube for

00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:03.760
inter-engagement
on that aspect.

00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:06.320
So how do we make
money with this?

00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:07.960
Number one is with
advertising.

00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:10.190
So we plan on advertising with
key products in the fashion

00:35:10.190 --> 00:35:12.400
industry as a way to
generate revenue.

00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:15.070
Number two, it's actually more
of a crowdsourcing model.

00:35:15.070 --> 00:35:18.050
So the top winner, in addition
to winning seed money from us,

00:35:18.050 --> 00:35:20.470
is actually going to win money
from the crowdsourcing people

00:35:20.470 --> 00:35:21.420
who vote them up.

00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:25.140
And our take is about 2% to 3%
out of that in order to bring

00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:26.540
revenue to our company.

00:35:26.540 --> 00:35:27.570
And that's it.

00:35:27.570 --> 00:35:28.820
Thank you.

00:35:32.570 --> 00:35:34.140
STEPHANIE PALMERI: So
I look at a lot of

00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:35.720
companies in this space.

00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:38.120
A lot.

00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:40.850
Can you give me a little bit
more of an idea about where

00:35:40.850 --> 00:35:42.280
the funding is coming from?

00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:45.630
I assume you're crowdsourcing
the voting.

00:35:45.630 --> 00:35:49.984
But are people also pre-paying
for the orders?

00:35:49.984 --> 00:35:52.190
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yes, they're
pre-paying for the orders.

00:35:52.190 --> 00:35:53.820
And it's basically 50%.

00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:56.420
So that's the incentive
for the customers to

00:35:56.420 --> 00:35:57.740
order online early.

00:35:57.740 --> 00:35:58.050
STEPHANIE PALMERI: OK.

00:35:58.050 --> 00:36:00.920
And so then that prepay for the
order gets you enough to

00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:03.040
do, like, volume
of order-wise?

00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:05.946
Or are you selling after
the fact, as well?

00:36:05.946 --> 00:36:06.330
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:36:06.330 --> 00:36:11.850
Because it gives the designer an
incentive to say, should I

00:36:11.850 --> 00:36:14.690
actually produce this from
a massive perspective?

00:36:14.690 --> 00:36:16.270
Because you don't want to
produce something and no one's

00:36:16.270 --> 00:36:16.900
going to buy it.

00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:18.470
So it's a very good
indicator of what

00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:21.220
consumers actually want.

00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:22.640
STEPHANIE PALMERI: So one piece
of feedback on this,

00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:26.480
just because I look at tons of
companies in this space, you

00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:28.840
might want to think about the
fact that typically, these

00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:31.110
designers actually create
a whole lineup.

00:36:31.110 --> 00:36:33.130
And it's not just one
particular piece.

00:36:33.130 --> 00:36:36.120
And it becomes very difficult to
sell one individual piece.

00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:38.560
So thinking about how you can
actually fund a whole line is

00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:41.020
something that I would just
use as food for thought.

00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:42.400
MALE SPEAKER: And the
seed money is to

00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:43.550
fund their first line.

00:36:43.550 --> 00:36:46.310
It's the monthly competition
of that one item.

00:36:46.310 --> 00:36:48.620
So customers can come
to the site, I'm

00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:49.320
looking for a sweater.

00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:51.410
And find the best sweater
out of all designers.

00:36:51.410 --> 00:36:52.940
And then that money will
seed the designs, if

00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:53.928
you like that designer.

00:36:53.928 --> 00:36:55.680
STEPHANIE PALMERI: Got it.

00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:56.750
STACY BROWN-PHILPOT: How do
you deal with delayed

00:36:56.750 --> 00:36:58.386
gratification?

00:36:58.386 --> 00:36:59.636
I want my sweater now.

00:37:02.556 --> 00:37:04.220
STEPHANIE PALMERI: Yeah, on
Amazon Prime I can get it

00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:05.470
like, tomorrow.

00:37:09.650 --> 00:37:11.790
MALE SPEAKER: I can
take that one.

00:37:11.790 --> 00:37:15.090
I think for sweaters that are
readily available on the

00:37:15.090 --> 00:37:18.210
market, you do have a
legitimate question.

00:37:18.210 --> 00:37:22.320
But right now, what we're
offering is this unique item

00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:25.020
that nobody has, come up from
these fresh designers that

00:37:25.020 --> 00:37:25.960
nobody knows about.

00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:28.310
So it's worth the wait.

00:37:28.310 --> 00:37:31.080
CHRIS MESSINA: So I have backed
probably five or six

00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:32.930
fashion projects
on Kickstarter.

00:37:32.930 --> 00:37:35.140
I won clothes for life
on one of them.

00:37:35.140 --> 00:37:38.220
I don't know how that happens
but, you know.

00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:42.940
I have probably gotten one
pair of boxers so far.

00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:45.360
So I'm not wearing them
now, to be clear.

00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:50.030
I am wearing some underwear,
but anyways.

00:37:50.030 --> 00:37:50.920
CHRIS DIBONA: Do you anticipate
[INAUDIBLE]

00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:52.090
like sandpaper?

00:37:52.090 --> 00:37:53.130
CHRIS MESSINA: I mean,
I'm just saying.

00:37:53.130 --> 00:37:55.670
Like, if I hadn't gotten that
pair of boxers, I may--

00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:57.810
anyways, I'm not going
to go there anymore.

00:37:57.810 --> 00:38:01.080
But I think this problem of
delayed gratification and

00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:03.370
waiting months and months to get
fulfilment I think is an

00:38:03.370 --> 00:38:04.520
interesting problem,
unless you have

00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:05.560
some alternative process.

00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:06.750
CHRIS DIBONA: You could
run out of underpants.

00:38:06.750 --> 00:38:08.080
CHRIS MESSINA: That's
my point, right?

00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:10.640
I mean, maybe there
needs to be a--

00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:12.440
CHRIS DIBONA: You must
plan for underpants.

00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:14.840
Sorry.

00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:16.250
CHRIS MESSINA: That's the
crux of my question.

00:38:19.060 --> 00:38:20.660
MALE SPEAKER: So there's
two things.

00:38:20.660 --> 00:38:24.190
So we talked about A, how do
we guarantee that A, the

00:38:24.190 --> 00:38:26.125
designers are actually going to
fulfill the promise, and do

00:38:26.125 --> 00:38:27.060
what they're going to do?

00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:28.240
So we actually had a
staged approach.

00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:30.140
In which, yeah, you
won $10,000.

00:38:30.140 --> 00:38:32.000
But you actually get
it in increments.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.010
So our idea is if you win,
you have to upload

00:38:34.010 --> 00:38:34.810
pictures and videos.

00:38:34.810 --> 00:38:36.470
So like most successful
Kickstarters,

00:38:36.470 --> 00:38:37.340
they give you progress.

00:38:37.340 --> 00:38:38.070
And so you're sort of--

00:38:38.070 --> 00:38:39.340
CHRIS MESSINA: So what you're
saying is like, I'm not

00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:40.680
necessarily buying
the clothes.

00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:41.840
I'm buying the process.

00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:45.590
And then maybe, I'll get some
boxers or sweaters at the end.

00:38:45.590 --> 00:38:47.320
MALE SPEAKER: Well again, the
seed money is for their

00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:47.950
fashion line.

00:38:47.950 --> 00:38:50.330
So you get the product, plus
you're investing into their

00:38:50.330 --> 00:38:52.070
fashion line that they're
building.

00:38:52.070 --> 00:38:53.560
FEMALE SPEAKER: And no designer
wants his or her

00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:54.880
reputation ruined.

00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:55.570
That's your reputation.

00:38:55.570 --> 00:38:56.960
You're not just [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:57.900
CHRIS MESSINA: I would
have thought that on

00:38:57.900 --> 00:39:00.910
Kickstarter, too, but.

00:39:00.910 --> 00:39:03.510
DON DODGE: Seems like this would
be a good application

00:39:03.510 --> 00:39:07.680
for the big guys that are
putting out fashion.

00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:12.390
Because they are constantly
guessing who is going to buy

00:39:12.390 --> 00:39:15.070
this, and how much big
production runs to do.

00:39:15.070 --> 00:39:17.030
So these are established
designers

00:39:17.030 --> 00:39:19.580
and established retailers.

00:39:19.580 --> 00:39:22.340
They have no clue what the
demand is going to be.

00:39:22.340 --> 00:39:24.430
So maybe you could
apply it just to

00:39:24.430 --> 00:39:26.700
that rather than designers.

00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:27.840
But I don't know.

00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:29.666
What do you think?

00:39:29.666 --> 00:39:30.916
[INAUDIBLE]

00:39:36.896 --> 00:39:37.750
MALE SPEAKER: All right.

00:39:37.750 --> 00:39:39.010
Five star ovation for
[? Curate. ?]

00:40:31.490 --> 00:40:32.640
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:33.890
Imagine this.

00:40:38.490 --> 00:40:40.720
You go to a Starbucks.

00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:45.720
And the cashier there will
either be somewhat nice to

00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:48.960
you, or will give you somewhat
of an attitude.

00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:53.570
It's not worth it that you go
into the trouble of finding an

00:40:53.570 --> 00:40:58.160
email or entering their lengthy
feedback forms.

00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:08.690
But because the current state of
feedback looks like either

00:41:08.690 --> 00:41:12.930
this manual or you have to enter
a URL or a scanner QR

00:41:12.930 --> 00:41:16.420
code that will lead you to a
page that looks somewhat like

00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:22.190
this, a 20 question survey.

00:41:22.190 --> 00:41:24.590
But it doesn't have
to be this way.

00:41:24.590 --> 00:41:28.590
What we're suggesting is a
very quick way to gather

00:41:28.590 --> 00:41:33.120
customer feedback, either by
NFC or scanning QR codes,

00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:38.270
where it will take you directly
to a very simple form

00:41:38.270 --> 00:41:41.170
that looks like this, just a
smiley face and a slider.

00:41:41.170 --> 00:41:44.940
And you can show how satisfied
or how dissatisfied of the

00:41:44.940 --> 00:41:46.210
service you are.

00:41:46.210 --> 00:41:51.140
And the data goes directly
to our cloud platform.

00:41:51.140 --> 00:41:55.520
And we can give them near real
time or even real time

00:41:55.520 --> 00:41:58.490
feedback of how their
service is doing.

00:41:58.490 --> 00:42:03.840
For example, they can get five
unsatisfied customers and know

00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:05.530
there's something wrong
in the branch.

00:42:05.530 --> 00:42:08.550
And they can take an action
at the same time.

00:42:08.550 --> 00:42:13.100
So what we are suggesting is a
way to solve and have people

00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:14.880
actually give feedback.

00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:18.840
And do all sort of things with
the feedback that we're

00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:22.260
getting once we get it.

00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:24.430
That's our idea.

00:42:24.430 --> 00:42:25.860
Thank you for listening.

00:42:31.970 --> 00:42:33.220
Do you have any questions?

00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:39.630
CHRIS DIBONA: Have you
considered calling it Feedback

00:42:39.630 --> 00:42:40.880
with Friends?

00:42:44.110 --> 00:42:45.400
MALE SPEAKER: Friends
will always give

00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:46.630
you positive feedback.

00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:49.450
CHRIS DIBONA: They're
very unreliable.

00:42:49.450 --> 00:42:51.220
CHRIS MESSINA: So why would you
do this from the company

00:42:51.220 --> 00:42:55.770
side and not sort of on the
individual side, where

00:42:55.770 --> 00:42:58.550
individuals are able to have
an app, or to talk about, I

00:42:58.550 --> 00:43:00.740
mean, I am an avid user
of things like

00:43:00.740 --> 00:43:01.940
Foursquare, for example.

00:43:01.940 --> 00:43:05.410
And I make my opinions
known there.

00:43:05.410 --> 00:43:06.540
MALE SPEAKER: As opposed to--

00:43:06.540 --> 00:43:09.650
because the companies or
enterprises already invest a

00:43:09.650 --> 00:43:13.270
lot of money in ways that they
want to gather their own

00:43:13.270 --> 00:43:14.230
customers' feedback.

00:43:14.230 --> 00:43:16.390
And they spend all these
reward points.

00:43:16.390 --> 00:43:17.250
And it doesn't work.

00:43:17.250 --> 00:43:20.385
Because it's not
done properly.

00:43:20.385 --> 00:43:24.510
So what we're suggesting is
something that will actually

00:43:24.510 --> 00:43:25.436
work for them.

00:43:25.436 --> 00:43:27.940
CHRIS MESSINA: So you're saying
it doesn't work because

00:43:27.940 --> 00:43:28.936
it's too complex?

00:43:28.936 --> 00:43:31.160
MALE SPEAKER: Too complex,
yeah, the interface--

00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:33.340
CHRIS MESSINA: But I'm wondering
like, is a smiley

00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:35.230
face a sufficient way
of actually knowing

00:43:35.230 --> 00:43:36.680
what's going wrong?

00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:41.820
MALE SPEAKER: No, that's why
it's the only required thing.

00:43:41.820 --> 00:43:43.930
All the rest can be optional.

00:43:43.930 --> 00:43:45.580
CHRIS DIBONA: We're more worried
about frowny faces.

00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:53.300
FEMALE SPEAKER: The difference
that this product is private.

00:43:53.300 --> 00:43:56.620
When you complain
in Foursquare,

00:43:56.620 --> 00:43:58.250
everybody can see that.

00:43:58.250 --> 00:44:03.860
And this is only for the
companies that want to really

00:44:03.860 --> 00:44:05.740
have their feedback.

00:44:05.740 --> 00:44:08.645
But doesn't want to have
the complaints online.

00:44:08.645 --> 00:44:12.360
This is to take the complaints,
and then change

00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:13.050
the service.

00:44:13.050 --> 00:44:14.520
If you have an immediate--

00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:17.020
for example, in a hotel.

00:44:17.020 --> 00:44:18.850
When you are in a hotel,
you want to

00:44:18.850 --> 00:44:20.155
complain about the service.

00:44:20.155 --> 00:44:22.414
And you want to complain now.

00:44:22.414 --> 00:44:23.866
[INAUDIBLE]

00:44:23.866 --> 00:44:26.770
Yes, like that.

00:44:26.770 --> 00:44:30.490
If you don't have to wait to
have these complaints--

00:44:33.820 --> 00:44:35.900
you don't have to wait
to [? attain ?]

00:44:35.900 --> 00:44:40.590
these complaints until the
customer leaves your place,

00:44:40.590 --> 00:44:42.020
you can change [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:42.020 --> 00:44:42.940
right now.

00:44:42.940 --> 00:44:45.600
And if you have another kind
of [? retailing scene, ?]

00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:50.290
for example, a cafe, you
can see your customer.

00:44:50.290 --> 00:44:55.060
You can now immediately
taste the coffee.

00:44:55.060 --> 00:44:58.280
Say, yeah, OK, we need to
change the formula.

00:44:58.280 --> 00:45:00.700
DON DODGE: So businesses
actually do have a big

00:45:00.700 --> 00:45:03.050
problem with Yelp.

00:45:03.050 --> 00:45:09.280
They want something that the
customer can complain

00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:11.230
privately to them.

00:45:11.230 --> 00:45:15.370
So if there was an app where you
could complain privately

00:45:15.370 --> 00:45:21.250
and stop these negative things
on Yelp, then they

00:45:21.250 --> 00:45:22.830
actually like that.

00:45:22.830 --> 00:45:23.970
And they'd pay a lot
of money for that.

00:45:23.970 --> 00:45:24.540
MALE SPEAKER: Correct.

00:45:24.540 --> 00:45:28.780
Sometimes I want to report a
negative experience, not

00:45:28.780 --> 00:45:31.750
because I want to defame
the business.

00:45:31.750 --> 00:45:35.070
On the contrary, because I want
the owner of the business

00:45:35.070 --> 00:45:38.940
to know about the attitude of
his employee and improve it.

00:45:38.940 --> 00:45:41.240
And of course, customer
satisfaction

00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:42.950
is not solved properly.

00:45:42.950 --> 00:45:47.610
Because it needs to be
authentic, or it needs to be

00:45:47.610 --> 00:45:49.290
very accurate.

00:45:49.290 --> 00:45:51.700
DON DODGE: The other pain point
with Yelp is that the

00:45:51.700 --> 00:45:56.140
businesses can't respond in a
timely fashion, or sometimes

00:45:56.140 --> 00:45:58.230
even at all without extortion.

00:45:58.230 --> 00:46:00.590
MALE SPEAKER: And there
is no way to tell--

00:46:00.590 --> 00:46:02.604
MALE SPEAKER: All right,
thank you so much.

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:11.720
Let's give a jumping
ovation to Arke.

00:46:24.150 --> 00:46:24.490
MALE SPEAKER: All right.

00:46:24.490 --> 00:46:27.230
So while Tony sets up our
Google+, we did want to make a

00:46:27.230 --> 00:46:30.590
mention that we had a sixth
teammate tonight, Dustin.

00:46:30.590 --> 00:46:32.250
He unfortunately had to
catch a bus home.

00:46:32.250 --> 00:46:34.240
Just wanted to give him
credit as well.

00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:35.370
And then we're going to have
a little bit of audience

00:46:35.370 --> 00:46:36.230
interaction in the beginning.

00:46:36.230 --> 00:46:38.820
So we could ask for your support
and interact with us

00:46:38.820 --> 00:46:40.120
with some of our questions,
we'd love it.

00:46:40.120 --> 00:46:41.370
Thank you.

00:46:51.470 --> 00:46:55.310
So how many people out there
have any number, amount, of

00:46:55.310 --> 00:46:57.590
contacts in your books right
now that have more than one

00:46:57.590 --> 00:47:01.110
phone number or one email,
raise your hands.

00:47:01.110 --> 00:47:01.700
OK, great.

00:47:01.700 --> 00:47:04.060
And how many of you have run
into a situation where you get

00:47:04.060 --> 00:47:06.900
a mass email or you see a
Facebook group saying, oh, I

00:47:06.900 --> 00:47:10.260
lost my contacts, can
I have yours?

00:47:10.260 --> 00:47:10.660
OK, great.

00:47:10.660 --> 00:47:13.520
And keep your hands raised if
you didn't post your number

00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:16.530
because you didn't want
anyone else to see it.

00:47:16.530 --> 00:47:18.750
So this is the problem
today, is contact

00:47:18.750 --> 00:47:20.500
information is very static.

00:47:20.500 --> 00:47:23.850
There's a lot of services out
there that crawl other social

00:47:23.850 --> 00:47:26.920
platforms, that try to
aggregate this data.

00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:29.720
But the problem really lies in
the fact that that data's

00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:33.040
never posted, or people don't
put them in those places for

00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:34.690
everyone to see.

00:47:34.690 --> 00:47:36.670
And so with Arke, we have
our beta right now

00:47:36.670 --> 00:47:37.610
on the Android market.

00:47:37.610 --> 00:47:39.680
You can go down there and
download, A-R-K-E. And the

00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:41.940
experience is very simple
to get started.

00:47:41.940 --> 00:47:43.720
When you download the
app, you sign in

00:47:43.720 --> 00:47:45.290
with your Google account.

00:47:45.290 --> 00:47:47.410
It pulls your basic information,
and you add the

00:47:47.410 --> 00:47:52.020
extra that you'd like-- work,
physical address and such.

00:47:52.020 --> 00:47:54.270
Then as you initiate handshakes
on our network and

00:47:54.270 --> 00:47:57.220
they're accepted, that's
when the magic starts.

00:47:57.220 --> 00:48:00.890
That's when you can decide who
has what information at what

00:48:00.890 --> 00:48:04.280
time and how they
can contact you.

00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:07.060
And it's very powerful when you
think of people changing

00:48:07.060 --> 00:48:09.570
phone numbers, changing physical
addresses, changing

00:48:09.570 --> 00:48:10.720
countries even.

00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:13.070
And being able to send out a
message to six different

00:48:13.070 --> 00:48:15.090
platforms letting people
know about that.

00:48:15.090 --> 00:48:16.870
And then all the problems that
ensue of people writing it

00:48:16.870 --> 00:48:18.480
down wrong, not putting
it in, and losing

00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:20.000
track of those people.

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:22.370
So we have a consumer
model for revenue.

00:48:22.370 --> 00:48:23.670
We have a business
to consumer.

00:48:23.670 --> 00:48:25.280
But one that's really
exciting is our

00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:26.280
business to business one.

00:48:26.280 --> 00:48:30.510
Imagine for marketing not only
to your clients but then to

00:48:30.510 --> 00:48:32.990
also any loyal members
that you have, of an

00:48:32.990 --> 00:48:35.270
always up to date CRM.

00:48:35.270 --> 00:48:37.380
And what that can bring to
businesses of always being

00:48:37.380 --> 00:48:39.980
able to follow their consumers,
or even follow

00:48:39.980 --> 00:48:43.690
other businesses as they move
around, as they expand, as

00:48:43.690 --> 00:48:46.020
they change that information
that again, isn't always

00:48:46.020 --> 00:48:48.730
communicated and isn't
always posted.

00:48:48.730 --> 00:48:50.257
And Arke is looking
to solve that.

00:48:50.257 --> 00:48:51.507
Thank you.

00:48:55.861 --> 00:48:57.650
STEPHANIE PALMERI: I like that
you guys are wearing Glass on

00:48:57.650 --> 00:48:58.350
top of your head.

00:48:58.350 --> 00:49:01.700
It's very stylish.

00:49:01.700 --> 00:49:04.350
I'll probably do
the same thing.

00:49:04.350 --> 00:49:07.175
So I work with a lot of really
early stage companies, and B

00:49:07.175 --> 00:49:11.920
to C, B to B to C, B to C to
B. Where do you start?

00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:12.870
You've got to pick one.

00:49:12.870 --> 00:49:14.840
So where do you start first?

00:49:14.840 --> 00:49:16.986
And then how do you move
to the next market?

00:49:16.986 --> 00:49:18.210
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, it's
a great question.

00:49:18.210 --> 00:49:22.200
So we would start at the
consumer level, having normal,

00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:24.260
everyone in the room, every
day people being able to

00:49:24.260 --> 00:49:26.240
download that app and stay in
touch with family, with

00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:28.180
friends, with college
roommates, all

00:49:28.180 --> 00:49:28.920
of those user groups.

00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:32.080
I mean literally, our target
markets are anyone who uses a

00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:33.310
phone to call.

00:49:33.310 --> 00:49:36.540
And so we have a very wide range
of who we can adopt and

00:49:36.540 --> 00:49:38.130
who can market to.

00:49:38.130 --> 00:49:40.530
And then eventually as that
model becomes successful, it

00:49:40.530 --> 00:49:43.810
only makes sense to then enter
the B to C. So then business

00:49:43.810 --> 00:49:45.610
users can keep track of those
customers that are already

00:49:45.610 --> 00:49:47.190
successful and on the network.

00:49:47.190 --> 00:49:48.860
And then eventually move to
that business to business

00:49:48.860 --> 00:49:52.255
model in different areas such
as IT and also CRM.

00:49:52.255 --> 00:49:54.450
STACY BROWN-PHILPOT: So if
you're starting with B to C,

00:49:54.450 --> 00:49:57.090
how do you deal with privacy?

00:49:57.090 --> 00:50:00.580
If a handshake happens and then
I want to un-handshake

00:50:00.580 --> 00:50:02.260
from people, what do I do?

00:50:02.260 --> 00:50:06.010
How do I easily-- if I
have 2,000 people--

00:50:06.010 --> 00:50:07.190
MALE SPEAKER: That's
a great question.

00:50:07.190 --> 00:50:11.680
So with Arke, there is row level
permissions as well as

00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:13.550
group permissions, to instantly
add someone to

00:50:13.550 --> 00:50:15.390
something that maybe only shares
your work email if

00:50:15.390 --> 00:50:16.400
they're in a work group.

00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:18.510
Whereas family get all
the information.

00:50:18.510 --> 00:50:20.870
And the great part about Arke
is just the power that it

00:50:20.870 --> 00:50:21.640
brings to people.

00:50:21.640 --> 00:50:23.460
You now own your information
again.

00:50:23.460 --> 00:50:26.095
So when you disconnect with
someone, they don't have a way

00:50:26.095 --> 00:50:26.660
to contact you.

00:50:26.660 --> 00:50:28.090
CHRIS MESSINA: So you're saying
people on both ends

00:50:28.090 --> 00:50:29.260
need to use Arke?

00:50:29.260 --> 00:50:30.850
MALE SPEAKER: They do, yes.

00:50:30.850 --> 00:50:31.990
CHRIS DIBONA: It's Plaxo.

00:50:31.990 --> 00:50:33.680
It's just a [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:36.470
CHRIS MESSINA: I know, yeah.

00:50:36.470 --> 00:50:39.520
Part of it too is like, you're
competing with a lot of

00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:43.230
people, including Google, which
is completely fine.

00:50:43.230 --> 00:50:46.120
But if you look at your profile,
you're able to

00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:48.700
provide that information and
choose exactly who can see it.

00:50:48.700 --> 00:50:50.470
And they'll be able to access
that information.

00:50:50.470 --> 00:50:52.000
And we actually merge the
information that you already

00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:54.490
have with that person
in the profile.

00:50:54.490 --> 00:50:57.430
So how would you do something
different or better than what

00:50:57.430 --> 00:50:58.590
we're already doing?

00:50:58.590 --> 00:50:59.540
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, that's
a great question.

00:50:59.540 --> 00:51:02.500
So first and foremost, a lot
of systems out there are

00:51:02.500 --> 00:51:05.090
either platform specific or
they, like I mentioned

00:51:05.090 --> 00:51:06.520
earlier, only crawl sights.

00:51:06.520 --> 00:51:08.280
CHRIS MESSINA: You're
platform specific.

00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:10.560
MALE SPEAKER: So with our
platform model of starting

00:51:10.560 --> 00:51:13.840
with everyone on Arke, we
eventually move into the

00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:15.560
ability for anyone to join.

00:51:15.560 --> 00:51:17.670
And it's also a matter of, with
all these services out

00:51:17.670 --> 00:51:20.240
there that already do it like
Google, people don't think of

00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:23.150
Google as that place to go and
put their information to sync.

00:51:23.150 --> 00:51:24.790
People think of Google,
first comes

00:51:24.790 --> 00:51:26.380
search, then comes Gmail.

00:51:26.380 --> 00:51:28.940
And so by starting with a
feature that everyone else has

00:51:28.940 --> 00:51:31.790
added 10 years down the road, we
feel we can build a better

00:51:31.790 --> 00:51:35.400
ecosystem with that foundation
rather than adding it on later

00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:38.010
as an extra service, that people
don't think of and that

00:51:38.010 --> 00:51:40.180
even in Google's case,
people don't trust.

00:51:43.950 --> 00:51:46.310
CHRIS MESSINA: Ouch.

00:51:46.310 --> 00:51:47.340
I won't take it personally.

00:51:47.340 --> 00:51:49.414
It's all right.

00:51:49.414 --> 00:51:50.664
But I guess we'll
work on that.

00:52:03.769 --> 00:52:07.466
MALE SPEAKER: All right, let's
give a [INAUDIBLE] ovation to

00:52:07.466 --> 00:52:08.716
[INAUDIBLE].

00:52:18.100 --> 00:52:18.740
MALE SPEAKER: How's
it going, guys?

00:52:18.740 --> 00:52:22.090
I'm going to open this
up with a quick--

00:52:22.090 --> 00:52:22.680
oh, that's right.

00:52:22.680 --> 00:52:23.850
Yeah, good call.

00:52:23.850 --> 00:52:26.610
With a quick switch of
the tabs on the web

00:52:26.610 --> 00:52:27.860
browser over here.

00:52:35.210 --> 00:52:37.770
So I'm going to open this up
with a quick little story.

00:52:37.770 --> 00:52:40.100
My wife and I, we are
blessed right now.

00:52:40.100 --> 00:52:41.920
We are pregnant.

00:52:41.920 --> 00:52:42.910
And we go--

00:52:42.910 --> 00:52:45.740
MALE SPEAKER: Actually,
she's pregnant.

00:52:45.740 --> 00:52:46.260
For the record.

00:52:46.260 --> 00:52:47.740
MALE SPEAKER: Believe it or
not, I'm eating for two.

00:52:50.590 --> 00:52:55.320
We go there, and the OB/GYN has
no idea who we are, how

00:52:55.320 --> 00:52:57.730
many times we've been there,
and what we're there for.

00:52:57.730 --> 00:52:59.860
It was incredible.

00:52:59.860 --> 00:53:03.780
And I could not think of a
better situation for Google

00:53:03.780 --> 00:53:07.940
Glass, where the purpose is to
get information into the hands

00:53:07.940 --> 00:53:12.480
that need it when
they need it.

00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:17.210
By implementing technology as
simple as a card with a photo

00:53:17.210 --> 00:53:19.710
on it and EMR information,
electronic medical

00:53:19.710 --> 00:53:23.960
information, like patient's
first name, DOB, height,

00:53:23.960 --> 00:53:28.260
weight, et cetera,
these doctors can

00:53:28.260 --> 00:53:30.590
make decisions faster.

00:53:30.590 --> 00:53:34.150
So for example, 93%
of doctors use

00:53:34.150 --> 00:53:37.060
electronic medical software.

00:53:37.060 --> 00:53:42.400
70% say that it reduces
clinical errors.

00:53:42.400 --> 00:53:46.290
Medical IT spending
is at $69 billion,

00:53:46.290 --> 00:53:47.770
according to our records.

00:53:47.770 --> 00:53:52.930
And it's improving, it's
increasing, at 9.7% a year.

00:53:52.930 --> 00:53:55.430
Not to mention, just imagine
what this could do for

00:53:55.430 --> 00:53:56.885
physicians' NPS scores.

00:54:00.710 --> 00:54:04.560
Hospitals are going to be our
target market, followed by

00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:06.870
large medical groups.

00:54:06.870 --> 00:54:10.170
We would be implementing
a per seat per year

00:54:10.170 --> 00:54:11.420
charge for the service.

00:54:14.270 --> 00:54:16.890
I'm going to close this with
another personal story.

00:54:16.890 --> 00:54:19.800
My dad right now has
prostate cancer.

00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:22.730
And honestly, if there's
anything that I can do to

00:54:22.730 --> 00:54:27.370
improve his patient experience,
I will do this.

00:54:27.370 --> 00:54:32.390
So an investment in us tonight
is an investment in the health

00:54:32.390 --> 00:54:33.860
care of your family.

00:54:44.210 --> 00:54:46.076
DON DODGE: Have you ever tried
to sell anything to hospitals?

00:54:48.710 --> 00:54:50.460
MALE SPEAKER: Though I have
not, we have industry

00:54:50.460 --> 00:54:52.571
contacts that do.

00:54:52.571 --> 00:54:52.950
DON DODGE: OK.

00:54:52.950 --> 00:54:57.140
It's very, very difficult, and
takes a long, long time.

00:54:57.140 --> 00:54:58.310
You'll be an old man.

00:54:58.310 --> 00:54:59.850
MALE SPEAKER: This would be
something that would piggyback

00:54:59.850 --> 00:55:02.020
on top of an existing technology
that would already

00:55:02.020 --> 00:55:06.000
be out there, such as Athena
Health's cloud product.

00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:07.490
CHRIS DIBONA: So my name's
David [? Tortiana. ?]

00:55:07.490 --> 00:55:11.260
I run Partner Health Care's
surgical wing.

00:55:11.260 --> 00:55:12.400
So am I going to be
able to wear these

00:55:12.400 --> 00:55:13.750
inside the OR suite?

00:55:13.750 --> 00:55:15.000
Is that the idea?

00:55:19.330 --> 00:55:22.100
MALE SPEAKER: So our target,
we're thinking just

00:55:22.100 --> 00:55:23.330
pediatricians, initially.

00:55:23.330 --> 00:55:26.780
So you go into your GP or
whatever, and they would have

00:55:26.780 --> 00:55:30.260
it right there in the
office visit.

00:55:30.260 --> 00:55:32.570
MALE SPEAKER: It also includes
additional features such as

00:55:32.570 --> 00:55:34.870
the geofencing, where you could
set it up on a per room

00:55:34.870 --> 00:55:36.320
by per room basis.

00:55:36.320 --> 00:55:39.340
And when the physician, when a
doc enters that room, it can

00:55:39.340 --> 00:55:43.040
actually trigger an event that
loads that person's data.

00:55:43.040 --> 00:55:44.850
CHRIS MESSINA: What type of
hardware certification would

00:55:44.850 --> 00:55:46.700
Glass have to meet in
order to be used in

00:55:46.700 --> 00:55:49.610
this kind of context?

00:55:49.610 --> 00:55:51.240
MALE SPEAKER: That's going
to be a tough question.

00:55:51.240 --> 00:55:54.160
All the medical records and
making sure that it's

00:55:54.160 --> 00:55:55.160
privately protected.

00:55:55.160 --> 00:55:56.880
I don't think the
current API--

00:55:56.880 --> 00:55:59.950
we'll probably have to go to
the GTK which they just

00:55:59.950 --> 00:56:00.950
announced today.

00:56:00.950 --> 00:56:03.610
So that you could directly talk
to the medical system, as

00:56:03.610 --> 00:56:06.140
opposed to storing it
on Google servers.

00:56:06.140 --> 00:56:08.015
So that would be an issue
we'd have to resolve.

00:56:13.890 --> 00:56:15.340
CHRIS DIBONA: Have you put
your Glass through an

00:56:15.340 --> 00:56:16.590
autoclave yet?

00:56:19.174 --> 00:56:20.530
MALE SPEAKER: I have not.

00:56:20.530 --> 00:56:24.300
But I saw it go through a
blender in the hacking class.

00:56:24.300 --> 00:56:26.670
And it actually didn't
fare so well.

00:56:26.670 --> 00:56:30.700
But I got to imagine it was a
cosmetic [? dilemma ?] anyway.

00:56:30.700 --> 00:56:33.180
STACY BROWN-PHILPOT: I think
this is interesting if you

00:56:33.180 --> 00:56:37.670
actually have more information
beyond what that specific

00:56:37.670 --> 00:56:39.060
physician knows about you.

00:56:39.060 --> 00:56:42.330
So if you're going to the
pediatrician, and you know

00:56:42.330 --> 00:56:45.190
something about the parents.

00:56:45.190 --> 00:56:49.000
Or if you're going to the
OB/GYN, and you know something

00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:50.170
from the pediatrician.

00:56:50.170 --> 00:56:53.645
The cross information of data is
more interesting than just

00:56:53.645 --> 00:56:56.120
the specific information
to me.

00:56:56.120 --> 00:56:58.320
MALE SPEAKER: Some of these
companies also have CRM

00:56:58.320 --> 00:57:00.410
software that could be
integrated as well.

00:57:00.410 --> 00:57:04.360
And you could have literally a
ticker that's scrolling with

00:57:04.360 --> 00:57:05.610
the most relevant information.

00:57:08.686 --> 00:57:11.480
CHRIS MESSINA: So Google tried
a health product a

00:57:11.480 --> 00:57:12.220
little while ago.

00:57:12.220 --> 00:57:17.870
And I'm wondering if things have
changed enough now where,

00:57:17.870 --> 00:57:20.730
if instead of worrying about
the physicians having these

00:57:20.730 --> 00:57:25.230
types of tools, that if
individuals have access to the

00:57:25.230 --> 00:57:27.290
stuff, have a way of storing
this information, have a way

00:57:27.290 --> 00:57:29.730
of, let's say, using Glass to
actually pull up their medical

00:57:29.730 --> 00:57:32.290
information, that maybe a better
approach, a simpler

00:57:32.290 --> 00:57:34.850
approach, a faster to market
approach, would actually be to

00:57:34.850 --> 00:57:37.710
sort of revisit that, an
individual storing or

00:57:37.710 --> 00:57:40.840
collecting their own
information.

00:57:40.840 --> 00:57:42.090
What do you think about that?

00:57:45.830 --> 00:57:48.710
MALE SPEAKER: Well, that's
a total switch, I think.

00:57:48.710 --> 00:57:51.020
Total 100%.

00:57:51.020 --> 00:57:52.000
I mean, I think there's
a lot of

00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:53.600
applications in health care.

00:57:53.600 --> 00:57:55.160
And that could be one.

00:57:55.160 --> 00:57:56.850
I think the one that we're
on could be an

00:57:56.850 --> 00:57:59.111
interesting one, as well.

00:57:59.111 --> 00:58:00.544
MALE SPEAKER: Thank
you very much.

00:58:05.384 --> 00:58:08.424
Let's give a friendly ovation
to Social Charge.

00:58:16.400 --> 00:58:17.320
FEMALE SPEAKER: First of
all, thank you for

00:58:17.320 --> 00:58:19.230
saying the name right.

00:58:19.230 --> 00:58:20.480
Social Charge.

00:58:30.410 --> 00:58:34.180
Don't you just hate it when your
devices run out of power

00:58:34.180 --> 00:58:35.480
when you're on the go?

00:58:35.480 --> 00:58:36.040
CHRIS DIBONA: Oh, I hate that.

00:58:36.040 --> 00:58:36.960
FEMALE SPEAKER: I know.

00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:40.030
So do I. Forget your charger?

00:58:40.030 --> 00:58:42.950
Too many chargers to
carry in your bag.

00:58:42.950 --> 00:58:45.010
This is a problem that
we are all facing.

00:58:45.010 --> 00:58:46.890
CHRIS DIBONA: I hate that!

00:58:46.890 --> 00:58:49.560
FEMALE SPEAKER: So Social
Charger, we provide you the

00:58:49.560 --> 00:58:55.580
solution through this 24/7
convenient, reliable, and

00:58:55.580 --> 00:58:57.290
established solution.

00:58:57.290 --> 00:59:03.030
What we offer, we offer a
product with a sphere-like

00:59:03.030 --> 00:59:06.500
stylish product that
could power charge

00:59:06.500 --> 00:59:07.750
most of your device.

00:59:10.410 --> 00:59:14.330
We would partner with partners
like [INAUDIBLE]

00:59:14.330 --> 00:59:19.400
taxi drivers, Peet's Coffee,
an airport location,

00:59:19.400 --> 00:59:22.010
convenient locations for
you to charge your

00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:24.030
devices on the go.

00:59:24.030 --> 00:59:28.640
We want to provide a social
app where you can get

00:59:28.640 --> 00:59:32.010
notifications when your device
are low on power.

00:59:32.010 --> 00:59:37.270
You see through Google Maps
where are the convenient

00:59:37.270 --> 00:59:40.610
Social Charger locations are
to guide you to the nearest

00:59:40.610 --> 00:59:44.390
salvation point.

00:59:44.390 --> 00:59:49.630
Now the market is huge.

00:59:49.630 --> 00:59:55.080
By 2020, there are 10 billion
connected devices.

00:59:55.080 --> 00:59:58.600
Only counting 1% of the devices
charging five minutes

00:59:58.600 --> 01:00:01.690
per month, we're looking
at a $1 billion market.

01:00:01.690 --> 01:00:03.490
Of course, the pie is huge.

01:00:03.490 --> 01:00:06.690
But we're looking at starting
at a small place.

01:00:06.690 --> 01:00:09.500
Well, our huge San
Francisco place.

01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:13.010
And we want to scale and expand
through partners with

01:00:13.010 --> 01:00:13.510
[INAUDIBLE]

01:00:13.510 --> 01:00:15.930
like natural synergy
companies.

01:00:15.930 --> 01:00:19.660
And you may ask, how
do we make money?

01:00:19.660 --> 01:00:21.370
We make money two ways.

01:00:21.370 --> 01:00:25.690
Number one, through advertising
with AdSense.

01:00:25.690 --> 01:00:30.110
And number two, through charging
per minute charge

01:00:30.110 --> 01:00:31.410
with Google Wallet.

01:00:31.410 --> 01:00:32.660
Thank you.

01:00:38.250 --> 01:00:40.880
CHRIS DIBONA: So I think your
battery starved model is the

01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:43.820
same woman as the barista
in that last pitch?

01:00:43.820 --> 01:00:45.280
No, no.

01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:47.480
So is the idea to distribute
batteries to all these

01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:49.215
drivers, or what's
your goal here?

01:00:49.215 --> 01:00:51.060
FEMALE SPEAKER: Taxi drivers.

01:00:51.060 --> 01:00:51.810
CHRIS DIBONA: Charged
batteries?

01:00:51.810 --> 01:00:52.110
FEMALE SPEAKER: Airport.

01:00:52.110 --> 01:00:54.780
So we'll provide many
charge stations.

01:00:54.780 --> 01:00:58.880
CHRIS DIBONA: So you're going to
have Nexus cues everywhere.

01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:00.180
CHRIS MESSINA: We've got to
do something with them.

01:01:05.140 --> 01:01:06.540
FEMALE SPEAKER: 2 plus
1 Google point.

01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:11.740
CHRIS MESSINA: So
wait a second.

01:01:11.740 --> 01:01:16.640
Whenever I order an Uber, or a
Lift, or whatever, or SideCar,

01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:18.110
or what are the other ones?

01:01:18.110 --> 01:01:19.740
Like Slice and Taxi.

01:01:19.740 --> 01:01:20.780
I don't know Taxi.

01:01:20.780 --> 01:01:23.500
I'll have to download that.

01:01:23.500 --> 01:01:27.090
Anyways, I'm like, hey dude,
do you mind if I plug in to

01:01:27.090 --> 01:01:29.460
your power thing in the front?

01:01:29.460 --> 01:01:30.750
And he does it for free.

01:01:30.750 --> 01:01:33.260
So isn't your competition
free?

01:01:33.260 --> 01:01:35.160
FEMALE SPEAKER: One device, your
smart device, was iPhone,

01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:36.580
he'd probably have
that charger.

01:01:36.580 --> 01:01:37.580
Lucky for you.

01:01:37.580 --> 01:01:44.090
However, I'm carrying my iPad,
my Lenovo laptop, Ultra OU1,

01:01:44.090 --> 01:01:45.140
all this kind of--

01:01:45.140 --> 01:01:47.080
CHRIS MESSINA: Your Blueberry,
and your Blackberry, and your

01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:48.070
Windows Phone.

01:01:48.070 --> 01:01:48.920
FEMALE SPEAKER: I do not--

01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:50.120
my purse is not that big.

01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:51.370
I need to be stylish.

01:01:54.620 --> 01:01:56.500
CHRIS DIBONA: Are you saying
Androids aren't stylish?

01:01:56.500 --> 01:01:58.390
MALE SPEAKER: This also allows
a way for them to make a

01:01:58.390 --> 01:01:59.966
little bit more money.

01:01:59.966 --> 01:02:03.040
FEMALE SPEAKER: It's a revenue
share through with our

01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:04.550
partner, with taxi drivers.

01:02:04.550 --> 01:02:05.530
CHRIS MESSINA: I'm just going
to give them my phone.

01:02:05.530 --> 01:02:07.130
This is going to cost
way too much money

01:02:07.130 --> 01:02:09.808
for me to live anymore.

01:02:09.808 --> 01:02:10.480
I'm kidding.

01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:11.430
I'm not giving them my phone.

01:02:11.430 --> 01:02:14.070
FEMALE SPEAKER: We're looking
at prototyping, targeting

01:02:14.070 --> 01:02:16.330
maybe around $20 per device.

01:02:16.330 --> 01:02:19.740
So we're looking at starting
with San Francisco, starting

01:02:19.740 --> 01:02:22.700
was 2,000 device to start
with, partner with.

01:02:22.700 --> 01:02:26.630
That's probably $100,000
on that, $2 million.

01:02:26.630 --> 01:02:27.980
That would get us started.

01:02:27.980 --> 01:02:30.840
DON DODGE: How much per minute
is it to charge?

01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:33.780
FEMALE SPEAKER: We're looking
at the initial model, to be

01:02:33.780 --> 01:02:37.370
work in progress, we're looking
at $0.25 per minute.

01:02:37.370 --> 01:02:42.040
DON DODGE: And how long does
it take to charge a phone?

01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:43.800
FEMALE SPEAKER: Assuming power
charging, that we can

01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:44.880
[INAUDIBLE]

01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:49.440
some super magnetic product,
then we're looking at five

01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:50.310
minutes charging time.

01:02:50.310 --> 01:02:50.670
DON DODGE: Five minutes.

01:02:50.670 --> 01:02:52.850
So this charges super fast.

01:02:52.850 --> 01:02:54.210
FEMALE SPEAKER: That's
our goal.

01:02:54.210 --> 01:02:56.170
MALE SPEAKER: We're thinking
of leveraging the super

01:02:56.170 --> 01:02:58.270
charged thing you can
see at airports.

01:02:58.270 --> 01:03:00.380
And we're also thinking of
possibly doing some sort of

01:03:00.380 --> 01:03:03.295
advertising model where you can
look at an advertisement

01:03:03.295 --> 01:03:03.730
instead of--

01:03:03.730 --> 01:03:04.582
STACY BROWN-PHILPOT: What's
the ad model?

01:03:04.582 --> 01:03:06.800
I don't get that.

01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:10.265
I mean, is 3D images going
to come out of the--

01:03:10.265 --> 01:03:10.620
FEMALE SPEAKER: Potentially.

01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:12.770
We can partner with
Google to do that.

01:03:20.105 --> 01:03:23.020
Our thinking is, when you're
charging your device for five

01:03:23.020 --> 01:03:25.450
minutes, you're really
linked to the device.

01:03:25.450 --> 01:03:28.410
And then through that time, your
captured audience, and

01:03:28.410 --> 01:03:31.120
with that 3D projection,
you can really

01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:32.090
change people's mind.

01:03:32.090 --> 01:03:36.490
CHRIS DIBONA: So since we're
being fabulous, I'm Elon Musk.

01:03:36.490 --> 01:03:40.630
Could I trade in my Tesla
for a charged Tesla?

01:03:40.630 --> 01:03:42.530
FEMALE SPEAKER: That would
be a great idea.

01:03:42.530 --> 01:03:44.870
DON DODGE: No, this actually is
a big problem, to be able

01:03:44.870 --> 01:03:48.400
to supercharge your phone super
fast, that's a big deal.

01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:50.230
I'd pay for that.

01:03:50.230 --> 01:03:51.590
STEPHANIE PALMERI: How big
is this going to be?

01:03:51.590 --> 01:03:53.530
Is this going to be a thing I
could put in my purse and run

01:03:53.530 --> 01:03:55.590
off with when I get
out of the Uber.

01:03:55.590 --> 01:03:57.450
FEMALE SPEAKER: This is probably
not fitting the

01:03:57.450 --> 01:04:01.820
prototype, but we
would partner--

01:04:01.820 --> 01:04:04.770
place it at a Peet's or airport
or taxi, they will

01:04:04.770 --> 01:04:06.640
provide plenty of space.

01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:08.440
But probably not
personal purse.

01:04:08.440 --> 01:04:09.120
STEPHANIE PALMERI: Is it big?

01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:10.420
Is it--

01:04:10.420 --> 01:04:11.810
I can't tell from the picture.

01:04:11.810 --> 01:04:13.240
Is it life sized there?

01:04:16.830 --> 01:04:18.679
MALE SPEAKER: All right,
thank you so much.

01:04:18.679 --> 01:04:19.929
FEMALE SPEAKER: Thank you.

01:04:26.074 --> 01:04:28.840
MALE SPEAKER: All right, last
but not least, Easy Ad.

01:05:03.350 --> 01:05:04.600
Go for it.

01:05:12.340 --> 01:05:15.740
CHRIS DIBONA: Is this Easy
Ad with two d's or one d?

01:05:15.740 --> 01:05:17.090
MALE SPEAKER: One d.

01:05:17.090 --> 01:05:19.110
CHRIS DIBONA: Is it
E-Z or E-A-S-Y?

01:05:21.750 --> 01:05:24.360
Yes?

01:05:24.360 --> 01:05:24.890
Not helpful.

01:05:24.890 --> 01:05:28.500
Because our Bingo card says, if
they don't have vowels or

01:05:28.500 --> 01:05:32.620
do short spellings, we
get extra points.

01:05:32.620 --> 01:05:34.950
Is it Easy Ad, does
it end in .ly?

01:05:38.055 --> 01:05:41.000
Ad.ly?

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:44.712
Is that an i or a bracket
at the end there?

01:05:44.712 --> 01:05:46.120
CHRIS MESSINA: It's good.

01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:50.250
OK, let's go

01:05:50.250 --> 01:05:52.040
FEMALE SPEAKER: Hi.

01:05:52.040 --> 01:05:53.860
We want to have a quick
question and quick

01:05:53.860 --> 01:05:55.080
conversation with you guys.

01:05:55.080 --> 01:06:02.360
So how many of you guys have
made apps, or are thinking of

01:06:02.360 --> 01:06:05.365
making one?

01:06:05.365 --> 01:06:08.160
Awesome.

01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:10.150
So the problem is that
most mobile app

01:06:10.150 --> 01:06:11.660
startups have great ideas.

01:06:11.660 --> 01:06:13.900
But they have a hard time
finding the right advertisers

01:06:13.900 --> 01:06:16.686
and don't know how to integrate
ads into their app

01:06:16.686 --> 01:06:20.560
for a great user experience
that's not intrusive.

01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:23.010
And this is a design problem--

01:06:23.010 --> 01:06:25.350
so something that might pop up
or something that's flashing,

01:06:25.350 --> 01:06:26.840
the banner, what have you.

01:06:26.840 --> 01:06:28.560
So the solution is Easy Ad.

01:06:28.560 --> 01:06:32.600
We are a service that connects
app makers to advertisers.

01:06:32.600 --> 01:06:35.820
App developers can finally
concentrate on making an app

01:06:35.820 --> 01:06:37.610
instead of figuring out
how to monetize it.

01:06:42.020 --> 01:06:43.690
MALE SPEAKER: Easy Ad has
two main components--

01:06:43.690 --> 01:06:46.150
the client that is installed
with the app developer's app,

01:06:46.150 --> 01:06:49.150
and our back end service that
returns ad content based on

01:06:49.150 --> 01:06:50.880
demographic and location
information.

01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:52.440
The app developer does
not need to know

01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:54.330
anything about the ad.

01:06:54.330 --> 01:06:58.500
The workflow is, the app
developer gets demographic and

01:06:58.500 --> 01:07:02.740
location information from their
Facebook login or their

01:07:02.740 --> 01:07:07.160
proprietary own login and the
device's geographic location.

01:07:09.710 --> 01:07:13.600
That information is sent to our
Google cloud, which has

01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:15.880
our services running on it.

01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:19.040
Easy Ad dynamically gets the
advertiser content based on

01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:21.710
the user's demographics
and location and

01:07:21.710 --> 01:07:23.440
returns the ad content.

01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:27.660
Our Easy Ad app component,
that's a library with their

01:07:27.660 --> 01:07:32.510
app, displays an ad overlay,
that's very subtle, seamlessly

01:07:32.510 --> 01:07:36.020
over the application, using
one of our many templates.

01:07:36.020 --> 01:07:38.660
For example, the
semi-transparent ad overlay

01:07:38.660 --> 01:07:41.030
walks a company and product
name over the

01:07:41.030 --> 01:07:42.280
bottom of the screen.

01:07:45.310 --> 01:07:47.240
FEMALE SPEAKER: So our target
audience is anyone who has

01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:49.130
created an app or wants
to create an app.

01:07:49.130 --> 01:07:52.440
There's over 900,000
active apps on iOS.

01:07:52.440 --> 01:07:56.200
And from iO, there's 900,000
Android apps.

01:08:16.189 --> 01:08:18.100
CHRIS DIBONA: So what would you
say the opportunity would

01:08:18.100 --> 01:08:19.510
be for advertising?

01:08:19.510 --> 01:08:21.080
So I'm an app developer.

01:08:21.080 --> 01:08:23.109
I like apps.

01:08:23.109 --> 01:08:26.069
So how hard is it for me to
integrate this into my

01:08:26.069 --> 01:08:28.245
application slash website?

01:08:32.200 --> 01:08:34.880
MALE SPEAKER: So this is a
library that you would use

01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:37.244
with your Android or
iOS application.

01:08:37.244 --> 01:08:39.370
That you install it once
along with it.

01:08:39.370 --> 01:08:40.779
And you don't have to
worry about it.

01:08:40.779 --> 01:08:43.600
Once you install that library
while you're developing your

01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:46.000
application, you just need to
link up, like we said, the

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.510
Facebook token or your own
proprietary token that you

01:08:48.510 --> 01:08:49.580
send to us.

01:08:49.580 --> 01:08:52.040
And we overlay that in
a very subtle way.

01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:52.859
We want to be very subtle.

01:08:52.859 --> 01:08:55.090
We don't want to be the
ads that we all

01:08:55.090 --> 01:08:56.800
see, the pop-up ad.

01:08:56.800 --> 01:08:58.750
This is subtle.

01:08:58.750 --> 01:09:01.290
Your eye is not really going
to be super drawn to it.

01:09:01.290 --> 01:09:02.450
But it's going to
be very subtle.

01:09:02.450 --> 01:09:03.649
Because we concentrate
on design.

01:09:03.649 --> 01:09:04.399
That's what we do.

01:09:04.399 --> 01:09:09.120
So our product is, we outsource
that ad, the

01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:11.430
connector to the actual
advertisers, as well as

01:09:11.430 --> 01:09:14.890
creating really nice looking,
subtle ads for you.

01:09:14.890 --> 01:09:15.600
So you can concentrate--

01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:17.384
CHRIS MESSINA: So you're
basically an ad agency?

01:09:17.384 --> 01:09:17.790
MALE SPEAKER: No.

01:09:17.790 --> 01:09:20.584
We connect you with
the advertisers.

01:09:23.114 --> 01:09:24.050
STEPHANIE PALMERI: Who do
you connect us with?

01:09:24.050 --> 01:09:26.950
The advertisers or the app
developers or the--

01:09:32.890 --> 01:09:33.899
I'm an app developer.

01:09:33.899 --> 01:09:35.149
You're connecting me to who?

01:09:39.029 --> 01:09:40.590
MALE SPEAKER: We would
work with Ford.

01:09:40.590 --> 01:09:42.149
And so you have an app.

01:09:42.149 --> 01:09:45.180
You're creating Seamless,
or whatever the app is.

01:09:45.180 --> 01:09:47.380
So you would just send us the
demographic information,

01:09:47.380 --> 01:09:49.620
demographic and location
information, location so we

01:09:49.620 --> 01:09:52.319
can connect you to a
local business if

01:09:52.319 --> 01:09:53.689
you want to do that.

01:09:53.689 --> 01:09:55.920
And then we connect you with
Ford based on that

01:09:55.920 --> 01:09:56.235
demographic.

01:09:56.235 --> 01:09:59.910
Say OK, Ford wants to sell to
30 to 40 year olds in this

01:09:59.910 --> 01:10:01.070
specific location.

01:10:01.070 --> 01:10:04.880
We send the ad back.

01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:06.130
STEPHANIE PALMERI: You're
now the target market.

01:10:09.430 --> 01:10:11.270
CHRIS MESSINA: What kind of
rules are there about passing

01:10:11.270 --> 01:10:13.860
this data on that you
get from Facebook?

01:10:13.860 --> 01:10:15.730
Are you able to just sort of
like smear that data all over

01:10:15.730 --> 01:10:17.330
the place, or what?

01:10:17.330 --> 01:10:19.560
MALE SPEAKER: This is your
basic Facebook profile

01:10:19.560 --> 01:10:21.250
information, just the
basic information.

01:10:21.250 --> 01:10:21.480
CHRIS MESSINA: Right.

01:10:21.480 --> 01:10:23.990
But I provided that information
to the app.

01:10:23.990 --> 01:10:27.300
And so then the app hands that
off to you, the advertising

01:10:27.300 --> 01:10:28.270
sort of go between.

01:10:28.270 --> 01:10:30.370
And then you give that to--

01:10:30.370 --> 01:10:31.100
MALE SPEAKER: We do.

01:10:31.100 --> 01:10:33.970
But the good thing about this is
that this is the most basic

01:10:33.970 --> 01:10:35.310
information.

01:10:35.310 --> 01:10:37.050
How many times have you
installed an app, and it asks

01:10:37.050 --> 01:10:38.370
for all these different
things?

01:10:38.370 --> 01:10:39.990
Like I installed Sonar
last night.

01:10:39.990 --> 01:10:41.120
I didn't even know if I
wanted to click OK.

01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:42.550
Because it was like 80
different things

01:10:42.550 --> 01:10:43.470
it wanted to get.

01:10:43.470 --> 01:10:46.340
We're doing the most basic
one, basic information.

01:10:46.340 --> 01:10:47.620
That's date of birth.

01:10:47.620 --> 01:10:48.850
That's what country.

01:10:48.850 --> 01:10:51.310
CHRIS MESSINA: I mean, that's
all PII, still, right?

01:10:51.310 --> 01:10:53.320
MALE SPEAKER: But that's
a Facebook token.

01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:54.810
That's what everybody's
Facebook token.

01:10:54.810 --> 01:10:56.060
Whenever you click a
Facebook login or

01:10:56.060 --> 01:10:58.920
sign up, that is sent.

01:10:58.920 --> 01:11:01.760
STACY BROWN-PHILPOT: I think
there's a bigger opportunity

01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:05.240
to actually serve ads that the
people want to see that are

01:11:05.240 --> 01:11:09.710
using the app, instead of the
ad that Ford wants to serve.

01:11:09.710 --> 01:11:10.440
MALE SPEAKER: Think about
this, though.

01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:14.650
So we're trying to solve the
monetization problem for the

01:11:14.650 --> 01:11:15.310
app designer.

01:11:15.310 --> 01:11:18.780
If it's Seamless, and their
businesses is getting food

01:11:18.780 --> 01:11:21.250
delivery to people, they don't
want to have to think about

01:11:21.250 --> 01:11:22.530
advertising and all this
kind of stuff.

01:11:22.530 --> 01:11:24.390
That's not their business.

01:11:24.390 --> 01:11:27.400
But about the application isn't
really relevant, either.

01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:30.420
It's really about who
you are, your

01:11:30.420 --> 01:11:31.670
demographic, your location.

01:11:39.270 --> 01:11:40.870
MALE SPEAKER: Here's the other
piece too, is that--

01:11:40.870 --> 01:11:41.806
MALE SPEAKER: All right,
thank you so much.

01:11:41.806 --> 01:11:43.056
MALE SPEAKER: Oh, sorry.

01:11:47.900 --> 01:11:49.010
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah,
we finished.

01:11:49.010 --> 01:11:50.946
Round of applause
for everyone.

01:11:50.946 --> 01:11:52.196
Woo!

01:11:54.890 --> 01:11:56.590
Thanks for standing up.

01:11:56.590 --> 01:11:58.130
All right, so this is
going to be quick.

01:11:58.130 --> 01:12:00.970
Judges, if you guys can follow
Ahmed to, I think we're going

01:12:00.970 --> 01:12:03.270
to use that conference
room over there.

01:12:03.270 --> 01:12:06.780
Decide of the last
hour, which five

01:12:06.780 --> 01:12:08.135
minutes are your favorite.

01:12:08.135 --> 01:12:09.880
We're going to stay here,
maybe do a few

01:12:09.880 --> 01:12:10.840
interviews in the back.

01:12:10.840 --> 01:12:14.180
So if we pull you aside, we've
got some questions for you.

01:12:14.180 --> 01:12:15.940
Martin's also throwing up a
survey here if you guys have

01:12:15.940 --> 01:12:18.900
some brutal advice or
input, comments,

01:12:18.900 --> 01:12:20.580
whatever, for the event.

01:12:20.580 --> 01:12:22.010
But yeah, stay tuned.

01:12:22.010 --> 01:12:23.540
And we'll elect a winner.

01:12:23.540 --> 01:12:24.790
So let's hang around.

01:12:30.330 --> 01:12:31.840
INTERVIEWER: Welcome to Pitch
Night, gentlemen.

01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:32.160
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you.

01:12:32.160 --> 01:12:33.050
Glad to be here.

01:12:33.050 --> 01:12:33.380
MALE SPEAKER: One more thing.

01:12:33.380 --> 01:12:35.120
If you spoke into
this microphone

01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:37.820
tonight, we filmed you.

01:12:37.820 --> 01:12:39.850
I don't know if you knew that.

01:12:39.850 --> 01:12:44.440
We also have a release if you
guys want to be shown in our

01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:46.620
video, which we'll probably
put online afterwards.

01:12:46.620 --> 01:12:52.320
So I think we're going to have
someone standing where?

01:12:52.320 --> 01:12:52.920
Right here.

01:12:52.920 --> 01:12:53.340
OK.

01:12:53.340 --> 01:12:56.320
So if you spoke on this
microphone, come see us.

01:12:56.320 --> 01:12:57.570
Yeah.

01:13:00.220 --> 01:13:02.220
INTERVIEWER: Welcome to
Pitch Night, everyone.

01:13:02.220 --> 01:13:04.260
I'm here with [? Scodio. ?]

01:13:04.260 --> 01:13:06.130
So guys, what was your
inspiration for

01:13:06.130 --> 01:13:07.500
your product tonight?

01:13:07.500 --> 01:13:10.090
MALE SPEAKER: I think our
inspiration came really from,

01:13:10.090 --> 01:13:11.650
we all play games.

01:13:11.650 --> 01:13:15.150
We love gaming in mobile
and PC and all this.

01:13:15.150 --> 01:13:18.560
And just the fact that we were
playing games and being

01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:23.780
constantly cheated, and losing
to people unfairly, it was

01:13:23.780 --> 01:13:24.690
terrible for us.

01:13:24.690 --> 01:13:27.640
I think that's what really
pushed us to really come up

01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:29.620
with a solution for
those cheats.

01:13:29.620 --> 01:13:31.360
And come up with an anti-cheat
system that

01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:33.210
really works for mobile.

01:13:33.210 --> 01:13:34.340
INTERVIEWER: Excellent.

01:13:34.340 --> 01:13:36.130
So did you come to this
event with this idea?

01:13:36.130 --> 01:13:37.720
Is this something you've
been working on?

01:13:37.720 --> 01:13:38.120
MALE SPEAKER: We did.

01:13:38.120 --> 01:13:42.640
It was actually something that,
again, we play a lot of

01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:43.470
games online.

01:13:43.470 --> 01:13:46.860
And just constantly getting
cheated over and over again,

01:13:46.860 --> 01:13:48.740
we said, guys, we've got to
do something about this.

01:13:48.740 --> 01:13:51.340
And really that's how
it came about.

01:13:51.340 --> 01:13:51.970
INTERVIEWER: Awesome.

01:13:51.970 --> 01:13:54.330
So how do you feel like the
pitch went tonight?

01:13:54.330 --> 01:13:56.780
MALE SPEAKER: We thought
it went pretty good.

01:13:56.780 --> 01:13:58.310
We were a little bit
nervous at first.

01:13:58.310 --> 01:14:01.605
And slowly, got more calm.

01:14:01.605 --> 01:14:05.760
And I think people understood
what the whole concept of our

01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:06.750
product is.

01:14:06.750 --> 01:14:07.420
INTERVIEWER: Excellent.

01:14:07.420 --> 01:14:09.820
So do you think that the
feedback that the judges gave

01:14:09.820 --> 01:14:11.665
helped shape your
product at all?

01:14:11.665 --> 01:14:12.300
MALE SPEAKER: I think so.

01:14:12.300 --> 01:14:15.350
I think the feedback was
objective, which is always

01:14:15.350 --> 01:14:16.500
something we appreciate.

01:14:16.500 --> 01:14:22.110
And also, it was from leaders
in the industry, and people

01:14:22.110 --> 01:14:23.050
who have the experience.

01:14:23.050 --> 01:14:24.990
So it's always great
to hear from them.

01:14:24.990 --> 01:14:25.380
INTERVIEWER: Excellent.

01:14:25.380 --> 01:14:26.990
Will, tell us just a little
bit about your product.

01:14:29.770 --> 01:14:30.900
MALE SPEAKER: So what
[? Scodio ?]

01:14:30.900 --> 01:14:33.540
is, is an anti-cheat solution
for mobile games.

01:14:33.540 --> 01:14:36.240
We currently support both
iOS and Android.

01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:38.820
And we have an SDK for
both platforms.

01:14:38.820 --> 01:14:42.810
So developers can just go sign
in, download the SDK, and

01:14:42.810 --> 01:14:46.300
really in a matter of five
minutes, they can go in and

01:14:46.300 --> 01:14:48.620
integrate their games
with our solution.

01:14:48.620 --> 01:14:51.985
And this way, they'll be able
to pretty much block every

01:14:51.985 --> 01:14:55.650
single cheat out there, as long
as it's listed in our

01:14:55.650 --> 01:14:57.460
cheat database.

01:14:57.460 --> 01:14:57.760
INTERVIEWER: Excellent.

01:14:57.760 --> 01:14:58.830
Well, thanks a lot, gentlemen.

01:14:58.830 --> 01:15:00.280
MALE SPEAKER: Thanks
for having us.

01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:01.530
INTERVIEWER: Great.

01:15:35.170 --> 01:15:36.420
INTERVIEWER: You'll find
out, won't you?

01:15:38.970 --> 01:15:39.540
Great.

01:15:39.540 --> 01:15:41.680
So you guys want to introduce
yourselves and what group

01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:44.620
you're with today?

01:15:44.620 --> 01:15:45.730
In the mic, so they can hear.

01:15:45.730 --> 01:15:46.840
ALEX PALMER: I'm Alex Palmer.

01:15:46.840 --> 01:15:49.170
And we're with the group
that did the Glass

01:15:49.170 --> 01:15:51.050
project on Glass MD.

01:15:51.050 --> 01:15:53.550
INTERVIEWER: Glass MD, OK.

01:15:53.550 --> 01:15:53.900
MALE SPEAKER: I'm Sasha.

01:15:53.900 --> 01:15:56.077
And I'm a developer based
out of New York.

01:15:56.077 --> 01:15:58.710
And I'm the same thing,
Glass MD.

01:15:58.710 --> 01:15:59.160
INTERVIEWER: Great.

01:15:59.160 --> 01:16:00.480
Do you guys want to talk a
little bit about how you came

01:16:00.480 --> 01:16:04.040
up with the idea, and how it was
developed over the night

01:16:04.040 --> 01:16:07.640
or before the event?

01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:10.890
ALEX PALMER: So we all split up,
and had separate projects.

01:16:10.890 --> 01:16:14.690
And so the two of us were on a
separate project for most of

01:16:14.690 --> 01:16:18.590
it until the end, when we voted
on the final projects

01:16:18.590 --> 01:16:19.660
that would go on.

01:16:19.660 --> 01:16:21.660
So I don't know very much about
the early development.

01:16:21.660 --> 01:16:23.995
But we can talk a little
bit about what we

01:16:23.995 --> 01:16:24.860
did to develop ours.

01:16:24.860 --> 01:16:25.940
INTERVIEWER: Sure, go for it.

01:16:25.940 --> 01:16:29.350
ALEX PALMER: So we were going
to do an app for like a

01:16:29.350 --> 01:16:30.010
teleprompter.

01:16:30.010 --> 01:16:32.780
So essentially, you've got
people, and they're looking

01:16:32.780 --> 01:16:34.010
down at a teleprompter.

01:16:34.010 --> 01:16:37.600
And when they look down, you've
got the problem of you

01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:39.050
want to have good eye contact.

01:16:39.050 --> 01:16:41.320
So it's nice because you
have good eye contact.

01:16:41.320 --> 01:16:44.310
But some of the problems you
have are, you've got slides

01:16:44.310 --> 01:16:46.830
that you want to have synced
up to your Glass.

01:16:46.830 --> 01:16:48.140
So there are a couple of
things that you can do.

01:16:48.140 --> 01:16:50.350
You can swipe.

01:16:50.350 --> 01:16:54.910
And as you swipe, it will
change the slides in the

01:16:54.910 --> 01:16:56.160
background.

01:16:58.090 --> 01:17:01.060
But you might have too much
text for a specific slide.

01:17:01.060 --> 01:17:03.780
So you need to think of
a way to solve that.

01:17:03.780 --> 01:17:06.920
And so some of the things that
we talked about were a look

01:17:06.920 --> 01:17:08.970
down feature, where when
you look down, it

01:17:08.970 --> 01:17:09.740
starts to scroll down.

01:17:09.740 --> 01:17:12.080
And then you look back level,
and it levels out and stops.

01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:15.500
So you can read and scroll
at the same time.

01:17:15.500 --> 01:17:17.270
INTERVIEWER: Was this one of
the pitches that just went?

01:17:17.270 --> 01:17:17.840
ALEX PALMER: No.

01:17:17.840 --> 01:17:21.830
Because we were on
separate teams.

01:17:21.830 --> 01:17:25.470
Because we all split up into
I think four projects.

01:17:25.470 --> 01:17:26.270
INTERVIEWER: What were
some of the other

01:17:26.270 --> 01:17:27.520
ideas, just out of curiosity?

01:17:30.380 --> 01:17:33.240
ALEX PALMER: So we had--

01:17:33.240 --> 01:17:36.800
MALE SPEAKER: I think one idea
was the business on the go.

01:17:36.800 --> 01:17:40.360
So like a live, real
time translation.

01:17:40.360 --> 01:17:45.010
So what happens is, I think they
were trying to market it

01:17:45.010 --> 01:17:49.430
to organizations who do business
as a multinational.

01:17:49.430 --> 01:17:51.420
So you have various languages
involved.

01:17:51.420 --> 01:17:54.130
So Glass would come in and do
the translation while you're

01:17:54.130 --> 01:17:58.600
talking with someone in
another language.

01:17:58.600 --> 01:18:00.710
Also, it would be a tool
that teaches you the

01:18:00.710 --> 01:18:02.522
language over time.

01:18:02.522 --> 01:18:04.880
So that was the other idea.

01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:06.250
INTERVIEWER: So only
three ideas were

01:18:06.250 --> 01:18:09.160
pitched for Google Glass?

01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:11.460
ALEX PALMER: So we had
a travel idea.

01:18:11.460 --> 01:18:12.640
I don't know if--

01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:13.800
well, I don't know if
I can mention it.

01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:15.860
But there is an Easter
egg in Glass.

01:18:15.860 --> 01:18:17.810
And I don't know if I
can talk about it.

01:18:17.810 --> 01:18:21.430
But essentially, we wanted
a tour app where

01:18:21.430 --> 01:18:23.470
you could walk around.

01:18:23.470 --> 01:18:25.360
And as you walk around, you
look at your Street View.

01:18:25.360 --> 01:18:28.710
And so you've got Street View,
which is a 360 degree picture.

01:18:28.710 --> 01:18:33.300
And as you look up, you see
the different landmarks.

01:18:33.300 --> 01:18:34.560
And then they're also labeled.

01:18:34.560 --> 01:18:38.150
So you can kind of see
the environment

01:18:38.150 --> 01:18:39.090
as your inner person.

01:18:39.090 --> 01:18:41.350
So you could do a tour from a
remote location, or you could

01:18:41.350 --> 01:18:43.640
do a live one.

01:18:43.640 --> 01:18:44.030
INTERVIEWER: All right great.

01:18:44.030 --> 01:18:44.500
Thanks, guys.

01:18:44.500 --> 01:18:45.750
Appreciate it.

01:18:50.980 --> 01:18:51.950
MALE SPEAKER: Sit
down, sit down.

01:18:51.950 --> 01:18:52.790
Come on, everybody.

01:18:52.790 --> 01:18:54.040
Let's go.

01:19:03.250 --> 01:19:06.030
Here's my 30 second pitch.

01:19:06.030 --> 01:19:07.720
A lot of you guys
came from iO.

01:19:07.720 --> 01:19:10.630
I don't know how many of you
know about Startup Weekend.

01:19:10.630 --> 01:19:14.710
But our organization, our goal
is to spread and democratize

01:19:14.710 --> 01:19:18.150
entrepreneurship through events
like Startup Weekend.

01:19:18.150 --> 01:19:19.320
We're a nonprofit.

01:19:19.320 --> 01:19:20.955
We have tons of events all
around the world, whether

01:19:20.955 --> 01:19:24.150
you're from San Francisco,
Chicago, Asia, Europe.

01:19:24.150 --> 01:19:25.530
You name it, we're there.

01:19:25.530 --> 01:19:27.640
If you guys have any interest
attending our events and kind

01:19:27.640 --> 01:19:31.120
of taking an idea like this,
developing it more and turning

01:19:31.120 --> 01:19:33.770
it into some sort of business,
check us out.

01:19:33.770 --> 01:19:35.040
StartupWeekend.org.

01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:36.190
We love Google.

01:19:36.190 --> 01:19:39.390
Why don't we give a round of
applause for Google for

01:19:39.390 --> 01:19:39.950
hosting us here.

01:19:39.950 --> 01:19:41.200
It's a fantastic place.

01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:46.600
Martin, [INAUDIBLE], Stephanie,
thank you guys so

01:19:46.600 --> 01:19:47.460
much for helping us.

01:19:47.460 --> 01:19:49.300
And another round of applause
for our judges.

01:19:49.300 --> 01:19:50.550
Appreciate you guys
coming out here.

01:19:56.470 --> 01:19:58.260
DON DODGE: OK.

01:19:58.260 --> 01:20:00.460
First of all, thank you
all for coming out

01:20:00.460 --> 01:20:01.680
and doing this tonight.

01:20:01.680 --> 01:20:04.790
It's late, and we appreciate
you all being here.

01:20:04.790 --> 01:20:06.830
You did a terrific job.

01:20:06.830 --> 01:20:09.870
One of my other jobs, I'm like
a professional judge.

01:20:09.870 --> 01:20:13.350
So I just startup competitions
probably 10

01:20:13.350 --> 01:20:14.940
to 15 times a year.

01:20:14.940 --> 01:20:18.570
CHRIS DIBONA: He also
does DUI court.

01:20:18.570 --> 01:20:21.500
DON DODGE: And I see over
500 pitches a year,

01:20:21.500 --> 01:20:23.560
500 pitches of startups.

01:20:23.560 --> 01:20:27.210
And some of you here tonight
were better than those guys

01:20:27.210 --> 01:20:29.290
that spend their life
doing this.

01:20:29.290 --> 01:20:32.048
So you guys really
did a nice job.

01:20:35.290 --> 01:20:37.520
To tell you a little bit about
how we do this, we have

01:20:37.520 --> 01:20:38.490
scoring sheets here.

01:20:38.490 --> 01:20:41.920
And we scored each one from one
to five, five being the

01:20:41.920 --> 01:20:44.680
best, over four different
categories.

01:20:44.680 --> 01:20:46.950
I don't know if we told
you about that.

01:20:46.950 --> 01:20:49.300
But anyway, we all put
our numbers down.

01:20:49.300 --> 01:20:50.710
We calculated the results.

01:20:50.710 --> 01:20:52.430
We went into the other room.

01:20:52.430 --> 01:20:57.210
And we said OK, put your top
three companies on the board.

01:20:57.210 --> 01:21:01.040
So all five of us put our top
three companies on the board.

01:21:01.040 --> 01:21:03.460
And that's how we determined
the winner.

01:21:03.460 --> 01:21:08.950
One company, only one company,
showed up on

01:21:08.950 --> 01:21:13.750
all five of our tallies.

01:21:13.750 --> 01:21:16.270
And that company is
SAT with Friends.

01:21:24.660 --> 01:21:27.380
MALE SPEAKER: All right guys,
SAT with Friends, come on up.

01:21:27.380 --> 01:21:28.740
We'll do a picture.

01:21:28.740 --> 01:21:30.310
And you guys get some
cool stuff.

01:21:30.310 --> 01:21:32.910
So you get to hear more
from our lovely

01:21:32.910 --> 01:21:34.020
Don Dodge over here.

01:21:34.020 --> 01:21:35.910
He's going to give you
a coaching session.

01:21:35.910 --> 01:21:40.150
Credits for the Google Cloud
Platform, Google swag, who

01:21:40.150 --> 01:21:43.430
doesn't like Google swag, and
a ticket of your choice to

01:21:43.430 --> 01:21:44.900
either Startup Weekend
or Next, which

01:21:44.900 --> 01:21:46.530
is the other program.

01:21:46.530 --> 01:21:47.730
So let's get a picture.

01:21:47.730 --> 01:21:49.710
You guys, thanks a lot
for coming out.

01:21:49.710 --> 01:21:50.930
