MICHEL DEGRAFF: So why
was I so happy to engage

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.890
in having this course be
ported on OpenCourseWare?

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:14.370
Well, first of all, I
have a very deep affection

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.820
for OpenCourseWare because
I feel that OpenCourseWare

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.630
has this potential to
teach to the billions,

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.260
to share knowledge, to
unlock knowledge for people

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.560
in very far-flung places,
very remote places,

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.880
like in Haiti where there's
little access to quality

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.050
materials.

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.260
So for me, I feel that
OpenCourseWare's mission

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.550
is very germane to myself, as
a Haitian, [INAUDIBLE] MIT,

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.169
wanting to share this wealth
that I have intellectually

00:00:45.169 --> 00:00:46.710
with the rest of
the world, including

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.084
my compatriots in
Haiti who don't

00:00:48.084 --> 00:00:51.930
have that access, that much
access, to quality materials.

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.970
But also, when it comes to
this issue of breaking walls

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:02.310
and building bridges, as we
see, say, in the US and parts

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:07.110
of Europe, the world moving to
more exclusion, to more walls,

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.850
I feel that the
kind of knowledge

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.610
that we're building
here at MIT and how

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.940
we as a people, we as a global
village, as we enrich ourselves

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.830
by understanding other people's
experiences, be it Muslims,

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.880
and immigrants, and blacks, and
Latinos, it is wealth there.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.560
So I feel that it's
important to take

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.166
this knowledge,
these discussions,

00:01:31.166 --> 00:01:32.790
and have it shared
with the whole world

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.450
so people can see that there's
a different way of thinking

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.230
that doesn't involve
building walls for security,

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:43.020
but instead creating dialogues,
building bridges, so that we

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.650
all can be the richer
for it wherever we are,

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:50.160
be it in Boston, Massachusetts,
or in Port-au-Prince Haiti,

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.180
or in Syria, or even Iran.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.490
So that's why I
feel it's important

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.670
that such courses be on
OpenCourseWare for the world

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.612
to participate in.
