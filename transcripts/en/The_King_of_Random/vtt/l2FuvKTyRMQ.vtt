00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.989
Okay, what's up guys today?

00:00:00.989 --> 00:00:03.740
Today I'm out here with my mini metal foundry because we're celebrating a milestone.

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:09.960
The video on melting Pop cans has reached over thirteen and a half million views and over one hundred thousand likes.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.400
Now when I first made the metal foundry

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.160
I had no idea that so many of you would actually be making this

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.420
yourselves and as a result, a lot of you have had questions and concerns and left comments about

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.000
failures and mistakes that have been made and I wanted to update you through this video about some of the personal tips and tricks that

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.039
I started using that may solve those problems for you. The mini metal foundry is made of some very basic materials,

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.319
It's just a steel bucket with a little bit of sand, some plaster of paris and some water to create just enough of an insulating

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.930
layer that you can heat up and melt metals like aluminium, brass and even silver and gold. Okay now some people would like to know

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.860
why did I design the metal foundry out of sand and plaster when I could have used refractory cement,

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.439
kale wool or other higher quality refractory materials like that and the answer is simple, when I designed the metal foundry

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.520
I wanted it to be relatable.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.069
I wanted most people to be able to go out and buy simple commonly available materials and put together a backyard foundry that would work.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:01.680
Now along with that, using cheaper materials means that the system is going to break down a little bit faster. One of the most common

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.019
pieces of feedback I've had from people is that after two or three firings the lid starts to crack and crumble and break and that's

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.409
not just you guys that happens to me as well, but I figured out a cool little trick you can do.

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.769
It'll make it last about 10 times longer and all you need is a little bit of steel wool.

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.740
I went down to the hardware store and found some of the coarsest steel wool

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.059
I could get and when you unravel the bundle you can see it rolls out into long strands of steel

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.450
which is kind of like a metal spiderweb,

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.990
and the idea is to push this down into the plaster and sand mix while it's still wet because this metal mesh will help

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.659
reinforce the sand in the plaster and hold everything together about ten times longer than it would without it. If you want to get even

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.919
more mileage out of your metal foundry then try using stainless steel strands instead of the steel wool.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.180
You can get stainless steel strands in things like Brillo pads which are gonna be a lot more expensive,

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.919
but it should hold up a lot longer in the same kind of conditions. Another one of the benefits of the metal foundry is it's

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.829
very easy to make. Over time the walls will start crumbling,

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.609
but you can just bang all that crud out with a hammer and mix up a new batch, and in 20 minutes

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.409
You've got yourself a brand new system. A bag of plaster and a bag of sand together will cost about $20

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.228
but the cool thing is you can make between two and three metal founders with it.

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.449
Now some people wonder if you can use cement or concrete

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:07.828
instead of plaster of Paris and I would strongly caution you not to. The reason is

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.710
if there's any moisture trapped in the concrete then when it heats up

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.180
there's the potential it could explode in your face. On the other hand plaster of paris and sand are very porous

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.380
so they vent the gasses off

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.549
and there's very very low risk of that happening at all. Now the foundry will reach temperatures up around

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.419
2,000 degrees Fahrenheit, and I know that because of a melt copper and if it can melt copper

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.070
It'll melt silver and gold as well.

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:31.499
But it probably won't melt steel. Steel has a melting point up around 2300 to 2400 degrees Fahrenheit

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.899
so you might be able to use the metal foundry to help you forge steel,

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.280
but you're not going to be able to melt it down and cast with it. Okay let's talk about Crucibles. Now

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.350
I used a fire extinguisher for my crucible and that was mainly just to show that it could be done in an apocalyptic situation.

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.099
I certainly wasn't recommending that a fire extinguisher was the best way to go.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.409
But it's blowing my mind how many comments and questions

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.829
I got from people asking where to get fire extinguishers, or that they bought a fire extinguisher

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.589
only to find out that it melted in the foundry, so let's address that issue first. First of all if your fire extinguisher is melting in

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.479
the foundry, it's NOT made of steel. Remember a magnet will stick to steel, but it won't stick to aluminum

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.770
so if you want to know if your fire extinguisher is made of steel or aluminum, touch a magnet on to the edge and see

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.919
if it sticks. I got my news from an industrial equipment supplier

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.899
but that's not going to be the typical story for you. By Far by Far by Far by far the best crucible I've ever used

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.310
is called a clay graphite crucible, and it's one that I found off the internet for about 30 to 40 dollars, Now

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:21.570
it seems like a little bit of investment,

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:26.309
but trust me a fire extinguisher isn't gonna be any cheaper, and the clay graphite crucible is Gonna last a lot longer.

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.489
I've personally put mine through over 30 different firings

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:33.749
and it has taken a lot of abuse, you see it's vitrified and almost like turned to glass on the edges

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.169
but I put this thing through thermal shock. I heat it up, I cool it down, I heat it up

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.610
I cool it down, I heat it up and cool

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:42.179
It down again, and it just keeps going and going. I even cracked the side of it once

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.680
but it seemed to just heal itself, so a clay graphite crucible is probably what you want to go for and I'll put a link

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.350
in the description to one I found on Amazon that I think would be a good recommendation for you.

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:54.149
Now when it comes to making ingots I've made all kinds of different shapes sizes and styles

00:03:54.150 --> 00:04:00.209
but definitely by far my favourite are the mini metal muffins, these ones are my very favorite because they're extremely easy to store

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:04.799
They're very easy to melt and they'll almost fit any sized crucible, if you make some of the bigger muffins

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.939
you're getting a much bigger crucible to melt them back down, and it's gonna take a lot longer to do now

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:15.119
Let's talk about charcoal, not all charcoals are created equal, the charcoal I used for my first firings was the kingsford charcoal

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.729
Which is used for barbecuing there are ingredients in there like lime

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:21.229
Which is specifically designed to make the coals burn lower temperature?

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:24.289
So they last longer, so if you ever switch over to something like lump charcoal

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:25.380
which is basically just

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:26.180
[pyrolized] wood

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.699
You're gonna find a massive difference in the way it operates.

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.909
The first thing I noticed about lump charcoal is it emits a shower of sparks,

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.309
so you definitely want to make sure you're wearing long sleeves or

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:39.260
you're gonna end up with little sparks burning your arms. The other thing is it burns a lot hotter in the early days

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.659
I had one of my steel fire extinguisher crucibles in there

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.200
And it actually got so hot that it melted the steel and all the aluminum leaked out

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.069
So if you use lump charcoal it will burn a lot hotter, it's very very powerful stuff

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:52.099
But you need to watch it more carefully, use a lower setting on your hairdryer

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.290
You don't need to be pumping that much air into it to get the same temperatures

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:56.010
If you're still using Charcoal to melt your metals

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:01.430
and as soon as you turn the hairdryer off pull the tube out of the metal foundry.

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:05.569
If you leave the tube in the foundry with no air blowing the heats going to travel up that too and melt your hairdryer

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:09.830
And you're gonna end up having to get a new one. Now if you made the switch to the propane conversion congratulations

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:10.940
I hope it's working well for you

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:15.320
But there are some things that you should know like if you run the propane tank for more than about 25 minutes

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:19.159
It's going to start getting really really cold it may start to sound like the gas is running out

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:20.180
But really what's happening

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:25.249
is your propane cylinder is starting to freeze up, a couple of ways you can battle that is to get a big bucket of warm

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:30.080
water and just dump your propane tank down into it to help warm it back up again, or just get a bigger propane tank

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.790
they'll take longer to freeze.

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:34.060
Now I want to talk for a second about styrofoam casting.

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:38.719
I did styrofoam casting in my previous tutorials because I think that's the simplest method to get started in casting

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:43.420
But it doesn't always yield the cleanest results. It's a trial and error sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't.

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:48.770
It blows me away that this concept even works at all that you can just bury styrofoam in sand poured Molten Metal and

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:50.610
Pull out a casting that looks almost identical

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:54.840
But the surface is going to be rough and sometimes the sand collapses and you lose your entire project.

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:58.239
Another thing you need to consider when styrofoam casting is that styrofoam can bend,

00:05:58.239 --> 00:06:00.440
so when you're adding your model to a bucket of sand you need to be very careful about how you add the sand,

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:05.240
because putting too much pressure on it can bend the mold and then

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:09.590
when you cast it it's going to come out looking funny. Now if you want to pull the most value in the most detail from your

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:11.570
Styrofoam castings as possible it does make a difference

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:14.330
what kind of sand you use. Regular play sound will work great

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:18.050
but if you want even more detail you can go to the pet store and get aquarium sand which is

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.430
extremely extremely fine

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:24.200
sand. That'll just be able to get into all the nooks and crannies a lot better and help your casting come out looking really crisp

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:27.650
I worked with very very wet sand all the way to extremely dry sand

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:29.610
And I haven't noticed much of a difference between them

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:34.470
Some people wonder how long should they let their foundry cure before they use it and honestly I don't really think it matters.

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:36.300
I use mine the same day I make it and it seems to work

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:37.050
just fine.

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:40.378
One other disadvantage to styrofoam casting is as you pour, quite often

00:06:40.449 --> 00:06:46.169
sand will fall into that molten mix which will contaminate the purity of your metal so even if you try and buff it up

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:47.610
Sanding it and spend a lot of time

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:52.229
You're gonna know as little specks of sand start to surface through and you'll never be able to get a perfectly smooth finish

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:56.639
Now if you really want to get serious about sand casting rather than using styrofoam which vaporizes

00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:00.300
every time you pour your metal, look into green sand casting instead

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:03.389
It's about 90% sand 5 to 10% clay

00:07:03.389 --> 00:07:05.459
and then just a little bit of moisture to get it to a

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:11.370
consistency where it'll hold together like a sandcastle. The cool thing about green sand casting is you only have to make your model once and

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:12.930
Then you can pack the sand down around it

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:13.430
and then pull your model back out you can reuse your model in your sand over and over and over again

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:21.929
now a lot of people ask me to try casting the foam fighter jets from a previous project, but there is a problem

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:25.079
and that's that the foam is not thick enough for the molten metal to get down inside.

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:30.479
I've noticed with dollar-store foam board your object needs to be about two to three layers thick in order to get the Molten metal into

00:07:30.479 --> 00:07:34.889
all the crevices. If it's less than two thick your chances are very very low that it's going to fill all the gaps

00:07:35.169 --> 00:07:37.829
Now let's talk about spalling. At certain times of the year

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:38.590
there's probably

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:44.549
moisture held within the concrete and if you ever spill your molten metal on the concrete, it can flash that moisture into steam in an

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:45.849
instant and explode

00:07:45.849 --> 00:07:51.449
spalling out bits of concrete all over the place. Now in my experience these chunks of concrete fly up to about 5 feet away which

00:07:51.449 --> 00:07:54.239
doesn't sound like much, but remember it's spewing molten metal at the same time

00:07:54.279 --> 00:07:59.789
so if you're working over concrete be very very careful that you don't spill any molten metal. If you want to be extra cautious then

00:07:59.789 --> 00:08:05.309
do it in an area that's covered in sand. When I was making the mini master sword I failed over and over and over again

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:09.389
Metal casting is an art form it takes a lot of practice. You're not going to get it right on the first try

00:08:09.389 --> 00:08:11.818
It's just a lot of fun to get in there get your hands dirty

00:08:11.819 --> 00:08:15.598
See, what works and see what doesn't play around at the materials that you've got and see what you can create

00:08:15.699 --> 00:08:16.589
So there you have it guys

00:08:16.589 --> 00:08:20.819
I actually am still a really big fan of the mini metal foundry after two years of using it

00:08:20.819 --> 00:08:24.088
I still use that one personally, and I haven't made another system because it gets the job done

00:08:24.089 --> 00:08:27.239
and it works so well and remember that this is an entry level system

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:30.690
If you want to get really serious about backyard casting, I'd strongly recommend looking into

00:08:30.879 --> 00:08:35.039
proper refractory materials. You want to be getting a refractory cement or kale wool.

00:08:35.039 --> 00:08:36.630
It's expensive, but it's really good stuff

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:38.110
and it'll last a lot longer.

00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:42.209
The purpose of this project was to get you thinking outside of the box and seeing that you could do

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:45.570
things on your own, and there are other ways to do it as well my friend Nighthawk and Light

00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:50.429
just dug a hole in the ground and blew some air into it and that was enough to melt aluminum the backyard scientist

00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:55.589
just put out a tutorial for making one of the simplest propane burners I've ever seen also check out the art of weapons

00:08:55.589 --> 00:09:00.089
This is a kid who took refractory brick and made his own electric kiln for melting metals as well

00:09:00.089 --> 00:09:03.958
which is very clean and uses electricity instead of propane or charcoal.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.059
So there you have it guys. There's a few tips and tricks that hopefully will help you and your backyard metal casting experiences

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:13.560
Thanks so much for supporting, sharing and liking these videos that I can keep making them and I'll see you the next video

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:15.740
Talk to you then
