good someone says well I'll tell all ah

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339
good someone says well I'll tell all ah
 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.950
good someone says well I'll tell all ah
go for that let's see

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:08.960
go for that let's see
 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.959
go for that let's see
hi Jordan what are feelings and why do

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969
hi Jordan what are feelings and why do
 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.039
hi Jordan what are feelings and why do
we have them well here's a way of

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049
we have them well here's a way of
 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.790
we have them well here's a way of
thinking about it so look let's say you

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800
thinking about it so look let's say you
 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.170
thinking about it so look let's say you
were walking down the pathway I actually

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180
were walking down the pathway I actually
 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.910
were walking down the pathway I actually
saw this happen one day so I'll tell you

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920
saw this happen one day so I'll tell you
 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.410
saw this happen one day so I'll tell you
this story so I was walking along the

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420
this story so I was walking along the
 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.800
this story so I was walking along the
cliffs near I think it was San Diego

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810
cliffs near I think it was San Diego
 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.669
cliffs near I think it was San Diego
where la I don't remember I think it's

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679
where la I don't remember I think it's
 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.770
where la I don't remember I think it's
probably I think it was it I think it

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780
probably I think it was it I think it
 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.020
probably I think it was it I think it
was San Diego anyways I was walking

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030
was San Diego anyways I was walking
 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.810
was San Diego anyways I was walking
along there with some friends and and a

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820
along there with some friends and and a
 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.040
along there with some friends and and a
brother of a friend of mine who was

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050
brother of a friend of mine who was
 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.080
brother of a friend of mine who was
quite a tall guy is about six foot five

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090
quite a tall guy is about six foot five
 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.670
quite a tall guy is about six foot five
something like that and he was walking

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680
something like that and he was walking
 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.410
something like that and he was walking
along the path on the edge of the cliff

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420
along the path on the edge of the cliff
 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.290
along the path on the edge of the cliff
kind of sandy and with with scrub pine

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300
kind of sandy and with with scrub pine
 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.930
kind of sandy and with with scrub pine
around overlooking the Pacific Ocean and

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940
around overlooking the Pacific Ocean and
 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.959
around overlooking the Pacific Ocean and
it was March I think so was warm but not

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969
it was March I think so was warm but not
 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.330
it was March I think so was warm but not
too warm we were walking along and all

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340
too warm we were walking along and all
 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.760
too warm we were walking along and all
of a sudden his little girl who I think

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770
of a sudden his little girl who I think
 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.209
of a sudden his little girl who I think
was like four or five I saw she was

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219
was like four or five I saw she was
 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.979
was like four or five I saw she was
walking in front of him and in front of

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989
walking in front of him and in front of
 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.780
walking in front of him and in front of
me and I guess we were going around a

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790
me and I guess we were going around a
 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:06.950
me and I guess we were going around a
little bit of a corner and all of a

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960
little bit of a corner and all of a
 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.109
little bit of a corner and all of a
sudden she jumped right up on his

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119
sudden she jumped right up on his
 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.630
sudden she jumped right up on his
shoulders which I'd never seen a child

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640
shoulders which I'd never seen a child
 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.310
shoulders which I'd never seen a child
do that it was like watching you know if

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320
do that it was like watching you know if
 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.679
do that it was like watching you know if
you if a cat's sleep in you and you and

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689
you if a cat's sleep in you and you and
 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.890
you if a cat's sleep in you and you and
you go at it it'll like jump up and puff

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900
you go at it it'll like jump up and puff
 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.109
you go at it it'll like jump up and puff
out its hair and can jump straight up

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119
out its hair and can jump straight up
 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.030
out its hair and can jump straight up
well that's what this kid did and there

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040
well that's what this kid did and there
 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.190
well that's what this kid did and there
was a rattlesnake at the side of the of

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200
was a rattlesnake at the side of the of
 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.890
was a rattlesnake at the side of the of
the path now it was cold which was

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900
the path now it was cold which was
 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.890
the path now it was cold which was
probably good but you know there's a guy

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900
probably good but you know there's a guy
 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.399
probably good but you know there's a guy
named uh-oh

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409
 
 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.499
 
oh I carry who wrote a great book on

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509
oh I carry who wrote a great book on
 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.899
oh I carry who wrote a great book on
fear it'll come to me it'll come to me

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909
fear it'll come to me it'll come to me
 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.069
fear it'll come to me it'll come to me
it's a book that I should have on my

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079
it's a book that I should have on my
 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.569
it's a book that I should have on my
book list actually and he showed that

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:43.579
book list actually and he showed that
 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:47.600
book list actually and he showed that
there are circuits in your brain there

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610
there are circuits in your brain there
 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.069
there are circuits in your brain there
reflex circuits so this had been

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079
reflex circuits so this had been
 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.749
reflex circuits so this had been
demonstrated to some degree much earlier

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759
demonstrated to some degree much earlier
 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.719
demonstrated to some degree much earlier
that map so imagine that a snake is a

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729
that map so imagine that a snake is a
 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.639
that map so imagine that a snake is a
pattern and then imagine that there's a

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649
pattern and then imagine that there's a
 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.649
pattern and then imagine that there's a
pattern on your retina that constitutes

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659
pattern on your retina that constitutes
 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.899
pattern on your retina that constitutes
the snake and then imagine that that can

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909
the snake and then imagine that that can
 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.819
the snake and then imagine that that can
be transformed into another pattern

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829
be transformed into another pattern
 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.069
be transformed into another pattern
which is a muscular output pattern and

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079
which is a muscular output pattern and
 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.740
which is a muscular output pattern and
that muscular output pattern is to jump

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750
that muscular output pattern is to jump
 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.479
that muscular output pattern is to jump
you in the air so your eyes make your

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:10.489
you in the air so your eyes make your
 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:13.430
you in the air so your eyes make your
your make your muscles move in a

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440
your make your muscles move in a
 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.050
your make your muscles move in a
ticular way in and that happens before

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060
ticular way in and that happens before
 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.150
ticular way in and that happens before
you see the snake and before you're

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160
you see the snake and before you're
 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.370
you see the snake and before you're
afraid and the reason for that is that

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380
afraid and the reason for that is that
 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.170
afraid and the reason for that is that
so it's there are not many neural

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180
so it's there are not many neural
 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.240
so it's there are not many neural
connections between snake detection and

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250
connections between snake detection and
 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.210
connections between snake detection and
leaping in the air and that's because if

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220
leaping in the air and that's because if
 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.820
leaping in the air and that's because if
you waited to feel fear and waited to

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830
you waited to feel fear and waited to
 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.920
you waited to feel fear and waited to
see the snake that would take between a

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930
see the snake that would take between a
 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.290
see the snake that would take between a
quarter and half a second something like

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300
quarter and half a second something like
 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.360
quarter and half a second something like
that and the snake would have already

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370
that and the snake would have already
 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.010
that and the snake would have already
bitten you so unless you had those

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020
bitten you so unless you had those
 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.810
bitten you so unless you had those
really short neural pathways that have

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820
really short neural pathways that have
 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.270
really short neural pathways that have
been conserved in the evolutionary

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280
been conserved in the evolutionary
 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.450
been conserved in the evolutionary
process since like the beginning of time

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:43.460
process since like the beginning of time
 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:46.400
process since like the beginning of time
anything super fast and simple would be

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410
anything super fast and simple would be
 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.300
anything super fast and simple would be
able to kill you so now so let's say

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310
able to kill you so now so let's say
 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:51.650
able to kill you so now so let's say
that you do encounter something

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660
that you do encounter something
 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.380
that you do encounter something
unexpected well first you have these

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390
unexpected well first you have these
 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.570
unexpected well first you have these
bodily reflexes that are really fast and

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580
bodily reflexes that are really fast and
 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:57.920
bodily reflexes that are really fast and
then the next thing that happens

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930
then the next thing that happens
 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.570
then the next thing that happens
generally speaking is that you feel an

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580
generally speaking is that you feel an
 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.000
generally speaking is that you feel an
emotion like maybe you're frozen so if

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010
emotion like maybe you're frozen so if
 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.250
emotion like maybe you're frozen so if
you hear a real growl behind you you'll

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260
you hear a real growl behind you you'll
 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.780
you hear a real growl behind you you'll
freeze and then you'll feel fear and

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790
freeze and then you'll feel fear and
 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.170
freeze and then you'll feel fear and
that'll keep you frozen and so the the

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180
that'll keep you frozen and so the the
 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.780
that'll keep you frozen and so the the
fear is a an indication of that

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790
fear is a an indication of that
 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.780
fear is a an indication of that
physiological state and then only after

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790
physiological state and then only after
 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.460
physiological state and then only after
that will you start to think and

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470
that will you start to think and
 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.240
that will you start to think and
strategize and so you need reactions at

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250
strategize and so you need reactions at
 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.729
strategize and so you need reactions at
multiple levels of temporal resolution

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739
multiple levels of temporal resolution
 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:24.440
multiple levels of temporal resolution
in order to keep you safe in the world

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450
in order to keep you safe in the world
 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.540
in order to keep you safe in the world
and the fast reactions are muscular and

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550
and the fast reactions are muscular and
 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.070
and the fast reactions are muscular and
reflexive and then the next ones

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080
reflexive and then the next ones
 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.690
reflexive and then the next ones
generally speaking or something like

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700
generally speaking or something like
 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.240
generally speaking or something like
emotions and they're low resolution but

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250
emotions and they're low resolution but
 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.550
emotions and they're low resolution but
quick you know like if you're afraid it

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560
quick you know like if you're afraid it
 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.199
quick you know like if you're afraid it
means there's something that may be

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209
means there's something that may be
 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:39.140
