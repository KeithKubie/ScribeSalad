JAREK WILKIEWICZ:
As an app developer,

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:05.170
you may sometimes forget that
building the app is only half

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:06.200
of the battle.

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.160
The other half is
driving installs

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.090
and making sure your
users keep coming back.

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:13.290
But how do we go
about doing this?

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.510
Can engagement and user growth
be designed and implemented

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:19.110
much like any other component
of your application?

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:21.980
The answer is yes it can
with the technology Google

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.680
uses to power its own apps.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.530
Let's look at an example.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.310
A few years ago, my wife and I
went for a vacation to Spain.

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.160
We had a wonderful time, but
what I remember most vividly

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.070
is an amazing paella we
had in the city of Malaga.

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.760
So today, I would love it
if Google could help me

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.020
cook a paella just like that.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.120
Now suppose you,
the developer, build

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.780
an app that, in fact,
contains the recipe

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.030
for an authentic Malaga paella.

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.870
When I'm searching
on Google, your app

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:51.980
is presented as one
of the search results

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:53.810
so I can install it right away.

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.350
Or, if I already have
the app installed,

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.510
Google Search takes me directly
to the recipe in your app

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.010
using a deep link.

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.900
That's right.

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.930
With app indexing,
Google can help

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.310
users discover content
inside of your app

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.280
and bring users wanting
to make that tasty

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.720
paella direct into your app.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.410
After finding the recipe, it
is time for the recipe app

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:14.800
to walk me through the steps.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.750
Since my hands are
occupied making the paella,

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.240
I can say, OK, Google,
and use voice actions

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.250
to invoke the recipe up.

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.400
With voice actions, you
can take the advantage

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.890
of Google's speech recognition
and natural language

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.270
understanding technology without
having to write a ton of code.

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.270
As you saw from our
cooking example,

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.460
you can go beyond
traditional web search

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.780
by using app indexing
and voice actions

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.470
to provide new engagement
opportunities for your app

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.280
and offering new
experiences for your users.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.610
Whether you are building
an app for cooking, travel,

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.650
or any other cool new use
case, follow these two steps

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.400
to integrate with Google Search.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.250
First, set up your deep
links so that the Google

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.130
bot can crawl them much
like it crawls websites.

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:55.270
What are deep links?

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:56.900
Think about them as
a way to identify

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.460
a specific piece of content
or functionality inside

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:01.960
of your mobile application.

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.500
Much like web
URLs, but for apps.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.120
When your app
supports deep linking,

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.460
you can get into the Google
index by using app indexing.

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.300
Once your app is in
the Google index,

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.230
the second step is
to annotate your app

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.180
to describe what it can do.

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.850
For example, you can
integrate Google Voice actions

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.370
to expose app capabilities that
users can activate with Voice.

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.000
Let Google understand your apps
usage with app indexing API

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.100
to enable re-engagement
from the Google app

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.680
through auto completion.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.260
Finally, for some use cases such
as travel and entertainment,

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.630
your email reminder can appear
as a Google Now card providing

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.070
the user with rich information
that takes them back

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.020
to your email where they
can return to your site.

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.120
By integrating
with Google Search,

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.460
you can increase app
installs, drive engagement

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.490
through deep links in
Google Search results,

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:51.770
and engage users in cool
new ways with Voice actions.

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:53.950
If you enjoyed the
paella story, may I

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.610
recommend some great
sample code for dessert?

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.475
