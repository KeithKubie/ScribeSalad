 Eric Fromling: With you Eric Fromling, 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:12.330
 I work as a developer of what is known as independent games and has been able to manufacture 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.060
 The whole game itself is called BombSquad. 

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:16.410
 I started writing BombSquad out of sheer hobby and during that 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.894
 I graduated from the Institute of Arts. 

00:00:17.894 --> 00:00:20.060
 I was writing it just for fun with my friends 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.560
 During our meetings to spend a pleasant time. 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.759
 I adore model innovation, 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:26.800
 Therefore all the contents of the game, whether characters or scenes, 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.610
 Previously set up in reality, then added 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.700
 To the game, giving this game a unique character. 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.660
 For years it has been a hobby. 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.220
 But a few years ago, I decided to start 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.490
 So I see what I can do. 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:40.610
 Now I am earning my living from this. 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.200
 Before Player Analytics appeared, I was feeling the way 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.390
 Like the blind and guess what the players are doing on my game, 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.940
 I guess the reason for their spending a long time 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.606
 And in anything that spends their time on the game, 

00:00:48.606 --> 00:00:49.648
 But without my will. 

00:00:49.648 --> 00:00:52.022
 But when I started using this tool, I started to see my way 

00:00:52.022 --> 00:00:52.559
 In the best way. 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.350
 I suddenly discovered a low level of fruit, 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.010
 Where I can improve the retention or improvement of the player 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.680
 Income from the game. 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.840
 BombSquad is essentially a multiplayer game, but 90% 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.810
 Those who play would prefer the style of individual play. 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:05.590
 This helped me a lot in focusing my efforts 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.800
 And add more content and activities to them 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.096
 Players in this mode of the game. 

00:01:10.096 --> 00:01:11.720
 I knew from Player Analytics that players are investigating 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.470
 Earning more than spending in the game, 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.250
 So I was able to rebalance my economic calculations 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.515
 And the introduction of a significant positive change on my earnings. 

00:01:17.515 --> 00:01:21.630
 This in turn earned me 140% of the profit rate per user, 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.609
 In addition to 67% of the profit rate per user paying a fee. 

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:27.400
 When you look at the player progress chart, 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.670
 I also discovered that players are having difficulty in 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.490
 Skip the second or third level of the game. 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:32.580
 The degree of difficulty was great. 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.470
 So I checked it out to make a balance. 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.540
 You've added an easy situation. 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.725
 After that, I saw an increase of 3.6 times the number 

00:01:38.725 --> 00:01:40.350
 Levels completed by players, 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.066
 Which helped to increase the retention rate of players. 

00:01:43.066 --> 00:01:44.940
 The presentation tool is important in many ways. 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.690
 From a face that I use as a tool to test efficiency. 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:48.660
 After you've submitted the game, I can see the Event Viewer to make sure 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.640
 Of that users' frames are still good every second, 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.720
 And that everything is going well in the game. 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.678
 There is something else I have learned from the event viewer 

00:01:54.678 --> 00:01:56.280
 I use very long training materials. 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.250
 Where he was skipped by many after about 10 seconds. 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.519
 You have benefited greatly from Player Analytics 

00:02:01.519 --> 00:02:03.810
 What made me distinguish between right and wrong in what I do, 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.910
 And then managed to adjust the compass 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:07.970
 Making it financially profitable. 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.750
 The most important advice to developers 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.330
 To put content, 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.260
 And explore the places of error and watch the numbers, 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.150
 Using tools like Player Analytics. 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.670
 You can then correct the errors and try again. 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.128
 I also recommend the importance of perseverance to achieve the goals in the end. 

00:02:19.128 --> 00:02:22.060
