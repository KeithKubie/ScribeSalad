00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:02.350
We've seen that an
investment bank can

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:04.860
buy a bunch of mortgages,
which essentially makes them

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:06.840
the lender to the
homeowners, and then it

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.690
could stick those mortgages
inside of a special purpose

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:10.365
entity.

00:00:10.365 --> 00:00:12.740
And then it could sell the
shares in that special purpose

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:14.198
entity, and that
these shares would

00:00:14.198 --> 00:00:16.170
be called mortgage-backed
securities.

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.253
And let's just say, just
for the sake of argument,

00:00:18.253 --> 00:00:23.360
when it sells these shares
it sells them at $10 a share,

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.580
and it promises
dividends at $10 a share,

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.080
the equivalent of an 8% yield.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.240
So maybe the homeowners
here are paying

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.060
a higher than 8%
interest, some of them

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:37.872
default, once you
average everything out,

00:00:37.872 --> 00:00:40.080
and the investment bank
keeps a little bit for itself

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.100
and to do all the operations
and all the overhead,

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.450
and so it can actually give
the investors an 8% yield.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:48.710
This might be good for a
whole class of investors.

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.795
They might like the safety
profile, the risk profile

00:00:51.795 --> 00:00:54.420
of the special purpose entity of
this mortgage-backed security,

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.420
and they might like the return,
and they might go for it.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.660
But there might be a
class of investors,

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.560
may be very risk-averse
investors like pensions,

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.820
that says that this
mortgage-backed security is

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:08.619
too risky.

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:10.160
They've looked at
what we're holding,

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.743
and they are like, hey, some of
these are sub-prime mortgages,

00:01:12.743 --> 00:01:15.330
some of these are shady, some
of these are to risky borrowers.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.780
I don't like where
this is going.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.530
And even if they can't
look under the hood

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.610
to see what this is,
the investment bank

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.700
might have hired
a ratings agency.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:29.630
So maybe a ratings agency to
essentially look under the hood

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.340
and tell investors what's there.

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.980
So the ratings agency might look
at this special purpose entity

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:36.521
and look at these
securities and say,

00:01:36.521 --> 00:01:42.140
look, I would say that these
securities should be rated BB.

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.640
So not super safe, but
not super risky either,

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.670
but for pensions that
is not safe enough.

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.760
Now on the other hand, you might
have people who want more risk.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.300
So you might have, maybe
there's some risky hedge funds,

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:55.940
and not all hedge
funds are risky,

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.106
but let's say that there
are some risky hedge funds,

00:01:58.106 --> 00:02:00.000
and then they say that
this yield is too low.

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.220
And the investment
bankers, they're

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.840
very creative people,
they say, well, look,

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.100
here's some people who
want to buy securities,

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.515
but these securities
are too risky for them.

00:02:12.515 --> 00:02:13.890
And there's other
people who want

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.330
to buy securities who are
able to take on more risk,

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.730
but they say the
yield is too low.

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.830
So instead of losing
out on these investors,

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.150
why don't I just split
up this special purpose

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:24.750
entity in a different way?

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.780
Why don't I split
it up into tranches?

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.670
So instead of all of the
securities being the same,

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.160
why don't I put
them into classes?

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.900
And they're often called
the senior tranche,

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.400
the mezzanine tranche,
I'll just write "Mez"

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.186
for short or the middle tranche,
and then the equity tranche.

00:02:47.186 --> 00:02:49.310
And the way it works, in
a mortgage-backed security

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.470
everyone gets paid
the same amount.

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.890
In this situation, when
you split it this way,

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.110
the holders of the
senior tranche securities

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:58.910
are going to get paid first.

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.650
Only when they
are made whole are

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.620
the owners of the
mezzanine tranche security

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.200
is going to get paid, and only
when they are made whole will

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.770
the owners of the equity
tranche security will get paid.

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.460
And this scenario
right over here

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:17.300
is called a collateralized
debt obligation, CDO.

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.800
And it's really a derivative
security from the mortgages.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.855
We've sliced it and diced it
in a slightly different way.

00:03:23.855 --> 00:03:26.230
Now you might be saying, how
does this solve the problem?

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.160
Well, now the ratings
agency will say,

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.618
well, look if the
senior people are

00:03:29.618 --> 00:03:31.300
going to get paid
before everyone else,

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.133
then I'm going to give
them a higher rating.

00:03:33.133 --> 00:03:35.960
And they can even get insurance
on this and get a credit

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.190
default swap, and then maybe
they'll give it a AAA rating,

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.390
and which means that the
pensions can now buy the senior

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.932
rated CDO's.

00:03:44.932 --> 00:03:46.390
But they'll pay
them less interest.

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.110
Maybe they'll pay them 5%.

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.240
Maybe the mezzanine,
they get paid next,

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.920
they'll get maybe still a BB
rating, and they'll get the 8%.

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.350
And then the equity tranche,
they'll get a higher interest.

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:01.890
So they'll get say a
15% interest in exchange

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.690
for being the last
person to get paid.

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:06.600
And maybe they don't
get any ratings at all.

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.360
So you could almost view
this as a junk rating

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:09.693
if you want to view it that way.

00:04:09.693 --> 00:04:11.230
But that makes
both people happy.

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:14.050
Pensions get something
safe, lower yield.

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:18.720
Hedge funds get something risky,
but it has a higher yield.
