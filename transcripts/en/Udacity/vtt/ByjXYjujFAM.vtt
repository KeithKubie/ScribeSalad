00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Since HTML is structured,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.000
we're going to want to break it up into words and punctuation and word-like elements,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and we use the special term token to mean all of those.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
In general, a token can refer to a word, a string,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
numbers, punctuation.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
It's the smallest unit of the output of a lexical analysis.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Remember, that's what we're currently working on.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Mostly tokens do not refer to white space,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
which is just a formal way of referring to the spaces between words.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
We're going to be focusing on lexical analysis,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
a process whereby we break down a string, like a sentence

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
or an utterance or a webpage, into a list of tokens.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
One string might contain many tokens

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
in the same way that one sentence might contain many words.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Here I've written 6 HTML tokens,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
given them names on the left and examples on the right.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Now, the naming of tokens is a bit arbitrary.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
In general, though, tokens are given uppercase names

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
to help us tell them apart from other words or variables.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Here this left angle corresponds to an angle bracket

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
facing left presumably--not quite sure how to draw that.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
The smaller end is to face.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Left angle slash is a &lt; followed by a /, division sign.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
The right angle bracket, &gt; facing to the right.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Here's the angle. Here's the face.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
The equal sign is just =.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
A string is going to have double quotes around it,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.000
and a word is anything else, welcome to my webpage, punctuation like that.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Now, it turns out that the naming of tokens is not quite an arbitrary matter.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
You may think I'm as mad as a hatter.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
No, that's a different story.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
We're just going to go with these token names for now,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
but if you were designing a system from the ground up,

00:02:09.000 --> 09:59:59.000
you can rename them to be anything you like.
