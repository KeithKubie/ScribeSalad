00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.340
This one’s real easy, you guys--super low
key, not really a big deal, it’s just this

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:09.860
silly question that nobody’s really interested
in, it’s just like….how did life begin?

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:11.730
Ok, obviously I’m joking.

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.730
This is one of the biggest unanswered questions
in science today, and is the backbone of our

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:21.599
burning questions about who we are, where
we come from, and if we’re alone out here.

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:26.899
New research has now given us clues into how
exactly the fundamental molecular building

00:00:26.899 --> 00:00:30.130
blocks of life came together in the first
place.

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.810
Because that’s the central question: in
the big puddly soup of pre-biotic earth--as

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:40.390
in, earth before living organisms--how did
the perfect ingredients for life form, much

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.620
less fuse together into something that stores
information and can replicate independently.

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:52.220
A primer on how our living cell’s work:
A cell’s most important components are DNA,

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.540
RNA and a ribosome.

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.010
DNA codes for all of the essential information
about what the organism is and how it works,

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.989
but it’s kept all safe and huddled away
in the nucleus.

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.340
To take that information and make it into
actual stuff, like proteins, an enzyme called

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.990
RNA polymerase copies sections of the DNA
and makes strands of RNA, which are a like

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.560
one-sided version of DNA.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.469
These messenger RNA strands get sent to the
cell’s ribosome, where they’re converted

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:20.389
into the proteins our cells need for survival.

00:01:20.389 --> 00:01:24.259
When scientists were first discovering all
this complex stuff, it became an even bigger

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:29.539
question of how all this could have spontaneously
come together as a result of organic chemistry.

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:35.299
To tackle this problem, some scientists suggested
that perhaps life as we know it now didn’t

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:39.509
all spontaneously form at once exactly as
it is, it was probably a little simpler...maybe

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.950
it was only RNA-based!

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.259
This hypothetical situation is what we refer
to as the RNA world.

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:51.560
But this track of thinking is based on the
idea that the self-replicating aspect of life

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.229
is what formed first.

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:55.820
And not everyone agrees.

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:02.490
Some people think that metabolization, or
the ability to extract energy from your environment,

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.799
must have come first, while a third camp thinks
that compartmentalisation must have come first,

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.380
a primitive version of the different internal
pieces of a cell.

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.040
These divisions in the scientific community
still survive, but as we’ve come to learn

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.390
more about RNA and how it can behave, it’s
become clearer that it’s an essential part

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.710
of the beginning of life, if not the first
thing that formed.

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.500
This is because RNA can do a really exciting
thing.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.850
Not only can it contain information that it
can then replicate...but it can also fold

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:37.620
itself up into shapes in which it can act
as an catalyst, influencing chemical reactions!

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.130
When this was discovered, we realized it was
much more likely that RNA-based life could

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:47.040
indeed have survived and replicated all on
its own...without the all the fancy add-ons

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.130
we have today.

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:54.050
So then we come down to the question again--how
did RNA form in the first place?

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.150
Scientists have been on a quest to demonstrate
how all of RNA’s component parts could have

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.490
spontaneously assembled, and new research
may just bring it all together.

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:07.360
RNA is made up of the nucleic acids cytosine,
uracil, adenine, and guanine.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.480
A research team had shown a few years ago
that a set of five simple compounds could

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.850
have given rise to cytosine and uracil with
nothing more than the addition of UV light,

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.040
which there was plenty of on a primitive earth.

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:25.820
A different team then showed a similarly easy
and plausible process for the formation of

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.900
adenine and guanine from simple building block
elements.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:34.710
But no one had demonstrated that these two
separate reactions, producing all four RNA

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:41.130
nucleic acids, could have occurred in the
same place at the same time...until now.

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.810
A paper that came out in 2018 showed that
a simple set of molecules--oxygen, nitrogen,

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:51.110
methane, ammonia, water, and hydrogen cyanide,
all of which would have been present on an

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:56.870
early version of earth--could react to form
what we recognize as the uracil, adenine,

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:58.200
guanine and cytosine.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:03.670
This work is the first experimental evidence
showing that the chemistry fits--these building

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.140
blocks could have feasibly all come together
at the same time, in the same place, we saw

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.170
it happen before our very eyes.

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.810
There are still a couple of missing pieces
that we haven’t been able to recreate in

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:14.810
the lab.

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.150
For instance, how did each of the building
blocks come together to link them into the

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.870
long chains that take them from nucleic acids
to actual RNA?

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:25.870
And, keep in mind, while the RNA world is
the leading theory, there is some contention

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.870
among scientists about the first inklings
of life on earth.

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.930
Hopefully work like this will add to that
discussion, PLUS it does represent an unprecedented

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.889
step forward in answering the most fundamental
of questions: how life began.
