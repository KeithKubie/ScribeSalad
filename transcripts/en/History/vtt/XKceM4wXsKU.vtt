00:00:03.294 --> 00:00:06.381
NARRATOR: Rick and Charles,
along with Craig Tester

00:00:06.381 --> 00:00:10.260
and Dave Blankenship, head
over to the Money Pit site,

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.220
where the team from
Choice Drilling

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:18.560
has already begun coring a
new borehole known as IJ 5.5,

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.354
an area chosen due to
its close proximity

00:00:21.354 --> 00:00:26.818
to GAL-1, one of the team's
most promising shafts to date.

00:00:26.818 --> 00:00:27.485
Hey, guys.

00:00:27.485 --> 00:00:29.028
Hey.

00:00:29.028 --> 00:00:30.530
RICK LAGINA: I am absolutely
interested in drilling

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:33.742
this position called
IJ 5.5 in search

00:00:33.742 --> 00:00:36.244
of the long sought after
tunnel between shaft

00:00:36.244 --> 00:00:37.954
6 and the Money Pit.

00:00:37.954 --> 00:00:41.583
After that collapse in 1861,
the Money Pit location was lost.

00:00:41.583 --> 00:00:44.294
And ever since then,
there's only been a guess,

00:00:44.294 --> 00:00:45.879
an educated guess, mind you.

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:48.089
But if we can find that
tunnel, I think that's the way

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:50.842
to un-corkscrew the Money Pit.

00:00:50.842 --> 00:00:52.427
So Brennan,
we're at 59, right?

00:00:52.427 --> 00:00:54.095
That's correct, 59.

00:00:54.095 --> 00:00:56.306
The reason why this
one is interesting--

00:00:56.306 --> 00:01:01.561
when we drilled the GAL hole,
we found in the spoils--

00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:04.564
they find a very old spike.

00:01:04.564 --> 00:01:05.899
And we found a
gold-plated button.

00:01:09.027 --> 00:01:10.320
That's our spot right there.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.072
That's where GAL
is, GAL number one.

00:01:13.072 --> 00:01:16.159
NARRATOR: Two years ago, in an
effort to locate the original

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:20.413
Money Pit, the Oak Island
team excavated a 40-inch-wide

00:01:20.413 --> 00:01:22.874
exploratory shaft
which was named

00:01:22.874 --> 00:01:25.043
in honor of Rick
and Marty's parents,

00:01:25.043 --> 00:01:27.212
George and Ann Lagina--

00:01:27.212 --> 00:01:29.964
GAL-1.

00:01:29.964 --> 00:01:31.674
We've got coin!

00:01:31.674 --> 00:01:34.344
Honest to God, a coin
out of this spoils?

00:01:34.344 --> 00:01:37.180
NARRATOR: It was while searching
the spoils from this hole,

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.725
which was done to a
depth of 160 feet,

00:01:40.725 --> 00:01:43.853
that the team made a number
of significant discoveries--

00:01:43.853 --> 00:01:45.897
It says play,
and it's a button.

00:01:45.897 --> 00:01:48.358
NARRATOR: --including a
gold plated 18th century

00:01:48.358 --> 00:01:52.362
British military button,
a 300-year-old iron

00:01:52.362 --> 00:01:55.156
rose head spike, and
a mysterious metal

00:01:55.156 --> 00:01:57.826
hinge believed to have
come from some kind

00:01:57.826 --> 00:02:02.288
of large box or vault.

00:02:02.288 --> 00:02:05.416
Maybe that was part
of the debris field.

00:02:05.416 --> 00:02:07.001
I'd never thought
twice about it.

00:02:07.001 --> 00:02:08.419
Did you?

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:09.504
No, because we didn't
know where it came from.

00:02:09.504 --> 00:02:10.338
Oh, OK.

00:02:15.343 --> 00:02:17.804
Maybe today we'll
find the one thing.

00:02:17.804 --> 00:02:18.471
Yeah.

00:02:18.471 --> 00:02:21.057
Yeah.

00:02:21.057 --> 00:02:23.518
That's the hope.

00:02:23.518 --> 00:02:25.812
NARRATOR: If their
assumption is correct,

00:02:25.812 --> 00:02:28.481
the team should be
able to locate not only

00:02:28.481 --> 00:02:31.025
the original Money
Pit, but also what

00:02:31.025 --> 00:02:34.988
they hope is a massive
underground debris field.

00:02:34.988 --> 00:02:35.947
How are you doing?

00:02:35.947 --> 00:02:37.323
How deep are we?

00:02:37.323 --> 00:02:38.074
We're down about--

00:02:38.074 --> 00:02:39.075
89 feet.

00:02:39.075 --> 00:02:40.618
89 feet.

00:02:40.618 --> 00:02:41.161
Close.

00:02:46.749 --> 00:02:48.084
Well, here we go.

00:02:58.136 --> 00:02:59.137
111 [inaudible].

00:02:59.137 --> 00:02:59.721
111.

00:03:04.851 --> 00:03:06.269
Yeah, it does.

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:07.770
Oh, that's interesting.

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.147
What do you got?

00:03:09.147 --> 00:03:12.775
NARRATOR: While drilling
in borehole IJ 5.5,

00:03:12.775 --> 00:03:15.778
Rick Lagina and members
of the Oak Island team

00:03:15.778 --> 00:03:19.449
have just made a potentially
significant find.

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:20.950
Was that horizontal, Rick?

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.285
Yeah,

00:03:22.285 --> 00:03:27.415
I think he hit the
tunnel from shaft 6.

00:03:27.415 --> 00:03:29.375
NARRATOR: They have just
discovered evidence of what

00:03:29.375 --> 00:03:34.589
appears to be a wooden beam
found at a depth of 111

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:38.509
feet, a depth which, according
to historical records,

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:43.765
matches that of shaft 6,
the 157-year-old searcher

00:03:43.765 --> 00:03:45.850
tunnel that they
believe can lead

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.896
them directly to the original
Oak Island Money Pit.

00:03:49.896 --> 00:03:51.981
RICK LAGINA: Today was a
good day on Oak Island,

00:03:51.981 --> 00:03:53.191
in my opinion.

00:03:53.191 --> 00:03:54.817
They do believe
we're in a tunnel.

00:03:54.817 --> 00:03:59.572
And if we are, it's been
hard won, hard fought.

00:03:59.572 --> 00:04:02.909
He's been looking for this
debris field since we started.

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:05.328
So it moves the
dial a little bit.

00:04:05.328 --> 00:04:08.164
You find that tunnel,
you'll find the Money Pit.

00:04:08.164 --> 00:04:11.584
I really believe this is
the tunnel from shaft 6.

00:04:11.584 --> 00:04:13.336
Now, it's just finding
out did the treasure

00:04:13.336 --> 00:04:15.380
chests shoot into this tunnel.

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:16.255
Yep.

00:04:16.255 --> 00:04:17.882
There's something in 6.

00:04:17.882 --> 00:04:19.008
- Let's find it.
- OK.

00:04:19.008 --> 00:04:19.717
OK, gentlemen.

00:04:19.717 --> 00:04:20.718
Thank you.
