00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.609
The School of Life has always felt very close
to the German language in general - and to

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:07.149
Switzerland in particular.

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:12.360
That’s why we’re so pleased to announce
that we are at last coming to Zurich, with

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.980
a big 3 day conference that we’re going
to be running starting on Friday, 12th of

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.300
October, 2018.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:25.720
Taking place in Zurich’s university of the
arts, this is a three day event about everything

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.820
we care about at the School of Life: emotional
intelligence, wisdom, self-understanding,

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.510
love, friendship and meaning.

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.190
The conference will mirror what happened in
our conferences in Lisbon Portugal in October

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:46.809
2017 and San Francisco, USA in March 2018.
That means we’ll have lectures in the day,

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:52.769
great meals together, the best kinds of interactions,
and chats about everything that matters late

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:59.050
into the night. It’ll be a true chance to
experience a globally-minded community dedicated

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.760
to learning, kindness, self-exploration and
wisdom.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:09.440
The conference lasts three days and is led
by our founder and creative lead, Alain de

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:15.270
Botton - and will feature our best teachers,
and our very best, and most transformative

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.890
ideas.

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.590

You’ll learn a lot - return with a huge
number of useful new ideas and make friends

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.020
for life.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.310
We hope to see you there.
