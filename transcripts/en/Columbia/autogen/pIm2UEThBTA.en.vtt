00:17:58.310 --> 00:18:00.890
now when you think about this in terms

00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:00.900
now when you think about this in terms
 

00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:04.550
now when you think about this in terms
of what was going on around fountain

00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:04.560
of what was going on around fountain
 

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:07.760
of what was going on around fountain
house during this period of time 1948 to

00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:07.770
house during this period of time 1948 to
 

00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:11.750
house during this period of time 1948 to
the present well during the 1960's which

00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:11.760
the present well during the 1960's which
 

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:14.390
the present well during the 1960's which
is about 15 years after fountain house

00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:14.400
is about 15 years after fountain house
 

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:15.200
is about 15 years after fountain house
started

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:15.210
started
 

00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:17.900
started
you have the institutionalization starts

00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:17.910
you have the institutionalization starts
 

00:18:17.910 --> 00:18:20.330
you have the institutionalization starts
to occur there's a half a million people

00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:20.340
to occur there's a half a million people
 

00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:24.200
to occur there's a half a million people
who are in the state mental state mental

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:24.210
who are in the state mental state mental
 

00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:27.620
who are in the state mental state mental
hospital system most of whom by now are

00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:27.630
hospital system most of whom by now are
 

00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:29.680
hospital system most of whom by now are
out of that system I think there's about

00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:29.690
out of that system I think there's about
 

00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:32.930
out of that system I think there's about
75,000 people something like that and

00:18:32.930 --> 00:18:32.940
75,000 people something like that and
 

00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:37.130
75,000 people something like that and
and there was a change in understanding

00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:37.140
and there was a change in understanding
 

00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:40.910
and there was a change in understanding
how we treat this issue of mental

00:18:40.910 --> 00:18:40.920
how we treat this issue of mental
 

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:44.270
how we treat this issue of mental
illness that it the hospital isn't the

00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:44.280
illness that it the hospital isn't the
 

00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:46.160
illness that it the hospital isn't the
salt or the asylum it's really the

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:46.170
salt or the asylum it's really the
 

00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:48.170
salt or the asylum it's really the
asylum is not the approach we should

00:18:48.170 --> 00:18:48.180
asylum is not the approach we should
 

00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:52.220
asylum is not the approach we should
take people can live in society and we

00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:52.230
take people can live in society and we
 

00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:56.060
take people can live in society and we
and a lot of the push for

00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:56.070
and a lot of the push for
 

00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:58.700
and a lot of the push for
deinstitutionalization actually happened

00:18:58.700 --> 00:18:58.710
deinstitutionalization actually happened
 

00:18:58.710 --> 00:19:00.770
deinstitutionalization actually happened
within a legal context around least

00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:00.780
within a legal context around least
 

00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:02.960
within a legal context around least
restrictive environment and we've gone

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:02.970
restrictive environment and we've gone
 

00:19:02.970 --> 00:19:05.510
restrictive environment and we've gone
to almost the opposite end of the

to almost the opposite end of the
 

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:08.450
to almost the opposite end of the
extreme in terms of least restrictive

00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:08.460
extreme in terms of least restrictive
 

00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:11.960
extreme in terms of least restrictive
environment however think about this

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:11.970
environment however think about this
 

00:19:11.970 --> 00:19:16.640
environment however think about this
no grammatically anybody know what the

I just mentioned this because it's at
 

00:20:52.349 --> 00:20:54.919
I just mentioned this because it's at
the same time that we're to introduce

00:20:54.919 --> 00:20:54.929
the same time that we're to introduce
 

00:20:54.929 --> 00:20:59.359

really created a place where if what we
 

00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:08.180
really created a place where if what we
believe is the real issue facing us when

00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:08.190
believe is the real issue facing us when
 

00:21:08.190 --> 00:21:10.580

we believe is the fundamental issue that
 

00:22:01.409 --> 00:22:03.409
we believe is the fundamental issue that
that we're trying to address and that's

00:22:03.409 --> 00:22:03.419
that we're trying to address and that's

because essentially what community says
 

00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:16.370
because essentially what community says
is that no no you don't have to isolate

00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:16.380
is that no no you don't have to isolate
 

00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:18.770

surprisingly about from an aspect one of
the things that I've found one is that

00:47:53.309 --> 00:47:53.319
 

00:47:53.319 --> 00:47:57.459
one of the things that's interesting is

worker students do them so what an
 

00:48:54.030 --> 00:48:57.080
worker students do them so what an
inspiration so think about you know

students here might be the next jump

00:48:59.030 --> 00:48:59.040
students here might be the next jump
 

00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:01.220
students here might be the next jump
here in the years to come

00:49:01.220 --> 00:49:01.230
here in the years to come
 

00:49:01.230 --> 00:49:04.340
here in the years to come
so be creative and be yourself and think

00:49:04.340 --> 00:49:04.350
so be creative and be yourself and think
 

00:49:04.350 --> 00:49:06.890
so be creative and be yourself and think
things on your own feet

things on your own feet
and the other part about the research is

00:49:10.340 --> 00:49:10.350
and the other part about the research is
 

00:49:10.350 --> 00:49:13.400
and the other part about the research is
actually a lot to figure out who are the

00:49:13.400 --> 00:49:13.410
actually a lot to figure out who are the
 

00:49:13.410 --> 00:49:16.340
actually a lot to figure out who are the
staff members at firehouse and there are

00:49:16.340 --> 00:49:16.350
staff members at firehouse and there are
 

00:49:16.350 --> 00:49:18.500
staff members at firehouse and there are
quite I mean a little bit more it

00:49:18.500 --> 00:49:18.510
quite I mean a little bit more it
 

00:49:18.510 --> 00:49:21.950
quite I mean a little bit more it
studies being done there and so some go

00:49:21.950 --> 00:49:21.960
studies being done there and so some go
 

00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:24.920
studies being done there and so some go
for someone for the like a personality

00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:24.930
for someone for the like a personality
 

00:49:24.930 --> 00:49:26.660
for someone for the like a personality
route so they actually kinetic

00:49:26.660 --> 00:49:26.670
route so they actually kinetic
 

00:49:26.670 --> 00:49:28.940
route so they actually kinetic
personality test and so it turned out

00:49:28.940 --> 00:49:28.950
personality test and so it turned out
 

00:49:28.950 --> 00:49:32.800
personality test and so it turned out
you know um flexibility spontaneously

00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:32.810
you know um flexibility spontaneously
 

00:49:32.810 --> 00:49:35.960
you know um flexibility spontaneously
spontaneously and enthusiasm are

00:49:35.960 --> 00:49:35.970
spontaneously and enthusiasm are
 

00:49:35.970 --> 00:49:39.380
spontaneously and enthusiasm are
important to be to be a staff member at

00:49:39.380 --> 00:49:39.390
important to be to be a staff member at

important to be to be a staff member at
common house so it looks like it's

00:49:43.070 --> 00:49:43.080
common house so it looks like it's
 

00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:45.650
common house so it looks like it's
pretty much needs to be accurate to be

00:49:45.650 --> 00:49:45.660
pretty much needs to be accurate to be

quite so I would tell you what I saw and
by the other party is ready to have a

00:49:54.080 --> 00:49:54.090
by the other party is ready to have a
 

00:49:54.090 --> 00:49:56.690
by the other party is ready to have a
very optimistic attitude about a

very optimistic attitude about a
recovery that would be definitely

00:49:58.700 --> 00:49:58.710
recovery that would be definitely
 

00:49:58.710 --> 00:50:01.640
recovery that would be definitely
helpful to working from the house and to

00:50:01.640 --> 00:50:01.650
helpful to working from the house and to
 

00:50:01.650 --> 00:50:05.170

house they would be very helpful working
in in the clubhouse environment and add

00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:16.530
in in the clubhouse environment and add
 

00:50:16.530 --> 00:50:19.940
in in the clubhouse environment and add
to and I think you know is really the

00:50:19.940 --> 00:50:19.950
to and I think you know is really the
 

00:50:19.950 --> 00:50:23.000
to and I think you know is really the
conclusion from the research is it now

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:23.010
conclusion from the research is it now

and those are four there are four

00:50:49.420 --> 00:50:49.430
and those are four there are four
 

00:50:49.430 --> 00:50:51.819
and those are four there are four
particular concepts that the researchers

00:50:51.819 --> 00:50:51.829
particular concepts that the researchers
 

00:50:51.829 --> 00:50:55.329
particular concepts that the researchers
like picked up one year still really

00:50:55.329 --> 00:50:55.339
like picked up one year still really
 

00:50:55.339 --> 00:50:59.289
like picked up one year still really
solid in that develop affiliation a

00:50:59.289 --> 00:50:59.299
solid in that develop affiliation a
 

00:50:59.299 --> 00:51:01.210
solid in that develop affiliation a
sense of affiliation and support for

00:51:01.210 --> 00:51:01.220
sense of affiliation and support for
 

00:51:01.220 --> 00:51:04.140
sense of affiliation and support for
members and the other one is to create

00:51:04.140 --> 00:51:04.150
members and the other one is to create
 

00:51:04.150 --> 00:51:07.960
members and the other one is to create
the shared experiences with members in a

00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:07.970
the shared experiences with members in a
 

00:51:07.970 --> 00:51:11.920
the shared experiences with members in a
cop house and then also there are some

00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:11.930
cop house and then also there are some
 

00:51:11.930 --> 00:51:14.410
cop house and then also there are some
characteristics of cop house

00:51:14.410 --> 00:51:14.420
characteristics of cop house
 

00:51:14.420 --> 00:51:19.000

a sense of community that would include

00:51:21.430 --> 00:51:21.440
a sense of community that would include
 

00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:26.109
a sense of community that would include
for example the flexibility of the

00:51:26.109 --> 00:51:26.119
for example the flexibility of the
 

00:51:26.119 --> 00:51:30.520
for example the flexibility of the
structures and strict schedules and so

00:51:30.520 --> 00:51:30.530
structures and strict schedules and so
 

00:51:30.530 --> 00:51:33.309
structures and strict schedules and so
on so forth and there is a first concept

00:51:33.309 --> 00:51:33.319
on so forth and there is a first concept
 

00:51:33.319 --> 00:51:37.390
on so forth and there is a first concept
is to really make the task and the Ross

00:51:37.390 --> 00:51:37.400
is to really make the task and the Ross
 

00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:40.109
is to really make the task and the Ross
functional meaningful within the house

00:51:40.109 --> 00:51:40.119
functional meaningful within the house
 

00:51:40.119 --> 00:51:44.200
functional meaningful within the house
and that's you know I that's that's at

00:51:44.200 --> 00:51:44.210
and that's you know I that's that's at
 

00:51:44.210 --> 00:51:46.900

that's pretty much what sells about the

00:51:49.150 --> 00:51:49.160
that's pretty much what sells about the
 

00:51:49.160 --> 00:51:51.910
that's pretty much what sells about the
practices but there are actually a lot

00:51:51.910 --> 00:51:51.920
practices but there are actually a lot
 

00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:55.630
practices but there are actually a lot
of early writings about tootie's try to

you know more an artwork rather than
science and the other piece is about

00:53:06.670 --> 00:53:06.680
science and the other piece is about
 

00:53:06.680 --> 00:53:09.050

00:53:09.050 --> 00:53:09.060
relationships and the work order day
 

00:53:09.060 --> 00:53:11.450
relationships and the work order day
which is the way that people describe

a work order day and those are those two

00:53:22.850 --> 00:53:22.860
a work order day and those are those two
 

00:53:22.860 --> 00:53:24.710
a work order day and those are those two
components are actually very much

00:53:24.710 --> 00:53:24.720
components are actually very much
 

00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:26.570
components are actually very much
intertwined and people have our

00:53:26.570 --> 00:53:26.580
intertwined and people have our
 

00:53:26.580 --> 00:53:29.320
intertwined and people have our
relationship because of the way that

00:53:29.320 --> 00:53:29.330

people structure work on Thursday there

00:53:32.150 --> 00:53:32.160
people structure work on Thursday there
 

00:53:32.160 --> 00:53:34.520
people structure work on Thursday there
and the relationships is really rooted

00:53:34.520 --> 00:53:34.530
and the relationships is really rooted
 

00:53:34.530 --> 00:53:37.580
and the relationships is really rooted
in that kind of form and that kind of

00:53:37.580 --> 00:53:37.590
in that kind of form and that kind of
 

00:53:37.590 --> 00:53:41.030
in that kind of form and that kind of

00:53:41.030 --> 00:53:41.040
mode of interaction and a surpise I
 

00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:43.340
mode of interaction and a surpise I
think also interesting I wanted to

00:53:43.340 --> 00:53:43.350
think also interesting I wanted to
 

00:53:43.350 --> 00:53:46.640

highlight is to really to adapt a peer

00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:46.650
highlight is to really to adapt a peer
 

00:53:46.650 --> 00:53:49.070
highlight is to really to adapt a peer
role and that would require the staff

00:53:49.070 --> 00:53:49.080
role and that would require the staff
 

00:53:49.080 --> 00:53:51.620
role and that would require the staff
members to reduce the hierarchical power

00:53:51.620 --> 00:53:51.630
members to reduce the hierarchical power
 

00:53:51.630 --> 00:53:55.910
members to reduce the hierarchical power
structure and in I mean in a typical

00:53:55.910 --> 00:53:55.920
structure and in I mean in a typical
 

00:53:55.920 --> 00:53:57.850

environment the staff member or the

00:53:57.850 --> 00:53:57.860
environment the staff member or the
 

00:53:57.860 --> 00:54:00.020
environment the staff member or the
professionals would being a higher power

00:54:00.020 --> 00:54:00.030
professionals would being a higher power
 

00:54:00.030 --> 00:54:03.350

the self protective distance from the
 

00:54:10.410 --> 00:54:12.410
the self protective distance from the
members and so that's another piece that

00:54:12.410 --> 00:54:12.420
members and so that's another piece that
 

00:54:12.420 --> 00:54:17.810

I find very interesting okay and given

00:54:17.810 --> 00:54:17.820
I find very interesting okay and given
 

00:54:17.820 --> 00:54:22.130

there is such limited literature out

00:54:22.130 --> 00:54:22.140
there is such limited literature out
 

00:54:22.140 --> 00:54:25.460
there is such limited literature out
there in comparison to this fantastic

00:54:25.460 --> 00:54:25.470
there in comparison to this fantastic
 

00:54:25.470 --> 00:54:27.920

model so that really gave me in treating

00:54:27.920 --> 00:54:27.930
model so that really gave me in treating
 

00:54:27.930 --> 00:54:30.680
model so that really gave me in treating
I wanted to really learn more about it

00:54:30.680 --> 00:54:30.690
I wanted to really learn more about it
 

00:54:30.690 --> 00:54:33.020
I wanted to really learn more about it
and especially I think before in the

00:54:33.020 --> 00:54:33.030
and especially I think before in the
 

00:54:33.030 --> 00:54:34.970
and especially I think before in the
introduction I've been doing research

00:54:34.970 --> 00:54:34.980
introduction I've been doing research
 

00:54:34.980 --> 00:54:37.760
introduction I've been doing research
about direct practices in community

00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:37.770
about direct practices in community
 

00:54:37.770 --> 00:54:39.770
about direct practices in community
mental health programs and this is

00:54:39.770 --> 00:54:39.780
mental health programs and this is
 

00:54:39.780 --> 00:54:41.870
mental health programs and this is
certainly a model that I definitely

00:54:41.870 --> 00:54:41.880
certainly a model that I definitely
 

00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:46.609
certainly a model that I definitely
don't want to miss so I had a very good

00:54:46.609 --> 00:54:46.619
don't want to miss so I had a very good
 

00:54:46.619 --> 00:54:48.980
don't want to miss so I had a very good
fortune a lot of support and help and

00:54:48.980 --> 00:54:48.990
fortune a lot of support and help and
 

00:54:48.990 --> 00:54:52.040
fortune a lot of support and help and
then I last year I had this research

00:54:52.040 --> 00:54:52.050
then I last year I had this research
 

00:54:52.050 --> 00:54:56.000
then I last year I had this research
idea and very fortunately I was able to

00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:56.010
idea and very fortunately I was able to
 

00:54:56.010 --> 00:54:59.510
idea and very fortunately I was able to
really do it and so my focus is really

00:54:59.510 --> 00:54:59.520
really do it and so my focus is really
 

00:54:59.520 --> 00:55:02.330
really do it and so my focus is really
trying to go into the black box of

00:55:02.330 --> 00:55:02.340
trying to go into the black box of
 

00:55:02.340 --> 00:55:04.430
trying to go into the black box of
father house and trying to understand

kind of practice approaches and
strategies they are they are trying to

00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:10.890
strategies they are they are trying to

let's see if flats in one of those and

00:55:21.920 --> 00:55:21.930
let's see if flats in one of those and
 

00:55:21.930 --> 00:55:24.770
let's see if flats in one of those and
also the Cara sticks of this

00:55:24.770 --> 00:55:24.780
also the Cara sticks of this
 

00:55:24.780 --> 00:55:27.710
also the Cara sticks of this
organization what one is helpful for

00:55:27.710 --> 00:55:27.720
organization what one is helpful for

ah so I started my study in November

00:55:33.530 --> 00:55:33.540
ah so I started my study in November
 

00:55:33.540 --> 00:55:36.680
ah so I started my study in November
last year and so it's a almost a fact

00:55:36.680 --> 00:55:36.690
last year and so it's a almost a fact
 

00:55:36.690 --> 00:55:39.620

five months and almost six six months
now and my approach is doing participant

00:55:44.180 --> 00:55:44.190
now and my approach is doing participant
 

00:55:44.190 --> 00:55:46.640
now and my approach is doing participant
observation in-depth interviews and

realize this that as we hear from the

00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:26.490
realize this that as we hear from the
 

00:58:26.490 --> 00:58:32.890
realize this that as we hear from the
previous presentations it is a lot of

00:58:32.890 --> 00:58:32.900
previous presentations it is a lot of
 

00:58:32.900 --> 00:58:35.360
previous presentations it is a lot of
interactions between the staff and the

00:58:35.360 --> 00:58:35.370
interactions between the staff and the
 

00:58:35.370 --> 00:58:37.520
interactions between the staff and the
members and in a very very unique way

00:58:37.520 --> 00:58:37.530
members and in a very very unique way
 

00:58:37.530 --> 00:58:41.690
members and in a very very unique way
and so what I intended to do or to see

00:58:41.690 --> 00:58:41.700
and so what I intended to do or to see
 

00:58:41.700 --> 00:58:44.570
and so what I intended to do or to see
there is to see how that really looks

00:58:44.570 --> 00:58:44.580
there is to see how that really looks
 

00:58:44.580 --> 00:58:46.870
there is to see how that really looks
like you know we can read about it and

00:58:46.870 --> 00:58:46.880
like you know we can read about it and
 

00:58:46.880 --> 00:58:50.120
like you know we can read about it and
I'll give an example where the

00:58:50.120 --> 00:58:50.130
I'll give an example where the
 

00:58:50.130 --> 00:58:52.540
I'll give an example where the
internship the interest wouldn't really

00:58:52.540 --> 00:58:52.550
internship the interest wouldn't really
 

00:58:52.550 --> 00:58:55.460
internship the interest wouldn't really
couldn't really describe what's going on

00:58:55.460 --> 00:58:55.470
couldn't really describe what's going on

so that's actually one of the areas that
 

00:58:57.690 --> 00:59:00.650
so that's actually one of the areas that
I'm trying to focus on and trying to

00:59:00.650 --> 00:59:00.660
I'm trying to focus on and trying to
 

00:59:00.660 --> 00:59:03.320
I'm trying to focus on and trying to
sort of analyze what's going on there so

00:59:03.320 --> 00:59:03.330
sort of analyze what's going on there so
 

00:59:03.330 --> 00:59:07.760
sort of analyze what's going on there so
when so there are the lists here are the

00:59:07.760 --> 00:59:07.770
when so there are the lists here are the
 

00:59:07.770 --> 00:59:11.150
when so there are the lists here are the
areas where the staff members really

00:59:11.150 --> 00:59:11.160
areas where the staff members really
 

00:59:11.160 --> 00:59:14.300
areas where the staff members really
need to use themselves as the tool and

00:59:14.300 --> 00:59:14.310
need to use themselves as the tool and
 

00:59:14.310 --> 00:59:17.660

one thing is to engage members and how
 

00:59:17.670 --> 00:59:22.850
one thing is to engage members and how
do we do this and so when the staff try

00:59:22.850 --> 00:59:22.860
do we do this and so when the staff try
 

00:59:22.860 --> 00:59:25.280
do we do this and so when the staff try
to use themselves to engage members a

00:59:25.280 --> 00:59:25.290
to use themselves to engage members a
 

00:59:25.290 --> 00:59:27.580

individuals in a even higher ground you
have a much higher bar to reach because

01:01:06.740 --> 01:01:06.750
have a much higher bar to reach because
 

01:01:06.750 --> 01:01:09.470
have a much higher bar to reach because
you have to figure out what are you

01:01:09.470 --> 01:01:09.480
you have to figure out what are you
 

01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:13.010
you have to figure out what are you
really to be a professional working with

01:01:13.010 --> 01:01:13.020
really to be a professional working with
 

01:01:13.020 --> 01:01:15.770
really to be a professional working with
people with severe mental illness and so

01:01:15.770 --> 01:01:15.780
people with severe mental illness and so
 

01:01:15.780 --> 01:01:18.829
people with severe mental illness and so
this so it really puts you on your toes

01:01:18.829 --> 01:01:18.839
this so it really puts you on your toes
 

01:01:18.839 --> 01:01:20.990
this so it really puts you on your toes
all the time to figure out who you

01:01:20.990 --> 01:01:21.000
all the time to figure out who you
 

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:26.120
all the time to figure out who you
really are as a society there and the

01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:26.130
really are as a society there and the
 

01:01:26.130 --> 01:01:28.000
really are as a society there and the
other part is trying to reduce power

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:28.010
other part is trying to reduce power
 

01:01:28.010 --> 01:01:31.569
other part is trying to reduce power
differential and I think from the two

01:01:31.569 --> 01:01:31.579
differential and I think from the two
 

01:01:31.579 --> 01:01:34.370
differential and I think from the two
presenters before we hear a lot about

01:01:34.370 --> 01:01:34.380
presenters before we hear a lot about
 

01:01:34.380 --> 01:01:37.490
presenters before we hear a lot about
you know working side-by-side and

01:01:37.490 --> 01:01:37.500
you know working side-by-side and
 

01:01:37.500 --> 01:01:40.250
you know working side-by-side and
involve members but what does it really

01:01:40.250 --> 01:01:40.260
involve members but what does it really
 

01:01:40.260 --> 01:01:43.309
involve members but what does it really
take for you to do it it takes I think

01:01:43.309 --> 01:01:43.319
take for you to do it it takes I think
 

01:01:43.319 --> 01:01:46.280
take for you to do it it takes I think
for the staff members to be willing to

01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:46.290
for the staff members to be willing to
 

01:01:46.290 --> 01:01:48.230
for the staff members to be willing to
be vulnerable

01:01:48.230 --> 01:01:48.240
be vulnerable
 

01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:50.839
be vulnerable
one way or one thing that happens a lot

01:01:50.839 --> 01:01:50.849
one way or one thing that happens a lot
 

01:01:50.849 --> 01:01:53.840
one way or one thing that happens a lot
is that because

01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:53.850
is that because
 

01:01:53.850 --> 01:01:56.170
is that because
in front of house it really is

01:01:56.170 --> 01:01:56.180
in front of house it really is
 

01:01:56.180 --> 01:02:00.500
in front of house it really is
intentionally to be understaffed so all

01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:00.510
intentionally to be understaffed so all
 

01:02:00.510 --> 01:02:03.950
intentionally to be understaffed so all
the work you have to finish and it is by

01:02:03.950 --> 01:02:03.960
the work you have to finish and it is by
 

01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:08.560
the work you have to finish and it is by
default it is really the staff members

01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:08.570
default it is really the staff members
 

01:02:08.570 --> 01:02:11.030
default it is really the staff members
responsibility to finish the work so

01:02:11.030 --> 01:02:11.040
responsibility to finish the work so
 

01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:14.450
responsibility to finish the work so
what what can we do so so the this what

01:02:14.450 --> 01:02:14.460
what what can we do so so the this what
 

01:02:14.460 --> 01:02:16.580
what what can we do so so the this what
the way the staff members needs to do is

01:02:16.580 --> 01:02:16.590
the way the staff members needs to do is
 

01:02:16.590 --> 01:02:21.520
the way the staff members needs to do is
really to invite members to do that and

01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:21.530
really to invite members to do that and
 

01:02:21.530 --> 01:02:26.630
really to invite members to do that and
so and then the variability the need of

01:02:26.630 --> 01:02:26.640
so and then the variability the need of
 

01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:30.080
so and then the variability the need of
our ability is to be able to be okay

01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:30.090
our ability is to be able to be okay
 

01:02:30.090 --> 01:02:34.460
our ability is to be able to be okay
with rejections so for example like I I

01:02:34.460 --> 01:02:34.470
with rejections so for example like I I
 

01:02:34.470 --> 01:02:39.950
with rejections so for example like I I
was assigned and once that you make the

01:02:39.950 --> 01:02:39.960
was assigned and once that you make the
 

01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:44.870
was assigned and once that you make the
water picture for lunch and it's

01:02:44.870 --> 01:02:44.880

usually we have about a hundred you know

01:02:50.870 --> 01:02:50.880
usually we have about a hundred you know
 

01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:54.490
usually we have about a hundred you know
serve 100 meal during the lunch time so

01:02:54.490 --> 01:02:54.500
serve 100 meal during the lunch time so
 

01:02:54.500 --> 01:02:57.650
serve 100 meal during the lunch time so

01:02:57.650 --> 01:02:57.660
usually people will prepare maybe 1218
 

01:02:57.660 --> 01:03:01.580
usually people will prepare maybe 1218
water features and you know it it

01:03:01.580 --> 01:03:01.590
water features and you know it it
 

01:03:01.590 --> 01:03:03.890

01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:08.290
are waiting for a response and then just
 

01:10:08.290 --> 01:10:11.550
are waiting for a response and then just
about the time that she and I thought

01:10:11.550 --> 01:10:11.560
about the time that she and I thought
 

01:10:11.560 --> 01:10:14.250
about the time that she and I thought
that he might just reject and he said

01:10:14.250 --> 01:10:14.260
that he might just reject and he said
 

01:10:14.260 --> 01:10:15.780
that he might just reject and he said
okay I'll give it a try

01:10:15.780 --> 01:10:15.790
okay I'll give it a try
 

01:10:15.790 --> 01:10:18.870

attention right there but the staff

01:10:21.180 --> 01:10:21.190

different things and this is actually
 

01:12:44.110 --> 01:12:47.040
different things and this is actually
doing a disservice to sort of a dissect

01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:47.050
doing a disservice to sort of a dissect
 

01:12:47.050 --> 01:12:50.100
doing a disservice to sort of a dissect
them into three three areas because they

01:12:50.100 --> 01:12:50.110
them into three three areas because they
 

01:12:50.110 --> 01:12:53.129
them into three three areas because they
are really intertwined but for the

01:12:53.129 --> 01:12:53.139
are really intertwined but for the
 

01:12:53.139 --> 01:12:57.780
are really intertwined but for the
purpose of articulation I try to you

01:12:57.780 --> 01:12:57.790
purpose of articulation I try to you
 

01:12:57.790 --> 01:13:00.160

attend 203 area altogether so it takes a
lot of ability capacity to a coordinate

01:13:16.120 --> 01:13:16.130
lot of ability capacity to a coordinate
 

01:13:16.130 --> 01:13:19.350
lot of ability capacity to a coordinate
and the other part is to facilitate

you know people want and this is
 

01:15:47.810 --> 01:15:50.200
you know people want and this is
actually not an analogy that I came up

01:15:50.200 --> 01:15:50.210
actually not an analogy that I came up
 

01:15:50.210 --> 01:15:52.060
actually not an analogy that I came up
with it's actually from the interview

01:15:52.060 --> 01:15:52.070

terms of the characteristics that before

01:16:28.150 --> 01:16:28.160
terms of the characteristics that before
 

01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:30.700
terms of the characteristics that before
I described people can be loud can be

01:16:30.700 --> 01:16:30.710
I described people can be loud can be
 

01:16:30.710 --> 01:16:33.850
I described people can be loud can be
quiet and can be extroverts tension can

01:16:33.850 --> 01:16:33.860

kind of expertise hidden talents to the
place and it's no longer hidden believe

01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:43.850
place and it's no longer hidden believe
 

01:16:43.850 --> 01:16:45.370
place and it's no longer hidden believe
me and that staff actually have

01:16:45.370 --> 01:16:45.380
me and that staff actually have
 

01:16:45.380 --> 01:16:47.710
me and that staff actually have
opportunities to do to come up with

01:16:47.710 --> 01:16:47.720
opportunities to do to come up with
 

01:16:47.720 --> 01:16:50.470
opportunities to do to come up with
programs that fits in their interests

01:16:50.470 --> 01:16:50.480
programs that fits in their interests
 

01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:53.470
programs that fits in their interests
and talents too and then it also

01:16:53.470 --> 01:16:53.480
and talents too and then it also
 

01:16:53.480 --> 01:16:56.020
and talents too and then it also
stimulates learning through mutual

01:16:56.020 --> 01:16:56.030
stimulates learning through mutual
 

01:16:56.030 --> 01:16:58.210
stimulates learning through mutual
observation so everything is actually

01:16:58.210 --> 01:16:58.220
observation so everything is actually
 

01:16:58.220 --> 01:17:01.740
observation so everything is actually
out in the open when ice and think very

01:17:01.740 --> 01:17:01.750
out in the open when ice and think very
 

01:17:01.750 --> 01:17:03.940
out in the open when ice and think very
interesting about this place is that

01:17:03.940 --> 01:17:03.950
interesting about this place is that
 

01:17:03.950 --> 01:17:07.300
interesting about this place is that
there is a very limited space that's

01:17:07.300 --> 01:17:07.310
there is a very limited space that's
 

01:17:07.310 --> 01:17:10.060
there is a very limited space that's
behind the closed door so every activity

01:17:10.060 --> 01:17:10.070
behind the closed door so every activity
 

01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:12.520
behind the closed door so every activity
is interactions are out in the open and

01:17:12.520 --> 01:17:12.530
is interactions are out in the open and
 

01:17:12.530 --> 01:17:15.690
is interactions are out in the open and
I think that really really facilitates

01:17:15.690 --> 01:17:15.700
I think that really really facilitates
 

01:17:15.700 --> 01:17:18.430
I think that really really facilitates
modeling and observation and I

01:17:18.430 --> 01:17:18.440
modeling and observation and I
 

01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:20.860
modeling and observation and I
personally also learned a lot about from

01:17:20.860 --> 01:17:20.870
personally also learned a lot about from
 

01:17:20.870 --> 01:17:22.720
personally also learned a lot about from
how the practices by just sitting there

01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:22.730
how the practices by just sitting there
 

01:17:22.730 --> 01:17:26.170
how the practices by just sitting there
and watch and so that's actually a very

01:17:26.170 --> 01:17:26.180
and watch and so that's actually a very
 

01:17:26.180 --> 01:17:27.280
and watch and so that's actually a very
interesting aspect

01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:27.290
interesting aspect
 

01:17:27.290 --> 01:17:30.040
interesting aspect

and so it's it's really a very very

01:19:03.730 --> 01:19:03.740
and so it's it's really a very very
 

01:19:03.740 --> 01:19:07.720
and so it's it's really a very very
individualized idea and and and and

01:19:07.720 --> 01:19:07.730
individualized idea and and and and
 

01:19:07.730 --> 01:19:10.450
individualized idea and and and and
that's that the difference between where

01:19:10.450 --> 01:19:10.460
that's that the difference between where
 

01:19:10.460 --> 01:19:14.020
that's that the difference between where
they were and what where they are is a

01:19:14.020 --> 01:19:14.030
they were and what where they are is a
 

01:19:14.030 --> 01:19:16.180
they were and what where they are is a
success and that's the outcome that can

01:19:16.180 --> 01:19:16.190
success and that's the outcome that can
 

01:19:16.190 --> 01:19:18.220
success and that's the outcome that can
that actually I think it's very hard to

01:19:18.220 --> 01:19:18.230
that actually I think it's very hard to
 

01:19:18.230 --> 01:19:20.950
that actually I think it's very hard to
measure scientifically but it is very

01:19:20.950 --> 01:19:20.960
measure scientifically but it is very
 

01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:23.890
measure scientifically but it is very
meaningful qualitatively family

01:19:23.890 --> 01:19:23.900
meaningful qualitatively family
 

01:19:23.900 --> 01:19:28.900
meaningful qualitatively family
intentionality its I this is actually

01:19:28.900 --> 01:19:28.910
intentionality its I this is actually
 

01:19:28.910 --> 01:19:31.060
intentionality its I this is actually
also something that I found very very

01:19:31.060 --> 01:19:31.070
also something that I found very very
 

01:19:31.070 --> 01:19:34.480
also something that I found very very
impressed by the organization is is how

a program idea can be so consistently
reflected on the design

01:19:40.340 --> 01:19:40.350
reflected on the design
 

01:19:40.350 --> 01:19:45.470
reflected on the design
of the problem itself so the idea is for

01:19:45.470 --> 01:19:45.480
of the problem itself so the idea is for
 

01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:47.960
of the problem itself so the idea is for
the members who feel need to feel being

01:19:47.960 --> 01:19:47.970
the members who feel need to feel being

the members who feel need to feel being
needed and so there is infrastructure to

01:19:51.980 --> 01:19:51.990
needed and so there is infrastructure to
 

01:19:51.990 --> 01:19:55.550
needed and so there is infrastructure to
have understaffed design and so staff

01:19:55.550 --> 01:19:55.560
have understaffed design and so staff
 

01:19:55.560 --> 01:19:59.420

01:21:39.390 --> 01:21:41.480
together and I think that really gives
us a lot to think about and how we can

01:21:41.480 --> 01:21:41.490
us a lot to think about and how we can
 

01:21:41.490 --> 01:21:44.870
