00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:04.593
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:06.063
&gt;&gt; And do it all.

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.203
He's a cartoonist, playwright,
novelist, screenwriter,

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.306
children's book author
and now memoirist.

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.400
And he has won all the right
awards for his efforts; a Pulitzer,

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.153
an Obie, an Academy Award.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:23.743
Not bad for a guy who by his
own estimation was pretty inept

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.323
at most things growing up.

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:32.190
Feiffer was born in 1929

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.460
and weathered the depression
poor and Jewish in the Bronx.

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.856
He was the skinny kid,
the scared one.

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.023
Other kids had baseball
bats and could use them.

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.230
He had a piece of chalk
and to keep bullies

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.166
at bay he drew Popeye
on the sidewalk.

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:53.750
But the chalk wasn't magic.

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:54.936
The colleges he dreamed
of attending rejected him,

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.230
he had a miserable army stint,

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.096
and there was no end
to his mother troubles.

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.743
As he has said, there are people
who give you nothing but bad advice;

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.046
and unfortunately one
of them was my mother.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:10.880


00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.286
But Jules Feiffer overcame it all.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.590
Eventually his village
voice comic strip

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.916
which brilliantly reflects our
culture angst was syndicated

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:22.540
in 100 newspapers.

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.140
He illustrated the
classic children's book,

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.970
The Phantom Toll Booth; he wrote the
movie Carnal Knowledge; the play,

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.243
Little Murders; and now in his
memoir, Backing into Forward,

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:33.873
he takes us through the terrible and
wonderful odyssey that is his life.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.353
For more than 50 years that life has
been devoted to taking the powerful

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:44.046
down a notch or two; the
chalk is gone replaced

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:46.930
by sheaves of satirical comments.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.093
Feiffer is an American treasure for
both depth and style of his work.

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.503
He's analytical and witty and
he teaches us about ourselves.

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.690
As one reviewer has said he's
the link from Lenny Bruce

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.746
to Larry David; from James
Thurber to Art Spiegelman.

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.203
Please join me in welcoming
Jules Feiffer.

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:17.380
[ Applause ]

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:20.883
&gt;&gt; Jules Feiffer: It's
a pleasure to be here.

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:22.563
I've just finished a gig with a
Norton Juster in the kiddy section

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.403
and talking about his
new children's book,

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.720
Theodorus Gorge, which
I illustrated.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.750
And that illustrates the
varied career I have.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.480
Most people know me as
a cartoonist of course;

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:43.170
but even from the beginning
as a cartoonist

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.043
as a village voice cartoonist
beginning in October of 56,

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.956
it's never been about the
pictures alone and in some cases,

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.523
never about the pictures mainly.

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.403
It's always been about voice.

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.566
And this was not known
to me at the time;

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.920
it was not thought
about at the time.

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.580
But a time I was a kid
being a cartoonist was all

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.496
that interested me and what
cartooning meant was not gag

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.250
cartoons as one found out
in New York, I love those,

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:20.726
but I couldn't do them and
didn't think in that vein.

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:22.856
I was a strip cartoonist and loved
the strip clones and the strip clone

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:29.943
with words and pictures; and
the comic strip at the time,

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.273
the newspaper strip at the time,
unlike today when they reduced

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:38.976
so miniscule that you can't have
anything complicated in them,

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:41.686
you can't tell real stories in
them, they're not very funny

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:44.540
and they're not particularly
well-drawn.

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:46.373
A few are like Mutts and one or
two others; and a few still try

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.040
to be profound like Eric
Trudeau and the everlasting

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.240
and ever brilliant Doonesbury
but there ain't much out there.

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.600
But this was a form before it got
so reduced in size it used to run

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:02.030
across the page; and I'm talking
about the years of my growing up--

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.730
the 1930's and 40's, before
movies were in Technicolor.

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:11.933
There were a few in color but not
many, before the age of television,

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.533
and certainly before the age of
electronics and iPhones and videos

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.746
and one kind thing and another.

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.680
And the comic strip was
a major American form.

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.766
The comic strip was part of
the culture no less than movies

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.480
or theater; the comic strip was
joked about on radio by Bob Hope

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:39.766
and Fred Allen and other comedians
because it represented a focal point

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:42.723
that everybody understood.

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:44.466
When you talked about Dick Tracy
or Lil Abner or other characters

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.813
at the time in the 1940's,
there wasn't a member

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:50.966
of the audience numbering into
the millions who didn't know

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.113
who those characters
were or Andy Gump.

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:59.176
This was a form that had taken
the country form the time

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.543
of its inception and
it wasn't that old

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:05.170
because the first comic
strips began about 1890, 95.

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:10.036
And so when I was a kid in the
1930's, it was still in the age

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:17.306
of its early developmental years
and early experimental years.

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.816
It was no more than 30, 40 y ears
old which is still pretty young

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.870
for a field such as that and it
was also at its most engaging

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:25.763
and its most-- the
adventure strip had just come

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:32.710
into play a few years before; and
strips used to run across a page.

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:38.153
There were five columns, six columns
and you could get detail and detail

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:39.543
and detail in the drawing
and there were any number

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:40.600
of brilliant artists working in them

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:43.253
who never thought of
their work as art.

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:45.933
Milton Caniff who did Terry
and the Pirates which was one

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:51.480
of the great combinations
of storytelling of text

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:56.380
and pictures uniting the two of
them, he was a teacher to me.

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:01.256
I learned virtually nothing
in the schools I went to.

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:07.756
I spent 12 years of public education
in the Bronx, learned zilch.

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:13.043
But when I opened up those comic
strips whether it was Terry

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:18.056
and the Pirates by Eisner, whether
it was Prince Valiant by Hal Foster,

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.706
whether it was Lil Abner by
Al Capp or Abby and Slats

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:22.340
which was also written by
Al Capp and illustrated

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:25.470
by a great illustrator
named Irving Van Buren,

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:26.996
this was my education as a kid.

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:33.330
And particularly Will Eisner's
coming out with in 1940, The Spirit.

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:39.333
These masters and they were masters,
never saw themselves as artists.

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:42.973
They thought artists was
kind of a fancy statement.

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:43.120
They didn't regard
what they did as art.

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:50.000
They didn't regard what they did
as being part of any serious game.

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:51.546
It was just the way they made a
living and if they saw themselves

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:54.270
as anything, they liked to see
themselves as newspaper men

00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:57.346
in that Ben Heck, Charles
McArthur, tough guy stance.

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:05.233
They wanted to be seen and often
were as hard drinking, hard boozing,

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:09.350
gambling characters, gambling
and gambling, irresponsible,

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:10.296
meeting deadlines to the
last second with a hangover.

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:15.090
They liked that image of themselves
and the fact that these originals,

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:19.103
this originals art was
tossed, was destroyed,

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:20.763
was thrown out by the newspapers
once they had published it.

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:24.533
Nothing was saved though;
very little was saved.

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:28.793
It was not a shock to them,
they didn't view it as scant,

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:30.490
they didn't want their
work back, they didn't ask

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:36.310
for the originals back; they
didn't think they had any use other

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:40.790
than clutter and this went on for
years until a later generation

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:45.153
of younger cartoonists; namely
the generation I represented,

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:48.916
sold this stuff as something
these old timers didn't.

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:50.760


00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:55.003
But I love these guys and what
I loved mostly was the act

00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:02.543
of storytelling; how they told the
story, how they created character;

00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:06.243
how different characters
even in comic strips spoke

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:11.913
in different ways, had different
styles of vocal representation

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:14.746
so that you could recognize them
even without seeing their pictures.

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:20.013
And not all of them did
that but the best ones did.

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:21.240


00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:26.640
And this was part of my schooling
so when I, back in the 1950's,

00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:36.123
began my strip, it was a long time
since I had given up on the notion

00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:42.950
of being a traditional
strip cartoonist.

00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:47.776
I had done after I got out of the
Army in 1953 all sorts of attempts

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:48.143
to get syndicated and to have my
work which looked like their work

00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:54.576
and try to this is
what they do to me.

00:08:58.290 --> 00:08:58.390
They obliterate-- I'm
being censored.

00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:04.656
I wanted very much to be one of
the big boys and join the rank

00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:07.163
of the big boys as
I grew up with them.

00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:11.023
But I would try to do the more
traditional strips and send them

00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:13.606
around to various syndicates
and they were all turned down.

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:17.733
And finally, I was left
without any choice but to move

00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:23.330
in another direction because all the
traditional directions were close

00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:25.830
to me.

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:31.940
And when I went to the Village
Voice to show them my work,

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:32.763
the work I showed them was
not the traditional work

00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:39.396
but something I was trying out for
some time when I was in the Army,

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:44.463
outraged by the fact that the
United States Army would draft me

00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:45.570
of all people.

00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:49.636
I joined the Korean War
when I had other plans.

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:52.816
As Dick Cheney said, remember him?

00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:54.583
When he was asked why he was not in
the Vietnam War which he was so--

00:09:59.050 --> 00:09:59.203
rather his answer was,
"I had other priorities."

00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:03.030
Well so did I.

00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:07.830
I had certainly as many
priorities as Dick Cheney and most

00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:13.056
of them were less lethal.

00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:14.890
[ Applause ]

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:21.306
&gt;&gt; Jules Feiffer: But
not all of them.

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:27.173
And in the Army in reaction to
what I found was the oppressiveness

00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:31.803
of the military and the mindless

00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:33.690
of the military and
nothing has changed.

00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:38.916
I started drawing as
a means of survival;

00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:43.916
as a means of retaining my sanity.

00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:49.210
I began to make up story about
a little boy four years old

00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:52.076
who was drafted into
the Army by mistake.

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:54.153
Talk about metaphor.

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:59.153
And I called up Munro and it was
my first satire although I didn't

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:04.586
realize what it was going to be
and it was the first time I tried

00:11:05.530 --> 00:11:09.663
to work in terms of cartoon
narrative, telling a story in words

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:09.956
and pictures the way comic
strips are supposed to be,

00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:16.650
but also using the style in
the form of a children's book,

00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:18.043
a children's book for grownups but
certainly a children's approach

00:11:22.270 --> 00:11:25.336
where there is narrative
and there are balloons

00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:27.570
and there is the storytelling.

00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:33.446
And the storytelling takes a
little boy Munro through the Army

00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:34.490
where he tries to explain his
only four and nobody believes him.

00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:43.003
And the whole point behind the story
was to express my rage and my anger

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:51.640
at the policies of the military
and the policies of a country

00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:51.880
for that matter in the
midst of a Cold War,

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:57.026
where mindlessness
often ruled the day

00:11:58.370 --> 00:12:03.036
and good sense often was ruled out;
but to show it as I understood then

00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:10.663
and have always understood,
to show it in innocent terms.

00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:14.966
I understood that I
could not take a message

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:19.653
which at the time was quite
political and overt; take a message

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:21.620
that was countered to
the politics and notions

00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:26.633
and establish institutional
feel at the time.

00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:32.383
Take that and make it documented
rage; nobody would pay attention,

00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:33.206
it wouldn't be accepted and
nobody would hear what I'm saying.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:36.420
I had to do what I've
done my entire career

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:41.246
which was use sleight
of hand and fool them.

00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:47.876
Basically seduce the reader into a
story that was going to be charming,

00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:53.700
that was going to be innocent,
that was going to be fun

00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:55.820
and fun was operative here.

00:12:56.020 --> 00:12:56.970
I had to have fun doing it and so I
wanted it to be fun for the reader

00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:02.736
but I also thought the
fun was a way of getting

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:03.773
through the point before anybody
knows I'm slipping it at them.

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:10.373
The fun was there to say
strong things that ordinarily

00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:11.120
and polite company
back in the 1950's

00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:16.046
and the heyday McCarthyism
were not acceptable.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.333
So early on I learned in a sense
the approach that I have followed

00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:27.806
in forms I've worked in the
following 50 years and that was

00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:31.390
that you can't say it directly--
you can't make the point directly.

00:13:35.050 --> 00:13:38.916
You must say it indirectly and
not obscurely, not obtusely,

00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:44.263
you kind of sneak the reader
along and sneak the audience along

00:13:44.510 --> 00:13:47.710
if it's a theatrical form,
not leading him or her

00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:49.673
down a path they don't know
where they're going and often

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:53.436
as I write these things I
don't know where I'm going.

00:13:56.270 --> 00:13:56.453
It's often I don't know
where I'm headed at all.

00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:03.086
I heard Jonathan Franzen before
talking about his objection

00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:07.993
to those writers who say
their characters take over

00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:08.460
and of course he says
that's bologna,

00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:10.253
the characters never take over; and
that in a real book you know exactly

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:18.466
where you're going; and now I
have to warn you about truth.

00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:20.350
There is writer's truth which
is everything that I believe

00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:24.883
as a writer, and then
there is nonsense

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:30.493
which is what every
other writer believes.

00:14:30.950 --> 00:14:34.883
I've found that often with my
own work in all of these forms

00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:41.910
that the voice I chose be
canned as in the cartoons a form

00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:49.433
of improvisation; as one used to
see on the stage with Second City

00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:51.470
of Chicago or Nickles and
Nay [assumed spelling].

00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:56.776
We start with an opening line and
just follow the music of the word,

00:14:59.030 --> 00:14:59.220
see where it leads you not
knowing and I often didn't know

00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:02.816
where it was going and I knew
perhaps what I was aiming it.

00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:10.130
Something viscerally told me
say if I was making a comment

00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:12.863
about relationships, what
comment I wanted to make;

00:15:15.210 --> 00:15:16.343
I just didn't know how I
was going to get there.

00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:21.410
If it was about politics then it
was going to be the growing war

00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:21.773
of Vietnam at the time
or Civil Rights.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:24.400
I knew the point I wanted to get to;

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:26.223
I just had no real notion what
was going to take me there

00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:33.976
so it's a combination of having
intent and then giving up the intent

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:40.053
to the innocence of creation.

00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:44.940
And that innocence of creation when
you surrender to a higher truth

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:46.836
than anything the grain
will give you.

00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:52.123
You give up this for this
and you let the gut lead you

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:53.493
and you let the gut do the writing.

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:58.093
And the gut will take
you down a certain path

00:15:58.680 --> 00:15:59.413
and if it works it
will be the right path;

00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:01.623
and if it doesn't you go
back and do it over again.

00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:07.070
There are cartoons over the
years that I wrote and these were

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:09.443
at first acts of writing before
I drew them; that I would write

00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:12.586
on yellow scraps of paper
and they would go perfectly

00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:15.643
until the last panel; and
then I'd have no last panel;

00:16:18.810 --> 00:16:20.076
I'd have no payoff.

00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:21.836
I thought this was great stuff,
I have no way of ending it;

00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:24.533
give up after a day or so
and put it away in the file,

00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:30.300
and sometimes 25 years later
I'd go through that file looking

00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:34.453
for something else, find
the cartoon, read it

00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:35.416
and suddenly the last panel would
write itself but I'd have it

00:16:38.770 --> 00:16:38.843
in a minute, in less than a minute.

00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:43.296
And there it was a perfect cartoon

00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:44.350
that took only 25 years
to put together.

00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:49.750
And 25 years earlier I wouldn't
have had a clue how to do it.

00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:53.020
These things do take control of you.

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:54.830
It's not you who are running it
although you do run it sometimes

00:16:56.890 --> 00:16:56.923
and sometimes the things you do run

00:16:59.190 --> 00:17:02.590
and do control are often
your most mediocre efforts.

00:17:04.210 --> 00:17:08.276
Sometimes, often time I find
that the work that's most allowed

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:11.760
when I'm at it is the
work that controls me

00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:13.990
as much as I'm controlling it.

00:17:15.070 --> 00:17:17.070
That when I went into theater,

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:23.773
my first play Little
Murders, was a thesis play.

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:24.623
I was trying to say something
about the disillusion-- hello.

00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:30.083
I've never worked in a
room like this before.

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:37.640
I was trying to say something
about the disillusion of authority

00:17:39.330 --> 00:17:42.263
in America post John F.
Kennedy assassination

00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:44.910
after November 22, 1963.

00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:52.253
For the following year I
noticed increasingly a breakdown

00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:58.110
of all forms of authority both
personal levels in families

00:17:59.090 --> 00:18:01.623
and in institutional
levels in schools,

00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:04.406
religion, certainly government.

00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:05.030
Everything seemed to
be falling apart

00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:08.896
as it had not done for many years.

00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:10.066
Basically we had been when Kennedy
was President the same country we

00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:17.580
had been from the days before World
War II after the depression on.

00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:19.630
And suddenly it was all falling
apart and becoming unglued

00:18:23.090 --> 00:18:23.390
and I was waiting just to read
the people writing about it

00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:26.750
and hear some comment on
it and it wasn't happening.

00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:34.096
And so my first play, my first
play came about purely by accident

00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:38.696
because I wanted to
comment on this thing

00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:40.106
that wasn't being commented on.

00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:42.556
I knew the cartoon which was my
form at the time and my only form

00:18:45.790 --> 00:18:50.323
at the time, wasn't adequate to say
something as profound as I wanted

00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:55.603
to say so I began fooling
around with the idea of a novel

00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:56.500
that got nowhere; and finally
in desperation as a play.

00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:04.220
And the play began with me having
lots of notes about what I wanted

00:19:07.030 --> 00:19:07.206
to do but really not
knowing how to go about it

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:10.583
and then simply writing it
down and letting it take over.

00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:13.136
And it take over and it lead me down
these paths, some of which worked,

00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:19.710
some of which didn't but became--

00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:20.560
my first play taught me that I was
a playwright and from that point

00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:28.853
on I engaged in this career of
where theater writing was every bit

00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:30.683
of much fun and in many cases more
fun than writing a comic strip;

00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:37.723
and that led me into other forms
and I should say it was all

00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:42.273
about voice-- that the voice of
the comic strip which has to be

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:44.033
because of the form six or eight
panels, has to be [inaudible],

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:51.086
has to be restrictive, that's not
the voice you use as a playwright.

00:19:52.250 --> 00:19:53.110
That as a playwright you've got a
lot of room to talk and you can talk

00:19:55.990 --> 00:19:56.723
and talk and talk, and
you have monologues

00:19:57.990 --> 00:19:58.746
and you can have a lot
of fun with language.

00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:03.766
You can indulge in language
in theater the way you can't

00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:07.153
and shouldn't in a comic
strip or in a movie;

00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:11.456
and then writing a screenplay
which is unfriendly the monologues,

00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:12.023
you've read another form so all of
these forms have different demands

00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:17.306
but they're all about voice,
they're all about language.

00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:20.340
When I started writing the
memoir Backing into Forward,

00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:22.006
the book I'm going to talk
about and having directly,

00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:28.673
I had to find a voice for
the guy telling the story

00:20:30.010 --> 00:20:34.143
that the first person in memoirs
or in anything that's supposed

00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:37.846
to be personal and
biographical, is only a substitute

00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:40.913
for who and what you really are.

00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:46.913
It's a front; it's an idealized
version of how you want to come

00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:51.973
across because none of us including
me right now really sounds that way.

00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:56.053
You're going to be saying
everything you believe on paper

00:20:56.650 --> 00:20:59.316
but you're putting it
in ways that as far

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:00.713
as you can manage are the
most engaging to the reader,

00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:07.126
the most seductive to the
reader, the most open seeming,

00:21:08.290 --> 00:21:09.276
but all of it has to do not just
with putting it down it also has

00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:16.036
to do with art and craft and years
of learning what people will take

00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:17.790
and what they won't take, what plays
before an audience and what doesn't.

00:21:21.150 --> 00:21:21.813
So all of it is a form of
like I said before a sleight

00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:25.420
of hand; it's a game.

00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:29.286
And it's that game that
I've never stopped playing

00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:31.700
and still enjoy playing.

00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:33.433
It says I'm in overtime
which means there's no time

00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:35.833
for questions or is there?

00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:37.966
There is time for questions.

00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:39.700
Two questions all right.

00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:40.233
Who has two very good questions?

00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:44.100
Now I've got to tell you this.

00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:44.766
It doesn't matter who
asks the questions;

00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:46.500
I'm not going to hear them I'm deaf.

00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:48.333
So it might be best if
you came right up here

00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:54.266
and addressed them directly
and forgive me but I'm...

00:21:58.310 --> 00:22:03.043
&gt;&gt; Audience question: First of all I
just want to say that I'm a big fan

00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:04.920
of the book about the book about
the boy going into the Army.

00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:06.520
I remember the panel where
he was sitting taking a test

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:11.533
and he was making a drawing--

00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:12.903
a picture and the soldier
next to him was looking over

00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:16.416
and copying that picture.

00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:16.946
But I did want to ask you you're
talking about cartoonists,

00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:20.963
and I was wondering how you
feel about animated movies

00:22:23.410 --> 00:22:23.853
and television shows like-- that
work with Brad Bird, the Incredibles

00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:31.966
and Ratatouille, and if that in any
way is similar to what was going

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:33.626
on with the [inaudible]
you talked about?

00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:37.826
&gt;&gt; Jules Feiffer: Frankly
I don't know why--

00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:42.576
I've worked in animation
and used to work in the 50's

00:22:43.050 --> 00:22:45.916
and the 60'sto an outfit
called Terry Tunes.

00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:46.986
I did Tom Terrific which
some of you may remember.

00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:52.786
But I've never been interested
in animation as a form

00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:55.590
and I never wanted to
do animated cartoons.

00:22:58.070 --> 00:23:01.470
Munro as an animated cartoon
came around by accident

00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:02.330
because it was Jean Diegh [assumed
spelling] who ran Terry Tunes

00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:07.983
who bought it was very
happy with the results

00:23:10.530 --> 00:23:12.396
and it won an Academy Award.

00:23:12.530 --> 00:23:14.996
But I don't look at
animated cartoons.

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:20.773
I haven't seen Up, I haven't seen--
Miyazaki the Japanese filmmakers,

00:23:21.090 --> 00:23:22.083
the one I've seen more of
and I think is brilliant,

00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:26.230
and there's one called
My Dog Two about now

00:23:27.530 --> 00:23:27.863
which is a wonderful piece of work.

00:23:29.530 --> 00:23:30.220
And there's countless
wonderful things being done

00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:32.306
and it will remain uncounted by me

00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:34.773
because I'm not going
to see most of them.

00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:39.173
It's not a film I have a
lot of curiosity about.

00:23:41.030 --> 00:23:42.030


00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:46.016
&gt;&gt; Audience question: I was
wondering what your experience was

00:23:46.030 --> 00:23:50.630
like working with Mike Nichols on
the screenplay for Carnal Knowledge.

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:55.480
Was it a pleasant experience
with Hollywood people or not?

00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:57.310


00:23:57.410 --> 00:23:58.760
&gt;&gt; Jules Feiffer: Now for those of
you who've read the book Backing

00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:01.666
into Forward you wouldn't have to
ask that question so I urge you

00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:05.853
to buy the book else why am I here?

00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:09.260


00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:10.303
It's-- Carnal Knowledge was
originally written as a play.

00:24:13.910 --> 00:24:17.976
I've sent it to Mike he read it
in 24 hours and called me back

00:24:18.090 --> 00:24:18.883
and he said I want to do this but
I think it's a movie not a play.

00:24:21.630 --> 00:24:22.830
What do you think?

00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:23.963
And I said what about the language?

00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:28.150
He said we won't have any trouble
with the language what do you think?

00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:29.710
And I said give me 30 seconds.

00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:35.006
And then he really put me
through when it came time to work

00:24:36.090 --> 00:24:40.223
on the screenplay a tutorial on
how you turn a play script full

00:24:42.130 --> 00:24:46.663
of long speeches as we talked about
what theater is into a screenplay

00:24:47.610 --> 00:24:48.430
where we did have monologues
but didn't run nearly as long

00:24:50.590 --> 00:24:54.790
as the ones in the play; and to
make it seem natural to the form

00:24:56.180 --> 00:24:58.713
and it was from beginning
to end it was

00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:03.500
about the most joyful
collaboration I've ever had

00:25:04.350 --> 00:25:04.750
and I've been fortunate
to have a lot

00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:09.283
of good collaborations
but this was the best.

00:25:10.330 --> 00:25:10.556

of the Library of Congress.
