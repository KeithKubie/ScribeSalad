then and now and I chose to extend my

comments to not only cover then and now

comments to not only cover then and now
 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:23.550
comments to not only cover then and now
but to also talk about then and now and

then because what I really want to focus

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:26.619
then because what I really want to focus
 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:29.700
then because what I really want to focus
on is important trends and developments

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:29.710
on is important trends and developments
 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.609

as they're defining not so much where

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:32.619
as they're defining not so much where
 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:34.710
as they're defining not so much where
we've been and where we find ourselves

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:34.720
we've been and where we find ourselves
 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.229
we've been and where we find ourselves
but most importantly where I think we

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:37.239
but most importantly where I think we
 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:41.010
but most importantly where I think we
are going my remarks also will focus at

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:41.020
are going my remarks also will focus at
 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.889
are going my remarks also will focus at
a pretty high level looking at the

00:00:43.889 --> 00:00:43.899
a pretty high level looking at the
 

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:46.350
a pretty high level looking at the
research library of the context in which

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:46.360
research library of the context in which
 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.500
research library of the context in which
eurasian collections have and will be

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510
eurasian collections have and will be
 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.750
eurasian collections have and will be
developed and used by students and

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760
developed and used by students and
 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.240
developed and used by students and
scholars i'm hoping that in this

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:54.250
scholars i'm hoping that in this
 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.670
scholars i'm hoping that in this
afternoon session will translate some of

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:56.680
afternoon session will translate some of
 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.880
afternoon session will translate some of
these ideas into perhaps more practical

00:00:59.880 --> 00:00:59.890
these ideas into perhaps more practical
 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.150
these ideas into perhaps more practical
thinking about where we're research

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.160
thinking about where we're research
 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.070

libraries are going but i really want to

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080
libraries are going but i really want to
 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.710
libraries are going but i really want to
push this to a level of discussion and

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720
push this to a level of discussion and
 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.020
push this to a level of discussion and
thinking that really challenges us not

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030
thinking that really challenges us not
 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.359
thinking that really challenges us not
only to focus on the eurasian

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:12.369
only to focus on the eurasian
 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:15.419
only to focus on the eurasian
collections but the larger sphere of

academic research libraries where we

00:01:17.669 --> 00:01:17.679
academic research libraries where we
 

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:20.520
academic research libraries where we
find ourselves and where perhaps we

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530
find ourselves and where perhaps we
 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.749
find ourselves and where perhaps we
think we are going in that context I've

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:24.759
think we are going in that context I've
 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:27.089
think we are going in that context I've
been working over the last several

00:01:27.089 --> 00:01:27.099
been working over the last several
 

00:01:27.099 --> 00:01:33.359

months on developing a let's make sure

we get the technology working properly

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:47.699

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090
academic research library I would argue
 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.059
academic research library I would argue
that prior to nineteen fifty there were

00:01:57.059 --> 00:01:57.069
that prior to nineteen fifty there were
 

00:01:57.069 --> 00:01:59.550
that prior to nineteen fifty there were
actually several handfuls of libraries

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560
actually several handfuls of libraries
 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.680
actually several handfuls of libraries
that by current definitions we would

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690
that by current definitions we would
 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.900
that by current definitions we would
describe as research libraries I think

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:03.910
describe as research libraries I think
 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:07.369

this was a period of exclusivity of a

this was a period of exclusivity of a
 

00:02:07.379 --> 00:02:09.779
this was a period of exclusivity of a
small number of libraries on the East

we would define the current context of

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730
we would define the current context of
 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.319
we would define the current context of
as as research libraries and therefore i

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:25.329
as as research libraries and therefore i
 

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:28.110
as as research libraries and therefore i
think the number of collections of your

being part of that york public is being
 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.460
being part of that york public is being
part of that but i think it's only after

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470
part of that but i think it's only after
 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.470
part of that but i think it's only after
nineteen fifty of a period of

nineteen fifty of a period of
 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.170
nineteen fifty of a period of

i enter the library field just after
 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:32.759
i enter the library field just after
1970 and it was a period of the next two

period of discord i think it's a period

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510
period of discord i think it's a period
 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.439
period of discord i think it's a period
in which we see the entrance of

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:39.449
in which we see the entrance of
 

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:42.360

conservative analog environment it's the

conservative analog environment it's the
period of time where we see the online

period of time where we see the online
 

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:51.000
period of time where we see the online

unions in universities and libraries we
 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:02.520
unions in universities and libraries we
see the publishers becoming increasingly

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530
see the publishers becoming increasingly
 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.089
see the publishers becoming increasingly

this is sort of the grand scheme that I
put out for your you're thinking about

current in the current context where we

00:07:38.119 --> 00:07:38.129
current in the current context where we

have not only the challenges of economy
 

00:07:40.259 --> 00:07:43.219
have not only the challenges of economy
and we have the challenges of Technology

the investments that we need to make
moving forward is I see a pretty

00:07:48.409 --> 00:07:48.419
moving forward is I see a pretty
 

00:07:48.419 --> 00:07:51.350
moving forward is I see a pretty
broad-based reduction in the commitment

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:51.360
broad-based reduction in the commitment
 

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:54.110
broad-based reduction in the commitment
and capacity of research libraries to

global publications and resources in all
 

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:02.809
global publications and resources in all

00:08:02.819 --> 00:08:04.760

libraries that in fact have the capacity

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:04.770
libraries that in fact have the capacity
 

00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:09.230
libraries that in fact have the capacity
to do this I think it's also true that

00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:09.240
to do this I think it's also true that
 

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:11.089
to do this I think it's also true that
we're getting a lot of new thinking

00:08:11.089 --> 00:08:11.099
we're getting a lot of new thinking
 

00:08:11.099 --> 00:08:12.769
we're getting a lot of new thinking
around how we're going to work together

around how we're going to work together

how these collaborations will come

how these collaborations will come
 

00:08:14.639 --> 00:08:16.399
how these collaborations will come
together but I think up until recently

it's true I think across the university

it's true I think across the university
and college communities is we've

00:20:59.100 --> 00:20:59.110
and college communities is we've
 

00:20:59.110 --> 00:21:01.290
and college communities is we've
developed and supported these rich

information environments and then

00:21:03.450 --> 00:21:03.460
information environments and then
 

00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:05.580
information environments and then
students graduate and they go off

00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:05.590
students graduate and they go off
 

00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:09.360
students graduate and they go off
somewhere maybe they land in a graduate

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:09.370
somewhere maybe they land in a graduate
 

00:21:09.370 --> 00:21:11.160

00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:30.640
information environments and we think
 

00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:33.600
information environments and we think
that this is very helpful in as we build

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:33.610
that this is very helpful in as we build
 

00:21:33.610 --> 00:21:34.740
that this is very helpful in as we build

similar experiences and working and
 

00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:46.320
similar experiences and working and
talking with our faculty this is sort of

00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:46.330
talking with our faculty this is sort of
 

00:21:46.330 --> 00:21:48.990
talking with our faculty this is sort of
a list of the things that we've learned

00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:49.000
a list of the things that we've learned
 

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.110
a list of the things that we've learned
from our faculty at Columbia and which

00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:52.120
from our faculty at Columbia and which
 

00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:55.590
from our faculty at Columbia and which
has been affirmed by similar studies at

00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:55.600
has been affirmed by similar studies at
 

00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:58.350
has been affirmed by similar studies at
other institutions this is what faculty

00:21:58.350 --> 00:21:58.360
other institutions this is what faculty
 

00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:00.300

Ellis is really important and meaningful

00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:00.310
Ellis is really important and meaningful

to their success and their advancement
 

00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:06.540
to their success and their advancement
in their careers at an institution so we

00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:06.550
in their careers at an institution so we
 

00:22:06.550 --> 00:22:09.540
in their careers at an institution so we
need to ask the question of how do we

00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:09.550
need to ask the question of how do we
 

00:22:09.550 --> 00:22:10.810
need to ask the question of how do we
measure why

00:22:10.810 --> 00:22:10.820

is going forward do we measure libraries

00:22:13.210 --> 00:22:13.220
is going forward do we measure libraries
 

00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:14.409
is going forward do we measure libraries
by the number of people come in the

by the number of people come in the
 

00:22:14.419 --> 00:22:17.259
by the number of people come in the
front door do we measure libraries by

00:22:17.259 --> 00:22:17.269
front door do we measure libraries by
 

00:22:17.269 --> 00:22:19.570
front door do we measure libraries by
the number of hits on our website do we

00:22:19.570 --> 00:22:19.580
the number of hits on our website do we
 

00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:21.100
the number of hits on our website do we
measure it by the number of items that

00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:21.110
measure it by the number of items that
 

00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:22.450
measure it by the number of items that
have been circulated out of the print

00:22:22.450 --> 00:22:22.460
have been circulated out of the print
 

00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:24.669

collection or do we begin to see

00:22:24.669 --> 00:22:24.679
collection or do we begin to see
 

00:22:24.679 --> 00:22:27.580
collection or do we begin to see
ourselves as measured in terms of

graduate success faculty productivity
 

00:22:31.130 --> 00:22:34.600
graduate success faculty productivity
and how do we draw those lines that is

00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:34.610
and how do we draw those lines that is

it's the very question so that we need

little bit about repositories it's of
 

00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:41.370
little bit about repositories it's of

their work scholars used to put it into

what I call the publisher repository and

00:45:52.170 --> 00:45:52.180
what I call the publisher repository and
 

00:45:52.180 --> 00:45:54.150
what I call the publisher repository and
we could depend on that was the place

00:45:54.150 --> 00:45:54.160
we could depend on that was the place
 

00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:56.910
we could depend on that was the place
that we went to access and use

00:45:56.910 --> 00:45:56.920

00:45:56.920 --> 00:45:59.940
that we went to access and use

00:46:02.290 --> 00:46:04.500
object increasingly now it's a database
but it's still owned and served by the

on their own websites their own work
 

00:46:08.080 --> 00:46:10.020
on their own websites their own work
they're putting it up on institutional

00:46:10.020 --> 00:46:10.030
they're putting it up on institutional
 

00:46:10.030 --> 00:46:12.450
they're putting it up on institutional
repositories Columbia academic commons

00:46:12.450 --> 00:46:12.460

00:46:12.460 --> 00:46:14.640
repositories Columbia academic commons
they're putting it up on disciplinary

00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:14.650
they're putting it up on disciplinary
 

00:46:14.650 --> 00:46:16.590
they're putting it up on disciplinary
repositories repositories of which there

00:46:16.590 --> 00:46:16.600
repositories repositories of which there
 

00:46:16.600 --> 00:46:18.150
repositories repositories of which there
are thousands they're putting it into

00:46:18.150 --> 00:46:18.160
are thousands they're putting it into
 

00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:20.880

government repositories in some

00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:20.890
government repositories in some
 

00:46:20.890 --> 00:46:22.650
government repositories in some
countries there's a mandate to put stuff

00:46:22.650 --> 00:46:22.660
countries there's a mandate to put stuff
 

00:46:22.660 --> 00:46:25.260
countries there's a mandate to put stuff
into national repositories and so I

00:46:25.260 --> 00:46:25.270
into national repositories and so I
 

00:46:25.270 --> 00:46:26.520
into national repositories and so I
think we're creating the sort of chaotic

00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:26.530
think we're creating the sort of chaotic
 

00:46:26.530 --> 00:46:29.370
think we're creating the sort of chaotic
environment of the output of scholars

00:46:29.370 --> 00:46:29.380
environment of the output of scholars
 

00:46:29.380 --> 00:46:32.430
environment of the output of scholars
not sure which one I site which one will

00:46:32.430 --> 00:46:32.440
not sure which one I site which one will
 

00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:34.650
not sure which one I site which one will
survive which one's the right one which

00:46:34.650 --> 00:46:34.660
survive which one's the right one which
 

00:46:34.660 --> 00:46:36.200
survive which one's the right one which
one hasn't been changed

00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:36.210
one hasn't been changed
 

00:46:36.210 --> 00:46:38.880
one hasn't been changed
so it's a real interesting problem which

00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:38.890
so it's a real interesting problem which
 

00:46:38.890 --> 00:46:41.010
so it's a real interesting problem which
I think scholarship faces and I think

00:46:41.010 --> 00:46:41.020
I think scholarship faces and I think
 

00:46:41.020 --> 00:46:42.900
I think scholarship faces and I think
each discipline those who work in
