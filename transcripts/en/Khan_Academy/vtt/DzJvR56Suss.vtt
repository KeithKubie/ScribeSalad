00:00:00.342 --> 00:00:01.426
- [Voiceover] What I wanna show you now

00:00:01.426 --> 00:00:02.416
is a way to add numbers,

00:00:02.416 --> 00:00:04.102
or a way that I sometimes add numbers,

00:00:04.102 --> 00:00:05.981
when I'm doing it in my head.

00:00:05.981 --> 00:00:09.303
So let's say I wanna add five to 68.

00:00:09.303 --> 00:00:11.549
And we've already seen
other ways of doing it,

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:12.725
so what I'm showing in this video

00:00:12.725 --> 00:00:13.748
isn't the only way to do it

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:16.686
but it might be helpful when
you're doing it in your head.

00:00:16.686 --> 00:00:20.004
Well when I look at a number
like 68 I think well gee,

00:00:20.004 --> 00:00:24.036
If I added just two to
that I would get to 70.

00:00:24.036 --> 00:00:28.949
So why don't I break up
five into three and two,

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.293
add the two to 68 and then
I have to add the three.

00:00:33.293 --> 00:00:34.924
So what's that going to get me?

00:00:34.924 --> 00:00:39.688
Well if I break up the
five into three plus two,

00:00:39.688 --> 00:00:42.508
and the whole reason why I
broke it up into three and two

00:00:42.508 --> 00:00:45.051
is so I have this two here to add to 68.

00:00:45.051 --> 00:00:47.924
So five is three plus two,

00:00:47.924 --> 00:00:52.525
and to that I'm going to add 68, 68.

00:00:52.587 --> 00:00:55.794
And once again the reason
why I took this two out

00:00:55.794 --> 00:00:56.858
is because I said hey,

00:00:56.859 --> 00:00:59.882
what do I have to add to 68 to get to 70?

00:00:59.882 --> 00:01:03.489
So now I could just rewrite this as,

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:08.490
Three plus two plus 68, 68.

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.924
But now I can add the two to the 68.

00:01:13.924 --> 00:01:17.873
So two plus 68 is going to be

00:01:17.873 --> 00:01:20.344
Two plus 68 is 70.

00:01:21.559 --> 00:01:24.048
70 and I still have this three here,

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:28.757
so I have three plus 70
which is equal to 73.

00:01:29.865 --> 00:01:31.261
73.

00:01:31.261 --> 00:01:34.848
Now it might seem like this
really long way of doing it,

00:01:34.849 --> 00:01:37.262
but this is just a way to think about it.

00:01:37.262 --> 00:01:39.689
In your head you'd say okay five plus 68,

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.160
let's see if I add two
to 68 I'll get to 70

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.271
and so let's see, five is three plus two,

00:01:46.272 --> 00:01:48.825
I add the two to 68, I get to 70,

00:01:48.825 --> 00:01:50.360
and I have three left over.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.392
So it's going to be 73.

00:01:52.392 --> 00:01:55.905
Another way you could think
about it is on a number line.

00:01:55.905 --> 00:01:58.512
So let's draw ourselves
a number line here.

00:01:58.512 --> 00:02:02.544
Let's draw a number line
and let me draw some

00:02:02.544 --> 00:02:06.328
let me draw some tick marks here.

00:02:06.328 --> 00:02:09.136
And let's say that this right over here,

00:02:09.136 --> 00:02:13.511
this right over here is 68,

00:02:13.511 --> 00:02:17.272
and so this is going to be 70,

00:02:17.272 --> 00:02:19.791
this is going to be 70,

00:02:19.791 --> 00:02:21.710
and we're gonna add five.

00:02:21.711 --> 00:02:23.567
We're gonna add five.

00:02:23.567 --> 00:02:26.335
So if you add five you say
well let me add two first.

00:02:26.335 --> 00:02:29.607
So if I add two first I get to 70.

00:02:29.607 --> 00:02:31.026
So plus two,

00:02:31.026 --> 00:02:33.159
that's what I did right
over here to get to 70,

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:37.007
and then if I wanna add five
then I have to add three more.

00:02:37.007 --> 00:02:39.374
Then I have to add three more.

00:02:40.575 --> 00:02:43.182
And so it's going to be 70 plus three.

00:02:43.182 --> 00:02:46.720
Which of course is 73.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.087
Hopefully you found that interesting.
