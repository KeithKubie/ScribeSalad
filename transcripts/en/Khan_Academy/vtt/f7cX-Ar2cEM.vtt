00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:02.060
Solve this system.

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:04.839
And once again, we have three
equations with three unknowns.

00:00:04.839 --> 00:00:06.630
So this is essentially
trying to figure out

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:08.720
where three different
planes would

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.120
intersect in three dimensions.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.884
And to do this, if we want to
do it by elimination, if we want

00:00:13.884 --> 00:00:15.300
to be able to
eliminate variables,

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.750
it looks like, well, it looks
like we have a negative z here.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.050
We have a plus 2z.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:21.760
We have a 5z over here.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.500
If we were to scale up this
third equation by positive 2,

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.180
then you would have
a negative 2z here,

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:30.350
and it would cancel
out with this 2z there.

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:32.670
And then if you were
to scale it up by 5,

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:34.830
you'd have a negative
5z here, and then that

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:36.976
could cancel out with
that 5z over there.

00:00:36.976 --> 00:00:38.100
So let's try to cancel out.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.339
Let's try to eliminate
the z's first.

00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:42.130
So let me start with
this equation up here.

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:43.480
I'll just rewrite it.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.580
So we have-- I'll draw
an arrow over here--

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:53.770
we have x plus 2y plus 5z
is equal to negative 17.

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.170
And then to cancel out or
to eliminate the z's, I'll

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.160
multiply this
equation here times 5.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.980
So I'm going to multiply
this equation times 5.

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.470
So we have to multiply
both sides by 5.

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:11.790
So 3x times 5 is 15x, y times
5 is plus 5y, and then negative

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.645
z times 5 is negative 5z--
that's the whole point

00:01:14.645 --> 00:01:18.610
and why we're multiplying it
by 5-- is equal to 3 times

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.580
5, which is equal to 15.

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:26.330
And so if we add these two
equations, we get x plus 15x

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:34.980
is 16x, 2y plus 5y is 7y, and
5z minus 5z or plus negative 5z,

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:36.810
those are going to cancel out.

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.560
And that is going to
be equal to negative 17

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.430
plus 15 is negative 2.

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.580
So we were able to
use the constraints

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.690
in that equation
and that equation,

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.134
and now we have an
equation in just x and y.

00:01:49.134 --> 00:01:50.550
So let's try to
do the same thing.

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.270
Let's trying to
eliminate the z's.

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.750
But now I'll use this
equation and this equation.

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.130
So this equation-- let me
just rewrite it over here.

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:04.380
We have 2x minus 3y plus
2z is equal to negative 16.

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.750
I just rewrote it.

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.440
And now, so that this
2z gets eliminated,

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.900
let's multiply this
equation times 2.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.560
So let's multiply it times 2,
so we'll have a negative 2z here

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.650
to eliminate with
the positive 2z.

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.920
So 2 times 3x is 6x,
2 times y is plus 2y,

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.750
and then 2 times negative z is
negative 2z is equal to 2 times

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.420
3 is equal to 6.

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.790
And now we can add
these two equations.

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:41.050
2x plus 6x is 8x, negative
3y plus 2y is negative y,

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.570
and then these two
guys get canceled out.

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.690
And then that is
equal to negative 16

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.510
plus 6 is negative 10.

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.100
So now we have two
equations with two unknowns.

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.080
We've eliminated the z's.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.580
And let's see, if we
want to eliminate again,

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.220
we have a negative y over here.

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.190
We have a positive 7y.

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.980
Well, we could eliminate the y's
if we multiplied this times 7

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.250
and add the two equations.

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:07.470
So let's do that.

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.290
So let's multiply this times 7.

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:22.460
7 times 8 is 56, so
it's 56x minus 7y

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:28.440
is equal to 7 times negative
10, is equal to negative 70.

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.530
And now we can add
these two equations.

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.990
I'm now trying to
eliminate the y's.

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:37.230
So we have 16x plus 56x.

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.660
That is 72x.

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.750
So we have 72x, these
guys eliminate, equal

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:50.290
to negative 72, negative
2 plus negative 70.

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:57.155
Divide both sides by 72, and we
get x is equal to negative 1.

00:03:57.155 --> 00:03:58.780
And now we just have
to substitute back

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.110
to figure out what y
and z are equal to.

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.210
So let's go back to this
equation right over here.

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:07.470
So we have 8x minus y
is equal to negative 10.

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.690
If x is equal to negative 1,
that means 8 times negative 1,

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:15.540
or negative 8 minus y
is equal to negative 10.

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.370
We can add 8 to both sides.

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:24.010
And so we have negative
y is equal to negative 2,

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.650
or multiplying both sides by
negative 1, y is equal to 2.

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.380
let me square that off.

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.270
So x is equal to negative
1, y is equal to 2.

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.280
We now just have
to worry about z,

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.570
and we can go back to
any of these up here.

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.280
So I'll just use this last one.

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.230
The numbers seem lower.

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:43.770
So if we substitute back
into this last equation

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.670
right over here,
we have 3 times x,

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:53.930
which is 3 times negative 1
plus y, which is 2, minus z

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:55.420
is equal to 3.

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:59.920
So it's negative 3 plus
2 minus z is equal to 3.

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:06.120
And this is negative 1
minus z is equal to 3.

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:13.050
And then add 1 to both sides,
we get-- these cancel out--

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.310
negative z is equal to 4.

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:18.250
Multiplying both
sides by negative 1,

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:23.600
you get z is equal
to negative 4.

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:24.290
So we're done.

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:27.500
Let's verify that these
solutions, or the solution of x

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:30.540
is negative 1, y is equal to
2, z is equal to negative 4,

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:33.020
actually satisfies all
three of these constraints.

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:35.100
So let's substitute
into this first one.

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:37.190
So you have x plus 2y plus 5z.

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:45.120
So x is negative 1 plus 2
times y, so plus 4, plus 5z.

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:49.580
So minus 20 has to be
equal to negative 17.

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:50.540
And this is negative.

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:52.520
This right here is
positive 3 minus 20

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:54.730
is indeed equal to negative 17.

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:56.552
So it satisfies the
first constraint.

00:05:56.552 --> 00:05:57.760
Let's look at the second one.

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:00.270
2 times x, 2 times negative 1.

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:03.560
That's negative 2
minus 3 times y.

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:09.512
That's minus 6-- 3 times
2 is 6-- plus 2 times z.

00:06:09.512 --> 00:06:13.230
z is negative 4, so that's 2
times negative 4 is negative 8.

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:15.590
That needs to equal negative 16.

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:18.430
Negative 2 minus negative
8 is-- sorry, negative 2

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:20.030
minus negative 6 is negative 8.

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:22.560
Subtract another 8,
you get negative 16.

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.470
So it meets the
second constraint.

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:27.100
And then, finally, let's
look at the last constraint.

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:35.900
We have 3 times x, so negative
3 plus y, so plus 2, minus z.

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:39.760
So minus negative 4 is
the same thing as plus 4.

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:41.550
That needs to be equal to 3.

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:46.340
So negative 3 plus 2 is negative
1 plus 4 is indeed equal to 3.

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:49.330
So we found the point
of intersection in three

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:51.670
dimensions of
these three planes.

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:54.930
x is negative 1, z is
negative 4, y is 2.

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:57.450
And we were able to
verify that it does indeed

00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:59.524
meet all of the constraints.
