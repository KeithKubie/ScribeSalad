00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:02.370
- [Instructor] In the video
on linkage institutions,

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.270
we talk a lot about political parties

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.100
and the various roles that they play

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.490
in the political system.

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.910
In particular, we talk
about how they are involved

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.500
in recruiting candidates.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.420
And as we will talk about in this video,

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:19.980
we'll think about how candidates

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.600
are actually chosen to
represent a political party.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.080
And we also talk about,

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.080
in that video on linkage institutions,

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.610
how political parties are
involved in voter mobilization,

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:33.280
which is a fancy way of saying,

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.930
hey getting people to vote,

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.000
getting people energized
about the election,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.350
to actually get to the polls.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.650
Sometimes going as far as getting buses,

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.930
transporting them to the polling stations.

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.230
And campaign management.

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.250
Campaign

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.430
management.

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.090
And one thing that is really
interesting to appreciate

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.320
and it's really the focus of this video,

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.440
is that both of these things
have evolved over time.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.440
So for example, George Washington,

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:03.610
the first President of the United States,

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.930
he was not affiliated with any party

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.470
and our first two presidential elections

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.820
had no party association.

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.040
But as soon as we get
to the election of 1796,

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.230
we start to see the
development of faction.

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.020
You have Hamilton on one side,

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.980
becomes head of the Federalist Party

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.580
and on the other side,

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.240
headed by Madison,

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.180
you have the Democratic-Republican Party.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.190
Democratic- Republican.

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.860
And there's a nice irony to this

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.520
because it was exactly those two gentlemen

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.220
that not too far before 1796,

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.100
if we go to the late 1780s,

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.710
and their attempt to get
the Constitution ratified

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.210
in the Federalist Papers,

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.470
they argue against faction.

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.810
How faction can be bad for a government,

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.050
for a nation.

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.730
But they were the ones that
led the split into faction

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:59.150
and the split into parties.

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.210
And from that time for over 100 years,

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.560
all the way until we
get to the early 1900s,

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.370
early 1900s,

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:12.610
you have some situations
where the party leadership

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:13.830
might pick candidates

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.020
and some situation where the
party members pick candidates

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.420
and conventions.

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.790
And so you have party leadership,

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.140
leadership slash members

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.070
who gets a hand pick.

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:27.753
Hand pick candidates.

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.500
So this part of the process

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.130
was not so broadly democratic.

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.570
Especially when we get to
the second half of the 1800s.

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.510
You have very strong party leaders,

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.040
often called party bosses.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.520
Who almost had the individual power

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.310
to pick candidates to represent

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.290
one party or another.

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:46.710
But in the early 1900s,

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:47.870
there was a movement to say

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:48.703
hey, you know what?

00:02:48.703 --> 00:02:49.980
This is not so democratic

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.520
to handpick the candidates

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.200
that people have to choose from.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.930
And so this is when you start to have

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.793
the direct primary system.

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.690
Where to choose the candidates

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.790
that represent one party or another,

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.740
you will hold elections.

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.510
And those elections
could be closed primaries

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.640
where you have to be a
registered Republican

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.870
to vote for who represents
Republican party.

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.010
Or registered Democrat

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.210
to see who represents
the Democratic party.

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:17.110
But they also have open primaries

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.520
where anyone could vote
in the Democratic primary

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.630
or anyone could vote in
the Republican primary.

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.260
And this is happening to this day.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.550
Now, this change that has happened

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:29.530
over roughly the last 100 years,

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.040
you could imagine this has changed

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.180
the power dynamic between the parties

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.230
and the candidates.

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.920
For this first over 100 years,

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.510
the party is where a lot of the power was.

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.710
But once you start having
the direct primary,

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:45.933
it becomes a lot more about
candidate centered campaigns.

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.570
Where things become much more about

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:51.300
the position and the
personality of the candidate

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.720
than maybe as much about
the party platform.

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:54.570
And because of that,

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:55.750
it has become more common

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.840
in the last 100 or so years

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.900
where even if someone is
a registered Republican,

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.210
they might vote the other way.

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:02.900
Or if someone is a registered Democrat,

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.150
they might vote the other way

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.510
if a candidate is particularly appealing.

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.330
For example, John F. Kennedy
was the Democratic candidate

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.410
for President in 1960.

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.550
But many Republican Irish
Catholics voted for him.

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:16.440
Similarly, there's a group of folks

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.330
known as the Reagan Democrats.

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:20.630
Who are famous for despite
their party affiliation

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:21.640
with the Democrats,

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.030
voted for President Reagan.

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.190
And that was all around this idea

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:27.940
that it was more about the candidate,

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:29.830
especially at the presidential level

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:32.420
than it is about the party.

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:34.930
Now just as how the
candidate picking process

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:36.370
has evolved over time,

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.037
so has the voter mobilization

00:04:38.037 --> 00:04:40.580
and the campaign management.

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:41.930
In the early days,

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.150
a lot of the voter mobilization,

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.290
in fact, if we think about the late 1800s

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:48.210
where you have this party boss structure,

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.630
you had people sometimes
going so far as even

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:54.600
giving people things
in order to go and vote

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:55.830
for one candidate or another.

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.020
Or exerting some type of pressure.

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:59.090
The late 1800s,

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:00.720
or the second half of the 1800s,

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.540
especially in places like Chicago

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:03.430
and New York

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:05.360
were sometimes infamous for

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.240
not, the necessarily cleanest elections.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.170
But as you get into the 20th century,

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:12.120
especially the second
half of the 20th century,

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.090
and now the 21st century,

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:15.300
things have become much,

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.150
much more sophisticated.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:20.740
So if we go to the 20th century,

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.323
you have significant use of mass media,

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.170
mass media.

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:28.910
And as you go into TV and newspaper,

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:30.940
radio, and newspaper
has always been a factor

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:32.160
in political elections

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.820
going all the way back to the founding

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:34.820
of the United States.

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:37.180
And then as you go into the 21st century,

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:38.810
things have gotten a lot more targeted.

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:41.030
Obviously you can have email campaigns.

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:43.240
You can start to leverage social media.

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.320
And the 21st century in particular,

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.640
things like email
campaigns and social media

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:52.640
has allowed for very
specific targeting to voters.

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:54.920
What do I mean by targeting?

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:58.390
Well, let's say you really
care about economic issues

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:01.320
while your cousin who lives across town

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.030
really cares about social issues.

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:03.960
The same candidate,

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:06.090
instead of sending both
of you the same email,

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:07.720
might send you a targeted message

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.750
that speaks to what you care about.

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:12.050
And this has actually become
very, very sophisticated

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:14.000
in the last few years.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:14.980
I'll leave you there.

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:16.280
But the big takeaway here

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:18.630
is political parties have been around

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:21.450
for a while in the United States.

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:23.490
But they have been evolving.

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:24.323
In this video,

00:06:24.323 --> 00:06:26.920
I'm not even talking
about how their platforms

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:27.753
have evolved.

00:06:27.753 --> 00:06:29.710
And how their associations have evolved.

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:31.700
But this is talking about
how they have evolved

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:33.100
in terms of picking candidates.

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:35.340
And how that has changed
the nature of campaigns.

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:38.240
And also, how primarily
through the changes

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.440
in culture and the changes in technology,

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:41.990
how they can go about mobilizing

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:45.143
and managing campaigns has also changed.
