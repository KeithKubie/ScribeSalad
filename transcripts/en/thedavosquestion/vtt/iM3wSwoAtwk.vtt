I'm Aron Cramer, President and CEO of BSR.
We're a network of companies in which we advise

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:15.389
unsustainability. And I think that actually
geo political issues and economic issues are

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:21.680
very interchangeably linked. In fact, as we
look ahead this year, we will see how governments

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:27.560
and also businesses are looking to solve the
economic issue, come up with an international

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:33.329
agreement on economic. And also deal with
the issues of food and water security in addition

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:40.789
to energy security. So the success on economic
issues will undoubtedly also help to build

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:42.489
better understanding and avoid geo political
tensions.
