Everything that we've drawn so far was in black. Now, black is a marvelous

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:07.820
color, but what if you'd like another one, such as one of these? These colors

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:11.780
have predefined names, and when you look here, you can see that every color is

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.430
a mixture of a red, green, and blue component. Red has only red, and no green

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.320
and blue. Blue has only blue and no red and green. Yellow has red and green,

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.050
and no blue. You can make other mixtures, and you'll explore that in the

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.600
exercises that are going to be coming up right now, let's just stick with red.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.850
Let's say we have a rectangle that we want to draw in red. You set the color to

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.320
the color constant red in this way, and then when you draw it, it shows up in

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.730
red. Alternatively, you can call the fill method, and then the interior's also

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.860
drawn in red. Now you know everything about the graphics library to make fancy

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.210
drawings on your own. Go ahead and do the practice assignments with Sara. And

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.350
when you're done, maybe you'll be motivated to recreate Udacity train. Or

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.280
create a fancy drawing of your own and share it with us on the discussion

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:58.719
group.
