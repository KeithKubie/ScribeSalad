[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.400
Us human beings are such
ambitious creatures.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.210
We dream of cosmic expansion.

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.470
We dream to soar the
heavens, to transcend

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.250
the biological
shackles that limit us.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.660
I think one of the most
interesting ways in which we

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.320
rehearse our own ambitions
is through the use

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.200
of metaphorical entities.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.570
Greek and Roman gods
being the best example.

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.270
This is a way for us to
safely idealize ourselves.

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:55.510
This is where we can, without
censorship, aspire to be.

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.760
And of course, by
labeling them, gods, we

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.080
don't have to admit that it's
really us who long for those

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.209
attributes and qualities of
omniscience and omnipotence.

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:10.030
Whether it's Bacchus, the Roman
god of wine and intoxication.

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.630
Or Morpheus, the god of dreams.

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.340
Or Prometheus, who stole
the fire from the gods.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.850
Or Adam, who bit from the
apple, the Tree of Knowledge.

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.730
I mean when you look at computer
companies-- like Apple-- that

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:27.940
is the reflection of
that Promethean spirit,

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:29.240
of stealing fire from the gods.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.220
All the world's
knowledge and information

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.120
stored in the Google database.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.220
The literalization
of our dream--

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.740
our psychedelic Promethean
dream of mind expansion.

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:44.470
To be as gods-- having invented
the gods we can turn into them.

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.720
This is the human yearning.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.380
This is what we want.

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:49.830
We should just come out of it.

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.590
Admit it to ourselves
already and go

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.420
about actualizing this
potentiality within us.

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.810
To free the brave, reckless,
gods within us all.

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.360
