00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869
world we need to look at this critically
 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.430

reason I'm even allowed to go to Israel

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.050
reason I'm even allowed to go to Israel
 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:39.330
reason I'm even allowed to go to Israel
is because I have an American passport

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:39.340
is because I have an American passport
 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.880
is because I have an American passport
and I'm lucky enough to have an American

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:41.890
and I'm lucky enough to have an American
 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:43.380
and I'm lucky enough to have an American
passport because my grandfather came

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:43.390
passport because my grandfather came
 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.720
passport because my grandfather came
here in 1911 and then or whatever year

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:45.730
here in 1911 and then or whatever year
 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:48.630
here in 1911 and then or whatever year
and went back to Palestine and that's

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:48.640
and went back to Palestine and that's
 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.549
and went back to Palestine and that's
how my father was able to come here if I

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:50.559
how my father was able to come here if I
 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:52.650
how my father was able to come here if I
didn't have an American passport I don't

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:52.660
didn't have an American passport I don't
 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.990
didn't have an American passport I don't

the country where my father was born and

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.160
the country where my father was born and
 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.069

that's what it's about what the solution
 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.170
that's what it's about what the solution
is I'm not really sure I have I have a

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.180
is I'm not really sure I have I have a

no Jewish state but um I don't know the

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170
no Jewish state but um I don't know the

the first thing that really gets me at

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130
the first thing that really gets me at
 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:21.409
the first thing that really gets me at
that when people say it's been going on

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419
that when people say it's been going on
 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:23.120
that when people say it's been going on
for centuries since the Bible since the

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130
for centuries since the Bible since the
 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:24.800
for centuries since the Bible since the
Bible it's not the reality this is a

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810
Bible it's not the reality this is a
 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.430
Bible it's not the reality this is a
modern political phenomenon that we need

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440
modern political phenomenon that we need
 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.400

to all

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410
to all
 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:34.189
to all
look at and see and see the realities of

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:34.199
look at and see and see the realities of
 

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:36.379
look at and see and see the realities of
what is going on and why it's going on

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:36.389
what is going on and why it's going on
 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:39.350
what is going on and why it's going on
and and so I think that for me I find it

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360
and and so I think that for me I find it
 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.980

really frustrating when people say that

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:41.990
really frustrating when people say that
 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.779
