00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:01.589
- That is awesomely good.

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:04.213
It is very tender and
you can really taste that

00:00:04.213 --> 00:00:06.713
really reduced red wine sauce.

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:24.142
Good morning everyone.

00:00:24.142 --> 00:00:27.941
It's Mark Wiens with
migrationology.com in New York City.

00:00:27.941 --> 00:00:30.031
Last night I had a little bit of a dream

00:00:30.031 --> 00:00:31.750
about that coffee in the fridge.

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.243
So I just woke up, I'm
gonna start with the coffee.

00:00:35.243 --> 00:00:38.800
I don't have a bottle opener,
but I do have a spoon.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.633
Let's see if I can do
this, it's been a while.

00:00:43.751 --> 00:00:45.918
Oh yeah. Alright, success.

00:00:52.184 --> 00:00:54.316
I think it's a very light
roast which I really like

00:00:54.316 --> 00:00:56.140
because you can taste the full body,

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:57.612
the full flavor of the coffee

00:00:57.612 --> 00:01:01.779
and it is kind of like a roasted
caramel brown color to it,

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.717
and very aromatic as soon as I popped

00:01:05.717 --> 00:01:07.717
that lid on that bottle.

00:01:10.175 --> 00:01:13.592
Smells kind of like, a little bit fruity.

00:01:20.268 --> 00:01:21.935
Oh that tastes good.

00:01:23.128 --> 00:01:27.211
It's kind of earthy
actually, rather than fruity.

00:01:30.348 --> 00:01:33.075
The more I sit here and
keep drinking this coffee,

00:01:33.075 --> 00:01:34.628
it just keeps getting better and better.

00:01:34.628 --> 00:01:38.279
The complexity and I
keep tasting new flavors.

00:01:38.279 --> 00:01:41.353
It's amazing, and it's so smooth

00:01:41.353 --> 00:01:44.847
and it really is just like coffee juice,

00:01:44.847 --> 00:01:47.126
the nectar, this cold brew.

00:01:47.126 --> 00:01:48.777
Wow it's good.

00:01:48.777 --> 00:01:52.235
Goodbye New York City,
this is an awesome view.

00:01:52.235 --> 00:01:55.469
And thank you very much to
Courtyard Marriott Chelsea.

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:58.849
We've had a fantastic stay,
staff are awesome here

00:01:58.849 --> 00:02:01.501
and this is literally a prime location,

00:02:01.501 --> 00:02:03.494
right around the corner from Penn Station.

00:02:03.494 --> 00:02:07.661
A great place to stay when
you're in New York City.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.270
It's time to move on to
the next destination.

00:02:25.419 --> 00:02:29.336
We have come to my final
bite in New York City.

00:02:30.251 --> 00:02:31.883
I'm gonna make it happen right over there

00:02:31.883 --> 00:02:36.050
on the street corner just
outside of Pennsylvania Station.

00:02:37.423 --> 00:02:41.159
I just came to thinking, I
have not had a hot dog yet

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:42.576
in New York City.

00:02:52.584 --> 00:02:55.619
I ordered a hot dog, got everything on it,

00:02:55.619 --> 00:02:59.093
and this a halal cart so
it's a 100% beef hot dog,

00:02:59.093 --> 00:03:01.644
and I got all the toppings,
put on some sauerkraut,

00:03:01.644 --> 00:03:03.433
some ketchup and mustard.

00:03:03.433 --> 00:03:05.068
And it's a boiled hot dog as well.

00:03:05.068 --> 00:03:08.318
I saw him pull it out of the hot water.

00:03:17.907 --> 00:03:19.363
Simple and classic.

00:03:19.363 --> 00:03:23.740
Hot dog, the bread, the
little bit of spicy mustard,

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:25.755
and then that sauerkraut to give it

00:03:25.755 --> 00:03:27.724
a little bit of a fresh crispness.

00:03:27.724 --> 00:03:30.801
The hot dog is okay, but what
I love is this atmosphere,

00:03:30.801 --> 00:03:34.335
right here in Madison Square
Garden, buildings surrounding.

00:03:34.335 --> 00:03:37.156
There are lots of people
and what I love so much

00:03:37.156 --> 00:03:40.786
about New York City is just
the incredible diversity.

00:03:40.786 --> 00:03:42.960
People from all walks of life.

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:47.036
From every culture to the
farthest corners of the globe.

00:03:47.036 --> 00:03:49.383
You hear different
languages standing here,

00:03:49.383 --> 00:03:52.967
you see different cultural
traditions standing here.

00:03:52.967 --> 00:03:57.050
I think that's really what
sums up New York City.

00:04:06.883 --> 00:04:09.137
We bought our tickets and
again we are flying out of

00:04:09.137 --> 00:04:11.084
Newark International Airport.

00:04:11.084 --> 00:04:15.251
Have about a 20 minute wait
until the next train leaves.

00:04:28.014 --> 00:04:30.181
We made it to the airport.

00:04:31.771 --> 00:04:34.662
We are flying with United
from Newark to Hong Kong.

00:04:34.662 --> 00:04:37.569
This is gonna be by far the longest flight

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:39.940
on this entire round
the world trip for food.

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.440
I think it's about 16
hours on this flight.

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.608
And if you're just
joining me on this video

00:04:45.608 --> 00:04:48.140
I wanted to just really
quickly fill you in.

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:50.528
Right now my wife Ying and I are on a trip

00:04:50.528 --> 00:04:51.660
with Star Alliance,

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.120
a round the world trip for food.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.259
We are traveling to a total of
nine different destinations.

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:00.270
We started in Bangkok,
so that's 10 destination

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:02.224
if you count our home base in Bangkok,

00:05:02.224 --> 00:05:05.552
and we're traveling around
with the specific purpose

00:05:05.552 --> 00:05:08.087
of eating delicious food.

00:05:08.087 --> 00:05:10.700
So this is, it's hard to believe actually

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:14.347
that we're coming to the
end of the trip right now.

00:05:14.347 --> 00:05:16.759
We are gonna fly to Hong Kong

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:18.955
and then be in Hong Kong
for a couple of days,

00:05:18.955 --> 00:05:20.065
then we'll fly back to Bangkok

00:05:20.065 --> 00:05:22.729
and that will complete the entire circle,

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:26.253
the entire trip around the
world with Star Alliance.

00:05:26.253 --> 00:05:29.475
If you haven't already watched
the entire video series

00:05:29.475 --> 00:05:31.520
they will be in a full playlist

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.516
which I will leave the link
in the description box below.

00:05:34.516 --> 00:05:37.278
You can watch all of the
videos in consecutive order

00:05:37.278 --> 00:05:40.471
and follow this entire trip
round the world for food.

00:05:40.471 --> 00:05:42.641
On our way to Hong Kong, and again

00:05:42.641 --> 00:05:44.974
we're flying business class.

00:05:47.443 --> 00:05:50.610
Starting off with a welcome champagne.

00:05:54.099 --> 00:05:56.878
And this is one flight
that I am looking forward

00:05:56.878 --> 00:06:01.594
to all 16 hours of, are
you looking at the menu?

00:06:01.594 --> 00:06:03.261
Hello. No thank you.

00:06:05.277 --> 00:06:07.490
What's on the menu Ying?

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:09.490
- Beef, stir fry noodle,

00:06:12.257 --> 00:06:14.174
salmon.
- Oh short rib.

00:06:15.067 --> 00:06:16.532
Short rib or salmon.

00:06:16.532 --> 00:06:19.614
The short rib sounds fantastic.

00:06:19.614 --> 00:06:23.364
(pilot speaking on intercom)

00:06:53.211 --> 00:06:55.314
We are about 30 minutes into this flight

00:06:55.314 --> 00:06:57.260
and it is time for lunch.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.995
On the menu this says
this is Balik style salmon

00:06:59.995 --> 00:07:02.294
with remoulade sauce.

00:07:02.294 --> 00:07:06.408
And wow that is a pretty
thick, hearty slice of salmon

00:07:06.408 --> 00:07:10.232
and there are maybe sun
dried tomatoes in the middle?

00:07:10.232 --> 00:07:12.696
Is that one slice of salmon?

00:07:12.696 --> 00:07:14.029
Oh that is huge.

00:07:20.361 --> 00:07:24.898
Oh it's so soft and tender and
buttery, just creamy, oily.

00:07:24.898 --> 00:07:28.481
And there's also some
kind of a sauce here.

00:07:33.267 --> 00:07:37.802
It's like a little bit of a
horseradish kind of sauce.

00:07:37.802 --> 00:07:41.875
And that is just such
a huge chunk of salmon.

00:07:41.875 --> 00:07:46.042
That salmon is so tender, you
can cut it with your fork.

00:07:52.199 --> 00:07:54.209
The meal is served course by course

00:07:54.209 --> 00:07:56.079
so it is salad course now,

00:07:56.079 --> 00:07:59.746
and I got the balsamic
vinaigrette dressing.

00:08:07.234 --> 00:08:09.859
Thank you.
- And for you anything else?

00:08:09.859 --> 00:08:14.026
Ma'am, anything else?
- We're good, thank you.

00:08:14.026 --> 00:08:17.322
For main course I got the
short rib with red wine sauce,

00:08:17.322 --> 00:08:19.360
and then it came with mashed
potatoes, and carrots,

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:22.086
and green beans, and a tomato.

00:08:22.086 --> 00:08:23.746
Oh that's so tender.

00:08:23.746 --> 00:08:26.079
Get a close-up look at that.

00:08:31.684 --> 00:08:32.907
That is awesomely good.

00:08:32.907 --> 00:08:35.186
It is very tender and you can really taste

00:08:35.186 --> 00:08:38.103
that really reduced red wine sauce.

00:08:53.197 --> 00:08:54.603
That is seriously good.

00:08:54.603 --> 00:08:56.805
What I will do is take the pepper

00:08:56.805 --> 00:08:59.305
and sprinkle it on generously.

00:09:05.208 --> 00:09:08.328
Next up, this is the pre-dessert snacks.

00:09:08.328 --> 00:09:11.739
Cheese and grapes and crackers.

00:09:11.739 --> 00:09:15.345
Okay, let me start off
with this cheese here.

00:09:15.345 --> 00:09:18.678
Oh that is a very crumbly, oh thank you.

00:09:19.731 --> 00:09:22.648
That is a very crumbly, dry cheese.

00:09:26.919 --> 00:09:29.463
I think it's a goat cheese.

00:09:29.463 --> 00:09:33.463
It does have a very kind
of animaly taste to it.

00:09:34.332 --> 00:09:35.706
It's like cream cheese, though.

00:09:35.706 --> 00:09:38.623
That has to be followed by a grape.

00:09:42.511 --> 00:09:45.993
The immediate juicy
sweetness of that grape.

00:09:45.993 --> 00:09:48.663
And finally, the last course
of this meal is dessert,

00:09:48.663 --> 00:09:50.315
and it is gelato.

00:09:50.315 --> 00:09:52.717
And Ying and I decided to share one,

00:09:52.717 --> 00:09:56.615
and Jean really hooked up the
chocolate sauce, the fudge.

00:09:56.615 --> 00:10:00.115
She just poured it all over the ice cream.

00:10:05.025 --> 00:10:09.192
That is sweet, and then I
also got a cup of tea here.

00:10:13.304 --> 00:10:16.387
And that completes this gourmet meal.

00:10:42.538 --> 00:10:44.460
I just woke up, it's
about an hour and a half

00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:47.745
until we land in Hong Kong and
it's time for breakfast now,

00:10:47.745 --> 00:10:49.662
starting with a coffee.

00:10:53.344 --> 00:10:55.578
And sorry about the bed head.

00:10:55.578 --> 00:10:57.001
Actually I'm not really sorry.

00:10:57.001 --> 00:11:00.099
And for my main course for
breakfast I chose the omelette.

00:11:00.099 --> 00:11:02.050
Came with some herbed sausage,

00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:04.046
and you can really see all of the spices

00:11:04.046 --> 00:11:05.221
within that sausage.

00:11:05.221 --> 00:11:08.581
There's potatoes here and
also maybe some kind of,

00:11:08.581 --> 00:11:09.802
what's the orange thing?

00:11:09.802 --> 00:11:11.530
Pumpkin or squash or something?

00:11:11.530 --> 00:11:13.629
I'll go with the spoon for this.

00:11:13.629 --> 00:11:17.462
All of a sudden there's
a bunch of turbulence.

00:11:19.176 --> 00:11:22.519
I gotta start with that herb sausage.

00:11:22.519 --> 00:11:24.936
Whoa, this is a shaky camera.

00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:35.046
Full of like, herbs and
tastes like apple as well.

00:11:35.046 --> 00:11:36.129
And omelette.

00:11:38.503 --> 00:11:42.670
Is that cheese and also maybe
some black beans in here.

00:11:44.479 --> 00:11:47.008
I think that's like a creamy, cheesy sauce

00:11:47.008 --> 00:11:49.841
actually underneath that omelette.

00:12:07.361 --> 00:12:09.051
[Pilot Speaking On Intercom]
Ladies and gentlemen

00:12:09.051 --> 00:12:11.328
United and our Star
Alliance partners and our

00:12:11.328 --> 00:12:13.500
international flight crew welcome you

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:15.457
to Hong Kong International Airport.

00:12:15.457 --> 00:12:19.363
The local time is approximately 7:18pm

00:12:19.363 --> 00:12:20.974
- [Flight Attendant]
Where do you go from here?

00:12:20.974 --> 00:12:23.206
- Bangkok. That's where we're from.

00:12:23.206 --> 00:12:26.373
My wife is from. Congratulations, bye.

00:12:29.856 --> 00:12:32.439
Two meals, three movies,

00:12:32.439 --> 00:12:34.999
and about six hours of on and off sleep,

00:12:34.999 --> 00:12:37.037
and we have arrived in Hong Kong.

00:12:37.037 --> 00:12:38.620
It's about 7:30 pm.

00:12:42.112 --> 00:12:43.269
We're waiting for our bag
now but I just wanted to say

00:12:43.269 --> 00:12:45.949
thank you to United Airlines,

00:12:45.949 --> 00:12:49.216
and especially to Jean
and Anna and the captain

00:12:49.216 --> 00:12:50.534
and the whole crew of that airline.

00:12:50.534 --> 00:12:54.050
They really took care of us that flight.

00:12:54.050 --> 00:12:55.380
- [Taxi Driver] Where are you going to?

00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:56.641
- [Mark] JW Marriott.

00:12:56.641 --> 00:12:58.974
- [Taxi Driver] Okay, hello.

00:13:00.974 --> 00:13:02.687
- When you arrive in Hong Kong,

00:13:02.687 --> 00:13:04.461
there's a very convenient train,

00:13:04.461 --> 00:13:06.148
or I've also taken the bus before

00:13:06.148 --> 00:13:07.321
from the airport to the town.

00:13:07.321 --> 00:13:09.517
But Ying is not feeling
very well right now

00:13:09.517 --> 00:13:13.196
so we decided to take a
taxi directly to our hotel.

00:13:13.196 --> 00:13:16.029
But it's great to be in Hong Kong.

00:13:48.829 --> 00:13:50.373
Okay thank you very much.

00:13:50.373 --> 00:13:51.698
- [Hotel Attendee] Have
a wonderful stay with us.

00:13:51.698 --> 00:13:53.093
- Thank you.

00:13:53.093 --> 00:13:55.343
(cheering)

00:13:58.378 --> 00:13:59.887
- Ying is pretty happy
to be at this hotel.

00:13:59.887 --> 00:14:01.811
We're staying at JW Marriott.

00:14:01.811 --> 00:14:03.388
We got all checked in,

00:14:03.388 --> 00:14:05.683
and she was just going over our benefits.

00:14:05.683 --> 00:14:09.954
We have breakfast, afternoon
tea, cocktails, hors d'oeuvres,

00:14:09.954 --> 00:14:13.244
evening snacks, and other
refreshments all day long.

00:14:13.244 --> 00:14:15.552
It's like all you can eat, all day long,

00:14:15.552 --> 00:14:18.765
in this hotel, and we are
going up to our room right now.

00:14:18.765 --> 00:14:20.541
What floor are we on?

00:14:20.541 --> 00:14:22.255
Oh I gotta clear my ears.

00:14:22.255 --> 00:14:24.328
We're on the 35th floor.

00:14:24.328 --> 00:14:26.614
This is a nice hotel.

00:14:26.614 --> 00:14:27.447
Alright.

00:14:28.825 --> 00:14:30.658
On, oh is this the AC.

00:14:36.224 --> 00:14:38.238
Let's take a quick tour of the room.

00:14:38.238 --> 00:14:40.298
Have the bed right in the center there.

00:14:40.298 --> 00:14:44.547
Oh Ying is already hanging
out on that sofa chair.

00:14:44.547 --> 00:14:46.794
Desk on the side here.

00:14:46.794 --> 00:14:50.214
And this is like a corner,
do we have the corner room?

00:14:50.214 --> 00:14:52.041
Or we at least have a corner window.

00:14:52.041 --> 00:14:55.094
There's a little bit of a
glare on the window right now.

00:14:55.094 --> 00:14:57.321
Oh yeah, but if you look close,

00:14:57.321 --> 00:14:58.778
I'm not sure if you can see.

00:14:58.778 --> 00:15:01.738
No, probably not picking up on the camera,

00:15:01.738 --> 00:15:02.908
oh there we go.

00:15:02.908 --> 00:15:05.404
You can see that view.

00:15:05.404 --> 00:15:06.899
I'm sure tomorrow morning we'll have

00:15:06.899 --> 00:15:09.744
a better view in the daylight.

00:15:09.744 --> 00:15:12.485
And now over to the bathroom.

00:15:12.485 --> 00:15:15.919
Oh by the way, the drink station, water,

00:15:15.919 --> 00:15:20.794
coffee maker, water boiler,
and bathroom in here.

00:15:20.794 --> 00:15:23.961
Every kind of bathroom thing you need.

00:15:24.816 --> 00:15:26.316
Toilet is here.

00:15:26.316 --> 00:15:30.114
And shower, both a shower, and a tub.

00:15:30.114 --> 00:15:32.446
And that completes the tour of the room.

00:15:32.446 --> 00:15:34.083
This is a really nice room.

00:15:34.083 --> 00:15:35.650
I've been to Hong Kong a number of times

00:15:35.650 --> 00:15:37.774
so this isn't my first
time to Hong Kong but

00:15:37.774 --> 00:15:41.199
Hong Kong remains one of my
favorite cities in the world.

00:15:41.199 --> 00:15:43.396
It's just an amazing city.

00:15:43.396 --> 00:15:47.563
The buildings, the architecture,
the food is awesome

00:15:48.427 --> 00:15:52.203
and so for the next four days
we're gonna be in Hong Kong.

00:15:52.203 --> 00:15:55.522
It's hard to believe that
this is our final destination

00:15:55.522 --> 00:15:58.645
on this round the world trip
for food with Star Alliance.

00:15:58.645 --> 00:16:01.249
But happy to be in Hong Kong.

00:16:01.249 --> 00:16:03.024
It's been a long day.

00:16:03.024 --> 00:16:05.687
Ying and I are both a
little disoriented right now

00:16:05.687 --> 00:16:08.524
but it is around 9 pm in Hong Kong so

00:16:08.524 --> 00:16:11.823
I don't think we'll do
anything for tonight.

00:16:11.823 --> 00:16:14.011
We're gonna go to bed pretty soon.

00:16:14.011 --> 00:16:15.850
I'm gonna end the vlog
for today right now.

00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:18.267
