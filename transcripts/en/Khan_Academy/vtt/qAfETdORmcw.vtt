00:00:00.306 --> 00:00:02.187
- [Voiceover] Let f of x
equal negative x squared

00:00:02.187 --> 00:00:03.406
plus a x plus b

00:00:03.406 --> 00:00:05.461
over x squared plus c x plus d

00:00:05.461 --> 00:00:09.582
where a, b, c, and d
are unknown constants.

00:00:09.582 --> 00:00:12.043
Which of the following is a possible graph

00:00:12.043 --> 00:00:14.400
of y is equal to f of x?

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.105
And they told us dashed
lines indicate asymptotes.

00:00:17.105 --> 00:00:19.043
So this is really interesting here.

00:00:19.043 --> 00:00:20.301
And they gave us four choices.

00:00:20.301 --> 00:00:22.391
We see four of them,
three of them right now.

00:00:22.391 --> 00:00:24.190
Then if I scroll over bit over,

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:25.955
you can see choice D.

00:00:25.955 --> 00:00:27.662
And so I encourage you to pause the video

00:00:27.662 --> 00:00:29.461
and think about how we can figure it out

00:00:29.461 --> 00:00:30.378
because it is interesting

00:00:30.378 --> 00:00:32.131
because they haven't
given us a lot of details.

00:00:32.131 --> 00:00:34.197
They haven't given us
what these coefficients

00:00:34.197 --> 00:00:36.833
or these constants are going to be.

00:00:36.833 --> 00:00:38.191
All right, now let's think about it.

00:00:38.191 --> 00:00:39.454
So one thing we could think about is

00:00:39.454 --> 00:00:40.830
horizontal asymptotes.

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.064
So let's think about what happens

00:00:42.064 --> 00:00:45.007
as x approaches positive
or negative infinity.

00:00:45.007 --> 00:00:49.302
Well, as x, so as x approaches

00:00:49.302 --> 00:00:53.232
infinity or x approaches

00:00:53.232 --> 00:00:56.232
negative infinity, f of x.

00:00:56.232 --> 00:01:00.456
F of x is going to be
approximately equal to.

00:01:00.456 --> 00:01:02.172
Well, we're going to look
at the highest degree terms

00:01:02.172 --> 00:01:03.832
because these are going to dominate

00:01:03.832 --> 00:01:05.759
as the magnitude of x,

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:08.534
the absolute value of
x becomes very large.

00:01:08.534 --> 00:01:12.353
So f of x is going to be
approximately negative x squared

00:01:12.353 --> 00:01:16.997
over x squared which is equal to negative

00:01:16.997 --> 00:01:18.332
or we could another way to think about it.

00:01:18.332 --> 00:01:20.398
This is the same thing as negative one.

00:01:20.398 --> 00:01:24.578
So f of x is going to approach,

00:01:24.578 --> 00:01:28.162
f of x is going to approach negative one.

00:01:28.162 --> 00:01:30.542
In either direction, as
x approaches infinity

00:01:30.542 --> 00:01:32.422
or x approaches negative infinity.

00:01:32.422 --> 00:01:34.477
So we have a horizontal asymptote

00:01:34.477 --> 00:01:37.267
at y equals negative one.

00:01:37.267 --> 00:01:39.103
Let's see, choice A here,

00:01:39.103 --> 00:01:41.779
it does look like they
have a horizontal asymptote

00:01:41.779 --> 00:01:45.252
at y is equal to negative one

00:01:45.252 --> 00:01:46.425
right over there.

00:01:46.425 --> 00:01:47.992
And we can verify that

00:01:47.992 --> 00:01:51.451
because each hash mark is two.

00:01:51.451 --> 00:01:52.786
We go from two to zero

00:01:52.786 --> 00:01:54.992
to negative two to negative four.

00:01:54.992 --> 00:01:57.302
So this does look like
it's a negative one.

00:01:57.302 --> 00:02:00.007
So just based only on
the horizontal asymptote,

00:02:00.007 --> 00:02:02.004
choice A looks good.

00:02:02.004 --> 00:02:05.382
Choice B, we have a horizontal asymptote

00:02:05.382 --> 00:02:08.110
at y is equal to positive two.

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.262
So we can rule that out.

00:02:11.262 --> 00:02:12.905
We know that a horizontal asymptote

00:02:12.905 --> 00:02:15.761
as x approaches positive
or negative infinity

00:02:15.761 --> 00:02:17.445
is at negative one,

00:02:17.445 --> 00:02:19.082
y equals negative one.

00:02:19.082 --> 00:02:21.241
Here, our horizontal asymptote is

00:02:21.241 --> 00:02:23.121
at y is equal to zero.

00:02:23.121 --> 00:02:24.805
The graph approaches,

00:02:24.805 --> 00:02:27.277
it approaches the x axis

00:02:27.277 --> 00:02:29.263
from either above or below.

00:02:29.263 --> 00:02:30.702
So it's not the horizontal asymptote.

00:02:30.702 --> 00:02:32.420
It's not y equals negative one.

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.661
So we can rule that one out.

00:02:34.661 --> 00:02:37.424
And then similarly, over here,

00:02:37.424 --> 00:02:39.920
our horizontal asymptote is
not y equals negative one.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.300
Our horizontal asymptote
is y is equal to zero

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.343
so we can rule that one out.

00:02:44.343 --> 00:02:45.341
And that makes sense

00:02:45.341 --> 00:02:47.837
because really they only
gave us enough information

00:02:47.837 --> 00:02:50.124
to figure out the horizontal asymptote.

00:02:50.124 --> 00:02:51.900
They didn't give us enough information

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.142
to figure out how many roots

00:02:53.142 --> 00:02:54.535
or what happens in the interval

00:02:54.535 --> 00:02:55.673
and all of those types of things.

00:02:55.673 --> 00:02:57.298
How many zeros and all that

00:02:57.298 --> 00:03:00.917
because we don't know what the actual

00:03:00.917 --> 00:03:03.161
coefficients or constants
of the quadratic are.

00:03:03.161 --> 00:03:07.530
All we know is what happens as
the x squared terms dominate.

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.441
This thing is going to
approach negative one.

00:03:10.441 --> 00:03:14.430
And so we picked choice A.
