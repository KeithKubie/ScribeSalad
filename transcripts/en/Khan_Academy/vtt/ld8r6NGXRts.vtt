00:00:00.254 --> 00:00:02.234
- [Voiceover] Hello
Grammarians. Hello Paige.

00:00:02.234 --> 00:00:03.067
- [Paige] Hi, David.

00:00:03.067 --> 00:00:05.408
- [Dave] So we have
three different sentence

00:00:05.408 --> 00:00:07.295
varieties that we're
going to talk about today.

00:00:07.295 --> 00:00:08.878
- [Paige] Okay.

00:00:08.878 --> 00:00:10.556
- [Dave] Here are their three flavors.

00:00:10.556 --> 00:00:13.973
Flavor number one, declarative sentences.

00:00:16.022 --> 00:00:19.605
Flavor number two,
interrogative sentences.

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.103
And flavor number three,
imperative sentences.

00:00:29.092 --> 00:00:32.124
Those are all pretty
long and wibbly words.

00:00:32.124 --> 00:00:32.957
- [Paige] Seriously.

00:00:32.957 --> 00:00:36.856
- [Dave] But we will address
each one of them in turn.

00:00:36.856 --> 00:00:40.599
Paige, if you please, what
is a declarative sentence?

00:00:40.599 --> 00:00:42.026
- [Paige] A declarative sentence is a type

00:00:42.026 --> 00:00:46.193
of sentence that just
states a fact or an opinion,

00:00:47.233 --> 00:00:50.650
I suppose, but it just makes a statement.

00:00:52.143 --> 00:00:53.992
So that would be something like

00:00:53.992 --> 00:00:55.825
it is a beautiful day.

00:00:57.811 --> 00:00:59.906
- [Dave] It is a beautiful day, Paige.

00:00:59.906 --> 00:01:01.922
We can also use declarative sentences

00:01:01.922 --> 00:01:05.188
to get across any kind of information.

00:01:05.188 --> 00:01:07.537
This is what we call
exposition in writing.

00:01:07.537 --> 00:01:08.461
- [Paige] Righ. Yeah.

00:01:08.461 --> 00:01:12.261
- [Dave] So we can say
Lavender hated baseball.

00:01:12.261 --> 00:01:14.721
You know, you could start
a short story with that.

00:01:14.721 --> 00:01:16.254
- [Paige] Right, that's-
- [Dave] I challenge you to.

00:01:16.254 --> 00:01:18.279
- [Paige] Just a fact about Lavender.

00:01:18.279 --> 00:01:19.953
- [Dave] That's a fact about Lavender.

00:01:19.953 --> 00:01:22.448
So a declarative sentence is a statement.

00:01:22.448 --> 00:01:23.446
Just straight up.

00:01:23.446 --> 00:01:24.443
- [Paige] Yep.

00:01:24.443 --> 00:01:28.242
- [Dave] An interrogative
sentence is a question.

00:01:28.242 --> 00:01:30.827
So it asks a question.

00:01:30.827 --> 00:01:32.392
- [Paige] It's just a
fancy word for a question.

00:01:32.392 --> 00:01:33.618
- [Dave] Right.
- [Paige] Okay.

00:01:33.618 --> 00:01:36.514
- [Dave] So an example of
an interrogative sentence

00:01:36.514 --> 00:01:38.994
would be where did you go last night?

00:01:38.994 --> 00:01:41.136
- [Paige] Right.

00:01:41.136 --> 00:01:43.392
- [Dave] Or how is he
still singing that note?

00:01:43.392 --> 00:01:44.225
- [Paige] I have no idea.

00:01:44.225 --> 00:01:45.906
- [Dave] Incredible breath control

00:01:45.906 --> 00:01:48.222
So that's what an
interrogative question is.

00:01:48.222 --> 00:01:49.055
- [Paige] Right.

00:01:49.055 --> 00:01:50.494
It's like being interrogated.

00:01:50.494 --> 00:01:52.413
That's, like, a similar
word to interrogative,

00:01:52.413 --> 00:01:54.942
is just having a lot of questions asked.

00:01:54.942 --> 00:01:56.184
- [Dave] Like really aggressively.

00:01:56.184 --> 00:01:57.974
- [Paige] Yeah, it's not
a very positive thing.

00:01:57.974 --> 00:01:59.351
- [Dave] Paige, what did
you do with the cheese?

00:01:59.351 --> 00:02:00.184
- [Paige] I don't know. (laughs)

00:02:00.184 --> 00:02:01.597
- [Dave] Paige, why are you
still eating the cheese?

00:02:01.597 --> 00:02:02.430
- [Paige] I'm not.

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.919
- [Dave] Paige, I know
you stole the cheese.

00:02:03.919 --> 00:02:05.460
Finally, the third kind of sentence

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.952
we want to talk about
today is the imperative.

00:02:08.952 --> 00:02:11.202
An imperative is a command.

00:02:12.124 --> 00:02:14.828
- [Paige] Right, so when you
tell someone to do something.

00:02:14.828 --> 00:02:18.897
- [Dave] So a command like,
Paige, follow that bunny!

00:02:18.897 --> 00:02:20.597
(laughs)

00:02:20.597 --> 00:02:22.055
- [Paige] And the bunny stole the cheese.

00:02:22.055 --> 00:02:22.888
- [Dave] Yeah.

00:02:22.888 --> 00:02:25.051
So this is one of those
sentences that doesn't

00:02:25.051 --> 00:02:29.342
have a subject that is
literally spoken out loud.

00:02:29.342 --> 00:02:30.829
- [Paige] Right, it's just implied.

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:33.824
You know, if you're saying that to me,

00:02:33.824 --> 00:02:35.217
I know that I am the subject.

00:02:35.217 --> 00:02:37.585
- [Dave] Right. So it's
you follow that bunny.

00:02:37.585 --> 00:02:38.418
- [Paige] Right.

00:02:38.418 --> 00:02:40.538
- [Dave] But the you is just not spoken.

00:02:40.538 --> 00:02:43.439
Or, if you're not into
bunny following, you know,

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:45.719
something like remember
to wash the dishes,

00:02:45.719 --> 00:02:48.168
you're still being commanded to remember.

00:02:48.168 --> 00:02:49.462
- [Paige] Yeah, yeah.

00:02:49.462 --> 00:02:51.229
- [Dave] So, yeah,
that's our, those are our

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:52.867
three sentence types.

00:02:52.867 --> 00:02:53.712
- [Paige] Yeah.

00:02:53.712 --> 00:02:55.118
Declarative is a statement.

00:02:55.118 --> 00:02:56.734
Interrogative is a question,

00:02:56.734 --> 00:02:58.363
and imperative is a command.

00:02:58.363 --> 00:03:01.900
- [Dave] So, Paige, I think
we can recast our slogan

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.741
in each of these three types of sentence.

00:03:03.741 --> 00:03:04.574
- [Paige] Okay.

00:03:04.574 --> 00:03:06.908
- [Dave] So, okay, so declarative, right?

00:03:06.908 --> 00:03:09.633
That's what it usually
is, declarative form is

00:03:09.633 --> 00:03:11.127
you can learn anything.

00:03:11.127 --> 00:03:12.335
- [Paige] Okay.

00:03:12.335 --> 00:03:14.382
- [Dave] We can make it a
question, so interrogative's

00:03:14.382 --> 00:03:16.290
can you learn anything?

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.123
- [Paige] Right.

00:03:17.123 --> 00:03:18.267
- [Dave] The answer is yes.
- [Paige] Yes.

00:03:18.267 --> 00:03:20.336
- [Dave] And the imperative,
we wanna make it a command,

00:03:20.336 --> 00:03:21.795
would be what, Paige?

00:03:21.795 --> 00:03:22.884
- [Paige] Learn anything!

00:03:22.884 --> 00:03:24.404
- [Dave] Yeah!

00:03:24.404 --> 00:03:26.485
So you can do any of those three.

00:03:26.485 --> 00:03:27.598
- [Paige] Sure.

00:03:27.598 --> 00:03:28.498
- [Dave] David out.

00:03:28.498 --> 00:03:30.165
- [Paige] Paige out.
