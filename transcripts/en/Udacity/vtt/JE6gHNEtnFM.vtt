00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.690
To declare an array of strings with space for ten

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:05.820
values, we would make the variable, and give it a

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:09.390
type of string array, and an initial value of a

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:13.000
new string array with space for ten items. To declare

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.850
an array of strings that contains two values, yes and

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:19.110
no, we'll use the curly brace notation. The type is

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:21.350
the same as before, but now we put the strings,

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:25.700
yes and no, in the curly braces separated by commas.
