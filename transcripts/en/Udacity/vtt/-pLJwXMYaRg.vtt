00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The highest derivative is the first one.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
We have the first derivative, the rate of change,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
but we do not have a second derivative of a rate of change.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Yes, it's the system. We have several equations in parallel. It's explicit.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
The highest derivative appears alone on one side and nowhere else,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and this maybe a surprise, it's not linear.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
The problem is this term and this term as well.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
They are multiplying one component of the solution by another component of the solution.

00:00:32.000 --> 99:59:59.000
This is something like x(t)Â².
