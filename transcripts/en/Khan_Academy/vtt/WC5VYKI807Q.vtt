00:00:00.434 --> 00:00:02.283
- [Voiceover] Let's say that y

00:00:02.283 --> 00:00:04.866
is equal to six over x-squared.

00:00:06.149 --> 00:00:09.171
What I wanna do in this
video is figure out

00:00:09.171 --> 00:00:13.338
what is the second derivative
of y with respect to x.

00:00:16.976 --> 00:00:19.559
And if you're wondering where
this notation comes from

00:00:19.559 --> 00:00:22.587
for a second derivative,
imagine if you started

00:00:22.587 --> 00:00:26.264
with your y, and you
first take a derivative,

00:00:26.264 --> 00:00:28.593
and we've seen this notation before.

00:00:28.593 --> 00:00:30.733
So that would be the first derivative.

00:00:30.733 --> 00:00:33.261
Then we wanna take the derivative of that.

00:00:33.261 --> 00:00:35.883
So we then wanna take
the derivative of that

00:00:35.883 --> 00:00:39.028
to get us our second derivative.

00:00:39.028 --> 00:00:41.695
And so that's where that
notation comes from.

00:00:41.695 --> 00:00:44.879
It likes you have a d-squared, d times d,

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.427
although you're not
really multiplying them.

00:00:46.427 --> 00:00:48.394
You're applying the
derivative operator twice.

00:00:48.394 --> 00:00:50.576
It looks like you have a dx-squared.

00:00:50.576 --> 00:00:51.949
Once again, you're not multiplying 'em,

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:53.859
you're just applying the operator twice.

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:56.562
But that's where that
notation actually comes from.

00:00:56.562 --> 00:00:58.841
Well, let's first take
the first derivative

00:00:58.841 --> 00:01:00.473
of y with respect to x.

00:01:00.473 --> 00:01:02.217
And to do that, let's
just remind ourselves

00:01:02.217 --> 00:01:05.338
that we just have to
apply the power rule here,

00:01:05.338 --> 00:01:07.998
and we can just remind
ourselves, based on the fact

00:01:07.998 --> 00:01:12.081
that y is equal to six
x to the negative two.

00:01:13.027 --> 00:01:15.419
So let's take the derivative
of both sides of this

00:01:15.419 --> 00:01:19.586
with respect to x, so with
respect to x, gonna do that,

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:25.097
and so on the left-hand
side, I'm gonna have

00:01:25.097 --> 00:01:28.930
dy dx is equal to, now
on the right-hand side,

00:01:30.442 --> 00:01:33.670
take our negative two,
multiply it times the six,

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.328
it's gonna get negative 12 x
to the negative two minus one

00:01:37.328 --> 00:01:39.408
is x to the negative three.

00:01:39.408 --> 00:01:41.564
Actually, let me give myself
a little bit more space here.

00:01:41.564 --> 00:01:46.206
So this negative 12 x
to the negative three.

00:01:46.206 --> 00:01:47.938
And now, let's take the derivative of that

00:01:47.938 --> 00:01:49.438
with respect to x.

00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:54.542
So I'm gonna apply the
derivative operator again,

00:01:55.542 --> 00:01:58.715
so the derivative with respect to x.

00:01:58.715 --> 00:02:03.142
Now the left-hand side gets
the second derivative of y

00:02:03.142 --> 00:02:07.402
with respect to to x,
is going to be equal to,

00:02:07.402 --> 00:02:09.447
well, we just use the power rule again,

00:02:09.447 --> 00:02:13.447
negative three times
negative 12 is positive 36,

00:02:14.387 --> 00:02:17.324
times x to the, well,
negative three minus one

00:02:17.324 --> 00:02:19.147
is negative four power,

00:02:19.147 --> 00:02:23.314
which we could also write as
36 over x to the fourth power.

00:02:24.537 --> 00:02:25.787
And we're done.
