00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:03.045
FEMALE SPEAKER:
Hello, everybody.

00:00:03.045 --> 00:00:04.180
Thanks for being here.

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:07.820
Today we are joined by Chef
Magnus Nilsson, head chef--

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:11.680
woo-hoo!-- of Faviken, which
is a hyper-local restaurant

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.150
in the wilds of Sweden.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.200
It is currently ranked number 25
on the world's best restaurant

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.170
list.

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:21.090
He is the author of a cookbook
by the same name, "Faviken,"

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.800
as well as "The Nordic
Cookbook," which

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.500
is for sale today.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.340
And he has appeared
on "Mind of a Chef"

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.147
on PBS and Netflix's
"Chef's Table."

00:00:29.147 --> 00:00:31.480
I'm going to hand it over to
the man you're here to see.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:32.297
Enjoy.

00:00:32.297 --> 00:00:33.380
MAGNUS NILSSON: Thank you.

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:38.940
Thanks for coming, everyone.

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.465
So this is really exciting.

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.090
So I've written this book,
"The Nordic Cookbook,"

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.480
and I'm going to talk a little
bit about the Nordic food

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.290
culture in general
first, and then

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.150
continue by talking a
little bit about how

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:53.233
the book was put together.

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.560
One thing with the Nordic
region is that most people

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.106
don't really know what it is.

00:01:02.106 --> 00:01:03.480
And that's one of
the reasons why

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.692
I wrote this book, actually.

00:01:04.692 --> 00:01:06.400
And I've done-- through
these events I've

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.847
done kind of a little study.

00:01:09.847 --> 00:01:11.680
So there's going to be
a raise of hands now.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.260
How many people in this room
can tell the difference,

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.810
with certainty, between the
Nordic region and Scandinavia?

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:20.310
One down there.

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.840
Two?

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.350
And one that's doing this.

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.490
That's 2 and 1/2.

00:01:26.856 --> 00:01:29.480
It's usually about 10%, so that
was a little bit below average,

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.980
actually.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.890
So Scandinavia is Norway,
Sweden, and Denmark,

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:38.960
and nothing else.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.320
And the Nordics is Scandinavia,
plus Finland in the east,

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.340
and a little island called Aland
in between Finland and Sweden,

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.430
and the Faroe Islands, and
Iceland, and Greenland also.

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.420
It's a huge geographical area.

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.550
You can see it all here.

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.050
And that's one of the defining
factors on Nordic culture,

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:00.860
and definitely also
Nordic food culture,

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.230
is that it's such a big area.

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:03.785
And in a big area,
naturally, you

00:02:03.785 --> 00:02:05.170
have lots of diversity as well.

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.610
One thing with the
Nordic region also, it's

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.450
a geographical construction.

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.500
It's not a homogeneous
cultural region,

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.640
probably because it is so big.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.390
Someone basically
sat down in an office

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.000
sometime and decided that
all of these countries here,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.850
depending on who made war with
who, there is one region now.

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.860
But you can imagine that going
to, for example, the southeast

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.726
of Finland is going to be
quite different to Greenland,

00:02:33.726 --> 00:02:34.225
for example.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.340
I get-- quite often I
get the question, when

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.600
I talk about this book,
about Nordic dishes

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.330
or pan-Nordic dishes,
dishes that would

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.180
exist in the whole region.

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.750
And the thing is that
there aren't any of those.

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.360
There are no dishes
that look the same

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.360
throughout this whole region.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.730
And one of the few things
that actually tie the regions

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.210
together is the seasons,
the fact that we have four

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:05.750
defined seasons.

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.502
And one of them, the
winter, is a season

00:03:07.502 --> 00:03:09.627
where you can't harvest
anything, at least no plant

00:03:09.627 --> 00:03:10.830
foods.

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.630
So all of these regions,
historically, you

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.310
had to produce an excess
of food in summer,

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.120
store it, prepare it some way,
and then consume it in winter.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.850
And obviously, these days, no
one has to do that anymore.

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:24.722
We can import food.

00:03:24.722 --> 00:03:25.680
And we can refrigerate.

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:26.310
And we can freeze.

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:27.726
And we can do all
kinds of things.

00:03:27.726 --> 00:03:30.937
But it's still something that's
a defining factor in the way we

00:03:30.937 --> 00:03:32.890
eat, and the
preferences that we have

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:34.230
for food in the Nordic region.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:42.940
And one example of a dish that's
as close to a pan-Nordic dish

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.250
as you get, and also a
great example of a dish that

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.160
uses these things, the
defining factor that you

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.610
have to store food for
winter, is the open sandwich--

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.950
you know, a piece of
bread with toppings.

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.640
And then we don't put the
second, unnecessary slice

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.760
of bread, like you guys
do, on top, but, you know,

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.170
the open sandwich.

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.120
And the interesting
thing with that,

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.830
if you start looking
at the bread,

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.720
is that, obviously,
it's made from grains.

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.630
Grains is one of the
most convenient ways

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:19.680
of storing solar energy from
summer into the dark months

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:20.980
of the year.

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:22.830
It doesn't go bad.

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:23.970
It's very, very stable.

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:25.030
It has good shelf life.

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.530
And it's easy to process
into many, many things.

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.880
The bread also says quite a
lot about the circumstances

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:31.930
of where it's produced.

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.140
And we can start by looking
at the loaf, for example.

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:37.840
A loaf of bread, which
is an everyday staple

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.470
in large parts of
the world today,

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:43.405
is actually kind
of a luxury item.

00:04:43.405 --> 00:04:46.730
It needs very special
circumstances to be produced

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:49.160
and to become an
everyday staple.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.770
And in the Nordic
region, you'll have

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.560
loaves of bread, historically,
as the base of sandwiches

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.250
basically from a
line around Stockholm

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.190
somewhere and then
through South Sweden,

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:03.550
a little bit in South Norway,
and then through Denmark.

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.030
And why is this, then?

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:07.010
Two reasons.

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:10.830
One is that it's the only
parts of the Nordic region who

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:14.020
are truly urban, meaning that
you have enough population

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.190
density so you can
actually have bakeries.

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:18.920
Because if you're
going to eat slices

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:21.530
cut from a loaf of bread, you
want to have it pretty fresh

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:24.050
at least-- if not daily
fresh, at least not more

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:25.615
than a couple days old.

00:05:25.615 --> 00:05:27.990
And if you think that modern
transportation hasn't really

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:32.760
been efficient enough to move
around foods for more than 60

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.980
or 70 or perhaps
100 years, which

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:38.020
is a very, very
small perspective

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.574
in historical terms.

00:05:40.574 --> 00:05:42.490
Another thing with the
loaf is that, if you're

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:44.750
going to bake a loaf,
at least if you're not

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:47.020
using a tin for a
rye loaf, you have

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:51.290
to have wheat flour, high-gluten
wheat flour preferably,

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:53.259
because otherwise
it doesn't rise.

00:05:53.259 --> 00:05:55.800
And wheat doesn't really grow
that much in the Nordic region.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.080
It pretty much grows in
that same area that I just

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.331
described, the south parts
of Sweden and Denmark,

00:06:00.331 --> 00:06:01.830
and a little bit
in southern Norway.

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:07.620
If you look at other parts,
like where I grew up,

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:09.760
there is no wheat.

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:11.920
So it's very difficult
to make loaves.

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:14.790
There is also much less people.

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:17.790
Today, where I
live, the population

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:21.680
is one person per
square kilometer,

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:25.471
meaning that bakeries
aren't very, very common.

00:06:25.471 --> 00:06:26.970
There is one city
in my region, it's

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:29.080
the size of Denmark,
the whole region,

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.420
a sixth of the surface of
Sweden, one bakery, one city.

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:37.370
Because of this, people have
a completely different bread

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:38.910
baking tradition.

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:43.340
Instead of having bakeries and
bread becoming a staple, people

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:46.330
going out to buy their
bread on a daily basis,

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:49.940
everyone had their own
baking ovens instead.

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:53.690
And to heat the baking
oven with firewood,

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:56.600
it's pretty expensive because
you use a lot of firewood,

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.270
and there's also a
lot of work involved.

00:06:58.270 --> 00:06:59.770
It takes several
days to heat it up

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:02.290
to a proper baking temperature.

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:04.420
And because of this, people
didn't bake very often.

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:07.640
So baking up north
was considered

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:09.940
more of a kind of
activity you did, maybe,

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:12.330
twice a year, maybe
even once a year.

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:16.100
And it was really only a way
of processing those grains

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:19.110
so that they became
more easy to eat.

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:22.850
So what people used to do was
to fire up the big baking oven,

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:29.400
like, mid-November, turn their
dried grains into flour--

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:31.560
predominantly barley
is what we use--

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:34.210
and then start by
making thin flat breads,

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:37.650
like two millimeters thin,
about this size, 80 centimeters

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:40.190
in diameter, and cook
them at really high heat,

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:43.679
like 800 degrees Celsius,
for half a minute.

00:07:43.679 --> 00:07:45.970
And then you take them out
and they dry really quickly.

00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:48.090
And when they're dry,
you can just stack them.

00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:50.590
And you can keep them for
a very, very long time.

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:53.720
And they're consumed, basically,
by you break off a piece

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:56.069
and you put some butter
on, a slice of cheese,

00:07:56.069 --> 00:07:57.360
and you eat it like a sandwich.

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:00.600
Or you can just crumble it
into cultured milk, or a broth,

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:02.230
or something like that.

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:04.169
And after they made
these dried flat breads,

00:08:04.169 --> 00:08:06.210
they would continue doing
soft flat breads, which

00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:08.556
is pretty much the same thing
just a little bit thicker,

00:08:08.556 --> 00:08:11.056
and cooked at a slightly lower
temperature, because the oven

00:08:11.056 --> 00:08:12.910
has cooled a little bit.

00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:15.840
And that was
considered something

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:18.770
like a seasonal thing,
something you ate only

00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:21.172
when you were baking, because
they don't keep very well.

00:08:21.172 --> 00:08:22.880
These days you can
buy them all the time,

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:26.310
because we freeze them,
so it's kind of different.

00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:31.010
Going on, after this, people
would continue by doing loaves.

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:34.503
And because the loaf--
because of the fact

00:08:34.503 --> 00:08:36.169
that you have to eat
it fresh and people

00:08:36.169 --> 00:08:37.940
didn't bake on a
very regular basis,

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:41.690
it was considered a luxury item,
instead of, like in the south,

00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:43.350
an everyday commodity.

00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:46.680
And because of this, like
as with many of the things

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:49.585
that we really find
special, we try

00:08:49.585 --> 00:08:52.210
to make them even more special,
so people added everything that

00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:53.880
was expensive to their loaves.

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:57.275
And, in this case, quite
often lots of sugar and lots

00:08:57.275 --> 00:08:58.690
of spices.

00:08:58.690 --> 00:09:02.110
So the further north you
go, in Scandinavia at least,

00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:05.710
the sweeter the loaves
and the more seasoned.

00:09:05.710 --> 00:09:08.080
You would have a hard time
finding a traditional recipe

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:12.060
from Denmark or South Sweden
that has any sugar or spices

00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:13.500
at all in it, actually.

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:17.506
It's even-- I remember
my grandma's rye loaves

00:09:17.506 --> 00:09:18.130
when I grew up.

00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:21.276
They were almost, basically,
like an eggless sponge cake

00:09:21.276 --> 00:09:22.400
with gingerbread seasoning.

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:23.460
It was very, very sweet.

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:32.220
To continue looking at
other parts of the Nordics

00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:36.940
as well, like Norway, they have
pretty much the same flat bread

00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:40.300
tradition as Sweden does, but
they don't have as many trees

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:43.830
because they have a pretty harsh
coastal climate in the north.

00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:46.120
So they figured out more
energy efficient ways

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:50.290
to cook their flat breads than
firing up that big baking oven.

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:51.780
And quite often
in Norway we find

00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:55.689
that the bread is cooked on a
heated flat stone or a piece

00:09:55.689 --> 00:09:57.230
of sheet iron or
something like that,

00:09:57.230 --> 00:09:59.060
with a fire underneath instead.

00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:01.180
And you can continue
going on to Iceland, which

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:03.010
is where this is photographed.

00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:08.180
On Iceland they don't have
any trees at all almost.

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:10.430
And because of this, they
don't have a tradition

00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:12.300
of baking ovens either.

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:14.270
But what they do have is
thermally active areas

00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:15.550
and volcanic areas.

00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:18.790
And quite often you'll find,
just outside of the village

00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:21.700
centers, if you have
a hot springs area

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:24.920
or something like that,
people have a little spot

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:27.220
where every house in the
village have their own hole

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:30.400
in the ground with a lid.

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:32.950
And you go there in the evening
with your rye bread dough

00:10:32.950 --> 00:10:35.440
in a bucket, you put it down
in the hole, put the lid on,

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:39.350
and you come back in the morning
to pick your steamed loaf out.

00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:41.600
And this is something that's
been going since forever.

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:43.558
And it's pretty cool that
it's still happening.

00:10:43.558 --> 00:10:47.440
And, as far as I know, it's the
only example of steamed bread

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:48.690
historically found in Europe.

00:10:51.729 --> 00:10:54.270
So this is-- that was a little
bit about the base, the bread,

00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:55.530
the base of the sandwich.

00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:57.450
And we can continue
looking at the toppings

00:10:57.450 --> 00:10:59.880
as well, which is something
that perhaps is even more

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:03.620
about the culture and the
circumstances in the areas

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:05.910
where the sandwiches
are produced.

00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:09.290
This photo here, it's taken in a
restaurant in Copenhagen called

00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:12.940
Schonnemann, which is one of the
most traditional, Danish-style

00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:15.055
open face sandwich restaurants.

00:11:15.055 --> 00:11:16.870
And you can see the
sandwiches here.

00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:18.130
They're super rich.

00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:19.310
There are so much toppings.

00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:21.850
You can't even pick that
sandwich up and eat it.

00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:24.070
You have to eat it from
a plate with cutlery.

00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:27.190
And it says quite a lot
about Denmark as a country,

00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:29.090
historically,
being the only land

00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:31.240
connection between the
Nordics and central Europe.

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:33.430
Loads of trade went
through Denmark.

00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:37.170
And it's also a very rich
agricultural country,

00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:39.920
lots of farming, which
really shows, I think,

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:42.870
in the way the
sandwiches are eaten.

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:46.800
Going up to where I live,
much poorer, less population

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:49.130
density, harsher climate.

00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:50.620
As I said before,
the sandwich is

00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:53.221
more likely to be a piece
of thin, crisp bread

00:11:53.221 --> 00:11:54.970
with some butter and
cheese, and something

00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:56.780
you probably eat
standing up, rather than

00:11:56.780 --> 00:12:02.020
sitting down like this, with
beer and aquavit and stuff.

00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:05.510
Same goes, for example,
with a Sami family

00:12:05.510 --> 00:12:07.800
because they also have
a type of flat bread.

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:12.840
Being semi-nomadic, they don't
have access to baking ovens

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:15.140
but they also cooked
on flat stones

00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:17.316
that they carried with them
when they moved around.

00:12:17.316 --> 00:12:19.940
And they probably wouldn't even
put the topping on the sandwich

00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:22.819
but rather have it on the side,
like eating bread and toppings

00:12:22.819 --> 00:12:23.610
next to each other.

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:29.720
So this photo here is
from the Faroe Islands.

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:33.860
And here you can see
a very clear influence

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:36.300
on the bread side of
things from Denmark,

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:39.740
because Faroe Islands is a
self-governed part of Denmark.

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:44.930
They have a completely
different topping culture.

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:47.750
This here is called
raest and it's

00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:53.480
quite unique to the North
Atlantic island communities,

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:56.620
this way of preparing meat.

00:12:56.620 --> 00:13:00.370
Because the thing is there that,
since before modern shipping,

00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:03.690
they didn't have access to
salt in big cheap quantities

00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:08.260
like we've had in Europe
for a long, long time,

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:11.460
simply because it was
too cold to evaporate it

00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:14.150
in salterns like you would in
Spain or Italy or something

00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:18.860
like that, and not enough fuel
to fuel salt pans like they

00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:21.149
did, for example, in
the British Islands.

00:13:21.149 --> 00:13:23.440
So all the salt was imported,
which was very expensive,

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:26.300
and it was pretty much
only used for seasoning.

00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:30.480
So you find that almost all of
the preservation methods that

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:32.700
are used are saltless.

00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:36.780
And in almost all the
other Western cultures,

00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:40.660
we rely heavily
on salt to induce

00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:42.940
lactobacillus fermentation,
produce lactic acid,

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:46.604
and thereby
producing safe foods.

00:13:46.604 --> 00:13:48.520
And this is something
that we see still today.

00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:51.620
People don't think about it,
but all kinds of cheese, olives,

00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:53.650
charcuterie pretty
much everything

00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:58.690
that's umami, rich, and
savory relies on that salt

00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:01.680
to actually become what it is.

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:06.960
And not having enough salt to
do that on the Faroe Islands,

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:09.820
people instead
figured out other ways

00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:13.270
to control the microbiological
flora in their meats.

00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:15.990
And one way is just take your
mutton when it's slaughtered,

00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:18.450
hang it in these houses that
are called hjallur, which

00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:21.421
are latticed, and letting
the very special climate

00:14:21.421 --> 00:14:23.420
that you have on the Faroe
Islands work on them.

00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:26.320
Because this is located in
the middle of the Gulf Stream,

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:28.502
so the climate is very
stable all around the year,

00:14:28.502 --> 00:14:30.460
pretty much the same
temperature, same humidity

00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:32.690
all the time.

00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:36.170
And this, together with
other local circumstances,

00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:38.340
produces really good
growing conditions

00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:40.555
for certain types of
mold, for example.

00:14:40.555 --> 00:14:42.560
And instead of just
rotting and decaying,

00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:44.660
it actually preserves the meat.

00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:48.680
But you have to be tuned into
those flavors, because for us,

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:52.810
most Westerners, the reason
we like, for example,

00:14:52.810 --> 00:14:55.469
mature cheese or ham
or something like that,

00:14:55.469 --> 00:14:57.760
is simply because we've been
taught through generations

00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:00.860
that that's the
flavor of safe foods.

00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:03.670
It's a preservation technique
that's going to not kill you,

00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:05.620
basically.

00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:07.970
Eating raest is like
the other way around.

00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:11.450
Your body actually tells you
that this is going to kill you.

00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:15.510
It smells like rotting
meat, death basically.

00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:18.460
And even if you look at 10
other people, 10 Faroese people

00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:21.850
standing around you, obviously
still being alive, eating

00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:25.310
the meat, it's kind of
a conscious struggle

00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:26.740
to put in your mouth.

00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:29.390
It's very interesting
actually, because most often,

00:15:29.390 --> 00:15:31.214
at least not to me,
there's no struggle

00:15:31.214 --> 00:15:32.380
to put things in your mouth.

00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:38.124
And if they don't top their
sandwiches with raest,

00:15:38.124 --> 00:15:39.540
there's a good
chance that they'll

00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:43.290
do it with pretty much the only
thing that grows on the Faroe

00:15:43.290 --> 00:15:46.360
Islands that you can turn into
marmalade, which is rhubarb,

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:48.650
which is also true for Iceland.

00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:51.290
There are no berries growing
on either Iceland or the Faroe

00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:53.081
Islands, pretty much.

00:15:53.081 --> 00:15:54.330
And rhubarb is really popular.

00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:57.870
It contains a lot of vitamin
C, which traditionally was very

00:15:57.870 --> 00:16:01.060
difficult to come by up there.

00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:04.800
On Iceland, also being a North
Atlantic island community,

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:08.130
they do a lot of the same
saltless preservation

00:16:08.130 --> 00:16:11.260
techniques that you'll find
on the Faroe Islands as well.

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:13.280
But they also smoke
quite a lot of meat.

00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:16.750
And they do it in
smoke houses like this.

00:16:16.750 --> 00:16:19.490
Iceland, as the Faroe Islands,
have very, very few trees.

00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:21.680
And there's several
reasons for this.

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:24.241
One is that, obviously,
it's very remote

00:16:24.241 --> 00:16:26.740
so there are not that many seeds
blowing around in the wind.

00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:29.767
Another is that the
climate is harsh.

00:16:29.767 --> 00:16:31.350
And the third, and
most important one,

00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:33.215
is that they have
sheep everywhere that

00:16:33.215 --> 00:16:34.090
eat all the saplings.

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:39.460
And sheep, they
also produce shit,

00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:41.760
which is collected to fuel
the smoke houses, which

00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:43.740
is pretty special.

00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:50.074
So enough talking
about sandwiches

00:16:50.074 --> 00:16:51.990
as a cultural marker,
even though I think it's

00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:53.120
very, very interesting.

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:55.112
It says so much about
where it's eaten.

00:16:55.112 --> 00:16:56.570
I'm also going to
talk a little bit

00:16:56.570 --> 00:16:59.990
about how the book was
put together and why.

00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:03.950
Initially, I wasn't very
keen on doing this book

00:17:03.950 --> 00:17:06.490
and I was quite offended
when I was asked, actually.

00:17:06.490 --> 00:17:10.609
Because I'm Swedish and,
as most people living

00:17:10.609 --> 00:17:14.640
in the Nordic region, I identify
myself with the place I live,

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:17.440
rather than the
region as a whole.

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:19.270
So I'm Swedish, not Nordic.

00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:20.780
And I thought it
was a bit strange

00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:23.180
to take all of these
different cultures

00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:25.880
and put them in one book, and
labeling that with something.

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:28.940
It was a bit like taking some
German, some Portuguese food

00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:30.770
cultures, some Italian,
and some French

00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:32.145
and just putting
that in one book

00:17:32.145 --> 00:17:37.350
and calling it "The
European Cookbook."

00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:40.160
And after awhile,
after maybe a couple

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:42.440
of weeks of discussions
with the publisher--

00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:44.564
because I wanted to do a
completely different book.

00:17:44.564 --> 00:17:46.490
I wanted to do a Swedish book.

00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:50.520
But after a couple of weeks of
discussions with the publisher,

00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:52.040
I realized two things.

00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:55.410
One was that the very reason
I didn't want to do it

00:17:55.410 --> 00:17:58.150
was why it should be done,
because most people don't know

00:17:58.150 --> 00:18:00.840
what the region is, let alone
what the food culture looks

00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:01.570
like.

00:18:01.570 --> 00:18:03.820
And this is also something
that applies for people

00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:05.090
living in the region.

00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:07.870
So it's not just people
here in the US, for example.

00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:09.320
Very few people
in the world know

00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:13.150
what Nordic cooking looks like,
except for those very obvious

00:18:13.150 --> 00:18:15.980
dishes like the herrings, and
the meatballs, and gravlax,

00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:17.750
and stuff like that.

00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:21.474
And the other reason was simply
that the publisher had clearly

00:18:21.474 --> 00:18:23.640
decided that there was going
to be a Nordic cookbook

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:25.931
and if I didn't do it, someone
else was going to do it.

00:18:25.931 --> 00:18:26.812
I didn't want that.

00:18:29.410 --> 00:18:31.340
So the purpose of
this book was really

00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:35.980
to explain what Nordic
food culture looks like.

00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:38.010
How all of these
different food cultures

00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:41.220
come together, but
also how they differ.

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:46.580
And that was kind of the whole
idea from the very beginning.

00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:49.050
And I also wanted the book
to be a documentation of what

00:18:49.050 --> 00:18:50.680
the food culture
looks like today.

00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:52.471
Because it's very easy,
when writing a book

00:18:52.471 --> 00:18:58.270
like this, that it turns
into some idealized fairytale

00:18:58.270 --> 00:19:03.910
version of food culture, and
that's not very interesting.

00:19:03.910 --> 00:19:06.190
And it's not very
accurate, either.

00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:09.330
So the book contains a little
bit of historical dishes

00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:12.210
that no one is going
to cook, I think,

00:19:12.210 --> 00:19:15.190
perhaps 50, something like that.

00:19:15.190 --> 00:19:17.470
But they're still important,
because they explain

00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:18.694
something about food culture.

00:19:18.694 --> 00:19:20.610
And they're important
for at least some people

00:19:20.610 --> 00:19:21.632
within the region.

00:19:21.632 --> 00:19:23.715
But the vast majority of
recipes in the book, they

00:19:23.715 --> 00:19:27.140
are really the recipes that
are used on an everyday basis

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:29.740
in most Nordic homes.

00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:32.840
And that has also
meant that there's

00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:35.150
been quite a lot of
dishes that there

00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:37.710
was debate around whether they
were actually Nordic or not.

00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:40.570
And this is one of them,
which is, I just heard,

00:19:40.570 --> 00:19:42.270
they also served in
the cafe today here.

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:47.760
What defines a
regional specialty

00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:50.920
is really difficult
to decide actually.

00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:52.160
And who is to decide that?

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:54.190
Who is the decider
of those things?

00:19:56.950 --> 00:20:00.980
I think that one of the
most interesting things we

00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:02.910
do in the research
for the book, for me,

00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:05.680
was to figure out how all of
these dishes that have been

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:10.000
created over the last 20 or 30
years actually was invented,

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.580
and why they made sense
then, and why some of them

00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:13.880
still make sense.

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:17.570
And the taco quiche is
an interesting example,

00:20:17.570 --> 00:20:20.700
because it's the definition,
to me, of a regional specialty.

00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:23.350
I'm going to try to explain why.

00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:26.330
So the idea, the taco,
the concept of the taco,

00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:30.080
it came to Sweden in the
late '80s, early '90s.

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:32.420
And it was brought by
spice companies who wanted

00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:34.930
to sell spice mix, taco kits.

00:20:34.930 --> 00:20:38.030
And it wasn't very--
it's not authentic.

00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:42.550
It's like bastardized
Tex-Mex tacos,

00:20:42.550 --> 00:20:44.220
but they became really popular.

00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:46.510
I remember growing
up having tacos

00:20:46.510 --> 00:20:50.470
at my house made from moose,
mints, and stuff like that.

00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:52.380
And the interesting
thing with something

00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:54.320
that becomes really
popular, and something

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:57.210
that people start
doing on a bigger scale

00:20:57.210 --> 00:21:00.220
is that, after a while,
it becomes boring.

00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:01.950
And when it becomes
boring is actually

00:21:01.950 --> 00:21:04.520
when the really interesting
stuff starts to happen,

00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:07.620
because that's when people,
they are changing things.

00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:12.200
And that's when people start
to adapt their own preferences

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:15.510
into the local circumstances,
ending up with dishes like,

00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:17.810
for example, the
taco quiche emerge

00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:20.770
between the bastardized
Tex-Mex taco

00:21:20.770 --> 00:21:24.580
kit and a traditional
Swedish meat pie, basically.

00:21:29.410 --> 00:21:33.949
So what defines the
regional specialty?

00:21:33.949 --> 00:21:36.490
We can look at different, sort
of-- we can compare two dishes

00:21:36.490 --> 00:21:41.510
and we can look at different
critical points to them.

00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:44.230
There is one dish called
surstromming in Sweden,

00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:45.170
sour herring.

00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:47.365
Has anyone heard about that?

00:21:47.365 --> 00:21:49.980
A few people.

00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:54.420
So the sour herring-- if
you ask a bunch of Swedes

00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:57.340
to name one Swedish
dish, quite a few of them

00:21:57.340 --> 00:22:02.840
are going to say sour herring,
which is kind of interesting.

00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:08.250
The sour herring is the
world's stinkiest food.

00:22:08.250 --> 00:22:10.370
It's not immediately
pleasurable.

00:22:10.370 --> 00:22:11.570
Keep that in mind now.

00:22:11.570 --> 00:22:12.290
OK.

00:22:12.290 --> 00:22:14.350
So, if we look at
the two dishes,

00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:16.959
produced in the region
could be a factor defining

00:22:16.959 --> 00:22:19.000
whether something is a
regional specialty or not.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.360
Like all of these foods
here, the store-bought salsa,

00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:25.167
medium hot, that's definitely
produced in Sweden.

00:22:25.167 --> 00:22:26.250
That's produced in Sweden.

00:22:26.250 --> 00:22:28.750
And those nachos are
also produced in Sweden.

00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:31.431
The sour herring is fished
in the Baltics, fermented

00:22:31.431 --> 00:22:31.930
in Sweden.

00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:33.890
So there are no
differences there.

00:22:33.890 --> 00:22:36.850
So that's not a
defining factor anymore.

00:22:36.850 --> 00:22:40.670
The history-- so
the taco quiche,

00:22:40.670 --> 00:22:43.440
we know that it's been around
for 25 years or something

00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:45.670
like that, maybe a
little bit longer.

00:22:45.670 --> 00:22:48.750
So that's a very short time
in a historical perspective.

00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:51.250
And most people think, maybe,
that the sour herring has been

00:22:51.250 --> 00:22:52.550
around for a really long time.

00:22:52.550 --> 00:22:55.190
But if we look at
what it is-- so it's

00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:59.340
a fish fermented with salt.
And that's not very Swedish.

00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:00.770
That's something
that's been done

00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:02.105
all across the whole world.

00:23:02.105 --> 00:23:05.880
It exists in almost every
food culture in some way.

00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:08.430
What makes it unique,
though, is that it's first

00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:13.620
fermented in a barrel, and then
it's transferred to a tin can

00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:16.460
and left to do a second
fermentation in the tin can.

00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:21.020
The tin can, it was invented
in the late 19th century

00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:23.140
and popularized in the
early 20th century.

00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:29.790
Or, sorry, it was invented in
the-- or it was popularized

00:23:29.790 --> 00:23:32.330
in the early 20th
century, right,

00:23:32.330 --> 00:23:35.340
meaning that the dish,
as such, it can't really

00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:36.390
be much older than that.

00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:39.090
So it's like 100 years, which is
also a really short perspective

00:23:39.090 --> 00:23:40.880
in historical terms.

00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:43.180
So that's not a
defining factor either.

00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:46.390
And then we have
cultural importance.

00:23:46.390 --> 00:23:48.300
With food, cultural
importance is quite easy

00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:50.510
to measure because it's
just about how often

00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:52.700
and how much it is consumed.

00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:55.160
And if you take 100 Swedes and
you put them in one big row

00:23:55.160 --> 00:24:00.140
and you ask, how many of
you guys eat sour herring,

00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:03.280
maybe 20 are going to say yes.

00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:06.080
And if you then
ask those 20, how

00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:08.575
often do you eat
sour herring, I don't

00:24:08.575 --> 00:24:10.950
think you're going to find
many that do it more than once

00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:12.750
a year.

00:24:12.750 --> 00:24:14.920
If you ask the same 100
Swedes, how many of you

00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:19.940
guys eat taco quiche, it's
going to be way more than 20.

00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:23.630
And it's quite likely they're
going to eat it way more

00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:25.410
often than once a year.

00:24:25.410 --> 00:24:27.130
So which is the
most Swedish dish?

00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:35.260
And it's quite interesting,
if you go onto the internet

00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:38.000
and start looking at how
much information there

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.860
is about certain things, because
one thing with these more

00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:44.770
recent recipes is that all
that information on when

00:24:44.770 --> 00:24:48.200
they were created and how they
have developed, it's there.

00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:54.390
It's very accessible, as opposed
to the more historical recipes,

00:24:54.390 --> 00:24:59.180
let's say those that were
invented before 1920,

00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:01.390
because they are already
defined by someone else.

00:25:01.390 --> 00:25:03.460
Someone has said what
they are because they've

00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:07.870
been defined in
literature, basically,

00:25:07.870 --> 00:25:10.640
when someone recorded
traditional recipes.

00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:12.469
And then they
haven't changed much.

00:25:12.469 --> 00:25:14.760
But with these more recent
dishes, you can really look.

00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:16.551
You can see-- there's
another recipe, which

00:25:16.551 --> 00:25:19.600
is called kladdkaka, which is
also really popular in Sweden.

00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:22.684
It's another unique
regional specialty.

00:25:22.684 --> 00:25:24.100
And you can follow
its development

00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:26.650
from when it was first
published in 1970-something

00:25:26.650 --> 00:25:27.330
up until today.

00:25:27.330 --> 00:25:29.340
And you can see how it
changed a little bit

00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:32.960
with the passing of time
to enhance the things we

00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:34.580
did that we liked the most.

00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:40.790
And you can also use that to
see how much people actually

00:25:40.790 --> 00:25:43.780
consume and how important it
is with a popular culture.

00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:50.170
And the three most-- or the
two most common recipe searches

00:25:50.170 --> 00:25:54.710
on the internet from Sweden
on different Swedish dishes

00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:59.650
is, actually, kladdkaka is the
most common one, 750,000 hits.

00:25:59.650 --> 00:26:01.700
A population with
9.6 million people

00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:05.690
is a lot of kladdkaka recipes.

00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:08.800
And the second most popular one
is, actually, the taco quiche

00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:11.070
with 175,000 hits.

00:26:11.070 --> 00:26:15.672
That's way more than meat balls
and cabbage rolls and stuff

00:26:15.672 --> 00:26:17.130
like that that's
perhaps considered

00:26:17.130 --> 00:26:20.670
more Swedish in a
traditional perspective.

00:26:20.670 --> 00:26:25.170
I started traveling
around all the Nordics

00:26:25.170 --> 00:26:28.842
and collecting recipes,
basically interviewing people,

00:26:28.842 --> 00:26:30.550
looking at what was
previously published,

00:26:30.550 --> 00:26:32.570
and basically trying to
accumulate as much information

00:26:32.570 --> 00:26:33.240
as possible.

00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:35.197
And at the same time
that this was happening,

00:26:35.197 --> 00:26:36.780
we also had a web-based
poll out where

00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:39.690
people could report and then
submit recipes, and also

00:26:39.690 --> 00:26:42.640
answer to different questions
about how they looked

00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:44.596
on their own food
culture, which was very

00:26:44.596 --> 00:26:46.970
interesting, because it turns
out that the way people see

00:26:46.970 --> 00:26:50.080
their own food culture is very
different from how it actually

00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:52.250
is.

00:26:52.250 --> 00:26:54.870
Very few people said
that taco quiche was

00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:57.880
a common Swedish everyday dish.

00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:01.490
Most people come up with things
like pan-fried salted herring

00:27:01.490 --> 00:27:04.350
and things like that, that
are definitely Swedish,

00:27:04.350 --> 00:27:08.320
but that are eaten
very, very rarely.

00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:12.664
The next step was
to compile an index

00:27:12.664 --> 00:27:14.580
to start sifting through
all of these recipes,

00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:17.580
and to create something that was
as representative as possible

00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:20.320
for as big a part of
the region as possible.

00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:22.140
And then they had
this index sent out

00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:24.170
that had, like, 750
recipes in it, had it

00:27:24.170 --> 00:27:29.190
sent out to one expert
in each region or country

00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:32.670
to be reviewed, and
take away everything

00:27:32.670 --> 00:27:35.190
that was superfluous, and
add things that were missing,

00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:39.120
and correct all the spelling
errors, all those things.

00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:42.170
When the index came back, I
started writing the material

00:27:42.170 --> 00:27:44.010
and formatting the
recipes into something

00:27:44.010 --> 00:27:48.210
that was relatively consistent.

00:27:48.210 --> 00:27:51.170
And after that,
the whole material

00:27:51.170 --> 00:27:53.550
went back out again
to those same experts.

00:27:53.550 --> 00:27:56.560
And all of them
are ordinary people

00:27:56.560 --> 00:27:59.690
with a very big knowledge
on their own food cultures.

00:27:59.690 --> 00:28:02.102
There are no chefs
involved or anything.

00:28:02.102 --> 00:28:04.560
They could review the whole
material again and send it back

00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:09.170
with more feedback, collecting
more spelling errors,

00:28:09.170 --> 00:28:10.110
especially in Finnish.

00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:15.530
When that was
done, the last step

00:28:15.530 --> 00:28:18.880
to put together the content
was to send the whole book

00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:21.810
to a guy named
Richard Tellstrom.

00:28:21.810 --> 00:28:25.660
And he's an associate professor
in ethnology specializing

00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:28.200
in the meal as a
cultural marker.

00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:31.610
And he made sure all the
things were actually correct,

00:28:31.610 --> 00:28:35.270
all of the dates
and stuff like that.

00:28:35.270 --> 00:28:38.220
When the content was done,
I started testing recipes.

00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:42.390
And I tested about 400 of
the 730-something recipes

00:28:42.390 --> 00:28:46.730
in my house, in
my normal kitchen.

00:28:46.730 --> 00:28:49.320
And this, for
example, it's lutefisk

00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:52.207
and all the different
condiments to lutefisk all

00:28:52.207 --> 00:28:53.290
through the Nordic region.

00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:57.910
Here you have some
split pea soup.

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:03.590
A bit of a spinach--
a few spinach dishes.

00:29:03.590 --> 00:29:07.500
And one thing that's
really important in writing

00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:12.300
a book like this that's aimed
to explain, not just to give

00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:14.750
recipes, but also to
explain a cultural context,

00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:16.960
and to explain why
things make sense,

00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:19.440
and how they came up to
be and stuff like that,

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:24.725
is to try to avoid
all assumed knowledge.

00:29:24.725 --> 00:29:26.350
And that's really
difficult, especially

00:29:26.350 --> 00:29:28.475
when you think that you
know a lot about something.

00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:32.870
And we had to work very,
very hard with this.

00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:36.660
And one of the steps to try
to avoid assumed knowledge

00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:39.460
was to send different
dishes of different recipes

00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:41.000
out to testers.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.770
So we had about 100 recipes
in the book that was sent out

00:29:43.770 --> 00:29:47.040
to testers all over the world.

00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:49.600
And it was quite fascinating
to see how much came back.

00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:53.010
I have one example here.

00:29:53.010 --> 00:29:58.320
So this was supposed to
be a Swedish layer cake.

00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:01.310
And they shouldn't
look like that.

00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:04.610
And the thing is that
this is actually--

00:30:04.610 --> 00:30:06.780
everything that I
wrote in this recipe,

00:30:06.780 --> 00:30:11.909
it's been perfectly executed,
exactly the way I wrote it.

00:30:11.909 --> 00:30:13.450
The cake has been
baked the same way.

00:30:13.450 --> 00:30:14.890
All the fillings were
made the same way.

00:30:14.890 --> 00:30:17.015
The berries were handled
the same way and all that.

00:30:17.015 --> 00:30:20.940
And I just forgot to
include one thing and that

00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:24.080
made this whole recipe
kind of just not function.

00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:27.730
I forgot to say how to assemble
it because, to me, it's

00:30:27.730 --> 00:30:28.350
so obvious.

00:30:28.350 --> 00:30:30.117
There's only one
way of doing it.

00:30:30.117 --> 00:30:31.700
There's one way of
doing a layer cake.

00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:36.280
This is another example.

00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:38.940
This looks pretty
good, actually.

00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:40.920
But it's wrong.

00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:43.740
And the thing here-- this
is from an American recipe

00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:47.020
tester-- and thing here
is that it turns out

00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:50.660
that the round cake
tins in the US,

00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:53.100
they are 25 millimeters
smaller in diameter

00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:55.820
than the standard round
cake tins in Sweden.

00:30:55.820 --> 00:31:00.730
So this cake is,
like, 50% too high.

00:31:00.730 --> 00:31:02.740
And it's still a good
cake and all that,

00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:05.790
but it looks nothing like
it should, basically.

00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:11.880
And here, this is
actually a recipe

00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:13.910
where I don't know
what happened there.

00:31:13.910 --> 00:31:16.304
This is totally wrong.

00:31:16.304 --> 00:31:17.970
Because I still haven't
figured out what

00:31:17.970 --> 00:31:20.095
I did wrong when I wrote
the instructions for this.

00:31:20.095 --> 00:31:23.500
But this was supposed
to be pickled Herring.

00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:26.380
Anyhow, so that's
"The Nordic Cookbook,"

00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:28.690
and thank you so
much for listening.

00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:38.535
Are there any questions?

00:31:38.535 --> 00:31:40.400
AUDIENCE: How do you
become a recipe tester?

00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:42.525
MAGNUS NILSSON: You want
to become a recipe tester?

00:31:42.525 --> 00:31:43.470
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:43.470 --> 00:31:45.950
MAGNUS NILSSON: Well, I don't
know if Peter at Phaidon

00:31:45.950 --> 00:31:46.635
can answer that.

00:31:46.635 --> 00:31:49.660
AUDIENCE: I also don't
know the answer to that.

00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:53.020
MAGNUS NILSSON: I guess
that you just, maybe,

00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:55.080
email a publishing
company and say that you

00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:57.967
want to start testing recipes.

00:31:57.967 --> 00:32:00.300
The thing is that there are
professional recipe testers.

00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:03.560
And some of the recipes, because
they know exactly what to look

00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:07.850
for, what to try to find
what's wrong, and about half

00:32:07.850 --> 00:32:09.421
of the recipes
that we tried out,

00:32:09.421 --> 00:32:11.420
they were tested by
professional recipe testers,

00:32:11.420 --> 00:32:15.690
and the other half were tested
by just ordinary people who

00:32:15.690 --> 00:32:17.775
someone found somewhere.

00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:22.050
Any more questions?

00:32:22.050 --> 00:32:22.788
There?

00:32:22.788 --> 00:32:25.350
AUDIENCE: How much traveling
did you do for the book?

00:32:25.350 --> 00:32:27.391
MALE SPEAKER: Just repeat
the question since they

00:32:27.391 --> 00:32:28.770
don't have a mic on them.

00:32:28.770 --> 00:32:29.990
MAGNUS NILSSON: Yeah.

00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:32.700
So, how much traveling
did I do for the book?

00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:35.332
The whole process of producing
the book was about three years,

00:32:35.332 --> 00:32:37.290
and the first two years
I travelled pretty much

00:32:37.290 --> 00:32:39.390
everywhere I could
in the Nordic region.

00:32:39.390 --> 00:32:41.140
And I don't know how
many days or anything

00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:42.450
like that, but a lot.

00:32:42.450 --> 00:32:45.974
Because, as I might
have mentioned before,

00:32:45.974 --> 00:32:48.390
there's not a single recipe
in there that's actually mine.

00:32:48.390 --> 00:32:50.900
They've all been
collected somewhere,

00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:52.810
from someone who
actually uses them

00:32:52.810 --> 00:32:55.730
in their home, which is a really
important part of the book.

00:32:55.730 --> 00:33:00.076
And also because I photographed
all of the whole book

00:33:00.076 --> 00:33:01.450
when I was out
traveling as well.

00:33:01.450 --> 00:33:05.380
And that's something that you
couldn't commission someone

00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:06.880
to do that because
then you wouldn't

00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:09.430
get all those little moments
that happen when you're out

00:33:09.430 --> 00:33:11.430
traveling.

00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:13.992
So, yeah, a lot of travelling.

00:33:13.992 --> 00:33:16.089
AUDIENCE: Have any of the
recipes or ideas found

00:33:16.089 --> 00:33:17.867
their way back into
your restaurant?

00:33:17.867 --> 00:33:19.450
MAGNUS NILSSON: There
are definitely--

00:33:19.450 --> 00:33:21.130
so the question was
if any of the ideas

00:33:21.130 --> 00:33:25.260
have found their way
back into the restaurant.

00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:27.137
Definitely.

00:33:27.137 --> 00:33:29.470
And I think there's going to
be even more of that later,

00:33:29.470 --> 00:33:33.490
because the thing, when you
have a creative profession,

00:33:33.490 --> 00:33:36.490
I think what you produce is
a composite of everything

00:33:36.490 --> 00:33:37.713
that you have with you.

00:33:37.713 --> 00:33:41.350
And this being a very,
very large part of my,

00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:43.855
kind of, daily routine
for the last three years,

00:33:43.855 --> 00:33:45.700
it obviously becomes
a big part also

00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:47.270
of what I produce
at the restaurant.

00:33:47.270 --> 00:33:50.100
But I think there's going to
be, for several years to come,

00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:53.688
more and more showing
through the menu.

00:33:53.688 --> 00:33:57.330
Well, I have a really good team.

00:33:57.330 --> 00:33:58.960
And Faviken is
not quite as small

00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:02.880
as most people think it is,
because there are, actually,

00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:05.650
I have 47 employees in
total and 21 of them

00:34:05.650 --> 00:34:07.130
work in the restaurant.

00:34:07.130 --> 00:34:13.949
And they are the people
who execute the restaurant

00:34:13.949 --> 00:34:15.630
on a daily basis.

00:34:15.630 --> 00:34:18.344
And people tend to think, when
chefs start, it's this one guy

00:34:18.344 --> 00:34:19.719
and he's doing
all of this stuff.

00:34:19.719 --> 00:34:23.840
And then it's actually quite a
big company and lots of people

00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:27.820
that all work together to
produce the dining experience.

00:34:27.820 --> 00:34:30.889
And I'm just a small
part of the execution,

00:34:30.889 --> 00:34:33.650
even though I'm sort
of a bigger part

00:34:33.650 --> 00:34:39.230
of the creative process and
the quality control process.

00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:41.860
So alcoholic
beverages, in general,

00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:43.880
is something you'll
find everywhere.

00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:46.570
And people tend to
take whatever sugars

00:34:46.570 --> 00:34:49.820
they have, historically,
and turn them into alcohol

00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:52.040
that they can drink.

00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:56.699
Beer in the Nordic
region is not-- we

00:34:56.699 --> 00:34:57.990
don't have a huge beer culture.

00:34:57.990 --> 00:35:00.281
People think that we do
because we drink a lot of beer,

00:35:00.281 --> 00:35:02.520
and have done so for
the last 100 years.

00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:06.420
But it's not like-- because
grains up there, it's

00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:08.190
kind of on the margin
where grain grows.

00:35:08.190 --> 00:35:10.690
So grain was usually used
for bread or for porridge

00:35:10.690 --> 00:35:12.290
and things like that.

00:35:12.290 --> 00:35:16.000
And maybe, historically,
it was more mead,

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.080
the only source of
sugar, basically,

00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:20.200
that you had up there.

00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:21.880
And the beer
culture has probably

00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:25.230
come from central Europe during
the last 100 or 200 years,

00:35:25.230 --> 00:35:27.760
something like that.

00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:29.960
And you can see in the
whole region, as well,

00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:33.885
the way we consume
alcohol, there

00:35:33.885 --> 00:35:39.010
is one distinctive part
that is kind of beer.

00:35:39.010 --> 00:35:44.000
And one that's hard
liquor, being like a belt

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.730
across Finland
and Sweden, you'll

00:35:46.730 --> 00:35:50.520
have a bigger consumption of
hard liquor, traditionally,

00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:54.410
mainly produced from potato
or some kind of grain.

00:35:54.410 --> 00:35:58.050
And then Denmark and up
through the island nations

00:35:58.050 --> 00:36:00.710
you'll have more
of a beer culture.

00:36:00.710 --> 00:36:02.750
Thank you so much
for coming, everyone.

00:36:02.750 --> 00:36:07.300
[APPLAUSE]
