00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.190
So what is a medium fidelity prototype?

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:05.380
And how does it differ
from a paper prototype,

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:06.890
like the one you've been working with?

00:00:08.048 --> 00:00:09.890
The main difference that is relevant for

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:13.590
us at the moment, is the idea of
interactivity and clickability.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.090
When we worked with the paper prototype,
we had to indicate to users

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.570
what happened when they
clicked a given button, and

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.850
we had to be able to guide them when
they were confused by our layout.

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.350
For our next iteration,

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:29.480
we'll be building a clickable
interactive prototype.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.170
That means, that we could hand a user
the prototype, ask them to do a task and

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.130
then get out of the way.

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.930
When they click on the screen,
the app will move to the right place.

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.170
When they reach their destination,
it should be clear.

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.290
It's important to remember, that this
doesn't mean that we have a beautiful or

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:48.796
well designed prototype yet.

00:00:48.796 --> 00:00:50.902
We don't have animations.

00:00:50.902 --> 00:00:53.000
We don't have perfect lines set up.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.690
And we don't have a final look for
the app.

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.710
In fact, for our medium fidelity
prototype, it's possible to simply take

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.570
your paper prototype, draw it in
marker on a piece of paper, and

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.440
import it into a prototyping software.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.950
The key here is having primary
navigation points, which enable you to

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.640
get feedback on whether a user can
achieve your intended task of the app.
