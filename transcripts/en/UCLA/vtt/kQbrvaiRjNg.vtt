I came here in 1956.  UCLA needed someone
to take over on the teacher education program.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.460
The salary was terrible compared with anything.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.240
If I told you, you wouldn't believe me.It was so low.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.840
But I said I'd rather be here because I thought 
I could have more influence.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:42.120
And when I came here, it's been a tremendous opportunity.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:48.500
At the beginning when I came here there were 50 members of the School of Education.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.120
Now those 50 were scattered in every department.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:58.160
And what they were charged to do in their departments, in addition to their subject matter,

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:04.320
they had to help the students learn how to make
that subject matter meaningful

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.980
for children--students--in the school.

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:11.980
And then I would put them in various schools
 for practice teaching.

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:17.120
And I would help them write their lesson plans
and curriculum for the semester.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:25.080
This was really a training school for LA City teachers.
That's what it was.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:51.140
But, what is education? We don't know yet.
That's our topic right now in the United States.

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.380
Right in this building.

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.580
What what do we mean by education? 
What should it be?

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.420
Preparing just for a job?
Preparing for intellectual enlightenment?

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.520
What does it mean for your children?
What do you want them to be if they're educated?

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.180
I just love to see what students can do when you...

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:18.280
The main thing is opening up a opportunity
for them to learn and to teach us.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.320
I've enjoyed that more than
anything I think. I've really enjoyed it.
