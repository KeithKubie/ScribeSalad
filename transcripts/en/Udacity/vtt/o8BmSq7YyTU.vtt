00:00:00.394 --> 00:00:04.037
Another type of sale is an actual asset sale,

00:00:04.037 --> 00:00:07.126
direct sale. This is sale of ownership of the

00:00:07.126 --> 00:00:10.120
to a physical product. And in a physical channel

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.153
right some best examples are, you know, buying

00:00:12.153 --> 00:00:15.951
cars. Ford or General Motors or Nissan or

00:00:15.951 --> 00:00:19.794
going into a Walmart buying products in their

00:00:19.794 --> 00:00:23.171
massive stores, or going to your local hardware

00:00:23.171 --> 00:00:25.388
store and buying some thermometers.

00:00:25.388 --> 00:00:28.266
Or as we said earlier there could be a usage fee

00:00:28.266 --> 00:00:30.937
strategy and the fee is proportional to how much

00:00:30.937 --> 00:00:33.252
of the service you used. What’s an example of

00:00:33.252 --> 00:00:36.285
companies that do usage fees? Well every time

00:00:36.285 --> 00:00:39.049
you use your cell phone, either for voice or data

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:42.495
you are paying a fee proportional to the services

00:00:42.495 --> 00:00:45.811
or if you are a web developer, Amazon’s web

00:00:45.811 --> 00:00:48.947
service has been the kind of the reason why the

00:00:48.947 --> 00:00:50.857
web has exploded, because you no longer need to

00:00:50.857 --> 00:00:53.597
buy hardware, but you are paying per computing,

00:00:53.597 --> 00:00:57.244
or per database size or anything else . Or FedEx.

00:00:57.244 --> 00:00:59.945
You are now paying for every envelope or

00:00:59.945 --> 00:01:05.506
package you ship. Or what’s really interesting is

00:01:05.506 --> 00:01:08.926
electric power. It always used to be metered and

00:01:08.926 --> 00:01:11.759
proportional to the service. But now new solar

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:14.099
companies have decided that instead of selling

00:01:14.099 --> 00:01:16.526
solar panels, their business mode. It’s we’ll

00:01:16.526 --> 00:01:19.274
install the panel for free but we’ll also become a

00:01:19.274 --> 00:01:24.147
utility. These are usage fee revenue strategies.

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.620
Subscription fee, instead of paying per use,

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.679
why don’t we pay kind of a flat fee every month

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:33.864
for continuous access to a service. What’s an

00:01:33.864 --> 00:01:38.709
example of that? Well, Salesforce.com. We pay

00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:41.846
literally for a continued use of the product or

00:01:41.846 --> 00:01:45.140
maybe a better example is Netflix with all you

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.179
could eat downloads for videos. You want to

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:50.423
watch infinite number of movies; you pay just a

00:01:50.423 --> 00:01:51.942
flat subscription fee.

00:01:51.942 --> 00:01:55.182
There are other revenue models, like renting.

00:01:55.182 --> 00:01:58.487
We rent houses but the best example for me is

00:01:58.487 --> 00:02:01.602
Chegg in the book business. Now, all of a

00:02:01.602 --> 00:02:04.082
sudden I could temporarily rent books.

00:02:04.082 --> 00:02:07.531
Or BorrowLenses which says; listen instead of

00:02:07.531 --> 00:02:10.433
buying expensive camera gear which you might

00:02:10.433 --> 00:02:13.099
just use intermittently for photo shoots,

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:16.139
like expensive Hasselblads or expensive lenses,

00:02:16.139 --> 00:02:18.446
why don’t you just go in and rent them for a

00:02:18.446 --> 00:02:20.394
temporary amount of time.

00:02:20.394 --> 00:02:23.110
And of course in the U.S. and overseas,

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.209
car rentals are the example for transportation.

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:28.175
Instead of buying a car in every city,

00:02:28.175 --> 00:02:30.659
when you get off a plane, it’s very easy and we

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:32.879
just kind of take for granted that you could have

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:36.527
temporary access to automobiles, drive them for

00:02:36.527 --> 00:02:39.041
hours or days and return them. Another type of

00:02:39.041 --> 00:02:43.065
revenue model is licensing. It’s a fee for use for

00:02:43.065 --> 00:02:45.939
intellectual property, IP.

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:48.464
What’s an example of using somebody’s IP,

00:02:48.464 --> 00:02:51.644
I cant think of one. Well if you’ve ever used any

00:02:51.644 --> 00:02:54.642
software from any computer manufacturer,

00:02:54.642 --> 00:02:57.889
congratulations if you ever read the fine print

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:00.135
from Microsoft or Electronic Arts or even

00:03:00.135 --> 00:03:02.985
Apple, you don’t own your software. You are

00:03:02.985 --> 00:03:06.685
actually using it under a license. Surprise, that

00:03:06.685 --> 00:03:10.419
means you can’t duplicate it and make a million

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:12.849
copies and give it away to your fiends.

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:15.998
You have agreed with Microsoft or Electronic

00:03:15.998 --> 00:03:19.033
Arts that you are just licensing it for use on one

00:03:19.033 --> 00:03:21.167
computer or if they are feeling generous this

00:03:21.167 --> 00:03:24.168
year, maybe your laptop and your phone and

00:03:24.168 --> 00:03:26.566
one desktop machine, but you do not have

00:03:26.566 --> 00:03:29.588
infinite rights to their intellectual property.

00:03:29.588 --> 00:03:32.401
Another type of revenue strategy could be an

00:03:32.401 --> 00:03:35.150
intermediation fee. Now sometimes we find this

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.697
in marketplaces and it’s a fee for bringing two

00:03:39.697 --> 00:03:43.045
parties together involved in a transaction.

00:03:43.045 --> 00:03:45.337
What’s an example, well the most popular one

00:03:45.337 --> 00:03:48.581
right now is, Airbnb, they don’t own all those

00:03:48.581 --> 00:03:51.633
places they are renting, but what they do is

00:03:51.633 --> 00:03:55.095
essentially a dating service between you and

00:03:55.095 --> 00:03:57.511
somebody who wants to make money in renting

00:03:57.511 --> 00:03:59.643
their apartment for a night or a couple of nights.

00:03:59.643 --> 00:04:01.568
So you are the traveler who will need a place to

00:04:01.568 --> 00:04:03.253
stay, but don’t want to stay in an expensive

00:04:03.253 --> 00:04:06.522
hotel, use their site an intermediary.

00:04:06.522 --> 00:04:11.108
Or Etsy, or even better CafePress or E*TRADE,

00:04:11.108 --> 00:04:14.106
all these are kind of brokers. And by the way in

00:04:14.106 --> 00:04:17.149
the physical world the classic is real estate

00:04:17.149 --> 00:04:19.377
brokers. And they don’t own the house and they

00:04:19.377 --> 00:04:21.409
don’t own you, but they’re a match making

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:24.460
service between you and the property you want

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.893
to buys. Another strategy for revenue stream

00:04:27.893 --> 00:04:29.395
could be adverting.

00:04:29.395 --> 00:04:31.827
So, again if you remember our conversation

00:04:31.827 --> 00:04:34.878
about Google, Google’s strategy in Facebook

00:04:34.878 --> 00:04:38.810
and Spice and Mint, it’s all about creating

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.659
massive numbers of user. So I could monetize

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:47.908
fancy name for make from all those users not

00:04:47.908 --> 00:04:50.578
from making them pay, because the last time I

00:04:50.578 --> 00:04:52.194
looked at Google, searched it, it didn’t cost me

00:04:52.194 --> 00:04:55.104
anything directly. But Google is actually using

00:04:55.104 --> 00:04:58.329
me to sell to advertisers. They’re saying, hey,

00:04:58.329 --> 00:05:01.044
you want to get in front of people like Steve,

00:05:01.044 --> 00:05:04.393
all you have to do is pay us for access to these

00:05:04.393 --> 00:05:07.306
groups of individual and in fact if we’re very

00:05:07.306 --> 00:05:09.454
sophisticated, we could segment them by

00:05:09.454 --> 00:05:13.000
specific words or interest.
