00:00:00.621 --> 00:00:02.279
- [David] Hello grammarians, hello Rosie!

00:00:02.279 --> 00:00:03.354
- [Rosie] Hi, David.

00:00:03.354 --> 00:00:05.396
- [David] We're gonna be
talking about what we call

00:00:05.396 --> 00:00:07.793
the spectrum of formality today,

00:00:07.793 --> 00:00:10.678
in the context of language style.

00:00:10.678 --> 00:00:14.681
Balancing your style between
formal and informal language,

00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:17.392
when it's appropriate, is
just a general life skill,

00:00:17.392 --> 00:00:20.083
but it's also something
that's tested on the SAT.

00:00:20.083 --> 00:00:24.041
- [Rosie] And you can check
out KhanAcademy.org/SAT

00:00:24.041 --> 00:00:25.501
to find out more about that.

00:00:25.501 --> 00:00:27.330
- [David] So, when we talk about formal

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.581
versus informal language, what
we're really talking about

00:00:30.581 --> 00:00:33.081
is this thing called register.

00:00:35.323 --> 00:00:37.656
What is appropriate for the,

00:00:38.951 --> 00:00:41.218
whether it's like a social occasion,

00:00:41.218 --> 00:00:44.955
or a style of writing that
you're attempting to do,

00:00:44.955 --> 00:00:49.119
you know, what register
should you speak in?

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:51.702
So let me give you an example.

00:00:51.702 --> 00:00:56.413
Gary Evans, the esteemed
chairman of the board, is blank.

00:00:56.413 --> 00:00:57.596
Right, we have this sentence we want

00:00:57.596 --> 00:00:59.558
to fill in this blank with something.

00:00:59.558 --> 00:01:01.833
There are a couple of
ways we could do this.

00:01:01.833 --> 00:01:03.061
We could say,

00:01:03.061 --> 00:01:06.028
Gary Evans, the esteemed
chairman of the board,

00:01:06.028 --> 00:01:08.028
is a pretty decent dude.

00:01:10.557 --> 00:01:14.852
Now, there are a couple
of things that tell me

00:01:14.852 --> 00:01:19.019
that a pretty decent dude is
not stylistically appropriate

00:01:21.224 --> 00:01:22.724
for this sentence.

00:01:24.476 --> 00:01:28.335
And it's both that we're
applying the adjective esteemed

00:01:28.335 --> 00:01:30.713
to Gary, and that we're giving him

00:01:30.713 --> 00:01:33.526
this high highfalutin title,
chairman of the board,

00:01:33.526 --> 00:01:35.475
and so probably, in this situation,

00:01:35.475 --> 00:01:36.655
we wouldn't wanna say,

00:01:36.655 --> 00:01:39.206
we wouldn't wanna use this kind of slangy,

00:01:39.206 --> 00:01:42.570
informal language, pretty decent dude.

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.024
- [Rosie] Right, there's
a level of respect

00:01:44.024 --> 00:01:45.751
that we're conveying with

00:01:45.751 --> 00:01:48.767
this esteemed chairman of the board.

00:01:48.767 --> 00:01:51.093
- [David] So instead, well, I don't know,

00:01:51.093 --> 00:01:54.232
Rosie, what's another thing
we could put in there?

00:01:54.232 --> 00:01:55.503
- [Rosie] Let's say, Gary Evans,

00:01:55.503 --> 00:01:57.097
the esteemed chairman of the board,

00:01:57.097 --> 00:01:59.992
is a renowned philanthropist.

00:01:59.992 --> 00:02:01.607
- [David] Oh!

00:02:01.607 --> 00:02:04.015
A renowned philanthropist.

00:02:04.015 --> 00:02:06.402
So, in addition to being like a large,

00:02:06.402 --> 00:02:08.576
four-dollar word, philanthropist is a word

00:02:08.576 --> 00:02:12.631
that just means, like, someone
who literally loves people,

00:02:12.631 --> 00:02:16.398
and this refers to
generosity of this person.

00:02:16.398 --> 00:02:17.972
And so we can tell by the respect

00:02:17.972 --> 00:02:19.882
that we are according
this person by the use

00:02:19.882 --> 00:02:21.304
of the word esteemed,

00:02:21.304 --> 00:02:23.277
that renowned philanthropist

00:02:23.277 --> 00:02:26.760
probably an appropriate
set of words to use

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.182
to describe this man.

00:02:28.182 --> 00:02:29.381
But what we just showed you was an example

00:02:29.381 --> 00:02:31.677
of being insufficiently formal.

00:02:31.677 --> 00:02:35.406
Here's what it looks like
if you're too formal.

00:02:35.406 --> 00:02:37.967
- [Rosie] Please join
us for little Philip's

00:02:37.967 --> 00:02:40.425
first birthday celebration.

00:02:40.425 --> 00:02:43.154
This festive occasion
will include an abundance

00:02:43.154 --> 00:02:47.333
of delightful diversions
in which you can partake.

00:02:47.333 --> 00:02:50.340
- [David] This is a little
boy's birthday party.

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.076
(both chuckling)

00:02:52.076 --> 00:02:53.408
- [Rosie] Let's get a hold of ourselves.

00:02:53.408 --> 00:02:56.821
- [David] Let's, you know,
this is not a steak dinner.

00:02:56.821 --> 00:02:58.505
Maybe reel it in.

00:02:58.505 --> 00:03:00.316
You have to tailor the content

00:03:00.316 --> 00:03:01.433
of what you're trying to write

00:03:01.433 --> 00:03:03.230
to it's context, right?

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:04.063
- [Rosie] Right.

00:03:04.063 --> 00:03:07.854
- [David] Like how fancy
is the first birthday party

00:03:07.854 --> 00:03:09.845
of a little boy going to be?

00:03:09.845 --> 00:03:12.175
Rosie, have you been to a
child's first birthday party

00:03:12.175 --> 00:03:13.008
as an adult?

00:03:13.008 --> 00:03:13.841
- [Rosie] I have, I have.

00:03:13.841 --> 00:03:14.994
It was not this fancy.

00:03:14.994 --> 00:03:15.827
- [David] No.

00:03:15.827 --> 00:03:16.862
- [Rosie] But it wasn't, you know,

00:03:16.862 --> 00:03:19.302
the prince of a country or something.

00:03:19.302 --> 00:03:20.338
- [David] Right, like, okay,

00:03:20.338 --> 00:03:23.670
I'll give you a pass
if, like, little Philip

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.762
is the prince of your nation.

00:03:25.762 --> 00:03:26.595
- [Rosie] Yes.

00:03:26.595 --> 00:03:28.627
- [David] Otherwise, like,

00:03:28.627 --> 00:03:30.372
this first sentence is fine,

00:03:30.372 --> 00:03:32.000
please join us for little Philip's

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.716
first birthday celebration.

00:03:33.716 --> 00:03:35.413
This festive occasion
will include an abundance

00:03:35.413 --> 00:03:37.690
of delightful diversions
in which you can partake,

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:38.869
maybe a little much.

00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:42.088
So if we were going to rewrite this,

00:03:42.088 --> 00:03:45.138
I would probably tone down
the language a little bit,

00:03:45.138 --> 00:03:47.221
and just ratchet it back.

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.290
I might even go so far
as to say, lil Philip.

00:03:54.177 --> 00:03:55.935
- [Rosie] I like it.

00:03:55.935 --> 00:03:57.468
- [David] Maybe throw
in an exclamation point

00:03:57.468 --> 00:03:59.703
because we're excited.

00:03:59.703 --> 00:04:02.100
This just seems, this language
seems a little stuffy,

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.457
even the word describing a party,

00:04:04.457 --> 00:04:08.540
it seems very emotionally
removed from partiness.

00:04:11.711 --> 00:04:13.022
- [Rosie] Oh, that's much better.

00:04:13.022 --> 00:04:13.875
- [David] Thank you.

00:04:13.875 --> 00:04:16.700
So, please join us for lil
Philip's first birthday party.

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.115
It's going to be fun:
we'll have cake and games.

00:04:19.115 --> 00:04:21.698
Let us know if you can make it.

00:04:22.908 --> 00:04:24.867
We're taking this content,

00:04:24.867 --> 00:04:27.094
there's an abundance of
delightful diversions,

00:04:27.094 --> 00:04:29.176
which, I suppose at a
first birthday party,

00:04:29.176 --> 00:04:32.593
would probably, again, be cake and games.

00:04:33.625 --> 00:04:35.422
There's not really that much

00:04:35.422 --> 00:04:38.490
that a one year old can do at a party.

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:39.375
- [Rosie] That's true.

00:04:39.375 --> 00:04:42.586
- [David] So we're taking this,

00:04:42.586 --> 00:04:45.227
high register, this
formal register language

00:04:45.227 --> 00:04:49.636
and then just kinda dialing
it back a couple of notches.

00:04:49.636 --> 00:04:52.887
So we've got formal on this side,

00:04:52.887 --> 00:04:54.614
informal over here.

00:04:54.614 --> 00:04:57.947
You're here, you wanna be at about here.

00:04:58.887 --> 00:05:01.571
The main thing, your main indicator

00:05:01.571 --> 00:05:04.285
for whether or not language
is formal or informal

00:05:04.285 --> 00:05:07.951
is the kind of vocabulary
that you choose to deploy.

00:05:07.951 --> 00:05:09.608
So the more informal you are,

00:05:09.608 --> 00:05:13.405
the more likely you are
to use silly vocabulary

00:05:13.405 --> 00:05:15.001
or made up words.

00:05:15.001 --> 00:05:16.209
- [Rosie] And contractions.

00:05:16.209 --> 00:05:17.723
- [David] Contractions.

00:05:17.723 --> 00:05:20.640
So the more informal, contractions,

00:05:23.891 --> 00:05:24.724
slang,

00:05:26.167 --> 00:05:27.000
profanity.

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:30.645
I mean, look, we here at Khan Academy,

00:05:30.645 --> 00:05:33.774
we're not advising you to
curse all over the place,

00:05:33.774 --> 00:05:37.716
but if you must, do it in
an informal setting, right?

00:05:37.716 --> 00:05:38.711
- Right.
- Like, formal settings

00:05:38.711 --> 00:05:40.795
are not suitable for obscenity,

00:05:40.795 --> 00:05:43.545
that's why it's called obscenity.

00:05:44.827 --> 00:05:47.560
And then the more formal
your language becomes,

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:52.275
the more likely your vocabulary
is to become more complex

00:05:52.275 --> 00:05:53.525
or specialized,

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:57.566
like if I were, let's
say if I were a doctor,

00:05:57.566 --> 00:06:01.243
and I were addressing
a doctors' convention,

00:06:01.243 --> 00:06:03.844
I would probably use a
lot of doctor language,

00:06:03.844 --> 00:06:06.344
right, like specialized vocab.

00:06:07.907 --> 00:06:10.099
The more formal you are,
as Rosie was saying,

00:06:10.099 --> 00:06:13.425
the more less likely you
are to use contractions,

00:06:13.425 --> 00:06:15.258
so full constructions?

00:06:17.852 --> 00:06:20.333
An example of that would be,

00:06:20.333 --> 00:06:23.692
on the informal side of the
scale, you might say can't,

00:06:23.692 --> 00:06:27.139
where the formal you would say cannot.

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:30.275
- [Rosie] Yeah, I think the
other side of the profanity

00:06:30.275 --> 00:06:33.486
is potentially more respectful,

00:06:33.486 --> 00:06:35.916
depending on who you're speaking with.

00:06:35.916 --> 00:06:38.416
So, you might address someone,

00:06:39.805 --> 00:06:42.985
you know, you might
address someone as sir.

00:06:42.985 --> 00:06:44.608
- [David] Formal language generally means

00:06:44.608 --> 00:06:46.611
a more respectful form of address,

00:06:46.611 --> 00:06:48.967
so if I were to say, like,

00:06:48.967 --> 00:06:51.506
on the informal side, yo buddy!

00:06:51.506 --> 00:06:53.214
It's extremely informal,

00:06:53.214 --> 00:06:55.714
as opposed to, excuse me, sir.

00:06:57.126 --> 00:06:59.360
That's quite formal.

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:02.375
So yeah, I guess the big take away here,

00:07:02.375 --> 00:07:05.912
Rosie, right, is just
consider your context.

00:07:05.912 --> 00:07:07.537
- [Rosie] Exactly.

00:07:07.537 --> 00:07:11.601
You're taking a look at the
situation that you're in,

00:07:11.601 --> 00:07:13.990
and considering what kind of language

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:16.579
is going to be appropriate
in that situation.

00:07:16.579 --> 00:07:19.199
Is it going to be informal,
talking to your friend,

00:07:19.199 --> 00:07:22.076
or is it a formal dinner party

00:07:22.076 --> 00:07:25.295
where you would use different vocabulary

00:07:25.295 --> 00:07:28.200
and more formal language.

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:32.113
- [David] The way our colleague
Grant described it to me,

00:07:32.113 --> 00:07:33.677
is this:

00:07:33.677 --> 00:07:36.266
it's useful to have a
tuxedo in your closet,

00:07:36.266 --> 00:07:38.662
but you wouldn't wear it to a beach party.

00:07:38.662 --> 00:07:40.162
- [Rosie] Exactly!

00:07:41.531 --> 00:07:44.781
- [David] So reserve your
formal and informal language

00:07:44.781 --> 00:07:47.078
for contexts when it is necessary.

00:07:47.078 --> 00:07:50.166
Just like you wouldn't wear formal shoes

00:07:50.166 --> 00:07:51.249
to the beach,

00:07:52.572 --> 00:07:54.451
neither would you show up,

00:07:54.451 --> 00:07:58.618
you know, in flip flops before
a joint session of Congress.

00:07:58.618 --> 00:08:00.161
- [Rosie] Exactly.

00:08:00.161 --> 00:08:01.959
- [David] Whether you're
writing or speaking,

00:08:01.959 --> 00:08:05.445
always consider your context,
consider your audience,

00:08:05.445 --> 00:08:09.612
and from that, consider the
way that you deploy language.

00:08:10.452 --> 00:08:11.682
You can learn anything.

00:08:11.682 --> 00:08:12.515
David out!

00:08:12.515 --> 00:08:13.397
- [Rosie] Rosie out!
