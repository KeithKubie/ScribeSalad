00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:04.170
I will be the first to admit that math was
not my favorite subject in school, in fact

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.080
it made me HELLA anxious.

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.770
But I’ve definitely warmed to it, especially
ever since I heard about the Ham Sandwich

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:14.269
theorem--what, a girl loves to eat!--oh, and
also the fact that it might help us better

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:16.039
understand our universe, but whatever.

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:18.849
Let’s take a step back and start with pancakes.

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:23.390
A bit of a departure from the universe and
ham sandwiches, but this smorgasboard will

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.660
eventually all make sense, I promise.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.230
The pancake theorem states that if I have
a pancake on a plate, there’s at least one

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.650
cut that I can make to divide that pancake
in half.

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:32.650
Simple.

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.630
If I add another pancake on the plate, no
matter where it is there’s going to be at

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.590
least one cut that I can make through both
of them that will allow me to divide both

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:41.590
pancakes in half.

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:42.810
Again, simple enough, right?

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:48.080
But, that’s because the pancake theorem
technically only deals in 2-dimensional space,

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.440
like these pancakes that we’re talking about
are perfectly flat, as if they were pancakes

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.961
that we’ve drawn on a piece of paper.

00:00:53.961 --> 00:00:58.740
The Ham Sandwich theorem takes the concept
and moves it into 3-dimensions, the world

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.260
we actually live in.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.770
Ok, I’m about to drop a math formula on
you here, but I want you to stay calm and

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:04.770
stay with me, ok?

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:07.180
Here we go *brings up piece of paper and read
off it*: the ham sandwich theorem states that

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.310
given n measurable objects in n-dimensional
Euclidean space, it is possible to divide

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.370
all of the objects in half (with respect to
their volume) with a single (n-1)-dimensional

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:19.460
hyperplane .
Yeah, I know.

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.100
I read that sentence when I was first researching
this video and was just like, ‘No. there’s

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.100
no way.”

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.590
BUT it turns out this convoluted statement
actually expresses something remarkably simple

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.820
and useful, so I want you to come on an imaginary
adventure with me.

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.960
Say we have a ham sandwich.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.790
That’s our n-measurable objects, our 3 measurable
things: 2 slices of bread and 1 slice of ham.

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.900
(We’re being stingy with the ham, ok?)

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.300
In 3-dimensional space, it’s possible to
use a single cut to divide the sandwich in

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.060
half, no matter where the 3 items are.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.240
Now, this doesn’t JUST mean that a sandwich
AS A WHOLE can be halved.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.740
If we’re defining the sandwich as our 3
items (bread, bread, and ham), even if we

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.100
dropped our sandwich on the floor and the
three items were all over the place, we could

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.060
draw one line that would divide the entire
volume of the sandwich in two.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.609
But it ALSO means, and this is where it gets
real cool, that each individual item of the

00:02:11.609 --> 00:02:19.079
in the sandwich, no matter where they are
in space, can be divided perfectly in two.

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:23.129
This part is easier to picture if we get rid
of gravity and picture the pieces of our ham

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:24.359
sandwich floating in the air.

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:28.270
Doesn’t matter where, they could be right
next to each other or on opposite ends of

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:33.549
the universe and there is still at least one
magic plane that could bisect all of the ingredients

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:35.500
perfectly, with one cut.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.680
Ok, so this is cool and made us do some fun
mental gymnastics, but I’m never going to

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.310
drop my ham sandwich on the floor and then
whip out my calculator like, “lemme find

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.400
the magic line that divides all these in two”.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.409
So exactly how is this important or useful?

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:53.910
Well, a paper that came out a few years ago
wanted to explore exactly that, and came to

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:59.090
some cool conclusions, stating that “At
any given instant of time, there is one planet,

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.980
one moon and one asteroid in our solar system
with a single plane touching all three that

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.300
exactly bisects the total planetary mass,
the total lunar mass, and the total asteroidal

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:10.799
mass of the solar system.”

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:14.099
*mind blown gesture and noise*
All of this is to say, theoretical mathematics

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:18.390
like this helps us understand the very nature
of the way the universe behaves.

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.139
We can use things like the ham sandwich theorem,
along with our understanding of physics and

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:27.430
the natural sciences, to help us make computer
simulations of everything from atomic phenomena

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.659
to the movement of celestial bodies.

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:32.219
Man, the world is crazy and beautiful.

00:03:32.219 --> 00:03:36.599
And who knew that talking about ham sandwiches
could turn this former math-phobe into, dare

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:38.650
I say, a math enthusiast.

And just FYI, the original creator of the
ham sandwich theorem was named Hugo Steinhaus,

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:58.150
and worked out this problem while hiding from
the Nazis in a Polish farmhouse during WWII.

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:59.150
BADASS.

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.430
I’m Maren, thanks for watching Seeker.
