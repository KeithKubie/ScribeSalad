00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:10.560
They’ve gone – and what we need most of
all to understand is why? What is striking

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:17.820
is that, despite what friends and well-meaning
acquaintances tell us, we already know. It

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:24.579
is us. We firmly and naturally assume that
the explanation is primarily to do with us

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:29.640
and our miserable failings. They’ve gone
because we weren’t good enough. They got

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.989
to know us better than almost anyone has ever
done – and then, inevitably, felt horrified

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:41.539
by the truth. It’s not the relationship
that failed: we failed. But – counterintuitively

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:48.660
– what seems most obvious to us in our hearts
might not actually be true in reality. There

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.910
is a famous experiment in the history of psychology
which pinpoints our tendency to project: that

00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:02.320
is, to read decisive, clear explanations drawn
from our minds into what are in fact ambiguous

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:09.180
situations in the world. The Thematic Apperception
test, as it’s technically known, was developed

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.420
in the 1930s by the American psychologist
Henry Murray. It presents us with images of

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:20.920
people – and asks us to say what’s going
on in them.People tend to come to quite specific

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:27.420
conclusions. For example:
She’d fed up with him; he’s weak and a

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.580
bit boring and she’s just told him that
their relationship isn’t working and that

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.490
she’s leaving.
He’s just told her they have to break up

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.550
and the reason has something to do with their
sex lives. He’s not as fulfilled as he wants

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.229
to be.
It seems to be about his parents. She wants

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.190
him to take more distance from them. If he
doesn’t, she can’t be expected to stay

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.649
around forever…
The power of the experiment derives from the

00:01:52.649 --> 00:02:02.119
fact that the image has, by design, no precise
or definite significance: they’re just actors

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:11.980
asked to assume certain poses. The stories
and the meanings come from us. This is often

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.510
exactly what happens around our own heartbreaks.
We may never actually know precisely why the

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.090
other person left us. That shouldn’t be
surprising. However well we know someone,

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.670
they are never fully transparent to us. What
they say may only be a part of what’s really

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.489
in their minds. Their deeper motives will
remain obscure – perhaps even to them. We’re

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:38.481
presented with a fact – they’ve left us
– and onto that we project a meaning. But

00:02:38.481 --> 00:02:45.220
the meaning we give to that fact comes, in
large part, from us. Holding onto the idea

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.849
that we don’t actually know something is
an underused and powerful skill. At one of

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:55.569
the foundational moment of philosophy, in
ancient Athens, Socrates argued that a huge

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:01.300
component of wisdom lies in our capacity to
accept our ignorance in certain situations:

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:08.950
‘the wise are those who know that they don’t
know’. This recognition of not-knowing,

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:14.250
and the reminder of our tendency to project,
may be helpful in easing us away form the

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:21.040
more catastrophic and self-incriminating interpretations
of a break up. The lover who furiously told

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.810
us they never wanted to see us again may – in
the hidden recesses of their soul – have

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.790
been actually thinking: ‘I’m so sad this
didn’t work out; I wish I could find a way

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.159
to make this work; you are so lovely in many
ways, but there’s something desperate in

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:41.370
me that’s turning away from your offer of
love’. The person who coldly texts us: ‘that‘s

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:47.549
it, I’m out’ may behind the scenes be
weeping at their own sense of loss and failure

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:53.049
rather than (as we imagine) gleefully celebrating
the end of their over-extended encounter with

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:57.989
us. The person who says: ‘I wish this could
work but just for now I’ve got to concentrate

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:04.470
on my career’ might actually be quite sincere
rather than (as we might darkly suppose) putting

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:11.090
a polite cover over their contempt for us.
The acceptance of ambiguity is liberating:

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:17.230
we’re free to recognise that the ending
wasn’t necessarily all our fault; that there

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:22.861
may have been forces at work other than our
own inadequacy. We’re still very sad, but

00:04:22.861 --> 00:04:29.090
the target of our misery is a little more
bearable: we can focus on the deep, sorrowful

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:36.360
strangeness of love and loss rather than suffering
an extended excoriating confrontation with

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.360
our own inadequacies.

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:49.280
