00:00:25.672 --> 00:00:27.380
NATALIE KULDELL: So
we are among friends,

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.830
please call me Natalie,
please interrupt me as I go.

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:36.000
Elizabeth has given a very nice
framework for-- the high level

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.270
questions about this
next little bit of time

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.956
are things about creating
a scalable educational

00:00:41.956 --> 00:00:43.330
experience, and
things like that.

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.150
But truth be told,
this is really

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.650
going to be me,
my dirty laundry,

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:49.520
telling you all
the mistakes I've

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.080
made in developing something
that I thought seemed

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.520
like a good idea at the time.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.700
How's that as the sort of
tag line for this talk?

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.760
It seemed like a good
idea at the time.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.150
But maybe, just so that you
don't go running from the room

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.170
and think this is going
to be all disaster,

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.620
I will start by showing you
where this has ended up.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.820
Because where all this
meandering and mistake-making

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.000
has brought me is to
something that I'm actually

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.580
pretty proud of, and that
seems to be reasonably useful.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.860
I don't think this is the final
form of what this will take,

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.040
but let's start with
where it ends up,

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.610
and then we'll rewind the
tape and go from the beginning

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.130
to get it back to here.

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:38.600
So BioBuilder is now a
nonprofit organization

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:44.620
that I am founder of, I have
a wonderful board of directors

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.920
that help protect
me and my time,

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:54.290
and help me make good decisions
about protecting just thinking

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.460
through the business questions,
and the strategic questions,

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.050
and the wisdom questions
that are involved in running

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.870
a nonprofit organization.

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:07.650
It came about because I thought
that the teaching I was doing

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.070
here at MIT, in the Department
of Biological Engineering,

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.310
was such a great way
to teach and to learn.

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.840
I was having so much fun drawing
on current research questions

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.870
from the department, and
using the questions that

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.840
existed to teach
the engineering,

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.230
and using the engineering to
teach the science behind it.

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.040
So I'm a scientist by
training, not an engineer.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.842
In fact, I didn't
really even appreciate

00:02:35.842 --> 00:02:37.800
the distinction between
science and engineering

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:43.000
until I got to MIT 12 years
ago, or something like that.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.776
I really like learning
about how the world works.

00:02:45.776 --> 00:02:47.650
What I discovered when
I got here and started

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.520
teaching this way
to the undergrads

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.170
was that, by building
stuff made from biology,

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.060
you learn a lot
about how it works.

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.120
And so I really just wanted
to more broadly distribute

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.860
that content to students who
wanted to learn this way,

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.450
and to teachers who
wanted to teach this way.

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.840
Pretty simple-- not
that wise, maybe,

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.800
but that's what I've
organized this around.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.930
And so there is a
nonprofit organization that

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.920
is called the BioBuilder
Educational Foundation which

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:29.250
has, as I say, a board
of directors, partners,

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.640
we have publications and
newsletters and things

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:33.960
like that.

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:38.440
We are a 501(c)3, and
we were founded in 2011.

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.570
The funding for
this organization

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:43.840
came from the National
Science Foundation.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:49.370
They awarded MIT, Harvard,
Stanford, UC Berkeley,

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.930
and UCSF-- a consortium
of five institutions--

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:55.136
10 years' worth of funding.

00:03:55.136 --> 00:03:56.760
From the NSF, that's
really unheard of.

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.620
And I thought, as the
educational director

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.500
on the East Coast for
this, with 10 years

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.880
of funding we could do
something really, really cool.

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.650
And so what that
started with were

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.760
animations, which is why I'm
here talking to you today.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.270
What those animations
have been connected into

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:18.839
is a curriculum
for students that

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:21.519
has a number of hands-on
laboratory activities.

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:25.030
So for example, this
one is for students.

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.470
These bubbles that are here
link to the animations,

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.010
but the content
that's on the website

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:36.080
is some introductory content,
laboratory procedures,

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:40.730
lab report information, and then
a portal for sharing your data

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:43.370
once you've collected it.

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:48.250
There's also a teacher's
component to this website,

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:51.810
so that teachers, if they wanted
to start teaching this content,

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:56.340
would have classroom
materials like PowerPoints

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:00.720
to introduce the content,
videos about introducing

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.610
synthetic biology-- which is
what the focus of these labs

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.570
are-- and then
components for the lab

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:09.080
introductory PowerPoints
and things like that.

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.510
So this is a website
that has information

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:14.040
about the nonprofit
organization,

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.120
it has curricular content for
the students-- which are mostly

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.320
high school students and
some college students--

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.060
and then it also has
a portal for teachers.

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:24.160
We run teacher
workshops in the summers

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.127
to train teachers how to
teach this in the classroom,

00:05:27.127 --> 00:05:28.460
and how to teach other teachers.

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:29.372
Yes?

00:05:29.372 --> 00:05:32.700
AUDIENCE: So one of the things
we talked about yesterday was

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.700
this notion of a
video being something

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:40.300
more than the experience of just
pressing play and finishing it,

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:43.786
that a video is meant
to spark an ending, that

00:05:43.786 --> 00:05:48.516
is the conversation that
happens on comments on YouTube--

00:05:48.516 --> 00:05:51.940
we focused a lot on YouTube
and social-media based video.

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:56.324
What is, I guess, the ending
or the goal-- or what's

00:05:56.324 --> 00:05:58.611
your vision what an ending
looks like for things

00:05:58.611 --> 00:05:59.800
like BioBuilder?

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.092
And what's your user pipeline?

00:06:02.092 --> 00:06:03.550
Because for us,
we're talking a lot

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:06.050
about people who are
exploring the internet

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:08.802
and finding things that
spark their curiosity

00:06:08.802 --> 00:06:09.830
or love of learning.

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:12.032
I would imagine that
something like BioBuilder,

00:06:12.032 --> 00:06:15.360
you have a very focused pipeline
that's maybe more looking

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:16.692
at classrooms?

00:06:16.692 --> 00:06:18.150
NATALIE KULDELL:
So the distinction

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:21.100
you just made between
the focused pipeline

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:24.870
and the user exploring
through the internet,

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:26.780
is a distinction
that I did not know

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:29.860
when I started this project, but
that has become really clear.

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:33.260
So the pipeline
for this is really

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.580
intended to be formal
education setting--

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:39.345
so I don't know if when you
took high school biology,

00:06:39.345 --> 00:06:41.650
you took advanced placement
biology or something like

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:44.350
that, there are this
series of lessons and labs.

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:47.950
And these are intended to fit
squarely into formal education

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:51.750
settings, where teachers
have content that they need

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:55.860
to cover, hands-on labs that
teach techniques as well

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:58.550
as investigative
questions, and then writing

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:01.340
and points to
communicate their work.

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:03.580
Originally-- and maybe
this is a good segue

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:07.350
into to how this really
started-- this was my notion.

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:10.920
I don't know if you've ever seen
this website-- I'm sure many

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:13.900
of you have-- BrainPOP.

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:16.000
This was what I thought
the animations were

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.280
going to fit into.

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:19.990
This is kind of the
explore the internet

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:22.620
depending on what
you're curious about

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:25.820
kind of sense of the animations
that are in BioBuilder.

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:30.040
So cellular life in
genetics-- and maybe

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:32.370
in watching cellular life
in genetics, a person

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:34.720
would get interested
in something

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.350
in particular--
cloning, or whatever.

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:40.330
And so this is a very
rich library of animations

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:45.044
that a person can self-navigate
through, and learn content

00:07:45.044 --> 00:07:46.710
that they're particularly
interested in.

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:49.260
And I imagined, when I
started this project,

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:53.120
that I would build a library of
videos that looked like this.

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:54.561
That is not where
I have ended up.

00:07:54.561 --> 00:07:56.060
That was, in fact,
really misguided.

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:57.857
Yeah?

00:07:57.857 --> 00:08:01.849
AUDIENCE: My question is--
you're in the kind of structure

00:08:01.849 --> 00:08:04.344
and giving this to
students and teachers,

00:08:04.344 --> 00:08:06.994
how do you choose
what to pick as a--

00:08:06.994 --> 00:08:08.160
NATALIE KULDELL: As a topic?

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:10.740
Right, so I work with
high school teachers

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:12.352
every summer to
decide on the topics.

00:08:12.352 --> 00:08:14.060
The very first thing
that the high school

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:16.351
teachers I've worked with
told me was that they did not

00:08:16.351 --> 00:08:19.647
have more time in their
day to teach other stuff,

00:08:19.647 --> 00:08:21.230
but that they did
feel that they could

00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:23.550
teach what they were
teaching in a better

00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:24.850
way, in a more effective way.

00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:28.350
And they thought engineering was
a great lens to teach biology,

00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:31.848
in particular, and these
current research questions.

00:08:31.848 --> 00:08:34.380
AUDIENCE: And they're giving
you the concept that has to be

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:36.387
covered, and you're coming
up with the example that--

00:08:36.387 --> 00:08:38.443
are they saying, it would
be nice if we could use this

00:08:38.443 --> 00:08:39.054
example for--

00:08:39.054 --> 00:08:40.970
NATALIE KULDELL: So it's
more of a partnership

00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:42.980
than that, because what
I'll do is I'll say,

00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:44.860
here's a really
interesting system that

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:47.860
has an ongoing question
associated with it-- how do

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:49.720
you reliably engineer a cell?

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:56.020
How do you improve
gain in a system?

00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:57.070
Something like that.

00:08:57.070 --> 00:08:58.800
And they'll say,
oh, well, you know,

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:00.550
I don't really know
much about that topic,

00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:02.799
but I have always had trouble
teaching photosynthesis.

00:09:02.799 --> 00:09:05.030
So is there a way that we
could teach that question

00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:06.650
and cover photosynthesis.

00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:09.340
So I'll say, well, in a plant
cell, we could do it this way.

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:11.100
So it's more of
a give and take--

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:13.490
what they have
challenges teaching,

00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:15.840
and what are the
ongoing research

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:19.020
questions in this field.

00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:22.030
So this kind of BrainPOP
kind of meandering

00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:23.860
through a library
of videos is what

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:26.080
I imagined I would be
creating at the beginning

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:29.240
of this 10-year NSF funding.

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:33.240
What I had not
appreciated was how long

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:37.740
it takes to make each video, how
hard it is to make each video,

00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:42.540
and how bad I am at
making each video.

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:45.630
So let me just walk you
through the very first video

00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:46.260
that I made.

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:49.450
So in preparation for
this conversation,

00:09:49.450 --> 00:09:52.600
I went back to some of the
earlier stuff that I had done.

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:54.890
And I'll tell you that
the characters that

00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:59.520
are in these videos started
with the characters that

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:04.930
were-- these are all animated
videos, they're all animations.

00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:08.360
And the characters
who are in them

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:10.340
started with this
comic strip, which

00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:14.160
appeared in the journal,
Nature, in 2005.

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:18.230
So this was the launch
of some of the interest

00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:20.860
around the field of
synthetic biology.

00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:23.490
There were some splashy
papers in Nature,

00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:25.910
as well as this
comic strip, and it

00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:30.730
shows the adventures of a woman
in the lab named System Sally,

00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:34.140
and a boy who's just super
curious named Device Dude,

00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:38.210
and Buddy, who is this little
green blob in the middle there.

00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:41.420
And it's a really fun
comic-- I like comics a lot,

00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:42.540
I grew up with Spider-man.

00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:45.040
I love comic books.

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:48.370
And I like this
one until it gets

00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:50.310
to the really hard content.

00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:53.930
So right at the fold here,
right at the midpoint,

00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:56.880
it starts to talk about
engineered genetic devices.

00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:58.550
And I'll pass this around.

00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:01.190
There's a lot of
content here, Boolean

00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:04.380
logic gates, ribosome
binding sites--

00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:06.210
you have to be an
expert to understand

00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:08.590
what was going on in that comic.

00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:13.300
So my naive thought was, I
would take these characters--

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:16.630
because they were very popular,
people really liked them--

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:19.090
and I would have
dialogue between them

00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:21.610
to explain these ideas,
rather than have them

00:11:21.610 --> 00:11:24.580
on the page with just bubbles
and question marks and things

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:26.390
like that.

00:11:26.390 --> 00:11:30.470
So in a very lucky
way, It turns out

00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:33.200
that my college
roommate's husband

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:34.510
runs an animation company.

00:11:34.510 --> 00:11:37.650
So that's how I got connected
with animated storyboards.

00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:39.530
They gave me a
very nice discount

00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:45.570
on what they would do in
terms of these animations--

00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:46.800
it was still expensive.

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:51.060
But this was the
transition that was made.

00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:53.226
So the comic book turned
into this website,

00:11:53.226 --> 00:11:54.100
which was BioBuilder.

00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:56.850
This was the very first
iteration of the website.

00:11:56.850 --> 00:12:01.420
And it had, on the
left hand panel,

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:04.010
the idea was there would be
science animations, engineering

00:12:04.010 --> 00:12:07.020
animations, technology
animations, things like that.

00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:10.230
And like BrainPOP site,
you would enter that,

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:12.650
and there would be a whole
library of animations

00:12:12.650 --> 00:12:15.150
that you could explore.

00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:17.180
In the end, I don't
have enough years

00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:20.290
to live to populate the site.

00:12:20.290 --> 00:12:22.540
It takes so long to make
each of these animations--

00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:24.830
it would take me forever
to really populate

00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:28.260
the site for visitors to
self-navigate through the topic

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:29.640
areas.

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:31.740
So this was the original idea.

00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:34.320
Then I started working
with a teacher,

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:37.430
and the website
changed to look more

00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:41.200
like this-- where
the animations were

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:44.900
put into a formal
context of activities,

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:47.057
there was also a link
where you could go directly

00:12:47.057 --> 00:12:49.640
to the animations, if you just
wanted to watch the animations.

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:52.460
So this was sort of the
transition period, where there

00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:55.280
was both a library of
animations and activities

00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:59.100
that you could do, if you wanted
to teach with these animations.

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:02.210
There were also single-page
comic strips-- so

00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:05.450
returning to what was originally
the unsuccessful version--

00:13:05.450 --> 00:13:08.500
single-page comic strips that
set up each of the laboratory

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:10.040
activities.

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:12.560
And this was the
transition to, then,

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:14.600
the third version of
the website, which

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:16.650
I showed you at the beginning.

00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:19.950
So let me show you, since
you're working on animations

00:13:19.950 --> 00:13:23.500
of your own, let me show
you some of the detail, some

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:28.680
of the things that went into
building that very first--

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:31.890
well, let me show you the
first animation I did.

00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:32.540
How about that?

00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:34.456
I'll show you what these
animations look like,

00:13:34.456 --> 00:13:37.250
and then I'll show you some
of the fun and the choices

00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:39.630
that went into making this
animation in particular.

00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:41.372
Does that sound like
a reasonable plan?

00:13:41.372 --> 00:13:43.872
AUDIENCE: This would be a great
review, because on Thursday,

00:13:43.872 --> 00:13:45.273
Josh from [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:50.680
NATALIE KULDELL: Great, great.

00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:51.680
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:53.180
[BUBBLES]

00:13:59.890 --> 00:14:02.050
-Dude , no running
in the laboratory.

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:05.110
-Sorry, Sally-- but have you
heard about this competition?

00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:07.970
It's called iGem, and I think my
bacterial bubble could totally

00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:09.190
win this year.

00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:11.570
-I thought you were done
with bacterial bubbles.

00:14:11.570 --> 00:14:13.730
And what do you know about iGem?

00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:15.400
-Um, not much, except
that there's going

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:18.310
to be a bunch of losers and me.

00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:21.070
-I don't think you understand
the nature of this competition.

00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:23.850
iGem-- the International
Genetically Engineered Machine

00:14:23.850 --> 00:14:26.120
Competition is a way
to get young scientists

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:30.010
and engineers working together
to engineer biological systems.

00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:31.086
-Working together?

00:14:31.086 --> 00:14:32.710
Where's the competitive
spirit in that?

00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:37.330
The dude works alone, that way
the dude gets all the credit.

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:39.660
-You need to be a member
of a team to join iGem,

00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:41.330
and you need a
professor to lead it.

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:43.250
-But I heard it was a
student competition.

00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:46.240
-Well, yes, the competition
started in 2004,

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:50.010
based on an undergraduate
class developed at MIT in 2003

00:14:50.010 --> 00:14:51.810
for their short winter session.

00:14:51.810 --> 00:14:54.530
And it continues to be an
undergraduate experience--

00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:56.620
but not without
guidance and support.

00:14:56.620 --> 00:14:58.580
Last year, there were
more than 30 teams

00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:01.000
who competed from
all over the world.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.500
-So that's my competition?

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:04.770
That's a lot of people.

00:15:04.770 --> 00:15:07.430
-A lot of people all
asking the same question--

00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:09.910
can simple biological
systems be built

00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:12.090
from standard
interchangeable parts,

00:15:12.090 --> 00:15:14.470
and operate in living cells?

00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:17.190
Or is biology simply
too complicated

00:15:17.190 --> 00:15:18.780
to be engineered in this way?

00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:19.760
What do you think?

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:22.120
-Biology is not too
complicated for me.

00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:26.830
-The goals of this
competition are

00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:29.540
to enable systematic
engineering of biology,

00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:32.440
promote open and transparent
development of tools

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:34.820
for engineering
biology, and help

00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:37.290
construct a society
that can productively

00:15:37.290 --> 00:15:41.120
apply biological technology.

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:43.760
-OK, I got a lot of
work ahead of me.

00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:45.910
If we're not going to
use my bubble idea,

00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:47.850
what else is possible?

00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:51.230
-Maybe a better question
would be, what isn't possible?

00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:54.360
-OK, so first off, what's
your standard interchangeable

00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:54.860
part be?

00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:56.020
Actually, what parts exist?

00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:57.250
Do we have to make those?

00:15:57.250 --> 00:15:59.010
-You'll probably
need more than one,

00:15:59.010 --> 00:16:01.380
but the registry of
standard biological parts

00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:04.582
is a great resource, with lots
of parts already designed.

00:16:04.582 --> 00:16:06.040
And if we make
parts of our own, we

00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:07.770
should add them to
the registry, in case

00:16:07.770 --> 00:16:09.790
other teams can use them, too.

00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:11.590
-And help other teams?

00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:13.290
What kind of
competition is that?

00:16:13.290 --> 00:16:16.850
Of is that how so many teams got
cool projects going last year?

00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:19.080
Pleasant-smelling bacteria,
a bacteria nightlight,

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:22.000
a DNA drug delivery system--
I heard one team even

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.250
made up bacterial freeze tag.

00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:26.924
To beat those, we should
get started right now.

00:16:26.924 --> 00:16:29.090
-All right, well let's
brainstorm for a little while

00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:30.720
before I have to
get back to work.

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:31.760
How does that sound?

00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:32.790
-Great.

00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:34.520
Can you show me this registry?

00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:37.290
Maybe we can find some
good parts to use.

00:16:37.290 --> 00:16:38.600
-Good idea, Dude.

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:39.870
Let's start there.

00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:41.756
This is where you'll
be able to search.

00:16:41.756 --> 00:16:42.830
-Oh, wow!

00:16:42.830 --> 00:16:44.000
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.020
NATALIE KULDELL: All right,
so that, for better or worse,

00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:52.190
is probably the best video
that's on my website.

00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:57.010
And you know, it was
done several years ago,

00:16:57.010 --> 00:16:58.310
it still holds true.

00:16:58.310 --> 00:17:03.770
So in some ways it-- it still
very accurately describes iGem.

00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:05.901
It has some old screen
shots of the registry

00:17:05.901 --> 00:17:07.359
and things like
that, but you know,

00:17:07.359 --> 00:17:09.220
it was done five
years ago and I think

00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:11.530
it holds up reasonably well.

00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:15.069
It was fun to make, so let me
show you some of the fun things

00:17:15.069 --> 00:17:16.569
that were involved in making it.

00:17:16.569 --> 00:17:18.069
One thing was the script.

00:17:18.069 --> 00:17:22.339
So the script was written by
a former undergrad of mine

00:17:22.339 --> 00:17:26.930
in biological engineering, and
she did a summer UROP with me,

00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:28.850
and wrote some of these scripts.

00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:31.930
And then it was
edited by a woman

00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:34.310
who's on my board who
is also a screenwriter.

00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:37.700
And this just shows you
some of the edits that were

00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:39.872
involved in that short script.

00:17:39.872 --> 00:17:41.080
"Dude, no running in the lab.

00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:42.950
Sorry, Sally, but have you
heard about this competition?

00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:43.660
It's called iGem.

00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:46.410
I think my bacterial bubble
could totally win this year."

00:17:46.410 --> 00:17:49.220
And she deleted, "I
don't much about it,

00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:51.500
but someone gave
me a flyer for it."

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:56.580
So there were a lot of deletions
and edits on the text, itself.

00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:58.230
And if you like
writing, and if you

00:17:58.230 --> 00:18:01.710
like this kind of
sentence level work,

00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:04.020
this is actually pretty
fun and creative.

00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:07.190
I'm not very good at it,
but I think it's fun.

00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:09.490
The other part that
I would say was

00:18:09.490 --> 00:18:15.860
pretty fun was-- oh, before we
did the storyboarding actually,

00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:21.718
we did-- where are
those pictures?

00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:28.110
Maybe it's here.

00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:32.090
Yeah, so the company
that did these animations

00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:36.200
sent me pictures of
people who were posing

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:37.860
in ways that they
thought they would

00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:40.350
be using in this animation.

00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:45.250
And I got to choose
which little boy I wanted

00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:50.320
to be Dude in these comics.

00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:53.560
So I don't remember which one
I chose, but these are all

00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:56.070
shots of actors
that they have who

00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:58.730
come in and pose in ways
that they would think

00:18:58.730 --> 00:19:00.490
might fit the
script, and then you

00:19:00.490 --> 00:19:04.300
get to choose which one they're
going to base the image on.

00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:09.460
I also got to choose voices,
and I have an early read-through

00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:10.446
here that--

00:19:10.446 --> 00:19:11.112
[AUDIO PLAYBACK]

00:19:11.112 --> 00:19:13.470
-My bacteria bubble could
totally win this year.

00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:16.410
-I thought you were done
with bacterial bubbles.

00:19:16.410 --> 00:19:18.760
What do you know about iGem?

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:20.910
-Not much, except that
there's going to be

00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:23.017
a bunch of losers, and me.

00:19:23.017 --> 00:19:23.850
[END AUDIO PLAYBACK]

00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:25.849
NATALIE KULDELL: So that
was a quick read of one

00:19:25.849 --> 00:19:28.290
of the candidates for the
voices and stuff like that.

00:19:28.290 --> 00:19:30.410
So that was kind of
fun to work with them

00:19:30.410 --> 00:19:32.900
to choose actors who
were doing the still

00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:35.350
shots, and the voices,
and things like that.

00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:38.340
And then they did
the storyboarding

00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:43.480
for this animation, which
I had never done before.

00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:46.186
They were very talented at--
they knew where to break it up

00:19:46.186 --> 00:19:47.310
and which shots they'd use.

00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:50.970
And in watching that
video now, and honestly

00:19:50.970 --> 00:19:52.810
I don't watch these
videos regularly,

00:19:52.810 --> 00:19:55.960
so it's interesting to see
a couple things that I think

00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:58.030
still work reasonably well.

00:19:58.030 --> 00:20:02.050
I think it's short enough,
it doesn't go on and on--

00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:04.130
so could be a
little bit shorter,

00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:05.830
but I think it's
pretty interesting.

00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:08.410
I think it zooms in
and out of a reality

00:20:08.410 --> 00:20:09.990
scene and a non-real scene.

00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:12.920
And it covers the
questions they have.

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:15.140
There's a little bit of
lingo and secrecy to it

00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:18.590
that's not as easy
to understand,

00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:20.550
if you don't already
know iGem a little bit.

00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:22.820
But I think it answers
most questions that people

00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:24.810
would have about iGem.

00:20:24.810 --> 00:20:25.310
Yes?

00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:29.666
AUDIENCE: Why did you choose to
do animations rather than film

00:20:29.666 --> 00:20:32.580
a real woman with a boy?

00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:38.450
NATALIE KULDELL: I
think I was misinformed,

00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:40.890
that I thought animations
would be quicker and easier.

00:20:40.890 --> 00:20:43.350
And then I also had
that BrainPOP idea

00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:47.310
in mind, and this
comic strip in mind,

00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:51.190
which had Buddy, this
sort of bacteria thing,

00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:52.980
as one of the characters.

00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:57.040
And so I didn't think a puppet
or something would make sense.

00:20:57.040 --> 00:21:01.120
But that does lead me to
a mistake that I made.

00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:03.720
And again, if I knew
then what I know now--

00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:05.930
who's my audience for this?

00:21:05.930 --> 00:21:09.260
I mean, would high school
students watch this?

00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:10.340
I don't think so.

00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:15.780
I think it's too young for high
school students, and too old

00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:17.590
for middle school students.

00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:21.800
It kind of doesn't
have-- frankly, I

00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:25.440
show it to my undergrads, so
I was like, I'm OK with that.

00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:27.080
So maybe it's OK
for MIT undergrads,

00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:31.190
but then it doesn't really
have a great audience mark.

00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:34.240
And the high school teachers
who are now using them,

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:35.057
it's pretty rare.

00:21:35.057 --> 00:21:36.640
I mean, they may
assign them to people

00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:38.280
to watch the night
before they come in

00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:40.290
and start the discussion
on synthetic biology,

00:21:40.290 --> 00:21:42.400
or start their iGem team,
but it's not something

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:44.590
they show in the classroom.

00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:45.590
Yeah?

00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:48.590
AUDIENCE: So what was the
intent behind making it?

00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:53.280
Because we talk a lot about what
is going to be your what, why,

00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:57.144
and how questions
before you make a video.

00:21:57.144 --> 00:21:59.076
Was it to make
something that was

00:21:59.076 --> 00:22:01.249
instructional for people
who were already interested

00:22:01.249 --> 00:22:03.412
in iGem?

00:22:03.412 --> 00:22:04.787
And if so, what
you made you want

00:22:04.787 --> 00:22:08.910
to do a video over a
comic book, for instance?

00:22:08.910 --> 00:22:13.700
What was that initial interest?

00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:18.270
NATALIE KULDELL: I thought-- why
are there all the words listed

00:22:18.270 --> 00:22:20.040
in the dictionary?

00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:22.940
My goal was to actually
make like a Wikipedia

00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:26.180
of synthetic biology,
covering the relevant topics

00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:27.440
through animation.

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:30.260
So I wasn't being selective--
I had to choose something

00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:31.440
to start with.

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:34.820
iGem was my first, because
it seemed to really capture

00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:37.950
some of the unique features
of synthetic biology,

00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:42.040
and was explainable in a way.

00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:44.860
It's a discrete entity, not
too technical or anything

00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:48.500
like that, that I could cover.

00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:53.250
But it was really intended to
be encyclopedic, not targeted

00:22:53.250 --> 00:22:55.780
to an area that I
wanted to cover--

00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:58.140
except synthetic biology.

00:22:58.140 --> 00:23:00.470
When I started this
project, people

00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:02.720
were coming to me for
learning materials

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:04.860
about synthetic biology,
and some of those people

00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:08.670
were people in government
and policy, some of them

00:23:08.670 --> 00:23:11.950
were biologists wanting to learn
engineering, and some of them

00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:14.530
were engineers wanting
to learn biology.

00:23:14.530 --> 00:23:16.960
And I was not going
to make a comment

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:21.760
book, or a different way for
each of those populations

00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:22.670
to learn.

00:23:22.670 --> 00:23:26.760
I guess my thinking was
that through self-navigation

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:28.640
through animations,
people could learn

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:30.390
what they wanted to learn.

00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:34.880
But what it requires is
a really rich library

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:36.780
of animations to look through.

00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:40.220
And this took me a
full summer to do,

00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:42.900
and I just don't
have that much time.

00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:45.220
I mean, I would need
hundreds of animations,

00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:49.080
and I just didn't have time.

00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:52.360
Then, to top it off, when the
teacher finally came to me

00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:54.750
and said, I can't
teach this way.

00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:57.230
There's no narrative
to using these.

00:23:57.230 --> 00:23:59.150
I need a hook, I
need a something

00:23:59.150 --> 00:24:02.260
that introduce to my students.

00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:05.240
It has to fit into a framework.

00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:07.590
That's when starting
with the research

00:24:07.590 --> 00:24:10.940
questions in the field,
and using these animations

00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:14.110
to support the
background that you

00:24:14.110 --> 00:24:16.500
learn to do the
investigation, just seemed

00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:19.320
to make a lot more sense.

00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:24.260
So if we look back
to the website,

00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:28.410
and we go to the
student side, we

00:24:28.410 --> 00:24:31.780
can look at this one--
what a colorful world.

00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:35.650
So now the bacterial growth
curves animation is here.

00:24:35.650 --> 00:24:38.650
I did, I will say,
introduce another character,

00:24:38.650 --> 00:24:41.359
Izzie the iGemmer--
she's Latina,

00:24:41.359 --> 00:24:43.400
somebody said you should
have a little diversity.

00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:49.300
Anyway, again, it has all kinds
of probably rookie mistakes

00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:51.590
that you guys will never
make, thanks to your course

00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:53.140
that you're taking now at IAP.

00:24:53.140 --> 00:24:56.860
But this is the idea, is that
now these animations don't

00:24:56.860 --> 00:24:59.830
stand on their own the
way like BrainPOP does,

00:24:59.830 --> 00:25:02.010
and you sort of
meander through them.

00:25:02.010 --> 00:25:05.410
Now they're part of
the background material

00:25:05.410 --> 00:25:07.720
you can look at and
read and understand,

00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:12.310
in order to do some
biodesign, or some experiments

00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:15.935
about transformation of
bacteria to different colors,

00:25:15.935 --> 00:25:16.810
and things like that.

00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:22.950
Were there are other--
tell me what would

00:25:22.950 --> 00:25:24.962
be relevant for your work here.

00:25:24.962 --> 00:25:26.920
-OK, I was thinking that
since you work so well

00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:30.625
with the high school
population, if you could orient

00:25:30.625 --> 00:25:33.930
these guys a little bit, since
you work so well with teachers

00:25:33.930 --> 00:25:37.980
and the students,
understanding that age range.

00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:39.905
Right before you
work with them, which

00:25:39.905 --> 00:25:43.440
is our target audience, what
are some science concepts

00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:48.050
that those kids-- like
what do they know?

00:25:48.050 --> 00:25:50.200
It wasn't that long ago
that you were that age,

00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:51.660
but you've done
a lot since then.

00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:53.090
You probably forget.

00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:55.050
Meeting with the sixth
graders would probably

00:25:55.050 --> 00:25:57.466
be very informative to think
about, oh, what do they know,

00:25:57.466 --> 00:25:58.591
what don't they know?

00:25:58.591 --> 00:26:00.840
But maybe it would be helpful,
since you have a better

00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:03.850
understanding of
what's taught when,

00:26:03.850 --> 00:26:05.870
for them to have
a sense of-- say

00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:09.085
sixth grade is
kind of our target,

00:26:09.085 --> 00:26:10.995
what do those kids know,
and what don't they

00:26:10.995 --> 00:26:12.870
know about science?

00:26:12.870 --> 00:26:15.670
AUDIENCE: Sorry, if I
can add one more thing,

00:26:15.670 --> 00:26:17.688
it's really important
because even if-- I mean,

00:26:17.688 --> 00:26:20.556
I had you guys meet with
the sixth graders today,

00:26:20.556 --> 00:26:24.380
but that doesn't mean that
your videos should be talking

00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:25.560
to a ten-year-old, right?

00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:28.410
Because that's really
the basic knowledge

00:26:28.410 --> 00:26:32.480
base of the average
public view, that they're

00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:34.855
not really going to
remember the science

00:26:34.855 --> 00:26:39.260
that they learned beyond
middle school or high school.

00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:42.720
So don't mistake understanding
an audience of sixth graders

00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:46.080
as thinking that it's an
audience of ten-year-olds,

00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:48.010
that you're talking to
them like they're 10.

00:26:48.010 --> 00:26:50.168
Because the person who
watches Myth Busters,

00:26:50.168 --> 00:26:53.120
and the person who goes to
vote on certain policies,

00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:55.088
they're going to share
a knowledge base.

00:26:55.088 --> 00:26:56.564
So that's why I think it's
important to orient yourself

00:26:56.564 --> 00:26:57.548
to that audience.

00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:06.640
NATALIE KULDELL: So in terms of
what folks know and don't know,

00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:10.770
where this content
currently is positioned

00:27:10.770 --> 00:27:14.150
is to fit into the
formal frameworks

00:27:14.150 --> 00:27:17.130
that most high schools
teach for biology.

00:27:17.130 --> 00:27:19.860
In particular, the advanced
placement biology classes.

00:27:19.860 --> 00:27:23.340
And the reason for that is that,
because their laboratory based,

00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:26.470
you really kind of need
particular equipment,

00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:30.410
you need time in your day
to do this kind of stuff

00:27:30.410 --> 00:27:35.480
with them-- if it's a
hands-on lab activity--

00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:38.910
and so the advanced placement
curriculum has that built in,

00:27:38.910 --> 00:27:41.580
and you can make some
presumptions about what's

00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:46.080
available, and what isn't,
what sorts of basic knowledge

00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:46.580
they have.

00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:49.980
At the high school level,
generally speaking,

00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:52.340
there's good abstract thinking.

00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:58.330
You can think about things that
you can't see and understand

00:27:58.330 --> 00:28:02.290
what's going on with them,
without actually having

00:28:02.290 --> 00:28:06.830
to either manipulate them
directly, or visualize

00:28:06.830 --> 00:28:10.490
them, have them right
in front of you.

00:28:10.490 --> 00:28:13.510
At the middle school level, I
don't know that that's true.

00:28:13.510 --> 00:28:16.290
And I will say there is a
BioBuilder junior site that's

00:28:16.290 --> 00:28:21.357
quite fledgling, and
not as robust as this,

00:28:21.357 --> 00:28:22.940
but that there's
great interest in it.

00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:24.530
I mean, you can see the in
sixth-- they're awesome,

00:28:24.530 --> 00:28:25.780
these middle schoolers.

00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:28.220
They're so curious, and they
really want to do stuff,

00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:30.720
and they're not, oh,
I don't like science,

00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:32.160
and oh, I never got that.

00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:35.240
Or they're not already
turned off in some ways,

00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:37.340
they're very open to new ideas.

00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:39.750
What's hard, I think, is
the abstract thinking.

00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:43.810
So when I tell, in
this lab in particular,

00:28:43.810 --> 00:28:48.430
that's here, which is
an experiment which

00:28:48.430 --> 00:28:51.730
brings DNA into a cell and
turns the cell different colors.

00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:54.770
And the scientific
question here is, does it

00:28:54.770 --> 00:28:56.460
matter what cell
type you're using

00:28:56.460 --> 00:28:58.632
to get different levels
of color expression?

00:28:58.632 --> 00:29:00.090
So like the chassis
in which you're

00:29:00.090 --> 00:29:04.339
running this genetic program,
what's the impact of that?

00:29:04.339 --> 00:29:06.130
It's a very important
question in the field

00:29:06.130 --> 00:29:07.630
of biological
engineering-- what cell

00:29:07.630 --> 00:29:09.588
are you going to choose
to run your program in,

00:29:09.588 --> 00:29:10.680
and how do you choose it?

00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:12.860
This is a typical
transformation experiment

00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:14.630
that many schools do
with their students,

00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:18.282
but usually schools are doing
it just as a demonstration.

00:29:18.282 --> 00:29:20.240
What are you going to do
with a middle schooler

00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:24.130
when you say to them, well,
when you add salt to the cell,

00:29:24.130 --> 00:29:27.410
the membrane gets porous,
there are tiny holes in it,

00:29:27.410 --> 00:29:29.940
and the DNA can sneak through?

00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:32.910
They have to buy it.

00:29:32.910 --> 00:29:36.930
So some of the middle school
teachers are doing acting out--

00:29:36.930 --> 00:29:38.780
they have students
stand in a circle

00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:41.240
and hold hands, and say,
OK, now salt's added,

00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:42.670
and have some of
the kids let go.

00:29:42.670 --> 00:29:45.590
And so I think
working with teachers

00:29:45.590 --> 00:29:49.060
who know their audience has
been, for me, critically

00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:53.110
important in making this any
kind of success that it is.

00:29:53.110 --> 00:29:55.180
And I continue to really
value their advice.

00:29:55.180 --> 00:29:57.870
They know what works with their
students and what doesn't.

00:29:57.870 --> 00:30:01.030
And these animations,
some of them use them,

00:30:01.030 --> 00:30:04.560
but I think they mostly use
them as homeworks, not as ways

00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:08.670
to have students discover
what they want to know

00:30:08.670 --> 00:30:09.982
about synthetic biology.

00:30:09.982 --> 00:30:12.440
AUDIENCE: That's going to be
really important, because some

00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:15.780
of you guys have
authentically more

00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:17.660
concrete topics than others.

00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:21.347
Because ships are
something that you can see.

00:30:21.347 --> 00:30:23.775
Computer programming is not.

00:30:23.775 --> 00:30:26.450
So you guys, some of you will
have more abstract concepts,

00:30:26.450 --> 00:30:30.364
are going to have to really
work hard to figure out,

00:30:30.364 --> 00:30:33.520
how do you make that
concrete enough so

00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:39.237
that a kid, who developmentally
can't grasp an abstract concept

00:30:39.237 --> 00:30:42.725
as easily as someone a
bit older-- how do you

00:30:42.725 --> 00:30:46.010
make that with
metaphor, with acting,

00:30:46.010 --> 00:30:47.740
with all these different things?

00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:50.760
How do you use your
communication tools

00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:52.730
to make something
that is maybe a reach

00:30:52.730 --> 00:30:55.360
outside of their developmental
conceptual ability,

00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:57.700
but is still accessible to them.

00:30:57.700 --> 00:31:00.450
AUDIENCE: And I will say
it's that, as a case study

00:31:00.450 --> 00:31:01.700
it's very interesting.

00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:04.504
So when the MIT K12
Videos program started,

00:31:04.504 --> 00:31:06.332
it was originally
allowing students

00:31:06.332 --> 00:31:10.250
to create full videos on
their own without production.

00:31:10.250 --> 00:31:12.056
And I'll have to show
you this slide, maybe

00:31:12.056 --> 00:31:14.610
after Natalie's
talk, but when you

00:31:14.610 --> 00:31:17.530
let MIT students decide
what they want to make,

00:31:17.530 --> 00:31:21.082
just let them do it free-reign,
almost 70% of the videos

00:31:21.082 --> 00:31:22.510
were physics.

00:31:22.510 --> 00:31:25.480
It was alarming, the
overwhelming majority.

00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:28.451
And it's because physics is
a very visual, very tangible

00:31:28.451 --> 00:31:28.950
topic.

00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:32.600
And when you go online, a lot
of science videos and a few

00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:33.350
are physics-based.

00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:36.822
Maybe one was on
electrical engineering.

00:31:36.822 --> 00:31:39.780
And the electrical engineering
ones were about circuits,

00:31:39.780 --> 00:31:41.259
so again, you could
see the parts.

00:31:41.259 --> 00:31:43.231
When we started
producing Science

00:31:43.231 --> 00:31:48.820
out Loud, the one video that
went as popular-- in order

00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:53.070
of magnitude, at least-- and
the view count [INAUDIBLE],

00:31:53.070 --> 00:31:54.320
that's a different discussion.

00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:55.986
But the one that did
the best on its own

00:31:55.986 --> 00:31:57.955
was the one that I
marketed the least.

00:31:57.955 --> 00:32:00.440
I literally just
posted it to YouTube,

00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:02.925
and sent one Tweet about it.

00:32:02.925 --> 00:32:05.232
And it was one on
how computers work.

00:32:05.232 --> 00:32:07.398
And I don't know if you've
been in the Stata Center,

00:32:07.398 --> 00:32:09.910
but there's this machine
called the [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:09.910 --> 00:32:13.920
which explains how
switches count in binary,

00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:17.420
as the fundamental
component of the computer.

00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:20.400
And people loved
that video, and it

00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:23.872
showed this desire
and this innate need

00:32:23.872 --> 00:32:29.034
for a way to visualize these
super abstract concepts.

00:32:29.034 --> 00:32:31.992
And the fact that things
that fulfill that need just

00:32:31.992 --> 00:32:33.690
don't exist right now.

00:32:33.690 --> 00:32:37.224
It's very hard to find a
good video on programming.

00:32:37.224 --> 00:32:40.340
It's very hard to find a good
video on biology, actually.

00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:43.973
Anything microscopic-- it's
hard to create something that's

00:32:43.973 --> 00:32:47.192
visually engaging, to
where you really justify

00:32:47.192 --> 00:32:49.612
making a video out of it.

00:32:49.612 --> 00:32:52.572
If you ask yourself,
why would I make a video

00:32:52.572 --> 00:32:56.307
about microbiology, when it's
so much more clear and so

00:32:56.307 --> 00:33:00.540
much more engaging to
write a blog post about it?

00:33:00.540 --> 00:33:03.606
And so are the challenges
that come along with it.

00:33:03.606 --> 00:33:05.022
And these are very
good questions.

00:33:05.022 --> 00:33:06.438
They're very good
mindsets to have

00:33:06.438 --> 00:33:09.010
when you approach those ideas.

00:33:09.010 --> 00:33:11.140
AUDIENCE: And Elizabeth
had a really--

00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:13.914
we had a really interesting
conversation with those girls

00:33:13.914 --> 00:33:16.080
about what computer programming
concept was actually

00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:18.290
most interesting to them.

00:33:18.290 --> 00:33:20.846
What we realized was
that all of these ideas

00:33:20.846 --> 00:33:23.194
were really big ideas.

00:33:23.194 --> 00:33:25.480
The binary is such
a narrow topic,

00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:27.664
that is allows you to flesh
it out in great detail

00:33:27.664 --> 00:33:30.211
to show-- for the
different types of learners

00:33:30.211 --> 00:33:31.760
who are out there--
different ways

00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:33.980
to access that information.

00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:36.896
So the challenge is
to pick a topic that's

00:33:36.896 --> 00:33:38.850
narrow enough, that
in five minutes,

00:33:38.850 --> 00:33:43.462
you can really unpack it
and pack it back up again.

00:33:43.462 --> 00:33:47.495
And really targeting our
audience to figure out what do

00:33:47.495 --> 00:33:48.995
they know, and what
don't they know,

00:33:48.995 --> 00:33:51.914
so that we're hitting that sweet
spot where it's interesting,

00:33:51.914 --> 00:33:55.566
complicated, but not
so complicated that I

00:33:55.566 --> 00:33:58.510
can't-- it's too much for me.

00:33:58.510 --> 00:34:02.010
AUDIENCE: Jaime's original pitch
was almost six minutes long.

00:34:02.010 --> 00:34:05.630
And it was about how
does a computer work?

00:34:05.630 --> 00:34:07.130
That was his original idea.

00:34:07.130 --> 00:34:07.630
And so it hit upon switches.

00:34:07.630 --> 00:34:09.974
It hit upon talking about
binary and on semi-conductors

00:34:09.974 --> 00:34:12.460
and all these things.

00:34:12.460 --> 00:34:14.540
The switches part
is literally less

00:34:14.540 --> 00:34:17.360
than a sentence of
his pitch, and that

00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:20.312
is what we ended up
exploring for five minutes.

00:34:20.312 --> 00:34:23.216
We had so much to say about it.

00:34:23.216 --> 00:34:26.670
I do think the more
focused a video is,

00:34:26.670 --> 00:34:28.670
it can be a lot more powerful.

00:34:28.670 --> 00:34:30.920
Somehow it makes it more dense.

00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:34.120
Having worked with
this age group myself,

00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:38.070
I remember sixth grades
learning basic biology--

00:34:38.070 --> 00:34:40.276
just so you guys can
orient yourselves.

00:34:40.276 --> 00:34:42.526
Seventh grade is learning
basic structures, typically,

00:34:42.526 --> 00:34:45.412
like how to build a
bridge, and how to keep

00:34:45.412 --> 00:34:47.969
something physically standing.

00:34:47.969 --> 00:34:51.260
Fifth grade is-- I'm
trying to think backwards.

00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:54.440
Eighth is-- chemistry.

00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:57.180
So just so that you guys
have a sense of where

00:34:57.180 --> 00:35:00.750
they are in their
learning, they're

00:35:00.750 --> 00:35:02.342
really sticking
with physical things

00:35:02.342 --> 00:35:03.800
until they get a
little bit bigger,

00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:05.650
and can conceptualize chemistry.

00:35:05.650 --> 00:35:07.650
They're not even ready,
yet, to think about that

00:35:07.650 --> 00:35:09.510
until about eighth
grade-- is like 14.

00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:17.760
NATALIE KULDELL: So maybe in
the last just minute or so,

00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:21.220
I'll show you another
video that's not very good.

00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:23.710
But that does really
speak to this question

00:35:23.710 --> 00:35:29.230
of how I'm trying to visualize
something that is microscopic,

00:35:29.230 --> 00:35:33.850
and what we did with animation
to try to accomplish that.

00:35:33.850 --> 00:35:36.340
And we won't look
at all of this.

00:35:36.340 --> 00:35:38.076
But we'll get to the
microscopic part.

00:35:38.076 --> 00:35:39.525
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:45.470
-Dude, I like what
you built there.

00:35:45.470 --> 00:35:47.680
What's it do?

00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:48.860
-Oh, hi, Iz.

00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:52.270
This is a cool bug-- I made
it using in an electronics

00:35:52.270 --> 00:35:54.370
building kit that Sally got me.

00:35:54.370 --> 00:35:56.300
She wanted to get
me a genetics kit,

00:35:56.300 --> 00:35:57.770
but nothing's available yet.

00:35:57.770 --> 00:35:59.750
Eesh-- I don't get it.

00:35:59.750 --> 00:36:01.680
Why is it so easy
to turn on and off

00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:04.780
the lights for this electronic
bug, but so hard to turn things

00:36:04.780 --> 00:36:06.640
on and off in biology?

00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:08.160
-What do you mean, Dude?

00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:10.650
The arsenic sensor that
we built in bacteria

00:36:10.650 --> 00:36:12.730
a few years ago
works pretty well.

00:36:12.730 --> 00:36:15.430
If there's arsenic in
the water being tested,

00:36:15.430 --> 00:36:17.160
the sensor turns on.

00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:20.310
And when arsenic isn't in
the water, the sensor is off.

00:36:20.310 --> 00:36:23.590
And we built that sensor with
natural biological parts.

00:36:23.590 --> 00:36:25.850
-So arsenic works
like this switch?

00:36:25.850 --> 00:36:27.440
How is that possible?

00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:29.280
How does the cell know?

00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:31.420
-We used parts from
the ArsR operon

00:36:31.420 --> 00:36:34.020
to program arsenic
inducible expression.

00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:37.760
-Hold up, arsenic
inducible expression?

00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:39.140
What's that mean?

00:36:39.140 --> 00:36:42.280
All I know is that
arsenic is toxic.

00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:45.160
Don't the cells just die
when you poison them?

00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:47.390
-Cells have to come up
with a bunch of clever ways

00:36:47.390 --> 00:36:48.520
to survive.

00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:50.410
In the case of
arsenic, the cells

00:36:50.410 --> 00:36:52.060
make a pump to
get the poison out

00:36:52.060 --> 00:36:54.420
as soon as any comes
inside the cell.

00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:57.310
-So asser is the pump.

00:36:57.310 --> 00:36:59.250
-Dude, be careful
how you say it.

00:36:59.250 --> 00:37:01.860
The protein is called
ArsR, since it's

00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:04.140
the arsenic repressor protein.

00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:07.340
And ArsR isn't the pump--
it just tells the cell

00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:09.030
when to make the pump.

00:37:09.030 --> 00:37:12.110
The operon has a promoter,
which is where the cell's RNA

00:37:12.110 --> 00:37:14.590
polymerase binds.

00:37:14.590 --> 00:37:17.720
And at least three
genes, ArsR gene,

00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:19.690
which encodes the
repressor protein,

00:37:19.690 --> 00:37:22.840
and the ArsB gene
which encodes the pump,

00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:26.120
and the ArsC gene, which
encodes an enzyme that

00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:30.120
reduces arsenic in the cell,
so it can be pumped out.

00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:30.747
-Oh, OK, right.

00:37:30.747 --> 00:37:31.580
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:37:31.580 --> 00:37:32.820
NATALIE KULDELL: OK,
so you get the idea.

00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:34.236
It just goes on
from there, and it

00:37:34.236 --> 00:37:36.440
talks about how you build
an inverter by moving

00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:38.550
the repressor and the
promoter in different spots,

00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:40.000
and manipulate the DNA.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:41.682
But you can see
with this one, you

00:37:41.682 --> 00:37:43.140
know there was some
physical object

00:37:43.140 --> 00:37:45.180
that we were trying to use to
illustrate what a switch does.

00:37:45.180 --> 00:37:47.120
But then when you get
down to that DNA level,

00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:49.870
and you're talking about
proteins binding to DNA,

00:37:49.870 --> 00:37:53.140
and names of open reading frames
and stuff, it's just deadly.

00:37:53.140 --> 00:37:56.550
I mean, I can't even watch
it and I know this stuff.

00:37:56.550 --> 00:38:01.020
So I guess it's a real
challenge-- it's a hard thing

00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:05.220
to think about making tangible,
making evident, things

00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:08.440
that are not.

00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:12.200
But I do think there's a great
power through storytelling,

00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:16.760
through animation, through
video that you have,

00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:19.660
and when it's done well
it's really very, very

00:38:19.660 --> 00:38:22.746
effective, and very memorable,
I think is the big part of it.

00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:26.780
Are there any other
quick questions?

00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:28.876
Yes?

00:38:28.876 --> 00:38:31.850
AUDIENCE: What is the criteria
element of the idea is too big?

00:38:36.162 --> 00:38:41.930
When you're brainstorming,
trying to find out ideas.

00:38:41.930 --> 00:38:45.930
Is there communication of when--
because I think, after today,

00:38:45.930 --> 00:38:48.060
we won't get to see the
sixth graders anymore.

00:38:48.060 --> 00:38:50.940
AUDIENCE: Well, you
have us and each other.

00:38:50.940 --> 00:38:52.940
AUDIENCE: I think
the litmus test

00:38:52.940 --> 00:38:55.993
that I used when producing
Science Out Loud-- I didn't

00:38:55.993 --> 00:38:58.951
mention this yesterday, but it
was probably the first thing

00:38:58.951 --> 00:38:59.937
I should've said.

00:38:59.937 --> 00:39:02.895
Because there are no best
practices established

00:39:02.895 --> 00:39:05.853
in this field, take
everything that we

00:39:05.853 --> 00:39:11.290
present to you in class with a
grain of salt. And [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:11.290 --> 00:39:15.540
So what I've found
with distilling

00:39:15.540 --> 00:39:19.410
a big idea is that when I'm
scripting with a student,

00:39:19.410 --> 00:39:22.930
and we start to go down a
rabbit hole, so we're saying,

00:39:22.930 --> 00:39:24.430
well what is a
computer made out of?

00:39:24.430 --> 00:39:26.430
Well, I have to
talk about a switch.

00:39:26.430 --> 00:39:27.930
Then I have to
talk about binary.

00:39:27.930 --> 00:39:29.280
Then I have to do this.

00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:31.155
And we have somehow
found ourselves

00:39:31.155 --> 00:39:33.446
down a rabbit hole that is
tangential to the core topic

00:39:33.446 --> 00:39:35.030
at hand.

00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:37.466
That's always been
an indication for me

00:39:37.466 --> 00:39:39.800
that the core topic is too big.

00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:42.020
And you examine
the branches that

00:39:42.020 --> 00:39:44.520
are possible from
that core topic,

00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:49.492
and start looking at, well, what
can I do from a branch, itself.

00:39:49.492 --> 00:39:51.476
We can talk about
this more-- because I

00:39:51.476 --> 00:39:52.650
know Natalie has to leave.

00:39:52.650 --> 00:39:54.608
Does anyone have any
final questions for her?

00:39:54.608 --> 00:39:57.497
Her email address
is on the syllabus.

00:39:57.497 --> 00:39:59.080
NATALIE KULDELL: I'd
be happy to talk.

00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:01.080
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I
was curious, I guess

00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:05.256
you worked with the sixth grade,
and many different teachers.

00:40:05.256 --> 00:40:09.780
Are they conflicting advice
that is being given you?

00:40:09.780 --> 00:40:11.230
NATALIE KULDELL:
Yes, but I think

00:40:11.230 --> 00:40:15.970
that's because teachers teach
in many different settings.

00:40:15.970 --> 00:40:19.790
And so what is true in one
setting is false in another.

00:40:19.790 --> 00:40:22.440
There are some schools
that won't show YouTube,

00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:24.060
that have that site blocked.

00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:27.210
There are other teachers that
teach every day with YouTube.

00:40:27.210 --> 00:40:32.210
So it's just every teaching
setting is really--

00:40:32.210 --> 00:40:36.330
there's a wide range of--

00:40:36.330 --> 00:40:39.655
AUDIENCE: Somehow you never
get to make a decision--

00:40:39.655 --> 00:40:41.030
AUDIENCE: Standards
are the same.

00:40:41.030 --> 00:40:43.845
NATALIE KULDELL: Yes, right,
so what they have to reach.

00:40:43.845 --> 00:40:46.219
AUDIENCE: It may be different
where you are, but at least

00:40:46.219 --> 00:40:50.160
here, in public settings,
and in some private settings,

00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:53.714
the teachers have
uniform goals that they

00:40:53.714 --> 00:40:57.200
each have to achieve in each
academic year for each student.

00:40:57.200 --> 00:40:59.480
And it's a national
standard in public schools

00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:04.180
that all sixth graders
must do these big topics.

00:41:04.180 --> 00:41:06.330
And so within that,
how to teach those,

00:41:06.330 --> 00:41:07.780
that's the common
thread in that.

00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:08.946
NATALIE KULDELL: Yes, right.

00:41:08.946 --> 00:41:11.420
But in terms of using
animation-- so the question

00:41:11.420 --> 00:41:14.840
I thought was more related
to the tone of the video

00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:18.180
that you're making,
and that is hard,

00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:20.382
because teachers have
very different students,

00:41:20.382 --> 00:41:22.840
and teachers are very different
people, one from the other.

00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:24.330
Some are very
comfortable teaching

00:41:24.330 --> 00:41:26.730
with animated characters,
some think that it

00:41:26.730 --> 00:41:28.020
undermines their authority.

00:41:28.020 --> 00:41:29.740
And I've heard both.

00:41:29.740 --> 00:41:33.570
So it really-- for
better or worse,

00:41:33.570 --> 00:41:35.829
I tend to just make a
decision and go with it.

00:41:35.829 --> 00:41:37.870
This goes back to if I
knew then what I know now.

00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:46.170
I think small, smart steps
is really the only way

00:41:46.170 --> 00:41:48.154
to figure this out.

00:41:48.154 --> 00:41:50.070
Anyway, and with that,
I really do have to go.

00:41:50.070 --> 00:41:51.694
And I'm sorry, but
I'd be happy to talk

00:41:51.694 --> 00:41:54.450
with you guys offline, OK?

00:41:54.450 --> 00:41:55.360
Thank you.

00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:56.910
AUDIENCE: Thanks.
