00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.640
In this video, we're going to
talk about the law of demand,

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.740
which is one of the core
ideas of microeconomics.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.560
And lucky for us, it's
a fairly intuitive idea.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:16.640
It just tells us that if we
raise the price of a product,

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.830
that will lower the quantity
demanded for the product.

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:23.720
Quantity demanded will go down.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.670
And you could imagine
the other side of that.

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:30.510
If we lower the
price of a product,

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.900
that will raise the quantity
demanded of that product.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.550
And the law of demand says
this just kind of generally.

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.820
What we'll see in a
few videos from now

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.760
is that there are some
exceptions to this.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.360
But to make this
little concrete,

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.782
let's think about the demand
for a certain product.

00:00:49.782 --> 00:00:51.240
And one thing I
want to clear here,

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.090
and I'm going to go
through great pains

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.400
to not mess this
up, is that when

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.620
we talk about the word demand
in a formal economic sense,

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.185
we're not talking
about a quantity.

00:01:01.185 --> 00:01:02.560
We're actually
going to talk, all

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:07.310
else equal, ceteris
paribus, the relationship

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.070
between price and
quantity demanded.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.750
If we talk about
an actual quantity,

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.980
we should say the
quantity demanded.

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:17.959
So demand versus
quantity demanded.

00:01:17.959 --> 00:01:19.250
These are two different things.

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.824
And if it's a little
confusing to you

00:01:21.824 --> 00:01:23.740
right now, hopefully by
the end of this video,

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.490
the difference between
demand and quantity

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.400
demanded will become
a little bit clearer.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.580
And definitely over the next few
videos, because in this video,

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.450
we're going to focus on how
the quantity demanded changes

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.620
relative to the price.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.380
In future videos,
we'll talk about how

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.070
the entire relationship,
how demand changes

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.210
based on different factors.

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:42.680
But to make things
concrete, let's

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.040
say I'm about to release
my science fiction

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.824
book, Space Whatever.

00:01:48.824 --> 00:01:50.740
I don't know, the book
that I want to release.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.198
So I'm going to
release some ebook.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.330
And we've done
some market study,

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.330
or we just know how the
demand is related to price

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.460
or the price is
related to demand.

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.960
And we're going to show that
in a demand schedule, which

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.750
is really just a table that
just shows how the price-- and,

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.880
actually I just made
my first mistake.

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.040
I just said how price
relates to demand.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.560
I should say how price
relates to quantity demanded

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.400
and how quantity demanded
relates to price.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.760
So demand schedule, it shows
a relationship between price

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.530
and quantity demanded,
all else equal.

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.170
So we're going to have
multiple scenarios here.

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.890
So this column, let
me do my scenarios.

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.410
In this column, let
me put my price.

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.660
In this column, I put
my quantity demanded.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.172
So scenario, let's
call this scenario A.

00:02:54.172 --> 00:02:56.830
I could price my book at $2.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.750
And I'll get a ton of people
downloading it at that price.

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.010
So I will get 60,000
people download my book

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.400
at that price, my ebook.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.880
Scenario B, I could
raise the price by $2.

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.130
So it's now $4.

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.310
And that kills off
a lot of the demand.

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.830
Now the quantity
demanded goes down

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.720
to 40,000 people downloading it.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.760
Then I can go to scenario C,
if I raise it by another $2.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.470
So now I'm at $6.

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:32.030
Now that lowers the
quantity demanded to 30,000.

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:33.530
I'll do a couple more of these.

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.100
Scenario D, I raise another $2.

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.460
So I get to $8 now.

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:43.990
Now the quantity demanded
goes down to 25,000.

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:46.120
And I'll do one more of these.

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.170
Let me see, what color
have I not used yet.

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:49.440
I haven't used yellow yet.

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.240
Scenario E, if I
raise it to $10,

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:59.760
now the quantity demanded,
let's just say, is 23,000.

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:05.190
So this relationship shows the
law of demand right over here.

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.720
And this table that shows
how the quantity demanded

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.700
relates to price
and vice versa, this

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.700
is what we call a
demand schedule.

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.340
Now we can also, based
on this demand schedule,

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:15.839
draw a demand curve.

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:17.880
And really, we're just
going to plot these points

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.320
and draw the curve
the connects them.

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.297
Because these aren't
the only scenarios.

00:04:23.297 --> 00:04:24.630
Anything in between is possible.

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.330
We could charge
$2.01 for the book.

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.326
We could charge for
$4.50 for the book.

00:04:28.326 --> 00:04:30.700
And so that's what the demand
curve captures a little bit

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:32.860
better, because it's a
continuous curve, not just

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.120
five points.

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.930
So let's do that.

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:37.190
Let's graph it.

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.430
And this is one of those
conventions of economics

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:40.760
that I am not a fan of.

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:45.560
Because people often talk
about changing the price,

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.630
and how the quantity
demanded changes from that.

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:51.434
And in traditional-- in most
of math and science, the thing

00:04:51.434 --> 00:04:52.850
that you're changing,
you normally

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:54.690
put on the horizontal axis.

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:58.730
So if I was in charge of
the convention of economics,

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:01.090
I would plot price on
the horizontal axis

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:02.120
right over here.

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.020
But the way it's
done typically is

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.090
that price is done
on the vertical axis.

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.840
And so you're used to seeing it
in kind of a traditional class

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:09.700
environment.

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:10.820
I'll do the same.

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:13.260
So we'll put price
in the vertical axis,

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:21.390
and we'll put quantity demanded
in the horizontal axis.

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:23.820
And our quantity demanded
goes all the up to 60,000.

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:29.650
So let's see, that's
10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60.

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:34.860
So that's 10-- this is in
thousands-- 20, 30, 40-- sorry,

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:38.220
not 45-- 40, 50, and 60.

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:39.310
And this is in thousands.

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:45.030
And then the price goes
up to $10, from $2 to $10.

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:50.630
So let's say this is
2, 4, 6, 8, and 10.

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:57.720
So let's plot the scenarios.

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:02.810
So scenario A, price is $2,
60,000 units are demanded.

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:05.830
That is scenario A
right over there.

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:13.530
Scenario B, when the price is
$4, 40,000 units are demanded.

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:14.710
And that's right over there.

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:16.480
That's scenario B.

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:22.210
Scenario C, $6, 30,000 units.

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:29.680
Right over there, scenario C.
Scenario D, $8, 25,000 units.

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:32.950
$8, 25 is right about there.

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:34.920
That looks like 25,000,
right in between.

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:36.070
That's close enough.

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:39.760
So that right over
there is scenario D.

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:46.590
And then finally scenario
E, $10, 23,000 units.

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:48.915
So it might be
something like that.

00:06:48.915 --> 00:06:50.870
That is scenario E.

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:52.370
And so we could
actually have prices

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:53.411
anywhere in between that.

00:06:53.411 --> 00:06:55.070
And maybe we could
even go further.

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:56.697
So this right over here.

00:06:56.697 --> 00:06:58.280
So if I were to draw
the demand curve,

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:00.570
it could look
something like this.

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:03.330
The demand curve
would look something--

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:04.820
I'm trying to do
my best to draw it

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:08.830
as a straight continuous line--
could look something like that.

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:11.020
And it could keep
going on and on.

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:13.860
And so these are two
ways to show demand.

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:16.120
So just going back to
what I said earlier,

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:17.880
the quantity
demanded is, all else

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:22.220
equal for a given price,
how many units people are

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:25.370
willing to download
or buy of my ebook.

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:30.490
When we talk about
the demand itself,

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:33.010
we're talking about this
entire relationship.

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:36.120
So this demand itself is
this entire demand schedule.

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:39.210
Or another way to think of it
is this entire demand curve.

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:43.790
If demand were to
change, we would actually

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:44.990
have a different curve.

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:48.710
This curve would shift, or
the entries in this table

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:49.620
would shift.

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:51.980
If the quantity of
demand changes--

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:55.000
so we move along this curve when
you hold everything else equal

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.210
and you only change price.

00:07:57.210 --> 00:07:58.760
So hopefully that
makes it clear.

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:02.640
When everything else is equal,
and you're only changing price,

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:04.130
you're not changing
demand, you're

00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:05.630
changing the quantity demanded.

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:07.970
The demand, because
everything else is equal,

00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:09.462
is this relationship.

00:08:09.462 --> 00:08:10.920
In the next few
videos, we'll think

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:12.630
about what does
happen when you do

00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:15.630
change some of
those other factors.
