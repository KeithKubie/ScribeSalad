came up with a program for treating
 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.480
came up with a program for treating
drug-resistant tuberculosis in some of

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:28.490
drug-resistant tuberculosis in some of
 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.640

the world's most conflict-ridden poorest
 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.400
the world's most conflict-ridden poorest
places and they succeeded in doing it

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:33.410
places and they succeeded in doing it
 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.290
places and they succeeded in doing it
they had very good treatment outcomes so

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.300
they had very good treatment outcomes so
 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.520
they had very good treatment outcomes so
they thought creatively about how to

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:36.530
they thought creatively about how to
 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:38.350
they thought creatively about how to
come up with treatment programs that

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:38.360
come up with treatment programs that
 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.920
come up with treatment programs that
worked

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:38.930
worked
 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:40.780
worked
and as a result funding for a

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:40.790
and as a result funding for a
 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.460

drug-resistant TB increased

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:42.470
drug-resistant TB increased
 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.100
drug-resistant TB increased
spectacularly and now many people around

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.110
spectacularly and now many people around
 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.950

the world have treatment so what did

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960
the world have treatment so what did
 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.780
the world have treatment so what did
they do I think what they did is they

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:49.790
they do I think what they did is they
 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.299

have this virtue which requires three

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309
have this virtue which requires three
 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:55.870
have this virtue which requires three
things first that we commit to

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:55.880
things first that we commit to
 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.360
things first that we commit to
fulfilling human rights second that we

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370
fulfilling human rights second that we
 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.729
fulfilling human rights second that we
think creatively or imagine ways of

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739
think creatively or imagine ways of
 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:03.160
think creatively or imagine ways of
doing that and finally that we act to do

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170
doing that and finally that we act to do
 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.649
doing that and finally that we act to do
so so let me explain the virtue of

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659
so so let me explain the virtue of
 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:07.450
so so let me explain the virtue of
creative resolve a little bit more and

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460
creative resolve a little bit more and
 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.090
creative resolve a little bit more and
hopefully you'll see why I think it's

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100
hopefully you'll see why I think it's
 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.120
hopefully you'll see why I think it's
really important so first to have the

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130
really important so first to have the
 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.280
really important so first to have the
virtue one has to question evidence

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290
virtue one has to question evidence
 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.440
virtue one has to question evidence
against the possibility of fulfilling

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450
against the possibility of fulfilling
 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.469
against the possibility of fulfilling
Human Rights we can do this in many ways

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479
Human Rights we can do this in many ways
 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:22.230
Human Rights we can do this in many ways
so we can question the source

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240
so we can question the source
 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.460
so we can question the source
reliability or implications of that

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470
reliability or implications of that
 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.410
reliability or implications of that
evidence it's possible to acquiesce too

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420
evidence it's possible to acquiesce too
 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.570
evidence it's possible to acquiesce too
quickly in the face of evidence that

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:31.580
quickly in the face of evidence that
 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.510
quickly in the face of evidence that
it's impossible to help people or to be

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520
it's impossible to help people or to be
 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.280
it's impossible to help people or to be
so pigheaded that we refuse to accept

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290
so pigheaded that we refuse to accept
 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.000
so pigheaded that we refuse to accept
the constraints of the given the second

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.010
the constraints of the given the second
 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:41.710
the constraints of the given the second
thing that we need to do is I think

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720
thing that we need to do is I think
 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.719
thing that we need to do is I think
consider all of the options on the table

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729
consider all of the options on the table
 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:46.600
consider all of the options on the table
and then use our imagination to come up

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610
and then use our imagination to come up
 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:52.450
and then use our imagination to come up
with new options finally we should act

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460
with new options finally we should act
 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.730
with new options finally we should act
to fulfill human rights and this

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740
to fulfill human rights and this
 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.620
to fulfill human rights and this
requires a measure of grit will or

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630
requires a measure of grit will or
 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.980
requires a measure of grit will or
resoluteness we can't be inflexible and

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990
resoluteness we can't be inflexible and
 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:01.840
resoluteness we can't be inflexible and
persists even when it is actually

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850
persists even when it is actually
 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.999
persists even when it is actually
impossible to fulfill rights but at the

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:04.009
impossible to fulfill rights but at the
 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:05.649
impossible to fulfill rights but at the
same time we shouldn't be complacent

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659
same time we shouldn't be complacent
 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:10.300
same time we shouldn't be complacent
about it since change is difficult

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310
about it since change is difficult
 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.309
about it since change is difficult
people who don't think

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319
people who don't think
 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:15.850
people who don't think
it's possible or desirable to fulfill

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860
it's possible or desirable to fulfill
 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.009
it's possible or desirable to fulfill
human rights probably won't try hard to

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:18.019
human rights probably won't try hard to
 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:20.410
human rights probably won't try hard to
do so so hope is important for the

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420
do so so hope is important for the
 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.660
do so so hope is important for the
virtue of creative resolve hope is

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670
virtue of creative resolve hope is
 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.429
virtue of creative resolve hope is
simply believing something that one

00:02:24.429 --> 00:02:24.439
simply believing something that one
 

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:26.850
simply believing something that one
desires is possible but not certain

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860
desires is possible but not certain
 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.100
desires is possible but not certain
still even when we lack a kind of hope I

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110
still even when we lack a kind of hope I
 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.809
still even when we lack a kind of hope I
think we should have the virtue of

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:31.819
think we should have the virtue of
 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:34.030
think we should have the virtue of
creative resolve as long as there is not

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040
creative resolve as long as there is not
 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.860
creative resolve as long as there is not
conclusive evidence that fulfilling

conclusive evidence that fulfilling

conclusive evidence that fulfilling
Human Rights is impossible so the kind

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:38.569
Human Rights is impossible so the kind
 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:42.759
Human Rights is impossible so the kind
of hope we need is a radical hope in the

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769
of hope we need is a radical hope in the
 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:45.099
of hope we need is a radical hope in the
face of uncertainty we we must process

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:45.109
face of uncertainty we we must process
 

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:47.860
face of uncertainty we we must process
it exercise our moral imaginations to

it exercise our moral imaginations to
 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.979
it exercise our moral imaginations to
help people meet their basic needs but

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989
help people meet their basic needs but

the reason we should have creative

the reason we should have creative
 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.720
the reason we should have creative
resolve is this the ground for the human

to live a dignified human life and it's

to live a dignified human life and it's
 

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:02.860
to live a dignified human life and it's
really important that we do that so we

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870
really important that we do that so we
 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:03.789
really important that we do that so we
should try hard

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:03.799
should try hard
 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:07.690
should try hard
I think the imperative to try hard is

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700
I think the imperative to try hard is
 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.670
I think the imperative to try hard is
particularly compelling given that

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680
particularly compelling given that
 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.800
particularly compelling given that
there's a lot of psychological evidence

there's a lot of psychological evidence
 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.020
there's a lot of psychological evidence
that people don't try hard enough they

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030
that people don't try hard enough they
 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.559
that people don't try hard enough they
tend to search - not far enough for

00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:17.569
tend to search - not far enough for
 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:20.349
tend to search - not far enough for
solutions to problems and many people

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:20.359
solutions to problems and many people
 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:21.869
solutions to problems and many people
seem to have a narrow view of
