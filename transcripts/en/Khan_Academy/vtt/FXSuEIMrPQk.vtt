00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.520
 

00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.560
We've all had cuts on our finger
or wherever else on our

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.320
body, and immediately that part
of the body gets a little

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:16.219
bit of redness, a little bit of
swelling, some heat maybe,

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:18.800
and, of course, there'll be
some pain associated with

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.040
what's going on there.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.150
And in general, this set of
symptoms that we experience,

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.370
these are known as the
inflammatory response, or you

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:29.220
might say that there's some
inflammation going on there.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.670
And people have known about this
I guess ever since really

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.230
people have been having cuts.

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.250
I think probably with modern
medicine, people have been a

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.030
little bit more particular about
actually classifying the

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.640
symptoms, but this isn't
anything new for someone to

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.880
say that there's some type of
inflammation going on or some

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.380
type of inflammatory response.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.080
But what I want to do in this
video is understand what's

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.330
causing these-- I guess we can
call them macrosymptoms.

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.130
What's happening at
a cellular level?

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:58.480
Because, really, the
inflammatory response is

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.140
essentially the initial
field of battle

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.530
of our immune system.

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.090
Our first line of defense is our
skin or the fluids on the

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.360
outside of our skin or the
mucous membranes, but the

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.070
inflammatory response is what
happens when something gets

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.780
beyond that.

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.870
We get punctured with a nail, or
there's some type of virus

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:21.000
or bacteria gets beyond our
skin or the mucus that

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.250
surrounds our membranes.

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.950
 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:31.160
This is the field of battle,
especially the

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.830
initial field of battle.

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:37.940
So let's set up an immune battle
so we can see exactly

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.000
what's going on with the
inflammatory response.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.050
And I want to be very clear.

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:47.830
Immunology, is still a very
under understood field.

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:49.400
It's an area of active
research.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.520
People are still discovering
the mechanisms

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.270
and it's hugely complex.

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.520
I'm sure we'll probably
be studying this for a

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:56.550
long time to come.

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.250
So what I'm going to talk about
is just the overview,

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.700
just you know the general actors
and you know in general

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.760
what's causing the redness,
the swelling, the

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.030
heat, and the pain.

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.855
So let me draw some
skin cells.

00:02:05.855 --> 00:02:09.070
 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:10.889
This is a gross
oversimplification of

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:13.820
everything, but it's really just
to give an idea of what

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:14.900
is going on.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.420
So I'm going to do
a cross-section.

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.210
So those are some skin cells in
there, and then I'm going

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:22.190
to-- so this is the outside
world right here.

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.120
 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.770
Then amongst those skin cells,
I'll do some other cells.

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:28.820
We'll talk about what they do.

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.340
I won't go into huge
detail about them.

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.410
Let's call this cell right
here a mast cell.

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.260
I'll draw a few more
mast cells.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.110
Maybe another one right there.

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.500
That's a mast cell.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.500
And if you remember from the
videos on phagocytic action or

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.480
phagocytes, you'll remember
there was one type called

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.710
dendritic cells and they tend
to hang out near our skin.

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.430
They kind of hang out near areas
that might interface

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:55.380
with the outside world.

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.640
I'll draw a couple of dendritic
cells and these are

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.680
also the ones that were
really good at

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.550
activating helper T-cells.

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:11.480
 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:12.370
They're called dendritic
cells.

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.450
They have no relation to
the nervous system.

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.440
They just look like they have
dendrites on them and that's

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.170
why they call them dendritic,
but they're really phagocytes

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:24.800
and they tend to be near
external interfaces and they

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.530
phagocytose particles and
they're good at presenting

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.150
them to helper T-cells so that
they can get activated and

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:31.870
ring the alarm bell,
so to speak.

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.870
So this is just a normal,
functioning, happy skin.

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.290
So that's the outside.

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.170
Over here, this is the
interstitial fluid.

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:43.200
 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.740
That's just a fancy word for the
fluid that cells are kind

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:50.220
of being surrounded by
or that bathe cells.

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.350
The cells aren't all directly
connected to

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:53.530
the circulatory system.

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.190
The oxygen goes from the
circulatory system to the

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.240
interstitial fluid and
eventually finds

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:59.250
its way into cells.

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.380
So everything is directly
connected to capillaries, but

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.560
capillaries play a big role
in our circulatory system.

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:06.470
So let me draw that.

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.815
Instead of just drawing them as
tubes, I'm actually going

00:04:08.815 --> 00:04:11.360
to draw the cells of our
circulatory system.

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.130
So let's say that this down
here-- these are the

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.670
endothelial cells of
our capillaries.

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:21.310
So these are literally the cells
that make up the walls

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:22.560
of our capillaries.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:32.100
 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:33.490
And of course, this is
a cross-section.

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.410
If I were to-- I would draw
it as a tube somehow.

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:37.420
It's not like it's a sandwich.

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:38.940
It's actually a tube.

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.040
Everything is in
cross-section.

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:55.160
So these are capillary
endothelial cells, and of

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.850
course, right in here, we have
our blood flowing and we'll

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:00.460
have red blood cells in here.

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.315
 

00:05:03.315 --> 00:05:04.600
These are red blood cells.

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.050
Maybe they're flowing
in that direction.

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:07.390
On this side, they're
oxygenated.

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:10.250
This would be arteries and then
they'd become veins as

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:13.580
the red blood cells
lose their oxygen.

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.950
And of course, you might have
circulating white blood cells

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:21.470
inside of your-- obviously, in
much lower quantity than your

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:23.580
red blood cells, but just to
show that they're circulating

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:25.940
and they're moving with your
circulatory system being

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:27.640
pumped by the heart.

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.500
Now under normal circumstances,
there is an

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:33.210
exchange obviously of gases
between what's going on in our

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:36.020
circulatory system and the
interstitial fluid and there's

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:40.140
also a mild exchange of some
cells and proteins.

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:41.950
What we're going to see
now is what happens

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:43.090
when we have an intruder.

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:46.430
So let's say someone takes a
nail, dips it in some cow

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:50.170
manure, and then pokes
you with that nail.

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:51.420
Let's see what happens.

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:57.730
 

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:00.100
So let's say someone pokes
you with this nail

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:01.370
dipped in cow manure.

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:07.570
So it's got all sorts of nasty
stuff on it, pathogens on it,

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:09.730
probably has a bunch
of bacteria

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:11.240
sitting in the cow manure.

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.000
I didn't pick cow manure
at random.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.920
It's probably a good
source of bacteria.

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:19.720
So as soon as it pierces the
first line of defense, as soon

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:22.310
as it pierces your skin,
a couple of things

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:22.830
are going to happen.

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:25.740
A lot of these bacteria are
immediately going to start

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:29.860
floating around in your
interstitial fluid.

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:32.310
The cells that it came in
contact with, it pierced them.

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:33.570
It probably killed some cells.

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:36.990
It's also going to damage some
of these skin cells and those

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:38.860
skin cells are immediately
going to start releasing

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:42.120
chemicals, the ones that are
still in a position to do so.

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.530
They're going to start releasing
chemicals that are

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:46.520
essentially chemical messengers
that move through

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:49.360
the-- well, at first locally in
the interstitial fluid and

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:50.970
says, something is going on.

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:52.890
Something has happened to me.

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:54.140
And these are called
chemokines.

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:57.560
 

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:00.960
And chemokines are just a very
general word, really, for

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:05.110
small molecules or small
proteins that cells release as

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:06.570
a kind of signaling mechanism.

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:10.170
Chemo for chemical, kine for
kinetic, for moving.

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:11.560
These are messengers.

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:12.460
They move.

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:14.790
So these chemokines
get released.

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:17.120
And this is all tremendously
complicated.

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:18.840
So I'm doing very high level.

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:20.970
There are many, many types
of chemokines.

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:23.160
And also you have these mast
cells here, and these mast

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:26.570
cells can be activated by direct
contact maybe with the

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:27.440
rusty nail.

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:31.150
It could be from the chemokines
released by some of

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:32.500
these cells up here.

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:35.460
It could be from some of the
molecules released by the

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:36.870
actual bacteria.

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:40.800
These bacteria are also
releasing different byproducts

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:43.350
as they enter the body.

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:48.020
And any of the above can
activate the mast cells and

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:49.440
mast cells release histamine.

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:56.880
 

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:58.910
So you can already appreciate,
I'm doing a high-level

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:01.280
overview, and it already is
kind of complicated, but I

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:02.870
think you get the sense
of what's going on.

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:07.270
And if the word histamine sounds
vaguely familiar, it's

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:11.040
probably because you've taken
an antihistamine sometime

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:12.800
probably in the last
several months,

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:15.240
especially during cold season.

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:18.590
Histamine is kind of one of
the main actors in the

00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:20.840
inflammatory response, and when
you have a cold and a

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:24.760
runny nose and stuffy nose and
all of those type of things,

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:29.950
those are all byproducts of the
inflammatory response, and

00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:32.880
anti-histamines essentially
try to shut down that

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:36.000
inflammatory response so some
of those symptoms disappear.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.490
But it begs the question
of is that necessarily

00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:39.419
always a good thing?

00:08:39.419 --> 00:08:41.539
Because, as I'm going to talk
about in this video, this is

00:08:41.539 --> 00:08:42.880
the first line of defense.

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:46.690
This is the first part of the
battle of our immune system.

00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:49.330
But anyway, so the histamine--
one of the things that the

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:54.460
histamine does is it goes to
the endothelial cells that

00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:58.750
line your capillaries, and it
causes them to separate away

00:08:58.750 --> 00:09:03.400
from each other and make the
actual capillaries larger.

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:04.650
This is called vasodilation.

00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:15.560
 

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:17.960
Let's say that they've all been
activated with a little

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:19.210
bit of histamine.

00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:23.680
 

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:24.910
The histamine has come
in so now these

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:27.110
guys get further apart.

00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:29.130
They get further apart
and the actual

00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:30.400
capillary becomes larger.

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:35.810
 

00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:38.780
So this is where you get a lot
of your swelling, because all

00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:41.370
of sudden, the capillary's
larger, more fluid, and

00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:44.110
actually, it gets smaller
further down so it really

00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:47.780
encourages the fluid to collect
right around here.

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:51.190
So this is called vasodilation,
just another

00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:52.960
fancy word for saying your

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:54.470
capillaries are getting dilated.

00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:55.420
They're getting larger.

00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:57.420
Fluid is filling them up.

00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:00.900
Not only are things starting
to collect here-- more and

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:03.830
more red blood cells are
collecting here, obviously

00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:06.580
there's a lot of fluid here,
the white blood cells-- but

00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:09.400
also the capillary walls are
becoming more porous.

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:11.820
All of a sudden, things that
couldn't get through them are

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:14.280
going to have a much easier
time getting through them.

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.810
And one of those things that
are going to have an easier

00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:18.750
time getting through them-- and
once again, remember, all

00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:20.210
this other stuff is going on.

00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:24.400
You have these histamines that
are being dumped on these

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:26.350
endothelial cells and
maybe some of it 's

00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:27.340
getting into the serum.

00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:31.530
You have these chemokines being
released locally from

00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:32.920
this area of damage.

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:35.550
You have the actual things
being-- the green was the

00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:38.870
color of the molecules being
released by the viruses.

00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:41.330
You have the chemokines,
which are in blue.

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:44.820
They're all being
released here.

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:48.600
And so the first responders,
the phagocytes, and in

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:51.590
particular, the neutrophils,
which are the most abundant of

00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:54.510
the phagocytes, a subclass of
white blood cells, they're

00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:56.730
attracted to these chemicals.

00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:58.760
They want to move in the
direction that there's more of

00:10:58.760 --> 00:10:59.660
these chemicals.

00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:03.800
And now that the space between
these capillary cells have

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:06.440
gotten further apart, they
can get through.

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:08.855
So what they actually do is--
let's say that this right here

00:11:08.855 --> 00:11:10.105
is a neutrophil.

00:11:10.105 --> 00:11:13.980
 

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:17.530
They start kind of rolling along
the wall right here.

00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:19.330
That's called marginalization.

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:23.310
They roll along this wall and
eventually-- so they kind of

00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:24.600
stick to the wall.

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:27.610
They adhere to the wall, and
then eventually they squeeze

00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:32.650
through these gaps in
the capillary wall.

00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:36.220
This is called diapedesis
or extravasation.

00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:38.110
Sometimes it's called
emigration.

00:11:38.110 --> 00:11:39.800
These are all fancy words,
but essentially it's just

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:40.920
squeezing through the walls.

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:42.620
So that's the neutrophil
right there.

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:45.270
And then, of course, because of
the vasodilation, this is

00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:48.120
where the neutrophils will be
getting dumped in and this is

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:49.800
exactly where they're needed.

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:52.090
So these neutrophils are going
to be here and then they're

00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:52.870
going to do what they do.

00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:55.810
They're going to phagocytose
some of these bacteria and

00:11:55.810 --> 00:11:57.330
start eating up, and
maybe even some

00:11:57.330 --> 00:11:59.240
damaged cells up here.

00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:00.460
And so that's what you
want to happen.

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:01.860
That's why I said this is
the field of battle.

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:04.310
At the same time, your dendritic
cells, other

00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:08.430
phagocytes, they will eat up the
viruses and then they'll

00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:10.530
present them on their
surfaces.

00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:12.980
And it's not just neutrophils
that are coming in.

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:17.240
Because this is kind of an area
of congestion and all of

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:21.410
the fluid is coming here, you'll
also have B-cells and

00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:24.180
T-cells that'll also
make their way.

00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:27.840
They'll also experience
marginalization, where they

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:32.130
roll up against the sides of
the capillary and then

00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:35.900
diapedesis or extravasation
where they go through, and

00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:37.670
then they'll be activated, and
they can actually do the

00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:39.490
specific immune system.

00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:41.840
So the whole point here is I
wanted to show you-- and this

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:45.730
is why I delayed the whole
video on the inflammatory

00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:49.440
response, because it isn't just
one type of simple thing.

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:51.830
It's actually the field of
battle where all of the actors

00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:54.400
come and play, even the first
line of defense of your skin,

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:58.480
and then all of the actors, the
nonspecific reactions of--

00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:00.610
inflammatory response is
normally categorized as

00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:02.520
nonspecific because it's going
to happen no matter what

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:05.450
comes, but you have the
nonspecific actors like the

00:13:05.450 --> 00:13:06.320
neutrophils.

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:11.600
You have your specific actors
like your B-cells and T-cells

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:13.890
and you also have the
nonspecific complement system.

00:13:13.890 --> 00:13:15.580
And I'm not going to go into
detail here, but you actually

00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:19.990
have proteins that are flowing
in your blood plasma that are

00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:23.650
normally in an inactive state,
but when the inflammatory

00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:27.050
response occurs, these proteins,
they get essentially

00:13:27.050 --> 00:13:29.940
activated and sometimes-- and
this is all not 100% well

00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:32.490
understood-- they become
activated, they get cleaved

00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:35.600
up, and then the cleaved-up
versions of those proteins are

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:41.070
really good at, in a very
nonspecific way, helping to

00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:43.770
kill off at least some of what's
getting-- maybe the

00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:44.970
bacteria in this case.

00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:46.990
So this right here, this is the
complement system, which

00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:49.600
is really just a set of proteins
that always just

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:53.070
floats around and they are a
good kind of first line of

00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:57.950
nonspecific fight against some
type of invading pathogen.

00:13:57.950 --> 00:14:02.470
So hopefully, this gives you a
good sense of what is going on

00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:04.410
in the inflammatory response.

00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:06.670
And as you can imagine, you have
all of this fluid coming

00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:09.210
here, all of this blood
is collecting here.

00:14:09.210 --> 00:14:13.180
You have all of this fluid
coming into-- so not just

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:16.280
cells that are going from
our capillaries into our

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:18.960
interstitial fluid, you'll
actually have fluid going in

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:20.990
and that fluid that's going
in is called exudate.

00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:23.800
 

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:27.010
So this whole thing become
swelling and red and engorged

00:14:27.010 --> 00:14:30.180
and that's why you see, on kind
of a very macro level,

00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:31.970
these type of symptoms.

00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:34.550
Anyway, hopefully, you
found that useful.
