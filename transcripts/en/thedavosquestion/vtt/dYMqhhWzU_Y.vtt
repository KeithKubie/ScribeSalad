00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.140
&gt;&gt; I think it's going to take a few decades
for India to become a

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:11.720
superpower.
We -- unless we solve the basic problems of

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:17.869
our poverty, the
infrastructure, and plying our own people

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:22.019
to create wealth, it's not
going to be easy.

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:30.130
For decades, we have forced our people to
either not be proud of what

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.680
they are doing or to take their money out
of the country.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.420
It's only in the last one decade of reforms,
or a little more than

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:45.560
that, that the reforms have taken place.
But these are not enough.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:50.780
We have miles and miles to go and I do not
see any kind of seriousness

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:51.780
about that.
If we're really, really want to become a superpower,

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.559
what we have to do
is unshackle our businesses totally.

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:02.429
We have to allow the global best practices
to come in freely.

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:08.220
We have to allow the ingenuity of our own
people to be -- to help us

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.800
create wealth in this country.
The poverty in this country so blinding and

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:20.580
so deep that it will
probably take us at least 2 to 3 decades,

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.901
with strong reforms and when
I say reforms, I don't mean the reforms that

00:01:25.901 --> 00:01:29.680
we are seeing for now, but
much stronger and much better than that for

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.690
India to become a
superpower.

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.370
Superpower does not mean only in sense of
military.

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:40.630
[INAUDIBLE] collapsed because it didn't have
the, they didn't actually

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.910
care for their own people.
It was just a handful of people on the top

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:49.630
who were controlling the
lives and futures of the whole country.

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:55.060
We as a democracy must [INAUDIBLE] in the
sense that we must, we in

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.690
India allowed to economic freedom [INAUDIBLE]
and we must and in an

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:02.030
actual economic freedom, [INAUDIBLE] and for
that, we need to do many

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:14.219
more things in many more ways for India to
be a superpower.
