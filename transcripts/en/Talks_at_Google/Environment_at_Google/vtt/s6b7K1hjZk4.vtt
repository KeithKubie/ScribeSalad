00:00:08.372 --> 00:00:10.330
ALEX EPSTEIN: When I woke
up yesterday morning,

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:13.580
I thought, hey, tomorrow,
I'm speaking at Google.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.820
And this is interesting
to me because it

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.460
made me think, for some reason,
about what is the first time I

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.410
heard about Google.

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:25.010
And back then, what would I
have imagined speaking about?

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:28.360
And it was spring of 2000 and
I was a computer science major

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.160
at the time at Duke University.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.760
And I was in computer
science class,

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.660
and I remember that
the TA just in passing

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.430
mentioned this
thing called Google.

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.970
And of course, at the time,
I was an avid AltaVista user

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.730
because that was obviously the
best search engine, in terms

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.400
of algorithm and scope.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.329
And I said, well,
what is that, Google?

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:49.245
And then I looked it up
and I'm like, oh, wow,

00:00:49.245 --> 00:00:53.170
this is actually-- even
then, it was pretty amazing.

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.440
And at the time, I wanted
to be a tech entrepreneur.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.240
And slightly after
that, I had decided

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.030
I wanted to be a
practical philosopher.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.310
But under no
circumstances would I

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:07.765
have ever thought that 17
years later, I would be this.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.430
So this is the
People's Climate March.

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.950
This took place several
years ago, actually.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.070
And it was the largest
protest against fossil fuels,

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.780
I think, in human history.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.580
And 100,000 people
were protesting

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.520
against fossil fuels,
and I disagree with them

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.460
very strongly, as
you might tell here.

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.490
And so I flew over
to the east coast

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.010
from Orange County, California
where I lived at the time,

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.140
and I stayed up until 4:00 a.m.

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.090
figuring out how to
print this giant sign,

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.770
and I already own the cache of
I love fossil fuels t-shirts,

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.680
so I was very passionate
about it already.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.260
And I went and I stood out
in the middle of Sixth Avenue

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.180
while tens of thousands
of people walked by.

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.050
But you can see this on a--
it's on a site called YouTube,

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.900
actually.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:00.588
You can find if you search Alex
Epstein People's Climate March.

00:02:00.588 --> 00:02:03.140
So this is the last
thing that I expected.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.540
Many other things that I've done
are the last thing I expected.

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.282
In 2012, there's a guy
named Bill McKibben, who's

00:02:10.282 --> 00:02:12.240
considered the world's
leading environmentalist

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.850
by many people, and
he wrote an article

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.130
saying that the fossil fuel
industry was public enemy

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:18.200
number one.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.960
And the fossil fuel industry
said nothing in response.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.870
And I really like the
fossil fuel industry,

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.828
even though I wasn't in
it and didn't even know

00:02:26.828 --> 00:02:28.240
anyone in it, at the time.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.855
So I decided as actually a
very poor person of the time,

00:02:31.855 --> 00:02:33.480
that I would get this
guy to debate me,

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.190
because I was really upset.

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.780
And so I offered him
$10,000 and he accepted.

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.600
So he debated and it got covered
on the "New York Times" web

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:43.500
site.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.760
Or I didn't really ever think
I'd make a "Rolling Stone" top

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.990
10 list, but a couple of years
ago I made the denier elite,

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:53.730
so I was there with
the Koch brothers

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.830
and assorted Republicans.

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.880
And as you'll, see I disavow
this label of denier.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.120
But I had no
expectation whatsoever

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.730
of becoming even really
pro-fossil fuels,

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.750
but let alone a passion
that has consumed,

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.326
so far, 10 years of my life.

00:03:12.326 --> 00:03:13.700
I didn't really--
I wasn't really

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.158
that interested in
energy, but if I

00:03:15.158 --> 00:03:17.820
was, the two forms of energy
that I found interesting

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.890
were nuclear and solar.

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.750
Those seemed to be the future.

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.420
But the idea of getting
excited about energy

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.230
from three centuries
ago, coal or oil or gas.

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:28.956
I mean, come on.

00:03:28.956 --> 00:03:30.330
There's nothing
great about that.

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.230
I mean, maybe you tolerate them.

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.490
But why would you get
excited about them?

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:39.640
So what changed?

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.790
Two realizations.

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.940
One is that cheap,
plentiful, reliable energy

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.630
is far more important to human
flourishing than I thought.

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:50.620
That's one.

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.660
The related one that has
to do with fossil fuels

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.657
is it's also far more difficult
to produce than I thought.

00:03:56.657 --> 00:03:58.240
So cheap, plentiful,
reliable energy's

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:59.980
far more important
to human flourishing

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.160
than I thought and it's far
more difficult to produce

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.520
and therefore to
replace than I thought.

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:11.080
I mean, I had had a general
idea that energy was important,

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:14.020
but until I started studying
the history of energy,

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:17.170
which I ran into on a random
project on Rockefeller's

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:20.260
antitrust case, until I started
studying the history of energy,

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.580
I didn't really have a sense
that this is the industry that

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.560
powers every other industry.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.860
So when energy is cheap,
plentiful, and reliable,

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.410
and to the extent it's cheap,
plentiful, and reliable,

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.080
everything else is cheaper and
more plentiful and reliable.

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.250
And the reverse is true.

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.980
Every penny energy
becomes more expensive,

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.090
everything else
becomes more expensive.

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:42.550
So it's like those
Walmart falling

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.210
prices you've seen,
those things go down,

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:47.814
or the pump at a gas station.

00:04:47.814 --> 00:04:50.230
It's like when energy goes
down in price, everything else,

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:51.610
all things being
equal goes down.

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.291
When it goes up,
everything goes up.

00:04:53.291 --> 00:04:55.540
And at the same time, when
I was studying the history,

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:57.790
I realized that--

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:00.869
I started asking, well, why
do we use some forms of energy

00:05:00.869 --> 00:05:01.660
relative to others?

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.730
Because it was just an axiom
that we use gasoline for cars.

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:05.520
That's just there.

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.589
And we seem to use
fossil fuels a lot.

00:05:07.589 --> 00:05:09.130
But I realize there
has actually been

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:13.000
enormous amounts of competition
in the energy industry

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.550
throughout its
history, and oil itself

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:17.950
was the winner in a
competition of about

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:20.950
six different alternatives.

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:23.110
And the gasoline
car was the winner

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:25.810
in a market that had
ethanol, which was--

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:27.887
Henry Ford's first
cars and ethanol car,

00:05:27.887 --> 00:05:29.470
and they had a battery
car, as we like

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:31.480
to call it, an electric car.

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.670
And what I saw
throughout history

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:37.510
was there were lots of
ways of producing energy,

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:39.940
but it was very, very
difficult to make it cheap,

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:44.570
plentiful, and reliable on a
scale of billions of people.

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:49.230
And so what this made me start
thinking about is when we're

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:51.990
talking about replacing
fossil fuels or the problems

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:54.750
of fossil fuels, is
it possible that there

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:56.760
are some unique benefits
of fossil fuels,

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.290
in terms of being
cheap, plentiful,

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:00.300
and reliable for
billions of people

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:04.290
that we're not appreciating or
taking into account, just as we

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:07.950
have to take into account any
potential unique negatives

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:09.760
of fossil fuels?

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:11.337
But those I had heard about.

00:06:11.337 --> 00:06:13.170
And so I started studying
the energy debate.

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:15.503
I got interested in this
question of what form of energy

00:06:15.503 --> 00:06:17.700
is really best for human
flourishing, or what

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:19.540
forms or what policy?

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:21.990
And I observed-- I
thought, and this

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:23.870
is from a philosophical
perspective,

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:26.130
I thought there are three
big problems with the energy

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:28.030
debate, as it stands.

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:31.140
One is that it's biased.

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:34.080
And what I noticed was certain
with certain forms of energy,

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.710
all I ever heard was
positives, that would mainly

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:38.729
be solar and wind,
and then with others,

00:06:38.729 --> 00:06:40.020
all I ever heard was negatives.

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:43.440
But then when I researched the
different production processes,

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:45.720
I found that it's actually
far more dangerous

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:48.810
to mine for the raw materials
in wind turbines, rare earth

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:49.890
metals.

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:53.250
So that doesn't mean that
coal is better than wind,

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:55.980
but it does mean that we're
not looking at negatives of one

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:58.410
and we are looking at
negatives of another.

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:00.660
And if we're doing that,
how are we ever going

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:02.380
to get to the right decision?

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:05.260
So it would be like, for
example, with vaccines.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.680
If you just were making
a decision about,

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:10.890
do I vaccinate my
child and you only

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:12.880
looked at the
negatives of vaccines.

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:15.540
You said, hey, vaccines
have side effects.

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:17.250
And you didn't look
at the positives.

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:19.441
Well, when would you ever
vaccinate your child?

00:07:19.441 --> 00:07:21.690
Well, never, because all you
could see were negatives.

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:23.460
But if you looked
at both sides, you

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:25.210
might come to a very
different conclusion.

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:28.370
So we can't be biased
in our thinking.

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:30.390
Again, this is not about
whether fossil fuels

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:32.250
are the right solution
in a given context.

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:33.791
It's about what's
the framework we're

00:07:33.791 --> 00:07:36.510
going to use to make
these decisions based

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:38.860
on the current facts and
then as facts change.

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:41.160
How can we have a
framework that adapts?

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:45.390
The second one is that it's not
only biased but it's sloppy.

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:47.590
So let's take the
issue of CO2 levels.

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:50.010
There is a concern
that because CO2

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:52.650
as a warming agent of sorts,
it's a greenhouse gas,

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:55.350
or technically, it's
an infrared absorber,

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:58.599
when we increased the level
of CO2 in the atmosphere,

00:07:58.599 --> 00:08:00.390
we might expect it to
have a warming impact

00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:02.764
and that's something that's
important to study and to see

00:08:02.764 --> 00:08:04.500
how significant is this.

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:08.610
But what I found is when people
were talking about CO2 levels,

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:10.710
they talked about
it very sloppily.

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:13.050
They would just say
things like, do you

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:16.010
believe that climate
change is real?

00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:19.160
But that doesn't really
help me if I know--

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:22.070
I could believe that CO2
has some impact but not

00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:24.260
a significant impact,
or a significant impact

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.090
but not a catastrophic impact.

00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:29.199
And that's going to make all
the difference in the world.

00:08:29.199 --> 00:08:29.990
We can't be sloppy.

00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:33.650
So for example, if you say,
oh, there's sea level rise.

00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:35.925
CO2 levels contribute
to sea level rise.

00:08:35.925 --> 00:08:38.450
Well, is it a one
foot contribution

00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:43.789
in the next century, as one of
the major UN organization says?

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:47.720
Or is at 20 feet, as Al Gore
says "An Inconvenient Truth"?

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:52.680
Those magnitudes make an
enormous, enormous difference.

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:54.560
So to use the vaccines
example again,

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:57.779
it would be like you're deciding
whether to vaccinate your child

00:08:57.779 --> 00:09:00.320
and somebody says to you-- and
you say, well, how significant

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:01.194
are the side effects?

00:09:01.194 --> 00:09:03.875
And they just say vaccine
side effects are real.

00:09:03.875 --> 00:09:06.320
And you say, I know, but I
want to know the magnitude.

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:09.560
And they say, what are you,
a vaccine side effect denier?

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:11.120
Don't question me.

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:13.250
Or maybe they would call
it body change, right?

00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:15.080
Are you a body change denier?

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:16.580
Body change is real.

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:18.960
And you think, but this is
not a helpful way of thinking.

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:20.120
This is sloppy.

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:23.320
What I want is I want
the full context.

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:25.070
I want to know the
positives and negatives

00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:27.680
and I want to know
the magnitudes.

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:30.940
So it's biased and it's sloppy.

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:34.300
Now the third thing, and this
is the most controversial,

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:36.640
and for me, the
most important, is

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:41.240
that I think the debate
is extremely anti-human.

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:43.240
So one form in
which I observe this

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:46.380
is the issue of CO2,
greenhouse gases.

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:51.350
You have many people
in our culture saying

00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:53.360
that this is the biggest
problem of our time,

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:56.180
that we're increasing the
amount of CO2 in the atmosphere

00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:59.360
by producing the form of energy
that we dominantly produce.

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:02.360
So you would think that priority
number one would be, OK, let's

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:06.500
find the most efficient,
scalable ways on that premise

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:09.921
to produce non-CO2
emitting energy.

00:10:09.921 --> 00:10:12.170
And then if you look, there
are two overwhelming forms

00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:13.544
of energy,
historically, that can

00:10:13.544 --> 00:10:16.940
do this in a relatively cheap,
plentiful, and reliable way,

00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:19.020
to some extent,
hydroelectric power, which

00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:21.290
can do it where you can
do it, but you can't you

00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:23.420
can't do it everywhere
but it's significant,

00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:26.540
and then nuclear power, which,
at least for electricity,

00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:30.160
theoretically, you
can do anywhere.

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:32.680
And then I observe, OK, who
are the biggest opponents

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:34.090
of these forms of power?

00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:36.760
Who are the people who
most want to stop them?

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:39.160
And it's not the
fossil fuel industry.

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:41.470
It's not Republicans.

00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:43.860
It's not even Donald Trump.

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:47.504
It's the anti-fossil
fuel movement, the vast,

00:10:47.504 --> 00:10:49.670
vast majority of people who
are against fossil fuels

00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:50.720
in the public debate--

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:53.136
I know it's a little different
in the tech community-- are

00:10:53.136 --> 00:10:55.340
rabidly anti-nuclear.

00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:57.110
And when I looked at
their arguments, well

00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:59.210
they say, oh, we
care about safety.

00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:01.430
And I think, well,
wouldn't you be willing,

00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:03.050
even if there were
some safety risks,

00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:04.716
wouldn't you be willing
to accept those,

00:11:04.716 --> 00:11:08.030
if you could save the
world on your own premise?

00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:09.830
And then I look at
the safety stats

00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:12.620
and by far, the safest
form of power ever devised

00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:15.286
is nuclear power, which you
can ask questions about later,

00:11:15.286 --> 00:11:17.160
and the same thing with
hydro, and I realized

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:18.380
on what's going on here.

00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:21.530
With hydro, people are using
explanations like, well,

00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:24.410
they're interfering with
free-flowing rivers,

00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:25.940
and with nuclear,
well, it's just--

00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:27.740
we shouldn't-- it's unnatural.

00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:29.407
You know, it creates
this radioactivity.

00:11:29.407 --> 00:11:30.906
And you say, OK,
well, radioactivity

00:11:30.906 --> 00:11:31.656
exists everywhere.

00:11:31.656 --> 00:11:32.406
What's wrong that?

00:11:32.406 --> 00:11:34.250
And it's like, no, but
we shouldn't make it.

00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:37.960
And what I got is-- and
this is from philosophy--

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:41.380
the goal, then, the goal
that's animating this is not,

00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:44.080
let's do what's best
for human beings.

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:46.600
It's let's be natural.

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:48.520
Let's not interrupt nature.

00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:49.750
Let's be green.

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:55.100
And I summarize it this way,
let's minimize human impact.

00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:57.520
So it seems like many people
when they're discussing

00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:01.600
this issue, they're not
trying to do what I would say

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:03.790
is the goal, is to
maximize human flourishing,

00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:06.970
to come up with the best
policy for human beings.

00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:10.600
We're talking about
minimizing impact.

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:14.080
And even the way we talk
about climate reveals this,

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:17.380
because we don't talk about
climate danger or climate

00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:19.810
livability, which
are human terms.

00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:24.250
We talk about climate change,
as if change, as such, is bad.

00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:28.300
And so this is an
anti-impact idea.

00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:31.250
It's the idea that we
should not impact nature.

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:32.500
We should minimize our impact.

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:34.480
Not because it
hurts us, but just

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:36.160
because we shouldn't do it.

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:39.580
And it's important to make
a decision in our framework,

00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:42.910
are we prioritizing
human beings or not?

00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:45.190
And I think it's
important, then, to study.

00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:47.510
There are basically
two perspectives.

00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:49.540
So the minimum
impact perspective

00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:51.130
has a certain view
of the relationship

00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:52.840
between humans and nature.

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:55.540
And I call it the
perfect planet premise.

00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:59.470
And the perfect planet premise
is that nature is, sorry,

00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:02.410
stable, safe, and sufficient.

00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:07.150
So by its nature, nature is
stable, safe, and sufficient,

00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:09.370
and it will take care of us.

00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:11.170
Mother nature is
really our mother.

00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:13.240
It will take care
of us if we just

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:15.820
don't rock the boat too much,
if we don't change things,

00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:18.220
if we don't destabilize it.

00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:23.350
But we have this capacity
of changing things a lot,

00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:26.082
and we're generally regarded
as polluter parasites.

00:13:26.082 --> 00:13:28.540
When you hear people talk about
human environmental impact,

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:29.320
they don't say--

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:31.120
they never think of
that as a good thing.

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:32.280
It's always a bad thing.

00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:34.990
But you never hear anyone
talk about bear impact

00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:37.850
as a bad thing or beaver
impact as a bad thing.

00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:42.130
So human beings are considered
this uniquely anti-planet

00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:46.210
creature who just basically
we pollute it, the planet,

00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:46.960
and we plunder it.

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:48.543
And if that's your
view, if you really

00:13:48.543 --> 00:13:50.290
believe that mother
nature is our mother

00:13:50.290 --> 00:13:52.630
and that the planet is
perfect the way it is,

00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:54.760
or the way it was
without us, then yeah,

00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:57.430
your goal should be let's
just not touch anything

00:13:57.430 --> 00:13:59.290
and it will be like
the Garden of Eden.

00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:02.920
But this is really how we
hear people talk about things.

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:04.600
We talk about the
climate, as in,

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:08.050
the perfect climate as the
one that we grew up in.

00:14:08.050 --> 00:14:09.850
Now, the perfectible
planet premise--

00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:11.080
and this is my premise--

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:12.190
is very different.

00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:16.990
So this views the planet
as not stable, but dynamic,

00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:21.430
not safe but dangerous, not
sufficient but deficient.

00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:23.890
So it says the planet
is an amazing place.

00:14:23.890 --> 00:14:26.740
Its got amazing
potential, but without us

00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:29.620
with radically
transforming it, we're

00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:31.480
going to have life
expectancies of 30.

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:33.760
We're going to be at
the mercy of nature.

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:37.034
So our attitude needs
to be, let's perfect it.

00:14:37.034 --> 00:14:37.950
And that's what we do.

00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:39.430
We are perfecter producers.

00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:42.070
So we can make things worse.

00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:46.240
We can also make things
a lot, lot better.

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:48.870
And so the goal of
someone on this premise

00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:51.120
is to maximize human
flourishing through

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:53.570
intelligent transformation.

00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:55.000
So I describe my
framework, if you

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.856
want two terms would
be full context.

00:14:58.856 --> 00:15:01.230
You want to look carefully at
the positives and negatives

00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:02.380
and then human flourishing.

00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:05.140
We measure goodness
by how much--

00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:10.100
by maximizing human flourishing,
not minimizing human impact.

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:12.610
And so my goal in
going into this

00:15:12.610 --> 00:15:17.770
was that I disliked the
whole framework of the debate

00:15:17.770 --> 00:15:19.840
on both sides, I should say.

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:22.020
So conservatives are just
as guilty of this, often.

00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:25.510
So for example, when they
attack wind turbines, what's

00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:29.530
the number one
argument they give?

00:15:29.530 --> 00:15:31.890
Is that it kills birds.

00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:34.780
OK, but if by putting up
a lot of wind turbines,

00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:37.480
we could save the earth
from ecological apocalypse,

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:40.420
we should be willing to kill
a lot of birds to do that.

00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:42.100
And cats already
kill a lot of birds,

00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:45.210
so it's not like killing birds
is the end of the world, right?

00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:48.550
Now, the American Wind
Association points this out,

00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:50.780
and they're right to point
that kind of thing out.

00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:53.695
So you just see that people
aren't on a pro-human premise.

00:15:53.695 --> 00:15:55.650
Now, my goal was I
want to understand,

00:15:55.650 --> 00:15:59.920
from a pro-human, full context
perspective, what's actually

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:02.230
good for human flourishing.

00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:04.310
And to do that, we
need to look at both

00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:09.220
the potential unique benefits of
fossil fuel access, fossil fuel

00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:11.580
energy, and that includes
access to energy,

00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:13.480
and it also includes
maybe CO2 could

00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:16.090
have some benefits, and then
potentially unique risks,

00:16:16.090 --> 00:16:19.760
the risks of CO2 pollution
and then depletion.

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:23.930
So running out of them or
running out of other resources.

00:16:23.930 --> 00:16:26.000
So I'm spending a lot
of time on the framework

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.380
because I think that's what's
most distinct in my viewpoint.

00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:33.080
And I actually think that if
everyone used this framework,

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:37.460
my conclusion would be
relatively uncontroversial.

00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:39.410
So I think actually
what the problem--

00:16:39.410 --> 00:16:41.540
my disagreement with
the debate is not

00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:43.649
that I have different
facts but that I

00:16:43.649 --> 00:16:44.690
have different framework.

00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:47.204
And in fact, my book "Moral
Case for Fossil Fuels,"

00:16:47.204 --> 00:16:49.370
is the only book that I'm
aware of in the field that

00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:51.270
only uses first hand data.

00:16:51.270 --> 00:16:53.170
It has no quotations
from experts.

00:16:53.170 --> 00:16:54.260
It has no one else.

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:56.752
It relies on nothing but
analysis of the data,

00:16:56.752 --> 00:16:59.210
all of which can be recreated
at, for anyone who's watching

00:16:59.210 --> 00:17:00.960
online, moralcaseforfoss
ilfuels.com/data.

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:05.450
For So you can see
all the data sources.

00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:08.359
Now, so let's go through unique
benefits, potentially unique

00:17:08.359 --> 00:17:11.740
benefits, and then unique risks.

00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:13.460
Now, one counter
might be, well, there

00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:16.670
are no potentially unique
benefits to fossil fuels.

00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:20.062
And this poster nicely
encapsulates that.

00:17:20.062 --> 00:17:23.550
So the idea is, OK, let's
say there isn't a climate

00:17:23.550 --> 00:17:24.420
catastrophe.

00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:26.550
Let's say we pass
mass restrictions

00:17:26.550 --> 00:17:28.349
on fossil fuel use.

00:17:28.349 --> 00:17:29.880
Who really cares?

00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:32.590
Because we'll ultimately
get just super,

00:17:32.590 --> 00:17:36.460
super cheap energy and
everything will be great.

00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:41.290
So I think that
this should at least

00:17:41.290 --> 00:17:44.290
be looked at with
skepticism, particularly

00:17:44.290 --> 00:17:46.450
with when people talk
about solar energy

00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:48.640
as free and forever,
which Al Gore does.

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:51.280
Or they'll say
enough solar energy

00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:53.680
hits the surface of the
Earth every minute to power

00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:55.690
the whole world for a year.

00:17:55.690 --> 00:17:58.070
There's something
really off with this.

00:17:58.070 --> 00:17:58.637
Otherwise.

00:17:58.637 --> 00:18:00.970
This technology has been
around for well over 100 years.

00:18:00.970 --> 00:18:03.780
Why aren't we doing it?

00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:05.530
So you might think,
well, we are doing it.

00:18:05.530 --> 00:18:07.090
And I watched the
other day, I got

00:18:07.090 --> 00:18:10.240
a preview of Al Gore's movie,
"An Inconvenient Sequel."

00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:12.550
And from watching
that treatment,

00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:14.800
I would have guessed that
the world is at something

00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:17.110
like 50% solar and wind,
because there were just

00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:19.870
all of these inspiring
anecdotes about this place

00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:23.124
and this place and this place
and this place uses 100%.

00:18:23.124 --> 00:18:25.540
And most of the audience had
no idea what the numbers are.

00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:27.480
But the numbers
are solar and wind

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:31.390
are, despite massive investment
and massive subsidy, 2%

00:18:31.390 --> 00:18:34.266
still, of global
energy production.

00:18:34.266 --> 00:18:35.890
And we can see as I
take the year 1980,

00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:38.590
because it's the year I
was born and looking back,

00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:40.180
my parents were
also told that they

00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:43.030
needed to get off fossil fuels.

00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:45.670
And if we look at
to the present,

00:18:45.670 --> 00:18:47.410
we're using way
more fossil fuels,

00:18:47.410 --> 00:18:49.750
and fossil fuels are actually
the-- in terms of actual

00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:51.130
production--

00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:53.020
fossil fuels are the
fastest growing source

00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:54.500
of energy in the world.

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:57.460
So there's something going
on there, unless you just

00:18:57.460 --> 00:19:00.940
believe there's some massive
conspiracy against solar

00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:03.010
and wind.

00:19:03.010 --> 00:19:04.570
Now, what you should
be suspicious of

00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:05.944
is the fact that
when people talk

00:19:05.944 --> 00:19:08.500
about replacing fossil fuels,
they only talk about solar

00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:09.250
and wind.

00:19:09.250 --> 00:19:11.800
They don't talk about
nuclear and hydro.

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:16.390
And again, that's because
there's this anti-impact bias

00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:18.460
and solar and wind
are viewed as natural.

00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:21.130
So people are focused on, let's
use a natural or renewable

00:19:21.130 --> 00:19:25.540
source versus a non-carbon
source or a low polluting

00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:27.330
source.

00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:31.740
Now they asked me if
I had a video to show,

00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:36.160
and apparently I lied because
I said no, and then I did.

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:38.830
So I will play the
role of Jimmy Fallon.

00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:40.570
No, I won't.

00:19:40.570 --> 00:19:43.420
There's a good video
which I cite in the book,

00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:45.157
and the basic idea
is it was in 2000,

00:19:45.157 --> 00:19:46.990
and remember, I wasn't
interested in energy.

00:19:46.990 --> 00:19:49.780
This really struck me that
he was on to something.

00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:53.200
He said-- there was this
article in "New Scientist"

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:56.980
magazine that said, "New
Scientist" magazine just

00:19:56.980 --> 00:20:00.616
reported that cars can
now run on hazelnuts.

00:20:00.616 --> 00:20:01.990
And then Jimmy
Fallon said, yeah,

00:20:01.990 --> 00:20:05.260
that's reassuring,
because humans cost

00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:08.560
like $8 for a bottle this big.

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:10.060
You know, what about
a car that runs

00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:11.980
on bald eagle heads
or Faberge eggs?

00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:15.280
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:17.920
And I thought later,
wait a second,

00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:21.975
but isn't hazelnut
energy renewable energy?

00:20:21.975 --> 00:20:23.350
Isn't it renewable
energy, right?

00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:24.490
It comes from the sun.

00:20:24.490 --> 00:20:26.350
So why is it so expensive.

00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:28.990
And it illustrates
this profound point

00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:30.634
that we need to
understand to evaluate

00:20:30.634 --> 00:20:32.050
different sources
of energy, which

00:20:32.050 --> 00:20:34.120
is that energy is a process.

00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:37.070
Energy is not a single
material, it's a process.

00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:40.600
So when we talk about solar
energy or wind energy or coal,

00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:42.850
it can be misleading
because the question is,

00:20:42.850 --> 00:20:46.000
what is the entire process that
includes but is not limited

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.704
to those elements that produces
the end product that we want,

00:20:49.704 --> 00:20:51.245
and maybe end products
that we don't.

00:20:51.245 --> 00:20:53.350
So we have to look
at the whole process,

00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:54.970
so all of these
different variables,

00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:58.300
from mining to
transportation to disposal.

00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:01.150
So when people talk about
things like zero emissions

00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:03.250
or no pollution,
usually they're only

00:21:03.250 --> 00:21:05.050
looking at one part
of the process.

00:21:05.050 --> 00:21:08.380
And when people have wildly
optimistic expectations

00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:12.160
about some new source of energy,
like, let's say, hydrogen,

00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:15.010
they have no idea what's going
into manufacturing the hydrogen

00:21:15.010 --> 00:21:15.510
fuel.

00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:17.301
They just think, oh,
hydrogen's in the air.

00:21:17.301 --> 00:21:20.170
It's in reality, so that'll
make it super, super cheap.

00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:23.870
So we have to recognize,
no, energy is a process.

00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:27.430
So there are different things
that can make a form of energy

00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:29.520
expensive.

00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:32.160
I think the biggest one and
the most problematic part

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:36.640
of a process is if the
process is unreliable,

00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:39.780
if it cannot generate
energy on demand.

00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:44.310
And this is the problem that
solar and wind run into.

00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:47.160
Now, solar and wind,
it's very weird

00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:49.260
this classification
of renewables,

00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:52.800
because it, in our actual
law, usually excludes

00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:56.820
hydroelectric power, even
though that's plenty renewable

00:21:56.820 --> 00:21:58.530
if you think of
things in those terms,

00:21:58.530 --> 00:22:00.030
if you think of
things as renewable.

00:22:00.030 --> 00:22:01.980
So again, there's this
green bias that, oh,

00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:03.330
it has too much impact.

00:22:03.330 --> 00:22:05.670
It has nothing to do with CO2.

00:22:05.670 --> 00:22:07.650
But I think solar and
wind are properly--

00:22:07.650 --> 00:22:08.970
I do not call them renewables.

00:22:08.970 --> 00:22:10.710
I call them
unreliables, because I

00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:13.680
think that is the distinctive
quality, because the energy we

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:16.240
get is not on demand.

00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:19.290
And so what happens
is that, well,

00:22:19.290 --> 00:22:20.750
let's look at the
case of Germany,

00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:22.500
which is supposed to
be the model country.

00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:25.844
It's invested hundreds
of billions of dollars

00:22:25.844 --> 00:22:27.510
or spent hundreds of
billions of dollars

00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:29.970
in subsidizing solar and wind.

00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:31.530
Well, according to
today's rhetoric,

00:22:31.530 --> 00:22:33.180
that should make it
cheaper, because you will

00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:34.304
hear all these cost things.

00:22:34.304 --> 00:22:37.560
But those cost things
never take into account

00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:40.830
the fact that if you have
unreliables on a system,

00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:44.010
you need them backed
up almost 100%,

00:22:44.010 --> 00:22:46.800
and so that's why
Germany keeps building

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:49.170
a lot of new coal plants.

00:22:49.170 --> 00:22:51.840
And so in practice, the
Germans pay three times more

00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:55.310
for electricity, sometimes
four, depending on conversion,

00:22:55.310 --> 00:22:57.570
than people in the US do.

00:22:57.570 --> 00:23:01.560
And that said, only about
10% of their entire energy

00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:03.090
comes from these unreliables.

00:23:03.090 --> 00:23:06.110
The more they use,
the more it costs.

00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:09.330
So there's an immense amount
of dishonesty and bias

00:23:09.330 --> 00:23:11.760
in the energy discussion,
because the privileged forms

00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:13.920
of energy, people who
aren't looking carefully

00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:14.990
at the process.

00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:16.740
And then the other
forms of energy, people

00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:18.210
don't appreciate.

00:23:18.210 --> 00:23:21.447
So I think that if you
look at the entire--

00:23:21.447 --> 00:23:23.280
if you actually look
at the data, and again,

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:25.208
this is on the website,
moralcaseforfoss

00:23:25.208 --> 00:23:27.830
ilfuels.com/data, if
you look at the data,

00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:29.580
you look at the different
forms of energy,

00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:34.200
I think what you conclude
is that fossil fuel energy,

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:37.500
for the next several decades,
is uniquely good at producing

00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:40.080
energy on a scale of
billions of people.

00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:43.350
Nuclear power probably
has the most potential to,

00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:46.330
except for the green
movement is restricting it.

00:23:46.330 --> 00:23:47.940
And so one of the
huge priorities

00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:51.180
for all sides of the debate,
unless you're just a total--

00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:56.490
unless the green-- unless being
green is really a religion,

00:23:56.490 --> 00:24:00.390
is to liberate nuclear power
and to allow advancement

00:24:00.390 --> 00:24:04.830
in that field and to also
allow hydroelectric power where

00:24:04.830 --> 00:24:05.427
it's possible.

00:24:05.427 --> 00:24:07.260
So I think those are
still the biggest ones,

00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:08.640
and of course, we
want innovation

00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:12.030
in these other areas,
but fossil fuel energy

00:24:12.030 --> 00:24:14.790
is uniquely good at this point.

00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:16.710
Now, this is
particularly important

00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:19.290
because it's not that we
have a world where everyone

00:24:19.290 --> 00:24:23.159
has plenty of energy and we just
need to substitute something.

00:24:23.159 --> 00:24:25.200
First of all, we don't
have nearly enough energy.

00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:26.741
If we had a lot more
energy, we could

00:24:26.741 --> 00:24:31.200
do things like desalinate sea
water and irrigate deserts

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:33.070
and solve all sorts of problems.

00:24:33.070 --> 00:24:35.850
But there are 1.2 billion
people in the world

00:24:35.850 --> 00:24:38.190
with no electricity.

00:24:38.190 --> 00:24:38.910
Think about that.

00:24:38.910 --> 00:24:42.600
No electricity, no light
bulb, no refrigerator,

00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:44.870
no modern hospital, none.

00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:49.800
And then on top of that, there
are 2.7 billion people who

00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:51.810
have so little energy,
they're in such a state

00:24:51.810 --> 00:24:56.330
of energy poverty that
they use wood and dung

00:24:56.330 --> 00:24:58.840
to cook and heat their homes.

00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:01.740
So we have a world where
basically 3 billion people

00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:05.550
are wretchedly energy poor.

00:25:05.550 --> 00:25:08.940
So the energy question is not
just how to keep our energy,

00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:12.030
but how to produce
more energy, which

00:25:12.030 --> 00:25:15.150
means that, given fossil
fuels' unique ability

00:25:15.150 --> 00:25:18.300
to be resource efficient and
produce energy on this scale,

00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:20.850
it doesn't prove that they
don't have problems, or even

00:25:20.850 --> 00:25:24.160
big problems, but it does prove
there's a huge burden of proof

00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:26.240
in restricting the
use of fossil fuels.

00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:30.300
So if you talk about, hey,
let's tax them or let's--

00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:32.970
as many people
advocate-- let's strive

00:25:32.970 --> 00:25:35.460
to get rid of 80%
of fossil fuel use,

00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:38.410
current fossil fuel
use by the year 2050,

00:25:38.410 --> 00:25:40.530
when there will be an
even bigger population.

00:25:40.530 --> 00:25:43.319
That is a really
serious thing to do.

00:25:43.319 --> 00:25:45.360
And when you hear those
things, don't think of it

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:47.234
as, oh, yeah, it's just
sort of like buying--

00:25:47.234 --> 00:25:48.440
I'm going to buy a Tesla.

00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:49.710
It is not even--

00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:52.869
Tesla's a massively impressive
fossil fuel car, at this stage,

00:25:52.869 --> 00:25:55.160
in terms of the amount of
fossil fuels that go into it.

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:55.920
And it's great.

00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:57.510
It's a great kind
of invention and we

00:25:57.510 --> 00:25:59.093
want to support those
things, I just--

00:25:59.093 --> 00:26:01.980
we shouldn't be giving them
a lot of subsidies, I think.

00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:03.990
But this is just a--

00:26:03.990 --> 00:26:06.690
you're talking about a massive
disruption in people's lives,

00:26:06.690 --> 00:26:08.260
particularly the poorest people.

00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:11.950
So at the very least, you cannot
advocate these kinds of things

00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:13.771
casually.

00:26:13.771 --> 00:26:15.600
Now, let's talk
about the concerns.

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:17.190
So there are three
major concerns

00:26:17.190 --> 00:26:20.350
about fossil fuels,
catastrophic resource depletion,

00:26:20.350 --> 00:26:24.210
so running out of fossil fuels
or overall consuming more

00:26:24.210 --> 00:26:24.810
than we can.

00:26:24.810 --> 00:26:28.350
There's this idea of
we're at overcapacity,

00:26:28.350 --> 00:26:31.920
where we're wearing out
our welcome on the planet.

00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:35.730
Catastrophic pollution,
so by using fossil fuels,

00:26:35.730 --> 00:26:39.090
leaving aside CO2, there are all
these destructive byproducts.

00:26:39.090 --> 00:26:41.260
And then of course,
catastrophic climate change,

00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:44.250
which is that we're elevating
CO2 levels and other greenhouse

00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:46.170
gas levels to the
point where there's

00:26:46.170 --> 00:26:48.610
runaway warming and
catastrophic climate change.

00:26:48.610 --> 00:26:50.580
I want to focus on
the climate issue,

00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:53.700
because I think it's the
issue of most concern today,

00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:55.890
and I think it's also
the most plausible.

00:26:55.890 --> 00:27:01.440
The depletion issue has lost
a lot of steam in recent years

00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:03.900
because most of the
development people

00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:07.710
call fracking or shale energy,
which is that the oil and gas

00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:12.360
industry has been able to take
a useless rock that was known

00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:14.820
to contain some
amount of oil and gas

00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:18.330
but we couldn't get it out,
and to economically get it out.

00:27:18.330 --> 00:27:20.660
And so that, for decades
and decades and decades

00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:23.760
going forth, has alleviated
fears of running out of oil.

00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:26.340
And oil is the hardest
to replace fossil fuel.

00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:29.100
Coal, you have probably
thousands of years left,

00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:31.629
even of known deposits.

00:27:31.629 --> 00:27:33.420
But it is important,
I think, to understand

00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:35.070
the general mechanism.

00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:37.560
And this chart is
interesting because I

00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:39.720
think what it shows
is that as we-- it

00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:43.390
shows the consumption at the
bottom goes up a little bit.

00:27:43.390 --> 00:27:45.210
So what it shows--
and then proved

00:27:45.210 --> 00:27:46.890
reserves is basically
in inventory,

00:27:46.890 --> 00:27:51.300
so it means the more we
use, the more we have.

00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:53.430
I think this is a really
profound kind of thing,

00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:57.780
and what it illustrates
in the case of oil

00:27:57.780 --> 00:28:01.920
is that nature doesn't
just give us a lake of oil

00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:03.630
and then we're draining
it with a straw

00:28:03.630 --> 00:28:05.070
and then we're halfway through.

00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:07.980
Nature is full of
potential oil in all

00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:10.680
these different rock deposits,
but it takes human ingenuity

00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:12.280
to make it valuable.

00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:15.840
It takes human ingenuity
to find it, to get it,

00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:16.860
and to refine it.

00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:20.790
Back in the 1850s, before
the oil industry began,

00:28:20.790 --> 00:28:21.960
oil was a nuisance.

00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:22.910
It was useless.

00:28:22.910 --> 00:28:26.010
It was something people
sold as fake medicine

00:28:26.010 --> 00:28:29.220
or that got in the way when
they were searching for salt.

00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:32.460
So the principle, which
is really important,

00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:35.190
to having optimism about
humanity, including

00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:38.580
about energy, is that human
beings are resource producers

00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:40.920
or resource creators.

00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:43.860
A resource is not
something nature gives us.

00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:46.650
It's some-- nature
gives us a raw material

00:28:46.650 --> 00:28:47.880
and we make it usable.

00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:50.430
So aluminum is not
a natural resource

00:28:50.430 --> 00:28:52.170
because it's not
naturally a resource.

00:28:52.170 --> 00:28:53.580
It's naturally useless.

00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:55.440
Oil isn't a natural resource.

00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:56.730
Coal isn't a natural resource.

00:28:56.730 --> 00:28:58.110
Gas isn't a natural resource.

00:28:58.110 --> 00:28:59.700
Uranium isn't a
natural resource.

00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:03.340
All of these things
are resources

00:29:03.340 --> 00:29:06.460
only to the extent human
beings can transform them

00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:08.500
into usable things, and
the whole world is just

00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:11.260
a pile of potential resources.

00:29:11.260 --> 00:29:13.997
So we should never be worried
about running out of oil

00:29:13.997 --> 00:29:15.830
or running out of coal
or running out of gas

00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:17.830
or running out of resources.

00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:20.740
We should only be worried
about running out of freedom,

00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:23.920
because as long as we're free,
we can keep figuring out ways

00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:26.540
to transform raw
materials into resources,

00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:28.390
and as we progress with
the kinds of things

00:29:28.390 --> 00:29:30.610
that Google and lots of
other amazing companies do,

00:29:30.610 --> 00:29:33.310
our effective intelligence
just multiplies over and over

00:29:33.310 --> 00:29:35.050
and over so who
knows what we'll be

00:29:35.050 --> 00:29:38.530
able to turn into a resource?

00:29:38.530 --> 00:29:40.780
So that's a depletion one.

00:29:40.780 --> 00:29:44.290
The pollution one is
important because I

00:29:44.290 --> 00:29:46.930
think it's worth noting
that when people talk

00:29:46.930 --> 00:29:51.412
about the effects of
energy on environment,

00:29:51.412 --> 00:29:52.870
they only talk
about negative ones.

00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:55.150
So there's this idea
of there's clean energy

00:29:55.150 --> 00:29:56.350
and there's dirty energy.

00:29:56.350 --> 00:29:58.180
That's a problem, first of
all, because every other form

00:29:58.180 --> 00:29:59.700
of energy has
byproducts, so it's

00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:02.230
too binary in classification,
although some are

00:30:02.230 --> 00:30:04.940
cleaner or dirtier than others.

00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:07.310
But I think the thing
that's really missing

00:30:07.310 --> 00:30:11.450
from this narrative is that
energy has an enormous power

00:30:11.450 --> 00:30:13.280
to clean up nature.

00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:15.380
The environment we
live in is the cleanest

00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:18.260
any human being has ever
lived in, in history,

00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:19.730
on average across the planet.

00:30:19.730 --> 00:30:22.490
If our ancestors 300 years
ago, before we started

00:30:22.490 --> 00:30:24.650
using fossil fuels,
before we industrialized

00:30:24.650 --> 00:30:26.510
could see our environment
and we asked them,

00:30:26.510 --> 00:30:28.437
who has a better
environment, you or us?

00:30:28.437 --> 00:30:30.020
They would think it
was a joke, right?

00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:32.930
They were living in filth,
in human filth and animal

00:30:32.930 --> 00:30:35.870
filth, surrounded by disease.

00:30:35.870 --> 00:30:38.510
Nature doesn't give
us a clean environment

00:30:38.510 --> 00:30:39.560
that we then make dirty.

00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:42.680
It gives us a dirty
environment that we make clean.

00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:44.870
So when we're analyzing
the environmental impact

00:30:44.870 --> 00:30:46.640
of different forms
of energy, we have

00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:49.679
to look at both how it cleans
and how it makes things dirty,

00:30:49.679 --> 00:30:52.220
because if you say, oh, I don't
want this energy because it's

00:30:52.220 --> 00:30:54.930
dirty, but then you
lose the energy.

00:30:54.930 --> 00:30:57.470
So for example, there's a
reason for this correlation

00:30:57.470 --> 00:31:00.950
here, which is with
cleanliness of water and use

00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:03.830
of fossil fuels, which to
date, is most of energy use,

00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:07.520
because you need
water to purify--

00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:10.280
you need energy to purify
naturally dirty water

00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:11.720
and to transport
it from where it

00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:14.240
is to where you need it to be.

00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:17.900
Now it doesn't have to be
fossil fuels, theoretically,

00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:20.776
but given that fossil fuels
are the most practical form

00:31:20.776 --> 00:31:22.400
of energy for billions
of people today,

00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:24.210
it does have to be fossil fuels.

00:31:24.210 --> 00:31:26.090
So when you deprive
people of fossil fuels,

00:31:26.090 --> 00:31:28.350
you deprive them of
things like clean water.

00:31:28.350 --> 00:31:29.750
Now, what about
actual pollution?

00:31:29.750 --> 00:31:34.490
I think this chart does a good
job of showing what's possible.

00:31:34.490 --> 00:31:39.650
Using technology, we can
reduce negative byproducts,

00:31:39.650 --> 00:31:42.440
and that's fantastic and we
should continue to do that.

00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:44.900
A modern coal plant, a
truly modern coal plant

00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:48.477
is one of the cleanest
sources of energy in history.

00:31:48.477 --> 00:31:50.060
What we've been able
to do is amazing,

00:31:50.060 --> 00:31:52.580
and what we can continue
to do is amazing.

00:31:52.580 --> 00:31:55.850
So we should absolutely seek
cleaner and cleaner processes.

00:31:55.850 --> 00:31:58.610
But this idea that pollution
is getting worse and worse,

00:31:58.610 --> 00:32:01.350
that's simply not true.

00:32:01.350 --> 00:32:03.810
Now let's talk about the
climate issue in the remainder

00:32:03.810 --> 00:32:05.090
and then we'll have--

00:32:05.090 --> 00:32:08.640
we should have 15 minutes,
solid, for questions.

00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:10.820
So I think of-- because
I'm thinking of this

00:32:10.820 --> 00:32:13.940
all from a human flourishing
based framework, I don't think

00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:15.860
of the issue as climate change.

00:32:15.860 --> 00:32:19.010
I think of the issue as
climate danger, danger

00:32:19.010 --> 00:32:20.360
to the livability of climate.

00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:22.080
What I'm concerned about
is I don't want to--

00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:23.996
I don't care how much
CO2 is in the atmosphere

00:32:23.996 --> 00:32:25.670
or what temperature
is on average,

00:32:25.670 --> 00:32:30.650
but I care if it's helpful
or harmful to human beings.

00:32:30.650 --> 00:32:32.680
So I want to be
clinical about that.

00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:35.432
My question isn't are we
changing anything, but overall,

00:32:35.432 --> 00:32:37.390
are we changing things
for the better or worse,

00:32:37.390 --> 00:32:39.000
and then, if so, how much?

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.780
So I think we need to look at
three dynamics in fossil fuels.

00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:44.230
One is the greenhouse effect.

00:32:44.230 --> 00:32:46.720
That's the warming
the impact of CO2

00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:50.170
and then its consequent other
impacts on the climate system.

00:32:50.170 --> 00:32:54.040
Two is the fertilizer effect,
so this is the plant growth

00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:57.070
promoting aspect of CO2.

00:32:57.070 --> 00:33:00.370
And then third is the
protection effect.

00:33:00.370 --> 00:33:03.250
When we choose to use cheaper
energy from fossil fuels, which

00:33:03.250 --> 00:33:06.530
gives more people
access to energy

00:33:06.530 --> 00:33:10.360
how does that help them protect
themselves from climate, which

00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:13.060
is really important, because
nature doesn't give us

00:33:13.060 --> 00:33:14.770
a safe climate we
make dangerous,

00:33:14.770 --> 00:33:18.850
it gives us a dangerous climate
that we need to make safe.

00:33:18.850 --> 00:33:21.940
And I have to admit, when I
started studying this issue,

00:33:21.940 --> 00:33:25.060
I was still operating with
some of the perfect planet

00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:29.350
premise in mind, because when
I guessed, if you would ask me,

00:33:29.350 --> 00:33:31.330
how much more dangerous
are we making climate?

00:33:31.330 --> 00:33:33.270
I definitely would
not have guessed

00:33:33.270 --> 00:33:36.434
that it's some catastrophe and
that the world is going to end.

00:33:36.434 --> 00:33:38.350
But I definitely thought,
yeah, we're probably

00:33:38.350 --> 00:33:40.720
making it more
dangerous, overall,

00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:42.200
with our use of fossil fuels.

00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:43.370
But it's worth it.

00:33:43.370 --> 00:33:44.680
It's more than worth it.

00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:48.070
I'm willing, you know,
because of the benefits

00:33:48.070 --> 00:33:50.330
of that affordable
energy to so many people.

00:33:50.330 --> 00:33:53.430
But then when I looked at
the data, I was shocked,

00:33:53.430 --> 00:33:55.420
and I was also shocked
that no one had ever

00:33:55.420 --> 00:33:56.920
presented this data,
because I think

00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:58.744
it's the most important data.

00:33:58.744 --> 00:34:00.160
And the data I'm
going to show you

00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:03.340
is the data on what are
called climate related deaths.

00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:06.640
This is a statistic collected
by the International Disaster

00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:09.699
Database, a nonpartisan
international organization,

00:34:09.699 --> 00:34:12.159
and they just they just
aggregate the best records they

00:34:12.159 --> 00:34:15.500
can find of deaths from storms
and floods, extreme heat,

00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:19.360
extreme cold, wildfires,
drought, everything

00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:21.940
that we care about from a
climate perspective, everything

00:34:21.940 --> 00:34:25.940
that in Al Gore's movies seems
to be getting much, much worse.

00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:28.929
So I was curious, how
much worse has it gotten?

00:34:28.929 --> 00:34:30.880
Because I would figure a lot.

00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:34.917
And when I ask people now,
they think in the millions,

00:34:34.917 --> 00:34:37.000
you know, probably millions
of people in the world

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:40.239
are dying from storms
and floods and droughts.

00:34:40.239 --> 00:34:43.610
And there's truth to that.

00:34:43.610 --> 00:34:47.350
And the truth is that
that used to be the case.

00:34:47.350 --> 00:34:50.110
Millions of people a year often
died, particularly adjusted

00:34:50.110 --> 00:34:52.630
for population, several
decades in the '30s,

00:34:52.630 --> 00:34:54.814
you have around 10
million people a year die.

00:34:54.814 --> 00:34:56.730
And that's, I think,
near where we're starting

00:34:56.730 --> 00:34:58.970
to collect decent records.

00:34:58.970 --> 00:35:01.040
But I would doubt
anyone in this room

00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:04.950
can guess how many coin related
deaths were recorded last year.

00:35:04.950 --> 00:35:06.450
Now, here's the
trend, and then I'll

00:35:06.450 --> 00:35:10.230
tell you last year, because
my book was written in--

00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:13.260
the data was from 2013
because it came out in 2014.

00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:15.930
And people think, oh, well, I've
heard these bad reports lately.

00:35:15.930 --> 00:35:17.850
You got lucky cause
it just got really--

00:35:17.850 --> 00:35:20.610
it finally caught up with
us right after your book.

00:35:20.610 --> 00:35:23.766
So when my book came out,
it was around 30,000 climate

00:35:23.766 --> 00:35:24.390
related deaths.

00:35:24.390 --> 00:35:27.370
And you see the trend that
it's going down dramatically.

00:35:27.370 --> 00:35:29.200
We're putting more
CO2 in the atmosphere,

00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:30.575
but it's going
down dramatically.

00:35:30.575 --> 00:35:33.330
I'll explain why this is, but
it's important that it is,

00:35:33.330 --> 00:35:35.610
and it's important that
for several decades,

00:35:35.610 --> 00:35:37.920
people have been claiming
it's going to get worse.

00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:40.320
Bill McKibben, the guy
debated in the '80s,

00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:42.900
said that by now,
it's going to be

00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:46.560
like hell or a place of
a comparable temperature.

00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:49.530
John Holdren, Obama's
chief science adviser,

00:35:49.530 --> 00:35:52.560
predicted in 1986
that a billion people

00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:54.870
would die from
climate related deaths

00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:57.810
due to CO2-induced
famine by the year 2020.

00:35:57.810 --> 00:35:59.832
So three years from now.

00:35:59.832 --> 00:36:01.290
But look at how
this is plummeting.

00:36:01.290 --> 00:36:03.860
It's gone down, if you
average it over the decades,

00:36:03.860 --> 00:36:07.030
by rate of 98%.

00:36:07.030 --> 00:36:10.750
Now, last year, the
current collection we have

00:36:10.750 --> 00:36:15.010
is that 6,114 people
died in the entire world

00:36:15.010 --> 00:36:18.310
from climate-related
causes, 6,114.

00:36:18.310 --> 00:36:22.120
It's very hard to find any
problem in human and humanity

00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:25.864
that has that low of
a number of anything.

00:36:25.864 --> 00:36:28.030
I don't know stapler or
accidents or if they collect

00:36:28.030 --> 00:36:32.080
those, but it's really hard.

00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:36.530
So something is off here.

00:36:36.530 --> 00:36:38.440
So let's examine the effects.

00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:41.110
And I want to just show you
what the aggregate is, first.

00:36:41.110 --> 00:36:43.010
So the effects are--

00:36:43.010 --> 00:36:47.060
this is the greenhouse effect,
which is supposedly making

00:36:47.060 --> 00:36:48.890
things really, really warm.

00:36:48.890 --> 00:36:50.600
The key thing we
have to understand

00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:53.960
is that the demonstrated thing
about the greenhouse effect

00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:55.670
is that it's a
logarithmic, which

00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:58.370
means a decelerating
or diminishing effect.

00:36:58.370 --> 00:37:00.680
Every new molecule
of CO2, when we

00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:02.870
isolate the greenhouse
effect in a lab,

00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:04.060
gets diminishing returns.

00:37:04.060 --> 00:37:06.530
It warms less than the last.

00:37:06.530 --> 00:37:09.140
So what you would expect
is that in the atmosphere,

00:37:09.140 --> 00:37:13.422
as we put more and more CO2
in the atmosphere, it'll warm

00:37:13.422 --> 00:37:14.880
but it will have
less of an impact.

00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:17.810
Now, there's a counter to
that by the other side, which

00:37:17.810 --> 00:37:20.070
I'll talk about in a second.

00:37:20.070 --> 00:37:22.877
But if we look at the
historical context,

00:37:22.877 --> 00:37:24.710
one thing that's important
is that we're not

00:37:24.710 --> 00:37:27.890
at an unprecedented
level of CO2.

00:37:27.890 --> 00:37:29.625
We're at quite a
low level of CO2,

00:37:29.625 --> 00:37:31.250
and we're at a low
level of temperature

00:37:31.250 --> 00:37:32.670
in the history of the planet.

00:37:32.670 --> 00:37:34.336
So when people talk
about oh, the planet

00:37:34.336 --> 00:37:35.960
can't handle this
or the planet--

00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:38.510
if we had never-- if we were
at the highest point of CO2

00:37:38.510 --> 00:37:40.610
and temperature in the
history of the planet,

00:37:40.610 --> 00:37:42.860
I think that would be
more of cause for concern.

00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:44.072
It would be unprecedented.

00:37:44.072 --> 00:37:45.530
But given that
we're at a time when

00:37:45.530 --> 00:37:48.267
we're at 1/20 the
historical high of CO2

00:37:48.267 --> 00:37:49.850
and we're at a low
temperature, that's

00:37:49.850 --> 00:37:53.780
another reason why it seems odd
to just get completely bent out

00:37:53.780 --> 00:37:55.640
of shape about this.

00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:59.840
And you notice, also, there is
not a strong correlation at all

00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:02.150
between temperature and CO2.

00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:06.620
And actually, CO2
levels tend to go back.

00:38:06.620 --> 00:38:08.750
You ask on the question period.

00:38:08.750 --> 00:38:10.700
That's just some
historical context.

00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:13.040
And then if we look at,
consistent with this idea

00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:17.030
of mild warming, this is since
what's called the Little Ice

00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:18.830
Age, we've had warming
and you usually

00:38:18.830 --> 00:38:20.810
see the warming as
really big, but if you

00:38:20.810 --> 00:38:23.990
look at it on a human
scale, it's just minor.

00:38:23.990 --> 00:38:26.210
So there's such a thing
as having an impact that's

00:38:26.210 --> 00:38:28.670
not that big an impact.

00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:30.950
And it's important to
distinguish between that

00:38:30.950 --> 00:38:32.070
and runaway warming.

00:38:32.070 --> 00:38:34.700
So when people say, oh, this
is the hottest year in history,

00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:36.540
sometimes there's a
little fudging there.

00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:38.998
But if they say, this is the
hottest year in history, well,

00:38:38.998 --> 00:38:41.360
they don't really
mean history, right?

00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:44.600
They mean, OK, in the last
100 years that we've recorded.

00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:46.280
But that's not that surprising.

00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:49.280
If we were already warming
before we added CO2,

00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:52.370
and then we added
some CO2, yeah.

00:38:52.370 --> 00:38:54.330
I mean, that makes sense.

00:38:54.330 --> 00:39:00.020
I mean, if I'm gaining
1/100 of a pound a year,

00:39:00.020 --> 00:39:02.780
it could be my fattest
year on record.

00:39:02.780 --> 00:39:06.640
But it still could be
not that big of a deal.

00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:09.790
Now, the issue is, are we
having some runaway effect?

00:39:09.790 --> 00:39:12.760
And this is definitely
predicted by certain models.

00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:15.811
But it is not the same
as the greenhouse effect.

00:39:15.811 --> 00:39:18.310
These are people who say the
greenhouse effect is compounded

00:39:18.310 --> 00:39:20.890
by what are called feedbacks.

00:39:20.890 --> 00:39:26.089
And my basic response to this
is that I am not a modeler.

00:39:26.089 --> 00:39:27.880
I have a little bit of
experience modeling,

00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:29.860
but the one thing I
do know is that models

00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:31.640
have to be predicted.

00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:35.110
And so if you cannot predict
the future with your model,

00:39:35.110 --> 00:39:38.140
then I don't believe the
model or the simulation.

00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:40.960
And so the basic problem
with modern climate models

00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:44.500
is they can't predict climate,
and they systematically

00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:45.880
over-predict it.

00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:48.490
So I think that we should
encourage people to come up

00:39:48.490 --> 00:39:50.100
with better models,
but we definitely

00:39:50.100 --> 00:39:52.600
can't make decisions based on
climate prediction models that

00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:54.460
can't predict climate.

00:39:54.460 --> 00:39:57.790
Now the second effect
we have to look at

00:39:57.790 --> 00:39:59.200
is the fertilizer effect.

00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:02.675
Now, this is an effect of
CO2 that's considerably more

00:40:02.675 --> 00:40:04.300
significant than the
greenhouse effect,

00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:06.580
I think, and it's
really important

00:40:06.580 --> 00:40:08.440
because what's happened
is, because there's

00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:09.898
more CO2 in the
atmosphere, there's

00:40:09.898 --> 00:40:13.240
been global greening around the
world, including crop growth,

00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:15.216
that there otherwise
would not have been.

00:40:15.216 --> 00:40:16.840
And so if we're
considering taking away

00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:20.530
fossil fuels from people,
that's one thing to factor in.

00:40:20.530 --> 00:40:24.240
But it's also, in terms of
how we think about things,

00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:28.340
it's very important that
we're never taught about this.

00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:30.820
The US government, I think,
only about two years ago even

00:40:30.820 --> 00:40:33.700
acknowledged this, even though
it was known for decades.

00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:36.880
So it's completely
unfair to not acknowledge

00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:39.130
important impacts
of fossil fuels

00:40:39.130 --> 00:40:41.216
because they don't
serve your narrative.

00:40:41.216 --> 00:40:42.340
And that's what's happened.

00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:44.304
So if people acknowledged
all the effects

00:40:44.304 --> 00:40:45.970
and then they had
different measurements

00:40:45.970 --> 00:40:48.080
or different estimates
than I do, that's good.

00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:49.520
I mean, we can debate that.

00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:50.936
But if they won't
even acknowledge

00:40:50.936 --> 00:40:55.050
the different effects, then I
think we have a big problem.

00:40:55.050 --> 00:40:57.344
Now, you might think
one of maybe the biggest

00:40:57.344 --> 00:40:59.760
potential negative if we had
massive warming was sea level

00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:01.630
rise, but when I look
at sea level rise,

00:41:01.630 --> 00:41:03.546
if you actually look at
the best measurements,

00:41:03.546 --> 00:41:05.400
sea level is mostly
a local phenomenon.

00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:07.290
So sea level rise,
sea level fall's

00:41:07.290 --> 00:41:10.740
primarily due to local
factors, things like landmasses

00:41:10.740 --> 00:41:13.710
shrinking or lowering or rising.

00:41:13.710 --> 00:41:15.990
The overall trends are
just not that interesting,

00:41:15.990 --> 00:41:18.090
and if we put it in
historical context,

00:41:18.090 --> 00:41:22.330
our sea level rise is far, far,
far slower than our ancestors

00:41:22.330 --> 00:41:26.490
just 10,000 years ago, and we
have far, far better technology

00:41:26.490 --> 00:41:27.690
to deal with.

00:41:27.690 --> 00:41:30.300
So I think if we say there's a
high threshold for restricting

00:41:30.300 --> 00:41:34.110
fossil fuels, I don't think
that warming based on CO2

00:41:34.110 --> 00:41:36.150
even comes close to
meeting that threshold.

00:41:36.150 --> 00:41:39.780
I think we should be focused on
energy for billions of people

00:41:39.780 --> 00:41:42.030
around the world
and a lot more of it

00:41:42.030 --> 00:41:43.701
by liberating all
forms of energy,

00:41:43.701 --> 00:41:45.450
including nuclear,
including fossil fuels,

00:41:45.450 --> 00:41:49.300
including solar,
including hydro.

00:41:49.300 --> 00:41:51.700
So that's my base conclusion.

00:41:51.700 --> 00:41:53.470
If our goal is human
flourishing and if we

00:41:53.470 --> 00:41:55.540
look at the full
context, there's

00:41:55.540 --> 00:41:58.510
a strong moral case
for fossil fuels.

00:41:58.510 --> 00:42:00.400
But I do separate,
there's what's

00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:04.204
the framework we're using,
and then, what are the facts?

00:42:04.204 --> 00:42:05.620
And I've tried my
best to do both.

00:42:05.620 --> 00:42:09.460
The first one is the thing I
would most strongly argue for,

00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:11.910
and I'm interested in
any arguments against,

00:42:11.910 --> 00:42:14.650
and then the second, all I
can say is I've done my best.

00:42:14.650 --> 00:42:18.460
But all of those
measurements can be checked.

00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:19.996
And just one final
note about that,

00:42:19.996 --> 00:42:21.370
because that's
really my mission,

00:42:21.370 --> 00:42:23.440
is to get this human
flourishing based

00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:26.720
framework in the discussion.

00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:29.560
So far, my focus in
the last 10 years

00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:32.140
has been getting human
flourishing to be the guiding

00:42:32.140 --> 00:42:35.800
principle of energy progress,
but I think, and this pertains

00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:37.840
to whatever [INAUDIBLE]
does, it also

00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:41.320
needs to be the principle
of technological progress.

00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:43.540
You have a lot of
people interfacing

00:42:43.540 --> 00:42:45.050
with digital
technology, I think,

00:42:45.050 --> 00:42:47.950
who have this false
alternative of either,

00:42:47.950 --> 00:42:50.740
let's just use whatever
technology comes our way,

00:42:50.740 --> 00:42:52.896
or, this technophobia
of technology

00:42:52.896 --> 00:42:53.770
is ruining our lives.

00:42:53.770 --> 00:42:56.320
It's making us all into lab
rats and this kind of thing.

00:42:56.320 --> 00:42:58.090
And I think the
solution is we need

00:42:58.090 --> 00:43:03.130
to think of technology not as
binary good or bad, but as good

00:43:03.130 --> 00:43:07.075
when used intelligently in
pursuit of human flourishing.

00:43:07.075 --> 00:43:08.950
And I think there's a
lot of interesting work

00:43:08.950 --> 00:43:09.530
to be done there.

00:43:09.530 --> 00:43:11.050
If anyone's interested
in discussing that,

00:43:11.050 --> 00:43:11.960
feel free to email me.

00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:13.501
I'll give you my
address in a second.

00:43:13.501 --> 00:43:15.760
And then, finally, my
broadest project, next project

00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:17.590
is The Human
Flourishing Project.

00:43:17.590 --> 00:43:20.620
And the premise there is that
we need this kind of framework,

00:43:20.620 --> 00:43:22.630
this human flourishing
based framework

00:43:22.630 --> 00:43:24.010
in every area of life.

00:43:24.010 --> 00:43:25.630
We need to be really deliberate.

00:43:25.630 --> 00:43:27.860
What is the best outcome
for human beings,

00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:30.430
and how can we look
at the full context

00:43:30.430 --> 00:43:33.290
when we make any given choice?

00:43:33.290 --> 00:43:35.420
So if you want to learn
more about any of this

00:43:35.420 --> 00:43:39.610
and get on my weekly list,
you can email Google resources

00:43:39.610 --> 00:43:42.450
or you can email anything
else to alex@alexepstein.com

00:43:42.450 --> 00:43:47.439
or you can text
moralcase to 444999.

00:43:47.439 --> 00:43:50.980
Well, it's not how I expected
to be at Google, but it was fun

00:43:50.980 --> 00:43:55.291
and we have, I think, 15 minutes
for questions, so let's do it.

00:43:55.291 --> 00:44:02.442
[APPLAUSE]

00:44:02.442 --> 00:44:03.650
You have to go to that thing.

00:44:10.370 --> 00:44:12.500
AUDIENCE: Check,
yeah, is this working?

00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:14.550
First, thank you so
much for the talk.

00:44:14.550 --> 00:44:18.140
That was wonderful,
when someone presents

00:44:18.140 --> 00:44:21.100
in a concise way something
you have been thinking,

00:44:21.100 --> 00:44:22.580
so thank you so much.

00:44:22.580 --> 00:44:25.550
The question is, how do you
deal with all your acquaintances

00:44:25.550 --> 00:44:28.850
and friends who
oftentimes, nowadays,

00:44:28.850 --> 00:44:31.070
they just believe in something?

00:44:31.070 --> 00:44:35.800
They don't really want to see
that facts or think and debate.

00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:38.910
They just want to take
an opinion, take a stand,

00:44:38.910 --> 00:44:39.930
and that's it.

00:44:39.930 --> 00:44:41.720
ALEX EPSTEIN: What
would be an issue?

00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:43.760
Just so we can make it concrete.

00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:45.570
AUDIENCE: Well, about
the climate change,

00:44:45.570 --> 00:44:47.210
do you believe in
the climate change?

00:44:47.210 --> 00:44:47.630
ALEX EPSTEIN: Right.

00:44:47.630 --> 00:44:49.296
AUDIENCE: How do we
make them understand

00:44:49.296 --> 00:44:52.627
that this is the wrong question
to ask without offending them?

00:44:52.627 --> 00:44:53.960
ALEX EPSTEIN: Yes, right, right.

00:44:53.960 --> 00:44:57.312
So one thing you could do, and
I've tried this many times,

00:44:57.312 --> 00:44:59.020
so I can tell you how
it's worked for me.

00:44:59.020 --> 00:44:59.550
It doesn't.

00:44:59.550 --> 00:45:04.500
Is to say, you're thinking
about this all wrong, right?

00:45:04.500 --> 00:45:06.920
That doesn't -- especially
on dates, right?

00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:11.080
It doesn't work so well.

00:45:11.080 --> 00:45:15.989
I've been-- one of the-- if
you email me for the resources,

00:45:15.989 --> 00:45:17.530
there, I have some
resources on this.

00:45:17.530 --> 00:45:19.821
I've been studying this a
lot in the past couple years,

00:45:19.821 --> 00:45:22.640
and I call it
constructive conversation.

00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:26.850
So how do you have constructive
conversations with people?

00:45:26.850 --> 00:45:32.300
And what I found is that it all
comes down to getting people

00:45:32.300 --> 00:45:35.360
to agree to the framework--

00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:41.420
excuse me-- but
in a natural way.

00:45:41.420 --> 00:45:43.040
So even you can do--

00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:44.530
the way even I'll
do it in a talk

00:45:44.530 --> 00:45:46.660
is I'll just share
my own story and how

00:45:46.660 --> 00:45:48.220
I came to think about it.

00:45:48.220 --> 00:45:51.040
But let's say I'm in
Uber and the driver

00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:52.540
asks me, what do you do?

00:45:52.540 --> 00:45:54.040
And I say, oh, I
write about energy.

00:45:54.040 --> 00:45:55.800
And he says, oh, solar energy.

00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:57.529
This is what always happens.

00:45:57.529 --> 00:45:58.820
And I go, oh, it's interesting.

00:45:58.820 --> 00:46:01.285
I was-- my background's
in philosophy

00:46:01.285 --> 00:46:03.410
and 10 years ago, I got
really interested in energy

00:46:03.410 --> 00:46:06.850
and I wanted to know what is
really the-- if you look really

00:46:06.850 --> 00:46:09.100
carefully at the
pros and cons, what

00:46:09.100 --> 00:46:10.690
are really the best
sources of energy

00:46:10.690 --> 00:46:12.430
for people going forward.

00:46:12.430 --> 00:46:14.890
And I actually concluded
that fossil fuels were

00:46:14.890 --> 00:46:16.674
a lot better than I expected.

00:46:16.674 --> 00:46:19.090
And I actually think we should
use more of them, not less.

00:46:19.090 --> 00:46:21.100
That's what I call
an opinion story.

00:46:21.100 --> 00:46:24.970
Because nobody can disagree
that you believe it, right?

00:46:24.970 --> 00:46:26.540
They can think you're crazy.

00:46:26.540 --> 00:46:27.730
They can't disagree
that you believe it,

00:46:27.730 --> 00:46:29.813
and that's often a good
way of introducing to say,

00:46:29.813 --> 00:46:32.890
oh, I come to think
of it like this.

00:46:32.890 --> 00:46:35.380
Steve Jobs is actually
really good about this.

00:46:35.380 --> 00:46:38.170
In his public interviews,
he'll just often

00:46:38.170 --> 00:46:39.610
answer things in that--

00:46:39.610 --> 00:46:42.236
he would answer things
in that kind of way.

00:46:42.236 --> 00:46:44.110
But one way or another,
you want to get clear

00:46:44.110 --> 00:46:47.080
really early in the
discussion, whether you say it

00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:49.030
as your own story or
whether you ask them,

00:46:49.030 --> 00:46:51.550
that they're going to
look at the full context

00:46:51.550 --> 00:46:53.390
and that human beings
are the priority.

00:46:53.390 --> 00:46:56.620
So often, I'll just
say, OK, would you--

00:46:56.620 --> 00:46:59.546
whatever they say, I am
always happy to talk about it.

00:46:59.546 --> 00:47:01.920
So they're like, I want to
talk about how a human being--

00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:03.760
how fossil fuel
executives are murdering

00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:06.210
little children and Belize
or something like that.

00:47:06.210 --> 00:47:08.560
So I go, great, let's discuss
the evidence for that.

00:47:08.560 --> 00:47:10.900
Or let's say, climate
change is doing it.

00:47:10.900 --> 00:47:14.080
Say, but, just so
we're clear, would you

00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:16.120
agree that when we're
looking at fossil fuels,

00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:18.550
we have to look
carefully at both

00:47:18.550 --> 00:47:20.394
the positives and
negatives and when

00:47:20.394 --> 00:47:21.560
we look at the alternatives?

00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:23.920
So we're not just going to
look at the positives of wind

00:47:23.920 --> 00:47:25.628
and the negatives of
fossil fuels, right?

00:47:25.628 --> 00:47:27.670
That would be biased.

00:47:27.670 --> 00:47:29.940
What's fascinating
about doing that,

00:47:29.940 --> 00:47:33.100
introducing the framework
into the conversation,

00:47:33.100 --> 00:47:38.290
is that 99% of people will agree
to it, but only 1% of people

00:47:38.290 --> 00:47:40.930
will practice it left
to their own devices.

00:47:40.930 --> 00:47:44.020
So almost in no conversation
will anybody really

00:47:44.020 --> 00:47:47.140
be even handed on their own.

00:47:47.140 --> 00:47:48.250
It's very, very rare.

00:47:48.250 --> 00:47:50.806
But if you make that
method explicit,

00:47:50.806 --> 00:47:52.180
they'll be much
more even handed.

00:47:52.180 --> 00:47:54.270
And if they're not,
you can play referee.

00:47:54.270 --> 00:47:55.960
Wait, wait, wait, I thought we
were going to talk about this.

00:47:55.960 --> 00:47:57.180
You didn't mention that.

00:47:57.180 --> 00:47:59.870
And the same thing is
true about being careful,

00:47:59.870 --> 00:48:03.750
you know, the, two feet of
sea level rise versus the 20.

00:48:03.750 --> 00:48:06.580
So more in my
resources, but the idea

00:48:06.580 --> 00:48:10.100
is to naturally frame the
discussion very early on.

00:48:10.100 --> 00:48:11.890
And it's shocking
how well that works.

00:48:16.150 --> 00:48:19.710
AUDIENCE: I'm from Brazil and
I just recently moved here.

00:48:19.710 --> 00:48:23.040
And in Brazil, I used to work
with indigenous communities,

00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:25.830
basically, how we
could work with them

00:48:25.830 --> 00:48:29.970
so then they can tell exactly
what's going on on the ground.

00:48:29.970 --> 00:48:32.580
And then working for
Google, I realized

00:48:32.580 --> 00:48:38.190
that I was working towards
making them doing something

00:48:38.190 --> 00:48:39.510
that I believe.

00:48:39.510 --> 00:48:41.910
And I thought that it
was wrong, somehow,

00:48:41.910 --> 00:48:48.150
because maybe they don't
want to have energy, right?

00:48:48.150 --> 00:48:52.590
So how do you measure
what are human flourishes?

00:48:52.590 --> 00:48:56.580
How can you tell someone else
what they need, for example?

00:48:56.580 --> 00:49:00.300
Because those
ingenious communities,

00:49:00.300 --> 00:49:03.060
they just want to get
their territory protected.

00:49:03.060 --> 00:49:05.220
OK, with technology
they might be

00:49:05.220 --> 00:49:06.930
able to tell the
world that a mining

00:49:06.930 --> 00:49:11.640
company is putting their garbage
or the waste in the river.

00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:17.080
But how to work with
those people that

00:49:17.080 --> 00:49:19.660
doesn't have energy,
to let them know

00:49:19.660 --> 00:49:20.920
that they need this energy?

00:49:23.315 --> 00:49:25.440
ALEX EPSTEIN: So then
there's the indigenous people

00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:29.070
issue is, I think, a more
general issue than energy.

00:49:29.070 --> 00:49:35.280
There's a question about to
what extent is political freedom

00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:36.750
a universal value.

00:49:36.750 --> 00:49:39.300
So let's say you have
a community where

00:49:39.300 --> 00:49:41.190
there are practices
that we would regard

00:49:41.190 --> 00:49:44.842
as barbaric, different-- and
this exists in different tribes

00:49:44.842 --> 00:49:45.550
around the world.

00:49:45.550 --> 00:49:47.820
I'm not saying this
one was, but things

00:49:47.820 --> 00:49:51.590
like female genital
mutilation and honor killings

00:49:51.590 --> 00:49:53.310
and there's all sorts
of practices that

00:49:53.310 --> 00:49:55.640
occur in different populations.

00:49:55.640 --> 00:49:57.639
And there is a
real moral question

00:49:57.639 --> 00:49:59.430
of, to what extent do
we believe that there

00:49:59.430 --> 00:50:02.850
are universal values,
including freedom, including

00:50:02.850 --> 00:50:07.140
respecting the rights of both
genders, all genders, right?

00:50:07.140 --> 00:50:09.390
To what extent is that,
and to what extent

00:50:09.390 --> 00:50:11.850
do we say, any group
can do whatever

00:50:11.850 --> 00:50:13.870
it wants to the individual?

00:50:13.870 --> 00:50:17.610
So I'm definitely on the
side of I'm an individualist.

00:50:17.610 --> 00:50:18.840
I believe in freedom.

00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:21.240
I care about the people
in those communities

00:50:21.240 --> 00:50:23.860
that I think are
being oppressed.

00:50:23.860 --> 00:50:26.430
That's not my focus here,
but that's my general view

00:50:26.430 --> 00:50:27.810
on that kind of thing.

00:50:27.810 --> 00:50:30.870
And the relationship
between this and energy

00:50:30.870 --> 00:50:35.120
is that, from
everything I've seen,

00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:37.550
there are billions of
people who want more energy,

00:50:37.550 --> 00:50:38.975
and we tend to--

00:50:38.975 --> 00:50:42.974
I have a friend
who does a lot of--

00:50:42.974 --> 00:50:45.140
he has a really cool business
enabling entrepreneurs

00:50:45.140 --> 00:50:46.910
in Africa, particularly Rwanda.

00:50:46.910 --> 00:50:48.590
We just talk about
this perception

00:50:48.590 --> 00:50:51.620
that, oh, people in
Africa, they just

00:50:51.620 --> 00:50:53.870
want to run around like
stereotypical tribes

00:50:53.870 --> 00:50:56.534
and they're not interested in a
lot of the stuff that we have.

00:50:56.534 --> 00:50:57.950
But I think a lot
of stuff we have

00:50:57.950 --> 00:51:00.920
in terms of freedom and energy,
those are universal values,

00:51:00.920 --> 00:51:02.040
and people want them.

00:51:02.040 --> 00:51:05.180
So I think that the global
thing I'm dealing with

00:51:05.180 --> 00:51:08.510
is not the relatively few
people who don't want energy,

00:51:08.510 --> 00:51:11.700
but it's the people who,
do and can't afford it.

00:51:11.700 --> 00:51:15.350
And so the key there is how do
you empower them to create more

00:51:15.350 --> 00:51:17.690
wealth and how do you empower
energy producers to create

00:51:17.690 --> 00:51:20.210
as much affordable
energy as possible?

00:51:20.210 --> 00:51:22.760
Because when you make
energy more expensive,

00:51:22.760 --> 00:51:26.450
the people who are most affected
are the poorest people, not

00:51:26.450 --> 00:51:27.650
Leonardo DiCaprio.

00:51:27.650 --> 00:51:28.690
I think there was one.

00:51:28.690 --> 00:51:30.668
You wanted to go,
right, in front of him?

00:51:30.668 --> 00:51:31.709
AUDIENCE: It's all right.

00:51:31.709 --> 00:51:33.429
I can go after him.

00:51:33.429 --> 00:51:34.720
ALEX EPSTEIN: No, ladies first.

00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:35.050
Come on.

00:51:35.050 --> 00:51:35.456
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:51:35.456 --> 00:51:36.270
Thank you.

00:51:36.270 --> 00:51:38.710
ALEX EPSTEIN: At the risk
of being chauvinistic.

00:51:38.710 --> 00:51:41.130
AUDIENCE: Hi, so
I grew in China,

00:51:41.130 --> 00:51:44.500
and I really agree
with your points

00:51:44.500 --> 00:51:49.390
and it's something I've never
heard during my whole time

00:51:49.390 --> 00:51:50.680
living in China.

00:51:50.680 --> 00:51:54.310
I'm wondering have you
thought about there's

00:51:54.310 --> 00:51:59.500
some way for your framework to
impact the thinking of people

00:51:59.500 --> 00:52:02.780
in China, especially
given the internet control

00:52:02.780 --> 00:52:04.964
and stuff happening?

00:52:04.964 --> 00:52:07.570
ALEX EPSTEIN: Well, I would
love to talk to you about it.

00:52:07.570 --> 00:52:11.630
I haven't had much impact there,
and I'm very interested in it.

00:52:11.630 --> 00:52:14.800
So if you have any ideas,
even if you don't know people,

00:52:14.800 --> 00:52:19.660
but of places to try to
impact, I'll definitely do it.

00:52:19.660 --> 00:52:21.280
But I'm glad you like it.

00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:23.290
There's lots of
interesting things.

00:52:23.290 --> 00:52:25.510
There's so many interesting
things being done well

00:52:25.510 --> 00:52:27.700
and not being done
well, at the same time.

00:52:27.700 --> 00:52:31.240
So it would be really
interesting to discuss things

00:52:31.240 --> 00:52:32.920
with people there.

00:52:32.920 --> 00:52:34.190
AUDIENCE: I see.

00:52:34.190 --> 00:52:36.830
Yeah, that's good to
know because my dad works

00:52:36.830 --> 00:52:39.520
in oil in China and
their industries put

00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:42.560
out high techs and very
restrictive restrictions.

00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:44.814
Maybe I will try [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:44.814 --> 00:52:45.730
ALEX EPSTEIN: Awesome.

00:52:45.730 --> 00:52:47.460
AUDIENCE: Something
can make an impact

00:52:47.460 --> 00:52:50.190
as [INAUDIBLE] who really
cares about my people in China.

00:52:50.190 --> 00:52:51.190
ALEX EPSTEIN: Thank you.

00:52:51.190 --> 00:52:52.023
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:52:55.660 --> 00:52:56.449
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:52:56.449 --> 00:52:57.740
Thank you very much for coming.

00:52:57.740 --> 00:53:02.140
I appreciated how your
book affected my thinking.

00:53:02.140 --> 00:53:05.410
One of the things that I
think is very important

00:53:05.410 --> 00:53:08.800
is to be focused on
human flourishing,

00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:12.100
and I agree with
that central premise.

00:53:12.100 --> 00:53:15.700
And I also agree that
historically, fossil fuels

00:53:15.700 --> 00:53:20.270
have been a great driver
of human flourishing.

00:53:20.270 --> 00:53:22.630
But it seems like at
this point in time,

00:53:22.630 --> 00:53:25.180
there is a lot of scientists
that are telling us

00:53:25.180 --> 00:53:30.160
that in the net, going forward,
there are a lot of harmful side

00:53:30.160 --> 00:53:33.070
effects that the carbon
emissions are producing,

00:53:33.070 --> 00:53:34.420
are creating.

00:53:34.420 --> 00:53:38.680
So how do we know that just
because the historical trend is

00:53:38.680 --> 00:53:40.540
they've done more
good than harm,

00:53:40.540 --> 00:53:43.120
is still going to be
true going forward,

00:53:43.120 --> 00:53:45.490
in the face of all of
these scientists telling us

00:53:45.490 --> 00:53:49.360
that they're creating a great
deal of harmful side effects

00:53:49.360 --> 00:53:51.620
that we haven't
really felt much yet,

00:53:51.620 --> 00:53:53.240
but we will feel in the future?

00:53:56.530 --> 00:53:59.440
ALEX EPSTEIN: Really
important issue, generally,

00:53:59.440 --> 00:54:01.010
of how do we--

00:54:01.010 --> 00:54:04.750
what is the relationship
between expert claims

00:54:04.750 --> 00:54:06.920
and our own thinking?

00:54:06.920 --> 00:54:09.340
And I think the
two prevalent ways

00:54:09.340 --> 00:54:10.640
of dealing with this are wrong.

00:54:10.640 --> 00:54:15.730
So one is just defer to
experts or even bow to experts

00:54:15.730 --> 00:54:18.400
or meet what media tells
us experts, so the people

00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:20.770
who say, well, if
97% of scientists

00:54:20.770 --> 00:54:23.905
agree, who am I
to question that?

00:54:23.905 --> 00:54:25.030
So that's one kind of view.

00:54:25.030 --> 00:54:27.859
And the other is that
consensus doesn't matter,

00:54:27.859 --> 00:54:28.900
experts are always wrong.

00:54:28.900 --> 00:54:29.650
And that sort of--

00:54:29.650 --> 00:54:31.540
I think those are
both obviously wrong.

00:54:31.540 --> 00:54:34.270
So you need experts,
but historically, we

00:54:34.270 --> 00:54:38.170
know that experts are
extremely, extremely fallible

00:54:38.170 --> 00:54:41.850
and are often used
in very bad ways.

00:54:41.850 --> 00:54:44.320
In the field of
nutrition, for example,

00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:46.450
let's say, the government
sponsored Food Pyramid

00:54:46.450 --> 00:54:49.720
as a universal guide to food,
almost everyone agrees, OK,

00:54:49.720 --> 00:54:50.750
that was wrong.

00:54:50.750 --> 00:54:53.040
But at the time, if you go
back, now, we could say,

00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:54.623
oh, they were wrong
but we were right.

00:54:54.623 --> 00:54:56.920
But but we were them once.

00:54:56.920 --> 00:55:00.290
And in maybe one of
the worst examples

00:55:00.290 --> 00:55:06.550
is in the field of genetics,
people conflating evolution

00:55:06.550 --> 00:55:08.920
with eugenics and having
many leading thinkers

00:55:08.920 --> 00:55:11.470
and scientists in society
being in favor of things

00:55:11.470 --> 00:55:14.330
like forced sterilization
and different forms of racism

00:55:14.330 --> 00:55:14.830
and whatnot.

00:55:17.740 --> 00:55:20.410
And that was put forward
as the experts tell us.

00:55:20.410 --> 00:55:24.640
It was, I call it not global
warming but global dumbing.

00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:27.010
That was the theory, that,
oh, if you allow people

00:55:27.010 --> 00:55:29.382
to procreate without
sterilization,

00:55:29.382 --> 00:55:31.840
then all the dumb people are
going to sleep with each other

00:55:31.840 --> 00:55:33.530
and we're going to
have too dumb people.

00:55:33.530 --> 00:55:36.040
And so we need to clamp
down and the science

00:55:36.040 --> 00:55:38.350
says this is what we do.

00:55:38.350 --> 00:55:41.515
What we really need to do is
we need the proper relationship

00:55:41.515 --> 00:55:46.900
with experts, which, one basic
thing is that I describe it

00:55:46.900 --> 00:55:52.450
in the book as they should
function as advisers, not

00:55:52.450 --> 00:55:53.280
authorities.

00:55:53.280 --> 00:55:55.440
So an authority is
somebody you bow to.

00:55:55.440 --> 00:55:57.820
It has a religious connotation.

00:55:57.820 --> 00:56:02.770
An advisor is somebody who has
much more context in a given

00:56:02.770 --> 00:56:05.320
field but who gives you an
explanation, who gives you

00:56:05.320 --> 00:56:07.810
a very clear explanation
of what he knows,

00:56:07.810 --> 00:56:10.120
what he doesn't know,
what he sort of knows,

00:56:10.120 --> 00:56:12.760
what the strength
of evidence is.

00:56:12.760 --> 00:56:15.520
And that's what we really
need from the field of climate

00:56:15.520 --> 00:56:16.720
science.

00:56:16.720 --> 00:56:19.840
And unfortunately, we have
not gotten that whatsoever

00:56:19.840 --> 00:56:21.340
for various structural reasons.

00:56:21.340 --> 00:56:23.800
But whatever the reasons
are, we have not gotten that.

00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:27.640
And the whole sloppiness
issue is a huge part of it.

00:56:27.640 --> 00:56:29.650
We just have all these--
the public agencies say

00:56:29.650 --> 00:56:34.490
97% of scientists agree that,
then it's not really clear,

00:56:34.490 --> 00:56:38.290
and then you look into it
and it's, oh, it's actually

00:56:38.290 --> 00:56:41.350
that of the mild amount
of warming that we've had,

00:56:41.350 --> 00:56:42.792
we caused over 50%.

00:56:42.792 --> 00:56:44.750
And then you see, well,
how can you prove that?

00:56:44.750 --> 00:56:46.930
And they have no
mechanism of proving that.

00:56:46.930 --> 00:56:49.180
And then you look into
97%, and then it's

00:56:49.180 --> 00:56:51.020
actually not anywhere near 97%.

00:56:51.020 --> 00:56:53.620
This is-- there's a
97% section in the book

00:56:53.620 --> 00:56:55.630
about the actual data here.

00:56:55.630 --> 00:57:00.220
So this is a field
where the actual state

00:57:00.220 --> 00:57:05.430
of knowledge in the field is
systematically mis-reported.

00:57:05.430 --> 00:57:07.830
And that's one thing.

00:57:07.830 --> 00:57:09.675
And then another thing
is, so how accurately

00:57:09.675 --> 00:57:12.420
is it reporting things badly?

00:57:12.420 --> 00:57:15.510
And then the other thing
is, how much do they know?

00:57:15.510 --> 00:57:17.910
So one question is how
much-- every field has

00:57:17.910 --> 00:57:19.990
a different degree of maturity.

00:57:19.990 --> 00:57:23.740
So physicists applying
laws of mechanics,

00:57:23.740 --> 00:57:28.770
or, let's say, applying
quantum electrodynamics have

00:57:28.770 --> 00:57:31.200
huge amounts of
precision at making

00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:33.060
lots and lots of predictions.

00:57:33.060 --> 00:57:37.590
Climate modelers have
no success whatsoever.

00:57:37.590 --> 00:57:40.940
That's not to demean
them as human beings.

00:57:40.940 --> 00:57:44.610
It's just they're not there,
just like economic modelers,

00:57:44.610 --> 00:57:46.800
generally, have
very poor records.

00:57:46.800 --> 00:57:49.120
So we need this
objectivity from fields

00:57:49.120 --> 00:57:51.360
to know how developed
a field is this,

00:57:51.360 --> 00:57:54.370
and what is the best of
what they can tell us?

00:57:54.370 --> 00:57:57.457
And so when you hear
when they don't do that,

00:57:57.457 --> 00:57:59.040
it's very, very hard
to operate, which

00:57:59.040 --> 00:58:00.510
is why I spent a lot of time--

00:58:00.510 --> 00:58:02.760
so you're basically saying,
well, all these scientists

00:58:02.760 --> 00:58:03.454
say this.

00:58:03.454 --> 00:58:04.620
How can you say differently?

00:58:04.620 --> 00:58:06.230
And I'm saying, well,
I looked into it,

00:58:06.230 --> 00:58:08.521
and I don't think that they
say that, and to the extent

00:58:08.521 --> 00:58:11.230
they say that, they
can't prove that.

00:58:11.230 --> 00:58:14.560
So I think people need to
look into it for themselves.

00:58:14.560 --> 00:58:17.640
But one giveaway
in your question

00:58:17.640 --> 00:58:20.650
is that these scientists
say that it's harmful.

00:58:20.650 --> 00:58:21.960
So harmful is an--

00:58:21.960 --> 00:58:24.420
harmful of any
environmental factor

00:58:24.420 --> 00:58:26.790
is always going to be a
combination of environment

00:58:26.790 --> 00:58:28.300
and technology, right?

00:58:28.300 --> 00:58:31.560
So a harmful storm
200 years ago could

00:58:31.560 --> 00:58:34.470
be a romantic setting
today, because

00:58:34.470 --> 00:58:36.220
of the state of technology.

00:58:36.220 --> 00:58:36.720
Right?

00:58:36.720 --> 00:58:41.010
A harmful storm then can be
just a nice rainfall now.

00:58:41.010 --> 00:58:45.090
There's just no-- so as soon as
they start talking about harm,

00:58:45.090 --> 00:58:46.830
and then they start
talking about policy,

00:58:46.830 --> 00:58:50.460
that shows that they are out
there overstepping their field

00:58:50.460 --> 00:58:53.370
and they don't even know nearly
enough about their field.

00:58:53.370 --> 00:58:56.790
So experts as advisors,
not authorities,

00:58:56.790 --> 00:58:59.700
and I know you said you
read the book, so I--

00:58:59.700 --> 00:59:03.115
but I guess I can
say, read it again.

00:59:03.115 --> 00:59:06.624
[LAUGHTER]

00:59:06.624 --> 00:59:07.665
Yeah, there copies there.

00:59:07.665 --> 00:59:09.070
Are you giving those out
or are you selling them?

00:59:09.070 --> 00:59:10.153
AUDIENCE: Giving them out.

00:59:10.153 --> 00:59:13.110
ALEX EPSTEIN: Wow,
look at this guy.

00:59:13.110 --> 00:59:15.490
AUDIENCE: Thank you
for your work, Alex.

00:59:15.490 --> 00:59:17.050
I'm an energy engineer.

00:59:17.050 --> 00:59:19.270
I work in energy innovation.

00:59:19.270 --> 00:59:22.210
I want to build a little bit on
your last answer, in that we're

00:59:22.210 --> 00:59:23.782
in a place of great innovation.

00:59:23.782 --> 00:59:25.490
And I want to put a
little context to you

00:59:25.490 --> 00:59:28.390
and pose a problem that I
was recently introduced to.

00:59:28.390 --> 00:59:31.270
So our lieutenant
governor recently

00:59:31.270 --> 00:59:33.770
posed a problem, a
challenge, actually,

00:59:33.770 --> 00:59:34.990
to the power industry.

00:59:34.990 --> 00:59:37.570
So we have a problem
in California

00:59:37.570 --> 00:59:41.140
that renewable power is
around $0.15 a kilowatt hour.

00:59:41.140 --> 00:59:43.870
Fossil power is around
$0.02 a kilowatt hour.

00:59:43.870 --> 00:59:47.530
The problem we posed was, we
have a poverty rate of about

00:59:47.530 --> 00:59:50.459
high 30% in California.

00:59:50.459 --> 00:59:52.000
Lieutenant governor
placed some blame

00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:54.310
on that on the energy industry.

00:59:54.310 --> 00:59:56.770
Obviously, that poverty
rate with cost of living

00:59:56.770 --> 00:59:58.480
is, or, at least,
many people fall

00:59:58.480 --> 01:00:00.536
into that category in
this room, with the cost

01:00:00.536 --> 01:00:01.660
of living in Mountain View.

01:00:01.660 --> 01:00:04.780
But the challenge would
be how many people

01:00:04.780 --> 01:00:07.840
out of 30 plus percent
of Californians, maybe

01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:12.280
10 million plus Californians,
by changing energy policies

01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:14.874
and adjusting
policies, et cetera,

01:00:14.874 --> 01:00:17.290
and getting rates down, how
many of those 10 million could

01:00:17.290 --> 01:00:21.170
you lift out of, would
you say, poverty?

01:00:21.170 --> 01:00:23.300
ALEX EPSTEIN: I think it'd
be hard to say, exactly,

01:00:23.300 --> 01:00:26.900
even for somebody whose
focus was being a number

01:00:26.900 --> 01:00:29.450
cruncher in that way, which
mine isn't, although I'm

01:00:29.450 --> 01:00:32.660
pretty good at telling
whether they're BS-ing or not,

01:00:32.660 --> 01:00:34.410
which is a lot of the time.

01:00:34.410 --> 01:00:37.850
But the mechanism of energy
being the industry that powers

01:00:37.850 --> 01:00:41.180
every other industry and
energy being a cost that

01:00:41.180 --> 01:00:45.320
exists and gets passed on
through everything else,

01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:46.280
that's just a fact.

01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:49.160
I mean, there's nothing
really to say about that

01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:50.360
except that's a fact.

01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:53.000
So if you can dramatically
decrease that,

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.130
then it has all sorts
of positive impacts

01:00:55.130 --> 01:00:57.680
for local industry, which
will mean a lot more,

01:00:57.680 --> 01:01:00.860
all things being equal, a lot
more jobs for people and power

01:01:00.860 --> 01:01:01.610
costs.

01:01:01.610 --> 01:01:04.460
So the idea of energy poverty,
I don't know the energy poverty

01:01:04.460 --> 01:01:07.730
numbers for California, but I'm
sure they're high for the US.

01:01:07.730 --> 01:01:09.440
Usually people and
people in poverty

01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:12.140
are spending 10 plus
percent of their income

01:01:12.140 --> 01:01:14.690
on energy, which is a
very significant thing.

01:01:14.690 --> 01:01:18.300
One of my-- my main
researcher lives in Germany

01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:23.650
and he just tells me that they
have this term, energy poverty,

01:01:23.650 --> 01:01:27.280
that's come into common use
since solar and wind started

01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:29.950
becoming massively subsidized.

01:01:29.950 --> 01:01:32.560
And people have a lot more
trouble paying their bills,

01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:34.600
fewer people are
paying their bills.

01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:38.650
So it makes this difference.

01:01:38.650 --> 01:01:41.950
It will make a
direct difference,

01:01:41.950 --> 01:01:44.380
but the longer term
difference is even harder

01:01:44.380 --> 01:01:48.160
because of all the productivity
and job opportunity it creates.

01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:52.030
But I'll also say that many
of the same anti-freedom ideas

01:01:52.030 --> 01:01:54.190
that are infecting
energy in California

01:01:54.190 --> 01:01:56.960
are infecting the
rest of our policy.

01:01:56.960 --> 01:02:01.850
So I think we just have this
incredible thing in California

01:02:01.850 --> 01:02:04.400
where we've got this
amazing innovation

01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:09.640
and we have software,
digital technology industry

01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:13.900
that, because it's not
super, super physical, in so

01:02:13.900 --> 01:02:18.220
many ways, is not subject
to modern environmentalism

01:02:18.220 --> 01:02:20.200
and anti-development policies.

01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:23.540
And so it's been able to
proliferate and be amazing.

01:02:23.540 --> 01:02:25.270
But then we inflict--

01:02:25.270 --> 01:02:27.070
many of the people
in this industry

01:02:27.070 --> 01:02:29.830
inflict anti-development
policies

01:02:29.830 --> 01:02:32.502
on poor people in this
country and around the world.

01:02:32.502 --> 01:02:34.210
And I think a lot of
people in California

01:02:34.210 --> 01:02:36.126
have contempt for
that and I think

01:02:36.126 --> 01:02:37.930
they have contempt
for the water policies

01:02:37.930 --> 01:02:40.060
and for us dumping
water into the ocean

01:02:40.060 --> 01:02:45.170
because a form of fish that came
into existence 30 years ago.

01:02:45.170 --> 01:02:47.950
And I think, in
general, we should

01:02:47.950 --> 01:02:51.310
think a lot more about that
30% of people, particularly

01:02:51.310 --> 01:02:53.643
if we're victimizing them,
which I think we are.

01:02:58.850 --> 01:02:59.550
All right.

01:02:59.550 --> 01:03:00.120
It's a wrap.

01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:02.130
I'll be here if anyone wants to
chat, but thank you very much.

01:03:02.130 --> 01:03:02.850
It was fun.

01:03:02.850 --> 01:03:04.700
[APPLAUSE]
