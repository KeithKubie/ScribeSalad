00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:06.189
Since its establishment 

00:00:06.189 --> 00:00:08.429
CC Intelligence Technology has been committed

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.249
to shaping an efficient, interconnected

00:00:10.249 --> 00:00:12.649
and trusted commercial world, using technology

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:17.649
Hi, I’m Lei Xiaopei

00:00:17.649 --> 00:00:19.989
head of the CamScanner development team

00:00:19.989 --> 00:00:22.659
CC is a unicorn enterprise specialized in AI and big data

00:00:22.659 --> 00:00:23.829
focusing on text recognition and interpretation

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:25.709
for robotic vision and commercial big data

00:00:25.709 --> 00:00:29.629
Camscanner is one of our flagship products

00:00:29.629 --> 00:00:32.119
With nearly 400 million users worldwide

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:34.099
it is one of the most downloaded text

00:00:34.099 --> 00:00:35.609
and image management apps in the world

00:00:35.609 --> 00:00:39.759
Camscanner turns smartphones and tablets into portable scanners

00:00:39.759 --> 00:00:42.449
fax machines, and file libraries

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:45.239
Leveraging the tools and platforms provided by Google

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.069
CamScanner has achieved great success

00:00:52.679 --> 00:00:53.639
I am Wu Zhongze

00:00:53.639 --> 00:00:55.789
a development engineer at CamScanner

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:58.609
We started adapting to Android 9 very early

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:00.349
We removed the network library

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:02.469
used by some 3rd party SDKs to reference Apache

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:05.249
tested and adapted the latest power management capability

00:01:05.249 --> 00:01:06.989
and the limits for non-SDK interfaces

00:01:06.989 --> 00:01:08.769
as well as adapted the common limits of the app

00:01:08.769 --> 00:01:10.969
for back-end services and the authorization request

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:12.089
for front-end services

00:01:12.089 --> 00:01:13.699
We have fully adopted functions

00:01:13.699 --> 00:01:15.149
that create a better customer experience

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:18.239
such as notification enhancement and notch-in screen form factors.

00:01:18.239 --> 00:01:20.599
Android Jetpack provides developers like us

00:01:20.599 --> 00:01:22.159
with rich development components

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:23.879
and improves our development efficiency

00:01:23.879 --> 00:01:26.289
The “permissions” component of Jetpack adapts

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:29.579
well to the authorization configuration for various smartphone brands

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.829
thus we avoid having to make specific adaptations

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:36.039
I’m Bu Lingzhuang

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:37.949
a development engineer at CamScanner

00:01:37.949 --> 00:01:40.439
Our intention is to develop a versatile

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:41.759
easy-to-use, and efficient app

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.339
so versatility is a constant focus for us

00:01:44.339 --> 00:01:47.629
Google supports soft-decoding of HEIF static images

00:01:47.629 --> 00:01:50.369
in Android O MR1 and in the latest Android Pie

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.019
This capability is upgraded to support soft-encoding

00:01:53.019 --> 00:01:54.969
and decoding of HEIF

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:57.886
HEIF as a new format is in many ways superior to older formats

00:01:57.886 --> 00:02:01.906
advantages include smaller storage space requirement

00:02:01.906 --> 00:02:04.016
dynamic image support, and transparency support

00:02:04.016 --> 00:02:05.746
We have updated the app

00:02:05.746 --> 00:02:07.456
to support importing HEIF format images

00:02:07.456 --> 00:02:09.206
and the user experience so far has been positive

00:02:09.206 --> 00:02:12.206
We also plan to add export capability into version 9.0

00:02:12.206 --> 00:02:14.826
in future scheduled app updates

00:02:14.826 --> 00:02:16.836
to fully leverage the new features in the latest operating system

00:02:16.836 --> 00:02:18.316
and create more appealing systems

00:02:18.316 --> 00:02:19.406
and software experience environments

00:02:19.836 --> 00:02:22.106
We envision a future in which we can be the smartest

00:02:22.106 --> 00:02:23.616
and most credible commercial platform in the world

00:02:23.616 --> 00:02:25.966
Driven by new technologies from Google

00:02:25.966 --> 00:02:28.706
we expect to provide more efficient and intelligent user experiences

00:02:28.706 --> 00:02:30.166
while creating value for our customers

00:02:30.166 --> 00:02:32.016
and driving exponential business growth

00:02:32.016 --> 00:02:33.331
with our unrelenting commitment
