00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.610
Let's at the Joe Rogan experience.

2
00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:04.560
<v 1>So you have these fucks them sorts of roles,</v>

3
00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:07.680
lights on your head or just to help you navigate through the woods and to spot

4
00:00:07.681 --> 00:00:10.680
predators.
Because of course,
if you're vulnerable,
you know,

5
00:00:10.681 --> 00:00:14.580
and you see giant eyes ahead that are nine feet off the ground,
you're like,

6
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.350
oh fuck,
it's a bear.

7
00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.280
<v 0>Is she a two way street in?
It's like,
oh,
done the hun.
Yeah,</v>

8
00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:22.080
that happens.

9
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.220
<v 1>I've had experiences where I've ran into predators in the wild,
uh,
particularly,</v>

10
00:00:26.221 --> 00:00:30.190
uh,
one time in Canada.
I ran into a grizzly bear and looking in the eyes,

11
00:00:30.191 --> 00:00:33.120
and it wasn't even a big one.
It was like a six foot bear.
Wasn't huge,

12
00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.960
but it looks right through you.
It looks right to you and say,

13
00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.910
when you run into an animal that's killing shit every day and it looks at you,

14
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.450
there's,
I got demonic looking its eyes.
It's,
I've mean,

15
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.210
I've seen black bears before.
You don't see that look.
A grizzly bear,
which is,

16
00:00:48.211 --> 00:00:51.090
you know,
more predatory.
They have a crazy look in her eyes.

17
00:00:51.091 --> 00:00:52.290
It's really interesting.

18
00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.420
<v 0>I made eye contact with a couple of predators shock once in a shark cage on like</v>

19
00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:59.590
when I was doing that film,

20
00:00:59.591 --> 00:01:04.020
Sarah Marshall that 10 years ago or went in a shark cage and right and they

21
00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.390
lower you down and you see a shape a shark come towards it.

22
00:01:06.391 --> 00:01:08.140
It's like lucky swimming through time.

23
00:01:08.141 --> 00:01:11.770
It's like it's come from Navair it looks at you.
We'd like you think,
Oh fuck,

24
00:01:11.771 --> 00:01:14.870
you know,
and like,
and I was terrified in that cage.
And like,

25
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.690
like Ed Norton was there and were the Olson,
they were on that island as well.

26
00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.260
They were mates with people that are in the movie.

27
00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.690
They go in the water outside of the cage.

28
00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.180
Other other fucking mind that seems sane isn't it?

29
00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.670
The shock was lit or and apparently is not a kind of shark that eats you,

30
00:01:27.671 --> 00:01:30.970
but even the eye contact and it's fucking teeth.
I don't even look at it.

31
00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:36.270
And then another thing I looked at once I was in a tiger sanctuary in India and

32
00:01:36.461 --> 00:01:40.150
I like,
I didn't like the vehicle.
I was in a,
this is a,
I should,

33
00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.020
I should have made clear that actually cause I ain't comfortable,

34
00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:45.640
there's a better cheap over there.

35
00:01:45.641 --> 00:01:48.340
So I got out of it to transition and my mate goes,

36
00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.340
you more to get in a car in their mind it's fucking tiger over there.

37
00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.460
And there was a tiger like only 10 foot away.
Uh,

38
00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.330
might maybe I'm exaggerating.
Hold up 20 foot maximum.

39
00:01:58.331 --> 00:02:00.790
Like if it was near and the way that that thing look,

40
00:02:00.791 --> 00:02:03.310
I mean cause it's so beautiful as well.

41
00:02:03.311 --> 00:02:07.930
The intensity of being looked at by that fucking creature have some powerful

42
00:02:07.931 --> 00:02:09.970
shit you don't want eye contact without,

43
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.100
I don't want to look at something that's got like that.

44
00:02:12.101 --> 00:02:14.050
You can't negotiate with the ICAN.

45
00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.940
I feel like he'd look at me even with the Jujitsu,

46
00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.480
like I've got that little moment where I go,
hey,
come on this Elle Russ.
Yeah,

47
00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.710
we have a tiger.
He doesn't care about your mortgage.
Yeah,
neither does that.

48
00:02:23.711 --> 00:02:26.290
Grizzly bear doesn't care.
They look through your kids.

49
00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.420
<v 1>Yeah.
They don't care.
No,
but that's all it's doing all day long.</v>

50
00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:31.020
It was killing me.

51
00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.900
<v 0>It's unbelievable.
Cause that's as true as everything we reflect on it.</v>

52
00:02:34.901 --> 00:02:37.710
Just to ask,
who gives a shit about your theories?
Don't

53
00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:38.820
<v 1>know what that is.</v>

54
00:02:38.821 --> 00:02:43.380
So their idea of what the wild is is really based on two things.
One,

55
00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:48.180
their their actual love of animals.
They know,
right?
It's like dogs and cats.

56
00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.870
So the animals that we know we,
we,
we have this connection with them.

57
00:02:51.871 --> 00:02:55.770
So we think that the,
these are animals.
There's science projects,
man.

58
00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.100
Those are not animals.
Real animals don't give a fuck about you.
They,
they,

59
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.180
they are in either indifferent to you or they're scared of you or they want to

60
00:03:04.181 --> 00:03:05.890
eat you.
That's real animals.

61
00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.460
The relationship that you have with a dog is like a child.

62
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.840
Like my dog is more like a child to me than he is like an animal.

63
00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.610
I mean he's like my little friend that doesn't get to speak.
He doesn't talk.

64
00:03:18.611 --> 00:03:19.444
But you know,

65
00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.970
an animal in the wild is a competing organism.

66
00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.420
They're competing amongst all the various organisms in whatever ecosystem

67
00:03:28.421 --> 00:03:29.020
they're in.

68
00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:32.440
And either they're at the top or if they're there somewhere below that.

69
00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.970
And that's just how it goes in every deer is looking around cause there's cats

70
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.510
and the cats are slowly sneaking up on them every fucking day of the week.

71
00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.670
And if you go in a place where there's deer,

72
00:03:42.671 --> 00:03:44.890
you best believe there's going to be mountain lions there.

73
00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:49.330
Cause that's how it operates.
And when you see that in the why,
it's so rare.

74
00:03:49.331 --> 00:03:51.910
It's so rare to be around that.
But when you see that in the wild,

75
00:03:51.911 --> 00:03:54.670
then you get a deeper understanding of what it means to be an animal.

76
00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.520
What's horrific is factory farming.

77
00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.230
What's perverse and disgusting is the way animals are treated when these lives,

78
00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:07.240
these livestock companies pump these animals in these warehouses and make them

79
00:04:07.241 --> 00:04:10.480
stand in their own shit all day and then abuse them.

80
00:04:10.481 --> 00:04:12.550
And the horrific nature in which they're raising.
Yeah.

81
00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.310
All that should be illegal ag gag laws.

82
00:04:15.311 --> 00:04:18.880
Those laws were whistleblowers get arrested.
Those should be illegal.

83
00:04:18.881 --> 00:04:19.870
Those are immoral.

84
00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:24.340
They're letting people know what goes into your food and those people are being

85
00:04:24.341 --> 00:04:26.300
punished for that.
All that shit is crazy.

86
00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.780
They're being punished because it hurts business.
Yes.

87
00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.460
Well it should fucking hurt business.

88
00:04:30.461 --> 00:04:35.410
You're doing something that we all think is a moral,
that's how I feel about it.

89
00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.080
I don't think there's anything wrong with,
even if they,
if,

90
00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:42.250
if there should be standards and how cows are raised,
how chickens are raised,

91
00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.010
let him live like actual cows.
That's beautiful.

92
00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:49.720
And there's a way that they can do that where people like Chris Pratt from

93
00:04:49.721 --> 00:04:51.760
guardians get great guy.
He has,

94
00:04:51.761 --> 00:04:56.761
he raises sheep and he eats them and he even gives them out to people.

95
00:04:57.131 --> 00:05:01.000
He has butchers that take care of it.
These sheep are treated like,

96
00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.200
like they're loved,

97
00:05:02.201 --> 00:05:06.760
they're not scared of people and then literally they get walked into this room.

98
00:05:06.761 --> 00:05:07.990
They have no idea what's going to happen.

99
00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.990
A bolt gets put on the top of their head,
Bang and the lights go out.

100
00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:15.220
Now you could say that should never happen and those sheep should just live

101
00:05:15.221 --> 00:05:19.840
forever.
Okay.
You could,
I can understand that argument.
Or You could say,

102
00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.100
boy,
if you're going to eat meat and you're going to eat the meat of an animal,

103
00:05:24.101 --> 00:05:28.210
that you know how it lived and there was no horrific moments in his life.

104
00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.180
It just one day the lights went out.
That seems like the best,

105
00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:35.230
most ethical way to do it.
Maybe even perhaps more ethical than hunting.
Yes.

106
00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:40.450
Cause when I'm hunting an animal,
um,
it's,
you know,
it's out there in,

107
00:05:40.451 --> 00:05:43.870
this is crazy state where it's always looking to get eaten.

108
00:05:43.871 --> 00:05:47.140
These sheep have no idea that can be done.
They think that everybody's there,

109
00:05:47.141 --> 00:05:51.820
buddy,
and then one day they die.
Yeah,
man,
I agree with that.
You know?

110
00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:55.630
Yeah.
It's difficult to bring ethics to that.

111
00:05:55.631 --> 00:05:58.060
That's clearly in my view,
a matter

112
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:01.840
<v 0>of opinion.
Some people think that's okay,
but some people say the,</v>

113
00:06:01.841 --> 00:06:03.140
the turned around on me and say,

114
00:06:03.141 --> 00:06:06.530
you could do that same like thought experiment with people.
Like,

115
00:06:06.531 --> 00:06:08.390
why don't you just see people want like,
hey,

116
00:06:08.391 --> 00:06:09.620
the person that had the perfect life,

117
00:06:09.621 --> 00:06:12.110
he put a bolt in the top of their head and bang,
shut the lights out,

118
00:06:12.111 --> 00:06:14.180
and then they turn into barbecue.
Look at,
yeah,

119
00:06:14.181 --> 00:06:17.210
that's a very pronounced and vivid way.
But I would say that in a sense,

120
00:06:17.211 --> 00:06:20.660
we're all like,
we're being commodified,
imprisoned in clothes.

121
00:06:20.661 --> 00:06:24.750
He might like the very fact that a law has been made to prevent people regulate

122
00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:27.440
in or revealing the truth around that.
Revealing it,

123
00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:30.740
showing shows where the true bias of this system is.
Yeah.
