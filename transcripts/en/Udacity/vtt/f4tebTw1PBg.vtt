00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.220
So now we know that height is strongly heritable.

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:05.760
&gt;&gt; So, are you saying that there's a height gene?

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.630
&gt;&gt; Well, not exactly a single height gene.

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:10.090
The heritability values don't tell us about the

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:11.870
number or type of genes involved in a

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.420
given trait. Heritability values don't exactly tell us about

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.320
the genetic differences that could be contributing to

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.500
the trait themselves. For example, we don't know if

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.810
we're looking for a missense mutation, or nonsense

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:26.350
mutation, or chromosomal translocation some place in the genome.

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:28.720
&gt;&gt; So why should somebody still care about heritability?

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.430
&gt;&gt; Well, heritability can tell us if genetic factors

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.120
are involved at all, and actually might even be able

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.790
to tell us how easy it would be to

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.140
find out what those genetic factors are. For example, a

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.270
heritability close to one would signify that there are

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.480
probably a few genes responsible for the variability in the

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.990
trait, and that they have a strong influence This means

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.540
that we'd be able to perhaps find out what they

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.350
are even in a relatively small study

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.370
size. But the lower the heritability, the farther

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.010
away from one we get and the closer to zero, the more likely it is that

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.110
there are many genes that have an effect,

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.040
each with a smaller influence overall. And it

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.680
would take a much larger study size to

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.580
find the effects of those particular genetic factors.
