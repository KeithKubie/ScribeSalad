(electronic music)

00:00:31.484 --> 00:00:33.942
- Welcome to A Conversation With History,

00:00:33.942 --> 00:00:35.454
I'm Harry Kreisler

00:00:35.454 --> 00:00:38.403
of the Institute of International Studies.

00:00:38.403 --> 00:00:41.808
Our guest today is
Arlie Russell Hochschild

00:00:41.808 --> 00:00:44.502
who is one of the most
influential sociologists

00:00:44.502 --> 00:00:46.788
of her generation.

00:00:46.788 --> 00:00:48.239
She is the author of nine books,

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.072
including The Second Shift, The Time Bomb,

00:00:51.072 --> 00:00:54.299
The Managed Heart and the Outsourced Self.

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:56.389
Three of her books have been named

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:59.032
as New York Times notable
books of the year,

00:00:59.032 --> 00:01:02.322
and her work appears in 16 languages.

00:01:02.322 --> 00:01:04.642
The winner of the Ulysses medal

00:01:04.642 --> 00:01:08.336
as well as Guggenheim and Mellon Grants,

00:01:08.336 --> 00:01:10.562
she lives in Berkeley, California.

00:01:10.562 --> 00:01:13.560
She has been a professor in Berkeley's

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.227
Sociology Department since 1971,

00:01:17.879 --> 00:01:21.629
and is now a professor
in the graduate school

00:01:22.612 --> 00:01:23.612
at Berkeley.

00:01:24.982 --> 00:01:27.121
She was recognized by

00:01:27.121 --> 00:01:30.418
the American Sociological Association

00:01:30.418 --> 00:01:34.528
as one of the most
imaginative and productive

00:01:34.528 --> 00:01:38.111
feminist sociologists
in the United States.

00:01:39.172 --> 00:01:43.259
As a scholar she has been at the forefront

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.715
of research on contemporary
work and family life

00:01:45.715 --> 00:01:47.215
for over 30 years.

00:01:48.065 --> 00:01:52.065
Arlie's new book is
Strangers In Their Own Land,

00:01:53.708 --> 00:01:57.144
Anger and Mourning on the American Right,

00:01:57.144 --> 00:02:01.061
a journey to the heart
of our political divide.

00:02:01.928 --> 00:02:04.428
Arlie, welcome to our program.

00:02:05.388 --> 00:02:06.985
- Thank you very much.

00:02:06.985 --> 00:02:09.265
- Where were you born and raised?

00:02:09.265 --> 00:02:13.003
- Well, let's see, I was born
in Boston, Massachusetts,

00:02:13.003 --> 00:02:16.045
and raised in the suburbs of Washington DC

00:02:16.045 --> 00:02:17.508
until I was 12.

00:02:17.508 --> 00:02:19.923
And then my dad was in
the Foreign Service,

00:02:19.923 --> 00:02:22.686
so I lived in a bunch of countries.

00:02:22.686 --> 00:02:24.799
- And looking back, how
do you think your parents

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:27.934
shaped your thinking about the world,

00:02:27.934 --> 00:02:31.678
and in your case, more important in a way,

00:02:31.678 --> 00:02:34.372
how to deal with people?

00:02:34.372 --> 00:02:37.122
- Well, following my dad's career

00:02:38.457 --> 00:02:41.707
led me to a lot of different situations

00:02:42.684 --> 00:02:45.726
where I didn't speak the language,

00:02:45.726 --> 00:02:47.744
I didn't look like other people,

00:02:47.744 --> 00:02:49.789
I was wearing the wrong clothes.

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:53.122
I was kind of the outsider, the oddball.

00:02:54.294 --> 00:02:57.794
And yet I had social support in that role,

00:02:59.147 --> 00:03:02.375
and I think it's why I'm
a sociologist, honestly.

00:03:02.375 --> 00:03:05.068
I had to figure it out.

00:03:05.068 --> 00:03:07.692
- I have the sense that as a young person

00:03:07.692 --> 00:03:12.011
you were at some of
the teas and receptions

00:03:12.011 --> 00:03:15.750
and could watch these different people.

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.096
- That's right.

00:03:17.096 --> 00:03:18.741
I was the little kid passing the peanuts

00:03:18.741 --> 00:03:23.110
and kind of watching how
people were interacting,

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:25.781
and people from different worlds,

00:03:25.781 --> 00:03:28.544
how they were relating to each other,

00:03:28.544 --> 00:03:30.494
the different signal systems.

00:03:30.494 --> 00:03:34.030
Yeah, I watched from below, you could say.

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.464
- But listening, all the time listening.

00:03:36.464 --> 00:03:38.464
Where were you educated?

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.357
- I went to Swarthmore
College in Pennsylvania,

00:03:45.776 --> 00:03:49.564
and then came out to
Berkeley for my graduate work

00:03:49.564 --> 00:03:50.678
in sociology.

00:03:50.678 --> 00:03:54.860
- And any particular scholars
influence you greatly

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.435
in your choice of sociology as a field?

00:03:58.435 --> 00:04:00.061
- Well, yes.

00:04:00.061 --> 00:04:00.894
Actually,

00:04:02.505 --> 00:04:06.266
as an undergraduate I
had read David Riesman's

00:04:06.266 --> 00:04:09.721
The Lonely Crowd, and thought wow.

00:04:09.721 --> 00:04:13.186
You get to really do the same thing,

00:04:13.186 --> 00:04:16.017
look from underneath,
and look at the logics

00:04:16.017 --> 00:04:19.037
that might be hidden in the kind of selves

00:04:19.037 --> 00:04:21.120
that we take for granted.

00:04:22.474 --> 00:04:25.144
But coming to Berkeley,

00:04:25.144 --> 00:04:28.251
this was the best department in the world.

00:04:28.251 --> 00:04:31.918
And we had Niel Smelser,
who was my advisor,

00:04:33.827 --> 00:04:37.660
and an extraordinary
support to me in my work.

00:04:41.003 --> 00:04:42.586
And Erving Goffman.

00:04:44.671 --> 00:04:47.254
And there was Reinhardt Bendix.

00:04:49.149 --> 00:04:51.359
- So the greatest of the great.

00:04:51.359 --> 00:04:53.705
- Yeah, so I thought wow,

00:04:53.705 --> 00:04:55.999
this was exactly where I wanna be.

00:04:55.999 --> 00:04:58.302
- And what did you do
your dissertation on?

00:04:58.302 --> 00:05:02.643
- Well, my dissertation
was on the elderly.

00:05:02.643 --> 00:05:04.637
That was before, (laughing)

00:05:04.637 --> 00:05:08.078
that seemed like a foreign land, you know.

00:05:08.078 --> 00:05:12.245
And it became a book called
The Unexpected Community.

00:05:14.621 --> 00:05:16.692
And I went in thinking whoa,

00:05:16.692 --> 00:05:18.686
we've had segregation by race,

00:05:18.686 --> 00:05:23.008
but this is segregation by
age, and this is a problem.

00:05:23.008 --> 00:05:27.175
And I got a job as a
recreation director's assistant

00:05:28.186 --> 00:05:32.353
in a low-income housing
project in San Pablo here.

00:05:34.918 --> 00:05:36.894
So again, I was sort of starting micro,

00:05:36.894 --> 00:05:38.399
having a good look close up,

00:05:38.399 --> 00:05:41.304
but asking a larger question of

00:05:41.304 --> 00:05:42.949
does this work or not?

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:46.414
And what I discovered is
that the people I talked to

00:05:46.414 --> 00:05:48.806
who were generally Oakies and Arkies

00:05:48.806 --> 00:05:52.223
who had come out to work in the shipyards

00:05:53.769 --> 00:05:56.759
during World War II, extraordinary people.

00:05:56.759 --> 00:05:59.926
Many were women who would bake muffins

00:06:03.823 --> 00:06:08.049
for three dozen, and then
hand them out to others.

00:06:08.049 --> 00:06:10.445
They liked this arrangement.

00:06:10.445 --> 00:06:12.745
They had close bonds with their family,

00:06:12.745 --> 00:06:15.764
but they liked the community.

00:06:15.764 --> 00:06:17.478
And they didn't think they were old.

00:06:17.478 --> 00:06:20.013
Why they had a three-piece
band that played for

00:06:20.013 --> 00:06:23.189
the old folks in nursing homes.

00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:26.689
You know, washboard bass, and very lively.

00:06:27.767 --> 00:06:31.600
And at that time there
was a well-known theory

00:06:33.452 --> 00:06:36.198
of disengagement, Cumming and Henry.

00:06:36.198 --> 00:06:37.846
So my thesis said wait a minute,

00:06:37.846 --> 00:06:40.911
this theory of disengagement --

00:06:40.911 --> 00:06:42.048
- From your subjects.

00:06:42.048 --> 00:06:44.255
- From my subjects, right.

00:06:44.255 --> 00:06:47.343
Well the theory said that as you get older

00:06:47.343 --> 00:06:49.433
you disengage socially.

00:06:49.433 --> 00:06:51.871
But every day I was going to
do participant observation

00:06:51.871 --> 00:06:56.189
with a group who were
anything but disengaged.

00:06:56.189 --> 00:06:58.442
In fact, living together
they were more engaged

00:06:58.442 --> 00:07:02.111
than they had been ten years earlier.

00:07:02.111 --> 00:07:05.617
So I was looking at the
sociology of engagement,

00:07:05.617 --> 00:07:08.938
and saying that theory
really needs to be modified.

00:07:08.938 --> 00:07:12.276
In the last few weeks or months of life

00:07:12.276 --> 00:07:15.091
you may disengage, but
all the time before that,

00:07:15.091 --> 00:07:18.841
I was seeing a story of
tremendous engagement

00:07:20.593 --> 00:07:25.192
and looking at the
circumstances that created it,

00:07:25.192 --> 00:07:26.399
fostered it.

00:07:26.399 --> 00:07:30.161
- I like to ask my guests
what advice they would give

00:07:30.161 --> 00:07:32.328
to students who would like

00:07:33.969 --> 00:07:38.136
to prepare for a career
similar to that of my guest.

00:07:39.751 --> 00:07:44.232
Now what do you see as
the skills and temperament

00:07:44.232 --> 00:07:48.399
involved in the work of a
sociologist such as yourself?

00:07:52.504 --> 00:07:54.130
- Oh wow.

00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:56.471
I think, first of all,

00:07:56.471 --> 00:08:00.744
it's good to have
earlier been a little bit

00:08:00.744 --> 00:08:03.470
estranged from your circumstances.

00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:05.026
Strange thing to say,

00:08:05.026 --> 00:08:08.253
but to have been the oddball,
to have been the outsider.

00:08:08.253 --> 00:08:12.996
And I think sociology's
discipline isn't something

00:08:12.996 --> 00:08:15.753
people fall into, I think
they're attracted to it

00:08:15.753 --> 00:08:19.670
because they've been
exposed to that experience

00:08:20.893 --> 00:08:25.060
and it makes them curious
about membership in a group.

00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:30.596
So if you've got that, it's
a good sign, not a bad sign.

00:08:30.596 --> 00:08:33.179
And then I think your capacity,

00:08:35.682 --> 00:08:39.765
well as for any discipline,
to be really curious.

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:44.389
To relax about yourself,
to be really curious

00:08:44.389 --> 00:08:48.472
about the issue or problem
you've taken to study.

00:08:49.683 --> 00:08:52.864
To be able to take your
own alarm system off

00:08:52.864 --> 00:08:56.998
and listen to people that
you know disagree with you.

00:08:56.998 --> 00:08:59.247
That's a very important skill.

00:08:59.247 --> 00:09:01.313
And the other thing I'd says is look,

00:09:01.313 --> 00:09:04.146
you will be told how to do
things in graduate school,

00:09:04.146 --> 00:09:07.376
and some of the things
you're gonna have to unlearn.

00:09:07.376 --> 00:09:10.709
Don't take it quite as written in stone.

00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:16.104
- What about temperament?

00:09:16.104 --> 00:09:19.104
The temperament of someone who wants

00:09:20.124 --> 00:09:21.506
to go in to sociology?

00:09:21.506 --> 00:09:24.397
You've already partly
answered that question.

00:09:24.397 --> 00:09:27.184
But in others words, in
the end it takes courage

00:09:27.184 --> 00:09:31.267
to be at this boundary,
to be an oddball yourself

00:09:33.241 --> 00:09:35.334
in a way, and be looking at things

00:09:35.334 --> 00:09:38.724
and trying to find the complexity.

00:09:38.724 --> 00:09:39.978
- I'm not sure.

00:09:39.978 --> 00:09:43.478
I have friends and colleagues in sociology

00:09:45.458 --> 00:09:47.664
that have every kind of temperament.

00:09:47.664 --> 00:09:50.194
And some do historical
work, extraordinary,

00:09:50.194 --> 00:09:54.361
really insightful historical
work and comparative work.

00:09:56.185 --> 00:10:00.638
Some of my friends are studying
the general social survey

00:10:00.638 --> 00:10:03.581
and it doesn't call on those skills.

00:10:03.581 --> 00:10:06.414
But those of us who learn close up

00:10:07.551 --> 00:10:09.468
by studying encounters,

00:10:11.592 --> 00:10:15.469
then I think we do need
this kind of temperament.

00:10:15.469 --> 00:10:19.636
- You are considered to be a
pioneer in feminist studies

00:10:20.996 --> 00:10:25.163
in sociology, and also in
the sociology of emotions.

00:10:27.602 --> 00:10:30.352
So you're a pathbreaking scholar.

00:10:31.561 --> 00:10:34.278
My next question is about creativity.

00:10:34.278 --> 00:10:38.039
What are the factors
that make sociologists

00:10:38.039 --> 00:10:40.206
such as yourself creative,

00:10:41.865 --> 00:10:43.865
and carve out new paths?

00:10:44.741 --> 00:10:45.574
- Wow.

00:10:46.646 --> 00:10:49.063
Thank you for the compliment.

00:10:51.338 --> 00:10:55.171
I think to experiment,
this'll be paradoxical,

00:10:57.051 --> 00:10:58.801
we have to feel safe.

00:11:00.417 --> 00:11:02.000
So it is a paradox.

00:11:03.296 --> 00:11:06.339
You think of the explorer
as someone who does without

00:11:06.339 --> 00:11:10.506
a sense of safety, who stalks
ahead stoically without it.

00:11:12.910 --> 00:11:15.023
It's not been my experience.

00:11:15.023 --> 00:11:19.023
And what I tell my students
is, get your cocoon.

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:24.218
You know, get your family,
get your best friends,

00:11:24.218 --> 00:11:26.968
make a book group, a study group,

00:11:29.578 --> 00:11:31.834
get your support system.

00:11:31.834 --> 00:11:36.001
Then, with that support,
it won't be so frightening

00:11:38.498 --> 00:11:42.665
to reach out, you'll have
someone to report back to.

00:11:44.141 --> 00:11:47.558
And then, I actually think that the world

00:11:48.433 --> 00:11:51.100
draws us into it, if you let it.

00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:54.241
Like people have asked me,

00:11:54.241 --> 00:11:56.865
with regard to the research I did

00:11:56.865 --> 00:11:58.858
for Strangers In Their Own Land,

00:11:58.858 --> 00:12:02.441
oh my goodness, how
did you, they must have

00:12:04.713 --> 00:12:09.566
felt like you came from Mars
and been unfriendly to you,

00:12:09.566 --> 00:12:12.330
and how did you get going with them?

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:16.509
Well not at all, that
wasn't my experience.

00:12:16.509 --> 00:12:19.319
I would say hi, I'm Arlie Hochschild,

00:12:19.319 --> 00:12:22.128
the one with the
unpronounceable last name,

00:12:22.128 --> 00:12:26.122
and I probably look like
Mary Poppins to you,

00:12:26.122 --> 00:12:28.393
(laughing) I come from
Berkeley California,

00:12:28.393 --> 00:12:30.395
I teach in the Sociology Department,

00:12:30.395 --> 00:12:33.246
and I live in a bubble,
a very different one,

00:12:33.246 --> 00:12:34.852
but I've been really concerned

00:12:34.852 --> 00:12:38.269
about how divided our country has become.

00:12:39.194 --> 00:12:41.192
And then I would see a nodded head,

00:12:41.192 --> 00:12:44.832
yeah we're worried about that too.

00:12:44.832 --> 00:12:47.832
And so I'm here really to understand

00:12:48.756 --> 00:12:52.018
people that live in your bubble,

00:12:52.018 --> 00:12:55.710
and see if there aren't
some common threads here,

00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:58.334
and common ground that
we're not looking at.

00:12:58.334 --> 00:13:02.084
So I began like that,
and they would say yes.

00:13:03.068 --> 00:13:05.439
Well people where you come from

00:13:05.439 --> 00:13:09.106
think we're backward,
and hicks and southern

00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:12.081
and uneducated, so you set them straight,

00:13:12.081 --> 00:13:13.874
yes come on.

00:13:13.874 --> 00:13:17.009
- So you call in your
book the empathy wall,

00:13:17.009 --> 00:13:21.003
climbing that wall to see
what's on the other side.

00:13:21.003 --> 00:13:23.185
But it sounds to me like there's a lot of

00:13:23.185 --> 00:13:27.085
diplomacy involved, diplomatic skills,

00:13:27.085 --> 00:13:30.058
I won't say diplomacy, because
I think you're being honest,

00:13:30.058 --> 00:13:32.688
diplomats aren't always honest.

00:13:32.688 --> 00:13:35.613
But there are skills involved.

00:13:35.613 --> 00:13:37.193
- Skills.

00:13:37.193 --> 00:13:39.026
Yes I think there are,

00:13:40.653 --> 00:13:42.820
and the main skill I think

00:13:44.824 --> 00:13:47.657
involved in really getting to know

00:13:50.329 --> 00:13:52.727
and listening closely

00:13:52.727 --> 00:13:56.416
and feeling comfortable listening closely

00:13:56.416 --> 00:13:58.581
to people who are saying things

00:13:58.581 --> 00:14:00.456
that you have strong feelings about,

00:14:00.456 --> 00:14:04.380
and commitments behind those feelings,

00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:06.713
the main thing is to be able

00:14:08.606 --> 00:14:12.595
to take your alarm system
off for a period of time,

00:14:12.595 --> 00:14:14.512
and be honest about it.

00:14:15.967 --> 00:14:17.430
I'll give you example.

00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:21.597
There was one woman I met in
doing research for Strangers,

00:14:22.816 --> 00:14:25.693
at the Republican Women
for Southwest Louisiana.

00:14:25.693 --> 00:14:29.276
She was the wife of a
Pentecostal minister,

00:14:30.178 --> 00:14:31.571
big mega church.

00:14:31.571 --> 00:14:34.914
And she was a wonderful gospel singer.

00:14:34.914 --> 00:14:38.081
And she said, oh I love Rush Limbaugh,

00:14:39.323 --> 00:14:42.073
the very conservative radio host.

00:14:44.574 --> 00:14:46.443
And I thought to myself privately,

00:14:46.443 --> 00:14:48.026
oh dear dear, whoa.

00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:53.804
And then I thought, no I
wanna understand her love.

00:14:53.804 --> 00:14:55.987
So I said, could I speak with you?

00:14:55.987 --> 00:14:59.282
So we did, next day we met for sweet tea.

00:14:59.282 --> 00:15:03.301
And she's telling me I love Rush Limbaugh

00:15:03.301 --> 00:15:07.134
because he really gives
it to those feminazis.

00:15:08.127 --> 00:15:12.294
I thought I hope she hasn't
read The Second Shift.

00:15:15.134 --> 00:15:17.717
And those environmental wackos.

00:15:19.774 --> 00:15:21.310
And so I'm listening to her,

00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:25.905
and she then says to me,
has it been hard to listen?

00:15:25.905 --> 00:15:28.066
Because I know, you've told me,

00:15:28.066 --> 00:15:31.292
that you don't agree with what I'm saying.

00:15:31.292 --> 00:15:34.174
And I told her, you know
actually not at all.

00:15:34.174 --> 00:15:36.148
Because I'm not here to tell you about me,

00:15:36.148 --> 00:15:37.912
I'm here to learn.

00:15:37.912 --> 00:15:41.904
And you are doing me a
bigger favor than you know.

00:15:41.904 --> 00:15:45.404
I am so grateful that you're letting me in

00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:50.218
to your way of thinking and
sharing your life with me.

00:15:50.218 --> 00:15:53.385
And then, she said yes, I do that too.

00:15:55.277 --> 00:15:56.953
With my parishioners, with my kids,

00:15:56.953 --> 00:15:59.136
I don't always have to start with me.

00:15:59.136 --> 00:16:01.719
So then we have that in common.

00:16:02.944 --> 00:16:07.027
So then, okay let's start
there, we both do that.

00:16:09.817 --> 00:16:12.046
And then I really began to learn something

00:16:12.046 --> 00:16:14.149
because then she said,

00:16:14.149 --> 00:16:17.984
Rush Limbaugh feels like my
Braveheart, she called him,

00:16:17.984 --> 00:16:22.067
because she protects me
from the liberal epithets

00:16:23.116 --> 00:16:26.527
of you racist, homophobic, sexist,

00:16:26.527 --> 00:16:27.527
fat redneck,

00:16:31.262 --> 00:16:35.121
that she felt the liberals
were lobbing at her.

00:16:35.121 --> 00:16:38.454
I didn't know that people felt that way,

00:16:39.422 --> 00:16:44.089
that that was what they
got from listening to him.

00:16:44.089 --> 00:16:48.256
So I learned a lot only after
sharing this thing with her.

00:16:49.662 --> 00:16:52.123
So it went like that.

00:16:52.123 --> 00:16:54.873
- So you are considered a pioneer

00:16:56.349 --> 00:17:00.016
in what is called the
sociology of emotions.

00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:04.328
And I read a little about that.

00:17:04.328 --> 00:17:08.322
And you're, in a way,
looking for the rules

00:17:08.322 --> 00:17:11.322
that help people define the emotions

00:17:15.009 --> 00:17:18.342
that are permitted in different settings

00:17:19.491 --> 00:17:21.557
and different contexts.

00:17:21.557 --> 00:17:24.307
So this was a powerful background

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:29.078
in helping you on this journey

00:17:29.078 --> 00:17:32.558
that you've already begun describing.

00:17:32.558 --> 00:17:34.584
- And there's one other ingredient,

00:17:34.584 --> 00:17:39.376
if I look back at myself, what
am I putting together here?

00:17:39.376 --> 00:17:43.208
I think I'm putting together
my early experiences

00:17:43.208 --> 00:17:46.017
in being the oddball in
these different countries.

00:17:46.017 --> 00:17:49.850
And I suppose watching
my father the diplomat.

00:17:51.242 --> 00:17:54.909
But I had a brother who
was a psychoanalyst.

00:17:57.233 --> 00:18:01.255
And he gave me the feeling, older brother,

00:18:01.255 --> 00:18:02.255
of you know,

00:18:04.506 --> 00:18:06.673
all of the covert patterns

00:18:08.268 --> 00:18:12.958
and intrapsychic, unconscious
processes that go on.

00:18:12.958 --> 00:18:14.950
I was fascinated by that.

00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:19.117
And yet it felt too locked
into an intrapsychic system,

00:18:20.151 --> 00:18:23.192
it didn't have the sociology of it,

00:18:23.192 --> 00:18:25.747
that I'd been exposed to as a kid,

00:18:25.747 --> 00:18:27.902
look at all these different groups.

00:18:27.902 --> 00:18:31.285
So this set of rules applies differently

00:18:31.285 --> 00:18:33.375
to these different groups.

00:18:33.375 --> 00:18:36.857
And I think I went to
sociology to get some tools

00:18:36.857 --> 00:18:39.319
for how to put these two things together.

00:18:39.319 --> 00:18:40.317
- Interesting.

00:18:40.317 --> 00:18:41.400
So this book,

00:18:44.076 --> 00:18:46.409
Strangers In Their Own Land,

00:18:48.862 --> 00:18:50.779
is a departure for you,

00:18:51.695 --> 00:18:54.087
in the sense not of your methodology

00:18:54.087 --> 00:18:57.173
and the things that we're talking about

00:18:57.173 --> 00:18:59.868
in terms of the sociology of emotions,

00:18:59.868 --> 00:19:02.324
but rather in terms of the subject matter.

00:19:02.324 --> 00:19:04.907
And I think the dates are very important.

00:19:04.907 --> 00:19:07.657
So the book is published in 2016,

00:19:08.692 --> 00:19:11.775
and you started the work on this book

00:19:15.936 --> 00:19:19.269
by going to Louisiana five years before.

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:23.553
So why did you choose this subject

00:19:26.711 --> 00:19:29.461
and why did you choose Louisiana?

00:19:30.728 --> 00:19:33.645
- Well I chose this subject because

00:19:37.601 --> 00:19:40.991
I was worried that there
was rumbling on the right,

00:19:40.991 --> 00:19:43.491
that there was a growth of it.

00:19:48.056 --> 00:19:52.674
And that it stood, and I
felt that it would grow,

00:19:52.674 --> 00:19:55.161
I had that intuition about it.

00:19:55.161 --> 00:19:56.601
I'm not the only one,

00:19:56.601 --> 00:20:00.768
something was going on and
I didn't understand it.

00:20:02.914 --> 00:20:04.414
But why Louisiana?

00:20:05.642 --> 00:20:08.800
Well I figured, I'm in a bubble
here in Berkeley California,

00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:11.795
let me find an equal and opposite bubble

00:20:11.795 --> 00:20:14.070
that's as far right as

00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:17.739
sociology Berkeley California is left.

00:20:17.739 --> 00:20:21.199
And where would that be,
that would be in the South.

00:20:21.199 --> 00:20:24.199
And I looked at the number of whites

00:20:31.141 --> 00:20:34.058
who voted for Barack Obama in 2012.

00:20:36.902 --> 00:20:40.524
And in the whole region of
the South, it was a third.

00:20:40.524 --> 00:20:43.100
But in Louisiana and Mississippi,

00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:45.683
Louisiana it was just 14%.

00:20:46.906 --> 00:20:51.293
So that's the super-South,
that's where I wanna go.

00:20:51.293 --> 00:20:53.543
And it was, surveys showed,

00:20:56.332 --> 00:21:00.092
virtually half of the
population said it agreed

00:21:00.092 --> 00:21:02.764
with the tenets of the Tea Party.

00:21:02.764 --> 00:21:05.264
That was five years ago, 2011.

00:21:06.684 --> 00:21:08.337
And so I thought okay, this was perfect.

00:21:08.337 --> 00:21:12.504
So who do I want? I want
whites, I want religious people,

00:21:14.072 --> 00:21:15.989
and where in Louisiana?

00:21:16.835 --> 00:21:17.668
Well,

00:21:19.134 --> 00:21:23.051
I was interested in the
petrochemical industry.

00:21:24.101 --> 00:21:26.170
- And pollution.

00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:27.540
- And pollution.

00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:32.323
Because pollution became
the keyhole issue for me.

00:21:32.323 --> 00:21:36.490
Because I started, with this
open mind, alarm system off,

00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:40.752
but with the a question,
the red state paradox.

00:21:40.752 --> 00:21:43.074
How can it be that in the whole country

00:21:43.074 --> 00:21:45.210
it's the poorest states,

00:21:45.210 --> 00:21:47.950
it's the states with the worst schools,

00:21:47.950 --> 00:21:52.292
the worst medical care, the
most disrupted families,

00:21:52.292 --> 00:21:55.375
the highest number of road accidents,

00:21:56.356 --> 00:22:00.523
the worst pollution, and
the lowest life expectancy

00:22:03.345 --> 00:22:05.458
are also the states that get more money

00:22:05.458 --> 00:22:07.571
from the federal government in aid

00:22:07.571 --> 00:22:09.913
than they give to it in tax dollars,

00:22:09.913 --> 00:22:12.796
and revile the federal government.

00:22:12.796 --> 00:22:15.605
Well, wait a minute,
if you have a problem,

00:22:15.605 --> 00:22:18.043
don't you want some help with it?

00:22:18.043 --> 00:22:20.247
So that was the red state paradox.

00:22:20.247 --> 00:22:22.246
And I discovered that Louisiana

00:22:22.246 --> 00:22:24.127
was an exaggerated version of that,

00:22:24.127 --> 00:22:26.147
as the second poorest state.

00:22:26.147 --> 00:22:29.676
44% of the state budget came
from the federal government,

00:22:29.676 --> 00:22:31.843
overwhelming conservative,

00:22:33.763 --> 00:22:36.178
and in the end very pro-Trump.

00:22:36.178 --> 00:22:39.104
So that was an exaggerated version

00:22:39.104 --> 00:22:41.542
of this red state paradox.

00:22:41.542 --> 00:22:44.421
And then I began to smell the air,

00:22:44.421 --> 00:22:47.440
and look at everybody
who had water bottles.

00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:51.273
And sometimes when I
drove over the I10 bridge

00:22:52.336 --> 00:22:54.684
in Lake Charles to West Lake,

00:22:54.684 --> 00:22:58.701
there's this vast, almost industrial city,

00:22:58.701 --> 00:23:01.118
my eyes would begin to sting.

00:23:02.927 --> 00:23:05.574
And people lived here, gee.

00:23:05.574 --> 00:23:07.362
So then I looked and found it was

00:23:07.362 --> 00:23:11.333
one of the most polluted
spots on the earth.

00:23:11.333 --> 00:23:14.955
And the people did not believe
in regulating polluters.

00:23:14.955 --> 00:23:17.622
So I thought, let me focus here.

00:23:20.273 --> 00:23:23.918
- So what I'm hearing you say suggests

00:23:23.918 --> 00:23:26.835
that as a matter of choice you pick

00:23:27.934 --> 00:23:29.767
the perfect petri dish

00:23:31.697 --> 00:23:35.864
to find groups of people who
clearly were being driven

00:23:39.174 --> 00:23:43.091
by something other than
the reality, the facts,

00:23:50.871 --> 00:23:52.920
and seem to be drawing

00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:55.288
on their emotions, basically.

00:23:55.288 --> 00:23:58.075
Seemed to be feeling something

00:23:58.075 --> 00:23:59.825
that was inconsistent

00:24:03.044 --> 00:24:07.816
with what a Berkeley
scholar or Berkeley denizens

00:24:07.816 --> 00:24:10.566
would conclude based on the facts

00:24:11.577 --> 00:24:14.642
and perceptions of the facts.

00:24:14.642 --> 00:24:16.105
- I would put it differently.

00:24:16.105 --> 00:24:20.272
They were acting according to
what they saw as the facts.

00:24:24.395 --> 00:24:26.368
They had different priorities,

00:24:26.368 --> 00:24:28.435
that their facts loomed large,

00:24:28.435 --> 00:24:31.018
and my facts didn't loom large.

00:24:31.963 --> 00:24:35.471
So this was self-interest as they saw it.

00:24:35.471 --> 00:24:37.328
It wasn't just emotions floating free

00:24:37.328 --> 00:24:39.661
from facts as they saw them.

00:24:41.342 --> 00:24:44.842
So this red state paradox, I tried it out.

00:24:48.752 --> 00:24:52.881
One guy, who begins the book, Mike Schapp,

00:24:52.881 --> 00:24:55.416
we were out fishing, and I thought,

00:24:55.416 --> 00:24:58.064
well this is a good place for
me to just put it out there,

00:24:58.064 --> 00:25:00.687
what about this red state paradox?

00:25:00.687 --> 00:25:03.079
And he said, well we're
embarrassed about it,

00:25:03.079 --> 00:25:06.974
we don't like being the
second poorest state,

00:25:06.974 --> 00:25:09.047
but that's why we want an economy.

00:25:09.047 --> 00:25:13.214
And this other thing is more
important than that paradox.

00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:19.008
So you liberals come in and
you focus on this paradox,

00:25:19.008 --> 00:25:20.796
and you think we're crazy.

00:25:20.796 --> 00:25:23.327
No no, we know it's there,

00:25:23.327 --> 00:25:26.327
but it's trumped by this other thing

00:25:27.251 --> 00:25:30.198
that I came to call the deep story.

00:25:30.198 --> 00:25:31.570
- The deep story.

00:25:31.570 --> 00:25:35.750
So the deep story, tell
us what a deep story is,

00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:39.070
and then what the deep
story of Louisiana is.

00:25:39.070 --> 00:25:40.370
- Yeah.

00:25:40.370 --> 00:25:41.620
A deep story is

00:25:44.479 --> 00:25:47.479
a story about some salient situation

00:25:51.864 --> 00:25:53.197
that feels true.

00:25:54.047 --> 00:25:57.135
You take facts out of the deep story,

00:25:57.135 --> 00:26:00.684
you strip moral precepts
out of the deep story,

00:26:00.684 --> 00:26:03.434
it's just what feels true to you.

00:26:04.937 --> 00:26:08.437
And it is, you get to feelings by a story,

00:26:10.254 --> 00:26:13.273
that is with what T.S. Eliot would call

00:26:13.273 --> 00:26:16.523
the objective correlatives to feelings.

00:26:19.705 --> 00:26:23.327
What has to seem true
to you to feel angry,

00:26:23.327 --> 00:26:25.910
to feel grief, to feel despair.

00:26:27.484 --> 00:26:31.803
So I was looking for the
objective correlatives

00:26:31.803 --> 00:26:35.471
to what felt true if you
stripped away the feeling rules

00:26:35.471 --> 00:26:37.638
as I call them in my work.

00:26:43.293 --> 00:26:44.126
And,

00:26:47.406 --> 00:26:48.739
their deep story

00:26:50.193 --> 00:26:54.163
is that, it can be told
in almost a dreamlike way,

00:26:54.163 --> 00:26:55.746
through a metaphor,

00:26:56.950 --> 00:27:01.033
that you're standing in
line, as in a pilgrimage,

00:27:02.290 --> 00:27:03.800
facing up a hill.

00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:06.029
At the top of the hill
is the American dream,

00:27:06.029 --> 00:27:08.362
and your feet are facing it.

00:27:11.648 --> 00:27:15.085
And you feel you really
deserve that dream,

00:27:15.085 --> 00:27:17.613
you have worked hard,
you've played by the rules,

00:27:17.613 --> 00:27:19.287
but the line isn't moving.

00:27:19.287 --> 00:27:21.702
People haven't had a raise in two decades,

00:27:21.702 --> 00:27:23.619
the ones I interviewed.

00:27:24.883 --> 00:27:27.670
So you're waiting in line,

00:27:27.670 --> 00:27:30.758
and the prize is there,
you're getting on in years,

00:27:30.758 --> 00:27:33.405
now's the time for the reward.

00:27:33.405 --> 00:27:35.329
And then you see some line-cutters,

00:27:35.329 --> 00:27:38.328
and you think well wait
a minute, it's not fair.

00:27:38.328 --> 00:27:41.829
And who are they, they
are blacks and women

00:27:41.829 --> 00:27:46.477
who through federally-mandated
affirmative action programs

00:27:46.477 --> 00:27:50.444
are finally being given access
to jobs and opportunities

00:27:50.444 --> 00:27:54.530
that had been reserved for whites and men.

00:27:54.530 --> 00:27:58.197
And then immigrants and
refugees and others.

00:28:01.037 --> 00:28:05.797
And then another moment of
this right-wing deep story,

00:28:05.797 --> 00:28:10.116
the leader who should be
impartially supervising this line

00:28:10.116 --> 00:28:14.110
seems to be waving to the line-cutters.

00:28:14.110 --> 00:28:16.850
And who is that, that's Barack Obama.

00:28:16.850 --> 00:28:19.497
And then people would say,

00:28:19.497 --> 00:28:21.582
oh he must be a line-cutter too.

00:28:21.582 --> 00:28:25.553
How did he get, how did his mother pay for

00:28:25.553 --> 00:28:27.252
a Harvard education?

00:28:27.252 --> 00:28:29.318
Must be something fishy.

00:28:29.318 --> 00:28:31.269
I heard that time and time again.

00:28:31.269 --> 00:28:34.602
Questioning how he could have done this,

00:28:35.867 --> 00:28:37.117
and envy in it.

00:28:38.514 --> 00:28:41.532
We misunderstand racial feeling.

00:28:41.532 --> 00:28:44.152
It's not just fear of, you know,

00:28:44.152 --> 00:28:46.153
the thug who will come to the door.

00:28:46.153 --> 00:28:47.848
No no, this is envy,

00:28:47.848 --> 00:28:49.865
he's so well-spoken, he's so intelligent,

00:28:49.865 --> 00:28:53.282
he's gone to Harvard and Columbia, wow.

00:28:53.282 --> 00:28:54.115
So anyway,

00:28:57.624 --> 00:29:01.385
that alliance makes them feel cut out.

00:29:01.385 --> 00:29:03.870
They've waited in line,
they are forgotten,

00:29:03.870 --> 00:29:05.787
this is not their land.

00:29:07.028 --> 00:29:11.208
And then add to that
that the land they're on

00:29:11.208 --> 00:29:14.389
in fact is polluted, it is not their land.

00:29:14.389 --> 00:29:16.246
It's been polluted by industry,

00:29:16.246 --> 00:29:18.800
public waters aren't
public waters anymore.

00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:22.771
And that leads to a
kind of an estrangement,

00:29:22.771 --> 00:29:25.093
and a looking around for rescue.

00:29:25.093 --> 00:29:27.736
So that was the deep story.

00:29:27.736 --> 00:29:31.153
I got to it by listening for a long time,

00:29:35.376 --> 00:29:39.394
making up that story, and
then going back to my people

00:29:39.394 --> 00:29:40.811
and trying again.

00:29:41.765 --> 00:29:44.203
How does this sit with you?

00:29:44.203 --> 00:29:47.013
Yeah, people said, I live your metaphor,

00:29:47.013 --> 00:29:49.540
how did you read my mind?

00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:50.728
And then some people would say,

00:29:50.728 --> 00:29:54.211
no no, the end, we move
over to another line,

00:29:54.211 --> 00:29:57.378
or secede from the country, basically.

00:29:58.274 --> 00:30:02.404
Or, no you've left out
that we line-waiters

00:30:02.404 --> 00:30:06.355
are paying through our
taxes for the line-cutters,

00:30:06.355 --> 00:30:07.516
and that's not fair.

00:30:07.516 --> 00:30:10.651
So they elaborated the story.

00:30:10.651 --> 00:30:13.734
But basically, it made sense to them.

00:30:16.502 --> 00:30:20.914
So it's not that they're
irrational, in one sense,

00:30:20.914 --> 00:30:25.081
it's that we have to
understand how the world looks,

00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:32.686
the standpoint that people
on the right are taking.

00:30:32.686 --> 00:30:35.333
And by the way, I think all of us,

00:30:35.333 --> 00:30:38.468
wherever we land on
the political spectrum,

00:30:38.468 --> 00:30:40.488
have a deep story.

00:30:40.488 --> 00:30:43.294
- So, what's interesting about this is,

00:30:43.294 --> 00:30:47.461
in your book you go through
the many factors at work

00:30:48.313 --> 00:30:52.480
from history, the nature of
the South's political culture,

00:30:54.930 --> 00:30:58.180
where the dominating and the dominated,

00:31:01.247 --> 00:31:05.080
related to slavery and
the white working class

00:31:06.982 --> 00:31:10.982
not looking and comparing
themselves to the top,

00:31:12.114 --> 00:31:15.155
because they always believed
they could rise to that level,

00:31:15.155 --> 00:31:16.688
but looking down and saying,

00:31:16.688 --> 00:31:18.685
well we're better than the blacks.

00:31:18.685 --> 00:31:22.674
- Or, oh my God, let
that not happen to us.

00:31:22.674 --> 00:31:25.721
- So this is kind of built
in to the political culture

00:31:25.721 --> 00:31:26.804
of the South.

00:31:28.275 --> 00:31:32.171
And the left comes along after the 60s

00:31:32.171 --> 00:31:36.338
and emphasizes identity, and
it's important to politics.

00:31:39.165 --> 00:31:43.332
So the notion of the identity
of a black, of a woman,

00:31:45.571 --> 00:31:48.071
of a gay person, is important,

00:31:50.121 --> 00:31:53.654
and that is thrust at these people,

00:31:53.654 --> 00:31:57.439
and it helps push them toward the emphasis

00:31:57.439 --> 00:31:58.763
on a white identity.

00:31:58.763 --> 00:32:01.096
So there's a white identity,

00:32:02.222 --> 00:32:04.219
their identity as a white person.

00:32:04.219 --> 00:32:08.386
So a lot is going on, there's
a lot of complexity here.

00:32:09.392 --> 00:32:12.576
But you, in talking to individuals,

00:32:12.576 --> 00:32:16.271
are able to conceptualize this deep story

00:32:16.271 --> 00:32:19.127
that in a way pulls it all together.

00:32:19.127 --> 00:32:20.210
Is that fair?

00:32:21.263 --> 00:32:22.817
- Well thank you.

00:32:22.817 --> 00:32:23.650
You know,

00:32:25.001 --> 00:32:27.370
of course the civil rights movement

00:32:27.370 --> 00:32:31.537
was focusing on rights, not
so much identity but rights.

00:32:32.408 --> 00:32:34.521
- That came later, the identity politics.

00:32:34.521 --> 00:32:36.147
- The identity politics came later.

00:32:36.147 --> 00:32:38.980
But yeah, the focus was on rights,

00:32:43.043 --> 00:32:46.155
which were constitutional and fundamental,

00:32:46.155 --> 00:32:48.905
but not implemented in the South.

00:32:54.835 --> 00:32:57.718
And from their, and of
course my husband and I

00:32:57.718 --> 00:33:00.087
were civil rights workers,

00:33:00.087 --> 00:33:03.504
actually at Vicksburg, Mississippi, 1964,

00:33:07.192 --> 00:33:08.376
freedom summer.

00:33:08.376 --> 00:33:10.791
So that was about rights.

00:33:10.791 --> 00:33:13.791
But from the point of view of whites

00:33:15.690 --> 00:33:19.607
whose ancestors were in
the 1860s poor farmers,

00:33:26.395 --> 00:33:29.802
they were not slave
owners, but they fought,

00:33:29.802 --> 00:33:32.135
they were the cannon fodder.

00:33:33.361 --> 00:33:37.528
And in fact, as Cash in The
Mind Of The South makes clear,

00:33:39.613 --> 00:33:40.946
poor whites were

00:33:42.492 --> 00:33:44.825
shoved off of the good land,

00:33:45.743 --> 00:33:49.061
they were put back in the
swamps and the hinterlands,

00:33:49.061 --> 00:33:52.987
and their labor wasn't needed
because of slave labor.

00:33:52.987 --> 00:33:54.987
So they could grow corn,

00:33:56.819 --> 00:34:00.986
but even the forests didn't
provide hunting for them

00:34:02.949 --> 00:34:04.621
because that became off limits.

00:34:04.621 --> 00:34:08.788
So anyway, the whites have
historically been marginalized,

00:34:10.217 --> 00:34:13.300
they've historically kind of grown up

00:34:14.396 --> 00:34:16.718
in a culture that Church is pointing out

00:34:16.718 --> 00:34:20.468
didn't have any tradition
of a public square,

00:34:22.152 --> 00:34:26.378
and of public goods, of a public commons,

00:34:26.378 --> 00:34:28.955
of great schools and museums.

00:34:28.955 --> 00:34:32.705
That wasn't part of the
plantation tradition.

00:34:33.808 --> 00:34:37.036
And their only way out
would be to identify up,

00:34:37.036 --> 00:34:40.869
and distance themselves
from the abject slave.

00:34:42.539 --> 00:34:46.289
So that's the culture
that they've inherited,

00:34:48.204 --> 00:34:51.871
and I think that one
has to acknowledge that

00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:58.137
and begin a whole series of
conversations about that.

00:34:58.137 --> 00:35:01.387
Starting with the idea of human rights.

00:35:03.106 --> 00:35:04.689
- So the deep story

00:35:05.852 --> 00:35:09.636
is a conceptual construct
that is more than a concept,

00:35:09.636 --> 00:35:13.803
because when you run this by
the people they agree with it.

00:35:14.861 --> 00:35:17.111
But it fits into a context,

00:35:20.103 --> 00:35:23.795
both in terms of history,
in terms of institutions,

00:35:23.795 --> 00:35:25.449
you look at the press,

00:35:25.449 --> 00:35:28.782
you look at the government in Louisiana,

00:35:31.695 --> 00:35:35.862
and what is bizarre is the
people who you're interviewing

00:35:37.013 --> 00:35:40.596
are people who hunt,
who love the outdoors.

00:35:41.816 --> 00:35:46.672
So they're almost Californian
in their appreciation

00:35:46.672 --> 00:35:49.923
of their surroundings,
and so they are watching

00:35:49.923 --> 00:35:52.756
the erosion of the natural beauty.

00:35:54.364 --> 00:35:57.281
Now something comes up in the story

00:35:58.706 --> 00:36:02.305
when you talk to the general who commanded

00:36:02.305 --> 00:36:05.017
the saving of New Orleans.

00:36:05.017 --> 00:36:08.807
And he talks about the importance of jobs.

00:36:08.807 --> 00:36:12.974
So what the oil companies
and the polluting industries

00:36:15.401 --> 00:36:17.468
offer for jobs.

00:36:17.468 --> 00:36:20.968
And these people see jobs, jobs jobs jobs,

00:36:23.853 --> 00:36:27.853
as a way to transcend
what is happening to them,

00:36:29.612 --> 00:36:33.779
and give them honor and
security and other things.

00:36:35.784 --> 00:36:37.460
And that really comes out in your book,

00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:39.480
it's very interesting.

00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:42.819
- Yes, and you're speaking
of General Russell Honore

00:36:42.819 --> 00:36:46.402
who was an absolutely
extraordinary figure,

00:36:47.561 --> 00:36:50.510
and with brilliant mediation skills.

00:36:50.510 --> 00:36:54.677
I followed him around just
to listen to how he talked.

00:36:56.617 --> 00:36:57.950
And what he said

00:37:01.191 --> 00:37:04.042
is that there's just enough

00:37:04.042 --> 00:37:07.667
to the rhetoric of jobs jobs jobs,

00:37:07.667 --> 00:37:11.417
to make them swallow a
psychological program.

00:37:12.614 --> 00:37:16.281
And I looked at the
statistics in Louisiana,

00:37:17.509 --> 00:37:21.676
actually only 15% of jobs
have anything to do with oil.

00:37:23.225 --> 00:37:26.058
These are highly-automated plants,

00:37:28.610 --> 00:37:32.777
and there are very few
permanent jobs in those plants.

00:37:34.001 --> 00:37:38.645
And even then, they import
Filipino pipefitters,

00:37:38.645 --> 00:37:40.897
for example, who are cheaper.

00:37:40.897 --> 00:37:43.564
So most jobs are outside of oil.

00:37:45.471 --> 00:37:50.017
And in fact, what could
be booming industries,

00:37:50.017 --> 00:37:52.623
tourism, it's a beautiful state,

00:37:52.623 --> 00:37:56.206
could be an extraordinary
tourism industry.

00:37:57.801 --> 00:38:02.515
But oil has kind of wrecked
that by polluting the place.

00:38:02.515 --> 00:38:04.848
And restaurants and fishing,

00:38:07.646 --> 00:38:09.646
this is hurt by oil too.

00:38:11.524 --> 00:38:15.691
So we've gone, in Louisiana,
from a plantation system,

00:38:17.737 --> 00:38:21.154
you know used to be cotton, now it's oil.

00:38:22.148 --> 00:38:25.373
And there is a political culture

00:38:25.373 --> 00:38:29.456
that is oriented to a
dominant economic interest.

00:38:34.687 --> 00:38:36.847
And the people I came to know in Louisiana

00:38:36.847 --> 00:38:41.723
were used to a state that
did the bidding of industry.

00:38:41.723 --> 00:38:45.368
It's what we call a captured state.

00:38:45.368 --> 00:38:49.754
And so I came to understand
why they hated the government.

00:38:49.754 --> 00:38:52.032
Because they thought
the federal government

00:38:52.032 --> 00:38:54.421
is just a bigger, badder
version of the state government,

00:38:54.421 --> 00:38:58.673
and our state government isn't helping us.

00:38:58.673 --> 00:39:01.553
And they got that idea by looking

00:39:01.553 --> 00:39:06.081
at Louisiana Department
of Environmental Quality,

00:39:06.081 --> 00:39:09.914
which gave out permits
to pollute very easily,

00:39:11.513 --> 00:39:14.013
and didn't protect the people.

00:39:16.646 --> 00:39:20.813
So in a way, industry
outsourced the moral dirty work

00:39:23.194 --> 00:39:24.633
to the states.

00:39:24.633 --> 00:39:27.141
So people thought, I'm paying the salary

00:39:27.141 --> 00:39:30.044
of people who aren't protecting me,

00:39:30.044 --> 00:39:32.246
why am I paying for that,
the state isn't working.

00:39:32.246 --> 00:39:34.383
But oh the industry is
talking jobs jobs jobs,

00:39:34.383 --> 00:39:37.050
and by the way it's giving money

00:39:38.356 --> 00:39:40.273
to the Audubon Society,

00:39:41.514 --> 00:39:45.514
to Louisiana State
University football uniforms.

00:39:47.238 --> 00:39:50.489
And that's money that
actually is public money,

00:39:50.489 --> 00:39:52.996
because under Governor Jindal,

00:39:52.996 --> 00:39:55.996
$1.5 billion went as incentive money

00:39:58.926 --> 00:40:00.902
to the petro industry,

00:40:00.902 --> 00:40:03.663
and with that money they
could give out gifts.

00:40:03.663 --> 00:40:07.125
So you can see, actually this
is the sociology of emotions,

00:40:07.125 --> 00:40:09.284
that you can see industry
has been brilliant

00:40:09.284 --> 00:40:12.117
at getting itself loved, branding,

00:40:14.091 --> 00:40:16.413
and getting the state hated.

00:40:16.413 --> 00:40:21.126
And so it wasn't a mystery,
it wasn't irrational

00:40:21.126 --> 00:40:23.379
from their point of view

00:40:23.379 --> 00:40:26.546
to take a jaundiced view of the state.

00:40:29.555 --> 00:40:32.871
- Let's go back to the
timeline of this book,

00:40:32.871 --> 00:40:36.196
because you were making these discoveries,

00:40:36.196 --> 00:40:40.027
forming this conceptual
way of looking at it,

00:40:40.027 --> 00:40:42.442
before Trump was a candidate,

00:40:42.442 --> 00:40:44.204
most of this work was done.

00:40:44.204 --> 00:40:45.897
You published in 2016,

00:40:45.897 --> 00:40:48.874
I guess then he announces his candidacy.

00:40:48.874 --> 00:40:51.173
You talk a little about Trump,

00:40:51.173 --> 00:40:52.704
and going to a Trump rally,

00:40:52.704 --> 00:40:57.071
and you say Trump is
an emotions candidate.

00:40:57.071 --> 00:41:01.238
So having laid out for us
the landscape of emotions

00:41:02.226 --> 00:41:06.393
in the deep hard right,
you see a resonance there.

00:41:09.633 --> 00:41:10.631
- Oh I do.

00:41:10.631 --> 00:41:12.714
I think we can talk about

00:41:14.416 --> 00:41:18.333
people who have, who
pursue an emotional logic.

00:41:20.244 --> 00:41:23.994
In other words, what
they do to evoke emotion

00:41:27.346 --> 00:41:28.763
is not illogical.

00:41:30.228 --> 00:41:34.395
It can serve an important
purpose, it can be logical.

00:41:35.776 --> 00:41:39.943
And I think that's the way
to understand our president.

00:41:42.791 --> 00:41:43.791
For example,

00:41:47.528 --> 00:41:50.445
my interpretation of a recent event

00:41:52.355 --> 00:41:53.522
would be this:

00:41:58.464 --> 00:42:00.547
the leader of North Korea

00:42:04.061 --> 00:42:06.978
has said he's got this nuclear bomb

00:42:08.356 --> 00:42:09.856
and could bomb us,

00:42:11.536 --> 00:42:14.301
and Trump has taunted him,

00:42:14.301 --> 00:42:17.203
really escalating this rhetoric.

00:42:17.203 --> 00:42:21.962
And meanwhile, Rex Tillerson,
the Secretary of State,

00:42:21.962 --> 00:42:25.284
has said well we're beginning talks,

00:42:25.284 --> 00:42:29.451
and Trump says no, he's
wasting his breath, no talks.

00:42:31.414 --> 00:42:34.331
And you think the man's irrational.

00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:39.517
This makes no sense, this
is his Secretary of State.

00:42:39.517 --> 00:42:43.790
Either he's not in any
communication with him,

00:42:43.790 --> 00:42:47.734
or maybe there are two
channels of communication,

00:42:47.734 --> 00:42:49.939
people are confused, it seems irrational.

00:42:49.939 --> 00:42:54.007
Well yes, on the one hand,
this is very dangerous.

00:42:54.007 --> 00:42:56.654
But on the other hand,

00:42:56.654 --> 00:43:00.071
is he trying to just keep us all anxious?

00:43:01.157 --> 00:43:05.324
Just to keep everybody in doubt
as to what's gonna happen,

00:43:09.541 --> 00:43:13.624
oriented towards him as
the author of our future,

00:43:15.067 --> 00:43:16.902
and kind of hyping up.

00:43:16.902 --> 00:43:21.069
Is that what he intends, and
what purpose does that fulfill?

00:43:23.560 --> 00:43:27.093
I think that's the way we need to think.

00:43:27.093 --> 00:43:29.843
And that any politician of course

00:43:31.652 --> 00:43:35.819
is aware of heightened symbols
and emotional magnetism,

00:43:38.107 --> 00:43:39.645
and plays to those symbols,

00:43:39.645 --> 00:43:43.812
and certainly we have a man
who's doing this expertly.

00:43:48.423 --> 00:43:51.902
But that's, I think, the
way we need to think.

00:43:51.902 --> 00:43:55.361
We need to look for emotional logics,

00:43:55.361 --> 00:43:58.361
and stop trying to look for patterns

00:43:59.545 --> 00:44:01.031
of a more rational sort.

00:44:01.031 --> 00:44:03.864
- And what's interesting is that

00:44:03.864 --> 00:44:06.614
your book gives us the landscape,

00:44:11.062 --> 00:44:13.729
the topography of the far right,

00:44:16.101 --> 00:44:19.184
and the right's, emotional landscape,

00:44:22.138 --> 00:44:24.221
I guess we would call it.

00:44:25.618 --> 00:44:27.535
And once you know that,

00:44:29.034 --> 00:44:32.446
then you're able, one is
able, the reader is able,

00:44:32.446 --> 00:44:34.607
to look at Trump differently.

00:44:34.607 --> 00:44:36.952
Not necessarily like him,

00:44:36.952 --> 00:44:41.119
so then the whole business of
dismantling the Obama state,

00:44:43.593 --> 00:44:47.010
the whole business of making cultural war

00:44:48.465 --> 00:44:51.382
to arouse emotions against the NFL,

00:44:52.324 --> 00:44:55.407
begins to represent a political logic

00:44:57.845 --> 00:45:01.051
that comes from an understanding
of the emotional system.

00:45:01.051 --> 00:45:03.191
- Exactly, exactly.

00:45:03.191 --> 00:45:07.024
On some of the Facebooks
after that NFL event,

00:45:09.460 --> 00:45:11.127
I saw pictures of a,

00:45:14.448 --> 00:45:16.865
this is on the Facebook pages

00:45:17.703 --> 00:45:21.120
of some of the people that I write about,

00:45:22.510 --> 00:45:26.677
a picture on one hand of
a group of white soldiers,

00:45:29.081 --> 00:45:33.248
and underneath it, serving
our country, $30,000 a year.

00:45:34.747 --> 00:45:38.833
And then NFL, none of
them served our country,

00:45:38.833 --> 00:45:43.000
and multimillionaires, 40
million a year and so on.

00:45:45.134 --> 00:45:46.519
Envy.

00:45:46.519 --> 00:45:50.019
Gosh, line-cutter, that's what it goes to.

00:45:53.532 --> 00:45:57.247
- So if we call the
people you study rednecks,

00:45:57.247 --> 00:45:59.080
and boobs or whatever,

00:46:00.637 --> 00:46:04.631
then we deny ourselves an understanding

00:46:04.631 --> 00:46:07.116
of their emotional system.

00:46:07.116 --> 00:46:10.204
And understanding their emotional system

00:46:10.204 --> 00:46:13.621
is key to understand what Trump is up to,

00:46:15.985 --> 00:46:18.841
basically, and who he's appealing to.

00:46:18.841 --> 00:46:21.140
- Yes, that's right, that's right.

00:46:21.140 --> 00:46:24.126
And understanding where
the conversation is.

00:46:24.126 --> 00:46:28.209
It's not that where I was
in southwest Louisiana,

00:46:32.108 --> 00:46:35.690
it wasn't this that or the
other Tea Party Trump lover,

00:46:35.690 --> 00:46:39.335
everybody, the public conversation,

00:46:39.335 --> 00:46:41.502
was very much agreed upon.

00:46:43.281 --> 00:46:47.364
And it made me feel that
on the question of race,

00:46:49.250 --> 00:46:53.417
the kinds of issues that came
up routinely in the 1960s

00:46:54.913 --> 00:46:59.080
on the coasts, kind of was
put on stop in the South.

00:47:01.627 --> 00:47:03.710
I'll give you an example.

00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:07.501
One man I was talking with

00:47:07.501 --> 00:47:10.834
said well you know I'm a reformed bigot.

00:47:13.814 --> 00:47:15.442
And I said, well what's a bigot?

00:47:15.442 --> 00:47:17.973
Well, a bigot is someone who hates blacks,

00:47:17.973 --> 00:47:20.690
I never hated blacks, or used the N-word,

00:47:20.690 --> 00:47:23.962
but now I did used to use the N-word,

00:47:23.962 --> 00:47:26.008
they did, I did too.

00:47:26.008 --> 00:47:27.930
But now it offends me,

00:47:27.930 --> 00:47:31.162
someone uses that word on
my Facebook, unfriend them.

00:47:31.162 --> 00:47:32.662
So reformed bigot.

00:47:33.900 --> 00:47:37.037
And I asked him, so in
a very narrow definition

00:47:37.037 --> 00:47:40.037
of what a bigot was, or what racism,

00:47:41.240 --> 00:47:45.407
didn't have any notion of
a system, something larger.

00:47:48.363 --> 00:47:50.455
And I asked him, what was it like

00:47:50.455 --> 00:47:53.538
when your high school was integrated?

00:47:54.963 --> 00:47:56.546
Donelsonville High,

00:47:58.306 --> 00:48:00.559
this is on what we now call Cancer Alley

00:48:00.559 --> 00:48:02.904
in the lower loops of the Mississippi.

00:48:02.904 --> 00:48:04.111
And he said well,

00:48:04.111 --> 00:48:06.875
in my freshman year there
were two blacks in my class,

00:48:06.875 --> 00:48:10.958
and by my senior year half
the class were blacks.

00:48:13.653 --> 00:48:15.653
And we were out fishing.

00:48:17.626 --> 00:48:19.524
And I asked him,

00:48:19.524 --> 00:48:22.191
so did you make any new friends?

00:48:25.961 --> 00:48:28.211
And there was a long pause.

00:48:30.170 --> 00:48:31.170
And he said,

00:48:32.045 --> 00:48:33.962
you're making me think.

00:48:36.243 --> 00:48:39.243
And I thought, I'm making you think?

00:48:40.284 --> 00:48:43.931
This is something you
haven't thought before,

00:48:43.931 --> 00:48:46.181
these could be new friends?

00:48:51.828 --> 00:48:53.315
And I felt like the conversation

00:48:53.315 --> 00:48:56.554
that was going on on the
coast was really on pause.

00:48:56.554 --> 00:49:00.117
And there are things
that just haven't been

00:49:00.117 --> 00:49:03.534
considered and discussed in a respectful,

00:49:04.530 --> 00:49:06.030
mind-changing way.

00:49:07.781 --> 00:49:11.448
Only in a attack-defend
confrontational way.

00:49:14.161 --> 00:49:17.161
And there's a job to be done.

00:49:17.161 --> 00:49:19.161
Speaking of the teacher.

00:49:20.041 --> 00:49:22.107
- We're coming to the end of our program,

00:49:22.107 --> 00:49:23.617
and there's just so much to cover.

00:49:23.617 --> 00:49:26.636
So everybody has to just
go out and read the book,

00:49:26.636 --> 00:49:28.679
because we can't cover everything.

00:49:28.679 --> 00:49:31.790
But one really final
question, which is this.

00:49:31.790 --> 00:49:34.851
In a way you were the liberal community's

00:49:34.851 --> 00:49:39.018
unappointed secret envoy
to the heart of Louisiana.

00:49:41.032 --> 00:49:44.259
And what comes to mind
is President Roosevelt

00:49:44.259 --> 00:49:46.926
sending Harry Hopkins to Russia.

00:49:48.532 --> 00:49:52.199
So I guess the question
is, beyond the book,

00:49:53.803 --> 00:49:56.720
what is the message, in a nutshell,

00:50:00.327 --> 00:50:03.494
about how the liberal community should

00:50:05.134 --> 00:50:07.634
turn your insights into action

00:50:08.913 --> 00:50:11.984
that might bring the country together?

00:50:11.984 --> 00:50:13.734
- Wonderful question.

00:50:15.188 --> 00:50:17.857
And incidentally, there
were liberals of course

00:50:17.857 --> 00:50:20.970
in Louisiana doing wonderful work.

00:50:20.970 --> 00:50:24.801
They were in a minority, but
they were certainly present.

00:50:24.801 --> 00:50:28.606
There is something
called a bridge movement.

00:50:28.606 --> 00:50:31.953
And if you were to Google
the Bridge Alliance,

00:50:31.953 --> 00:50:33.925
you would find it's an umbrella group

00:50:33.925 --> 00:50:36.592
describing some 70, it's now 80,

00:50:37.619 --> 00:50:39.859
different grassroots organizations

00:50:39.859 --> 00:50:42.890
with names like Hi From The Other Side,

00:50:42.890 --> 00:50:45.307
or Living Room Conversations.

00:50:46.419 --> 00:50:50.086
Groups that are trying
to bridge the divide.

00:50:52.149 --> 00:50:55.008
Not that people are gonna
morph into each other,

00:50:55.008 --> 00:50:57.657
and we're not talking about that.

00:50:57.657 --> 00:51:01.210
But in search of particular issues

00:51:01.210 --> 00:51:04.066
on which there can be common ground.

00:51:04.066 --> 00:51:06.760
And right here at Berkeley
there is Berkeley Bridge.

00:51:06.760 --> 00:51:09.055
I'm in touch with some fantastic students

00:51:09.055 --> 00:51:11.102
that are doing this.

00:51:11.102 --> 00:51:13.519
We need to get debates going.

00:51:14.469 --> 00:51:19.062
The whole Berkeley culture
needs to be enriched

00:51:19.062 --> 00:51:22.979
so that talking across
this divide isn't scary,

00:51:24.918 --> 00:51:28.001
isn't repugnant, isn't attack-defend,

00:51:29.004 --> 00:51:31.671
but it's really exploring ideas.

00:51:32.975 --> 00:51:36.708
And I think this can be
done in a lot of ways,

00:51:36.708 --> 00:51:40.288
theater, satire, lots of different ways.

00:51:40.288 --> 00:51:43.371
I think that culture on the UC campus

00:51:44.330 --> 00:51:46.350
has become atrophied,

00:51:46.350 --> 00:51:50.761
and I think we need to
beef it up, enrich it.

00:51:50.761 --> 00:51:53.850
And the Bridge Movement
is really all about that.

00:51:53.850 --> 00:51:57.267
I found a lot of crossover on such issues

00:51:59.051 --> 00:52:02.139
as reducing prison populations,

00:52:02.139 --> 00:52:04.639
getting money out of politics.

00:52:06.180 --> 00:52:08.513
In fact, reducing pollution.

00:52:11.271 --> 00:52:12.688
Renewable energy.

00:52:13.563 --> 00:52:16.675
There's something called
the Green Tea Movement,

00:52:16.675 --> 00:52:20.842
where Tea Party people are
embracing solar and so on.

00:52:21.899 --> 00:52:24.031
Protecting children.

00:52:24.031 --> 00:52:25.364
There's actually

00:52:29.725 --> 00:52:32.225
quite a lot we could agree on.

00:52:33.300 --> 00:52:38.057
Including being proud of
America, quite basically.

00:52:38.057 --> 00:52:41.961
We may mean different
things about being American,

00:52:41.961 --> 00:52:46.164
and patriotism, but we need to
learn to stretch our symbols,

00:52:46.164 --> 00:52:49.508
not to step over and deride them,

00:52:49.508 --> 00:52:52.258
but to learn how to stretch them,

00:52:53.218 --> 00:52:56.540
how to apply a value to circumstances

00:52:56.540 --> 00:52:59.794
that the person may
not have thought about.

00:52:59.794 --> 00:53:01.742
You say you're a patriot, great,

00:53:01.742 --> 00:53:03.533
so does that mean sacrificing,

00:53:03.533 --> 00:53:07.225
willingness to sacrifice for your country?

00:53:07.225 --> 00:53:09.058
That's what most people I talked to

00:53:09.058 --> 00:53:12.217
felt about the flag and the constitution,

00:53:12.217 --> 00:53:15.421
or does it also mean
defending the free press?

00:53:15.421 --> 00:53:17.088
So symbol stretches.

00:53:18.138 --> 00:53:21.041
- I have one final question,

00:53:21.041 --> 00:53:23.084
and I'm looking for a brief answer.

00:53:23.084 --> 00:53:26.312
Is there something that
Trump is doing as president

00:53:26.312 --> 00:53:30.395
that would alienate the
people that you observed?

00:53:41.609 --> 00:53:43.750
- They're sticking with
him, they're loyal.

00:53:43.750 --> 00:53:47.720
They're not excited about him anymore,

00:53:47.720 --> 00:53:51.970
but they don't see anything else for them.

00:53:51.970 --> 00:53:54.361
I started with a red state paradox,

00:53:54.361 --> 00:53:57.055
but I end with a blue state paradox.

00:53:57.055 --> 00:54:00.050
How could it be that the Democratic Party,

00:54:00.050 --> 00:54:02.897
the party of the working man and woman

00:54:02.897 --> 00:54:06.814
isn't appealing to these
working men and women?

00:54:08.981 --> 00:54:12.417
That's the work that needs to be done.

00:54:12.417 --> 00:54:14.182
- Well on that note, Arlie,

00:54:14.182 --> 00:54:16.295
I can't recommend your book enough

00:54:16.295 --> 00:54:19.878
for people on the left
side of the spectrum

00:54:21.775 --> 00:54:25.856
to become informed about the right side.

00:54:25.856 --> 00:54:29.623
So thank you very much
for coming on our program,

00:54:29.623 --> 00:54:32.061
and thank you very much
for writing this book.

00:54:32.061 --> 00:54:35.637
- Thank you very much, honored to be here.

00:54:35.637 --> 00:54:37.421
- And thank you very much

00:54:37.421 --> 00:54:41.588
for joining us for this
Conversation With History.
