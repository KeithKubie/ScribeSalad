00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:03.969
&gt;&gt; Gayathri Rajan: Hello everyone.

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:10.550
Welcome and thank you for coming to, to meet
Leymah Gbowee.

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:16.280
Before she comes on stage we have, I will,
I'll be showing you a video.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.259
[sound of helicopter]
[low music]

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:25.839
&gt;&gt;Leymah Gbowee: Money, greed, ethnicity,
absolute power.

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:36.271
There is nothing that should make people do
what they did to the children of Liberia.

00:00:36.271 --> 00:00:37.271
[music/singing in African language starts]

00:00:37.271 --> 00:00:43.040
&gt;&gt;Leymah Gbowee: The warlords would give these
boys guns and send them off.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.610
&gt;&gt;female #1: They'd just do anything because
they had guns.

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.950
&gt;&gt;Leymah Gbowee: You go to bed saying, "God,
please what do we do?"

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:55.710
The women of Liberia want peace.

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.040
Now.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:02.430
I had a dream.

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.290
And it was like a crazy dream.

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.500
We decided to protest.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:16.980
[electronic music with vocals] We wore the
white, saying to people we were out for peace.

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:22.040
Thousands of women, Muslim and Christian,
were coming together from different walks

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.040
of life.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:34.190
These women had seen the worst, but they still
had that vibrance for life.

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:42.460
&gt;&gt;female #2: And we said, well, if I should
get killed, just remember me that I was fighting

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.400
for peace.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.790
[gunshot]
[drums]

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:57.120
&gt;&gt;Leymah Gbowee: We stepped out first and
did the unimaginable.

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:05.920
To send out a signal to the world that we
the Liberian women, we are tired of the killing

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.630
of our people.

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.579
We can do it again if we want to.

00:02:10.579 --> 00:02:12.709
[music/singing ends]

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.889
&gt;&gt; Gayathri Rajan: That's a quick introduction.

00:02:16.889 --> 00:02:19.730
This is just a tease.

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.579
I would encourage everyone to go see the movie,
Pray the Devil Back to Hell.

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:31.560
It's an award-winning documentary about, about
this mission and the central figure is Leymah.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.120
So just a few words on Leymah.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.609
She was born in Liberia and was only 17 when
the Second Liberian Civil War erupted.

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:47.560
This was a very brutal conflict and it tore
apart her life and claimed the lives of many

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.170
of her family and friends.

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.220
And the years of fighting had destroyed her
country, remember, this was the second civil

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.079
war, there was a first one before that, and
her hopes and dreams.

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:03.830
As a young mother trapped in a nightmare of
domestic abuse, she found the courage to turn

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:10.840
her bitterness into action, realizing that
it is women who suffer most during conflict

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:16.150
and that the power of women working together
can create an unstoppable force.

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:23.150
Working as a social worker and a trauma counselor
during the war, she organized the Women of

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:28.540
Liberia Mass Action for Peace, which was a
multi-cultural and a multi-religious group,

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:34.540
it included Christians as well as Muslims
in Liberia, who prayed for peace, held nonviolent

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:40.280
protests, including a sex strike [laughing],
which resulted in a promise from President

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.260
Charles Taylor to attend peace talks in Ghana.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.400
This group was critical in bringing an end
to the civil war in 2003 and the election

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:56.180
of Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf in Liberia, she is
the first African female president.

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:03.620
In 2007 Leymah was awarded the Blue Ribbon
for Peace from the John F. Kennedy School

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:09.419
of Government at Harvard and she's also co-founder
and Executive Director of Women Peace and

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:15.129
Security Network in Africa, this is an organization
dedicated to training women, advocating for

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:18.530
peace and security in African governance.

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:23.550
If all this was not enough, she's also the
author of Mighty Be Our Powers.

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:29.190
The book is, is for sale for $10 outside and
I would recommend, I would encourage you if

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.180
you are interested in reading more about her,
her history, her personal history as well

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:39.440
as her political actions to have it signed
personally by Leymah herself.

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:46.690
And she's also, as, as we just saw, a central
figure in, in the movie.

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:55.830
So it brings us all great joy and it's a special
privilege to have someone of her stature and,

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.250
and her, her impact come to talk to us.

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:00.250
Welcome Leymah.

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:01.250
[applause]

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:02.250
&gt;&gt;Megan Smith: Ok.

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:07.169
Can you guys hear us?

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:09.289
Hello.

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:15.629
Thank you, Gayathri.

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:19.479
Leymah, it's amazing to have you here.

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:22.610
&gt;&gt;Leymah Gbowee: Well, it's amazing to be
here, I'm just overwhelmed.

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:29.919
I'm not one to get blown away by America and
the sight of things, but Google has just really

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:32.430
blown me out of my whatever.

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:33.430
[laughter]

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:37.009
&gt;&gt;Megan Smith: We hope we can be helpful.

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:38.860
&gt;&gt;Leymah Gbowee: Well it is.

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:40.400
&gt;&gt;Megan Smith: Good.

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:41.470
You've done extraordinary things.

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:47.910
There's a, I mean the people who've written,
not only your book is incredible, Mighty Be

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:52.889
Our Powers, but just looking at some of the
comments in the back and the one I just wanted

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:59.879
to call out Archbishop Tutu's quote and he
says, "Mighty Be Our Powers reminds us that

00:05:59.879 --> 00:06:04.289
even in the worst of times, humanity's best
can shine through."

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:12.900
And there's this, as you in your sort of entry
into the, into the book here, the prologue,

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:17.590
you point out that whenever we're looking
at war, you know, we're always seeing the

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:24.360
fighters and we're seeing, you know, these
different leaders arguing and in the background

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:29.639
are often the women and the children and all
the innocent bystanders.

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:36.830
And you somehow figured out how to bring them
right to the front and work together to do

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:38.889
that, which is extraordinary.

00:06:38.889 --> 00:06:43.370
But before we get there, I wanted to start
earlier, you know, not that many people are

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:47.620
familiar with Liberia in detail and, and how
you know some of these conflicts started and

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:52.130
what happened and also I love the beginning
of your book because you start it at a peaceful

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:53.130
time.

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:54.130
&gt;&gt;Leymah Gbowee: Yeah.

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:58.810
&gt;&gt;Megan Smith: With your family and your parents,
and who are just sound extraordinary and,

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:01.099
and so could you talk a little bit about that
time?

00:07:01.099 --> 00:07:08.509
&gt;&gt;Leymah Gbowee: Well, first, besides being
blown away by Google, Google, I'm happy to

00:07:08.509 --> 00:07:09.509
be here.

00:07:09.509 --> 00:07:10.509
I'm really honored.

00:07:10.509 --> 00:07:15.729
I've been sending text messages to my partner,
who's a tech person, to say you're really

00:07:15.729 --> 00:07:18.689
missing, because this is heavenly.

00:07:18.689 --> 00:07:19.900
[laughter]

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:27.840
&gt;&gt;Leymah Gbowee: We grew, I grew up in Liberia
and Liberia is a country that many commentators

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:35.900
of history will tell you the history of Liberia
in itself is conflict.

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:43.280
The history of Liberia starts from 1822 at
the arrival of the free slaves from America.

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:49.689
There is nothing before about the indigenous
people who lived there.

00:07:49.689 --> 00:07:57.249
So you hear from the beginning any book you
read, Liberia was founded in 1822.

00:07:57.249 --> 00:08:02.360
Indigenous people are not resistant to say,
so what happened to us?

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:04.689
Who welcomed the free slaves?

00:08:04.689 --> 00:08:09.819
When the free slaves came to Liberia, and
if you've ever been to any African culture,

00:08:09.819 --> 00:08:15.060
you notice that people would get out of their
beds to give the strangers, sort of give you

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:20.580
the best part of the food, the best place
to sleep, so they give them the best land

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:22.719
and everything.

00:08:22.719 --> 00:08:27.389
What happened in Liberia was what happened
on the plantation.

00:08:27.389 --> 00:08:33.380
Many of those who came had never understood
or knew anything about living peacefully.

00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:42.251
So in a short period we had segregated schools,
we had segregated worship places and if you

00:08:42.251 --> 00:08:47.770
had a last name like my last name, you could
not go to the university, so they figured

00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:52.490
out how to suppress and oppress the indigenous
people.

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:57.300
Liberia gained her independence in 1847.

00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:04.350
Indigenous people were not allowed to vote
until 1957.

00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:11.280
So if you go back to the history of the black
people here, it Liberia is a mirror image

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:16.260
of everything that happened in the South on
the plantation, it happened to our people

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:17.470
back home.

00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:22.380
So for many years people felt cheated, indigenous
people felt cheated.

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:23.620
They were angry.

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:29.620
It built up and built up until the 1980s and
there was a coup.

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:34.720
And then an indigenous soldier became the
president of Liberia.

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:43.350
In support, or to show the power of the indigenous
people, he took 13 of the most powerful descendants

00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:47.160
of free slaves and publicly executed them.

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:53.780
So if you go on YouTube you still find images
of the execution of those men.

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:59.090
So whole droves of descendants and relatives
of them moved out of Liberia.

00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:02.690
Their properties were seized, it became chaos.

00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:09.800
And then in 1989 Taylor started the war.

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:18.230
And the war was funded by free slaves' descendants
in America who felt like we need to revenge

00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:20.460
what happened to our people in 1980.

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:26.190
So in Liberia when we the war ended in 2003
and they were talking about TRC, the Truth

00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:32.160
and Reconciliation Commission, the conversation
was, where do we start talking about the atrocities?

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:34.730
And they started from 1979.

00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:40.930
And people felt like we need to go back to
1822 and start that conversation because that's

00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:42.950
where everything started from.

00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:48.940
So complicated history, complicated place,
we never really had our own identity as a

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:49.940
people.

00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:52.350
Our constitution is modeled after the U.S.
government.

00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:56.240
Our flag is like the American flag except
for one star.

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:59.840
Our capital city is named after former President
James Monroe.

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:04.830
We call our money the Liberian dollar, but
it's used simultaneously, side by side with

00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:05.840
the U.S. dollar.

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:10.240
If you have the U.S. dollar it's even better
for you.

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:13.090
Everything, we have three branches of government.

00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:20.800
So to sum it up, someone who did a documentary
calls Liberia America's step child.

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:24.830
&gt;&gt;Megan Smith: That's very interesting.

00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:30.400
[audience chuckles] It's an amazing history
and I think for you personally in the book

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:35.120
you, you basically are talking about some
of this history and then you come to a point

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:44.370
it's really the, your grad, high school graduation
and you have a wonderful story about the community

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:49.528
at that time and your father, your mother,
and I wonder if you could talk a little bit

00:11:49.528 --> 00:11:50.528
about them.

00:11:50.528 --> 00:11:53.440
And you have three words, community, connection,
confidence.

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:55.010
Big plans.

00:11:55.010 --> 00:12:01.760
&gt;&gt;Leymah Gbowee: Growing up we, my parents
are both from indigenous background and they

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:02.760
struggled.

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:12.780
They really had serious struggles with my
dad has a very pathetic childhood story.

00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:18.660
His mother gave birth to six children and
every time she gave birth, the child would

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:19.660
die.

00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:24.000
And he, when they had him, they were a set
of twin.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:29.580
His, the other twin died and the community
got together and took him from his mother

00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:35.220
and they named her a witch, so she was banished.

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:38.010
She could not play or interact with him.

00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:43.780
So he tells stories of growing up in a community,
being taken care of community women and looking

00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:48.580
at his mother but never really reaching out
to her because it wasn't allowed.

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:53.200
And later on he was given to live with the
missionaries.

00:12:53.200 --> 00:13:00.220
My mother lived with her father, who was a
big agriculturist, agriculturist, he had a

00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:01.220
farm.

00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:02.460
He was wealthy.

00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:05.020
When his wife divorced him, my mother is an
only child.

00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:06.800
My father is an only child.

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:12.590
When his wife divorced him he slumped into
depression, she became a child of the community

00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:13.590
also.

00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:19.850
So both of them tell horror stories of growing
up without their parents, growing up in pains,

00:13:19.850 --> 00:13:23.130
and when they got together, I think maybe
that was the connection for their love, I

00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:26.740
never really asked them, but she said my dad
was a sweet talker.

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:27.740
[laughter]

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:31.110
&gt;&gt;Leymah Gbowee: They got together and they
really struggled.

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:36.240
They started having us at, my mother was 17
when she had her first child and then one

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:38.130
after the other we came.

00:13:38.130 --> 00:13:39.640
Five girls, no boy.

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:47.480
We, so they tried to really provide us the
kind of family life that they never encountered.

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:50.550
So we lived in a close community.

00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:57.530
My mother, my grandmother, who is actually
my grand aunt, well she took care of all of

00:13:57.530 --> 00:14:03.730
us and then with different ethnic groups it
was a so-called middle class community at

00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:10.330
the time, but it was a poor community if you
comp-, but the richness of that community

00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:14.100
was the sense of community, the sense of connection.

00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:20.070
You could go to the next neighbor's house,
eat and if it was 7 p.m. as a child, no one

00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:21.950
sent you back home dirty.

00:14:21.950 --> 00:14:24.480
You took your bath there and they brought
you home.

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:26.800
They would spoil you at that house.

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:29.830
But if you also misbehaved, they would spank
you there.

00:14:29.830 --> 00:14:33.470
[audience chuckles] You dare not come back
home and say, "I got spanked" because you

00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:34.470
get spanked again.

00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:35.470
[laughter]

00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:38.380
&gt;&gt;Leymah Gbowee: So we grew up with that kind
of community.

00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:45.510
No one, I never knew that my colleagues had
a different ethnicity, even though they spoke

00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:47.300
different languages, but it didn't matter.

00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:55.460
It was not until the war came, so I grew up
really in a comfortable, loving environment.

00:14:55.460 --> 00:15:03.280
So today my, when I go into any of my childhood
friends' home, those who were Muslims, they

00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:08.450
knew exactly what kind of new, when it was
Ramadan we used to cry that we didn't have

00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:13.340
new dresses to put on because then my mother
would really find it hard to explain that

00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:18.450
we are not Muslims and you can't, for us it
wasn't important, every other child was wearing

00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:22.700
something new, so we wore new clothes during
the Ramadan and the Muslim children wore new

00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:28.491
clothes during the Christmas, that was the
kind of community we grew up in.

00:15:28.491 --> 00:15:30.570
We had street fights.

00:15:30.570 --> 00:15:33.230
We, we would fight with the boys.

00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:37.950
We would do different things, but if you read
the first part of my book you will see that

00:15:37.950 --> 00:15:39.500
it was just a lovely place.

00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:42.600
&gt;&gt;Megan Smith: A place we hope all children
can grow.

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:44.220
&gt;&gt;Leymah Gbowee: Can grow up.

00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:49.220
And my parents were the kind of people with
all of their problems and if you explain their

00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:55.190
marriage within the European/Western context,
people will be sick, so don't even go there,

00:15:55.190 --> 00:16:00.500
[people chuckle] because they have their complicated
relationship, but they've managed to stay

00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:04.300
together for over 40 years.

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:05.800
So they're still married, they never divorced.

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:11.840
And I think, I, in some way they love each
other, you know?

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:12.840
[laughter]

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:17.570
&gt;&gt;Megan Smith: That's an incredible story.

00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:21.040
So shortly after the graduation things began,
you were 17 or so.

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:23.280
&gt;&gt;Leymah Gbowee: I went to university.

00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:24.720
I was super smart.

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:29.910
I, my, my major was chemistry and minor in
zoology.

00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:31.890
I was going to medical school.

00:16:31.890 --> 00:16:33.740
I was going to become a pediatrician.

00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:40.611
I, it, life was there for the taking and every
day I went to school and then I think it was

00:16:40.611 --> 00:16:46.680
we started in March and by July it ended.

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:53.030
We woke up one morning, my mother drove off
to work with my oldest sister, my other sister

00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:57.750
had spent the night because we had graduated,
so you could have boyfriends now, so she spent

00:16:57.750 --> 00:17:04.659
the night with her boyfriend, but I remember
that I was the only older child of my parents

00:17:04.659 --> 00:17:07.980
at home, because I had an afternoon class.

00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:09.270
So I was waiting till 2:00.

00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:16.900
By 10:00 in the morning, the shooting erupted
and this is where I say that was the moment,

00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:25.640
from 8:00 that morning I was a child asking
my mother for cash, by 10:00 I was an adult,

00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:34.250
adult taking care of almost 25 people, including
some very young children for a week.

00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:37.740
My mother, my father, my siblings never came
back home for almost a week.

00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:43.550
When my mother came back she was so traumatized,
she just told me, "Carry on."

00:17:43.550 --> 00:17:47.240
And I had, I continue to carry on till today.

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:54.120
&gt;&gt;Megan Smith: Can you tell a little bit about
the, there was a story you told in New York

00:17:54.120 --> 00:18:00.120
that I heard you talk about when you guys,
when you left and some of the community, bringing

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:04.700
the community with you and especially the,
the teenage boys and how teenage boys are

00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:08.290
treated and what was going on with sort of
that group of.

00:18:08.290 --> 00:18:16.420
&gt;&gt;Leymah Gbowee: In 1996, I, I was with my
kids' father and he wasn't the best love.

00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:19.270
So for weeks he wasn't around.

00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:20.810
And the comm--

00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:22.550
&gt;&gt;Megan Smith: At this time you had your older
son, how many children?

00:18:22.550 --> 00:18:25.610
&gt;&gt;Leymah Gbowee: I have two and a half.

00:18:25.610 --> 00:18:26.870
&gt;&gt;Megan Smith: Ok.

00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:28.500
&gt;&gt;Leymah Gbowee: Because I was pregnant.

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:29.500
[laughter]

00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:30.500
&gt;&gt;Megan Smith: Leymah has six children.

00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:31.500
&gt;&gt;Leymah Gbowee: Yes.

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:34.020
&gt;&gt;Megan Smith: The oldest is, is 18 and in
university here in the U.S. and the youngest

00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:36.850
is 2, beautiful little girl, we just [inaudible]

00:18:36.850 --> 00:18:41.170
&gt;&gt;Leymah Gbowee: So we, we woke up that morning,
but the night before where I live I live in

00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:42.170
my parents' house.

00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:44.510
I had moved back to my childhood neighborhood.

00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:47.830
That's where I was having my children.

00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:50.810
And I lived in that house with my uncle, my
aunt.

00:18:50.810 --> 00:18:58.520
They had three children and I had my two children,
so we were there and my cousins, group of

00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:02.350
boys, and all of their friends live in the
back in a little outhouse.

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:07.890
That, the night before they kept arguing that
oh, there will be no war, there'll be no war,

00:19:07.890 --> 00:19:08.890
there'll be no war.

00:19:08.890 --> 00:19:14.020
And I kept saying to them, tomorrow there's
definitely going to be war, because there

00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:17.910
were too many tensions between the warring
leaders in Monrovia.

00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:21.090
The next morning shooting started.

00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:22.910
So everyone ran.

00:19:22.910 --> 00:19:28.660
People were taking their children and by the
time, by that night somehow, my stray husband

00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:31.850
came back and he slept at home.

00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:36.530
So when the morning started, the shooting
started, we couldn't decide where we wanted

00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:43.150
to go, how, because the bullets were raining
down like thunder on the house, that we started

00:19:43.150 --> 00:19:49.760
to see bullets enter the house, so at some
point we decided we have to leave.

00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:55.990
So we take the children, run out of the back
door and as we're leaving I see these four

00:19:55.990 --> 00:19:59.290
young men from the neighborhood, standing.

00:19:59.290 --> 00:20:02.520
And then I say, "I thought you people left
all along."

00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:06.210
And they said no, they call me Leymos, so
if you went on the [Liberian word ] and asked

00:20:06.210 --> 00:20:09.830
for Leymah you would not get, it's Leymos,
that's my street name.

00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:15.690
They said, "Leymos, we were waiting for you
because we didn't know if the children's father

00:20:15.690 --> 00:20:19.480
had come and we want to help you to carry
the children."

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:23.930
So they took the two children and we started
walking going.

00:20:23.930 --> 00:20:24.930
I was in my nightgown.

00:20:24.930 --> 00:20:33.830
We got to a checkpoint and the boy who was
carrying my son was pulled off the line and

00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:39.380
then my children's father took my son and
started going.

00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:40.380
And I stood up.

00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:42.280
Then he said, "Leymah, walk."

00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:44.090
And I said, "No.

00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:46.950
Because if I leave here, he's going to be
killed."

00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:49.360
Because by that time they were interrogating
him.

00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:52.010
"We saw you on the airfield.

00:20:52.010 --> 00:20:57.242
We saw you and you are a fighter; you were
with the opposing fighting forces" and then

00:20:57.242 --> 00:21:02.210
I walked up to them and said, "If you saw
him on the airfield, that's not a lie.

00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:03.210
That's where we live."

00:21:03.210 --> 00:21:04.320
We said, "Well, we saw him."

00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:09.130
He said because, I said, "Where they live
there is no toilet so they go on the open

00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:12.860
field to ease themselves and he probably went
there this morning."

00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:17.790
So we just had an argument and he was there
really upset, "You want to die, I'm not going

00:21:17.790 --> 00:21:19.660
to stay here to die with you."

00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:25.620
He walk away, so I stayed there, we argue
it out and they told me "take him".

00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:31.700
So the boy and I walked and went to my parents'
house and he stayed at my parents' house for

00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:32.700
many years.

00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:41.330
But one of the beauty of living with those
young people, fast forward, 2006 these are

00:21:41.330 --> 00:21:47.940
boys who cannot afford food to eat and the
reason why we have such close connection is

00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:54.240
because every time I made a meal, they had
meal within wait for them in my house.

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:57.680
My sister died in 2006 in Ghana.

00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:04.320
I came home with the body and we moved back
because that's where my parents had come back

00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:09.730
so we go and come back to that same community
and we were putting when people were coming

00:22:09.730 --> 00:22:14.300
every morning women would bring hot water
as for our tradition, because when you're

00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:16.180
mourning you can't do anything.

00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:19.140
People will come to cook, people will eat,
they will come and sing.

00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:23.980
And this day I'm sitting outside, two days
before the funeral.

00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:28.400
And those boys come with 1,500 Liberian dollars.

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:35.910
That's a lot of money for those group of people
who cannot even find it to eat.

00:22:35.910 --> 00:22:40.740
And they said to me, "Leymos, this is our
contribution to the funeral."

00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:44.370
Till I grow old I will never forget.

00:22:44.370 --> 00:22:47.710
So when you talk about community, connections.

00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:55.840
If I, if you become say President of Liberia,
that community I, I don't live in that community

00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:58.470
anymore, but that's the community I register
to vote in.

00:22:58.470 --> 00:23:00.480
&gt;&gt;Megan Smith: Nice.

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:01.480
[laughter]

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:03.170
&gt;&gt;Megan Smith: Fabulous.

00:23:03.170 --> 00:23:08.059
So the world has really fallen apart and one
of the insights that you had, key insights,

00:23:08.059 --> 00:23:10.700
was about the mothers.

00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:16.320
Interestingly we had a conference recently
at Google with former radical violent extremists

00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:21.120
who have transformed their lives and they
are now working for peace and from every continent

00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:26.030
and the U.S. and one of the themes that almost
everyone said that at some point, for them,

00:23:26.030 --> 00:23:31.650
whether they had been a White Supremacist,
or an Al Qaeda or they were, you know, in

00:23:31.650 --> 00:23:36.850
the L.A. gangs or the Rio gangs, somehow their
mother, when they wanted to transform, they

00:23:36.850 --> 00:23:41.640
found their mother and they worked with their
mother to come back out and I and so can you

00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:47.900
talk about how you got these insights and
how you got there and then what you did?

00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:54.020
&gt;&gt;Leymah Gbowee: Well, when we, we, we, the
one thing I tell people is that what I saw

00:23:54.020 --> 00:24:00.630
in my mother was what every other mother had
gone through.

00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:04.910
Every morning she took her bath and sat out
looking well.

00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:13.330
But because I was the older one, I knew how
messed up her mind was.

00:24:13.330 --> 00:24:16.730
But she would not cry in public.

00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:24.160
When you have a mother who refuses to change
her clothes for almost three months because

00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:35.880
for her this represents the death of civility,
in my community that I knew to be a civil

00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:37.190
community.

00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:41.600
My mother gave a man about five cups of rice.

00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:49.940
He walked from this distance to that distance
and he encountered the soldiers.

00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:57.450
She standing watching, that for her was the
collapse of her world view of Liberians as

00:24:57.450 --> 00:25:00.520
civil people.

00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:03.690
And the soldiers asked him, who gave you that?

00:25:03.690 --> 00:25:07.890
During the war just a cup of rice was gold
dust.

00:25:07.890 --> 00:25:15.510
He looked back and I think his thought was,
if I say her she'll get killed.

00:25:15.510 --> 00:25:18.620
He said, "No one."

00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:23.280
There, they took a pistol, pop.

00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:27.880
I came back from searching for greens and
my mother is wailing, "I killed a man.

00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:30.490
I killed a man.

00:25:30.490 --> 00:25:33.800
I killed a man."

00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:38.810
For years, she never told that story.

00:25:38.810 --> 00:25:42.940
She just kept going and added on to our group.

00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:46.920
If she saw a child, she's, "Let's take this
one."

00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:53.320
So we were five before the war and then we
were almost 20, people from all over.

00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:57.400
For she never showed the world her pains.

00:25:57.400 --> 00:26:01.130
I had my own pains I was carrying until I
started having my children.

00:26:01.130 --> 00:26:08.210
When I started doing the work with the women
I realized that they too had their pains.

00:26:08.210 --> 00:26:15.820
But the one thing that was for me a, a rev,
a revealing thing that really made me to step

00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:22.060
up the work that I did was, that even in their
pains and their sufferings, these people were

00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:23.760
still keeping society going.

00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:24.870
&gt;&gt;Megan Smith: Right.

00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:27.470
&gt;&gt;Leymah Gbowee: Their communities were still
functioning.

00:26:27.470 --> 00:26:28.770
Their children were still eating.

00:26:28.770 --> 00:26:35.810
They had some kind, a, a form of strength
that we needed to build on.

00:26:35.810 --> 00:26:38.000
A form of energy.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.920
So by the time we started engaging them in
peace work, I didn't have to do anything.

00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:47.590
I can't take credit for anything, because
they had ideas.

00:26:47.590 --> 00:26:49.840
This is what we should do, this is what we
should do.

00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:53.420
They wore me out with their ideas.

00:26:53.420 --> 00:27:01.650
So when we started protesting, for me, I appreciate
Pray the Devil Back to Hell, I appreciate

00:27:01.650 --> 00:27:10.210
this memoir, I appreciate sitting here at
Google, but I never imagined that what we

00:27:10.210 --> 00:27:17.760
did would even be on a screen, let alone me
in this place speaking.

00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:25.240
It wasn't for anything, it was our survival
strategy.

00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:27.670
It was our survival tactic.

00:27:27.670 --> 00:27:34.020
So even till today is almost like a dream
to me coming to all of these places, meeting

00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:39.540
all of you people, because I still feel what
I do and the women in Liberia share that,

00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:41.480
the women in Congo share that.

00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:44.940
What we do in our communities is survival.

00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:47.679
So when we came together we had the energy.

00:27:47.679 --> 00:27:48.940
We protested.

00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:56.490
If you wake up in the morning, you ask an
American, I'm sure all of you have a bank

00:27:56.490 --> 00:28:03.429
account, some have insurance, because you
are certain of your tomorrow.

00:28:03.429 --> 00:28:09.100
We had come to a place where we were not certain
of a tomorrow.

00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:14.900
And when a community get to that place, and
you have children, you start to ask yourself

00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:18.049
what future or is there any future for them?

00:28:18.049 --> 00:28:24.630
We, as mothers, decided we'll put our broken
bodies out there and protest for peace.

00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:28.750
Two years we protested.

00:28:28.750 --> 00:28:34.400
Some days we went to protest and it rained
and when it rained that's when you knew who

00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:40.380
were wearing the most expensive clothes or
the ones who were wearing the cheap ones,

00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:43.670
because the color ran on our legs.

00:28:43.670 --> 00:28:50.220
[audience chuckles] The days we didn't have
money to confront some of our warlords, we

00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:53.610
walked for hours.

00:28:53.610 --> 00:28:58.070
We went to the fighters and we one of the
things till today that those fighters who

00:28:58.070 --> 00:29:02.830
always say, you are people of your word.

00:29:02.830 --> 00:29:09.130
And that's the difference between women, peace
builders, negotiators, because even if it

00:29:09.130 --> 00:29:12.360
would kill them, they would stick to their
word.

00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:17.130
And so when we started engaging the fighters,
especially when disarmament failed in December,

00:29:17.130 --> 00:29:21.290
this, they were telling each other, you can
count on them.

00:29:21.290 --> 00:29:25.240
If they say they are coming back tomorrow,
they will come back.

00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:29.380
So if we woke up the next morning and we had
promised a group of fighters that we were

00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:33.059
coming and we didn't have money for transportation,
we walked.

00:29:33.059 --> 00:29:40.059
But it, like you rightly said, all of those
men, all of those violent offenders, they

00:29:40.059 --> 00:29:44.200
looked back, two things flashed past their
minds.

00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:48.799
Even when we're destroying, these are the
people holding us up.

00:29:48.799 --> 00:29:53.880
Even the gang members after they go out and
do everything they come home, their mothers

00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:54.880
are there.

00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:58.840
And they are the pillar of strength.

00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:01.760
That's the first thing.

00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:10.880
The second thing if I decide to go through
a process of transformation, if no one believes

00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:18.190
that what I'm doing is true or sincere, this
mother will believe me and she's always there

00:30:18.190 --> 00:30:22.710
to give me a second chance, so those are the
things that probably make them come back to

00:30:22.710 --> 00:30:25.320
us and come back to us and come back to us.

00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:30.540
&gt;&gt;Megan Smith: You had that wonderful expression
that your mom used about I'll tie my middle,

00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:33.612
can you say a little bit about that and what
she said?

00:30:33.612 --> 00:30:41.341
&gt;&gt;Leymah Gbowee: My, my life had taken a dip
like many of us and I is nothing that you

00:30:41.341 --> 00:30:42.490
can compare to anyone.

00:30:42.490 --> 00:30:49.070
I was at a place where every time I shook,
a baby dropped.

00:30:49.070 --> 00:30:54.530
It was just terrible and then I was in this
abusive relationship that I had finally gained,

00:30:54.530 --> 00:31:01.300
gotten the courage to step out of, but I slept
all day, I became a bum.

00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:04.310
That's how you call it here, right?

00:31:04.310 --> 00:31:07.610
[audience chuckles] Sleeping, not wanting
to do anything.

00:31:07.610 --> 00:31:08.610
So I was a bum.

00:31:08.610 --> 00:31:09.610
&gt;&gt;Megan Smith: That's depressed.

00:31:09.610 --> 00:31:10.610
&gt;&gt;Leymah Gbowee: On my parents' couch.

00:31:10.610 --> 00:31:20.260
And then this night we were sweeping and she
said, she had my third child on her back and

00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:23.919
I was pregnant with my fourth.

00:31:23.919 --> 00:31:31.880
My dad would call me a baby machine that he
was disappointed in me and he was really disappointed

00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:37.309
because of all of his children I think because
he knew how smart I was, he felt like I was

00:31:37.309 --> 00:31:38.799
going places.

00:31:38.799 --> 00:31:43.770
So when my life just deteriorated to having
children and staying in an abusive relationship,

00:31:43.770 --> 00:31:48.660
he was very bitter and he made some very horrible
comments at me.

00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:54.260
I forgive him now because there is nothing
else I can do, he's dependent on me.

00:31:54.260 --> 00:31:55.260
[laughter]

00:31:55.260 --> 00:31:57.910
&gt;&gt;Megan Smith: Goes back around full circle?

00:31:57.910 --> 00:32:02.110
&gt;&gt;Leymah Gbowee: Well he's old, so I have
to take care of him, that's what I've been

00:32:02.110 --> 00:32:03.110
taught to do.

00:32:03.110 --> 00:32:08.710
And I don't hold anything against him because
by in hindsight having my own children now,

00:32:08.710 --> 00:32:14.020
I would do the same thing, maybe even worse.

00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:15.020
[laughter]

00:32:15.020 --> 00:32:22.110
&gt;&gt;Leymah Gbowee: But this night we're standing
out and we've swept the grass and put it in

00:32:22.110 --> 00:32:29.720
a drum and it's like a bonfire and my mother
asked me, "What do you want to do with your

00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:30.720
life?"

00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:33.290
And she said, "Leymah."

00:32:33.290 --> 00:32:36.640
I say, "Yes, ma'am."

00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:48.390
She say, "If you decide to do anything positive
with your life, I promise you this night I

00:32:48.390 --> 00:32:54.040
will tie my waist and stand by you.

00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:58.799
If you want to go to school, I will take care
of these children.

00:32:58.799 --> 00:33:05.020
If you want to work, I will take care of these
children."

00:33:05.020 --> 00:33:10.049
In essence, she was saying to me, I will be
your pillar of strength.

00:33:10.049 --> 00:33:14.570
Till today as I'm here if I pick the phone
and say to my mom, "Go to the U.S. Embassy,

00:33:14.570 --> 00:33:21.990
they will give you your visa, I need you in
San Francisco" she drops everything and comes.

00:33:21.990 --> 00:33:27.180
It's not, my dad says, "Leymah has a way of
confusing us.

00:33:27.180 --> 00:33:31.179
[audience laughs] She'll pick the phone and
say come, come oh, come, you have to come

00:33:31.179 --> 00:33:34.780
so Grandma I need you, I need you, I need
you.

00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:37.140
Without thinking we are on the next flight
to her."

00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:46.620
What's so, and so I mean you can't but forgive
anyone who has been very negative to you but

00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:48.800
continue to be supportive.

00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:54.820
You get to the place where you understand,
so my mother has been that way, I will tie,

00:33:54.820 --> 00:34:01.810
so if I have a challenging task ahead of me,
as a matter of fact I call her every day,

00:34:01.810 --> 00:34:07.240
regardless of which part of the world I find
myself, I'll call her.

00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:08.429
And then I say, "Pea", I call her Pea.

00:34:08.429 --> 00:34:13.229
"I am, I need you to pray for me."

00:34:13.229 --> 00:34:17.539
And she said, "That has been taken care of
this morning.

00:34:17.539 --> 00:34:19.039
[audience laughs] Anything else?"

00:34:19.039 --> 00:34:22.389
But we just chat and we just talk.

00:34:22.389 --> 00:34:29.869
Because I see that woman as a pillar of strength
and I keep saying to myself and to my kids

00:34:29.869 --> 00:34:36.899
that I am that pillar of strength so tell
me anything even if it is the most painful

00:34:36.899 --> 00:34:41.200
thing in this world, I want to be that supportive
mother.

00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:42.889
I want to be your friend.

00:34:42.889 --> 00:34:45.710
I want to be your partner in any venture.

00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:49.419
I want to be there, I want to be, I want to
be, I want to be.

00:34:49.419 --> 00:34:55.139
And I think we are on that road to the point
that my 13-year old came to tell me a few

00:34:55.139 --> 00:34:58.569
months ago she fall in love.

00:34:58.569 --> 00:34:59.809
[laughter]

00:34:59.809 --> 00:35:05.970
&gt;&gt;Leymah Gbowee: And then I went, "Jesus,
Jesus, Jesus, give me the strength not to

00:35:05.970 --> 00:35:07.809
box this child."

00:35:07.809 --> 00:35:08.809
[laughter]

00:35:08.809 --> 00:35:13.749
&gt;&gt;Leymah Gbowee: So I said, "Well, let me
think about it", and then I came back to her

00:35:13.749 --> 00:35:20.269
and said, "The love you found has earned you
an all-girls boarding school.

00:35:20.269 --> 00:35:23.829
[audience laughs] And they're going to cut
your hair."

00:35:23.829 --> 00:35:29.710
A few weeks later she said, "Momma, you know
I don't think that love is worth it.

00:35:29.710 --> 00:35:32.450
I've let him go.

00:35:32.450 --> 00:35:35.200
I will do it some other time."

00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:36.200
[laughter]

00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:39.200
&gt;&gt;Megan Smith: Excellent.

00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:40.210
Fabulous.

00:35:40.210 --> 00:35:45.359
So we had Gloria Steinem on stage yesterday
we had our Fortune conference and she's an

00:35:45.359 --> 00:35:49.539
amazing leader for women around the world
and in our country and she was quoting Alice

00:35:49.539 --> 00:35:55.460
Walker the author saying the main way we lose
power is to think we don't have any.

00:35:55.460 --> 00:36:01.890
And what you leading and the women did was
came together first as we saw in some of the

00:36:01.890 --> 00:36:06.930
depictions in the film with the white dress
and standing bearing witness and then later

00:36:06.930 --> 00:36:11.279
as you with the sex strike and getting Charles
Taylor to come to the peace talks.

00:36:11.279 --> 00:36:15.559
Can you tell the story about when you went
to the peace talks and they were not getting

00:36:15.559 --> 00:36:17.269
it done, what you guys did?

00:36:17.269 --> 00:36:22.099
&gt;&gt;Leymah Gbowee: We went to the peace talks
first real All of the work we did we were

00:36:22.099 --> 00:36:23.099
naīve.

00:36:23.099 --> 00:36:27.029
We didn't think that, we didn't think through
nonviolent struggle, we didn't think through

00:36:27.029 --> 00:36:30.220
the movement, we didn't think about the costly
nature.

00:36:30.220 --> 00:36:35.579
We went to Accra with $1,000 thinking it would
last us two weeks and we would be back home

00:36:35.579 --> 00:36:36.650
with a peace agreement.

00:36:36.650 --> 00:36:37.759
It lasted three months.

00:36:37.759 --> 00:36:42.380
And in three months a ceasefire had failed.

00:36:42.380 --> 00:36:48.089
In three months, we observed our warlords
end the peace talks and sit by the pool of

00:36:48.089 --> 00:36:56.450
their hotel and get massaged by girls in bikinis,
meanwhile you listen to the radio, 200 people

00:36:56.450 --> 00:36:57.450
had died.

00:36:57.450 --> 00:36:58.450
A missile landed here.

00:36:58.450 --> 00:37:02.670
And then they were just disrespectful to us
sitting there protesting.

00:37:02.670 --> 00:37:06.289
Every morning they passed they would insult
us.

00:37:06.289 --> 00:37:11.099
Some of them called us Taylor's girlfriends,
depending on how they felt that morning.

00:37:11.099 --> 00:37:15.430
Some of them called us, so we, we had gotten
to that place, I had gotten to the place where

00:37:15.430 --> 00:37:20.710
I had lost every confidence I had ever had
in nonviolence, because I got to the place

00:37:20.710 --> 00:37:22.240
where I started questioning myself.

00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:24.960
What good is sitting here?

00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:31.930
The ones who are committing the evil, they're
being protected, they're being paid.

00:37:31.930 --> 00:37:34.160
We can't even find food.

00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:37.940
We were 10 to a hotel room.

00:37:37.940 --> 00:37:45.739
We didn't have anything and these people were
coming with siren cars, bodyguards.

00:37:45.739 --> 00:37:49.940
So I started until it reached to a point where
I stopped going to protest.

00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:54.089
The women would go to protest and I would
just call and I would not be home, I would

00:37:54.089 --> 00:38:00.630
just wander, I would just walk and walk and
I was crying so badly there that I developed

00:38:00.630 --> 00:38:02.250
an eye infection.

00:38:02.250 --> 00:38:05.749
I just cried and I was very angry.

00:38:05.749 --> 00:38:14.619
This day I was watching the Associated Press
video from Liberia on Yahoo.

00:38:14.619 --> 00:38:22.039
And they showed two little boys who had woken
up that morning to brush their teeth.

00:38:22.039 --> 00:38:23.720
A missile landed.

00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:28.150
All that left of those two boys were their
slippers.

00:38:28.150 --> 00:38:30.710
They were crushed.

00:38:30.710 --> 00:38:36.430
A girl had given birth the night before, she
came to hang her baby's diapers.

00:38:36.430 --> 00:38:38.690
She was also crushed.

00:38:38.690 --> 00:38:44.950
On that video her mother had the young baby
showing to the press people, say she give

00:38:44.950 --> 00:38:49.960
birth less than four hours ago, what do I
do with this child?

00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:57.289
I got up, put on my white t-shirt, went to
the peace hall and said to Shugas, "Do you

00:38:57.289 --> 00:38:58.289
have money?"

00:38:58.289 --> 00:38:59.890
Shugas is my mentor.

00:38:59.890 --> 00:39:01.710
She said, "Leymah, I have a little bit."

00:39:01.710 --> 00:39:04.660
I say, "Let's send for more women from the
refugee camp."

00:39:04.660 --> 00:39:05.849
She say, "Why?"

00:39:05.849 --> 00:39:10.369
I say, "I'll let you know, just send for the
women."

00:39:10.369 --> 00:39:13.690
She called and told the women, the women were
always ready.

00:39:13.690 --> 00:39:16.630
They just got into a bus and they made the
journey.

00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:23.230
The journalists were about to leave and I
went to them and said, "Don't go.

00:39:23.230 --> 00:39:25.010
You have a story to write today."

00:39:25.010 --> 00:39:28.650
And they said, "Miss Gbowee, what?"

00:39:28.650 --> 00:39:31.819
"Just stay for a few hours."

00:39:31.819 --> 00:39:36.950
Ten o'clock, the warlords went into the peace
hall.

00:39:36.950 --> 00:39:44.239
As soon as they went in, I went to the women,
there were about maybe 100 close to 200, sit

00:39:44.239 --> 00:39:46.950
at the door and loop arms.

00:39:46.950 --> 00:39:49.339
And they just followed.

00:39:49.339 --> 00:39:57.430
They went and sat and looped arms so we barricaded
the entrance of the hall and then I went in

00:39:57.430 --> 00:40:03.130
and sat down and wrote my hostage note just
like in the movies,

00:40:03.130 --> 00:40:04.130
[laughter]

00:40:04.130 --> 00:40:07.279
&gt;&gt;Leymah Gbowee: except I didn't have the
sound thing.

00:40:07.279 --> 00:40:16.440
Then I tapped on the glass door of the peace
hall and a Nigerian general, who is late now,

00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:22.150
turned and look at me and I said to you, he
said me, he said, I said please come.

00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:25.700
He came, I handed him the note, I said for
the chief negotiator.

00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:28.190
He took it to him.

00:40:28.190 --> 00:40:38.059
He read it and on the overhead speaker he
said, "Oh my God.

00:40:38.059 --> 00:40:43.730
Distinguished ladies and gentlemen, General
Leymah and her troops have seized the peace

00:40:43.730 --> 00:40:45.450
hall."

00:40:45.450 --> 00:40:48.130
Commotion in the room.

00:40:48.130 --> 00:40:49.190
So he came outside.

00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:54.930
But when they sound, when he made that announcement
the police came running.

00:40:54.930 --> 00:40:58.339
And then they said they would arrest me.

00:40:58.339 --> 00:40:59.339
Why?

00:40:59.339 --> 00:41:01.890
For obstructing justice.

00:41:01.890 --> 00:41:04.549
I spoke about my childhood.

00:41:04.549 --> 00:41:11.530
I spoke earlier about that place I grew up
in the belief in the protection of women and

00:41:11.530 --> 00:41:12.530
children.

00:41:12.530 --> 00:41:14.779
That moment flashed past me.

00:41:14.779 --> 00:41:18.549
And I realized that this is a dog eat dog's
world.

00:41:18.549 --> 00:41:20.479
No one will fight for you.

00:41:20.479 --> 00:41:23.119
No one will protect you.

00:41:23.119 --> 00:41:29.460
Everything that had been socialized to believe,
all of my value system collapsed at that moment.

00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:37.239
Me, obstructing justice, when all I'm trying
to do for months all I've been trying to do

00:41:37.239 --> 00:41:42.800
with these women is to bring a semblance of
justice into their lives.

00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:43.859
I said, "Sir."

00:41:43.859 --> 00:41:44.930
He said, "Yes?"

00:41:44.930 --> 00:41:49.079
"I'll make it very easy for you to, to arrest
me."

00:41:49.079 --> 00:41:54.519
I took off my head tie and he said, "What
are you doing?"

00:41:54.519 --> 00:41:56.650
I say, "I'm stripping naked for you."

00:41:56.650 --> 00:42:03.799
When I was taking off my wrap, this Liberian
man came and grabbed me and said, "Don't do

00:42:03.799 --> 00:42:04.799
that."

00:42:04.799 --> 00:42:12.200
But as he grabbed me, all of the security
men have fled, those who were arresting me,

00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:17.180
because they didn't want to be in the face
of bad luck.

00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:23.200
The men who were arresting me came back to
say, "Send your women to the windows because

00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:25.849
the delegates are jumping out of the windows."

00:42:25.849 --> 00:42:26.849
[laughter]

00:42:26.849 --> 00:42:34.109
&gt;&gt;Leymah Gbowee: So we had to send women to
the window to seize that side of the window.

00:42:34.109 --> 00:42:44.789
But after that act, we went in the room, they
negotiated with us and there was the feeling

00:42:44.789 --> 00:42:46.569
of emancipation.

00:42:46.569 --> 00:42:52.489
We had been begging for peace and now they
were negotiating with us.

00:42:52.489 --> 00:42:54.309
Oh man.

00:42:54.309 --> 00:42:57.210
That was a good feeling.

00:42:57.210 --> 00:43:05.089
So we came back and said yes, we would let
them out of there, but these are our conditions.

00:43:05.089 --> 00:43:13.150
That peace hall that had been a place that
was like a circus turned sober and in three

00:43:13.150 --> 00:43:16.390
weeks we had a peace agreement signed.

00:43:16.390 --> 00:43:18.690
&gt;&gt;Megan Smith: Amazing.

00:43:18.690 --> 00:43:20.989
&gt;&gt;Leymah Gbowee: Yeah.

00:43:20.989 --> 00:43:24.049
&gt;&gt;Megan Smith: Just incredible.

00:43:24.049 --> 00:43:25.589
That's leadership.

00:43:25.589 --> 00:43:34.040
So the war ended and things transitioned and
so I'd love to cut to-- before we open up

00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:37.940
to questions, to what you are doing now.

00:43:37.940 --> 00:43:42.539
I mean 75 percent of the Liberian infrastructure
was destroyed.

00:43:42.539 --> 00:43:43.710
And so the election.

00:43:43.710 --> 00:43:46.829
&gt;&gt;Leymah Gbowee: We got African first female
president.

00:43:46.829 --> 00:43:48.009
&gt;&gt;Megan Smith: Yes.

00:43:48.009 --> 00:43:51.529
&gt;&gt;Leymah Gbowee: And we're fighting to reelect
her again.

00:43:51.529 --> 00:43:57.229
Now my work, I've taken it out of Liberia
and into the region.

00:43:57.229 --> 00:44:02.729
I run an organization called Women Peace and
Security Network Africa.

00:44:02.729 --> 00:44:06.489
One of the things we came to understand after
we did all we did in Liberia was that there's

00:44:06.489 --> 00:44:11.150
no way you can talk about peace without the
whole issue of security.

00:44:11.150 --> 00:44:15.789
And there's no way you can talk about a conventional
form of security without looking at the human

00:44:15.789 --> 00:44:18.069
security aspect.

00:44:18.069 --> 00:44:23.619
So after wars, one of the most exotic things
you see in the world now is that countries

00:44:23.619 --> 00:44:29.540
go into this post-conflict countries and say,
"We want to reconstruct or reform your army."

00:44:29.540 --> 00:44:35.779
And they put billions of dollars into those
processes and then where you have the army

00:44:35.779 --> 00:44:40.829
barracks being built, the communities are
living in shanty towns.

00:44:40.829 --> 00:44:47.130
So the conversation then that we've started
is beyond the military infrastructure, can

00:44:47.130 --> 00:44:53.930
there be a balance between basic social services
and military infrastructure?

00:44:53.930 --> 00:44:58.849
Because if you buy all of the jet bombers
of the world and people needs are not met,

00:44:58.849 --> 00:45:02.530
these are the same people who will come and
attack your jet bombers and conflict will

00:45:02.530 --> 00:45:03.789
erupt.

00:45:03.789 --> 00:45:05.529
So we've started that conversation.

00:45:05.529 --> 00:45:14.140
Beyond that we recognize that our work, my
12, my 13-year old at 12 told me once, "Momma,

00:45:14.140 --> 00:45:18.049
your work is all about you and your friends
talking to each other."

00:45:18.049 --> 00:45:25.450
We've never really included women in the private
sector, women in the military.

00:45:25.450 --> 00:45:31.140
So now we're going back to military institutions,
security institutions to ask them, how are

00:45:31.140 --> 00:45:33.390
you doing your work?

00:45:33.390 --> 00:45:35.359
[coughing] Excuse me.

00:45:35.359 --> 00:45:42.729
How are you doing your work that women are
not saying in the leadership, so for example,

00:45:42.729 --> 00:45:47.499
in West Africa, Sierra Leone has the only
woman brigadier general in all of the armies

00:45:47.499 --> 00:45:50.799
in West Africa.

00:45:50.799 --> 00:45:53.229
So we are asking these people, how are you
doing your work?

00:45:53.229 --> 00:45:57.839
And then we're asking the women, how are you
surviving?

00:45:57.839 --> 00:46:03.069
And how are we outside, how can we help you
do your work easier?

00:46:03.069 --> 00:46:08.010
So how can we connect rural women with military
women, young girls with military women?

00:46:08.010 --> 00:46:14.650
So that there is not this misconception about
security, that security is out there and community

00:46:14.650 --> 00:46:18.029
is down here and security is there to trample
on community.

00:46:18.029 --> 00:46:22.690
We want to start a whole new conversation
about how security is negotiated.

00:46:22.690 --> 00:46:25.160
The second part of our work is leaders.

00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:27.630
We do leadership for girls.

00:46:27.630 --> 00:46:35.479
But I was telling you earlier on that we got
a whole $100,000 worth, I spoke at Tina Brown's

00:46:35.479 --> 00:46:42.229
event in New York about a year ago and the,
one of the heads of HP was there and he decided

00:46:42.229 --> 00:46:47.800
we will give you whatever you want, so they
give us $100,000 worth of equipment shipped

00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:50.470
from here to Liberia.

00:46:50.470 --> 00:46:55.089
I was excited when we got it because one of
the trainings we held for the women in the

00:46:55.089 --> 00:47:02.060
security sector, there were 50 of the most
senior, none of them knew how to send bulk

00:47:02.060 --> 00:47:03.300
text messages.

00:47:03.300 --> 00:47:10.779
Of all of the women in that room, only two
had e-mail addresses.

00:47:10.779 --> 00:47:18.450
And the two that had addresses, children were
the ones who did their e-mails for them.

00:47:18.450 --> 00:47:26.489
So we felt like this thing from HP would be
a good thing to set up an IT center that will

00:47:26.489 --> 00:47:31.559
call for leadership in excellence where women,
girls can come to learn.

00:47:31.559 --> 00:47:33.829
So that's our newest project.

00:47:33.829 --> 00:47:38.599
We launched the center.

00:47:38.599 --> 00:47:40.630
Sorry.

00:47:40.630 --> 00:47:45.369
I've seen this happen to white people, not
me.

00:47:45.369 --> 00:47:46.369
[laughter]

00:47:46.369 --> 00:47:53.499
&gt;&gt;Megan Smith: One thing I'll tell you while
you, you collect your voice.

00:47:53.499 --> 00:47:55.999
We were able to do internet camp in Monrovia

00:47:55.999 --> 00:47:56.999
&gt;&gt;Leymah Gbowee: Ok.

00:47:56.999 --> 00:48:00.339
&gt;&gt;Megan Smith: about two years ago and so
I'm excited to hear that the center is there

00:48:00.339 --> 00:48:05.339
because we met extraordinarily talented techies,
our colleagues, our Google kindred spirits

00:48:05.339 --> 00:48:09.450
there and so we will make sure that we interconnect
them and bring them.

00:48:09.450 --> 00:48:13.319
&gt;&gt;Leymah Gbowee: Definitely because I have
no idea, my work is protest, my work is women's

00:48:13.319 --> 00:48:18.930
issue, I took out my iPad because I was at
Google and I wanted to feel like I'm part

00:48:18.930 --> 00:48:19.930
of you folks.

00:48:19.930 --> 00:48:20.930
[laughter]

00:48:20.930 --> 00:48:25.700
&gt;&gt;Leymah Gbowee: But since I bought it, I
don't know the futures.

00:48:25.700 --> 00:48:28.000
I play Scrabble and check my mails.

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:29.240
That's it.

00:48:29.240 --> 00:48:32.959
I didn't buy it, I got it as a Christmas present.

00:48:32.959 --> 00:48:37.559
So we do, the IT center is set up and right
now we're at a place where we want, we're

00:48:37.559 --> 00:48:46.529
my partner is an IT person and he is our consultant
because I have no idea so he helped me through

00:48:46.529 --> 00:48:49.489
the whole negotiation with HP.

00:48:49.489 --> 00:48:55.039
So we're now having a conversation on how
we want to run that place beyond setting up

00:48:55.039 --> 00:49:02.789
e-mails and all of the different things, my
take is that we will go into the public schools

00:49:02.789 --> 00:49:09.190
and get girls, train them on the weekends
so that when they're leaving high school in

00:49:09.190 --> 00:49:16.880
September of next year, each of them have
a basic knowledge of using the computer.

00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:18.619
That's how I see it.

00:49:18.619 --> 00:49:23.369
We're also bringing women from the Sierra
Leone army to pair them with the Liberian

00:49:23.369 --> 00:49:26.410
army to train them at that center.

00:49:26.410 --> 00:49:28.839
How is going to be done, I don't know.

00:49:28.839 --> 00:49:33.920
All I know is that the Norwegian government
has given us $8,000 to bring these women from

00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:35.769
Sierra Leone to Liberia.

00:49:35.769 --> 00:49:41.279
What will be the content of the training,
please don't ask me.

00:49:41.279 --> 00:49:44.670
So we do that whenever we have something called
Girls in Leadership Project.

00:49:44.670 --> 00:49:47.049
We work with girls in the community.

00:49:47.049 --> 00:49:50.630
We have something called the West African
Women Policy Forum that we partner with another

00:49:50.630 --> 00:49:51.630
group.

00:49:51.630 --> 00:49:56.299
Every year we bring a think tank of women
from civil society government and the regional

00:49:56.299 --> 00:50:01.420
economic community so that we share our experiences
around women's political participation.

00:50:01.420 --> 00:50:09.990
As I speak, this year, as part of our convening
for five, for the last five years we've organized

00:50:09.990 --> 00:50:13.160
the first ever West African women elections
observance mission.

00:50:13.160 --> 00:50:14.160
&gt;&gt;Megan Smith: Fabulous.

00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:17.970
&gt;&gt;Leymah Gbowee: So those women we are now
in Liberia to observe the elections, but what

00:50:17.970 --> 00:50:21.489
they're observing is not the conventional
thing.

00:50:21.489 --> 00:50:26.459
So they're observing how women are treated
during the polls, you know, pregnant women,

00:50:26.459 --> 00:50:31.309
if they were given preference and all of those
different things that just to see how our

00:50:31.309 --> 00:50:36.940
election is conducted in Africa that either
turn women off from going to the polls or

00:50:36.940 --> 00:50:39.410
encourage women to go to the polls.

00:50:39.410 --> 00:50:44.119
The final thing we do now, we have something
called Youth Security and Development with

00:50:44.119 --> 00:50:49.339
the minister of youth and sports . And they
allow the Youth Security and Development Project

00:50:49.339 --> 00:50:52.589
we are looking at youth justice and accountability.

00:50:52.589 --> 00:50:59.170
The problem with West Africa now is the youth
bulge, no jobs.

00:50:59.170 --> 00:51:01.859
Violence is their first take.

00:51:01.859 --> 00:51:05.920
So we want to really start talking, working
with these young people, start having conversations

00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:10.219
with them to really see where can we take
it from here to there.

00:51:10.219 --> 00:51:16.359
And I would really, really love to see you
know I know that Google has been back and

00:51:16.359 --> 00:51:21.249
forth to Liberia, what has come out of it
I don't know because I don't even have a Twitter

00:51:21.249 --> 00:51:24.140
or Facebook account, so this is just to see.

00:51:24.140 --> 00:51:26.019
I don't have a Gmail, I'm so embarrassed.

00:51:26.019 --> 00:51:27.019
[laughter]

00:51:27.019 --> 00:51:29.239
&gt;&gt;Megan Smith: We'll get you one.

00:51:29.239 --> 00:51:33.430
&gt;&gt;Leymah Gbowee: And so, but just to think
about the youth, think about technology, think

00:51:33.430 --> 00:51:39.789
about where the world is and what kind of
assistance not just for Liberia but for other

00:51:39.789 --> 00:51:42.890
countries that are emerging out of conflict.

00:51:42.890 --> 00:51:47.479
Because where the world is now if this young
people might get, must get jobs.

00:51:47.479 --> 00:51:53.529
They have to be able to do some of the things
that the little children in this country can

00:51:53.529 --> 00:51:54.529
do.

00:51:54.529 --> 00:51:55.700
So basically that's the work that I do.

00:51:55.700 --> 00:52:01.229
Beyond that, I get invited to places like
here to shoot my mouth off, [audience chuckles]

00:52:01.229 --> 00:52:07.809
to talk about how the international community
is failing miserably in building peace and

00:52:07.809 --> 00:52:12.500
yet last night someone asked me a question
at a panel I was in Seattle.

00:52:12.500 --> 00:52:18.309
And I said to the lady, please in two weeks
I have to apply for my visa, don't let them

00:52:18.309 --> 00:52:23.380
blacklist me for a new visa because I have
my own opinion about the politics of this

00:52:23.380 --> 00:52:29.180
nation, but I do a lot and I feel like I'm
grounded because I go into the communities

00:52:29.180 --> 00:52:30.239
and work.

00:52:30.239 --> 00:52:35.109
At the national level I'm able to sit with
policy makers and say this other policy is

00:52:35.109 --> 00:52:36.220
not working.

00:52:36.220 --> 00:52:37.900
This is working.

00:52:37.900 --> 00:52:42.130
And I'm able to go at the international level
and talk to people about some of the needs

00:52:42.130 --> 00:52:44.180
in these communities.

00:52:44.180 --> 00:52:49.390
One of the examples of our work with the girls,
in one community, in three years not a single

00:52:49.390 --> 00:52:51.789
girl has graduated from high school.

00:52:51.789 --> 00:52:55.630
This year is the first time they have five
girls that are about to graduate from high

00:52:55.630 --> 00:52:57.459
school in that community.

00:52:57.459 --> 00:53:03.140
So the President of Liberia had no idea, so
working at community we're able to come back

00:53:03.140 --> 00:53:06.519
to them to say these are some of the problems
we've seen.

00:53:06.519 --> 00:53:12.519
But also the people you have in control of
that particular community you need to fire

00:53:12.519 --> 00:53:14.979
them because they are not doing the right
thing.

00:53:14.979 --> 00:53:19.740
So we're able to do that kind of so I feel
like I'm at a privileged place, a blessed

00:53:19.740 --> 00:53:24.109
place, you know, where I'm able to go back
and forth at different levels and do what

00:53:24.109 --> 00:53:25.680
I love doing.

00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:32.849
Beyond that as much as I like to come outside
I, I feel the best part of my work is in a

00:53:32.849 --> 00:53:38.119
community because that what keeps me grounded,
reminds me every day of the reason for the

00:53:38.119 --> 00:53:39.559
struggle in the first place.

00:53:39.559 --> 00:53:40.559
Yeah.

00:53:40.559 --> 00:53:41.700
&gt;&gt;Megan Smith: Fabulous.

00:53:41.700 --> 00:53:44.839
We love to help you with the tech center.

00:53:44.839 --> 00:53:47.869
We have seen amazing groups all around the
world who created curriculum.

00:53:47.869 --> 00:53:51.719
One of my favorite ones, there's some here,
in Silicon Valley and other places, but one

00:53:51.719 --> 00:53:57.180
of them is a group called Mirabits, that's
been going for a dozen years now, taking very

00:53:57.180 --> 00:54:01.920
talented youth leaders out of the slums in
Kibera in Nairobi, training them on internet

00:54:01.920 --> 00:54:08.039
how to you know HTML and, and really making
web pages, blogging, etc. and then come right

00:54:08.039 --> 00:54:13.200
into the tech center in Nairobi, so going
from no job possibility to right in, so there's

00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:17.680
programs like that that we can connect the
talent in Liberia to.

00:54:17.680 --> 00:54:21.140
I want to open up quick to questions and so
you have a little bit more time

00:54:21.140 --> 00:54:24.779
or if you just have a comment.

00:54:24.779 --> 00:54:25.779
Yeah.

00:54:25.779 --> 00:54:26.859
&gt;&gt;female #3: Hi.

00:54:26.859 --> 00:54:34.240
As I watched Pray the Devil Back to Hell several
months ago and I found it very stunning visually,

00:54:34.240 --> 00:54:39.699
just to see the all white that you were sitting
in and the linking of the arms and blocking

00:54:39.699 --> 00:54:45.589
the men from coming into the buildings and
you know them having to walk around you and

00:54:45.589 --> 00:54:49.839
what I felt was when you'd, you'd mentioned
the quote by Alice Walker about power and

00:54:49.839 --> 00:54:53.920
you know the only time you don't have power
is when you don't think you have it or whatever

00:54:53.920 --> 00:54:58.039
and what I really felt when I was watching
it is like if you looked at a superficial

00:54:58.039 --> 00:55:03.880
level it just looked like there's no way they're
gonna be safe even let alone be you know have

00:55:03.880 --> 00:55:06.970
these men trying to negotiate with you.

00:55:06.970 --> 00:55:11.900
And I just wondered, I know you've said you
did this for pure survival, and I just wondered

00:55:11.900 --> 00:55:17.279
if you had any sense while you were in it
of how powerful you were before the tides

00:55:17.279 --> 00:55:24.199
turned and they asked you to negotiate and
also if you just had moments of sheer terror

00:55:24.199 --> 00:55:27.299
or kind of what you were running on and were
there moments of joy and?

00:55:27.299 --> 00:55:32.199
&gt;&gt;Leymah Gbowee: You know I always get this
question, were you afraid?

00:55:32.199 --> 00:55:33.910
The war started when I was 17.

00:55:33.910 --> 00:55:39.999
I had my moments with terror in those early
stages.

00:55:39.999 --> 00:55:43.400
The first time I saw a dead body I froze.

00:55:43.400 --> 00:55:50.410
By the time I was 31, I could walk over a
dead body without a second thought.

00:55:50.410 --> 00:55:56.619
So fear had become, I had become immune to
anything called fear.

00:55:56.619 --> 00:55:57.749
That was the first thing.

00:55:57.749 --> 00:56:01.569
The second thing what I felt powerful.

00:56:01.569 --> 00:56:11.949
When we started the protests there were little
things that made me gradually over time recognize

00:56:11.949 --> 00:56:14.359
that people feared us.

00:56:14.359 --> 00:56:17.539
Small things that would happen.

00:56:17.539 --> 00:56:23.039
We went to Parliament and the speaker of Parliament
and I got into a confrontation and we came

00:56:23.039 --> 00:56:24.039
this close to having a fistfight.

00:56:24.039 --> 00:56:28.099
The women came between us.

00:56:28.099 --> 00:56:29.949
No one arrested me.

00:56:29.949 --> 00:56:33.430
I checked that.

00:56:33.430 --> 00:56:40.969
The following time we were seated on the airfield
he came and said president, he sent his bodyguard

00:56:40.969 --> 00:56:44.980
to call me that he had a message from the
President.

00:56:44.980 --> 00:56:49.220
And I told the bodyguard, "Go and tell your
boss I'm in my office, he should come and

00:56:49.220 --> 00:56:50.220
see me."

00:56:50.220 --> 00:56:57.170
He got out of his car, walked to me, check
that.

00:56:57.170 --> 00:57:07.209
We went to Accra and the warlords from the
other warring faction had come and the women

00:57:07.209 --> 00:57:17.730
went to meet him and they knelt down and I
saw a total change in his expression and then

00:57:17.730 --> 00:57:19.150
he became insulting.

00:57:19.150 --> 00:57:22.229
I told them, "Get up, get up, get up."

00:57:22.229 --> 00:57:28.309
And then I looked him straight in the eye
and told him, "You fool, you will never get

00:57:28.309 --> 00:57:33.900
us to kneel down before you again."

00:57:33.900 --> 00:57:38.410
Whenever we have to talk to you we'll talk
to you at this level.

00:57:38.410 --> 00:57:42.859
And then he say, "You will get nothing from
me."

00:57:42.859 --> 00:57:43.859
I said, "Let's see."

00:57:43.859 --> 00:57:51.970
We went back to a meeting and we decided as
women, no more we kneel before any man to

00:57:51.970 --> 00:57:54.480
appeal for peace.

00:57:54.480 --> 00:58:03.420
So gradually we learned those lessons and
gradually we knew that people feared us.

00:58:03.420 --> 00:58:11.199
And gradually our confidence in what we did
grew and our confidence in ourselves grew.

00:58:11.199 --> 00:58:20.299
My dear, someone says that injection that
the women took, we wish we had a way to undo

00:58:20.299 --> 00:58:24.450
it because it's too much for the Liberian
people now.

00:58:24.450 --> 00:58:27.109
[audience chuckles]

00:58:27.109 --> 00:58:32.420
&gt;&gt;Megan Smith: Other questions?

00:58:32.420 --> 00:58:33.740
[pause]

00:58:33.740 --> 00:58:37.730
&gt;&gt;female #4: Hi.

00:58:37.730 --> 00:58:43.670
So my question is that I noticed that in the
press especially here in America what really

00:58:43.670 --> 00:58:48.260
got covered was the fact that the women were
withholding sex from the men and if you watch

00:58:48.260 --> 00:58:53.140
the documentary and the book it doesn't really
play that big of a role and so I'm wondering

00:58:53.140 --> 00:58:54.160
how you, how you felt about that.

00:58:54.160 --> 00:59:02.190
&gt;&gt;Leymah Gbowee: Well, you know this country,
the sex industry keeps the financial wheel

00:59:02.190 --> 00:59:03.190
turning.

00:59:03.190 --> 00:59:04.190
[laughter]

00:59:04.190 --> 00:59:05.190
&gt;&gt;Leymah Gbowee: If I could put it that way.

00:59:05.190 --> 00:59:09.349
And I'm on YouTube, oh my God.

00:59:09.349 --> 00:59:10.349
[laughter]

00:59:10.349 --> 00:59:14.440
&gt;&gt;Leymah Gbowee: I'll tell you a story.

00:59:14.440 --> 00:59:20.329
My sister lives in New York and we have our
girl time when I'm there.

00:59:20.329 --> 00:59:28.410
So we're flipping through the pages of a magazine
and imagining that we are big shots now and

00:59:28.410 --> 00:59:35.049
the advert, there's an advert in this magazine
of a watch, a wristwatch and there is this

00:59:35.049 --> 00:59:40.930
young man in his underwear with the wristwatch
on his thigh.

00:59:40.930 --> 00:59:46.269
And then I said, "Fata, which part of his
body is going to wear this watch?"

00:59:46.269 --> 00:59:47.269
[laughter]

00:59:47.269 --> 00:59:50.150
&gt;&gt;Leymah Gbowee: She said, "I don't know."

00:59:50.150 --> 00:59:55.890
I say, "Is there a new way of wearing watch
in America?"

00:59:55.890 --> 00:59:56.890
[laughter]

00:59:56.890 --> 01:00:02.539
&gt;&gt;Leymah Gbowee: "Because I don't see the
correlation of a young man with everything

01:00:02.539 --> 01:00:04.859
showing and a watch on his thigh.

01:00:04.859 --> 01:00:09.039
Please tell me that there is not a new way
of wearing watch in this country."

01:00:09.039 --> 01:00:13.699
[audience chuckles] And that image is what
people will go with, some will wear a silver

01:00:13.699 --> 01:00:16.209
watch to that other side.

01:00:16.209 --> 01:00:19.630
But that was what it implied.

01:00:19.630 --> 01:00:26.440
So anything about sex will sell.

01:00:26.440 --> 01:00:33.670
So people will ask questions and sometimes
I think one of the reasons why they were they

01:00:33.670 --> 01:00:39.769
asked a lot of questions about the sex strike
is not because sex also sell or because the

01:00:39.769 --> 01:00:45.699
thing is you are the, the image of African
women is that we're weak and we're battered

01:00:45.699 --> 01:00:49.910
most of the time and we have no control over
our bodies.

01:00:49.910 --> 01:00:55.400
So how can you be withholding sex when you
are the slaves of your men?

01:00:55.400 --> 01:01:00.819
So it's like, hmm, let's assume really, you
know?

01:01:00.819 --> 01:01:04.079
But the image is not always what it seem.

01:01:04.079 --> 01:01:10.079
And yes we did start that strategy, it didn't
last in the urban areas very long for many

01:01:10.079 --> 01:01:11.079
reasons.

01:01:11.079 --> 01:01:14.069
But in the rural areas the women were more
strategic.

01:01:14.069 --> 01:01:22.219
They invited their husbands to the church
and said we're on a journey to peace building

01:01:22.219 --> 01:01:27.039
and this journey is going to entail fasting,
praying and different actions.

01:01:27.039 --> 01:01:34.140
And you know the act of fasting is the act
of denial of the, the, the pleasures of food,

01:01:34.140 --> 01:01:36.839
sex and all of these things.

01:01:36.839 --> 01:01:43.259
So we are appealing to you that as we fast,
we cannot engage and those men were the ones

01:01:43.259 --> 01:01:46.099
who were being killed on a daily basis.

01:01:46.099 --> 01:01:47.819
They wanted peace also.

01:01:47.819 --> 01:01:49.390
So they agreed.

01:01:49.390 --> 01:01:54.269
And for months they did not have sex, these
women were not having sex.

01:01:54.269 --> 01:01:58.440
They didn't go with "we are on a strike",
but they were on a strike.

01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:03.619
The day we ended the protest two years later
in one of the communities because we went

01:02:03.619 --> 01:02:08.249
all around the country to launch the protest
and we went all around the country to end

01:02:08.249 --> 01:02:09.760
the protest.

01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:14.199
So when we ended in one of the communities
we were about to end the program and a woman

01:02:14.199 --> 01:02:20.769
came to me and said, no and there is a final
presentation we'll see these old men, chiefs,

01:02:20.769 --> 01:02:27.130
rural men coming with flowers, some of them
had gifts wrapped and they were calling their

01:02:27.130 --> 01:02:31.559
wives one at a time and telling them thank
you for bringing peace and one of them leaned

01:02:31.559 --> 01:02:34.130
over to me and says, "It's all about the sex
tonight."

01:02:34.130 --> 01:02:35.130
[laughter]

01:02:35.130 --> 01:02:39.769
&gt;&gt;Leymah Gbowee: Because the gift was like
you know the fast is finished, the war is

01:02:39.769 --> 01:02:41.960
over, now we can do something today.

01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:43.819
[laughter] But yes.

01:02:43.819 --> 01:02:49.420
But also I mean just to come back as someone
working with young people, the, the use of

01:02:49.420 --> 01:02:59.290
the media and that overt objectification is
destroying not just this country, but our

01:02:59.290 --> 01:03:01.479
country as well.

01:03:01.479 --> 01:03:08.529
Young girls now think their bodies starts
from here, starts from here, end here.

01:03:08.529 --> 01:03:11.470
It's not there, it's not there.

01:03:11.470 --> 01:03:15.690
When I was growing up we made candies to sell.

01:03:15.690 --> 01:03:21.450
If you look at the pictures in this book you
will see me selling donut as a refugee in

01:03:21.450 --> 01:03:22.509
Ghana.

01:03:22.509 --> 01:03:26.849
Today not many refugee girls are interested
in selling donuts.

01:03:26.849 --> 01:03:34.650
Why do I want to sell donut when I will make
$2 and if I sell myself I can make $20.

01:03:34.650 --> 01:03:41.680
So that, the whole, the, the, I think you
people need to start a campaign here, showcasing

01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:48.959
the very smart women that the world of Google
is not turning on here and here, it's turning

01:03:48.959 --> 01:03:50.410
on their brains.

01:03:50.410 --> 01:03:56.170
All of those girls who are going on Facebook
and Twitter and YouTube to expose themselves,

01:03:56.170 --> 01:04:03.299
I think you need to put out on YouTube the
young women who keep this place turning so

01:04:03.299 --> 01:04:09.220
that people understand that our world has
not degenerated to our sexual organs.

01:04:09.220 --> 01:04:14.650
My, I have my white nieces they go to universities
because since I've been coming to America,

01:04:14.650 --> 01:04:19.150
I have many white relatives, so if you bring
your children who will start calling me aunties

01:04:19.150 --> 01:04:23.859
and they will become my left auntie and then
they are my nephews if you bring yours.

01:04:23.859 --> 01:04:30.539
Gloria Steinem was in Accra, she spent some
days at the house and the children will go

01:04:30.539 --> 01:04:35.049
Auntie Gloria, Auntie Gloria, Auntie Gloria
and then my son said, "Wow, we have even white

01:04:35.049 --> 01:04:36.049
aunties."

01:04:36.049 --> 01:04:40.150
That's your wahalla as the Nigerians would
say.

01:04:40.150 --> 01:04:46.420
But one of my white nieces tell the story
or I'm told the story about her campus of

01:04:46.420 --> 01:04:49.289
how the only thing they do there is hooking
up.

01:04:49.289 --> 01:04:53.989
[pause] So I said, "So what is hooking up?"

01:04:53.989 --> 01:04:56.591
"So Miss Leymah, you hook up, you hook up."

01:04:56.591 --> 01:04:58.910
So hooking up is sex.

01:04:58.910 --> 01:05:05.369
They don't have relationships like boyfriend
and girlfriend anymore where they sit and

01:05:05.369 --> 01:05:11.049
talk and get to know each other, so I see
you, I like you, we hook up and you like me,

01:05:11.049 --> 01:05:12.049
we hook up.

01:05:12.049 --> 01:05:14.940
And in order to be in you have to hook up.

01:05:14.940 --> 01:05:15.940
Oh my God.

01:05:15.940 --> 01:05:21.719
[Megan murmurs in response] So I think there
is a road as part of your corporate social

01:05:21.719 --> 01:05:26.089
responsibility not just to America but to
the world.

01:05:26.089 --> 01:05:27.890
You have the technology.

01:05:27.890 --> 01:05:35.199
Can I kindly shoot myself in the foot again,
open my big mouth to say, can you do a YouTube

01:05:35.199 --> 01:05:41.759
video profiling the young people, young women
specifically who work in this decent institution,

01:05:41.759 --> 01:05:50.579
let them talk about their, you have all these
scientists and techy girls and, and they are

01:05:50.579 --> 01:05:53.740
not ugly, see you, you can pass for a beauty
queen.

01:05:53.740 --> 01:05:58.170
[audience laughs] You, you can be Miss India.

01:05:58.170 --> 01:06:02.400
I mean you are beautiful people and even the
young men here.

01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:04.779
I haven't seen anyone with their sagging pants.

01:06:04.779 --> 01:06:05.779
[laughter]

01:06:05.779 --> 01:06:09.819
&gt;&gt;Leymah Gbowee: Even if your pants are sagging,
we will not be looking at that other part,

01:06:09.819 --> 01:06:14.339
we will look at your brain because you, too,
are doing something to keep the wheels of

01:06:14.339 --> 01:06:16.420
this place functioning.

01:06:16.420 --> 01:06:17.640
The world is upside down.

01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:21.099
&gt;&gt;Megan Smith: You are here in Silicon Valley
in the heart of entrepreneurship where people

01:06:21.099 --> 01:06:26.239
are driven by passion to make the world better
to be entrepreneurs, to do great things in

01:06:26.239 --> 01:06:28.569
science and math together with the arts are
really are--

01:06:28.569 --> 01:06:32.540
&gt;&gt;Leymah Gbowee: You need to take it out of
Silicon Valley because I, I'm telling you

01:06:32.540 --> 01:06:35.959
in the other valleys it's all about sex.

01:06:35.959 --> 01:06:36.959
[laughter]

01:06:36.959 --> 01:06:40.079
&gt;&gt;Leymah Gbowee: It is really very serious.

01:06:40.079 --> 01:06:45.269
When a 13-year old come to her mother and
say, "I found a boy and I fell in love."

01:06:45.269 --> 01:06:46.660
Oh my God.

01:06:46.660 --> 01:06:52.819
Another friend told me her 13-year old was
asking her to buy her thongs.

01:06:52.819 --> 01:06:53.819
[pause]

01:06:53.819 --> 01:06:55.059
&gt;&gt;female #5: Thongs.

01:06:55.059 --> 01:06:56.740
&gt;&gt;female #6: What?

01:06:56.740 --> 01:06:58.420
&gt;&gt;female #5: Thongs.

01:06:58.420 --> 01:07:00.109
&gt;&gt;Leymah Gbowee: Thongs.

01:07:00.109 --> 01:07:01.109
You know that thing?

01:07:01.109 --> 01:07:02.109
&gt;&gt;female #6: Yeah.

01:07:02.109 --> 01:07:04.150
&gt;&gt;Megan Smith: You know the interesting thing
that Geena, Geena Davis, the actress who was

01:07:04.150 --> 01:07:07.189
in Thelma and Louise and won, academy award
winning actress, has done some research about

01:07:07.189 --> 01:07:13.140
media for very, very young children and her
discovery with some work with USC Annenberg

01:07:13.140 --> 01:07:18.210
Center is that in the film and television
that's made for zero to six year olds in the

01:07:18.210 --> 01:07:24.170
U.S. and which is exported in many places,
it's amazing to look at the statistics maybe

01:07:24.170 --> 01:07:29.789
on screen it's three to one boys to girls
and the jobs that are held by the characters,

01:07:29.789 --> 01:07:35.400
80 percent of the jobs held, for if your,
your child is watching TV in these shows are

01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:42.799
held by men and the 20 percent that are held
by women characters are you know there's no

01:07:42.799 --> 01:07:44.579
lawyers, there's no scientists, there's no
businesswomen.

01:07:44.579 --> 01:07:50.819
You know you take a wonderful movie like Nemo,
Finding Nemo, how many girls in the ocean?

01:07:50.819 --> 01:07:51.819
One.

01:07:51.819 --> 01:07:53.160
That's just not true.

01:07:53.160 --> 01:07:57.609
And so by the time you're three you're learning
this in fact to the point of sexuality is

01:07:57.609 --> 01:08:01.799
that when you only have one character, girl
character on screen, they sexualize her.

01:08:01.799 --> 01:08:02.799
&gt;&gt;Leymah Gbowee: Um hmm.

01:08:02.799 --> 01:08:06.400
&gt;&gt;Megan Smith: And so you can go to the Smurfs
and you see all these different kinds of boys

01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:10.890
including the nerdy boy or nerdy, you know,
girl who was a girl who would work at Google

01:08:10.890 --> 01:08:18.369
and, and build these tech careers, but the
one girl is the Barbie girl, you know and

01:08:18.369 --> 01:08:22.849
so sexification of, of young children, pulling
them into that I think there's a lot of, your

01:08:22.849 --> 01:08:26.109
point is very well taken about telling these
stories better in the media.

01:08:26.109 --> 01:08:29.690
&gt;&gt;Leymah Gbowee: Please do, please because
if you don't I will do my own YouTube video

01:08:29.690 --> 01:08:32.650
and say YouTube why are you not doing this?

01:08:32.650 --> 01:08:35.120
Because this is something that we could do.

01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:38.029
This is so, this is so, let me conclude with
my advocacy.

01:08:38.029 --> 01:08:40.069
&gt;&gt;Megan Smith: We would love that.

01:08:40.069 --> 01:08:41.069
Great.

01:08:41.069 --> 01:08:45.480
&gt;&gt;Leymah Gbowee: Let Google not only should
you show kids, young women with brains here

01:08:45.480 --> 01:08:49.130
to inspire other young women.

01:08:49.130 --> 01:08:52.579
Tell them that I got this job based on merit.

01:08:52.579 --> 01:08:53.579
&gt;&gt;Megan Smith: Right.

01:08:53.579 --> 01:08:56.310
&gt;&gt;Leymah Gbowee: And not sex.

01:08:56.310 --> 01:09:02.940
I am where I am based on my brains and not
my body even though the b spells the same

01:09:02.940 --> 01:09:05.600
thing.

01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:08.199
And then reach out to other communities.

01:09:08.199 --> 01:09:15.040
Can you girls in this place start your own
revolution beyond Silicon Valley and start

01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:17.779
showcasing yourself.

01:09:17.779 --> 01:09:23.529
Someone asked me if you met Beyonce what would
you do, would you ask her for an autograph?

01:09:23.529 --> 01:09:30.349
I said no, I will ask her to come and join
me in my campaign because I want her to sit

01:09:30.349 --> 01:09:35.080
and tell young girls beyond their booty shake,
I have a brain.

01:09:35.080 --> 01:09:40.130
[someone's cellphone rings] Because they don't
understand that part.

01:09:40.130 --> 01:09:46.349
And I would want, if I ever met Jay-Z, I would
want to tell him to tell young boys beyond

01:09:46.349 --> 01:09:50.199
the yo, yo, yo, I have a brain, that's why
I am a business genius.

01:09:50.199 --> 01:09:51.779
&gt;&gt;Megan Smith: There's this side of it, yeah.

01:09:51.779 --> 01:09:52.779
Very much.

01:09:52.779 --> 01:09:57.050
&gt;&gt;Leymah Gbowee: So I think there's so much
that we all can do to make this world a better

01:09:57.050 --> 01:09:58.090
place.

01:09:58.090 --> 01:10:01.570
My story is from a tiny part of the world.

01:10:01.570 --> 01:10:08.300
Your story is from this gigantic place and
you can use your space to do good.

01:10:08.300 --> 01:10:10.409
Google, join me.

01:10:10.409 --> 01:10:11.670
Let's change our world.

01:10:11.670 --> 01:10:12.670
Thank you all for coming to this interview.

01:10:12.670 --> 01:10:13.670
&gt;&gt;Megan Smith: Leymah Gbowee

01:10:13.670 --> 01:10:13.671
[applause]
