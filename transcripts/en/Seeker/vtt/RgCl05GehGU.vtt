00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:09.030
Is it possible netflix and chill could lead
to hulu and commitment?

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.440
Hello binge watchers, Julian here for DNews.

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.860
Thanks to online streaming services like Netflix,
Hulu, and Discovery Go, it’s never been

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.510
easier to watch an episode of your favorite
show.

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:19.510
And then another.

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:20.510
And then another.

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:21.510
And then it’s 4 am, seriously?

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.571
And while marathoning 3 seasons in one sitting
may be awful for your circadian rhythm, it

00:00:26.571 --> 00:00:29.960
may actually be beneficial, provided you’re
not doing it alone.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.870
A new study published in the Journal of Social
and Personal Relationships surveyed 259 college

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.730
students, asking them how much media they
shared with their partner and how close they

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:39.730
felt to them.

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.120
The results showed that people who shared
more media with their significant others were

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.330
more likely to report they felt closer and
more committed to them.

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.830
That’s not particularly surprising; if you
have shared interests, it’s easy to bond

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:50.830
over them.

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:54.300
But the survey also asked participants how
many friends they shared with their partner,

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.600
leading to the most interesting insight.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.860
Results showed that the fewer friends a couple
had in common, the more impact sharing a favorite

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.490
show, movie, or book had on how close they
felt to each other.

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:08.179
Lead author Sarah Gomillion proposed that
this is because the characters in these shows,

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:12.210
movies, and books serve as substitutes for
a common friends circle, compensating for

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.329
their lack of a social reality with a social
fiction.

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:19.880
Interestingly, the desire to share other activities,
like a dinner date, was unaffected by how

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.689
many friends the couple had in common, further
suggesting that the characters in the movies,

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:27.840
shows or books were indeed serving as a replacement
for a common friends group.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.649
This makes sense when you look at past research
that has found couples with common friends

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:36.280
feel more connected and committed, and that
people tend to form emotional bonds with fictional

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:42.619
characters.

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:46.780
So a couple may feel the need to compensate
when they have no friends in common, say because

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.420
they met through a dating app and one invited
the other over for netflix and chill, and

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.280
before they knew it they were 5 seasons deep
in Parks and Rec and chiller than Elsa.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.389
So binge watching can make you feel like you
have friends, but that’s not always a good

00:01:59.389 --> 00:02:00.389
thing.

00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:04.700
A 2015 study by doctoral students at the University
of Texas at Austin found that people who were

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.780
lonely and depressed were more likely to binge
watch television, which can cause them to

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.460
neglect their health or other relationships.

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.750
And if someone is neglecting their health
and relationships, it stands to reason they’ll

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.450
become even more depressed and lonely, and
eventually they’ll run out of episodes and

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.560
their TV friends will be gone.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.790
Bonding with an actual human who sticks around
after the series finale could be crucial to

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.170
avoiding this.

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.110
But what if your special someone is gone,
and you miss your TV pals?

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.580
Is it alright to sneak in a few episodes without
them?

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.110
What Gomillion’s study effectively means
is when you get a few episodes of Thrones

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.260
ahead, you’re not just getting to the juicy
bits first, you’re effectively hanging out

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.040
with all your partner’s friends without
them!

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.130
Luckily someone has thought of a solution,
and that someone is -- of all someones -- the

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.340
Italian ice cream maker Cornetto.

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.490
They’ve made what they call Commitment Rings,
which sync to an app that will let you watch

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.850
shows and movies only when both rings are
present.

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.780
So if you and your partner are working your
way through Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, and

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.220
The World’s End together, you can thank
Cornetto for bringing you closer together.

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.390
Some couples may need to avoid their friends
because their relationship’s a secret.

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.190
Seeker Stories has a story about dating in
India And if you want to know about something

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.820
more scandalous that Netflix and chilling,
check out guest host Ali’s ins and outs

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.940
of sending dirty pictures.

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:25.780
How do you get closer to your significant
other?
