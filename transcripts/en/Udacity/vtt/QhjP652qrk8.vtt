00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.435
So which of the following are

00:00:01.435 --> 00:00:05.390
characteristics of network virtualization, but not necessarily

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.950
characteristics of SDN? Be careful, the distinction

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:11.530
between SDN and virtual networks was as

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:17.800
we discussed in the previous part of this lesson. Allowing multiple tenants to

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.930
share underlying physical infrastructure. Controlling behavior from

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.440
a logically centralized controller. Separating logical and

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.520
physical networks. Or separating data and control planes.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.510
Again, please feel free to check all that apply.
