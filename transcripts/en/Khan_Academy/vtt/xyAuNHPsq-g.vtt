00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.360
Let's learn about matrices.

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:05.800
What do I mean when
I say matrices?

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.430
Well, matrices is just the
plural for matrix, which is

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:11.810
probably a word you're familiar
with more because of

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:14.720
Hollywood than because
of mathematics.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:16.802
So what is a matrix?

00:00:16.802 --> 00:00:20.120
Well, it's actually a
pretty simple idea.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.250
It's just a table of numbers,
that's all a matrix is.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.740
So let me draw matrix for you.

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.820
I don't like that
toothpaste-colored blue, so

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:29.230
let me use another color.

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:30.900
So this is an example
of a matrix.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.850
I'm going to pick some random
numbers out: 5, 1,

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:43.490
2, 3, 0, minus 5.

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:44.980
That is a matrix.

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:46.830
And all it is is a
table of numbers.

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.392
And often times if you wanted
to have a variable for a

00:00:49.392 --> 00:00:52.530
matrix, you'd use a capital
letter, so you could use a

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.180
capital A, and sometimes in some
books, they make it extra

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.650
bold, so like a bold A
would be a matrix.

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:03.990
And just a little bit of
notation, so we would call

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:06.640
this matrix, just by convention,
you would call

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.950
this a 2-by-3 matrix.

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.220
And sometimes they actually
write it, 2 by 3, below the

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.440
bold letter they use to
represent the matrix.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.300
And what is 2 and what is 3?

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.100
Well, 2 is the number of rows.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.380
We have one row, two
rows, right?

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:21.080
This is a row.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.920
This is a row.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.310
And we have three columns:
one, two, three.

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.890
So that's why it's called
a 2-by-3 matrix.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:36.250
If I said that B-- I'll do it
extra bold-- if B is a 5-by-2

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:43.610
matrix, that means that B would
have--- I'll just type

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.870
in numbers: 0, minus 5, 10.

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:51.620
So it has five rows and it has
two columns, so it'll have

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:52.420
another column here.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.030
So let's see, minus 10, 3, I'm
just putting in random numbers

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.015
here-- 7, 2, pi.

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.930
That is a 5-by-2 matrix.

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.610
So I think you now have kind
of a convention that all a

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.300
matrix is is a table
of numbers.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.780
You can represent it
when you're doing

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.760
it in variable form.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.010
You represent it as a boldface
capital letter.

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.910
Sometimes you'd write
a 2 by 3 there.

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.290
And, you can actually
reference the

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:21.900
terms of the matrix.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.230
So in this example, in the top
example where we have matrix

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.780
A, if someone wanted to
reference this element of the

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.380
matrix, so what is that?

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.780
That is in the second row.

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.900
It's in row 2 and it's
in column 2, right?

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.910
This is column 1, this
is column 2.

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.520
This is row 1, row 2.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.250
So it's in the second
row, second column.

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:51.470
So sometimes people will write
that A, and they'll write 2

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:57.500
comma 2 is equal to 0.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:03.180
Or sometimes they'll write it as
a lowercase A 2 comma 2 is

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.430
equal to 0.

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.660
These are just the same thing.

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.250
I'm just doing this to expose
you to the notation, because a

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.080
lot of this really
is just notation.

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:20.710
So what is a 1 comma 3?

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:23.620
Well, that means we're in the
first row, the third column.

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.770
First row, one, two, three, it's
this value right here.

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:28.230
So that equals 2.

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.090
So this is just all notation
of what a matrix is.

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.025
It's a table of numbers that
can be represented this way

00:03:33.025 --> 00:03:35.830
and we can represent it as
different elements that way.

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.250
So you might be asking, Sal,
well, that's nice.

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.040
A table of numbers with fancy
words and fancy notations, but

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.150
what is it good for?

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.250
And that's the interesting
point.

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.120
A matrix is just a data
representation.

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.550
It's just a way of writing
down data.

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:51.230
That's all it is.

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.890
it's a table of numbers, but it
can be used to represent a

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:56.180
whole set of phenomenon.

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.280
And if soon. you're doing this
in your Algebra I or your

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.560
Algebra II class, you're
probably using it to represent

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:02.620
linear equations.

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.490
But we'll learn later-- and I'll
do a whole set of videos

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:08.530
on applying matrices
to a whole bunch

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:09.140
of different things.

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:13.440
But it can represent-- it's very
powerful and if you're

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.459
doing computer graphics on a
matrix, the elements can

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:18.370
represent pixels
on your screen.

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.490
They can represent points
in coordinate space.

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:22.079
They can represent--
who knows?

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:23.880
There's tons of things that
they can represent.

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.700
But the important thing to
realize is that a matrix, it's

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.400
not a natural phenomenon.

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.100
It's not like a lot of the
mathematical concepts we've

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.710
been looking at.

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:37.570
It's a way to represent a
mathematical concept or a way

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.360
of representing values, but
you kind of have to define

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.920
what it's representing.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.980
But let's put that on the back
burner a little bit in terms

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:47.380
of what it actually
represents.

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:48.430
Oh, my wife is here.

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.690
She's looking for our
filing cabinet.

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:52.870
But anyway, back to
what I was doing.

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:56.150
So let's put on the back
burner what a matrix is

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.230
actually representing and let's
learn the convention.

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:01.300
Because I think, at least
initially, that tends to be

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:01.960
the hardest part.

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.350
How do you add matrices?

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:04.880
How do you multiply matrices?

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.230
How do you invert matrices?

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:08.070
How do you find the determinant
of matrices?

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:10.430
All of those words might sound
unfamiliar unless you've

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:12.790
already been confused by them
in your algebra class.

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:15.140
I'm going to teach you all of
those things first, which are

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:17.850
all just really human-defined
conventions, and then later

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:21.450
on, I'll make a whole bunch of
videos on the intuition behind

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:23.550
them and what they actually
represent.

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:25.700
So let's get started.

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:28.680
So let's say I wanted to
add these two matrices.

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.920
Let's say the first one-- and
let me switch colors.

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:36.740
I'll do relatively small ones,
just so as not to waste space.

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:45.320
Say I have the matrix
3, negative 1, 2 0.

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:49.170
Let's call that A, capital A.

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:53.360
Let's say matrix B, and I'm
just making up numbers.

00:05:53.360 --> 00:06:05.330
Matrix B is equal to
minus 7, 2, 3, 5.

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:14.010
So my question to you is what
is A-- so I'm doing it bold

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:16.950
like they do in the textbooks--
plus matrix B?

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:20.210
So I'm adding two matrices.

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:22.310
And once again, this is
just human convention.

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:24.770
Someone defined how
matrices add.

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:26.530
They could've defined it some
other way, but they said we're

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:29.120
going to make matrices add the
way I'm about to show you,

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.460
because it's useful for a
whole set of phenomena.

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:34.620
So when you add two matrices,
you essentially just add the

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:36.060
corresponding elements.

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:38.900
So how does that work?

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:41.820
Well, you add the element that
is in row 1, column 1 to the

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:43.940
elements in row 1,
column 1, right?

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:45.700
So it's 3 plus minus 7.

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:51.560
That'll be the 1, 1 element.

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:54.230
Then the row 1, column
2 element will be

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:57.930
minus 1 plus 2.

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:00.380
Let me put parentheses around
them so you know these are

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:02.270
separate elements.

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:04.550
And you can guess how
this keeps going.

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:12.950
This element will be 2 plus
3 and this last element

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:14.200
will be 0 plus 5.

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:23.640
So that equals 3 plus minus 7.

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:25.196
That is minus 4.

00:07:25.196 --> 00:07:28.690
Minus 1 plus 2, that's 1.

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:32.660
2 plus 3 is 5, and
0 plus 5 is 5.

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:33.820
So there we have it.

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:37.240
That is how we humans
have defined the

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:38.860
addition of two matrices.

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:41.170
And by this definition, you
could imagine that this is

00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:46.560
going to be the same thing
as B plus A, right?

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:47.800
And remember, this is something
we have to think

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:51.180
about because we're not adding
numbers anymore.

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:53.550
You know 1 plus 2 is the same
thing you is 2 plus 1, or you

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:55.710
know any two normal numbers, it
doesn't matter what order

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:56.620
you add them in.

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:58.790
But with matrices, it's not
completely obvious.

00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:01.070
But when you define it in this
way, it doesn't matter if we

00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:02.620
do A plus B or B
plus A, right?

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:05.290
If we did B plus A, this would
just say negative 7 plus 3.

00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:06.640
This would say 2 plus
negative 1.

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:09.270
But it would come out
to the same values.

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:10.890
That is matrix addition.

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:13.580
And you could imagine, matrix
subtraction, it's essentially

00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:14.530
the same thing.

00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:15.500
Well, actually let
me show you.

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:16.750
What would be A minus B?

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:31.670
Well, this is capital B with the
matrix, so I'm making it

00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:32.240
extra bold.

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:39.370
Well, that's the same thing
as A plus minus 1 times B.

00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:40.510
And what's B?

00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:46.150
Well, B is minus 7, 2, 3, 5.

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:48.010
When you multiply a scalar,
when you just multiply a

00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:50.260
number times a matrix, you just
multiply the number times

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:51.610
every one of it's elements.

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:57.160
So that equals A, matrix
A, plus the matrix.

00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:00.160
We just multiply this negative 1
times every element in here.

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:06.330
So 7, minus 2, minus 3, and 5.

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:08.530
And then we can do what
we did up there.

00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:13.870
And we know what A is, so this
would equal-- A is up here, so

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:16.340
3 plus 7 is 10.

00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:21.940
Negative 1 plus negative 2 is
minus 3, 2 plus minus 3 is

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:27.625
minus 1, and 0 plus 5 is 5.

00:09:27.625 --> 00:09:29.100
Now, you didn't even have
to go through this

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:29.820
exercise right here.

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:32.300
You could have literally just
subtracted these elements from

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:34.150
these elements, and you would
have gotten the same value.

00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:37.780
I did this because I wanted to
show you also that multiplying

00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:41.220
a scalar or just a value or a
number times a matrix is just

00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:43.830
multiplying that number
times all of the

00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:45.410
elements of the matrix.

00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:48.350
And so by this definition
of matrix

00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:49.770
addition, what do we know?

00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:52.490
Well, we know that both matrices
have to be the same

00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:55.250
size by this definition,
the way we're adding.

00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:58.470
So, for example, you could
add these two matrices.

00:09:58.470 --> 00:10:09.090
You could add 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 8, 9 to this matrix, to

00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:14.120
minus 10, minus 100, minus
1000-- I'm making up numbers--

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:18.950
1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1.

00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:20.660
You can add these two
matrices, right?

00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:22.980
Because they have the same
number of rows and same number

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:23.930
of columns.

00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:27.040
So for example, if you were to
add them, the first term up

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:30.950
here would be 1 plus minus 10,
so it would be minus 9.

00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:33.520
2 plus minus 100 is minus 98.

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:34.740
I think you get the point.

00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:38.170
You would have exactly nine
elements and you would have

00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:40.190
three rows and three columns.

00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:42.550
But you could not add
these two matrices.

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:45.700
You could not add-- Let me do
it in a different color just

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:47.210
so it's different.

00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:49.380
You could not add this blue.

00:10:49.380 --> 00:11:02.220
You could not add this matrix:
minus 3, 2 to the matrix 9, 7.

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:03.830
And why can you not add them?

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:05.590
Well, they don't have
corresponding

00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:06.560
elements to add up.

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:11.710
This is a one row by two column,
this is 1 by 2, and

00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:13.370
this is 2 by 1.

00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:15.860
So they don't have the same
dimensions so we can't add or

00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:17.700
subtract these matrices.

00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:21.330
And this is a side note, when a
matrix has-- when one of its

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:25.850
dimensions is one-- so, for
example, here you have one row

00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:29.090
and multiple columns, this is
actually called a row vector.

00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:31.540
A vector is essentially a
one-dimensional matrix where

00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:33.190
one of the dimensions is one.

00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:35.270
So this is a row vector,
and similarly,

00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:36.700
this is a column vector.

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:39.230
That's just a little extra
terminology you should know.

00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:41.820
If you take linear algebra and
calculus, your professor might

00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:43.810
use those terms and it's good
to be familiar with it.

00:11:43.810 --> 00:11:46.840
But anyway, I'm pushing 11
minutes, so I will continue

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:48.080
this in the next video.

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:49.330
