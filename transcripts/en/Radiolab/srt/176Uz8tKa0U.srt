1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:03,450
This is Radiolab on Jad
Abumrad. A couple days ago,

2
00:00:03,451 --> 00:00:07,800
Joe Frank passed away one of
the greats in our business.

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:11,910
Huge inspiration for me. But a
guy whose work you may not know,

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:17,070
he was one of the originals.
Nobody told stories like Joe Frank,

5
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:21,990
nobody tells stories like Joe Frank,
no one. He, he is still anyhow,

6
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:22,883
you know what I'm gonna do.

7
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:27,890
I want to take this podcast to play for
you a little bit of his work cause it's

8
00:00:28,501 --> 00:00:31,530
so good. It's so good.
And also play for you.

9
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:35,850
A few conversations I've had recently
about Joe Frank and the impact of that

10
00:00:35,851 --> 00:00:38,190
work starting with, um,

11
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:41,490
a conversation I had with Brooke
Gladstone from on the media.

12
00:00:41,491 --> 00:00:46,110
She recently interviewed me about, uh,
the impact that show had on radio lab,

13
00:00:46,111 --> 00:00:47,790
which is significant.
So let's start there.

14
00:00:47,791 --> 00:00:51,210
This is an excerpt of a conversation that
I had with Brooke Gladstone that they

15
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:55,530
use for on the media. And I
believe it starts with a clip. Hey,

16
00:00:55,531 --> 00:00:59,760
let me play a clip or maybe a
couple of them get your reaction

17
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:12,910
[inaudible]

18
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:15,610
when you hug people goodbye
after a social event,

19
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:18,790
perhaps a dinner party
or a gallery opening,

20
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:23,860
there was always that moment when they
squeeze you more forcefully than before.

21
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:28,060
A polite way of letting you
know they are about to withdraw.

22
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:33,900
Usually the one who disengages
first is the one who cares less.

23
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:39,130
When this used to happen to me,
I felt rejected and humiliated.

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,470
I'd come home with a lonely,

25
00:01:41,471 --> 00:01:46,471
sick feeling and that's why in order to
assume the power position and gain the

26
00:01:47,531 --> 00:01:51,370
psychological advantage, I
now hug people very briefly,

27
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,060
perhaps one or two seconds
before freeing myself.

28
00:01:55,870 --> 00:02:00,610
Sometimes if I detect any resistance,
I'll push the person away.

29
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:02,290
In one instance,

30
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:06,820
I caused a woman to fall backwards
over a chair injuring her back,

31
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:11,320
which led to her hospitalization,
but I have no choice.

32
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:14,920
It was a matter of self preservation.

33
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:22,800
That is classic Joe
Frey. It's really, really

34
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,650
good writing. You know, he
writes these like scenarios.

35
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:28,650
They're like demented talk
of the towns in the way,

36
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,220
like they're just these little
fragments of dark experience,

37
00:02:32,221 --> 00:02:35,820
which are beautifully realized.
Very vivid, kind of funny,

38
00:02:35,821 --> 00:02:37,200
but kind of also troubling.

39
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:42,000
How do you think he influenced you?

40
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:47,130
Because you are always a great
producer, always technically adept.

41
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:51,210
You had tons of musical
composition training,

42
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:54,240
you understood the rhythmic
possibilities of radio.

43
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:58,410
What did he do that you don't think
you could've done without him?

44
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:00,610
It's a lot of different things.

45
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,770
This was way at the beginning for me when
radio lab was just a three hour thing

46
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:10,180
on the am station one back, how far
we're going back to the stone age.

47
00:03:10,181 --> 00:03:14,770
So January, February, 2002 somewhere
around there. Really at the beginning.

48
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:18,400
And everybody here who knows the
beginning of radio lab knows that I didn't

49
00:03:18,401 --> 00:03:21,370
deserve that show. It was just too soon.
And I didn't know what I was doing.

50
00:03:21,371 --> 00:03:23,320
I didn't have a style. I had this,

51
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:27,520
I had the like unfortunate thing that
we all had back in 2002 is that I would

52
00:03:27,521 --> 00:03:30,130
just want it to be IRA glass. Everybody
wanted to be hourglass. Right?

53
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,980
And I was still trying to figure
out like, okay, so who am I?

54
00:03:32,981 --> 00:03:35,410
What do I want my stuff to sound like?

55
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:39,490
And so I would every Sunday night
I'd have to put it three hours.

56
00:03:39,491 --> 00:03:41,530
And it was an anthology
show at that point.

57
00:03:41,531 --> 00:03:45,430
And it was literally take the
best documentaries from the BBC,

58
00:03:45,431 --> 00:03:49,810
the CBC in Canada, the ABC in
Australia, radio, Netherlands,

59
00:03:49,811 --> 00:03:54,130
all the stuff and packaged them
into three continuous hours.

60
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:56,710
And I would sort of narrate in
and out of different segments.

61
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:01,120
And so from eight to 11 I'd be playing
my show and I was bored hopping at the

62
00:04:01,121 --> 00:04:05,170
time, which means I wasn't just making
the thing, but I had to sit at the board,

63
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,760
hit play on the CD,

64
00:04:06,761 --> 00:04:10,060
and then between hour one an
hour to an hour to an hour three,

65
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,040
I would have to say the weather, right?

66
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:16,000
So I was doing the whole
thing and after me,

67
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:19,290
Joe Frank would come on and
he was part of my shift.

68
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:21,210
And every time I'd just be like,

69
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,630
what the F is this stuff?

70
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:28,140
I would just be sitting there listening
to him and just like amazed and like

71
00:04:28,141 --> 00:04:32,810
mentally taking notes, being like,
oh, this guy has a feel and a,

72
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:37,680
there's a surreality and a disorienting
newness to his stuff that I just just

73
00:04:37,681 --> 00:04:40,560
really fascinated by and I was like,
oh, I want to, I want to do that.

74
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:43,800
Can we play that one that
we said that we can't play?

75
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:53,500
[inaudible] there was a time when I
danced on a street corner dressed as a

76
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:58,390
chicken. My job was to draw attention
to a furniture store down the block.

77
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:03,580
One evening when my shift was over
still wearing my chicken outfit,

78
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:08,680
I walked into a bar across the
street. I ordered a Bombay Martini,

79
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:11,260
straight up olives on the side.

80
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:13,930
A prostitute sat down next to me.

81
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:18,850
She was young Willoway at a
far away look in her eyes.

82
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,680
Her name was Meredith. We
talked about our careers,

83
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:28,210
the importance of networking,
setting goals, focus.

84
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:32,290
Then I excused myself,
walked into the men's room,

85
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:37,390
entered a stall and sat down on the
toilet and had a bowel movement.

86
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:40,720
The broken tube and half of it
was still hanging out of me.

87
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:45,850
So I had to wipe myself 50
times repeatedly checking
to see if there was more

88
00:05:45,851 --> 00:05:50,680
left on the toilet paper and
written on the wall with the words,

89
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:56,220
know that someone is suffering anonymously
and unknown and that by the time you

90
00:05:56,561 --> 00:05:57,394
read this,

91
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:58,953
I'll be dead.

92
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:07,520
Oh, that's good. That's really good. Wow.

93
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:11,660
There's nothing wrong with
playing that clip. Actually.

94
00:06:11,661 --> 00:06:14,120
He's not using any bad
words. True. I mean,

95
00:06:14,121 --> 00:06:19,121
there's no FCC violations
there and it's simply growth.

96
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:25,210
And yet you tell me that there was this
person on the planet too that hasn't,

97
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,410
Joe Frank always had the quality of like
he's coming from inside your head out

98
00:06:33,411 --> 00:06:35,720
and then back in again. He
has that kind of quality,

99
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,240
which it sounds like he's somehow
like the voice in your head,

100
00:06:38,241 --> 00:06:42,050
but broadcast back into your head. Um,
I, there's something about that quality,

101
00:06:42,051 --> 00:06:45,410
which like I, that's what I want from
the radio. It's what I want from podcast.

102
00:06:45,411 --> 00:06:48,020
I want someone to be speaking
from inside me in a way.

103
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:51,400
Have you ever talked about Joe Frank too?

104
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:57,260
I give this talk 30 40 times a year
where I have like an extended Joe Frank

105
00:06:58,021 --> 00:07:02,770
excerpt. I have an image of Joe Frank
that I show a, yeah, all the time.

106
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:07,870
The vast majority of our listeners
of the people listening to this,

107
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:12,490
I'm going to have to assume they never
heard of Joe Frank and he was always

108
00:07:12,491 --> 00:07:14,140
available on podcast,

109
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:19,440
but he was like this mystery to people
who weren't willing to sort of follow the

110
00:07:22,841 --> 00:07:24,940
breadcrumbs to him. You
know, I'll tell you,

111
00:07:24,941 --> 00:07:26,830
I mean when I give this talk that I,

112
00:07:26,831 --> 00:07:31,420
that I often give and I go through the
series of people who've influenced me.

113
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:35,480
I'll always ask any Joe Frank fans in
the house, these will be like audiences,

114
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:40,220
but 2020 500 people and like
one time someone clapped.

115
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:44,300
One time I remember like there was a
clap in the far right and I was like,

116
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,010
oh my God, a Joe Frank Fan.

117
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:50,630
It always broke my heart a little bit
because no one ever knew his stuff.

118
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:55,310
Like amongst us, our little sort of
posse radio people. He's a legend,

119
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:58,550
but nobody on the outside
ever knew him. You know,

120
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:01,220
this is going to be their chance. Yeah.

121
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:06,770
[inaudible]

122
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:09,200
last night I dreamt I
was lost on an elevator.

123
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:11,780
All the floors were the same.

124
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:15,560
Then I realized the elevator
was moving horizontally,

125
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:20,210
so I tried another
elevator, but the express,

126
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,660
but it just got me more lost faster.

127
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,020
People kept getting on and getting off.

128
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:30,770
They were all wearing green galls over
their heads and we're smoking ice cream

129
00:08:30,771 --> 00:08:34,400
cones. I said, please let
me off of 39th street,

130
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:37,490
and the conductor said,
this is 35th street.

131
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,890
You'll have to walk three
blocks and take the escalator.

132
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:44,150
But when I got to the escalator,
it was just a phone booth.

133
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:48,260
So I made a call. I called my father,

134
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:53,810
I said hello and lost on 39th street
looking for an escalator and I can't find

135
00:08:53,811 --> 00:08:56,280
it anywhere. And he said,

136
00:08:57,150 --> 00:09:00,570
I'll be right there and there he wants.

137
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:05,940
And the phone booth started moving forward
very slowly with my father and I in

138
00:09:05,941 --> 00:09:09,750
it. And I didn't know where it
was going or why. And he said,

139
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:15,090
don't be afraid. This phone booth
will take us home. And I said,

140
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:18,990
but we have no home. And he said,

141
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:24,480
we live on the eighth floor
apartment. Why? And I said,

142
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:29,400
why? And he said, yes.

143
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,553
[inaudible]

144
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:47,950
that was a condensed version
of a conversation I had
with Brooke Gladstone for

145
00:09:47,951 --> 00:09:48,784
on the media.

146
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:54,080
You can find the full
conversation on the media.org.

147
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:56,290
Okay,

148
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:59,170
well return with one more Joe Frank
recollection in just a moment.

149
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:01,850
This is Michael Barrels
from Portland, Oregon.

153
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,950
Hey, uh, Simon Adler here. Uh,

154
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:22,210
I'm one of the producers here at Radiolab
and I wanted to take a quick second to

155
00:10:22,211 --> 00:10:25,300
tell you about something that, uh, that
I think is pretty interesting that,

156
00:10:25,301 --> 00:10:29,980
that we make here, uh, besides
the show. So we have a newsletter,

157
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:33,010
which I know everyone
does, but hear me out.

158
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:36,040
Unlike a lot of other
newsletters out there, uh,

159
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:40,810
we don't waste your time by just blabbing
about what our next release will be or

160
00:10:40,811 --> 00:10:44,890
begging you for money. Uh, actually
we, we do a little bit of that,

161
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:49,900
but what we also do is each
time a new episode drops,

162
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:55,120
we send you a list of staff picks,
essentially a collection of things.

163
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:59,200
The folks here who make this show have
come across recently and are excited

164
00:10:59,201 --> 00:11:03,610
about, uh, they range from books and
music to TV shows, youtube clips,

165
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:04,870
art exhibits, blogs.

166
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:08,680
It's sort of a repository for this
stuff that's got us interested.

167
00:11:08,681 --> 00:11:13,360
But for whatever reason, uh, we're not
sure how to turn into a radio story.

168
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,360
So if that sounds
interesting to you at all,

169
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:18,910
I hope you'll sign up for our newsletter.

202
00:13:22,011 --> 00:13:25,160
We're paying tribute to
Joe Frank in this podcast.

203
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:30,110
Joe Unfortunately lost a battle with
colon cancer just a few days ago after my

204
00:13:30,111 --> 00:13:33,140
conversation with Brooke
Gladstone from on the media. Um,

205
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,010
I ended up having later that same day
another conversation about Joe Frank,

206
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:42,950
this time with IRA glass from
this American life. Hello.

207
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:46,970
Hey. How's it going, man? It's
going okay. It's good. Okay.

208
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:52,030
We can do better line reading. There
were two entirely different. Okay.

209
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:54,770
It's just done for the purposes
of this conversation I'm doing.

210
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:59,510
I'm doing just all right. Hey,
did you know Joe Frank? No,

211
00:13:59,511 --> 00:14:01,850
I had one interaction with
Joe Frank, which was, um,

212
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:05,960
it was almost perfectly
Joe Frank in that, uh,

213
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,260
I met him once at third coast and he,

214
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:12,980
I asked him something and he looked at
me for a long time and then just walked

215
00:14:12,981 --> 00:14:17,860
away without speaking. And that
was my one Joe Frank interaction.

216
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,040
So do you remember what you asked him?

217
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:26,630
I think I might have said something
utterly like not my place cause I had just

218
00:14:26,631 --> 00:14:27,710
started the show and I was like, Hey,

219
00:14:27,711 --> 00:14:31,790
if you have any work that you
want to like, you know, get on,

220
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,830
get on the show, let me know.

221
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:38,750
And he just looked at me like you
have the goal and just walked away.

222
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:43,070
And so that was it. Yeah.
Yeah. That's showed you.

223
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:46,520
So what do you remember about him?
I'm curious like what, what you saw,

224
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:50,180
cause you, you worked with him,
right? Yeah. Basically when I was,

225
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:52,250
when I was 20, uh,

226
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:57,280
I had my first paid job at MPR and I
was the production assistant to this guy

227
00:14:57,441 --> 00:15:01,730
whose job it was to invent new
ways to, to do radio for NPR.

228
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:04,820
And he had a regular show and he would
do different things in different weeks

229
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:05,011
and,

230
00:15:05,011 --> 00:15:08,690
and he brought Joe Frank down from New
York and that was the thing we were doing

231
00:15:08,691 --> 00:15:09,290
for awhile.

232
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:14,290
And I was Joe's production assistant
as my very first paid job at NPR.

233
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:17,840
And I had never heard them on the
radio. I mean, he wasn't like, you know,

234
00:15:17,841 --> 00:15:19,940
on national radio. So, um,

235
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:24,590
they have like a few various
specific memories for sure. And um,

236
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,140
the best way I can explain it is like, um,

237
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:31,220
I've had the experience a number of times
over the years where people tried to

238
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:35,930
tell me like, oh, the first
time I heard your show was this.

239
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:38,030
And generally the thing they're
trying to say to me is like,

240
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:41,810
I didn't know that the radio could
do that. You know what I mean?

241
00:15:41,811 --> 00:15:44,540
Like I didn't realize it. Like, oh, radio
could be like, tell a story like that.

242
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:48,380
No, it feel like this. And I
myself had that exact experience.

243
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:52,250
And the person who I had it
with was Joe Frank. And um,

244
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,000
and I remember there was a day early on
and I was standing in the old control

245
00:15:58,221 --> 00:16:02,720
room at MPRs original studios. Like
the original two studios they had,

246
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:07,190
there was a studio one studio two on
the first floor of 2020 m street and we

247
00:16:07,191 --> 00:16:11,030
were in studio two and I was standing
by the reel to reel tape machine,

248
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,680
you know, the Bank of them.

249
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:16,820
And I remember Joe was telling one of
his stories and I remember feeling like,

250
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:21,080
Oh, I've never, I've
never heard this before.

251
00:16:21,081 --> 00:16:25,790
I just remember feeling like, like this,
like this thing, like I, and, and, and,

252
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:30,791
and it just sorta like to feel like
totally caught up in a story and you don't

253
00:16:31,461 --> 00:16:35,240
exactly know why you're so caught up with
it and you don't know where it's going

254
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:40,460
and, uh, and you just want to stay
with it in the sound of his voice.

255
00:16:40,461 --> 00:16:43,610
He's such like an
incredible radio performer,

256
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:47,240
like much better than you
or me. You know what I mean?

257
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:50,720
Like do you remember what the story
was that you were listening to?

258
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:53,120
I don't remember which
specific story it was.

259
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:56,660
I do remember I have gone back because
there was one story in particular called

260
00:16:56,661 --> 00:16:57,494
the elevator.

261
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:58,351
Then in fact,

262
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:03,351
I've gone and dug up that I
remember at the time I thought like,

263
00:17:03,811 --> 00:17:07,980
this is it. This sums up the whole
thing and literally what it is,

264
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:11,910
I'm riding up the elevator of my
building is he gets on an elevator.

265
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:15,990
I'm standing there sharing the small
space with a terrific looking girl.

266
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:20,460
He totally gets a crush on this
woman, but I feel shy, uncomfortable.

267
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,600
I scratch my head, I sigh,

268
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:27,390
I gaze up at the numbers of the floors,

269
00:17:27,391 --> 00:17:30,750
lighting up one after another and he
starts to imagine their life together at

270
00:17:30,751 --> 00:17:31,950
everything that they will be.

271
00:17:31,951 --> 00:17:36,951
He seems like the kind of person I really
like and he cannot bring himself to

272
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:42,720
stand there silently, not looking
at each other, say a word to her,

273
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:45,840
and so he pulls out
something from his pocket.

274
00:17:45,841 --> 00:17:49,260
I reach into my pocket and draw out
a scrap of paper, which I unfold.

275
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:53,010
It turns out to be a cash
register tape from the A and P,

276
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,020
but I scrutinize it as if it's very
important before putting it back in my

277
00:17:58,021 --> 00:18:02,610
pocket. That's a detail of the
stray I remember seeming so real.

278
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:07,920
It has a guy very magnetic forward
motion and it's like four or five minutes

279
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:11,010
long and the entire thing happens in
the elevator and he would always just

280
00:18:11,011 --> 00:18:13,890
describing the floors going up
and all the feelings he has.

281
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,810
You go through your life
looking and looking,

282
00:18:15,811 --> 00:18:19,360
and sometimes you see her though
the woman you might've loved with,

283
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:23,880
who might've loved you at a bus stop. You
know, in a museum across a smoky room,

284
00:18:23,881 --> 00:18:28,881
at a party in the lobby of a theater
online at the supermarket in an elevator.

285
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:35,440
When she leaves in a panic, you want to
run after her calling out, stop. Stop.

286
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:40,060
It's me. The person you were
meant for. Don't you recognize me?

287
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:45,400
Don't I look familiar? I
may seem like a stranger,

288
00:18:45,401 --> 00:18:49,330
but I'm the person you've been
waiting for the one in your dreams,

289
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:56,740
but you just stand there
and watch her leave.

290
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,140
This happens to me with a different
woman about once each day.

291
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:05,170
And I remember

292
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:10,670
when I was 20 hearing that and
being like, this is it. This,

293
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:14,870
this guy is doing a thing. Like I want
to know, I want to know how you do this.

294
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:22,320
Yes. For me the equivalent thing was have
you heard his rent? A family trilogy?

295
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:25,650
No. God, I'd be hard pressed
to, to summarize the story,

296
00:19:25,651 --> 00:19:29,990
but it's essentially it's this whole
world in which families can be rented. Uh,

297
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:32,430
for occasions. Well, I saw this ad

298
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:35,520
and Annie said,

299
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:39,920
rent a family. We have certain um,

300
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:44,670
package programs where an individual
can experience over the course of a 12

301
00:19:44,671 --> 00:19:48,990
month period. A pretty
considerable range of, of families.

302
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,540
Hi. Hi Christa.

303
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:55,410
It's your father from
the agency come here.

304
00:19:55,650 --> 00:20:00,600
And it's all like in his very documentary
format and it's done really well.

305
00:20:00,601 --> 00:20:04,470
So you actually sometimes like aren't
totally sure that what you're hearing is a

306
00:20:04,471 --> 00:20:06,600
drama. It sounds super real.

307
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:10,920
We kind of deny that the society is, is,

308
00:20:10,921 --> 00:20:14,010
seems to be speeding up
before our very eyes.

309
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,410
The whole idea of renting things,

310
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:21,300
it has to do with the people's desire
to not have a permanent commitment to

311
00:20:21,301 --> 00:20:21,930
them.

312
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:26,930
I think it's important to recognize
the depth of loneliness that,

313
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,710
uh, must be addressed to
you and I, and in the end it

314
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:31,370
doesn't resolve at all.

315
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,280
You'll just left with like 12 different
feelings that you don't even know what

316
00:20:34,281 --> 00:20:37,370
to do with. I mean, I think in a way
like that's, that's what he represents.

317
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:39,980
You're like thrown in the middle of the
action and it's gritty and you don't

318
00:20:39,981 --> 00:20:43,190
understand. It's kind of dark and
it's not all going to get resolved.

319
00:20:43,191 --> 00:20:46,850
All the answers aren't going to be given
to you and you're going to have like

320
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,340
weird feelings. You don't
know what to do with.

321
00:20:48,341 --> 00:20:51,880
And often it's going to overreach
and it's not even going to work.

322
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:56,020
But it was still kind of cool. You know,
like all of that is completely content.

323
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:59,650
It's completely seventies
film turned into radio.

324
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:03,850
So what is it that you think you took
with you from Joe Frank and put into this

325
00:21:03,851 --> 00:21:05,770
American life? I mean, there are
a couple of things. Honestly,

326
00:21:05,771 --> 00:21:08,170
the first thing is just what he
gave me the most important thing,

327
00:21:08,171 --> 00:21:10,880
which was desire to do
it. You know what I mean?

328
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:15,910
Like hearing him made me want to make
stories and then I spent over a decade

329
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:20,050
trying to figure out how to do
it with facts and with reporting.

330
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:24,610
The thing that started me with that
ambition was him. So that's one thing.

331
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:26,740
A second thing is I'm just,

332
00:21:26,741 --> 00:21:29,680
the way he would use music and the way
that the music would pull the story

333
00:21:29,681 --> 00:21:33,820
forward and create a mood, but also kind
of like push you into the dream of it.

334
00:21:33,821 --> 00:21:37,420
The notion that you'd use music
as a kind of cinematic scoring,

335
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:39,130
which is not the way, you know,

336
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:42,520
music would be used in old time radio
dramas and certainly not the way music was

337
00:21:42,521 --> 00:21:45,340
being used on anything on NPR. And, um,

338
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:49,450
the way he uses music is so built into
me that a couple of years after this

339
00:21:49,451 --> 00:21:52,660
American life was on the air, Joe
was already living out in California,

340
00:21:52,661 --> 00:21:55,540
had been for years and still
doing his show. And uh,

341
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:59,080
like mutual friends let me know
like Joe is so angry with you.

342
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,270
And I was like, why is Joe so angry
with me? You know what I mean?

343
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:06,700
Cause he was my like, he was
like, why is he so angry?

344
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:11,710
And then it turned out that Joe thought
that I was listening to his show and

345
00:22:11,711 --> 00:22:16,150
stealing the music. Oh yeah. And then
got in touch with him and he's just like,

346
00:22:16,151 --> 00:22:18,700
it's so petty. He said, this is so petty.

347
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:21,790
You could be choosing any music and
you're listening to my show. He's like,

348
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:26,710
it takes me so long to find decent music
and I edited so carefully, you know,

349
00:22:26,711 --> 00:22:29,710
it's such a part of the identity of the
show and that you just listen to my show

350
00:22:29,711 --> 00:22:33,070
and rip me off, like do a little
work brother. And I was like, Joe,

351
00:22:33,071 --> 00:22:36,190
it's so much worse than
that. Like the fact,

352
00:22:36,191 --> 00:22:39,970
it's like I haven't had your show in
years. I haven't heard it. I'm so sorry.

353
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,690
And what happened is I just
learned how to use music from you.

354
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:46,240
And so when Pat Mathenia
comes out with a new record,

355
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:49,450
I hear the same track you do and
hear the same possibility in it.

356
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:53,080
And I just do the same thing because
like it's so built into who I am.

357
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:56,890
So in a way like I am
totally stealing from you,

358
00:22:57,130 --> 00:23:01,130
but I swear I didn't know it. No.

359
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:05,080
Did you ever, did you ever like
land that in a good place with him?

360
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:07,780
He was fine at the end of it, I think.
I think it was just something about the,

361
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:11,620
it was just, it seems so like, it seems
so small to him, you know what I mean?

362
00:23:11,621 --> 00:23:13,910
Like what, you're listening to my showing,
you're stealing my music. Like what,

363
00:23:13,911 --> 00:23:18,040
what's the matter with you? You know
what I mean? Just seem cheap. Yeah.

364
00:23:18,041 --> 00:23:21,730
So there was that. And um, what
else carries forward from him?

365
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:24,040
I mean, I mean it's, it's

366
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:32,920
honestly there's a thing or two that he
does that I have never figured out how

367
00:23:32,921 --> 00:23:36,250
to imitate that in the back of my mind
I still feel like I'm going to steal

368
00:23:36,251 --> 00:23:39,040
that. And one of them is this
thing that came up last week.

369
00:23:39,041 --> 00:23:40,480
I was talking to Parker, one of the,

370
00:23:40,481 --> 00:23:44,230
like the younger producers here and she
was talking about a thing she wanted to

371
00:23:44,231 --> 00:23:47,660
do and kind of a moment she really loves
and she used to be a film professor and

372
00:23:47,661 --> 00:23:50,420
is like a super cinematic thing. She was
shooting for us. Like, you know what,

373
00:23:50,421 --> 00:23:52,700
you should really listen to this Guy
Joe Frank at, you never heard of him.

374
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:57,350
And I downloaded last week I bought
and downloaded a the 80 yard run.

375
00:23:57,351 --> 00:24:00,530
Which have you heard that one? No,
no one I haven't heard. Oh my God,

376
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:02,720
it's a super early one. In fact,

377
00:24:02,721 --> 00:24:06,170
I think it's just an air check of one
of his WBAI broadcast before he was

378
00:24:06,171 --> 00:24:09,050
national. I think it's an
actual live radio show.

379
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:13,250
I'm done late at night and it's just
him and a microphone with music.

380
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:15,980
And he's telling this story of
what he keeps referring to as,

381
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:20,110
because I like to call it my infamous
80 yard run is a rather twisted,

382
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,700
convoluted tale.

383
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,240
Now, before I get to the
full story of my ADR run,

384
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,970
I hope that you will bear with me.

385
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,520
There's a few things
you need to know first.

386
00:24:27,521 --> 00:24:29,290
And the first thing you need
to know is about this fight

387
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:33,880
between Luis Rodriguez and
Ruben, Hurricane Carter.

388
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:35,490
You know, it's, there's a lot of that.

389
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,690
And then he tells you like a series of
professional fights that happened over

390
00:24:39,691 --> 00:24:42,030
the years and tells them so well

391
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:45,210
he absorbed an awesome, terrible beating,

392
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:48,960
standing propped up unconscious.

393
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:50,590
And then there comes a
point where he's like,

394
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:53,890
you're like six or eight minutes
into the thing and he says, um,

395
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:57,010
but before I can tell you that part of
the story you need to in this next thing.

396
00:24:57,011 --> 00:24:58,090
And I will tell you that

397
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:01,820
after a brief interlude during
which I will drink some tea

398
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:06,890
[inaudible]

399
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:10,910
and they're like, what are you, like the
music comes up and then he just leaves.

400
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,200
And I was like, oh my God.

401
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,400
And like I've spent 30 years trying
to figure out how to steal that.

402
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:23,930
You want to have a team moment. I don't
even know how to do it. I honestly,

403
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,130
I honestly,

404
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,130
I don't know man. I mean, I mean like,

405
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,560
like I'm going to figure it out,

406
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:34,830
but first I'm going to
go make myself some tea.

407
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:41,440
[inaudible]

408
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,990
that's IRA glass from this
American life thanks to him.

409
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:47,860
Thanks also to brook class, tune
from on the media and to Sarah, Cari,

410
00:25:47,861 --> 00:25:51,190
and Kelly prime of the more perfect
crew who produced this tribute.

411
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:54,280
Also a very special
thanks to Michael Story.

412
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:57,280
If you want to hear excerpts
of Joe Frank's work,

413
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:58,990
which I would highly recommend,

414
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:02,850
go to Joe frank.com his
entire archive is there.

415
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:05,800
We'll also link you to it
from radiolab.org and one
of the things that you will

416
00:26:05,801 --> 00:26:10,000
hear, I think if you listen and
Ira and I talked about this,

417
00:26:10,001 --> 00:26:14,680
is that even though he's a guy who has
inspired so many of us to get into the

418
00:26:14,681 --> 00:26:18,730
business of telling stories,
nobody sounds like him still

419
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:22,710
because it's completely impossible to
imitate you into the hundreds of thousands

420
00:26:22,711 --> 00:26:26,580
of podcasts that are happening now.
There's nobody doing anything as

421
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:28,703
um,

422
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:32,100
caring and competent
at the same time. Yeah.

423
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:36,090
Like literally like it's so singular,
you can't really imitate it very well.

424
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:40,080
And I'm personally not one
who, who believes that matters.

425
00:26:40,081 --> 00:26:42,360
Like if your work lives on
past you, you know what I mean?

426
00:26:42,361 --> 00:26:44,640
Like I feel like fuck people in
the future, you know what I mean?

427
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:48,180
Like these are radio shows, you know,
like, like they meant to be enjoyed, like,

428
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:49,620
you know, like right now.

429
00:26:49,621 --> 00:26:53,130
And then like if no one ever listens to
them again after we're gone. Like, well,

430
00:26:53,131 --> 00:26:56,580
fuck them. Anyway, like walking around
and being alive while we're dead.

431
00:26:56,610 --> 00:26:57,121
First of all,

432
00:26:57,121 --> 00:27:01,740
fuck all those people being alive and
having sandwiches and meeting for lunch

433
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:06,060
while we're dead and not existing.
Like I hate them already.

434
00:27:06,061 --> 00:27:08,400
They can fuck themselves. Um,

435
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:12,510
but it seems if it seems
sad that, that, that,

436
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:17,750
that other people like won't know this
weird thing that I know is so special,

437
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:23,190
you know, like, he's so outpacing
everybody. Even now, even now,

438
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:27,090
there's like this army of people making
podcasts and trying to invent something

439
00:27:27,091 --> 00:27:29,260
that's like nobody else
is doing. He still is.

440
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:32,460
He still has outpaced every
single one of them from the grave.

441
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:37,080
That's a perfect place
to end. Okay. Bye. Bye.
