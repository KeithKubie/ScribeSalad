00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:10.840
When a movie is perfectly cast, it’s supposed
to be a good thing.

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.570
Casting agents and directors search to the
ends of the earth to find the right actor.

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.320
One that will fulfill a specific vision, and
maybe, if they’re lucky, become the icon

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.500
of a franchise.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.231
But all good things must come to an end.

00:00:23.231 --> 00:00:27.800
And sometimes the actors become so synonymous
with their roles, that it can be hard to see

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:28.800
them as anything else.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.020
Here are Screen Rant’s 10 Famous Actors
Who Can’t Escape Their Most Iconic Roles.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.320
Mark Hamill
Star Wars did amazing things for Mark Hamill’s

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.320
career.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.040
His portrayal of Luke Skywalker is beloved
by legions of people all over the world.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.240
But after 1983, the actor was getting bored.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.110
Being offered similar roles was frustrating
for the Jedi, but he soon found his footing

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.470
behind the camera.

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.059
Hamill has done a ton of voice acting since.

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:57.629
Most notably as Batman’s Joker, both on
television and in video games.

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.470
Working offscreen was a smart move, because
as soon as viewers see his face, he becomes

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:02.580
Luke Skywalker again.

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.690
He can’t have hated the character too much,
though.

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.290
Since he came back to the franchise for 2015’s
The Force Awakens.

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.930
Robert Pattinson
Robert Pattinson hated the Twilight franchise.

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.320
And says that while reading the script for
the first time, he came out of the experience

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.799
feeling pretty apathetic about the whole thing.

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.759
In interviews, he made fun of the books, the
author, and the loyal fans.

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.759
But he took the most jabs at his own character,
Edward Cullen.

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.060
Maybe he thought that if he ragged on the
material first, it wouldn’t hurt so badly

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.450
when the critics did.

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.700
Whatever the case, Pattinson has been struggling
ever since to get the sparkles off his skin.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.549
And if he can’t, the character he hates
most will become the only one people remember.

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:44.710
If it hasn’t already.

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.860
Sean Connery
For a lot of people, Sir Sean Connery was

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.350
the perfect James Bond.

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.270
And after many different versions of the character,
the original remains the favorite today.

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.289
But according to the actor himself, the love
is not mutual.

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:00.689
Connery has been vocal about the degree to
which he despises the legendary British spy.

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.259
Even though it was the start of a long-lasting
career in Hollywood, he thought the movies

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.619
quickly started to become parodies of themselves
after Dr. No.

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.619
The actor started donating his Bond paychecks
to charity.

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.700
Maybe as a way to compensate for all the negativity
he thought the movies promoted.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.940
Movies which are still beloved to this day.

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.050
Sharon Stone
People will spend unspeakable amounts of money

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:21.710
to make themselves beautiful.

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:24.540
But for Sharon Stone, her appearance was an
obstacle.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.080
The actress’ career took off after the release
of Basic Instinct in 1992.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.480
Where she played the super-sexy Catherine.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.330
But she quickly became frustrated at the roles
she was being offered after that.

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.660
Sensing that filmmakers wanted to sculpt her
into a generic sexy blonde archetype, she

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.190
started to look elsewhere.

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.610
And what she found was Martin Scorsese.

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.240
The legendary director chose Stone for the
role of Ginger in 1995’s Casino.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.340
And her career began a different trajectory.

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.290
The actress is now pretty iconic.

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.430
Too bad that wasn’t enough to save her from
Catwoman.

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.840
Thomas F. Wilson
You might not recognize his name, but you’ll

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.540
definitely recognize his face.

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.450
Thomas F. Wilson played mega-bully Biff Tannen
in Back to the Future.

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.980
The actor believes his face is so recognizable,
that he’s at the point where he carries

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.350
around flyers with answers to popular questions
he gets asked.

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.480
So when excited Biff fans approach, they leave
with a handout instead of a conversation.

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.340
After playing the same character four different
ways, it’s easy to see why the actor is

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:20.340
sick of the attention.

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.250
He probably wants to spend some time in his
own head for a change.

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.340
Which is hard to do with a pocket full of
flyers.

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.760
Hayley Joel Osment
If you’re a filmmaker looking to take your

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.480
horror film to the next level, put a child
at the center of the plot.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.320
Chances are, it will become exponentially
more terrifying.

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.700
M. Night Shyamalan knows this, and with The
Sixth Sense, he proved it.

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.820
When scary things happen to innocent kids,
it makes the audience’s experience all the

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:45.130
more gut-wrenching.

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:49.820
As Cole Sears, a young Haley Joel Osment became
the poster-child for one of the most over-quoted

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.320
lines of movie dialogue in existence.

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:55.320
(“i see dead people”) But after the film’s
success, fans had difficulty separating the

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:56.870
actor from his breakout role.

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.650
And his career lost momentum.

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.820
Elijah Wood
The Lord of the Rings series has been captivating

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.940
minds since the first book was released in
1954.

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.470
So it’s had quite some time to build a fanbase.

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.430
When adapting a book for the big screen, there’s
a high probability that most of the existing

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:13.820
fans will still prefer the book.

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:18.060
It’s an uphill battle from the get-go, but
when director Peter Jackson released his take

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:22.760
on the story in the early 2000’s, the response
was definitely positive.

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:26.699
Audiences were wowed by the stunning visuals
of the trilogy, but it’s real strength lies

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:27.699
is in the casting.

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:31.819
As a matter of fact, Elijah Wood was so perfect
for the role of Frodo Baggins that he took

00:04:31.819 --> 00:04:34.210
every far-flung role that came after it.

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:38.560
He figured that if he performed in all genres,
then he couldn't be trapped by one.

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.540
Arnold Schwarzenegger
For a lot of people on this list, their most

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:44.289
iconic role turned out to be the kiss of death.

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:45.430
And then there’s Arnold Schwarzenegger.

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.370
A man who’s not trying to shake his label
at all.

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:53.389
James Cameron cast the Austrian bodybuilder
as the Terminator in 1984, and he hasn’t

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:55.960
looked back since.

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:00.150
The actor has even reprised his role as the
T-800 in most of the movies that followed.

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:04.020
For the most part, Schwarzenegger just goes
with the badass cyborg image.

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.770
And it turns out the complaints he has about
the franchise have mostly to do with Terminator

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:10.860
Salvation, a project he was not actually a
part of.

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:14.449
John Travolta
Depending on who you ask, disco was either

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:17.300
the golden age of music, or a stain on history.

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.400
Wherever you stand on the issue, you’ll
have a hard time keeping your feet still while

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.360
watching Saturday Night Fever.

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:27.039
The 1977 ode to disco follows a young man
who can tear it up on the dance floor.

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:30.530
And with original music by The Bee-Gees, the
movie is an unforgettable one.

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:34.849
John Travolta stars as Tony, and audiences
haven’t been able to forget his moves- nor

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:37.279
do they want to.

00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:41.090
After Tony clears the other dancers off the
floor he discos his little heart out.

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:43.159
The actor has danced a lot since, too.

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:45.410
Just not on a light-up floor.

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:49.380
Daniel Radcliffe
JK Rowling has said it herself; Daniel Radcliffe

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:51.289
was the perfect Harry Potter.

00:05:51.289 --> 00:05:54.330
Thats high praise coming from the person who
created the character.

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:57.029
The boy who lived had some pretty big shoes
to fill.

00:05:57.029 --> 00:06:01.249
Holding your own in an ensemble cast made
of Dame Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, and Ralph

00:06:01.249 --> 00:06:04.110
Fiennes, is not something just any old muggle
could do.

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:08.009
Unfortunately for Radcliffe, he did a little
too well, and has had difficulty shedding

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:09.009
the label.

00:06:09.009 --> 00:06:12.699
To try and avoid being typecast, the actor
turned to plays, and landed a role that required

00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:14.029
full-frontal nudity.

00:06:14.029 --> 00:06:17.660
Which shocked a lot of people, since he was
only 17 at the time.

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:21.090
All of this could have been avoided if polyjuice
potion was real.

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:22.560
So what do you think of our list?

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.969
Did we miss any other famous actors who can’t
escape their most iconic role?
