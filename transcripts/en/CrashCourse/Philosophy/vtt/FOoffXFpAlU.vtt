00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:05.499
Is it wrong to steal to feed your family?

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.440
Is there such a thing as a good lie?

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:13.560
Questions like these are the domain of ethics – the branch of philosophy that studies morality, or right and wrong behavior.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:20.900
But before we can parse questions like these, we need to go deeper – into metaethics, which studies the very foundations of morality itself.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.620
Metaethics asks questions as basic as: what
is morality?

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:25.800
What’s its nature?

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.280
Like, is it an objective thing, out there
in the world, waiting to be known?

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:33.809
Or is it more like a preference, an opinion,
or just a bunch of cultural conventions?

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.820
There are lots of different metaethical views
out there.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:42.900
And one way to understand them is to put them to a test to see how they’d help you solve some thorny ethical problems.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.380
Like a scenario where you have to steal food
or lie for a good cause.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:52.480
Or what about this: What if you set out to harm someone, but you ended up saving their life by accident?

00:00:52.480 --> 00:01:02.880
[Theme Music]

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:09.840
Some people think that ethics is a kind of science, that it seeks to discover moral truths, whose existence is testable and provable.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.540
But others believe the nature of morality is every bit as subjective as whether you prefer plain M&amp;Ms, or peanut.

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:17.240
There’s just no right answer.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.500
Unless you have a peanut allergy.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:24.580
So, you and your friend might totally agree on whether something is immoral or not, but you might disagree fervently about why.

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:30.180
For an example of a slippery moral scenario, let’s just head straight over to the Thought Bubble for some Flash Philosophy.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:36.100
A burglar plots to break into an old woman’s house on a Sunday morning, a time when he knows she’s always at church.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.160
So one Sunday, he creeps up to her back window,
and smashes it with a hammer.

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.909
But, after he looks inside, he sees that the
old woman isn’t at church.

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:46.329
She’s in there, laying face-down on the
floor.

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:48.890
The sight of her body scares the burglar,
and he runs away.

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.300
He was down for a little bit of burglary, but getting nabbed for murder was NOT part of his plan.

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.260
But what the burglar didn’t know was that
the old woman wasn’t dead.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.800
She was unconscious, having passed out because of a carbon monoxide leak that would have killed her.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:07.100
When the burglar broke the window, he let out some of the toxic gas, and let in fresh air, which allowed her to regain consciousness.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:13.080
So, the burglar broke into the house with the intention of stealing from the woman, but, inadvertently, he saved her life.

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.310
Did the burglar do a good thing?

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.340
Does he deserve praise, even though he didn’t
intend to help the woman?

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:25.200
Likewise, does he still deserve blame, even though he didn’t actually get around to stealing anything, and ended up saving the woman’s life?

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.340
Thanks Thought Bubble!

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.820
Your answers to these questions will help you suss out where your moral sensibilities lie.

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.760
And why you answer the way you do will say a lot about what metaethical view you subscribe to.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:44.180
One of the most widely held metaethical views is known as Moral Realism, the belief that there are moral facts, in the same way that there are scientific facts.

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.240
In this view, any moral proposition can only
be true, or false.

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.550
And for a lot of us, our gut intuition tells
us that there are moral facts.

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.380
Some things are just wrong, and others are
indisputably right.

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:02.300
Like, a lot of people think that gratuitous violence is always wrong, and nurturing children is always right – no matter what.

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.310
But, you don’t have to dig very deep into
moral realism before you run into trouble.

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.630
Like for one thing, if there are moral facts,
where do they come from?

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:10.900
How do we know what they are?

00:03:10.901 --> 00:03:13.161
Are they testable, like scientific facts are?

00:03:13.161 --> 00:03:14.280
Are they falsifiable?

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:22.860
And, if morality is based on facts, then why is there so much disagreement about what’s moral and what’s not, as opposed to science, where there’s often more consensus?

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.380
This is what’s known as the grounding problem.

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:35.020
The grounding problem of ethics is the search for a foundation for our moral beliefs, something solid that would make them true in a way that is clear, objective, and unmoving.

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:41.580
If you can’t find a way to ground morality, you might be pushed toward another metaethical view: Moral Antirealism.

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:48.200
This is the belief that moral propositions don’t refer to objective features of the world at all – that there are no moral facts.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.560
So a moral anti-realist would argue that there’s nothing about gratuitous violence that’s inherently wrong.

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.800
Likewise, they’d say, if you look at the rest of the animal kingdom, sometimes nurturing your kids doesn’t seem like it’s that important.

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.010
So, maybe morality isn’t the same for everyone.

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:06.800
But still, most people you know – including yourself – are committed to some form of moral realism.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.000
And there are MANY forms.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.700
So let’s familiarize ourselves with some
of its most popular flavors.

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.640
Some moral realists are Moral Absolutists.

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:21.040
Not only do they believe in moral facts, they believe there are some moral facts that don’t change.

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:25.780
So, for them, if something is wrong, it’s
wrong regardless of culture or circumstance.

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:30.360
Moral facts apply as universally and as constantly
as gravity or the speed of light.

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.540
If moral absolutism sounds too rigid, maybe
Moral Relativism would appeal to you.

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:38.960
This view says that more than one moral position
on a given topic can be correct.

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:42.710
And one of the most common forms of moral
relativism is cultural relativism.

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:47.780
But there are actually two different things a person might mean when they talk about cultural relativism.

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.220
The more general kind is Descriptive Cultural
Relativism.

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:55.820
This is simply the belief that people’s
moral beliefs differ from culture to culture.

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:59.060
No one really disputes that – it seems obviously
true.

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:06.660
Like, some cultures believe that capital punishment is morally right, and other cultures believe it’s morally wrong – that killing another human is inherently unethical.

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:14.880
But there’s also Normative Cultural Relativism, which says that it’s not our beliefs, but moral facts themselves that differ from culture to culture.

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:21.220
So in this view, capital punishment is morally correct in some cultures and is morally wrong in others.

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:25.260
Here, it’s the moral fact of the matter
that differs, based on culture.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:29.740
Now, normative cultural relativism might sound pretty good to you; it does at first to a lot of people.

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.400
Because it seems like it’s all about inclusiveness
and tolerance.

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.140
Who am I to tell other cultures how they should
live, right?

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:37.300
But this view actually has some pretty big
flaws.

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:43.240
If every culture is the sole arbiter of what’s right for it, that means no culture can actually be wrong.

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:47.860
It means Nazi culture actually was right,
for the people living in that culture.

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:55.880
A dissenting German voice in, say, 1940, would have just been wrong, if it had claimed that Jewish people deserved to be treated the same as other Germans.

00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:03.460
And what makes things even weirder is that, if normative cultural relativism is true, then the concept of moral progress doesn’t make sense, either.

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:09.740
If what everyone is doing right now is right, relative to their own culture, then there’s never any reason to change anything.

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:17.840
Problems like these make some people take a second look at the antirealist stance, which, remember, is the view that there just aren’t any moral facts.

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:21.260
Just one flavor of moral antirealism is Moral
Subjectivism.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:28.820
This view says that moral statements can be true and false – right or wrong – but they refer only to people’s attitudes, rather than their actions.

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:34.480
By this thinking, capital punishment is neither right nor wrong, but people definitely have preferences about it.

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:40.740
And those preferences key into personal attitudes, but not into actual, objective moral facts about the world.

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:43.520
Like, some people favor capital punishment,
and think it’s just.

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.540
Others oppose it and think it’s unjust.

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:47.190
But it doesn’t go any deeper than that.

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:50.360
There are no moral facts, only moral attitudes.

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:57.240
There are other varieties of both moral realism and antirealism, but this should give you an idea of the general, metaethical lay of the land.

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:00.940
And by now, it probably seems like I’ve
given you a lot more problems than solutions.

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:05.740
So let’s talk about the moral frameworks you’ll use to navigate your way through all of these moral mazes.

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:08.150
These frameworks are known as ethical theories.

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:12.920
They’re moral foundations that help you come up with consistent answers about right and wrong conduct.

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:20.640
All ethical theories have some kind of starting assumptions, which shouldn’t be surprising, because really all of our beliefs rest on some basic, assumed beliefs.

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:27.880
For instance, natural law theory, which we’ll study soon, relies on the starting assumption that God created the universe according to a well-ordered plan.

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:35.360
While another ethical theory, known as utilitarianism, relies on the starting assumption that all beings share a common desire to seek pleasure and avoid pain.

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:42.420
The starting assumptions of a theory can lead us to other beliefs, but if you reject those initial assumptions, the rest of the theory just doesn’t follow.

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:49.440
Now, in addition to starting assumptions, ethical theories also consist of Moral Principles, which are the building blocks that make up the theories.

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:52.280
And these principles can be shared between
more than one theory.

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:57.620
For instance, many ethical theories agree on the principle that it’s wrong to cause unjustified suffering.

00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:07.140
Some ethical theories hold the principle that any unjustified killing is wrong – and that includes animals – while other theories hold the principle that it’s only wrong to unjustifiably kill humans.

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:11.240
But the thing about ethical theories is that
most people don’t identify with just one.

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:16.120
Instead, most people identify with principles from several theories that help them form their own moral views.

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:24.820
We’re going to be spending several weeks learning about these ethical theories, and you’ll probably find elements of some that you already believe, and others that you definitely disagree with.

00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:32.600
But all of this accepting and rejecting will help you develop a new way to talk about – and think about – what are, for now, your gut moral intuitions.

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:34.480
Today we talked about metaethics.

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:41.000
We discussed three forms of moral realism and we learned the difference between descriptive and normative cultural relativism.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.200
We also learned about moral subjectivism,
which is a form of moral antirealism.

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:47.900
And we introduced the concept of an ethical
theory.

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:52.760
Next time we’re going to learn about the ethical theory known as the Divine Command Theory.

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:56.340
