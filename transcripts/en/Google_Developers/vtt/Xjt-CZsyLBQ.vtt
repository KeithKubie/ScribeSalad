00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:13.400
&gt;&gt; SAUER: Hi, I'm Fred Sauer with Developer
Advocate. And I'm here today with three guys

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.410
with an idea. And they'd like to share this
idea with you and talk a little bit about

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:19.750
their application. If you guys can introduce
yourselves.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:21.619
&gt;&gt; RANGNEKAR: Hi, I'm Vikram.

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:22.789
&gt;&gt; GUANG: IÃ­m Ming.

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:23.970
&gt;&gt; KUMAR: I'm Naveen.

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.730
&gt;&gt; GUANG: And we are from Socialwok

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.309
&gt;&gt; SAUER: Can you guys maybe talk about some
of your motivations for building Socialwok?

00:00:30.309 --> 00:00:35.770
&gt;&gt; RANGNEKAR: Well, the motivation for building
Socialwok really came from the fact that we

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:42.550
spend so much time on tools like Facebook,
FriendFeed. And that concept of "passive sharing"

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.329
is really great because that helps me communicate
with my friends without really emailing anyone.

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:51.340
I barely know their emails anymore. And then
I'm back at work and, you know, I tend to

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:58.989
CC people, BCC people. And so, I've had bringing--that's
when I got kind of evolved from. We decided

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:03.540
that bringing that kind of passive sharing
model to business collaboration would reduce

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:10.079
a lot of mails that are floating around inside
the organization. And Goggle Apps seems to

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:16.350
be the best collaborative platform for businesses.
And so, we decided that it's a natural fit

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.150
to add our passive sharing model, to add social
walk directly into Goggle Apps.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:25.180
SAUER: Okay. Can you maybe talk about some
of the other enablers you mentioned, Google

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.369
Apps. What is it that allowed you to kind
of build this platform out and bring this

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:30.750
idea to fruition?

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.760
&gt;&gt; KUMAR: Well, it all starts with Google
App Engine. Basically with Google App Engine,

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.869
we don't have to think about how we're going
to scale our application. You don't have to

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:44.119
build. You don't have to own a farm of servers
in the data center. We basically just develop,

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:48.790
deploy and almost forget about it. And all
we have to do is worry about developing our

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:54.479
App the best we can and making sure that it's
working on that side. From there, you know,

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.920
we basically got--we move to the front end
which is GWT. And the cool thing about GWT

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.110
is that it's also in Java. We're using App
Engine with the Java language support. And

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.420
for us basically, we're developing now end
to end in the Java programming language. And

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.810
so, we really are more efficient, we don't
have to think about how we switch between

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:19.680
different languages. It makes it very, very
efficient for us to develop new features.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.410
And then from there, you know, we're using
the Google data APIs, which allow us to integrate

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.069
pretty deeply into Google Apps. And so the
Google data APIs basically are a great set

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:32.780
of tools that allow us to sort of fit into
Google Apps and make our application more

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.900
like a Google App.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:42.150
&gt;&gt; GUANG: And I just want to add that actually
using Google App Engine Java, using GWT, and

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:48.450
Google data APIs enable us to create a very
full blown enterprise grade, App Engine Java

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.890
application, right, with very little cost.

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.800
&gt;&gt; SAUER: Why did you choose to integrate
so tightly with Google Apps? Was it the APIs

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.489
or what else was of interest to you?

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:01.450
&gt;&gt; GUANG: I think the key point with Google
Apps is that as Vikram has mentioned, right?

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:08.440
In this wall right now we see that Google
Apps is one of the foremost growing online

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.519
call based office productivity tools, right?
A lot of people are starting to switch towards

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:15.879
that direction, right? Especially small and
medium businesses and that is what Socialwok

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:21.060
is trying to target, right? And so, we have
these people using all this online tools.

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.709
And so, we're basically the social layer on
top. And it's all powered by the clock, right?

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:31.319
From using Google tools, App Engine Java,
and GWT, the whole works. The whole stack.

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:35.170
&gt;&gt; RANGNEKAR: It just makes sense because
it's almost a no-brainer to choose Google

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.230
Apps as our distribution.

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:42.349
&gt;&gt; SAUER: Was this--is this true for Google
Wave Toolkit and App Engine? Had you started

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:45.099
with those tools from the beginning or did
you experiment in other places and changed

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:46.680
your mind later down the road?

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:53.659
&gt;&gt; KUMAR: When we started, of course, we started
playing around with standard Java, Java Enterprise

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:59.769
Stacks, Standard GWT and we basically started
developing from there. And then we saw that,

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:04.890
you know, this Google App Engine, we've heard
about it before but it was all piped on. But

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.519
then they said, "You know, we're announcing
Java language support." And so, we thought,

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:12.400
"You know, why not actually do this, you know,
let's not worry about having to find a bunch

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.959
of servers. Let's actually, you know, make
our App work on Google App Engine." And so,

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:23.830
from that discussion it's pretty easy for
us to move our App to Google App Engine. And

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.520
then with GWT, we had already started writing
an interface that was based with HTML, JavaScript.

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:35.479
We used the Dojo Toolkit initially and it
worked well. But we ran into some issues basically

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:41.159
with speed and performance or application.
And, you know, since we wanted to integrate

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:45.159
more with Google we feel that, you know, performance
is key. And so, one of the things that we

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:49.639
decide to do was look at Google Web Toolkit
because we heard great stories about how the

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:54.089
performance was very good. And so, we used
that to actually--we started to redevelop

00:04:54.089 --> 00:05:01.020
in that end. For us, it was a little awkward
at first because, you know, you're not used

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:07.939
to writing interfaces in Java, especially
web interfaces. But once we kind of got into

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:12.999
it, we were able to develop and we became
much more efficient as the process went on.

00:05:12.999 --> 00:05:15.129
RANGNEKAR: I'd like to add that the biggest
problem we've had using Dojo or any of the

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:20.219
other toolkits was browser compatibility.
And so, we spent a significant amount of time

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:26.419
trying to get it to work on other older browsers.
And so, and we decided those aren't worth

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:32.009
our time. It was a distraction and GWT just
allowed us to work on everything from an iphone

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:41.569
to IE8, to Chrome, to Safari Webkit. It was
amazing. And so, I mean we, you know, that

00:05:41.569 --> 00:05:43.180
actually saved us a ton of time.

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:49.199
&gt;&gt; SAUER: And so, that sounds pretty interesting.
What would you say is the most compelling

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:53.059
feature you were able to build up because
you were under the Web Toolkit and App Engine

00:05:53.059 --> 00:05:58.159
and didn't have to spend your time building
servers or wrangling cross browser issues.

00:05:58.159 --> 00:06:04.389
What did you use that time for and do you
have maybe a story for us?

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:07.520
&gt;&gt; GUANG: And so, I think one of the most
compelling things for us ix that you can see,

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:14.909
right? We have a whole feed phase service.
And so, you can see all these things where

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:21.909
the feeds are but the most exciting part is
we went from Web to Mobile Web, right? We

00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:29.339
have it on iphone, and the Android. And we
were able to do all of these very, very quickly

00:06:29.339 --> 00:06:33.809
with very minimal cost. I think that's a big
win for developers, right? The ability to

00:06:33.809 --> 00:06:40.249
create a web service that is highly scalable
with download and more importantly you can

00:06:40.249 --> 00:06:45.539
pop it out of platforms very quickly and deal
with all these browsing compatibility issues

00:06:45.539 --> 00:06:50.499
that what Vikram has mentioned. And so, that
is I will say one of the very important values

00:06:50.499 --> 00:06:52.189
for us using GWT.

00:06:52.189 --> 00:06:53.689
&gt;&gt; SAUER: That's very cool.

00:06:53.689 --> 00:06:58.909
&gt;&gt; RANGNEKAR: Our application of App 2, we
also have that rock solid feel of the web

00:06:58.909 --> 00:07:02.749
interface that's kind of important today that
a lot of Google applications like Reader and

00:07:02.749 --> 00:07:09.209
a few of the other ones actually, you know,
in part you feel like this is a solid product

00:07:09.209 --> 00:07:13.300
that you're dealing with, so. And so, GWT
actually brings that, your partner for that

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:14.199
level.

00:07:14.199 --> 00:07:19.029
&gt;&gt; SAUER: Would you have any advice to share
with other developers that are likely looking

00:07:19.029 --> 00:07:24.559
to build an application maybe on a similar
stack or have other ideas that they'd like

00:07:24.559 --> 00:07:26.399
to implement?

00:07:26.399 --> 00:07:31.499
&gt;&gt; GUANG: I think that most important thing
is that, you know, you should try our call.google.com,

00:07:31.499 --> 00:07:35.479
right? All the projects are there. And also
Google has been very friendly in the sense

00:07:35.479 --> 00:07:40.520
that there are IRC chats installed. And so,
at times we hooked up with some of the developers

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:46.419
from IRC channels. And so, I highly encourage
people to join some of the impromptu IRC chats

00:07:46.419 --> 00:07:50.800
that are from the App Engine team, right,
where developer members like Jason Cooper,

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:58.889
Max Ross and the other guys are on. And so,
that's a very good place. And also your Google,

00:07:58.889 --> 00:08:04.279
oh, sorry, call.google.com also has forms
where developers have posted their questions.

00:08:04.279 --> 00:08:05.360
And so, we have done that too.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:07.360
&gt;&gt; SAUER: And so, you really took advantage
of the community and were able to collaborate

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:10.879
with others?

00:08:10.879 --> 00:08:18.349
&gt;&gt; GUANG: Yeah, I think that's very important.
And I think we also looked at other implementation

00:08:18.349 --> 00:08:21.300
for other companies and we find that Google
has the most, in our view, the most developer

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:27.289
friendly, right, form of open source perspective
as well as answering questions and having

00:08:27.289 --> 00:08:30.319
a whole knowledge base for developers to look
into.

00:08:30.319 --> 00:08:34.149
&gt;&gt; RANGNEKAR: However the most important thing
is developers getting the platform is to make

00:08:34.149 --> 00:08:37.919
sure that, you know, you donÃ­t spend a
considerable amount of time just, you know,

00:08:37.919 --> 00:08:42.430
searching for answers if you know where to
find them. There should be proper documentation

00:08:42.430 --> 00:08:47.370
and most of the tools, all the tools in fact
we worked with including that of API, GWT,

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:54.350
App Engine Java was documented. And the documentation
was improving. And so, that actually helped

00:08:54.350 --> 00:09:00.250
us through. You know, we didn't have to go
and search obscure forums for information

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:02.910
because it's all in one place and that gave
us a lot of speed.

00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:05.050
&gt;&gt; KUMAR: And I guess the final piece of advice
that we give to any developer is to just dive

00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:11.959
in, you know. Google doesn't provide, doesn't,
you know, bar you from anything, you know.

00:09:11.959 --> 00:09:17.970
App Engine has free quarters that let you
get started. You can easily just write your

00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:21.310
first App, deploy it and actually just get
started. And when you--once you dive in then

00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:26.500
it becomes really easy to sort of push ahead
and actually innovate much more.

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:29.940
&gt;&gt; GUANG: Just to add to the committee angle
of what Fred mentioned, right. Also as for

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:34.959
us we are from Singapore. We actually helped
set up the Singapore GTUG, the G-Tech. And

00:09:34.959 --> 00:09:39.569
around the world there's many G-Techs, right?
And we found that when we hosted the first

00:09:39.569 --> 00:09:45.060
G-Tech for Singapore on App Engine and GWT,
we had 150 people showed up. And they gave

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:50.259
us a lot of feedback. And so, I highly encourage
developers, right, if you are in wherever

00:09:50.259 --> 00:09:55.339
you are, Moscow, Tokyo, China, I understand
that there are G-Techs in all of these place,

00:09:55.339 --> 00:09:59.810
you should go talk to other developers. And
also, more importantly, do something first

00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:02.879
and then show it to other people and get feedback.

00:10:02.879 --> 00:10:05.290
&gt;&gt; RANGNEKAR: Yes, absolutely. I think to
add to the advantages of App Engines something

00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:11.199
that just occurred to me was the fact that,
you know, this is the advice I give to a lot

00:10:11.199 --> 00:10:16.290
of developers, don't spend time being system
administrators, you know. I know it's fun

00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:22.300
to roll your own stuff but it doesn't always
work in production or you spend a lot of time

00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:26.709
doing stuff that as a developer you should
not maybe be looking at. And so, App Engine,

00:10:26.709 --> 00:10:31.850
you know, as opposed to a lot of other App
platforms lets you be a developer and not

00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:36.199
a system administrator. And so, you know,
so you can actually have a code deployed and

00:10:36.199 --> 00:10:40.230
running, you know, from the second you get
on it. And so, that's really cool.

00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:45.439
&gt;&gt; SAUER: That's great. And so, do you have
maybe any parting advice for Google? What

00:10:45.439 --> 00:10:50.350
is it that we can do to better help developers
like you and make you more productive?

00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:57.199
&gt;&gt; GUANG: I think from our perspective the
only chance we had was evolvement. It would

00:10:57.199 --> 00:11:02.040
be great if we could get more visibility from
Google regarding the features launch and also

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:03.670
I think the IRC channels are a good start
to get real live interaction but more visibility

00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:03.720
would be great.

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:05.759
&gt;&gt; SAUER: Okay. Well, thank you very much.
Thank you for coming and sharing your idea

00:11:05.759 --> 00:11:08.029
with us.

00:11:08.029 --> 00:11:10.769
&gt;&gt; RANGNEKAR: Thank you.

00:11:10.769 --> 00:11:13.129
&gt;&gt; GUANG: Thank you.

00:11:13.129 --> 00:11:14.240
&gt;&gt; SAUER: Okay.
