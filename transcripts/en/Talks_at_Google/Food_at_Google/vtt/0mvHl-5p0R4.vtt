00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:08.410
&gt;&gt;Susan: I'd like to welcome Janna Gur to
come to our Authors@Google talk and I'm personally,

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:13.929
really thrilled to have Janna Gur here since
I'm a big fan and a big supporter of her cuisine

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:19.640
and her cookbook, which I, which I own and
which I think has many incredible recipes.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:25.910
So, I was excited to have her here. And one
of the reasons I thought it was great and

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:31.600
such a good fit was because Google, as all
of you know, as foodies we have a tradition

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:38.120
at Google of having really incredible food.
And there's a lot of appreciation for good

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:47.650
food at Google. And we also have a whole group,
for example, we have Koogle at Google, which

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:54.989
is an alias that is the Google community that
celebrates Passover and gets together and

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:01.739
does a meal. But, Janna Gur has a very impressive
background, which I'd like to share.

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.990
She's the founder and editor-in-chief of the
Israeli food magazine, "Al Hashulhan," did

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:13.619
I say that right? She'll correct, she'll probably
say it correctly afterwards. She's published

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.170
28 books, and everyone should get them all.

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.189
[Susan laughs]

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:25.639
In Hebrew and in English. No, actually just
one. I, I can't read Hebrew, including her

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:32.270
first book, "The New Book of Israeli Food:
A Culinary Journey." And we have copies of

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.320
those books for sale and they're in the back,
and with that I'd like to have Janna come

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.740
up and introduce, start giving us some background
on her perspective. Thank you.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.430
[applause]

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:55.609
&gt;Janna: Hi, good afternoon. It's really exciting
and it's a great honor to be there. As a Google

00:01:55.609 --> 00:02:02.829
user, Google is part of our lives, every day,
every moment almost, we're Googling something

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:07.539
and to be actually here to speak to you and
I know there are many other people somewhere

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:12.939
in the offices, hopefully listening to me,
but we, they won't be able to have the cookies,

00:02:12.939 --> 00:02:17.450
by the way. We're gonna cookies later. Only
those who are actually here, so some people

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.840
that are hiding in the rooms, they're welcome
to join us.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:30.629
Ok, thank you, Susan, for such warm introduction.
It's, my task is for next hour to try to explain

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:36.360
to you what Israeli food really is. And its,
it's a simple question, it's tricky answer

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:43.040
because it's food and cuisine in the making,
changing all the time, really finding it itself

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.760
all the time and since we're foodies here,
I hope, mostly the people who are listening

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:55.640
in, I decided to do it not through history,
not through long and theoretical discourse,

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:01.340
but through 12 dishes and ingredients. So,
it's gonna be the story of Israeli food in

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:02.340
12 dishes.

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:14.360
And the first one, sorry, I have to, wait
a second. I forgot that I'm not, read my password

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:22.260
again. Password, of course, taking up valuable
Google time.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:38.040
Visitor's effect is what it's called, of course.
Of course another glitch.

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.040
Ok.

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.040
Ok.

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.810
Thank God, could be really embarrassing.

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:43.810
[Janna laughs]

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:50.989
Ok, so here we have our first, the first thing
you actually think about when you say "Israeli

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:57.280
food," you think about falafel. So, I have
it here, proudly on the screen, but it's not

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.579
gonna be part of our Israeli dozen for a simple
reason because everybody more or less knows

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:07.120
what it is. "Oh, you're going to Israel, you're
gonna have a lot of falafel." So, sure there

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:12.000
is falafel. It's a very popular street snack
in Israel, but I think it's about time we

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:19.140
learned about other things which are Israeli
food and let's move to our next member of

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:22.030
the family, actually the first one.

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:29.200
And it's much, much less known. And it's very,
very ancient. And actually, I'd like to start

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.601
here because it takes us all the way back
to the Biblical times. And, you know, Israel

00:04:33.601 --> 00:04:39.260
is a very young country, 62 years old and,
but we do have very ancient history it goes

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:46.310
all the way, thousands years ago. And this
product is, has actually very fascinating

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:54.580
story. It's called "freeki" in Arabic, modern
day Arabic, but it also appears in the Bible.

00:04:54.580 --> 00:05:01.040
If you are familiar with celebrating the holiday
of Shavu'ot, the Holiday of Weeks, in three

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:08.870
weeks, and there is a very famous love story
between Boaz and Ruth. This poor widow from,

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:14.860
from Moab, and wealthy, older man and they
fall in love and they get married and they

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.540
become great-grandparents of King David.

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:23.630
And they're seduction scene is actually a
picnic; he's feeding her and he's feeding

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:29.370
her, in Hebrew, we say "savatla mea kehli",
any Israeli's here in the audience? Ok, you

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:35.060
remember it's "savatla mea kehli"? Pinched
her from the kehli. Kehli, in modern day Hebrew

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:42.320
means "a toast," but obviously Boaz didn't
have a toaster in the field, so it should

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:46.140
be something else. It should've been something
else, it's something that we, we call in Hebrew

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:55.590
also "karrmel" and it means green, cracked,
toasted wheat. Ok? So, why green toasted wheat?

00:05:55.590 --> 00:06:02.810
Because, in the ancient times, we have this
very, very extreme heat waves in Israel during

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:09.590
springtime and the farmers were afraid that
the harvest will be ruined, will burn out.

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:16.560
So, they harvested some of the wheat early,
toasted it so it wouldn't spoil, cracked it,

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:22.090
and used it for cooking, toasted it. So, it's
a little bit like bulgur wheat, but it's green

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:28.340
wheat. And it's extremely, extremely, flavorful.
It has some very interesting smoky flavor.

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:33.520
It's popular in Arabic and Jewish cuisine.
Actually, it's a very ancient product that

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:39.580
survived thousands of years and remained in
Arabic cuisine. And Israeli chefs just fell

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:45.460
in love with it lately and it became one of
the trendiest dishes on Israeli restaurant

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:50.651
menus. So, this shows the continuation of
tradition from the Bible all the way to the

00:06:50.651 --> 00:06:56.010
modern age and here, I think, we have --

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:57.230
[pause]

00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:08.250
Ok, here we go. This is actually Boaz and
Ruth in the garden. And this is freeki pilaf,

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:13.940
made from one of our later, latest Israeli
cookbooks, very flavorful. I think you can

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:19.220
get it in the States as well, it's called
Green Wheat and this is the first member of

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:22.560
my Israeli dozen. And let's move on to the
next one.

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:31.000
We're still in the Biblical times, and any
ideas what is this beautiful fruit or vegetable,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:37.440
anybody? Dates. That's right. Usually, I hope
people will say "olives" or "grapes," but

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:43.710
these are dates. Dates are one of the symbols
of ancient Israel. They are a member of the

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:48.740
seven species; the seven fruits and vegetables
with which the land of Israel is blessed.

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:55.230
You all know the expression, "the land of
milk and honey." Ok, now, the theory is that

00:07:55.230 --> 00:08:00.990
the honey in the milk and honey is not bee's
honey, but date honey.

00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:07.250
Date molasses, actually, and it's, it was
a very important sweetener in the ancient

00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:13.330
times. Israel was covered with date growths
that looked something like that. Ok, this

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:17.860
is the harvest. The same dates we've just
seen, the red ones, that's the way they look

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:23.050
on the tree. So, as I was saying, the date
honey, the honey in the land of milk and honey,

00:08:23.050 --> 00:08:28.280
is actually date honey, and that's what it
looks like. You can see it's brown, it's sweet,

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:35.620
it's less sweet than actual honey and it's
sort of caramel flavored. And, again, it comes

00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:40.780
originally from Iraq, from Iraqi Jews were
the ones who brought it to Israel because

00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:45.510
you all know that Israel is actually immigrant
societies, with people coming from all over

00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:48.450
the world, each one bringing their own food
traditions.

00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:53.950
So, the date honey, or as we call it in Hebrew,
"silan," actually arrived with Iraqi Jews

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:59.540
and today, well, you know bee producers, honey
producers in Israel really have a problem

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:05.950
because silan is winning, becoming more popular
than actual honey. It's cheaper to produce,

00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:11.580
it's less sweet, it's, and it's very, very
trendy. So, I think in the States you can

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:16.830
find it maybe in Middle Eastern shops or in
stores that carry Israeli produce. You should

00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:21.371
try it, it's great for glazing. It's actually
a little bit thinner, a little bit less sweet,

00:09:21.371 --> 00:09:28.330
but it goes, again, all the way back to Biblical
tradition and yet another ingredient that

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:32.780
comprises what we now call Israeli cuisine.

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:34.140
[pause]

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:40.230
Ok. And now we come to something that everybody
knows. I mean, guess, anybody who doesn't

00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:45.060
know what it is? Here?

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:51.050
This is, of course, hummus. And hummus is
something, oh my God.

00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:52.940
[Janna laughs]

00:09:52.940 --> 00:10:02.460
Ok. Hummus. Now, hummus is basically very,
very simple dish. It's chick peas, soaked

00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:10.750
and cooked, tahini, lemon juice, water, condiments.
It's popular all over the Middle East. Everybody

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:16.300
has hummus for breakfast, maybe as a part
of mesa plate, but in Israel, hummus is actually,

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:21.810
I think I would call it a religion. Definitely
cult food. People rarely make it at home.

00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:27.000
They usually go out to a restaurant. This
one is, for example, from a place called Hummus

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:34.761
Said in Akko, one of the most famous hummus
places in Israel. And it's very male thing,

00:10:34.761 --> 00:10:40.770
you don't use knife and fork, you use, you
know, piece of very light, fluffy pita and

00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:41.770
you mop it up.

00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:47.940
And if you had real hummus, freshly made that
didn't spend any time in the refrigerator,

00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:53.860
you will know it's an amazing, amazing dish.
Otherwise, I know many Jewish people in the

00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:59.160
United States, know it as something you serve
at the bar mitzvah, and it's, it's, I mean,

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:04.410
really nothing impressive. This is not real
hummus. Real hummus you make and you serve

00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:11.270
at once. It has to be warm because, you know
hummus in Hebrew is "himtza." Vinegar in Hebrew

00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:17.240
is "hometz." It's the same root and this is
not accidental. Hummus spoils very, very quickly,

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:23.110
so to make industrial hummus, which what most
people in the States know as hummus, you have

00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:30.090
to stuff it with antioxidants, add citric
acids, all kinds of stuff that spoils the

00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:31.090
flavor.

00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:34.730
It's actually very easy to make hummus at
home. The recipes in my book, but you can

00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:40.900
find it anywhere and the secret is make it
and serve it. There is no other way and when

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:48.670
it's good, it's really, really amazing; fluffy,
flavorful, and actually there was a research

00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:54.440
conducted lately that proves that eating hummus
actually releases endorphin in your mind.

00:11:54.440 --> 00:12:00.190
So, it's the ultimate make good, make feel
well food. So, let's see if I'll be able to

00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:08.330
move safely to the next step. Ok, here we
have two other famous hummus temples, I would

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:09.330
say.

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:14.371
The bottom one is Ali Karavan, the most famous
hummus in Tel Aviv, or actually in Jaffa.

00:12:14.371 --> 00:12:20.610
By the way, invariably, best hummus places
in Israel are owned by Arabs and this is no

00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:25.950
exception. Ali Karavan in Jaffa, it's very
rare, actually, to be able to grab a table

00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:33.590
in Ali Karavan. Usually have your hummus standing
up on the pavement and balancing the plate

00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:41.400
and the pita and a few months ago I brought
a bunch of really cool, important American

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:47.570
food writers to Israel on a culinary trip.
And my fantasy was to take all these sophisticated

00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:53.900
New Yorkers to Ali Karavan and have them eating
hummus standing up and they did. And one of

00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:57.380
them said, after the taste of the hummus,
he said, well actually, "masabacha," which

00:12:57.380 --> 00:13:02.839
is a variation of hummus warm chick peas with
tahini and condiments that is really out of

00:13:02.839 --> 00:13:07.930
this world, he tasted it and said, "Ok, and
now what I'm going to do for the rest of my

00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:10.730
life?" And that was so, so great.

00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:11.730
[laughter]

00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:16.960
So, this is hummus and as I said, another
component, another cul-, much more falafel,

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:21.420
by the way. Falafel is sort of a little bit
thing of the past. We so still have falafel

00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:28.140
joints, but they are dying out and hummus
is stronger than ever. About a year or two

00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:34.120
ago, I think you might remember, Sharon, we
had this very short lived fashion of fancy

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:39.890
hummus with all kinds of creative toppings,
like bolognese on top of hummus, mushroom

00:13:39.890 --> 00:13:43.270
ragu, it went away, thankfully very quickly,
because--

00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:44.310
[laughter]

00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:49.020
you don't fool with hummus. And one last thing
before I move to the-, to the new, to the

00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:55.339
next item, my, actually during my first book
tour, a couple of years ago, I arrived in

00:13:55.339 --> 00:13:59.920
Israel, to the States, and I had whole bunch
of things that I wanted to talk about, but

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:04.800
everybody wanted to talk to me about hummus.
And I couldn't figure out why until I realized

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:07.620
that there was this movie, "Don't Fool with--

00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:09.050
&gt;&gt;memberfemale: Zohan

00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:15.870
&gt;&gt;Janna: Zohan, right. So, everybody wanted
to know all about hummus and well, but hummus

00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:20.290
outlives even trends like Zohan.

00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:25.330
Ok, and now we have something else stuffed
in the pita. Now, you must understand in,

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:30.960
in Israeli food culture, pita is not just
a pocket bread. It's a way of eating; it's

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:35.330
a way of life. You stuff anything into a pita.
You can stuff the whole lunch into a pita.

00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:40.980
You can stuff schnitzel, french fries, salad,
it goes all in a pita and it's actually sort

00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:46.870
of movable, a movable lunch, moveable table.
But what we have here in the pita is actually

00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:54.670
quite interesting and unique. And it shows
for me yet another aspect of, of Israeli food

00:14:54.670 --> 00:15:00.370
culture. It is called "sabih." Anybody familiar,
except the Israelis here in the audience.

00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:03.610
Anybody familiar here with the word sabih?
Do you know what it is?

00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:04.880
&gt;&gt;membermale: [inaudible]

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:10.930
&gt;&gt;Janna: Oh, ok. Good. But you know what it
comes from? What is the history? Now, this

00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:17.020
is really interesting. Sabih means "morning"
in Arabic. Sabah al khair, sabih is morning.

00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:25.779
Now, it's actually combination of fried eggplants,
hard boiled eggs, hummus, which we already

00:15:25.779 --> 00:15:32.529
know, and amba, a very spicy condiment coming
from Iraq and made from unripe mango. This

00:15:32.529 --> 00:15:40.480
combination, this very delicious combo-, combination,
sandwich combo, actually originates as an

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:46.640
Iraqi Jews Shabbat breakfast. Now this needs
some explanation, I guess.

00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:47.640
[laughter]

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:52.209
I guess you know that according to Israeli
religion and Judaism, you're not supposed

00:15:52.209 --> 00:15:57.740
to do any work on Saturday. Everything has
to be done in advance. You cannot light fire;

00:15:57.740 --> 00:16:03.360
you cannot do any manual work. On the other
hand, weekend is the time when you're supposed

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:09.580
to have your best meals. So, to solve this
problem, we have a lot of dishes designed

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:14.959
to be prepared in advance and enjoyed during
the Shabbat. We have very, very famous cholents,

00:16:14.959 --> 00:16:21.180
you've all heard about; the Jewish Shabbat
casserole that stays all night in the oven

00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:26.470
and then fills the house with all this hearty
smells and after you eat some, you can only

00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:31.121
go to sleep, it's so filling and so heavy.
And that's actually a good idea because it

00:16:31.121 --> 00:16:34.280
leaves nothing much to do on, on Shabbat afternoon
anyway.

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:35.529
[laughter]

00:16:35.529 --> 00:16:41.830
You cannot go to movies, I mean, you know,
the observant Jews and the other thing is

00:16:41.830 --> 00:16:46.411
breakfasts. Breakfasts are usually cold food
prepared in advance and thing that are, that

00:16:46.411 --> 00:16:52.230
can be enjoyed cold. Now, Iraqi Jews would
have this spread grilled eggplants, hard boiled

00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:58.330
eggs, hummus, and condiments on the table
and they would make their own pita with that.

00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:03.741
One gentleman from Giv'atayim, a small town
near Tel Aviv, turned this sandwich combo

00:17:03.741 --> 00:17:10.809
into an economic empire. He became very rich
sending this sabih thing and today can go

00:17:10.809 --> 00:17:17.970
into a trendy restaurant and all-, order a
sabih and a focaccia. But the origin is Jewish

00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:23.179
ethnic tradition; Jewish ethnic food from
Iraq. And this actually teaches us two things

00:17:23.179 --> 00:17:31.369
about Israeli food. One, that it draws its
inspiration from Jewish ethnic cooking and

00:17:31.369 --> 00:17:36.539
number two, Jewish ethnic cooking is much,
much more than what we know, especially in

00:17:36.539 --> 00:17:38.119
the States as Jewish ethnic cooking.

00:17:38.119 --> 00:17:44.869
It's not just gefilte fish, chopped liver,
chicken soup, etc., it's mostly food that

00:17:44.869 --> 00:17:49.710
comes from all over the world because Jews
lived all over the world, in Iraq, in Iran,

00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:56.840
in, in Morocco, in Persia, in Syria, in Hungary,
in everywhere they lived, they created some

00:17:56.840 --> 00:18:02.500
sort of ethnic cuisine that all, at some point,
arrived in Israel. So, we sort of pick and

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:08.659
choose interesting traditions from various,
various places. I have another example here.

00:18:08.659 --> 00:18:13.869
I-, by the way, this is interpretation by
a very famous Israeli chef, Yaron Shalev;

00:18:13.869 --> 00:18:18.360
it's also called a sabih. I guess it has some
eggplants, even though we cannot see them,

00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:25.590
it also has seafood and stuff. He calls it
sabih. It doesn't look like one, but it's

00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:33.730
very good, actually. And here is another example,
very quick example of breakfast food of traditional

00:18:33.730 --> 00:18:39.350
breakfast food. The Israelis, do you know
what it is? Jachnun. It comes from Yemen,

00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:46.909
another place where Jews lived for thousands
of years and it's actually, its dough rolled

00:18:46.909 --> 00:18:47.989
with fat.

00:18:47.989 --> 00:18:54.250
And I know it sounds sort of disgusting, no
it doesn't, you like the idea, but think about

00:18:54.250 --> 00:18:59.619
the croissant. What croissant dough, if you
know it? It's, it's, you flat out, you roll

00:18:59.619 --> 00:19:04.549
out pastry and put a lot of butter inside
and then you roll it again and then you spread

00:19:04.549 --> 00:19:10.389
it, so I can call it "Yemenite croissant."
And you can have it with also hardboiled egg,

00:19:10.389 --> 00:19:16.960
something you could make in advance and grated
tomatoes. So, this is another example of breakfast

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:21.119
food that turned all Israeli favorite.

00:19:21.119 --> 00:19:29.820
And now we're moving on to the next interesting
ingredient that is maybe one single most important

00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:36.999
ingredient in modern Israeli cuisine, and
this is, of course, tahini. I have it here.

00:19:36.999 --> 00:19:42.309
And it's made from sesame. One hundred percent
ground sesame; nothing else. Nothing else

00:19:42.309 --> 00:19:49.440
should be there. Now, in Israel, we use it
for salads, for cooking, for dressing, for,

00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:55.730
even for pastry. In the States, I think it's
largely misunderstood and used usually only

00:19:55.730 --> 00:20:02.010
for hummus. I have to convince people to actually
make some use of it. In the end, if we have

00:20:02.010 --> 00:20:06.100
time, we're gonna have a little demo on how
tahini spread is made. It's something that

00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:10.730
you shouldn't buy readymade. You should make
it yourself from raw material. It's very,

00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:17.109
very simple. It's 100% cholesterol free, it's
extremely versatile and we have here tahini

00:20:17.109 --> 00:20:22.549
cookies, by the way. They taste magnificent
and those who stay till the end will have

00:20:22.549 --> 00:20:23.720
a cookie, ok?

00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:24.720
[laughter]

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:31.899
But I want to show you fifth, a few things
you can make with tahini. For example, these

00:20:31.899 --> 00:20:37.410
are lamb patties with tahini dressed-, tahini
sauce. It's based on an Arabic dish called

00:20:37.410 --> 00:20:43.769
"simia." In Arabic cuisine, tahini is often
used for cooking and for baking. It doesn't

00:20:43.769 --> 00:20:49.220
break, it stays, it sort of hardens a little
bit and it gives very interesting flavor to

00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:59.739
the food. This is fish filet with raw tahini
sauce. When I say raw, I mean tahini the way

00:20:59.739 --> 00:21:02.169
it is, you can't really see, but it's like
brownish paste. When you use it with water,

00:21:02.169 --> 00:21:07.100
mix it with water, you change the consistency,
we will see it in a few minutes. And what

00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:18.519
else do we have with tahini? Ok, sorry, the
one you saw before, I want to go back to that.

00:21:18.519 --> 00:21:23.770
It's really cool. No, please, back. Back.
Ok, this is tahini ice cream, ok? Now, it

00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:31.090
sounds sort of strange, but do you know what
is halva? Ok, many people like halva. You

00:21:31.090 --> 00:21:37.529
know that halva is sweetened tahini. It's
the same thing, but with added sugar or honey.

00:21:37.529 --> 00:21:43.110
Now halva ice cream sounds great. So, this
is actually the same idea and what you have

00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:50.619
on top, this little hairs, are shredded halva.
Amazingly sweet and fluffy, it's like eating

00:21:50.619 --> 00:21:56.659
sweet clouds. It's really great. So, tahini
again, it's Middle Eastern staple, it used

00:21:56.659 --> 00:22:03.149
everywhere in Middle Eastern cooking. Israeli
chefs adopted it. They use it in very creative

00:22:03.149 --> 00:22:09.110
ways. We make all kind of flavored dressings
with that and you should learn how to use

00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:16.249
it. It's wonderful substitute for mayonnaise;
100%cholesterol free, very healthy, very calorie

00:22:16.249 --> 00:22:19.539
dense, but good calories.

00:22:19.539 --> 00:22:27.059
Ok, and now we come to the next symbol of
Israeli cooking and that's the Israeli salad.

00:22:27.059 --> 00:22:33.820
Now, again, we did not invent it. Israeli
salad is something that is actually chopped

00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:39.590
salad, cucumbers, tomatoes, onions, sometimes
peppers, sometimes mint or cilantro, olive

00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:45.249
oil, lemon juice, maybe radishes, but this
is actually the basic thing. It has to be

00:22:45.249 --> 00:22:52.309
cut before you serve it. You don't make it
in advance because the tomatoes go all mushy.

00:22:52.309 --> 00:22:58.019
Now, similar salads are found throughout the
Middle East, but I think Israel, I'm quite

00:22:58.019 --> 00:23:05.039
sure that Israel is the only country in the
world where you eat salad for breakfast. Actually,

00:23:05.039 --> 00:23:08.760
we eat it three times a day, for breakfast,
for lunch and for dinner. We sometimes stuff

00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:14.629
it in a pita and we sometimes serve it with
tahini dressing. It's actually quite delicious.

00:23:14.629 --> 00:23:21.250
And, as I said, Israeli, Israeli salad is
part of the Israeli breakfast and what sets

00:23:21.250 --> 00:23:27.690
apart Israeli breakfast from all other breakfasts
is the fact that we eat salad. And it originated,

00:23:27.690 --> 00:23:33.279
actually this tradition of having salad for
breakfast originated on a kibbutz; this, you

00:23:33.279 --> 00:23:40.340
know, Utopian agriculture commune where everybody,
there was very much part of early Israeli

00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:42.029
history.

00:23:42.029 --> 00:23:47.299
And on a kibbutz, the farmers, the workers,
would go into the fields very, very early,

00:23:47.299 --> 00:23:51.200
you know all, you all know what a kibbutz
is, of course, so I don't have to explain.

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:55.130
Ok, they would go to work very early, like
at 4 o'clock in the morning because it's a

00:23:55.130 --> 00:24:01.639
very, very hot country and they would come
back around 8 o'clock when it's already quite

00:24:01.639 --> 00:24:07.499
hungry because you put up, you know, three,
four hours of very hard manual work. And actually,

00:24:07.499 --> 00:24:14.769
your breakfast would be almost your lunch.
So, they made, they ate whatever was available

00:24:14.769 --> 00:24:17.320
and what was available was fresh vegetables,
of course.

00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:22.989
They would, actually, the kibbutzni would
cut up their veggies by themselves and have

00:24:22.989 --> 00:24:29.649
some simple dairy products, maybe some bread,
maybe some oranges, but Israeli salad was

00:24:29.649 --> 00:24:35.269
there, in the middle, in the center. And today,
I don't think you can have an Israeli breakfast

00:24:35.269 --> 00:24:42.309
without a salad. And I have here some nice
examples. This is a variation using very,

00:24:42.309 --> 00:24:44.070
various kinds of tomatoes.

00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:48.619
We have great tomatoes in Israel. I don't
know if you know that. I didn't know that,

00:24:48.619 --> 00:24:55.330
but it turns out that Israel invented cherry
tomatoes, which I think quite important thing.

00:24:55.330 --> 00:24:59.539
After ICQ, I guess.

00:24:59.539 --> 00:25:05.509
And this is an example of a restaurant version
of an Israeli breakfast. You see some fancy

00:25:05.509 --> 00:25:12.179
croissant at the background, even some sausage
and cheese and soft-boiled eggs and the salad,

00:25:12.179 --> 00:25:14.580
right there. Very nice version of Israeli
salad.

00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:20.049
If you go to Tel Aviv today, actually some
of the nicest meals you have, you can have

00:25:20.049 --> 00:25:25.679
in Israel, in general, is breakfast. It's
very many leading restaurants serve breakfasts

00:25:25.679 --> 00:25:30.600
and they make it, turned it into a really
delicious and elaborate meals. Very cheap,

00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:34.509
by the way, and they sometimes serve it throughout
the day. They just call it breakfast, but

00:25:34.509 --> 00:25:40.840
you can have it in the afternoon, also. And
there will be a salad.

00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:48.610
Ok, and now I mentioned the fact that Israeli
salad was not invented in Israel. This little

00:25:48.610 --> 00:25:54.570
fellow was, actually, I can show you the way
it looks. I mean, this is the raw material

00:25:54.570 --> 00:26:01.020
and this is probably one of the only ingredients
that were actually invented, food ingredients

00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:07.940
I mean, actually invented in Israel. And it's
known in the States as the Israeli couscous.

00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:13.509
It's not couscous. We, in Israel, call it
"ptitim." Ptitim means "little flakes" and

00:26:13.509 --> 00:26:16.460
it's actually toasted pasta flakes.

00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:20.580
And to tell you the story about them, I have
to take you to another interesting period

00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:27.269
of Israeli history. We're talking about early
50s, right after the State of Israel was founded

00:26:27.269 --> 00:26:32.590
and there were huge, huge waves of immigrations,
like four, five times larger than the original

00:26:32.590 --> 00:26:37.090
population of the country and the result was
that there was shortage in everything. And

00:26:37.090 --> 00:26:39.090
food was rationed for awhile.

00:26:39.090 --> 00:26:46.960
It became known as the Age of Austerity, or
"Tkufat HaTsena" in Hebrew, and there were

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:51.649
not enough meat, not enough fish, not enough
dairy products, and, of course, not enough

00:26:51.649 --> 00:26:58.390
rice. And the story, the legend is that Ben-Gurion
himself, the Prime Minister of the State of

00:26:58.390 --> 00:27:04.979
Israel, the first Prime Minister, came up
with an idea to produce pasta flakes that

00:27:04.979 --> 00:27:11.259
would resemble rice. And that's why the first
version of ptitm was called Ben-Gurion rice.

00:27:11.259 --> 00:27:17.320
Now, but it was not only rice shaped, it could
be couscous shape, or ball shape, like these

00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:23.909
guys. And at some point, in the 90s, in Israel
you must understand, ptitim is something kids

00:27:23.909 --> 00:27:29.289
love. It's a hit of the kindergarten lunch
menu, right? With a little bit of ketchup

00:27:29.289 --> 00:27:38.580
on top. And in the 90s, suddenly Israelis
discovered to their very great surprise that

00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:47.960
these ptitim have become the most trendy ingredient
in New York restaurants. So how did this happen?

00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:55.220
It was reborn as Israeli couscous. I think
I found the answer. We sort of conducted a

00:27:55.220 --> 00:28:01.389
little research on this subject a couple of
years ago and I believe I found the connection

00:28:01.389 --> 00:28:08.279
how this came about. An Israeli chef, whose
name is Mika Sharon, you may know her, worked

00:28:08.279 --> 00:28:14.929
in New York with a very famous chef, Don Pintabona,
it's either Tribeca Grill or Gramercy Tavern--

00:28:14.929 --> 00:28:15.999
&gt;&gt;memberfemale: Tribeca Grill

00:28:15.999 --> 00:28:19.940
&gt;&gt;Janna: Tribeca Grill. And they were friends,
actually. And he was having dinner at her

00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:27.889
home on Friday night and she just made, you
know, a pot of ptitim for her kids. She wouldn't

00:28:27.889 --> 00:28:32.489
even dream of serving it to, you know, this
important chef. He tasted it, he loved it,

00:28:32.489 --> 00:28:37.570
he took away a package that looked exactly
like that to the restaurant and the next day

00:28:37.570 --> 00:28:43.039
when she came to work, she realized that there
on the lunch special, made in some sort of

00:28:43.039 --> 00:28:48.720
fancy risotto and called Israeli couscous
because on the package it says, "Toasted Pasta

00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:54.139
Flakes, Israeli Pasta Flakes, Toasted, Israeli
Couscous," or something.

00:28:54.139 --> 00:28:59.210
So he just showed them that and turned it
into Israeli couscous and this is, according

00:28:59.210 --> 00:29:05.259
to my research at least, how the whole Israeli
couscous craze starts. Now, it finally becomes

00:29:05.259 --> 00:29:09.769
fashionable in Israel as well. We say, "Ok,
if Americans like it so much, we probably

00:29:09.769 --> 00:29:11.440
should have taken another look at that."

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:13.490
[laughter]

00:29:13.490 --> 00:29:19.059
And, for example, this is, this was our cover
photo last summer. We did a big project on

00:29:19.059 --> 00:29:27.820
ptitim and it's actually ptitim salad, Israeli
couscous salad and by the way, I had a meal

00:29:27.820 --> 00:29:32.250
in Philadelphia in a very fancy restaurant
the other day and they were serving ptitim

00:29:32.250 --> 00:29:39.479
for lunch as well, so I was very proud. Ok,
and now we come to something really, really

00:29:39.479 --> 00:29:44.599
important. Before I settle on the name for
my book, the book of new Israeli food, I was

00:29:44.599 --> 00:29:50.640
sort of trying out all kind of interesting
names for the book, and one of them was, "His

00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:52.749
Majesty, the Eggplant and Other Vegetables."

00:29:52.749 --> 00:29:53.749
[laughter]

00:29:53.749 --> 00:30:03.299
Because this is the king of Israeli vegetables,
by far the most important one and what's nice

00:30:03.299 --> 00:30:08.669
about eggplant is that it's so versatile.
It also has a chapter in this Austerity Age

00:30:08.669 --> 00:30:12.809
that I was just telling you about, because
there were plenty of eggplants. And because

00:30:12.809 --> 00:30:17.509
it's so versatile, and because it's so neutral,
you can do almost anything with it. So, we

00:30:17.509 --> 00:30:24.749
had, like, faked chopped liver made from,
from eggplants. Later on, all the rage were

00:30:24.749 --> 00:30:29.600
fried eggplants in especially Middle Eastern
restaurants, sometimes with tahini or with

00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:37.489
yoghurt, but the current and most contemporary
and in my opinion, the best way to cook eggplants

00:30:37.489 --> 00:30:42.310
is to burn them, or flame roast them. This
is the way to do it.

00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:47.980
I remember one of my New York lectures, I
so convince somebody to do it that she tried

00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:53.570
to make it in her New York kitchen and the
firemen came because they, all smoke detectors

00:30:53.570 --> 00:31:00.149
were, were, buzzing, but if you have a barbeque
or if you have, if you open a window, it's

00:31:00.149 --> 00:31:05.059
completely safe. You just put it on a stove,
it doesn't have to burn like that, but you

00:31:05.059 --> 00:31:11.499
do flame roast it until the skin is charred
and soft and then you scoop out the flesh

00:31:11.499 --> 00:31:18.529
and it has this wonderful, smoky, delicate
flavor that cannot be achieved if you make

00:31:18.529 --> 00:31:21.899
it in the oven. Sorry, it has to be open fire.

00:31:21.899 --> 00:31:28.080
Once you have this charred or burned or flame
roasted eggplant, you can do all bunch of

00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:33.830
things with it. For example, you can make
the classic baba ganoush, which is flame roasted

00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:41.690
eggplant with tahini. Or, if you are a trendy
Israeli chef, you will do something like that.

00:31:41.690 --> 00:31:48.690
Ok, this is, I call it "baba ganoush deconstructed."
You take the whole eggplant and you slit it

00:31:48.690 --> 00:31:53.619
open and instead of making a salad, you just
pour the ingredients on top of the vegetable.

00:31:53.619 --> 00:32:00.679
Here you have silan, remember I mentioned
silan, some olive oil, some tomatoes seeds,

00:32:00.679 --> 00:32:05.299
maybe some herbs, but actually it can be anything.
You can put yoghurt on top.

00:32:05.299 --> 00:32:09.850
This is a very fancy and elegant way to serve
eggplants in your home, for example, when

00:32:09.850 --> 00:32:15.789
you're entertain-, entertaining, you can make
like eggplant per person, slit it open, and

00:32:15.789 --> 00:32:18.961
you can either put the ingredients on top
and serve them in the middle of the table

00:32:18.961 --> 00:32:24.389
and everybody will eat their entrees, so to
speak, only make sure you don't eat the skin

00:32:24.389 --> 00:32:30.590
because the skin is charred and not very tasty.
Or, you can remove the skin and just leave

00:32:30.590 --> 00:32:37.380
the eggplant and then it could be something,
for example, like this. This dish is from

00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:42.639
a very nice restaurant in Tel Aviv called
Sheila, and it's like quintessentially new

00:32:42.639 --> 00:32:46.200
Israeli cuisine, you have, you can see the
eggplant on the bottom.

00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:51.639
Ok, it's without the skin so it looks sort
of beige colored. On top you see the Israeli

00:32:51.639 --> 00:32:58.960
salad mixed with raw fish, like sashimi style
raw fish, very sort of nouveau Israeli style

00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:05.169
of serving fish. And at the background, the
grayish sauce is actually tahini based, so

00:33:05.169 --> 00:33:11.960
you have like, the whole speil of Israeli
cuisine in one little, pretty dish.

00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:17.279
Ok, and we're moving to the next trendy item.
Somebody goes, "Yeah," do you know what it

00:33:17.279 --> 00:33:20.179
is?
You're just hungry, I think. You didn't have

00:33:20.179 --> 00:33:21.179
lunch.

00:33:21.179 --> 00:33:22.179
[Janna laughs]

00:33:22.179 --> 00:33:28.850
Ok, this is shakshouka. Shakshouka, now shakshouka
actually is another example of Jewish ethnic

00:33:28.850 --> 00:33:34.359
dish that became first very famous in Israel
and then sort of took even the world tour.

00:33:34.359 --> 00:33:40.200
It comes originally from Tunisia. As I mentioned,
the Jewish traditions from all over the place.

00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:46.969
Actually, it's very, I think the next photo
may be more telling. Now this is really another

00:33:46.969 --> 00:33:52.929
kind of, shakshouka, wait a second.

00:33:52.929 --> 00:33:58.169
Ok, so what you do basically, to make shakshouka,
you prepare a very, very spicy tomato sauce

00:33:58.169 --> 00:34:05.370
with peppers, with baharat, which is a typical
Middle Eastern spice mix, sometimes you can

00:34:05.370 --> 00:34:11.629
add eggplants, you can add sausage, whatever
you like. Once the sauce is cooked and spicy

00:34:11.629 --> 00:34:16.329
and flavorful, you break some eggs on top
and you wait until they are set. You can wait

00:34:16.329 --> 00:34:21.359
for three minutes, for five minutes, depending
on how you like your eggs. That's it.

00:34:21.359 --> 00:34:28.329
And there was this guy named Bino Sadok, who
created a place called Dr. Shakshuka in Jaffa,

00:34:28.329 --> 00:34:31.889
and you serve, of course, you have to serve
it in the same skillet with a lot of crusty

00:34:31.889 --> 00:34:36.310
white bread to mop up the sauce and he made
shakshouka so famous, I don't think there

00:34:36.310 --> 00:34:41.169
is a tourist coming to Israel who go-, who
doesn't go to Dr. Shakshuka. But today, you

00:34:41.169 --> 00:34:46.770
can actually find all kinds of shakshoukas,
not necessarily with tomato sauce. For example,

00:34:46.770 --> 00:34:53.549
this is also a shakshouka. It's shakshouka
with spinach and goat cheese and it's delicious

00:34:53.549 --> 00:34:59.290
and light. The same idea, but without the
sauce, you just wilt, in this case, it's leek

00:34:59.290 --> 00:35:05.250
and pinach in spinach and then you break the
eggs and you crumble some feta cheese on top;

00:35:05.250 --> 00:35:14.640
very famous, very popular breakfast dish in
Israel in one of the fancy restaurant breakfasts.

00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:18.410
Another option, this is shakshouka actually
with ratatouille. You can take the ratatouille,

00:35:18.410 --> 00:35:23.850
if you have ratatouille left in the fridge,
or givech, some sort of stewed vegetables

00:35:23.850 --> 00:35:29.609
you can warm them in your skillet, break some
eggs on top, scramble cheese, and call it

00:35:29.609 --> 00:35:35.559
shakshouka, even though it really isn't. And
this is another version of spinach shakshouka,

00:35:35.559 --> 00:35:40.099
very-. If you go to Israel, to an Israeli
restaurant, you'll definitely find at least

00:35:40.099 --> 00:35:45.579
one version of shakshouka. Actually, I remember
on early 80s, when the Israeli cuisine, the

00:35:45.579 --> 00:35:50.210
sophisticated Israeli cuisine was taking it's
really first baby steps, we had this very,

00:35:50.210 --> 00:35:55.940
very famous restaurant called Killeen, owned
by Haim Cohen, a very, very famous Israeli

00:35:55.940 --> 00:36:02.180
chef, and he was basically preparing French
cuisine, very sort of Mediterranean, maybe

00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:03.740
a little bit, but not Israeli.

00:36:03.740 --> 00:36:09.289
He wouldn't serve any Israeli food because
they were considered too commonplace, nobody

00:36:09.289 --> 00:36:16.260
would pay lot of money to eat hummus, or tahini,
or stuff like that. And one day, for his lunch

00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:22.779
specialty, he prepared shakshouka with foie
gras, with goose liver, and it was a hit and

00:36:22.779 --> 00:36:28.140
he felt encouraged, and the next day he prepared
kabab with tahini for the special and audience

00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:33.520
loved it and we can say these are, this is
where the Israeli cuisine really starts getting

00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:39.630
interested. Because when we start relating
to our local traditions and from them drawing

00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:47.680
inspiration as well as from Jewish ethnic
cooking, this is how it all actually happens.

00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:53.619
Ok, and now, for the first time, I have something
that is really considered Jewish. Ok, and

00:36:53.619 --> 00:37:00.440
I brought it, also because, well, we all love
chicken soup, but also because many people

00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:05.990
think that when they go Israel, they're gonna
get to gefilte fish and chopped liver paradise.

00:37:05.990 --> 00:37:11.140
And they're very much surprised that there
is so little of that in Israel. We do have

00:37:11.140 --> 00:37:17.690
some, what we call Ashkenazi food, but it's
very, very rare. Actually, in the world, when

00:37:17.690 --> 00:37:23.059
you say Jewish food, you automatically mean
this kind of chopped liver, gefilte fish and

00:37:23.059 --> 00:37:28.230
stuff, but this is actually representative
only small part of Jewish cuisine; Jewish

00:37:28.230 --> 00:37:30.970
cuisine from Eastern Europe and Russia.

00:37:30.970 --> 00:37:36.160
The reason that it became synonymous with
Jewish food in general is because of massive

00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:41.490
waves of immigration of Russian and Polish
Jews coming to the States and to Canada in

00:37:41.490 --> 00:37:46.380
the beginning of 20th century. Many of them
went into food business, opened up restaurants

00:37:46.380 --> 00:37:52.160
and delis, and made this food world famous.
Many dishes, by the way, they invented here.

00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:57.069
For example, when I was born in Riga, former
Soviet Union, and that, the Ashkenazi land,

00:37:57.069 --> 00:38:04.130
so to speak, and I can tell you I've never
had bagel with cream cheese and lochs in Riga.

00:38:04.130 --> 00:38:09.281
I don't think even we know what cream cheese,
I mean, there was, there is no cream cheese

00:38:09.281 --> 00:38:16.140
in this area. This is an American invention,
and neither we had Reuben sandwich. It's 100%

00:38:16.140 --> 00:38:21.210
American, but I guess these dishes were prepared
in these delis, in these restaurants, still

00:38:21.210 --> 00:38:25.369
are, and they became synonymous with Jewish
food, but that's the whole beauty of it. There

00:38:25.369 --> 00:38:26.540
is nothing wrong with it.

00:38:26.540 --> 00:38:32.310
Make, this is important to understand, that's
how cuisines evolve. That's how Israeli cuisine

00:38:32.310 --> 00:38:37.820
evolves. That we take inspiration from various
dishes, we play around with them, we fuse

00:38:37.820 --> 00:38:41.940
them with something else, and this is actually
very good example and I have a personal story

00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:47.100
about this. This is Jewish chicken soup. And
it's, do you know what is this orange thing

00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:54.450
in, in the middle? What does it look like?
It's pumpkin, yeah. Now, those of you who

00:38:54.450 --> 00:38:59.869
know how to make Jewish chicken soup would
say, "Pumpkin? What is, what is pumpkin doing

00:38:59.869 --> 00:39:05.700
there?" Well, the thing is, when my book was
first published and it was reviewed in American

00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:10.950
press and I got, I must say, I'm glad to say,
very nice, favorable reviews, one of them,

00:39:10.950 --> 00:39:16.619
though, said that my Ashkenazi dishes are
not to be trusted because they're not authentic

00:39:16.619 --> 00:39:21.170
enough and as an example, my recipe for the
chicken soup was given.

00:39:21.170 --> 00:39:26.859
Now, it's important to emphasize, I'm not
a chef, I'm a food writer and the majority

00:39:26.859 --> 00:39:31.690
of recipes in my book are not my recipes,
they are recipes by famous Israeli chefs or

00:39:31.690 --> 00:39:36.099
very traditional recipe. This is my chicken
soup. I mean, I really know how to make a

00:39:36.099 --> 00:39:42.240
chicken soup and she said, this person, that
it's not authentic enough because she said,

00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:49.789
"Janna says use as many vegetables as you
like; leeks and celery and pumpkin." And she

00:39:49.789 --> 00:39:56.109
said, "And pumpkin? My Boba is turning in
her grave. You do not put pumpkin into chicken

00:39:56.109 --> 00:40:02.799
soup." And, well, I was sort of a little bit
irate in the beginning, but then I decided

00:40:02.799 --> 00:40:08.519
to check other Israeli recipes for chicken
soup and surprisingly enough, almost all of

00:40:08.519 --> 00:40:10.380
them had pumpkin.

00:40:10.380 --> 00:40:15.810
So, at this point, I sort of, I was almost
glad about this critic because it sort of

00:40:15.810 --> 00:40:22.859
gave me an insight on what Israeli cuisine
is because we may call it Jewish classic chicken

00:40:22.859 --> 00:40:28.829
soup, but it is already influenced by other
Jewish chicken soups that do have pumpkins

00:40:28.829 --> 00:40:35.350
and a bunch of other stuff. For example, this
one, this is Moroccan vegetable soup that

00:40:35.350 --> 00:40:42.000
you serve over couscous and it has pumpkin,
of course, and it has zucchini and it has

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:49.200
other stuff. And so, what happens because
Israeli society is very, very mixed, it's

00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:53.079
not just immigrant society, but intermarriage
is actually the norm.

00:40:53.079 --> 00:40:58.660
Almost, every Israeli you meet, you ask where
he or she is from, they would say, "My father

00:40:58.660 --> 00:41:03.359
is from Iraq, my mother is from Hungary. My
father is from Yemen, my mother is from Morocco."

00:41:03.359 --> 00:41:08.880
So, when there is this kind of intermarriage,
automatically there is cross-over on the plate.

00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:14.220
So, schnitzel and couscous during one lunch,
chicken soup that you can't really know where

00:41:14.220 --> 00:41:19.859
it comes from because it turns out that every
Jewish food culture has its own version of

00:41:19.859 --> 00:41:26.410
chicken soup. And pumpkin, sort of, cross
over from Balkan or Moroccan tradition right

00:41:26.410 --> 00:41:31.490
to Ashkenazi one and I think that's the whole
beauty of that. So, thank that, I don't remember

00:41:31.490 --> 00:41:37.079
her name, this critic that gave me this wonderful
insight.

00:41:37.079 --> 00:41:42.410
And now we come to malabi, another ola ka
dashni immigrant, this time from Turkey, it's

00:41:42.410 --> 00:41:49.380
a very sweet, lovely pudding made from water,
corn flour, milk, and rose essence. It started

00:41:49.380 --> 00:41:56.470
out as street snack that you would buy from
street carts and it developed into a very

00:41:56.470 --> 00:42:03.870
fancy dessert. That's how it would look like
in the restaurant. The red sauce, the raspberry

00:42:03.870 --> 00:42:08.740
sauce goes on the bottom instead of on top
and then you have the actual pudding and on

00:42:08.740 --> 00:42:13.800
top you have some nice little fruit compote,
an example of street food that turned into

00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:22.019
a restaurant dessert. And this is malabi cheesecake;
the same idea, but applied to cheesecake flavored

00:42:22.019 --> 00:42:24.140
with rose essence.

00:42:24.140 --> 00:42:31.049
And now we come to the last one of the dozen.
I just couldn't resist bringing this photo,

00:42:31.049 --> 00:42:36.450
which, in my opinion, is the most beautiful
photo in the book. And it's actually interesting

00:42:36.450 --> 00:42:39.230
because of; these are of course, pomegranates.

00:42:39.230 --> 00:42:46.210
And this is a pomegranate grove and, you know,
it's interesting with symbols. My book has

00:42:46.210 --> 00:42:51.579
pomegranates on the cover and two other Israeli
cookbooks, very, sort of, you know, cookbook

00:42:51.579 --> 00:42:58.010
coffee table books, published in English,
also have pomegranates on the cover. And frankly,

00:42:58.010 --> 00:43:01.900
and Sharon will correct me, we do not use
that many pomegranates in cooking. I mean,

00:43:01.900 --> 00:43:07.150
it's, we sometimes sprinkle them on top of,
on top of tabouli salads.

00:43:07.150 --> 00:43:12.380
I mean, people buy them because they are so
beautiful and you, they look nice in a bowl

00:43:12.380 --> 00:43:19.369
on the table, but during recent years when
the nutritionist discovered that they have

00:43:19.369 --> 00:43:25.930
all these amazing antioxidant qualities, somebody
became crazy, all of us became crazy for pomegranates

00:43:25.930 --> 00:43:30.430
and we started to grow them commercially in
Israel because ten years ago you would mainly

00:43:30.430 --> 00:43:36.170
find pomegranate trees in the backyard, like
one or two trees. Now, we have this amazingly

00:43:36.170 --> 00:43:43.299
beautiful pomegranates groves I think that
my, for me it looks like the, you know, the

00:43:43.299 --> 00:43:44.730
fruit of the Garden of Eden.

00:43:44.730 --> 00:43:51.131
Something that was the Adam and Eve are tempted
to eat and we are rediscovering, actually,

00:43:51.131 --> 00:43:56.120
things that we can do with pomegranates since
we so, have so many and for example, we can

00:43:56.120 --> 00:44:01.849
make this. This is one of my favorite chef,
his name is Erez Komarovsky, one of the most

00:44:01.849 --> 00:44:08.790
interesting and creative Israeli chefs. Here,
he makes a beet and pomegranate salad. A wonderful

00:44:08.790 --> 00:44:14.720
combination, same color, different texture,
different flavors, if you have pomegranates

00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:20.319
in season, try it. It takes two minutes; I
think it's one of the best salads in the book.

00:44:20.319 --> 00:44:27.730
And, here, and at this, where I want to finish,
I go back to Jewish ethnic cooking, which

00:44:27.730 --> 00:44:35.619
for me, is one of the most exciting aspects
of our food culture. As I told you, Jews have

00:44:35.619 --> 00:44:40.150
lived all over the world for centuries, for
thousands of years. Wherever they lived they

00:44:40.150 --> 00:44:45.960
created their own cuisines and we have all
of them now in Israel. It won't last long,

00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:50.809
by the way. It will be gone in a matter of
generation, too, because this is time consuming,

00:44:50.809 --> 00:44:57.210
labor intensive style of cooking and these
cuisines actually represent cultures that

00:44:57.210 --> 00:44:59.180
do not exist anymore.

00:44:59.180 --> 00:45:05.180
Think of it. There are no more Jews left neither
in Iraq nor Iran, Syria, Persia, so these

00:45:05.180 --> 00:45:11.580
are endangered species, but they still do
exist and those of you are interested in ethnic

00:45:11.580 --> 00:45:16.430
cooking and have access to these wonderful
cooks, should learn how to make a few recipes

00:45:16.430 --> 00:45:23.349
and try to preserve them for future generations.
What we have here, by the way, is the lady,

00:45:23.349 --> 00:45:28.349
I forgot her name, I'm afraid, I know, her
name is Rachel, actually. And she's from lovely

00:45:28.349 --> 00:45:33.420
Persian restaurant, in Kfar_Saba, a little
town near Tel Aviv, called Gohar, and the

00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:39.700
dish she's holding proudly in her hands are
lamb patties in fesenjan sauce. This is Persian

00:45:39.700 --> 00:45:46.549
sauce made from walnuts and pomegranates molasses
and served with fresh pomegranates and cilantro.

00:45:46.549 --> 00:45:53.819
Amazing dish, now existing in Israel, going
back all the way to thousand years ago when

00:45:53.819 --> 00:46:02.089
it was first created in, by Persian Jews and
for me this sort of closes the circle, the

00:46:02.089 --> 00:46:07.040
cycle of what we call Israeli cuisine, which
is cuisine in progress. We don't even know

00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:10.980
where it's going, but one thing I can tell
you, those of you who haven't been to Israel,

00:46:10.980 --> 00:46:17.410
or who have been, we're having some great,
terrific, fresh health food and it's only

00:46:17.410 --> 00:46:23.980
will get better with time, I think. Now, if
we have time for little tahini demo and you

00:46:23.980 --> 00:46:29.210
have energy, I'll be happy to oblige, if not,
I'm ready for questions so we can do both

00:46:29.210 --> 00:46:31.229
things simultaneously. And thank you very
much.
