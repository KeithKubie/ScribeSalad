00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.029
It’s been six years since Fukushima, so
based on their half lives: the iodine 131

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:11.070
has almost completely decayed and 88 percent
of the cesium-134 has decayed, but the cesium-137

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.410
is only decayed about a fifth.

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.720
Yikes.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.070
Up and atom friends, Trace here for DNews.

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.610
In case you are somehow unaware, Fukushima
Daiichi is a nuclear power facility damaged

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:27.910
unexpectedly by a tsunami and earthquake.

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.689
We’ve done some videos about it, and so
have some of you.

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.070
I’ve watched them.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.620
Fukushima is a touchy topic for some of you
out there.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.100
I know radiation can be scary, but just to
quickly reiterate, if you don’t live in

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.879
the immediate area around the nuclear disaster,
you’re fine.

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:44.809
But there’s news, y’all!

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:50.379
In 2011, the radiation levels in Reactor 2
were 73 sieverts per hour, that’s pretty

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:55.500
high -- but the latest reading says 530 per
hour (with a 30-percent error margin).

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.859
For reference, depending on the organ dosed
with radiation, 1 sievert can cause illness,

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:08.020
3 to 4 sieverts can be fatal in 30 days, 80
can cause coma and death within one hour,

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.200
and 100 can cause instant death.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.920
So 530 is a lot.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:12.920
Like.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:13.920
A LOT.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.280
But it’s all inside the reactor.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:16.280
That’s ridiculous.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.090
The increase could have happened slowly over
the last six years, as this is the first time

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:25.470
since just after the meltdown scientists were
actually able to sample the radiation.

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.310
Fascinatingly, the National Institute of Radiological
Sciences told Japan Times they’d never even

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.100
considered working with radiation this high,
which is scary.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.220
Now that the cleanup crews finally have access
to Reactor 2, they think they might be able

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.590
to start removing the nuclear material by
2021, some say later.

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.680
And, in case you fell victim to a fake news
story going around: no the reactors are not

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.610
collapsing into the ocean.

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.650
That said, it’s still a mess.

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:51.720
This is a unique situation.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.100
I mean, we’ve already learned a lot about
radiation from this disaster!

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.560
For example, a report published in the Annual
Review of Marine Science found radiation levels

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.720
in the ocean (except directly around the plant)
are “decreasing rapidly.”

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.840
Radiation on the seabed in the harbor is higher
than normal, but less than in 2011.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.490
Overall, off the coast of North America upper
ocean levels might be 2 to 3 times the nuclear

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.640
test levels seen in the 1960s, the study found.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.310
That would peak in 2015-16 and then drop.

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.750
Another said the radioactivity levels were
“rapidly returning to normal,” as of 2015.

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.710
Even the dose from the seabed is less than
the amount of radiation we get from natural

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:34.990
sources annually -- less than the radiation
someone gets on a flight from New York to

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:36.320
Japan.

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.210
They specifically said the risk to humans
is very low.

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:43.170
And if you’re worried about fish… a study
in Integrated Environmental Assessment and

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.870
Management found the biggest worry is for
bottom-feeders, and those that eat them.

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:53.490
Tuna, for example, while slightly more radioactive,
are still safe to eat (not to mention, delicious).

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:57.910
Overall radioactivity is variable, and the
fish we eat are required to be tested before

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.380
they’re on sent to consumers.

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.750
Basically, as we’ve said before, Fukushima
is and was a disaster, but like any disaster,

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.980
there’s a lot to learn, and if you don’t
live near the actual plant, you’re not going

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.690
to experience any more radiation than you’d
get from natural sources.

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:17.350
In fact, a study in the Journal of Radiological
Protection found even people from Fukushima

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.150
have been exposed to four times less radiation
than the Japanese government thought they

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.790
would, in part because people weren’t spending
a lot of time outside.

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.010
They didn’t plan for this, but we can get
better because of it.

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.250
Another Fukushima could happen.

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.520
Someone will have to invent, innovate and
engineer our way out of this mess and predict

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.520
and prepare for the next one.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.150
Even the cows in Fukushima have been studied!

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.410
They’re experiencing 15 times normal radiation,
but have no fertility or organ issues.

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.140
This is the first time scientists have studied
livestock in low-dose radiation, so there’s

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:49.140
a lot to learn.

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:50.160
It’s super interesting!

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.970
In late 2016, the government estimated 70
percent of the 150,000 people evacuated six

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:00.260
years ago will get to return home, and yet,
the topsoil and a lot of tree bark has stripped

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.530
after absorbing radioactive fallout, buildings
were destroyed, some of the groundwater is

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.750
contaminated, and the power plant will still
be nearby as cleanup progresses for the next

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.770
half-century -- it’s assumed to cost nearly
190 billion dollars.

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:15.890
You really can never go home again.

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:20.231
Want to know more about Fukushima if the radiation
is affecting the west coast of the U.S.? Watch

00:04:20.231 --> 00:04:21.231
this video.

00:04:21.231 --> 00:04:22.590
How do you feel about this?

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.410
Should keep using nuclear power?

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:25.410
Why or why not?
