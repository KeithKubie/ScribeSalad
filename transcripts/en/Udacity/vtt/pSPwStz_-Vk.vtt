00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.860
So the question that I'm posing to you is.

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:06.350
I'm giving you these four page faulting scenarios. And

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:08.170
I want you to fill in the table with

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:12.120
what happens to the boundary between the local and the

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.360
global split on each node. And this column is

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.900
giving you the location of the faulting page. Where it

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.380
is in the entire system. And this column is

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.480
saying what happens to the split of L and G

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:31.270
on the faulting node. What happens to the split of L and G on the node that

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:37.170
happens to have the faulting page? And what happens to the split between L and G

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.520
for the node that has the globally oldest

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.520
page? The LRU page in the entire cluster which

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.830
shall be the victim of place replacement, throwing

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.930
it out on to the disc. If some page

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:52.860
has to be gotten out of the cluster

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.800
because the memory pressure in the entire cluster

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.460
exceeds the total memory that's available in the

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.310
entire cluster. The first choice is the faulting page

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:09.290
X, is in Q's global cache. That's a first choice. In that case I

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:16.080
want you to think about what happens to the spread of L and G on node P, node Q,

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.150
and node R. In the second case, faulting page X is in the

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.230
global part of Q. And the difference is, P's global is

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:31.290
already empty. In the first case, P's global was not empty, so I

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.040
wanted you to think about the split between L

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.760
and G, and note P as well. In the second

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.100
case, I'm saying it is similar to the first

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.960
one, with a difference that P's global cache is empty.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.730
And the third case is the faulting page is on the disk. It is not in the cluster

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:53.460
memory of any of the nodes. And the last case is when this faulting page X

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.930
is actively shared by both P and Q. All of theses cases are the ones that we

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.270
just we discussed, and so I just wanted you

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.930
to think about it and fill in this table.
