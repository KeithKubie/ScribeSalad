00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.050
The National Academy of Sciences was
formed by President Abraham Lincoln

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:08.640
to provide independent
objective advice to the nation

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.010
on matters related to science and
technology.

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.079
For many years its healthcare component,
The Institute of Medicine,

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:20.540
which recently became The Academy of
Medicine, was instrumental in raising

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:24.010
the alarm that U.S. healthcare has
the problems we've been discussing.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.690
The institute has called for
a new, learning health system.

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:32.170
We don't have time to discuss that in
detail, but here's a simple health

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:37.130
infomatics perspective that shows how
electronic records, if they're adopted

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:42.460
and can share data, become a source of
information from actual patient care.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.350
It can then be aggregated and analyzed
to develop new knowledge, that in turn,

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.840
through an informatics powered feedback
loop, leads to continuous improvement.
