00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.340
It's the sequel everyone was waiting for, literally  since the end credits of the last one:

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.680
After one of the most hyped up and biggest blockbusters of all time came out

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.060
Everyone was waiting what the second one was going to be.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.900
Was it going to be bigger? Was it going to be better? Was it going to be funnier?

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.080
In some respects, yeah! It IS all those things.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:38.760
In other respects, it's kind of hard to keep the 'wow' factor going after such a groundbreaking last one

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.380
Does that make it bad? ...No. Does that make it better than the first one?

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.080
I'd... It's... [Sigh]
It's complicated.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:50.040
Okay, let's look at this set-up:
The Avengers assemble once again in order to get Loki's Scepter

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.900
Huh... They didn't meet up for all those other times the world was about to be destro----

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.500
It's a comic book, don't think about it.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.500
But Tony Stark's mind is manipulated by another character called Scarlet Witch

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.260
who makes him see a distroyed future that apparently he's responsible for.

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:12.220
Like an idiot, he reads it as 'I didn't do enough', so he creates this computer that's apparently going to create peace in our time.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:17.060
Oh, come on. He didn't think that maybe THIS is what would cause all those terrible things to happen?

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.580
Because, y'know, the audience is ten steps ahead of him on that.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.440
But, whatever... He creates this computer program known as 'Ultron'

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.500
Ultron, of course, wants to create peace in his time, but in the way that he knows how:

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.260
By getting rid of everyone!
Oops, forgot to overlook that glitch.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.180
So now, ultron is trying to destroy the world by making tons of different versions of himself,

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.960
Trying to raise a giant city as a meteor, and smash it into the world.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:47.520
And the avengers have to overcome their new mental problems, as well as new physical problems, in order to stop him.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.380
So, yeah. Pretty weak plot, but again, the first film had a pretty weak plot, too. And that didn't matter.

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.760
We just wanted to see the Avengers get together, and fight, and work off of each other and say those great 
one-liners.

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.340
And in Avengers 2, we get all of that. Plus more, actually.

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.280
There's a wonderful scene where they've all been mentally ripped apart

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.820
and so they go to this cabin to try and get away.

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.600
It's easilly the best thing in the film, because we haven't seen anything like that before.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:18.380
It felt like the Avengers were actually evolving as characters... and through a way they hadn't really done yet.

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.820
So, in some respects, it's exactly what we wanted.
But in others...

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:28.380
Don't we want to see something we didn't KNOW we wanted? Like that cabin scene?

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:34.280
And don't get me wrong! I love that cabin scene! but why is there only one scene like this in the movie, and not more?

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.280
It's kind of weird, because the film does kind of feel like it's on repeat.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:44.800
Here's all these action scenes, all these one liners and... They're good! They're well done, There's nothign wrong with them.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.360
But there's nothing really new about them, either. The 'wow' factor from this is kind of gone because

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.200
because there aren't really any new avengers for them to interact off of.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:59.680
I mean, Okay. There's this Scarlet Witch, and this fast guy. And they create this other one called The Vision...

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.480
And at the end, they indicate that there's even more being added to the mix, but

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.260
all these other characters had their own movies!

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.800
Half of these people are being introduced in this film! And the other ones,

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:14.320
they were just kind of side characters. We're not exactly excited to see them here.

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.860
Now, they're not bad, but they're no Thor, or Iron Man, or Captain America.

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.880
There's also a totally out of nowhere romance between Black Widow and The Hulk.

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:29.860
And it's... good. Again, not bad... but I'm not exactly going to lose sleep if I don't see them get together.

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.060
But again, it IS evolving the characters to a different place than when we started

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:40.080
I do feel like I found out more about these people after watching this film than I did after watching the first Avengers

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.700
That's something that was really missing in the last movie.

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:50.420
But with everything else, even if it's done good, the investment isn't quite as strong because we've kind of seen this stuff before.

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.060
A bad guy who doesn't see destroying the world as a bad thing

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.680
and he tries to make up some philosophical bullshit about why it's not.

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:03.580
People being hypnotized to do his will, the whole world about to be destroyed in one city

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:09.680
And again, I hate talking this way, because it's done well. In many respects, it's done better than the first film.

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.720
But it's not evolving anything that much.

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.300
And don't get me wrong, the audience had a fun time with this.

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:20.580
They were laughing, they were applauding, they were gasping, they were doing all the things that audiences are supposed to do.|

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:25.900
But when it was all said and done, there wasn't this standing ovation like there was at the first film.

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:31.020
Because the first film gave us a lot of what we never saw and really wanted to see

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.620
This gave us what we thought we were going to see. So it's hard to say, because

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.420
on the one hand, it is kind of better than the original.

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:41.920
We do learn more about these people, there is the wonderful scene at the house,

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:46.640
The action IS upped, there are more one-liners, we do see a lot more of the avengers together...

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:50.020
Hell, there's literally one scene where they're just hanging out at a party.

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.060
I could just watch THIS the whole entire time, they're so interesting.

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:59.580
I guess the real problem is... it's not an experience. It's a sequel to an experience

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:05.620
trying to clearly be better, and in some cases it is, but because we've already seen a lot of this before

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.600
it's not as much blowing us away.

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.820
But it's still a lot of fun. I definitely recommend it.

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:15.160
Does it have stuff that doesn't make sense, and are there elements that are clearly filler for other movies?

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.340
Sure, but so did the first one.

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.820
I don't think this is the groundbreaking sequel they were hoping for, but

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:24.340
at the same time, we didn't get a bad film by any means.

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:30.220
I think if they did want to blow us away, they could include a lot more, like why aren't the Guardians of the Galaxy in there?

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:33.320
Why isn't there a Spiderman cameo? You just got him.

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:38.040
Now, don't get me wrong, these are all tie-ins that maybe I don't understand, I mean...

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:42.220
the fact that any of this is happening in Hollywood is pretty amazing, so maybe they couldn't pull it off.

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:44.920
But that's the reason people weren't as blown away.

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:48.540
They wanted a lot more, and instead, they got a little more.

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:53.400
In many respects, I do like this more than the first one. Hell, I probably prefer watching this one to the first one.

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:58.640
but it's not the groundbreaking follow-up that I think audiences, as well as  the studio, was hoping for.

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:03.240
But hell with what it isn't, and concentrate on what it is: A lot of fun and really enjoyable.

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:08.720
If you don't go in overhyped, and just want to see the Avengers be the Avengers, this is definitely a fun one to check out.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.960
Assemble your team of friends, and take a look.
