warming we promised lots of carbon cups

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400

but none have occurred we promised in

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470

carbon cuffs and virtually didn't do any

of them and of course in Copenhagen last

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140
of them and of course in Copenhagen last
 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.950
of them and of course in Copenhagen last
year we had a complete breakdown instead

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960
year we had a complete breakdown instead
 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.350

of going further down that road to

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360
of going further down that road to
 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.590
of going further down that road to
nowhere of Rio Kyoto Copenhagen we

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600
nowhere of Rio Kyoto Copenhagen we
 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.299
nowhere of Rio Kyoto Copenhagen we
should be focusing on a different and

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309
should be focusing on a different and
 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.270
should be focusing on a different and
very very much simpler strategy we

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280
very very much simpler strategy we
 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.100
very very much simpler strategy we
should be investing dramatically more in

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110
should be investing dramatically more in
 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.510
should be investing dramatically more in
research and development into green

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520
research and development into green
 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.490
research and development into green
energy because if we can make green

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500
energy because if we can make green
 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.010
energy because if we can make green
energy cheaper than fossil fuels we will

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020
energy cheaper than fossil fuels we will
 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.020
energy cheaper than fossil fuels we will
all switch not just rich well-meaning

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030
all switch not just rich well-meaning
 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.210
all switch not just rich well-meaning
Westerners but also China and India and

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:53.220
Westerners but also China and India and
 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.550
Westerners but also China and India and
everybody else so fundamentally we

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:55.560
everybody else so fundamentally we
 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.520
everybody else so fundamentally we
should be pledging to spend 0.2 percent

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530
should be pledging to spend 0.2 percent
 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.620
should be pledging to spend 0.2 percent
of our gdp on research and development

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:00.630
of our gdp on research and development
 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.380
of our gdp on research and development
into green energy technology it'll be

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390
into green energy technology it'll be
 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.679
into green energy technology it'll be
half the cost of Kyoto it will be 50

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689
half the cost of Kyoto it will be 50
 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:07.940
half the cost of Kyoto it will be 50
times more than what we're spending

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950
times more than what we're spending
 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.530
times more than what we're spending
currently on research and development

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540
currently on research and development
 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.170
currently on research and development
and the amazing thing is that for every

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180
and the amazing thing is that for every
 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.709
and the amazing thing is that for every
dollar spent we will avoid 500 times

00:01:15.709 --> 00:01:15.719
dollar spent we will avoid 500 times
 

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:18.649
dollar spent we will avoid 500 times
more climate damage in the long run so

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659
more climate damage in the long run so
 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.169
more climate damage in the long run so
we can do more good much more

00:01:21.169 --> 00:01:21.179
we can do more good much more
 

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:23.510
we can do more good much more
effectively at lower costs that ought to

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520
effectively at lower costs that ought to
 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.319
effectively at lower costs that ought to
be the solution for the future
