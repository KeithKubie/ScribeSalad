00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.820
Hi, I'm Carrie Anne and welcome to Crash Course Computer Science.

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:09.840
Early in this series we covered computing history from roughly the dawn of civilization,

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.900
up to the birth of electronic general purpose computers in the mid 1940s.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.560
A lot of the material we've discussed over the past 23 episodes

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.920
like programming languages and compilers

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.440
algorithms and integrated circuits

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.800
Floppy disks and operating systems, telly types and screens

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:30.000
all emerged over roughly a 30-year period, from the mid 1940s up to the mid 1970s

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:34.880
This is the era of computing before companies like Apple and Microsoft existed

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.680
and long before anyone tweeted, Googled or Uber-d.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.140
It was a formative period setting the stage for personal computers,

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.980
worldwide web, self-driving cars virtual reality, and many other topics

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.380
we'll get to in the second half of this series.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.040
Today we're going to step back from circuits and algorithms and review this influential period.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:58.040
We'll pay special attention to the historical backdrop of the cold war, the space race and the rise of globalization and consumerism.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.420
Pretty much immediately after World War II concluded in 1945,

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.400
there was tension between the world's two new superpowers the United States and the USSR

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.880
The Cold War had begun and with it, massive government spending on science and engineering.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.300
Computing which had already demonstrated its value in wartime efforts like the Manhattan Project

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.140
and code breaking Nazi communications,

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.360
was lavished with government funding. They enabled huge ambitious computing projects to be undertaken,

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.400
like ENIAC, EDVAC, Atlas and Whirlwind all mentioned in previous episodes.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.080
This spurred rapid advances that simply weren't possible in the commercial sector alone,

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.480
where projects were generally expected to recoup development costs through sales.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:47.480
This began to change in the early 1950s, especially with Eckert and Buckley's Univac 1,

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.300
the first commercially successful computer.

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.320
Unlike any Echo Atlas, this wasn't just one single computer.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.520
It was a model of computers, in total more than 40 were built.

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.520
Most of these Univacs went to government offices or large companies.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:06.760
Which was part of the growing military industrial complex in the United States, with pockets deep enough to afford the cutting edge.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:12.160
Famously a Univac one built for the U.S atomic energy commission was used by CBS to predict the results of

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:20.460
the 1952 U.S. presidential election. With just 1% of the vote the computer correctly predicted an Eisenhower landslide while pundits favored Stevenson.

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:25.000
It was a media event that helped propel computing to the forefront of the public's imagination

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Computing was unlike machines of the past, which generally augmented human physical abilities.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.740
Trucks allowed us to carry more automatic looms whoa faster

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:38.140
Machine tools were more precise and so on for a bunch of contraptions that typify the industrial revolution.

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.800
But computers on the other hand could augment human intellect.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.320
This potential wasn't lost on Vannevar Bush, who in 1945 published an article

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.260
on a hypothetical computing device he envisioned called the Memex.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.100
This was a device in which an individual stores all his books, records and communications

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.340
and which is mechanized, so it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.080
It is an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.680
He also predicted that wholly new forms of encyclopedia will appear,

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.980
ready-made, with a mesh of associative trails running through them. Sound familiar?

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.460
Memex directly inspired several subsequent game-changing systems,

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:14.260
like Ivan Sutherland Sketchpad, which we discussed last episode,

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.300
and Dough Engelbart's online system, which we will cover soon.

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.020
Vannevar Bush was the head of the U.S. office of Scientific Research and Development,

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:25.800
which was responsible for funding and coordinating scientific research during World War Two.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.840
With the Cold War brewing, Bush lobbied for a creation of a peace time equivalent,

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.880
the National Science Foundation, formed in 1950.

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:38.320
To this day the NSF provides federal funding to support scientific research in the United States.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.760
And it is a major reason the U.S. has continued to be a leader in the technology sector.

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.280
It was also in the 1950s that consumers started to buy transistor powered gadgets,

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.460
notable among them was the transistor radio, which was small, durable and battery-powered.

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:55.940
And it was portable, unlike the vacuum tube based radio sets from the 1940s and before.

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.540
It was a runaway success, the furby or iphone of its day.

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.840
The Japanese government looking for industrial opportunities, to bolster their post-war economy,

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.580
soon got in on the action. Licensing the rights to Transistors from Bell Labs in 1952.

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:12.400
Helping launch the Japanese semiconductor and electronics industry.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.260
In 1955, the first Sony product was released:

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:19.480
The TR-55 Transistor Radio. Concentrating on quality and price,

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:24.680
Japanese companies captured half of the U.S. Market for portable radios in just five years.

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.260
This planted the first seeds of a major industrial rivalry in the decades to come.

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.320
In 1953, there were only around 100 computers on the entire planet

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.700
and at this point, the USSR was only a few years behind the West in computing technology,

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.540
completing their first programmable electronic computer in 1950.

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:45.780
But the Soviets were way ahead in the burgeoning space race. Let's go to the thought-bubble.

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.520
The Soviets launched the world's first satellite into orbit, Sputnik one,

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.120
in 1957 and a few years later in 1961.

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:56.520
Soviet Cosmonaut, Yuri Gagarin became the first human in space.

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.420
This didn't sit well with the American public

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:01.320
and prompted President Kennedy, a month after Gagarin's mission,

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:06.140
to encourage the nation to land a man on the moon within the decade. And it was expensive!

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:12.720
Nasa's budget grew almost tenfold, peaking in 1966 at roughly 4.5 percent of the u.s. Federal budget today

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.350
It's around half a percent

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:19.540
Nasa used this funding to tackle a huge array of enormous challenges this culminated in the apollo program

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:21.700
Which is peak employed roughly?

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:29.080
400,000 people further supported by over 20,000 universities and companies one of these huge challenges was navigating in space

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:36.699
Nasa needed a computer to process complex trajectories and issue Guidance commands to the spacecraft for this they built the apollo guidance computer

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:43.778
There were three significant requirements first the computer had to be fast no surprise there second it has to be small and lightweight

00:05:43.819 --> 00:05:49.269
there's not a lot of room in a spacecraft and every ounce is precious when you're flying a quarter million miles to the moon and

00:05:49.339 --> 00:05:52.479
Finally it had to be really really ridiculously reliable

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:57.248
This is super important in a spacecraft where there's lots of vibration radiation and temperature change

00:05:57.249 --> 00:06:02.799
And there's no running to best buy it something breaks the technology of the era of vacuum Tubes and discrete transistors

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:08.079
Just weren't up to the task so Nasa turned to a brand-new technology integrated circuits

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:13.959
Which we discussed a few episodes ago the apollo guidance computer was the first computer to use them a huge paradigm shift

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:21.729
Nasa was also the only place that could afford them initially each chip cost around $50 and the guidance computer needed thousands of them

00:06:21.729 --> 00:06:25.868
But by paying that price the Americans were able to beat the soviets to the moon

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:32.679
Thanks, thought-bubble although the apollo Guidance computer is credited with spurring the development and adoption of integrated circuits

00:06:32.679 --> 00:06:38.979
It was a low volume product there are only 17 apollo missions after all it was actually military applications

00:06:38.979 --> 00:06:44.468
Especially the minuteman and polaris nuclear missile systems that allowed integrated circuits to become a mass-produced

00:06:44.809 --> 00:06:48.279
Item this rapid Advancement was further accelerated by the u.s.

00:06:48.279 --> 00:06:55.328
Building and buying huge powerful computers often called supercomputers because they were frequently 10 times faster than any other computer on the planet

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:59.409
Upon their release but these machines built by companies Like CDC cray

00:06:59.409 --> 00:07:06.159
And Ibm were also super in cost and pretty much only governments could afford to buy them in the us these machines went to government

00:07:06.159 --> 00:07:12.938
Agencies like the NSA and government research labs like Lawrence Livermore and Los Alamos National laboratories initially the u.s.

00:07:13.159 --> 00:07:16.748
semiconductor industry boomed buoyed by High profit government contracts

00:07:16.879 --> 00:07:22.359
However this meant that most us companies overlooked the consumer market where profit Margins were small the Japanese

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:28.329
Semiconductor industry came to dominate this niche by having to operate with lean profit margins in the 1950s and 60s

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:33.729
the Japanese had invested heavily in manufacturing capacity to achieve economies of scale in

00:07:34.069 --> 00:07:41.558
Research to improve quality and Yields and in automation to keep manufacturing costs low in the 1970s with the space Race and cold war subsiding

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:44.649
previously juicy defense contracts began to dry up and

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:51.130
Consumer conductor and electronics companies found it harder to compete it didn't help the many computing components had been commoditized

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:52.720
Be around with Dram

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:56.739
So why buy expensive intel memory when you could buy the same chip for less from Hitachi?

00:07:57.110 --> 00:08:04.929
Throughout the 1970s us companies began to downsize consolidate or outright fail intel had to lay off a third of its Workforce in

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:09.279
1974 and even the storied Fairchild semiconductor was acquired in

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:16.179
1979 after near bankruptcy to survive many of these companies began to outsource their manufacturing in a bid to reduce costs

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:21.850
Intel weave drew from its main product category memory Ics and decided to refocus on processes

00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:24.549
Which ultimately saved the company this low and us?

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:30.489
electronics industry allowed Japanese companies like Sharp and Casio to dominate the Breakout computing product of the

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:38.710
1970s Handheld electronic calculators by using integrated circuits these could be made small and cheap they replaced

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:41.439
Expensive desktop adding machines you find in offices

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:46.539
For most people it was the first time they didn't have to do math on paper, or use a slide rule

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:49.000
They were an instant hit selling by the millions

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:55.599
This server drove down the cost of integrated circuits and led to the development and widespread use of micro processors like the intel

00:08:55.850 --> 00:08:57.850
4004 we've discussed previously

00:08:58.010 --> 00:09:04.539
This chip was built by intel in 1971 at the request of Japanese calculator company busy calm soon

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:11.020
Japanese electronics were everywhere from televisions of VcRs to digital wristwatches and Walkmans the availability of inexpensive

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:18.189
microprocessor Spawned in Highly new Products like video arcades the world got pong in 1972 and Breakout in

00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:25.090
1976 as cost continued to plummet soon it became possible for regular people to afford computing devices during this time

00:09:25.090 --> 00:09:28.599
we see the emergence of the first successful home computers like the

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:34.900
1975 Altair 8800 and also the first home gaming consoles like the Atari 2600 in

00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:40.030
1977 home now, I repeat that home that seems like a small thing today

00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:46.359
But this was the dawn of a whole new era in computing in just three decades computers have evolved from machines where you could literally?

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:52.599
Walk inside of the cPU assuming you had government clearance to the point where a child could play with a handheld toy

00:09:52.820 --> 00:10:00.100
Containing a microprocessor many times faster, critically this dramatic evolution would have been but without two powerful forces at play

00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:02.570
governments and consumers

00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:05.590
government funding like the United States provided during the cold war

00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:11.140
enabled early adoption of many nascent computing technologies this funding helped flow entire

00:10:11.270 --> 00:10:18.549
Industries relate into computing long enough for the technology to mature and become commercially feasible then businesses and ultimately consumers

00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:23.949
Provided the demand to take it mainstream the cold war may be over, but this relationship continues today

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:31.299
Governments are still funding science research intelligence agencies are still buying supercomputers humans are still being launched into space

00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:36.850
And you're still buying TVs xboxes playstations laptops and smartphones and for these reasons

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:41.020
Computing continues to Advance a lightning pace. I'll see you next week

00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:45.400
crash course computer science is produced in association with PBS digital studios

00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:49.720
At their channel you can check out a playlist of shows like Physics Goldie flicks

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:55.209
And PBs space time this episode was filmed at the Chad and stacey ever thought studio in Indianapolis, Indiana

00:10:55.210 --> 00:10:59.769
And it was made with the help of all these nice people and our wonderful graphic scene thought cafe

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:02.920
That's where we're going to have to halt and catch fire. See you next week

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:18.240
you
