SHEIKH AHMED AL KHALIFA &gt;&gt; Hello, my name
is Ahmed Al Khalifa. I am the Minister of

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.379
Finance in the Kingdom of _______. I think
the most important thing that we can do in

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.820
2008 as countries and as companies is to really
focus on the environment. I think that is

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:19.795
a critical issue for us all. If we want to
continue to live in this world and see our

00:00:19.795 --> 00:00:22.039
children and grandchildren live in the same
world which we live in, I think focusing on

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:25.390
the environment will be a very important issue
for us. Thank you.
