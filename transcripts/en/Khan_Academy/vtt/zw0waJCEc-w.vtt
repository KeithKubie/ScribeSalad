00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:01.700
Welcome back.

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:05.380
I'm now going to do a proof
of a trig identity, which

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.520
I think is pretty amazing.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.660
Although, I think, the
proof isn't that obvious.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.250
And I'll have to admit ahead of
time, this isn't something that

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:14.070
would have occurred
to me naturally.

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.802
I wouldn't have naturally
drawn this figure just

00:00:16.802 --> 00:00:20.010
to start off with.

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.740
Let's just say we want to
figure out some other way to

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:33.440
write the sine of alpha plus
beta, where alpha and beta are

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:34.580
let's say, two separate angles.

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:42.180
So if I had the sine of 40 and
50 degrees, I'd want to know--

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.140
this would obviously be the
sine of 90, which is easy.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.040
But could I rewrite that as
some combination of the sine

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.280
of 40 and the sine
of 50 or whatever?

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.040
I think you'll see
where this is going.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.790
So let's go back to this
diagram and let's say

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.040
that this-- let me
pick a better color.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:01.710
Let's say that this is angle
alpha and this is angle beta.

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:12.020
Than this whole angle right
here is angle alpha plus beta.

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.970
So we want to figure out the
sine of alpha plus beta.

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.810
Well, the sine of alpha plus
beta, the sine of this

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.120
whole angle, opposite
over hypotenuse.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:24.440
Opposite this whole angle is if
we use this right angle-- or

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.830
this right triangle,
triangle BAC.

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:33.262
Opposite is BC, so
that equals BC.

00:01:33.262 --> 00:01:35.170
I'll draw a little
line over it.

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.790
BC over the hypotenuse, AB.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.650
BC over AB is the sine
of alpha plus beta.

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:53.770
Well, can be write BC
over AB differently?

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:54.900
Let's see if we can.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.920
And probably, the person who
first figured out this proof

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.440
was just playing around.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.090
They drew this diagram,
they said, can I write

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.480
BC any differently?

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:08.730
Well BC-- this whole length--
is the sum of BD and EF.

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:11.070
And we know that because this
is a horizontal line right now

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:12.620
and you can figure that out
just by looking at all

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:13.750
the right angles.

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:14.800
But this is a horizontal line.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.970
So BC is the same
thing is BD plus EF.

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:20.880
Let's write that one down.

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:30.750
BC is the same thing
as BD plus EF.

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.290
And then still, all
of that, over AB.

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.730
All I did is I rewrote BC as a
sum of this segment and this

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.700
segment, which should make
sense to you, hopefully.

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:52.970
And then we can of course,
rewrite that as equal to BD

00:02:52.970 --> 00:03:05.460
over AB plus EF over AB.

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:13.060
So BD over AB plus EF over AB.

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.020
And these are kind of
nonsensical ratios, right?

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:16.920
BD over AB, what can
I do with that?

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.420
And EF over AB, what
can I do with that?

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.190
Wouldn't it be more interesting
if I could do like BD over BE.

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.520
That'd be an interesting ratio
because that would be a

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.500
segment over its hypotenuse.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.400
So let's see if we can rewrite
it somehow like that.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.610
Well, we could just do
it mathematically.

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:52.900
We could say this is equal to
BD over BE times BE over AB.

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.560
So this might seem
non-intuitive to you, but

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:55.820
it kind of makes sense.

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.505
We didn't pick BE
completely arbitrarily.

00:03:57.505 --> 00:04:01.750
We said we know what BD is, so
let me pick another side that I

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.130
can do something maybe
with real trig ratios.

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:10.330
And so I said BD over
BE times BE over AB is

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:12.380
equal to BD over AB.

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.190
I hope I don't confuse you
with all these letters.

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:15.210
But that makes sense, right?

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:16.850
Because these two terms
would just cancel out.

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:18.430
If we're just multiplying these
fractions then you would

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.770
get back to this top term.

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:24.090
Let me actually make sure
that you understand

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:25.240
that this-- whoops.

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.630
That this term and this
term are the same thing.

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:31.810
And now let's do
that second term.

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.960
We know EF, wouldn't it be good
if we could relate EF to

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.570
something, like it's the
hypotenuse of this

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:38.280
right triangle?

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.220
Like AE.

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:40.075
So let's do that.

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.750
So let's put the
plus sign there.

00:04:44.750 --> 00:05:01.450
EF over AB is the same thing as
EF over AE times AE over AB.

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:03.480
Once again, we're just
multiplying fractions.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.170
These would cancel out and
you would get this again.

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:10.760
Let me make sure you understand
that this term is the

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:11.660
same thing as this term.

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:13.560
And you can just multiple out
the fractions and that's

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.570
what you would get.

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:19.920
Now before we progress
with this whole line of

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:20.900
thought that we're doing.

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:22.860
Let's see if we could figure
out something else interesting

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.990
about this strange set of
triangles and shapes

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.850
that I've drawn.

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:30.060
It's actually pretty neat.

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:36.390
IF this angle is alpha--
we have line AF.

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:38.800
EF is perpendicular
to it, right?

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.450
And DE is perpendicular
to EF, right?

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:45.260
So DE, this line, and
AF are parallel.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:51.110
Since AF is parallel to DE and
then, AE intersects both,

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:52.350
we know that, what is that?

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:53.460
The inner angles?

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:55.780
Yeah, I think that's
called inner angles

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:56.730
with parallel lines.

00:05:56.730 --> 00:06:01.080
That this is also
equal to alpha.

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:04.330
You can imagine long parallel
line here, long parallel here,

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:05.890
and then this line
intersects both.

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:08.500
So if this is a little
confusing maybe you want to

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:11.880
review a little bit of the
parallel line geometry, but I

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:13.150
think this might make sense.

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:17.380
So if this angle is alpha,
then this angle right here

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:19.300
is complementary to it.

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:20.740
So it's 90 minus alpha.

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:26.600
And if this angle is
90 minus alpha, this

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.480
angle is obviously 90.

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:31.210
Then we know that this angle
plus this angle plus this

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:32.460
angle has to equal 180.

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:35.620
So we know that this
is equal to alpha.

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:38.980
If that doesn't make sense to
you, think about this: alpha

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:44.070
plus 90 minus alpha plus
90-- that's a minus.

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:45.370
Minus alpha.

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:47.120
Plus 90 is what?

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:48.760
Alpha plus 90 minus alpha.

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:51.920
So this minus alpha and alpha
cancel out and you just have 90

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:54.080
plus 90 and that equals 180.

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:55.775
So we know that this angle
right here, I know it's

00:06:55.775 --> 00:06:57.980
getting really small and
probably hard to read.

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:01.940
We know that this
angle here is alpha.

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:03.730
So let's get back to what
we were progressing,

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:05.060
what we were doing here.

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:09.190
So what is BD over BE?

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:12.850
BD over BE.

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:15.990
Well, that's the adjacent
to this alpha, which is

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:17.690
the same angle really.

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:23.530
BD over BE, so it's
adjacent over hypotenuse.

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:24.630
Cosine.

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:28.780
So that is equal to
the cosine of alpha.

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:35.360
And what's BE over AB?

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:44.770
Well, if we look at this larger
right triangle, that is the

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:50.230
opposite of beta times
its hypotenuse.

00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:52.620
So what's opposite
over hypotenuse?

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:53.740
SOH.

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:54.710
S O H.

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:55.480
Sine.

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:59.000
So sine of beta is BE over AB.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.310
So this is sine of beta.

00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:10.780
And now let me
switch to magenta.

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:13.610
What's EF over AE?

00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:19.960
If we look at this right
triangle right here,

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:24.220
is opposite over
hypotenuse for alpha.

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:26.050
So it's sine of alpha.

00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:27.030
Opposite over hypotenuse.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.660
And what's AE over AB?

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:40.330
So now we're looking at this
large right triangle here.

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:42.780
AE over AB.

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:46.710
Well, that's the adjacent of
beta over the hypotenuse.

00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:48.580
Well, what's adjacent
over hypotenuse?

00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:51.430
That's the cosine.

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:53.230
CAH.

00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:57.140
Cosine of beta, of
this beta right here.

00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:58.650
I think we're done.

00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:02.140
This is to me, fairly
mind blowing.

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:14.010
That the sine of alpha plus
beta is equal to the cosine of

00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:15.920
alpha times the sine of beta.

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:20.310
Plus the sine of alpha
times the cosine of beta.

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:22.590
What's neat about this is that
it kind of came out of this

00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:24.970
nice symmetric formula.

00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:27.370
It's not this big, hairy thing.

00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:28.530
You might have even guessed it.

00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:29.940
I don't know.

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:30.950
I just find it very neat.

00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:33.430
We went through this big
convoluted proof with this big

00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:37.780
convoluted shape, but we got
this nice symmetric trig

00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:38.980
identity out of it.

00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:41.780
So hopefully you found that
amazing as well and in the next

00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:45.900
presentation I'll do a proof
for cosine of alpha plus beta.

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:47.460
See you soon.
