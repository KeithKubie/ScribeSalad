00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:01.430
- Tell me about Big Loo.

00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:02.800
I mean, this is--

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.070
SELLER: Big Loo is one of the
top 10 pieces in the museum

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:06.400
probably.
- Really?

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.770
It is factory seal.
MIKE: Wow.

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:10.570
SELLER: The only
one known to exist.

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:12.030
- This is?
- Mint seal.

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.230
Never been opened.

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.030
And the person I
bought it from was

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.500
a person who designed Big Loo.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.330
What do you estimate
the value of that?

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:21.030
I've bought Big Loos
before missing pieces.

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:22.670
I mean, they were like,
$200-$300 bucks, easily.

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:23.800
Right?

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.270
I've got $200 or $300
Big Loos I'll sell you.

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:26.070
MIKE: Yeah, yeah,
that's what I'm saying.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.170
That's what I'd easily get.

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:28.200
Or I got an $18,000
Big Loo I'll sell you.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.500
MIKE: $18,000 Big Loo.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.200
Man, you could have this
or a pan head, Frank.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.270
Yeah.

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.600
Can we take Big Loo
out of the cabinet?

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.930
Nobody touches Big Loo.

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.270
FRANK: Uh oh.

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:39.030
All right.

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.270
Can I touch Frankenstein?

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:41.430
Yeah, you can
touch Frankenstein.

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.730
MIKE: All right.
I'm going to touch Frank.

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.130
SELLER: You can bring him
out of the case if you want.

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:45.200
MIKE: Oh, I'm bringing him out.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.770
I love early Frankenstein stuff.

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.130
[music playing]

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:58.870
You know who had him, don't you?

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:00.970
Silver Fox, Dave Ward.
- He did?

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.030
He had one in his case next
to his chair in the living room.

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.670
One of the toys that Dave had
was this Frankenstein toy.

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.670
That's the first time I've
ever seen one of these.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.700
So I have a connection to it.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.900
Not from playing with
it when I was a kid,

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.130
but from seeing it
for the first time

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.670
at Dave's house and kind
of falling in love with it.

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.730
SELLER: You know the
face looks really nice.

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:22.330
MIKE: Yeah.
SELLER: Kind of ugly, but--

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:23.300
What are you thinking on this?

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:27.870
Oh, man it's--
SELLER: $275

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:29.630
He's so cool.

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.070
And all it's missing
is the bottom of this.

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:32.500
But you got-- no,
you got the good part.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:33.930
MIKE: Yeah, but I'd
have to get the bottom.

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.300
FRANK: No you don't.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.130
You just put the batteries in
there and just go like that.

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:37.270
All right.
I'm taking it.

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:38.470
- Little piece of scotch tape.
- It's so cool.

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.270
It doesn't matter why you
connect with something.

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.970
What matters is that
you do connect with it.

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.200
What about the
Coke machine here?

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.030
Is this something you're
going to hold onto?

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.730
Uh, no, I'd probably sell it.

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:51.030
Does it work?

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.130
You know, I'm not sure.

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.630
MIKE: I can see it's
got the wheel in there.

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:56.770
I think it's complete.

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.000
I've got the key for it.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.670
So you've touched it up
or did you buy it like that?

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:00.730
I didn't do anything to it.

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:01.970
So this decal was on there?

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:02.970
Everything was on there?

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.500
Yeah, that's exactly
how I bought it.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.170
MIKE: I finally find
something in the museum that's

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.270
not related to toys at all.

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.200
It's an upright.

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.300
It's a cool piece.

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.700
So was it local here
where you got it?

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:13.700
Yeah.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:14.630
I actually bought
it right down here

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:15.970
in Moundsville at the sell.

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:16.970
MIKE: It's mid-50's.

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.270
It's a common machine.

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.300
The big one that everybody
wants is the model 81 that's

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:21.900
got the long door on the side.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.500
This model is not as
desirable as the 81 or the 44.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.170
But it's original paint.

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.800
There's a lot of touch up on it.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.170
But overall, it's in
pretty good condition.

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.230
In this condition, I'd
pay a couple grand for it.

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:36.470
$2,000?
- Yeah.

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:37.730
That's where I'd
need to be on it.

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.530
Frank, is it OK if I buy this?
- Yeah.

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:40.970
That's not in my
wheelhouse today.

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.470
MIKE: OK.
- Put it there, bud.

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:43.530
Appreciate you.

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.330
So for $2,000 bucks,
there's a little bit

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:46.730
of room on the back end.

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.300
I'm happy with this purchase.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.800
So the soda fountain out
front and this Coke machine

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.470
is something I remember
because I grew up in the 1950s.

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.400
So it brings back
a lot of memories.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.330
MIKE: Well, you've got--

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.270
I mean, after 16
years, you've got

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:04.970
to have seen people walk in
here and just grab their chests

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:06.030
a little bit.

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.670
And go, I had that
toy when I was a kid.

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.530
When people can have
an emotional reaction

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.530
to some of the toys
in here, that's when

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.430
I know I did something right.

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:15.370
MIKE: You really did.

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:16.400
And for the community too.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.000
I mean, everybody
that came here.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.070
A lot of people bought gas,
probably stayed at the hotels,

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:21.570
ate at the restaurants.

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:22.970
You're very civic-minded.

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:23.770
I love that.

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:24.730
Well, it was really amazing.

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:33.530
I get a little sad--
[interposing voices]

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:34.530
Hey, I understand.

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.430
Was in June--

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:37.800
June was our last month.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.030
We had people come in
from all over the country.

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.400
We had a man and a woman
from California drive in here

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.670
and she starts balling.

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:50.000
She said I had all of that
when I was a little girl.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.300
That's what makes it
all worthwhile for me.

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.330
Seeing them come in
and enjoy all this.

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.030
It's almost like the
"Field of Dreams" movie.

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.000
If you build it, they will come.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.170
And a lot of people did come.

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.300
But I've seen guys
come in and cry too.

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:09.170
MIKE: Really?

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:10.430
I'm that guy.
SELLER: Are you?

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:11.770
I'm the guy that
was so excited when

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:14.170
we got the call from Danielle.
I'm that guy.

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:15.700
[inaudible] is
number one, buddy.

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:16.400
Darn right.

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.530
In my book it is.

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:19.930
Well, the fun part of
collecting Marks stories

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:21.030
is the hunt.

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:22.830
I've had 30 years of fun.

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.830
Now I'm going to have five years
of fun selling some of them.
