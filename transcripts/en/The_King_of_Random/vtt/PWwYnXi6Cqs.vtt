00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.850
In today's video,

00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:03.400
we're going to see what happens
if we extract the ink

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.280
from 1,000 glitter gel pens.

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:12.760
[Music]

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:13.920
Guys, we've done
a couple of videos

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.600
where we took the ink
out of 1,000 ballpoint pens,

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.896
and played around that ink
to really get a look at it

00:00:18.896 --> 00:00:20.000
in a very large quantity.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.700
On one of those videos,
we had a comment asking,

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.200
what about gel pen ink?

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.800
I thought that was
a really interesting idea

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.000
because gel pen ink
is not going to be

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
the same as your typical
black ballpoint pen ink.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.450
So we got our hands
on 1,000 glitter gel pens,

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.400
and we're going to take the ink
out of all of them.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.719
The idea here is simple.

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:40.705
We're going to take the ink
out of 1,000 glitter gel pens,

00:00:40.705 --> 00:00:42.000
and really examine it.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.550
What's it look like, feel like,

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.400
what happens when we
heat it up, freeze it,

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.500
or depressurize it.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.800
So check this out.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:53.000
This box comes with
180 different colors of pens.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.500
Not only does it come
with 180 colors of pens,

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.700
it comes with a refill for each
of those 180 colors of pens.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.500
So that's 360
gel ink cartridges,

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.218
and we got three of those boxes.

00:01:04.218 --> 00:01:06.662
That's going to take us
to over 1,000 of them.

00:01:06.662 --> 00:01:08.400
We're going to drain
all of them.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.302
We're going to separate them
out a little bit by color.

00:01:10.302 --> 00:01:11.570
Then we're gonna
try mixing together.

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.800
Just really take a look
at what this stuff looks like.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.100
It should be a lot of fun.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.437
Rather than just mix all
of the ink together at first,

00:01:17.437 --> 00:01:19.200
I do want to kind
of separate it out,

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.299
so we can see some
of the cool colors in it.

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.300
However, we do have
180 different colors.

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.700
So what I'm going to do
is sort of separated them out

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.100
by their general color.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.300
So I'm going to go red, orange,
yellow, green, blue, purple,

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.360
then we have pink,

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.900
and then I'm going to have
sort of a neutrals one.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.930
That's going to be our whites,
our grays, our browns,

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:34.551
and our blacks.

00:01:34.551 --> 00:01:36.123
And that one might look
a little muddy,

00:01:36.123 --> 00:01:38.400
but they don't go too well
with any of the other colors.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.007
Now, I did some experimenting

00:01:40.007 --> 00:01:43.000
with the best ways to get
the ink out of the pen tubes.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.100
One of the first things
I tried was actually just

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.500
blowing through to see if I
can get the ink out like that,

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.400
and it does work,

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.100
but it leaves
behind enough residue

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.700
that I don't think
it's the best way.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:52.600
Same as last time,

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.000
I found that using one
of these little metal rods

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.800
as a plunger gets more ink out
than blowing into it does.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:22.080
[Music]

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.700
1,000 pens.

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.800
Actually, a little
bit over 1,000 pens

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.102
because each box
had 360 pens in it.

00:02:28.102 --> 00:02:30.800
We had three of those boxes,
that's 1,080.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.900
I might have misplaced
one or two pens.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.742
But approximately,
one thousand eighty pens.

00:02:34.742 --> 00:02:35.300
That's a lot.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.716
This is the ink you get
out of one pens worth.

00:02:37.716 --> 00:02:39.273
I've got one blue pens worth,

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.100
and one pink pens
worth right here.

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:43.140
Lovely colors.

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:49.160
[Music]

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.200
That is a lot
of colored ink right there.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.740
Holy cow.

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.360
Her neutrals is really
just sort of like IDK.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.150
I didn't know what
that was at the time.

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:59.101
With the little tubes,

00:02:59.101 --> 00:03:01.100
it's often really hard
to tell what color it is.

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:02.239
So I've definitely got some

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:04.340
in here that should have
maybe been in the yellow,

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:05.770
or the orange,
or even the purple.

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:07.570
But yeah, you just
get a little tube,

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.199
and you're like,
uh, is that brown,

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:10.123
or is that yellow?

00:03:10.123 --> 00:03:12.240
Tan and yellow
look fairly similar,

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.892
like a burgundy is just going
to look black a lot of the time.

00:03:14.892 --> 00:03:17.900
I'm not sure how I ended up with
a light purple one in there,

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:18.415
but I did.

00:03:18.415 --> 00:03:20.580
But at any rate,
that's are assorted mixes.

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:21.838
Then we've got all
these other colors.

00:03:21.838 --> 00:03:23.200
Red, orange, yellow,
green, blue, purple,

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:23.944
and a pink one

00:03:23.944 --> 00:03:26.494
because there were a lot
of pink pens in that batch.

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.840
These look amazing.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.400
All right, I've got
here are couple

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.180
of neutral miscellaneous colors.

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:33.600
I'm going to start
by stirring this all up

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.120
into seeing what color I get.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.400
I'm gonna use my finger.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:43.220
[Music]

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:44.160
There you go.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.580
Sort of a slightly
purplish gunmetal kind of color.

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.060
That looks pretty cool.

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:51.814
I thought it was going to end
up being something really ugly.

00:03:51.814 --> 00:03:52.900
And while I'm not saying

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.300
I want everything I own
to be painted this color,

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:56.780
it is kind of neat.

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:57.860
It's a little bit slippery.

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.300
This is definitely
way way thinner

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:01.620
than the other pen ink as well.

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.460
The other hand ink was
like almost gelatinous.

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:06.500
It had about the consistency
of corn syrup.

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:07.934
This is way thinner than that.

00:04:07.934 --> 00:04:09.200
It flows a lot more.

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:16.760
[Music]

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.320
The other ballpoint pen ink
bubbled really nicely.

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:20.440
In fact, that was one

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.400
of my favorite things we did was
just blowing bubbles into it,

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.200
and watching them
grow out and burst,

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.997
and this, like I said,
is a thinner liquid,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.390
so I kind of doubt
it's gonna bubble quite as much.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.060
But we're going to find out.

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:41.920
[Music]

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.880
Definitely not getting
the same type of bubbles.

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:45.040
These are much smaller,

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.760
and they don't hang
around as long.

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:53.220
[Music]

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.520
All right, so I was doing
that just to see...

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:57.240
Blowing those bubbles,

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.740
and having it pop
seems to make some

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.967
of the metallic glitter sort
of raised up out of the liquid.

00:05:01.967 --> 00:05:04.420
So now, we got
like a ring around

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:06.240
where I was blowing
the bubbles of just

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.840
what looks like the glitter,
or aluminum dust,

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.150
or whatever it is they put
in these pens to really get them

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:12.400
to shine the way they do.

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:29.400
[Music]

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:30.400
There we go.

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:43.880
[Music]

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:47.040
So we've actually put one
of our cameras, the RX100,

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:48.900
inside on top of the glass,

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.860
looking straight down
at the ink.

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:52.915
The bubble seem to be pretty
small and pop pretty easily.

00:05:52.915 --> 00:05:54.900
But once this gets down
to really low pressure,

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:57.800
it definitely does foam up
a lotm and it was coming

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.100
very very close to hitting
the lens of our camera,

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:01.600
which we don't want.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:02.640
So I'm turning the pump

00:06:02.644 --> 00:06:06.100
on and off to try and get
the air pulled out of the ink,

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:08.960
but not have it hit
the lens of our camera.

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:21.220
[Music]

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:23.280
I may be pushing it
a little too far.

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:28.080
That's sort of
our homogeneous green color.

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:28.700
It's what happens

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:31.220
when all of the different shades
of green get mixed together.

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:32.200
Moving on in
the natural progression

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:35.060
of our experimentation,
we've now got liquid nitrogen.

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:37.240
We're going to try dripping
some of our ink down

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:38.620
into liquid nitrogen.

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:45.620
[Music]

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:47.600
Formed quite nicely
into a little sphere.

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:48.660
I like that.

00:06:48.660 --> 00:07:04.360
[Music]

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:06.020
It's bubbling a lot.

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:21.700
[Music]

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:24.020
Got some cool color and swirls.

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:26.360
But then, we've also got
these clear spots that,

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:27.140
I don't know,

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:30.560
maybe the gel in the pigment
separate from each other

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:31.740
in the extreme cold.

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:33.000
I think now it's time

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.500
to see what happens
if we take this ink,

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:35.460
and heat it up.

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:36.860
That looks cool.

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:39.400
First, might just gonna take
a little bit of it,

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:40.980
see if it seems to be flammable.

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:44.300
[Music]

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:46.160
Doesn't really keep burning,

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:49.300
so it's possible that
if we get all of it really hot,

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:50.280
it will light on fire,

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:51.300
but for the most part,

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:54.260
just a little bit of flame
isn't doing too much.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.820
So, let's see what happens if we
just put this on the stove.

00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:59.040
One of the things I
definitely think will happen,

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:00.640
a lot of these viscous liquids

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:02.500
that we've tried to heating up,
they get a lot runnier,

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:04.600
and I'm curious to see
if that'll happen with this ink as well.

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:08.040
[Music]

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:10.820
Definitely getting thinner
as it heats up.

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:14.820
It's now up to almost
160 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:17.840
I see some of the silvery
bits, the glitter,

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:20.120
like joining up in some spots.

00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:21.443
See some tiny little bits,

00:08:21.443 --> 00:08:24.480
where it almost looks like
the metal has pooled together.

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:25.560
The temperature of the bottom,

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:26.900
where it's actually
in contact with the pan,

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:28.200
may easily be higher.

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:31.420
[Music]

00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:33.240
Thought that would have
a much stronger smell,

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:35.760
but it's really
quite mild still.

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:37.880
So right here from this angle,

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:39.000
you can really see what
I was talking about.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
The pigmentation and
the metallic dust

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.260
that's inside these glitter
gel pens are separating part,

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.880
and here, you can really see
all the reflections coming

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:49.680
off of the metallic portions.

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:52.400
This yellow has just
like the tiniest bit

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:54.780
of greenish brown to it,

00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:58.640
and really not a very
pleasant color in my opinion.

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:01.980
We've also definitely evaporated
some liquid out of the ink,

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:03.800
because now as
it's cooling down,

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:05.530
it's much thicker.

00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:08.500
That's almost got
into a paste consistency.

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:42.320
[Music]

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:44.160
Well, it might seem
a little bit destructive.

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:45.620
But I'm just too darn curious.

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:46.980
I got to see what happens

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:49.160
if I mix all
of the colors together.

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:51.520
Of course, we don't have
quite the same ratio

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:53.440
because our yellow
did get burned too much

00:09:53.454 --> 00:09:54.865
in the stove to stir in.

00:09:54.865 --> 00:09:57.260
We may have lost
little bits of the pink

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:58.560
when we were freezing it.

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:00.740
Some of the green might not have
scraped out of containers,

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:03.320
so it won't be 100%
perfect representation.

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:04.800
But I think it's gonne be close.

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:22.040
[Music]

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:24.240
Remarkably, similar to the color

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:26.540
we got with just blending
the neutrals together.

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:28.240
Here we have it,

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:31.040
the average color
of 1,000 pens,

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:33.320
which is really the same
as an average color

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:36.440
of 180 different colors
all mixed together.

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:38.420
It's just a lot more of it.

00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:40.280
Vicky, thank you
for your suggestion.

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:42.320
Guys, if you've got
any cool ideas for us to try,

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:44.100
let us know down
in the comments.

00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:46.160
Guys, you know that's not all,

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:47.740
we've always got more
for you to see.

00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:49.860
That box up at the top is going
to take you to our last video,

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:51.080
you should go check that out.

00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:52.060
The other box is going

00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:54.260
to show you what YouTube thinks
you should be watching next,

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:55.840
and you see this bomb
here in the middle?

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:57.178
You hit that, you'll be
subscribe to the channel.

00:10:57.180 --> 00:10:59.000
That way, you never
miss a cool video.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.300
Don't forget to ring the bell,

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:01.360
and we'll see you
in the next one.

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:01.940
Talk to you then.
