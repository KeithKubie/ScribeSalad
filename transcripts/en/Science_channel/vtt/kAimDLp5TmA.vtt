THE QUESTION HERE IS

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.801
"IS THAT WEIGHT
OR THAT DOWN PRESSURE

00:00:03.801 --> 00:00:05.467
THAT IT'S EXERTING
ON THE GROUND

00:00:05.467 --> 00:00:09.467
ENOUGH TO SET OFF ONE
OF THESE MINES?"

00:00:09.467 --> 00:00:11.100
MY PREDICTION IS THAT

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.667
THE HOVERCRAFT IS GONNA
MAKE IT JUST FINE.

00:00:13.667 --> 00:00:15.868
EVEN THOUGH IT WEIGHS,
FULLY LOADED, WITH A PERSON,

00:00:15.868 --> 00:00:18.334
OVER 600 POUNDS,
I DON'T SEE IT EXERTING

00:00:18.334 --> 00:00:21.234
300 POUNDS DOWN
ON ITS UNDERSKIRT.

00:00:21.234 --> 00:00:23.567
IT'S JUST NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

WITH JAMIE IN THE HOTSEAT

AND A HIGH-TECH MINEFIELD
RIGGED AND READY TO BLOW,

00:00:31.934 --> 00:00:33.834

00:00:33.834 --> 00:00:36.968

WE DROVE ACROSS A MINEFIELD

THOSE ARE POINT SOURCES
OF PRESSURE.
