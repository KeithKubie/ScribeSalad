00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.590
The radius at pi come together in
the equation for the area of a circle.

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:08.770
Area is a measure of how much
space is inside of a circle.

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:12.100
So, ll of this dark green parted here.

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:18.750
The relationship between area radius and
pie is a equals Pie r squared.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.070
Remember A is for area.

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:22.613
R is for radius.

00:00:22.613 --> 00:00:27.844
So if we had a circle with radius = 2,

00:00:27.844 --> 00:00:32.584
the area would be equal to 3.14

00:00:32.584 --> 00:00:37.984
times 2 squared which = 12.56.

00:00:37.984 --> 00:00:42.980
So what is the area of
a circle with a radius of 6?

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:44.660
Enter your answer here.
