00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.402
- Greetings to you,

00:00:02.435 --> 00:00:04.570
children of the world.

00:00:04.603 --> 00:00:06.272
It is I, Duncan Trussell,

00:00:06.305 --> 00:00:08.207
and tonight on "Drunk History,"

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.111
we're gonna talk about LSD
and dolphins.

00:00:12.144 --> 00:00:13.146
- Cheers.

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:14.747 line:92%
- Cheers.

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.985
<i> So in 1961, Dr. John Lilly
 published an amazing book</i>

00:00:19.018 --> 00:00:20.753
<i> called "Man and Dolphin."</i>

00:00:20.786 --> 00:00:26.859
<i> He wrote, wow,
 these dolphins are smart.</i>

00:00:26.892 --> 00:00:28.728
<i> They're not like
 what we thought.</i>

00:00:28.761 --> 00:00:30.963
<i> They're not just sea rats.</i>

00:00:30.996 --> 00:00:32.565
<i> They're talking to each other.</i>

00:00:32.598 --> 00:00:34.967
<i> They're social,
 they're advanced,</i>

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.769
<i> and we don't even know it yet,</i>

00:00:36.802 --> 00:00:39.639
<i> but I bet we could
 talk to these sweeties.</i>

00:00:39.672 --> 00:00:41.240
So yeah, there was
a big dolphin boom.

00:00:41.273 --> 00:00:43.042
Everybody's reading
Lilly's book,

00:00:43.075 --> 00:00:46.446 line:0%
and Carl Satan--Carl--

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:48.714
Carl Satan is a cool name.

00:00:48.747 --> 00:00:51.317
Carl Satan is so much cooler
than Marilyn Manson.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:52.752
- [laughs]

00:00:52.785 --> 00:00:55.088
- I so hope someone
watching this

00:00:55.121 --> 00:00:57.423
starts a [bleep] bad-ass band

00:00:57.456 --> 00:01:00.293
and renames themselves
Carl Satan.

00:01:00.326 --> 00:01:02.929 line:0%
<i> All right, Carl Sagan's
 reading this book,</i>

00:01:02.962 --> 00:01:04.964 line:0%
<i> and he's like, whoa.</i>

00:01:04.997 --> 00:01:08.935
<i> If dolphins
 can [bleep] talk,</i>

00:01:08.968 --> 00:01:11.270
<i> what the [bleep], man?</i>

00:01:11.303 --> 00:01:13.406
<i> This book is blowing my mind.</i>

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.408
<i> So Sagan calls a meeting.</i>

00:01:15.441 --> 00:01:17.743
<i> SETI, the search for
 extraterrestrial intelligence,</i>

00:01:17.776 --> 00:01:20.480
<i> their members before
 it even existed are like,</i>

00:01:20.513 --> 00:01:23.049
<i> shit, we all wanted to talk
 to these [bleep] aliens.</i>

00:01:23.082 --> 00:01:24.450
<i> And they're all like,</i>

00:01:24.483 --> 00:01:26.018
<i> dolphins are these
 [bleep] mammals, man,</i>

00:01:26.051 --> 00:01:28.121
<i> and they live in the sea,
 they can talk.</i>

00:01:28.154 --> 00:01:29.989
<i> If we can figure out
 how to talk to them,</i>

00:01:30.022 --> 00:01:33.793
<i> maybe we can figure out
 how to talk to aliens.</i>

00:01:33.826 --> 00:01:36.729
<i> NASA's like, [bleep] man,
 let's do this shit.</i>

00:01:36.762 --> 00:01:39.432
<i> NASA gives John Lilly
 a shit-ton of money.</i>

00:01:39.465 --> 00:01:42.335 line:0%
<i> So John Lilly starts
 a dolphin laboratory</i>

00:01:42.368 --> 00:01:45.238 line:0%
<i> in St. Thomas
 in the Caribbean in 1963.</i>

00:01:45.271 --> 00:01:46.706 line:0%
<i> It's called
 the Communicating--</i>

00:01:46.739 --> 00:01:50.243
<i> Communications Research
 Institute, CRI.</i>

00:01:50.276 --> 00:01:53.579
So somehow John Lilly
gets three dolphins.

00:01:53.612 --> 00:01:55.481
<i> And he's looking at them,
 he's like, all right,</i>

00:01:55.514 --> 00:01:57.583
<i> I'm gonna name you Pamela.</i>

00:01:57.616 --> 00:02:00.052
<i> I'm gonna call you Sissy.</i>

00:02:00.085 --> 00:02:01.921
<i> And I'm gonna call you Peter,</i>

00:02:01.954 --> 00:02:05.625
<i> and we're gonna teach you
 how to speak English.</i>

00:02:05.658 --> 00:02:07.894 line:0%
<i> So someone who works there,</i>

00:02:07.927 --> 00:02:10.263 line:0%
<i> her name's
 Margaret Howe Lovatt,</i>

00:02:10.296 --> 00:02:12.231
<i> he says to her, listen,
 I wanna give you Peter.</i>

00:02:12.264 --> 00:02:13.933
<i> You teach Peter how to talk.</i>

00:02:13.966 --> 00:02:17.737
<i> Margaret says, I am going
 to teach you English.</i>

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.007
<i> He's like--
 [imitates dolphin noises]</i>

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.176
<i> She'd be like,
 my name is Margaret.</i>

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.511
And he'd be like--
[imitates dolphin noises]

00:02:25.544 --> 00:02:27.079
And like--
- Doesn't sound like her name.

00:02:27.112 --> 00:02:29.649
- No, it's a [bleep] dolphin.
Give him a break.

00:02:29.682 --> 00:02:32.585
Imagine if somebody took you

00:02:32.618 --> 00:02:35.354
out of the Earth
onto an alien spaceship

00:02:35.387 --> 00:02:38.491
and they're like, hey, listen,
talk with your ass.

00:02:38.524 --> 00:02:40.960
- [laughs]
- That's Peter's situation.

00:02:40.993 --> 00:02:43.095
<i> So--so she wanted
 to be around</i>

00:02:43.128 --> 00:02:44.463
<i> the dolphin all the time.</i>

00:02:44.496 --> 00:02:46.566
<i> Her bed is next
 to the dolphin aquarium.</i>

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:50.136
<i> She built her desk in
 a platform above the tank.</i>

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:52.838
She basically moves
into Peter's apartment.

00:02:52.871 --> 00:02:56.175
So Peter seems to be learning,

00:02:56.208 --> 00:02:58.144
<i> and Lilly's like, shit man,</i>

00:02:58.177 --> 00:03:00.346
<i> Margaret, I think you and
 Peter are hitting it off.</i>

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:02.215
<i> But here's the problem.</i>

00:03:02.248 --> 00:03:05.117
Dolphins are sexual creatures.
- Uh-oh.

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.820
<i> - So it's like rubbing
 up against her,</i>

00:03:07.853 --> 00:03:09.522
<i> it's humping her leg.</i>

00:03:09.555 --> 00:03:11.457
<i> He's like, look,
 look what's happening to me.</i>

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.659
<i> And--and she's like, oh, wow.</i>

00:03:13.692 --> 00:03:15.494
<i> Like, he needs to [bleep].</i>

00:03:15.527 --> 00:03:17.363
<i> So when Peter
 would get horny,</i>

00:03:17.396 --> 00:03:19.065
<i> they would, like,
 lift him out of the tank</i>

00:03:19.098 --> 00:03:21.367
<i> and put him in the tank
 with the two other girls,</i>

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.835
<i> dolphins.</i>

00:03:22.868 --> 00:03:26.005
<i> - Nice.</i>

00:03:26.038 --> 00:03:27.673
- And sure as shit,

00:03:27.706 --> 00:03:32.144
<i> afterwards he started
 learning English better.</i>

00:03:32.177 --> 00:03:34.780
<i> Margaret's like, talk, talk,
 talk, talk, talk time.</i>

00:03:34.813 --> 00:03:36.749
<i> We can talk.
 Now you talk.</i>

00:03:36.782 --> 00:03:38.484
<i> Peter's like, [bleep],
 I think they want me</i>

00:03:38.517 --> 00:03:40.486
<i> to say their monkey talk.</i>

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:44.323
[imitates dolphin chattering]

00:03:44.356 --> 00:03:45.891
<i> But I'm horny.</i>

00:03:45.924 --> 00:03:48.561
<i> She's like, goddamn it.
 Here we go again.</i>

00:03:48.594 --> 00:03:50.496
<i> But moving a dolphin sucks.</i>

00:03:50.529 --> 00:03:52.732
<i> And she's like, I didn't know
 I was gonna become</i>

00:03:52.765 --> 00:03:56.269
<i> a [bleep] Uber
 for dolphin [bleep].</i>

00:03:56.302 --> 00:03:59.672
And at some point--
[laughter]

00:03:59.705 --> 00:04:01.774
At some point she's like,

00:04:01.807 --> 00:04:03.509
<i> listen, guys, listen,
 we can't do this.</i>

00:04:03.542 --> 00:04:04.944
<i> We don't have the time.</i>

00:04:04.977 --> 00:04:07.046
<i> I'll jerk him off.
 What's the big deal?</i>

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:09.115
<i> Margaret started
 jerking Peter off</i>

00:04:09.148 --> 00:04:10.650
<i> in between lessons.</i>

00:04:10.683 --> 00:04:13.786
- Do you think the handjob
had a special allure for him?

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:15.521
'Cause dolphins
don't have hands.

00:04:15.554 --> 00:04:17.056
- I think as a dolphin

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:19.925
Peter was not stuck
on hands or no hands.

00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:22.328
<i> He was just like,
 I'm from the ocean.</i>

00:04:22.361 --> 00:04:25.131
<i> You, I don't know
 what the [bleep] you're from.</i>

00:04:25.164 --> 00:04:27.199
<i> You're some
 kind of monkey thing.</i>

00:04:27.232 --> 00:04:29.669
<i> I think I know what will
 make you happy though.</i>

00:04:29.702 --> 00:04:31.537
<i> That's making me [bleep].</i>

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:33.773
<i> [laughter]</i>

00:04:35.174 --> 00:04:36.976
- My career is over.
- What?

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:38.778
- My career is over, tonight.

00:04:38.811 --> 00:04:41.814
[laughter]

00:04:41.847 --> 00:04:43.783
So where'd the drugs
get into the story?

00:04:43.816 --> 00:04:47.153
- Okay, so John Lilly's
at a party.

00:04:47.186 --> 00:04:49.655
<i> He meets the wife
 of the producer of "Flipper,"</i>

00:04:49.688 --> 00:04:51.257
<i> who gives him LSD.</i>

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:52.792
<i> Everyone's on acid.</i>

00:04:52.825 --> 00:04:54.493
<i> John Lilly gets the idea,</i>

00:04:54.526 --> 00:04:57.697
<i> if we start giving acid
 to dolphins,</i>

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:00.466
<i> I bet they'll talk to us.</i>

00:05:00.499 --> 00:05:02.134
<i> [loud sigh]</i>

00:05:02.167 --> 00:05:04.437
<i> - You all right?
 - I'm fine, man.</i>

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:08.107
<i> - You spinning?
 - I'm not spinning.</i>

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:09.909
<i> Yet.</i>

00:05:09.942 --> 00:05:11.210
I hate spinning.
Is there--

00:05:11.243 --> 00:05:13.713
Do you have a solution
to spinning, Doctor?

00:05:13.746 --> 00:05:14.947
- Vomiting.

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:17.350
- God, God, that's so evil.

00:05:17.383 --> 00:05:19.485
So [bleep] up.

00:05:19.518 --> 00:05:20.953
There's nothing else?

00:05:20.986 --> 00:05:23.756
- Not drinking so much.

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:24.790
- Goddamn it.

00:05:24.823 --> 00:05:26.625
- So the lab, so the LSD.

00:05:26.658 --> 00:05:29.562
- [sighs] All right.

00:05:29.595 --> 00:05:32.164
<i> One of John Lilly's dolphins
 was traumatized.</i>

00:05:32.197 --> 00:05:33.966
<i> It'd been hit by a spear gun,</i>

00:05:33.999 --> 00:05:35.468
<i> and it was afraid of humans.</i>

00:05:35.501 --> 00:05:37.570
He goes in the laboratory
with a bunch of acid.

00:05:37.603 --> 00:05:40.072
<i> This'll be great.
 We can talk to the dolphins!</i>

00:05:40.105 --> 00:05:43.209
<i> Let's talk to dolphins!</i>

00:05:43.242 --> 00:05:45.845
<i> He gives the dolphin acid.</i>

00:05:45.878 --> 00:05:49.014
<i> The dolphin that was
 formerly scared of humans</i>

00:05:49.047 --> 00:05:52.017
<i> swims up to him
 and looks him in the eye.</i>

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:53.386
<i> There's a moment
 where it's like,</i>

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:55.654
<i> wait, maybe this isn't
 about language.</i>

00:05:55.687 --> 00:05:57.823
<i> Maybe it's something
 deeper than language.</i>

00:05:57.856 --> 00:06:02.094
<i> And John Lilly realized,
 wow, this works.</i>

00:06:02.127 --> 00:06:03.562
- [bleep] this blowhole
communication.

00:06:03.595 --> 00:06:06.132
This is something bigger.
- Exactly!

00:06:06.165 --> 00:06:07.933
It's not just the guttural
sound you make

00:06:07.966 --> 00:06:10.469
out of your [bleep]
hamburger tube.

00:06:10.502 --> 00:06:12.805
[laughter]

00:06:15.808 --> 00:06:19.845
<i> So John Lilly starts
 giving the dolphins acid.</i>

00:06:19.878 --> 00:06:21.747
<i> Margaret is like,
 hey, John,</i>

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:23.849
<i> do you mind not injecting
 Peter with acid?</i>

00:06:23.882 --> 00:06:25.951
<i> That'd be awesome.
 I don't think he wants acid.</i>

00:06:25.984 --> 00:06:27.386
<i> I don't want you
 to give it to him.</i>

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:28.687
<i> Margaret's like,
 I love this dolphin.</i>

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.189
<i> I don't know.</i>

00:06:30.222 --> 00:06:32.458
<i> And Lilly's like, no,
 I'm gonna give Peter acid.</i>

00:06:32.491 --> 00:06:34.927
<i> It makes them--it seems
 to make them a little more,</i>

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:36.695
<i> like, communicative,
 they're a little--</i>

00:06:36.728 --> 00:06:38.464
<i> it seems to excite them
 in some way.</i>

00:06:38.497 --> 00:06:41.901
<i> And he gave it acid.</i>

00:06:41.934 --> 00:06:46.238
<i> So John Lilly is on acid.</i>

00:06:46.271 --> 00:06:48.007
<i> So they're both tripping.</i>

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.109
<i> [psychedelic music]</i>

00:06:50.142 --> 00:06:54.046
So, ugh...

00:06:54.079 --> 00:06:56.482
<i> Eventually
 "Hustler" catches wind</i>

00:06:56.515 --> 00:06:59.185
<i> of the fact that Margaret is,
 like, jerking off dolphins</i>

00:06:59.218 --> 00:07:00.853
<i> and writes an article.</i>

00:07:00.886 --> 00:07:02.488
<i> They made it like
 "Hustler" style.</i>

00:07:02.521 --> 00:07:04.690
<i> - Yeah, yeah.
 - Someone at NASA opens it up</i>

00:07:04.723 --> 00:07:06.559
<i> and they're like,
 what the [bleep]?</i>

00:07:06.592 --> 00:07:08.561
<i> I paid a million dollars
 to that asshole,</i>

00:07:08.594 --> 00:07:11.230
<i> and they're out there
 [bleep] the dolphins.</i>

00:07:11.263 --> 00:07:14.300
<i> And so Carl Sagan
 comes in one day,</i>

00:07:14.333 --> 00:07:17.369
<i> and he's like,
 uh, I'm Carl Sagan,</i>

00:07:17.402 --> 00:07:20.206
<i> and I'm a very respected
 scientist.</i>

00:07:20.239 --> 00:07:23.175
<i> I love space.
 You know that.</i>

00:07:23.208 --> 00:07:24.977
<i> I think space is amazing,</i>

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:27.246
<i> but there's a couple of things
 I think are weird</i>

00:07:27.279 --> 00:07:29.415
<i> that are now happening
 in the universe.</i>

00:07:29.448 --> 00:07:32.518
<i> Number one,
 jerking off dolphins.</i>

00:07:32.551 --> 00:07:35.120
<i> And number two,
 giving them acid.</i>

00:07:35.153 --> 00:07:36.956
<i> And you know what, John?</i>

00:07:36.989 --> 00:07:39.892
<i> When I said let's talk
 to [bleep] dolphins,</i>

00:07:39.925 --> 00:07:42.928
<i> I didn't mean let's teach them
 to speak English.</i>

00:07:42.961 --> 00:07:45.431
<i> Let's learn their language!</i>

00:07:45.464 --> 00:07:50.135
<i> You don't go to Japan
 and kidnap a Japanese man</i>

00:07:50.168 --> 00:07:54.540
<i> and start jerking him off
 and giving him [bleep] acid</i>

00:07:54.573 --> 00:07:57.543
<i> and then ask him
 to learn English!</i>

00:07:57.576 --> 00:07:59.678
<i> John, I'm sorry, I'm angry,</i>

00:07:59.711 --> 00:08:02.648
<i> but really just think about it
 from my perspective, man.</i>

00:08:02.681 --> 00:08:05.117
<i> The next time
 I go to [bleep] NASA,</i>

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:07.486
<i> they're gonna be like,
 oh yeah, sure, Carl.</i>

00:08:07.519 --> 00:08:11.223
<i> Who you gonna jerk off
 in this experiment, aliens?</i>

00:08:11.256 --> 00:08:14.460
<i> An owl? A partridge?
 What's it gonna be, Carl?</i>

00:08:14.493 --> 00:08:16.028
<i> Oh yeah, sure,
 we'll give you money.</i>

00:08:16.061 --> 00:08:17.930
<i> Get the [bleep] outta here!</i>

00:08:17.963 --> 00:08:20.299
[laughter]

00:08:20.332 --> 00:08:25.538
<i> So the lab shuts down, 1966.</i>

00:08:25.571 --> 00:08:27.606
<i> Peter went
 to another laboratory.</i>

00:08:27.639 --> 00:08:29.642
<i> It wasn't a lab
 like the one he was at.</i>

00:08:29.675 --> 00:08:31.944
<i> This was just a [bleep] up
 basic, shitty,</i>

00:08:31.977 --> 00:08:33.612
<i> goddamn dolphin lab.</i>

00:08:33.645 --> 00:08:35.180
Peter's heart was broken.

00:08:35.213 --> 00:08:36.782
<i> He loved Margaret.</i>

00:08:36.815 --> 00:08:40.753
<i> So Peter swims to the bottom
 of the aquarium,</i>

00:08:40.786 --> 00:08:42.087
and he dies.

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:43.422
He drowns himself.

00:08:43.455 --> 00:08:45.558
- Dolphins can choose
not to breathe.

00:08:45.591 --> 00:08:47.459
- Yeah, Peter, especially.

00:08:47.492 --> 00:08:50.329
<i> And Margaret's heart
 was broken.</i>

00:08:50.362 --> 00:08:54.833
<i> She was so--she was
 really hurt by that.</i>

00:08:54.866 --> 00:08:56.635
This is like the important
point, man.

00:08:56.668 --> 00:08:57.803
- Hmm?

00:08:57.836 --> 00:08:59.171
<i> - John Lilly's work</i>

00:08:59.204 --> 00:09:01.407
<i> led to a world-wide
 recognition</i>

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:05.611
<i> of dolphins and whales
 as intelligent life forms.</i>

00:09:05.644 --> 00:09:07.613
<i> And thanks to his work,
 they passed</i>

00:09:07.646 --> 00:09:09.949
<i> the Marine Mammal
 Protection Act,</i>

00:09:09.982 --> 00:09:13.018
<i> which kept dolphins
 and whales safe.</i>

00:09:13.051 --> 00:09:16.755
- In spite of the peculiar
twists and turns of this story,

00:09:16.788 --> 00:09:18.557
why was this important history?

00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:21.193
- I think Peter taught us that
no matter how bad it seems,

00:09:21.226 --> 00:09:23.596
like, you could
make it better.

00:09:23.629 --> 00:09:26.365
Right, like, he's like,
if you believe in yourself,

00:09:26.398 --> 00:09:28.467
<i> if you truly believe
 in yourself,</i>

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:29.969
<i> you can get
 a monkey descendant</i>

00:09:30.002 --> 00:09:31.403
<i> to make you [bleep].</i>

00:09:31.436 --> 00:09:33.239
[laughter]

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:38.511
Oh, God, I wish I was born
in the '60s.
