00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:16.070
On September 25, 1926, the Ford Motor Company
instituted a five-day, 40-hour work week for

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.640
its factory employees.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.140
While Ford wasn’t the first to do this,
they were arguably one of the most influential.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.390
This action, at least initially, did not win
Ford many friends among his fellow business

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.550
owners, some of whom believed giving the working
man any time off just encouraged them to indulge

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.170
in drink even more than they already did.

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.309
(To be fair, that was a real problem around
this era.

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.750
It was not from nothing that excessive drink
was blamed for many of society’s woes at

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.760
the time, ultimately inspiring Prohibition,
which even a very large percentage of said

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.860
drinkers supported in the beginning.

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:54.809
But, of course, if you had to work 14-16 hour
days, 6 days per week from your very early

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.230
teen years on- for reference in 1890 the average
work week in the United States for a blue-collar

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.729
factory worker was 90-100 hours- you might
be driven to drink excessively too.

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:00.729
;-))

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:04.910
Beyond this, many competing employers were
still miffed at Ford for raising his (male)

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:11.920
workers’ salaries up to five dollars per
day (about $116 today) back in 1914, double

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.780
the former going rate, and around the same
time cutting the typical work week down to

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.110
48 hours at his factories.

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:19.110
(Women had to wait until 1916 to command the
same wage.)

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.659
But since Ford was one the world’s largest
manufacturers, most in the industry were compelled

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:25.460
for various reasons to follow their example,
like it or not.

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.640
Ford stated in his company’s newsletter,

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.450
Just as the eight-hour day opened our way
to prosperity in America, so the five-day

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.700
work week will open our way to still greater
prosperity … It is high time to rid ourselves

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.520
of the notion that leisure for workmen is
either lost time or a class privilege.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.520
Of course, Ford wasn’t just doing this out
of the goodness of his heart.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.039
He understood that a five-day work week with
“eight hours labour, eight hours recreation,

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:57.479
eight hours rest” would encourage working
people to vacation on weekends, shop on Saturdays,

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.620
and have ample free time to fill during their
daily 8 hour recreation time.

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:09.289
(See: Why a Typical Work Day is Eight Hours
Long) People with more leisure time required

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.400
more clothing, ate a greater variety of food
and, of course, were far more likely to be

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.920
in the market to buy an automobile to travel
around in.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.340
Workers who were paid more also were more
likely to be able to afford such an automobile.

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.310
Beyond benefiting sales as other companies
followed suit, he had also observed that happy

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:32.400
workers (both in their home and work life)
meant better and more efficient workers.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:38.760
Now, Ford expected his workers to produce
in those shorter working hours, but with the

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.790
higher pay and weekends off, there were very
few complaints from any of his employees.

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.920
They were happy to put the pedal to the metal
Monday through Friday for their excellent

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.970
salary and five-day, 40 hour work week.

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.489
As Ford had thought, after instituting these
changes, productivity skyrocketed, meaning

00:02:55.489 --> 00:03:00.550
he was getting more results from significantly
fewer work hours and company loyalty and pride

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.610
among Ford employees was equally boosted.

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.880
Beyond low-skilled laborers banging down the
doors to get work at Ford, he also now had

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.180
the luxury of having the top talent in each
of the high-skilled fields he needed workers

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:09.180
for applying in droves.

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.459
Needless to say, manufacturers all over the
world would soon follow Ford’s example,

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:16.180
which played right into his hands.

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.129
Edsel Ford, Henry’s son and then company
president, was quoted in March of 1922 in

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:24.970
the New York Times as saying of all this,
“Every man needs more than one day a week

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.959
for rest and recreation….The Ford Company
always has sought to promote [an] ideal home

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:31.670
life for its employees.

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.909
We believe that in order to live properly
every man should have more time to spend with

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:36.909
his family.”

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:39.190
Ford himself laid it all out in black and
white:

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.580
The harder we crowd business for time, the
more efficient it becomes.

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.500
The more well-paid leisure workmen get, the
greater become their wants.

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.670
These wants soon become needs.

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.730
Well-managed business pays high wages and
sells at low prices.

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:58.330
Its workmen have the leisure to enjoy life
and the wherewithal with which to finance

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:59.330
that enjoyment.

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:05.740
In the early 19th century in Britain, a series
of “Factories Acts” were passed meant

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:09.909
to help improve working conditions for workers,
particularly for children.

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:14.590
One of the first of these was in 1802 and
stipulated children under the age of 9 were

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.109
not to be allowed to work and, rather, must
attend school.

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:24.140
Further, children from the ages of 9-13 were
only allowed to work eight hours per day and

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:28.740
children from 14-18 could only work a maximum
of 12 hours per day.

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:34.040
Unfortunately, this law was largely ignored
and almost never enforced in any way.

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.830
Further, even when it rarely was enforced,
the fines were small enough that it was more

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:43.650
profitable for factory owners to break this
law and pay the fine, than to follow it.

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:48.440
The act also did nothing for adults except
require that factories be well ventilated,

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:53.010
though it did not stipulate what defines “well
ventilated”, so factory owners could easily

00:04:53.010 --> 00:05:11.150
ignore this part of the act as well.
