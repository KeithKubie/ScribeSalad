00:00:09.491 --> 00:00:12.526
What gives the trumpet its clarion ring

00:00:12.526 --> 00:00:17.177
and the tuba its gut-shaking 
"omm pah pah?"

00:00:17.177 --> 00:00:21.317
And what makes the trombone so jazzy?

00:00:21.317 --> 00:00:24.978
The answer lies not in the brass
these instruments are made of,

00:00:24.978 --> 00:00:26.750
but in the journey air takes

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.895
from the musician's lungs
to the instrument's bell.

00:00:30.895 --> 00:00:35.901
Like any sound, music consists
of vibrations traveling through air.

00:00:35.901 --> 00:00:40.268
Instruments are classified based on
how those vibrations are produced.

00:00:40.268 --> 00:00:42.225
Percussion instruments are struck.

00:00:42.225 --> 00:00:45.244
String instruments are plucked or bowed.

00:00:45.244 --> 00:00:49.525
Woodwinds have air blown 
against a reed or sharp edge.

00:00:49.525 --> 00:00:51.152
For brass instruments, however,

00:00:51.152 --> 00:00:55.402
the vibration come directly 
from the musician's mouth.

00:00:55.402 --> 00:01:00.632
One of the first things a brass player
must learn is to breathe in deeply,

00:01:00.632 --> 00:01:05.970
until every possible particle of air
is crammed into the lungs.

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.402
Once all that air is inside,
it must come out through the mouth,

00:01:09.402 --> 00:01:12.554
but there, an internal battle takes place

00:01:12.554 --> 00:01:16.988
as the musician simultaneously tries
to hold their lips firmly closed

00:01:16.988 --> 00:01:21.163
while blowing enough air 
to force them open.

00:01:21.163 --> 00:01:24.213
The escaping air meets resistance
from the lip muscles,

00:01:24.213 --> 00:01:27.075
forms an opening called the aperture

00:01:27.075 --> 00:01:32.207
and creates the vibration 
that brass players call "the buzz."

00:01:32.207 --> 00:01:35.164
When a mouthpiece is held up
to those vibrating lips,

00:01:35.164 --> 00:01:37.742
it slightly refines the buzz,

00:01:37.742 --> 00:01:41.036
amplifying the vibration 
at certain frequencies.

00:01:41.036 --> 00:01:42.747
But things get really interesting

00:01:42.747 --> 00:01:46.481
depending on what instrument
is attached to that mouthpiece.

00:01:46.481 --> 00:01:49.495
A brass instrument's body 
is essentially a tube

00:01:49.495 --> 00:01:52.609
that resonates with the air 
column blowing through it.

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:54.993
The way that sound waves
travel through this column

00:01:54.993 --> 00:01:59.774
forms a limited pattern of pitches
known as the harmonic series,

00:01:59.774 --> 00:02:02.764
with notes spaced far apart
at the lower end,

00:02:02.764 --> 00:02:06.482
but coming closer together
as the pitch increases.

00:02:06.482 --> 00:02:08.668
The musician can alter 
the pitch of the note

00:02:08.668 --> 00:02:14.674
through slight contractions of the lips
and alterations to air volume and speed.

00:02:14.674 --> 00:02:18.403
Slower, warm sighing air 
produces lower pitches,

00:02:18.403 --> 00:02:23.986
and faster, cool, flowing air
produces higher pitches in the series.

00:02:23.986 --> 00:02:28.174
But any single harmonic series has gaps
where pitches are missing

00:02:28.174 --> 00:02:30.447
and the versatility of brass instruments

00:02:30.447 --> 00:02:34.367
lies in their ability to switch 
between multiple series.

00:02:34.367 --> 00:02:37.353
On instruments like the trumpet,
valves can be lowered

00:02:37.353 --> 00:02:41.082
to increase the length of tubing 
the air travels through,

00:02:41.082 --> 00:02:46.219
while on a trombone, 
this is done by extending its slide.

00:02:46.219 --> 00:02:49.215
Lengthening the tube stretches
the vibrating air column,

00:02:49.215 --> 00:02:53.900
reducing the frequency of vibrations
and resulting in a lower pitch.

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.854
This is why the tuba, 
the largest brass instrument,

00:02:56.854 --> 00:03:00.934
is also the one capable of playing
the lowest notes.

00:03:00.934 --> 00:03:04.827
So changing the instrument length
shifts its harmonic series,

00:03:04.827 --> 00:03:08.135
while slight variations of the air flow
and the player's lips

00:03:08.135 --> 00:03:10.964
produce the different notes within it.

00:03:10.964 --> 00:03:16.357
And those notes finally emerge through
the flared bell opening at the end.

00:03:16.357 --> 00:03:20.184
What started as a deep breath
and a vibrating buzz on the lips

00:03:20.184 --> 00:03:24.325
has now been transformed
into a bold and brassy tune.

00:03:24.325 --> 00:03:27.957
The musician's skillful manipulation
of every part of the process

00:03:27.957 --> 00:03:29.205
from lungs,

00:03:29.205 --> 00:03:30.266
to lips,

00:03:30.266 --> 00:03:31.432
to the mouthpiece,

00:03:31.432 --> 00:03:35.157
to the instrument itself creates
an amazing palette of pitches

00:03:35.157 --> 00:03:38.908
that can be heard in musical genres
across the globe.

00:03:38.908 --> 00:03:41.684
By harnessing the power 
of natural resonance

00:03:41.684 --> 00:03:44.034
in a flexible and controllable way,

00:03:44.034 --> 00:03:48.371
brass instruments are great examples
of the fusion of human creativity

00:03:48.371 --> 00:03:51.098
with the physics of our world.
