00:00:00.546 --> 00:00:02.670
So we've been going through
all of the other things

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:05.370
that we were assuming are
held constant in order

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.760
to be moving along
one demand curve.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.070
And now let's list a few other.

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:12.260
And before I do any more of
them, let's talk about the ones

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:13.300
we already talked about.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.502
So one, we said that one of
the things we held constant--

00:00:16.502 --> 00:00:17.460
let me write this down.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.440
So held constant.

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.610
One of the things that we
held constant to move along

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:28.460
one demand curve for the
demand itself to not shift,

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.935
for the curve to not shift,
is price of related goods.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.880
The other thing we assumed
that's being held constant

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.150
is price expectations
for our good.

00:00:45.657 --> 00:00:48.240
And now we'll list a couple of
them that are fairly intuitive,

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.781
but you'll see in
the next few videos

00:00:49.781 --> 00:00:52.660
that there are often
special cases even to this.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.010
So the other thing
that we've been holding

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.470
constant to stay on one
demand curve is income.

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.330
And this one is
fairly intuitive.

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.120
What happens if everyone's
income were to increase?

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.849
And in real terms, it
were to actually increase.

00:01:07.849 --> 00:01:10.390
Well then, all of a sudden, they
have more disposable income,

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.880
maybe to spend on
something like e-books.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.870
And so for any
given price point,

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:16.210
the demand would increase.

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:17.840
And so it would
increase the demand.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.250
And once again, when we talk
about increasing demand,

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.920
we're talking about
shifting the entire curve.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.970
We're not talking about a
particular quantity of demand.

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:31.530
So income goes up, then
it increases demand.

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:32.450
Demand goes up.

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.980
And remember, when we're talking
about when demand goes up,

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.396
we're talking about the whole
curve shifting to the right.

00:01:37.396 --> 00:01:40.130
At any given price
point, we are going

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.540
to have a larger
quantity demanded.

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.560
So the whole curve, this whole
demand schedule would change.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.007
And likewise if income went
down, demand would go down.

00:01:48.007 --> 00:01:50.340
And we're going to see in a
future video-- it's actually

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.360
quite interesting-- that's
not always the case.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.520
This is only true
for normal goods.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.340
And in a future video we'll
see goods called inferior goods

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.520
where this is not
necessarily the case.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.720
Or by definition for an inferior
good, it would not be the case.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.240
Now the other ones that
are somewhat intuitive

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:18.200
are population-- once again,
if population goes up,

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.640
obviously, at any
given price point,

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:21.850
more people will want it.

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.850
So it would shift the
demand curve to the right,

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.340
or it would increase demand.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.540
If population were
to go down, it

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.280
would decrease
demand, which means

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.100
shifting the whole
curve to the left.

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.350
And then the last one we'll
talk about-- and remember,

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.475
we're holding all of these
things constant in order

00:02:36.475 --> 00:02:37.610
for demand not to change.

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.710
The last thing is
just preferences.

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:43.200
We're assuming that people's
tastes and preferences don't

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.020
change while we move along
a specific demand curve.

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.850
If preferences actually change,
then it will change the curve.

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:56.530
So for example, if all of a
sudden, the author of the book

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.970
is on some very popular talk
show that tells everyone

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.590
that this is the best book
that was ever written,

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.890
then preferences
would go up, and that

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:07.710
would increase the total demand.

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:09.910
At any given price
point, more people

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.310
will be willing to buy the book.

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.690
If, on the other hand,
on that same talk show,

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.160
it turns out that they do an
expose on the author having

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.830
this sordid past, and the author
plagiarized the whole book,

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:22.890
then the demand will go down.

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.950
The entire curve, regardless of
the price point-- at any given

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:32.650
price point, the quantity
demanded will actually go down.
