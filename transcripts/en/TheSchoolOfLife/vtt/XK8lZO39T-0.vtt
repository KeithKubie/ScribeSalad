00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:14.260
Gustave Flaubert was a great French 19th century novelist who deserves our love and sympathy

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.360
as much for what he wrote as who he was.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.760
We can admire him for four reasons at least.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:28.020
Flaubert wrote arguably the single greatest tragic novel ever written, Madame Bovary,

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.060
which he worked on for five years and published in 1857.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:37.380
The point of a tragedy is to allow us to experience a degree of sympathy for others' failures

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.220
that's so much greater than what we ordinarily feel.

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.540
It shakes us from our customary moralism and brittle superiority.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:49.120
It helps us empathize in the way the modern media usually prevents.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.960
In the summer of 1848, a terse item appeared in many newspapers across Normandy.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:00.400
A 27-year-old woman named Delphine Delamare, living in Ry, just outside Rouen,

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.500
had become dissatisfied with the routines of married life.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.200
She'd run up huge debts on superfluous clothes and household goods

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.240
and she'd committed suicide under emotional and financial pressure.

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.180
Madame Delamare was leaving behind a young daughter and a distraught husband.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:23.120
One of those reading the newspaper was the 27-year-old aspiring novelist Gustave Flaubert

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:28.480
who grew so fascinated by the story that he used it to provide him with the exact plot structure

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.600
for his eventual novel Madame Bovary.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.960
One of the things that happened when Madame Delamare, the adulteress from Ry, turned into

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.640
Madame Bovary, the adulteress from the fictional town of Yonville,

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.180
was that her life ceased to bear the dimensions of a black and white morality tale.

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.340
Readers of the novel saw how easy it is to have a thoroughly miserable marriage

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.460
without being in any way a bad person.

00:01:53.460 --> 00:02:00.900
Flaubert's novel shows us the tensions and travails of married life without ever really taking sides.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:07.080
Emma gets bored with her husband Charles, 
loses interest in her child, runs up debts, has affairs

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.980
and eventually kills herself.

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:12.900
But by the time readers are taken in how she'd pushed arsenic into her mouth

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.320
and been laid down in her bedroom to await her death, they would not be in a mood to judge.

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:23.360
All they'd be able to feel was pity, the cruelty and senselessness of life.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:29.360
Flaubert seemed almost deliberately to enjoy unsettling the desire to find easy answers.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.520
No sooner had he presented Emma in a positive light than he would undercut her with an ironic remark.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.200
But then, just as readers were losing patience with her, he would draw them back to her,

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.240
would tell them something about her sensitivity that would bring tears to the eyes.

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.600
We end Flaubert's novel with fear and sadness

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.640
that how we've been made to live 
before we begin to know how,

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.880
that how limited our understanding of ourselves and others is,

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:59.600
that how great and catastrophic are the consequences of our actions, that how pitiless and vengeful

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.000
the upstanding members of the community can be 
in response to our errors.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.480
Tragedy inspires us to abandon ordinary life's simplified, judgmental perspective on failure and defeat

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:17.200
rendering as generous towards the foolishness and errors that are endemic to our nature.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.960
A particular aspect of Madame Bovary's tragic end sticks out.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:29.400
Flaubert tells us in no uncertain terms that the reason Emma Bovary grew so dissatisfied

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.240
unfairly so, with marriage, and therefore embarked on her disastrous affairs

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.440
was because of the books she had read.

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.440
Flaubert tells us that from a young age Emma used to read bad romantic novels

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.080
that gave her an unrealistic, overly rosy picture of love

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.520
and that meant that she was unprepared
for the reality of marriage.

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:54.720
Emma didn't know how boring it can be to have dinner with the same person every night

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.040
and how difficult it is to keep a relationship alive after once had a baby.

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.180
And therefore she responded to these
situations with too greater degree of panic

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.660
having multiple affairs to remind
herself that she was still capable of

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.960
passion and going shopping for far more
than she could afford as an alternative

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:14.560
to the sometimes tedious business of
bringing up a child.

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.390
What might ultimately have saved Emma
Bovary was to read the novel of which

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:20.950
she is the heroine.

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:26.170
It's a novel about love designed to cure
us of the naive illusions about love

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:29.170
created by bad novels.

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:35.640
Flaubert couldn't stand newspapers. 
He belonged to a generation that had experienced

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:40.200
the rise of mass circulation media at
first hand and he believed that this was

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:46.800
spreading a new kind of stupidity which he termed 
'la bêtise' (stupidity) into every corner of France.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.940
Idiocy wasn't the same as
ignorance for Flaubert

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.900
because it was compatible with knowing a lot of things

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.060
it just meant understanding nothing.

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.940
The most loathsome character in
Madame Bovary, the pharmacists Homais,

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:03.500
is introduced early on as an avid consumer
of news

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.520
who sets aside a special hour every day
to study 'le journal'.

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:12.780
Flaubert keeps the word in italics throughout to send up
the neo religious reverence

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.100
in which this object is held.

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:18.200
In the 1870s, Flaubert began keeping a record of

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:21.840
what he judged to be the most idiotic
patterns of thought promoted by the

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.200
modern world in general and by
newspapers in particular.

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.340
Published posthumously as 
'The Dictionary of Received Ideas'

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:34.020
this collection of clichés organized by
topic was described by its author as an

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:40.340
« encyclopédie de la bêtise humaine » 
an encyclopedia of human stupidity.

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:45.820
Here is a random sampling of its entries:
Budget - never balanced.

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:51.420
Catholicism - has had a very good influence on art.
Christianity - freed the slaves.

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:57.120
Crusades - benefited Venetian trade.
Diamonds - to think that they're nothing but coal

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.480
if we came across one in its natural state

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.780
we wouldn't even bother to pick it up
off the ground.

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:06.260
Exercise - prevents all illnesses, to be recommended at all times.

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:09.050
Photography - will make painting obsolete.

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:13.810
It's worth noting how many of the  dictionary's clichés touch on sophisticated disciplines

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:19.460
like theology, science and politics without, however,
going anywhere very clever with them.

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:24.900
The modern idiot can routinely know what
only geniuses had known in the past and

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:29.730
yet he is still an idiot, a depressing
combination of traits that previous eras

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:31.820
had never had to worry about.

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:37.820
The newspapers had, for Flaubert, armed stupidity and given authority to fools.

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:44.740
Gustave Flaubert was a bourgeois, 
a middle-class Frenchman,

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:49.340
and yet he loathed a great deal to do with his country and his class.

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:54.000
For Flaubert, the French bourgeoisie could be a repository of the most extreme prudery,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.480
snobbery, smugness, racism and pomposity.

00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:02.560
"It's strange how the most banal utterances of the bourgeoisie sometimes make me marvel"

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:06.731
he once complained and stifled rage,
"there are gestures, sounds of people's

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:11.270
voices that I just can't get over, 
silly remarks that almost give me vertigo

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:14.380
the bourgeoisie is for me something unfathomable."

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:19.240
Flaubert wrote that he had
nothing but disdain for this good civilization

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:25.720
that prided itself on having produced
railways, poisons, cream tarts, royalty and the guillotine.

00:07:25.729 --> 00:07:28.829
What Flaubert hated above all was pomposity.

00:07:28.829 --> 00:07:33.980
This quote to his girlfriend, Louise Colet, written in 1846 gives us an insight.

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:36.700
"What stops me from taking myself
seriously,

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:41.840
even though I'm essentially a serious
person, is that I find myself extremely ridiculous.

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:45.660
Not the kind of small-scale
ridiculousness of slapstick comedy

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:49.520
but rather a ridiculousness that seems
intrinsic to human life

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:53.860
and manifests itself in the simplest actions and most ordinary gestures.

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:59.480
For example, I can never shave without starting to laugh, it seems so idiotic.

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:02.340
All this is very difficult to explain.

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:05.719
Flaubert in the end wanted to be a global citizen.

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:10.020
"I'm no more modern than ancient, no more
French than Chinese", he wrote,

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:16.420
"and the idea of having a native country, that is to
say, the imperative to live on one bit of ground

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:20.700
marked red or blue on the map and
to hate the other bits in green or black

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:24.820
has always seemed to me narrow minded,
blinked and profoundly stupid.

00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:31.110
I am a soul brother to everything that lives, to the giraffe and to the crocodile as much as to the man."

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:36.360
In his "Dictionary of Received Ideas" 
there was an entry on 'French'.

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:41.060
How proud one is to be French when one looks at the Colonne Vendôme.

00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:46.440
Paradoxically, one can perhaps be proudest to be French when one reads Gustave Flaubert.

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:52.760
Foreside from hating a lot about his country, Flaubert also captures some of its best and wisest sides.

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:59.560
We should read him for his earthiness, his humanity, his frankness and above all else his generosity of spirit.

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:03.760
At the age of 17, in a somewhat melodramatic mood Flaubert wrote

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:09.610
"Art is superior to everything, a book of
poetry is worth more than a railway."

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:14.420
It rarely is, but it might almost be
worth giving up a railway line or two

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:17.120
for the sake of Flaubert's works.
