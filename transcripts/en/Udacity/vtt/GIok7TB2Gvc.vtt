00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.270
So how did we get this answer? Now, the pattern here

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:05.500
shows that it's most likely autosomal and not sex-linked or maternal,

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.810
because we see an even number of males and females affected

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:10.990
here, only 1 to 1. We don't see only males or

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:14.310
only females. And it can't be maternal because if we have

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:17.900
an affected child, they should all be affected and the mother

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.180
would also be affected. So this is most likely an autosomal

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.980
inheritance pattern. And it's most likely

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.200
recessive, because the trait skips generations.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.810
And unaffected parents give rise to affected offspring.

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.410
If it were dominant, it would be the other

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.850
way around where we would have affected parents,

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.930
with affected offspring, and the trait not skipping generations.
