00:00:00.226 --> 00:00:01.573
- [Voiceover] Hey,
grammarians, so we've already

00:00:01.573 --> 00:00:05.207
talked about the idea of the comparative

00:00:05.207 --> 00:00:07.645
modifiers, right, so you
know the difference between

00:00:07.645 --> 00:00:10.954
saying something is cute
and then saying that

00:00:10.954 --> 00:00:13.659
something is cuter than
that thing, and then

00:00:13.659 --> 00:00:15.690
looking at, like, I don't know,
let's say we're looking at

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.978
a puppy or a mushroom, a little mushroom

00:00:17.978 --> 00:00:19.406
with a smiley face and you'd say,

00:00:19.406 --> 00:00:22.877
"Oh, that's the world's cutest mushroom."

00:00:22.877 --> 00:00:24.920
Right, that's the comparative,
we've already covered that.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.289
I would like to talk
about something I think is

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:29.541
a really interesting topic.

00:00:29.541 --> 00:00:30.273
"What's that," you say?

00:00:30.273 --> 00:00:34.394
A really interesting topic.

00:00:34.394 --> 00:00:38.063
Now, what's that really doing there

00:00:38.063 --> 00:00:40.397
in this little phrase?

00:00:40.397 --> 00:00:42.475
A really interesting topic.

00:00:42.475 --> 00:00:44.228
Well, it's modifying interesting.

00:00:44.228 --> 00:00:47.246
We recognize that this
is an adverb, right?

00:00:47.246 --> 00:00:51.623
Really is modifying interesting,
which is an adjective.

00:00:51.623 --> 00:00:54.967
Interesting, in turn, is modifying topic.

00:00:54.967 --> 00:00:59.967
But, the question is,
what does really mean?

00:01:01.155 --> 00:01:03.242
What is it's function?

00:01:03.242 --> 00:01:05.123
And the answer is that it's a type of word

00:01:05.123 --> 00:01:06.713
we call an intensifier.

00:01:06.713 --> 00:01:10.231
So the function of really
is to just double down

00:01:10.231 --> 00:01:11.729
on the idea of interesting.

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.528
So it's not just an interesting topic,

00:01:13.528 --> 00:01:15.691
it's a really interesting topic.

00:01:15.691 --> 00:01:18.928
You could also say it's
a very interesting topic.

00:01:18.928 --> 00:01:23.297
Or even, an extremely interesting topic.

00:01:23.297 --> 00:01:26.136
And that kind of gets us
into this other category

00:01:26.136 --> 00:01:28.540
which is called adverbs of degree.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.908
So an intensifier, let me
just step back a little bit,

00:01:30.908 --> 00:01:34.101
an intensifier is a type of adverb that

00:01:34.101 --> 00:01:37.119
modifies an adjective or
another adverb in a way

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:41.496
that doubles down on the
modified thing's meaning.

00:01:41.496 --> 00:01:43.656
So it's not just an interesting topic,

00:01:43.656 --> 00:01:47.441
it's a really interesting topic,
so it's like extra special,

00:01:47.441 --> 00:01:48.415
extra interesting.

00:01:48.415 --> 00:01:53.257
It makes, it intensifies,
it really accentuates

00:01:53.257 --> 00:01:55.928
or makes clear the fact
that you're trying to

00:01:55.928 --> 00:02:00.830
drive home the
interesting-ness of this topic.

00:02:01.943 --> 00:02:03.961
But frankly talking about
how interesting a topic is

00:02:03.961 --> 00:02:06.091
is a pretty good shortcut for boring,

00:02:06.091 --> 00:02:08.843
so in order to talk
about adverbs of degree

00:02:08.843 --> 00:02:11.292
I'm going to talk instead about the

00:02:11.292 --> 00:02:14.555
Incredibly Deadly Viper,

00:02:14.555 --> 00:02:17.695
which is a creature from

00:02:17.695 --> 00:02:19.988
A Series of Unfortunate
Events by Lemony Snicket,

00:02:19.988 --> 00:02:24.111
so the Incredibly Deadly

00:02:24.111 --> 00:02:26.693
Viper.

00:02:29.925 --> 00:02:34.154
There it is, there's your
terrifying, horned viper, yonder.

00:02:34.154 --> 00:02:36.871
And what the word incredibly is doing here

00:02:36.871 --> 00:02:41.770
is, it is serving as
an intensifier, right.

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:46.770
But it is also what we like
to call an adverb of degree

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:50.086
because it's saying the extent to which

00:02:50.086 --> 00:02:52.117
this viper is so very deadly.

00:02:52.117 --> 00:02:56.553
However, if this viper had a cousin

00:02:56.553 --> 00:03:00.845
that was the somewhat deadly viper,

00:03:02.487 --> 00:03:05.634
maybe we can blunt its teeth somewhat,

00:03:05.634 --> 00:03:09.196
maybe it's got square teeth.

00:03:09.196 --> 00:03:12.383
That's the somewhat deadly viper.

00:03:12.383 --> 00:03:14.940
We can see that somewhat, this word here

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.005
is changing the meaning of the phrase.

00:03:18.005 --> 00:03:20.257
It's not just the deadly viper,

00:03:20.257 --> 00:03:22.533
it's the somewhat deadly viper.

00:03:22.533 --> 00:03:27.200
It's import has been blunted
slightly as have its teeth.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.475
And you could also say, what if he didn't

00:03:29.475 --> 00:03:32.866
have any teeth at all, this
ostensibly deadly viper?

00:03:32.866 --> 00:03:35.605
What if he just had little gums?

00:03:35.605 --> 00:03:40.388
Well then he's the barely deadly viper,

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:45.938
instead.

00:03:45.938 --> 00:03:48.260
And these words like
incredibly and somewhat

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.732
and barely, these are adverbs of degree,

00:03:51.732 --> 00:03:53.998
so they illustrate the degree to which

00:03:53.998 --> 00:03:57.795
the viper is deadly dangerous.

00:03:57.795 --> 00:04:00.453
So that's basically what intensifiers

00:04:00.453 --> 00:04:04.354
and adverbs of degree do.

00:04:04.354 --> 00:04:06.804
So, whenever you think of an intensifier

00:04:06.804 --> 00:04:10.844
just think of the word very,

00:04:10.844 --> 00:04:12.435
and when you're trying to figure out

00:04:12.435 --> 00:04:13.974
what an adverb of degree is, well that

00:04:13.974 --> 00:04:17.863
kind of answers the question, how much?

00:04:17.863 --> 00:04:19.709
So if you want to double down on the

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:21.300
meaning of something
you use an intensifier

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:24.237
like very or extremely, and if you want to

00:04:24.237 --> 00:04:27.423
express a degree of something

00:04:27.423 --> 00:04:32.283
you could say, let's say we're
talking about a cup of tea

00:04:32.283 --> 00:04:34.978
or something and you want
to express how warm it is.

00:04:34.978 --> 00:04:37.254
You could say it's too hot.

00:04:37.254 --> 00:04:41.178
You could say it's slightly hot.

00:04:41.178 --> 00:04:44.722
You could say somewhat,

00:04:45.706 --> 00:04:47.877
or almost hot.

00:04:47.877 --> 00:04:50.768
There are a lot of
different adverbs of degree.

00:04:50.768 --> 00:04:54.321
But that's basically the distinction.

00:04:54.321 --> 00:04:57.163
An intensifier is powerful but

00:04:57.163 --> 00:04:59.545
it has a very narrow usage.

00:04:59.545 --> 00:05:01.530
And adverbs of degree, you can use for

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:04.874
a wide range of uses to express

00:05:04.874 --> 00:05:08.323
a variety of different meanings.

00:05:08.323 --> 00:05:11.005
That's intensifiers and adverbs of degree.

00:05:11.005 --> 00:05:12.270
You can learn anything.

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:13.284
David out.
