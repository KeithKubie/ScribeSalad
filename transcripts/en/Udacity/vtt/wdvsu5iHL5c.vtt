Okay. So I've created my display work function.

00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:07.200
And inside of it, I've filled in all the code that I used to display my work.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.240
When I go back the page and

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.140
hit refresh, we can see that my work section actually has disappeared.

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:14.940
I can see the other sections because, okay, well because James and

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.550
I are cheating and we already have the answers in.

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.760
But, the work section's gone, and that's because we never invoked our code.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.630
We don't see anything happen because we never invoked our code.

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.199
Let's investigate how to invoke functions.
