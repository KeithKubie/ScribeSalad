so all of us experience the world around

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340
so all of us experience the world around
 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.990
so all of us experience the world around
us with our five senses we see we smell

we hear we touch and we taste and we
 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.120
we hear we touch and we taste and we
react to our world based on what we

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130
react to our world based on what we
 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.790
react to our world based on what we
experience with those senses and as we

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800
experience with those senses and as we
 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.709

enough just to know that I'm at a

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460
enough just to know that I'm at a
 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:39.860
enough just to know that I'm at a
specific place that I'm at the coffee

specific place that I'm at the coffee
 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.780
specific place that I'm at the coffee
shop but knowing what it is that I'm

doing there that I'm standing in line

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200
doing there that I'm standing in line
 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.990
doing there that I'm standing in line
can be really useful in providing a

can be really useful in providing a
 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.870
can be really useful in providing a
better experience for my users maybe by

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880
better experience for my users maybe by
 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.610
better experience for my users maybe by
knowing that I'm standing in line my app

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620
knowing that I'm standing in line my app
 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.260
knowing that I'm standing in line my app
can tell me hey instead of waiting

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270

took a step back and we worked really

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330
took a step back and we worked really
 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:10.610

00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:00.900
last year we introduced awareness API
 

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:04.780
last year we introduced awareness API
which offers a common and simple to use

00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:04.790
which offers a common and simple to use
 

00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:07.760
which offers a common and simple to use
interface to access all these contextual

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:07.770
interface to access all these contextual
 

00:15:07.770 --> 00:15:10.880
interface to access all these contextual
signals and to seamlessly combine them

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:10.890
signals and to seamlessly combine them
 

00:15:10.890 --> 00:15:12.680
signals and to seamlessly combine them
in a way that gives you a more powerful

so you'll have to check that the Penske

00:18:59.330 --> 00:18:59.340
so you'll have to check that the Penske

that you're receiving trigger events on
 

00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:02.690
that you're receiving trigger events on
is the one that you're interested in and

easily with our snapshot API with a
 

00:19:13.050 --> 00:19:15.110
easily with our snapshot API with a
single line so this gives you the

00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:15.120
single line so this gives you the
 

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:16.580
single line so this gives you the
current weather at the current location

00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:16.590
current weather at the current location
 

00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:20.690

it in a way that's power and resources
efficient so for example in this

00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:31.440
efficient so for example in this
 

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:33.770
efficient so for example in this
scenario that I just mentioned awareness

00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:33.780
scenario that I just mentioned awareness
 

00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:36.020
