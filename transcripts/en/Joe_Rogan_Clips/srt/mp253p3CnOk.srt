1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:04,480
The Joe Rogan experience.
Do you have guys trash talk you

2
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:10,680
like you're pretty easy going guy.
Easy going. It's nothing to my face.

3
00:00:10,681 --> 00:00:14,010
It's always subtle. If, if I ever
hear about anybody saying something,

4
00:00:14,011 --> 00:00:16,320
it's just through word of mouth
and I'm just like, yeah, well,

5
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:21,210
but you never had like a Conor McGregor
type incident were only only in the

6
00:00:21,211 --> 00:00:24,870
beginning with Paul Craig.
But I think it was just,

7
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:30,960
it was just like his thing. We've
like, we smashed that beef, you know?

8
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:35,100
Yeah. But what do you think about
trash talking in this day and age?

9
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:36,690
Because in many ways it looked,

10
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:39,360
Connor's an amazing fighter
and his fighting skills,

11
00:00:39,361 --> 00:00:42,000
what's made him such an
international superstar,

12
00:00:42,001 --> 00:00:46,710
but he also talks some mad shit and that
helped him too because he was so good

13
00:00:46,711 --> 00:00:51,630
at it. It was funny. He would say funny,
mean insulting Shit. It was fucking great.

14
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:55,410
100% yeah. But I think what
people forget, Joe, is that like,

15
00:00:55,411 --> 00:00:58,170
that's always been Connor,
even when you go and, and, and,

16
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,780
and look at the,
the,

17
00:01:00,781 --> 00:01:04,080
the interviews from before he was
a in the UFC and he was just like,

18
00:01:04,081 --> 00:01:06,240
I'm going to make a bunch of money
and I'm going to be all this.

19
00:01:06,241 --> 00:01:10,710
And so like he created
that for himself and yeah,

20
00:01:10,711 --> 00:01:14,790
he made a bunch of money from talking
trash because he always had a plan that

21
00:01:14,791 --> 00:01:17,490
that's was, that's what
he was going to do. Yeah.

22
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:21,240
And so I think people try to hop on it
just to sell tickets or get money and

23
00:01:21,241 --> 00:01:22,051
sometimes it works,

24
00:01:22,051 --> 00:01:25,530
it gets people wanting to watch and it
gets your name up and stuff like that.

25
00:01:25,531 --> 00:01:28,800
But that's not the time.
But name I want to make for myself.

26
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:30,960
Like I don't like people
talking trash to me.

27
00:01:30,961 --> 00:01:34,560
So I'm not really gonna talk trash to
anybody unless there's something that's

28
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:38,670
really personal. But if I don't
know you and I don't care about you,

29
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:42,000
then I don't really consider it.
Like why would I talk trash?

30
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:43,350
I don't even care about you.

31
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,990
It's a waste of energy.
It's a waste of their,

32
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:53,540
like I got so much other
stuff to care about her on.

33
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:57,950
Yeah, it's, well, it's a very
healthy look man. I mean the way you,

34
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,490
you're seeing like that you said healthy,

35
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:04,550
like I like to maintain a healthy heart
and mind as much as possible students.

36
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:10,680
Damn man. Like mental health is a
real thing, you know what I mean?

37
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:12,660
And especially like,

38
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,720
especially just having certain obligations
and and just using social media and

39
00:02:17,941 --> 00:02:21,420
having people reach out and they say
like, oh ignore this, ignore that.

40
00:02:21,421 --> 00:02:25,530
But it's like, man, it's like, it's hard
to just ignore certain things, you know,

41
00:02:25,531 --> 00:02:27,240
like you still see things then.

42
00:02:27,241 --> 00:02:31,140
So just that and condition of the
world and just everything man,

43
00:02:31,141 --> 00:02:35,190
being in multiple different countries
and here in this news and that news and

44
00:02:35,191 --> 00:02:37,620
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
Like for a person who like,

45
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,770
who wants to care about the world,

46
00:02:40,771 --> 00:02:44,730
they're just genuinely cares like a lock
and go on in my mind. So I'm just like,

47
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,190
ah,
I don't even want that in my heart now.

48
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:49,910
I'm just going to do my best to
kind of keep my own peace and, uh,

49
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:53,580
come fight time.
I let it loose.

50
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:01,400
[inaudible].
