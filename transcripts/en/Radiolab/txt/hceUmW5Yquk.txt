Speaker 1:          00:00          This is Radiolab. I'm Robert Krulwich and Jad Abumrad, and this hour I'm going to curse you dad. I'm going to ask you to just simply do this final thing. You know that song that we both hate? Oh, which one? Pump pump, pump pump. God. It's like the moment you start that and keep going here, he can. You think there are some songs that I can stick in your head and they just won't leave. There's somebody of course who's head who got this song somehow stuck in her head and then his songs that just won't go away because you didn't even invite them and they stay. This is an hour on the music in our heads. Where does the songs come from? Why do they stay our whole hour without Suzanne Vega? Thankfully on radio lab. Let me ask you a question that could get us started here. When a song gets stuck in your head, do you even have one in there right now by any chance?

Speaker 1:          00:51          Oliver, the Broadway show tune of course. What does it sound like when it's in there? What does it sound like? Yeah, but it just think before you answered. What does it really sound like? Describe it a musically. Um, well, it does. Well, it's funny that you mentioned this. It, it's doesn't actually, I don't hear any musician because it loud. No, it's nothing. It's not loud. It's like a location. No. Tambour no, it just has a melody. A vague foggy. Like a shadow email. Yes, exactly. Okay. Well, so that's our starting point. You know, most of us get a song in our head. It's kind of like what you described, vague, but there are people who when they get songs stuck in our head, it's a whole, it's a whole different experience. It is not vague. In fact, they wish it were vague. They wish we're a shadow

Speaker 2:          01:40          and you'll know what I mean. In a second, let me introduce you to someone. Mary had a little lamb, little lamb. Little lamb always has songs running through his head everywhere that Mary went, the lamb was sure to go. He's plagued by them actually. Then he spoke with our producer, Lulu Miller. That was going through your head just now. That's right. Mary heard a little loud over and over again. Let me have you just introduce yourself really quick. Oh, I'm uh, my name is Leo rang girl and I'm a not young. I just had my 94th birthday. I've been in la since I was in the War World War II as a psychoanalyst. Oh yeah. I'm still in practice. We find everything that's been going on in his own head sort of intriguing, like from a professional standpoint. I'm trying to think what the hell am I doing? Anyway, this whole thing started for him about 12 years ago. He had just had major heart surgery and he wakes up in his hospital bed. I wake up in the ICU and almost as soon as I'm conscious outside my hospital window, I hear music and there was this, it sounded few near-real like hymns. I hear these songs. I look out the window. I thought, Geez, a rabbi is out there.

Speaker 2:          02:54          I say to my kids, I casually say, uh, hey, there's a, there's a rabbi this singing.

Speaker 3:          03:00          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          03:00          They said, what do you mean? So I said, there must be as rabbi school and he must be teaching young people how to be rabbis. And they, the kids looked at each other,

Speaker 3:          03:12          the [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          03:13          because they weren't hearing anything. But at that moment, that didn't matter to Leo because the music was so loud and vivid to him. So totally coming through that window that

Speaker 2:          03:23          I dismissed them as, oh well they could have their opinion if they want. I didn't think anything of it.

Speaker 3:          03:31          Uh, Duh, Duh, Duh.

Speaker 2:          03:32          And then the rest of the week in the hospital, uh, you know, I'm getting better and better and as I get better, the music changes, right.

Speaker 4:          03:42          I started being a much more perky and the songs, the music out the window changes to Chattanooga, Choo Choo. Did Dod do the chat? The new to Chattanooga Choo Choo did you Julie? Well, one of the morning, two in the morning, I'm waking up with these songs always coming in from right outside that window. Then I thought, Jesus isn't pretty energetic group. They're across the street at this point. Leo was beginning to suspect that something a little weird was going on. But the real coup, the grog came when I was going to leave the hospital.

Speaker 2:          04:19          There were a week or so and the this tunes,

Speaker 4:          04:22          I didn't know the words at first, but I started to hear that that Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah. Z. Packed up, signed out of the hospital and got into his car. I was reflecting. That's when it hit him. I still was hearing the song. The song was still coming from outside a window, but now the scenery was moving. I thought it was related to the hospital until the thing across the street. Here I am in the car listening to this. Oh, and that's when the lyrics appear. Yeah. Finally the words come when Johnny comes marching home again. Oh Rah Rah. He couldn't ignore it anymore. Not only was the song following him home, it's like the song was about him. He was the Johnny. The girls would here with marching home, coming home from the hospital. I realized I am listening to me. I am listening to me.

Speaker 1:          05:16          Okay. Is He really though? I mean, is he really listening to anything or is he just think he's hearing something? Well, there's nothing out there for him to hear right from the inside. Like is this brain actually hearing music? [inaudible] he for us, there's a professor in England who had the exact same question. I called him up.

Speaker 5:          05:35          Hello.

Speaker 1:          05:36          Hi. Can I speak to professor Griffith please? Okay. Tim Griffith is his name. He is a professor of cognitive neurology at New Castle University. Here's what he did. He took 35 people who are likely a who claim to be hallucinating music. Yeah. And he scanned their brains, right? Simple experiment.

Speaker 5:          05:51          I just put people on a scan run and said, what are you hearing now? What are you hearing now when they told him, uh, there,

Speaker 1:          05:58          there, I'm hearing music that that moment he would snap a picture of their brain, right? Then he took a different group of people who have no hallucinations, played them real music, [inaudible] music, scan their brains, and then he compared the pictures.

Speaker 5:          06:11          And if you look,

Speaker 1:          06:12          they look virtually identical.

Speaker 5:          06:13          Know if you would've put those in front of me and say ones, people hallucinating the others, people being played, music I, I wouldn't be able to tell you, which was weird,

Speaker 1:          06:21          which tells you two things. First, this condition is real. These people are not making it up. And second, this goes way beyond the ordinary experience that the rest of us have where we get a song stuck in our head. These people are getting the full high Phi experience of listening to music. Their entire brain is lit up. The music sounds so convincingly like real life music. What are you to think when it suddenly appears? That's Diana Deutsch, a psychologist at the University of California, San Diego, who's been collecting emails from hundreds of different people who hallucinate music. One person described it in the following way. He said, imagine that you were at a rock concert standing right by loudspeaker. Well, it's louder than that.

Speaker 2:          07:05          At the beginning when I didn't know what was going to happen, I thought it was going to take over my mind. It started interfering with sleep. It's the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe.

Speaker 6:          07:18          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          07:18          well night. Oh and I, I got mad. I used to say stop it already. [inaudible] cut it out. Come on enough. Enough. Enough. But you never know.

Speaker 6:          07:30          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          07:30          yes, I never sleep. Yes. That was the low point. I thought, I've got to get help for this. At what point did you bring it up with doctors? Oh, the doctors completely impotent. To this day, they rolled their eyes. When I tell them about it, one doctor told him that maybe it was the fillings in his teeth picking up the radio. Okay. I hoped it was right, but it wasn't, it continued forever. Nothing he could do could make it stop. I don't have any

Speaker 7:          07:55          off button. It's like there was a jukebox in his head run by an evil Gremlin and the worst part, the Gremlin would mess with the tempo.

Speaker 2:          08:03          Like, uh, okay, uh, [inaudible] that Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, and love the men on the flight.

Speaker 8:          08:12          Daring young man, only the flagging [inaudible] Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah. That's the worst. When that started to happen, I really was getting close to panic as I have the feeling that it could go at its rate and I couldn't stop it. It's like you're on a galloping horse. The horse is running away with you. Dude. I once told that to my daughter. She said, dad, why don't you just instead think of the song?

Speaker 2:          08:47          No. And I could control the tempo and I end instead. When that was galloping, I would go, uh, I did, uh,

Speaker 9:          08:57          uh, the [inaudible]

Speaker 10:         09:06          an immediately up, completely relaxed,

Speaker 1:          09:11          and the Gallup is

Speaker 10:         09:13          completely gone and I couldn't even let it come

Speaker 1:          09:15          back. And it would start now being, Oh God,

Speaker 8:          09:19          no, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah.

Speaker 1:          09:21          Yeah.

Speaker 8:          09:26          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          09:27          and that was no longer ever a problem of the tempo running away with me. Okay. So let's just assume Leo is not crazy. I never thought I was psychotic. Never. Never. Because most people, it turns out with this condition are not crazy. There's nothing else wrong with them. According to Diana Deutsch. So then the question becomes, how can a person who is otherwise sane hallucinate

Speaker 11:         09:49          to such a crazy degree? Well, in the 60s there was a Polish psychologist named Jersey Konarski who thought about this and and he came up with a simple kind of beautiful idea based on an assumption that he couldn't prove yet, which was that between the ears and the brain, there are some connections. He thought just a few stray connections that run backwards brain back to ear, which would allow sound to run in reverse. Now, this was just an idea. He couldn't really test it, but many years later,

Speaker 1:          10:19          neuroscientists like Tim Griffith start to poke around in the brain. They start to explore and what they find is that he was right.

Speaker 5:          10:27          Yes, daily, right? Do you look at the pathway between the years and the brain? Probably about 70% of the fibers don't actually go up. They go down, they go the other way. Towards the end,

Speaker 1:          10:36          70% go. 70% go from the brain to the ears. Yeah. It's like our ears are literally wired to hear our brains now. Konarski. His idea was that normally our ears wouldn't hear what the brain was saying because it was too busy. You taking in all the sounds from the outside, but what if he thought this sound from the outside stopped? Maybe then there would be a kind of backflow sound stored in your brain would start to flow backwards. Now again, this is just an idea, but there might be something to this because it would explain why most of the people who suffer from musical hallucinations, according to Tim Griffith have one thing in common

Speaker 5:          11:17          by far and away. The common situation you see it in is in people who have deafness usually in middle or later life,

Speaker 12:         11:23          and you have to take his word for it. Nearly the instant that I went deaf, I started experiencing round the clock, 24 seven auditory hallucinations.

Speaker 1:          11:33          This is Michael Cora's twin. He was 36 he lost all of his hearing and he remembers the moment that it happened. He was in the emergency room talking to a nurse and suddenly the sound started to go.

Speaker 12:         11:43          It was like going from talking like this to talking like this, to talking like this, to talk like my ears were just draining out like water draining out of the, uh, of about, uh, I just king devore endeavor endeavor. And at the same time I was dying to hear

Speaker 13:         11:58          a very loud ringing sound in my ears. It was gradually morphing prints of sort of formless Erie, ethereal music, music of the spheres really.

Speaker 14:         12:15          And you could slowly more into some version of the Aven Maria

Speaker 15:         12:30          [inaudible].

Speaker 14:         12:30          It was almost as if as a sort of recompense to being deaf, I was like plugged into some sort of deep background Melly and the cosmos. Now here's the question. What would happen if Michael suddenly got his hearing back? Well, a couple of months later, Michael got a cochlear implant installed. This is a little chip. It's put into his brain, which promised to return at least part of his hearing. And he says, when the doctor's turns on, the moment he says they turned it on, it sounds from the world came rushing in and the music stopped,

Speaker 12:         13:10          stopped, called just went away almost instantaneously. Huh? There you go. Well, but I happen to know a woman who had a very, very different experience. What do you mean is she had the same problem. She went deaf, she started hearing music. What's, what kind of music was it? Um, Hans spirituals, patriotic songs are her name. This is actually her real name. It's Cheryl C's or we're going to call her sheet. Wanted the music in her head to stop. And she'd heard about a patient, like your friend there who had musical, whose nation's received a cochlear implant and her hallucinations disappeared. So I wanted to do it. So she did it. She got the implant, she wakes up on the operating table and I heard the music. It was inside me still there. Just was there. I can't stop it. Why in the first case? And they're, they're kind of the same situation.

Speaker 12:         14:06          They are very much the same. Why would there be that difference? I don't know why there is this difference between those. So I asked, uh, Dr. Oliver Sacks, who we often talk to on these questions. How do you explain the difference as a physician? Um, you know, um, one sees patients that you ask about their symptoms, they produce their symptoms, but it is equally important to see the relation of the symptoms of the disease to the person themselves, to their identity. He's discovered over the years that the problem is expressed in the patient is partly a disease. I mean, the person is sick or in trouble in some way. At the same time, the disease is reflecting something about the person in front of him and sees interaction and a liaison, a collusion, the condition, I don't know what word to use between the self and a symptom can sometimes it can come out.

Speaker 12:         14:58          So strangely, for example, there is a, a patient he has who was a Jewish, he was a Jewish boy who, who to who? Them grown up in Hamburg in the 1920s and 1930s and he had been terrified by the Nazi youth and for some horrible reason he hallucinated Nazi marching songs. He was tormented. But on the other hand, Oliver told me about an old woman he wants made in a nursing home who was haunted by lullabies, one after the other nonstop at sea. She was an orphan. Father died before she was born and her mother before she was five orphaned alone. She found the songs in her head deeply comforting the music and the hallucinations in fact seem to be a door into a lost part of childhood. So then the differences between people and music floods into their head. What's going on says Oliver is the disease and the person they're talking to each other, the, the self can be molded by hallucination, but it can mold them in turn. I wonder where Leo fits into this. Lulu, how would you say that Leo self interacts with his symptoms or vice versa?

Speaker 1:          16:11          Well, uh, he's a psychoanalyst, so whenever he gets a song stuck in his head, which is like all the time, he analyzes it, he looks for a hidden meaning and [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          16:21          like, you know the way dreams reveal your inner life. The same thing with songs.

Speaker 1:          16:26          Leo will tell you that every song is a message from his subconscious.

Speaker 2:          16:29          Everything has an unconscious connection, pleasant or unpleasant, and he's just got to figure out what it is. I'm analyzing me like I have a patient in front of me. Like when I,

Speaker 1:          16:40          I called him up, he had, Mary had a little lamb stuck in his head that he told me it was because he'd been thinking about, Yep.

Speaker 2:          16:45          Passivity of the American people in following a leader that misleads them. And everywhere that Mary went, the lambs was sure to go, I'm in and the connection is obvious.

Speaker 1:          16:56          Or when he first got home from the hospital, he always had America. The beautiful stuck in his head.

Speaker 2:          17:02          And I'm certainly not a raving patriot, but what this meant was homes, sweet America to me was home.

Speaker 1:          17:12          It's easy to think that this is kind of a stretch. I mean every song has some very specific meaning for him, but I dunno, there was this one time he told me about where he woke up with a song in his head.

Speaker 2:          17:26          I stopped going to brush my teeth. I'm singing along as I go to the bathroom. This is what it was. It's just a few years after his wife had died, my Barney lows over the ocean. My Bernie lies over the sea. My Bernie lies over the ocean that Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah. Bring back, bring back, bring back my Bonnie to me. To me. Yeah. And um, I realized when I, I, why am I singing that song? And then suddenly I realized it was our wedding anniversary that week. That was one of our major anniversaries. You know, that song can kill me when I hear it.

Speaker 1:          18:16          Even so he told me that when that song comes, he doesn't want it to go.

Speaker 2:          18:21          I found that when the song disappeared that I didn't want it to disappear.

Speaker 1:          18:25          It's now been over a decade of hallucinating music for Leo. And he found that at some point the music switched and went from intruder to friend

Speaker 2:          18:35          that Duh, Duh, Duh Duh. Now he looks forward to the song stoves and still guitars at the company to Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah. He finds himself alone that the the in Monterey. It's true that one of the things about being 94 is that when you look at your telephone address book, the half of them are not there anymore. You scratch out the name and that's not easy. No, no, no. Just Molly and me and baby makes three all happy. And uh, the loo heaven [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          19:10          radio labs. Lulu Miller. Thanks Lulu. Yep, thanks to Leo. Leo has a book out about living with musical hallucinations. It's called music in the head, living at the brain mind border. And so does Michael [inaudible]. He's the guy with the cochlear implant. His book is called rebuilt my journey back to the hearing world. You can find links to all of those on our website. Radio lab.org special thanks to Oliver Sacks who basically gave us his Rolodex and we were able to combine all these people that interview that while thanks to LRA and Kate Edgar, here's a system. Absolutely no Robert, before we go to break, I just don't play it. One more clip, if you don't mind, couldn't figure out a place to put it. From my interview with Diana Deutsch, I was asking her about musical hallucinations and where this stuff comes from, like where does the music come from, what triggers it? And she told me basically, well, it can be anything. A striking example was somebody who wanted very much for her hallucinations to go and suddenly they did go away. And so she said, oh great. This is the sound of silence. And immediately

Speaker 9:          20:07          song Sandra silence darkness. Simon and Garfunkel started at our glued. So Radiolab will continue in a month.
