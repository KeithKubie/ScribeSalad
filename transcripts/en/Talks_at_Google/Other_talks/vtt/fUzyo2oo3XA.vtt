00:00:05.845 --> 00:00:07.220
SPEAKER 1: And
I'm really honored

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.220
to be hosting Shabnam
Tolouei here today

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:12.200
to discuss the
impact of immigration

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.330
on professional career.

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.600
Shabnam is an award winning
Iranian actress, theater

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.340
director, and playwright.

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.610
She's won multiple awards from
the International Fajre Theater

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:25.850
Festival, which is the most
prestigious venue for theater

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:27.530
in Iran.

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:31.820
In 2006, however, her
successful career came to a halt

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.440
when the Iranian
government banned her

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.470
from working due
to her religion.

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.640
Determined to resist efforts to
stifle her artistic expression,

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.760
she relocated to France
to restart her career.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.070
She is most widely
known internationally

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.070
for her starring role
as Munis in the award

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.430
winning Iranian film,
"Women Without Men."

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.060
In 2016, she costarred in
[INAUDIBLE] in the Stanford

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.240
Festival of Iranian
Arts, and co-directed--

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:03.073
and directed the documentary
"Dust, Flower, Flame."

00:01:03.073 --> 00:01:05.489
Thank you so much for taking
the time to be here, Shabnam.

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.900
SHABNAM TOLOUEI: Thank you
so much for the invitation.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.590
SPEAKER 1: My first question
is around your experience

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.840
being a female actress
in Iran, and how

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.790
that changed once
you moved to France,

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.105
which is relative liberal
and secular country?

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:24.830
SHABNAM TOLOUEI: First of
all, my second language

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:26.900
is not English.

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.980
It's French, so I see
many Iranian faces here.

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.890
So if I'm in difficulty and
I'm searching for a word,

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.860
I will ask everyone to help me.

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.280
SPEAKER 1: Fair.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.040
SHABNAM TOLOUEI: So I apologize,
because I am just using

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.870
English word to express myself.

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.030
When you're an actress in
Iran, you just have a face.

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.610
You don't have any body.

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.000
Because your body
seems to provoke men,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.560
according to government.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.790
Whatever.

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:05.430
So all the expressions in front
of camera comes from this part.

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.570
You're sad, you're happy.

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.030
Whatever, it happens here.

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.270
Not in your body.

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.580
Your body is covered.

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.270
You don't have the right
to run in front of camera.

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.760
We don't have the
right, as audience,

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.410
to see your body, your--

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:20.080
how can you say?

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.940
How do you say?

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.440
Bumps?

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.300
You don't have the
right to show that.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.180
You are playing the
role of a mother.

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.330
You are seeing your
son after 25 years.

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.700
This is a scenario.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.310
When you see your
son, you faint.

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.210
You can't go toward
him and hug him.

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.220
Because you can't
touch your son,

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.190
the person who is playing
the role of your son.

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.790
You are playing
the role of a wife.

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.380
It's night.

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:53.700
You want to go to bedroom.

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.190
But you don't go to bedroom.

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.470
You lie on sofa in the hall
and your husband go to bedroom.

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.870
You lie down with a scarf.

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.280
We see you sleeping with
a scarf, just this part.

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:14.430
So there are many difficulties
for women, for actresses.

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.360
But when you're living in
Iran, you are used to see that.

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.780
So you imagine-- we have
a very strong imagination

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.540
as an audience.

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.200
So the woman faints.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.480
And you know that, oh OK.

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.220
She's hugging her son.

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.770
The woman is lying on the sofa.

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:36.000
You imagine, oh, OK.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.261
She is making love
with her husband.

00:03:38.261 --> 00:03:38.760
OK.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:39.259
OK.

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:41.310
I see that.

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.580
In theater, it's a
little different.

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.880
Because the audience
is less than

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.700
the audience of TV
series or cinema.

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:56.820
So you feel kind of
freedom as a playwright

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.100
or as a theater director.

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:03.010
So you can see the
body still covered.

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:04.010
But the body movement.

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.250
There is an important
body language when you're

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.450
an actress in theater in Iran.

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.970
And there are many red lines.

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.630
There are many prohibitions
that you cannot cross easily

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:16.470
in Iran.

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.790
Intellectual matters-- this is
not just sexual or whatever.

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:24.180
We have many examples
in Iran of filmmakers

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.420
who are banned to work,
or even they are arrested.

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.820
They are in prison
now because they

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:35.910
wanted to cross the red lines.

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:40.470
When you leave your
country, and when

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.040
you go to a secular country--

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:45.150
first of all, I think this
is not what happened for me.

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:52.120
But I see many actresses go--

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.070
I mean, they accept many
actresses in free countries

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:59.950
except to have naked photos.

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:02.590
Because they are frustrated.

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:07.050
And they want to-- this is some
kind of-- it's some kind of--

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.160
how can I say?

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:10.796
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:05:10.796 --> 00:05:11.790
SPEAKER 2: Rebellion.

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:12.998
SHABNAM TOLOUEI: Rebel-- yes.

00:05:12.998 --> 00:05:14.375
They are-- [INAUDIBLE]?

00:05:14.375 --> 00:05:15.250
SPEAKER 2: Rebellion.

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:16.374
SHABNAM TOLOUEI: Rebellion.

00:05:16.374 --> 00:05:16.900
OK.

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.090
This is kind of rebellion act.

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:24.250
They want to say that I exist,
and I want to show my body,

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:27.651
and I want to be against
those laws, those tradition

00:05:27.651 --> 00:05:28.150
or whatever.

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:37.960
But, for me, the most important
thing was intellectual freedom.

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:43.780
So, I tried to go
to the subjects

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:48.280
that I couldn't talk
about when I was in Iran.

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:51.080
Like two plays that
I had in Paris.

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.040
The play that recently,
weeks ago, a week ago,

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:57.340
I had in Stanford University,
called "Autumn Dance"

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:00.490
that we were seeing the trailer.

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:02.200
Or the film, the
documentary film

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:06.700
that I made about [INAUDIBLE],,
the first woman in Iran

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:13.890
in 170 years ago, the first
woman who unveiled herself.

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:14.560
The poetess.

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.550
And then she was killed.

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:21.130
So this is, I mean, this is--

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:23.320
this is the last part
of your question.

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:26.560
That it helped me a lot
to express myself easily

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:30.410
and to cross these
taboos and red lines.

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:32.060
When I write.

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:33.160
To France.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:34.540
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:35.660
I mean, I can imagine.

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:39.460
But, essentially having the
intellectual freedom now

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:42.620
to express yourself
was really important.

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:45.910
And so then, what was the most
difficult part of immigration,

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:50.375
both as an individual,
but also as a celebrity?

00:06:50.375 --> 00:06:52.750
SHABNAM TOLOUEI: I think when
you leave your country when

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:56.080
you're a kid, it's--

00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:01.610
I mean, it could be easier
than when you are adult,

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:04.730
because even if you are
attached to your friends

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:07.730
or to your neighbors or--

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:11.030
you are in the
beginning of your path.

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:12.980
You have a long way to go.

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:14.660
You are not already someone.

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:17.210
You want to become someone.

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:21.170
But when you have already
a career behind you,

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:23.990
when you are already
someone in your country

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:30.470
and you're forced to leave your
country, which was my case,

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:32.630
the most difficult
part is carrying

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:37.040
on your baggage, the baggage
that you have picked up

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:39.920
throughout the years, you
know, with your souvenirs,

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:42.690
with your love and hate
stories, with your--

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:48.050
with the scent of the
streets, the geography,

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:50.210
the history of your country.

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:55.950
When you arrive to
the new country,

00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:59.300
it prevents you to go forward.

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:01.810
Because all the time
you open this baggage,

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:06.900
and you are comparing
everything with your past.

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:12.740
So, sometimes it even prevents
you to wake up in the morning.

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:15.790
You don't have
enough motivation.

00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:18.860
This was my experience,
my own experience.

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:24.140
And according to what my friends
say, in the same situation,

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:27.290
I see that this is
a common problem.

00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:35.037
So I needed a long time to
get rid of that to go forward.

00:08:35.037 --> 00:08:36.870
SPEAKER 1: And I mean,
I think you're right.

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:38.960
I think a lot of the
challenges you faced

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:42.890
are just the feelings
is what's shared today

00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:45.160
with immigrants and refugees.

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:47.900
What do you think helped you
overcome sort of the feeling

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:50.570
that you just described of
not being able to get up

00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:53.090
or, you know, what provided
you with the resilience

00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:55.719
to overcome over
the couple of years

00:08:55.719 --> 00:08:57.010
that you've been in France now?

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:01.790
SHABNAM TOLOUEI: I
think as a human being,

00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:05.000
I have the right to be
sad, to be depressed,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.660
to be disappointed.

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:07.490
I had been.

00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:13.640
I had serious episode
of deep depression

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:16.220
when I arrived in France.

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:18.230
But I think, in the
same time, I don't

00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:23.540
have the right to stay in
this state of feeling or mind

00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:24.600
or whatever.

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:34.670
So, I try to understand that
it's not important who I was.

00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:37.820
It's important to see what
I can do in the moment,

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:38.690
in this country.

00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:42.530
How can I restart everything?

00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:45.560
It was a very long
process for me.

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:50.390
But maybe this helped me
to overcome everything.

00:09:51.395 --> 00:09:54.110
SPEAKER 1: No, I mean, I think
it's incredibly difficult,

00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:57.800
and ultimately, you know,
as someone who, as you said,

00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:00.140
had a career in
Iran, and you know,

00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:03.050
your artistic expression
was rooted there.

00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:09.110
And sort of the Iranian audience
defining what plays and acting

00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:12.470
and all the things that
you participated in or led,

00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:14.960
how do you think now,
having left Iran,

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:17.060
the Iranian audience
being far away,

00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:20.690
how has that defined
your artistic expression?

00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:26.496
You know, or what
are you leave today?

00:10:26.496 --> 00:10:32.110
SHABNAM TOLOUEI: I think
the connection is not lost.

00:10:35.770 --> 00:10:37.390
Because of the social media.

00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:43.210
There are many, for all of--

00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:45.780
I don't like the word celebrity.

00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:51.820
For celebrities, for actresses,
for actors, for artists.

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:54.730
We can be in connection
with our fans.

00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:58.210
But by fans, I
mean, the audience

00:10:58.210 --> 00:11:03.400
who loves you, who love you, and
who send you positive energy.

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:07.970
And who expect you
to produce something.

00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:11.620
So this is a very
great motivation.

00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:14.250
On the other hand,
you are not updated,

00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:16.660
because you are far
from your country.

00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:22.990
But, there is another positive
point when you are far.

00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:25.850
Because you have a
wider perspective.

00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:29.860
So you can look at
everything in another way.

00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:34.960
Even now, I know, even if I
want to talk about someone

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:42.450
in a village in Iran, I can
talk about this person in a way

00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:46.930
to be understandable
for a wider audience.

00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:48.760
Even for European audience.

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:50.740
Even for American audience.

00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:56.710
Because now I see that there
are many common aspects

00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:58.310
between all human beings.

00:11:58.310 --> 00:11:59.940
This is not being Iranian.

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:02.170
When I want to talk
about Iranian people,

00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:07.040
there is no need to be Iranian
to have Iranian audience.

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:11.740
Another point is that, when
you are outside your country,

00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:13.360
nobody knows you.

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:17.530
Even your-- [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
compatriots?

00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:18.250
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:18.750
Compatriots.

00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:20.620
SHABNAM TOLOUEI: Even
your compatriots.

00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:24.730
So, even if they know you, they
don't-- they have their own

00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:25.300
struggles.

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:27.010
They have their
own daily problems.

00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:34.320
So you need to create
some kind of demand

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:37.800
in the audience to tell
them that, hey, I exist.

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:38.970
I am here.

00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:40.980
And I have something
to share with you.

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:42.670
So please come and read my text.

00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:44.840
Please come and watch my play.

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:48.300
Please, please come
and let's cry together.

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:49.630
Let's laugh together.

00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:55.680
So all the time the artists
who are outside Iran--

00:12:55.680 --> 00:13:00.560
I know many of my friends as
well, they do the same as me.

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:02.747
We are doing [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:02.747 --> 00:13:03.330
How can I say?

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:04.740
Self promotions.

00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:05.910
All the time.

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:07.170
All the time.

00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:08.520
And this helps.

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:13.530
I mean, this helps you
to become demanded,

00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:15.580
wanted in a positive way.

00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:22.140
So, these are the solutions that
you find to keep the connection

00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:25.000
and to create a new
audience outside your--

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.300
SPEAKER 1: And would you say
that, in sort of widening

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:29.520
the audience, as
you said, maybe it's

00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:31.770
not just Iranians,
but Europeans,

00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:34.175
is important for Iranian art?

00:13:34.175 --> 00:13:35.550
SHABNAM TOLOUEI:
I think so, yes.

00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:40.190
It's very important,
because, unfortunately, there

00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:44.100
is kind of stereotype about
Middle Eastern countries

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:45.300
and people.

00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:49.110
So, when you talk
about your country,

00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:51.210
and when you show
what is happening,

00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:52.960
not about politicians
or whatever,

00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:59.460
but you talk about real people,
they see that you are equal.

00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:00.990
We are human beings.

00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:04.890
We are-- and I am
not representative

00:14:04.890 --> 00:14:07.380
of Iranian regime.

00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:10.845
But I am exactly the same as
Chinese actress or whatever.

00:14:10.845 --> 00:14:11.670
You know?

00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:15.030
So, yes, I think it's
very important to break

00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:19.440
these stereotype image.

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:20.460
SPEAKER 1: Absolutely.

00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:23.760
And overall, what has
been important to you

00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:25.392
as an immigrant woman?

00:14:25.392 --> 00:14:25.892
You know?

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:33.000
SHABNAM TOLOUEI: I don't think
that there was anything special

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.870
of being immigrant woman.

00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:40.140
I'm not sure if I were a man--

00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:42.900
you know, I studied
for this phrase.

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:47.180
If I were-- because I thought
that I should say, if I was.

00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:49.380
And then I learned if I were.

00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:56.310
If I were a man, I'm not sure
if it could change anything.

00:14:56.310 --> 00:15:03.450
If more doors could be opened
for me or less doors, you know,

00:15:03.450 --> 00:15:04.970
could be open for me.

00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:10.860
I think the notion of
exile is so difficult.

00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:14.960
When you choose to go to another
country, you are an immigrant.

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:16.900
When you you're forced
to leave your country,

00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:23.100
which was my case, as many other
Iranians after the revolution.

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:29.070
So, even if you are not exiled,
but this notion of exile

00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:30.600
is inside you.

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:32.330
So it's so hard.

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:35.640
It [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:37.440
It's so heavy.

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:39.850
And it doesn't change--

00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:42.584
your gender doesn't
change anything, I think.

00:15:42.584 --> 00:15:43.250
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:44.370
No.

00:15:44.370 --> 00:15:49.290
I think these feelings are
probably transcending a lot of,

00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:52.170
you know, whether it's gender
or occupation, in the sense

00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:55.560
that it's so deep and hard
to come to terms with.

00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:57.750
So, how does one
come to terms with--

00:15:57.750 --> 00:15:59.520
I guess, one of
my final questions

00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:02.130
is, how do you stay resilient?

00:16:02.130 --> 00:16:05.430
And what would-- if you
have any insights or advice

00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:09.369
or something that you can share,
just how do you stay positive?

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:15.750
SHABNAM TOLOUEI: Huh.

00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:16.890
This is a very--

00:16:16.890 --> 00:16:19.510
how to stay positive.

00:16:19.510 --> 00:16:23.294
I think this is a question
from the beginning of time.

00:16:23.294 --> 00:16:23.960
SPEAKER 1: True.

00:16:26.650 --> 00:16:29.610
SHABNAM TOLOUEI:
You know, let me say

00:16:29.610 --> 00:16:33.840
why I was forced to leave Iran.

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:37.390
Because after that,
I can answer, maybe,

00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:38.320
better your question.

00:16:41.970 --> 00:16:44.920
The artists, and
especially the artists

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:47.090
in the field of cinema
and theater in Iran

00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:50.280
are the representative
of Islamic society.

00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:55.550
So if you are not Muslim,
you will be in trouble.

00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:57.050
I'm not Muslim.

00:16:57.050 --> 00:16:57.590
I'm Baha'i.

00:16:57.590 --> 00:17:02.820
As a Baha'i-- you can
Google what is Baha'i.

00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:05.339
I don't want to talk about
Baha'i beliefs or whatever.

00:17:05.339 --> 00:17:06.937
But as Baha'i, when
you are Baha'i,

00:17:06.937 --> 00:17:08.770
you say that I am Baha'i
when you are asked.

00:17:08.770 --> 00:17:10.426
You don't deny your beliefs.

00:17:10.426 --> 00:17:12.300
When you deny your
beliefs, it means that you

00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:13.619
are not-- you are not Baha'i.

00:17:13.619 --> 00:17:14.609
[INAUDIBLE]

00:17:14.609 --> 00:17:15.550
Finished.

00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:20.040
So I was playing in
a famous TV series.

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:25.470
And then, there's a
famous questionnaire

00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:31.320
that must be filled by
all the artists in Iran.

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:37.710
Especially the artists who
work with the national TV.

00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:39.180
The first question is your name.

00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:41.410
The second one is
your family name.

00:17:41.410 --> 00:17:43.770
The third one is
your father's name.

00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:45.660
No mother's name is needed.

00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:47.340
Just father's name.

00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:50.590
And then the fourth
question is your religion.

00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:52.410
I wrote Baha'i.

00:17:52.410 --> 00:17:55.470
And then, the person
who was the agent

00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:59.370
of security service, the
intelligence service,

00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:01.440
he took back the questionnaire.

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:03.420
He looked at it.

00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:05.530
His eyes were shining.

00:18:05.530 --> 00:18:06.060
You know?

00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:07.421
I was the fish in the trap.

00:18:07.421 --> 00:18:07.920
You know?

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:09.600
He was so happy about that.

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:14.610
And since he knew that, OK,
this is the last day of my work,

00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:18.060
he asked me to take a selfie
with him for his family.

00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:19.140
So we did that.

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:21.480
And then, I was called
by the intelligence

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:23.010
service or whatever.

00:18:23.010 --> 00:18:25.560
So they were very angry.

00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:28.510
And they were saying, oh,
where were you all these years?

00:18:28.510 --> 00:18:30.830
And why didn't we know
that you are Baha'i?

00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:33.990
And now you need to convert
to Islam, because you will

00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:37.110
be the example of whatever.

00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:39.050
And I was saying,
no, please, please.

00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:40.920
Let me work, let me work.

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:44.070
Because I'm not teaching
anything about Baha'i faith or

00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:47.280
I'm not, whatever.

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:48.680
And I just want to work.

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:50.340
But, I'm Baha'i.

00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:51.960
Anyway, they didn't accept it.

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:54.300
And it took two years.

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:55.360
It was very hard.

00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:58.740
I was called every
time to the security--

00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:00.750
I mean, we call it
security service,

00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:03.540
and it is the intelligence
service in Iran.

00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:06.940
So, this was my choice.

00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:09.390
I could have chosen
another thing.

00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:13.980
I could have chosen
to write, I'm Muslim.

00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:18.960
And I could have stayed in
Iran and continue my career.

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:23.910
I did something which, according
to many of my friends, even

00:19:23.910 --> 00:19:26.970
my child, who is eight
years old, is not wise.

00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:28.590
But I did that.

00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:32.660
And then, I had to
accept the consequences.

00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:35.440
It was very, very hard.

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:40.440
I could not even imagine that it
could be this much hard for me.

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:41.430
It was very hard.

00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:44.980
This is why when I arrived
in Paris, I was lost.

00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:50.550
I didn't know who I am,
where I am, why I am there.

00:19:50.550 --> 00:19:54.720
And I had a serious depression.

00:19:54.720 --> 00:20:01.320
But, since I believe
strongly, even now,

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:05.380
in personal responsibility.

00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:09.930
So, I try to overcome
my depression and all

00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:13.290
these mental and psychological
and social difficulties.

00:20:13.290 --> 00:20:14.820
I said, OK.

00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:17.950
I chose something.

00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:18.930
This is my--

00:20:18.930 --> 00:20:23.520
I mean, at that time, that
was the best choice, according

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:27.030
to my beliefs, according
to my personal identity,

00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:30.160
according to my self-esteem,
to my personal image.

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:32.040
So now, I accept it.

00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:33.930
And now, I should go forward.

00:20:33.930 --> 00:20:37.050
And then, one day I
woke up, and I said, OK.

00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:38.970
Now, rebirth.

00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:40.350
There is another Shabnam.

00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:43.110
That one doesn't exist anymore.

00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:46.590
There are lots of beautiful
souvenirs from her.

00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:49.590
We can Google her and
what she has done in Iran.

00:20:49.590 --> 00:20:50.630
But that's finished.

00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:54.870
Now, what do you want
to do here, in Paris?

00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:58.920
How do you want to connect to
this society, to these people,

00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:01.650
to understand why this
street has this name?

00:21:01.650 --> 00:21:03.450
What is behind this?

00:21:03.450 --> 00:21:05.730
What is behind these smiles?

00:21:05.730 --> 00:21:10.290
What is behind this behavior
in the subways or whatever?

00:21:10.290 --> 00:21:13.350
To understand the people
who are surrounding you.

00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:19.710
And I think this is, for
me, I mean, in one word,

00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:25.770
to be brief, to take
the responsibility.

00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:29.670
And then to stay in
the present moment

00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:35.425
was two keys that helped me to
open the door of my new life.

00:21:35.425 --> 00:21:37.800
SPEAKER 1: And, you know, I
love this word that you used,

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:39.480
rebirth.

00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:43.950
And it sounds like there was a
transformation of your identity

00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:46.530
almost at this point.

00:21:46.530 --> 00:21:50.670
What do you think, are today how
you define your identity today?

00:21:50.670 --> 00:21:51.790
And how it's different?

00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:53.940
How is it different
from the Shabnam

00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:55.350
before that we can Google?

00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:01.370
SHABNAM TOLOUEI: You still
can Google just career.

00:22:01.370 --> 00:22:05.760
And we don't talk
about my identity.

00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:09.620
When you are in a
country like Iran,

00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:14.120
with a dominant
tradition, a regime that

00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:18.140
tries to decide for you--

00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:19.340
[INAUDIBLE]

00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:20.810
SPEAKER 1: Patriarchy?

00:22:20.810 --> 00:22:22.396
Patriarchy.

00:22:22.396 --> 00:22:23.270
SHABNAM TOLOUEI: Yes.

00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:25.410
What, these friends said.

00:22:25.410 --> 00:22:26.420
Yes.

00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:29.150
The power of father,
the power of men.

00:22:29.150 --> 00:22:31.890
Even women don't--

00:22:31.890 --> 00:22:34.520
I mean, even, yes.

00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:37.340
In their psychology,
they have this,

00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:39.980
I mean, this notion
that men have the right,

00:22:39.980 --> 00:22:41.330
even if they object.

00:22:41.330 --> 00:22:45.270
But inside their minds,
they think this way.

00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:52.700
So the elements that you choose
to construct your identity

00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:57.320
is somehow forced by tradition,
by family, by regime,

00:22:57.320 --> 00:22:59.900
by propaganda.

00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:02.760
Even by suppression.

00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:05.540
You resist for something
that you're not sure

00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:07.190
if you have the choice.

00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:11.450
Will you choose the same?

00:23:11.450 --> 00:23:15.650
The same way, even to
resist, or whatever?

00:23:15.650 --> 00:23:17.690
When you are forced--

00:23:17.690 --> 00:23:23.930
I mean, I emphasize the word
"forced" to leave the country--

00:23:23.930 --> 00:23:28.655
and you land in a new country.

00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:34.220
Suddenly you wake up.

00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:38.970
And you say, who I am?

00:23:38.970 --> 00:23:40.910
What is my real identity?

00:23:40.910 --> 00:23:44.510
And you question all the
beliefs and the elements

00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:50.000
that has built your self-image.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.130
Your social identity.

00:23:52.130 --> 00:23:55.100
Even your sexual identity.

00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:58.130
I talk to many Iranians, and
they had the same experience.

00:23:58.130 --> 00:24:02.150
They said, yes when we
were-- as an adult, I say.

00:24:02.150 --> 00:24:04.820
When we arrive to,
for example, France,

00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:08.510
we started questioning
ourselves if whether I'm

00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:10.890
a homosexual or not.

00:24:10.890 --> 00:24:13.580
Because you are not
sure if, you know--

00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:17.210
you are free now to
be whatever you are,

00:24:17.210 --> 00:24:19.900
or to choose whatever
you want to be.

00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:22.040
But in Iran, it's not the same.

00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:25.400
Even there isn't any
regime that suppress you.

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:27.680
This is a family.

00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:30.450
You're scared to be
yourself, you know?

00:24:30.450 --> 00:24:36.580
So, I had all these
questions about my identity.

00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:40.000
And then, religious identity.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.090
Why have I chosen to be Baha'i?

00:24:43.090 --> 00:24:44.920
Were I influenced by my father?

00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:48.460
Because I was born
in a mixed family.

00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:50.560
Part of my family are Muslims.

00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:54.500
Part are-- my paternal--
is it paternal?

00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:57.340
Paternal part are Baha'is.

00:24:57.340 --> 00:24:59.650
So I chose to be Baha'i.

00:24:59.650 --> 00:25:00.920
But I'm not--

00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:05.240
I mean, I started questioning
myself that, have I really--

00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:07.420
have I really
chosen to be Baha'i?

00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:10.030
Or was I influenced
by my father?

00:25:10.030 --> 00:25:16.610
Or am I really the
person that I am now?

00:25:16.610 --> 00:25:23.290
Have I really found my
place in the society?

00:25:23.290 --> 00:25:27.460
Or didn't I have
any other option?

00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:31.690
So this is why I became
an actress or whatever.

00:25:31.690 --> 00:25:34.150
Am I not lesbian?

00:25:34.150 --> 00:25:36.960
Because I had problems in
my love, in my love story.

00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:38.740
So what is happening?

00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:40.090
All these questions.

00:25:40.090 --> 00:25:44.230
And then, I started to
rebuild my identity.

00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:50.740
Finally, in a free country, I
understood that even if I am--

00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:54.740
I have to-- I mean, I didn't
have any choice to be a woman.

00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:57.250
But, I think this
is not important.

00:25:57.250 --> 00:26:00.850
Gender, religion, or
nationality or whatever.

00:26:00.850 --> 00:26:02.260
I'm a human being.

00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:03.960
This is the most
important part, you

00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:06.400
know, for me, of my identity.

00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:09.690
This is what, you know, this
is a short time, a human being.

00:26:09.690 --> 00:26:12.280
So you can't find any
movie [INAUDIBLE]..

00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:16.060
But this is why I--

00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:19.720
this is what-- this is the gift
of this immigration for me.

00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:21.620
That I could get
rid of everything.

00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:25.600
And then I choose
again what I want.

00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:31.540
But I see that there is kind of
essence of a human being that

00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:34.120
is most important thing.

00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:37.520
I mean, more important
than all these elements.

00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:40.205
So, was I clear?

00:26:40.205 --> 00:26:40.830
SPEAKER 1: Yes.

00:26:40.830 --> 00:26:41.568
SHABNAM TOLOUEI: OK, thank you.

00:26:41.568 --> 00:26:42.651
SPEAKER 1: Yes, very much.

00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:47.800
And my final question--
and it's a bit grand.

00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:50.595
But what's the secret
to a happy life?

00:26:50.595 --> 00:26:51.720
SHABNAM TOLOUEI: Oh my god.

00:26:54.109 --> 00:26:55.400
SPEAKER 1: I said it was grand.

00:27:01.570 --> 00:27:07.300
SHABNAM TOLOUEI: You know, this
is a philosophical question.

00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:09.230
Again, since the
beginning of time.

00:27:09.230 --> 00:27:10.210
There are many answers.

00:27:14.490 --> 00:27:20.970
Many people say that no
expectation, whatever.

00:27:20.970 --> 00:27:23.370
I was talking to
a friend a couple

00:27:23.370 --> 00:27:26.640
of weeks ago about happiness.

00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:29.250
And I'm just repeating
what I heard,

00:27:29.250 --> 00:27:31.110
because I liked that so much.

00:27:31.110 --> 00:27:32.860
Because I'm searching as well.

00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:36.360
And, according to
this friend, when

00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:41.580
you are in search of
happiness, you are lost.

00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:44.310
Because happiness
is not outside.

00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:47.070
Happiness is
something inside you.

00:27:47.070 --> 00:27:50.610
So, if you are in
peace with yourself,

00:27:50.610 --> 00:27:52.740
you're happy everyday.

00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:54.740
For me, it was fantastic.

00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:59.070
I'm not sure if I ever arrived
to this point, or how far am I.

00:27:59.070 --> 00:28:02.040
But I hope some day,
I stop searching.

00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:05.070
And I can open my heart and
see, oh, everything is here,

00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:07.605
everything is here,
everything is here.

00:28:07.605 --> 00:28:09.930
SPEAKER 3: So your
latest play at Stanford,

00:28:09.930 --> 00:28:12.370
you were acting
as three persons.

00:28:12.370 --> 00:28:14.406
And both were involved
in a situation

00:28:14.406 --> 00:28:15.530
that they had to immigrate.

00:28:15.530 --> 00:28:17.040
Someone was in prison.

00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:18.810
Can you go over
that and you say--

00:28:18.810 --> 00:28:23.760
you explain how it was
based off of your own story?

00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:26.370
Or it was inspired by that.

00:28:29.114 --> 00:28:30.780
SHABNAM TOLOUEI: Yes,
in "Autumn Dance,"

00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:36.090
there are three women who
are experiencing exile,

00:28:36.090 --> 00:28:38.550
even if they are in
their own country.

00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:43.350
There is a journalist,
in Iran, in prison.

00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:47.280
There is a prostitute
in Paris, who

00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:51.510
pretends to be a
journalist, because she has

00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:54.210
met this journalist in Iran.

00:28:54.210 --> 00:28:57.180
So she wants to ask for--

00:28:57.180 --> 00:28:58.140
asylum?

00:28:58.140 --> 00:28:59.250
Asylum.

00:28:59.250 --> 00:29:06.120
And there is another woman, the
sister of this real journalist,

00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:10.440
who has left Iran
when she was 18.

00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:12.570
She was imprisoned in Iran.

00:29:12.570 --> 00:29:15.700
And now she is a dance teacher,
dance professor in Paris.

00:29:20.130 --> 00:29:26.310
There was, in 2009, there
was a green movement in Iran.

00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:31.260
Because of this false result
of elections when Ahmadinejad

00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:34.140
was reelected in Iran.

00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:37.320
There was a green movement,
and many, many journalists

00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:38.970
were arrested in Iran.

00:29:38.970 --> 00:29:43.590
Many young people who
were demonstrating outside

00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:46.080
were killed.

00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:52.080
So, I was inspired by this
green movement in Iran.

00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:56.880
And the protests
of Iranian youth.

00:29:56.880 --> 00:30:00.450
And I wrote this
play, based on what

00:30:00.450 --> 00:30:08.610
I have heard about the
tortures in Iranian prisons

00:30:08.610 --> 00:30:12.680
since the beginning
of the revolution.

00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:18.840
And the personal experiences of
the women who were in prison,

00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:22.850
who were raped in prisons,
who were touched in prisons,

00:30:22.850 --> 00:30:27.990
sexually abused just to
confess to what they were not.

00:30:27.990 --> 00:30:34.220
So, and then, in
2009, with this wave

00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:38.360
of immigration,
many intellectuals,

00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:40.560
again, left Iran.

00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:43.760
And there were many
people who didn't really

00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:45.470
have problems in Iran.

00:30:45.470 --> 00:30:49.580
But they left Iran just to take
advantage of the situation.

00:30:49.580 --> 00:30:54.510
And they tried to pretend
that they are someone else.

00:30:54.510 --> 00:31:00.680
So all these matters
helped me, or made me,

00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:06.390
to write "Autumn
Dance" and to play it.

00:31:06.390 --> 00:31:08.340
SPEAKER 1: Great.

00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:10.620
In your documentary,
"Dust, Flower, Flame,"

00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:12.570
you described the
life of a 19th century

00:31:12.570 --> 00:31:16.170
woman who impacted the Iranian
women's rights movement.

00:31:16.170 --> 00:31:18.990
Do you feel like the Iranian--
the Iran's women's rights

00:31:18.990 --> 00:31:21.492
movement is progressing
or regressing?

00:31:21.492 --> 00:31:22.700
SHABNAM TOLOUEI: Progressing.

00:31:22.700 --> 00:31:23.940
Of course.

00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:24.520
Of course.

00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:31.000
I don't know the
exact percentage,

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:37.540
but I think it's more than
60% of Iranian students who

00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:38.860
are women.

00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:44.740
We have many physicians, many
engineers, many scientists

00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:47.050
in Iran who are women.

00:31:47.050 --> 00:31:50.560
In Iran, we forget that
we are wearing scarf.

00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:52.150
We completely forget it.

00:31:52.150 --> 00:31:52.780
You know?

00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:58.260
And when we are outside Iran,
we say, oh, women in Iran are--

00:31:58.260 --> 00:32:00.270
they have to put scarves.

00:32:00.270 --> 00:32:02.690
And this is kind of obliga--

00:32:02.690 --> 00:32:04.390
this is kind of obligation.

00:32:04.390 --> 00:32:08.930
But it doesn't prevent
Iranian women to progress.

00:32:08.930 --> 00:32:09.430
You know?

00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:15.840
So, this is exactly the reason
that I chose this subject,

00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:17.260
[INAUDIBLE].

00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:25.620
Because I saw that Iranian women
are trying to cross the taboos,

00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:27.610
to progress.

00:32:27.610 --> 00:32:31.070
And to say what they want.

00:32:31.070 --> 00:32:34.420
This was not the case
during the first years

00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:36.160
after the revolution
because of war

00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:38.650
and many, many other problems.

00:32:38.650 --> 00:32:43.920
But when I read in internet--

00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:48.610
I'm still reading-- what they
are doing, and how many women--

00:32:48.610 --> 00:32:55.500
Muslim women-- who were against
the [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]..

00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:57.550
Injust?

00:32:57.550 --> 00:32:58.360
Injustice.

00:32:58.360 --> 00:33:00.700
Injustice in Iran toward women.

00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:01.560
They were arrested.

00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:02.450
I thought that, OK.

00:33:02.450 --> 00:33:05.800
This is the time to
talk about [INAUDIBLE]..

00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:09.020
And to say that,
OK, 170 years ago,

00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:10.780
something happened exactly.

00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:16.690
And you won't need to
be executed like her.

00:33:16.690 --> 00:33:21.910
So the path is
open now, I think.

00:33:21.910 --> 00:33:23.480
SPEAKER 1: It's great.

00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:25.496
Do we have a question?

00:33:25.496 --> 00:33:28.480
SPEAKER 4: Oh, thank you
for your interesting talk.

00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:31.640
As you already said,
many leave our country,

00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:33.340
we leave everything behind.

00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:38.330
And for example, for us,
our resume becomes empty.

00:33:38.330 --> 00:33:43.390
And so, for example,
there is a feeling

00:33:43.390 --> 00:33:46.790
that we want to prove
ourselves to the other people.

00:33:46.790 --> 00:33:50.650
So, what did you do to
overcome this feeling?

00:33:56.430 --> 00:34:00.540
SHABNAM TOLOUEI: I remember
when I was in Iran.

00:34:00.540 --> 00:34:07.650
We were traveling most of
the time for our shows,

00:34:07.650 --> 00:34:10.530
for our theater performances.

00:34:10.530 --> 00:34:14.489
It was organized by
Iranian government.

00:34:14.489 --> 00:34:18.719
And just the day
before our departure,

00:34:18.719 --> 00:34:22.080
we were searching for
this handcraft Iranian,

00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:25.380
you know, souvenirs, gifts,
to take with ourselves,

00:34:25.380 --> 00:34:29.219
to show the European people that
we are the most generous people

00:34:29.219 --> 00:34:30.179
in the world.

00:34:30.179 --> 00:34:33.449
And then, we were talking
about our civilization.

00:34:33.449 --> 00:34:36.360
It began in 2,500 years ago.

00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:37.920
And we have that,
and we have this.

00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:40.350
And then, [INAUDIBLE] appeared.

00:34:40.350 --> 00:34:42.690
So, you know, [INAUDIBLE]
is an Iranian.

00:34:42.690 --> 00:34:43.199
You know?

00:34:43.199 --> 00:34:48.550
All the time, we were
trying to say that, I mean,

00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:50.429
I am not the person
that you think.

00:34:50.429 --> 00:34:52.409
I am not the stereotype.

00:34:52.409 --> 00:34:53.130
You know?

00:34:53.130 --> 00:34:58.650
But, when I lost
everything, and when

00:34:58.650 --> 00:35:04.780
I started to have a
new life in Paris,

00:35:04.780 --> 00:35:07.080
I thought that there's no need.

00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:08.680
There is no need to do that.

00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:14.930
We have our civilization,
or whatever,

00:35:14.930 --> 00:35:17.200
which is very fantastic.

00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:19.270
But who are we now?

00:35:19.270 --> 00:35:20.680
And who I am now?

00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:23.420
I need many things to
learn from this country.

00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:28.330
So there's no need
to fight to show

00:35:28.330 --> 00:35:30.400
that I am an
established character

00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:32.170
and whatever, you know?

00:35:32.170 --> 00:35:34.120
SPEAKER 4: Not as an Iranian.

00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:37.250
As Shabnam, for
example, as a celebrity,

00:35:37.250 --> 00:35:41.500
this feeling is much,
much worse, for example,

00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:42.790
as nobody knows you.

00:35:42.790 --> 00:35:43.800
Nobody knows your work.

00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:48.280
So, as Shabnam, what did
you do to prove yourself

00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:50.480
that you were a celebrity?

00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:53.620
You were-- [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:53.620 --> 00:35:54.820
SHABNAM TOLOUEI: Nothing.

00:35:54.820 --> 00:35:55.420
SPEAKER 4: Nothing.

00:35:55.420 --> 00:35:56.461
SHABNAM TOLOUEI: Nothing.

00:35:56.461 --> 00:36:02.740
During-- I left Iran
in 2004, December 2004.

00:36:02.740 --> 00:36:07.190
Till 2007, I was doing nothing.

00:36:07.190 --> 00:36:10.210
I remember, I was going
to language school.

00:36:10.210 --> 00:36:12.640
And this was just a
simple question, just

00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:15.550
to make you talk in French.

00:36:15.550 --> 00:36:20.890
So, who are you and
what do you want to be?

00:36:20.890 --> 00:36:22.930
Because the others were young--

00:36:22.930 --> 00:36:24.470
many young people.

00:36:24.470 --> 00:36:31.310
And I was saying, I
was working in theater.

00:36:31.310 --> 00:36:32.950
What was I doing?

00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:36.820
No details.

00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:40.011
So they could imagine that I
was working in administration

00:36:40.011 --> 00:36:40.510
or whatever.

00:36:40.510 --> 00:36:42.130
I was working in theater.

00:36:42.130 --> 00:36:44.470
What are you going to be?

00:36:44.470 --> 00:36:45.830
I don't know.

00:36:45.830 --> 00:36:46.881
I'm just studying French.

00:36:46.881 --> 00:36:47.380
You know?

00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:49.000
I really didn't know.

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.190
And I was so shy.

00:36:51.190 --> 00:36:53.860
I was too shy to
explain who I was.

00:36:53.860 --> 00:36:55.720
I was really lost.

00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:58.370
So I didn't even try
to talk about myself.

00:36:58.370 --> 00:37:02.561
Then, miraculously?

00:37:02.561 --> 00:37:05.610
[INAUDIBLE] appeared.

00:37:05.610 --> 00:37:09.100
And she wanted me
to play in her film.

00:37:09.100 --> 00:37:15.560
And then, I started
to talk about myself,

00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:17.230
around me, to my friends.

00:37:17.230 --> 00:37:18.270
And you know?

00:37:21.670 --> 00:37:23.530
I started to work.

00:37:23.530 --> 00:37:24.980
Then I started to work.

00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:28.210
I went to Germany for a play.

00:37:28.210 --> 00:37:30.970
I stayed there for two years.

00:37:30.970 --> 00:37:33.505
So, I started to work.

00:37:33.505 --> 00:37:39.400
And just by my works, I tried
to show the audience, not

00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:40.150
the people--

00:37:40.150 --> 00:37:42.330
I mean, not the power--

00:37:42.330 --> 00:37:44.470
just the audience that I exist.

00:37:44.470 --> 00:37:46.000
And please, please come.

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.740
I have something
to share with you.

00:37:47.740 --> 00:37:49.291
This is what I did.

00:37:49.291 --> 00:37:51.790
SPEAKER 1: And what has been
the greatest challenge you have

00:37:51.790 --> 00:37:55.450
faced in your career to date?

00:37:55.450 --> 00:37:57.910
SHABNAM TOLOUEI: Every time
that I want to go on stage--

00:37:57.910 --> 00:38:03.730
for me, this is my great
challenge, you know?

00:38:03.730 --> 00:38:05.380
I am like a child.

00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:08.740
I start from the point of zero.

00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:09.930
I am excited.

00:38:09.930 --> 00:38:13.700
I'm nervous.

00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:18.010
I think that I
can't do anything.

00:38:18.010 --> 00:38:20.810
And this is a big challenge
for me every time.

00:38:20.810 --> 00:38:25.150
So I can't mention
a particular event

00:38:25.150 --> 00:38:29.244
that this was my
great challenge.

00:38:29.244 --> 00:38:30.410
SPEAKER 1: So, stage fright?

00:38:30.410 --> 00:38:32.116
Do you get--

00:38:32.116 --> 00:38:32.990
SHABNAM TOLOUEI: Yes.

00:38:32.990 --> 00:38:33.771
SPEAKER 1: I can--

00:38:33.771 --> 00:38:35.895
SHABNAM TOLOUEI: And after
five minutes, I feel OK.

00:38:35.895 --> 00:38:37.035
And then--

00:38:37.035 --> 00:38:37.910
SPEAKER 1: Breathing.

00:38:37.910 --> 00:38:40.780
SHABNAM TOLOUEI: I go forward.

00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:41.736
SPEAKER 1: Question?

00:38:41.736 --> 00:38:42.360
SPEAKER 5: Yes.

00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:44.260
I have a two-part question.

00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:47.140
As a multi-lingual
person, sometimes we

00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:50.080
have different personalities
depending on the language

00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:52.930
that we speak.

00:38:52.930 --> 00:38:57.190
How did you consolidate
these distractions

00:38:57.190 --> 00:39:03.120
or different forces that
internally you have?

00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:05.137
Or you may not have?

00:39:05.137 --> 00:39:06.720
SHABNAM TOLOUEI: I
don't know, really.

00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:07.406
You know?

00:39:07.406 --> 00:39:11.340
It's about 13 years that
I'm living in France.

00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:16.860
Maybe I have, you know, I
have become another person

00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:20.440
with a mixture of
gestures or characters.

00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:21.150
I don't know.

00:39:21.150 --> 00:39:24.990
Because when my friends come
from Iran and stay in my house,

00:39:24.990 --> 00:39:27.660
they say, oh Shabnam,
you have changed a lot.

00:39:27.660 --> 00:39:30.450
I don't understand
that, you know?

00:39:30.450 --> 00:39:35.990
But I'm so much influenced by
the society that I'm living in.

00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:39.640
And by the language and by
body language, you know?

00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:43.085
So, that's interesting.

00:39:43.085 --> 00:39:44.460
What you say,
that's interesting.

00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:47.130
But I never, you know--

00:39:47.130 --> 00:39:49.666
I was not aware about that.

00:39:49.666 --> 00:39:52.540
SPEAKER 5: Thank you.

00:39:52.540 --> 00:39:54.795
SPEAKER 6: But your
son was born in Paris.

00:39:54.795 --> 00:39:55.710
SHABNAM TOLOUEI: Yes.

00:39:55.710 --> 00:39:57.600
SPEAKER 6: And he's French.

00:39:57.600 --> 00:40:00.490
So, how do you deal with that?

00:40:00.490 --> 00:40:02.430
I mean, what's the feeling?

00:40:02.430 --> 00:40:03.630
You had a life.

00:40:03.630 --> 00:40:07.960
And how do you
explain it to him?

00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:08.670
He's a kid.

00:40:08.670 --> 00:40:10.800
But he also needs
to know, because he

00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:14.615
sees your challenges.

00:40:14.615 --> 00:40:15.490
SHABNAM TOLOUEI: Yes.

00:40:18.780 --> 00:40:21.540
My son is eight years now.

00:40:21.540 --> 00:40:25.560
He was 3 and 1/2,
and he was in school.

00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:29.520
I went to take him from school.

00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:33.090
And he started crying
when he saw me.

00:40:33.090 --> 00:40:34.950
And he said, you know Paul--

00:40:34.950 --> 00:40:36.810
his friend-- has broken my--

00:40:36.810 --> 00:40:37.920
whatever.

00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:40.140
And I said, oh, this
is the third time.

00:40:40.140 --> 00:40:40.770
But why?

00:40:40.770 --> 00:40:42.300
Why is he did this much?

00:40:42.300 --> 00:40:43.370
You know, why?

00:40:43.370 --> 00:40:44.370
And why did he do that?

00:40:44.370 --> 00:40:45.930
I went to Paul.

00:40:45.930 --> 00:40:48.340
And I said, Paul,
why did you do that?

00:40:48.340 --> 00:40:49.470
And he said, no, no, no.

00:40:49.470 --> 00:40:50.620
It was not me this time.

00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:52.380
It was him.

00:40:52.380 --> 00:40:55.810
And I went to my son, and
I said, did you lie to me?

00:40:55.810 --> 00:40:59.760
And he was so happy because, you
know, he had found a solution.

00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:02.430
So he started to lie.

00:41:02.430 --> 00:41:05.880
So he said, yes, yes I lied.

00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:07.860
And then I said, OK.

00:41:07.860 --> 00:41:09.460
You have your snack.

00:41:09.460 --> 00:41:11.820
And then we sit and we talk.

00:41:11.820 --> 00:41:14.640
And then I told him my story.

00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:19.120
I said, you know, I was
in Iran and I [INAUDIBLE]..

00:41:19.120 --> 00:41:22.090
And I told the truth.

00:41:22.090 --> 00:41:24.510
And I was fired.

00:41:24.510 --> 00:41:26.250
And now I am here.

00:41:26.250 --> 00:41:28.470
And he said, oh my god.

00:41:28.470 --> 00:41:30.200
But you could have lied.

00:41:33.665 --> 00:41:38.460
And I said, yes, but, I didn't.

00:41:38.460 --> 00:41:44.490
So I just want you to tell
the truth all the time

00:41:44.490 --> 00:41:47.730
and to take the responsibility
of the consequences.

00:41:47.730 --> 00:41:49.660
And since then, it
was very interesting.

00:41:49.660 --> 00:41:54.000
He said-- he used
a bad word for me.

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.560
I mean, he said,
{?_{?_[SPEAKING FRENCH]._?}._?} It

00:41:56.560 --> 00:41:58.170
means that you're crazy.

00:41:58.170 --> 00:41:59.940
Stupid.

00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:04.170
But since then, he
tells the truth.

00:42:04.170 --> 00:42:05.400
He tells everything.

00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:07.740
And now, I have to tell
him that there is no need

00:42:07.740 --> 00:42:10.320
to tell everything, you know?

00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:11.610
There are some secrets.

00:42:11.610 --> 00:42:14.220
Please keep at least my secrets.

00:42:14.220 --> 00:42:15.550
But he tells the truth.

00:42:15.550 --> 00:42:19.820
Even if something bad happens,
and he say, Mom, I did that.

00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:21.120
But OK.

00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:23.110
I accepted the consequences.

00:42:23.110 --> 00:42:27.660
So, this is the only lesson
that I can bring from my past,

00:42:27.660 --> 00:42:28.820
you know, for him.

00:42:28.820 --> 00:42:32.460
Otherwise, I try to adapt
myself to his situation.

00:42:32.460 --> 00:42:35.190
Because as you say, he's
a French, you know, child.

00:42:35.190 --> 00:42:38.400
So I need to see
what is happening

00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:41.160
for him in this society.

00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:42.870
I need to go to his school.

00:42:42.870 --> 00:42:45.690
I need to accompany him
in different events.

00:42:45.690 --> 00:42:48.120
And you know, he
takes me with him.

00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:49.530
SPEAKER 6: So it
was benediction.

00:42:49.530 --> 00:42:50.405
SHABNAM TOLOUEI: Yes.

00:42:50.405 --> 00:42:51.120
Yes, of course.

00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:51.619
Yes.

00:42:51.619 --> 00:42:52.640
To help me to--

00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:58.935
yes, to live in the
present moment with him.

00:42:58.935 --> 00:42:59.439
Thank you.

00:42:59.439 --> 00:43:01.230
SPEAKER 1: Well thank
you so much, Shabnam.

00:43:01.230 --> 00:43:03.970
I know some of these memories
are not easy to relive.

00:43:03.970 --> 00:43:04.980
So, thank you.

00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:06.105
Thank you for being here.

00:43:06.105 --> 00:43:06.730
Thank you for--

00:43:06.730 --> 00:43:07.500
SHABNAM TOLOUEI:
Thank you so much.

00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:09.004
Thank you for your invitation.

00:43:09.004 --> 00:43:10.170
Thank you for your patience.

00:43:10.170 --> 00:43:11.430
Thank you.

00:43:11.430 --> 00:43:16.280
