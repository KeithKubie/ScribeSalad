- [Instructor] Let r be the
function given by r of theta

00:00:02.955 --> 00:00:06.287
is equal to three theta sine
theta for theta is between

00:00:06.287 --> 00:00:08.829
zero and two pie,
including zero and two pie.

00:00:08.829 --> 00:00:10.739
The graph of r in polar
coordinates consists

00:00:10.739 --> 00:00:14.354
of two loops, as shown
in the figure above.

00:00:14.354 --> 00:00:15.899
So let's think about why it has two loops.

00:00:15.899 --> 00:00:20.060
So as our theta, when
theta is zero, r is zero,

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.220
and then as our theta increases,

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.898
we start tracing out this first loop,

00:00:24.898 --> 00:00:28.791
all the way until when
theta's equal to pie.

00:00:28.791 --> 00:00:30.860
So we've traced out this first loop

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.410
from theta's equal to zero
to theta's equal to pie.

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.748
And then the second loop has a larger r,

00:00:37.748 --> 00:00:39.432
so these are larger r's, this is when

00:00:39.432 --> 00:00:41.914
we're going from pie to two pie.

00:00:41.914 --> 00:00:44.669
And you might say, "Well why
doesn't it show up down here?"

00:00:44.669 --> 00:00:48.067
Well, between sine of
pie and sine of two pie,

00:00:48.067 --> 00:00:50.153
this part right over here
is going to be negative,

00:00:50.153 --> 00:00:52.524
so it flips it over, the r onto this side.

00:00:52.524 --> 00:00:53.933
And the magnitude of the r is larger

00:00:53.933 --> 00:00:55.999
and larger because of this three theta.

00:00:55.999 --> 00:00:57.565
And so when we go from pie to two pie,

00:00:57.565 --> 00:01:01.028
we trace out the larger
circle, fair enough,

00:01:01.028 --> 00:01:03.355
that seems pretty straightforward.

00:01:03.355 --> 00:01:06.207
Point P is on the graph of r,

00:01:06.207 --> 00:01:08.892
right over there, and the y-axis.

00:01:08.892 --> 00:01:11.283
Find the rate of change
of the x-coordinate

00:01:11.283 --> 00:01:14.852
with respect to theta at the point P.

00:01:14.852 --> 00:01:16.612
Alright, so let's think
about this a little bit.

00:01:16.612 --> 00:01:18.310
They don't give us x
as a function of theta.

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.594
We have to figure out that
from what they've given us.

00:01:21.594 --> 00:01:24.911
So just as a bit of a polar
coordinates refresher,

00:01:24.911 --> 00:01:28.224
if this is our theta, right over there,

00:01:28.224 --> 00:01:30.830
this is our r, and that would be a point

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.700
on our curve for this theta.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.020
Now how do you convert that to x and y's?

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.847
Well you can construct a little bit

00:01:37.847 --> 00:01:40.409
of a right triangle right over here.

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.659
And we know from our basic trigonometry

00:01:44.808 --> 00:01:48.148
that the length of this
base right over here,

00:01:48.148 --> 00:01:50.776
this is going to be the hypotenuse.

00:01:50.776 --> 00:01:54.665
Let me just write that, that's
going to be our x-coordinate.

00:01:54.665 --> 00:01:56.648
Our x-coordinate right over here

00:01:56.648 --> 00:01:59.667
is going to be equal to our hypotenuse

00:01:59.667 --> 00:02:02.750
which is r times the cosine of theta.

00:02:04.788 --> 00:02:08.114
If we wanted the y-coordinate
as a function of r and theta,

00:02:08.114 --> 00:02:10.685
it'd be y is equal to r sine of theta,

00:02:10.685 --> 00:02:11.542
but they don't want us to worry about

00:02:11.542 --> 00:02:13.617
y here, just the x-coordinate.

00:02:13.617 --> 00:02:18.215
So we know this, but we want
it purely in terms of theta.

00:02:18.215 --> 00:02:19.719
So how do we get there?

00:02:19.719 --> 00:02:23.063
Well what we can do is,
take this expression for r,

00:02:23.063 --> 00:02:24.937
r itself is a function of theta,

00:02:24.937 --> 00:02:28.063
and replace it right over there.

00:02:28.063 --> 00:02:30.208
And so what we can do, is we can write,

00:02:30.208 --> 00:02:34.041
well, x of theta is
going to be equal to r,

00:02:34.895 --> 00:02:38.312
which itself is three theta sine of theta

00:02:40.852 --> 00:02:44.602
times cosine of theta,
times cosine of theta.

00:02:46.701 --> 00:02:48.583
And now, we wanna find the rate of change

00:02:48.583 --> 00:02:50.225
of the x-coordinate with respect to theta

00:02:50.225 --> 00:02:52.356
at a point, so let's
just find the derivative

00:02:52.356 --> 00:02:54.508
of x with respect to theta.

00:02:54.508 --> 00:02:57.828
So x prime of theta is equal to,

00:02:57.828 --> 00:03:00.777
well I have the product of
three expressions over here.

00:03:00.777 --> 00:03:03.308
I have this first expression, three theta,

00:03:03.308 --> 00:03:06.228
then I have sine theta, and
then I have cosine theta.

00:03:06.228 --> 00:03:08.842
So we can apply the product
rule to find the derivative.

00:03:08.842 --> 00:03:09.869
If you're using the product rule

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:11.279
with the expression of three things,

00:03:11.279 --> 00:03:12.834
you essentially just
follow the same pattern

00:03:12.834 --> 00:03:14.452
when you're taking the
product of two things.

00:03:14.452 --> 00:03:16.065
The first term is gonna be the derivative

00:03:16.065 --> 00:03:19.134
of the first of the expressions, three,

00:03:19.134 --> 00:03:21.699
times the other two
expressions, so we're gonna have

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:25.199
three times sine of theta cosine of theta,

00:03:27.516 --> 00:03:30.267
plus the second term is going to be

00:03:30.267 --> 00:03:33.127
the derivative of the middle term times

00:03:33.127 --> 00:03:36.710
the other two expressions,
so we're gonna have

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:40.356
three theta and then
derivative of sine theta

00:03:40.356 --> 00:03:43.152
is cosine theta, times
another cosine theta,

00:03:43.152 --> 00:03:46.129
you're gonna have cosine squared of theta,

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:49.416
or cosine of theta
squared, just like that.

00:03:49.416 --> 00:03:52.431
And then you're gonna have the
derivative of the last term,

00:03:52.431 --> 00:03:54.299
is going to be the
derivative of cosine theta

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:56.596
times these other two expressions.

00:03:56.596 --> 00:03:57.911
Well the derivative of cosine theta is

00:03:57.911 --> 00:04:00.567
negative sine theta, so if you multiply

00:04:00.567 --> 00:04:03.995
negative sine theta times
three theta sine theta, you're

00:04:03.995 --> 00:04:08.162
going to have negative three
theta sine squared theta.

00:04:12.267 --> 00:04:15.539
And so, we want to
evaluate this at point P.

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:17.972
So what is theta at point P?

00:04:17.972 --> 00:04:21.222
Well, point P does happen
on our first pass around,

00:04:21.222 --> 00:04:24.305
and so, at point P, theta is equal to

00:04:25.653 --> 00:04:29.570
theta right over here is
equal to pie over two,

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.727
so pie over two, so what
we really just need to find

00:04:34.727 --> 00:04:38.647
is, well what is x prime of pie over two?

00:04:38.647 --> 00:04:42.480
Well, that is going to
be equal to three times

00:04:44.163 --> 00:04:47.080
sine of pie over two, which is one,

00:04:48.317 --> 00:04:51.984
times cosine of pie
over two, which is zero,

00:04:53.302 --> 00:04:57.469
so this whole thing is zero,
plus three times pie over two,

00:04:58.811 --> 00:05:01.561
this is three pie over two, times

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.083
cosine squared of pie over two, or

00:05:05.083 --> 00:05:06.916
cosine of pie over two squared.

00:05:06.916 --> 00:05:10.453
Well that's just zero, so
so far, everything is zero,

00:05:10.453 --> 00:05:13.855
minus three times pie over
two, three pie over two

00:05:13.855 --> 00:05:16.772
times sine of pie over two squared.

00:05:18.948 --> 00:05:20.094
Well what's sine of pie over two?

00:05:20.094 --> 00:05:22.442
Well that's one, you square
it, you still get one.

00:05:22.442 --> 00:05:27.363
So all of this simplified to
negative three pie over two.

00:05:27.363 --> 00:05:29.002
Now it's always good
to get a reality check.

00:05:29.002 --> 00:05:31.176
Does this make sense
that the rate of change

00:05:31.176 --> 00:05:34.956
of x with respect to theta is
negative three pie over two?

00:05:34.956 --> 00:05:35.943
Well think about what's happening.

00:05:35.943 --> 00:05:37.843
As theta increases a little bit,

00:05:37.843 --> 00:05:40.238
x is definitely going to decrease,

00:05:40.238 --> 00:05:44.302
so it makes sense that we
have a negative out here.

00:05:44.302 --> 00:05:46.442
So, right over here, rate of change of x

00:05:46.442 --> 00:05:50.206
with respect to theta,
negative three pie over two.

00:05:50.206 --> 00:05:53.361
As theta increases, our
x for sure is decreasing,

00:05:53.361 --> 00:05:56.097
so at least it does make intuitive sense.
