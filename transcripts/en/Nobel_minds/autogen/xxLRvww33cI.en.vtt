I started before finance was even a real

I started before finance was even a real
discipline so there wasn't anything

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:07.849
discipline so there wasn't anything

like that so everything was new at that
 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.340
like that so everything was new at that
time and it took a while initially

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350
time and it took a while initially
 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.320
time and it took a while initially
before it made its way into practice but

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330
before it made its way into practice but
 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.400
before it made its way into practice but
then it was kind of like a explosion

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410
then it was kind of like a explosion
 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.599
then it was kind of like a explosion
waterfall it took maybe ten or fifteen

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609
waterfall it took maybe ten or fifteen
 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.569
waterfall it took maybe ten or fifteen
years before initially the applied world

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579
years before initially the applied world
 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.299
years before initially the applied world
the investment world came around to the

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309
the investment world came around to the
 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.130
the investment world came around to the
new way of thinking but then when they

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140
new way of thinking but then when they
 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.740
new way of thinking but then when they
did now it's basically instant so

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750
did now it's basically instant so
 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:40.729
did now it's basically instant so
they're they're looking over our

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739
they're they're looking over our
 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.100
they're they're looking over our
shoulders all the time and now to see

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110
shoulders all the time and now to see
 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.389
shoulders all the time and now to see
what's going on and see how they can

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399
what's going on and see how they can
 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.790
what's going on and see how they can
incorporate it into their their product

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800
incorporate it into their their product
 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.819
incorporate it into their their product
so finance is really very applied as a

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829
so finance is really very applied as a
 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.770
so finance is really very applied as a
as a discipline the research gets

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780
as a discipline the research gets
 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.560
as a discipline the research gets
applied very quickly if it works if it

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570
applied very quickly if it works if it
 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.379
applied very quickly if it works if it
has anything to say
