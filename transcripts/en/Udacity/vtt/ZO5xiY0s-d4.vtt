00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:06.580
Here's another equation for you to solve. Log base 10 of 5 x plus log base 10

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:13.180
of x minus 1 equals 2. To start off please condense the left hand side here to

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:17.250
be the logarithm of just a single quantity. So in other words use the

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.120
properties of logs that you learned to combine these two log expressions.
