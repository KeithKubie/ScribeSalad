00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:02.210
- In the first round of today's
competition

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:03.960
you'll have to combine the
steel from that sprocket

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.290
with the steel of that
chain to make a billet,

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:10.040
from which to forge a signature
blade in your signature style.

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.670
Good luck, bladesmiths.

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.500
Your three hour forge
time starts now.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:16.540
Here we go.

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.540
Each of our bladesmiths
has a sprocket

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.380
that is mild steel and a
chain it is hardenable steel.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.830
The chain's pretty obvious,
but the sprocket I think

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:29.830
is going to be confusing
them a little bit.

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.580
It looks like that would be a
nice chunk of hardenable steel,

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.580
but it's mild.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.210
My plan for this
challenge, I'm

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.830
going to take that sprocket,
forge out a billet,

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:42.500
and I'm going to take some
of these damn chain links

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.880
and I'm going to forge
weld them into the spine.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.080
I don't think Liam
realizes that sprocket

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.330
is mild, unhardenable
steel, and he's making

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:50.830
a complete blade out of it.

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.210
Oh, [inaudible].

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.580
You got that
sprocket Incorporated?

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:56.580
It's all sprocket.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.080
I incorporated the chain.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.170
I'm getting this blade
pretty much where I want it.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:01.420
It feels good in the hand.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.290
You can tell where
the links are.

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.080
I want to do a good
thermal cycling,

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.920
and then give it a good quench.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.920
Can you thermal cycle mild
steel to make it harder?

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:10.580
- No.
- No.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:16.040
Liam's in the quench.

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:24.620
Moment of truth.

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.580
And the file doesn't skate.

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:30.920
It doesn't harden.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.080
If the metal's not
hard, it'll fold

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.580
when it hits the ice block.

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.290
Round two.

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.540
How do we get high
carbon steel on the edge

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:39.790
of Liam's blade, Dave?

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:40.790
How?

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.080
You build a time machine.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.880
You travel back three hours.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.170
Liam, with a second quench.

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.330
Is it still biting?

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:51.460
It's still biting
a little bit.

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:52.500
Mine is, too.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.500
What's your edge steel?

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:54.750
The sprocket.

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.500
I just forge-welded
in the links.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.330
Chain is normally mild steel.

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:59.580
No, it's hard.

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.330
I ground every tooth
off my sprocket.

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.170
I'm not too convinced that
it's hardenable steel.

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.790
Well, that's what
this all is, then.

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.170
Good luck.

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:10.960
Now I'm second guessing
my steel selection,

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.920
using the sprocket for my edge.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.080
I run over to the acid tank,
give my blade a quick dip,

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.790
and that's when I notice it.

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.290
[bleep]

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.170
Liam forged an entire
blade that is mild steel.

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.620
[bleep]

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.170
- Is that going to cut?
- No.

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.880
It'd make a good butter knife.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.830
I just wasted three
hours making a really cool

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:35.330
looking knife that isn't
going to hold an edge.

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.120
I could be going home.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.790
But, you know what?

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.330
I've had bigger hurdles and
bigger struggles in my life.

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:44.960
I've battled depression.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.670
I've battled PTSD.

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.540
I've buried more friends to
suicide than I have to combat.

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.880
At this point in time,
I've got what I've got.

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:53.790
I just need to move forward.

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.120
It will have to do.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.460
My biggest concern going
into judging, it's my steel.

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.210
I potentially made a
catastrophic mistake

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:03.540
by using the wrong
metal to make a blade.

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.210
Bladesmiths, the first
round of competition is over.

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:08.710
Now it's time for
the judges to take

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:10.420
a closer look at your work.

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.250
Ethan, you're up first.

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.080
Please present your
blade to the judges.

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.250
Well, Ethan, I
really like to shape.

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.420
I like that you gave
us a lean piece.

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.250
You've got a pretty
good curve in the blade

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.420
there that needs
to be addressed.

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:26.580
Liam, you're next.

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.670
First up, Liam,
I love this design.

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.250
It's almost like a kukri.

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.540
Forward heavy, so that means
you have to really take

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.750
care of that handle, that
when I go forward with this,

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.500
something's got to stop it
from flying out of my hand.

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.830
You file checked this?

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:47.000
File checked it
the first time.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.460
It skated in a couple of spots.

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:51.790
Do you have an idea what
that sprocket material was?

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.460
I'm guessing it was a
chromium alloy of some type.

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:55.620
Thank you.

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:56.750
Evan, you're up.

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.790
Evan, I like the
profile overall.

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:06.290
You've got a swell on the top
and bottom, in the midsection,

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:07.750
and a flare on the back.

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.420
And that's exactly what
I like to see on a knife

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:10.540
that I'm going to
be swinging around.

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.960
But I see chain
all through this.

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:19.460
Where is the sprocket?

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:23.960
My plan with the sprocket
was to weld on bolsters.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.380
I wish I could have
done a San Mai,

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.620
but I was fooling too
much with the chain.

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.580
So just to be clear,
there is only one

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.330
type of metal in this blade?

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:34.330
Yes, sir.

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:35.170
OK.

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:37.330
Thank you.

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.290
Evan, by failing to
combine your two steels

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:42.460
together to form
that signature blade,

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.330
you fail to meet parameters.

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.330
For that reason, I have to
ask you to leave the forge.
