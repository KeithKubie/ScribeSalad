 I'm an idiot, 

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:05.480
 I work for the Google Play app and development team. 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.490
 We have been pursuing an endeavor to create applications for children and the family. 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:12.315
 How many attendees work for children and family software developers? 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:16.370
 Excellent. 

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:22.860
 If the vision is hidden from one of you, just tell me. 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.240
 Well, I always like to start with the offer - maybe 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.000
 Some have already seen this but explained that this 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.670
 It's about creating great apps for kids and family, 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:33.430
 And that's what we're trying to do. 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.020
 To play the video please. 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.478

00:00:38.478 --> 00:00:39.936
 [Music playing] 

00:00:39.936 --> 00:00:42.838
 -1, 2, 3. 

00:00:42.838 --> 00:00:43.338

00:00:43.338 --> 00:00:46.254
 [Child laugh] 

00:00:46.254 --> 00:00:49.656
 - Get - 

00:00:49.656 --> 00:00:53.568
 Now, do we need butter? 

00:00:53.568 --> 00:00:54.301
 -No. 

00:00:54.301 --> 00:00:55.035
 The other way. 

00:00:55.035 --> 00:00:55.836
 this way. 

00:00:55.836 --> 00:00:56.502
 Wonderful. 

00:00:56.502 --> 00:01:00.403
 To do this, bend it like this. 

00:01:00.403 --> 00:01:00.903
 My God! 

00:01:00.903 --> 00:01:02.859
 What we cover. 

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:04.326
 - I want to cut your hair. 

00:01:04.326 --> 00:01:07.630
 Where is the black color? 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.118
 Uh, it's in my eyes. 

00:01:09.118 --> 00:01:10.602
 Does this look like my hair? 

00:01:10.602 --> 00:01:11.102
 -Yeah. 

00:01:11.102 --> 00:01:11.602
 -Yeah. 

00:01:15.562 --> 00:01:16.062
 3. 

00:01:21.514 --> 00:01:22.014
 -Yeah. 

00:01:22.014 --> 00:01:23.502
 correct answer. 

00:01:23.502 --> 00:01:24.990
 -I did it. 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.982
 your turn. 

00:01:25.982 --> 00:01:28.462
 -okay then. 

00:01:28.462 --> 00:01:29.103
 -That's it. 

00:01:29.103 --> 00:01:31.103
 So everything is fine and clean. 

00:01:35.833 --> 00:01:40.034
 "Why do you sit there like this?"

 [End of Play] 

00:01:54.589 --> 00:01:56.880
 Shadidya Sekomi: I watched this video many times, 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.090
 Every time I feel chills. 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.640
 But what we do here is your help to create 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.640
 More of these family moments, 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.370
 Google has invested heavily 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.520
 In the field of children and the family. 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.370
 How many attendees heard about Google Play 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.250
 For families? 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.500
 Which we announced at Google I / O. Okay. 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.250
 Only a limited number of attendees heard of it. 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.030
 Sorry, let me try to move to the next slide. 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.830
 It's basically a new exploration experience on Play. 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.930
 This is done through a separate section for children and family content 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.770
 You can subscribe to this section as well 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:35.270
 To be in the Play Store. 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.079
 This allows parents to 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:38.870
 Go to a specific place to search 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.400
 About content for children, either through browsing 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.180
 Groups for children, by age group, or even by 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.790
 Famous characters. 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.080
 Well, I'll talk a little about some key elements 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.220
 Which we have undertaken in this context. 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.780
 So the search results are also relevant here. 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.960
 For example, if you're looking for music, 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.730
 In the Families section, you see, 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.330
 The results will be very different, 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.130
 Because we realize you're looking 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:05.900
 For content for children and family. 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.030
 You'll only see results from apps 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.090
 Games enabled in the Family Program, 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.540
 While doing the same search elsewhere on Play 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.840
 Very different results appear. 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.970
 And to mention this relevant research, regardless of 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.220
 Your site, if you're researching - and you know, 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.340
 Google is really searching. 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.450
 So if we realize you're looking for children's content, 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.340
 Children's educational games or apps will appear 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.720
 For children of three years of age, or in this case, 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.400
 Coloring for children - thus the results you get will be enhanced, 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.856
 Or apps and games created for kids-- 

00:03:43.856 --> 00:03:46.480
 Because we realized it was a child's search - so the search is enhanced 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.350
 To appear within the top results, 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:51.070
 Regardless of where you are searching. 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:55.440
 Again, the research, which is the main means of parents 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.620
 To search for content for their children 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.969
 In addition to browsing or characters, 

00:03:59.969 --> 00:04:01.510
 We have made a great effort 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:06.840
 To ensure that they have the content you publish and that is appropriate for them. 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.450
 Earlier figures have mentioned, 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.220
 We know the importance of characters in children, 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:11.580
 Each of them has his favorite character. 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.520
 They want to get all the interesting content. 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.010
 I have two children, one at seven and the other at eight 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.970
 They have gone through various stages of obsession with these characters. 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.079
 But what we did was that we wanted a specific place - from 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:25.190
 Parents view, provides all this content 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:26.940
 What is required regarding the character of Pippa pig, 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.045
 Or Dora, Elmo, Snow Queen, or whatever you want. 

00:04:31.045 --> 00:04:32.670
 So you get apps and games as well 

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:35.780
 Movies and TV content and books. 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.140
 Thus, it is a way for parents to find this content. 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:41.000
 Then it's for developers like you 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.260
 Those who invest in licensing, it really is 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.280
 Gives you an opportunity to show licensed content 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.500
 In front of users in other ways 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.910
 Do not just search for it. 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:58.050
 Finally, we've added a lot of tools and controls 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.540
 To facilitate parents find great content and safe 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:02.430
 For their children. 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.050
 For example, we have content evaluation 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:06.870
 Which we launched earlier this year. 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.610
 Everyone in the store - not only children and family, 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:11.750
 But everyone is available for them to evaluate the content. 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:13.570
 You will not reach the family section 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:17.100
 Unless you get an E or E10 rating. 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:21.000
 We also let parents know which apps or games they have 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.940
 Ads or buy in-app if this is important to them. 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.619
 If you are a parent looking for something 

00:05:26.619 --> 00:05:28.160
 In a certain category, or you want 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:29.576
 Knowing its suitability to age, we 

00:05:29.576 --> 00:05:31.480
 We put badges to help you get there. 

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:34.350
 Finally, we also put more 

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:39.990
 Controls using password to limit 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:43.350
 In-app purchases by children inadvertently. 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:45.700
 This was in terms of design and development. 

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:49.220
 We also invest a lot in marketing 

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:49.720
 And promotion. 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:53.210
 Where we really seek to join more users to 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:54.940
 Family section to show them the content you publish. 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:56.750
 Of course, there are many types 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:59.450
 Email marketing campaigns and social networks. 

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:01.790
 We work with the bosses who 

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:05.430
 They have the experience of compiling distinct selections on Play 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:07.020
 Offering a lot of seasonal themes. 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:09.930
 In addition, we have done something new 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:12.540
 Of its kind by establishing an actual event in New York on digital content 

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:15.740
 A few months ago using content posted by some partners 

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:17.310
 Important, as the picture shows 

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:20.200
 Children really enjoyed working with physical and digital content, 

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:23.830
 Similar to what you saw in the video. 

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:26.980
 Thus, we talked about design and development side, 

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:29.530
 But from our point of view, the action 

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:31.050
 With so many people in attendance, 

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:33.170
 It is the same store, 

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:37.290
 Gave us some understanding of how to create a great application, 

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:38.980
 How to market it, and make money from it. 

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:41.750
 I wanted to share this with you, including experiences 

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:43.260
 Some developers. 

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.640
 Some of this seems clear, 

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:47.926
 Thank you. 

00:06:47.926 --> 00:06:50.172
 To understand your audience, 

00:06:50.172 --> 00:06:52.130
 In the area of ​​children, this may be a little difficult 

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:53.744
 Because you have two types of audience. 

00:06:53.744 --> 00:06:55.160
 There is a parent who 

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.390
 Will buy the content. 

00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:59.830
 And you have a child who will be the consumer. 

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:02.420
 And already want to satisfy each other, 

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:05.280
 Parents are looking for educational value, 

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:07.900
 They care about something that motivates 

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:10.650
 The creativity of their children allows them to explore. 

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:13.310
 Children are looking for exciting and boring things 

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:14.140
 Are different from those in educational content. 

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:15.700
 Children want to interact. 

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:19.250
 You need to take this simple difference into consideration. 

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:21.620
 And another thing I say to software developers, 

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:23.820
 Do not try to give everything to everyone 

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:26.570
 Because this is not really possible. 

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:29.144
 We know that middle school students are different from young children, 

00:07:29.144 --> 00:07:30.560
 There is even a difference between children 

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:31.730
 At the age of five and others at the age of eight or 

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:33.930
 Children at the age of eight and others at the age of 11. 

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:36.260
 So at Google, our research - 

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.670
 He must think about the main audience that is seeking him 

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:42.300
 Improve the application to the public 

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:46.030
 In terms of levels of development and language ability, 

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:50.454
 And their motor skills, and actually achieve it. 

00:07:50.454 --> 00:07:51.870
 That is why we have age groups, 

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:53.980
 As you can see, in the family section, 

00:07:53.980 --> 00:08:01.410
 You can enable your app in up to two adjacent age groups. 

00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:03.630
 Also, involve children in your research from the beginning, 

00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:07.085
 So from the moment you think about creating the application, so to speak. 

00:08:07.085 --> 00:08:09.460
 Budge Studios is one of the partners we work with 

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:11.890
 Hundreds of children have been involved from the start 

00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:13.790
 During the test. 

00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:16.857
 The company tests the game and conducts search groups and questionnaires online. 

00:08:16.857 --> 00:08:18.440
 When thinking about applications, 

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:20.780
 Do not forget to pay attention to the goal of it, and that in the end 

00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:23.006
 Will attract public attention. 

00:08:23.006 --> 00:08:24.630
 This is also particularly useful 

00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:28.360
 Because these children have parents who 

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:30.090
 Interact with the content at an early stage 

00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:31.880
 They were with you from the beginning, 

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:36.520
 They will be the strongest supporters and customers 

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:38.870
 They influence the field when they tell other children 

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:40.285
 And parents about the content you publish. 

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:46.590
 Children are particularly interested in the picture, 

00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:50.580
 You really want to capture their imagination, 

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:51.840
 Grab their attention. 

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:56.190
 This is done in part by large and colorful icons 

00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:59.250
 Illustrations, characters, screen shots, and videos 

00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:01.050
 High quality. 

00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:03.840
 In an informal questionnaire we had with children, 

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:09.032
 We asked what the main thing you were looking for 

00:09:09.032 --> 00:09:10.670
 When you choose the application? 

00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:13.003
 I thought there might be a lot of different things 

00:09:13.003 --> 00:09:16.580
 When I thought of myself as an adult, the answer was one 

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:18.520
 It is the symbol. 

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:20.530
 Children choose the application based on code. 

00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:24.060
 How many people are surprised? 

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:25.110
 Maybe I was the only one. 

00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:26.220
 Because I was thinking, in the purpose of the application 

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:27.640
 And how important it is 

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:30.750
 I thought of it as a mother of children. 

00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:32.790
 But in any case, you should not neglect to think about 

00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:34.723
 What suits children. 

00:09:34.723 --> 00:09:37.300
 It is also necessary to think about the vocabulary of children in particular, 

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:40.370
 And the size of their fingers, so small words are chosen 

00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:42.660
 Large lines, and lots of colors. 

00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:45.190
 Smart Study says one of our partners in Japan 

00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:48.100
 They do not use any text, 

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:50.790
 They rely only on images in their lists, 

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:54.360
 It also has buttons large enough 

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:57.382
 Keep children who can not read or their motor skills 

00:09:57.382 --> 00:09:58.965
 Very low are able to participate and interact. 

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:04.537
 So you need to turn education into fun, otherwise it will not work. 

00:10:04.537 --> 00:10:06.120
 Also remember that the parent is in need of 

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:08.120
 To be convinced that this thing 

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:09.820
 The purchase is worth the child's benefit. 

00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:13.950
 So it needs to be in an educational way and in an attractive way. 

00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:16.900
 Also the company [? IntelligeOA?] Is one of the most application developers 

00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:21.650
 A success on the Play platform for children's content, 

00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:23.442
 This company thinks without complacency in what 

00:10:23.442 --> 00:10:26.940
 If the content will add an educational value 

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:28.260
 or not? 

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.120
 Even if the three-dimensional effect is truly impressive, 

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:33.927
 But it will detract from the value of learning you get, 

00:10:33.927 --> 00:10:35.010
 They do not add it. 

00:10:37.449 --> 00:10:38.990
 In addition to this, you need 

00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:40.710
 Also make the application simple. 

00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:43.230
 Things like simplicity and clarity are of great importance. 

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:46.010
 So when Avokiddo started designing Thinkrolls 1 and 2 

00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:50.000
 They told us that they excluded all the complex scenarios, 

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.890
 Complex user interface, multi-screen levels, 

00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:55.030
 They only kept the application simple. 

00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:58.430
 Until children interact with the application, this should happen naturally. 

00:10:58.430 --> 00:11:00.720
 Children and parents can not be affected 

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:03.219
 On the directory try to find out 

00:11:03.219 --> 00:11:04.260
 How does this thing work? 

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.509
 They will leave the app before they understand it. 

00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:11.540
 Then stress again, as you may have heard at a previous session 

00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:13.400
 Today, place your focus on quality. 

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:14.790
 Quality is really important, 

00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:16.810
 It's important because people pay for it. 

00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:20.150
 You can see the jump in revenue by adding 

00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:21.370
 One Star. 

00:11:21.370 --> 00:11:23.870
 But in the area of ​​children, it is very different. 

00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:26.250
 Because when you buy for someone else, 

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:28.910
 Like a parent who buys a child, 

00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:31.170
 You want a signal telling you, you know, 

00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:33.940
 That this will impress your child. 

00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:37.430
 So they use ratings as one of these signals 

00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:38.670
 For admiration and leave a high rating. 

00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:41.499
 I think there is a great possibility that my child will love him. 

00:11:41.499 --> 00:11:43.040
 It must therefore be reaffirmed 

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:46.270
 That the application users in the initial trial version 

00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:48.450
 Who loved the application 

00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:51.545
 Or the game will go to the store and leave an assessment. 

00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:58.400
 So we talked about how to design a great application. 

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:00.400
 We will now talk about how to make profits from it? 

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:02.690
 I think you are familiar with monetization 

00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:05.580
 In the field of children and family has its difficulty, 

00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:07.430
 These are some of the models we have seen in 

00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:11.580
 Children's apps, subscriptions and ads 

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:13.846
 In-app purchases and surcharges. 

00:12:13.846 --> 00:12:14.720
 I'll talk about her, 

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:16.400
 Each has its advantages and disadvantages. 

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:19.780
 I think you should find what fits 

00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:21.660
 The content you provide is the best. 

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:23.740
 For extra charges, great for extra charges 

00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:26.780
 Every time someone gets something, you will receive money. 

00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:28.390
 When downloading, you pay for it, 

00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:29.910
 Which generates profits in your bank account. 

00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:32.710
 But this works really well if you are a well-known brand, 

00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:35.280
 If you spend money to establish yourself as a brand. 

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:37.220
 In fact, Toca Boca and Sago Sago are walking 

00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:38.640
 Well in this frame. 

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:41.210
 Because when you subtract the new, 

00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:43.730
 The user is aware of the quality of the quality he will receive. 

00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:49.982
 The experience of the thing before you buy it will benefit anything in life, 

00:12:49.982 --> 00:12:51.440
 So we have policies to return, 

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:56.010
 Where you can check the app before getting involved forever. 

00:12:56.010 --> 00:12:57.920
 Why should apps and games be different? 

00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:01.610
 But in the family, this is very important 

00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:04.190
 Because, by going back to the question I posed earlier, 

00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:07.110
 When someone buys something for someone else, 

00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:08.340
 Risk increases. 

00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:10.490
 So you need to provide the signals they want, 

00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:16.750
 I was reading a paper 

00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:21.170
 Show that parents are willing to pay $ 99 in something 

00:13:21.170 --> 00:13:23.820
 They know that their child will love, use and relate to it 

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:26.570
 For a long time, but they will not 

00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:28.520
 Spending $ 0.99 on something 

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:30.210
 It will get them bored in 10 minutes. 

00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:33.120
 But how do they know that their child will enjoy it? 

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:35.470
 So this model works really well 

00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:39.190
 When the parent feels that 

00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:40.470
 This content will appeal to my child. 

00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:42.950
 We come to the annoying part of this, well, 

00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:47.867
 I receive notifications constantly 

00:13:47.867 --> 00:13:49.700
 To spend more and spend more and spend more on this, 

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:52.370
 Then I need to buy this to move to the next level. 

00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:54.080
 StoryToys has dealt wonderfully to solve 

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:57.330
 This is where content is made free of charge 

00:13:57.330 --> 00:13:59.960
 At first, but then help you buy one inside the application 

00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:01.500
 Get the rest of the application. 

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:04.220
 This gives the company the advantage of the child's experience of the application 

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:06.720
 The parent knows that his child will enjoy 

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:10.040
 Content but without notice 

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:13.010
 Parent time after time with many parts of the content 

00:14:13.010 --> 00:14:15.390
 Needed to be purchased. 

00:14:15.390 --> 00:14:20.620
 Subscriptions are also very popular in children. 

00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:22.340
 Well, I really want to do a quick survey 

00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:24.880
 Among the developers of children's programs present, to learn 

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:28.000
 How many applications have additional charges? 

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:28.500
 Okay. 

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:32.390
 How many of you has an in-app purchase? 

00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:34.920
 How many of you have subscriptions? 

00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:35.670
 How many of you have ads? 

00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:40.900
 So subscriptions are becoming more popular. 

00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:42.590
 Of course, the good news is this 

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:46.600
 Is the low cost of acquisition of the user, which is great, 

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:48.900
 Then the flow of profits frequently to the developer, 

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:53.360
 Where he can continue to invest in the product. 

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:55.080
 But part of the challenge here remains 

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:57.790
 You need to renew or add something new, 

00:14:57.790 --> 00:15:01.200
 Or find a way to make parents ready to continue 

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:03.200
 Pay on a frequent basis because they are 

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:05.260
 They get something. 

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:06.870
 By the way if you use subscriptions, 

00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:09.190
 For your information, you do not need to 

00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:10.930
 Processing of financial transactions, 

00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:12.480
 Google makes the payment exactly as it is 

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:16.690
 Pay with paid or in-app purchases. 

00:15:16.690 --> 00:15:18.870
 Although this is not necessarily a business model 

00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:21.360
 In itself, but I want to address the licensing of intellectual property. 

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:25.255
 How many attendees have intellectual property that others have licensed? 

00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:29.760
 That's part of the reason behind 

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:31.600
 Provide pages for characters, for this investment. 

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:33.350
 While it is really wonderful 

00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:37.062
 That you get the target audience, 

00:15:37.062 --> 00:15:39.270
 A type of audience that already exists for the brand. 

00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:42.170
 This gives you an already existing brand marketing 

00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:43.730
 Which helps you to challenge 

00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:45.720
 The discovery of user acquisition. 

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:49.070
 However, you also have a certain standard or quality level 

00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:50.680
 The application needs to be adhered to, 

00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:52.840
 Where brand lovers expect it, 

00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:56.140
 Or the trademark owner will exercise some degree of control over what 

00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:56.720
 Produced. 

00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:58.800
 It is also clear that the economic side 

00:15:58.800 --> 00:15:59.920
 It will be different, 

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:01.336
 It is a point to think about 

00:16:01.336 --> 00:16:04.470
 If you enter the licensing area. 

00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:06.865
 Well, we talked about application design, 

00:16:06.865 --> 00:16:08.365
 We now turn to income from it, 

00:16:08.365 --> 00:16:09.910
 How do I attract users to the app? 

00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:13.395
 How does the user understand the need for the application? 

00:16:13.395 --> 00:16:14.770
 Well, one of the most important things to achieve this 

00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:17.170
 Is to create a compelling store data list to view, 

00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:18.635
 They are of particular importance in the area of ​​children, 

00:16:18.635 --> 00:16:21.010
 I was talking about symbols and their actual significance to them. 

00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:24.210
 So make sure they are attractive, 

00:16:24.210 --> 00:16:27.290
 If someone is looking for a developer like you, be careful 

00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:28.900
 To find you actually. 

00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:33.000
 So headlines must be very clear up 

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.240
 Appear and stand out in search results. 

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:38.430
 In the list of your store data, first describe clearly 

00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:39.240
 Role played. 

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:41.280
 Then add all the prizes you have earned. 

00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:43.910
 But should be clear in talking about what it offers 

00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:45.330
 The application does not offer. 

00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:48.160
 After getting people's attention, 

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:50.590
 Put attractive screenshots and videos, 

00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:52.950
 Because this is what drives them to switch to 

00:16:52.950 --> 00:16:56.060
 Page to download 

00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:59.170
 Content and install it. 

00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:02.140
 How many attendees have tried the A / B test with data lists 

00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:04.020
 the shop? 

00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:04.579
 Okay. 

00:17:04.579 --> 00:17:07.520
 It's something we launched at Google I / O, 

00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:10.577
 I think, this includes everyone, 

00:17:10.577 --> 00:17:12.910
 You may have heard this in the previous presentation, as well 

00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:15.800
 People have seen great success using this. 

00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:17.839
 And for those who do not know it, it allows you 

00:17:17.839 --> 00:17:20.839
 Try any part of your listing, 

00:17:20.839 --> 00:17:22.940
 Through A / B tests, you know who works better. 

00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:24.634
 If it is a different symbol or a different title 

00:17:24.634 --> 00:17:27.020
 Or different graphics, etc. 

00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:30.220
 BabyFirst uses this test strongly, 

00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:32.550
 And found when changing the code 

00:17:32.550 --> 00:17:34.280
 It has achieved a 10% increase in the number of installations. 

00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:37.570
 So I changed him immediately. 

00:17:37.570 --> 00:17:40.990
 So I would recommend you use this test with something 

00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:44.936
 In the importance of the symbol in the field of children. 

00:17:44.936 --> 00:17:46.560
 Then there are the developer pages that you have 

00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:49.200
 We launched it at the I / O conference, which is a way for you guys 

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:51.800
 To establish a brand for yourself on Play. 

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:55.521
 How many attendees have developer pages? 

00:17:55.521 --> 00:17:57.270
 For those who do not have, 

00:17:57.270 --> 00:17:58.750
 I certainly advise them to look at this, 

00:17:58.750 --> 00:18:01.380
 Where you can place a banner ad and an icon representing 

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:03.140
 Your brand and unique apps. 

00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:06.190
 It is also important when conducting marketing campaigns, 

00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:09.220
 Especially if it is not specific to a specific application, 

00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:11.340
 You can then direct people to your developer page 

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:14.336
 Rather than having to select the content pane 

00:18:14.336 --> 00:18:15.460
 Which you want to direct them to. 

00:18:18.370 --> 00:18:20.700
 And then we all hear about things that take effort, 

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:22.660
 Among them also get the best applications 

00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:24.220
 Games for children. 

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:27.964
 So, take care to mobilize the audience and attract users 

00:18:27.964 --> 00:18:29.380
 Who know their love for the content you publish 

00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:31.190
 Ask them to leave comments on it. 

00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:35.412
 Especially in the field of children and the family, because for us 

00:18:35.412 --> 00:18:36.870
 We parents have gotten used to 

00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:39.550
 To hear from other parents to see what they like 

00:18:39.550 --> 00:18:42.890
 Then we turn to watch the content, and perhaps the children heard from each other about the game. 

00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:45.840
 So this is a place for parents 

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:47.340
 Read what other parents do 

00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:49.881
 Use this as a way to find something similar to it 

00:18:49.881 --> 00:18:51.340
 For their child. 

00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:54.890
 Also, take care to respond to comments if users leave comments 

00:18:54.890 --> 00:18:57.250
 Or expressed an admiration for something, or left their opinion, 

00:18:57.250 --> 00:18:59.610
 Do not forget to answer them and keep in touch with them 

00:18:59.610 --> 00:19:00.560
 To create your community. 

00:19:04.670 --> 00:19:07.170
 Now how many of you have a channel on YouTube 

00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:09.380
 For the applications and games it offers? 

00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:09.940
 well good. 

00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:14.170
 This is actually more than I have seen during my speech on this in the United States. 

00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:17.320
 I know there are kids on YouTube. 

00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:20.880
 I think there is an increase of 200% in the family channels 

00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:21.840
 On YouTube alone. 

00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:24.490
 Children communicate with other creators, 

00:19:24.490 --> 00:19:27.160
 They add content from users' creation, 

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:29.710
 They watch other children playing. 

00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:30.840
 So you must be there. 

00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:34.370
 You need a page to view movies 

00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:37.450
 The promotion of the games you offer, the style of play, 

00:19:37.450 --> 00:19:40.470
 Or you can provide user-generated content, 

00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:42.390
 Provide tips, or identify users 

00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:44.970
 New products. 

00:19:44.970 --> 00:19:48.430
 Now we have another thing which is the cards - well, I say now, 

00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:49.639
 I mean actually a few months ago, 

00:19:49.639 --> 00:19:51.179
 Where this feature has emerged shortly. 

00:19:51.179 --> 00:19:52.820
 But now it has become an evolving form of captions, 

00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:54.570
 You can be inside the video itself 

00:19:54.570 --> 00:19:57.540
 Place a card to guide people anywhere, 

00:19:57.540 --> 00:19:58.611
 Including to your app. 

00:19:58.611 --> 00:20:00.360
 Even if they're watching a video about the app 

00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:02.592
 And they wanted to get it, you just one click literally, 

00:20:02.592 --> 00:20:04.300
 Give them the opportunity to move there and get the app. 

00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:09.830
 Finally, you need to be in where your audience is, 

00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:11.980
 So he was interested in promoting the appropriate channels for the family. 

00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:14.700
 Including parents' codes and groups of mothers, 

00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:18.790
 And other forums where there are influential people 

00:20:18.790 --> 00:20:19.710
 The cemeteries are already important. 

00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:22.780
 They will help you to get the audience 

00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:26.250
 And know who you need to reach. 

00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:28.460
 So do your best to know 

00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:31.080
 Influencers in your particular area 

00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:33.030
 Or influencing for the content you publish in particular 

00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:36.870
 Encourage them to tell the public about your app. 

00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:40.500
 We actually do this in Play in the Family section 

00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:44.410
 Through expert groups drawn from experts such as Levar Burton 

00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:47.770
 And other entities, where they talk about applications 

00:20:47.770 --> 00:20:52.030
 And games they love and help recommend content 

00:20:52.030 --> 00:20:52.725
 I have other users. 

00:20:55.610 --> 00:20:59.530
 How many attendees participate in the "Design for Families" 

00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:01.245
 On Play? 

00:21:01.245 --> 00:21:02.870
 Compared to the number of children's software developers, 

00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:04.870
 This is actually very few. 

00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:08.920
 If you do not participate, and you are in the field of children and family, 

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:10.920
 I encourage you to get more information 

00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:13.690
 At developer.android.com/families 

00:21:13.690 --> 00:21:14.640
 Within the program. 

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:18.040
 But then, if you go to the developer console 

00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:20.450
 - All applications - 

00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:22.600
 They moved to the pricing and distribution department, 

00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:24.220
 And select the box "I want 

00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:26.000
 Join Play for Families. " 

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.527
 This in turn leads to placing your affiliate content in 

00:21:28.527 --> 00:21:30.610
 Play for Families, and you'll get all the features 

00:21:30.610 --> 00:21:34.910
 Which I talked about in the past about the research and so on, 

00:21:34.910 --> 00:21:37.940
 And you're also everywhere in the usual Play Store, 

00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:39.580
 Thus double benefit is achieved. 

00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:42.464
 Where you will not be excluded from a place to be in the other. 

00:21:42.464 --> 00:21:43.255
 I do not believe this, 

00:21:43.255 --> 00:21:44.338
 I have already finished early. 

00:21:44.338 --> 00:21:45.620
 I never do this. 

00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:48.670
