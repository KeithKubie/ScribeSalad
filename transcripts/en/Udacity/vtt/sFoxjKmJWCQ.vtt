00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The first answer--all HTML is XML--that's not true.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Despite the similarity between the two, HTML can have things in it that are not valid in XML.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
A good example was the void tag--the tag--with no closer.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
All XML is HTML.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
This is also not true, but it is borderline acceptable.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
You could certainly--if you had an XML document that was full of all HTML tags

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
it would be very close to HTML and would actually probably render in a browser just fine.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
For example, if you included in your browser something like this--

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and opening and closing tag--it would actually probably render just fine.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Actually, that's a good question. I'd invite you to see if this enters one new line or two.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
I honestly don't know off the top of my head, and I'm not going to quiz you on it.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Now, the next answer--HTML can be expressed in XML. That is true.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
When we use the doc type XHTML instead of just HTML,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
that says the following HTML document is actually going to be a valid XML document,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and you can parse it as such.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
You don't have to look for broken tags.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Your browser doesn't do less work.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
It's not expecting the HTML to be somewhat sloppy as HTML often is.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
If you say it's in XML, it'd better be in XML though,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
because the browser is not going to be quite as lenient on you.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
The final answer--XML and HTML share a common lineage--this is also true.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Remember their ancester is SGML, which stands for Standard Generalize Markup Language.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:36.000
There are actually many other types of documents that descended from SGML,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and HTML and XML are the two that will affect our lives in this course.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Okay, let me just show you some doc types in the browser

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
now that we have a little bit more of a framework to understand these.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
If I were to go to Wikipedia, and I were to view the source of Wikipedia,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
I would see that the doc type is HTML.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
This means HTML5. I know it doesn't say 5, but trust me on this one.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Doc type HTML means HTML5, which is the most modern version of HTML we have.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Now, if I were to go to a particular Wikipedia page, the Wikipedia page for SGML, for example,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
and I were to look at the source of this page,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
we see that the doc type is actually XHTML.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
It's actually XHTML transitional, which basically means the document is going to be in XML

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
but will have some non-standard things in there.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
I'm not going to get into too much of how this affects things,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
but it does make some browsers behave differently.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Why Wikipedia has two different doc types on two different pages I cannot explain to you.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Although I can offer one guess, which is the SGML page is probably generated dynamically,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
and the front page is probably a nearly static page that are served from two different servers

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
or two different machines, which is fine. You see things like this all over the internet.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
But when you see XHTML that means every tag in here should have a closing tag.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
You can see, for example, some of these header tags are these little void tags

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
that have the closing slashes.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
You wouldn't see that in most HTML5 documents,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.678
although any browser would accept it, because it doesn't actually hurt anything.
