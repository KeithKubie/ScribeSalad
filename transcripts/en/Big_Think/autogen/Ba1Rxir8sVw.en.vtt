we tend to think of our experience that

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:12.490
we tend to think of our experience that
 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:13.500
we tend to think of our experience that
just sort of happening to us

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:13.510
just sort of happening to us
 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:16.740
just sort of happening to us
instantaneously so you know I don't

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:16.750
instantaneously so you know I don't
 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.050
instantaneously so you know I don't
think when I talk to someone that they

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:19.060
think when I talk to someone that they
 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.810
think when I talk to someone that they
are across the room and therefore

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:21.820
are across the room and therefore
 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.339
are across the room and therefore
there's a certain amount of time that it

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:23.349
there's a certain amount of time that it
 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:25.820
there's a certain amount of time that it
takes for me to hear what they're saying

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830
takes for me to hear what they're saying
 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.290
takes for me to hear what they're saying
we just think that everything happens in

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:28.300
we just think that everything happens in
 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.740
we just think that everything happens in
real time but you know the fact is that

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:31.750
real time but you know the fact is that
 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.460
real time but you know the fact is that
we perceive the world through this organ

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:35.470
we perceive the world through this organ
 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.450
we perceive the world through this organ
in the brain and it works a lot kind of

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:39.460
in the brain and it works a lot kind of
 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.650
in the brain and it works a lot kind of
like a like a telegraph so if you were

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:43.660
like a like a telegraph so if you were
 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.420
like a like a telegraph so if you were
to send a message to somebody with a

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:45.430
to send a message to somebody with a
 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.029
to send a message to somebody with a
telegraph and you start tapping out your

00:00:48.029 --> 00:00:48.039
telegraph and you start tapping out your
 

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:50.100
telegraph and you start tapping out your
your message they're not going to get

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:50.110
your message they're not going to get
 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.049
your message they're not going to get
the message immediately it's going to

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:52.059
the message immediately it's going to
 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:54.360
the message immediately it's going to
take time for all those dots and dashes

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.370
take time for all those dots and dashes
 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.880
take time for all those dots and dashes
to make their way down the wire and get

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890
to make their way down the wire and get
 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.020
to make their way down the wire and get
to the other end we have wiring in our

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030
to the other end we have wiring in our
 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.689
to the other end we have wiring in our
own brains we have neurons which work a

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:03.699
own brains we have neurons which work a
 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:05.670
own brains we have neurons which work a
lot like telegraph wires in some ways

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680
lot like telegraph wires in some ways
 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.669
lot like telegraph wires in some ways
say they actually use kind of a

00:01:08.669 --> 00:01:08.679
say they actually use kind of a
 

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:11.730
say they actually use kind of a
biological set of dots and dashes their

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740
biological set of dots and dashes their
 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.880
biological set of dots and dashes their
little spikes of voltage that we use to

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890
little spikes of voltage that we use to
 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.380
little spikes of voltage that we use to
process information so you know if I see

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390
process information so you know if I see
 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.410
process information so you know if I see
something it takes a while for it to get

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420
something it takes a while for it to get
 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.960
something it takes a while for it to get
from my eye into my brain and then it

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.970
from my eye into my brain and then it
 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.340
from my eye into my brain and then it
takes a while for it to spread to

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350
takes a while for it to spread to
 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:27.630
takes a while for it to spread to
different parts of the brain and then

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640
different parts of the brain and then
 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.280
different parts of the brain and then
for that information to get integrated

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.290
for that information to get integrated
 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.960
for that information to get integrated
in lots of different ways the way that

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970
in lots of different ways the way that
 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.999
in lots of different ways the way that
you can think about this really vividly

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:36.009
you can think about this really vividly
 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:38.760
you can think about this really vividly
was was brought home to me once when I

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770
was was brought home to me once when I
 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.280
was was brought home to me once when I
was talking to a neuroscientist named

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290
was talking to a neuroscientist named
 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.249
was talking to a neuroscientist named
Michael Gazzaniga and he just basically

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:44.259
Michael Gazzaniga and he just basically
 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:46.230
Michael Gazzaniga and he just basically
all he did was he took his finger and he

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240
all he did was he took his finger and he
 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.510
all he did was he took his finger and he
stuck it on his nose and he said you

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520
stuck it on his nose and he said you
 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.630
stuck it on his nose and he said you
know it's interesting is that you feel

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640
know it's interesting is that you feel
 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.160
know it's interesting is that you feel
your finger touching your nose and you

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170
your finger touching your nose and you
 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:54.569
your finger touching your nose and you
feel your nose touching your finger at

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:54.579
feel your nose touching your finger at
 

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:58.440
feel your nose touching your finger at
the same time but the fact is that the

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450
the same time but the fact is that the
 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.660
the same time but the fact is that the
signal from your fingertip had a lot

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670
signal from your fingertip had a lot
 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.240
signal from your fingertip had a lot
longer to go than the signal from your

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250
longer to go than the signal from your
 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.510
longer to go than the signal from your
nose and yet they got to your brain and

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520
nose and yet they got to your brain and
 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:07.740
nose and yet they got to your brain and
they felt like it was happening at the

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750
they felt like it was happening at the
 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.810
they felt like it was happening at the
same time so so so your thoughts have

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:12.820
same time so so so your thoughts have
 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.270
same time so so so your thoughts have
this speed and your brain has to to your

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280
this speed and your brain has to to your
 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.090
this speed and your brain has to to your
brain how to to deal with that that

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100
brain how to to deal with that that
 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.770
brain how to to deal with that that
speed has to deal with that delay

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780
speed has to deal with that delay
 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.340
speed has to deal with that delay
now you might think well you know we

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350
now you might think well you know we
 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.860
now you might think well you know we
should just have brains that that work

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870
should just have brains that that work
 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.780
should just have brains that that work
as fast as possible so we should just

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790
as fast as possible so we should just
 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.310
as fast as possible so we should just
have you know fast fast neurons and just

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320
have you know fast fast neurons and just
 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.230
have you know fast fast neurons and just
to speed everything up you know because

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.240
to speed everything up you know because
 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.090
to speed everything up you know because
because time is money because because

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100
because time is money because because
 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.650
because time is money because because
you know your survival might depend on a

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660
you know your survival might depend on a
 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.830
you know your survival might depend on a
fast signal there's a problem though is

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840
fast signal there's a problem though is
 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.190
fast signal there's a problem though is
that speeding up these signals

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200
that speeding up these signals
 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.880
that speeding up these signals
doesn't come for free so one strategy

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890
doesn't come for free so one strategy
 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.630
doesn't come for free so one strategy
that that we have evolved for fast

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640
that that we have evolved for fast
 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.199
that that we have evolved for fast
thought as it were is to insulate our

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209
thought as it were is to insulate our
 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:01.270
thought as it were is to insulate our
neurons and this is actually you know

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280
neurons and this is actually you know
 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.040
neurons and this is actually you know
something that is used a lot in

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050
something that is used a lot in
 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:04.570
something that is used a lot in
engineering I mean if you don't want to

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580
engineering I mean if you don't want to
 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.430

signal to dissipate out of out of a wire

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440
signal to dissipate out of out of a wire
 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.030
signal to dissipate out of out of a wire
you you want to insulate it we insulate

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040
you you want to insulate it we insulate
 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.210
you you want to insulate it we insulate
our neurons with sort of fatty molecules

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220
our neurons with sort of fatty molecules
 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.930
our neurons with sort of fatty molecules
like myelin another thing you can do is

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940
like myelin another thing you can do is
 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.760
like myelin another thing you can do is
that you can actually take another trick

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:18.770
that you can actually take another trick
 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:21.550
that you can actually take another trick
that telegraph engineers first developed

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560
that telegraph engineers first developed

which is to make your neurons thick so

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140
which is to make your neurons thick so
 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.229
which is to make your neurons thick so
signals will go through a fast wire I'm

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239
signals will go through a fast wire I'm
 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:28.479

sorry signals will go through a fat wire

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489
sorry signals will go through a fat wire
 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:32.350

quickly faster than a thinner wire now

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360
quickly faster than a thinner wire now
 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.890
quickly faster than a thinner wire now
the problem is that insulating your

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900
the problem is that insulating your
 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.110
the problem is that insulating your
neurons and making them fat is a big

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120
neurons and making them fat is a big
 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.810
neurons and making them fat is a big
cost it takes a lot of energy to do that

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:40.820
cost it takes a lot of energy to do that
 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.370
cost it takes a lot of energy to do that
energy you could be using for other

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:42.380
energy you could be using for other
 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.860
energy you could be using for other
things and not only that but you know

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870
things and not only that but you know
 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.750

our signals work quickly in some neurons
 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:07.360
our signals work quickly in some neurons
and slower and others we've found this

know when I put my nose touch my finger

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130
know when I put my nose touch my finger
 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.680
know when I put my nose touch my finger
to my nose I actually don't want the

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690
to my nose I actually don't want the
 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.020
to my nose I actually don't want the
signal from my nose to go too fast I

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030
signal from my nose to go too fast I
 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:30.370
signal from my nose to go too fast I
actually want the timing to make

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380
actually want the timing to make
 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:31.930
actually want the timing to make
everything seem to be happening at once

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940
everything seem to be happening at once
 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.119
everything seem to be happening at once
so actually some time

00:04:34.119 --> 00:04:34.129
so actually some time
 

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:35.889
so actually some time
you need to slow thought down a little

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:35.899
you need to slow thought down a little
 

00:04:35.899 --> 00:04:37.689
you need to slow thought down a little
bit in order for the world to make any

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:37.699
bit in order for the world to make any
 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:39.999
bit in order for the world to make any
sense
