1
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:06,530
Let me remind you that everything I did
so far in class came from analyzing the

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:14,120
loadings transformations and you guys
should be really on top of those two

3
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:18,960
marvelous equations because all the stuff
we are doing as a consequence of that,

4
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:23,310
I won't go over how we derive them
because I've done it more than once,

5
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,760
but I remind you that if you've got an
event that occurs at XD for one person

6
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:36,440
and to a person moving to the right
at the last city you the same event,

7
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:42,890
we'll have coordinates x prime is x minus
ut over the square root and deep prime

8
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:53,690
is t minus UX overseas
were divided by the square.

9
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:57,450
This is it. This is the key from this.

10
00:00:58,050 --> 00:00:59,970
By taking differences of two events,

11
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:04,680
they can get similar equations for
coordinate differences. In other words,

12
00:01:04,681 --> 00:01:09,681
they have two events are separated in
space by Delta x for one person and a

13
00:01:10,891 --> 00:01:12,600
delta x prime for another person

14
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:19,440
and likewise in time. Then you get
similar formula for differences.

15
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:24,360
So differences are related the same
way that coordinators themselves are,

16
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:30,570
or I will write it any way because I will
use it sometimes one way and sometimes

17
00:01:31,621 --> 00:01:32,454
the other way.

18
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,370
Even this one you can think of as a
formula for a difference except one of the

19
00:01:38,371 --> 00:01:42,180
coordinators of the origin. This is
in general if you've got two events,

20
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,840
not necessarily at the origin than the
spatial separation and time separation or

21
00:01:48,331 --> 00:01:52,740
connected in this fashion.
So I put this to work,

22
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:56,790
I got a lot of consequences from
that. You remember that? For example,

23
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,840
I said take a clock that
you're carrying with you

24
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:05,040
are,

25
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,020
let's take a clock that I'm carrying with
me and let's see how it looks to you.

26
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:13,470
And let's say it goes stick and
it goes stick one more time.

27
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:15,810
So for me,

28
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:20,730
the time difference between the two
texts will be let's say one second.

29
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,050
It's a one second clock.

30
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:26,460
The space differences zero because the
clock is not going anywhere for me.

31
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:31,830
So for you, Delta t prime is one
second divided by the square root,

32
00:02:31,831 --> 00:02:35,370
which is more than one second. So you
will say, hey, in the time your clock,

33
00:02:35,371 --> 00:02:38,490
take one second,
I really claimed two seconds have passed.

34
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:43,940
Therefore you will say my clocks are
running slow and it's easy to see from the

35
00:02:44,251 --> 00:02:48,450
same equations that if you replace the
prime than unprimed ones simply change

36
00:02:48,451 --> 00:02:49,380
your domain minus you.

37
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,770
Nothing changes the clock that you think
you said breast with respect to you,

38
00:02:52,771 --> 00:02:54,120
we look slow to me.

39
00:02:55,890 --> 00:03:00,890
Then I showed you how want when you want
to measure the length of a stick with

40
00:03:01,061 --> 00:03:02,320
this traveling past you,

41
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:07,870
you get your assistance on the who are
lined up on the x axis to measure the two

42
00:03:07,871 --> 00:03:12,430
ends of the rod at any particular
time they like and take the spatial

43
00:03:12,431 --> 00:03:16,030
difference. That's the meaning
of the length of a moving rock.

44
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,920
You've got to measure both
then at the same time.

45
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:23,500
So you make sure the two measurements are
done at the same time. So Delta t zero,

46
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:26,920
the distance between them is what
I call the length of the Rod.

47
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:32,110
You are moving with the rod and as
long as you're moving with the Rod, uh,

48
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,040
there are,

49
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,900
has got two points with the separated
by the length l not and one thing occurs

50
00:03:37,901 --> 00:03:39,790
at one and other things
across to the other end.

51
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:44,770
The spatial difference between them
will be simply the length of the rock in

52
00:03:44,771 --> 00:03:45,880
your frame of reference.

53
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:51,430
So Elle will be l Knox Times if you
bring the squared or to the other side,

54
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:56,820
l will be l not times the square root
where the Delta t prime would be some

55
00:03:57,521 --> 00:04:00,640
Delta Tau,
the rest frame divided by the square root.

56
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:09,090
Okay. Not that important. Results I
showed you was a lack of simultaneity.

57
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,220
It's not absolute.

58
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:17,590
So I started with unfortunate example
of twins born in Los Angeles in New York

59
00:04:19,161 --> 00:04:24,161
and you guys were pointing out that no
normal woman could do that except the one

60
00:04:26,481 --> 00:04:31,160
from your Mama jokes and your mama jokes.
You're mom is so big,

61
00:04:31,161 --> 00:04:32,300
she can have a kid in New York

62
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:39,620
so I don't want to deal with,
so that's cosmological optics right now.

63
00:04:39,621 --> 00:04:44,030
So I will say pick a better example.
Two things happen.

64
00:04:44,031 --> 00:04:46,730
Something here,
something there separated by distance.

65
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:50,060
People cannot agree that
they were simultaneous.

66
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:55,700
Now you got to say very surprising.
People cannot agree on length.

67
00:04:55,701 --> 00:05:00,370
The difference between two events.
For example, New York and Los Angeles,

68
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:03,860
3000 miles apart. We think you can move
in a train, you can move in a plan.

69
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:08,960
You all have to agree on the separation
but you don't that just a consequence of

70
00:05:08,961 --> 00:05:10,940
now the new relativity.

71
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:14,510
In the old days before I did relativity,

72
00:05:14,511 --> 00:05:19,511
I was taking just the good old x and y
coordinates and I said you can take a

73
00:05:19,881 --> 00:05:23,300
point, you can assign to it
some coordinates x and y.

74
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:29,020
Then somebody comes along with the rotated
axes and no one seems to be troubled

75
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:35,320
by the fact that the same point is no
given a new set of coordinates by this new

76
00:05:35,391 --> 00:05:36,224
person

77
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:41,260
are take a pair of points on this line,

78
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,280
but that person in the rotator system,

79
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:49,390
these events have the same white prime
coordinate because you see this is the

80
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:52,870
white prime equals zero access,
the accurate at the same white prime,

81
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:56,800
but for me they're not the same white
coordinate because that has that way

82
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:58,750
coordinate.
That's a different way quarterly,

83
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:04,730
so we fully used to the fact that having
the same x coordinate what we events is

84
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:07,490
not an absolute statement.
Depends on the frame of reference.

85
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,430
Having the same white
coordinators also not absolute,

86
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:16,490
but somehow in the case of time we
used to think that time differences are

87
00:06:16,491 --> 00:06:19,850
absolute and spatial differences are
absolute and what we're learning is no,

88
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:22,250
they are just like the x and the y.

89
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:29,750
Okay, so I'm going to do one more thing
with the Lord in his transformation.

90
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:34,190
Just pretty interesting. Let's take
this equation for time difference.

91
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:39,520
Delta t prime is Delta t
minus you delta x or c square.

92
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:46,490
You might invite this.
So let's take two events.

93
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:47,871
First,

94
00:06:47,871 --> 00:06:52,871
nothing happens then something else
happens and Delta t is the separation in

95
00:06:53,781 --> 00:06:54,650
time between them.

96
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:59,240
Do you do minus d one let's say
t two minus Steven is positive.

97
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:04,330
So the p two the second event occurred
after the first event according to me.

98
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:07,280
How bout according to you?

99
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:13,210
Well Delta p prime doesn't have to have
the same sign as Delta t because you can

100
00:07:13,311 --> 00:07:14,300
subtract this number.

101
00:07:14,301 --> 00:07:17,450
You deltek's overseas square and
Delta x can be whatever you like

102
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,233
that for.

103
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:25,070
You can find that Delta
t prime could be negative

104
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:27,463
for you.

105
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:31,730
You've got to understand
that's a big deal.

106
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:35,300
Cause I say this happened first and
that happened later and you say no,

107
00:07:35,301 --> 00:07:36,410
it happened the opposite way.

108
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:41,690
Now this can lead to serious
logical contradictions,

109
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:47,710
especially if even one is
the cost of even to this,

110
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:52,160
the standard example both in special
and general relativity that people talk

111
00:07:52,161 --> 00:07:52,994
about.

112
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:58,140
So even one is somebody's grandmother
is born and even to that person is born.

113
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:04,010
We say birth of the kid.

114
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,130
Take place long after the birth
of grandmother according to me.

115
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:10,010
What if in some other point of view,

116
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,820
the kid does bond by the
grandmother is not yet born?

117
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,080
Yeah,

118
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,770
and somebody goes in assassinates
grandmother, this is in fact,

119
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:21,480
this is called killing the grandmother.

120
00:08:21,481 --> 00:08:23,670
This words are taken
right out of textbooks.

121
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:27,900
Why this kind of violence is inflicted
on grandmothers? I don't know,

122
00:08:27,901 --> 00:08:32,640
but it's a standard example. All logical
contradictions involving time travel,

123
00:08:32,641 --> 00:08:35,490
half the comm have to do with
coming back and doing something.

124
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:38,520
So here's an example.
It's a grandchild is born,

125
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:44,250
grandmothers not yet born and something
has done to prevent it from being born.

126
00:08:44,251 --> 00:08:47,580
Or two second after she's born,
she's hit by the Mafia.

127
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:51,750
How do you explain the grandchild
wet or the grandchild come from?

128
00:08:51,751 --> 00:08:56,430
Because the cause has been eliminated.
Our event,

129
00:08:56,431 --> 00:09:01,431
one I fired a bullet even to somebody is
hit and you go to frame of reference in

130
00:09:02,191 --> 00:09:04,530
which the person has been hit
and I haven't fired the bullet.

131
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:09,870
So you come and you finish me off.
So nobody got this person dying.

132
00:09:09,871 --> 00:09:13,470
But no apparent reason because
the cost has been eliminated,

133
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:15,420
that simply cannot happen.

134
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,590
I instead recognize that that is a limit
to how far he can push this community.

135
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:23,880
And he conceded that if
it can be the cost of B,

136
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:28,350
you better not find an observer for
whom they are couldn't reverse order.

137
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:33,470
Because see if the car's
occurs after the effect,

138
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,560
then that is some time left for
somebody to prevent the cost itself from

139
00:09:37,561 --> 00:09:41,430
happening. And we have an effect
with no perceivable costs.

140
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:47,360
So we wanted to make sure the delta t
prime cannot be reversed whenever the

141
00:09:47,761 --> 00:09:49,770
first event could be the
cause of the second event.

142
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:53,520
So if you go and ask this
integration you've dealt,

143
00:09:53,521 --> 00:09:56,940
that is positive when we'll
delta t prime be negative,

144
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,960
that looks is simple Algebra.
You won this drum to beat that.

145
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,490
So that'll happen if you delta x,

146
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,380
let me put a c here.

147
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:11,370
Another see here is greater than Delta T.
Okay.

148
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,970
If that happens, things are
gonna happen backwards, right?

149
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:23,130
So let's modify that a little
bit by putting this c over here.

150
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:26,340
Yeah.

151
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,960
And rewrite it.
Finally,

152
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:33,410
as you oversee is bigger
than C Delta t over Delta x.

153
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:39,560
That's understand what
does he creation means?

154
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:45,550
This equation means is that if there were
two events separated in time by Delta

155
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:47,270
t and in space by Delta x,

156
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:53,770
I can find an observer at a certain
speed you so that you divided by c if it

157
00:10:53,901 --> 00:10:56,630
exceeds this number four,
that observer,

158
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,970
the time order of events will be reversed.

159
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:03,143
Yup.

160
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:12,090
Hi. It's not yet clear.
Velocity is greater than C.

161
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:16,140
I depends on what's happening in the
top and bottom, so we have to ask

162
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:22,140
what does C Delta t remember don't.
That is a time between two events. See,

163
00:11:22,141 --> 00:11:27,141
Delta t is what is the distance the
light poles can travel in that time.

164
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:33,410
The denominator is a spatial separation
between those two events, so he went,

165
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,430
one is here and even to is there.

166
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:39,810
See Delta t is how far the light signals
can travel in the time separating these

167
00:11:39,811 --> 00:11:42,930
two events.
You've see Delta t looks like that.

168
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:48,120
Then there's enough time for a light
signal to go from here to here.

169
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:54,160
In that case.
See Delta t will be bigger than delta x,

170
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:57,250
but then the velocity that you want,

171
00:11:57,251 --> 00:12:00,960
if your frame will be bigger than one
and that's not possible in the units of

172
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:02,363
wheat of light,

173
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:09,890
the only time you will get a sensible
value for the second frame Emily with you

174
00:12:09,891 --> 00:12:14,891
oversee less than one would be if
see Delta t is less than delta x.

175
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,570
That means here's the first day
when he hits the second event,

176
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:21,680
I light signal [inaudible] gone from there
today in the time between the events,

177
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:28,930
so it is saying that if two events are
such that that was not enough time for

178
00:12:29,271 --> 00:12:34,160
the light signal to leave the first
event and arrive in time for the second

179
00:12:34,161 --> 00:12:34,994
event,

180
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:38,990
then we can actually find an observer
with the sensible velocity for whom the

181
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:43,340
order of events is reversed.
Therefore,

182
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:45,890
what did we learn from this?

183
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:49,700
We learned from this
that you should not be.

184
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:53,870
There is enough time for the light
signal to go from one event to the other

185
00:12:53,871 --> 00:12:57,320
events. Then we will not play
around with the order of events,

186
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:58,580
but if there is no time,

187
00:12:58,581 --> 00:13:02,690
even for light signal to go system in
fact allows you to see them in reverse

188
00:13:02,691 --> 00:13:03,524
order.

189
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:07,340
But we have seen that even Twitter
constantly connected that order cannot be

190
00:13:07,341 --> 00:13:09,920
reversed or should not be reversed.

191
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:12,800
So what this is saying is

192
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:19,130
it should be impossible for an
event here to affect a second event,

193
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:24,850
but using a signal faster than light.
Other words,

194
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:28,120
we are going to say that if that wasn't
enough time for a light signal to go

195
00:13:28,121 --> 00:13:29,530
from this event,
that event,

196
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:34,150
then this event could not have been the
cause of that event. We will demand that

197
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:40,590
at for what the theory for it to be,
make logical senses,

198
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:44,490
no signal to travel faster than the
speed of light because if you've got a

199
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:46,860
signal that can travel faster
than the speed of light,

200
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:49,260
then the first event could
have been the concept,

201
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:52,260
the second event because you send the
signal and the signal may blow something

202
00:13:52,261 --> 00:13:55,860
up. But that is not enough time for
light to get there in the same time.

203
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,110
But if you allowed such things,

204
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,660
then you will find a frame of
reference with the velocity.

205
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:04,290
Perfectly sensible in which they occur
backwards and constant effect would have

206
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:05,124
been reversed.

207
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:10,860
So the answer to the whole thing in case
you're still struggling with this issue

208
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:11,753
is the following.

209
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:17,970
What the theory of relativity demands is
that it should be impossible for events

210
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:22,140
influence other events with signals
traveling faster than light.

211
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:24,690
Once you accept that,

212
00:14:24,691 --> 00:14:28,920
that is no logical contradiction in the
theory because the only time I even said

213
00:14:28,921 --> 00:14:32,250
it, worst is in when there was no time
for light signal to go from here to the

214
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:35,430
there. That means there was no way
this could have been the cost of that.

215
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:40,380
For example, when I fired a
bullet, uh, the cost is that
my fighting of the bullet,

216
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:43,950
the effect is whatever it happens to
the recipient and the whole thing takes

217
00:14:43,951 --> 00:14:48,030
place at the speak with the speed
of the bullet. In that case,

218
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:52,520
a c Delta t is definitely bigger than
delta x because in the time it took the

219
00:14:52,521 --> 00:14:55,030
bullet to go from here to there,
the light bulbs could've.

220
00:14:55,031 --> 00:14:58,040
I've also gone there and beyond.
In that case,

221
00:14:58,041 --> 00:15:01,430
you'll never find an observer at a speed
less than that of light for whom they

222
00:15:01,431 --> 00:15:02,570
events will appear backwards.

223
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:07,680
So the special theory of relativity,
uh,

224
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:12,500
isn't another way to ensure
that everything is consistent
is to demand that no

225
00:15:12,501 --> 00:15:15,110
signal travels faster
than the speed of light.

226
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:20,870
No energy,
no signal can travel that fast.

227
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,170
But this leads to
something very interesting

228
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:27,750
that would be of spacetime is no modified.

229
00:15:27,751 --> 00:15:32,751
You see in the old days you had a space
and hear this time and let's say zero.

230
00:15:34,711 --> 00:15:39,510
Zero is where I am right now.
I am at the origin.

231
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,220
My clock says it,
I'm here right now.

232
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:47,240
Any dot I pick here is in my future
because tea is positive for the advantage.

233
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:50,880
They have not happened yet.

234
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:56,820
Any dot I draw here is an event in my
past because it occurred at an earlier

235
00:15:56,821 --> 00:16:00,570
time.
So the Newtonian view of the world,

236
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:02,820
that is something called right now,

237
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:07,320
this horizontal line and everything
I've always called later or future.

238
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,010
Everything below it is called pass.

239
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:15,180
But in special relativity after you're
taking dot Cohn relativistic thing,

240
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:18,030
let's draw it here and access c Times d

241
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:25,520
so whenever you have another
event so that CT is bigger than x,

242
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:31,510
that is enough time for the light
signal to go from here to here.

243
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,480
That's the meaning of seeing
CTE is bigger the next.

244
00:16:34,481 --> 00:16:39,280
This is the lion CT equal sex
misaligned CD bigger than x.

245
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:45,810
This is the event is in the future of
this event according to me and also

246
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:50,220
according to anybody else.
In other words,

247
00:16:50,221 --> 00:16:52,620
Delta t is positive for me,
but if you go back to those,

248
00:16:52,621 --> 00:16:55,290
the questions since seatbelt
that is bigger than x,

249
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:59,460
you'll never find anybody who said this
event occurred earlier than this event.

250
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:01,650
Yeah.

251
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:03,780
Another way to understand
it is if I want a cost,

252
00:17:03,781 --> 00:17:06,330
that event support that as
some explosion going off there,

253
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,270
I send a signal that goes
and makes them happen.

254
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:14,190
That signal has to travel
slower than light to get it.

255
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:18,900
That for it could have caused the event
and therefore there's no screwing around

256
00:17:18,901 --> 00:17:19,980
with the audit of that event.

257
00:17:19,981 --> 00:17:23,610
That is in my future according to
me and according to all observers.

258
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:26,210
Yeah.

259
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:27,530
If you take an event here,

260
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:34,270
so this is called this whole events north
of this 45 degree line is called the

261
00:17:36,081 --> 00:17:38,750
absolute future.
By absolute,

262
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:42,650
I mean future of me,
not only according to me,

263
00:17:42,651 --> 00:17:45,950
but according to all observers,
every observer,

264
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:50,880
this will occur later than this.
It be later by the same number of seconds,

265
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:52,620
but it will be later.

266
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:56,370
So the Delta t between this event
and the seven is positive for me.

267
00:17:56,371 --> 00:18:00,180
It'll be positive for our people. They
will all agree this occurred after this.

268
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:05,130
Therefore, the effect appeared
before the cost. I'm sorry,

269
00:18:05,131 --> 00:18:06,720
the costs appeared before the effect,

270
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:12,590
and it is not really necessary that this
event be caused by this event is only

271
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,180
necessary that it could have been caused
by this event because not every event

272
00:18:18,181 --> 00:18:22,500
in the university is caused by some other
event. It can just simply happen. Uh,

273
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,960
we have heard that stuff happens.

274
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:30,350
Stuff happens here with no obvious costs
as long as this in the future according

275
00:18:30,571 --> 00:18:33,630
to me, by this definition it's in
the future according to all people.

276
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,170
So this is called the future
because you can affect it.

277
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:40,081
For example,

278
00:18:40,081 --> 00:18:44,100
if I heard something terrible's going to
happen at this point I can send my guys

279
00:18:44,101 --> 00:18:45,420
to go over there and do something.

280
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:48,780
They have to travel at the speed that it
is less than the speed of light so they

281
00:18:48,781 --> 00:18:53,190
can affect,
these events are called the absolute past.

282
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:58,320
What that means is any event here could
have been the cost of what's happening

283
00:18:58,321 --> 00:19:03,321
to me right now because from that event
a signal can be sent to arrive where I

284
00:19:03,901 --> 00:19:06,150
am right now at a speed less
than the speed of light.

285
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:08,780
Yeah.

286
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:09,613
This line,

287
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:14,950
which is called the light cone is a
borderline case where you can communicate

288
00:19:14,961 --> 00:19:19,070
from here to here using the light signal.
So that's also considered as future.

289
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:21,830
But what about an event here?

290
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:30,290
Suppose this distance is two
seconds times the velocity of light.

291
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:37,860
That does not happen yet.
I suppose.

292
00:19:37,861 --> 00:19:41,720
I go there and opened my envelope and
it says something terrible is going to

293
00:19:41,721 --> 00:19:45,780
happen at this point.
That is nothing I can do.

294
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:51,390
There's nothing I can do in the Newtonian
days. There is something you can do.

295
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:55,810
Tell someone else to really hurry up and
get there and do something well not be,

296
00:19:55,811 --> 00:19:57,180
you cannot do that because for that,

297
00:19:57,181 --> 00:20:01,500
someone to leave you with the instruction
to do something about this requires

298
00:20:01,501 --> 00:20:04,260
that person to travel faster than
light and that's not allowed.

299
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:10,330
So even though you know things can
happen here in the future and you have

300
00:20:10,621 --> 00:20:13,080
knowledge of the fact that someone's
planning to do something there,

301
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:14,063
you cannot get there.

302
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:20,960
Okay? That's a really important thing. Uh,

303
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:25,270
even for people who are
going to law school and all
of you guys are not going to

304
00:20:25,271 --> 00:20:30,010
physics, but suppose you're going to law
school, you got the DNA defense, right?

305
00:20:30,011 --> 00:20:33,250
My clients DNA doesn't match.
He has another defense.

306
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:38,700
If your client was accused of doing
something here and was last seen here,

307
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:43,960
you can argue that my client
was outside the light cone

308
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,450
that's called outside
the light cone defense.

309
00:20:47,451 --> 00:20:49,690
And it's absolutely water
tight better than anything.

310
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,560
Cause if that event is outside
the late corner of your client,

311
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:57,130
the client cannot be held responsible
because your client will have to send a

312
00:20:57,131 --> 00:20:59,860
signal passionate,
enlightened that lies on broken.

313
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:05,550
So what about the status
of an event like this?

314
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:12,020
The status of this event is I can actually
find other observers moving at speed

315
00:21:12,391 --> 00:21:16,560
less than light for whom this
event occurs before this event.

316
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:18,500
Yeah,

317
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,220
it's the order of events can be reversed,

318
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:24,120
but it will not lead to
logical contradictions
because we know the two events

319
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:28,830
are not constantly connected.
So space and time,

320
00:21:28,831 --> 00:21:32,430
it used to be divided into upper half
plane and lower half plane into the future

321
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:37,230
and past and a tiniest sliver call
present now divided into three regions.

322
00:21:37,231 --> 00:21:41,780
The absolute future that you can
affect the absolute past worth,

323
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:45,690
whose whose events can affect you.
And this is not, doesn't have a name.

324
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,600
Okay.

325
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,900
If you want, you can call it the
little it, the future according to you,

326
00:21:49,901 --> 00:21:52,210
but I'll find somebody to whom
that occurs before this one.

327
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:54,923
Yeah.

328
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:58,440
Okay. That's also a consequence
of the Lord in Samsung Nation.

329
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:00,160
So you can see that the equation,

330
00:22:00,161 --> 00:22:05,161
so very deceptively simple in fact that
a lot easier looking than some equations

331
00:22:05,421 --> 00:22:09,060
with angular momentum. Right? But the
consequences are really stupendous.

332
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:12,900
They all follow from that equation.
And of course,

333
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,310
if you invent a theory like this,

334
00:22:14,311 --> 00:22:16,470
you got to make sure that
are no contradictions, right?

335
00:22:16,471 --> 00:22:17,960
Suppose you find the theory.
Yeah,

336
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:20,820
very happy with everything the last
day of lights coming out. Right?

337
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:24,570
And somebody points out to you that
the order of events can be reversed.

338
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:27,090
Then you got agree,
you'll be in a panic.

339
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:31,200
Because how can I reverse the order of
events then? The theory is so beautiful.

340
00:22:31,201 --> 00:22:35,940
Internally it says you can reverse the
order of events if they could not have

341
00:22:35,941 --> 00:22:40,941
been causally connected where the causally
connected means a signal traveling at

342
00:22:41,101 --> 00:22:44,640
a speed less than light, good dot have
gone from the first of the second event.

343
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:46,620
Okay.

344
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:50,790
And the theory, uh, does not allow them
to be, if a signal could have gone,

345
00:22:50,791 --> 00:22:54,240
it allows them to be never reversed.
If signal could not have gone.

346
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:57,900
It does say you can find people for
whom even psycho in the reverse order.

347
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,570
All right,
so this is the uh,

348
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:05,310
second thing and it's called the
light corn for the following reason,

349
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:07,560
I only shown you an x coordinate,

350
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:09,930
but if you have white coordinate
coming onto the blackboard,

351
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:13,690
the surface of look like a corn,
that's why we call it the late corn.

352
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:16,440
So sitting at a point in
four dimensional space time,

353
00:23:16,441 --> 00:23:20,820
there's a cone and all points in that
forward light cone or even you can effect

354
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:24,630
all points in the backward light corner
events that can come and get you right

355
00:23:24,631 --> 00:23:29,631
now and the rest of the thing outside
the two cones a you cannot do anything

356
00:23:29,671 --> 00:23:30,504
about,

357
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,750
even though you know something's going
to happen and they cannot do anything to

358
00:23:33,751 --> 00:23:34,584
you,

359
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:39,330
you open an envelope and it says somebody
he had is planning to do something to

360
00:23:39,331 --> 00:23:40,110
you.

361
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:45,000
You don't have to worry
because that person cannot
get you in the time available.

362
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:49,820
The fastest signal is the light signal
and that won't get there and neither will

363
00:23:49,821 --> 00:23:52,760
anything else.
All right.

364
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:58,400
Now we are going to do something which
is theoretically or mathematically very

365
00:23:58,401 --> 00:24:03,401
pretty so for those of you who
like a mathematical elegance,

366
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:08,960
this is certainly the best example I can
offer you because it is simple and also

367
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:12,380
rather profound but it's
completely by analogy.

368
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,050
The analogy is the following.

369
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:20,740
We have seen that when we rotate our
axes as have shown there that the x prime

370
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:28,630
is not the same as x related
by this formula and wipe crime.

371
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:34,370
It's also not the same as why
but related by this formula.

372
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:37,913
Yeah,

373
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:41,440
nothing is sacred coordinates
of a point or not sacred.

374
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:46,580
They are just dependent on who is looking
at them from what orientation but even

375
00:24:46,601 --> 00:24:51,601
in this world we noticed that x Prime
Square plus y prime square is the same as

376
00:24:54,101 --> 00:24:56,200
x squared plus y squared.

377
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:02,590
They only the length of the
point connecting the origin
to you or the distance

378
00:25:02,591 --> 00:25:04,630
from the artisans and
effected by rotations.

379
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:10,250
This is called an invariant. This
doesn't depend on who is looking at it.

380
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,310
Everyone will agree on this,

381
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,650
but they won't agree on x and
they want to agree on white.

382
00:25:14,651 --> 00:25:19,600
But they will agree on this.
So it's reasonable to ask.

383
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:23,770
In the relativistic case where
people cannot agree on time,

384
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:28,840
coordinate artspace coordinate maybe
the square of the time and the square of

385
00:25:28,841 --> 00:25:33,550
the space will be the same for two people.
One can ask that question.

386
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:37,540
So we'll we look at that.
We'll find out that that's not the case.

387
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:43,030
The squared plus x squared is not in
variant, but even before you do that,

388
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,710
you should shut at the prospect of
writing something like this, right?

389
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:52,180
What's wrong with this?
Good.

390
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:56,410
Everyone's on top of the unit scam.
So we cannot add t squared x squared.

391
00:25:56,500 --> 00:26:00,310
There is no way this can be anything.
So we don't have, we have to fix that.

392
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:04,720
We got to have either both coordinates
in spacetime measured with lengths or

393
00:26:04,721 --> 00:26:07,540
with time.
The standard trick is to do the following.

394
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:13,660
Let's introduce uh,
an object with two components.

395
00:26:13,661 --> 00:26:15,250
I'm going to call it capital x.

396
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,850
The first component of that
is going to be called x.

397
00:26:18,851 --> 00:26:20,530
One is going to be called EC zero.

398
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:25,980
Second is going to be called x one x zero
I mean x one is just our family or x.

399
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:34,080
X zero is going to be essentially
a time but multiplied by C.

400
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:35,840
Okay.

401
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:40,580
Why do I switch from t and x two zero
and one it is just that if you want to go

402
00:26:40,581 --> 00:26:42,470
back to more coordinates,

403
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:47,890
if you wanted to bring back y and z then
I just managed them for future use that

404
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:53,210
in four dimensions you really have
zero x one x two and x three that is a

405
00:26:55,981 --> 00:27:00,981
shorthand for zero and what you and I
used to call the position are of the

406
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:06,570
project
you've just said in one dimension,

407
00:27:06,571 --> 00:27:11,040
the vector art becomes a number x and I
want to call the number as x one because

408
00:27:11,041 --> 00:27:15,740
it's the first of the three coordinates
and if you're doing super strings,

409
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:18,320
you're going to have 10
coordinates and one will be x,

410
00:27:18,321 --> 00:27:20,220
not in the nine will be spatial quarters.

411
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:25,360
So we like the new medical index rather
than letters in the alphabet because you

412
00:27:25,851 --> 00:27:29,180
run out of letters but you don't
run out of these subscripts.

413
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:32,960
So I'm writing it purposely in many ways
because if you ever go read something

414
00:27:32,961 --> 00:27:36,350
or you're involved in a lab project or
the group is studying something you want

415
00:27:36,351 --> 00:27:36,561
to read,

416
00:27:36,561 --> 00:27:40,340
the paper people would refer to the
coordinates in spacetime in many ways.

417
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:45,500
Some, we'll call it a, some people
like to write the x the following way.

418
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:50,830
X One x two x three x
four and x for is Ct.

419
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:54,170
That's what you call that,
the fourth dimension.

420
00:27:54,171 --> 00:27:55,490
But it's still the fourth dimension.

421
00:27:55,850 --> 00:27:58,700
But you can either put it at the end
of the first family at three or at the

422
00:27:58,701 --> 00:28:03,230
beginning. So it's very common
for people to use either notation.

423
00:28:03,231 --> 00:28:07,430
I'm just going to call it zero.
So zero is just time, okay?

424
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:12,080
Multiplied by C so that it has units of
length and multiplying by c doesn't do

425
00:28:12,081 --> 00:28:15,500
anything. Everybody agrees on what?
See. So we will all multiply our time.

426
00:28:15,501 --> 00:28:18,410
Coordinate Spicy.
All right,

427
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,870
so let's ask the following question.

428
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:25,430
What does the Lord and his transformation
look like when a writer in terms of

429
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:26,863
these numbers?

430
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:34,320
So first take x prime is x minus ut
divided by the famous square root,

431
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:41,120
but tea is not what I want.
Cts,

432
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:43,790
what I want.
So I fudge it as follows.

433
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:48,820
I rated the x minus you oversee time CT
divided by one minus use square overseas

434
00:28:52,711 --> 00:28:53,544
square.

435
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:55,990
Okay,

436
00:28:55,990 --> 00:29:00,760
this I'm going to write as x is now
called [inaudible] and I'm going to

437
00:29:00,761 --> 00:29:02,560
introduce a new symbol Beta here.

438
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:07,330
This guy is called zero divided
by one minus Beta square,

439
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:12,710
but Beta is universal convention for you
oversee if all velocities that measured

440
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:17,710
as a fraction of the velocity of light
than Beta is a number between zero and

441
00:29:17,711 --> 00:29:18,544
one.

442
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:25,330
So the final way I want to write the Lord
and his transformation for coordinate

443
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:30,730
is that x one prime is x
one minus Beta times x zero.

444
00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:32,590
You might advice squad room,

445
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:37,790
so you have to get used to this beta.

446
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:41,740
I mean you're falling nicely what
I was saying in terms of you,

447
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:46,570
but you have to get used to this beta.
We won't use it a whole lot,

448
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,300
but I put it here so you can recognize it.

449
00:29:49,301 --> 00:29:52,450
When people refer to it in the literature.
If you go read something,

450
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:55,840
what's the transformation law for time?

451
00:29:56,310 --> 00:30:01,310
Remember t prime was t
minus UX oversee square

452
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:09,280
divided by route one minus Beta Square
Betas squared is clearly what sitting

453
00:30:10,251 --> 00:30:13,070
downstairs you oversee is Beta.

454
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:15,590
So what do you think we should do?

455
00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:21,230
We should multiply both sides by sea
because if you multiply both sides by see

456
00:30:21,231 --> 00:30:24,800
policy their policy there
and get rid of this one,

457
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:30,310
then you find x not crime is x not minus
Beta times x one over square root of

458
00:30:32,691 --> 00:30:36,470
one minus Beta Square.
So let me write that here.

459
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:39,680
Don't you see the relationship with
the coordinates is nice and symmetric.

460
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:46,963
Yeah,

461
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:50,170
if you're right in
terms of excellent ante,

462
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:53,890
the coordinate transformation lies not
quite symmetric and that's because one

463
00:30:53,891 --> 00:30:55,840
has units of length in one as UNICEF time.

464
00:30:56,170 --> 00:30:59,110
But if you rescale your
time to try and do a lane,

465
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:04,590
then the transformational laws are very
simple than symmetric between the two

466
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:10,120
coordinates in space that are
also the other coordinates.

467
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:11,500
The y direction.

468
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:16,540
Extra prime is x two and the z
direction x to be primus. Next three.

469
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:17,081
In other words,

470
00:31:17,081 --> 00:31:22,081
the lengths perpendicular to the motion
or something you can always agree on one

471
00:31:22,631 --> 00:31:24,610
can talk and talk about why that is true.

472
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:30,300
Basically what we're saying is if you're
zooming along and you drew a line that

473
00:31:30,761 --> 00:31:35,710
says y equal to one and odors and Leb
agreed on it, we will have to agree on it.

474
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:39,610
Even when I start moving relative to
you because you've got your own line and

475
00:31:39,611 --> 00:31:43,900
there's no in your should about my life
should be about your line or below your

476
00:31:43,901 --> 00:31:46,240
life.
The lanes originally agreed.

477
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:49,860
There is no reason why a Milan,

478
00:31:49,861 --> 00:31:54,850
Ben Saba viewers at your lines below mine
because by symmetry there is no reason

479
00:31:54,851 --> 00:31:58,870
why one should be higher than the other
and the reason this requires that the

480
00:31:58,871 --> 00:32:02,860
two lines, which last forever can
be compared to anywhere you like.

481
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:06,910
I like rods which are running away from
each other and cannot be compared the

482
00:32:06,911 --> 00:32:07,744
lion here,

483
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:12,280
which is why equals the three has got
to be white validity for both of us.

484
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:15,190
So the transfers coordinates
but not modified.

485
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:21,890
Okay. So that's why I don't talk about
them too much. All the interesting action,

486
00:32:21,891 --> 00:32:26,080
this between any one quart in it along
with motion is taking place and time.

487
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:31,090
So now let's ask ourselves maybe uh,
x,

488
00:32:31,091 --> 00:32:35,920
not prime square minus plus x one prime
square is the same as this squared plus

489
00:32:35,921 --> 00:32:39,530
that way. Well, let me
just tell you that, uh,

490
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:43,550
I'm not going to try something that
I know will not work. In other words,

491
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:49,310
you might think x not prime squared
plus x one prime squared is equal to x

492
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:52,760
squared plus x one squared.
Well that just doesn't work.

493
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:54,500
Yeah,

494
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:59,500
that doesn't work because one over
the square root is not a cost data.

495
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:01,850
And Beta with the square
root is not assigned data.

496
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:05,270
You cannot make them cost and sign of
something. If you could, that would work,

497
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:08,840
but it doesn't work.
But I'll tell you what does work.

498
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:11,720
Let's take x,

499
00:33:11,721 --> 00:33:16,721
not prime square minus x one prime
square the square of the time.

500
00:33:18,411 --> 00:33:22,070
Coordinate minus squared of the space.
Coordin with the minus.

501
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:26,100
So let's try to do this in our head.

502
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:30,980
Was waiting this and subtracting it
from the square of this one downstairs.

503
00:33:30,981 --> 00:33:34,280
I think we all agree you
get one minus Beta square

504
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,750
because the square root, the
square. How about upstairs?

505
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:44,760
First you got to square this
guy, this guy, we'll give you x,

506
00:33:44,761 --> 00:33:45,594
not square.

507
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:51,900
Let's bait and squared x
squared minus two Beta x,

508
00:33:51,901 --> 00:33:52,740
not x one

509
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,210
from that actual subtract the
square of x one Prime Square.

510
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:02,560
That'll give me minus x one
square minus Beta squared.

511
00:34:02,561 --> 00:34:06,780
X not squared plus twice Beta x,
not x one.

512
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:15,590
It's just simple Algebra and these cross
Jerome's canceled and you notice I got

513
00:34:17,311 --> 00:34:22,311
an x squared times one minus Beta squared
minus x one squared times one minus

514
00:34:22,741 --> 00:34:23,580
Beta square,
right?

515
00:34:23,581 --> 00:34:27,930
This Algebra I trust you guys can do at
home and the result is this going to be

516
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:30,210
x,
not squared minus x one square.

517
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:36,270
That's very nice.

518
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:41,780
It says that even though people cannot
agree on the time or space coordinator of

519
00:34:41,881 --> 00:34:45,850
an event, just like saying people
cannot agree on what is x and waters,

520
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:49,670
why they can agree on
this quadratic function,

521
00:34:49,671 --> 00:34:51,030
you form more to the coordinates,

522
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:54,780
but it's very different from ordinary
rotations where you take the sum of the

523
00:34:54,781 --> 00:34:55,980
squares here,

524
00:34:55,981 --> 00:34:59,370
you got to take the difference of the
squares and that just the way it is.

525
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:04,650
Even though time is like another
coordinator that mixes with space,

526
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:07,140
it's not quite the same.
In other words,

527
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:10,710
if I brought back the all
the transfers coordinates,

528
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:16,310
then you will find x not frame square
minus x one prime squared minus x two

529
00:35:17,821 --> 00:35:20,690
prime square minus x three prime squared,

530
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:26,390
x squared minus x squared minus
x squared minus six three square.

531
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:30,360
This you can do because x one prime
individually is equal to x one,

532
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:32,010
so you can put them on both sides.

533
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:38,420
This is the actual four
dimensional results for people
who really want to leave

534
00:35:38,821 --> 00:35:41,970
the x axis and move freely in space,
which you're allowed to.

535
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:45,510
This is the invariant. This is the
object that everyone agrees on.

536
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:50,370
Uh, I me once again, but
dropped this most of the time.

537
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:53,100
I'm not going to worry
about transfers coordinator.

538
00:35:55,730 --> 00:35:56,563
So

539
00:35:57,550 --> 00:36:01,060
this is the analog of the leg square for
vector and it's called the space time

540
00:36:01,061 --> 00:36:01,880
in trouble.

541
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:02,713
Okay.

542
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:06,820
It's not the space in trouble.
It's not the time in trouble.

543
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:10,510
It's a space time interval between
the origin and the point x. T.

544
00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:14,363
Yeah,

545
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:18,480
and this is denoted by the symbol
national universal formula,

546
00:36:18,481 --> 00:36:22,380
but let's use square
space time separation.

547
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:30,250
Notice that even though it's called square
square, need not be always positive.

548
00:36:30,251 --> 00:36:33,370
Definite
you can take to events,

549
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:38,080
but with the time coordinate is the
same at the time. Coordinate the zero.

550
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,930
The space coordinator is not zero,
then s squared will be negative.

551
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:46,600
Whereas the usual Pythagoras Lang square
x squared plus y squared is positive.

552
00:36:46,601 --> 00:36:48,190
Definite,
always positive.

553
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:51,280
The space time interval can be
positive or negative or zero.

554
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:58,560
It's positive. If x not can beat the
sum of the squares of those guys,

555
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,480
there's negative.
If they can beat x,

556
00:37:00,481 --> 00:37:04,180
not Anders equal to zero if x
squared equals [inaudible] squared.

557
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:07,993
Okay,

558
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:11,180
so
if you want,

559
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:13,610
if you go back to this
diagram I drew here,

560
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:19,400
this is x one plus x not equal the Ct.

561
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:20,713
Okay.

562
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:25,160
These are events for
with Esquire is positive,

563
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:28,040
these and events but
with squared is positive.

564
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:30,470
Be said even for with Esquire is negative.

565
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:32,810
These are events in with a squared is zero

566
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:40,540
Savannah but s squared is positive.
We have a name for that.

567
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:45,050
It's called a time like separation.

568
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:50,440
This is called time like separation
because the time part of the separation

569
00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:53,320
squared is able to beat the
space part of the separation.

570
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:55,870
He's got more time component
then space component.

571
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:03,290
No, you can also do the following.
Let me introduce some rotation.

572
00:38:03,291 --> 00:38:07,340
Now let us agree that
we will use capital x.

573
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,310
What is space time

574
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:15,520
which watch calling for vectors
afforded vectors. Scott,

575
00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:20,890
four components and the components are
x not and since I'm tired of writing x

576
00:38:21,201 --> 00:38:22,940
one x two x three I will call it art

577
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,100
two in the specialty of relativity,

578
00:38:28,101 --> 00:38:33,101
what you do is you take the
three components of space
and add one more of time

579
00:38:34,490 --> 00:38:36,430
and form a vector,
the four components.

580
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:42,220
And we will agree that the Nazi symbol
for a space time vector is a capital x.

581
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:46,540
No, I've been catalysts in my writing.
Sometimes they use small x and big expert.

582
00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:49,600
You guys should be little more careful.
Big x like this,

583
00:38:49,601 --> 00:38:54,400
but no subscript will stand for this.
Four numbers is afford vector.

584
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:55,550
It's affordable,

585
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:59,350
creates a vector living in space time
and when you go to another frame of

586
00:38:59,351 --> 00:39:02,380
reference, the components, the photo
vector will mix with each other.

587
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:06,940
Then we are going to
define A. Dot. Product

588
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:13,930
is going to be funny. Dot. Product
is going to be called X. Dot.

589
00:39:13,931 --> 00:39:17,800
X usual dot. Product was some of
the squares of the components,

590
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:23,160
but this funny dot product will be equal
to x large square minus the length of

591
00:39:25,001 --> 00:39:29,050
the special parts square.
Pardon me?

592
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:33,880
This is a big x.
These are all small.

593
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:38,500
Big X is the name for the
vector of the four components.

594
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:42,700
It's the position back to it
in space time. Uh, these are,

595
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:48,150
this is the same as writing x squared
minus x one square minus x squared minus x

596
00:39:49,241 --> 00:39:50,074
three square.

597
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,700
Suppose there are two events.
One occurs at the spacetime coordinate x.

598
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:02,670
A second event occurs at a new point I,
let me call it x Bar,

599
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:06,180
whose time coordinator as
zero bar was positioned.

600
00:40:06,181 --> 00:40:10,590
Coordinate this unfortunate that
vector ours with a bar on it.

601
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:13,380
Yeah.

602
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:16,350
These are like two vectors
in the x y plane. You and I,

603
00:40:16,351 --> 00:40:19,470
if you're going to literally each other
will not agree on the components of this

604
00:40:19,471 --> 00:40:20,610
are the components of that,

605
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:25,470
but we will agree on X. Dot. X Prime.

606
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:31,890
In other words, x dot. X will be the
same as x prime dot. Expired praying.

607
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:37,930
What I'm saying is if you go
to moving frame of reference,

608
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:43,660
the components of the vector x
goes into X.

609
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:47,410
Prime was at x zero
prime and some art frame

610
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:54,760
and likewise the comp, the backlit
x bar as new components export,

611
00:40:54,761 --> 00:40:59,290
praying which at x zero
bar praying and our bar,

612
00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:02,850
right
look,

613
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:06,630
it's a story is the same like
in two dimensions. Components.

614
00:41:06,631 --> 00:41:10,140
The vectors are arbitrary.
It Bailey with the frame of reference,

615
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:14,700
but the dot product of vectors is the
same no matter how you rotate your axes.

616
00:41:15,090 --> 00:41:17,230
Because dark product is
length of eighth and length,

617
00:41:17,270 --> 00:41:20,970
the Times cosine of the angle between
them and none of the three things changes

618
00:41:20,971 --> 00:41:22,860
when you rotate your access.
Well,

619
00:41:22,861 --> 00:41:27,480
this is the analog of the dot product in
spacetime because this is the guy that,

620
00:41:27,481 --> 00:41:30,720
same for everybody.
You can say,

621
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:35,930
why don't you study this combination?
It's so nice. She was all pluses.

622
00:41:35,931 --> 00:41:40,070
I like that. I don't study that because
that combination is not special.

623
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:42,860
If I have one value for the combination,

624
00:41:42,861 --> 00:41:45,650
you will have a different value for the
combination. It does nothing privileged.

625
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:49,700
It's the one with a minus signs in it
that has a privileged role of playing the

626
00:41:49,701 --> 00:41:50,780
role of the dark product.

627
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:55,010
So space time is not
Euclidean Euclidean space.

628
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:58,640
The space in which we live and distance
squared is the sum of the squares of all

629
00:41:58,641 --> 00:41:59,474
the coordinates.

630
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:04,370
It's a pseudo euclidean space in
which to find the invariant link,

631
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:06,170
you've got a square,
some components,

632
00:42:06,171 --> 00:42:08,810
and subtract from them the
square of some other components.

633
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:17,400
Okay. So finally,

634
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:21,760
if you would take a difference vector now,

635
00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:24,240
other were take the
difference of two events,

636
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:29,490
then this patient
coordinator according to me,

637
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:31,290
the difference in space coordinate,

638
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:37,760
namely c times Delta t swear

639
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:42,660
minus delta x,
where would it be?

640
00:42:43,410 --> 00:42:48,270
Seed time to Delta p Prime Square
Wayne has built, takes brains with

641
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:52,470
odd. If you like x, not

642
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:58,200
square minus x one square will be x,

643
00:42:58,201 --> 00:43:03,201
not prime squared minus x one crimes
where I'm using the rotations back and

644
00:43:04,711 --> 00:43:04,921
forth.

645
00:43:04,921 --> 00:43:08,610
So you get used to writing the space
name coordinates in two different ways.

646
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:12,930
So it not only works for coordinates
but for coordinate differences.

647
00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:17,550
You understand two events occur,
one here now in one there later.

648
00:43:17,551 --> 00:43:22,020
Let's say they're separated in time by
two meters that separated in, I'm sorry,

649
00:43:22,021 --> 00:43:26,910
in space by two meters and time
by 11 seconds. Uh, I'm sorry,

650
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:31,380
I didn't mean to write this.
I meant to write delta x

651
00:43:33,570 --> 00:43:38,570
squared minus Delta x one
squared equal to delta x,

652
00:43:39,271 --> 00:43:43,350
not frame square minus
delta x one prime suite.

653
00:43:50,110 --> 00:43:54,190
So do you guys follow the
meaning of the statement some?

654
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:57,250
Most things are relative
distance between events,

655
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,760
relative time interval
between eventuality,

656
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:05,380
but this combination somehow is in
billion. Everybody agrees on what it is.

657
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:12,260
Okay.
Now we are going to understand the space.

658
00:44:12,290 --> 00:44:13,123
I'm in trouble.

659
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:14,593
Okay.

660
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:21,450
Delta squared as a name for a small
artist based and miserable formed or the

661
00:44:21,451 --> 00:44:26,340
differences. Now we are going to
apply this to the following problem.

662
00:44:28,650 --> 00:44:32,340
I'm going to give you a feeling for what
space I'm in trouble when applied to

663
00:44:32,341 --> 00:44:33,810
the study of a single particle.

664
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:40,340
So previously delta x and Delta t but
separation between two random unrelated

665
00:44:41,131 --> 00:44:42,540
events are arbitrary events.

666
00:44:42,870 --> 00:44:47,670
But now I want you to consider the
following event you had as a particle in

667
00:44:47,671 --> 00:44:52,320
space time and it moves there.
This is better. This the beginning.

668
00:44:52,710 --> 00:44:53,820
That's the way I did this at the end.

669
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:58,080
So now I want delta x to be

670
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:01,590
distance.

671
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:03,333
Okay?

672
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:04,620
Logical travels

673
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:14,080
and I want Delta t to be the
time in which it did this.

674
00:45:19,790 --> 00:45:20,310
Okay,

675
00:45:20,310 --> 00:45:24,060
so these are two events in the life
of a particle to events laying on the

676
00:45:24,061 --> 00:45:26,410
trajectory of a product
in the [inaudible] plain.

677
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:30,660
You draw a line is a trajectory because
at every time that it's an accident that

678
00:45:30,661 --> 00:45:35,661
described particle motion and this is
the delta x and this is the Delta t.

679
00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:41,700
Let's look at the space time
interval between the two events.

680
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:48,780
Delta s square will be c Delta
t squared minus delta x squared,

681
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,020
but we are going to
rewrite this as follows,

682
00:45:58,960 --> 00:45:59,793
uh,

683
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:06,400
equals Mc Delta t squared times one minus

684
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:11,090
v Square Overseas Square.

685
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:14,630
That v is delta x over Delta t

686
00:46:17,470 --> 00:46:19,710
because these are the two he
mentioned the life of a party,

687
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:22,690
the distance over time,
it's actually the velocity of the product.

688
00:46:25,890 --> 00:46:29,910
I would always use v for the velocity of
a particle that I'm looking at and you

689
00:46:29,911 --> 00:46:33,660
for the velocity difference between my
frame of reference and your frame of

690
00:46:33,661 --> 00:46:34,410
reference.

691
00:46:34,410 --> 00:46:38,940
So you is always the speed between frames
and v is the speed of some particular

692
00:46:38,941 --> 00:46:43,940
I'm looking at. So let's take the
square root of both sides and be fine.

693
00:46:43,941 --> 00:46:48,941
Delta s equal to c Delta t times square
root of one minus B squared overseas

694
00:46:50,971 --> 00:46:51,804
square.

695
00:46:55,940 --> 00:46:56,340
Yeah.

696
00:46:56,340 --> 00:47:00,570
So the space time interval between
two events in the life of particle,

697
00:47:00,990 --> 00:47:04,080
you see times the time
difference times this factor,

698
00:47:06,730 --> 00:47:09,710
oh this is supposed to be an invariant.

699
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:14,400
By that I mean no matter who
calculates the space, I'm in trouble.

700
00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:18,530
The person's going to get the same answer.
So let's calculate the space.

701
00:47:18,531 --> 00:47:21,590
I'm in trouble as computed
by the particle itself.

702
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:27,080
What does the political thing
happened? Well, particle says,

703
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:29,980
uh,
in other words you're with the particle.

704
00:47:30,950 --> 00:47:34,180
So in your frame of reference
for the particle now.

705
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:37,103
Okay.

706
00:47:38,070 --> 00:47:40,770
The time difference
between the two events,

707
00:47:41,250 --> 00:47:45,360
let me call it some Delta
Tau and the space difference.

708
00:47:48,090 --> 00:47:52,230
What's the space difference
between the two events? Yup. Yeah,

709
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:56,760
zero because as far as the
particles concerned, I'm still here.

710
00:47:56,930 --> 00:48:00,450
So if I'm moving from my vantage,

711
00:48:01,110 --> 00:48:02,190
my x coordinates,

712
00:48:02,191 --> 00:48:04,810
wherever they chose to put it in the
beginning and that's where it'll follow.

713
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:09,840
So the two events particle cited here
in particle cited there have different x

714
00:48:09,841 --> 00:48:12,150
coordinates for a person to
whom the particles moving.

715
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:14,990
But if your co moving with the
particle then you are like,

716
00:48:15,010 --> 00:48:17,760
you are x coordinate as seen by you.
Does not change.

717
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:20,160
Therefore delta x is zero.

718
00:48:20,850 --> 00:48:25,680
Therefore the space time interval
will be simply see times Delta Tau,

719
00:48:26,190 --> 00:48:30,090
but Tau is the time measured by
a clock going with the party.

720
00:48:33,490 --> 00:48:34,510
So Delta Tau

721
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:39,520
is the time in particles frame

722
00:48:41,310 --> 00:48:43,480
other words.
If the particle had its own clock,

723
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:50,160
that's the time it will say has
elapsed between the two points than its

724
00:48:50,861 --> 00:48:54,910
trajectory. So it's not so
hard to understand. So I
am the product line moving.

725
00:48:55,090 --> 00:48:59,080
I'm looking at my watch and I'm saying
with time will pass for me, right?

726
00:48:59,081 --> 00:49:03,190
One second, two seconds. That's the time
according to me. If you guys see me,

727
00:49:03,250 --> 00:49:06,520
you will disagree with me on how far
a mood and how much time it took.

728
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:10,930
That's your delta x and your Delta t.
But for me there's only Delta Tau.

729
00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:12,190
There is no delta x for me.

730
00:49:13,030 --> 00:49:18,030
So the space time interval when you
described particle behavior is essentially

731
00:49:18,761 --> 00:49:20,650
the time elapsed according to the party.

732
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,880
So it's not hard to understand
why everybody agrees on that.

733
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:30,680
See you and I don't have to agree on
how much time elapsed between when the

734
00:49:30,681 --> 00:49:32,330
particle was here and when it was there.

735
00:49:33,110 --> 00:49:36,740
But if we ask how much time
elapsed according to the particle,

736
00:49:37,010 --> 00:49:40,640
we're all asking the same question.
That's where we all get the same answer.

737
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:46,010
So the spacetime interval is called the
proper time. Proper time is another name.

738
00:49:49,110 --> 00:49:52,890
Well at the time as measured by
a clock caddied with the party.

739
00:49:54,510 --> 00:49:56,370
So let's write it this way.

740
00:49:56,430 --> 00:50:01,430
The space time interval is really see
times Delta Tau and Delta Tau is also an

741
00:50:03,151 --> 00:50:05,760
invariant.
Namely everyone agrees on Delta Tau.

742
00:50:10,070 --> 00:50:13,070
And what's the relation
between Delta t and Delta Tau?

743
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:16,760
Delta t is the time
according to any old person.

744
00:50:17,060 --> 00:50:20,810
And Delta Tau is the time according
to the clock. Then you saw that, uh,

745
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:25,160
the space time interval.
See Delta Tau.

746
00:50:25,830 --> 00:50:26,663
Okay,

747
00:50:28,470 --> 00:50:29,520
what's equal to

748
00:50:31,630 --> 00:50:36,140
so delta t famous squared
or the one minus B squared,

749
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:39,190
c squared. So I'm, we are going to,

750
00:50:39,250 --> 00:50:42,540
I'm starting to see cancels on
both sides. This, the relations.

751
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:52,010
So I will be using the fact
that ditto over Dt is equal.

752
00:50:53,461 --> 00:50:56,760
The square root of one minus B squared.
C squared,

753
00:50:57,330 --> 00:51:02,330
r d t over detail is one over square
root of one minus B squared equals c

754
00:51:03,421 --> 00:51:06,900
squared.
In other words,

755
00:51:06,901 --> 00:51:11,640
the time elapse between two events in
the life of a particle as seen by an

756
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:16,380
observer for whom it has a velocity
compared to as seen by a clock moving with

757
00:51:16,381 --> 00:51:18,780
the particle.
That ratio is given by this

758
00:51:20,810 --> 00:51:23,130
as the particle speeds up.
Let's see if it makes sense.

759
00:51:23,430 --> 00:51:25,740
As we approached to see this
number of brought to zero,

760
00:51:26,730 --> 00:51:30,840
that means you can say it took aquatic
has been traveling for 30 hours,

761
00:51:31,290 --> 00:51:32,820
but with this number almost vanishing,

762
00:51:32,821 --> 00:51:35,130
the particle books have been
traveling for a very short time.

763
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:36,420
That's the way it is.

764
00:51:37,110 --> 00:51:40,980
The particular always think it took less
time to go from here to there compared

765
00:51:40,981 --> 00:51:44,910
to any other observer because the clock
runs fastest in his own restaurant.

766
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:52,390
Okay, no, this is the new video, but I'm
going to use to develop the next step.

767
00:51:52,391 --> 00:51:53,530
The next step is the following.

768
00:51:54,350 --> 00:51:59,350
You Newtonian mechanics particles
had a position x and maybe y and Z,

769
00:51:59,531 --> 00:52:03,910
but let me just say x. Let me take
one more. If that accident it had y

770
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:07,900
and these were varying with time,

771
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:16,920
then I formed a vector r
because I f times x times y

772
00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:26,290
and the vector is mathematically defined
as an entity with two components so

773
00:52:26,291 --> 00:52:27,700
that when you rotate the axes,

774
00:52:27,730 --> 00:52:32,590
the component's going to experiment
with frame which are related to x and y.

775
00:52:32,591 --> 00:52:35,560
But the cost leaders and scientists
that defined to be a vector.

776
00:52:37,710 --> 00:52:40,950
Oh, if I went to you and said, okay,
that's one vector, the position vector,

777
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,990
can you point to me another vector?
Anybody?

778
00:52:45,991 --> 00:52:50,400
No other vectors in Newtonian mechanics.
Yes sir.

779
00:52:51,630 --> 00:52:56,560
You don't have any other vectors
in the good old mechanics days.

780
00:52:56,561 --> 00:52:58,320
So the only vector
you've seen his position,

781
00:52:59,270 --> 00:53:00,310
we lost the

782
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:02,960
very good, yeah, that's right.
So you're right to do that.

783
00:53:03,090 --> 00:53:05,560
You got to use certainly know the
answers so you shouldn't hesitate.

784
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:08,020
So how do you get to
velocity from position?

785
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:12,180
You take the data with this,
you've got to ask yourself,

786
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:17,040
why does the act of taking [inaudible]
off a vector of produce and other vector

787
00:53:18,410 --> 00:53:22,410
and what's the date of it to you changed
the guy by some Delta and you divide by

788
00:53:22,411 --> 00:53:23,244
the time.

789
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:27,710
Well changing the is obviously vector
because difference of two vectors,

790
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:32,610
a vector dividing by time. It's like
multiplying by the reciprocal of the time.

791
00:53:32,930 --> 00:53:36,300
It's like multiplying by number and
I've told you multiplying a vector by a

792
00:53:36,301 --> 00:53:40,920
number also gives you a vector
maybe longer or shorter. Therefore,

793
00:53:41,670 --> 00:53:46,290
Delta r is a vector because it's the
difference of our later minus are now

794
00:53:46,950 --> 00:53:47,820
dividing by Delta.

795
00:53:47,821 --> 00:53:51,270
T is the same as multiplying by 10,000
or a hundred thousand or a million.

796
00:53:51,271 --> 00:53:52,104
It doesn't matter.

797
00:53:52,170 --> 00:53:55,450
That's also a vector and the limit
is also a vector that fourth.

798
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:57,720
Then you take an end of it
[inaudible] you get it back.

799
00:53:58,210 --> 00:53:59,043
Okay,

800
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:04,570
and then you can, once you got this
date of it tube, it becomes addictive.

801
00:54:04,571 --> 00:54:07,540
You can take second delivery to sentence.
You said you can have acceleration.

802
00:54:08,350 --> 00:54:12,810
Then you can get, you can take the
acceleration multiplier mass by a mass.

803
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:14,890
No,
that is called a scaler.

804
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:18,520
The massive particle is a number
that everyone will agree on.

805
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:21,090
It does no bad action.
Yeah,

806
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:24,820
so the product of a number and the vector
is another vector and that vector of

807
00:54:24,821 --> 00:54:26,650
course is the force.

808
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:32,110
So Detroit is a vectors and
multiples of vectors by scalers,

809
00:54:32,140 --> 00:54:35,800
namely things that don't change when you
rotate your axes are ways to generate

810
00:54:35,801 --> 00:54:36,634
vectors.

811
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:42,120
So what I wanted to do is
I want to generate more
vectors because they only four

812
00:54:43,151 --> 00:54:47,650
vector I have is the position
for vector with this. This guy,

813
00:54:47,651 --> 00:54:51,640
capital x
was competence.

814
00:54:51,641 --> 00:54:56,641
I write for you again our x not witness
coordinator for CT and x one which is

815
00:54:58,391 --> 00:55:01,780
coordinating for x and you can put
the other components if you like.

816
00:55:04,410 --> 00:55:05,243
Okay.

817
00:55:05,310 --> 00:55:10,310
Now take this x to be the coordinate in
space time of an object that's moving

818
00:55:12,110 --> 00:55:16,710
and I want to take the date of it to
have that to get myself something.

819
00:55:16,711 --> 00:55:21,711
I could call the velocity vector
in relativity but the of cannot be.

820
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:23,120
The time did have it.

821
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:30,770
You guys have to understand that if
I take these things of course, uh,

822
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:32,760
in spacetime,
the particles moving,

823
00:55:32,790 --> 00:55:35,470
I can certainly tell you where
it is at one time in bed.

824
00:55:35,471 --> 00:55:37,460
It is a little later and
I can take time to it too,

825
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:42,090
but the time that have active of a
vector in four dimensions is not a vector

826
00:55:43,050 --> 00:55:44,760
because time is like any other component.

827
00:55:44,761 --> 00:55:47,790
Now it's like taking the white date of it,
the Webex,

828
00:55:48,090 --> 00:55:49,200
that doesn't give you a vector.

829
00:55:49,460 --> 00:55:52,890
You've got to take a debt of it to the
Spec to somebody that does not transform.

830
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:54,930
That is not changed from
one observer to the other.

831
00:55:56,910 --> 00:55:59,730
So you have any idea
where I'm going with this?

832
00:56:01,130 --> 00:56:04,880
Yes.
Pardon me?

833
00:56:05,110 --> 00:56:07,410
Do you like the space?

834
00:56:08,180 --> 00:56:08,480
Yes.

835
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:12,850
Are you can take data to with respect to
the time as measured by the clock with

836
00:56:13,030 --> 00:56:15,570
the moving with the polycom.
So you can take the Tau Delta with two,

837
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:19,550
in other words, let the particle
move some more Moen, Delta x,

838
00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:25,690
namely Delta x, Delta x one x two, etc.

839
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:30,190
That difference will also plans from
like a vector. We have seen many,

840
00:56:30,191 --> 00:56:35,020
many times differences in support in a
transform like electric divided by this

841
00:56:35,021 --> 00:56:35,854
guy,

842
00:56:36,410 --> 00:56:37,243
oh,

843
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:43,150
which is the time according to
a clock moving with the party.

844
00:56:44,330 --> 00:56:47,930
Everybody agrees on that because
we're not asking how much time elapsed

845
00:56:47,931 --> 00:56:49,430
according to you are according to me.

846
00:56:49,490 --> 00:56:51,380
We are going to quarrel
about that indefinitely.

847
00:56:51,770 --> 00:56:54,830
We are asking how much time passed
according the particle itself.

848
00:56:55,670 --> 00:56:57,050
Then no matter who computers at a time,

849
00:56:57,110 --> 00:56:59,780
you will get the same answer and
that's what he wanted divided by.

850
00:57:01,510 --> 00:57:02,343
Yeah,

851
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:05,780
so I'm going to form a new
quantity called velocity,

852
00:57:06,890 --> 00:57:10,700
which is the dead of it to off.
This is to toe.

853
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:18,240
Then I'm going to use the
chain rule and write it as Dex,

854
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:22,710
Dt Times Dt.
Ditto.

855
00:57:23,970 --> 00:57:28,260
That becomes Stan one over
one minus V squared overseas,

856
00:57:28,261 --> 00:57:32,260
Square Times d x,

857
00:57:32,270 --> 00:57:34,080
not the t,

858
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:38,790
the x one d t d x Two d, t, et cetera.

859
00:57:40,310 --> 00:57:41,143
Okay,

860
00:57:43,820 --> 00:57:47,720
so you find the rate of change as measured
by a clock moving with the particle

861
00:57:47,721 --> 00:57:51,380
and that has the virtue that
watch you get out of this process.

862
00:57:51,740 --> 00:57:54,200
We'll also be afforded vector.
By that,

863
00:57:54,201 --> 00:57:58,580
I mean it's four components will
transform any go to moving frame.

864
00:57:58,970 --> 00:58:02,080
Just like the four components of X.
Yeah.

865
00:58:02,590 --> 00:58:06,270
You remember when you took x and y and
they rotated the axes experiments excos

866
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:08,890
scientists, why sign and
so on. If you take time.

867
00:58:08,891 --> 00:58:12,820
Bit of it is we would find the [inaudible]
or the velocity in the rotated frame

868
00:58:13,050 --> 00:58:16,150
will be the later the x and y in the old
frame by the same core science in the

869
00:58:16,151 --> 00:58:18,520
same signs.
Because the act of taking derivatives,

870
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:21,460
that doesn't change the
way the object transforms.

871
00:58:21,970 --> 00:58:25,450
So this is my new four vector.
In fact,

872
00:58:25,451 --> 00:58:29,700
let me put the third guy
to a dx three over DT.

873
00:58:31,910 --> 00:58:32,470
Yeah.

874
00:58:32,470 --> 00:58:36,580
So what I did was I took the towel
data to for which we don't have good

875
00:58:36,581 --> 00:58:39,230
intuition and ordered in
terms of a tea date of it too,

876
00:58:39,430 --> 00:58:43,360
which we have a good intuition because
no matter how much I understand tells you

877
00:58:43,361 --> 00:58:46,460
about space and time,
we think of time as different from space.

878
00:58:46,461 --> 00:58:50,200
So we think in terms of time derivatives,
but to form a four dimensional vector.

879
00:58:50,201 --> 00:58:52,150
It's not enough to do
that is what I'm saying.

880
00:58:53,140 --> 00:58:56,440
Everybody turned that is divided by this
because that's the way of Rewriting d

881
00:58:56,441 --> 00:58:59,230
by d towers.
DVDT times this factor.

882
00:59:00,710 --> 00:59:01,220
Yeah,

883
00:59:01,220 --> 00:59:03,290
so now I am ready to define

884
00:59:05,060 --> 00:59:08,810
what I'm going to call momentum
in relativity.

885
00:59:08,870 --> 00:59:11,660
It's going to be called the Ford momentum.
Everything is the for something.

886
00:59:12,410 --> 00:59:15,620
The four vector port position.
This is called the four velocity.

887
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:17,713
Okay.

888
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:20,910
No, I'm going to define
something called the forward.

889
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:29,270
The forward momentum is going to be the
mass of a particle when it's sitting at

890
00:59:29,450 --> 00:59:32,030
rest multiplied by this velocity.

891
00:59:36,140 --> 00:59:39,470
So what does it going to be?
Let me write it out.

892
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:44,660
What does the x not over Dt. You
guys remember x Nordic. We'll set,

893
00:59:47,570 --> 00:59:48,403
sorry,

894
00:59:53,550 --> 00:59:58,140
x not with CT and x. Not
over. DT will be equal to c.

895
00:59:58,830 --> 01:00:01,740
You're right, if that's what you
were saying. I agree with you. Yes.

896
01:00:02,250 --> 01:00:03,480
So this is a vector,

897
01:00:04,020 --> 01:00:09,020
m zero c all in one minus
v squared over c squared.

898
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:14,510
Then the other guy,
other components,

899
01:00:14,511 --> 01:00:19,511
let me write simply as m zero times the
family at velocity times one minus B

900
01:00:19,821 --> 01:00:20,830
squared over c square.

901
01:00:24,030 --> 01:00:26,700
If you want it to keep the x,
Y and z velocities,

902
01:00:26,701 --> 01:00:29,940
you can keep them as a vector or if he
just wanted to live in two dimensions,

903
01:00:29,941 --> 01:00:31,770
one space in one time,
drop the arrow.

904
01:00:33,660 --> 01:00:36,660
So we have manufactured now a new beast.

905
01:00:37,410 --> 01:00:41,280
It's got four components.
What is it?

906
01:00:42,390 --> 01:00:44,340
I modeled it after the old momentum.

907
01:00:44,820 --> 01:00:48,270
I took the mass and multiply it by what
it's going to pass forward velocity in

908
01:00:48,271 --> 01:00:51,180
my new world and I got this
creature with four parts.

909
01:00:52,050 --> 01:00:53,850
You've got to understand
what the four parts mean.

910
01:00:54,870 --> 01:00:56,970
It's got a part that looks
like an ordinary vector.

911
01:00:58,290 --> 01:00:58,650
Yeah,

912
01:00:58,650 --> 01:01:00,990
and it's got a part that
is no vectors in it.

913
01:01:01,980 --> 01:01:06,780
Completely in analogy with the fact that
x had a park that looked like a vector

914
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:11,710
aimed at three spacial components and
apart that in the old days was called a

915
01:01:11,711 --> 01:01:13,320
scaler because it didn't transport.

916
01:01:13,860 --> 01:01:15,810
But of course in the new
world everything got mixed up.

917
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:18,570
We got to know who this is and
we have to know who this is.

918
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:21,540
So I want to show you what they are.

919
01:01:26,620 --> 01:01:31,620
So he had is my new for vector m zero c
over one minus B squared or c square and

920
01:01:35,780 --> 01:01:40,780
m zero let me drop the other
components except yesterday.

921
01:01:41,041 --> 01:01:43,230
Aesthetics.
Let me not worry about that now.

922
01:01:44,580 --> 01:01:45,120
Yeah,

923
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:48,330
I I wrote that because I want to be
able to call it the force vector.

924
01:01:48,450 --> 01:01:51,750
It's crazy to call this afforded vector,
I should call it a two vector.

925
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:55,230
Do you guys have to say about it is seen
two vectors. We have seen two vectors.

926
01:01:55,260 --> 01:01:59,740
Next white plain, this is a two
back that in space time audits,

927
01:02:00,060 --> 01:02:04,200
part of this big four component
object with the Ford of actor in four

928
01:02:04,201 --> 01:02:05,130
dimensional space time.

929
01:02:06,670 --> 01:02:09,880
So we have created something and we
are trying to understand what we have

930
01:02:09,881 --> 01:02:12,190
created. So I, let me
look at this guy first.

931
01:02:13,690 --> 01:02:18,310
This guy looks like m Zero
v divided by this factor.

932
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:22,500
I don't know what it stands for,
but I say,

933
01:02:22,501 --> 01:02:26,550
well relativistic physics should
reduce the Newtonian physics.

934
01:02:26,580 --> 01:02:28,380
When I look at slowly moving optics,

935
01:02:28,950 --> 01:02:33,480
because we know Newton was perfectly right
when he studied slowly moving optics.

936
01:02:34,110 --> 01:02:37,320
If I go to a slowly moving up there,
so we oversee becomes negligible,

937
01:02:38,370 --> 01:02:42,450
I dropped that and that becomes MV.
I know that the whole momentum,

938
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:49,680
so this guy is just the all
momentum properly corrected
for relativistic theory.

939
01:02:50,841 --> 01:02:55,750
So this quantity here deserves
to be called momentum. Little P,

940
01:02:55,990 --> 01:02:58,600
you can put an Arrow on it if you want
to keep the three components that don't

941
01:02:58,601 --> 01:02:59,434
put an arrow.

942
01:02:59,770 --> 01:03:00,603
Okay,

943
01:03:03,870 --> 01:03:07,800
so that's off that four vector.
The three components are just momentum,

944
01:03:07,801 --> 01:03:09,390
but not defined that the old way.

945
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:12,840
It's not am not be [inaudible]
m not divided by this.

946
01:03:15,510 --> 01:03:18,900
So the moment that the particle
is very interesting in relativity,

947
01:03:20,010 --> 01:03:21,900
even though nothing can
go faster than light,

948
01:03:22,410 --> 01:03:25,440
that doesn't mean the momentum has
an upper limit m zero times. See,

949
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:30,300
because the momentum is not mass times
velocity mass divided by this crazy

950
01:03:30,301 --> 01:03:33,240
factor.
So as you approach the speed of light,

951
01:03:33,780 --> 01:03:36,540
as we approached to see the
denominator is very close to zero,

952
01:03:36,810 --> 01:03:38,790
this number can become as big as you like.

953
01:03:39,780 --> 01:03:42,270
So we had people building
bigger and bigger accelerators.

954
01:03:42,271 --> 01:03:44,190
If you ask them how fast
is your particle moving?

955
01:03:44,550 --> 01:03:46,670
But everybody in Fermi lab in cern,

956
01:03:46,950 --> 01:03:51,270
it's all close to the velocity
of light is 99.9999 other person,

957
01:03:51,300 --> 01:03:54,390
a few more nines. Nothing is
impressive and you look at velocity,

958
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:56,160
but when you look at the momentum,

959
01:03:56,670 --> 01:03:59,940
it makes a big difference how much of the
one you have subtracted in the bottom.

960
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:04,140
If you only got a different than 19
decimal place where you got a huge moment.

961
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:08,670
So particles have limited velocity
in relativity but unlimited momentum.

962
01:04:10,110 --> 01:04:15,110
It also means the speed up this particle
is going to take more and more force as

963
01:04:15,181 --> 01:04:18,000
it picks up speed.
In other words,

964
01:04:18,570 --> 01:04:21,420
you'll be pushing it like crazy.
It won't pick up speed,

965
01:04:21,421 --> 01:04:24,210
but there's momentum will be going up.
You'll pick up speed,

966
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:27,990
but let's pick up in speed will be
imperceptible because in the 19th decimal

967
01:04:27,991 --> 01:04:29,460
place of the oversea,

968
01:04:29,930 --> 01:04:33,330
it will go from nine nine nine nine nine
nine nine for something near the end

969
01:04:33,390 --> 01:04:36,870
that the last day. That will change.
But the woman will change a lot.

970
01:04:37,350 --> 01:04:41,430
But I don't want to stop before looking
at this guy so we don't know who this is.

971
01:04:41,490 --> 01:04:42,570
So we take this thing.

972
01:04:43,630 --> 01:04:48,600
This is the zero component of p just
like I called it x, not in the old days,

973
01:04:48,601 --> 01:04:49,830
I'm going to call it peanut.

974
01:04:50,490 --> 01:04:55,490
Peanut was m zero c divided by
one minus B squared overseas.

975
01:04:57,650 --> 01:05:02,080
So I don't know what to make
of this guy either. [inaudible]

976
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:03,680
t equal to zero.

977
01:05:04,430 --> 01:05:09,430
I get m zero see that looked like the
mass of a particle but I have no idea.

978
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:12,170
Okay, so it's the mass
of particles. See here.

979
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:16,790
Then I put B equals zero in the bottom
because the top had a v and not the

980
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:22,090
something was leftover that looked like
something familiar. Namely momentum here.

981
01:05:22,091 --> 01:05:24,670
If I take the equal to zero too quickly,

982
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:28,330
what's leftover is nothing reminiscent
of anything in Newtonian mechanics.

983
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:32,650
So you want to go in what's called
the next audit and we oversee,

984
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:36,490
you don't want to totally ignore it.
You want to keep the first non zero term.

985
01:05:36,970 --> 01:05:41,970
So we write it as m zero c times one
minus via screwed overseas square to the

986
01:05:43,481 --> 01:05:44,770
power.
Minus one half.

987
01:05:47,050 --> 01:05:50,320
I've just written it with the thing
upstairs for the minus one half is the

988
01:05:50,321 --> 01:05:54,190
exponent. Then I didn't mind you.
The good old Formula One plus extra.

989
01:05:54,191 --> 01:05:57,280
The end is one plus
annex, plus dot, dot, dot.

990
01:05:58,090 --> 01:06:03,070
If x is very small,
so if you use that,

991
01:06:03,610 --> 01:06:08,610
you get m zero c times one
plus B squared or what?

992
01:06:08,731 --> 01:06:11,890
Boosie square plus higher powers
of B squared overseas square.

993
01:06:20,210 --> 01:06:23,390
So what are these terms coming out?
Well, there's the first time for a bit.

994
01:06:23,420 --> 01:06:26,510
I have absolutely no intuition.
The second term,

995
01:06:26,511 --> 01:06:31,100
it looks like one half
MV squared divided by c.

996
01:06:35,030 --> 01:06:37,760
So the for the first time
I see something familiar.

997
01:06:38,660 --> 01:06:40,580
I see the good old Kennedy energy,

998
01:06:41,030 --> 01:06:43,760
but not quite because
have this number see here.

999
01:06:44,420 --> 01:06:47,290
So I decided maybe I
shouldn't look at peanut,

1000
01:06:47,650 --> 01:06:51,200
but I should look like look at c times
p not maybe that looks something more

1001
01:06:51,201 --> 01:06:55,880
familiar that looked like an Nazi
square plus one half Mv Square.

1002
01:06:56,420 --> 01:06:59,660
That's more than what trends depending
on higher ed and higher ed powers to be

1003
01:06:59,661 --> 01:07:00,494
squid overseas.

1004
01:07:00,510 --> 01:07:01,343
Okay.

1005
01:07:02,180 --> 01:07:03,710
But now we know who this guy is.

1006
01:07:05,180 --> 01:07:08,660
This is what we used to call the
kinetic energy of a particle.

1007
01:07:08,661 --> 01:07:12,590
By virtue of his motion.
As the particle picks up speed,

1008
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:16,610
the Kennedy going to d itself receives
more corrections because the other terms

1009
01:07:16,611 --> 01:07:19,040
with more and more powers.
So we oversee or not negligible,

1010
01:07:19,041 --> 01:07:22,610
you got to put them back in basically
up to compute this object. Exactly.

1011
01:07:22,970 --> 01:07:24,860
But a low velocity is,
this is the main term.

1012
01:07:26,260 --> 01:07:31,260
So this is what led Einstein and mainly
him to realize that this quantity is

1013
01:07:34,551 --> 01:07:36,230
talking about the energy of an object.

1014
01:07:37,250 --> 01:07:37,640
Okay.

1015
01:07:37,640 --> 01:07:41,540
This is certainly energy recognize
I can put it to good use, right?

1016
01:07:41,541 --> 01:07:43,070
You run windmills and so on.

1017
01:07:43,071 --> 01:07:47,660
With kinetic energy are a hydro electric
power is from churning kinetic energy

1018
01:07:47,661 --> 01:07:51,410
or water into work. So you figure
this is also part of the energy.

1019
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:55,010
So the first conclusion of my insane
was even a particle that is not moving

1020
01:07:55,490 --> 01:07:57,740
seems to have an energy and
that's called the rest energy.

1021
01:08:00,500 --> 01:08:01,910
If the particle is moving,

1022
01:08:02,840 --> 01:08:06,320
then go back to the
derivation and you can find,

1023
01:08:06,690 --> 01:08:10,220
see at times peanut is m
Nazi squared over this thing.

1024
01:08:10,221 --> 01:08:13,460
This is the full expression for
the energy of a moving party,

1025
01:08:13,940 --> 01:08:16,700
not the approximate one. If you keep
the whole thing, this is what you get.

1026
01:08:19,310 --> 01:08:21,020
So this has been a particle moves.

1027
01:08:21,530 --> 01:08:24,500
It's got an energy that looks like
some velocity dependent defendant,

1028
01:08:24,501 --> 01:08:28,520
mass times c square. And when the party
glisses rested, it's got that energy.

1029
01:08:28,521 --> 01:08:32,000
And that's the origin of the big formula,
relating energy and mass.

1030
01:08:34,130 --> 01:08:37,910
So it leaves open the possibility that
even a particular at you think Vienna

1031
01:08:37,911 --> 01:08:40,310
particulates at rest you
have squeezed everything.

1032
01:08:40,311 --> 01:08:43,160
You couldn't get out of the party.
Like what more can I do for you?

1033
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:46,760
You give it all it's garden and stock.
But I caught him Einstein,

1034
01:08:46,761 --> 01:08:47,930
that is a lot of fun left.

1035
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:50,960
You can do something more if
there's a way to destroy this.

1036
01:08:52,820 --> 01:08:55,370
So in his theater, he doesn't
tell you how you should do that,

1037
01:08:56,270 --> 01:09:00,650
but it did point out that if you can get
rid of the mass because it was energy,

1038
01:09:00,651 --> 01:09:04,160
some other form of energy
mistake its place by the law
of conservation of energy.

1039
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:09,130
So that's how we all the nuclear
reactions work and nuclear reactions. Uh,

1040
01:09:09,140 --> 01:09:12,830
you can take two parts, like two
hydrogen atoms, hydrogen nuclei.

1041
01:09:13,310 --> 01:09:17,630
You can fuse them into helium and you
will find the helium's mass is less than

1042
01:09:17,631 --> 01:09:22,310
the mass of the two parts. So that is
some energy missing, some mass missing.

1043
01:09:22,340 --> 01:09:25,730
That means some energies missing.
That's the energy released in fusion.

1044
01:09:26,630 --> 01:09:30,770
Or you can take uranium nucleus and give
it a tap and break it up into Barium

1045
01:09:30,771 --> 01:09:34,700
and Krypton and some nutrients and you
will find the fragments together and have

1046
01:09:34,701 --> 01:09:36,050
a mass less than the parent.

1047
01:09:36,680 --> 01:09:40,040
And the missing mass times c squared is
the energy of the reaction that comes

1048
01:09:40,041 --> 01:09:43,600
out in the kinetic energy of
the fast moving particles.

1049
01:09:44,570 --> 01:09:45,350
So Einstein,

1050
01:09:45,350 --> 01:09:48,710
this wrongly called the father of the
bomb because this is as far as you went,

1051
01:09:49,250 --> 01:09:51,740
didn't specify how they
extract energy from mass,

1052
01:09:51,890 --> 01:09:56,870
but showed very clearly that rest energy
that a particular address seems to have

1053
01:09:56,900 --> 01:10:01,250
a term that should be called energy
because this guy certainly is. Yes.

1054
01:10:02,730 --> 01:10:06,590
Uh,
we'll be three over eight m zero B,

1055
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:10,610
the for over c to the fourth. Uh, I
don't carry more terms in my head,

1056
01:10:10,611 --> 01:10:12,770
but I can crank them out needle,

1057
01:10:15,100 --> 01:10:18,380
they are more corrections to
kinetic energy. In other words,

1058
01:10:18,890 --> 01:10:21,800
why is this an important concept?
If two particles collide,

1059
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:23,720
we believe energy is conserved.

1060
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:27,170
So you want to add the energy
before and competitive energy after.

1061
01:10:27,550 --> 01:10:30,710
If you want them to perfectly match.
If you stopped here,

1062
01:10:31,190 --> 01:10:34,340
your bookkeeping will not work
before will not equal after.

1063
01:10:34,970 --> 01:10:38,300
You've got to keep all this infinite
number of terms to get it exactly right.

1064
01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:41,270
But if you're satisfied to one
part in a million or something,

1065
01:10:41,271 --> 01:10:45,230
maybe that's as many terms as are needed.
And at very low velocities,

1066
01:10:45,410 --> 01:10:48,800
you don't even need that because this
is never changing in a coalition.

1067
01:10:48,830 --> 01:10:52,370
Every particle as restaurants,
this is what we balanced when we collided.

1068
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:56,270
Remember we call it a blocks and
we balanced the kinetic energy.

1069
01:10:57,170 --> 01:10:59,960
Actually that energy is there in
every block, but it's not changing.

1070
01:11:00,170 --> 01:11:02,240
It's canceling out in
the before and after.

1071
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:05,380
So unless the two blogs
annihilated and disappeared,

1072
01:11:05,410 --> 01:11:08,470
then you really have
something interesting. But
you don't have that in, uh,

1073
01:11:08,890 --> 01:11:11,570
the Newtonian physics.
Okay.

1074
01:11:11,571 --> 01:11:16,380
So I should tell you that I've
given you guys a two more problems.

1075
01:11:16,381 --> 01:11:19,470
One of which is optional.
You don't have to do that,

1076
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:23,670
but it's a very interesting problem and
I want you to think about it because

1077
01:11:23,671 --> 01:11:27,090
it's a problem whether there's a two
rockets headed towards each other,

1078
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:31,760
both have the same lengths. They one
meter and this guy thinks he is at rest.

1079
01:11:32,110 --> 01:11:35,100
The second rocket is
zooming past him like this.

1080
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:38,190
When the tail of this rocket
pass to the tip of this,

1081
01:11:38,580 --> 01:11:43,260
he sends out a little torpedo aimed at
this one. Clearly it doesn't do any harm,

1082
01:11:44,010 --> 01:11:47,430
but looking at it from the point of
view of this person, this person says,

1083
01:11:47,431 --> 01:11:50,850
well I am a big rocket.
I'm moving like this.

1084
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:55,340
And then when my tail met
the tip of this rocket ice,

1085
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:58,650
he sent out an explosive,
which are certainly hit me down here.

1086
01:12:00,270 --> 01:12:03,510
So the question is,
does this upper rocket get attack?

1087
01:12:03,660 --> 01:12:06,500
Does it get hit by the lower one or not?
From one point of view,

1088
01:12:06,510 --> 01:12:10,350
you miss the other point of view when
you expand this one in shrink. This one.

1089
01:12:10,650 --> 01:12:13,870
You definitely got to it. So
you've got to ask. I mean,

1090
01:12:13,900 --> 01:12:17,010
do you get hit or don't get it? You
cannot have two answers to one question.

1091
01:12:17,790 --> 01:12:20,160
So I've given the problem,
we've given you a lot of hymns,

1092
01:12:20,161 --> 01:12:23,550
and I think even though it's optional,
if you do that problem,

1093
01:12:23,610 --> 01:12:25,740
you've got nothing to fear.
Okay?

1094
01:12:25,990 --> 01:12:29,310
We'll give you a good practice and how
to think clearly about any number of

1095
01:12:29,311 --> 01:12:33,030
these problems. And I've given you
enough hints on how to do that.
