00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760
LAURENCE MORONEY: At Google, we
have lots of developer events.

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.040
And today, I'm talking
with Megan Krilanovich,

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.010
along with her special guest,
who makes many of them happen.

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:16.960
So Firebase always has
great representation

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.444
at events like Google I/O. We
have our own summits and lots

00:00:20.444 --> 00:00:21.110
of other things.

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:23.300
And Megan, you're the one
that drives all of this.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.680
You're the brains behind it all.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:25.305
What's it like?

00:00:25.305 --> 00:00:26.846
MEGAN KRILANOVICH:
It's pretty great.

00:00:26.846 --> 00:00:28.790
So I think I have
one of the best jobs

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:34.640
ever, which is that I help
our engineers and our product

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.550
managers get out to events
and talk to developers

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:38.640
throughout the year.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.150
So we go to about 100,
150 events every year--

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:43.316
LAURENCE MORONEY: That many?

00:00:43.316 --> 00:00:43.816
Wow.

00:00:43.816 --> 00:00:46.700
MEGAN KRILANOVICH: --and
send hundreds of Firebasers

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.650
to these events
every year, as well.

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.950
LAURENCE MORONEY: Wow.

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:50.699
And one of the things
that Firebase always

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:53.300
seems to be synonymous with
at events is great swag.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.633
MEGAN KRILANOVICH: That is true.

00:00:54.633 --> 00:00:56.570
We do have some
pretty great swag.

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.810
There's a Firebase hot sauce,
which is one of my favorites.

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:01.790
And now we've started
doing annual additions.

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.310
So we're hoping that they kind
of become collector's items--

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:07.790
or, at least, I've
started to collect them.

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.830
One of my other favorites
was the Firebase sweatband.

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.340
So, you know, it's a lot
of work being a developer.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.140
When you start coding, you know,
you get hot, you get sweaty,

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.710
and you need your
sweatband to keep cool.

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.010
LAURENCE MORONEY: So we've
seen that great video of David.

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:21.720
He's covering himself
from head to toe--

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:21.806
MEGAN KRILANOVICH: That's right.

00:01:21.806 --> 00:01:22.880
LAURENCE MORONEY: --in
these sweatbands, right?

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.620
So it's like-- so, would you
recommend developers do that?

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:26.870
MEGAN KRILANOVICH: Absolutely.

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.690
You know, whatever you
need to do to code hard.

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.480
LAURENCE MORONEY: So I was
speaking at an event in the UK

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:33.334
earlier this year.

00:01:33.334 --> 00:01:35.750
And you remember we sent, like,
a whole bunch of hot sauce

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:36.080
there?

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.710
MEGAN KRILANOVICH: Mm-hmm.

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.320
LAURENCE MORONEY: And it didn't
quite go according to plan.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:40.444
MEGAN KRILANOVICH: Oh, man.

00:01:40.444 --> 00:01:45.110
I think that the truck that it
was being shipped on actually

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.430
went off the side of the road.

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.320
I think everyone was OK.

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.657
But the hot sauce was not, so
it never made it to that event.

00:01:51.657 --> 00:01:53.240
LAURENCE MORONEY:
And so, you ended up

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.250
shipping a whole bunch
of hot sauce to me.

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:56.030
MEGAN KRILANOVICH: That's true!

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.530
LAURENCE MORONEY: And I packed
my suitcase full of hot sauce

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:59.632
to go to the UK--

00:01:59.632 --> 00:02:00.590
MEGAN KRILANOVICH: Yep.

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.600
LAURENCE MORONEY: Let's just
say Security gave me, like,

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.370
a very interesting expression
when they were scanning my bag,

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.880
so--

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.000
MEGAN KRILANOVICH: But this
is the true Firebase spirit.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.289
Anything for our developers.

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.870
You know, we always want
to go the extra mile.

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.710
And if that means packing
hundreds of bottles

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:18.320
of hot sauce in your
suitcase, then that's

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:19.240
what we've got to do.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.060
LAURENCE MORONEY:
And I have to say,

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.580
I kept some of the
hot sauce at home--

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.706
MEGAN KRILANOVICH: Oh, good.

00:02:21.706 --> 00:02:23.360
LAURENCE MORONEY: --and my wife
makes amazing chicken wings

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.870
with it.

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.230
So we have to try it some time.

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.760
And one of these
days, I'm going to do,

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.218
like, a Firecast on how to make
chicken wings with Firebase

00:02:29.218 --> 00:02:29.910
hot sauce.

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.460
MEGAN KRILANOVICH: I-- yes.

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.127
I would love to be a
guest on that show.

00:02:33.127 --> 00:02:35.084
LAURENCE MORONEY: We'll
bring them and put them

00:02:35.084 --> 00:02:37.270
in the middle of the table.

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.200
So, one of the things
also, with Megan--

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.045
I don't know if you can see
on camera, but Megan, like--

00:02:41.045 --> 00:02:41.150
MEGAN KRILANOVICH: Oh, yeah.

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.780
LAURENCE MORONEY:
--brings Didi--

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:43.290
MEGAN KRILANOVICH: Here, Didi.

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.030
[KISSING NOISES] Come on.

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.460
LAURENCE MORONEY: --with her.

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.418
And, like, Didi is almost,
like, Google-- like,

00:02:46.418 --> 00:02:47.459
our Firebase mascot dog.

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.250
MEGAN KRILANOVICH: She
is the Firebase dog.

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.800
You know, Google is
very dog-friendly.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.600
And I worked with Firebase
before the Google acquisition.

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.966
And when we came to Google,
I kept telling everyone

00:02:58.966 --> 00:03:00.090
that they should get a dog.

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.060
And then I realized, maybe
I should just get the dog.

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.550
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.040
And then Didi came
along and loved you.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.825
MEGAN KRILANOVICH: She did.

00:03:04.825 --> 00:03:05.480
LAURENCE MORONEY:
You know, even,

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.146
like, her ear, she
has one up, one down.

00:03:07.146 --> 00:03:08.639
It reminds me of
the Firebase logo.

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:09.930
MEGAN KRILANOVICH: That's true!

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.472
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Did she inspire it?

00:03:11.472 --> 00:03:13.680
MEGAN KRILANOVICH: You know,
I would like to say yes.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.490
But I don't think
that's the case.

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:17.280
We'll just say she
embodies Firebase.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.696
LAURENCE MORONEY:
OK, sounds good.

00:03:18.696 --> 00:03:20.030
So she's just a--

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:21.190
just a darling little dog.

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.372
So she definitely
embodies Firebase.

00:03:23.372 --> 00:03:24.830
Now, you mentioned
you came as part

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.000
of the Firebase acquisition.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.520
So what was it like going
from, like, start up to then

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:29.810
being part of Google?

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.900
MEGAN KRILANOVICH: It was a
pretty great journey, you know.

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.020
I joined one year
before acquisition,

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:37.250
so I was there a year.

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.240
And from then, we grew from
seven employees to over 20.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.220
And then we were
acquired by Google.

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:48.730
So I always say that tech years
are kind of like dog years.

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.375
So it's about a 7:1 ratio.

00:03:50.375 --> 00:03:51.250
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:52.650
MEGAN KRILANOVICH: So
time moves very quickly.

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.040
LAURENCE MORONEY: So a lot
has changed since you were--

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.955
MEGAN KRILANOVICH:
A lot has changed.

00:03:55.955 --> 00:03:57.000
LAURENCE MORONEY: --became
part of Google, you know.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.333
MEGAN KRILANOVICH: That's right.

00:03:58.333 --> 00:03:59.900
We used to bake
cookies in our own--

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.862
in our own kitchen,
back in the old days.

00:04:02.862 --> 00:04:05.070
And, you know, things like
that don't happen anymore.

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:06.800
But we still have a
lot of fun as a team.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.090
LAURENCE MORONEY: Now we can
just go to a micro kitchen

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:09.298
and take some cookies, right?

00:04:09.298 --> 00:04:10.790
MEGAN KRILANOVICH:
That's correct.

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:12.290
LAURENCE MORONEY: So to--
back to events for a second.

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.150
So, like, one of the things
that, all these events,

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.358
from small to large, like,
all the way up from, like,

00:04:16.358 --> 00:04:19.550
G2G Meetups, to Google I/O, and
that kind of stuff, it's like--

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:22.700
it's a big logistic issue
getting the right speakers

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.250
to go to the right events so
that we can support and love

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.910
our community.

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:28.700
And it's like, how is it
that you managed all of this?

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.391
It sounds so difficult.

00:04:30.391 --> 00:04:32.390
MEGAN KRILANOVICH: know,
it takes a lot of time,

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:35.870
and a lot of it is just
about taking care of each

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:39.445
and every one of our speakers,
and the awesome Googlers that

00:04:39.445 --> 00:04:40.820
go to these events,
so that, they

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.220
can keep going to as
many events as possible

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:44.072
throughout the year.

00:04:44.072 --> 00:04:45.780
LAURENCE MORONEY: Do
you have a favorite?

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:46.680
MEGAN KRILANOVICH:
A favorite event?

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:47.130
LAURENCE MORONEY: Yeah.

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:48.560
MEGAN KRILANOVICH: Oh, man.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.510
You know, there's some
that we've been going

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:53.330
to forever, like, some of the--

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.402
some college hackathons that
we go to, year after year.

00:04:56.402 --> 00:04:58.610
And so I really like some
of these ones that are just

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:59.777
Firebase tradition to go to.

00:04:59.777 --> 00:05:01.401
LAURENCE MORONEY:
And it's great, like,

00:05:01.401 --> 00:05:02.840
to work with students, like--

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:03.425
MEGAN KRILANOVICH: It is.

00:05:03.425 --> 00:05:05.310
LAURENCE MORONEY: --to
see them getting started,

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:06.770
and beginning their
journey, right?

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:08.269
MEGAN KRILANOVICH:
It's really cool.

00:05:08.269 --> 00:05:11.630
And some of the things that they
build in, you know, 24-48 hours

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:12.674
is absolutely amazing.

00:05:12.674 --> 00:05:14.090
LAURENCE MORONEY:
So beyond, like,

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:16.215
the hackathons and college
hackathons, obviously we

00:05:16.215 --> 00:05:18.860
have the big events like Google
I/O, and that kind of stuff.

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.039
Any good ones coming up
that you're working on?

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:22.580
MEGAN KRILANOVICH:
Well, we are going

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:25.569
to have an event on
October 31 in Amsterdam,

00:05:25.569 --> 00:05:26.360
in the Netherlands.

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:27.040
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Halloween in Amsterdam!

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:29.500
MEGAN KRILANOVICH: We're
super excited about this.

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.360
We'll be sending a huge
portion of the Firebase team,

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:37.580
lots of really great sessions,
and instructor-led trainings,

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:39.470
and office hours.

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:43.040
And so, developers
will get to have

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.707
just a whole day with
the Firebase team,

00:05:44.707 --> 00:05:46.123
and ask any questions
that they've

00:05:46.123 --> 00:05:47.420
been storing up over the year.

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:49.160
LAURENCE MORONEY: We did a
great one last year in Berlin.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.950
And it was, like, there
were-- so many people went.

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:52.340
And it was a fabulous
event, right?

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:52.830
MEGAN KRILANOVICH: Yes.

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:54.590
LAURENCE MORONEY: So,
hoping for the same again.

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:55.280
MEGAN KRILANOVICH: Absolutely.

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:56.090
It's going to be great.

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:56.750
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:58.830
So if I'm a developer and
I want to get started,

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:00.646
what's the best
place to get going?

00:06:00.646 --> 00:06:02.270
MEGAN KRILANOVICH:
I recommend that you

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:06.260
go to firebase.google.com and
get started on our code labs.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.832
We have great code labs
for iOS, Android, and web.

00:06:09.832 --> 00:06:10.790
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:12.620
MEGAN KRILANOVICH: Or, you know,
come meet the Firebase team

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:13.650
at one of these events.

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:14.220
LAURENCE MORONEY: Sounds good.

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:15.360
MEGAN KRILANOVICH: We would
love to see you there.

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.570
LAURENCE MORONEY: So can
I go to the Amsterdam one?

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:18.944
MEGAN KRILANOVICH:
Yes, Laurence.

00:06:18.944 --> 00:06:20.730
If I'm going, you're
going, Laurence.

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:22.460
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Sounds good to me.

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:23.930
So thanks, everybody,
for watching this episode

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:25.070
of "Coffee With a Googler."

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:27.690
And thanks, Megan, and thanks,
Didi, for being our guests.

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:29.410
And as you heard,
there's so many events.

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:30.410
They're always going on.

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:32.870
We have, from Google
Developer groups,

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:34.700
all the way up to
things like Google I/O,

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:38.060
and this event that's coming
in Amsterdam on Halloween,

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:39.320
October 31st.

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:41.129
So check in on
firebase.google.com,

00:06:41.129 --> 00:06:42.920
and check out the links
below to learn more

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:44.654
about some of the
events, and Megan,

00:06:44.654 --> 00:06:46.320
the person who's
making them all happen.

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:48.550
So, thanks again, Megan.
