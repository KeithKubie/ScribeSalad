00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:08.090
Little pearls swimming in a creamy custard
flavored with vanilla or lemon, many of us

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:21.750
have fond (and others not so fond) childhood
memories of tapioca pudding.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.589
Although this staple dessert of the 1970s
went out of vogue for a while, today it’s

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:27.589
making a comeback.

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:32.460
You may not know, however, that the tapioca
we use is a refined product whose parent plant

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.250
is filled with dangerous toxins that, absent
proper preparation, can result in cyanide

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.580
poisoning and possible death.

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:45.350
Cassava, the plant from which tapioca is made,
was one of the first domesticated more than

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.079
12,000 years ago in South America.

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:51.890
Migrating northward, it became a staple crop
for people throughout the pre-Columbian Americas.

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.280
Taken to Africa by the Portuguese, today it
is the third largest source of carbohydrates

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.020
in much of the world, after rice and maize.

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.940
Hardy and nutritious, cassava, also called
yuca (which is distinct from the yucca plant),

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.650
refers to the shrub as well as the starchy
root that is harvested for food.

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.280
There are different varieties of cassava,
but generally they are split into two general

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.040
classifications: sweet and bitter.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:23.860
Although both are toxic, bitter cassava may
have as much as 400 mg of cyanogenic glycosides

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:29.210
per kilo, potentially 8 times more toxic than
sweet cassava.

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.250
Cyanogenic glycosides are present in a startling
number of plants cultivated for human consumption,

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.939
and more than 2,000 known plants total.

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:41.820
Not inherently toxic, cyanogenic glycosides
are transformed within humans and animals

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.939
after the plant tissue has been macerated,
when enzymatic hydrolysis by beta-glucosidase

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:52.159
releases hydrogen cyanide, the chemical that
is toxic to people.

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:56.320
(Cyanide poisoning works by not allowing the
body to use oxygen, mainly via inhibiting

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.159
the cytochrome c oxidase enzyme.

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:04.700
So the blood remains oxygenated after it passes
through your body and back to the lungs.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.340
Thus, it causes the body to suffocate, even
though a person is otherwise breathing normally.)

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.900
There are several types of these cyanogenic
glycosides, including amygdalin, dhurrin,

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:24.449
linamarin, lotaustralin, prunasin and taxiphyllin,
and they are found in some pretty common foods

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:28.410
including, respectively, almonds, sorghum,
cassava and lima beans, stone fruits (think

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.130
peaches, plums, apricots and nectarines) and
bamboo shoots.

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.910
We don’t get sick from eating these products
because either by the time they reach us,

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:40.710
the toxins have been eliminated (e.g., blanched
almonds and canned, prepared bamboo shoots),

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:46.010
or we don’t eat the toxic part (e.g., the
pit of the stone fruit where the poison precursor

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.010
resides).

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.950
To prepare cassava for consumption, for the
sweet variety, mere peeling and thorough cooking

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.130
is all that is required.

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.100
However, with the bitter variety, not only
is it peeled, but the root is then grated

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.280
and soaked in water for long periods to leach
out the poisons.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.120
In addition, the grated bitter root is allowed
to remain in water until it ferments, then

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.340
it is thoroughly cooked, where this last step
in the process finally releases the remainder

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.220
of the dangerous compounds.

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.660
Properly processed, cassava is eaten grated,
as chips, and frequently ground into flour

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.670
and baked into crackers and breads.

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:21.030
To make the pearls seen here in the U.S.,
the moistened starch is pressed through a

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:26.410
sieve, and depending on the intended use (such
as in pudding or in drinks) the size may be

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:27.770
either small or large.

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:31.810
However, when the plant is not properly treated,
cyanide poisoning can occur.

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.440
Symptoms include a drop in blood pressure,
rapid pulse and respiration, headache, dizziness,

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.250
pain, vomiting, diarrhea, confusion and even
convulsions.

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:45.310
A lethal dose is in the range of 0.5 to 3.5
mg per kilo, with children being particularly

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.350
at risk due to their small size (and big appetites).

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:52.870
Sometimes, relatively low doses of toxins
remain in prepared cassava, such that people

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.910
are unaware, at least at first, that they
are consuming it.

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:01.070
This may lead to chronic cyanide intoxication,
which can result in thyroid and neurological

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:18.720
problems, among 
other issues.
