00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.154
Jackhammers, jet engines,
nuclear weapons.

00:00:04.154 --> 00:00:07.521
Are they the best,
most loudest sounds of all time?

00:00:07.521 --> 00:00:10.191
What is the loudest sound possible?

00:00:10.191 --> 00:00:12.931
To find out the limit,
all aboard the BOAT.

00:00:12.931 --> 00:00:15.598
[BOAT]

00:00:15.598 --> 00:00:18.245
Sound is a series
of pressure waves.

00:00:18.245 --> 00:00:20.149
When it travels
through a material like air,

00:00:20.149 --> 00:00:23.191
there are periods of compression
and rarifaction,

00:00:23.191 --> 00:00:25.396
where the molecules
are pushed closer together

00:00:25.396 --> 00:00:27.396
or pulled further apart.

00:00:27.396 --> 00:00:30.272
The distance between each of these periods
is the frequency,

00:00:30.272 --> 00:00:34.313
and it determines the pitch,
whether the sound is high or low.

00:00:34.313 --> 00:00:38.747
What humans call "sound"
goes from about 20 cycles a second

00:00:38.747 --> 00:00:41.487
to 20,000 cycles a second.

00:00:41.487 --> 00:00:45.040
This sine wave is currently going
through the entire range.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.849
But enough about pitch—
let's talk about power.

00:00:47.849 --> 00:00:51.793
The amplitude of a sound wave determines
how loud we perceive it to be.

00:00:51.793 --> 00:00:54.858
Zero decibels is the beginning
of human hearing.

00:00:54.858 --> 00:00:57.854
It's about the sound of a mosquito
ten feet away.

00:00:57.854 --> 00:01:02.308
Thirty decibels is a quiet whisper,
and a telephone's dial tone

00:01:02.308 --> 00:01:04.308
is at about 80 decibels.

00:01:04.308 --> 00:01:06.720
If you stand three feet away
from a power mower,

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.776
you'll hear about 107,
and a rock concert can clock over 115.

00:01:12.776 --> 00:01:16.909
At 125 decibels,
physical pain occurs,

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:20.740
and 100 feet from a jet engine,
you'll hear 140.

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.267
Now, at 180 decibels,
hearing tissue dies instantly.

00:01:25.267 --> 00:01:27.267
But what's the limit?

00:01:27.267 --> 00:01:31.235
Well, it turns out that a sound wave
can only be so loud

00:01:31.235 --> 00:01:33.255
based on the material
it's traveling in.

00:01:33.255 --> 00:01:35.577
A sound wave can cause
a lot of compression,

00:01:35.577 --> 00:01:38.874
but it can only cause a rarifaction
equal in magnitude

00:01:38.874 --> 00:01:42.333
to the pressure of the rest
of the material around it, like air.

00:01:42.333 --> 00:01:46.536
And so at sea level on Earth,
that's about 14 pounds per square inch,

00:01:46.536 --> 00:01:49.926
which equates to about 191 decibels.

00:01:49.926 --> 00:01:52.666
Of course, in different material,
the limit is different.

00:01:52.666 --> 00:01:56.126
For instance, underwater,
sounds can get really loud.

00:01:56.126 --> 00:02:00.584
The pistol shrimp creates a sound
of 218 decibels

00:02:00.584 --> 00:02:02.584
to stun its prey.

00:02:02.584 --> 00:02:06.639
It does this by snapping a claw
that shoots water so quickly

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:10.029
it forms a cavitation bubble—
an empty zone

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:12.606
full of a little bit of water vapor
that is crushed

00:02:12.606 --> 00:02:15.184
by the entire weight of the ocean.

00:02:15.184 --> 00:02:18.829
With that much pressure collapsing it,
a cavitation bubble can be crunched

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:21.894
and cause a momentary,
fraction of a second temperature

00:02:21.894 --> 00:02:23.894
greater than the surface of the sun.

00:02:23.894 --> 00:02:26.491
Of course, it is so short lived
and such a small event,

00:02:26.491 --> 00:02:29.533
it's a relatively low-energy event
and wouldn't really hurt humans.

00:02:29.533 --> 00:02:33.593
So let's move on to larger events—
things that cause pressure so intense,

00:02:33.593 --> 00:02:36.774
we can't really even call them sound anymore,
but shock waves,

00:02:36.774 --> 00:02:38.774
and measure them in Richter.

00:02:38.774 --> 00:02:43.405
Now, the Richter scale is logarithmic,
which means that each incremental change up is huge.

00:02:43.405 --> 00:02:47.631
A large hand grenade produces a shock wave
at about 0.2 Richter,

00:02:47.631 --> 00:02:52.823
but, Tsar Bomba, the largest atomic weapon
ever detonated by mankind,

00:02:52.823 --> 00:02:57.485
released the same amount of energy
as a magnitude 8.12 earthquake,

00:02:57.485 --> 00:03:02.663
and the earthquake recently in Japan
registered at 9 on the Richter scale.

00:03:02.663 --> 00:03:07.470
An event at 10 or above
has never been witnessed by humankind,

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.370
but it's estimated that the meteorite
smacking into Earth

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.110
at the Yucatan Peninsula
that wiped out the dinosaurs,

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.777
would have been so loud,
it would have registered 12.25

00:03:18.777 --> 00:03:20.777
on the Richter Scale.

00:03:20.777 --> 00:03:23.560
At the very extreme,
we have star quakes.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.532
These events occur on dead stars
that have collapsed

00:03:26.532 --> 00:03:30.410
into neutron stars—
so dense that one little teaspoon

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.287
of their material would weigh
as much as 900 Great Pyramids of Giza.

00:03:34.287 --> 00:03:37.631
These structures go through earthquakes
just like Earth,

00:03:37.631 --> 00:03:40.533
but there's so much energy involved
that when it occurs,

00:03:40.533 --> 00:03:42.533
it's phenomenal.

00:03:42.533 --> 00:03:44.550
The largest ever recorded
was in 2004,

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:48.679
when Magnetaur SGR 1806-20
adjusted itself

00:03:48.679 --> 00:03:53.737
with a force equal to 22.7
on the Richter Scale.

00:03:53.737 --> 00:03:56.849
It happened 50,000 light years
away from Earth,

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:00.192
but if it had happened closer,
like, say, 10 light years away,

00:04:00.192 --> 00:04:05.022
which is still 60 trillion miles,
it still would have caused

00:04:05.022 --> 00:04:08.458
enough force
to have caused mass extinction on Earth.

00:04:08.458 --> 00:04:11.244
So there you go—loud stuff.

00:04:11.244 --> 00:04:13.469
