00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.860
Whether it is during a sad movie you swore you would never tear up in, or a heart-wrenching

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:07.629
break-up following your first love, crying
may seem like a strange physical

00:00:07.629 --> 00:00:11.620
response to your emotional turmoil.  Why
do we start the waterworks when we feel

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:15.570
really sad?  Is there a biological
advantage or purpose other than washing

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.310
your face or streaking your mascara?  Well
crying does not only happen when you are

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.169
emotional, there are actually three types
of tears.  Basal tears are perpetually

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:26.809
lubricating your eyes keeping them from
drying out, while reflex tears act in

00:00:26.809 --> 00:00:29.609
response to an irritant like onions or dust.

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.950
They begin a chain reaction releasing
hormones from the brain which then

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:37.200
trigger a tear response from the glands in the
eyelids. And these tears help to get rid

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.230
of the irritant.

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.890
But tears of sadness?  Strangely this
leaky face phenomenon is exclusive to

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.000
humans with a couple different theories
as to why.  And one is strikingly similar

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.860
to the reason we blush, which we
described in a previous video here.  In

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.790
many cases emotional tears are able to
act as a signal to others of our

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.170
genuine sadness or distress.  That is not
always easy to fake.  Your tears blur

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.900
your vision, essentially handicapping any
aggressive or defensive actions sending

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.570
those nearby a signal of need appeasement
or attachment.

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.260
From an evolutionary perspective, this
increases communication with those close

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.100
to you and ultimately your chance of
survival.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.600
Some experiments have even taken
photos of people crying and made copies

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.530
with the tears digitally removed.  Not
surprisingly, people rated the pictures

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.170
with tears to be more sad, while the ones
without were often confused with puzzlement,

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.070
awe or other expressions.

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.430
But what about tears of joy?  Well perhaps
they are not so different, afterall tears of

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.350
happiness may still be used as social
signals for how we feel, and are thought to

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.890
strengthen bonds between people. Also
both emotions see activity in similar

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.680
regions of the brain, such as the hypothalamus and basal ganglia

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.510
which just happen to be connected to
your tear glands.

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.810
Another theory suggests that crying is
one of your body's mechanisms to

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.130
literally shed your stress. Interestingly
reflex tears and emotional tears have

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.700
very different compositions. Emotional
tears have much higher levels of

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.780
proteins, in particular some called adrenocorticotropic hormones

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.790
which are linked to high stress levels.
And some say crying helps to release these

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.780
stress chemicals from the body, but the
research here is limited and not yet

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:11.829
conclusive.

00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:12.619
So go on,

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:13.629
have a good cry,

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:17.769
let the world know how you feel and
potentially let out that stress.

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:19.540
