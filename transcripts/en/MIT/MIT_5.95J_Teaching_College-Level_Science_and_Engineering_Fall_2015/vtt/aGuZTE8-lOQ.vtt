JANET RANKIN: All right, great.

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.300
I looked over some of the Mud
cards we had from last time.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.049
And there were some
really good questions,

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:33.750
some really good points,
and one lingering one

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.820
from the previous time
that I forgot to address.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.236
Someone said, could
we please just

00:00:37.236 --> 00:00:39.030
move the desks into
an arrangement where

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.440
we could see each other.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.420
It was a fabulous suggestion.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.430
Today we can't do it.

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.040
But I'm going to try to do
it in the future whenever

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.740
the logistics allow, because I
think you're absolutely right.

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.540
A little bit more
of a U, or a circle,

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.560
would be great for this class.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.060
So thank you for
that suggestion.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:02.040
Another one was that we didn't
get to motivation theory.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.080
And I think I mentioned
this last time,

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.650
the idea that there's a
huge amount of stuff that's

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.420
been written and
published on motivation

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.430
and theories of motivation.

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.430
And I'd be more than
happy to discuss this

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.540
as the semester goes on.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.400
And it might be a
great topic for one

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.181
of those lunches that somebody
was going to organize,

00:01:23.181 --> 00:01:24.930
one of those informal
lunches that someone

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:25.946
was going to organize.

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:31.680
Or maybe we can
carve out some space

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.200
at the end of the semester and
pop it in, take something out

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.570
and pop it in, because
it's really fascinating.

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.730
It's really interesting,
but it doesn't quite

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:40.684
fit anywhere in particular.

00:01:40.684 --> 00:01:42.100
So thank you for
bringing that up.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.050
And keep bugging me about it.

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:50.070
The other thing is someone
asked if all those learning

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.610
theories that we discussed
were equally valid.

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.140
And yes, they are equally valid.

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.960
I mean, there are situations
where being behaviorist

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.160
could help.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.910
There are situations where
being constructivist could help.

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:09.210
It depends on what you're
trying to have students learn.

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:13.110
So you want to make sure that
you tailor the way that you're

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.980
teaching to support what it
is you want students to learn.

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.480
And we'll get into that
in a lot more detail

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.270
today when we talk about
developing learning outcomes,

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.260
and then also when we
talk about tailoring

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.210
your instructional
activities to support

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:30.300
those learning outcomes.

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.720
So this class, this
particular class today

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:39.726
is a balance between developing
course design, developing

00:02:39.726 --> 00:02:41.100
intended learning
outcomes, which

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.870
for me is at the heart of it.

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.180
If you can come up
with some good intended

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.974
learning outcomes, you basically
have designed your course.

00:02:48.974 --> 00:02:49.890
And I'll show you how.

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.420
I mean, you can't just ignore
it, but that's the hard work,

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.189
and then the act of writing
constructing a syllabus.

00:02:57.189 --> 00:02:58.980
So once you've got
those learning outcomes,

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.460
you have an incredible anchor
for the rest of your course.

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:04.380
And there was just
a very timely haiku.

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:05.760
I put it on the wiki.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.860
But there's this Twitter
feed, academic haikus,

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.289
which if you want to waste
any time and read them,

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:15.330
it's a way to waste time.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.850
But there was one here,
"that question you have?

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.610
I know where the answer
is-- on the syllabus.

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.250
So it was, like I said,
it came out yesterday.

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.050
I thought it was pretty timely.

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.950
And it's true.

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.500
If you write a good syllabus,
it should really clear up

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:34.860
a lot of, not the content, not
the understanding level issues

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.230
students have, but the
issues with respect

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.710
to when's the test, do
we have to know this,

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:44.130
how will this be graded,
what's important?

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.990
All those things should
be in your syllabus.

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:49.590
So that's why that's there.

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.570
So here's a little
slide, a graph

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:56.520
that I saw a few
years ago, and I

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.180
thought it's a really good
way to start this discussion.

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:05.550
So on the y-axis we have sort
of an assessment, a proclamation

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:07.020
of students understanding.

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.030
They got it, they didn't get it.

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.490
And I think the word
in French is [FRENCH].

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:15.470
So for some reason I find it
very cool to say [FRENCH].

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:16.519
Got it.

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:17.950
I don't know.

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:20.696
So whether they get it, like
whether after the tests,

00:04:20.696 --> 00:04:23.070
you've given a test, and you
go, man, that student really

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.730
got it.

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:27.300
That student really
gets this material,

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.440
and whether they passed the
exam or failed the exam.

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.260
So the size of the
circle is more or less

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:39.132
the number of people that
fall into those quadrants.

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:47.520
So anybody surprised
by this plot?

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.520
Yes, Rachel.

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.500
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:55.480
JANET RANKIN: OK.

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:56.000
All right.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.670
Well, there's the segue.

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:02.210
So we want, we don't
want the green,

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:05.090
but we more or less
expect the green, right?

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:07.150
If you get it,
you pass the exam.

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:08.780
If you pass the
exam, you get it.

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:11.360
That's that, and we like
to have lots of people

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.220
have that happen too.

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.627
And then we also
acknowledge that somebody

00:05:15.627 --> 00:05:17.210
isn't going to get
it, and they're not

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:18.920
and they're not going
to pass the exam.

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:24.080
And that kind of maybe makes us
sad, but it's not surprising.

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.850
And then anybody
can kind of have

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:28.680
a bad day or kind of a fluke.

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.830
So sometimes, sure,
somebody will fail the exam,

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.590
and actually really
understand the material.

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:35.780
Generally speaking,
that doesn't happen,

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:38.030
and then there's
often a reason for it.

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:40.220
But it's that red
circle that Rachel

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:47.354
mentioned that is troublesome,
at the least, troublesome.

00:05:47.354 --> 00:05:48.395
So why might that happen?

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:56.170
Why so many red circles?

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:56.670
Yeah, Dave.

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:59.340
AUDIENCE: Because the test was
set up for basic memorization,

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:01.416
or you could figure
out with a lucky guess

00:06:01.416 --> 00:06:02.290
with multiple choice.

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:05.225
So you could easily pass just
with good test-taking skills

00:06:05.225 --> 00:06:06.081
or a good memory.

00:06:06.081 --> 00:06:07.080
JANET RANKIN: Excellent.

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:09.330
So you pass with sort of
good test taking skills.

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:11.460
Now I want us to
hang on to that.

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:15.060
There's an underlying
assumption in Dave's comment.

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:17.000
So I'd like to hang
on to that thought,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.857
but let's hear a few
other conjectures and see.

00:06:19.857 --> 00:06:21.940
Rachel, why do you think
you might have passed it?

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:24.648
AUDIENCE: So often I
feel like TAs are either

00:06:24.648 --> 00:06:26.106
really good or
really terrible when

00:06:26.106 --> 00:06:28.681
it comes to the exam reviews,
and they're mainly good.

00:06:28.681 --> 00:06:31.394
They often told us
too much of what

00:06:31.394 --> 00:06:32.560
was going to be on the exam.

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.350
And so then you
kind of just knew

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:36.952
what the test was going to
be if you could well on it

00:06:36.952 --> 00:06:38.266
if you [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:38.266 --> 00:06:39.550
JANET RANKIN: OK.

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:40.660
That's interesting.

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:41.484
Yes, Gordon.

00:06:41.484 --> 00:06:46.278
AUDIENCE: Yeah, it's
possible that [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:46.278 --> 00:06:50.742
tests [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:50.742 --> 00:06:54.230
When it comes to true life
situations and something

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:56.730
that [INAUDIBLE]
knowledge that was

00:06:56.730 --> 00:07:00.674
gained from that material,
then [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:03.765 --> 00:07:04.860
JANET RANKIN: OK.

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:13.020
So Gordon is sort of kind of
flirting with this idea of you

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:15.374
as the instructor, this
real life knowledge,

00:07:15.374 --> 00:07:16.290
this is what it means.

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:19.500
They have to have this practical
working knowledge for us

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:24.340
as the instructors to
say they got it, right?

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:26.650
But the exam isn't measuring it.

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:29.800
And that's exactly what, that's
what Dave was saying as well.

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:32.920
This idea that the exam
is measuring one thing,

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:36.610
but it's not really measuring
whether they got it.

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:38.380
When we go home
and think what does

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:40.900
it mean to be a good
material scientist,

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:42.659
or what does it mean
to be a good chemist,

00:07:42.659 --> 00:07:44.200
we don't think, oh,
it means that you

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:46.520
can define what a
mitochondria is,

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:49.790
or you can balance
a simple equation.

00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:57.450
And yet, we put
that on the exam.

00:07:57.450 --> 00:07:59.430
It's also a bit of
the idea that students

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:00.900
are good at taking tests.

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:03.000
They're good at gaming systems.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.180
They're good at listening to
TAs or TAs may have not given

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:07.860
out appropriate information.

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:09.750
So it comes from both sides.

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:13.620
It comes from the students and
it comes from the professors.

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:16.920
But you have control over this.

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:20.430
You shouldn't be writing
an exam that people

00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:24.090
can get a good grade on,
but then when you go home

00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:26.400
and say, oh, they got a
good grade on this test,

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:28.340
but they didn't get it.

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:32.600
You need to define what it
means to get it in your field,

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:37.789
to get this subject, whatever
it is that the test is about.

00:08:37.789 --> 00:08:42.890
And then you need to write
a test that measures that.

00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:45.920
And too many times
we don't do it.

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:48.020
We're kind of rushed,
or we don't really know.

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:49.936
We haven't really thought
about how to measure

00:08:49.936 --> 00:08:52.980
whether somebody gets it.

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:56.540
So the first step in all
this is to define what it

00:08:56.540 --> 00:09:00.520
is that means that they got it.

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:03.680
And that's the first step,
and that's the hardest step.

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:06.590
But once that's done,
the rest is easier,

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:11.042
and it will save you from this.

00:09:11.042 --> 00:09:12.521
OK?

00:09:12.521 --> 00:09:15.490
OK.

00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:19.720
So that's the topic
of today's class.

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:22.860
And if you needed a
little more motivation,

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:26.170
I'd like you to
read this paragraph,

00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:30.160
and I'd like you to tell
me what it's talking about.

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:32.800
But I'm just going to give
you about 2 and 1/2 minutes

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:34.390
to read it.

00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:36.924
And then we'll
discuss what it means.

00:09:36.924 --> 00:09:38.590
What do you think
this is talking about?

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:42.020
Yes, David.

00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:44.330
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I
think it stresses

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:51.980
about how we can arrange by say,
maybe schedules or activities

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:54.782
that put them into groups.

00:09:54.782 --> 00:10:00.718
Then maybe if we form a group,
how we plan [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:04.566 --> 00:10:05.420
JANET RANKIN: OK.

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:08.621
So arranging schedules
or activities.

00:10:08.621 --> 00:10:09.120
OK.

00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:25.370
OK.

00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:28.350
Something else?

00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:29.940
AUDIENCE: When
you're planning, how

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:34.392
to go about teaching
a module, [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:42.858 --> 00:10:44.990
JANET RANKIN: Planning teaching.

00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:47.361
What else?

00:10:47.361 --> 00:10:47.860
Anything?

00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:49.660
AUDIENCE: It's like a mailroom
operation or something.

00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:50.618
JANET RANKIN: Mailroom.

00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:00.674
Something from the back, maybe?

00:11:00.674 --> 00:11:02.488
You know you're smiling.

00:11:02.488 --> 00:11:04.400
AUDIENCE: I couldn't
think of anything.

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:05.400
JANET RANKIN: All right.

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:08.040
Well, then don't say anything.

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:13.590
AUDIENCE: The first is the
course content, the course

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:16.910
outline, and what you
are going to teach

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:18.798
the students, [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:21.594 --> 00:11:22.580
JANET RANKIN: OK.

00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:24.920
So students, grouping students--

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:25.610
Adam, right?

00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:26.671
Adam.

00:11:26.671 --> 00:11:27.170
OK.

00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:39.477
So content, arranging content.

00:11:39.477 --> 00:11:40.310
Anybody in the back?

00:11:43.485 --> 00:11:43.985
Flyer?

00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:48.030
Yes, Gordon.

00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:50.652
AUDIENCE: I think you talked
about sorting materials.

00:11:50.652 --> 00:11:52.100
JANET RANKIN: Sorting materials.

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:53.875
So we'll go with maybe sorting.

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:04.120
So if I tell you-- so these
are all great guesses.

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:06.930
They're as good
as what I'm going

00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:09.090
to tell you the answer is.

00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:11.760
So this was written to
describe the process

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:12.765
of doing your laundry.

00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:17.490
Like doing the wash.

00:12:17.490 --> 00:12:19.440
You take the clothes
and you put, maybe

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:23.130
you put the dark clothes in
one bin and the white clothes

00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:24.600
in another bin.

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:28.680
And then you fold them
and you put them away.

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:29.370
It's impossible.

00:12:29.370 --> 00:12:31.650
This happens almost
every time I show

00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:34.380
this little piece of writing.

00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:36.870
People don't generally get it.

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:39.720
They get the fact that it
has to do with sorting,

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:43.380
and some planning,
some arranging things,

00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:46.190
but they don't get that
it's about the laundry.

00:12:46.190 --> 00:12:48.660
If you skim it-- you don't
have to totally reread it--

00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:51.450
but if you skim it
with the idea that it's

00:12:51.450 --> 00:12:55.290
about doing the
laundry, you probably

00:12:55.290 --> 00:13:03.860
can understand it better, maybe.

00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:10.860
So now I'm going to ask why
did I show you this now,

00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:17.430
today, before the third, the
beginning of the third class?

00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:17.930
Yes.

00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:20.878
AUDIENCE: I think it's sort
of about arrangement of course

00:13:20.878 --> 00:13:24.091
content [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:24.091 --> 00:13:26.410
JANET RANKIN: So it could
be about how you arrange

00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:28.670
the content in the syllabus.

00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:29.170
[? Hina. ?]

00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:32.670
AUDIENCE: I think it's easy
to describe methodology

00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:34.668
as a person more in
a different field.

00:13:34.668 --> 00:13:37.905
But if there's no context
for the audience about what

00:13:37.905 --> 00:13:42.140
this is, it doesn't matter that
you've laid out everything.

00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:43.445
No one knows [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:43.445 --> 00:13:44.350
JANET RANKIN: Right.

00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:46.780
It's very detailed
at a certain level,

00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:52.420
but it's still really
hard to understand, right?

00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:53.800
Any other ideas?

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:54.300
Yes.

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:56.300
AUDIENCE: I think
it's interesting.

00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:58.300
There's a lot of value
judgements in it.

00:13:58.300 --> 00:13:59.712
Like, it's really easy.

00:13:59.712 --> 00:14:02.450
And one can never tell
with comments like that.

00:14:02.450 --> 00:14:05.052
Because I'm trained to figure
out what they're saying,

00:14:05.052 --> 00:14:07.522
it's actually just
frustrating me more,

00:14:07.522 --> 00:14:10.230
because I don't know what
they're talking about.

00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:12.271
And it's really easy--

00:14:12.271 --> 00:14:13.270
JANET RANKIN: All right.

00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:15.729
So that's a great point.

00:14:15.729 --> 00:14:17.770
So we're talking about
writing learning outcomes,

00:14:17.770 --> 00:14:19.660
about organizing the
course around writing

00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:20.570
learning outcomes.

00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:22.450
If you're using
phrases, or you're

00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:24.820
using language
that's just, there's

00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:28.960
just like throwaway words
in there or value judgments,

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:33.700
it's not doing your
students any good, right?

00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:37.690
And also, that if you have
this beautiful course that's

00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:41.320
beautifully organized even,
wonderfully organized,

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:44.230
but if you don't tell
them what it is you're

00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:45.910
trying to do with it all--

00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:47.680
what it is they're
going to be able to do

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:52.410
with it all, whatever it
is you expect them to do--

00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:55.600
they're not going to
be able to follow you.

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:58.300
So imagine a procedure
as fairly straightforward

00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:00.640
as doing the laundry.

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:02.650
Now imagine, OK,
you're going to be

00:15:02.650 --> 00:15:05.950
able to select the right,
the appropriate method

00:15:05.950 --> 00:15:14.440
to integrate equations,
so methods of integration,

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:20.770
by separation, by card or
substitution or whatever.

00:15:20.770 --> 00:15:22.990
So if you don't
tell them what it

00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:24.580
is you're expecting
them to do, even

00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:26.746
if you're very good at
explaining what it is they're

00:15:26.746 --> 00:15:30.740
going to do, they won't get it.

00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:34.570
So this is my sell for why when
you write a learning outcome,

00:15:34.570 --> 00:15:36.940
you have to write a learning
outcome that's clear

00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:40.090
and that's understandable to
the students, that doesn't have

00:15:40.090 --> 00:15:42.130
a lot of extra words
and that tells them

00:15:42.130 --> 00:15:44.220
exactly what they're
supposed to do.

00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:54.520
So I have some learning
outcomes for today

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:56.680
and I hope that they're clear.

00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:59.110
You'll be able to
describe the components

00:15:59.110 --> 00:16:03.640
of the constructive alignment
and backward design processes.

00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:05.860
And those, constructive
alignment anyway,

00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:08.290
was in the pre-class reading.

00:16:08.290 --> 00:16:10.810
You'll be able to classify
the content of a course

00:16:10.810 --> 00:16:12.010
that you might teach.

00:16:12.010 --> 00:16:17.170
So what do I expect students
to do with this content,

00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:18.770
to be able to do
with this content?

00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:22.600
You'll be able to create
measurable, specific, and

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:26.530
realistic learning outcomes
for a class you will teach,

00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:30.310
and you'll be able to state
the components of a syllabus.

00:16:30.310 --> 00:16:33.280
So I feel that those are
pretty understandable.

00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:39.500
You may disagree with me,
or maybe you want to wait.

00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:46.720
So constructive alignment, it
was in the pre-class reading,

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:48.430
right?

00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:51.930
Anybody want to just give
a brief summary of it?

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:58.210
I mean it's kind of up
here, but in your own--

00:16:58.210 --> 00:17:00.020
AUDIENCE: I think
constructive alignment

00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:09.468
is about aligning assessment,
method of assessment,

00:17:09.468 --> 00:17:12.280
with course content.

00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:15.230
[INAUDIBLE] assess
[INAUDIBLE] type of assessment

00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:18.670
so that what the teacher
has in mind, the course

00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:21.973
content or the content
I want them to get,

00:17:21.973 --> 00:17:24.329
to test it with the
assessment process.

00:17:24.329 --> 00:17:27.209
Then we would also
do the assessment,

00:17:27.209 --> 00:17:32.497
and then come up with
the intended outcome.

00:17:32.497 --> 00:17:33.330
JANET RANKIN: Right.

00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:34.913
They'll achieve the
learning outcomes.

00:17:34.913 --> 00:17:36.870
And if you do this
right, you get rid

00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:40.380
of that red circle
on that graph.

00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:44.280
You get rid of students who
did well on the assessment

00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:46.680
but don't really
know what's going on,

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:49.320
because you have
aligned the assessment

00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:53.310
with what it was you wanted
them to know or be able to do.

00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:56.100
So that's important.

00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:59.130
I just think this is a
very, very compelling image

00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:03.360
to keep in your head, that these
three things have to be linked.

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:05.964
And as I said before,
this, you will

00:18:05.964 --> 00:18:08.130
see that the top part,
writing the learning outcomes

00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:09.870
is the tricky part,
it's the hard part.

00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:13.080
It's the part that requires
a lot of thinking and work.

00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:15.010
When you get a good
learning outcome,

00:18:15.010 --> 00:18:21.090
the other two things almost
take care of themselves.

00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:22.790
OK?

00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:24.290
Did anybody have
any, does anybody

00:18:24.290 --> 00:18:26.379
have any questions
about something

00:18:26.379 --> 00:18:28.670
from the reading associated
with constructive alignment

00:18:28.670 --> 00:18:33.689
or some other idea
from the reading?

00:18:33.689 --> 00:18:34.188
Yes, Gordon.

00:18:34.188 --> 00:18:37.860
AUDIENCE: I just wanted
to make a contribution.

00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:42.344
I think that this constructive
alignment is one of the things

00:18:42.344 --> 00:18:46.005
that the intended
outcome should measure.

00:18:46.005 --> 00:19:03.262
So I think maybe that's
confusing [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:03.262 --> 00:19:06.496
and also how we can test
and be sure and confident.

00:19:06.496 --> 00:19:07.650
JANET RANKIN: Right.

00:19:07.650 --> 00:19:08.580
Right.

00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:12.620
I think the measurability part
for scientists and engineers

00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:15.390
is kind of intuitive.

00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:18.330
Like why would you say
something if you couldn't

00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:21.470
tell whether or not
it was true, or not

00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:24.060
from a scientific point of view.

00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:27.380
What's the point
of saying, making

00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:28.930
a proclamation
about what somebody

00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:31.860
should be able to do if you
can't measure it in the end?

00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:34.764
So it's comforting
to say, OK, I'm

00:19:34.764 --> 00:19:36.930
going to make learning
outcomes that are measurable.

00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:40.050
But it also can be
a bit challenging.

00:19:40.050 --> 00:19:41.010
But we'll do that.

00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:44.110
We're going to do that today.

00:19:44.110 --> 00:19:45.130
Some other comment?

00:19:45.130 --> 00:19:45.630
Nina.

00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:49.130
AUDIENCE: I guess as
far as [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:51.078
Do people write
learning outcomes that

00:19:51.078 --> 00:19:54.850
have no constructive
alignment process,

00:19:54.850 --> 00:19:57.402
like choosing to write
learning outcomes,

00:19:57.402 --> 00:20:01.080
are you going
through the prcoess?

00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:03.732
It seems decoupled a
little bit in the reading,

00:20:03.732 --> 00:20:06.504
but it seems like you can't
have one without the other.

00:20:06.504 --> 00:20:09.424
JANET RANKIN: You
owe it to yourself--

00:20:09.424 --> 00:20:11.590
and I don't know what people
do, and I guarantee you

00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:13.540
people write learning outcomes
without thinking about

00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:15.415
whether they can assess
them or measure them,

00:20:15.415 --> 00:20:19.070
I guarantee that
happens in real life--

00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:22.500
you owe it to yourself to
try very hard not to do that.

00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:23.170
OK?

00:20:23.170 --> 00:20:27.070
And I think the important
thing to do is, often we say,

00:20:27.070 --> 00:20:29.260
oh, my god, this is
the best assignment.

00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:31.300
This is the greatest question.

00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:33.400
It's this project, and
they're going to do this,

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:34.649
and they're going to whatever.

00:20:34.649 --> 00:20:36.970
They're going to
build a race car.

00:20:36.970 --> 00:20:39.550
And if you sit down
and say, well, what

00:20:39.550 --> 00:20:41.970
do I want them to
get out of that?

00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:44.850
If you can't articulate it
in a way that's consistent

00:20:44.850 --> 00:20:46.920
with your class,
consistent with the course

00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:49.350
as it sits in this
series of their courses,

00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:51.750
or as it sits in
the institution,

00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:55.620
then you either need to
rethink the assignment,

00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:59.340
rethink the project, or
think a lot harder about what

00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:03.740
learning outcomes that
activity advances.

00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:06.840
That's a very good point.

00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:08.640
It's really kind of iterative.

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:11.970
And I think it might be easier
to see with this diagram.

00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:15.660
This is another-- so John
Biggs is from the UK.

00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:19.320
And so there's sort of
the UK camp of people

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:21.030
and they like John Biggs.

00:21:21.030 --> 00:21:23.070
And then there's
Wiggins and McTighe.

00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:26.550
Grant Wiggins and Jay
McTighe are from the US.

00:21:26.550 --> 00:21:29.910
They wrote primarily for
the K through 12 audience,

00:21:29.910 --> 00:21:32.460
but it's completely applicable.

00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:35.310
And they're from the US, so they
have kind of a US following.

00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:38.620
It's just how it works.

00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:40.810
It's essentially the same thing.

00:21:40.810 --> 00:21:44.520
It's identify the results, so
the intended learning outcomes.

00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:47.070
Figure out how you're
going to get them there.

00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:51.100
So the black is Wiggins and
McTighe and the red is Biggs.

00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:53.220
So plan the learning
experiences that

00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:55.410
are going to support them,
achieving the learning

00:21:55.410 --> 00:21:59.220
outcomes, and really help you
measure whether they got them

00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:00.310
or not.

00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:02.672
And then determine
what evidence will

00:22:02.672 --> 00:22:05.130
be that acceptable evidence
that they achieved the learning

00:22:05.130 --> 00:22:07.320
outcomes and what
are the assessments.

00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:12.750
So real often we do have
this project that we want.

00:22:12.750 --> 00:22:14.130
Oh, this is a great problem.

00:22:14.130 --> 00:22:17.490
Often in thermo-- I taught a lot
of thermo-- there's like, oh,

00:22:17.490 --> 00:22:21.150
they're going to do this
double loop, double reactor

00:22:21.150 --> 00:22:25.184
cycle with the refrigerant
and a heating cycle.

00:22:25.184 --> 00:22:26.850
And it's going to be
coupled and they're

00:22:26.850 --> 00:22:29.870
going to use the output from
one for the input in the other

00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:31.350
and all this crazy stuff.

00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:34.680
Like, this is a
great assignment.

00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:36.990
And you kind of, I know
this is a great assignment.

00:22:36.990 --> 00:22:40.290
If I can't back up
from this assignment--

00:22:40.290 --> 00:22:42.330
whether or not I put
it here or here--

00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:46.490
if I can't back up and say
after a successful completion

00:22:46.490 --> 00:22:50.730
of this assignment, you
will be able to describe

00:22:50.730 --> 00:22:55.480
the components of
the Brayton cycle,

00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:59.730
you will be able to define
the increase in entropy

00:22:59.730 --> 00:23:05.250
for a system with x boundaries,
If I can't articulate

00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:08.550
those things, then I need to
either change the assignment,

00:23:08.550 --> 00:23:11.430
or, well, then I need to
change the assignment.

00:23:11.430 --> 00:23:12.180
OK?

00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:14.640
But you can start
with the activity,

00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:16.140
and then back up
and say, well, what

00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:18.960
learning outcomes does
that support, and then,

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:19.890
am I OK with that?

00:23:19.890 --> 00:23:23.140
Is that relevant to this class?

00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:26.370
So it's often a very iterative,
the arrows kind of go this way,

00:23:26.370 --> 00:23:28.038
but it's often iterative.

00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:37.800
So I had asked that you come
to class with some topics

00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:39.570
from a class you're
likely to teach.

00:23:39.570 --> 00:23:41.340
That was on the assignment page.

00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:45.300
If not, start thinking now.

00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:47.970
And so you want to have,
for most classes, most

00:23:47.970 --> 00:23:50.550
undergraduate classes,
there's a bunch of topics.

00:23:50.550 --> 00:23:53.910
You might have 10
topics, 20 topics.

00:23:53.910 --> 00:23:57.796
And I don't care right now
about the scale of the topics,

00:23:57.796 --> 00:23:58.920
whether they're really big.

00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:01.140
You probably don't want
to go with like first law,

00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:03.000
second law.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.130
That's probably a
little bit too big,

00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:12.360
but on the order
of 5 to 15 topics.

00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:14.130
Jot down the topics.

00:24:14.130 --> 00:24:16.710
And then I have a chart here.

00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:21.450
So the chart has two
sides, and the columns

00:24:21.450 --> 00:24:23.700
are Bloom's Taxonomy,
which you don't

00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:25.770
have to worry about
that specifically,

00:24:25.770 --> 00:24:29.800
but you can look at the words
that are associated with it.

00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:34.170
And then the second column
is what students should

00:24:34.170 --> 00:24:36.960
be able to do with each topic.

00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:45.660
So let's say my topic is
first law for closed systems.

00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:48.480
So I might think
about, OK, do I want

00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:51.150
them to be able to
define, to just state

00:24:51.150 --> 00:24:53.685
the first law for
closed systems?

00:24:53.685 --> 00:24:56.550
Do I want them to be able to
use the first law for closed

00:24:56.550 --> 00:24:59.520
systems in order to solve
certain kinds of equations?

00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:03.270
Do I want them to be able
to derive the first law?

00:25:03.270 --> 00:25:06.510
Do I want them to be
able, whatever it is.

00:25:06.510 --> 00:25:10.110
So you're going to look at
the columns, the categories

00:25:10.110 --> 00:25:12.657
on the left side,
and you're going

00:25:12.657 --> 00:25:13.740
to think about your topic.

00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:16.830
And you're just going to decide
which box in the middle column

00:25:16.830 --> 00:25:18.802
to put the topics into.

00:25:18.802 --> 00:25:20.760
You don't have to worry
about writing anything.

00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:26.430
You're just going to distribute
the topics to the level of,

00:25:26.430 --> 00:25:29.534
it's really cognitive
processes that are associated

00:25:29.534 --> 00:25:30.700
with the things on the left.

00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:36.990
Remember, understand, apply,
analyze, evaluate, and create.

00:25:36.990 --> 00:25:39.460
So we'll take
about five minutes.

00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:41.230
And you just do
that by yourself.

00:25:41.230 --> 00:25:43.170
And just fill in
that middle column

00:25:43.170 --> 00:25:49.050
of the table with the
topics from your course.

00:25:49.050 --> 00:25:50.890
Do you want more
explanation, Rachel?

00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:59.240
It's starting to make
you think about this part

00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:05.020
of the beginning circle.

00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:07.440
But you don't want to
write any sentences yet.

00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:10.460
But it's starting to help
you think about what are they

00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:13.830
going to do with these topics.

00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:15.130
What do I want them to do?

00:26:15.130 --> 00:26:20.350
Is it remember, or is it create
something using these things?

00:26:20.350 --> 00:26:21.290
Where is it?

00:26:21.290 --> 00:26:22.970
Those are two ends
of the spectrum.

00:26:22.970 --> 00:26:27.110
And in your chart, the
things that at the top

00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:28.940
are the more remember, right?

00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:33.260
It's more about kind of
a recall information.

00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:35.360
And then the things in
the back of the chart

00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:40.160
tend to be more higher
order cognitive processes,

00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:43.040
like synthesize, apply, create.

00:26:50.110 --> 00:26:50.609
Yes.

00:26:50.609 --> 00:26:54.281
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:54.281 --> 00:26:57.050
JANET RANKIN: So don't worry
about the third column.

00:26:57.050 --> 00:26:58.940
Don't worry about
the last column yet.

00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:00.326
We're going to do that later.

00:27:00.326 --> 00:27:01.700
So all you have
to do is just say

00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:05.410
where each topic falls loosely.

00:27:05.410 --> 00:27:05.910
OK.

00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:08.302
Does everybody have a chart?

00:27:08.302 --> 00:27:08.802
OK.

00:27:08.802 --> 00:27:10.730
AUDIENCE: Do you
want us to write

00:27:10.730 --> 00:27:12.284
as many topics as possible?

00:27:12.284 --> 00:27:13.700
JANET RANKIN: Write
as many topics

00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:17.990
as possible, but distribute
them through the chart.

00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:19.460
Right?

00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:22.352
Not everything is going
to be remember, right?

00:27:22.352 --> 00:27:24.810
So some things will be remember,
some things will be apply,

00:27:24.810 --> 00:27:27.841
some things will be analyze,
some things will be create.

00:27:27.841 --> 00:27:28.340
OK?

00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:34.451
If you have any questions,
just raise your hand.

00:27:34.451 --> 00:27:34.950
All right.

00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:36.533
So what we're going
to do is I'm going

00:27:36.533 --> 00:27:40.650
to ask you to just
keep those with you.

00:27:40.650 --> 00:27:42.630
We're going to do
another activity later

00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:44.670
on using those as
a starting point,

00:27:44.670 --> 00:27:49.860
but I want you to just
keep that sorting with you.

00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:52.800
Any comments or questions
about the experience,

00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:53.860
about what you just did?

00:27:58.330 --> 00:28:00.820
Was it easy?

00:28:00.820 --> 00:28:02.980
No.

00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:04.349
It can sometimes be a challenge.

00:28:04.349 --> 00:28:05.890
Well, what the heck
you were supposed

00:28:05.890 --> 00:28:07.002
to do with this anyway?

00:28:07.002 --> 00:28:08.710
What do I really want
them to do with it?

00:28:08.710 --> 00:28:12.460
This is the beginning
of that process whereby

00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:15.640
you define exactly what it
is you want students to do,

00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:17.532
know or be able to do.

00:28:17.532 --> 00:28:19.240
And then you can start
to think about how

00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:22.360
you're going to assess whether
or not they can do it or not.

00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:24.460
But it's very
different if I were

00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:27.040
to say I want everybody
to be able to state

00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:29.994
the first law of
thermodynamics versus I

00:28:29.994 --> 00:28:32.410
want you to be able to use the
first law of thermodynamics

00:28:32.410 --> 00:28:37.480
to define chemical, mechanical,
and thermal equilibrium

00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:40.672
in a simple composite system.

00:28:40.672 --> 00:28:41.380
That's different.

00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:42.606
That's very different.

00:28:46.110 --> 00:28:47.750
So that's what we're
starting to do.

00:28:51.170 --> 00:28:53.440
So now we have
kind of the seeds.

00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:59.530
We thought about which topics
kind of we want to have,

00:28:59.530 --> 00:29:01.690
what we want to do with
each of the topics.

00:29:01.690 --> 00:29:04.910
But now we really have to turn
them into learning outcomes,

00:29:04.910 --> 00:29:06.274
into real statements.

00:29:06.274 --> 00:29:07.690
By the end of this
class, you will

00:29:07.690 --> 00:29:13.600
be able to, by the end of this
course, you will be able to.

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:17.980
And just as an aside,
remember that sometimes you'll

00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:20.620
notice that for every class,
every session we have,

00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:22.510
I have learning outcomes.

00:29:22.510 --> 00:29:24.940
But there's also overarching
learning outcomes

00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:26.400
for the course.

00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:31.350
So I will use them
interchangeably,

00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:34.360
but they'll be at a
slightly different scale.

00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:39.160
The ones for the class are a
little bit more fine grained.

00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:41.710
As was mentioned in the reading,
and as Gordon mentioned,

00:29:41.710 --> 00:29:46.660
they have to be specific,
measurable, and realistic.

00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:49.180
If they don't have
those properties

00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:52.420
they're not going to be
particularly useful, or as

00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:54.220
useful.

00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:55.550
All right.

00:29:55.550 --> 00:30:00.550
And we'll see some examples
of that in just a sec.

00:30:00.550 --> 00:30:02.800
So here's what they're not.

00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:04.810
They're not topics.

00:30:04.810 --> 00:30:06.760
So you came with topics.

00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:10.420
You will leave today
with learning outcomes.

00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:14.470
But topics are not
learning outcomes.

00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:18.430
The first law of thermodynamics
is not a learning outcome.

00:30:18.430 --> 00:30:20.650
You need a verb with it.

00:30:20.650 --> 00:30:22.369
What do you want me
to do, what do you

00:30:22.369 --> 00:30:24.160
want your students to
do with the first law

00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:25.980
of thermodynamics?

00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:28.090
What do you want them to
know about the first law

00:30:28.090 --> 00:30:30.410
of thermodynamics?

00:30:30.410 --> 00:30:32.980
So they're not topics.

00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:34.765
They're not things
that you will do.

00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:40.900
It's easy to say, I could
have a list a mile long.

00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:47.950
I will talk about the first
law of thermodynamics.

00:30:47.950 --> 00:30:49.660
I can check that
off pretty easily.

00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:50.734
I mean I just did.

00:30:50.734 --> 00:30:52.900
I just talked about the
first law of thermodynamics.

00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:56.410
It says nothing about what
you learned about it, what

00:30:56.410 --> 00:30:58.090
your students learned about it.

00:30:58.090 --> 00:31:00.430
So it's not about you.

00:31:00.430 --> 00:31:02.840
Get over it.

00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:03.506
That was a joke.

00:31:06.447 --> 00:31:07.530
It's not value statements.

00:31:07.530 --> 00:31:11.490
As Adrian pointed out, some
of these think this is easy,

00:31:11.490 --> 00:31:16.640
this is good, this is useful.

00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:19.135
Any of those things don't
belong in a learning outcome.

00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:25.590
And it's not your hopes and
dreams for your students.

00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:28.074
I mean, ultimately, it is.

00:31:28.074 --> 00:31:30.240
You hope that they will be
able to use the first law

00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:32.340
of thermodynamics, da, da, da.

00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:34.440
But it's really about
what they're doing,

00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:36.240
about what they're going to do.

00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:39.500
So, no.

00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:40.610
Here's a little example.

00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:45.990
This is just from like an
earth and planetary course.

00:31:45.990 --> 00:31:49.700
Students will understand
plate tectonics.

00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:50.640
How's that?

00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:57.520
Is that OK for a
learning outcome?

00:31:57.520 --> 00:31:58.438
Why not?

00:31:58.438 --> 00:32:01.924
AUDIENCE: It's too broad.

00:32:01.924 --> 00:32:04.140
JANET RANKIN: It's
not very specific.

00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:07.435
What the heck about
plate tectonics?

00:32:07.435 --> 00:32:07.935
What else?

00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:13.580
AUDIENCE: Measurable.

00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:14.760
JANET RANKIN: Thank you.

00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:16.890
OK, the measurable part.

00:32:16.890 --> 00:32:23.310
This word understand,
strike it from your brains.

00:32:23.310 --> 00:32:25.150
It's a property that we love.

00:32:25.150 --> 00:32:27.120
We love understand.

00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:30.590
But you can't
flippin' measure it.

00:32:30.590 --> 00:32:32.840
You can't go in
there and measure it.

00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:35.180
You can measure lots
of things that tell you

00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:37.220
whether students
understand, but you

00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:39.500
can't measure understanding.

00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:44.307
And I think we'll see that
with some more examples.

00:32:44.307 --> 00:32:46.390
I don't think anybody is
earth and planetary here.

00:32:49.050 --> 00:32:50.664
So how about this one?

00:32:50.664 --> 00:32:52.080
Students will be
able to interpret

00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:54.240
unfamiliar tectonic
settings based

00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:59.830
on information on volcanic
activity and seismicity.

00:32:59.830 --> 00:33:02.340
Again, I don't think any
of us are geologists.

00:33:02.340 --> 00:33:04.980
But the idea that I've
told, or the person

00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:08.310
has told us what
we're going to use

00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:12.060
to interpret these
situations, and then we're

00:33:12.060 --> 00:33:15.417
going to make predictions based
on those interpretations, I

00:33:15.417 --> 00:33:17.610
mean, that's an assumption.

00:33:17.610 --> 00:33:21.426
So it's specific and
now it's measurable.

00:33:21.426 --> 00:33:22.800
Even though we're
not geologists,

00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:24.750
I suspect we can
think of how we could

00:33:24.750 --> 00:33:29.220
write a test question that
would ask students to do this.

00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:32.910
And then we could see
whether they did it or not.

00:33:32.910 --> 00:33:35.370
So that's measurable.

00:33:35.370 --> 00:33:40.715
And probably, by doing this,
by having students do this,

00:33:40.715 --> 00:33:42.840
we get a pretty good
measurement about whether they

00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:46.900
understand plate tectonics.

00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:50.877
But it's much more specific
and it's much more measurable.

00:33:58.944 --> 00:34:01.110
From here, this is from the
University of Minnesota,

00:34:01.110 --> 00:34:03.590
which has a nice website
on learning outcomes.

00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:06.680
They're not from your point
of view, as we mentioned.

00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:08.179
They're not what
you're going to do.

00:34:08.179 --> 00:34:10.345
I'm going to introduce
students to the major turning

00:34:10.345 --> 00:34:13.747
points and processes in
North American history.

00:34:13.747 --> 00:34:15.830
You can say anything you
want, but it doesn't mean

00:34:15.830 --> 00:34:17.340
the students learned anything.

00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:18.510
So it's not about you.

00:34:18.510 --> 00:34:19.760
It's what they're going to do.

00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:21.777
They're going to
list and describe

00:34:21.777 --> 00:34:24.235
the turning points and processes
in North American history.

00:34:26.871 --> 00:34:28.370
I'm going to create
an understanding

00:34:28.370 --> 00:34:30.230
of the formal constructs
of physical design.

00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:32.600
That one is like,
this one is, it's

00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:35.120
like, I don't even know
what it means, right?

00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:37.719
Create an understanding
of the formal constructs

00:34:37.719 --> 00:34:38.510
of physical design.

00:34:38.510 --> 00:34:40.670
I don't even know what it means.

00:34:40.670 --> 00:34:42.739
And so it's like
that laundry example.

00:34:42.739 --> 00:34:46.010
Your students aren't going
to know what it means,

00:34:46.010 --> 00:34:48.330
and it's not going to help them.

00:34:48.330 --> 00:34:51.469
It's not going to help
them access the material.

00:34:51.469 --> 00:34:56.000
So the ones on the left
are all teacher-centered

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.250
and they're not very useful.

00:34:58.250 --> 00:35:00.410
The ones on the right
are student-centered

00:35:00.410 --> 00:35:03.020
and they are generally useful.

00:35:03.020 --> 00:35:06.230
But there's some things wrong
with the things on the right.

00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:07.700
AUDIENCE: Understand.

00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:12.264
JANET RANKIN: Understand, yes.

00:35:12.264 --> 00:35:13.680
So what would you
write instead of

00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:17.370
understand the formal constructs
of physical design, whatever

00:35:17.370 --> 00:35:19.440
the heck that means?

00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:20.554
What might you use?

00:35:20.554 --> 00:35:22.250
AUDIENCE: Identify.

00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:24.170
JANET RANKIN: Identify.

00:35:24.170 --> 00:35:24.840
OK.

00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:30.510
That might be like a list,
right, or identify or list,

00:35:30.510 --> 00:35:32.275
pick it out of the
lineup kind of thing.

00:35:34.830 --> 00:35:36.960
This is a nice one.

00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:40.220
Explain to an intelligent
non-expert, an INE.

00:35:40.220 --> 00:35:45.240
And so explain this to somebody
who's not in the field.

00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:49.200
If you could do that, it
probably means that you get it.

00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:51.300
Somebody I know used
to say, explain this

00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:54.810
to my four-year-old brother.

00:35:54.810 --> 00:35:58.050
Explain-- what was
it-- angular momentum,

00:35:58.050 --> 00:36:01.290
to my four-year-old brother.

00:36:01.290 --> 00:36:04.380
I would argue if you can explain
it to a four-year-old kid,

00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:07.050
you probably understand it.

00:36:07.050 --> 00:36:08.820
So you can use that.

00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:21.690
Use formal constructs
to design something.

00:36:21.690 --> 00:36:23.677
I mean, that's kind
of an inversion.

00:36:23.677 --> 00:36:25.010
How about the one on the bottom.

00:36:25.010 --> 00:36:29.450
Understand gender, race,
ethnicity, socioeconomic class,

00:36:29.450 --> 00:36:32.120
understand how they have
shaped Americans' lives.

00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:36.272
Completely unmeasurable, right?

00:36:36.272 --> 00:36:37.605
So what would you write instead?

00:36:41.830 --> 00:36:43.770
AUDIENCE: Describe.

00:36:43.770 --> 00:36:46.810
JANET RANKIN:
Describe how, sure.

00:36:49.970 --> 00:36:50.695
Anything else?

00:36:50.695 --> 00:36:52.445
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
it seems like you're

00:36:52.445 --> 00:36:54.905
trying to get [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:54.905 --> 00:36:57.030
JANET RANKIN: Right.

00:36:57.030 --> 00:36:58.720
So that's a great
point, is that we

00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:05.020
don't know where this faculty
member put this on their table.

00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:07.370
We don't know whether
it really just states

00:37:07.370 --> 00:37:11.590
some ways that, list some ways
that these things have affected

00:37:11.590 --> 00:37:15.790
Americans, North Americans'
lives, or Americans' lives--

00:37:15.790 --> 00:37:18.580
which is kind of a remember
thing, just make a list--

00:37:18.580 --> 00:37:22.780
or whether it's do some
analysis on some situation.

00:37:22.780 --> 00:37:25.120
We don't know that, but
you as the instructors

00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:28.512
get to decide that
for your classes.

00:37:28.512 --> 00:37:29.720
So that's an important thing.

00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:32.480
You get to call all the shots.

00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:33.730
You get to make the decision.

00:37:33.730 --> 00:37:36.410
We can only guess about
what this person meant,

00:37:36.410 --> 00:37:38.090
and therefore, his
or her students

00:37:38.090 --> 00:37:40.420
can only guess about
what he or she means.

00:37:46.010 --> 00:37:50.870
So you have on your table this
hierarchy of Bloom's Taxonomy.

00:37:50.870 --> 00:37:55.460
It's often shown in this
triangle, this pyramid.

00:37:55.460 --> 00:38:01.310
There's a handout which has
exactly the same strata on it.

00:38:01.310 --> 00:38:06.140
And it just has some handy
dandy verbs associated with it.

00:38:06.140 --> 00:38:09.530
But Benjamin Bloom came up
with this classification

00:38:09.530 --> 00:38:15.390
of cognitive processes way
back when, in the 1950s.

00:38:15.390 --> 00:38:17.510
And it is this idea that
it is this pyramid, that

00:38:17.510 --> 00:38:20.840
at the base of the pyramid
are these ideas like remember.

00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:27.140
And those are basic cognitive
processes, remember, list.

00:38:27.140 --> 00:38:33.200
And then it moves up the pyramid
to things that require a higher

00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:35.890
level of cognitive processing.

00:38:35.890 --> 00:38:38.860
Rather than just pulling
facts out of storage

00:38:38.860 --> 00:38:41.110
and stating them, you're
going to do something

00:38:41.110 --> 00:38:42.730
with those facts.

00:38:42.730 --> 00:38:46.820
So as you go higher and
higher up the pyramid,

00:38:46.820 --> 00:38:49.090
note that he chose--

00:38:49.090 --> 00:38:53.860
really unfortunately-- to call
the second level understand.

00:38:53.860 --> 00:38:57.460
However, there are
words that can help you.

00:38:57.460 --> 00:39:00.880
If it really is understand
that you want to measure,

00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:03.400
there's words that describe
that a little bit better.

00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:04.990
They're in your
table, and they're

00:39:04.990 --> 00:39:09.280
also in that second
table that I handed out.

00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:11.650
So arrange, list, label.

00:39:11.650 --> 00:39:16.310
For understand-- describe,
relate, recognize, explain,

00:39:16.310 --> 00:39:17.020
those things.

00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:17.520
Gordon.

00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:20.204
AUDIENCE: Just a
little [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:20.204 --> 00:39:22.180
When it comes to
understand, maybe

00:39:22.180 --> 00:39:24.128
if you put it like [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:24.128 --> 00:39:25.503
JANET RANKIN:
Understand to what?

00:39:25.503 --> 00:39:27.242
AUDIENCE: Understand
to an [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:27.242 --> 00:39:30.530
Maybe that's what
we can measure.

00:39:30.530 --> 00:39:33.925
Understand to this level
or to this [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:33.925 --> 00:39:37.316
JANET RANKIN: But how, can you
give me a specific example?

00:39:37.316 --> 00:39:53.536
AUDIENCE: I wish I could go back
to the last slide [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:53.536 --> 00:39:56.500
can describe [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:59.958 --> 00:40:01.140
JANET RANKIN: OK.

00:40:01.140 --> 00:40:02.850
So I see where you're going.

00:40:02.850 --> 00:40:04.500
Does someone have a suggestion?

00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:06.010
So think about that laundry.

00:40:06.010 --> 00:40:08.010
Think about that description
of doing a laundry.

00:40:10.530 --> 00:40:12.520
Can somebody take
what Gordon said

00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:18.640
and get where he wants to
go, but get there in perhaps

00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:19.485
a more direct way.

00:40:25.751 --> 00:40:26.251
Katherine.

00:40:26.251 --> 00:40:29.730
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:29.730 --> 00:40:31.410
JANET RANKIN: Exactly.

00:40:31.410 --> 00:40:32.910
So if you're going
to do that, and I

00:40:32.910 --> 00:40:35.422
see where you're
coming from, understand

00:40:35.422 --> 00:40:37.380
so that you can describe,
in order to describe,

00:40:37.380 --> 00:40:38.580
or to the level of describe.

00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:40.530
Just forget the
understand part, and just

00:40:40.530 --> 00:40:45.900
say describe, or define,
or whatever it is you want.

00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:48.790
But yes, I mean, that
first step is saying,

00:40:48.790 --> 00:40:50.820
what do I mean by understand?

00:40:50.820 --> 00:40:57.570
And when you say that, then
it generally rewrites itself.

00:40:57.570 --> 00:41:01.650
And so the more direct you
can be, generally, the better.

00:41:01.650 --> 00:41:04.410
And keep that laundry
example in your head.

00:41:04.410 --> 00:41:04.910
Yes.

00:41:04.910 --> 00:41:10.360
AUDIENCE: You're asking
a student [INAUDIBLE]?

00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:14.729
JANET RANKIN: So I would say,
well, let's just open that up.

00:41:14.729 --> 00:41:16.770
What do you think about
that, of asking students?

00:41:16.770 --> 00:41:21.720
So do you understand this
stuff about learning outcomes?

00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:23.790
AUDIENCE: I think
as teachers, when

00:41:23.790 --> 00:41:26.123
you, in the front of the
class, you're teaching students

00:41:26.123 --> 00:41:28.740
and you say do you
understand, they say yes.

00:41:28.740 --> 00:41:34.290
But you see from psychology you
know who doesn't understand.

00:41:34.290 --> 00:41:36.870
JANET RANKIN: So David
says as I ask you

00:41:36.870 --> 00:41:38.970
that, do you understand?

00:41:38.970 --> 00:41:41.970
Most people are going to
say, hey, I understand, sure.

00:41:41.970 --> 00:41:43.290
Don't think I'm an idiot.

00:41:43.290 --> 00:41:45.930
I understand.

00:41:45.930 --> 00:41:47.670
Right?

00:41:47.670 --> 00:41:48.750
So I completely agree.

00:41:48.750 --> 00:41:51.990
Students are not likely to
say they don't understand.

00:41:51.990 --> 00:41:53.310
What else?

00:41:53.310 --> 00:42:18.205
AUDIENCE: That's difficult
for the teacher to [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:18.205 --> 00:42:20.782
JANET RANKIN: Well,
so do you want

00:42:20.782 --> 00:42:21.948
to say something about that?

00:42:21.948 --> 00:42:23.119
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I agree.

00:42:23.119 --> 00:42:24.702
I think the part
that we do understand

00:42:24.702 --> 00:42:30.546
as nonspecific is the learning
understanding [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:30.546 --> 00:42:33.450
As an instructor you
have to know, understand

00:42:33.450 --> 00:42:35.670
what you're trying
to get at, which

00:42:35.670 --> 00:42:40.010
I think is where the clicker
question is beautiful,

00:42:40.010 --> 00:42:41.510
because you know
already what you're

00:42:41.510 --> 00:42:44.616
trying to evaluate that they're
catching in class in real time,

00:42:44.616 --> 00:42:48.600
if you can see who's getting
at the nuance of what

00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:50.710
you're teaching.

00:42:50.710 --> 00:42:51.460
JANET RANKIN: Yes.

00:42:51.460 --> 00:42:54.220
I think that's an
excellent, excellent point,

00:42:54.220 --> 00:42:57.430
that many of these
activities that we do,

00:42:57.430 --> 00:43:01.810
these small group
activities, or the clicker

00:43:01.810 --> 00:43:04.450
questions or other
activities that students

00:43:04.450 --> 00:43:08.590
are doing in class are
helping them learn.

00:43:08.590 --> 00:43:11.860
But they're also formative
assessments of whether or not

00:43:11.860 --> 00:43:14.470
they get it or not, whether
or not they understand.

00:43:14.470 --> 00:43:17.470
And you as the
instructor can see it.

00:43:17.470 --> 00:43:20.080
If I walk around,
if I listen, if I

00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:23.680
look at who answered what
question on the clickers,

00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:26.320
or on the raising your hand,
multiple choice questions,

00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:30.320
whatever methods I used
here, I get a better,

00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:32.290
a much better sense
of who understands

00:43:32.290 --> 00:43:33.580
or doesn't understand.

00:43:33.580 --> 00:43:38.710
If all I'm doing is
lecturing I can't tell.

00:43:38.710 --> 00:43:41.530
And I can ask do you
understand, but they're not

00:43:41.530 --> 00:43:43.480
likely to tell me.

00:43:43.480 --> 00:43:46.240
Which is kind of the other
point is that sometimes--

00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:48.580
and I think you were
alluding to this, Gordon--

00:43:48.580 --> 00:43:52.240
that sometimes students don't
know whether they understand

00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:54.040
or not.

00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:57.880
So we need to give them the
opportunities to find out

00:43:57.880 --> 00:44:00.730
whether they understand or not.

00:44:00.730 --> 00:44:03.310
And arguably, if
you're just lecturing

00:44:03.310 --> 00:44:05.560
and you're a great lecturer--

00:44:05.560 --> 00:44:07.900
you're eloquent,
you don't stumble,

00:44:07.900 --> 00:44:11.710
the writing on the board is
awesome, all this stuff--

00:44:11.710 --> 00:44:14.350
students will think
they understand maybe

00:44:14.350 --> 00:44:17.830
when they don't,
because they're not

00:44:17.830 --> 00:44:19.840
having to confront
any misunderstanding,

00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:22.870
and it all seems very nice.

00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:25.570
So these activities where
you actually have students

00:44:25.570 --> 00:44:27.460
do something, say
something, where

00:44:27.460 --> 00:44:30.220
you ask them a specific
question, that's

00:44:30.220 --> 00:44:34.255
when you can determine whether
or not they understand or not.

00:44:36.870 --> 00:44:38.690
And because they are
not likely to say

00:44:38.690 --> 00:44:41.270
they don't understand,
either because they just

00:44:41.270 --> 00:44:43.940
don't want to admit it, or
because they really don't know

00:44:43.940 --> 00:44:45.350
whether they don't understand.

00:44:45.350 --> 00:44:48.586
So you need to give them
measurements to find out

00:44:48.586 --> 00:44:49.710
whether they get it or not.

00:44:52.698 --> 00:44:53.198
Yes.

00:44:53.198 --> 00:44:57.707
AUDIENCE: Sometimes, for
example lecture and the activity

00:44:57.707 --> 00:44:58.665
has [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:58.665 --> 00:45:02.480
For example, we have
lectures and the teacher just

00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:05.206
[INAUDIBLE] and then
we have expectations

00:45:05.206 --> 00:45:07.288
as we do exercises.

00:45:07.288 --> 00:45:12.054
So do you recommend that
we also do some activities

00:45:12.054 --> 00:45:15.000
during the lecture
or just [INAUDIBLE]?

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:17.520
JANET RANKIN: No, do
them during lecture.

00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:20.040
I mean, the model that
we're trying to do here

00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:23.010
is the model that you should
do even if you have a hundred

00:45:23.010 --> 00:45:24.390
or 200 people in your class.

00:45:24.390 --> 00:45:25.710
You can use clickers.

00:45:25.710 --> 00:45:28.634
You can use pair
share discussions.

00:45:28.634 --> 00:45:30.550
You can do all sorts of
things to break it up,

00:45:30.550 --> 00:45:32.580
and it's effective.

00:45:32.580 --> 00:45:35.850
There's a paper coming
up for next week,

00:45:35.850 --> 00:45:39.120
a meta-analysis, active
learning strategies,

00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:42.900
how they actually, students
learn more in a lecture

00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:45.630
if you actually ask them
to talk to each other,

00:45:45.630 --> 00:45:47.006
break up, share, et cetera.

00:45:47.006 --> 00:45:49.380
And I think when we talked
about misconceptions, remember

00:45:49.380 --> 00:45:51.060
that example with the coin?

00:45:51.060 --> 00:45:54.090
How many students got it,
could draw the free body

00:45:54.090 --> 00:45:57.180
diagram before and after?

00:45:57.180 --> 00:46:01.650
I mean, before and after
in a straight lecture,

00:46:01.650 --> 00:46:03.450
there's hardly
any learning gain.

00:46:03.450 --> 00:46:05.760
But if you incorporate
active learning,

00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:07.090
the learning gains go way up.

00:46:25.180 --> 00:46:26.830
So that's Bloom's Taxonomy.

00:46:26.830 --> 00:46:29.830
And an interesting take
on Bloom's Taxonomy,

00:46:29.830 --> 00:46:32.320
there's a woman,
Kathy Schrock, who--

00:46:32.320 --> 00:46:34.390
it's a nice website
and the slides

00:46:34.390 --> 00:46:36.010
we posted so you have the link--

00:46:36.010 --> 00:46:39.100
but she decided, she has
this theory that it's not

00:46:39.100 --> 00:46:40.720
really so pyramidal.

00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:42.532
That everything
really is dependent,

00:46:42.532 --> 00:46:44.740
these cognitive processes
are dependent on each other

00:46:44.740 --> 00:46:45.770
at a certain level.

00:46:45.770 --> 00:46:48.370
And so she's drawn it as
a gear, where everything

00:46:48.370 --> 00:46:50.740
sort of supports
the act of creating,

00:46:50.740 --> 00:46:51.900
which is up at the top.

00:46:51.900 --> 00:46:54.760
But the other ones are
sort of around the side,

00:46:54.760 --> 00:47:00.130
but they all contribute
to the ultimate cognitive

00:47:00.130 --> 00:47:01.470
process of creating.

00:47:01.470 --> 00:47:03.490
So that might be a nice
way to think about it.

00:47:03.490 --> 00:47:07.210
And then she's taken the
specific words, like analyzing,

00:47:07.210 --> 00:47:11.680
and said, OK, what's
an instantiation

00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:17.230
of analyzing, outlining,
deconstructing, organizing,

00:47:17.230 --> 00:47:19.030
structuring,
surveying, whatever?

00:47:19.030 --> 00:47:22.150
So it's the same idea, it's
just a different graphical

00:47:22.150 --> 00:47:23.446
representation.

00:47:27.420 --> 00:47:29.970
So what you've done is
you've taken your topics,

00:47:29.970 --> 00:47:32.220
put them in those
cells in the table.

00:47:32.220 --> 00:47:37.380
And I just want to point out
kind of how as the instructor

00:47:37.380 --> 00:47:39.510
you have a lot of
power about where

00:47:39.510 --> 00:47:41.910
you're putting those, where
you've decided to put those.

00:47:41.910 --> 00:47:44.940
And it may be different for
a first year undergraduate

00:47:44.940 --> 00:47:48.195
class, or a second or
third year graduate course.

00:47:48.195 --> 00:47:51.420
It could be the same
topic, but you're

00:47:51.420 --> 00:47:54.540
going to put them in
a different category.

00:47:54.540 --> 00:47:56.820
So that's why when I asked
you to bring a topic,

00:47:56.820 --> 00:47:59.040
it's for a specific class.

00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:02.014
It's for a specific
group of students.

00:48:02.014 --> 00:48:04.180
So let's say we take the
idea of interstitial sites.

00:48:04.180 --> 00:48:06.790
So I have a
crystalline structure,

00:48:06.790 --> 00:48:09.720
it's got an order of
periodicity of atoms.

00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:12.540
And then I have spaces
between the atoms,

00:48:12.540 --> 00:48:14.400
those are the
interstitial sites.

00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:16.742
And so I could say you'll
be able to identify

00:48:16.742 --> 00:48:17.700
the interstitial sites.

00:48:17.700 --> 00:48:19.970
So I could say where's
the tetrahedral site

00:48:19.970 --> 00:48:22.950
in a face-centered cubic
or something, whatever?

00:48:22.950 --> 00:48:27.510
And students just
really have to find it.

00:48:27.510 --> 00:48:30.180
I could say calculate
the maximum size

00:48:30.180 --> 00:48:32.490
of an interstitial
atom that could occupy

00:48:32.490 --> 00:48:34.540
that space, an ion
that could occupy

00:48:34.540 --> 00:48:37.480
that space in a particular
crystal structure.

00:48:37.480 --> 00:48:40.560
So those are two very
different levels,

00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:43.650
but it's the same topic.

00:48:43.650 --> 00:48:46.830
X-ray diffraction, I could
say apply Bragg's Law

00:48:46.830 --> 00:48:49.440
to calculate d-spacing.

00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:52.770
So that's very much a turn
the crank kind of thing.

00:48:52.770 --> 00:48:54.540
I know the equation
for Bragg's Law,

00:48:54.540 --> 00:48:56.375
I stick things in, I
solve for the unknown.

00:49:00.350 --> 00:49:03.280
I could then also ask you
to index unknown diffraction

00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:07.670
patterns, meaning identify an
unknown crystal structure based

00:49:07.670 --> 00:49:09.470
on the diffraction pattern.

00:49:09.470 --> 00:49:12.500
That's a completely
different activity,

00:49:12.500 --> 00:49:14.720
completely different
set of cognitive

00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:18.180
processes than just
using Bragg's Law.

00:49:18.180 --> 00:49:20.890
But you have to
decide what it is.

00:49:20.890 --> 00:49:24.419
And arguably, if all you've had
students do during the class is

00:49:24.419 --> 00:49:26.710
sort of problems that they
applied Bragg's Law and they

00:49:26.710 --> 00:49:29.210
solved for d-spacing-- so they
solved for the incident angle

00:49:29.210 --> 00:49:32.500
or they solved for the
wavelength or whatever it is--

00:49:32.500 --> 00:49:38.761
you really can't throw this
at them on the exam, right?

00:49:38.761 --> 00:49:41.260
Or conversely, if you spent the
whole time, they've indexed,

00:49:41.260 --> 00:49:44.860
they've been in the lab indexing
unknown diffraction patterns,

00:49:44.860 --> 00:49:48.050
and then this is the question
you ask them on the exam.

00:49:48.050 --> 00:49:51.580
Well, then you have people that
perhaps get it without really,

00:49:51.580 --> 00:49:53.680
perhaps pass the exam
without really getting it.

00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:57.530
So that's just something
to keep in mind.

00:49:57.530 --> 00:50:00.880
The other thing to
note is let's say

00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:03.424
this is my intended
learning outcome--

00:50:03.424 --> 00:50:05.590
calculate the maximum size
of the interstitial atoms

00:50:05.590 --> 00:50:09.400
in a variety of
crystal structures.

00:50:09.400 --> 00:50:11.530
How do I know whether
students get that or not?

00:50:16.641 --> 00:50:17.140
What's that?

00:50:17.140 --> 00:50:17.973
AUDIENCE: It's easy.

00:50:17.973 --> 00:50:19.960
JANET RANKIN: It's very easy.

00:50:19.960 --> 00:50:21.916
I give them a crystal
structure and I say

00:50:21.916 --> 00:50:23.665
calculate the maximum
size of the ion that

00:50:23.665 --> 00:50:25.270
can fit in the space.

00:50:25.270 --> 00:50:30.270
So I have figured out how, the
measurement is easy, it's cake.

00:50:30.270 --> 00:50:34.240
It's totally straightforward.

00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:36.960
Now I haven't told them, OK, I'm
going to give you this crystal

00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:38.376
structure and I'm
going to ask you

00:50:38.376 --> 00:50:44.250
this spacing, this ion size.

00:50:44.250 --> 00:50:46.552
I haven't given it
away, but I have told

00:50:46.552 --> 00:50:47.760
them what's expected of them.

00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:55.870
And my colleague wrote
these for VSEPR theory.

00:50:55.870 --> 00:50:59.360
It's the same topic,
and it's different.

00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:01.040
Identify the common
geometric shapes

00:51:01.040 --> 00:51:02.630
found in simple molecules.

00:51:02.630 --> 00:51:05.360
Explain the assumptions
of this theory.

00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:08.960
Apply the theory to
predict 3D structures.

00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:12.320
Compare and contrast the
geometry of a certain molecule

00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:15.920
as predicted by two
different theories.

00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:19.380
Evaluate the accuracy
of each theory

00:51:19.380 --> 00:51:21.290
for a particular
set of compounds,

00:51:21.290 --> 00:51:23.550
and then create some
recommendations.

00:51:23.550 --> 00:51:27.590
So it's the same
topic, but you decide

00:51:27.590 --> 00:51:31.220
what it is that students
should be able to do.

00:51:31.220 --> 00:51:32.840
OK?

00:51:32.840 --> 00:51:38.210
So I have some, just a
little exercise for us.

00:51:38.210 --> 00:51:41.162
So they should be specific,
measurable, realistic.

00:51:41.162 --> 00:51:43.370
I'm going to put them up
here and we're going to say,

00:51:43.370 --> 00:51:46.890
you're going to tell me
what's wrong with them.

00:51:46.890 --> 00:51:51.890
So number one, t-tests are
like a statistical analysis.

00:51:51.890 --> 00:51:55.940
So is anybody a
t-test kind of person?

00:51:55.940 --> 00:51:58.400
We can skip that one.

00:51:58.400 --> 00:52:00.320
How about gaining
appreciation for the use

00:52:00.320 --> 00:52:02.930
of linearization techniques?

00:52:02.930 --> 00:52:05.491
What's wrong with it?

00:52:05.491 --> 00:52:08.330
AUDIENCE: It's not specific.

00:52:08.330 --> 00:52:10.524
JANET RANKIN: It's not specific.

00:52:10.524 --> 00:52:12.112
AUDIENCE: It's not measurable.

00:52:12.112 --> 00:52:14.510
JANET RANKIN: It's totally
not measurable, exactly.

00:52:14.510 --> 00:52:18.900
I mean, how do I know
that you appreciate it?

00:52:18.900 --> 00:52:21.250
Don't do it.

00:52:21.250 --> 00:52:21.750
All right.

00:52:21.750 --> 00:52:23.520
Great.

00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:26.850
Have an intuition for the most
effective method of integration

00:52:26.850 --> 00:52:28.770
for a given problem.

00:52:28.770 --> 00:52:30.770
AUDIENCE: It's vague.

00:52:30.770 --> 00:52:33.996
It's not measurable.

00:52:33.996 --> 00:52:36.720
JANET RANKIN: So I've
heard it's not specific,

00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:39.340
it's not measurable,
and it's not vague,

00:52:39.340 --> 00:52:40.650
I mean, and it's vague.

00:52:40.650 --> 00:52:46.320
So right, so have an intuition,
I cannot measure that.

00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:50.350
I have not figured out a
way to measure intuition.

00:52:50.350 --> 00:52:55.290
I can tell whether
you can do it, right,

00:52:55.290 --> 00:53:00.060
but I can't tell you whether
you have an intuition for it.

00:53:00.060 --> 00:53:01.860
Well, how would you rewrite it?

00:53:01.860 --> 00:53:03.317
Actually, how would
you rewrite 2?

00:53:06.796 --> 00:53:14.081
AUDIENCE: Use [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:14.081 --> 00:53:18.430
JANET RANKIN: So it could
be use the techniques.

00:53:18.430 --> 00:53:19.542
Another suggestion?

00:53:19.542 --> 00:53:22.175
AUDIENCE: Make something using
the evaluation techniques.

00:53:22.175 --> 00:53:23.790
JANET RANKIN:
Calculate something.

00:53:23.790 --> 00:53:27.570
Make a first pass estimate
using a particular linearization

00:53:27.570 --> 00:53:28.418
technique.

00:53:28.418 --> 00:53:30.626
AUDIENCE: Describe when you
would use a linearization

00:53:30.626 --> 00:53:31.092
technique.

00:53:31.092 --> 00:53:32.633
JANET RANKIN: Describe
when you would

00:53:32.633 --> 00:53:36.300
use it, describe why you would
use it, all of those things.

00:53:36.300 --> 00:53:41.706
AUDIENCE: List those
areas where [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:41.706 --> 00:53:46.680
JANET RANKIN: List the areas
where it's useful, yes.

00:53:46.680 --> 00:53:47.330
Great.

00:53:47.330 --> 00:53:47.830
All right.

00:53:47.830 --> 00:53:49.770
For number 3, the
gain an intuition,

00:53:49.770 --> 00:53:51.780
we decided it's vague,
it's not measurable.

00:53:54.540 --> 00:53:55.770
So how would you rewrite it?

00:54:03.658 --> 00:54:05.630
AUDIENCE: Compare.

00:54:05.630 --> 00:54:11.570
Compare the areas integration
technique [INAUDIBLE]

00:54:11.570 --> 00:54:14.195
Solve a particular problem using
different kind of [INAUDIBLE].

00:54:14.195 --> 00:54:14.990
JANET RANKIN: OK.

00:54:14.990 --> 00:54:20.660
So solve a problem, and
then we need a little more.

00:54:20.660 --> 00:54:21.635
Did you have something?

00:54:21.635 --> 00:54:24.252
AUDIENCE: Identify the
most effective method of--

00:54:30.060 --> 00:54:32.060
JANET RANKIN: Let's hear
what Rachel had to say.

00:54:32.060 --> 00:54:32.559
Rachel.

00:54:32.559 --> 00:54:33.326
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:54:33.326 --> 00:54:37.977
Learn how to identify
the simplest [INAUDIBLE].

00:54:37.977 --> 00:54:38.810
JANET RANKIN: Right.

00:54:38.810 --> 00:54:41.570
So you probably don't
want to say learn how.

00:54:41.570 --> 00:54:44.230
You would say be
able to identify.

00:54:44.230 --> 00:54:44.800
Right?

00:54:44.800 --> 00:54:45.300
Gordon.

00:54:45.300 --> 00:54:55.467
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:54:55.467 --> 00:54:56.300
JANET RANKIN: Right.

00:54:56.300 --> 00:55:01.560
I mean, you could
just say integrate--

00:55:01.560 --> 00:55:02.910
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:55:02.910 --> 00:55:06.120
JANET RANKIN: Integrate
a problem using whatever.

00:55:06.120 --> 00:55:13.280
Select a technique to integrate
a particular equation.

00:55:16.860 --> 00:55:20.490
And again, those things end
up being more measurable.

00:55:20.490 --> 00:55:24.330
So 4, provide problem
solving tools and strategies.

00:55:24.330 --> 00:55:25.483
What's wrong with that one?

00:55:25.483 --> 00:55:26.765
AUDIENCE: It's too wide.

00:55:26.765 --> 00:55:27.956
JANET RANKIN: It's too wide.

00:55:27.956 --> 00:55:29.856
AUDIENCE: It's
instructor centered.

00:55:29.856 --> 00:55:32.760
JANET RANKIN: It's
instructor centered.

00:55:32.760 --> 00:55:33.376
What else?

00:55:33.376 --> 00:55:36.372
AUDIENCE: But it's measurable.

00:55:36.372 --> 00:55:38.580
JANET RANKIN: Well, I can
measure that I provided it.

00:55:38.580 --> 00:55:41.690
Here, I provided
these handouts, right?

00:55:41.690 --> 00:55:42.390
OK.

00:55:42.390 --> 00:55:43.590
Check.

00:55:43.590 --> 00:55:44.990
It happened.

00:55:44.990 --> 00:55:47.040
Whether or not you could
do anything with them,

00:55:47.040 --> 00:55:50.199
I don't know at
this point, right?

00:55:50.199 --> 00:55:50.990
That's the problem.

00:55:50.990 --> 00:55:53.833
AUDIENCE: It doesn't tell
us what kind of problem

00:55:53.833 --> 00:55:55.920
and what kind of tools
we're going to use.

00:55:55.920 --> 00:55:57.795
Just who gets to
choose the strategies.

00:55:57.795 --> 00:55:59.290
JANET RANKIN: Right.

00:55:59.290 --> 00:55:59.790
Right.

00:55:59.790 --> 00:56:02.520
It's very, very general,
totally not specific.

00:56:02.520 --> 00:56:04.230
So what could we do?

00:56:04.230 --> 00:56:06.750
I mean, we don't know what
this instructor had in mind,

00:56:06.750 --> 00:56:08.700
but what could you do
if this was your class?

00:56:08.700 --> 00:56:09.491
What would you say?

00:56:09.491 --> 00:56:11.685
AUDIENCE: What about
develop instead of provide?

00:56:11.685 --> 00:56:13.890
JANET RANKIN: Develop.

00:56:13.890 --> 00:56:15.930
And again, it would have
to be student centered,

00:56:15.930 --> 00:56:19.470
so the student will be
able to develop problem

00:56:19.470 --> 00:56:21.540
solving tools and strategies.

00:56:21.540 --> 00:56:24.900
That's for x, exactly.

00:56:24.900 --> 00:56:28.620
We want to make it a little
more specific and a little more

00:56:28.620 --> 00:56:32.580
focused, because
that's pretty broad.

00:56:32.580 --> 00:56:34.219
I mean, I have
developed a problem

00:56:34.219 --> 00:56:35.760
solving strategy
that lets me get out

00:56:35.760 --> 00:56:38.190
the door without tripping.

00:56:38.190 --> 00:56:41.340
Does that mean I satisfied
your learning outcomes?

00:56:41.340 --> 00:56:44.070
Probably not.

00:56:44.070 --> 00:56:48.570
So in order to do something--

00:56:48.570 --> 00:56:51.000
Use thermodynamics to
solve engineering problems.

00:56:56.536 --> 00:56:58.675
AUDIENCE: That's not
specific as well.

00:56:58.675 --> 00:57:00.725
JANET RANKIN: It's
not specific at all.

00:57:00.725 --> 00:57:04.209
AUDIENCE: Engineering
is [INAUDIBLE].

00:57:04.209 --> 00:57:05.000
JANET RANKIN: Yeah.

00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:08.240
I mean, it's crazy broad on
a number of fronts, right?

00:57:08.240 --> 00:57:10.280
I mean, it's like
engineering is huge.

00:57:10.280 --> 00:57:12.680
Thermodynamics is
pretty darn big, too.

00:57:12.680 --> 00:57:18.240
So which part of thermodynamics,
which part of engineering?

00:57:21.750 --> 00:57:23.503
Build an SAE race car.

00:57:23.503 --> 00:57:24.489
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:57:24.489 --> 00:57:25.475
JANET RANKIN: What?

00:57:28.433 --> 00:57:29.907
AUDIENCE: It's not realistic.

00:57:29.907 --> 00:57:30.740
JANET RANKIN: Right.

00:57:30.740 --> 00:57:32.660
It's pretty specific.

00:57:32.660 --> 00:57:34.910
Build a functioning
SAE race car.

00:57:34.910 --> 00:57:38.000
It's very specific,
and I can totally

00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:40.292
think of the metric
of how I would measure

00:57:40.292 --> 00:57:41.500
whether students could do it.

00:57:41.500 --> 00:57:43.730
I would just ask them
to build the race car.

00:57:43.730 --> 00:57:45.860
But they're never going
to do it in a class,

00:57:45.860 --> 00:57:48.230
in one class period,
in one course.

00:57:48.230 --> 00:57:51.920
It's unrealistic, exactly.

00:57:51.920 --> 00:57:54.200
Learn to use Laplace
transforms to solve

00:57:54.200 --> 00:57:56.234
differential equations.

00:57:56.234 --> 00:57:59.433
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:57:59.433 --> 00:58:02.010
JANET RANKIN: It's funny.

00:58:02.010 --> 00:58:04.900
I mean, you can
imagine the instructor

00:58:04.900 --> 00:58:07.530
saying you will
learn to use that.

00:58:07.530 --> 00:58:13.580
But let's go, Katherine, work
your magic with this one.

00:58:16.564 --> 00:58:23.452
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:58:23.452 --> 00:58:24.475
JANET RANKIN: Right.

00:58:24.475 --> 00:58:26.600
You're my go-to person for
when you want to get rid

00:58:26.600 --> 00:58:27.869
of all the extra words.

00:58:27.869 --> 00:58:28.910
I'm going to call on you.

00:58:28.910 --> 00:58:29.410
Right.

00:58:29.410 --> 00:58:31.995
Use Laplace transforms.

00:58:31.995 --> 00:58:32.870
That you can measure.

00:58:32.870 --> 00:58:34.760
You can give them
an equation and see

00:58:34.760 --> 00:58:38.459
if they can use Laplace
transforms to solve it.

00:58:38.459 --> 00:58:40.250
And yes, you might want
to be a little more

00:58:40.250 --> 00:58:42.541
specific about the kinds of
differential equations they

00:58:42.541 --> 00:58:48.415
use, and know how to upper
diagonalize a matrix.

00:58:51.090 --> 00:58:52.207
Katherine.

00:58:52.207 --> 00:58:52.706
AUDIENCE: .

00:58:52.706 --> 00:58:55.600
Upper diagonalize a matrix.

00:58:55.600 --> 00:58:58.300
JANET RANKIN: Upper
diagonalize a matrix.

00:58:58.300 --> 00:58:59.770
That's all you
have to say, right?

00:58:59.770 --> 00:59:02.620
Forget the extra words.

00:59:02.620 --> 00:59:06.610
And that is really, I have just
written the assessment question

00:59:06.610 --> 00:59:07.510
for that.

00:59:07.510 --> 00:59:10.060
I know it's totally measurable.

00:59:10.060 --> 00:59:13.780
I give you a matrix and I ask
you to upper diagonalize it.

00:59:13.780 --> 00:59:16.330
I haven't given it away.

00:59:16.330 --> 00:59:19.860
I haven't told you you will
upper diagonalize this matrix,

00:59:19.860 --> 00:59:20.560
right?

00:59:20.560 --> 00:59:22.450
Memorize these
equations that you're

00:59:22.450 --> 00:59:25.480
going to need to write down in
order to upper diagonalize it.

00:59:25.480 --> 00:59:29.440
But I have told you that
that's what's expected of you.

00:59:29.440 --> 00:59:31.238
AUDIENCE: I have
a comment on it.

00:59:31.238 --> 00:59:33.733
It's pretty useful
when a student

00:59:33.733 --> 00:59:36.730
is trying to evaluate
the use of the class.

00:59:36.730 --> 00:59:41.226
For example, the career
fair tomorrow [INAUDIBLE].

00:59:41.226 --> 00:59:43.218
There's a million
[INAUDIBLE] to get jobs.

00:59:43.218 --> 00:59:45.210
OK, how are they
going to evaluate me?

00:59:45.210 --> 00:59:46.635
And if you could
come in and say,

00:59:46.635 --> 00:59:48.297
this happened and
this is what we

00:59:48.297 --> 00:59:51.560
did, as opposed to
having, or have them

00:59:51.560 --> 00:59:53.269
evaluate me on some
random knowledge.

00:59:53.269 --> 00:59:55.060
And then I don't know
that I could respond,

00:59:55.060 --> 00:59:58.880
but I do know stuff.

00:59:58.880 --> 01:00:02.526
So this is really helpful
in kind of a broader sense.

01:00:02.526 --> 01:00:03.801
JANET RANKIN: Right.

01:00:03.801 --> 01:00:04.300
Great.

01:00:04.300 --> 01:00:04.900
No, I'm glad.

01:00:04.900 --> 01:00:06.530
And I think it's so true.

01:00:06.530 --> 01:00:09.880
And people often think,
well, you're giving it away.

01:00:09.880 --> 01:00:11.710
But you're not
giving anything away.

01:00:11.710 --> 01:00:14.020
You're just telling
them the expectations.

01:00:14.020 --> 01:00:15.880
You're not giving
them the problems,

01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:20.350
you're not teaching to the test,
but you're just telling them

01:00:20.350 --> 01:00:26.290
what they're going to be able
to do at the kind of high level,

01:00:26.290 --> 01:00:28.816
or medium level.

01:00:28.816 --> 01:00:30.940
You're telling what they're
going to be able to do.

01:00:30.940 --> 01:00:33.310
I will say-- so ABET,
the Accreditation Board

01:00:33.310 --> 01:00:35.050
for Engineering Teaching--

01:00:35.050 --> 01:00:38.170
every accredited engineering
program has to list,

01:00:38.170 --> 01:00:40.352
they have A through K outcomes.

01:00:40.352 --> 01:00:41.560
And if you look it up, ABET--

01:00:44.230 --> 01:00:48.010
and I'm sure you see
us as accredited--

01:00:48.010 --> 01:00:54.870
if you look up,
they have to, they

01:00:54.870 --> 01:00:57.060
used to do a lot
more bean counting.

01:00:57.060 --> 01:00:59.100
But what they would
do is the outcomes

01:00:59.100 --> 01:01:04.340
would be critical thinking
and problem solving skills,

01:01:04.340 --> 01:01:06.420
and they were a
little bit broad.

01:01:06.420 --> 01:01:08.910
But every department
that got accredited

01:01:08.910 --> 01:01:14.130
had to show how various courses
contributed to the outcomes.

01:01:14.130 --> 01:01:19.350
So somewhere in your department
should be a pretty detailed

01:01:19.350 --> 01:01:22.770
list of how 6 double
00 whatever, did this.

01:01:22.770 --> 01:01:23.980
Or 6 yada, yada--

01:01:23.980 --> 01:01:25.705
I know your grad
students-- but did this.

01:01:25.705 --> 01:01:27.330
The problem is they
don't have to do it

01:01:27.330 --> 01:01:28.440
for grad student courses.

01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:32.430
But it might be helpful if you
looked at that, because I would

01:01:32.430 --> 01:01:34.770
imagine that sometimes
the recruiters would

01:01:34.770 --> 01:01:38.550
be looking at that information,
so that might be a commonality.

01:01:38.550 --> 01:01:42.240
But every program in the US
that's accredited has to have,

01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:46.270
show at least how they've
addressed those outcomes.

01:01:46.270 --> 01:01:48.441
So you might want to
take a look at that.

01:01:48.441 --> 01:01:50.190
But yeah, if it was a
little more explicit

01:01:50.190 --> 01:01:51.437
it would certainly be better.

01:01:51.437 --> 01:01:52.520
And I'm glad it's helpful.

01:01:55.290 --> 01:01:57.240
So I think we can
see, you can start

01:01:57.240 --> 01:02:00.150
to see how there are better
and worse learning outcomes,

01:02:00.150 --> 01:02:03.840
that if they're not measurable
they're not so useful.

01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:06.580
If they are measurable,
they're quite useful.

01:02:06.580 --> 01:02:12.620
So now what I'd like to do
is revisit the worksheet.

01:02:12.620 --> 01:02:16.470
And what we can
do is we're going

01:02:16.470 --> 01:02:20.490
to take about five minutes
where you just sit quietly

01:02:20.490 --> 01:02:25.720
and write out specific
intended learning outcomes.

01:02:25.720 --> 01:02:29.160
So you'll be able to upper
diagonalize a matrix,

01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:33.180
you will be able to
use Laplace transforms

01:02:33.180 --> 01:02:35.790
to solve this type of
differential equation,

01:02:35.790 --> 01:02:39.450
whatever you've
written in this column.

01:02:39.450 --> 01:02:41.460
And note that if you
put it in this column,

01:02:41.460 --> 01:02:43.470
let's say you put it
in the apply column,

01:02:43.470 --> 01:02:46.110
then when you write the learning
outcome it's going to be you

01:02:46.110 --> 01:02:51.870
will be able to interpret
data using blah, blah, blah.

01:02:51.870 --> 01:03:01.380
You will be able to model
the vibration, model a car

01:03:01.380 --> 01:03:04.770
suspension system using
linearization techniques.

01:03:04.770 --> 01:03:08.280
They're going to be whatever,
wherever you put it in the box.

01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:09.750
These are some of
the verbs, these

01:03:09.750 --> 01:03:13.295
are the verbs you're going to
use in your learning outcome.

01:03:13.295 --> 01:03:14.170
Does that make sense?

01:03:17.050 --> 01:03:20.740
And I have even more verbs
for you if that's helpful.

01:03:20.740 --> 01:03:22.401
Did I pass those out?

01:03:22.401 --> 01:03:23.275
You got those, right?

01:03:23.275 --> 01:03:23.980
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:03:23.980 --> 01:03:25.480
JANET RANKIN: So
there's more verbs.

01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:26.950
It's the same thing.

01:03:26.950 --> 01:03:28.960
I mean, it's consistent.

01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:31.000
So take five minutes by
yourself and do that.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.220
And then you're going
to get into pairs

01:03:33.220 --> 01:03:35.380
and you're going to discuss.

01:03:35.380 --> 01:03:38.320
You're going to trade worksheets
and give each other feedback.

01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:38.980
All right?

01:03:38.980 --> 01:03:44.310
So five minutes of quiet
and then we'll pair up.

01:04:03.540 --> 01:04:06.655
So if you can pair up,
you don't necessarily

01:04:06.655 --> 01:04:09.030
have to pair up with people
that are sitting next to you.

01:04:09.030 --> 01:04:12.060
You might want to get a
different perspective,

01:04:12.060 --> 01:04:13.785
so feel free to get
up and move around.

01:04:13.785 --> 01:04:16.780
You can talk to somebody
that wasn't in your group.

01:04:16.780 --> 01:04:19.330
So maybe if you go back
and talk with Alex, maybe.

01:04:19.330 --> 01:04:20.890
We need one group of three.

01:04:20.890 --> 01:04:22.810
Oh, are you a group of three?

01:04:22.810 --> 01:04:28.740
So now just trade sheets
of paper with your partner,

01:04:28.740 --> 01:04:33.670
or if you're a threesome you
can figure out how to do it.

01:04:33.670 --> 01:04:38.010
And then review the learning
outcomes critically.

01:04:38.010 --> 01:04:40.710
Guys, just one sec.

01:04:40.710 --> 01:04:43.530
So just review your partner's
learning outcomes critically.

01:04:43.530 --> 01:04:45.570
Make sure that they're
measurable, realistic,

01:04:45.570 --> 01:04:46.650
and specific.

01:04:46.650 --> 01:04:48.210
If your partner
has used the word

01:04:48.210 --> 01:04:50.910
understand, help him or
her work through that

01:04:50.910 --> 01:04:53.340
to get a better word.

01:04:53.340 --> 01:04:56.820
So you're going to be
a critical friend here.

01:04:56.820 --> 01:04:59.730
And then you guys can
discuss how to improve it.

01:04:59.730 --> 01:05:02.640
And then I'm going to pass
around some flip chart paper

01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:05.880
and each one of you
will write, maybe

01:05:05.880 --> 01:05:08.310
just write your name at the
top, and write two or three

01:05:08.310 --> 01:05:10.534
learning outcomes on
the flip chart paper.

01:05:10.534 --> 01:05:12.450
And then we can stick
them up around the room,

01:05:12.450 --> 01:05:14.580
and then everybody can
see everybody else's,

01:05:14.580 --> 01:05:16.652
all learning outcomes.

01:05:16.652 --> 01:05:21.170
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:05:22.587 --> 01:05:24.045
JANET RANKIN: Was
there a question?

01:05:24.045 --> 01:05:24.753
AUDIENCE: Oh, no.

01:05:24.753 --> 01:05:25.600
I just think--

01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:27.320
AUDIENCE: I think [INAUDIBLE].

01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:35.340
JANET RANKIN: How
are you guys doing?

01:05:35.340 --> 01:05:37.950
Doing OK?

01:05:37.950 --> 01:05:41.868
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:05:58.286 --> 01:06:01.470
JANET RANKIN: So you can use
this zone if you need it.

01:06:05.490 --> 01:06:08.160
As you're looking
at other people's

01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:11.910
learning outcomes,
think about how clear,

01:06:11.910 --> 01:06:14.130
how easy it would
be, or not easy,

01:06:14.130 --> 01:06:17.130
to come up with an exam
question, or a project,

01:06:17.130 --> 01:06:20.070
or an assessment or
measurement of whether

01:06:20.070 --> 01:06:23.580
or not the student reached,
attained the learning outcome.

01:06:23.580 --> 01:06:25.630
You can put them up
here, Ina and Shau.

01:06:34.841 --> 01:06:35.340
OK.

01:06:35.340 --> 01:06:37.810
And as I said, make sure that
you've read everybody else's.

01:06:37.810 --> 01:06:40.750
I'm going to say a
few words about them.

01:06:45.550 --> 01:06:47.500
I think we may have a record.

01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:51.400
This is like the first
time ever that no one

01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:54.850
has used the word
understand, which I think

01:06:54.850 --> 01:06:56.370
you're all to be commended for.

01:07:00.190 --> 01:07:04.900
So David, make sure you
don't write understand.

01:07:04.900 --> 01:07:06.736
You build me up just
to knock me down.

01:07:12.110 --> 01:07:13.597
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:07:13.597 --> 01:07:15.430
JANET RANKIN: You can,
or you don't have to.

01:07:15.430 --> 01:07:16.179
It doesn't matter.

01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:24.260
Does anyone have any comments,
either about the exercise

01:07:24.260 --> 01:07:29.510
itself, or about somebody's
learning outcomes,

01:07:29.510 --> 01:07:30.380
that you see around?

01:07:33.250 --> 01:07:35.260
Again, the
measurement, the thing

01:07:35.260 --> 01:07:37.510
you want to look at when you
look at your own learning

01:07:37.510 --> 01:07:40.640
outcomes and those of others, is
are they specific, measurable,

01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:42.940
and realistic?

01:07:42.940 --> 01:07:46.540
And would you know
if a student achieved

01:07:46.540 --> 01:07:48.500
those learning outcomes?

01:07:48.500 --> 01:07:53.740
So I would say about 90%
of these are very specific,

01:07:53.740 --> 01:07:54.980
which is great.

01:07:54.980 --> 01:07:59.470
I mean, there's some
incredibly specific ones here.

01:07:59.470 --> 01:08:04.060
The more specific, the
easier it is to measure.

01:08:04.060 --> 01:08:04.900
So that's one thing.

01:08:04.900 --> 01:08:06.610
That's a useful thing.

01:08:06.610 --> 01:08:08.950
You want to make sure
you don't get so specific

01:08:08.950 --> 01:08:11.980
that there's only like one
question you could ask.

01:08:11.980 --> 01:08:14.170
So that's the balance.

01:08:14.170 --> 01:08:16.270
Sometimes you can't
tell that unless you're

01:08:16.270 --> 01:08:18.355
in the discipline.

01:08:18.355 --> 01:08:24.040
Do we have other comments about
any of these learning outcomes,

01:08:24.040 --> 01:08:29.279
something you don't
get, something that

01:08:29.279 --> 01:08:30.784
looks particularly interesting?

01:08:33.990 --> 01:08:34.890
Yes, Gordon.

01:08:34.890 --> 01:08:38.355
Perhaps you can sit down
if you're done reading.

01:08:38.355 --> 01:08:42.323
AUDIENCE: I'm looking around
and I'm seeing [INAUDIBLE].

01:08:52.739 --> 01:08:54.723
I don't know how
it's going to be.

01:08:54.723 --> 01:08:56.211
How are we going to test that?

01:08:56.211 --> 01:09:00.740
JANET RANKIN: Well, I guess you
have to come up with a reaction

01:09:00.740 --> 01:09:03.810
that you're confident
they haven't seen before.

01:09:03.810 --> 01:09:08.359
So if you can do that, then
you can ask them to propose

01:09:08.359 --> 01:09:11.560
a mechanism for it, I suppose.

01:09:11.560 --> 01:09:13.370
If the person that
wrote it wants to--

01:09:13.370 --> 01:09:15.578
I know who wrote it-- but
if the person that wrote it

01:09:15.578 --> 01:09:18.600
wants to talk a little bit
about it, that would be great.

01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:19.100
If not--

01:09:19.100 --> 01:09:22.390
AUDIENCE: OK, So a
lot of people are

01:09:22.390 --> 01:09:26.150
going to just try to memorize
each specific outcome.

01:09:26.150 --> 01:09:29.516
But it's easier to just
identify your activity group

01:09:29.516 --> 01:09:31.585
and find patterns within them.

01:09:31.585 --> 01:09:45.445
So if you can try [INAUDIBLE]
They can't just [INAUDIBLE].

01:09:50.890 --> 01:09:52.207
JANET RANKIN: Right.

01:09:52.207 --> 01:09:53.290
And this is a great point.

01:09:53.290 --> 01:09:54.790
I mentioned it to
one of the groups.

01:09:54.790 --> 01:09:59.550
But sometimes we'll say explain
how blah, blah, blah, works.

01:09:59.550 --> 01:10:01.680
And that's a great
thought, that, oh,

01:10:01.680 --> 01:10:04.170
they're going to be able
to explain it, right?

01:10:04.170 --> 01:10:06.390
But many times
they can fall back

01:10:06.390 --> 01:10:09.855
on a memorized
explanation or sort

01:10:09.855 --> 01:10:12.960
of kind of a canned procedure.

01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:16.620
So if you really want them to
be at the level of explain,

01:10:16.620 --> 01:10:19.410
you will have to kind
of make some things up

01:10:19.410 --> 01:10:21.840
to get them out of,
to get them away

01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:24.870
from the ability to just
pull something completely

01:10:24.870 --> 01:10:26.040
from memory.

01:10:26.040 --> 01:10:30.505
So this is an example of
how you might do that.

01:10:34.780 --> 01:10:37.392
Other observations or questions?

01:10:37.392 --> 01:10:41.180
AUDIENCE: I also [INAUDIBLE]
something that all [INAUDIBLE].

01:10:52.680 --> 01:10:56.410
JANET RANKIN: So
perhaps the person

01:10:56.410 --> 01:10:58.191
that wrote it wants
to comment on it.

01:10:58.191 --> 01:10:59.574
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:10:59.574 --> 01:11:00.957
So [INAUDIBLE].

01:11:19.390 --> 01:11:22.220
I think what we have,
just [INAUDIBLE].

01:11:26.550 --> 01:11:27.800
So we write and compile.

01:11:31.380 --> 01:11:37.112
So you write a code and
then you compile it.

01:11:37.112 --> 01:11:37.945
JANET RANKIN: Right.

01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:45.640
And this is a great
example of how

01:11:45.640 --> 01:11:48.040
having people that
aren't in the field

01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:51.580
read them can help clarify
things for your students, who

01:11:51.580 --> 01:11:54.400
are by default not experts.

01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:57.430
So perhaps to an
expert, it totally

01:11:57.430 --> 01:11:59.650
makes sense, of course, code.

01:11:59.650 --> 01:12:02.470
But to somebody that's not an
expert, maybe that's confusing.

01:12:02.470 --> 01:12:06.010
Maybe the use of code
twice was confusing.

01:12:06.010 --> 01:12:08.290
To an expert, it's
totally readable.

01:12:08.290 --> 01:12:09.542
It's totally understandable.

01:12:09.542 --> 01:12:10.750
Perhaps to a novice it isn't.

01:12:10.750 --> 01:12:11.416
You're laughing.

01:12:11.416 --> 01:12:14.140
AUDIENCE: It's funny, because
we're both [INAUDIBLE].

01:12:14.140 --> 01:12:17.957
JANET RANKIN: Yeah,
that was kind of random.

01:12:17.957 --> 01:12:19.540
Well, that's a perfect
example, right?

01:12:19.540 --> 01:12:22.300
It's a perfect example of how
getting maybe other people that

01:12:22.300 --> 01:12:23.830
aren't in your field
to look at them

01:12:23.830 --> 01:12:28.390
can help make them more
accessible to your students.

01:12:28.390 --> 01:12:29.327
OK.

01:12:29.327 --> 01:12:29.910
This is great.

01:12:29.910 --> 01:12:30.890
Oh, Hina.

01:12:30.890 --> 01:12:34.260
AUDIENCE: I had, it's
on a different topic.

01:12:34.260 --> 01:12:36.890
But really, I'm talking
about buzz words

01:12:36.890 --> 01:12:38.270
in learning outcomes.

01:12:38.270 --> 01:12:40.582
I think with engineering,
you're really

01:12:40.582 --> 01:12:43.950
excited about telling people
about real world problems.

01:12:43.950 --> 01:12:46.880
I guess that's the reason why.

01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:50.370
I guess it's more of
an opinion question.

01:12:50.370 --> 01:12:54.290
As you write your learning
outcomes I think in some ways

01:12:54.290 --> 01:12:57.230
it's better to be specific
about the real world problems

01:12:57.230 --> 01:12:58.700
that they're going to attack.

01:12:58.700 --> 01:13:02.130
Because I've seen that on
syllabuses all the time.

01:13:02.130 --> 01:13:04.090
I'm very excited about it.

01:13:04.090 --> 01:13:06.540
I think it's a way to
teach people in your class.

01:13:06.540 --> 01:13:10.460
It's going to help them know
what tools they're getting.

01:13:10.460 --> 01:13:11.460
JANET RANKIN: Right.

01:13:11.460 --> 01:13:13.650
I mean, real world
problems in particular

01:13:13.650 --> 01:13:19.590
really do kind of encapsulate a
whole pile of hopes and dreams.

01:13:19.590 --> 01:13:21.600
So it may help to be a
little more specific.

01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:24.630
You can use it in your
learning outcomes,

01:13:24.630 --> 01:13:27.450
but then maybe describe
it in a little more detail

01:13:27.450 --> 01:13:32.280
in your syllabus, the kinds
of real world problems,

01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:34.170
or why we care about
real world problems.

01:13:34.170 --> 01:13:35.140
They're messy.

01:13:35.140 --> 01:13:36.750
They're ill-defined.

01:13:36.750 --> 01:13:39.310
What about them is so important?

01:13:39.310 --> 01:13:43.530
What about them is so important?

01:13:43.530 --> 01:13:45.420
Try to minimize the buzz words.

01:13:45.420 --> 01:13:47.859
But at some level, they may
not know about something

01:13:47.859 --> 01:13:49.900
until they're completely
through with the course,

01:13:49.900 --> 01:13:51.316
and you may have
to use that word.

01:13:51.316 --> 01:13:53.550
So there's a bit of a balance.

01:13:53.550 --> 01:13:54.990
What I'm going to
do before, I'll

01:13:54.990 --> 01:13:56.880
probably bring all
these back to my office,

01:13:56.880 --> 01:14:00.570
take pictures of them, and
put them up on the wiki

01:14:00.570 --> 01:14:03.810
so you'll have a record of them.

01:14:03.810 --> 01:14:08.230
I wanted to just
as we go out here,

01:14:08.230 --> 01:14:14.050
my point is really
that the hard part

01:14:14.050 --> 01:14:15.910
is these learning outcomes.

01:14:15.910 --> 01:14:17.830
And that once you write
the learning outcomes,

01:14:17.830 --> 01:14:20.110
as we said before,
you kind of know

01:14:20.110 --> 01:14:23.920
how you're going to test
whether students got them,

01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:28.600
and you know what you're going
to do to help them get them.

01:14:28.600 --> 01:14:34.810
The syllabus itself is just
an articulation of that.

01:14:34.810 --> 01:14:36.770
It's a description
of the course,

01:14:36.770 --> 01:14:38.470
an articulation of
the learning outcomes

01:14:38.470 --> 01:14:41.620
stated, like the laundry
example, with the title.

01:14:41.620 --> 01:14:43.810
This is what you're going to do.

01:14:43.810 --> 01:14:46.450
By the end of the class this
is what you'll be able to do.

01:14:46.450 --> 01:14:49.420
It's kind of a promise that
that's what you're going to do.

01:14:49.420 --> 01:14:51.790
It motivates students
to take the class,

01:14:51.790 --> 01:14:56.230
to stay in the class, to
engage with the class.

01:14:56.230 --> 01:14:58.492
It keeps you on track.

01:14:58.492 --> 01:14:59.950
So at the beginning
of the semester

01:14:59.950 --> 01:15:04.120
maybe I'll be very
clear, but four weeks in,

01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:06.820
and you're a little bit fuzzy,
because you've been dealing

01:15:06.820 --> 01:15:08.440
with all sorts of stuff.

01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:10.690
And you kind of
go, what the heck.

01:15:10.690 --> 01:15:12.400
What's this in here for?

01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:15.580
Well, if you've lined everything
up at the beginning using

01:15:15.580 --> 01:15:17.320
your learning outcomes
as the anchor,

01:15:17.320 --> 01:15:19.940
then you don't have
to worry about that.

01:15:19.940 --> 01:15:21.640
You just follow the map.

01:15:21.640 --> 01:15:25.870
So it really, really
helps you and the students

01:15:25.870 --> 01:15:30.370
get through the semester
in a logical way.

01:15:30.370 --> 01:15:33.550
And it tells the
students what they

01:15:33.550 --> 01:15:37.070
can expect of you, what
you can expect of them.

01:15:37.070 --> 01:15:40.870
So it's motivational,
structural,

01:15:40.870 --> 01:15:45.310
and it's evidence, hopefully
of what they did, but certainly

01:15:45.310 --> 01:15:47.330
of what you hope
to do with them.

01:15:50.750 --> 01:15:53.060
So for the post-session
assignment,

01:15:53.060 --> 01:15:55.862
you'll have to write up
more learning outcomes

01:15:55.862 --> 01:15:56.570
from your course.

01:15:56.570 --> 01:16:00.140
You can use these as
the basis for sure.

01:16:00.140 --> 01:16:04.190
Hopefully, that table will help
you as you write more of them.

01:16:04.190 --> 01:16:05.847
And I will go in and
give you feedback.

01:16:05.847 --> 01:16:08.180
I want to make sure that
everybody knows that you should

01:16:08.180 --> 01:16:10.550
read each other's postings.

01:16:10.550 --> 01:16:14.577
So a lot of you had great
examples from the first class

01:16:14.577 --> 01:16:16.160
about how you would
use these learning

01:16:16.160 --> 01:16:20.154
theories in your courses
and how you teach.

01:16:20.154 --> 01:16:21.320
They were fabulous examples.

01:16:21.320 --> 01:16:23.153
Make sure you read those
postings of others.

01:16:23.153 --> 01:16:26.100
That's one reason why it's
up on a wiki and not just

01:16:26.100 --> 01:16:28.640
you handing it in to me.

01:16:28.640 --> 01:16:30.530
So you have the Mud cards.

01:16:30.530 --> 01:16:33.420
Fill them out if you have any
more information that you want.

01:16:33.420 --> 01:16:39.730
And otherwise,
we'll see next week.
