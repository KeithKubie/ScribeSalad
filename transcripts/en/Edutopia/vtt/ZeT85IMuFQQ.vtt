00:00:07.306 --> 00:00:10.406
&gt;&gt;Teacher: All right, if you still
need to record, your books are

00:00:10.406 --> 00:00:12.166
in this little closet
right over here, so--

00:00:12.306 --> 00:00:14.226
&gt;&gt;Narrator: One of the
key ingredients to success

00:00:14.226 --> 00:00:17.736
at YES Prep North Central, is
the caliber of the teachers here.

00:00:18.016 --> 00:00:18.926
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Any questions before I--

00:00:18.926 --> 00:00:20.276
&gt;&gt;Chris: YES was founded by teachers.

00:00:20.276 --> 00:00:23.236
We wanted to create an organization
that was going to be able

00:00:23.236 --> 00:00:25.506
to be a good place
for teachers to work,

00:00:25.616 --> 00:00:28.056
where teachers could have a
voice in how the school was run,

00:00:28.136 --> 00:00:31.146
that it was a place where every
decision was made in the interest

00:00:31.146 --> 00:00:33.216
of what's going to be great
for kids and teachers.

00:00:33.216 --> 00:00:34.246
&gt;&gt;Rachel: Talk about
that with your table.

00:00:34.246 --> 00:00:36.056
What are the problems
that might come up.

00:00:36.056 --> 00:00:39.406
&gt;&gt;Jeremy: We know that teachers
are the single greatest factor

00:00:39.636 --> 00:00:41.816
in the achievement of
a low income students.

00:00:41.816 --> 00:00:43.976
And so if we can go
out there and make sure

00:00:43.976 --> 00:00:46.846
that we find a great teacher
for every single classroom,

00:00:47.086 --> 00:00:48.286
then we will be able to continue

00:00:48.286 --> 00:00:50.336
to send 100 percent of
our kids to college.

00:00:50.416 --> 00:00:52.736
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Like, what
is this poem about?

00:00:52.736 --> 00:00:53.446
Don't worry about--

00:00:53.446 --> 00:00:56.986
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In order to build a
great team, YES Prep developed a list

00:00:56.986 --> 00:00:59.936
of traits that they are looking
for in the teachers they hire.

00:01:00.236 --> 00:01:02.896
&gt;&gt;Mark: We hired an outside
organization to come in and look

00:01:02.896 --> 00:01:05.506
at our teachers and find out,
like, what are the traits

00:01:05.946 --> 00:01:09.916
that really represent our highest
performing teachers, and then we look

00:01:09.916 --> 00:01:12.146
at those traits when we
interview, and we try and make sure

00:01:12.146 --> 00:01:15.046
that thank you people we bring in
have each of those seven traits.

00:01:15.556 --> 00:01:18.446
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The traits
include, rebound time.

00:01:18.646 --> 00:01:22.216
&gt;&gt;Mark: How quickly our teachers,
after a setback, bounce back,

00:01:22.666 --> 00:01:24.176
and are ready to keep going.

00:01:24.216 --> 00:01:25.436
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Energy mode.

00:01:25.796 --> 00:01:28.636
&gt;&gt;Jeremy: Because we have a longer
school day, and a longer school year,

00:01:28.876 --> 00:01:31.726
our teachers are going to have
to sustain energy and passion

00:01:31.726 --> 00:01:33.236
over an entire school year.

00:01:33.446 --> 00:01:34.436
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Get down,
get down, get down.

00:01:34.436 --> 00:01:35.656
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Taking charge.

00:01:36.156 --> 00:01:38.716
&gt;&gt;Mark: We're looking
for teachers as leaders.

00:01:38.986 --> 00:01:42.686
They don't see themselves as just
teachers, they're people who see

00:01:42.686 --> 00:01:45.396
that classroom as an
opportunity to lead.

00:01:45.666 --> 00:01:46.446
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Agreement.

00:01:46.446 --> 00:01:49.056
&gt;&gt;Jeremy: Well, we're not looking
for somebody who just wants

00:01:49.056 --> 00:01:51.106
to shut their door
and teach those kids,

00:01:51.106 --> 00:01:54.206
we're looking for somebody who's
going to go across the hallway

00:01:54.206 --> 00:01:58.086
or across the grade level, to have
conversations with other teachers.

00:01:58.086 --> 00:01:59.626
&gt;&gt;Teacher: And I'm sure we
can probably collaborate

00:01:59.626 --> 00:02:01.466
and share challenges on this, too.

00:02:01.466 --> 00:02:02.506
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Perfectionism.

00:02:02.586 --> 00:02:03.856
&gt;&gt;Teacher: I think
it's really important

00:02:03.856 --> 00:02:07.576
that they aren't ever
satisfied with 99.9 percent.

00:02:07.796 --> 00:02:10.056
We're looking for the
100 percent every day.

00:02:10.696 --> 00:02:12.396
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The other
traits are, drive,

00:02:12.466 --> 00:02:16.036
which entails the continual setting
and achievement of personal goals,

00:02:16.446 --> 00:02:21.046
and reserve, which YES calls the
ability to share their opinions.

00:02:21.046 --> 00:02:23.606
&gt;&gt;Teacher: I liked when we
had time to work on things.

00:02:24.126 --> 00:02:26.696
&gt;&gt;Teacher: And again,
this is just proposed.

00:02:27.276 --> 00:02:29.686
No decisions have been made,
but it's the time of the year

00:02:29.686 --> 00:02:31.736
to do these things, because we
have to finalize the schedule,

00:02:31.736 --> 00:02:33.396
actually within the
next couple of weeks.

00:02:33.876 --> 00:02:37.216
&gt;&gt;Narrator: To balance the longer
work days and high expectations,

00:02:37.486 --> 00:02:39.976
the administration built
a support structure

00:02:39.976 --> 00:02:43.006
to ensure the teachers have
the resources they need.

00:02:43.636 --> 00:02:46.666
&gt;&gt;Craig: Burn out is something we
have to deal with, but we work hard

00:02:46.666 --> 00:02:50.836
as administrators to find ways
to relieve teachers and try

00:02:50.836 --> 00:02:53.946
and provide some balance in a
job that's inherently unbalanced.

00:02:53.946 --> 00:02:55.946
&gt;&gt;Philip: Maybe if we could just
take five minutes on our own,

00:02:55.946 --> 00:02:57.546
and just write some thoughts
on the pros and cons.

00:02:58.056 --> 00:03:01.096
&gt;&gt;Narrator: YES Prep's support
system includes a full time Dean

00:03:01.096 --> 00:03:04.236
of Instruction, who directs
professional development.

00:03:04.236 --> 00:03:05.636
&gt;&gt;Teacher: I want you to
read the first paragraph.

00:03:05.636 --> 00:03:08.736
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Michelle LaFlure,
observes a classroom instruction,

00:03:08.736 --> 00:03:12.026
and gives feedback to veterans
and new teachers alike.

00:03:12.246 --> 00:03:14.476
&gt;&gt;Michelle: We have a pretty
intensive rubric that we use,

00:03:14.516 --> 00:03:19.616
so I go into every classroom
approximately five times a year.

00:03:19.616 --> 00:03:23.056
The majority of my time is spent
observing and debriefing with them.

00:03:23.056 --> 00:03:24.886
&gt;&gt;And after we talk
about high expectations

00:03:24.886 --> 00:03:26.196
for this particular lesson,

00:03:26.196 --> 00:03:28.696
then we'll go into student
centered classroom, which is--

00:03:28.936 --> 00:03:31.506
&gt;&gt;We want to give them a
comprehensive evaluation,

00:03:31.706 --> 00:03:35.876
not just one that's solely based
on instruction, and so we look

00:03:35.876 --> 00:03:39.766
at instruction, management,
assessments, planning--

00:03:39.966 --> 00:03:43.096
&gt;&gt;There's some key takeaways so that
you can write down key takeaways

00:03:43.096 --> 00:03:46.796
from this meeting, and then we'll
establish some action steps also.

00:03:47.046 --> 00:03:50.596
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Teachers also have
nearly two hours each day for team

00:03:50.596 --> 00:03:54.286
and grade level planning meetings
during the extended school day.

00:03:54.286 --> 00:03:55.596
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Tuesday, you are doing,

00:03:55.596 --> 00:03:58.366
What is Poetry, and
the Go Inside poem.

00:03:59.306 --> 00:04:01.346
&gt;&gt;Michelle: Having that
common planning time,

00:04:01.646 --> 00:04:06.706
just enhances the collaboration among
the team, but also, great minds,

00:04:06.706 --> 00:04:10.046
when they work together, are
able to accomplish so much more

00:04:10.046 --> 00:04:12.516
than just an isolated
individual, working on something.

00:04:12.516 --> 00:04:15.756
&gt;&gt;Katie: I know we talked about you
maybe writing poems for the lesson.

00:04:16.286 --> 00:04:17.466
Do you still want to do some of that?

00:04:17.666 --> 00:04:19.176
&gt;&gt;With the team teaching
relationship,

00:04:19.176 --> 00:04:21.376
we're looking for possible
points of integration,

00:04:21.376 --> 00:04:22.796
but I also have planning time

00:04:22.796 --> 00:04:24.346
with the other seventh
grade English teacher,

00:04:24.856 --> 00:04:26.116
so we're teaching the same thing.

00:04:26.156 --> 00:04:28.976
So at that point, we're
dividing up relationships,

00:04:28.976 --> 00:04:32.106
and we can literally do double the
work, because we split up things

00:04:32.106 --> 00:04:35.536
like lesson plans, making
projects, organizing exhibition.

00:04:36.006 --> 00:04:38.176
&gt;&gt;Narrator: There's no
top down management here.

00:04:38.596 --> 00:04:42.336
All YES Prep teachers have a
voice in setting school policies,

00:04:42.496 --> 00:04:45.466
which results in a vibrant
energetic democracy.

00:04:45.466 --> 00:04:48.556
&gt;&gt;Teacher: It would be great if
we actually voted as a staff,

00:04:48.556 --> 00:04:52.456
of the things that we want to learn
and then make those into goals.

00:04:52.706 --> 00:04:55.336
&gt;&gt;Jeremy: You know, it's challenging
for me, sometimes, as a leader,

00:04:55.336 --> 00:04:59.046
because your tendency is to want
to keep control of everything.

00:04:59.336 --> 00:05:02.056
And the more that I sort of
keep the authority to myself,

00:05:02.056 --> 00:05:05.546
and keep the decision making to
myself, the more likely our school is

00:05:05.546 --> 00:05:10.956
to become stagnant, and just
become basically a microcosm of me,

00:05:11.226 --> 00:05:12.576
and that's the last
thing I would want.

00:05:12.576 --> 00:05:15.046
And so I intentionally hire
people who are different from me,

00:05:15.166 --> 00:05:19.276
I intentionally look for ways to
have people in my school who push me.

00:05:19.366 --> 00:05:22.056
&gt;&gt;Teacher: That way, by the
end of the year, every teacher,

00:05:22.266 --> 00:05:25.866
at least once, got to go to
exactly what they needed to.

00:05:26.006 --> 00:05:28.946
&gt;&gt;Jeremy: We also have a weekly
early dismissal on Wednesdays,

00:05:28.946 --> 00:05:31.076
where teachers gather to do
professional development,

00:05:31.376 --> 00:05:34.826
and sometimes we'll do something
fun, like have a staff game,

00:05:34.826 --> 00:05:37.736
or a staff picnic, or a staff
barbecue, just something

00:05:37.856 --> 00:05:41.706
to continually draw on our strength
of relationships with each other.

00:05:42.101 --> 00:05:44.101
&gt;&gt;All: [cheers, applause]

00:05:44.496 --> 00:05:47.546
&gt;&gt;Michelle: I'm going to have
you guys reflect a little bit

00:05:47.546 --> 00:05:50.946
individually about what worked
and what didn't work so well.

00:05:51.196 --> 00:05:54.446
And then we'll have a discussion,
to kind of come away with some ideas

00:05:54.446 --> 00:05:55.716
for things that can change for next--

00:05:55.716 --> 00:05:58.186
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The structured
teamwork and support at YES Prep,

00:05:58.186 --> 00:06:01.046
enhances camaraderie
and mutual respect.

00:06:01.136 --> 00:06:03.386
&gt;&gt;Michelle: So if you have any
ideas, you can e-mail Mark.

00:06:03.386 --> 00:06:05.846
&gt;&gt;Katie: I love the
freedom that I'm given here.

00:06:05.846 --> 00:06:08.646
I love the fact that
the sky's the limit.

00:06:08.646 --> 00:06:12.656
I mean, there's literally no end
to what I can accomplish here.

00:06:12.816 --> 00:06:15.096
I feel like there's
leadership opportunities for me,

00:06:15.096 --> 00:06:18.366
I feel like there is support,
there's people I love,

00:06:18.366 --> 00:06:20.586
and so I'm exhausted all the time.

00:06:20.636 --> 00:06:22.386
I mean, it's a really,
really hard job,

00:06:22.766 --> 00:06:24.736
but I am always driven to do more.

00:06:24.836 --> 00:06:28.636
&gt;&gt;Craig: And a quarter of
a clap for Peck, one-two--

00:06:28.886 --> 00:06:31.816
&gt;&gt;Narrator: At the end of each
long week, the staff gets together

00:06:31.816 --> 00:06:35.656
for shout outs, to acknowledge
their hard work and collaborations

00:06:35.896 --> 00:06:37.456
that go beyond the call of duty.

00:06:37.706 --> 00:06:39.516
&gt;&gt;Teacher: So Holly was
planning portfolios,

00:06:39.516 --> 00:06:41.526
getting stuff ready
for the Spring trip--

00:06:41.596 --> 00:06:43.336
&gt;&gt;Craig: At first,
the staff was like,

00:06:43.496 --> 00:06:45.436
why are we doing this,
this is kind of strange.

00:06:45.926 --> 00:06:48.286
But for me, it is one of
the highlights of the week.

00:06:48.286 --> 00:06:51.436
It is fun on Fridays to get
together after a grueling week,

00:06:51.546 --> 00:06:55.576
which it is here at YES,
to shout each other out.

00:06:55.746 --> 00:06:58.886
&gt;&gt;Teacher: She's been able to
juggle a thousand different things.

00:06:58.886 --> 00:07:00.786
&gt;&gt;Craig: And they range
anywhere from, you know,

00:07:00.786 --> 00:07:02.806
I want to thank so-and-so,
for covering my class

00:07:02.806 --> 00:07:05.616
when I had a Parent come in,
to, I want to thank so-and-so

00:07:05.616 --> 00:07:08.516
for bringing me a cup of coffee
this morning, I really needed it.

00:07:08.886 --> 00:07:11.296
&gt;&gt;Craig: Two claps and a
train for Holly, one-two.

00:07:12.396 --> 00:07:14.506
&gt;&gt;All: [clapping] Choo-choo,
come on, ride it.

00:07:14.506 --> 00:07:16.196
&gt;&gt;Teacher: The students
now have adopted it.

00:07:16.196 --> 00:07:18.326
Every grade level does
the exact same thing,

00:07:18.676 --> 00:07:20.486
and not only the North
Central Campus,

00:07:20.486 --> 00:07:23.016
but some of the other YES
schools have adopted this idea

00:07:23.016 --> 00:07:24.946
of the two claps for.

00:07:25.066 --> 00:07:26.896
&gt;&gt;Teacher: And I just think that's
true of pretty much everyone

00:07:26.896 --> 00:07:29.886
in this room, that, every
time I see Craig, I'm uplifted

00:07:29.976 --> 00:07:33.756
and excited, and thank you for that.

00:07:34.016 --> 00:07:38.676
&gt;&gt;Craig: Two claps and a bow for me.

00:07:38.706 --> 00:07:40.036
One-two [clapping].
