00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:04.240
 We are given the number 35, which is 3 decades, 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:06.459
 because we have 3 in the order of the decimal, 

00:00:06.459 --> 00:00:09.130
 that is, we have 3 tens 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:11.597
 and we also have 5 in the order of units. 

00:00:11.597 --> 00:00:14.400
 Here is the order of the units. 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.814
 I will color the units in the same color - purple. 

00:00:16.814 --> 00:00:18.370
 This is the order of the units. 

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:21.272
 We see that the number of units is 5, 

00:00:21.272 --> 00:00:22.828
 i.e. 5 units. 

00:00:22.828 --> 00:00:24.961
 Therefore, 35 is the same as 

00:00:24.961 --> 00:00:27.651
 3 tenths and 5 units. 

00:00:27.651 --> 00:00:30.119
 3 tenths and 5 units. 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.183
 In this video we'll get the number 8 out of 35 

00:00:33.183 --> 00:00:34.883
 and I encourage you to stop the video 

00:00:34.883 --> 00:00:37.755
 try to find out how much it is 35 minus 8. 

00:00:37.755 --> 00:00:40.126
 Let's now think together. 

00:00:40.126 --> 00:00:44.375
 We have 5 units and we want to get 8 units out of them. 

00:00:44.375 --> 00:00:47.115
 We do not know how to draw 8, if we only have 5. 

00:00:47.115 --> 00:00:49.734
 We can get 5, but the units will end. 

00:00:49.734 --> 00:00:51.527
 So how do we get 8? 

00:00:51.527 --> 00:00:53.617
 That is why transporting us is very useful, 

00:00:53.617 --> 00:00:56.425
 because the squares are not only 5. 

00:00:56.426 --> 00:00:58.864
 Actually, we have 35 squares. 

00:00:58.864 --> 00:01:00.675
 We have 3 groups of 10 squares 

00:01:00.675 --> 00:01:02.765
 and another 5 squares. 

00:01:02.765 --> 00:01:05.574
 What if we take one of these groups at 10, 

00:01:05.574 --> 00:01:07.384
 here, here, 

00:01:07.385 --> 00:01:09.916
 and we bring it here to the units? 

00:01:09.916 --> 00:01:12.610
 Let's take this group here, 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.257
 if we take this group of 10 squares 

00:01:15.257 --> 00:01:18.136
 and instead of displaying it in the tenths, 

00:01:18.136 --> 00:01:20.220
 put it to the units. 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.509
 Transfer her here 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.560
 in units, it will be ..., 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.681
 and so one tenth will be the same as 10 units, 

00:01:26.681 --> 00:01:30.744
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 

00:01:30.744 --> 00:01:35.160
 7, 8, 9 and 10. 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.920
 What happened now? 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.801
 I took one of those ten, 

00:01:38.801 --> 00:01:41.680
 so now I have only 2 tens, 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.745
 I took these 10 and transferred them to the units. 

00:01:44.745 --> 00:01:46.718
 So I have the initial 5 units 

00:01:46.718 --> 00:01:48.692
 and I have 10 more new ones, 

00:01:48.692 --> 00:01:50.457
 which I took from the order of the dozen. 

00:01:50.457 --> 00:01:52.686
 Therefore, 5 plus 10 equals 15. 

00:01:52.686 --> 00:01:57.167
 So now I have 15 units. 

00:01:57.167 --> 00:01:59.837
 And now I can get 8. 

00:01:59.837 --> 00:02:02.647
 So if I get 8 now, 

00:02:02.647 --> 00:02:05.380
 I will scratch 1, 2, 3, 4 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.900
 5, 6, 7, 8 to make it clear. 

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:10.773
 I scratch 8. 

00:02:10.773 --> 00:02:12.537
 How long will I stay? 

00:02:12.538 --> 00:02:15.580
 I'll have two decades left, 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.296
 there will be 2 tens 

00:02:18.296 --> 00:02:19.983
 and how many units? 

00:02:19.984 --> 00:02:24.589
 I have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 units. 

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:27.609
 7 units here. 

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:29.366
 But how to calculate this 

00:02:29.366 --> 00:02:31.243
 without drawing all these squares? 

00:02:31.243 --> 00:02:33.210
 If you say, "Okay, I have 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.831
 3 tens and 5 units "- that's where we started. 

00:02:35.831 --> 00:02:37.952
 But I took 1 of these tenes, 

00:02:37.953 --> 00:02:41.442
 I took 1 of these tenes and left only 2 now, 

00:02:41.442 --> 00:02:45.151
 I took that tenth and carried it to the units, 

00:02:45.151 --> 00:02:46.990
 that is, I presented it as 10 units. 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.145
 So 5 units plus the other 10 units 

00:02:49.145 --> 00:02:51.420
 gives us 15 units. 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:52.952
 15 units. 

00:02:52.953 --> 00:02:57.132
 You can say, "15 units minus 8 units is equal to 7 units." 

00:02:57.132 --> 00:03:00.383
 We see here 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 

00:03:00.383 --> 00:03:03.308
 that is, after subtraction we have 7 units 

00:03:03.308 --> 00:03:06.396
 and two more decades remaining in the order of the dozen. 

00:03:06.396 --> 00:03:10.780
 We received 2 tens and 7 units. 27.
