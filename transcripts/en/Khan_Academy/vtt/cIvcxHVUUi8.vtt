00:00:00.173 --> 00:00:01.837
- [Voiceover] Hi everyone, so
in the last couple of videos

00:00:01.837 --> 00:00:04.149
I was talking about
various functions of money,

00:00:04.149 --> 00:00:05.722
and people usually list at least three

00:00:05.722 --> 00:00:07.235
different functions that it serves.

00:00:07.235 --> 00:00:08.980
The first is a medium of exchange,

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:10.910
it's what we use to trade for goods.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:12.381
The second is that it's a store of value,

00:00:12.381 --> 00:00:15.199
if you keep your money around
it'll retain its value.

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:16.974
And the third is that
it's a unit of value,

00:00:16.974 --> 00:00:19.493
we usually think of things
in, you know, dollar terms,

00:00:19.493 --> 00:00:21.820
or euro or peso or yen terms.

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.586
And some texts will actually add a fourth

00:00:23.586 --> 00:00:25.037
function of money onto this,

00:00:25.037 --> 00:00:29.036
which is that money is the
standard of deferred payment,

00:00:29.036 --> 00:00:31.453
standard of deferred payment.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.120
Now what does this mean, what
does deferred payment mean?

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.164
Basically it's anytime
that you receive something,

00:00:41.164 --> 00:00:42.912
but only pay for it later,

00:00:42.912 --> 00:00:44.910
and the most common form of this is debt.

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.656
So let's say that you, you're over here

00:00:46.656 --> 00:00:49.320
and you want to borrow $1,000.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.070
So you borrow $1,000,

00:00:51.998 --> 00:00:55.000
maybe it's from some kind
of institution like a bank,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.016
and maybe it's a, let's say
it's a $1,000 credit card loan,

00:00:58.016 --> 00:01:00.267
so you receive it, and then
some kind of time passes,

00:01:00.267 --> 00:01:02.192
maybe it's like the month,

00:01:02.192 --> 00:01:03.610
before your credit card bill comes,

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.875
some time passes, and then after that,

00:01:05.875 --> 00:01:07.542
you repay that debt,

00:01:09.198 --> 00:01:11.645
and you'll repay it with money.

00:01:11.645 --> 00:01:13.475
And this is probably the most
common way you're receiving,

00:01:13.475 --> 00:01:14.729
you know, money to use for something

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:15.845
and then you pay it back,

00:01:15.845 --> 00:01:17.564
but there are other forms
of deferred payment,

00:01:17.564 --> 00:01:19.849
like if you go to a
restaurant, for example,

00:01:19.849 --> 00:01:21.344
where you receive your food

00:01:21.344 --> 00:01:23.005
before you pay your bill at the end.

00:01:23.005 --> 00:01:25.004
That would actually be a
form of a deferred payment,

00:01:25.004 --> 00:01:26.657
because, you know, you receive your food

00:01:26.657 --> 00:01:28.580
at the start of the evening,
and then you eat it,

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.153
and it's only at the end that you pay it,

00:01:30.153 --> 00:01:31.918
hopefully, your bill isn't $1,000,

00:01:31.918 --> 00:01:34.267
but it is something where
you're paying it at the end.

00:01:34.267 --> 00:01:37.822
And, in so far as money is
what we use to repay this,

00:01:37.822 --> 00:01:39.733
this is its fourth function.

00:01:39.733 --> 00:01:41.393
And now you might be able
to see why some people

00:01:41.393 --> 00:01:43.704
think that this shouldn't
count as an extra one,

00:01:43.704 --> 00:01:44.692
because you could argue,

00:01:44.692 --> 00:01:47.400
that this falls under the
category of a medium of exchange,

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.039
you know, just in the same
way that you use money

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:53.581
to buy a chair or to buy
legal services or to buy food,

00:01:53.581 --> 00:01:55.597
you're using money to pay your debt,

00:01:55.597 --> 00:01:57.605
it's just another one of those things

00:01:57.605 --> 00:02:00.621
that you're exchanging for, so
why should this be separated?

00:02:00.621 --> 00:02:02.273
Well, one case that you could make

00:02:02.273 --> 00:02:05.189
for why this idea of a
standard of deferred payment

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.652
really does serve a different
function than the others

00:02:07.652 --> 00:02:09.439
is that at least in modern economies,

00:02:09.439 --> 00:02:11.008
there's somewhat of a legal backing

00:02:11.008 --> 00:02:14.025
to the idea of money
serving this standard.

00:02:14.025 --> 00:02:16.725
And by that, I mean, if you
take on a debt, in a country,

00:02:16.725 --> 00:02:18.303
and there's some kind of legal obligation

00:02:18.303 --> 00:02:19.332
attached to that debt,

00:02:19.332 --> 00:02:22.047
associated with the legal
system of the country,

00:02:22.047 --> 00:02:23.975
tied into the law is the idea

00:02:23.975 --> 00:02:27.033
that you can pay back
that debt with money,

00:02:27.033 --> 00:02:30.331
and if you've ever heard
the term legal tender,

00:02:30.331 --> 00:02:33.597
legal tender, this is
what it's referring to.

00:02:33.597 --> 00:02:34.930
So legal tender,

00:02:36.119 --> 00:02:38.337
so you might have heard of,
like, dollar bills, or coins,

00:02:38.337 --> 00:02:40.440
and things like that
being called legal tender,

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.812
and what this means, so legal,

00:02:41.812 --> 00:02:43.293
indicates that there's some association

00:02:43.293 --> 00:02:45.847
with the system of law
within a given country,

00:02:45.847 --> 00:02:50.696
and tender, tender is kind
of an old word for offer.

00:02:50.696 --> 00:02:52.873
And what this basically means
is that if you take on a debt,

00:02:52.873 --> 00:02:54.914
like, you know, you borrow
$1,000 from the bank,

00:02:54.914 --> 00:02:56.804
or you, you know, eat food in a restaurant

00:02:56.804 --> 00:02:59.426
before you pay for it, as
soon as you offer money,

00:02:59.426 --> 00:03:01.854
as soon as you offer something
which is legal tender,

00:03:01.854 --> 00:03:05.063
so like dollar bills, that
debt will no longer exist.

00:03:05.063 --> 00:03:08.370
The act of offering it alone
will eliminate that debt.

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.963
And just as an example of
why this has some bearing,

00:03:10.963 --> 00:03:12.751
consider the fact that
it used to be the case

00:03:12.751 --> 00:03:15.086
people would often take out loans in gold.

00:03:15.086 --> 00:03:16.998
Like in the late 1800s, for example,

00:03:16.998 --> 00:03:18.887
when a lot of railroads were being built

00:03:18.887 --> 00:03:20.394
and there was debt being raised

00:03:20.394 --> 00:03:22.090
to support the building of those,

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.923
it would often be the case

00:03:22.923 --> 00:03:25.521
that one of the men
building these railroads

00:03:25.521 --> 00:03:27.654
might borrow a large sum of money,

00:03:27.654 --> 00:03:31.203
but he would borrow it in
the form of a lot of gold,

00:03:31.203 --> 00:03:32.462
some kind of gold.

00:03:32.462 --> 00:03:34.822
And then it was expected
that he could pay this back,

00:03:34.822 --> 00:03:35.913
you know, in that same form,

00:03:35.913 --> 00:03:38.581
he could pay back the gold itself.

00:03:38.581 --> 00:03:39.715
You know, maybe plus interest,

00:03:39.715 --> 00:03:41.802
this is why people were giving
him gold in the first place,

00:03:41.802 --> 00:03:45.412
and it might be, you know,
maybe, it's just a lot of people

00:03:45.412 --> 00:03:47.105
looking to invest the
gold that they're holding

00:03:47.105 --> 00:03:50.506
and hoping that it returns
some kind of interest.

00:03:50.506 --> 00:03:51.686
Now let's think about what would happen

00:03:51.686 --> 00:03:52.953
if you tried to do this today,

00:03:52.953 --> 00:03:55.838
where for instead of,
you know back in the era,

00:03:55.838 --> 00:03:57.421
you were doing this

00:03:58.671 --> 00:03:59.773
today.

00:03:59.773 --> 00:04:02.477
So let's say you borrowed
like one ounce of gold,

00:04:02.477 --> 00:04:05.025
so it might be one ounce of gold.

00:04:05.025 --> 00:04:07.778
And say that corresponded
today, to $1,000,

00:04:07.778 --> 00:04:11.489
if it was $1,000 for every ounce of gold.

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:13.252
Then let's say while
you're holding onto it,

00:04:13.252 --> 00:04:15.718
you know some time passes,
you're investing in,

00:04:15.718 --> 00:04:17.099
maybe instead of building railroads,

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:18.767
you're doing something
more modern with it,

00:04:18.767 --> 00:04:20.588
but let's say after
enough time has passed,

00:04:20.588 --> 00:04:22.183
the gold has actually gone
up in value, you know,

00:04:22.183 --> 00:04:24.375
maybe there's been inflation
or maybe for whatever reason

00:04:24.375 --> 00:04:26.765
the gold is now a higher
price, and instead,

00:04:26.765 --> 00:04:31.428
instead let's say after
the time, it's now $2,000,

00:04:31.428 --> 00:04:34.859
$2,000 for a single ounce of gold.

00:04:34.859 --> 00:04:36.882
Now if you were to pay back
exactly what you received,

00:04:36.882 --> 00:04:38.587
you would pay back one ounce of gold,

00:04:38.587 --> 00:04:39.883
maybe plus some interest,

00:04:39.883 --> 00:04:42.136
and nobody would have
any reason to complain.

00:04:42.136 --> 00:04:45.214
However, legally, you're
allowed to pay back your debt

00:04:45.214 --> 00:04:47.429
in the form of the legal
tender of the country,

00:04:47.429 --> 00:04:49.070
so for example in the United States,

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:52.289
since your original loan
was in the form of $1,000,

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:56.044
you could pay back,
instead of in gold, $1,000,

00:04:56.044 --> 00:04:59.048
just US dollars, and just by offering that

00:04:59.048 --> 00:05:01.673
to the people who originally
gave you the loan,

00:05:01.673 --> 00:05:04.517
the debt would be gone, but in
effect what this would mean,

00:05:04.517 --> 00:05:06.943
is that you're paying back
half an ounce of gold,

00:05:06.943 --> 00:05:08.512
because after this time
has passed, you know,

00:05:08.512 --> 00:05:10.788
the dollar has devalued relative to gold,

00:05:10.788 --> 00:05:13.830
and instead, $1,000 would only
buy half an ounce of gold,

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:14.888
and you might imagine people

00:05:14.888 --> 00:05:17.282
would be kind of unhappy about that.

00:05:17.282 --> 00:05:18.134
So the whole point here,

00:05:18.134 --> 00:05:20.042
is that the standard of deferred payment

00:05:20.042 --> 00:05:21.865
actually has some legal clout to it,

00:05:21.865 --> 00:05:23.871
so what could, well you
could argue separates it

00:05:23.871 --> 00:05:25.542
from the other functions of money,

00:05:25.542 --> 00:05:27.922
is this fact that the currency
in most modern economies

00:05:27.922 --> 00:05:30.306
is actually tied up with the legal system

00:05:30.306 --> 00:05:31.994
of the associated country.

00:05:31.994 --> 00:05:33.435
So with that, I will see you next video.
