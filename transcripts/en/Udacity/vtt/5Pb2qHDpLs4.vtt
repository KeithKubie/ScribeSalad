00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.270
We're almost ready to start our experiment. Lets

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:04.500
see if you can help me figure out the

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.780
exact steps we're going to go through to extract DNA

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:10.500
from strawberries. Here is a bulleted list of the

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.210
steps for what we're going to do. See if you can put them in the right order

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:16.990
by numbering them from one to five, with one

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.480
being the first event, and five being the last.
