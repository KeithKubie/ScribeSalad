00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.400
Have you ever taken a good look at your nearest
bridge?

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.640
We already know what can happen to a bridge if you don’t consider all the variables before you build one.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:17.860
But what about the ones that work just fine, like the ones you cross every day, like on your commute?

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.640
If you’ve ever stopped to take a look, you might notice that there are cracks in the concrete.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.660
These cracks are a few centimeters thick, and they contain what looks like some kind of metal grating.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.780
The cracks and grating are there for a reason:

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:33.500
They’re called expansion joints, and without them, the bridges would probably have failed a long time ago.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.000
If there are bridges in your town, they probably
have expansion joints, too.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.519
So why are these ugly metal cracks necessary?

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.240
The answer has to do with thermodynamics: the study of temperature, and how it affects matter.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:57.080
[Theme Music]

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.960
So what is temperature, anyway?

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.960
At the most basic level, temperature is a measure of how much kinetic energy -- that is, the energy of motion -- is in a system.

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.440
The hotter something is, the higher its temperature.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.640
It has more kinetic energy, because its atoms
and molecules are moving around more.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.200
And the easiest way to figure out if there’s a temperature difference between two systems is through heat transfer.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.060
The hotter system will always transfer heat
to the colder one.

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.860
And if there’s no heat transfer between
systems at all, that’s called thermal equilibrium.

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.399
But usually, there will be some heat transfer, because that’s how the temperature of a system changes.

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:33.659
And when the temperature of an object changes,
it can undergo what’s known as thermal expansion.

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:39.500
Usually, an increase in temperature will make a solid expand, and a decrease in temperature will make it contract.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.580
Now, there are two main ways that the dimensions of a solid can change, based on a change in temperature.

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.420
It can increase or decrease in length; or
it can increase or decrease in volume.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:54.320
These changes in length and volume work in a very similar way to the changes in length and volume from stress and strain, that we talked about in our episode on statics.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.780
In the case of a bridge, the change is in
its length -- what’s known as linear expansion.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:05.640
And the equation that we use to describe linear expansion, says that the change in length is equal to what’s known as the coefficient of linear expansion

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.460
x the initial length x the change in temperature

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.940
So let’s break down that equation to see
how it works.

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.420
The longer the bridge is to start with, the
more it will expand or contract.

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.220
And the greater the temperature change, the
more it will also expand or contract.

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:24.640
The only other thing that the change in length depends on is that coefficient of linear expansion, represented by the Greek letter alpha.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:33.100
The value for that coefficient depends on the material, and the higher the coefficient is, the more the length of the material will change in response to a change in temperature.

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.320
And that’s why bridges have expansion joints:

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:40.700
to give the concrete room to expand when it’s warmer outside, and contract back down in cooler weather.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.360
Without expansion joints, the concrete would
experience much more stress,

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.260
and you’d be much more likely to end up
with a broken bridge.

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.130
And the same principles apply to other kinds
of expansion.

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:55.080
Volume expansion is just like linear expansion, except that the change happens in all three dimensions.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.420
The equation for volume expansion just says
that the change in volume is

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:03.820
equal to the coefficient of volume expansion, times the initial volume, times the change in temperature.

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:09.240
As with linear expansion, the bigger the object is in the first place, the more it’ll expand or contract.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.200
And a greater temperature change will lead
to a greater change in volume.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:18.600
Finally, the volume change depends on how much of a tendency any particular material has to expand or contract.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.860
That's its coefficient of volume expansion
-- represented by the Greek letter beta.

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.820
But changes in temperature don’t only affect
solids; they also affect gases.

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:32.220
And in gases, temperature has a direct bearing
on the pressure, volume, and amount of the gas;

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.560
all four of those properties are related to
one another.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:41.000
If you’ve taken a chemistry course, like maybe the one Hank hosted, you’re probably already familiar with the concept of an ideal gas:

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.420
a hypothetical gas that obeys a certain set of rules, which lets you describe it more simply.

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:46.680
So, what are these rules?

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.100
Well, an ideal gas is made up of lots of molecules
that move around randomly.

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.820
As they’re zooming around, those molecules
might collide, and bounce off one another,

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:57.200
but they’ll exert no other forces on each
other, outside of these collisions.

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.720
And, the volume of all the gas molecules combined is very small, compared to the volume of the container.

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.180
And in many cases, a real gas is close enough
to an ideal gas, that these assumptions apply.

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:12.240
Which means that we can use the equations that describe ideal gases to describe the behavior of lots of real-life situations, too.

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:16.800
And each of these laws is named after a uniquely awesome individual who lived hundreds of years ago.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.560
The first is called Boyle’s Law.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.020
And it says that as you increase the pressure of a gas while holding the temperature constant,

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.660
the volume of the gas will go down -- and
vice versa.

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:30.640
When you increase the pressure, you’re squeezing the molecules together, so they occupy less space.

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.600
The second basic law is called Charles’s
Law, and it says that:

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:39.880
as you increase the temperature of a gas while holding the pressure constant, the volume of the gas will go up -- and vice versa.

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:46.860
Raising the temperature of the gas gives the molecules more energy, which means they can rocket around more forcefully, expanding the size of the container.

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:53.760
So far, we’ve talked about how the properties of an ideal gas relate to each other when you hold the temperature constant, and when you hold the pressure constant.

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.560
So you can probably guess what the third law
is for: it’s called Gay-Lussac’s Law,

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:04.280
and it says that as you increase the temperature of a gas, while holding the volume constant, the pressure of the gas will go up -- and vice versa.

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:09.860
What’s happening here is that the increase in temperature again gives the gas molecules more energy and a higher speed.

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.920
But this time, the size of the container is
fixed.

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:18.360
So the molecules hit the sides of the container more often, and with more force, increasing the pressure inside.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:25.720
All three of these laws can be combined into one main equation, known simply as the ideal gas law, which also takes into account the amount of the gas:

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:30.540
Pressure times volume is equal to the number
of moles in the gas, x R x the temperature.

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:32.820
Also known as P V equals n R T.

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:34.960
The n stands for the number of moles of the gas.

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:41.200
A mole is just a unit that’s used to measure the amount of a substance -- in this case, a gas, in terms of the number of molecules.

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:46.740
If you have one mole of a gas, it means that you have 6.02 x 10^23 molecules of the stuff.

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:49.760
R, meanwhile, is what’s called the universal gas constant.

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:54.980
It’s a number that connects the pressure and volume of an ideal gas to the number of moles of the gas and its temperature.

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:59.880
And for every ideal gas -- as long as your units are consistent -- R will be exactly the same number.

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:03.520
The ideal gas law includes the three basic laws we just talked about:

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:08.720
how pressure changes with volume, how temperature changes with volume, and how pressure changes with temperature.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:15.920
But instead of talking about each of those relationships individually, it lets you relate all four properties of a gas -- including how much gas you have.

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:20.700
To see all of this in action, let’s consider how the ideal gas law relates to your commute.

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:26.180
Let’s say that as part of your daily routine, you drive to school once in the morning, and once in the afternoon.

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:32.060
It’s pretty chilly in your car as you drive in the morning -- about 285 Kelvin -- and you don’t bother to turn on the heat.

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:38.360
By the time the afternoon comes along, it’s much warmer in your car -- about 300 Kelvin -- but you don’t turn on the air conditioning.

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:42.060
What we want to know is, how many fewer moles of air are there in your car in the afternoon?

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:45.280
Your car isn’t airtight, so molecules of air are free to move in and out.

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:49.620
We’ll say that the volume of the inside of your car, where you sit, is about 5 meters cubed.

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:51.640
And that volume isn’t going to change much.

00:06:51.640 --> 00:07:00.580
The pressure inside your car is going to be equal to the outside air pressure, which we’ll take to be the standard atmospheric pressure, or 101,325 Pascals.

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:04.020
So, how many moles of air were inside your car as you drove to class in the morning?

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:12.140
Well, according to the ideal gas law, the amount of gas in moles is equal to pressure x volume divided by temperature x the universal gas constant.

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:23.160
And 101,325 Pascals x 5 meters cubed, divided by the universal gas constant x 285 Kelvin, is about 214 moles.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:27.600
So there were roughly 214 moles of air in your car when you drove to class in the morning.

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:34.920
Now, how many moles of air were inside your car when you drove home in the afternoon, when it was about 15 Kelvin warmer than in the morning?

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:38.900
We do the same calculation, just this time with temperature equal to 300 Kelvin,

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:43.580
and find that there were only about 203 moles of air inside your car in the afternoon.

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:45.160
That’s a difference of 11 moles!

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:50.560
So there’s about 5.2% less air in your car than there was in the morning, just because it got a little warmer outside.

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:52.220
Today, you learned about temperature.

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:55.600
We talked about thermal expansion, including linear and volume expansion.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:08:00.320
And we went over the ideal gas law, and how to use it to find the number of moles of air in your car.
