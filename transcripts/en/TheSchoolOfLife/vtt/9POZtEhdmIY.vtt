00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:05.870
The normal way we set about trying to extend
our lives is by striving to add more years

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:11.020
to them – usually by eating more couscous
and broccoli, going to bed early and running

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:17.750
in the rain. But this approach may turn out
to be quixotic, not only because Death can’t

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:23.010
reliably be warded off with kale, but at a
deeper level, because the best way to lengthen

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:30.500
a life is not by attempting to stick more
years on to its tail. One of the most basic

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.780
facts about time is that, even though we insist
on measuring it as if it were an objective

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:42.149
unit, it doesn’t, in all conditions, feel
as if it were moving at the same pace. Five

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:49.140
minutes can feel like an hour; ten hours can
feel like five minutes. A decade may pass

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:56.040
like two years; two years may acquire the
weight of half a century. And so on. In other

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:01.760
words, our subjective experience of time bears
precious little relation to the way we like

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:07.500
to measure it on a clock. Time moves more
or less slowly according to the vagaries of

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:16.140
the human mind: it may fly or it may drag.
It may evaporate into airy nothing or achieve

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:23.659
enduring density. If the goal is to have a
longer life, whatever the dieticians may urge,

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:30.450
it seems like the priority should not be to
add raw increments of time but to ensure that

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:38.120
whatever years remain feel appropriately substantial.
The aim should be to densify time rather than

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:44.579
to try to extract one or two more years from
the fickle grip of Death. Why then does time

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:50.590
have such different speeds, moving at certain
points bewilderingly fast, at others with

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:57.960
intricate moderation? The clue is to be found
childhood. The first ten years almost invariably

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.979
feel longer than any other decade we have
on earth. The teens are a little faster but

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:11.329
still crawl. Yet by our 40s, time will have
started to trot; and by our 60s, it will be

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:15.389
unfolding at a bewildering gallop. The difference in pace

00:02:15.389 --> 00:02:23.790
is not mysterious: it has to do with novelty.
The more our days are filled with new, unpredictable

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:30.090
and challenging experiences, the longer they
will feel. And, conversely, the more one day

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:36.159
is exactly like another, the faster it will
pass by in an evanescent blur. Childhood ends

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:42.299
up feeling so long because it is the cauldron
of novelty; because its most ordinary days

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:47.859
are packed with extraordinary discoveries
and sensations: these can be as apparently

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:53.720
minor yet as significant as the first time
we explore the zip on a cardigan or hold our

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.549
nose under water, the first time we look at
the sun through the cotton of a beach towel

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:03.689
or dig our fingers into the putty holding
a window in its frame. Dense as it is with

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:10.249
stimuli, the first decade might as well be
a thousand years long. By middle age, things

00:03:10.249 --> 00:03:14.969
can be counted upon to have grown a lot more
familiar. We may have flown around the world

00:03:14.969 --> 00:03:20.879
a few times. We no longer get excited by the
idea of eating a pineapple, owning a car or

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:26.939
flipping a lightswitch. We know about relationships,
earning money and telling others what do.

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:33.519
And as a result, time runs away from us without
mercy. One solution often suggested at this

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:38.459
point is that we should put all our efforts
into discovering fresh sources of novelty.

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:43.260
We can’t just continue to live our small
predictable and therefore ‘swift’ lives

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:49.159
in a single narrow domain; we need to become
explorers and adventurers. We must go to Machu

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:54.709
Picchu or Angkor Wat, Astana or Montevideo,
we need to find a way to swim with dolphins

00:03:54.709 --> 00:04:00.159
or order a thirteen course meal at a world-famous
restaurant in downtown Lima. That will finally

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:07.589
slow down the cruel gallop of time. But this
is to labour under an unfair, expensive and

00:04:07.589 --> 00:04:13.549
ultimately impractical notion of novelty.
We may by middle age certainly have seen a

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:18.879
great many things in our neighborhoods, but
we are – fortunately for us – unlikely

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:24.090
to have properly noticed most of them. We
have probably taken a few cursory glances

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:29.960
at the miracles of existence that lie to hand
and assumed, quite unjustly, that we know

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:35.220
all there is to know about them. We’ve imagined
we understand the city we live in, the people

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:41.510
we interact with and, more or less, the point
of it all. But of course we have barely scratched

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:47.389
the surface. We have grown bored of a world
we haven’t begun to study properly. And

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:55.800
that, among other things, is why time is racing
by. The pioneers at making life feel longer

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:03.490
in the way that counts are not dieticians,
but artists. At its best, art is a tool that

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:09.320
reminds us of how little we have fathomed
and noticed. It re-introduces us to ordinary

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:15.490
things and reopens our eyes to a latent beauty
and interest in precisely those areas we had

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:23.060
ceased to bother with. It helps us to recover
some of the manic sensitivity we had as newborns.

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:28.770
Here is Cezanne, looking closely at apples,
as if he had never seen one before and nudging

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:37.480
us to do likewise: Here is Van Gogh, mesmerised
by some oranges: Here is Albrecht Durer, looking

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:42.439
– as only children usually do – very closely
at a clod of earth:

00:05:42.439 --> 00:05:46.580
We don’t need to make art
in order to learn the most valuable lesson

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:53.060
of artists, which is about noticing properly,
living with our eyes open – and thereby,

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:58.159
along the way, savouring time. Without any
intention to create something that could be

00:05:58.159 --> 00:06:03.699
put in a gallery, we could – as part of
a goal of living more deliberately – take

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:09.319
a walk in an unfamiliar part of town, ask
an old friend about a side of their life we’d

00:06:09.319 --> 00:06:14.250
never dared to probe at, lie on our back in
the garden and look up at the stars or hold

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:20.389
our partner in a way we never tried before.
It takes a rabid lack of imagination to think

00:06:20.389 --> 00:06:27.240
we have to go to Machu Picchu to find something
new. In Fyodor Dostoevsky’s novel The Idiot,

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:32.080
a prisoner has suddenly been condemned to
death and been told he has only a few minutes

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:38.050
left to live. ‘What if I were not to die!,’
he exclaims. ‘What if life were given back

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:45.530
to me – what infinity!… I’d turn a whole
minute into an age…’ Faced with losing

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:51.960
his life, the poor wretch recognises that
every minute could be turned into aeons of

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:59.650
time, with sufficient imagination and appreciation.
It is sensible enough to try to live longer

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:05.439
lives. But we are working with a false notion
of what long really means. We might live to

00:07:05.439 --> 00:07:11.389
be a thousand years old and still complain
that it had all rushed by too fast. We should

00:07:11.389 --> 00:07:17.150
be aiming to lead lives that feel long because
we have managed to imbue them with the right

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:24.050
sort of open-hearted appreciation and unsnobbish
receptivity, the kind that five-year-olds

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:29.909
know naturally how to bring to bear. We need
to pause and look at one another’s faces,

00:07:29.909 --> 00:07:34.949
study the evening sky, wonder at the eddies
and colours of the river and dare to ask the

00:07:34.949 --> 00:07:41.569
kind of questions that open our souls. We
don’t need to add years; we need to densify

00:07:41.569 --> 00:07:47.400
the time we have left by ensuring that every
day is lived consciously – and we can do

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:55.389
this via a manoeuvre as simple as it is momentous:
by starting to notice all that we have as

00:07:55.389 --> 00:07:57.120
yet only seen.

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:09.440
Our Wisdom Display Cards explore what it really means to be wise and how we can strive to become more enlightened in our every day lives.
