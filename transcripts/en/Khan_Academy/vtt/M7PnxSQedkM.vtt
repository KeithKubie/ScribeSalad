00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.860
Now that we know a little bit
about oxidation and reduction,

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:06.540
what I want to do is
really just do an exercise

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.880
to just make sure that we
can at least give our best

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.750
shot at figuring
out the oxidation

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:15.810
states for the constituent
atoms that make up a compound.

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:18.750
So, for example, here
I have magnesium oxide,

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.360
which is used in cement.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.100
It has other applications.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.360
And this is magnesium
hydroxide, which

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.960
is actually used in antacids.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.740
It's used in deodorant.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.650
And what I want
you to think about,

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:32.980
and I encourage you to
pause this video right now,

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.430
is given these two molecules,
these two compounds,

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.190
and what we know about
the periodic table,

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.100
try to come up
with the oxidation

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.730
states for the different
elements in each

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.190
of these compounds.

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.814
So I'm assuming that
you've given a go at it.

00:00:49.814 --> 00:00:51.230
Now let's try to
work through this

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.450
or think through this together.

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:55.570
So first of all, magnesium.

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.030
Magnesium right over here.

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.570
We see it's group two.

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.280
It's an alkaline earth metal.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.180
It has two valence electrons.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.080
It's not that electronegative.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.960
We've already seen that
something in this group right

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.520
over here with two
valence electrons,

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.550
it's likely to give them away.

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:14.786
So if it were to
form ionic bonds,

00:01:14.786 --> 00:01:16.160
or if it were to
be ionized, it's

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.860
likely to lose two electrons.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.990
If you lose two electrons, you
would have a plus 2 charge.

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.530
So magnesium would typically
have a plus 2 oxidation state.

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.980
On the other side of the
periodic table, oxygen,

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:31.350
group seven.

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.080
It has six valence electrons.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.240
It's very electronegative, so
electronegative that oxidation

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.230
is named for it.

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.990
It likes to take electrons
from other elements.

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.290
And oxygen in particular
likes to take two electrons.

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.009
So it's not unusual to
see, actually anything

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:47.550
in this group, but
especially oxygen,

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.770
taking two electrons
from something else.

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.234
If you take two electrons,
and you started off neutrally,

00:01:52.234 --> 00:01:53.650
or you started in
a neutral state,

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:59.410
it's not unusual to see oxygen
at a negative 2 oxidation

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:00.440
state.

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.020
So given that, it seems
like this could work out.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:09.312
Magnesium could have a
positive 2 oxidation state.

00:02:09.312 --> 00:02:11.520
And actually when you write
it as a superscript here,

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.870
the convention is to write
the positive after the 2.

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:20.870
And oxygen would have or could
have a negative 2 oxidation

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:21.670
state.

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.210
And this makes sense relative
to the overall charge

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:26.360
of the molecule.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.735
Positive 2 plus negative
2 is going to be 0.

00:02:28.735 --> 00:02:29.610
And that makes sense.

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.310
This thing overall is
a neutral molecule.

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.600
And not only in this
case is the oxidation

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.490
state a hypothetical
ionic charge,

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.950
if these were to be ionic
bonds, this actually

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.890
is an ionic compound.

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.810
Oxygen actually does
take two electrons.

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.740
And magnesium actually does
give away two electrons.

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:50.510
So in this case
the oxidation state

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.791
is actually describing what
is happening ionically.

00:02:54.791 --> 00:02:56.290
Now let's think
about this one right

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.060
over here, magnesium hydroxide.

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.660
Well, just like before,
magnesium typically has

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.450
an oxidation state, likes
to give away its electrons.

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:10.440
So it could have an oxidation
state of positive 2,

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.160
which would imply that the
entire hydroxide anion--

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.430
And let's just say
hydroxide for now.

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:18.850
Well I'll say hydroxide anion.

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.370
I kind of gave it away a little
bit-- that this hydroxide,

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.100
or this part of the
molecule, the right-hand part

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.520
of what I've written here, for
this whole thing to be neutral,

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.350
it should have a negative
2 oxidation state.

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.290
Now how does that make sense?

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.480
Well we have two
hydroxides here.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.520
Notice this subscript
right over here.

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:45.460
So if each of those hydroxides
has a negative 1 charge,

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:48.280
or a negative 1, I guess you
could say, total oxidation

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.570
state, then when you take
two of them together,

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:53.590
they would net out
against the magnesium.

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.650
And that does seem
to make sense.

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:00.010
If oxygen has a negative
2 oxidation state,

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.060
hydrogen has a positive
1 oxidation state.

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.600
Each hydroxide part
of this molecule

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.585
is going to have a net
oxidation state of negative 1.

00:04:11.585 --> 00:04:13.100
But then you have two of them.

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:15.210
So the net oxidation
for this part

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:17.680
of the molecule
or the compound is

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.170
going to be negative 2 nets
out with the positive 2

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:22.660
from magnesium.

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.530
So once again, it makes sense.
