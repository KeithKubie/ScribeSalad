00:00:01.167 --> 00:00:03.102
You might remember Donald
Trump's lawyer, Michael Cohen,

00:00:03.135 --> 00:00:05.104
for this classic legal argument.

00:00:05.137 --> 00:00:07.106
But you guys are down,

00:00:07.139 --> 00:00:09.976
-and it makes sense
that there would... -Says who?

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:11.711
-Polls.
-Says who?

00:00:11.744 --> 00:00:13.680
Most of them. All of them?

00:00:17.383 --> 00:00:18.885
Says who?

00:00:18.918 --> 00:00:21.554
(laughter, shouts)

00:00:21.587 --> 00:00:23.856
-Boom!
-That is...

00:00:23.889 --> 00:00:26.292
-No...
-That is...

00:00:26.325 --> 00:00:29.395
-No...
-That is...

00:00:29.428 --> 00:00:32.265
that is maybe some of Hugh
Laurie's best character work.

00:00:32.298 --> 00:00:33.766
HARDWICK:
It's so good.

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:36.102
Yeah, you know, the last season
of<i> House</i> got real weird.

00:00:36.135 --> 00:00:37.804
-Says who? Says who?
-Says who?

00:00:37.837 --> 00:00:39.772
-Says who?
-It's nice to know that if he

00:00:39.805 --> 00:00:42.375
or Trump ever get in trouble,
their defense is gonna be:

00:00:42.408 --> 00:00:45.078
-"A bitch says what?”
-(laughter)

00:00:45.111 --> 00:00:47.814
I like his confidence.
I want to use that the next time

00:00:47.847 --> 00:00:50.249
someone tries to break up
with me-- I'll just be like,

00:00:50.282 --> 00:00:53.119
-"Says who?"
-(laughter)

00:00:53.152 --> 00:00:54.787
(whooping, applause)

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.524
Hundred points to Esther
for that.

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:03.729
Now Cohen's tweeting out divine
proof that Donald is gonna win.

00:01:03.762 --> 00:01:05.465
This cloud. Hmm.

00:01:05.498 --> 00:01:08.134
-And he says...
-(laughter)

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.005
And he wrote:
"In case anyone is unsure

00:01:13.038 --> 00:01:14.974
"as to who will be
our next POTUS,

00:01:15.007 --> 00:01:17.176
the Lord has chosen
the people's messenger.”

00:01:17.209 --> 00:01:18.644
(laughter)

00:01:18.677 --> 00:01:20.646
And those little tiny
cloud hands at the bottom

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:23.249
are just giving us all
the finger.

00:01:23.282 --> 00:01:26.652
(whooping, applause)

00:01:26.685 --> 00:01:29.555
Comedians, what's the weather
report for this picture?

00:01:29.588 --> 00:01:33.192
-Yes, Jay. -We have a dumb front
moving in from the east.

00:01:33.225 --> 00:01:34.560
(laughter)

00:01:34.593 --> 00:01:36.129
-(whooping, applause)
-Points.

00:01:36.162 --> 00:01:39.065
I can leave it at that.
I'll leave it at that.

00:01:39.098 --> 00:01:40.399
Randy.

00:01:40.432 --> 00:01:42.201
See, I think it's
more complicated than that.

00:01:42.234 --> 00:01:44.971
That is a very difficult
weather system to predict.

00:01:45.004 --> 00:01:46.939
It is a severe tornado warning,

00:01:46.972 --> 00:01:49.976
-but only for Latinos, so, uh...
-(laughter, groaning)

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.044
HARDWICK:
Oh, (bleep).

00:01:52.077 --> 00:01:53.746
The cloud knows.

00:01:53.779 --> 00:01:55.748
The cloud knows where to go.

00:01:55.781 --> 00:01:58.217
And I... I think
those wisps of clouds

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:59.719
were taken from another cloud

00:01:59.752 --> 00:02:02.088
-and put on top of that cloud.
Yeah. -And put on top.

00:02:02.121 --> 00:02:04.223
-You think it was
a cloud transplant. -Yes, I do.

00:02:04.256 --> 00:02:05.625
Esther.

00:02:05.658 --> 00:02:08.327
Cloudy with a chance of a guy
who looks like meatballs.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.560
Yes, points!
Very good, very good.
