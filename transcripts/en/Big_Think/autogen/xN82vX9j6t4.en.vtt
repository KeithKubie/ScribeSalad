00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830
 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.289
one of the questions I get asked most

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:13.299
one of the questions I get asked most
 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:15.990
one of the questions I get asked most
commonly as an astronomer is if almost

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:16.000
commonly as an astronomer is if almost
 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.550
commonly as an astronomer is if almost
all the galaxies in the universe are

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:17.560
all the galaxies in the universe are
 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.340
all the galaxies in the universe are
flying away from us in space why is the

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:20.350
flying away from us in space why is the
 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:22.200
flying away from us in space why is the
Andromeda galaxy getting closer to us

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:22.210
Andromeda galaxy getting closer to us
 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:23.910
Andromeda galaxy getting closer to us
does that somehow mean that the Big Bang

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:23.920
does that somehow mean that the Big Bang
 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.830
does that somehow mean that the Big Bang
works differently in different parts of

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:25.840
works differently in different parts of
 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:26.490
works differently in different parts of
the universe

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:26.500
the universe
 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.189
the universe
and the answer simply is no space is

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:29.199
and the answer simply is no space is
 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:31.499
and the answer simply is no space is
expanding because of the Big Bang all of

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:31.509
expanding because of the Big Bang all of
 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:33.150
expanding because of the Big Bang all of
space is expanding in every direction

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:33.160
space is expanding in every direction
 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.030
space is expanding in every direction
all at once and from our viewpoint that

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:36.040
all at once and from our viewpoint that
 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.830
all at once and from our viewpoint that
means that it looks like all the other

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:37.840
means that it looks like all the other
 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.040
means that it looks like all the other
galaxies are moving away from us but not

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.050
galaxies are moving away from us but not
 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:42.810
galaxies are moving away from us but not
all the universe around us appears to be

all the universe around us appears to be
 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.270
all the universe around us appears to be
expanding for example the earth doesn't

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.280
expanding for example the earth doesn't
 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.619
expanding for example the earth doesn't
seem to be getting any farther away from

00:00:46.619 --> 00:00:46.629
seem to be getting any farther away from
 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:49.290
seem to be getting any farther away from
the Sun the Sun is not getting any

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:49.300
the Sun the Sun is not getting any
 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.229
the Sun the Sun is not getting any
farther away from our galaxy think about

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:52.239
farther away from our galaxy think about
 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:54.389
farther away from our galaxy think about
smaller scales like your body your body

00:00:54.389 --> 00:00:54.399

luckily is not expanding along with the

00:00:56.939 --> 00:00:56.949
luckily is not expanding along with the
 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:00:59.639
luckily is not expanding along with the
universe and the reason is that the

00:00:59.639 --> 00:00:59.649
universe and the reason is that the
 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:01.410
universe and the reason is that the
expansion of the universe is actually a

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420
expansion of the universe is actually a
 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.779
expansion of the universe is actually a
pretty gentle force you really only

00:01:03.779 --> 00:01:03.789
pretty gentle force you really only
 

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:05.910
pretty gentle force you really only
notice it our in the middle of nowhere

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920
notice it our in the middle of nowhere
 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.370
notice it our in the middle of nowhere
in the vast reaches of space between the

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380
in the vast reaches of space between the
 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.500
in the vast reaches of space between the
galaxies there's a lot of space out

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:10.510
galaxies there's a lot of space out
 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:12.240
galaxies there's a lot of space out
there so there's a lot of space to

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250
there so there's a lot of space to
 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.490
there so there's a lot of space to
expand and so you really notice this

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500
expand and so you really notice this
 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.010
expand and so you really notice this
expansion but there are things that are

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020
expansion but there are things that are
 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.130
expansion but there are things that are
stronger than the expansion force for

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140
stronger than the expansion force for
 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.470
stronger than the expansion force for

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:22.480
example my body is held together by
 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.720
example my body is held together by
chemical forces and by electrical forces

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:24.730
chemical forces and by electrical forces
 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:27.930

that is much much stronger than the tiny

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:27.940
that is much much stronger than the tiny
 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.030
that is much much stronger than the tiny
little push the space has to expand

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.040

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.540
little push the space has to expand
inside me I hold together very well one

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:33.550
inside me I hold together very well one

inside me I hold together very well one
of the analogies I think about is you

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:35.290
of the analogies I think about is you
 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.560
of the analogies I think about is you

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570
could try to push over the Empire State
 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:38.990

Building by blowing on it

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000
Building by blowing on it
 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.490
Building by blowing on it
you are actually exerting a force on the

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500
you are actually exerting a force on the
 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:42.960
you are actually exerting a force on the
Empire State Building by blowing on it

Empire State Building by blowing on it
 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.180
Empire State Building by blowing on it
you can measure that force but you're

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:45.190
you can measure that force but you're
 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:46.560
you can measure that force but you're
not gonna blow over the Empire State

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570
not gonna blow over the Empire State
 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.300
not gonna blow over the Empire State
Building there are things that are much

that's also true of the galaxy we are

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500
that's also true of the galaxy we are
 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.590
that's also true of the galaxy we are
held in orbit around the center of the

galaxy gravitationally that's much

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880
galaxy gravitationally that's much
 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.020
galaxy gravitationally that's much
stronger than any expansion force so why

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030
stronger than any expansion force so why
 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.240
stronger than any expansion force so why

that the gravity between
 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.229
that the gravity between
the two is strong enough for the two to

the two is strong enough for the two to
 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:19.720
the two is strong enough for the two to
start moving together yes space is

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730
start moving together yes space is
 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.339

expanding between us and the Andromeda

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:21.349
expanding between us and the Andromeda
 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:24.309
expanding between us and the Andromeda
galaxy but gravity is accelerating

Andromeda toward us faster than that

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:26.269
Andromeda toward us faster than that
 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:28.449
Andromeda toward us faster than that
expansion and in fact that means that

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459
expansion and in fact that means that
 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:30.040
expansion and in fact that means that
Andromeda is going to collide with the

away from each other that the
 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.220
away from each other that the
gravitational force is weaker and the

or whether in fact that expansion force
 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.420
or whether in fact that expansion force
will keep getting stronger will there be

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430
will keep getting stronger will there be
 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.759

the earth are actually pulled apart by
the expansion of the universe and

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:32.299
the expansion of the universe and
 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:33.819
the expansion of the universe and
perhaps most intriguingly

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:33.829
perhaps most intriguingly

will there ever come a time when the

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660
will there ever come a time when the
 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.240
will there ever come a time when the
expansion of the universe is strong them

big rip and it's one of the possible

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:46.579
big rip and it's one of the possible
 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:48.520
big rip and it's one of the possible
ends of the universe that the expansion

literally rips everything apart we don't

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450
literally rips everything apart we don't
 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:55.870
literally rips everything apart we don't
know whether this will happen yet so we

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880
know whether this will happen yet so we
 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.670
know whether this will happen yet so we
have a lot more investigating to do

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680
have a lot more investigating to do
 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.559
have a lot more investigating to do
about this thing called dark energy that

00:03:59.559 --> 00:03:59.569
about this thing called dark energy that
 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:01.030
about this thing called dark energy that
may be accelerating the universe and

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040
may be accelerating the universe and
 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.710
may be accelerating the universe and
that's one of the best questions are

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720
that's one of the best questions are
 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.840
that's one of the best questions are
trying to answer right now
