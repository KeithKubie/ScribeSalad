00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.040
 0: 05.0 Trying to lose weight can be difficult, and while we all know a good combination of exercise 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.870
 Diet is necessary, which one is more important? If you have to choose, you must be among 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:13.010
 Gym, or diet? 

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:17.609
 There are many ways that you can burn a few hundred calories. Run for 20 minutes, an hour 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:23.510
 From surfing, or singing your favorite song 23 times - actually we have a full dedicated video 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:28.730
 To exotic ways of burning calories. But the point is that it takes time to burn the amount 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:34.329
 Great calories even with great activity - not to mention the extra barrier of moving 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:36.870
 To the gym, and then return home. 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.550
 For now, compare this to the number of calories, to transport, chocolate bar - which is often 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.430
 More than 200 calories. You could either walk for about an hour to burn that 200 calories, or 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.920
 You could simply not eat chocolate. Which seems easier for you? How about activity 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.649
 For 30 minutes every day or dispense those two cans of soda? Many doctors point out 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.350
 That there is a lot of high sugar, high fat and high calorie foods that can reduce our diet, 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.390
 To learn the results of weight loss faster. 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:11.540
 Studies tend to show that diet plays a greater role in weight loss than exercise. 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.250
 The 2011 meta-analysis of children found that the level of physical activity was not 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:22.000
 The main determinant of me is to underestimate their weight. A study of 3000 adults found that reduces 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.400
 Calories were linked to more diet and weight loss than exercise alone. Furthermore it, 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.060
 Studies comparing industrial and developing countries indicate that the rate of physical activity 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.640
 Somewhat similar between the two communities, making activity and exercise charged with increasing 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.850
 Rates of obesity in the industrialized world. 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:45.110
 Of course, the combination of diet and exercise will yield better results in the long term. 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:50.740
 Exercise has many health benefits after weight loss, such as slowing the aging process and improving 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.000
 Mental health. But in the end, if you are looking to lose weight you 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.110
