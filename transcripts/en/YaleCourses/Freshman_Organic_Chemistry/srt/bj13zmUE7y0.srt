1
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:02,101
At the end.

2
00:00:02,101 --> 00:00:07,101
Last time we saw this in temperate quote
from a Herrmann Colby on the young van

3
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:13,200
off the fancy trifles in it.

4
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:18,240
His book about the arrangement of atoms
in space are totally devoid of any

5
00:00:18,241 --> 00:00:22,110
factual reality. The reason he
thought, so Colby was the new,

6
00:00:22,111 --> 00:00:25,620
there could be no way of knowing about
the arrangement of atoms in space.

7
00:00:25,621 --> 00:00:29,130
They were just too small,
but he was wrong.

8
00:00:29,131 --> 00:00:30,960
There was plenty of factual reality.

9
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:36,590
What van Hoff it did was they had
done was to collect information about

10
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,550
isomerism particular about
optically active compounds.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,800
Those that rotated the plane of polarized
light or twisted it. Uh, I've noticed,

12
00:00:46,801 --> 00:00:50,850
uh, in looking at the Wiki, I noticed
some people talk about bending it.

13
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,580
Bending would be like this,
right?

14
00:00:53,581 --> 00:00:58,050
That's not what happens to the plane of
light as it goes. It goes and it twists,

15
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,720
right? It rotates, it doesn't
bend. Bending is refractive index,

16
00:01:03,721 --> 00:01:06,300
you know, like goes into the
surface of water. And then Ben's,

17
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:09,630
but this is twisting the,
the direction of the,

18
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:13,050
that the electric vector oscillates.
Okay.

19
00:01:13,051 --> 00:01:17,160
So these optically active compounds
that would do that when in solution,

20
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:18,300
uh,

21
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:23,300
were numerous and van Hoff was
able to cite a number of examples.

22
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:28,680
For example, lactic acid, but you
remember who discovered lactic acid,

23
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:33,360
Shayla already, you know, close
to a hundred years before this,

24
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:36,180
Shayla had isolated it from sour milk,

25
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:41,300
but liebig then found the same
analysis of the acid he got from,

26
00:01:41,431 --> 00:01:45,600
uh, from meat, isolated it
from meat and vistola say news.

27
00:01:45,601 --> 00:01:48,660
At this same time that van
Hoff is working. In fact,

28
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,960
the guy who had one of his
helpers translate the work
of Anton into German for

29
00:01:55,531 --> 00:01:58,920
that publication and was
therefore castigated by Colby.

30
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:04,250
This Luiseno showed that these things
had the same connectivity by chemical

31
00:02:04,321 --> 00:02:07,680
transformation. These two, uh, acids,

32
00:02:07,681 --> 00:02:12,570
the one from milk and the one
from meat, right? If you look, uh,

33
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,890
40 years later in the
encyclopedia Britannica.

34
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:21,360
So this is a long time afterwards,
right? Uh, about lactic acid.

35
00:02:21,361 --> 00:02:26,361
It says it's hydroxy propionic acid to
lactic acids are known differing from

36
00:02:28,171 --> 00:02:32,130
each other in the position occupied
by the hydroxyl group in the molecule.

37
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:36,300
They are known respectively as
Alpha Hydroxy propionic acid.

38
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:37,950
You remember what Alpha means?

39
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:43,440
It means on the carbon adjacent
to a carbon eel group. Okay,

40
00:02:43,441 --> 00:02:45,840
so there's Alpha hydroxy propionic acid,

41
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,530
which came from fermentation and it's
called inactive lactic acid. Why would,

42
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:53,460
why would they call it inactive?
In what sense? Inactive.

43
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:57,630
And you think what active
versus inactive would mean?

44
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:02,800
It means whether it's able to rotate
the twist, the plane of polarized light,

45
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:07,210
whether it's optically active. Okay.
Inactive lactic acid and it gives the,

46
00:03:07,211 --> 00:03:10,780
they give the formula with an o h on
the carbon next to the carbon eel of the

47
00:03:10,781 --> 00:03:15,781
acid group and three hydroxy
propionic acid or hydrochloric acid,

48
00:03:15,941 --> 00:03:20,290
which has the Oah on the terminal
carbon, right? Then they go.

49
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:23,680
Now these are clearly
constitutional isomers.

50
00:03:23,681 --> 00:03:28,480
It's a different sequence of bonds,
but they go on to say,

51
00:03:28,481 --> 00:03:33,481
although on structural
grounds there should be only
two hydroxy propionic acids.

52
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,880
These two,
as a matter of fact,

53
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:42,060
for lactic acids are known the third ice
summer in addition to the inactive one

54
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,970
and the one that has the
Oah on the last carbon.

55
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:50,890
The third is sarco lactic acid.
SARCO means from flesh.

56
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:55,240
Okay. So that's the one
that leave [inaudible] found
in meat extract. In fact,

57
00:03:55,420 --> 00:04:00,070
Lubick was so, uh, interested in
meat extract that there that he, uh,

58
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,233
that he,
uh,

59
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:06,480
patented bullion cubes and they were
known for a long time as leavings material

60
00:04:06,641 --> 00:04:08,800
or whatever. I forget exactly. But, uh,

61
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:13,030
I once looked at a train menu from
the late 19th century, you know,

62
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,920
in the restaurant car, the train, and they
were serving leavings extract. Okay. So,

63
00:04:17,921 --> 00:04:20,530
uh, uh, so there was,

64
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,760
there's the third one is [inaudible] the
sarco lactic acid and may be prepared

65
00:04:24,761 --> 00:04:28,090
by the action of penicillium
Glau Coombe on, uh,

66
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:31,150
on the solution of
ordinary ammonium lactate.

67
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:36,540
It is identical with Alpha hydroxy
propionic acid in almost every respect.

68
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:42,130
Right. Except with regards
to its physical properties.

69
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:44,800
That's sort of an interesting statement,
isn't it?

70
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:51,150
That it's identical in every respect
except it's all different. Right.

71
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:53,230
What,
what was similar about it do you think?

72
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,170
Yeah.

73
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:58,440
In what way was it identical?
If it had all its boiling point?

74
00:04:58,441 --> 00:05:02,880
Everything was different. Melting point,
crystal form, everything was different.

75
00:05:02,881 --> 00:05:04,020
All the physical properties,

76
00:05:04,021 --> 00:05:08,910
but how could they possibly say it
is identical in almost every respect.

77
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:11,463
Kevin,

78
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:14,080
what about as far Mulan?

79
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:17,490
Obviously it's their isover so
they have the same composition,

80
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,990
but the constitution is the same.
The sequence of bonds, right?

81
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:25,650
The fourth isomer formed
by the action of Bacillus,

82
00:05:25,651 --> 00:05:30,651
Levo Laconte on cane sugar resembles
sarco lactic acid in every respect except

83
00:05:32,131 --> 00:05:36,630
in its action on polarized light.
So one rotated it to the right,

84
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:39,780
the other rotated to the left.
And now the of every other respect,

85
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,500
they were identical. So
there were four. Okay. Right.

86
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:48,600
Left and inactive. Okay. But here,

87
00:05:48,601 --> 00:05:53,190
40 years after, they don't give any
explanation of why that should be. So,

88
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:58,340
okay. Tartaric acid, we've
seen a lot, right? Shale up,

89
00:05:58,341 --> 00:06:03,290
but say alias coined the name
Isomer to talk about it. Pastor uh,

90
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:08,240
Vistola Zeno's again showed
the constitution, which
meant nothing to posture.

91
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:13,390
Why would the constitution mean nothing
to pastor the nature and sequence of

92
00:06:14,581 --> 00:06:15,414
bonds?

93
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:16,343
Yeah.

94
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:26,460
Would posture have written at the
time he did this work? Uh, uh,

95
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:28,880
we don't know anything
about the position of bonds.

96
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,310
I don't think he would've written that.
You know why?

97
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:35,570
Okay.

98
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:38,330
Bonds wouldn't be invented
for another 10 years.

99
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,280
There was no such thing as bonds.

100
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:44,210
When posture it is work
in 1848 bonds came in 1858

101
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,430
right?

102
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:50,060
So pastor had,
didn't have the tools to think about this.

103
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:55,520
Okay. So aspartic acid was an example
of something that was optically active.

104
00:06:55,521 --> 00:06:59,510
Angel Alcohol Could Rotate Light
Glucose could rotate light.

105
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,590
Notice that this didn't mean they had
both the one that could rotate one way and

106
00:07:03,591 --> 00:07:05,270
the one that could rotate the other way.

107
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,750
They had something that could rotate
light. In the case of lactic acid,

108
00:07:08,751 --> 00:07:11,420
they had things that would
rotate either way, right?

109
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:16,310
In the case of tartaric acid after
posture or they had that. Okay.

110
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:20,720
And also [inaudible] and lactose were
another two that were known but were not

111
00:07:20,721 --> 00:07:24,800
cited by van Hoff. Uh, malic acid.

112
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:26,150
You know what that comes from?

113
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,420
Where's the root now?

114
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:31,853
Hm.

115
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:36,100
It's apples, right? So
it's sour apples. Okay.

116
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:38,920
And most of the derivatives
of these compounds,

117
00:07:38,921 --> 00:07:42,970
most things you could get by chemical
transformations from these compounds were

118
00:07:42,971 --> 00:07:44,170
optically active.

119
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:48,640
But not the stuff you got
by dehydrating malic acid.

120
00:07:48,641 --> 00:07:49,870
If you got the double bond.

121
00:07:49,871 --> 00:07:54,250
So you got Malik and
fumaric acid two isomers,

122
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:58,780
but they didn't, neither of the
rotated light either right or left.

123
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:01,650
Right.
So that was destroyed in this case.

124
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:06,950
And also there was another example which
was replacing the Oah by a hydrogen.

125
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:11,060
So you have ch two ch two in
the middle instead of Cho,

126
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,330
h c h two.

127
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:17,220
And that particular experiment
van Hoff was involved in,

128
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:20,940
he was involved in by
suggesting it to his coat,

129
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
his fellow student Bremmer,
right,

130
00:08:24,001 --> 00:08:26,790
who did it by treating it with
hydro chaotic acid and phosphorus,

131
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:31,080
which was a way of removing ohs and
changing them to hydrogen in those days.

132
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:34,500
We'll see later that that's
called reduction. But at any rate,

133
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:39,870
there were these two derivatives of malic
acid that we're not optically active,

134
00:08:39,871 --> 00:08:43,370
although most derivatives were.
Okay.

135
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,590
Now van Hoff is,
I said,

136
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:49,690
was involved at least in
suggesting these experiments. Uh,

137
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:53,780
and as we said, those two are
inactive in Van Hoff's obituary,

138
00:08:53,781 --> 00:08:58,430
a former student of his band crop
to was by this time of professor at,

139
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,920
at Cornell wrote in his whole life,

140
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:05,190
he never made what would be called
a very accurate measurement.

141
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:10,200
And he never cared too.
I remember his saying to be 18 years ago,

142
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:14,250
how fortunate is there are other people
who will do that sort of work for us,

143
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,340
right?
So it's great to do experiments,

144
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:20,640
but in some sense it's even greater
if you can talk somebody else who's

145
00:09:20,641 --> 00:09:25,050
confident and to do them for you. Okay.
And that's, that was van Hoff's approach.

146
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:26,191
Now,

147
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:30,150
what Van Hoff noticed was that these
compounds that were optically active all

148
00:09:30,151 --> 00:09:33,960
had something in common.
They all had these red,

149
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,220
Adam's in common.

150
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:40,340
What's special about the carbons that
are red that exist in the ones that are

151
00:09:41,131 --> 00:09:45,810
optically active but don't exist in
the ones that are not optically active?

152
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:50,610
Why are the, what's special about the
ones that are in Italics and read?

153
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:55,260
What makes them different? This
is what Vantiff noticed, Chris.

154
00:09:56,850 --> 00:10:00,120
Well they are, but what,
what did van Hoff notice?

155
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:02,790
Chiral didn't exist then as a name?

156
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:04,493
Yeah,

157
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,340
they all have bought,

158
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:11,810
they use their four bonds
to bond to different groups.

159
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:14,510
No two things are the same.
Down here,

160
00:10:14,511 --> 00:10:18,110
this carbon that was red
here has two hydrogens on it.

161
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:22,340
Here it has two bonds to another carbon,
right?

162
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:25,430
But in the other cases, there
are, all these red carbons are,

163
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:29,570
are unique in bonding to for different
things. This one, for example,

164
00:10:29,571 --> 00:10:32,510
this carbon is bonded
to hydrogen, two O, h,

165
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:37,960
two n another carbon that goes out on
this chain and another carbon that goes

166
00:10:38,091 --> 00:10:40,550
out on that chain.
And those two chains are different.

167
00:10:40,551 --> 00:10:43,110
This one has a carbonyl
group that has an Oah.

168
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:46,850
So the difference can be quite remote,
but they're different.

169
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:49,700
Okay.
So that's what he noticed.

170
00:10:49,701 --> 00:10:54,701
And he called and we now call these chiral
carbons or stereo genic because they

171
00:10:55,371 --> 00:10:59,480
give rise to special stereo
arrangement in space.

172
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:04,190
So what he said was every carbon compound,

173
00:11:04,191 --> 00:11:09,191
which in solution can rotate the plane
of polarized light contains one or more

174
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:14,180
asymmetric carbon atoms.
That's what he called these.

175
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:16,040
That had four different things

176
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,430
and he made models of carbon.

177
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,010
This particular set,
he folded up,

178
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:30,160
colored the pasted together and gave
to this friend Bremmer who had done the

179
00:11:30,201 --> 00:11:33,210
experiment and they're
in the museum board.

180
00:11:33,211 --> 00:11:37,610
Hava in Leiden now [inaudible] now
look at these things and see if you can

181
00:11:37,611 --> 00:11:38,900
figure out what some of them are.

182
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:43,310
Here are tetrahedral
whose faces are colored.

183
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,970
So you could make,
if you had four different colors,

184
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:51,710
that would denote being associated with
four different things and each face

185
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:54,880
would correspond to a,
okay,

186
00:11:56,110 --> 00:12:01,090
this one has colored vertices. So instead
you could use a tetrahedron. Either way,

187
00:12:01,091 --> 00:12:05,410
you could use the for the faces to denote
a neighbor or you could use the points

188
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:08,500
to note where a bond is to the neighbor.
And he did it both ways.

189
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:14,700
What are these here?
What are those models?

190
00:12:14,701 --> 00:12:19,050
Those aren't tetrahedral. Can you see
why he might've made those models?

191
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:22,973
Kevin,
what do you say?

192
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,253
Nope.

193
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:34,020
We talked about van Hoff last time.
Last lecture.

194
00:12:34,021 --> 00:12:35,460
Do you remember what he was talking about?

195
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:45,880
Lucas? Pardon me? Loddon Borg. Benzene.

196
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:49,360
A triangular prism.
That's what these are.

197
00:12:49,361 --> 00:12:54,070
And you remember this is a
one, two, three, five, four,

198
00:12:54,071 --> 00:12:57,940
six or whatever it is, right? That
are this way. If you color these too,

199
00:12:57,941 --> 00:13:02,260
it's not super imposable on one where you
call this one in this one or this case

200
00:13:02,261 --> 00:13:06,310
that was a B or a B. The other way,
those, he said we're absolutely different.

201
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:10,350
So those are models he made in with
regard to this argument with uh,

202
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,440
with Lauden board.

203
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:13,640
Yeah.

204
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:18,620
Okay. Now here are his models of these
two things you get by removing water.

205
00:13:18,621 --> 00:13:22,250
Pardon me? From, from, from tartaric acid.

206
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:25,790
So what he has is,
is Tetra heater for the carbons.

207
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:31,280
And what does he mean when he puts
their edges together like this?

208
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:37,000
What's the you as part? Pardon me?
What's he using to denote a bond?

209
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:40,943
There we go.

210
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:47,810
What's the noting of bond?
A shared Vertex,

211
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:53,420
right? So here's a single
bond, right? What's this?

212
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,470
A double bond.
That's like what Lewis did later.

213
00:13:57,471 --> 00:14:01,100
Remember when he brought cubes together
to share an edge or a little bit like

214
00:14:01,101 --> 00:14:03,290
that at least.
But now when you do that,

215
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:07,100
when you share an edge and and have
the other two things on each carbon,

216
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:10,610
they're different. This one
read and not read, right?

217
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,560
You could put them together this way,

218
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:15,410
but you could also put
them together this way

219
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:21,240
and you can't get from one to the other
without pulling them apart and putting

220
00:14:21,241 --> 00:14:23,180
them back together again.
Right?

221
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:27,260
So that would explain why there
are two different isomers Malai,

222
00:14:27,261 --> 00:14:30,350
ACC acid and fumaric acid,
right?

223
00:14:30,351 --> 00:14:35,351
That you get when you start with tartaric
acid and pull off the water or start

224
00:14:36,441 --> 00:14:39,560
with malic acid. I was saying
tartaric you start with malic acid,

225
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:43,700
pull off water and you
get either this or this.

226
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:48,230
Okay? So he could explain that
with his tetrahedral models.

227
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:52,700
The red denotes a red vertex.
Okay.

228
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:56,390
Or if you have a single bond,
you could count isomers.

229
00:14:56,391 --> 00:15:01,220
Now what he says here is you don't get
all that many isomers because it can

230
00:15:01,221 --> 00:15:05,780
freely rotate about the
bond between the two.

231
00:15:05,781 --> 00:15:10,250
So the carbon atom is in the center of
a tetrahedron and it's substituents are

232
00:15:10,251 --> 00:15:14,060
on the virtus vertices, right? So
the top carbon has three things,

233
00:15:14,061 --> 00:15:18,560
r one r two r three and what he shows
here as you can rotate that freely,

234
00:15:18,561 --> 00:15:22,250
you don't count all these as separate
isomers who would have thought you did

235
00:15:22,251 --> 00:15:23,780
count them as separate isomers.

236
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:30,520
You may not remember the
name. Where was he? What?

237
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:35,940
The guy from Palermo, right?
Paterno was his name, right?

238
00:15:35,941 --> 00:15:39,810
He tried to explain the existence of
isomers by say, but Vance Hoff says, no,

239
00:15:39,811 --> 00:15:43,440
that's not true. You can freely
rotate. So you can't count that.

240
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,060
But you could have,

241
00:15:45,061 --> 00:15:48,780
if you look down on r one r two r
three you could look down and see them

242
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:53,781
clockwise from one to two to three or
you could see the counter clockwise from

243
00:15:54,861 --> 00:15:59,200
one to two to three and you can't go
back and forth between those by rotating

244
00:15:59,201 --> 00:16:03,620
cause they're in a certain order.
So you do get a isomers.

245
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,250
So he made this diagram to show that
free rotation about the central bond

246
00:16:07,251 --> 00:16:07,850
results,

247
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:12,850
results in rapid inder conversion and
thus inseparability and the irrelevance of

248
00:16:13,101 --> 00:16:15,140
the isomers that Paterno talked about.

249
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:18,110
And they can be arranged
clockwise or counterclockwise,

250
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:23,030
which is not affected by the
rotation about the central bond. Uh,

251
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:27,290
and you can then count how many isomers
there are depending on whether r one r

252
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:30,950
two r three are the
same as a four or five,

253
00:16:30,951 --> 00:16:34,250
six or are different from
four or five. Six. Okay.

254
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:38,990
But maybe the most spectacular thing
he showed was that if you put three

255
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:42,530
tetrahedral together like that,
you get these forms,

256
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,230
which what's the relationship
between these two?

257
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:48,230
Can you super impose them and
have them be exactly the same?

258
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:49,543
Okay.

259
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,090
Is there any relationship between them?

260
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:59,630
Obviously used to just slid them together
are one would be on top of are one and

261
00:16:59,631 --> 00:17:03,620
two on two, but four and
three. But, uh, but uh,

262
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:07,340
for this is a four here,
it looks like a one,

263
00:17:07,341 --> 00:17:10,430
four and three would not be on top of
one another when you slide them together

264
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:13,700
and there's no way of twisting
it, so it'll be right. Right.

265
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:15,710
But there's a special
relationship between those.

266
00:17:15,711 --> 00:17:18,530
They're not completely unrelated.
What symmetry relates to them?

267
00:17:18,531 --> 00:17:22,970
Do you see Zach? Right. Yeah,

268
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:27,050
there are mirror images. Like
right handed and left handed. Okay.

269
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:31,280
So he predicted that if you had two
double bonds in a row with a common carbon

270
00:17:31,281 --> 00:17:32,114
in the middle,

271
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:36,440
then you could get right and left handed
where you can't get it with just the

272
00:17:36,441 --> 00:17:39,320
double bond as in the
bellyache and fumaric acid.

273
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:42,020
Those aren't chiral as we now say.

274
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:47,620
But this wasn't shown until 1935 that was
probably the longest that that there's

275
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:53,930
been a correct theory proposed until
the time that it was confirmed.

276
00:17:53,971 --> 00:17:55,770
At least I don't know of
anything longer than that.

277
00:17:56,070 --> 00:18:01,070
61 years after he predicted it before it
was demonstrated to be demonstrated to

278
00:18:01,981 --> 00:18:05,700
be true. And it was proved. You
see in the labs of a Kohler,

279
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:08,760
the same guy we talked about last time,
uh,

280
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:13,440
and here's the molecule he used down in
the bottom left and we can enlarge it

281
00:18:13,441 --> 00:18:16,230
here.
So there it is.

282
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,900
Now that molecule,

283
00:18:18,901 --> 00:18:22,560
as you look at it would be super
imposable on its mirror image.

284
00:18:22,561 --> 00:18:26,400
It looks planer right now.
Let's think about that.

285
00:18:26,401 --> 00:18:29,010
That bonds at that carbon
should be tetrahedral.

286
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,500
So one bond should be coming in and out.

287
00:18:31,501 --> 00:18:35,190
Or one pair of bonds and the other
box parabon should lie in the plane,

288
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,600
but if that's true,

289
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:41,880
then the one on the right would have
it's four bonds Co Planer, right?

290
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,290
All in the plane of the paper.

291
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,710
So there's something wrong here
and you can see what's wrong.

292
00:18:46,711 --> 00:18:50,340
If you think about the P orbitals
that go into making a double bond,

293
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,820
right?
What's wrong with that arrangement?

294
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:59,880
Why don't the P orbitals like it? There
are thug and all. They don't overlap,

295
00:18:59,881 --> 00:19:00,360
right?

296
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:05,160
What you need to do is to twist it like
that so that the groups see 10 h seven

297
00:19:05,161 --> 00:19:08,310
and c six h five come in
and out of the plane, right?

298
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:13,110
And that's what then makes it not super
imposable on its mirror image. Okay?

299
00:19:13,111 --> 00:19:18,111
Now if you wanted to convert
one mirror image to the other,

300
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:19,980
notice if you use the plane,

301
00:19:19,981 --> 00:19:22,770
is that something parallel
to the screen as a mirror?

302
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:26,580
What comes out in front of the
mirror would be the same on the left,

303
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,660
but on the right,

304
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:32,340
see 10 h seven would be back in and
c six h five would be coming out,

305
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,770
right?
So if you want to inter convert these,

306
00:19:34,771 --> 00:19:37,530
you have to put 10 where
six is and six where 10 is,

307
00:19:37,531 --> 00:19:39,150
you have to rotate around the bond.

308
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:42,960
But to do that you have to break
the bond because it's a double bond.

309
00:19:42,961 --> 00:19:46,770
You'd have to go back to where the P
orbitals don't overlap and you lose the

310
00:19:46,771 --> 00:19:51,600
double bond and then you can keep rotating
and get the other mirror image isomer.

311
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:55,800
Right? But you have to break a bond
to do that. So that's very tough.

312
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:02,490
Okay. Now we were counting isomers
in homework for today and uh,

313
00:20:02,491 --> 00:20:07,220
this, this, uh, slide goes through and
council, I'm just going to begin it, uh,

314
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:11,250
and then hustle through the end rather
than go through it in great detail

315
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:14,670
because you've already worked on it. But
this can be thought of as an answer key.

316
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:15,361
Okay.

317
00:20:15,361 --> 00:20:19,560
So we want to count how many different
Mano substituent positions there are in

318
00:20:19,561 --> 00:20:22,920
that compound. There's one. Okay.

319
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:27,480
There's obviously a different one too.
Now how about three?

320
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:30,270
Is that different if you have
just a mano substitution?

321
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:32,250
Is the blue different from their Ed know?
Obviously,

322
00:20:32,251 --> 00:20:35,280
because this thing has rotational
symmetry, you could rotate it.

323
00:20:35,281 --> 00:20:40,080
Put the red on top of the blue. So the
blues, not a new one. Forget blue. Okay.

324
00:20:40,081 --> 00:20:44,160
Now how about that blue one?
Is that a new one?

325
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:48,980
No, because the one in the left front, uh,

326
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,200
would go on that same rotation.
Go to the right rear.

327
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:57,790
So that one doesn't count. How about
that one? Is that different or the same?

328
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:04,880
Can you rotate it? So the one in the
front left becomes the one in the front,

329
00:21:04,881 --> 00:21:08,360
right? No. So now we have a question.

330
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:13,610
Is that something real about the models
or is that just like the sausages that

331
00:21:13,611 --> 00:21:17,270
calculate years that it
suggests a difference when
there's not a real difference.

332
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:22,220
Okay, so we'll put a question
mark on that one. Okay.

333
00:21:22,221 --> 00:21:27,221
So there are two isomers if we don't
count the two on the bottom and there's an

334
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:30,440
additional isomer if we do count it.
Okay.

335
00:21:30,441 --> 00:21:34,430
So they're either two isomers or
conceivably three isomers of that one.

336
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,920
Okay.
And notice that this one,

337
00:21:36,921 --> 00:21:41,720
the third one in has exactly the same
arrangement among the hydrogens is the

338
00:21:41,721 --> 00:21:42,201
first one.

339
00:21:42,201 --> 00:21:46,520
So the numbers would be the same to an
additional one if you count those extras.

340
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:51,440
Now here you have obviously
three different positions
you could have for mono,

341
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:55,130
top, middle bottom, but also, uh,

342
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:59,000
the ones on the right are not super
imposable on the ones on the left,

343
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,560
if this is three dimensional.

344
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:04,670
So you could have another three
if they count and so on. Well,

345
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,650
I'll not go through these,
uh,

346
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:11,710
notice it except to note in this one
that there's obviously top here and these

347
00:22:12,651 --> 00:22:15,320
three. Now the question is, are
those three different or not?

348
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:20,600
And were used following van off here and
saying it rotates rapidly around here.

349
00:22:20,601 --> 00:22:24,620
So on time average, you won't be able
to put those in separate bottles, right?

350
00:22:24,621 --> 00:22:28,220
They're going to inter convert to
rapidly to count. So there'll be three,

351
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,570
but the two on the top
right are not really,

352
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:37,280
they are not super imposable
by rotation in the model.

353
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:41,160
Okay? So the question is whether you
have that additional one in Brisbane,

354
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:44,960
there's only one. And then if you go die
substituted, if we start on the left,

355
00:22:44,961 --> 00:22:49,160
if you, if you, if you, uh,
start with one on the top here,

356
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:54,910
you can have the second
one here or here or here,

357
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:58,880
that's clearly three,
but there might,

358
00:22:58,881 --> 00:23:02,840
this one is not super imposable of
that is if you have this one already,

359
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:07,790
this one in this one as sites for the
secondary, not super imposable, right?

360
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:11,000
So maybe we need another one there
and another one over here as well.

361
00:23:11,001 --> 00:23:13,130
So there might be an additional two.
And again,

362
00:23:13,131 --> 00:23:16,730
this is the same as that one and you can
go through this and presumably you have

363
00:23:16,731 --> 00:23:19,250
done. But anyhow, these
are the answers I got.

364
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,710
And if you found something different,
let me know.

365
00:23:21,711 --> 00:23:26,120
Maybe you saw something I didn't see.
Okay, so that's interesting. Now,

366
00:23:26,121 --> 00:23:30,980
mirror images. Here's me with
a mirror image. Right now,

367
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:32,720
this is a question.
Uh,

368
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:36,440
why does the mirror
exchange right and left,

369
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:39,350
but it doesn't exchange top and bottom?

370
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:42,620
How does the Mirror knows
which way gravity points?

371
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:50,220
Or how about if I lay on my slide on
my side, when I looked in the mirror,

372
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:54,570
would it still exchange left and
right and not top and bottom?

373
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:58,530
I'm talking about plane mirrors,
not fun house mirrors.

374
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:02,280
That's an interesting problem,
right?

375
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:09,670
But notice it doesn't change either
cause top is on top and write is on,

376
00:24:10,671 --> 00:24:15,260
right? It didn't change. Right
and left it left. Right on.

377
00:24:15,261 --> 00:24:17,570
Right.
What did it change?

378
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:22,850
Why does the mirror image look
different from the real image?

379
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:26,720
If it doesn't change right and left
and it doesn't change top and bottom,

380
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:31,160
it changes front to back or in and out.
Right?

381
00:24:31,161 --> 00:24:35,210
Because my original self, you see the
back of my head and then the mirror image,

382
00:24:35,211 --> 00:24:39,950
you see the front of me.
So what a mirror changes is in and out.

383
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:43,880
Not right and left.
Okay.

384
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:50,320
But our intuition interprets that as
rotation because if I look like this and I

385
00:24:52,431 --> 00:24:54,620
go like this,
right?

386
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:58,940
You expect it to change the right hand
because you're accustomed to people

387
00:24:58,941 --> 00:24:59,774
rotating.

388
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:04,430
You're not expected me to go like
that and turn it inside out. Right.

389
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,020
Okay. So people don't invert. So our,

390
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:15,070
our mind makes us think that the person
we see in the mirror has turned 180

391
00:25:15,441 --> 00:25:19,730
degrees so that the right
should be on the left. Okay.

392
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:21,830
And then of course you,
this was,

393
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:25,520
this is not a new observation
through the looking glass, you know,

394
00:25:25,521 --> 00:25:28,490
Lewis Carroll and Alice
going through and here's,

395
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:30,800
here are successive pictures in that book.

396
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:36,070
There she is looking into the glass and
we turn the page and here she is coming

397
00:25:37,701 --> 00:25:41,480
out on the other side.
Now notice something about this.

398
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:43,580
That's her right arm.

399
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,410
All right?
Okay.

400
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:52,660
And in the previous picture
it was also her right arm.

401
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:56,820
That's not the way the
mirror image should look.

402
00:25:57,870 --> 00:26:01,710
It should have changed the way it
looks when you go from back to front.

403
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:06,030
Okay. Now, Lewis Carroll was a smart guy.

404
00:26:06,031 --> 00:26:10,860
He taught mathematics at
Oxford. Right? Of course,

405
00:26:10,861 --> 00:26:12,060
he didn't draw the picture.

406
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:17,540
The picture was drawn by John Tenniel
and it turned out that John Tenniel was

407
00:26:17,611 --> 00:26:19,200
blind in one eye.

408
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:23,520
A fact I only discovered
yesterday on Wikipedia.

409
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:30,950
So is that the reason that he's unable
to perceive depth and draws the wrong

410
00:26:32,221 --> 00:26:36,490
thing?
No,

411
00:26:36,491 --> 00:26:37,780
it's much more subtle than that.

412
00:26:37,781 --> 00:26:41,830
Notice that the name of the book
is through the looking glass.

413
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:46,800
She moved through the looking glass
and her right arm stayed right,

414
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,300
but if she had been reflected
in the looking glass,

415
00:26:51,301 --> 00:26:55,500
if the title had been chosen to be in
the looking glass rather than through the

416
00:26:55,501 --> 00:26:58,590
looking glass,
then when you looked at the mirror image,

417
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:01,560
it would have been the left arm.
That's sort of cute.

418
00:27:01,561 --> 00:27:04,650
So Carol is more subtle than
you might give him credit for,

419
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,740
or John Tannehill or both.
Okay.

420
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,990
Or look even further in the book.

421
00:27:09,991 --> 00:27:14,991
This was notice 1872 what was going
on in chemistry in 1872 these visceral

422
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:21,030
Zeno's news was studying
these isomers of lactic acid.

423
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:25,200
The Shayla and the levy can showing
that they had the same constitution,

424
00:27:25,201 --> 00:27:27,390
but we're different.
Okay,

425
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:30,480
so look what happens here when
she's talking to her kitty.

426
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:33,210
Now if you'll only attend
kitty and not talk so much,

427
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:37,020
I'll tell you all my ideas
about looking glass house.

428
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:41,580
Well then the books or something like our
books, only the words go the wrong way.

429
00:27:41,581 --> 00:27:45,960
I know that because I've held up one
of our books to the glass and then they

430
00:27:45,961 --> 00:27:47,580
hold up the one in the other room.

431
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:51,000
How would you like to live in
a looking glass house? Kitty?

432
00:27:51,001 --> 00:27:53,340
I wonder if they give you milk.
They're

433
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:58,560
perhaps looking glass
milk isn't good to drink

434
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,270
because in the college,
uh,

435
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:08,450
Carol knew Vernon Harcort who was a
chemist who was involved in this work with

436
00:28:09,241 --> 00:28:13,770
this Luiseno who's so almost certainly
they'd had conversations about lactic

437
00:28:13,771 --> 00:28:18,300
acid, the mirror image form, right? So
there's a lot of stuff in the Alice.

438
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:22,680
So where's he referring
maybe to sarco lactic acid,

439
00:28:22,681 --> 00:28:27,060
the one that comes from meat
instead of from sour milk. Anyhow,

440
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:31,530
Kyra [inaudible] comes from the
Greek word hair, which means hand.

441
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:34,620
It's handedness.
So there's a right hand.

442
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:39,630
Now let's talk about that. And Lord
Kelvin coined the word. He said,

443
00:28:39,631 --> 00:28:44,631
I call any geometric figure or group
of points chiral and say it has Kyra

444
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:49,320
Allity. If its image in a
plain mirror, ideally realized,

445
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:51,840
so don't take into
account, you know, uh, uh,

446
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:55,770
moles or a fingernail that hasn't
been trimmed or something like that.

447
00:28:56,010 --> 00:29:01,010
Ideally realized cannot be brought to
coincide with itself by rotation and so

448
00:29:01,561 --> 00:29:05,940
on. Okay, so let's consider
Xyz coordinate system.

449
00:29:05,941 --> 00:29:10,500
So they're coordinating their points for
every every cert point on the surface

450
00:29:10,501 --> 00:29:12,120
of the hand.

451
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:16,980
And I could make an image
of it by changing some of
the signs of some of these

452
00:29:16,981 --> 00:29:18,000
things.
For example,

453
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:22,320
I could leave all the Z and
y coordinates identical,

454
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:25,590
but change the sign of x,

455
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:29,100
which would move things from being
on that side to being on this side.

456
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:32,550
You got the idea?
Okay,

457
00:29:32,551 --> 00:29:36,750
so I'm gonna make a new hand that looks
like the original one except every x

458
00:29:36,751 --> 00:29:41,590
coordinate has changed at sign change
all the x coordinates and we get that.

459
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:46,150
Everyone see it ideally realize the
shadows a little different and so on.

460
00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:50,950
But ideally realize those are the, those
are the ones that have done that, right?

461
00:29:50,951 --> 00:29:54,400
Changed one sign.
Now is one hand right?

462
00:29:54,401 --> 00:29:58,180
On the other hand left or are they both?
Right.

463
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:02,243
Okay.

464
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:03,963
So what,

465
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:08,260
what kind of relationship would
you say there is between these?

466
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:14,040
Are they super imposable or are they
non superimposable mirror images.

467
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,633
Okay.

468
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:20,130
Can you rotate and put one on top?
Exactly the coincide or the other doe.

469
00:30:20,131 --> 00:30:21,690
Because there are right
hand on the left hand.

470
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:27,080
But that operation chorus changing the
sine of x corresponds to reflecting in a

471
00:30:29,221 --> 00:30:32,850
mirror,
which is y z in the Y Z plane.

472
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:38,010
Everybody got it leaves y and z.
That's like leaving top, top and right.

473
00:30:38,011 --> 00:30:42,390
Right. But changing in and out
this way. Okay, so that's a mirror.

474
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:47,690
Now what would happen if we changed all
the y coordinates and you see but left x

475
00:30:49,351 --> 00:30:50,280
and z the same.

476
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:58,080
Then you'd get this.
Okay.

477
00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:01,690
And what does that correspond to?

478
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:05,050
Is that a rotation or a mirror

479
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:13,840
if your left
hand.

480
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:17,800
So they both left hands.
This one,

481
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:23,050
right? And this is a right hand
and suddenly not a left hand.

482
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:28,000
And if I rotated that would look like
that. Right? Is that the way it looks now?

483
00:31:28,001 --> 00:31:32,770
It looks like that. Right? So what
was the operation that did that?

484
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,720
Mathematically it's changing the sign,

485
00:31:34,721 --> 00:31:39,040
but how would you describe it in
terms of mirrors and things like that?

486
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:45,570
It's a horizontal mirror that
leaves right left in out the same.

487
00:31:46,331 --> 00:31:50,950
But changes up down top, bottom. Okay,
so that's reflection and an x, z beer.

488
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:54,340
Now suppose we change the
sign of all the z coordinates.

489
00:31:54,341 --> 00:31:55,660
Can you guess what that's going to do?

490
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:02,610
Not Rotation.
Change the sign of z.

491
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:08,610
So that's going to give that one
change in and out. But leave right,

492
00:32:08,611 --> 00:32:12,600
left and back for a DA.
Back Change.

493
00:32:12,601 --> 00:32:17,490
Right left and top box. Pardon
me? Leave right, left. Leave top.

494
00:32:17,491 --> 00:32:22,290
Bottom. But changing out. That
gives the one in front. This one,

495
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:26,460
right? Okay, so that's the
reflection in the x, y mirror.

496
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:31,890
Now there's some there. We've
occupied now four of the [inaudible],

497
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:35,760
but we can occupy the other four as well.
For example,

498
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:40,340
we can change the sign of all x and Y,
but leaves z the same.

499
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:45,410
Can you see what that's got to do?
Change acts.

500
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:48,680
Change y but z the same.

501
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:50,953
Okay.

502
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,990
There. And what operation
was that? Was that a mirror

503
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:03,760
rotation? About what? About z?

504
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:07,140
The one that didn't change.
Right? How about if we,

505
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:11,070
that's rotation around the Z axis.
How about if we change all the and zs,

506
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:13,800
but leave. Why the same?
What's that? Got To do.

507
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:17,070
That's easy once you know the previous one

508
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:24,980
that's going to rotate about the y axis.
Right?

509
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:29,630
And how about if we change the sign
of y and Z and leave x the same.

510
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:36,210
Sophie,
do you see?

511
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:40,800
So we're going to change the sign of
why and change the sign of Zhi from the

512
00:33:40,801 --> 00:33:44,520
original one back here.
We're going to change why?

513
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:49,680
Up and down and we're
going to change, uh, z.

514
00:33:49,681 --> 00:33:52,800
Did I say? Yeah, Z in
and out from this one.

515
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:02,200
Does that one.
All right.

516
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:08,710
That changes in and out and
it changes up and down. Right?

517
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:11,950
And what it is is rotation
around the x axis.

518
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:17,830
Now there's one up [inaudible]
that hasn't been occupied yet.

519
00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:21,340
The the one that's out front,
top left.

520
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,550
Can you see how you get there?
What haven't we done yet?

521
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:33,150
If you change all three x and y and Z,

522
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:39,110
then you come up there and
get the eighth one. Okay.

523
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:41,190
Now what operation is that?

524
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:46,860
It's in version through
the center of symmetry.

525
00:34:46,890 --> 00:34:51,540
It's what I tried to do bikes like that,
but I couldn't change myself inside out.

526
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:52,403
Right?

527
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:58,100
So there's the center of symmetry there
and every point on the back has has one

528
00:34:58,831 --> 00:35:03,600
the same distance and along the same
vector to the front right there or to the

529
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:07,770
base of my thumb. Okay, so here there are,

530
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:11,580
we looked at three mirrors,
three rotations and an inversion.

531
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:16,200
Some of them changed right to
left and some of them didn't.

532
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:19,380
Some of them were super imposable.
Right?

533
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:22,860
Can you see in terms of changing signs,

534
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:27,600
what determines whether it's going to
be the same high end or the other hand?

535
00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:30,120
Angela reflection.

536
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:35,700
The reflection changes hands.
So if you change x or y or Z,

537
00:35:35,701 --> 00:35:37,110
any other way to change hands

538
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:44,490
if you change everything x and y and z.
So if you change an odd number,

539
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:47,250
then you change the hand.

540
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:49,463
Okay.

541
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:55,730
So Kyra [inaudible] handedness is non
super imposable mirror images and it

542
00:35:56,371 --> 00:35:59,460
involves an odd number of
changes of coordinates.

543
00:35:59,461 --> 00:36:03,030
Now notice the right hand
has only one mirror image,

544
00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:05,730
the right and the left are
mirror images of one another.

545
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:10,650
I can put the mirror image here or I can
put it here or I can put it here, right?

546
00:36:10,651 --> 00:36:15,270
So which mirror I use determines
where the new hand is going to be.

547
00:36:15,271 --> 00:36:19,890
But it's always the same
mirror image. Okay. Uh,

548
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,860
just generates it in different
locations in orientations.

549
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:29,730
Now this is a special property
handedness, right? Or is it,

550
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:33,720
is it an everyday property?
Right. We've looked at molecules.

551
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:37,190
Van Hoff was able to come
up with a what about, uh,

552
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:40,800
less than a dozen examples from all the
molecules that have been known up to

553
00:36:40,801 --> 00:36:44,310
that time.
So what do you think,

554
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:49,340
do you think most molecules are chiral
or do you think most organic molecules

555
00:36:50,641 --> 00:36:54,300
are not? Chiral? Uh, well,

556
00:36:54,301 --> 00:36:59,301
we had an exciting night last night and
learned about the democratic process.

557
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:04,590
So the way to settle such a
question is to vote. Okay,

558
00:37:04,591 --> 00:37:09,300
so how many, we're going to vote
on how specialists Chi rally first.

559
00:37:09,301 --> 00:37:12,600
Very special, right? Only
unusual molecules will have it.

560
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:14,400
Or on the other hand,

561
00:37:14,401 --> 00:37:17,880
you're like these carbons that have
four different things or alternative.

562
00:37:17,881 --> 00:37:21,960
It's very general. And what's
unusual is ones that are a chiral,

563
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,090
not like hands.
So here we go.

564
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:27,600
How many people think that
[inaudible] is pretty special?

565
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,820
Okay.
Be a little like Indiana.

566
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:37,810
How many people think corralled
is not so special? Oh,

567
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:41,860
not very many. That's what I
anticipated. It's pretty special.

568
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:46,270
The class voted overwhelmingly.
There should be more keyer.

569
00:37:46,271 --> 00:37:51,271
A keyer all didn't chiral molecules and
the voice of the people is the voice of

570
00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:54,080
God.
All right,

571
00:37:56,540 --> 00:38:00,230
so let's look at words. You
can use words. Alice said,

572
00:38:00,231 --> 00:38:03,770
hold up or book to a mirror.
Okay, so here's a message.

573
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:07,910
Let's decode at noon,
but keep it mom. Okay,

574
00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:11,870
now let's make the uh,
change the sine of x.

575
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:16,910
So we get the mirror image of
this. Okay. It looks like nonsense.

576
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:21,020
Is there anything special
mum?

577
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:27,050
Mum is its own mirror image.
Thus it's not handed.

578
00:38:27,051 --> 00:38:29,630
It's a chiral.
Right?

579
00:38:29,631 --> 00:38:33,480
But it's the only word that has that.
When you change the sign of x,

580
00:38:33,481 --> 00:38:37,480
it stays the same. It's pretty special
to be a chiral. There'll be mom at least.

581
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:40,450
Okay, here. Now, any other
words look interesting?

582
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:47,150
No one looks sort of interesting.
Is it super imposable on its mirror image?

583
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:52,730
No. [inaudible] so it's chiral
handed. Like most words.

584
00:38:52,731 --> 00:38:56,060
You can have a right or a left handed
noon. It does have symmetry though.

585
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:59,360
Watch what happens if we instead
of do use it in a mirror,

586
00:38:59,361 --> 00:39:04,310
rotate the message on the right.
So change both x and y.

587
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:09,580
And now you notice what
noon is the same.

588
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:15,010
So it has symmetry, it has
rotational symmetry, right?

589
00:39:15,011 --> 00:39:19,150
But not mirror. Okay. In two dimensions.

590
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:21,040
So it has rotational sim do that,

591
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:25,000
but that doesn't keep it from being
chiral like a propeller is Kyrell.

592
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:31,750
It has rotational symmetry. Okay. Now
let's mirror by changing the sign of why

593
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,680
anything special here.

594
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,030
What do you do that

595
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:41,410
decode is the same.

596
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:43,493
Okay,

597
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:48,380
so decode is a measle word,
right?

598
00:39:48,381 --> 00:39:51,440
It's a chiral.
Uh,

599
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:54,770
but it's harder to recognize because
we're not accustomed to dealing with

600
00:39:54,771 --> 00:39:56,150
mirrors that are horizontal.

601
00:39:56,151 --> 00:39:58,230
We're much more familiar with
mirrors that are vertical.

602
00:39:58,231 --> 00:40:01,940
So it's much easier to see it
in mom than to see it in d code.

603
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:06,740
So you can amaze your roommates with that.
Okay.

604
00:40:06,741 --> 00:40:10,700
So how specialists carnality
in the case of words,

605
00:40:10,730 --> 00:40:15,470
it's not at all special, right?
What's special is to be a chiral,

606
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:19,790
to have some kind of special symmetry.
Almost all words are Chiral,

607
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:24,110
but there are certain a chiral or
Misa words such as mom and decode,

608
00:40:24,111 --> 00:40:28,490
but they're very rare. Okay?
That's the same with molecules.

609
00:40:28,491 --> 00:40:33,170
Almost all molecules are chiral.
But if you work with very,

610
00:40:33,171 --> 00:40:37,160
very simple ones as you do
when you begin to do chemistry,

611
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:42,350
then a lot of them are a chiral.
But it's a very atypical example.

612
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:46,880
Essentially every
molecule in you is chiral.

613
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:50,750
All your amino acids, all the sugars,
everything. Almost everything.

614
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:55,880
Fatty acids aren't Chiral, but when
there are parts of fats, they are Kyrell.

615
00:40:57,030 --> 00:40:57,863
Okay,

616
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:01,260
but why did we deal with
very simple molecules?

617
00:41:01,261 --> 00:41:04,020
We often encounter a chiral are Misa ones.

618
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:09,270
Now we're going to go beyond
constitution into Stereo Chemistry.

619
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:13,170
So we've talked about composition,
we've talked about constitution,

620
00:41:13,171 --> 00:41:14,790
the nature and sequence of bonds,

621
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:20,280
and now we're going to go
into configuration and con
formation. The other two CS,

622
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:24,420
these last three C's all
have to do with isomers,

623
00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:26,790
but there's a difference in that.

624
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:30,090
The last two have to do
with arrangement in space.

625
00:41:30,450 --> 00:41:35,450
What the traditional chemists warn the
young folks not to think about at in the

626
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:38,750
third quarter.

627
00:41:38,751 --> 00:41:43,751
The of and early fourth quarter of the
19th century and what the encyclopedia

628
00:41:43,881 --> 00:41:47,870
Britannica still didn't
know about by 1911. Okay.

629
00:41:48,290 --> 00:41:51,380
But what's the difference between
configuration and confirmation?

630
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:55,340
The distinction is based on
the model we make, right?

631
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,360
And uh,

632
00:41:57,410 --> 00:42:01,550
because configurational
isomers relate to one another.

633
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:03,620
By breaking a bond,

634
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:07,580
you have to break a bond to go from one
to the other and reassemble the pieces,

635
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:10,790
right? But when you're
talking about Khan formation,

636
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,700
you can do it by rotating
from one to the other.

637
00:42:13,701 --> 00:42:18,020
So Paterno was talking about
isomers that related by rotation.

638
00:42:18,021 --> 00:42:22,490
His particular ones rotate so easily
that it's very hard to see different

639
00:42:22,491 --> 00:42:24,680
isomers in his case.
Right?

640
00:42:24,681 --> 00:42:27,980
Although you can get information
about that kind of thing, right.

641
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:32,300
But the ones that require breaking
a bond to go from one to the other,

642
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:35,600
those are much more easier to deal with.
Right.

643
00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:39,200
And so we have different names for them,
but it relates only to the,

644
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:40,700
to the model.

645
00:42:40,701 --> 00:42:45,701
We use that talking about
bonds that whether you break
them or not and you won't

646
00:42:46,611 --> 00:42:50,570
be surprised to hear that there's some
bonds that are so easy to break that it's

647
00:42:50,571 --> 00:42:55,571
easier to convert those configurational
isomers than it is to convert certain

648
00:42:56,361 --> 00:43:00,620
conformational isomers where formerly all
you have to do is rotate about a bond,

649
00:43:00,621 --> 00:43:04,070
but in the process other things run into
one another and make it very difficult.

650
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:08,540
So it's configuration and
confirmation relates to the models.

651
00:43:08,541 --> 00:43:12,440
We draw the molecules not to something
the molecule itself fundamentally knows

652
00:43:12,441 --> 00:43:17,360
about. So that one's hard to get back
and forth and that one's easy typically,

653
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:20,960
but it doesn't have to be that way.
Okay,

654
00:43:21,290 --> 00:43:24,770
so all isomers represent
local energy minimum.

655
00:43:24,890 --> 00:43:26,530
That is if you are a
low enough temperature,

656
00:43:26,550 --> 00:43:29,600
the molecule could sit in that
structure and just vibrate,

657
00:43:29,601 --> 00:43:33,740
have had zero point amplitude of vibration
around that particular structure.

658
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:35,840
But then you can get from one to another.

659
00:43:35,841 --> 00:43:40,830
You don't take every possible structure
as Paterno tried to do and say that all

660
00:43:40,831 --> 00:43:44,750
of these structures are isomers because
then there'd be an infinite number and

661
00:43:44,751 --> 00:43:47,420
they wouldn't last any time
cause they're always vibrating.

662
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:51,950
But you can vibrate within a little well
here or a little well here or a little

663
00:43:51,951 --> 00:43:53,900
well here.
And those are different isomers,

664
00:43:54,410 --> 00:43:56,420
not just different phases of vibration.

665
00:43:56,420 --> 00:44:01,130
Now the words of stereochemistry
often involve relationships.

666
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:06,230
For example, two molecules that
have exactly the same constitution,

667
00:44:06,231 --> 00:44:09,950
nature and sequence of bonds
can be identical. Okay?

668
00:44:09,951 --> 00:44:13,550
They're super imposable and if
you wanted the name for that,

669
00:44:13,551 --> 00:44:18,020
you would call them home omers but no
one needs to use that because it's always

670
00:44:18,021 --> 00:44:21,590
the same thing.
So that word doesn't really exist.

671
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:24,410
But if they're just completely different,

672
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:28,250
then you call them Daya Stereo Merz,

673
00:44:28,310 --> 00:44:31,010
which has the same root as diameter.

674
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:34,650
Things that are as far apart as you can
get right there just playing different.

675
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:39,210
Those are Daya, Steria, Mers, but
they have the same constitution,

676
00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:41,550
the same nature and sequence of bonds,

677
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:44,730
but they're just completely different
in their arrangement in space.

678
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:48,810
Or there can be a very special relation
in space. You know what that is?

679
00:44:50,670 --> 00:44:54,030
They could be mirror images,
which are not the same thing,

680
00:44:54,450 --> 00:44:57,900
but they're going to be very
similar in many respects, right?

681
00:44:58,170 --> 00:45:01,980
So that one has a special name.
Dietary fiber just means different.

682
00:45:02,310 --> 00:45:06,240
But Ian Anti Omer Means Mirror image,

683
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:07,573
right?

684
00:45:10,030 --> 00:45:13,360
Okay. So these are relationships
between two molecules.

685
00:45:13,361 --> 00:45:18,100
You say this molecule is the
Ian Anti Omer of this molecule.

686
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:21,460
Okay?
Now

687
00:45:21,870 --> 00:45:23,670
we need to talk about things like this.

688
00:45:23,671 --> 00:45:26,730
As Lovaza ta ta told us we
need to think about the facts,

689
00:45:27,090 --> 00:45:29,850
the ideas and the words.
And when we come to words,

690
00:45:30,150 --> 00:45:34,260
now we need to convey such
complicated ideas. We need pictures,

691
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:38,640
not just written letters.
Okay?

692
00:45:38,641 --> 00:45:43,641
So we need pictures for our notation
that will show this third dimension.

693
00:45:44,221 --> 00:45:48,600
Now there are a number of tricks you
can use to do that. Uh, what's the,

694
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:52,190
can you see what's being used here
in this particular picture of it,

695
00:45:52,210 --> 00:45:53,940
which is an old fashioned picture.

696
00:45:53,941 --> 00:45:58,941
When a laptop computers were new
and you had very simple programs.

697
00:45:58,951 --> 00:45:59,784
Yeah,

698
00:46:01,030 --> 00:46:01,863
I can't hear

699
00:46:02,810 --> 00:46:07,030
relative size is one. Right. The, the
hydrogens that are far back our small.

700
00:46:07,330 --> 00:46:08,680
Anything else?
Any other

701
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:13,790
clues that show the three dimensions?
Yeah.

702
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:15,493
Can't hear very well.

703
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:18,070
No.
The lines for the bonds,

704
00:46:18,071 --> 00:46:21,670
they're thinner in the back and notice
that some of them are wedges showing that

705
00:46:21,671 --> 00:46:24,700
they're coming in and out.
Anything else?

706
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:26,753
Corey,

707
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,620
how do you know whether they're
in the front of the back?

708
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:40,290
Like this one?
How do you know it's in front of this one?

709
00:46:42,030 --> 00:46:42,863
Because it hides it

710
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,030
right?
That's a way you can do.

711
00:46:45,031 --> 00:46:48,880
You can tell there's another one which
is if you look at this one with the left

712
00:46:48,881 --> 00:46:50,710
eye and that one with the right eye,

713
00:46:51,370 --> 00:46:54,500
your brain is able to put it
together in three dimensions,

714
00:46:54,501 --> 00:46:55,630
so it'll be hard for you to do.

715
00:46:55,631 --> 00:46:59,560
I don't expect you to do you usually
use glasses to do that. Okay.

716
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:02,740
But you can see that there are different.
Look at this hydrogen here.

717
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:06,700
There you see the bond and there it's
being a little bit obscured, right?

718
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:10,380
So there are different images
that your right and left IC.

719
00:47:10,450 --> 00:47:14,020
That's why a 10 year old might have
had trouble with the third dimension.

720
00:47:14,690 --> 00:47:19,260
Okay? Uh, now, uh,

721
00:47:20,570 --> 00:47:22,460
there's another way which is motion.

722
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:28,190
So here's a complicated picture, right?
It's hard to tell what's in and out,

723
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:31,330
but I grab it and do this.

724
00:47:32,890 --> 00:47:37,420
Then you can perceive what's
in and what's out, right?

725
00:47:37,421 --> 00:47:40,720
So if you have a picture that moves,
which didn't use to be possible of course,

726
00:47:40,721 --> 00:47:45,190
until you had computers that could do
this kind of thing. So that's another way,

727
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:48,640
uh, uh, uh, motion.

728
00:47:50,870 --> 00:47:53,500
Uh, there's that same
molecule. There are other ways,

729
00:47:53,501 --> 00:47:56,020
like what's new in this one?

730
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:01,510
Shadows, right? Or here,

731
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:06,970
more obscuring and shadowing of
the balls or here, even better,

732
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:10,630
right? Depending on what you want
to show. So there are lots of,

733
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:15,340
of conventions or tricks that are used to,
to convey the third dimension.

734
00:48:15,850 --> 00:48:17,710
Uh,
okay.

735
00:48:17,711 --> 00:48:22,150
And next time we'll go on to to simple
notation that you can write on an exam,

736
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:25,360
like showing tetrahedral carbons.
Okay.
