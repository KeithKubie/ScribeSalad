00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.520
We're going to do a silly one today, we're going to talk about a special number.

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.620
We like doing videos about special numbers and we're gonna do a prime! Because we do love our prime numbers as well.

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:12.000
It's quite a big prime number. So I'm gonna write it out. So it's going to start:

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.540
357 sextillion

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.160
So it's already going to be big.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.380
686 quintillion

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.900
312 quadrillion

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.680
646 trillion

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.680
216 billion

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.860
567 million

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.840
629 thousand

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.540
one-hundred and thirty-seven.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:43.720
So it's a massive 24-digit prime number, but this is why it's special:

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:50.189
Because if I remove the first digit, the three, from that number

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.440
the remaining number here, starting with the five, is also a prime number.

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.920
And if I do that again, if I remove the five,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.720
the remaining number starting with the seven is also a prime number.

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.980
And that will be true all the way down.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.060
So up to here

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.980
629 thousand one-hundred thirty-seven is a prime number.

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:11.100
I can remove the digit.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.840
The next number will be prime, all the way down to seven.

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.720
So it's always prime when I truncate from the left,

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.180
so it's called a left-truncatable prime.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.880
And there are finitely many of them, and that is the largest one.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.000
And I learned this from my friend Rob Eastaway, who has been on Numberphile

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:37.320
He's a mathematician as well, and he gave me this pencil with the number written on it

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.240
There is the number printed on the pencil. So no matter how much I sharpen this pencil

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:47.970
I'm always going to have a prime number, which I think it's why it's written on the other side of this pencil

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.540
There you go. "Always in our prime."

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:51.740
It's a kind of a joke.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:52.900
Kind of a joke.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.000
So this is a left-truncatable prime.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.760
Let me show you how you can create them, 'cause they're not that hard to create.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.440
So let's start with the last digit.

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:04.480
So the last digit could be,

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:11.860
You know. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 or 9.

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.400
My last digit could be any of these numbers, but it has to be prime as well

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.660
'cause I want a prime at the end.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.600
So One is not a prime.

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.560
Two, we could have a prime Two at the end,

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.880
But that's not going to be able to be extended very much.

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.120
We could have Three as a prime number at the end, Four we're not gonna have at the end.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.120
Five could be at the end. Six, no, not a prime.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:32.200
Seven, maybe.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.840
Eight, not a prime, and Nine is not a prime.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.429
So it's going to have to end with one of these numbers, but let's just try now to extend it back.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.550
So we're going to extend it back to the left and make a two-digit number

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:45.960
Let's go with the seven

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.799
Okay, let's make a chain here. Let's go from the seven

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.649
Well, then if I extend it, it's going to be either 17 or 27 or 37...

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.879
47 or 57 or 67 or 77...

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.180
or 87 or 97, so which of these are prime?

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.500
17 is a prime.

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:06.860
27, that's not prime.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:08.700
37 is prime

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.560
47 is prime

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:11.980
57 is not

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:13.780
67 is prime.

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.420
77, that's not a prime.

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.340
87 is not a prime, 97 is a prime.

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.380
So let me just do a couple more steps,

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.340
let's go from the 47 and extend that further back.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.480
147 perhaps, or 247...

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:34.540
347, 947... And we keep extending this if we want, let's find a prime on that list.

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.820
So, 947 is a prime. I'll go and extend that back another step.

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:45.140
So this could be 1947 perhaps, or 2947...

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.400
Or 9947.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.060
I'm gonna extend another step here. I'm gonna go from this number,

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.860
I know this is a prime. So I'm going to go from here next,

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.220
try and extend that back, just do another step

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.580
So this is 3947, three thousand nine hundred and forty-seven

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.960
so that could now be 13947

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.240
or 23947

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.540
...93947.

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:16.460
And I'm going to stop at this step because if we do the checking through

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:18.230
None of these are prime

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:23.420
This 13947 is not a prime, 23947 is not a prime,

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.920
33947, not a prime

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.840
Not a prime.

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:32.120
None of these are primes. So the chain stopped. The chain is terminated.

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:37.300
So the last prime we had there in that chain was 3947.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.660
So that's the end point for the chain that we had

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.440
The number of endpoints that you can make just doing this kind of method

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:49.489
There's 1442 of these endpoints.

00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:51.180
So,

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.420
those are going to be the largest prime in the chain

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:00.460
And the largest one of them is this 24 digit number I've written out, but clearly you can see

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:07.009
there are only finitely many, because once you get to an end point, they can't be extended any further to the left.

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:13.849
So that's left-truncatable primes. Shall we do right-truncatable? Just to show you the largest one that's possible.

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:16.060
I'll show you the largest right-truncatable  prime so this is just a bit of fun really so it's a silly thing

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.880
So this is just a bit of fun, really. It's a silly thing, I know.

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.700
However, if I used a different base, 'cause this is a base 10 thing,

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:24.889
I use a different base,

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:29.900
If I used a larger base - base twelve, or base 20 or base 100 or something like that

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:33.400
then each step here would have longer lists.

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:37.279
And if the list is longer, then they're more likely to hit a prime

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.149
So you're going to end up with longer chains, you actually end up with bigger

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:46.309
left-truncatable primes, if you do it in a different base or a larger base.

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:50.620
For right-truncatable primes, the biggest one we have is

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.700
73 million

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:56.140
939 thousand

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:58.300
one hundred and thirty-three.

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:01.880
So now if I start removing digits from the right-hand side

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:06.460
we will always have a prime. If I allowed One to be a prime,

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.200
we could have a larger number.

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:09.720
We could have this number:

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:10.740
One billion

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.100
979 million

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:15.740
339 thousand

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:17.700
three hundred and thirty-nine.

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:23.179
So this is a prime number, and if we remove digits from the right, we always have a prime number.

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:28.070
But we end up with One and One isn't a prime number. So I don't know why I even mentioned it.

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:33.469
Let's have a look at left- AND right-truncatable primes. Is there a prime that's on both lists?

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:34.800
And yes, there is.

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.560
That's the largest one of those that we can find:

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:38.640
739 thousand

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:40.500
three hundred and ninety-seven.

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:45.640
So that is left-truncatable and it's right-truncatable, so it's on both the lists.

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:49.200
Although we... I don't think we can truncate simultaneously

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:51.840
because we're not going to get prime numbers if we do that.

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:53.940
BRADY: What's the longest you can do simultaneously?

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:55.340
DR. GRIME: Well, I...

00:06:55.500 --> 00:07:01.880
That is an interesting question, because what about if we can remove the digits in any order we want?

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:06.940
415 thousand six hundred and seventy-three.

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:12.100
And I'm gonna delete not just from the ends. I'm going to delete the One.

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:14.120
There, it's gone.

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:19.260
So I've got this number now: 45 thousand six hundred and seventy-three, and that's a prime number.

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:22.400
Now I'm going to delete another digit. I will delete the Three for this one.

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:26.980
So now I've got four thousand five hundred and sixty-seven

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:35.580
Now if I've got that, I'm gonna delete the Five in this case to get four hundred and sixty-seven, which is a prime.

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:37.400
And now I'll delete the Four

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:42.470
So to make 67, which is a prime. And now I think I'll delete the Six to get a Seven

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:48.220
So okay, I create this chain of primes, but I'm allowed to delete the digits any way I want,

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:50.860
so those are called deletable primes

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:55.880
and it is thought that there are infinitely many of those,

00:07:56.260 --> 00:08:00.180
but that is something we don't know, 'cause we haven't proven that to be true.

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:01.960
So that is a challenge.

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:07.420
BRADY: What's the number you could create a deletable prime where it doesn't matter what digit you delete,

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:09.860
any digit you delete will still leave you with a prime number?

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:12.280
DR. GRIME: That's another that's another good idea.

00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:15.240
I don't know if they exist.

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:17.660
That would be interesting to find out.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:19.040
BRADY: Get to work

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:20.560
DR. GRIME: Oh, me?

00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:23.980
BRADY: Now from past experience I can imagine some people might be thinking

00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:29.960
"What's the point of all of this? Why study these truncatable primes and deletable primes?"

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:33.619
Well first I'm not entirely sure there has to be a point.

00:08:33.719 --> 00:08:35.959
Sometimes things can just be fun

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:38.990
But I think there is a bit of a point too and let me explain

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:44.900
Studying problems like this, things from completely out of left field, make you think differently.

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:49.480
Mathematicians come up with new tools and ideas. And thinking differently,

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:53.860
Thinking about problems you don't normally think about is really good for your brain,

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:58.240
It makes you smarter. And this is where today's episode sponsor Brilliant come in.
