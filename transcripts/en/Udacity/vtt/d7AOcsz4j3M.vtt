Ainsworth used three terms to describe her attachment theories. Secure

00:00:04.456 --> 00:00:09.708
Attachment, Anxious Ambivalent Attachment and Avoidant Attachment. Given the

00:00:09.708 --> 00:00:13.700
name, what do you think an Avoidant Attachment is? Is it this one, where the

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.630
babies cry and become very distressed when the caregiver leaves? But once the

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.254
caregiver returns, gives them warm hugs, and settles down fairly quickly. Is it

00:00:23.254 --> 00:00:26.894
this one where the babies are distressed most of the time, especially when the

00:00:26.894 --> 00:00:31.442
caregiver leaves. But when the caregiver returns the baby will go to the

00:00:31.442 --> 00:00:34.675
caregiver but there won't be any warm hugs going on and the baby might even

00:00:34.675 --> 00:00:41.140
push the caregiver away. Or Babies are not distressed at any time. Not when the

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.845
caregiver leaves, not when the caregiver returns, and there's no warm hugs or

00:00:44.845 --> 00:00:50.310
affection at any time either. The caregiver is basically ignored. Give it your

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:51.709
best shot and select one.
