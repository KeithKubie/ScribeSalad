that's<00:20:18.830><c> something</c><00:20:19.130><c> that</c><00:20:19.160><c> we</c><00:20:19.520><c> really</c><00:20:19.550><c> need</c><00:20:19.940><c> to</c>

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:20.090 align:start position:0%
that's something that we really need to
 

00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:23.140 align:start position:0%
that's something that we really need to

00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:23.150 align:start position:0%
focus on and um it just so happens that
 

00:20:23.150 --> 00:20:25.240 align:start position:0%
focus on and um it just so happens that
our<00:20:23.270><c> government</c><00:20:23.750><c> is</c><00:20:23.930><c> is</c><00:20:24.290><c> focusing</c><00:20:24.890><c> on</c><00:20:24.980><c> that</c><00:20:25.130><c> as</c>

00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:25.250 align:start position:0%
our government is is focusing on that as
 

00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:29.350 align:start position:0%
our government is is focusing on that as
