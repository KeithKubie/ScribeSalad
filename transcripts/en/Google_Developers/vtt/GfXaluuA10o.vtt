00:00:06.985 --> 00:00:08.360
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
Hello and welcome

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:09.570
to "The Developer Show."

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.230
This is your TL;DR. TensorFlow
makes it possible to add

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.060
machine learning to your
app without the PhD.

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.620
And you can now
learn all about it

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:21.830
with this new Udacity course.

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.380
This is one of the
most downloaded DJ apps

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:25.320
in the world.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.100
After launching on
Android, the platform

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.610
became the largest contributor
of business growth,

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:32.830
with 50% of total
revenue and more than 70%

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:35.900
of new downloads coming
from their Android users.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.540
Find out more with this
video linked below.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.270
It's now gotten a
lot easier to share

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.560
an app's non-UI
code between iPhone,

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.860
iPod applications,
and Android and web

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.860
versions of the same app
using this new Google authored

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.660
open source compiler.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.230
Check out the blog
post for more.

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:54.930
Our good friends
over at App Annie

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.346
have launched their
2015 retrospective,

00:00:57.346 --> 00:00:59.220
looking at the key trends
from the last year,

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.910
including app monetization.

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.570
Learn the pros and cons of
different app monetization

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.070
models, how to
choose the one that's

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:07.840
right for you,
and considerations

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.490
for implementations with this
new guide from the AdMob team,

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.060
another in their no nonsense
series for developers.

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.620
We recently passed 1 million
students on the courses

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.920
we built in partnership
with Udacity.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.070
It's a great time to
join them in learning

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.030
how to use this technology to
solve the world's most pressing

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.910
challenges.

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.370
You can now use promises with
the Firebase JavaScript SDK.

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.770
Check out the blog post
for more, also linked

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.540
in the comments below.

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.932
Now that's it for the TL;DR.
You may have noticed, however,

00:01:38.932 --> 00:01:40.390
that we're out of
the studio again.

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.130
Today, we're down here at
the YouTube space in LA,

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:44.730
hanging out with
developer advocates

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:46.095
from around the world.

00:01:46.095 --> 00:01:49.210
Now, you've been active with
the hashtag #AskDevShow.

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.630
So I'm going to spend the
day interrupting advocates

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.590
with your questions.

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.430
Let's get to it.

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.930
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.430
Asking me almost anything in
the comments or on social media,

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.450
and I'll get you your answer.

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.270
Teacher Aide Pro has a question
for Mr. Todd Kerpelman,

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.680
so I'm going to ambush
Todd in the studio

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.426
before he gets
started filming today.

00:02:13.426 --> 00:02:14.800
TODD KERPELMAN:
Human torch was--

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.014
BOTH: Denied a bank loan.

00:02:16.014 --> 00:02:17.430
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
Oh, that was good.

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:18.260
It really works with
that [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.220
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah.

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.780
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Oh, hi, Todd.

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:20.220
TODD KERPELMAN: Hi, Timothy.

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.300
I didn't notice you there.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.740
TIMOTHY JORDAN: I have
a question for you.

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:23.150
TODD KERPELMAN: Let's hear it.

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.275
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Teacher
Aide Pro from the internets

00:02:25.275 --> 00:02:27.700
asked this question about the
Classroom API and the Gmail

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:28.200
API.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.380
TODD KERPELMAN: All right.

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.588
TIMOTHY JORDAN: They like
to use it in their iOS apps

00:02:30.588 --> 00:02:32.860
the way they're already
doing in their Android apps.

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.270
However, they found
that the Swift training

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:36.520
guide is a little out of date.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:37.394
TODD KERPELMAN: What?

00:02:37.394 --> 00:02:39.110
We have documentation
that's out of date?

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:40.735
All right, so Teacher
Aide Pro, there's

00:02:40.735 --> 00:02:42.370
a couple things you
should be aware of.

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.750
First of all, all of our
iOS developer guides,

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.760
look for a radio
button at the top

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.580
that lets you select between
Objective-C and Swift.

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.410
Right now, it is
defaulted to Objective-C,

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.540
and it can be sometimes easy
to miss that radio button.

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.976
So click the Swift switch
and all of your code samples

00:02:58.976 --> 00:03:00.600
and all of your
documentation will then

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:01.830
become Swift specific.

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.780
BOTH: Swift specific.

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.280
TODD KERPELMAN: So
that could be it.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.840
That said, we did
talk to the team.

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.214
They have acknowledged
that there

00:03:08.214 --> 00:03:10.059
may be some parts of
that documentation that

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:11.600
are out of date,
and they are working

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.250
on fixing it now or right

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.800
BOTH: Now.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.300
TODD KERPELMAN: But
in the meantime,

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.730
they did point out that
all the code samples should

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.290
be accurate and up to date.

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.920
So if you notice a discrepancy
between the documentation

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.980
and the code samples, go
with what's in the code.

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:25.300
Use that [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.730
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Code samples.

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:26.610
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah,
that should be good.

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.210
Well, thank you Teacher
Aide Pro for your question.

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:32.100
And if you have any other
follow-up questions, day

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.520
or night, on anything, no
matter how trivial, please just

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:36.150
call Timothy.

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.510
I'll give you his number.

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:37.860
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Thanks, Todd.

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:38.985
TODD KERPELMAN: Sure thing.

00:03:38.985 --> 00:03:40.359
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
So I just spotted

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:42.370
Mr. Ian Lake getting
his portrait taken,

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:43.775
with I think we can interrupt.

00:03:43.775 --> 00:03:44.350
Hi, Daniel.

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:45.830
DANIEL: Oh, hey, Timothy.

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:47.330
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
Hello, Mr. Ian Lake.

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.920
IAN LAKE: Hi, Timothy.

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.240
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Do you mind
if I ask you a quick question?

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.865
IAN LAKE: Sure.

00:03:49.865 --> 00:03:52.370
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So
you've asked "Dev Show"

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.460
with model-view-presenter
on Android,

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:56.690
where's the best place
to put the presenter?

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:57.336
Ian?

00:03:57.336 --> 00:03:58.710
IAN LAKE: For our
presenter, it's

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:00.880
really important that it
survives those activity

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:01.610
rotations.

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:02.050
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yes.

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.716
IAN LAKE: Right?

00:04:02.716 --> 00:04:04.370
But you don't want
it to live forever.

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:05.540
So we actually have
a class for this.

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:05.740
TIMOTHY JORDAN: OK.

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:07.310
IAN LAKE: It's called
AsyncTaskLoader.

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:08.550
TIMOTHY JORDAN: AsyncTaskLoader.

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:09.966
IAN LAKE: So it
does exactly that.

00:04:09.966 --> 00:04:12.260
It will live just long
enough, whatever your activity

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:13.302
or fragment lifecycle is.

00:04:13.302 --> 00:04:14.301
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Awesome.

00:04:14.301 --> 00:04:14.880
Thanks Ian.

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:15.810
IAN LAKE: Thanks.

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.250
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
So I spotted Rich.

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.779
He's sunbathing out here,
outside YouTube Space LA.

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:24.206
Great opportunity to ambush him
and get a little sun myself.

00:04:24.206 --> 00:04:27.062
Shh.

00:04:27.062 --> 00:04:29.918
[COUGHS]

00:04:30.434 --> 00:04:31.350
RICH HYNDMAN: [LAUGHS]

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:32.200
TIMOTHY JORDAN: How
you doing, Rich?

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.325
RICH HYNDMAN: Hey, Timothy.

00:04:33.325 --> 00:04:36.180
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So Super J
used the hashtag #AskDevShow

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.124
to ask you a question.

00:04:37.124 --> 00:04:37.832
You ready for it?

00:04:37.832 --> 00:04:39.040
RICH HYNDMAN: Go ahead.

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.346
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Who owns whom?

00:04:40.346 --> 00:04:43.380
Does Android own Google or
does Google own Android?

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:44.380
RICH HYNDMAN: Right.

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:45.520
Absolutely the latter.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.720
Android is Google's open
source mobile operating system.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.602
We acquired Android
Inc in around 2005,

00:04:50.602 --> 00:04:52.060
worked on it for
a couple of years,

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.430
and then launched the first
version of Android in 2007.

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.430
Some people thought a bit
of a risk at the time,

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:57.850
but it seems to have caught on.

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:58.995
TIMOTHY JORDAN: I
think it turned out OK.

00:04:58.995 --> 00:04:59.480
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.735
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Awesome.

00:04:59.735 --> 00:04:59.990
RICH HYNDMAN: All good?

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:01.740
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Well, get
back to your hard work.

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:02.730
RICH HYNDMAN: Thanks very much.

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:03.670
TIMOTHY JORDAN: I'll
catch you later.

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:04.610
RICH HYNDMAN: Cheers, Timothy.

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:06.110
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And
that's our show.

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:08.290
Remember to use the
hashtag #AskDevShow

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:09.730
to get your questions answered.

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:13.110
And don't forget to subscribe
to the channel for a new video

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:13.810
every week.

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:16.180
I'm Timothy Jordan, and
I'll see you next time.
