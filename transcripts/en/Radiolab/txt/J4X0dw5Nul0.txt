Speaker 1:          00:00          I'm Jad Abumrad, this is Radiolab and this is the third and final part of our series in the know about sex and consent. We started a couple of weeks ago with some excerpts from a podcast called the heart, uh, produced by Caitlin pressed. Uh, and then last week had a long, uh, at times difficult conversation with education consultant. Hanta Startland heard a bit from uh, some college age men in that episode. Uh, today?

Speaker 2:          00:23          Yes, I do have my shoes. Yes. Have you? Anyone was looking for shoes. Get comfortable. We're going to start with some college age women. If you need to stretch, you can like be like, hey, it's been too long. Like we can do yoga. No,

Speaker 1:          00:37          because what we ended up doing a sort of mid way through the process was gathering together a whole bunch of different groups of men and women, college age men and women, three different cities and just asking them general questions about how they're thinking about this stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:50          Are you excited? No. I ended up interviewing the Manson. I'll turn this part over to Becca Bressler and she [inaudible] who were with the women, the average group that we talked to was maybe a dozen women. We tried to make it as diverse as possible and then the first thing that really struck us, I think she might tell me if you agree, is there was sort of a disconnect. Like on the one hand it seemed like affirmative consent for almost everyone we talked to seemed like second nature. Yeah. So a actually teach like a workshop on consent for high schoolers. Some of them have you even teaching classes on it? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So you know like ca to, yeah. So like a clear and concise yes. At every step of sexual activity. I think that's like amazing that we're teaching kids that now and like I do feel like it's my generation's problem to change it and change the narrative about it. So a lot of them were really committed to actually changing the way consent looks, the way that these sexual experiences go and how they're navigated. But then when we would, you know, focus in on what they were actually experiencing in their lives, what we saw was much different.

Speaker 3:          02:01          It's my friend and I ended up at a bar. Um, and like the bartender was really cute and we were like flirting and he like, I don't want to give any identifying information, but we were just like vibing. And I like hooked up with him. And then like immediately after I started hooking up with him, I was like, oh, this is not what I want. But like at that point it's kind of like saying no, it would be like much more of an uncomfortable situation than just like going through with this and like understanding that I already regretted kind, I don't know,

Speaker 2:          02:25          didn't leave, but eventually I was just like, okay, fine, like whatever. Cause they would just be like, please, like, come on please. Like, you know, you're turned on a little bit like, and I'd be like, fine, whatever. Like let's find, let's fuck. And he was going down on me and like had asked me if I to have sex and I said no. And eventually like I just like kind of wanted it to be like over with like the entire interaction and I was just uncomfortable and then I was like, okay, like let's have sex just because I thought that like that was the easier way to like make him happy, make like get done with it and then like it be over. We just heard a lot of stories of people having sex that they didn't want to have. You know where maybe affirmative was in effect. They did say yes but it was either because the guy wore them down or they were way too concerned with how he was feeling

Speaker 4:          03:07          like it would make him feel really, really bad. I know that like if he would have known that I felt that way he would have gone through with it and like I just didn't want to like hurt his feelings and be like and make him feel like he like took advantage of me or whatever. When I knew that there would be no possible way that he would know that I was feeling that way.

Speaker 2:          03:23          Some women told us that they say yes sometimes when they don't want to because they're scared. Part of the fear and saying a hard no is that that hard no can then be violated and that's like, that's like a terrifying thought. Like to say like a hard no, like that's more traumatizing to me like in my head almost than having like a soft, no, just sort of like slid past having fear of future trauma. Like say it again. It's like having a fear of future trauma. Um, I take that to mean if your aim is to stay in control and you feel like you might be out of control, then the best way to still be in control is to convince yourself that you are cool with what's going on. Wow. I walked away feeling like many of the young women felt frustrated both with their world but also with themselves.

Speaker 2:          04:18          Yeah. Afterwards I would feel like very disappointed in myself because I would feel like add compromise my own needs for other people that they would walk away from a situation and they would have regretted how it went. They maybe didn't actually want to do it but didn't stick up for themselves. And then I, and then you fight like a battle with yourself cause it's like, wait a minute. Like I'm like strong. Like I know I can like just stop it or like why? But it's so hard at like in that moment to find like, I don't know like the, the words just to say it, you know, cause then it, it sometimes you're just like, yeah it is just easier just to be like let it like just like let them finish. That's it. Like it was clear for most of these women that in the moment of these encounters there were some conversation that needed to happen that was not happening. But then there actually was this one young woman that we spoke to. Some people, I think a lot of people talk about consent as if it's like awkward and weird and like, like she just said, con consent has really become popularized and is really well advocated for by the BDSM community.

Speaker 5:          05:24          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          05:24          BDSM is an abbreviation, so it, it breathes gates, bondage, discipline or domination, sadism and masochism because you constantly have to make sure that somebody is okay and be like this, this rope to tight. She told us, I mean the BDSM community has this figured out and then she started talking about her own experience. So we've started like, hmm, uh, what does that mean? That the BDSM community has figured that out?

Speaker 6:          05:48          Whoa. Hello? You got a buzz there? Oh yeah. It's like the B 52 bomber buzz. Oh, that

Speaker 3:          05:57          sounds better. All right. Okay. Hi. Hey. Good it we did it. We did it. Did you feel like, I always feel like after these technical snafoos there's like a bonding that happens. I feel bonded to you guys. Well actually it's statistically true thing that people suffering together feel bonded to one another. Well, there you go.

Speaker 7:          06:18          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          06:19          who are you by the way? What do you do? My name is Julie. I am an associate professor of sociology at Gallaudet University and I've been studying the BDSM community since about 2012

Speaker 1:          06:33          we called up Julie because she is one of the, I think it's safe to say leading academics, uh, when it comes to the BDSM community and all of its subculture. She has written papers, she has done surveys and she has done it from the inside.

Speaker 3:          06:46          A lot of kickstarters like me pretty much felt like we were sort of born this way and it's really common to talk to a lot of Kinky people who will tell you the same thing. Like I was five and fantasizing about tying up people's Genitalia and it's deep stuff, right? I didn't know what genitals were.

Speaker 1:          07:05          Anyhow, one of the things that we heard from Julie, and we subsequently heard this also from a lot of academics that we talked to after her, is it the whole consent conversation in many ways grew out of BDSM a lot. A lot of people will trace like the history of BDSM in the United States to the leatherman community. [inaudible] haven't you heard? Oh, this is a World War II era. By the way. These gay men would hang out in biker clubs at bars. They would socialize. They were a really tight knit brotherhood over the decades. The brother who grew into this much bigger community and then it really exploded in the 80s but there's a problem at the time no one had ever really formally distinguished between BDSM, a practice between willing participants and violence.

Speaker 8:          07:53          Video Sam I think had to make the case to the vanilla community to the non [inaudible] community that they were not insane but people were not getting off on hurting people. That it was about roles and role playing and power.

Speaker 1:          08:04          This is Joe for Shell. He's an associate professor of women's gender and sexuality studies at Yale Central.

Speaker 8:          08:09          The slogan to convince non people that what they were doing was not violence or crime.

Speaker 1:          08:14          The full slogan they came up with and this is in the 80s was safe, sane and consensual and it really stuck to this day. You can find it on t-shirts. You can at any of, at any BDSM community event or play party,

Speaker 3:          08:28          ah, parties that are organized at, uh, formal spaces, they're called dungeons. Right?

Speaker 1:          08:34          So getting back to Julia, we asked her, uh, okay, if it is true as that one woman said that the BDSM community, if it is true that they have figured something out about how to do it better, well what is it? And uh, she told us a couple of things. First drinking

Speaker 3:          08:50          my way of thinking that's incredibly risky, very frowned upon in the BDSM world and the video sem scene. In my mind, that's what we'd call edge play, which is like kind of the things that people do where you're like, ah, that seems like a bad idea. Negotiating sex when both people are really, really drunk with somebody that you've never met before qualifies as really, really risky.

Speaker 1:          09:08          And speaking of that negotiation. Another thing that was an interesting contrast between the quote vanilla world and BDSM is that when two people are negotiating, they're trying to figure out if are going to get down. Uh, in BDSM that conversation is formalized and it's often public

Speaker 3:          09:24          because generally speaking, most of what's happening is out in the open

Speaker 1:          09:27          these days you have people who've called consent monitors that sometimes run around these parties.

Speaker 3:          09:31          It's also not uncommon to be standing there negotiating with someone where your friend or their friend is right next to them.

Speaker 1:          09:36          The idea is that that kind of social monitoring makes things safer. Anyhow, I asked her to zoom in on a specific consent conversation. How does it usually go?

Speaker 3:          09:45          Uh, people with different experiences, levels are better and worse at this. Typically like let's say I was going to play with you, right? Like you're telling me you've never done anything like this before, right? Zero, zero. So, uh, I like to knife top, which is a way of describing the fact that I like to do things with knives on two people. Actual cutting of people or, or no, no, this is just dragging knives along people and sort of threatening with them, like playing with knives and in truth, the thing that I do to make it more interesting as I like to cut people's clothes off of them big, I teach a whole class on how to cut people's clothes off of them with knives or they are they like cerated uh, it can be, so some of them have rough edges and some of them don't.

Speaker 3:          10:30          And that's actually one of the questions I would ask you. So, um, I would ask you if you, you may be, would be more interested in sort of a poking type sensation or more of a scraping tight sensation based on just hearing that I'm gonna go with dragging. I would select my knives accordingly at that point cause I have separate knives for these purposes. Um, and then I would, if I was gonna cut your clothes off, for example, I would ask you, I would let you know that there's, I, I'm, I'm pretty good at what I do, but there's no way that I can guarantee that, uh, I won't cut something that you don't want me to. So if possible, it'd be great if you could take off the thing that you wouldn't want me to cut, right. Like a necklace or your socks or whatever.

Speaker 3:          11:13          And I also like warn people going into them like I'm pretty experienced with this, but I definitely have accidentally cut people before. So, um, you know, I just need to let you know that this is not a 100% guarantee. If or if that's something that you absolutely cannot tolerate, then uh, then we probably can't go forward with this. Or if you say, well, I mean, I'm fine with it as long as it isn't on my arms cause I don't want to show up for work. That's like great. Like, well I'll just restrict what I do to not your arms.

Speaker 1:          11:41          She said sometimes she'll even get a pen and make a tiny little dot on all of the places the person says are off limits. Just so she can be super duper sure. She's respecting their wishes, their classes. I, hello everyone. Uh, most well organized BDSM scenes in the country.

Speaker 9:          12:00          Okay. You guys are allowed to talk here. Believe me, I know we have mikes around.

Speaker 1:          12:03          Have weekly or at least monthly classes. We actually went to one.

Speaker 9:          12:08          How many people here have taken any of my events before? Raise of hands. There we go. Everyone else is new.

Speaker 1:          12:14          It was in Manhattan, a small studio space. About 15 people were there. And uh, the instructor, a guy named dominous arrows was sort of at the front of the room in a leather kilt with these two leather straps across. Yeah.

Speaker 9:          12:27          Now is everyone here familiar with consent, please? All right, good. Is there anyone know what a difference between consent and enthusiastic consent? One guy in the back raised his hand. That's sort of a new thing that's sort of coming up in a lot of clubs. If there's a moment of hesitation in that person's brain, you should automatically be picking that up and be like, do you actually want to do this thing with me? And generally within the first 10 seconds, someone can tell if they want to have sex with you. You're not going to convince someone otherwise you're not gonna be like, man, I'm going to wear them down wearing not technique. It pisses me off at a party. Nobody owes you anything. Everyone on board so far,

Speaker 1:          13:02          a lot of nods. Good. So, and then, uh, he sort of demonstrated how all of this works. Inaction at first look at the table. He took everyone over to this table, showed them the toys, different kinds of whips. Floggers little stick with a feather. Yeah.

Speaker 9:          13:15          Let me grab what this going to be. My little tool to play around with. Grabbed one of the floggers

Speaker 1:          13:20          and then he and a woman named Bella who is in black lingerie, they a walk over to this giant cross looking thing in the corner of the room. She then leads against it.

Speaker 9:          13:30          Good. So I currently have Bella with the arms spread on the Saint Andrew's cross. Her legs going to be a little bit wider. Fella is not that tall now we've already had our top. Hey, what's cool, I just met you. Am I allowed to put my hand in your ass? The shoulders, your skin. Do you want to keep you close as is late or do you want to sort of slowly on dressed as we play? Get all your things because you don't know where they're at. They could tell you just want to be like this. Bella has told me she just don't want to take any more clothes off. Correct. Bella? Bella also doesn't like a huge amount of pain, so then we go with that feeling. All right. That's like your shoulders, a little funky. You want to warm them up. You don't go to the gym and do your heavier set right away. Correct. You going to sort of warm up the muscles? I do light touching. Like hitting. You start slowly whipping your shoulders. Yeah.

Speaker 10:         14:17          Some nights you get that. Here.

Speaker 9:          14:21          I'm sort of just observing, waiting for their body, sort of tell me some notes. When I do impact, their body's going to tell me something. If I go a little heavy.

Speaker 10:         14:29          Okay,

Speaker 9:          14:30          there's a little bit of a turtling in see you. The hips crawl in. If the ass comes right back out right away, that's saying, daddy hit me again. Right? If this stays turtle, then I've went a little heart. I can come in and stay and again, you're talking can be sexy. It's not so much for you. Baby is daddy needs to go lighter, keep sexy. You don't have to say, hey, was that too hard? You can totally keep it in very sexy and see how it goes. Staying engaged is very important. If you're in a space that's loud, you can't fucking hear anything. So I can hear if she's moaning or if she's like, oh, you know, so I want to be able to get my ears in clothes, see how they do. Then I create this sort of cadence, play around a little bit more and from there I'm combining between using impact play and sense play. We'll go a little more in depth once you guys start playing around a little bit. And I'll go around the room because I want to get into the

Speaker 11:         15:19          workshop aspect where dominance spent the next hour sort of moving around the room, helping people as they paired off with their whips and their floggers learn how to better read each other. And for a moment it felt like, oh, we should all be doing this. I mean maybe not using whips and having sex in public unless that's your thing, but finding ways to help each other be explicit and communicative and to have a code for what words mean. When we talked to college age men, women, a lot of them were like, we need a script. We need something written down. Because a, one of the things that's been found in surveys is that there's very little agreed upon language. For example, the phrase like slow down when surveyed, many college aged women will tell you that means stop. Many men will say, no, it just means goes slower. Well, in the BDSM world, they seem to have sorted some of this out.

Speaker 3:          16:16          So like I was at a play party and it said on the thing, oh, house rules say yellow means, uh, I, you should check in or pause. Red Means Stop. And if somebody says safe word, that means that, uh, you're calling for help from one of the people that's around.

Speaker 11:         16:36          It all seemed so clear and sensible. And Dare I say uncomplicated, but Julia was like, ah, yeah, no, no. Really.

Speaker 1:          16:47          When we come back, Julie Rains on the parade that we were throwing her.

Speaker 12:         16:53          This is Kelly calling from San Francisco. Radio lab is supported in part by the Alfred p Sloan Foundation, enhancing public understanding of science and technology in the modern world. More information aboutSloan@wwwdotsloan.org

Speaker 1:          17:39          wherever you get your podcasts. Hey, I'm Jad, we're back. Third installment of in the know and Julie was about to tell us, Julie [inaudible] that uh, even in the BDSM world with its very clear, uh, rules and safe words like red and yellow things go wrong.

Speaker 3:          18:00          The actual real problem with that yellow, red situation is that in public people almost never end up using red. Like there's one of the huge problems that the BDSM subculture basically has is that there's massive, massive social repercussions to calling red in a public place basically.

Speaker 1:          18:19          And as we talked about this more a, it's started to sound a lot like what we heard from the college aged women, uh, that saying no even, you know, when it's buttress by all of these rules and norms can still be really hard. There's a cost.

Speaker 3:          18:34          What are the worst situations that I ever personally found myself in, um, was I was tied up in suspended and uh, so all my feet are off the ground and I'm having a great time. I had negotiated ahead of time that there was to be nothing genital happening. It was very clear about that. And I was like, nope, this is not, this is not a thing.

Speaker 1:          18:56          Then she says the person who she was playing with who tied her up decided to try some genital stuff.

Speaker 3:          19:01          And I was really caught in that moment because we're in a very public place. Uh, I could yell red, but in that place yelling red means the whole scene has to stop. And I didn't want the scene to stop. I liked being tied up and I'm also cognizant of the fact that this guy is my friend. I really like him and I don't want him to get in a ton of trouble. But if I yelled red really loudly in this public place, there's a pretty decent chance he's going to get banned from the event. There's pretty decent chance he's going to get banned from a lot of events. And even if I kicked him in the face and he stopped cause I was gonna say you're tied up though. That's very, the whole point is you're in a compromised situation. I am in a compromised situation, but it turns out it puts my feet a lot closer to his face

Speaker 1:          19:49          even though she a navigated that one fine in the end she says generally speaking, the BDSM community is in terms of the consent negotiation, not a utopia. In fact, what she experienced in that moment was for a long time, not uncommon.

Speaker 3:          20:05          So I should explain that the [inaudible] actually got its own Mitsu movement about three months before the me too movement hit like I didn't have that Hashtag but exactly the same thing happened where a bunch of high status people got out at his consent violators in the scene. These are a bunch of dudes are, yeah, they're all men. There's definitely a lot of consent violations that happened with women, but people don't pay attention to it. And I have a whole other rant about that, but people who got a lot of attention on them were men and pretty much everyone that they had hurt was women.

Speaker 1:          20:31          And that's part of the reason that Julie is, uh, in the end, a little suspicious of all of the rules that we were just enamored of, or I should say she's a little suspicious of placing too much faith in those rules. It's

Speaker 3:          20:44          not, it's not foolproof, rightly so. I mean, I know people who they don't want to tell you anymore that they're not having fun. So there's a real sense of like, I don't want to disappoint this other person. So one of the things that I also will ask in these types of negotiating my version of negotiation is like, do you feel reasonably certain that you will be able to tell me if you don't like what's happening?

Speaker 11:         21:14          The more I thought about that question, like after we'd done the interview in morning, I was sort of noodling on that I the crew to me like what? That's a key question. Can you say no when you need to? Some of us just are people pleasers. I am one of those people, it hurts to say no if you know it's good bumps someone out, others have no problem with that. So she asks, which kind of person are you right now? It is situational. Who are you at this moment? If they say, yeah, right now, I'm not good with the no, then she goes one direction. If they say, no, no, I could tell you

Speaker 3:          21:46          then I'm like, all right, can we both agree that we are

Speaker 11:         21:49          adults, that we don't have to get into all this stuff about what we don't want to have happen

Speaker 3:          21:53          and that we will take responsibility for actually communicating how we're feeling in a situation. And if we fail to communicate that, that we will also take responsibility for that. So are you okay with kind of whatever and you're going to tell me if you're not, and the other person goes, yes. That's how I want that to go. At that point, our conversation changes from what am I not allowed to do to what do you find hot?

Speaker 1:          22:19          One of the things that we kept running into again and again was, um, this sentiment that, uh, was maybe best captured by a guy that Becca, and she misspoke too.

Speaker 8:          22:29          I'm Michael [inaudible]. I'm the director of empowering victims and I'm one of the people who came up with the concept for the we consent app.

Speaker 1:          22:36          That app was actually the one, uh, that a guy last episode, uh, sort of jokingly referred to. Hello. Would you be like, can I record you on my cell phone of you saying you're down to make out right now? Turns out it's actually a real app that this guy made.

Speaker 8:          22:51          There's no really good, the problem is that we've got to meme in the meeting is already well established and the meme is consent. Unfortunately that mean frames the entire question the wrong way. Consent means that you're giving someone permission to do something to you. We don't do sex to someone else. We have sex with someone else.

Speaker 1:          23:14          Are you saying that that's the like dictionary definition of consent? It's interesting cause I'm curious if this is just like a semantic

Speaker 8:          23:22          for this of consent is giving someone permission to do something to you or on your behalf.

Speaker 1:          23:28          Yeah, I just looked it up. And you're so compliance and or approval of what is done or proposed by another

Speaker 8:          23:36          wrong word.

Speaker 1:          23:38          And, uh, Joe for Shell, the academic that we heard from earlier. Yeah. If

Speaker 8:          23:41          it doesn't capture what I think is probably the biggest problem, young people and for sex on college campuses, which is all of the sex, it's consensual but unhappy and unpleasant and unwanted and people, typically women endure the core issue may not be non-consent and it may not be sex discrimination. It might be the fact that men are leveraging their positions of power to extract sex from women that don't want to be there. And I, and I think it's hard to target that problem if you call it non-consent.

Speaker 14:         24:24          it was the second day I went home with him and I wasn't really sure if I wanted to sleep with him and I was kind of going through the motions. Um, and at one point he pulled away cause you could tell that I was like not entirely there. And he's like, do you want to have sex? Um, and I, I kind of said like, ah, like I didn't even say yes or no and he just stopped entirely. And we just like, and that was it. And I remember being like, like relieved first and like really surprised, um, because he read my body like the second date, like read my body language, respected me and like didn't push.

Speaker 15:         24:54          I was at a bar a couple of weeks ago and, um, I was with this girl and you know, she was, we were both, you know, we're both pretty drunk and she was like, yeah, hey, you want to go out to my place? And I was like, I can't do that. Like I'm drunk. You're drunk. Like, she's like, you're right. And just kind of like we've out, we continue to like dance. I was fine. It was, we had a fine night and then like I woke up the next morning and she, uh, texted me and was like, Hey, thank you so much for like not taking advantage of me. Like that means a lot. I was like, that was really easy.

Speaker 14:         25:27          I've been lucky in that regard that like if I'm uncomfortable having sex with like my partner, like, like right when I'm about to be like, I can't, like I don't want to do this right now. He always catches like my eye is like, like he'll stop immediately in, in like, you know, I've had like my own sex trauma stuff and he like, I'm going to cry, but like he will stop. It's so nice to have a partner that can like read your body language and be like, this doesn't feel like feel right. Are you okay?
