00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.660
So, we've learned a little bit more about the relationship

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:05.340
between age and friend count. And we did that using

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.990
conditional means. We'll return to these two variables later and

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:11.560
we'll see the relationship to a third variable in less than

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:14.170
five. But for now, let's see how more used a

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:18.100
slightly different approach to pair a histogram to summarize her raw

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.670
data. So here's an example of how we paired raw

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.430
data with summary data. So, here we have these scatter plots,

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:27.910
where we're showing people's raw guesses of their perceived

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.970
audience size against their actual audience size. And you

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.390
can see they all fall below the perfect accuracy

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.200
line. So people underestimate. But it's still kind of hard

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.370
to get it the big picture from these scatter

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.010
plots and so, we have some histograms to capture

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.120
more summary data. In this case, these two histograms

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.580
show how much people over or underestimated their audience size.

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.665
So here on the left, at the 0 mark on the x axis, that's how many people

00:00:54.665 --> 00:00:58.100
guessed their audience size perfectly. If they had

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.930
a lighter color blue, those are people that underestimated

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.310
their audience. So you can kind of see

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:09.260
how many people underestimated their audience by about 25%,

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.960
versus 50%, versus 75% and so on. The

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.090
darker blue are people who overestimated their audience size.

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:17.020
And you can just see from the

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.420
chart far fewer people overestimated their audience size.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.675
If you look on the right side of these summary plots, this is for people's over

00:01:25.675 --> 00:01:28.170
underestimations when you ask them about the

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.080
whole month. How many people in general do

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.690
you think see your post? And you can

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.050
see that people don't underestimate quite as badly.
