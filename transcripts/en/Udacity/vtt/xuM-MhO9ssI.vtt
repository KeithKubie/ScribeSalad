00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.980
Now just to familiarize yourself with these problems a little bit more,

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:07.380
I would like to do the same thing that we have done here for these five problems.

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:11.290
I will now give you a number of practical scenarios.

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:15.920
What I would like you to tell me is which of these problems would probably be most useful

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.360
for attempting an NP completeness proof?

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:23.570
So again we will give these problems here numbers, one, two, three, and four,

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:28.480
and I will give you six practical scenarios where you can then choose

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.350
which problem to match to the scenarios, so you could have a scenario in Bioinformatics,

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.800
but you would like to compare DNA sequences to each other.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.240
And what you are trying to find out is how much information they have in common.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.420
You could have a scenario where you want to schedule computer programs.

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.470
What I mean by this is you have a bunch of computer programs.

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.950
You know approximately how much time you took those programs is going to take.

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.300
And you have a number of machines and of course you want to get as much work done as possible

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:02.070
within let's say the next hour so you have to decide which program to run on which machine

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.370
or you could have a question about let's say classrooms where you say,

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:10.220
"How many classrooms do we actually need for the next semester to teach our courses?"

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.630
So there will be certain courses that take place at a certain time or that cannot be scheduled together.

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.470
A new question is how many different rooms would we actually need?

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.590
Or you could have the scenario where two programmers

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.290
have been working on the same programming code.

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.330
And one of the programmers has made some changes and the other one has made some changes.

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.410
And now you need to get these two codes back together again,

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:34.480
and you do that by figuring out what they actually still have in common.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:38.250
Another problem could be that you have a number of vans or delivery trucks

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.380
that you would like to fill and you want to find out

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.280
how many vans you need to transport all of these packages here.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.020
They have different sizes. They have different priorities and so on.

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.570
And finally, a scenario that is none of the above so something else.

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.440
Please match the practical scenarios to the NP complete problem

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.390
that is most likely to occur in that scenario, and I want you to do this by entering numbers here

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.250
that correspond to these four problems.

00:02:06.250 --> 99:59:59.000
You'll have to use some of these problems here more than once.
