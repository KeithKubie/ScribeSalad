00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.960
Once again, I have some crazy
relationship between x and y.

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.320
And just to get a sense of
what this might look like,

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:10.200
if you plot all the x's and y's
that satisfy this relationship,

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.150
you get this nice
little clover pattern.

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.062
And I plotted this
off of Wolfram Alpha.

00:00:15.062 --> 00:00:16.770
But what I'm curious
about in this video,

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.680
as you might imagine
from the title,

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.090
is to figure out
the rate at which y

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.730
is changing with respect to x.

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:24.580
And we're going to have
to do it implicitly.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.482
We're going to have to find the
implicit derivative of this.

00:00:27.482 --> 00:00:29.690
We're going to have to derive
this implicitly or take

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:31.660
the derivative of it implicitly.

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.350
So let's apply our
derivative operator

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.920
to both sides of the derivative
with respect to x on the left

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.370
and the derivative with
respect to x on the right.

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.710
So once again, we
apply our chain rule.

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.650
The derivative of something to
the third power with respect

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.420
to that something is
going to be three times

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.610
that something squared.

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.040
And then we have
to multiply that

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.030
times the derivative of the
something with respect to x.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.760
So the derivative of this
thing with respect to x

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.460
is going to be 2x,
that's the derivative

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.350
of x squared with respect to
x, plus the derivative of y

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.200
squared with respect
to y is going

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.690
to be 2y times the derivative
of y with respect to x.

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.260
Once again, we're applying the
chain rule right over here.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.630
The derivative of something
squared with respect

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.100
to the something, which is
2y, times the derivative

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.130
of the something with
respect to x, which is dy dx.

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.360
Now, that is going
to be equal to what

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.670
we have on the right hand side.

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.780
So we have a 5 times x
squared times y squared.

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.580
We can take the 5 out
of the picture for now.

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.680
Take the 5 onto the-- take
it out of the derivative.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.230
The derivative of
5 times something

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:49.540
is the same thing as 5
times the derivative.

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.150
And now we can apply
the product rule.

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:59.060
So it's going to be 5 times
the derivative of x squared

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:05.215
is just going to be
2x times y squared.

00:02:05.215 --> 00:02:07.340
So that's just the derivative
of the first function

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.100
times the second function.

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.820
Plus the first function,
not taking its derivative,

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.640
x squared times the derivative
of the second function.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.350
Well, what's the derivative of
y squared with respect to x?

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:19.810
Well, we already figured it out.

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.700
It's the derivative of
y squared with respect

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:28.280
to y, which is 2y times the
derivative of y with respect

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.780
to x.

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.910
Let me make it clear
what I just did.

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:36.050
This is this, and then this
is when I took its derivative.

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:41.005
So that is when I applied
the derivative operator.

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.050
Similarly, that is that.

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.730
And when I applied the
derivative operator,

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.700
I got that.

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.580
The derivative with respect
to x right over there.

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:59.565
So let's see if we can
somehow solve for dy dx.

00:02:59.565 --> 00:03:01.440
So what I'm going to do
on the left hand side

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.160
is I'm just going to distribute
this purple thing onto both

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.400
of these terms.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.060
So if you distribute
this purple thing

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.050
onto this term
right over here, you

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:16.110
get 3 times 2x, which is 6x,
times x squared plus y squared,

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.230
squared.

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.360
And then if you distribute
this purple stuff

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.530
on to this one right over
here you get plus, let's see,

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:31.752
2y times 3 is 6y times x
squared plus y squared.

00:03:31.752 --> 00:03:32.460
Let me make sure.

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:35.860
2y times 3 is 6y times x
squared plus y squared,

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:39.810
squared, and then I'll keep
the dy dx in that green color.

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:47.870
dy dx is equal to, well,
we can multiply the 5 times

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.850
this business right over here.

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:51.360
And so everything
that's not a dy

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.070
dx term maybe I will
do in purple now.

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.470
So you do 5 times
this stuff right

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:01.470
over here, which gives
you 10xy squared.

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.570
And then 5 times all
of this right over here

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:11.432
is going to be plus
10x squared y dy dx.

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.070
Did I do that right?

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.240
Yep, that looks
just about right.

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:20.580
And now we have to
solve for dy dx.

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:21.954
What I'm going to
do is I'm going

00:04:21.954 --> 00:04:24.590
to subtract this 10x squared.

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:28.590
I'm going to subtract
the 10x squared y dy

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.650
dx from both sides.

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:36.780
10x squared y dy dx.

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:37.450
Derivative.

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:39.000
That's not green.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.800
Derivative of y
with respect to x.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.600
Going to subtract
that from both sides

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.750
so that I can get it
on the left hand side.

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:48.100
dy dx.

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.680
And I'm going to subtract
this business, this 6x times

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.770
all this craziness
from both sides.

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:57.665
So minus 6x times x squared
plus y squared, squared.

00:04:57.665 --> 00:04:59.370
Let me subtract it
from here as well.

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:04.690
Minus 6x x squared
plus y squared squared.

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:05.970
And what are we left with?

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:13.540
Well, these guys cancel out.

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:15.480
On the left hand
side right over here,

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:21.490
we are left with 6y times
x squared plus y squared,

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:27.330
squared minus 10x
squared y times

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.700
dy dx, the derivative
of y with respect to x.

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:33.400
The derivative of
y with respect to x

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.800
is equal to-- these
characters cancel out--

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:44.520
and we are left with 10xy
squared minus 6x times

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:49.320
x squared plus y
squared, squared.

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.570
And now if we want
to solve for dy dx,

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:53.860
we just divide both
sides of this equation

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:55.860
by this business
right over here.

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:58.950
And you get the derivative
of y with respect to x.

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:00.700
And we deserve a drum roll now.

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:03.190
The derivative of
y with respect to x

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:06.150
is equal to all of this stuff.

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:08.330
And I'm just going
to copy and paste it.

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:11.380
So let me copy and paste it.

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:15.830
All of that stuff
over all of this stuff

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:18.140
over all of that stuff.

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:22.870
Once again, just going
to copy and paste it.

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:26.230
And I just have to draw
the little fraction symbol.

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:28.320
So we are done.

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:30.900
We have figured out-- and it
was kind of a hairy expression,

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:32.690
but it didn't take
us too long-- what

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:36.032
the derivative of y with
respect to x at any point is.

00:06:36.032 --> 00:06:37.990
So what you'd want to do
is if you want to say,

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:41.614
hey, what is the slope of
the tangent line right at--

00:06:41.614 --> 00:06:43.780
let me do this in a color
that you can actually see.

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:46.400
What is the slope of the tangent
line right at that point?

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.970
Well, you'd want to figure out
what the x-coordinate of that

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:52.120
point it so you
could say maybe x

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:53.790
is this value right over here.

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:55.800
And then you can solve
for y to figure out

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:57.840
what the y value would be.

00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:59.860
And then you would
chunk that x and

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:02.170
y into this hairy
expression right over here

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:09.930
to figure out the slope
of the tangent line.
