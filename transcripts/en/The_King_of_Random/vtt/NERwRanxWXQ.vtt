00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.389
Hey, guys. Welcome back to the King of Random. Today, we're going to be trying an experiment

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:06.778
I've seen some people do before, but haven't seen very well explained.

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:12.659
We're going to try to be making what's called "fire snakes", a combination of burning sugar and baking soda in a base of sand.

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:15.509
We're gonna try a few different combinations of regular sugar,

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:20.639
powdered sugar, baking soda, and two different types of accelerant to see what gives us the very best results.

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:26.939
We've got a giant bag of sand and some metal trays to burn our sugar in, so let's get started. Now, all of my research

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.619
Indicates that it should be four parts of sugar to one part baking soda by weight.

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.269
So, that's what we're gonna do. We're gonna try three things. We're gonna have our regular sugar mixed with our baking soda.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.610
We're going to have our powdered sugar mixed with our baking soda.

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.700
And then we're also going to try mixing some of our regular sugar with the baking soda

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.549
and then blending it up so we have an even finer powder.

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:50.219
We'll see how that does in comparison. We'll take all three of those mixtures and try burning each of them with alcohol and lighter

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.819
fluid and see which of our six combinations gives us the best results.

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.210
White powders everywhere...

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.629
20 grams of regular sugar. Add 5 grams of baking soda.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.870
And except another one of the same thing which I'll blend in just a minute

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.060
One thing that might cause a different result with the powdered sugar is most powdered sugar

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.369
Actually, also has some cornstarch in it to help keep it from taking together too much

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.850
Grams or bacon

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.479
Now let's get a little blender and blend up one of the mixtures of regular sugar and baking soda

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.880
Yes unsurprisingly that now kind of looks like powdered sugar

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.569
All right, we've got our three different trays for our three different mixtures. Let's build these up with sand

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.859
My first fuel is 91% concentration of isopropyl alcohol also known as rubbing alcohol

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.980
My other one is a common barbecue lighter fluid

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.789
I'm going to pour some of each fluid on one side of the sand and

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.980
then we'll put little piles of each kind of sugar on that so overall we'll have 6 different combinations of

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.170
sugar and fuel going at once

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.560
So here we've got

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.000
Granulated sugar and alcohol is the fuel here?

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:03.199
We've got granulated sugar and lighter fluid as a fuel blend and sugar with alcohol when it's your lighter fluid powdered sugar

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.050
alcohol powdered sugar lightest

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:22.480
A little harder time getting the lighter fluid delight than the alcohol, so that's one point for alcohol

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:26.349
That when it lit well

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:34.270
Here we go

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:09.400
So let's take a little bit of a look at what is happening here as the sugar burns

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:16.360
it bubbles and boils and turns black and turns into just basically carbon some of the gas is being led off by the

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:21.129
Baking soda are actually filling the molten sugar as its creative

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:26.649
It doesn't just turn into a puddle of black sugar it turns into a sort of expanded foam of black sugar

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:31.299
Well here we go here's the results of our test the powdered sugar

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.069
definitely started making the fire snakes the fastest they took off pretty quickly the

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.220
powdered sugar with the lighter fluid never got very far

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:44.020
We only got this one little weird stumpy thing which still looks pretty cool

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.949
But it's not very big you can see most of the sugar is still just kind of there

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:49.340
clumps together

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.160
another interesting point something

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.179
I want to talk about is that if you've seen videos of this before it doesn't occur to you

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.350
How unbelievably lightweight this stuff is because you have a pile of sugar

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:07.000
that's all of the mass and then it's just expanded out to this large snake, so this thing weighs almost nothing is like styrofoam because

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.980
It's also incredibly fragile look at this it just

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:17.709
Comes right apart you can see how light and fluffy it is inside then if I crush it

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:23.920
Basically just turns into dust I'm solid you just watch dust fly up off of it

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:31.600
Powdered sugar with alcohol that one worked great it started off very quickly it kept going for quite a while

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.020
There is still a lump of unburned sugar down at the bottom

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.329
But it's pretty small it really got most of it

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:44.049
That grew and twist it around and we got like a secondary growth coming off of it at one point. I'm pretty good

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:47.500
That's a lot of big black snake curls wonderfully

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:50.679
There's I don't know if you can get to some cameras even a little bits of

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:54.460
Iridescent sort of colored going through parts of this so it's pretty neat

00:05:54.860 --> 00:06:01.960
So powdered sugar with alcohol is a fuel that works really well our blended sugar well our blended sugar with the lighter fluid

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.360
Got basically nowhere

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:06.610
Almost all the sugar

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:09.400
Mixed with the baking soda is still here didn't burn

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:14.380
We got a little bit of result, but not a lot blended sugar with the alcohol

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:18.489
It took a while, and then it did start growing, but it didn't get very far

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:25.269
It's not bad that does kind of look like a cool demon horn some sort of cancerous sand growth or something

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:27.290
Not bad

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:29.290
granulated sugar with lighter fluid

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.790
again, not very impressive

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:36.429
I took this piece off to try and let some of the sugar inside get a little more access to the heat

00:06:36.889 --> 00:06:38.889
Didn't really seem to do much

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:42.130
This still looks cool, but it's very small. It didn't go very far

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:45.399
I'm actually gonna try eating a tiny bit of this and it's gonna taste terrible

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:49.959
I'm hoping this inner part will just taste like burnt sugar, and it won't all taste just like carbon

00:06:54.979 --> 00:06:58.719
There's also baking soda in it so it's like salty burn sugar no

00:06:58.940 --> 00:06:59.780
Yeah

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:01.070
It's terrible

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:03.399
granulated sugar and alcohol this took a good while to

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:08.559
Start doing anything like it it took a long time for it to get beyond just this first little bit

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:14.109
But eventually it started growing really well, and it just kept going until even though it is very lightweight

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:19.719
Eventually I had enough weight to just break a piece off and then it started making another piece and the mountain broke off and then

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:21.650
Another piece for it came and that broke off

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:28.120
And it's just kept on going so I think we definitely got the most volume out of the granulated sugar

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:31.359
Eventually the the powdered sugar definitely took off faster

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:37.239
But in the end, I think the granulated sugar was the most firesnake you at all

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:40.930
Oh, it's pretty close tie between those two I actually liked both of them pretty well

00:07:41.419 --> 00:07:47.469
But I'm gonna say the granulated sugar with my favorite. Just because it kept going and diminishing and getting smaller and smaller

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:54.459
I think it's pretty clear that the 91% isopropyl alcohol that we were using is a much better fuel than the lighter fluid

00:07:55.099 --> 00:07:56.180
so

00:07:56.180 --> 00:08:01.150
Isopropyl alcohol very good granulated sugar or powdered sugar both quite good

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:05.589
Blended sugar not really so good, so we're not going to use that anymore well

00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:10.690
I'm gonna clean this up, and then I have a couple ideas of how to scale this up to something a little bit larger

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:18.520
It just disappears

00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:21.939
I'm gonna use our powdered sugar mix for this one because it started going

00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:24.969
Fastest and use the alcohol of course because that works way better

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:30.699
And I'm just gonna set up like a whole bunch of different spots on one tray of sand I'm gonna

00:08:30.699 --> 00:08:32.479
Hope they kind of grow together

00:08:32.479 --> 00:08:34.370
into one giant

00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:36.969
Fire flame smoke log. We'll see what happens

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:47.539
All right, oh, it's good. Let's light it up

00:08:52.889 --> 00:08:54.889
Lit and it's good

00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:26.440
That was pretty cool

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:30.580
It wasn't exactly what I was hoping for I was hoping for we just kind of get like a large

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:35.079
Column of this stuff rising up and that didn't really work out, but it did get some good volume

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:39.670
We got quite a bit of the black snake material, which looked a little bit cooler well

00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:42.490
It's still on the tray make a couple of times. I cleared it off

00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:48.160
So we could like let the new stuff go in without all the weight of what was on there crushing it down overall

00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:51.020
pretty neat

00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:53.139
I've got one more thing that I want to try

00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:56.169
And it's gonna take up a little more space for

00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:03.160
All these ins I am using the powdered sugar rather than the granulated sugar just because it starts going

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:09.670
Faster still think the granulated sugar might be better for a total result in getting the biggest longest snakes

00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:11.670
I just didn't want to wait for it this time

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:15.760
Now we've got 13 fire snakes going at once

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:21.129
I've spread them out a little bit more so that they hopefully won't bond together like they were in the last one this way

00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:26.230
I'm hoping we just get 13 different snakes rising a foot or two off of the tray

00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:44.579
Well there we go

00:10:44.579 --> 00:10:52.249
13 different black snakes all in one tray all together making this sort of weird twisted field of gnarled growing things

00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:54.829
I don't even know what to call them, but that looks pretty cool

00:10:54.829 --> 00:10:58.309
It was fun to do and guys this experiment is so

00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:02.359
easy powdered sugar baking soda and rubbing alcohol

00:11:02.579 --> 00:11:05.179
You just put that in a little bit of sand and light it

00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:09.079
And you get this it's like the cheapest experiment you could ever do and it looks so cool

00:11:09.079 --> 00:11:15.979
I found that I had really good results using both granulated sugar and powdered sugar the powdered sugar started working a little bit faster the

00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:20.599
Granulated sugar kept going longer, so you kind of have to choose, which one you prefer

00:11:20.639 --> 00:11:26.899
I definitely found that the 91% rubbing alcohol worked better as a fuel than the lighter fluid. I think it started better

00:11:26.899 --> 00:11:28.620
I think it burned more consistently and

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:33.409
Just gave us better results in the end if you're trying this at home make sure you're doing it in place with good ventilation

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:38.449
Make sure you're not gonna light anything on fire around you and you have proper safety equipment to put anything out

00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:40.579
But this is absolutely something you can do at home

00:11:40.709 --> 00:11:44.179
Thanks for joining us for this project today, and we'll see you in the next one talk to you then

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:50.419
And now I'm gonna see how quickly I can vacuum all of this up, so it's just go on

00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:09.270
Probably the most satisfying thing to vacuum that I've ever vacuumed

00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:19.380
Hey guys

00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:22.559
