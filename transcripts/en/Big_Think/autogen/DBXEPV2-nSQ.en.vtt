everybody's talking about gold these

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.070
everybody's talking about gold these
 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:03.770
everybody's talking about gold these
days and I wish I had some to show you

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780
days and I wish I had some to show you
 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.590
days and I wish I had some to show you
but I don't own any so sorry the thing

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600
but I don't own any so sorry the thing
 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.830
but I don't own any so sorry the thing
about gold is it is a very important

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840
about gold is it is a very important
 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.720
about gold is it is a very important
part of our financial system when we're

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730
part of our financial system when we're
 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.060
part of our financial system when we're
looking at the expectation of inflation

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070
looking at the expectation of inflation
 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.430
looking at the expectation of inflation
because even though inflation can mean

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440
because even though inflation can mean
 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.109
because even though inflation can mean
that the value of currencies go down

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119
that the value of currencies go down
 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.450
that the value of currencies go down
gold is supposed to hold its value and

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460
gold is supposed to hold its value and
 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.609
gold is supposed to hold its value and
that's because people will always accept

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619
that's because people will always accept
 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.980
that's because people will always accept
gold in trade for other things so we

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990
gold in trade for other things so we
 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.650
gold in trade for other things so we
hope gold has intrinsic value gold is

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660
hope gold has intrinsic value gold is
 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.870
hope gold has intrinsic value gold is
nice to look at and it's useful in a lot

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880
nice to look at and it's useful in a lot
 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.849
nice to look at and it's useful in a lot
of commercial products but it's also

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859
of commercial products but it's also
 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.880
of commercial products but it's also
accepted and has been symbolically for

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890
accepted and has been symbolically for
 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.410
accepted and has been symbolically for
hundreds of years as a medium of

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420
hundreds of years as a medium of
 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.959
hundreds of years as a medium of
exchange as a unit of account and as a

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969
exchange as a unit of account and as a
 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.790
exchange as a unit of account and as a
store of value there could have been

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800
store of value there could have been
 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.860
store of value there could have been
another focal point perhaps it could

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870
another focal point perhaps it could
 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.440
another focal point perhaps it could
have been quartz quartz would have been

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450
have been quartz quartz would have been
 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.389
have been quartz quartz would have been
seen as a great store of value but

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399
seen as a great store of value but
 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:48.770
seen as a great store of value but
traditionally quartz doesn't have that

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780
traditionally quartz doesn't have that
 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.450
traditionally quartz doesn't have that
role even though like gold there's

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460
role even though like gold there's
 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.340
role even though like gold there's
probably a limited supply of quartz

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350
probably a limited supply of quartz
 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.680
probably a limited supply of quartz
crystals in the world gold is where it's

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690
crystals in the world gold is where it's
 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.810
crystals in the world gold is where it's
act and everybody sort of accepts gold

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820
act and everybody sort of accepts gold
 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.970
act and everybody sort of accepts gold
that's what makes it valuable the

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980
that's what makes it valuable the
 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.099
that's what makes it valuable the
problem is if we were to base our

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109
problem is if we were to base our
 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.229
problem is if we were to base our
monetary system on gold that some people

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239
monetary system on gold that some people
 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.690
monetary system on gold that some people
like Ron Paul had proposed we would have

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700
like Ron Paul had proposed we would have
 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.030
like Ron Paul had proposed we would have
a fixed amount of gold equal to one

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040
a fixed amount of gold equal to one
 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.370
a fixed amount of gold equal to one
dollar and every time we wanted to issue

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380
dollar and every time we wanted to issue
 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.320
dollar and every time we wanted to issue
more currency we would have to make sure

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330
more currency we would have to make sure
 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.390
more currency we would have to make sure
that we had that much more gold in our

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400
that we had that much more gold in our
 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.390
that we had that much more gold in our
treasury what happens then though think

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400
treasury what happens then though think
 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.730
treasury what happens then though think
about what would happen if somebody

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740
about what would happen if somebody
 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.050
about what would happen if somebody
discovered a huge amount of new gold

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060
discovered a huge amount of new gold
 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.340
discovered a huge amount of new gold
that we didn't know about in the world

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350
that we didn't know about in the world
 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.620
that we didn't know about in the world
all of a sudden the supply of gold would

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630
all of a sudden the supply of gold would
 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.359
all of a sudden the supply of gold would
be much higher and that would probably

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369
be much higher and that would probably
 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.100
be much higher and that would probably
mean that the price of gold would go

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110
mean that the price of gold would go
 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.350
mean that the price of gold would go
down in world markets but that would

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360
down in world markets but that would
 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.910
down in world markets but that would
have a profound effect on our own

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920
have a profound effect on our own
 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.490
have a profound effect on our own
currency too because each of our dollars

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500
currency too because each of our dollars
 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.469
currency too because each of our dollars
would now be worth less through no fault

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479
would now be worth less through no fault
 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.170
would now be worth less through no fault
of our own so we would have a devalued

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180
of our own so we would have a devalued
 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.420
of our own so we would have a devalued
currency simply as a result of this

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430
currency simply as a result of this
 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.969
currency simply as a result of this
discovery of gold that's not something

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979
discovery of gold that's not something
 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.530
discovery of gold that's not something
that we want to mess around with because

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540
that we want to mess around with because
 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.359
that we want to mess around with because
it means that other people and other

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369
it means that other people and other
 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.880
it means that other people and other
events can control our monetary policy

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890
events can control our monetary policy
 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.069
events can control our monetary policy
which is one of our most basic tools for

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079
which is one of our most basic tools for
 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.139
which is one of our most basic tools for
affecting our economy and our economic

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149
affecting our economy and our economic
 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.859
affecting our economy and our economic
cycle so if you want to use gold as part

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869
cycle so if you want to use gold as part
 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.450
cycle so if you want to use gold as part
of our monetary system you have to think

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460
of our monetary system you have to think
 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.700
of our monetary system you have to think
very hard about the fluctuations that

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710
very hard about the fluctuations that
 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.399
very hard about the fluctuations that
we'd be exposing ourselves to

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409
we'd be exposing ourselves to
 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:05.469
we'd be exposing ourselves to
you
