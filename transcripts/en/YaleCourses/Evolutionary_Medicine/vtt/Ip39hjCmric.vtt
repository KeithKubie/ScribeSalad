1
00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:01.370
Yeah,

2
00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:06.350
<v 1>reproductive success is at the center of natural selection and it's therefore no</v>

3
00:00:06.351 --> 00:00:11.351
surprise that evolutionary thinking plays a big role in how we look at

4
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.950
reproduction is an aspect of evolutionary medicine.

5
00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.880
We're going to start by seeing the history of the Mammalian reproductive tract.

6
00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:25.643
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

7
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:26.850
<v 1>The youth therians,</v>

8
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.180
the mammals that have a long gestation period with a well-developed placenta

9
00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.450
have a reproductive system that is an evolutionary innovation

10
00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:41.060
in females.

11
00:00:41.061 --> 00:00:45.800
It's derived from ancestral Oregon's that previously had produced eggs that

12
00:00:45.801 --> 00:00:47.180
exited through a Clo Waco.

13
00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.940
The innovations include the uterus,
the endometrium,
the placenta,

14
00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.893
and the vagina.

15
00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.360
<v 0>Okay.</v>

16
00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.440
<v 1>These innovations are accomplished by changes in the developmental control of</v>

17
00:00:59.441 --> 00:01:03.010
cells and tissues and in this case,

18
00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:08.040
the genes that are used to control developmental fates in the reproductive tract

19
00:01:08.321 --> 00:01:12.580
had previously evolve to control the development of the body axis and the limbs,

20
00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.530
and so that's where we're going to start.

21
00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:16.170
<v 0>Okay.</v>

22
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.321
<v 1>Now,</v>

23
00:01:16.321 --> 00:01:21.321
the key issue in development is how to coordinate what many different cell types

24
00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.340
are becoming.

25
00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.150
If we go back in the history of biology,

26
00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.350
the fact that organisms are built out of cells is something we've known since

27
00:01:32.351 --> 00:01:36.100
1839 that's this fond schleiden cell hypothesis.

28
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.270
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

29
00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.090
<v 1>These cells communicate with each other.</v>

30
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.150
They send and receive information on their spatial location and they use that

31
00:01:44.731 --> 00:01:49.410
information to change their cell fates.
That is what they differentiate into.

32
00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:50.770
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

33
00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.770
<v 1>So virtually all cells in the eukaryotic body contain all the information</v>

34
00:01:56.891 --> 00:01:59.380
necessary to produce the entire organism.

35
00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:03.340
The only reason we say virtually is that we have a few cells like the red blood

36
00:02:03.341 --> 00:02:05.530
cells that do not contain a nucleus.

37
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.270
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

38
00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.320
<v 1>And therefore development is controlled by regulating gene expression,</v>

39
00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.640
not by discarding genes in order to get different tissue types.

40
00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.670
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

41
00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.670
<v 1>Much of treat evolution has changed when and where genes are expressed and not</v>

42
00:02:23.461 --> 00:02:25.770
the DNA sequences of structural genes.

43
00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.860
We're going to see a good example of that when we look at the Mammalian

44
00:02:28.861 --> 00:02:29.730
reproductive tract.

45
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.590
<v 0>Okay.</v>

46
00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.010
<v 1>So what does development actually do in evolution?</v>

47
00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.840
It shapes the variation in the genome that gets presented to selection.

48
00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.720
The developmental mechanisms that are shared among related organisms constrain

49
00:02:46.721 --> 00:02:50.350
the responses to selection in ways that are shared by relatives.

50
00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.850
That's why species resemble shared ancestors and basic body plans.

51
00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:58.810
And that is why ancestry influences responses to selection.

52
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.620
To think about that.
Uh,

53
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.720
a fruit fly has wings and six legs and it will respond to selection on its

54
00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.720
ability to fly or to walk in quite a different way than a bird that has two

55
00:03:13.721 --> 00:03:15.250
wings and two legs.

56
00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:22.960
Now genes build organisms out of materials that are interacting in complex

57
00:03:23.121 --> 00:03:27.950
systems and those materials have to obey the laws of physics and chemistry.

58
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.170
So genes have to work with the properties of those materials in constructing a

59
00:03:33.171 --> 00:03:34.004
phenotype.

60
00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.690
They can't directly control every detail of the phenotype.

61
00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.750
So we shouldn't imagine that you tations are able to change things in arbitrary

62
00:03:44.901 --> 00:03:45.920
ways.
They can't,

63
00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.580
they are handed a set of systems and materials and they have to work with it.

64
00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.900
Evolution has shaped the properties of developmental systems by working with

65
00:03:56.121 --> 00:03:58.910
what they got from it's from ancestors.
Okay.

66
00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:03.940
So they modify existing systems and that is done by working with whatever

67
00:04:04.371 --> 00:04:09.340
variance are available at the time.
So not necessarily the best option,

68
00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:14.150
simply the best of those available.
Thus,
evolution doesn't design organisms.

69
00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.550
Apriori is would an engineer.

70
00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:21.710
It designs organisms in a process of sequential approximation.

71
00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:24.890
<v 2>Now</v>

72
00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:29.890
<v 1>the major players in gene regulation are sketched here in this figure</v>

73
00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:38.200
transcription is going to begin here and the DNA that will be coding for a

74
00:04:39.111 --> 00:04:42.770
protein is going to be laid down off here to the right,

75
00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:44.810
just upstream of it.

76
00:04:44.811 --> 00:04:49.760
There's an enhancer sequence and a promoter sequence and the gene is turned on

77
00:04:49.761 --> 00:04:54.761
or off by transcription factors and enhancers that bind to these sequences.

78
00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:01.340
So these are being produced,
uh,
their proteins,

79
00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.750
they're being produced by other genes that are regulating the expression of this

80
00:05:05.751 --> 00:05:06.584
gene.

81
00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.800
And you can see that depending upon what combination of transcription factors

82
00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:18.980
this particular gene gets,
it will be turned on or off.

83
00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:21.470
Once it is turned on,

84
00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:26.420
the RNA polymerase starts walking down the DNA double helix,

85
00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:27.710
making messenger RNA.

86
00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:30.563
<v 2>So</v>

87
00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:34.450
<v 1>gene expression is not only controlled by transcription factors,</v>

88
00:05:34.451 --> 00:05:38.750
it's also controlled by acetylation which to which will uh,

89
00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:44.070
Wa unwind the DNA from the histones on around which it is wrapped or bind it to

90
00:05:45.971 --> 00:05:49.600
those histones.
So acetylation can uncover large,

91
00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:54.010
large stretches of DNA and methylation is a bit more specific.

92
00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:59.430
It can a bind just to one gene and prevent it from being expressed.

93
00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:05.680
And then there's also phosphorylation of histone tails that will activate or

94
00:06:06.321 --> 00:06:09.380
repress chromatin.
So on a spatial scale,

95
00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:14.030
genes can be silenced or expressed either over large stretches,

96
00:06:14.031 --> 00:06:16.460
intermediate stretches,
or just a single genes.

97
00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:19.450
<v 0>Okay.</v>

98
00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:23.470
<v 1>A few general points
at the beginning of development,</v>

99
00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:24.760
usually in the egg,

100
00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:30.030
a concentration gradient is giving positional information so it will determine

101
00:06:30.251 --> 00:06:32.950
which is going to be the head in which is going to be the tail,

102
00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.680
which is going to be next to the body,

103
00:06:35.681 --> 00:06:40.150
which will be far away from the body and which will be the back in which will be

104
00:06:40.151 --> 00:06:44.770
the stomach,
anterior,
posterior and dorsal lateral dorsal ventral

105
00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:48.940
transcription factors in histone regulation.

106
00:06:48.941 --> 00:06:53.380
Then define specific areas of the genome who are precise.

107
00:06:53.381 --> 00:06:55.330
Subset of genes is expressed.

108
00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:01.570
Gene expression importantly is often regulated by combinations of activators and

109
00:07:01.571 --> 00:07:02.404
repressors.

110
00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:06.370
This is important because it means that a limited number of activators and

111
00:07:06.371 --> 00:07:10.180
repressors can be put into different combinations to generate many,

112
00:07:10.181 --> 00:07:15.181
many more possible targets for activation or silencing this common tutorial

113
00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:22.890
control then permits a huge diversity of cell specific gene expressions.

114
00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:25.110
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

115
00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:29.190
<v 1>Jeez.
That produce transcription factors are regulated by genes that produce</v>

116
00:07:29.191 --> 00:07:30.330
transcription factors.

117
00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:35.700
So there is a hierarchy of transcriptional control.

118
00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:41.820
The same genes that play one role in the embryo can play another role in the

119
00:07:41.821 --> 00:07:45.870
adult.
And this is one of the mechanisms that underlies ply a trophy.

120
00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:47.670
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

121
00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:51.600
<v 1>Genes that control the general patterns switch on first and then genes</v>

122
00:07:51.601 --> 00:07:53.730
controlling progressive layers of detail.

123
00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:57.840
One of the important sets,
not the only one,

124
00:07:57.841 --> 00:08:02.310
but one of the important sets of developmental control genes are called the

125
00:08:02.311 --> 00:08:06.660
hawks are homeobox genes.
They are deeply conserved.

126
00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:09.010
That means that,
uh,

127
00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:12.690
we can see because they are shared by many different organisms that they

128
00:08:12.691 --> 00:08:17.550
originated long ago and they have,
they have retained their function.

129
00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:20.670
And their sequence on chromosomes.

130
00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:24.600
They have an interesting property of being colinear.

131
00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:30.230
What that means is that the sequence on the chromosome is analogous to the part

132
00:08:32.101 --> 00:08:37.101
of the body in which that gene is turned on or off to express a certain pattern.

133
00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:39.990
<v 0>Okay,</v>

134
00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:43.860
<v 1>so the anterior genes are coming here on the left,</v>

135
00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:46.980
the ones that are controlling the central part of the body or in the middle and

136
00:08:46.981 --> 00:08:51.810
the ones that are controlling the development of the rear of the body are

137
00:08:51.811 --> 00:08:53.070
expressed here on the right.

138
00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:58.940
This is a tree and it shows that the genes that are expressed in the anterior of

139
00:09:01.861 --> 00:09:06.861
Drosophila are also expressed in the anterior of worms and of mice and of sea

140
00:09:09.781 --> 00:09:14.640
urchins.
So this is a very ancient set of genes.

141
00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:21.320
Here we can see an embryonic fruit fly and an embryonic mouse and you can see

142
00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:26.780
that the hawks be one gene which is controlling the hindbrain of the mouse is

143
00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:32.010
homologous to the lab gene,

144
00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:37.020
which is controlling the formation of the brain of the sly and so forth.

145
00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:38.970
You can see going back through the body.

146
00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:44.990
The sequence of hawks genes in the mouse is in the same linear sequence as the

147
00:09:47.131 --> 00:09:49.800
genes in the,
in the body of the fly.

148
00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:57.480
Now duplicating this set of genes,

149
00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:01.350
preserve their control function and it allowed new applications.

150
00:10:01.351 --> 00:10:04.230
So in the lineage which leads up to the vertebrates,

151
00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:08.250
the hocks gene complex was duplicated twice.
Along with the whole genome,

152
00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:11.300
we actually have,
uh,

153
00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:14.010
had to duplication events of our genome.

154
00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:19.970
So we can see here both in the fore limb and the hind limb that Hawk's genes

155
00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:25.890
nine 10,
11,
12,
and 13 are controlling limb structure.

156
00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:30.000
And if nine and 10 are on,

157
00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:32.340
basically it is saying make a humorous.

158
00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:36.090
If 10 and 11 are on,

159
00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:39.960
it's saying make a radius and Alma and if 11,

160
00:10:39.961 --> 00:10:44.310
12 and 13 are on it saying make risks and digits.

161
00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:48.480
And similarly in the hind limb,
so

162
00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:55.040
evolution took advantage of the existence of a developmental switch and a set of

163
00:10:58.111 --> 00:11:03.111
developmental rules for gene expression that originally had been set up to

164
00:11:03.541 --> 00:11:07.770
control the body axis,
head thorax,
tail.

165
00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:13.400
And when the vertebrate limb came along and it was being developed out of

166
00:11:13.411 --> 00:11:16.770
precursors that were fins in the fish,

167
00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:22.580
it's simply took that and took a duplicate copy of it and use the same kind of

168
00:11:22.771 --> 00:11:26.370
set of rules to lay down a sequence in the limb.

169
00:11:26.610 --> 00:11:28.950
That is like the sequence of the body axis.

170
00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:31.560
<v 2>Okay.</v>

171
00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:34.560
<v 1>Now let's take a look at the female reproductive system.</v>

172
00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:39.800
We needed all of that history to set up this neat thing about the developmental

173
00:11:40.441 --> 00:11:45.120
control of the female reproductive system in you therians.

174
00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:48.690
It is radically different from monotremes and other amnios.

175
00:11:48.691 --> 00:11:52.260
So the monotremes or the duck billed platypus is in the spiny a kid knows.

176
00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:55.930
Then we have the marsupials and we have the placentals and as we go from the

177
00:11:55.931 --> 00:12:00.760
amphibians through birds and reptiles to monitor seems to Marsupial's to

178
00:12:00.761 --> 00:12:01.594
placentas.

179
00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:06.930
You can see that we go from having a [inaudible] to having a vagina and then

180
00:12:08.621 --> 00:12:12.540
finally to having a well developed uterus,
uh,

181
00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:17.580
which is quite a distinct set of organs that look really considerably different

182
00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:24.250
from what we had in say something like a monitoring.

183
00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:28.990
So if we look at that in terms of timing and in history,

184
00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:33.250
the first thing that happened is that there was reduced reliance on yoke and

185
00:12:33.251 --> 00:12:38.080
there were some uterine secretions.
Then the Cloaca was divided,

186
00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:42.970
so there was a vagina and uh,
a rectum

187
00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:50.380
so that those became separate,
separate entrances or exits.
Uh,

188
00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:54.400
the Avo docs differentiated self,

189
00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:57.640
the shelf formation to make eggs stopped,

190
00:12:58.270 --> 00:13:02.050
the uterus developed and began to nourish embryos.

191
00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:06.310
And the placenta originated that we share with marsupials.

192
00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:11.140
And then in the placentals mammals like us,
the youth Ariens,

193
00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:12.783
the

194
00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:17.460
plus the uterus and the placenta were elaborated,

195
00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:22.230
the embryo became invasive and there was a longer period of internal
development.

196
00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:30.020
When we look at the genes that control the you in female reproductive tract,

197
00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:35.970
we find some very familiar actors.
Hawks nine,
10,

198
00:13:35.971 --> 00:13:40.230
11 and 13.
So when a hawks,
a nine is switched on,

199
00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:44.310
the Fallopian tubes are formed.
When hawks a 10 is switched on,

200
00:13:44.311 --> 00:13:49.311
the upper uteruses formed a 11 is the lower uterus and a 13 is determining the

201
00:13:49.921 --> 00:13:50.754
vagina.

202
00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:56.310
So these are now controlled by the hawks genes that are in the first set.

203
00:13:56.850 --> 00:13:58.170
And earlier in development.

204
00:13:58.171 --> 00:14:00.570
These are the same genes that laid down the body axis.

205
00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:04.123
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

206
00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:08.350
<v 1>So they also have some other functions,
hocks eight,
10 and 11.</v>

207
00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:13.000
Downregulate the immune system in the endometrium that helps the uh,

208
00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:18.120
Zygote to implant and hawks a 10 is also involved in endometrial maturation and

209
00:14:20.321 --> 00:14:25.321
in Zygote attachment a 11 in an endometrial maturation and a 13 in the umbilical

210
00:14:27.521 --> 00:14:28.354
arteries.

211
00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:34.440
So the point is that a preexisting set of developmental switches was co opted

212
00:14:35.351 --> 00:14:38.950
and used to help in the evolution of a novelty.

213
00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:44.550
It was expressed in a new new place and uh,

214
00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:49.120
this is all done through transcriptional factor control of gene expression.

215
00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:53.740
Now interestingly,

216
00:14:53.741 --> 00:14:58.150
one of the innovations that developmental control was caused by the insertion of

217
00:14:58.151 --> 00:14:59.080
a Transposon,

218
00:14:59.350 --> 00:15:04.350
we previously saw that the insertion of a transpose on was a critical step in

219
00:15:04.421 --> 00:15:09.421
the evolution of the vertebrate immune system is what brought in the machinery

220
00:15:09.821 --> 00:15:13.360
that allows for sematic recombination here.

221
00:15:14.410 --> 00:15:19.410
This transposon inserted upstream from a target gene bringing other jeans under

222
00:15:19.811 --> 00:15:22.990
control of that transcription factor.

223
00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:27.130
And in this case and endometrial stromal cells,

224
00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:30.640
the transcription of prolactin is controlled by an enhancer.

225
00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:35.670
That's derived from a transposon murder 20 that invaded the mammalian genome

226
00:15:36.161 --> 00:15:37.810
when placentation evolved.

227
00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:43.200
So we're talking about something in the region of perhaps 90 to 120 million

228
00:15:43.391 --> 00:15:44.224
years ago.

229
00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:49.240
That insertion then rewired a large genetic network.

230
00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:53.560
When we look at the expression patterns,

231
00:15:53.561 --> 00:15:58.561
we can see that there are about 1,500 genes that were recruited into endometrial

232
00:15:58.931 --> 00:16:00.610
expression and placental mammals.

233
00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:05.760
13% of them are within about 200 kilobytes kilobases of murder 20 this

234
00:16:07.571 --> 00:16:08.380
transposon,

235
00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:12.520
which binds the transcription factors that are essential for pregnancy and

236
00:16:12.521 --> 00:16:17.521
regulates gene expression in response to progesterone and to see cyclic amp.

237
00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:24.420
So this is one way that an innovation can occur in evolution.

238
00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:30.330
A transpose on can come in and it is carrying with it a binding site for

239
00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:35.340
transcription factor and if that will insert upstream from a series of other

240
00:16:35.861 --> 00:16:36.341
genes,

241
00:16:36.341 --> 00:16:40.120
some of which can be cooled coating for transcription factors that results in

242
00:16:40.121 --> 00:16:42.060
the rewiring of a genetic network.

243
00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:45.711
So to summarize,

244
00:16:45.711 --> 00:16:50.610
the female reproductive tract develops under the control of the same genes that

245
00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:52.850
earlier had laid down in the body axis.

246
00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:56.630
This is an evolutionary innovation.

247
00:16:56.690 --> 00:16:59.960
It required the rewiring of a large genetic network,

248
00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:04.820
and some of the innovation was made possible by the insertion of a transposable

249
00:17:04.821 --> 00:17:08.540
element,
carrying receptors for transcription factors.
