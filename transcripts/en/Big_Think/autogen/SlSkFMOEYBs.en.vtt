00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:06.929
 
I think we need to get away from the

I think we need to get away from the
 

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:09.480
I think we need to get away from the
idea of leaving this to a small and

and spread the burden across the entire
 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:16.019
and spread the burden across the entire
scientific community I think all the

scientific community I think all the
 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:18.240
scientific community I think all the
sciences can contribute and I'll give

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:18.250
sciences can contribute and I'll give
 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.660

haven't they did civilizations spread

00:00:33.119 --> 00:00:33.129
haven't they did civilizations spread
 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:35.729
haven't they did civilizations spread
across the galaxy and colonized it or

everybody is the way Fermi put it and so

everybody is the way Fermi put it and so
he took that as evidence so there's

00:00:45.569 --> 00:00:45.579
he took that as evidence so there's
 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:47.310
he took that as evidence so there's
nobody out there the fact that that

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:47.320
nobody out there the fact that that
 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.830

either but I think I could put a spin on

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:56.710
either but I think I could put a spin on
 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.400
either but I think I could put a spin on
this particular story and say well how

00:00:59.400 --> 00:00:59.410
this particular story and say well how
 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.189
this particular story and say well how
do we know the aliens didn't come and it

00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:02.199
do we know the aliens didn't come and it
 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:03.389
do we know the aliens didn't come and it
doesn't have to be flesh and blood

that sort that they could well have come

that sort that they could well have come
a very long time ago and in this game

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:14.800
a very long time ago and in this game
 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.620
a very long time ago and in this game
you've got a thing not in thousands or

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630
you've got a thing not in thousands or
 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.480
you've got a thing not in thousands or
even millions of years but hundreds of

even millions of years but hundreds of
 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.219
even millions of years but hundreds of
millions or billions of years so it's

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:20.229
millions or billions of years so it's
 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:22.139
millions or billions of years so it's
that sort of timescale we have to think

00:01:22.139 --> 00:01:22.149
that sort of timescale we have to think
 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:24.419
that sort of timescale we have to think
on and the question is would any trace

00:01:24.419 --> 00:01:24.429
on and the question is would any trace
 

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:26.910
on and the question is would any trace
remain of alien activity say in our

out of midair or 100 million years you

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470
out of midair or 100 million years you
 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.350
out of midair or 100 million years you
came back in another 100 million years

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360
came back in another 100 million years
 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.229
came back in another 100 million years
from now would any trace of human human

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:37.239
from now would any trace of human human
 

00:01:37.239 --> 00:01:39.359
from now would any trace of human human
activity remain the answer is not very

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:39.369
activity remain the answer is not very
 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:40.859
activity remain the answer is not very
much but there are some things that we

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:40.869
much but there are some things that we
 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:43.380

the solar system obviously didn't didn't

stop for a hundred million years what we

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720
stop for a hundred million years what we
 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.740
stop for a hundred million years what we
find well there are some things like

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750
find well there are some things like
 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.839
find well there are some things like
nuclear waste if you dump nuclear waste

that will certainly survive for that

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229
that will certainly survive for that

survey we could look for that too and

then there's one other idea that's crazy

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:45.720
history so if viruses can do it et can
do it and it seems to me that we we

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730
do it and it seems to me that we we
 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.449
do it and it seems to me that we we
could in addition to scouring the skies

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459
could in addition to scouring the skies
 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:50.490
could in addition to scouring the skies
for radio waves with the message encoded

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500
for radio waves with the message encoded
 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.400
for radio waves with the message encoded
we could scour terrestrial genomes which

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410
we could scour terrestrial genomes which
 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:55.589
we could scour terrestrial genomes which
are being sequenced anyway to see if

00:03:55.589 --> 00:03:55.599
are being sequenced anyway to see if
 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:57.479
are being sequenced anyway to see if
there's a message from ET encoded in it

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:57.489
there's a message from ET encoded in it
 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:00.240
there's a message from ET encoded in it
you know could be some striking string

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250
you know could be some striking string
 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.330
you know could be some striking string
of nucleotide bases the famous a

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340
of nucleotide bases the famous a
 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.940
of nucleotide bases the famous a
four-letter alphabet that is the

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:05.950
four-letter alphabet that is the
 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.220
four-letter alphabet that is the
language of life the A's Jesus sees and

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230
language of life the A's Jesus sees and
 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.629
language of life the A's Jesus sees and
T's in the DNA might just spell out some

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:12.639
T's in the DNA might just spell out some
 

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:13.979
T's in the DNA might just spell out some
sort of message that would attract our

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989
sort of message that would attract our
 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:16.349
sort of message that would attract our
attention now of course this is a crazy

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359
attention now of course this is a crazy
 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:18.629
attention now of course this is a crazy
idea I'm not actually suggesting that

00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:18.639
idea I'm not actually suggesting that
 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:20.580
idea I'm not actually suggesting that
there really is a message from ET in

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590
there really is a message from ET in
 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.339
there really is a message from ET in
gene and what I'm saying is that's the

00:04:23.339 --> 00:04:23.349
gene and what I'm saying is that's the
 

00:04:23.349 --> 00:04:26.010
gene and what I'm saying is that's the
type of thinking we need and maybe it's

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020
type of thinking we need and maybe it's
 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.630
type of thinking we need and maybe it's
no more crazy than expecting it to be

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:27.640
no more crazy than expecting it to be
 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.730
no more crazy than expecting it to be
etched into radio waves coming from the

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740
etched into radio waves coming from the
 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.919
etched into radio waves coming from the
