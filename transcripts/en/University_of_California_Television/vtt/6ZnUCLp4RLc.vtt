00:00:05.831 --> 00:00:08.331
(piano music)

00:00:09.872 --> 00:00:12.605
- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape.

00:00:12.605 --> 00:00:13.888
Bipedal.

00:00:13.888 --> 00:00:15.140
Naked.

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:16.140
Large brain.

00:00:17.826 --> 00:00:21.882
Long the master of fire,
tools, and language.

00:00:21.882 --> 00:00:25.299
But still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:26.163 --> 00:00:29.482
Aware that death is inevitable,

00:00:29.482 --> 00:00:31.565
yet filled with optimism.

00:00:32.803 --> 00:00:34.303
We grow up slowly.

00:00:35.215 --> 00:00:37.723
We hand down knowledge.

00:00:37.723 --> 00:00:39.806
We empathize and deceive.

00:00:41.167 --> 00:00:44.101
We shape the future from
our shared understanding

00:00:44.101 --> 00:00:45.101
of the past.

00:00:46.615 --> 00:00:50.418
CARTA brings together experts
from diverse disciplines

00:00:50.418 --> 00:00:54.585
to exchange insights on who
we are and how we got here.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.321
An exploration made possible
by the generosity of humans

00:01:00.321 --> 00:01:01.154
like you.

00:01:22.458 --> 00:01:25.375
(electronic music)

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:32.119
(upbeat, bubbly music)

00:01:41.821 --> 00:01:44.917
- So yes, I'm going to talk you primarily,

00:01:44.917 --> 00:01:47.656
I'm going to start with a
discussion about what fear is

00:01:47.656 --> 00:01:52.639
because my views on this have
crystallized in recent years.

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:56.168
And if you know anything about what I do,

00:01:56.168 --> 00:01:58.479
you probably don't really know what I do

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:03.353
because it's been misrepresented
quite a bit over the years.

00:02:03.353 --> 00:02:06.686
So, fear, I think most of us will agree,

00:02:07.984 --> 00:02:11.705
is an awareness that there's
a threat to well-being

00:02:11.705 --> 00:02:13.536
that's present or eminent.

00:02:13.536 --> 00:02:16.699
And this can be in the form
of these kinds of biological

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:20.955
or social cues that have the
potential to cause us harm.

00:02:20.955 --> 00:02:23.933
And when we encounter these
kinds of threatening events

00:02:23.933 --> 00:02:27.184
a lot of things happen
in our brains and bodies

00:02:27.184 --> 00:02:29.799
that some of them are
recognizable by others,

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:32.848
and that's how we judge someone else

00:02:32.848 --> 00:02:34.432
as being fearful or anxious,

00:02:34.432 --> 00:02:35.943
but others are more internal

00:02:35.943 --> 00:02:38.252
and we can only judge
in ourselves in terms

00:02:38.252 --> 00:02:39.752
of body responses.

00:02:41.542 --> 00:02:43.737
Of course we can measure these objectively

00:02:43.737 --> 00:02:45.295
if we hook a person up to

00:02:45.295 --> 00:02:47.284
some sort of physiological recording.

00:02:47.284 --> 00:02:51.731
But the most important part
of fear is the internal

00:02:51.731 --> 00:02:54.553
awareness that you're in danger.

00:02:54.553 --> 00:02:58.284
Now, the traditional view
of how this comes about,

00:02:58.284 --> 00:03:01.000
and I'm partly responsible for this,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.773
is that this part of the
brain called the amygdala,

00:03:04.773 --> 00:03:07.729
which you heard about a bit earlier,

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:09.593
is a fear center.

00:03:09.593 --> 00:03:14.497
That is a view that is
widely cast in the culture

00:03:14.497 --> 00:03:17.289
and the scientific circles as well.

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:19.927
The idea is that the
threat in the outside world

00:03:19.927 --> 00:03:22.205
is processed by sensory systems

00:03:22.205 --> 00:03:23.947
that reaches the amygdala,

00:03:23.947 --> 00:03:25.661
it arouses the state of fear

00:03:25.661 --> 00:03:27.599
and fear causes these behavioral

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:29.636
and physiological responses.

00:03:29.636 --> 00:03:32.491
Now, when I talked about fear

00:03:32.491 --> 00:03:34.087
as being involved in the amygdala,

00:03:34.087 --> 00:03:37.064
which I've done for almost 30 years now,

00:03:37.064 --> 00:03:39.576
the idea was that what
the amygdala was doing

00:03:39.576 --> 00:03:41.635
was processing implicitly,

00:03:41.635 --> 00:03:44.292
or non-consciously, threats

00:03:44.292 --> 00:03:46.857
and that the conscious
experience of fear was coming

00:03:46.857 --> 00:03:48.746
about through a different mechanism

00:03:48.746 --> 00:03:51.275
which I proposed was in the neocortex

00:03:51.275 --> 00:03:53.542
and I'll describe that in a bit later.

00:03:53.542 --> 00:03:55.709
But what got carried forth

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:00.237
in the scientific and lay culture is that

00:04:00.237 --> 00:04:03.413
I said that fear is in the amygdala.

00:04:03.413 --> 00:04:05.172
And I think that this is wrong.

00:04:05.172 --> 00:04:06.924
And that's what I want to

00:04:06.924 --> 00:04:08.382
help clarify as we move forward today.

00:04:08.382 --> 00:04:09.714
So, what's wrong with the idea?

00:04:09.714 --> 00:04:13.254
Well the idea is based on
two kinds of observations,

00:04:13.254 --> 00:04:16.421
one is that when a person or an animal

00:04:17.815 --> 00:04:21.103
has some problem with their amygdala

00:04:21.103 --> 00:04:25.437
they no longer respond to
threats in the way that

00:04:25.437 --> 00:04:26.562
you can measure,

00:04:26.562 --> 00:04:28.817
like behaviorally or physiologically.

00:04:28.817 --> 00:04:32.150
And secondly, when an animal or human is

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:35.860
exposed to a threat,

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.799
activity increases in the amygdala.

00:04:37.799 --> 00:04:39.776
So these two things kind of suggest

00:04:39.776 --> 00:04:41.876
that the amygdala's processing threats

00:04:41.876 --> 00:04:44.284
and that has led to the
conclusion that the amygdala

00:04:44.284 --> 00:04:46.202
is the source of fear.

00:04:46.202 --> 00:04:49.234
But that I think is a leap
that's too far to make.

00:04:49.234 --> 00:04:52.460
So, why is that a leap that's too far?

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.295
Well behavioral and
physiological responses

00:04:55.295 --> 00:04:58.368
don't always correlate with subjectively

00:04:58.368 --> 00:05:00.387
reported experiences of fear.

00:05:00.387 --> 00:05:02.331
Medications that are used to treat fear

00:05:02.331 --> 00:05:03.921
or an anxiety

00:05:03.921 --> 00:05:05.649
are more likely to change
behavioral responses

00:05:05.649 --> 00:05:07.756
like avoidance or timidity

00:05:07.756 --> 00:05:10.964
and physiological responses
like hyperarousal,

00:05:10.964 --> 00:05:13.422
than the subjective feeling of fear.

00:05:13.422 --> 00:05:16.178
And as a result of point two, there,

00:05:16.178 --> 00:05:18.669
all the major drug
companies are pulling out

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:19.847
of the anti-fear,

00:05:19.847 --> 00:05:21.764
anti-anxiety medication business

00:05:21.764 --> 00:05:23.856
because they view the results

00:05:23.856 --> 00:05:25.939
of efforts to develop new

00:05:27.288 --> 00:05:30.162
and better treatments as a failure.

00:05:30.162 --> 00:05:33.254
They don't consider a
reduction in behavior

00:05:33.254 --> 00:05:34.839
and physiology a success

00:05:34.839 --> 00:05:37.035
because the patient doesn't feel

00:05:37.035 --> 00:05:38.447
less fearful or anxious.

00:05:38.447 --> 00:05:40.213
So, the therapist is disappointed,

00:05:40.213 --> 00:05:42.302
the patient is disappointed,

00:05:42.302 --> 00:05:45.066
and the drug companies are disappointed.

00:05:45.066 --> 00:05:46.696
So, number three,

00:05:46.696 --> 00:05:48.640
threats elicit amygdala activity

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.763
and behavioral and physiological responses

00:05:50.763 --> 00:05:53.078
in the absence of subjective awareness

00:05:53.078 --> 00:05:54.419
that the stimulus exist.

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:58.570
As in, Nick Humphrey's famous
blind sight situations,

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:01.240
in human rather than monkeys though.

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.344
And without any feeling of fear.

00:06:03.344 --> 00:06:06.335
So, this could be done
through studies of blind sight

00:06:06.335 --> 00:06:10.505
but also through studies
of so-called subliminal

00:06:10.505 --> 00:06:12.711
presentations of stimuli.

00:06:12.711 --> 00:06:14.829
Where stimuli are presented very briefly

00:06:14.829 --> 00:06:17.210
or masked by some other kind of stimulus.

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:18.680
The stimulus is present.

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:20.244
It's a threat.

00:06:20.244 --> 00:06:21.941
The person doesn't feel fear

00:06:21.941 --> 00:06:24.025
and yet the amygdala is still activated

00:06:24.025 --> 00:06:26.191
and the responses are still expressed.

00:06:26.191 --> 00:06:29.775
Fear is not the cause of those responses.

00:06:29.775 --> 00:06:34.254
And finally, in the damage
to the amygdala in a human

00:06:34.254 --> 00:06:37.014
eliminates the behavioral
and physiological responses

00:06:37.014 --> 00:06:39.910
but not subjective feelings of fear.

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:41.449
So, all of this, to me,

00:06:41.449 --> 00:06:43.963
suggests that fear is not
coming out of the amygdala

00:06:43.963 --> 00:06:45.998
but some place else.

00:06:45.998 --> 00:06:49.618
So, I will put an X through
this fear circuit view

00:06:49.618 --> 00:06:53.785
and I first want to redefine
what the amygdala does.

00:06:55.533 --> 00:06:58.791
I think one way to describe it that is

00:06:58.791 --> 00:07:00.375
semantically more neutral

00:07:00.375 --> 00:07:03.708
and doesn't imply that fear is emerging,

00:07:04.912 --> 00:07:06.522
bubbling up out of the amygdala,

00:07:06.522 --> 00:07:09.391
is to simply call it a
defensive survival circuit.

00:07:09.391 --> 00:07:12.048
Every animal has to detect
and respond to danger,

00:07:12.048 --> 00:07:13.490
as we heard about birds

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:16.253
being able to detect
and respond to danger.

00:07:16.253 --> 00:07:18.676
And I was happy to hear that
fear didn't come up there.

00:07:18.676 --> 00:07:22.865
It was described as responses
to danger and threat.

00:07:22.865 --> 00:07:24.055
So every animal,

00:07:24.055 --> 00:07:25.052
from a worm to a human,

00:07:25.052 --> 00:07:26.842
has to be able to detect

00:07:26.842 --> 00:07:28.844
and respond to danger
in order to stay alive.

00:07:28.844 --> 00:07:31.975
Even bacterial cells have to
detect and respond to danger.

00:07:31.975 --> 00:07:34.383
So the detecting, responding to danger

00:07:34.383 --> 00:07:36.832
has nothing to do with psychology.

00:07:36.832 --> 00:07:38.377
It's there to keep the organism alive.

00:07:38.377 --> 00:07:41.054
And if you have some kind of psychology

00:07:41.054 --> 00:07:42.969
because of the kind of brain you have

00:07:42.969 --> 00:07:45.096
then you become aware
that you're in danger

00:07:45.096 --> 00:07:46.962
and you experience fear.

00:07:46.962 --> 00:07:50.477
So, threats activate the
defensive survival circuit

00:07:50.477 --> 00:07:53.295
but that non-consciously
controls defensive responses

00:07:53.295 --> 00:07:55.129
and humans have inherited this

00:07:55.129 --> 00:07:56.552
defensive survival circuit from animals

00:07:56.552 --> 00:08:00.716
but not the conscious experience of fear.

00:08:00.716 --> 00:08:02.732
So if the amygdala's
not the source of fear,

00:08:02.732 --> 00:08:04.157
how does it come about?

00:08:04.157 --> 00:08:05.804
I have to say it comes about

00:08:05.804 --> 00:08:06.862
like any other conscious experience.

00:08:06.862 --> 00:08:09.078
And we might argue about
how that comes about.

00:08:09.078 --> 00:08:10.617
And there are some experts in the room

00:08:10.617 --> 00:08:11.700
that may not agree with me

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:14.778
but my own position is that

00:08:14.778 --> 00:08:16.545
once we understand consciousness,

00:08:16.545 --> 00:08:19.050
we'll get an understanding
of emotions for free.

00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:21.567
(crowd laughs)

00:08:21.567 --> 00:08:23.945
So my shot at it is something like this.

00:08:23.945 --> 00:08:26.700
Which is an idea that really started

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:30.816
when I was doing split
brain work in the 1970's

00:08:30.816 --> 00:08:32.543
as a graduate student.

00:08:32.543 --> 00:08:35.433
And I won't go into that
but the idea is that,

00:08:35.433 --> 00:08:37.876
and I proposed this model in 1984

00:08:37.876 --> 00:08:40.336
before I did any research on fear itself,

00:08:40.336 --> 00:08:42.915
but the basic idea is that
threat comes into the brain

00:08:42.915 --> 00:08:45.490
and it's processed through
different kinds of channels.

00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:47.604
There are connections from sensory systems

00:08:47.604 --> 00:08:50.129
into this defensive survival
circuit that control

00:08:50.129 --> 00:08:53.015
these behavioral and
physiological responses

00:08:53.015 --> 00:08:55.393
and then to cortical areas,

00:08:55.393 --> 00:08:58.056
where you have processes like attention

00:08:58.056 --> 00:09:00.575
and working memory that
can put things together

00:09:00.575 --> 00:09:02.477
and hold them in mind.

00:09:02.477 --> 00:09:05.256
And one of the things that can be added

00:09:05.256 --> 00:09:08.023
into working memory is the fact that

00:09:08.023 --> 00:09:10.317
this defensive survival circuit is active

00:09:10.317 --> 00:09:13.194
and that you're getting feedback
from the body and so forth,

00:09:13.194 --> 00:09:16.131
and all this kind of coalesces in the mind

00:09:16.131 --> 00:09:17.776
to make fear a cognitive event.

00:09:17.776 --> 00:09:21.910
Not an innate feeling inherited
from animal ancestors.

00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:24.416
So, I'm not saying that animals have

00:09:24.416 --> 00:09:27.117
no conscious experiences,

00:09:27.117 --> 00:09:28.114
no subjective experiences
of fear or anxiety,

00:09:28.114 --> 00:09:29.397
or anything like that,

00:09:29.397 --> 00:09:31.380
but if they do they're
probably very different

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:34.547
from the kinds of experiences we have.

00:09:36.448 --> 00:09:39.531
So why is this kind of theory needed?

00:09:41.403 --> 00:09:42.595
For one reason,

00:09:42.595 --> 00:09:45.625
fear doesn't have an exclusive
contract with the amygdala,

00:09:45.625 --> 00:09:47.782
which is generally thought to be

00:09:47.782 --> 00:09:50.663
a kind of predatory defense system.

00:09:50.663 --> 00:09:51.769
We can be afraid,

00:09:51.769 --> 00:09:53.110
we can have fear,

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:54.487
from starvation,

00:09:54.487 --> 00:09:55.339
dehydration,

00:09:55.339 --> 00:09:56.385
hypothermia,

00:09:56.385 --> 00:09:58.019
reproductive isolation,

00:09:58.019 --> 00:10:00.854
each of which depends on
other survival circuits.

00:10:00.854 --> 00:10:04.413
So, the key is not that
the amygdala is activated

00:10:04.413 --> 00:10:06.782
but that you have some kind of activity

00:10:06.782 --> 00:10:08.931
that threatens your existence,

00:10:08.931 --> 00:10:11.735
or potentially causes you harm.

00:10:11.735 --> 00:10:13.522
So, what we feel depends on

00:10:13.522 --> 00:10:16.452
what kinds of signals are being
processed in working memory,

00:10:16.452 --> 00:10:19.046
Including signals from survival circuits

00:10:19.046 --> 00:10:21.884
but other signals as well.

00:10:21.884 --> 00:10:25.939
So rather than having a
kind of subcortical circuit,

00:10:25.939 --> 00:10:28.477
one for each kind of basic emotion,

00:10:28.477 --> 00:10:31.363
I purpose that the cortical cognitive,

00:10:31.363 --> 00:10:33.572
high-order, representation

00:10:33.572 --> 00:10:36.313
of information accounts for emotional

00:10:36.313 --> 00:10:39.897
and non-emotional experiences
in one kind of basic system.

00:10:39.897 --> 00:10:42.022
And I won't have time
to go into any of the

00:10:42.022 --> 00:10:43.522
evidence for all of this right now

00:10:43.522 --> 00:10:46.053
but I'd like to make it--

00:10:46.053 --> 00:10:49.743
analogize it by explaining
how you make soup.

00:10:49.743 --> 00:10:50.869
Which you all know.

00:10:50.869 --> 00:10:52.712
You take water, onions, garlic, carrots,

00:10:52.712 --> 00:10:54.216
all kinds of ingredients,

00:10:54.216 --> 00:10:55.592
put them into the pot,

00:10:55.592 --> 00:10:58.161
and none of these are soup ingredients.

00:10:58.161 --> 00:11:00.216
They're things that exist in nature that,

00:11:00.216 --> 00:11:01.924
when combined in a certain way,

00:11:01.924 --> 00:11:03.016
make soup.

00:11:03.016 --> 00:11:04.497
And I think emotions
are like this as well.

00:11:04.497 --> 00:11:07.154
We have lots of things in our brain

00:11:07.154 --> 00:11:08.660
that are there for various reasons,

00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:09.835
like sensory processing,

00:11:09.835 --> 00:11:11.138
survival circuits,

00:11:11.138 --> 00:11:12.361
brain arousal,

00:11:12.361 --> 00:11:13.336
body feedback,

00:11:13.336 --> 00:11:14.169
attention,

00:11:14.169 --> 00:11:15.002
semantic memory,

00:11:15.002 --> 00:11:15.964
episodic memory,

00:11:15.964 --> 00:11:17.121
implicit fear schema,

00:11:17.121 --> 00:11:18.079
monitoring,

00:11:18.079 --> 00:11:19.281
awareness that you are in danger,

00:11:19.281 --> 00:11:20.330
interpretation.

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:23.516
Most of these have nothing
to do with fear or emotion.

00:11:23.516 --> 00:11:25.917
They're simply things that exist

00:11:25.917 --> 00:11:29.167
to allow you to accomplish other goals.

00:11:30.726 --> 00:11:33.548
So, when you put them
together in a particular way,

00:11:33.548 --> 00:11:36.123
fear is what results.

00:11:36.123 --> 00:11:38.823
Now, this kind of re-schematizes all this.

00:11:38.823 --> 00:11:42.115
On the left side of the diagram,

00:11:42.115 --> 00:11:43.817
we have things that would be contributing

00:11:43.817 --> 00:11:45.020
to regular old conscious experience,

00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:46.332
non-emotional states.

00:11:46.332 --> 00:11:47.697
And on the right side,

00:11:47.697 --> 00:11:49.565
there are ingredients
that begin to tilt it

00:11:49.565 --> 00:11:52.077
into a kind of emotional direction.

00:11:52.077 --> 00:11:57.019
And you can see the survival
circuit multiplicity there

00:11:57.019 --> 00:12:00.410
that can generate activity
that will help tilt it

00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:02.410
in one way or the other.

00:12:03.836 --> 00:12:06.918
There are a couple of important things

00:12:06.918 --> 00:12:07.751
on this I want to point out.

00:12:07.751 --> 00:12:10.830
On the two sides of the
vertical line there,

00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:13.082
Self schema and emotion schema.

00:12:13.082 --> 00:12:15.623
I think these are both very important.

00:12:15.623 --> 00:12:19.282
Unless you have an
awareness that the danger

00:12:19.282 --> 00:12:21.285
is happening to you,

00:12:21.285 --> 00:12:23.239
there's no fear or any
other kind of emotion.

00:12:23.239 --> 00:12:25.931
In order to be emotional,

00:12:25.931 --> 00:12:28.026
you have to realize that it's you

00:12:28.026 --> 00:12:31.161
that is experiencing the situation.

00:12:31.161 --> 00:12:34.622
A threat might cause you
to respond in a certain way

00:12:34.622 --> 00:12:36.650
but if you don't know that
it's happening to you,

00:12:36.650 --> 00:12:38.438
you're not afraid.

00:12:38.438 --> 00:12:40.481
Now, you might say

00:12:40.481 --> 00:12:43.353
well, I can be afraid or
worried about my children

00:12:43.353 --> 00:12:44.459
if I see them in danger

00:12:44.459 --> 00:12:47.539
but your children are in
effect part of who you are.

00:12:47.539 --> 00:12:50.011
As are the, William James says,

00:12:50.011 --> 00:12:52.938
a man's yacht is part of who he is.

00:12:52.938 --> 00:12:54.882
(crowd laughs)

00:12:54.882 --> 00:12:58.299
I would be very unhappy
if I lost my guitar

00:12:58.299 --> 00:13:02.050
because it is such an
important part of who I am.

00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:04.400
So, I think self schema, very important.

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:06.217
But also, emotion schema.

00:13:06.217 --> 00:13:08.275
As the child begins to grow up

00:13:08.275 --> 00:13:10.150
and experience the world

00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:12.783
and come across dangerous situations,

00:13:12.783 --> 00:13:14.103
they're told what danger is,

00:13:14.103 --> 00:13:16.000
they may experience danger themselves,

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.357
they observe it on TV and in movies,

00:13:18.357 --> 00:13:21.014
They build up these
schemas about danger is

00:13:21.014 --> 00:13:22.651
and when fear occurs.

00:13:22.651 --> 00:13:26.275
So that, when you you
have these kinds of schema

00:13:26.275 --> 00:13:28.961
it's very easy to pattern
complete the entire

00:13:28.961 --> 00:13:31.428
representation of what
fear is with just a few

00:13:31.428 --> 00:13:33.724
or maybe even one element.

00:13:33.724 --> 00:13:35.361
If a threat is present,

00:13:35.361 --> 00:13:36.861
you're probably moving toward

00:13:36.861 --> 00:13:39.181
a cognitive pattern completion

00:13:39.181 --> 00:13:42.500
that the situation is one in
which you are feeling fear.

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:44.565
Add in the fact that
escape is not possible

00:13:44.565 --> 00:13:46.931
and that your heart is
beating fast, and so forth,

00:13:46.931 --> 00:13:47.764
and bingo.

00:13:47.764 --> 00:13:50.138
You've got the whole thing close up.

00:13:50.138 --> 00:13:52.229
So the idea that emotions are
cognitively assembled states

00:13:52.229 --> 00:13:55.732
made by the information
available in working memory

00:13:55.732 --> 00:13:58.997
is related to Levi Strauss's
notion of bricolage.

00:13:58.997 --> 00:14:02.415
In french this means
to put things together,

00:14:02.415 --> 00:14:04.035
items that happen to be available.

00:14:04.035 --> 00:14:06.056
He emphasized the importance
of the individual,

00:14:06.056 --> 00:14:07.266
the bricoleur,

00:14:07.266 --> 00:14:10.393
and the social context in
the construction process.

00:14:10.393 --> 00:14:13.758
Others note that maybe
persons, objects, contexts,

00:14:13.758 --> 00:14:15.776
the sequence and fabric of everyday life

00:14:15.776 --> 00:14:18.189
are the medium through which
emotions come into being,

00:14:18.189 --> 00:14:20.965
a day to day kind of emotional bricolage.

00:14:20.965 --> 00:14:22.544
In the brain,

00:14:22.544 --> 00:14:24.031
working memory can be
thought of as the bricoleur,

00:14:24.031 --> 00:14:27.334
and the content of emotional
consciousness as the bricolage.

00:14:27.334 --> 00:14:30.789
So, if emotions are
cognitive events in circuits

00:14:30.789 --> 00:14:32.943
that differ in significant ways in humans

00:14:32.943 --> 00:14:34.085
and other animals,

00:14:34.085 --> 00:14:35.657
including other primates,

00:14:35.657 --> 00:14:37.240
than emotions we experience,

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:39.940
including emotions related
to death may be unique

00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:42.726
and unparalleled in the animal kingdom.

00:14:42.726 --> 00:14:45.328
Add language and culture
to the emotional equation

00:14:45.328 --> 00:14:47.149
and the case strengthens.

00:14:47.149 --> 00:14:48.963
So, animals may have
subjective experiences

00:14:48.963 --> 00:14:51.458
but can't have the kinds
of experiences we have.

00:14:51.458 --> 00:14:54.489
Or at least, that's how I think about it.

00:14:54.489 --> 00:14:57.755
So, second part of my title is,

00:14:57.755 --> 00:14:59.755
Is fear of death a fear?

00:15:01.398 --> 00:15:03.909
Fear formally defined as
the awareness that a threat

00:15:03.909 --> 00:15:05.931
to your well-being is present.

00:15:05.931 --> 00:15:09.187
Anxiety is the expectation
of worry that your well-being

00:15:09.187 --> 00:15:11.295
may be compromised in the future.

00:15:11.295 --> 00:15:15.140
Many situations described as
fears are really anxieties.

00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:17.552
But fear and anxiety are
really conjoined twins.

00:15:17.552 --> 00:15:20.279
Even in a clear case of bodily threat,

00:15:20.279 --> 00:15:23.337
fear quickly morphs into
worry about the future.

00:15:23.337 --> 00:15:25.960
A snake at your feet causes you to freeze

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:28.304
and feel fear of bodily harm

00:15:28.304 --> 00:15:30.245
but that's soon complimented,

00:15:30.245 --> 00:15:32.759
if not overtaken by worries
about what will happen

00:15:32.759 --> 00:15:33.707
if you are bitten.

00:15:33.707 --> 00:15:34.902
Will you die?

00:15:34.902 --> 00:15:37.027
Will you get to the
emergency room in time?

00:15:37.027 --> 00:15:38.215
Will they have the antidote?

00:15:38.215 --> 00:15:39.534
And so forth.

00:15:39.534 --> 00:15:41.047
And death is always in the future,

00:15:41.047 --> 00:15:44.713
so it's a worry or an
anxiety rather than a fear.

00:15:44.713 --> 00:15:48.949
Fear and anxiety are products
of the same cortical system

00:15:48.949 --> 00:15:50.174
in my theory.

00:15:50.174 --> 00:15:52.091
But different subcortical circuits

00:15:52.091 --> 00:15:55.096
are part of what makes
fear and anxiety different.

00:15:55.096 --> 00:15:57.253
Specifically, subcortical
circuits underlying

00:15:57.253 --> 00:16:00.201
the processing and control
of bodily responses

00:16:00.201 --> 00:16:02.552
related to immediate or certain threats

00:16:02.552 --> 00:16:05.461
versus future and uncertain
threats are different.

00:16:05.461 --> 00:16:09.920
In the case of the
immediately present threat

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:11.593
the amygdala's very important.

00:16:11.593 --> 00:16:13.454
In the case of a future threat,

00:16:13.454 --> 00:16:16.152
an area called the bed nucleus
of the stria terminalis

00:16:16.152 --> 00:16:17.594
is important.

00:16:17.594 --> 00:16:21.865
Now, the bed nucleus
has become for anxiety,

00:16:21.865 --> 00:16:25.152
what the amygdala is for fear.

00:16:25.152 --> 00:16:29.081
It's been viewed as the source
of anxiety but it's not.

00:16:29.081 --> 00:16:30.644
Like the amygdala,

00:16:30.644 --> 00:16:32.788
the text then responds to threats.

00:16:32.788 --> 00:16:34.569
In this case threats in the future.

00:16:34.569 --> 00:16:37.350
Fear and anxiety are the
cognitive interpretation

00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:40.714
that these things are happening.

00:16:40.714 --> 00:16:43.744
So, what does it matter
what we call thees things?

00:16:43.744 --> 00:16:45.517
First of all,

00:16:45.517 --> 00:16:47.575
why does it matter what
we call fear and anxiety?

00:16:47.575 --> 00:16:48.854
Why can't we just use one word

00:16:48.854 --> 00:16:52.036
and maybe even just use
them interchangeably?

00:16:52.036 --> 00:16:53.544
For one reason,

00:16:53.544 --> 00:16:57.711
the problems that afflict people
that have these conditions

00:17:00.163 --> 00:17:01.875
need to be treated differently

00:17:01.875 --> 00:17:05.629
if the threat is a worry
about the future as opposed to

00:17:05.629 --> 00:17:08.533
a kind of over sensitivity

00:17:08.533 --> 00:17:10.608
to an immediately present stimulant.

00:17:10.608 --> 00:17:13.988
But in the case of fear of death,

00:17:13.988 --> 00:17:15.721
or anxiety about death,

00:17:15.721 --> 00:17:18.181
the imprecision in scientific terminology,

00:17:18.181 --> 00:17:20.507
while a constant problem,

00:17:20.507 --> 00:17:22.273
it can easily be avoided by being

00:17:22.273 --> 00:17:24.564
clearer about the language.

00:17:24.564 --> 00:17:26.533
So in treating someone, say,

00:17:26.533 --> 00:17:28.626
who is obsessed with death,

00:17:28.626 --> 00:17:32.022
or in designing treatments
that might help people

00:17:32.022 --> 00:17:33.541
who are at the end of life

00:17:33.541 --> 00:17:37.541
and needing to not be
quite as anxious about it,

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:40.328
thinking about these things in terms

00:17:40.328 --> 00:17:42.492
of what's going on in the brain

00:17:42.492 --> 00:17:44.332
can actually be more constructive

00:17:44.332 --> 00:17:48.059
than simply assuming that it
all happens in the same way.
