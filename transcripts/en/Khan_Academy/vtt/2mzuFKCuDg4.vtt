00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:02.974
Match these angles
with their measures.

00:00:02.974 --> 00:00:04.765
There should be one
angle in each category.

00:00:04.765 --> 00:00:08.720
We have 30 degrees, 60 degrees,
90 degrees, and 180 degrees.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.720
So there's a few that are
very easy to spot out.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:16.110
This angle right over here,
it makes a complete line.

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:19.170
So this is clearly 180 degrees.

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.794
So this one's 180 degrees.

00:00:20.794 --> 00:00:22.460
The other one that
might jump out at you

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:23.626
is this one right over here.

00:00:23.626 --> 00:00:27.420
This is clearly a right
angle, or a 90-degree angle

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.140
right over here.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.887
So this is 90 degrees.

00:00:29.887 --> 00:00:31.720
And so we have to think
which of these is 30

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.110
and which is 60 degrees?

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:34.610
Well, just by
comparing it that way,

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.318
you know that the one
that opens out more

00:00:36.318 --> 00:00:38.800
is going to be 60 degrees and
the one that opens out less

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.450
is going to be 30 degrees.

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.530
And you can see that
this, the opening here,

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.160
is half the size of the
opening right over here.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.700
So it makes sense that
this is 30, this is 60,

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.610
and it also makes sense
that this angle is 1/3

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.830
the measure of this
angle right over here,

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:57.860
that this is 90 degrees.

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.520
And then if you
were to double this,

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.040
then this part of the angle
would go all the way out,

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.544
and you would get
to the 180 degrees.

00:01:06.544 --> 00:01:07.960
So let's check our
answer and make

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.210
sure we actually
got this one right.

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.290
Let's do one more, just for fun.

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.950
Which of these angles has
a measure of 60 degrees?

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.600
So there's a couple that we
can immediately rule out.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.530
This angle here is clearly
more than 90 degrees.

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.220
It's an obtuse angle.

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.830
This angle here is
180 degrees, so we're

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.840
going to have to pick
between these two.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.950
And we can assume that
these are all at scale.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.500
So if we know that a right angle
would have this line straight

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.260
up and down, this looks like
it's 2/3 of the way there.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.394
So I would go with this
one right over there.

00:01:41.394 --> 00:01:43.310
Now, you might say, well,
what about this one?

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.960
Well, this one looks like it's
about 1/3 of a right angle.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.022
If we were to do
2/3, then 3/3, it

00:01:48.022 --> 00:01:49.730
looks like we would
get to a right angle.

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.635
So this one looks much
closer to 30 degrees.

00:01:52.635 --> 00:01:54.510
So which of these angles
has a measure of 60?

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:55.430
That one right over there.

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.638
You could immediately rule
out that one and that one,

00:01:57.638 --> 00:02:00.690
and then these take a little
bit closer inspection.
