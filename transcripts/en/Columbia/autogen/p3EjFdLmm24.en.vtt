people have told themselves that and so

people have told themselves that and so
therefore they think the proper approach

00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:07.840
therefore they think the proper approach
 

00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:10.410
therefore they think the proper approach
is one of trying to manage or contain

and large that was the approach of

00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:20.140

about 1973 with maybe a few exceptions
 

00:19:27.130 --> 00:19:29.640
about 1973 with maybe a few exceptions
and then there are moments when we think

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:29.650
and then there are moments when we think
 

00:19:29.650 --> 00:19:32.820
and then there are moments when we think
the issue is so important that we need

00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:32.830
the issue is so important that we need
 

00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:35.400
the issue is so important that we need

it or at least moderate the intensity of
 

00:19:42.130 --> 00:19:43.919
it or at least moderate the intensity of
it and i would say that from about

it and i would say that from about
 

00:19:43.929 --> 00:19:46.110
it and i would say that from about
nineteen seventy three to two thousand

the two strongest military powers they
 

00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:20.970
the two strongest military powers they
both receive American arms and therefore

it's very difficult for them to go to

it's very difficult for them to go to
 

00:40:22.390 --> 00:40:24.059

important questions but we need to go
 

00:41:36.450 --> 00:41:39.530
important questions but we need to go
down to the foundations and we need to

Israel's security border and that is the
 

00:42:27.690 --> 00:42:30.260
Israel's security border and that is the
massing of Israel's existential

while there's broad support in the

Israeli side for an interim agreement
there's only one slight problem and that

00:49:17.830 --> 00:49:17.840
there's only one slight problem and that
 

00:49:17.840 --> 00:49:19.240
there's only one slight problem and that
is there's no support on the Palestinian

00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:19.250
is there's no support on the Palestinian
 

00:49:19.250 --> 00:49:22.540
is there's no support on the Palestinian
side for an interim agreement and Israel

00:49:22.540 --> 00:49:22.550
side for an interim agreement and Israel
 

00:49:22.550 --> 00:49:24.670
side for an interim agreement and Israel
and Palestinians actually have similar

00:49:24.670 --> 00:49:24.680
and Palestinians actually have similar
 

00:49:24.680 --> 00:49:26.560
and Palestinians actually have similar
concerns Israelis who are against an

concerns Israelis who are against an
 

00:49:26.570 --> 00:49:28.300
concerns Israelis who are against an
interim agreement fear that Israel will

00:49:28.300 --> 00:49:28.310
interim agreement fear that Israel will
 

00:49:28.310 --> 00:49:31.030
interim agreement fear that Israel will
be giving up its cards which our

00:49:31.030 --> 00:49:31.040
be giving up its cards which our
 

00:49:31.040 --> 00:49:33.700
be giving up its cards which our
territory and therefore would be in a

00:49:33.700 --> 00:49:33.710
territory and therefore would be in a
 

00:49:33.710 --> 00:49:35.230
territory and therefore would be in a
weaker position in permanent status and

00:49:35.230 --> 00:49:35.240
weaker position in permanent status and
 

00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:37.120
weaker position in permanent status and
the Palestinians are concerned that an

00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:37.130
the Palestinians are concerned that an
 

00:49:37.130 --> 00:49:38.470
the Palestinians are concerned that an
interim agreement will be a final

00:49:38.470 --> 00:49:38.480
interim agreement will be a final
 

00:49:38.480 --> 00:49:40.210
interim agreement will be a final
agreement and they will get trapped into

00:49:40.210 --> 00:49:40.220
agreement and they will get trapped into
 

00:49:40.220 --> 00:49:42.640
agreement and they will get trapped into
that and they will not get what they

00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:42.650
that and they will not get what they
 

00:49:42.650 --> 00:49:44.800
that and they will not get what they
feel they deserve my own view is that

00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:44.810
feel they deserve my own view is that
 

00:49:44.810 --> 00:49:47.920
feel they deserve my own view is that
those two issues in a sense balance each

00:49:47.920 --> 00:49:47.930
those two issues in a sense balance each
 

00:49:47.930 --> 00:49:50.200
those two issues in a sense balance each
other out those concerns that have a

00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:50.210
other out those concerns that have a
 

00:49:50.210 --> 00:49:52.600
other out those concerns that have a
certain balance and that therefore they

00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:52.610
certain balance and that therefore they
 

00:49:52.610 --> 00:49:54.460
certain balance and that therefore they
that that needn't be essentially a

00:49:54.460 --> 00:49:54.470
that that needn't be essentially a
 

00:49:54.470 --> 00:49:56.830
that that needn't be essentially a
problem my sense is that the

00:49:56.830 --> 00:49:56.840
problem my sense is that the
 

00:49:56.840 --> 00:49:58.540
problem my sense is that the
conversations going on right now between

00:49:58.540 --> 00:49:58.550
conversations going on right now between
 

00:49:58.550 --> 00:50:00.430
conversations going on right now between
the Israeli government and Dennis Ross

00:50:00.430 --> 00:50:00.440
the Israeli government and Dennis Ross
 

00:50:00.440 --> 00:50:01.750
the Israeli government and Dennis Ross
are quite important

00:50:01.750 --> 00:50:01.760
are quite important
 

00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:04.750
are quite important
and that they may well be about this

00:50:04.750 --> 00:50:04.760
and that they may well be about this
 

00:50:04.760 --> 00:50:08.020
and that they may well be about this
interim idea and my sense is if that

00:50:08.020 --> 00:50:08.030
interim idea and my sense is if that
 

00:50:08.030 --> 00:50:10.170
interim idea and my sense is if that
Israel was to put on the table a

00:50:10.170 --> 00:50:10.180
Israel was to put on the table a
 

00:50:10.180 --> 00:50:12.610
Israel was to put on the table a
significant prospect which involve

00:50:12.610 --> 00:50:12.620
significant prospect which involve
 

00:50:12.620 --> 00:50:14.770
significant prospect which involve
dealing with a large amount of settlers

00:50:14.770 --> 00:50:14.780
dealing with a large amount of settlers
 

00:50:14.780 --> 00:50:17.110
dealing with a large amount of settlers
and settlements that the United States

00:50:17.110 --> 00:50:17.120
and settlements that the United States
 

00:50:17.120 --> 00:50:18.850
and settlements that the United States
would take this on board given that they

00:50:18.850 --> 00:50:18.860
would take this on board given that they
 

00:50:18.860 --> 00:50:21.430
would take this on board given that they
don't have good idea of what's going on

00:50:21.430 --> 00:50:21.440
don't have good idea of what's going on
 

00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:23.530
don't have good idea of what's going on
now and given that the alternative of a

now and given that the alternative of a

Palestinian attempt to push through

Palestinian attempt to push through
 

00:50:26.560 --> 00:50:28.570
Palestinian attempt to push through
through the General Assembly are

00:50:28.570 --> 00:50:28.580
through the General Assembly are
 

00:50:28.580 --> 00:50:31.390
through the General Assembly are
unilaterally the idea of passing state

in 67 borders with these Jerusalem would

00:50:33.370 --> 00:50:33.380
in 67 borders with these Jerusalem would
 

00:50:33.380 --> 00:50:35.710
in 67 borders with these Jerusalem would
be the equivalent of throwing the cards

00:50:35.710 --> 00:50:35.720
be the equivalent of throwing the cards
 

00:50:35.720 --> 00:50:37.900
be the equivalent of throwing the cards
in the air at a particular time when the

00:50:37.900 --> 00:50:37.910
in the air at a particular time when the
 

00:50:37.910 --> 00:50:39.970
in the air at a particular time when the
region is unstable and my sense is that

00:50:39.970 --> 00:50:39.980
region is unstable and my sense is that
 

00:50:39.980 --> 00:50:42.850
region is unstable and my sense is that
most countries would prefer not to do

00:50:42.850 --> 00:50:42.860
most countries would prefer not to do
 

00:50:42.860 --> 00:50:45.280
most countries would prefer not to do
that and therefore I do think that if

00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:45.290
that and therefore I do think that if
 

00:50:45.290 --> 00:50:47.590
that and therefore I do think that if
the Prime Minister does come out with an

the Prime Minister does come out with an
 

00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:50.260
the Prime Minister does come out with an

laid out that it could actually provide

step-by-step is that first of all you
are required to make concessions and

00:57:07.749 --> 00:57:07.759
are required to make concessions and
 

00:57:07.759 --> 00:57:11.019
are required to make concessions and
then and you start with the least

00:57:11.019 --> 00:57:11.029
then and you start with the least
 

00:57:11.029 --> 00:57:13.329
then and you start with the least
difficult issues so by the time you get

00:57:13.329 --> 00:57:13.339
difficult issues so by the time you get
 

00:57:13.339 --> 00:57:15.670
difficult issues so by the time you get
to the most difficult issues you run out

00:57:15.670 --> 00:57:15.680
to the most difficult issues you run out

I'll just pick up a few of the questions
and a few things about them and maybe

01:01:33.060 --> 01:01:33.070
and a few things about them and maybe
 

01:01:33.070 --> 01:01:34.680

is the way to go I don't think there's a

01:01:46.410 --> 01:01:46.420
is the way to go I don't think there's a
 

01:01:46.420 --> 01:01:49.470

01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:53.460

of that sort what I think does exist now

01:01:53.460 --> 01:01:53.470
of that sort what I think does exist now
 

01:01:53.470 --> 01:01:55.950

is there certain skepticism that it's

01:01:55.950 --> 01:01:55.960
is there certain skepticism that it's
 

01:01:55.960 --> 01:01:58.020
is there certain skepticism that it's
going to happen or that you get very

01:01:58.020 --> 01:01:58.030
going to happen or that you get very
 

01:01:58.030 --> 01:02:01.380
going to happen or that you get very
much in return for initiatives of that

01:02:01.380 --> 01:02:01.390
much in return for initiatives of that
 

01:02:01.390 --> 01:02:02.730
much in return for initiatives of that
sort so I don't think it's going to be

01:02:02.740 --> 01:02:05.040

01:17:50.640 --> 01:17:54.420
and the second answer was that given
given a peace agreement then perhaps

01:17:54.420 --> 01:17:54.430

idea is that who is going to dominate
 

01:18:11.740 --> 01:18:15.390

than the VA yes so so this is the I

01:18:32.400 --> 01:18:32.410
than the VA yes so so this is the I
 

01:18:32.410 --> 01:18:34.020
than the VA yes so so this is the I
think this is this is a major problem

01:18:34.020 --> 01:18:34.030
think this is this is a major problem
 

01:18:34.030 --> 01:18:36.450
think this is this is a major problem
that has that I don't know if there is a

01:18:36.450 --> 01:18:36.460
that has that I don't know if there is a
 

01:18:36.460 --> 01:18:39.420
that has that I don't know if there is a
solution to that but I think that this

01:18:39.420 --> 01:18:39.430
solution to that but I think that this
 

01:18:39.430 --> 01:18:41.370
solution to that but I think that this
is this is a major obstacle on the road

01:18:41.370 --> 01:18:41.380
is this is a major obstacle on the road
 

01:18:41.380 --> 01:18:44.490
is this is a major obstacle on the road

as Gaza there and how you can be sure
 

01:18:57.130 --> 01:19:01.050
as Gaza there and how you can be sure
that this is not going to happen time

01:19:01.050 --> 01:19:01.060
that this is not going to happen time
 

01:19:01.060 --> 01:19:07.410
that this is not going to happen time
whose time every obviously both sides

01:19:07.410 --> 01:19:07.420
whose time every obviously both sides
 

01:19:07.420 --> 01:19:12.110
whose time every obviously both sides
think that time / place into their favor

01:19:12.110 --> 01:19:12.120
think that time / place into their favor
 

01:19:12.120 --> 01:19:15.030
think that time / place into their favor
because if this had not been the case we

01:19:15.030 --> 01:19:15.040
because if this had not been the case we
 

01:19:15.040 --> 01:19:17.780
because if this had not been the case we
might have seen more pressure to

01:19:17.780 --> 01:19:17.790
might have seen more pressure to
 

01:19:17.790 --> 01:19:23.610
might have seen more pressure to
negotiate and to reach an agreement some

01:19:23.610 --> 01:19:23.620
negotiate and to reach an agreement some
 

01:19:23.620 --> 01:19:26.250
negotiate and to reach an agreement some
people some some Palestinian suggest

01:19:26.250 --> 01:19:26.260
people some some Palestinian suggest
 

01:19:26.260 --> 01:19:28.950
people some some Palestinian suggest
that the two-state solution should be

01:19:28.950 --> 01:19:28.960
that the two-state solution should be
 

01:19:28.960 --> 01:19:31.620
that the two-state solution should be
abandoned and that the one-state

01:19:31.620 --> 01:19:31.630
abandoned and that the one-state
 

01:19:31.630 --> 01:19:34.290
abandoned and that the one-state
solution should be adopted counting on

01:19:34.290 --> 01:19:34.300
solution should be adopted counting on
 

01:19:34.300 --> 01:19:37.850
solution should be adopted counting on
the mog raphy and some kind of

01:19:37.850 --> 01:19:37.860
the mog raphy and some kind of
 

01:19:37.860 --> 01:19:40.170
the mog raphy and some kind of
developments maybe in the international

01:19:40.170 --> 01:19:40.180
developments maybe in the international
 

01:19:40.180 --> 01:19:42.870
developments maybe in the international
arena such as un recognition of a

01:19:42.870 --> 01:19:42.880
arena such as un recognition of a
 

01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:44.670
arena such as un recognition of a
Palestinian state within ninety seven

01:19:44.670 --> 01:19:44.680
Palestinian state within ninety seven
 

01:19:44.680 --> 01:19:50.400
Palestinian state within ninety seven
borders somehow will create conditions

01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:50.410
borders somehow will create conditions
 

01:19:50.410 --> 01:19:53.430
borders somehow will create conditions
on the ground that would be much more

01:19:53.430 --> 01:19:53.440
on the ground that would be much more
 

01:19:53.440 --> 01:19:58.230
on the ground that would be much more
favorable to their demands some Israelis

01:19:58.230 --> 01:19:58.240
favorable to their demands some Israelis
 

01:19:58.240 --> 01:20:00.570
favorable to their demands some Israelis
believe time works in their favor and

01:20:00.570 --> 01:20:00.580
believe time works in their favor and
 

01:20:00.580 --> 01:20:03.120
believe time works in their favor and
that eventually the Palestinians would

01:20:03.120 --> 01:20:03.130
that eventually the Palestinians would
 

01:20:03.130 --> 01:20:05.550
that eventually the Palestinians would
would reach a conclusion would conclude

01:20:05.550 --> 01:20:05.560
would reach a conclusion would conclude
 

01:20:05.560 --> 01:20:08.580
would reach a conclusion would conclude
that there is no way to impose their

01:20:08.580 --> 01:20:08.590
that there is no way to impose their
 

01:20:08.590 --> 01:20:11.010
that there is no way to impose their
demands on Israel and that somehow a

01:20:11.010 --> 01:20:11.020
demands on Israel and that somehow a
 

01:20:11.020 --> 01:20:14.100
demands on Israel and that somehow a
compromise is going to be reached so I

01:20:14.100 --> 01:20:14.110
compromise is going to be reached so I
 

01:20:14.110 --> 01:20:17.480
compromise is going to be reached so I
think this is another obstacle to

01:20:17.480 --> 01:20:17.490
think this is another obstacle to
 

01:20:17.490 --> 01:20:19.650
think this is another obstacle to
negotiations to resuming negotiations

01:20:19.650 --> 01:20:19.660
negotiations to resuming negotiations
 

01:20:19.660 --> 01:20:23.700
negotiations to resuming negotiations
right now the impact of the occupation

01:20:23.700 --> 01:20:23.710
right now the impact of the occupation
 

01:20:23.710 --> 01:20:25.350
right now the impact of the occupation
and Israeli society this has been a

01:20:25.350 --> 01:20:25.360
and Israeli society this has been a
 

01:20:25.360 --> 01:20:30.200
and Israeli society this has been a
highly exaggerated in Israel and abroad

01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:30.210
highly exaggerated in Israel and abroad
 

01:20:30.210 --> 01:20:34.860
highly exaggerated in Israel and abroad
it's being made by people who who are in

01:20:34.860 --> 01:20:34.870
it's being made by people who who are in
 

01:20:34.870 --> 01:20:39.530
it's being made by people who who are in
favor of peace now peace now now

01:20:39.530 --> 01:20:39.540
 

01:20:39.540 --> 01:20:41.730
obviously there are all kinds of

01:20:41.730 --> 01:20:41.740
obviously there are all kinds of
 

01:20:41.740 --> 01:20:42.220
obviously there are all kinds of
problems

01:20:42.220 --> 01:20:42.230
problems
 

01:20:42.230 --> 01:20:47.560
problems
I Gaza israel withdrew from gaza it

01:20:47.560 --> 01:20:47.570
I Gaza israel withdrew from gaza it
 

01:20:47.570 --> 01:20:50.760
I Gaza israel withdrew from gaza it
resumed from some parts of the West Bank

01:20:50.760 --> 01:20:50.770
resumed from some parts of the West Bank
 

01:20:50.770 --> 01:20:54.690
resumed from some parts of the West Bank
yeah yeah there are some some problems

01:20:54.690 --> 01:20:54.700
yeah yeah there are some some problems
 

01:20:54.700 --> 01:21:01.240
yeah yeah there are some some problems
that emerge from the need to establish

01:21:01.240 --> 01:21:01.250
that emerge from the need to establish
 

01:21:01.250 --> 01:21:05.470
that emerge from the need to establish
security in a West Bank and I think they

01:21:05.470 --> 01:21:05.480
security in a West Bank and I think they
 

01:21:05.480 --> 01:21:08.500
security in a West Bank and I think they
also emphasized Salomon's and occupation

01:21:08.500 --> 01:21:08.510
also emphasized Salomon's and occupation
 

01:21:08.510 --> 01:21:09.790
also emphasized Salomon's and occupation
have no idea what's going on in the

01:21:09.790 --> 01:21:09.800
have no idea what's going on in the
 

01:21:09.800 --> 01:21:12.280
have no idea what's going on in the
Middle East and do not understand the

01:21:12.280 --> 01:21:12.290
Middle East and do not understand the
 

01:21:12.290 --> 01:21:17.250
Middle East and do not understand the
reef forces that either block or promote

01:21:17.250 --> 01:21:17.260
reef forces that either block or promote
 

01:21:17.260 --> 01:21:24.790
reef forces that either block or promote
negotiations between the two sides on

01:21:24.790 --> 01:21:24.800
negotiations between the two sides on
 

01:21:24.800 --> 01:21:27.490
negotiations between the two sides on
the first question of how much of the

01:21:27.490 --> 01:21:27.500
the first question of how much of the
 

01:21:27.500 --> 01:21:29.470
the first question of how much of the
blockage in the peace process is due to

01:21:29.470 --> 01:21:29.480
blockage in the peace process is due to
 

01:21:29.480 --> 01:21:31.960
blockage in the peace process is due to
the fact that the Palestinians are

01:21:31.960 --> 01:21:31.970
the fact that the Palestinians are
 

01:21:31.970 --> 01:21:34.720
the fact that the Palestinians are
divided of course it makes it harder for

01:21:34.720 --> 01:21:34.730
divided of course it makes it harder for
 

01:21:34.730 --> 01:21:39.250
divided of course it makes it harder for
them to negotiate but quite frankly we

01:21:39.250 --> 01:21:39.260
them to negotiate but quite frankly we
 

01:21:39.260 --> 01:21:42.660
them to negotiate but quite frankly we
didn't see a big dynamic move toward

01:21:42.660 --> 01:21:42.670
didn't see a big dynamic move toward
 

01:21:42.670 --> 01:21:44.050
didn't see a big dynamic move toward
israeli-palestinian peace when the

01:21:44.050 --> 01:21:44.060
israeli-palestinian peace when the
 

01:21:44.060 --> 01:21:46.479
israeli-palestinian peace when the
Palestinians weren't so divided if you

01:21:46.479 --> 01:21:46.489
Palestinians weren't so divided if you
 

01:21:46.489 --> 01:21:50.229
Palestinians weren't so divided if you
go back to when the PLO was a more or

01:21:50.229 --> 01:21:50.239
go back to when the PLO was a more or
 

01:21:50.239 --> 01:21:54.330
go back to when the PLO was a more or
less unified movement the basic

01:21:54.330 --> 01:21:54.340
less unified movement the basic
 

01:21:54.340 --> 01:21:56.710
less unified movement the basic
substantive issues dividing Israelis and

01:21:56.710 --> 01:21:56.720
substantive issues dividing Israelis and
 

01:21:56.720 --> 01:21:59.710
substantive issues dividing Israelis and
Palestinians were still there Abu Mazen

01:21:59.710 --> 01:21:59.720
Palestinians were still there Abu Mazen
 

01:21:59.720 --> 01:22:01.830
Palestinians were still there Abu Mazen

spizz itions on most of these are no
 

01:22:01.840 --> 01:22:06.040
spizz itions on most of these are no
different from more or less what our

01:22:06.040 --> 01:22:06.050
different from more or less what our
 

01:22:06.050 --> 01:22:08.290
different from more or less what our
efforts positions were on terms of the

01:22:08.290 --> 01:22:08.300
efforts positions were on terms of the
 

01:22:08.300 --> 01:22:11.770

right of return rejecting Israeli troops

01:22:16.300 --> 01:22:16.310
right of return rejecting Israeli troops
 

01:22:16.310 --> 01:22:18.280
right of return rejecting Israeli troops
in the West Bank and so forth so that

01:22:18.280 --> 01:22:18.290
in the West Bank and so forth so that
 

01:22:18.290 --> 01:22:20.790

didn't really change from say the early

01:22:20.790 --> 01:22:20.800
didn't really change from say the early
 

01:22:20.800 --> 01:22:22.900
didn't really change from say the early
1990s when Hamas was not a very big

01:22:22.900 --> 01:22:22.910
1990s when Hamas was not a very big
 

01:22:22.910 --> 01:22:25.690
1990s when Hamas was not a very big
figure to today when it it is a bigger

01:22:25.690 --> 01:22:25.700
figure to today when it it is a bigger
 

01:22:25.700 --> 01:22:30.100
figure to today when it it is a bigger
figure so yes it complicates the notion

01:22:30.100 --> 01:22:30.110
figure so yes it complicates the notion
 

01:22:30.110 --> 01:22:32.170

the Gulf region and that's where the

great game is going to play itself out
and in that region Israel's going to be

01:28:59.069 --> 01:28:59.079
and in that region Israel's going to be
 

01:28:59.079 --> 01:29:01.439
and in that region Israel's going to be
behind its barrier and with its
