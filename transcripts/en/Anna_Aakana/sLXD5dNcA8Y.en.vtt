We've all accepted that social media has 
completely changed the way we interact.

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:04.300
Right?

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:05.040
Hey there.

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.080
Come here alone often?

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.081
Excuse me, can't you see I'm in 
the middle of a conversation?

00:00:11.802 --> 00:00:12.833
[Ugh, so rude]

00:00:12.833 --> 00:00:13.647
[Annoyed emoji]

00:00:13.647 --> 00:00:14.804
[ANYWAY]

00:00:14.804 --> 00:00:18.395
The other day, I randomly thought of this 
friend who I hadn't seen in a long time.

00:00:18.395 --> 00:00:20.706
So I went to her Facebook page, 
to see what she's been up to,

00:00:20.706 --> 00:00:21.857
when I saw..

00:00:21.857 --> 00:00:22.920
(typing)

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.393
(gasp) She unfriended me..

00:00:26.393 --> 00:00:28.873
(sad music)

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:29.380
BUT,

00:00:29.826 --> 00:00:30.929
I reacted pretty well.

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:31.547
Hello?

00:00:31.547 --> 00:00:33.017
Kate unfriended me!

00:00:33.017 --> 00:00:35.363
What did I ever do to her? I don't deserve this!

00:00:35.363 --> 00:00:36.744
Are you sure? Maybe it was an accident.

00:00:36.744 --> 00:00:38.210
Oh, it was NOT an accident.

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.169
I refreshed, then I added her as a friend, 
and she didn't accept my request!

00:00:42.169 --> 00:00:44.674
Oh..I'm so sorry babe..

00:00:44.674 --> 00:00:48.710
(sobbing)

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.332
She will pay for this.

00:00:50.332 --> 00:00:52.931
I felt so stupid by how offended I was.

00:00:52.931 --> 00:00:56.834
Cause it's like, what does it matter 
that she unfriended me online, right?

00:00:56.834 --> 00:00:57.611
Wrong.

00:00:57.611 --> 00:00:59.805
This was someone I considered my friend.

00:00:59.805 --> 00:01:02.276
It felt like a deliberate slight.

00:01:02.276 --> 00:01:04.893
Even though I know it probably went like..

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.560
Hmm.

00:01:05.832 --> 00:01:08.180
In my mind, I saw it as..

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.821
You thought we were friends.

00:01:11.052 --> 00:01:12.579
You're dead to me.

00:01:12.579 --> 00:01:14.772
(evil laughter)

00:01:14.772 --> 00:01:17.796
And I kept wishing that we would BUMP 
into each other in real life, you know?

00:01:17.796 --> 00:01:19.771
As if that was gonna be my revenge.

00:01:19.771 --> 00:01:21.210
And not just awkward as hell.

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.019
Oh!

00:01:22.019 --> 00:01:22.807
Hannah, hey.

00:01:22.807 --> 00:01:23.869
Hey, how are you?

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:24.709
You unfriended me.

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.835
We're not friends anymore, are we?

00:01:28.835 --> 00:01:29.773
Well, I just--

00:01:29.773 --> 00:01:31.235
No, it's fine. It's cool.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:32.543
It's real cool.

00:01:33.183 --> 00:01:34.551
(dramatic tone)

00:01:34.551 --> 00:01:35.610
When you're unfriended,

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.552
Yes. Ooh, it hurts.

00:01:37.552 --> 00:01:39.242
You go through the 5 stages of grief.

00:01:39.242 --> 00:01:41.115
No no, she didn't--it was a mistake.

00:01:41.115 --> 00:01:44.145
How dare SHE..unfriend ME?!

00:01:44.145 --> 00:01:46.613
Please God, just friend me again, 
everything will be okay..

00:01:46.613 --> 00:01:48.460
I can't believe she unfriended me..

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:49.179
That's fine.

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:49.928
But it's okay.

00:01:49.928 --> 00:01:54.992
Unfriending and unfollowing is now as much a 
part of life as just breaking up or drifting apart.

00:01:54.992 --> 00:01:57.892
And when I think of all the times I've 
unfriended someone, it was never personal.

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.540
You know, it's cause I updated too much, or their 
updates weren't relevant to my life anymore.

00:02:02.211 --> 00:02:03.071
So it's all good.

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:04.560
I'm Anna Akana.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.446
Stay HERE.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.560
You're not going anywhere, I 
have something to show you.

00:02:09.084 --> 00:02:12.362
