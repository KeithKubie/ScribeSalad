00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:03.600
Where I left off, we were just
essentially chugging through

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.110
this fairly hairy derivative--
this definite integral--

00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:08.910
this antiderivative.

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.500
It takes my brain a
little while to come

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.150
up with the next term.

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:14.300
So we evaluated at 2 and
now we have to subtract

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.320
this evaluated at 1.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:24.120
So minus 16 pi minus 4
pi over 3-- oh, sorry.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:24.650
Plus.

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:26.390
The minus is going to
be on everything.

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.910
Oh no, sorry.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.270
That is a minus.

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:29.290
That's a minus.

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:31.870
Plus 4 pi.

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:32.100
Right?

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.380
Because x is 1.

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.220
Minus pi over 2.

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.440
And now we can simplify it.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.140
Let's see what we can do.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.340
This is really a hairy problem.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:51.680
The 16 pi minus 8 pi,
that equals 8 pi.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.030
And then that's a plus.

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.860
The 32 plus 8 pi.

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.480
32 pi plus 8 pi,
that equals 40 pi.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:06.110
So let's see, I've simplified
it to 40 pi, and what's minus

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.740
8 times 4 is 32 pi over 3.

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.030
And then all of that, let's
see if I can simplify this.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.990
Let's see, 16 pi plus
4 pi, that's 20 pi.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.930
And then, let's see.

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.060
Minus 4 pi over 3
minus pi over 2.

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.740
So let's get a common
denominator for this

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:31.480
part right here.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:36.140
So if I put everything over 6--
20 pi over 6 is the same thing

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:45.015
is 120 pi over 6, and then
minus-- 4 pi over 3, if I put

00:01:45.015 --> 00:01:48.890
it over 6 it becomes
8 pi over 6, right?

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.060
And then pi over 2, if I put it
over 6 it becomes 3 pi over 6.

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.000
So minus 3 pi.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.240
So this whole term that we're
going to have to subtract from

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:04.330
this term is equal to
120 minus 11, right?

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.260
So that's 109 pi over 6.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.080
This equals 1-- is that right?

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.310
Yeah, 109 pi over 6.

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.980
See what happens when you
make up problems on the fly?

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.500
You get ugly numbers.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.890
109 pi over 6.

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.970
And what does that
top part translate?

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.000
So this is what we're
going to subtract.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.955
This is when we evaluated
the antiderivative at 1.

00:02:22.955 --> 00:02:24.510
And let's simplify this one.

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.310
So that one, if we put 3 common
denominator, that's 120 pi

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.190
over 3 minus 32 pi over 3.

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.610
120 minus 32, let's
see, we get 90-- 88?

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:39.290
Right.

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:40.680
88 pi over 3.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.990
So that equals 88 pi over
3, and remember, that's

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:46.320
just the top part.

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.640
And then-- this is more of a
review of fractions than

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.820
anything else-- and then if
I want to put it over

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.830
6, I just double it.

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.590
So I think we're almost done.

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.230
Let me switch colors.

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.790
So if you go over a
denominator of 6-- 88

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.100
pi over 3-- let's see.

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:06.670
If I double that, I
get 160-- 176, right?

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.780
176 pi minus this.

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.910
Minus 109 pi.

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:16.210
I'm sure I made a
careless mistake.

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:19.100
These are my least favorite
type of things to do.

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.050
Hairy fractions.

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:23.430
So 176 minus 109.

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.000
That's the same thing
as 76 minus 9.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.730
And that is 65.

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.890
So our final answer
is 65 pi over 6.

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.070
Which isn't as hairy
as it seemed when we

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.690
started the problem.

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:37.410
But that's pretty neat.

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.790
This is kind of a
strange shape.

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:45.500
It's kind of a wide ring that
has-- the upper part of the

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.160
ring and the inner part of
the ring are hard edges.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.090
But then it's curved
on the outside.

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.830
And we were able to figure
out the volume of that.

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:54.900
Especially-- and what was weird
about this, is when it was

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:00.350
rotated around the line
y is equal to minus 2.

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:01.740
Hopefully I didn't confuse you.

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:06.120
These are about as difficult
as these volume of

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.060
revolution problems get.

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.530
If you want more,
just let me know.

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.200
I will see you in
the next video.
