00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.340
&gt;&gt; Margaret Sullivan: I
have the honor this evening

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.150
of introducing Jeffrey Toobin,
whose new book is American Heiress:

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:19.780
the Wild Saga of the Kidnapping,
Crimes, and Trials of Patty Hearst.

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:23.220
Jeffrey is the author of six books?

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.520
&gt;&gt; Jeffrey Toobin: This is seven.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.010
&gt;&gt; Margaret Sullivan: This
is seven, six previous books,

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:29.720
and is a staff writer at
The New Yorker magazine

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.190 position:56%
and the Senior Legal Analyst at CNN.

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:38.430
He is a graduate of Harvard Law
School where as a longtime fan

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.040
of his, I had the pleasure

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.270
of hearing him address the
law school's 2013 graduates

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.980
which happened to include
my son, Alex.

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.360
&gt;&gt; Jeffrey Toobin: So adorable!

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.660
I love that.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.840
&gt;&gt; Margaret Sullivan: And with
that not-very-humble brag,

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.010
let's turn to your book
which reviewers have called

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.810
"riveting" and "a page turner."

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:04.110
&gt;&gt; Jeffrey Toobin: All true.

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.410
&gt;&gt; Margaret Sullivan: Yes.

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.150
And have, and have praised
it for its nuanced portrayal

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.430
of a truly bizarre
cast of characters.

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.910
I'll just mention that we're
going to leave some time

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:19.860
within this 45-minute period,
about ten or fifteen minutes

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.160
for audience questions,
so please start thinking

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.090
of what you might want to ask.

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.330
And there are standing mics around.

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.290
Including, you could ask,
about our current politics

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.520
because we have an expert
witness in our midst.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:45.250 position:56%
Okay. So Jeffrey, let's start out
by setting things up a bit for those

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.650
who may need a refresher
in the Patty Hearst story.

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.680
May not know the details of this
strange story from the 1970s.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.170
Would you please take
us through kind

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.680
of a bare bones version
of what happened?

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:57.980
&gt;&gt; Jeffrey Toobin: Okay.

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:59.280
Thank you, Margaret.

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.580
Hello everybody!

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.030
How's everybody doing
out there today?

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.040
[ Applause ]

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.340
Thank you for hanging
in to the bitter end.

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.640
Wow, am I?

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:07.940
I'm like too loud.

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.210
But that's my problem, I recognize.

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:11.550
&gt;&gt; Margaret Sullivan: You
definitely woke them up.

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.050
&gt;&gt; Jeffrey Toobin: Well, you
know -- it's just, great --

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.770
you know, it's just like 100,000
people, not here at this event,

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.870
but 100,000 people come to
talk about books and Washington

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.630
and makes you restore
your faith in humanity.

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.640
So thank you all for coming.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.880
Thank you for being here today.

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.180
Margaret, thank you for being here.

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.700
Okay. So I would like to
start by asking a question

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.300
which will help set this up.

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:43.130
Is there anyone here who
was alive in the 1970s?

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:44.540
There we go!

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.030
Beautiful!

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:52.320
So you know, I -- I started
working on this book and, you know,

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.410
I was alive in the
'70s, but I was a kid.

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.070
I didn't have like a sense of
perspective about the '70s.

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:01.560
And I sort of assumed that
the '60s were the time

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.060
that the country was full
of tumult and craziness.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.300
But the '70s, everything sort
of calmed down and chilled out.

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.380
Could not be more wrong.

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.760
The '70s were sort of an extended
nightmare in the United States.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.740
It is astonishing to think
about some of these things.

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:23.750
One fact: a thousand
political bombings a year

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.990
in the United States during
the early and mid-1970s.

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:28.290
Think about that.

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.230
We just had a bombing in New York.

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.300
I don't mean to minimize
that at all.

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:36.270
Try multiplying that times a
thousand, and that's what it was

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.840
like to live in the United States.

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.950
Two hijackings a month
in the United States.

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:50.670
And the epicenter of the craziness
was the Bay Area of California.

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.550
And, and one of the, one
of the signal aspects

00:03:54.550 --> 00:04:00.210
of the craziness was this
alliance between what was left

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:05.360
of the counterculture
and the prison movement.

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.730
There was this idea that
prisoners would be sort

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:11.770
of the vanguard of the revolution.

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:18.870
And there was this keyword here,
symbiosis between the prisoners

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:25.310
and the, the counterculture
figures where they,

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:26.810
they started working together.

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.660
One place in particular,
the Vacaville Prison,

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:34.330
which was outside,
outside of Berkeley.

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.930
Lot of students went there to
visit, as it turns out one prisoner

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.380
in particular, Donald DeFreeze.

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.920
Donald DeFreeze was basically a
low to mid-level hood who sort

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:46.520
of got caught up in this.

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.880
He moves, he gets transferred
to Soledad Prison,

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:54.340
escapes from Soledad
prison in the mid-1973.

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.850
Gravitates to Berkeley because
that's where these students were,

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:01.360
and that is the birth of the
Symbionese Liberation Army.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:06.460
He calls it "Symbionese" because
it comes from the word symbiosis.

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.120
They didn't liberate
anything or anyone,

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.090
and he called it an
army even though it had

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:16.960
about a dozen people
in it at its peak.

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:22.830
In late October of 1973,
DeFreeze becomes obsessed

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:28.370
with a figure named
Marcus Foster who is a --

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:31.620
a, the, the Oakland
School Superintendent.

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:37.740 position:56%
African American, heroic figure, but
DeFreeze becomes obsessed by him.

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:41.700
Decides and does assassinate
him in cold blood

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.530
on the streets of Oakland.

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:48.320
At just that moment, right
afterwards, the SLA, such as it is,

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:51.610
gets an infusion of,
of reinforcements,

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:57.580
three people from the Indiana
University theater program.

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:00.340
There are these three
people, Bill and Emily Harris,

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:06.540
who decide that they are,
are going to -- you know.

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:10.320
They said, like, "Let's, like, dial
it back from the assassination.

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:13.400
Let's kidnap someone."

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:17.680
And they start making lists of
people, corporate figures and -- .

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:21.880
But then, in early January,
just by coincidence,

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:25.730
there's an engagement announcement
in the San Francisco Examiner,

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:31.250
and the, it's the engagement of
Patricia Hearst to Stephen Weed.

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:33.870
Patricia Hearst is 19
years old, she's a --

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:39.350
and it says in the fourth
paragraph of the obituary.

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:40.650
Oh, sorry.

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:41.950
Sorry, not obituary.

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:44.870
An engagement announcement that --

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:51.920
that is like don't even
explore that at all.

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:53.220
[Laughter] The -- my wife is here.

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:54.590
I'm so happy that she's here.

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:56.460
I don't mean that at all.

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:02.520
The -- it says that she's an
undergraduate at Berkeley.

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:06.270
Emily Harris is a secretary
at Berkeley.

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:12.100 position:56%
She knows that in that more innocent
time there is a directory open

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:16.120
to the public of the home
addresses of every student.

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:19.870
So Bill Harris, Emily's -- these
are the two Indiana people,

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:23.600
goes and looks up the home
address of Patricia Hearst:

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:26.700
2603 Benvenue, apartment
number four.

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:28.570
And they start staking her out.

00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:32.260
And on February 4th,
they kidnap her.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:33.840
&gt;&gt; Margaret Sullivan: And this
is just her little apartment.

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:36.380
&gt;&gt; Jeffrey Toobin: Just her little
apartment, and they kidnap her.

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:39.270
And before I stop and let
you ask another question,

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:41.570
I apologize for going
on for so long.

00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:45.070
It's important to remember
that she is a Hearst.

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:46.370
&gt;&gt; Margaret Sullivan: Yes.

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:47.960
&gt;&gt; Jeffrey Toobin: If I may ask
one more question of the audience.

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:52.850
Is there anyone in the audience
who remembers what a newspaper is?

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:54.150
[Laughter] That's alright.

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:56.230
No, I was afraid to make that
joke with you here, Margaret.

00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:57.750
&gt;&gt; Margaret Sullivan:
That's okay, I've heard it.

00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:00.190
&gt;&gt; Jeffrey Toobin:
You've heard it before.

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:06.140 position:56%
But the name Hearst meant something
different in 1974 than it does today

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:10.130
because newspapers were bigger,
richer, and more powerful.

00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:15.020
And there was no name more resonant
and more powerful than Hearst

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:16.650
in the newspaper business.

00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:21.820
So to grab Patricia Hearst as
Donald DeFreeze, Bill Harris,

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:29.130
and Angela Atwood did on February
4th, 1974, was an earthquake

00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:32.440
that is hard to parallel today.

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:35.790
And that's what started the story.

00:08:35.790 --> 00:08:37.090
&gt;&gt; Margaret Sullivan: Okay.

00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:39.150
That was a good primer.

00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:43.160
So, Jeffrey, the New York Times
review of American Heiress,

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:47.090
by Janet Maslin which was
very favorable, by the way,

00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:52.350
called your account,
"Adversarial by definition."

00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:58.460
She noted that Patty Hearst, now
in her 60s, I believe, is alive

00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:02.460
and a frequent participant
in the world of dog shows,

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:06.570
but that she did not
cooperate for your book.

00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:08.850
Was that surprising?

00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:10.150
Was it a problem?

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:14.920
And is the book adversarial
in your view?

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:19.530
&gt;&gt; Jeffrey Toobin: Well,
Patricia Hearst did not cooperate.

00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:22.470
And we did have one
conversation, so I can, I --

00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:25.500
which I can quote in its entirety.

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:31.310
I -- I, you know, I made many
overtures to her directly: email,

00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:34.580
letters, through mutual friends.

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:36.310
I never got a response.

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:37.610
So I figured what the hell?

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:40.340
I was getting to the point where
I had to, you know, you know,

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:41.680
and so I had a phone number.

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:42.980
I called her up.

00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:44.280
I said, "Hi, Patricia.

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:45.600
This is Jeff Toobin."

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:47.020
And she said, "Oh, god.

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:51.500
Click." [Laughter] So you know,
I was getting these mixed signals

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:53.510 position:56%
from her but I didn't really know --

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:57.050
[ Laughter ]

00:09:57.050 --> 00:10:00.970 position:56%
But look, you know, the answer is I
don't consider the book adversarial.

00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:04.140
And this is an -- I mean,
I thought this was -- I --

00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:08.650
all the other books I wrote,
have written, are books,

00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:12.130
stories I covered in real time
and then wrote a book about it.

00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:13.850
You know, two books
about the Supreme Court,

00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:18.220
the recount in Florida,
O.J. Simpson.

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:24.980
And this was a story 40 years
earlier that I knew very,

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:27.500
very little about when I started.

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:31.230
And, and it was really at the
borderline of journalism in history

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:33.480
and the word that I kept thinking

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:36.250
of as I was writing
this book was tragic.

00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:40.300 position:56%
And not in the sense of tragedy-sad,
but the sense of tragedy, in the,

00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:41.600
in the, in the Greek sense.

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:46.730
In that people are prisoners
of forces beyond themselves.

00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:50.830
So I, I did not at all
view this book as like,

00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:53.410
"I'm going to nail
Patricia Hearst" in the way

00:10:53.410 --> 00:10:55.910
that I might have a
motivation about a, you know,

00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:57.890
book about a contemporary event.

00:10:57.890 --> 00:11:00.250 position:56%
You know, to prove that I was right.

00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:02.010
So you know, yes, it is true.

00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:06.080
I draw different conclusions
about Patricia's own behavior

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:09.110
and the story as a
whole than she did.

00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:11.730
But I mean, like I have no ax
to grind with Patricia Hearst.

00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:17.990
I, you know, this is not a person
I have any animosity towards.

00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:20.900
It's just, you know, I followed
the facts where, where they led me.

00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:22.690
&gt;&gt; Margaret Sullivan: And it's
not an unsympathetic portrait,

00:11:22.690 --> 00:11:23.990
I didn't think.

00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:25.290
&gt;&gt; Jeffrey Toobin: No, no.

00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:29.480
I mean, and, and you know,
February 4th, she is --

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:31.620
there are many things
you can say about her.

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:34.720
But the most important thing you
can say about her unfortunately

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:39.680
on February 4th, 1974, is
that she's 19 years old.

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:40.980
You know what?

00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:42.280
I mean, I don't think
I am branding myself

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:45.870
so much an old fart
as to say 19 is young.

00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:52.090
Right? I mean, 19 is very young,
and, and she was very unformed.

00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:58.870
The SLA did not know that as
it happened, she was miserable

00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:00.920 position:56%
in her engagement with Stephen Weed.

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:04.370
She later described
herself as mildly suicidal.

00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:07.910
Having met Stephen Weed,
I can sort of understand.

00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:12.230
But the, you know,
she was, you know de--

00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:16.200
he was treating her like
a sort of proto-housewife.

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:20.130
At the same time, she was very
alienated from her mother.

00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:23.610
Not an uncommon thing for
women in their teenage years.

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:27.160
But her mother was very
conservative, Southern belle

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:32.830
from Georgia who disapproved
of Patricia living in sin,

00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:34.690
as the phrase was in those days.

00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:36.010
So she was kind of whip sawed

00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:37.800
between the principle
people in her life.

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:41.160
So she was uniquely
vulnerable and restless

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:43.930
at the moment she was kidnapped.

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:45.960
&gt;&gt; Margaret Sullivan: So
there is a famous photograph

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:50.570
of Patty Hearst many of you
have seen and can conjure

00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:53.790
in your minds wearing
a beret and she's

00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:57.000
in a kind of a combatant stance.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.620
And she's brandishing
an automatic weapon.

00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:07.680
And it became an iconic image, and
your phrase for it, which I love,

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:13.340
is "a Mona Lisa for the 1970s."

00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:15.110
Is that your phrase?

00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:16.410
&gt;&gt; Jeffrey Toobin: Yes!

00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:17.710
&gt;&gt; Margaret Sullivan: Mr. Toobin --

00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:19.010
&gt;&gt; Jeffrey Toobin:
Take that [inaudible].

00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:20.310
&gt;&gt; Margaret Sullivan:
It's a great phrase.

00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:21.610
&gt;&gt; Jeffrey Toobin: Thank you.

00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:22.910
&gt;&gt; Margaret Sullivan: And
I wish you could explain

00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:24.210
to people exactly what
you mean by that.

00:13:24.210 --> 00:13:25.510
&gt;&gt; Jeffrey Toobin: Okay,
well let me just --

00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:26.910
this requires a little set up here.

00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:30.170 position:56%
But she's kidnapped on February 4th.

00:13:30.170 --> 00:13:33.340
The SLA puts her in
a closet at first.

00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:35.550
But in short order
the closet door opens,

00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:36.850
and they start talking to her.

00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:39.590
One person in particular,
Willie Wolfe, who is --

00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:44.310
of the eight kidnappers, the eight
people in the SLA at that point,

00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:48.440
the most similar to her
in background, class,

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:51.960
son of a physician from
Connecticut, prep school guy.

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:55.120
Went to Berkeley, archeology
student for a while.

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:58.860
And they start to hit it off.

00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:04.530
March 31st, she sends a
communique, a tape that says,

00:14:04.530 --> 00:14:06.560
"I have decided to stay and fight.

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:10.100
And my name is now" -- and
I bet there are people here

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:12.280
who remember this: "Tania."

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:17.680
Tania is the name, the
nom de guerre of the woman

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:23.120
who was Che Guevara's partner
in the jungles of Bolivia.

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:30.450
And, and you know, it's a -- it's
a -- and on April 15th, the, they,

00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:35.120
SLA, the eight of them rob a bank,
the Hibernia Bank in San Francisco.

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:40.810
And they pick that bank because
it had a relatively new innovation

00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:43.940
at that point which
was security camera.

00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:47.750
And they wanted Patricia
photographed in front

00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:51.670
of the camera because, and this is
where the Indiana people really,

00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:56.050 position:56%
they wanted to show, they had a
real concern for PR and showmanship.

00:14:56.050 --> 00:15:00.870 position:56%
And so they put Patricia in the bank
where she would be photographed.

00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:03.300
That bank robbery is
actually a big success.

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:07.220
They get about $15,000,
they go back to the house.

00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:11.180
And to celebrate, they
take two portraits.

00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:14.830
The, there's a group portrait,

00:15:14.830 --> 00:15:19.140
but the more famous portrait
is of Patricia herself.

00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:24.310
And, and she's standing in
front of the flag of the SLA

00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:29.280
which is a seven-headed cobra,
and she's there with an expression

00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:35.530
on her face that I believe is
correctly described as inscrutable.

00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:40.380
And I think the, the,
the, the photograph serves

00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:44.800
as a great metaphor for the whole
story and frankly, for the mystery

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:46.100
at the heart of the book.

00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:47.630
Because you can look
in that photograph

00:15:47.630 --> 00:15:49.870
and say, "She's terrified."

00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:52.550
You can look in it and
say, "She's thrilled.

00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:54.760
She's -- she's happy, she's sad."

00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:59.420
It is a -- it is an mysterious
expression on her face.

00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:02.540
And, and you know, that's the, the
mystery at the heart of my book

00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:06.590
which is is she really part
of the SLA or just coerced?

00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:11.760
And the photograph
displays that mystery in a,

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:16.970
in a Mona Lisa-like way in
that it's just hard to tell.

00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:20.030
&gt;&gt; Margaret Sullivan: Why does
that photo endure so much?

00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:21.960
Is it the mystery at
the heart of it?

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:24.420
&gt;&gt; Jeffrey Toobin: Well,
it's also a bad-ass photo.

00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:25.720
&gt;&gt; Margaret Sullivan: It is.

00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:27.920
&gt;&gt; Jeffrey Toobin: I mean, you
know, there is part of, of --

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:29.670
&gt;&gt; Margaret Sullivan: She's a very
good-looking woman, for one thing.

00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:30.970
&gt;&gt; Jeffrey Toobin: She,
she is good looking.

00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:35.480
But it is also, you know, a part
of the story that, you know,

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:37.570 position:56%
the counterculture was a real thing.

00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:42.380
And, and you know, it is true
thank goodness, that most people

00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:44.530
in the counterculture
were not assassinating

00:16:44.530 --> 00:16:46.210
school superintendents.

00:16:46.210 --> 00:16:48.600
But they were very angry.

00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:52.150
I mean, there, there
was, you know, you know,

00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:57.670 position:56%
this was not just you know, the '70s
were also the time of Watergate.

00:16:57.670 --> 00:16:59.040
And the energy crisis.

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:01.620
I mean, the country
was in bad shape.

00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:05.160
Vietnam was not yet
over at that point.

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:10.980
And, and there were people
for whom rebellion was a very

00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:12.450
appealing thing.

00:17:12.450 --> 00:17:17.070
And here you have this
rich, rich woman.

00:17:17.070 --> 00:17:19.540
You know, with a machine gun.

00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:21.730
I mean, a lot of people
thought that was kind of cool.

00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:25.560
And, and, and, and you know
that photograph, you know,

00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:31.010
she's got a swagger about her that
was captivating to a lot of people.

00:17:31.010 --> 00:17:34.030
So, so it is not, I mean, I -- I --

00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:39.190
you know, it's just a quirk that
Mizmoon Soltysik who was one

00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:41.370
of the kidnappers happened
to snap this.

00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:42.690
It was Polaroid picture.

00:17:42.690 --> 00:17:44.740
It was, you know, crappy camera.

00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:49.000
The group portrait is so bad,
you can barely tell who's who.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:55.720
But it just so happened she caught
Patricia at this mysterious moment

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:58.960
that served as a great
metaphor for the whole story.

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:01.860
&gt;&gt; Margaret Sullivan: So robbing
a bank was not the worst thing

00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:03.160
that the SLA did?

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:04.460
&gt;&gt; Jeffrey Toobin: No.

00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:05.760
&gt;&gt; Margaret Sullivan:
Tell us about that.

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:07.060 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Jeffrey Toobin: Well, see this is

00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:10.050
where I learned the most
in the, in the story.

00:18:10.050 --> 00:18:13.920
Because, you know, I was aware
that she was, she robbed that bank.

00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:16.670
And I -- there's, there's an
almost-as-famous photograph

00:18:16.670 --> 00:18:20.910
from the security camera with her
and the machine gun in the bank.

00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:28.840
But what, what happened was
the bank robbery is April 15th.

00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:33.420
The heat starts to get really
bad in, in, in San Francisco.

00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:37.170
So DeFreeze directs that the nine
of them, the eight kidnappers

00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:39.540
and Patricia, they all go to Los --

00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:42.810
they all decide to
go to Los Angeles.

00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:46.960
They rent a small house
in South-central L.A.

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:51.000
And then they sit there, and
they start to go stir crazy.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.180
Because we usual, the
SLA had no real plan.

00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:55.480
They were just sitting there.

00:18:55.480 --> 00:19:00.110
So one day, May 16th, Bill,
Patricia, and Emily --

00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:04.440
Bill Harris and Emily Harris and
Patricia decide to go shopping.

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:09.800
And they take a van, and
they go to a grocery store.

00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:11.940
Then they go to a newsstand.

00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:13.540 position:56%
And then they go to buy some clothes

00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:16.690
at a place called Mel's
Sporting Goods.

00:19:16.690 --> 00:19:22.460
And Bill Harris parks the van
on, on a main, on a main street

00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:26.360
in Los Angeles across the
street, four lanes of traffic,

00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:27.750
from Mel's Sporting Goods.

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:29.300
Bill and Emily go inside.

00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:31.260
Now just picture the scene.

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:34.480
Patricia's alone in the van.

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:36.330
Key is in the ignition.

00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:38.030
She could drive away.

00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:39.330
She could walk away.

00:19:39.330 --> 00:19:40.630
She could call the police.

00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:41.940
She could call home.

00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:43.390
She does none of those things.

00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:45.190 position:56%
She waits for Bill and Emily Harris.

00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:49.260
Now Bill goes inside the, the store

00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:54.030
and because he's a genius,
he decides to shoplift.

00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:57.330
[Laughter] So he shoplifts.

00:19:57.330 --> 00:19:58.940
Starts stuffing stuff
in his pockets.

00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:01.600
Now as it just so happens,
one of the,

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:07.520
one of the clerks is an aspiring
police officer, Anthony Shepherd.

00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:10.050
And Anthony Shepherd
knows that the crime

00:20:10.050 --> 00:20:13.380
of shoplifting does
not actually take place

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:17.350
until the person leaves
the room, leaves the store.

00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:19.690
So he sort of keeps an eye on Bill.

00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:25.820
Watches Bill leave without paying,
then jumps on him on the sidewalk.

00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:28.110
Emily jumps on Anthony.

00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:29.870
Bystanders jump in.

00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:32.640
It's a melee in front
of Mel's Sporting Goods

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:34.850
with Patricia across the street.

00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:36.150
What does Patricia do?

00:20:36.150 --> 00:20:38.010
Does she do nothing?

00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:39.740
Does she drive away?

00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:44.650
No. Patricia goes into the back
of the van and gets a machine gun,

00:20:44.650 --> 00:20:46.920
fires it out -- takes
it out the window

00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:51.240
and sprays Mel's Sporting
Goods with a entire magazine

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:53.890
of bullets to free Bill and Emily.

00:20:53.890 --> 00:20:55.190
Doesn't work.

00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:57.180
So she gets another machine gun.

00:20:57.180 --> 00:21:00.380
And fires it out, through
the, the glass.

00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:06.080
Again, miraculously
not hitting someone.

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:08.330
And that succeeds and
gets Bill and Emily free.

00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:11.340
The three of them get into the van.

00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:15.470
They realize that this has
drawn a good bit of attention,

00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:21.210
so they decide not to go back to
the house with the other six in it.

00:21:21.210 --> 00:21:26.390
Emily has had a summer job a
few years earlier at Disneyland.

00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:30.170
So the three of them go to
Disneyland where they check

00:21:30.170 --> 00:21:33.820
into a motel and they
turn on the television.

00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:41.260
And they see that the LAPD has
surrounded the six comrades

00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:42.880
in the, in the, in this house.

00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:47.950
And what follows on live
television is the biggest shootout

00:21:47.950 --> 00:21:54.090
in American history to this day:
5000 rounds of ammunition go

00:21:54.090 --> 00:21:57.750
into the house, 3000
rounds come out.

00:21:57.750 --> 00:22:02.990 position:56%
The house is enveloped in flames and
all six people inside are killed.

00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:07.150
Donald DeFreeze, Willie Wolfe,
Mizmoon Soltysik, all of the SLA.

00:22:07.150 --> 00:22:10.380
Four women and two
men, and Bill and Emily

00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:12.760
and Patricia are watching
live on television.

00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:17.920
What follows from May 17th
to September 15th of 1975,

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:22.040
almost a year and a half, is what's
known as "Patty's lost year."

00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:27.060
They rob two more banks, including
one where a woman is killed.

00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:30.650
They set off bombs in the Bay Area.

00:22:30.650 --> 00:22:35.860
That's the crime spree
that she's participated in.

00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:40.110
&gt;&gt; Margaret Sullivan: So Jimmy
Carter commuted her sentence.

00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:44.710
And Bill Clinton pardoned
Patty Hearst.

00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:50.180
As a legal analyst, how do you
see these examples of clemency?

00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:52.060
Were they justifiable?

00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:53.360
&gt;&gt; Jeffrey Toobin: Okay.

00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:57.930
So she's arrested on
September 15th, 1975,

00:22:57.930 --> 00:23:00.060
a year and a half after
she's kidnapped.

00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:05.660 position:56%
She's charged with the original bank
robbery, the Hibernia bank robbery,

00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:07.880
not the two later bank robberies.

00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:11.110
F. Lee Bailey defends
her, big celebrated trial.

00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:15.050
She's convicted and sentenced
to six years in prison.

00:23:15.050 --> 00:23:22.140
The Hearst family mobilizes
a real political campaign

00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:26.000
to get Patricia sentence commuted.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:31.360
A very important intervening event
is another event, another example

00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:34.080
of San Francisco madness.

00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:39.770
The Reverend Jim Jones -- a nod
of recognition, I'm so pleased.

00:23:39.770 --> 00:23:46.470
And the People's Temple, he takes
his group of followers to Guyana.

00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:49.490
They commit mass suicide.

00:23:49.490 --> 00:23:53.820
Nine hundred of them drink poisoned
Kool-Aid and kill themselves.

00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:55.930
It's funny, you know,
people today talk about

00:23:55.930 --> 00:23:57.230
"They drank the Kool-Aid."

00:23:57.230 --> 00:23:59.820
Most people don't even
know what the reference is.

00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:04.670
But it's to the Jim
Jones mass suicide.

00:24:04.670 --> 00:24:09.120
That creates this national
conversation about, like,

00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:14.030
"Why do people do stuff that is so
much against their self-interest?"

00:24:14.030 --> 00:24:18.170
In this environment, Jimmy
Carter commutes her sentence

00:24:18.170 --> 00:24:19.690
with the support of Ronald Reagan,

00:24:19.690 --> 00:24:22.960
his political rival,
after 22 months.

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:25.730
But that's not enough
for Patricia Hearst.

00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:28.990
Twenty years later Bill Clinton is

00:24:28.990 --> 00:24:31.330
in his final days at
the White House.

00:24:31.330 --> 00:24:38.050
And he gets this application
from the Hearst family

00:24:38.050 --> 00:24:40.970
for a full pardon long
after she's committed her,

00:24:40.970 --> 00:24:42.860
completed her prison sentence.

00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:45.730
And she, and he grants the pardon.

00:24:45.730 --> 00:24:47.510
&gt;&gt; Margaret Sullivan: Of course
he was on a pardon-granting spree.

00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:51.010 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Jeffrey Toobin: Right, it was the
same day that he pardoned Mark Rich,

00:24:51.010 --> 00:24:52.350
his brother, Roger,
the -- remember that?

00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:53.650
Good times!

00:24:53.650 --> 00:24:55.030
Clintons are back!

00:24:55.030 --> 00:25:02.820
[Laughter] Going to have
all that stuff come back!

00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:05.500
It's going to be great.

00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:09.050
The, she's the only person
in modern American history

00:25:09.050 --> 00:25:13.230 position:56%
to receive a commutation from one
president and a pardon from another.

00:25:13.230 --> 00:25:15.680
And if you want an
example of how wealth

00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:19.440
and privilege helps you
in America, this is one.

00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:21.130
Thank you for that
ovation from two people.

00:25:21.130 --> 00:25:22.430
[Laughter] The, no!

00:25:22.430 --> 00:25:27.880
But I mean, there are a lot of
people in prison who get mixed

00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:30.950
up with bad people
and they make mistakes

00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:33.190
and they like, do stupid things.

00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:35.360 position:56%
They're not getting any commutation.

00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:36.660
They're not getting any pardon.

00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:39.760
And they sure as hell
aren't getting both!

00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:41.060
But --

00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:42.360
&gt;&gt; Margaret Sullivan: She did.

00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:43.660
&gt;&gt; Jeffrey Toobin: Yeah.

00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:44.960
&gt;&gt; Margaret Sullivan: Now
she's going to dog shows.

00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:46.260
&gt;&gt; Jeffrey Toobin: Now
she's -- uh, excuse me.

00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:47.560
She's participating in dog shows.

00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:49.180
&gt;&gt; Margaret Sullivan: Yes, yes.

00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:54.100
So you have written about
O.J. Simpson in your book,

00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:57.990
The Run of His Life,
which you may have read,

00:25:57.990 --> 00:26:02.460
but if you haven't read it,
you've seen the FX series

00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:04.960
that followed more recently.

00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:06.260
It's very popular.

00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:10.670
Another celebrity who got in
serious trouble with the law.

00:26:10.670 --> 00:26:16.360
And another whose defense
included F. Lee Bailey.

00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:17.660
&gt;&gt; Jeffrey Toobin:
More successfully.

00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:18.960
&gt;&gt; Margaret Sullivan: Yes.

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:25.050
How would you compare the two
trials, and the legal aspects?

00:26:25.050 --> 00:26:29.890
&gt;&gt; Jeffrey Toobin: Well, you know,
it's -- one of the, you know,

00:26:29.890 --> 00:26:34.930
this has been this sort of weird,
you know, the O.J. story has sort

00:26:34.930 --> 00:26:39.620
of come back in a pop culture
phenomenon thanks to the FX series

00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:44.810
and the wonderful documentary
that ESPN did.

00:26:44.810 --> 00:26:47.920
And, and they, they are all -- all
of this is like 20 years apart.

00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:54.300
You have 1974, the
kidnapping; 1994, the O.J. case.

00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:58.020
End of 2016 roughly, the this --

00:26:58.020 --> 00:27:00.950
so you know, I've had occasion to
think a lot about the news media

00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:02.250
in connection with all of this.

00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:06.700
You know, people talk about the
O.J., about the Hearst case.

00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:09.130
They say, "Oh, my god,
there was so much publicity!

00:27:09.130 --> 00:27:10.500
It was like -- " And you know,

00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:13.660
she was on the cover of
Newsweek seven times.

00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:16.400
And people today are
like, "What's Newsweek?"

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:18.630
And what's a cover?"

00:27:18.630 --> 00:27:23.870
And, and, and, and, and the
O.J. case was at a moment

00:27:23.870 --> 00:27:26.970 position:56%
of cable news arriving on the scene.

00:27:26.970 --> 00:27:30.350
Gavel-to-gavel coverage
on CNN, on [inaudible] TV.

00:27:30.350 --> 00:27:35.870
But pre-social media, pre-internet,
and, and, and today, you know,

00:27:35.870 --> 00:27:40.650
you have a completely
different news environment.

00:27:40.650 --> 00:27:43.290
The, the trials I think
reflect, you know, they,

00:27:43.290 --> 00:27:47.430
they all reflected what was
going on in the society.

00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:53.600
First of all, they all reflect
a venerable American truth

00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:56.050
which is it's better
to be rich than poor.

00:27:56.050 --> 00:28:00.980
They also reflect sort
of that trials,

00:28:00.980 --> 00:28:04.820
especially high-profile
trials, reflect, you know,

00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:06.970
the political environment in
which they're, they're taken.

00:28:06.970 --> 00:28:10.180
And one reason why there was
a lot of hostility to Patricia

00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:14.700
at her trial was that this
was a time when, you know,

00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:17.710
what was then called the
Silent Majority was like,

00:28:17.710 --> 00:28:19.010
"Why do these kids?

00:28:19.010 --> 00:28:20.590
Why are we indulging these kids?

00:28:20.590 --> 00:28:23.480
You know, rich kids who want
to go shoot up streets?"

00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:27.900
I mean, you know, the -- she
was not the figure of sympathy

00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:30.320
that in many respects she is today.

00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:33.900
The O.J. case, as you know, I
certainly explored in my book

00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:36.800
and the FX series did
brilliantly, you know,

00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:41.470
reflected the tremendous
history of antagonism

00:28:41.470 --> 00:28:45.510
between the African American
community in Los Angeles and,

00:28:45.510 --> 00:28:47.860
and the police department.

00:28:47.860 --> 00:28:53.540
And I think one reason why O.J. was
such a resonant story in 2016 was

00:28:53.540 --> 00:28:57.690
because we are now in a
world of Black Lives Matter

00:28:57.690 --> 00:29:00.510
and Ferguson and Tulsa
and Charlotte.

00:29:00.510 --> 00:29:03.630
I mean, you know, all of
these stories, you know,

00:29:03.630 --> 00:29:06.780
made that story seem very fresh.

00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:08.820
So in that respect, you know,

00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:12.620
especially these high-profile
trials, they are very much part

00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:16.850
of the broader national dialogue.

00:29:16.850 --> 00:29:19.170
&gt;&gt; Margaret Sullivan: So I
have many more questions,

00:29:19.170 --> 00:29:21.710
but I want to at least, yes!

00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:24.510
Let us, let's open it up.

00:29:24.510 --> 00:29:27.650
And while you're getting to
your mics, I will ask you

00:29:27.650 --> 00:29:31.990
about my favorite one of your
books which is Too Close to Call,

00:29:31.990 --> 00:29:38.150
an examination of the 2000 election
between George W. Bush and Al Gore,

00:29:38.150 --> 00:29:40.110
and its drawn-out aftermath.

00:29:40.110 --> 00:29:43.460
Looking at today's presidential
campaign, is it possible

00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:46.600
that anything similar could occur.

00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:49.630
Has anything happened
to prohibit that?

00:29:49.630 --> 00:29:53.190
&gt;&gt; Jeffrey Toobin: Well, speaking
of my books you know, I am not,

00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:58.040
not going to re-title my
book The Nine, The Eight.

00:29:58.040 --> 00:29:59.350
But that's what we're, you know.

00:29:59.350 --> 00:30:02.040
At the rate we're going,
it's going to be pretty long.

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:03.570
It could be quite a while.

00:30:03.570 --> 00:30:07.710
No, because this is not
going to be a close election.

00:30:07.710 --> 00:30:11.230
Hillary Clinton's going to win
this election fairly easily.

00:30:11.230 --> 00:30:13.310
That's just a prediction.

00:30:13.310 --> 00:30:17.500
That's just a prediction,
that's not an advocacy position.

00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:21.640
But, I, I, I just, I don't
think this is, you know.

00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:23.290
&gt;&gt; Margaret Sullivan: It will
not be too close to call.

00:30:23.290 --> 00:30:25.090
&gt;&gt; Jeffrey Toobin: It will
not be too close to call.

00:30:25.090 --> 00:30:30.080
What remains true, and, and, and
what is interesting in, in --

00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:40.350
about the aftermath of, of the
recount is that it alerted the,

00:30:40.350 --> 00:30:45.640
the political system
to the political nature

00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:48.530
of the electoral process itself.

00:30:48.530 --> 00:30:53.070
That the idea -- you
know, voter registration,

00:30:53.070 --> 00:30:54.810
at least the mechanics of it.

00:30:54.810 --> 00:30:57.050
Certainly, you know, voter
registration was a key part

00:30:57.050 --> 00:30:58.350
of the Voting Rights Act.

00:30:58.350 --> 00:31:03.440
But the mechanics of voter
registration had sort

00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:06.570
of become relatively
uncontroversial.

00:31:06.570 --> 00:31:12.560
Until 2000, and particularly the
Republican Party saw the advantages

00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:17.400
of using the electoral process
to its, to its advantages.

00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:19.780
One thing we, we have
seen, you know,

00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:22.030
particularly since all
the Republican landslides

00:31:22.030 --> 00:31:26.930
of 2010 were these efforts
to limit the franchise

00:31:26.930 --> 00:31:29.820
and limit the people
who vote Democratic.

00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:34.110
You know, limit early voting,
limit absentee voting, you know,

00:31:34.110 --> 00:31:36.380
establish photo ID
requirements, you know.

00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:40.540
In the state of Texas, a gun
permit is a legitimate form

00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:43.280
of identification but
a student ID is not.

00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:45.440
Now how do you think
that helps, right?

00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:51.300
I mean, this, this really began
I think with the, the recount.

00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:56.340
&gt;&gt; Margaret Sullivan:
Thank you very much.

00:31:56.340 --> 00:31:57.640
By the way, full disclosure.

00:31:57.640 --> 00:31:59.630
I lived next door to
Nicole Brown Simpson.

00:31:59.630 --> 00:32:01.980
So you and I could have a
very interesting conversation.

00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:03.280
&gt;&gt; Jeffrey Toobin: Oh really?

00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:04.580
On Bundy?

00:32:04.580 --> 00:32:05.880
&gt;&gt; Margaret Sullivan: Yes.

00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:07.180
Literally.

00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:09.480
I had roses -- I had flowers and
cards for them at my front door.

00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:16.450
Why do you think the lawsuits
against Trump University

00:32:16.450 --> 00:32:21.340
and the shenanigans with his, the
foundation money and all of that,

00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:26.600 position:56%
and all of these other, the plethora
of the abundance of lawsuits?

00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:30.580
And, and challenges to,
to Trump's integrity

00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:36.060
that have been legal have not
really generated the media coverage

00:32:36.060 --> 00:32:43.330
and the depth of media
coverage that other like-crimes

00:32:43.330 --> 00:32:49.640
and like-charges usually do?

00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:52.140
[Inaudible]

00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:53.440
&gt;&gt; Jeffrey Toobin:
Go for it, Sullivan!

00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:55.330
No, come on, you're
the press critic.

00:32:55.330 --> 00:32:56.630
Come on!

00:32:56.630 --> 00:32:57.930
&gt;&gt; Margaret Sullivan:
No, no, you're the star.

00:32:57.930 --> 00:33:00.990
&gt;&gt; Jeffrey Toobin:
It's a hard question.

00:33:00.990 --> 00:33:05.990
You know, I mean, you know, it
is not the case that, you know,

00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:11.060
Trump's various misdeeds have
not gotten a lot of attention.

00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:13.950
Your question illustrates it.

00:33:13.950 --> 00:33:19.800
You know, I, I participated
in CNN discussions where John,

00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:24.660
where he said, you know,
John McCain's not a war hero.

00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:28.310
He's -- you know, I like
people who weren't captured.

00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:32.230
The whole notion of gaffes
as defining moments in --

00:33:32.230 --> 00:33:34.880
you know, the stuff he has
said, we really can't keep track

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:38.020
of all the crazy stuff he has said.

00:33:38.020 --> 00:33:42.190
He has managed to, to,
to float above this.

00:33:42.190 --> 00:33:45.300
And you know, it is
true that I think

00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:49.750
for many months he was
treated more like a curiosity

00:33:49.750 --> 00:33:54.060 position:56%
than a full-fledged candidate, and I
think he benefitted from that a lot.

00:33:54.060 --> 00:33:55.700
Especially in the Republican
primaries.

00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:59.930
But it is also the case that,
you know, there has been a lot

00:33:59.930 --> 00:34:04.230
of detailed searching, scrutiny
to his business dealings.

00:34:04.230 --> 00:34:09.260 position:56%
And you know, and you know obviously
I think Hillary's going to win,

00:34:09.260 --> 00:34:11.310
but it's obviously a very
competitive election.

00:34:11.310 --> 00:34:14.700
And I, I don't know.

00:34:14.700 --> 00:34:19.450
I -- I, I, I wish, I mean, that
is a big part of this election.

00:34:19.450 --> 00:34:24.960
And I don't really understand why
he seems to be immune to the laws

00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:27.380
of political gravity the
way others have been.

00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:29.740
That's a pretty good
answer, isn't it?

00:34:29.740 --> 00:34:32.040
&gt;&gt; Margaret Sullivan: Very good.

00:34:33.330 --> 00:34:35.940
&gt;&gt; I have a craft question that
might interest the audience

00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:37.760
and journalists like myself.

00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:41.830
You write really superbly
researched,

00:34:41.830 --> 00:34:45.150 position:56%
in-depth reported books continually.

00:34:45.150 --> 00:34:48.730
You're very high productive
and prolific.

00:34:48.730 --> 00:34:50.820
How do you manage to
do that in the -- ?

00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:53.660
Is it? Because even
when you are covering,

00:34:53.660 --> 00:34:56.720
let's say the Supreme Court, and
then you do a book like The Nine,

00:34:56.720 --> 00:35:00.280
it has way more depth than what
you were covering in New York.

00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:03.790
And you are a regular guest on CNN

00:35:03.790 --> 00:35:06.170
and The New Yorker
correspondent and a book author.

00:35:06.170 --> 00:35:08.590
Do you like work like
19 hours a day?

00:35:08.590 --> 00:35:09.890
Or have a word count -- ?

00:35:09.890 --> 00:35:11.190
&gt;&gt; Jeffrey Toobin: Definitely now.

00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:13.170
Okay. First of all, thank you.

00:35:13.170 --> 00:35:16.430
Second of all, I'll
give you two answers,

00:35:16.430 --> 00:35:18.750
two reasons why I get things done.

00:35:18.750 --> 00:35:23.350
One is when I write a book, I
am on leave from The New Yorker.

00:35:23.350 --> 00:35:25.150
And I thank David Remnick,
the editor.

00:35:25.150 --> 00:35:28.680
I cannot write New Yorker stories
and a book at the same time.

00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:33.010
So don't think, you know, that's
not in the 19 hours a day.

00:35:33.010 --> 00:35:36.140
The second reason is
extremely simple-minded.

00:35:36.140 --> 00:35:39.470
When I have completed -- more
or less, not totally, but more

00:35:39.470 --> 00:35:45.190
or less completed my research on
a book, I write five pages a day.

00:35:45.190 --> 00:35:47.820
I write 1250 words a day.

00:35:47.820 --> 00:35:55.930
Now, I -- you know, that to
me, I don't know about you,

00:35:55.930 --> 00:36:02.360
but to me the single easiest thing
in the world to do is not to write.

00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:05.750
Is to say, "Well, you know,
I'm going to do research today.

00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:07.120
I'm going to do -- ".

00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:12.770
I am disciplined about writing
1250 words a day which, you know,

00:36:12.770 --> 00:36:16.080
five double-spaced pages which
is not an unreasonable amount

00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:17.440
of a day's work.

00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:19.810
But you know, it's 25 pages a week.

00:36:19.810 --> 00:36:21.120
It's 100 pages a month.

00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:22.850
It really does add up,
and you get a book.

00:36:22.850 --> 00:36:24.470
And I don't write these
doorstop books.

00:36:24.470 --> 00:36:25.770
You know, these books
are a reasonable --

00:36:25.770 --> 00:36:27.450
you know, 300, 400 pages.

00:36:27.450 --> 00:36:30.480
You've got a book in
six or eight months.

00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:34.860
So I, I -- that is the way I --
now I often go back and rewrite.

00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:37.320
It's not like this
stuff is set in stone.

00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:41.130
I do a lot of editing, but
to me, the hardest thing

00:36:41.130 --> 00:36:43.410
in the world is to
write a first draft.

00:36:43.410 --> 00:36:45.980
Anything is preferable
to writing a first draft.

00:36:45.980 --> 00:36:47.720
That's why I force myself to do it.

00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:50.500
&gt;&gt; Well, thank you so much for
your discipline and your hard work.

00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:51.800
We really appreciate it.

00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:53.100
&gt;&gt; Thank you!

00:36:53.100 --> 00:36:54.680
&gt;&gt; Margaret Sullivan:
Let's go back over here.

00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:58.420
&gt;&gt; In the aftermath
of the 2000 election,

00:36:58.420 --> 00:37:02.170
it's somewhat remarkable how
well the country was able to heal

00:37:02.170 --> 00:37:07.690
from such a traumatic electoral
experience with potentially,

00:37:07.690 --> 00:37:11.270
that's because Al Gore
conceded arguably early

00:37:11.270 --> 00:37:13.310
or however you, your
opinion on that.

00:37:13.310 --> 00:37:21.400
If a similar situation happened
now in 2016, while I agree with you

00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:24.020
that it's unlikely the math
would work out in such a way.

00:37:24.020 --> 00:37:28.020
But are we approaching a point
where there's no longer going

00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:32.310
to be this general kum ba yah,
"Okay, well that was kind of rough.

00:37:32.310 --> 00:37:34.990
But let' get back together,
believe in the rules [inaudible]

00:37:34.990 --> 00:37:36.730
and our system of government."

00:37:36.730 --> 00:37:38.030
Is that starting to crumble?

00:37:38.030 --> 00:37:40.180
&gt;&gt; Jeffrey Toobin: Do you
have one candidate in mind

00:37:40.180 --> 00:37:44.420
who might be like a little -- ?

00:37:44.420 --> 00:37:51.860
Look, you know, I think Al Gore
really thought, and correctly,

00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:55.020
that he was committing a
patriotic act by saying,

00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:57.000
"It's over, let's be done.

00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.070
We only have one president
at a time."

00:37:59.070 --> 00:38:05.100
It is true that Donald Trump
does not have a history

00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:08.490
that would suggest a
similar kind of graciousness.

00:38:08.490 --> 00:38:13.310
I kind of like that
sentence, the way I said that.

00:38:13.310 --> 00:38:14.610
&gt;&gt; Margaret Sullivan: It is true.

00:38:14.610 --> 00:38:15.910
&gt;&gt; Jeffrey Toobin:
Wouldn't you say it is true?

00:38:15.910 --> 00:38:17.540
Graciousness is not necessarily
the first word that comes

00:38:17.540 --> 00:38:19.790
to mind when you think of him.

00:38:19.790 --> 00:38:22.980
So -- I don't know.

00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:29.360
I mean, you know, probably this
will, this will not be, you know,

00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:31.000
a, a, a contested election.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.660
But you know, every
time he lost a primary,

00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:35.470 position:56%
he said there was cheating involved.

00:38:35.470 --> 00:38:39.750 position:56%
Remember? So, buckle your seatbelts.

00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:41.800
&gt;&gt; Margaret Sullivan:
Let's go back over here.

00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:44.520
&gt;&gt; Hi, I'm curious about your
fact-finding process behind the

00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:47.090
Patty Hearst project, especially
since she wasn't willing

00:38:47.090 --> 00:38:48.390
to do personal interviews.

00:38:48.390 --> 00:38:50.610
Did you rely on a lot
of public documents?

00:38:50.610 --> 00:38:55.220
And if so, were those hard to get?

00:38:55.220 --> 00:38:58.680
&gt;&gt; Jeffrey Toobin: The -- I, I --
we're running out of time here.

00:38:58.680 --> 00:39:00.980
The, there were, there's a lot
of public documents starting

00:39:00.980 --> 00:39:02.950
with the transcript of her trial.

00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:06.910
Also, you know, she wrote a
book about her experience,

00:39:06.910 --> 00:39:09.210
so that was a very
good place to start.

00:39:09.210 --> 00:39:13.850
She also testified at her trial,
and testified in grand juries.

00:39:13.850 --> 00:39:19.320
Bill Harris, who was one of
the SLA people, later went on,

00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:22.160
when he wasn't in jail,
became a private investigator.

00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:23.570
And a, and a rather good one.

00:39:23.570 --> 00:39:25.670
And he, he's an enormous packrat.

00:39:25.670 --> 00:39:30.940
And he had collected 150 boxes
of material, other court cases,

00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:34.690
FBI documents, SLA material.

00:39:34.690 --> 00:39:37.060
Literally, 150 boxes which he was

00:39:37.060 --> 00:39:40.660
about to sell to a
university library.

00:39:40.660 --> 00:39:41.960
It fell through.

00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:43.390
I bought it from him.

00:39:43.390 --> 00:39:48.210
And in addition to
interviewing about 100 people

00:39:48.210 --> 00:39:50.910
who were still around, I was
pleased to see that 40 years later,

00:39:50.910 --> 00:39:55.120 position:56%
a lot of the protagonists were still
alive, including F. Lee Bailey,

00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:59.410
including the prosecutor who sadly,
died after I interviewed him.

00:39:59.410 --> 00:40:00.710
But --

00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:02.010 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Margaret Sullivan: No connection.

00:40:02.010 --> 00:40:03.310
&gt;&gt; Jeffrey Toobin: Why
are you laughing at that?

00:40:03.310 --> 00:40:06.050
Terrible! No, he just died.

00:40:06.050 --> 00:40:07.350
He was old.

00:40:07.350 --> 00:40:09.430
It was sad.

00:40:09.430 --> 00:40:15.900
But the, so you know,
I, I just approached it.

00:40:15.900 --> 00:40:19.710
I got, inhaled, and
assembled everything I could.

00:40:19.710 --> 00:40:21.020
&gt;&gt; Margaret Sullivan:
Let's do one more question.

00:40:21.020 --> 00:40:22.320
Right here.

00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:25.230
&gt;&gt; Mr. Toobin, do you feel a
responsibility as an analyst

00:40:25.230 --> 00:40:28.840
on television not to be evenhanded

00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:31.900
when one candidate
is lying all the time

00:40:31.900 --> 00:40:34.200
and the other candidate is capable

00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:37.410
of having some problems
in what she says.

00:40:37.410 --> 00:40:42.480
So how do you approach your
colleagues and to make sure

00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:46.610
that you're not evenhanded given
the craziness of this election?

00:40:46.610 --> 00:40:49.680
And by the way, could you please
write a book about this election?

00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:51.450
&gt;&gt; Jeffrey Toobin: Yeah, now
there, there are going to be

00:40:51.450 --> 00:40:53.100
so many books about this election.

00:40:53.100 --> 00:40:56.280
I'm like, I'm seeding the,
I'm seeding the ground.

00:40:56.280 --> 00:41:01.050
You know, this is one of the most
difficult journalistic questions

00:41:01.050 --> 00:41:04.270
that's been asked about
this election.

00:41:04.270 --> 00:41:08.880
And Margaret has dealt with
this in a more learned way,

00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:10.490
in a more experienced
way than I have.

00:41:10.490 --> 00:41:11.950
But the issue of false equivalence.

00:41:11.950 --> 00:41:20.370
And it's not so much the, any
individual's story in terms

00:41:20.370 --> 00:41:25.310
of are you being accurate about
this story versus that story?

00:41:25.310 --> 00:41:27.970
The question is really
what you're covering.

00:41:27.970 --> 00:41:29.820
In many respects, the
most important question

00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:32.960
about journalism is
what stories you cover,

00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:35.680 position:56%
not so much what you say about them.

00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:40.510
And if you do daily, daily coverage
about Hillary's emails, and daily,

00:41:40.510 --> 00:41:43.580
daily coverage about the Clinton
Foundation, even if you're accurate

00:41:43.580 --> 00:41:49.370 position:56%
in each sentence you say, you give
the impression that it is equivalent

00:41:49.370 --> 00:41:52.170
to Trump University and
all, all the rest of it.

00:41:52.170 --> 00:41:56.810
And that is a very hard
question to address.

00:41:56.810 --> 00:42:03.520
And I think in our profession,
that is going to be the biggest

00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:09.550
after the fact question we
all have to wrestle with.

00:42:09.550 --> 00:42:12.540
And, and, and you know,
first of all, I'm hired help.

00:42:12.540 --> 00:42:15.810
I'm not an editor,
I'm not a producer.

00:42:15.810 --> 00:42:19.800
You know, obviously, I have control
over what I say and what I write,

00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:24.350
but I am not someone who, you
know, decides what's being covered.

00:42:24.350 --> 00:42:29.040
And I think that's, that's been
an area that we're going to have

00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:31.420
to do some real soul-searching
about.

00:42:31.420 --> 00:42:32.720
&gt;&gt; Margaret Sullivan: Okay,
we're going to wrap it up.

00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:34.020
Thank you so much, Jeffrey Toobin.

00:42:34.020 --> 00:42:35.820
&gt;&gt; Jeffrey Toobin:
Thank you, Margaret.

00:42:35.820 --> 00:42:40.050
[ Applause ]

00:42:40.050 --> 00:42:43.400

of the Library of Congress.
