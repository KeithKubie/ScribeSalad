00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.950
 The story of a penny originated from the first American Mint established in the United States in 1792. The Mint made these 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.820
 a penny coin, plus other coins, including two hairs, one hair, half hair, and one 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:11.599
 "Mysterious coins", we will mention later. 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:14.910
 The penny coins of these new societies are made of 100% pure copper. 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.230
 However, there are two forces together to ensure that this (100% pure copper) does not last long: the value of copper 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.890
 It has risen, and at the same time, because of inflation, the purchasing power of a penny has decreased. 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.010
 This caused the Mint to reduce the amount of copper in a penny, starting from only 100% to 95%. 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:30.019
 Eventually dropped to only 5% copper and 95% zinc. 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:34.190
 Still, in 2006, the value of metal in the old 1 cent coin exceeded 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.569
 1 cent, suddenly, the value of these coins "dead" is higher than the value of "living", people start to refine the metal in 1 cent 

00:00:37.569 --> 00:00:38.780
 Used to sell money. 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.280
 In a reasonable and efficient world, the story of a penny should end here. 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.679
 The government should see that it is not cost-effective to make a penny, and it is happy to see that the people are blocking 1 cent. 

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:46.629
 It is recycled. 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:50.909
 However, the US government has banned people from melting American coins while continuing 

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:52.389
 Make a million-dollar coin every year. 

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:57.109
 This action idiot spends 1.8 cents in the United States to make a 1 cent coin. 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:00.940
 But even a penny coin is made from something that represents their true value, such as plastic or lint. 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.720
 This will not solve the most fundamental problem of a penny: A penny is not good for the people and the economy. 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:06.859
 The reasons are as follows: 

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:11.259
 The role of money is to make it easier for people to buy things. 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:15.729
 A store keeper has something and you want that stuff. We are not bargaining like a savage. 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:17.679
 We will use money as an intermediary for exchange. 

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:21.200
 In order for us not to pay the value of matter, the coin must be divided into different values. 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.219
 But money will not be divided forever. Because the value of the money representative is too small, 

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:28.259
 No one can buy anything and no one will take care of it. This brings us back to a penny. 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.409
 In the former society, a penny can buy things, but now it can't. Today, if you want to spend it 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:34.560
 For a penny coin, you have to think about it. 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.600
 For example, try to buy 20 dollars, but use two thousand penny coins, weighing a total of 11 pounds. 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.210
 So you have to use the change to use these penny coins. 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.119
 However, there is no tax added in the US market price (not like civilization 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:52.090
 Country), no one can multiply the price by 8.875% in his head, you can't change your change 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.880
 Be prepared before you go to the toll booth. 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.389
 These penny coins that you will deal with after you find the real price of your goods. 

00:01:58.389 --> 00:02:02.340
 On average, each money transaction is extended by 2 seconds, which is not the value of your time. 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.039
 It is not the value of the time of the person who is lined up behind you. This is why normal people do not manage change, 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:10.709
 The "culprits" who often count a penny of coins are those who have not done better. 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.040
 If you want to spend a penny coin but don't waste someone else's time 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.849
 You may be able to find a machine that receives them. 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:20.750
 good luck. The vending machine does not need a penny coin, washing machine or 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.459
 The toll booth or parking meter does not use this coin, or any other machine: because they are not worth it. 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:26.690
 The effort of counting, storing and transporting. 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.849
 In fact, there is a machine that will receive a penny coin: Coinstar--one is ignored by society 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:35.319
 Machine, except that it will only give you money that is already yours, while 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:36.890
 Also charge a 10% fee. 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.180
 The disadvantage of drawing a penny is that they are often discarded in cans and have a dead mass for the economy. 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.120
 After their short, useless lives, they failed in their only job: it lived purely for economic transactions. 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.799
 The impact of its existence is just the opposite: it is the dead weight of every transaction. 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:50.939
 They must be abolished. 

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:54.879
 However, you may think that without a penny, the value of the item will not rise, and the income of the charity will not fall? 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:55.580
 Will not. 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.379
 New Zealand abolished their penny coins, as did Australia. Neither Finland nor the Netherlands 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:02.890
 A cent euro coin. But that might be a penny. The euro is too small and too annoying. 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.250
 The reason is gone. 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.640
 These countries are rounded to the nearest five cents when trading, and they have no experience. 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.090
 Price increases or charitable donations declined. 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.340
 At the same time, the United States has also abolished coins and has not had any trouble. 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.159
 Remember the "mystery coin" in front of the film? This is half a penny. Have you seen one recently? you 

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:23.590
 of course not. It was abolished in 1857 because it was too worthless. 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:28.299
 But when half a penny is deactivated, it’s worth more than today’s, so it’s possible 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:31.409
 A list of coins that can be revoked today can be added to a few. 

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:34.579
 This has the last, unreasonable reason why you can't abolish a penny coin. 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:38.810
 Everyone loves Lincoln -- at least, most people love him. After the history of the Statue of Liberty and the United States, 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.299
 The United States really has Lincoln - a coin of one inch size. 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:44.260
 But eliminating a penny coin will not erase Lincoln from history. 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.900
 Lincoln and his monument will still be on the five-dollar bill that will not be eliminated. 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.269
 At the same time, if you think that retiring a coin with a presidential head is unpatriotic or inhuman, 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:55.900
 Please allow me to pick you up a small organization called the US military. 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.780
 Here, they have already abandoned a penny coin at their overseas bases and automatically rounded them up to 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.359
 The last five cents. 

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:05.280
 In the morning and evening, those who are most enthusiastic about Lincoln have to give up a penny coin: they 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.030
 The price is lower than the price at which they are made, they waste people's time, they can't be used as money, 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.920
 At the same time, because of the fact that they are getting less and less money each year because of inflation, several other problems have been severed. 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.250
 Sorry for Lincoln, but it's really time to stop a penny coin.
