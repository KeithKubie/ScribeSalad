00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.140
is

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.140
possible.

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.140
All

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.140
printmaking

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.140
processes

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.140
have

the

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.140
possibility

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.140
and

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.140
capability

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:36.140
of

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:42.140
And

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.140
so,

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.140
everyone

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.140
deals

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.140
day.

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.140
And

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.140
that

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.140
is

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:55.140
a

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:57.140
It's

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:58.140
a

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.140
multiple.

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.140
And

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.140
as

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.140
we

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.140
get

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.140
closer

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.140
we're

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.140
doing

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.140
the

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.140
same

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.140
conceptual

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:13.140
focus

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.140
of

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.140
what

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:16.140
a

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:19.140
is,

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:27.140
But

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:28.140
it's

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.140

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:33.140
And

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:34.140
once
