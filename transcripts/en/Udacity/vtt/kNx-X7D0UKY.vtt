00:00:00.037 --> 00:00:03.010
Up till now your webpage has only
been available on your own computer,

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:05.150
and you haven't been able
to share it with anyone.

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:07.370
That's not a ton of fun,
so in this stage,

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.260
you're actually going to
put your website online.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.160
And make it interactive, so that the
users who visit your page can change it.

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:16.280
Doing this is going to require
that you set up a server,

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.490
which isn't nearly as hard as it sounds.

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.568
And write some server-side code that
handles the request from the users that

00:00:22.568 --> 00:00:23.766
have to see your page.
