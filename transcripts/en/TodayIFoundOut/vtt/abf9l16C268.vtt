00:00:03.939 --> 00:00:29.400
The president of 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.360
the United States never technically takes
a day off.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.789
Even when they’re ostensibly “on vacation”
they are still very much the leader of the

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:40.149
country and have many duties to fulfill on
a daily basis.

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:45.039
For example, even while on vacation, they
need to continue to have things like intelligence

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:49.839
and national security briefings and other
such meetings so that if an emergency does

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:53.910
suddenly come up, they can react quickly in
an informed way.

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.879
Because of this, the president, in addition
to never technically being able to have a

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.730
full day off while on vacation, doesn’t
get sick days either.

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:05.950
Of course, the president is not only human
but also generally speaking a quite old human,

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.350
and thus they get ill, occasionally seriously.

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.500
So what happens then?

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.660
This is where the 25th Amendment potentially
comes into effect.

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.760
In a nutshell, among other things, it provides
that if the president ever gets so ill that

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:25.980
they cannot physically perform necessary presidential
duties anymore, their vice president can become

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:30.540
the “Acting President” on their behalf
until they’re able to resume their duties.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.760
So, in a way, this is a mechanism for the
president to take a sick day if they want

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.620
it and whenever they want it.

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.730
It’s also noteworthy that even if the president
does not wish to relinquish the office during

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:46.200
a time when they are “unable to discharge
the powers and duties of his office”, the

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.240
25th Amendment provides a mechanism for the
vice president to simply take the office from

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.380
the president until such time as the president
is once again able to resume duties.

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.770
(Amusingly, it’s not fully clear here what
the scope of this section of the 25th Amendment

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:02.770
is.

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.840
For example, while the president is sleeping,
and thus in an unconscious state, they are

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.800
most definitely “unable to discharge the
powers and duties of [the] office” until

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:13.800
someone wakes them up.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.980
So technically the vice president and certain
others could get together on any given night

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.920
and temporarily make the vice president acting
president until such time as the president

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.370
wakes up and no doubt sends off the appropriate
document to declare that they are, in fact,

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:29.370
fit for duty, with Congress no doubt concurring
at that point…

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.370
Or, if I were president and my VP did that,
I’d probably just take that rare opportunity

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:31.370
to roll back over and sleep in for once, then
maybe around noon have a leisurely breakfast

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:32.370
before finally sending off the appropriate
letter that I’m back in business.)

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.170
In the end, this latter rule allowing the
vice president to forcibly take over is probably

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.670
for the best as United States presidents are
generally loath to give up the office, even

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:40.670
temporarily.

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.680
Despite many, many presidents having serious
health issues and occasionally being incapacitated

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.400
during their time in office (generally largely
kept from the public eye at the time), only

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:56.370
two have actually used this power in the over
half a century since the 25th Amendment was

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:57.370
ratified.

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.819
Breaking the trend, the first president to
make use of the 25th Amendment was Ronald

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:07.740
Reagan on July 13, 1985 when he temporarily
officially bestowed the powers of the office

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:12.750
onto Vice President George Bush while Reagan
underwent surgery for colon cancer.

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.750
Bush reportedly spent a whole 8 hours being
president before Reagan decided he’d recovered

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.650
enough from his surgery to start being president
again.

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:26.370
A thing to note is that prior to handing off
the powers of the presidency to Bush at 11:28AM,

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.349
Reagan spent his morning as he normally did,
going about presidential duties, and subsequently

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:35.400
spent most of the evening after he became
president again at 7:22PM catching up on everything

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.989
he’d missed during the day.

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.700
So not really much of a sick day.

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.980
The only other president to bestow the powers
of the presidency on their vice president

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:51.090
was George W. Bush in 2002 and later in 2007,
each time so that he could have a colonoscopy.

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:56.180
On each occasion, Vice President Dick Cheney
was acting president for a little over 2 hours

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.480
at which point Bush resumed his duties.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.540
Or to put it another way, during his 8 years
in office, Bush technically had four hours

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.580
of official time off, most of which he spent
with a camera up his butt…

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:07.580
(It’s good to be the president?)

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:12.280
This lack of leave taken for ill health is
a surprising fact given, as previously alluded

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.840
to, the large percentage of presidents who
have suffered through various serious illnesses

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.049
during their time in office.

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:24.060
Most infamously, Woodrow Wilson had a massive
stroke in 1919 resulting in the temporary

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.810
loss of use of the left side of his body,
as well as him becoming blind in the left

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:30.410
eye and with diminished vision in his right.

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:34.250
What his cognitive state was at this time
isn’t fully known, as this was all kept

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:38.720
from the public by his wife, Edith, and his
physician, Dr. Cary Grayson.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.350
So how was he able to run the country in this
state?

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.310
Well, he wasn’t really.

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:49.600
His wife took over handling what information
was passed to him and what issues she simply

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.020
delegated out for other people to handle.

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:56.500
She also barred any direct access to the president
for several weeks after the stroke, with the

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:01.770
lone exception being that Dr. Grayson was
allowed to attend him (and we’re speculating

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:05.400
nurses, though this is never mentioned anywhere
we could find).

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.250
As Edith herself would later write,

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:12.160
So began my stewardship, I studied every paper,
sent from the different Secretaries or Senators,

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:16.700
and tried to digest and present in tabloid
form the things that, despite my vigilance,

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.360
had to go to the President.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:23.110
I, myself, never made a single decision regarding
the disposition of public affairs.

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:28.770
The only decision that was mine was what was
important and what was not, and the very important

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:31.580
decision of when to present matters to my
husband.

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:36.110
That said, it is thought by many historians
that her claim that she never made direct

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:41.590
presidential decisions herself is at best
stretching the truth and at worst a blatant

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:42.590
lie.

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:44.960
That’s not to mention completely controlling
the information that went to the president

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:49.900
and what tasks (and to whom) were delegated
out is questionable for a person not elected

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:51.009
to office to do, even for a day, let alone
an extended period.

00:05:51.009 --> 00:05:55.290
While Wilson did recover somewhat over the
next year and a half or so of his presidency,

00:05:55.290 --> 00:06:00.090
in the interim there was much question over
whether he was actually still mentally and

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:03.970
physically fit enough to continue on as president.

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:08.550
Despite this and certain very pressing and
far reaching matters being decided, like whether

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:14.419
the United States should join the League of
Nations, he refused to give up his position-

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:19.300
a key point discussed when the 25th Amendment
was being drafted a few decades later.

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:23.551
While other presidents had before and after
Wilson suffered from various ailments, most

00:06:23.551 --> 00:06:28.449
notable to the development of the 25th Amendment
was Dwight D. Eisenhower.

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:32.669
While in office, he suffered a severe heart
attack and then a subsequent stroke.

00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:37.729
He also had to have surgery to remove about
ten inches of his small intestine as a result

00:06:37.729 --> 00:06:40.479
of complications owing to Crohn’s disease.

00:06:40.479 --> 00:06:45.110
During these times, he did attempt to take
sick days by having Attorney General Herbert

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:50.340
Brownell Jr write up a document passing off
some of the powers and duties of the president

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:52.570
to Vice President Richard Nixon.

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:56.710
Other presidents had more or less done similar
things before when necessary, but always in

00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:00.740
secret, so as not to publicly reveal their
medical issues.

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:04.560
Eisenhower was essentially bucking the trend
of keeping it secret and trying to set a precedent

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:05.560
to make the whole thing official.

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:08.220
And, indeed, from a practical standpoint,
Nixon and Eisenhower’s cabinet did take

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:10.160
over his duties when he was incapacitated.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:14.650
It also could be interpreted that Article
II, Section 1, Clause 6 of the U.S. Constitution

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:19.470
did allow for such when the president was
unable “to discharge the powers and duties

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:20.479
of the… office”.

00:07:20.479 --> 00:07:24.380
But the wording here is sufficiently vague
to call into question whether in these cases

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:29.289
the vice president is actually endowed with
the powers given to the president.

00:07:29.289 --> 00:07:33.889
Because of this, despite Eisenhower giving
the green light, there was uncertainty whether

00:07:33.889 --> 00:07:39.300
Nixon was actually the acting president or
not at these times, which could have created

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:42.360
major problems had certain emergencies come
up.

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:47.840
The matter finally came to a head with a president
most considered the picture of robust, youthful,

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:49.710
health- John F. Kennedy.

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:54.410
It turns out, Kennedy essentially needed his
own pharmacy and team of doctors to keep him

00:07:54.410 --> 00:08:00.410
functioning semi-normally throughout his presidency-
a fact only quite recently made publicly known.

00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:05.169
The medical issues Kennedy suffered from were
many and serious (some of which may in turn

00:08:05.169 --> 00:08:09.060
have been caused by the extensive medication
he regularly took).

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:13.490
First up was a potentially life threatening
problem in Addison’s disease, where the

00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:18.380
adrenal glands don’t produce enough of certain
essential hormones.

00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:22.710
Next he suffered from osteoporosis resulting
in three fractured vertebrae in his back.

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:26.470
He also suffered from irritable bowel syndrome
that saw him dealing with severe abdominal

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:29.800
pain and occasional dangerous bouts of diarrhea.

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:30.830
Then there was his hypothyroidism.

00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:35.810
And, just for fun, likely because of some
of the medications he was on, he seemed particularly

00:08:35.810 --> 00:08:37.390
prone to infections.

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:43.500
To treat all this, he was variously put on
thyroid hormone, Ritalin, methadone, Demerol,

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:49.040
barbiturates (such as phenobarbital), various
antidiarrheal drugs, testosterone, procaine,

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:53.490
codeine, corticosteroids, Lomotil, Metamucil,
paregoric, amphetamines, meprobamate, Librium,

00:08:53.490 --> 00:09:01.550
and given penicillin and various other antibiotics
whenever infections would spring up…

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:07.459
Notably, many of these medications could potentially
effect mood and his decision making ability.

00:09:07.459 --> 00:09:10.830
But without some of them, Kennedy would have
been crippled by pain.

00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:15.600
Even with them, as Kennedy’s political advisor,
Dave Powers, once noted, Kennedy always traveled

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:16.600
“with crutches”.

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:18.620
Further, when he was out of the public eye,
he walked

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:22.810
gritting his teeth…but then when he came
into the room where the crowd was gathered,

00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:27.410
he was erect and smiling, looking as fit and
healthy as the light-heavyweight champion

00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:28.500
of the world.

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:32.500
Then after he finished his speech and answered
questions from the floor and shook hands with

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:37.000
everyone, we would help him into the car and
he would lean back on the seat and close his

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.190
eyes in pain.

00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:42.710
Kennedy’s many maladies were not, however,
what helped spur the creation of the 25th

00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:45.690
Amendment, though may have been had they been
widely known.

00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:49.620
Rather, it was when Kennedy was shot that
everything finally came to a head, with the

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:55.600
question being asked, “What would have happened
had Kennedy lived, but been in a brain-dead

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:56.600
state?”

00:09:56.600 --> 00:10:00.800
As previously noted, while one could interpret
Article II, Section 1, Clause 6 of the Constitution

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:05.709
in such a way as to provide for the vice president
to take over almost immediately in such cases,

00:10:05.709 --> 00:10:09.370
the wording wasn’t concrete enough on this
or for many other such scenarios in which

00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:12.450
the vice president might need to become Acting
President.

00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:16.730
It wasn’t even clear in these cases if the
vice president did take over if the original

00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:21.110
president should get the job back if they
were once again fit for office later during

00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:22.550
the allotted term.

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:26.700
This ambiguity is a major issue if, say, a
nuclear strike was launched against the United

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:30.970
States in the interim from when the president
was no longer fit for office and when the

00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:35.660
government finally got around to deciding
the vice president should indeed take over.

00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:40.920
Thus, about a year and a half after Kennedy’s
assassination, in July of 1965, congress sent

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:46.890
the 25th Amendment out to the states to ratify,
which it finally was on February 10, 1967,

00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:50.170
clarifying what should be done in many of
these scenarios.

00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:54.860
So to sum up, the president is not given any
allotment of sick days, but the 25th Amendment

00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:59.430
does provide them a mechanism to take such
if they feel like they’re unable to perform

00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:00.570
the duties of the office.

00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:05.370
But, for reasons like that it’s not politically
couth for the president to show any weakness,

00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:10.310
only two presidents in history have ever done
this since it became an option- both of whom

00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:13.550
were having something done to their colon
at the time…

00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:17.770
For the rest, when they were medically incapacitated,
they seem to generally try to hide this from

00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:22.830
the public whenever possible and to delegate
tasks and rearrange their work schedule as

00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:25.520
best they could to take a little time off.

00:11:25.520 --> 00:13:02.370
And, where they couldn’t do such, they simply
muscled through the rest of their duties.
