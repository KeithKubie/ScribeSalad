First a trivia quiz for you. Who started content distribution networks, and

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.900
why? And I'm giving you a bunch of choices for who may have

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.530
started the idea of content distribution networks including

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.480
big players such as IBM, Napster, Facebook, Netflix, Akamai,

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:26.070
Apple, Microsoft, Google. And, the why part of it,

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.260
is it for content distribution of

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.280
world news, e-commerce information, online education,

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:36.890
like what we're doing right now, music sharing, photo and video sharing?
