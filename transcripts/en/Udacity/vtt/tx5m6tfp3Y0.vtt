Let's practice writing documentation. In this version of the Person class,

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:08.200
there's a java.comment for getFriends. What's wrong with this documentation

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.190
comment? The first sentence shouldn't have a period. The first sentence should

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.690
describe the method. There's no at param statement or the at return statement

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:19.950
should describe the method. How would you write this documentation comment?
