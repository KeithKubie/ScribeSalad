[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.810
Hello, my name is Ankur Kotwal
and welcome to This Week

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:14.830
in Android Development
for February 17, 2014.

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:17.600
Last week Leon showed us
how to use the Google Cast

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.130
SDK for Android,
whilst Katherine

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.450
showed us how to connect
to Google Play services

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:24.900
using the GoogleApiClient.

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.520
Katherine also put
together a special app

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.660
to help you connect
with your valentine,

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.780
and this was actually
part of a two-part DevByte

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.980
series called "Just For Us."

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.290
Todd gave us lesson 3.1 in the
ongoing "Play Games for iOS"

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.960
series, where he showed
us how to use leaderboards

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.150
to connect with your loved ones.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.900
Fred's "Mystery DevByte"
series has been revealed

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.680
and it's on the Media
Router Framework,

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.230
so please be sure
to check it out.

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.090
And Todd and Wolf are going to
explain turn-based multiplayer

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.000
gaming in the latest
episode of "Game On."

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.790
For this week in Android
Development, I'm Ankur Kotwal.

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.599
Because maybe you're going
to be the one that saves me,

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:07.301
and after all,
you're my wonderwall.
