00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.760
 We are all looking forward to the future, but have you ever considered that you can only see the past? 

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:08.400
 It takes just 80 milliseconds for your brain to process information, 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.880
 that means you never really live in the present. 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.600
 Not to mention, your eyes need time to perceive light from an object, 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.660
 so you actually see what they looked like a fraction of a second ago. 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.720
 For example, when you look at the stars, 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:27.000
 you see light that has taken years to travel, and so you see what the stars looked like. 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.580
 The next time you look, you must realize that that light has traveled through everything 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.540
 the universe, until it comes to you. 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.280
 So watch out, or not, because seconds ago you were miles away. 

00:00:37.284 --> 00:00:41.822
 How? The earth revolves around its axis while it revolves around the sun. 

00:00:41.822 --> 00:00:46.878
 But the sun also revolves in the galaxy, which in turn flies into the universe. 

00:00:46.878 --> 00:00:50.020
 That you then have the chance to see that light, quite incredible. 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.460
 It puts the things of dimensions in a perspective. 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.860
 Such as the fact that a dust particle is almost between the Earth and a subatomic particle. 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.960
 In the meantime, there are more atoms in a glass of water than glass in all oceans. 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.020
 And talking about oceans, if all the oxygen on earth disappeared for 5 seconds, 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.220
 then the hydrogen atoms are released and evaporate into space. 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.420
 Either way, you cannot see the Great Wall from space. 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.508
 You can see the air pollution. 

00:01:17.508 --> 00:01:19.028
 Do you feel disoriented? 

00:01:19.028 --> 00:01:21.116
 If you travel north, you'll end up south. 

00:01:21.116 --> 00:01:24.349
 But if you travel west, you keep traveling west. 

00:01:24.349 --> 00:01:29.250
 The chance that you will have an accident along the way to purchase a lottery ticket is greater than winning the main prize. 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.973
 Meanwhile, when a pregnant woman has a damaged organ, 

00:01:31.973 --> 00:01:33.148
 like a heart attack 

00:01:33.148 --> 00:01:35.440
 sends the fetus stem cells to the damaged organs, 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:36.540
 to help it recover. 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:37.560
 Warm outside? 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.840
 The temperature of the testicles at rest is approximately 35 degrees Celsius, 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.160
 or 95 degrees Farhenheit, 

00:01:42.315 --> 00:01:45.435
 on a warm day that means literally "Hot as Balls". 

00:01:45.435 --> 00:01:47.000
 Hopefully that made you smile, 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.900
 Because even made laughter can give the brain the idea that you are really smiling, 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.100
 which in turn can produce endorphins and joy. 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.560
 People are just machines that convert energy into ideas. 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:03.960
 And it appears that all history and time has given you the opportunity to hear this, so thanks for your time.
