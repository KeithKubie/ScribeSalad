00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.907
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 700 is Grant's profit. If he doesn't sell any glasses cleaning sets. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Since

00:00:04.907 --> 00:00:09.954
this equation is written in slope intercept form, this is the y-coordinate of

00:00:09.954 --> 00:00:14.711
the y-intercept, b, in our equation, y equals mx plus b form. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; That means

00:00:14.711 --> 00:00:19.643
there's a point on this line that has the coordinates 0,700. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Since x in our

00:00:19.643 --> 00:00:24.767
equation stands for the number of glasses cleaning sets Grant sells, and y

00:00:24.767 --> 00:00:29.916
stands for his profit, &amp;gt;&amp;gt; This tells us that if Grant doesn't sell any glasses

00:00:29.916 --> 00:00:32.164
cleaning sets, he will make $700.
