00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.790
&gt;&gt; Thanks so much for coming.
I'm here to introduce David Chang, as you

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:13.009
know, the chef of Momofuku, Ssam Bar, Ko,
Bakery and Milk Bar.

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:15.950
And after the talk, we'll do a little Q and
A.

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:21.270
And then, up in Hemispheres -- if you were
lucky enough to get a book -- David will be

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:28.220
signing books. All right?
Thanks so much for coming.

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.540
Here's David Chang.

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:31.540
&gt;&gt; [Clapping]

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:39.510
David Chang: Thanks. Good morning everyone.
Very strange. Google last week, San Francisco.

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.590
Google, New York.
And I never thought, again, cooking would

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:53.550
lead me to both Google campuses.
[laughter] Very strange. And yeah, I got into

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.940
cooking.
And how I got here is very, very strange and

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.280
surreal.
I started to cook, because I did very poorly

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:09.740
in college, because I spent most of my time
with doing extracurricular activities, and

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:17.570
not enough time in the classroom, which is
why Google would never, ever hire me. [laughter]

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.310
And it was a real struggle to figure out what
I wanted to do after college, and cooking

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:28.909
was one of the few things that I knew I enjoyed.
And it was one profession that my father -- I

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:34.800
could have chosen to be a garbage man, he
would have been more pleased with the decision

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.729
I made. [laughter]
Because he spent his entire life -- he immigrated

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.130
to this country, and he spent his entire life
working 30 years in the restaurant industry

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:51.920
so I would never work in the restaurant industry.
And it's ironic.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:58.229
And you know, he sent me to the best schools
he could and all that stuff -- and I still

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:04.619
wound up being a cook.
And I wanted to see how far I could take it.

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.201
That was it.
It was one time -- I mean, I've had a lot

00:02:08.201 --> 00:02:10.950
of discussions recently about like, Is there
anything pure?

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.590
Is there anything honest in terms of a craft
anymore?

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:20.450
And, at that time, it was like '99.
You know, it was either dot com or banking

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:26.200
or whatnot.
And I just felt that cooking was one of the

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.150
few things that I thought was honest -- that
you could apply yourself, and you could get

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.890
better every day.
And it was remarkable, because you could use

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.730
your hands.
You could sort of act like a total buffoon,

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:45.510
but still -- there's this total chaos -- but
it's under this umbrella of this sort of French

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.629
system of a brigade.
And I don't know.

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:55.040
I felt like I found my call and that I could
do this.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:01.610
And then, you know, I was never the best cook
in the kitchen.

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:09.450
I worked for some great chefs -- for Jean
George, Tom Colicchio, Daniel Bleu, Das Caramelini.

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.640
And spent some time in Tokyo.
But I got out of the game.

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.420
And I say the "game" -- I say "fine dining
game" -- because we normally associate great

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:24.660
food with fine dining.
And when I started cooking -- and it wasn't.

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:30.900
I can't say it's 20 years.
It was like ten years ago, you know, food.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.450
You had the Food Network, but 'food' and 'cooking'
wasn't cool.

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.580
Like, if any of you guys are thinking about
career-changing and going into cooking school,

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:44.349
like think twice. [laughter]
Because it's a hard, hard business. It's not

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:51.200
glamorous.
And, you know, TV has made it seem much more

00:03:51.200 --> 00:04:00.380
cooler than it actually is.
So, you know, going back, I don't know if

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.770
I'd actually be cooking in this world -- that
is like, today's like food world, because

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:10.640
it's just getting crazier and crazier.
And I've had to, you know, learn to deal with

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.310
it.
I got into cooking so I wouldn't have to speak

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:18.509
in front of people. [laughter]
And here I am, speaking in front of all these

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:25.690
people, and I have no idea what the hell I'm
talking about. [laughter]

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:28.539
So I've always sort of been a weirdly competitive
person.

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:33.789
I think it has to do, again, with golf -- and
this was before it was super-cool to play

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:37.919
golf.
And I had the typical Asian father who was

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:45.040
like, trying to make me, you know, pro.
And then, I realized that -- I'll never forget,

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:49.300
I was trying to qualify for this tournament,
and I played -- all I did was play golf 365

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.950
days a year.
I was trying to qualify for this tournament

00:04:52.950 --> 00:05:01.169
in Houston, and I was eleven.
Tiger Woods was already on the brochure of

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:04.080
the event.
It was called the 'Big I' in Houston.

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:09.639
And he had already won it two years in a row.
And that's when I knew -- I was like, "Yeah,

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:13.930
this guy's a lot better than I will ever be,
so."

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.550
I think it slowly coincided with me just burning
out on golf.

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:21.330
But, you know, there's something interesting
between golf and cooking -- at least for me

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:27.490
 -- because, when you're playing golf -- and
I hate golf now -- is that, it's against you.

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:34.729
It's just you and the golf course.
And the only competition is the scoreboard

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:40.659
and your competitors.
So, I am always measuring myself against people.

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:46.919
I wish I had that sort of competitive drive,
you know, during school.

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:53.509
That would have been great.
But, in cooking, you sort of see who is the

00:05:53.509 --> 00:05:58.360
best cook in the kitchen.
This guy's a sous chef, and he got there from

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:03.419
this point and this point.
And, you know, I was very quick to realize

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:08.819
that I was not naturally gifted as a cook,
which was one of the things I loved about

00:06:08.819 --> 00:06:13.409
cooking.
You don't have to be a super-star to become

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:16.939
a good cook or a great chef.
You just have to apply yourself.

00:06:16.939 --> 00:06:22.150
You have to be fully committed.
And when I sort of learned that -- I was learning

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:25.929
this, and I had the great mentors.
Craft was very, very important to me.

00:06:25.929 --> 00:06:33.449
Because, when Craft opened up, we had Jonathan
Benno, Mark Kinura, Octor Nuag, James Tracy.

00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:38.259
All these guys -- I mean people that will
never make it in the press.

00:06:38.259 --> 00:06:42.699
Like, I have a friend, Mac Kern.
He's a chef in Madrid in his own restaurant.

00:06:42.699 --> 00:06:47.110
Everyone that opened up that restaurant is
the chef at their own restaurant now, which

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:50.590
is very rare.
And they all took me under their wing and

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:53.819
beat the crap out of me.
And that's how you learn.

00:06:53.819 --> 00:07:01.580
And I learned quickly too that these guys
were better than me.

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:07.369
So every kitchen I ever went to, I was always
comparing myself to the best talent in the

00:07:07.369 --> 00:07:08.760
kitchen.
And I would be like, "Well, there's no way

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:14.020
I'm going to be better than this person."
It's a really weird way of looking at things.

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:22.369
But I'd learn as much as I could.
And, you know, someone asked me -- I was like,

00:07:22.369 --> 00:07:24.550
"What should I talk about?
I have no idea."

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:29.509
He said like, "What about opening up the restaurant
 -- the first restaurant?"

00:07:29.509 --> 00:07:36.551
Well, I had just got back from Japan, I think.
Part of the reason I came back from Japan

00:07:36.551 --> 00:07:44.509
was, my mom was battling cancer.
And I was having a hard time working at Cafe

00:07:44.509 --> 00:07:52.059
Bleu, and working for Andrew Carmellini, who's
now the chef at Locanda Verde, and who is

00:07:52.059 --> 00:07:56.939
probably one of the best chefs in America
and supremely, supremely talented.

00:07:56.939 --> 00:08:00.300
I was also just -- working in that kitchen,
I was like, "There's no way I'm going to be

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:03.439
as good as Andrew.
Why am I cooking in fine dining?

00:08:03.439 --> 00:08:09.429
Why am I on the Upper East Side cooking for,
you know, the audience that I could care less

00:08:09.429 --> 00:08:14.119
about?"
I care about the food, so I want to have the

00:08:14.119 --> 00:08:17.370
challenge of fine dining.
I want to have the pressure of fine dining.

00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:20.789
But why does this have to be in the environment
of fine dining?

00:08:20.789 --> 00:08:26.249
Something I didn't really put together till,
just about now, so.

00:08:26.249 --> 00:08:29.309
I left, and all these things started to happen,
right?

00:08:29.309 --> 00:08:33.420
Friends that passed away.
I was just in this weird spot, where I was

00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:39.159
just like, "I should be working at a new restaurant."
And 2004 was one of the greatest years in

00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:42.991
New York City culinary history.
You had Per Se open up, Mas opened up.

00:08:42.991 --> 00:08:47.810
Little bit later, you had Crew and Blue Hill
Stone Barns.

00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:51.940
All tremendous restaurants. Hearth opened
up.

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:57.730
So it was a strange time for someone like
myself, who had been cooking four-and-a-half

00:08:57.730 --> 00:09:02.440
 -- almost five -- years to be like, "Yeah,
I'm going to open up a Noodle Bar."

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:04.629
And everybody knew that I was crazy about
noodles.

00:09:04.629 --> 00:09:12.649
And I wanted to make ramen, you know.
I had a plan to go to Tokyo and learn how

00:09:12.649 --> 00:09:14.870
to make ramen.
But instead, I learned how to make all sorts

00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:19.350
of different things.
And that plan sort of fell flat on its face,

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:27.259
but it was a blessing in disguise.
So the reason I opened up the noodle bar was,

00:09:27.259 --> 00:09:32.160
I just needed to prove to myself that I could
do -- I could open up a restaurant.

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:39.699
At the time, I was just like -- it was a challenge.
It was something that I could sort of -- if

00:09:39.699 --> 00:09:50.580
I could open up a 600 square foot spot on
First Avenue on almost no budget, like $130,000

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:57.010
 -- that was my only goal.
The reason there is no -- there's a minimalist,

00:09:57.010 --> 00:10:01.480
and everything is plywood is not because we
were trying to be artistic.

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:09.100
We had no money. [laughter]
And there was other reasons why.

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:16.670
It was about a test to myself.
And that was the first and only goal I ever

00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:21.579
had for Momofuku, which is again why I pinch
myself every day for everything that's ever

00:10:21.579 --> 00:10:24.899
happened.
Which is why I'm so hard on myself and our

00:10:24.899 --> 00:10:30.120
crew, because I feel very blessed to be in
the position that we're in.

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:36.850
So that restaurant opened up, and we failed.
And we continue to fail.

00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:42.550
And those are two of the things that became
cornerstones of our restaurant -- at least

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:45.079
sort of our mantra.
It's like, "You know, if you're going to mess

00:10:45.079 --> 00:10:50.680
up, mess up big. Or just fuck up, but own
up to it."

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:56.959
And number two was, you know, be accountable
for your actions.

00:10:56.959 --> 00:11:03.089
No excuses, because no one's going to care.
No one cares if we're going to go out of business.

00:11:03.089 --> 00:11:10.389
So, you know, there were a lot of things going
on, and we were going to go out of business

00:11:10.389 --> 00:11:14.819
after six months/seven months.
So again, right place, right time.

00:11:14.819 --> 00:11:18.470
We're learning how to run a business.
I had a terrible business plan.

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:25.269
I didn't know how to run a business.
I didn't know how to run the cash register.

00:11:25.269 --> 00:11:29.399
You know, the only one person that wanted
to work with me was Joaquin Baca, because

00:11:29.399 --> 00:11:33.350
all my friends at the time were working at
these restaurants that were opening up.

00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:40.639
So I felt very slighted.
And things started to change.

00:11:40.639 --> 00:11:46.930
One thing happened, and awards started happening.
We became busier and busier.

00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:57.779
And the food really took a change right around
springtime when the market came around, the

00:11:57.779 --> 00:12:03.620
green market.
And I think it tied in with the size of the

00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:08.069
space, which is what I'm trying to get back
into the mode of thinking and how we do things

00:12:08.069 --> 00:12:16.040
at the restaurant, creatively speaking.
And again, it's been a progression of accidents.

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:19.300
And this is an accident.
I didn't plan to have this sort of philosophy

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:24.129
of how we create something.
But the first noodle bar, which is now Ko.

00:12:24.129 --> 00:12:27.269
And even Ko has its limitations.
It's 600 square feet.

00:12:27.269 --> 00:12:31.910
It's the size of a one-car garage.
Nobody in their right mind would open up a

00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:35.689
restaurant in 600 square feet.
I don't know what the hell I was thinking.

00:12:35.689 --> 00:12:38.290
But that's one of the beautiful things when
you're young and dumb.

00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:43.491
You don't know.
And I told myself, "Well, if I go out of business,

00:12:43.491 --> 00:12:48.480
I have the rest of my life to get out of bankruptcy.
I don't have a kid to feed.

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:53.649
I don't have a wife to take care of.
You know, let's go all in. Fuck it."

00:12:53.649 --> 00:12:58.379
So that's how -- we always get to this point
of like -- our backs are against the wall.

00:12:58.379 --> 00:13:03.149
And that's when sort of the adrenaline starts
pumping, and we start to make very bold, bold

00:13:03.149 --> 00:13:05.680
decisions.
It becomes more difficult when you become

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:12.810
a larger organization.
But, you know, Noodle Bar 600 square feet

00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:22.110
originally very limited in menu, about five
food items, mise en place, our "mise en place"

00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:28.839
in French means like basically the stuff you
prep out in a kitchen.

00:13:28.839 --> 00:13:34.509
It wasn't more than ten or 12 items.
So it'd be like scallions, bamboo shoots,

00:13:34.509 --> 00:13:39.889
pork shoulder, pork butt.
And when you only have so many ingredients,

00:13:39.889 --> 00:13:46.079
like five things to work with, after a while,
you just look at the same ingredients day

00:13:46.079 --> 00:13:49.610
after day, and you're just like, you're not
really thinking.

00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:52.319
And then, all of a sudden, things started
to click.

00:13:52.319 --> 00:13:57.800
It'd be like, "Oh, what if we batted."
We just -- it was almost like a Rubix Cube.

00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:01.540
If we just change this with this, then we
have a new dish.

00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:04.910
Then, we kept on evolving every day, changing
and changing.

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:10.850
And then, we created a foundation in terms
of what we wanted as a flavor profile.

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:14.310
Then, the green market happened.
And then, asparagus and ram started coming

00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:18.029
into the restaurant, which are the first signs
of spring.

00:14:18.029 --> 00:14:21.180
Rams are such a cliche in New York, but you
know what?

00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:26.740
Every spring, I get excited, because it's
the first thing, and they're so damn tasty.

00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:29.131
And it's the one thing that we have over the
West Coast.

00:14:29.131 --> 00:14:37.420
We have rams.
And, you know, so that added a new variable

00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:47.649
and food started to change and you become
very, very -- we were forced to be creative,

00:14:47.649 --> 00:14:53.879
because we had no other option.
Necessity is the mother of all invention they

00:14:53.879 --> 00:14:59.529
say.
And you really feel it when your accountant

00:14:59.529 --> 00:15:06.009
is like, "You're going to go out of business
in a month, unless you change certain things."

00:15:06.009 --> 00:15:09.999
And you don't want to let people down.
And for like, the first six months, I remember

00:15:09.999 --> 00:15:13.470
reporters or whoever -- journalists -- would
ask me like where I worked before.

00:15:13.470 --> 00:15:18.360
I wouldn't tell them, because I didn't want
to embarrass the people that I work for.

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:21.639
I didn't want to embarrass Mark Kinura, I
didn't want to embarrass Tom Colicchio.

00:15:21.639 --> 00:15:26.910
I didn't want to embarrass Jonathan Benno.
So I just told them, "Please don't mention

00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:30.649
where I worked."
And then, all of a sudden, it just became

00:15:30.649 --> 00:15:36.899
a life of its own.
And that's how Noodle Bar started.

00:15:36.899 --> 00:15:45.309
Nobody wanted to work with us.
And then, that really defined and paved the

00:15:45.309 --> 00:15:53.790
way and, you know, created the foundation
for how we did things in the future -- which

00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:58.100
is basically, make mistakes, grow organically.
You know?

00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:04.769
I say to the new Noodle Bar now -- I always
tell them, "If we serve fish and chips."

00:16:04.769 --> 00:16:09.029
Or like recently, I think we just served tamales
last night.

00:16:09.029 --> 00:16:14.360
And if we serve -- say, we become a tamale
restaurant, and that's all we serve.

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:18.589
And it's two years.
I'll be very happy, because it means that

00:16:18.589 --> 00:16:26.300
we took this weird, organic twist and turn
and, How come Momofuku Noodle Bar's only serving

00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:29.040
tamales?
'Cause it's weird, right? [laughter]

00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:32.629
But I would be very excited, because that
means everybody was involved in this process,

00:16:32.629 --> 00:16:36.619
and then, it evolved every day.
We didn't have this sort of game plan that,

00:16:36.619 --> 00:16:41.959
"You had to do this. You had to do that."
We didn't have a mission statement, you know?

00:16:41.959 --> 00:16:49.639
So that's been very difficult to sort of keep
this creative process of limiting your colors.

00:16:49.639 --> 00:16:54.569
And I found that, a lot of the chefs that
I admire around the world -- probably number

00:16:54.569 --> 00:16:58.639
one right now is this guy Rene Redzepi _______
Copenhagen.

00:16:58.639 --> 00:17:00.680
He's worked at El Vie.
He's worked at French Laundry.

00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:05.730
He's incredibly young, you know?
His restaurants rank third in the world -- from

00:17:05.730 --> 00:17:09.079
restaurant to restaurant magazine -- and it
deserves to be so.

00:17:09.079 --> 00:17:11.600
So, if you're ever in Copenhagen, check out
Noma.

00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:16.480
It's really, really amazing.
But he's pretty much set off what he can cook

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:19.770
with in terms of like, a hundred-kilometer
radius.

00:17:19.770 --> 00:17:25.329
And it's really interesting, because this
guy can cook anything he wants to.

00:17:25.329 --> 00:17:32.659
And it dawned on me how smart it was.
In the spring and summertime, he's preparing

00:17:32.659 --> 00:17:39.520
for the wintertime.
He has the ability to use -- to cook with,

00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:45.059
you know -- I could use a Crayola crayon box,
128 or whatever they come in -- He's chosen

00:17:45.059 --> 00:17:51.210
to really just cook with five colors.
And it's really amazing to see somebody push

00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:56.000
the culinary envelope with the most basic
of things.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:01.740
And there's some real genius behind that.
And when you put a ceiling on yourself, I

00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:05.659
find that that's when our best dishes come
about.

00:18:05.659 --> 00:18:09.760
When -- you know, right now, we're opening
a place in Midtown.

00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:15.820
And a lot of times, when we are -- and this
is another example.

00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:17.620
The chef that's going to be there -- I'm not
going to be the chef.

00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:23.460
I'm now into delegating.
Tien Ho's going to be the executive chef.

00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:26.240
We've been experiencing problems, because
we took over the space.

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:31.100
Because the kitchen in Midtown -- a place
called Ma Peche, which hopefully is going

00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:35.730
to open soon -- is huge.
It's enormous. I've never seen a kitchen this

00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:40.149
size.
I mean, our places are tiny.

00:18:40.149 --> 00:18:44.440
This place is -- we don't have.
We fight for storage -- this place, we can

00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:48.260
store stuff anywhere, and New York storage
is at a premium.

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:53.960
It took a while -- and again, it happened
at Noodle Bar too.

00:18:53.960 --> 00:19:00.760
When we moved Noodle Bar, and when we went
to Ma Peche, we had a kitchen that had every

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:07.260
toy possible.
And we just fucked it up, because we didn't

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:11.270
know what to do.
We got lazy.

00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:15.740
You get lazy when you have all these perks,
when you have a full range.

00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:21.399
You have all these equipment that works.
When you have nothing, you're just a little

00:19:21.399 --> 00:19:27.470
bit hungrier than the person that has everything.
And that's something that has really influenced

00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:34.190
our cooking, and is probably one of the things
 -- one of the sort of guiding principles

00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:37.250
in the restaurant that I'm trying to make
sure that everyone understands.

00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:44.059
Like the hungriest guy in the room -- the
guy with nothing to lose -- is the most dangerous

00:19:44.059 --> 00:19:47.549
person.
And that's the type of attitude we want.

00:19:47.549 --> 00:19:51.220
And you know, you don't have to be the best
cook in the world, but we want people with

00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:57.610
the high level of integrity that are willing
to just do whatever it takes.

00:19:57.610 --> 00:20:06.529
And it's much more difficult to find these
days. So, it's weird.

00:20:06.529 --> 00:20:11.250
You know, the creative process of cooking,
making dishes -- it's less about being in

00:20:11.250 --> 00:20:15.610
it and more about sort of being in the editing
role.

00:20:15.610 --> 00:20:18.990
Somebody told me this way back when.
And I was like, "I'm never going to get to

00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:21.250
that point."
And if I do get to that point, I wouldn't

00:20:21.250 --> 00:20:23.409
want to be that guy.
I'm that guy now.

00:20:23.409 --> 00:20:27.740
And you know, I want to get back into the
kitchen.

00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:33.890
I want to -- I keep on saying things like
that, but now, it's like a big organism.

00:20:33.890 --> 00:20:35.960
There was one person, and then there's two
people.

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:42.649
Now, we have what -- over 300 employees.
So, I have to decide what's best for -- not

00:20:42.649 --> 00:20:47.510
just myself -- but for everyone.
Could I spend all my time in the kitchen just

00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:50.130
doing R and D?
Yes, I'd love to do that.

00:20:50.130 --> 00:20:54.059
Do I want to speak to the public all the time?
Not particularly.

00:20:54.059 --> 00:21:02.559
Do I want to do a book tour? Not really, but
if -- I'll do whatever it takes for the greater

00:21:02.559 --> 00:21:08.610
good of the restaurant.
And so, there are younger cooks out there.

00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:12.840
And that's one of the things we realized,
or I realized, "If someone's better at something,

00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:19.179
instead of trying to be well, very competitive
about it, I'm just going to be like, 'Well,

00:21:19.179 --> 00:21:23.230
you are better at it, maybe I can learn something,
run with it.'"

00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:25.270
And that's what we try to do at our restaurant
and stuff.

00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:34.110
So the book we wrote with Peter -- who is
running to get markers, or maybe he's back

00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:42.169
 -- but Meehan was working in the New York
Times, and I had no idea that he -- well,

00:21:42.169 --> 00:21:51.649
that's another story, but.
We capture basically, from Day One of opening

00:21:51.649 --> 00:21:59.309
Noodle Bar 2004 to March 2008.
Regrettably, we don't have Milk Bar, because

00:21:59.309 --> 00:22:03.500
we just -- we needed to get the book into
the publisher.

00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:07.779
And Christina Tosi is going to work on her
own book, which is great.

00:22:07.779 --> 00:22:13.500
But it also documented -- like the menu at
Ko that's in the book is totally different

00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:15.299
now.
We're changing.

00:22:15.299 --> 00:22:19.380
We're constantly changing.
And that's what I sort of tell people at our

00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:23.040
restaurants that are making the menus, that
are cooking the food, you know, "People, we're

00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:26.360
over-hyped."
I mean, it's on every blog. I know it. I hate

00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:29.910
it.
I hate the fact that people come in expecting

00:22:29.910 --> 00:22:34.020
to have like, a really good meal.
[laughter]

00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:40.429
We want them to have a great meal, but that's
the challenge that is on us now.

00:22:40.429 --> 00:22:42.750
It's like, "Well, we have to live up to the
hype."

00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:51.179
And there's no better feeling than proving
someone wrong -- at least, for me it's.

00:22:51.179 --> 00:22:55.110
So when people enter our doors, whether it
be Noodle Bar, Ko, or Ssam Bar or Milk Bar

00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:57.750
being like, they want to come in hating this
place.

00:22:57.750 --> 00:23:03.919
I think we all know what this is like -- whether
it's the football team, a band, an author,

00:23:03.919 --> 00:23:07.049
or whatever.
Something that gets hyped up so much where

00:23:07.049 --> 00:23:09.570
you're like -- it's almost like human nature
now.

00:23:09.570 --> 00:23:15.830
You just want to hate it.
It's our goal to make you feel wrong -- to

00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:20.940
make you feel that you leave the place being
like, "I'm glad I spent my money there.

00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:27.110
That was worth everything that people have
been talking about."

00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:33.031
And that's one of the things too.
So, out of that first restaurant came a lot

00:23:33.031 --> 00:23:36.799
of the core principles from how we run our
business today.

00:23:36.799 --> 00:23:44.690
And, you know, it was probably -- one of the
most important things is, I'm never happy

00:23:44.690 --> 00:23:48.660
with the status quo.
If you're just meeting expectations, you're

00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:51.919
failing.
And I want us to constantly be changing, which

00:23:51.919 --> 00:23:56.100
is why like, if Noodle Bar turned into a tamale
shop, I'd be very happy.

00:23:56.100 --> 00:24:00.730
That means we're tinkering every day -- we're
messing around with something.

00:24:00.730 --> 00:24:07.690
So yeah, it's been a crazy trip.
And the reason we wrote the book, quite honestly

00:24:07.690 --> 00:24:12.720
 -- besides publishers asking us -- was, I
always have this fear that everything's going

00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:18.362
to fall apart; everything is going to end.
And I really thought, at that time we were

00:24:18.362 --> 00:24:22.070
writing the book, that we wouldn't be around
in a month or a year.

00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:26.080
Because there's so many variables; there's
so many things going on.

00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:28.720
And the economy was bad.
I was just like, "Well, this has been such

00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:32.320
a crazy ride, we might as well get talking
about this."

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:35.570
So, that's why the book is written the way
it is.

00:24:35.570 --> 00:24:41.100
And I think Peter Meehan did a great job.
And we had an amazing photographer in Gabriele

00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:46.409
Stabile, which was impossible.
Imagine going to Clarkson Potter, a division

00:24:46.409 --> 00:24:51.860
of Random House known for doing Martha Stewart
cookbooks and Food Network cookbooks and retail

00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:54.390
them.
Yeah, they gave us a list of photographers

00:24:54.390 --> 00:25:01.260
they wanted to use, and we gave them our list.
Richard won, and he's never shot food before

00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:09.250
in his life, but he's a photo journalist that
had done stories of war, poverty, and famine.

00:25:09.250 --> 00:25:16.910
[Laughter] His portfolio wasn't necessarily
the thing that cookbook publishers go giddy

00:25:16.910 --> 00:25:25.899
about, but I think Gabriele did a great job
and it's a real testament to him and everyone

00:25:25.899 --> 00:25:31.380
in the entire crew, so.
If you like the book, it's because of the

00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:36.799
people that were behind it and the team effort.
I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for the team

00:25:36.799 --> 00:25:39.460
that are cooking at the restaurants right
now.

00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:46.090
So I'm incredibly lucky to be here and to
be talking to you all.

00:25:46.090 --> 00:25:50.120
This is very, again -- surreal.
This whole thing is very surreal.

00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:56.169
So, enough of me rambling on.
I think we'll go to Q and A.

00:25:56.169 --> 00:26:00.169
Don't give me tough questions.
Your colleagues on the West Coast gave me

00:26:00.169 --> 00:26:01.539
tough, tough questions.
[laughter]

00:26:01.539 --> 00:26:11.630
Q I have one for you.
I was curious -- there was this point, you

00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:15.370
said, when you were about to go out of business,
right?

00:26:15.370 --> 00:26:21.630
And you had a month of budget left, right?
I'm curious like, What made the switch from

00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:29.040
the the failure that you felt you had for
six months and then, you know, the success

00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:32.659
that kept you going after that?
You know, in that month time, when you were

00:26:32.659 --> 00:26:39.190
just about to fail, what was the switch?
Was it just the constant, hard work you poured

00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:42.720
into it in the six month?
It was just kind of like a slow accumulation

00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:47.730
to some sort of crescendo?
Or was it, you think, a stroke of luck that

00:26:47.730 --> 00:26:50.990
kept you going that month?
Or was it some like, act of desperation you

00:26:50.990 --> 00:26:55.309
managed to pull out of thin air that you said,
when you were backed into the corner?

00:26:55.309 --> 00:26:56.309
Like, what was that?

00:26:56.309 --> 00:26:59.662
A We really pulled it on over our ass -- that's
what I would say.

00:26:59.662 --> 00:27:04.590
I think it's all of the above.
It was the right timing -- right place, right

00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:07.330
time.
Our restaurant? Right place, right time.

00:27:07.330 --> 00:27:10.330
When we opened up our stuff ten years ago,
we wouldn't be here.

00:27:10.330 --> 00:27:17.070
Yeah, it was all those things.
It was an act of desperation, and it was the

00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:22.469
right timing; it was the season.
I think one of the big factors in that change

00:27:22.469 --> 00:27:26.889
 -- that happened for the better -- was, we
started to learn how to run the business,

00:27:26.889 --> 00:27:29.750
you know?
I didn't have to ask questions about the cash

00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:32.190
register.
And we learned that like -- we were an all

00:27:32.190 --> 00:27:40.279
cash business for the first six months.
And then, we were like, "Wait a second. We

00:27:40.279 --> 00:27:43.880
should take credit cards."
[laughter] It's like, 'duh'. You know?

00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:46.880
Little things that you don't think about.
Because like, credit cards -- people are going

00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:52.299
to spend more money, you know?
For whatever reason, there's only a handful

00:27:52.299 --> 00:27:56.399
of institutions that are all cash businesses
and they do well at it.

00:27:56.399 --> 00:28:00.860
Because people know beforehand, "I have to
go into this restaurant with a huge wad of

00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:05.880
cash" -- like Lugers -- "or I'm screwed."
Nobody knew who the hell we were, and we expected

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:08.640
them to pay cash.
So people would be like, "You don't take credit

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:11.059
cards?"
So that was -- little things like that, so.

00:28:11.059 --> 00:28:16.159
It would be like a hundred little things like
that, that see?

00:28:16.159 --> 00:28:19.539
We did not know how to run a business.
I'm not joking.

00:28:19.539 --> 00:28:20.991
And it was like, "Oh, yeah. We take credit
cards."

00:28:20.991 --> 00:28:26.470
And all of a sudden, booze sales went up,
and people were buying more food.

00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:32.490
And I was -- we weren't messing it up -- a
drawer at the end of the night, because everything

00:28:32.490 --> 00:28:38.080
was all computerized and nice.
But, the dream of opening up that restaurant

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:39.990
was to keep it simple, like a Mom-and-Pop
store.

00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:47.440
In a Mom-and-Pop store, I guess you can do
that.

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:54.580
But we were understaffed, and we finally -- and
another reason why is, we started to get help.

00:28:54.580 --> 00:29:00.679
People started to work for us.
We had a very high turn-over rate the first

00:29:00.679 --> 00:29:01.679
year, so.

00:29:01.679 --> 00:29:03.620
&gt;&gt; [pause]

00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:13.110
Q Hi. Thanks for coming.
I live down the block from Ssam Bar and Milk

00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:16.509
and Honey.
So thanks for the extra five pounds. [laughter]

00:29:16.509 --> 00:29:21.809
And noticed recently at Ssam Bar that there's
been like, a lot more cocktails on the menu,

00:29:21.809 --> 00:29:25.760
and they're really good.
Is that an area that you guys are thinking

00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:27.700
about expanding?
Have you ever thought about going into the

00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:28.700
bar business?

00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:34.540
David Chang: Yeah, I think about going into
the bar business all the time.

00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:39.110
I think that's every -- if you talk to most
cooks and you ask them like, "What do you

00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:43.490
want to open up?"
They'll tell you, "A pub" or "A bar" or "Sandwich

00:29:43.490 --> 00:29:49.600
shop", something that's just like very easy.
Not that it's easy -- that's the problem.

00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:57.800
Nothing's easy.
We had a liquor permit, and we got a hard

00:29:57.800 --> 00:30:02.240
liquor license finally.
And again, it just sort of happened.

00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:09.309
My friend, Don Kim -- who worked at PDT -- was
available, and we were like, "Let's go."

00:30:09.309 --> 00:30:18.519
He's very talented, and I was just like -- we
sort of create the, you know, "How big the

00:30:18.519 --> 00:30:21.220
sandbox is."
And you can do whatever it is, as long as

00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:26.630
you don't play outside that sandbox.
Then you won't get in trouble.

00:30:26.630 --> 00:30:38.490
So, we have a cocktail program, and it's working.
So yeah. Opening up a bar would be a lot of

00:30:38.490 --> 00:30:41.660
fun.
Bars make money. Restaurants don't.

00:30:41.660 --> 00:30:49.790
Q Hi. I also live like, right across the street
from Ssam Bar.

00:30:49.790 --> 00:30:52.200
So thanks. It's delicious.
Can you talk -- just for as long as you want

00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:54.820
 -- about how you make like, pork buns so
good? [laughter]

00:30:54.820 --> 00:31:01.990
How do you make the pork so soft, and fat
taste good, and the bun part is in it?

00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:03.960
It's just the whole thing.

00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:08.080
David Chang: Well, one of the things -- we'll
talk about pork.

00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:11.559
And you know everyone's like, "Oh, you became
this pork guy."

00:31:11.559 --> 00:31:16.289
Well, no. We open a ramen shop and ramen is
pork-based.

00:31:16.289 --> 00:31:20.820
And it wasn't my intention to have all this
pork.

00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:33.340
But pork, for a lot of people, has traditionally
been commodity raised, not pork, in confinement.

00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:37.320
And you know, the other white meat.
Pork's not supposed to be white meat.

00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:44.960
It's not, at all.
So, I liken it to drinking tang vs. freshly

00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:52.309
squeezed orange juice -- that much of a difference.
So if anything, if our pork buns are delicious,

00:31:52.309 --> 00:31:56.650
it's because of the pork we're using.
And all we're doing is cooking it very slowly

00:31:56.650 --> 00:32:00.220
 -- slow roast.
And you know, you could put that same pork

00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:04.820
in between some Wonder bread, and you'll have
a tasty sandwich.

00:32:04.820 --> 00:32:16.179
So I think a lot of it has to do with the
product we're using.

00:32:16.179 --> 00:32:17.179
&gt;&gt; [pause]

00:32:17.179 --> 00:32:18.399
Q Hi. I too live in the neighborhood.
I live between Noodle Bar and the Ssam.

00:32:18.399 --> 00:32:22.960
So it's like wonderful choice.
My question's about the huge awesome photo

00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:25.110
of the band that you have.
What's up with that?

00:32:25.110 --> 00:32:28.629
It's like the first thing I noticed when I
walked into the noodle bar.

00:32:28.629 --> 00:32:29.760
Can you talk about that?

00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:37.059
David Chang: Yeah, it's very large.
At the noodle bar, we have this big photo

00:32:37.059 --> 00:32:42.790
of the band from the -- it's on the inside
cover of the big pink from the band -- they

00:32:42.790 --> 00:32:47.000
used to tour Dillon.
And if you're not familiar with them -- one

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:53.300
of my favorite bands of all time.
And for whatever reason, I was like, "I love

00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:57.909
that photo.
I'm going to find a way to get that." And

00:32:57.909 --> 00:33:00.620
yeah.
I'm not concerned with the interior or anything

00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:05.639
else or all these other things going on, but
I was like, "We have to get this photo."

00:33:05.639 --> 00:33:10.200
So if you notice, out of all these restaurants,
we have a big John McEnroe at Ssam Bar.

00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:17.779
Totally random. I do love John McEnroe.
But besides that, it's just totally random,

00:33:17.779 --> 00:33:20.259
and it's funny.
I mean, you go to restaurants and you see

00:33:20.259 --> 00:33:25.450
pictures, you know, that are totally everything
random and then arbitrary too, like, "Great.

00:33:25.450 --> 00:33:30.610
You have a picture of an apple on the wall.
What the hell's that? You're in a restaurant.

00:33:30.610 --> 00:33:34.389
Why not just put something random?"
So that's why.

00:33:34.389 --> 00:33:37.190
And the band, for me though, was much more
of a team effort.

00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:41.080
That was the first time we actually put something
on the wall that had some type of significant

00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:48.080
 -- or symbolic meaning or metaphor.
Because everyone in that band could play every

00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:53.640
instrument, and they edited the process.
Every every song got ripped part.

00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:59.389
And that's what made them so very successful.
And it took a long time working with Elliott

00:33:59.389 --> 00:34:07.360
Landy, the photographer who's in Woodstock
 -- very, very long time -- took about a year

00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:08.360
to get that photo right.
So.

00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:10.720
Q [inaudible]

00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:15.880
David Chang: No, no, no. He didn't care about
it.

00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:24.540
Elliott Landy, he's a very successful photographer.
He just -- he was more concerned about his

00:34:24.540 --> 00:34:29.310
photo being -- making sure we weren't going
to sully his reputation, so.

00:34:29.310 --> 00:34:37.530
Q So I live in Brooklyn, no where near any
of your restaurants, but I did check out the

00:34:37.530 --> 00:34:39.490
Ko and I had --

00:34:39.490 --> 00:34:41.560
David Chang: Glad you could get in.

00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:46.170
Q Yes, I got in. And it was definitely a culinary
adventure.

00:34:46.170 --> 00:34:50.300
So right around like probably the seventh
or eighth course, I wasn't sure I was going

00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:54.460
to make it to however many there was, like
13 or something like that.

00:34:54.460 --> 00:35:01.930
So what made you kind of go with that many
courses and kind of the concept behind that?

00:35:01.930 --> 00:35:09.070
David Chang: So Noodle Bar -- transformation.
So Noodle Bar was 600 square feet.

00:35:09.070 --> 00:35:11.700
We did 27 seats, and we would do 300 covers
a day.

00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:16.530
So that's like about turn and a half on an
average day.

00:35:16.530 --> 00:35:19.090
It just wore out.
The only way -- we had the lease when we moved

00:35:19.090 --> 00:35:24.990
into Noodle Bar, the only way we could keep
this restaurant -- keep it as a restaurant

00:35:24.990 --> 00:35:30.050
 -- was to do fewer covers.
And that number was 12.

00:35:30.050 --> 00:35:37.770
So it allowed us to do multiple course tastings.
So that's why we did dinners ten courses and

00:35:37.770 --> 00:35:43.710
lunch, you know, was only one seating.
So we could do 17 courses.

00:35:43.710 --> 00:35:51.240
Which I think -- it's a lot, but if you go
to a lot of these like, recently I had like

00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:56.410
a seven-and-a-half course dinner and it was
47 courses.

00:35:56.410 --> 00:36:02.110
And, you know, we can't do that.
But we thought that 17 was about the right

00:36:02.110 --> 00:36:04.980
number and ten was about the right number
for dinner.

00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:10.970
And it also has to do with the timing.
Dinner, we have to turn the tables once.

00:36:10.970 --> 00:36:17.790
So that's the reason why.
It was a certain price point and we can't

00:36:17.790 --> 00:36:24.060
just do three courses, so.
Hopefully you had a good time.

00:36:24.060 --> 00:36:28.450
Q Hi. I have two questions actually.
One is, how much cooking do you actually still

00:36:28.450 --> 00:36:32.120
do?
And the second question is not for me.

00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:34.260
I am not vegetarian.
I never wish to be vegetarian, but I do have

00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:35.260
friends who are.
And we --

00:36:35.260 --> 00:36:36.260
David Chang: I'm sorry.

00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:37.260
Q No, it's really hard.

00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:40.370
David Chang: I'm sorry, because it's a pain
in the ass for friends organizing.

00:36:40.370 --> 00:36:50.070
Q So this is the thing, right?
When you talk about the Ssam dinner, it was

00:36:50.070 --> 00:36:52.540
six meat-eaters.
And the title of the e-mail I think was actually

00:36:52.540 --> 00:36:56.450
"meat feast."
We now have a meat club where we have picked

00:36:56.450 --> 00:37:01.030
another restaurant to go to, to eat more meat.
But -- not that I wish to exclude my vegetarian

00:37:01.030 --> 00:37:05.080
friends -- but I was just interested to know
what your thoughts on vegetarianism were.

00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:10.671
And I know there are probably vegans and vegetarians
like staring dagger eyes at me right now.

00:37:10.671 --> 00:37:13.970
But also if you had any intention of having
something else that was more vegetarian.

00:37:13.970 --> 00:37:20.960
For me, I know that like, even Noodle Bar
is not recommended for vegetarians.

00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:24.110
It actually says that on some of the menus,
which I think is kind of cute.

00:37:24.110 --> 00:37:25.110
David Chang: What was the first part of the
question you asked?

00:37:25.110 --> 00:37:26.840
Q The first question was, How much cooking
do you do?

00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:31.890
And the second question was, How much do you
hate vegetarians? [laughter]

00:37:31.890 --> 00:37:36.410
David Chang: Right now, I'm not cooking that
much.

00:37:36.410 --> 00:37:40.930
And I don't like working behind the line at
the restaurants that are all open.

00:37:40.930 --> 00:37:43.010
I thought Ko would be the last project I would
work on.

00:37:43.010 --> 00:37:48.280
But it got a little too intimate, and I don't
want to yell at the guests.

00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:54.450
I've done that before when we first opened
up, because I get a little too 'into' it.

00:37:54.450 --> 00:37:58.060
And for health reasons too, I get a little
too 'into' it.

00:37:58.060 --> 00:38:04.300
My stress level gets a little too high.
And, for many reasons, I'm spending less time

00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:09.650
physically cooking, but hopefully that's going
to be -- in a few months I'm going to be able

00:38:09.650 --> 00:38:16.360
to channel that energy into a different way.
But right now, I'm doing the book tour.

00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:20.311
And you know, I keep my hands in the kitchen,
but not as much.

00:38:20.311 --> 00:38:25.670
In terms of the -- not as much as I'd like.
That's a whole -- we could spend all day talking

00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:31.840
about my problems with that.
But in terms of vegetarians, I have nothing

00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:35.530
against them.
And the reason why we don't serve vegetarians

00:38:35.530 --> 00:38:40.060
 -- or have vegetarian friendly menus -- is
because we're New York City.

00:38:40.060 --> 00:38:46.440
There's thousands of restaurants.
So, you don't go to a Sushi Yasuda, or Masa

00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:53.600
and ask for a vegetarian menu.
You don't go to Peter Lugers and ask for tempeh.

00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:58.260
You don't go to, you know, I'm just, Why do
we have to cater to everybody?

00:38:58.260 --> 00:39:04.650
[laughter] Seriously. Like, Why do we have
to cater to everybody?

00:39:04.650 --> 00:39:09.680
I mean, it's not like we don't love vegetables.
I love vegetables. I love cooking with vegetables.

00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:16.130
But it just sort of became one of those things.
Why do we have to create an extra menu?

00:39:16.130 --> 00:39:21.300
That's sort of how it happened, and I have
nothing against vegetarians and vegans.

00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:27.530
I mean, a lot of my friends from college are
vegetarians now.

00:39:27.530 --> 00:39:34.750
And I just think it's ironic that, you know,
they're not going to eat something on the

00:39:34.750 --> 00:39:37.770
menu that's maybe local.
I was at a wedding, and I got in a big fight

00:39:37.770 --> 00:39:43.600
with all my friends -- with one of them.
And it was a local lobster, it was local vegetables

00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:49.610
and local everything.
But, no, no -- all the protein was local,

00:39:49.610 --> 00:39:54.460
but all the vegetables were from all around
the universe.

00:39:54.460 --> 00:40:00.020
But he wouldn't eat something that was caught
within a hundred yards.

00:40:00.020 --> 00:40:04.960
And he was like, "It's all about protecting
the environment. Being green."

00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:10.880
And all this stuff -- which I'm all for, but
I'm like, "Dude, your entire plate is carrots

00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:19.880
from Chile, asparagus from Peru, and I think
you're doing more harm by not."

00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:22.540
He's like, "Well, I don't want to hurt a centian
thing."

00:40:22.540 --> 00:40:29.540
But I was like, "Well, if you're not supporting
your local farmers or your local -- just people

00:40:29.540 --> 00:40:33.140
that are making food locally, I think that
makes more sense."

00:40:33.140 --> 00:40:41.120
So if you're going to be a vegetarian, eat
what's within, you know, walking distance

00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:44.400
or driving distance.
So I could go -- again, that's a whole another

00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:45.400
topic, sorry.

00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:53.280
Q Hi, David. I'm a big fan of your food.
I've not had a chance to try your Ko restaurant,

00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:58.531
because the website appears to always be blocked
off with reservations.

00:40:58.531 --> 00:41:03.060
I was wondering if maybe there's another like,
secret way to get a reservation?

00:41:03.060 --> 00:41:08.330
[laughter] Or if there's a coupon book?

00:41:08.330 --> 00:41:13.890
David Chang: I figured you guys could just
crack into our computer system.

00:41:13.890 --> 00:41:22.270
[laughter] Yeah. I'm surprised that it hasn't
happened.

00:41:22.270 --> 00:41:27.460
Really, it's not that complicated. [laughter]
Whoever made it, it's not that complicated.

00:41:27.460 --> 00:41:38.490
And no, there aren't any secrets.
It's, you know, try later in the afternoon,

00:41:38.490 --> 00:41:43.770
and try on Sundays and weekends and holidays.
You know, it's 12 seats.

00:41:43.770 --> 00:41:49.350
We're very lucky that we're still busy and
people want to eat there, so.

00:41:49.350 --> 00:41:53.570
Yeah, I try. It's totally ridiculous process.
[laughter]

00:41:53.570 --> 00:41:58.670
I was like, I have the patience of a five-year-old.
There's no -- I was just like no.

00:41:58.670 --> 00:42:00.781
I can't even do it, so.

00:42:00.781 --> 00:42:09.520
Q Hi, I was really interested to hear you
talk about the craft of making food, working

00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:12.620
with your hands.
And I've never cooked professionally, but

00:42:12.620 --> 00:42:20.180
the two times I've cooked either a lot of
food in a row or for a lot of people, it was

00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:25.630
 -- one time was for a group that was consistent.
So we were making the food, but I think what

00:42:25.630 --> 00:42:31.170
we created was really like the love of the
continued experience and the repeat meals

00:42:31.170 --> 00:42:34.340
with the same group.
And the other was because we're putting as

00:42:34.340 --> 00:42:37.630
much energy into the food, but I didn't feel
like we were getting the same thing back,

00:42:37.630 --> 00:42:41.260
because the people tasting -- or the people
evaluating it -- kept changing.

00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:46.710
So, for you, is it the craft of making meal
or is it the craft of building a restaurant

00:42:46.710 --> 00:42:48.150
or somewhere in between?

00:42:48.150 --> 00:42:59.200
David Chang: It's all of the above, and it's
also, you know, tasting, you know, making

00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:05.880
something with your hands and like, taking
the carrot and transforming a raw carrot into

00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:11.600
like carrot paper.
That's a lot of work, and that's something

00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:16.350
 -- you can see that -- that's one thing about
cooking, where you can see the process from

00:43:16.350 --> 00:43:20.510
'raw' to 'finished' in one day.
Or, if not one day, you had the pleasure of

00:43:20.510 --> 00:43:25.531
say, making duck prosciutto or ham, for instance.
I'll never forget like, when I made my first

00:43:25.531 --> 00:43:28.330
prosciutto.
Did it come out great? No.

00:43:28.330 --> 00:43:32.670
But it was like nine months.
And it was just like waiting, waiting, waiting.

00:43:32.670 --> 00:43:41.150
And you break down the hog, and you do it.
And that process is wonderful and beautiful.

00:43:41.150 --> 00:43:46.980
That's sort of what I call 'craft,' so.

00:43:46.980 --> 00:43:51.190
Q Thanks for coming.
How do you -- one of the things you were talking

00:43:51.190 --> 00:43:59.650
about was hunger and success and I guess,
wondering how you guys reconcile success and

00:43:59.650 --> 00:44:06.690
continued pursuit of success and growth -- more
restaurants, cookbooks, etc -- with trying

00:44:06.690 --> 00:44:12.570
to artificially or actually instill the hunger
that is required to take all the risks and

00:44:12.570 --> 00:44:13.570
do cool stuff, you know?
I mean, I guess it's more -- it's not just

00:44:13.570 --> 00:44:18.550
a lesson for cooking; it could be said of
places like Google.

00:44:18.550 --> 00:44:23.370
You know, how to raise a child, any of that
stuff.

00:44:23.370 --> 00:44:28.010
So I'm just kind of interested in your take
on, "Now, you've made it, how do you keep

00:44:28.010 --> 00:44:29.420
yourself and your folks honest?"

00:44:29.420 --> 00:44:33.980
David Chang: Well, by never thinking that
we've made it.

00:44:33.980 --> 00:44:43.160
Don't believe that you ever made it.
I'm weirdly paranoid like that.

00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:48.900
If you start resting on your laurels, you're
screwed basically.

00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:54.120
Don't believe the hype. Don't believe anything.
You have to be your harshest critic, and you

00:44:54.120 --> 00:45:00.410
have to be constantly improving, so.
It's very hard to do.

00:45:00.410 --> 00:45:07.060
And telling you right now, I'm having a hard
time trying to make sure that is happening.

00:45:07.060 --> 00:45:13.220
And I think that's -- I guess that's something
that every company has to struggle with, so

00:45:13.220 --> 00:45:15.570
I'm figuring that out myself.

00:45:15.570 --> 00:45:16.570
Q Thanks.

00:45:16.570 --> 00:45:20.400
David Chang: Thanks.

00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:29.530
Q Just another question about the reservation
system [laughter] I've actually haven't had

00:45:29.530 --> 00:45:32.790
any problems.
I've been to Ko twice already. [laughter]

00:45:32.790 --> 00:45:34.640
Anyways.
I was just curious, What was the intent when

00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:36.650
you decided to come up with your reservation
system?

00:45:36.650 --> 00:45:40.140
And do you actually think that it's worked
out and done what you wanted it to do?

00:45:40.140 --> 00:45:45.440
This is something you wanted to do again in
the future with another restaurant?

00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:50.050
David Chang: Well, we have -- we did it because
it's 12 seats.

00:45:50.050 --> 00:45:57.740
And we hire an employee to answer the phone.
That's what? -- 35 minimum, $40,000 a year.

00:45:57.740 --> 00:46:02.590
Why? For 12 seats.
And then, it would just become sort of a club

00:46:02.590 --> 00:46:07.850
for like, friends.
And it would just be process.

00:46:07.850 --> 00:46:13.230
I get bogged down at least 30 minutes of my
day, "Hey Dave, can you get me a table?" You

00:46:13.230 --> 00:46:14.750
know, these are friends that you have to do
it.

00:46:14.750 --> 00:46:20.900
And I wanted this place and the cooks and
chefs that work there to be free from anything

00:46:20.900 --> 00:46:26.280
other than just focusing on the food.
And if they were free from the B.S. of trying

00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:32.340
to get reservations for friends, then that
was one big step that I could take off their

00:46:32.340 --> 00:46:36.350
plate.
One big pile of shit they didn't have to deal

00:46:36.350 --> 00:46:41.010
with.
And yeah, it's -- has it worked out perfectly?

00:46:41.010 --> 00:46:43.990
No.
But it's worked out in the sense that we wanted

00:46:43.990 --> 00:46:48.180
to create a fair and equal place where anyone
could eat.

00:46:48.180 --> 00:46:51.760
It sucks when chefs come into town or friends
come into town, and they can't plan -- of

00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:55.910
course we want people to eat there, but it's
12 seats and we didn't.

00:46:55.910 --> 00:46:58.900
I wanted it independent, because I also didn't
want to get clobbered with like, "Hey, Dave,

00:46:58.900 --> 00:47:03.150
can you get me a seat?"
I'm like, "Sorry, man, I can't. It's independent

00:47:03.150 --> 00:47:08.040
of me."
So, people don't believe me, but that's just

00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:10.660
the way it is.
And yes, it sort of worked.

00:47:10.660 --> 00:47:15.090
We've applied it to our Bo Ssam reservations,
our fried chicken, and who knows what's going

00:47:15.090 --> 00:47:17.150
to happen, so.
That's again, it's one of the those things

00:47:17.150 --> 00:47:26.310
that was sort of 'on a lark' and it just happened.
And again, the primary reason was, "Why the

00:47:26.310 --> 00:47:29.470
hell do we need one person answering the phone
for 12 seats?

00:47:29.470 --> 00:47:35.880
Can we find an easier way?"
So that was how it came about.

00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:37.290
Q Thanks.

00:47:37.290 --> 00:47:43.010
Q Hi there. I also had a question about the
reservation system.

00:47:43.010 --> 00:47:46.940
No, really. I was wondering if you could talk
a bit about your inspiration.

00:47:46.940 --> 00:47:53.010
You cook some very unusual dishes, and I was
wondering where you get inspired to make those?

00:47:53.010 --> 00:47:57.770
David Chang: Usually in an altered state.
[laughter]

00:47:57.770 --> 00:48:06.450
No, a lot of the times, it's eating at another
restaurant or just -- a lot of times just

00:48:06.450 --> 00:48:09.720
messing around with food.
That's what I was saying, it's hard to create

00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:14.800
food when you're not physically touching it.
I thought I could be, you know, theoretically

00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:18.650
 -- or just like messing around with food
in my head, but for me, I've learned that

00:48:18.650 --> 00:48:24.290
I have to be touching with food.
I have to be the one making mistakes.

00:48:24.290 --> 00:48:29.320
So, that's one of the reasons why it's been
very difficult transition for me to not be

00:48:29.320 --> 00:48:33.120
handling food and making recipes and stuff
like that.

00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:36.770
I need to work with food. I just can't think
about food.

00:48:36.770 --> 00:48:42.990
I can write about food.
I can think about food, or I can do it, but

00:48:42.990 --> 00:48:47.290
the glue that puts it all together is, for
me, touching the food and working with food,

00:48:47.290 --> 00:48:50.610
so.
That's just my process.

00:48:50.610 --> 00:48:52.970
Everyone has their own unique way. That's
mine.

00:48:52.970 --> 00:48:59.260
I have to take a shotgun approach at food
and just see what sticks on the wall, so.

00:48:59.260 --> 00:49:06.700
Q So I actually do have a question about the
reservation system.

00:49:06.700 --> 00:49:10.640
Is it actually true that your parents couldn't
even get a reservation?

00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:13.570
David Chang: Well, they had their chance to
come with their friends and family.

00:49:13.570 --> 00:49:20.460
They couldn't make it. [laughter]
And I felt that -- and I still feel this way

00:49:20.460 --> 00:49:29.331
very strongly that -- if I show favoritism,
then it just undermines the reservation system

00:49:29.331 --> 00:49:33.390
and it undermines what we're trying to do
to all of our managers and the people that

00:49:33.390 --> 00:49:37.070
work at our restaurants.
I never want to be in a position where we

00:49:37.070 --> 00:49:41.970
take from our employees.
And I feel that, you know, just because we

00:49:41.970 --> 00:49:45.940
set this reservation system, I want to keep
my word and say like, "Yeah."

00:49:45.940 --> 00:49:50.430
So they did have to wait a year.
My sister wound up getting them a reservation.

00:49:50.430 --> 00:49:54.570
Did I feel like a jerk? Yes.
But again, it was the lesser of two evils

00:49:54.570 --> 00:49:56.830
for me.
It was like, "I would rather have them do

00:49:56.830 --> 00:50:05.180
it the right way, than to go out and."
Then, I'd have to do it for everybody, so.

00:50:05.180 --> 00:50:09.470
That's why. So it is true. So I am a jerk.
[laughter]

00:50:09.470 --> 00:50:16.290
Q Just a question about your recommendations
for other restaurants you love in the city.

00:50:16.290 --> 00:50:17.960
Particularly cheap eats.

00:50:17.960 --> 00:50:24.080
David Chang: I love -- it's a well-known fact,
I love All Grand Schezwan Internationals.

00:50:24.080 --> 00:50:32.290
You have one on 23rd and Nineth Avenue, I
believe, and Chinatown.

00:50:32.290 --> 00:50:41.320
Cheap eats, though, I usually stick to Chinese
food, not that it's cheap, but I don't know.

00:50:41.320 --> 00:50:47.780
If I had my choice, I'd really like us to
have the Mission from San Francisco in New

00:50:47.780 --> 00:50:50.660
York City somehow.
That would be great cheap eats.

00:50:50.660 --> 00:50:51.660
Q Great, thanks. Another idea?

00:50:51.660 --> 00:51:04.590
David Chang: Yeah, working on it.

00:51:04.590 --> 00:51:08.850
Q Last week, there was a massive Twitter that
went around your, I guess, documentary on

00:51:08.850 --> 00:51:09.850
like, vbs.tv?

00:51:09.850 --> 00:51:10.980
David Chang: Yeah.

00:51:10.980 --> 00:51:15.390
Q It was truly amazing, and I loved the cameo
of Gary Vaynerchuk at the end of it.

00:51:15.390 --> 00:51:19.170
Is that part of a bigger documentary that
you're doing, or was it just this one little

00:51:19.170 --> 00:51:20.170
clip?

00:51:20.170 --> 00:51:26.990
David Chang: It was one random thing, yes.
That's a one shot deal. And yes.

00:51:26.990 --> 00:51:32.740
That basically documents the state of how
drunk I am throughout the night, so. [laughter]

00:51:32.740 --> 00:51:43.500
Q I hope somebody in Mountain View asks this,
but when are you going to open up

00:51:43.500 --> 00:51:45.210
something in San Francisco?

00:51:45.210 --> 00:51:51.670
David Chang: Probably not.
Not that I don't want -- I love San Francisco.

00:51:51.670 --> 00:51:56.540
[laughter]
It's funny how things become these like, lightning-rod

00:51:56.540 --> 00:52:01.580
things that like, that could be now on a blog
or something and like I get, "Dave trashes

00:52:01.580 --> 00:52:08.090
San Francisco again" blah blah blah.
[laughter] Such bullshit.

00:52:08.090 --> 00:52:15.110
I wouldn't do it, because I think that it's
very difficult to operate a business in San

00:52:15.110 --> 00:52:18.570
Francisco.
I think it's wonderful that all restaurants

00:52:18.570 --> 00:52:25.160
have to provide health insurance for their
employees.

00:52:25.160 --> 00:52:29.100
I think it's great.
And I think it's great that, you know, it's

00:52:29.100 --> 00:52:31.941
mandatory.
What I don't think is great is that you have

00:52:31.941 --> 00:52:37.670
to pay minimum wage to servers that are anywhere
from 9.50 to 10.50 an hour.

00:52:37.670 --> 00:52:45.170
They're bringing home, you know, on a 30-hour
work week maybe sixty, seventy thousand dollars.

00:52:45.170 --> 00:52:52.430
I think that's unfair to do that, but you
know there's a lot of bureaucracy in San Francisco

00:52:52.430 --> 00:52:58.540
that I find to be -- I just couldn't open
up a restaurant -- in San Francisco proper.

00:52:58.540 --> 00:53:04.460
I think it's -- there's just too much red
tape and I would never.

00:53:04.460 --> 00:53:10.920
That's probably the main reason why.
So, and you know, I think they don't really

00:53:10.920 --> 00:53:16.030
want New York chefs coming to San Francisco.
They're very territorial.

00:53:16.030 --> 00:53:17.280
Q [inaudible]

00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:25.590
David Chang: [laughter] Well, I never say
'never', but right now, I don't see any plans.

00:53:25.590 --> 00:53:29.600
But if you ever see me on Dancing with the
Stars, then you'll probably see me in San

00:53:29.600 --> 00:53:32.260
Francisco. [laughter]
Which I hope will never happen.

00:53:32.260 --> 00:53:35.660
&gt;&gt; I think we have time for one more question.

00:53:35.660 --> 00:53:36.800
David Chang: Sure.

00:53:36.800 --> 00:53:42.100
Q Talking about opening new restaurants, and
obviously, the new restaurant coming in Midtown

00:53:42.100 --> 00:53:46.393
soon -- Are you afraid that you're going to
get to the point where you just have the Momofuku

00:53:46.393 --> 00:53:47.393
name attached to something without really
being able to get as involved?

00:53:47.393 --> 00:53:51.210
Is that something that concerns you?
Is it more of a collective more than just

00:53:51.210 --> 00:53:57.080
about you, or?
You know how do you see all that?

00:53:57.080 --> 00:54:04.770
David Chang: It is something that I -- well,
the question is like, how do I deal with the

00:54:04.770 --> 00:54:08.070
Momofuku brand as we grow and my involvement
with it.

00:54:08.070 --> 00:54:13.280
And a lot of it is collective, you know.
We're making people owners, and I want my

00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:19.200
involvement to be less and less.
And, as we grow, I can't be at every restaurant

00:54:19.200 --> 00:54:23.320
cooking behind every stove.
And you know, Marco Pierre White said it best.

00:54:23.320 --> 00:54:28.710
That's why he called bullshit on it all.
He's like, "I'm not."

00:54:28.710 --> 00:54:35.340
He would rather quit as a chef and just be
a restaurant owner, than say he's a chef at

00:54:35.340 --> 00:54:39.350
like, five restaurants.
And that's why at Midtown, I'm not saying

00:54:39.350 --> 00:54:43.760
I'm the chef there. I'm not.
Tien Ho is exactly the chef there. I'm just

00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:47.021
his friend helping out.
You know Tien should have had a restaurant

00:54:47.021 --> 00:54:50.690
a few years ago.
Now, he has his opportunity and he's got a

00:54:50.690 --> 00:54:54.380
real deal and he's going to be the chef owner
there, so.

00:54:54.380 --> 00:54:59.650
That's how we're going to, I think, approach
the future as a group.

00:54:59.650 --> 00:55:03.430
It's not a singular effort, and it's only
going to make our group stronger I think,

00:55:03.430 --> 00:55:06.780
so.
Thank you very much guys.

00:55:06.780 --> 00:55:07.040
