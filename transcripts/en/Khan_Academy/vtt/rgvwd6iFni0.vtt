00:00:00.504 --> 00:00:01.850
- [Voiceover] In the diagram at left,

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:03.824
I drew it up here above,
or I pasted up here,

00:00:03.824 --> 00:00:08.167
line segment A D intersects B E,

00:00:08.167 --> 00:00:11.522
and line segment A B, A B

00:00:11.522 --> 00:00:14.610
is parallel to D E.

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.743
What is the length of side C E?

00:00:17.743 --> 00:00:20.499
So we wanna figure out the length of side,

00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:23.297
we wanna figure out
the length of side C E.

00:00:23.297 --> 00:00:24.458
Now, it might jump out at you,

00:00:24.458 --> 00:00:26.003
at least it looks like it immediately,

00:00:26.003 --> 00:00:28.254
that triangle, the small
triangle on the left

00:00:28.254 --> 00:00:31.911
is going to be similar to this
larger triangle on the right.

00:00:31.911 --> 00:00:33.792
But let's feel good about that.

00:00:33.792 --> 00:00:35.929
Let's prove that to ourselves.

00:00:35.929 --> 00:00:37.915
And to help ourselves prove that,

00:00:37.915 --> 00:00:42.350
we're gonna remind ourselves
that A B is parallel to D E.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.531
And actually, to think
about that even more,

00:00:44.531 --> 00:00:48.851
I'm gonna extend these
segments a little bit,

00:00:48.851 --> 00:00:51.048
so that you can really start to see

00:00:51.048 --> 00:00:52.754
that they are parallel lines,

00:00:52.754 --> 00:00:55.031
and that we have a transversal,

00:00:55.031 --> 00:00:56.504
or we have two transversals

00:00:56.504 --> 00:00:59.093
that intersect those parallel lines.

00:00:59.093 --> 00:01:01.055
All right, and I could keep,

00:01:01.055 --> 00:01:02.785
if I wanted to extend this as a line,

00:01:02.785 --> 00:01:06.291
I could keep going in both directions,

00:01:06.291 --> 00:01:07.428
but the bottom line,

00:01:07.428 --> 00:01:09.193
not to be punny about it,

00:01:09.193 --> 00:01:10.644
is that these two things are parallel.

00:01:10.644 --> 00:01:12.652
That is parallel to that.

00:01:12.652 --> 00:01:14.672
And that's going to help us establish

00:01:14.672 --> 00:01:17.725
that these two triangles are,

00:01:17.725 --> 00:01:20.710
that these two triangles are similar.

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.223
Well, the first thing we know is,

00:01:22.223 --> 00:01:24.192
look, this angle is vertical,

00:01:24.192 --> 00:01:26.077
is a vertical angle with this angle,

00:01:26.077 --> 00:01:28.352
so they're going to be congruent.

00:01:28.352 --> 00:01:30.082
This angle right over here,

00:01:30.082 --> 00:01:33.599
if you view segment B E as a transversal

00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:35.375
of the two parallel lines,

00:01:35.375 --> 00:01:38.092
that right over there is going to be

00:01:38.092 --> 00:01:40.878
an alternate interior angle.

00:01:40.878 --> 00:01:43.478
This is going to be an
alternate interior angle

00:01:43.478 --> 00:01:46.276
to this angle right over here.

00:01:46.276 --> 00:01:49.759
These are alternate interior,
alternate interior angles,

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:50.978
so they're going to be congruent.

00:01:50.978 --> 00:01:52.650
If some of this sounds like Greek to you,

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:53.939
and you are not Greek,

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.597
I encourage you to watch
the videos on Khan Academy

00:01:56.597 --> 00:01:59.837
of angles, of transversals,
and parallel lines.

00:02:00.867 --> 00:02:02.769
And by the same argument,

00:02:02.769 --> 00:02:06.206
if we look at A D as a transversal,

00:02:06.206 --> 00:02:07.098
this angle right over,

00:02:07.098 --> 00:02:09.558
well let me do that in a different color,

00:02:09.558 --> 00:02:13.228
this angle, this angle right over here

00:02:13.228 --> 00:02:15.723
is an alternate interior
angle with this one,

00:02:15.723 --> 00:02:17.488
so they're going to be congruent.

00:02:17.488 --> 00:02:19.403
But the whole point of
everything I just did

00:02:19.403 --> 00:02:21.667
is to show that, look,
the three angles here

00:02:21.667 --> 00:02:23.339
are congruent to the three angles here,

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:25.776
so these must be similar triangles.

00:02:25.776 --> 00:02:27.703
And the reason why that's useful

00:02:27.703 --> 00:02:29.956
is because if the two
triangles are similar,

00:02:29.956 --> 00:02:32.417
then the ratio between corresponding sides

00:02:32.417 --> 00:02:34.937
is going to be the same.

00:02:34.937 --> 00:02:38.163
So, for example, the ratio of side C E,

00:02:38.163 --> 00:02:40.102
so we could say the ratio,

00:02:40.102 --> 00:02:42.714
the ratio of C E,

00:02:42.714 --> 00:02:45.118
of the length of segment C E,

00:02:45.118 --> 00:02:49.052
to say, to say, this side right over here,

00:02:49.982 --> 00:02:52.779
so side, segment E D,

00:02:52.779 --> 00:02:55.623
which has length 7.5,

00:02:55.623 --> 00:02:57.259
is going to be equal to the ratio

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:58.659
of the corresponding side to C.

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:02.454
Look, C E is the side
opposite this green angle,

00:03:02.454 --> 00:03:03.790
so if you go on this similar triangle,

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.717
opposite to this green angle,

00:03:05.717 --> 00:03:07.794
that segment B C.

00:03:07.794 --> 00:03:09.351
So it's going to be equal to the ratio

00:03:09.351 --> 00:03:12.229
of the corresponding side, so 2.1,

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:13.948
in the other triangle,

00:03:13.948 --> 00:03:15.499
to the corresponding side

00:03:15.499 --> 00:03:19.129
of D E in the other triangle.

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:22.427
And this side is opposite this blue angle,

00:03:22.427 --> 00:03:26.242
this, one of the vertical
angles right over here.

00:03:27.442 --> 00:03:28.984
So the corresponding side over here

00:03:28.984 --> 00:03:32.119
is going to be side B A.

00:03:32.119 --> 00:03:36.020
So this is gonna be over 2.5.

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:38.979
So what would C E be equal to?

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:40.443
Well multiple ways to solve this,

00:03:40.443 --> 00:03:44.877
but one way, we could just
multiply both sides by 7.5,

00:03:44.877 --> 00:03:47.884
multiply both sides by 7.5.

00:03:47.884 --> 00:03:51.285
Now, what's 7.5 divided by 2.5?

00:03:51.285 --> 00:03:53.826
Well 75 divided by 25 would be three,

00:03:53.826 --> 00:03:57.271
so 7.5 divided by 2.5 is three.

00:03:58.271 --> 00:03:59.678
So it's going to be three,

00:03:59.678 --> 00:04:04.580
so length of segment C
E is 2.1 times three.

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.870
So the length of segment
C E is going to be,

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:08.342
what is that?

00:04:08.342 --> 00:04:10.746
6.3.

00:04:10.746 --> 00:04:12.324
And if we look down here,

00:04:12.324 --> 00:04:14.402
we see that that is indeed,

00:04:14.402 --> 00:04:17.264
that is indeed on of the choices.
