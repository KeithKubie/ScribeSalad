00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.100
Where we left off in the last
video, Toussaint L'Ouverture

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:09.250
had just been betrayed, on some
level, first by some of

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:13.310
his right-hand men, because
they joined the side of

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:16.020
Leclerc-- or essentially they
gave up rebelling against

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.750
Leclerc-- convinced that Leclerc
wasn't that bad, that

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.850
he had no intention of
reinstating slavery or taking

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:26.100
away the civil rights of the
freemen of African descent.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.960
This is another picture of
Leclerc, right here.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.820
This is Leclerc.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.410
So he had to essentially give
up his arms. He went to

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.590
negotiate with Leclerc, Leclerc
imprisoned him, put

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.150
him on a boat, and sent him to
France and he died the next

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:42.120
year in 1803.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.370
So he was betrayed.

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.570
And he really was, on a lot
of levels, one of the most

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.400
important leaders not
just in Haitian

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.500
history, but in general.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.990
When he took power, as I said
before, he didn't take revenge

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:02.390
on the white population.

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:07.840
He helped the economy of Haiti
get back up and running.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.630
He actually helped defend
what is now Haiti, but

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.550
Saint-Domingue against the
British Royal Navy.

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:18.400
I forgot to mention that.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:28.300
Defended against the British
Navy, which at the time was by

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.850
far the dominant navy
in the world.

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.960
So this is what really earned
his reputation as a great

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.620
general, on top of being a great
leader in terms of not

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.620
exacting revenge, in terms of
not having slash and burn

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.430
tactics, in terms of not just
ravaging his enemies.

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.580
So he was betrayed, and then
just to make it clear that

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:54.620
Leclerc really does deserve
devil horns of a sort--

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.340
although we're about to meet
someone who deserves much

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.880
bigger devil horns, or maybe
that he was actually the

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.400
henchman for someone who
deserves devil horns-- in May

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:14.470
of 1802, Napoleon signs a law
that reinstates slavery where

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:15.720
it has not disappeared.

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.720
And so it was a little
bit ambiguous.

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.860
There were some areas where
slavery had still not

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.250
disappeared.

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:39.430
Those include the French
colonies at Martinique, at

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.620
Saint Lucia, at Tobago.

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.090
But in Haiti-- or
Saint-Domingue, at that time--

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:48.680
things were a little
ambiguous.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.600
Had slavery truly disappeared,
or had it not disappeared yet?

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.440
Apparently, slaves were
free in Haiti.

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.660
So it wasn't clear exactly what
this meant for Haiti, but

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.180
at the same time, the
Haitians didn't even

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.020
know this was happening.

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.750
This was May of 1802.

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:09.500
But just to make things clear,
Napoleon actually sent Leclerc

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.630
a secret memo to essentially
reinstate slavery when the

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:14.880
time was right.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.540
So these guys, they
were no jokers.

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.020
They knew the situation.

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:35.260
They knew that they needed the
help of some of Toussaint

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.570
L'Ouverture's former generals,
former right-hand men, in

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.860
order to keep control
of Haiti.

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.670
But the intention the entire
time was, when they have the

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.090
upper hand, to actually clamp
down, reinstate slavery, and

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.350
take away the civil rights
of the freemen of color.

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.000
Now these guys weren't
stupid either.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.450
So you might remember
Dessalines.

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.560
This was one picture of him.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.560
He was also a former slave, one
of Toussaint L'Ouverture's

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.560
right-hand men, very
effective general.

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.840
And, as you remember, near the
end of the fight against

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.850
Leclerc, he gave up the fight
against Leclerc and to some

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:18.410
degree you could say he turned
on Toussaint L'Ouverture.

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:22.140
But he and some of the other
former followers of

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.170
L'Ouverture saw the writing
on the wall.

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:26.320
They didn't even have to
intercept that secret memo.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:31.750
They got word from Martinique
and Tobago and Saint Lucia

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.120
that slavery was being
reinstated.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.030
The French at this time were not
people that you wanted to

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:42.360
deal with or trust when it came
to issues of slavery.

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:50.720
So Dessalines and his comrades
re-took up arms. And

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.210
Dessalines was a very different
character than

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.080
Toussaint L'Ouverture.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.760
The one similarity is that they
were both very effective

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.220
military men.

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:05.390
The big difference between the
two was that Dessalines was

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:06.900
not one to hold back.

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:17.665
He wasn't afraid to essentially
take an eye for an

00:05:17.665 --> 00:05:18.660
eye, so to speak.

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:22.670
So here you had Dessalines in
charge of what was, I guess

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:25.200
you could call, the
slave rebel army.

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.800
And then on the other side of
it, you have Leclerc with the

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:33.540
40,000 troops that he showed
up, with Napoleon.

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:37.830
But lucky for Dessalines,
yellow fever--

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:38.660
and it's not lucky.

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:40.910
I mean, people died
across the board.

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:46.900
But this did really turn the
tide of war in favor of the

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.370
people of African descent
on the island.

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:58.595
Yellow fever struck the island,
it killed Leclerc, and

00:05:58.595 --> 00:06:02.000
it also took out twenty
something thousand-- or the

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.670
number I read was 24,000-- of
the actual French soldiers,

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:08.430
and another 8,000 were
hospitalized.

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:11.270
So that's 32,000 out of
commission, so you're

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:15.485
essentially only left
with 8,000 soldiers.

00:06:15.485 --> 00:06:17.910
So all of a sudden, it
completely turned the tide,

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:22.530
completely changed the numbers
in terms of what types of

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:27.370
forces the rebel army had
to fight against.

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:32.030
But it wasn't all good at this
point because Leclerc-- I

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:35.110
mentioned, I gave him little
devil horns-- he was replaced

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:41.440
by someone who deserves very
big devil horns named

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:42.690
Rochambeau.

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:48.770
Not to be confused with his
father, who goes by the same

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:52.380
name who was a hero of the
American Revolution.

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:56.810
He fought for France on the
side of the Americans.

00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:00.040
And he, as far as I can tell,
seemed like a decent guy.

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:03.570
But his son was really evil.

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:06.690
And there are very few people
in history that you can say

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:08.990
are unambiguously evil.

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:10.700
He is one of them.

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:15.090
Now that he was kind of
desperate, his forces were

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:19.120
ravaged by yellow fever, he's
going against a fairly

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:25.990
aggressive enemy, he did things
like-- let me write

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:28.180
these down because
they are evil.

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:33.035
He would bury African--
or I guess I

00:07:33.035 --> 00:07:34.070
should say African Americans.

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:37.605
He would bury former slaves, or
people of African descent--

00:07:37.605 --> 00:07:44.985
bury in, bury alive in
pits of insects.

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:50.440
He would boil people
alive in molasses.

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:01.650
I read one account that says
that at one point he held a

00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:07.670
ball where he invited all of
the prominent mixed-race

00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:11.630
people to a party essentially at
his place and at the stroke

00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:12.920
of midnight he announced
that all of the

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:14.170
men are to be murdered.

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:22.710
The only bounds on his cruelty
was the people that he could

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:26.000
get his hands on, especially the
people of African descent.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.480
The one positive of his cruelty
is that he for the

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:36.549
first time really unified the
population of African descent

00:08:36.549 --> 00:08:37.419
on the island.

00:08:37.419 --> 00:08:49.280
So he unified both the slaves,
the former slaves, and the

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:50.530
mixed-race.

00:08:56.530 --> 00:09:03.160
And at the same time,
we're now in 1803.

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:05.090
And, I've said it before, we're

00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:06.340
still at war with Britain.

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:14.500
And Britain is-- and I've
mentioned it before-- they had

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:17.000
the most dominant navy
in the world.

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:30.200
This guy, despite how evil and
how cruel he was, he needed

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:33.210
reinforcements from Napoleon
if he had to take on

00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:34.360
Dessalines.

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:37.390
And let me be very
clear about this.

00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:40.800
Dessalines, as I mentioned, he
was not hesitant to take an

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:42.150
eye for an eye.

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:47.670
In one incident, Rochambeau
buried 500 rebel prisoners

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:52.790
alive, then Dessalines went and
hung 500 French prisoners.

00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:55.600
So he wasn't someone
to kind of shy away

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:58.540
from, I guess, blood.

00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:01.610
And this is very different
to Toussaint L'Ouverture.

00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:02.470
It's kind of a lesson.

00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:05.980
If you are fighting an enemy,
if you get rid of the more

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:13.850
reasonable leaders of your
enemy, you might end up

00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:18.050
getting maybe a leader more
similar to yourself and your

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:22.620
cruelty, if you betrayed the
more reasonable ones.

00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:25.330
But anyway, enough
of my commentary.

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:27.470
So the stage is set.

00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:28.340
War with Britain.

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:31.940
Britain owns the seas,
especially the Caribbean.

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:37.900
This guy needs reinforcements
going against a very strong

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:42.160
leader of the former
slave rebels.

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:45.890
But Napoleon, he's known to
be one to cut his losses.

00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:47.380
He did it with his
troops in Egypt.

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:49.970
He's really not someone who
really cares, I think, about

00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:50.495
the individual.

00:10:50.495 --> 00:10:54.280
He cares much more about
his ego and his power.

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:55.910
So Napoleon leaves
them hanging.

00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:03.800
Napoleon saw the writing
on the wall.

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:06.655
He wouldn't be able to get
through the British fleet.

00:11:06.655 --> 00:11:08.460
And at the same time, Napoleon's
fighting all of

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:09.550
these wars in Europe.

00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:11.720
As you remember, the whole
French Revolution was

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:14.090
precipitated by France
being broke.

00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:17.010
So Napoleon, not only does he
give up on this guy-- and he

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:19.400
essentially got what he
deserved-- Napoleon gives up

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:23.910
on maintaining all of their
colonies or any major presence

00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:25.150
in the Western Hemisphere.

00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:30.320
So essentially to raise funds,
Napoleon also sells Louisiana

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:31.346
to the Americans.

00:11:31.346 --> 00:11:34.300
Now when I say Louisiana, I'm
not talking about just the

00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:36.930
state of Louisiana in its
present state, which

00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:37.900
is about that big.

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:39.800
That's actually where
I was born.

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:42.080
We're talking about the whole--
this is like 1/3 of

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:44.180
the United States today.

00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:45.580
Sold all of this.

00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:51.780
And he was clearly desperate.

00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:56.330
He sold it for $15 million,
or that's the

00:11:56.330 --> 00:12:03.350
equivalent of F60 million.

00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:06.220
And I've been told, in today's
money, that would be on the

00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:10.480
order of $10 billion.

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:13.720
You know, if someone said for
$10 billion, you could own 1/3

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:15.470
of the land of the United
States, you would say that's a

00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:16.850
pretty good deal.

00:12:16.850 --> 00:12:19.100
$10 billion in today's money.

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:23.120
So $15 million 1803, $10 billion
today, that's still

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:24.730
not a lot of money, but
he was desperate.

00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:27.660
He realized that he couldn't
maintain control of something

00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:30.920
halfway around the world when
Britain owned the seas and he

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:34.300
was busy having his own
troubles in Europe.

00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:36.410
So the Americans got
a good deal.

00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:38.580
And frankly, if he didn't sell
it to the Americans, either

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:40.860
the British or the Americans
could have probably

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:43.890
just taken it anyway.

00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:48.510
So being left to hang to dry
by Napoleon, Dessalines is

00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:55.230
able to destroy Rochambeau
and essentially declare

00:12:55.230 --> 00:13:00.410
independence for
Saint-Domingue.

00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:09.250
And it 1804, January 1.

00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:13.830
Dessalines declares independence
for, and he names

00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:17.560
the new country Haiti, which
is the indigenous peoples'

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:18.640
name for the island.

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:21.010
It means land of
the mountains.

00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:26.380
Now I want to just leave with
one note, because you may or

00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:27.100
may not be aware.

00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:32.030
Haiti is still a very, very,
very, very poor country.

00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:35.230
And besides, after Dessalines,
they had many, many, many--

00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:38.620
and eventually, I'll do videos
on it-- rounds of one dictator

00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:39.280
after another.

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:41.120
And the people have really
been through a lot.

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:42.880
But I just want to make it clear
that they really got

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:45.330
started off on a
horrible foot.

00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:51.660
Because even though Dessalines
declared independence in 1804,

00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:55.230
the French did not recognize
Haiti until

00:13:55.230 --> 00:14:04.730
1805-- sorry- 1825.

00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:08.490
And you might say, well, who
cares about recognition?

00:14:08.490 --> 00:14:11.180
Who cares what the former
colonial masters think?

00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:12.890
But until they recognized them,
they were essentially

00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:14.050
embargoing Haiti.

00:14:14.050 --> 00:14:16.000
They weren't allowing
any trade to

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.740
actually go on with Haiti.

00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:20.130
So it was really on the
front of a barrel gun.

00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:27.030
And in order to be recognized,
Haiti had to agree to F90

00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:33.710
million of debt to France.

00:14:39.290 --> 00:14:42.680
And just to be clear how much
money this is, here's a small

00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:50.440
island-- or half of an island--
of newly freed slaves

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:55.330
and they were forced to owe
France-- and this actually was

00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:58.850
further reinforced
by the United

00:14:58.850 --> 00:15:00.140
States and Great Britain.

00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:03.460
So it goes to show you, even
former enemies can kind of

00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:06.210
agree when it comes to
a oppressing small

00:15:06.210 --> 00:15:08.100
impoverished islands.

00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:14.090
But they had to owe France the
equivalent of 1 and 1/2 times

00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:18.240
what the United States paid for
the Louisiana Purchase.

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:19.530
This was F60 million.

00:15:19.530 --> 00:15:20.720
They got all of Louisiana.

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:24.830
Now France is telling Haiti,
you owe us F90 million.

00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:28.470
Or that's roughly the equivalent
of $14 or $15

00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:33.580
billion in today's terms. And
this is for a population of

00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:36.230
essentially half a million
freed slaves.

00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:37.970
So it's kind of a horrendous
amount of debt.

00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:41.290
And just to be clear, this
wasn't like the crazy

00:15:41.290 --> 00:15:46.150
colonials in the early 19th
century, forcing to do this.

00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:58.720
This debt was not paid off with
the interest until 1947.

00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:00.480
They were continuing
to pay the debt.

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:05.580
And just to add insult to
injury, the reason for the

00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:09.740
debt, they claim, was
for lost property.

00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:12.420
So that's why France claimed
that Haiti owed them the

00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:13.775
money, for lost property.

00:16:17.690 --> 00:16:20.840
Where, included in the
list of lost property

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:23.300
was land and slaves.

00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:26.860
Essentially, now that you've got
your freedom, you owe us a

00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:31.480
ton of money for us losing
the rights to own you.

00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:32.890
So it's just insult to injury.

00:16:32.890 --> 00:16:34.810
And actually, I was shocked the
first time I learned this

00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:38.310
number, that they were forced to
continue to pay debts from

00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:43.360
one poor country, one small poor
country, right over here,

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:46.830
they had to continue to pay
debts to a Western developed

00:16:46.830 --> 00:16:53.200
nation until 1947, essentially
to buy their freedom.
