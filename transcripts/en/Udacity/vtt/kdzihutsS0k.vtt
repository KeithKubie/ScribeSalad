Now, we can't forget about Grant's
gleaming glasses. So, let's see how the

00:00:04.307 --> 00:00:09.065
vocabulary we've discussed pops up in the
math we've done for him so far. Now, let's

00:00:09.065 --> 00:00:12.625
see, what was that last equation that we
wrote for the amount of money that he has

00:00:12.625 --> 00:00:21.401
left? That's right. We had y = 3,000,000 -
100,000x. Remember, y here stands for the

00:00:21.413 --> 00:00:26.323
amount of money that Grant has left and x
over here stands for the number of months

00:00:26.323 --> 00:00:30.962
that have gone by since Grant started his
business. So you have 3 terms in this

00:00:30.962 --> 00:00:37.397
equation. We have y, 3,000,000, and
-100,000x. Which of these terms are

00:00:37.397 --> 00:00:41.699
variable terms and which of them are
constant terms? Please fill in the proper

00:00:41.711 --> 00:00:43.792
bubbles below each term.
