00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:04.010
FELIPE HOFFA: Let's talk
about data-- big data.

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:06.220
Have you ever run
an SQL query that

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:08.630
has taken 10 minutes to run?

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:09.380
An hour?

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:10.650
10 days?

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.910
How much time have you spent
determining the right indexes

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:15.400
and building them?

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.790
How much space will they
take up in your database?

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:21.220
Or maybe you've already
discovered the power

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:22.200
of [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.950
Are you impressed
by how [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.070
can solve the same
problems in an hour or two?

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.950
If so, how did you choose what
kind of network, amount of RAM,

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:33.320
and CPU cores were involved?

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.600
Perhaps you've
dreamed about taking

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.180
all your Google Analytics
data and joining it

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.080
with all the data in
your CRM database.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.780
But how long would that take?

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.240
What if I told
you that you could

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.250
run all these queries
in seconds, not hours,

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.740
without worrying about
any of these problems?

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.255
No indexes, no virtual machines,
just your data, Google,

00:00:54.255 --> 00:00:56.040
and you.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.350
I'm Felipe Hoffa from the
Google Developer Relations team.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.156
And today, we're going to
talk about Google BigQuery.

00:01:02.156 --> 00:01:04.950
BigQuery is a cloud
database run by Google.

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:08.290
It's capable of analyzing
terabytes of data in seconds.

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.730
And to start, you
only need to know SQL.

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:13.680
If you know how to
write SQL queries,

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.520
you already know
how to query it.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.025
In fact, there are plenty
of interesting public data

00:01:19.025 --> 00:01:22.105
sets shared in BigQuery,
ready to be queried by you.

00:01:22.105 --> 00:01:23.910
You'll get a free
monthly [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:28.050
to do so, so why
not start right now?

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:29.740
If you are ready
to get started, it

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.860
doesn't get any
simpler than this.

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.940
With most other
databases, you first

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.370
need to answer many
implementation questions

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.880
before getting to the
two essential ones.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.085
What's my data?

00:01:40.085 --> 00:01:42.680
And what questions do
I want to ask from it?

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.290
With BigQuery, basic
pricing depends only

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.190
on those two questions.

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.510
BigQuery will charge
you for data storage

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:53.092
and for the amount of
data each query possesses.

00:01:53.092 --> 00:01:54.960
That's it.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.600
So BigQuery is a database
in the Cloud by Google,

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.640
SQL compatible, and focuses the
essentials of data analysis.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.040
And most importantly,
it analyzes data really,

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.080
really fast.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.206
This is an SQL query.

00:02:10.206 --> 00:02:13.080
It's simple, but
it's doing a lot.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.680
It's running a
regular expression.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.290
It's aggregating data.

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.020
It's sorting the results.

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.940
And this particular
one will be processing

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.520
230 gigabytes of data
over a billion rows.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.500
Don't try this at home.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.850
Your database might
not like that.

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:35.990
But in BigQuery, it will only
take-- it's already done.

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.140
Now, it's your turn
to give it a try.

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.480
If you already have lots of
data to analyze and understand,

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.120
you'll love being
able to analyze it

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.840
faster than ever before.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.840
Individuals and companies
around the world

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.560
are using BigQuery to understand
their [INAUDIBLE] behavior

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.420
or to [INAUDIBLE]
their logs [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.850
and improve the performance
of their systems,

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.020
or to maximize their profit,
finding relationships

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:58.920
previously invisible.

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.980
You can also use
BigQuery to analyze

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.180
any of the very large public
data sets already available

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.950
in it.

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.250
You may be about to
discover that BigQuery

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.440
is one of the best
places to share data

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.130
and let other people
instantly analyze it.

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.650
And of course, you
always have full control

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.840
over who can access your data.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.250
We publish plenty of
videos and case studies

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.450
highlighting these stories.

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:23.920
Check them out.

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.910
Getting started is simple, as
BigQuery has an easy-to-use web

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:27.800
UI.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.750
You can also connect it to your
favorite programming framework

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.430
and analysis tools
thanks to its REST API.

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.300
There's a big
ecosystem of products

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.800
that [INAUDIBLE] BigQuery
to store and analyze

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.070
their big data.

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:42.450
You can easily connect it
to other Google products,

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.570
like [INAUDIBLE]
and Apps Script,

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:47.970
or access data from Google
Analytics [INAUDIBLE],

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.140
to name a few.

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.670
The open source community has
also embraced BigQuery with

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:57.060
connectors to [INAUDIBLE] for
powerful analysis or the log

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.120
collector [INAUDIBLE], to send
all your logs to be queried

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.160
to analyse.

So what do you want to do next?

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.670
Do you want to know how
BigQuery works internally

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.340
or how to query one of
the many public data sets?

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.140
Or are you ready to
upload your own data

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:19.690
