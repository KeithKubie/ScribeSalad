00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Well, let's take a look at this triangle a little more closely. Let's find FRY first.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
This is the opposite side of this angle and we already know the hypotenuse.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
It's 100 N. What trade function that opposite the hypotenuse, the sine.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.000
So if I solve this for FRY, plug in my 100 N and my 30Â°, I get an answer of 50 N

00:00:19.000 --> 99:59:59.000
I can use similar reasoning to find FRX. This time it's the cosine and this gives me a value of 86.6 N.
