00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.950
I mentioned the idea of doing
mathematical morphology.

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:05.460
That is, fixing up your picture.

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:06.300
Okay?

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:10.200
And, fundamentally,
there are two basic operations, and

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.380
they're referred to as dilation and
erosion.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.660
We're going to go through
both of those in detail.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.848
Once you have those
two basic operations,

00:00:16.848 --> 00:00:19.292
you can combine those to
make more operations.

00:00:19.292 --> 00:00:21.069
Eh, there are a whole bunch of them, and

00:00:21.069 --> 00:00:24.167
this used to be a whole industry
doing mathematical morphology.

00:00:24.167 --> 00:00:26.957
The ones that we use most to date,
or I should say,

00:00:26.957 --> 00:00:31.024
the ones that we use most currently, are
various forms of closing and opening,

00:00:31.024 --> 00:00:33.200
and we're going to talk about those.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.690
Then there's thinning and
thickening, and a few other things,

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.060
but they all stem from these two basic
operations of dilation and erosion.

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:41.690
So let's go through those.

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.170
So dilation is exactly what
it sounds like, right,

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.650
when you dilate something it expands.

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:53.860
And so dilation, expands the connected
set of ones in the binary image.

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.230
So, here you see this thing expand,
if you get bigger, and really,

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.240
you know, just grew out, and

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:03.210
were going to talk about the mechanisms
by which you do dilation, and

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.410
something called the structuring
elements which control the shape.

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:08.400
This one is an interesting one, right?

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.960
Everything expanded and
has two effects, first of all,

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.062
things got a little straighter.

00:01:14.062 --> 00:01:20.020
But also, notice that these
little cutouts went away.

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.740
Likewise, when this thing got bigger,
okay, the holes went away.

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.070
Dilation in general can be used for,
like it says, filling holes and gaps.

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.280
The, inverse, converse, reverse?

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.125
The other,
of dilation is called erosion, okay?

00:01:36.125 --> 00:01:38.450
Erosion, just like when beaches and
other things erode,

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.710
is you're essentially
shrinking the shape.

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.329
Right?
So this big bar becomes a narrower bar,

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:45.833
this big circle becomes
a smaller circle.

00:01:45.833 --> 00:01:48.010
Here's where you start to see its power,
right?

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.580
These two connected, sort of
elliptical things become, like here,

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.070
it's this case, it's these two circular
things, you, you, could actually do it,

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.070
go from those ellipses and circles.

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.500
The important thing is that
middle part went away.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.290
And here you see that these little
protuberances went away when the entire

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.860
thing shrank, and
that's referred to as erosion, okay.
