Speaker 1:          00:00          I mean when I laughed so hard when a guy goes, my balls got hot and you go, there was the best company. The best thing you could have possibly said was, I understand. Love that guy. Oh Man. Louis is, he's a, he's a genius. He figured out a way to be himself. He forgot his Instagram page. No, no. If there's anything fucking crazy going on in the world. Derek Lewis has it on his Instagram page is Instagram page is the best people found out about it. I gave him a shout out to his Instagram page on one of the UFC broadcasts and now it's got like, what does he have? How many falls do you have now? 1.6 million. 1.6 million. It's not good though. It's fucking chaos. He always gets videos deleted and removed, but apparently they leave him up there. I mean, they're not threatening to take them down, I don't think.

Speaker 1:          00:45          I hope not every, it's where I go to any fucking dummy that's trying to like, like light a bomb under a tire and fly through the air and smash the roof of a fucking garage with his face. He's got all that shit. Motorcycle accidents or people trying to do wheelies and they fall. It lands on them. Anything fucked up on the Internet, dairy know. It's funny he's got it all. Anything crazy fucking, he's a hilarious guy. But the fact that he could say something like that, you know, like right after a fight, why is taking shape? So Paul's was hot.

Speaker 1:          01:20          He starts selling tee shirts afterwards. My balls aside tee shirt so they don't, I got one. I don't think people listen to anything that's being said about the, let's say I need one. Derek, please. I need one of those shirts I need. I need one of those shirts please. Derek. Oh my God. He's the best. He such a character. Fight his ass off too. So do what the, I know it's your show, but uh, what, how many fights do you do now? And does anybody care about a fight? You don't announce childhood for sure. Care. Yeah. I do a 10 a year, 10 or year events a year. I'm doing like a big paper views, like 10. There's a lot of them that are overseas. I just want you to be the voice right time. I just don't have the time. I don't have the time with all the podcasts with doing stand up and, you know, making Netflix specials and shit just don't time.

Speaker 1:          02:22          Right. We have, fuck now I know there's not like it better when I do it once a month, like once, like 10 times a year is basically once a month or I liked, I liked that better because it seems like that's, um, and it's the higher profile stuff. I don't mind the aisle. There's a lot of fights that are not that high profile that I lost. Like their Crosby, stills and Nash and you're young, right? You just pop in and do the big shows. And that's funny. People, you know, you don't care as much. I love it, man. I love doing it. I still do. But, um.
