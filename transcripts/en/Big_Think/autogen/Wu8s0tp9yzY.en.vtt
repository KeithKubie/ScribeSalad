how is it able to do this because if a

how is it able to do this because if a
 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:24.319
how is it able to do this because if a
pollinator is fooled then that plant is

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329
pollinator is fooled then that plant is
 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:27.050
pollinator is fooled then that plant is
rewarded so the plant is actually using

I can't find anything that's missing

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049
I can't find anything that's missing
 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:24.430
I can't find anything that's missing
from the equation so we have

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440
from the equation so we have
 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.770
from the equation so we have
self-modifying code

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780
self-modifying code
 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.300
self-modifying code
you have Bitcoin so you could have a

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310
you have Bitcoin so you could have a
 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.170
you have Bitcoin so you could have a
reward structure with blockchain and

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180
reward structure with blockchain and
 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.879
reward structure with blockchain and
there's nothing that I see that keeps us

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:34.889
there's nothing that I see that keeps us
 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:37.779
there's nothing that I see that keeps us
from creating now that is such a such a

00:04:37.779 --> 00:04:37.789
from creating now that is such a such a
 

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:41.390
from creating now that is such a such a
strange and quixotic possibility now in

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400
strange and quixotic possibility now in
 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.650
strange and quixotic possibility now in
this framework I don't see an

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660
this framework I don't see an
 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.719
this framework I don't see an
existential risk so that my friend to

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:44.729
existential risk so that my friend to
 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:48.140
existential risk so that my friend to
worry about machine intelligence being a

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150
worry about machine intelligence being a
 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.270
worry about machine intelligence being a
terminal invention for the human species

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280
terminal invention for the human species
 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.550
terminal invention for the human species
probably don't need to be worried but I

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560
probably don't need to be worried but I
 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.140
probably don't need to be worried but I
think that there's a lot of exotica

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150
think that there's a lot of exotica
 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.689
think that there's a lot of exotica
around artificial intelligence which

00:04:56.689 --> 00:04:56.699
around artificial intelligence which
 

00:04:56.699 --> 00:04:58.969
around artificial intelligence which
hasn't been explored and I think which

00:04:58.969 --> 00:04:58.979
hasn't been explored and I think which
 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:01.999
hasn't been explored and I think which
is much closer to fruition perhaps

00:05:01.999 --> 00:05:02.009
is much closer to fruition perhaps
 

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:04.850
is much closer to fruition perhaps
that's good maybe it's a warning shot so

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860
that's good maybe it's a warning shot so
 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.529
that's good maybe it's a warning shot so
that we're going to find that we just as

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:06.539
that we're going to find that we just as
 

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:09.350
that we're going to find that we just as
we woke up to Bitcoin is digital gold we

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360
we woke up to Bitcoin is digital gold we
 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.170
we woke up to Bitcoin is digital gold we
may wake up to a precursor to artificial

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180
may wake up to a precursor to artificial
 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.710
may wake up to a precursor to artificial
general intelligence which alerts us to

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:15.720
general intelligence which alerts us to
 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:16.999
general intelligence which alerts us to
the fact that we should probably be

00:05:16.999 --> 00:05:17.009
the fact that we should probably be
 

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:19.100
the fact that we should probably be
devoting more energy into this

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.110
devoting more energy into this
 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:22.370
devoting more energy into this
absolutely crazy sounding future problem

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:22.380
absolutely crazy sounding future problem
 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:25.760
absolutely crazy sounding future problem
which no humans have ever encountered

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.770
