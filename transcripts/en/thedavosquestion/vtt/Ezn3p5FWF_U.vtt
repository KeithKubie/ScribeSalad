00:00:01.069 --> 00:00:07.740
I think that this year is a very important
year because the Davos meeting is happening

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:14.829
in not a very conventional way because everybody
astonishes at crisis but also everybody is

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:22.039
trying to think how we can it-this crisis.
And one of the opportunities that's happening

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:30.490
right now is the crisis help us to think and
which are the fastest ways to go in the direction

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:37.809
of a low carbon economy. And I think that
in several speeches here we can see the commitment

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:47.320
of several leaders and-and statesmans towards
the commitment with climate change and action

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.539
in the direction of a new type of a _____
economy.

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:58.519
And the second thing that I think is very
important is rethinking ethic in business.

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:05.449
More and more we have to have transparency,
collaboration and the lessons learned from

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:13.280
the crisis help us to understand that the
real next step after the crisis will be a

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:19.740
much more committed economy to ethics and
values that can support trust.
