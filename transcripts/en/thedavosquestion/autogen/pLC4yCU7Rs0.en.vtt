used in the gene goldrush to identify

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720
used in the gene goldrush to identify
 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.170
used in the gene goldrush to identify
new genetic information and also to make

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180
new genetic information and also to make
 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.720
new genetic information and also to make
use of that genetic information in

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730
use of that genetic information in
 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.410
use of that genetic information in
healthcare for instance but also into
