00:00:07.445 --> 00:00:09.401
Thanks, Eitan.

00:00:09.401 --> 00:00:12.810
Finding high quality users
is the ultimate challenge

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:14.240
that all of you
face, so I'm here

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.980
to talk about how you can
find high quality users.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.110
And specifically,
I wanted to provide

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.130
a lens of how Google thinks
about user acquisition products

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.010
across three specific lenses.

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:25.020
So let's get into it.

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:26.700
Simplicity with automation.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.610
As you know, Google
has a variety

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:30.785
of placements where you
can put ads to find users,

00:00:30.785 --> 00:00:34.030
so whether people are
discovering on Play, searching

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.510
on Google.com, engaging
with apps, surfing the web,

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:39.620
or watching videos on YouTube.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.320
But historically,
what you have to do

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.010
is build a campaign for each
one of these properties.

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.560
Guess what?

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.960
We now have a product that you
can access all that inventory

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.520
in a simple set of three steps.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.640
First just set you target
CPI, location, and budget.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.760
Second, you put an app ID.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.000
It downloads the app
icon and the images.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.775
And third, if you have a
YouTube URL, you put it in,

00:01:02.775 --> 00:01:05.110
and you have videos for
ads displayed across AdMob,

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:05.980
as well as YouTube.

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:09.550
And then you let the Google
machine learning take over.

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:11.500
Just with these
three simple steps,

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.370
you can get access to
all those properties.

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.970
So that's one way that
Google is solving for this.

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.230
Second is quality at scale.

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:22.090
Now, all of you know that
driving installs at scale

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.780
is critical.

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.970
But the new thing
is I want users

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.630
that provide lifetime value.

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.360
And it's basically
like bringing people

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.567
into your store who are
not interested in loss.

00:01:33.567 --> 00:01:35.150
So this is what we
want to improve on.

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.590
So Conversion
Optimizer was a product

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.460
that was primarily used to
optimize installs at scale.

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.340
Now what we're doing is helping
you optimize buyers at scale.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.600
What this means is
now you can get access

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.350
to acquiring users
who have either

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.040
made a purchase on Google
Play or paid for an app

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.930
or have a potential
to spend on an app.

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.580
And with a simple
click of a checkbox,

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.660
you can actually use
Conversion Optimizer

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.430
to find buyers like this
for your specific app.

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.380
And people who actually
did this at a global level

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.490
increased their
chances of finding

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:15.140
a buyer using this campaign 24
times than any other campaign.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.540
So that's the second point
about quality of scale.

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.970
The third that I wanted
to talk about a little bit

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.240
is what only Google offers you.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.350
So the first thing is video.

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.480
As you all know, YouTube is
a great platform for gamers.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.050
So if you're not on
YouTube, please get on it.

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.740
And if you know, avid gamers
are about a third of the gamers.

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.330
And two out of the three avid
gamers visit YouTube daily.

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.500
And of these avid gamers,
almost two-thirds of them

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.270
download a game
once they see an ad.

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.780
So a great platform,
and ever since this

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.170
has been launched
at the end of 2014,

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.430
we've had huge success
for people to find gamers.

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.060
The second thing I'm
very, very excited

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.630
about is this format
called a Trial Run format.

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.350
In this way, prequalified
users who actually

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:03.640
will stay with you again.

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.620
This is an ad format
where you can actually

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.140
try your game in an
ad for 60 seconds

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.950
before you can decide
to download it.

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.420
It prequalifies users
in such a great way,

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.970
so you'll get users that
you actually want and are

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.630
interested in your game.

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:22.290
And the third, we typically
have optimized people who

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:23.630
are interested in app category.

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:24.270
That's one.

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:25.780
That was old news.

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.565
Number two, I shared, you
optimize for people who buy

00:03:28.565 --> 00:03:32.040
or monetize better through
Conversion Optimizer.

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.630
But the third thing that
we want is engaged users.

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:36.590
Now you can actually
target people

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.540
who are active
gamers-- for example,

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.180
people who spend at least 30
minutes in the last 30 days

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.020
on games.

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.230
And again, this is all
achieved with a click

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.200
of a single, simple button.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.899
So I know I rushed through this.

00:03:50.899 --> 00:03:53.440
We're going to talk a lot more
about this in the round table,

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.611
so please make sure you
come and discuss whatever

00:03:56.611 --> 00:03:58.360
you want to do to
leverage these products,

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:59.340
because at the
end of the day, we

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.370
want you guys to make
money out of your games.

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:02.085
Thank you.

00:04:02.085 --> 00:04:03.870
