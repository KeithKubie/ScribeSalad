00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
[Question 1] The correct answer in the first case is 0.8.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
This is just 1 minus 0.2.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.000
If X and Y are independent, then we just take the product of those 2 things, which is 0.04.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
And in the last case, it turns out X and Y are independent but just by a coincidence

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
because the probability of Y is independent of what X says,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and therefore, the outcome is 0.6.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Put differently no what matter value X assumes, whether it's X or not X,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Y is always 0.6 probability so it must be that P(Y) is 0.6.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
You can actually compute this using total probability

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:45.000
where P(Y) equals P(Y|X) times P(X) plus P(Y|¬X) times (P¬X).

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
When you plug in the numbers, you get 0.6 times 0.2 over here;

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
0.6 times 0.8 over here, the complement of 0.2.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And if you regroup this, or you put the 0.2 and the 0.8 together into one,

00:00:58.000 --> 09:59:59.000
you end up with 0.6.
