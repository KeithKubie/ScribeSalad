00:00:00.874 --> 00:00:02.184
I'm Denice Frohman,

00:00:02.184 --> 00:00:05.183
and this is "Accents."

00:00:07.443 --> 00:00:11.899
my mom holds her accent like a shotgun,

00:00:11.899 --> 00:00:14.570
with two good hands.

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:16.300
her tongue, all brass knuckle

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:17.880
slipping in between her lips

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.260
her hips, are all laughter and wind clap.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.850
she speaks a sanchocho 
of spanish and english,

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:26.560
pushing up and against one another,

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:27.550
in rapid fire

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.430
there is no telling my mama to be "quiet,"

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.930
my mama don't know "quiet."

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.500
her voice is one size better fit all

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.570
and you best not tell her to hush,

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.400
she waited too many years for her 
voice to arrive

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.090
to be told it needed house keeping.

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.840
English sits in her mouth remixed

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.820
so "strawberry" becomes "eh-strawbeddy"

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.130
and "cookie" becomes "eh-cookie"

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.850
and kitchen, key chain, and chicken 
all sound the same.

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.720
my mama doesn't say "yes"

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.678
she says, "ah ha"

00:01:00.678 --> 00:01:05.168
and suddenly the sky in her mouth 
becomes a Hector Lavoe song.

00:01:05.171 --> 00:01:08.051
her tongue can't lay itself 
down flat enough

00:01:08.051 --> 00:01:09.891
for the English language,

00:01:09.891 --> 00:01:11.441
it got too much hip

00:01:11.441 --> 00:01:12.641
too much bone

00:01:12.641 --> 00:01:13.901
too much conga

00:01:13.901 --> 00:01:14.731
too much cuatro

00:01:14.731 --> 00:01:15.701
to two step

00:01:15.701 --> 00:01:17.101
got too many piano keys

00:01:17.101 --> 00:01:18.511
in between her teeth,

00:01:18.511 --> 00:01:20.081
it got too much clave

00:01:20.081 --> 00:01:21.571
too much hand clap

00:01:21.571 --> 00:01:23.851
got too much salsa to sit still

00:01:23.851 --> 00:01:26.291
it be an anxious child wanting to

00:01:26.291 --> 00:01:29.291
make Play-Doh out of concrete

00:01:29.291 --> 00:01:30.981
English be too neat for

00:01:30.981 --> 00:01:32.971
her kind of wonderful.

00:01:32.971 --> 00:01:35.031
her words spill in conversation

00:01:35.031 --> 00:01:38.361
between women whose hands are all they got

00:01:38.361 --> 00:01:41.086
sometimes our hands are all we got

00:01:41.086 --> 00:01:43.556
and accents that remind us 
that we are still

00:01:43.556 --> 00:01:45.256
bomba, still plena

00:01:45.256 --> 00:01:47.146
you say "wepa"

00:01:47.146 --> 00:01:49.416
and a stranger becomes your hermano,

00:01:49.416 --> 00:01:51.136
you say "dale"

00:01:51.136 --> 00:01:53.606
and a crowd becomes a family reunion.

00:01:55.832 --> 00:01:59.232
my mother's tongue is a telegram 
from her mother

00:01:59.232 --> 00:02:01.992
decorated with the coqui's of el campo

00:02:01.992 --> 00:02:04.192
so even when her lips can barely

00:02:04.192 --> 00:02:06.342
stretch themselves around english,

00:02:06.342 --> 00:02:08.991
her accent is a stubborn compass

00:02:08.991 --> 00:02:10.491
always pointing her

00:02:10.491 --> 00:02:12.782
towards home.
