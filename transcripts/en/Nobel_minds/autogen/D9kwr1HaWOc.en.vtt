my name is Charlie father and I'm 16 and

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370
my name is Charlie father and I'm 16 and
 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.610
my name is Charlie father and I'm 16 and
I was wondering if the James Webb Space

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620
I was wondering if the James Webb Space
 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:05.960
I was wondering if the James Webb Space
Telescope is going to give us results

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970
Telescope is going to give us results
 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:07.610
Telescope is going to give us results
rapidly or he's going to take a few

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620
rapidly or he's going to take a few
 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.790
rapidly or he's going to take a few
years to give us results okay Charlie

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800
years to give us results okay Charlie
 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.650
years to give us results okay Charlie
you're wondering whether the telescope

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660
you're wondering whether the telescope
 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.270
you're wondering whether the telescope
will give us results right away or will

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280
will give us results right away or will
 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.910
will give us results right away or will
take many years so some of both we

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920
take many years so some of both we
 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.740
take many years so some of both we
anticipate that will point the telescope

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750
anticipate that will point the telescope
 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.540
anticipate that will point the telescope
it's a very beautiful and important

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550
it's a very beautiful and important
 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.490
it's a very beautiful and important
objects right away as soon as we can and

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500
objects right away as soon as we can and
 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.189
objects right away as soon as we can and
within a few months after the telescope

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199
within a few months after the telescope
 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.500
within a few months after the telescope
is ready to observe will be having some

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510
is ready to observe will be having some
 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.750
is ready to observe will be having some
beautiful science to tell you about but

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760
beautiful science to tell you about but
 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.550
beautiful science to tell you about but
some projects just take a long time when

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560
some projects just take a long time when
 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.990
some projects just take a long time when
we want to study the most distant

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000
we want to study the most distant
 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.940
we want to study the most distant
universe we have to stare in one

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950
universe we have to stare in one
 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.620
universe we have to stare in one
direction for months at a time to get

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630
direction for months at a time to get
 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.479
direction for months at a time to get
the information we need because the

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489
the information we need because the
 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:39.920
the information we need because the
things we're trying to see or so faint

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930
things we're trying to see or so faint
 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.139
things we're trying to see or so faint
other times we just have to wait for an

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149
other times we just have to wait for an
 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.720
other times we just have to wait for an
event to occur if we know that a star is

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730
event to occur if we know that a star is
 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.190
event to occur if we know that a star is
going to have a planet that goes in

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200
going to have a planet that goes in
 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.049
going to have a planet that goes in
front of it and block some starlight we

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059
front of it and block some starlight we
 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.160
front of it and block some starlight we
have to wait for the day that that

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170
have to wait for the day that that
 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.069
have to wait for the day that that
occurs so all of these things have can

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079
occurs so all of these things have can
 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.470
occurs so all of these things have can
be scheduled in planned ahead but we

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480
be scheduled in planned ahead but we
 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.939
be scheduled in planned ahead but we
planned that the observatory will last

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949
planned that the observatory will last
 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.750
planned that the observatory will last
at least five years and hope for ten
