I don't want to be around that person

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:06.050
I don't want to be around that person
 

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:08.919
I don't want to be around that person
because I don't trust them anymore and

00:00:08.919 --> 00:00:08.929
because I don't trust them anymore and
 

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:10.900
because I don't trust them anymore and
so my question to them and I've seen

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:10.910
so my question to them and I've seen
 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:12.940
so my question to them and I've seen
this at the very top of some of the

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:12.950
this at the very top of some of the
 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.690
this at the very top of some of the
largest companies globally is what

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:16.700
largest companies globally is what
 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.790
largest companies globally is what
caused that trust to break down and we

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:18.800
caused that trust to break down and we
 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.940
caused that trust to break down and we
each interpret even that word trust

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:20.950
each interpret even that word trust
 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.440
each interpret even that word trust
differently and so you have to break it

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:23.450
differently and so you have to break it
 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:26.500
differently and so you have to break it
down into behaviors and so when you're

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:26.510
down into behaviors and so when you're
 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:29.830
down into behaviors and so when you're
trying to reconnect with someone is you

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:29.840
trying to reconnect with someone is you
 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.750
trying to reconnect with someone is you
know going back to what initially caused

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:31.760
know going back to what initially caused
 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.329
know going back to what initially caused
that break to happen and question your

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:34.339
that break to happen and question your
 

00:00:34.339 --> 00:00:37.630
that break to happen and question your
your bias on many levels including how

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640
your bias on many levels including how
 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.180
your bias on many levels including how
you envision the breakdown and Trust to

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.190
you envision the breakdown and Trust to
 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.989
you envision the breakdown and Trust to
happen and I think it's you know the

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:43.999
happen and I think it's you know the
 

00:00:43.999 --> 00:00:46.630
happen and I think it's you know the
word respect actually the root of it

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640
word respect actually the root of it
 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.110
word respect actually the root of it
means the ability to see one as if again

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120
means the ability to see one as if again
 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.020
means the ability to see one as if again
for the first time and I think we have

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030
for the first time and I think we have
 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:58.180
for the first time and I think we have
to all challenge ourselves to to know

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190
to all challenge ourselves to to know
 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.279
to all challenge ourselves to to know
that because someone was difficult in

00:01:00.279 --> 00:01:00.289
that because someone was difficult in
 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:02.619
that because someone was difficult in
one situation or even multitudes of

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629
one situation or even multitudes of
 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:04.420
one situation or even multitudes of
situations it doesn't mean they're going

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430
situations it doesn't mean they're going
 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.940
situations it doesn't mean they're going
to be difficult forever that we're

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950
to be difficult forever that we're
 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.600
to be difficult forever that we're
constantly working on this ability that

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610
constantly working on this ability that
 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.819
constantly working on this ability that
we all have and this necessity we all

00:01:12.819 --> 00:01:12.829
we all have and this necessity we all
 

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:15.010
we all have and this necessity we all
have to connect and maybe you know

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020
have to connect and maybe you know
 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.870
have to connect and maybe you know
there's multitudes of other things going

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880
there's multitudes of other things going
 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.149
there's multitudes of other things going
on but to constantly come back to that

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:19.159
on but to constantly come back to that
 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:21.580
on but to constantly come back to that
place of okay what do I need in order

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590
place of okay what do I need in order
 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.600
place of okay what do I need in order
right now here in this moment to build

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:24.610
right now here in this moment to build
 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:31.109
right now here in this moment to build
connection with this person I would add

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:31.119
connection with this person I would add
 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:34.029
connection with this person I would add
forgiveness as powerful mm-hmm

00:01:34.029 --> 00:01:34.039
forgiveness as powerful mm-hmm
 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:35.380

I'd say second and third and fourth

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390
I'd say second and third and fourth
 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.480
I'd say second and third and fourth
chances and I agree with you that people

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490
chances and I agree with you that people
 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.179
chances and I agree with you that people
change so how somebody was in a

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189
change so how somebody was in a
 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:42.010
change so how somebody was in a
particular context or situation might

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020
particular context or situation might
 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.990
particular context or situation might
not have been their best self there may

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000
not have been their best self there may
 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.359
not have been their best self there may
have been intervening circumstances so I

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369
have been intervening circumstances so I
 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:48.490
have been intervening circumstances so I
don't think we can can we ever really

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500
don't think we can can we ever really
 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.459
don't think we can can we ever really
say that someone is this way with me and

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:51.469
say that someone is this way with me and
 

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:53.980
say that someone is this way with me and
I know that it's a fact I really learned

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990
I know that it's a fact I really learned
 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.990
I know that it's a fact I really learned
that you know there's there's no door

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000
that you know there's there's no door
 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.959
that you know there's there's no door
that's ever really closed and unless I

00:01:58.959 --> 00:01:58.969
that's ever really closed and unless I
 

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:00.789
that's ever really closed and unless I
think it is and sometimes I'm wrong many

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799
think it is and sometimes I'm wrong many
 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:03.190
think it is and sometimes I'm wrong many
times I'm wrong about that so I do

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200
times I'm wrong about that so I do
 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.200
times I'm wrong about that so I do
really challenge myself to look at every

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210
really challenge myself to look at every
 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.020
really challenge myself to look at every
situation in person and new as often as

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030
situation in person and new as often as
 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.340
situation in person and new as often as
I can and sometimes that includes

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350
I can and sometimes that includes
 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.460
I can and sometimes that includes
forgiveness it includes the

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470
forgiveness it includes the
 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.309
forgiveness it includes the
acknowledgement that maybe Europe

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319
acknowledgement that maybe Europe
 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:16.080
acknowledgement that maybe Europe
about what happened is a subjective one

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090
about what happened is a subjective one
 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.410
about what happened is a subjective one
I may not be a reality yeah and it comes

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420
I may not be a reality yeah and it comes
 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.319
I may not be a reality yeah and it comes
back to always you know the more certain

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:22.329
back to always you know the more certain
 

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:25.709
back to always you know the more certain
we are the more stuck we will remain so

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:25.719
we are the more stuck we will remain so
 

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:28.410
we are the more stuck we will remain so
if I am certain a person is a certain

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420
if I am certain a person is a certain
 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.990
if I am certain a person is a certain
way she's a certain thing that creates

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000
way she's a certain thing that creates
 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.899
way she's a certain thing that creates
this you know it creates certainty so

00:02:33.899 --> 00:02:33.909
this you know it creates certainty so
 

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:36.030
this you know it creates certainty so
again it's shifting from certainty to

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040
again it's shifting from certainty to
 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.339
again it's shifting from certainty to
discovery and I'm not saying this is

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:38.349
discovery and I'm not saying this is
 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:41.069
discovery and I'm not saying this is
easy it's it's difficult I've been in

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:41.079
easy it's it's difficult I've been in
 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:43.110
easy it's it's difficult I've been in
some of the literally toughest

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120
some of the literally toughest
 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.989
some of the literally toughest
conversations with people where someone

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:45.999
conversations with people where someone
 

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:49.319
conversations with people where someone
is so close what we literally would say

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:49.329
is so close what we literally would say
 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:51.449
is so close what we literally would say
is absolutely close minded like it

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459
is absolutely close minded like it
 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:53.399
is absolutely close minded like it
doesn't matter what I say or do they are

00:02:53.399 --> 00:02:53.409
doesn't matter what I say or do they are
 

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:56.819
doesn't matter what I say or do they are
of that opinion they are so certain in

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:56.829
of that opinion they are so certain in
 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:00.449
of that opinion they are so certain in
that moment you do need to ask yourself

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459
that moment you do need to ask yourself
 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:02.399
that moment you do need to ask yourself
how do I want to leave this conversation

00:03:02.399 --> 00:03:02.409
how do I want to leave this conversation
 

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:04.619
how do I want to leave this conversation
I know I have enough self-respect and

00:03:04.619 --> 00:03:04.629
I know I have enough self-respect and
 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:06.390
I know I have enough self-respect and

inclusion that I want to leave this
person with I hear where your you are

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730
person with I hear where your you are
 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.270
person with I hear where your you are
coming from and I hope one day you'll be

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280
coming from and I hope one day you'll be
 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.839
coming from and I hope one day you'll be
able to listen to where I'm coming from

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:17.849
able to listen to where I'm coming from
 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:21.270
able to listen to where I'm coming from
you know so it's always that how do you

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280
you know so it's always that how do you
 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.219
you know so it's always that how do you
want to leave that conversation with

want to leave that conversation with
 

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:25.469
want to leave that conversation with
that sense of self respect is ultimately

00:03:25.469 --> 00:03:25.479
that sense of self respect is ultimately
 

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:27.749
that sense of self respect is ultimately
what is so important you can't change

00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:27.759
what is so important you can't change
 

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:31.050
what is so important you can't change
people in that moment but you can

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060
people in that moment but you can
 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.199
people in that moment but you can
respect yourself and you can at least

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209
respect yourself and you can at least
 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:36.360
respect yourself and you can at least
have them have the experience of being

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370
have them have the experience of being
 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.369
have them have the experience of being
respected they may not be able to show

00:03:38.369 --> 00:03:38.379
respected they may not be able to show
 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:40.770
respected they may not be able to show
the same to you but we have to be

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780
the same to you but we have to be
 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.080
the same to you but we have to be
willing to be okay that we don't agree

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090
willing to be okay that we don't agree
 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.539
willing to be okay that we don't agree
but it doesn't mean we disrespect one

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:45.549
but it doesn't mean we disrespect one
 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:50.610
but it doesn't mean we disrespect one
another or have to disconnect because

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620
another or have to disconnect because
 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.039
another or have to disconnect because
until we can bridge and find these

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049
until we can bridge and find these
 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:55.920
until we can bridge and find these
places where we can connect where our

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930
places where we can connect where our
 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.129
places where we can connect where our
differences lie we'll eventually

00:03:59.129 --> 00:03:59.139
differences lie we'll eventually
 

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:01.379
differences lie we'll eventually
hopefully be the places we can bridge

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:01.389
