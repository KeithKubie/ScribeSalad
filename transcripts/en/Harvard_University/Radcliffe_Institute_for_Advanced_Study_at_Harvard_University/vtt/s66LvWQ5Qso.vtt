[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:08.690
- Good afternoon, and
welcome to Radcliffe.

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:10.490
My name is Janet Rich-Edwards.

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:14.000
I am the Faculty Director for
the Life Sciences programming

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.950
here at Radcliffe,
and an epidemiologist

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:20.694
at the school across the
road there, across the river.

00:00:20.694 --> 00:00:22.110
I particularly
want to welcome you

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.620
to this, our second lecture, in
the Epidemics Science Lecture

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:26.730
Series.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.400
If you haven't picked up
one of these hot pink cards,

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.280
they're in the way back
when you're on your way out.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.100
In addition to this terrific
lecture that we have today,

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.700
we're also going to be talking
about the epidemic of poverty

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.400
a week from today,
later on, obesity,

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.920
more complex than you
think, and Alzheimer's.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.550
So these promise to be, I
think, really exciting lectures,

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.520
and we're certainly glad
to have really, very

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.840
qualified, and
thrilling faculty,

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.280
including Dr. Anne
Louise Oaklander,

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.800
who will be talking today about
small fibers, and big pain.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.570
She's Associate Professor of
Neurology at Harvard Medical

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:02.610
School.

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.220
She was trained at Rutgers,
and at Johns Hopkins,

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.790
has both an M.D. And
a PhD in neuroscience.

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.440
She directs MGHs nerve unit,
and a federally funded research

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.260
team at Mass General that
studies peripheral nerve

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.000
disorders.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.440
Her team has discovered a new
neuropathy common in children

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.740
and young adults, and its
first treatment, which

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.380
is an immunotherapy, and
she'll talk about that today.

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.060
They've also linked fibromyalgia
to small fiber neuropathy.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.060
She served on advisory
panels for the NIH, the FDA,

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.437
and the Institute of Medicine.

00:01:38.437 --> 00:01:40.770
I will take a moment to tell
you how we're going to run.

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.940
Dr. Oaklander will
talk, give her talk,

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.600
and then we're going to open
up to you guys for about

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.880
a half hour of questions.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.860
We have a roving mic
that can come to you,

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.870
and I would just
say at this point,

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:56.670
while Dr. Oaklander, I'm sure,
is a very good clinician,

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.960
this is not going to be
a clinical consultation.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.830
So you might think now,
if you have questions

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.750
about personal things
you've experienced,

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.840
how to phrase it in a
way that is more general,

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.540
and applicable to everybody.

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.612
So I encourage you to do that.

00:02:15.612 --> 00:02:18.070
And I think with no further
ado, let's welcome Dr. Oakland.

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.560
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:28.930
- Thank you, Janet.

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.340
Now, what was that
word you used?

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.440
Was it thrilling?

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.780
Thrilling, did
she say thrilling?

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.470
Wow, that's a tall
order, and I guess

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.390
it's appropriate
because I understand

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.040
that there are people here
from even other states.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.710
Did anybody come here
from another state,

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:49.450
drive a long distance?

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:50.290
Where are you from?

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:51.700
- New Hampshire.

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.080
- New Hampshire, OK.

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.780
Not that far.

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.090
How about far off states?

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:59.900
Wisconsin.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.240
OK, does she get the
prize for farthest

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:08.720
driving in cold weather
to come hear this talk?

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.140
Anyway, I'll certainly
try to be thrilling,

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.430
and it's always hard
to talk about science

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:17.540
with a mixed audience.

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.970
Some of the people here
are faculty members,

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.190
or graduate students, some
are members of the public,

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.540
there's people who know a lot,
people who don't necessarily

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.570
know a lot, have a lot of
interest I'm going to try

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:32.540
and see if I can
straddle things a bit,

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.140
but don't worry if you don't
understand every single word

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:37.530
on every slide.

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.080
It's intended sometimes,
for trying to satisfy those

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.620
who might have great curiosity.

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:48.600
I'll start at the
simple beginning,

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.890
which is what are nerves,
and what is neuropathy?

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.050
That's what we're
talking about today.

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:55.670
The peripheral
nerves is the part

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:57.890
of the nervous
system that's outside

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:59.330
of the brain and
the spinal cord.

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.163
That's what a lot of
people think about when

00:04:01.163 --> 00:04:02.690
they think of neurology.

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:04.430
What we're talking
about today is

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:09.260
the wiring that connects our
CPU to the outside world.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.370
When we take a cross-section
through a peripheral nerve

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.970
of a human, we can see
these small fibers,

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.100
which are the kind
of nerve axons

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.470
that I'll be
talking about today.

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.630
These are these tiny
little thin guys.

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.940
That's why they're
called small fibers.

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.880
There's a bunch of different
ones including C-fibers,

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.790
A-deltas, and autonomics.

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:37.100
Because of these many different
functions, as you'll see,

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.340
polyneuropathy can have
different medical causes,

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.360
and cause different symptoms.

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.850
The functions of
these small fibers

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:51.630
are so diverse that when
people develop neuropathies

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:54.090
that affect them,
they can just develop

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.070
a lot of different symptoms.

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:59.010
And we're going to go over
some of those symptoms,

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:01.290
but I think there's an
underlying problem, which

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:04.860
is that a lot of patients who
have this kind of neuropathy,

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.720
it's not even picked up.

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.440
They're searching for answers.

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.580
They know they've got problems
in more than one organ system.

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.590
People haven't put
the pieces together.

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:18.510
It's like the blind
men and the elephant.

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:21.180
So let's go over
some of the symptoms,

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.190
and again, not every
patient has every symptoms,

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.470
and I'm not able to talk
about all of the symptoms.

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:29.400
So I'm just focusing on
the most common ones,

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.540
and clearly, one of them
is chronic widespread pain.

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:36.750
That means it's not like
you fell down, and banged

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.760
your knee, and you
have pain in your leg,

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.830
but it's really pain
affecting both sides

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:43.890
of your body for
no clear reason,

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:45.490
or no better explanation.

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.780
Pain from small fiber neuropathy
comes in two varieties.

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:56.130
So the most common is
so-called distal pain,

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:59.220
which means it starts in
the feet and the hands.

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:02.820
And I've shown you a picture
of a woman, a patient of mine,

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:06.390
who has the erythromelalgia
phenotype, which

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:10.980
means that in addition to having
painful legs, they're also red,

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:11.970
and they're swollen.

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:14.040
So when we see those
three things together,

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.230
the Greek for that
is erythromelalgia.

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:20.570
It's just a particular flavor
of small fiber neuropathy.

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:22.430
Not everybody with
erythromelalgia

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:26.130
has this neuropathy,
but at least 50% do.

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:29.130
And for those of you with a
particular interest in this,

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:33.570
there is May 9th,
Erythromelalgia Awareness Day

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:37.620
with events at the Statehouse
on the other side of the river,

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:39.900
including yours truly.

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:42.720
But not everybody has pain
that starts in the feet.

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:45.480
About one quarter of
patients, it starts elsewhere,

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:50.040
and you can see this woman has
the erythromelalgia as well.

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:52.440
Equally, perhaps
even more common,

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:56.537
are cardiovascular symptoms,
except people don't say gee,

00:06:56.537 --> 00:06:57.120
you know what?

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:00.610
I woke up this morning, and I
got cardiovascular symptoms.

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:02.820
What is it that
they actually say?

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:04.770
They say you know, I
woke up this morning,

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:06.270
and I can't get out of bed.

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:07.290
I feel lousy.

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:08.420
I feel terrible.

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:10.720
Maybe I'm coming
down with something.

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:13.420
But the problem is when
it goes on day after day,

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:16.800
week after week, month after
month, year after year,

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.450
it's not just that
you have the flu.

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:20.970
Something different
is going on, and it

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:23.670
can be very
difficult to pinpoint

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:26.190
what exactly the cause is.

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:30.060
The kind of cardiovascular
problems that are most common

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:33.240
is you can see here,
this poor guard standing

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:36.270
on duty for hour after
hour has fainted.

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:38.770
Something called
orthostatic hypotension,

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:42.030
which means people can feel
dizzy, or actually faint,

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:43.770
typically, when
they're standing up.

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:45.720
Sometimes after meals.

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:48.360
Another one is just
chronic fatigue--

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:50.520
inability to do
your normal routine.

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:53.460
We're going to talk more
about that in the next slide,

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:55.680
but I wanted to particularly
draw your attention

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:58.500
to my colleague David
Systrom at Brigham

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:00.870
who specializes in
this, and he knows

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:06.720
more about this kind of causes
of fatigue than anyone I know.

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:09.720
So he's the one to talk to.

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:12.690
Patient education, which
I suspect there are a few

00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:15.660
of you in the audience who
maybe some of your patients.

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:17.220
Maybe some of you
might find out you

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:20.070
are patients from this talk.

00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:22.710
Is education is just
critically important

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:26.130
because very often, there's
so much stuff you can do.

00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:28.380
If you just understand
what's going on,

00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:30.720
you can control things yourself.

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:34.260
And in that sense, patient
advocates and patient support

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:35.419
groups are very important.

00:08:35.419 --> 00:08:37.409
I see Leslie Levine here.

00:08:37.409 --> 00:08:39.000
Can you raise your hand, Leslie?

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.950
Who runs one of the
local support groups.

00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:43.740
So she's a resource, and
I wanted to point out

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:45.570
Dysautonomia International.

00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:47.820
Can you folks raise
your hand as well?

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:49.620
Are you national
or international?

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:50.400
- International

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:53.224
- International support
group for patients.

00:08:53.224 --> 00:08:54.890
Do you have some
literature in the back?

00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:56.782
- [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:56.782 --> 00:08:58.490
- That sounds great,
and they're not even

00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:00.950
paying me anything
to say this, truly.

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:04.630
In fact-- yeah, definitely not.

00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:06.170
And so these are
some of the things

00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:09.440
that patients can learn to
do to control their symptoms,

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:11.030
improve them themselves.

00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:14.330
I think first and foremost, is
the use of support stockings,

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:16.130
and I like that
photo because it goes

00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:20.870
to show that support stockings
don't all have to be ugly.

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:23.960
So here's some science behind
this, for those of you that

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:27.920
are so inclined, and
this explains, I think,

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:32.300
the best explanation for
why people with neuropathy

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:35.540
can have this kind of fatigue,
and inability to get out

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:38.330
of bed, and do their routine.

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:40.460
These are microscope
slides, unfortunately,

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:44.960
not out of my lab, but out of a
very skilled colleague of mine.

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:50.150
And what these show is muscle
cells under the microscope.

00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:52.370
I think they're best seen here.

00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:54.980
But the focus is not on the
muscle cells themselves,

00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:57.020
it's on the blood
vessels that bring

00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:59.770
the blood, the oxygen, the
glucose, the cookies you just

00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:03.320
ate stayed downstairs on
the way in to the muscles

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:05.690
so that the muscles
can do their job.

00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:08.210
And the problem that
these patients have--

00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:11.780
the muscles are still there, but
what you can see in the slides

00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:14.060
from the top with
a healthy person

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:16.550
is there are all these
axons, these nerve

00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:19.730
cells that come
running down, and they

00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:22.040
control the blood vessels.

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:23.930
See this round
blood vessel here?

00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:26.420
The little yellow
squiggles are the nerves

00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:29.270
that tell the blood vessel
when to open and close.

00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:32.540
And what you can see is in
the slides from the bottom,

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:35.600
there's far fewer nerves,
and the blood vessel

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:36.650
is gaping open.

00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:40.460
So the point is that when
your nerves are messed up,

00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:42.440
they control the blood
vessels, your muscles

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:44.870
may not get the
oxygen and nutrients

00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:46.220
they need to function.

00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:48.800
And in many people,
not all, that's

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:50.990
why they can't get out
of bed in the morning

00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:53.640
when they have neuropathy.

00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:56.930
This is an emerging area that
I think is of great importance,

00:10:56.930 --> 00:10:58.610
hasn't been
addressed, and that's

00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:01.370
the fact that small fiber
neuropathy can actually

00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:03.990
affect the brain as well.

00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:08.139
And so it happens in
a variety of ways.

00:11:08.139 --> 00:11:09.680
They haven't been
adequately studied.

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:12.380
I hope there might be
some brain scientist

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:15.230
or experimental psychologists
here in the audience who

00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:18.290
might become interested in
taking this up themselves,

00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:20.330
and looking into this.

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:22.880
This picture that
you can't see is just

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:26.270
to show you formal
cognitive testing that's

00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:29.390
done on patients who have this
kind of problem when they're

00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:31.940
lying down, flat,
and their blood

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:35.150
can make it to their brain, and
then they're on a tilt table.

00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:38.900
The tilt table stands them up
vertically, just as I am now,

00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:41.780
and their blood can't make it
all the way up to their brain,

00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:44.150
and so their brain
function detriments,

00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:49.760
and that's been captured
in testing, and published.

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:53.660
Gastrointestinal symptoms
are very common as well.

00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:55.700
This is a microscope
slide from my lab.

00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:57.440
Heather Downs, where
are you Heather?

00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:58.880
Raise your hand, Heather.

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:01.100
So Heather Downs
is the person who

00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:04.520
made this slide for you--
this beautiful image that

00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:07.490
shows you these are the
intestinal crypts, and all

00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:10.730
the little squiggly green
lines are the small fibers.

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:13.340
So you can see that your
gut is under the control

00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:15.410
of these nerve
cells, and I think

00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:19.430
that explains why many patients
develop all sorts of symptoms--

00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:24.440
upper GI, lower GI, and they
go to see a gastroenterologist,

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:27.200
but in fact, it
could be neurologic.

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:29.750
In the worst case
scenario, some patients

00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:32.630
lose so much weight from
intractable vomiting

00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:35.390
that they have to be nourished
with a nasogastric tube,

00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:38.720
or some of them even by vein.

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:39.990
Treating these symptoms.

00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:42.650
They can be treated, and again,
if you know what you have,

00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:45.110
if you get the tests
that are recommended,

00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:48.230
there's stuff you can do to
make your gut feel better,

00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:51.480
and calm down from neuropathy.

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:55.520
This also is to show that
it's not worth doing MRIs.

00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:58.310
A lot of patients with
neuropathies have MRIs.

00:12:58.310 --> 00:13:02.000
The only MRI finding here is
that this little boy's colon

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.200
is full of feces.

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:05.630
Again, because he
can't move his bowels

00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:07.940
because the nerves
that control the bowels

00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:09.500
aren't working right.

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:13.130
The bones and joints, even,
are innervated by these nerves.

00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:16.550
Orthopedists, immunologists
don't think of it that much,

00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:19.040
but the bone marrow
even is densely

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:22.490
innervated by this particular
type of small fiber nerve

00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:23.420
endings.

00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:25.460
You can see here in
one of my patients

00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:27.680
with the hereditary
neuropathy, that he's even

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:33.310
had loss of the bones in
the ends of his fingers.

00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:35.230
In order to track
all these symptoms,

00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:37.180
there are so many
that we realized

00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:38.890
we had to develop
our questionnaire,

00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:41.990
and there was no questionnaire
anywhere in the world.

00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:45.160
And so with the help of my
former post-doctoral fellow,

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:48.260
Roy Treister, we developed
this questionnaire.

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:51.190
We're continuing to
improve it, right Gary?

00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:52.810
With Gary Zirpoli.

00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:54.760
But we've published
at least one paper

00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:57.430
that shows reasonable
validation,

00:13:57.430 --> 00:13:58.850
and performance of this.

00:13:58.850 --> 00:14:01.660
And these are questions--
you can't read it,

00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:05.470
but this is something that
is increasingly available.

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:08.290
This captures the symptoms
we've heard from our patients,

00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:11.500
not just what's in the textbook.

00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:16.820
OK, so what are the tests
that can confirm small fiber?

00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:20.630
As you can see, the neuro
exam is not that sensitive,

00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:23.300
and may not pick it up.

00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:24.830
The usual tests--

00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:27.310
EMG nerve conduction
study don't detect it.

00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:30.170
Even nerve biopsies
may not pick it up.

00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:32.240
So skin biopsy is
really the test

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:35.630
that we recommend, and again,
Heather Downs is the person who

00:14:35.630 --> 00:14:38.630
manages our skin biopsy lab.

00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:40.880
These biopsies sound
worse than they are.

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:42.680
They're done under
local anesthesia,

00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:44.330
but they need to
be done by somebody

00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:46.430
who knows what they're doing.

00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:49.520
They can be requested to be
performed at Mass General,

00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:52.280
or a doc locally can
do them, and ship them

00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:54.680
into Mass General for analysis.

00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:57.910
Either way, the instructions
for this are on our website.

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:03.800
Max Klein, and others from our
group, have done a lot of work

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:07.010
on the normative data,
and these are studies that

00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:08.930
depend on normal volunteers.

00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:12.110
More than 400 of them
have come to our lab,

00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:14.960
and allowed us to remove
a tiny bit of skin,

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:16.760
and measure the nerve endings.

00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:20.600
And I show this to you, showing
you these more than 500.

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:23.480
What you can see is
these normal people

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:26.510
vary a lot in the amount of
nerve endings they start with.

00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:30.920
Normal kids, the red marks here,
have far more nerve endings

00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:33.710
to begin with than
normal adults do,

00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:37.040
and the problem is is that
a lot of the commercial labs

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:40.670
just use one threshold,
and if the count that's

00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:43.170
measured in you is above the
threshold, they say fine,

00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:44.080
you're normal.

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:46.940
It's below the threshold, they
say oh, you've got neuropathy.

00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:48.710
But it's really much
more mathematically

00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:50.240
complex than that.

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:53.160
We've done modeling, and so
when you have a skin biopsy

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:56.090
please ask which lab
your biopsy is being

00:15:56.090 --> 00:15:58.220
sent to for interpretation.

00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:01.327
And for young people,
our lab is the only one

00:16:01.327 --> 00:16:03.410
that I know of anywhere
in the world with accurate

00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:06.320
norms for kids and teens.

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:08.300
We're big fans of
physiology, which

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:10.700
means how the nervous
system is functioning,

00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:14.060
not necessarily what it looks
like under the microscope.

00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:16.670
The test there--
autonomic function test,

00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:19.730
as far as I know, Mass
General and the Brigham

00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:23.030
are the places that offer
them here in Boston.

00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:25.580
They measure a bunch
of different aspects

00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:27.500
of nervous system
functions Sweating

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:29.270
is particularly important.

00:16:29.270 --> 00:16:31.910
Something called the QSART,
and this person here,

00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:37.914
has loss of normal sweating
from the ends of their legs.

00:16:37.914 --> 00:16:40.580
So let's turn a little bit now--
now that you know the symptoms,

00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:42.830
and you know the
tests for neuropathy,

00:16:42.830 --> 00:16:45.350
let's turn a little bit to
some of our discoveries.

00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:50.930
Neuropathy-- anybody here who's
a physician in the audience

00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:53.270
will agree that
what we were trained

00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:55.890
is that neuropathy
affects over people.

00:16:55.890 --> 00:17:00.230
Diabetes, cancer chemotherapy,
these are the common causes.

00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:02.450
So one of the things
that's come out of our lab

00:17:02.450 --> 00:17:05.450
that I think has
been very useful

00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:08.900
is the information that
neuropathy affects kids

00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:12.230
much more often than
anybody realized.

00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:16.069
And we knew that there were
some rare genetic causes.

00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:19.970
Our lab is very interested in
genetic causes of neuropathy,

00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:24.680
and in so far as I
know, Mass General

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:27.020
is really the place
to come for families

00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:29.990
with these kind of neuropathies.

00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:33.020
We have a Nerve Gene
Family Clinic where

00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:34.730
we can see entire families.

00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:38.420
You can see these
three very nice boys

00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:40.580
that are photographed here.

00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:44.660
We're interested in other
genetic neuropathies as well,

00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:51.050
and this shows another family
we follow that has HSAn1.

00:17:51.050 --> 00:17:55.630
Remember, I showed you the dad,
and his terrible hand up there?

00:17:55.630 --> 00:17:58.700
We're seeing his
daughters in our clinic

00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:02.270
as well with the idea of trying
to treat their neuropathy

00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:04.400
before it gets so bad.

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:05.420
Karen, are you here?

00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:08.860
Karen Weintraub.

00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:09.640
Karen's done it.

00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:10.420
Oh, there she is.

00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:12.650
She's lurking in the back.

00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:15.220
She's got a terrific job
of helping us to bring this

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:20.290
to awareness, and there's more
information on the Stat website

00:18:20.290 --> 00:18:22.440
if you're interested.

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:24.650
But how about
non-genetic causes?

00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:27.740
Everything I've shown
you before is very rare.

00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:30.650
Again, kids were not thought
to have neuropathy because they

00:18:30.650 --> 00:18:33.470
don't have the medical
causes of neuropathy,

00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:37.550
and I believed the party
line until I met this college

00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:40.010
student from New
Hampshire who got

00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:43.100
admitted to Brigham with
severe pain out of nowhere.

00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:45.540
Very healthy guy, but
look at those legs.

00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:47.840
That's that
erythromelalgia again.

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:51.270
And we figured out that in him,
it was small fiber neuropathy,

00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:54.590
but we really had no idea
why he should have it.

00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:57.110
All of his tests
came back normal.

00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:59.360
On a hunch that it
might be autoimmune,

00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:01.100
we started treating
him for that,

00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:03.770
and literally within
an hour or two,

00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:05.670
his pain started to improve.

00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:09.560
So this was truly what's
called the index case,

00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:11.750
and it changed my
career, and now

00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:14.210
look at how many other people
are hearing this story.

00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:17.570
So the importance of
one patient's story.

00:19:17.570 --> 00:19:20.250
Well, one patient is
not proof of anything,

00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:21.890
and so with Max Klein--

00:19:21.890 --> 00:19:25.670
Max, there you are,
my right hand person.

00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:29.600
We went back and looked at the
records of all the young people

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:33.740
we'd seen with the onset of
chronic pain before age 21,

00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:35.630
and Max and I
published this paper

00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:39.920
in the Journal of Pediatrics
in 2013 that really laid out

00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:43.970
this new disease that had
never before been described.

00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:46.490
And again, you can see some
of the characteristics.

00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:50.330
3/4 of the patients
were girls or women.

00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:53.480
Some of them were grown now, but
they've had the onset of pain

00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:55.470
before age 21.

00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:57.260
And again, look at all
the different kinds

00:19:57.260 --> 00:19:58.430
of symptoms they have.

00:19:58.430 --> 00:19:59.810
You guys know all this stuff.

00:19:59.810 --> 00:20:02.360
Oh, I can skip this slide now.

00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:04.700
It just shows you that a
lot of these young people

00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:07.390
had abnormalities on
their skin biopsies,

00:20:07.390 --> 00:20:09.170
or on their autonomic
function tests.

00:20:09.170 --> 00:20:12.020
It really showed
objective evidence

00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:14.210
that they had neuropathy.

00:20:14.210 --> 00:20:16.100
So we looked at
these young people

00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:19.100
to figure out-- what
was it, 41, I think?

00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:20.720
To figure out what
the cause were,

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:23.600
and then well, none of them
had the genetic diseases

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:26.000
that you just heard
about, and they

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.790
didn't have family histories.

00:20:28.790 --> 00:20:31.370
What came out is that
although some of them

00:20:31.370 --> 00:20:35.120
were said to have psychiatric
problems, in fact,

00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:36.920
and had hospitalizations,
none of them

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:39.390
really had serious
psych diseases.

00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:41.330
But what they did
have is a history

00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:45.830
of autoimmune illnesses, or
when your immune system begins

00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:48.200
to attack your own body.

00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:50.990
That paper was published in
the pediatric literature,

00:20:50.990 --> 00:20:53.300
but it's important
to realize that there

00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:55.280
are a lot of these
people who began

00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:58.580
to be sick during their
teen or early adult years,

00:20:58.580 --> 00:21:01.460
and they may now be in
their 40s, 50s, or 60s,

00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:04.100
and they could still
have this, and still

00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:06.320
improve with treatment.

00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:09.470
So we next started with
prospective studies,

00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:13.400
where we specifically recruited
people, and matched controls

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:16.370
to further test this
hypothesis, and we

00:21:16.370 --> 00:21:19.580
chose to study fibromyalgia.

00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:21.410
Anybody have fibromyalgia here?

00:21:21.410 --> 00:21:23.000
Anybody been told.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.810
Wow, OK, so this is of interest.

00:21:26.810 --> 00:21:31.010
Fibromyalgia affects 1%
to 5% of the population

00:21:31.010 --> 00:21:35.300
in the literature, and there's
a consensus case definition,

00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:37.740
which makes it
good for research.

00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:41.060
We looked at all the different
measures of small fiber

00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:43.590
neuropathy we had
at our disposal,

00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:47.090
but we particularly prioritized
the objective test results

00:21:47.090 --> 00:21:51.320
because they can't be
faked or exaggerated,

00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:56.120
and that study showed that 40%
of the fibromyalgia patients

00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:59.900
versus only one in the
group had objective evidence

00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:01.516
of neuropathy.

00:22:01.516 --> 00:22:03.140
Kind of hard to get
that one published.

00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:05.210
What I was saying
sounded so strange

00:22:05.210 --> 00:22:09.860
because no one's really found
any biological underpinnings

00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:11.040
until then.

00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:12.860
But of course, what's
happened since is

00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:15.350
I know of more than
a dozen studies that

00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:16.760
have looked at
this, and they all

00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:18.030
are reporting the same thing.

00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:20.720
It doesn't cause
all of fibromyalgia,

00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:24.050
but what we would say
a substantial minority.

00:22:24.050 --> 00:22:26.090
And again, there
is a review article

00:22:26.090 --> 00:22:28.160
that came out in
Scientific American

00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:31.850
Mind that talks to some of
the different investigators.

00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:34.610
This study is for the
technicians in the audience,

00:22:34.610 --> 00:22:39.650
and it explains how small fiber
neuropathy can cause pain,

00:22:39.650 --> 00:22:40.970
and that it's similar.

00:22:40.970 --> 00:22:44.180
When they look and study
patients with fibromyalgia,

00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:47.360
and small fiber, they find
the same electrophysiologic

00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:50.350
abnormalities, where
these pain neurons,

00:22:50.350 --> 00:22:52.940
they're normally only
supposed to fire if somebody's

00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:54.920
sticking a knife
or a pin in you,

00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:56.750
but they're firing
spontaneously.

00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:57.920
Those nerves are active.

00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:00.470
They're sending pain
messages up to your brain,

00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:03.770
even when nothing painful is
actually happening to you,

00:23:03.770 --> 00:23:06.980
and those pain neurons
also fire excessively,

00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:09.110
and in a prolonged way.

00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:12.830
This other very technical slide
from my colleague Frank Rice

00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:17.270
from Albany shows evidence
under the microscope

00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:21.840
that the arteriovenous shunts,
again, the blood vessels,

00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:26.070
are abnormal in these
patients with fibromyalgia.

00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:29.130
And again, it's the blood
vessel abnormalities

00:23:29.130 --> 00:23:31.470
that we think underlies
some of the symptoms

00:23:31.470 --> 00:23:35.700
we see like erythromelalgia.

00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:37.560
With Max, we turned
our attention

00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:42.360
to another unexplained
similar vague illness

00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:44.440
known as Gulf War Illness.

00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:47.070
That's still a
problem now for people

00:23:47.070 --> 00:23:52.650
who were in the Gulf War in
the first and second Gulf Wars

00:23:52.650 --> 00:23:55.950
in the early 90s.

00:23:55.950 --> 00:23:57.960
We have several
grants from the DOD,

00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:01.830
and Max's study shows
strong evidence that some

00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:03.990
of the veterans--
not all of them--

00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:06.090
with Gulf War
Illness, probably have

00:24:06.090 --> 00:24:09.390
the same underlying
early onset small fiber

00:24:09.390 --> 00:24:12.600
that came on at the time
they were military recruits,

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:16.090
and it's persisted.

00:24:16.090 --> 00:24:18.700
The next step if you're
diagnosed with neuropathy

00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:20.690
is to figure out
what the cause is,

00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:23.110
and again, indeed, there are
a lot of different underlying

00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:24.340
causes.

00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:28.420
We recommend that patients
speak with their doctor

00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:30.470
about getting these
blood tests performed.

00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:33.850
These are the ones that are
supported by published papers

00:24:33.850 --> 00:24:35.830
in the medical literature.

00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:38.960
We've looked into this
ourselves, as I'll show you.

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:41.590
And it's really
important to figure out

00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:44.860
what the cause is in each
person so you can treat it.

00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:49.710
This blood test checklist
is available on our website.

00:24:49.710 --> 00:24:51.840
When these tests
were administered

00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:54.450
to the young people,
we didn't find evidence

00:24:54.450 --> 00:24:57.360
that they had diabetes
or heavy metal toxicity.

00:24:57.360 --> 00:24:59.430
The only thing
really that came up

00:24:59.430 --> 00:25:01.530
were blood tests
that are associated

00:25:01.530 --> 00:25:04.560
with autoimmune conditions,
and the majority

00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:06.870
of the patients, the
young onset patients,

00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:10.080
did have immune markers.

00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:13.290
When we step back to look at
the value of these blood tests

00:25:13.290 --> 00:25:18.690
in patients of all ages who have
idiopathic neuropathy-- what

00:25:18.690 --> 00:25:19.837
does idiopathic mean?

00:25:19.837 --> 00:25:21.420
It sounds like that's
the cause of it.

00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:23.370
That's the kind of
neuropathy you have.

00:25:23.370 --> 00:25:27.180
If a doctor tells you that
you have idiopathic anything,

00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:28.770
just saying no.

00:25:28.770 --> 00:25:30.720
That's not a diagnosis.

00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:35.850
Idiopathic is Latin
for we are idiots.

00:25:35.850 --> 00:25:38.730
All it means is the
doctor doesn't actually

00:25:38.730 --> 00:25:40.710
know what the cause is in you.

00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:43.860
And so they turn it into
Latin, and then the patient

00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:46.560
thinks oh, I've got
a diagnosis now.

00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:49.920
I've got idiopathic neuropathy.

00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:51.000
Not so much.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:54.000
Press your doctor for
the real diagnosis.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.520
We looked at these
blood tests in patients

00:25:56.520 --> 00:26:02.130
with idiopathic small fiber
neuropathy, and what we found

00:26:02.130 --> 00:26:05.550
is that we could pick up an
underlying medical abnormality

00:26:05.550 --> 00:26:08.520
that could be causal in
more than half of them.

00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:12.510
Very surprisingly, it turned
out that diabetes and high blood

00:26:12.510 --> 00:26:16.410
sugar, which is said to be the
most common cause of neuropathy

00:26:16.410 --> 00:26:20.830
in the US, was not common
in this population.

00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:22.290
The reason for
that is that people

00:26:22.290 --> 00:26:24.960
who have diabetes, and who
develop burning and tingling

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:27.570
in their feet, or
nausea, they kind of

00:26:27.570 --> 00:26:29.910
know that they have
diabetic neuropathy,

00:26:29.910 --> 00:26:32.910
and they're not
labeled as idiopathic.

00:26:32.910 --> 00:26:35.340
In fact, again,
we found evidence

00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:40.890
of unsuspected immune
blood test abnormalities.

00:26:40.890 --> 00:26:44.580
Well, all this medical
stuff and research,

00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:48.480
it's all fine and dandy, but
at the end of the day, what

00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:51.420
the patients want,
what the doctors want,

00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:55.350
what even the insurance
companies want is treatment.

00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:57.670
That's really what
it's all about.

00:26:57.670 --> 00:26:59.370
And so the
information that we've

00:26:59.370 --> 00:27:01.680
gathered from our
patients has enabled

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:03.690
us to start treating them.

00:27:03.690 --> 00:27:06.570
In the study of
the young people,

00:27:06.570 --> 00:27:10.020
it wasn't everybody who
got immunotherapy, only 15

00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:12.150
among that very small group.

00:27:12.150 --> 00:27:15.820
The immunotherapy helped
about 80% of them.

00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:18.220
So very high level.

00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:21.780
Let's talk for a little bit more
about autoimmune neuropathy,

00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:25.410
and what this is, what this
concept is that we are really

00:27:25.410 --> 00:27:27.720
bringing to public attention.

00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:29.670
So the job of the
immune system is

00:27:29.670 --> 00:27:33.930
to protect our body from
outside invaders like the flu.

00:27:33.930 --> 00:27:38.340
I think every one of us knows
that the flu is going around.

00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:41.340
But what happens sometimes
is those immune cells

00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:43.880
can be fooled, and
mistakenly attack

00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:47.070
some of our body's
own cells, mistakenly

00:27:47.070 --> 00:27:49.210
thinking that they're invaders.

00:27:49.210 --> 00:27:50.820
And there are
autoimmune diseases

00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:53.460
that affect pretty much
every cell in our body.

00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:55.380
Everything from
rheumatoid arthritis,

00:27:55.380 --> 00:27:59.360
to multiple sclerosis,
to vitiligo, you name it,

00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:01.530
there's autoimmune diseases.

00:28:01.530 --> 00:28:04.860
Because the nerves, and the
brain, and the spinal cord

00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:07.290
are so important,
they're actually

00:28:07.290 --> 00:28:11.970
hidden behind an immunologic
barrier which protects them.

00:28:11.970 --> 00:28:15.600
But these small fibers are in
a very interesting situation.

00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:20.190
Since their job, overall, is to
help defend us against threats,

00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:22.770
they actually go
outside the walls,

00:28:22.770 --> 00:28:24.810
and they stick
their cell bodies,

00:28:24.810 --> 00:28:29.190
and they stick their distal
axons outside of the barrier,

00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:32.670
and they are so in-tune
with immune cells,

00:28:32.670 --> 00:28:35.880
they actually secrete
immune mediators,

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:39.840
and they have physical contact
with some of the immune cells,

00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:41.670
in particular, mast cells.

00:28:41.670 --> 00:28:44.310
This shows you the
dorsal root ganglion,

00:28:44.310 --> 00:28:49.060
which is where the cell
bodies, the CPU if you will,

00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:50.880
of these small
fibers is located.

00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:54.340
And as you can see, it's
outside of the spinal cord.

00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:59.070
So not protected from
autoimmune attack.

00:28:59.070 --> 00:29:00.000
What I'm telling you--

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.000
I stand up here, I'm a
Harvard faculty member,

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:06.150
it makes perfect sense, but
the stuff I'm telling you

00:29:06.150 --> 00:29:08.130
is not in the medical textbooks.

00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:12.190
It's controversial.

00:29:12.190 --> 00:29:14.640
But what is it I'm
supposed to be again?

00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:15.330
Exciting?

00:29:15.330 --> 00:29:16.550
- Thrilling

00:29:16.550 --> 00:29:17.360
- Thrilling.

00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:19.680
OK, so I got to tell
you guys stuff that's

00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:24.180
not in the medical textbooks,
and you judge for yourself

00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:26.160
whether what I'm saying
make sense to you.

00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:28.590
What is in the
medical textbook now

00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:33.520
is really only two immune causes
of small fiber neuropathy,

00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:38.100
of which a rhemotologic disease
called Sjogren's is by far,

00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:39.540
the most common.

00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:43.330
The major symptoms of Sjogren's
are dry eyes or dry mouth.

00:29:43.330 --> 00:29:45.870
So if you have dry
eyes or dry mouth

00:29:45.870 --> 00:29:47.640
along with neuropathy
symptoms, it's

00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:49.660
something for you to consider.

00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:53.680
But even a lot of doctors
don't realize how common--

00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:56.950
polyneuropathy can be the
presenting symptom of Sjogren's

00:29:56.950 --> 00:29:59.020
in up to a quarter of patients.

00:29:59.020 --> 00:30:01.270
And a lot of the patients
with Sjogren's are

00:30:01.270 --> 00:30:04.000
what's called seronegative,
meaning their blood

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.370
test may not even show it.

00:30:06.370 --> 00:30:09.670
They're also very rare
immune neuropathies that

00:30:09.670 --> 00:30:11.980
are associated with cancer.

00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:14.620
But hey, in our
most recent paper,

00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:19.810
which studied 55 patients,
a quarter of them had known

00:30:19.810 --> 00:30:22.520
autoimmune diseases,
but 3/4 of them didn't.

00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:26.280
So what the heck
is going on here?

00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:30.540
Well, I think it's thrilling.

00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:32.570
I think it's thrilling
because I think we might

00:30:32.570 --> 00:30:35.570
be discovering a new disease.

00:30:35.570 --> 00:30:36.830
Maybe you guys can help.

00:30:36.830 --> 00:30:39.050
We really haven't found
a good name for this.

00:30:39.050 --> 00:30:41.660
So when we write our NIH
grants and our papers,

00:30:41.660 --> 00:30:45.060
we have to be very
conservative, and rightly so.

00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:46.940
And so what we're
calling this now

00:30:46.940 --> 00:30:52.340
is apparently autoimmune
small-fiber neuropathy.

00:30:52.340 --> 00:30:55.610
And see, I can't even say
immune because we're just

00:30:55.610 --> 00:30:57.950
starting to do the basic
science studies that

00:30:57.950 --> 00:30:59.280
are needed to prove this.

00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:01.520
So I'm calling it
apparently autoimmune,

00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:04.430
but this takes up a lot of
space when we write grants.

00:31:04.430 --> 00:31:06.710
So if anybody has a
better name, if you

00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:11.270
could come up to me afterwards,
and tell me your suggestions.

00:31:11.270 --> 00:31:14.210
And we're involved now in
a whole series of papers

00:31:14.210 --> 00:31:15.950
that we're publishing
with collaborators

00:31:15.950 --> 00:31:18.050
inside and outside of the lab.

00:31:18.050 --> 00:31:22.330
How about that
celiac paper, Maddy?

00:31:22.330 --> 00:31:23.860
You're going to do it, right?

00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:26.680
OK, I've got a commitment.

00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:31.330
Showing the overlap and
links between various types

00:31:31.330 --> 00:31:34.990
of autoimmune disease
and neuropathy.

00:31:34.990 --> 00:31:37.450
There are different kinds
of autoimmune diseases,

00:31:37.450 --> 00:31:42.910
and the evidence so far suggests
that auto antibodies may be--

00:31:42.910 --> 00:31:45.100
and B-cells, which
are made by B-cells,

00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:48.920
is probably more important
here for a bunch of reasons.

00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:52.090
You don't see a lot of cells
when you do spinal taps,

00:31:52.090 --> 00:31:54.790
or when you do biopsies
from these patients.

00:31:54.790 --> 00:31:58.570
And there also are detailed
blood test abnormalities,

00:31:58.570 --> 00:32:00.970
for instance, in the
complement pathway

00:32:00.970 --> 00:32:04.840
that are most consistent
with B-cell immune mediated

00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:06.070
dysfunction.

00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:09.430
Although, clearly when you
have longstanding cases,

00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:11.740
helper T-cells,
without any question,

00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:14.620
are involved in sustaining that.

00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:18.730
So putting this all together,
again, treatment is our focus.

00:32:18.730 --> 00:32:24.520
Our most recent paper reported
on the first ever study

00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:29.320
of immunotherapy for apparently
autoimmune small-fiber

00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:30.980
neuropathy.

00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:34.180
This is a retrospective study.

00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:36.460
Meaning it's a look
back at patients

00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:38.050
who were already treated.

00:32:38.050 --> 00:32:40.780
It's not the so-called
gold standard,

00:32:40.780 --> 00:32:44.960
the placebo controlled
randomized trial.

00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:46.870
The reason for that
is because those

00:32:46.870 --> 00:32:48.820
costs millions and
millions of dollars,

00:32:48.820 --> 00:32:51.760
and you've got to get
the money from NIH

00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:55.360
or other similar funding
agency, and the problem

00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:59.290
is they are not going to give
you the taxpayers' money to do

00:32:59.290 --> 00:33:02.260
this kind of study unless
there is some published

00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:04.720
evidence in the literature
that you're barking up

00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:06.820
the right tree, and
not the wrong tree.

00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:09.070
So we've now published
the paper that I

00:33:09.070 --> 00:33:11.020
think shows some
evidence that it

00:33:11.020 --> 00:33:13.900
might be reasonable to
consider these kinds of trials.

00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:18.100
This is what's called a proof
of concept research publication.

00:33:18.100 --> 00:33:22.070
This was done with my former
post-doctoral fellow, Doctor

00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:25.810
Liu, and we looked
back, again, at patients

00:33:25.810 --> 00:33:29.290
who had received a particular
treatment called IVIg, which

00:33:29.290 --> 00:33:31.360
is the best treatment
for other types

00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:33.940
of autoimmune neuropathies.

00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:36.880
So we had given it to
some of our patients here.

00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:39.160
We selected them
very rigorously.

00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:41.800
We do not want to give these
treatments to people who have

00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:43.510
other causes of neuropathy.

00:33:43.510 --> 00:33:46.270
That wouldn't work, and it would
be a lot of time, and effort,

00:33:46.270 --> 00:33:47.240
and wasted money.

00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:50.350
These are very expensive
treatments, I should mention.

00:33:50.350 --> 00:33:52.140
We tracked how patients did.

00:33:52.140 --> 00:33:55.450
The symptom important to a
lot of patients was pain.

00:33:55.450 --> 00:33:57.490
We tracked objective
measurements

00:33:57.490 --> 00:34:00.700
from AFT, autonomic
function testing.

00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:03.890
The difference in AFT
results is shown here.

00:34:03.890 --> 00:34:07.030
The blue are the
abnormal ATFT results

00:34:07.030 --> 00:34:08.770
before going on this treatment.

00:34:08.770 --> 00:34:10.380
The red is after.

00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:14.670
So 93% had abnormal results
before starting the treatment.

00:34:14.670 --> 00:34:19.540
54% had abnormal
results after treatment,

00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:23.770
and the adverse events
were pretty similar

00:34:23.770 --> 00:34:27.452
in other illnesses.

00:34:27.452 --> 00:34:31.510
So we're building on something
that we call a small fiber

00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:34.630
registry, and what a
registry is, is it's

00:34:34.630 --> 00:34:37.000
when you go to a
doc, and they really

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.489
try to track the information
they get from you,

00:34:39.489 --> 00:34:43.719
and they try to collect the
information in a standard way.

00:34:43.719 --> 00:34:46.810
And it's a heck of a lot
of effort to develop this.

00:34:46.810 --> 00:34:50.380
Again, it's not something
that is grant funded,

00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:52.750
but you kind of need it
in order to do research.

00:34:52.750 --> 00:34:55.294
And yeah, I'm looking at the
epidemiologists in the audience

00:34:55.294 --> 00:34:55.960
who would agree.

00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:58.870
Any other epidemiologists
here, by the way?

00:34:58.870 --> 00:35:01.300
Yeah, OK, so I've got
to just look at you two.

00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:04.240
And this just shows you some
of the types of information

00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:05.410
that we have.

00:35:05.410 --> 00:35:10.460
We're very interested and very
bullish on the blood samples,

00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:13.180
and if any of my patients are
here who've donated our blood,

00:35:13.180 --> 00:35:15.820
we're incredibly grateful
to you because this

00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:21.190
is a tremendous resource
for future research.

00:35:21.190 --> 00:35:24.280
This goes to show you some
of the kinds of experiments

00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:26.170
that we do with this blood.

00:35:26.170 --> 00:35:29.140
I think the most important
experiments, overall,

00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:31.180
are the ones that
involve something

00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:33.280
called passive transfer.

00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:36.130
And this is what's
used to really prove

00:35:36.130 --> 00:35:38.810
whether a disease is
autoimmune or not,

00:35:38.810 --> 00:35:42.610
and it involves taking a frozen
sample of that patient's blood.

00:35:42.610 --> 00:35:45.940
We're able to take extracts
of that patient's blood,

00:35:45.940 --> 00:35:48.460
and inject it into
little lab animals,

00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:52.510
and then see whether
those mice or rats develop

00:35:52.510 --> 00:35:54.490
symptoms of neuropathy.

00:35:54.490 --> 00:35:57.790
And if we do, that's something
that we can capture in our lab

00:35:57.790 --> 00:36:02.290
as well, and that provides
proof that in that patient,

00:36:02.290 --> 00:36:05.560
they have an autoimmune cause,
or something in their blood

00:36:05.560 --> 00:36:08.090
that's causing their neuropathy.

00:36:08.090 --> 00:36:10.300
This kind of research is
being done more and more

00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:14.110
in the cancer field, where
patient's own samples are used

00:36:14.110 --> 00:36:18.400
to create individual mice or
rats that then can be used

00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:21.220
to test the effects of
specific treatments,

00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:23.260
like specific chemotherapy--

00:36:23.260 --> 00:36:25.160
what's going to work
in that patient.

00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:27.850
So this is a very
powerful technique.

00:36:27.850 --> 00:36:29.980
And what you can
see here is the rat

00:36:29.980 --> 00:36:33.997
that was injected with
blood from the patient shown

00:36:33.997 --> 00:36:34.580
on the bottom.

00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:37.360
It's the serum from the
blood, not all the blood.

00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:39.600
Developed some
behavioral abnormalities,

00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:43.660
some signs of pain in the
paw of that particular rat.

00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:46.240
Whereas another
rat, shown in blue,

00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:48.460
maintained normal
sensory functions.

00:36:48.460 --> 00:36:50.860
So again, we're going
to see differences

00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:53.500
in the different animals,
depending on which

00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:56.620
patient serum was used.

00:36:56.620 --> 00:36:59.470
We're also developing
standardized exam forms,

00:36:59.470 --> 00:37:03.210
and that's a project in
particular of Shawn Downs--

00:37:03.210 --> 00:37:07.300
there you go-- with the
guidance of Gary Zirpoli,

00:37:07.300 --> 00:37:10.060
and this allows us
to figure out which

00:37:10.060 --> 00:37:15.250
aspects that become abnormal
are most useful for diagnosing

00:37:15.250 --> 00:37:16.240
neuropathy.

00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:18.100
And all these tests
I'm telling you about,

00:37:18.100 --> 00:37:21.190
all these fancy tests, is
wonderful for the people who

00:37:21.190 --> 00:37:23.110
can come and get
them, but we're well

00:37:23.110 --> 00:37:27.190
aware that 99.9% of
the people in the world

00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:30.340
can't come here to
Cambridge, and Boston,

00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:33.920
or similar universities to
have these kinds of tests.

00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:36.490
So what we're trying
to do is we ask

00:37:36.490 --> 00:37:41.260
the people who are coming
for these fancy shmancy tests

00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:45.190
to also see if they're
willing to let us take

00:37:45.190 --> 00:37:50.260
a few noninvasive simple tests,
and see how the results of that

00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:51.490
correlate.

00:37:51.490 --> 00:37:54.910
The idea is that if we can
develop simple, easy, cheap

00:37:54.910 --> 00:37:57.880
tests, and show that
they work almost as

00:37:57.880 --> 00:38:00.580
well as the
expensive tests, then

00:38:00.580 --> 00:38:03.550
they might be able to be
used all around the world.

00:38:03.550 --> 00:38:06.070
And with Max, who's
an engineer, and some

00:38:06.070 --> 00:38:10.060
of our other collaborators,
and Dr. Serrador from Rutgers,

00:38:10.060 --> 00:38:13.990
we're looking at the pupil
responses in the eye.

00:38:13.990 --> 00:38:16.930
The eye is a window
to the nervous system.

00:38:16.930 --> 00:38:19.030
Some people say the eyes
the window to the soul,

00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:21.790
but I prefer to think of
it as to the nervous system

00:38:21.790 --> 00:38:23.950
because those same
nerves control

00:38:23.950 --> 00:38:25.780
the functions of your eye.

00:38:25.780 --> 00:38:29.530
And so you can see this eye
from one of my young patients

00:38:29.530 --> 00:38:30.610
is very dilated.

00:38:30.610 --> 00:38:32.770
Her pupil is very dilated.

00:38:32.770 --> 00:38:35.560
With these pupil
metric goggles, what

00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:38.020
we're able to do in
our lab is to measure

00:38:38.020 --> 00:38:41.470
these pupillary
reflexes, record them,

00:38:41.470 --> 00:38:43.840
to test whether these
are useful things.

00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:46.150
If it turns out
to be useful, it's

00:38:46.150 --> 00:38:49.060
something that could
be very widely used.

00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:50.470
For instance,
perhaps, maybe it's

00:38:50.470 --> 00:38:53.560
something that could
be put on a cell phone.

00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:57.260
There aren't any biotech
entrepreneurs here, are there?

00:38:57.260 --> 00:38:59.190
Just checking.

00:38:59.190 --> 00:39:01.660
That's proprietary.

00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:07.800
So I'm going to wrap up by
stepping back, and bringing

00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:10.440
this up to think
well, I've told you

00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:12.540
about rare genetic diseases.

00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:15.300
I've told you about
common diseases, diabetes,

00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:18.690
a lot of different
causes of neuropathy.

00:39:18.690 --> 00:39:21.030
How big is this problem, anyway?

00:39:21.030 --> 00:39:22.590
Well, here's a clue.

00:39:22.590 --> 00:39:26.390
This is the epidemics
lecture series.

00:39:26.390 --> 00:39:29.070
So I've run some sort
of hand-waving thought

00:39:29.070 --> 00:39:29.760
experiments.

00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:31.020
No one knows the numbers.

00:39:31.020 --> 00:39:33.370
No one knows the
right answer here,

00:39:33.370 --> 00:39:35.670
but if you look back at
what's been published,

00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:38.160
there's really only
one epidemiologic study

00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:40.410
so far out of the Netherlands.

00:39:40.410 --> 00:39:42.990
And if you apply the numbers
they got to the world

00:39:42.990 --> 00:39:47.610
population, it suggests there
might be four million cases

00:39:47.610 --> 00:39:49.215
of small fiber in the world.

00:39:49.215 --> 00:39:51.600
The only problem with
that is for that study,

00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:56.160
you had to have a physician
verified objective diagnosis,

00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:58.830
and what I've been telling
you is that more than 90%

00:39:58.830 --> 00:40:01.110
of the people don't even
know they have this disease,

00:40:01.110 --> 00:40:03.600
and they've never even
seen a neurologist.

00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:07.560
So it may be that there's
closer to 40 million cases

00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:10.230
in the world than four million.

00:40:10.230 --> 00:40:13.020
But here's another way
you could look at it.

00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:15.300
Fibromyalgia effects
several percent

00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:17.220
of the world's population.

00:40:17.220 --> 00:40:20.130
Given that a dozen labs
are pretty much showing

00:40:20.130 --> 00:40:25.110
that maybe 40% of these may
have small fiber neuropathy,

00:40:25.110 --> 00:40:27.360
well, then that yields
the idea that there

00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:31.470
may be 75 million fibromyalgia
patients around the world who

00:40:31.470 --> 00:40:35.700
could have small fiber, but
not all small fiber patients

00:40:35.700 --> 00:40:38.230
have been diagnosed
with fibromyalgia.

00:40:38.230 --> 00:40:40.660
So when you go back, and
you factor the rest of them

00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:46.460
then, well, now you're
starting to look at numbers

00:40:46.460 --> 00:40:48.680
in the hundreds of millions.

00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:50.780
And again, I'm not
saying that that's

00:40:50.780 --> 00:40:51.980
how many people have this.

00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:53.300
We really don't know.

00:40:53.300 --> 00:40:55.640
The information
just isn't there.

00:40:55.640 --> 00:41:00.680
But whether it's 40 million,
four million, 400 million,

00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:02.780
either way, this told
us we need to start

00:41:02.780 --> 00:41:06.470
looking at this at the
population level, not only just

00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:10.100
with the individual patients
that make it into my office.

00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:12.680
And so for that reason,
we're collaborating

00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:14.750
with epidemiologists
at the Harvard

00:41:14.750 --> 00:41:16.610
School of Public Health.

00:41:16.610 --> 00:41:20.510
And Gary and I, with
our collaborators,

00:41:20.510 --> 00:41:25.220
are getting ready to publish the
first ever epidemiologic study.

00:41:25.220 --> 00:41:27.770
Now, this is all peripheral
neuropathy, not just

00:41:27.770 --> 00:41:29.720
small fiber neuropathy.

00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:32.450
In the US, and this is
through the Nurses' Health

00:41:32.450 --> 00:41:35.720
Study 2, which has
been tracking over

00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:39.690
100,000 nurses all across
the US for decades,

00:41:39.690 --> 00:41:42.190
and we have impeccable
information about their health

00:41:42.190 --> 00:41:44.940
care records, which
one has diabetes, which

00:41:44.940 --> 00:41:46.970
one was treated for
cancer, what drugs

00:41:46.970 --> 00:41:48.990
were used in many of them.

00:41:48.990 --> 00:41:52.670
And we've been able to pick
out more than 3,000 people who

00:41:52.670 --> 00:41:55.010
say, yeah, my doc
has told me that I've

00:41:55.010 --> 00:41:56.900
got peripheral neuropathy.

00:41:56.900 --> 00:42:00.080
So by going, and sending out
special additional surveys

00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:02.450
to them, we
anticipate that we're

00:42:02.450 --> 00:42:06.050
going to be able to learn more
about peripheral neuropathy

00:42:06.050 --> 00:42:09.260
than has ever been known
anywhere in the world.

00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:13.120
That's the power
of epidemiology.

00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:16.090
OK, so to allow
time for questions,

00:42:16.090 --> 00:42:18.340
I'm going to give you
a small summary first,

00:42:18.340 --> 00:42:21.190
and then we're going to move
into the question period.

00:42:21.190 --> 00:42:25.030
So I'm going to give you a
small summary of a big topic.

00:42:25.030 --> 00:42:28.360
That the symptoms of
small fiber neuropathy

00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:32.020
include pain and itch,
fatigue, [INAUDIBLE],,

00:42:32.020 --> 00:42:35.170
things that people don't
associate with neuropathy.

00:42:35.170 --> 00:42:38.260
I've told you what some of the
recommended diagnostic tests

00:42:38.260 --> 00:42:39.240
are.

00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:42.190
That blood tests are very
useful in identifying--

00:42:42.190 --> 00:42:45.100
not in everybody, but in
the majority of people,

00:42:45.100 --> 00:42:48.100
in providing hints as to
what the cause might be.

00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:50.830
Sometimes the tests need to
be repeated more than once,

00:42:50.830 --> 00:42:54.040
or some people may need
specialized genetic tests,

00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:57.550
or other special tests to
figure out what's going on.

00:42:57.550 --> 00:43:00.910
That there's strong evidence
from labs all around the world

00:43:00.910 --> 00:43:10.720
that patients who have,
whether it's CME, CFS, Gulf War

00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:15.310
Illness, chronic Lyme, that
a substantial proportion--

00:43:15.310 --> 00:43:18.610
somewhere between a third to
a half of people who receive

00:43:18.610 --> 00:43:22.630
these labels may in fact,
have an actual underlying,

00:43:22.630 --> 00:43:25.490
potentially treatable
medical disease.

00:43:25.490 --> 00:43:28.540
So that's maybe the single
most important message,

00:43:28.540 --> 00:43:30.460
is to take this information out.

00:43:30.460 --> 00:43:33.280
Every one of us, I think,
has family members or friends

00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:35.410
who are suffering
from these illnesses.

00:43:35.410 --> 00:43:37.090
It's really important
that they know

00:43:37.090 --> 00:43:40.630
that they can ask their doctor
have we thought about this?

00:43:40.630 --> 00:43:44.540
Would it be reasonable to think
about testing me for this?

00:43:44.540 --> 00:43:47.630
Some of the patients with
this type of neuropathy

00:43:47.630 --> 00:43:51.110
probably have immune
causes, and in them,

00:43:51.110 --> 00:43:53.780
the treatments for other
immune neuropathies

00:43:53.780 --> 00:43:59.060
are quite reasonably safe,
and appear to be effective.

00:43:59.060 --> 00:44:00.620
We don't know the
numbers of people

00:44:00.620 --> 00:44:02.930
who have this around the
world, but either way, it's

00:44:02.930 --> 00:44:03.920
a heck of a lot.

00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:06.140
Either way it's too many.

00:44:06.140 --> 00:44:10.010
And my point is is let's
step away from this whole

00:44:10.010 --> 00:44:14.460
opioid crisis business, and
giving people painkillers.

00:44:14.460 --> 00:44:16.910
I've got nothing
against painkillers,

00:44:16.910 --> 00:44:19.470
but we're so much
smarter than that now,

00:44:19.470 --> 00:44:21.170
and we can find
better treatments.

00:44:21.170 --> 00:44:25.970
Treatments that actually fight
back at the disease, not just

00:44:25.970 --> 00:44:28.040
masking the pain
that you have to take

00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:30.020
for decade after decade.

00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:34.700
So let's move onto the era
of smart medicine treatment.

00:44:34.700 --> 00:44:37.670
And I'd like to extend
my thanks to Radcliffe

00:44:37.670 --> 00:44:41.540
for this wonderful opportunity,
this auditorium, the publicity.

00:44:41.540 --> 00:44:44.600
By the way, the cookies
downstairs are fabulous.

00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:46.700
So thank you for the cookies.

00:44:46.700 --> 00:44:50.360
I especially like to thank my
patients because again, what

00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:53.750
I'm telling you is not
stuff that's in textbooks.

00:44:53.750 --> 00:44:55.670
We're writing the
textbooks, and we're

00:44:55.670 --> 00:44:58.010
writing the textbooks
because of what we've

00:44:58.010 --> 00:44:59.940
learned from our patients.

00:44:59.940 --> 00:45:02.420
So all of those people who've
let me ask them questions,

00:45:02.420 --> 00:45:05.660
who've spent more than an hour
in my office talking to me,

00:45:05.660 --> 00:45:07.080
thank you so much.

00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:09.260
Thank you to the members
of our research team,

00:45:09.260 --> 00:45:10.700
past and present.

00:45:10.700 --> 00:45:13.460
I'm presenting the work
of dozens and dozens

00:45:13.460 --> 00:45:15.020
of collaborators.

00:45:15.020 --> 00:45:18.290
And thank you also to our
funders, both the National

00:45:18.290 --> 00:45:21.050
Institutes of Health, the
Department of Defense.

00:45:21.050 --> 00:45:24.230
We have several people
in private foundations

00:45:24.230 --> 00:45:27.020
who have made substantial
donations to our group, which

00:45:27.020 --> 00:45:32.440
is very important, something we
can put directly to good use.

00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:35.770
And I'll end by mentioning that
a lot of the information I have

00:45:35.770 --> 00:45:39.810
told you is available on our
website, our Neuropathy Commons

00:45:39.810 --> 00:45:42.260
website.

00:45:42.260 --> 00:45:43.830
My phone is telling
me something,

00:45:43.830 --> 00:45:45.660
probably that it's time to end.

00:45:45.660 --> 00:45:47.280
Thank you, again,
for your attention.

00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:49.680
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:58.340 --> 00:46:00.110
- All right, so we
have some roving mics.

00:46:00.110 --> 00:46:02.690
So go ahead, and-- oh,
lots of questions already.

00:46:02.690 --> 00:46:03.190
Great.

00:46:05.911 --> 00:46:06.910
I'll leave it up to you.

00:46:11.020 --> 00:46:14.280
- So why don't we start in the
back of the room for a change.

00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:16.885
Who's farthest back?

00:46:16.885 --> 00:46:19.650
Is that you?

00:46:19.650 --> 00:46:21.290
- Thank you.

00:46:21.290 --> 00:46:23.400
So in the beginning
of the talk, you

00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:26.850
mentioned that GI
symptoms were frequently

00:46:26.850 --> 00:46:29.539
a symptom of
peripheral neuropathy,

00:46:29.539 --> 00:46:31.080
and then at the end
of the talk, when

00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:32.550
you were talking
about autoimmune,

00:46:32.550 --> 00:46:37.170
you mentioned something like
celiac related neuropathy.

00:46:37.170 --> 00:46:42.240
So I'm wondering, how do we
know that the GI symptoms are

00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:45.330
a result of the neuropathy,
as opposed to the neuropathy

00:46:45.330 --> 00:46:48.300
being a result of a GI problem.

00:46:48.300 --> 00:46:49.620
- Great question.

00:46:49.620 --> 00:46:53.820
I mentioned celiac because
it's autoimmune, but only

00:46:53.820 --> 00:46:54.930
a minority.

00:46:54.930 --> 00:46:58.500
Only a few patients
actually have celiac.

00:46:58.500 --> 00:47:02.220
We test for it routinely
because so many of these people

00:47:02.220 --> 00:47:05.130
have GI symptoms, and because
people can have celiac,

00:47:05.130 --> 00:47:07.390
and have no GI symptoms.

00:47:07.390 --> 00:47:09.420
But it's only a very rare cause.

00:47:09.420 --> 00:47:12.510
Maddie, here, is going to
write the paper with me that

00:47:12.510 --> 00:47:15.750
will define how common it is.

00:47:15.750 --> 00:47:17.210
It's pretty rare as a cause.

00:47:22.540 --> 00:47:24.330
From the back with
the pink shirt.

00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:34.050
- Is there any relationship
between the mechanism

00:47:34.050 --> 00:47:39.095
of the post-herpetic herpes
pain, and the small fiber?

00:47:42.090 --> 00:47:44.850
- That's not a
plant, by the way.

00:47:44.850 --> 00:47:45.810
Absolutely.

00:47:45.810 --> 00:47:49.080
And so I actually started
my research career

00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:52.080
at Johns Hopkins where I
trained, and my first research

00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:55.650
grant was on
post-herpetic neuralgia.

00:47:55.650 --> 00:47:59.250
And our lab showed that
post-herpetic neuralgia

00:47:59.250 --> 00:48:04.050
is associated with severe
damage to these same small fiber

00:48:04.050 --> 00:48:06.690
neurons because again,
they're the neurons that

00:48:06.690 --> 00:48:08.700
transmit pain signals.

00:48:08.700 --> 00:48:12.780
And shingles or
zoster, specifically

00:48:12.780 --> 00:48:15.610
damages sensory neurons.

00:48:15.610 --> 00:48:18.360
And so yes, we view
post-herpetic neuralgia,

00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:22.950
and also post-herpetic itch,
which my group put on the map,

00:48:22.950 --> 00:48:25.980
as kind of a restricted
form of these same--

00:48:25.980 --> 00:48:29.070
I'm pointing here because this
is the most common location

00:48:29.070 --> 00:48:30.930
where people get shingles--

00:48:30.930 --> 00:48:34.050
as a restricted form of
a small fiber neuropathy.

00:48:34.050 --> 00:48:37.540
And by the way, in
case you haven't heard,

00:48:37.540 --> 00:48:40.920
there's a very effective
new shingles vaccine

00:48:40.920 --> 00:48:43.440
that's going to be
coming to the market

00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:46.550
within the next few months, and
it's dramatically effective,

00:48:46.550 --> 00:48:47.640
even in older people.

00:48:47.640 --> 00:48:50.220
Not that that's any
of us here, but if you

00:48:50.220 --> 00:48:53.610
know anybody who hasn't been
vaccinated against shingles,

00:48:53.610 --> 00:48:54.480
now's the time.

00:48:57.146 --> 00:48:57.729
I'll let you--

00:49:00.330 --> 00:49:02.985
I'm not very good at picking,
so I'll let you do the picking,

00:49:02.985 --> 00:49:04.860
and I think there's time
for everybody to get

00:49:04.860 --> 00:49:06.810
their questions answered.

00:49:06.810 --> 00:49:08.640
- Hi, thanks for your talk.

00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:10.290
I was wondering if
you had any thoughts

00:49:10.290 --> 00:49:13.170
on chronic regional
pain syndrome being

00:49:13.170 --> 00:49:17.160
a diagnosis related to
small fiber neuropathy,

00:49:17.160 --> 00:49:21.660
and one more, any thoughts
on amino acid peptides?

00:49:21.660 --> 00:49:24.797
And my friend next to
me has questions too.

00:49:24.797 --> 00:49:26.130
- What was your second question?

00:49:26.130 --> 00:49:30.960
- My second question was about
a treatment being peptides--

00:49:30.960 --> 00:49:32.103
amino acid peptides.

00:49:32.103 --> 00:49:34.284
No?

00:49:34.284 --> 00:49:34.950
- That's simple.

00:49:34.950 --> 00:49:38.430
No, I don't know about amino
acids peptides as a treatment.

00:49:38.430 --> 00:49:43.080
- And the first one
was CRPS for RSD.

00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:45.590
- After we wrote
papers on shingles,

00:49:45.590 --> 00:49:49.000
and we turned our attention to
complex regional pain syndrome,

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:51.030
which has a lot of
similar symptoms--

00:49:51.030 --> 00:49:56.790
the unexplained pain, swelling,
color changes, changes in hair,

00:49:56.790 --> 00:50:00.480
and we published the first
objective evidence that that is

00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:04.170
what we call a regional
small fiber neuropathy,

00:50:04.170 --> 00:50:07.860
where only a part of the
body's nerves are affected.

00:50:07.860 --> 00:50:10.450
I've been telling you
about polyneuropathy,

00:50:10.450 --> 00:50:13.200
which means it's a
generalized nerve problem.

00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:16.680
So yes, we think CRPS
is very closely linked,

00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:19.380
and that it's a regional
small fiber neuropathy.

00:50:19.380 --> 00:50:21.960
And furthermore,
CRPS, which is when

00:50:21.960 --> 00:50:25.890
people have a kind of an
injury, a skiing accident,

00:50:25.890 --> 00:50:27.930
or cut their leg, or a sprain.

00:50:27.930 --> 00:50:30.240
It's something that
would just get better,

00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:32.520
and for whatever reason,
it just doesn't get better,

00:50:32.520 --> 00:50:36.374
and the pain, and problems
can go on for years sometimes.

00:50:36.374 --> 00:50:38.040
We think that in some
of those patients,

00:50:38.040 --> 00:50:41.700
they may actually have
an underlying small fiber

00:50:41.700 --> 00:50:44.370
polyneuropathy, and
it's for that reason

00:50:44.370 --> 00:50:47.040
that their nerves
aren't able to recover

00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:49.114
after they've been injured.

00:50:49.114 --> 00:50:52.100
- Thank you.

00:50:52.100 --> 00:50:53.240
- Yes, I had a question.

00:50:53.240 --> 00:50:56.610
It was a really great lecture,
and it's very informative.

00:50:56.610 --> 00:51:01.220
So in terms of the skin biopsy
that you do in patients,

00:51:01.220 --> 00:51:03.800
have you had any sort
of insight in terms

00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:06.770
of if it's done once on a
patient in the beginning

00:51:06.770 --> 00:51:09.050
of their symptoms, and their
symptoms are progressing,

00:51:09.050 --> 00:51:12.770
and the initial biopsy is
not showing anything, what

00:51:12.770 --> 00:51:15.560
is your protocol, and what
happens to patients who are

00:51:15.560 --> 00:51:17.150
progressively getting worse?

00:51:17.150 --> 00:51:19.364
Would you repeat it soon?

00:51:19.364 --> 00:51:20.780
How do you observe
those patients.

00:51:20.780 --> 00:51:23.540
And the second question was
about when we mentioned--

00:51:23.540 --> 00:51:24.665
- Wait, the first question.

00:51:24.665 --> 00:51:25.970
- Oh, sorry.

00:51:25.970 --> 00:51:28.290
- Let me just answer the
first question first.

00:51:28.290 --> 00:51:30.500
So the question is
about skin biopsies,

00:51:30.500 --> 00:51:34.820
and that's currently
the best test available,

00:51:34.820 --> 00:51:36.390
but it's far from perfect.

00:51:36.390 --> 00:51:40.280
There's no medical test
that's 100% perfect.

00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:42.530
And so what I would
say if the skin biopsy

00:51:42.530 --> 00:51:45.500
shows that you have
severe nerve damage,

00:51:45.500 --> 00:51:48.770
then it's highly
likely that you do

00:51:48.770 --> 00:51:50.270
have this kind of neuropathy.

00:51:50.270 --> 00:51:53.150
That's called positive
predictive value.

00:51:53.150 --> 00:51:55.730
But on the other hand, it
doesn't always pick it up.

00:51:55.730 --> 00:51:58.700
As you say, what if the biopsy
is done early in the course?

00:51:58.700 --> 00:52:01.620
Or what if it's taken from
the wrong part of the body?

00:52:01.620 --> 00:52:04.430
So the fact that you
have a normal skin biopsy

00:52:04.430 --> 00:52:07.280
doesn't mean you don't have
this kind of neuropathy.

00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:09.560
It makes it less likely.

00:52:09.560 --> 00:52:11.930
And some patients I've
been following for years,

00:52:11.930 --> 00:52:14.780
their skin biopsies were
normal at the beginning,

00:52:14.780 --> 00:52:16.910
we would suggest they
might want to repeat it

00:52:16.910 --> 00:52:20.900
a few years later if we still
didn't know what was going on.

00:52:20.900 --> 00:52:24.110
And in some of them, it's
dropped over the years.

00:52:24.110 --> 00:52:25.890
It might still be
in the normal range,

00:52:25.890 --> 00:52:29.300
but it might have started out
at the 70 or 80th percentile,

00:52:29.300 --> 00:52:32.600
and it's dropped 60, 40, 20.

00:52:32.600 --> 00:52:37.490
So that tells us their nerves
are going, or not healthy,

00:52:37.490 --> 00:52:39.980
or it drops into
the abnormal range.

00:52:39.980 --> 00:52:45.490
So they're not perfect, but
it's still very important.

00:52:45.490 --> 00:52:47.335
It's a very important,
very useful test.

00:52:47.335 --> 00:52:48.751
And what was your
second question?

00:52:48.751 --> 00:52:51.310
The second question
is about Sjogren's.

00:52:51.310 --> 00:52:54.280
You mentioned that a lot of
patients are seronegative.

00:52:54.280 --> 00:52:56.800
How do you correlate
patients who

00:52:56.800 --> 00:53:01.150
might have the autonomic testing
showing positive, and the sweat

00:53:01.150 --> 00:53:03.760
testing, but then
they're seronegative?

00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:04.750
What is the next steps?

00:53:04.750 --> 00:53:09.030
And they do have--
they're very symptomatic.

00:53:09.030 --> 00:53:11.640
- That's kind of a complicated
question because the sweat

00:53:11.640 --> 00:53:15.690
testing isn't the recommended
test for diagnosing Sjogren's.

00:53:15.690 --> 00:53:19.230
So Sjogren's requires a
rheumatology evaluation

00:53:19.230 --> 00:53:21.790
by somebody who's
really familiar with it.

00:53:21.790 --> 00:53:24.510
They factor in a lot of
things-- the symptoms you have,

00:53:24.510 --> 00:53:28.060
looking in the eyes, their
formal diagnostic criteria.

00:53:28.060 --> 00:53:30.330
Sometimes they take
a biopsy from the lip

00:53:30.330 --> 00:53:32.370
to look at the
salivary glands, and it

00:53:32.370 --> 00:53:36.820
can take a few years to work
out a Sjogren's diagnosis.

00:53:36.820 --> 00:53:39.660
Shall we work our way towards
some of the patient people?

00:53:39.660 --> 00:53:41.190
We can come back
to the back, but I

00:53:41.190 --> 00:53:45.150
want to also get some equal
representation from the front.

00:53:45.150 --> 00:53:49.160
- Hi, I'm a patient, and I
just want to understand better

00:53:49.160 --> 00:53:50.160
the impact on the brain.

00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:52.421
- Could you raise
your hand again?

00:53:52.421 --> 00:53:52.920
Oh, great.

00:53:52.920 --> 00:53:53.940
Thank you, OK.

00:53:53.940 --> 00:53:56.670
- I'd like to understand
better the impacts

00:53:56.670 --> 00:53:58.090
on the brain both ways.

00:53:58.090 --> 00:54:00.420
One of your slides
mentioned polypharmacy

00:54:00.420 --> 00:54:02.254
as a potential cause.

00:54:02.254 --> 00:54:04.170
So I don't know if that's
too many medications

00:54:04.170 --> 00:54:05.160
impacting the brain.

00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:09.660
And then also, could occipital
neuralgia be a headache caused

00:54:09.660 --> 00:54:12.730
by small fiber neuropathy?

00:54:12.730 --> 00:54:14.780
- That's a whole complex topic.

00:54:14.780 --> 00:54:16.420
I don't know if any one--

00:54:16.420 --> 00:54:20.170
I'm a neuroscientist, and I'm
in the neurology department.

00:54:20.170 --> 00:54:23.280
I'm surrounded by experts
on cognitive function,

00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:25.060
by experts on
headache, and I don't

00:54:25.060 --> 00:54:27.190
know of any of them that's
looking at small fiber

00:54:27.190 --> 00:54:28.660
neuropathy yet.

00:54:28.660 --> 00:54:30.250
So another one of my goals--

00:54:30.250 --> 00:54:33.220
I hope I have some colleagues,
and fellow researchers

00:54:33.220 --> 00:54:34.580
in the audience.

00:54:34.580 --> 00:54:36.250
Another reason to
give this talk is

00:54:36.250 --> 00:54:38.920
to excite people who are
working in different areas

00:54:38.920 --> 00:54:41.530
to start taking up
their own projects.

00:54:41.530 --> 00:54:45.560
We'd be thrilled to have
experts start to look at this.

00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:48.670
What I tried to summarize
in that complicated slide

00:54:48.670 --> 00:54:52.930
is that peripheral neuropathy,
specifically small fiber,

00:54:52.930 --> 00:54:56.690
can affect the brain in
a lot of different ways.

00:54:56.690 --> 00:54:59.740
For one thing, those cells, we
think of them as peripheral,

00:54:59.740 --> 00:55:02.470
but they actually send
part of their cell up

00:55:02.470 --> 00:55:04.100
into the spinal cord.

00:55:04.100 --> 00:55:06.820
So it's part of the central
nervous system, as well as

00:55:06.820 --> 00:55:10.310
the peripheral nervous system.

00:55:10.310 --> 00:55:14.230
Even the ones that don't send
an axon up the spinal cord,

00:55:14.230 --> 00:55:17.390
but that end where they
come into the spinal cord,

00:55:17.390 --> 00:55:18.610
they synapse.

00:55:18.610 --> 00:55:20.510
They connect with
other nerve cells.

00:55:20.510 --> 00:55:23.170
So there are
tran-synaptic effects.

00:55:23.170 --> 00:55:24.850
And then there are
network effects

00:55:24.850 --> 00:55:28.360
in the brain when the brain
cells change their function,

00:55:28.360 --> 00:55:32.050
for instance, because of
reduced sensory input coming in.

00:55:32.050 --> 00:55:33.970
And then what you
mentioned is what

00:55:33.970 --> 00:55:37.840
I call the downward spiral,
which was when people are sick,

00:55:37.840 --> 00:55:39.340
and they don't know
what's going on,

00:55:39.340 --> 00:55:41.350
and they're doing
all this stuff,

00:55:41.350 --> 00:55:44.110
and they get on medication
for this for their stomach,

00:55:44.110 --> 00:55:46.570
for their pain, they
become depressed,

00:55:46.570 --> 00:55:48.730
they become inactive.

00:55:48.730 --> 00:55:51.620
All of these things have
effects on the brain as well,

00:55:51.620 --> 00:55:55.030
and so those really are
tertiary and quaternary

00:55:55.030 --> 00:55:57.190
effects of being so sick.

00:55:57.190 --> 00:56:00.703
So it affects the brain at
a lot of different levels.

00:56:00.703 --> 00:56:01.669
- Thank you.

00:56:10.380 --> 00:56:15.660
- Hi, I was asking about
ESR because you used that

00:56:15.660 --> 00:56:19.710
as one of your
tests, and I've heard

00:56:19.710 --> 00:56:22.230
that it's kind of unreliable,
and I was wondering

00:56:22.230 --> 00:56:24.060
what sort of ranges
you're looking at,

00:56:24.060 --> 00:56:28.490
and why you chose that test.

00:56:28.490 --> 00:56:33.380
- We actually don't rely on
any one test of autoimmunity.

00:56:33.380 --> 00:56:36.860
It's not a black or a
white situation for exactly

00:56:36.860 --> 00:56:39.440
the reason that you
point out, which

00:56:39.440 --> 00:56:44.010
is that these tests that are
used to track immune function,

00:56:44.010 --> 00:56:48.380
I wouldn't call them unreliable,
but I'd call them nonspecific.

00:56:48.380 --> 00:56:51.170
And so that means they
don't correlate that well.

00:56:51.170 --> 00:56:53.240
Somebody could have
an autoimmune disease,

00:56:53.240 --> 00:56:54.920
and have a normal blood test.

00:56:54.920 --> 00:56:58.040
A certain number of people have
abnormal blood test results,

00:56:58.040 --> 00:57:00.660
and they don't have
autoimmune diseases.

00:57:00.660 --> 00:57:03.110
So they're statistically
associated,

00:57:03.110 --> 00:57:05.690
but it's not a black
or white relationship,

00:57:05.690 --> 00:57:08.960
and that's why I mentioned
these things like--

00:57:08.960 --> 00:57:10.870
I don't remember
the exact percent

00:57:10.870 --> 00:57:14.910
have abnormal ESR, which stands
for erythrocyte sedimentation

00:57:14.910 --> 00:57:15.410
rate.

00:57:15.410 --> 00:57:17.930
Others may have
a low complement.

00:57:17.930 --> 00:57:22.340
Others may have a test called
ANA, anti-nuclear antibodies.

00:57:22.340 --> 00:57:25.850
And again, none of these are
specific for small fiber,

00:57:25.850 --> 00:57:28.220
or any particular
disease at all,

00:57:28.220 --> 00:57:32.630
but together, they kind
of give a hint, a clue,

00:57:32.630 --> 00:57:36.500
when they're elevated in such
a high percentage of patients

00:57:36.500 --> 00:57:38.690
that there may be a
link to an autoimmunity.

00:57:38.690 --> 00:57:40.116
Not in each person.

00:57:49.540 --> 00:57:52.330
- Hi, thank you for the talk.

00:57:52.330 --> 00:57:56.770
I wanted to ask-- you mentioned
CFS or chronic fatigue,

00:57:56.770 --> 00:58:01.030
and it's one of these
idiopathic things that

00:58:01.030 --> 00:58:05.140
might have small fiber
neuropathy as the underlying

00:58:05.140 --> 00:58:06.130
cause.

00:58:06.130 --> 00:58:11.280
What sort of work has your
group or others done on that?

00:58:11.280 --> 00:58:14.470
- My collaboration with
David Systrom and his team

00:58:14.470 --> 00:58:15.970
at the Brigham,
I think, is going

00:58:15.970 --> 00:58:19.330
to publish some really exciting
data coming out of that,

00:58:19.330 --> 00:58:21.130
and I think it's OK
for me to mention it

00:58:21.130 --> 00:58:26.160
since we've already published
it in preliminary abstract form.

00:58:26.160 --> 00:58:33.850
And what that's going to show
is that a substantial percent

00:58:33.850 --> 00:58:35.680
of people who present--

00:58:35.680 --> 00:58:36.970
he's not a neurologist.

00:58:36.970 --> 00:58:38.360
He's not a nerve doc.

00:58:38.360 --> 00:58:41.980
He's a lung and circulation doc.

00:58:41.980 --> 00:58:46.060
People who go to him because of
this lack of energy, and just

00:58:46.060 --> 00:58:48.730
difficulty getting out
of bed, and inability

00:58:48.730 --> 00:58:52.550
to do their routine, a
substantial percent of them do,

00:58:52.550 --> 00:58:55.180
in fact, have this kind
of peripheral neuropathy.

00:58:55.180 --> 00:58:59.110
So not everybody, but enough
that a doctor should always

00:58:59.110 --> 00:59:03.380
think about it as part of
their differential diagnosis.

00:59:03.380 --> 00:59:04.640
And it's treatable.

00:59:04.640 --> 00:59:06.822
Once you know-- there
are many reasons not

00:59:06.822 --> 00:59:08.030
to be able to get out of bed.

00:59:08.030 --> 00:59:10.800
Depression, for instance,
is a very common one.

00:59:10.800 --> 00:59:14.790
So it's important to go beyond
the I have chronic fatigue,

00:59:14.790 --> 00:59:17.180
to let me go see a
doctor like Systrom who

00:59:17.180 --> 00:59:20.960
can do the tests to
actually measure my blood

00:59:20.960 --> 00:59:23.030
flow, and my heart
rate, and my blood

00:59:23.030 --> 00:59:25.490
pressure under
different circumstances,

00:59:25.490 --> 00:59:28.730
and hone in on what's
the exact cause in me

00:59:28.730 --> 00:59:30.626
because he's got
effective treatments.

00:59:39.600 --> 00:59:43.080
- So I wanted to ask more
broadly, we have about half

00:59:43.080 --> 00:59:46.152
of patients with POTS, and
chronic fatigue syndrome,

00:59:46.152 --> 00:59:46.860
and fibromyalgia.

00:59:46.860 --> 00:59:51.180
The syndromic disorders
have a tangible small fiber

00:59:51.180 --> 00:59:55.530
neuropathy, and you're
looking at the immunotherapy

00:59:55.530 --> 00:59:56.630
in these patients.

00:59:56.630 --> 00:59:57.270
Has anybody--

00:59:57.270 --> 00:59:58.020
- In some of them.

00:59:58.020 --> 00:59:59.580
- In some of these
patients, right.

00:59:59.580 --> 01:00:03.690
Has anybody looked for
functional receptor antibodies

01:00:03.690 --> 01:00:05.280
that maybe don't
cause a neuropathy,

01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:08.130
or haven't yet, at whatever
stage in the illness,

01:00:08.130 --> 01:00:12.300
doing like the passive transfer
work to rabbits or something,

01:00:12.300 --> 01:00:15.030
with serum from patients who
don't have the neuropathy

01:00:15.030 --> 01:00:17.340
to see if the immunological
profile you're finding

01:00:17.340 --> 01:00:19.770
might be in those patients too?

01:00:19.770 --> 01:00:23.160
- Yeah, we would always
use controlled sera,

01:00:23.160 --> 01:00:27.030
and so it's very important to
thank not only the patients who

01:00:27.030 --> 01:00:30.480
come for research, but
also the normal controls,

01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:34.920
and people with other diseases
because all of the work we do,

01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:38.520
we have to compare what we
find from patients to what we

01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:41.020
find in the general population.

01:00:41.020 --> 01:00:47.382
And so yes, we would always
use serum from non-patients

01:00:47.382 --> 01:00:49.090
to do these kinds of
experiments as well.

01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:02.800
- I had two observations
I'd like to share.

01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:09.850
It seems that the cause of
this problem is in the plasma,

01:01:09.850 --> 01:01:14.465
and that it's an
immunecomplex problem.

01:01:14.465 --> 01:01:19.360
There are immune antibodies
that are in the plasma.

01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:24.760
Has plasmapheresis been
considered as a treatment

01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:30.400
to remove the offending plasma,
and replace it with colloid,

01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:31.955
or clean plasma.

01:01:34.650 --> 01:01:39.230
Instead of infusing
immunoglobulin G

01:01:39.230 --> 01:01:42.920
to down regulate the
production of auto antibodies,

01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:46.580
perhaps plasmapheresis could
remove the offending agent.

01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:52.140
That's one observation.

01:01:52.140 --> 01:01:54.230
The other observation
I had was that--

01:01:54.230 --> 01:02:00.550
or question-- there's talk
about genetic involvement.

01:02:00.550 --> 01:02:07.420
Has consideration been given
to the abnormal gene sequences

01:02:07.420 --> 01:02:12.900
being viral inserts,
and not inherited

01:02:12.900 --> 01:02:15.680
from a prior infection?

01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:20.780
DNA from a particular
virus, enterovirus perhaps.

01:02:20.780 --> 01:02:25.940
So if it lies in the
genes, in that sense,

01:02:25.940 --> 01:02:30.110
that would account for the
chronicity of the illness,

01:02:30.110 --> 01:02:33.140
and that would account
for the remissions,

01:02:33.140 --> 01:02:38.740
and then the relapses
because the genes are still

01:02:38.740 --> 01:02:42.150
there expressing themselves.

01:02:42.150 --> 01:02:45.880
So I'm wondering-- I guess the
point is has consideration been

01:02:45.880 --> 01:02:49.820
given to the fact that
these might be gene inserts,

01:02:49.820 --> 01:02:52.110
not mutations, and
not inherited--

01:02:52.110 --> 01:02:53.370
- Great question.

01:02:53.370 --> 01:02:54.310
Great question.

01:02:54.310 --> 01:02:57.930
So actually, a couple of
questions and comments, and one

01:02:57.930 --> 01:03:00.630
is about other types
of immunotherapy.

01:03:00.630 --> 01:03:03.100
And again, immunotherapy
is only one treatment,

01:03:03.100 --> 01:03:07.560
and it's a treatment for
those people who it turns out

01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:10.710
we think have an autoimmune
cause, which is really not

01:03:10.710 --> 01:03:12.600
everybody.

01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:17.370
But for immunotherapy, you
have to think and individualize

01:03:17.370 --> 01:03:19.290
the treatment for the
different patients,

01:03:19.290 --> 01:03:21.750
and there are different
immunotherapies.

01:03:21.750 --> 01:03:24.100
There's no one size fits all.

01:03:24.100 --> 01:03:25.770
And so yes, absolutely.

01:03:25.770 --> 01:03:30.300
I do have some patients
who use plasma exchange.

01:03:30.300 --> 01:03:33.370
Taking out their own
blood-- it's like dialysis.

01:03:33.370 --> 01:03:36.990
It dialyzes away
their autoantibodies.

01:03:36.990 --> 01:03:39.750
But again, another
expensive therapy that's

01:03:39.750 --> 01:03:41.370
very hard to get approval for.

01:03:41.370 --> 01:03:44.190
It's got its own
problems, and so it's not

01:03:44.190 --> 01:03:46.410
something that is routine.

01:03:46.410 --> 01:03:51.700
We try to start with the
simpler, more mainstream

01:03:51.700 --> 01:03:52.590
immunotherapies.

01:03:52.590 --> 01:03:54.870
There's a whole host
of new immunotherapies

01:03:54.870 --> 01:03:56.610
that are coming to market.

01:03:56.610 --> 01:03:58.950
Eculizumab, for instance,
is newly approved

01:03:58.950 --> 01:04:01.350
for a neurologic
autoimmune indication.

01:04:01.350 --> 01:04:03.780
So it's really exciting
days, and that's

01:04:03.780 --> 01:04:08.220
why it's so important that basic
scientists get involved in this

01:04:08.220 --> 01:04:10.290
so that we can
actually figure out

01:04:10.290 --> 01:04:13.260
what the molecular
epitopes are, what

01:04:13.260 --> 01:04:17.100
the targets are of antibodies
because when we really

01:04:17.100 --> 01:04:20.010
know what's going on at
the molecular level, then

01:04:20.010 --> 01:04:22.830
we can use much more
targeted therapies.

01:04:22.830 --> 01:04:27.090
As you say, IVIg is kind of
a dirty drug that is a very

01:04:27.090 --> 01:04:28.590
crude way of approaching it.

01:04:28.590 --> 01:04:30.870
It's the best
treatment we have now,

01:04:30.870 --> 01:04:34.080
but I think as this
comes into sharper focus,

01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:38.520
and as other research teams
get involved beyond my own,

01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:41.460
it's going to open the door
to much better therapies.

01:04:41.460 --> 01:04:44.250
With regard to the genes,
the genes are involved.

01:04:44.250 --> 01:04:46.200
Without any question,
genes are involved

01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:47.460
in autoimmune diseases.

01:04:47.460 --> 01:04:50.370
We're interested in
looking at the HLA antigen.

01:04:50.370 --> 01:04:53.490
Some people have just
unknown genetic mutations.

01:04:53.490 --> 01:04:58.770
I was at NIH last week working
on a family with a novel very

01:04:58.770 --> 01:05:01.560
clear familial genetic
cause that's never been

01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:03.180
described in the literature.

01:05:03.180 --> 01:05:06.530
So by doing detailed
mapping of the genes

01:05:06.530 --> 01:05:08.550
from that family, the
affected individuals,

01:05:08.550 --> 01:05:10.500
the unaffected
individuals, we're

01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:14.160
likely going to discover a new
gene that causes neuropathy.

01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:16.950
But even in people who don't
have familial neuropathies,

01:05:16.950 --> 01:05:20.400
we know that tendencies
are genetically inherited.

01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:22.770
And so when we can
get our database up

01:05:22.770 --> 01:05:25.290
to the level of
tens of thousands

01:05:25.290 --> 01:05:28.170
of samples, right Gary?

01:05:28.170 --> 01:05:29.850
At that point,
then you can really

01:05:29.850 --> 01:05:36.782
start doing population genetics,
epigenetics, and much more

01:05:36.782 --> 01:05:37.740
sophisticated genetics.

01:05:41.940 --> 01:05:42.900
- Hi.

01:05:42.900 --> 01:05:44.560
Thank you so much for your talk.

01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:46.090
I have two questions for you.

01:05:46.090 --> 01:05:47.250
- Was it thrilling?

01:05:47.250 --> 01:05:49.140
- I said thank you so
much for your talk.

01:05:49.140 --> 01:05:50.517
Yes, it was thrilling.

01:05:50.517 --> 01:05:51.860
- Thank you.

01:05:51.860 --> 01:05:53.580
- And my sister
just texted me very

01:05:53.580 --> 01:05:58.290
excitedly about your slides
being posted on the website.

01:05:58.290 --> 01:06:03.570
I'm sure she will find it as
thrilling, if not more so.

01:06:03.570 --> 01:06:05.940
So she is actually the
one who has sent me along

01:06:05.940 --> 01:06:07.780
with two questions.

01:06:07.780 --> 01:06:13.470
The first one is you mentioned
IVIg as the primary therapy,

01:06:13.470 --> 01:06:18.720
but are you familiar with
subcutaneous immunoglobulin,

01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:21.360
and if any of your
patients have used it

01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:23.850
as an effective treatment?

01:06:23.850 --> 01:06:26.640
- So the question is
what's the relative roles

01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:31.350
of the same treatment,
which is pooled human Ig

01:06:31.350 --> 01:06:34.080
immunoglobulins taken
from blood donors,

01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:36.840
such as us, healthy
blood donors--

01:06:36.840 --> 01:06:39.390
comparing it when it's
given intravenously,

01:06:39.390 --> 01:06:43.920
which is what IVIg stands for,
as opposed to subcutaneously,

01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:44.910
which is SCIg.

01:06:47.550 --> 01:06:49.830
There are pros and cons
of giving it either way.

01:06:49.830 --> 01:06:51.760
They both get it into your body.

01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:54.270
They're both effective.

01:06:54.270 --> 01:06:56.090
It's really a logistic
issue, and there

01:06:56.090 --> 01:06:59.200
are different logistics,
different insurance companies

01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:01.830
approve it in different ways.

01:07:01.830 --> 01:07:05.370
By the way, I'm telling you
this that we published a paper,

01:07:05.370 --> 01:07:08.880
that it's reasonably effective
as if that means you can then

01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:11.160
go out, and get it.

01:07:11.160 --> 01:07:13.860
Maybe you know already,
but for the rest

01:07:13.860 --> 01:07:17.100
of the audience is that the
insurance companies pretty

01:07:17.100 --> 01:07:20.100
much don't approve
these treatments,

01:07:20.100 --> 01:07:25.060
and it's very rare that
they will approve it.

01:07:25.060 --> 01:07:27.730
The reason is they don't
come to lectures like this.

01:07:27.730 --> 01:07:31.240
There aren't any
medical insurance?

01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:33.160
See?

01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:34.450
I told you so.

01:07:34.450 --> 01:07:35.680
I told you so.

01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:37.660
And because of
that, they may not

01:07:37.660 --> 01:07:40.780
know the things that are
emerging from the leading

01:07:40.780 --> 01:07:42.730
research universities.

01:07:42.730 --> 01:07:45.190
And so therefore,
even though things

01:07:45.190 --> 01:07:48.280
were published, when your
doc tries to get approval

01:07:48.280 --> 01:07:52.840
for treatment, whether it's
subcutaneous or IV, pretty

01:07:52.840 --> 01:07:56.060
much, typically, the
response is no way.

01:07:56.060 --> 01:07:59.440
That's why we put our
paper on the website.

01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:00.940
And if your sister
is interested,

01:08:00.940 --> 01:08:03.280
she needs to get a
copy of that paper

01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:06.820
because you have to physically
take the published evidence,

01:08:06.820 --> 01:08:08.920
give it to your own
treating doctor,

01:08:08.920 --> 01:08:11.440
and have your treating
doctor send it

01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:13.300
to the insurance company.

01:08:13.300 --> 01:08:17.229
And say, well, hey, now there
is evidence that it works.

01:08:17.229 --> 01:08:19.270
So please consider it.

01:08:19.270 --> 01:08:19.810
- Thank you.

01:08:19.810 --> 01:08:24.729
And the second
question was could you

01:08:24.729 --> 01:08:26.439
tell us a little bit
about your thoughts

01:08:26.439 --> 01:08:31.000
on the relation of mast
cells or mast cell activation

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:34.415
disorder to neuropathy?

01:08:34.415 --> 01:08:36.040
- I'm very interested
in that, but it's

01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:38.170
such complicated
questions that let's

01:08:38.170 --> 01:08:42.640
defer that to the
discussion time afterwards.

01:08:42.640 --> 01:08:44.200
Yes, very important.

01:08:44.200 --> 01:08:45.414
Very interesting.

01:08:52.500 --> 01:08:53.100
- Hi.

01:08:53.100 --> 01:08:54.250
Thank you.

01:08:54.250 --> 01:08:56.779
I have one question
that may just

01:08:56.779 --> 01:08:58.939
be restating what
you've said, so I

01:08:58.939 --> 01:09:01.880
apologize if that is all it is.

01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:04.550
But just to clarify, if
you had a patient whose

01:09:04.550 --> 01:09:08.550
say, had a diagnosis of
POTS, and fibromyalgia,

01:09:08.550 --> 01:09:11.840
just as an example, maybe
they were poorly controlled,

01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:19.970
is that enough to say
let's test for this?

01:09:19.970 --> 01:09:24.109
Or are there specific
physical symptoms

01:09:24.109 --> 01:09:28.020
that they should have as well?

01:09:28.020 --> 01:09:29.870
- That's a great question.

01:09:29.870 --> 01:09:33.380
That is a great question.

01:09:33.380 --> 01:09:37.729
And I think, again,
it's an emerging area.

01:09:37.729 --> 01:09:39.779
It's very unclear.

01:09:39.779 --> 01:09:43.010
We don't know for sure who
will, who will not have this.

01:09:43.010 --> 01:09:45.620
We don't even have-- as with
the skin biopsy question,

01:09:45.620 --> 01:09:47.720
there's no perfect test.

01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:50.930
The good news is that there's
an upcoming meeting that

01:09:50.930 --> 01:09:53.240
will bring together
experts around the world

01:09:53.240 --> 01:09:57.290
to develop what's called a
consensus case definition.

01:09:57.290 --> 01:09:59.120
And when there's
a case definition,

01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:02.191
it's very, very helpful, even
though they're not perfect

01:10:02.191 --> 01:10:02.690
either.

01:10:02.690 --> 01:10:04.460
But at least what
it means is there's

01:10:04.460 --> 01:10:07.790
a mutually agreed upon
diagnostic standard

01:10:07.790 --> 01:10:10.620
as to who has it, and
who doesn't have it.

01:10:10.620 --> 01:10:14.600
So that's going to
be very helpful.

01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:28.720
Well, fibromyalgia-- if I
were a fibromyalgia patient,

01:10:28.720 --> 01:10:31.250
I think patients
want to get better.

01:10:31.250 --> 01:10:36.640
And when you have an illness
that is really a label--

01:10:36.640 --> 01:10:39.970
that's the key point, is
that fibromyalgia is not

01:10:39.970 --> 01:10:41.080
a diagnosis.

01:10:41.080 --> 01:10:42.710
It's a label.

01:10:42.710 --> 01:10:45.150
It's a word that we put on
a collection of symptoms.

01:10:45.150 --> 01:10:46.630
It doesn't have one cause.

01:10:46.630 --> 01:10:50.200
Those same symptoms
have different causes

01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:52.990
in different people,
and it's so important

01:10:52.990 --> 01:10:57.760
to move beyond the label, and
press your doctor to tell you

01:10:57.760 --> 01:11:00.460
what's the underlying
medical cause in you.

01:11:00.460 --> 01:11:03.580
And even if they might
not know it in 2017,

01:11:03.580 --> 01:11:07.150
maybe they could figure
it out in 2018, or 2019.

01:11:07.150 --> 01:11:10.480
So I think it's up to each
person with fibromyalgia.

01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:12.580
People have, unfortunately,
different levels

01:11:12.580 --> 01:11:13.990
of medical coverage.

01:11:13.990 --> 01:11:17.770
Some docs are more interested
in pursuing things than others.

01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:23.541
I know what I would do
if I were the patient.

01:11:23.541 --> 01:11:24.040
- Thank you.

01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:25.450
I just-- oh, sorry.

01:11:25.450 --> 01:11:27.820
I just had one other quick
observation if that's OK.

01:11:27.820 --> 01:11:32.520
- Sure, let me just look at time
for one or two more questions.

01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:37.100
And in the interest of side
of the room parity, and gender

01:11:37.100 --> 01:11:39.770
parity, I also want to
invite this gentleman here,

01:11:39.770 --> 01:11:42.021
who's had his hand up
since the beginning.

01:11:42.021 --> 01:11:44.020
Kristen, maybe you could
put your hand up again.

01:11:44.020 --> 01:11:46.400
Why don't you ask
your last question--

01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:47.860
And I'm happy to stick around.

01:11:47.860 --> 01:11:52.270
So if you didn't get your
question answered in public.

01:11:52.270 --> 01:11:54.940
- This, I hope, is a
fairly short question.

01:11:54.940 --> 01:11:58.150
I'm interested in the
dynamics of the pathology.

01:11:58.150 --> 01:12:01.000
In other words, if you have a
patient with a positive skin

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:01.980
test who responds--

01:12:01.980 --> 01:12:04.280
- Could you speak
a little louder?

01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:06.730
- If you have a patient
with a positive skin

01:12:06.730 --> 01:12:11.250
test who responds to
immunotherapy of some sort,

01:12:11.250 --> 01:12:15.850
how rapidly does the
skin biopsy return?

01:12:15.850 --> 01:12:17.090
- Great question.

01:12:17.090 --> 01:12:20.560
We don't recommend repeating
skin biopsies more often

01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:24.280
than once a year because the
pathology, as important, as

01:12:24.280 --> 01:12:27.070
vital as it is, changes slowly.

01:12:27.070 --> 01:12:30.100
Then it takes a while for
the nerve cells to regrow,

01:12:30.100 --> 01:12:32.560
and they may not even
regrow in everybody,

01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:35.650
and they may regrow at different
rates than somebody who's 15,

01:12:35.650 --> 01:12:37.960
than somebody who's 65.

01:12:37.960 --> 01:12:40.450
So as of now, the
skin biopsies are

01:12:40.450 --> 01:12:44.320
most helpful for initial
diagnosis, and their role

01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:46.090
in tracking patients.

01:12:46.090 --> 01:12:48.970
In fact, we're just
applying for an NIH grant

01:12:48.970 --> 01:12:52.270
to try and better clarify
which are the outcomes that

01:12:52.270 --> 01:12:55.060
are most useful for
longitudinal tracking,

01:12:55.060 --> 01:12:58.150
as opposed to initial
cross-sectional diagnosis.

01:12:58.150 --> 01:12:59.140
Good question.

01:12:59.140 --> 01:13:01.894
Worth waiting for.

01:13:01.894 --> 01:13:02.810
- As was this lecture.

01:13:02.810 --> 01:13:05.440
So I think I have to cut off
the questions, officially,

01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:07.856
for the group, and let people
get out who need to get out.

01:13:07.856 --> 01:13:11.140
But I know that Dr. Oaklander
is going to stay up here,

01:13:11.140 --> 01:13:13.822
and can answer a few more
questions from you, personally.

01:13:13.822 --> 01:13:15.280
And I just want to
thank you again.

01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:16.750
This is just terrific stuff.

01:13:16.750 --> 01:13:19.200
[APPLAUSE]
