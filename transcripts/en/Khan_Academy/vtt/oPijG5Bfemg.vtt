00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:01.940
- [Instructor] Let's say
that we're given the equation

00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:05.060
that y squared minus x squared

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.430
is equal to four.

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:11.890
And our goal is to find
the second derivative of y

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:14.930
with respect to x, and we want to

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.130
find an expression for it
in terms of x's and y's.

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.750
So pause this video, and see
if you can work through this.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:24.860
All right, now let's do it together.

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.550
Now, some of you might
have wanted to solve for y

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.510
and then use some traditional techniques.

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.200
But here, we have a y squared,

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.450
and so it might involve a
plus or a minus square root.

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.410
And so some of y'all
might have realized, hey,

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.810
we can do a little bit of
implicit differentiation,

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.310
which is really just an
application of the chain rule.

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:42.180
So let's do that.

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.070
Let's first find the first derivative

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.470
of y with respect to x.

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.540
And to do that, I'll
just take the derivative

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.343
with respect to x of both
sides of this equation.

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.020
And then what do we get?

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.590
Well, the derivative with
respect to x of y squared,

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.080
we're gonna use the chain rule here.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:00.270
First, we can take the derivative

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.280
of y squared with respect to y,

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.260
which is going to be equal to two y,

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.000
and then that times the
derivative of y with respect to x.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.850
Once again, this comes
straight out of the chain rule.

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.020
And then, from that, we will subtract,

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.710
what's the derivative of x
squared with respect to x?

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.670
Well, that's just going to be two x.

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.040
And then last, but not least,

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.020
what is the derivative of a
constant with respect to x?

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.853
Well, it doesn't change,

00:01:25.853 --> 00:01:28.770
so it's just going to be equal to zero.

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.870
All right, now we can solve for

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.610
our first derivative
of y with respect to x.

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:34.443
Let's do that.

00:01:34.443 --> 00:01:36.430
We can add two x to both sides,

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.410
and we would get two y
times the derivative of y

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.860
with respect to x is equal to

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.160
two x.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:50.160
And now I can divide both
sides by two y, and I am going

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:51.850
to get

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.280
that the derivative of y

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.110
with respect to x is equal to x,

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.803
x over y.

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.630
Now, the next step is
let's take the derivative

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.930
of both sides of this with respect to x,

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.770
and then we can hopefully
find our second derivative

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.540
of y with respect to x.

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.520
And to help us there,
actually let me rewrite this.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.800
And I always forget the quotient rule,

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.400
although it might be a useful
thing for you to remember.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.240
But I could rewrite this as a product,

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.010
which will help me at least.

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.740
So I'm going to rewrite
this as the derivative of y

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.100
with respect to x is equal to

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.620
x times y to the negative one power,

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.670
y to the negative one power.

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.380
And now, if we want to
find the second derivative,

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.100
we apply the derivative operator

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.710
on both sides of this equation,

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:45.150
derivative with respect to x.

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.350
And our left-hand side is exactly

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.480
what we eventually wanted to get,

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.520
so the second derivative
of y with respect to x.

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.900
And what do we get here
on the right-hand side?

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.480
Well, we can apply the product rule.

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.320
So first, we can say the
derivative of x with respect to x,

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.840
well, that is just going to
be one times the other thing,

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.460
so times y to the negative one power,

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:13.630
y to the negative one power.

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.890
And then we have plus

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.470
x times the derivative
of y to the negative one.

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.180
So plus x,

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.170
what's the, times,

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.880
what's the derivative of y
to the negative one power?

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.540
Well, first, we can find the derivative

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.660
of y to the negative one
power with respect to y.

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.150
We'll just leverage the power rule there.

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.410
So that's going to be negative one

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:36.340
times y to the negative two power.

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.560
And then we would multiply that

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.200
times the derivative
of y with respect to x,

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.340
just an application of the chain rule,

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.180
times dy/dx.

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.090
And remember, we know what the derivative

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.740
of y with respect to x is.

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:51.000
We already solved for that.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.900
It is x over y.

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.620
So this over here is going to be x over y.

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.490
And so now we just have to
simplify this expression.

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:02.210
This is going to be equal to,

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:03.720
and I'll try to do it part by part,

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.520
that part right over there is
just going to be a one over y.

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.210
And then all of this business,

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:12.140
let's see if I can simplify that.

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.030
This negative is going to
go out front, so minus,

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.770
and then I'm going to have
x times x in the numerator.

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:22.010
And then it's going to
be divided by y squared

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.250
and then divided by another y.

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.810
So it's going to be minus x squared

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:30.390
over y to the third,

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:32.840
over y to the third, or
another way to think about it,

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.830
x squared times y to the negative three.

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.050
And we are done.

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.080
We have just figured out
the second derivative of y

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.730
with respect to x

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:46.303
in terms of x's and y's.
