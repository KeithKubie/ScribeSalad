00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:03.460
LAURA LING: Rhinoceros are some
of the most endangered species

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:04.510
in the world.

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:07.590
They're poached for their horns,
which have been used primarily

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.580
in Asian countries as a
traditional medicine and status

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:11.320
symbol.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.290
Demand for rhino horns
has been growing.

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.710
Last year, over
1,200 rhinos were

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.040
poached, which is roughly
one every eight hours.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.570
It's believed the entire
rhino species could be

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.090
extinct within 5 to 10 years.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.050
George Bonaci and
Matthew Markus,

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.090
co-founders of Pembient,
believe they can save the rhino

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.075
with their 3D printed horns.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.550
This is a 3D printed
rhinoceros horn

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.342
that would be virtually
identical to a real rhino horn.

00:00:40.342 --> 00:00:41.300
GEORGE BONACI: Exactly.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.090
Their horns go for
$60,000 a kilogram.

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.840
LAURA LING: So this is more
expensive than cocaine?

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.010
GEORGE BONACI: Exactly, yes.

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.135
LAURA LING: So how do you
3D print a rhino horn?

00:00:52.135 --> 00:00:54.010
GEORGE BONACI: So our
goal was to first start

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.570
with a powder that was
identical to the real thing.

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.320
We combined inorganics,
metals, minerals, as well as

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.320
other proteins.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.806
We also incorporated real
rhino DNA into it, as well.

00:01:02.806 --> 00:01:05.180
And then from there we were
thinking, how can we get this

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.830
into chunks, and then eventually
bigger and bigger shapes,

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.610
that will resemble
a real rhino horn?

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.910
And we ended up designing
our own 3D printer.

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:14.510
Using our powders really
build up an actual horn.

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.920
LAURA LING: So are you
saying that your 3D printed

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.270
horn is virtually the same as
a real born in shape, size,

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:23.220
structure?

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:23.740
GEORGE BONACI: Yes, yes.

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.450
We took it to a lab
and had them test it,

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.030
and it would come
back as rhino horn.

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:27.842
We did a DNA test.

00:01:27.842 --> 00:01:29.300
It would come back
as from a rhino.

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.574
So we start it
off with a powder.

00:01:35.574 --> 00:01:37.240
And this is how it's
typically consumed.

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.270
They'll grind the horn
down and consume it.

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.460
This was our first
3D printed prototype

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.000
that resembles a highly
oxidized rhino horn.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.229
And then this is a
more recent prototype,

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.520
where we're trying to get
bigger and bigger, ultimately

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.170
to the full size, like 2
and 1/2 foot rhino horns.

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:52.670
LAURA LING: And how
do you guys plan

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.280
to get this onto the market?

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.420
GEORGE BONACI: So we're planning
on going through partnerships

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:57.470
with existing companies.

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.812
The supplement companies,
cosmetics companies.

00:01:59.812 --> 00:02:02.270
A lot of the poachers in Africa
that are doing the killing,

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.530
they're doing it because
they're very poor.

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.960
And killing one rhino would
feed your family for years,

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:07.880
potentially.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.930
So one idea we've had
would be giving it to them,

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:11.679
or selling it to them
at a large discount,

00:02:11.679 --> 00:02:14.210
so they can then sell it through
the black market channels.

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.080
They still make a
living for their family.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.500
The end user still gets it.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.356
It's pure, but the
rhinos get to survive.

00:02:19.356 --> 00:02:21.230
LAURA LING: There are
those critics out there

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.430
who had said that
this might actually

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:24.800
do more harm than good.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.900
It's a noble idea,
but it might actually

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.450
legitimize this idea that
it is actual medicine,

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.480
or increase demand for it.

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.020
GEORGE BONACI: If
we can basically

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.330
fill the supply with an
identical product at a cheaper

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.672
price, it's going to decrease
the price for the product.

00:02:39.672 --> 00:02:42.130
And therefore, there's going
to be less incentive to poach.

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.296
Why would you risk your
life and go and kill a rhino

00:02:44.296 --> 00:02:46.065
and make a species
extinct, when you

00:02:46.065 --> 00:02:48.130
can go buy it from a my
store for 1/10 the price?

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.340
Just going over to
Vietnam and telling people

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.470
to stop doing it, that
alone is not going to help.

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:53.822
You also need an alternative.

00:02:53.822 --> 00:02:56.280
It'd be like if someone came
to the United States and said,

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.239
cutting down Christmas trees
at Christmas time is stupid,

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:00.030
there's no purpose.

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.460
Rhino horn is really just
a traditional thing you do.

00:03:06.624 --> 00:03:08.040
LAURA LING: It's
pretty incredible

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.195
that this technology can
allow you to do this.

00:03:10.195 --> 00:03:12.570
GEORGE BONACI: This probably
would not have been possible

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.647
5,10 years ago.

00:03:14.647 --> 00:03:16.230
LAURA LING: How much
of a game changer

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:17.522
do you think this will be?

00:03:17.522 --> 00:03:19.230
GEORGE BONACI: Well,
I hope and I believe

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:20.330
that it will save the species.

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:21.740
That's the reason
why we're doing it.

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:24.230
I think now is probably the
time to give it a try no matter

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:24.990
what.

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:27.610
And really, it might
be their only hope.

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:34.850
NARRATOR: Be sure to watch
this next episode of "Seeker

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:35.510
Stories."

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:36.885
LAURA LING: There
are some people

00:03:36.885 --> 00:03:39.280
who say that what
you're suffering from

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.110
is not a condition.

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.210
It's an affliction,
it's in your head.

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:44.660
How does that make you feel?
