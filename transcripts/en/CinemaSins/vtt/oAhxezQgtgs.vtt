00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.690
Time to debate Lincoln.

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:06.690
Oy.

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.129
You didn’t like Lincoln?

00:00:08.129 --> 00:00:12.309
I liked it about as much as you can like a
2 and a half hour history lesson, sure.

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:14.619
(laughs)
You know those film strips they used to show

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:16.100
us back in high school?

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.530
It was about as entertaining as one of those.

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:21.350
That’s a huge overstatement, and you know
it.

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:22.350
Is it?

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.370
Yes it is.

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:26.810
Is this or is it not, at the end of the day,
a movie that’s about the passing of a piece

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:27.810
of legislation?

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:28.810
It is.

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:33.120
Might as well be an episode of The West Wing,
circa 1865, only with even less snappy banter.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.159
That’s a good joke, but it’s not remotely
accurate, and you know it.

00:00:36.159 --> 00:00:37.600
(THAT WAS EASY).

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.120
Do you ever get tired of losing to me in these
debates?

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.879
I get tired of you scoring points without
actual debate, but I can do it too.

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:46.520
Daniel Day Lewis was awesome in this movie,
and there can be no argument.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.770
(THAT WAS EASY)
Liam Neeson would have been better.

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:52.770
What?

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:53.770
What did you say?

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:54.770
Nothing.

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:55.770
Alright, my turn.

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:56.770
The speechifying.

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:58.260
The what?

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.260
The speechifying.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.680
You know how I knew Daniel Day Lewis was going
to win the Oscar for this movie?

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.530
Because every other scene in this movie is
a speech, soliloquy, or big storytelling moment

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:06.530
for Lincoln.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.899
The only scenes in the movie that aren’t
big Lincoln speeches are the scenes where

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:11.619
he’s walking from place to place in between
two big Lincoln speeches.

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:14.469
I think Lincoln himself was prone to giving
speeches and stories…

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:19.609
I don’t care if it’s all he ever did in
his old-timey life, it doesn’t make for

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:20.609
good cinema.

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:21.609
They should have called it Best Actor: The
Movie.

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:24.469
( THAT WAS EASY)
Now, I’m gonna argue this with you becausetThe

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:28.021
speechifying was what made it good, you can’t
just go scoring points whenever you want to.

00:01:28.021 --> 00:01:30.039
You know when I’m allowed to score points
for something like that?

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:31.340
Now, now now!

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.939
(THAT WAS EASY)
You’re a dick.

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:38.049
Not as big a dick as Lincoln was to his son,
and that’s my next point.

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:43.590
How can a movie that celebrates a cold, distant,
emotionally abusive father like this as a

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.210
hero be a good movie?

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.659
(THAT WAS EASY)
It worked for Star Wars.

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.350
Another problem… no suspense.

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:51.350
No suspense?

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:52.350
You’ve gotta be kidding me.

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.670
There’s no suspense in this movie.

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.110
From the first few minutes I knew that they
were going to get the legislation passed.

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.369
That’s because it happened in real life!!

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:00.369
Exactly.

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:02.009
Bad writing.

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.649
Way too predictable.

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:09.770
Do you feel the same way about Apollo 13 then?

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.640
Well was Apollo 13 real?!

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.020
Yes.

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.400
Yes.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.680
I’m taking a point either way.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.780
(THAT WAS EASY) And I’m also taking a point
for the ending, okay, where they cop out and

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:23.780
show his death.

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.190
You can’t do a Lincoln movie without showing
his death.

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.570
Then f*cking show it!

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:32.320
Don’t flash forward, allude to it, then
flash back to another d*mn speech.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.320
Alright?

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.470
Have the balls to show it if you’re gonna
show it.

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.200
But you just spent the last two and a half
hours telling me this movie was about the

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.760
legislation and not the assassination, alright,
so then have the balls to end it without copping

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:43.880
out and going to the assassination.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.380
I think maybe you--
(THAT WAS EASY) I’m also taking a point

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:49.380
because Lincoln’s dirty.

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:50.570
Lincoln is dirty?

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:51.620
He’s dirty man.

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:57.440
He hires those lobbyists to bribe, intimidate,
coerce, and he basically buys the vote.

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.590
So this movie’s conclusion is that dirty
politics is okay, as long as you’re right.

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.200
And that doesn’t work because every f*cking
politician thinks they’re right, and they

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.200
can’t all be right.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.760
(THAT WAS EASY)
If you think politicians are pure at all then

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.290
you probably think the Earth is flat.

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.580
Of course I do, don’t be an idiot.

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.400
The Earth is round, dumbass.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.850
That’s what I said.

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:18.850
Shut up.

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:20.390
I know what I said.
