00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:05.710
You are listening to radiolab radio from w n y.

2
00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:13.950
S. E. Yep. Your name again is Cedric Fedrick.

3
00:00:13.951 --> 00:00:17.100
I'm going to write that then and there on the line now so you'll be able to talk

4
00:00:17.101 --> 00:00:20.610
to them. So how can you hear me? Hello? Hi. Okay.

5
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:22.230
I'm Robert Krulwich.

6
00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:26.320
Moonrise is radiolab and a little while ago I produced her Latif.

7
00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.380
Nasser brought us a story about a guy.

8
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.500
<v 1>My name is Harold Herring. Uh,</v>

9
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.640
I use the middle initial l for Louis and honor of my father

10
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.690
<v 0>who asked a question. It was a pretty simple question. Um,</v>

11
00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.060
maybe a dangerous question, maybe a dangerous question.

12
00:00:42.061 --> 00:00:46.650
Certainly just the mere asking of it pretty much ruined the man's life and he

13
00:00:46.651 --> 00:00:47.640
never got an answer. No.

14
00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.750
But today on radio that we are going to re ask Harold's question and this time

15
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.890
we get an answer and let of Nassar takes it from here. Yeah.

16
00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.230
So our main guy, Harold,

17
00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.650
he's former military and he's 81 years old.

18
00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.250
<v 1>I'm staying pretty active. Uh,</v>

19
00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:09.200
I'm competing at the national and the world level at a duathalon competition.

20
00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.230
<v 0>Wow. And right off the bat,</v>

21
00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.380
this is the kind of guy you could tell he just does not give up.

22
00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.630
<v 1>I really am not supposed to be competing because I've had both knees replaced.</v>

23
00:01:18.631 --> 00:01:19.620
But anyway,

24
00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.410
<v 0>a Harold grew up in this tiny town called Browns, Illinois from a poor family.</v>

25
00:01:24.411 --> 00:01:27.770
He was the eldest of 11 kids. Um, when he was growing up,

26
00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.850
he would always hear air force planes flying overhead.

27
00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.160
And that's why from when he was very young,

28
00:01:34.161 --> 00:01:36.770
he always wanted to be an air force pilot.

29
00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.930
So why don't you just tell us a little bit about your military background? Yeah,

30
00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.940
the writers, most of my career was with the air rescue service.

31
00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.550
This was in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War.

32
00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.960
And if an air force pilot went down, got shot down, whatever,

33
00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.450
Harold and his team would jump into their helicopters to draw green.

34
00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.150
Have you left helicopters? It flyman hover over the survivors on the ground,

35
00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:02.800
lowering the place cable.

36
00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.620
And then a para rescue man would climb down to the forest floor,

37
00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.810
find the injured soldier and attach the cable to him. Yeah.

38
00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.880
And while that was happening, Harold had to hold the helicopter steady.

39
00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.340
He had to hold his hopper.

40
00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.570
<v 1>And a lot of times the enemy would wait until that process started before they</v>

41
00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.720
will,

42
00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.780
<v 0>I'm fired coming up.</v>

43
00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.830
<v 1>I had some wonderful experiences,</v>

44
00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:33.250
probably chief among them with my crew and I,

45
00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.550
we picked up a pilot that ejected into the North Sea at night in a wintertime.

46
00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.660
Whoa. A 200 miles out to sea. We picked him up and brought him back.

47
00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.590
<v 0>So it was a super high risk, high adrenaline kind of job.</v>

48
00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.100
<v 1>And I had an outstanding record.</v>

49
00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.030
<v 0>And then, well he got old. How old were you around this time?</v>

50
00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.260
<v 1>Oh, about about 30 out old,</v>

51
00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:03.553
um,

52
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.700
pilot from my age and with my experience we're putting into desk jobs and uh,

53
00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.640
I wanted to be on the front line if I could.

54
00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.580
<v 2>This was 1973 middle of the Cold War.</v>

55
00:03:15.581 --> 00:03:19.990
So Harold decided that the way for him to be on the front lines without actually

56
00:03:19.991 --> 00:03:23.410
having to be on the front lines, you know, cause he couldn't anymore,

57
00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:25.930
was to go into training to become

58
00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.270
<v 3>a missile lear, a missile launch officer.</v>

59
00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.910
Those are the people who sit in a underground bunker and just wait to get an

60
00:03:35.461 --> 00:03:40.260
order to turn their key and unleash a nuclear attack and training.

61
00:03:40.261 --> 00:03:43.230
I mean just the intro like uh,

62
00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.650
I can remember just virtually verbatim is that each method launch author has

63
00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:56.090
under his direct control more fire power than all generals and all wars in the

64
00:03:58.561 --> 00:03:59.640
history of warfare.

65
00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.920
<v 4>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

66
00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.920
<v 2>Harold started his training at the Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.</v>

67
00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:22.080
Nixon was president at the time and at the time the prospect of nuclear war felt

68
00:04:22.781 --> 00:04:23.830
very real,

69
00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.250
<v 1>a lot of responsibility there. And there's no room for error.</v>

70
00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.040
<v 2>And so in Harold's training, we were a very small class.</v>

71
00:04:31.041 --> 00:04:33.590
He learned all about the technical stuff, you know,

72
00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.930
<v 1>all the mechanical stuff in emergency procedure that we're in</v>

73
00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.800
<v 2>all the nitty gritty details of how a missile actually lawn.</v>

74
00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.300
<v 1>And then part of the time we had classroom instruction</v>

75
00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:47.690
<v 2>where he learned about the chain of command and all the different safeguards and</v>

76
00:04:47.691 --> 00:04:51.290
checks. So imagine that he gets an order to launch.

77
00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:52.910
That order has to be decoded.

78
00:04:52.911 --> 00:04:56.030
So he would decode the order and then his partner would decode the order and

79
00:04:56.031 --> 00:04:59.750
then they would verify it with one another. So one guy would be like, okay, uh,

80
00:04:59.751 --> 00:05:03.320
I got the order, uh, Alpha Bravo one, two, four. And then his partner would say,

81
00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:06.230
I confirm Alpha Bravo one, two, four,

82
00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:09.290
and then they launch.

83
00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:15.370
So neither of them has the power to launch on his or her own.

84
00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:19.880
<v 1>And both of you were armed. You, you carried a sidearm with you.</v>

85
00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:24.380
Why? Well, you know, it's serious business. And if you had someone that was,

86
00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:27.170
you know, if, if they threatened your life,

87
00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:31.700
if one of the officers wanted to just go rogue, you had a side arm to, well,

88
00:05:31.701 --> 00:05:34.730
if I took my gun and pointed at you and say, turn the key Harold,

89
00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:38.840
but I wouldn't do it. I may go down, but I'd be drawn my weapon.

90
00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:40.640
And these keys have to be turned simultaneously.

91
00:05:40.641 --> 00:05:44.870
So if I shoot you turn my key then rover get your key and turn your key.

92
00:05:44.871 --> 00:05:47.200
That's too late, right? It has to be a simultaneous. Yes.

93
00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:47.880
<v 2>Yes.</v>

94
00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:52.770
So the whole point is the system is designed so that no one person can launch a

95
00:05:52.771 --> 00:05:53.670
nuclear attack.

96
00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:57.980
<v 1>I was very pleased, very satisfied with the and balances</v>

97
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:01.010
<v 0>at the crew member level, the bottom where they're turning the keys.</v>

98
00:06:01.011 --> 00:06:05.110
I was not concerned about that at all. But then a few weeks into training,

99
00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:05.973
there was a,

100
00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:10.130
<v 1>uh, some discussion about preemptive strike</v>

101
00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:15.190
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

102
00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:16.023
<v 0>real quick.</v>

103
00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:20.500
Obviously if someone launched a nuclear attack against the U s we would be able

104
00:06:20.501 --> 00:06:22.540
to strike back, you know, in response.

105
00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:27.400
But a preemptive strike would be where we, for whatever reason,

106
00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:29.860
decided to strike first

107
00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:37.440
<v 1>and that raises the hair on the back of my neck a little bit.</v>

108
00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:39.150
You know, it's just,

109
00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:44.670
I've thought we're receiving all of this information about all these elaborate

110
00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:48.050
checks and balances within the system, but

111
00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:51.900
<v 0>they never got any information about how things worked at the presidential</v>

112
00:06:51.901 --> 00:06:52.734
level.

113
00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:58.530
<v 1>There is a complete void or blackout at the level that the order is initiated.</v>

114
00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:04.320
<v 0>Well, you had this thought that you say to the other classmates,</v>

115
00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:05.363
<v 1>no, I didn't.</v>

116
00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:10.400
It wasn't my intent to try to create a sane by involving other people,

117
00:07:10.471 --> 00:07:12.090
students, whatever. So

118
00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.890
<v 0>Harold waits until the end of class walks up to the front of the room and asks</v>

119
00:07:15.891 --> 00:07:20.000
the instructor a question, a very reasonable question. He's like,

120
00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.170
just checking.

121
00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:24.530
There's a safety net in place if the president is making a crazy decision.

122
00:07:24.531 --> 00:07:24.910
Right.

123
00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:29.530
<v 1>I want her to find out more about checks and balances at the top level.</v>

124
00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:32.920
<v 0>And the instructor pauses looked at him and says,</v>

125
00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:38.920
can you put that in writing, please? Okay. And so he did.

126
00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:40.690
Let me find it first.

127
00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:47.110
You do your best to have everything ready to go. No, no, no. Take your time.

128
00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:50.290
Yeah. Oh, here it is. Okay.

129
00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:55.050
<v 1>There is presently a degree of doubt in my mind as to whether I might,</v>

130
00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:59.610
I'm going to be called upon to launch nuclear weapons as a result of an invalid

131
00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:00.780
unlawful order.

132
00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:03.780
<v 0>This is part of the letter that Harold wrote explaining his question.</v>

133
00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:08.700
I asked myself, how will I know or can I be sure I'm,

134
00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:11.370
I am participating in a justifiable act.

135
00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:14.400
In his letter he says that if he were ordered to attorney's key,

136
00:08:14.401 --> 00:08:16.080
he would absolutely do so.

137
00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:21.650
But because he had not been told what the checks and balances are for the

138
00:08:21.751 --> 00:08:26.610
president, he would be doing so with a conflict of conscience,

139
00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:27.693
<v 1>which I've underlying,</v>

140
00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:33.190
I would be required to assign Ryan faith values to my judgment of one man,

141
00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:38.000
the president values, which could ultimately include, hey,

142
00:08:38.001 --> 00:08:41.600
off personality and political considerations.

143
00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:44.430
This just should not be [inaudible].

144
00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:53.570
<v 0>So we've got a guy training to be the person who pulls the trigger and he's</v>

145
00:08:53.571 --> 00:08:56.100
sitting there wondering, okay, there's lot of checks

146
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:59.160
<v 6>on me, but who's checking the precedent?</v>

147
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.980
And this struck us as a really, um,

148
00:09:02.530 --> 00:09:05.910
kind of serious question because right now we have a president,

149
00:09:05.911 --> 00:09:10.080
president Trump who is clearly interested in nuclear weapons.

150
00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:14.520
He talks about it constantly and you've got the thing with North Korea. Yeah.

151
00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:16.110
Escalating tensions with North Korea.

152
00:09:16.111 --> 00:09:19.290
Syria for Christ sakes sort of makes you stop and think like, okay,

153
00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:22.350
if and when these decisions get made, how are they made?

154
00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:26.250
Is there someone else in the room? Yeah, and who if the president is,

155
00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:28.410
is determined if he, if he's ready to go,

156
00:09:28.411 --> 00:09:31.710
is there somebody there who can turn to the president and see,

157
00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:36.250
<v 7>stop. That is a great question.</v>

158
00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:41.250
<v 2>This is historian Alex Wallerstein. He's the one who introduced us to Harold.</v>

159
00:09:41.251 --> 00:09:45.060
He wrote an article in the Washington Post about this very topic.

160
00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:46.890
Am I at the right place? Yeah.

161
00:09:46.891 --> 00:09:51.210
You tend to want to be just like a fists length away. Yeah. Yeah. Perfect.

162
00:09:51.211 --> 00:09:56.211
And he has spent so much time in just archives behind microfilm readers and

163
00:09:57.830 --> 00:10:01.590
foiling documents and doing all kinds of different things to figure out the

164
00:10:01.591 --> 00:10:06.591
history of our relationship to this uniquely destructive weapon.

165
00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:11.780
And what he found was a kind of tug of war between the military and the

166
00:10:12.841 --> 00:10:15.960
president that has gone back more than 70 years

167
00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:19.980
<v 8>as the nation has planted into morning by President Roosevelt's death.</v>

168
00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:23.310
How are you? Ask Roman becomes president. This happened.

169
00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:27.970
<v 7>Truman learned he had a balm the day that Roosevelt died. Hmm.</v>

170
00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:30.970
<v 2>This is April, 1945 at this point,</v>

171
00:10:30.971 --> 00:10:33.940
America has been at war with Japan for over three years.

172
00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.020
<v 7>It was impressed upon Truman that this was not just another weapon,</v>

173
00:10:38.021 --> 00:10:41.920
that this was something that could be bigger and better than any other weapon

174
00:10:41.921 --> 00:10:46.660
before. But there's no point in which somebody says, Hey, Mr President,

175
00:10:46.661 --> 00:10:48.520
should we bomb Japan with this bomb?

176
00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:52.210
It assumed that of course you're going to do it. You have the bomb,

177
00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:56.080
you have the enemy. And in fact, nobody ever goes to Truman and says,

178
00:10:56.170 --> 00:11:01.090
should we do this? Really? They go to him and they say, we are doing this.

179
00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:04.930
So Truman writes in his journal, we're going to use the atomic bomb,

180
00:11:04.931 --> 00:11:07.570
but we will not use it on a civilian target.

181
00:11:07.571 --> 00:11:12.030
We will use it on a purely military target. That's the term purely, purely.

182
00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:14.610
<v 2>Now we can't get into his head to know exactly what he was thinking.</v>

183
00:11:14.611 --> 00:11:16.890
But that is what he wrote in his journal at the time.

184
00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:19.470
<v 7>And then he says, we will not be killing women and children.</v>

185
00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:25.280
So the first atomic bomb is going to be dropped by a president who thinks that

186
00:11:25.591 --> 00:11:27.770
he's dropping it on soldiers only. He,

187
00:11:27.771 --> 00:11:32.130
he's somewhat congratulating himself on that no women and children will be

188
00:11:32.131 --> 00:11:33.150
killed in this attack.

189
00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:37.490
<v 9>The world would to note that the first that's now the bomb was dropped on</v>

190
00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:39.950
Hiroshima, a military thing.

191
00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:44.250
<v 7>That's part of Truman's announcement after they dropped the bomb the day after</v>

192
00:11:44.251 --> 00:11:49.050
they get casualty estimates from the Japanese and he realizes this is not purely

193
00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:49.943
a military.

194
00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:52.860
<v 9>There is reason to believe that the Japanese of ghetto,</v>

195
00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:58.600
approximately the size of Memphis or theatrical or Rochester New York no longer

196
00:11:59.050 --> 00:11:59.883
exists.

197
00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:03.940
<v 2>The total death toll was almost 200,000</v>

198
00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:07.890
<v 7>so there's a real switch that happens between Truman talking about the bomb and</v>

199
00:12:07.891 --> 00:12:10.770
also everything he says about the bomb before he hears about the casualties.

200
00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:12.330
It's held about the greatest thing ever.

201
00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:15.990
And this is the greatest day in history and he's so proud and so happy.

202
00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:18.690
And then he hears about the casualties and hears about the women and children

203
00:12:18.691 --> 00:12:23.580
and suddenly it becomes a a burden. Now what happened? So on August 10th,

204
00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:25.110
he gets a message from General Grove,

205
00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:28.820
<v 8>Nagasaki, just three days after Hiroshima,</v>

206
00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:32.590
<v 7>sorry, we dropped two bombs. Uh, we're going to have a third one in a week,</v>

207
00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:34.090
just FYI.

208
00:12:34.450 --> 00:12:38.050
And it's not clear that Truman knew that two bombs are going to be dropped so

209
00:12:38.051 --> 00:12:42.460
soon. Wow. So he is just learned that Hiroshima is a city.

210
00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:44.620
When he just learns that another city, it's destroyed.

211
00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:49.680
He is not in control and he has immediately written back to them and says,

212
00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:52.150
just stop. Knock it off.

213
00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:55.630
You are not going to drop another bomb without express permission of the

214
00:12:55.631 --> 00:12:56.890
president of the United States.

215
00:12:57.310 --> 00:13:01.990
So the major theme of Truman's approach to nuclear weapons is to keep them out

216
00:13:01.991 --> 00:13:06.970
of the hands of the military. Why? He believes that the military,

217
00:13:06.971 --> 00:13:10.720
if you give them a new weapon, they will use it. It's not a crazy idea.

218
00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:15.010
<v 2>So they actually start to design and build these bombs to make sure the military</v>

219
00:13:15.011 --> 00:13:16.480
can't launch them on its own.

220
00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:21.520
<v 7>The nuclear parts of the bomb have to be in the possession of the civilians in</v>

221
00:13:21.521 --> 00:13:24.970
nuclear books. So the plutonium, the plutonium, the core, right.

222
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.320
And the early bombs allow you to do that.

223
00:13:26.321 --> 00:13:29.860
The front of them actually open up and allow you to stick for Corrine and close

224
00:13:29.861 --> 00:13:34.150
it back up. So the civilians walk into the room with the explosive part,

225
00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:38.140
the soldiers open the lid. Yes, this civilians,

226
00:13:38.141 --> 00:13:41.370
but the explosive part in close the door. Now you have an act of bounds.

227
00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:45.140
<v 2>So it's like putting in a battery or something. Almost like into your Walkman.</v>

228
00:13:45.141 --> 00:13:48.350
Why do I have that analogy? Am I like 80 year olds?

229
00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:50.390
<v 7>Where does the prison put the nuclear pipe?</v>

230
00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:53.180
They have their own faults with their own guys,

231
00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:58.070
but their own guns and their job is to shoot anybody who tries to take a corp

232
00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:00.050
without presidential authorization.

233
00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:04.330
<v 2>Wow. So for the rest of his presidential term, Truman doesn't budge.</v>

234
00:14:04.450 --> 00:14:07.210
The nuclear power is his and his alone

235
00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:09.980
<v 5>[inaudible].</v>

236
00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:12.830
<v 7>But the technology starts to make it trickier to do this.</v>

237
00:14:13.130 --> 00:14:17.630
If you want a very small atomic bomb, you can't separate the pit out from that.

238
00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:18.650
It's just not going to happen.

239
00:14:18.651 --> 00:14:21.680
It's physically like glued to the explosives and things like that.

240
00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:24.910
<v 8>So</v>

241
00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:27.620
<v 2>it's 1953 just a few years before Harold entered. Yeah.</v>

242
00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:30.840
<v 8>Military Mandarin chief returns to Fort Benning, Georgia. Sir</v>

243
00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:35.320
<v 2>President Eisenhower comes to power and he's a former general, right, exactly.</v>

244
00:14:35.321 --> 00:14:39.160
And so he's a little bit less concerned about who has control over these nuclear

245
00:14:39.161 --> 00:14:41.320
weapons. So he eases up a little bit

246
00:14:41.530 --> 00:14:44.920
<v 7>and he says in his administration, um, atomic weapons,</v>

247
00:14:44.921 --> 00:14:48.100
small ones are to be treated as basically any other kind of weapon,

248
00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:52.730
<v 8>a nuclear age, arts and alum. Awesome report. This archival footage from 1961</v>

249
00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:56.150
<v 0>president Eisenhower is getting a first look at some of the newest additions to</v>

250
00:14:56.151 --> 00:14:57.230
the nuclear arsenal.

251
00:14:57.420 --> 00:15:01.470
<v 8>He pulls out his binoculars to watch helicopters and foot soldiers in the field.</v>

252
00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:04.920
<v 0>At that time they were getting really creative with their new nuclear weapons.</v>

253
00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:09.050
<v 8>It go like weapon is the [inaudible] a one man operated missile launch here.</v>

254
00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:13.210
<v 7>Does he continue to maintain the authority over the bigger bombs?</v>

255
00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:16.570
He allows them to be transferred to the military. But he says,

256
00:15:16.571 --> 00:15:18.790
don't drop them with on my permission. Ah,

257
00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:23.710
but there are some cases in which he says under really bad circumstances you can

258
00:15:23.711 --> 00:15:26.920
use some of these weapons without my permission. So compared to Truman,

259
00:15:26.921 --> 00:15:30.670
he's really shifting that power back to the military. Yes, but evening,

260
00:15:30.671 --> 00:15:33.670
my fellow citizens, by the time Kennedy is the president,

261
00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:36.180
<v 10>it is an ironic what? Accurate. Back</v>

262
00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:39.470
<v 7>1961 Harold is 24 he's a pilot in the air force.</v>

263
00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:43.370
<v 10>Two strongest powers. All the two are the most dangerous. [inaudible]</v>

264
00:15:43.390 --> 00:15:45.850
<v 7>the Soviet capabilities are greatly increased.</v>

265
00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:52.340
<v 8>So signal means to stop whatever you are doing and get to the nearest safe place</v>

266
00:15:52.830 --> 00:15:52.890
back.

267
00:15:52.890 --> 00:15:56.640
<v 7>You get real anxieties. And so some of these anxieties bubble up in popular.</v>

268
00:15:56.670 --> 00:15:57.930
These are, these are kind of out there.

269
00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:02.880
<v 0>So long mom. Hi, I'm off to drop the bomb. So dog,</v>

270
00:16:02.881 --> 00:16:05.490
wake up for me. At this point. Popular culture

271
00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:08.510
<v 7>sure is saturated in nuclear fear.</v>

272
00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:11.010
<v 8>Firstly, it will be a white light that the blindness, but a hot flame,</v>

273
00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:16.000
middle burner. I don't want to die. People are building a bomb. Selten's and

274
00:16:16.450 --> 00:16:19.760
<v 0>the kids in classrooms are practicing, hiding under their desks,</v>

275
00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:23.130
<v 11>then covered this distance.</v>

276
00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:26.960
The heat wave is sufficient to cause melting of the upturn angle.

277
00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:32.510
<v 7>You have bombers flying from the United States and on these routes that take</v>

278
00:16:32.511 --> 00:16:37.130
them near the Soviet borders, and the problem is you put up a lot of bombers.

279
00:16:37.131 --> 00:16:38.450
It's only a matter of time before

280
00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:42.570
you'll expect one to crash or have a malfunction.

281
00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:45.790
<v 0>I'll be 52 Harry in hydrogen units,</v>

282
00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:46.700
<v 7>and so indeed,</v>

283
00:16:46.701 --> 00:16:51.701
there are a bunch of accidents where bombers crash with hydrogen bombs on board.

284
00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:55.130
They crash in Spain and drop hydrogen bombs.

285
00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:56.870
One of them gets dropped in Greenland,

286
00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:59.880
<v 0>fully air bait, Greenland. They crash in the United States</v>

287
00:16:59.970 --> 00:17:00.840
<v 7>numerous times.</v>

288
00:17:01.170 --> 00:17:04.340
There's one in the south where a bomb basically lands on somebody's house and

289
00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:04.770
atomic,

290
00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:07.920
<v 0>well atomic bomb. The atomic bomb landed on someone's house,</v>

291
00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:13.180
<v 8>bomb breaks loose from a mountain shackle and a B 47 jet on a farm in South</v>

292
00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:16.360
Carolina. How much to work? Six. What injury? The home of Walter.

293
00:17:16.361 --> 00:17:17.770
Greg was turned into what Shevon.

294
00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:21.730
<v 0>Yeah. Oh my God. That would be the most terrifying thing. Imagine you're right,</v>

295
00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:22.770
<v 7>just brushing your teeth.</v>

296
00:17:22.771 --> 00:17:26.670
And then Dominic bomb atomic bomb and there's a knock on the door and say,

297
00:17:26.671 --> 00:17:28.890
excuse me, uh, we're going to remove this.

298
00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:31.600
So there's all these accidents and on top of that,

299
00:17:31.601 --> 00:17:35.680
America is keeping a bunch of its bombs and bases all over the world and they

300
00:17:35.681 --> 00:17:40.150
start to worry that some of these bases are not American bases and there aren't

301
00:17:40.151 --> 00:17:42.280
that many Americans on them. So for instance,

302
00:17:42.281 --> 00:17:46.660
some nukes are kept at a base in Turkey, Turkey, Turkeys, our friend, right?

303
00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:50.220
Not a problem, but there were like two American guarding these things.

304
00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:51.930
They have the keys to turn these missiles on.

305
00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:54.930
What do you need to do if Turkey wants to become a nuclear power,

306
00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:58.170
they need to hit these guys over the head with a hammer and take the keys.

307
00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:01.050
Now Turkey is a nuclear power. Uh, whoa. Yeah,

308
00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:02.520
this is more or less what Kennedy says.

309
00:18:02.530 --> 00:18:06.010
<v 2>Yeah. So Kennedy actually has the exact same instinct that Truman did.</v>

310
00:18:06.050 --> 00:18:07.880
<v 7>He issues a directive which says,</v>

311
00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:11.900
no weapons can be kept overseas unless they have locks on them.

312
00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:14.480
And the first versions of these are very crude.

313
00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:17.720
They're like literally combination locks. Really like bike lock. Yeah.

314
00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:19.220
They're pretty simple. So you're,

315
00:18:19.221 --> 00:18:24.221
you're doing this technological enabling of this kind of vast political metaphor

316
00:18:24.531 --> 00:18:27.740
that the president is in control of these nuclear weapons at all times.

317
00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:33.290
<v 2>So it's like Truman wanted it close to the chest and then Eisenhower wanted it</v>

318
00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:39.320
out there. And then Kennedy now is pulling it back in. Right, exactly.

319
00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:42.730
At the time this felt safe.

320
00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:47.350
Who better to trust then the president with something so powerful you get in the

321
00:18:47.351 --> 00:18:49.780
world and even after Kennedy,

322
00:18:49.781 --> 00:18:54.490
the laws around this solidify the power stays with the president. Yes.

323
00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:56.870
But then you get this guy,

324
00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:59.540
people have got to note whether or not their president,

325
00:19:00.050 --> 00:19:05.050
Richard Milhous Nixon and this feeling of safety and really all trust in the

326
00:19:06.861 --> 00:19:09.200
presidency just starts to erode.

327
00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:14.210
<v 7>So in the last days of his presidency, there's the Watergate break in there.</v>

328
00:19:14.211 --> 00:19:16.160
All the investigations, uh,

329
00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:21.080
Nixon was drinking more than the president perhaps ought to.

330
00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:23.330
He was under an intense amount of stress.

331
00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:26.960
He did a few things that made people uncomfortable.

332
00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:27.290
<v 2>Well,</v>

333
00:19:27.290 --> 00:19:32.180
the most infamous moment like this happened in the summer of 1974 when all the

334
00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:34.760
Watergate stuff was really coming to a head.

335
00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:39.770
<v 7>He was talking with two congressman and he was trying to impress upon them what</v>

336
00:19:39.771 --> 00:19:43.010
a waste of time this quote little burglary was.

337
00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:45.920
And to give an example of how minor this was,

338
00:19:45.921 --> 00:19:49.580
he explained that his responsibilities were huge. If he wanted to,

339
00:19:49.581 --> 00:19:54.080
he could go into the other room and pick up a telephone and in 20 minutes 60

340
00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:57.230
million people would be dead. Hello. He said this, he said this

341
00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:02.180
<v 2>and that's exactly the kind of situation Harold was thinking about when he asked</v>

342
00:20:02.181 --> 00:20:05.990
his question. Like since I'm the guy with my hand on the key,

343
00:20:05.991 --> 00:20:07.070
just kind of curious here,

344
00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:11.270
is there a system for making sure a president doesn't just walk into the other

345
00:20:11.271 --> 00:20:14.510
room, pick up the phone and order me to kill 60 million people?

346
00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:19.680
<v 7>There is presently a degree of doubt in my mind.</v>

347
00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:24.070
<v 2>So he asks this question first out loud, then he does it in writing</v>

348
00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:27.540
<v 7>and then I was pulled out of training, uh,</v>

349
00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:30.510
unequal for about six days before graduation. Yeah.

350
00:20:30.570 --> 00:20:35.490
<v 2>That leads to a series of meetings with superior officers where they basically</v>

351
00:20:35.491 --> 00:20:36.100
tell him

352
00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:39.970
<v 7>that I need to have more, uh, faith in our leaders, you know,</v>

353
00:20:39.971 --> 00:20:44.590
not to question them. And uh, I was told that I didn't have a need to know. So

354
00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:48.070
<v 2>that leads to a trial where has this one</v>

355
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:50.620
<v 1>meeting with this military judge who basically says, here,</v>

356
00:20:50.621 --> 00:20:53.770
I have your question in my hand, I will tear it up and we will,

357
00:20:53.771 --> 00:20:55.390
can all forget this ever happened.

358
00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:59.830
But I still wanted the question answered and then that leads to appeals and he's

359
00:20:59.831 --> 00:21:00.790
writing letters.

360
00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:05.560
I would spend days and nights virtually continuously writing to congressmen,

361
00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:07.600
writing and writing to the president,

362
00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:12.040
but it really didn't matter at all what I had to say at that point.

363
00:21:12.041 --> 00:21:16.300
He's basically like, okay, fine. I don't want to be a launch officer anymore.

364
00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:21.190
I asked a B, you know, reassigned if they weren't going to give the information.

365
00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:22.990
But instead of reassigning him,

366
00:21:23.150 --> 00:21:26.510
my promotional lieutenant colonel was withheld.

367
00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:31.670
I was removed from flight status, so I'd no longer would get flight pay.

368
00:21:32.270 --> 00:21:36.920
I was then permanently disqualified from the human reliability program.

369
00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:39.140
And along with that,

370
00:21:39.141 --> 00:21:43.640
my top secret security clearance was taken away from me.

371
00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:48.260
And once you have a security clearance removed and you're permanently

372
00:21:48.261 --> 00:21:51.260
disqualify, there's no hope for your career.

373
00:21:52.670 --> 00:21:57.670
I pursued every avenue available to me to have my military record corrected and

374
00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:05.930
to have the findings reversed and to remain in the air force.

375
00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:11.350
Only after I exhausted all of my appeals was I ordered to be,

376
00:22:12.290 --> 00:22:14.150
uh, uh, retired.

377
00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:19.780
<v 6>What w I, oh, I don't, why, why? I mean,</v>

378
00:22:19.781 --> 00:22:22.920
I know that like the, the whole military thing, you got to stay in your lane.

379
00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:25.690
You don't question your superiors, but why would they,

380
00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:30.340
what's [inaudible] ask the question? Why? Why would they, why?

381
00:22:30.341 --> 00:22:33.220
What's wrong with him asking the question? Why is it such a threat?

382
00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:35.800
<v 12>Well, I'll tell you right after we take a break.</v>

Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich, Radiolab.

406
00:24:06.521 --> 00:24:09.460
And so lots of why was Harold's question such a threat? Yeah. Well,

407
00:24:09.490 --> 00:24:12.910
here's how it was put to me. You know, the other side has to know.

408
00:24:12.911 --> 00:24:16.630
The only reason, the only way that, let me, let me phrase it this way. Sure.

409
00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:18.960
The whole, the whole premise is deterrence.

410
00:24:19.570 --> 00:24:24.570
That has been our founding philosophy since we developed these things.

411
00:24:25.030 --> 00:24:29.020
This is Dr Sonja McMullin and I'm a former air force missile ear.

412
00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:34.350
She had her hand on the nuclear keys from 1997 to 2001 and by deterrence,

413
00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:40.050
<v 14>she means there is only world peace where there was power to preserve order</v>

414
00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:43.020
among nations. We keep other countries from nuking.

415
00:24:43.021 --> 00:24:48.021
US [inaudible] represent a shield by making clear that if they do the missiles

416
00:24:48.330 --> 00:24:49.290
are ready, we'll need

417
00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:52.440
<v 4>come right back.</v>

418
00:24:55.330 --> 00:24:59.590
<v 0>But if the other side doesn't believe that you will respond in kind,</v>

419
00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:03.310
then it doesn't work. You have to believe my threat is legit.

420
00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:07.000
I have to be credible. So if you're the guy whose hand is on the key,

421
00:25:07.001 --> 00:25:10.780
when the order comes down to launch, there can't be any doubt that you will do.

422
00:25:10.810 --> 00:25:12.820
What you are ordered to do. Exactly.

423
00:25:12.850 --> 00:25:14.920
So the problem with somebody like Harold is that you're in,

424
00:25:14.921 --> 00:25:19.330
if you start allowing people to at the bottom to start making up their mind,

425
00:25:19.870 --> 00:25:24.040
then it's not a credible threat because you understand in your own mind why they

426
00:25:24.041 --> 00:25:29.041
had to have a committee to sit in judgment on him and review some sort of

427
00:25:30.610 --> 00:25:34.450
factoring. I don't know what I'm in hardly, no, I haven't seen their side of it.

428
00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:38.980
I'm filing to get access to that side. We'll see how that goes.

429
00:25:39.610 --> 00:25:42.490
So I found this, I actually just, we got this this morning,

430
00:25:42.491 --> 00:25:46.480
so we actually ended up finding a statement by the commander in Chief of

431
00:25:46.481 --> 00:25:50.050
Strategic Air Command, uh, General Russ Dougherty.

432
00:25:50.170 --> 00:25:53.980
I don't know if you have seen it, Harold, but it's going to be fair.

433
00:25:53.981 --> 00:25:56.860
We thought we should let Harold respond to it. Uh,

434
00:25:56.870 --> 00:26:01.300
do you know what I'm talking about? Uh, no, but he was the, uh, thing.

435
00:26:01.301 --> 00:26:04.750
Sac Commander, chief of strategic air command. Right, right, right.

436
00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:07.360
And so let me just read to you what he said. Sure. Um,

437
00:26:08.110 --> 00:26:12.520
the major's hesitation initiated extensive hearings and administrative

438
00:26:12.521 --> 00:26:13.354
procedures.

439
00:26:13.570 --> 00:26:17.710
Later he professed that he really would turn keys and that his hesitation had

440
00:26:17.711 --> 00:26:18.670
been misunderstood.

441
00:26:19.150 --> 00:26:23.500
I examined the record thoroughly and discovered that for a fact he had repeated

442
00:26:23.501 --> 00:26:26.710
several times in the records that he would readily turn keys.

443
00:26:27.050 --> 00:26:28.330
But then in each instance,

444
00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:33.360
his affirmative assertion was followed immediately by a personal subjective

445
00:26:33.791 --> 00:26:35.440
qualification. Yes,

446
00:26:35.441 --> 00:26:40.150
he would turn keys upon receipt of an authentic order from proper authority if

447
00:26:40.151 --> 00:26:41.740
he thought the order was legal,

448
00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:45.780
if he thought the necessitated an ICBM launch,

449
00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:49.710
if he was convinced that it was a rational moral necessity and so on,

450
00:26:50.130 --> 00:26:53.940
every affirmative answer was qualified by a subjective condition.

451
00:26:54.070 --> 00:26:58.660
<v 1>No, no, no, no. I did not say that anywhere.</v>

452
00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:03.040
No. Where did I say that? Nowhere did I use those words

453
00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:09.450
and I'm sorry, but that's just, that's just false. Uh,

454
00:27:09.490 --> 00:27:10.510
that doesn't surprise me.

455
00:27:10.690 --> 00:27:11.770
<v 0>According to herald,</v>

456
00:27:11.771 --> 00:27:14.650
he never wanted to doubt an order coming from the president.

457
00:27:14.790 --> 00:27:19.790
<v 1>I assumed that there had to be some sort of check and balance,</v>

458
00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:26.210
so that one man couldn't just on a whim order to launch a nuclear weapon.

459
00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:32.600
<v 0>He just wanted to be told that something like that existed so that he and his</v>

460
00:27:33.091 --> 00:27:36.780
fellow launch officers would not have to have a conflict of conscience.

461
00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:41.820
<v 1>And that we not put anybody in a position where they're just following orders,</v>

462
00:27:44.170 --> 00:27:46.990
uh, and throwing our conscious to the four winds.

463
00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:52.080
I think it's in a front to play the game of you don't have the need to know,

464
00:27:53.770 --> 00:27:58.180
uh, of someone that's doing one of the most serious, uh,

465
00:27:58.210 --> 00:28:01.750
grave jobs that there is in the armed forces.

466
00:28:02.710 --> 00:28:07.480
<v 0>And so since periled never got an answer to his question,</v>

467
00:28:07.930 --> 00:28:12.150
we decided to make it our question where,

468
00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:15.440
<v 7>where do you get somebody who's allowed to question the president?</v>

469
00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:17.570
Because we know that by the time you get to the bottom,

470
00:28:17.770 --> 00:28:20.210
there's no way that that's possible. So what about the guy above them?

471
00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:22.940
Let's say there's a, an officer who's one more up the tier.

472
00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:25.520
Is he gonna question the order? Well, I don't know.

473
00:28:25.521 --> 00:28:28.550
He's getting it from the generals who coordinate all of the nuclear attacks.

474
00:28:28.610 --> 00:28:31.040
If it got to him, it must be a legitimate order, right?

475
00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:36.200
Maybe those top level major heads of the military branches. Maybe they get to,

476
00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:39.710
I don't know. And so my question is where if anywhere,

477
00:28:39.711 --> 00:28:43.580
if the president issues an order, can they, will they say no?

478
00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:49.960
<v 0>After a lot of digging around, Alex says that he thinks,</v>

479
00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:53.440
my guess is you're not allowed to question the president more than a couple

480
00:28:53.441 --> 00:28:54.970
steps down from the very top.

481
00:28:55.150 --> 00:28:56.800
If you're allowed the question of the president at all,

482
00:28:56.801 --> 00:28:58.450
maybe the secretary of defense can do it.

483
00:28:58.540 --> 00:29:01.960
And when we talked to Sonia McMullin our missile here,

484
00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:06.940
she also thought that the secretary of defense could probably provide a check.

485
00:29:06.970 --> 00:29:11.110
The secretary of defense is the, is the first person to say, hey, let's,

486
00:29:11.111 --> 00:29:15.970
let's think about this. Let's think about this in detail. All right,

487
00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:19.600
we're ready. Okay. Um, this is Bill Perry,

488
00:29:20.530 --> 00:29:23.890
formally secretary of Defense 19 sector. I defend to the United State.

489
00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:27.580
So we decided to ask an actual secretary of Defense,

490
00:29:27.730 --> 00:29:30.760
William Perry served under President Clinton, uh,

491
00:29:30.790 --> 00:29:33.640
from 1994 to 1997. Yeah.

492
00:29:33.790 --> 00:29:38.320
Let's just pretend for a moment that the president issues you and order that you

493
00:29:38.321 --> 00:29:41.980
disagree with because you don't think the president is of mind or

494
00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:44.230
<v 15>sober or whatever.</v>

495
00:29:45.070 --> 00:29:48.430
What authority do you have a secretary of defense, if any? Well,

496
00:29:49.150 --> 00:29:53.800
the system is set up show that only the president has the authority to order a

497
00:29:53.801 --> 00:29:57.880
nuclear war. Nobody has the right to count a man that decision.

498
00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:03.300
He might choose to call the secretary of defense or the secretary of state or

499
00:30:03.851 --> 00:30:08.020
the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to get his advisors council,

500
00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:12.940
but he, even if he does that, he may, he may or may not accept that counsel.

501
00:30:13.270 --> 00:30:16.630
If you as secretary of defense say to the president, he says,

502
00:30:16.660 --> 00:30:21.360
let's go and you say, let's not, can you vote if he calls me? Yeah.

503
00:30:21.430 --> 00:30:25.330
And then if I say that Mr President, that would be a very serious mistake.

504
00:30:25.331 --> 00:30:28.720
Don't do that. He might or might not accept my advice.

505
00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:32.410
Are you necessary to launch? No. No.

506
00:30:33.090 --> 00:30:36.520
Suppose everybody in the room thought that it was a bad idea.

507
00:30:36.550 --> 00:30:39.670
Would he still be able to do it? Yes, he has.

508
00:30:39.671 --> 00:30:44.671
The call directly to the strategic air command to do the launching and they will

509
00:30:46.961 --> 00:30:48.370
respond to his orders.

510
00:30:49.090 --> 00:30:52.330
They don't call the secretary of defense or the chairman at and say,

511
00:30:52.331 --> 00:30:54.520
should I do this? They do it.

512
00:30:56.780 --> 00:30:57.370
<v 16>[inaudible]</v>

513
00:30:57.370 --> 00:31:00.040
<v 17>yeah, so in our training we are conditioned,</v>

514
00:31:00.310 --> 00:31:02.680
almost like a Pavlovian talk.

515
00:31:02.790 --> 00:31:04.350
<v 2>This is Dr. Bruce Blair.</v>

516
00:31:04.351 --> 00:31:09.120
He was a missile launch officer at the exact time that Harold was training to

517
00:31:09.121 --> 00:31:13.560
become one and ever since then he basically spent the whole rest of his career

518
00:31:13.561 --> 00:31:16.320
studying nuclear command and control.

519
00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:21.130
<v 17>I wrote studies so classified that the Pentagon demanded that I not be allowed</v>

520
00:31:21.131 --> 00:31:22.120
to read them anymore.

521
00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:26.180
<v 2>And we asked him like, why does it work like this?</v>

522
00:31:26.210 --> 00:31:28.330
Why would we give one person that much?

523
00:31:28.770 --> 00:31:32.100
<v 17>It's always been set. It's always been set up that way. And that be what,</v>

524
00:31:32.101 --> 00:31:36.570
what's the re why did it came out of the Cold War from you know,

525
00:31:36.571 --> 00:31:38.790
in the 1960s I don't know.

526
00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:43.630
<v 2>By the 1960s the U s and the Soviet Union were building ICBM switch,</v>

527
00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:47.790
which these nuclear missiles that could go from a silo in one country to a

528
00:31:47.791 --> 00:31:50.370
target. In the other in the matter of minutes.

529
00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:54.210
So if the Soviets ever launched their missiles at us,

530
00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:55.860
<v 17>if we're under attack missile attack,</v>

531
00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:58.530
there's very little time to assess the attack,

532
00:31:58.710 --> 00:32:01.710
to brief the president on his options

533
00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:05.830
<v 2>because the assumption was that the Soviets would target our missiles,</v>

534
00:32:06.020 --> 00:32:09.200
<v 15>R I c BMS, and they will be the first to go.</v>

535
00:32:09.201 --> 00:32:14.201
And so therefore the president has to decide whether to launch or ICB m's before

536
00:32:14.961 --> 00:32:16.130
the other measures. Land

537
00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:20.930
<v 17>for any incoming missiles could destroy the command and control system.</v>

538
00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:26.630
And that forces the president to make a decision on how to respond immediately

539
00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:29.590
because missiles are flying in at four miles per second.

540
00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:33.210
<v 15>Yeah, it's about six or seven minutes to make that decision. Oh,</v>

541
00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:37.090
<v 17>six minutes. The dish decision process just is too short</v>

542
00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:40.070
<v 2>or any kind of thoughtful or serious</v>

543
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:40.800
<v 0>deliberation</v>

544
00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:42.390
<v 17>and the pressure is intense.</v>

545
00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:47.520
And there I think you would find that different presidents would respond

546
00:32:47.521 --> 00:32:50.160
differently and their character, their temperament.

547
00:32:50.670 --> 00:32:55.670
Are they thinking people or are they intuitive people who respond instinctively?

548
00:32:56.911 --> 00:32:58.680
And so, you know,

549
00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:03.960
you see a lot of variation in the way presidents react to a nuclear emergency.

550
00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:10.300
<v 12>The pres of the United States now for 50 years is followed at all times,</v>

551
00:33:10.301 --> 00:33:15.040
24 hours a day by a military aide carrying a football. Then Vice President,

552
00:33:15.041 --> 00:33:15.910
Dick Cheney,

553
00:33:15.911 --> 00:33:20.911
also a former secretary of defense talking on Fox News Sunday back in 2008 he

554
00:33:21.161 --> 00:33:24.610
could launch kind of a devastating attack. The world's never seen.

555
00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:27.970
He doesn't have to check with anybody. He doesn't have to call the congress.

556
00:33:27.971 --> 00:33:29.410
He doesn't have to check with the courts.

557
00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:32.860
He has that authority because of the nature of the world we live in.

558
00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:41.240
<v 17>It bothers me immensely that,</v>

559
00:33:41.290 --> 00:33:46.290
that the only area that there is not a check and balance is the one that can

560
00:33:46.611 --> 00:33:50.630
literally result in the end of the world. That seems strange to me.

561
00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:51.980
Have you thought about that?

562
00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:55.200
<v 0>This would all, and wondered whether there's a better way to do</v>

563
00:33:55.350 --> 00:33:58.340
<v 15>do this? Yes, I have. Yeah. What would you suggest? Um,</v>

564
00:33:58.550 --> 00:34:03.200
I have specifically proposed and continued to propose on successfully, again,

565
00:34:03.201 --> 00:34:06.380
former secretary of defense, William Perry, that we phase out our,

566
00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:10.040
it IBM's and to the extent you have to have a nuclear deterrence.

567
00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:15.380
We limited the submarines and airplanes because they don't have to launch in

568
00:34:15.381 --> 00:34:17.240
five minutes or six minutes or seven minutes.

569
00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:20.900
And when it comes to preemptive strikes, he says, we have before the congress,

570
00:34:20.901 --> 00:34:24.950
now a bill making a modification, which says the less,

571
00:34:25.070 --> 00:34:30.070
unless the United States has been verifiably attacked than the president has

572
00:34:31.191 --> 00:34:36.191
before he launches his nuclear weapons has to go to Congress for permission.

573
00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:38.300
<v 0>So our, our bill is very simple.</v>

574
00:34:38.450 --> 00:34:42.560
This is congressman Ted lieu and he and Senator Ed Markey are the guys who

575
00:34:42.561 --> 00:34:47.561
authored the bill basically says before the president can launch a nuclear first

576
00:34:47.841 --> 00:34:51.440
strike, the president must first get a declaration of war from Congress.

577
00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:56.570
I believe that you introduced this bill before the election.

578
00:34:56.600 --> 00:34:58.570
Is that right? Absolutely. Uh,

579
00:34:58.850 --> 00:35:02.030
senator mark and I believe we need a structural fix. Um,

580
00:35:02.270 --> 00:35:05.000
we believe ashy Hillary Clinton was going to be precedent.

581
00:35:05.010 --> 00:35:08.120
So this bill would have applied to her.

582
00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:13.600
And that's because the fate of humanity in our world should not rest on one

583
00:35:13.881 --> 00:35:18.320
person. And wait, so are you seeing this as just as you sizing this up?

584
00:35:18.321 --> 00:35:23.300
Is this a systemic problem or is this a problem with one person who just happens

585
00:35:23.301 --> 00:35:24.260
to have the office right now?

586
00:35:24.350 --> 00:35:28.910
It's absolutely a systemic problem and it's also a problem with the current

587
00:35:28.911 --> 00:35:33.800
person in the office of the president. But you can see future presidents, right?

588
00:35:33.830 --> 00:35:38.130
That could be elected with judgment or temperament issues. Or maybe

589
00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:43.320
<v 19>they simply go to advanced age and get Alzheimer's, right?</v>

590
00:35:43.321 --> 00:35:46.680
Or, or some other, uh, sort of, uh, issue.

591
00:35:46.890 --> 00:35:51.890
That's why we can't have a system where there's so little checks and balances.

592
00:35:53.310 --> 00:35:54.480
Do you know about this bill or

593
00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:58.920
<v 20>have you heard of, no, actually I don't. Um, and I that's, that's interesting.</v>

594
00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:01.800
That is a very interesting bill. Um,

595
00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:07.410
that, uh, let me, let, let me say it this way. Yeah.

596
00:36:09.450 --> 00:36:14.280
On one hand I agree. Um, because again,

597
00:36:14.281 --> 00:36:18.750
I always like to have checks and balances. Yeah. On the other hand,

598
00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:21.780
uh, I also think that it,

599
00:36:22.890 --> 00:36:26.400
it says to a potential adversary,

600
00:36:27.930 --> 00:36:32.370
um, you know, now there's doubt.

601
00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:36.620
<v 13>So there are two sides of values here. One is, uh,</v>

602
00:36:37.310 --> 00:36:42.310
your humane interest in making sure that the end of the world,

603
00:36:42.531 --> 00:36:47.210
if it comes to that, uh, is happening for a good reason and, uh,

604
00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:49.490
and adjust reason as best you can define it.

605
00:36:50.090 --> 00:36:55.090
And the ongoing hope that by making this system credible that the we will never

606
00:36:56.781 --> 00:37:01.340
have in of the world. So my question to you is like,

607
00:37:01.341 --> 00:37:02.420
how do you weigh those?

608
00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:07.710
<v 20>Hmm. Yeah. Well, and it's,</v>

609
00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:11.700
that's a dilemma. Yeah. You know, that's a dilemma.

610
00:37:16.910 --> 00:37:17.743
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

611
00:37:36.030 --> 00:37:36.120
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

612
00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:39.510
<v 2>so after the military forced Harold to retire,</v>

613
00:37:39.511 --> 00:37:41.460
he became a truck driver.

614
00:37:41.970 --> 00:37:43.830
<v 1>And once I got that job,</v>

615
00:37:43.831 --> 00:37:48.720
I made up my mind that I was going to devote my time to making a living for my

616
00:37:48.721 --> 00:37:53.721
family into that company and I wasn't going to be off dealing with this subject

617
00:37:53.761 --> 00:37:54.500
anymore.

618
00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:59.500
<v 2>And eventually he started doing addiction counseling at the Salvation Army,</v>

619
00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:02.720
mostly with homeless people. How, how,

620
00:38:02.721 --> 00:38:06.890
what's your sort of emotional state around all this right now? Like,

621
00:38:06.891 --> 00:38:10.790
how often is this something you still think about? How, what do you,

622
00:38:10.791 --> 00:38:11.810
how do you feel right now?

623
00:38:12.170 --> 00:38:15.620
<v 1>Okay. Well, I'm, uh, I'm just,</v>

624
00:38:17.660 --> 00:38:21.770
I just, I, I think that common sense,

625
00:38:21.771 --> 00:38:26.750
I think the goodness in human beings, uh,

626
00:38:28.190 --> 00:38:31.220
begs for a resolution of death.

627
00:38:31.790 --> 00:38:36.790
I just think that the need for that is at least as great now as it's ever been

628
00:38:40.391 --> 00:38:41.980
in the history of our republic.

629
00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:47.670
And I might add on a personal level that, uh, I had,

630
00:38:48.410 --> 00:38:52.810
I mean, I was really, uh, committed to the military, to the air force,

631
00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:57.420
uh, volunteered several times, you know, to, to do my duty, uh,

632
00:38:58.090 --> 00:39:00.730
with respect to the Vietnam war. And, uh,

633
00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:05.760
I just felt that I had asked a very reasonable question that deserved an answer.

634
00:39:07.961 --> 00:39:11.990
And, and it was not for me alone.

635
00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:14.320
And it was for all of us.

636
00:39:24.260 --> 00:39:25.150
<v 4>[inaudible] Western Hemisphere</v>

637
00:39:46.610 --> 00:39:47.443
