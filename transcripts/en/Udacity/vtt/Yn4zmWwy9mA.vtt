00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.260
&gt;&gt; All right, the next concept that we're going to

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:03.530
need to understand the folk theorem is the notion

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:06.810
of a minmax profile. So a minmax profile is

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.390
going to be a pair of payoffs, one for each

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:11.880
player. And the value for player represents the payoffs

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.040
that that player can achieve by defending itself from

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.630
a malicious adversary. So what do you suppose a

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.940
malicious adversary would mean in a game theory context?

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.400
&gt;&gt; Someone who's desperately trying to hurt you.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.770
&gt;&gt; And what does hurt mean?

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:25.340
&gt;&gt; Gives

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:26.120
you the lowest score.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:30.330
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and what does that remind you of from your lesson?

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.190
&gt;&gt; My grad students.

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:32.530
&gt;&gt; You think they're malicious?

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:34.070
&gt;&gt; It would explain a few things.

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:35.660
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't think they're malicious.

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:36.390
&gt;&gt; They're sweet.

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.760
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.770
Yeah, I know a lot of them and they're, they're wonderful people.

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:43.580
&gt;&gt; Well, what it reminds me of is, they

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.240
are wonderful people. It reminds me of zero-sum games.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:50.380
&gt;&gt; Exactly. So you can imagine thinking about the game

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.410
that we're playing, now, no longer as being I get my payoff and

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.360
you get yours, but I get my payoff and you get the negative of

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.030
my payoff. So you don't, you don't really care about yourself anymore. All you

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.550
care about is hurting me. And that's, that's the idea of a malicious adversary.

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.160
&gt;&gt; I have some ex-girlfriends like that.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.290
&gt;&gt; I'm so. Oh. [LAUGH].

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.960
It is. People do get into this mode sometimes. And that,

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.780
that's actually going to be important in understanding the folk there.

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:13.750
&gt;&gt; Hmm.

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.910
&gt;&gt; So what

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:19.840
I'd like to do is figure out what the min-max profile is for this game. So this

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.680
is a very famous Game theory, game example.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.680
Sometimes goes by the name battle of the sexes.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.970
&gt;&gt; That what the b and the s stand for?

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.410
&gt;&gt; Sometimes it stands for Bach and Stravinsky.

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:31.430
&gt;&gt; Blech.

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.160
&gt;&gt; Those are like composers, I think.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.650
&gt;&gt; You mean like the Backstreet Boys and Sting.

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.820
&gt;&gt; Ahh. Alright, that works for me. So,

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.860
so, let me explain this story. It turns out that

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.140
Smooth and Curly actually got away, they didn't make any kind

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.800
of deal, they actually just figured out a way of

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.840
escaping from the jail. So they're, they're back out on the

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.500
streets again, and they decided that they'd like to celebrate

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.140
their freedom by going out to see a concert. And they

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.235
both decided that in advance, but what they didn't know was

00:02:03.235 --> 00:02:05.718
which concerts were available. Once they escaped out into the world,

00:02:05.718 --> 00:02:07.580
they couldn't communicate with each other, they

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.270
discovered that there's in fact two concerts

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.520
in the city that night. The Backstreet Boys are playing, and Sting is playing.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:14.460
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.500
&gt;&gt; Now as it turns out, each of them is now going

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.380
to have to choose, whether to go to the concert with Backstreet

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.140
Boys or Sting, and they're choosing independently. Now, if they end up

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.740
going to different concert's they're both going to be unhappy and get zero's.

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.340
&gt;&gt; I see.

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.470
&gt;&gt; If they end up at the same concert, then they're going to be happier,

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.800
but in fact, as it turns out, Smooth really likes

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.870
the Backstreet Boys and would prefer that they both end up

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.500
at the Backstreet Boy concert. But Curly really likes Sting

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.150
and would prefer that they end up at the Sting Concert.

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:45.320
&gt;&gt; That's not realistic.

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:46.730
&gt;&gt; Which part?

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.110
&gt;&gt; The fact that I prefer the Backstreet Boys to Sting.

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.220
&gt;&gt; What, what do you mean you? I mean this is Smooth. He's a criminal.

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.340
&gt;&gt; Mm, that's a fine point that you

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.460
make there. There is no connection between these

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.000
characters and ourselves.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.730
&gt;&gt; Real life characters, living, dead

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.570
or fictional, or mathematical, or instructional.

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:04.390
&gt;&gt; If so, otherwise purely coincidental.

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.370
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I could switch these around if you'd prefer.

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.428
&gt;&gt; No, no. I'll go with your fantasy.

00:03:09.428 --> 00:03:14.510
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right. I, yeah, I think that payoff matrix may look

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.620
something like we both have twos in, in the s, the same place.

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.680
&gt;&gt; Mhm.

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.520
&gt;&gt; But anyway, but let's say for the purposes of this example,

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.190
there's a little bit of a disagreement. Okay, so now what we

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.610
need to figure out is what the minmax profile is for this game.

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.890
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.080
&gt;&gt; Alright, so that's going to be a pair of numbers.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.130
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.270
&gt;&gt; One number corresponds to the payoff for Curly and one number

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:37.740
corresponds to the payoff for Smooth. And it should be, the payoff

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:42.510
for Curly should be the payoff that Curly can guarantee himself even

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.480
if Smooth is trying to get him to have a low score.

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:46.790
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.390
&gt;&gt; And vice versa. Smooth's score is going to be the score that it

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:52.760
can guarantee, he can guarantee himself even

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.590
if Curly is trying to minimize Smooth's score.

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:55.380
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.050
&gt;&gt; So let's do this as a quiz. So,I want you

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:01.290
to find the min-max profile for this game, this Bach, Stravinsky

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.440
game or Backstreet, Sting game, and put the, the number for

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.420
Curly in the first box and Smooth in the second box.

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.940
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:08.750
&gt;&gt; Go.
