00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:06.930
The recent reigning Queen of everything, once
said “If you like it, then you shoulda put

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.490
a ring on it”, well I like the Earth, why
wasn’t a ring put on it?

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:17.510
Hey everyone, Julia here for Dnews.

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:22.130
A researcher from the University of Rochester,
Eric Mamajek, recently took another look at

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.410
some odd readings from a star 420 million
light years from Earth.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:30.590
The starlight emanating from the faraway solar
system seemed to dim frequently indicating

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:32.570
a planet passing in front of it.

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.750
In most cases like this, the dimming lasts
a few hours, however this star’s dimming

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.850
was lasting a few months.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.000
His interpretation?

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.640
A scaled up version of Saturn.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.899
A big planet with HUGE RINGS.

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:46.780
This planet would be about 10-40 times the
size of Jupiter.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:47.780
Its rings?

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:48.780
EVEN BIGGER.

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.960
If they exist, they would span the width of
here to the sun.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.750
That’s 93 million miles.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.070
It’s so big, it leaves many scientists skeptical.

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.990
So while they still puzzle over that mystery,
let’s take a look at why planetary rings

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.990
form at all.

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:05.700
Four of the planets in our solar system have
rings, the gas giants, Jupiter and Saturn,

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.490
and the ice giants Uranus and Neptune.

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.649
Their rings aren’t a giant solid disk, they’re
a bunch of smaller rings made up of smaller

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:14.149
particles, like bits of rock and dust and
even ice.

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:17.889
Saturn’s big ring is made up of thousands
of smaller wide rings of ice that reflect

00:01:17.889 --> 00:01:22.409
a lot of sunlight, so they’re super visible
to us on Earth, I mean with a telescope of

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.409
course.

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:26.020
Galileo first discovered Saturn’s rings
in 1610.

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.159
Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune’s rings are
thin and dusty, so they’re not as visible

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:32.880
to us and took a little longer to find.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.479
Jupiter’s rings weren’t discovered until
1979 by the Voyager 1 space probe and Neptune’s

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:42.319
weren’t found until a decade later, by the
Voyager 2 space probe.

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:46.100
Planetary rings form in a few ways: Possibly
in the early days when the planets were forming

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.420
from a mass of space dust, this debris never
made it into the final planet, so it just

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:51.939
kind of hangs out in orbit.

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:56.210
Or the rings might form when planetary satellites,
like a moon, get too close and get pulled

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:57.950
apart by the planet’s gravity.

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.380
These two theories could explain Saturn’s
rings.

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.289
Most of the other planet’s dusty, thin rings
formed when their moons were hit by something

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:06.560
and that impact kicked up dust and particles.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.200
The earth had a ring too once.

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.000
It just coalesced into the moon.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.840
So why don’t Saturn’s rings turn into
a moon?

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:12.840
The rings are simply too close to the planet.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.750
They are within what is called The Roche Limit
named after a French astronomer, Edouard Roche,

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.260
who calculated this theoretical limit in 1848.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.500
Inside the limit, the debris remains as rings.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.830
Outside of the limit, debris coalesces into
larger bodies, like a moon.

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.140
When a satellite, like a moon, gets too close
to the planet and it can’t withstand the

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.700
tidal forces caused by the planet’s gravity,
it disintegrates.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.720
Our moon is out side of the Earth’s Roche
limit, so it remains spherical.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.140
But what if it fell into the Roche Limit?

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.030
What if the Earth had rings like Saturn?

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.720
It would look pretty awesome, something like
this.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.060
What do you think?

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.950
how cool would it be if earth had rings?
