00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.540
I have a huge scar on my spine and two on
my abdomen, but whenever I spend time in the

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:12.240
Sun they turn bright red, and I’ve always
wondered why?

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.630
Hello everyone, proud scar owner Amy with
you on DNews today!

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.260
Scars are our body’s way of recovering from
trauma.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.620
Whenever body tissue is broken, it heals itself
by producing more collagen to fix the damage.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:27.360
For about three months, this process draws
more blood to the area, which is why scars

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.100
start red, and eventually fade to pale.

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.410
In the end, the new tissue heals into a scar,
and you're left with a permanent reminder

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.800
of whatever happened on that one night in
Vegas.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.390
But why do scars not look like the rest of
your skin?

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.540
Our individual skin colour is determined by
a pigment called melanin.

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.750
It’s made by specialized cells in our skin
called melanocytes, in organelles called melanosomes.

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.120
The type and amount of melanin gives skin
its individual colour: more melanin, darker

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.809
color, less, lighter.

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:56.350
The amount of melanin is dependent on your
ethnicity, environment, and hormone levels.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.230
But, it can also change with exposure to the
UV radiation in sunlight.

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.320
Tanning, which we’ve discussed before, is
the skin’s way of protecting itself against

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.620
ultraviolet light.

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.941
Certain skin cells produce more melanin the
longer you spend in the Sun.

00:01:08.941 --> 00:01:13.190
The darker pigment absorbs UV radiation so
it can't penetrate the skin any further, which

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.460
sounds great except that too much radiation
damages the skin causing what we know as a

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.460
sun burn.

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.659
The thing is… scar tissue doesn't do this!

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:23.330
Scar tissue doesn’t have melanin, so doesn’t
have pigment!

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.240
The reason why is actually a bit of a mystery
to scientists.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.090
But one study I found in the Indian Journal
of Plastic Surgery suggests that the availability

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.680
of melanocytes to repigment scarred skin depends
on the mechanism of the injury.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.960
Superficial injuries retain the cells adjacent
to the wounded area, but deep cuts destroy

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.479
more elements, meaning the only available
source for melanocytes are the wound’s edges.

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:47.390
So, deeper injuries take longer to heal and
end up with a lighter, melanin-free center

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.400
compared to the surrounding skin.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.770
And because they lack melanin, the cells that
form scars can’t produce more of it!

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.510
So when a scar is exposed to sunlight, it
just can’t tan.

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.751
And this doesn’t only make the scar stand
out more, it also puts the scar owner at an

00:02:00.751 --> 00:02:03.320
increased risk of UV-related skin damage!

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.820
I’ve noticed this myself.

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.380
My scars turn red really fast if I don't put
sunscreen on them.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:09.690
Another odd thing about scars?

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.270
They're typically hairless.

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.030
And like a lack of pigment, this has to do
with how damaged the skin is.

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.900
Hair grows from the papilla, the living part
of the hair follicle inside the skin.

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.700
When the skin is damaged deeply enough to
disrupt the follicle, the hair can’t grow.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.950
So, scars don't tan and don't grow hair, but
why are some more visible than others?

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.020
Skin cells grow in specific directions in
different parts of your body.

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.041
A cut made with the grain will heal into a
much thinner scar than one made against the

00:02:35.041 --> 00:02:36.041
grain.

00:02:36.041 --> 00:02:40.239
What all this boils down to is that scars,
for a lot of people, are unsightly and make

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:44.420
them feel ugly, but they’re really evidence
of how incredible our bodies are at taking

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:45.780
care of themselves.

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.860
Speaking of scars, did you guys know Al Bean
got smacked in the head with a camera when

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.200
Apollo 12 splashed down and ended up with
a nice little scar on his forehead?

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.350
True story, and that’s not the weirdest
space fact I could throw at you!

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.810

to America’s Moonshot!

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.220
My scars came from surgeries after a car accident
when I was a kid, and I wear them proud!

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:25.370
