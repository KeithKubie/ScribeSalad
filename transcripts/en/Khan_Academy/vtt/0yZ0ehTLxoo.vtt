00:00:00.208 --> 00:00:01.310
- [Voiceover] Hello grammarians.

00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:02.847
In this video I'm going to tell you about

00:00:02.847 --> 00:00:05.385
a piece of punctuation called the colon.

00:00:05.385 --> 00:00:07.187
The colon is these two
little dots right here,

00:00:07.187 --> 00:00:08.887
one stacked on top of the other.

00:00:08.887 --> 00:00:10.596
And it has quite a few functions,

00:00:10.596 --> 00:00:13.418
just like a lot of other
pieces of punctuation.

00:00:13.418 --> 00:00:16.432
The idea of this linking function
is that the colon can link

00:00:16.432 --> 00:00:18.299
an independent or dependent clause

00:00:18.299 --> 00:00:20.993
with another independent
or dependent clause,

00:00:20.993 --> 00:00:23.923
or a phrase, or a word when
there's a strong connection

00:00:23.923 --> 00:00:26.714
between the two things that it's linking.

00:00:26.714 --> 00:00:28.091
So if I want to tell someone what I think

00:00:28.091 --> 00:00:31.395
about two movies about
animals, I could say:

00:00:31.395 --> 00:00:34.574
Both movies are great,
but Sky Pal has one thing

00:00:34.574 --> 00:00:37.939
that makes it better:
dogs that play sports.

00:00:37.939 --> 00:00:39.760
This is one sentence with two parts

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.557
that are linked with this colon.

00:00:41.557 --> 00:00:43.547
So the first part says,
both movies are great,

00:00:43.547 --> 00:00:45.847
but Sky Pal has one things
that makes it better.

00:00:45.847 --> 00:00:48.570
And that could stand alone as a sentence,

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.996
but it doesn't tell us
what that one thing is.

00:00:51.996 --> 00:00:53.910
So the colon comes in and tells us,

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.149
I'm about to tell you what that thing is,

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:57.922
dogs that play sports.

00:00:57.922 --> 00:00:59.989
So in this case the
colon just sort of serves

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:02.798
as a connection between the
purple part of the sentence

00:01:02.798 --> 00:01:04.794
and the yellow part of the sentence.

00:01:04.794 --> 00:01:06.339
Another example is something like:

00:01:06.339 --> 00:01:07.747
Going skydiving made me face

00:01:07.747 --> 00:01:10.830
one of my greatest fears: parachutes.

00:01:14.574 --> 00:01:16.867
Right, again this colon is
sort of linking these two

00:01:16.867 --> 00:01:19.319
parts of the sentence where one answers

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:21.545
an unanswered question
from the first part.

00:01:21.545 --> 00:01:23.990
Like, what is this greatest fear?

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:25.344
Well, it's parachutes.

00:01:25.344 --> 00:01:26.776
The colon is here to link between

00:01:26.776 --> 00:01:29.769
this whole independent clause
and the word parachutes.

00:01:29.769 --> 00:01:32.097
I could just as well say
going skydiving made me face

00:01:32.097 --> 00:01:34.409
one of my greatest fears.

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.243
That's a perfectly fine sentence.

00:01:36.243 --> 00:01:39.025
But without a colon linking
to what that fear is,

00:01:39.025 --> 00:01:41.377
that sentence just kind
of leaves us wondering.

00:01:41.377 --> 00:01:43.882
So another sort of subset
of the colon's ability

00:01:43.882 --> 00:01:46.939
to link things is that
it can introduce things.

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:50.390
One thing that the colon
can introduce is a list.

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:51.223
I could say:

00:01:51.223 --> 00:01:54.547
We needed to find three more
items on the scavenger hunt:

00:01:54.547 --> 00:01:58.714
a four-leaf clover, a cauldron,
and an abandoned ship.

00:02:00.807 --> 00:02:03.856
The second thing a colon
can introduce is an item.

00:02:03.856 --> 00:02:05.154
If I'm talking about the other day

00:02:05.154 --> 00:02:08.493
when I had a weird legume
craving, I could say:

00:02:08.493 --> 00:02:12.660
I only wanted one thing from
the grocery store: peanuts.

00:02:16.261 --> 00:02:19.387
Lastly, a colon can introduce a quote.

00:02:19.387 --> 00:02:22.173
My friend Liz says it best:

00:02:22.173 --> 00:02:25.079
"Never open a jar of
pickles you can't close."

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:26.928
I'm not really sure what that means,

00:02:26.928 --> 00:02:28.850
but she does say it best.

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.598
So, as you can see, like it
was in the first couple of

00:02:31.598 --> 00:02:34.931
example sentences, there's
kind of information missing

00:02:34.931 --> 00:02:37.596
from the first parts of all
three of these sentences.

00:02:37.596 --> 00:02:40.261
We needed to find three more
items on the scavenger hunt.

00:02:40.261 --> 00:02:42.332
Well, what did you need to find?

00:02:42.332 --> 00:02:45.330
Or, I only wanted one thing
from the grocery store.

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:46.576
What did you want?

00:02:46.576 --> 00:02:47.846
Or, my friend Liz says it best.

00:02:47.846 --> 00:02:49.568
Well, what does she say?

00:02:49.568 --> 00:02:51.142
That's were the colon comes in,

00:02:51.142 --> 00:02:53.922
to introduce that missing information.

00:02:53.922 --> 00:02:56.589
So there's one final case
of the linking function

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:58.997
of the colon that I want
to get into in this video.

00:02:58.997 --> 00:03:00.778
If you remember from the
beginning of the video,

00:03:00.778 --> 00:03:03.903
I said that colons can
introduce an independent clause

00:03:03.903 --> 00:03:06.511
to another independent clause sometimes.

00:03:06.511 --> 00:03:08.525
That's pretty rare.

00:03:08.525 --> 00:03:11.149
Usually that's the job of
a comma and a conjunction,

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:12.823
or maybe a semicolon.

00:03:12.823 --> 00:03:14.716
But, as always, it's still
important for you to know

00:03:14.716 --> 00:03:17.472
even the things that don't
happen all that often.

00:03:17.472 --> 00:03:20.146
Something like, remember
to take off your sunglasses

00:03:20.146 --> 00:03:22.036
when you drive through a tunnel:

00:03:22.036 --> 00:03:24.089
you can't see when it's that dark.

00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:26.600
The colon in this example
shows that, you can't see

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.228
when it's that dark is
an explanation of why

00:03:29.228 --> 00:03:31.180
you need to take off your sunglasses.

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:32.808
This is one of the two types of sentences

00:03:32.808 --> 00:03:34.611
where it makes sense to have a colon

00:03:34.611 --> 00:03:36.413
between two parts of the sentence

00:03:36.413 --> 00:03:40.113
that could stand on their
own as individual sentences.

00:03:40.113 --> 00:03:44.280
So we can say, one, the second
part explains the first part.

00:03:45.502 --> 00:03:47.104
The other case is when the second part

00:03:47.104 --> 00:03:49.474
of the sentence is emphasized.

00:03:49.474 --> 00:03:51.132
So this would be something like,

00:03:51.132 --> 00:03:55.657
I drank way too much soda: I'm
never going to fall asleep!

00:03:55.657 --> 00:03:57.435
These are two independent clauses

00:03:57.435 --> 00:03:59.619
that could be their own sentences,

00:03:59.619 --> 00:04:01.139
but they're closely related enough that

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:03.394
it makes sense to have
them connected as one.

00:04:03.394 --> 00:04:05.241
So the colon links them together.

00:04:05.241 --> 00:04:06.898
And the second part is emphasized, right?

00:04:06.898 --> 00:04:08.950
That's the focus of the sentence.

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:10.578
I'm never going to fall asleep!

00:04:10.578 --> 00:04:12.183
So in these two sentences we can see

00:04:12.183 --> 00:04:14.600
that the colon can connect two parts

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.206
that can stand alone as
their own sentences, right?

00:04:17.206 --> 00:04:18.833
Whether it's two independent clauses,

00:04:18.833 --> 00:04:21.782
like in the second sentence,
or an independent clause

00:04:21.782 --> 00:04:24.565
that's technically connected
to a dependent clause

00:04:24.565 --> 00:04:26.157
but can stand alone.

00:04:26.157 --> 00:04:28.832
Now okay, this usage is really uncommon.

00:04:28.832 --> 00:04:30.024
I really want to stress that.

00:04:30.024 --> 00:04:33.105
Usually when we're uniting
two independent clauses,

00:04:33.105 --> 00:04:34.822
or at least two parts of a sentence

00:04:34.822 --> 00:04:37.934
that can stand on their own
as individual sentences,

00:04:37.934 --> 00:04:42.030
we're gonna use a comma and
a conjunction or a semicolon.

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:43.465
But in the case that the second clause,

00:04:43.465 --> 00:04:46.085
or the second part of the
sentence is emphasized

00:04:46.085 --> 00:04:48.593
or explaining the first clause,

00:04:48.593 --> 00:04:50.472
then you'll want to use a colon.

00:04:50.472 --> 00:04:51.411
Just keep that in mind.

00:04:51.411 --> 00:04:54.729
Usually this independent to
independent clause linking

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:57.152
happens with a semicolon and not a colon.

00:04:57.152 --> 00:04:58.843
But regardless, this is important to know.

00:04:58.843 --> 00:05:00.662
It's possible in these specific cases.

00:05:00.662 --> 00:05:01.942
What's most important for you to take away

00:05:01.942 --> 00:05:04.100
is that the colon can link things

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.743
and introduce things as
part of its many functions.

00:05:07.743 --> 00:05:09.426
And that's the linking
function of the colon.

00:05:09.426 --> 00:05:11.950
We've got independent
clauses, dependent clauses,

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:14.078
phrases, words, and introductions

00:05:14.078 --> 00:05:16.905
for lists, and items, and quotes.

00:05:16.905 --> 00:05:17.891
You can learn anything.

00:05:17.891 --> 00:05:18.724
Paige out.
