00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.208
So, in this lesson, we've learned many different things about what personality

00:00:04.208 --> 00:00:08.745
is, what it's dimensions are, how we measure it. What are the causes of

00:00:08.745 --> 00:00:14.400
personality, and even whether animals have personality. So, for instance, we've

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.684
seen that personality is uniquely behaving in a similar way over time and in

00:00:18.684 --> 00:00:24.912
many different situations. So, the basic dimensions of personality are the so

00:00:24.912 --> 00:00:30.596
called big five or ocean dimensions. So, openness, conscientiousness,

00:00:30.596 --> 00:00:36.529
extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. We've also seen how personality

00:00:36.529 --> 00:00:41.815
is measured both qualitatively and quantitatively. Qualitatively, we measure

00:00:41.815 --> 00:00:46.625
personality through interviews and ink box. And quantitatively we measure it

00:00:46.625 --> 00:00:51.400
through self report and behavioral observations. We've also seen how

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.085
personality and the causes of personality can be studied through twin adoption

00:00:55.085 --> 00:01:02.193
studies. So, to see how genes and environment play a role in our personalities.

00:01:02.193 --> 00:01:06.341
And then finally, we have seen how animals, nonhuman animals, share some

00:01:06.341 --> 00:01:11.500
personality traits common with humans. So, for instance, extroversion and

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.460
neuroticism.
