00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.200
Do females really select the best penis to
mate with?

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.130
… Come on.

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:11.330
Hi Guys, Crystal here for DNews.

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:13.020
Ready to talk about penises?

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:17.250
Well Harvard scientists working with international
collaborators have discovered that the penis

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.660
of a Caribbean lizard may be evolving faster
than their other physiological traits.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.410
This is a result of sexual selection that
contributes to genetic as well as genital

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.369
diversity in the species and leads to questions
as to why this occurs:

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.539
Do females, who have the power of mate choice,
select the “best” penis for them?

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:38.570
Or, is this diversity the result of a sexual
arms race with male lizards looking to reduce

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.469
female control of reproduction?

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.430
Well, lets get into the dirty details.

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.829
Lizard penises are different from human ones.

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:49.600
For one thing, male lizards (and others in
the order Squamata) don’t just have one

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.989
penis, they have a pair of organs called hemipenes.

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.789
Don’t get too excited, they usually only
use one at a time, and hemipenes means “half

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:03.430
penis” so … Anyway, these organs are kept
inside the body for day to day activities,

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.880
and then one becomes externalized by erectile
tissue for reproductive purposes.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.810
The scientists who performed the study used
comparative methods to ask whether there was

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:17.090
more variability in hemipenis shape (length
and width), than of non-genital traits like

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.249
limbs and dewlaps - a flap of skin under a
lizzard’s throat.

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:25.310
This is an important question to answer because
increased diversity would imply an increased

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.619
evolutionary rate for genitalia.

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:33.310
To ask this question, scientists examined
hemipenes and body morphology from 5 samples

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:39.320
of 25 species of Anolis lizard in an attempt
to represent the “diversity of microhabitat

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.940
specialists in the Caribbean anoles”.

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.430
What they found, when they compared measurements
is that many very closely related lizards

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.500
have hemipenes very different from each other!

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.060
Scientists were able to calculate the rate
of change necessary to produce such different

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.810
genital features and put this information
in the context of a relative lack of diversity

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.490
in limbs and dewlaps to conclude that the
genitalia of caribbean Anoles lizards evolve

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.149
approximately six times faster than other
morphological traits.

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:12.160
Genitalia is frequently used to differentiate
similar species, but no one has done a quantitative

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.120
measure of increased evolutionary rate until
now.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.810
And the speed of evolution is so different
that it begs the question, why?

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.420
Well, the scientists who performed this study
assumed that the rapid evolution of male genitalia

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.630
was a result of co-evolution with the female
and proposed two hypotheses: either the evolution

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.580
occurred through “cryptic female choice”
where females drive selection through personal

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.810
preference, or “sexually antagonistic coevolution”
an attempt on the part of male lizards to

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.510
reduce the female influence on reproduction.

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.110
More studies are needed to determine which
of these is happening here, but what do you

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.110
think?

Inexplicable female choice or sexual arms
race?
