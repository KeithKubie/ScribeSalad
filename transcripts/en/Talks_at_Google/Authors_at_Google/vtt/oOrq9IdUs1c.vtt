[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.568 --> 00:00:07.420
RYAN WALSH: Hi,
thanks everybody.

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:09.430
I really appreciate
you having me

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:11.590
here, and taking your
time out of your day

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:13.930
to come listen to me.

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:19.031
I'm going to read some things,
and talk, and play some clips.

00:00:19.031 --> 00:00:20.530
We can do Q&amp;A at
the end, but if you

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:23.860
have any questions in the
middle, just spit them out.

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.630
Because conversation is
more interesting than

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.350
like a monologue to me.

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:33.790
OK, so basically the
short story of this

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:40.210
is I was like 22, very sad,
lonely, heartbroken dude,

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.530
as many people in their
young 20s find themselves,

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.520
and also buying way
too many records, CDs.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.300
And I just came upon
"Astral Weeks" in a store

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.450
in Newton, a Newbury
Comics in Newton.

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.934
And the title and
the front cover--

00:00:57.934 --> 00:01:00.100
I was like, I got to see
what kind of music that is.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.550
And I ended up--

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.280
long story short-- becoming
obsessed with the record.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.150
And I don't know how
familiar you all are with it,

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.500
but on the back there's
this poem that's

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.210
signed by Van Morrison.

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:18.460
And he's talking about like
Hyannis and Cambridge Port.

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.500
And just being a bad geography
student, I was like, well,

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.500
those must be places
in Ireland as well.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.080
And it took me a while to figure
out he was talking about here.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.760
And then when I did confirm
that, I was like, well,

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.090
why the hell was he here?

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.540
That makes no sense,
he's from Belfast.

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:43.270
And it turns out he had a
terrible record deal with Bang

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.850
Records out of New York City.

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.880
And they were
mobbed up, and there

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.130
was a guy put in charge of Van
that was basically a mobster.

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.650
And I visited him
at his apartment.

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.410
And that's where we'll
start, if I can find it.

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:02.050
"Now that Berns was dead,
Morrison's main contact

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.530
at Bang Records was Carmine
"Wassel" de Noia, whose father

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.900
was the inspiration for
the character Nicely-Nicely

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.460
in "Guys and Dolls."

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.430
Wassel was an even less
forgiving boss than Berns.

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.000
While the FBI classified him
as only a low level mobster,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.130
he was still a scary menace.

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.100
In 1975, Wassel was
convicted of payola,

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.700
bribing radio DJ's in exchange
for heavy rotation of a record,

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.380
which might not
sound like rough work

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.320
until you hear how Wassel
described a typical day.

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.410
"So here's this disk
jockey," Wassel said in 2001.

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.025
"I threw him up at the window,
pick him up, flip him, shake

00:02:35.025 --> 00:02:36.490
him by the ankles, ninth floor.

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.380
All the change fell
out of his pockets.

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.540
Some friends of
mine picked it up."

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.810
Even today, Wassel hasn't lost
any of his tough guy schtick.

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.050
When I ring him up one night, he
answers, "hello, city morgue."

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:48.430
He's lived for
more than 50 years

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.322
on West 72nd Street
in Manhattan.

00:02:51.322 --> 00:02:53.530
When I arrive, he's wearing
a loose white undershirt,

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.290
blue pajama pants, and
thick-rimmed black glasses.

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.540
He's friendly, forthcoming,
and a little scattered.

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.280
"I helped that guy out,"
Wassel insists about Morrison.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.200
"If he ever sees me again, he
better stand up and salute me."

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.800
It was weird, he didn't realize
anything he had done was bad.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.490
Like when he told me that
at a party for the release

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:15.280
of "Brown-Eyed Girl," he
threw Tiny Tim off a boat

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.660
into the Hudson River.

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.779
He was laughing, he was
like, "he was all wet."

00:03:18.779 --> 00:03:21.070
And then his nurse was there,
and she was laughing too.

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:25.210
I was like, has he badly
influenced this woman?

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:29.440
That seems like a terrible
thing to do to another person.

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.980
Wassel says he got Bert Berns
started in the music business.

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.410
Of course, Berns had been
involved in the music business

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:36.340
long before they met.

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.590
So what he actually meant
was that he introduced Berns

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.860
to full-blown gangsters like
the Genovese family member Patsy

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.460
Pagano, and to the quick
results that brute force yielded

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:47.950
when applied to the
creative industries.

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.830
Back in Berns's day,
this included everything

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.160
for bullying performers back
into studios, dismantling

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.827
local record bootlegging
operations with a sledgehammer,

00:03:57.827 --> 00:03:59.410
and finding a way
to borrow money that

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:01.390
didn't require a credit check.

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.672
These connections gave
Berns and Bang Records

00:04:03.672 --> 00:04:05.380
an advantage that
could level the playing

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.790
field against the more
established labels.

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:14.050
In August, 1967, Berns organized
a belated record release party

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:17.054
for "Brown-Eyed Girl" on a boat
that departed from 50th Street

00:04:17.054 --> 00:04:18.260
in Manhattan.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.452
Van attended with his
new love, Janet Rigsbee.

00:04:20.452 --> 00:04:21.910
There's a picture
from this evening

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:23.740
hanging on Wassel's wall.

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.830
The framed photo shows the
singer sporting a rare smile.

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.500
Janet looks happily taken
back by the fanfare.

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.150
Berns is glancing at Janet.

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.730
And Wassel is in back, a giant
cigar stuffed in his mouth,

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:37.240
with his eyes closed
and head tilted back.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.790
Performer Tin Tim tried to join
the festivities that night, I

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:41.920
learned, but Wassel says
he threw him overboard

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.300
into the Hudson River.

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.700
"They had to fish him out
of there," Wassel tells me.

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.110
"He was soaked."

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.150
At some point in the
evening, Morrison

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.850
delivered a soulful
set for the revelers.

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:53.680
I asked Wassel to tell
me more about what

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.470
happened with Van Morrison
right before the singer fled

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:57.490
New York.

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.350
For a moment, he looked stumped.

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:03.160
"Oh," Wassel remembers, "I
broke his guitar on his head."

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.280
This is true, here's
what happened.

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.270
One night, Wassel visited the
singer at the King Edward Hotel

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.100
where Morrison and
Janet were staying.

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:13.200
They were already anxious.

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.440
Morrison's immigration peppers
were not wholly in order,

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.810
and he was worried
about being deported.

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:20.340
His last visit to
an office trying

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.830
to correct the work
permit issue ended

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:26.190
with an official telling him,
you're now deported, bye-bye.

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:27.660
During the encounter
with Wassel,

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.270
Morrison was
severely intoxicated.

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:33.420
Wassel asked about a radio
he'd given Morrison which

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:35.220
now appeared to be broken.

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:37.560
Morrison's temper flared
up, worsened by booze,

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.840
so Wassel put an end
to his incomprehensible

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.270
string of expletives by
smashing the singer's

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:44.269
acoustic over his head.

00:05:44.269 --> 00:05:46.560
Morrison would later tell
others that he and Janet once

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.410
returned from dinner to find
their hotel door full of bullet

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:50.310
holes.

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:53.790
Neil Diamond, Berns's
other poised-to-make-it act

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:57.000
at the time, reported
similar calamities.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.400
The unholy hell that was
unleashed upon Van when

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.650
Bert died was really
horrible, Janet

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:03.840
recalls, noting
another instance where

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:05.970
Wassel banged on
the door, screaming,

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:08.940
"you're finished in the music
business, do you hear me?"

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:10.440
All of this may
have had something

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:15.570
to do with why, in early 1968,
Van Morrison and Janet Rigsbee

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:20.440
hastily got married and moved
to Cambridge, Massachusetts."

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:23.940
So that kind of sets up the
whole story of the book here

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:25.340
is--

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:27.900
in all the Van
Morrison biographies,

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:31.200
his time in Cambridge is like
a page, half page, two pages.

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:35.610
And what I've found when I found
people who were in his band

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:37.770
or who saw him,
there were plenty

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:41.220
of stories, and all this
important structural groundwork

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:44.670
for "Astral Weeks"
being laid here.

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:47.670
His Boston band was called
the Van Morrison Controversy

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:48.390
for some reason.

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:51.350
It's the only time he's
tacked on a band name.

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:53.740
And there were three
distinct lineups of that.

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:55.890
And if the musicians
were alive and someone

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:58.260
remembered their name, I
was able to talk to them.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:01.935
And it's just kind of like
a real comedy of errors.

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:07.590
We think of him as a
legendary singer now,

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:12.194
but he was kind of
eating dirt all summer.

00:07:12.194 --> 00:07:14.610
Like outside of one show, after
they performed "Brown-Eyed

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:16.630
Girl," somebody walked
up to him and said,

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:18.380
did you write that
song "Brown-Eyed Girl?"

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:19.440
And he said, yeah.

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:21.060
And then he said,
the Rolling Stones

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:22.510
have really gone downhill.

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:23.010
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:26.330
And Van asks John Sheldon, his
guitarist, what that meant.

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:28.080
And he was like, ah,
just forget about it.

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:30.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:36.660
But when it came time to
turn this story into a book,

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:39.210
me and Ed Park, my
editor at Penguin,

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:41.910
decided that it would be
more interesting to kind

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:44.830
of use Boston and the
year of '68 as an anchor

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:48.180
and tell these other stories
as a way of fleshing out

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:50.610
the context of where
the album came from.

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:54.060
And what we found
was oftentimes,

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:56.460
when I would find
another exciting story,

00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:59.290
they would have a Van
Morrison anecdote.

00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:04.020
So next thing I'll do is
read from a chapter called

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:07.710
"The Silver Age of Television."

00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:11.340
And it's about this
really bizarre show

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:14.700
that was on WGBH for two
years for some reason.

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:17.820
So this is from far after
I found David Silver,

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:21.600
and before any of
this was online,

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:24.090
you could only kind of
go to GBH's archives

00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:27.630
or meet with David Silver
to watch these episodes.

00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:31.020
"Only about 20 minutes of
scattered clips exist online.

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:34.860
David Silver has agreed to show
me a full of the few episodes.

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:36.690
God knows what this
is, he says, softly

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:39.720
squinting as he scrolls through
a video player on a laptop.

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:41.309
This was just craziness.

00:08:41.309 --> 00:08:43.409
The show is about to begin.

00:08:43.409 --> 00:08:45.600
It goes like this--
a swarm of inkblots

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:48.570
cut to a circular logo
bouncing across the screen.

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:51.830
A child announces the title of
the show, then looks confused.

00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:54.860
A Jim Kweskin song plays
as the inkblots return.

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:56.940
A half-second clip
of a woman in a red

00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:59.260
dress staring off
into the distance.

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:02.620
Edits happen without warning and
truncate sentences throughout.

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:04.290
Host David Silver
sits on the floor

00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:07.440
and asks the woman a question,
but her answer goes unheard.

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:09.090
Cut to stock footage
of a man talking

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:11.190
about producing high
school yearbooks.

00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:12.750
Cut back to the
woman telling Silver

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:14.980
about an impending
cataclysmic event.

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:16.830
Micro cuts to old commercials.

00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:19.170
Aretha Franklin's
"Respect" starts to play.

00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:21.690
Behind Silver and the
lady in the red dress,

00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:23.840
a dozen young
people dance wildly.

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:25.920
Seated to their left and
right are extremely old

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:27.840
man and woman watching.

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:30.300
Backward sequence of
Silver eating a banana.

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:32.370
Stock footage run through
an effects module,

00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:35.610
rendering it in a new array
of psychedelic color patterns.

00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:38.490
Black and white footage
of samurais fighting.

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:40.110
The editing pace quickens.

00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:42.510
Four distinct audio
tracks play at once, often

00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:43.710
at odds with another.

00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:46.050
Silver, in all black,
fences with a woman

00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:47.430
dressed all in white.

00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:49.260
Inkblots overlay the duel.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.830
A woozy pattern spins as we
hear news reports of the Vietnam

00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:53.610
War.

00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:55.620
"You can be frozen for
several hundred years,"

00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:57.540
a woman in a
floral-patterned dress

00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:00.510
tell Silver, while the dancers
clap in time behind them.

00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:03.370
"That would break up the
monotony of eternity."

00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:05.560
The elderly pair looks confused.

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:08.140
Dave Wilson, an "Avatar"
newspaper founder,

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:10.300
drives his motorcycle
onto the set,

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:13.720
and does loops around the whole
scene, the exhaust thickening.

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:16.150
"Mustang Sally" by
Wilson Pickett plays.

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:18.460
Silver lies down with
the woman on the floor.

00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:20.230
The dancers keep
swaying, and Wilson

00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:22.780
continues to circle
everything with his hog.

00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:25.540
With no fanfare, the
end credits appear.

00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:26.620
The sound fades out.

00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:29.050
You're left in total silence,
watching the elderly pair's

00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:30.250
reactions.

00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:33.250
They do not understand
what just happened, do you?

00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:36.370
The episode, titled
"Madness and Intuition"

00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:41.540
won a National Education
Television Award."

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:46.100
So as entertaining as I
find "Antiques Roadshow,"

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:49.990
this sounds a little stranger
of what public television can

00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:50.930
allow on the air.

00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:53.720
So basically, this
story is about how

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:56.330
David Silver and the show
became very famous in Boston

00:10:56.330 --> 00:11:00.170
and Cambridge very briefly, and
then got in a lot of trouble.

00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:02.420
So they aired this--

00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:06.480
Howard Zinn of course,
quite famous author,

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:09.510
but was just a BU
professor at the time.

00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:14.390
And so he just goes on this like
three minute anti-Vietnam war

00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:19.340
rant, which was like the
second punch for the show.

00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:21.932
After this clip, "thank you,
Professor Zinn," Silveer says.

00:11:21.932 --> 00:11:23.390
"I agree with every
word you said."

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:30.370
But the mood inside
WGBH was grim.

00:11:30.370 --> 00:11:32.280
The program director,
Michael Rice,

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:35.370
told director Fred Barzyk
that what they'd done

00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:36.600
was unacceptable.

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:38.140
"We're embarrassed," he said.

00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:39.960
"This may be the
end of the show."

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:42.360
Barzyk feigned mild concern.

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:44.430
The two colleagues had a
love-hate relationship,

00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:47.310
and Barzyk knew how to
push Rice's buttons.

00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:49.170
Now he wondered how to respond.

00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:51.810
"This is an experimental
show, and you can't win

00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:54.330
if you don't lose," he cajoled.

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:57.330
"You have to have disaster so
you can do something better."

00:11:57.330 --> 00:11:58.410
Rice called his bluff.

00:11:58.410 --> 00:12:00.450
He proposed having their
sit down conversation

00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:02.580
about the appropriateness
of that show's

00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:05.130
content on the air as
a live new episode,

00:12:05.130 --> 00:12:07.440
maybe the finale of the series.

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:10.620
"Let's do that," Barzyk
said, his eyes lighting up."

00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:13.650
So what they did was
put the show on trial,

00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:16.290
and it's an episode of the show.

00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:19.994
So basically, they do
this elaborate dance,

00:12:19.994 --> 00:12:21.660
purposely misunderstanding
his question,

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:23.820
till they're finally
like, why did you

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:28.307
talk about Nancy Sinatra's fake
breasts on public television?

00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:34.490
"Silver suggests the idea
of ending future shows

00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:37.040
with a note about his opinions
not reflecting the station's

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:40.160
beliefs, to which Rice
replies, "the issue is

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:44.000
whether we want anything to do
with you in the first place."

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.990
The issue of Howard Zinn's
brutal anti-Vietnam editorial

00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:49.744
is an afterthought, addressed
near the end of the debate.

00:12:49.744 --> 00:12:52.160
Smith believes it should have
been followed by an opposing

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:55.910
opinion, while Rice calls
it an eloquent presentation

00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:57.410
of a point of view.

00:12:57.410 --> 00:12:59.450
Then Rice sums up, "whether
he likes it or not,

00:12:59.450 --> 00:13:01.850
David Silver is now
a public persona.

00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:05.480
Silver," he contends,
"has commandeered

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:07.910
WGBH for trivial purposes."

00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:10.290
"I think that's a melodramatic
way of looking at it,"

00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:11.261
Silver protests.

00:13:11.261 --> 00:13:13.760
"I think it's significant that
we should end this discussion

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:16.130
on what is basically a
point of disagreement,"

00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:17.090
Spergel concludes.

00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:19.100
"Thank you for being with us."

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:22.070
I asked Barzyk if having
his professional credentials

00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:26.510
questioned by his supervisor on
television was awkward for him.

00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:29.720
"No, to me it was the height
of the entire series," he says.

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:32.800
"All drama is conflict,
the episode was theater."

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:36.620
In fact, Fred told me
that anytime Rice spoke,

00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:38.420
he was in cahoots
with the cameraman

00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:41.480
to close up on his
face or Silver's face,

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:44.090
and they would just
project the look

00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:48.080
of someone being censored
as another kind of way

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:50.300
to cheat the trial here.

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:52.910
So letters in support
of the show flooded

00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:58.070
in after this episode, and the
show got to remain on the air.

00:13:58.070 --> 00:14:01.300
But not for long, which is
the rest of that chapter.

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:06.770
So one afternoon, Morrison just
showed up at Silver's house.

00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:08.450
And Silver was one
of the few people

00:14:08.450 --> 00:14:13.210
who knew his old band,
Them, in Boston at the time.

00:14:13.210 --> 00:14:17.060
And the same manager was kind
of courting both of them,

00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:18.800
and they just had
this afternoon.

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:22.520
Any story I found interesting
that was Boston in '68,

00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:24.440
I earmarked to be in the book.

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:27.040
But if it also intersected
with Van Morrison,

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:29.540
the it kind of shot straight
to the top of the list.

00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:31.436
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:14:31.436 --> 00:14:34.020
RYAN WALSH: He's from
England, Manchester.

00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:37.040
So he came over as a
visiting Tufts professor.

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:38.710
And there's multiple stories.

00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:42.650
He remembers someone
suggesting that he

00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:44.510
should try out for a TV show.

00:14:44.510 --> 00:14:47.240
And his girlfriend
remembers that they

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:50.111
walked in off the street, and
said, he deserves a TV show.

00:14:50.111 --> 00:14:50.610
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:54.402
So I don't know
which one is true.

00:14:54.402 --> 00:14:57.853
AUDIENCE: Do you know if he had
a TV show there in Manchester?

00:14:57.853 --> 00:14:59.050
RYAN WALSH: He didn't, no.

00:14:59.050 --> 00:15:00.410
He was he was pretty young.

00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:04.490
He had just-- he was a
hardcore Shakespeare scholar

00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:06.310
back in Manchester.

00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:08.480
So I mean, after
this show, he went on

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:11.415
to direct a documentary
about the Beatles, one

00:15:11.415 --> 00:15:13.290
of the first documentaries
about the Beatles.

00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:15.712
And he's been in
the record industry.

00:15:15.712 --> 00:15:17.420
When I found him to
talk to him for this,

00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:20.150
he was co-hosting a
mindfulness podcast.

00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:25.430
And he was a great guy.

00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:28.760
Both Fred and Silver, I
just loved talking to them,

00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:31.520
and learning about
this crazy show.

00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:36.600
I wish GBH would take a weird
chance like that today and air

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:38.910
something like this.

00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:42.540
The next thing I'm going to
read and show you clips from

00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:48.090
are about a problem we all
know, which is the hippie.

00:15:48.090 --> 00:15:50.490
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:50.490 --> 00:15:55.240
This is a chapter about an
underground newspaper called

00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:58.330
"Avatar" in '67-'68 in Boston.

00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:02.170
And it was kind of
a scandalous paper.

00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:07.900
It published a lot of filthy
poems and words and pictures.

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:12.046
And this is about the censorship
efforts of Cambridge and Boston

00:16:12.046 --> 00:16:13.420
officials to shut
the paper down.

00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:17.200
"It started in Cambridge.

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:19.990
Throughout the first
10 months of 1967,

00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:23.590
Mayor Daniel J. Hayes Jr.
had grown increasingly fed

00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:25.150
up with a scourge
that was spreading

00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:27.070
along the banks of
the Charles River,

00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:29.860
and alarmingly, into the main
streets of his great city.

00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:30.820
The problem?

00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:31.840
Hippies.

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:35.080
"The great unwashed are creating
an intolerable situation

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:37.690
in our city by the
widespread use of drugs

00:16:37.690 --> 00:16:40.960
and other anti-social practices,
such as boys and girls living

00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:42.960
together under the
guise of free love

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:46.750
and without any benefit of
clergy," Hayes declared.

00:16:46.750 --> 00:16:49.330
Two days after his announcement
of a war on hippies,

00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:50.890
there was a
televised police raid

00:16:50.890 --> 00:16:54.910
of 183 Columbia Street, a
house in a slum of Cambridge,

00:16:54.910 --> 00:16:58.120
yielding narcotics arrests
for the 17 people inside.

00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:00.339
"I never saw such
a filthy situation.

00:17:00.339 --> 00:17:01.880
There are terms in
which I could use,

00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:03.588
but I would not use
in public," the mayor

00:17:03.588 --> 00:17:06.940
told reporters, proud
of his self-censorship.

00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:09.400
Hayes was up for re-election
in less than a month,

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:12.280
and the purge was a way
of grabbing headlines.

00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:14.680
One bizarre profile in
the "Harvard Crimson"

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:17.829
featured Hayes gleefully
sipping a chocolate shake,

00:17:17.829 --> 00:17:20.950
smoking Newports, and
expounding on his hot new term

00:17:20.950 --> 00:17:22.240
for hippies.

00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:25.930
"It's not the hippie,
it's the hipbo."

00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:26.910
Come again?

00:17:26.910 --> 00:17:30.550
Hipbo comes from three
things, first hobo, second,

00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:34.930
the combination of hippie and
bum, third from Lifebuoy soap.

00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:37.500
Remember that commercial
with the fog horn blowing?

00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:39.670
BO, BO.

00:17:39.670 --> 00:17:41.460
That term did not catch on.

00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:42.220
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:47.080
Hayes had no idea that Lyman,
the mastermind behind "Avatar"

00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:50.140
hated the very concept of
the hippie just as he did.

00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:53.110
But it wouldn't have mattered,
he knew filth when he saw it.

00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:55.900
At first Hayes figured he could
shut the underground rag down

00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:57.231
on a technicality.

00:17:57.231 --> 00:17:59.230
The editors were warned
that their offices would

00:17:59.230 --> 00:18:01.030
be condemned unless
they installed

00:18:01.030 --> 00:18:02.950
a separate bathroom
for men and women,

00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:04.636
"Boston Magazine" reported.

00:18:04.636 --> 00:18:06.010
Rather than bow
to what they felt

00:18:06.010 --> 00:18:09.490
was patent harassment, the paper
moved itself to 37 Rutledge

00:18:09.490 --> 00:18:12.160
Street in Boston's South End.

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:14.950
The next issue of "Avatar"
featured a mock obituary

00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:16.270
of Mayor Hayes.

00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:19.150
At the mayor's behest, an
anonymous city council member

00:18:19.150 --> 00:18:21.490
spread word to three of
Cambridge's biggest newspaper

00:18:21.490 --> 00:18:24.100
stands that continued
sales of "Avatar"

00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:26.230
would result in prosecution.

00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:27.880
All capitulated.

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:30.670
Mel Lyman retaliated by
sending hordes of Hill people

00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:33.730
into Harvard Square
to hawk the newspaper

00:18:33.730 --> 00:18:34.960
the old-fashioned way."

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:39.410
So kind of the team
behind "Avatar"

00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:43.270
were this communal
group up on Fort Hill

00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:46.930
in Roxbury, led by this
harmonica banjo player named

00:18:46.930 --> 00:18:49.836
Mel Lyman, who right around
the time the paper started,

00:18:49.836 --> 00:18:52.480
started telling
everyone he was God.

00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:56.440
And then things get
really weird up there.

00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:58.540
And then half the
"Avatar" newspaper

00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:03.340
is like you know just kind of
like an altar laid out for Mel.

00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:05.710
So the "Boston Globe"
and local TV news

00:19:05.710 --> 00:19:09.600
were obsessed with Mel and
the Fort Hill community,

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:12.280
and like just what
was happening up there

00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:13.420
and how they were living.

00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:15.730
At one point, the Lyman
family owned every house

00:19:15.730 --> 00:19:18.760
on Ford Ave Terrace, and
even a couple on Ford Avenue,

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:21.910
forming an L-shaped territory
hugging the southwest corner

00:19:21.910 --> 00:19:23.850
of Highland Park in Roxbury.

00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:26.890
Though the constituent
standpipe belonged to the City

00:19:26.890 --> 00:19:28.852
of Boston--" there's this--

00:19:28.852 --> 00:19:30.310
you might have seen
it around town,

00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:33.880
the giant tower you can see
from a lot of locales in Boston

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:36.100
up there in Roxbury.

00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:38.650
"It belonged to the city, but
the Lymans cut the lock off it,

00:19:38.650 --> 00:19:40.540
replaced it with
their own, and began

00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:42.910
to fix up the
spooky-looking relic as well

00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:44.920
as the weedy broken
glass-covered park that

00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:46.070
surrounded it.

00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:47.795
Throughout '67
and '68, Mel Lyman

00:19:47.795 --> 00:19:49.420
in the Fort Hill
community were treated

00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:53.500
as a curiosity in the press,
with reporters and TV producers

00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:56.650
trudging up the hill to capture
a human interest piece in step

00:19:56.650 --> 00:19:57.940
with the times.

00:19:57.940 --> 00:19:59.620
But after Charles
Manson and his family

00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:03.400
went on their killing spree
in Los Angeles in 1969,

00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:05.470
the public regarded the
idea of communal living

00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:07.690
under the direction of
a charismatic leader

00:20:07.690 --> 00:20:10.660
with greater alarm.

00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:13.120
David Felton, the editor of
Hunter S. Thompson's "Fear

00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:16.570
and Loathing in Las Vegas,"
had covered the Manson story

00:20:16.570 --> 00:20:18.550
for "Rolling Stone,"
and in '71, he

00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:21.820
went to Boston to investigate
the Lymans for the magazine.

00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:24.130
His story spanned two
back to back issues,

00:20:24.130 --> 00:20:26.380
and landed Mel on the cover.

00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:28.330
The article identifies
many family members

00:20:28.330 --> 00:20:31.900
by full name, investigates
Lyman's media company, titled

00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:34.240
United Illuminating
Incorporated,

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:37.216
and interviews
devotees and defectors.

00:20:37.216 --> 00:20:38.590
It's filled with
larger than life

00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:41.680
details and startling quotes,
such as this one from folk

00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:44.950
musician, Jim Kweskin, the
man who five years earlier was

00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:48.100
famous for making music
with kazoos and washboards.

00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:50.230
"The Manson family
preached peace and love

00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:51.880
and went around killing people.

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:53.650
We don't preach peace
and love, and we

00:20:53.650 --> 00:20:54.790
haven't killed anyone yet."

00:20:54.790 --> 00:20:56.110
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:59.950
In the spring of 1968, Lyman
had a dream whose imagery

00:20:59.950 --> 00:21:01.397
he felt was prescriptive.

00:21:01.397 --> 00:21:02.980
The next day, he
ordered his followers

00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:05.440
to construct a formidable
protective wall

00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:06.790
around his house.

00:21:06.790 --> 00:21:09.240
Like Van Morrison across
the Charles River,

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:11.200
Lyman was now commanding
people based on what

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:13.030
he saw when he was sleeping.

00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:15.580
Now, driving down
Ford Ave Terrace,

00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:17.940
the wall was the only
thing I could focus on.

00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:20.110
As I got close to the door
they built into the wall,

00:21:20.110 --> 00:21:23.350
I noticed a green mailbox
affixed to the structure.

00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:25.120
On a piece of paper
taped to the mailbox

00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:28.240
was a list of current
residents, Jim Kweskin,

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:30.940
United Illuminating, and
half a dozen other names

00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:32.890
associated with
the Lyman family.

00:21:32.890 --> 00:21:35.410
I looked up in shock at
the house behind the wall,

00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:37.030
and saw the silhouettes
of some people

00:21:37.030 --> 00:21:38.860
through the main bay window.

00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:42.560
Mel Lyman has been gone since
1978, but in that moment,

00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:44.860
I realized that his
family was alive and well,

00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:47.920
and were still living
up on Fort Hill."

00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:52.690
So that kind of launched me
into the book's other main story

00:21:52.690 --> 00:21:56.920
thread, which is that community,
and what happened to Mel Lyman,

00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:59.400
because they
wouldn't tell anybody

00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:02.140
where or how he died in '78.

00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:04.717
And basically,
they haven't talked

00:22:04.717 --> 00:22:05.800
to journalists in decades.

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:10.720
But as I started just
e-mailing, poking around,

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:11.960
they reached out to me.

00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:13.840
And then suddenly, they
were talking to me,

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:17.702
and I even took a
tour of the houses.

00:22:17.702 --> 00:22:23.570
And yeah, so their story--

00:22:23.570 --> 00:22:26.100
like Ian said there,
they started out

00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:28.730
as kind of a community
based on let's create

00:22:28.730 --> 00:22:32.060
a lot of beautiful music,
and where they ended up

00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:34.847
was really far afield from that.

00:22:34.847 --> 00:22:36.430
I'm going to just
read one more thing,

00:22:36.430 --> 00:22:39.500
and then hopefully, we can
chat, and do some questions.

00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:43.790
And thanks again for coming
and listening to this.

00:22:43.790 --> 00:22:46.550
There's a later chapter in
the book about a James Brown

00:22:46.550 --> 00:22:50.660
concert in the wake of MLK's
assassination, which is

00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:53.540
a really famous story, concert.

00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:55.700
Basically, the city
of Boston realized

00:22:55.700 --> 00:22:58.220
they were damned
if they do, damned

00:22:58.220 --> 00:23:01.250
if they don't in regards
to putting the concert on.

00:23:01.250 --> 00:23:05.720
Because any major
city in America

00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:08.330
right after that
assassination was on the cusp

00:23:08.330 --> 00:23:10.200
of riots and unrest.

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:16.967
So what ended up happening
was that Mayor Kevin White had

00:23:16.967 --> 00:23:18.800
to figure out what to
do about this concert.

00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:21.800
And this section is a
short little history

00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:24.320
about the history--

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:28.020
rock and roll has had a very
troubled past in Boston.

00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:31.160
And this is the history
of it's banning,

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:33.560
and all the twists and turns.

00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:36.410
"It started in the
spring of 1956.

00:23:36.410 --> 00:23:38.510
At a rock and roll
dance at MIT, a student

00:23:38.510 --> 00:23:40.460
was badly injured,
leading police

00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:43.430
to shut down a similar event
the next week in Roxbury.

00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:47.270
When Chuck Berry and Jerry Lee
Lewis hit Boston in May, 1958,

00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:49.610
chaos erupted in the
streets after the show,

00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:52.370
when a group of 25 boys
in identical satin jackets

00:23:52.370 --> 00:23:53.510
got rowdy.

00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:55.610
Papers claim that the
law-abiding youth suddenly

00:23:55.610 --> 00:24:00.590
became bedeviled into
gangsterism and ran berserk.

00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:03.620
A sailor was stabbed, dozens
of others were beaten.

00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:09.620
The district attorney prosecuted
show promoter Alan Freed

00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:13.160
under anti-anarchy
laws, declaring

00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:16.580
he had unleashed a form of rock
and roll paganism in Boston.

00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:19.400
Freed was eventually
released, but Mayor John Hynes

00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:21.950
had seen enough, grumbling,
"these so-called musical

00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:24.500
programs are a disgrace
and must be stopped.

00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:27.860
As far as I'm concerned, Boston
has seen the last of them."

00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:31.760
After Hynes left office in 1960,
the total ban on rock shows

00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:36.320
was lifted, save for some at
the Boston Arena and the Boston

00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:37.220
Garden.

00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:40.400
City censor, Richard J.
Sinnot--" which is, by the way,

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:44.060
the greatest name
for a sensor, Sinnot.

00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:47.360
And Boston still had a city
censor to the late '70s, which

00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:49.700
was kind of unbelievable to me.

00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:52.712
"But Sinnot was in
charge of figuring out

00:24:52.712 --> 00:24:54.170
if an act was rock
and roll, or not

00:24:54.170 --> 00:24:57.915
and they could be booked
at a place like that.

00:24:57.915 --> 00:24:59.540
The Beatles were
allowed at the Garden,

00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:02.660
for instance, because they
are not really rock and roll.

00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:05.930
As for the Beach Boys,
Sinnot [? vacillated. ?]

00:25:05.930 --> 00:25:09.470
"Some people have claimed
they're folksingers," he said.

00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:13.430
Whoever decided that James Brown
was not rock and roll in 1968

00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:15.080
had been woefully misinformed."

00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:18.050
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:18.050 --> 00:25:20.390
And you can watch the
entire James Brown concert

00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:22.870
on YouTube, which I
can't recommend enough.

00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:25.850
It's not only
historically fascinating,

00:25:25.850 --> 00:25:30.530
but it's just one of the most
electric live performances.

00:25:30.530 --> 00:25:36.650
So as you can see, Van Morrison
and Mel Lyman kind of snake

00:25:36.650 --> 00:25:38.580
through the book.

00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:43.550
But I tried to cover a lot of
ground, do a lot of history,

00:25:43.550 --> 00:25:44.820
tell some fun stories.

00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:49.536
And I hope you enjoy it
when and if you read it.

00:25:49.536 --> 00:25:51.920
So thank you.

00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:54.360
If anyone has any
questions or comments?

00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:56.754
Yeah?

00:25:56.754 --> 00:25:58.920
AUDIENCE: You've never
written a book before, right?

00:25:58.920 --> 00:25:59.370
RYAN WALSH: That's right.

00:25:59.370 --> 00:26:00.370
AUDIENCE: What's
the longest thing

00:26:00.370 --> 00:26:02.157
you've ever written
before, and tell us

00:26:02.157 --> 00:26:04.205
about making this transition
to being an author?

00:26:04.205 --> 00:26:05.580
RYAN WALSH: OK.

00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:10.210
Well, I went to BU for film.

00:26:10.210 --> 00:26:12.490
And one of my majors
was screenwriting.

00:26:12.490 --> 00:26:15.610
So probably the longest piece
I've written before this book

00:26:15.610 --> 00:26:19.420
was some really terrible
screenplays in '01.

00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:23.290
I think two full lengths, which
mercifully have gone missing.

00:26:23.290 --> 00:26:24.820
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:26.770
And then for about
10 years after that,

00:26:26.770 --> 00:26:27.910
it was nothing but songs.

00:26:27.910 --> 00:26:32.110
I was just writing songs like
crazy, and I still do that.

00:26:32.110 --> 00:26:34.451
And then it wasn't
until 2012 that I

00:26:34.451 --> 00:26:36.325
started to do longer
pieces in "The Phoenix."

00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:45.820
Yeah, but definitely the first
book, and I'd like to do more.

00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:47.202
We'll see.

00:26:47.202 --> 00:26:49.998
AUDIENCE: What was the
most compelling interesting

00:26:49.998 --> 00:26:51.862
that you spoke with live?

00:26:51.862 --> 00:26:54.880
RYAN WALSH: I mean, I talked
to a lot of interesting people.

00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:58.320
I mean, one of the
biggest personalities--

00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:01.740
in '68, it kind of
lays the foundation

00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:05.190
for counterculture in
Boston that lasted just

00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:06.150
until a few years ago.

00:27:06.150 --> 00:27:10.050
Like this guy named Ray
Riepen, a Kansas lawyer,

00:27:10.050 --> 00:27:13.970
he started BCN, the famous
rock station that just closed,

00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:16.680
what, five years ago now?

00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:18.900
He bankrolled the
"Cambridge Phoenix," which

00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:20.202
became the "Boston Phoenix."

00:27:20.202 --> 00:27:21.660
And he opened the
Boston Tea Party,

00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:25.800
which was Boston's first
dedicated rock and roll venue.

00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:29.010
And he was a smart guy
and a good businessman,

00:27:29.010 --> 00:27:32.610
but he was not destined
to become like--

00:27:32.610 --> 00:27:35.400
they called him the hippie
entrepreneur in "Boston Globe."

00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:37.710
And he came into it by accident.

00:27:37.710 --> 00:27:42.270
So like he doesn't have an
appreciation for the art,

00:27:42.270 --> 00:27:43.830
but he's proud of what he did.

00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:46.657
So like for instance,
I'm like Ray,

00:27:46.657 --> 00:27:48.990
so the Velvet Underground
just stopped playing New York,

00:27:48.990 --> 00:27:50.970
and they pretty much just
played the Boston Tea

00:27:50.970 --> 00:27:53.490
Party for those few years.

00:27:53.490 --> 00:27:55.350
I was like, did you
like that music?

00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:59.520
And he was like, well, basically
they were a fucking joke.

00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:00.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:01.650
They had a girl drummer.

00:28:01.650 --> 00:28:02.820
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:05.400
And every junkie in
the New England area

00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:09.690
would come out and see them play
"Heroin," which they obliged.

00:28:09.690 --> 00:28:12.892
And just someone like-- even
at this point, when the Velvet

00:28:12.892 --> 00:28:14.850
Underground are like
considered one of the best

00:28:14.850 --> 00:28:19.260
bands of all time, Ray
is still trashing them,

00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:22.430
even though they were one of
the biggest draws at his club.

00:28:22.430 --> 00:28:27.464
And he was oftentimes,
mean to me.

00:28:27.464 --> 00:28:29.130
Sometimes I'd ask a
clarifying question,

00:28:29.130 --> 00:28:30.713
not because I didn't
understand, but I

00:28:30.713 --> 00:28:32.960
wanted him to say it a
different way or something.

00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:35.400
And he'd be like, I
just fucking told you.

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:37.650
How dumb do-- just really--

00:28:37.650 --> 00:28:39.120
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:43.470
There were some people who
were hostile, basically.

00:28:43.470 --> 00:28:47.440
But I knew I could do
anything for a year,

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:52.560
so I was like, I'll take any
bruises that putting this story

00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:56.234
together comes with, you know?

00:28:56.234 --> 00:28:57.376
AUDIENCE: Yeah?

00:28:57.376 --> 00:29:00.530
AUDIENCE: So I'm curious,
I know you interviewed

00:29:00.530 --> 00:29:02.960
a writer, Eric Kraft?

00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:03.635
RYAN WALSH: Yes.

00:29:03.635 --> 00:29:07.110
AUDIENCE: Eric's got a book
called "When Do You Stop?"

00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:09.270
I think it's "Where
Do You Stop?"

00:29:09.270 --> 00:29:13.835
but I was just wondering if
you found it sort of difficult

00:29:13.835 --> 00:29:15.580
as you were following
all these threads,

00:29:15.580 --> 00:29:18.400
you mentioned that sort of
having a connection back

00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:22.270
to Lyman or Morrison was sort
of one of your thresholds.

00:29:22.270 --> 00:29:28.822
But if there were
moments when you

00:29:28.822 --> 00:29:33.191
had to make tough calls about
whether a tangent kind of fit

00:29:33.191 --> 00:29:34.982
in the fabric book or
not, and if maybe you

00:29:34.982 --> 00:29:39.627
had any favorite bits that
didn't quite make it in?

00:29:39.627 --> 00:29:41.210
RYAN WALSH: I had a
lot favorite bits.

00:29:41.210 --> 00:29:44.000
I kind of went crazy and
turned in double the book.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.300
And you really have to give
a tremendous amount of credit

00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:48.380
to my editor, Ed Park.

00:29:48.380 --> 00:29:52.070
Because not only
would it not exist

00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:54.860
if it wasn't for him kind
of pushing me forward

00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:59.180
with this idea, but he also
knew what was interesting.

00:29:59.180 --> 00:30:02.540
I was like, no, this has to be
a Noah's Ark of information,

00:30:02.540 --> 00:30:04.400
and I need to put
all of this in.

00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:07.200
And he's like no, we'll just
put the good parts in, Ryan.

00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:07.700
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:14.190
And at the end stage of editing,
it would be cut paragraph,

00:30:14.190 --> 00:30:17.150
and then there used to
be a thoughtful note why.

00:30:17.150 --> 00:30:21.800
And like in the 12th hour,
he would just be like, no,

00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:25.520
or this sucks, or who cares?

00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:26.820
was my favorite one.

00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:28.070
But he was totally right.

00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:31.860
I mean, there were interesting
tidbits that got cut,

00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:35.340
but the heart of all
the stories remain,

00:30:35.340 --> 00:30:39.089
and that's why I'm
so grateful to Ed.

00:30:39.089 --> 00:30:40.055
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:40.055 --> 00:30:44.354
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I wanted you
to expand on a previous answer.

00:30:44.354 --> 00:30:46.270
You had said you could
do anything for a year.

00:30:46.270 --> 00:30:46.520
RYAN WALSH: Oh yeah.

00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:48.230
AUDIENCE: My memory
is you've been

00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:50.610
working on this a long time,
as long as I've known you.

00:30:50.610 --> 00:30:51.859
RYAN WALSH: That's true, yeah.

00:30:51.859 --> 00:30:53.852
AUDIENCE: And I wondered how--

00:30:53.852 --> 00:30:55.560
did you have an agent
from the beginning?

00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:57.837
Or did you just believe in
this and shop it around?

00:30:57.837 --> 00:30:59.670
I don't know if you
want to talk about that.

00:30:59.670 --> 00:31:01.050
RYAN WALSH: Oh, sure.

00:31:01.050 --> 00:31:02.700
I mean, you're
right, in a way, I

00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:06.090
have been working on
it since like, 2014.

00:31:06.090 --> 00:31:08.730
But it was in patches.

00:31:08.730 --> 00:31:12.660
It was the article, and then
there was the book proposal.

00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:16.560
Like the bulk of the real book
was a year, year and a half.

00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:18.180
But you're right,
it did stretch on.

00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:20.370
Basically, the process
of how this happened

00:31:20.370 --> 00:31:24.690
was the article came out in
"Boston Magazine" about Van

00:31:24.690 --> 00:31:27.450
on the run from the
mob here in Boston.

00:31:27.450 --> 00:31:29.520
And people really
enjoyed that article,

00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:31.851
passed it around a lot.

00:31:31.851 --> 00:31:34.350
And I was headed up to Vermont
with the band to play a show.

00:31:34.350 --> 00:31:35.610
We stopped for gas.

00:31:35.610 --> 00:31:37.830
I checked my email,
and there was an email

00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:40.110
from an editor at Penguin.

00:31:40.110 --> 00:31:42.540
And he said, I know
a lot of editors

00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:44.910
must be reaching
out to you, but I

00:31:44.910 --> 00:31:48.450
used to have a column called
"Astral Weeks" about sci-fi.

00:31:48.450 --> 00:31:50.310
Just talk to me first.

00:31:50.310 --> 00:31:52.950
And I was like, oh yeah,
a lot of editors are--

00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:57.190
just kind of fibbed about
that, which wasn't the case.

00:31:57.190 --> 00:32:00.060
But didn't need
to do any of that,

00:32:00.060 --> 00:32:05.340
because Ed was so enthusiastic,
and really ushered me

00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:06.180
through the process.

00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:09.810
He co-founded "The Believer"
magazine, if anyone knows that.

00:32:09.810 --> 00:32:12.780
And he's a wonderful
novelist and editor,

00:32:12.780 --> 00:32:16.013
and that's kind of
how it all happened.

00:32:16.013 --> 00:32:19.060
AUDIENCE: Has
indirectly any word

00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:20.860
come back Van Morrison's camp?

00:32:20.860 --> 00:32:24.340
RYAN WALSH: No, not at all.

00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:25.810
I mean, he really
stonewalled me.

00:32:25.810 --> 00:32:28.360
I mean, at the end,
I was so desperate,

00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:31.000
we did like a social
media campaign

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.160
where it like,
tweet Van Morrison

00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:36.340
if you think he should talk
to me for like, five minutes.

00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:38.020
I've talked to
every single living

00:32:38.020 --> 00:32:39.520
person who played
on "Astral Weeks,"

00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:42.130
or had something to do with
"Astral Weeks" except Van.

00:32:42.130 --> 00:32:44.770
And all that accomplished
was annoying his social media

00:32:44.770 --> 00:32:46.030
manager.

00:32:46.030 --> 00:32:49.675
It's probably some 18-year-old
named Cory who's just like,

00:32:49.675 --> 00:32:52.090
who the hell is this kid?

00:32:52.090 --> 00:32:54.190
So no, no word
from Van Morrison.

00:32:54.190 --> 00:32:56.307
Although "Rolling Stone"
wrote a very nice piece

00:32:56.307 --> 00:32:58.390
about the book the other
day, and they pointed out

00:32:58.390 --> 00:33:00.700
that the same week
the book came out,

00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:02.530
Van just announced a new album.

00:33:02.530 --> 00:33:05.590
And on that album is a cover
of a song from "Astral Weeks."

00:33:05.590 --> 00:33:08.860
So if there's anything
that's the equivalent

00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:15.010
of a sub-tweet on an album, that
could be interpreted as at FU

00:33:15.010 --> 00:33:16.090
to me.

00:33:16.090 --> 00:33:18.045
But I am not willing
to put that on record,

00:33:18.045 --> 00:33:20.380
because it does make me
sound a little crazy.

00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:22.690
AUDIENCE: Were there
topics that you've

00:33:22.690 --> 00:33:26.786
tried to approach that
doors were closed?

00:33:26.786 --> 00:33:29.196
Like, is there any
lines of questioning

00:33:29.196 --> 00:33:31.847
you wish you would have
played out where someone was

00:33:31.847 --> 00:33:33.534
like, no, we're not going there

00:33:33.534 --> 00:33:35.620
RYAN WALL: Certain people
went off the record

00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:36.610
about certain stories.

00:33:36.610 --> 00:33:42.370
I mean, where it got hairy for
me was trying to figure out

00:33:42.370 --> 00:33:46.240
why Mel Lyman, the leader
of the Fort Hill community--

00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:48.220
what actually happened
to him, because there

00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:49.900
was no death certificate.

00:33:49.900 --> 00:33:53.585
They say he died in '78,
didn't tell anybody till '85,

00:33:53.585 --> 00:33:55.210
and were just very
mysterious about it.

00:33:55.210 --> 00:33:59.410
And I thought any time I
brought that up, it became

00:33:59.410 --> 00:34:03.610
a cold awkward conversation.

00:34:03.610 --> 00:34:08.409
Look, I don't enjoy putting
people in awkward positions,

00:34:08.409 --> 00:34:11.830
but at the same time, it's a
pretty straightforward answer,

00:34:11.830 --> 00:34:14.150
what happened to your
friend, you know?

00:34:14.150 --> 00:34:18.632
AUDIENCE: '68 is a pivotal
year across the board

00:34:18.632 --> 00:34:22.118
for the whole country
in many different ways.

00:34:22.118 --> 00:34:27.845
Have you [INAUDIBLE] other 50
anniversary year books coming

00:34:27.845 --> 00:34:31.082
out or things like that, are
you joined to the community

00:34:31.082 --> 00:34:32.576
of people around that?

00:34:32.576 --> 00:34:34.730
RYAN WALSH: I'm not,
not in any sense.

00:34:34.730 --> 00:34:39.590
But when I was talking
about how long this took me,

00:34:39.590 --> 00:34:43.639
we did know we wanted it
to come out early 2018.

00:34:43.639 --> 00:34:46.310
Because certainly, by
the end of this year,

00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:49.030
we're going to be exhausted
of looking at 50 years ago.

00:34:49.030 --> 00:34:52.040
I joked with everybody
that by the time you're 30,

00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:55.460
you've accidentally seen a dozen
documentaries about the '60s

00:34:55.460 --> 00:34:57.500
without even trying.

00:34:57.500 --> 00:35:01.230
But what I had noted was that
it's all Chicago, New York,

00:35:01.230 --> 00:35:02.390
and San Francisco.

00:35:02.390 --> 00:35:09.200
Those are the Beats,
fire-powered DNC, Warhol.

00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:10.700
And then what's
happening in Boston?

00:35:10.700 --> 00:35:14.810
So what I found was that
it was just as interesting,

00:35:14.810 --> 00:35:17.780
perhaps not as glamorous,
definitely weirder.

00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:23.810
So I hope people have a
little more fuel in the tank

00:35:23.810 --> 00:35:26.686
to explore late '60s America.

00:35:26.686 --> 00:35:29.610
AUDIENCE: You seem to
suggest that the year that

00:35:29.610 --> 00:35:34.990
began around '68 in Boston
ended about five years ago.

00:35:34.990 --> 00:35:35.740
RYAN WALSH: Right.

00:35:35.740 --> 00:35:37.300
AUDIENCE: So what are you
alluding there [INAUDIBLE]??

00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:39.841
RYAN WALSH: Well, I mean, the
simple closing of "The Phoenix"

00:35:39.841 --> 00:35:43.990
and BCN are pretty
good indicators.

00:35:43.990 --> 00:35:46.420
They had a 50-year run.

00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:49.840
Those were the arms of
the Boston counterculture.

00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:52.780
And "Boston Magazine"
ran an article last year,

00:35:52.780 --> 00:35:54.690
does Boston have an
underground anymore?

00:35:54.690 --> 00:35:56.170
Is there still a counterculture?

00:35:56.170 --> 00:35:57.628
So people are asking
this question.

00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:05.830
But yeah, I mean, it
was amazing to find--

00:36:05.830 --> 00:36:08.530
like I said, my band
has performed on BCN

00:36:08.530 --> 00:36:11.470
before it closed, shut down.

00:36:11.470 --> 00:36:13.720
I got my start writing
in "The Phoenix."

00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:16.150
To realize where the precise
beginning of all that

00:36:16.150 --> 00:36:19.240
was a real honor to me.

00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:21.880
But yeah, I do feel like--

00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:26.530
without being dramatic--
it has come to a close.

00:36:26.530 --> 00:36:30.430
I'm never a pessimist, like
ah, the old days were better.

00:36:30.430 --> 00:36:32.380
Something probably
more interesting

00:36:32.380 --> 00:36:34.337
is right around the corner.

00:36:34.337 --> 00:36:37.199
AUDIENCE: Is there anything in
the book about the gun control

00:36:37.199 --> 00:36:38.232
laws introduced in '68?

00:36:38.232 --> 00:36:39.107
RYAN WALSH: The what?

00:36:39.107 --> 00:36:40.538
AUDIENCE: Gun
control laws in '68?

00:36:40.538 --> 00:36:43.861
Is there any reference to that
at all, any ties from the--

00:36:43.861 --> 00:36:44.860
RYAN WALSH: There's not.

00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:48.760
No, I actually didn't
know about that.

00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:52.930
I knew things like, nationally
911 was introduced that year,

00:36:52.930 --> 00:36:55.850
or the rating system that
they applied to movies.

00:36:55.850 --> 00:36:59.330
But there's not much
gun play in the book,

00:36:59.330 --> 00:37:02.110
except for three
of the community

00:37:02.110 --> 00:37:05.290
members who eventually tried to
rob a bank in the early '70s.

00:37:08.750 --> 00:37:13.770
And at the Boston Tea Party,
Little Richard apparently,

00:37:13.770 --> 00:37:17.460
after he played a set, with
the audience still clapping

00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:19.820
for an encore, he was
already backstage,

00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:23.190
opened a glittering suitcase,
and deposited his gun

00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:25.960
on the table, and just patiently
waited for his payment,

00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:29.190
like as an indication,
you better pay me quick.

00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:31.020
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:31.020 --> 00:37:33.650
But no, what laws
were passed that year?

00:37:33.650 --> 00:37:35.520
AUDIENCE: It was
[INAUDIBLE] that passed

00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:38.166
the gun control measures.

00:37:38.166 --> 00:37:42.777
The ones that
[INAUDIBLE] in context

00:37:42.777 --> 00:37:46.148
[INAUDIBLE] I think it was.

00:37:46.148 --> 00:37:46.939
RYAN WALSH: Oh, OK.

00:37:46.939 --> 00:37:48.897
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
gun control laws history.

00:37:48.897 --> 00:37:50.860
I remember the 1968 thing.

00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:54.365
RYAN WALSH: OK, I'll
have to check it out.

00:37:54.365 --> 00:37:57.299
Cool, anything else?

00:37:57.299 --> 00:37:59.120
AUDIENCE: Do you have
[INAUDIBLE] planned?

00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:02.680
RYAN WALSH: I have some ideas,
but we'll see what happens.

00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:05.010
I mean, this just
came out a week ago.

00:38:05.010 --> 00:38:09.050
So now I have to go promote
it, which is a joy for me.

00:38:09.050 --> 00:38:13.320
Because I like talking about
stories and meeting folks.

00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:16.262
So I would change it up.

00:38:16.262 --> 00:38:16.970
I don't want to--

00:38:19.580 --> 00:38:21.440
I love Boston, I've
always lived here,

00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:24.530
but I do think I've
drenched everything

00:38:24.530 --> 00:38:26.810
from what I want
to talk about here

00:38:26.810 --> 00:38:29.000
from the city with this book.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:33.380
So yeah, I hope you all like
it, and thanks for coming.

00:38:33.380 --> 00:38:35.152
Have a great day at Google.

00:38:35.152 --> 00:38:35.996
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:35.996 --> 00:38:36.276
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:38:36.276 --> 00:38:36.776
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:36.776 --> 00:38:39.660
RYAN WALSH: I used Google
so much writing this book,

00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:42.400
so thank you very much.
