You are listening to radio lab radio lash

2
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.650
fromW , n y.

3
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.540
S. E. N. N. P. E. R. Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich.

4
00:00:15.541 --> 00:00:17.280
This is radio lab, the podcast.

5
00:00:17.281 --> 00:00:21.710
And today a story about facing, how would you put it? Uh,

6
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.630
facing your boogeyman. Yeah,

7
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:29.520
but in this case I literally almost almost,

8
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.420
it comes to us from, Ah, Matt, you ready? Yeah. From reporter Matthew kilty.

9
00:00:33.421 --> 00:00:37.950
Steve, yes. And another guy. How are you doing? I'd never been better. So Matt,

10
00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:39.750
I don't know exactly how we're going to start this story,

11
00:00:39.751 --> 00:00:43.770
but maybe just introduce us to this guy. So this guy's Steve Volk,

12
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.910
he's a reporter, a city reporter here in Philadelphia. I write about ports,

13
00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.830
crime, politics,

14
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.270
but the thing that I read was a personal story of Steve's story starts with

15
00:00:54.271 --> 00:00:58.110
Steve and his early twenties and one night he goes to sleep, right?

16
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.300
So I have this dream

17
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.610
<v 1>where I wake up in my apartment,</v>

18
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:08.810
there's nobody there but me and I'm just sort of pacing around the rooms and I

19
00:01:10.141 --> 00:01:12.870
feel that sort of that kind of, um,

20
00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.280
tremor or buzz almost. It's something bad's about to happen,

21
00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.490
<v 0>feeling when like the walls kind of close in on you a little bit.</v>

22
00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.490
I could just feel that something's about to happen.

23
00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.210
And I look over at the window and there's this face,

24
00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:31.563
<v 2>yes,</v>

25
00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:34.310
<v 0>outside his window.</v>

26
00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.340
This man just hovering there and then he sort of recedes back in the dark.

27
00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.550
<v 2>It comes back [inaudible]</v>

28
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.630
<v 0>and so it sort of Bob up to where I could see it and then recede back into the</v>

29
00:01:53.631 --> 00:01:57.890
distance. And it was very, very, um, threatening.

30
00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.890
Yeah. I don't know what's happening. I just think that this,

31
00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.170
this person's trying to scare me, intimidate me. So he waits there for a minute

32
00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:13.360
and a moment later, Steve, here's this,

33
00:02:13.361 --> 00:02:18.280
not, oh, you got his front door. He knows immediately it's this guy.

34
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.070
And so I start hollering using every expletive I know, you know,

35
00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.210
you're going to, you're going to scare me.

36
00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.660
<v 3>I start daring him to Klinean so I can kill him.</v>

37
00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.660
And I have this rage that, uh, you know, I don't,

38
00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.250
I don't know that I've ever really felt in real life so much rage that it made

39
00:02:37.251 --> 00:02:40.700
me feel sick. He's just screaming at the door over and over,

40
00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.170
come in here so I can kill you. I was really violent. And then all of a sudden

41
00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.690
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

42
00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.500
<v 0>this guy just kicks open the door and we fly out</v>

43
00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:57.440
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

44
00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.860
<v 3>we're both swinging and each other.</v>

45
00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:06.363
<v 2>And then</v>

46
00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.240
I wake up literally with my fist,

47
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.111
<v 0>you know,</v>

48
00:03:13.111 --> 00:03:16.930
it might be hand balled into a fist and I've just thrown a punch at the air and

49
00:03:16.931 --> 00:03:21.900
he's in, he's in an just absolute panic. Very,

50
00:03:21.901 --> 00:03:24.390
very profoundly disturbing dream.

51
00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:27.570
<v 2>But it's just a tree. Yep.</v>

52
00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.760
<v 0>But the thing about this dream is that it wouldn't go away.</v>

53
00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.080
Meaning like anytime there was any sort of anxiety that flared up in his life,

54
00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:39.770
work, deadline, relationship, family troubles back again.

55
00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:41.990
And every time the same thing,

56
00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:46.760
this face that comes up out of the dark face, the window, the door, the fight,

57
00:03:46.761 --> 00:03:50.540
you know, I wanted it to go away. And so this is something, this,

58
00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:51.980
this persistent for how long?

59
00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.400
I would say I had this dream at least six times a year for about 20 years.

60
00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.980
20 years, 20 years. So he must have had it like hundreds of times. So yeah, I,

61
00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.330
it was a dream that I wanted to be done with and I wasn't sure how to be done

62
00:04:08.331 --> 00:04:11.240
with it. But a couple of years ago, Steve Starts working on this book,

63
00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:16.010
basically looking at things that are kind of out there on the edge of science,

64
00:04:16.011 --> 00:04:19.010
but he's looking at him in this objective, investigative way.

65
00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:22.820
And one of the things that he ends up bumping into is a lucid dreaming,

66
00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.660
lucid dreaming, lucid dreaming.

67
00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.780
So this is where like you wake up inside your dream, like you're awake,

68
00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.510
you're got, you're awake, you're present, you're aware,

69
00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:37.250
you can control what's happening in your dream. You, let me just ask you really,

70
00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.230
I mean, I've seen inception, I've heard people say that they have lucid dreams,

71
00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.330
but I just always assume those people just don't know what they're talking

72
00:04:44.331 --> 00:04:48.710
about, but they're actually referring to something else. Yeah, it seems crazy.

73
00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:53.150
And for a long time, western science denied. Lucid dreaming happened. Yeah.

74
00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.910
It didn't exist. But the more Steve looked into it,

75
00:04:55.911 --> 00:05:00.200
he realized that like the science behind this is real. Yeah.

76
00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:04.250
So sell me. We're going to start with this guy, Steven laberge.

77
00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:05.300
Stephen the Birch.

78
00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:09.620
So in the late seventies laberge goes to Stanford and wants to study

79
00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.440
consciousness. The reason he does is because he's actually,

80
00:05:12.441 --> 00:05:15.980
he's grown up his entire life claiming to have lucid dreams.

81
00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:19.200
He claims he's been controlling his dreams all his life. Yeah.

82
00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:22.190
But at the same time, he's also a scientist.

83
00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:27.470
He had to find a way to show people objectively that lucid dreaming exists.

84
00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:33.210
Oh wait, hold up. How would you even go about doing that? Because if,

85
00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:36.180
cause if it's a dream, it's only in your head.

86
00:05:36.181 --> 00:05:38.520
So how can you prove something that's only in your head?

87
00:05:38.521 --> 00:05:41.550
So that that actually takes us back to the Bourges advisor.

88
00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.280
A guy named William Demand Williams see demand demand,

89
00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:48.030
and he's conducting all of these sleep studies at the Stanford Sleep Science

90
00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:48.300
Center.

91
00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.930
And one of the things he noticed is when people go into this dream state with

92
00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.600
their eyes behind their eyelids, they begin to just start around like crazy.

93
00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:57.860
They go diagonally sideways.

94
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:02.570
Basically what we know is rem or rapid. I mean, right.

95
00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:07.130
But one day [inaudible] has this subject and he's watching this guy and this

96
00:06:07.131 --> 00:06:10.130
guy, his eyes, when he, when he goes into rem, out of nowhere,

97
00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:15.640
his eyes go from craziness to this like really slow controlled pattern left to

98
00:06:17.391 --> 00:06:21.680
right, left to right, left to right into men.

99
00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:25.430
I was so intrigued that he immediately went and woke them up and said,

100
00:06:25.431 --> 00:06:27.500
do you remember what you were dreaming? And they said, yeah,

101
00:06:27.501 --> 00:06:32.250
I was watching a ping pong match. But I'm pumped. Right? I mean,

102
00:06:32.251 --> 00:06:36.900
it sounds like a joke. Um, but for Laberge, this is like a total revelation.

103
00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:38.070
I mean, think about it. If,

104
00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:41.520
if you are in a dream and you like wave your hands around and you shout,

105
00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:44.670
you're not moving or anything on me, you know, in the real world.

106
00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:47.610
But if you move your eyes in a dream,

107
00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:51.930
someone's sitting out there and the real world will actually see your eyes move.

108
00:06:51.931 --> 00:06:56.020
They'll see that it's like this little hidden line that you can use to call out

109
00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:59.230
from the dream world to the awake world.

110
00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.190
And so Stephen [inaudible] Burj figures. Okay.

111
00:07:02.191 --> 00:07:07.191
What I'm going to do then is have somebody monitor me while I sleep and once,

112
00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:10.560
um, I'm dreaming and become aware that I'm dreaming,

113
00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:14.750
I will issue too smooth,

114
00:07:14.751 --> 00:07:17.420
controlled eye movements. In other words,

115
00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:20.860
I'm going to go to sleep and when I become lucid in my dream, I'm going to move.

116
00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:24.570
Yeah. My eyes left right, left, right.

117
00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:26.670
And then you out here in the real world,

118
00:07:26.671 --> 00:07:31.230
you'll see my eyes actually move left, right, left,

119
00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:35.790
right. And that way you'll know that I am lucid in my dream.

120
00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:38.040
[inaudible] controlling what's going on. It's pretty cool.

121
00:07:38.041 --> 00:07:40.640
So liberty gets all hooked up to the machines and uh,

122
00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:45.480
his assistant sits there watching his eyes go all crazy and then suddenly

123
00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:49.770
instead of Herky jerky movement, his assistant sees smooth,

124
00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:54.060
controlled movements. Left, right, left, right,

125
00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:55.403
left,

126
00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:58.760
right the same pattern they had agreed on exact same pattern and they were sure

127
00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:02.150
that verge was deepest sleep during this pattern making. Yeah. Yeah.

128
00:08:02.151 --> 00:08:03.680
They were watching. They were watching on the, uh,

129
00:08:03.681 --> 00:08:08.681
the EEG machines that he was in a deep sleep when he made that pattern signal.

130
00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:14.000
So he was conscious while he was unconscious is what you're saying? Correct.

131
00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:18.470
He was lucid. Okay. And he was able to repeat this? Yeah, he,

132
00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:21.710
he went on and uh, ended up replicating this with a lot of other people.

133
00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:24.830
He published it. Yeah. He published it like in a journal.

134
00:08:24.831 --> 00:08:27.240
Not In like not just on the web. Yup. Wow.

135
00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:31.590
And you won't find at this stage you won't really find credible dream

136
00:08:31.591 --> 00:08:34.770
researchers denying the reality of lucid dreaming.

137
00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:37.370
So you will find them ignoring it. Routine. Yeah.

138
00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:40.990
Steve gets in touch with laberge who turns out he's doing these workshops now,

139
00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:45.640
teaching people how to have lucid dreams, how to have lucid dreams on command.

140
00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:48.130
This is something you can learn. You can learn how to do this. Yeah.

141
00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:51.940
La Berge has discovered a lot of different techniques for this.

142
00:08:51.941 --> 00:08:54.790
He's got techniques. What are the techniques? So first of all,

143
00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:59.670
to lucid in a dream, you have to realize in the dream that you're dreaming. Yes.

144
00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:04.050
Which is kind of like how do you, how do you do that in a dream? You actually,

145
00:09:04.051 --> 00:09:07.620
what you do is you, you practice in the waking world,

146
00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:12.280
you become hyper aware of certain things that work differently in the dream

147
00:09:12.281 --> 00:09:16.160
world than they do in the waking world. Like what one of the most, uh,

148
00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:19.350
easy for people to follow is, um,

149
00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:23.400
print like text when you're awake. Text is text,

150
00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:28.560
but texting and dream changes really dramatically from moment to moment.

151
00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:33.590
Right now there's a view sonic monitor across from me and when I look away from

152
00:09:34.831 --> 00:09:38.370
it and look back, it still says you sonic. However,

153
00:09:38.371 --> 00:09:41.760
in a dream when you look away from it, because it has no external reality.

154
00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:46.440
When you look back, it could be anything. It could be nuclear launch codes,

155
00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:48.510
it could be poetry.

156
00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:52.470
The point of all this is to zero in on things that make you question,

157
00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:55.260
am I awake or am I dreaming? It's called a state test.

158
00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:58.770
And what ends up happening if you start doing this in real life is you end up

159
00:09:58.771 --> 00:09:59.820
being in a dream.

160
00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:03.120
And because you've asked yourself this question a dozen times that day,

161
00:10:03.121 --> 00:10:07.530
am I awake or am I dreaming that that thought will occur to you in the dream?

162
00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:09.600
And if it does that might,

163
00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:13.320
that might open the door to actually becoming aware,

164
00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:17.610
taking control. Man, you are more than halfway there at that point.

165
00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:21.600
So Stevie started trying all this out, doing all these state tests,

166
00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:23.070
but it wasn't really working.

167
00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:27.930
So he ended up calling the Burj his assistant and I called her and we talked

168
00:10:27.931 --> 00:10:30.760
through different techniques in the book and then we talked about this

169
00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:32.640
nightmare. And when she heard about his nightmare,

170
00:10:32.641 --> 00:10:36.030
she actually suggested a different technique in waking life.

171
00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:41.330
Imagine the dream as it happened and then find the point at which you would like

172
00:10:43.411 --> 00:10:45.980
to gain lucidity. Something happens,

173
00:10:45.981 --> 00:10:49.770
something shifts and this is the point where you'd like to become lucid.

174
00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:53.940
And he decided when the face first appears in the window. That's the moment,

175
00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:57.690
that very specific moment when I want to gain awareness.

176
00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:03.560
And so I would imagine myself doing this over and over face awareness face,

177
00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:10.400
oh awareness. And then one night he goes to sleep.

178
00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:14.340
<v 1>Um, I'm walking through my apartment, nobody there but me.</v>

179
00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:19.830
And I feel that sort of familiar buzz of anticipation.

180
00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:22.440
Something bad's about to happen and

181
00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:25.260
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

182
00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:29.970
<v 0>into the window and there's the guy just like usual, but this time he says,</v>

183
00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:31.103
I was there.

184
00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:36.910
You're there and then suddenly you're there. Yeah.

185
00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:41.380
It's like my perspective shifts and I am in this body,

186
00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:46.690
in this place, not observing something but in it.

187
00:11:47.890 --> 00:11:48.723
So I could,

188
00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:54.040
<v 1>you know, my fingers tickling my palms, I could feel my</v>

189
00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:55.540
<v 3>feet on the floor.</v>

190
00:11:56.230 --> 00:12:00.670
I locked into these feelings because they make the dream more stable.

191
00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:05.440
And I wanted this dream to be stable because this face has been showing up in

192
00:12:05.441 --> 00:12:09.890
this window for 20 years and it's, it does its thing.

193
00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:14.370
It recedes it, it comes back and

194
00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:22.270
I go to the door and I reached for the door and the handle is a door handle.

195
00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:25.310
It feels that real. And I turned it in

196
00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:29.643
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

197
00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:33.340
<v 3>a moment or two later, the guy appears in the Norway</v>

198
00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:41.060
and there is this moment where we look at each other face to face and he's this

199
00:12:41.341 --> 00:12:45.780
total nondescript guy really like any old beer drinking dude.

200
00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:51.140
So he looks at me and he's clearly perplexed because we're not going through our

201
00:12:52.171 --> 00:12:56.100
usual dance, you know, and I kind of backed up to give him room.

202
00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.660
Guy Walks in and we're standing there looking at each other.

203
00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:06.870
And I hadn't thought about what I would actually say,

204
00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:11.010
I just, I just thought I'd let him in. What does the Guy Do?

205
00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:14.340
Well, he pulled out a gun

206
00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:17.300
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

207
00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:19.790
<v 3>at this point when he pulls this gun out,</v>

208
00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:22.670
the whole dream in this moment now becomes, for me,

209
00:13:22.671 --> 00:13:25.610
it kind of battle between what I know to be true,

210
00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:28.610
which is that this is a dream and it has no external reality.

211
00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:33.590
And the natural feelings of fear that crop up when somebody who's already been

212
00:13:33.591 --> 00:13:35.180
terrorizing you for 20 years is now

213
00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:37.620
<v 2>[inaudible].</v>

214
00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:40.170
<v 3>And he is really carefully looking at me</v>

215
00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:45.560
like waiting for me to go back to my normal reaction.

216
00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:51.020
So he pulls the gun at, uh,

217
00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:55.640
up now and points it at me looking at me like, okay,

218
00:13:55.641 --> 00:13:59.270
now are you going to do what you usually do now? Are you afraid?

219
00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:04.690
And in my head, just like, it's a dream. It's a dream. It's a dream.

220
00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:06.910
It's a dream. And so I just stand there.

221
00:14:09.290 --> 00:14:10.123
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

222
00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:11.380
<v 3>And he starts firing</v>

223
00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:15.273
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

224
00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:18.390
<v 3>my first reaction is to look down at myself, right.</v>

225
00:14:18.391 --> 00:14:22.320
To look at my chest and my stomach. And I can see that my,

226
00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:25.463
<v 2>it's just sort of</v>

227
00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:28.170
<v 3>billowing with each [inaudible]</v>

228
00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:31.460
<v 2>that with</v>

229
00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:36.850
each bullet there's, there's no

230
00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:39.850
<v 3>blood, there is no nothing. I'm not, I'm not hurting.</v>

231
00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:45.460
I am taking this and it's, and it's nothing.

232
00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:49.980
I really feel, and I had this tried at the time on

233
00:14:55.650 --> 00:14:57.710
<v 2>I am superman,</v>

234
00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:03.090
this guy's firing bullets at me.

235
00:15:06.850 --> 00:15:11.390
[inaudible] I look up at him

236
00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:14.270
and he sort of looks at me

237
00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:19.720
<v 3>and then he smiles and drops the gun by his side.</v>

238
00:15:22.290 --> 00:15:25.860
And the sensation I had was like, that message was like, see, you got it.

239
00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:30.580
You got it. I'm nothing to be afraid of at all.

240
00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:36.300
And I woke up still feeling like neo still feeling like superman and I have

241
00:15:37.781 --> 00:15:42.760
never had that dream. It's never had it again. It's gone. It's gone,

242
00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:44.140
and a dream is gone.

243
00:15:47.610 --> 00:15:52.120
<v 2>Well, thank you, Matt.</v>

244
00:15:52.650 --> 00:15:53.483
Sure.

245
00:15:55.070 --> 00:15:57.050
<v 0>Thanks. Also to Steve Volk has book,</v>

246
00:15:57.540 --> 00:16:00.080
which goes into much more detail on lucid dreaming and many other things.

247
00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:01.520
It's called fringe geology.

248
00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:04.850
This puts me in mind if I have a solution to a problem.

249
00:16:04.851 --> 00:16:06.680
I've had enough for several years, you know,

250
00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:10.190
like me beating up on you and your dreams. I should've just waited it out.

251
00:16:10.191 --> 00:16:12.530
Really? I should've said, yeah, go ahead. Stab me. See,

252
00:16:12.531 --> 00:16:13.910
now I'll never hurt you again. I mean,

253
00:16:13.911 --> 00:16:18.020
this is something that everybody can take home and use tonight. I'm Jad Abumrad.

254
00:16:18.021 --> 00:16:19.520
I'm Robert Krulwich. Thanks for listening.
