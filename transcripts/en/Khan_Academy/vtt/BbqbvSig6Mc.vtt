00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.720
A lot of what we do with Laplace
transforms, taking

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.070
them and taking their
inverse, it's a

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:06.260
lot of pattern matching.

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:08.380
And it shouldn't just be a
mechanical thing, and that's

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:10.130
why I've gone through the
exercise of showing

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:11.270
you why they work.

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:13.650
But in order to just kind of
make sure we don't get

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.370
confused, I think it might be
useful to review a little bit

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:17.890
of everything that we've
learned so far.

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.070
So in the last video, we saw
that the Laplace transform--

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:22.760
well, let me just
write something.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.930
The Laplace transform of f of
t, let me just get some

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.210
notation down, and we can write
that as big capital F of

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.210
s, and I've told you
that before.

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.090
And so given that, in the last
video I showed you that if we

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.960
have to deal with the unit step
function, so if I said,

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.810
look, the Laplace transform of
the unit step function, it

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:49.690
becomes 1 at some value c times
some shifted function f

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.420
of t minus c, in the last video,
we saw that this is

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:01.530
just equal to e to the minus cs
times the Laplace transform

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.079
of just this function right
there, so times the F of s.

00:01:08.005 --> 00:01:10.780
And it's really important not
to get this confused with

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.530
another Laplace transform
property or rule, or whatever

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.310
you want to call it, that
we figured out.

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.840
I think it was one of the videos
that I made last year,

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.690
but if you're just following
these in order I think it's

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.870
three or four videos ago.

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:31.000
And that one told us that the
Laplace transform of e to the

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:40.710
at, times f of t, that this is
equal to-- and I want to make

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.340
this distinction very clear.

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.740
Here we shifted the f of t
and we got just kind of a

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.580
regular F of s.

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.660
In this situation, when we
multiply it times a e to the

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:57.480
positive at, we end up shifting
the actual transform.

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.480
So this becomes F
of s minus a.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.720
And these two rules, or
properties, or whatever you

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.690
want to call them, they're
very easy to

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:07.750
confuse with each other.

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.509
So we're going to do a couple
of examples that we're going

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.040
to have to figure out which
one of these two apply.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.350
Let's write all the other stuff
that we learned as well.

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.740
The very first thing we learned
was that the Laplace

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.740
transform of 1 was
equal to 1/s.

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.270
We know that that's a pretty
straightforward one, easy to

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:25.320
prove to yourself.

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.930
And more generally, we learned
that the Laplace transform of

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:34.330
t to the n, where n is a
positive integer, it equaled n

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:42.120
factorial over s to
the n plus 1.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.500
And then we had our
trig functions

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.150
that we've gone over.

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.340
Let me do this in a
different color.

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:50.130
I'll do it right here.

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:58.980
The Laplace transform of sine
of at is equal to a over s

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.530
squared, plus a squared.

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:08.760
And the Laplace transform of the
cosine of at is equal to s

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.660
over s squared plus a squared.

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.330
And you'll be amazed by how far
we can go with just what

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.980
I've written here.

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.020
In future videos, we're going
to broaden our toolkit even

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.610
further, but just these right
here, you can already do a

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.170
whole set of Laplace transforms
and inverse Laplace

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.330
transforms. So let's
try to do a few.

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.435
So let's say I were to give
you the Laplace transform.

00:03:30.435 --> 00:03:32.410
And you know, this is
just the hard part.

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.830
I think you know how to solve
a differential equation, if

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:36.360
you know how to take the
Laplace transforms

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.240
and go back and forth.

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.860
The hard part is just
recognizing or inverting your

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.640
Laplace transforms. So let's
say we had the Laplace

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.760
transform of some
function F of s.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:56.260
Let's say it's 3 factorial over
s minus 2 to the fourth.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.210
Now, your pattern matching, or
your pattern recognition part

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:01.810
of your brain, should
immediately say, look, I have

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.880
a Laplace transform of something
that has a factorial

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.860
in it, and it's over
an exponent.

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.770
This must be something
related to this

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:10.540
thing right here, right?

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.240
If I just had the Laplace
transform-- let me write that

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:18.670
down-- the Laplace transform
of-- you see a 3 factorial and

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:22.380
a fourth power, so it looks
like n is equal to 3.

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:28.200
So if you write the Laplace
transform of t to the 3, this

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.530
rule that we showed right here,
this means that it would

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:38.550
be equal to 3 factorial
over s to the fourth.

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.430
Now, this thing isn't
exactly this thing.

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.530
They're not quite
the same thing.

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.150
You know, I'm doing this to
instruct you, but I find

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.210
these, when I'm actually doing
them on an exam-- I remember

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.370
when I did them when I first
learned this, I would actually

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.290
go through this step because you
definitely don't want to

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:56.690
make a careless mistake and you
definitely want to make

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:58.610
sure you have a good handle
on what you're doing.

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:00.970
So you're like, OK, it's
something related to this, but

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:04.780
what's the difference between
this expression right here and

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.020
the expression that we're trying
to take the inverse

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.720
Laplace transform of,
and this one here?

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.310
Well, we've shifted our s.

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:22.600
If we call this expression right
here F of s, then what's

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.110
this expression?

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:28.200
This expression right here
is F of s minus 2.

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:34.410
So what are we dealing
with here?

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:38.730
So you see here, you have
a shifted F of s.

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:43.760
So in this case, a would
be equal to 2.

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:48.180
So this is the Laplace transform
of e to the at times

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:51.390
our f of t.

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:52.660
So let me write this down.

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:57.850
This is the Laplace transform
of e to the-- and what's a?

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:00.440
a is what we shifted by.

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.170
It's what we shifted by minus
a, so you have a positive a,

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:08.060
so e to the 2t times the
actual function.

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:10.415
If this was just an F of s,
what would f of t be?

00:06:10.415 --> 00:06:15.550
Well, we figured out, it's t the
3, t to the third power.

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:19.260
So the Laplace transform of
this is equal to that.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:25.250
Or we could write that the
inverse Laplace transform of 3

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:31.600
factorial over s minus 2 to the
fourth is equal to e to

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:35.300
the 2t times t to the third.

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:39.420
Now, if that seemed confusing
to you, you

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:40.670
can kind of go forward.

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:45.730
Let's go the other direction,
and maybe this will make it a

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:47.250
little bit clearer for you.

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:48.570
So let's go from
this direction.

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:51.390
If I have to take the Laplace
transform of this thing, I'd

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:53.370
say, OK, well, the Laplace
transform of t to

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:54.620
the third is easy.

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:00.570
I think the tool isn't working
right there properly.

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:02.630
Let me scroll up a little bit.

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:04.540
So I could write
it right here.

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:08.385
So if I wanted to figure out the
Laplace transform of e to

00:07:08.385 --> 00:07:12.600
the 2t times t to the third,
I'll say, well, you know, this

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:14.950
e to the 2t, I remember that
it shifts something.

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:20.050
So if I know that the Laplace
transform of t the third, this

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:20.810
is an easy one.

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:25.710
It's equal to 3 factorial
over s to the fourth.

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:27.160
That's 3 plus 1.

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:30.780
Then the Laplace transform of e
to the 2t times t the third

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:32.650
is going to be this shifted.

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:35.570
This is equal to F of s.

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:41.600
Then this is going to
be f of s minus 2.

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:43.550
So what's F of s minus 2?

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:49.550
It's going to be equal to 3
factorial over s minus 2 to

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:50.580
the fourth.

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:52.420
I think you're already getting
an appreciation that the

00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:55.480
hardest thing about these
Laplace transform problems are

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:58.380
really kind of all of these
shifts and kind of recognizing

00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:01.410
the patterns and recognizing
what's your a, and what's your

00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:04.220
c, and being very careful about
it so you don't make a

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:05.070
careless mistake.

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:07.430
And I think doing a lot of
examples probably helps a lot,

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:11.500
so let's do a couple of more
to kind of make sure things

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:14.710
really get hammered home
in your brain.

00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:16.840
So let's try this
one right here.

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:19.640
This looks a little bit
more complicated.

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:23.030
They give us that the Laplace
transform of some function is

00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:32.070
equal to 2 times s minus 1 times
e to the minus 2s, all

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:39.940
of that over s squared
minus 2s plus 2.

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:41.600
Now this looks very daunting.

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:41.990
How do you do this?

00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:42.680
I have an e here.

00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:44.049
I have something shifted here.

00:08:44.049 --> 00:08:47.260
I have this polynomial in
the denominator here.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:48.720
What can I do with this?

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:51.080
So the first thing, when I look
at these polynomials in

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:53.620
the denominator, I say can
I factor it somehow?

00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:55.800
Can I factor it fairly simply?

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:58.830
And actually, in the exams
that you'll find in

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:00.280
differential equation class,
they'll never give you

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:03.920
something that's factorable
into these weird numbers.

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:05.240
It tends to be integers.

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:07.200
So you see, OK, what
two numbers?

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:09.060
They have to be positive.

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:10.990
When you give their product,
you get 2.

00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:13.430
And then when you add them, you
get negative 2, or they

00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:14.750
could both be negative.

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:17.360
But there's no two easy
numbers, not 1 and 2.

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:18.800
None of those work.

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:21.820
So if you can't factor this
outright, the next idea is

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:24.290
maybe we could complete the
square and maybe this will

00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:26.470
match one of the cosine
or the sine formulas.

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:29.280
So how can we complete the
square in this denominator?

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:38.640
Well, this can be rewritten
as s squared minus 2s.

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:42.010
And I'm going to put
a plus 2 out here.

00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:44.230
And you can watch, I have
a bunch of videos on the

00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:45.650
completing of the square,
if all of this

00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:46.830
looks foreign to you.

00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:49.090
And to complete the square, we
just want to turn this into a

00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:50.130
perfect square.

00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:54.850
So to turn this into a perfect
square-- so something when I

00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:58.720
add it to itself twice becomes
minus 2, and so that when I

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:03.030
square it, when I add it to
itself twice, it becomes minus

00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:04.300
2, it's minus 1.

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:07.700
And when I square it,
it'll become plus 1.

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:10.160
I can't just add plus 1
arbitrarily to some

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:11.650
expression, I have to
make it neutral.

00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:12.920
So let me subtract 1.

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:13.730
I haven't changed this.

00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:15.630
I added 1 and I subtracted 1.

00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:17.890
A little bit of a primer on
completing the square.

00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:21.610
But by doing this, I now can
call this expression right

00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:27.780
here, I can now say that this
thing is s minus 1 squared.

00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:32.430
And then this stuff out here,
this out here is 2 minus 1.

00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:34.410
This is just plus 1.

00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:41.100
So I can rewrite my entire
expression now as 2 times s

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:45.560
minus 1 times e to the minus
2s-- make sure I'm not

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:51.420
clipping off at the top-- e to
the minus 2s, all of that over

00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:56.620
s minus 1 squared plus 1.

00:10:56.620 --> 00:11:01.880
So a couple of interesting
things seem to

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:06.020
be happening here.

00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:09.710
Let's just do a couple of test
Laplace transforms. So if a

00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:15.610
Laplace transform of cosine of
t, we know that this is equal

00:11:15.610 --> 00:11:23.050
to s over s squared plus 1,
which this kind of looks like

00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:26.180
if this was an s and this
was an s squared plus 1.

00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:30.960
If this was F of s,
then what is this?

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:34.130
Well, let's ignore this guy
right here for a little bit.

00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:34.920
So what is it?

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:36.930
We know, actually, from
the last video.

00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:43.720
We saw, well, what if we took
the Laplace transform of e to

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:45.540
the-- I'll call it 1t.

00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:49.000
But let's say e to the-- yeah
I'll just write it e to the 1t

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.250
times cosine of t?

00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:55.410
Well, then this will just
shift this Laplace

00:11:55.410 --> 00:11:56.995
transform by 1.

00:11:56.995 --> 00:12:00.100
It will shift it by
1 to the right.

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:03.270
Wherever you see an s, you
would put an s minus a 1.

00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:08.900
So this will be equal to s
minus 1 over s minus 1

00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:11.200
squared plus 1.

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:13.270
We're getting close.

00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:18.390
We now figured out this
part right here.

00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:22.440
Now, in the previous video, I
think it was two videos ago,

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:25.040
or maybe it was the last
video, I forget.

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:27.000
Memory fails me.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.060
I showed you that if you have
the Laplace transform of the

00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:38.970
unit step function of t times
some f of t shifted by some

00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:50.160
value of c, then that this is
equal to e to the minus cs

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:54.260
times F of s.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:58.260
OK, And this can get
very confusing.

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.000
This can get very confusing,
so I want to be

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.290
very careful here.

00:13:01.290 --> 00:13:03.190
Let's ignore all of this.

00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:06.660
I called this F of s before, but
now I'm going to backtrack

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:07.130
a little bit.

00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:09.980
And let's just ignore this,
because I'm going to redefine

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:10.670
our F of s.

00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:12.670
So let's just ignore
that for a second.

00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:15.940
Let's define our new
f of t to be this.

00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:17.260
Let's say that that is f of t.

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:23.690
Let's say f of t is equal to
e to the t cosine of t.

00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:27.200
Then if you take the Laplace
transform of that, that means

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:35.850
that F of s is equal to s
minus 1 over s minus 1

00:13:35.850 --> 00:13:38.050
squared plus 1.

00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:39.040
Nothing fancy there.

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:41.190
I just defined our f of
t as this, and then

00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:44.400
our F of s is that.

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:48.390
Now, we have a situation here.

00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:49.880
Let's ignore the 2 here.

00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:52.410
The 2 is just kind of
a scaling factor.

00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:57.180
This expression right here, we
can rewrite as that expression

00:13:57.180 --> 00:13:59.610
is equal to-- this
is our F of s.

00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:05.600
This expression right here is
equal to 2 times our F of s

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:09.150
times e to the minus 2s.

00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:10.230
Or let me just write it.

00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:13.440
Let me switch the order, just
so we make it look right.

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:19.140
2 times e to the minus
2s times F of s.

00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:22.720
Well, that looks just like
this if our 2 was

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:23.970
equal to our c.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.570
So what does that tell us?

00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:31.590
That tells us that the inverse
Laplace transform, if we take

00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:33.660
the inverse Laplace
transform-- and

00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:37.060
let's ignore the 2.

00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:39.540
Let's do the inverse Laplace
transform of the whole thing.

00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:44.020
The inverse Laplace transform
of this thing is going to be

00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:47.070
equal to-- we can just write
the 2 there as a scaling

00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:52.000
factor, 2 there times
this thing times

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.010
the unit step function.

00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:56.580
What's our c?

00:14:56.580 --> 00:14:57.650
You can just pattern match.

00:14:57.650 --> 00:14:58.330
You have a 2 here.

00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:01.780
You have a c, a minus c,
a minus 2, so c is 2.

00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:06.380
The unit step function is zero
until it gets to 2 times t, or

00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:12.180
of t, so, then it becomes 1
after t is equal to 2, times

00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:19.110
our function shifted by 2.

00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:21.990
So this is our inverse
Laplace transform.

00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:24.950
Now, what was our function?

00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:29.140
Our function was this
thing right here.

00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:32.090
So if our inverse Laplace
transform of that thing that I

00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:38.170
had written is this thing, an
f of t, f of t is equal to e

00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:41.650
to the t cosine of t.

00:15:41.650 --> 00:15:44.370
Then our inverse-- let me
write all of this down.

00:15:44.370 --> 00:15:47.180
Let me write our big result.

00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:51.470
We established that the inverse
Laplace transform of

00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:55.300
that big thing that I had
written before, 2 times s

00:15:55.300 --> 00:16:05.890
minus 1 times e to the minus 2--
sorry, e to the minus 2s

00:16:05.890 --> 00:16:13.820
over s squared minus 2s plus 2
is equal to this thing where f

00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:14.770
of t is this.

00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:20.700
Or we could just rewrite this
as 2 times the unit step

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:24.130
function starting at 2, where
that's when it becomes

00:16:24.130 --> 00:16:28.630
non-zero of t times f of t minus
2. f of t minus 2 is

00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:32.190
this with t being replaced
by t minus 2.

00:16:32.190 --> 00:16:35.120
I'll do it in another color,
just to ease the monotony.

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:43.920
So it would be e to the t minus
2 cosine of t minus 2.

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:45.910
Now, you might be thinking, Sal,
you know, he must have

00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:47.990
taken all these baby steps with
this problem, because

00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:49.790
he's trying to explain
it to me.

00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:53.370
But I'm taking baby steps with
this problem so that I myself

00:16:53.370 --> 00:16:54.320
don't get confused.

00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:56.750
And I think it's essential
that you do

00:16:56.750 --> 00:16:58.110
take these baby steps.

00:16:58.110 --> 00:17:00.320
And let's just think about
what baby steps we took.

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:01.350
And I really want
to review this.

00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:02.800
This is actually a surprisingly
good problem.

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:05.930
I didn't realize it when I
first decided to do it.

00:17:05.930 --> 00:17:07.020
We solved this thing.

00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:09.930
We wanted to get this
denominator into some form

00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:14.560
that is vaguely useful to us,
so I completed the square

00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:17.940
there and then we rewrote
our Laplace transform,

00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:19.770
our f of s like this.

00:17:19.770 --> 00:17:21.339
And then we used a little
pattern recognition.

00:17:21.339 --> 00:17:23.869
We said, look, if I take the
Laplace transform of cosine of

00:17:23.869 --> 00:17:27.750
t, I'd get s over s
squared plus 1.

00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:29.500
But this isn't s over
s squared plus 1.

00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:33.180
It's s minus 1 over s minus
1 squared plus 1.

00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:36.450
So we said, oh, well, that means
that we're multiplying

00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:38.300
our original time
domain function.

00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:43.850
We're multiplying our f of
t times e to the 1t.

00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:46.200
And that's what we got there.

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:49.460
So the Laplace transform of e to
the t cosine of t became s

00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:53.180
minus 1 over s minus
1 squared plus 1.

00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:56.970
And then we had this e to the
minus 2s this entire time.

00:17:56.970 --> 00:18:01.470
And that's where we said, hey,
if we have e to the minus 2s

00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:04.610
in our Laplace transform, when
you take the inverse Laplace

00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:09.760
transform, it must be the step
function times the shifted

00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:11.020
version of that function.

00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:12.200
And that's why I was
very careful.

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:14.320
And you had this 2 hanging out
the whole time, and I could

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:15.030
have used that any time.

00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:19.710
But the simple constants
just scale.

00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:21.960
A function is equal to two times
the Laplace transform of

00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:23.410
that function and vice versa.

00:18:23.410 --> 00:18:25.250
So the 2's are very easy to
deal with, so I kind of

00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:27.470
ignored that most of the time.

00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:28.780
But that's why I was
very careful.

00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:34.420
I redefined f of t to be this,
F of s to be this, and said,

00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:39.920
gee, if F of s is this, and if
I'm multiplying it times e to

00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:45.040
the minus 2s, then what I'm
essentially doing, I'm fitting

00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:46.730
this pattern right here.

00:18:46.730 --> 00:18:49.070
And so the answer to my problem
is going to be the

00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:52.450
unit step function-- I just
throw the 2 out there-- the 2

00:18:52.450 --> 00:18:57.960
times the unit step function
times my f of t shifted by c.

00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:00.360
And we established this was
our f of t, so we just

00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:02.500
shifted it by c.

00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:05.570
We shifted it by 2, and we
got our final answer.

00:19:05.570 --> 00:19:09.220
So this is about as hard up to
this point as you'll see an

00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:11.780
inverse Laplace transform
problem.

00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:14.450
So, hopefully, you found that
pretty interesting.
