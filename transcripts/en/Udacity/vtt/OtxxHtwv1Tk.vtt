00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
We’re going to be talking about these quantities so much, let’s give them some abbreviations.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Position, I’m going to abbreviate with the variable X. And velocity, I'll use the variable V.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Now, we just said that measuring an object’s velocity

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
is somehow measuring how fast its position is changing.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Well, we can write that with an equation.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
This equation says that velocity is equal to the change in X over the change in time.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
The change in position over the change in time.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
This triangle here is the Greek letter delta, and it represents change. X represents position.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
This mathematical definition really ties in with our intuitive definition of what velocity means.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Before we go any further, let's also talk about how we're going to measure these quantities.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
What units are we going to use?

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
To measure position, we're going to use the unit meter, which we'll abbreviate to M.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
While velocity is just position, which is meters divided by some unit of time.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
And the unit of time we'd like to use is the second. So second. Meters per second.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
If we were Aristotle, we would stop here because if an object falls with constant velocity -

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
And velocity never changes. We don't really care about anything else.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Position and velocity seemed to be enough to quantify motion.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
But we're talking about Galileo and for him speed is constantly changing.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
This concept of changing speed is so important we give it its own word, acceleration.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
And we abbreviate that with A.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
And acceleration is a measure of how an object's velocity changes with time.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Just as velocity measure an object's positional change with time.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Using this idea that acceleration is change in velocity,

00:01:26.000 --> 99:59:59.000
can you complete this equation which defines acceleration?
