the problem YouTube's allowed me to be

00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:29.440
the problem YouTube's allowed me to be
 

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:32.190
the problem YouTube's allowed me to be
in a pilot program this year I was one

00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:32.200
in a pilot program this year I was one
 

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:34.380
in a pilot program this year I was one
of the few selected for this program

00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:34.390
of the few selected for this program
 

00:12:34.390 --> 00:12:37.680
of the few selected for this program
that allowed me to self rate the content

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:37.690
that allowed me to self rate the content
 

00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:40.020
that allowed me to self rate the content
in my videos which means that there's a

00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:40.030
in my videos which means that there's a
 

00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:42.600
in my videos which means that there's a
smaller chance that my videos would get

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:42.610
smaller chance that my videos would get
 

00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:45.540
smaller chance that my videos would get
demonetised because I can say well it's

00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:45.550
demonetised because I can say well it's
 

00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:47.670
demonetised because I can say well it's
still unlisted there's no excessive

00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:47.680
still unlisted there's no excessive
 

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:49.650
still unlisted there's no excessive
profanity or violence or any of that and

00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:49.660
profanity or violence or any of that and
 

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:52.320
profanity or violence or any of that and
then there's a greater chance of not

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:52.330
then there's a greater chance of not
 

00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:55.829
then there's a greater chance of not
getting to monetize because of that that

00:12:55.829 --> 00:12:55.839
getting to monetize because of that that
 

00:12:55.839 --> 00:12:58.320
getting to monetize because of that that
means I can no longer bulk monetize my

00:12:58.320 --> 00:12:58.330
means I can no longer bulk monetize my
 

00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:03.690
means I can no longer bulk monetize my
videos so when defi finally unlinked
