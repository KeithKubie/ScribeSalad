00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Before I explain, let me ask a second related quiz.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Is it possible that 50%, 90% or even 99% of all the people in the world

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
are smarter than the average person.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000
You now check any or all of those or none of those, so you have four choices.

00:00:28.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Check any or all but at least one of those.
