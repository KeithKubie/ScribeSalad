00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:07.620
Compute twenty-five hundred
times 80, or 2,500 times 80.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.160
Now, we could just do this
multiplication problem like a

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.725
traditional one, but when you
have these numbers with a lot

00:00:12.725 --> 00:00:15.340
of zeroes there, and it actually
sometimes helps you

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.010
do it in your head, is
to kind of think

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.260
about the zeroes later.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.120
And the reason why we can do
that-- let's rewrite this

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:21.580
multiplication problem.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.920
2,500 times 80.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.020
This is equivalent to--
2,500 is what?

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:30.760
It's 25 times 100.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.680
This is equivalent
to 25 times 100.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.680
That's what 2,500 is.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.320
2,500 is 25 times
100 times 80.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.760
And what's 80?

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.260
80 is 8 times 10.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.990
And in multiplication, you can
rearrange it any way you like.

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:53.250
You can change the order when
it's all a bunch of numbers

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.290
being multiplied.

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:59.440
So this is the same thing, this
is the equivalent to 25

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:10.610
times 8 times 100 times 10.

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.130
And in the future, you're going
to be able to do this in

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.950
your head, but I really want
to show you why you can do

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.010
this in your head, why you can
just multiply 25 times 8, and

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:20.920
then worry about the zeroes.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.570
So what's this going
to be equal to?

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:28.210
So this is going to be
equal to 25 times 8.

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.860
And what's 100 times 10?

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:31.890
Well, 100 times 10 is 1,000.

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.680
You can maybe do that
in your head.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.950
And whenever you multiply powers
of ten, the way you can

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:40.720
think about it is you just
literally add the zeroes.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.290
You had two zeroes here.

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:43.490
You have one zero here.

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.040
When you take their product,
you're going to get something

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.970
with three zeroes.

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.180
100 times 10 is 1,000.

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.870
And when we multiply this times
whatever this is, we'll

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.430
literally just add three zeroes
to the product, so

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:56.960
that's why this is useful.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.490
We can now think about this as
being-- this is the same thing

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:06.540
as 25 times 8, and then whatever
25 times 8 is, we can

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:12.460
then add three zeroes to it.

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.780
Hopefully, this explained
a little bit about why.

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.050
Let's figure out what
25 times 8 is.

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.870
25 times 8.

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.210
5 times 8 is 40.

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:27.150
Put the zero down.

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.400
Carry the 4.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.150
8 times 2 is 16 plus 4 is 20.

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.380
So it's an even 200,
which makes sense.

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.630
4 times 24 is 100, or four
quarters make a $1.00, so

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.080
eight quarters would
make $2.00, so

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.150
that all makes sense.

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.440
So this part right here is
200, so we're going to

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.650
multiply 200 times 1,000.

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.980
The easiest way to think about
it is you just add the zeroes

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.300
when you're multiplying
times a power of ten.

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.580
So this is going to be-- we're
going to have a 200, or you

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.510
could just imagine you have 2,
0, 0, and then you add the

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.280
three zeroes there.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.550
One, two, three, and you
are left with 200,000.

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.450
So 2,500 times 80: 200,000.

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.400
You could've multiplied it out
in the traditional sense, but

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.430
it's good to see this-- I guess
you could call it a

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.490
trick or a way to do it in
your head a little bit.

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:21.930
And you'll see that more
and more, the more

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.710
practice you get.
