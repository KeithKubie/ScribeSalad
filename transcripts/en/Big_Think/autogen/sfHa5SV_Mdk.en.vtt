believe that science has made belief in
 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.560

that certain ways of interpreting

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440
that certain ways of interpreting
 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.770
that certain ways of interpreting
certain scriptures have been made

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:43.780
certain scriptures have been made
 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.220
certain scriptures have been made
obsolete by science but that in no way

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230
obsolete by science but that in no way
 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.049
obsolete by science but that in no way
makes religious faith or belief in God

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:49.059
makes religious faith or belief in God
 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:52.259
makes religious faith or belief in God
obsolete it just requires what I would

consider to be a different outlook a

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.210
consider to be a different outlook a
 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.319
consider to be a different outlook a
maturation of religious faith but if we

00:00:58.319 --> 00:00:58.329
maturation of religious faith but if we
 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:00.090
maturation of religious faith but if we
look at the history of religious faith

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100
look at the history of religious faith
 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.049
look at the history of religious faith
as told in the scriptures and as seen

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059
as told in the scriptures and as seen
 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.850
as told in the scriptures and as seen
throughout history I think the entire

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860
throughout history I think the entire
 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.270
throughout history I think the entire
history of faith has been one of a

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280
history of faith has been one of a
 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.630
history of faith has been one of a
maturation of that faith I see it not so

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640
maturation of that faith I see it not so
 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.020
maturation of that faith I see it not so
much as people becoming more mature in

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030
much as people becoming more mature in
 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.899
much as people becoming more mature in
their faith but God challenging people

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:18.909
their faith but God challenging people
 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:22.859
their faith but God challenging people
to become more mature to get a clearer

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:22.869
to become more mature to get a clearer
 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:25.789
to become more mature to get a clearer
understanding of what God wants for

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799
understanding of what God wants for
 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.219
understanding of what God wants for
humankind and I think God is always

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229
humankind and I think God is always
 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:35.429
humankind and I think God is always
pushing us to be better than what we are

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:35.439
 

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:37.469
okay so there's two ways of answering

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:37.479
okay so there's two ways of answering
 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:41.340
okay so there's two ways of answering
that question by and large science and

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350
that question by and large science and
 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.789
that question by and large science and
religion deal with different kinds of

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:44.799
religion deal with different kinds of
 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:47.580
religion deal with different kinds of
questions science deals with questions

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590
questions science deals with questions
 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.289
questions science deals with questions
about how do things come to be the way

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:49.299
about how do things come to be the way
 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:51.929
about how do things come to be the way
they are how should I think about the

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:51.939
they are how should I think about the
 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:54.539
they are how should I think about the
way things are how shall I organize my

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:54.549
way things are how shall I organize my
 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:56.669
way things are how shall I organize my
understanding of the way things behave

00:01:56.669 --> 00:01:56.679
understanding of the way things behave
 

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:59.699
understanding of the way things behave
whereas religion deals with questions

00:01:59.699 --> 00:01:59.709
whereas religion deals with questions
 

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:03.719
whereas religion deals with questions
like how should I behave toward my

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729
like how should I behave toward my
 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:06.690
like how should I behave toward my
fellow human creatures what should my

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700
fellow human creatures what should my
 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.210
fellow human creatures what should my
relationship be to God how should I

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220
relationship be to God how should I
 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.199
relationship be to God how should I
understand the ultimate origins of this

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209
understand the ultimate origins of this
 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:15.420
understand the ultimate origins of this
world in this universe in which we live

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430
world in this universe in which we live
 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.039
world in this universe in which we live
these are very different kinds of

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:17.049
these are very different kinds of
 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:20.550
these are very different kinds of
questions but sometimes the areas that

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560
questions but sometimes the areas that
 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.880
questions but sometimes the areas that
science addresses and the areas that

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890
science addresses and the areas that
 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.860
science addresses and the areas that
religion addresses can overlap so I

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870
religion addresses can overlap so I
 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:31.140
religion addresses can overlap so I
don't ascribe to the idea of science and

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150
don't ascribe to the idea of science and
 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.490
don't ascribe to the idea of science and
religion as being non-overlapping

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500
religion as being non-overlapping
 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.250
religion as being non-overlapping
magisteria as they've sometimes been

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260
magisteria as they've sometimes been
 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.780
magisteria as they've sometimes been
described but I also will say that by

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790
described but I also will say that by
 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.330
described but I also will say that by
and large they deal with different kinds

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340
and large they deal with different kinds
 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.150
and large they deal with different kinds
of questions but there are ethical

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160
of questions but there are ethical
 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.069
of questions but there are ethical
questions that might involve things like

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:47.079
questions that might involve things like
 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:49.500
questions that might involve things like
medical ethics or environmental

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510
medical ethics or environmental
 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.020
medical ethics or environmental
questions where you have to understand

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030
questions where you have to understand
 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.360
questions where you have to understand
the science in order to be able to make

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370
the science in order to be able to make
 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.030
the science in order to be able to make
good ethical decisions that are guided

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040
good ethical decisions that are guided
 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.890
good ethical decisions that are guided
by your religious principles so there's

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900
by your religious principles so there's
 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.930
by your religious principles so there's
always going to be places where science

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940
always going to be places where science
 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.970
always going to be places where science
and religion are going to come to bear

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980
and religion are going to come to bear
 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.200
and religion are going to come to bear
on the same kinds of problems
