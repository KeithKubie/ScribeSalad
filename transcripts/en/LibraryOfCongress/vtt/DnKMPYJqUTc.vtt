00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:06.220
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:07.520
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: [Applause]
Thank you all.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.070
It's so wonderful to be
here for this festival.

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:12.830
It's such a shot in
the arm every year.

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:14.890
We will not have time
for questions today.

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:19.560
Our author needs to sprint
away to a wedding, not her own.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.820
Yes, I asked.

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.760
A brilliant debut novel like
"Homegoing" can be deceptive.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.210
I mean, it seems to come
out of nowhere, doesn't it?

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.230
I mean, how can such
talent just spring

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.750
up suddenly and dazzle us all?

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.730
And then she's on the Late
Show with Seth Myers, you know.

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.800
You're like, who is this
person, where did they come from?

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.070
But of course, that version of
the author's success usually skims

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.910 position:56%
over years of hard work and the
remarkable story of a writer's life.

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.230
Yaa Gyasi was born in Ghana
and came to the United States

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.060
when she was two, and her family
eventually settled in Alabama.

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.810
She holds a BA in English
from Stanford and an MFA

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.340
from the Iowa Writers Workshop,
and I think she was one

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.670
of Marilyn Robinson's students.

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.840
[applause] This does
not surprise me.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.750
Her work on "Homegoing"
took seven years.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.820
She's only 27 years old.

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.700
And it was not a sudden or
straightforward road to success.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.280
The idea of the novel first came
to her as a college sophomore

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.450
when she visited Ghana and
toured the Cape Coast Castle,

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.200
this old fort where slaves were
once held before being shipped out.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.230
Eventually she conceded this vast
and complex story about slavery

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.600
and racism that begins in the
18th century with two half-sisters

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.420
who don't know each other.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.750
They are, as she writes, like
a woman and her reflection,

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.750
doomed to stay on opposite
sides of the pond.

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.370
From there the novel
stretches out over 300 years,

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.050
following the descendants in
Africa and the United States.

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.110
Chapter by chapter, the book
moves back and forth between them

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.430 position:56%
and the respective contents, jumping
ahead a generation each time,

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.610
until she finally arrives
where we are today,

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.570
in an era still struggling
to create a society

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.620
in which all people are treated
equally and with respect.

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:09.180
It's just a devastating story that
manages to capture the degradations

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:12.890
of slavery among the
enslaved and the enslavers.

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.570
It asks us to consider the tangled
chains of moral responsibility

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.360
that hang on our history.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.760
During the last chapter,
it's up to the 20th century.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.620
A teacher in Ghana tells the
students, we believe the one

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.420
who has the power, he is the
one who gets to write the story.

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.900
So when you study history,
you must always ask yourself,

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.200
whose story am I my missing?

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.250
Whose voice was suppressed so
that this voice could come forth?

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.170
Yaa Gyasi has found several
of those suppressed people

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.450
and given them a voice
that is truly captivating.

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.510
Please welcome her to the stage.

00:02:45.510 --> 00:03:00.070
[ Applause ]

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.890
&gt;&gt; Yaa Gyasi: Thank you so much,
Ron, for that introduction,

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.910
and thank you all for coming today.

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.510
As Ron mentioned, I'm sorry
we only have a short amount

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:09.810
of time together.

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.720
I have to run off because
I'm Maid of Honor

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.190
in my best friend's wedding.

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.350
So we won't have time
for a Q&amp;A I'm afraid.

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:22.870
I want to begin this
talk with a story.

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.610
James Powell was 15 years old.

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.200
He was playing with his
friends in front of a building

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.390
in a predominantly
white neighborhood,

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:31.690
when the superintendent

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:35.860
of the building started spraying
the boys with a water hose.

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:41.730
Annoyed, perhaps angry, Powell
started chasing after the super.

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.700
A police officer by the name

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.540
of Thomas Gilligan
responded to the scene.

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.150 position:56%
Moments later, Powell was shot dead.

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.460
Did he have a knife?

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:54.090
Did he not have a knife?

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.020
Every account seems to differ.

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:03.040
Two days later, what we now refer
to as the Harlem riots of 1964,

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:09.020
broke out, causing damage and
destruction and numerous arrests.

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.460
These riots come up in
my novel "Homegoing."

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:16.940
A character named Sonny is thinking
about the damage while walking

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.620
to his mother's house in Harlem.

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.350
He's fearful.

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:22.650
He's worried.

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.340
But also he just needs to get home.

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.640
"Homegoing" is a novel that
follows the family lineage

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.670
of two half-sisters.

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:36.050
The first half-sister, Effia, is
the wife of the British governor

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.760
of the Cape Coast Castle, a
slave fort that still stands

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.440
in the country now known as Ghana.

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.060
Esi, the second sister,
is kept in the castle

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:51.360
as a slave before being
sent to America.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:57.650
The novel travels through 250 years
of Ghanaian and American history.

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:02.180
Each chapter devoted to a new
descendent of Effia and Esi,

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:06.150 position:56%
all the way down to the present day.

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.550
I started writing "Homegoing"
in 2009,

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:13.720
after visiting the Cape Coast
Castle and taking a tour.

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:18.270
On that tour, the guide spoke to
us about how the British soldiers

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:21.450
who lived and worked in
the castle at the time used

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:23.740
to marry the local women.

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.190
From there, he took us
down to see the dungeons.

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:30.310
And I wish I could describe
to you all what it felt

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:33.700
like to stand in those dungeons.

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:38.000
They still smell, even
though centuries have passed,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.590
they're still covered with grime.

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:44.560
The death can't be washed
away from those walls.

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:50.230 position:56%
I knew that day in the castle that I
wanted to write about this history.

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:54.270
But over the course of the seven
years that I worked on this novel,

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:57.330
my project grew and grew.

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:03.480
In part I think because the more I
wrote about and studied the past,

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:07.890
the more concerned I
became with our present.

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:12.510
There is a quote that often
attributed to Mark Twain that goes,

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:17.850
"history doesn't repeat
itself but it rhymes."

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:21.590
Even today, as I stand here,
our country is yet again

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:24.750
in turmoil following the
extrajudicial shootings

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:26.470
of black men.

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:29.400
Governor Pat McCrory of North
Carolina declared a state

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:32.550
of emergency on Wednesday
night, as the uprisings

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:35.570
in Charlotte started to swell.

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:38.010
We've been here before.

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:40.360
This moment rhymes with ones we saw

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:44.370
in Baltimore last April
following Freddie Grey's murder.

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:48.400
And that moment rhymes with ones
we saw in Ferguson two years ago,

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:50.500
following Mike Brown's murder.

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:55.080
And those moments rhyme with the
one I described to you earlier,

00:06:55.080 --> 00:07:01.140
in Harlem, in 1964, more
than half a century ago,

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:02.900
following James Powell's murder.

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:09.130
In 1967, Dr. Martin Luther
King delivered a speech

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:13.100
at Stanford University,
where he said the following.

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:19.060 position:56%
"I think America must see that riots
do not develop out of thin air.

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:23.040
Certain conditions continue
to exist in our society,

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:27.890
which must be condemned as
vigorously as we condemn riots.

00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:33.440
But in the final analysis, a riot
is the language of the unheard.

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:37.680
And what is it that
America has failed to hear?

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:39.620
It has failed to hear
that the plight

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:44.100
of the Negro poor has worsened
over the last few years.

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:47.330
It has failed to hear that
the promises of freedom

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:49.680
and justice have not been met.

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:52.730
And it has failed to
hear that large segments

00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:56.850 position:56%
of white society are more concerned
about tranquility and the status quo

00:07:56.850 --> 00:08:00.560
than about justice,
equality, and humanity.

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:04.930 position:56%
And so in a real sense, our
nation's summers of riots are caused

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:08.040
by our nation's winters of delay.

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:12.160
And as long as America postpones
justice, we stand in the position

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:14.500
of having these recurrences
of violence

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:18.160
and riots over and over again."

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:24.410
This quote was shared widely across
my social media circles this week.

00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:25.760
It's powerful.

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:29.550
Another example not only
of Dr. King's wisdom,

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:32.030
but also of his oppressions.

00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:36.330
You read it and you
think, how did he know?

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:41.230
This quote is often truncated,
ending with a famous quote,

00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:45.450
the famous phrase, "a riot is
the language of the unheard."

00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:50.540
But I am often most struck by the
consequence that Dr. King lays out,

00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:55.110
that as long as America
continues to postpone justice,

00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:58.740
we stand in the position of having
these recurrences of violence

00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:02.000
and riots over and over again.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000
There, again, is that repetition.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.950
The idea of historical recurrence.

00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:10.250
The idea of rhyme.

00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:15.900
There's a character in
my novel named Marcus.

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:18.670
Marcus is Sonny's child.

00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:24.600 position:56%
He's a graduate student at Stanford,
studying for a PhD in sociology.

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:26.930
I admit that Marcus's struggles

00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:32.710
to write his dissertation echo
my struggles to write this novel.

00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:39.560
On page 289 of "Homegoing," Marcus
describes his freckles like this.

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:44.610
Originally he'd wanted to focus his
work on the convict leasing system

00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:49.310
that had stolen 10 years off
of his great grandpa H's life.

00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:54.750
But the deeper into the research
he got, the bigger the project got.

00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:58.170
How could he talk about
great grandpa H's story

00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:01.800
without also talking about his
grandma Willie, and the millions

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:06.980
of other black people who had
migrated north, fleeing Jim Crow?

00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:10.340
And if he mentioned the great
migration, he'd have to talk

00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:13.510
about the cities that
took that flock in.

00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:16.460
He'd have to talk about Harlem.

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:18.330
And how could he talk about Harlem

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:21.710
without mentioning his
father's heroin addiction?

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:23.770
The Stinson prison,
the criminal record.

00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:29.990
And if he was going to talk about
heroin and Harlem and the '60s,

00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:34.870
wouldn't he also have to talk
about crack everywhere in the '80s?

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:36.570
And if he wrote about crack,

00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:41.100
he'd inevitably be writing
too about the war on drugs.

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:44.540
And if he started talking about
the war on drugs, he'd be talking

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:48.040
about how nearly half of the
black men he grew up with were

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:50.050
on their way either into or out

00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:53.950
of what had become the harshest
prison system in the world.

00:10:53.950 --> 00:10:55.640
And if he talked about why friends

00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:59.340
from his hood were doing five-year
bids for possession of marijuana,

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:01.590
when nearly all of the white
people he went to school

00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:05.030
with smoked it every
day, he'd get so angry

00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:09.210
that he'd slam the research book
down on the table of the beautiful

00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:11.640
but deadly silent Lane reading room

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:15.420
of Green Library of
Stanford University.

00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:17.720
And if he slammed the book down,

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:20.110
then everyone in the
room would stare.

00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:25.490
And all they would see would
be his skin and his anger.

00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:28.740
And they'd think that they
knew something about him.

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:30.770
And it would be the same something

00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:34.440
that had justified putting
his great grandpa H in prison,

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:37.880
only it would be different too.

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:41.600
Less obvious than it once was.

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:46.960
Marcus is, again, talking
about moments that rhyme.

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:51.800
Though he lives in Palo Alto in
the 21st century, he understands

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:56.030
that there is a kind of echo,
a kind of reverberation,

00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:59.550
that he thinks began
with his great grandpa H,

00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:03.330
who lived in Alabama
in the 19th century.

00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:07.470
But we know that it didn't
begin with H in Alabama.

00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:12.590
Rather, it began further
back, with Esi, the slave.

00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:16.990
Who in the 18th century, was
stolen from her shanty village,

00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:19.800
taken to the Cape Coast
Castle and shipped

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:23.320
through to the middle
passage through to America,

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:28.020
where she would spend all of the
rest of her living days as a slave.

00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:34.570
One thing that struck me while
writing "Homegoing" that continues

00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:41.530
to strike me as I listen to
the news, is that 100 years is

00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:47.700
but a breath in the march
of time, it is but a breath.

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:53.810 position:56%
My father was born in 1957, the
year that Ghana gained independence.

00:12:53.810 --> 00:12:57.870
Therefore, Ghana, as
we know it today,

00:12:57.870 --> 00:13:01.820
is only ever as old as my father.

00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:06.040
Only a few days ago, Ruby Bridges,
one of the first black children

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:09.480
to desegregate an all
white school in Louisiana,

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:13.450
celebrated her 62nd birthday.

00:13:13.450 --> 00:13:17.770
Maybe you've seen the pictures
of little Ruby Bridges' march

00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:20.550
to her new elementary school.

00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:23.940
Maybe you've seen the crowds
of white people gathered

00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:27.650
to launch racist epithets
at the child, who spit

00:13:27.650 --> 00:13:32.020
and threw rocks at a
six-year-old child.

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:35.890
To imagine that the brave
young woman who withstood all

00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:41.520
of that violent racism is only 62
years old today is an important

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:48.280 position:56%
reminder that our past is not as
distant as we might like to believe.

00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:53.020
Even slavery, that thing that I
have heard people say happened

00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:59.650
like a million years ago, is much
nearer than we'd care to admit.

00:13:59.650 --> 00:14:05.430
America is a young country
in a very old world.

00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:09.290
And a century is but a breath.

00:14:09.290 --> 00:14:13.080
I'd like to end today's
talk by reading a little bit

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:16.550
from the sixth chapter
of "Homegoing."

00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:20.440
This chapter follows
Kojo, called Joe,

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:25.250
the son of Ness, the
grandson of Esi.

00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:29.770
Kojo is a runaway slave, living
in Baltimore with his family,

00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:36.160
when the Fugitive Slave
Act of 1850 is passed.

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:40.280
Within a couple of weeks, word
came in that James Hamlett,

00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:42.670
a Baltimore runaway,
had been kidnapped

00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:45.530
and convicted in New York City.

00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:48.300
The white folks wrote about
it in the New York Herald

00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:50.800
and in the Baltimore Sun.

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:55.300
He was the first, but everyone
knew there would be more.

00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:59.120
People began moving up to
Canada by the hundreds.

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:04.100 position:56%
Joe went to Fells Point one week and
what used to be a sea of black faces

00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:09.870
against the backdrop of the blue
green bay had turned into nothing.

00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:13.680
Matheson had made sure Joe's
whole family had their free

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:16.050
papers together.

00:15:16.050 --> 00:15:20.940
But he knew others with papers
too, and even they had fled.

00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:23.540
Matheson spoke to Joe again.

00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:27.810
I want to make sure you know
what's at stake here, Joe.

00:15:27.810 --> 00:15:30.400
If they catch you,
they'll take you to trial

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:33.130
but you won't get any
kind of say at all.

00:15:33.130 --> 00:15:34.720
It'll be the white man's word

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:38.830
against yours, which
is no word at all.

00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:43.360
You all make sure to carry your
papers at all times, understand?

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:45.120
Joe nodded.

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:48.200
There were rallies and
protests throughout the North,

00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:50.900
and not just among the Negroes.

00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:54.370
White people were joining in
like Joe had never seen them join

00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:56.770
in about anything before.

00:15:56.770 --> 00:16:00.960
The South had brought the spite to
the Northern welcome mat when many

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:04.030
of them had wanted
nothing to do with it.

00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:08.770
Now white people could be fined
for giving a Negro a meal or a job

00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:13.970
or a place to stay, if the law
said that Negro was a runaway.

00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:18.040
And how were they to know who
was a runaway and who wasn't?

00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:20.820
It had created an impossible
situation.

00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:22.750
And those who had been
determined to stay

00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:27.960
on the fence found themselves
without a fence at all.

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:31.570
In the mornings, before Joe
and Anna went off to work,

00:16:31.570 --> 00:16:35.080
Joe made the children
practice showing their papers.

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:37.160
He would play the federal marshal.

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:41.750
Hands on his hips, walking up to
each of them, even little Gracie,

00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:47.220
and saying in a voice as stern as
he could muster, where you going?

00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:49.710
And they would reach into
the pockets Anna had sewn

00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:53.820
into their dresses and pants,
and without any backtalk,

00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:59.500
always silently, thrusts
those papers into Joe's hands.

00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:02.770
When he'd first started doing
this, the children would burst

00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:06.150
into laughter, thinking
it was a game.

00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:09.590
They didn't know about Joe's
fear of people in uniform,

00:17:09.590 --> 00:17:14.090
didn't know what it was like to
lie silent and barely breathing

00:17:14.090 --> 00:17:18.500
under the floorboards of a Quaker
house, listening to the sounds

00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:22.280
of a catcher's boot
heel stomp above you.

00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:26.440
Joe had worked hard so that
his children wouldn't have

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:28.690
to inherit his fear.

00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:33.210
But now he wished they had
just the tiniest morsel of it.

00:17:33.210 --> 00:17:36.070
You worry too much, Anna said.

00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:37.640
Ain't nobody looking for them kids.

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:40.460 position:56%
Ain't nobody looking for us neither.

00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:42.980
The baby was due any day now.

00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:47.250
And Joe had noticed that his wife
had become crankier than ever,

00:17:47.250 --> 00:17:50.400
snapping at him for
the tiniest of things.

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:52.970
She craved fish and lemons.

00:17:52.970 --> 00:17:55.410
She walked with her
hands on her lower back.

00:17:55.410 --> 00:17:57.300
And she forgot things.

00:17:57.300 --> 00:17:58.600
The keys one day.

00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:00.790
The broom the next.

00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:04.090
Joe worried she would
forget her papers next.

00:18:04.090 --> 00:18:07.400
He'd seen her leave them
rumpled and worn on her side

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:09.960
of the mattress one day
when she went to the market.

00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:12.940
And he'd yelled at her for it.

00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:15.720
He'd yelled at her until she cried.

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:21.230
Bad as he felt that day, he knew
she would never forget again.

00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:24.510 position:56%
Thank you all so much for listening.
