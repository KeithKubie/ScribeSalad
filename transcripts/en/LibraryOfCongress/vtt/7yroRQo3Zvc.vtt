00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.540
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Loar: All
right, hello, everybody,

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:21.290
welcome to today's lecture.

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:24.470
I want to thank everyone
for coming out.

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:26.130
My name is Jonathan Loar,

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.500
and I'm the South Asian
reference librarian here

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.180
in the Asian Division of
the Library of Congress.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.740
And I just wanted to thank
everybody for coming out.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.450
What we have is a fantastic
lecture today, "The Sikh Legacy

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.260
in Pakistan", by
author Amardeep Singh.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.470
Today's talk is presented by the
Asian Division of the Library

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.160
of Congress, and the
National Sikh Campaign.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.850
At the outset I'd like
to first extend my thanks

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.430
to Dr. Rajwant Singh of
the National Sikh Campaign,

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.190
for putting me in touch with
Amardeep, and for also helping

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.070
to promote today's event.

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.570
Please be advised that today's
program will be recorded,

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.300
and later released as a webcast.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.510
So please turn off or
silence your mobile phones

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:06.920
and other devices.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.850
Also, please be advised that any
questions you may ask at the end

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.940
of the program will be
recorded, and that the act

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.980
of asking the question
constitutes permission for us

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.580
to record and broadcast
later as a webcast.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.800
As a reminder, there
will be time

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.490
for questions after the talk.

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.200
And we ask that you ask,
you know, short questions

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.660
about topics relevant
to the presentation,

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.770
as opposed to extended comments.

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.010
Before we get started, I'd
like to invite Dr. Qi Qiu,

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.730
the Asian Division's head
of Scholarly Services just

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:42.650
to say a few words
about the Asian Division

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:44.680
and the Asian Reading Room
at the Library of Congress.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.980
Dr. Qiu.

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.180
&gt;&gt; Dr. Qi Qiu: Thank
you, Jonathan.

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.010
On behalf of the Asian Division,

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.720
welcome to this afternoon's
event.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.200
So if you are familiar with
the Library of Congress

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.710
or its Asian collections, you
probably will know that here

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:14.250
at the Library, the Asian
Division operat, both physical

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.430
and digital collections
in Asian languages,

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.730
and get research assistance
from our subject specialists.

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:28.230
The Asian Division was formerly
founded in 1928 as the Division

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.400
of Chinese Literature.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.740
So this year actually
marks the 90th anniversary

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.430
of the Asian Division.

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.810
Even though it was named the
"Division of Chinese Literature"

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.640
when it was founded, it
started collecting Chinese

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.600
and Japanese materials,
and received Mongolian

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:52.020
and Tibetan materials as gifts
in the late 19th century.

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.600
So from the earliest,
the gift of presentation

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.760
to the United States by
the emperor of China,

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.820
the collections of the
Asian Division have grown

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:05.090
to represent one of the most
comprehensive collections

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.460
of the Asian languages
in the world.

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:12.300
That is more than four
million physical items.

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.210
So these items are in
more than 130 languages,

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:21.620
and include most subject fields,
covering in the area ranging

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.180
from the South Asian
subcontinent,

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.050
to Southeast Asia, to East Asia.

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:29.570
So in the next few minutes,

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:32.250
Dr. Loar will give a more
detailed introduction

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.190
of our South Asian collections.

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.150
So users can access
our collections

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.070
at the Asian Reading
Room, which is located

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:45.680
in the Thomas Jefferson Building
across the Independence Avenue

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.030
on the fourth floor, room 150.

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:55.330
So our reading room opens Monday
to Friday from 8:30 to 5:00 p.m.

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:59.030
So anyone who is 16
years or older can come

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.660
to use the Library
reading rooms.

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.580
All you need to do
is bring a photo ID

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.280
and get a reader
registration card.

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:13.050
The registration card location
is also on the first floor

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:14.800
of the Jefferson Building.

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.940
And of course, it's
always a good idea

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.640
to consult Library catalog

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:22.610
and Asian Reading Room website
before you come to the Library

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.730
so that you can identify
the materials

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:27.190
that you will be looking
at, and make better use

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.290
of your time at the Library.

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:33.270
So in addition to general books,
we also have special collections

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:38.060
and rare books in many Asian
languages, and users need

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.460
to make appointments
with our librarians

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.320
to use the rare items.

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:47.600
And you can request
appointments, request materials,

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.480
and send research questions on
the Asian Reading Room website

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.340
at the link marked "ask
librarian" [phonetic].

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.590
So "ask a librarian"
is an important phrase

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:58.720
for you to remember.

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.410
And also, we subscribe to
many electronic resources

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:05.940
in Asian studies, and users
can access them anywhere

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:09.330
in the Library's campus.

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.610
All this information
will be included

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:14.400
in the brochure available here.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.100
And we hope that it will not be
your last trip to the Library

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.380
of Congress, and we
hope to see you again

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:22.780
in our reading room
at the Library.

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.510
Thank you.

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:28.510
[Applause]

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:35.220
[ Background Sounds ]

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:36.720
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Loar:
Thank you, Dr. Qiu.

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.600
And in similar fashion, I'd
like to give you the briefest

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.230
of brief overviews of the
South Asian collection

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:44.370
that we have here at
the Library of Congress.

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:47.660
The South Asian collection,
of course, contains materials

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:54.410
from Ba, and over 68,000
titles on microphage.

00:05:54.410 --> 00:06:01.220
We have substantial holdings in
many languages, including Hindi,

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:07.720
Urdu, Bengali, Tamil, Gugurati
[phonetic], Punjabi, Telagus,

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:12.250
Indian, Nepali, Rajistani
[phonetic], and many more.

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:18.280
For example, we have about
13,000 books on Punjabi alone.

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:22.050
Much of the acquisition comes
from our two overseas offices,

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:25.770
one in New Delhi, established
in 1962, and the other

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:29.220
in Islamabad, established
in 1965.

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:31.710
Overall, the South Asian
collection provides broad

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:35.070
research coverage in most
fields and disciplines,

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:38.720
especially vernacular languages
and literature, religion,

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:42.180
philosophy, politics,
history, and sociology.

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:44.320
The collection is also
very strong with regard

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:45.620
to newspapers, journals,

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:48.640
and government publications
from South Asia.

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:51.280
All of these materials -- and
you'll see some examples here

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:54.310
in the slide behind me, all
of these materials are just

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:57.340
like today's lecture, free
and open to the public.

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:59.130
To request materials
from our collections,

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:01.730
all you need is your
reader registration card.

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:03.870
But in the meantime, you
can browse our collections

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:08.240
with the online catalog
at catalog.loc.gov

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:10.840
and you can even limit your
search by langBuilding,

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:19.200
room 150, where you can
access all of our materials

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:22.130
in these South Asian languages.

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:28.520
You can learn more about
the South Asian collection

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:30.810
on the website of the
Asian Reading Room,

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:32.890
and we also invite you
to check out the Library

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:35.480
of Congress Four Corners
of the World blog,

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:38.470
and International
Collections Facebook page,

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:41.140
both of which contain
information on special items

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:44.580
in our collections, as well
as info on upcoming events

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:47.810
and lectures, like
today's lecture.

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:50.390
Now I'd like to invite
Dr. Rajwant Singh

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:53.250
to say a few words, and to
introduce today's speaker.

00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:56.280
Dr. Singh is cofounder of
the National Sikh Campaign,

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:58.730
president of Eco
Sikh, and secretary

00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:01.040
of the Guru Gobind Singh
Foundation in Rockville,

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:03.080
Maryland, to name only a few

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:05.420
of the organizations
in which he serves.

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:08.510
Please welcome Dr.
Rajwant Singh.

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:14.510
[ Applause ]

00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:19.070
[ Background Sounds ]

00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:24.040
&gt;&gt; Dr. Rajwant Singh: Thank you,
Jonathan, for this warm welcome.

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:28.950
And we are extremely thrilled
and excited to be here,

00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:34.420
and are trying to
take the advantage

00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:38.360
of Amardeep's being
here and enlightening us

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:42.160
about this wonderful and
very valuable treasure

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:46.560
that our community has, but
still not yet discovered.

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:53.450
So we are very much thankful
to the Library of Congress here

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:55.700
and the Asian Division.

00:08:55.700 --> 00:09:00.530
And I had no knowledge that
you have four million books

00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:05.100
on ancient languages, and
130 different languages

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:08.310
from the Asian region.

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:12.660
And this is something which we
will want our kids and children

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:14.980
of our community
to be exposed to,

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:18.020
and hopefully will develop
some working relationship

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:20.250
with the Asian Division here.

00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:22.480
And we are also very
delighted to hear

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:25.840
that there's 30,000
Punjabi books,

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:28.030
which is an amazing collection

00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:30.670
that we should be
taking advantage of.

00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:35.960
And so as we are moving
towards the 550th anniversary

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:37.700
of the birth of Gurnanik
[phonetic] next year,

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:43.520
hopefully we'll be planning some
events with the Asian Division,

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:46.050
hopefully in the next year.

00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:50.280
And so I want to thank, once
again, Jonathan for working hard

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:52.330
and really putting
this thing together.

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:57.800
And hopefully, we will
continue this relationship.

00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:02.310
And I want to thank the chief
of the Asian Division, Dr. Shao,

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:06.890
for being here and, you know,
opening the doors of the Library

00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:09.460
for our community,
and for this lecture.

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:19.470
And Amardeep has really done
an amazing job of exposing all

00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:23.120
of us to something
that we had no idea.

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:27.420
And in his lecture, he will
definitely give us a glimpse

00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:35.730
of the immense treasure that the
community has left in Pakistan

00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:39.600
over 70 years, and really
focused on restoring some

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:45.090
of the most important religious
shrines, but for Amardeep

00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:50.000
to really open up -- open
our eyes to the legacy

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.860
of the Sikh empire
[inaudible] and all the warriors

00:10:54.860 --> 00:11:01.710
and the wonderful relationships
that these warriors,

00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:07.830
and these kings, and the
administrators had built

00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:11.130
with the local population
in Pakistan

00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:13.400
and the northwest front.

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:18.590
So that is -- really has excited
the community throughout the

00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:20.830
world, and especially
the Washington area.

00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:23.780
We have had two opportunities
for him to speak

00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:27.340
at different [inaudible], and
there are a lot of young people

00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:31.730
who are becoming interested
in knowing more about this.

00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:38.830
And our hope is that from this
phase, we go to the next phase

00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:47.660
of really preserving these
monuments, and this work of art

00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:51.590
and work of history that
we can keep this alive

00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:53.810
for coming generations.

00:11:53.810 --> 00:11:57.310
So Amardeep has -- was born
in Goa Port [phonetic],

00:11:57.310 --> 00:12:03.710
India and has lived in India,
Hong Kong, and Singapore,

00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:06.910
and has been educated
at the Dunes School.

00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:11.980
And he pursued his electronics
engineering at Manipal Institute

00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:15.900
of Technology, and masters
in business administration

00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:18.940
at the University of Chicago.

00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:24.750
And while he was working for
American Express, certainly,

00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:27.960
he developed this
passion, which he has --

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:30.730
you know, he had the
passion in photography,

00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:33.340
but now from the last
three and a half years,

00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:36.900
he has dedicated his
life to really working

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:42.220
on the Sikh legacy in Pakistan.

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:44.500
And he's written these
two wonderful books.

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:50.320
And those of who have not yet
gotten them, we will be able

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:52.360
to acquire them for you.

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:57.440
Please give your name or
contact information to myself.

00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:59.410
We can get them available
to you.

00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:02.530
So we really want to -- on
behalf of the community,

00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:10.420
we want to thank Amardeep for
is wonderful wife is with us.

00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:14.000
Would you please stand
up and be recognized?

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.520
Please welcome her.

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:21.180
[Applause] Amardeep would not
have accomplished what he has

00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:25.770
done in the last three or
four years without the support

00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:27.070
of his wonderful wife.

00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:29.710
So Amardeep, once
again, thank you so much.

00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:32.150
And on behalf of the
community, we welcome you.

00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:35.720
Please, we are here
to listen to you.

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:38.510
Thank you.

00:13:38.510 --> 00:13:43.510
[ Applause ]

00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:04.520
&gt;&gt; Dr. Amardeep Singh: Thank
you to the Asian Division

00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:08.200
of the Library of Congress, and
to the National Sikh Campaign

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:14.600
for having created this platform
to allow me to share some

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:19.670
of the insights from my two
books, the one which is --

00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:23.250
you're seeing on the screen,
which is the first book

00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:25.030
on your right-hand
side of the screen,

00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:27.940
which is "The Lost Heritage of
the Sikh Legacy in Pakistan,"

00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:31.180
and the second book, which is
called "The Quest Continues:

00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:33.510
Lost Heritage of the
Sikh Legacy in Pakistan".

00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:39.290
Both these books
are a culmination --

00:14:39.290 --> 00:14:45.820
in the short way I can say of a
journey that I started in 2014

00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:49.150
when I stepped into
Pakistan for the first time.

00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:51.720
And it's taken me about
three and a half years

00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:55.550
to document the remnants,
both tangible and intangible,

00:14:55.550 --> 00:15:00.120
across Pakistan in 126
cities and villages.

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:02.710
But actually, in true sense,

00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:05.020
I don't think this
would have been possible

00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:09.560
in such a short span of time had
I not unknowingly been preparing

00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:12.630
myself for the day the divine
would choose me to step

00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:19.530
into the country and himself
start showing me the places

00:15:19.530 --> 00:15:22.790
through a strange energy
that was engulfing me.

00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:26.260
And connecting me to people
which allowed me to kind

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:28.650
of experience what I have
experienced and written

00:15:28.650 --> 00:15:30.140
and chosen to write
in these two books.

00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:33.670
Because I think these books
are going to be a valuable work

00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:37.320
for posterity, because
in seven decades,

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:42.270
we've not had another
publication as I see,

00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:45.340
and that's the reason why I
decided when I went to Pakistan

00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:49.640
that I need to dedicate
my few years of my life

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:53.360
into documenting this what I had
seen, because there are people

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:55.880
who have deep pockets, they
can serve through wealth.

00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:57.830
There are people who
can serve through time.

00:15:57.830 --> 00:15:59.670
And I choose to serve
through my time

00:15:59.670 --> 00:16:02.640
and my own research
that I've done.

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:04.780
So in many ways, the lot of
opportunities that you give

00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:07.190
up when you take up such
works, it's a career

00:16:07.190 --> 00:16:09.890
that I've sacrificed, but
I'm glad that I've done it

00:16:09.890 --> 00:16:11.890
because it's a part that has
not been credited [phonetic]

00:16:11.890 --> 00:16:14.360
on by anyone for seven decades.

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:21.040
And a lot of people ask me how
challenging this work has been,

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:23.550
and I want to start with
that itself, that, you know,

00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:25.000
challenges are abound.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.130
Multitudes of challenges
have come on my way.

00:16:27.130 --> 00:16:32.280
But the sense is that works
like these if they were easy,

00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:34.930
then theoretically you
should be having many,

00:16:34.930 --> 00:16:38.050
many more publications like
these available in the market.

00:16:38.050 --> 00:16:40.370
So if you take a monument
like Taj Mahal, I mean,

00:16:40.370 --> 00:16:42.400
there are more than
10,000 books available.

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:43.850
So why is it that
for the Sikh legacy

00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:45.950
in Pakistan there are
no more books available?

00:16:45.950 --> 00:16:47.930
And therein lies the
answer to the question

00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:49.420
as to how challenging it is.

00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:51.490
It is not a bed of roses,

00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:55.830
but yet some strange energy
has created the path for me.

00:16:55.830 --> 00:16:58.800
And for this, I want to
thank the people of Pakistan,

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:00.880
because they embraced me.

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:05.650
I was simply a man with
a passionate desire

00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:10.140
to understand something
about our past, our roots.

00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:12.820
But if they wouldn't have
embraced me, unknown people,

00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:14.770
the work would not
have happened.

00:17:14.770 --> 00:17:17.030
I also want to thank
the Pakistan government.

00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:19.970
We were hoping someone from the
embassy would have been here

00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:22.440
today, but unfortunately
they are not here.

00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:25.130
But I take it a point
to actually thank them

00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:28.870
because it's my forefathers
who left their heritage

00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:31.970
and the lands where they had
churned [phonetic] it for years

00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:34.810
and centuries and they've
left it in their custody.

00:17:34.810 --> 00:17:36.660
I think the Pakistan government

00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:39.440
from the unfortunate
circumstances that developed

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:42.190
in 1947 where the two
nations got divided based

00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:46.690
on religious tug-of-war,
a civil war that happened,

00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:49.500
and communities got
uprooted from both sides.

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:52.720
Ten million people moved in
1947; one million people died.

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:56.880
But yet in seven decades,

00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:01.930
I think the government has
started embracing these various

00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:03.630
footprints that are there.

00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:08.420
The heritage is too large
to be embraced in totality.

00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:09.900
Much of it is lost.

00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:14.710
But even an effort that embraces
a small magnitude of it,

00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:16.650
I think it's a step in
the right direction.

00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:19.660
It's a change which can
take a different form

00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:20.960
through publications like these

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:22.980
as we create awareness
around the world.

00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:25.140
Hopefully, a bigger
change can happen.

00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:26.830
But I want to thank
the Pakistan government

00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:29.000
for whatever they have embraced.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.790
It's small, but it's
a good start.

00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:34.910
I want to thank them also
for having embraced me

00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:37.960
and my pursuit for the
creation of the second book,

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:40.200
because the areas that I've
gone in the second publication,

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:42.820
the quest continues
[inaudible] in Pakistan.

00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:45.630
I see very, very remote areas,
and some of the [inaudible]

00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:49.590
and the areas in the Pakistan
army controlled areas would not

00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:51.410
have been actually ever possible

00:18:51.410 --> 00:18:54.220
to experience had they not
embraced me and open the gates.

00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:57.040
So for that, I want
to thank them also.

00:18:57.040 --> 00:19:00.640
Now, before I start, I just want
to actually put down a few --

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:04.420
I want to show you
a small video here.

00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:08.270
Sorry; a small video
here of me on the field,

00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:10.510
and then I'll get down to the --

00:19:10.510 --> 00:19:16.510
[ Music ]

00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:32.510
[ Music and Foreign Language ]

00:19:32.510 --> 00:20:11.730
[ Music ]

00:20:11.730 --> 00:20:16.670
So why I'm showing this video is
researching across the country

00:20:16.670 --> 00:20:19.160
where there is really
no chartered path,

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:20.950
and you don't know where
these monuments are lying.

00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:23.220
For seven decades,
they've been abandoned.

00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:25.500
We have history telling us
some of the forts and some

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:26.820
of the bigger structures,

00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:28.820
but really to go
inside the interiors --

00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:31.020
for instance, this is an
unidentified monument.

00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:33.040
I have documented it in my book

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:35.920
because the beautiful
frescoes inside it --

00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:37.990
and its state where
it is standing today,

00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:41.740
about to fall apart, can
raise a lot of emotion,

00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:44.810
and the frescoes convey
a lot of valuable message

00:20:44.810 --> 00:20:46.820
as to how our forefathers
were living.

00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:48.610
I thought it is important
to document.

00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:49.910
But these are the unknown,

00:20:49.910 --> 00:20:52.900
unrecognized monuments
wiped out from the history.

00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:55.910
I don't even know who
made it, why it was made.

00:20:55.910 --> 00:20:57.980
Is there a history
associated with it?

00:20:57.980 --> 00:20:59.280
I have no idea.

00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:01.900
And that man who was walking
with me right in the beginning,

00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:06.400
he basically is that unknown --
I mean, the unknown Pakistani

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:09.590
who became a very good friend of
mine like that that had been 40,

00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:12.590
50 people who have embraced
me, and walked in the fields,

00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:15.890
in the forests, in the
high hills, and the plains

00:21:15.890 --> 00:21:18.160
of Pakistan to make
my work happen.

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:20.160
So that's what I want to
actually convey out of that.

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:25.340
Works like this can be seen
from any community's lens.

00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:27.530
Because when a turmoil happens,

00:21:27.530 --> 00:21:30.170
turmoil does not impact
one community alone,

00:21:30.170 --> 00:21:32.250
and therefore we need to
start by the recognition

00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:36.860
that not just the Sikhs,
but all communities suffered

00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:42.190
in the violence that -- up
to the civil war that erupted

00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:45.010
across the subcontinent in 1947.

00:21:45.010 --> 00:21:47.440
If I was to turn this lens
and choose to do this work

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:51.790
out of Muslim legacy,
the story is the same.

00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:53.620
If I was to do it from a
Hindu or [inaudible] legacy,

00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:54.920
the story is the same.

00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:57.100
And therefore, I say in this
slide is Hindu, Muslims, Sikhs,

00:21:57.100 --> 00:22:01.370
Christians, Parsis,
Jains, Buddhists,

00:22:01.370 --> 00:22:04.060
and I would say even
the Atheists suffered.

00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:08.710
Because I don't know what is
the belief system of a man

00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:11.640
who projects himself to be
a believer of certain faith.

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:14.250
You don't know inside his heart
whether he really believes

00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:15.840
in the existence of God or no.

00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:20.510
And yet, the nation was
divided on belief systems of God

00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:24.640
in the form of religion, and
which resulted in the hypothesis

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:26.290
that -- it's a big hypothesis

00:22:26.290 --> 00:22:29.750
that under the two-nation
theory,

00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:32.220
two communities cannot
live together.

00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:34.910
The Hindus and the Muslims
cannot live together

00:22:34.910 --> 00:22:37.510
as British were leading
the subcontinent.

00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:42.620
The assumption was the
two communities cannot

00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:43.920
exist together.

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:46.740
From a Sikh perspective,
I have started believing

00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:49.780
that the Sikh community was a
mere cucumber in the sandwich.

00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:54.590
The third community which
was not even thought of,

00:22:54.590 --> 00:22:59.080
and which in this two-nation
theory which emerged,

00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:02.710
it was not even put into the
mix until the last moment,

00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:06.200
in the last few one or two
years it came into the mix.

00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:08.980
And it's -- history had churned,

00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:11.340
primarily in the lands
that became Pakistan.

00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:15.640
And this painful saga of all
communities, which were divided

00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:19.080
in 1947 as British left
the Indian subcontinent,

00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:23.340
is described well in
the two-line poetry

00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:28.370
of Shah Daman [phonetic], who
says, "[Foreign language]."

00:23:28.370 --> 00:23:33.850
Basically, what is means
is that, "The red eyes,

00:23:33.850 --> 00:23:39.780
the bloodshot red eyes said
all that both you and we wept."

00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:42.280
So we need to start from this
baseline of understanding

00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:46.450
as I get into specific subject
of the Sikh legacy in Pakistan.

00:23:46.450 --> 00:23:49.200
Now, what I want to
put as a context,

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:50.930
here as Dr. Rajwant just said,

00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:54.040
that the Sikh community's
attention has primarily been

00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:57.160
focused on just religious
aspects across Pakistan;

00:23:57.160 --> 00:24:00.420
not just the Sikh community,
the entire world believes

00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:02.260
that the Sikh community's
entire existence

00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:03.610
across Pakistan seven decades

00:24:03.610 --> 00:24:05.440
after Partition is basically
the few good [inaudible],

00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:08.180
the Sikh temples of
worship like [inaudible],

00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:13.500
the founder of Sikh was born,
or where some stories attached

00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:17.970
with his life, like [inaudible],
or the fifth guru's place plays

00:24:17.970 --> 00:24:23.150
like your -- the data side,
and a few more Gurdwaras.

00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:28.160
The entire community's
thinking is kind of restricted

00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:31.300
on this domain, not
just the Sikh.

00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:36.970
The Muslims inside
Pakistan also believe

00:24:36.970 --> 00:24:39.040
that this is their heritage,

00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:41.420
which we are maintaining
very properly.

00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:46.560
Now, I must tell you my
experience when I did this book,

00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:49.830
my feeling in giving
the title was, "Yes,

00:24:49.830 --> 00:24:51.790
I could have just called it
'The Sikh Legacy in Pakistan',

00:24:51.790 --> 00:24:53.680
but sometimes you need
to shake the system,

00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:54.980
with a positive intent.

00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:59.810
My intent is not here to kind of
finger point and me versus you;

00:24:59.810 --> 00:25:01.110
that's not the intent.

00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:04.380
The intent is to document,
let's accept what's happened,

00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:06.020
let's move forward positively.

00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:07.900
But yet sometimes you
have to give a statement,

00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:10.170
and therefore I chose
the name of this book --

00:25:10.170 --> 00:25:13.320
the title is "The Sikh legacy in
Pakistan", but I chose the name

00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:15.880
of the book as "Lost Heritage".

00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:17.590
And when I use the
word "lost heritage",

00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:20.460
I have taken a long time
to kind of build equity

00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:24.420
with the government in Pakistan
that I don't mean wrong.

00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:26.870
But yet, the first reaction what
I'm telling you is that even

00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:29.210
in Pakistan they
believe that the heritage

00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:32.200
of Sikhs is basically
[inaudible], these three, four,

00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:35.770
five, six Gurdwaras; and we
have been maintaining it fine.

00:25:35.770 --> 00:25:37.780
But writing "Lost
Heritage", the first reaction

00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:41.080
that I remember I got from the
Pakistan government itself was,

00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:43.250
"Why are you calling
it 'Lost Heritage'?

00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:44.610
We have maintained it."

00:25:44.610 --> 00:25:49.300
And that's where you
then realize that, boy,

00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:50.870
how big a problem it is.

00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:53.060
Because when communities get
locked out from the lands

00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:55.400
where their generations
have churned the history,

00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:58.160
the history just
evaporates; not from the minds

00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:01.110
of the community itself
who churned that history

00:26:01.110 --> 00:26:04.500
in their land, but also the
ones who own the responsibility

00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:06.280
to hold that history
in that land.

00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:09.290
It just evaporates
over a period of time.

00:26:09.290 --> 00:26:11.740
My forefathers were
not so incompetent

00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:13.940
that they only made
four or five Gurdwaras

00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:16.730
that the world knows
Pakistan today as.

00:26:16.730 --> 00:26:19.690
My forefathers were not
so incompetent that we

00:26:19.690 --> 00:26:23.830
as the community, as the
descendant of that generation,

00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:27.240
should be only driven to go to
these three or four Gurdwaras.

00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:30.700
There is so much more than the
offer; we have simply forgotten.

00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:33.350
And therefore, I want to bring
your attention to this slide

00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:37.210
where on the black outline you
see the Indians appointment,

00:26:37.210 --> 00:26:39.500
which was the British
India, as we know,

00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:43.310
in 1947 when they were leaving.

00:26:45.470 --> 00:26:48.870
Having come to Calcutta,
they actually started moving.

00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:50.510
Sorry, allow me a minute;

00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:52.510
I just want to take
my pointer out here.

00:26:52.510 --> 00:27:01.590
[ Background Sounds ]

00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:07.570
So having come into
Calcutta in the 1700s,

00:27:07.570 --> 00:27:11.370
as the British started expanding
with the help of Bengal army,

00:27:11.370 --> 00:27:14.140
the Pulbia [phonetic] soldiers,
the [inaudible] regiments,

00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:15.440
they started expanding.

00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:17.740
They came to the Sutlej
River, and they came to a halt

00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:20.460
out here; because the
last standing kingdom,

00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:23.880
the independent kingdom at that
time, was this yellow kingdom

00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:25.950
which was being ruled by
the Getsing [phonetic],

00:27:25.950 --> 00:27:29.540
and its capital was
Lahore [phonetic].

00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:32.500
Now, the historical texts, and
especially the British texts,

00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:35.940
have written this as
the "Sikh Kingdom".

00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:40.410
The Sikhs record themselves
like the [inaudible],

00:27:40.410 --> 00:27:43.390
the five portion volumes,
five-volume portion with lots

00:27:43.390 --> 00:27:45.630
of day-to-day account
to what was happening

00:27:45.630 --> 00:27:47.550
in the Getsing Kingdom
in Lahore.

00:27:47.550 --> 00:27:48.850
It was a very detailed account,

00:27:48.850 --> 00:27:51.750
which has recently
been translated

00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:53.160
into English by the [inaudible].

00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:55.120
If you read that --
actually, there's no mention

00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:58.640
of Sikh Kingdom or the Sikh raj.

00:27:58.640 --> 00:27:59.940
There's nothing like that.

00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:01.870
It's simply referred
to it as [inaudible].

00:28:01.870 --> 00:28:05.340
The Khalsa is basically
a Puritan concept.

00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:09.160
It's a concept which sees
the world in a Puritan form,

00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:12.200
which actually allows to
embrace all communities.

00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:15.240
It's a very secular
concept, purity, right;

00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:17.760
and that's what this
kingdom was termed as.

00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:19.310
British call it as
a Sikh Kingdom

00:28:19.310 --> 00:28:22.110
because they saw [inaudible],
the man who was ruling

00:28:22.110 --> 00:28:24.730
out of Lahore to be a
man who was a believer

00:28:24.730 --> 00:28:26.730
of the Sikh faith, and
therefore they call it.

00:28:26.730 --> 00:28:30.380
I question that because yes, it
was truly a [inaudible] in terms

00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:32.240
of its purity and mindset,

00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:34.330
because there were
implementing that.

00:28:34.330 --> 00:28:39.140
They had an army, which
comprised of six Hindus,

00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:42.310
Muslims, Punjabis for the
first time in 3,000 years

00:28:42.310 --> 00:28:46.690
after Pouris [phonetic] attacked
-- Alexander attacked Punjab,

00:28:46.690 --> 00:28:49.170
it's the first time
after 3,000 years

00:28:49.170 --> 00:28:51.200
that the Punjabis
themselves rules,

00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:54.050
and a man of the soil
formed the kingdom.

00:28:54.050 --> 00:28:55.440
And yes, prior to that,

00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:57.780
the history goes the
[inaudible] formed the kingdom

00:28:57.780 --> 00:29:00.770
out of Lahore -- had
taken over Lahore.

00:29:00.770 --> 00:29:04.610
But truly a big empire like
that for the first time

00:29:04.610 --> 00:29:06.420
in the history of
Punjab, a man of the soil,

00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:07.760
Ranjetsing [phonetic] formed it.

00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:12.120
And he pulled together people
of all faith, Muslims, Hindus,

00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:14.070
Sikhs, rallied around him.

00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:17.060
In spite the differences of
faith, they came together

00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:20.460
for one cause, and
that was what we call

00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:21.870
as "Punjabieth" [phonetic].

00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:23.210
And today that Punjabieth seems

00:29:23.210 --> 00:29:26.650
to be fragmented,
thanks to 1947.

00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:31.950
His foreign minister signed
a treaty with the British

00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:35.620
that decided that this was
the line on the east side

00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:37.880
of the empire of
the "Sikh Kingdom",

00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:41.730
which the British called, which
the British will not cross.

00:29:41.730 --> 00:29:44.020
He signed the treaty
with Afghanistan,

00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:46.450
which today is known as the
"Duden [phonetic] Line".

00:29:46.450 --> 00:29:49.150
You know what, if history
has to be rewritten,

00:29:49.150 --> 00:29:51.870
the man who really
signed this treaty

00:29:51.870 --> 00:29:54.020
and who should be
given the credit,

00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:56.600
it was Fakid Azizudine
[phonetic],

00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:59.110
[inaudible] foreign minister,
or Ranjit Singh himself,

00:29:59.110 --> 00:30:01.640
because this line was
drawn by them running right

00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:02.940
through the Pashtun territory.

00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:05.830
But the British actually
having recognized --

00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:07.760
felt the need of
recognizing the man

00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:11.510
who led the expedition the first
[inaudible] war, which happened

00:30:11.510 --> 00:30:13.610
in Kabul going through
[inaudible],

00:30:13.610 --> 00:30:15.390
was led by the man
called Duden [phonetic].

00:30:15.390 --> 00:30:17.760
So they called this as the
"Duden Line", in recognition.

00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:20.230
But really this line was
created by Fakid Azizudine,

00:30:20.230 --> 00:30:23.550
the foreign minister
of Ranjit Singh.

00:30:23.550 --> 00:30:25.790
All I want to say is that
this [inaudible] stretched

00:30:25.790 --> 00:30:31.320
from Ladakh, Kashmir,
Baltistan, Kiberidia [phonetic].

00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:32.710
The two nations today
are fighting

00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:35.030
over Kashmir, India
and Pakistan.

00:30:35.030 --> 00:30:36.570
Millions of people are --

00:30:36.570 --> 00:30:38.520
thousands of lives
have been lost

00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:41.360
since 1947 in this tug-of-war.

00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:45.090
But people have -- are not
even aware today the man

00:30:45.090 --> 00:30:48.080
who brought the Ladakh,
Baltistan,

00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:50.030
and Kashmir onto
the map of India

00:30:50.030 --> 00:30:54.060
and Pakistan is Ranjit Singh;
because if not for him,

00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:56.790
Kashmir today would be
a part of Afghanistan,

00:30:56.790 --> 00:30:58.090
because the Iranians
were ruling it

00:30:58.090 --> 00:31:00.850
for 110 years before he
brought it into the [inaudible],

00:31:00.850 --> 00:31:02.830
and then the British
took over the Punjab,

00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:05.020
and therefore it became
a part of British India.

00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:07.110
All I want to say is that it
would take this mighty empire,

00:31:07.110 --> 00:31:09.390
which was the last-standing
empire

00:31:09.390 --> 00:31:12.390
of what became British India,
and you lay it over the Pakistan

00:31:12.390 --> 00:31:15.780
and India, what you
find is the line of --

00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:17.330
the [inaudible] line
runs to here,

00:31:17.330 --> 00:31:18.630
and after that it
becomes the line

00:31:18.630 --> 00:31:20.600
of control dividing Kashmir.

00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:23.580
Eighty percent of that
territory is today in Pakistan;

00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:26.400
and that's the one statement I
want to make out of this slide.

00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:27.720
Eighty percent of
that territory is

00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:30.780
in Pakistan, and
20% is in India.

00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:34.490
And therefore, the question
that I'm asking again,

00:31:34.490 --> 00:31:36.150
"Were my forefathers
so incompetent

00:31:36.150 --> 00:31:38.830
that they only made these
two or three Gurdwaras?"

00:31:38.830 --> 00:31:46.210
Right? And therefore, as I
stood at this grave while going

00:31:46.210 --> 00:31:49.740
up to Montserrat -- I'm
sorry, this grave is

00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:54.450
at Montserrat while going
to Kashmir [inaudible]

00:31:54.450 --> 00:31:58.730
at this graveyard -- on this
grave behind these shrubs

00:31:58.730 --> 00:32:02.100
and the plants out here you
see behind there's a plaque

00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:04.310
out up here on which
is written in Urdu,

00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:08.690
"Ghulam Sarwar vald
Makhan Singh."

00:32:08.690 --> 00:32:12.070
Ghulam Sarwar, a Muslim, who
lives buried here whose father,

00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:14.970
a Sikh, Makhan Singh --

00:32:14.970 --> 00:32:16.870
well whose father was
Makhan Singh, a Sikh.

00:32:16.870 --> 00:32:20.750
Now, I don't need to know
or I don't have any idea

00:32:20.750 --> 00:32:22.380
as to what happened
with Ghulam Sarwar,

00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:25.360
why did he convert his faith
and why is he lying buried here?

00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:27.850
But the point I'm trying to
make out of this grave is

00:32:27.850 --> 00:32:31.050
that legacy is not religion;

00:32:31.050 --> 00:32:34.750
because this grave is
also a part of my legacy.

00:32:34.750 --> 00:32:38.630
A Sikh's son is lying buried
here, and therefore I see this

00:32:38.630 --> 00:32:42.160
as a part of my legacy, and the
story needs to be documented.

00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:47.770
And that part when I saw this
grave is what actually motivated

00:32:47.770 --> 00:32:51.330
me to embark on this journey
to document in the form

00:32:51.330 --> 00:32:53.860
of a publication,
because I did not go

00:32:53.860 --> 00:32:55.660
to Pakistan to write a book.

00:32:55.660 --> 00:32:58.400
I consider myself as
an accidental author.

00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:01.280
I have been in the corporate
world for about 25 years.

00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:04.350
I was the regional head for Asia
Pacific for American Express

00:33:04.350 --> 00:33:05.990
for the revenue management.

00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:08.980
In 2014 for certain
reasons, I left my job

00:33:08.980 --> 00:33:10.660
because I had been
there for 25 years;

00:33:10.660 --> 00:33:11.960
I was looking for
something else.

00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:14.220
But in the six months of
the cooling down period

00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:16.600
that I was actually going
through, I just thought

00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:20.420
that I need to go up to
Kashmir to my father's place,

00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:24.010
because in 1947 when
he was ousted

00:33:24.010 --> 00:33:25.840
because of the Kashmir
problem which started

00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:28.370
after the Partition
of 1947 of Punjab --

00:33:28.370 --> 00:33:30.100
I don't call it as a
Partition of India,

00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:32.600
I call it as a Partition of
Punjab and Partition of Bengal,

00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:35.050
because that's what it was.

00:33:35.050 --> 00:33:39.190
The problem of Kashmir
starts much later.

00:33:39.190 --> 00:33:43.250
The problem of Kashmir starts
in October 1947 on the 21st

00:33:43.250 --> 00:33:48.720
of October, 1947 when Kashmir
is attacked by the tribal.

00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:52.420
And what our forefathers -- my
father, my aunt, my uncle used

00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:55.460
to tell us is that they never
could go back to this part

00:33:55.460 --> 00:33:56.810
of Kashmir, which
is in Pakistan,

00:33:56.810 --> 00:33:59.400
because they then were
shifted and ousted,

00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:01.240
and rebuild their
lives in [inaudible].

00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:09.260
But he used to tell that on the
morning of 21st October, 1947,

00:34:09.260 --> 00:34:13.350
our aunt and uncles got
up to a huge war cry,

00:34:13.350 --> 00:34:15.450
which was Hindu [inaudible]
or Sikh [inaudible].

00:34:15.450 --> 00:34:19.530
That is a Persian word,
"[Inaudible] the Hindus

00:34:19.530 --> 00:34:20.830
and behead the Sikhs."

00:34:20.830 --> 00:34:23.940
And on this bridge, about
300 people were rounded up,

00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:25.260
306 were rounded up.

00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:27.090
And this is the first
attack of Kashmir

00:34:27.090 --> 00:34:28.390
which happens [inaudible].

00:34:28.390 --> 00:34:30.730
And they were shot
on both the sides.

00:34:30.730 --> 00:34:34.820
And then many bodies fell.

00:34:34.820 --> 00:34:39.780
My mother-in-law's parents
both died on this bridge

00:34:39.780 --> 00:34:42.120
in this unfortunate incident.

00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:44.130
There's a chapter in
this first book called

00:34:44.130 --> 00:34:45.430
"Meeting Moody [phonetic]."

00:34:45.430 --> 00:34:46.730
Moody was [inaudible],

00:34:46.730 --> 00:34:50.490
a Sikh girl who now
lives in [inaudible].

00:34:50.490 --> 00:34:51.790
She's my distant aunt.

00:34:51.790 --> 00:34:55.990
And she lost both her
parents; she was just four

00:34:55.990 --> 00:34:59.040
and a half years old,
on this same bridge.

00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:03.340
And she has the impression so
strong in her mind that even

00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:07.500
at the age of 75 years,
she can recount everything

00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:09.250
that happened that day.

00:35:09.250 --> 00:35:12.120
Now, a four-and-a-half
year old child recounting,

00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:15.380
that's amazing; because I can't
recount what I actually --

00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:17.820
what I may have experienced
at the age of ten or 12.

00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:20.640
But here's a child -- here's
an old woman who at the age

00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:23.120
of four-and-a- half years what
she experiences, recounting it.

00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:25.180
And I wanted to go to
this bridge basically

00:35:25.180 --> 00:35:26.480
to pick up the soil.

00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:29.830
I wanted to pass it down
to our next generation,

00:35:29.830 --> 00:35:32.190
our two daughters, just
to remind them that,

00:35:32.190 --> 00:35:34.760
"Wherever you go in this global
village that we are living

00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:37.370
in today, don't forget
your roots."

00:35:37.370 --> 00:35:41.640
And therefore, I decided
in that six-month period

00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:43.720
that I was cooling down after
my American Express career

00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:46.780
that I must go to Pakistan.

00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:49.310
All my vision was that I
wanted to go into Pakistan.

00:35:49.310 --> 00:35:50.820
I didn't go to write a book.

00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:53.710
I just decided to head
towards [inaudible].

00:35:53.710 --> 00:35:56.960
I decided like every
other Sikh that I must go

00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:59.050
and visit [inaudible].

00:35:59.050 --> 00:36:00.750
But I also knew from
the history books

00:36:00.750 --> 00:36:02.760
that a huge glorious chapter

00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:05.640
of my tradition actually
happened in these lands.

00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:07.060
So I wanted to go
and experience,

00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:09.250
"Are there some remnants there?"

00:36:09.250 --> 00:36:11.960
I had no idea whether
I will find anything.

00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:16.790
And as I therefore embarked on
this journey, on the 15th day

00:36:16.790 --> 00:36:19.610
of my journey, I got a 30-day
visa to enter the first time.

00:36:19.610 --> 00:36:22.440
On the 15th day, I did reach
[inaudible], and as I picked

00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:25.900
up the soil, something within
me said, "Don't do this."

00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:28.550
Because passing to the
next generation the soil,

00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:33.520
you might be passing down
a memory which I don't want

00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:36.330
to pass down of hatred
between communities.

00:36:36.330 --> 00:36:37.630
And therefore, I left it.

00:36:37.630 --> 00:36:38.930
And I think that I
did the right thing

00:36:38.930 --> 00:36:41.790
because what I've done
is more than the soil is

00:36:41.790 --> 00:36:44.390
to capture the experiences
in these two books;

00:36:44.390 --> 00:36:46.090
that's more valuable
than the soil.

00:36:46.090 --> 00:36:48.880
But when I saw the
turning of the Jhelum River

00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:52.800
at the [inaudible] -- this is a
town where my father was born,

00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:56.270
that u-turn symbolized that
yes the communities did make a

00:36:56.270 --> 00:36:58.170
u-turn in 1947.

00:36:58.170 --> 00:37:02.270
Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs chose
to look away from each other.

00:37:02.270 --> 00:37:07.140
And therefore, when I came
back -- I had been to 36 cities

00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:09.590
and villages in 30 days, and
I thought it was important

00:37:09.590 --> 00:37:11.270
to write this journey
in the form

00:37:11.270 --> 00:37:13.600
of a picture travel
log expressing all

00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:16.230
that I had experienced and
telling a little bit of history,

00:37:16.230 --> 00:37:19.150
so that posterity can
remember that seven decades

00:37:19.150 --> 00:37:21.810
after Partition, someone went
and at that point of time he saw

00:37:21.810 --> 00:37:24.330
where the heritage was standing.

00:37:24.330 --> 00:37:26.840
Seventy percent of a heritage
is finished is my estimate.

00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:28.140
It's my gut estimate.

00:37:28.140 --> 00:37:30.250
There's nothing to -- there's
no detail to validate that;

00:37:30.250 --> 00:37:34.050
that's my gut estimate
that 70% is finished.

00:37:34.050 --> 00:37:36.380
But yet, I felt that it was
important to document it

00:37:36.380 --> 00:37:37.710
that we should have
some remnants

00:37:37.710 --> 00:37:39.270
to remind our future generations

00:37:39.270 --> 00:37:42.480
that this is what it was
seven decades after Partition.

00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:45.200
But you know what,
sometimes journeys that seem

00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:49.830
to have ended actually are
boiling to take another a shape,

00:37:49.830 --> 00:37:51.370
and that's exactly what
was happening to me,

00:37:51.370 --> 00:37:53.550
because when I published
this book, I was called

00:37:53.550 --> 00:37:55.830
at many forums around the
world to talk about it.

00:37:55.830 --> 00:37:57.130
And as I kept on talking,

00:37:57.130 --> 00:38:01.100
I realized that having published
a book, I had gone on a journey

00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:04.240
around the world speaking
at about some 75 seminars

00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:05.910
around the world in
about eight months.

00:38:05.910 --> 00:38:08.610
At that point, I felt the
book needs to be left,

00:38:08.610 --> 00:38:10.430
I need to go back to
my corporate world,

00:38:10.430 --> 00:38:12.070
and I need to start looking

00:38:12.070 --> 00:38:15.590
at my daily chores
of earning a living.

00:38:15.590 --> 00:38:18.930
But you know what, as I took
up a job deep inside me,

00:38:18.930 --> 00:38:20.530
something was disturbing me.

00:38:20.530 --> 00:38:22.800
And what was disturbing me
was that I am in my journey

00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:24.890
of the first book
had stood at Jamrud,

00:38:24.890 --> 00:38:27.060
right at the [inaudible] Pass

00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:29.440
where [inaudible] had
made the fort of Jamrud,

00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:34.090
and thereafter no envision has
happened from the Khyber Pass

00:38:34.090 --> 00:38:37.780
for a good 200-odd years.

00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:39.830
Now, is it because of
Jamrud, or is this a matter

00:38:39.830 --> 00:38:41.410
of destiny, I don't know.

00:38:41.410 --> 00:38:45.680
But yet when the fort was made
after that, the thousand years

00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:48.170
of envisions from the
central Asian lands

00:38:48.170 --> 00:38:51.190
into the Indian subcontinent
did stop.

00:38:51.190 --> 00:38:55.420
I could not go inside there,
because [inaudible] died there,

00:38:55.420 --> 00:38:57.480
and yet I wanted to
experience that place

00:38:57.480 --> 00:38:58.900
where his body was kept.

00:38:58.900 --> 00:39:01.920
And what was there inside that
fort I could not experience it.

00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:05.530
Attock -- as I stood at the
Attock River, I was reminded

00:39:05.530 --> 00:39:08.890
of that journey that
Alexander Burnes did,

00:39:08.890 --> 00:39:11.670
because as the Treaty
of Amritsar was signed

00:39:11.670 --> 00:39:17.510
between the British and
the Ranjit Singh in 1809,

00:39:17.510 --> 00:39:19.320
saying both sides will
respect each other,

00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:21.620
the British already
started sending spies

00:39:21.620 --> 00:39:24.460
into Pakistan -- into Punjab.

00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:27.770
And the mission was basically
to find out what is the power

00:39:27.770 --> 00:39:29.550
of this kingdom,
can we do something,

00:39:29.550 --> 00:39:32.330
can we tomorrow take it over?

00:39:32.330 --> 00:39:33.990
And as those missions went,

00:39:33.990 --> 00:39:38.220
many of the spy missions
submitted the reports --

00:39:38.220 --> 00:39:40.350
of course, all of them
submitted reports to Calcutta,

00:39:40.350 --> 00:39:43.290
to East India Company, but
some wrote their personal

00:39:43.290 --> 00:39:44.770
travel logs.

00:39:44.770 --> 00:39:46.230
And I had read these
travel logs.

00:39:46.230 --> 00:39:49.140
One of them was William
Moorcroft in 1809 --

00:39:49.140 --> 00:39:54.410
1819 he went into Lahore.

00:39:54.410 --> 00:39:56.710
And then he went
right up to Kashmir

00:39:56.710 --> 00:39:59.280
to Ladock [phonetic]
from Lahore.

00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:03.210
But the most interesting one was
where I'm talking about Attock,

00:40:03.210 --> 00:40:06.430
because Alexander Burnes had
never stepped into India.

00:40:06.430 --> 00:40:08.510
Later on in the first
Afghan war,

00:40:08.510 --> 00:40:10.370
he was hacked to death in Kabul.

00:40:10.370 --> 00:40:12.980
But he had never come to India.

00:40:12.980 --> 00:40:15.440
And he was given this
mission that, "We want to find

00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:17.480
out can ships be
taken inside Punjab.

00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:19.330
How can you take
ships inside Punjab,

00:40:19.330 --> 00:40:21.530
and Punjab does not
even touch the sea?"

00:40:21.530 --> 00:40:25.670
So he was put onto
a ship and said,

00:40:25.670 --> 00:40:27.810
"Here are five hyper
degree [phonetic] horses.

00:40:27.810 --> 00:40:30.270
Take them through
the Arabian Sea,

00:40:30.270 --> 00:40:32.770
take it into the industrial
world, and sail it upwards

00:40:32.770 --> 00:40:35.940
and see how deep can
you dig the horse --

00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:39.090
the ship inside in
the industrial world,

00:40:39.090 --> 00:40:42.310
and see here it goes and docks?"

00:40:42.310 --> 00:40:45.290
And he sailed with high
hyper-degree horses

00:40:45.290 --> 00:40:47.880
to gift it [inaudible]
in Lahore.

00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:51.570
That was just a --
gifting was just an excuse

00:40:51.570 --> 00:40:53.670
to leave the secret mission.

00:40:53.670 --> 00:40:56.940
And he docked the ship at the
Attock Fort, on the industry

00:40:56.940 --> 00:40:58.390
where -- and I was
standing there,

00:40:58.390 --> 00:41:01.740
and that site looked familiar
because when as a young kid,

00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:04.600
I read "The Journey
of Alexander Burnes",

00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:07.310
that picture still
imprinted in the mind.

00:41:07.310 --> 00:41:09.170
And when I was standing in
the first journey wanting

00:41:09.170 --> 00:41:11.630
to go inside the Attock
Fort, I could not go inside,

00:41:11.630 --> 00:41:13.420
because both Jamrud
and Attock are

00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:15.650
under the control of
the Pakistan army.

00:41:15.650 --> 00:41:16.950
Now, layers of generations

00:41:16.950 --> 00:41:22.280
and dynasties have actually
played a role in Attock,

00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:26.180
like for instance the
[inaudible] under the Sikh rule

00:41:26.180 --> 00:41:29.600
in Lahore, then the British --

00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:31.930
now the Pakistanis are
actually playing a role.

00:41:31.930 --> 00:41:33.230
But I wanted to go inside

00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:34.530
because I could see
that picture.

00:41:34.530 --> 00:41:38.200
Alexander Burnes came and
docked his ship here to prove

00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:41.690
that ships and the navy
could be brought into Punjab.

00:41:41.690 --> 00:41:44.230
And if the British
wanted to attack Punjab

00:41:44.230 --> 00:41:46.000
from both sides they could
compress it by bringing

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:47.650
in the navy, and from
this side bringing

00:41:47.650 --> 00:41:49.460
in the army from [inaudible].

00:41:49.460 --> 00:41:51.480
Nothing happened,
actually, on that front.

00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:55.220
But Alexander Burnes
wrote his travel log,

00:41:55.220 --> 00:41:57.350
how he took the horses
to Lahore and gifted it

00:41:57.350 --> 00:41:59.920
to the Ranjit Singh,
beautiful travel logs.

00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:02.160
And I in my mind
after the first book

00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:08.030
in the nights I would see the
dreams of Attock and Jamrud

00:42:08.030 --> 00:42:10.090
as a mission had
been incomplete.

00:42:10.090 --> 00:42:13.070
As I looked at this picture
of DGF Newhall [phonetic],

00:42:13.070 --> 00:42:15.760
which after the second annual
sea coordinate [phonetic]

00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:18.940
in 1949-1851, DGF
Newhall travels

00:42:18.940 --> 00:42:22.370
to the Tanamal [phonetic]
Range, along the River Indus,

00:42:22.370 --> 00:42:24.550
and [inaudible] and
looks down and marks

00:42:24.550 --> 00:42:26.560
where all the Sikh forts were.

00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:28.310
And this publication
was published later

00:42:28.310 --> 00:42:29.930
on about 20 years later.

00:42:29.930 --> 00:42:33.080
And I'm wondering in 1947,

00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:36.280
the Sikh community was pretty
much resident in these lands

00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:39.250
until 1947, after
which they were ousted.

00:42:39.250 --> 00:42:42.120
And why is it that I can't
find any book since the journey

00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:46.590
of 1851 of DGF Newhall
until the time of 1947

00:42:46.590 --> 00:42:49.180
when cameras has
existed, why hasn't anyone

00:42:49.180 --> 00:42:51.790
from my community gone and
simply taken a panoramic image

00:42:51.790 --> 00:42:55.760
of that same land and mark where
the forts had once existed?

00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:57.990
These were marked
forts, small forts.

00:42:57.990 --> 00:42:59.930
So the community today
only associates [inaudible]

00:42:59.930 --> 00:43:03.840
with Jamrud, and does not know
anything more about [inaudible]

00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:09.960
or his role that he played in
27 forts along the River Indus.

00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:13.900
There's documented evidence
of that in the history.

00:43:13.900 --> 00:43:15.200
So we don't know.

00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:18.460
And I'm thinking this is
valuable to be documented again,

00:43:18.460 --> 00:43:20.150
but I am struggling through as

00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:21.830
to how does one go
back to Pakistan?

00:43:21.830 --> 00:43:25.530
I had experienced it, and I was
wondering how does one go back,

00:43:25.530 --> 00:43:27.970
and how does one document this?

00:43:27.970 --> 00:43:32.440
But then when you start
believing in something,

00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:36.640
strangely enough, the
energies do come together.

00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:41.140
And I'm blessed because the
Pakistan government themselves

00:43:41.140 --> 00:43:45.220
invited me for a seminar --
for a conference in Islamabad.

00:43:45.220 --> 00:43:47.690
And what I had done with my
first book was wherever I went

00:43:47.690 --> 00:43:50.380
around the world, I'm
accepting the fact

00:43:50.380 --> 00:43:52.910
that Partition has have
happened, I cannot change it,

00:43:52.910 --> 00:43:55.210
Pakistan cannot change
it, we cannot change it.

00:43:55.210 --> 00:43:57.940
What can we learn from this,
what can we talk in terms

00:43:57.940 --> 00:44:00.200
of human values, and what
can we actually bring

00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:01.980
about as a positive
change is what I was trying

00:44:01.980 --> 00:44:03.280
to spread as a message.

00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:05.950
And I think the Pakistan
establishment did appreciate

00:44:05.950 --> 00:44:09.110
that the person was not trying
to make it a political pitch

00:44:09.110 --> 00:44:11.270
out of it, because
there's enough of politics

00:44:11.270 --> 00:44:15.250
and much [inaudible] that's been
happening for years and years.

00:44:15.250 --> 00:44:16.550
What do we go going forward?

00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:22.310
And I was invited to Islamabad
to take part in a conference

00:44:22.310 --> 00:44:25.370
where -- when my first
publication was --

00:44:25.370 --> 00:44:27.310
I was not being invited
to talk there,

00:44:27.310 --> 00:44:28.610
but I think they recognized

00:44:28.610 --> 00:44:30.670
that [inaudible]
someone's done some work

00:44:30.670 --> 00:44:33.860
on Pakistan's heritage,
and so they invited me.

00:44:33.860 --> 00:44:37.000
In my mind, I thought that
this is the right opportunity

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:38.420
to ask the Pakistan government

00:44:38.420 --> 00:44:40.350
that if you think I've
done something all right,

00:44:40.350 --> 00:44:42.450
then please open
the gates of Jamrud

00:44:42.450 --> 00:44:43.840
and Attock and show it to me.

00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:46.530
That is all that I had
asked for, and if possible,

00:44:46.530 --> 00:44:49.130
please take me to the
[inaudible] area to see

00:44:49.130 --> 00:44:52.070
that forts where they had
existed are there still some

00:44:52.070 --> 00:44:53.370
remains lying there?

00:44:53.370 --> 00:44:55.240
That's all I envisioned
for and asked.

00:44:55.240 --> 00:44:58.550
And as I landed in
Pakistan, a beautiful energy

00:44:58.550 --> 00:45:00.270
by the government, and as well

00:45:00.270 --> 00:45:03.530
as the people started
engulfing me once again.

00:45:03.530 --> 00:45:06.750
And I say this, the work is
thanks to the people of Pakistan

00:45:06.750 --> 00:45:08.880
who have actually
enabled this for me,

00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:12.530
because as they embraced me,
the energy started engulfing me

00:45:12.530 --> 00:45:15.510
to a point I asked
myself, "Do I go back,

00:45:15.510 --> 00:45:17.060
or do I continue with this?"

00:45:17.060 --> 00:45:18.380
And I think I made
the right choice,

00:45:18.380 --> 00:45:19.730
because I could have
easily gone back.

00:45:19.730 --> 00:45:21.030
There was a job waiting for me;

00:45:21.030 --> 00:45:23.300
I would have actually just
been doing a nine to five,

00:45:23.300 --> 00:45:27.190
but I decided to just let
the energy take me forward.

00:45:27.190 --> 00:45:29.550
And as it took me
forward, I stayed there

00:45:29.550 --> 00:45:32.400
for another 50 days, of
which 40 days I spent

00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:35.570
in the search traveling across
Pakistan from Baltistan,

00:45:35.570 --> 00:45:40.120
to Kibor, to Punjab, to
Sindh and Balochistan,

00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:43.550
and having realized after about
40 days of journey and 50 days

00:45:43.550 --> 00:45:47.690
in Pakistan that I'd been to 90
cities and villages this time.

00:45:47.690 --> 00:45:50.500
And when I came back, it
was two humungous data

00:45:50.500 --> 00:45:52.660
that I had actually
gotten, all for heritage --

00:45:52.660 --> 00:45:55.900
a composite heritage of all
of our communities together.

00:45:55.900 --> 00:45:59.130
I thought that this
needs to be, again,

00:45:59.130 --> 00:46:01.940
documented because
it has not been done.

00:46:01.940 --> 00:46:03.700
The future generation needs

00:46:03.700 --> 00:46:05.790
to know what had
churned on these lands.

00:46:05.790 --> 00:46:07.560
And therefore, I didn't go
back into the corporate world

00:46:07.560 --> 00:46:08.860
and started documenting it.

00:46:08.860 --> 00:46:12.110
I will share a few stories
before I move on to what the --

00:46:12.110 --> 00:46:14.660
a sense of the presentation is
as to what has Amardeep learned

00:46:14.660 --> 00:46:16.430
out of his journeys
across Pakistan.

00:46:16.430 --> 00:46:26.170
The -- I want to talk about
the remains of a Sikh Gurdwara,

00:46:26.170 --> 00:46:30.000
a Gurdwara, a place of
Sikh worship along --

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:31.300
near the river in this --

00:46:31.300 --> 00:46:34.010
at a village called
"Codfatikan" [phonetic].

00:46:34.010 --> 00:46:36.340
Codfatikan -- this
is the Gurdwara --

00:46:36.340 --> 00:46:37.940
these are the remains.

00:46:37.940 --> 00:46:40.800
The walls have actually
all broken down.

00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:43.700
The gate is just
still standing there.

00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:47.410
I go inside there, and I'm
appreciating the beautiful

00:46:47.410 --> 00:46:50.520
frescoes inside this
[inaudible] here.

00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:57.730
And what I see is that our
forefathers had a very secular

00:46:57.730 --> 00:47:02.880
pluralistic mindset; because on
these frescoes, it was Punjabi

00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:04.200
that they would have left him.

00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:06.820
It was not faiths that
they would have left him.

00:47:06.820 --> 00:47:11.160
It was a composite culture, of
stories of the lands of Punjab,

00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:13.900
whether it be [inaudible],
whether it be

00:47:13.900 --> 00:47:16.860
Than Singh himself,
or if there --

00:47:16.860 --> 00:47:20.210
at places, even [inaudible],
you know?

00:47:20.210 --> 00:47:21.990
I think what they are trying

00:47:21.990 --> 00:47:25.280
to represent is what
Punjab was representing

00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:26.650
as a cultural aspect.

00:47:26.650 --> 00:47:30.550
Faith and culture are
two sides of a coin,

00:47:30.550 --> 00:47:32.790
because we cannot
segregate the two things.

00:47:32.790 --> 00:47:35.690
And yes, you're freed
and unorganized, thinking

00:47:35.690 --> 00:47:38.590
and religion takes a form
over a period of time.

00:47:38.590 --> 00:47:41.730
But yet, cultural aspects cannot
be ignored because faiths emerge

00:47:41.730 --> 00:47:44.890
from the foundation of cultures
that churn in a particular land,

00:47:44.890 --> 00:47:46.210
and the stories that
churn there.

00:47:46.210 --> 00:47:49.500
And I'm looking at these
frescoes in a pretty sad state,

00:47:49.500 --> 00:47:52.090
because for seven decades
the community is not there,

00:47:52.090 --> 00:47:55.300
they have not been maintained,
they're nearly finishing off.

00:47:55.300 --> 00:47:57.860
And my first thought
that comes to my mind is

00:47:57.860 --> 00:48:01.470
that the Sikh community
is in a very sad state.

00:48:01.470 --> 00:48:02.890
And I coined a statement
altogether,

00:48:02.890 --> 00:48:05.320
which I say it all the time
when I go around the world,

00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:09.140
"The Sikh community lost it
there, which is in Pakistan

00:48:09.140 --> 00:48:13.570
in the creation of 1947, and
moving out of the country,

00:48:13.570 --> 00:48:16.380
but the Sikh government
destroyed it here,

00:48:16.380 --> 00:48:18.980
which is in East Punjab.

00:48:18.980 --> 00:48:22.940
Because frescoes and
monuments like this,

00:48:22.940 --> 00:48:25.690
there are none existing
in East Punjab now.

00:48:25.690 --> 00:48:30.690
If our heritage, although in a
sad state -- because we have --

00:48:30.690 --> 00:48:32.380
we are not existing
in these lands,

00:48:32.380 --> 00:48:37.690
and therefore no one can
take care of it, if they're

00:48:37.690 --> 00:48:42.910
yet existing, they are
existing in the last forms

00:48:42.910 --> 00:48:45.890
in the lands of Pakistan.

00:48:45.890 --> 00:48:49.160
In East Punjab, we have
destroyed it all ourselves

00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:53.920
because we have a fancy for
modernizing our structures

00:48:55.210 --> 00:48:59.240
with marble and gold,
replacing frescoes.

00:48:59.240 --> 00:49:03.100
Replacing artworks with a
preference of white marble

00:49:03.100 --> 00:49:06.110
and materialistic gold,
we are leaning nothing

00:49:06.110 --> 00:49:10.470
for our next generation to delve
into to the beautiful stories

00:49:10.470 --> 00:49:12.350
that these frescoes can read.

00:49:12.350 --> 00:49:13.650
There's nothing left.

00:49:13.650 --> 00:49:15.620
And someone in Delhi had asked
me when I was presenting as to,

00:49:15.620 --> 00:49:20.210
"When will you do this work for
the Sikh legacy in East Punjab?"

00:49:20.210 --> 00:49:23.640
And my answer was, "I will
never probably do it."

00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:29.100
Because my soul finds itself
flying in the stratosphere

00:49:29.100 --> 00:49:31.850
when I go to Pakistan,
because these monuments take me

00:49:31.850 --> 00:49:34.670
to a different realm altogether.

00:49:34.670 --> 00:49:37.740
Only I know what I
experienced in these lands.

00:49:37.740 --> 00:49:39.960
In East Punjab, I
cannot feel that.

00:49:39.960 --> 00:49:42.240
I feel dead monuments.

00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:45.210
I feel the whiteness and
the materialistic imprint

00:49:45.210 --> 00:49:48.920
of gold is leaving nothing
for the next generation

00:49:48.920 --> 00:49:51.430
to really understand
from where we emerged,

00:49:51.430 --> 00:49:53.870
and what value system our
forefathers were trying

00:49:53.870 --> 00:49:56.730
to tell us to the art forms.

00:49:56.730 --> 00:49:59.480
But as I was standing here,
invariably in my stories

00:49:59.480 --> 00:50:04.040
that you'll find in the book,
one or the other old man,

00:50:04.040 --> 00:50:06.300
as we call as "Babas" [phonetic]
will definitely appear.

00:50:06.300 --> 00:50:07.990
And a Baba appeared out here.

00:50:07.990 --> 00:50:10.670
And I've called this Gurdwara
as "Sultan Tansing" [phonetic],

00:50:10.670 --> 00:50:13.320
but the Gurdwara actually
is called as "Baba Tansing".

00:50:13.320 --> 00:50:15.040
In the Punjabi terminology,
and especially

00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:17.790
in the Sikh terminology,
the people whom we revere,

00:50:17.790 --> 00:50:21.860
the saints, and the
elevated people as "Baba",

00:50:21.860 --> 00:50:23.670
the one who is the
man with the wisdom.

00:50:23.670 --> 00:50:28.330
But in the Islamic
tradition, a man with a power,

00:50:28.330 --> 00:50:32.890
be it spiritual power,
or a materialistic power,

00:50:32.890 --> 00:50:38.620
or a power of military
power is called a "sultan".

00:50:38.620 --> 00:50:41.910
So out here, the Baba
Tansing Gurdwara,

00:50:41.910 --> 00:50:44.650
the villagers now call
it a "Sultan Tansing".

00:50:44.650 --> 00:50:47.180
And I was standing out
here, and a villager,

00:50:47.180 --> 00:50:49.130
this old man came in, and
he started talking to me.

00:50:49.130 --> 00:50:50.430
He says "Salam" to me.

00:50:50.430 --> 00:50:52.570
And I said "Salam" to him also.

00:50:52.570 --> 00:50:53.950
And he told a few things.

00:50:53.950 --> 00:50:57.610
One thing he said was,
"Every Friday, we still come

00:50:57.610 --> 00:51:00.500
to this Gurdwara
we light a lamp."

00:51:00.500 --> 00:51:02.510
"Duma" [phonetic] is a
Friday pass [phonetic].

00:51:02.510 --> 00:51:05.190
And after that what he said is,
"All the villagers come here

00:51:05.190 --> 00:51:06.610
and as a mark of respect

00:51:06.610 --> 00:51:09.820
for seven decades we've been
lighting a lamp out here."

00:51:09.820 --> 00:51:12.790
Now, whatever the
politics may have done,

00:51:12.790 --> 00:51:15.930
whatever the divisions
may have been, the mans

00:51:15.930 --> 00:51:20.380
or the villages seeing voice
of humanity is still wanting

00:51:20.380 --> 00:51:23.410
to associate with the fact that
this was the largest monument

00:51:23.410 --> 00:51:26.240
of that village, and a
tradition must be kept alive,

00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:31.090
and therefore they
put a lamp out there.

00:51:31.090 --> 00:51:34.390
And as I'm looking at the
various writings on the wall,

00:51:34.390 --> 00:51:37.040
at one place -- at most of
the places where things are,

00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:39.210
our forefathers used to
only use two languages.

00:51:39.210 --> 00:51:40.900
The more westwards you
go, you will only find

00:51:40.900 --> 00:51:44.810
in the Sikh Gurdwaras,
only Urdu and [inaudible].

00:51:44.810 --> 00:51:48.020
There's to be no Hindi
[inaudible] script.

00:51:48.020 --> 00:51:51.630
And as I'm looking at the Urdu
and the Guruki [phonetic],

00:51:51.630 --> 00:51:54.920
at the Urdu places, there
has been some black paint

00:51:54.920 --> 00:51:56.220
which has been put through.

00:51:56.220 --> 00:51:57.520
And I could read through that,

00:51:57.520 --> 00:52:00.300
that wherever "Baba
Tansing" has been written,

00:52:00.300 --> 00:52:01.600
it's been blackened.

00:52:01.600 --> 00:52:04.410
But adjacent to that,
wherever [inaudible]

00:52:04.410 --> 00:52:07.520
"Baba Tansing" is written,
it's not been blackened.

00:52:07.520 --> 00:52:11.340
So I asked the Baba himself,
the man of wisdom who was there,

00:52:11.340 --> 00:52:13.960
"Why have they blackened
the places where in Urdu,

00:52:13.960 --> 00:52:16.110
'Baba Tansing' is written?

00:52:16.110 --> 00:52:17.530
And his reply to
me was beautiful.

00:52:17.530 --> 00:52:20.120
What he says is, "You
know, the villagers say

00:52:20.120 --> 00:52:23.810
that he was indeed Baba
Tansing for the Sikhs,

00:52:23.810 --> 00:52:26.280
but now he's our Sultan Tansing.

00:52:26.280 --> 00:52:30.090
It's yet the emotion for that
man, emotion for that place,

00:52:30.090 --> 00:52:32.260
which is being held
on, is the value

00:52:32.260 --> 00:52:35.030
that I want actually people to
take away from these things,

00:52:35.030 --> 00:52:38.810
that humans do care;
humans do care.

00:52:38.810 --> 00:52:45.090
But ill-fated well, I --
unfortunately the narratives --

00:52:45.090 --> 00:52:47.340
you know, history is his
story, whose story you want

00:52:47.340 --> 00:52:49.720
to listen to; it's
always biased.

00:52:49.720 --> 00:52:53.920
And it always takes
rising above to understand

00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:55.850
that sometimes history
has to be understood.

00:52:55.850 --> 00:52:59.390
Most of the time, history
needs to be laid out of biases

00:52:59.390 --> 00:53:00.710
to be really understood.

00:53:00.710 --> 00:53:05.660
Unfortunately, when I presented
the Sikh legacy in Pakistan

00:53:05.660 --> 00:53:08.520
in terms of our two
books in Delhi,

00:53:08.520 --> 00:53:10.320
one of the [inaudible]
actually got them,

00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:13.080
and she made a very valid point
because I was alluding to it.

00:53:13.080 --> 00:53:14.810
I said, "The Sikhs were
basically a cucumber

00:53:14.810 --> 00:53:16.550
in the sandwich

00:53:16.550 --> 00:53:18.780
in the [inaudible]
concept of Hindu and Sikhs.

00:53:18.780 --> 00:53:20.730
Hindus and Muslims
cannot stay together.

00:53:20.730 --> 00:53:24.780
And what basically what happened
was that our entire history,

00:53:24.780 --> 00:53:27.740
unfortunately, doesn't find
prominence in the textbook

00:53:27.740 --> 00:53:30.450
in Pakistan, but our history
does not even find prominence

00:53:30.450 --> 00:53:32.370
in the textbooks in India.

00:53:32.370 --> 00:53:34.570
It's just a passing
mention of the Sikh gurus,

00:53:34.570 --> 00:53:38.110
and it finishes off; because
I've studied history out there ,

00:53:38.110 --> 00:53:40.020
nd I've seen the
history books in Pakistan

00:53:40.020 --> 00:53:42.400
of the Punjabi University.

00:53:42.400 --> 00:53:48.490
And looking at that it pains
me, because the history

00:53:48.490 --> 00:53:53.360
which basically churn on these
lands has been forgotten,

00:53:53.360 --> 00:53:58.960
because probably in Pakistan,
this was a non-Islamic era,

00:53:58.960 --> 00:54:00.840
and in India, it's a
history that churned

00:54:00.840 --> 00:54:03.010
in the lands of Pakistan.

00:54:03.010 --> 00:54:05.910
So from both the sides, I see
it's the unfortunate thing is

00:54:05.910 --> 00:54:08.520
that the Sikhs have lost
the element of the history,

00:54:08.520 --> 00:54:10.410
and therefore we own
the responsibility

00:54:10.410 --> 00:54:12.220
of owning the history ourselves;

00:54:12.220 --> 00:54:13.910
no one's going to
protect it for us.

00:54:13.910 --> 00:54:16.320
We have to protect it ourselves.

00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:19.160
And therefore, when I looked
at the Partition violence --

00:54:19.160 --> 00:54:22.860
I must remind that Partition
violence [inaudible] divided,

00:54:22.860 --> 00:54:26.140
which is unfortunate, because
Punjab could not have been

00:54:26.140 --> 00:54:28.650
divided in any form or any way.

00:54:28.650 --> 00:54:31.010
There were multiple
formulas being expressed,

00:54:31.010 --> 00:54:35.190
but yet what happened was on
the blood of the common Punjabi,

00:54:35.190 --> 00:54:36.660
two nations were created.

00:54:36.660 --> 00:54:40.010
But Punjab was a composite
culture where Muslims, Hindus,

00:54:40.010 --> 00:54:42.340
and Sikhs had stayed
together for centuries,

00:54:42.340 --> 00:54:44.020
and lived, coexisted together.

00:54:44.020 --> 00:54:45.320
But it was divided.

00:54:45.320 --> 00:54:47.490
But what people have
forgotten is

00:54:47.490 --> 00:54:50.770
that Punjab was the last
state to experience violence

00:54:50.770 --> 00:54:54.730
in the violence of India
that divided the nation.

00:54:54.730 --> 00:54:58.870
The nation's violence did
not start from Punjab.

00:54:58.870 --> 00:55:01.550
It started from as
far away in the East

00:55:01.550 --> 00:55:05.160
in Calcutta in 1946 August.

00:55:05.160 --> 00:55:07.230
And it spread into
[inaudible] in Bengal,

00:55:07.230 --> 00:55:11.220
it spread into [inaudible],
Muslims got massacred.

00:55:11.220 --> 00:55:16.830
And as waves of Muslims
moved towards Sindh,

00:55:16.830 --> 00:55:18.140
many passed through Punjab.

00:55:18.140 --> 00:55:19.930
Punjab was fine because
Punjab was being ruled

00:55:19.930 --> 00:55:23.780
by a secular party of
[inaudible] who had Muslims,

00:55:23.780 --> 00:55:27.970
Hindus, and Sikhs collectively
representing the Punjab

00:55:27.970 --> 00:55:30.310
government under
the British regime.

00:55:30.310 --> 00:55:34.340
And Punjab did not face
any problem until actually

00:55:34.340 --> 00:55:36.320
under pressure [inaudible]
resigns on the 3rd

00:55:36.320 --> 00:55:41.640
of March 1947, resulting in
a questioning by the Sikh

00:55:41.640 --> 00:55:43.810
and the Hindu leadership,
and thereafter,

00:55:43.810 --> 00:55:52.180
a wave of genocide emerges in
the villages around Rawalpindi.

00:55:52.180 --> 00:55:55.850
And this particular village,
[inaudible], is documented

00:55:55.850 --> 00:55:59.640
to be the first village
where the violence occurred.

00:55:59.640 --> 00:56:01.470
And this is the remains
of the [inaudible].

00:56:01.470 --> 00:56:03.800
And I wanted to go
here to document this

00:56:03.800 --> 00:56:07.660
because what happened here
was 75 women on the fifth

00:56:07.660 --> 00:56:10.570
of sixth day after being locked
inside the [inaudible] came out

00:56:10.570 --> 00:56:12.500
and jumped inside this well.

00:56:12.500 --> 00:56:14.040
And I wanted to document this.

00:56:14.040 --> 00:56:17.100
And I went inside to Khalsa,
and I was looking for the well.

00:56:17.100 --> 00:56:20.460
And this Baba, again,
an old man of wisdom,

00:56:20.460 --> 00:56:22.010
strangely appears on the road.

00:56:22.010 --> 00:56:24.190
And I stopped the [inaudible]
and I looked down at him

00:56:24.190 --> 00:56:27.200
and I got down and I went to
him and I said, "Baba Salam."

00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:30.030
And he looks at me and he says,
"Where have you come from?"

00:56:30.030 --> 00:56:32.100
And he was surprised.

00:56:32.100 --> 00:56:35.170
And he gave me a hug and I
asked him, "Baba, tell me,

00:56:35.170 --> 00:56:39.450
where is that well where
75 women, history tells us,

00:56:39.450 --> 00:56:44.550
jumped inside on the seventh
of eighth of March 1947?"

00:56:44.550 --> 00:56:47.330
He took out his spectacles,
wiped his tear, and he says,

00:56:47.330 --> 00:56:49.600
"You know what, I
was 18 years old

00:56:49.600 --> 00:56:51.890
and it happened in
front of my eyes."

00:56:51.890 --> 00:56:54.610
What is the probability
of walking on the streets

00:56:54.610 --> 00:56:56.370
and you stumble upon someone

00:56:56.370 --> 00:57:00.130
who has been a live
witness to the entire event?

00:57:00.130 --> 00:57:04.410
And as I actually followed
him, he took me to the place.

00:57:04.410 --> 00:57:07.120
And I felt that this well
needs to be documented

00:57:07.120 --> 00:57:10.340
because the tragedy of Punjab,
which resulted in displacing

00:57:10.340 --> 00:57:12.920
of communities and
creating a drift among us

00:57:12.920 --> 00:57:16.360
for forever actually
I had to document it.

00:57:16.360 --> 00:57:19.320
And I've done that in this
book, because it's important

00:57:19.320 --> 00:57:20.620
for the next few generations.

00:57:20.620 --> 00:57:22.110
I again thank the
Pakistan government

00:57:22.110 --> 00:57:25.770
that they enabled my trip inside
the Jamrud Fort, and this time

00:57:25.770 --> 00:57:28.530
in the second book, I was
standing on top of this bastion

00:57:28.530 --> 00:57:32.390
and looking on this side
towards the Kibor Pass,

00:57:32.390 --> 00:57:34.350
and the two mountains
coming and meeting.

00:57:34.350 --> 00:57:37.360
And what a picture it is
I've taken in my second book

00:57:37.360 --> 00:57:39.660
of showing the mountains
coming down.

00:57:39.660 --> 00:57:42.320
For one thousand years the
[inaudible] had come there

00:57:42.320 --> 00:57:43.620
into the subcontinent.

00:57:43.620 --> 00:57:48.450
And when this fort was made
in 50 days, thereafter,

00:57:48.450 --> 00:57:50.310
the history has not
had any invasion.

00:57:50.310 --> 00:57:52.440
Because of this fort, or
because of other reasons --

00:57:52.440 --> 00:57:53.740
there could be many
other factors,

00:57:53.740 --> 00:57:57.170
but history does also
points that after this fort,

00:57:57.170 --> 00:58:00.780
construction at the Kibor there
has been no further envision.

00:58:00.780 --> 00:58:03.770
As I walked up to this
site of the bastion,

00:58:03.770 --> 00:58:06.680
the room where [inaudible]
body was kept

00:58:06.680 --> 00:58:11.690
after he died battling the
Afghan envision into Punjab,

00:58:11.690 --> 00:58:14.380
for three days he was
kept in this room.

00:58:14.380 --> 00:58:18.990
On the other side yet in
Urdu is written the incident

00:58:18.990 --> 00:58:20.290
which led to his death.

00:58:20.290 --> 00:58:21.590
And when I was growing up,

00:58:21.590 --> 00:58:25.140
I looked at this room falling
apart, I requested the commander

00:58:25.140 --> 00:58:29.270
in the fort that, "Please,
don't let this room go away."

00:58:29.270 --> 00:58:33.180
We don't know what happens with
the history going forward or --

00:58:33.180 --> 00:58:34.900
sorry, not with the
history, with the boundaries,

00:58:34.900 --> 00:58:37.360
or with the passport
regimes, or regional regimes,

00:58:37.360 --> 00:58:40.080
we don't know what the
future has in store for us.

00:58:40.080 --> 00:58:45.590
But if this room falls apart,
the sentiments associated

00:58:45.590 --> 00:58:48.520
with the Sikhs for this
one room are so large,

00:58:48.520 --> 00:58:50.970
but tomorrow the tourism
potential for Pakistan is

00:58:50.970 --> 00:58:55.640
so strong inside this that
this can become the next wave

00:58:55.640 --> 00:58:58.510
to begin the Sikhs to show them
their heritage in Pakistan.

00:58:58.510 --> 00:58:59.810
So don't let this go.

00:58:59.810 --> 00:59:02.070
I was promised by the
commander that they will look

00:59:02.070 --> 00:59:06.710
into actually getting this room
restored, but I hope they do.

00:59:06.710 --> 00:59:11.900
As I looked at this in
[inaudible], this Gurdwara,

00:59:11.900 --> 00:59:14.100
I was reminded -- I
was taken [inaudible]

00:59:14.100 --> 00:59:17.170
of the 92-year-old Baba
inside the village in Kashmir,

00:59:17.170 --> 00:59:23.380
who tells me a beautiful story.

00:59:23.380 --> 00:59:25.930
He -- as I -- not -- I
mean, he told not a story,

00:59:25.930 --> 00:59:27.230
but beautiful experiences.

00:59:27.230 --> 00:59:28.680
As I sat with him, I
was having a cup of tea,

00:59:28.680 --> 00:59:31.490
92-year-old man speaking
very softly

00:59:31.490 --> 00:59:34.440
and he started reciting
the first two verses

00:59:34.440 --> 00:59:38.580
of the [inaudible]
composition of [inaudible]

00:59:38.580 --> 00:59:39.880
and he goes, "[Foreign
language]."

00:59:39.880 --> 00:59:44.900
And I looked at him, I said,
"Baba, how do you know this?"

00:59:44.900 --> 00:59:47.660
He says, "Sultan Singh
[phonetic] was a great man.

00:59:47.660 --> 00:59:50.410
The man who led this Gurdwara
and established mane," he said,

00:59:50.410 --> 00:59:52.690
"There should be a
Khalsa school next to it."

00:59:52.690 --> 00:59:55.120
And I tell you in Pakistan
I've been to many schools,

00:59:55.120 --> 00:59:57.240
the government schools, the
Islamia [phonetic] schools,

00:59:57.240 --> 01:00:00.130
and it has made me
reflect that the Sikhs

01:00:00.130 --> 01:00:04.690
in leading the lands gave
up billions of dollars

01:00:04.690 --> 01:00:06.830
of educational investments.

01:00:06.830 --> 01:00:10.400
Because what the Baba had said
is what many people have told me

01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:13.530
of the olden age, he
says, "We used to aspire

01:00:13.530 --> 01:00:15.710
to go to Khalsa schools."

01:00:15.710 --> 01:00:17.890
The Khalsa schools
had a brand name,

01:00:17.890 --> 01:00:20.370
and Sikhs have invested a
lot of investments at that,

01:00:20.370 --> 01:00:22.220
and therefore if you go into
many of these government schools

01:00:22.220 --> 01:00:23.850
and Islamia schools,
and you will find --

01:00:23.850 --> 01:00:25.150
and I've shown many of them,
[foreign language] something

01:00:25.150 --> 01:00:26.450
in [foreign language]
inside them.

01:00:26.450 --> 01:00:30.460
You don't have to look for them,
because in seven decades a lot

01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:31.760
of it is finished now.

01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:34.970
But it made reflect what
kind of investment we had

01:00:34.970 --> 01:00:37.860
to walk away from,
because going into India,

01:00:37.860 --> 01:00:40.980
the Sikh community has tried
to reestablish the Khalsa brand

01:00:40.980 --> 01:00:42.280
of schools and colleges.

01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:44.540
We have done it.

01:00:44.540 --> 01:00:46.870
But I ask myself this
question, "Did I choose

01:00:46.870 --> 01:00:48.730
to join the Khalsa College?"

01:00:48.730 --> 01:00:51.580
When I got admission there in
Delhi, I chose to decline it

01:00:51.580 --> 01:00:54.040
because the reputation
is not too great.

01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:57.720
Sometimes when your umbilical
cord is severed from ages

01:00:57.720 --> 01:01:00.890
of investments that you
made to build a brand,

01:01:00.890 --> 01:01:04.130
and you are severed from it,
you may not be able to create

01:01:04.130 --> 01:01:05.800
that impression once again.

01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:08.030
And that's the thing
I experienced.

01:01:08.030 --> 01:01:10.320
But he tells me that,
"We used to inspire to go

01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:11.620
to the Khalsa school."

01:01:11.620 --> 01:01:13.540
And he says, "I studied there."

01:01:13.540 --> 01:01:16.650
And he says, "I used to a
lot of time in the Gurdwara."

01:01:16.650 --> 01:01:19.450
And then he said a very
interesting statement,

01:01:19.450 --> 01:01:25.890
which made me reflect, Punjab
was destined to be divided

01:01:25.890 --> 01:01:27.670
because of our own fault.

01:01:27.670 --> 01:01:29.830
There's a lot of
positivity in these lands,

01:01:29.830 --> 01:01:32.460
because faiths had
lived together for ages,

01:01:32.460 --> 01:01:34.790
and we used to live
together for centuries.

01:01:34.790 --> 01:01:36.980
But he made a very
interesting statement,

01:01:36.980 --> 01:01:38.280
which made me reflect.

01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:40.330
What he said was, "We used to --

01:01:40.330 --> 01:01:42.770
" Sultan Singh was a very
great man because the longer --

01:01:42.770 --> 01:01:46.460
the tradition of community
kitchen used offer free food

01:01:46.460 --> 01:01:51.520
to everyone 365 days
a year 24 hours.

01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:54.270
And then he makes a comment,
he says, "We used to pick

01:01:54.270 --> 01:01:56.110
up sucalangar [phonetic]."

01:01:56.110 --> 01:01:58.650
"Sucalangar" means
"dry rations".

01:01:58.650 --> 01:02:01.780
I know the reason why he said
that; I just probed him further.

01:02:01.780 --> 01:02:04.720
I said, "If the food
was being made, Baba,

01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:07.160
why would you pick
up dried rations?

01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:09.040
Just pick up the
food and eat it."

01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:12.920
And he smiles at me
and he says in Punjabi,

01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:14.290
he says, "[Foreign language]."

01:02:14.290 --> 01:02:15.980
He says, "You know the antics

01:02:15.980 --> 01:02:19.210
of the religion,
what it makes us do."

01:02:19.210 --> 01:02:25.050
Basically, what he was alluding
to was on the Lahore station,

01:02:25.050 --> 01:02:28.380
there should be two parts
of water as documented,

01:02:28.380 --> 01:02:31.650
one part used to be for Hindu,
and the other for Muslims.

01:02:31.650 --> 01:02:37.370
And the water used to be
filled from the same tap.

01:02:37.370 --> 01:02:40.390
What it means is that if you
can't drink from the same part,

01:02:40.390 --> 01:02:43.690
if you can't eat from
the same utensils,

01:02:43.690 --> 01:02:45.830
Punjab had a hairline fracture.

01:02:45.830 --> 01:02:49.020
In spite of all the
positiveness,

01:02:49.020 --> 01:02:54.060
there was a hairline fracture,
which was used to the advantage

01:02:54.060 --> 01:02:56.610
of the British when they
were dealing and was creating

01:02:56.610 --> 01:02:59.410
into a communal mindset.

01:02:59.410 --> 01:03:02.170
And because of political
motives and the reasons --

01:03:02.170 --> 01:03:05.550
other political reasons
it had led to a separation

01:03:05.550 --> 01:03:08.050
and severance of
centuries of civilizations

01:03:08.050 --> 01:03:11.280
that have learned
to exist together.

01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:14.300
But as I was leaving,
he said a very, very --

01:03:14.300 --> 01:03:18.470
very, very heart-touching
thing to me.

01:03:18.470 --> 01:03:21.280
He says, "Will you
go back to India?"

01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:22.580
And I said, "Sometimes, yes,

01:03:22.580 --> 01:03:24.630
I stay in Singapore I
sometimes yes will."

01:03:24.630 --> 01:03:27.150
And he says, "Can you
do a favor for me?"

01:03:27.150 --> 01:03:28.450
And I said, "Tell me."

01:03:28.450 --> 01:03:32.100
He says, "Can you go and appeal
to the people, the Hindus

01:03:32.100 --> 01:03:35.100
and Sikhs of Alibage [phonetic],
if they are there anywhere

01:03:35.100 --> 01:03:37.650
in India, that they
must come back now?"

01:03:37.650 --> 01:03:42.590
In his saying that he had
reflected a huge amount

01:03:42.590 --> 01:03:46.410
of emotion, because
what he wanted to do was

01:03:46.410 --> 01:03:47.710
to bring about a closure.

01:03:47.710 --> 01:03:50.680
And I looked at him and I said,
"Baba, how is this possible?

01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:54.130
The countries, and the nations,
and the politics have divided us

01:03:54.130 --> 01:03:56.570
so deeply that there's
no return on this."

01:03:56.570 --> 01:03:58.030
He says, "I understand.

01:03:58.030 --> 01:04:01.530
But if you can convey my
message, I am about to die.

01:04:01.530 --> 01:04:04.040
But I would like to see the
people with whom I grew,

01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:06.260
and I will return -- I
know where the lands were,

01:04:06.260 --> 01:04:07.980
and I will return
that land to them."

01:04:07.980 --> 01:04:11.120
I just smiled and walked away
because it's not possible now.

01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:13.390
But the emotion of
that man said a lot.

01:04:13.390 --> 01:04:18.380
I went up to Baltistan -- I want
to make a small point out here,

01:04:18.380 --> 01:04:22.280
the remains of the Gurdwara
in Baltistan, in Skardu,

01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:26.280
and the fort, which was
taken and made a part

01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:29.890
of the Lahore Darbar [phonetic],
the two battalions in 1840,

01:04:29.890 --> 01:04:31.750
which went from Lahore were led

01:04:31.750 --> 01:04:35.090
into Zorawar Singh
and Mohiud-din-Shah.

01:04:35.090 --> 01:04:36.390
And the person whom they fought

01:04:36.390 --> 01:04:37.710
out here was Amit
Shah [phonetic].

01:04:37.710 --> 01:04:40.590
The point I'm trying to make out
of these names is the following.

01:04:40.590 --> 01:04:43.620
These were not wars
based on religion.

01:04:43.620 --> 01:04:45.340
People just get it wrong.

01:04:45.340 --> 01:04:48.830
I have done an article about
Zorawar Singh 30 years in search

01:04:48.830 --> 01:04:51.220
of Zorawar Singh, because
I've traveled strangely

01:04:51.220 --> 01:04:54.390
and unknowingly deep into Tibet
and other areas of Ladakh,

01:04:54.390 --> 01:04:57.500
and in Pakistan where Zorawar
Singh actually laid a footprint,

01:04:57.500 --> 01:04:58.810
right?

01:04:58.810 --> 01:05:02.420
He was an employee
of the Darbar.

01:05:02.420 --> 01:05:07.360
And when I wrote an article
about him, people turned around

01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:11.900
and said, "Was -- " starting
a tug-of-war on the Internet.

01:05:11.900 --> 01:05:15.230
And the question is whether
Zorawar Singh was a Hindu,

01:05:15.230 --> 01:05:17.000
or a Sikh.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.880
And I'm looking at
this tug-of-war --

01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:22.980
basically it's tugs-of-war,
because when I am a Sikh working

01:05:22.980 --> 01:05:24.660
for American Express,

01:05:24.660 --> 01:05:28.340
the leadership never asked
me what my faith was.

01:05:28.340 --> 01:05:29.820
They paid me for my loyalty

01:05:29.820 --> 01:05:31.900
to the American Express
Organization.

01:05:31.900 --> 01:05:35.130
And the organization here
was the Lahore Darbar.

01:05:35.130 --> 01:05:38.060
And in respect to the fact that
Mohiud-din-Shah was a Muslim,

01:05:38.060 --> 01:05:39.880
Zorawar Singh was a --

01:05:39.880 --> 01:05:43.820
was probably a Hindu or
Sikh, who knows his faith.

01:05:43.820 --> 01:05:45.880
And [inaudible] was a Sikh.

01:05:45.880 --> 01:05:48.620
They were all giving their
loyalty to the kingdom,

01:05:48.620 --> 01:05:51.100
and not based on their faith.

01:05:51.100 --> 01:05:54.430
And yet, these two people who
went inside with the battalions,

01:05:54.430 --> 01:05:56.080
Mohiud-din-Shah leading
one battalion,

01:05:56.080 --> 01:05:57.610
and Zorawar Singh
leading one battalion,

01:05:57.610 --> 01:06:00.560
fighting against the Amit Shah
should be a reflection to show

01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:02.830
that this was not a time

01:06:02.830 --> 01:06:06.450
where the Punjabis were
fighting on religion.

01:06:06.450 --> 01:06:08.910
Because a Muslim could stand on
the other side and be fighting

01:06:08.910 --> 01:06:12.020
against another Muslim, because
they were loyal to a territory,

01:06:12.020 --> 01:06:13.340
and not because of religions.

01:06:13.340 --> 01:06:14.820
That's the point I
want to make out there.

01:06:14.820 --> 01:06:17.900
And I think this
Baltistan, the documentation

01:06:17.900 --> 01:06:20.620
that I've given inside this
book, interesting there.

01:06:20.620 --> 01:06:23.380
I find a very -- I went to
the ministry corporation

01:06:23.380 --> 01:06:26.280
and I was showing some documents
there that after this expedition

01:06:26.280 --> 01:06:30.240
of 1840 all the lands of Skardu
were turned into the title-ship

01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:34.250
under Lahore Darbar of
Khalsa Sarkar [phonetic],

01:06:34.250 --> 01:06:36.040
the government of Khalsa.

01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:41.830
And today, yet, when you take
a lease title inside Skardu,

01:06:41.830 --> 01:06:44.800
the original title-ship
of that land is held

01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:47.570
by Khalsa Sarkar;
in the documents.

01:06:47.570 --> 01:06:49.160
And I've shown the
picture of that.

01:06:49.160 --> 01:06:54.640
What I want to share here
is the beloveds of Nanak,

01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:57.480
what the people have forgotten.

01:06:57.480 --> 01:07:01.880
And what Pakistan
themselves does not know is

01:07:01.880 --> 01:07:05.690
that there are one million
people in Sindh, in Balochistan,

01:07:05.690 --> 01:07:09.900
and in certain areas of Swat,
Mardan, and other places,

01:07:09.900 --> 01:07:13.190
who are believers of Guru Nanak.

01:07:13.190 --> 01:07:18.310
Loosely, they're all called
by everyone as "Hindus".

01:07:18.310 --> 01:07:20.600
But ask them who they are.

01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:24.170
They are opening more and
more Gurdwaras in the format

01:07:24.170 --> 01:07:26.270
that the Sikhs of
Punjab worship in.

01:07:26.270 --> 01:07:30.100
Similar kind of Gurdwaras, 200
of them I've seen actually --

01:07:30.100 --> 01:07:33.050
I've not documented all of them,
but about 200-plus Gurdwaras

01:07:33.050 --> 01:07:35.160
in Sindh and Balochistan
had been opened up.

01:07:35.160 --> 01:07:38.980
These are the communities
that are forgotten.

01:07:38.980 --> 01:07:40.480
If you look at the
[inaudible], the writings

01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:41.780
of Gurnarniks verses [phonetic],

01:07:41.780 --> 01:07:43.260
and the ladies were
sitting out here.

01:07:43.260 --> 01:07:46.460
They look very least
like the Punjabi ladies

01:07:46.460 --> 01:07:47.760
or the Sikh ladies.

01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:49.060
But yet, their faiths are all

01:07:49.060 --> 01:07:51.040
about Gurnarnik and
their attachment.

01:07:51.040 --> 01:07:55.080
This community of Nanak
Panthis needs to be studied,

01:07:55.080 --> 01:07:58.410
needs to be brought to the
limelight, because in India

01:07:58.410 --> 01:08:01.360
after the Partition, this
community has amalgamated

01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:04.610
into the broader faiths of
the land, and moved away

01:08:04.610 --> 01:08:06.870
from the association of Nanak.

01:08:06.870 --> 01:08:08.870
Is it because of we
have not held them,

01:08:08.870 --> 01:08:11.340
or have they been
loosely bounded

01:08:11.340 --> 01:08:13.260
into a religious boundary

01:08:13.260 --> 01:08:15.570
that they have found
the ways to merge?

01:08:15.570 --> 01:08:20.090
But yet in Pakistan, one million
such people are still existing.

01:08:20.090 --> 01:08:22.230
I have actually --
I say it openly

01:08:22.230 --> 01:08:24.400
that maybe the Pakistan
government should ask the

01:08:24.400 --> 01:08:28.240
Sindhis and the Balochis
what is their faith?

01:08:28.240 --> 01:08:32.310
Maybe an open-ended question
will tell us what do they

01:08:32.310 --> 01:08:33.610
feel like.

01:08:33.610 --> 01:08:34.910
Because when I'm
talking to them,

01:08:34.910 --> 01:08:38.880
they are telling me
something very different.

01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:41.760
I asked [inaudible], who is
the head priest of a Gurdwara,

01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:43.060
they don't want to
have any temples.

01:08:43.060 --> 01:08:45.320
They believe in the grand
side, the same practices

01:08:45.320 --> 01:08:46.690
as the Sikh community.

01:08:46.690 --> 01:08:50.100
They may not look like us in
terms of our turban and beard,

01:08:50.100 --> 01:08:52.010
but they believe in all
the elements of the faith.

01:08:52.010 --> 01:08:54.420
They have not graduated to
the tradition of Khalsa,

01:08:54.420 --> 01:08:56.630
but yet they believe in all
the elements of the faith.

01:08:56.630 --> 01:08:59.140
And I asked Banasree Lalgi
[phonetic] a question

01:08:59.140 --> 01:09:01.330
for which he gave me
very interesting answer.

01:09:01.330 --> 01:09:02.780
I asked him at the Langa
[phonetic], I said,

01:09:02.780 --> 01:09:06.640
"Banasree Lalgi, "Can you
tell me how many Hindus

01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:09.450
in Pakistan are believers
of Guru Nanak?"

01:09:09.450 --> 01:09:12.870
And he looks at me and he says,
"Amardeep, it's so unfortunate

01:09:12.870 --> 01:09:14.900
that you still don't
consider us as Sikhs."

01:09:14.900 --> 01:09:18.130
So I say to the Pakistan
government,

01:09:18.130 --> 01:09:20.920
"Let's ask them what they are."

01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:23.890
Because what Pakistan claims

01:09:23.890 --> 01:09:26.660
that there are 14,000
turban-wearing Sikhs is the

01:09:26.660 --> 01:09:28.500
definition that the
world sees them as.

01:09:28.500 --> 01:09:34.450
I see there could be a one
million number sitting there.

01:09:34.450 --> 01:09:37.150
And the game could
change in Pakistan

01:09:37.150 --> 01:09:40.630
about what the Sikh faith is
going through around the world.

01:09:40.630 --> 01:09:42.000
And I think they
should start from there.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.770
Therefore, I believe the next
phase of studies need to be done

01:09:44.770 --> 01:09:47.040
about these forgotten
Nanak Panthis communities

01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:50.740
in Afghanistan, in Pakistan, and
how they've evolved in India,

01:09:50.740 --> 01:09:53.060
because there's a huge story out
here to be told to the world.

01:09:53.060 --> 01:09:56.620
I went to Quetta in Balochistan.

01:09:56.620 --> 01:09:59.210
I want to show you this
group of Nanak Panthis.

01:09:59.210 --> 01:10:02.050
In the Gurdwara they have two
[inaudible] lying out here.

01:10:02.050 --> 01:10:03.970
And all of them or none
of them they want their --

01:10:03.970 --> 01:10:06.340
all have their heads covered
in the Sikh tradition.

01:10:06.340 --> 01:10:08.900
But there's only one
turban-wearing Sikh out there.

01:10:08.900 --> 01:10:11.180
They're all people without
Singh and [inaudible]

01:10:11.180 --> 01:10:13.280
as their last names,
and the [inaudible]

01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:15.090
that they have there are
two of them, one of them is

01:10:15.090 --> 01:10:16.840
in Gurmukhi, and one is in Urdu.

01:10:16.840 --> 01:10:18.910
The Urdu Ghansi [phonetic]
have stopped getting printed

01:10:18.910 --> 01:10:20.210
in India.

01:10:20.210 --> 01:10:21.510
They don't exist anymore.

01:10:21.510 --> 01:10:23.690
In Pakistan, too, they are
not being printed anymore,

01:10:23.690 --> 01:10:25.950
because the last Ghansi in
Urdu that was printed was

01:10:25.950 --> 01:10:28.680
in Hyderabad in somewhere
in mid 1950s.

01:10:28.680 --> 01:10:30.190
The demand suddenly died.

01:10:30.190 --> 01:10:34.240
Some of these far-off places the
communities are still holding

01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:37.480
onto some of the Urdu
script Ghansis, right?

01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:40.670
And when I went to the school
in Quetta, the largest school

01:10:40.670 --> 01:10:42.880
out there called the
"Special School" --

01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:44.880
I thought it was a
special needs school,

01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:46.180
but I was still wondering
whether

01:10:46.180 --> 01:10:49.940
in Pakistan's special
needs is such a big subject

01:10:49.940 --> 01:10:51.240
that you will have
such a big premises

01:10:51.240 --> 01:10:52.820
for just special needs kids.

01:10:52.820 --> 01:10:55.430
I went there; and it was a
Saturday, so I had requested

01:10:55.430 --> 01:10:58.920
to go inside, and the watchman
said that, "Today is Saturday

01:10:58.920 --> 01:11:01.070
and you can't go inside
because the school is closed."

01:11:01.070 --> 01:11:03.890
I had questioned him and I
said, "Can you please call

01:11:03.890 --> 01:11:06.270
up the headmaster
and request him that,

01:11:06.270 --> 01:11:07.950
"A Sikh has come
from Singapore?"

01:11:07.950 --> 01:11:10.740
And he did that and the
headmaster replied and he says,

01:11:10.740 --> 01:11:12.820
"Ask him to wait
there; I'm coming down."

01:11:12.820 --> 01:11:14.120
And in 20 minutes he was there.

01:11:14.120 --> 01:11:15.420
He took me to his office.

01:11:15.420 --> 01:11:17.560
Inside his office, these
black and white pictures

01:11:17.560 --> 01:11:19.930
on the wall -- this is one of
the pictures taken from there.

01:11:19.930 --> 01:11:21.280
This shows the hockey team.

01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:22.610
Sixty percent of the team

01:11:22.610 --> 01:11:26.170
of pre-1947 were
turban-wearing Sikhs.

01:11:26.170 --> 01:11:30.260
In the Indian subcontinents,
Sikhs were known

01:11:30.260 --> 01:11:32.710
as the masters of hockey.

01:11:32.710 --> 01:11:34.840
And today, we've moved so
far away from that sport;

01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:37.470
very few Sikhs who are
playing hockey itself.

01:11:37.470 --> 01:11:39.740
And I am looking at this.

01:11:39.740 --> 01:11:41.480
The Hindu Sikhs Muslims sitting

01:11:41.480 --> 01:11:44.590
in this team, the
names are below.

01:11:44.590 --> 01:11:49.900
And I asked Tokasab [phonetic],
"Tokasab, can you tell me --

01:11:49.900 --> 01:11:52.280
" and he also has got the
picture of the founder

01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:54.920
of the school on the wall.

01:11:54.920 --> 01:11:58.250
And I asked him, "Can you tell
me, why is the school called

01:11:58.250 --> 01:12:00.110
"Special School," you know.

01:12:00.110 --> 01:12:02.270
And his answer is the most
beautiful answer I heard.

01:12:02.270 --> 01:12:06.120
He says, "You know, the Sikhs
made this huge Khalsa school,

01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:10.930
and in 1947 simply left
it here and walked away.

01:12:10.930 --> 01:12:12.880
Isn't it such a beautiful
special act

01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:14.750
that they gave it
to us as a gift?"

01:12:14.750 --> 01:12:17.560
I didn't have anything to say.

01:12:17.560 --> 01:12:22.050
I said, "Sir, you
are the man of hearts

01:12:22.050 --> 01:12:24.100
out here who's torn
my heart," you know.

01:12:24.100 --> 01:12:25.620
And he had said a lot in that.

01:12:25.620 --> 01:12:28.420
Now, you know, I could go on
and on with these stories,

01:12:28.420 --> 01:12:30.630
but I'm sure you'll read the
book, you'll find these stories.

01:12:30.630 --> 01:12:31.980
In the interest of time,

01:12:31.980 --> 01:12:37.460
I want to tell you what
has Amardeep learned

01:12:37.460 --> 01:12:40.300
out of these journeys,
out of these frescoes,

01:12:40.300 --> 01:12:45.820
out of these artworks, which
don't exist in India anymore,

01:12:45.820 --> 01:12:48.990
and do not motivate me to
do these works in India.

01:12:48.990 --> 01:12:52.910
But Pakistan has these
footprints, the communities,

01:12:52.910 --> 01:12:56.140
the artworks, the
frescoes, and I feel an honor

01:12:56.140 --> 01:12:58.790
that the Pakistan government
has permitted me to go inside

01:12:58.790 --> 01:13:01.030
and do these things,
because the story needs

01:13:01.030 --> 01:13:03.190
to be told to the world.

01:13:03.190 --> 01:13:04.980
What was the story of the past,

01:13:04.980 --> 01:13:06.360
and what has Amardeep
taken away?

01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:09.730
This can take hours and
hours, and I can go on.

01:13:09.730 --> 01:13:11.980
You know, I've -- I talk
for two hours in some places

01:13:11.980 --> 01:13:15.070
about the Sikh military legacy
that I mentioned in Pakistan.

01:13:15.070 --> 01:13:17.240
I've talked about the
Nanak Panthis themselves,

01:13:17.240 --> 01:13:18.540
the believers of
Nanak in Pakistan.

01:13:18.540 --> 01:13:19.840
But today, I'm just going

01:13:19.840 --> 01:13:24.260
to give you a stratospheric
view quickly of what is it

01:13:24.260 --> 01:13:26.850
that I've seen from a legacy
perspective in Pakistan.

01:13:26.850 --> 01:13:29.790
And basically, the question
that I get asked many times is,

01:13:29.790 --> 01:13:33.040
"Tell us how many Sikhs
are living in Pakistan."

01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:35.310
Now, I say the long
and the short answer

01:13:35.310 --> 01:13:36.610
of that is the following.

01:13:36.610 --> 01:13:42.540
The short answer is when the
violence of 1947 happened,

01:13:42.540 --> 01:13:45.660
the Muslims got wiped
out from East Punjab.

01:13:45.660 --> 01:13:46.960
As I said from the starting,
"[Foreign language]."

01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:52.640
"All communities
have cried in this."

01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:55.980
And therefore, if I was to
do this work in East Punjab,

01:13:55.980 --> 01:13:59.100
I would say the Muslim story
is the same as our story;

01:13:59.100 --> 01:14:01.140
because they got
wiped out there, too.

01:14:01.140 --> 01:14:03.550
But when I look, my subject
is [inaudible] in Pakistan,

01:14:03.550 --> 01:14:05.520
so therefore I'm
going to look at that.

01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:08.590
So therefore, I've marked
this red section here Punjab

01:14:08.590 --> 01:14:10.460
and Kashmir, the entire Sikh

01:14:10.460 --> 01:14:13.060
and Muslim population
pretty much wiped out.

01:14:13.060 --> 01:14:15.970
As much would happen on
this side of East Punjab.

01:14:15.970 --> 01:14:19.170
But this pocket of close to
Pashabar [phonetic] and close

01:14:19.170 --> 01:14:23.970
to Afghanistan border, the
Sikh community so wiped.

01:14:23.970 --> 01:14:26.790
Sikh community as we define
as [inaudible], and turban,

01:14:26.790 --> 01:14:28.700
and beard, and so
on and so forth,

01:14:28.700 --> 01:14:32.290
all the defined religious
boundaries of the faith,

01:14:32.290 --> 01:14:36.780
the people following that -- the
descendants of that today are 14

01:14:36.780 --> 01:14:38.820
to 15 thousand in number.

01:14:38.820 --> 01:14:41.040
And they are living as
respectable citizens.

01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:42.640
A lot of people ask
me, you know,

01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:45.180
"Are not minorities facing
challenges in Pakistan?"

01:14:45.180 --> 01:14:46.480
You know what I say,

01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:48.790
"Which country do minorities
don't face challenges,

01:14:48.790 --> 01:14:51.900
or which countries does not
have challenges; tell me."

01:14:51.900 --> 01:14:54.660
It exists even in the most
developed nations like US

01:14:54.660 --> 01:14:56.060
and the other places
that exist, right,

01:14:56.060 --> 01:14:57.890
we've got problems everywhere.

01:14:57.890 --> 01:15:00.300
But to say that a community
is being persecuted,

01:15:00.300 --> 01:15:02.360
I think you are just
jumping to conclusion.

01:15:02.360 --> 01:15:05.010
Don't jump to what the
media is trying to tell you.

01:15:05.010 --> 01:15:07.890
Live there and understand
people are surviving,

01:15:07.890 --> 01:15:09.560
people are living.

01:15:09.560 --> 01:15:13.550
1947 was an aberration,
an unfortunate aberration,

01:15:13.550 --> 01:15:16.160
which no one can correct;
you and I cannot correct.

01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:18.670
But to say that everything
is a [inaudible]

01:15:18.670 --> 01:15:20.930
in somewhere is not being fair.

01:15:20.930 --> 01:15:24.400
Right? And therefore, when I
look at this group of people,

01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:29.950
they've moved everywhere in
Pakistan, and they are living

01:15:29.950 --> 01:15:31.730
as respectable citizens.

01:15:31.730 --> 01:15:33.320
There was someone who
said the other day,

01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:35.560
and he was making a wrong
statement, I think in one

01:15:35.560 --> 01:15:38.310
of my forums someone that
said, and I didn't correct them

01:15:38.310 --> 01:15:40.390
because it's not right to
at that point say anything.

01:15:40.390 --> 01:15:43.330
But someone -- people have
a belief that someone saying

01:15:43.330 --> 01:15:45.010
that Nanganaside
[phonetic] is a place

01:15:45.010 --> 01:15:46.310
where the Sikh communities
survive.

01:15:46.310 --> 01:15:50.730
No; Nanganaside is in Punjab
here; and it's a red portion.

01:15:50.730 --> 01:15:52.290
Everyone was wiped out,

01:15:52.290 --> 01:15:54.570
just like Muslims got
wiped out, out here.

01:15:54.570 --> 01:15:57.610
But today, the descendants
of this population

01:15:57.610 --> 01:15:59.780
from here are living
in Nanganaside,

01:15:59.780 --> 01:16:03.440
and there's a very large,
vibrant Sikh community staying

01:16:03.440 --> 01:16:07.010
in Nanganaside, but they
are not Punjabi Sikhs.

01:16:07.010 --> 01:16:10.990
They are Pashtun Sikhs from
this region who speak Pashto

01:16:10.990 --> 01:16:12.910
as their default
language at home.

01:16:12.910 --> 01:16:15.230
The problem with the Sikh
community of Punjab is

01:16:15.230 --> 01:16:19.250
that they always want to equate
Sikhs is equal to Punjabis.

01:16:19.250 --> 01:16:21.610
It is wrong, because Sikhs
are also equal to Kashmirs;

01:16:21.610 --> 01:16:24.200
Sikhs are also equal to
Afghanis; Sikhs are also equal

01:16:24.200 --> 01:16:26.470
to Pashtun people;
Sikhs are also equal

01:16:26.470 --> 01:16:28.020
to Sindhis and Balochis.

01:16:28.020 --> 01:16:32.150
A cultural affiliation has
nothing to do with the religion

01:16:32.150 --> 01:16:34.830
or the belief system of
a person, and therefore,

01:16:34.830 --> 01:16:37.020
all the people that can
tell you, except for one

01:16:37.020 --> 01:16:39.880
or two families whom
I know, all the other

01:16:39.880 --> 01:16:42.770
in Nanganaside today
are the descendants

01:16:42.770 --> 01:16:45.890
of this Pashtun Sikh community.

01:16:49.090 --> 01:16:53.010
But what I want to talk about is
this blue area, back here close

01:16:53.010 --> 01:16:56.590
to Punjab and Kibor,
[inaudible],

01:16:56.590 --> 01:16:59.790
and down here along the River
Indus, 50 kilometers east

01:16:59.790 --> 01:17:03.100
of Indus, right up to
Afghanistan border into Quetta

01:17:03.100 --> 01:17:07.230
and Balochistan is what I
call as the "Nanakpanthis".

01:17:07.230 --> 01:17:08.530
"Panth", for those people

01:17:08.530 --> 01:17:11.950
who do not understand the
Indian terminologies or --

01:17:11.950 --> 01:17:14.180
"panth" is basically
a community, "Nanak",

01:17:14.180 --> 01:17:16.130
the belief -- the
founder of Sikh faith.

01:17:16.130 --> 01:17:18.500
The community that
belongs to Nanak,

01:17:18.500 --> 01:17:23.070
the founder of the Sikh faith
was a very, very large section

01:17:23.070 --> 01:17:26.030
of people, and many of
them lived along the Indus.

01:17:26.030 --> 01:17:28.440
Most of them actually
lived along the Indus belt.

01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:30.740
And this community, the ones

01:17:30.740 --> 01:17:34.440
who do not adopt the Sikh
Khalsa traditions are formed

01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:36.860
of an organized Sikh
traditions are the ones

01:17:36.860 --> 01:17:39.290
who are living along
these pockets.

01:17:39.290 --> 01:17:42.110
And in their minds they
think they are Sikhs.

01:17:42.110 --> 01:17:43.750
Now, in the last 25 years,

01:17:43.750 --> 01:17:45.670
here's what's happening
in Pakistan.

01:17:45.670 --> 01:17:48.770
And I say this openly,
that if there is anyplace

01:17:48.770 --> 01:17:52.220
that Sikhism is on
rise, it's in Pakistan.

01:17:52.220 --> 01:17:55.200
It's a very bold statement
I'm making, but I've seen it.

01:17:55.200 --> 01:17:58.030
It may be in small
numbers, but it is on rise,

01:17:58.030 --> 01:18:02.220
because this community
out here has opened

01:18:02.220 --> 01:18:04.980
over 200 Gurdwaras inside this.

01:18:04.980 --> 01:18:07.270
They are not historical
Gurdwaras,

01:18:07.270 --> 01:18:08.570
but they have been opened.

01:18:08.570 --> 01:18:11.190
This community out here has
no temples, no Hindu temples

01:18:11.190 --> 01:18:13.250
that they go to, but they
only go to Gurdwaras,

01:18:13.250 --> 01:18:14.550
and they believe in [inaudible].

01:18:14.550 --> 01:18:17.950
And therefore, I talk about
[inaudible] discussion.

01:18:17.950 --> 01:18:21.020
It's a community that needs
to be evaluated, studied,

01:18:21.020 --> 01:18:24.120
understood, because this
community has dispersed

01:18:24.120 --> 01:18:26.570
in India and lost its roots.

01:18:26.570 --> 01:18:28.950
They are still surviving
out here.

01:18:28.950 --> 01:18:34.460
One hundred of the community
in Buner, which is lying here,

01:18:34.460 --> 01:18:38.220
in the last 20 years, 100%
of the next generation

01:18:38.220 --> 01:18:40.530
of this community they are
not Singhs and [inaudible],

01:18:40.530 --> 01:18:42.320
they are Lall, Kumper
[phonetic], [inaudible];

01:18:42.320 --> 01:18:49.630
100% of them have embraced the
Sikh form in the last 20 years.

01:18:49.630 --> 01:18:52.360
So this is what the
community's footprint is;

01:18:52.360 --> 01:18:56.130
but 1947 what happened is
the community got dispersed

01:18:56.130 --> 01:18:58.000
into the Gangetic belt.

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.660
Now, civilizations
historically survived

01:19:00.660 --> 01:19:03.540
and thrived along the riverbeds.

01:19:03.540 --> 01:19:05.040
Boundaries never used to exist.

01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:06.700
That's why we have the
Niles civilization,

01:19:06.700 --> 01:19:08.470
or we have the Amazon
civilization,

01:19:08.470 --> 01:19:09.830
we had the Indus civilization,

01:19:09.830 --> 01:19:11.700
we had the Gangetic
civilization.

01:19:11.700 --> 01:19:14.610
The people of the Indus
civilization, we the people

01:19:14.610 --> 01:19:16.810
of the five rivers, the
five rivers which ran

01:19:16.810 --> 01:19:20.380
into the Indus were dispersed
into the Gangetic belt.

01:19:20.380 --> 01:19:22.280
And as the dispersal happens,

01:19:22.280 --> 01:19:24.020
as one of the US-based
studies says,

01:19:24.020 --> 01:19:26.180
"When communities get
dispersed out of force,

01:19:26.180 --> 01:19:27.780
the first generation
becomes quiet,

01:19:27.780 --> 01:19:29.520
the second generation
becomes confused,

01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:31.400
the third generation
remains confused,

01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:33.210
and some of them
start asking questions

01:19:33.210 --> 01:19:34.860
as to what their roots are."

01:19:34.860 --> 01:19:36.230
We are going through that phase.

01:19:36.230 --> 01:19:37.960
It happened with the Jews also.

01:19:37.960 --> 01:19:40.510
It has happened with
every other community.

01:19:40.510 --> 01:19:41.960
If you ask a Syrian
seven decades

01:19:41.960 --> 01:19:43.260
from now what's happening there,

01:19:43.260 --> 01:19:44.560
and as they're getting
displaced,

01:19:44.560 --> 01:19:46.190
it is the same answer
you will get.

01:19:46.190 --> 01:19:48.430
And therefore, we,
as we landed here,

01:19:48.430 --> 01:19:50.020
why do you think ten
million or one-third

01:19:50.020 --> 01:19:52.210
of nearly Sikh communities
moving out --

01:19:52.210 --> 01:19:53.690
living outside of India?

01:19:53.690 --> 01:19:56.470
It's probably this was
a stop gap arrangement,

01:19:56.470 --> 01:19:59.140
because we had lost our roots,
and now it doesn't matter,

01:19:59.140 --> 01:20:00.910
the world is our roots.

01:20:00.910 --> 01:20:03.040
And we're going to
make roots everywhere.

01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:05.780
So we are descendants of a
displaced community who have not

01:20:05.780 --> 01:20:10.200
yet found our roots firmly,
and yet we are planting.

01:20:10.200 --> 01:20:12.600
But as an outcome of
that, the impact has been

01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:15.560
on our philosophy, our culture,
our language, and our heritage;

01:20:15.560 --> 01:20:17.450
because we've lost
it from our roots,

01:20:17.450 --> 01:20:18.770
the land where our roots were.

01:20:18.770 --> 01:20:21.530
And I want to briefly talk
a little bit about that.

01:20:21.530 --> 01:20:28.000
Guru Nanak is typically shown in
art forms in across East Punjab,

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:32.160
Sindh, Balochistan, West Punjab,
and Kashmir area, and Kabul,

01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:36.000
as a man sitting under
the big canopy of a tree,

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:39.060
and his Muslim companion,
[inaudible] playing the rabab,

01:20:39.060 --> 01:20:40.930
and his Hindu companion,

01:20:40.930 --> 01:20:42.990
[inaudible], standing
next to him.

01:20:42.990 --> 01:20:47.000
What he's saying is, I talk
to both Hindus and Turkeys."

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.530
He's not saying, "I talk to
both Hindus and Muslims."

01:20:49.530 --> 01:20:50.990
This is a very fine
thing out here.

01:20:50.990 --> 01:20:53.980
In the interest of time, I will
not going to get into depth

01:20:53.980 --> 01:20:57.110
out here, but what I want to
point out is in the [inaudible]

01:20:57.110 --> 01:20:59.360
where this is, the
[inaudible] are saying,

01:20:59.360 --> 01:21:02.260
"Hindu [foreign language]."

01:21:02.260 --> 01:21:04.460
Hindu and Turak [phonetic]
I'm talking to,

01:21:04.460 --> 01:21:05.790
these are two culture.

01:21:05.790 --> 01:21:08.940
Today, Hinduism is
considered to be a religion,

01:21:08.940 --> 01:21:10.240
but the word "Hindu"

01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:12.420
as a religion was not even
existing in the way it does.

01:21:12.420 --> 01:21:15.510
It only started happening
in 1980 onwards

01:21:15.510 --> 01:21:17.660
when the Turuks came to
the industrial world,

01:21:17.660 --> 01:21:19.550
and they looked at a
civilization that lived

01:21:19.550 --> 01:21:22.630
on that side as the
civilization of the Sindhu,

01:21:22.630 --> 01:21:25.480
and they could not say so and
"Si", and they said "Hindu";

01:21:25.480 --> 01:21:26.780
that was a civilization.

01:21:26.780 --> 01:21:29.800
And therefore, [inaudible] says
this properly, "Hindu Turak".

01:21:29.800 --> 01:21:31.110
He's talking about
two civilizations,

01:21:31.110 --> 01:21:33.440
he's not talking
about two faiths.

01:21:33.440 --> 01:21:37.910
Because in the civilization
of the east of Indus,

01:21:37.910 --> 01:21:39.970
the word "sopta"
[phonetic], and the word --

01:21:39.970 --> 01:21:42.870
"the weak", "sopta" in
the Turkic civilization,

01:21:42.870 --> 01:21:44.440
in the Central Asia,
in Afghanistan

01:21:44.440 --> 01:21:46.060
and other places
becomes "hafta".

01:21:46.060 --> 01:21:50.240
"Sir" becomes a "her",
"Sindhu" becomes a "Hindu".

01:21:50.240 --> 01:21:52.830
And therefore, the people
on this side was Turkeys --

01:21:52.830 --> 01:21:54.480
on this side on the
West were Turkeys,

01:21:54.480 --> 01:21:56.750
and this side were
the Sindhu people.

01:21:56.750 --> 01:21:59.150
And therefore, he's talking
about Sindhu and Hindu --

01:21:59.150 --> 01:22:03.080
Sindhu, the Hindu people and the
Turkey, I'm telling both of them

01:22:03.080 --> 01:22:05.700
that humanity is what matters.

01:22:05.700 --> 01:22:08.030
And therefore, all his
pictures were always

01:22:08.030 --> 01:22:09.900
about the three coming together.

01:22:09.900 --> 01:22:14.480
And in Pakistan in most of
the monuments of the Sikh

01:22:14.480 --> 01:22:16.900
and Hindu era --
Sikhs and Hindus --

01:22:16.900 --> 01:22:19.230
now there are Sikhs and
Hindus, you'll find --

01:22:19.230 --> 01:22:20.950
because it was a
Punjabi population;

01:22:20.950 --> 01:22:24.900
you'll find this is
very commonly put there.

01:22:24.900 --> 01:22:28.360
In the Sufi traditions, there
are many Sufis who yet believe

01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:31.190
in Guru Nanak, though they
may be Muslims and Sufis.

01:22:31.190 --> 01:22:33.360
They yet respect Guru Nanak
in the Pakistan tradition.

01:22:33.360 --> 01:22:37.540
And therefore, when I talk
about philosophies divided,

01:22:37.540 --> 01:22:40.230
I make this point,
of the various --

01:22:40.230 --> 01:22:43.040
when I said that a legacy
is reduced to religion,

01:22:43.040 --> 01:22:45.840
this is how philosophies
get divided, because today

01:22:45.840 --> 01:22:48.890
when the Sikhs go to Pakistan
on a religious circuit,

01:22:48.890 --> 01:22:52.280
the Pakistanis themselves do
not see beyond the Nanak side

01:22:52.280 --> 01:22:55.070
and Punjab side, as the
treasurer and the [inaudible]

01:22:55.070 --> 01:22:56.890
of heritage that
lies in Pakistan.

01:22:56.890 --> 01:22:59.080
The Sikhs themselves do not
see beyond the Nanak side,

01:22:59.080 --> 01:23:00.380
Punjab side.

01:23:00.380 --> 01:23:03.210
It's a problem, because
when we go to Pakistan --

01:23:03.210 --> 01:23:06.120
I've asked this question to my
community, "Tell me when you go

01:23:06.120 --> 01:23:09.320
to Lahore how many of you have
gone as south to [inaudible]

01:23:09.320 --> 01:23:11.750
to see Baba Farid's
[phonetic] place?"

01:23:11.750 --> 01:23:15.590
And there's virtually no one
until late has raised his hand.

01:23:15.590 --> 01:23:18.580
In the Sixth Scripture,
Baba Farid, the Sufi sain,

01:23:18.580 --> 01:23:21.240
his writings were given a
place by Guru Nanak himself,

01:23:21.240 --> 01:23:24.770
because he went to [inaudible]
to bring his writings.

01:23:24.770 --> 01:23:27.840
And when we bound the front of
the Scripture, I actually give

01:23:27.840 --> 01:23:31.150
as much of respect to Baba Farid
as I give to Danak [phonetic].

01:23:31.150 --> 01:23:33.730
And if I can go to Guru
Nanak's place in Nanganaside,

01:23:33.730 --> 01:23:36.470
I should also go to
Baba Farid's place.

01:23:36.470 --> 01:23:37.770
But I don't.

01:23:37.770 --> 01:23:40.990
I did, but we as a
community, we don't.

01:23:40.990 --> 01:23:44.140
And we prefer to go to all the
other places like the market,

01:23:44.140 --> 01:23:47.360
shopping, eating, blah,
blah, blah, but we don't want

01:23:47.360 --> 01:23:48.780
to go to these places.

01:23:48.780 --> 01:23:51.150
Sain Mian Mir's place, Guru
Arjan Dev, the fifth guru,

01:23:51.150 --> 01:23:53.460
actually when he was
laying the foundation stone

01:23:53.460 --> 01:23:55.920
of Golden Temple,
what did he do as part

01:23:55.920 --> 01:24:00.100
of a very pluralistic message
he invited the sain from Lahore,

01:24:00.100 --> 01:24:01.830
"Sain Mian, you need
to come to [inaudible]

01:24:01.830 --> 01:24:04.860
and lay the first foundation
stone of the Golden Temple

01:24:04.860 --> 01:24:08.650
of [inaudible]," which is
the Mecca Medina of Sikhs.

01:24:08.650 --> 01:24:12.880
And yet, I ask this question,
"How many of the Sikhs who go

01:24:12.880 --> 01:24:15.980
to Lahore even go to
Sain Mian's place?"

01:24:15.980 --> 01:24:21.130
You may not go there to worship,
we're not asking with worship,

01:24:21.130 --> 01:24:24.270
but as much as I can worship
at my home, I don't need to go

01:24:24.270 --> 01:24:26.180
to [inaudible] to worship,
because there is no place

01:24:26.180 --> 01:24:28.330
for pilgrimage in
the Sikh philosophy.

01:24:28.330 --> 01:24:32.760
But yet, people do go because
of their hearts being attached

01:24:32.760 --> 01:24:34.060
to those places.

01:24:34.060 --> 01:24:36.830
Something reminds them, "By my
going to Baba Farid's place,

01:24:36.830 --> 01:24:40.080
or by my going to Sain Miam's
place, I'm not worshiping there,

01:24:40.080 --> 01:24:42.950
something attaches and
reminds me of the value systems

01:24:42.950 --> 01:24:45.820
of what my forefathers
used to strive for."

01:24:45.820 --> 01:24:48.900
And therefore, how many
of Muslims are going

01:24:48.900 --> 01:24:51.810
to Guru Nanak's place,
a tradition of Punjabis,

01:24:51.810 --> 01:24:56.700
where we used to coexist amongst
each other, today are divided.

01:24:56.700 --> 01:25:02.350
And it has been many times at
[inaudible] Gurdwara in Lahore,

01:25:02.350 --> 01:25:03.760
where Guru [inaudible]
was martyred,

01:25:03.760 --> 01:25:07.860
when the security people asked
my friend, a Muslim friend,

01:25:07.860 --> 01:25:10.720
to show his identity card, and
stopped him from going inside

01:25:10.720 --> 01:25:14.840
because he's a believer of
Muslim faith, it pains me.

01:25:14.840 --> 01:25:16.300
And I've asked him
so many times,

01:25:16.300 --> 01:25:18.120
"Why would you stop
him to go inside?"

01:25:18.120 --> 01:25:19.600
He says, "It's for
your security, sir."

01:25:19.600 --> 01:25:22.560
And I say, "You know what, if
you have to give my security,

01:25:22.560 --> 01:25:25.590
put three layers of security
out here, check them,

01:25:25.590 --> 01:25:27.140
but don't stop them
from going inside

01:25:27.140 --> 01:25:28.570
because he create barriers.

01:25:28.570 --> 01:25:31.750
How do we come together
as people?"

01:25:31.750 --> 01:25:33.050
So that's what has happened

01:25:33.050 --> 01:25:36.190
as our philosophies
have gotten divided.

01:25:36.190 --> 01:25:38.560
I want to talk about
some frescoes.

01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:43.650
Punjabis respected Guru Nanak.

01:25:43.650 --> 01:25:45.670
And therefore, I -- in
comparative understanding

01:25:45.670 --> 01:25:48.460
of religions, one has to
now go into the other faiths

01:25:48.460 --> 01:25:50.870
to understand, "How did
they view my faith?"

01:25:50.870 --> 01:25:52.550
But when I ran into a lot

01:25:52.550 --> 01:25:54.280
of these frescoes
inside the temples,

01:25:54.280 --> 01:25:56.320
which have also been
equally lying abandoned,

01:25:56.320 --> 01:25:58.520
most of the temples
you'll find these frescoes

01:25:58.520 --> 01:26:00.310
or the Sikh gurus, the
Guru Nanak is sitting

01:26:00.310 --> 01:26:04.150
and the nine Sikh gurus along
with him, and [inaudible].

01:26:04.150 --> 01:26:09.750
Now, whatever did the other
items and other things inside,

01:26:09.750 --> 01:26:11.310
the point I'm trying
to simply reflect

01:26:11.310 --> 01:26:13.020
out here is the believers

01:26:13.020 --> 01:26:16.260
of that faith equally
respected the Sikh tradition.

01:26:16.260 --> 01:26:22.030
And this has gotten fragmented,
this has gotten finished off

01:26:22.030 --> 01:26:25.050
in East India; because we
have gotten compartmentalized

01:26:25.050 --> 01:26:26.520
into who we are.

01:26:26.520 --> 01:26:28.150
We don't need to
become the other faith.

01:26:28.150 --> 01:26:30.130
I know organized
religions always have their

01:26:30.130 --> 01:26:31.430
own boundaries.

01:26:31.430 --> 01:26:34.350
But we don't need to
forget that the others

01:26:34.350 --> 01:26:37.980
and your forefathers were
respecting these visionary

01:26:37.980 --> 01:26:45.620
people, whic, because Punjab
went to not one division,

01:26:45.620 --> 01:26:48.650
Punjab has gone through five
divisions, once in the creation

01:26:48.650 --> 01:26:51.020
of 1947 of India and Pakistan.

01:26:51.020 --> 01:26:53.810
Thereafter India itself got
divided into Chandigarh,

01:26:53.810 --> 01:26:56.780
into Himachal, into
Haryana, and into Punjab.

01:26:56.780 --> 01:27:00.700
What we are left with Punjab
is not what our forefathers had

01:27:00.700 --> 01:27:02.920
played in a turf, which
ran from Chandigarh

01:27:02.920 --> 01:27:05.770
and beyond right up to Lakibar.

01:27:05.770 --> 01:27:08.240
That's the land where our
forefathers return together

01:27:08.240 --> 01:27:09.540
across faiths.

01:27:09.540 --> 01:27:10.920
And this is what these
frescoes tell us,

01:27:10.920 --> 01:27:12.500
that people of all
faiths respected the Sikh

01:27:12.500 --> 01:27:14.370
religion also.

01:27:14.370 --> 01:27:16.300
&gt;&gt; Where is this from?

01:27:16.300 --> 01:27:18.590
&gt;&gt; Amardeep Singh:
Oh, this one is

01:27:18.590 --> 01:27:19.890
from [inaudible] is a village.

01:27:19.890 --> 01:27:25.890
But you know what, how
many of these do you want?

01:27:25.890 --> 01:27:32.220
My depository is filled
with such pictures.

01:27:32.220 --> 01:27:33.750
&gt;&gt; Was all that at [inaudible]?

01:27:33.750 --> 01:27:35.050
&gt;&gt; Amardeep Singh: Pardon
me, [foreign language]?

01:27:35.050 --> 01:27:36.350
&gt;&gt; Was all this at [inaudible]?

01:27:36.350 --> 01:27:37.650
&gt;&gt; Amardeep Singh:
Of course, of course;

01:27:37.650 --> 01:27:38.950
there's always [phonetic].

01:27:38.950 --> 01:27:40.250
&gt;&gt; It's symbolic.

01:27:40.250 --> 01:27:42.420
&gt;&gt; Amardeep Singh:
It's symbolic, yes.

01:27:42.420 --> 01:27:47.600
You know, it takes -- it
requires a different mind

01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:50.480
or a different attention to go
into these art forms of that

01:27:50.480 --> 01:27:54.180
and even start looking at these
all the way in the bad shape,

01:27:54.180 --> 01:27:56.050
to understand even
these small things,

01:27:56.050 --> 01:27:57.430
if you're noticing a tree,

01:27:57.430 --> 01:28:00.950
I'm sure you put a more
concentrated vision into this,

01:28:00.950 --> 01:28:03.190
you will find so many things
coming out, as you will see

01:28:03.190 --> 01:28:05.740
in the next one, I'll
tell you what I saw.

01:28:05.740 --> 01:28:07.920
Because you need a
minute observation

01:28:07.920 --> 01:28:09.220
of these things to understand.

01:28:09.220 --> 01:28:11.790
If you just go to give a
peripheral cursory glance,

01:28:11.790 --> 01:28:13.180
you will not understand
most the things.

01:28:13.180 --> 01:28:14.950
So I went into the mausoleum

01:28:14.950 --> 01:28:17.340
of Hazrat Shah Shams
Tabrez of Multan.

01:28:17.340 --> 01:28:21.310
Because the [inaudible] Multan,
Multan was a land of Sufis.

01:28:21.310 --> 01:28:23.430
The Sufis sent him
a bowl of milk,

01:28:23.430 --> 01:28:27.490
symbolizing that this place is
filled with spiritual people;

01:28:27.490 --> 01:28:29.440
there's no place
for anyone else.

01:28:29.440 --> 01:28:31.770
He kept a few jasmine
petals, saying that the milk

01:28:31.770 --> 01:28:35.160
that did not spill;
all can coexist.

01:28:35.160 --> 01:28:36.550
And the milk -- the
bowl was sent back.

01:28:36.550 --> 01:28:39.600
Then after then he came inside
Multan, and he went inside

01:28:39.600 --> 01:28:42.800
to this place of Hazrat Shah
Shams Tabrez, and there is

01:28:42.800 --> 01:28:44.810
to be historical [inaudible] say

01:28:44.810 --> 01:28:46.830
that there should be
Gurdwara close to this.

01:28:46.830 --> 01:28:50.440
Remembering Guru Nanak's visit,
I could not find the remains

01:28:50.440 --> 01:28:53.350
of the Gurdwara, but what
I found was as I entered,

01:28:53.350 --> 01:28:54.940
this Baba was sitting here.

01:28:54.940 --> 01:28:58.370
And he tells me after ages
the Sikh has returned.

01:28:58.370 --> 01:29:03.220
And as I walked inside and
went around on these fresco --

01:29:03.220 --> 01:29:05.330
on these wall paintings
and so on, so forth,

01:29:05.330 --> 01:29:06.630
what you look at it is out here.

01:29:06.630 --> 01:29:08.330
And I've given this
in my first book,

01:29:08.330 --> 01:29:12.570
what you find is names
written in Gurmukhi of Sikhs.

01:29:12.570 --> 01:29:14.970
Now, I came running back
to this Baba, and I said,

01:29:14.970 --> 01:29:17.210
"You said after ages,
the Sikh has come back.

01:29:17.210 --> 01:29:18.850
Who is writing these
Gurmukhi names?"

01:29:18.850 --> 01:29:21.230
Because in Pakistan, no one's
writing Gurmukhi names up here,

01:29:21.230 --> 01:29:23.360
right, and these are very old
Scripture writings, right?

01:29:23.360 --> 01:29:27.380
So he says, "Oh, these
were written before 1947."

01:29:27.380 --> 01:29:33.040
Now, what it means is
because Guru Nanak came here,

01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:34.340
there was a crisscrossing.

01:29:34.340 --> 01:29:37.520
No one is saying that we
are believing in the grave,

01:29:37.520 --> 01:29:39.930
or we are doing this and that;
that [inaudible] theology

01:29:39.930 --> 01:29:41.230
and philosophy aspects.

01:29:41.230 --> 01:29:43.690
But simply as a mark of respect,

01:29:43.690 --> 01:29:47.270
sometimes traditions
remind us of our leaders.

01:29:47.270 --> 01:29:49.690
Why do we follow our
leaders' traditions;

01:29:49.690 --> 01:29:51.050
it's because it reminds us

01:29:51.050 --> 01:29:53.710
of what the message they
were trying to convey.

01:29:53.710 --> 01:29:55.960
Right; and that's what
to me this was reflective

01:29:55.960 --> 01:29:59.070
of that our forefathers had no
barriers to go into this place

01:29:59.070 --> 01:30:01.710
to remember what Nanak
was actually pursuing.

01:30:01.710 --> 01:30:05.470
And therefore, architectural
message, I want to talk

01:30:05.470 --> 01:30:07.060
about the [inaudible]
Gurdwara, there is place

01:30:07.060 --> 01:30:09.920
that can we restore
as a collective fort,

01:30:09.920 --> 01:30:13.370
because the Pakistan government
has moved a lot from the time

01:30:13.370 --> 01:30:16.730
in 1947 when only
Nanganaside was operational,

01:30:16.730 --> 01:30:19.730
to today there are 24 historical
Gurdwaras that are operational.

01:30:19.730 --> 01:30:22.790
Now, I'm not talking about the
200 Gurdwaras of Nanak Panthis

01:30:22.790 --> 01:30:25.240
that are seen in Baluchistan,
who have community Gurdwaras

01:30:25.240 --> 01:30:26.540
of the people who
are living there.

01:30:26.540 --> 01:30:28.140
But I'm talking about
the historical Gurdwaras,

01:30:28.140 --> 01:30:30.580
they've renovated
about 24 of them.

01:30:30.580 --> 01:30:37.210
But are they renovated in the
way history and the heritage --

01:30:37.210 --> 01:30:39.220
not the history, the
heritage should be maintained;

01:30:39.220 --> 01:30:40.740
I think that's where
the a question mark is,

01:30:40.740 --> 01:30:45.040
and I think that's a
problem not just of Pakistan,

01:30:45.040 --> 01:30:48.650
that's a problem of the entire
Punjabi community, I would say.

01:30:48.650 --> 01:30:50.950
Because I've been to the
mausoleum of [inaudible].

01:30:50.950 --> 01:30:54.100
I've been to Varishad's
[phonetic] mausoleum,

01:30:54.100 --> 01:30:57.310
and I find that they have also
been modernized to the last bit.

01:30:57.310 --> 01:30:59.050
The problem is of the culture,

01:30:59.050 --> 01:31:02.040
the people who don't understand
what heritage maintenance is.

01:31:02.040 --> 01:31:05.640
You don't build on the
heritage, you build around it.

01:31:05.640 --> 01:31:07.190
You preserve that grave.

01:31:07.190 --> 01:31:08.490
You build around it.

01:31:08.490 --> 01:31:11.180
You don't build on that
grave a more modern grave.

01:31:11.180 --> 01:31:13.600
Right; I think that's
the problem.

01:31:13.600 --> 01:31:18.560
So most of the Gurdwaras that
our own Sikh people are coming

01:31:18.560 --> 01:31:20.800
in with pot loads of
money to Pakistan,

01:31:20.800 --> 01:31:22.890
the Pakistan actually
[inaudible] has been giving

01:31:22.890 --> 01:31:24.190
out contracts.

01:31:24.190 --> 01:31:26.380
I think the intent is that,
"Oh, we want to help you.

01:31:26.380 --> 01:31:28.410
Please go ahead and maintain."

01:31:28.410 --> 01:31:30.490
But these people are not
qualified to maintain,

01:31:30.490 --> 01:31:33.180
because in East Punjab,
they've destroyed everything.

01:31:33.180 --> 01:31:36.110
And I keep telling after these
two works in my brief discussion

01:31:36.110 --> 01:31:37.880
that I'm having with the Iraqi
Trust Property Board [phonetic]

01:31:37.880 --> 01:31:40.440
in Pakistan so that this
heritage belongs to Pakistan.

01:31:40.440 --> 01:31:43.000
My forefathers left it for you.

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:47.010
As much as they say that this
belongs to them and the people

01:31:47.010 --> 01:31:48.620
from the Sikh community who
were coming in with pot loads

01:31:48.620 --> 01:31:52.080
of money to restore them, it
also belongs to me equally.

01:31:52.080 --> 01:31:53.570
And I'm trying to
tell you [inaudible]

01:31:53.570 --> 01:31:56.520
that don't give the contracts
unless you've got rules

01:31:56.520 --> 01:31:59.980
of engagement, that don't let
this heritage buildings be cut,

01:31:59.980 --> 01:32:02.180
and what do they
do, marble and gold,

01:32:02.180 --> 01:32:03.510
because these are
the last remains

01:32:03.510 --> 01:32:05.210
of Sikh heritage left anywhere

01:32:05.210 --> 01:32:07.510
in the world, and
it's in Pakistan.

01:32:07.510 --> 01:32:09.220
It's your responsibility
to maintain it.

01:32:09.220 --> 01:32:12.090
The question is, "When will
it become our responsibility

01:32:12.090 --> 01:32:13.390
to maintain it?"

01:32:13.390 --> 01:32:15.180
I don't think we can
restore everything.

01:32:15.180 --> 01:32:17.670
The question is, "Can the
Sikh community come together

01:32:17.670 --> 01:32:20.660
across the world to say we
will pick up two or three

01:32:20.660 --> 01:32:22.130
such monuments, and restore them

01:32:22.130 --> 01:32:26.040
in the manner our forefathers
left it, as a last site

01:32:26.040 --> 01:32:30.380
of what our generations ahead
can see that, "Here are the two,

01:32:30.380 --> 01:32:33.730
three monuments we left
for you in the right way."

01:32:33.730 --> 01:32:35.680
Yes; so I think there's
something for us to think.

01:32:35.680 --> 01:32:37.850
I think the Pakistan
government will collaborate.

01:32:37.850 --> 01:32:39.800
But we need to come
to the right plan.

01:32:39.800 --> 01:32:41.340
And this cannot be
done just by Amardeep,

01:32:41.340 --> 01:32:43.820
because I'm a researcher,
I'm a writer, I'm a --

01:32:43.820 --> 01:32:46.320
I'm getting new thought,
new things out to you all.

01:32:46.320 --> 01:32:50.040
The question is, "How do we
rally around it as a cause?"

01:32:50.040 --> 01:32:51.340
Moral depictions;

01:32:51.340 --> 01:32:55.250
these monuments have moral
depictions that go beyond faith.

01:32:55.250 --> 01:32:57.210
And moral depictions
always convey a story.

01:32:57.210 --> 01:32:59.640
In the past -- in the
Gurdwaras [inaudible],

01:32:59.640 --> 01:33:04.200
I've seen depictions of even
things like Shravan Kumar.

01:33:04.200 --> 01:33:06.190
Now, Shravan Kumar may not
look like a Sikh of totally

01:33:06.190 --> 01:33:08.310
like a turban-wearing
and so on, so forth.

01:33:08.310 --> 01:33:11.970
But organized religion
has got its own space,

01:33:11.970 --> 01:33:14.840
but the modern traditions
could cut across faiths.

01:33:14.840 --> 01:33:17.710
Because Shravan Kumar is
a beautiful story of a man

01:33:17.710 --> 01:33:19.010
of the Indian subcontinent.

01:33:19.010 --> 01:33:20.600
The story what is
being said out here is

01:33:20.600 --> 01:33:23.140
that when his parents were
very aged, they wanted to go

01:33:23.140 --> 01:33:26.950
around on a pilgrimage, and he
offered his shoulder to put them

01:33:26.950 --> 01:33:29.480
into a basket and walk
them across the continent

01:33:29.480 --> 01:33:32.320
to actually -- subcontinent
to take them to these places

01:33:32.320 --> 01:33:34.850
of worship, because
he respected them.

01:33:34.850 --> 01:33:38.850
The story is out here of
how to respect your parents.

01:33:38.850 --> 01:33:40.500
It's nothing the religion.

01:33:40.500 --> 01:33:43.180
And these frescoes
actually found a place.

01:33:43.180 --> 01:33:46.080
And therefore, I'm looking
at this monument out here,

01:33:46.080 --> 01:33:48.330
which I talked about,
the Banoliber [phonetic],

01:33:48.330 --> 01:33:50.180
the first copy of
the [inaudible],

01:33:50.180 --> 01:33:52.920
which was written out here.

01:33:52.920 --> 01:33:55.890
The beautiful building from
inside, when I look at it,

01:33:55.890 --> 01:33:59.050
from outside the frescoes have
no restriction of any faith.

01:33:59.050 --> 01:34:01.390
Inside the restrictions
of the faith are

01:34:01.390 --> 01:34:03.940
that it's only the Sikh guru's
frescoes which are made.

01:34:03.940 --> 01:34:06.760
And in the center when the --
where the worship would happen,

01:34:06.760 --> 01:34:10.020
only words are written out
here, words from the Scripture.

01:34:10.020 --> 01:34:13.260
Now, to me the message
is that all are welcome,

01:34:13.260 --> 01:34:15.020
and therefore there's
no restriction of faith,

01:34:15.020 --> 01:34:17.650
and the Sikh gurus are holding
their hand and taking the center

01:34:17.650 --> 01:34:21.140
where only the word matters,
only the message of the Grant,

01:34:21.140 --> 01:34:23.240
which is the word which matters.

01:34:23.240 --> 01:34:25.160
And therefore when I'm looking
at all this, I'm standing

01:34:25.160 --> 01:34:29.250
in the Pakistan side in the
village called "Ganda Singh".

01:34:29.250 --> 01:34:30.550
This is Ganda Singh Wala.

01:34:30.550 --> 01:34:31.850
It's a Sikh name.

01:34:31.850 --> 01:34:33.150
And I'm looking at
the other side,

01:34:33.150 --> 01:34:34.450
the village on the other side

01:34:34.450 --> 01:34:35.750
of the water is Philosport
[phonetic].

01:34:35.750 --> 01:34:37.050
"Philosport" is an Islamic
name, "Philos" [phonetic],

01:34:37.050 --> 01:34:38.350
and here is Ganda Singh.

01:34:38.350 --> 01:34:41.300
The irony is Punjab could
have never been divided.

01:34:41.300 --> 01:34:43.340
And as I'm standing and
looking at the irony

01:34:43.340 --> 01:34:47.950
of the two villages,
Philosport and Ganda Singh,

01:34:47.950 --> 01:34:49.890
a Muslim village on that side
and Ganda Singh out here,

01:34:49.890 --> 01:34:51.190
I've seen so many of them.

01:34:51.190 --> 01:34:53.260
Kilajivan Singh [phonetic]
in Pakistan and [inaudible]

01:34:53.260 --> 01:34:55.340
on the other side in India.

01:34:55.340 --> 01:34:57.360
Right; Islamic name
on that side,

01:34:57.360 --> 01:34:58.660
the Sikh name on this side.

01:34:58.660 --> 01:35:00.470
It reminds me that
for the Punjabis,

01:35:00.470 --> 01:35:03.630
it is felt like the left
their jackets in India

01:35:03.630 --> 01:35:05.380
and their trousers in Pakistan.

01:35:05.380 --> 01:35:08.520
Of course, they can't even
dress up after that, right?

01:35:08.520 --> 01:35:10.250
And therefore, when I
went to Jalan Gurdwara,

01:35:10.250 --> 01:35:14.300
I've looked at these boards
out there, the Gurdwaras,

01:35:14.300 --> 01:35:16.070
and the Gurdwaras
are absolutely empty,

01:35:16.070 --> 01:35:18.320
no service has happened
for seven decades.

01:35:18.320 --> 01:35:22.610
But yet out here it is written
out here, "[Foreign language]."

01:35:22.610 --> 01:35:26.330
The morning prayer of the Sikhs,
which is sung in every temple,

01:35:26.330 --> 01:35:28.290
is yet waiting for
that to happen.

01:35:28.290 --> 01:35:30.660
And therefore, I'm reminded of
the "Sounds of Silence" of Simon

01:35:30.660 --> 01:35:33.610
and Garfunkel, you hear
that "Sound of Silence",

01:35:33.610 --> 01:35:35.800
the song tonight, and
it reminds you of this,

01:35:35.800 --> 01:35:38.520
sometimes the sounds of silence
can be actually deafening,

01:35:38.520 --> 01:35:39.820
because nothing has happened

01:35:39.820 --> 01:35:42.090
in these monuments
for seven decades.

01:35:42.090 --> 01:35:44.400
And yet, the program
says, "When is it going

01:35:44.400 --> 01:35:46.330
to happen; it's waiting as to."

01:35:46.330 --> 01:35:50.660
I want to talk about
the uniqueness

01:35:50.660 --> 01:35:54.040
of recognizing all human race
as one, because when you look

01:35:54.040 --> 01:35:55.340
at the data side
[phonetic] Gurdwara,

01:35:55.340 --> 01:35:59.140
what I found is a beautiful
coming together the plurality

01:35:59.140 --> 01:36:00.890
or the coming together
of the communities.

01:36:00.890 --> 01:36:02.670
A Sikh -- a Pashtuns
Sikh is sitting

01:36:02.670 --> 01:36:04.890
on the [inaudible]
reading the Grant.

01:36:04.890 --> 01:36:09.620
The descendants -- the Muslim
descendants of Baba Nanak --

01:36:09.620 --> 01:36:11.630
[inaudible], the two of
them [inaudible] out here

01:36:11.630 --> 01:36:16.680
and Nanak Banti [phonetic]
sitting out here from Sindh.

01:36:16.680 --> 01:36:20.940
To me, this was an all
inclusiveness message,

01:36:20.940 --> 01:36:24.420
which was plummeted in the Sikh
faith o come together, right?

01:36:24.420 --> 01:36:26.400
But today, it has come too hard

01:36:26.400 --> 01:36:28.590
that maybe these people
will not get accepted by us.

01:36:28.590 --> 01:36:30.330
But in Pakistan,
they are existing.

01:36:30.330 --> 01:36:32.800
And this is the beauty
of the coexistence.

01:36:32.800 --> 01:36:34.910
And therefore, I want to --
in the [inaudible] of time,

01:36:34.910 --> 01:36:36.720
I'm not going to show
the video of this one,

01:36:36.720 --> 01:36:40.920
but this is a Muslim
community of descendants

01:36:40.920 --> 01:36:43.450
of [inaudible] best
friend, who actually are

01:36:43.450 --> 01:36:46.110
yet doing the [inaudible]
inside the data side Gurdwara

01:36:46.110 --> 01:36:48.590
for ten minutes every Sunday.

01:36:48.590 --> 01:36:52.560
And the interesting thing that
they told me is that the irony

01:36:52.560 --> 01:36:54.890
of Partition is such
that my forefathers used

01:36:54.890 --> 01:36:57.220
to do [inaudible] at the
Golden Temple, and [inaudible].

01:36:57.220 --> 01:37:01.110
And when Partition
happened, we moved the site --

01:37:01.110 --> 01:37:04.080
our father moved the site with
the hope that we will go back.

01:37:04.080 --> 01:37:05.440
But the Partition
line was so hard

01:37:05.440 --> 01:37:06.740
that they could never go back.

01:37:06.740 --> 01:37:09.950
And two of the ironies that
we're seeing in these Gurdwaras

01:37:09.950 --> 01:37:11.740
out here, but there's
not a single Sikh

01:37:11.740 --> 01:37:13.470
to hurt us [phonetic].

01:37:13.470 --> 01:37:17.090
I mean, we are seeing the walls
[phonetic] basically out here.

01:37:17.090 --> 01:37:20.080
Culture and art; I want
to show this place,

01:37:20.080 --> 01:37:22.240
which is pretty much
destroyed and finished

01:37:22.240 --> 01:37:23.700
because the communities
are gone.

01:37:23.700 --> 01:37:26.890
This is a place which
was of the Udases.

01:37:26.890 --> 01:37:29.120
The Nanak Bhanti [phonetic]
tradition was very, very big.

01:37:29.120 --> 01:37:32.320
And the Udases tradition, I want
to just make one point out here,

01:37:32.320 --> 01:37:34.790
because I've tried to go into
the places of the others,

01:37:34.790 --> 01:37:37.260
because these don't
exist in India.

01:37:37.260 --> 01:37:41.400
The Udasi tradition places have
all been, again, plastered,

01:37:41.400 --> 01:37:44.350
and whitened, and turned
into glittering places,

01:37:44.350 --> 01:37:46.070
and there's nothing
of past left.

01:37:46.070 --> 01:37:47.970
Now, and Pakistan as
I've gone inside these.

01:37:47.970 --> 01:37:49.820
Although it looks like
a pretty bad state,

01:37:49.820 --> 01:37:51.120
it's in Pakistan's heritage.

01:37:51.120 --> 01:37:54.340
I think the Pakistan government
should maintain this place

01:37:54.340 --> 01:37:56.530
[inaudible] beautiful
frescoes inside it.

01:37:56.530 --> 01:37:59.400
There's a fresco here I found
of what my forefathers --

01:37:59.400 --> 01:38:00.700
today the Western
world is talking

01:38:00.700 --> 01:38:04.940
about women's empowerment,
and way back in 1600s,

01:38:04.940 --> 01:38:07.820
it shows of women going for
hunt, and men were sitting

01:38:07.820 --> 01:38:10.530
and chilling with hawks
sitting in their hands, right?

01:38:10.530 --> 01:38:13.970
So that's a women's empowerment,
which was way, way ahead, right?

01:38:13.970 --> 01:38:18.310
And looking at these frescoes,
all I can take away is 90%

01:38:18.310 --> 01:38:22.760
of these frescoes are about
Sikh traditions, the Sikh gurus,

01:38:22.760 --> 01:38:24.170
the Sikh military traditions,

01:38:24.170 --> 01:38:26.260
the Sikh stories,
and so, so forth.

01:38:26.260 --> 01:38:28.570
And when I look at them, I
say, "You know what, yes,

01:38:28.570 --> 01:38:31.170
the Udasi tradition is not
considered to be a part

01:38:31.170 --> 01:38:34.720
of the Sikh faith today, but
somehow these people felt

01:38:34.720 --> 01:38:37.990
so close to us that they were
drawing only the Sikh traditions

01:38:37.990 --> 01:38:39.290
in their art form.

01:38:39.290 --> 01:38:41.410
Why would someone draw
the Sikh tradition

01:38:41.410 --> 01:38:43.770
if they were not
actually close to us,"

01:38:43.770 --> 01:38:45.070
is the question that I ask.

01:38:45.070 --> 01:38:46.720
I don't have the
answers to these,

01:38:46.720 --> 01:38:48.020
but it's a question I ask.

01:38:48.020 --> 01:38:50.910
They believed in us, that's
why they do it, right?

01:38:50.910 --> 01:38:52.370
And therefore, I'm just
bringing this to an end

01:38:52.370 --> 01:38:54.080
with the last two slides.

01:38:54.080 --> 01:38:57.350
Amongst all these emotions,
as close to the [inaudible],

01:38:57.350 --> 01:39:00.680
dividing India and Pakistan,
I walked into the remains

01:39:00.680 --> 01:39:03.740
of this Gurdwara, made in the
memory of the third Sikh guru.

01:39:03.740 --> 01:39:07.250
Most of it is -- all of it has
fallen off [inaudible] land.

01:39:07.250 --> 01:39:09.800
Only one section
of it is standing,

01:39:09.800 --> 01:39:11.460
and that, too, it's leaning.

01:39:11.460 --> 01:39:14.370
I call it as "The
Leaning Tower of Punjab".

01:39:14.370 --> 01:39:17.000
And as I'm looking at it, I
walked in and I touched it,

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.050
after having photographed it.

01:39:19.050 --> 01:39:22.140
And as I touched
it, it spoke to me.

01:39:22.140 --> 01:39:24.410
And I want to share with
you what it spoke to me;

01:39:24.410 --> 01:39:26.560
because it's very relevant
because it raised a question

01:39:26.560 --> 01:39:29.240
for me afterwards in my mind.

01:39:29.240 --> 01:39:32.760
It says to me, "Welcome back.

01:39:32.760 --> 01:39:34.060
Welcome back.

01:39:34.060 --> 01:39:35.480
Where were you for
seven decades?"

01:39:35.480 --> 01:39:39.850
And I kept hearing it, and
it says, "Where were you

01:39:39.850 --> 01:39:44.750
for seven decades, because when
[inaudible] from Persia came,

01:39:44.750 --> 01:39:49.830
massacred your community,
Amachob Dali [phonetic] came,

01:39:49.830 --> 01:39:52.790
massacred what you call
as the 'First Holocaust'

01:39:52.790 --> 01:39:55.250
and the 'Second Holocaust' in
the Sikh history, what is known

01:39:55.250 --> 01:39:58.250
as 'Pella Kalukala' and
'Second Kalukala' [phonetic].

01:39:58.250 --> 01:40:00.340
Yet you stayed here.

01:40:00.340 --> 01:40:04.090
So what happened in 1947 that
you simply chose to walk away?

01:40:04.090 --> 01:40:06.710
Did you not have a moral
responsibility towards us?"

01:40:06.710 --> 01:40:08.860
Now, this is the
monument that's asking.

01:40:08.860 --> 01:40:10.420
I know the history.

01:40:10.420 --> 01:40:13.250
So a lot of time, people start
getting up and telling me,

01:40:13.250 --> 01:40:14.550
"Why have you walked away."

01:40:14.550 --> 01:40:16.610
I know the history, so let's
not waste time on that, right?

01:40:16.610 --> 01:40:19.080
But the fact is the
monument's emotion which says,

01:40:19.080 --> 01:40:20.930
"Why did you walk away?"

01:40:20.930 --> 01:40:24.920
And as I walked away, I
asked myself this question,

01:40:24.920 --> 01:40:28.690
"Was there a solution where
we could have coexisted

01:40:28.690 --> 01:40:30.630
on both the sides
of the border?"

01:40:30.630 --> 01:40:34.190
I don't know the answer.

01:40:34.190 --> 01:40:37.030
But I know that the
Sikhs were 18%

01:40:37.030 --> 01:40:39.080
of the greater Punjab's
population.

01:40:39.080 --> 01:40:41.080
We were going to be
-- we were a minority,

01:40:41.080 --> 01:40:43.550
we had a kingdom,
we had an empire.

01:40:43.550 --> 01:40:45.130
We were a minority.

01:40:45.130 --> 01:40:47.990
We are still a minority
everywhere in the world,

01:40:47.990 --> 01:40:49.960
and if the nation
was being divided,

01:40:49.960 --> 01:40:51.920
we would have been a
minority on both the sites.

01:40:51.920 --> 01:40:53.470
That wouldn't have changed.

01:40:53.470 --> 01:40:54.820
So could there have
been a solution

01:40:54.820 --> 01:40:56.840
that we could have coexisted
on both sides of the border?

01:40:56.840 --> 01:40:59.550
I don't know the answer, but it
was a very important question

01:40:59.550 --> 01:41:01.070
that I still ponder upon.

01:41:01.070 --> 01:41:02.770
And I want to end
on a positive note,

01:41:02.770 --> 01:41:05.770
because at Vaishali
[phonetic] when I went in,

01:41:05.770 --> 01:41:08.640
this old man saw me, and
he gives me a big hug;

01:41:08.640 --> 01:41:11.050
and this is the human emotion
that you need to anchor on,

01:41:11.050 --> 01:41:14.130
works of monuments, works
of tangible, intangible.

01:41:14.130 --> 01:41:17.270
There's enough to read on it and
the human emotions interspersed.

01:41:17.270 --> 01:41:20.680
But at the end of the day, I
believe in the human values.

01:41:20.680 --> 01:41:23.590
Because as I walked in, he
gives me a big hug and he says

01:41:23.590 --> 01:41:26.450
in Punjabi and I've
translated it,

01:41:26.450 --> 01:41:27.750
and he says, "[Foreign
language]."

01:41:27.750 --> 01:41:31.540
What he's saying is, "By looking
at you today, I'm reminded

01:41:31.540 --> 01:41:32.840
by my childhood friend,
[inaudible],"

01:41:32.840 --> 01:41:35.400
whom he has not met
for seven decades,

01:41:35.400 --> 01:41:36.960
Because the lines divided them.

01:41:36.960 --> 01:41:40.050
And as I was coming out from
of Baba [inaudible] mausoleum,

01:41:40.050 --> 01:41:43.740
the great Sufi poet, who are not
just the Muslims and the Sufis,

01:41:43.740 --> 01:41:46.590
if you are Sikhs, Hindus,
everyone, [inaudible]

01:41:46.590 --> 01:41:50.560
and I was coming out this
man limping on the other side

01:41:50.560 --> 01:41:54.540
of the road says to me,
"[Foreign language]," "Welcome."

01:41:54.540 --> 01:41:56.320
And he comes rushing this side.

01:41:56.320 --> 01:42:00.010
This shop is not his, but
he picks up the petals.

01:42:00.010 --> 01:42:01.980
And in that moment, a friend
of my took this picture.

01:42:01.980 --> 01:42:06.400
And he showers those
petals on me, and he says,

01:42:06.400 --> 01:42:10.170
"If I cut my finger, and if I
cut your finger, does blood flow

01:42:10.170 --> 01:42:13.060
in yours, and does
milk flow in mine?"

01:42:13.060 --> 01:42:16.470
And I want to end here, because
this is about a human story

01:42:16.470 --> 01:42:19.040
and this human story
applies to all communities.

01:42:19.040 --> 01:42:22.740
I have chosen to study it
from a Sikh lens perspective.

01:42:22.740 --> 01:42:24.040
If I'm given a chance to do this

01:42:24.040 --> 01:42:26.280
from any other community's
perspective, Hindu or Muslim,

01:42:26.280 --> 01:42:28.310
I think the story of
Partition will be the same.

01:42:28.310 --> 01:42:29.610
Thank you very much.

01:42:29.610 --> 01:42:30.910
I'm happy to take any questions.

01:42:30.910 --> 01:42:32.670
I know we've got just now
about ten minutes or so,

01:42:32.670 --> 01:42:35.510
so I can take a few
questions if you want.

01:42:35.510 --> 01:42:45.070
[ Applause ]

01:42:45.070 --> 01:42:47.530
So in asking questions,
again, as Jonathan said,

01:42:47.530 --> 01:42:50.420
by request let's not
tell our comments,

01:42:50.420 --> 01:42:52.010
because time is little, okay?

01:42:52.010 --> 01:42:58.850
If there any questions,
I'm happy to take them.

01:42:58.850 --> 01:43:00.150
&gt;&gt; So Amardeep, [inaudible].

01:43:00.150 --> 01:43:01.450
&gt;&gt; Amardeep Singh: So I --

01:43:01.450 --> 01:43:02.750
&gt;&gt; Sorry, can you
please repeat that?

01:43:02.750 --> 01:43:05.300
&gt;&gt; Oh; how many years did
you spend [inaudible]?

01:43:05.300 --> 01:43:07.000
&gt;&gt; Amardeep Singh: So
as I said to you --

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:08.910
maybe you missed it in the
beginning, you came late,

01:43:08.910 --> 01:43:14.180
I went into Pakistan
in 2014 first.

01:43:14.180 --> 01:43:19.100
And by now, it's been three and
a half years that I've spent

01:43:19.100 --> 01:43:22.150
in these two publications, which
are these two text publications.

01:43:22.150 --> 01:43:25.680
Now, these are available and if
you want, you can actually go

01:43:25.680 --> 01:43:28.350
to amazon.com and write for
the books' names or you can go

01:43:28.350 --> 01:43:31.040
to lostheritagebook.com and
order there, or if you go

01:43:31.040 --> 01:43:33.220
to Rajwant, he's sitting
here, and you can tell him --

01:43:33.220 --> 01:43:34.620
he's bringing in some books.

01:43:34.620 --> 01:43:36.950
He can actually arrange to
have it -- give it to you.

01:43:36.950 --> 01:43:38.810
You can meet Rajwant afterwards.

01:43:38.810 --> 01:43:41.940
But to answer to your
question is so these two books

01:43:41.940 --> 01:43:44.100
from the research
to the completion

01:43:44.100 --> 01:43:46.290
for both the books has taken
me three and a half years

01:43:46.290 --> 01:43:50.000
from the time I stepped
into Pakistan in 2014.

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.610
But actually, I tell you that
it's a journey of over 30 years,

01:43:52.610 --> 01:43:54.810
because over 30 years, I did
not know what I was doing;

01:43:54.810 --> 01:43:57.390
I was doing my job and I
was just doing all kinds

01:43:57.390 --> 01:44:00.180
of spirituality studying,
and faith studying,

01:44:00.180 --> 01:44:03.160
history studying, photography,
writing for magazines.

01:44:03.160 --> 01:44:04.580
I think those all
those skills came

01:44:04.580 --> 01:44:07.710
in handy the day my
corporate career ended,

01:44:07.710 --> 01:44:10.590
not knowingly why it was ending,
I was in a confused state,

01:44:10.590 --> 01:44:11.890
but the new door opened.

01:44:11.890 --> 01:44:13.630
And I think that's when
now I can rationalize

01:44:13.630 --> 01:44:16.030
and say actually God was
preparing me for 30 years.

01:44:16.030 --> 01:44:18.140
I think it's a very tough
task to do if you just walk

01:44:18.140 --> 01:44:20.530
into the country today and
think you can replicate this,

01:44:20.530 --> 01:44:21.900
because a lot of
energies over a period

01:44:21.900 --> 01:44:23.870
of time actually come together.

01:44:23.870 --> 01:44:25.170
Yes?

01:44:25.170 --> 01:44:26.470
&gt;&gt; Okay.

01:44:26.470 --> 01:44:27.770
&gt;&gt; Amardeep Singh: Yes.

01:44:27.770 --> 01:44:29.070
&gt;&gt; Because three and a
half years is not enough

01:44:29.070 --> 01:44:30.370
to do what you did.

01:44:30.370 --> 01:44:31.670
You know, so it's -

01:44:31.670 --> 01:44:32.970
&gt;&gt; Amardeep Singh: No, it's not.

01:44:32.970 --> 01:44:34.270
I'm running at a
[inaudible] pace.

01:44:34.270 --> 01:44:35.570
I only know it's taking a
toll on body, on my mind.

01:44:35.570 --> 01:44:36.870
I'm hitting a roadblock.

01:44:36.870 --> 01:44:38.170
There's a lot of
challenges around.

01:44:38.170 --> 01:44:39.470
Each book is six
years' PhD work.

01:44:39.470 --> 01:44:40.810
It can -- in an academic
environment,

01:44:40.810 --> 01:44:42.620
it takes 12 years to
13 years to do it.

01:44:42.620 --> 01:44:45.010
But yet, we got it from three
to three and a half years.

01:44:45.010 --> 01:44:46.400
Yes.

01:44:46.400 --> 01:44:47.820
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible]; I'm
really touched [inaudible],

01:44:47.820 --> 01:44:53.900
then I'm going to
ask you a question.

01:44:53.900 --> 01:44:58.670
[Foreign language] and he said,
"How long you have been here?"

01:44:58.670 --> 01:44:59.970
[Inaudible].

01:44:59.970 --> 01:45:01.630
So I said, "How about you?"

01:45:01.630 --> 01:45:06.440
He said, "I just came here."

01:45:06.440 --> 01:45:18.260
I said, "And welcome
to the United States."

01:45:18.260 --> 01:45:27.050
So he was talking Punjabi,
and I could figure out,

01:45:27.050 --> 01:45:30.590
because I'm from Pakistan.

01:45:30.590 --> 01:45:34.620
I said, "You are
touched me, you know,

01:45:34.620 --> 01:45:40.380
he said that about ten years
back I met a young lady,

01:45:40.380 --> 01:45:47.550
who was left as a orphan,
you know, in Pakistan.

01:45:47.550 --> 01:45:50.290
Actually, her mother
was left [inaudible].

01:45:50.290 --> 01:45:56.440
And the reason I
[inaudible], "That's wonderful."

01:45:56.440 --> 01:45:58.670
And then he showed
me his [inaudible].

01:45:58.670 --> 01:46:03.060
And I said, "Oh, that's
wonderful," you know.

01:46:03.060 --> 01:46:05.930
He said, "I'm half Sikh."

01:46:07.230 --> 01:46:10.880
Well, I asked him, you
know, "Very impressed."

01:46:10.880 --> 01:46:16.950
So he felt [inaudible]
"Why, because I'm Sikh,"

01:46:16.950 --> 01:46:20.320
because she belonged
to a Sikh family.

01:46:20.320 --> 01:46:24.670
And he tells me, "That's
why I go to Gurdwara."

01:46:24.670 --> 01:46:26.770
And I said, "That's wonderful."

01:46:26.770 --> 01:46:30.230
But I didn't ask him
how they both manage,

01:46:30.230 --> 01:46:31.530
you know, because [inaudible].

01:46:31.530 --> 01:46:38.400
And then he asked me a
question that, "I have a son

01:46:38.400 --> 01:46:42.410
who only wants to
marry a Sikh woman."

01:46:42.410 --> 01:46:45.780
So I felt -- I wanted to ask
-- and this happened today,

01:46:45.780 --> 01:46:47.150
you know, so I want
to ask you --

01:46:47.150 --> 01:46:52.810
and you know, in your research
over there, did you meet anybody

01:46:52.810 --> 01:46:56.430
who was himself Sikh descendant?

01:46:56.430 --> 01:46:57.730
&gt;&gt; Amardeep Singh: How many
do you want me to [inaudible]?

01:46:57.730 --> 01:47:00.910
[Laughter] There's an entire
communities living there

01:47:00.910 --> 01:47:02.590
who don't -- so there are --

01:47:02.590 --> 01:47:05.760
as I said, there are one million
people who are Sikhs themselves

01:47:05.760 --> 01:47:08.010
who are sitting there,
who are proud Sikhs,

01:47:08.010 --> 01:47:09.310
in their mind they're Sikhs.

01:47:09.310 --> 01:47:12.130
There are 14,000 turban-wearing
Sikhs whom we think of as Sikhs,

01:47:12.130 --> 01:47:14.510
and whom the Pakistani
government counts as Sikhs.

01:47:14.510 --> 01:47:17.010
But the hearts of one
million people are believers

01:47:17.010 --> 01:47:18.310
of Sikh faith.

01:47:18.310 --> 01:47:19.610
That's the Sikhs themselves.

01:47:19.610 --> 01:47:21.040
How many people do
you want me to count?

01:47:21.040 --> 01:47:24.150
There are many -- people
have mentioned whom I've met,

01:47:24.150 --> 01:47:26.140
had lunch with them,
had stayed with them

01:47:26.140 --> 01:47:28.370
who have Sikh backgrounds,
but had to change their faith,

01:47:28.370 --> 01:47:31.140
either of choice,
either of the compulsion,

01:47:31.140 --> 01:47:32.470
either of the circumstances.

01:47:32.470 --> 01:47:35.570
My own distant aunt's story
in the book, "Meeting Moody,"

01:47:35.570 --> 01:47:37.410
who was just 20 is there.

01:47:37.410 --> 01:47:42.590
My own real aunt's
two sons had lived

01:47:42.590 --> 01:47:46.690
as Christians inside
[inaudible] for two years,

01:47:46.690 --> 01:47:48.500
because they were
five and six years old

01:47:48.500 --> 01:47:51.300
and their parents
were departed from --

01:47:51.300 --> 01:47:53.810
were separated from them in
the [inaudible] massacre,

01:47:53.810 --> 01:47:56.500
and then they were found after
about three to four years.

01:47:56.500 --> 01:47:58.000
My book starts on that story.

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:01.160
There are umpteen number
of instances like this.

01:48:01.160 --> 01:48:04.580
The upheaval that happened
was one million people died,

01:48:04.580 --> 01:48:06.970
ten million people moved.

01:48:06.970 --> 01:48:09.200
The cultures have shifted.

01:48:09.200 --> 01:48:10.520
The people from the Indus --

01:48:10.520 --> 01:48:14.180
from the Gangetic belt were
thrust into the Indus belt,

01:48:14.180 --> 01:48:16.590
and the people of the Indus
belt thrust elsewhere.

01:48:16.590 --> 01:48:19.090
It's a hodgepodge
that has happened.

01:48:19.090 --> 01:48:22.450
Languages, the issues
that we're talking about,

01:48:22.450 --> 01:48:25.400
the people in the Gangetic belt
don't understand the history

01:48:25.400 --> 01:48:27.340
and the faiths, how
they intertwined

01:48:27.340 --> 01:48:29.120
in this beautiful land of Indus.

01:48:29.120 --> 01:48:31.400
We were never separate.

01:48:31.400 --> 01:48:34.500
The Hindus, Sikhs, and
Muslims, they were fractured,

01:48:34.500 --> 01:48:37.330
hairline fracture but knew how
to live together for centuries.

01:48:37.330 --> 01:48:39.740
And that's why poetry
are beautiful things.

01:48:39.740 --> 01:48:41.720
Scriptures reflect that, right?

01:48:41.720 --> 01:48:43.730
But yet, when partition
happened,

01:48:43.730 --> 01:48:46.460
people who were not even knowing
of this culture were thrust

01:48:46.460 --> 01:48:50.740
into this land, and therefore
emerged a total confused state

01:48:50.740 --> 01:48:52.350
of mind on both sides
of the border.

01:48:52.350 --> 01:48:55.150
We have to go back to humanity.

01:48:57.330 --> 01:48:59.130
Yes.

01:48:59.130 --> 01:49:03.430
[ Inaudible Comment ]

01:49:03.430 --> 01:49:05.690
Amardeep Singh: [Laughs] So
the next steps basically,

01:49:05.690 --> 01:49:07.780
you know -- okay,
the short answer

01:49:07.780 --> 01:49:09.750
to that would be I don't know.

01:49:09.750 --> 01:49:11.440
I have no idea.

01:49:11.440 --> 01:49:14.330
I am living in a creative
space after my 25 years

01:49:14.330 --> 01:49:17.330
of corporate world where I
wish to make five-year plan,

01:49:17.330 --> 01:49:19.920
ten-year plan, 20-year plan,
and never achieve them anyway.

01:49:19.920 --> 01:49:22.630
And now, I make no plans
and something happens.

01:49:22.630 --> 01:49:23.930
Right; so I don't know.

01:49:23.930 --> 01:49:27.170
But I am under immense
internal turmoil,

01:49:27.170 --> 01:49:31.400
and I think the internal
turmoil should be there,

01:49:31.400 --> 01:49:33.200
because if you don't have
the internal turmoil,

01:49:33.200 --> 01:49:35.750
the creative space
cannot generate anything.

01:49:35.750 --> 01:49:40.420
And Gurbani [phonetic] says this
very well, "[Foreign language],"

01:49:40.420 --> 01:49:43.320
"Douk" [phonetic] is "Sadness
becomes your medicine,

01:49:43.320 --> 01:49:46.220
the remedy, and happiness
becomes your source

01:49:46.220 --> 01:49:49.330
of pulling you down,
your disease," right?

01:49:49.330 --> 01:49:52.300
And I think the unhappiness
is not the unhappiness

01:49:52.300 --> 01:49:54.860
from the world, but it's the
state of my mind that I grapple

01:49:54.860 --> 01:49:57.910
with day in and day out,
because my project seems

01:49:57.910 --> 01:49:59.930
to be coming to an end.

01:49:59.930 --> 01:50:02.240
And do I go on this
path further?

01:50:02.240 --> 01:50:04.510
There are Nanak Panthis who
are waiting to be called,

01:50:04.510 --> 01:50:06.180
and to be addressed,
and to be studied.

01:50:06.180 --> 01:50:08.660
How do I do it; I don't know.

01:50:08.660 --> 01:50:09.980
Can I do it; I don't know.

01:50:09.980 --> 01:50:12.360
There is a world which
requires financial commitment.

01:50:12.360 --> 01:50:15.920
There's a family that requires
-- I don't know how to do it.

01:50:15.920 --> 01:50:18.830
But last time I was thrust into
this by some unknown force,

01:50:18.830 --> 01:50:20.920
will it thrust me into it again?

01:50:20.920 --> 01:50:22.620
I just need to eat bread
and butter; I don't need

01:50:22.620 --> 01:50:23.920
to become a wealthy man.

01:50:23.920 --> 01:50:26.000
But what I'm leaving
here I know is the wealth

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:32.480
for the future communities
to come.

01:50:32.480 --> 01:50:36.590
&gt;&gt; Thank you Amardeep, thank
[inaudible] organize this.

01:50:36.590 --> 01:50:43.410
Do you think the -- what
Sikh has just kind of --

01:50:43.410 --> 01:50:44.950
in the middle of
[inaudible], right?

01:50:44.950 --> 01:50:49.260
And everything that
you're doing,

01:50:49.260 --> 01:50:54.750
everything in the same timeframe
of the last four, five,

01:50:54.750 --> 01:50:58.330
ten years there have been
other projects as well going

01:50:58.330 --> 01:51:01.930
on related to Sikh, and
preservation, and revival.

01:51:01.930 --> 01:51:06.110
Can that -- can the -- some
of the effects of the --

01:51:06.110 --> 01:51:08.550
what happened in '47,
can they be reversed?

01:51:08.550 --> 01:51:10.010
&gt;&gt; Amardeep Singh: Of course.

01:51:10.010 --> 01:51:11.450
&gt;&gt; Since -- okay.

01:51:11.450 --> 01:51:12.750
&gt;&gt; Amardeep Singh:
Okay, go ahead.

01:51:12.750 --> 01:51:14.050
&gt;&gt; The access can be better
and access to [inaudible] --

01:51:14.050 --> 01:51:16.160
&gt;&gt; Amardeep Singh: If you
don't believe in something,

01:51:16.160 --> 01:51:18.990
nothing is going to happen.

01:51:18.990 --> 01:51:22.780
If I didn't believe that I
could generate a research,

01:51:22.780 --> 01:51:25.130
just my own belief,
nothing would have happened.

01:51:25.130 --> 01:51:26.750
I think everything
stems from belief.

01:51:26.750 --> 01:51:29.010
So we have to believe that
we can change the world

01:51:29.010 --> 01:51:30.490
for positivity, right?

01:51:30.490 --> 01:51:33.290
Then, things will
start happening.

01:51:33.290 --> 01:51:36.740
As far as you saying that
so much is happening around,

01:51:36.740 --> 01:51:38.140
yes, a lot is happening.

01:51:38.140 --> 01:51:39.670
But if I'm going
to be very myopic

01:51:39.670 --> 01:51:42.430
on this subject oSikh
legacy in Pakistan, sorry,

01:51:42.430 --> 01:51:45.120
I'm going to ask you, "What else
has happened in seven decades,

01:51:45.120 --> 01:51:47.230
other than just maintaining
the [inaudible], going around

01:51:47.230 --> 01:51:50.680
and around in circles, whitening
them, putting gold, putting,

01:51:50.680 --> 01:51:52.720
you know, money inside it,
giving more money to people

01:51:52.720 --> 01:51:54.280
to go and destroy
more of our heritage,

01:51:54.280 --> 01:51:55.820
what else has happened?

01:51:55.820 --> 01:51:57.740
Nothing. It's taken
you seven decades

01:51:57.740 --> 01:51:59.760
to generate anything
on a legacy.

01:51:59.760 --> 01:52:01.280
Some Gurdwara books
have been generated,

01:52:01.280 --> 01:52:04.810
but it's all Gurdwara centric,
and legacy is not religion.

01:52:04.810 --> 01:52:08.050
So I don't think anything
has happened as yet.

01:52:08.050 --> 01:52:09.350
Things can happen.

01:52:09.350 --> 01:52:12.350
What I think is that what
we're leaving in the forms

01:52:12.350 --> 01:52:15.940
of these 1,000 pages is
a dialogue initiator.

01:52:15.940 --> 01:52:18.850
It's the foundation of
something on which both

01:52:18.850 --> 01:52:22.980
by the Pakistan people, and for
the Sikhs, and for the Hindus,

01:52:22.980 --> 01:52:26.650
and for the Muslims that allows
us to come together and say,

01:52:26.650 --> 01:52:30.000
"Oh, my God, we have
forgotten this."

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.590
I think my work should
inspire a Muslim to get up

01:52:32.590 --> 01:52:34.280
and do the same thing
in East Punjab.

01:52:34.280 --> 01:52:36.070
I think my work should
inspire a [inaudible] Hindu

01:52:36.070 --> 01:52:38.050
for doing the same
thing in Pakistan.

01:52:38.050 --> 01:52:40.380
And when we can do it
altogether, it's not for Sikh,

01:52:40.380 --> 01:52:43.360
it's for a bigger picture
about all coming together.

01:52:43.360 --> 01:52:44.940
But from a Sikh perspective,

01:52:44.940 --> 01:52:48.860
I hope these two works become
the foundation of us to get --

01:52:48.860 --> 01:52:52.540
build castles on them, but
without having the data,

01:52:52.540 --> 01:52:53.840
you cannot do anything.

01:52:53.840 --> 01:52:55.530
I'll tell you I met the
Iraqi Trust Property Board

01:52:55.530 --> 01:52:58.210
in February this
time with the head

01:52:58.210 --> 01:53:00.210
of the Iraqi Trust
Property Board he's looking

01:53:00.210 --> 01:53:01.810
at [inaudible] at my
books that I gifted them,

01:53:01.810 --> 01:53:04.710
and he's asking a very
interesting question and that --

01:53:04.710 --> 01:53:08.450
and therein lies the answer
of hope and what we can do.

01:53:08.450 --> 01:53:11.710
He's opening the book and he
says, "Where is this place?"

01:53:11.710 --> 01:53:14.290
And I'm looking at
him and I said,

01:53:14.290 --> 01:53:16.440
"Some of my forefathers
left it in your custody.

01:53:16.440 --> 01:53:18.910
You tell me where is it."

01:53:18.910 --> 01:53:20.820
He called this man,
"Get the register.

01:53:20.820 --> 01:53:23.180
See if this place is there."

01:53:23.180 --> 01:53:27.120
What I'm trying to say is people
do jobs; bureaucrats do jobs.

01:53:27.120 --> 01:53:28.980
They are there for three
to four years to do a job.

01:53:28.980 --> 01:53:30.420
First year they're
trying to learn,

01:53:30.420 --> 01:53:32.490
second year they are
trying to grapple,

01:53:32.490 --> 01:53:33.790
third year they are
trying to look

01:53:33.790 --> 01:53:35.670
at the next exit plan; next job.

01:53:35.670 --> 01:53:37.940
Who's doing the job of
maintaining and doing things?

01:53:37.940 --> 01:53:39.960
And then comes to our community
with pot loads of money.

01:53:39.960 --> 01:53:42.630
They open the doors for us to
actually go and preserve it.

01:53:42.630 --> 01:53:44.560
And the preservation is
not heritage maintenance,

01:53:44.560 --> 01:53:46.110
and it's heritage destruction.

01:53:46.110 --> 01:53:48.480
So when he's asking a
question, "Where is this place,"

01:53:48.480 --> 01:53:49.930
I am happy he's asking
the question,

01:53:49.930 --> 01:53:52.880
because now the data
is lying on his table.

01:53:52.880 --> 01:53:55.270
And he tells the
man, "Make a trip.

01:53:55.270 --> 01:53:57.470
Next fortnight, I want to go
to Sindh and see [inaudible].

01:53:57.470 --> 01:54:00.470
I want to see this place."

01:54:00.470 --> 01:54:01.880
Whether something happens or no,

01:54:01.880 --> 01:54:05.240
what is the momentum we
can build, time will tell.

01:54:05.240 --> 01:54:07.700
Can I lead everything;
no I'm one man right now.

01:54:07.700 --> 01:54:10.410
Can we come together and do
something, I think we can.

01:54:10.410 --> 01:54:11.710
A lot can happen.

01:54:11.710 --> 01:54:13.330
I think the intent is there.

01:54:13.330 --> 01:54:14.780
The government has the intent.

01:54:14.780 --> 01:54:16.730
The question is, "How do
we navigate through this?

01:54:16.730 --> 01:54:20.170
How do we not get stuck in
our mud slingings and think

01:54:20.170 --> 01:54:24.590
of a bigger picture," because
a lot needs to be done.

01:54:24.590 --> 01:54:28.790
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Loar: And
I think we have time

01:54:28.790 --> 01:54:33.810
for just one more question.

01:54:33.810 --> 01:54:35.110
&gt;&gt; Amardeep Singh: Sure.

01:54:35.110 --> 01:54:36.410
I'll take hers.

01:54:36.410 --> 01:54:43.850
&gt;&gt; I was curious to hear
what the response has been

01:54:43.850 --> 01:54:46.960
when you approached either
[inaudible] in India,

01:54:46.960 --> 01:54:53.070
but specifically from the Indian
government and Sikhs living

01:54:53.070 --> 01:54:59.680
in India; because I feel
like how we are [inaudible]

01:54:59.680 --> 01:55:04.990
or at least my generation were
born and raised in the States.

01:55:04.990 --> 01:55:11.880
We -- I'd like to think that
we have a very secular view

01:55:11.880 --> 01:55:13.480
of Sikhs.

01:55:13.480 --> 01:55:18.070
But we feel like there was
a disconnect between us

01:55:18.070 --> 01:55:22.440
and older generations or how
to practiced in India now.

01:55:22.440 --> 01:55:27.850
So how has the response been?

01:55:27.850 --> 01:55:29.870
&gt;&gt; Amardeep Singh:
Response to what?

01:55:29.870 --> 01:55:31.250
&gt;&gt; Response to this project

01:55:31.250 --> 01:55:33.000
about that our roots
are in Pakistan.

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:36.570
You know, there's so much that
we, you know, have neglected,

01:55:36.570 --> 01:55:41.210
or we haven't been
able to go back to.

01:55:41.210 --> 01:55:42.510
So --

01:55:42.510 --> 01:55:44.150
&gt;&gt; Amardeep Singh: So I think
response is the same everywhere.

01:55:44.150 --> 01:55:48.160
It's got nothing to do with
India, Pakistan, or US, or UK,

01:55:48.160 --> 01:55:50.310
whatever Sikh communities,
response is the same.

01:55:50.310 --> 01:55:56.980
The struggle for me as an
individual has been the belief

01:55:56.980 --> 01:56:04.150
that I have in me that this
needs to be done, and struggling

01:56:04.150 --> 01:56:08.150
to do it, to do it, and get
it to a point where it is now,

01:56:08.150 --> 01:56:14.810
and now engaging
with communities

01:56:14.810 --> 01:56:16.110
to bring them together.

01:56:16.110 --> 01:56:17.410
It has not been easy.

01:56:17.410 --> 01:56:20.700
But in that process, the
question is maintenance

01:56:20.700 --> 01:56:22.790
of the monument is
a far off vision.

01:56:22.790 --> 01:56:24.430
In the midterm, I'm
only having dialogues

01:56:24.430 --> 01:56:26.080
with the Pakistan government.

01:56:26.080 --> 01:56:29.270
I'm having dialogues with
very different people.

01:56:29.270 --> 01:56:33.900
But yet we are not able to come
together as a cohesive force.

01:56:33.900 --> 01:56:35.880
But I believe somewhere
it has to start.

01:56:35.880 --> 01:56:41.440
Because if you start, magnets
will actually pull us together.

01:56:41.440 --> 01:56:42.790
But if you are doing
the right thing,

01:56:42.790 --> 01:56:44.090
right things will come together.

01:56:44.090 --> 01:56:46.990
So as of right now,
these are early days.

01:56:46.990 --> 01:56:50.240
We are not able to
pull together to people

01:56:50.240 --> 01:56:52.600
to own a monument
and preserve it.

01:56:52.600 --> 01:56:53.900
That's number one.

01:56:53.900 --> 01:56:55.460
The number two is a
short-term approach is in India,

01:56:55.460 --> 01:56:56.760
for instance, I'm
seeing, you know,

01:56:56.760 --> 01:56:58.060
you can afford these books.

01:56:58.060 --> 01:56:59.980
These books are not easy to do.

01:56:59.980 --> 01:57:01.280
You have to give
up huge amounts;

01:57:01.280 --> 01:57:05.510
you have to do research
costs, you have to throw money

01:57:05.510 --> 01:57:08.520
to get the data out inside.

01:57:08.520 --> 01:57:10.400
You physically go and do it.

01:57:10.400 --> 01:57:13.350
And then printing the
publication gets expensive

01:57:13.350 --> 01:57:15.730
in India, for the
common man in India.

01:57:15.730 --> 01:57:17.330
For Pakistan, it gets expensive.

01:57:17.330 --> 01:57:21.050
My vision is you can
afford it in these worlds

01:57:21.050 --> 01:57:24.700
because your purchasing
power is much bigger.

01:57:24.700 --> 01:57:27.010
But in India, it
always gets questioned,

01:57:27.010 --> 01:57:28.590
"Why are the books
so expensive?"

01:57:28.590 --> 01:57:30.040
They are seeing it as a book,

01:57:30.040 --> 01:57:32.370
they're not seeing the
experience and the things

01:57:32.370 --> 01:57:33.700
that have gone behind it.

01:57:33.700 --> 01:57:36.480
And I'm telling this
about your own heritage.

01:57:36.480 --> 01:57:39.980
When are you going to own it?

01:57:39.980 --> 01:57:41.560
They are not even wanting --

01:57:41.560 --> 01:57:46.400
an organization in India
has not even supported me

01:57:46.400 --> 01:57:48.480
to my simple program
that I'm saying,

01:57:48.480 --> 01:57:51.650
"Help me put these books
inside the libraries

01:57:51.650 --> 01:57:53.540
of Sikh institutions inside."

01:57:53.540 --> 01:57:56.070
It's been three years now; not a
single organization in India --

01:57:56.070 --> 01:57:58.990
in Punjab has come forward to
say, "We will take 200 books

01:57:58.990 --> 01:58:01.220
to put them inside the
schools and colleges."

01:58:01.220 --> 01:58:05.010
Because the next
generation needs to see it.

01:58:05.010 --> 01:58:06.310
They were not seen
for seven decades.

01:58:06.310 --> 01:58:09.160
That's the kind of
blankness that you see, right?

01:58:09.160 --> 01:58:10.700
So that's the big
issue out here.

01:58:10.700 --> 01:58:12.860
I'm saying why should the
Pakistanis not have these books?

01:58:12.860 --> 01:58:14.330
Because I get every month
five to six people asking me

01:58:14.330 --> 01:58:15.980
in Pakistan -- from Pakistan, "I
want to do a PhD work on this.

01:58:15.980 --> 01:58:17.280
I will look at the Sikh murals.

01:58:17.280 --> 01:58:18.580
I want to see it --
understand some Sikh theology,

01:58:18.580 --> 01:58:19.880
Sikh architecture."

01:58:19.880 --> 01:58:21.180
And I'm believing that these
books need to be put out there.

01:58:21.180 --> 01:58:22.480
You know what, it's
a big problem

01:58:22.480 --> 01:58:23.780
to get these books inside
the institutions there,

01:58:23.780 --> 01:58:25.080
because from India you have to
move a huge amounts of books.

01:58:25.080 --> 01:58:26.380
How can we enable this
through a partnership

01:58:26.380 --> 01:58:27.680
with the Pakistan government,
and who will support this?

01:58:27.680 --> 01:58:28.980
If I'm going to expect that each
individual organization is going

01:58:28.980 --> 01:58:30.280
to actually bring in a
book, it may not happen.

01:58:30.280 --> 01:58:31.580
[Inaudible] Sikh man who
says, "You know what,

01:58:31.580 --> 01:58:32.880
I'm going to sponsor
a hundred books

01:58:32.880 --> 01:58:34.180
for your project and
get them inside."

01:58:34.180 --> 01:58:35.480
I'm struggling to get that.

01:58:35.480 --> 01:58:36.780
So it is a struggle;
it's not easy.

01:58:36.780 --> 01:58:38.080
And the last thing what
I'm saying is when I look

01:58:38.080 --> 01:58:39.380
at Nanak Panthis sitting there,

01:58:39.380 --> 01:58:40.680
let's talk about where is
Amardeep in all of this?

01:58:40.680 --> 01:58:41.980
Amardeep's fluent
in [inaudible];

01:58:41.980 --> 01:58:43.280
I have the ability to do that.

01:58:43.280 --> 01:58:44.580
I've done two publications
in a very short time.

01:58:44.580 --> 01:58:45.880
Do I want to study in Nanak
Panthis and understand

01:58:45.880 --> 01:58:47.180
and document them for
our next generations?

01:58:47.180 --> 01:58:48.480
It's a project that
needs to be done.

01:58:48.480 --> 01:58:49.780
Am I getting support?

01:58:49.780 --> 01:58:51.080
I'm really hitting
a head block --

01:58:51.080 --> 01:58:52.380
a roadblock; I don't know
where to go now from here,

01:58:52.380 --> 01:58:53.680
because I'm not associated
with an institution.

01:58:53.680 --> 01:58:54.980
I don't have grants with me.

01:58:54.980 --> 01:58:56.280
I'm just doing it on my own.

01:58:56.280 --> 01:58:57.580
So all I'm trying to tell you
is it's a challenging task.

01:58:57.580 --> 01:58:58.880
But I believe if you
do the things right,

01:58:58.880 --> 01:59:00.180
if we lay the foundation
on this,

01:59:00.180 --> 01:59:01.480
someone is going to
build the castle.

01:59:01.480 --> 01:59:02.780
Will it be me who will
build it, I don't know.

01:59:02.780 --> 01:59:04.080
But someone is going
to build it for sure.

01:59:04.080 --> 01:59:05.380
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Loar: And
I think on that note

01:59:05.380 --> 01:59:06.680
that brings our great
lecture for today to a close.

01:59:06.680 --> 01:59:07.980
It's an incredible journey
on an important topic,

01:59:07.980 --> 01:59:09.280
and a very powerful presentation

01:59:09.280 --> 01:59:10.580
that we have the
honor to hear today.

01:59:10.580 --> 01:59:11.880
&gt;&gt; Amardeep Singh: Thank you.

01:59:11.880 --> 01:59:13.180
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Loar: So
thank you very much

01:59:13.180 --> 01:59:14.480
for coming, Amardeep Singh.

01:59:14.480 --> 01:59:15.780
Let's give him [inaudible].

01:59:15.780 --> 01:59:17.080
[ Applause ]

01:59:17.080 --> 01:59:18.380
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
