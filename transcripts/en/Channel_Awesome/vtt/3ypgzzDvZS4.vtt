Aunt Despair: Well, there's no doubt about it.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:06.960
Our daughter is a twat.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.120
Tired of not being able to keep your child under control?

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.880
[Incessant whining]

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.780
This is what the morning after pill is for, you know.

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:17.440
Well fear not, for we have the perfect solution.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.660
Try 80's movies.

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.920
The 80's were a time when all children's media wanted to do was scare the shit out of you.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.600
And now you can bring their horrendous horrors to your home.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.580
Hey, honey! Wanna see cute little mousies in the Secret of Nimh?

Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!!!"

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:39.580

to something wicket this way comes.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.560
80's films tried to scare life lessons into your child's nightmares

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.460
to the point where the can't even
remember what those life lessons are.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.620
Atreyu: "Artax! Noooooo!"

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.640
But can't we get in trouble for showing our kids that?

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.140
No problem. 
Most 80's films have a PG rating

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.340
but that was back when it actually stood for something.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.180
Nowadays, it stands for practically G.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.520
So, you can plead naive innocence to your cruelty.

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.140
If she does just show her Watership Down.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.280

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.120
Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.120
I remember it so you don't have to.

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.700
We see a lot of stars in our lifetime.

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.400
Some old, some new.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.400
Some shine brighter than others.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.900
We know that eventually every star has to disappear.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.020
But when one that shined so uniquely fades,

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.460
the sky doesn't feel the same without it.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.560
Especially when it orbited a solar system of other uniquely shining stars

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.760
that brought us a galaxy of wonder that we still look in awe at today.

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.740
And just in time for it's 30th anniversary, 
we're going to look at that galaxy.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.360
This is Labyrinth.

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.880
This is a film that's certainly been no stranger in the past

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.500
yet Labyrinth has never been given a full Nostalgia Critic review.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.580
On the one hand, you can see why. It's a good movie.

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.700
Directed by Jim Henson, written by Terry Jones, produced by George Lucas

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.120
and with songs by the film's antagonist, the late David Bowie.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.760
But on the other hand, it's such a strange and out there flick

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:28.600
that it's impossible not to shake your head and laugh 
at the surreal drug overdose that you're experiencing.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.120
It deserves to be talked about and
that's exactly what we're going to do.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.800
So experience the wonder and...huh?

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.700
Of one of the strangest films to ever come out in the 80s.

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.700
Let's take a look at Labyrinth.

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.720
["Underground" by David Bowie plays]

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:47.340
Wow, The Owls of Ga'Hoole  
doesn't hold up as well as I thought.

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.060
Actually, that's just the opening credits.

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.840
Leading us to a girl named Sarah, played by Jennifer Connelly

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.880
Doing Shakespeare in the park all by herself while reciting lines to a perched owl and her dog.

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.940
That's...just what I imagined a girl who
looks like Jennifer Connelly would do.

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.480
[Bell rings] 
"I don't believe it! It's seven o' clock!"

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.840
Because every 80s kids film has to start with the main character being late for something

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.260
she finds she's late for babysitting her brother, Toby

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.940
and her mother's shoulder pads are not happy about this at all.

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:16.080
Mother: "You're an hour late!"

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:18.120
Sarah: "I said I'm sorry!"
--"Please let me finish!"

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:18.880
Father: "We were worried about you!"

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.100
[baby crying]
Sarah: "I can't do anything right can I?!"

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:26.440
Yeah, as you probably noticed very quickly, 
our main character is a bit of a pain in the ass.

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:30.740
"There was a beautiful young girl who's stepmother always made her stay home with the baby."

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.480
She's like a one person Facebook argument.

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.600
She even gets upset if her teddy bear is not in the right place.

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:40.380
"Lancelot! Someone has been in my room again!"

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.060
"I hate that!"

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:43.680
[yells] "I HATE IT!"

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.280
"The first sign of accepting my white privilege is acting like I hate it!"

"I hate you! I HATE YOU!"

"You really wanted to talk to me didn't you?
Practically broke down the door!"

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.940
Granted her performance does get better as the film goes on but for the first ten minutes,

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:06.320
you can pretty much call her "Hayden Connelly".

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.020

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:09.600

"You underestimate my power."

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.180
Though to be fair she does go in and out 
of a British accent like Carrie Fisher.

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.180
"You really wanted to talk to me."

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:23.920
"Knock it off."

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.880
"I wish the goblins would come and take you--."

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.480
Maybe Lucas productions have a weird British accent virus.

"Goblin King, Goblin King, wherever you may be,

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:36.000

"You know what you need, honey?"

Sarah: "Magic and mystery?"

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:46.480
"No, Xolaf and Riddelin, just mix it in with the liquid tranquilizer."

"No, I mustn't...I mustn't say."

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:57.640
So, she offers up her baby brother to the Goblin King...

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.040
Again, as most teenagers do...

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:03.980
But supporters from a Trump Rally intercept the message

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:06.840
and somehow make everything she was talking about come true.

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:09.540

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.560
"Forget about the baby."

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:35.540
"I can't, it isn't that I don't appreciate
 what you're trying to do for me."

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:38.900
"I'm very thankful you're kidnapping
 my brother and sexually awakening me

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:40.020
but I just can't!"

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:57.180
"He's there. In my castle. Do you still want to look for him?"

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:59.640
Sarah: "Is that the castle beyond the Goblin City?"

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:04.300
Nostalgia Critic: [imitating Bowie] "No that's a painting, that's a model, and that's a very poor blue screen effect

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:06.580
But what do you care? I'm David Bowie."

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:09.740
"You have thirteen hours in which to solve the labyrinth

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:14.220
[voice echoing] before your baby 
brother becomes one of us...forever."

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:21.280
So, Sarah is pretty accepting of the whole goblins being real and one of them looking like a male Cruella De Vil.

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:24.440
As she begins her journey through the
mysterious and whimsical Labyrinth.

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:26.200

"Oh, uhh, excuse me!"

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.520
This creature's name is Hoggle.

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:34.860
Who spends most of his time finding
beautiful fairies and gassing them.

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:37.160
God, I love 80s films.

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:40.180

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:42.320
"What'd ya expect fairies to do?"

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:43.500
"Like granting wishes."

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:45.160
"Shows what you know, don't it?"

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:46.760
"I'd tried to say I don't believe in them

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:50.200
but then the Gay Pride parade comes around and suddenly they all come back to life!"

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:52.220
"Thanks for nothing, Hogwart."

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:53.500
[angrily] "It's Hoggle!"

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:55.500
"Christ, do you want to get sued?!"

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:58.960
While that's going on, the Goblin King partakes in...

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:04.140
What I can only describe as a Muppet show musical number starring David Bowie.

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:08.620
♪ Dance, magic dance ♪

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:10.900
♪ Put that baby's spell on me ♪

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:14.280
The song is obviously the catchiest in
 the film and the puppet work is great too.

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:19.520
Though, let's be honest. The greatest puppet work is what's going on in David Bowie's pants.

00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:25.640
The jokes made from us about the ferret he was so kind enough to give a home between his legs

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:26.960
are too many to count.

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:29.340
In my opinion, I have already worked overtime for it.

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:35.860
So, because of this, I am refusing to do my 
top 10 David Bowie dick jokes for this review.

00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:39.920
It has to be top 15.

Is that Gonzo's nose in your pants 
or are you just happy to see me?

Someones got a rocket in their pocket!

00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:58.440
If you have an erection that lasts more than 4 hours, you're probably David Bowie.

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:00.920
You shoulda seen the NC-17 cut.

my spaceship knows which way to go.

It's the missing Muppet: Stiffy!

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:17.040
You think that was puppeted by Frank Oz?

Any tighter and those pants will be a thong!

And the #1 David Bowie dick joke is...

"Because that's the way it's done."

then that is the way you must do it."

So, Sarah plays "Where's Waldo?", M.C. Escher edition, as Bowie proves what we've known all along...

00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:23.440
That he's actually a hologram.

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:25.440
I knew it! No man that awesome could exist!

00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:32.000
The funny thing is, even though he sings a cool song and partakes in some really pretty damn amazing effects

00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:34.460
he looks sad throughout the majority of it.

00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:38.100
For such a shaky motivation, he becomes so suddenly emotional.

Jareth: "but I can be cruel."

00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:02.680
But alas, it's time to finally hear his evil plan.

00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:04.400
Jareth: "Just fear me..."

00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:09.200
"Love me. Do as I say and I will be your slave."

00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:11.200
That makes no sense.

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:15.260
How can she submit to you and yet you be her slave?

00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:21.360
Unless this is a...50 Shades of Grey kind of thing, which, to be fair if there's any man who can pull that off!

Toby is back, the parents return home,

00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:43.260

00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:06.320
Well, okay! It doesn't make as much sense as Sarah reading a book that comes to life

00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:08.360
because she doesn't want to babysit her brother

00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:11.600
resulting in her fantasizing about David Bowie's space oddity

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:14.860
and reciting the words from the book makes it all go away.

00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:17.740

00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:19.380
A lot.

While the story doesn't always make sense and it does have trouble staying focused,

Labyrinth is an obvious excuse just to 
play with amazing visuals and cool ideas.

the imagination is beyond inspiring,

and, of course, David Bowie steals the show in every frame he's in.

00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:47.560
He just embodies the mystery, strangeness and all around coolness of who he was in this performance.

00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:53.320
It's great to see so much effort from so many talented people come together to give us something, not perfect,

Sure, it can be weird and awkward at times,

00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:04.220
but it's technology is spectacular, it's simple storytelling endearing, and it's ability to suck us into another world

00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:08.580
