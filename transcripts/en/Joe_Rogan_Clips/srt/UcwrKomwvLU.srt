1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,460
The Joe Rogan experience,
you know, like, Ooh,

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:07,710
it gives me like serious anxiety when
I find out that someone got a Vegas

3
00:00:07,711 --> 00:00:12,600
residency. I go, how many nights a week?

4
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:17,010
Six,
six nights a week at the stratosphere.

5
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:22,000
It sounds, I mean, somebody told me David
spade was thinking about doing one. Oh.

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,040
And he went to go see Louis Anderson
who was doing one this before, baskets.

7
00:00:26,041 --> 00:00:27,960
And he was like, it was just the
saddest thing I've ever seen.

8
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,440
That was like Carlin's last
stand was a Vegas residency.

9
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:35,340
Did he have a Vegas residency? Yeah.
Where was he at? I forget where he was,

10
00:00:35,341 --> 00:00:39,240
but he had like a meltdown where
he like went off on the crowd,

11
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:42,840
just like talk to calling him all
pieces of shit. Really. And Yeah.

12
00:00:42,841 --> 00:00:46,620
And then had to go to rehab was like,
I'm addicted to painkillers, like,

13
00:00:46,621 --> 00:00:50,460
and then on the giver, I don't
they ever performed again. Well,

14
00:00:50,461 --> 00:00:53,430
he died before he died.

15
00:00:53,431 --> 00:00:57,330
Like he was performing when he died.
I mean,

16
00:00:57,331 --> 00:00:59,610
I think he was at a hotel,

17
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:04,170
I'm pretty sure he was sleeping in a
hotel that he was performing at when he

18
00:01:04,171 --> 00:01:06,100
died. I believe that, but I,

19
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:09,740
cause I had done that last
special he did was terrible. We,

20
00:01:09,741 --> 00:01:12,990
he's like reading half of it. Oh, I
didn't see that. It's, it was, it was,

21
00:01:12,991 --> 00:01:15,420
it was just like, you
know, a swan song for him.

22
00:01:15,421 --> 00:01:18,810
But I think that was after
the Vegas residency, so
must've been doing more. Yeah,

23
00:01:18,811 --> 00:01:22,890
his schedule was very,
very hectic and unusual.

24
00:01:22,891 --> 00:01:24,840
He was doing one hour a year,

25
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:29,070
an hour specialty would film
and he would write it all out.

26
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,430
Like he would write it all out
and then tweak it a little bit,

27
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:37,820
but it was more of a monologue then it
was like set up punchline jokes and he

28
00:01:38,701 --> 00:01:39,534
seemed to,

29
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:45,140
he was falling into this more like more
of a social commentator in some aspects

30
00:01:46,381 --> 00:01:49,860
than he was a stand up towards the
end. You know what I mean? Oh yeah.

31
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:50,940
Someone told me that he,

32
00:01:50,941 --> 00:01:54,680
a lot of the reason he did an
hour every year was because, uh,

33
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:58,490
the tax problems with the IRS
was coming out in hard. And uh,

34
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,170
so we had to be working that much
and it kind of made them miserable.

35
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,370
You know the story about
his nine 11 story, right.

36
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:10,620
Um, tell me where he
recorded a special called.

37
00:02:10,621 --> 00:02:13,860
I kinda like it when a lot of people die.
That was the name of the special,

38
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:18,750
and he has his whole egg closes with a
big long 20 minute thing about like when

39
00:02:18,751 --> 00:02:20,880
he hears about people dying,
he liked the more the better.

40
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,120
And he filmed it on like September 10th
and then the next day came in and was

41
00:02:26,851 --> 00:02:28,530
like, we've got to,
we've got to cancel this,

42
00:02:28,531 --> 00:02:31,920
but no one can ever see this or hear
this and now you can get the album.

43
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,230
But even in the album, he's
reading it. They like it.

44
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:38,940
They destroyed the actual footage from the
taping. Really? Yeah. They destroyed it.

45
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:43,020
Oh. He was just like, there's no one
can ever see this. Wow. According to,

46
00:02:43,021 --> 00:02:45,720
in Vegas at the MGM Grand
on September 9th and 10th,

47
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:52,260
September 9th and 10th. That's
crazy. Yeah. What was it called?

48
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,690
I kinda like it when a lot of people die.
Jesus Christ,

49
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:02,360
he woken up the morning
of September 11th and go,

50
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:05,470
did I manifest this? Yeah, look at that.

51
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,190
I kind of like it when a lot of
people die. And so the audio CD,

52
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:14,170
it's just him talking. It's
like him working out the, uh,

53
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:15,580
wait a minute.
It's a streaming.

54
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:20,110
I like the audio streaming with Amazon
prime's audio. There's no video of it.

55
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,630
I'll look and see if there is some,

56
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:27,400
some person who works somewhere.
It might've preserved it. I mean,

57
00:03:27,401 --> 00:03:29,000
I feel like I would've heard
about it. I mean, like I said,

58
00:03:29,001 --> 00:03:32,560
I listened to the bit and it's, he's like,
I've got to read, this is how I do it.

59
00:03:32,561 --> 00:03:36,970
So it's like a very early version of
it. But, uh, it's not great, but I mean,

60
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:37,480
I can't,

61
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:42,400
I can't even imagine taping a special on
September 10th he had some dark moments

62
00:03:42,401 --> 00:03:43,234
in his career.

63
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:48,450
I took some friends to see him in
1988 at the Hampton Beach Casino.

64
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:53,670
I think that's what it was called
in Hampton Beach, New Hampshire.

65
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:57,520
It's like a place where people would
go up for vacation and we went to see a

66
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,780
George Carlin there way back in the day
and he always had the same opening act

67
00:04:01,781 --> 00:04:04,630
and the same opening.
I kind of knew even back then cause I was,

68
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:08,030
I guess I was an open miker then
I was just starting out. Um,

69
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:10,930
I knew there were certain guys who took
people on the road with them that were

70
00:04:10,931 --> 00:04:14,050
terrible. They took people on the
road with them that just didn't,

71
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:15,490
they weren't good comics,

72
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,640
but they made them look like heroes and
[inaudible] they were friends with them

73
00:04:18,641 --> 00:04:21,760
or because he just wanted to have like
the worst comic ever go up before then?

74
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:26,530
It's a good question. You know,
you'd have to, I guess it would vary,

75
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:30,490
but for sure there's certain comics that
like it when people go on in front of

76
00:04:30,491 --> 00:04:33,720
them suck. They do, they
want that, you know,

77
00:04:33,721 --> 00:04:36,700
there's certain comics that you see them
taking people on the road and you look

78
00:04:36,701 --> 00:04:39,730
at it, you're like, what the fuck?
You're taking that guy with you.

79
00:04:39,731 --> 00:04:44,560
Like what are you doing? Why? Why are you
torturing people like that? Yeah. But, uh,

80
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:49,030
the opening acted better than George.
Like he had terrible set.

81
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,040
He had this whole rant that
he was doing cause he like,

82
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:55,990
he had an unquestionably one of
the greatest comics of all time,

83
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:58,570
but he had hours that were just not good.

84
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:02,020
And there was a period of time where
it seemed like he just missed it.

85
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,880
Like it was like,
it was missing,

86
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,610
whether it was his personal
life was off or whatever it was.

87
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:11,770
But he had this whole rant that was
like, fuck this. And he was like,

88
00:05:11,771 --> 00:05:16,450
and fuck Israel and fuck comedy clubs.
Like he was saying, fuck comedy clubs,

89
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,710
like this is like this whole bit.

90
00:05:17,711 --> 00:05:21,880
And he was reading it off of a yellow
legal pad and the whole audience was like

91
00:05:21,881 --> 00:05:24,460
standing there like not understanding
like where this was going.

92
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:29,020
Like we're waiting for the jokes. Where's
the hilarity? Whereas it, and it wasn't,

93
00:05:29,021 --> 00:05:32,160
it just didn't exist.
And my friends were mad at me really.

94
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:35,290
I had taken him from where we live.

95
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:40,270
We lived in revere and we all drove all
the way up to New Hampshire. Like, yeah,

96
00:05:40,271 --> 00:05:43,390
we're going to go see George Collins is
going to be awesome. And it was terrible.

97
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:44,260
It's funny,

98
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:49,060
I remember Louis Ck and like an interview
years ago was talking about how he

99
00:05:49,061 --> 00:05:52,510
took the pressure came off of
him to always have a good show.

100
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:56,290
But you said audience members love
saying, Oh, I saw George Collin once.

101
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:59,690
And he was, but they really
loved saying, you know,

102
00:05:59,691 --> 00:06:03,080
I saw Carlin once and he was horrible.
Like they,

103
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:07,790
they still get the experience and the
story of it and that that's it's theirs

104
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:11,060
forever. You have to worry about
doing a bad shedder though.

105
00:06:11,061 --> 00:06:15,620
If they say you were funny. I think it's,
I think to see a legend bomb would be,

106
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,120
uh, would be great. Well,
if you are a Carl and fan,

107
00:06:20,121 --> 00:06:23,330
you've got to see those. If you went
to see him live a bunch of times, yeah,

108
00:06:23,331 --> 00:06:28,250
he had those rough spots, man. You know,
it's, um, it's one of those things,

109
00:06:28,251 --> 00:06:31,490
if you're going to do an
hour of stand up every year,

110
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:37,040
you're going to have some rough ones.
There's just no way around that. Oh, 100%.

111
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:41,180
It seems like that's just,
I mean it can be done.

112
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,310
I think it can be done.
I mean,

113
00:06:43,311 --> 00:06:48,110
I think you can put together like I'm
six months in from my last special,

114
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,930
I think I could do another
special in six months,

115
00:06:50,931 --> 00:06:53,870
but it wouldn't be as good as my
last one, I don't think. Yeah,

116
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:58,430
I just don't think it would, I just
think you need time. Yeah. One a year.

117
00:06:58,431 --> 00:07:00,380
It's crazy.
It's insane.

118
00:07:00,381 --> 00:07:03,800
Like the guys like Jimmy Carr
who while they're touring,

119
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:07,370
they're writing jokes and just putting
them away. So at the end of the tour,

120
00:07:07,371 --> 00:07:08,181
when they taped the special,

121
00:07:08,181 --> 00:07:12,950
they have all these jokes they can go
through and look at and then start the new

122
00:07:12,951 --> 00:07:17,930
tour from that. That seems like I like
to sit in my set, you know what I mean?

123
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:21,710
I just want it to be focused on that and
not always be writing the next thing.

124
00:07:21,711 --> 00:07:24,230
But some people who are just like,
I'm just going to go up and talk.

125
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,000
And it's happening a lot now.

126
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,580
I think with like the
prevalence of Netflix specials,

127
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,760
people just want the money and they're
famous enough they can just go up and

128
00:07:31,761 --> 00:07:34,970
just get through it. And I'm
like, this is your legacy. Yes.

129
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:36,920
Why would you want to put
out a bad special ever?

130
00:07:36,921 --> 00:07:40,640
I don't care what they're paying you make
sure it's great. I feel the same way.

131
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:44,630
And I feel like those people that
watched that, when you do do that, man,

132
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:46,610
if you don't acknowledge
that you fucked him over,

133
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:50,150
they're never going to trust you
again. If you don't say, hey look,

134
00:07:50,151 --> 00:07:53,240
that one wasn't a good special. I
gave it a shot. It just wasn't right.

135
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:55,490
It didn't come out right.
I thought it was pretty good.

136
00:07:55,491 --> 00:07:59,000
And then the taping didn't go
well and if you don't do that,

137
00:07:59,001 --> 00:08:01,670
they're not going to listen to your man.
They were like, this is my best work.

138
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,530
Like this is, Oh, this
is your best work. Yeah,

139
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:07,750
well the fuck you can fool them
once. And I mean, like if I want,

140
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:11,480
