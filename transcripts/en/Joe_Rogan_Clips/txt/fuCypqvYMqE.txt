Speaker 1:          00:00          Can Hoist doesn't, you know, at this point when you compare, compare to these athletic guys and MMA today we saw it with Matt Hughes, you know, you know, he couldn't compete anymore. Um, once people sort of knew the tricks. But um, yeah, I mean that it's very humbling. The whole experience. Even crazier. Hixon hoists his brother voice will tell you he's 10 times better than him. Yeah. Hixon would do to hoists what hoists would do to other black belts. Well, wasn't that select the, uh, the story was they could have had Hixon but he was too athletic and two s, you know, there was a bunch of issues and I would not want to say exactly what happened for fear of upsetting either side, cause I think there's two different stories. Okay. But, uh, he was essentially the champion of the family. And one of the thoughts was that it would be a more impressive if hoist did it because her voice was only 175 pounds and with his shirt off and he looked like he was fit but look like a volleyball player or something.

Speaker 1:          00:57          Right. Whereas Hicks, like Freddie Mercury, Hickson was shredded. It takes him, was like really into physical training. He did a lot of gymnastics and yoga. He was unbelievably athletic. Yeah. But he was also like way physically stronger. It would appear more that he was just dominating some like a cat. He would jump on. So it wasn't as good of an advertisement for, it wasn't necessarily true though, because there was also talked that no one can control Hicks and it didn't want Hixon to win. Cause Hixon is a, he's like a free spirit, like in the greatest sense of the word. Like legitimately he might throw his phone in the ocean to disappear for a month and just fucking surf and do Jiu Jitsu somewhere. Oh he's, he's a freak in the best sense of the word. That's awesome. So I don't think they ever thought they could control Hixon that was part of the problem with having Hicks and be the champion.

Speaker 1:          01:40          Hixon would probably freeze up the whole organization. I want $10 million, I'll never fight again. Right. Like they were offering him fights for years and he had some crazy number that he wanted and he was like, if you give me that number, I'll fight for a door. If you give me that number, I'll fight the best fighters in the, Oh yeah, it's after. After the Oct, right? Yes. What after the UFC started, but everybody's still knew. See when hoists was winning, everyone's still new. Hickson was competing in something called Japan Valley Tudo and one that you have to see the super high level Jujitsu pride. One was Hixon, um, and uh, Hickson was the guy that everybody knew that if something happened and then hoists was out of the UFC or there was no other, uh, Gracie's in the UFC, Hixon is always there to step in. And we were always wondering, when is he gonna step down? When's it gonna Fight? The best guys never did. No, he fought. He fought foo knocky who was a really high level guy that was his last fight and he strangled him, uh, put them to sleep. It's crazy image man of him. Rear naked, choke, finicky, and for Nike's eyes roll in the back of his head and he goes unconscious and Hickson just throws him off.
