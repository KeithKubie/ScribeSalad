00:00:00.367 --> 00:00:02.234
The answer is the second one. We need to be

00:00:02.234 --> 00:00:05.388
able to unravel the layers of encryption as we pass

00:00:05.388 --> 00:00:08.336
the vote through the network. So that means we

00:00:08.336 --> 00:00:11.188
need the last step to be encrypted with the public

00:00:11.188 --> 00:00:14.272
key of C so C can decrypt and then get the actual

00:00:14.272 --> 00:00:17.188
vote. The previous step should be encrypted with

00:00:17.188 --> 00:00:19.395
the public key of V, and the first step should be

00:00:19.395 --> 00:00:22.000
encrypted with the public key of A.
