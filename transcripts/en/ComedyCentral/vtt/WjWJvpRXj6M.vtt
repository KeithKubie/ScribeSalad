00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:02.536
The Democratic National
Convention

00:00:02.569 --> 00:00:04.638
is at the end of next month,
which means

00:00:04.671 --> 00:00:06.740
Hillary Clinton is running out
of time to accomplish

00:00:06.773 --> 00:00:08.141
two important goals.
Number one--

00:00:08.175 --> 00:00:09.743
find an outfit
that doesn't make her look

00:00:09.776 --> 00:00:12.646
like Gary Oldman's character
from <i>The Fifth Element.</i>

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:15.382
-(laughter)
-BREWSTER: Aw.

00:00:15.415 --> 00:00:17.451
-And...
-(applause)

00:00:17.484 --> 00:00:20.053
Number two--

00:00:20.087 --> 00:00:25.192
win ancient snow crab
Bernie Sanders over to her side.

00:00:25.225 --> 00:00:27.361
That's why the two of them
got together on Tuesday

00:00:27.394 --> 00:00:29.496
to learn what it would take
to get his endorsement.

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:31.498
Here he is trying

00:00:31.532 --> 00:00:33.166
to get more packets of creamer
for his coffee.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.502
This is all a very private,
casual affair.

00:00:35.536 --> 00:00:37.304
Hillary ordered a pint of beer,

00:00:37.337 --> 00:00:41.808
and Bernie ordered his favorite
cocktail-- Gas-X on a Beach.

00:00:41.842 --> 00:00:44.444
But hopefully, they sort of
came to an agreement?

00:00:44.478 --> 00:00:46.146
Such as... (as Bernie):
"I'll endorse Hillary

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.315
"if she promises
a $15 minimum wage, or

00:00:48.348 --> 00:00:50.250
"I'll endorse Hillary if
she brings me a elixir of life

00:00:50.284 --> 00:00:52.486
that allows me
to live through the convention."

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:54.621
So comedians, what are
some other possible concessions

00:00:54.655 --> 00:00:56.723
that came out of their secret
Tuesday meeting?

00:00:56.757 --> 00:00:59.026
-Paul F. -Hillary agrees
to attend <i>Hamilton</i>

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:01.161
and describe it to Bernie.

00:01:01.195 --> 00:01:02.863
(laughter and groaning)

00:01:02.896 --> 00:01:05.365
-Points. Points. Paget.
-BREWSTER: Oh!

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:07.968
Hillary and Bernie
will part brokenhearted,

00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:10.237
but they will agree
to meet a year later

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.539
at the top
of the Empire State Building.

00:01:12.573 --> 00:01:14.975
-(laughter, applause)
-You're a gentleman.

00:01:15.008 --> 00:01:15.075
Just a game.
