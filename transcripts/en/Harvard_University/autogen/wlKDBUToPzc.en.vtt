all that the users finger and we can

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950
all that the users finger and we can
 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.430
all that the users finger and we can
specify whether the knuckles are where

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440
specify whether the knuckles are where
 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.140

the bending parts were the extending

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150
the bending parts were the extending
 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.570
the bending parts were the extending
parts and even for the thumb when we

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580
parts and even for the thumb when we
 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.520
parts and even for the thumb when we
have a much more complex motion where

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530
have a much more complex motion where

place I think it's wonderful it's really

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450
place I think it's wonderful it's really
 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.890
place I think it's wonderful it's really
comfortable if anything it feels good to

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900
comfortable if anything it feels good to
 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.020

have it on it feels nice to have my

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030
have it on it feels nice to have my
 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.780
have it on it feels nice to have my
fingers extended but most of all it's

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790
fingers extended but most of all it's
 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.600

again it's just wonderful to be able to
 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.400
again it's just wonderful to be able to
firmly grasp something and not feel like

I'm going to drop it going forward I
 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:50.729
I'm going to drop it going forward I
think it's going to be how do we make

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739
think it's going to be how do we make
 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:52.289
think it's going to be how do we make
this device smaller how do we make an

this device smaller how do we make an
 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:53.970
this device smaller how do we make an
even lighter and how do we have it like

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980
even lighter and how do we have it like
 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.559
even lighter and how do we have it like
