00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.770
The next step is to establish the key
performance indicators, or KPIs,

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:06.050
for your business.

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:08.510
This is an important step for
you to monitor and

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:12.290
understand how your company's
monetization plan is performing.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:19.030
&gt;&gt; In successful companies like it does
it in Google, we love data in numbers.

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:22.180
The main reason is that with
regard to monetization,

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.020
numbers give a clear picture
on where you're standing.

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:31.410
Numbers will tell a real, true story,
no excuses or emotion here.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.840
All you need to do is listen and act.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.250
If the numbers show that you are not
going up and to the right, but

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.320
rather decline,
you need to take action fast.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.340
However, you can only do it
if you have meaningful KPIs

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.560
that you are constantly measure.

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:51.251
We are not saying that all month will
be positive in terms of monetization.

00:00:51.251 --> 00:00:52.007
In fact for

00:00:52.007 --> 00:00:56.332
every startup there are many weeks
where you encounter major problems.

00:00:56.332 --> 00:00:58.540
What distinguish
successful entrepreneurs,

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.370
is the way they deal with
those issues and problems.

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.730
&gt;&gt; So, how can you increase your odds
of building a sustainable business?

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:10.310
&gt;&gt; It's a fact that both luck and timing
play a role, but you can improve your

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.100
odds with good planning, and the agility
to maneuver when things change.
