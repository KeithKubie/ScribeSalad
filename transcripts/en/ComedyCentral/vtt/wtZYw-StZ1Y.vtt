00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:01.368
I'm not the kind of man

00:00:01.401 --> 00:00:03.536
who does things
the conventional way.

00:00:03.569 --> 00:00:05.338
When I get jury duty,
I say I'm sick.

00:00:05.371 --> 00:00:08.574
And when I pay my taxes,
I do not pay my taxes.

00:00:08.607 --> 00:00:10.109
(laughter)

00:00:10.142 --> 00:00:13.346
That's why I was so happy
about Tuesday's primary results.

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:16.215
It was wall-to-wall victories
for outsider candidates,

00:00:16.248 --> 00:00:19.185
those brave politicians
well beyond the mainstream

00:00:19.218 --> 00:00:21.821
who don't know the meaning
of "bipartisan"

00:00:21.854 --> 00:00:24.257
or most other words.

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:25.725
(laughter)

00:00:25.758 --> 00:00:29.195
Opposers, let's look
at some of these new names

00:00:29.228 --> 00:00:31.030
in the political arena.

00:00:31.063 --> 00:00:34.133
Welcome to Fringe Watch 2018.

00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:36.269 line:0%
Too fringe,
too far to the extreme.

00:00:36.302 --> 00:00:39.205 line:0%
Fringe and extreme-- that's
kind of mainstream America now.

00:00:39.238 --> 00:00:40.540 line:0%
(distorted):
Fringe...

00:00:40.573 --> 00:00:42.275 line:0%
(braying, trumpeting)

00:00:42.308 --> 00:00:45.445 line:0%
(rattling, grunting, chirping)

00:00:48.547 --> 00:00:50.850 line:0%
-(cheering, applause)
-Whoa! Whoa!

00:00:53.419 --> 00:00:56.489 line:0%
That gorilla's actually running
for Topeka comptroller.

00:00:56.522 --> 00:00:57.990 line:0%
(laughter)

00:00:58.023 --> 00:01:00.726
Opposers, we're here to salute
the fringe candidates,

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:02.662
those antiestablishment beasts

00:01:02.695 --> 00:01:05.431
climbing into the ring
that is American politics.

00:01:05.464 --> 00:01:09.001
First up, weighing in
at zero legislative experience,

00:01:09.034 --> 00:01:12.605
he's a candidate
for Nevada's state legislature--

00:01:12.638 --> 00:01:14.040
Dennis Hof.

00:01:14.073 --> 00:01:15.808
-(bell clangs)
-No.

00:01:15.841 --> 00:01:19.645
Nevada voters just nominated Hof
as the GOP contender,

00:01:19.678 --> 00:01:22.081
and it's easy to see why--
he has a nuanced,

00:01:22.114 --> 00:01:26.018
comprehensive fiscal policy
known as being...

00:01:26.051 --> 00:01:29.122 line:0%
A pimp who calls himself
"The Trump of Pahrump"

00:01:29.155 --> 00:01:32.725 line:0%
wins the Republican primary for
the Nevada state legislature.

00:01:32.758 --> 00:01:35.428 line:0%
Dennis Hof,
who owns several brothels

00:01:35.461 --> 00:01:38.030 line:0%
<i> in the state and stars
 in the HBO reality series,</i>

00:01:38.063 --> 00:01:41.367 line:0%
Cathouse,<i> takes pride

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.303 line:0%
<i> even writing a book called</i>
 The Art of the Pimp.

00:01:44.336 --> 00:01:46.272
-Oh-ho!
-(laughter)

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.442
<i> The Art of the Pimp.</i>

00:01:49.475 --> 00:01:51.377
It's like<i> The Art of the Deal,</i>

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.713
but slightly more
respectful to women.

00:01:53.746 --> 00:01:55.781
-(laughter, whooping)
-Uh...

00:01:55.814 --> 00:01:57.583
Yes. Just a little bit.

00:01:57.616 --> 00:01:58.985
I love Hof.

00:01:59.018 --> 00:02:01.320
Just watch
this Republican nominee at work.

00:02:01.353 --> 00:02:03.489 line:0%
Want me to walk you around
and show you everything?

00:02:03.522 --> 00:02:05.024 line:0%
-Yeah, yeah.
-There's just rooms down here,

00:02:05.057 --> 00:02:07.393 line:0%
and the girls decorate them
like they want.

00:02:07.426 --> 00:02:09.428 line:0%
Yeah, we want people
to be comfortable.

00:02:09.461 --> 00:02:11.330 line:0%
LED plasma TVs.

00:02:11.363 --> 00:02:13.499 line:0%
Yeah, it looks just like
a regular bedroom.

00:02:13.532 --> 00:02:15.868 line:0%
-What is this?
-This is a swing.

00:02:15.901 --> 00:02:19.272 line:0%
I don't quite know, um...
how this works.

00:02:19.305 --> 00:02:21.207
(audience groans)

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.343
Incidentally, "I don't know,
um, how this works"

00:02:24.376 --> 00:02:26.746
is also Hof's campaign slogan.

00:02:26.779 --> 00:02:29.849
(laughter)

00:02:29.882 --> 00:02:32.985
Still, the question
on everyone's mind is:

00:02:33.018 --> 00:02:36.322
Can a candidate who treats
women's bodies as commodities

00:02:36.355 --> 00:02:38.991
fit in with today's GOP?

00:02:39.024 --> 00:02:42.328
(laughter)

00:02:42.361 --> 00:02:43.763
Yes.

00:02:43.796 --> 00:02:44.997
(laughter)

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.900
Because Hof is all in on Trump.

00:02:47.933 --> 00:02:51.204
When describing how the
president inspired him to run,

00:02:51.237 --> 00:02:54.540
Hof said Trump "found the way
and I jumped on it."

00:02:54.573 --> 00:02:58.277
And that Donald Trump was
"the Christopher Columbus."

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.914
Yeah. Trump and Columbus
are the same.

00:03:01.947 --> 00:03:05.318
Brave pioneers who know
that to achieve greatness,

00:03:05.351 --> 00:03:09.288
sometimes you've got to evict
the current residents.

00:03:09.321 --> 00:03:13.292
So, we've got a pimp who
idolizes a former reality host

00:03:13.325 --> 00:03:16.395
running to make laws for a state
where you can contract syphilis

00:03:16.428 --> 00:03:18.464
just by flying over it.

00:03:18.497 --> 00:03:20.066
(laughter)

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:21.934
That's some good fringe.

00:03:21.967 --> 00:03:25.938
But like I told my tailor,
I think we can go even fringier.

00:03:25.971 --> 00:03:28.741
(laughter)

00:03:28.774 --> 00:03:30.743
Yeah, that wasn't enough.

00:03:30.776 --> 00:03:32.311
Stepping into the ring now,

00:03:32.344 --> 00:03:33.713
standing at a towering

00:03:33.746 --> 00:03:36.816
six foot "I will ruin
your family's Thanksgiving,"

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:39.585
it's the winner of Virginia's
Republican Senate primary,

00:03:39.618 --> 00:03:41.320
-Corey Stewart.
-(bell clangs)

00:03:41.353 --> 00:03:43.589
Yes, now, this hunk of red meat

00:03:43.622 --> 00:03:46.092
crushed his mainstream opponents
in the primary.

00:03:46.125 --> 00:03:49.695
So of course, the CNN-dinistas
are complaining about him.

00:03:49.728 --> 00:03:51.597 line:0%
Stewart is known
for his championing

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.432 line:0%
of Confederate symbols
and his ties

00:03:53.465 --> 00:03:56.302 line:0%
to several unrepentant bigots,
including organizers

00:03:56.335 --> 00:03:59.839 line:0%
and participants in the
Charlottesville rally last year.

00:03:59.872 --> 00:04:01.007
Oh, okay.

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.441
That's a big charge.

00:04:02.474 --> 00:04:04.610
It's not his fault
he's getting support

00:04:04.643 --> 00:04:07.046
from the tiki torch
and khaki coalition.

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:08.314
(laughter)

00:04:08.347 --> 00:04:12.285
They support lots of Republicans
for some reason.

00:04:12.318 --> 00:04:14.553
And what's Stewart supposed
to do about it?

00:04:14.586 --> 00:04:16.622
Spit in the face
of his supporters?

00:04:16.655 --> 00:04:18.624
He can't.
They're wearing hoods.

00:04:18.657 --> 00:04:20.559
(laughter, groans)

00:04:20.592 --> 00:04:22.461
I mean, come on.

00:04:22.494 --> 00:04:26.032
Stewart can't be that bad a guy.

00:04:26.065 --> 00:04:28.834
In fact, President Trump
endorsed Stewart,

00:04:28.867 --> 00:04:31.671
saying that he has
a good chance at winning.

00:04:31.704 --> 00:04:34.040
Let me show you how unfairly
Stewart's being treated.

00:04:34.073 --> 00:04:36.375
Last year,
he praised Paul Nehlen,

00:04:36.408 --> 00:04:38.644
a self-professed
"pro-white" candidate,

00:04:38.677 --> 00:04:41.747
for Congress
as his "personal hero."

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.383
Now, is Paul Nehlen
a white supremacist?

00:04:44.416 --> 00:04:47.386
Technically, definitely.

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:50.489
But Stewart has since
disavowed Nehlen,

00:04:50.522 --> 00:04:52.425
which explains
the old expression:

00:04:52.458 --> 00:04:54.527
never meet your heroes...

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.230
especially if all your heroes
are white supremacists.

00:04:58.263 --> 00:05:01.500
Okay, the ring is filled
to the brim with fringe.

00:05:01.533 --> 00:05:03.169
But, my God.

00:05:03.202 --> 00:05:04.603
What's this?

00:05:04.636 --> 00:05:07.907
We have an unexpected challenger
entering the ring?

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:10.943
-And it's a Democrat.
-(bell rings)

00:05:10.976 --> 00:05:12.411
Okay, wow. Okay.

00:05:12.444 --> 00:05:15.514
Opposers, normally Fringewatch
is just for the right.

00:05:15.547 --> 00:05:18.150
But once in a while,
a liberal breaks through

00:05:18.183 --> 00:05:19.819
and earns their stripes.

00:05:19.852 --> 00:05:22.521
I present to you Colorado
congressional hopeful,

00:05:22.554 --> 00:05:24.223
Levi Tillemann.

00:05:24.256 --> 00:05:25.825
I'm Levi Tillemann.

00:05:25.858 --> 00:05:29.228
I'm calling on congress to stop
talking past each other

00:05:29.261 --> 00:05:31.263
and try something new.

00:05:31.296 --> 00:05:33.366
Empower schools and teachers

00:05:33.399 --> 00:05:36.068
with non-lethal
self-defense tools,

00:05:36.101 --> 00:05:38.204
like this can of pepper spray.

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:42.341 line:0%
(laughter)

00:05:42.374 --> 00:05:44.009
(gasps)

00:05:44.042 --> 00:05:46.045
It's incredibly painful.

00:05:46.078 --> 00:05:47.713
It's just unbearable.

00:05:47.746 --> 00:05:49.882
It's like lava in your eyes.

00:05:49.915 --> 00:05:52.885
(laughing)

00:05:52.918 --> 00:05:55.488
Now, that's my kind of Democrat.

00:05:55.521 --> 00:05:57.523
(laughter)

00:05:57.556 --> 00:06:02.094
The kind who will pepper spray
a Democrat.

00:06:02.127 --> 00:06:05.064
All right,
so I gather Levi was trying

00:06:05.097 --> 00:06:07.733
to promote non-gun solutions
to school violence.

00:06:07.766 --> 00:06:10.136
And, obviously, I hate that,
because the only real answer

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:12.304
is "good guy with a gun,"
et cetera.

00:06:12.337 --> 00:06:14.440
But I've got to see more
of this guy.

00:06:14.473 --> 00:06:15.841
I don't care if he's
progressive.

00:06:15.874 --> 00:06:18.711
I love watching Democrats
shoot themselves in the foot,

00:06:18.744 --> 00:06:22.381
and Levi seems like he might
actually do that.

00:06:22.414 --> 00:06:24.884
So, Levi, buddy, I can't wait

00:06:24.917 --> 00:06:26.986
for you to promote
a higher minimum wage

00:06:27.019 --> 00:06:28.954
by clamping mousetraps
on your nipples,

00:06:28.987 --> 00:06:31.991
or...
fight for immigration reform

00:06:32.024 --> 00:06:34.627
by locking yourself in a
<i> Saw-style trap</i>

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:37.463
where the key is surgically
implanted behind your left eye.

00:06:37.496 --> 00:06:39.165
I mean, I'm excited about
the new direction

00:06:39.198 --> 00:06:40.666
of the Democratic party.

00:06:40.699 --> 00:06:42.001
And that direction?

00:06:42.034 --> 00:06:43.602
Careening into the Grand Canyon,

00:06:43.635 --> 00:06:46.806
attempting to make a point about
corporate personhood.

00:06:46.839 --> 00:06:49.475
These leaders are inspiring,
but you know what?

00:06:49.508 --> 00:06:51.911
We can do fringer.

00:06:51.944 --> 00:06:55.314
That's why... I'm calling
on you, at home,

00:06:55.347 --> 00:06:57.249
-to take on the mainstream.
-(patriotic music plays)

00:06:57.282 --> 00:07:00.052
Are you an unlicensed
sea captain living on a boat

00:07:00.085 --> 00:07:02.555
that we could gerrymander
into a state?

00:07:02.588 --> 00:07:04.056
Join us.

00:07:04.089 --> 00:07:06.058
Are you the last living
Civil War general

00:07:06.091 --> 00:07:08.227
who is somehow still alive?

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.129
Saddle up, partner.

00:07:10.162 --> 00:07:12.631
Are you a Bible that bumped into
a genie's lamp

00:07:12.664 --> 00:07:14.266
and gained the power of speech?

00:07:14.299 --> 00:07:16.469
Well, welcome aboard.

00:07:16.502 --> 00:07:17.870
Get out there, Opposers.

00:07:17.903 --> 00:07:20.039
Way, way the (bleep) out there.
