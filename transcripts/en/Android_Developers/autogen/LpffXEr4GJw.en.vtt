00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:03.210
it now has a valid angry fruit bearer
token belonging to our poor unsuspecting

00:13:03.210 --> 00:13:03.220
token belonging to our poor unsuspecting
 

00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:05.340
token belonging to our poor unsuspecting
player and we don't want that to happen

00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:05.350
player and we don't want that to happen
 

00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:08.730
player and we don't want that to happen
so instead what we do is google keeps a

00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:08.740
so instead what we do is google keeps a
 

00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:11.310
so instead what we do is google keeps a
database of all client IDs along with

00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:11.320
database of all client IDs along with
 

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:13.770
database of all client IDs along with
all redirect URIs that are allowed to be

00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:13.780
all redirect URIs that are allowed to be
 

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:16.410
all redirect URIs that are allowed to be
associated with this client ID so in

00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:16.420
associated with this client ID so in
 

00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:18.180
associated with this client ID so in
this case my angry fruit game has a

00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:18.190
this case my angry fruit game has a
 

00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:20.520
this case my angry fruit game has a
client ID and we've set up a redirect

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:20.530
client ID and we've set up a redirect
 

00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:21.480
client ID and we've set up a redirect
URI that point

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:21.490
URI that point
 

00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:24.990
URI that point
to example.com / o auth to call back so

00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:25.000
to example.com / o auth to call back so
 

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.730
to example.com / o auth to call back so
now when scammy games makes this request

00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:26.740
now when scammy games makes this request
 

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:28.680
now when scammy games makes this request
Google will notice that it's got a

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:28.690
Google will notice that it's got a
 

00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:30.780
Google will notice that it's got a
client ID that matches something in our

client ID that matches something in our
 

00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:32.730
client ID that matches something in our
database but it will also notice that

database but it will also notice that
 

00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:35.760
database but it will also notice that
the redirect URI does not match and it

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:35.770
the redirect URI does not match and it
 

00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:38.040
the redirect URI does not match and it
will deny this request and scammy games

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:38.050
will deny this request and scammy games
 

00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:40.230
will deny this request and scammy games
will not be able to grab a valid angry

00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:40.240
will not be able to grab a valid angry
 

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:43.980
will not be able to grab a valid angry
fruit access token so at this point I

00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:43.990
fruit access token so at this point I
 

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:45.360
fruit access token so at this point I
know we've been talking a lot about web

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:45.370
know we've been talking a lot about web
 

00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:47.340
know we've been talking a lot about web
games but I know that we're making an

00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:47.350
games but I know that we're making an
 

00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:49.530
games but I know that we're making an
iOS game so what does this look like in

00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:49.540
iOS game so what does this look like in
 

00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:51.800
iOS game so what does this look like in
the mobile world it's pretty similar

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:51.810
the mobile world it's pretty similar
 

00:13:51.810 --> 00:13:54.269
the mobile world it's pretty similar
except that instead of a request that

difference and one that might surprise

difference and one that might surprise
 

00:14:46.959 --> 00:14:49.170
difference and one that might surprise
you is that you might expect that since

you is that you might expect that since

be doing the past the access token as a
URL fragment trick and indeed in many

00:14:56.850 --> 00:14:56.860
URL fragment trick and indeed in many
 

00:14:56.860 --> 00:14:58.980
URL fragment trick and indeed in many
situations on mobile devices this is

00:14:58.980 --> 00:14:58.990
situations on mobile devices this is
 

00:14:58.990 --> 00:15:01.170
situations on mobile devices this is
what happens but in our case we don't do

00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:01.180
what happens but in our case we don't do
 

00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:03.420
what happens but in our case we don't do
that we're actually going to pass in a

00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:03.430
that we're actually going to pass in a
 

00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:06.449
that we're actually going to pass in a
single use code but wait you're saying

00:15:06.449 --> 00:15:06.459
single use code but wait you're saying
 

00:15:06.459 --> 00:15:08.130
single use code but wait you're saying
we don't want to pass a single use code

00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:08.140
we don't want to pass a single use code
 

00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:10.079
we don't want to pass a single use code
right because in order to exchange that

00:15:10.079 --> 00:15:10.089
right because in order to exchange that
 

00:15:10.089 --> 00:15:12.180
right because in order to exchange that
we need to pass along our client secret

00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:12.190
we need to pass along our client secret
 

00:15:12.190 --> 00:15:13.829
we need to pass along our client secret
and you told us that it's a really bad

00:15:13.829 --> 00:15:13.839
and you told us that it's a really bad
 

00:15:13.839 --> 00:15:15.690
and you told us that it's a really bad
idea to store a client secret on a

00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:15.700
idea to store a client secret on a
 

00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:18.810
idea to store a client secret on a
client device what's up with that well

00:15:18.810 --> 00:15:18.820
client device what's up with that well
 

00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:21.780
client device what's up with that well
it turns out that when we exchange a

00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:21.790
it turns out that when we exchange a
 

00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:24.750
it turns out that when we exchange a
code for a token using a client ID that

00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:24.760
code for a token using a client ID that
 

00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:26.639
code for a token using a client ID that
we know is associated with a mobile

00:15:26.639 --> 00:15:26.649
we know is associated with a mobile
 

00:15:26.649 --> 00:15:28.560
we know is associated with a mobile
device we actually don't need to use the

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:28.570
device we actually don't need to use the
 

00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:30.930
device we actually don't need to use the
client secret this might seem like we're

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:30.940
client secret this might seem like we're
 

00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:32.340
client secret this might seem like we're
losing a little bit of security right

00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:32.350
losing a little bit of security right
 

00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:34.199
losing a little bit of security right
since anybody that intercepts our code

00:15:34.199 --> 00:15:34.209
since anybody that intercepts our code
 

00:15:34.209 --> 00:15:34.920
since anybody that intercepts our code
might be able to

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:34.930
might be able to
 

00:15:34.930 --> 00:15:36.750
might be able to
use it but you have to remember that now

00:15:36.750 --> 00:15:36.760
use it but you have to remember that now
 

00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:38.820
use it but you have to remember that now
we're redirecting to another local

00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:38.830
we're redirecting to another local
 

00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:41.910
we're redirecting to another local
application on the device instead of say

00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:41.920
application on the device instead of say
 

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:43.769
application on the device instead of say
another web page out there in the world

00:15:43.769 --> 00:15:43.779
another web page out there in the world
 

00:15:43.779 --> 00:15:46.470
another web page out there in the world
and that's considerably more secure so

00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:46.480
and that's considerably more secure so
 

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:48.570
and that's considerably more secure so
this all generally works out in our

00:15:48.570 --> 00:15:48.580
this all generally works out in our
 

00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:50.519
this all generally works out in our
favor and we're able to get an access

00:15:50.519 --> 00:15:50.529
favor and we're able to get an access
 

00:15:50.529 --> 00:15:54.090
favor and we're able to get an access
token back from our servers so now that

00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:54.100
token back from our servers so now that
 

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:55.470
token back from our servers so now that
we hopefully understand a little more

00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:55.480
we hopefully understand a little more
 

00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:57.600
we hopefully understand a little more
about the OAuth 2 point 0 process and

00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:57.610
about the OAuth 2 point 0 process and
 

00:15:57.610 --> 00:15:59.790
about the OAuth 2 point 0 process and
this tutorial hasn't confused you more

00:15:59.790 --> 00:15:59.800
this tutorial hasn't confused you more
 

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:01.860
this tutorial hasn't confused you more
than it's helped let's get started by

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:01.870
than it's helped let's get started by
 

00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:03.810
than it's helped let's get started by
creating our very own client ID and

00:16:03.810 --> 00:16:03.820
creating our very own client ID and
 

00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:15.020
creating our very own client ID and
we'll be doing that in the next lesson

00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:15.030
 

00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:17.420
haha
