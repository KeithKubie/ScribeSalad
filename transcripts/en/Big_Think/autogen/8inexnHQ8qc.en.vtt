corporate life and what we know is that
 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.850 align:start position:0%
corporate life and what we know is that
big<00:00:45.270><c> corporates</c><00:00:45.660><c> are</c><00:00:45.780><c> very</c><00:00:46.020><c> powerful</c><00:00:46.530><c> they</c>

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 align:start position:0%
big corporates are very powerful they
 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.250 align:start position:0%
big corporates are very powerful they
control<00:00:47.610><c> an</c><00:00:48.000><c> enormous</c><00:00:48.570><c> a</c><00:00:48.719><c> number</c><00:00:49.050><c> of</c>

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 align:start position:0%
control an enormous a number of
 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.799 align:start position:0%
control an enormous a number of
resources<00:00:49.760><c> human</c><00:00:50.760><c> and</c><00:00:50.940><c> Planetary</c><00:00:51.539><c> Resources</c>

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 align:start position:0%
resources human and Planetary Resources
 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.319 align:start position:0%
resources human and Planetary Resources
and<00:00:52.559><c> so</c><00:00:53.160><c> the</c><00:00:53.309><c> transformation</c><00:00:53.550><c> of</c><00:00:54.059><c> big</c>

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 align:start position:0%
and so the transformation of big
 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.180 align:start position:0%
and so the transformation of big
companies<00:00:54.570><c> is</c><00:00:55.020><c> a</c><00:00:55.050><c> really</c><00:00:55.440><c> important</c><00:00:55.860><c> part</c><00:00:56.039><c> of</c>

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 align:start position:0%
companies is a really important part of
 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.180 align:start position:0%
companies is a really important part of
the<00:00:56.340><c> puzzle</c><00:00:56.550><c> it's</c><00:00:57.420><c> not</c><00:00:57.660><c> the</c><00:00:57.809><c> only</c><00:00:58.110><c> thing</c><00:00:58.350><c> but</c>

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 align:start position:0%
the puzzle it's not the only thing but
 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.470 align:start position:0%
the puzzle it's not the only thing but
it's<00:00:59.340><c> a</c><00:00:59.489><c> really</c><00:00:59.640><c> important</c><00:01:00.120><c> part</c><00:01:00.329><c> of</c><00:01:00.390><c> the</c>

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 align:start position:0%
it's a really important part of the
 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.639 align:start position:0%
it's a really important part of the
puzzle<00:01:00.870><c> so</c><00:01:01.770><c> I</c><00:01:02.129><c> think</c><00:01:02.489><c> that</c><00:01:03.000><c> the</c><00:01:03.870><c> more</c><00:01:04.110><c> that</c><00:01:04.350><c> big</c>

00:01:04.639 --> 00:01:04.649 align:start position:0%
puzzle so I think that the more that big
 

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:07.399 align:start position:0%
puzzle so I think that the more that big
companies<00:01:04.979><c> take</c><00:01:05.489><c> their</c><00:01:06.420><c> responsibilities</c>

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 align:start position:0%
companies take their responsibilities
 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.130 align:start position:0%
companies take their responsibilities
seriously<00:01:07.680><c> to</c><00:01:08.189><c> transform</c><00:01:08.850><c> the</c><00:01:09.659><c> better</c><00:01:09.900><c> off</c>

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 align:start position:0%
seriously to transform the better off
 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.370 align:start position:0%
seriously to transform the better off
the<00:01:10.409><c> entire</c><00:01:10.680><c> puzzle</c><00:01:11.220><c> is</c><00:01:11.430><c> going</c><00:01:11.820><c> to</c><00:01:11.939><c> be</c><00:01:12.119><c> I</c><00:01:12.380><c> think</c>
