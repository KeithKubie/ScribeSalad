00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.200
This is looking at search traffic, the mobile
search traffic that hits Google.

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.150
And if you look at the proportion that comes
from HTML5-capable browsers, it's far outpacing

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.990
the other browsers as well.
So HTML5 is everywhere.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.730
So the question is, how do we make use of
it?

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.830
How do we all make use of it to create amazing
experiences for users?

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:26.009
So I want to show you a few examples.
I'm going to start with a demo from Google.

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:31.019
I'm going to invite Jeff Chang, who's a product
manager on the Chrome team, to give you a

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:38.100
demo of GMail, how GMail is has built two
simple yet powerful features on top of HTML5.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.809
So let's get started.
So Jeff is loading GMail.

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:47.310
It turns out, one of the most popular features
in GMail is sending e-mail.

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:51.050
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Sundar Pichai: And most people tend to attach

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.699
files when they do that.
If you're using a traditional desktop application

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:58.199
like outlook, it's very intuitive.
You just drag and drop a file.

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:04.309
That's been hard for Web applications to do.
But now, using the HTML5 file APIs, he can

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.260
drag that photo very intuitively and just
drop it in GMail.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:13.260
Simple, but very powerful.
What most users do in their day-to-day lives.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:19.690
A second such example is around notifications.
It's very common for you to be in a Web application

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:25.560
which has notifications associated with it.
For example, Google Chat is built into GMail.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.830
The question is, how do you receive that notification
when you are not on GMail?

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:35.670
So but now using the HTML5 notifications Gmail
 -- notifications API, Jeff can receive the

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.530
e-mail from Bob, I guess, even when he is
not on GMail.

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.780
So two examples.
The file API and notifications API, and GMail

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.860
is implementing to deliver powerful features
to our users.

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.640
So at this pointed, I would like to invite
 -- we want to show you real-world examples,

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.930
people all over the community building great
applications on top of HTML5.

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:06.560
So I would like to invite first Charles Pritchard
from MugTug, and Jim Lanzone from Clicker.com.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:20.010
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Charles Pritchard: Hello, everyone.

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.750
My name's Charles Pritchard.
I'm the CEO behind MugTug.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.859
I've come here to preview our latest software
development.

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:32.989
It's an application we call Darkroom.
In 2006, Michael Deal and I created an HTML

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:39.260
4 Web site called MugTug Studio.
It used cloud services to allow people to

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:45.390
edit their images, apply effects, et cetera.
It was slow, and it used a lot of bandwidth.

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:51.310
But now, this year, with HTML5 support growing,
we're able to bring MugTug Darkroom onto the

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.930
client side.
Now, when I say "client side," I mean that

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.909
we're untethered, we're not connected to the
Internet, or at least we don't need to be.

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:04.610
I'm going to go ahead and unplug and show
you that, indeed, we are offline, unless the

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:09.239
Wi-Fi, of course, picks up.
So we're offline.

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:13.640
And we are still in the cache.
The way this is done is by using some HTML5

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.780
APIs.
One of them is application cache.

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:23.219
We also use local storage and the file reader.
Our GUI is in canvas 2D context.

00:03:23.219 --> 00:03:28.469
So I'm going to go ahead, and I'm going to
start using the application.

00:03:28.469 --> 00:03:34.469
You can see here, we have a few beautiful
photos.

00:03:34.469 --> 00:03:36.680
And these are all being served from the local
computer.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.189
But what I'd like to do is go ahead and work
with one that hasn't been touched up yet.

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:46.340
That's going to be this one right here.
Experts amongst you will notice a few things

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.799
wrong with this photo.
It's tilted.

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:52.439
So I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to
apply our advanced rotate effect.

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:56.150
Very wild, I know.
And the next thing we're going to do here

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.680
is, you can tell that the camera flash has
brought out that infamous red eye effect.

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.459
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Charles Pritchard: So I'm going to go ahead

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:05.150
here, and I'm going to give him a much more
natural appearance.

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:12.349
It's much better, much better.
Anyway, what you do see here is the next generation

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:15.900
of application.
It's quick to load, quick to close, and quick

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.910
to use.
I'm previewing it on the latest Google Chrome,

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:26.140
which has great support for HTML5.
The application itself is using JavaScript,

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.140
and it's using the canvas 2D context for its
GUI.

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:34.570
We're going to see a lot more of these in
the future, because HTML5 support, offline

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:39.440
applications are being actively championed
by every major browser vendor.

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.760
Again, my name is Charles Pritchard.
This is MugTug Darkroom.

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:47.950
And I invited you to visit us in the sandbox
if you'd like some more information or if

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:52.780
you'd just like to play around with some of
the other image effects we have going on.

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:59.380
Thank you.
[ Applause ]

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:15.170
&gt;&gt;Jim Lanzone: So we launched Clicker.com
a few months ago, it's been called the TV

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:18.760
guide for the Web.
It's essentially a massive database, like

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:23.830
sites like Trip Advisor or Yelp.
But it's focused just on the premium programming

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:30.070
available on the Web across Web originals,
broadcast television, movie, music videos.

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:34.110
Because it's no longer about when things are
on or having a scheduled grid.

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:39.770
It's about where they're on and whether they're
on and what you can actually get across thousands

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:45.160
of different hosts of online video.
So we launched a few months ago, and a lot

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:50.330
of our users are actually just broadcasting
their PC screens up to their televisions or

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:53.990
using a Mac mini to do so.
And Clicker.com was definitely geared toward

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:56.580
the two-foot experience.
It's a Web site.

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:58.720
They've wanted to be able to use us in that
ten-foot experience.

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:03.210
We're here today to launch clicker.TV, which
is our ten-foot experience.

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:09.970
You see us kind of moving through T you'll
see it looks and feels a lot like a downloadable

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:13.260
application or a plug-in or something you
might have to buy a box to attach to your

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.610
TV.
But it's native to the browser.

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:22.080
You go to Clicker.TV to use it.
It does this thanks in part to HTML5, using

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:27.450
Canvas, Web worker threads, the local storage
API, and, of course, it really hums in a browser

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:29.480
like Chrome.
Even though it works in all browsers, it really

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:33.880
shines.
And you see the speed of this application.

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:36.570
We'll see -- let's go into, let's say, a show.
Start with "Charlie Rose."

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:41.770
That's an example I like to use.
And you'll see it appears, you don't have

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:51.050
to go to the search box.
Chrome likes to show itself off.

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:55.680
And you'll see all the Charlie Rose episodes
that have been online going back to 1994,

00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:00.250
all organized by season.
Another example, let's say with my kids I

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:04.830
want to watch this online show called "Pigeon
Impossible," which is a Pixar-like short.

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:14.980
I start typing "pigeon," hit it, and I get
to the actual show page.

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:23.580
Perhaps.
Like Bill Gates.

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:41.320
Just hit enter and I just hit play.
[ Music ]

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:50.490
&gt;&gt;Jim Lanzone: Let's say instead I want to
watch, actually, broadcast television.

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:53.590
We don't host all programming.
To be the TV guide of the Web, you have to

00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:58.440
be truly comprehensive and unbiased across
everything, even things you don't host.

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:02.790
Let's maybe, for example, go back to the home
page and try the show "lost."

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:08.610
I'm not sure how many of you were watching
that 12 hours ago, like I was, hoping finally

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:12.340
someone would ask a follow-up question.
I'm still waiting for that after six years.

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:17.070
Let's say we want to watch the episode that's
online.

00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:20.440
Again, just go to the show, hit enter, you
get to the show.

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:26.840
In this case, you're being taken to ABC's
Web site and it comes up large screen to play,

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:29.810
or you can hit full screen to get it all the
way there.

00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:34.180
But, again, very easy and on your keyboard
just hit the back space or delete button and

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:37.529
you get back to the programming guide.
Maybe because I don't want to watch the ad,

00:08:37.529 --> 00:08:42.399
I want to add it to my play list you see on
the left-hand side I can scroll down or add

00:08:42.399 --> 00:08:48.980
to my play list and then down the left-hand
side of the page, I can go into the play list

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:53.620
using the arrow keys or the configured remote.
You see all these shows I have saved.

00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:57.670
On our site here is "Deadliest Warrior."
If anyone has seen this show, it's ridiculous,

00:08:57.670 --> 00:09:00.519
like watching Alexander the Great square off
against Attila the Hun.

00:09:00.519 --> 00:09:06.269
So I've saved all these things.
You can also then browse 1400 categories in

00:09:06.269 --> 00:09:11.200
TV, movies, Web originals.
You can even sort by themes, kind of like

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:14.999
Pandora, like jeans, like, quirky characters
and things like that.

00:09:14.999 --> 00:09:20.209
And you see the movie page.
You can just go straight into Netflix, if

00:09:20.209 --> 00:09:25.959
you're a subscriber, to watch.
So that's Clicker.TV, again, purely native.

00:09:25.959 --> 00:09:31.850
You just go to that Web site, and very, very
rich, thanks in large patient to HTML5 and

00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:35.490
the guys at Chrome.
We are in the sandbox, and we'd love to see

00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:37.149
you guys there.
Thanks for having us.

00:09:37.149 --> 00:09:38.149
Have a great next couple of days.
Thanks.

00:09:38.149 --> 00:09:44.490
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Sundar Pichai: So it's great to see these

00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:52.139
applications.
We will have many more on the way.

00:09:52.139 --> 00:09:55.810
And these are all built on HTML5 and work
great in the browser.
