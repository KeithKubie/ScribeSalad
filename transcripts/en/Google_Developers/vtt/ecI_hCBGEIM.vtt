00:00:01.667 --> 00:00:04.634
Cutts: So if you have a site
that you want to throw up here--

00:00:04.634 --> 00:00:06.801
we got one on a piece of paper
just before the session--

00:00:06.801 --> 00:00:09.634
if you have a site, you know,
write it down, bring it on up.

00:00:09.634 --> 00:00:10.667
We'll be looking at it

00:00:10.667 --> 00:00:12.133
throughout the course
of this session.

00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:14.334
If we don't get to look
at your site,

00:00:14.334 --> 00:00:18.667
feel free to catch me
or Brian or Greg afterwards.

00:00:18.667 --> 00:00:20.968
So it's a good chance
to introduce, folks,

00:00:20.968 --> 00:00:22.834
Greg Grothaus, Brian White.

00:00:22.834 --> 00:00:25.834
We're all members of Google's
search-quality team.

00:00:25.834 --> 00:00:29.501
So our job is to make sure
that if you type in your name,

00:00:29.501 --> 00:00:31.300
you don't get porn back.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.300
Right?
Unless you're a porn star.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.968
If you're a porn star,
then you want to get porn back.

00:00:35.968 --> 00:00:38.701
But if you just type in,
you know,

00:00:38.701 --> 00:00:40.467
"iPod car"
or something like that,

00:00:40.467 --> 00:00:42.033
you want to get
a really relevant result.

00:00:42.033 --> 00:00:44.067
So without further ado,

00:00:44.067 --> 00:00:45.634
we're going to start
jumping right in.

00:00:45.634 --> 00:00:47.667
If you have a site
you'd like to get reviewed,

00:00:47.667 --> 00:00:49.601
again, just write it down,
bring it up.

00:00:49.601 --> 00:00:51.067
Brian or Greg
will start looking at it.

00:00:51.067 --> 00:00:52.868
I'll start looking at it.
Yeah, bring up a business card.

00:00:52.868 --> 00:00:55.601
Anything like that.

00:00:55.601 --> 00:00:57.634
Okay, cool.

00:00:57.634 --> 00:00:59.067
Excellent.
All right.

00:00:59.067 --> 00:01:00.834
And worst case,
we'll catch you afterwards.

00:01:00.834 --> 00:01:03.334
Okay, so this one
was kind of interesting.

00:01:03.334 --> 00:01:05.667
iCarKits.com.

00:01:05.667 --> 00:01:07.634
This was a submission
in advance.

00:01:07.634 --> 00:01:11.734
Is the owner of iCarKits
in the room?

00:01:11.734 --> 00:01:13.734
Excellent.
So I can be mean if I want to.

00:01:13.734 --> 00:01:15.367
I can be sarcastic
if I want to.

00:01:15.367 --> 00:01:16.667
There was some good stuff,

00:01:16.667 --> 00:01:18.467
and there was some bad stuff
about this site.

00:01:18.467 --> 00:01:20.000
Mostly good, though.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.367
When you look at it,

00:01:21.367 --> 00:01:23.667
what do you think
this site is about?

00:01:23.667 --> 00:01:27.968
What's the impression
that you get?

00:01:27.968 --> 00:01:31.100
They put iPod kits
in cars, right?

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.334
That's pretty clear.

00:01:32.334 --> 00:01:33.868
So it's a nice thing
that you know

00:01:33.868 --> 00:01:35.000
what does this site do.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.334
We'll look at a site or two
later on

00:01:36.334 --> 00:01:38.200
where it's like,
why does this site exist?

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.501
We're not quite sure.

00:01:39.501 --> 00:01:41.434
And in fact,
normally I do this

00:01:41.434 --> 00:01:44.834
at SEO--search engine
optimization--conferences.

00:01:44.834 --> 00:01:47.133
And I get a lot
of really bad ones.

00:01:47.133 --> 00:01:54.133
Like cheap-hotels-biz-discounts-
online-4you/viagra

00:01:54.133 --> 00:01:56.300
or something like that.

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.467
And all the submissions
were pretty much white hat,

00:01:58.467 --> 00:02:00.734
so I might throw in a few
spam results that we've seen,

00:02:00.734 --> 00:02:02.901
just to kind of spice it up
a little bit.

00:02:02.901 --> 00:02:04.734
Now, one thing
you might not notice:

00:02:04.734 --> 00:02:07.334
I'll bet whoever did
iCarKits.com

00:02:07.334 --> 00:02:11.100
is proud of the fact that--
do you see this little iPod?

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.734
That's actually active.

00:02:12.734 --> 00:02:14.167
It's searchable,

00:02:14.167 --> 00:02:17.734
which is kind of cute, but you
might not realize it, right?

00:02:17.734 --> 00:02:20.267
So let's pretend
I have an Audi.

00:02:20.267 --> 00:02:24.434
And let's pretend that I have,
you know, an Audi A4.

00:02:24.434 --> 00:02:25.834
So you can click through,

00:02:25.834 --> 00:02:27.467
you can pick
a random model year,

00:02:27.467 --> 00:02:29.801
and then for that,
do I have navigation?

00:02:29.801 --> 00:02:31.501
Sure, yeah, why not.
I've got navigation.

00:02:31.501 --> 00:02:34.701
For that, you can see
the products that you have.

00:02:34.701 --> 00:02:36.033
That's pretty cool.

00:02:36.033 --> 00:02:38.200
I haven't actually seen
that sort of active scroller

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.334
within a picture, right?

00:02:39.334 --> 00:02:41.334
That's kind of engaging.

00:02:41.334 --> 00:02:44.167
But do you think
an average user,

00:02:44.167 --> 00:02:46.901
who's not necessarily savvy,
who lands on that page

00:02:46.901 --> 00:02:49.234
knows to go looking
at the iPod?

00:02:49.234 --> 00:02:50.601
Probably not.

00:02:50.601 --> 00:02:52.567
So one of the things that we
always try to communicate

00:02:52.567 --> 00:02:55.067
is provide multiple ways
to get to a page.

00:02:55.067 --> 00:02:56.868
If you can have
drop-down boxes,

00:02:56.868 --> 00:02:58.901
these sort of clickable
search stuff,

00:02:58.901 --> 00:03:01.400
search engines might be able
to crawl through that.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.601
But it's really nice if you can
have static HTML links,

00:03:04.601 --> 00:03:07.234
because the crawler pretty much
only knows how to crawl

00:03:07.234 --> 00:03:08.667
through static HTML links.

00:03:08.667 --> 00:03:11.133
Now, Google actually
can read JavaScript.

00:03:11.133 --> 00:03:14.567
And not just stupid, look
for a URL in the JavaScript.

00:03:14.567 --> 00:03:16.667
We can sometimes click
and execute

00:03:16.667 --> 00:03:18.801
and try to do really neat things
with JavaScript.

00:03:18.801 --> 00:03:20.701
But not every search engine
can do that.

00:03:20.701 --> 00:03:23.267
You don't want to make it hard
for the search engines

00:03:23.267 --> 00:03:25.033
to get to your site, so you
don't want the search engine

00:03:25.033 --> 00:03:28.400
to have to fill out a form
to find these products.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.033
But once you land here,
it's actually pretty good.

00:03:31.033 --> 00:03:32.400
Now, one thing that I noticed--

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.300
you know, they've got
text phone numbers,

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:35.734
so that's kind of nice--

00:03:35.734 --> 00:03:38.400
a lot of people will put their
information in an image, right?

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.601
"Free shipping."

00:03:39.601 --> 00:03:41.567
See this "free shipping"?
That's an image.

00:03:41.567 --> 00:03:44.334
Unless you said "free shipping"
in the ALT tag,

00:03:44.334 --> 00:03:47.901
there's no way we can actually
read the content of that image.

00:03:47.901 --> 00:03:49.501
Now, there are people at Google
who have said,

00:03:49.501 --> 00:03:51.534
"We should OCR the entire Web."

00:03:51.534 --> 00:03:52.767
Right?

00:03:52.767 --> 00:03:54.067
We've talked about it, right?

00:03:54.067 --> 00:03:55.968
Google Books.
We do OCR our own stuff.

00:03:55.968 --> 00:03:58.634
It would be really cool
if we should OCR

00:03:58.634 --> 00:04:00.567
"free shipping," you know,
and "enter the discount code,"

00:04:00.567 --> 00:04:01.934
and you could index that.

00:04:01.934 --> 00:04:03.667
And then if somebody searched
for "iPod car kit,"

00:04:03.667 --> 00:04:05.501
with "free shipping,"
we might return that.

00:04:05.501 --> 00:04:08.567
But don't rely on search engines
to OCR the entire Web,

00:04:08.567 --> 00:04:10.234
'cause it doesn't happen
right now.

00:04:10.234 --> 00:04:11.968
It's not going to happen
anytime soon.

00:04:11.968 --> 00:04:14.000
So the more you can have
nice links,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.367
like here's the phone number
just in straight text,

00:04:16.367 --> 00:04:18.334
the better off that'll work.

00:04:18.334 --> 00:04:20.434
What else do you notice
about this?

00:04:20.434 --> 00:04:23.667
Anybody notice anything strange
about the URL?

00:04:26.267 --> 00:04:28.901
The URL is
"advanced_search_result.php?

00:04:28.901 --> 00:04:31.434
"set_questions=1
sort=4d

00:04:31.434 --> 00:04:35.300
&amp;search_question[7]=14."

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.133
That's a pretty hard URL
to crawl.

00:04:38.133 --> 00:04:40.734
If I were designing this site
from scratch,

00:04:40.734 --> 00:04:45.133
I would probably make it
iCarKits.com/products

00:04:45.133 --> 00:04:50.968
or catalog/audi/a4/2006, right?

00:04:50.968 --> 00:04:52.667
Because you can encode
all those parameters

00:04:52.667 --> 00:04:54.334
in a very nice way
that's sort of like

00:04:54.334 --> 00:04:56.834
a tree structure,
and anyone could click around.

00:04:56.834 --> 00:04:59.501
As long as you have
these sort of, you know,

00:04:59.501 --> 00:05:00.934
multiple parameters on the URL

00:05:00.934 --> 00:05:02.534
where it's almost
like search results,

00:05:02.534 --> 00:05:04.968
it's a lot harder for
search engines to get through

00:05:04.968 --> 00:05:06.734
and try to find
those sort of sites.

00:05:06.734 --> 00:05:08.467
Does that make sense?

00:05:08.467 --> 00:05:11.367
So if you can make something
like a very static,

00:05:11.367 --> 00:05:14.000
nicely crawlable link
or set of links,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.400
that's going to be
a lot more useful.

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:17.901
I don't want to dwell
on this one too long,

00:05:17.901 --> 00:05:19.400
but in general,
it's a pretty good site.

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.334
It's crawlable,
you can click around on links,

00:05:21.334 --> 00:05:22.834
and you can usually find stuff.

00:05:22.834 --> 00:05:24.534
And Google does
a pretty good job on it.

00:05:24.534 --> 00:05:27.267
But I did want to mention
one little tidbit.

00:05:27.267 --> 00:05:28.968
You're developers, right?

00:05:28.968 --> 00:05:30.334
How many people here
are responsible

00:05:30.334 --> 00:05:32.033
for a Website
or a blog in some way?

00:05:32.033 --> 00:05:34.167
A forum? Okay.

00:05:34.167 --> 00:05:36.133
Why do you run your Website?

00:05:38.634 --> 00:05:39.834
Say again?

00:05:39.834 --> 00:05:41.234
For people to look at it.

00:05:41.234 --> 00:05:42.400
Fair enough.

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.934
But why do you want them
to look at it?

00:05:43.934 --> 00:05:46.167
What do you want them--what do
you want them to get out of it?

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:51.801
To make money.
Exactly.

00:05:51.801 --> 00:05:53.467
This guy doesn't want
to educate the world

00:05:53.467 --> 00:05:56.100
about how to, you know,
install iPod car kits.

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.000
He wants to make money.
And that's okay.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.901
He can provide a great service
and great information.

00:06:00.901 --> 00:06:03.267
So ask yourself, what do you
want out of your Website?

00:06:03.267 --> 00:06:04.367
I happen to run a blog.

00:06:04.367 --> 00:06:05.634
I don't run any ads.

00:06:05.634 --> 00:06:08.067
I often ask myself,
"Why do I run my Website?"

00:06:08.067 --> 00:06:09.300
Like, what's the point?

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:10.701
I just throw stuff up there
on the Web.

00:06:10.701 --> 00:06:13.334
I don't get anybody
to subscribe to newsletters

00:06:13.334 --> 00:06:14.400
or anything like that.

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:15.567
So you should ask yourself,

00:06:15.567 --> 00:06:16.934
what are you trying to get out
of your Website?

00:06:16.934 --> 00:06:18.300
This guy
is trying to get sales.

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:20.200
If you look at the title
of the Website--

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:23.467
I'm gonna hover over it
in Chrome--

00:06:23.467 --> 00:06:26.434
iPod car adapters--
2006 Audi A6--

00:06:26.434 --> 00:06:28.067
This is pretty good.

00:06:28.067 --> 00:06:31.167
You notice he has the word
"iPod car."

00:06:31.167 --> 00:06:33.567
I would bet you
dollars to doughnuts

00:06:33.567 --> 00:06:36.234
that probably his top phrase
is "iPod car."

00:06:36.234 --> 00:06:38.334
A lot of people
who are caring about phrases,

00:06:38.334 --> 00:06:40.267
they'll put that right there
in their title.

00:06:40.267 --> 00:06:43.667
And I would probably bet you
that he is getting

00:06:43.667 --> 00:06:46.067
maybe hundreds of visitors
a day, which is pretty good.

00:06:46.067 --> 00:06:47.934
If you can get a few of those
to convert

00:06:47.934 --> 00:06:51.300
at, you know, 180 bucks a pop,
that's not bad.

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:52.734
But one thing I noticed
when I looked

00:06:52.734 --> 00:06:55.000
at this site last night
is he doesn't even mention

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.133
the most popular product
for the iPod and cars.

00:06:59.133 --> 00:07:01.334
So let's see if I can
bring it up.

00:07:01.334 --> 00:07:04.067
There's a Google AdWords tool,
and I'll warn you in advance

00:07:04.067 --> 00:07:06.534
that the Wi-Fi in this room
is a little bit spotty,

00:07:06.534 --> 00:07:09.234
so I tried to preload
as many tabs as I could.

00:07:09.234 --> 00:07:11.400
But if you go to this tool,
which you can just search for

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.834
with "Google AdWords tool"
or "Google keyword tool,"

00:07:14.834 --> 00:07:16.834
what it will let you do
is it will let you type in

00:07:16.834 --> 00:07:18.367
a phrase like "iPod car."

00:07:18.367 --> 00:07:20.267
And whenever I did that
last night,

00:07:20.267 --> 00:07:21.634
it said,
"You know what?

00:07:21.634 --> 00:07:24.200
People type in 'iPod car,'
like, 100 times a day."

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:28.501
What do you think they type in
250,000 times a day?

00:07:28.501 --> 00:07:30.367
There's a product called iTrip.

00:07:30.367 --> 00:07:31.767
It's from Griffin.

00:07:31.767 --> 00:07:33.667
And what it does is it turns
your iPhone

00:07:33.667 --> 00:07:35.300
into a little FM transmitter.

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:37.167
You know, it transmits
over the radio.

00:07:37.167 --> 00:07:39.567
The word--
It's starting to come up.

00:07:39.567 --> 00:07:42.934
The word "iTrip" does not appear
anywhere on this site.

00:07:42.934 --> 00:07:45.501
So if you're a developer,
if you care about making money,

00:07:45.501 --> 00:07:47.868
you know, do a little bit
of research.

00:07:47.868 --> 00:07:50.133
What are the words
that people are going to use

00:07:50.133 --> 00:07:51.601
to find your site?

00:07:51.601 --> 00:07:55.133
So I solve my little CAPTCHA.
I type in "iPod car."

00:07:55.133 --> 00:07:57.634
And eventually what it tells you
is, "Hey, one of the big,

00:07:57.634 --> 00:07:59.133
"big phrases that people use

00:07:59.133 --> 00:08:01.601
in addition to 'iPod car'
is iTrip."

00:08:01.601 --> 00:08:03.901
And this site doesn't use
that word once.

00:08:03.901 --> 00:08:05.133
Question. Yeah.

00:08:09.133 --> 00:08:12.234
Mm-hmm.

00:08:12.234 --> 00:08:13.567
Absolutely.

00:08:13.567 --> 00:08:14.934
So the question is,
"How do you get around

00:08:14.934 --> 00:08:16.667
"the fact that, you know,
maybe you don't--

00:08:16.667 --> 00:08:18.033
maybe you don't sell
the iTrip?"

00:08:18.033 --> 00:08:20.033
The fact is, people make,
you know,

00:08:20.033 --> 00:08:22.133
there are affiliate programs
for the iTrip.

00:08:22.133 --> 00:08:25.167
So what you can see right here
is iTrip is queried,

00:08:25.167 --> 00:08:28.834
like, 240,000 a month in April.

00:08:28.834 --> 00:08:31.501
And if you were
to do the query "iTrip,"

00:08:31.501 --> 00:08:35.167
um, there's Griffin,
there's all this stuff.

00:08:35.167 --> 00:08:38.467
I happen to know the guy
that's number one here, right?

00:08:38.467 --> 00:08:40.634
And it's one guy in New York.

00:08:40.634 --> 00:08:43.234
So it's not that iTrip is
some hugely competitive phrase

00:08:43.234 --> 00:08:44.734
that you could never
show up for.

00:08:44.734 --> 00:08:47.267
They could at least put a page
about the iTrip

00:08:47.267 --> 00:08:49.234
and start to show up
for some of those searches.

00:08:49.234 --> 00:08:50.567
Now, I don't want to get
too hung up.

00:08:50.567 --> 00:08:52.234
We've all--we've spent
almost ten minutes.

00:08:52.234 --> 00:08:55.434
So let's, uh, look at a couple
other sites.

00:08:55.434 --> 00:08:58.067
Um...

00:08:58.067 --> 00:09:01.767
is the owner
of fazalfurniture.com

00:09:01.767 --> 00:09:04.968
in the room?

00:09:04.968 --> 00:09:07.300
Good. Good.
I was hoping they wouldn't be,

00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:09.767
um, because I have to give
a little bit of tough love

00:09:09.767 --> 00:09:11.667
to fazalfurniture.

00:09:11.667 --> 00:09:15.834
So here's what the site
looks like.

00:09:15.834 --> 00:09:19.634
Uh, notice there's a lot
of bolding on this site.

00:09:19.634 --> 00:09:21.634
If you were a visitor
and you landed on this page,

00:09:21.634 --> 00:09:26.300
would you be comfortable
with this amount of bolding?

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:28.667
Uh, read a few of the words.

00:09:28.667 --> 00:09:32.100
It's almost like somebody's not
necessarily a native speaker.

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:34.100
This is the very first thing
a visitor's going to see.

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:36.868
They're--that's going to be
their impression of your site.

00:09:36.868 --> 00:09:38.400
So what's interesting
is this site

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:40.100
is only about six pages deep.

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:42.200
There's a front page
and then there's a details form

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:43.934
for each one of these phrases.

00:09:43.934 --> 00:09:46.367
And what's kind of interesting
is you click to get more details

00:09:46.367 --> 00:09:49.334
on this, say, Indonesian chair,
so you get a little picture,

00:09:49.334 --> 00:09:52.067
the picture
never gets bigger, right?

00:09:52.067 --> 00:09:54.567
"Oh, I want more details.
Yeah, show me a bigger picture."

00:09:54.567 --> 00:09:57.000
No, the picture never changes.
It stays the same size.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.501
So there's all kinds of ways

00:09:58.501 --> 00:10:01.234
that you could entice people
to order,

00:10:01.234 --> 00:10:03.501
and they're not necessarily
going to get enough information

00:10:03.501 --> 00:10:04.901
to feel comfortable.

00:10:04.901 --> 00:10:06.567
There's something else
you need to think about,

00:10:06.567 --> 00:10:08.701
which is the fit and finish
of your Website.

00:10:08.701 --> 00:10:10.767
And we'll go through
a couple examples of that.

00:10:10.767 --> 00:10:12.501
Does anybody see anything
that either gives them

00:10:12.501 --> 00:10:15.467
a huge amount of confidence
in buying from this site

00:10:15.467 --> 00:10:21.100
or maybe a little bit of pause
where they'd worry?

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:22.934
Yeah, the co--
yeah, the contact order,

00:10:22.934 --> 00:10:25.334
you know, is--it turns out
it's just a Web form.

00:10:25.334 --> 00:10:27.567
See this Rattan furniture?

00:10:27.567 --> 00:10:29.601
If you click to view details,

00:10:29.601 --> 00:10:34.000
uh, they keep spelling Rattan
a different way, right?

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.200
And if I were buying
for a motel,

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:38.033
I'd be, like, "Well,
don't you know how to spell

00:10:38.033 --> 00:10:40.400
the type of furniture
that you're selling?"

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:43.200
Either you do, in which case
you're deliberately misspelling,

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:45.434
which looks bad, or you don't.

00:10:45.434 --> 00:10:48.167
And if you don't know
how to spell the ingredients

00:10:48.167 --> 00:10:49.767
of your, uh, your furniture,

00:10:49.767 --> 00:10:52.334
that's a pretty bad sign
as well.

00:10:52.334 --> 00:10:54.767
So this is the sort of thing
where a--

00:10:54.767 --> 00:10:55.901
See, right here
they're calling it

00:10:55.901 --> 00:10:59.267
"rottan" furniture, right?

00:10:59.267 --> 00:11:01.701
And it may very well be
rotten furniture.

00:11:01.701 --> 00:11:05.667
We don't know.
But--yeah, go for it.

00:11:06.868 --> 00:11:09.167
Can we, uh, get
the other lap up if...

00:11:09.167 --> 00:11:10.901
White: Looks like your
background image it's using,

00:11:10.901 --> 00:11:14.434
the nice--really nice
word grain is, um, 1 megabyte.

00:11:14.434 --> 00:11:15.567
1,000 K.

00:11:15.567 --> 00:11:17.567
Cutts: Right.
White: It comes in...

00:11:17.567 --> 00:11:20.133
Cutts: No wonder my page load
is failing.

00:11:20.133 --> 00:11:23.701
A one--
yeah, a one-megabyte download--

00:11:23.701 --> 00:11:26.200
Okay, so we have pretty good
connectivity here.

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:27.801
My in-laws live in Omaha.

00:11:27.801 --> 00:11:30.601
So, like, every Christmas,
I have to go to Omaha.

00:11:30.601 --> 00:11:32.133
And I try to load
the Google home page.

00:11:32.133 --> 00:11:34.767
And for a long time,
they were on dial-up.

00:11:34.767 --> 00:11:37.000
How long do you think it took me
to load the Google home page,

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.634
which is the most spartan,
austere page, like, on the Web?

00:11:40.634 --> 00:11:43.133
Like 12 seconds on a modem.

00:11:43.133 --> 00:11:46.167
If you want to load
a one-megabyte background,

00:11:46.167 --> 00:11:48.133
you can pretty much start
at, you know--at the beginning

00:11:48.133 --> 00:11:49.501
of this session
and then come back

00:11:49.501 --> 00:11:50.901
at the end of this session.

00:11:50.901 --> 00:11:52.501
And then by the time
you're done, you're like,

00:11:52.501 --> 00:11:55.767
"Oh, this site sort of sucks
a little bit," right?

00:11:55.767 --> 00:11:58.100
So pay attention
to the fit and finish.

00:11:58.100 --> 00:11:59.767
Pay attention
to how it looks for the users,

00:11:59.767 --> 00:12:02.767
because if the users like it,
you'll get more conversions.

00:12:02.767 --> 00:12:04.634
And it can be all kinds
of little things.

00:12:04.634 --> 00:12:06.200
For example, "about us."

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:08.434
Oh, good, I can find out more
about this person.

00:12:08.434 --> 00:12:10.567
Click. Click. Click.

00:12:10.567 --> 00:12:13.868
Crap, It's not a link, right?

00:12:13.868 --> 00:12:15.534
So on one hand, this guy's done
a pretty good job.

00:12:15.534 --> 00:12:16.868
He's bought some sort
of template

00:12:16.868 --> 00:12:18.167
or something like that.

00:12:18.167 --> 00:12:20.534
So it's got a "contact us"
and "about us"

00:12:20.534 --> 00:12:22.167
and "home page."

00:12:22.167 --> 00:12:24.234
But he didn't have
an "about us" page

00:12:24.234 --> 00:12:27.234
so he just left
that text lying there.

00:12:27.234 --> 00:12:29.167
And that's not necessarily
very helpful.

00:12:29.167 --> 00:12:30.701
So pay attention
to the fit and finish.

00:12:30.701 --> 00:12:33.868
Pay attention to your images,
how fast things download.

00:12:33.868 --> 00:12:35.501
Please don't
call your furniture "rottan"

00:12:35.501 --> 00:12:37.100
if you're trying to spell it.

00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:39.400
And think about how the user's
going to perceive it.

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:41.434
There's a lot
of key words here, right?

00:12:41.434 --> 00:12:45.033
He--How many times does this guy
use the word "furniture"?

00:12:45.033 --> 00:12:47.033
A lot, right?

00:12:47.033 --> 00:12:48.367
It's not the case

00:12:48.367 --> 00:12:51.300
that if you repeat the word
"furniture" 100 times,

00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:53.334
you will do twice as well
in Google

00:12:53.334 --> 00:12:56.000
as if you say the word
"furniture" 50 times.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.234
I promise you.
We're pretty smart about that.

00:12:58.234 --> 00:12:59.767
After the first two
or three times,

00:12:59.767 --> 00:13:02.634
it ain't going to help
to say it 85 more times.

00:13:02.634 --> 00:13:05.367
So he doesn't need to say,
"Furniture, furniture,

00:13:05.367 --> 00:13:06.701
furniture, furniture,
furniture."

00:13:06.701 --> 00:13:08.167
If someone talked like this,

00:13:08.167 --> 00:13:11.400
they'd be the most annoying
person in the world, right?

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:14.000
So you may work with SEOs.
You may be an SEO.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.133
And you may get this question,

00:13:15.133 --> 00:13:17.734
"Well, what should
my keyword density be?"

00:13:17.734 --> 00:13:19.601
Don't worry
about your keyword density.

00:13:19.601 --> 00:13:21.467
If you have the word
on your page two, three times,

00:13:21.467 --> 00:13:23.601
Google knows about that word.

00:13:23.601 --> 00:13:25.200
Think about reading it
out loud.

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:26.701
If it sounds
like something normal

00:13:26.701 --> 00:13:28.400
if someone were reading it
out loud,

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:29.968
that's pretty good.

00:13:29.968 --> 00:13:31.601
It doesn't need to be
like you're a bot

00:13:31.601 --> 00:13:34.000
saying the word "furniture"
over and over and over again.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.434
And there's a few
interesting things here.

00:13:36.434 --> 00:13:38.701
He focuses
on the word "furniture,"

00:13:38.701 --> 00:13:41.501
but he could probably think
about other synonyms, right?

00:13:41.501 --> 00:13:42.868
Go to the Google keyword tool.

00:13:42.868 --> 00:13:44.634
There's lots of keyword tools
around the Web.

00:13:44.634 --> 00:13:46.133
What are some other words
for "furniture"

00:13:46.133 --> 00:13:48.400
that he could use
instead of "furniture"?

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:50.834
That's the sort of thing
that users might type in.

00:13:52.701 --> 00:13:54.868
Okay, so here's
a little interlude.

00:13:54.868 --> 00:13:58.968
Savetheinternet.com is dedicated
to net neutrality,

00:13:58.968 --> 00:14:00.701
Internet heroes and villains.

00:14:00.701 --> 00:14:03.067
It's, uh, hosted by Free Press.

00:14:03.067 --> 00:14:04.400
This is a cool site.

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:05.901
This is a site
which is about issues.

00:14:05.901 --> 00:14:08.467
This is a site about spreading
the word on net neutrality,

00:14:08.467 --> 00:14:12.400
which, personally, I think
is a pretty cool idea,

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:15.567
except...

00:14:15.567 --> 00:14:18.334
See this, uh--
see, I was on savetheinternet.

00:14:18.334 --> 00:14:20.968
I'm going to go check out
their blog.

00:14:20.968 --> 00:14:22.367
So I go and I try to access

00:14:22.367 --> 00:14:28.167
blog/wp-content/uploads/authors
/pleddle.html.

00:14:28.167 --> 00:14:30.300
What do you think--
assuming the Wi-Fi holds--

00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:32.701
what do you think
I'm going to land on

00:14:32.701 --> 00:14:35.901
if I'm looking
at this site's blog?

00:14:35.901 --> 00:14:39.400
Am I going to learn more
about net neutrality?

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:42.200
Am I going to learn
about freedom of the press?

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:43.367
If you look down here,

00:14:43.367 --> 00:14:46.567
now it's waiting
for healthshoponline.

00:14:46.567 --> 00:14:48.667
Why is a site
about net neutrality

00:14:48.667 --> 00:14:51.567
linking me
to healthshoponline?

00:14:51.567 --> 00:14:54.367
It turns out this site
has been hacked.

00:14:54.367 --> 00:14:59.634
And if you visit the blog,
you'll be offered VIAGRA, okay?

00:14:59.634 --> 00:15:01.334
So the point that I want
to get across--

00:15:01.334 --> 00:15:02.400
and here it comes.

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:03.601
Canadian Pharmacy.

00:15:03.601 --> 00:15:06.667
Number-one Internet online
drug store, right?

00:15:06.667 --> 00:15:08.167
You guys, as developers,

00:15:08.167 --> 00:15:11.934
are due for, like,
the most concentrated attack

00:15:11.934 --> 00:15:14.133
of hackers
that you would believe.

00:15:14.133 --> 00:15:16.234
It used to be people
would get individual PCs

00:15:16.234 --> 00:15:17.667
and hack their botnets.

00:15:17.667 --> 00:15:18.968
And as PCs get better,

00:15:18.968 --> 00:15:20.834
as more people roll out things
like Windows 7

00:15:20.834 --> 00:15:22.067
or switch to a Mac

00:15:22.067 --> 00:15:24.133
or use different browsers
that are more hardened,

00:15:24.133 --> 00:15:26.167
the clients are--
are getting pretty good.

00:15:26.167 --> 00:15:28.434
It's hard to hack
one of these bots--

00:15:28.434 --> 00:15:30.033
one of these PCs.

00:15:30.033 --> 00:15:32.868
So now people are going
to be attacking your Web server.

00:15:32.868 --> 00:15:36.000
So you have to keep
your server patched.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.334
This savetheinternet,
I've been to it before.

00:15:38.334 --> 00:15:40.601
I was like, "Oh, what are they
doing selling pills?"

00:15:40.601 --> 00:15:42.667
And it turns out, you know,
if you click on "blog,"

00:15:42.667 --> 00:15:45.367
it says something like, uh,
"We've been hacked.

00:15:45.367 --> 00:15:47.367
We're trying to figure out
what's going on."

00:15:47.367 --> 00:15:50.934
And yet the hack
is still live, right?

00:15:50.934 --> 00:15:53.067
So as soon as you find out
that you've been hacked,

00:15:53.067 --> 00:15:54.334
take it all down.

00:15:54.334 --> 00:15:56.234
Go ahead,
restore from backups.

00:15:56.234 --> 00:15:59.100
You have to apply your
server stuff really frequently.

00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:01.000
So stuff like WordPress,
for example,

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.300
comes out with relatively
frequent updates,

00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:04.901
and it's relatively easy.

00:16:04.901 --> 00:16:06.601
So now they've gotten
the blog back,

00:16:06.601 --> 00:16:09.934
but they don't realize that
they're still selling pills.

00:16:09.934 --> 00:16:11.534
So if you have a site,

00:16:11.534 --> 00:16:14.000
one thing that I would
absolutely recommend,

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.467
just run it as a daily search,

00:16:15.467 --> 00:16:19.734
or set it up in, you know, uh,
just a cron job or something.

00:16:19.734 --> 00:16:23.267
Do site:yourdomain.com
VIAGRA.

00:16:23.267 --> 00:16:26.734
Or site:yourdomain.com pills,
or online gambling,

00:16:26.734 --> 00:16:28.167
or XENICAL,
or Hydrocodone.

00:16:28.167 --> 00:16:30.133
You know, pick your favorite
debt consolidation,

00:16:30.133 --> 00:16:32.100
mortgages,
spammy kind of query,

00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:33.367
because if you're hacked,

00:16:33.367 --> 00:16:34.901
then you'll find out
about it really soon,

00:16:34.901 --> 00:16:36.667
and you'll be able to fix it
before it starts to effect

00:16:36.667 --> 00:16:38.534
your search rankings.

00:16:38.534 --> 00:16:41.400
Questions about that?
Make sense? Yeah.

00:16:46.033 --> 00:16:48.133
Yeah. Yep.

00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:57.968
Yep. Yeah.

00:16:57.968 --> 00:17:00.567
So the--the question is,
"If you use WordPress,

00:17:00.567 --> 00:17:02.834
you know, it's pretty easy
to get hacked."

00:17:02.834 --> 00:17:05.367
And the fact is, WordPress
has gotten much, much better.

00:17:05.367 --> 00:17:06.934
You know, they're including
one-time keys,

00:17:06.934 --> 00:17:09.100
all sorts of nonces,
things that protect you.

00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:11.234
So 2.7.1, 2.7.0

00:17:11.234 --> 00:17:13.033
are a lot less likely
to be hacked.

00:17:13.033 --> 00:17:14.400
But if you use
a stupid password--

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:17.100
like, suppose their admin
password was "savetheinternet,"

00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:18.200
people could still guess it.

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:19.334
People can still hack it.

00:17:19.334 --> 00:17:20.767
We're actually in the process--

00:17:20.767 --> 00:17:23.968
there's a--there's a site,
google.com/webmasters,

00:17:23.968 --> 00:17:25.934
and whenever we see your site
get hacked,

00:17:25.934 --> 00:17:27.601
we will often try
to send you a message

00:17:27.601 --> 00:17:30.701
and say, "Hey, we found the
following text on your page."

00:17:30.701 --> 00:17:33.400
Now, we can't detect that you're
hacked every single time.

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:35.000
But one thing that we've done
is we've scanned

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.701
for obsolete versions
of software.

00:17:36.701 --> 00:17:37.767
And we've said,

00:17:37.767 --> 00:17:39.234
"Okay, if you're running
WordPress 2.1.0,

00:17:39.234 --> 00:17:42.567
you're basically naked
on the Internet," right?

00:17:42.567 --> 00:17:45.334
If you're running a version
of WordPress, you know, 2.2.1,

00:17:45.334 --> 00:17:46.634
you're still naked
on the Internet.

00:17:46.634 --> 00:17:47.801
And it's not WordPress.

00:17:47.801 --> 00:17:49.067
It's Joomla!,
it's, uh, you know,

00:17:49.067 --> 00:17:50.701
all sorts of different--
Drupal--

00:17:50.701 --> 00:17:53.100
all these packages have had
holes at different times.

00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:54.501
So Google will try
to give you a warning,

00:17:54.501 --> 00:17:56.834
but we don't guarantee you
that we'll warn you.

00:17:56.834 --> 00:17:57.834
Yeah.

00:17:57.834 --> 00:18:00.834
[man speaking indistinctly]

00:18:06.067 --> 00:18:07.067
Yeah.

00:18:07.067 --> 00:18:08.934
[man speaking indistinctly]

00:18:08.934 --> 00:18:10.133
Yeah. Yeah.

00:18:10.133 --> 00:18:12.667
So we can take it offline
a little bit.

00:18:12.667 --> 00:18:13.834
But the basic idea is,

00:18:13.834 --> 00:18:15.334
if you notice
that you've been hacked,

00:18:15.334 --> 00:18:17.267
take your site down,
restore from backups,

00:18:17.267 --> 00:18:19.400
make sure that you're
as secure as possible.

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:21.534
And then you can do what's known
as a reconsideration request,

00:18:21.534 --> 00:18:23.067
at least for Google.

00:18:23.067 --> 00:18:25.167
And that says, "Hey, we're okay.
We've cleaned up the hack."

00:18:25.167 --> 00:18:27.067
We also have
a Google Webmaster forum.

00:18:27.067 --> 00:18:29.167
And that's linked to
from google.com/webmasters.

00:18:29.167 --> 00:18:31.234
So that's a couple ways
you can let Google know

00:18:31.234 --> 00:18:34.133
that things are, uh--
are fixed.

00:18:34.133 --> 00:18:35.801
So this one's
kind of an interesting site.

00:18:35.801 --> 00:18:41.334
This is HIV InSite at ucf--
ucsf.edu.

00:18:41.334 --> 00:18:42.601
Pretty cool site.

00:18:42.601 --> 00:18:45.300
Um, I noticed
a-a couple interesting things.

00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:48.400
Number one,
they're really not using

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:50.767
very much of this page.

00:18:50.767 --> 00:18:52.334
So if you want to see
what's going on,

00:18:52.334 --> 00:18:53.701
you have to go
all the way down here

00:18:53.701 --> 00:18:55.267
to see there's--there's basics.

00:18:55.267 --> 00:18:57.100
There's different sort
of things.

00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:58.400
The other thing--

00:18:58.400 --> 00:18:59.767
so I'll go ahead and use
the rest of this space

00:18:59.767 --> 00:19:01.100
by making the font bigger.

00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:04.167
Um, check out this one.

00:19:06.801 --> 00:19:08.901
Recommendations
for Use of Antiretroviral Drugs

00:19:08.901 --> 00:19:11.501
in Pregnant HIV-1-Infected Women
for Maternal Health

00:19:11.501 --> 00:19:14.434
and Interventions to Reduce
Perinatal HIV-1 Transmission

00:19:14.434 --> 00:19:15.801
in the United States.

00:19:15.801 --> 00:19:18.234
What is that about?

00:19:18.234 --> 00:19:20.968
I have no idea.

00:19:20.968 --> 00:19:23.000
I'm not an HIV expert.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.601
Is this the very first thing
that you want your users to see?

00:19:26.601 --> 00:19:28.000
Maybe it is.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.267
Maybe this public-health site
really wants to highlight

00:19:30.267 --> 00:19:33.334
what are the important
medical papers coming out.

00:19:33.334 --> 00:19:34.968
But if you're taking the time--

00:19:34.968 --> 00:19:37.234
And notice this says,
"Editors' Picks."

00:19:37.234 --> 00:19:41.701
So someone at UCSF has decided
that that's an important paper.

00:19:41.701 --> 00:19:42.968
If you're taking the time
to decide

00:19:42.968 --> 00:19:44.234
that's an important paper,

00:19:44.234 --> 00:19:47.734
include, like, a paragraph
of beginner language.

00:19:47.734 --> 00:19:48.901
What does this mean?

00:19:48.901 --> 00:19:51.968
"Oh, if you are a new mother,

00:19:51.968 --> 00:19:54.834
"it will help you
if you do the following steps.

00:19:54.834 --> 00:19:57.167
Click here to read more."
Right?

00:19:57.167 --> 00:19:59.501
So what's really interesting
is if you go down to the bottom,

00:19:59.501 --> 00:20:02.501
there's a section
called "Basics."

00:20:02.501 --> 00:20:04.334
And I'll just tell you,
you know,

00:20:04.334 --> 00:20:06.934
it's possible
that you can go to Google,

00:20:06.934 --> 00:20:09.834
and you can, uh--
if you go to Google

00:20:09.834 --> 00:20:11.767
and--and stand in the lobby,

00:20:11.767 --> 00:20:14.400
you can see queries
streaming by.

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:15.801
And if you ever do that,

00:20:15.801 --> 00:20:17.400
what you'll find
is that typically,

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:18.801
the sort of queries
that show up

00:20:18.801 --> 00:20:20.901
are not HIV transmission

00:20:20.901 --> 00:20:23.033
in maternal
blah blah blah blah blah.

00:20:23.033 --> 00:20:26.000
Here's what people type.
Make it really big.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.200
[hums]

00:20:33.767 --> 00:20:35.901
You'd be surprised
how many people type

00:20:35.901 --> 00:20:39.968
those queries, right?

00:20:39.968 --> 00:20:41.133
"Aah!

00:20:41.133 --> 00:20:42.267
"I went to the doctor.

00:20:42.267 --> 00:20:44.033
"The doctor used this really
long phrase.

00:20:44.033 --> 00:20:45.868
"And I don't know
if this is a serious disease

00:20:45.868 --> 00:20:47.467
or not, you know?"

00:20:47.467 --> 00:20:49.834
So people who come to Google
type in things like this.

00:20:49.834 --> 00:20:51.033
You'd be amazed.

00:20:51.033 --> 00:20:53.367
Something like 25%
of all the queries we get

00:20:53.367 --> 00:20:55.033
in a given month are unique.

00:20:55.033 --> 00:20:57.000
And it's because
it goes straight down deep

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.334
into the long tail.

00:20:58.334 --> 00:20:59.934
And they use beginner language.

00:20:59.934 --> 00:21:03.968
They are not using language
like, uh...

00:21:05.234 --> 00:21:07.234
You know,
here's the Basics section.

00:21:07.234 --> 00:21:10.934
"What are HIV and AIDS?"
"Should I get tested for HIV?"

00:21:10.934 --> 00:21:12.000
How about this question.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.400
"I just tested positive --
now what?"

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:15.133
"I just tested negative --
now what?"

00:21:15.133 --> 00:21:17.033
If you are designing this purely
for users,

00:21:17.033 --> 00:21:19.834
I would probably put this
section front and center, right?

00:21:19.834 --> 00:21:22.534
And move the research papers
a little bit further down,

00:21:22.534 --> 00:21:24.400
'cause if I'm a user,
I have to click a lot further

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:25.601
to find this.

00:21:25.601 --> 00:21:27.200
I just happened to see
the Basics section.

00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:29.100
This is the part that's going
to be of a lot more interest

00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:30.467
to your average user.

00:21:30.467 --> 00:21:33.100
So, you know, when people
come to Google

00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:35.267
and they start typing this,

00:21:35.267 --> 00:21:37.033
this is actually
a pretty good match

00:21:37.033 --> 00:21:38.367
for this sort of thing.

00:21:38.367 --> 00:21:40.000
So there's a ton
of good resources here,

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.033
but you might think
about rejuggling a little bit

00:21:42.033 --> 00:21:43.334
so it's
a little more crawlable,

00:21:43.334 --> 00:21:45.534
a little more,
um, understandable.

00:21:45.534 --> 00:21:48.601
So we call this, like,
the disconnect in jargon.

00:21:48.601 --> 00:21:52.434
Any of you guys
do industry sites with heavy--

00:21:52.434 --> 00:21:55.634
yeah, like,
technical language?

00:21:55.634 --> 00:21:58.901
Think about what the user
is going to type, right?

00:21:58.901 --> 00:22:01.634
That guy who was doing
iPod car integration,

00:22:01.634 --> 00:22:05.100
he's completely ignoring
the 250,000 people last month

00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:07.534
who said, "iTrip."

00:22:07.534 --> 00:22:10.400
He doesn't even have a mention
of that product on his page.

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:12.567
In the same way, this site,
while very good--

00:22:12.567 --> 00:22:15.434
in fact,
very crawlable, right?--

00:22:15.434 --> 00:22:17.868
sort of doesn't necessarily
match with the terms

00:22:17.868 --> 00:22:19.133
that users are going to use.

00:22:19.133 --> 00:22:20.834
And you want to think
about the first impression

00:22:20.834 --> 00:22:23.534
you have whenever you land
on a page.

00:22:23.534 --> 00:22:26.634
Does that make sense?
Cool.

00:22:26.634 --> 00:22:29.167
All right.
Let's look at another site.

00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:35.133
Ah.
What do you think?

00:22:39.234 --> 00:22:41.334
This is what my team sees
all day, every day,

00:22:41.334 --> 00:22:42.667
all day long.

00:22:42.667 --> 00:22:45.634
Uh, blogsense.biz.

00:22:45.634 --> 00:22:48.567
Uh, post number 1,276.

00:22:48.567 --> 00:22:50.968
So he's done 1,275
previous blog posts

00:22:50.968 --> 00:22:53.067
just like this.

00:22:53.067 --> 00:22:55.234
"Radmaxx kicker fx,
phantom electric scooter,

00:22:55.234 --> 00:22:58.601
used electric scooter,
schwin, new."

00:22:58.601 --> 00:23:01.734
So don't do
this kind of stuff, right?

00:23:01.734 --> 00:23:04.033
If you ever get somebody
coming to you and saying,

00:23:04.033 --> 00:23:07.200
"Hey, uh, we've got an idea
to generate

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:12.901
"a lot of envelope pages,
hallway pages, doorway pages,

00:23:12.901 --> 00:23:14.834
shadow domains,
whatever you want to call them."

00:23:14.834 --> 00:23:16.100
A lot of things that--

00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:18.434
"Oh, it's okay.
there's no spam on your domain.

00:23:18.434 --> 00:23:20.167
"We put the spam
on other places,

00:23:20.167 --> 00:23:22.801
and then we sort of funnel them
in your direction."

00:23:22.801 --> 00:23:25.133
Users hate this kind of stuff.

00:23:25.133 --> 00:23:26.601
Check out the previous post.

00:23:26.601 --> 00:23:30.400
"Aamaryland Child Support
Check myIowa," right?

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:32.834
It's pretty much
complete gibberish.

00:23:32.834 --> 00:23:35.334
And I hope that programmers
in the audience

00:23:35.334 --> 00:23:38.734
are not thinking, "How could I
generate a page like this?"

00:23:38.734 --> 00:23:39.868
I'll tell you right now,

00:23:39.868 --> 00:23:41.501
they use things
like Hidden Markov Models.

00:23:41.501 --> 00:23:43.067
They scrape search results.

00:23:43.067 --> 00:23:44.534
They try to find out
search results--

00:23:44.534 --> 00:23:46.534
search queries
that people have done.

00:23:46.534 --> 00:23:49.033
But the nice thing is this stuff
is pretty detectable.

00:23:49.033 --> 00:23:52.334
Uh, it's relatively rare
to see pages like this

00:23:52.334 --> 00:23:53.667
on the Web these days.

00:23:53.667 --> 00:23:55.601
Or they exist on the Web,
but you're less likely

00:23:55.601 --> 00:23:57.634
to find them
through search engines.

00:23:57.634 --> 00:24:00.334
Notice that even the spammer's
getting spammed.

00:24:00.334 --> 00:24:01.968
He's got a WordPress template,
and it says,

00:24:01.968 --> 00:24:04.434
"Download movies,
mortgage calculator gadgets,"

00:24:04.434 --> 00:24:06.434
and he's got little links
down at the bottom.

00:24:06.434 --> 00:24:09.901
So a lot of this stuff
is just completely awful links.

00:24:09.901 --> 00:24:11.534
The reason why I wanted
to show you this one

00:24:11.534 --> 00:24:14.467
is a lot of the times,
people come to me--

00:24:14.467 --> 00:24:17.100
And I'm guessing almost everyone
in this audience

00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:20.300
is going to be, "Okay,
should I break my articles

00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:21.767
"into multiple pages?

00:24:21.767 --> 00:24:23.601
"You know, what if I have
a one-page thing

00:24:23.601 --> 00:24:25.400
"where I can print
the entire article?

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:27.300
Is that going to be
duplicate content?"

00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:29.133
It's amazing to me
how many white hat people come,

00:24:29.133 --> 00:24:30.501
and they're worried
about something

00:24:30.501 --> 00:24:32.234
that's, like, you know--

00:24:32.234 --> 00:24:33.601
I can understand
why they're worried,

00:24:33.601 --> 00:24:35.501
but they really don't need
to worry nearly as much

00:24:35.501 --> 00:24:37.267
as these guys.

00:24:37.267 --> 00:24:39.367
The black hat guys
don't skirt the line.

00:24:39.367 --> 00:24:41.601
They go--boosh--
right through that barrier

00:24:41.601 --> 00:24:43.868
and break through it
and go as fast as they can

00:24:43.868 --> 00:24:46.667
toward the keyword stuff
and sort of spam stuff.

00:24:46.667 --> 00:24:49.634
So, uh, it's natural
that people worry

00:24:49.634 --> 00:24:50.701
about different things.

00:24:50.701 --> 00:24:51.801
But most of the times,

00:24:51.801 --> 00:24:54.267
you don't need
to stress that much.

00:24:54.267 --> 00:24:56.701
Okay, let's look
at another one--

00:24:56.701 --> 00:24:59.501
Comfortfeetshop.com.

00:25:01.234 --> 00:25:02.734
What do you like,
and what do you dislike?

00:25:02.734 --> 00:25:04.234
Get a little
audience participation.

00:25:04.234 --> 00:25:07.534
What do you think is good
about this page?

00:25:07.534 --> 00:25:08.601
There's some pictures.

00:25:08.601 --> 00:25:11.000
Someone else was saying
something else?

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.234
Brands--
actual brand names, yes.

00:25:13.234 --> 00:25:15.434
Mephisto.
I've heard of that.

00:25:15.434 --> 00:25:16.968
ECCO.
I've heard of that.

00:25:16.968 --> 00:25:19.167
Okay, what do you dislike?

00:25:21.634 --> 00:25:24.734
Brands. There's--there's a lot
of brands here.

00:25:24.734 --> 00:25:27.400
Now, and you said--

00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:30.567
Yes, yeah, this--
things need to be centered.

00:25:30.567 --> 00:25:31.901
You know, it's kind of weird

00:25:31.901 --> 00:25:33.567
that it's left-justified here.
and centered here.

00:25:33.567 --> 00:25:36.000
That's a little strange.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.167
The text is really weird.
Look at this.

00:25:38.167 --> 00:25:40.801
Oh, yeah, I would like to buy
some Cole Haan.

00:25:40.801 --> 00:25:44.067
I can't buy it.
It won't let me buy it.

00:25:44.067 --> 00:25:47.067
Please, give me
some Cole Haan, right?

00:25:47.067 --> 00:25:49.834
So number one,
that text looks a little--

00:25:49.834 --> 00:25:52.534
sub-optimal is a polite way
to say it.

00:25:52.534 --> 00:25:54.100
And number two,
it's not even clickable.

00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:55.534
So if you do want to get
some Cole Haan,

00:25:55.534 --> 00:25:57.534
you can't click on it
and get to it.

00:25:57.534 --> 00:26:00.501
It turns out the secret is...

00:26:00.501 --> 00:26:05.133
that the individual images
are clickable.

00:26:05.133 --> 00:26:06.834
So there's a really good
principle of Web design,

00:26:06.834 --> 00:26:09.100
which is,
"Keep it simple, stupid," right?

00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:12.567
And that is users are just
going to click on random things

00:26:12.567 --> 00:26:14.067
all over the place, everywhere.

00:26:14.067 --> 00:26:17.167
And so imagine--imagine
if you have an RSS icon,

00:26:17.167 --> 00:26:20.067
and you have RSS feed
as anchor text.

00:26:20.067 --> 00:26:22.167
Make both
of those clickable, right?

00:26:22.167 --> 00:26:24.133
In the same way you want
to make the image clickable

00:26:24.133 --> 00:26:25.634
and the text clickable.

00:26:25.634 --> 00:26:27.767
Don't put it, you know,
a lot of the times,

00:26:27.767 --> 00:26:29.534
you can learn something
by saying, "You know what?

00:26:29.534 --> 00:26:31.133
Let's get a regular user."

00:26:31.133 --> 00:26:33.234
I swear, probably the best $20
you can spend

00:26:33.234 --> 00:26:35.601
is grab a regular person
off the street,

00:26:35.601 --> 00:26:37.133
put them in front
of your Web page,

00:26:37.133 --> 00:26:38.267
sit on your hands--

00:26:38.267 --> 00:26:40.234
you're not allowed
to say anything--

00:26:40.234 --> 00:26:42.534
and watch them
try to buy, right?

00:26:42.534 --> 00:26:44.100
And so if they tried
to click on this--

00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:45.767
Of course, the Wi-Fi's gone.

00:26:45.767 --> 00:26:49.200
If, uh--if they try
to click on a--on text

00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:51.934
and they can't get to the brands
that they want to buy,

00:26:51.934 --> 00:26:54.934
they get really irritated
by that.

00:26:54.934 --> 00:26:56.534
While we're waiting
for this page to load,

00:26:56.534 --> 00:26:58.834
what do you notice
about the URL?

00:27:01.334 --> 00:27:02.434
It is meaningless.

00:27:02.434 --> 00:27:03.901
There's no way a user

00:27:03.901 --> 00:27:06.367
can remember
this particular URL.

00:27:06.367 --> 00:27:10.267
In fact, did you notice it has
an exclamation point in it?

00:27:10.267 --> 00:27:12.267
You don't see URLs
with exclamation points in them

00:27:12.267 --> 00:27:13.734
very often.

00:27:13.734 --> 00:27:16.467
And, in fact,
if you looked at the home page,

00:27:16.467 --> 00:27:19.133
the, uh--see if I can hit
the back button

00:27:19.133 --> 00:27:23.501
without hitting reload--
the URL was this, right?

00:27:23.501 --> 00:27:25.801
So there's clearly
a content-management system--

00:27:25.801 --> 00:27:28.734
a CMS--that is loading
the home page,

00:27:28.734 --> 00:27:31.934
which is homepage.template.

00:27:31.934 --> 00:27:33.067
I like to call this,

00:27:33.067 --> 00:27:35.300
"When you're fighting
with your CMS."

00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:37.701
You shouldn't have to fight
with your CMS.

00:27:37.701 --> 00:27:40.267
Whenever you have, "Oh, yeah,
go to the product URL,

00:27:40.267 --> 00:27:45.400
it's just gez!mep
yada yada yada,"

00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:47.200
users are not going
to remember that as much.

00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:49.801
Search engines are barely
going to be able to crawl that.

00:27:49.801 --> 00:27:55.267
So if you can go
to comfortfeetshop.com,

00:27:55.267 --> 00:27:56.667
see, even then,
it still redirects me

00:27:56.667 --> 00:27:58.734
to the deep URL.

00:27:58.734 --> 00:28:00.567
And so if you can,
it's much better

00:28:00.567 --> 00:28:01.968
if you can stick
with short URLs,

00:28:01.968 --> 00:28:03.467
if they can be very memorable,

00:28:03.467 --> 00:28:05.501
if you don't have to fight
with your CMS.

00:28:05.501 --> 00:28:07.667
And the thing is, it's 2009.

00:28:07.667 --> 00:28:09.701
We shouldn't be fighting
with CMSes at this point.

00:28:09.701 --> 00:28:11.033
If there's a CMS
that isn't built

00:28:11.033 --> 00:28:12.467
to be search engine friendly,

00:28:12.467 --> 00:28:16.534
consider going
to a different CMS, right?

00:28:16.534 --> 00:28:18.234
Be that voice that says,
"You know what?

00:28:18.234 --> 00:28:19.901
"If the CMS hasn't even thought

00:28:19.901 --> 00:28:21.901
"about what search engines
might do,

00:28:21.901 --> 00:28:23.067
"maybe you need to switch

00:28:23.067 --> 00:28:24.701
to something
a little bit different."

00:28:24.701 --> 00:28:26.934
Does that make sense?

00:28:26.934 --> 00:28:29.267
Yeah, question.

00:28:43.467 --> 00:28:45.601
All right, so we'll do this--
we'll do one go around,

00:28:45.601 --> 00:28:47.300
which is
this power-user question,

00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:49.300
which is, suppose
I've got two links on a page.

00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:51.434
They both go
to the same place.

00:28:51.434 --> 00:28:54.234
Should I put a rel="nofollow"
on one of those links?

00:28:54.234 --> 00:28:57.067
So first let's back up and talk
about what nofollow is.

00:28:57.067 --> 00:28:59.334
Nofollow is a simple attribute
that you can put on links

00:28:59.334 --> 00:29:00.467
that says, "you know what?

00:29:00.467 --> 00:29:02.200
Don't necessarily float
page rank.

00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:05.467
Don't necessarily float
anchor text across this link."

00:29:05.467 --> 00:29:06.801
And my short answer is no.

00:29:06.801 --> 00:29:08.467
In general,
whenever you're linking around

00:29:08.467 --> 00:29:10.868
within your site,
don't use nofollow.

00:29:10.868 --> 00:29:12.767
Just go ahead and link
to whatever stuff.

00:29:12.767 --> 00:29:15.701
And the site architecture
that you decide to use

00:29:15.701 --> 00:29:18.234
decides where the page rank
flows within your site.

00:29:18.234 --> 00:29:20.300
That's why if you have
a treelike structure

00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:22.434
and you have
the most important stuff first,

00:29:22.434 --> 00:29:23.868
it'll get the most page rank,

00:29:23.868 --> 00:29:26.901
because most people link
to the root of your page.

00:29:26.901 --> 00:29:29.434
So you remember
the HIV InSite one, right?

00:29:29.434 --> 00:29:31.868
They had
the medical articles up front,

00:29:31.868 --> 00:29:33.734
and then the basics
were down here,

00:29:33.734 --> 00:29:35.801
buried two or three
mouse clicks deep.

00:29:35.801 --> 00:29:38.167
That's a good argument
to swap those two.

00:29:38.167 --> 00:29:40.100
You'll get more page rank
for the Basics

00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:42.400
and the deep medical articles
that less people are interested

00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:43.501
are further down.

00:29:43.501 --> 00:29:44.801
So a good way
to think about it--

00:29:44.801 --> 00:29:47.067
and it works for search engines
as well as for users--

00:29:47.067 --> 00:29:50.501
is how many
mouse clicks away am I?

00:29:50.501 --> 00:29:52.100
How many mouse clicks
does it take

00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:54.400
to buy your
iPod car integration?

00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:55.834
How many mouse clicks
does it take

00:29:55.834 --> 00:29:58.100
to buy your women's sandals?

00:29:58.100 --> 00:30:01.868
So that is almost
kind of a good proxy

00:30:01.868 --> 00:30:03.367
of page rank,

00:30:03.367 --> 00:30:05.701
because page rank
is like a random surfer.

00:30:05.701 --> 00:30:06.868
Whenever we find a page,

00:30:06.868 --> 00:30:09.634
we extract
all the outgoing links.

00:30:09.634 --> 00:30:10.801
We take the out degree.

00:30:10.801 --> 00:30:13.000
We divide your page rank
by the out degree.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:14.434
And page rank
more or less flows

00:30:14.434 --> 00:30:17.167
in that proportion
to all those pages.

00:30:17.167 --> 00:30:19.501
So the closer you are
to the root page

00:30:19.501 --> 00:30:20.801
in terms of links,

00:30:20.801 --> 00:30:23.367
the more page rank
your page will have.

00:30:23.367 --> 00:30:27.033
So if you have to clink
17 links to find, you know,

00:30:27.033 --> 00:30:28.534
a particular page,

00:30:28.534 --> 00:30:31.133
that means Googlebot
has to click 17 links

00:30:31.133 --> 00:30:32.767
to get to that particular page.

00:30:32.767 --> 00:30:35.000
So the amount of page rank
will be much, much less.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:36.133
That's why you should think

00:30:36.133 --> 00:30:38.567
about putting
your most important stuff

00:30:38.567 --> 00:30:40.100
relatively close to the root.

00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:41.734
Now, I'm talking
in a virtual sense.

00:30:41.734 --> 00:30:42.868
Imagine if you click one link,

00:30:42.868 --> 00:30:45.734
and it gets you three
directories deep.

00:30:45.734 --> 00:30:47.934
Is that a problem?

00:30:47.934 --> 00:30:49.100
On Google, it's not.

00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:50.868
We only look at,
"Oh, there was one link,

00:30:50.868 --> 00:30:52.734
"and it went, you know,
three directories deep

00:30:52.734 --> 00:30:54.033
within the site."

00:30:54.033 --> 00:30:56.000
That's totally fine.
It's just one link.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:57.801
There are some search engines
who probably look

00:30:57.801 --> 00:31:01.067
at the number of depth
of the directory.

00:31:01.067 --> 00:31:03.200
So if you can make it
relatively close to the root

00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:05.667
on the number--
the number of subdirectories,

00:31:05.667 --> 00:31:07.000
that's not
a bad practice either.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:08.601
Then you might do
a little bit better on Yahoo!

00:31:08.601 --> 00:31:10.400
You might do a little bit better
on Microsoft.

00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:12.868
But on Google, you don't need
to worry about that.

00:31:12.868 --> 00:31:14.734
So the question, pulling back,

00:31:14.734 --> 00:31:16.767
is, should I put nofollow
on one of these links?

00:31:16.767 --> 00:31:18.934
No.
Let all the page rank flow.

00:31:18.934 --> 00:31:21.033
The only rank time
I'd really use nofollow

00:31:21.033 --> 00:31:22.601
on your own internal links

00:31:22.601 --> 00:31:24.767
where you say,
"No, don't flow any page rank,"

00:31:24.767 --> 00:31:26.801
is maybe a login page, right?

00:31:26.801 --> 00:31:28.067
Think about Expedia.

00:31:28.067 --> 00:31:30.400
If I go to Expedia
and there's a login page,

00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:34.000
what good is it if Googlebot
crawls that login page?

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:35.667
We don't have a credit card.

00:31:35.667 --> 00:31:38.067
Googlebot's not going to fly
to Vegas for the weekend.

00:31:38.067 --> 00:31:39.901
So you don't need us
to, you know, go and visit

00:31:39.901 --> 00:31:41.167
your login page.

00:31:41.167 --> 00:31:42.767
So that would be a good one
to put nofollow on.

00:31:42.767 --> 00:31:44.267
Don't--Don't bother to waste
the page rank

00:31:44.267 --> 00:31:48.033
on, you know, uh, that sort
of stuff happening.

00:31:48.033 --> 00:31:51.234
Mm-hmm.
Tell you what...

00:31:51.234 --> 00:31:53.701
maybe--maybe take it offline
and catch it after.

00:31:53.701 --> 00:31:58.434
Okay, now we reach the very
active participation part.

00:31:58.434 --> 00:32:01.801
I want everybody
to close your eyes.

00:32:01.801 --> 00:32:04.267
I still see open eyes.
No, seriously, close your eyes.

00:32:04.267 --> 00:32:05.801
Close your eyes.

00:32:05.801 --> 00:32:07.801
While I have your eyes closed,
I'm going to bring up a site.

00:32:07.801 --> 00:32:09.667
Keep your eyes closed.

00:32:09.667 --> 00:32:12.868
Okay, open your eyes.
Snap judgment.

00:32:12.868 --> 00:32:15.901
What's this site about?

00:32:15.901 --> 00:32:18.367
What does this site do?

00:32:18.367 --> 00:32:20.200
No idea.
Closebys.

00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:21.801
"Closeby services
meet Close friends

00:32:21.801 --> 00:32:23.534
to share the small things."

00:32:23.534 --> 00:32:25.601
What the heck does that mean?

00:32:25.601 --> 00:32:28.400
I have no idea.
Okay, well, let's dig deeper.

00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:32.267
"3 cents to 10 cents/ACElet
upto $110/year."

00:32:32.267 --> 00:32:35.767
What does that mean?
I have no idea.

00:32:35.767 --> 00:32:38.968
Okay. Um, "Everyone qualifies
for 3 cents."

00:32:38.968 --> 00:32:41.400
Yes! I've made 3 cents.
What does that mean?

00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:43.334
I have no idea.

00:32:43.334 --> 00:32:44.667
Okay, so let's start
digging deeper.

00:32:44.667 --> 00:32:46.601
Let's start clicking around
within the site.

00:32:46.601 --> 00:32:51.734
"Hair Salons. Auto.
Maintenance. Home."

00:32:51.734 --> 00:32:53.567
Now, if you're looking
in the bottom left,

00:32:53.567 --> 00:32:56.567
every single one of them
leads to the same URL.

00:32:56.567 --> 00:32:59.701
They all lead
to closebys.com/services.

00:32:59.701 --> 00:33:02.067
Okay, so I'm getting
confused here.

00:33:02.067 --> 00:33:05.067
"Maintenance.
Health &amp; Fitness. Travel."

00:33:05.067 --> 00:33:08.033
Okay, let's click on Travel.

00:33:08.033 --> 00:33:10.133
If someone can't land
on your site

00:33:10.133 --> 00:33:13.467
and know what it's about
in a second or two,

00:33:13.467 --> 00:33:15.701
you've lost probably half
your buyers

00:33:15.701 --> 00:33:17.968
or half of your conversions

00:33:17.968 --> 00:33:21.334
or half of whatever it is you're
trying to optimize, right?

00:33:21.334 --> 00:33:23.667
So this is a good example
where you get that person,

00:33:23.667 --> 00:33:25.667
and you say,
"Okay, I will give you $20

00:33:25.667 --> 00:33:26.701
to use my site."

00:33:26.701 --> 00:33:28.367
And probably
the first five people

00:33:28.367 --> 00:33:32.501
to use that site are like,
"What--What is it?", right?

00:33:32.501 --> 00:33:37.267
Oh, we sell ACElets.
What are ACElets?

00:33:37.267 --> 00:33:39.501
ACE is an announcement,
coupon, or event

00:33:39.501 --> 00:33:41.534
sent to you
by your local business.

00:33:41.534 --> 00:33:43.400
Okay, so now we start
to get to it.

00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:45.133
You register for ACElets,

00:33:45.133 --> 00:33:46.901
and then you can get these sort
of offers sent to you,

00:33:46.901 --> 00:33:48.567
and they can be coupons.

00:33:48.567 --> 00:33:50.634
So that can be pretty useful.

00:33:50.634 --> 00:33:52.901
Um...

00:33:52.901 --> 00:33:55.601
start to look
into it a little bit more.

00:33:55.601 --> 00:33:57.934
Services pay per customer.

00:33:57.934 --> 00:34:00.801
It's a little bit
opaque, right?

00:34:00.801 --> 00:34:02.901
What does Closebysocial

00:34:02.901 --> 00:34:06.400
have to do with businesses
allocated, right?

00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:08.400
And so this is another one
where you want to sort of think

00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:11.167
about the fit and finish
of your site.

00:34:11.167 --> 00:34:14.701
I-I--We were doing
a practice session at Google.

00:34:14.701 --> 00:34:16.667
And I was saying,
"Okay, close your eyes.

00:34:16.667 --> 00:34:18.634
Open your eyes.
And what does this site do?"

00:34:18.634 --> 00:34:20.868
And somebody was, like,
"They sell guns!"

00:34:20.868 --> 00:34:23.267
"What?
Why do they sell guns?"

00:34:23.267 --> 00:34:25.467
"'Cause there's an NRA show."

00:34:25.467 --> 00:34:28.300
"NRA. Maybe the--
Oh, that's the restaurant.

00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:29.467
Okay."

00:34:29.467 --> 00:34:30.601
They seriously thought,

00:34:30.601 --> 00:34:32.267
and I seriously thought
until I moused over it,

00:34:32.267 --> 00:34:34.834
that this was
about selling guns, right?

00:34:34.834 --> 00:34:38.133
So think about the overall fit
and finish.

00:34:38.133 --> 00:34:40.634
Um, and here's
a simple example.

00:34:40.634 --> 00:34:45.434
"Upto" is two words, right?

00:34:45.434 --> 00:34:47.267
That's like the fifth word
that you see

00:34:47.267 --> 00:34:49.000
whenever you start
reading the page.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:50.567
So think
about the little things.

00:34:50.567 --> 00:34:51.968
Think about
the fit and finish.

00:34:51.968 --> 00:34:54.367
Think about--There's actually
a pixel missing here,

00:34:54.367 --> 00:34:56.434
which you might
or might not be able to see.

00:34:56.434 --> 00:34:59.467
And so how--how professional
do these things look?

00:34:59.467 --> 00:35:01.534
Um, as you click around,

00:35:01.534 --> 00:35:03.667
it's actually
kind of an interesting idea.

00:35:03.667 --> 00:35:05.000
If someone wants to save money,

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.601
they can sign up
and get these announcements,

00:35:07.601 --> 00:35:09.968
coupons, and events,
stuff like that.

00:35:09.968 --> 00:35:11.634
So it can be pretty handy.

00:35:11.634 --> 00:35:13.400
But you're not doing
a very good job

00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:15.534
of communicating it to people.

00:35:15.534 --> 00:35:17.067
Now, I've--I've been
a little sarcastic.

00:35:17.067 --> 00:35:18.067
I've been a little mean.

00:35:18.067 --> 00:35:19.667
So what's good about this site?

00:35:19.667 --> 00:35:22.734
Anybody want to chime in?
What do they think?

00:35:24.334 --> 00:35:26.434
You won't--You won't fall asleep
looking at it.

00:35:26.434 --> 00:35:27.534
That's true.

00:35:27.534 --> 00:35:29.200
It looks a little
like a MySpace page.

00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:30.601
Got the glitter.

00:35:30.601 --> 00:35:33.133
You know, that would sort of
complete the look a little bit.

00:35:33.133 --> 00:35:36.501
Um, I think this
is kind of interesting too.

00:35:36.501 --> 00:35:41.000
This is a banner ad on Closebys
for Closeby services.

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:44.868
And if you click on it,
you go back to Closebys, right?

00:35:44.868 --> 00:35:46.033
Fit and finish.

00:35:46.033 --> 00:35:47.634
It's not all
about search engines.

00:35:47.634 --> 00:35:50.400
It's also about your users.
It's also about your visitors.

00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:53.701
Now, it's not completely
the same URL.

00:35:53.701 --> 00:35:55.033
In fact, if you look at it,

00:35:55.033 --> 00:35:58.634
it's actually
closebys/index.html.

00:35:58.634 --> 00:36:00.868
And that brings me to a topic
that I wanted to mention.

00:36:00.868 --> 00:36:03.667
You would be amazed
how many people

00:36:03.667 --> 00:36:08.701
have got
closebys.com/index.html,

00:36:08.701 --> 00:36:13.400
index.php, noindex.html,
www.closebys,

00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:16.033
non-www closebys.

00:36:16.033 --> 00:36:18.634
So one of the big pieces
of advice that I give

00:36:18.634 --> 00:36:22.534
is look at the internal linking
on your site and be consistent.

00:36:22.534 --> 00:36:25.100
You would be amazed--
literally amazed--

00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:28.934
at how many sites have a www
and a non-www version

00:36:28.934 --> 00:36:30.200
of their Website.

00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:31.968
Now, why would that matter
to you?

00:36:31.968 --> 00:36:34.033
Greg, Brian, why would it be
a bad thing

00:36:34.033 --> 00:36:37.200
if I had two different versions
of my Web page?

00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:38.601
Grothaus: Well, one--
for one reason,

00:36:38.601 --> 00:36:40.934
if people are going
to your Website,

00:36:40.934 --> 00:36:42.567
uh, they'll go to one page
or the other.

00:36:42.567 --> 00:36:44.133
And as a result,
they'll--they're sharing

00:36:44.133 --> 00:36:45.400
that Website
with their friends.

00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:46.667
They'll send you one
or the other.

00:36:46.667 --> 00:36:47.834
And all of your links
on the Web

00:36:47.834 --> 00:36:49.133
will end up being split

00:36:49.133 --> 00:36:51.234
between those two different
versions of the site.

00:36:51.234 --> 00:36:52.767
Uh, Google's pretty good
at noticing this.

00:36:52.767 --> 00:36:55.000
But sometimes when we see
that maybe these two pages

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.300
look different,
maybe we'll crawl one version

00:36:57.300 --> 00:36:58.934
and crawl another version
at a different time.

00:36:58.934 --> 00:37:00.834
And you have changed your site
dramatically in between them.

00:37:00.834 --> 00:37:02.901
And so we're a little--We can
get a little bit confused.

00:37:02.901 --> 00:37:04.734
Are these the same page,
or are they not?

00:37:04.734 --> 00:37:06.234
And maybe we'll split
your link juice

00:37:06.234 --> 00:37:07.734
between the two pages
and not give you full credit

00:37:07.734 --> 00:37:09.701
for all your links
to one single site,

00:37:09.701 --> 00:37:11.100
which is what
you really want.

00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:13.367
Cutts: Absolutely.
We normally do a good job.

00:37:13.367 --> 00:37:15.467
We normally can say
these are the same.

00:37:15.467 --> 00:37:17.834
But imagine if this
is a dynamic page, right?

00:37:17.834 --> 00:37:19.501
What if right up
at the top of the page,

00:37:19.501 --> 00:37:22.501
you say "the current date is"
with a time stamp?

00:37:22.501 --> 00:37:24.534
And then we visit
www and non-www,

00:37:24.534 --> 00:37:26.133
and the pages look
a little different.

00:37:26.133 --> 00:37:29.601
We might not correctly
glom those together.

00:37:29.601 --> 00:37:32.868
So I've actually seen
a www have a page rank 6

00:37:32.868 --> 00:37:35.467
and a non-www of the page
have a page rank 4.

00:37:35.467 --> 00:37:36.934
So they're splitting
their page rank

00:37:36.934 --> 00:37:38.400
in between those pages.

00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:39.901
Whenever you can,
it's really nice

00:37:39.901 --> 00:37:42.000
if you can kind of unify them
and bring them together

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:43.501
a little bit.

00:37:43.501 --> 00:37:44.901
Questions about that?

00:37:44.901 --> 00:37:47.734
Yeah.

00:37:47.734 --> 00:37:49.000
Oh, speak up.
Shout it out.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.434
White: Can you go
to the mic, perhaps?

00:37:50.434 --> 00:37:52.367
Cutts: In fact, come to the--
come to the microphone.

00:37:52.367 --> 00:37:54.400
Guy's like, "I didn't want
to be embarrassed like this.

00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:56.300
Come on."

00:37:56.300 --> 00:37:57.567
man:
Um, does it help to have,

00:37:57.567 --> 00:37:59.901
like, a redirecting,
uh, application

00:37:59.901 --> 00:38:02.000
or something like that
for those type of domains?

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:03.968
Like, doing 301 redirects
or something?

00:38:03.968 --> 00:38:05.300
Cutts:
Yeah, absolutely.

00:38:05.300 --> 00:38:08.801
Um, it helps to have 301s
internally and externally.

00:38:08.801 --> 00:38:11.968
So Google
is a very large Website.

00:38:11.968 --> 00:38:13.934
A lot of people come to Google.

00:38:13.934 --> 00:38:16.000
And so a lot of people
register domains

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:18.868
that sound like Google
or variants of Google.

00:38:18.868 --> 00:38:21.901
For example, porngoogle,

00:38:21.901 --> 00:38:24.100
googlesex,

00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:25.934
googlingfordollars, right?

00:38:25.934 --> 00:38:28.467
All these people, they are like,
"Oh, I'm going to make money

00:38:28.467 --> 00:38:29.801
off the Google
domain name," right?

00:38:29.801 --> 00:38:31.567
And so they register
something something Google.

00:38:31.567 --> 00:38:32.634
And then we have to go
and say,

00:38:32.634 --> 00:38:34.200
"Hey, you didn't invent
the word Google.

00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:36.868
"Can we have googleporn
or googlesex or whatever back?"

00:38:36.868 --> 00:38:38.667
And they're like, "Okay, fine.
Here you go."

00:38:38.667 --> 00:38:40.634
Now we have this domain,
googlesex.com.

00:38:40.634 --> 00:38:42.100
What are we going to do
with that?

00:38:42.100 --> 00:38:45.100
We're not going to have
an unsafe version of Google

00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:47.601
that's, like, only porn, right?

00:38:47.601 --> 00:38:49.000
Matt's house of porn.

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:51.133
Do all your searches here
and get all the sort of weird,

00:38:51.133 --> 00:38:52.133
fetish stuff you want.

00:38:52.133 --> 00:38:54.200
We're not going to do that.

00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:57.334
So what we do instead
is we do a 301 redirect.

00:38:57.334 --> 00:38:59.100
And that's
a permanent redirect.

00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:02.067
And 301 just refers
to the HTTP status code.

00:39:02.067 --> 00:39:04.400
You can pretend to be a browser
using Telnet.

00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:07.400
So if you Telnet to port 80
and say, "Get slash,"

00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:08.968
that's saying,
"Give me the root of this page

00:39:08.968 --> 00:39:10.534
on your Web server."

00:39:10.534 --> 00:39:13.400
And the--the response code
is 200, okay,

00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:14.868
if it's a normal page.

00:39:14.868 --> 00:39:17.501
If it's moved,
it's usual 3-something.

00:39:17.501 --> 00:39:21.801
If it's 301, it's permanent.
If it's 302, it's temporary.

00:39:21.801 --> 00:39:23.968
So imagine that you've just
moved your Website

00:39:23.968 --> 00:39:25.901
for, you know, a few weeks.

00:39:25.901 --> 00:39:27.667
That's the perfect time
to use a 302,

00:39:27.667 --> 00:39:29.400
if you're going to be coming
back to it.

00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:31.501
Um, a lot of people
who do banner ads

00:39:31.501 --> 00:39:33.334
will do 302s,
things like that.

00:39:33.334 --> 00:39:34.701
But if you have moved
your site--

00:39:34.701 --> 00:39:38.400
if you have truly moved it
from sitea.com to siteb.com

00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:40.300
and you're never planning
on going back,

00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:42.434
that's when you can use a 301.

00:39:42.434 --> 00:39:44.734
And then all the page rank
flows, and everybody's happy,

00:39:44.734 --> 00:39:46.834
and your rankings are preserved
and all that sort of stuff.

00:39:46.834 --> 00:39:48.334
And you can do an internal 301.

00:39:48.334 --> 00:39:50.267
That means if you go
to the non-www,

00:39:50.267 --> 00:39:52.167
you get a 301 to the www.

00:39:52.167 --> 00:39:53.167
So that's really nice.

00:39:53.167 --> 00:39:54.400
You're not linking to it.

00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:56.434
You're just--voosh--immediately
taken in there.

00:39:56.434 --> 00:39:58.033
And a lot of sites
like Slashdot.

00:39:58.033 --> 00:39:59.501
If you go to www.slashdot,

00:39:59.501 --> 00:40:01.567
it'll probably redirect you
to just slashdot.

00:40:01.567 --> 00:40:02.734
And that's pretty smart.

00:40:02.734 --> 00:40:04.801
Then people
can't really get mixed up.

00:40:04.801 --> 00:40:06.901
If you try to link to it
and you visit it,

00:40:06.901 --> 00:40:08.567
you'll get redirected
to the non-www

00:40:08.567 --> 00:40:10.734
and then you end up usually
linking to the non-www.

00:40:10.734 --> 00:40:11.901
So that's a great way
to take care

00:40:11.901 --> 00:40:13.667
of those
sort of duplicate issues.

00:40:13.667 --> 00:40:15.167
White: I'll add to that too.
Cutts: Yeah.

00:40:15.167 --> 00:40:16.901
White: A number of Web hosts
have already taken care

00:40:16.901 --> 00:40:17.901
of that for you.

00:40:17.901 --> 00:40:19.968
On my Web host, um, I found

00:40:19.968 --> 00:40:22.968
that when I typed
a non-www-version domain name,

00:40:22.968 --> 00:40:25.100
it automatically
redirected over or vice versa.

00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:27.501
So that's sometimes
taken care of for you.

00:40:27.501 --> 00:40:30.968
I want to make a plug, too,
for Live HTTP Headers extension

00:40:30.968 --> 00:40:32.033
in Firefox.

00:40:32.033 --> 00:40:33.701
Does anyone use that?
Raise your hand.

00:40:33.701 --> 00:40:35.701
Yeah. That's a--
That's a nice one.

00:40:35.701 --> 00:40:38.567
Briefly, it lets you see
the requests and the responses

00:40:38.567 --> 00:40:40.767
between the browser
and the server.

00:40:40.767 --> 00:40:43.067
In--In effect,
you are kind of--

00:40:43.067 --> 00:40:44.734
I don't know
a better way to say it--

00:40:44.734 --> 00:40:46.501
but wiretapping
your own, uh, connection

00:40:46.501 --> 00:40:47.767
between the servers.

00:40:47.767 --> 00:40:50.000
So you can actually see,
um, what the response codes

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:51.067
that come through.

00:40:51.067 --> 00:40:52.501
You can do--
Use Matt's version.

00:40:52.501 --> 00:40:54.000
Telnet. You can use
Live HTTP Headers

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:55.701
and make sure
that 301 is happening

00:40:55.701 --> 00:40:58.667
from www to non-www
or vice versa.

00:40:58.667 --> 00:41:00.467
So, yeah, that's something
you can add.

00:41:00.467 --> 00:41:01.868
Cutts: It's a really
useful tool.

00:41:01.868 --> 00:41:04.000
You would be amazed
at how many sites

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:07.601
return very strange stuff,
um, you know, in the headers.

00:41:07.601 --> 00:41:09.734
And so if you're looking at
those headers, you're realizing,

00:41:09.734 --> 00:41:11.234
"Oh, something strange
is going on."

00:41:11.234 --> 00:41:12.667
And you can do it yourself.

00:41:12.667 --> 00:41:14.734
You can go down to the wire
and Telnet and all that stuff.

00:41:14.734 --> 00:41:16.567
But it's much easier
if it's just a Firefox add-on.

00:41:16.567 --> 00:41:17.734
So it's a lot of fun.

00:41:17.734 --> 00:41:19.901
One more plug,
and I don't want to--

00:41:19.901 --> 00:41:22.234
We are at a Google conference,
so I don't want to be, you know,

00:41:22.234 --> 00:41:25.567
too salesy, but there's
google.com/webmasters.

00:41:25.567 --> 00:41:26.901
That's the Webmaster console.

00:41:26.901 --> 00:41:29.000
If you haven't registered,

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:30.701
it's not negligence
if you don't use it,

00:41:30.701 --> 00:41:33.434
but it's a really, really,
really useful tool.

00:41:33.434 --> 00:41:36.501
For example, if you say,
"Okay, I own mattcutts.com,"

00:41:36.501 --> 00:41:38.734
we have an option
where you can say,

00:41:38.734 --> 00:41:42.334
"What's my preference,
www.mattcutts.com or non-www?"

00:41:42.334 --> 00:41:44.267
We also show you errors
that we found

00:41:44.267 --> 00:41:45.801
when Googlebot crawled.

00:41:45.801 --> 00:41:48.133
We even showed you
how long the latency is

00:41:48.133 --> 00:41:50.801
for Google to fetch pages
from your site.

00:41:50.801 --> 00:41:52.334
So if you're having
server issues,

00:41:52.334 --> 00:41:53.901
you can sometimes
diagnose it.

00:41:53.901 --> 00:41:56.367
So we'll show you all kinds
of really useful information.

00:41:56.367 --> 00:41:58.901
And the ability to set
that sort of www or non-www

00:41:58.901 --> 00:42:00.901
is very helpful
in that kind of case.

00:42:00.901 --> 00:42:02.634
Question. Yeah.
At the microphone, yeah.

00:42:02.634 --> 00:42:05.367
man: Um, yeah,
the, um, question before

00:42:05.367 --> 00:42:07.000
about variants in--

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:10.033
Um, for example,
I use Analytics extensively.

00:42:10.033 --> 00:42:11.267
Cutts: Mm-hmm.

00:42:11.267 --> 00:42:13.334
man: And I'll get a return
for the URL--

00:42:13.334 --> 00:42:17.868
the URL plus, uh, index.htm--

00:42:17.868 --> 00:42:19.300
um, several variants.

00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:21.200
And I don't think
that's a question--

00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:23.467
I think I'm consistent
within the Website.

00:42:23.467 --> 00:42:24.601
Cutts: Mm-hmm.

00:42:24.601 --> 00:42:27.267
man: But, um,
which kind of contradicts

00:42:27.267 --> 00:42:28.901
what you just said.

00:42:28.901 --> 00:42:30.901
Cutts: Oh, no, you always
want to be consistent

00:42:30.901 --> 00:42:32.067
if you can.

00:42:32.067 --> 00:42:35.033
man: Yeah, but I mean,
those external accesses,

00:42:35.033 --> 00:42:39.567
how did they, um, decide,
you know,

00:42:39.567 --> 00:42:42.534
to access my Website when
I was consistent internally,

00:42:42.534 --> 00:42:43.734
I guess, is the question.

00:42:43.734 --> 00:42:45.334
Cutts:
So most of the time,

00:42:45.334 --> 00:42:47.434
it's just people
are not that skilled.

00:42:47.434 --> 00:42:49.734
Like, they're going to link
to Slashdot,

00:42:49.734 --> 00:42:52.167
and so they just assume
it's www.slashdot,

00:42:52.167 --> 00:42:55.000
even though Slashdot
wanted to be without the www.

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:56.567
So a lot of the times,
if people--

00:42:56.567 --> 00:42:58.000
You would be amazed
at how many people

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:00.067
will link to you
with broken stuff.

00:43:00.067 --> 00:43:02.734
In fact, you know, to plug
the Google Webmaster console,

00:43:02.734 --> 00:43:05.000
we will show you
all the backlinks to your site.

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:07.934
And we'll also show you
all the 404s on your site.

00:43:07.934 --> 00:43:10.067
So one of the best tips
that I always give is,

00:43:10.067 --> 00:43:11.801
if you would like free links--

00:43:11.801 --> 00:43:14.534
and most people on the Web
would like free links--

00:43:14.534 --> 00:43:16.267
you can go to this tool
and you can say,

00:43:16.267 --> 00:43:18.767
"Who are the people
who link to 404 pages?"

00:43:18.767 --> 00:43:20.400
And they're going to be
very reputable people.

00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:22.901
There was, uh--
ZDNet had linked to my site,

00:43:22.901 --> 00:43:24.868
and they'd linked to a page
that didn't exist

00:43:24.868 --> 00:43:26.901
with, like,
two trailing slashes.

00:43:26.901 --> 00:43:28.267
And so if you contact
that reporter

00:43:28.267 --> 00:43:30.267
and you say, "Hey, uh, you know,
double slashes

00:43:30.267 --> 00:43:33.300
on the Internet are weird,
just link to the normal page,"

00:43:33.300 --> 00:43:34.567
hey, free link.

00:43:34.567 --> 00:43:37.133
Now it's not a 404 page.
It links right to me.

00:43:37.133 --> 00:43:39.868
The fact is, anybody can link
to anybody else on the Web.

00:43:39.868 --> 00:43:43.067
So we don't penalize people
if a spammer links to you.

00:43:43.067 --> 00:43:44.801
The nice thing is,
if someone links to you

00:43:44.801 --> 00:43:46.234
that you normally link to
correctly,

00:43:46.234 --> 00:43:48.200
but they don't always
link to you correctly,

00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:49.968
by being consistent
with your internal linking,

00:43:49.968 --> 00:43:51.100
you try to prevent

00:43:51.100 --> 00:43:53.634
at least the worst of stuff
from happening.

00:43:53.634 --> 00:43:55.868
Good question.
Yeah. Another question.

00:43:55.868 --> 00:43:58.934
woman: Um, we, uh, work
at the University of California,

00:43:58.934 --> 00:44:00.968
and we're not allowed
to use some Google tools

00:44:00.968 --> 00:44:03.200
because of an indemnity clause.

00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:05.133
And I'm wondering
if there's an indemnity clause

00:44:05.133 --> 00:44:07.334
associated
with the Webmasters.

00:44:07.334 --> 00:44:09.400
Cutts: Uh, that's
an excellent question.

00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:11.267
Catch me and get
my contact info afterwards,

00:44:11.267 --> 00:44:13.100
and I'll--I'll try
and look it up for you.

00:44:13.100 --> 00:44:14.868
Yeah, this is one thing
that, um--

00:44:14.868 --> 00:44:17.200
I talk to a lot of government
Webmasters, right?

00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:19.567
'Cause they're like,
"Okay, we would like to find out

00:44:19.567 --> 00:44:21.667
"what the broken links are
on our site,

00:44:21.667 --> 00:44:24.801
but, you know, bureaucracy
can get a little overwhelming."

00:44:24.801 --> 00:44:27.234
And so sometimes people
literally just go rogue.

00:44:27.234 --> 00:44:28.667
They're like,
"I'm just going to prove

00:44:28.667 --> 00:44:29.767
"that I own this Website.

00:44:29.767 --> 00:44:31.100
"I'm going to edit
this meta tag.

00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:32.167
"No one needs to know.

00:44:32.167 --> 00:44:33.434
"Okay, now I'll log out.

00:44:33.434 --> 00:44:34.968
And I have
the information I need."

00:44:34.968 --> 00:44:37.067
And I'm not condoning that.
I'm not sanctioning that.

00:44:37.067 --> 00:44:39.868
I'm just saying a lot of people,
turns out, they do that.

00:44:39.868 --> 00:44:41.934
Uh, but everybody has different,
you know, restrictions

00:44:41.934 --> 00:44:44.400
on when they are
or aren't allowed to do it.

00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:46.834
Um, I'll have to check
on whether we have some sort

00:44:46.834 --> 00:44:48.968
of indemnity clause
on--on Webmaster central.

00:44:48.968 --> 00:44:50.868
Good question.
Another question. Yeah.

00:44:50.868 --> 00:44:53.901
man: Hi. Um, interesting
that you're from Omaha.

00:44:53.901 --> 00:44:57.167
We just, uh--we sold our company
a couple of years ago, NetShops.

00:44:57.167 --> 00:45:00.234
Um, and because
of non-competes,

00:45:00.234 --> 00:45:03.868
we--we really couldn't sell
much of anything online.

00:45:03.868 --> 00:45:06.501
So we started
that racy.com site.

00:45:06.501 --> 00:45:08.767
And I understand
why you didn't put it up.

00:45:08.767 --> 00:45:11.167
But I-I'm very, very curious,

00:45:11.167 --> 00:45:15.634
are we starting from a hole
because we're trying to--

00:45:15.634 --> 00:45:18.501
Uh, it's not pornographic,
but it's on the edge.

00:45:18.501 --> 00:45:21.200
And I'm just wondering
what, uh--what the take--

00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:23.667
is it--is they're also history
of the domain name

00:45:23.667 --> 00:45:25.467
that is bringing
along problems?

00:45:25.467 --> 00:45:28.634
And how, uh--
how can we resolve--

00:45:28.634 --> 00:45:30.901
What--What should we do
in this situation?

00:45:30.901 --> 00:45:32.334
Cutts: Absolutely.
Very fun question.

00:45:32.334 --> 00:45:34.234
So we took a bunch
of submissions.

00:45:34.234 --> 00:45:37.567
Um, one of the submissions
was racy.com,

00:45:37.567 --> 00:45:39.234
which I have no problem with.

00:45:39.234 --> 00:45:40.234
I put it up, you know,

00:45:40.234 --> 00:45:41.601
in our internal
training session.

00:45:41.601 --> 00:45:42.701
We were looking at it.

00:45:42.701 --> 00:45:44.701
There's some
pretty explicit stuff.

00:45:44.701 --> 00:45:47.000
In fact, last night
I was trying to find some part

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:50.501
of the site that would be safe,
you know, to project.

00:45:50.501 --> 00:45:52.434
And I was like,
"This is a little--"

00:45:52.434 --> 00:45:53.601
It's not radioactive.

00:45:53.601 --> 00:45:54.868
It's just, like,
there will always be

00:45:54.868 --> 00:45:56.133
a couple objectionable words,

00:45:56.133 --> 00:45:58.000
so I decided to not put it up
on the projector.

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:00.734
Uh, but as I recall,
you had good URL structure.

00:46:00.734 --> 00:46:03.367
So let me turn that
into a more general question.

00:46:03.367 --> 00:46:04.734
I just bought a domain,

00:46:04.734 --> 00:46:06.567
and I'm worried
the previous owner might've done

00:46:06.567 --> 00:46:08.334
something unsavory with it.

00:46:08.334 --> 00:46:10.234
It turns out, in your case,
that didn't happen.

00:46:10.234 --> 00:46:11.334
But here's what you can do,

00:46:11.334 --> 00:46:15.367
go to archive.org
and look at www.racy.com

00:46:15.367 --> 00:46:17.701
or example.com
or whatever your site is

00:46:17.701 --> 00:46:19.267
over history.

00:46:19.267 --> 00:46:21.267
In fact, if you're thinking
about buying a domain name--

00:46:21.267 --> 00:46:23.033
and we have seen people
buy domain names

00:46:23.033 --> 00:46:25.234
where a spammer took it,

00:46:25.234 --> 00:46:28.167
and they burned it
to the ground, right?

00:46:28.167 --> 00:46:30.067
They just did everything.
They spammed--

00:46:30.067 --> 00:46:32.567
You remember the, uh...

00:46:32.567 --> 00:46:36.067
this--this--this guy--

00:46:36.067 --> 00:46:38.000
Where's my spammer?
There's my spammer.

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:40.000
Blogsense.biz.

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:42.434
A lot of the times,
people will buy this domain,

00:46:42.434 --> 00:46:45.767
spam the hell out of it,
do as much stuff as they can,

00:46:45.767 --> 00:46:47.200
and as soon
as all the search engines

00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:50.267
have caught them and, like,
deconstructed their spam house

00:46:50.267 --> 00:46:52.133
brick by brick
and buried the bricks

00:46:52.133 --> 00:46:53.934
in different places
and then salted the ground

00:46:53.934 --> 00:46:56.868
so that this domain
does not rank well, right?

00:46:56.868 --> 00:46:59.434
Then they try to sell
the domain, right?

00:46:59.434 --> 00:47:01.934
And a lot of the times, if your
traffic is going like this

00:47:01.934 --> 00:47:03.467
and then the search engines
find your spam

00:47:03.467 --> 00:47:04.934
and it goes like this,

00:47:04.934 --> 00:47:07.734
they'll take a picture
when the traffic was like this.

00:47:07.734 --> 00:47:09.868
And they'll be like, "Oh, yeah,
look at our rankings.

00:47:09.868 --> 00:47:11.334
They're really climbing."

00:47:11.334 --> 00:47:14.868
So the way to protect yourself
against that is a couple things.

00:47:14.868 --> 00:47:16.601
Go to archive.org and search,

00:47:16.601 --> 00:47:18.400
and you can see the historical
amount of information

00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:19.534
about the domain.

00:47:19.534 --> 00:47:20.834
You can see
what the domain looked like

00:47:20.834 --> 00:47:22.100
three years ago
or four years ago

00:47:22.100 --> 00:47:23.367
or five years ago.

00:47:23.367 --> 00:47:26.067
The other thing is,
just do a search for the domain.

00:47:26.067 --> 00:47:30.767
I think I can do a search
for racy.com,

00:47:30.767 --> 00:47:33.734
um...

00:47:33.734 --> 00:47:36.367
as a phrase, right?

00:47:36.367 --> 00:47:37.834
So racy.com
is right at number one.

00:47:37.834 --> 00:47:39.100
That's a good sign.

00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:41.133
And you'll notice
now you have dictionaries,

00:47:41.133 --> 00:47:42.567
that sort of stuff.

00:47:42.567 --> 00:47:45.300
If what you see is people
complaining about your site,

00:47:45.300 --> 00:47:47.567
people saying,
"Oh, I can't believe racy.com.

00:47:47.567 --> 00:47:49.567
Those guys are spammers,"
or something like that,

00:47:49.567 --> 00:47:50.934
then I would be worried.

00:47:50.934 --> 00:47:52.601
But in fact, I don't think
that you necessarily

00:47:52.601 --> 00:47:54.367
have any issue with the previous
owners having issues

00:47:54.367 --> 00:47:55.400
or something like that.

00:47:55.400 --> 00:47:56.567
Feel free to catch me
afterwards,

00:47:56.567 --> 00:47:58.868
and we can talk
about it more then.

00:47:58.868 --> 00:48:00.701
Okay, more questions
from the audience?

00:48:00.701 --> 00:48:02.434
Yeah, come on up to the mic.

00:48:02.434 --> 00:48:05.067
I'm figuring you guys prefer
a little more interactivity,

00:48:05.067 --> 00:48:06.167
but I'm pretty--

00:48:06.167 --> 00:48:08.234
man: I have two questions.
Cutts: Cool.

00:48:08.234 --> 00:48:11.767
man: Do you treat 500 responses
different from 502s?

00:48:11.767 --> 00:48:13.567
Cutts: Mm-hmm.

00:48:13.567 --> 00:48:17.634
man: The second one
is, um, images.

00:48:17.634 --> 00:48:19.567
Do you guy--
How--how would a--

00:48:19.567 --> 00:48:21.534
Let's say we have
a thumbnail version,

00:48:21.534 --> 00:48:23.067
and we have a full version.

00:48:23.067 --> 00:48:25.701
And we prefer you index
the full version,

00:48:25.701 --> 00:48:26.968
but we're only showing
the thumbnail

00:48:26.968 --> 00:48:28.701
on a particular article.

00:48:28.701 --> 00:48:32.667
You can see an example
of that on ehow.com.

00:48:32.667 --> 00:48:33.834
Cutts:
Yeah, absolutely.

00:48:33.834 --> 00:48:35.300
So 500 versus 502--

00:48:35.300 --> 00:48:36.567
if you want
to catch me afterwards--

00:48:36.567 --> 00:48:38.234
I think that we do
treat those separately,

00:48:38.234 --> 00:48:40.267
but I'm not 100% sure.

00:48:40.267 --> 00:48:43.801
Um, there's a lot of different
HTTP status codes.

00:48:43.801 --> 00:48:45.901
So 300s typically stand
for redirects.

00:48:45.901 --> 00:48:47.701
200 usually means okay.

00:48:47.701 --> 00:48:49.400
You know,
400 is some sort of error.

00:48:49.400 --> 00:48:51.634
And then, you know,
they mean different things.

00:48:51.634 --> 00:48:54.734
Um, typically whenever
we're doing image searches--

00:48:54.734 --> 00:48:58.267
so let's do an image search
for flowers--

00:48:58.267 --> 00:49:02.000
um, we will try to find
the best picture that we can.

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:05.067
And if there's a thumbnail,
we will do our best to say,

00:49:05.067 --> 00:49:07.133
"Okay, let's find the one
that's a little bit bigger,"

00:49:07.133 --> 00:49:09.000
because users are typically
a little more interested

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:10.400
in the one that's bigger.

00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:12.567
One thing you can do is try
to shunt a little more page rank

00:49:12.567 --> 00:49:13.801
to the larger image.

00:49:13.801 --> 00:49:15.467
That can help out quite a bit.

00:49:15.467 --> 00:49:17.400
Um, we can also talk
about it offline too.

00:49:17.400 --> 00:49:19.968
Did you--Okay.
Yeah.

00:49:19.968 --> 00:49:22.801
man: Hi. I had a question
about a good site.

00:49:22.801 --> 00:49:24.167
If we could just look at a site

00:49:24.167 --> 00:49:26.000
that follows some
of the best practices.

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:29.234
And, uh--And I also had
another conference

00:49:29.234 --> 00:49:31.567
where they talked about video
being really important

00:49:31.567 --> 00:49:36.133
on a Website to boost, uh,
ranking and also indexing.

00:49:36.133 --> 00:49:37.400
Cutts:
Yeah, absolutely.

00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:41.067
So--And the funny thing is,
uh, what was it,

00:49:41.067 --> 00:49:45.767
Closebys--
I may have lost it.

00:49:45.767 --> 00:49:48.667
Um, Closebys actually had
a very high-production video,

00:49:48.667 --> 00:49:51.167
and they buried it,
like, six layers deep.

00:49:51.167 --> 00:49:53.868
So, uh, a lot of people
ask me, you know,

00:49:53.868 --> 00:49:56.000
"Hey, I want to get
number-one search rankings."

00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:57.767
It turns out,
sometimes it's easier

00:49:57.767 --> 00:49:59.167
to get number-one
search rankings

00:49:59.167 --> 00:50:02.067
by making a great video
or a great blog post

00:50:02.067 --> 00:50:04.701
or a great image
or something that's newsworthy

00:50:04.701 --> 00:50:06.934
rather than just a pure
Web page.

00:50:06.934 --> 00:50:09.234
Um, video, you would be amazed
at the sort of--

00:50:09.234 --> 00:50:11.000
you know,
if you go to YouTube--

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:14.767
the amount of traffic
that some videos can make.

00:50:14.767 --> 00:50:17.267
In fact, uh,
if I were to search

00:50:17.267 --> 00:50:22.200
for, uh, Google Webmaster
video channel--

00:50:22.200 --> 00:50:24.400
One thing that we've been
doing recently

00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:25.901
is not just recording--

00:50:25.901 --> 00:50:27.901
not just doing blog posts,
but doing videos.

00:50:27.901 --> 00:50:29.033
And they're fantastic,

00:50:29.033 --> 00:50:33.300
because you can take
a Flip, right?

00:50:33.300 --> 00:50:35.834
And Flip video costs...

00:50:37.567 --> 00:50:40.601
100 bucks,
a couple hundred bucks, right?

00:50:40.601 --> 00:50:42.601
And you can--I mean, it's like
the size of a cell phone.

00:50:42.601 --> 00:50:44.167
You can carry it
with you everywhere.

00:50:44.167 --> 00:50:46.100
And so if you see something
interesting at a conference,

00:50:46.100 --> 00:50:49.000
you just whip that out, and
you can video it very easily.

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:50.567
So there's no reason

00:50:50.567 --> 00:50:52.667
why you have to put a ton
of work into a blog post.

00:50:52.667 --> 00:50:55.067
Sometimes you can do it
a lot easier with a video.

00:50:55.067 --> 00:50:56.801
Uh, I was doing something
where I was hacking

00:50:56.801 --> 00:50:59.067
a Nintendo Wiimote.

00:50:59.067 --> 00:51:01.000
And I was like, "Oh, this
would look good with a video."

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:03.934
So you just whip out the Flip,
upload to YouTube.

00:51:03.934 --> 00:51:05.400
You're done in no time at all.

00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:07.200
So we've discovered
that doing--

00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:10.834
We've done something
like 50 different videos.

00:51:10.834 --> 00:51:13.767
And, um, what we do
is about every month or two,

00:51:13.767 --> 00:51:15.601
I take questions.

00:51:15.601 --> 00:51:18.167
So, you know, "How important
are brands and ranking?"

00:51:18.167 --> 00:51:20.434
"Does anchor text
carry through 301s?"

00:51:20.434 --> 00:51:22.267
I can answer that question
in a minute and a half

00:51:22.267 --> 00:51:24.400
instead of 20 minutes
or 40 minutes

00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:26.334
or an hour doing a blog post.

00:51:26.334 --> 00:51:27.868
And you can see, you know,

00:51:27.868 --> 00:51:31.000
14,000 people have watched
that first video.

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:32.434
So two minutes to make,

00:51:32.434 --> 00:51:34.300
and then you can get a ton
of views.

00:51:34.300 --> 00:51:36.901
Video is a very easy way,
where, if you are willing,

00:51:36.901 --> 00:51:38.067
if you have the ability--

00:51:38.067 --> 00:51:39.367
You have to worry
about indemnity.

00:51:39.367 --> 00:51:40.567
You have to think,

00:51:40.567 --> 00:51:42.234
"Do I have permission
to make these videos?"

00:51:42.234 --> 00:51:45.567
But if you do, you'd be amazed
at how viral they can go.

00:51:45.567 --> 00:51:47.701
Um, one tip that I learned--

00:51:47.701 --> 00:51:49.300
You notice
every single one of these

00:51:49.300 --> 00:51:51.968
has me in a red shirt, right?

00:51:51.968 --> 00:51:55.334
So I sat down, and I answered
30 questions all on one time.

00:51:55.334 --> 00:51:57.000
And by the end
of 30 days, everyb--

00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:58.501
I was doing one
of these videos a day.

00:51:58.501 --> 00:52:01.400
By the end, everybody was like,
"Okay, no more of the red shirt.

00:52:01.400 --> 00:52:04.133
"Please burn the red shirt.
"I'm so tired of this red shirt.

00:52:04.133 --> 00:52:05.467
Ah, I hate it."

00:52:05.467 --> 00:52:06.634
So I did another one recently.

00:52:06.634 --> 00:52:09.033
And I brought in eight
different T-shirts.

00:52:09.033 --> 00:52:10.400
And I do about five questions,

00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:12.567
and then I'd switch
to a different colored shirt.

00:52:12.567 --> 00:52:14.801
So, you know, these things
are very fast to make.

00:52:14.801 --> 00:52:16.534
You can make 30 or 40 in a day.

00:52:16.534 --> 00:52:18.167
And it can be a way
to rank really well.

00:52:18.167 --> 00:52:21.801
In fact, if you were
to do a search for my name,

00:52:21.801 --> 00:52:23.734
um, you'd probably get my blog.

00:52:23.734 --> 00:52:25.767
You'd get, maybe, you know,
something on Wikipedia

00:52:25.767 --> 00:52:27.100
or whatever.

00:52:27.100 --> 00:52:29.133
But you--There's something
like five videos ranking

00:52:29.133 --> 00:52:30.200
for my name.

00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:31.767
So it can be a very easy way
to rank.

00:52:31.767 --> 00:52:32.934
And there's not
that many people

00:52:32.934 --> 00:52:34.367
that are thinking
about making videos,

00:52:34.367 --> 00:52:36.501
so it can be
a really big opportunity.

00:52:36.501 --> 00:52:38.367
Yeah, another question
at the mic.

00:52:38.367 --> 00:52:41.567
man: Uh, well, our marketing
people really like PDFs,

00:52:41.567 --> 00:52:43.267
and so they create them first.

00:52:43.267 --> 00:52:46.267
And then, um--and then
I'm one of the people

00:52:46.267 --> 00:52:49.067
who turn them into HTML.

00:52:49.067 --> 00:52:50.767
And I keep telling them to do--

00:52:50.767 --> 00:52:53.467
You know, "We need to do it
the other way."

00:52:53.467 --> 00:52:59.767
Uh, could you speak
about PDFs versus HTML

00:52:59.767 --> 00:53:01.834
and what's likely
to be most searchable

00:53:01.834 --> 00:53:02.868
and et cetera?

00:53:02.868 --> 00:53:04.234
Cutts:
Absolutely.

00:53:04.234 --> 00:53:06.801
So--and just before I go on,
here's a couple videos.

00:53:06.801 --> 00:53:08.100
Qualities of a good site

00:53:08.100 --> 00:53:09.534
and the lightning round--
a bunch of questions.

00:53:09.534 --> 00:53:11.801
And that's ranking
with, like, no links

00:53:11.801 --> 00:53:15.400
compared to--these guys
might have hundreds of links.

00:53:15.400 --> 00:53:18.200
So videos can be
a really big opportunity.

00:53:18.200 --> 00:53:21.567
Um, yes. PDFs.

00:53:21.567 --> 00:53:24.667
Another one I get
is Flash, right?

00:53:24.667 --> 00:53:26.167
Um, I love Adobe.

00:53:26.167 --> 00:53:28.400
Adobe has done fantastic things.
Photoshop is cool.

00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:31.367
The plug-in aspect of Photoshop
was revolutionary.

00:53:31.367 --> 00:53:34.300
They do amazing things.
Postscript, fantastic.

00:53:34.300 --> 00:53:37.300
Flash and PDF
are both very, very cool.

00:53:37.300 --> 00:53:39.734
But they're not necessarily
native to the Web.

00:53:39.734 --> 00:53:42.067
And so people
can usually read PDFs,

00:53:42.067 --> 00:53:43.667
but not always.

00:53:43.667 --> 00:53:45.934
And you want it to be
as easy as possible

00:53:45.934 --> 00:53:47.801
for people to buy,
for people to learn,

00:53:47.801 --> 00:53:49.100
for people to do whatever it is

00:53:49.100 --> 00:53:51.000
you want them to do
on your site.

00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:52.901
So think about that
a little bit.

00:53:52.901 --> 00:53:54.734
I would totally agree
if you can make Web pages

00:53:54.734 --> 00:53:56.067
and then go to PDF,

00:53:56.067 --> 00:53:57.667
that can be
a lot more accessible.

00:53:57.667 --> 00:54:00.834
It's a lot easier to link
to an HTML page.

00:54:00.834 --> 00:54:03.534
So HTML pages tend
to attract more page rank

00:54:03.534 --> 00:54:04.734
a little bit faster,

00:54:04.734 --> 00:54:06.067
'cause people
have to link to PDF,

00:54:06.067 --> 00:54:07.534
and then they have to say
it's a PDF link,

00:54:07.534 --> 00:54:09.033
all that sort of stuff.

00:54:09.033 --> 00:54:11.767
And just on Flash for a minute--
Flash is fantastic.

00:54:11.767 --> 00:54:14.501
But it's better
to be decoration in the middle

00:54:14.501 --> 00:54:16.901
and not the entire site
in Flash.

00:54:16.901 --> 00:54:19.000
If you can make
static HTML links

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:21.434
that Googlebot or users
can click,

00:54:21.434 --> 00:54:22.901
that is so much better,

00:54:22.901 --> 00:54:25.000
because we can find
a lot of individual pages,

00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:26.801
which gives you a lot
of individual opportunities

00:54:26.801 --> 00:54:27.968
to rank.

00:54:27.968 --> 00:54:29.901
If it's just one big glob
of Flash,

00:54:29.901 --> 00:54:31.734
that's harder to link to.

00:54:31.734 --> 00:54:33.934
Anybody able to think
of another reason

00:54:33.934 --> 00:54:37.501
why you might not want
your entire site to be in Flash?

00:54:39.634 --> 00:54:42.467
Right? I have a G1,
and I have an iPhone.

00:54:42.467 --> 00:54:45.133
The iPhone
does not handle Flash well.

00:54:45.133 --> 00:54:46.934
And who knows
when that will change.

00:54:46.934 --> 00:54:49.067
So there's
a very great yogurt site--

00:54:49.067 --> 00:54:50.400
Pinkberry, right?

00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:53.000
And if you go to Pinkberry
on an iPhone,

00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:54.934
you're stuck
with a little Flash cube.

00:54:54.934 --> 00:54:56.934
You're like, "I want to know
where I can get yogurt.

00:54:56.934 --> 00:54:57.934
Give me the yogurt."

00:54:57.934 --> 00:54:59.667
And you can't find out.

00:54:59.667 --> 00:55:01.667
There's another site,
you know, Red Mango,

00:55:01.667 --> 00:55:02.868
and they do a better job.

00:55:02.868 --> 00:55:04.267
So, you know,
think about Flash.

00:55:04.267 --> 00:55:05.434
Think about PDFs.

00:55:05.434 --> 00:55:07.667
If you can do it in a Web way,

00:55:07.667 --> 00:55:10.200
I would start with a Web page
and then go to PDF.

00:55:10.200 --> 00:55:11.534
Feel free to say,
"Yeah, Matt said so,"

00:55:11.534 --> 00:55:13.367
or something like that
if it carries any weight.

00:55:13.367 --> 00:55:14.734
Often it doesn't.

00:55:14.734 --> 00:55:16.067
Question. Yeah.

00:55:16.067 --> 00:55:19.000
man: I had a question.
Can you explain how the pa--

00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:21.534
Google decides
to index a page or not?

00:55:21.534 --> 00:55:24.801
I've noticed the page number
in our site up and down,

00:55:24.801 --> 00:55:27.467
even though the content
has not changed.

00:55:27.467 --> 00:55:28.767
Cutts:
Absolutely.

00:55:28.767 --> 00:55:32.968
Um, the short answer is Google
basically uses page rank

00:55:32.968 --> 00:55:36.200
to decide which pages to crawl
and how fast to crawl.

00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:37.634
So in the early days,

00:55:37.634 --> 00:55:40.400
you could almost think of it
as sorting by page rank.

00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:43.667
Stanford.edu, CNN,
"New York Times"--

00:55:43.667 --> 00:55:45.634
tons of people link
to these sites.

00:55:45.634 --> 00:55:47.734
And so we start crawling
with those sites.

00:55:47.734 --> 00:55:49.834
And then you find all the links
from"New York Times,"

00:55:49.834 --> 00:55:51.534
and you go outward like that.

00:55:51.534 --> 00:55:54.200
So it's almost entirely--
at least in the beginning--

00:55:54.200 --> 00:55:56.067
a matter of how many links
there were

00:55:56.067 --> 00:55:57.868
and what the importance
of those links were.

00:55:57.868 --> 00:55:59.000
And by the way,

00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:00.868
page rank is not just the number
of links, right?

00:56:00.868 --> 00:56:04.133
Like, if ten people link
to Greg's Web page

00:56:04.133 --> 00:56:06.000
and 15 people link
to my Web page,

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:08.601
you might be like,
"Aha, I got 15 links."

00:56:08.601 --> 00:56:10.734
But if his ten links
are "New York Times,"

00:56:10.734 --> 00:56:12.067
CNN, "Reader's Digest,"

00:56:12.067 --> 00:56:15.400
and my 15 links
are my college buddies,

00:56:15.400 --> 00:56:16.968
he's going to have
more page rank.

00:56:16.968 --> 00:56:18.868
So we're going to crawl
his page first.

00:56:18.868 --> 00:56:21.400
And the same thing applies
to refresh policies.

00:56:21.400 --> 00:56:24.367
So we're more likely
to visit stanford.edu,

00:56:24.367 --> 00:56:25.634
you know, once a day

00:56:25.634 --> 00:56:27.467
to figure out
that a page has changed

00:56:27.467 --> 00:56:29.934
than we are somebody
that nobody ever links to.

00:56:29.934 --> 00:56:31.968
That said, we try to do
a very good job of crawling

00:56:31.968 --> 00:56:33.767
as much of the Web as we can.

00:56:33.767 --> 00:56:36.767
Even if you don't have any links
at all on your dot-com,

00:56:36.767 --> 00:56:38.901
we can often still discover
your site.

00:56:38.901 --> 00:56:41.467
You can always submit your URL
and things like that.

00:56:41.467 --> 00:56:43.701
But the more people
that do know about you,

00:56:43.701 --> 00:56:45.501
the more we're often able
to crawl

00:56:45.501 --> 00:56:47.200
and the more often
we're able to crawl you.

00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:49.434
So typically, we can refresh
our entire index

00:56:49.434 --> 00:56:53.267
on a weekly or, at worst case,
a monthly sort of basis.

00:56:53.267 --> 00:56:54.467
Another question.
Yeah.

00:56:54.467 --> 00:56:56.467
man: I just had
a couple quick questions.

00:56:56.467 --> 00:56:59.000
Uh, one of them regarding
Google image search.

00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:00.400
Where do you guys--

00:57:00.400 --> 00:57:02.267
What--What text do you look for
to actually index the image on?

00:57:02.267 --> 00:57:04.033
Is it just the ALT text
and image tag,

00:57:04.033 --> 00:57:05.367
or maybe like title text,

00:57:05.367 --> 00:57:08.167
or do you actually take stuff
previous and after it?

00:57:08.167 --> 00:57:09.834
Cutts: The short answer is
we're willing to look

00:57:09.834 --> 00:57:11.234
wherever we can find
useful data.

00:57:11.234 --> 00:57:12.367
So, I mean, in theory,

00:57:12.367 --> 00:57:14.567
you could look at the title
of the URL,

00:57:14.567 --> 00:57:16.267
definitely stuff surrounding
the page,

00:57:16.267 --> 00:57:18.000
absolutely the ALT text.

00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:21.601
Um, it's very hard to understand
the actual content of images.

00:57:21.601 --> 00:57:23.400
Google just released
on Google Labs

00:57:23.400 --> 00:57:25.767
something that lets you sort
by image similarity.

00:57:25.767 --> 00:57:27.167
So you can start
with the Eiffel Tower,

00:57:27.167 --> 00:57:29.634
and it will show you other
pictures of the Eiffel Tower.

00:57:29.634 --> 00:57:31.634
We also have something where,
on Google image search,

00:57:31.634 --> 00:57:33.567
you can say, "Show me faces."

00:57:33.567 --> 00:57:35.400
So you can do a search
like "Paris."

00:57:35.400 --> 00:57:36.567
And then click
"show me faces,"

00:57:36.567 --> 00:57:38.501
and you'll only get
Paris Hilton.

00:57:38.501 --> 00:57:40.133
So we do a little bit
of image understanding,

00:57:40.133 --> 00:57:41.567
but most of the time,

00:57:41.567 --> 00:57:44.267
it's text around or within
the metadata of the image,

00:57:44.267 --> 00:57:45.400
that sort of stuff.

00:57:45.400 --> 00:57:46.801
The more descriptive stuff
you can have,

00:57:46.801 --> 00:57:49.100
instead of, like,
if you call your .jpg

00:57:49.100 --> 00:57:51.767
dsc129.jpg,

00:57:51.767 --> 00:57:54.634
that's not as helpful
as flower.jpg.

00:57:54.634 --> 00:57:57.334
So think about all that stuff
and try to incorporate the data.

00:57:57.334 --> 00:57:59.400
man: And if you throw
an image tag in an H1 tag,

00:57:59.400 --> 00:58:01.901
will it get more authority
like the ALT tags do?

00:58:01.901 --> 00:58:03.234
Cutts:
This is a common question.

00:58:03.234 --> 00:58:06.501
H1, you know, is bigger
on the page than H2,

00:58:06.501 --> 00:58:07.868
which is bigger than H3.

00:58:07.868 --> 00:58:09.167
And so a lot of SEOs
are really, like,

00:58:09.167 --> 00:58:11.667
"Okay, everything's
going to be in H1."

00:58:11.667 --> 00:58:13.400
And it's kind of nice
we have this page up, right?

00:58:13.400 --> 00:58:14.734
It's the same attitude.

00:58:14.734 --> 00:58:17.000
I'm going to say the word
furniture 40,000 times.

00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:18.400
I'm really about furniture.

00:58:18.400 --> 00:58:20.934
If you type in furniture,
you have to return me, Google.

00:58:20.934 --> 00:58:22.100
And we don't buy that.

00:58:22.100 --> 00:58:24.767
So if you put
your entire page in H1,

00:58:24.767 --> 00:58:26.534
uh, we're not going to give it
the same weight

00:58:26.534 --> 00:58:28.267
that we'd give, like, two
or three words.

00:58:28.267 --> 00:58:29.868
So we try to be pretty,
you know,

00:58:29.868 --> 00:58:31.434
intelligent about that.

00:58:31.434 --> 00:58:33.067
I would just do whatever
is natural.

00:58:33.067 --> 00:58:34.701
You know, it's natural
to have an H1,

00:58:34.701 --> 00:58:36.501
have a few sections,
have a few words,

00:58:36.501 --> 00:58:37.901
and have an H2.

00:58:37.901 --> 00:58:40.834
I wouldn't try to use CSS
to make the whole page H1,

00:58:40.834 --> 00:58:42.934
because we do a pretty good job
of detecting that.

00:58:42.934 --> 00:58:44.267
Yeah.
Another question.

00:58:44.267 --> 00:58:47.167
man: Yeah. So I-I guess
what I'm hearing from you,

00:58:47.167 --> 00:58:50.667
that if you, say, have a page--
you have, like, an index.php,

00:58:50.667 --> 00:58:54.133
and you give it query parameters
like page=something,

00:58:54.133 --> 00:58:56.367
that's worse than if you had
separate pages,

00:58:56.367 --> 00:58:59.901
you know, like, you know,
whatever, index.php

00:58:59.901 --> 00:59:02.501
and, you know, item,
you know, or, like, you know,

00:59:02.501 --> 00:59:05.000
iTrip or whatever .php,
stuff like that.

00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:06.067
Cutts: Yeah.

00:59:06.067 --> 00:59:08.200
So that's
a fantastic question.

00:59:08.200 --> 00:59:12.367
Imagine this page
is index.php

00:59:12.367 --> 00:59:15.300
and val1 or, you know,

00:59:15.300 --> 00:59:18.634
item1=val1

00:59:18.634 --> 00:59:22.167
and item2=val2

00:59:22.167 --> 00:59:23.767
and you go on and on and on
like that.

00:59:23.767 --> 00:59:26.300
It used to be that Google
would only crawl URLs

00:59:26.300 --> 00:59:28.767
if there were, like, one
or two parameters in the URL.

00:59:28.767 --> 00:59:30.100
We continue to get better.

00:59:30.100 --> 00:59:32.334
So you can have 15 parameters
in the URL,

00:59:32.334 --> 00:59:33.801
and we can still crawl that.

00:59:33.801 --> 00:59:36.200
Like, if you looked at some
of the weird URL structure

00:59:36.200 --> 00:59:39.200
we had with exclamation points
in it, we'll still crawl that.

00:59:39.200 --> 00:59:41.033
But in general,
for most search engines,

00:59:41.033 --> 00:59:44.133
if you can make something
that's relatively static,

00:59:44.133 --> 00:59:45.968
instead of having
15 parameters,

00:59:45.968 --> 00:59:47.467
it's easier to crawl,

00:59:47.467 --> 00:59:49.267
because if you think about it,
you know,

00:59:49.267 --> 00:59:50.567
if you have 15 parameters,

00:59:50.567 --> 00:59:53.634
usually at least a few
of those parameters do nothing.

00:59:53.634 --> 00:59:55.634
So if you take
that parameter out,

00:59:55.634 --> 00:59:57.667
you get the same URL.

00:59:57.667 --> 00:59:59.601
And now you've got weird
duplicate content issues

00:59:59.601 --> 01:00:02.968
where the same content is
presented on two different URLs.

01:00:02.968 --> 01:00:05.300
So as much as you can reduce
those extra parameters

01:00:05.300 --> 01:00:06.634
if you don't need them,

01:00:06.634 --> 01:00:10.067
and, you know, if I were
looking back at this guy,

01:00:10.067 --> 01:00:12.667
rather than having
all these--whoops--

01:00:12.667 --> 01:00:14.501
rather than having
all these weird terms,

01:00:14.501 --> 01:00:19.334
again, if it could be
/audi/s4/2006,

01:00:19.334 --> 01:00:21.667
that's so much more
understandable for a user.

01:00:21.667 --> 01:00:23.133
So I think
that can really be useful.

01:00:23.133 --> 01:00:24.467
It can--
you know, it can help out.

01:00:24.467 --> 01:00:25.734
We do give
a little bit of weight

01:00:25.734 --> 01:00:27.434
for keywords in the URL.

01:00:27.434 --> 01:00:29.434
It's not like
that's the secret.

01:00:29.434 --> 01:00:31.801
You put a keyword in the URL
and now I rank number one.

01:00:31.801 --> 01:00:33.367
But every little bit helps.

01:00:33.367 --> 01:00:35.534
So if you can have a few things
that make sense for users,

01:00:35.534 --> 01:00:36.934
where they can see the URL

01:00:36.934 --> 01:00:38.701
and get rid of these sort
of multiple parameters,

01:00:38.701 --> 01:00:40.200
it does help a little bit.

01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:42.834
And I think we're pretty close
to the end of the session.

01:00:42.834 --> 01:00:45.334
How about
one last question.

01:00:45.334 --> 01:00:48.601
man: We put a database online
that was unique information.

01:00:48.601 --> 01:00:49.701
We just did it.

01:00:49.701 --> 01:00:52.133
And I know the guidelines
about length

01:00:52.133 --> 01:00:53.634
and number of links,

01:00:53.634 --> 01:00:55.200
but are those
just guidelines?

01:00:55.200 --> 01:00:57.100
Can we break that
in a situation

01:00:57.100 --> 01:00:58.467
that requires it?

01:00:58.467 --> 01:00:59.634
Cutts:
Very good question.

01:00:59.634 --> 01:01:01.200
So if you look
at Google's guidelines,

01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:05.434
there's one thing that says,
"Avoid having over 100 links."

01:01:05.434 --> 01:01:07.434
And that's not
in our spam guidelines.

01:01:07.434 --> 01:01:09.801
We're not going to penalize you
if you have over 100 links.

01:01:09.801 --> 01:01:11.801
That's in a different section.

01:01:11.801 --> 01:01:13.534
The reason
why we said that originally

01:01:13.534 --> 01:01:16.234
is because we used
to only crawl 101 kilobytes.

01:01:16.234 --> 01:01:19.000
And so we didn't want people
having a four-megabyte file.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.334
Remember, when you have
a one-megabyte image download,

01:01:21.334 --> 01:01:23.067
that can be really
kind of a pain.

01:01:23.067 --> 01:01:24.667
So originally,
we recommended 100 links

01:01:24.667 --> 01:01:27.400
just so that people wouldn't
have their pages be too big.

01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:28.801
Now we crawl a lot more--

01:01:28.801 --> 01:01:31.901
We'll save a lot more
than 101 kilobytes of your page.

01:01:31.901 --> 01:01:34.133
So that guideline
is getting a little stale.

01:01:34.133 --> 01:01:37.167
You know, having up to hundreds
of links on your page is okay.

01:01:37.167 --> 01:01:40.267
What you really don't want
is a ton of really spammy links.

01:01:40.267 --> 01:01:41.567
You know, the sort of thing

01:01:41.567 --> 01:01:44.467
like, uh,
the blogsearch.biz guy,

01:01:44.467 --> 01:01:45.601
like this.

01:01:45.601 --> 01:01:47.734
If you had 100 links
like this,

01:01:47.734 --> 01:01:49.734
that would get really,
really annoying.

01:01:49.734 --> 01:01:51.667
But if you
have just normal links,

01:01:51.667 --> 01:01:54.734
that I wouldn't necessarily
worry that much about.

01:01:54.734 --> 01:01:56.067
Okay, so thanks very much.

01:01:56.067 --> 01:01:57.434
If there's people
who have questions,

01:01:57.434 --> 01:01:59.200
we'll stick around
for a little while afterwards.

01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:00.734
Thanks.

01:02:00.734 --> 01:02:03.000
[applause]
