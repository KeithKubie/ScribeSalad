tomorrow morning though the old anecdote
 

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:31.929
tomorrow morning though the old anecdote
or the old advice to sleep on it

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:31.939
or the old advice to sleep on it
 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:34.800
or the old advice to sleep on it
actually has a meaningful impact on

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:34.810
actually has a meaningful impact on
 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.570
actually has a meaningful impact on
dampening our emotions our motion spike

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:37.580
dampening our emotions our motion spike
 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.070
dampening our emotions our motion spike
and that's a signal to us that

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:39.080
and that's a signal to us that
 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.330
and that's a signal to us that
something's wrong or something's

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340
something's wrong or something's
 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.610
something's wrong or something's
important to us we often view sort of

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620
important to us we often view sort of
 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.190
important to us we often view sort of
intensity as a gauge of how important

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:45.200
intensity as a gauge of how important
 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.320
intensity as a gauge of how important
those emotions are to us you know we'll

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:47.330
those emotions are to us you know we'll
 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.000
those emotions are to us you know we'll
do these things in the moment because

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010
do these things in the moment because
 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.850
do these things in the moment because
we're emotional and then we sort of

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:51.860
we're emotional and then we sort of
 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.319
we're emotional and then we sort of
regret it but then we also have to

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:53.329
regret it but then we also have to
 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:55.479
regret it but then we also have to
defend our actions right so we have this

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489
defend our actions right so we have this
 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:58.000
defend our actions right so we have this
this sort of like dueling inside of our

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010
this sort of like dueling inside of our
 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.979
this sort of like dueling inside of our
head where it's like yeah I shouldn't

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989
head where it's like yeah I shouldn't
 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:01.960
head where it's like yeah I shouldn't
have done that but yeah I was really mad

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:01.970
have done that but yeah I was really mad
 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.479
have done that but yeah I was really mad
and I you know I needed to express

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489
and I you know I needed to express
 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:06.639
and I you know I needed to express
myself and so we sort of like justify

00:01:06.639 --> 00:01:06.649
myself and so we sort of like justify
 

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:08.469
myself and so we sort of like justify
our own behavior it's really strange

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479
our own behavior it's really strange
 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:11.260
our own behavior it's really strange
well reduce the impact of those emotions

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270
well reduce the impact of those emotions
 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.080
well reduce the impact of those emotions
so we want to reduce sort of what's

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090
so we want to reduce sort of what's
 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:15.760
so we want to reduce sort of what's
going on in the current moment we want

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770
going on in the current moment we want
 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.500
going on in the current moment we want
to get a better perspective on the

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:17.510
to get a better perspective on the
 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.120
to get a better perspective on the
problem and to get distance from a

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130
problem and to get distance from a
 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.430
problem and to get distance from a
problem it helps to go for a walk it

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:21.440
problem it helps to go for a walk it
 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.350
problem it helps to go for a walk it
helps to take time away from the problem

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360
helps to take time away from the problem
 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.000
helps to take time away from the problem
just sleep on it to look at it in the

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.010
just sleep on it to look at it in the
 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.670
just sleep on it to look at it in the
morning or what I often do is I mentally

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680
morning or what I often do is I mentally
 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.730
morning or what I often do is I mentally
decide here's my decision now I'm gonna

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740
decide here's my decision now I'm gonna
 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.740
decide here's my decision now I'm gonna
sleep on it then I'll wake up in the

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750
sleep on it then I'll wake up in the
 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.060
sleep on it then I'll wake up in the
morning and be like how do I feel about

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070
morning and be like how do I feel about
 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:35.830
morning and be like how do I feel about
that decision because I'll trick myself

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840
that decision because I'll trick myself
 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.899
that decision because I'll trick myself
into having made it and if I have

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909
into having made it and if I have
 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:39.850
into having made it and if I have
regrets that's a sign that I might want

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860
regrets that's a sign that I might want
 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:41.560
regrets that's a sign that I might want
to think about that problem a lot more

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570
to think about that problem a lot more
 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.060
to think about that problem a lot more
and if I'm comfortable with that

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070
and if I'm comfortable with that
 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:44.830
and if I'm comfortable with that
decision then that's a sign that I'm

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840
decision then that's a sign that I'm
 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.750
decision then that's a sign that I'm
probably on the right track if I made

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:46.760
probably on the right track if I made
 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.000
probably on the right track if I made
the same decision when I'm emotionally

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:49.010
the same decision when I'm emotionally
 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.250
the same decision when I'm emotionally
engaged and what I'm not but often you

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:51.260
engaged and what I'm not but often you
 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:52.660
engaged and what I'm not but often you
don't want to decide you just want to

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670
don't want to decide you just want to
 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.880
don't want to decide you just want to
delay that decision why do you have to

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890
delay that decision why do you have to
 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.609
delay that decision why do you have to
make it now another way that we make bad

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619
make it now another way that we make bad
 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:01:59.380
make it now another way that we make bad
decisions or that we trick ourselves

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390
decisions or that we trick ourselves
 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.570
decisions or that we trick ourselves
into making bad decisions is that we

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580
into making bad decisions is that we
 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.749
into making bad decisions is that we
just look for information that confirms

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759
just look for information that confirms
 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:07.660
just look for information that confirms
to what we already believe if people

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670
to what we already believe if people
 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.759
to what we already believe if people
disagree with us how can they be right

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:09.769
disagree with us how can they be right
 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:11.709
disagree with us how can they be right
because that means that we're not right

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:11.719
because that means that we're not right
 

00:02:11.719 --> 00:02:14.679
because that means that we're not right
so our ego doesn't often let this

00:02:14.679 --> 00:02:14.689
so our ego doesn't often let this
 

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:15.550
so our ego doesn't often let this
information

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560
information
 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.339
information
it doesn't process it but what we want

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:18.349
it doesn't process it but what we want
 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:20.500
it doesn't process it but what we want
to do is what Charles Darwin used to do

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510
to do is what Charles Darwin used to do
 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.240
to do is what Charles Darwin used to do
we want to pull out at a journal and

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250
we want to pull out at a journal and
 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.220
we want to pull out at a journal and
every time that something disconfirms of

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230
every time that something disconfirms of
 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.400
every time that something disconfirms of
what we we believe what we know to be

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410
what we we believe what we know to be
 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.470
what we we believe what we know to be
ourselves to be true we want to make a

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480
ourselves to be true we want to make a
 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.140
ourselves to be true we want to make a
note of it and we want to start thinking

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150
note of it and we want to start thinking
 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.790
note of it and we want to start thinking
about it because what we're really

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800
about it because what we're really
 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.280
about it because what we're really
focused on is outcomes we're not focused

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290
focused on is outcomes we're not focused
 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.680
focused on is outcomes we're not focused
on being right or focused on being how

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690
on being right or focused on being how
 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:39.970
on being right or focused on being how
do we create the best outcome possible

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980
do we create the best outcome possible
 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.890
do we create the best outcome possible
and every time that something

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900
and every time that something
 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.900
and every time that something
disconfirms was something that we think

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910
disconfirms was something that we think
 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.420
disconfirms was something that we think
or we believe that's an opportunity to

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430
or we believe that's an opportunity to
 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.130
or we believe that's an opportunity to
learn maybe they're right maybe they're

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140
learn maybe they're right maybe they're
 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.750
learn maybe they're right maybe they're
not but to dismiss it out of hand

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760
not but to dismiss it out of hand
 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.509
not but to dismiss it out of hand
without evaluating it is not doing

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519
without evaluating it is not doing
 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:54.820
without evaluating it is not doing
ourselves justice towards outcomes and

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830
ourselves justice towards outcomes and
 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.340
ourselves justice towards outcomes and
finally overconfidence is one of the

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350
finally overconfidence is one of the
 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:58.660
finally overconfidence is one of the
other ways that we sort of lead

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670
other ways that we sort of lead
 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.699
other ways that we sort of lead
ourselves astray we take out size for

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709
ourselves astray we take out size for
 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:02.470
ourselves astray we take out size for
risk we believe that we have information

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480
risk we believe that we have information
 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.110
risk we believe that we have information
that other people don't have which

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120
that other people don't have which
 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.750
that other people don't have which
causes us to be overconfident to do

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760
causes us to be overconfident to do
 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.080
causes us to be overconfident to do
things that we otherwise wouldn't do

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090
things that we otherwise wouldn't do
 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.339
things that we otherwise wouldn't do
there's a couple of ways to address

00:03:12.339 --> 00:03:12.349
there's a couple of ways to address
 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:14.229
there's a couple of ways to address
being overconfident one is just to

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239
being overconfident one is just to
 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:15.940
being overconfident one is just to
recall all the times you failed and if

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950
recall all the times you failed and if
 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:17.650
recall all the times you failed and if
you haven't failed then that's a problem

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660
you haven't failed then that's a problem
 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.039
you haven't failed then that's a problem
but often we were very confident we if

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:21.049
but often we were very confident we if
 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:23.650
but often we were very confident we if
you calibrate your decisions if I keep a

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660
you calibrate your decisions if I keep a
 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.960
you calibrate your decisions if I keep a
decision journal for example and I write

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970
decision journal for example and I write
 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:27.430
decision journal for example and I write
down here's what I think is gonna happen

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440
down here's what I think is gonna happen
 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.949
down here's what I think is gonna happen
here's why I think it's gonna happen and

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959
here's why I think it's gonna happen and
 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:31.720
here's why I think it's gonna happen and
often we get the outcomes we want but

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730
often we get the outcomes we want but
 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.490
often we get the outcomes we want but
not for the reasons that we thought we

overconfidence because you realize that
how much we don't actually know or how

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030
how much we don't actually know or how
 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.030
how much we don't actually know or how
much we're right and it's not for the

the opportunity for learning and
 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.960
the opportunity for learning and
exploring like why is it you disagree is

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970
exploring like why is it you disagree is
 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:10.240
