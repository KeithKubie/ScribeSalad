00:00:00.352 --> 00:00:02.387
- [Voiceover] What I wanna
do in this video is get

00:00:02.387 --> 00:00:06.387
a little bit familiar with
the idea of molecular mass.

00:00:06.387 --> 00:00:08.797
Let's start off with a molecule that

00:00:08.797 --> 00:00:10.646
we're all quite familiar with.

00:00:10.646 --> 00:00:13.342
In fact, we are made
up of this molecule or

00:00:13.342 --> 00:00:15.275
to a large degree, made
up of this molecule.

00:00:15.275 --> 00:00:17.450
That is water and the molecular

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.689
formula for water is H2O.

00:00:22.321 --> 00:00:24.716
Every water molecule
has two hydrogen atoms

00:00:24.716 --> 00:00:26.401
and one oxygen atom.

00:00:26.401 --> 00:00:28.260
What I'm curious about is, what is

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.738
the mass of a molecule of water?

00:00:32.738 --> 00:00:35.181
So, the way that you might
think about doing that is,

00:00:35.181 --> 00:00:36.865
what's the mass of each of the hydrogens?

00:00:36.865 --> 00:00:37.861
You're gonna have two of those and then

00:00:37.861 --> 00:00:40.266
what's the mass of the oxygen?

00:00:40.266 --> 00:00:42.309
That would be a reasonable way to do it.

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:44.540
So, what is a mass of the hydrogen?

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.360
A hydrogen has a mass...

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.252
We can go to a periodic table here,

00:00:48.252 --> 00:00:49.885
I've got one right over here.

00:00:49.885 --> 00:00:52.533
You see hydrogen, it has
its atomic number one.

00:00:52.533 --> 00:00:56.043
That's the number of protons,
that's what makes it hydrogen.

00:00:56.043 --> 00:00:58.161
Then down here you have this number.

00:00:58.161 --> 00:01:00.040
I think you can see, it's a
little bit small probably,

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.751
on your screen, it says, "1.0079".

00:01:04.751 --> 00:01:09.197
This right over here is the
atomic weight of hydrogen.

00:01:09.197 --> 00:01:12.786
This is, if you take the
various isotopes of hydrogen

00:01:12.786 --> 00:01:16.013
on the planet earth and you
take the weighted average.

00:01:16.013 --> 00:01:19.347
So the ones that are more
common, they are weighted higher.

00:01:19.347 --> 00:01:22.198
The weighted average
of their atomic masses

00:01:22.198 --> 00:01:25.916
is 1.0079.

00:01:25.916 --> 00:01:28.531
Now for the sake of this
first pass, we're just going

00:01:28.531 --> 00:01:32.970
to say, "It's roughly one
atomic mass unit." and one way

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.332
to think about it...

00:01:35.332 --> 00:01:38.038
This isn't precise and it's
not how things are defined,

00:01:38.038 --> 00:01:42.081
but it is a useful way to think about

00:01:42.081 --> 00:01:45.628
atomic mass or mass on the atomic scale.

00:01:45.628 --> 00:01:48.402
Is that one neutron,

00:01:49.233 --> 00:01:52.150
or one proton

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.645
have an atomic mass of approximately

00:01:54.645 --> 00:01:56.583
one atomic mass unit.

00:01:56.583 --> 00:01:58.912
In other videos we'll talk
about why it's not defined

00:01:58.912 --> 00:02:02.088
this way and why it's based on the

00:02:02.088 --> 00:02:03.628
carbon-12 isotope and all of that.

00:02:03.628 --> 00:02:05.637
But this is a fairly useful
thing that is helpful

00:02:05.637 --> 00:02:10.479
to think about, what is the
atomic mass likely to be?

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.057
What is it roughly?

00:02:12.057 --> 00:02:14.569
When you see that hydrogen,
it has one proton.

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:16.207
Clearly, that's what makes it hydrogen.

00:02:16.207 --> 00:02:20.489
It also has an atomic mass of
one or roughly one, it says,

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:24.004
"Well, it must not have a neutron."

00:02:24.004 --> 00:02:26.609
That is the case, the most
common isotope of hydrogen

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:29.546
on earth is just a proton with a electron.

00:02:29.546 --> 00:02:31.639
The electron also does contribute to mass

00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:34.278
but it's negligible
compared to the proton.

00:02:34.278 --> 00:02:37.269
Most of this mass is
essentially the proton.

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:39.453
A little bit of the
electron and also kind of

00:02:39.453 --> 00:02:40.570
the weighted average, when you think about

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:43.144
the other isotopes of
hydrogen that maybe might

00:02:43.144 --> 00:02:46.707
have a neutron that is involved with it.

00:02:46.707 --> 00:02:48.675
For the sake of this, we could say,

00:02:48.675 --> 00:02:52.295
"Hey, hydrogen, it's a
proton with an electron

00:02:52.295 --> 00:02:54.804
"kind of buzzing around it."

00:02:54.804 --> 00:02:57.568
It is approximately one

00:02:57.568 --> 00:02:59.743
atomic mass unit,

00:02:59.743 --> 00:03:01.978
and then oxgen.

00:03:01.978 --> 00:03:05.400
Oxygen, same idea, we'll
look at the periodic table.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.300
You could guess what its mass is close to.

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.524
Oxygen, the most typical isotope of oxygen

00:03:11.524 --> 00:03:14.829
that you'll see on
earth has eight protons.

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:16.811
The eight protons are
what makes it oxygen.

00:03:16.811 --> 00:03:18.842
Any oxygen has to have
eight protons anywhere

00:03:18.842 --> 00:03:20.282
that you are in the
universe, if it doesn't have

00:03:20.282 --> 00:03:23.106
eight protons it's not oxygen.

00:03:23.106 --> 00:03:25.084
It's gonna have eight
protons and it's gonna have

00:03:25.084 --> 00:03:28.489
eight neutrons, that's the
most typical isotope of oxygen.

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:31.196
So you might guess that its atomic mass

00:03:31.196 --> 00:03:34.009
is 16 atomic mass units.

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:36.719
You can see that your
guess is pretty good.

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:39.211
When we look at our atomic
weight right over here.

00:03:39.211 --> 00:03:41.094
Which is the weighted
average of the various

00:03:41.094 --> 00:03:43.267
isotopes of oxygen as found on earth.

00:03:43.267 --> 00:03:47.568
You get 15.999, which
is pretty close to 16.

00:03:47.568 --> 00:03:50.888
Our approximation to 16 is pretty good.

00:03:50.888 --> 00:03:53.191
Then based on these numbers

00:03:53.191 --> 00:03:56.125
you would say that this H2O

00:03:56.125 --> 00:03:59.429
has an atomic mass of approximately...

00:03:59.429 --> 00:04:02.170
Well, two from the hydrogens,
where did I get the two from?

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.154
Each of these two hydrogens

00:04:05.154 --> 00:04:07.768
have an atomic mass of one.

00:04:07.768 --> 00:04:09.602
If you have two times
one, it's just gonna be

00:04:09.602 --> 00:04:11.502
two atomic mass units.

00:04:11.502 --> 00:04:14.474
Then 16 from the oxygen.

00:04:14.474 --> 00:04:17.093
Two plus 16,

00:04:17.093 --> 00:04:19.711
which is going to get us...

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:24.852
Let me do this in another
color, since I've been using...

00:04:24.852 --> 00:04:26.841
It's going to give us 18

00:04:26.841 --> 00:04:29.949
atomic mass units.

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:32.896
Now, if you wanted to be more precise

00:04:32.896 --> 00:04:35.304
or if you wanted to say,
"Well, I have this big bag

00:04:35.304 --> 00:04:39.869
"of water, I'm not looking
exactly at one water molecule.

00:04:39.869 --> 00:04:41.879
"What is going to be, on average,

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:44.014
"the mass of those water molecules?"

00:04:44.014 --> 00:04:46.506
It might be helpful to get
a little it more precise.

00:04:46.506 --> 00:04:48.642
Then it is helpful, especially
if you're talking about a

00:04:48.642 --> 00:04:50.502
large number of molecules
and you really just wanna

00:04:50.502 --> 00:04:52.671
take the weighted average
of all of those molecules.

00:04:52.671 --> 00:04:55.047
Then it makes sense to say, "Well, let's

00:04:55.047 --> 00:04:56.977
"use the atomic weight."

00:04:56.977 --> 00:05:00.000
So for hydrogen, the atomic weight was

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.025
1.0079.

00:05:03.025 --> 00:05:07.213
Which is, once again,
1.0079 atomic mass units.

00:05:07.213 --> 00:05:08.854
We call it atomic weight
but it's really just

00:05:08.854 --> 00:05:10.510
the weighted average, it's not weight in

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:13.093
kind of the physics sense
of measuring a force.

00:05:13.093 --> 00:05:18.093
So, 1.0079 atomic mass
units and the oxygen is

00:05:20.182 --> 00:05:25.169
is 15.999

00:05:25.861 --> 00:05:29.503
atomic mass units and if
you wanted to get a more

00:05:29.503 --> 00:05:33.235
precise number here, let's
get a calculator out.

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:35.763
I got my calculator.

00:05:35.763 --> 00:05:38.320
I'm gonna have two times

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:43.151
1.0079

00:05:43.512 --> 00:05:47.480
is equal to, and then to
that I'm gonna add, plus

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:51.780
15.999.

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:53.476
Gets us to...

00:05:53.476 --> 00:05:57.230
Let's see, I should go no more than

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:00.375
three decimal places to the right.

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.427
Since I added this, if I don't wanna

00:06:03.427 --> 00:06:06.109
add precision here...

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:08.923
If you wanna a review
of that, you should look

00:06:08.923 --> 00:06:10.792
at the video on significant figures.

00:06:10.792 --> 00:06:12.811
Since I added something
with just three decimals to

00:06:12.811 --> 00:06:14.595
to the right I shouldn't
have more than three decimals

00:06:14.595 --> 00:06:17.416
in my answer so, 18.01,

00:06:17.416 --> 00:06:19.245
I'll round in the thousandths place,

00:06:19.245 --> 00:06:21.339
015.

00:06:24.551 --> 00:06:29.551
So the real one is 18.015

00:06:29.561 --> 00:06:31.434
atomic mass units.

00:06:31.434 --> 00:06:33.852
You could actually consider
this the molecular weight.

00:06:33.852 --> 00:06:35.642
Because once again, we're
using atomic weights.

00:06:35.642 --> 00:06:38.075
We're using weighted average
and you could think of,

00:06:38.075 --> 00:06:40.166
maybe the weighted
average of water molecules

00:06:40.166 --> 00:06:42.125
would be a little bit closer to this.

00:06:42.125 --> 00:06:46.151
These two numbers are very close.

00:06:46.151 --> 00:06:47.719
So we might call this

00:06:47.719 --> 00:06:51.685
molecular weight.

00:06:51.685 --> 00:06:54.745
Either way, these ideas
are very closely related.

00:06:54.745 --> 00:06:56.327
When we're thinking on the atomic scale,

00:06:56.327 --> 00:06:58.895
when people use the word
weight, they're not using

00:06:58.895 --> 00:07:00.928
it like a force like
you use in physics that

00:07:00.928 --> 00:07:04.094
you would measure in newtons or pounds.

00:07:04.094 --> 00:07:06.528
They are essentially taking a

00:07:06.528 --> 00:07:09.856
weighted average of masses.

00:07:09.856 --> 00:07:14.012
So the molecular weight of
water, 18.015 atomic mass units.

00:07:14.012 --> 00:07:16.275
If you wanted to just kinda
be a little bit loosey goosey,

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:20.225
you could say it's roughly
18 atomic mass units.
