we were discussing the the last parts of
 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.020
we were discussing the the last parts of
the data and and those phases so if I

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030
the data and and those phases so if I
 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.069
the data and and those phases so if I
think too many exciting things to deal

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079
think too many exciting things to deal
 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:01:02.139
think too many exciting things to deal
with it at the same time I suppose

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:02.149
 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:05.630
plane so he doesn't know I'm so

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640
plane so he doesn't know I'm so
 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.760
plane so he doesn't know I'm so
frustrated because he can't get in touch

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770
frustrated because he can't get in touch
 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.649
frustrated because he can't get in touch
with him that's deeply frustrating yes

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659
with him that's deeply frustrating yes
 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.219
with him that's deeply frustrating yes
when and where does he land so he will

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229
when and where does he land so he will
 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.760
when and where does he land so he will
land in Munich and I think he said

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770
land in Munich and I think he said
 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.330
land in Munich and I think he said
around right so so there'll be a posse

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340
around right so so there'll be a posse
 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:27.490
around right so so there'll be a posse
of people waiting for him I imagine

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500
 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.330
waiting out there

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340
 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.730
so I mean you are a married couple and

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740
so I mean you are a married couple and
 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.319
so I mean you are a married couple and
it's very unusual for married couples to

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329
it's very unusual for married couples to
 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.760
it's very unusual for married couples to
receive the Nobel Prize one thinks of

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770
receive the Nobel Prize one thinks of
 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.350
receive the Nobel Prize one thinks of
the quarries and the Curie's but what's

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360
the quarries and the Curie's but what's
 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.010
the quarries and the Curie's but what's
the secret of your partnership I think

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020
the secret of your partnership I think
 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.370
the secret of your partnership I think
it's the secret ask after about the

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380
it's the secret ask after about the
 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.810
it's the secret ask after about the
secret of why we could come so far

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820
secret of why we could come so far
 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.429
secret of why we could come so far
together okay in in science and I think

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439
together okay in in science and I think
 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.469
together okay in in science and I think
that is that we have the same vision we

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479
that is that we have the same vision we
 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:09.999
that is that we have the same vision we
love to understand and we do that by

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009
love to understand and we do that by
 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.410
love to understand and we do that by
talking to each other talking to other

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420
talking to each other talking to other
 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.210
talking to each other talking to other
people and

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220
people and
 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.030
people and
try to address the questions that we

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040
try to address the questions that we
 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.000
try to address the questions that we
interested in in in the best way that we

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010
interested in in in the best way that we
 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.360
interested in in in the best way that we
can think of so and and and to be able

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370
can think of so and and and to be able
 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.949
can think of so and and and to be able
to to discuss this when you get an idea

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959
to to discuss this when you get an idea
 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.309
to to discuss this when you get an idea
on the spot instead of plan a meeting in

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319
on the spot instead of plan a meeting in
 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:34.190
on the spot instead of plan a meeting in
one or two or three weeks that makes a

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200
one or two or three weeks that makes a
 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.289
one or two or three weeks that makes a
huge difference so there's a lot of

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:36.299
huge difference so there's a lot of
 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:39.800
huge difference so there's a lot of
spontaneity about it yeah and and it's

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810
spontaneity about it yeah and and it's
 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.599
spontaneity about it yeah and and it's
it's so funny because you know we have

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:41.609
it's so funny because you know we have
 

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:44.119
it's so funny because you know we have
the caffeine which is there and we had

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:44.129
the caffeine which is there and we had
 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:46.690

this meeting with recovery directors and
 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.369
this meeting with recovery directors and
they said yeah and then we have to plan

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:49.379
they said yeah and then we have to plan
 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:51.619

that this is honor for all the people
 

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:49.009
that this is honor for all the people
who have supported excellent science in

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019
who have supported excellent science in
 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:49.670

have been extremely extremely supportive

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:05.669
