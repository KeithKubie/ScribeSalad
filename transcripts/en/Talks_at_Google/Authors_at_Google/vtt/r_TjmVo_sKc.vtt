00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:45.269
We'll have time for Q and A at the mikes at
the end.

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:47.479
Please join me in welcoming Rich to Google.

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:51.679
[Applause]
&gt;&gt;Rich: Thanks Joy, I appreciate it.

00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:52.679
Thanks.

00:00:52.679 --> 00:00:57.899
So this past Saturday morning I'm sitting
in my home office it's about seven o'clock

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.430
and I'm listening to a CD that I'd recorded
a few days earlier on strategy.

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.460
I was just checking to see if I needed to
make any changes.

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.829
At about 7:30 my eight-year-old son, named
Luke, came into the room and he plops down

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:12.850
on the big brown leather chair.

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.939
And I watch him listen for about a minute
or so and finally, being the dad, I had to

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.200
ask, "So Luke,what you think of dad's new
CD on strategy?"

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.399
I'm excited right?

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:25.009
And he goes, "It sounds like church."

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:28.689
[Laughter]
And so not putting that together right away

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:30.460
I say, "Well church, how is it like church?"

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.880
He said, "Well, there's a lot of talking,
I don't understand most of it and I think

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:34.880
I'm getting sleepy."

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.250
[Laughter]
And in fairness to Luke, I think discussions

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.060
sometimes of strategy can be that way.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.210
But not usually when we apply strategy to
you, which is what we're going to do today.

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:53.600
You know there's a simple but often overlooked
premise in life, and that is new growth comes

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.890
from new thinking.

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.479
New growth comes from new thinking.

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:04.609
Expecting new growth for your career, for
your business, for your relationships, for

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:10.929
your finances without new ways of thinking
about them is like a farmer expecting new

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.780
crops to grow without first planting the seeds.

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:21.080
And that's really the goal of this session
this afternoon is to give you some new concepts,

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:28.620
some new tools to think strategically about
your life, your work, your relationships,

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:29.720
your career.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:30.820
Okay?

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.890
And so as we do that, we're gonna talk a little
bit about strategy overall and obviously being

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.730
here at Google you understand strategy better
than most.

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.790
But we're gonna talk not just about business
strategy but how do you take some of those

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:48.450
key principles of strategy, principles that
have been around thousands of years and actually

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:55.510
use them to be happier, more successful however
you define success in your life.

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:02.720
And when we think about strategy, really what
we're thinking about is here is where we are

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.549
today; here's where we want to go.

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:13.819
Strategy is the bridge that takes us from
where we are to where we want to go.

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:18.329
So from a business standpoint, many of you
have goals and objectives for your plans for

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:19.349
the year.

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:24.690
The strategy, as you know, is how you get
from where you are today to reach those goals

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.069
and objectives.

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:32.549
From a personal perspective strategy is looking
at where are you right now your life?

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:37.010
Mind, body, relationships, finances, spirituality.

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.860
And where do you really want to be with those
different areas?

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:49.130
You know a lot of times we bounce around from
one thing to the next like a pinball, with

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:50.910
no real direction.

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:56.470
And strategy, or that bridge can kind of give
us that direction.

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:02.209
It can help channel what we're good at, what
we like to do, who we like to help from a

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:08.510
profit or nonprofit perspective and we can
find ways to do that effectively and in ways

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.290
that other people value.

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:15.300
You know great strategy is not just from a
business standpoint or a political standpoint

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:23.240
or a military standpoint, it's designed to
help us take back that power in our lives.

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:28.830
I don't know about you but often times I feel
a little bit like I don't have control.

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:32.000
Things are going in a lot of different directions,
I'm bouncing around.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.960
Strategy is a way to take some of that control
back.

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.080
To take some of that direction back.

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:44.330
So in 15 years, 20 years, 25 years, we can
look back and say you know what I did the

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.480
most with what I have.

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:51.110
The biggest thing we don't want to do, and
when you interview folks that are in their

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:56.500
70s and 80s and 90s the biggest thing is folks
looking back with regret to say I could have

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.880
maybe done this for work or I could have maybe
been in this relationship or I could've maybe

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:05.240
volunteered more often, but I didn't do it.

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.540
So we want to do today is talk a little bit
about how do we do that?

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:13.060
How do we make sure we realize our full potential?

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:19.500
And really as we talk today, we're gonna be
talking about how do you make those decisions?

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.790
Just out of curiosity how many folks here,
show of hands, how many of you have a written

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:26.090
business plan for the group that you work
with?

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:29.810
Just a show of hands, any of you guys ever
written a business plan for what you do?

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:34.090
Okay, maybe about half, a third.

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:40.060
How about personally, how many folks have
a written plan, doesn't have to be a 20 page

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.680
plan because we know those never get used.

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:47.830
But how many folks have written down some
of their goals professionally, personally

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:50.170
and then how you're going to get there?

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:56.430
Okay, so good maybe about 25-30% that's actually
more than we normally see.

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:00.590
Because what the research shows, and I, in
the last couple years did research with about

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:02.990
2500 adults in the United States.

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:09.380
And what we found is that about 15% of adults
have a written plan for their lives.

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:14.290
So career, relationships, finances, spirituality
about 15%.

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:19.780
What was interesting is that we also did a
separate study looking at folks that worked

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:21.930
for Fortune 1000 companies.

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:26.220
So folks that were managers in Fortune 1000
companies and what we found was that only

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:30.610
22% of those folks had a written plan for
their life.

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:36.120
The interesting thing is when you look at
strategy for business we know that historically

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:41.100
and from a research perspective strategy is
very important to successful businesses.

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:45.850
There is just recently completed a 25 year
study on 750 bankrupt companies.

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:51.680
And what they found was that the number one
cause of bankruptcy over the last 25 years

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.600
was bad strategy.

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:59.390
So companies not having either establishes
strategy or working with a flawed strategy,

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:01.240
that was the number one cause of bankruptcy.

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:06.600
And today you open up the paper, you see companies
like United Airlines, Borders, companies that

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:10.920
we're very familiar with, bigger companies
sometimes going bankrupt.

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:15.080
So we do know in business, from a business
perspective, strategy's important.

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:20.700
From an individual perspective, as managers
potentially, strategy is also important.

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:24.780
There were two separate studies on leadership
published in the Wall Street Journal and Chief

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:29.890
Executive Magazine and both of those studies
on leadership found that the number one most

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:35.050
valued skill in leaders today is strategic
thinking.

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:39.920
But interestingly 50% of companies reported
that strategic thinking is the skill their

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:42.620
leaders most needed to improve.

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:48.210
And in the research for my previous book "Deep
Dive" what I found is that only about three

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:53.450
out of every 10 managers are strategic, so
about 30%.

00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:56.930
So what we want to do today is say how can
we raise that level?

00:07:56.930 --> 00:08:01.400
How can we take what we do day in and day
out and give it a little bit of direction?

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:02.400
Right?

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:05.460
None of us want to be pigeon-holed and say
in three years you're going to do this, in

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:08.830
five years you're gonna do this, in seven
years you're gonna do this, right?

00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:09.830
We don't want that.

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:14.700
But what we do want is to take what we're
good at, what we're passionate about and channel

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:18.130
that so that we're using that as we move through.

00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:22.560
What that looks like in three or four years
you might not know but we at least want to

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:27.620
have that mapped out so that we're making
progress and we're realizing our potential,

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:29.420
whatever that might be.

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:34.810
So as I did the research for this last book,
what we found is that there's roughly 5 steps

00:08:34.810 --> 00:08:37.719
to developing a strategy for your life.

00:08:37.719 --> 00:08:41.329
These also tend to coincide with business,
business strategies as well.

00:08:41.329 --> 00:08:46.500
But for this, instance really five steps in
creating that strategy for life.

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:57.019
And so the five steps are number one discover,
secondly differentiate, third decide, fourth

00:08:57.019 --> 00:09:00.759
design, and then fifth drive.

00:09:00.759 --> 00:09:04.500
So what we're gonna do in the next half hour
or so is just kind of walk through each of

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:09.600
these areas and then I would certainly like
to open it up to any questions, comments,

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:13.779
observations that you might have from your
life and maybe some the things that you found

00:09:13.779 --> 00:09:18.319
successful in driving or developing strategies
for yourselves.

00:09:18.319 --> 00:09:20.269
So the first step is discover.

00:09:20.269 --> 00:09:25.680
And discover means we've got to first understand
where are we today?

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:29.560
We've got to stop and say where are we today?

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:33.550
We've got to get an idea of what does our
situation look like.

00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:36.670
And it's important for several reasons and
first we'll talk a little bit about Katie

00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:37.800
Couric.

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:42.930
Maybe not the most flattering shot of Katie,
but we know Katie Couric for years and years,

00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:46.100
very successful cohost of The Today Show with
Matt Lauer.

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:48.360
Year after year ranked number one.

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:55.079
About five years ago she went to the CBS evening
news and you can't blame her, 13-14 million

00:09:55.079 --> 00:09:57.459
a year so that's incentive.

00:09:57.459 --> 00:10:02.500
And each year though she was ranked dead last
in viewership.

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:03.810
Year after year.

00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:08.360
Even about 500,000 viewers behind the anchor
who was in the seat from CBS that nobody knew

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:10.420
before her.

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:14.110
So we wonder, well, what happened to Katie
in that five-year time frame?

00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:16.810
Did she just become a mumbling bumbling broadcaster?

00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:19.290
And the answer is no.

00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:21.910
What happened though is her situation changed.

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:23.850
Her context changed.

00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:28.850
Who she was talking to, what she was talking
about, the time of day she was talking about,

00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:30.950
all those things changed.

00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:36.470
And because her situation changed it negatively
impacted her performance.

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:39.149
Or at least her perceived performance.

00:10:39.149 --> 00:10:43.689
So one of the things we want to do is find
a way to understand what's going on in our

00:10:43.689 --> 00:10:44.689
life.

00:10:44.689 --> 00:10:45.689
Okay?

00:10:45.689 --> 00:10:46.689
What's going on in our life.

00:10:46.689 --> 00:10:51.470
And when you build a bridge one of the first
things that happens in addition to the surveying

00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:55.310
things is you create a survey of the site
right?

00:10:55.310 --> 00:11:00.259
Understand what's the composition of the ground
like, what's the distance we've gotta span,

00:11:00.259 --> 00:11:04.190
where we going to take this bridge, what types
of materials might be appropriate?

00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:08.110
So we create that survey or snapshot of what's
happening.

00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:12.379
So we can do that for ourselves as well, and
most of the things we talk about today we're

00:11:12.379 --> 00:11:17.199
gonna do visually because I think visually
[snap] tends to connect a little bit quicker.

00:11:17.199 --> 00:11:22.589
So when we look at a survey of ourselves we
can potentially break it down into four areas.

00:11:22.589 --> 00:11:28.209
And there's other areas we can consider, but
four we can consider for today are mind, body,

00:11:28.209 --> 00:11:29.300
relationships and finances.

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:32.680
Mind, body, relationships, finances.

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:37.950
So when it comes to mind, things that we're
thinking about relative to potentially our

00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:40.720
career, our work, our spirituality.

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:44.620
The things that tend to be top of mind day
in and day out.

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:46.839
From a body perspective, what's our health
like?

00:11:46.839 --> 00:11:48.220
Are we in good shape?

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:50.470
Do we think we need to be in better shape?

00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:54.019
Do we have a history of medical illnesses
that we need to be aware of?

00:11:54.019 --> 00:11:57.730
What, from a physical body perspective, are
some of the key things that we need to think

00:11:57.730 --> 00:11:58.820
about?

00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:04.370
Relationships, family, friends, coworkers
where are we at with those?

00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:05.970
Are they strong across the board?

00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:11.070
Are we not spending as much time with kids
or with friends that we're close to because

00:12:11.070 --> 00:12:12.970
works dominating?

00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:14.529
So where are the relationships at?

00:12:14.529 --> 00:12:15.670
And then finances.

00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:21.139
And again as we move forward, if you have
families where are we financially?

00:12:21.139 --> 00:12:22.480
Where do we want to be?

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:24.459
Do we have a plan for getting there?

00:12:24.459 --> 00:12:29.550
So what we can do then is populate this tool
with kind of what's top of mind for us in

00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:30.889
each of those areas.

00:12:30.889 --> 00:12:34.560
So if we start with body, maybe we say you
know the few times that we have exercised

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:37.120
in the morning, it's really jump started our
day.

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:40.379
So that might be a key as far as getting our
plan set.

00:12:40.379 --> 00:12:45.839
We know that when we're around the house diet's
pretty good but generally if we're traveling

00:12:45.839 --> 00:12:47.399
we kind of fall off the wagon.

00:12:47.399 --> 00:12:50.980
We're eating, drinking stuff that we shouldn't
be.

00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:55.100
Relationship wise maybe we say you know I'm
not spending as much time with my friends

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:56.190
as I used to.

00:12:56.190 --> 00:12:59.279
We've got maybe more family commitments, kids,
things like that.

00:12:59.279 --> 00:13:03.069
But those relationships are still important,
how do we make sure they don't wither and

00:13:03.069 --> 00:13:04.529
die?

00:13:04.529 --> 00:13:09.370
We also might think about coworkers, you know
maybe we've got a new coworker; it's maybe

00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:11.129
not going great right away.

00:13:11.129 --> 00:13:15.009
How do we build that relationship so that
it becomes a stronger, more vital one to our

00:13:15.009 --> 00:13:16.009
group?

00:13:16.009 --> 00:13:19.290
Financially, what are we doing long-term?

00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:22.279
What are we doing from a partner or spouse
perspective?

00:13:22.279 --> 00:13:26.410
They want to go to Europe, how do we get that
set up so that happens?

00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:29.639
And then from a mind perspective, we're thinking
about work.

00:13:29.639 --> 00:13:32.589
What do we need to do to differentiate ourselves?

00:13:32.589 --> 00:13:36.120
To move up in the organization, maybe get
more responsibility?

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:39.740
And then also are we looking for opportunities
to volunteer?

00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:44.619
So again these are just some generic examples
but really what we want to do with this tool

00:13:44.619 --> 00:13:50.779
is give ourselves a way to take a snapshot
of what's happening in our lives.

00:13:50.779 --> 00:13:56.089
You've got it all kind of fluttering around
in your mind but if you don't put it on paper

00:13:56.089 --> 00:14:02.910
it generally doesn't tend to provide that
foundation for the plan that we'll talk about

00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:04.410
a few minutes.

00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:09.620
So once you've taken a snapshot of what's
going on around you what we can then do is

00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:11.940
start to think about where do we want to go?

00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:15.309
And as we know most of the time we're setting
our goals.

00:14:15.309 --> 00:14:20.329
And I developed a simple framework, I use
this with business managers primarily but

00:14:20.329 --> 00:14:22.639
you can also apply it to your life.

00:14:22.639 --> 00:14:28.790
Goals and objective, that part of GOST, goals
and objectives are what you're trying to achieve.

00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:31.319
Strategy and tactics, how you are going to
get there.

00:14:31.319 --> 00:14:34.699
And you say well sure Rich, everybody knows
that.

00:14:34.699 --> 00:14:35.699
Not necessarily.

00:14:35.699 --> 00:14:42.129
A couple years ago, one of the CEOs of a prominent
company out this way and I won't say the name

00:14:42.129 --> 00:14:47.769
came out when she first started and said,
"The primary strategy for our company is to

00:14:47.769 --> 00:14:51.660
grow our audience", which is terrific.

00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:54.930
But that's not a strategy, that's the goal.

00:14:54.930 --> 00:14:57.709
How you grow the audience is the strategy.

00:14:57.709 --> 00:15:02.339
So as you think about this in relation to
yourself, your goals, what do you want to

00:15:02.339 --> 00:15:04.370
achieve?

00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:09.319
Whether it's work, whether it's your health,
whether it's relationships what specifically

00:15:09.319 --> 00:15:10.319
do you want to achieve?

00:15:10.319 --> 00:15:12.509
You've got to start with a goal then the objective.

00:15:12.509 --> 00:15:18.519
We've heard smart, specific, measurable, achievable,
relevant, time-bound, so what specifically?

00:15:18.519 --> 00:15:22.540
Strategy and tactics then is that bridge,
how you're going to get there.

00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:25.140
Okay so let's look at couple examples.

00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:29.649
Business wise we might have one that says
our goal is to win a quarterly sales contest

00:15:29.649 --> 00:15:31.129
for our region.

00:15:31.129 --> 00:15:37.279
The objective then more specifically what
we want to achieve, 200,000, 250,000 in sales

00:15:37.279 --> 00:15:39.339
by the end of the third quarter.

00:15:39.339 --> 00:15:42.999
Strategy, then, how generally are we going
to get there?

00:15:42.999 --> 00:15:47.069
Focus our selling efforts on expanding share
of wallet with current customers.

00:15:47.069 --> 00:15:51.330
And then tactically we might do a cell sheet,
video of customers using the products and

00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:52.740
so forth.

00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:55.050
How do we apply that then into our personal
lives?

00:15:55.050 --> 00:15:57.839
The goal might be to lose weight.

00:15:57.839 --> 00:16:01.439
We're just getting through the winter, I'm
from Chicago, we tend to eat a lot of stuffed

00:16:01.439 --> 00:16:02.660
pizza in the winter.

00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:04.560
So the goal might be to lose some weight.

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:09.699
The objective more specifically is lose 15
pounds in six months.

00:16:09.699 --> 00:16:16.350
The strategy then, how generally are we going
to do it is to eliminate weight causing behaviors

00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:17.990
and create healthy habits.

00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:23.129
So tactically, specifically, we might do things
like try to drink more water as opposed to

00:16:23.129 --> 00:16:24.769
those two or three sodas a day.

00:16:24.769 --> 00:16:29.339
Get a treadmill, get some strength bands,
eat protein-based breakfasts, do some of those

00:16:29.339 --> 00:16:30.529
things.

00:16:30.529 --> 00:16:35.449
So again, many of you it sounded like are
doing this already but we've got to be able

00:16:35.449 --> 00:16:40.429
to jot down the goal of what we're trying
to achieve the objective the strategy and

00:16:40.429 --> 00:16:42.499
the tactic, OK?

00:16:42.499 --> 00:16:47.850
So again we don't have a lot of time today
but one of the exercises I'd recommend is

00:16:47.850 --> 00:16:53.679
take a few minutes, think about your work,
think about your relationships, think about

00:16:53.679 --> 00:16:56.639
your finances, what are some of the goals?

00:16:56.639 --> 00:17:04.600
And what are the strategies you going to use
to get there, OK?

00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:12.470
About 1974 or I think it was roughly August
7th, a Frenchman by the name of Phillippe

00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:19.310
Petit did something that no one had done before
and no one has done since.

00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:25.170
He set up a wire, a 450 pound cable between
the twin towers of the World Trade Center

00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:34.910
and for about an hour he walked on that high
wire 1350 feet above the streets of Manhattan.

00:17:34.910 --> 00:17:43.200
Jumping, dancing, laying down, no harness,
no safety wire, nothing for about an hour.

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:48.200
And then finally was pulled off by the police
as it started to rain.

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:53.030
So we look at that and we say very interesting,
it was actually called the artistic crime

00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:54.030
of the century.

00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:59.790
And there's a great documentary called 'Man
on Wire' and it won the 2008 Academy Award

00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:03.660
for best documentary if you haven't been seen
it it's fairly interesting.

00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:06.390
And it documents what he did.

00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:11.120
And some say, well you know it was just kind
of a spur of the moment, a whim, a lark and

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:17.460
actually that moment had been preceded by
six years of him planning with a group of

00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:22.510
about 10 people in order to be able to set
this up and do it.

00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:30.230
So at the end of the day, he took what's obviously
a very common activity which is walking and

00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:35.430
he did it in a way that the people who've
seen it or seen the documentary will never

00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:36.930
forget.

00:18:36.930 --> 00:18:42.810
So he took a common activity and he made it
his own through his unique talent and his

00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:44.450
unique passion.

00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:49.780
And any time you develop strategy for your
career, for your business inherently there's

00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:52.690
going to be risk.

00:18:52.690 --> 00:18:59.520
If you're comfortable every day and everything
that you do you're probably not really maximizing

00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:01.460
your potential.

00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:04.250
Great strategy demands that you take risks.

00:19:04.250 --> 00:19:09.590
Reed Hastings who, as many of you know I'm
sure, is the CEO of Netflix has said, "If

00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:16.320
you don't feel pain when you're developing
strategy then you have not developed strategy."

00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:20.080
So one of the things that I'd like you to
think about in the next few minutes is what

00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:29.370
are some of the unique talents, the activities,
the passions that you have that others don't?

00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:36.860
And how have you, in the past, used those
to bring value to yourself and to other people

00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:39.640
around you.

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:42.800
So the second step in our process is differentiate.

00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:49.380
You know when you look at most great companies
you can very quickly understand how they differentiate

00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:53.700
themselves from the other companies they compete
with in order to be successful.

00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:58.460
You know a company like yours obviously you've
driven a lot of your differentiation around

00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:04.800
this idea of play from a culture perspective
because play leads to innovation which leads

00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:07.450
to new value for customers.

00:20:07.450 --> 00:20:10.110
So what I want you to think about is how do
we differentiate.

00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:12.190
And I'll give you a couple more examples.

00:20:12.190 --> 00:20:15.260
There's a British artist name Damien Hirst.

00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:23.240
And Damien Hirst has become a very popular,
maybe infamous in some circles, artist because

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:28.170
what he's done is he's taken art and he's
done it very differently than most anyone

00:20:28.170 --> 00:20:29.360
else out there in the world.

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:35.420
What he started to do, or what he's been doing
is taking animals, dead animals, okay, I'm

00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:38.600
not a part of PETA, and if you are please
direct comments to Damien.

00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:44.380
But he's been taking dead animals and putting
them in formaldehyde and using them in different

00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:49.740
ways, different positions, different forms
to create artwork.

00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:52.750
This is one of his most famous pieces.

00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:56.290
Now we can argue all day is that art or is
it not art?

00:20:56.290 --> 00:21:01.900
And I'm not gonna say which side I fall on,
but the reality is, by doing art in a different

00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:12.580
way, a way that's meaningful to him, he's
become the most wealthy British living artist.

00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:15.190
His net worth is about $350 million.

00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:20.050
So again were not saying that's the be-all
end-all of art, but the reality is he's one

00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:24.820
example of an artist whose done things differently
to be successful.

00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:28.650
You look at an entertainer like Johnny Cash.

00:21:28.650 --> 00:21:31.750
We know Johnny Cash, American singer-songwriter.

00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:38.650
When you listen to his recordings never the
best voice really, but what made him successful,

00:21:38.650 --> 00:21:45.800
what made him endeared to many people is his
ability to tell a true authentic story in

00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:49.360
a way that resonated with people.

00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:54.410
Another example of doing things differently,
I'm from Chicago and there's a restaurant

00:21:54.410 --> 00:22:02.200
in Chicago called Alinea, and the chef there
is a person by the name of Grant Achatz.

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:09.410
Grant Achatz, in 2008, was named the number
one chef in the United States and last year

00:22:09.410 --> 00:22:14.460
his restaurant, Alinea, was named the number
one restaurant in North America by restaurant

00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:15.460
magazine.

00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:22.010
So you say, wow a very successful person,
he's also overcome cancer in this whole process

00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:25.510
which has been a testament to his character.

00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:27.240
So how do you top that?

00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:32.070
So what he decided to do was a completely
different concept when it comes to restaurants

00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:34.420
for his next restaurant.

00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:37.160
His new restaurant is called Next.

00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:41.090
And Next, what they do is they have four menus
for the year.

00:22:41.090 --> 00:22:46.180
Each of the menu's represents a different
time and a different place in history.

00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:54.740
So Paris 1906 or Sicily 1949 or Hong Kong
2036.

00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:58.120
And for three months, that's the menu.

00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:01.120
You don't make a reservation, you have to
buy tickets.

00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:05.900
Ticket prices differ based on the week of
the day and the time of the day.

00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:10.920
So if you want tickets for Wednesday night
at nine o'clock, they're gonna be less expensive

00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:13.640
than Saturday night at seven o'clock.

00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:16.510
All of the cost is included within that ticket.

00:23:16.510 --> 00:23:21.350
So when you go, you're not tipping anyone,
you're not paying extra for drinks, everything's

00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:22.350
included.

00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:27.940
You can also get a subscription so that you
can have tickets for each of the four.

00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:33.010
So again we think about dining, restaurants,
very similar activities but Grant has done

00:23:33.010 --> 00:23:38.270
it in a different way that's helped him stand
out amongst his peers.

00:23:38.270 --> 00:23:43.910
So I'd like you to think about and if you
have a pen and paper maybe jot down, but think

00:23:43.910 --> 00:23:52.241
about what are some of the unique traits,
activities, skills that you have that you

00:23:52.241 --> 00:23:58.230
are able to bring value to yourself or other
people in your life?

00:23:58.230 --> 00:23:59.780
What makes you unique?

00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:03.110
Your talent, your passion, okay?

00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:08.130
So think about that as you move forward.

00:24:08.130 --> 00:24:09.680
Several years ago my wife.

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:11.460
Anne, and I went on a safari in Africa.

00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:15.390
And we took a tour of a Masai Mara tribal
village led by a native guide.

00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:20.530
And he said "The tribal leader in this village
has seven wives because the women in the village

00:24:20.530 --> 00:24:22.230
do most of the work.

00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:27.460
From washing the clothes in the stream to
building the huts that you see out of sticks

00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:29.640
and cow dung."

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:33.510
So if you've been to Africa, some of the places,
the huts, the houses they live in are actually

00:24:33.510 --> 00:24:35.890
made of dried cow dung which is interesting.

00:24:35.890 --> 00:24:40.380
Anyway, were finishing up the tour and the
tribal leader, the one with seven wives emerges

00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:43.410
from his hut and begins talking with some
of the tourists.

00:24:43.410 --> 00:24:48.500
As we're about to leave, I notice the tribal
leader talking to my wife, Anne.

00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:52.990
So being the interested husband I kind of
wandered over to eavesdrop on the end of the

00:24:52.990 --> 00:24:53.990
conversation.

00:24:53.990 --> 00:25:00.310
He said to her, "We have much work to do here
but our lives are simple and good.

00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:04.740
I am always looking for the right people to
carry on our traditions.

00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:10.620
I find you to be attractive and sturdy; would
you like to be one of my wives?"

00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:14.860
Now in fairness to my wife, Anne, I think
being called sturdy in Africa is a complement

00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:17.640
to women I'm not so sure it would be here.

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:21.700
[Laughter]
So after a long pause by Anne, a little too

00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:23.000
long for my liking,
[Laughter]

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:28.640
she said, "You know, I love the land here,
and the animals are beautiful but seeing as

00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:31.170
how I'm already married all respectfully have
to pass."

00:25:31.170 --> 00:25:35.430
So on the bouncy Jeep ride back to camp I
couldn't let that conversation go without

00:25:35.430 --> 00:25:37.400
just a little jab.

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:41.740
So I said, "You know, honey, it sounds like
your decision earlier boiled down to me or

00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:42.950
a house of cow dung."

00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:45.660
And she said, "Yes and it was much closer
than you think."

00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:49.310
[Laughter]
Because the reality is in business and our

00:25:49.310 --> 00:25:54.630
personal lives we're constantly faced with
trade-offs.

00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:57.490
Trade-offs involve incompatible activities.

00:25:57.490 --> 00:26:00.510
More of one thing means less of another.

00:26:00.510 --> 00:26:04.790
And inherently, when we make trade-offs we're
making decisions.

00:26:04.790 --> 00:26:08.220
So step three of our process is decide.

00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:13.370
And the word decide or decision comes from
the Latin word decidere which means to cut

00:26:13.370 --> 00:26:14.620
off.

00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:18.980
If you have trees on your property you know
that every few years you've got to cut off,

00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:27.080
you've gotta prune some of the low branches,
some of the dead branches to promote new growth.

00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:29.440
Think about your work.

00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:31.590
Think about your personal life.

00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:39.960
We're very good about adding things to our
plate, but how often do we stop and actively,

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:43.300
consciously take things off of our plate?

00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:46.990
Especially from a work standpoint I see it
very often.

00:26:46.990 --> 00:26:50.630
You're adding more projects, you're adding
more work because you want to be that team

00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:56.380
player and all the sudden your spread too
thin and you're not as valuable to your team

00:26:56.380 --> 00:27:01.440
or the business unit as you could be because
there is no focus.

00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:04.720
The same thing happens with our lives.

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:10.930
We mean well, we want to volunteer on a number
of different nonprofit opportunities.

00:27:10.930 --> 00:27:13.450
We want to make sure we get to our kids' events.

00:27:13.450 --> 00:27:18.100
We want to stay late and make sure we get
that project done.

00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:23.120
But suddenly sometimes we feel like we've
spread ourselves too thin.

00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:28.590
So we want to understand how can we focus
a little bit more on what's really valuable

00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:33.950
to us and the people that we care about at
work and at home?

00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:38.930
And one of the ways to do that is to come
up with a not to do list.

00:27:38.930 --> 00:27:41.330
And this isn't a revolutionary concept.

00:27:41.330 --> 00:27:48.840
But what I have found is I do leadership programs
on strategic thinking with managers around

00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:50.190
the world.

00:27:50.190 --> 00:27:55.480
What I've found is that the great managers
or leaders are the ones that are crystal clear

00:27:55.480 --> 00:28:00.350
on what they and their teams are not going
to do.

00:28:00.350 --> 00:28:06.090
Everybody has a to do list but the great leaders
are the ones that are crystal clear on what

00:28:06.090 --> 00:28:09.530
they're not going to do.

00:28:09.530 --> 00:28:12.280
So that comes to our personal lives as well.

00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:16.480
We have to make those trade-offs otherwise
they get made for you.

00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:17.480
Right?

00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:21.450
And that's when we feel like we don't really
have control of what's going on, we feel like

00:28:21.450 --> 00:28:23.240
we're spread too thin.

00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:27.210
So one of the things you may consider doing
is a not to do list.

00:28:27.210 --> 00:28:31.780
Look at those areas that we talked about,
look at work, what are some of the activities,

00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:36.490
the projects, the reports, the tactics that
you think you should stop doing?

00:28:36.490 --> 00:28:39.070
Because they're no longer bringing value.

00:28:39.070 --> 00:28:43.810
Think about your personal life, from a financial
perspective what are areas that you're spending

00:28:43.810 --> 00:28:49.490
money that aren't really adding value long-term
to you or the people that you care about?

00:28:49.490 --> 00:28:54.860
So think about that not to do list that's
potentially a way to creating greater focus

00:28:54.860 --> 00:29:01.250
not only at work but in your personal lives
as well.

00:29:01.250 --> 00:29:06.640
When you create a house, when you create a
building, when you create a bridge generally

00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:09.100
you start with a blueprint, right?

00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:14.110
If you are gonna have a new house built and
you talk to the architect and they just showed

00:29:14.110 --> 00:29:18.580
up on the job site and had people start digging
and you said, "Well, where's the blueprints?"

00:29:18.580 --> 00:29:23.210
And he said, or she said, "We don't have a
blueprint", you'd think, “oh my God what

00:29:23.210 --> 00:29:25.130
do you mean we don't have a blueprint?

00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:28.850
How do we know what were actually going to
do because we don't have a blueprint?”

00:29:28.850 --> 00:29:35.680
Yet in business and in our personal lives
a good number of folks operate without that

00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:37.080
blueprint.

00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:40.730
And so design is that fourth step.

00:29:40.730 --> 00:29:46.090
Once you've kind of discovered where you are
step one, you've differentiated in step two

00:29:46.090 --> 00:29:51.460
and thought about what are you're unique talents
and passions and how do you bring those together.

00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:56.960
And in step three you've decided where am
I going to focus my time, my talent, and any

00:29:56.960 --> 00:30:00.330
finances to be happy, to be successful?

00:30:00.330 --> 00:30:02.540
Now we get to design.

00:30:02.540 --> 00:30:04.930
Design means we need to layout that plan.

00:30:04.930 --> 00:30:10.320
And planning in a lot of places has negative
baggage with it.

00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:14.830
Well we develop a plan but it sits in a binder
on the shelf.

00:30:14.830 --> 00:30:20.140
How many of you actively use your business
plans at work day in and day out to drive

00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:21.890
your activities?

00:30:21.890 --> 00:30:26.070
Okay, a couple people.

00:30:26.070 --> 00:30:31.420
A lot of the Fortune 500 companies that I
do work with this is kind of the scenario.

00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:37.710
They have a plan, it sits in a binder, sits
in a PowerPoint deck.

00:30:37.710 --> 00:30:42.200
Here's what they do day in and day out and
there's no link.

00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:43.750
There's no link.

00:30:43.750 --> 00:30:49.140
So what we want to do is try and create that
link between what is the plan that we have

00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:51.510
and what are we doing day in and day out.

00:30:51.510 --> 00:30:57.160
And so one of the more common planning tools
that's out there is SWOT analysis and I know

00:30:57.160 --> 00:31:01.750
SWOT analysis is the most commonly used strategic
planning tool in the world but in my opinion

00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:03.860
it's probably the most misused.

00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:08.330
Because we've seen SWOT analysis, strengths,
weaknesses, opportunities, threats.

00:31:08.330 --> 00:31:11.150
We say yeah, yeah, yeah, been there done that.

00:31:11.150 --> 00:31:15.560
But if we do it correctly we can generate
some insights and help start at least the

00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:17.320
foundation of that plan.

00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:21.140
And what I want to share with you today is
not just SWOT but what would you do after

00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:24.840
a SWOT analysis to actually develop strategy
for your life.

00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:27.370
I'll show you a quick example.

00:31:27.370 --> 00:31:32.270
Here's a SWOT example that you might have,
strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats.

00:31:32.270 --> 00:31:38.321
Strengths, coaching, maybe you do some volunteer
work with your daughter's ice-skating team

00:31:38.321 --> 00:31:40.180
or your son's baseball team.

00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:42.730
Maybe you like to coach maybe you're good
at that.

00:31:42.730 --> 00:31:46.450
Maybe you're a leader at school, there's a
parent teacher organization and you do a lot

00:31:46.450 --> 00:31:48.400
of good work with that.

00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:51.800
Maybe you have fund-raising abilities, maybe
you're working with a couple nonprofits and

00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:57.250
obviously as the economy has been poorer it's
difficult for nonprofits to survive so you've

00:31:57.250 --> 00:32:00.580
used some of your fund-raising abilities that's
a strength.

00:32:00.580 --> 00:32:03.270
Weaknesses maybe we're not as good a listener
as we could be.

00:32:03.270 --> 00:32:08.110
Maybe we've been in a relationship for a long
time and we're not really locked in and listening

00:32:08.110 --> 00:32:12.440
to what our partner or spouse or significant
other is saying.

00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:14.990
Maybe we're too quick to judge folks.

00:32:14.990 --> 00:32:20.460
A lot of times we look at somebody and you
take 10 seconds and you say I know what that

00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:22.410
person's about.

00:32:22.410 --> 00:32:25.090
So maybe we need to step back a little bit
there.

00:32:25.090 --> 00:32:29.590
Maybe we're not fully engaged with family
at home, maybe work's taking over, e-mail,

00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:30.970
texting, Twitter.

00:32:30.970 --> 00:32:35.050
Maybe we're doing a lot of that stuff and
we're not fully engaged when we're home.

00:32:35.050 --> 00:32:39.740
Opportunities, maybe the formation of a new
nonprofit group, training for new managers

00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:44.800
at work, maybe there's an executive-led manager-led
class that we could be a part of.

00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:48.530
And then maybe our daughter's interest in
art is an opportunity for us.

00:32:48.530 --> 00:32:52.410
Threats, maybe there's some company downsizing.

00:32:52.410 --> 00:32:54.070
Community's lack of participation.

00:32:54.070 --> 00:32:58.950
Maybe people aren't reaching out and helping
as much as they used to with community events.

00:32:58.950 --> 00:33:03.000
And then maybe there's a property tax increase
that financially we need to think about because

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.930
maybe that affects some of our vacation plans.

00:33:05.930 --> 00:33:11.320
So what we can do then is once we developed
a SWOT analysis we can say how do we prioritize

00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:13.910
the opportunities that we have?

00:33:13.910 --> 00:33:18.220
You all have time, talent and finances to
some degree.

00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:21.170
How do you prioritize where that goes?

00:33:21.170 --> 00:33:25.920
You can use an opportunity matrix to do that
looking at two criteria.

00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:28.140
What's the probability of achievement?

00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:31.870
If I put my resources, my time, my talent,
my budget to that?

00:33:31.870 --> 00:33:34.800
And then what's the impact on my life if I
do?

00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:40.440
Very common tool that we use in business to
vet opportunities when you can use it in your

00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:41.850
personal life as well.

00:33:41.850 --> 00:33:46.530
So maybe when we plot our opportunities, we
say well the formation of the nonprofit group

00:33:46.530 --> 00:33:50.480
the probability is not as high because that's
dependent on a lot of other people and we're

00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:53.560
having difficulty getting people involved.

00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:57.410
Training for new managers, maybe the probability
of the impact is a little higher there.

00:33:57.410 --> 00:33:59.090
We've got good relationships at work.

00:33:59.090 --> 00:34:01.640
There's a need at work so maybe we can do
that.

00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:06.350
And then maybe the number one opportunity
is Suzy's interest in art.

00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:09.379
She's our daughter, we're maybe not spending
as much time at home.

00:34:09.379 --> 00:34:15.109
The impact could be great if we could find
out a way to be involved with that.

00:34:15.109 --> 00:34:18.740
Same thing with the threats that we face and
again threats are things that potentially

00:34:18.740 --> 00:34:23.049
can stop us from reaching our level of happiness
or success.

00:34:23.049 --> 00:34:28.320
What's the probability that that would occur
1 to 10, what's the impact on our lives?

00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:33.440
So again community's lack of participation,
probability is high the impact maybe not as

00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:34.539
much on us.

00:34:34.539 --> 00:34:38.919
The property tax increase something that we're
thinking about, the company layoffs again

00:34:38.919 --> 00:34:42.099
maybe the biggest thing that kind of is top
of mind.

00:34:42.099 --> 00:34:47.029
So now you say, 'okay great Rich we did the
SWOT analysis, we prioritize our opportunities

00:34:47.029 --> 00:34:49.909
and threats so what?'

00:34:49.909 --> 00:34:53.690
That's the biggest question I get when I do
strategic planning with companies is we did

00:34:53.690 --> 00:34:56.389
SWOT analysis, so what?

00:34:56.389 --> 00:34:58.289
Who cares?

00:34:58.289 --> 00:35:00.440
We don't do anything with it.

00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:06.049
So this last tool is a way to take your SWOT
analysis, your strengths, weaknesses, opportunities,

00:35:06.049 --> 00:35:09.240
and threats and actually create strategies.

00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:10.240
Okay?

00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:16.040
I know this is a little busy but what you've
done is you have your strengths and weaknesses

00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:17.260
at the top.

00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:20.170
You already did that as part of your SWOT
analysis.

00:35:20.170 --> 00:35:23.710
You have your opportunities and threats listed
on the left-hand side.

00:35:23.710 --> 00:35:27.530
You've already created those in your SWOT
analysis.

00:35:27.530 --> 00:35:33.630
All you're doing now is you're playing around
with the combination of your strengths and

00:35:33.630 --> 00:35:40.480
weaknesses which are your internal capabilities,
relative to your opportunities and threats

00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:43.320
which are your external possibilities.

00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:48.930
So we can see if we look at our strengths
and opportunities we have leadership ability

00:35:48.930 --> 00:35:53.830
at school, coaching, maybe we haven't really
used that at work.

00:35:53.830 --> 00:35:58.930
So one of the opportunities is to use that
leadership ability to create a proposal to

00:35:58.930 --> 00:36:03.779
lead one of those managerial classes at work.

00:36:03.779 --> 00:36:07.349
If we drop down and look at strengths and
threats.

00:36:07.349 --> 00:36:11.900
One of the strengths that we have is fund-raising
abilities so maybe we create a fund-raising

00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:16.650
event for the community to generate greater
interest because that's a threat, the community's

00:36:16.650 --> 00:36:20.599
lack of interest to help needy children.

00:36:20.599 --> 00:36:26.000
So again if you do SWOT analysis as part of
your work or part of your life, this is a

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:31.720
way for you to line those things up to create
some strategies.

00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:38.430
To create some direction for how you're using
your time and your talent.

00:36:38.430 --> 00:36:39.940
Okay?

00:36:39.940 --> 00:36:44.750
So the last step, the fifth step is drive.

00:36:44.750 --> 00:36:48.569
When we think about the word drive, it could
have a lot of different connotations.

00:36:48.569 --> 00:36:54.369
A very leisurely Sunday drive, maybe in the
mountains just relaxing.

00:36:54.369 --> 00:37:00.549
Maybe you're thinking more of a Formula One
race car or NASCAR trading paint.

00:37:00.549 --> 00:37:06.299
But the word drive really talks about, really
means to put effort forth.

00:37:06.299 --> 00:37:09.999
To move something from one spot to another.

00:37:09.999 --> 00:37:14.480
We can do all the thinking, we can do all
the planning we want but at the end of the

00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:22.099
day if we don't have the preparation and the
perseverance and the will to move things forward

00:37:22.099 --> 00:37:23.930
then we've wasted time.

00:37:23.930 --> 00:37:28.509
I work with a lot of organizations when I
look at how they've done planning in the past,

00:37:28.509 --> 00:37:30.200
there's no drive.

00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:35.650
They've spent the time in the two-day off-site
meeting at the Holiday Inn twice a year but

00:37:35.650 --> 00:37:39.230
when it comes to executing, they're not executing.

00:37:39.230 --> 00:37:45.109
So we want to talk a little bit about what's
a way, what's a tool for us to drive success

00:37:45.109 --> 00:37:48.920
in our personal lives and potentially at work.

00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:53.190
And the tool that we could potentially use
is called an activity system map.

00:37:53.190 --> 00:37:59.089
An activity system map is simply a way to
look at your life, to look at your business

00:37:59.089 --> 00:38:01.880
on one page, one page.

00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:08.760
And there's really two components, the first
component is your strategic themes.

00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:17.130
Your strategic themes are the 3 to 5 areas
that really you want to invest the most resources

00:38:17.130 --> 00:38:21.859
in to provide that value to yourself, to the
other people in your life.

00:38:21.859 --> 00:38:28.799
So 3 to 5 areas that really you want to focus
on this year to reach your potential.

00:38:28.799 --> 00:38:31.490
The tactics then, are the second part.

00:38:31.490 --> 00:38:37.050
The tactics are activities are the things
that you're actually going to do to realize

00:38:37.050 --> 00:38:38.710
those strategies.

00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:41.710
So let's look at an example.

00:38:41.710 --> 00:38:49.230
Our strategic themes might be empathy, teaching
and growth, as we look at our plan for 2012

00:38:49.230 --> 00:38:51.060
on an individual level.

00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:54.580
Empathy, teaching and growth those are our
three strategic themes.

00:38:54.580 --> 00:39:00.950
Those are the areas we want to invest our
time and our talent into.

00:39:00.950 --> 00:39:07.539
The tactics or activities then support those,
so for growth it might be things like committing

00:39:07.539 --> 00:39:09.510
to exercise five days a week.

00:39:09.510 --> 00:39:14.230
Joining Toastmasters, public speaking group
so that I can successfully lead that class

00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:19.700
at work that I talked about earlier and maybe
researching cultures, foreign countries that

00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:24.819
we're considering visiting so that my spouse
or partner can have a wonderful time if we

00:39:24.819 --> 00:39:27.509
do make that trip overseas.

00:39:27.509 --> 00:39:30.140
So individually those things don't look that
important.

00:39:30.140 --> 00:39:36.260
But where the power comes from is when you
develop this map fully and you've said to

00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:41.710
yourself here are the 3 to 5 areas I'm gonna
focus on and here are the actual things I'm

00:39:41.710 --> 00:39:48.819
gonna do to realize my potential in those
areas, okay?

00:39:48.819 --> 00:39:52.009
So empathy, practicing the active listening
at home.

00:39:52.009 --> 00:39:57.339
Volunteering, mentoring, teaching, coaching,
fund-raising in the community.

00:39:57.339 --> 00:40:01.829
We talked about the class and maybe learning
new subjects in summer with our kids.

00:40:01.829 --> 00:40:08.470
Maybe that art class with Suzy that we both
take together.

00:40:08.470 --> 00:40:13.809
So we want to think about how do we simply
capture our strategy for our life?

00:40:13.809 --> 00:40:19.489
The activity system map is one way to help
us drive that day in and day out.

00:40:19.489 --> 00:40:24.319
Whether it's in business or your personal
life great strategy should be simple.

00:40:24.319 --> 00:40:28.009
I have a daughter named Jessie, she's six
years old.

00:40:28.009 --> 00:40:31.849
And her favorite book is the Dr. Seuss book
"Green Eggs and Ham."

00:40:31.849 --> 00:40:37.839
And if Dr. Seuss was a strategist I think
he would've written something along the lines

00:40:37.839 --> 00:40:41.970
of, 'I am strategic, strategic I am.

00:40:41.970 --> 00:40:43.940
Do you like to think strategically?

00:40:43.940 --> 00:40:49.240
I do not like to think strategically not in
an office, not in a tree, it's more fun to

00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:50.270
think tactically.

00:40:50.270 --> 00:40:52.829
Stuff I can touch, stuff I can see.

00:40:52.829 --> 00:40:57.480
I do not like to think strategically, I haven't
the time to be so leisurely.

00:40:57.480 --> 00:41:02.770
Setting good brands I'll leave to others gotta
check my BlackBerry even in bed under the

00:41:02.770 --> 00:41:03.770
covers.

00:41:03.770 --> 00:41:06.180
[Laughter]
No I do not like to think strategically.

00:41:06.180 --> 00:41:11.619
I prefer the adrenaline rush of mindless reactivity.

00:41:11.619 --> 00:41:14.089
You do not like to think strategically so
you say.

00:41:14.089 --> 00:41:16.400
Try it, try it and you may.

00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:19.930
Say, I do like to think strategically.

00:41:19.930 --> 00:41:25.690
While others around me only fight fires I
focus my resources taking my business higher.

00:41:25.690 --> 00:41:28.029
I schedule time just to think.

00:41:28.029 --> 00:41:33.190
Now my goals and strategies are in perfect
sync.

00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:34.910
Strategic I am.'

00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:40.700
So the bottom line is we need to keep strategy
simple if we're actually going to do it day

00:41:40.700 --> 00:41:43.599
in and day out.

00:41:43.599 --> 00:41:49.890
The reality is if you don't carve out time
in your schedule either individually or with

00:41:49.890 --> 00:41:56.599
other people to think about your work, to
think about your life, it's going to happen

00:41:56.599 --> 00:41:58.340
to you.

00:41:58.340 --> 00:42:01.790
It may happen well and it may not happen so
well.

00:42:01.790 --> 00:42:06.109
And are there going to be unexpected things
that happen along the way?

00:42:06.109 --> 00:42:07.180
Absolutely.

00:42:07.180 --> 00:42:12.079
But if you have no direction, if you haven't
channeled what you're good at, what you're

00:42:12.079 --> 00:42:17.839
passionate about, then you've wasted your
potential.

00:42:17.839 --> 00:42:25.220
Michelangelo was quoted as saying, "A person
paints with their mind not with their hands."

00:42:25.220 --> 00:42:31.450
We live in an action-oriented world, but never
forget that your success in business and your

00:42:31.450 --> 00:42:35.380
personal life begins here first.

00:42:35.380 --> 00:42:44.589
Give yourself permission, time and tools to
think strategically.

00:42:44.589 --> 00:42:50.700
Strategy is the bridge from where you are
today to where you want to go.

00:42:50.700 --> 00:43:00.160
Without that bridge, you have no way of successfully
spanning the gaps in your life.

00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:06.549
Without that bridge, you don't have a way
to overcome the barriers in certain cases.

00:43:06.549 --> 00:43:12.839
But with that strategy or with that bridge,
you have the power to go from where you are

00:43:12.839 --> 00:43:15.700
today to where you want to go.

00:43:15.700 --> 00:43:22.970
The question is will you use your potential
to reach that destination?

00:43:22.970 --> 00:43:27.259
What I'd like to do now is open it up for
any comment, any questions, any thoughts that

00:43:27.259 --> 00:43:28.259
you might have.

00:43:28.259 --> 00:43:32.460
I always enjoy hearing from people, how they've
approached planning whether it's for their

00:43:32.460 --> 00:43:37.910
business or for their personal lives and an
opportunity to maybe share some best practices.

00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:43.859
So we do, there's a microphone here or we
can just pop up.

00:43:43.859 --> 00:43:55.770
&gt;&gt;female #1: [Inaudible]
&gt;&gt;Rich: Yeah, so the question was once you

00:43:55.770 --> 00:43:57.609
develop your strategy.

00:43:57.609 --> 00:44:02.440
You know that's one thing but how do you get
that resolution to kind of see it through?

00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:04.539
A lot of people make New Year's resolutions
right?

00:44:04.539 --> 00:44:08.640
And it's the beginning of March and probably
for a lot of people, they're sort of gone

00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:09.640
now.

00:44:09.640 --> 00:44:13.019
So the question becomes how do we stay focused
on it?

00:44:13.019 --> 00:44:21.480
I'm a big believer in the fact that concepts
change thinking and tools change behavior.

00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:24.820
So if you're gonna change your behavior, if
you're gonna actually follow through on your

00:44:24.820 --> 00:44:28.019
strategies you have to have a tool.

00:44:28.019 --> 00:44:32.760
Something like an activity system map with
the three bubbles that sits on your desk or

00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:37.059
sits on your nightstand or on your bathroom
counter that you're looking at on a regular

00:44:37.059 --> 00:44:39.819
basis to trigger that change in behavior.

00:44:39.819 --> 00:44:44.790
If you don't have a way in your environment
to change that behavior it's not gonna happen.

00:44:44.790 --> 00:44:50.339
So the best successes I've heard from people
are to have a trigger that changes behavior.

00:44:50.339 --> 00:44:53.910
Something like the activity system map can
do that for you.

00:44:53.910 --> 00:44:55.349
Thank you.

00:44:55.349 --> 00:44:57.269
Other comments, thoughts?

00:44:57.269 --> 00:44:58.269
Okay.

00:44:58.269 --> 00:45:02.640
Well, I'll stick around, oh, I'm sorry yeah.

00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:10.170
&gt;&gt;male #1: Can you show what to do with his
web analysis again?

00:45:10.170 --> 00:45:12.130
You had this chart with weaknesses and such.

00:45:12.130 --> 00:45:13.130
&gt;&gt;Rich: Yeah,
&gt;&gt;male #1: That one.

00:45:13.130 --> 00:45:14.130
&gt;&gt;Rich: This one?

00:45:14.130 --> 00:45:15.130
&gt;&gt;male #1: That one, yes.

00:45:15.130 --> 00:45:16.220
&gt;&gt;Rich: Yeah, so what you're doing is you're
lining up your strengths and weaknesses, and

00:45:16.220 --> 00:45:17.260
your opportunities and threats.

00:45:17.260 --> 00:45:22.160
And you're just using these four boxes as
kind of a methodical way to think through.

00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:26.430
So this box your meshing your strengths and
your opportunities together.

00:45:26.430 --> 00:45:30.529
So you're saying here are the things I can
take advantage of, how can I do that with

00:45:30.529 --> 00:45:32.180
what I'm good at?

00:45:32.180 --> 00:45:35.089
If we go down here, we're matching our strengths
and our threats.

00:45:35.089 --> 00:45:39.630
So these are things potentially that can prevent
us from being happy or successful.

00:45:39.630 --> 00:45:44.519
How do we use our strengths to prevent those
things from derailing our efforts?

00:45:44.519 --> 00:45:50.609
So you're just using these four boxes as kind
of a trigger to think through what you're

00:45:50.609 --> 00:45:54.869
good at or where you have weaknesses, what
you can take advantage of and what can hurt

00:45:54.869 --> 00:45:55.869
you.

00:45:55.869 --> 00:45:56.869
&gt;&gt;male #1: Thank you.

00:45:56.869 --> 00:45:57.869
Yeah.

00:45:57.869 --> 00:45:59.970
&gt;&gt;Alex: So hello?

00:45:59.970 --> 00:46:01.349
So my name is Alex Arris.

00:46:01.349 --> 00:46:02.349
&gt;&gt;Rich: Hi Alex.

00:46:02.349 --> 00:46:05.640
&gt;&gt;Alex: Thank you for coming and giving this
talk.

00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:11.829
I very much empathize with you about strategies
and the importance of them and being organized

00:46:11.829 --> 00:46:14.339
and having an orderly life or something.

00:46:14.339 --> 00:46:17.020
I doubt that every person is like that.

00:46:17.020 --> 00:46:18.910
&gt;&gt;Rich: You're right, very few, 15%.

00:46:18.910 --> 00:46:23.809
&gt;&gt;Alex: And I don't know what to do with that,
but you may know better.

00:46:23.809 --> 00:46:32.980
So one thing is that I have used strategies
even though I am like an organized person,

00:46:32.980 --> 00:46:35.130
I felt disappointed.

00:46:35.130 --> 00:46:36.559
&gt;&gt;Rich: Okay.

00:46:36.559 --> 00:46:43.910
&gt;&gt;Alex: So one strategy that I used was in
order to become a professor, I applied to

00:46:43.910 --> 00:46:46.470
universities and I had this strategy.

00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:52.480
I had tactics, maybe informally, not written
down, or actually written down but in other

00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:53.480
terms.

00:46:53.480 --> 00:46:54.480
&gt;&gt;Rich: Okay.

00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:58.680
&gt;&gt;Alex: So I applied to five universities
every week, I ended up applying to 72 universities,

00:46:58.680 --> 00:47:02.460
I got one phone interview which nothing happened.

00:47:02.460 --> 00:47:15.769
And, but I got an offer from Google after
things that I have not planned at all like

00:47:15.769 --> 00:47:17.130
someone referred me.

00:47:17.130 --> 00:47:18.230
I got a call.

00:47:18.230 --> 00:47:19.869
I miss that call.

00:47:19.869 --> 00:47:27.079
They called me again I went back another time
and then I don't know.

00:47:27.079 --> 00:47:29.019
They were very interested.

00:47:29.019 --> 00:47:30.329
I couldn't say no.

00:47:30.329 --> 00:47:33.150
I came gave it a chance and now I'm here.

00:47:33.150 --> 00:47:34.150
&gt;&gt;Rich: Okay.

00:47:34.150 --> 00:47:40.829
&gt;&gt;Alex: So I just wanted, maybe that's a comment
maybe you can comment on it but I have another

00:47:40.829 --> 00:47:42.299
thing to.

00:47:42.299 --> 00:47:45.099
So that's more like a question.

00:47:45.099 --> 00:47:53.950
What do you do when you plan out the strategy
or tactic and then you have all that work

00:47:53.950 --> 00:47:59.999
done and you just find that you don't want
to do it?

00:47:59.999 --> 00:48:03.089
I had forced myself to do it.

00:48:03.089 --> 00:48:04.750
It was hard, didn't work.

00:48:04.750 --> 00:48:07.609
&gt;&gt;Rich: Yeah, so to both of those things and
thank you very much I think they're both a

00:48:07.609 --> 00:48:09.569
great comment and a great question.

00:48:09.569 --> 00:48:13.720
I think the reality is that the first step
that we talked about, discover.

00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:15.849
You've got understand what's your purpose.

00:48:15.849 --> 00:48:21.589
And I'm a big believer in identify what's
your purpose in life, why are you here?

00:48:21.589 --> 00:48:26.570
To your point, that purpose may translate
into a lot of different things.

00:48:26.570 --> 00:48:28.940
Maybe it's a professor, maybe it's not.

00:48:28.940 --> 00:48:31.979
Maybe it's a leader here at Google, maybe
it's not.

00:48:31.979 --> 00:48:37.130
So you've got to find your purpose, how that
actually gets translated into the real world

00:48:37.130 --> 00:48:40.009
to your point is gonna be a surprise sometimes.

00:48:40.009 --> 00:48:41.369
And that's fine.

00:48:41.369 --> 00:48:47.141
But what I see too often is people moving
from one spot to another with no idea of what

00:48:47.141 --> 00:48:48.141
their purpose is.

00:48:48.141 --> 00:48:53.789
Meaning where that intersection of talent
and passion and knowledge and skill is.

00:48:53.789 --> 00:48:57.989
Because if you understand what that is you
can bring value to a lot of people whether

00:48:57.989 --> 00:49:00.450
it's for-profit or nonprofit.

00:49:00.450 --> 00:49:02.500
But the key is to first uncover that.

00:49:02.500 --> 00:49:06.940
So it sounds like you've uncovered it, and
there's channels and I talk in the book about

00:49:06.940 --> 00:49:08.559
your purpose channels.

00:49:08.559 --> 00:49:12.569
So one channel might be professor but you
haven't pursued that yet.

00:49:12.569 --> 00:49:15.480
But that's not to say in 10 years you may
be a professor.

00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:20.281
But right now the channel is Google and the
question is for you moving forward is how

00:49:20.281 --> 00:49:22.799
do you maximize that at Google?

00:49:22.799 --> 00:49:24.359
So excellent points thank you very much.

00:49:24.359 --> 00:49:25.359
&gt;&gt;Alex: Sure.

00:49:25.359 --> 00:49:26.359
Appreciate it.

00:49:26.359 --> 00:49:27.359
Any other comments, thoughts?

00:49:27.359 --> 00:49:28.359
No?

00:49:28.359 --> 00:49:32.200
Okay, well, thanks very much I hope you have
a great rest of the day folks.

00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:33.200
Thanks.

00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:33.201
[Applause]
