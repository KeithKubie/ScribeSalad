Hi, I'm Ian Lake.

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:04.770
And I strongly believe
that theming with AppCompat

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.970
is what takes your app
from good to great.

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.190
So AppCompat uses the pattern
introduced in Lollipop

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:15.030
where you can declare a
set of colors in your theme

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.300
which automatically change a
number of elements in your UI.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.480
There's three main colors--
colorPrimary, colorPrimaryDark,

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.490
and colorAccent.

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.390
colorPrimary is where you start,
and serves as the main branding

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.320
color throughout your app.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.500
If you're using a
standard AppCompat theme,

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.430
you'll find the app bar uses
colorPrimary by default.

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.410
If you're using a
toolbar, set the color

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:44.090
using the background attribute
with attribute colorPrimary.

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.580
colorPrimaryDark is only
applicable to Android

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.300
5.0 and higher devices, and
serves as the background color

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.590
for the status bar, and
should, as the name implies,

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.340
be a darker shade of
your primary color.

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.320
colorAccent is
slightly different,

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.670
and that affects a
wide number of elements

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.240
throughout your app.

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.140
You'll notice it in EditText
focus, underline, and cursor.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.380
Check CheckBoxes, as well
the background color,

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.720
for the floating action button.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.590
Very important that it contrasts
with both your primary color

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.790
and your background colors
so it remains legible.

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.780
There's a few other colors which
are less often used, but can

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.680
be really useful.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.260
colorControlNormal controls
the normal state of components,

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.780
such as an unselected EditText.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.650
colorControlActivated overrides
colorAccent as the activated

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.510
or checked state for
items such as CheckBoxes.

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.110
And colorControlHighlight, which
controls the ripple coloring.

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.900
So lots of customization is
possible without touching

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.940
any individual components.

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.280
But this powerful theming
isn't limited only

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.570
to the entire activity.

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.890
You could also apply a theme
to any view in your app using

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.710
the android:theme attribute,
which lets you change only that

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.010
view and its children.

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.910
To make this easy, there's
a concept of a ThemeOverlay.

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.350
ThemeOverlays,
unlike a full theme,

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.880
only seek to change the
few things they need to.

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.330
This would be appropriate
for changing elements

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.970
in a normally light theme for
display in a dark background,

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.860
say an app bar with
a dark primary color.

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.090
When building a
custom theme overlay,

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.310
make sure your parent theme
is ThemeOverlay.AppCompat.

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.810
This ensures that elements
such as colorAccent

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.550
work properly on both Lollipop
and pre-Lollipop devices.

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.600
So themes and ThemeOverlays
can be a powerful way

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.600
to change the look of your app,
either at the activity or view

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:45.460
level.

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.200
One more tool to help
you build better apps.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.150
