00:00:06.576 --> 00:00:08.448
Mysteries of vernacular:

00:00:08.448 --> 00:00:09.768
Ukulele,

00:00:09.768 --> 00:00:12.741
a small, four-stringed guitar.

00:00:12.741 --> 00:00:15.324
Oddly enough, the word ukulele,

00:00:15.324 --> 00:00:16.960
in its native Hawaiian,

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.136
literally translates to jumping flea.

00:00:21.136 --> 00:00:22.279
Even more surprising,

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:25.735
the instrument itself did not originate in Hawaii.

00:00:25.735 --> 00:00:27.613
So, how did a Hawaiian word

00:00:27.613 --> 00:00:31.425
come to describe a non-Hawaiian instrument?

00:00:31.425 --> 00:00:33.344
Back in the late 1800s,

00:00:33.344 --> 00:00:36.440
King Kalākaua was the last reigning king

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.672
of the kingdom of Hawaii.

00:00:38.672 --> 00:00:41.098
He was nicknamed "The Merry Monarch"

00:00:41.098 --> 00:00:42.601
because of his joy for life

00:00:42.601 --> 00:00:45.897
and, in particular, his love of music.

00:00:45.897 --> 00:00:47.201
In the King's court,

00:00:47.201 --> 00:00:49.645
there was a former British army officer

00:00:49.645 --> 00:00:51.730
named Edward Purvis.

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:52.813
Though a small man,

00:00:52.813 --> 00:00:54.652
he was quite lively,

00:00:54.652 --> 00:00:57.518
and his nickname was "Jumping Flea,"

00:00:57.518 --> 00:01:00.377
"Ukulele" in Hawaiian.

00:01:00.377 --> 00:01:04.400
Like the King, he was a great lover of music.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.563
In 1879, a group of Portuguese immigrants

00:01:07.563 --> 00:01:10.018
arrived on the islands of Hawaii,

00:01:10.018 --> 00:01:12.700
bringing with them a small, four-stringed guitar

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.506
known as a braguinha.

00:01:15.506 --> 00:01:18.187
Purvis was immediately taken with the instrument

00:01:18.187 --> 00:01:20.187
and helped spread its popularity

00:01:20.187 --> 00:01:22.084
throughout the King's court.

00:01:22.084 --> 00:01:23.575
As the story goes,

00:01:23.575 --> 00:01:26.935
it was not long before his nickname, Ukulele,

00:01:26.935 --> 00:01:30.616
jumped from the man to his favorite instrument.

00:01:30.616 --> 00:01:33.496
As demand grew, several Portuguese families

00:01:33.496 --> 00:01:35.074
began to manufacture

00:01:35.074 --> 00:01:38.173
the minuscule guitar on the islands,

00:01:38.173 --> 00:01:40.046
making small modifications

00:01:40.046 --> 00:01:44.020
until it became the same ukulele we recognize today.
