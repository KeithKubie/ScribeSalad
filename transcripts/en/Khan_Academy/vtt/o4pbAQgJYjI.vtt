00:00:00.184 --> 00:00:03.672
- The following two equations
form a linear system.

00:00:03.672 --> 00:00:05.818
This is one equation; it has X and Y

00:00:05.818 --> 00:00:07.418
so it's gonna define a line.

00:00:07.418 --> 00:00:09.584
And then I have another
equation that involves X and Y,

00:00:09.584 --> 00:00:11.251
so it's gonna define another line.

00:00:11.251 --> 00:00:13.151
It says: "Graph the system of equations

00:00:13.151 --> 00:00:14.551
"and find its solution."

00:00:14.551 --> 00:00:16.284
So we're gonna try to find it visually.

00:00:16.284 --> 00:00:18.191
So let's graph this first one.

00:00:18.191 --> 00:00:21.018
To graph this line, I have
the little graphing tool here.

00:00:21.018 --> 00:00:23.118
Notice if I can figure out two points,

00:00:23.118 --> 00:00:24.251
I can move those points around

00:00:24.251 --> 00:00:27.398
and it's going to define our line for us.

00:00:27.398 --> 00:00:29.385
I'm gonna pick two X values and figure out

00:00:29.385 --> 00:00:33.251
the corresponding Y values
and then graph the line.

00:00:33.251 --> 00:00:35.618
So let's see how I could do this.

00:00:35.618 --> 00:00:37.084
So let's see; an easy one is what happens

00:00:37.084 --> 00:00:38.951
when X is equal to zero?

00:00:38.951 --> 00:00:41.451
Well if X is equal to zero,
everything I just shaded

00:00:41.451 --> 00:00:45.618
goes away and we're left
with -3y is equal to nine.

00:00:45.618 --> 00:00:50.184
So -3y equals nine. Y
would be negative three.

00:00:50.184 --> 00:00:54.584
So when X is equal to zero,
Y would be negative three.

00:00:54.584 --> 00:00:55.552
So let me graph that.

00:00:55.552 --> 00:00:58.508
When X is equal to zero,

00:00:58.508 --> 00:01:01.918
X is zero, Y is negative three.

00:01:01.918 --> 00:01:03.652
Now another easy point
actually instead of trying

00:01:03.652 --> 00:01:06.851
another X value, let's think
about when Y is equal to zero

00:01:06.851 --> 00:01:08.984
'cause these equations
are in a standard form

00:01:08.984 --> 00:01:10.218
so it's easy to just test.

00:01:10.218 --> 00:01:12.418
Well what are the X and Y intercepts?

00:01:12.418 --> 00:01:16.882
So when Y is equal to zero,

00:01:16.882 --> 00:01:20.375
this term goes away,
and you have negative X

00:01:20.375 --> 00:01:25.375
is equal to nine, or X would
be equal to negative nine.

00:01:25.685 --> 00:01:29.181
So when Y is zero, X is negative nine.

00:01:29.181 --> 00:01:32.458
So when Y is zero,

00:01:32.458 --> 00:01:34.568
X is negative nine,

00:01:34.568 --> 00:01:37.718
or when X is negative nine, Y is zero.

00:01:37.718 --> 00:01:42.517
So I've just plotted this first equation.

00:01:42.517 --> 00:01:45.084
So now let's do the second
one. We'll do the same thing.

00:01:45.084 --> 00:01:47.551
What happens when X is equal to zero?

00:01:47.551 --> 00:01:49.851
When X is equal to zero,

00:01:49.851 --> 00:01:53.818
so this is going to be
our Y intercept now.

00:01:53.818 --> 00:01:57.584
When X is equal to zero, -6y
is equal to negative six.

00:01:57.584 --> 00:02:00.118
Well Y would have to be equal to one.

00:02:00.118 --> 00:02:04.718
So when X is zero, Y is equal to one.

00:02:04.718 --> 00:02:07.985
So when X is zero,

00:02:07.985 --> 00:02:10.052
Y is equal to one.

00:02:10.052 --> 00:02:11.051
Get one more point here.

00:02:11.051 --> 00:02:14.618
When Y is zero, when this term is zero,

00:02:14.618 --> 00:02:17.018
Y being zero would make
this entire term zero,

00:02:17.018 --> 00:02:19.584
then 6x is equal to negative six

00:02:19.584 --> 00:02:22.018
or X is equal to negative one.

00:02:22.018 --> 00:02:24.218
So when Y is zero, X is negative one

00:02:24.218 --> 00:02:27.118
or when X is negative one, Y is zero.

00:02:27.118 --> 00:02:30.798
When X is negative one,

00:02:30.798 --> 00:02:33.258
Y is zero.

00:02:33.258 --> 00:02:36.028
And so just like that,
I've plotted the two lines.

00:02:36.028 --> 00:02:39.818
And the solution to the
system are the X and Y values

00:02:39.818 --> 00:02:43.819
that satisfy both equations;
and if they satisfy

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:46.285
both equations, that means
they sit on both lines.

00:02:46.285 --> 00:02:48.585
And so in order to be on both lines,

00:02:48.585 --> 00:02:50.319
they're going to be at
the point of intersection.

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:52.218
And I see this point of
intersection right over here,

00:02:52.218 --> 00:02:54.984
it looks pretty clear that
this is the point X is equal

00:02:54.984 --> 00:02:59.485
to negative three and Y
is equal to negative two.

00:02:59.485 --> 00:03:02.252
So it's the point negative
three comma negative two.

00:03:02.252 --> 00:03:03.884
So let me write that down.

00:03:03.884 --> 00:03:08.484
Negative three comma negative two.

00:03:08.484 --> 00:03:11.685
And then I could check
my answer; got it right.

00:03:11.685 --> 00:03:13.584
Let's do another. Let's
do another one of these.

00:03:13.584 --> 00:03:16.151
Maybe of a different type.

00:03:16.151 --> 00:03:18.485
So over here it says: "A
system of two linear equations

00:03:18.485 --> 00:03:19.788
"is graphed below.

00:03:19.788 --> 00:03:23.150
"Approximate the solution of the system."

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.285
Alright so here I just have
to just look at this carefully

00:03:26.285 --> 00:03:28.551
and think about where this point is.

00:03:28.551 --> 00:03:30.251
So let's think about first its X value.

00:03:30.251 --> 00:03:32.035
So its X value,

00:03:32.035 --> 00:03:34.585
it's about right there
in terms of its X value.

00:03:34.585 --> 00:03:38.599
It looks like, so this is negative one.

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:40.752
This is negative two, so negative 1.5

00:03:40.752 --> 00:03:42.652
is gonna be right over here.

00:03:42.652 --> 00:03:46.585
It's a little bit to the
left of negative 1.5,

00:03:46.585 --> 00:03:50.898
so it's even more negative,
I would say negative 1.6.

00:03:50.898 --> 00:03:53.218
And I'm approximating it, negative 1.6.

00:03:53.218 --> 00:03:54.884
Hopefully it has a little leeway

00:03:54.884 --> 00:03:56.918
in how it checks the answer.

00:03:56.918 --> 00:03:58.384
What about the Y value?

00:03:58.384 --> 00:04:00.751
So if I look at the Y value here,

00:04:00.751 --> 00:04:04.650
it looks like it's a little
less than one and a half.

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.751
One and a half would be
halfway between one and two.

00:04:06.751 --> 00:04:08.484
It looks like it's a little
less than halfway between

00:04:08.484 --> 00:04:12.218
one and two, so I'd give it 1.4,

00:04:12.218 --> 00:04:14.451
positive 1.4.

00:04:14.451 --> 00:04:18.521
And let's check the answer,
see how we're doing.

00:04:18.521 --> 00:04:20.184
Yep, we got it right.

00:04:20.184 --> 00:04:23.784
Let's actually just do
one more for good measure.

00:04:23.784 --> 00:04:25.217
So this is another system.

00:04:25.217 --> 00:04:27.652
They've just written the equations in more

00:04:27.652 --> 00:04:29.717
of our slope intercept form.

00:04:29.717 --> 00:04:32.650
So let's see, Y is equal to
negative seven, X plus three.

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:35.018
When X is equal to zero,
we have our Y intercept.

00:04:35.018 --> 00:04:36.818
Y is equal to three.

00:04:36.818 --> 00:04:40.851
So when X is equal to
zero, Y is equal to three.

00:04:40.851 --> 00:04:43.385
And then we see that our
slope is negative seven.

00:04:43.385 --> 00:04:47.818
When you increase X by one,
you decrease Y by seven.

00:04:47.818 --> 00:04:51.611
So when you increase X
by one, you decrease Y

00:04:51.611 --> 00:04:56.017
by one, two, three, four,

00:04:56.017 --> 00:04:58.884
five, six, and seven.

00:04:58.884 --> 00:05:00.618
When X goes from zero to one,

00:05:00.618 --> 00:05:02.785
Y went from three to negative four,

00:05:02.785 --> 00:05:05.818
it went down by seven,
so that's that first one.

00:05:05.818 --> 00:05:07.685
Now the second one: our Y intercept.

00:05:07.685 --> 00:05:09.985
When X is equal to zero,
Y is negative three,

00:05:09.985 --> 00:05:11.551
so let me graph that.

00:05:11.551 --> 00:05:15.185
When X is zero, Y is
equal to negative three.

00:05:15.185 --> 00:05:18.518
And then its slope is negative one.

00:05:18.518 --> 00:05:22.717
When X increases by
one, Y decreases by one.

00:05:22.717 --> 00:05:25.418
So the slope here is negative one.

00:05:25.418 --> 00:05:29.318
So when X increases by
one, Y decreases by one.

00:05:29.318 --> 00:05:31.851
And there you have it. You have
your point of intersection.

00:05:31.851 --> 00:05:35.385
You have the X-Y pair that
satisfies both equations.

00:05:35.385 --> 00:05:37.117
That is the point of intersection.

00:05:37.117 --> 00:05:38.685
It's gonna sit on both lines

00:05:38.685 --> 00:05:40.318
which is why it's the
point of intersection.

00:05:40.318 --> 00:05:42.485
And that's the point X equals one,

00:05:42.485 --> 00:05:45.051
Y is equal to negative four.

00:05:45.051 --> 00:05:48.118
So you have X equals one

00:05:48.118 --> 00:05:51.484
and Y is equal to negative four.

00:05:51.484 --> 00:05:55.135
And I can check my answer
and we got it right.
