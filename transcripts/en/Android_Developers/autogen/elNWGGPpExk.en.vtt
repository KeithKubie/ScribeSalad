question is quantitative data enough for

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750
question is quantitative data enough for
 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.510
question is quantitative data enough for
us to measure the efficiency over metal

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520
us to measure the efficiency over metal
 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:25.340

at the end for me in the app what we

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:22.500
at the end for me in the app what we
 

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:25.550
at the end for me in the app what we
found out is that eventually the fact

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:25.560
found out is that eventually the fact
 

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:29.030

for them so we worked in a solution we
 

00:06:50.309 --> 00:06:52.279
for them so we worked in a solution we
prototype different solutions to try to

we were able to do some of these things
 

00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:05.020
we were able to do some of these things
because we operate at that scale so

talking about engagement the first thing

00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:06.800
talking about engagement the first thing
 

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:09.630
talking about engagement the first thing
is how did we measure the engagement

00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:09.640
is how did we measure the engagement
 

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:12.010
is how did we measure the engagement
there are a bunch of metrics that we can

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:12.020
there are a bunch of metrics that we can
 

00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:15.100
there are a bunch of metrics that we can
use we looked at you know sessions per

we we do have feature level metrics as

00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:33.860
we we do have feature level metrics as
 

00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:35.920

well of course for engagement but we

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:35.930
well of course for engagement but we
 

00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:37.180
well of course for engagement but we
thought this was a good overall

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:37.190
thought this was a good overall
 

00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:40.030

us a comparison with some of the other

us a comparison with some of the other
 

00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:44.440
us a comparison with some of the other
apps so we said that let's stick to this

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:44.450
apps so we said that let's stick to this
 

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:47.410
apps so we said that let's stick to this
one so that's how we measured but what

00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:47.420
one so that's how we measured but what
 

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:51.640
one so that's how we measured but what
did we do to increase our engagement so

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:51.650
did we do to increase our engagement so
 

00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:54.580
did we do to increase our engagement so
the first thing was we realized we made

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:54.590
the first thing was we realized we made
 

00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:56.260
the first thing was we realized we made
this mistake many times as we were

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:56.270
this mistake many times as we were
 

00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:58.780
this mistake many times as we were
launching new things we realized that a

00:09:58.780 --> 00:09:58.790
launching new things we realized that a
 

00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:01.210
launching new things we realized that a
lot of our users didn't even know that

00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:01.220
lot of our users didn't even know that
 

00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:03.100
lot of our users didn't even know that
we had launched some of these things so

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:03.110
we had launched some of these things so
 

00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:05.650
we had launched some of these things so
we made the effort introducing some of

00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:05.660
we made the effort introducing some of
 

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:09.370
we made the effort introducing some of
these features to them we also ensured

00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:09.380
these features to them we also ensured
 

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:11.260
these features to them we also ensured
that we got users to upgrade to the

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:11.270
that we got users to upgrade to the
 

00:10:11.270 --> 00:10:12.910
that we got users to upgrade to the
latest version of the app which was

00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:12.920
latest version of the app which was
 

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:14.650
latest version of the app which was
spoken about in the last session as well

00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:14.660
spoken about in the last session as well
 

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:17.590
spoken about in the last session as well
this made a huge difference to us here

00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:17.600
this made a huge difference to us here
 

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.660
this made a huge difference to us here

so please focus on speed if that's

00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:54.300
so please focus on speed if that's
 

00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:55.519
so please focus on speed if that's
something you can do and please focus on

your app open speed and then we did we

00:10:59.930 --> 00:10:59.940
your app open speed and then we did we

looked at how is it that we can add more

00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:01.920
looked at how is it that we can add more
 

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:03.949
looked at how is it that we can add more
features what where should we look at

00:11:03.949 --> 00:11:03.959
features what where should we look at
 

00:11:03.959 --> 00:11:07.040
features what where should we look at
four more features for engagement and

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:07.050
four more features for engagement and
 

00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:09.110
four more features for engagement and
this is about going deeper into your

00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:09.120
this is about going deeper into your
 

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:11.210
this is about going deeper into your
existing use case so we were already

00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:11.220
existing use case so we were already
 

00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:15.910
existing use case so we were already
there in in the users life for calls

00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:15.920
there in in the users life for calls
 

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:18.170
there in in the users life for calls
when you get an incoming call we showed

00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:18.180
when you get an incoming call we showed
 

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:20.059
when you get an incoming call we showed
you caller ID or we told you it was spam

00:11:20.059 --> 00:11:20.069
you caller ID or we told you it was spam
 

00:11:20.069 --> 00:11:22.639
you caller ID or we told you it was spam
and that's great so we said how can we

00:11:22.639 --> 00:11:22.649
and that's great so we said how can we
 

00:11:22.649 --> 00:11:24.769
and that's great so we said how can we
participate even further into that

00:11:24.769 --> 00:11:24.779
participate even further into that
 

00:11:24.779 --> 00:11:27.230
participate even further into that
calling experience so that's when we

00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:27.240
calling experience so that's when we
 

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:29.629
calling experience so that's when we
built the dialing experience inside so

00:11:29.629 --> 00:11:29.639
built the dialing experience inside so
 

00:11:29.639 --> 00:11:32.110
built the dialing experience inside so
we went deeper into the calling space

00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:32.120
we went deeper into the calling space
 

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:35.120
we went deeper into the calling space
the other thing we did was while you can

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:35.130
the other thing we did was while you can
 

00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:37.040
the other thing we did was while you can
go deeper as well we also looked at

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:37.050
go deeper as well we also looked at
 

00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:41.030
go deeper as well we also looked at
slightly adjacent parallel use cases so

00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:41.040
slightly adjacent parallel use cases so
 

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:43.069
slightly adjacent parallel use cases so
we were already in the calling space and

00:11:43.069 --> 00:11:43.079
we were already in the calling space and
 

00:11:43.079 --> 00:11:44.540
we were already in the calling space and
we were doing really well users loved

00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:44.550
we were doing really well users loved
 

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:46.400
we were doing really well users loved
what we were doing and we said that's

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:46.410
what we were doing and we said that's
 

00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:48.319
what we were doing and we said that's
similar problem they were solving in the

00:11:48.319 --> 00:11:48.329
similar problem they were solving in the
 

00:11:48.329 --> 00:11:50.569
similar problem they were solving in the
calling space actually exists in the

00:11:50.569 --> 00:11:50.579
calling space actually exists in the
 

00:11:50.579 --> 00:11:53.540
calling space actually exists in the
messaging space as well so maybe we can

00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:53.550
messaging space as well so maybe we can
 

00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:55.639
messaging space as well so maybe we can
go horizontal and introduce messaging

00:11:55.639 --> 00:11:55.649
go horizontal and introduce messaging
 

00:11:55.649 --> 00:11:57.470
go horizontal and introduce messaging
and I think this was one of our biggest

00:11:57.470 --> 00:11:57.480
and I think this was one of our biggest
 

00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:59.210
and I think this was one of our biggest
gains in engagement that we went

00:11:59.210 --> 00:11:59.220
gains in engagement that we went
 

00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:04.040
gains in engagement that we went
horizontal and our users love that the

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:04.050
horizontal and our users love that the
 

00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:07.689
horizontal and our users love that the
other thing we we found was all our apps

00:12:07.689 --> 00:12:07.699
other thing we we found was all our apps
 

00:12:07.699 --> 00:12:10.309
other thing we we found was all our apps
