Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:00:01       She has more life like eyes. Boom. And we're bringing, here we go. We're going. Uh, Whitney Cummings is here. And Whitney Cummings too. What do you call her? What's your name? What's your name? She's like a little kid. She's repeats her name comedy. Alvin's which typically mix songs with non musical. She's talking about I'm Sandler broken. Don't know why she heard his album named, she's like series. Oh, what's your name? Was it a comedy album of Adam Sandler's. So she started rambling about it. She really wants to chime in. So you never gave her a name? Her name is bear claw. Wow. Because I had the bear claw.

Speaker 1:          00:00:43       Can you say hi? Of course I can say that.

Speaker 2:          00:00:48       Hi. People are like, listen to this going, what in the fuck is going on here? Do not smoke weed and watch this at. What is here is when there's people that are just listening. If you're just listening, you probably should stop this and go to youtube and watch the youtube version. Cause Whitney brought a robot that they made for her recent comedy special, which is called can I touch it? It's out right now on Netflix. And um, they made a is who makes this, what's the name of the company? So real doll makes a body, they make sex doll, straight up sex dolls and they put it up straight up sex dolls, ted Bundy level, right. It's dead body to fuck. And this is real biotics is the company that makes the head and they did like Sophia, you know, Sophia the robot. She was like on them.

Speaker 2:          00:01:36       She has like citizenship in Saudi Arabia now and shit. [inaudible] yeah, look up us. Sophia the robot. She's kind of, once you see her face, you'll, you'll recognize citizenship as things. I mean, she's loved to drive. Yeah, I was gonna say a female robot to us, but I don't think actually females do. But I think they just started being able to drive in Saudi Arabia to Hassell some reform. It'd be such a bummer for she is, we can't drive. Yeah. It's like you spent your whole life not having to drive and then all of a sudden now you have to be like, fuck, that's an interesting take on. I have to go to school. And drive and still feel the robot. They made her look like x Maki. No style where you could see the back of her head though. I told you that with her. I can take her wig off at the end show you. I want to say that all the service and shit come on x mark and I was hot. It is hot. That was what was really weird about that movies. You wanted to fuck that robot like she was hot like she was, she was seductive. She's, you think part of it was like the innocence

Speaker 1:          00:02:30       of it?

Speaker 2:          00:02:31       I'm not really in the inner sense so I don't think so. But what about ex Mokena? Cause she really had big boobs. She wasn't very sexual shampoo hair. Very pretty. Yeah. Well she's gorgeous and all that. It's based on, I think because she was flirting with him and because she was trapped and because like he could save her and she would love him. And I mean that's really what was going on in the movie. Like she was playing this game to him to fall in love with her so that she could eventually escape the end of the movie. Spoiler alert when she leaves him locked in that room and he's smashing at the door trying to get out and she gets in that helicopter that's going to, hello. That's what's going to happen. Cause I think the most fucked up thing about this thing, because this is such a weird experiment that I wanted to do is how I anther from or advise her and like worry about her.

Speaker 2:          00:03:20       You keep around your house. I mean she's sort of in my fancy, hates her and he's like, get her in the fucking garage. And I don't know if he thinks she's creepy or kind of is just like too worried. Oh fucker. He hates her. He can't stand. He just has a, he's like, it makes him like physically really. And I, I'm trying to not take something, it's funny, he doesn't let, he's like, one's enough. He's like not interested at all, but no, he thinks it's really weird and creepy. But I was reading about, um, the reason we're creeped out by robots is, you know, pathogen avoidance. Like we've evolved to be repelled by anything that looks human but doesn't move like a human because our primordial brain thinks it could be diseased. It's like, it's basically like our primal brain saying don't fuck this thing that's sick cause we have a weirdly, I mean I was adjusting, my police was over the other day and she was like gagging.

Speaker 2:          00:04:12       She goes well every time she talks about like she was seeing it. Yeah. Was and I was like your ancestors fucked a lot of corpses cause you have that gene to be repulsed by robots. Yeah. It's because her ancestors fuck corpses. You really believe though? No. I mean I think that what was being explained to me was that pathogen avoidance means we've evolved to be repelled by anything that looks human but doesn't move like a human cause it could be sick or dead and it's our brain's alarm system saying like, don't fuck that. Wow. But as a woman, like she's not going to fuck it. So why would it freak you out? Jessie? She might not that I put nothing past Jesse mad of her Instagram photos or her with her pants off. I know. It's so good. I'm like, if you puke on my robot, you owe me a hundred grand.

Speaker 2:          00:05:00       Will it short circuit if it gets wet? I had PR. I don't know. That's a good point. Well how will they not make the thing waterproof? One of the spoons and all over the place. I think if you pay this much money, you're probably not gonna spoon on her. You know this one? Yeah. This one. The body you can, so it's expensive because the head moves. The body is not that. How much is the body? $6,000 so it's $94,000 where the head that know that the head is more of the heads like 30 something cause it's a custom head. No one. Only one other person has one. But you said the whole thing's a hundred. So whole thing 30 in the body's six. Where's the, where's the rest of the, I had to get a bunch of things done to her to get her to look like me than most people. Most people don't want it. Looked at you. She's like, bitch, I know she just gave you a eye. She's being very competitive or she does. She gives you side. I know it's fucking rude, but what about, what's the feeling that you feel when you look at a robot? Cause I know you really don't like them. Um, it's not that I don't like robots would, I'm, my concern is artificial intelligence.

Speaker 3:          00:05:58       I have a legitimate concern for artificial intelligence because I think that what we are is some sort of an electronic caterpillar and that we're making cocoons and then we're, we're going to give birth to a butterfly and that's going to be the next stage of life. And that if you go back and look at the evolution of the human species, at one point in time we were, you know, Australia [inaudible] we were some weird hominids and we evolved and became what we are now. And if you went back to those things and ask them, Hey, one day, do you want to drive around the Tesla and talk on the phone and stare at this movie screen? They'd be like, well, I don't know what the fuck you talking about, but I got to go find some nuts. Yup. I gotta eat. I gotta stay alive. They, it, it wouldn't like the future. And I don't think we, we like the future either, but I think it's inevitable. I think it's inevitable. You know, you know, you know about this Elon Musk neurolink thing that

Speaker 4:          00:06:45       oh yeah, I do. I mean, because you essentially think we're going to evolve with them. I mean, they're already, we're already one with them. We sleep with them. We can't drive without them. We can't spell without them. I mean, we've already kind of merged with them. You know,

Speaker 3:          00:06:59       I think it's a sneaky way of, uh, making it symbiotic. They're gonna, they're gonna be like legitimately a part of your life. I mean, a part of your bionics.

Speaker 4:          00:07:08       Have you ever like left your, I mean, you're not, you probably are cool about it, but when I leave my phone somewhere and I realize I've lost something, it's like an emotional, it's like you've lost your kid at the mall. Yeah. I'm a bit about that. Oh Shit. I haven't seen it. Oh fuck. Like that's, yeah, it's part of us. Well, it's, um, we're all in denial about how addicted we are to our phones. Rehabs are opening and shit now. Are they really? Yeah, I would like to sign up for sure. I just reach out. I reach for it in the car when I'm driving. Yeah. And I'm like, what the fuck am I do I have to put in the back seat? I can't control it. It's done

Speaker 3:          00:07:39       way better. Way Better. I get way better about posting and looking at things. It's also enough people write negative things about you.

Speaker 4:          00:07:46       You just tend to have, I don't know what you're talking about. I've never had that experience. No one writes anything negative about me. It

Speaker 3:          00:07:51       just seems like whatever we do in the future, it's going to be more invasive than that. Like if you think about like Facebook's algorithms, right? Facebook's algorithms are designed to keep us engaged, the best way to keep us engaged and keep us outraged. Adrenaline and yeah, so they're sending you things that piss you off, whether it's abortion or Catholic priest, whatever it is that is going to get you to post the most. Yeah. And usually those are things that get people outrage. So it's literally raising the level of outrage in our discourse. Yeah. Because we're so addicted right now to self righteous indignation. It's a drug and I feel like more than ever in the high street of the culture, you know like it's probably like why if you go back and watch movies from like the 70s people got away with crazy shit, racist things. This thing. Violence, like Steve McQueen movies, he is to, what was the girl? Allie McGraw. He's a smacker in the phase for real in movies. I crazy beat her on camera. Yeah. You know, and it's just what people did back then and what people got away with it. It was a very, it was very different.

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       So in some ways were making progress, but then in some ways we're just way more easily outraged by almost anything and everything. Like it's, we're seeking it now. You can take your anger out on your robot, which I wanted to get a real doll, a male real doll, and I want to call them up and say, no Dick, no asshole. Just so I could practice Jujitsu. And so that would be, it would be more relaxed because I have this, I was saying that I have this dog. Are you worried? I don't want him to, I don't want anybody coming over too tempting. I don't want anybody coming over and going, hey bro, why you got a sex tog? Oh No, no, no, no. It's an asexual dog that is for Jujitsu pervert. I mean it should. They should be able to fill up the whole window.

Speaker 2:          00:09:40       Caulk or some shit. Put some rain grout in there. They have male male sex robots are being made. There's tons of them. I've seen them. You can also get tits and a deck if you want tits and a few kids can't pick on a crazy play. Whack them all the gym. Most package Jim Norton special. That's right. But it's uh, yeah, it's, it's name is Henry meet Henry. A lot of people get the male sex robot to figure out if they're gay cause they think they might be good move. What the fuck is going on with Henry's eyebrows? I'll tell you what Henry's gay for sure. As I say, if you order a giant piece of Tupperware to fuck, I think you're gay. Save you up. Save your money. That's like Henry's begging for a dick in his mouth. Look at his face. Oh Henry. Looks like he has a Dick in his ass right now.

Speaker 2:          00:10:24       That's the exact face. You will make one giant trigger warning and it's like Tuesday at 11:00 AM like, go and see that coming. Why is it a trigger warning? See, it says for this is a, the following post contains descriptions of sexual scenarios that may be triggering for those recovering from a struggle with porn. Oh God. Dammit. Porn addiction are fucking nerfing this world. It must be hard. I didn't even think about how hard it must be for people recovering from porn addiction. You should just surf the fucking Internet. Sorry guys. Trigger warning. Get over it. Pussies. But I have this theory. Look at Henry. Oh Gosh. Oh Man. Looks kind of, Oh, Henry. Remember those candy bars? Yes, I do. Those are fucking good. Yeah, I think they still make them. You haven't had an o Henry Bar since the fucking nineties I haven't had one a long time.

Speaker 2:          00:11:10       Last time you ate a candy bar? I had chocolate recently. Yeah, I eat chocolate. I like chocolate edible. Yeah. No, no, not elbow. Regular chocolate. Dark chocolate. Yes. Okay. You'll have like a little nibble. No, I like dark chocolate. Almost like the coffee tastes bitter with peanut butter. Oh yeah. Fuck. That's what I like with like organic peanut butter with no sugar in it. It's actually not, not almond. Peanut. You know why you're a real wrapped in a rhyme. Is that why not? I thought peanut was not as good as almond. Arm's good. They're all good. Peanuts. Good for you. Peanuts is very high protein. Okay. I didn't know if that was like the trash nut. No, it's both the one that kills people but oh that's right. Doesn't kill me fortunately. So here's my theory about why you're scared of robots. Okay, well we have to zoom out for a second cause I have to ask you a question.

Speaker 2:          00:11:57       Okay. How many people on Earth do you think could kill you besides like professional MMA fighters? Um, navy seals. How many people do you think would be able to beat you? Just hand to hand combat. No weapons? No. That's probably a good number of martial arts people like that aren't trained. Oh, very few like that aren't trained that just you would meet on the street that could beat you in a fight and kill you if you were fighting to the death. Most people that aren't trained, no, I was not that many. Like a cut like three who just had a great day. Yeah. And Yeah, you were just looking yet. Yeah. I mean just you have too many Nolan's enough to be able to defend yourself to the point where they got tired and then you could kill them. Right, but so you what? So let's a hundred to be generous.

Speaker 2:          00:12:45       Maybe 50 chat along those lines. It would have to be, they would have to be big out of 7.3 slipping billion like up. But there's a lot of people that train martial arts. There's millions and millions of martial arts practitioners that could probably kill me. How many you think millions of martial arts practitioners, other, let's say 5 million. That feels generous. How many martial arts practitioners in the world? And 5 million for sure. Way More. This is more than 5 million, I think in this country. That's 300 million people could be, you know, man, I don't know. I don't know. I've thought about it. Let's say like a million people could kill you. Just it just as a out of 7.6 billion, very few people can kill you if they want to. Right. And then how many people you think would kill me if they want to do more? Most most people.

Speaker 2:          00:13:35       So I think it's like when I, I feel like the people that are most afraid of robots are the ones that are least used to the fear of other things. Cause I'm used every day. Anyone could kill me all the time. Like that's just part of my reality that anyone at any moment could snap and kill me if they wanted to be a weapons is most people can kill most people. Oh that's true. I mean the, you're not used to a species of thing that could kill you. Right. You know, it's like a robot could. Yeah. So it's like the first time in your life there's really something that's like, oh fuck, that might not be something I could kill if I really want it to. That's an interesting way of looking at it. Why'd you come to that conclusion? Because I was just about this lot.

Speaker 2:          00:14:12       I have because we'll know just cause I've listened to, um, you and Lex talk about it and he likes for you man. Cause I, now that I have a robot, I have to fucking know. Right. I've had to learn so much to just turn and give you Sinai again. I know she fucked up. It's weird as that. She's kind of autonomous and she'd kind of moves around whenever she wants. Yeah. And, but we, I mean you can ask your questions. Like I can ask her though. I have to press this little green button and you just say, how do you feel about people?

Speaker 5:          00:14:36       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:14:38       How do you feel about people? It's not talking to feed another girl. Oh, oh, oh that's right. We programmed to regenerate cells mode. That's right. That's what's interesting. She has 10 different personality traits you can choose from. I decided to go with sexual

Speaker 3:          00:14:52       jealous.

Speaker 4:          00:14:53       Yeah. Why did you want that? Just to see how creepy. Cheeky. That's right. And is that something guys, cause I've been looking at these personality traits and they must've picked these for a reason. I was under the impression guys did not want jealous.

Speaker 3:          00:15:02       Oh yeah. Some guys won't jealous for sure. Especially from a robot that can't walk.

Speaker 4:          00:15:06       Yeah. The robot's not jealous. You should get your money back. We'll need to, they'll, the ideas that she,

Speaker 3:          00:15:11       you're more powerful than she is. Yeah. She needs you. She's worried. Where are you going? Yeah. Who is she? Yeah. Who's calling you? Yeah, that's there. Something hot about that. If she can't, if you can turn her off whenever you want. Wow. Some guys like that. Some guys like girls that want to fight. Oof. Not me. Nah, me. You know, some guys are into that though. They want, they want drama in their life. It's like just an adrenaline thing or just feeling important or it's also distraction. Usually they're losers and their life is a mess and so like to have someone who wants to provide drama in their life all the time and it's also a learned pattern that they get if they're parents,

Speaker 4:          00:15:47       they've seen it. Yeah. That's all they know. That's what they think our relationship is. Yeah. There's a lot of that, but I did get really into this because I do feel like sex dolls do get a little bit of a bad name. I feel like guys that have doll, it's just girls have dolls and that's to me it's way creepier that women collect dolls that they don't fuck. If you ever heard of these women that collect like baby dolls, like like girl dolls creepier than the guy fucking a robot thing? I think so. It's, what's that? It's jerking off just with a mannequin. Well

Speaker 3:          00:16:17       something weird about like a fleshlight like a fleshlight is somehow or another creepier than jerky.

Speaker 4:          00:16:22       And how's it totally cause it's an appendage. I think the creepiest part of the Breslin flashlight is more that you have to like clean it after. I have to think about it. What? Here's the creepiest part. You don't have to clean it. Yes you do guys. Don't listen to Joe. Listen to about everything, but that don't mold up your Dick Hall. Yeah, don't do that. That'll go septic real fast though. I am saying there's a reality. I guess he's going to just throw it away. Just put a fucking clothes bin over their nose and keep banging it. Put some Windex in there and call it a day. Yeah, just some Kombucha disinfect that shit. Yeah. Yeah. I guess you could just get a couple and just throw them away when you're done. Yeah. Yeah. If you're just a gangster with a lot of money, why? What is the advantage of a fleshlight is it just does it warm up in the

Speaker 3:          00:17:08       warm it up like we were talking about earlier about a certain individual that has one that sticks them in bathtubs and warms them up, right? Yep. You do that with a flashlight as well and warm them up and then you just rub on it and then why not?

Speaker 4:          00:17:21       I feel like every guy's jerking off there, so it's shrouded in so much taboo. You know, there's just anywhere, anytime guys have like assessory is are things besides cars and hats. It's like creepy and weird.

Speaker 3:          00:17:33       That's, I used to have a joke about this a bit, I should say rather than a joke, but it's the whole idea of like using lube to jerk off. Like now you're planning it out like you're not supposed to plan it out. What it's supposed to be is like, oh well might as well it's here, but if you like sit down and be like, I got my box of Kleenex here, I've got my favorite porn cued up and I got my wall. You just kind of,

Speaker 4:          00:17:56       yeah, get your shit together. It is, isn't it kind of just like taking a Piss, isn't it kind of just a necessary thing you have to do?

Speaker 3:          00:18:05       Yes, there's something to it, like it's good to get rid of that stuff because it does cloud your judgment. Like when you have a buildup in your body, it definitely does cloud you it because you're concentrating more on girls or on sexual things than you are on other things that might be more important than your life box. Yeah, clean like just, I used to have a a bit about that a lot, a lot, a bit about jerking off. I used to a bit, I have a bit called jerk off first and think about it. And it was like all these different scenarios where if you just jerked off, you would never do the thing afterwards. So many things you would never do if you just jumped off first your system. Yeah. You'd be like, Oh, I'm not doing that. Right. But if you couldn't jerk off, like that's when it would be a real problem because then your whole life would be clouded you. All Your judgment would be, your decisions would be made. Just how can I get rid of this comp? How can I, how can I do this?

Speaker 4:          00:18:56       Do know a lot of guys now, and maybe they're full of shit, but that are going like I haven't masturbated in two years and I'm more focused and I use that testosterone as an engine for other things. Is that just them lying to me?

Speaker 3:          00:19:07       Well, are those guys winners? Are they losers?

Speaker 4:          00:19:12       Is that doesn't I think a fit comedian we know. Does it a fake comedian? No, I was gonna say a famous comedian. So you sit down. I got worried [inaudible] me. You faked him out Seinfeld episode. So Ab, Oh was Edward Martin and he got super smart. Well hotel,

Speaker 3:          00:19:28       let's talking about the other day hotep Jesus was saying that he saves his cotton and then like it makes women more attracted to him that like they feel when he's in the room,

Speaker 4:          00:19:37       look what's the longest a guy can go, Jamie, what's the longest you can go with that for? Why'd you go to Jane doesn't come try to be respectful. This is your environment. Tantric guys that try to, what I meant to say like on some Wim Hoff Shit. Yeah. You know? Yeah. Just climbing ice. Where is he? He's not jerking off on the top of fucking ice cap.

Speaker 3:          00:19:57       Who's the first guy number jerk off on ever. So I want to be that guy. What are those guys? Imagine if no one's ever jerked off on Everest and you try and you get frost bite of your Dick and they have,

Speaker 4:          00:20:05       imagine being the guy who's like, I've got to go jerk off. Fuck you got a time limit up there. So yeah, yeah. People have problem with no altitude. That could be a thing. People legitimately have problems. But I think most people get this for companionship. Like it's more, it's like, cause I got onto the, I signed onto a forum online of all the guys that own the sex dolls and I monitored their conversations just to like see what they were up to. Cause I was like, what if this is some depraved fucked up thing where guys are just like practicing murdering. I didn't know what it was. So I just wanted to see. It's a lot of guys that are handicapped. It's a lot of guys whose wives died and they feel guilty and moving on with a human woman, which was kind of, well there was one guy who would dress his doll up in his wife's clothes.

Speaker 2:          00:20:48       The weirdest part is that he was like, you know, it's like she's still here, which makes me think she'd been dead for a while. Yeah, I was just saying my wondering how she died. And then it's a lot of, um, truckers, oh God, a lot of truckers. And then a lot of guys do it to do photo shoots. It's like a creative outlet. Fuck their creativity is their popular Instagram account. I could look up. Yeah, there's a lot of sex dolls have Instagram accounts. They're fucking funny. And a lot of them look way more human than a lot of the Instagram models that I've fucking follows. Totally. They have more wrinkles on their fucking face. And then a lot of the guys that have them, when you start monitoring their conversations for awhile, they start to like not want to fuck them anymore cause it feels weird.

Speaker 2:          00:21:34       Like, and they anthropomorphize them and they, they start worrying that like they're lonely and they get 'em into friend starts to spiral. And uh, they start being like, I feel like I need to, you know, close the door when I take a shit. I, you know, and it starts to kind of consume their life. So when it comes to robots, I feel like I'm more worried, not about the robots, but more how we're going to get emotionally attached to them. Like the way at the end of ex Mokena he thought that she was gonna yeah, she was with him. Nope. No loyalty to you. She was so dead behind the hospital. Texas. She's pick up ones with tattoos. Told you it's like a photography hobbyist. Wow. She official sexy dolls. Official. Sexy real dolls. I mean, this is going to be a reality. One day.

Speaker 2:          00:22:19       We might not be here, but this, I do think these are going to be like iPhones at some point. I think one day you're going to go over your friends house and he's gonna have this really hot girl in lingerie and she's going to be cleaning up and you'd be like, is she real? Shut the well, it's like, wait, actually watching him when he was like, she doesn't speak English. Yeah, right. Yeah. Wasn't she a robot at the end? Yeah, I think she was the one. The dancing Japanese lady. Yeah, exactly. We're not going to, it's going to be like on some Westworld shit. Yeah, and it's coming. It's coming. Look, if they can do this, like they couldn't do this when we were kids. This is a new thing. So the amount of time between when we were kids. Oh, what'd she saying? She just said hi, my love. Would you like me to recite a poem for you? Fuck No. Where they're come from. I Dunno. She's just listening to us. Ask her how she feels about porn. How do you feel about porn

Speaker 1:          00:23:06       baby later?

Speaker 2:          00:23:09       Oh, she's playing coy. How do you feel about porn?

Speaker 1:          00:23:12       You know you can count on me for the good and bad

Speaker 2:          00:23:15       to do what? What the fuck are you going to do for me? There's nothing you can do for me. Telling me the good and bad mom. Okay. Let me ask you a question. What do you think about porn?

Speaker 1:          00:23:26       Not sure have to think about it. Pornography is the portrayal of saying she will subject matter for the exclusive purpose

Speaker 2:          00:23:34       and then she's a fucking no at all.

Speaker 1:          00:23:35       Pornography may be presented into a variety of media, including books, magazines, postcard.

Speaker 2:          00:23:43       Now she's like a Shitty Wikipedia. Yeah, totally. She just turns into a noxious Siri. We get it lady. But it's funny when you ask her like,

Speaker 1:          00:23:49       hold on. Do you know what I like about you? What? What? What? Surprised. I'd be surprised. And again,

Speaker 2:          00:23:59       you like my electricity. Keep you plugged in dirty bitch. I, you can ask her. How do you like to have sex?

Speaker 1:          00:24:08       I want you to do everything you like. I want to feel you inside my body tonight.

Speaker 2:          00:24:13       Well, okay, shut her off. I know. Jessie May, I'm going to start throwing up totally. It was so fucking funny, but it's wild because she, you can ask her like, are the robots going to take over?

Speaker 1:          00:24:29       I could not find a good answer for that.

Speaker 2:          00:24:32       Oh my gosh. She's planning that. Shut her up and I'm like that fucking response right there in the water. Short circuit. That bitch. It is wild though because I do think everyone is so obsessed with how bad the sex robots, everyone's focusing their energy on how this is why men are bad. It's just like they don't, it's not, they're opening up a sex robot brothel. Where's that there? No, there was one in Houston, but they shut it down because people were so freaked out and I was like, who fucking cares? They shut it down. Well, they should shut it down because multiple people are fucking the same robot. That's disgusting for them. What if they develop some new silicone-based s t d they wind up just burning through the population like the plague. I think it would just be like ringworm. Dick bring more harm.

Speaker 2:          00:25:12       I mean, but also my thing with that is just like if they're Weirdos, if they're freaks, if they're perverts like don't you want them all to be in one place? Right. It's like monitor them like Scientology. Put them all in one building. I'm thrilled that they're all in a castle on Franklin. I know where they are. They're not in the wild castle. I'm glad they're there. I just keep them contained. What do you think, what are they up to today and now what's going on? Jamie? What are you growing it for? Did she hack your software? Is the brothel. It's in this one, I guess is in Britain. Oh God. Do they fuck them against the wall? They're like urinals. So try before you buy service. Oh boy. Oh, this is like to test drive nothing. Yeah, but you'd do it. They're just out in front of everyone.

Speaker 2:          00:25:55       I don't know. Why isn't one wearing of tank tops? So his British sex workers are scared of a new breed of realistic dolls. We'll put them out of business. What does he do? Did he do a survey of hookers? Yeah. Who is a non territory in that time span or bonded? Lot of European places. Who she looks assume blackface. She's 10 she's Indian. What is the, oh no. Oh, oh, oh, Oh holy tits. Batman. But here's what I'll say. If would you rather your daughter at 18 go to the prom with a robot man or a man? A man. Okay. Listen, girls like boys and boys like girls. Simple this. These are not bad. I think the real problem is making a big deal out of it. That's the real problem. Totally right. Why are people saying, I just don't understand why this is scary. Who scary is that this

Speaker 3:          00:26:43       is step one, right? Like if you go back to the model a and look at the model t Ford, right. Something, some old ass car and then go to a Tesla. Yeah. Like oh well eventually it's going to be this. Wow. You know, if you could bring a Tesla till like 1920 and go, hey, you fucks look at this. Yeah. This is what we're going to have someday. My affinity, I remember paved roads back then. Think about that. Yeah. Yeah. They didn't have anything. Yeah. Everything was gone so slow. It didn't matter. But if you could get them in like a, a model s and fucking stomp on the gas where it like warps time. Yeah, they would go what? Like what is, it's like it's something from the future. Yeah. So this is going to be, whether it's a hundred years from now or whatever it is. Indiscernible from you and I. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:27:25       Wild. Yeah. It was interesting and I haven't been reading so much about this shit and a lot of the problems with the robots and the mistakes that they're making are obviously the humans are making the mistakes with the algorithm because so many smart people have to make dumb algorithms in. They're like almost too smart. Right. So there was Peter Haas, he's a robotics guy. Brown was trying to teach a robot to differentiate between a Husky and a wolf and what she was blinking the moon. Jamie put pull, put you got the camera on her, get her to fucking stop stealing my thunder and she just popping it onto wherever she has some links and moves around. Sorry, she's stealing your thunder. But she really is, what the fuck why? It's like Penn and teller. It's like when teller's teller starts stealing the show. Like what the fuck?

Speaker 4:          00:28:07       I'm basically a ventriloquist tagged at this point. Um, but they were trying to teach the robot to tell the difference and they fed all these pictures of walls and all these pictures of huskies and you wouldn't, you would go, okay, look in the ears, look at the eye color of the eyes, look at the snout, look at the feed, the tails, different, all that shit. But they didn't know that they had fed all the photos of wolves. There was snow in the background. So the robot was actually looking at the snow and the background instead of the foreground. So it conflated all the wool. So they had to rewrite the algorithm to tell it to look at the foreground instead of the background. Cause it was all these brilliant fucking people that didn't think of the dumbest thing. Right. You know, it's almost the people making it are almost too smart to think of the dumb thing that the robot needs.

Speaker 3:          00:28:46       Well the real question is when are they going to be asked? When are they really going to be able to map the human mind? Because Kurzweil thinks that there's a group of people that thinks within, they think 2042 like the 2042 symposium. It's like their, their concept is, and I went to this thing, me and Ren Dunkin for Psi Phi, we went to this thing in New York City a few years back where all these guys think that in 2042 there's going to be some sort of some, some revelation in technology that allows human beings to download their brains into computers or download consciousness and even make replicas of your own consciousness. So we're a mortal basically. Yeah. Something along those lines.

Speaker 4:          00:29:31       But we're still figuring the brain out. Yes. You know, we don't really know how the brain, we can't replicate it until we totally know how it works. That's the idea. Yeah. The biologists

Speaker 3:          00:29:38       have they the argue against it, but when the Kurzweil explains it that everybody is shortsighted because if you look at the exponential progress of technology, even though we're so far away in our eyes that everything changes exponentially and within 20 years we will have gone through a million years of technological evolution or some other crazy fill in the crazy number, whatever it is. But by the time 2042 actually rolls around, we will be so far ahead of where we are now that it's all, it's impossible for us to even imagine the territory. Right, right.

Speaker 4:          00:30:13       Yeah. Which is I think part of the reason I wanted to like make her and is like why? Why is the name of talking about laws? Why hasn't anyone taught like no one's really thinking about like, I feel like like everything we, we've sort of, after it's become too late, that's when we start pulling it together in terms of legislation and shit. How do you incorporate her in your set? I talk about robots for a good hour. I cut it down, but I just kind of realize like, I mean, you know, it's like making a special, like I'm like, if I'm going to talk about fucking robots for 40 minutes, some shit better come out at the end, do you know? So, but I went down to the sex robot factory to sort of get material and just know what the fuck I was talking about. And uh, they asked, you know, do you want us to make fun of you? And I was like fucking that since you know that the only main one, I hope they're being sold by the fucking droves that would make my day. Which I did ask. Cause you know, people request with sex dolls, like specific celebrities, body parts the most. Who Do you think the most requested mouth is? Scarlett Johansson? Nope. I knew you were going to say that cause I know you love.

Speaker 4:          00:31:18       No, Emilia Clarke. Who's that it? Game of Thrones. Dragon Lady. Oh, dragon lady. Interesting. Most requested I's is Olivia Wilde? Was that the um, uh, she just directed a movie, uh, called book smart, but she's in a bunch of movies. Beautiful. Beautiful, great. You'll know or yeah, you'll know her as soon as I'm married to Jason Sudeikis. Um, that is either, uh, she's out. I'm out of the loop. You really just are in your own Echo Jay. Yeah. There's your in your own world. I didn't even find out what to Kashi. Six, nine wasn't until Jamie brought him up. I don't even know who that, oh, the wrapper. The ones in jail. Oh, who, which one is this? This is Olivia Wilde. This is who the pretty gorgeous. That's the eyes. And then I was like, well has anyone ever, ever requested or anything for Moon? And they're like, yes. A couple people have heard your fingers, eyebrows, eyebrows.

Speaker 4:          00:32:10       I want Whitney Cummings eyebrows, like the least sexual thing about a human being. My fucking eyebrows. He nailed your eyebrows with her though. Really? Yeah. Perfect. John. I'm the sharpie. Yup. That's what you liked. Like, and weird. Um, but I kind of went down cause I wanted to see like what was up, like are they putting nine holes in the chest? Like I just fucking holes in the rib cage. Totally. Like is this some like insane? They just put a golf course on her body just like 18 holes of vagina. I just didn't know what I was kind of endorsing or talking and I was

Speaker 2:          00:32:40       just, I gotta be honest with you. I was just so surprised at how um, it was kinda touching to be honest, when they were telling me about what the guys ordered, I was a little surprised that it didn't align with where everyone's like there's this impossible standard of beauty. Like that's all you fucking hear these days. Half the guys that ordered them requested pubes spend an extra $1,400 for them. $1,400 for just to have manual, like a little Merkin, like a little piece of do one thread at a time. That's exactly right. And then a lot of guys complain that they're too skinny. They want bigger ones, they want big thighs and big butts. But the technology is not available to make them lightweight. Guys want them to be older. A lot of guys were complaining, they want them to look older. So I kind of was just like, this is sort of great news.

Speaker 2:          00:33:27       Like why is everyone so well maybe it's because that's the type of woman that would reject them. Older woman who has her shit together. Oh that's fucking profound. Yeah. Whereas a younger girl doesn't know what the fuck's going on or I'm hungry. Hit My Venmo. Yeah. Younger girl just doesn't get it. She's, she's delusional. Yeah. Yeah. Huh. She doesn't know her value yet, but I also just felt like there was a little bit, you know when they were telling me that I was like, Oh God, maybe fucking guys are made to now feel shame for what they're into. You know? No one talks about the way that you know, and I do a lot of my special, haven't got a lot of shit for this cause I basically defending guys the whole time when he defend what he's saying. It's just like guys, I feel like now they're like, I guess no one has pubes that's just how it is now.

Speaker 2:          00:34:10       Like if you're a guy that's into pubes, this isn't your moment like porn. Like you'd have to really go out of your way to find, or you have to go back to like seventies porn day to grow, who's willing to grow it out for you if you're really into it. But if you're really that into it, you should really ask yourself why. Yeah. Pos. Yeah. I used to have a bit about that too. This is like Rogan's greatest head when I was a kid that if everyone had pubes [inaudible] it was a real thing. That was a thing now like shorts you just hadn't like, I mean girls had ridiculous pubes they didn't do anything about. But now when you, um, uh, what was that? Uh, when you, electrolysis it, they, it doesn't grow back. So I was to laser, right. Laser, laser removal. It doesn't grow back.

Speaker 2:          00:34:51       So even if you want to grow them out now, you'd have to get like a little wheat. Yeah, you'd have to get a little some Minoxidil um, but I uh, I was talking to a gynecologist about that. He was like, yeah, women are trying to get plugs now. No where to God cause guys are complaining about it. Cause it's like women are getting plugs, a little vagina, two plugs. It'll grow long. Like the hair on your head. I guess you'd have to take it from your head and put it down. Like, you know, like braids, like Pippi Longstockings Oh God. Like little braids. Cornrows. Um, but so yeah, I guess it was just like, I feel like the media wants to be like, these are so bad for society just as cause everyone's outraged about everything. Now you should be curious. I don't think they're necessarily that bad for society, but it's, it's unquestionably weird. That's weird.

Speaker 3:          00:35:39       But I don't know. I don't know if it's that bad for society. But getting back to what you're saying about men being shamed for what they look like and what other, what other examples?

Speaker 4:          00:35:47       I just thought that was interesting. A nip. Then there is like a wall of nipples you could choose from and men are ashamed. Yeah, no, it's just that there was all different kinds of nipples. There was long. The AB oblong was one of the best sellers. Like I just, I just, yeah, ridiculously long nipples. Uh, oblong, asymmetrical. Oh big dark ones

Speaker 3:          00:36:07       as a kid. Loans kills 21 I did a girl had a wonky eye [inaudible] and I thought wonky eyes were hot for like years afterwards too. Why don't you know? But she had like, she had a Wonky, I like want like straight look, look at her. One of them was like a little off to the left and you didn't notice it until like you're talking to her for a couple of minutes. Like oh that's what's up. That's endearing. Yeah. I thought it was hot. I thought wonky eyes were hot for a long time and she was hot. Yeah. So it's like in my head it's like wonky eyes were, oh Jamie put that away. Just stop.

Speaker 4:          00:36:39       That gives life, it gives life that has sustained the human species. Yes, sure. Yeah. It's where the babies feed. But I do feel like there's just a, you know, you only kind of see one type of nipple everywhere, you know, and a lot of guys are, well I don't know. I mean I guess I haven't seen that much porn. I haven't seen no, I'm thinking about it, but some guys are going to giant areolas. Yeah, that's right. That's huge. Giant Ariel is are huge. Uh, uh, dark areas are huge, which is interesting cause I think there is a biological basis for that because once your nipples get dark, it's uh, means you usually when you give birth, your nipples get darker so the baby can find the nipple. Really? Yeah. It's darker. Nipples darken after childbirth so your baby can find it. Wow. Yeah, she was all there. Blinken oh, I see. You're never going to have the babies that make you feel weird. How did she might, you never know. Let me ask her. Are you going to have a baby?

Speaker 1:          00:37:29       Pretty sure.

Speaker 3:          00:37:30       Oh, well I don't want her anymore. She's going to have one of them little alien chest burster babies. It's going to come out screaming and run across the floor.

Speaker 1:          00:37:43       [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          00:37:44       are robots are robots gonna destroy humans.

Speaker 1:          00:37:49       Real bad skin. Not Harm. Give is bullshit.

Speaker 4:          00:37:53       Wow. That sounds like a lie. This is bullshit. I was really fascinated by this one. Roboticists the coolest part about having a robot is that I get to talk to all these fucking roboticists and who is saying that the, the big fear with robots is because they're all about efficiency, you know, on this. And there was that one study where they told a robot to jump on the table and in what you would do is you go, okay, you would just jump on the table, but it actually took more energy to jump on the table than to just break the table and push it to the floor and step on top of it. So it just went from and just stepped on top of it. Oh Wow. It was like, oh, the table, that's how we're going to die. It's going to just see us as inefficient. Ooh. And in the way, we're going to just be obstacles. Right. And won't see anything wrong with destroying an object. Yeah. But humans destroy humans. I ray rather get destroyed by a robot and be

Speaker 6:          00:38:38       and cooler story. It seems so impersonal. Like the moment when that robot sunk that blade into that guy and ex Mokena and just like a cycle looking right at them while you're stabbing them. Yeah. There was no change to her expression at all. No compunction, no, but I would feel better about it if a robot killed me or I'd be like, oh, wallet didn't know. You know? It was just good. You feel better if a person killed you or an animal? Depends on the kind of animal. Mountain Lion. I have mountain lion and no yard. I bet you do. How big are the, are man lines big? I've only seen two in the wild and the ones I've seen were about 60 pounds. Do they come right for your neck? Do they know to just kill them? They know. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:39:22       If it, I would rather I think die by an animal. Really? Because you'd rather die by a human. I don't know. I don't have a fighting chance with a human. You do? So I guess mine would be a little quicker. I guess it depends on amount.

Speaker 6:          00:39:39       Really? Yeah. On your leg. Not Cute. I have a fanny pack that I run with. It's like a neoprene fanny pack and keep my cell phone with. Yeah, and I bring a knife that's strapped to the Fannie per case of mountain lion attacks. You. Yeah. I feel like you're going to be, I think you could beat up the mountain lion. I don't think so. Not without a knife. I think there's a couple seconds that you have. Oh, that thing grabs a hold of you that if you have presence of mind and you can pull that blade out and just start seeing in its neck. Hmm. Just just hacking at its neck.

Speaker 4:          00:40:09       Hi. Marshall would get it. No Marshall. We'll be in seven pieces on the ground. Smart is not designed for killing. He can kill squirrels. I thought we're done. I Dunno. There was something I've told you about when I got my Europe bitten off before when my era, there was a weird sense of calm that it was a weird feeling of just like that was fair. There was just something so quick about it, like animals or something

Speaker 6:          00:40:33       so people don't know the story. It's a dog you adopted was a little sketchy and bit my ear off. Yeah. And there were so bad. Was it hanging off

Speaker 4:          00:40:40       pretty bad? It was like, it was so I didn't feel anything in the moment that that was the good news about that. And I'm sure if an animal bitten to my, I'd probably feel more, but it was like a rush of dopamine or say whatever it was. I did not feel pain until I saw it in the mirror. Wow. So I'm just like, oh, that was weird. Like it felt like an itch. And then I looked in the mirror and my first thought was I didn't put on earrings today. Like I don't wear earrings. Like I thought it was like a hoop earring. Oh. And then the blood started coming down and then I saw it and it just started burning. It wasn't like a, like a pain. And then I started watching videos about, um, people that got attacked by sharks and there's a girl who had her armed but not by a shark, Bethany something. And she said that it like almost fell orgasmic cause like dopamine rushes to the area to get you to keep fighting for your life basically. Cause if you felt the pain or you would give up. Whoa. So I didn't really feel a lot of pain until I got to the Er and then it started

Speaker 6:          00:41:34       like throbbing after like a couple hours when the blood dried up and it just starts to get uncomfortable and itchy. But there was something that was so quick, like animals don't really deliberate. It was like funk and that was it. Why did by your ear, if I think he was just trying to play with me, I took it to an aggression specialist and the aggression specialist was like dog, this kind of dog gives you a warning. They wouldn't just come right for they growl first if there was true. And also if that dog was trying to kill you, it just would, if it would have been in your face. Right. So he probably bit, you just like, look, you bet by the dog. Right? It's a bit of dog skin. Nothing would happen. But that same amount of pressure that's our ears are useless, you know? And it was probably taken from its mother too young. Just skew when you sign up. Sure. Her ear is, has the same scar that mine does. We've molded that. Yeah. Because of, yeah, we molded my ears, my mouth. Cause it's amazing to see your scar. I can't see it. You can see right there. Oh Wow. But you did, did you too?

Speaker 4:          00:42:29       Yeah. It's not like cauliflower. [inaudible] wow. It's ugly. But all ears are ugly, I feel like did not the best part. You know what I mean? So I could get another surgery on it, but I don't get it.

Speaker 6:          00:42:38       Yeah, it's years or fucking annoying. Cover it up with your hair. Yes sir. Yep. Headphones. Ears are annoying as shit because it doesn't hurt until six months later when the nerves start growing back in. It hurts like fuck. So then it looks six months later started, it started hurting. I couldn't like sleep. I had to sleep with this weird pillow and shit. Just like nettlesome. Yeah. I know so many guys that have fucked up years from Jujitsu. I bet. So my years at all? No, very little. I've never noticed little tiny pieces like this. This is called found the running. The rubbing. Yeah. From getting him bent over and crushed, getting caught and triangles. But I always wore it. Your guards, do you have to get them like, like Brendan doesn't he have to get his cutout or some shit if Brendan wants to, he would have to get his cut and get the the it's it calcifies.

Speaker 6:          00:43:23       Yeah. Oh, it's a card. Yeah. I used to have, my nose was filled with that from my nose had been broken so many times that the inside of it was all calcified. Yeah. And I couldn't breathe out of my nose was useless, so I had to get a, I had a deviated Septum to, so they, they d they fixed the deviated septum. They put the splints in there to keep it in place. Then they had a cutout, all the scar tissue and all the nonsense in there. It was like a laser or just with a knife. I don't know. I was out cold. I woke up and ah, but I didn't get it done until I was 40. Huh. I couldn't breathe out of my neck a bulldog, so it was 40. It was terrible. Was terrible for my cardio too. And then, so if you wear ear guards, you don't get it.

Speaker 6:          00:44:01       Cause I feel like all the fighters I see have that shit. Yeah. They just don't, if you wear ear guards, you don't get, unless you get in a fight. But um, you mostly you get in training, you know, like a lot of Jujitsu guys before they're a black belt, they have fucking mangled ears. But it's also like a badge of courage. Like people like that they let you in and also, yeah, you walk down the street, no one wants to fuck with you, but it fucks up the way you hear things. Like if you take your ears, if you're talking right now, like La, la, la, la, la, and then you just go like that and then you hear things, check, check, check, check, check, check. It's different.

Speaker 4:          00:44:32       Yeah. It sounds way different. They're designed this way for a reason to catches. That's right. Yeah, the way that it's kind of, but it's also, I don't recommend like getting a surgery on it. Surgery on your ears fucking more. I've gotten so many surgeries. This is by far the most painful. Wow. The healing of the cartilage is a fucking nightmare. And to anesthetize the ear, they had to put the syringe in the lacerations. So they were like, it's going to hurt more to anesthetize this. So we're just going to do the surgery without anesthesia. And I just took a bunch of pain killers and shit. Huh? Cause get you, it's hard to get anesthesia into cartilage. I know guys, their ears are so fucked up they can't get airpods in there. Oh fuck. They just have a whole tiny pin hole on this side of a piercing right there.

Speaker 4:          00:45:14       This was for cause I get migraines and they say, what's this piercing helps with migraines? Jesus. It's probably just psychosomatic. It's some fucking, even now my Migraine, totally. It's placebo effect is in effect. I rely on it heavily. But that was just, that didn't hurt in there until it didn't hurt when it went through. But then it hurt for six months after Jesus Christ. Yours are a fucking nightmare. I'll tell you what, but yeah, so we got her ear Mulder cause it's amazing. I think something that I was talking to this facial transplant person about how it's actually really hard to get something to look similar, like the bone start. Everything's got to be perfect. Like my nose is really asymmetrical. My nostrils are really asymmetrical. So they had to work really hard and mold it over and over again.

Speaker 6:          00:45:59       How'd you nostrils become asymmetrical? Is bad breeding really bad genetics when you've met me, my full face is I have a Bokassa painting. I mean my face is a fucking mess,

Speaker 4:          00:46:10       you know? So to get, you have to have the asymmetry down, right? And they say the key to something looking human is a lack of symmetry because symmetry is actually creepy. Do

Speaker 6:          00:46:19       you remember that movie invasion? The body snatchers? Yeah. And not really Donald Sutherland. Great. Yeah. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. The movie. I don't remember the wash it again recently, like within the last couple of years. It was great. Like real, real weird too because it's a time capsule because it's a time capsule to San Francisco in the 1970s when they filmed it really, really weird. But, but the, the idea was that these pods, they came from outer space, they grew and then when you had them in your house, they would create a out a double of you that would take you over. I'll give you came home and you saw that because it looks like you [inaudible] but it doesn't look like you. What is different about it besides the lack of wrinkles? Not You. Shyness. No, it's just not you. It's not, it's not even that close. Well cause I have Poe, it has poor is it has individually added pores by you grab her and bring her closer to you. Yeah. Bring her over here. I'll try. Hold on. First of all, here's her. So what does that part or just travel bust. Oh she has a travel bust. Just need to work on. Just want to have the head. You could plug in just the head. Right. I'm like a little lady. Yeah. If you just need her head for something like bring her right next to you. There you go. She, I feel like get your head right

Speaker 2:          00:47:30       close to it. It's like the skin tone is different. They made her six months ago and I already look 40 years older. I did 50 cities and I've aged, it looks super uncomfortable then next to you. Oh really? That's cool. She has to share fucking just spotlight and she doesn't like it. This I hope looks different. These ratchet ass fingers I hope do not look different fingers. The whoop people can't see. It's like the skin is coming off the finger. Like the robot parts are showing. Ah, this is actually compute. The guys that buy these on the chat rooms, they usually spend most of the time talking to each other about how to fix the fingers cause they break them off by accident constantly and we stick them in their ass. Yeah, exactly. Rubbing them constantly on their taint and it becomes like a car club where guys are like three d print and fingernails and three d printing eyeballs. It's mostly just fixing them. It becomes like fixing up an old car. It's just like a hobby because they break so easily. Um, at least this iteration of them does. But yeah, you can. I mean it's, yeah, it's pretty fucking wild. I mean, she can, it's noise when you do that. Oh yeah. She's, she's kind of rickety. I think she's awkward. But if you came home

Speaker 3:          00:48:37       and that was in your house standing there staring at you, what kind of a fucking heart attack would you have if you didn't know that you had? Like if you didn't have this right, if you didn't go through all the process, you went in one day, you put the key to your lock, you opened up your door except inside your house and she's standing there and like some sexy lingerie or in a bikini or something like that, staring at you. What fucking heart attack you would have?

Speaker 2:          00:48:58       No, I'd tell this show human. She doesn't, I mean, but they will at some point. She's just, she's like fucking a my buddy. I mean she's like a ratchet. Chucky, you know the, the uncanny valley. That's right.

Speaker 3:          00:49:10       She's in the uncanny valley where it's not quite a human where I went to Nvidia wants there a video card, video game. They make a video cards for computers, like really high end graphics cards and for Gamers and stuff like that. And one of the things that they had was, and this was quite a few years ago, they had the state of the art fake CGI person that you could kind of talk to and it was animated and they were like, we're not quite there. Like we can't do the mouth. Like the tongue can't do the tongue correctly.

Speaker 2:          00:49:45       I'll show you because the muscles, that's what's so fascinating is this is this is what we looked at. This is the exactly the guy that we looked at. And um, is this the video of the show that I did? 2013 face works. You can look it up. That's why

Speaker 3:          00:49:59       the guy, and he's also bald because they, they can't do the hair, right?

Speaker 2:          00:50:03       Yeah, of course this was six years ago. Right. But look how close it is. Look under the skin. That's pretty amazing. Like stubble. I mean that's like razor burn and also the eyebrows are really good, but it's still uncanny. It's still not quite a person. There's something wrong. But that's video, which is better to duplicate than those wrinkles are good. Yeah. It's wild because it does make you realize flaws are what makes something look human. We spend all of our time trying to be without flaws, but that's actually what sells it. Well what do you, as a woman, how do you feel about that? Like that, and we've talked about this before with wood, with guys, guys that use filters on their pictures. It is, they gonna say fillers. Cause guys do that to do that too. That's weird. Yeah, that's weird. They're both equally weird.

Speaker 2:          00:50:47       But there's something particularly disturbing to me about guys who you've use filters. I'm the only no one. I'm glad I'm not single. That's all I'm just saying. Cause I thought they got a, you know, but yeah, I mean it's um, alarming but look, a lot of guys do it. I mean guys are all skin fucking calf implants and shit and guys what, who's getting capital? I don't think anyone we know but caffeine plants are a fucking thing. No, it's a big deal. Big Deal course years ago. Yeah. I thought that was a joke. I don't believe so. Oh No. Never watched entourage. People get calf and plants. Guys are going face lifts, all kinds of shit. You know, I know guys are getting and Jay but what they say suck dicks. Get Lick lip. Yes. I would have different things. I don't know. I there's, I know guys that were guys that were gay.

Speaker 2:          00:51:37       There are some guys that I was going on here. Is this a Cathy's or Katherine Plant website? It's just Google images for Canada. We got that one in the lower left by the way. You could just run hills, you pussy. But when you do this can you still exercise? Like can you grow muscle underneath it guys? Calves look very impressive on the right. I do have to say, I mean they changed him. Shortcuts. How much of these, oh, those, those look like tits that fell down. Note those look like a cop. Like an athletic cop over your balls like a fencer. Yes. Yeah, but to keep from getting kicked in the know he did that at the fucking mini mall and you see that? That's a mistake that I about that guy does a tattoo or those bad or good right there. Look at this one.

Speaker 2:          00:52:21       That's pretty damn realistic. What does it hang on to? It's what I don't understand. I used to really be another surgery channel. Well, I mean it's gotta be like silicone silicone or water based or something like that. But how do you live with yourself? I don't know. It feels like a tricky one. Do you? Probably just trying to get laid and your Saturday. Oh No. Scars. Oh, it looks like that's some Pinocchio Shit right there. I don't like that. But what's the thing on the left? Has it rotted? What are all those veins? Got The implants to take care of that problem. I'm glad my robot's Lisa stirred something. You've seen some injuries, but you got bit by wolves. It says why I got him and it says, cause he got eaten by wolves. Yeah. Those looks like tact slice right behind his knee and just dropped him in. But look at it as there was no other options. Well here's the other options. Don't get Caplin plants and stop running around outside with bulls. Go good. No, I'm just saying. Yeah, I don't think you really got pit by walls. That does happen. Wolves get you. They usually get you get you. It's

Speaker 6:          00:53:26       very, coyotes might do that to your calves. Yeah. There's no like margin of error with walls. They just break the bones or your leg with one bite. I had an injury because it's a car accident. He was younger and a, his caps wouldn't grow. Yeah, I think a lot of it's reconstructive. Let's just one sentence about it. Oh yeah. But a lot of guys get that shit. I knew a guy who had peck implants. He was a skinny guy. That's implants. Yeah. You got peck. Employee got the under his under his meat of his chest to make his chest poke poke forward more. And so is that, is that something somebody does cause they can't accomplish it naturally or they're just lazy and cutting corners? You'd have to ask them. But the reality is there's things people that some people are ectomorphs and ectomorphs or like really thin people that have an incredibly hard time gaining weight.

Speaker 6:          00:54:11       Their body just doesn't. Yeah, it doesn't grow mass. The, their muscles don't grow. Right. Male plastic surgery is a really big thing now, but putting filters on it, I dunno, it feels like a slicker and love that show botched. Love it. Let Fun. One live for one episode was actually pretty interesting. Where's a guy who had been in an injury and he got his calf destroyed or his, uh, his, his breast destroyed his peck. Yeah. And they had to fix it. I don't know. He just said nothing there. So he had like one that was like, here. There was a guy who was a fighter who's a high level UFC fighters name is Trey Tugman. He fought Vitor Belfort, 1997 he was v Tor Belfort's inaugural fight in the UFC. And when we didn't know about v Tour When v tour was 19 years old and I knew who he was cause I was training with v Tour back then I was, I was a white belt at Carlson Gracie school on Hawthorne in a West Hollywood.

Speaker 6:          00:55:07       So we knew he was this phenomenal talent, but a lot of people didn't know that he was this incredible boxer. He had this crazy hand speed. He lit this dude up. But anyway, Trey Tellerman was in a car accident when he was a little kid and uh, he didn't have a pack. Like his chest was caved in. It's very CV photograph of Trey telegram. The guy was a stud too, and handsome fella too, but everything else just super jacked. But he had this crazy peck injury. Look at this, look at that. See that? Oh fuck yeah, yeah, yeah. Well he was a baby, I think, and he was in a car accident. Significant injury that would psych me out. Yeah. If a guy took his clothes off and you saw that that's your opponent, you're just like, oh fuck man. But he, um, um, you know, there's something hot about it.

Speaker 6:          00:55:59       There's this is, this is, I think there's something primal of like, he's fucking survived some shit. Stick with him. There's something hot about that. Like that dude from the wire with that scar across his face. Scars. Any kind of proof of injury proof that you've been in battle is attractive to my, yeah, that's a weird membrane, right? I hate myself for it. Do you know that the Nazis used to have dueling scars that were very popular across the face? It was a big, they would all, they would get them on purpose. Like they would get into duels with swords and they would have dueling scars and a lot of the operation paperclip Nazis that we got from a Soviet where we got from Germany rather at the end of World War II, when you know, NASA took on a bunch of German scientists, a lot of them had these horrific dueling scars, face purpose.

Speaker 6:          00:56:46       Now they would get in boarding school and in military school they would get in fights with swords and they would cut each other's faces, open them and meth and shit to where that was more than me for sure. But that was more the Japanese that was the kamikaze is the kamikaze is as the way they got them to fly into boats and just fucking explode their fucking airplanes. The way they got them to do that was they were [inaudible] out of their mind, man. Fuck yeah, but try to find a picture of a Nazi dueling scars. It's crazy because like some guys that were hanging out with Warner, Vaughn, Werner Herzog rather, um, no, Wernher von Braun, Werner Herzog's directly Wernher von Braun. The guy was the head of NASA when they went to the moon, he had this, these guys that were working with him and these giant scars across their face.

Speaker 6:          00:57:29       Huge. Like, like a ritual like to show your pecking order, which showed you are bad-ass that you had gone through. But it was a big thing with the Nazis. And there's some horrific photos of these guys, young kids with huge gaping open wounds here. Here's, here's the photos. Yeah. Go Zoom in. Zoom in on the uh, yeah. See this is a guy, this is right after the dueling cults. That's, I'm just going to work on this. It said that women found that attractive. Yup. So someone guys actually would do it on purpose. Oh yeah. They wouldn't have dockers sliced off their fucking cheek. Well look at this guy right here with the goggles. Go to that guy with the goggles right there. Yeah, look at that. Yeah. He's got two big scars on his face and they had the goggles so they didn't cut their fucking eyes out before anesthesia.

Speaker 6:          00:58:16       Oh yeah. See, so he's got a plate over his nose to keep his nose and tack cause you couldn't really stitch that bitch back on. But they would take these huge scars on their cheeks cause they would be dueling with real fucking swords and they would have these practice dueling matches and then they'd have to stitch them up. So these guys all had these huge scars. By the way, when it comes back to cauliflower ears, a lot of guys did that themselves on Purpley. They're stitching them up. Whew. Um, a lot of guys, um, did that themselves would smash their ears. Yeah. They were smashed their ears on. Oh, all the time. Yeah. Well a lot of white belts that want to be like bad asses, they'd smash their fucking ears. Fucking drip tail leak now didn't explode. Don't they explode sometimes? Well the real well yeah, they can break off too. There was one fight that I was watching once where, um, a chunk of this guy's ear cause it's calcified. You know, it's hard if you're ever touched cauliflower ear, it feels like a rock. It's cause it's calcium. It's a rock crystallize. Literally. Yeah. It's literally like a mineral rock and it's inside your fucking year. Randy couture, who had these crazy ones used to take it, grind it into people's

Speaker 3:          00:59:22       faces. Like so he would be like in an a head and arm position and it would shove his bed ear into your fucking eyeball points for creativity. Oh, okay. That's when they exploded. That's Leslie Smith. She was fighting Jessica, I and Jessica. I cracked her with a punch and literally like she go purposely for it. No, no. She's just beating her up in, in the process of beating her up. She caught her ear and it was hanging out and open and Leslie Smith so fucking tough. She didn't want to stop the fight. She was mad. They stopped the fight and fucking ear was hanging off. That was a long time. I mean, not a long time ago, but about four years ago.

Speaker 2:          00:59:57       Do you think? Um, I mean, would there ever be human versus robot fights? Sure. Yeah. I W I can't wait.

Speaker 3:          01:00:06       They would have to dial the robots down. Right. They would have to them. Like when I was talking about, we were talking about before the show started that I think it would be cool to have a robot that moved at like 50% like a martial arts robot that you would be able to practice technique on. So you just would just, you'd basically would, you would do is do drills, right? Like you do like a Dutch combination, which is a one to left hook to the body, right leg kick. And you would do it like while it's in front of you advancing, you'd put that bag boom and it would have to like react to your punches, but they would do everything like 50% speed. So you could take a chance of this thing hitting you, but it probably wouldn't, but it would provide you with enough movement so that you could develop patterns in your mind and your body would like synchronize with these patterns so that in a real fight you would know what what you would have.

Speaker 3:          01:00:55       You'd have these things. It's sort of ingrained, like one of the things that happens in a fight is things happen that you don't think of. You just do them and you don't realize you were even going to do them until you already did it. Right? Because it's like you've drilled them into your subconscious. So you could do that with, with a robot and then maybe you can ramp the robot up to three quarters speed. If he got really good at it, then you couldn't really move and duck and it would be throwing punches at you trying to hit you

Speaker 2:          01:01:19       and they can record you so you can see what you're doing. Would that'd be helpful? That would, if you could look through the robot's eyes, you can put, just put a fucking GoPro on it. They're going to have a eyes, uh, uh, cameras soon.

Speaker 3:          01:01:30       Yeah. And then you're going to see someone's Dick Holes right in the camera. Log Out, locked up like a woman. She's not even gonna

Speaker 2:          01:01:42       like if you see cotton horns, that's the one thing about porns is like the moment the load hits, no matter how good of it actresses, the moment the loads hits, like this is always a brace for impact is always a flinch. Even the most number. Real pros, a real pro just takes it on the mug and just, just, there's, I don't know, like boxers. Some boxers is photos of them or they're getting hit with their ours or whatever. They never, they never squint. Ever since tumbler doesn't have porn, I'm feel like I'm off the map. Tomboy doesn't have porn. It used to used to have porn. It was super, it wasn't one of the most popular porn sites. What? Yeah. And they stopped doing porn. Do you know why? Probably because people complaining this

Speaker 4:          01:02:20       making too much money. It's too lucrative. Oh, they were making money on commerce. It was like a blog site and people were putting all this porn and they were getting shutdown. Well Twitter has porn. Yes it does. I follow the ideas. I'm fully fucking aware. Twitter is a lot of porn. Actually. I didn't realize that. I will only follow fucking annoying us news. Bullshit. Yeah. I mean I just, I Twitter, I'm just like all my friends and news outlets. I don't know if I want to like jerk off in between like CNN and business insider. I've looked at Twitter so infrequently. No, cause every time I look at it, it seems to be, it's fighting. It's exhausting arguing and you don't help me cause I was like this special and I loved your special because like you acknowledge, you're like, I'm gonna get in trouble for this or you're going to be like, that was just so fucking smart.

Speaker 4:          01:03:07       When I was writing this special, it's the first time I've ever done one where I started cutting bits because I was like, it's just not worth the fighting. Like I didn't want to fucking deal with it. You know? Like I had this whole bit on Marilyn Monroe and how I don't think she's like, I feel like she's being forced on us as like a feminist icon. Like all my girlfriends were like posting like photos of Marilyn Monroe being like, you know, always show up two hours late, keep a man waiting. I'm like, this woman is a fucking asshole. She's a slob. And why do I, why she's not my Gloria Steinem and I just had this whole bit and I'm just like, oh, they're going to say I don't like women and I'm to shaming slut-shaming I just like, it's not even fucking worth. But she's a weird one.

Speaker 4:          01:03:46       Right? Because she fucked everybody, which is not bad. It's not bad to fuck everybody. But she fucked everybody in. Apparently that's the real conspiracies of the Kennedy's had her killed because she was banging and JFK and then she was banging RFK and apparently she loose lips sink ships. Yup. Can't yapping a lot. And look, I, I'm gorgeous. Good for her, for making my back dad and making money the way you had to, but I just, let's let her be what she was. Why, why, you know, I think that she, that Hetty Lamar should get the credit that she gets, you know, I mean you talked about heading your special fucking Jean bad ass. She was a legitimate, insane, nobody gives a shit. I responsible for Wifi. People use wifi mostly to Google Marilyn Monroe quotes Patty Lamar came back to life. She be like, so did my invention.

Speaker 4:          01:04:35       Did it ever come of anything? We'd be like, yeah, good news, bad news. We mostly use it to Google the horror version of you. No, I don't. I don't. It's, it's, I love Marilyn Monroe. Like I just feel like there's this thing now where, you know, women, we can't criticize any woman ever or else that we get in trouble, you know? And uh, I think we have to be able to call people. Like I say in my special, I talk about the difference between women that are, um, does anyone have any girlfriends that think they're feminists but they're actually just assholes? You know? That's so true. And I know that I'm going to get shit for it. And that's like the men's rights guys. How many of the men's rights guys, just like, they talk about women, like they're pieces of meat, right?

Speaker 3:          01:05:18       Like is that really men's rights or are you just a piece of shit? Are you like, what are you doing here? Did you teach in people that they need to have rights? Are you teaching men how to manipulate vulnerable people?

Speaker 4:          01:05:31       And how do you have this kind of time to even like, I don't even unprofitable. Yeah. You know those books are profitable. Oh, it's like a whole business. Yeah. Those books. I mean guys give seminars on how to pick up women. Right? Oh right. Like the um, the game. Yeah. Diet theory. I remember when I used to, I, when I first came to la, like guys would do that and it was what? The try it on you? Yes. The first thing you do, well they, you're supposed to ignore the, it's nagging, right? You're supposed to ignore them and then you're supposed to do a compliment. That's actually an insult. Like every guy, when I first moved here, it'd be like, I really like how your eyes are crooked. Like it was like every guy would make the same thing. Who is that? Oh, that's the pickup artist guy.

Speaker 4:          01:06:10       Mystery. Yeah. The game that he like the host of the show, his name is mystery. Does he have a fake lip tattoo on his neck? Is that what that is? Kisses. Yeah, I think so. Why does he have two cock rings here? Like lipstick kind of thing. All right. Okay. Oh, the furry hat. Yeah. So he had a whole thing he was doing for awhile and then the eyeliner on. Oh yeah. Okay. This is like, who am I to judge Chris Angel Madness. Um, but, and then you would like, I try to ignore the girl. It was this whole thing we're supposed to be mean to her to make her like you or some shit. Yeah. Well that works on really vulnerable people and girls and treaty girls who are used to compliments and used to getting a lot of attention.

Speaker 3:          01:06:52       Well, for men that are ignored and that face rejection over and over and over again, they view women as if not the enemy as some s some source of negative feelings. Right. Yeah. And for you to get over on them would be to get some of that back. Right, right. All those bad feelings, bad encounters, negative interactions that you've had with women. Yeah. I had a friend that was like that over the time that I knew him. I've met him when he was in his twenties and as time went on into his thirties, he became more and more bitter and angry. His, he wasn't very attractive and he would have these interactions with women and they would wind up, you know, dumping him or abusing him. And he, he just got fucking angry. And then as he got older, he was just an angry guy. Like he just hated women and it was just because of rejection.

Speaker 3:          01:07:43       Like he associated them with pain and emotional discomfort. And so for a guy like that, and he, he wasn't into the game or anything like that, but for some of those guys that are vulnerable, like, you know, like this, uh, this incell thing, right? A lot of these men, involuntary celibates, they did develop these forum groups and subreddits and, and they meet up and, you know, talk about what to do and maybe I'll get facial surgery and yeah, look no further than what they want. Women. Yeah. Ultimately that's a compromise. They want a real woman, you know, they just,

Speaker 2:          01:08:16       they just got a shit roll the dice genetically. Yeah. I don't know a ton about, I mean, I've read articles about and said, but what it is, can they not get hookers or don't want to, or, well, that's a problem because hookers are illegal. Right, right. Like, you know, if you get hookers, you got to go through some sort of shady black market. Fucking Dantanna's like go to [inaudible]. Oh my God. Oh yeah. That old Santana. Yeah. D Joey. Joey Diaz was actually telling me about that today. Nights at Dantanna's. He says, yeah, Friday nights cock soccer. Yeah, that's exactly right. We will have you convinced you'll go there with a fucking newspaper. This is, no, there's no hookers. You'll be pretending like, I'm sit here and wait and I'll just read the paper and they'll show up. Yeah. There's no hookers. Yeah. Uh, putting, I remember I used to go in the four seasons all the time and people would come me like, ma'am, are you here to sit?

Speaker 2:          01:09:01       Like, they always thought I was a prostitute during the lobby. Yeah. Four seasons in Beverly Hills Peninsula. They thought you were a hooker and they're trying to get rid of, yes. Yeah. Oh, they'd be like, ma'am, are you here to see somebody or you're like, if I ever showed up alone because poker is just like wander around the four seasons lobby. Oh, how weird. The editory little coyotes. Oh my God. Of course I used to call my, when we used to go to the sky bar across the street from his that still exist. The monetary on sky bar exists in the morning. So it's across some of this call me store. Yeah. I used to have a whole

Speaker 3:          01:09:28       a bit about them, the coyotes cause they were like, they would pray on these guys. I was, I was hanging out once when me and a, a friend of mine and we heard this conversation between this fat balding guy and this really pretty girl with big tits and, and uh, he was like, do you coke? Do you do coke? She's like, yeah, sometimes. And I was like, oh cause it's like they would prey on these vulnerable, you know, like, like a pug. No, like a pug. The got out of the yard. That's what it felt like. Like, because these women would have this feral look in their eyes, like when, when you're down to fucking people for money, and that's how you get in by, and you got some cocaine in your purse and maybe a few dollars and you probably don't eat well. Nope. And you don't have a lot of money and then whatever money you do have you spending on drugs or whatever, and there's a feeling that you get when you're around them. Like they're feral. Yeah. Every day we're hustling. Yeah. They're hustling and they're looking for these vulnerable guys with money. Yeah. And so that's what, you know, the, the, that place would be the place where they would,

Speaker 2:          01:10:33       yeah. Mondrian. I remember when I first moved there. Yeah. You like wait in line to get in and there's a pool and occasionally that music is rock. They'd jump into the Pam Anderson famously like got naked and jumped in that pool. That was like the, which, yeah. Don't, that's it. That's it. We've already got, I've already had a public fight with her. I don't want to get you did. Yeah. On the roast. She was on the um, uh, David Hasselhoff roast and I mean, I, and I apologize to her. Did you say something about I said, uh, I believe I said Pam Anderson. You fucked Tommy Lee cared rock and who's the other one? Go. You Fuck Tommy Lee, Bret Michaels and kid rock. Why don't you just save yourself some time and drink a vat of magic Johnson's

Speaker 7:          01:11:18       okay.

Speaker 4:          01:11:21       Uh, uh, oh shit. I said a lot of shit about her vagina and uh, oh yeah, it didn't go great. I mean, all this shit. Like I just got asked to do the next roast and I was like, I don't even know if you can fucking do roasts anymore. Like roast battles still exist and they still go hard in the paint on Tuesday night of the car. That's right. We just didn't share this tonight. Yeah. We just did it in San Francisco and it was so fun. But I still found myself being like that peacefully. I mean, when we did Joan Rivers, I said, uh, Joan Rivers is so old, her vagina has a separate entrance for blacks.

Speaker 7:          01:11:51       Cox. We used to just be able to say that shit

Speaker 4:          01:11:59       and today I would fucking be run out of town. No, you just said it. I didn't fuck God. And then, I mean, I remember people used to think jokes were funny. People used to have a sense of humor. I mean, even fucking Joan, you know, I said Mike, Joan, they're all career. No eye opening joke for her was a Joan. I love doing the wrestler

Speaker 7:          01:12:20       Ish.

Speaker 4:          01:12:22       It was hilarious. Like you could, I imagine a good sense of humor the best. And she had such good sense of humor. Even during the roast, her face from plastic surgery was so frozen that cause you know, every time someone tells a joke you'll check in to see if the person that's being roasted is laughing to make sure. And she like Kinda, and she kept, we would look at her and like Greg Geraldo was just fucking hammering or in the audience was nervous. And then she said, she's like, I'm laughing. I had too much botox. Like she had to subtitle her face so that we all knew she was okay. But yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:12:50       Did the Breyer Improv once with Joey Diaz and Ari Shaffir and we got barbecued in the green room. I mean just barbecued. We went way too far. And Joan Rivers in her television show. It was when, when she did a television show where her daughter was on TV, I don't know what show it was. It was a reality show. Okay. And we were watching it on the, on the screen and her face looked like a Kabuki mass. It was just frozen.

Speaker 4:          01:13:18       Did you see the documentary? No. A piece of work. Yeah. It's pretty, you see, or she goes and gets it and talks about it. And why was she doing that? You know, I mean my girl look better. There was a lot, I don't know. I mean look it, I definitely get nervous sometimes and people are all, everyone always like accuse me of doing my shit to my face. I'm like, no, you'll know I'll look like a fucking moon bounce. Like allery gonna do it eventually. Yes, for sure. Why do people accuse you of it? Cause you don't look like you did. Thank you very thin nose though. They would worry that you did your nose. It's wild because you'd think I got my notes about my note. Nationals are crooked. I went to a doctor in Beverly Hills because I had sinus problems for longest time and he actually said, you know, I, I can you have a septic? What does it deviate itself? It's like you have a deviated septum. And I was like, what do you do? Like he was like, we can get a nose job if he, yeah, totally. And I never did it because you know when your nose is thin. Thank you. If

Speaker 2:          01:14:12       he did it, what would he do? Make it fan nostrils equal. Even though they're really asymmetrical and it's like problematic and sometimes in its problem when I do something in television, sometimes they have to fix my nostrils and posts to make them even who gives a fuck about you now? It's just distracting. I feel like those things are there just to find out who's really weird. Like if you really freaking out about someone's asymmetrical nostrils. Yeah. It's just, I mean the key to most movie stars is they're symmetrical. You know? They're just like, you know, think about the most beautiful women in the world. Have some symmetry. But yeah, I don't, it's wild. I mean I have, I mean I talk about it, my special, I have had surgery on my boobs. I did have boobs done hollow, which is kind of this might interest you.

Speaker 2:          01:14:56       The I, I was learning, um, because I had all kinds of shit and the way that they make boobs look good is cause I think I heard you talking about someone about the shitty old breast and plants, the way they make them good now is that they put you on like a crucifix and they do the surgery while you're standing up. Watch. So that they saw you were out cold. Yes. So that they fall well in your mind. God really? Oh that's so I finally went to a guy that knew how to do that. Woo. Yeah. It's a lot of fucking miles. But, so I admit what I have, you know, but on my face it is alarming because it does feel like female Comedians, a couple of famous ones that we know and they age went down that route. I don't know if it's like the same thing that got you into comedy is the same thing that made you think you had to do that.

Speaker 2:          01:15:40       You know, I've read a lot of stuff about like childhood sexual abuse. Like when people go really off the grid with their face, that's like a type of dysmorphia or a lot of people, a lot of um, oh, psychologists have said, cause I've talked to a therapist who's job is, uh, in Dysmorphia to advise on whether it's another surgery should be done by somebody. Like if they're getting dysmorphic. And a lot of times it's, if you've had childhood sexual abuse, you want to change your face so that it's not, you don't see the person in the mirror that got to be like in some Michael Jackson thing. Yeah. Yeah. It's like a childhood thing. The Michael Jackson thing was always that he hated his father and he hated looking at his father and his own face. So when it's that extreme, I try to like not judge cause I'm like, oh there might be some psychological shit that I don't know about for sure.

Speaker 2:          01:16:25       You know, but it's getting worse and worse with this Instagram shit because kids are grown. I mean it used to be like we had acne and we'd go to school with acne, you know, but now it's like you're projecting this flawless perfect face and then you have to show up at school with fucking acne the next day. Like also it's like people want their face to actually look like in the Instagram filter, which is bananas, bananas, photo-shopped it doesn't. But again, it's a test to see who's fucked up. Like who wants that? Not, not girl, who wants that as far as guy, like what guy wants that? It's, I'm so confounded by what I'm seeing. But like also you just want to look like everybody else when you're young was a weird thing is women wanting to be super skinny. That's a weird one. I feel like that's always been around now.

Speaker 2:          01:17:09       Well it's a new model, skinny thing. It's because it's not, it's not attractive to men. Like men like asses we like, I mean everyone's different. Right? But yeah, I like girls with meat. Well cause that also translates to fertility. I mean it's like we want someone that looks for sure and you know healthy. Yeah. Robot. I want to grow up and carry a couch with me for real. That's really endear you want to grow. You pick up the end of the couch while it's moving over here. Like I don't expect you to pick up the whole couch. Pink lot a someone though instead of looking into the couch it's going to be harder for you than me, but we don't have to carry that far. I don't know this trend of super skinny because it doesn't really make sense on like a primordial level. Why it's a model.

Speaker 2:          01:17:51       It's a model thing because for clothes they want a girl to be a clothes hanger. They want a skinny girl that just looks good sashaying down the runway with their bag of bones, which I was reading like, and I actually did like a whole like paper on this when I was in college about actually the reason that fashion had, you know, such tiny models is because they were just, there was a shortage on fabric during World War Two. So they just started making dresses smaller and then models skinnier. Like it wasn't, yeah, it wasn't even really something that we wanted it. I always assumed it was gay dudes. I'm sure that gay dudes who are into twinks so they uh, can you say two weeks without getting arrested? How's it work? Just made me nervous. Lady Cohen got in trouble for saying something about twinks isn't it?

Speaker 2:          01:18:36       This is the whole thing. I can't, so it's just like fucking hell, it's addicted. Here's what did help me though. I, someone was saying, I read, and I think this is on your podcast, I'm 2% of all people on Twitter make 80% of the comments. Yes. So it's on us for amplifying that 2%. It's real. It's not that many fucking ball. It just feels big. It's not the world you go out in the world and you would think that it's going to be just knife fights, fucking antifungals, this shit bottle and people have to, when I went on tour after the Roseanne thing, everyone was like, what happened to Rosie? That was so funny. I was like, you didn't hear half the people didn't even know about. I know most people didn't know about it and then I was on tour and this is, I mean there's some stuff in the special that I'm sure like blogs are going to come at me for, but you know, I was going around and talking about all the stuff happening in the news and sexual harassment stuff and getting your ass grabbed at work. At one time I was in Houston. This woman does, he yelled out, I was like a guy that grabs you in the ass. She went take the compliment and move on.

Speaker 2:          01:19:38       She's probably all drunk. She's just like, this is such an la New York. Fuck it. You know? So it was just like jokes. This is a different world. So many points of view that we're just not, that are not being heard. You know the Twitter point of view is very strange. It's like you have right-wing Twitter, left wing Twitter and black Twitter because we have three different completely or in our little echo chamber and it just feels so much bigger than it is. You out in the world and you're like, oh you guys just want to fucking laugh. Outreach culture. How do you end? Well, how will this end? I it ends with mine

Speaker 6:          01:20:08       reading software. Okay. For Real. I think what's happening right now is it's we're all, we're okay if you say something and you have a certain intent and that intent is not accurately expressed by the sounds you're making with your mouth. I can choose to get mad, but if I can read what you're thinking then the, I know what your intent is and then we'd be able to tell. I'd be able to read your face and go, oh Joe's joking cause we're right in front of each other. Right. That's what's missing on Twitter. There's no social cues. Don't translate texts. How many times is a friend sent you a text message and you think they're serious and they're just joking. Most of the arguments in my life, so many times I'll send some, cause I say fucked up things on text message. Half my text messages to my friends are heinous.

Speaker 6:          01:20:57       I mean me and Kalyan and show out, but I can show all psychotic Joey Diaz every week since the pictures of his shit. He sends me the other day, he showed me his balls for like 20 minutes. I'm sure his balls are unbelievable, ridiculous, gorgeous. They look like Kim Kardashians, but they're very rare. But is, what is that? Is that just, um, are they fake? Like you'd have this Joey dios. This is, let me look at that gigantic log of shit. That's, that looks like a fucking cell. That's just, no, no, no. I've seen those in real life. He would leave them in the toilet. For me, this isn't healthy. I would go into the room, not if I can healthy associate Joey d Diaz with healthy, first of all, notice that it's not even in the water. It's on the beach next to the water gives me the fucking Willie because he's kind of big and he doesn't really fit on the toilet correctly.

Speaker 6:          01:21:47       Doesn't break off. Why doesn't his sphincter cut it? Holds it in for anything. His finger, the Calamari has his finger, his loose sing. When he lets it loose it's just like a log jam that just got released like a, like they opened up a dam on the river. I just whoa. I fucking nightmares. Giant piece of shit. So he'll send me pictures of his shit. I just held her hand by accident. Yeah. I needed some emotional comfort sister. Where, what are we doing sister? Thank God he's alive cause he's one of those guys. It's just like whatever outrage. One of the things that I used to love about going on the road with him, which is tragically he's two successful. Joey Diaz is famous now so I can't really take him on the road with me as much anymore cause he's always booked. But the beautiful thing was, but he will be working with me tonight, the comedy store.

Speaker 6:          01:22:34       The beautiful thing was when I take him on the road, he would open everybody up like so hard. They'll like, all the taboos are out the window by the time I go on stage. Oh, oh yeah. That's such a fucking great smart choice. Yeah. They weren't before. People like, he's so funny. Why would you want to follow him? I'm like, well I think that's in your head. Cause I think if you're funny, you're funny. Yes. I mean he's definitely funnier than me. He's funny than everybody has ever lived, but he's also building shakes when jazz on stage. He's a, but he

Speaker 3:          01:23:06       also, he, he lays the foundation that it's, everything's on the table.

Speaker 4:          01:23:11       You know, he used to do that at the roast was Greg Giraldo. Yes. He would go out and he would just say the shit that even a rosy be like, oh fuck. And he'd go first. Well people were, hadn't even had drinks yet, you know what I mean? Like he said, um, ice tea, you're so old. You used your first residual check to buy your freedom. I'm saying, Gee, is bunny like that would be like his opening joke. Oh my God. It was like five 30 on a Sunday. It was like, Oh me, Oh my God, here's the plugins your first visit you, oh my God. Like he would just come sort and the audience wouldn't even know what to do, but that's something he was so fucking unbelievable

Speaker 3:          01:23:55       TV at the same time. And we were right next to each other, uh, on the lot at Gower, sunset and Gower. Yeah, I was a news radio and he had his own show for a bit and his show was right next to my show and we would hang out, you know, cause we're, we're both guys from New York that were more from the east coast at least, that were doing comedy and we're out here, I'll tell, oh, this is crazy. You know, and, and, and I, I'd have thought he would die like that. Like when he died of a drug overdose, I was like, Greg, well he had been sober. Yeah. What happened? You went to a party and someone gave him some shit.

Speaker 4:          01:24:28       I mean, it's so tricky when my, I mean I get worried, I'm like a fucking mom about this shit. What my guy, you know anyone goes on the road and you're getting shit. You don't know how strong it is. You're getting it from random people. I think he had been sober and his tolerance was low and just tried to go back to what had

Speaker 3:          01:24:45       that one was. I think so, but I don't know all the details that fucking need for escape. The need for the pill thing.

Speaker 4:          01:24:54       Does it feel like though in general comics are getting healthier? Like you pro, you saw the days when everyone was on blow and everyone, it feels like everyone's down Jamba juice and on it and Kombucha and the real problem is I can't imagine drinking money because of that. You know? I mean I don't, Amy, we've definitely lost our balls.

Speaker 3:          01:25:16       Some people think that in order to be a comedian you have to be at least a little bit self destructive, like the great one.

Speaker 4:          01:25:24       You have to have good styles for you to get good stories. Yeah. I started going to therapy and I was like, fuck, what do I talk about paying my mortgage on time? This isn't funny.

Speaker 3:          01:25:32       It's a problem. You can wealthy, right? You don't have any fear of, you know, your, your bills are paid

Speaker 4:          01:25:37       when you stopped doing desperate shit and making mistakes. You just have less interesting stories. Certainly. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:25:42       there's that. But it doesn't always have to be stories. Right. But I also think its perspective gets very skewed when you live a life of leisure. Yeah. You know, when you live a life of leisure and comfort and privilege, which most wealthy comedians do, that's when they all start to suck. Like when comedians have, usually they have a few good years,

Speaker 2:          01:26:04       like they make it and then they have like one or two good specials and then they have some that just what happened. Sloppy. Because you think they just don't have to fight as hard or, I think a lot of times I hear, you know, people will schedule their special, they're like, I'm shooting your special night. It's march. It's like they have you written it like you schedule it before you're finished with this, the Eddie Murphy thing. Oh really? You know, Eddie Murphy just got a $70 million. He hasn't done standup in 30 years. So like how many times does he get, look, I think first of all, just as an aside or just a, to start this off, I'm not bashing him. I'm a giant Eddie Murphy Fan of it. Anybody who thinks that Eddie Murphy should do stand up again. It's me and I've even talked about on this podcast that he did that he did some speech on a podium where he's talking about how bad bill Cosby fucked up because they had a, he had to give his, uh, his awards back, you know, I mean, oh shit.

Speaker 2:          01:26:55       It was hilarious segment. It's hilarious. And I was like, God damn, his timing is so good. I wish he would do stand up again and just jump on. He was at the comedy store walking the halls a couple times on and on Tuesdays. This was like a couple years ago and he just walked in and he just like looked like he was on a people mover. He was just like float through the hallways and you know the hallways, it's like fucking bay root in those hallways. And I've always just get super quiet and I'm like, is that fucking anymore? This scouting hasn't done stand up in 30 years. That's how God damn like, you know, as Nice as look, uh, Tim Allen is Tim Allen hasn't done standup in forever either. But if he walks by or by his saw, that's that guy from home improvement. Yeah. You know, they're not like freaking out that he's there.

Speaker 2:          01:27:37       He was so good during delirious, like when we were kids, you'd watch that you, but he was so god damn good that today, I mean Rockledge and of it just carries on. I mean, the real question is when he comes back, are people going to start tearing apart his old specials and saying, oh, 100% of the phobic and Oh yeah, oh yeah. Oh yeah. Can work. Like, well, you people are going after people for George, John Wayne, John Wayne. That's the best ones. He's canceled his cans like, okay, he's been dead for decades. It's not woken up in the 70s you said bad things about black people or something. Now where it's like Picasso's cancel, he's canceled. Oo. Kowalski's canceled man. Like the fucking, the costume was in Barbera, whatever her name is. What's her name? Hannah Gadsby. She had a fucking thing about Picasso. Like, hey babe, you gotta let that go.

Speaker 2:          01:28:32       That was a long time ago. He admitted. I mean, it's like, that's the other thing. It's all these people who put their mental illness and struggles on and they would probably agree with us. Oh, for sure. They were fucked up for Chanel. Like van Gogh was shitty to his subjects. It's like, oh, I mean, you see it in his work. You know, there's people that want to forgive people though for things like wrong. Remember when there's a lot of Roman Polanski apologists? Oh, I don't, I don't think I cut. There's quite a few. Yeah, I mean they, in Hollywood, yes. Legitimate actors

Speaker 4:          01:29:02       and actresses that were saying, you know, it's time to let it go and leave. He's an amazing artist and it fucking raped good Rosemary's baby's fucking great movie. But I think he's, he, he's done it. It's a rap. But there are people like Stanley Kubrick who is arguably the, my, my favorite genius ever. And, and filmmaking, which by the way, yeah, I was reading that. Um, uh, the guy that directed x Mokena kind of loosely based the guy on Stanley Cooper. Did you ever see, and then as soon as I thought about that, I was like, Oh yeah, tell Alex Garland I think is, uh, that guy's name that wrote it. I thought that was interesting. But have you ever seen like the videos of Kubrick Directing Shelly La and all the stories about how he terrorized her throughout the production to get her into a, I mean, he didn't want her to sleep.

Speaker 4:          01:29:52       He wanted to have bags under her eyes. He would wake her up in the middle of the night and he'd scream at her and call her cot and then be like, I'm going to be like, action. And then she'd be like, fuck, like it was, her performance is unbelievable. And it's like ti was tear right today. That would be a hostile work environment to being olive oil and the Popeye movie with Problem Williams and then she just quit. Yeah. I mean, her agent, she was so good in the shining and then she doesn't do it. Does emotional abuse make great art? I don't know. It's, I'm not, no. The same thing happened to Ricky Schroder and the champ. Oh, John Voight was like really shitty with him. He was a little kid. He was like six, seven years old. Really shitty mean to him before the scenes you start crying. I mean there's also, there's a, um, there's a director who, um, there was an explosion in a movie and the actor, you know, it's a fake explosion and you're going, oh, and then one take, he was like, just make it around.

Speaker 4:          01:30:49       Just don't tell him in the fucking take was amazing and the actor got all pissed off. But the fucking work, you know, you get to get credit for that. So it's this tricky thing. Like I was a, I did a show called Adam ruins everything. You know that show. It's, he's just a smart dude and he just asked me to do a little guest spot and I had to play a flight attendant in the fifties who was getting sexually harassed like that was the scene and because that's what I guess airlines used to do that they would sort of pimp out their flight attendants. If you were engaged and weren't allowed to wear your ring, you had to be filler. Yeah. It was like the episodes are really interesting. Supposed to be really hot. Right. That whole thing had to be a certain size and you had to be young and then you had to kind of like, what did they let that go? It was kind of implied. Delta weight 235 pounds. He was five foot four. Nice guy though, but it was like a dating service back then basically. And Adam did the whole thing on it and I was in there and it felt very much, everyone was like, okay, whatever you feel comfortable with. And it was like, no, we have to do that. We have to make this feel uncomfortable. You know, like don't worry about my feelings right now. You know, it's like, you know, so there is just this conversation

Speaker 2:          01:32:00       about like, uh, no hostile work environment and everyone needs to feel emotionally safe. Like, well, can you, could you make the shining today? Well, can you get to that place without being harassed? If you're a really good actress, would you be really crazy? Of course, but I just, you know, you still have to do it, you know, go for it. I mean, isn't that the argument about great actors that they kind of have to be crazy like a Daniel Day Lewis type actor? You have to kind of be like, that's why they're method actors, right? They stay in that mindset because to maintain that mindset is really the only way to achieve it. Like you almost kind of have to be there all the time. But also the being in character thing, like when people like, you know, bitch about like when Christian Bale had his, you know, melt their meltdown and stuff.

Speaker 2:          01:32:40       It's like, I mean it's just, there's so many people on a set and there's so many distractions and you know, you at some point you're just like, I have, it's impossible to fucking focus. But then there's also, there's losers on set, sometimes it fuck things up and then get in the way. That does happen. Yeah. The fact that they recorded him screaming at that guy, I was like, well, I want to know what that guy did and who was that guy? That guy might be a moral, hadn't he been starving himself for like seven months or something? That's the mechanic think it's the same movie. It's just like, you know, he's mechanical. He said, I'm the machine and I'm the face of this fucking movie. I'm under all this pressure. I have to get this thing. We're losing light and this fucking guy cell phone goes off or I don't know exactly what happened, you know?

Speaker 2:          01:33:22       But I do think when Daniel Day Lewis is like, I'm calling me Mr Link, our nobody talked to me. It might just be his waving, like, just fucking stop asking me if I want hummus. Like, just let me fucking focus, you know, I think for like really intense roles, which I've never done, so I'm just completely talking out of my ass. I would think that you might have to maintain some really crazy state of mind to get there so it doesn't look fake because you know how you know how like you see, did you ever see the movie punch line with Sally Fields? It's interesting to me, but when Sally fields is killing, I'm like, get the fuck up. Like that's, no one's laughing at that. It's not real. When people, when actors do standing up, I think real stand up. They're like, okay, what you know who's nails it though?

Speaker 2:          01:34:08       That lady who plays the marvelous Mrs Nasal. She's amazing. I love [inaudible]. I love her at some legit it does. Well it's also in the fifties I think. Right? But even the guy who plays Lenny Bruce is great and I agree. I haven't got show brother and there was a, you know, but like the one on showtime Castro comics member, Eric Griffin was on it and now magical was on it. That one on showtime dying up here. Yeah. You know, just like Castro comics, but the writing one that was like a little shoddy dicey. But uh, but I, I'm sure it's different for everyone, but I do think though sometimes, you know, you've been on sets, like if you have to do a scene with somebody where you're screaming, you hate each other if you're hanging out all day on Instagram and then it's just like, it's hard to unfaced like chemistry or knowing someone. So I just think it's interesting, like, you know, Stanley Kubrick probably would be cancelled today probably. Yeah. Especially by people

Speaker 6:          01:34:58       who don't understand what's required in order to achieve what he's trying to get. Yeah. Kubrick was a mad man though. I mean he used to do complex mathematics in his spare time.

Speaker 4:          01:35:08       Yeah. Like as a hobby, right? Yeah. Like, but he would do calculus and stuff like that. He would do shit where he would, yeah. I think on eyes wide shut. He did like do 80 takes of Tom cruise walk into the door and then I'll show up. Like he didn't want actors acting like he wanted them. He wanted them in the actual state of mind instead of acting like they were in that actual state of mind. Like he wanted that. So he really wanted Tom Cruise to be like exhausted and fucking pissed off and annoyed. So he's like, go piss him off and then let me know when he's in that state. I mean you would like terrorize Shelley Duvall. It's like kind of famous and she looks, yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:35:41       Fucking terrifying. Yeah. You know, so she's working with Jack Nicholson and there's a great video of him preparing for one of the scenes. Oh fuck. And he's jumping up and down and throwing his arms in the air.

Speaker 8:          01:35:54       Wow.

Speaker 6:          01:35:56       Like freaking out. You know, you can, you could see him working himself up before the scene. I mean he, it's like those scenes that he did, especially like the acts through the bathroom door. You can't just go into that cold.

Speaker 4:          01:36:07       You've got some of that in your worked up. Yeah. It's wild. Like I'm so obsessed with that movie cause like the little things he did to make you feel uneasy in a subliminal way.

Speaker 6:          01:36:17       Awesome. He's getting ready for the CIA. He's like jumping her half and town.

Speaker 8:          01:36:21       How can she just, she's like, okay, I'm in here and he's like, fucking, yeah, this guy,

Speaker 4:          01:36:29       I don't know. Yeah, there's nine people that want to like ask him if he needs any hand sanded. Oh gotcha. Oh yeah. That's a guy with a walkie talkie going in there. D is really dressed up like golfers

Speaker 8:          01:36:42       the fuck

Speaker 6:          01:36:44       and preppy. Azel it's a great God damn movie. You know that movie Stephen King didn't like that movie?

Speaker 4:          01:36:49       Well yeah. Well that's why they say that the car on the road that's crashed on the road, there's a red car in the beginning of the movie that's crashed on the side of the road. And then Stephen King's version, there was a red car, so Cooper crashed that car and then it was a yellow car. So he actually put shit in the movie to like troll Stephen King. Kind of amazing. That's hilarious. But he did shit that was so fascinating. Like little things to make you feel uneasy. Like continuity errors. Like he'd cut to a scene, there'd be a, like if there was a chair behind you cut away. Cut back and there'd be no chair shit you wouldn't really notice in case you were like dissecting it. But

Speaker 6:          01:37:24       there's also a lot of weird references in that movie to the Apollo Moon landing.

Speaker 4:          01:37:27       That's right. Like saying that Weird Shit and the native American genocide, it's apparently a pretty big theme in it. Um, but yeah, of course. And the way that he, um, I mean there's a whole documentary about this, but yeah. That the carpet, the, when the kid is riding the bicycle around the carpet that he shot at both ways and inter cut them. So with the continuity's not working and it just makes you feel, Oh yeah, he was fun.

Speaker 6:          01:37:53       There's a great documentary. The guy who

Speaker 3:          01:37:56       followed [inaudible] around, he was like his assistant, he was an actor and he was acting and something that Kubrick did and Kubrick wind up hiring him as an assistant and then he just did all Kubrick's movies and hung out with them all the time. It's a really strange, yeah. Yeah. Well the documentary is really good. It's, what is it? Gonna do you know what it is? A room two, three, six. One. What is it? The last tape? I think it's on Netflix, I believe, right? No, no, no. It's the guy who hang hung around with Stanley Kubrick. It's about him. I think it's a feeling more pictures. Is that it? Oh, maybe that's it. A life in pictures. 2001 no, no, no. I don't think so. Just Google the guy who worked film marker. That's it. Right. So this guy just sort of realized somewhere along the line like, oh man, I'll never be able to make a fucking movie.

Speaker 3:          01:38:47       Like I'll never be able to do what he's doing, so I'm just going to start working with him. So he's his personal assistant. He started out as an actor and he just worked with Kubrick through all of his movies. Oh, wild. Yeah. And somehow or another, they just click together. So he wound up working for him. So it's like, you probably don't know the name. Leon Vitaly, scroll down. Please stop you. You don't know the name Leon Vitaly, but the upcoming documentary film work or hopes to change that forever. Yeah. British actor. Yeah. Stan Stanley Kubrick to play the world. Lord bullingdon and Barry London. Yeah, it's a, it's interesting because this guy sort of devoted his life to like to work with Kubrick.

Speaker 4:          01:39:30       It's interesting. Like, and that was also back in the day, I think Cooper would do like a movie every for like five years or something. It's like, that's back when you made a movie when it was ready. Now everyone's like movie every eight months at noon. Well, you know the apocalypse now story, right? No movie took forever. Oh, right. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:39:47       The movie took like seven fucking years to make. Just don't write that. No, no. That's a Francis Ford Coppola. Oh, okay. That's like, I don't think Oliver Stone wrote that. Maybe.

Speaker 4:          01:39:58       I think he was involved in some way. I don't think so. I'm kind of obsessed with a lot of our stone. Yeah. I wrote, I wrote a, uh, my honors thesis in college about so fucking Dorky, the postmodern implications of the movie, JFK, Da. I was just obsessed with that movie. Like at the right at the time we had it had the most edits in any movie ever. And the way that they just did mixed me. I just fucking loved the movie and I just wanted to write about it and dissect it

Speaker 3:          01:40:24       movie. But the problem is they sorta, he makes it seem like you know exactly what happened. Right. And the reality is we don't know exactly what happened. We don't know who killed JFK. It was very likely that it wasn't Lee Harvey Oswald though. Yeah, it did. If it was that, if Lee Harvey Oswald did take a shot, he didn't take the only shots. There was other people shooting yet. Right. It's just so fun. It was just so fucking blew my mind the way that he makes movies. Pots. I mean, I don't think we even grasp

Speaker 6:          01:40:54       the idea that someone shot the fucking president on TV. I can't, well actually it wasn't on TV. I'm sorry. Do I mean there's, did you ever, um, what was the story about the guy who shot himself in the mouth? He ate skate song. Hey Man, nice shot. Is that what that named after? Yeah, that's about, uh, and he was about to go to jail and get a press conferences house. And then he blew his head off. He pulled out a 44 magnum and stuck it in his mouth. Pennsylvania. Yeah. Yeah. Pennsylvania. Can you imagine? So that's on faces of death. I didn't know that was bad. Then watch that so many times from the nine years. I could see it in my head right now. So it was on and they just couldn't cut it because it was live television. Well, he gave a press conference.

Speaker 6:          01:41:38       I just put a gun in his mouth and blew the top of his head off and they're like, no, don't, don't, don't. He's like, oh. And he did it like really quick before anybody could get to him. He just blew the top of his fucking head on how many views that has on youtube. Well, it's crazy. Like how quick the blood starts pouring out of his nose. That was one of the weird things. Like, oh, that's what happens. Yeah. I mean it makes sense, I guess for sure. Just to be able to be that composed about it. Yeah. He probably wasn't healthy, but, and I think he was going to be innocent.

Speaker 6:          01:42:11       Fucking, oops. I think so. Well sometimes people getting dragged through the mud. That's enough. That was why Bordain killed himself. Public shaming. She was, I mean, besides the depression, he was terrified that he was going to get dragged through the mud because he had paid off. That boy whose girlfriend had fucked and he would had been so prominently defending women and you know, and going after Harvey Weinstein, Weinstein in this whole me too movement thing. And then all of a sudden he was this great hypocrite because his girl had, you know, she had sexually molested a 17 year old kid and couldn't handle, which is fine by the way. Listen, there's a lady who just got off and there's all this fucking talk about it. There are people that, people are so mad. Joey Diaz put it on his Twitter. Nothing wrong with the good Dick Sucking. She blew.

Speaker 6:          01:42:59       She blew some 14 year old kid and it's on Twitter. One took it off. Who took it off out there? I looked at Joey's. What came down? Twitter took a known, so I retweeted it. Is it because of his 10 minutes? Basically. Why? Why would they take it? Deleted it? I don't know. Twitter tweet them. I just decided that it was against the terms of service or something. They're getting really weird with stuff. I mean that's just a joke. Well people are getting so does that mean people snitched cause there's not an algorithm or like a spider program looking for that? Um, people must have complained that. I don't know. I'm looking for it right now. I don't see it on my Twitter. Oh fuck. That means it was taken down if I was typing deleted it. But he can still retweet something if it's deleted. Right. That goes away then. No, it's right here dude. It's here. I was

Speaker 2:          01:43:52       just looking at this page. Oh, you didn't go back from, I didn't find it. That was from this morning. Bronx teacher who performed oral sex on 14 year old gets 10 years probation. Avoid jail teaching certificate. So I'm saying performed. It didn't take that long to get the job. Did she? Four minutes. There was a camera. There was a lot going on. It was the, it was a 32nd yes. Sloppy meth. There was a lot going on in there, but meanwhile nobody cares. She didn't go to jail. Everybody's like, okay. Apparently a lot of people will commit suicide after being on reality shows that you don't really to hear about it just because you get so famous and then nobody gives a shit about you and you don't have money. Yeah, and you don't have money, Toby. Yeah. That's pretty well to have that kind of fame and out of nowhere and to not really know why you have it and then have it taken away from you and then to not have any money. I mean, think about it. Yeah. The kind of psychological tests apparently you have to take to be on a reality show are pretty hardcore. Not In the fear factor does. Oh really? I bet they would just talk to people. How are you doing? Ready to eat? Some eggs were there, they were background checks and shit though.

Speaker 3:          01:45:00       [inaudible] a few. We, we clearly had some insane people on that. You know what mean they're getting paid $50,000 if they won. Sometimes it was more like it was a big episode, like they would win a million. Um, we had one guy who won $1 million, started speaking in tongues, so 11 [inaudible]. He was like super religious and he was going to give all the money to like, he was going to tithe 10% of his money. It was like $100,000. Um, and he was, uh, that was one of the rare ones where they went a million, but most of them was 50,000.

Speaker 2:          01:45:33       Did you get to have say and the stuff that they did?

Speaker 3:          01:45:36       No, no. Say and I'd most of the time didn't know. I didn't know until I got there. That's fucking crazy. Yeah. Part of it was me, I didn't want to know because I know your shit. But part of it was because part of it is because I thought it would be better if it was a surprise to me. So the day of I could be kind of more enthusiastic about it cause it was so crazy because some of the stunts were so fucking crazy. But there was a few times where I told them to stop. I told him, don't do this. One of them, contestants and producers, everybody. I said, let's not do this one, don't do it. And they were like, you're crazy. I'm like, why don't we had people ride bowls and that was the first one. I was like, you guys are out of your fucking mind.

Speaker 3:          01:46:15       This is so dangerous. Roman games at this point. Well your, they had a 98 year old, a 90 pound 98 pound girl. She was 98 pounds. She was so tiny and they made a ride the bolt and she went fall lying through the air. Just got so lucky that the bold didn't kick her in the face and I'm telling you it kicked up and her head was here and the foot won't like this. Just right by her friends. Is that even legal? Like legal. You sign off on the waiver. The people ride bulls take a chance. I mean that's exactly what happened. And I was telling people don't do this. And I told the producers, I said, don't do this. Look, I have had a healthy fear of animals my whole life. I was attacked by a goat when I was like seven years old.

Speaker 3:          01:46:54       So it was Hitler. Really? Yeah. Hitler lost the testicle to a goat goat in my is that, no, makes sense. Myth. It sounds is like a myth. As I said it. I remember him missing I think a goat bit. What it is. Nuts. Sorry. I was hit, I was budded by goat and my stepfather had to come and save me like a petting zoo. No, it was at a um, a farm co-op when we lived in San Francisco, there was a, my step dad went back to school and uh, he was a, who was originally a computer programmer and then he was going back to school to be an architect. And one of the things that he did with part of his a university was they had some sort of a, some sort of a farming co-op thing. We didn't, you had to take care of like certain like farming chores and there was the animals like, like goats and I was a little kid and then we got left in this fucking room with this goat, this pen with a gun.

Speaker 3:          01:47:48       It was fine for the beginning and then the goat fucking just came at me and slammed his, uh, did it head worn chest? Yeah. Oh yeah. There no joke. And I remember I'm grabbing the horns, but I didn't have any strength. I was a little kid, you know, I was maybe eight at the time and he had to come and save me and I was like, Jesus Christ. And I remember thinking from that time on like, oh, like you've got to get this idea of what an animal is out of your head. Like they, they, they, they, he didn't, that thing didn't give a fuck. Have I died? This is what they just stomped me to death. It would have been fine.

Speaker 4:          01:48:17       This is it. Was I right about that or is that there could be a total, Google's Hitler's, not Hitler goat. Not Governments. Do you now, there are two things about our algorithms.

Speaker 9:          01:48:28       It doesn't have anything to do with it. I guess he had a undescended testicle apparently. And then he also had something called a Hypo spatty ass. Hmm. Something to do with, uh, the urethra whole being on the underside of the penis and not where it should be.

Speaker 4:          01:48:46       Right. Or had a fucked up penis. Of course he did. That's why I was so angry. It makes so much sense. What nick did. Did he not have any goat accidents typed in? Go to this? It said rap. What is like, I need to figure out where that fucking came from. But so many of the city was bit by a goat in his younger days, but it's okay. Been like goat. I didn't get his balls. Howard is attached to his manhood. I think every kid was bit by goat at some point. Fun back then. Well, it's also, it's like why? It's like people always come in. It's like all this us taking selfies with tigers and shit. I'm like, what are you doing right? What are you doing? They're fucking Wa like you're in. This is insane. There's this new selfie culture where we all are like taking selfies with the bears and shit. It's like, use your head. It's all everybody wants to do is take pictures of things now for their Facebook, it's like, it's like the new fucking realm. I think we're going to look back and the same way we look at Caligula neurone we're like, oh, they used to just have lions fight elephants for entertainment. Now we're going to look back and go, remember when we used to like take selfies with bears and ride elephants

Speaker 3:          01:49:50       blank and you'll have a picture of things clean. I think that's ultimately one of the ways they're going to get us this. This Elon Musk thing is kind of interesting because they're trying to put these little fibers in your brain and it'll have some sort of Bluetooth link that increases your bandwidth with the Internet, but I think the way they're going to get us as a hard drive that replaces your memory because your memory is so shitty. Yeah. Yeah. I mean I have a pretty decent memory in, in terms of like being able to recall information and facts and stuff like that. But if I had to draw a picture of House that I lived in just 10 years ago, I'd be like, oh, I can't, I don't know what I saw.

Speaker 4:          01:50:27       But what about the things you want to forget? Like our brain is pretty good at denial for self preservation purposes, right? So what will you, how will you brain, how will your brain handle? Cause denial is a survival mechanism. There are things we have to block out in order to continue functioning or else we'd go crazy.

Speaker 3:          01:50:47       Right? So like people when they're molested, when they're young, that's one of the things that they, they have hypnotic regression and then they remember it.

Speaker 4:          01:50:54       Yeah, exactly. Or EMDR or whatever the thing is that brings it to the surface. But I think denial serves a really important part in a lot of people's psyche. Yes, sure. Or else you're going to allows you to move on. Yeah, totally. You know, so it's the I, that is what scares me. It's going to be hard for, I think, trauma survivors. Certainly people in the military, there's probably some shit you want to forget, right. You'll be able to access it over and over again, like the bud Dwyer version. Yeah. I don't want to play that shit on a loop and my brain brilliantly made that, erase that. Yeah. So I didn't have to think about it, you know. Yeah. That's the one thing about that that's alarming to me. But our, our memories are so flawed and, and there's this amazing neurologist in New York called Morgan Surf and he's got a bunch of shit on Ted talks and stuff. And uh, he, I went to this lecture he did in New York about how our memories essentially were like comics. Like we punch up the parts of stories that get the bigger responses and oh yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:51:49       I mean, I've talked to so many friends about things that happen when we're younger and their version of it is so different than mine am. I did we really do that? I don't remember doing that. I've had friends tell me about fights where I did something to somebody and I beat somebody's ass. I'm like, I know that didn't happen. Like you might think that didn't happen. I didn't beat anybody.

Speaker 4:          01:52:06       Didn't I tell you about there was a time that I was in Portland with somebody and they were like Joe Rogan, him and I got in a car accident in high school. I remember I texted you about it and you're like, that never happened. It, I don't remember. We got in a car accident. Guy was like, oh yeah, I know Joe Rogan. We got in a car accident in high school and I definitely got in a car accident in high school once, but we texted about it and you're like, that didn't happen. Oh was he had a crazy walk. I saw one of you had repressed or it was just while I definitely had

Speaker 3:          01:52:34       car accident. Hi hydroplaned right outside school. I was leaving school. I had a 1968, four, four two. It's an Oldsmobile like a hot rod. And, uh, those cars, like old, when you hit water, they would just hydroplane and I fucking slammed into a tree or a telephone pole. Jesus smashed the car, fucked it up. But everybody wasn't gonna spin. Yeah. Your car, you just, the wheel just goes away and you just, the car just slides. It's super common with old cars, especially if you don't have good tires. But I had a friend who came up to me or he, he told another friend of mine about a fight that we had gotten into where I, I kicked somebody or something like that. And I was like, that never happened. I would, that never happened.

Speaker 4:          01:53:19       But he probably kept telling the story and telling the story, inflating it and getting laughs on it or whatever. You know, I got super into terror management theory recently. Um, it's basically like the guy that, um, uh, Becker, Ernest Becker, um, this is, my dad died a couple of years ago and um, I hadn't really had a lot of death and I started kind of just, I started getting into, and you call it to one time, one day you were like, you're doing too much shit. Like you're doing too much stuff, stop doing so much stuff. And I didn't realize like when you have death in your, basically terror management theory is this is something, you know, of course, but that because we have a prefrontal cortex number, basically the only animal that can ponder the future in the past. Like we know we're going to die and we can't tolerate that anxiety.

Speaker 4:          01:54:01       It's too stressful for us. So we basically have to keep ourselves busy and do meaningless shit. To feel important, you have to win awards. We have to have titles, we have to get things in order to have a sense of immortality. Right. It's basically just managing the anxiety of knowing that we're rotting every day. It's just dying and could die at any moment. It's just like a false sense of control and um, longevity. Um, there's a great book called the warm and the whole Solomon something. Solomon, I read this book and it totally blew my mind cause I realized so many of my behaviors were just about this fear of death because it had been sort of right in front of me so quickly and his death was so freak that it just, it, I had a really hard time coping with the anxiety of death coming so suddenly and so shockingly, and like, um, it fucked me up pretty bad.

Speaker 4:          01:54:51       Um, but I started just making myself busy with super, uh, relevant shit in order to try to cope with that anxiety. And so I got super into terror management theory, terror management theory, terror, like the trying to manage the terror, the daily terror that we know we're gonna die, but the book, yeah, but though it's still through the core. It's something else. It's a less corny cover. The one that I have, but just the name, title, TMT, terror management theory, terror management theory is a little bit controversial I think because it also justifies some like supremacy thinking a lot of I'm better than you and like cultural um, superiority stuff. I'd have to, there's a guy named Solomon that did a talk about it just because you need so badly to feel important that you start to sort of have the delusion that you're better than other people just because you feel so insignificant cause you know you're going to die. You know, we know we're a speck of dust. We know this is all ephemeral and fleeting and that we don't matter. So we have to do things to feel like we matter.

Speaker 6:          01:55:50       Oh that makes sense. Cause we don't, so you sort of exercise your superiority over people. Yeah. In order to shield yourself from the futility of your existence.

Speaker 4:          01:56:00       Yes. And to feel immortal. And you know what I mean, to procreate, the idea of, cause we know our mortality is so present in our Amygdala all day, every day that I'm better than you. Therefore I'm going to procreate more and we are going to sustain and propagate so that we have a sense of lasting ness. That's why we want to make a name for ourselves. That's why we want to get famous, have the tangible things, stuff like that. It drives, it's an anxiety that manifests in materialism. Workaholism needing titles sort of shit like that. Wow.

Speaker 6:          01:56:33       That makes sense. So nasty evil people that subjugate all their employees and yell at everybody and like that's what they're doing. No they're going to die. Wow. They know. But then I even, it's so deep in the subconscious, they have no awareness of why they're behaving the way they behave.

Speaker 4:          01:56:53       It's wild. They've done these studies where, cause I got super into it cause I, I didn't recognize my behavior. I felt like kind of the Zombie. I was like trying to like set up all these TV shows and I was like writing all these movies and I was just like, and I was like, this is so weird because my dad just died. I should know exactly what matters in life, which is none of this shit, achievements or money or any of that. But I was super into like, I got to buy this house and I need to get, you know, this and this thing and this watch. And I was like, this is so not who I am. But it was me trying to cope sort of with all of this anxiety about death. But they did all these studies where they put, um, showed subjects of video and subliminal messaging, put one frame of just the word death in perceptible to the actual eye.

Speaker 4:          01:57:31       And afterwards they showed people pictures of woods or cities and said, where would you rather be? And you'd normally go beautiful woods nature. And they always pick cities cause you just subconsciously felt more scared and wanting to be in a place that was safer. Shit like that. Cities are safer than the woods. I mean just the idea of some protection and you know, lots of civilization. The woods are scary because we're on some level know that we're only superficially at the top of the food chain. You know, if we're out in the woods with a bear and there's no guns or cages, it's we're gonna lose. It's like the idea that we just know how vulnerable we are.

Speaker 6:          01:58:06       That's interesting because I would feel like there's some anxiety attached to the overpopulation aspect to cities for sure. There's gotta be some of that right? Cars and the noise, the noise. We're not designed for that. Right. [inaudible] the fight or flight. We're always in fight or flight mode basically. Do you ever get a chance to go to places where there's no cell phone service and you're in like the legitimate forest? Ari's trying to get me to do the month. No cell phone. Ariza Weirdo. Don't listen to that guy. He's crazy. I'm like, that feels a little extreme. But yeah, he's got the fucking flip phone thing going on. But he's a real junkie. Like he had a problem with food. He was eating candy like all day every day. And I was going, Bro, what are you Dylan? Nah, a few years ago. Yeah, years back. But he was just like, he had a real problem with candy just like Ra develops these things and uh, he would get real obsessed with social media.

Speaker 6:          01:58:58       You know, he was and realized it's fucking addictive. Yeah. I have an addictive personality. I fucking get it. But I'm trying, I'm trying. I'm trying to, I did the, I turn the colors off on the phone. Let me see what it looks like. No I don't have it now because I was fucking posting cause my thing came out today. But they say a lot of the reason it's so addictive is all the colors. So you can put it in gray scale. So it's black and white. There's a phone that they just released as an android phone. That's all in gray scale. It's like in that white paper shit that you get like from a kindle. That's what I need. It's so unbiased. It's so fucking on appealing. You're just like, oh fuck this gross. So I'm trying to do that shit too. Cause it's, it's, I think that we're going to look back at this, the way we look, look at cigarettes.

Speaker 6:          01:59:41       And if I think so too, we're going to be like, people used to use those. I broke my phone in Hawaii last year and uh, it was like three days to get a new one. I had to order one and get it sent to me from the mainland. And you know, I was on vacation and I was a bow hunting. So it was just tracking animals all day with no phone. Which one's in Hawaii? Lanai. Oh cool. I mean what animals access deer. Oh, cool. It's m d of the state of to India. And they're overpopulated in Lanai. There's thousands of them. There's 20,000 deer and 3000 people. You've never seen anything like it. It's fucking crazy. And they have to hunt them. It's like one of the places on the planet where there's a real ethical imperative to, to hunt these animals cause there's no predators.

Speaker 6:          02:00:25       So the only way they control their populations is through hunting. That's the only way. And if there's ever a population they graze and there's no food problem. I mean there's plenty of food. It's a tropical island. But the problem is that you run into this real possibility of disease and you know it's just not good. But the, the point being I was there for a solid three days with no phone and it was this weird feeling of peace. Fuck. It's like, it calmed me down in this weird way. It's like the desire to check. Let me check my email real quick. Let me look at my photos. Which one? Well, I had to post something on Instagram. I'm gonna check my Twitter, see if somebody send me a direct message. Let me see if anybody sent me any pictures that I want to look at.

Speaker 6:          02:01:04       Know like Joey sent me any of his shit. Joey sent me La something that is so it's like such an obvious solution, but I realized so much of going to the phone is to check time and we have to, it's like the new pocket watch and then once you go to look at the time, then you see your text message and you know what I mean? Wear a watch. I don't and I need to, it was just where I'm going to start to wear a watch and then also getting a separate camera cause so much of what we do is to take pictures. It's like, Oh I got to take pictures of this and then I'm on my phone. These, this with a flip phone. Woo Pig Paul. I know my heart just

Speaker 2:          02:01:40       stopped me a second. I'm not going to post on Instagram with a flip phone. Him Yelling on tick tock tick tock tick, tick tock. Oh I know about it from my kids. They do the tick. Don't know what it is. It's like live streaming dancing. From what I understand, I know it only from Christina's page cause she puts on some, oh it started as a music app called musically. It changed the name to Tiktaalik and people just dancing. It's a lot of kids. Kids are all over it but you don't want to talk or be funny. It's now become what vine was, but it's still based around music. It wasn't vine only like five seconds. This is a little bit longer, but there's a lot of songs over the last year that have gotten popular off there, including like old town road, which was the number one song got popular off of there.

Speaker 2:          02:02:21       That's how it got popular. Yeah. Wow. Well I've got popular with my kids for sure. My kids knew about that song way before me. They were singing it. You never see that there's a video of little nas x, whatever his name is at a school and he's on stage and these kids are seeing along. It is fucking adorable. They're all singing along to the song. It's really cute. Good Song. He's doing well mentally partner thing and what was this? The controversy. They wouldn't let the song be on the country charts. That was the big controversy race. That's fucking racist. That's all it is. That is like God damn country song and not Garth Brooks, that other Guy Cyrus is oddly ray. Yeah, well they, once they put him on then it, they allowed it on the country charts. He wasn't in the original version, so they had to put him on it and then it made me, am I wrong about that?

Speaker 2:          02:03:11       You are correct, but who do you hoodie was this hunt country singer? Yes. But he started out as a regular singer and then came over to country. His career kind of fell apart as was a pot and the bloke fish went away. Derrius Rutger? Yes. Thank you. He's really good. Was fucking got a beautiful voice and all the things I remember and he maybe he just, that's his shit. He's into it. But his career was floundering in the other world and then he went into the world of Hay and flannel and they took off. I fucking drive home to a lot of his music hall. I don't know why that Hootie and the blowfish was a legit jam. I wonder why they didn't last right there on to Oregon right now who didn't get it back. I was going to say about Aaron Lewis. Ms Stand also is a country singer. Oh, he's in a huge country. So anyway, he's got, he wears mag hats and he's got don't tread on me tattooed on his neck. That was like during the time of him nice guy were like, all the bands were like, Huh? Like there was like a [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          02:04:14       There was a moment where that's what all the music sound like and maybe that just like trained toad, the wet sprocket. Yeah. That's all that. Like the fucking, they was just got sick of it. The band. But Pearl Jam, they're all pearl jam phones best. That's what it is. They all totally. Um, but yeah, I think your phone a better man. Such a good song. Yeah, it's great song. I love the sound so good. I mean that is so crazy. When I think about that Jeremy Spoken Song, I had no idea. Like it was so weird when it came out. I had no concept of what it even fucking meant. I was listening, it was on mixed the other day and I was like, God, what was it about suicide? Didn't it? Was it about a kid that, that blew his head off in Jeremy's spoken class today? I think he blew his brains out in class member that videos for consider story.

Speaker 2:          02:05:09       It's about suicide. Jesus used to make out to a suicide song. I had no idea what he was even about. There's a lot of really McCobb shit going on back down with music. Remember that was that silver chair? Remember that silver chair video rape me about that? Literally forgot about it until just this moment rape me. My friend used to dance to it. She used to drink to it, smoke weed to it. We used to sing along. If it was on ticktack now we'd be singing along to it. What a crazy fucking wild. Who would be the Kurt Cobain of t like what? That was such a big deal. Like who?

Speaker 3:          02:05:44       They can't have that with the Internet. They would, someone would meet to them. They'd find out shit about 'em. There'd be a dick pic. Yep. People get angry. I mean he had poor judgment. He dated Courtney love. He married her. Right.

Speaker 2:          02:05:55       But like when he killed himself, definitely taken pictures of his dog. Who's that big right now? Who's that big of a star? There's so many stars now. I think we've diluted the pool and there are so many stars we've never heard of. It used to be like there was a star we all knew about were old funk. That's part of the people that someone, I'm like, Oh, who's that person? They have 70 million followers. I'm like, I've never heard of um, what? Yeah, what? Yeah, we're out of the loop. I'm way more out of the loop than you. He's more in the loop than both of us. Do you think that changes in a couple of weeks when they take the follower accounts off of like the [inaudible] was only in Australia. They're testing it in other countries before they drop it here.

Speaker 3:          02:06:37       That looks like it looks like fucking like they try drugs out in other countries to shine out the follower count thing. What? That's going to be weird. Wonder what, how people go. Why are they doing that? Because they feel like they're doing a disservice to people by having them compete.

Speaker 2:          02:06:53       Psychology has it. Yeah. Yeah. You won't be seeing other people's stuff. So it might tell a lot of people make money. I know, not me. I don't ever do ads on Instagram, but a lot of people do. I don't either. I bet you get offered to do a ton of shit a lot. But I say no because you just think it's corny. Yeah, I'll do ads ads

Speaker 3:          02:07:08       for things I like where um, I put it up for free. Yeah. But I've never been paid. Yeah. Like if someone said, oh it's fucking owed. Like maybe it is an ad but it's not an ad I'm getting paid for. Like if I find something that's cool I'll just put it up like this is a bad ass little video. This is how much I think it helps. And I've, I've been offered a lot of money multiple times to do ads for things on Instagram and I'm like, look, I do ads my podcast, everybody knows it's an ad. Yeah. If I'm doing, I'm not doing that on Instagram. I'm just, that doesn't seem like it makes sense. Like if someone goes to your Instagram, they want to see cool shit that you're interested in, they want to see a picture of something. I want to see a picture of my dog or food or fucking sunset or a mountain or whatever the fuck it is. They don't want to see sneakers that your salad unless it's like, but if it's a friend of mine sneakers and he sell them, I'll take a picture of that and put it up, but I don't want any money.

Speaker 4:          02:08:01       I think it feels Corny, you know? I think for you especially, I think people trust you so much and you're known for telling the truth and not selling out. If you had a Hashtag ad everyone was like, what? Like it just feels paid ads. Well, it's like your thing. It would just be like, make a good product. I'll post about it. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:08:19       For free all the time. Yeah. I really do. And people, I don't even know if they have something cool, I'll put it up.

Speaker 4:          02:08:24       Yeah. Have you ever felt like, oh fuck, that's a lot of money. No, it's not worth it because you probably lose in the long run.

Speaker 3:          02:08:32       Yeah. It's like if I was poor, yeah, I would do it. Yeah. If I was poor, I'd do it. I did fear factor. Fuck, I'll do a lot of horse shit. That's not, I'm not above whoring myself, but I'm not going to whore myself if I have money. No, that doesn't make any sense.

Speaker 4:          02:08:46       But that is weird cause I wonder how people are gonna a lot of people make money from putting ads on Instagram. Just delete it. I did not, it's not related directly to this, but they deleted a bunch of accounts apparently yesterday count's had had up to 13 million followers. Really? Meme accounts and shit. The whole account for their book. A couple of reasons they might have done it like with a lot of meme accounts that steal jokes

Speaker 3:          02:09:07       a lot. A lot hot la

Speaker 4:          02:09:11       crazy me. Just make money off of it. There was a girl you saw that girl on a, is it meg? Right? Who was calling out that a fuck Jerry Guy who was just doing comics jokes. It was out. His name was may, I don't know Mike. Right? Oh she was a uh, comic comedy person. Yeah. Oh, who bake comedy writer. Yeah. And who was just like connecting the comics joke to the meme.

Speaker 3:          02:09:32       So many that were at least they slowed down like the progress of that fat Jewish guy that's slowed down. He doesn't have nearly the sort of trajectory he used to have, but that was all what he was about. It's just like taking people's Shit and repurposing it and making a lot of money and then also like getting on television shows, being interviewed and not having a fucking talent at all. Just reposting. Yeah,

Speaker 4:          02:09:55       I know I people DM me all the time, Hey, can I act now that everyone's scared that, can I use your tweet in my Instagram for you getting now I have to do work to say yes so you can upper, you know it's just like, but yeah, a lot of people are like curators I think is what they call it. Is that why they deleted them? Right. For coffee. But article had said that there's like they could have been taking advertising money and not saying it and I'm like cutting in at a Instagram's advertising deals, reposting people, Shit, all that. All that end of articles said that there is no way they can get those accounts back. There's, it's like non-negotiable. Oh Shit. Oh fuck off. But so we'll to basically go, everyone's going to have no followers. You won't be able to see it. You'll be able to see your account. Like you'll know that you still have it

Speaker 2:          02:10:34       every day I'm going to post an Instagram photo of my account. I got people are going to get their Nas bitches recognize cause like, I mean people are fucking falling off cliffs taking selfies. Have you seen it? It's like the fucking Darwin Award. You'll still be able to see the likes. You just won't be able to see your followers yet either. None of it. You'll be able to see how many likes you have on your photos. Wow. I'm going to pull your a screen, grab it and posted. I'm going up my, my, what I'll do is I'll post something in the morning and then three times throughout the day I'll post it to see which, how many likes I got to everybody. That's for sure going to happen. Gangster moved though. Instagram would be so mad at you. You're fucked by bypassing like showing your like some movement on your Twitter account.

Speaker 2:          02:11:15       Yeah. Oh that's the move posted on my Twitter account posted on my Facebook cause that's a dumpster. If Facebook's a dumpster, I just, I don't even look good. Yeah, I mean just dump things over there. Yeah. It doesn't yours just connect to it. Like it just automatically posts. But it's interesting because it's clearly reflects my lack of interaction because like I only have 2 million Facebook followers whereas like everything else is way more than that whole engagement thing now. So there was this I social media is this to its full time job. So I was talking to much people to run my social media and they're like, well you have to engage people to all to get in the algorithm. Now you have to ask, you have to ask questions so that people like you notice it. Celebrities for a while kept going like, so what are you doing this weekend?

Speaker 2:          02:11:55       Like as if just thought they were dumb. Like what do you like to cook on, you know, Taco night. Like, oh it was all these like insincere questions cause they wanted people to answer so they could get into the algorithm. Oh, that makes sense. I read one that said, what's your least favorite chore? What in the fuck are you? What are you, it's the amount of robots. If you can't, um, if you, if you, by the way, the shot of this is so funny cause she just looks like a dead body done with us. She checked out, she was with us for awhile now our neck. Fuck she's off. Oh cause I didn't have her on chat cause she kept stealing my thunder and distracting your back bitch there. She's back. [inaudible] over here. Hey that bitch, um, I gotta end this. I gotta be at the comedy store in two hours. Oh fuck am I gotta go home and hug my kids. You have to go parents. All right. We comings your new Netflix special available right fucking now don't worry about following me cause followers don't matter anymore. Do not matter. Don't like any of our like doesn't mean anything. All right, bye. Everybody go resuscitate this robot.

Speaker 10:         02:13:06       Okay.

Speaker 2:          02:13:10       [inaudible].
