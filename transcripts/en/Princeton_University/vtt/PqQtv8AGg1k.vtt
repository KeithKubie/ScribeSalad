Chris Herzog:
I'm Chris Herzog. I'm an assistant professor
in the physics department. Last year, I ran

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:17.180 position:81%
Chris Herzog:
the first Princeton science playwriting competition.
This year, I'd like to invite you to listen

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:23.050 position:72%
Chris Herzog:
to the winning entries. We’re going to have
a staged reading on Monday, Oct. 17 at 8 p.m.,

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.449
Chris Herzog:
in Taplin Auditorium.

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:30.399 position:75%
Erisa Apantaku:
I got the idea for "A Quantum Comedy" last
year in Integrated Science, when we were talking

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:34.790 position:73%
Erisa Apantaku:
about concepts such as Heisenberg’s uncertainty
principle. I wrote about two guys in a dorm

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.079 position:66%
Erisa Apantaku:
room and I thought that was something that
every college student could relate to.

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:41.920 position:66%
Minqi Jiang:
So I wrote my play about the "Many Worlds"
interpretation of quantum mechanics, which

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.460 position:73%
Minqi Jiang:
states that whenever an action entails multiple
possible outcomes, the universe splits into

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.000 position:75%
Minqi Jiang:
different versions of itself, one to accommodate
each possible outcome.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.600 position:75%
Lily Yu:
Wu Chien-Shiung was a Chinese-American physicist
famous for violating the law of parity in

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.150 position:77%
Lily Yu:
1953 in an elegant experiment at the national
bureau of standards in D.C. She came to Princeton

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.489 position:64%
Lily Yu:
in 1943 as the first female instructor in
the physics department, although she left

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:09.500 position:80%
Lily Yu:
for Columbia and the Manhattan Project the
next year. What I wrote is a compressed, surrealist

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.729 position:88%
Lily Yu:
interpretation of her life up until the 1953 experiment.

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:16.359 position:66%
Chris Herzog:
People are often turned off, I think, from
physics and math because they think it’s

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:19.840 position:70%
Chris Herzog:
too hard. One thing that’s kept me going
is the idea that if it were really that hard,

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.950 position:72%
Chris Herzog:
then no one would understand it. The fault was
somehow in a poor explanation. Science plays,

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:30.149 position:72%
Chris Herzog:
I think, are a way of getting around this
problem. By definition, they excite and engage

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:34.729 position:69%
Chris Herzog:
the audience, and ultimately, if they reach
some higher artistic level, they convey some

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:35.149
Chris Herzog:
deeper truth.
