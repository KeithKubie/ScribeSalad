MALE SPEAKER: It's a
great pleasure for me

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.450
to introduce Betsy Brown
Braun to you guys today.

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:11.120
Betsy's a child development
and behavior specialist,

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.470
a parenting consultant, a
multiple-birth parenting

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:18.350
consultant, and the founder
of Parenting Pathways, Inc.

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:20.030
I think most people
probably know her

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:21.655
primarily as an author.

00:00:21.655 --> 00:00:23.280
That's how I first
learned about Betsy.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.600
She has two books, "Just
Tell Me What to Say"

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.840
and "You're Not the Boss
of Me," both bestsellers.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.640
We have some copies of each here
today, so hopefully most of you

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.100
got a chance to get one.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.950
They're great books.

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.600
They're really practical
tips and scripts

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.095
for every sort of
parenting situation

00:00:42.095 --> 00:00:43.266
you might find yourself in.

00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:44.640
In fact, I think
that's literally

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.390
one of the subtitles
for one of the books.

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.900
She's also been involved
in elementary and childhood

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:57.760
education for over 40
years, is a mom to triplets.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:58.600
Right, Betsy?

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.470
Yeah.

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.030
My wife and I first met
Betsy almost two years ago

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:05.510
after reading her books.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.010
We found out that she's actually
local, lives in the Pacific

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.880
Palisades, and she leads groups.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.070
She leads parenting group
sessions, seminars, and also

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.410
individual parenting sessions.

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:18.940
And so my wife and I attended
a couple of the seminars.

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.830
One of them was called
"Elementary School,

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:21.930
Here I Come."

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.704
And just been an
invaluable resource

00:01:23.704 --> 00:01:26.120
in part of the process for
getting our five-year-old ready

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.896
for kindergarten
later this year.

00:01:27.896 --> 00:01:29.270
And then we doubled
down and went

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.480
to the safety seminar,
which is also great.

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:34.980
Still trying to get
into discipline.

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.030
Every time I've tried to
register for the discipline

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.220
seminar, it's been sold out.

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.800
So, I'm hopeful that this
will help me to get a spot--

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:41.420
BETSY BROWN BRAUN: April 29th.

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.378
MALE SPEAKER: --at the
next discipline seminar.

00:01:43.378 --> 00:01:45.039
OK, good.

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:46.580
So without any
further ado, I'm going

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.786
to introduce Betsy
Brown Braun, everyone.

00:01:48.786 --> 00:01:50.124
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:50.124 --> 00:01:51.910
BETSY BROWN BRAUN: Thank you.

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.215
I'm so not a clapping
sort of person.

00:01:54.215 --> 00:01:56.342
They wanted me to
stand on stage.

00:01:56.342 --> 00:01:57.300
I don't do that either.

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.140
I'm a mom, and I'm
among my people.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.370
So I like to speak
to you that way.

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.380
I was happy when Dan
asked me to come and speak

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.670
to you, because this is an
organization that I have

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.930
a lot of-- organization,
workplace-- about which I have

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.870
a lot of preconceived notions.

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.340
And I imagined
you'd all be wearing

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.550
those-- like he has on--
and that you'd all be,

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.950
a lot of pens in your pockets,
and all that sort of thing.

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.592
But I'm glad to see
perfectly normal people here.

00:02:26.592 --> 00:02:27.800
So let me ask you a question.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.560
I really want to
ask each of you,

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.440
but we don't have time,
how old your kids are

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.606
and where they go to school.

00:02:32.606 --> 00:02:37.182
So am I correct if I make the
assumption that the youngest

00:02:37.182 --> 00:02:39.640
kids we have-- we probably have
some infants, and toddlers,

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.500
and nursery schoolers.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.490
And elementary schoolers.

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.129
Do we have any teens?

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:46.670
There you go.

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.451
Young company, young people.

00:02:48.451 --> 00:02:48.950
Got it.

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.000
OK, so at least I know-- by the
way, thank goodness for you--

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.930
and at least I know
what my audience is.

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:57.780
Let me ask you this
question, though.

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.903
Did any of your parents
go to parenting seminars?

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:04.300
Right?

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:05.040
Go to bed, now!

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.540
Right?

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.510
It was that sort of thing.

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.100
Life has really changed.

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.910
Aside from all the Google
stuff, life has really changed.

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.290
From a sociological
perspective, life

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.340
has changed because people are
getting married much older.

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.450
People are having babies
before they get married.

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.960
People have different
kinds of relationships.

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:36.460
The definition of family
continues to evolve.

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:39.010
Very often, more often
than not, both parents

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.730
have a career going before
they begin a family.

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.870
Or at least one parent does.

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.750
And you young people today
have a taste for what you want.

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.090
And you have goals, and
this is what you plan to do.

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.630
I laugh about this
because I actually

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:00.680
have parents who come to visit
me and see me about schools.

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:01.590
This really happened.

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.430
A couple sat down on
my couch and said,

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.030
just tell me the nursery
school that my kid should

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.090
go to so I can get him into
the best elementary school,

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.930
so I can get him into
the best high school,

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.592
so I can get him into-- fill in
the blank, whatever college you

00:04:17.592 --> 00:04:18.550
want your kid to go to.

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:20.529
And I laugh, and I
think, yeah, right.

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:21.490
And by the way,
they're just going

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:22.590
to come home and live with you.

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.130
He's going to come home
and live with you anyway,

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:25.380
because no one's getting jobs.

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.250
You're not from
India, so forget it.

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:33.120
But what's happened
is, parents, you

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.890
have a clear taste-- you
have a clear idea of what

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:39.720
you want for your kids,
what you hope will happen.

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.506
And parenting gets attacked
like it's another career.

00:04:44.506 --> 00:04:45.880
You do everything
you need to do,

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.540
and you come to see
Betsy for school.

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:48.500
And you're having
trouble with this,

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:49.740
and you come and see Betsy.

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.250
I didn't have a Betsy.

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.490
I was 22 years old
when I got married.

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.630
Wouldn't you plotz if your
kid got married at 22?

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:57.540
Crazy.

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:00.930
I wasn't even done
growing at 22.

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:02.790
And I had my kids
when I was 30, which

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:04.820
is still considered young.

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:06.790
Which doesn't make
sense biologically,

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:09.810
because we're already
going downhill after 25.

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:11.080
Oh, that's another seminar.

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.580
Forget it.

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.680
OK.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:18.500
So this is as much
about the parent

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.640
as it is about the child.

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.170
Parenting, what I do, child
development and behavior

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:23.867
specialist.

00:05:23.867 --> 00:05:25.200
It's not really about the child.

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.116
It's really about you.

00:05:26.116 --> 00:05:30.430
You have so much to do
with how this goes for you.

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:33.350
We live in this
new era where there

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:35.830
is a new sport
that is king, and I

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:39.590
call that sport
competitive parenting.

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:42.655
And we all giggle when I say
that, but you know it's true.

00:05:42.655 --> 00:05:44.970
We do live in that.

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:48.550
We all have goals for our
kids, but we're not really sure

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:51.700
how to make them happen.

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:54.730
I think it's incredibly
ironic that when you're

00:05:54.730 --> 00:06:00.720
pregnant we say, you're
expecting, because-- someone

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:04.243
laugh, because that's really
good-- because your baby is

00:06:04.243 --> 00:06:05.630
born and you're expecting.

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:07.630
You're expecting this
one will be an artist.

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:09.220
And this one will
be a soccer player.

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:10.780
And this one will
be good at tap.

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:13.040
And this one will do
underwater basket weaving.

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:16.870
And you've got all these plans
you're expecting for your kid.

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:19.680
And then, your child
is born, and it's

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:23.140
like, oops, I guess he
won't be playing basketball.

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:26.020
Or oops, I guess he'd
better play basketball,

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:28.180
or whatever it would be.

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:32.194
We don't want our kids
to miss out on anything.

00:06:32.194 --> 00:06:33.360
We would be you, by the way.

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:33.860
I'm done.

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:36.400
My kids are 36, and
they're fully cooked.

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:39.110
Actually, I take that back.

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:42.510
Because what I really know
now-- I'm a granny of three.

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:43.640
Each of my kids is married.

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:45.130
Each has one baby.

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:48.970
And I know that there is no
expiration date on parenting.

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:50.714
It just doesn't ever stop.

00:06:50.714 --> 00:06:51.880
Different, but doesn't stop.

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:54.570
So I take that back.

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:57.080
But you don't want your kids
to miss out on anything.

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:00.180
We want them to all
have the options

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:02.180
to do whatever it
is they need to do.

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:04.830
And as a result of that,
we make sure that they

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:06.880
can do everything.

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:09.580
You take your two-year-old
to soccer skills classes.

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:10.850
By the way, why?

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:11.930
But you do.

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:13.515
Or it's not really soccer.

00:07:13.515 --> 00:07:14.470
It's ball skills.

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:14.970
Why?

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:16.170
They have no eye-hand.

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:18.280
What are you doing
with a two-year-old?

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:20.560
Or we now sign kids
up for soccer at four.

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:21.060
Why?

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:22.560
They can't do team sports.

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:25.460
They're like a little beehive
when they run around the field.

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:26.500
It's crazy, right?

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:27.300
They have art.

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:28.280
They have yoga.

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:30.446
They have all this stuff
for these little bitty kids

00:07:30.446 --> 00:07:33.342
when all they really need
to be doing is playing.

00:07:33.342 --> 00:07:35.550
Because that's what children
need when they're young,

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:38.700
because play is the
work of childhood.

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:40.730
It is the business of childhood.

00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:43.560
It's more important,
given safety and health,

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:45.270
than anything else.

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:46.900
But I digress.

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:49.069
So it's kind of like
a race, this becomes.

00:07:49.069 --> 00:07:51.610
Hurry, get my kid into this and
this and this nursery school.

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:52.780
And it's crazy.

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:54.220
You know what I'm talking about.

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:59.010
And what happens is that we're
so busy scheduling our kids'

00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:02.490
lives, giving them all the
things we think they're

00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:06.520
supposed to do, that
we're kind of forgetting

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:09.100
to look at the child and
see where the child comes

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:10.140
into this.

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:12.530
And we're not
necessarily doing what

00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:16.020
that particular child needs.

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:20.180
Here's what hasn't changed.

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:24.390
Maybe parenting, the way in
which we parent, has changed.

00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:27.970
But what hasn't changed
is what children need.

00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:31.160
Nothing has changed
in that realm.

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.789
Kids need to feel safe.

00:08:33.789 --> 00:08:36.380
They need to feel connected.

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:41.289
They need to feel that they
are significant in your life.

00:08:41.289 --> 00:08:45.270
They need to feel that
they are part a whole team,

00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:48.720
and that that whole
team is a safety net.

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:53.650
Of this, I am abundantly sure
and clear that kids need that.

00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:57.510
They also need-- and this
hasn't changed, ever.

00:08:57.510 --> 00:08:59.920
Socrates would say the same.

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:02.280
They need to have
the traits, or shall

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:05.770
we say skills, the
traits of character

00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:08.920
that enable them to
grow up and become

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:12.910
self-reliant, and
resilient, and honest,

00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:14.980
and good citizens in the world.

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:16.500
That won't happen by accident.

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:17.940
There are actually
traits that we

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:19.420
need to instill in our children.

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:23.370
And that's kind of what this,
my second book, is about.

00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:25.300
And I will talk to you
about the difference

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:28.800
in the books in a minute, but
that's why I wrote that book.

00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:36.950
What else hasn't changed
is child development.

00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:40.330
Children still develop
in the same way

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:41.800
that they have always developed.

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:43.750
There is a particular path.

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:48.460
Now, I fully believe that all
of you have kids who are gifted.

00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:49.690
You live in West LA.

00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:51.650
It kind of goes
with the property.

00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:53.180
You have a gifted child.

00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:53.810
I know.

00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:57.050
But the fact remains,
that all hu--

00:09:57.050 --> 00:10:00.770
you'd be surprised how
many people call and say,

00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:03.620
kind of shyly, well,
my kid is gifted.

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:04.800
And I want to laugh.

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:05.820
My kid's really smart.

00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:08.192
And I say, let me guess,
he's gifted, right?

00:10:08.192 --> 00:10:10.240
It's your job to think
your kid is gifted.

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:10.970
And he might be.

00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:13.950
2% of the population is.

00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:17.330
The fact remains that all
human beings, when born,

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:20.170
have to go through a series
of predictable stages

00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:24.430
of development in every single
realm, one before the other,

00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:28.310
one foot in front of the
other, in order to grow up.

00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:32.130
Cognitively, socially,
emotionally, physically,

00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:34.210
large muscle, and small muscle.

00:10:34.210 --> 00:10:35.540
They must go through them.

00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:39.010
You don't get to just start your
kid here and say, OK, buddy,

00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:39.785
run.

00:10:39.785 --> 00:10:40.410
You've seen it.

00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:42.450
It doesn't work that way.

00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:46.150
And while it may happen
at different times

00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:50.950
for different kids, the
progression remains the same.

00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:53.446
I laugh when I see
parents-- there

00:10:53.446 --> 00:10:55.820
was this thing a while ago
where parents were doing flash

00:10:55.820 --> 00:11:00.199
cards for kids, babies, holding
up the word cow every one

00:11:00.199 --> 00:11:00.990
minute, every hour.

00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:02.901
Cow, cow, cow.

00:11:02.901 --> 00:11:04.900
And pretty soon, the kid
looks up and goes, cow.

00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:07.490
Whatever, he can't even
talk, but he's going, cow.

00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:09.800
As if that's going to
mean the child is reading.

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:13.080
There's so much that has
to happen, cognitively,

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:14.700
developmentally,
in a child for him

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:16.760
to get to any one
of these stages.

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:18.909
But we're so busy planning
their little lives

00:11:18.909 --> 00:11:20.950
that they don't get to
pass through those stages.

00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:23.100
Because we're too busy
doing underwater basket

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:25.005
weaving when they should
be climbing trees.

00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:31.020
The child has to be in balance.

00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:34.000
Everything needs to
develop and grow.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.880
Because we want our
kids to be in balance.

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:38.330
Here's a good example.

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:39.970
I've been the director
at many schools.

00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:42.297
I opened a very large school.

00:11:42.297 --> 00:11:44.130
I've done a lot of
teaching, all that stuff.

00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:47.930
And once I had a child-- I was
directing a nursery school.

00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:50.030
Nursery school and preschool
are the same thing.

00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:52.220
I just don't like
the word preschool.

00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:53.080
I had a child.

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:53.789
Mother came in.

00:11:53.789 --> 00:11:54.330
He was three.

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:57.786
And she said, Betsy,
my child is really--

00:11:57.786 --> 00:11:58.494
AUDIENCE: Gifted?

00:11:58.494 --> 00:11:59.994
BETSY BROWN BRAUN:
Yeah, definitely.

00:11:59.994 --> 00:12:02.440
And I said, great, I'm
sure you're really happy.

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:04.830
Well, I really want him to
be in the four-year-old class

00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:05.712
because he's really--

00:12:05.712 --> 00:12:06.420
AUDIENCE: Gifted?

00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:07.960
BETSY BROWN BRAUN: Yeah.

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:10.676
I looked at this woman, and
I thought, I am not stupid.

00:12:10.676 --> 00:12:12.300
I'm not going to
argue with this woman.

00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:13.417
I don't care.

00:12:13.417 --> 00:12:15.000
I'm going to let her
fall on her face.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.060
So after she was convincing
me that are kid was gifted,

00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:22.230
I said, you know what,
let's give it a try.

00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:25.750
So I took this
little, tiny, pencil

00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:28.470
of a three-year-old,
this sweet little monkey,

00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:29.970
and he went into
the four-year-olds.

00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:32.240
Now, how many of you
have four-year-olds?

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:34.000
OK, four-year-olds, right?

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.470
The f-ing fours.

00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:36.466
They're monsters.

00:12:36.466 --> 00:12:38.046
[IMPERSONATING MONSTER]

00:12:38.046 --> 00:12:39.720
They're crazy, four-year-olds.

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:41.470
Three-nagers, f-ing
four-year-olds.

00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:42.130
You got it.

00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:42.810
OK.

00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:45.870
So this little boy goes into
the four-year-old class,

00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:50.390
looks around, crawls
under the table.

00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:52.880
Second day, he comes
to school, plays

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:55.220
a little while, crawls
under the table.

00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:57.170
We went through
approximately seven

00:12:57.170 --> 00:13:00.140
or eight school days of
crawling under the table.

00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:03.110
And then he came out a little
while, but the end of the story

00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:05.370
is, three weeks later, the
mother came to me and said,

00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:05.870
I'm wrong.

00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:07.570
He should be with
the three-year-olds.

00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:08.340
Ah.

00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:12.020
Because socially, and
emotionally, and physically,

00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:13.520
he wasn't ready.

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:16.290
It doesn't matter how
gifted your child is.

00:13:16.290 --> 00:13:19.860
Children need to be in balance.

00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:22.210
And this is not
something you can hurry.

00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:24.450
Every child is born
with a timetable,

00:13:24.450 --> 00:13:26.950
and we've got to move them along
in the way they're supposed

00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:29.200
to move-- he is
supposed to move.

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:32.580
Let's talk for a minute about
that connectedness thing

00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:35.940
I referred to when I talked
about what kids need.

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:38.280
It sounds really obvious, right?

00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:39.060
It sounds simple.

00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:40.934
Well, of course, your
kid's connected to you.

00:13:40.934 --> 00:13:41.730
Came from my body.

00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:42.330
He loves me.

00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:44.630
I love him.

00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:48.220
Not automatic,
and not so simple.

00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:50.740
And what's so important
about connectedness?

00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:56.460
Well, let me say that when
a child feels connected--

00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:58.610
feels connected--
to his parents,

00:13:58.610 --> 00:14:01.690
when he feels that he is
significant in his parents'

00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:05.270
lives, when he
feels like he makes

00:14:05.270 --> 00:14:09.440
a difference in your life,
he's going to be a good kid.

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:10.800
It's as simple as that.

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:12.430
Not really.

00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:16.330
In order to put your kids
in a position of wanting

00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:22.040
to cooperate, in wanting
to do what you ask,

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:25.840
in wanting them to not do what
you don't want them to do--

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:29.710
because we know discipline is
either, don't do that, or do

00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:30.580
do that.

00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:32.260
Kind of the end of
the story there.

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:35.790
The child needs to feel that
he and you are connected.

00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:39.320
Because that feeling
activates in him

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:41.150
a desire to be a good kid.

00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:45.280
But if you're on opposing teams,
when you're on opposite teams,

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:48.390
the impulse to fight
is so strong in a child

00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:49.920
that he's going
to go against you.

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:51.180
And that's activated.

00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:52.170
We all have that.

00:14:52.170 --> 00:14:53.730
We all have the
fight-or-flight thing

00:14:53.730 --> 00:14:58.550
in our sweet little brains,
in our primitive brains.

00:14:58.550 --> 00:15:01.870
And that's there in
your children, too.

00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:05.210
When your child feels
connected, the opposite happens,

00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:08.540
and the impulse to
please you is activated.

00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:11.060
So how do we encourage that
sense of connectedness?

00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:13.470
Because it's not
just going to happen.

00:15:13.470 --> 00:15:16.005
You actually already know the
answer to this, presumably,

00:15:16.005 --> 00:15:17.430
because you all have kids.

00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:20.880
Or I'm assuming everybody
who's here has a kid.

00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:23.310
First of all I say, spend
time with your child.

00:15:23.310 --> 00:15:25.290
And that sounds so silly
because, of course,

00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:26.160
you spend time.

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:27.890
But you're all here.

00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:30.940
So that means you have this
much time at this end of the day

00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:33.860
and this much time at
this end of the day.

00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:36.560
And you also have your
houses, and your laundry,

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:38.350
and your family,
and your cooking,

00:15:38.350 --> 00:15:39.870
and whatever else
you have to do.

00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:42.670
So it's really hard to
spend time with your kids.

00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:45.800
And you don't get to just
spend time on the weekends.

00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:47.730
This is like putting
money in the bank.

00:15:47.730 --> 00:15:48.840
Drip, drip, drip.

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:50.550
The drip method of parenting.

00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:53.130
There needs to be
something every day.

00:15:53.130 --> 00:15:56.180
And what I'm saying is,
do fun stuff together.

00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:58.380
Don't do stuff where you're
telling him what to do,

00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:00.650
or you're taking
care of errands,

00:16:00.650 --> 00:16:02.850
or you're checking
things off the list.

00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:05.870
Kids feel attached to you
when you're doing stuff

00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:09.020
where you're not commenting,
criticizing, judging,

00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:11.220
directing, telling
them what to do.

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:15.700
Sit down on the floor
and say, oh, LEGOs.

00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:19.500
Or do stickers, or play
with dolls or puppets.

00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:23.150
But just be with your child,
because that message says,

00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:24.090
I want to be with you.

00:16:24.090 --> 00:16:25.740
You are important to me.

00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:27.990
One of the mistakes I think
parents make, by the way,

00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:31.070
is trying to fit the
child into your world.

00:16:31.070 --> 00:16:34.160
And I mean this for when
your kids get older.

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:36.300
You need to fit into
your kid's world.

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:39.380
If you don't know anything about
LEGOs, you better find out.

00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:42.815
If your kid loves baseball,
and you've never--

00:16:42.815 --> 00:16:44.050
you need to get into it.

00:16:44.050 --> 00:16:46.540
You need to join your
child in his world.

00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:50.520
It's not his job to join
you in your world, yet.

00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:52.190
OK.

00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:54.740
Have real conversations
with your children.

00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:57.290
Now I realize that only a couple
of you have four-year-olds,

00:16:57.290 --> 00:16:59.260
and so there's
probably-- when you're

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:01.990
talking about how you
talk to kids when they're

00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:04.371
teenagers, that's a lot easier.

00:17:04.371 --> 00:17:06.329
But I'll tell you the
story of a client of mine

00:17:06.329 --> 00:17:11.329
who had a little boy, age
seven, who said to her, Mom,

00:17:11.329 --> 00:17:12.661
you never talk to me.

00:17:12.661 --> 00:17:15.119
And she looked at him and said,
what are you talking about?

00:17:15.119 --> 00:17:16.740
I always talk to you.

00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:18.250
He said, no, you
never talk to me.

00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:19.520
She said, don't be silly.

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:20.928
I talk to you all the time.

00:17:20.928 --> 00:17:21.719
He said, you don't.

00:17:21.719 --> 00:17:22.890
You don't talk to me.

00:17:22.890 --> 00:17:24.710
She said, what are
you talking about?

00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:25.430
I talk to you.

00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:26.180
We're talking now.

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:28.410
He said, no, you
don't talk to me

00:17:28.410 --> 00:17:30.750
like the way you talk to Dad.

00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:32.300
He said, when you
talk to Dad-- I

00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:33.230
know what you're imagining here.

00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:34.040
I don't mean that.

00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:37.620
When you talk to Dad,
first Dad says something,

00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:41.100
and then you say something,
and then Dad says something,

00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:42.730
and then you say something.

00:17:42.730 --> 00:17:44.190
And he said, yeah.

00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:46.080
She said, well, that's
having a conversation.

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:47.663
He said, we don't
have a conversation.

00:17:47.663 --> 00:17:50.846
You're just always telling
me what I have to do next.

00:17:50.846 --> 00:17:53.727
I thought that was
pretty heady stuff.

00:17:53.727 --> 00:17:55.560
That's what I mean,
connect with your child.

00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:57.450
Stop directing and
telling, we got to do this.

00:17:57.450 --> 00:17:57.850
Hurry up.

00:17:57.850 --> 00:17:58.300
We're going to be late.

00:17:58.300 --> 00:17:58.883
Get to school.

00:17:58.883 --> 00:18:01.020
Get to the babysitter.

00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:02.800
We need to connect
with our children.

00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:06.710
They need to feel like what
they say is important to you,

00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:09.780
makes a difference,
that you hear them.

00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:14.440
Your job is to be a container
for your child's feelings.

00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:16.450
So when your child comes
to you and tells you

00:18:16.450 --> 00:18:22.620
something, most people, men--
sorry men, but it is true.

00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:25.000
When your child comes
and tells you something,

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.350
you try to fix it.

00:18:26.350 --> 00:18:28.430
Because that's what guys do.

00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:33.290
And women-- less so, but when
it's your child, we do it.

00:18:33.290 --> 00:18:35.170
Ladies, when you sit
down with a partner,

00:18:35.170 --> 00:18:37.690
and you say, oh my god, let me
tell you what happened today,

00:18:37.690 --> 00:18:38.360
da, da, da, da.

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:41.590
And your partner says,
well did you try this?

00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:43.090
And I want to say,
no, just listen.

00:18:43.090 --> 00:18:43.630
Don't talk.

00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:45.090
Just listen to
what I have to say.

00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:46.700
Your kids are kind
of the same way.

00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:48.780
They don't always
want to be told

00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:51.940
what they should have done,
or what they should try.

00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:54.300
They just need to get it out.

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:57.060
So listen to your child
when he comes to you

00:18:57.060 --> 00:18:59.010
and wants to talk to
you about anything.

00:18:59.010 --> 00:19:00.560
I don't care if
he's two, and he's

00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:02.430
talking about the
birdie that just went by

00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:04.570
or the boo-boo he has.

00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:06.460
Just encourage more talk.

00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:08.210
Because I can promise
you, when your child

00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:11.920
gets to be 11 and 12, he's
going to go in that cave.

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:14.790
And you won't see him
for a long, long time.

00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:16.947
He's hibernating until he's 17.

00:19:16.947 --> 00:19:18.030
That's when they come out.

00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:18.571
It's amazing.

00:19:21.910 --> 00:19:24.610
Treat your children
with respect.

00:19:24.610 --> 00:19:26.860
I am often, always, asked.

00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:30.110
Yesterday, when I did a show
for the Hallmark program, that

00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:32.145
was one of the
questions I was asked.

00:19:32.145 --> 00:19:34.870
Well, how do you instill
respect in a child?

00:19:34.870 --> 00:19:36.740
My first answer
to that is, well,

00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:38.410
do you treat your
child with respect?

00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:41.700
Do you speak respectfully
to your child?

00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:43.200
Maybe, maybe not.

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:43.930
I can't tell.

00:19:43.930 --> 00:19:45.050
I don't know you.

00:19:45.050 --> 00:19:47.630
But I've heard an awful
lot of disrespect.

00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:50.370
Just recently at Ralph's
Market in the Palisades,

00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:54.420
a woman turned to her son and
said, what's your problem?

00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:56.340
And I just stood there
thinking, did you

00:19:56.340 --> 00:19:58.307
really yell that at your child?

00:19:58.307 --> 00:20:00.390
First of all, he doesn't
know what his problem is,

00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:02.140
and you're being irritating.

00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:03.747
And, oh my gosh,
what a mess that is.

00:20:03.747 --> 00:20:05.080
I should have given her my card.

00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:06.032
Here, see me.

00:20:06.032 --> 00:20:07.490
She probably would've
yelled at me.

00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:10.650
I would have hated that.

00:20:10.650 --> 00:20:16.720
The same respect you show your
child will come back to you.

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:18.720
Talk to him with respect.

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:21.240
Talk to him in just the way
you want him to talk to you.

00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:23.580
Talk to him the way you
would talk to your friends.

00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:27.900
We treat, often, our friends
and our extended family

00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:30.630
more kindly and
more respectfully

00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:32.690
than we speak to
our own children.

00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:35.030
I'm not saying say
please and thank you.

00:20:35.030 --> 00:20:36.720
I'm talking about your tone.

00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:41.694
I'm talking about how you
relate to a child verbally.

00:20:41.694 --> 00:20:44.110
All children-- remember, we're
talking about connectedness

00:20:44.110 --> 00:20:49.700
here, so respecting, talking,
listening, being a container.

00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:52.480
All children need very
clear limits and boundaries.

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:55.110
We're going to talk
about this later.

00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:57.400
Very hard to do,
because you're tired.

00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:58.590
It's the end of your day.

00:20:58.590 --> 00:20:59.560
Good Lord, it's hard.

00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:00.730
I know.

00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:02.970
But when you have
limits and boundaries,

00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:07.150
and when you follow through,
your children will feel safe,

00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:09.600
and they will learn to
trust that you will be there

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:10.610
for them.

00:21:10.610 --> 00:21:15.790
The kids who do not have
clear boundaries kept,

00:21:15.790 --> 00:21:17.880
who have parents who
do not follow through

00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:21.310
on their threats, are the kids
who not only don't feel safe

00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:23.620
but often get in
trouble in school.

00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:27.790
Just a little thought
I would give you.

00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:29.484
There are going to
be difficult times.

00:21:29.484 --> 00:21:31.150
There are going to
be bumps in the road.

00:21:31.150 --> 00:21:33.450
There are going to be
challenges to your parenting.

00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:35.630
That's what all
of this is about.

00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:38.170
And your child is working
really, really hard

00:21:38.170 --> 00:21:41.080
to become himself,
whatever that is.

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:43.480
But I can promise you
that becoming yourself

00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:45.722
means he's not
going to become you.

00:21:45.722 --> 00:21:48.060
He's going to have
to separate from you.

00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:50.930
And oftentimes, being
separate from you

00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:55.370
means going against what you are
saying, not agreeing with you,

00:21:55.370 --> 00:21:58.070
defying you, being disobedient.

00:21:58.070 --> 00:21:59.840
One of my kids used
to say to me when

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:02.040
I would use the word
behave, he would say,

00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:05.030
Mommy, I'm going to be-not-have.

00:22:05.030 --> 00:22:07.490
That was pretty great.

00:22:07.490 --> 00:22:09.170
By the way, he turned out OK.

00:22:09.170 --> 00:22:11.590
That kid's really an OK kid.

00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:14.100
So, this connectedness
will happen

00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:17.500
if you don't take their
icky behavior personally.

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:19.350
This is not about you.

00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:21.130
It's about your child.

00:22:21.130 --> 00:22:25.150
But it is about you, because the
way we respond to our children,

00:22:25.150 --> 00:22:28.930
and the way we talk to them,
and the time we spend with them,

00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:32.400
feeds our connectedness, feeds
their sense of significance,

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:35.940
and helps them to
be better kids.

00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:37.590
Let's talk about my
books for a second,

00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:40.840
because that's why I'm here,
just for a quick moment.

00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:46.080
This book, "Just
Tell Me What to Say,"

00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:48.650
is a book that my
publisher made me

00:22:48.650 --> 00:22:50.836
say, we'll put for
two- to six-year-olds.

00:22:50.836 --> 00:22:52.210
But the truth be
known, this book

00:22:52.210 --> 00:22:54.810
is really for parents
of kids of all ages.

00:22:54.810 --> 00:22:57.410
And it deals with
discipline, and food issues,

00:22:57.410 --> 00:22:59.850
and sibling issues,
and stuff like that.

00:22:59.850 --> 00:23:02.382
And then it's, how do you
talk to your kid about death?

00:23:02.382 --> 00:23:04.840
If you have a four-year-old,
you should be there about now.

00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:06.800
Four-year-olds all want
to know about death.

00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:08.480
How do you talk to
your kids about sex?

00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:10.480
They're all going to ask
where babies come from.

00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:12.130
You better know
the answer to that.

00:23:12.130 --> 00:23:15.340
How do you talk to
kids about earthquakes?

00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:17.070
We talked about that.

00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:19.220
How do you talk to kids
about serious illness?

00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:21.240
Somebody's going to
have something bad.

00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:24.100
So this is a very practical
book kind of aimed

00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:26.640
at the younger child,
but good for all.

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:28.150
And this is the
book I referred to

00:23:28.150 --> 00:23:30.140
before that talked
about inculcating

00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:31.540
your kids with character traits.

00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:34.370
Let me just say, my books
sound just like me when I talk.

00:23:34.370 --> 00:23:35.500
They're not haughty.

00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:38.490
They're not terribly cerebral.

00:23:38.490 --> 00:23:39.580
They're logical.

00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:40.230
It makes sense.

00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:41.480
Hands-on tips and scripts.

00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:42.340
OK, moving on.

00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:43.630
Done with the hard sale.

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:50.650
I think that self-reliance is
one of the most critical traits

00:23:50.650 --> 00:23:54.110
we can inculcate in
our kids, of all ages.

00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:56.480
Because when a kid
is self-reliant,

00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:58.420
he feels good about himself.

00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:02.820
When a kid is self-reliant,
he will become resilient.

00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:05.860
When a child has a
sense of self-reliance,

00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:07.720
he's not so afraid.

00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:10.380
The bumps in the road that
happen won't knock him down.

00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:14.020
He'll know how to save himself.

00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:16.050
I think it's a critical trait.

00:24:16.050 --> 00:24:19.210
I was at the airport, which
is one of my favorite places

00:24:19.210 --> 00:24:20.694
to observe.

00:24:20.694 --> 00:24:23.110
I go to the airport a lot,
because two of my grandchildren

00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:23.850
don't live in LA.

00:24:23.850 --> 00:24:25.630
So I'm in airports a lot.

00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:27.490
And I saw this one
scene-- and I just

00:24:27.490 --> 00:24:32.560
loved it-- where a little
girl, probably six or seven,

00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:35.740
was walking down the--
what's it called, the thing?

00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:36.550
All the way down.

00:24:36.550 --> 00:24:38.530
There's a word I can't think of.

00:24:38.530 --> 00:24:41.170
Jetway, course way,
one of those words.

00:24:41.170 --> 00:24:41.850
Anyway--

00:24:41.850 --> 00:24:44.720
And she had her little
Strawberry Shortcake suitcase.

00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:45.570
Can you picture it?

00:24:45.570 --> 00:24:46.710
One of these things.

00:24:46.710 --> 00:24:49.090
She's walking down
with her suitcase.

00:24:49.090 --> 00:24:53.515
She also has a doll-- I think
it was an American Girl doll.

00:24:53.515 --> 00:24:55.210
You know what I'm
talking about, right?

00:24:55.210 --> 00:24:58.080
American Girl doll-- and
her suitcase, and a jacket,

00:24:58.080 --> 00:24:59.210
and a pillow.

00:24:59.210 --> 00:25:01.770
And she was full loaded, locked
and loaded, walking down.

00:25:01.770 --> 00:25:03.250
And she's just
walking right away.

00:25:03.250 --> 00:25:04.990
And I'm just giggling
looking at her.

00:25:04.990 --> 00:25:06.120
She was adorable.

00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:08.580
And her mommy leans back
and says, can I help you?

00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:09.542
And she says, no!

00:25:09.542 --> 00:25:10.545
And she keeps walking.

00:25:10.545 --> 00:25:12.770
I thought, yes, I
like that mommy.

00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:14.490
I want to go tell her.

00:25:14.490 --> 00:25:16.672
Shortly thereafter, I
was going to Austin,

00:25:16.672 --> 00:25:17.880
so it's an interesting crowd.

00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:19.430
Oh, you know Austin.

00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:22.420
It's the Nerd Bird that flies to
Austin, between Silicon Valley

00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:23.910
and Austin.

00:25:23.910 --> 00:25:24.510
I digress.

00:25:24.510 --> 00:25:26.640
Sorry.

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:29.560
A dad and a mom and
a boy are walking,

00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:31.716
and the boy was probably nine.

00:25:31.716 --> 00:25:34.690
And nine-year-old
boys-- well, that's

00:25:34.690 --> 00:25:36.150
a different presentation.

00:25:36.150 --> 00:25:39.930
And he's walking, and
his was a Star Wars case.

00:25:39.930 --> 00:25:42.970
And he was walking like this.

00:25:42.970 --> 00:25:44.010
One of those things.

00:25:44.010 --> 00:25:47.150
And his father was doing one
of those, come on, hurry up.

00:25:47.150 --> 00:25:48.030
We're running late.

00:25:48.030 --> 00:25:50.200
And every time his
father said something,

00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:52.270
another spike grew in his foot.

00:25:52.270 --> 00:25:56.350
And he was going so slowly,
was carrying nothing else.

00:25:56.350 --> 00:25:58.290
And his father got
really ticked off at him.

00:25:58.290 --> 00:25:59.530
He said, oh, just forget it.

00:25:59.530 --> 00:26:00.105
I'll get it.

00:26:00.105 --> 00:26:01.980
And the father went and
grabbed his suitcase.

00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:03.750
And they walked on.

00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:06.050
And I thought to
myself, who is going

00:26:06.050 --> 00:26:09.590
to become a self-reliant
adult in this group here?

00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:11.450
You can see who's
off to a good start.

00:26:11.450 --> 00:26:15.340
Self-reliance is
really important.

00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:17.450
I want to talk about you
first, and the way you

00:26:17.450 --> 00:26:18.630
instill self-reliance.

00:26:18.630 --> 00:26:20.338
Then I want to give
you some tips for how

00:26:20.338 --> 00:26:22.280
to help your child
to be self-reliant.

00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:26.220
One of the sayings for which
I'm known is the following.

00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:29.330
Prepare your child
for the path, and not

00:26:29.330 --> 00:26:31.195
the path for your child.

00:26:31.195 --> 00:26:32.550
Should I say it again?

00:26:32.550 --> 00:26:37.370
Prepare the child for the path,
and not the path for the child.

00:26:37.370 --> 00:26:41.320
Parents spend a lot of
time preparing the path.

00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:42.467
He shouldn't do this.

00:26:42.467 --> 00:26:43.050
Wear a jacket.

00:26:43.050 --> 00:26:44.810
And taking the rocks
out of the road,

00:26:44.810 --> 00:26:46.300
and making sure he doesn't trip.

00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:47.780
And don't let him go there.

00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:51.230
And in so doing, we actually
undermine our children's

00:26:51.230 --> 00:26:55.790
ability to be self-reliant
and to be resilient.

00:26:55.790 --> 00:27:00.010
I think it is incredibly
important, because whether you

00:27:00.010 --> 00:27:04.469
call it overparenting, or tiger
parenting, or teacup parenting.

00:27:04.469 --> 00:27:05.510
Do you know what that is?

00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:06.720
Have you heard that one?

00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:09.150
Teacup parenting is
when with the child

00:27:09.150 --> 00:27:12.110
is held like a
precious China teacup.

00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:13.945
We hold him like
this because we don't

00:27:13.945 --> 00:27:15.960
want him to fall and break.

00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:18.730
Teacup parenting,
helicopter parenting--

00:27:18.730 --> 00:27:20.150
it's all the same thing.

00:27:20.150 --> 00:27:23.050
You undermine your child's
ability to become self-reliant.

00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:29.080
Your job is to help
your child grow

00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:34.680
to be a satisfied and
content adult, without you.

00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:37.931
I don't say happy because I
don't-- happy is one of those

00:27:37.931 --> 00:27:38.430
words.

00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:39.370
You're not supposed to be happy.

00:27:39.370 --> 00:27:40.540
You're supposed to be OK.

00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:42.130
You're supposed to be content.

00:27:42.130 --> 00:27:43.420
No one's happy all the time.

00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:44.810
That stupid song,
if you're happy

00:27:44.810 --> 00:27:47.212
and you know it clap your--
no one's happy all the time.

00:27:47.212 --> 00:27:48.170
Supposed to be content.

00:27:48.170 --> 00:27:49.210
This is OK.

00:27:49.210 --> 00:27:50.490
I'm good.

00:27:50.490 --> 00:27:54.210
So if we want our
kids to be that way,

00:27:54.210 --> 00:27:59.570
we have to help them to make
their own lives that way.

00:27:59.570 --> 00:28:03.200
And in so doing that,
it becomes clear to me

00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:07.570
that your real job as a
parent is to talk yourself out

00:28:07.570 --> 00:28:11.310
of a job, is to work
yourself out of a job.

00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:13.590
I was a school
director, and I knew

00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:15.210
I was doing well
as a director when

00:28:15.210 --> 00:28:18.470
I could leave the school for a
day or two and know the school

00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:20.860
would run really well,
because my teachers were

00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:23.080
so competent and self-reliant.

00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:25.050
The same should
happen with your kids.

00:28:25.050 --> 00:28:27.200
They should know what
to do without you

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:28.560
telling them what to do.

00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:33.340
And the truth be known, when
you are not with your children,

00:28:33.340 --> 00:28:35.020
they probably do.

00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:37.530
When your kids are
not with you, they

00:28:37.530 --> 00:28:39.760
become kids you haven't met.

00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:40.400
Why is that?

00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:44.970
Because your kids save their
worst behavior for the people

00:28:44.970 --> 00:28:47.630
whose love they trust the most.

00:28:47.630 --> 00:28:49.190
Makes sense when
you think about it.

00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:51.800
When you call home
to your parents now,

00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:54.530
do you call home and are
lovely and kind and everything

00:28:54.530 --> 00:28:55.140
is wonderful?

00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:55.639
No.

00:28:55.639 --> 00:28:58.300
Oh, Ma, such a bad day.

00:28:58.300 --> 00:29:00.310
Adult kids, still
let their parents

00:29:00.310 --> 00:29:03.040
get the hairy end of
the lollipop, as we say.

00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:05.040
And it starts when
they're very young.

00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:08.510
So it's not abnormal,
what's going on.

00:29:08.510 --> 00:29:11.320
But the truth of the
matter is that we

00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:13.600
should be putting our
kids in a position

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:16.700
that they don't need us.

00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:18.960
This is where
mindfulness comes in.

00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:21.100
Now mindfulness is
a very hot topic.

00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:24.110
I'm sure it's a hot topic
here, as it is everywhere.

00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:27.820
We've got lots of people in my
field who are talking about it.

00:29:27.820 --> 00:29:30.520
And the reason I'm
bringing this up

00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:34.180
is because this isn't
about mindfulness, per se,

00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:36.350
because this is about parenting.

00:29:36.350 --> 00:29:39.600
But in order to
be the parent whom

00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:45.100
you need to be for your child,
you have to parent mindfully.

00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:49.140
And sometimes using
mindfulness techniques

00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:52.110
will help you not to be
the kind of parent who

00:29:52.110 --> 00:29:53.600
shoots from the hip.

00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:55.990
In other words, steam
comes out of your ears,

00:29:55.990 --> 00:29:57.555
you start screaming,
you use language

00:29:57.555 --> 00:29:59.930
you wish you didn't use-- I'm
not talking about swearing,

00:29:59.930 --> 00:30:02.280
but just words that
are unkind-- you

00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:04.700
don't speak to your
kid respectfully.

00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:07.380
We need to use mindfulness
in our parenting,

00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:09.900
because your kids are
going to drive you nuts.

00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:12.210
If they're not doing it
now, you're on the cusp.

00:30:12.210 --> 00:30:13.740
It will happen.

00:30:13.740 --> 00:30:16.060
Nobody steers clear of this.

00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:18.127
Your kids are going
to frustrate you.

00:30:18.127 --> 00:30:19.710
They're going to put
you on the brink.

00:30:19.710 --> 00:30:22.460
And all that stuff
is going to happen.

00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:24.680
And the way you react
to that behavior

00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:29.570
has everything to do with
how and who your child is,

00:30:29.570 --> 00:30:32.400
who he will become,
and how he behaves.

00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:35.452
You influence that far
more than you know.

00:30:35.452 --> 00:30:41.390
You reflect to your child
who you see and who he is.

00:30:41.390 --> 00:30:44.280
This is the image
he's going to absorb

00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:46.800
and contributes to
his sense of self.

00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:49.490
So if you're looking at him and
saying, [INAUDIBLE], whatever.

00:30:49.490 --> 00:30:51.781
You're yelling, and screaming,
and giving him all that.

00:30:51.781 --> 00:30:53.630
He's looking at
himself as being,

00:30:53.630 --> 00:30:54.950
I must not be worthy of much.

00:30:54.950 --> 00:30:55.970
My mom's yelling at me.

00:30:55.970 --> 00:30:57.840
My dad's yelling at me.

00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:02.740
On top of that, we know that
mindfulness and the techniques

00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:06.100
therein for grownups
certainly allow

00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:08.610
you to control your emotions.

00:31:08.610 --> 00:31:11.570
Parents ask me all the time,
what do I do if I get angry?

00:31:11.570 --> 00:31:14.240
And I say, well, do I look
like a yoga instructor?

00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:19.410
I can teach you a couple things,
but there are many techniques

00:31:19.410 --> 00:31:23.060
that we use when we parent
mindfully that will help you.

00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:25.390
Parenting mindfully means
controlling yourself.

00:31:25.390 --> 00:31:27.500
It means thinking
about what you do.

00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:30.380
It means being able to
get yourself into a place

00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:34.130
that you can be the kind
of parent you want to be.

00:31:34.130 --> 00:31:37.080
To that extent, it's important.

00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:40.350
I also want to show you--
I brought this with me

00:31:40.350 --> 00:31:42.850
because I grabbed it
at the last minute.

00:31:42.850 --> 00:31:45.120
This is a book that I
actually like very much.

00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:48.200
I'm selling my books,
not theirs, but oh well.

00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:51.180
This is called "Sitting
Still Like a Frog."

00:31:51.180 --> 00:31:59.000
And it's by-- I think she
pronounces her name Eline Snel.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:03.940
And it's a lovely little book
that's actually for kids.

00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:06.330
But it's applicable to
adults, too, of course.

00:32:06.330 --> 00:32:08.970
And it talks about
exercises in mindfulness

00:32:08.970 --> 00:32:10.797
that you will be able
to use with your kids

00:32:10.797 --> 00:32:11.630
when they get older.

00:32:11.630 --> 00:32:13.640
I'm about to say
something about that.

00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:15.280
But I wanted you
to see this book.

00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:18.710
It has a CD in the
back with a lady

00:32:18.710 --> 00:32:19.920
with a really annoying voice.

00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:21.570
I hope it isn't the author's.

00:32:21.570 --> 00:32:25.620
But nice ideas, good techniques
you'll be able to use.

00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:29.040
The reason I'm showing you
that is because I'm a good guy,

00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:31.860
but also because I want
you to know that it is not

00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:36.350
reasonable to expect your
children to be mindful,

00:32:36.350 --> 00:32:40.620
to use mindfulness techniques
under the age of five or six.

00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:41.340
She says five.

00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:42.210
I say six.

00:32:42.210 --> 00:32:43.350
Why is that?

00:32:43.350 --> 00:32:46.430
Because when children
are very young,

00:32:46.430 --> 00:32:50.460
they are controlled by a lot
of things, including impulses.

00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:54.837
And your impulse will always
trump your desire to be mindful

00:32:54.837 --> 00:32:55.920
and to do the right thing.

00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:58.520
Kids are subject
to their impulses.

00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:01.070
Do you remember-- is
any of you old enough

00:33:01.070 --> 00:33:03.090
to know who Porky Pig was?

00:33:03.090 --> 00:33:05.710
Ba da ba da ba da ba
da, that's all, folks.

00:33:05.710 --> 00:33:08.210
When Porky was a bad little
pig, do you remember,

00:33:08.210 --> 00:33:10.610
little angel Porky
would come out over him.

00:33:10.610 --> 00:33:13.600
She was in a halo and a
gown, and she would say, yep,

00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:15.636
yep, yep, now, Porky,
you be a good little pig.

00:33:15.636 --> 00:33:17.260
And at the same time
that would happen,

00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:19.051
a devil Porky would
come on the other side.

00:33:19.051 --> 00:33:23.310
And he would have a belly, and
cloven hooves, and the ears,

00:33:23.310 --> 00:33:26.050
and he would say, [INAUDIBLE],
you be a bad Porky.

00:33:26.050 --> 00:33:27.770
And there was this
conflict that went on.

00:33:27.770 --> 00:33:30.410
Your kids have angel
and Porkies in them.

00:33:30.410 --> 00:33:36.070
And the angel Porky is you,
doing what-- your child has

00:33:36.070 --> 00:33:38.980
inculcated you, has
integrated you, as the id

00:33:38.980 --> 00:33:41.895
or as the parent who's,
that's the right thing to do.

00:33:41.895 --> 00:33:44.470
But the devil Porky
is impulse control.

00:33:44.470 --> 00:33:46.470
And they just don't--
he's going to win.

00:33:46.470 --> 00:33:48.350
Impulse control is going to win.

00:33:48.350 --> 00:33:51.690
So asking a child
to be mindful--

00:33:51.690 --> 00:33:54.390
we want to set our kids
up to be successful,

00:33:54.390 --> 00:33:57.430
so be careful about asking
him to do these things when

00:33:57.430 --> 00:33:58.410
he's a little guy.

00:33:58.410 --> 00:34:00.710
He doesn't have the
concentration or the focus.

00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:01.860
He can get there.

00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:05.580
We tell young kids when they're
angry to do things like blow

00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:06.510
out the candles.

00:34:06.510 --> 00:34:08.669
And you hold up your
fingers, and they go--

00:34:08.669 --> 00:34:09.610
[BLOWING]

00:34:09.610 --> 00:34:12.120
Because we know when we
flood our brains with oxygen,

00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:13.030
it calms us down.

00:34:13.030 --> 00:34:15.170
So that was just a
little aside that I

00:34:15.170 --> 00:34:18.130
wanted to talk to you
about about mindfulness.

00:34:18.130 --> 00:34:21.020
The other book that I brought--
this is totally non sequitur.

00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:23.590
I apologize, but I
don't want to forget--

00:34:23.590 --> 00:34:27.223
is a wonderful book called
"Your Fantastic Elastic Brain."

00:34:27.223 --> 00:34:28.889
And this is not for
your little bitties.

00:34:28.889 --> 00:34:32.286
But this is really for kids in
the 4 and 1/2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,

00:34:32.286 --> 00:34:34.969
10, 11, by this terrific
lady, JoAnn Deak,

00:34:34.969 --> 00:34:37.219
who knows all there is to
know about kids, and brains,

00:34:37.219 --> 00:34:39.949
and teaching in
the key of brain,

00:34:39.949 --> 00:34:42.199
as opposed to what someone
else says you should learn.

00:34:42.199 --> 00:34:44.719
And it's a great book that
helps kids to understand

00:34:44.719 --> 00:34:49.239
all the anatomy of the brain,
and the different parts,

00:34:49.239 --> 00:34:52.639
and helps them understand that
there is actually something

00:34:52.639 --> 00:34:54.760
over which they can
have some control.

00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:58.210
So I just thought I would drop
that for you as a little treat.

00:34:58.210 --> 00:35:01.710
So what's the child's role
in the self-reliance thing?

00:35:01.710 --> 00:35:05.359
Well, raising kids is really
about raising parents.

00:35:05.359 --> 00:35:06.900
Actually we're not
even raising kids.

00:35:06.900 --> 00:35:08.000
We're raising adults.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:08.970
They're already kids.

00:35:08.970 --> 00:35:11.270
So I don't even know
why we call it that.

00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:14.190
The child has to pass through
those stages we've discussed.

00:35:14.190 --> 00:35:18.050
And every child has a different
time line for doing that.

00:35:18.050 --> 00:35:21.590
But every child is born
with a different profile.

00:35:21.590 --> 00:35:24.920
Even my three children, two
minutes and 10 minutes apart,

00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:25.820
are very different.

00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:26.440
Why is that?

00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:29.530
Because each child has
a different temperament.

00:35:29.530 --> 00:35:32.000
Children are born
with temperament.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:33.950
Am I talking foreign here?

00:35:33.950 --> 00:35:34.450
No?

00:35:34.450 --> 00:35:36.640
OK, we good?

00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:39.830
Temperament and personality
are two different things.

00:35:39.830 --> 00:35:43.610
Your temperament is
the how of what you do.

00:35:43.610 --> 00:35:49.900
So it's adaptability, and
flexibility, and intensity,

00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:53.530
and energy level, and need for
regularity, and all that stuff.

00:35:53.530 --> 00:35:54.720
That's your temperament.

00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:57.270
The factory-equipped
model comes out,

00:35:57.270 --> 00:35:59.130
that when you're
expecting-- there he comes,

00:35:59.130 --> 00:36:00.830
and he got someone's
temperament.

00:36:00.830 --> 00:36:03.480
It is inherited.

00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:07.530
When temperament
meets environment,

00:36:07.530 --> 00:36:09.640
you get personality.

00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:14.350
So that one child who is slow
to warm up-- probably a category

00:36:14.350 --> 00:36:14.910
you've heard.

00:36:14.910 --> 00:36:16.910
We used to use the
"s" word and say shy.

00:36:16.910 --> 00:36:18.220
We don't say shy anymore.

00:36:18.220 --> 00:36:21.070
It's the new "s" word.

00:36:21.070 --> 00:36:25.980
A slow-to-warm-up kid-- that
child is going to be a totally

00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:28.810
normal, typical kid at home,
running, talking, playing,

00:36:28.810 --> 00:36:29.970
jumping on furniture.

00:36:29.970 --> 00:36:33.020
But when that child goes to
school, probably very quiet,

00:36:33.020 --> 00:36:34.230
doesn't say anything.

00:36:34.230 --> 00:36:35.760
That's when the
teacher says, gosh,

00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:37.093
we've never heard your kid talk.

00:36:37.093 --> 00:36:38.310
And you say, really?

00:36:38.310 --> 00:36:42.400
So that's temperament
becoming different personality

00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:44.810
in one environment
or in another.

00:36:44.810 --> 00:36:47.190
So every child is born
with that temperament.

00:36:47.190 --> 00:36:50.885
He also acquires traits
from living with you.

00:36:50.885 --> 00:36:52.550
He absorbs what you do.

00:36:52.550 --> 00:36:55.170
He's watching you all the
time, everything you do.

00:36:55.170 --> 00:36:57.566
You put something in your
mouth, and your child says,

00:36:57.566 --> 00:36:58.690
what are you eating, Mommy?

00:36:58.690 --> 00:36:59.880
What is that, Daddy?

00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:01.720
They're kind of all up
in you all the time.

00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:04.140
They're watching
everything you do.

00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:07.459
And there's this whole
new field of epigenetics--

00:37:07.459 --> 00:37:10.000
I don't know if you're learning
about that, talking about it,

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:10.750
thinking about it.

00:37:10.750 --> 00:37:13.460
It's utterly fascinating--
which is the field that

00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:16.720
helps us to understand
that we can actually

00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:23.300
change genetic material,
literally, by the environment.

00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:26.360
And they've done amazing
studies with twins about that,

00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:27.770
and it's utterly fascinating.

00:37:27.770 --> 00:37:30.990
So we know that children
can actually change

00:37:30.990 --> 00:37:32.720
based on the environment
that they're in.

00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:35.585
I mean biologically,
not just behaviorally.

00:37:38.590 --> 00:37:40.680
But for all kids, we know this.

00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:43.440
In order to grow up,
there are three peaks

00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:46.650
that children must climb.

00:37:46.650 --> 00:37:48.150
No one can grow up without them.

00:37:48.150 --> 00:37:51.130
They need to learn to
tolerate frustration.

00:37:51.130 --> 00:37:54.060
They need to learn to
tolerate disappointment.

00:37:54.060 --> 00:37:57.210
And they need to learn
to delay gratification.

00:37:57.210 --> 00:38:00.480
You know in your world,
you have to learn that.

00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:01.500
You have to do that.

00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:04.680
You're not going to be
the class president.

00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:06.767
The playdate's going
to get canceled.

00:38:06.767 --> 00:38:08.850
You're not going to get a
new car that you thought

00:38:08.850 --> 00:38:11.120
you would get when you
were 16, whatever it is.

00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:13.500
But in order to grow
up and to become

00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:17.520
a self-reliant, resilient child,
you need to learn those things.

00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:21.090
Otherwise you will fall apart.

00:38:21.090 --> 00:38:24.560
As the child climbs
these peaks, there

00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:27.040
are going to be a lot
of emotions expressed.

00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:29.500
And that's where your
mindfulness stuff

00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:33.040
is going to step in and help you
to help him to deal and become

00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:36.070
aware of his emotions
and how they affect him

00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:37.900
when da, da, da da, da.

00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:41.760
So there's this delicate
dance that parent and child

00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:42.400
do together.

00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:44.710
We call that goodness of fit.

00:38:44.710 --> 00:38:47.480
You've got your problems, and
your stuff, and your interests,

00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:50.230
and the child's problems, and
his stuff, and his interests.

00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:52.500
And we've got to figure
out how you dance together.

00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:55.560
Not so easy.

00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:58.870
One of the incorrect
notions that we have as we

00:38:58.870 --> 00:39:00.920
do this dance is
that we're supposed

00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:02.530
to protect our children.

00:39:02.530 --> 00:39:05.000
We're supposed to shelter
them from disappointment,

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.670
or from pain, or
from frustration.

00:39:07.670 --> 00:39:10.720
But the truth be told, it
is through experiencing

00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:13.450
these very things
that your kids grow

00:39:13.450 --> 00:39:16.312
the ability to be in the world.

00:39:16.312 --> 00:39:18.370
It's like building immunities.

00:39:18.370 --> 00:39:19.810
You got to do it.

00:39:19.810 --> 00:39:22.610
So, you know what the
toughest part of your skin is,

00:39:22.610 --> 00:39:23.540
by the way?

00:39:23.540 --> 00:39:25.918
Any idea?

00:39:25.918 --> 00:39:27.185
This isn't a quiz.

00:39:27.185 --> 00:39:28.370
AUDIENCE: Your hand?

00:39:28.370 --> 00:39:29.580
BETSY BROWN BRAUN: Your hand?

00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:30.390
AUDIENCE: Heel?

00:39:30.390 --> 00:39:31.720
BETSY BROWN BRAUN: Heel's
a really good answer.

00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:33.720
Hand wasn't a bad answer,
but heel's really good

00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:34.940
because the skin is so tough.

00:39:34.940 --> 00:39:37.111
It's a scar.

00:39:37.111 --> 00:39:38.610
That's really
interesting, isn't it?

00:39:38.610 --> 00:39:41.880
That a scar is the
toughest part of your skin.

00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:43.640
And that says it all.

00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:49.820
Children need to be hurt
in order to not be hurt.

00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:51.970
Dr. Spock, who you really
probably don't remember,

00:39:51.970 --> 00:39:54.830
but Dr. Spock had a wonderful
phrase where he said,

00:39:54.830 --> 00:39:57.190
"The child who has
not been bandaged

00:39:57.190 --> 00:39:59.846
has not been well parented."

00:39:59.846 --> 00:40:02.040
Good point, huh?

00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:05.720
The trait that's at the top of
my list for helping children,

00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:07.380
for putting children
in the position

00:40:07.380 --> 00:40:10.960
to be content and
satisfied, is self-reliance.

00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:12.780
Because self-reliant
kids grow up

00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:15.290
to feel confident, and
competent, and resourceful,

00:40:15.290 --> 00:40:17.130
and spontaneous.

00:40:17.130 --> 00:40:19.200
And the two critical
points you need

00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:21.580
to learn as we talk
about self-reliance,

00:40:21.580 --> 00:40:26.680
just for a bit more,
are number one,

00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:29.840
you may not hover
over your child.

00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:35.930
Hovercraft parents do not
raise self-reliant children.

00:40:35.930 --> 00:40:38.530
So you need to back off.

00:40:38.530 --> 00:40:41.270
Children need space between you.

00:40:41.270 --> 00:40:44.120
The second thing is,
you need to tolerate--

00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:47.240
you need to tolerate--
your child's unhappiness.

00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:49.550
It is so hard when
your child is sad.

00:40:49.550 --> 00:40:51.830
I don't care how old-- my
kids, when they're unhappy.

00:40:51.830 --> 00:40:54.160
You're only as happy as
you're least happy kid.

00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:56.380
You know that.

00:40:56.380 --> 00:40:59.240
But you've got to learn that
your child needs to be unhappy.

00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:00.620
He needs to be frustrated.

00:41:00.620 --> 00:41:01.900
He needs to be disappointed.

00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:04.140
Stop trying to fix everything.

00:41:04.140 --> 00:41:06.986
Because your child will learn as
you go back and say, you know,

00:41:06.986 --> 00:41:09.820
this morning, you were so upset.

00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:12.910
You were so angry at me because
I said you couldn't, whatever,

00:41:12.910 --> 00:41:13.532
whatever.

00:41:13.532 --> 00:41:14.365
And now look at you.

00:41:14.365 --> 00:41:15.250
You're Fine.

00:41:15.250 --> 00:41:16.794
You got through it.

00:41:16.794 --> 00:41:19.210
And they have to learn that
that's going to happen in life

00:41:19.210 --> 00:41:22.560
and they'll get through it.

00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:25.102
Here are a few
tips, quickie tips.

00:41:25.102 --> 00:41:25.810
How are we doing?

00:41:25.810 --> 00:41:27.490
Are we good?

00:41:27.490 --> 00:41:31.030
OK, a few tips for encouraging
self-reliance in your kids.

00:41:31.030 --> 00:41:33.530
Number one, your
daily life should

00:41:33.530 --> 00:41:36.570
be filled with rituals
that do not change.

00:41:36.570 --> 00:41:38.190
Parents who aren't
organized or don't

00:41:38.190 --> 00:41:40.910
have the business of
daily life organized,

00:41:40.910 --> 00:41:43.380
they do not teach their
kids to be self-reliant.

00:41:43.380 --> 00:41:45.770
Because knowing the
way things are done

00:41:45.770 --> 00:41:48.540
enables your child to
do them for himself.

00:41:48.540 --> 00:41:50.740
I always brush my
teeth after breakfast.

00:41:50.740 --> 00:41:55.290
I can never take a bath
before I do whatever.

00:41:55.290 --> 00:41:58.220
Your life should be
filled with rituals.

00:41:58.220 --> 00:42:00.640
Whether it's going to
sleep at night, or the way

00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:03.620
you have breakfast in the
morning, or how you go to bed.

00:42:03.620 --> 00:42:06.360
A ritual-filled
life helps children

00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:09.470
to let go and be self-reliant.

00:42:09.470 --> 00:42:11.680
Number two, we need
to create systems

00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:13.980
in your house that
encourage self-reliance.

00:42:13.980 --> 00:42:18.480
So with your child's help, you
could make a pictograph if he

00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:22.670
doesn't read-- your little
ones don't-- that has a picture

00:42:22.670 --> 00:42:24.620
of a toothbrush, has
a picture of a jacket,

00:42:24.620 --> 00:42:28.300
has a picture of a backpack,
and hang it by the back door.

00:42:28.300 --> 00:42:30.900
And when you say to your
child, have you done everything

00:42:30.900 --> 00:42:33.750
you need to do, he can
look at it himself.

00:42:33.750 --> 00:42:37.130
You need to put things
in your house that

00:42:37.130 --> 00:42:38.640
help them to be self-reliant.

00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:41.624
Like have little bitty
pitchers for milk.

00:42:41.624 --> 00:42:43.790
You shouldn't always be
pouring milk for your child.

00:42:43.790 --> 00:42:45.820
They learn in nursery
school at two and a half

00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:46.820
to pour their own juice.

00:42:46.820 --> 00:42:47.986
They don't do juice anymore.

00:42:47.986 --> 00:42:49.200
Sorry, water.

00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:52.520
So why aren't they pouring
their own stuff at home?

00:42:52.520 --> 00:42:54.340
Have a basket of
snacks you've already

00:42:54.340 --> 00:42:57.660
put in little plastic bags,
keep it in the pantry,

00:42:57.660 --> 00:43:00.002
and then say to your child,
help yourself to a snack.

00:43:00.002 --> 00:43:01.710
So he's not always
saying, Mommy, get me.

00:43:01.710 --> 00:43:02.510
Mommy, get me.

00:43:02.510 --> 00:43:05.050
We want our kids
to be self-reliant.

00:43:05.050 --> 00:43:07.950
Allow your child to
do things for himself,

00:43:07.950 --> 00:43:10.850
and then accept the
job that he does.

00:43:10.850 --> 00:43:14.020
If he has put his towel
up, he has hung up

00:43:14.020 --> 00:43:16.570
his wet towel-- first
of all, glory be.

00:43:16.570 --> 00:43:20.119
And second of all, if it's
hung up poorly, leave it.

00:43:20.119 --> 00:43:21.660
Straighten it a
little, but leave it.

00:43:21.660 --> 00:43:23.170
Let him know he's done it.

00:43:23.170 --> 00:43:26.500
Except the job
that your kids do.

00:43:26.500 --> 00:43:29.320
My husband folds our
laundry every Sunday.

00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:30.360
I am so lucky.

00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:32.420
We've been married 43 years.

00:43:32.420 --> 00:43:32.930
I wash it.

00:43:32.930 --> 00:43:33.550
He folds it.

00:43:33.550 --> 00:43:35.500
We're in a great place.

00:43:35.500 --> 00:43:38.300
He never quite folds my
unmentionables the way

00:43:38.300 --> 00:43:39.760
I like them folded.

00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:41.710
I've never told him,
oh my god, can't you

00:43:41.710 --> 00:43:43.265
do a better job
folding my undies?

00:43:43.265 --> 00:43:43.765
No.

00:43:43.765 --> 00:43:47.440
When he's gone, I just quietly
refold them and I put them way.

00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:50.215
Because I want him to
continue to fold my laundry.

00:43:50.215 --> 00:43:52.140
Do you get what I'm saying here?

00:43:52.140 --> 00:43:53.880
OK, same thing
goes for your kids.

00:43:53.880 --> 00:43:58.840
Your job is to be a
consultant, not a director.

00:43:58.840 --> 00:44:01.270
Stop saying to your kids,
do this, do this, do this,

00:44:01.270 --> 00:44:01.930
do this.

00:44:01.930 --> 00:44:05.060
Let your child come to
you, give him suggestions,

00:44:05.060 --> 00:44:06.950
but stop directing your child.

00:44:06.950 --> 00:44:11.240
We want your kid
to be self-reliant.

00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:14.300
Teach your child how to
make decisions for herself.

00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:15.860
Instead of saying,
it's a cold day.

00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:16.980
Wear a jacket.

00:44:16.980 --> 00:44:19.160
Which is what most parents say.

00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:22.320
You could say, why don't you
go stand on the front porch

00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:25.750
and see how it feels
before you get dressed?

00:44:25.750 --> 00:44:28.040
You could say, you want
to look at the paper?

00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:30.280
Let's see what the
weather forecast is.

00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:32.554
Instead of saying,
take a jacket.

00:44:32.554 --> 00:44:33.470
It's going to be cold.

00:44:33.470 --> 00:44:36.410
We're teaching them to
take care of themselves.

00:44:36.410 --> 00:44:38.030
Model how you make decisions.

00:44:38.030 --> 00:44:40.720
Do you know that our kids never
learn how we make decisions?

00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:43.440
Because they don't hear
us thinking about it.

00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:46.510
Let's see, I'm going to go
here, and then after school I've

00:44:46.510 --> 00:44:47.180
got to go there.

00:44:47.180 --> 00:44:49.990
So I need to bring my heels in
addition to my tennis shoes.

00:44:49.990 --> 00:44:52.240
And then I'm going to bring
something to wash my face,

00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:54.020
because I'm going
to be-- OK, so now I

00:44:54.020 --> 00:44:55.770
know that's what I need to do.

00:44:55.770 --> 00:44:58.470
Or, oh, no, I'm not going
to do that because this

00:44:58.470 --> 00:45:01.150
would happen if I do it.

00:45:01.150 --> 00:45:01.790
Out loud.

00:45:01.790 --> 00:45:04.120
Let your kids hear you thinking.

00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:06.400
Because that's how
they learn to think.

00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:08.760
No one teaches them how to
think until you show them

00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:10.330
how to think.

00:45:10.330 --> 00:45:15.990
And know that experience
is the very best teacher.

00:45:15.990 --> 00:45:19.470
Repeated directions and
warnings will fall on deaf ears,

00:45:19.470 --> 00:45:20.310
for sure.

00:45:20.310 --> 00:45:22.950
In fact, we tell our
kids to do things

00:45:22.950 --> 00:45:26.480
so much that they have
learned to ignore us.

00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:28.680
We call that learned deafness.

00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:30.805
Because it's like the
Snoopy characters.

00:45:30.805 --> 00:45:32.860
They just, wa wa wa.

00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:35.900
They hear it too much.

00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:37.570
Let them learn the lesson.

00:45:37.570 --> 00:45:42.220
If he doesn't take a jacket
to school, you pray for snow.

00:45:42.220 --> 00:45:43.611
You've got my drift.

00:45:43.611 --> 00:45:45.860
Do we have time to talk about
discipline for a minute?

00:45:45.860 --> 00:45:46.360
Or not?

00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:46.850
MALE SPEAKER: 10 minutes.

00:45:46.850 --> 00:45:48.590
BETSY BROWN BRAUN:
We have 10 minutes.

00:45:48.590 --> 00:45:49.569
Wow, you have 10 hours?

00:45:49.569 --> 00:45:50.860
We could talk about discipline.

00:45:50.860 --> 00:45:53.026
I'm just going to say a few
things about discipline.

00:45:53.026 --> 00:45:54.730
I want to actually
talk about anger.

00:45:54.730 --> 00:45:56.970
But first of all I want to
say, the most common call

00:45:56.970 --> 00:45:58.430
that I get from parents is this.

00:45:58.430 --> 00:46:00.460
My kid just doesn't
listen to me.

00:46:00.460 --> 00:46:01.599
I hear it all the time.

00:46:01.599 --> 00:46:02.640
And I always say, really?

00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:03.900
Did you have his ears checked?

00:46:03.900 --> 00:46:04.570
Hahaha.

00:46:04.570 --> 00:46:06.390
It's not a problem of listening.

00:46:06.390 --> 00:46:11.290
It's a problem of not obeying,
or being defiant, or being

00:46:11.290 --> 00:46:11.929
obstinate.

00:46:11.929 --> 00:46:14.220
But it's not a listening
problem, so let's stop saying,

00:46:14.220 --> 00:46:16.330
my kid doesn't
listen, for starters.

00:46:16.330 --> 00:46:18.110
The idea with
discipline is that we're

00:46:18.110 --> 00:46:19.440
trying to teach our children.

00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:22.860
The word discipline does
not mean punishment.

00:46:22.860 --> 00:46:25.630
It does it mean
hurt, make feel bad,

00:46:25.630 --> 00:46:28.200
make cry, shame, embarrass.

00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:31.010
It means to teach, or learn.

00:46:31.010 --> 00:46:35.240
The word discipline is from the
Latin root word disciplina--

00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:37.400
and yes, I did
take Latin-- which

00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:39.120
means it's about knowledge.

00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:41.240
Like what discipline
were you in in college?

00:46:41.240 --> 00:46:42.570
Or disciple.

00:46:42.570 --> 00:46:43.290
Get it?

00:46:43.290 --> 00:46:46.180
So we're trying to pound our
kids to do the right thing.

00:46:46.180 --> 00:46:48.480
Why do I always have to
tell you to, whatever it is.

00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:49.580
Oops, sorry.

00:46:49.580 --> 00:46:51.580
And that's not how it works.

00:46:51.580 --> 00:46:55.210
The way that we help our
children to cultivate

00:46:55.210 --> 00:46:58.730
self-discipline, so the child
will do the right thing,

00:46:58.730 --> 00:47:01.790
is by using logical consequence.

00:47:01.790 --> 00:47:05.460
And my yellow book has a
whole chapter about this.

00:47:05.460 --> 00:47:08.490
But the single most common
mistake that we do-- number one

00:47:08.490 --> 00:47:10.320
is, we threaten too much.

00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:12.440
Number two is, we
don't give children

00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:14.850
warnings about what
we expect them to do.

00:47:14.850 --> 00:47:19.300
And number three is, we are
bad at following through.

00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:21.430
Warn, warn, warn, and then
we don't follow through.

00:47:21.430 --> 00:47:22.900
So you want your kid to
get ready for school.

00:47:22.900 --> 00:47:25.470
You're clapping your hands,
screaming at him to hurry up.

00:47:25.470 --> 00:47:26.600
And you've got the
keys, and you're

00:47:26.600 --> 00:47:27.320
saying, get your shoes on.

00:47:27.320 --> 00:47:28.340
And you shake the keys.

00:47:28.340 --> 00:47:29.410
I'm going to leave.

00:47:29.410 --> 00:47:30.440
I'm leaving.

00:47:30.440 --> 00:47:31.540
OK, hear me at the door.

00:47:31.540 --> 00:47:32.390
Shake, shake, shake.

00:47:32.390 --> 00:47:34.785
And then the child comes
running to you with his shoes,

00:47:34.785 --> 00:47:36.987
and he says, I'm
coming, I'm coming.

00:47:36.987 --> 00:47:37.820
And you don't leave.

00:47:37.820 --> 00:47:38.778
And what does he learn?

00:47:38.778 --> 00:47:41.470
He learns that he has
parents who have no cojones.

00:47:41.470 --> 00:47:44.070
So what I would say
to you, parents,

00:47:44.070 --> 00:47:47.270
is you need to learn to
discipline, to teach children

00:47:47.270 --> 00:47:49.580
using logical consequences.

00:47:49.580 --> 00:47:53.560
That means consequences that
are related to the misbehavior.

00:47:53.560 --> 00:47:56.200
If your child is
late for school,

00:47:56.200 --> 00:47:58.090
the punishment,
whatever that means,

00:47:58.090 --> 00:48:00.950
is not that he doesn't go
to Disneyland on Saturday.

00:48:00.950 --> 00:48:02.910
Or that when he hits
his brother you're

00:48:02.910 --> 00:48:05.310
not taking away his
favorite fire truck.

00:48:05.310 --> 00:48:08.060
Or when he doesn't
eat his food he's

00:48:08.060 --> 00:48:10.730
not going to get a
story at bedtime.

00:48:10.730 --> 00:48:13.300
Whatever your
consequence is, you

00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:15.260
tell the child what you expect.

00:48:15.260 --> 00:48:17.200
You tell them what the
consequence will be.

00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:18.900
You expect for it to happen.

00:48:18.900 --> 00:48:22.280
If it doesn't happen, you
impose it right then and there.

00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:25.940
There are logical consequences,
there are natural consequences,

00:48:25.940 --> 00:48:28.920
and there are
illogical consequences.

00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:30.720
An illogical
consequence is when it

00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:33.390
has nothing to do with
what's just happened.

00:48:33.390 --> 00:48:35.870
You know what, I don't like
the way you talked to me.

00:48:35.870 --> 00:48:37.091
No dessert tonight.

00:48:37.091 --> 00:48:37.590
What?

00:48:37.590 --> 00:48:38.030
What's that?

00:48:38.030 --> 00:48:38.530
Right?

00:48:38.530 --> 00:48:39.310
Crazy.

00:48:39.310 --> 00:48:40.960
A natural consequence
is when you

00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:42.650
don't have to do
anything at all.

00:48:42.650 --> 00:48:45.659
When my son left his water
rocket out, and I said,

00:48:45.659 --> 00:48:46.450
better put it away.

00:48:46.450 --> 00:48:47.190
Our dog will eat it.

00:48:47.190 --> 00:48:49.148
And he didn't, and he
came out the next morning

00:48:49.148 --> 00:48:51.480
and there was plastic
all over the lawn.

00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:52.480
Natural consequence.

00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:54.813
I didn't have to do anything,
including I didn't buy him

00:48:54.813 --> 00:48:56.080
a new water rocket.

00:48:56.080 --> 00:48:57.230
He learned about plastic.

00:48:57.230 --> 00:49:00.040
And by the way, if you have more
than one kid, with discipline,

00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:00.540
it's great.

00:49:00.540 --> 00:49:02.360
We have this thing
called ambient learning.

00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:04.480
I made up the phrase.

00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:07.044
Because the other two of my
kids put all their stuff away

00:49:07.044 --> 00:49:08.460
because they didn't
want Petey dog

00:49:08.460 --> 00:49:09.626
eating their rockets either.

00:49:14.570 --> 00:49:17.350
How interesting is it that
my presentations are all

00:49:17.350 --> 00:49:20.320
about parents and parenting,
and yet I'm a child development

00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:21.830
and behavior specialist?

00:49:21.830 --> 00:49:23.360
Kind of interesting.

00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:26.940
The truth of the matter is
that this is about parenting.

00:49:26.940 --> 00:49:29.550
I didn't write books
for kids to read.

00:49:29.550 --> 00:49:32.320
Parents say, will you
autograph it to my child?

00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:34.850
And I say, no, your child
doesn't need to read this.

00:49:34.850 --> 00:49:36.690
You need to read this.

00:49:36.690 --> 00:49:40.270
Having a child is not like
checking off another benchmark

00:49:40.270 --> 00:49:41.506
on the road of life.

00:49:41.506 --> 00:49:45.519
You got your partner, you got
your watch, you got your car,

00:49:45.519 --> 00:49:47.310
you got your house,
and you got your child.

00:49:47.310 --> 00:49:48.900
It doesn't work that way.

00:49:48.900 --> 00:49:51.010
You don't just take your
child in every six months

00:49:51.010 --> 00:49:53.560
to have a lube and oil,
or whatever that's called.

00:49:53.560 --> 00:49:57.640
Having kids who don't come with
little instruction tags tied

00:49:57.640 --> 00:50:01.520
to their big toe is really hard.

00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:03.790
You've got to figure
this out for yourself.

00:50:03.790 --> 00:50:05.780
Parenting has to be deliberate.

00:50:05.780 --> 00:50:07.650
It has to be mindful.

00:50:07.650 --> 00:50:10.150
And it has to be wholehearted.

00:50:10.150 --> 00:50:12.280
Everybody blows it
every now and again.

00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:13.460
Everybody does.

00:50:13.460 --> 00:50:15.830
And your kids will,
and you will, too.

00:50:15.830 --> 00:50:18.060
But if you can get
right back on the saddle

00:50:18.060 --> 00:50:20.480
and give it your
best shot, I'm pretty

00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:23.491
sure your kids will
be well launched.

00:50:23.491 --> 00:50:24.990
One last thing I
want to say to you.

00:50:24.990 --> 00:50:27.660
There is no such
thing as perfect.

00:50:27.660 --> 00:50:29.870
Eliminate that word
from your vocabulary.

00:50:29.870 --> 00:50:31.060
Don't ever say it.

00:50:31.060 --> 00:50:32.680
Do not expect it.

00:50:32.680 --> 00:50:34.160
There is excellence.

00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:36.870
There is working hard.

00:50:36.870 --> 00:50:39.180
But it's going to be
different for every family,

00:50:39.180 --> 00:50:41.700
and perfection is not
what we're striving for,

00:50:41.700 --> 00:50:44.550
unless you want to set
your child up for failure.

00:50:44.550 --> 00:50:46.910
So that's all I want
to say about that.

00:50:46.910 --> 00:50:48.670
I thought we would
have a few questions.

00:50:48.670 --> 00:50:49.320
We have time?

00:50:49.320 --> 00:50:50.290
MALE SPEAKER: Sure.

00:50:50.290 --> 00:50:52.686
BETSY BROWN BRAUN:
OK, so, did I--

00:50:52.686 --> 00:50:55.250
Oh no, we don't have
utter silence, do we?

00:50:55.250 --> 00:50:55.924
Yes?

00:50:55.924 --> 00:50:57.740
AUDIENCE: So, I have
a six-year-old son.

00:50:57.740 --> 00:50:59.439
BETSY BROWN BRAUN:
Ooh, satanic six.

00:50:59.439 --> 00:51:00.906
MALE SPEAKER: Let's
get it on the--

00:51:05.310 --> 00:51:06.940
AUDIENCE: So I have
a six-year-old son.

00:51:06.940 --> 00:51:10.500
He's at a STEM-based
LAUSD school, brand new.

00:51:10.500 --> 00:51:11.940
We feel very lucky,
because I hear

00:51:11.940 --> 00:51:14.790
it's not a typical LAUSD school.

00:51:14.790 --> 00:51:16.110
Down in Playa Vista.

00:51:16.110 --> 00:51:17.900
And the school's
great, but they're

00:51:17.900 --> 00:51:21.350
like overly helpful, these
eager new parents, new school.

00:51:21.350 --> 00:51:22.680
And so they had a talent show.

00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:24.610
We said, you're
going to try out.

00:51:24.610 --> 00:51:26.230
You may or may not get in.

00:51:26.230 --> 00:51:27.410
Just work hard.

00:51:27.410 --> 00:51:28.230
Do your best.

00:51:28.230 --> 00:51:29.900
But do you understand
what a tryout was.

00:51:29.900 --> 00:51:31.690
We wanted to explain that
to him so he wouldn't--

00:51:31.690 --> 00:51:32.890
BETSY BROWN BRAUN: He
was six at the time?

00:51:32.890 --> 00:51:34.620
AUDIENCE: Six just
a few weeks ago.

00:51:34.620 --> 00:51:36.260
So he went and did it.

00:51:36.260 --> 00:51:37.110
Hey, he got in.

00:51:37.110 --> 00:51:37.850
Great.

00:51:37.850 --> 00:51:40.300
Well, now it turns
out that-- and this

00:51:40.300 --> 00:51:43.260
is one example of what the
school does-- oh no, we

00:51:43.260 --> 00:51:46.950
realized as parents maybe
not all the kids got in.

00:51:46.950 --> 00:51:49.490
So is there something we
can give all the kids that

00:51:49.490 --> 00:51:52.050
auditioned, just in case?

00:51:52.050 --> 00:51:56.600
And we want him to learn that
not every team gets a trophy,

00:51:56.600 --> 00:51:58.090
not every kid gets in.

00:51:58.090 --> 00:52:00.650
But you did great, and we're
going to reward you with,

00:52:00.650 --> 00:52:03.794
you pick out dinner tonight, or
we'll fix your favorite meal.

00:52:03.794 --> 00:52:04.960
Because you did a great job.

00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:06.010
You worked hard.

00:52:06.010 --> 00:52:07.420
We'll reward you.

00:52:07.420 --> 00:52:10.701
How do you combat the
environment giving kids

00:52:10.701 --> 00:52:11.200
everything?

00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:13.580
Because they want
them in the teacup.

00:52:13.580 --> 00:52:15.700
We don't.

00:52:15.700 --> 00:52:17.830
BETSY BROWN BRAUN:
That's double mike.

00:52:17.830 --> 00:52:21.860
That's such a great story, and
such an important question.

00:52:21.860 --> 00:52:23.880
And I wish-- if I had
the answer for how

00:52:23.880 --> 00:52:25.939
we combat the
environment, just think--

00:52:25.939 --> 00:52:27.480
I wouldn't even have
to write a book.

00:52:27.480 --> 00:52:29.510
I'd be so popular.

00:52:29.510 --> 00:52:31.820
I think the answer to
that is reminding you

00:52:31.820 --> 00:52:34.880
that you are the most important
person in your kid's life.

00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:40.030
And if you could talk about
that-- he did get chosen,

00:52:40.030 --> 00:52:40.530
correct?

00:52:40.530 --> 00:52:41.370
AUDIENCE: He did.

00:52:41.370 --> 00:52:42.871
But we said, you
may or you may not.

00:52:42.871 --> 00:52:43.870
BETSY BROWN BRAUN: Yeah.

00:52:43.870 --> 00:52:45.050
Well, that's like in soccer.

00:52:45.050 --> 00:52:46.250
Everybody gets a trophy.

00:52:46.250 --> 00:52:50.750
That just makes-- or
nice swing in baseball.

00:52:50.750 --> 00:52:53.040
Sometimes you don't do as
well as you want to do.

00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:55.200
And I think you're not going to
have trouble with that at all,

00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:56.370
because you're aware of it.

00:52:56.370 --> 00:52:58.340
You're being mindful about that.

00:52:58.340 --> 00:53:00.980
But I would certainly
explain to your son,

00:53:00.980 --> 00:53:02.830
some people didn't get it.

00:53:02.830 --> 00:53:04.087
Sometimes that happens.

00:53:04.087 --> 00:53:04.920
Here's what's great.

00:53:04.920 --> 00:53:08.400
There'll be another
talent show next year.

00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:09.959
And by the way, if
I were the parent

00:53:09.959 --> 00:53:11.750
of the kid that didn't
get the talent show,

00:53:11.750 --> 00:53:13.990
I'd say, well, you
didn't make it at school.

00:53:13.990 --> 00:53:16.470
What else could we do
with that talent of yours?

00:53:16.470 --> 00:53:18.350
Maybe he'll have his
own concert at home,

00:53:18.350 --> 00:53:20.860
and make invitations, and
make lemonade and have--

00:53:20.860 --> 00:53:23.480
So combating it is
going to be impossible,

00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:26.970
but you're setting your child
up for-- you're steeling him

00:53:26.970 --> 00:53:29.610
against peer pressure for
all kinds of good things.

00:53:29.610 --> 00:53:32.460
With everything you feed
to him and explain to him,

00:53:32.460 --> 00:53:34.100
he will understand.

00:53:34.100 --> 00:53:37.470
And he will take your
attitude with him.

00:53:37.470 --> 00:53:39.170
Thank you for that
really good question.

00:53:39.170 --> 00:53:41.070
Was there a question over here?

00:53:41.070 --> 00:53:42.010
Wait-- watch this.

00:53:46.610 --> 00:53:49.110
AUDIENCE: We talked about
logical and illogical

00:53:49.110 --> 00:53:50.220
consequences.

00:53:50.220 --> 00:53:53.410
Can you elaborate more on--
I am totally guilty of,

00:53:53.410 --> 00:53:55.160
you weren't being nice
today, so we're not

00:53:55.160 --> 00:53:57.560
going to Disneyland
five days from now.

00:53:57.560 --> 00:54:00.664
So what would be a more
logical way of handling that?

00:54:00.664 --> 00:54:01.580
BETSY BROWN BRAUN: OK.

00:54:04.900 --> 00:54:06.790
Good for you, first of all.

00:54:06.790 --> 00:54:09.690
So we all heard the
question, right?

00:54:09.690 --> 00:54:11.050
Guilty, as charged.

00:54:11.050 --> 00:54:13.500
And you're owning your
own stuff, which I love.

00:54:13.500 --> 00:54:15.930
People ask me all the time,
because logical consequences

00:54:15.930 --> 00:54:16.430
are hard.

00:54:16.430 --> 00:54:18.200
You have to think
of it on the spot.

00:54:18.200 --> 00:54:21.030
And people ask me all the
time, how do you do that?

00:54:21.030 --> 00:54:22.580
How come you do
it so well, Bets?

00:54:22.580 --> 00:54:25.030
I say, well, I've been
doing it for 43 years,

00:54:25.030 --> 00:54:27.020
so I had a little experience.

00:54:27.020 --> 00:54:28.760
But this is what
I would tell you.

00:54:28.760 --> 00:54:31.320
What was your child doing
that you took Disneyland--

00:54:31.320 --> 00:54:35.386
what would be an
example of that?

00:54:35.386 --> 00:54:37.262
AUDIENCE: Hitting
a baby brother,

00:54:37.262 --> 00:54:40.401
or not finishing his
meal before running off.

00:54:40.401 --> 00:54:42.400
BETSY BROWN BRAUN: OK,
so not finishing the meal

00:54:42.400 --> 00:54:44.320
before running off, or
hitting your baby brother.

00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:46.190
Those, by the way, are
two separate chapters

00:54:46.190 --> 00:54:48.640
in the book, food and siblings.

00:54:48.640 --> 00:54:49.480
Just saying.

00:54:49.480 --> 00:54:51.830
But here's what I would say.

00:54:51.830 --> 00:54:54.780
Not finishing your meal,
that's an easy consequence.

00:54:54.780 --> 00:54:57.970
Because the logical consequence
about that is your child

00:54:57.970 --> 00:54:59.200
doesn't finish his meal.

00:54:59.200 --> 00:54:59.790
He gets up.

00:54:59.790 --> 00:55:01.560
You say, are you done?

00:55:01.560 --> 00:55:03.170
He says, yes, and he runs off.

00:55:03.170 --> 00:55:05.640
And you take his meal, and
you put it in the kitchen.

00:55:05.640 --> 00:55:07.890
And a half hour later, he's
going to come and tell you

00:55:07.890 --> 00:55:08.420
he's hungry.

00:55:08.420 --> 00:55:09.550
Now be prepared.

00:55:09.550 --> 00:55:11.150
It's going to be a bad night.

00:55:11.150 --> 00:55:12.004
Just know this.

00:55:12.004 --> 00:55:13.295
You're going to get through it.

00:55:13.295 --> 00:55:15.490
He does not get any food.

00:55:15.490 --> 00:55:17.326
And then in the
morning, he wakes up.

00:55:17.326 --> 00:55:18.200
He'll get through it.

00:55:18.200 --> 00:55:19.783
It'll be bad, but
it's only one night.

00:55:19.783 --> 00:55:21.540
Because then he'll
have a huge pile

00:55:21.540 --> 00:55:23.210
of pancakes in the morning.

00:55:23.210 --> 00:55:25.530
And you're going to say
to him the next night

00:55:25.530 --> 00:55:29.010
at dinner, remember what
happened last night?

00:55:29.010 --> 00:55:30.190
You got up from the meal.

00:55:30.190 --> 00:55:31.300
I took your plate away.

00:55:31.300 --> 00:55:34.160
And you were so hungry,
and you were so unhappy.

00:55:34.160 --> 00:55:35.190
And you cried and cried.

00:55:35.190 --> 00:55:36.960
Boy, was that a bad night.

00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:39.730
I think we're going to have
a better night tonight.

00:55:39.730 --> 00:55:42.970
By the way, do read
the chapter on food,

00:55:42.970 --> 00:55:45.670
because I have other suggestions
for that kind of thing.

00:55:45.670 --> 00:55:47.507
Regarding siblings
hitting one another.

00:55:47.507 --> 00:55:48.590
That's a really tough one.

00:55:48.590 --> 00:55:51.380
I do a whole sibling thing, but
I'll tell you this about that.

00:55:51.380 --> 00:55:55.370
For a child that hits the baby--
well, you know that's not OK.

00:55:55.370 --> 00:55:57.200
There's a lot of
stuff that's going on,

00:55:57.200 --> 00:56:00.070
so you have to think about
what's going on in his life.

00:56:00.070 --> 00:56:01.310
Look, I'm cheating on him.

00:56:01.310 --> 00:56:02.280
I had another baby.

00:56:02.280 --> 00:56:03.730
There's all that stuff.

00:56:03.730 --> 00:56:06.550
There's lousy local
conditions, where

00:56:06.550 --> 00:56:07.950
he had a bad day at school.

00:56:07.950 --> 00:56:08.640
He's tired.

00:56:08.640 --> 00:56:11.060
He didn't have a
snack, or whatever.

00:56:11.060 --> 00:56:13.650
I would say to
that child, you may

00:56:13.650 --> 00:56:16.530
play in any room in
our house, except where

00:56:16.530 --> 00:56:18.382
your baby brother is.

00:56:18.382 --> 00:56:19.840
And I would have
gates, and I would

00:56:19.840 --> 00:56:21.964
let him stand outside the
gate and want to come in.

00:56:21.964 --> 00:56:24.260
Oh no, people who hit
can't come in this room.

00:56:24.260 --> 00:56:25.220
That's one choice.

00:56:25.220 --> 00:56:26.220
It works.

00:56:26.220 --> 00:56:30.330
The second choice is-- how old
is your child, the older one?

00:56:30.330 --> 00:56:31.040
He's four.

00:56:31.040 --> 00:56:32.510
Oh, perfect.

00:56:32.510 --> 00:56:34.846
Because then you can say when
he hits the baby-- you now

00:56:34.846 --> 00:56:36.460
pretend you're the baby.

00:56:36.460 --> 00:56:39.550
And you say-- you're with
the baby-- oh, Jeremy, we

00:56:39.550 --> 00:56:41.470
don't like it when
Steven hits, do we?

00:56:41.470 --> 00:56:43.380
We don't want to be
with someone who hits.

00:56:43.380 --> 00:56:44.470
And you pick up Jeremy.

00:56:44.470 --> 00:56:47.210
And you go in your room
and you close the door.

00:56:47.210 --> 00:56:49.290
And now Jeremy is at the
door, lying on his back,

00:56:49.290 --> 00:56:52.430
kicking your door as hard
as he can, ready to, ahh.

00:56:52.430 --> 00:56:53.147
He's miserable.

00:56:53.147 --> 00:56:54.480
And when he gets to this point--

00:56:54.480 --> 00:56:55.580
[GASPING]

00:56:55.580 --> 00:56:57.830
Because you know how kids,
when they're cr-crying,

00:56:57.830 --> 00:56:58.742
they can't b-breathe.

00:56:58.742 --> 00:57:01.200
When he gets to that point,
you open the door, and you say,

00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:04.012
oh, are you ready to be with
your brother without hitting?

00:57:04.012 --> 00:57:05.470
Oh, great, then we
can be together.

00:57:10.060 --> 00:57:10.760
Yes?

00:57:10.760 --> 00:57:11.980
Wait.

00:57:11.980 --> 00:57:14.540
Yes then no.

00:57:14.540 --> 00:57:18.020
AUDIENCE: So I think I
heard you relate boundaries,

00:57:18.020 --> 00:57:21.094
and feeling safe, and
following through on threats.

00:57:21.094 --> 00:57:22.260
Was I right in hearing that?

00:57:22.260 --> 00:57:22.970
BETSY BROWN BRAUN: Yes.

00:57:22.970 --> 00:57:23.730
AUDIENCE: Would
you please say it

00:57:23.730 --> 00:57:25.970
again so that I can understand
it clearly this time?

00:57:25.970 --> 00:57:27.330
BETSY BROWN BRAUN: OK.

00:57:27.330 --> 00:57:28.636
OK, were you not listening?

00:57:28.636 --> 00:57:29.760
AUDIENCE: I was listening--

00:57:29.760 --> 00:57:30.020
BETSY BROWN BRAUN: Kidding.

00:57:30.020 --> 00:57:31.826
AUDIENCE: You said like four
one-liners in there, and I--

00:57:31.826 --> 00:57:32.742
BETSY BROWN BRAUN: OK.

00:57:32.742 --> 00:57:35.090
Here's what you need to do
with-- well, first of all,

00:57:35.090 --> 00:57:36.756
there's a million
things you have to do.

00:57:36.756 --> 00:57:39.600
But the common mistakes
that parents make

00:57:39.600 --> 00:57:42.532
are that they don't
give kids warning.

00:57:42.532 --> 00:57:43.990
And that's the one
that you missed.

00:57:43.990 --> 00:57:46.440
Whenever you want your
child to do something,

00:57:46.440 --> 00:57:50.160
you always go over to them
and you say, in five minutes,

00:57:50.160 --> 00:57:52.840
it's going to be time to
put the LEGOs down and put

00:57:52.840 --> 00:57:53.950
your shoes on.

00:57:53.950 --> 00:57:57.400
And you don't end that
sentence with, OK?

00:57:57.400 --> 00:57:59.470
Because you're not
asking permission.

00:57:59.470 --> 00:58:01.130
You say, did you
hear what I said?

00:58:01.130 --> 00:58:02.570
Do you copy, Red Rider?

00:58:02.570 --> 00:58:04.820
Whatever you want to
say, something that he

00:58:04.820 --> 00:58:07.382
will then answer you and
say, yes or no, or whatever.

00:58:07.382 --> 00:58:08.840
Then you come back
in five minutes,

00:58:08.840 --> 00:58:10.830
and you say, and now
it's time-- sorry--

00:58:10.830 --> 00:58:13.600
now it's time to
put your LEGOs down.

00:58:13.600 --> 00:58:15.551
And if he makes a
motion towards that--

00:58:15.551 --> 00:58:17.550
because it's really hard
to stop doing something

00:58:17.550 --> 00:58:19.510
you like to do and
then do something else.

00:58:19.510 --> 00:58:22.430
Even if you love your bath, you
really love your LEGOs, too.

00:58:22.430 --> 00:58:25.350
OK, so if he makes a
motion, you help him.

00:58:25.350 --> 00:58:26.740
Come on, let's save these LEGOs.

00:58:26.740 --> 00:58:27.900
You can do it again
in the morning.

00:58:27.900 --> 00:58:28.940
We'll put a sign on it.

00:58:28.940 --> 00:58:30.580
Don't touch, da, da, da, da, da.

00:58:30.580 --> 00:58:33.120
And then you go in and
use-- if he doesn't

00:58:33.120 --> 00:58:35.410
make a motion towards doing
what you say-- if you come

00:58:35.410 --> 00:58:38.870
to your bath now-- get ready
for a logical consequence--

00:58:38.870 --> 00:58:41.880
if you come to
your bath now, then

00:58:41.880 --> 00:58:44.030
we will have time for two books.

00:58:44.030 --> 00:58:46.260
Because children--
ritual-- children

00:58:46.260 --> 00:58:47.730
always have two books, not five.

00:58:47.730 --> 00:58:48.650
One for each hand.

00:58:48.650 --> 00:58:48.860
Two.

00:58:48.860 --> 00:58:49.750
Why do you have two?

00:58:49.750 --> 00:58:51.280
So you can take one away.

00:58:51.280 --> 00:58:52.280
OK?

00:58:52.280 --> 00:58:53.370
You get two books.

00:58:53.370 --> 00:58:55.730
So if you come now,
you'll have two books.

00:58:55.730 --> 00:58:57.590
If you don't--
logical consequence--

00:58:57.590 --> 00:58:58.720
we won't have time for two.

00:58:58.720 --> 00:59:00.380
We'll have only one.

00:59:00.380 --> 00:59:00.880
OK,

00:59:00.880 --> 00:59:02.290
So we warn.

00:59:02.290 --> 00:59:03.827
We state what the threat is.

00:59:03.827 --> 00:59:05.410
And then when he
doesn't come you say,

00:59:05.410 --> 00:59:08.195
OK, I guess we're
only having one book.

00:59:08.195 --> 00:59:08.820
Follow through.

00:59:08.820 --> 00:59:10.653
AUDIENCE: So following
through on the threat

00:59:10.653 --> 00:59:12.280
is enforcing the boundary?

00:59:12.280 --> 00:59:14.060
BETSY BROWN BRAUN: Absolutely.

00:59:14.060 --> 00:59:16.560
And why would you ever threaten
with something you can't do?

00:59:16.560 --> 00:59:17.620
Don't ever threaten
with something

00:59:17.620 --> 00:59:18.580
you don't want to
do when you've been

00:59:18.580 --> 00:59:19.939
waiting to go to the beach.

00:59:19.939 --> 00:59:21.730
You say, OK, if you
don't brush your teeth,

00:59:21.730 --> 00:59:23.130
we're not going to the beach.

00:59:23.130 --> 00:59:25.335
Which would be ridiculous.

00:59:25.335 --> 00:59:26.960
And you've been
wanting to go all week.

00:59:26.960 --> 00:59:28.824
Why would you say that?

00:59:28.824 --> 00:59:30.890
Get it?

00:59:30.890 --> 00:59:31.610
You'll learn it.

00:59:31.610 --> 00:59:32.400
I promise.

00:59:32.400 --> 00:59:33.340
Read my books.

00:59:33.340 --> 00:59:34.360
Enjoy.

00:59:34.360 --> 00:59:35.628
Thanks for coming.

00:59:35.628 --> 00:59:37.092
See you another time.

00:59:37.092 --> 00:59:59.092
[APPLAUSE]
