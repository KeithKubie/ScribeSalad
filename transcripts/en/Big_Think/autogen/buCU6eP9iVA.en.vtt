alcoholic and has abused alcohol then
the rate goes up maybe the risk is like

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590
the rate goes up maybe the risk is like
 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.090
the rate goes up maybe the risk is like
the 30% or 38% risk and that in the next

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100
the 30% or 38% risk and that in the next
 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.990
the 30% or 38% risk and that in the next
year they're going to do something
