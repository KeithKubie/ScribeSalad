00:00:00.989 --> 00:00:01.989
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Hey everybody.

00:00:01.989 --> 00:00:03.770
Thank you for showing up today.

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:05.320
I see we've got a full house, which is awesome.

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:11.000
I can see you guys are very excited about
Andrew's talk today, as I am.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.759
Andrew Skurka is kind enough to join us today.

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:17.260
He is a trekker, as many of you probably know.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:22.990
Described as "adventurer of the year" by Outside
and "a superman among trekkers" by National

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:24.960
Geographic.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.800
He's gone on a number of long treks all across
the country.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.840
We're very happy to have him today to talk
about his new book and go over the clinic.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.930
Thank you, Andrew, and here you go.

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.410
&gt;&gt;Skurka: Okay, cool.

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.720
Thank you.

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:44.880
[applause]

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:50.230
&gt;&gt;Skurka: I'd said I never expected to get
a standing room only turnout at Google.

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.030
Thanks very much for coming out.

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.960
Thank you, Andrew, for organizing it.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.370
I'm not sure how it normally works if you
want to speak here at Google, but I'm thankful

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.140
that my sister and brother-in-law are friends
with Andrew and Andrew was able to push it

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.929
on through the system and get this thing going
today.

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:10.030
Today's clinic is going to be mostly about
backpacking gear, supplies, and skills.

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.299
I give another presentation where I tell a
lot more stories, but today, I want to give

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:18.780
you guys some how-to information so that you
guys can go out there and enjoy your own backpacking

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.979
trips a little bit more.

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:24.900
Let's go ahead and just walk through what
we're going to do.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.030
The first thing, just quickly, a quick introduction.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.799
I want to understand who you guys are and
what sort of backpacking you do and what sort

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.229
of backpacking you want to do.

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:37.180
I'll just give you a little bit of context
for who I am too.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.929
Then I'll introduce three questions that I
always ask before I go on any backpacking

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:41.929
trip.

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:45.420
Those three questions are really helpful in
understanding the gear, supplies, and skills

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.909
that I'll need once I get out there.

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:51.960
And then, the bulk of the presentation will
be on this stuff that I have in front of me

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.920
here, where we'll come up with a hypothetical
trip that everyone can relate to.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.770
For example, we'll say, "We're going to go
for a 4 day trip in the high Sierra in August."

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.130
We'll talk about the conditions that we're
going to experience on a trip like that.

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:08.030
Then we'll talk about the gear that I would
take with me on such a trip.

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.000
Let me start off with you guys.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.950
Why don't you-- would someone be willing to
raise their hand, tell me who they are, what

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.830
sort of backpacking you do, and what you'd
like to get out of the clinic today.

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.410
Yes, sir.

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.360
&gt;&gt;male #1: My name's Justin.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:30.220
I'm a hiker.

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.710
I have hopes and aspirations for a hardcore
trip, but I have a 5 year old and a 7 year

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:36.710
old.

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:37.710
[laughter] We're mostly relegated to 2 mile
round trips to try to keep the kids happy.

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:38.710
I would just love to hear the family aspects
of getting out there.

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:39.710
&gt;&gt;Skurka: Okay, I'll do my best to address
some of the family-- I have to say that without

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:44.420
a wife or children, it'll be a little bit
difficult, but I can wonder.

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:45.420
Who else?

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:46.460
One more person?

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:47.460
Yes.

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:51.780
&gt;&gt;male #2: My name is Spass.

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.060
I'm interested in a lightweight backpack.

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.840
What's the minimum gear you can take.

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.510
&gt;&gt;Skurka: What was your name again?

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:03.510
&gt;&gt;male #2: Spass.

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:04.510
&gt;&gt;Skurka: Spass.

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.410
Spass was interested in basically knowing
what the minimal amount of gear you need to

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:07.410
take out there is.

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:08.410
I need one more person.

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:09.410
Yes.

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:10.410
&gt;&gt;male #3: EJ.

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:11.410
I've known you for 5 years on the forums.

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.430
Ex military, ex Boy Scout, now a hiker and
backpacker.

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:20.780
I'm interested in learning the more advanced
technique for upper gear

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.790
&gt;&gt;Skurka: All right.

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.820
EJ is basically interested in figuring out
how to lighten up his load and still be safe

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:29.660
and comfortable at the same time.

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:34.770
Just to give you guys some context about where
I'm coming from, I'm known for doing really

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:38.110
long, really light, really fast, long distance
backpacking trips.

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.650
This was my first mega long distance trip
I did back in 2004-2005.

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.370
It was the Sea-to-Sea route.

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:45.370
It was 7800 miles.

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:46.570
It took me 11 months.

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:53.620
I started up in GaspÃ©, Quebec in August and
finished in Cape Alava, Washington in July,

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.050
which means I spent winter on the trail.

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:58.730
I snowshoed 1400 miles that winter, through
Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota during

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.910
the months of January, February, and March.

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.950
My second mega long distance trip was the
Great Western Loop.

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.370
It was 6875 miles in 7 months.

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:10.740
I averaged 33 miles per day for 208 days.

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:18.489
Then, my last big trip was the Alaska-Yukon
expedition, which was 4700 miles in 6 months.

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.189
Skis, foot, and pack rafts.

00:04:21.189 --> 00:04:24.210
That was in 2010.

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.979
I've done a bunch of short trips in between
all those, but that gives you a pretty good

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:29.610
feel for where I'm coming at.

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:34.169
I should point out that even though I'm known
for doing these crazy trips that not many

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:37.180
people can relate to, I also do a lot of these
clinics.

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:38.550
I also guide trips.

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:43.210
I answer a lot of questions via email from
people who are much less experienced and who

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:47.650
aren't-- who don't have the ability to go
out for 6 months at a time.

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:52.780
So I hope that I can relate to you and give
you some information that is valuable.

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:58.379
Let me go over the three questions that I
always ask myself before I go on a trip.

00:04:58.379 --> 00:04:59.669
The first one is: what are my objectives?

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:03.050
I think it's a really important question that
not too many people ask themselves.

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.090
I'll go a little bit into each question a
little bit more in a second.

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:09.949
The second question I ask myself is: what
are the environmental and route conditions

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:11.610
that I'm going to be encountering?

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.669
Temperatures, precipitation, water availability,
wildlife, insects.

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:18.580
Then the final question that I always ask
is: what are the gear, supplies, and skills

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:23.259
that I need to help achieve my objectives
while keeping me safe and comfortable in those

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:25.159
environmental and route conditions.

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:28.300
The way I think about it, gear, supplies,
and skills are just tools.

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:29.969
They're just enablers.

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:30.969
They're just means.

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:35.860
But the whole reason I go out there is for
that objective, whatever that is.

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:38.240
Let's talk about objectives a little bit.

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:43.310
When you're on a backpacking trip, you can
basically break it down in two different types

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:44.310
of activities.

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:45.949
There's hiking, and then there's camping.

00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:48.889
Hiking is literally just putting one foot
in front of the other.

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:56.020
Camping is either camping or any extracurricular
activity that doesn't involve hiking: birding,

00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:01.219
journaling, bird watching, hunting, fishing,
photography.

00:06:01.219 --> 00:06:07.710
When I look at all the backpackers out there,
I put them into three different categories.

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:12.570
The first category I call an ultimate camper,
which is someone whose objective is basically

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:16.169
just to walk between campsites in order to
do something else.

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:21.249
They don't really-- It's not really relevant
that they know what sort of environmental

00:06:21.249 --> 00:06:24.150
and route conditions they're going to be getting
themselves into because they can carry as

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:25.580
much as they possibly want.

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:28.199
They're not carrying it for very far.

00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:32.180
And they also tend to carry really heavy,
luxurious, extraneous items.

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:36.980
These are the people you see set up in camp
at like 2:00 in the afternoon having a steak

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:37.980
lunch.

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:43.710
They're basically mobile car campers, I think
is maybe a better way to describe them.

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:48.039
They prefer, when they go for a backpacking
trip, they're in the pursuit of type 1 fun,

00:06:48.039 --> 00:06:52.729
which I say is fun to do and fun to talk about
later, which is very different than the way

00:06:52.729 --> 00:06:55.569
that an ultimate hiker approaches a backpacking
trip.

00:06:55.569 --> 00:06:58.879
An ultimate hiker looks something a little
bit more like this.

00:06:58.879 --> 00:07:02.509
When they go on a backpacking trip, their
primary objective is to walk.

00:07:02.509 --> 00:07:05.999
They need to know the exact environmental
and route conditions that they're going to

00:07:05.999 --> 00:07:11.499
be encountering because that way, they can
take the gear, supplies, and have the skills

00:07:11.499 --> 00:07:15.259
that they need to be safe and comfortable
in those conditions.

00:07:15.259 --> 00:07:18.289
They optimize their pack for the on trail
experience.

00:07:18.289 --> 00:07:21.990
They're packing light, but they're not packing
stupid light.

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:26.559
Then, maybe more importantly, they rely on
the stuff between their ears to keep themselves

00:07:26.559 --> 00:07:27.559
safe and comfortable.

00:07:27.559 --> 00:07:32.379
A great example of this is when an ultimate
hiker versus an ultimate camper chooses a

00:07:32.379 --> 00:07:33.379
campsite.

00:07:33.379 --> 00:07:39.960
An ultimate camper plods along the trail and,
after a couple miles, finds himself a campsite

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:44.900
that's right next to a water source, that's
been camped on by tens of thousands of other

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:45.900
people.

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:49.639
It's denuded of topsoil or of leaves or anything
like that.

00:07:49.639 --> 00:07:53.789
They set themselves up and they create this
big sprawl of stuff.

00:07:53.789 --> 00:08:00.139
Then they get out their really thick sleeping
pad and their double-walled big tent.

00:08:00.139 --> 00:08:01.629
They hang out there and then they go to bed.

00:08:01.629 --> 00:08:06.869
Whereas an ultimate hiker, they'll hike all
day and they'll choose a campsite that very

00:08:06.869 --> 00:08:09.099
few people have slept at, if any.

00:08:09.099 --> 00:08:17.039
It has this nice, thick bed of needles or
moss or leaves.

00:08:17.039 --> 00:08:19.490
They won't camp near a water source because
that's where the bugs are.

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:24.220
It's also-- The water source or the drainage
is usually where the cold, wet air accumulates

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:25.270
at night.

00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:30.409
So they'll camp somewhere else where it's
drier, less buggy, and warmer.

00:08:30.409 --> 00:08:34.570
That allows them to take less gear than they
would need otherwise.

00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:38.669
Then, an ultimate hiker is in the pursuit
of type 2 fun.

00:08:38.669 --> 00:08:40.760
Not fun to do, but fun to talk about later.

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:45.750
It's kinda like the way an athlete or a runner
approaches a marathon.

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:48.070
There's nothing fun about running a marathon.

00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:49.339
It's type 2 fun.

00:08:49.339 --> 00:08:54.399
It's something that afterwards, at night when
you're in the bars, you can be like, "Wow,

00:08:54.399 --> 00:08:58.209
that was-- remember, at mile 22, where I vomited
all over myself?

00:08:58.209 --> 00:09:02.630
That was [laughter] That was awesome, man."

00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:07.660
[laughter]
Then, there's this third category of backpacker.

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:09.590
I call them a camper by default.

00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:12.329
This is a classic shot.

00:09:12.329 --> 00:09:15.449
This is a picture of a Boy Scout that was
sent to me actually last night.

00:09:15.449 --> 00:09:19.160
I just had to include it in this.

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.450
They actually don't really understand the
primary objective.

00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:25.250
They haven't figured out whether they want
to go hiking or whether they want to go camping.

00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:29.290
And even if they did think about that, they
don't understand how that objective translates

00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:31.940
into the gear, supplies, and skills that they
need.

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:35.460
Then they don't understand what they're getting
themselves into.

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:40.829
They don't understand how cold it is, how
likely it is that it might rain, what the

00:09:40.829 --> 00:09:42.040
insect situation's going to be.

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:45.410
So they end up saying, "Well, I don't really
know what I'm getting myself into, so I'll

00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:49.370
take a lot of things just on the grounds of
'what if' or 'just in case' because I can't

00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:52.390
rule out those scenarios."

00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:59.080
They take a lot of heavy stuff, stuff that's
really easy to use, and just too much stuff.

00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:03.630
Unfortunately, they oftentimes experience
type 3 fun, which is not fun to do, and it's

00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:06.000
not fun to talk about later either.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.759
[laughter] Which you might say, "Well, then,
how can that be fun?"

00:10:10.759 --> 00:10:15.500
But this is an outdoor educator thing.

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:17.459
Everything is fun when you're outdoors.

00:10:17.459 --> 00:10:18.620
Okay.

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:23.180
The presentation today, this clinic here,
is designed for any backpacker who wants to

00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:25.410
at least sometimes be more like an ultimate
hiker.

00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:28.769
I am here to help you enjoy your hiking experience
more.

00:10:28.769 --> 00:10:31.560
I don't want it to be an arduous activity
between campsites.

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:35.520
I don't want you to sacrifice your comfort
or your safety if you want to enjoy that hiking

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:36.520
experience.

00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:40.870
[sighs] Okay, let's talk about gear and supplies
for a little bit.

00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:44.740
This is where the interaction starts a little
bit more.

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:48.980
Put yourself in the shoes of an ultimate hiker
and think about the characteristics of gear

00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:51.860
and supplies that you're looking for.

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:54.329
[pause] Please offer me some characteristics.

00:10:54.329 --> 00:10:56.569
What do you guys think are the most important
things?

00:10:56.569 --> 00:10:58.459
&gt;&gt;female #1: Lightweight, durable.

00:10:58.459 --> 00:10:59.880
&gt;&gt;Skurka: Lightweight, durability.

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:01.300
&gt;&gt;male #4: Waterproof.

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:02.650
&gt;&gt;Skurka: Depends, not necessarily.

00:11:02.650 --> 00:11:03.870
&gt;&gt;male #5: Multi-use

00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:04.870
&gt;&gt;Skurka: Multi-use.

00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:06.900
Come on.

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:08.670
A few others.

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:11.350
&gt;&gt;male #6: Just barely enough.

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:12.960
&gt;&gt;Skurka: Yeah, sure.

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:13.960
Sufficient.

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:14.960
Okay.

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:16.110
So let me run the list down.

00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:17.230
Functionality is important.

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:21.430
Comfort, efficiency, durability, reliability,
ease of use, value cost, and then lightweight,

00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:22.780
but not stupid light.

00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:28.300
These characteristics aren't that different
from what every other backpacker looks for.

00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:33.670
You still-- I think the ultimate hiker thing
oftentimes gets caught up in this lightweight

00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:35.670
backpacking thing, which I understand.

00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:39.089
But it's not all-- Don't be blinded by the
weight of an item.

00:11:39.089 --> 00:11:44.370
A great example of that would be I once did
a-- I was attempting a speed record on a Colorado

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:46.160
trail, which runs from Denver to Durango.

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:49.029
I expected it to take me about 11 days or
12 days.

00:11:49.029 --> 00:11:52.620
To save weight, I didn't carry a sleeping
bag.

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:58.730
[laughter] That's a great example of going
stupid light, because I didn't sleep at all

00:11:58.730 --> 00:12:00.970
the first three or four nights.

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:12.870
I was so incapacitated by not being recovered
at night that it undermined my entire efforts.

00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:15.889
The skills are what you carry between your
ears.

00:12:15.889 --> 00:12:19.380
For the ultimate hiker, skills are really
important because we're carrying a minimal

00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:20.380
amount of stuff.

00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:23.250
A lot of the stuff we use requires skills.

00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:28.139
So I need some interaction here.

00:12:28.139 --> 00:12:32.069
What are the skills that you need if you want
to carry down insulation instead of synthetic

00:12:32.069 --> 00:12:35.339
insulation, either in your sleeping bag or
a parka, what's the skill that you need?

00:12:35.339 --> 00:12:36.630
&gt;&gt;male #7: Keeping it dry.

00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:37.870
&gt;&gt;Skurka: You need to keep it dry.

00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:38.870
That's right.

00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:39.870
All right.

00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:41.990
If you're going to carry just enough food
and water instead of extra, what's the skill

00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:42.990
that you need?

00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:44.000
&gt;&gt;male #8: Planning.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.000
&gt;&gt;Skurka: Planning.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.339
And what was the other one?

00:12:46.339 --> 00:12:48.269
&gt;&gt;male #9: You need to know where water is.

00:12:48.269 --> 00:12:49.269
&gt;&gt;Skurka: You need to know where water is.

00:12:49.269 --> 00:12:50.269
Okay.

00:12:50.269 --> 00:12:52.509
If you're going to use a modular tarp system
instead of a double-walled tent, what's the

00:12:52.509 --> 00:12:53.509
skill?

00:12:53.509 --> 00:12:54.680
&gt;&gt;male #10: The right camp.

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:55.680
&gt;&gt;Skurka: Campsite selection.

00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:56.680
That's right.

00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:57.680
Right.

00:12:57.680 --> 00:12:58.680
And how to pitch it.

00:12:58.680 --> 00:12:59.680
Absolutely.

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:01.949
Because it's not just as easy as putting one
pole in, another pole in, and then pop, the

00:13:01.949 --> 00:13:02.949
whole thing goes.

00:13:02.949 --> 00:13:07.970
If you're going to carry a minimal first aid
kit instead of ambulance-worthy supplies,

00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:09.560
what are the skills?

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:15.079
&gt;&gt;male #11: Stay out of trouble.

00:13:15.079 --> 00:13:16.079
[laughter]

00:13:16.079 --> 00:13:17.079
&gt;&gt;Skurka: You know, everyone laughs, but that's
the best one.

00:13:17.079 --> 00:13:19.149
I try not to ever use my first aid kit.

00:13:19.149 --> 00:13:21.550
I don't want to be in a situation where I
have to use a first aid kit.

00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:23.100
So yes, it's decision making.

00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:29.129
And then certainly, if there is a first aid
situation, being resourceful and trying to

00:13:29.129 --> 00:13:30.370
make do with what you have.

00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:34.190
If you're going to take a map and compass
instead of a GPS, what's the skill?

00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:35.560
&gt;&gt;female #2: Navigation.

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:36.560
&gt;&gt;Skurka: Yeah.

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:39.620
Navigating, knowing how to find north, knowing
what a contour line means.

00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:41.560
I think you guys get the idea.

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:45.610
But what about this one: if you're going to
carry a closed cell foam pad instead of a

00:13:45.610 --> 00:13:48.269
plush inflatable, what's the skill?

00:13:48.269 --> 00:13:50.959
&gt;&gt;male #12: Campsite selection

00:13:50.959 --> 00:13:51.959
&gt;&gt;Skurka: Campsite selection.

00:13:51.959 --> 00:13:52.959
Yep. [knocking sound]

00:13:52.959 --> 00:13:53.959
&gt;&gt;male #13: Clothing.

00:13:53.959 --> 00:13:54.959
How to dress for it.

00:13:54.959 --> 00:13:55.959
&gt;&gt;Skurka: Right.

00:13:55.959 --> 00:13:56.959
Clothing would certainly help.

00:13:56.959 --> 00:14:01.080
And then the other one I've always heard is
how to take a sleeping pill, for that one.

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:03.870
[laughter] Which I wouldn't recommend.

00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:05.269
But it works.

00:14:05.269 --> 00:14:06.519
All right.

00:14:06.519 --> 00:14:10.350
Let's talk about these environmental and route
conditions.

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:17.589
Whenever I go on a trip, I do-- [laughs] Before
my Alaska-Yukon trip, I-- It took me, so it

00:14:17.589 --> 00:14:19.829
was a 6 month long trip, and it took me 6
months to plan.

00:14:19.829 --> 00:14:25.209
For about 5 months of that, it was basically:
the entire trip existed on my computer in

00:14:25.209 --> 00:14:35.569
an Excel spreadsheet, a National Geographic
topo mapping file, and a Google Earth file.

00:14:35.569 --> 00:14:40.529
But a lot of it was spent looking at these
conditions and understanding what I would

00:14:40.529 --> 00:14:42.959
need while I was out there.

00:14:42.959 --> 00:14:47.949
So we'll go through this list again very shortly,
but these are all the things that I look at

00:14:47.949 --> 00:14:52.240
that inform my decisions about the gear, supplies,
and skills that I need.

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:57.240
[sighs] So now we need to come up with a hypothetical
trip.

00:14:57.240 --> 00:15:02.220
I'm looking for suggestions about where we
should go, what time of year we should go,

00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:04.230
and for how long you guys want to go.

00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:08.310
Make a trip that everyone can relate to, so
don't say, "Baffin Island in January."

00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:10.800
&gt;&gt;male #14: Hiking Mt. Whitney.

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:12.300
&gt;&gt;Skurka: All right.

00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:13.300
Mt. Whitney.

00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:15.310
Okay, and how long do we want to go for?

00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:16.740
&gt;&gt;male #14: Two days?

00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:17.829
&gt;&gt;Skurka: Two days?

00:15:17.829 --> 00:15:19.959
Let's make it three.

00:15:19.959 --> 00:15:23.040
[laughter] How much vacation time do they
give you guys around here?

00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:24.850
[laughter] All right.

00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:26.060
Three days.

00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:28.790
What time of year would you like to go?

00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:30.339
&gt;&gt;male #14: Maybe August.

00:15:30.339 --> 00:15:31.339
&gt;&gt;Skurka: August.

00:15:31.339 --> 00:15:33.860
Does that sound good to everybody?

00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:35.259
Let's go in July.

00:15:35.259 --> 00:15:40.009
The bugs are worse in July, so that gives
me a little bit more-- August, the conditions

00:15:40.009 --> 00:15:42.480
are so good in the Sierra in August.

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:43.720
It's almost too easy.

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:47.870
You can go up there with not much more than
a pocketknife and some fire starter and you'll

00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:48.889
be okay.

00:15:48.889 --> 00:15:56.629
Okay. [laughter] I might have just exaggerated
that, sorry.

00:15:56.629 --> 00:15:58.360
All right.

00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:00.230
So let me go back to this slide.

00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:01.230
Okay.

00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:04.439
Now we're going to go climb Mt. Whitney and
maybe do a little bit more of a trip around

00:16:04.439 --> 00:16:05.439
Whitney.

00:16:05.439 --> 00:16:06.439
Three days in July.

00:16:06.439 --> 00:16:07.959
Let's go in the middle of July.

00:16:07.959 --> 00:16:11.320
Let's talk about the conditions that we're
going to encounter on this trip.

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:12.649
Let's start with temperatures.

00:16:12.649 --> 00:16:15.139
What are we looking at?

00:16:15.139 --> 00:16:18.079
70s, 80s?

00:16:18.079 --> 00:16:19.560
Probably.

00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:21.009
How would you find that out?

00:16:21.009 --> 00:16:22.499
&gt;&gt;female #3: [inaudible]

00:16:22.499 --> 00:16:23.499
&gt;&gt;Skurka: Exactly.

00:16:23.499 --> 00:16:26.260
You look up-- there are weather stations all
over the Sierra.

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:30.019
Look up-- find a weather station that's near
Mt. Whitney.

00:16:30.019 --> 00:16:31.830
Look at the historical weather data.

00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:38.009
Sometimes, you can find the range on it that
will give you a pretty good feel for what

00:16:38.009 --> 00:16:39.550
the temperatures will be like.

00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:43.769
What sort of precipitation will we have in
July near Mt. Whitney?

00:16:43.769 --> 00:16:46.220
&gt;&gt;male #15: [inaudible]

00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:48.670
&gt;&gt;Skurka: Well, maybe.

00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:50.589
If we do get rained on, what kind of rain
is it going to be?

00:16:50.589 --> 00:16:51.589
&gt;&gt;male #16: Thunderstorms.

00:16:51.589 --> 00:16:52.600
&gt;&gt;Skurka: It's going to be thunderstorms.

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:56.069
So we have to at least be planned for that
scenario.

00:16:56.069 --> 00:16:57.519
How much daylight do we have?

00:16:57.519 --> 00:16:59.790
Quite a bit.

00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:06.280
The reason that daylight affects the things
that I'll take with me is because I'm-- In

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:09.559
the summertime, for example, let's say I'm
in Alaska in June.

00:17:09.559 --> 00:17:12.659
I don't have to carry a headlamp with me.

00:17:12.659 --> 00:17:16.839
But then if I'm in Minnesota in January, then
the days are really short.

00:17:16.839 --> 00:17:22.260
I'm going to have to carry a lot of, a couple
of different lights, extra batteries.

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:26.370
I'll probably also take a slightly heavier
sleeping bag and clothing system because I'll

00:17:26.370 --> 00:17:30.860
spend a lot more time in camp and I won't
be relying on my body heat to keep me quite

00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:31.860
as warm.

00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:37.450
What sort of ground cover will we encounter
in terms of-- Is it going to be snow covered?

00:17:37.450 --> 00:17:39.169
Is it a nice, groomed trails?

00:17:39.169 --> 00:17:41.600
Are they rocky, or are they nice and soft?

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:44.070
What's it like up there?

00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:48.500
&gt;&gt;male #17: They have nice trails.

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:49.500
&gt;&gt;Skurka: Nice trails.

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:50.559
But they're pretty rocky.

00:17:50.559 --> 00:17:54.590
What about snow coverage in the middle of
July around Mt. Whitney?

00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:56.409
&gt;&gt;male #18: Some near the top.

00:17:56.409 --> 00:17:57.409
&gt;&gt;Skurka: Some near the top.

00:17:57.409 --> 00:17:59.510
But enough where you-- Are you going to need
skis or snowshoes?

00:17:59.510 --> 00:18:00.510
Okay.

00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:01.600
And again, you could find that out.

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:06.620
There's a-- The government runs a National
Snow Analyses and you can look it up.

00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:10.799
You can see where the snow coverage is at
a given time of year.

00:18:10.799 --> 00:18:13.600
What sort of vegetation is there?

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:17.700
It depends on the elevation.

00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:19.059
You could get some pine.

00:18:19.059 --> 00:18:21.090
A little bit higher up, what happens?

00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:22.350
&gt;&gt;male #19: Over the tree line.

00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:23.960
&gt;&gt;Skurka: Yeah, you're over the tree line.

00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:25.690
So what's the sun exposure like up there?

00:18:25.690 --> 00:18:26.690
&gt;&gt;male #20: Hot.

00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:27.690
&gt;&gt;Skurka: It's intense.

00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:30.900
You're at 13, 14,000 feet.

00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:33.830
There's no shading, so you better be prepared
for that.

00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:37.260
How much water is there in the middle of July
around Mt. Whitney?

00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:38.770
Lots, yes.

00:18:38.770 --> 00:18:42.799
You probably-- You won't have to carry much
water, if any at all.

00:18:42.799 --> 00:18:44.340
And wildlife?

00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:48.630
&gt;&gt;male #21: Mosquitoes.

00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:50.860
&gt;&gt;Skurka: I heard mosquitoes.

00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:52.710
You'll definitely have mosquitoes.

00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:56.280
Anybody been in peak mosquito season up in
the Sierra?

00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:57.280
Raise your hand.

00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:59.970
Well, we can all sympathize for each other.

00:18:59.970 --> 00:19:01.350
They get pretty bad.

00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:02.730
So you'd want to be prepared for that.

00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:04.080
Then, what about the wildlife?

00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:05.210
&gt;&gt;male #22: Bears.

00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:06.340
&gt;&gt;Skurka: That's right.

00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:07.340
There are bears.

00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:09.970
Are the bears problematic in the Sierra?

00:19:09.970 --> 00:19:11.940
They are definitely problematic.

00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:16.090
If you look up-- Go to the Sierra Kings Canyon
National Park website.

00:19:16.090 --> 00:19:18.760
They'll tell you, "Yes, bears are a problem
here.

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:23.090
We require all people who are climbing or
all backpackers who are going up Mt. Whitney

00:19:23.090 --> 00:19:24.210
to carry a bear canister."

00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:25.210
Etc, etc.

00:19:25.210 --> 00:19:26.210
All right.

00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:28.010
How remote is Mt. Whitney?

00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:34.820
[pause] It's more remote than here, but--
Are you going to have cell reception if you

00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:35.820
get hurt?

00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:40.140
Is someone going to come up on you within
half an hour?

00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:41.140
What's the--

00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:42.140
&gt;&gt;male #23: Yeah.

00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:46.299
&gt;&gt;Skurka: Yeah, it's a heavily traveled area.

00:19:46.299 --> 00:19:48.260
You're not going to need a satellite phone.

00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:50.780
Your cell phone actually will work from the
top of Mt. Whitney because you're looking

00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:52.950
right down on Lone Pine.

00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:55.840
Then, any natural hazards we need to be worried
about?

00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:57.990
Big river fords, lightning, avalanches?

00:19:57.990 --> 00:19:59.929
Anything like that?

00:19:59.929 --> 00:20:01.870
&gt;&gt;male #24: Lightning.

00:20:01.870 --> 00:20:03.720
&gt;&gt;Skurka: Lightning is definitely a concern.

00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:06.929
I don't think there are, depending on the
route that you're picking, there probably

00:20:06.929 --> 00:20:10.250
are not big river ford problems on this trip.

00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:14.750
Okay, so let's talk about everything that
I would take with me on this trip.

00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:17.340
I'm going to step away from this.

00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:24.360
So we'll start off with clothing.

00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:33.910
[pause] Clothing system typically has three
different pieces to it.

00:20:33.910 --> 00:20:37.950
Each piece has a specific purpose, but there's
always a little bit of overlap.

00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:41.960
You have active layers, you have insulation,
and you have shells.

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:49.159
Your active layers are designed to manage
moisture, protect your skin against sun, brush,

00:20:49.159 --> 00:20:50.880
bugs, and also to give you a little bit of
modesty.

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:56.789
The clothing system I would take with me on
this trip, or the active layer I'd take with

00:20:56.789 --> 00:21:00.649
me on this trip-- I'll start off with the
top part.

00:21:00.649 --> 00:21:06.010
Because I'm going to be dealing with bugs,
I would take a woven polyester nylon shirt.

00:21:06.010 --> 00:21:12.480
The bugs have a harder time biting through
a woven fabric, which is different [pause]

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:16.500
which is different than, say, this knit shirt,
like the polyester knit shirt.

00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:19.059
The bugs will bite right through this.

00:21:19.059 --> 00:21:20.530
You can oftentimes find these woven shirts.

00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:25.840
They look like safari shirts or travel shirts,
but they're great for bugs.

00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:27.460
I would also make sure it's long sleeved.

00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:32.350
Not only for the bug protection, but also
to protect my arms against the sun as well.

00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:40.000
On my bottoms, I would probably wear a pair
of lightweight polyester wool underwear.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.649
Boxer briefs would be fine, they're really
light.

00:21:41.649 --> 00:21:44.409
And then a pair of nylon woven tracking pants
like this.

00:21:44.409 --> 00:21:46.730
Again, this would be great for the bugs.

00:21:46.730 --> 00:21:48.809
It keeps the sun off my legs.

00:21:48.809 --> 00:21:53.871
And, if I was going to be doing any off trail
travel, the pants are really nice when you're

00:21:53.871 --> 00:21:55.220
beating through the brush as well.

00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:58.510
Your legs won't get all chopped up.

00:21:58.510 --> 00:22:04.770
If it were a different time of year, say if
you were going later in the fall, like the

00:22:04.770 --> 00:22:09.710
end of August or September, I might at that
point just go with a short sleeved merino

00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:13.149
wool or a polyester shirt like this one here,
or a long sleeve.

00:22:13.149 --> 00:22:16.630
This tends to breathe a lot better, so it's
not quite as stuffy because the fabric isn't

00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:18.380
quite as tight.

00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:20.480
But the bugs will bite right through this.

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:24.559
I wouldn't take this out until the bugs are
pretty much gone.

00:22:24.559 --> 00:22:28.460
Any questions about what I would wear during
the day?

00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:33.350
Okay, I'll keep on moving then.

00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:36.559
The second layer that I'd take with me are
shells.

00:22:36.559 --> 00:22:40.279
There are two different types of shells.

00:22:40.279 --> 00:22:44.630
There's what the industry calls a water resistant
shell, like this one here.

00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:47.870
And then there's what the industry calls a
waterproof breathable shell, like this one

00:22:47.870 --> 00:22:49.420
here.

00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:52.940
Let me give you a different interpretation
for these types of shells.

00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:57.409
Water resistant, to me, means that it's fairly
breathable, which means that moisture can

00:22:57.409 --> 00:22:58.799
move through the fabric.

00:22:58.799 --> 00:23:00.250
But it's not water resistant.

00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:01.710
Just get over it.

00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:06.870
If you get stuck in a rainstorm wearing just
the wind shirt, you're going to get wet.

00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:11.520
The reason that they say that it's water resistant
is because when they make it in the factory,

00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:16.120
there's a coating on here that's called a
durable water repellent finish, but it gets

00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:21.130
degraded very quickly due to abrasion, body
oils, sweat, dirt.

00:23:21.130 --> 00:23:23.990
So it quickly loses its effectiveness.

00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:31.320
This is nice for windy summits, for very,
very light rain, for dry snow.

00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:33.700
The wind shell works pretty well.

00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:39.870
Then the waterproof breathable shell, everyone
knows these by the brand name Gore-Tex.

00:23:39.870 --> 00:23:44.570
This I would describe as barely breathable,
so it's like wearing a plastic bag.

00:23:44.570 --> 00:23:46.269
It's water resistant for a while.

00:23:46.269 --> 00:23:49.059
It basically will delay you getting wet.

00:23:49.059 --> 00:23:53.350
But this is a good time to point out that
you're outdoors.

00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:55.029
There's no way to control the climate.

00:23:55.029 --> 00:24:00.279
You have to have some realistic expectations
about what your gear can and cannot do.

00:24:00.279 --> 00:24:03.710
My experience is that when it's wet outside,
I'm going to get wet.

00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:10.730
There are some things that I can do to minimize
or prolong getting wet and also try to be

00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:12.880
comfortable when wet, but I'm going to get
wet.

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:15.660
So just get over that.

00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:22.559
For this trip here, I would probably take,
in August, I would probably just take the

00:24:22.559 --> 00:24:25.929
wind shell, or the waterproof breathable shell.

00:24:25.929 --> 00:24:28.519
If I get caught in a storm, that's going to
be pretty short lived.

00:24:28.519 --> 00:24:29.519
I can put this on.

00:24:29.519 --> 00:24:32.210
It will keep me comfortable for an hour.

00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:34.289
After an hour, the storm is going to leave
and I can take this off.

00:24:34.289 --> 00:24:37.470
I probably won't-- I might be a little bit
wet inside, but no big deal.

00:24:37.470 --> 00:24:40.980
That night, I can start a fire and dry out.

00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:46.240
Any questions about waterproof breathable
shells, or shells in general?

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:47.240
Yes.

00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:52.220
&gt;&gt;male #25: About hard shells and soft shells

00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:57.029
&gt;&gt;Skurka: You might have heard water resistant
shells described as a soft shell, and waterproof

00:24:57.029 --> 00:24:59.519
breathable shells described as hard shells.

00:24:59.519 --> 00:25:01.309
It's just synonymous.

00:25:01.309 --> 00:25:02.309
Yes.

00:25:02.309 --> 00:25:06.539
&gt;&gt;male #26: Related to water, people have
umbrellas.

00:25:06.539 --> 00:25:10.769
I heard some people using umbrellas and trading
that way.

00:25:10.769 --> 00:25:11.769
&gt;&gt;Skurka: Right.

00:25:11.769 --> 00:25:14.820
Umbrella's definitely another way to go.

00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:18.690
Umbrellas work really well because of excellent
ventilation.

00:25:18.690 --> 00:25:25.950
[laughter] But imagine being caught say at
13,000 feet in a thunderstorm and you only

00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:27.150
have an umbrella.

00:25:27.150 --> 00:25:28.710
Remember Mary Poppins?

00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:33.830
[laughter] Then, I also don't like umbrellas
because I like trekking poles.

00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:35.460
Trekking poles aren't compatible with an umbrella.

00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:40.960
But umbrellas are also great out in the desert,
just to keep the sun off of you.

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:46.020
You can find umbrellas that have a-- It's
a radiant heat reflector.

00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:48.600
It's that silvery space blanket material.

00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:49.720
What's it called?

00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:50.840
&gt;&gt;male #27: Mylar.

00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:51.970
&gt;&gt;Skurka: Mylar, yeah.

00:25:51.970 --> 00:25:55.570
So I know a lot of people who are big fans
from there, but again, I don't like it because,

00:25:55.570 --> 00:25:58.080
as I'm carrying it, I can feel it holding
me back.

00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:04.230
Like a race car at the end of a drag strip,
where the parachute goes out.

00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:08.460
I don't want to lose-- I don't want to have
my pace dropped down from 3.3 miles an hour

00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:09.610
to 3.2.

00:26:09.610 --> 00:26:11.909
That'd be a tragedy.

00:26:11.909 --> 00:26:16.390
[laughter] Hey, that makes a big difference
when you're hiking 6800 miles.

00:26:16.390 --> 00:26:20.100
Okay, then the last layer that I would take
with me is insulation.

00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:25.000
There are a couple of different types of insulated
layers you could take.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.450
Fleece, like this here.

00:26:26.450 --> 00:26:33.159
Or you could take a category I refer to as
puffies, which are-- It's a really thin or

00:26:33.159 --> 00:26:38.180
lightweight shell fabric, really lightweight
interior fabric, and then sandwiched between

00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:44.000
is either a synthetic insulation like PrimaLoft
or Climashield, or a goose down, which is

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.779
just a little film of goose down.

00:26:46.779 --> 00:26:52.360
For the West, because it's so dry, I highly
recommend down as opposed to synthetic.

00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:55.490
It's a lot lighter for its-- It's much warmer
for its weight.

00:26:55.490 --> 00:26:57.890
It's longer lasting.

00:26:57.890 --> 00:26:59.750
It's more compressible.

00:26:59.750 --> 00:27:01.900
It's also not made of plastic.

00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:05.899
And then, the fleece layers don't really make
that much sense here in the American West

00:27:05.899 --> 00:27:09.750
either because they're pretty heavy for the
amount of weight that they-- for the amount

00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:11.799
of warmth that they give you.

00:27:11.799 --> 00:27:14.950
The one time I recommend fleece is in the
shoulder seasons around here, where you could

00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:18.429
be up in the Sierras in October and you can
get cold and wet.

00:27:18.429 --> 00:27:22.190
In which case fleece will do a much better
job of retaining its warmth when it's wet

00:27:22.190 --> 00:27:24.840
than a puffy jacket like this one here.

00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:28.309
Now oftentimes you hear people talk about
synthetic insulations, and they say, "Well,

00:27:28.309 --> 00:27:30.580
they're-- synthetic insulations stay warm
when they're wet."

00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:35.470
Nothing stays warm when it's wet.

00:27:35.470 --> 00:27:39.549
My experience is that synthetic insulations
don't-- I'm sorry, down doesn't get wet from

00:27:39.549 --> 00:27:47.060
me dropping it in a river or not protecting
the items in my pack from rainstorms.

00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:48.730
Down gets wet because it absorbs ambient humidity.

00:27:48.730 --> 00:27:53.800
In humid environments like the East Coast,
they don't work that well because they're

00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:58.139
always absorbing that humidity, whereas here
in the West, it's usually really low humidity,

00:27:58.139 --> 00:28:03.520
so down stays pretty dry and it's a really
effective insulator.

00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:05.400
Any questions on insulation?

00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:06.450
No?

00:28:06.450 --> 00:28:09.932
[pause]
All right, let's jump to footwear.

00:28:09.932 --> 00:28:15.250
The footwear I would use on a trip like this--
Does anyone have a pair of hiking shoes?

00:28:15.250 --> 00:28:22.370
[pause] Like a pair of Merrells.

00:28:22.370 --> 00:28:25.909
Probably not.

00:28:25.909 --> 00:28:26.909
I see.

00:28:26.909 --> 00:28:27.909
I'll take these.

00:28:27.909 --> 00:28:29.100
Okay. [laughter] All right.

00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:32.460
The pair of shoes that I would normally recommend
is a pair of lightweight trail running shoes.

00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:37.950
These are a little bit skimpy for a backpacking
trip, but the reason I like trail running

00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:41.750
shoes is because they're comfortable to put
on right out of the box.

00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:43.139
They breathe really well so they're not hot.

00:28:43.139 --> 00:28:45.850
They don't trap all my foot perspiration.

00:28:45.850 --> 00:28:49.549
They dry out really fast once they get wet.

00:28:49.549 --> 00:28:50.610
And they're also much lighter weight.

00:28:50.610 --> 00:28:53.230
In the militaries-- I've seen the studies
on this.

00:28:53.230 --> 00:28:58.279
The military has done studies where they figured
out that one extra pound on your foot is equivalent

00:28:58.279 --> 00:29:01.909
to carrying an extra six pounds on your back
in terms of effort, because you're always

00:29:01.909 --> 00:29:03.159
swinging your feet.

00:29:03.159 --> 00:29:08.590
Your feet move a lot more, so there's a lot
more effort involved in moving them.

00:29:08.590 --> 00:29:12.000
If you're not willing to go to a trail running
shoe, and again, I wouldn't recommend something

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.190
this skimpy, but something just a little bit
burlier, then you can go with a-- this is

00:29:16.190 --> 00:29:19.070
more of a hiking boot.

00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:22.389
But something like a low cut version of this
works pretty well too.

00:29:22.389 --> 00:29:25.070
It's fairly supportive, good protection.

00:29:25.070 --> 00:29:30.570
It's pretty durable, but still much lighter
weight than your conventional backpacking

00:29:30.570 --> 00:29:31.580
boots.

00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:36.179
Italian-made leather waffle stompers.

00:29:36.179 --> 00:29:39.710
I recommend going with a non waterproof shoe.

00:29:39.710 --> 00:29:45.410
My experience is that when it's wet outside,
there's nothing I can do about keeping anything

00:29:45.410 --> 00:29:46.720
about me dry.

00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:52.190
For example, if I were to wear a waterproof
shoe, when it's not wet, my foot is going

00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:55.820
to be-- A lot of the perspiration from my
foot is going to be trapped in that shoe.

00:29:55.820 --> 00:30:00.179
And when it does get wet, like if I have to
ford a creek or if I'm in a rainstorm and

00:30:00.179 --> 00:30:03.649
water drips down my legs, then it takes a
long time for that waterproof shoe or boot

00:30:03.649 --> 00:30:05.070
to get dry.

00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:08.830
So it's much better just to go with a non
waterproof shoe that dries fast and that squeegees

00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:10.200
the water out.

00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:13.980
And then you have to deal with the issue of
just having wet feet.

00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:17.419
Let me skip a few slides.

00:30:17.419 --> 00:30:22.919
There are a few things that I-- I wasn't dealing
very well with wet feet that day.

00:30:22.919 --> 00:30:27.620
There are a few things that I do as far as
foot care goes.

00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:31.860
First thing, I always try to preemptively
treat my feet.

00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:38.159
If I notice a hot spot coming on, immediately,
I stop and I take care of it, before it goes

00:30:38.159 --> 00:30:39.860
into a full fledged blister.

00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:43.870
If you start getting blistered, your trip
is greatly curtailed.

00:30:43.870 --> 00:30:45.789
It's just too painful to be walking on blisters.

00:30:45.789 --> 00:30:49.250
So really be proactive about your foot care.

00:30:49.250 --> 00:30:53.491
I also try to keep my feet, to the best of
my ability, clean, warm, and dry.

00:30:53.491 --> 00:30:56.130
I wash my socks.

00:30:56.130 --> 00:31:00.460
Usually in the West here I carry two pairs
of socks.

00:31:00.460 --> 00:31:02.940
I won't show you these, I won't pass these
around.

00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:06.269
But just a pair of thin cycling socks.

00:31:06.269 --> 00:31:11.190
I carry two pairs and I'll wear the first
pair through midday.

00:31:11.190 --> 00:31:14.019
Then I'll stop and I'll put on my other pair.

00:31:14.019 --> 00:31:17.010
I'll take that pair I was wearing the first
half of the day and I'll wash it and I'll

00:31:17.010 --> 00:31:18.880
put it on the outside of my pack to dry.

00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:24.100
But the time I arrive in camp, it's dry, it's
clean, and I can wear it to bed.

00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:27.210
I also try to make sure that my feet are warm
at night.

00:31:27.210 --> 00:31:30.460
In this photo here, my feet-- This was in
the Alaska range.

00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:32.519
My feet had been wet for about 12, 13 hours.

00:31:32.519 --> 00:31:34.669
I was wearing a pair of leather ski boots.

00:31:34.669 --> 00:31:39.830
My feet, when I got up the next morning, were
totally fine because I gave them 9 hours where

00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:42.610
they were dry, they were warm.

00:31:42.610 --> 00:31:46.419
I was able to pound on them all day long the
next day, despite them looking like this when

00:31:46.419 --> 00:31:47.740
I pulled into camp.

00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:53.649
And then, because my feet are oftentimes wet,
I have to figure out how to deal with moisture.

00:31:53.649 --> 00:31:58.820
[rustling sound in background] The thing that
I recommend is-- There are a couple of different

00:31:58.820 --> 00:31:59.820
things you can use.

00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:03.220
What I've been using recently is a wax-based
balm.

00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:06.460
It's a company called Bonnie's Balm.

00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:13.019
I put this on my feet at night after they
have dried out, and let the wax or the oils

00:32:13.019 --> 00:32:15.179
absorb into my skin.

00:32:15.179 --> 00:32:19.009
The next day, what that does is it basically
keeps some of the water out, and it also keeps

00:32:19.009 --> 00:32:20.450
my foot moisturized.

00:32:20.450 --> 00:32:22.570
The problem with wet feet is that your feet
get macerated.

00:32:22.570 --> 00:32:23.990
They get pruny.

00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:24.990
They get soft.

00:32:24.990 --> 00:32:26.360
They're prone to blistering.

00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:30.799
Wax like this will really help to minimize
that.

00:32:30.799 --> 00:32:36.600
It won't eliminate it, but it will allow you
to deal with wet feet like this.

00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:42.909
Then the final thing about footwear: I always
try-- I never try new footwear in a high risk

00:32:42.909 --> 00:32:43.909
environment.

00:32:43.909 --> 00:32:47.000
If I'm going to go on a long trip, I'm going
to have gone on a short trip before then,

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:50.059
just to make sure that my footwear system,
my socks and my shoes, are good.

00:32:50.059 --> 00:32:52.710
&gt;&gt;male #28: Quick question about that.

00:32:52.710 --> 00:32:53.710
&gt;&gt;Skurka: Yes.

00:32:53.710 --> 00:33:01.200
&gt;&gt;male #28: When you're going on a 5000 mile
hike, I'm assuming you have one pair of shoes

00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:02.200
if it doesn't hold up, that you have--

00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:06.539
&gt;&gt;Skurka: One pair of shoes is not enough
for a 5000 mile trip, correct.

00:33:06.539 --> 00:33:10.590
I rely on the US Postal system.

00:33:10.590 --> 00:33:16.050
Before my trip, I figure out all these resupply
points, and then I, before I leave, I box

00:33:16.050 --> 00:33:22.789
up a bunch of food and new supplies and shoes
and I mail it out to myself.

00:33:22.789 --> 00:33:28.070
The pair of shoes that I was using on my Alaska
trip would last me for about 450 miles, give

00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:30.200
or take, depending on the conditions.

00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:34.840
I would just, approximately every 450 miles,
find a place to ship myself a new pair of

00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:35.840
shoes.

00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:37.360
&gt;&gt;male #29: Your mom helped you there, right?

00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:38.360
&gt;&gt;Skurka: Right.

00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:40.909
[laughs] If you're going to do one of these
long distance trips, definitely find yourself

00:33:40.909 --> 00:33:47.179
a sympathetic spouse or mother who is willing
to send you all this stuff.

00:33:47.179 --> 00:33:52.500
Make sure that she's a good baker too, because
receiving chocolate chip cookies [laughter]

00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:56.909
in the mail after a long, hard trip is really
wonderful.

00:33:56.909 --> 00:33:58.539
All right.

00:33:58.539 --> 00:34:04.770
I told you a little bit about the socks, but
I generally prefer real wool socks as opposed

00:34:04.770 --> 00:34:05.770
to polyester.

00:34:05.770 --> 00:34:09.079
They deal with the funk a lot better than
polyester does.

00:34:09.079 --> 00:34:11.480
Just a lightweight pair of socks.

00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:12.480
That's enough for me.

00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:15.060
But some people might need a little more,
something a little bit thicker to give themselves

00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:16.470
a little bit more cushioning.

00:34:16.470 --> 00:34:23.750
Then I'd recommend using a [rustling sound]
really small gaiter like this one here.

00:34:23.750 --> 00:34:26.790
Some people look at gaiters and they say,
"Well, you're adding weight to your footwear

00:34:26.790 --> 00:34:27.790
system."

00:34:27.790 --> 00:34:31.290
This is a good example where I'm being more
efficient by using a pair of gaiters, because

00:34:31.290 --> 00:34:34.520
I'm having to stop far less often to get stuff
out of my shoes.

00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:39.270
And also, it keeps my feet cleaner, so that's
better for long term health and long term

00:34:39.270 --> 00:34:40.270
success.

00:34:40.270 --> 00:34:41.270
All right.

00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:42.270
We're going to skip through here.

00:34:42.270 --> 00:34:43.270
Any other questions about footwear?

00:34:43.270 --> 00:34:44.270
Yes.

00:34:44.270 --> 00:34:46.370
&gt;&gt;female #3: What if you're walking through
the snow?

00:34:46.370 --> 00:34:50.409
Is that when you want the waterproof?

00:34:50.409 --> 00:34:51.570
&gt;&gt;Skurka: Right.

00:34:51.570 --> 00:34:55.700
If you're walking in snow, it depends on the
consistency of the snow.

00:34:55.700 --> 00:35:00.280
If it's really wet snow, like in the springtime,
if you're wearing a pair of waterproof shoes,

00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:02.589
your shoes are still going to get wet.

00:35:02.589 --> 00:35:06.210
So I would just go with non waterproof shoes.

00:35:06.210 --> 00:35:09.420
Your feet get wet, they get cold for a while.

00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:14.980
It's tough, but you've got to deal with it.

00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:26.310
&gt;&gt;female #3: So it's more a question of comfort
rather than-- like, comfort to your feet?

00:35:26.310 --> 00:35:27.310
&gt;&gt;male #30: Soft will make it more comfortable

00:35:27.310 --> 00:35:28.310
&gt;&gt;Skurka: I guess.

00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:29.310
Let me explain it this way.

00:35:29.310 --> 00:35:32.630
If you have a pair of waterproof shoes, I
would argue that in prolonged wet conditions,

00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:34.970
your feet are going to get wet.

00:35:34.970 --> 00:35:35.970
It's inevitable.

00:35:35.970 --> 00:35:37.579
You will have to ford a creek.

00:35:37.579 --> 00:35:43.060
You will be walking on snow all day long or
frequently enough.

00:35:43.060 --> 00:35:49.260
That waterproof breathable material is not
indefinitely waterproof.

00:35:49.260 --> 00:35:51.740
Water can and does move into the fabric.

00:35:51.740 --> 00:35:54.580
And you also have this big hole for where
your ankle is.

00:35:54.580 --> 00:35:56.420
So your feet are still going to get wet.

00:35:56.420 --> 00:36:03.930
At that point, I'd just as soon have the non
waterproof shoes, which would dry a lot faster,

00:36:03.930 --> 00:36:08.741
they're lighter weight, they're not as hot,
because they don't trap all that heat and

00:36:08.741 --> 00:36:10.990
moisture inside my shoe.

00:36:10.990 --> 00:36:16.210
I think the bottom line is instead of trying
to keep your feet dry, it's better off trying

00:36:16.210 --> 00:36:19.290
to figure out how to minimize the effects
of wet feet.

00:36:19.290 --> 00:36:26.052
&gt;&gt;male #31: What conditions are best for ankle
coverage?

00:36:26.052 --> 00:36:28.960
&gt;&gt;Skurka: Regarding the ankle support, that's
always the thing with boots.

00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:33.720
The way I look at boots: if you have a really
stiff boot, let's say you're wearing a ski

00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:34.830
boot.

00:36:34.830 --> 00:36:39.230
Your body still has to react to any abnormality
on the surface.

00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:42.650
If you step on a rock and you're in a ski
boot, your whole knee is going to go like

00:36:42.650 --> 00:36:44.800
this because some part of your body has to
absorb it.

00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:49.630
So naturally or biomechanically, our ankles
are designed to absorb that stuff and to keep

00:36:49.630 --> 00:36:51.220
us balanced.

00:36:51.220 --> 00:36:55.900
If your ankles aren't strong enough yet to
support you and walking on that trail with

00:36:55.900 --> 00:37:00.440
your backpack, then you might want to go for
something that does have some ankle protection.

00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:03.650
But the ideal thing is definitely to let your
ankles do that work.

00:37:03.650 --> 00:37:06.732
&gt;&gt;male #32: How do you know when your ankles
are strong enough?

00:37:06.732 --> 00:37:08.619
&gt;&gt;Skurka: How do you know when your ankles
are strong enough?

00:37:08.619 --> 00:37:10.760
That's a personal decision.

00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:14.369
If you go up there-- I don't know, give it
a shot.

00:37:14.369 --> 00:37:17.320
Bring a pair of trail running shoes, and if
you're carrying a lightweight pack and you

00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:21.400
feel totally comfortable, then you're apparently
strong enough.

00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:26.000
Maybe go on a day hike with just a pair of
trail running shoes and see what it's like.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:29.961
Then maybe go on a one week trip or two week
trip with a pair of trail running shoes, after

00:37:29.961 --> 00:37:31.040
you've proven them.

00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:32.040
[pause]

00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:37.740
&gt;&gt;male #33: Do you have any suggestion for
sole material?

00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:38.740
I find vibram very slippery.

00:37:38.740 --> 00:37:41.089
&gt;&gt;Skurka: So, recommendations for sole material.

00:37:41.089 --> 00:37:45.460
You can't really choose your-- it's not like
tires, where it's like, "Okay, I have a Toyota,

00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:46.880
but I want Goodyear tires."

00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:48.849
You take what you get.

00:37:48.849 --> 00:37:52.220
I think there are a lot of good rubbers out
there nowadays.

00:37:52.220 --> 00:37:56.700
There're definitely some rubbers that don't
have the trade offs that they used to.

00:37:56.700 --> 00:38:00.450
It used to be that if you wanted a sticky
rubber, it wasn't durable.

00:38:00.450 --> 00:38:03.400
But if you wanted a hard rubber, then it wasn't
sticky.

00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:05.550
So there's some rubbers that do a better job.

00:38:05.550 --> 00:38:09.490
I tend to wear-- I have been wearing La Sportiva
shoes for a while now.

00:38:09.490 --> 00:38:11.589
They do a pretty good job in that combination.

00:38:11.589 --> 00:38:15.020
But it's something you have to find out the
hard way.

00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:19.320
Then, once you find a pair of shoes that you
really like, buy 10 pairs of them, because

00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:22.560
you know that they're going to change the
model next year.

00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:24.961
And you'll be on the search again.

00:38:24.961 --> 00:38:25.961
Yes.

00:38:25.961 --> 00:38:32.130
&gt;&gt;female #4: Could you still use like trail
runner shoes for an extended trip, like a

00:38:32.130 --> 00:38:33.930
month of hiking, with a 30 pound pack.

00:38:33.930 --> 00:38:35.119
&gt;&gt;Skurka: With how heavy of a pack?

00:38:35.119 --> 00:38:36.619
&gt;&gt;female #4: Maybe 30 pounds.

00:38:36.619 --> 00:38:37.619
&gt;&gt;Skurka: Sure.

00:38:37.619 --> 00:38:40.890
Yes, I would still wear trail running shoes
with a 30 pound pack on an extended trip.

00:38:40.890 --> 00:38:42.660
I'm not sure if you were around for that.

00:38:42.660 --> 00:38:45.650
That first slide was a photo from my Alaska
trip.

00:38:45.650 --> 00:38:52.690
It was a 24 day stretch, 657 miles without
seeing any other human being, without crossing

00:38:52.690 --> 00:38:58.109
roads, and I had on a pair of trail running
shoes that weren't much more robust than this.

00:38:58.109 --> 00:39:02.130
When I left, when I started that section,
I was carrying two weeks of food.

00:39:02.130 --> 00:39:04.349
My whole pack weighed about 45 pounds.

00:39:04.349 --> 00:39:08.980
So it's doable, but-- Hopefully one of the
things I come across in the presentation is

00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:10.920
that this isn't my way or the highway.

00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:14.720
You need to make your own decisions based
on your own experience and your own strengths,

00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:16.240
weaknesses, comforts.

00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:20.650
If you want to try a pair of trail runners
for a month on that sort of trip, go for it.

00:39:20.650 --> 00:39:24.869
But if you're really stuck on boots because
you know they work for you, I'd say just go

00:39:24.869 --> 00:39:25.900
with it.

00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:32.400
&gt;&gt;male #34: So it all relates to the issue?

00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:33.400
&gt;&gt;Skurka: We'll get there.

00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:34.400
Let me-- I'll keep going.

00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:35.630
It's a few more slides.

00:39:35.630 --> 00:39:39.420
Let me keep on moving on on some of this stuff.

00:39:39.420 --> 00:39:46.470
After my-- We've done clothing, we've done
footwear, so we'll go to sleep systems.

00:39:46.470 --> 00:39:51.780
Unfortunately, I-- The sleeping bag that I
would take with me on this trip, because we're

00:39:51.780 --> 00:39:55.310
here in August, it's in the high Sierra.

00:39:55.310 --> 00:39:59.520
I would take with me a down insulated sleeping
quilt, which is a lot different than your

00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:01.490
traditional mummy bag.

00:40:01.490 --> 00:40:02.619
It's got this open back.

00:40:02.619 --> 00:40:05.951
The reason I like these sleeping quilts as
opposed to the mummies is because it's a lot

00:40:05.951 --> 00:40:07.160
more versatile.

00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:10.040
It's also a little bit lighter because you
don't have any of this material in the back

00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:11.040
here.

00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:15.030
But the nice thing about a mummy is that say
if it's a really warm night, I get to loosely

00:40:15.030 --> 00:40:16.720
drape the quilt on top of me.

00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:24.410
But if it's a really cold night, [pause] then
I can button this up, and there's a draw cord

00:40:24.410 --> 00:40:27.220
I can cinch tight.

00:40:27.220 --> 00:40:29.309
That would also keep me comfortable.

00:40:29.309 --> 00:40:34.000
As far as the temperature selection of this
quilt, this quilt, they say it's technically

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.819
rated to 20 degrees, but that's not quite
true.

00:40:36.819 --> 00:40:41.760
I would say, if I were to sleep-- Let's go
back to my clothing system here.

00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:51.250
[pause] If I were to sleep, say, in my underwear
and my shirt, I'm comfortable in this sleeping

00:40:51.250 --> 00:40:54.589
bag down to about, say, 35 degrees.

00:40:54.589 --> 00:41:04.420
But then, if I also wear my pants, and I wear
my insulated parka, now I'm good down to about

00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:05.920
20, 25 degrees.

00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:11.170
I look at my sleep system as part of the system
that keeps me warm at night, but it's not

00:41:11.170 --> 00:41:12.680
the only thing I rely on.

00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:17.020
I'm trying to eliminate some redundancies
between these different categories, between

00:41:17.020 --> 00:41:19.440
these different gear systems.

00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:24.690
Then, for a sleeping pad, I would-- [rustling
sound] I'm not sure where it went.

00:41:24.690 --> 00:41:27.460
I had a-- Usually, I recommend a closed cell
foam pad.

00:41:27.460 --> 00:41:31.069
The limitation of a closed cell foam pad is
that they're not that comfortable if you sleep

00:41:31.069 --> 00:41:34.540
on a really hard surface, because they're
only, say, 5/8 of an inch thick.

00:41:34.540 --> 00:41:37.280
You need to find a good, soft campsite.

00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:40.270
If you don't want to do that, or if you just
insist on carrying a little bit of luxury,

00:41:40.270 --> 00:41:43.670
then you can take an air pad like this one.

00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:44.740
This weighs 9 ounces.

00:41:44.740 --> 00:41:46.630
It's about an inch thick.

00:41:46.630 --> 00:41:51.230
You probably would still want to sleep on
something soft, even with this pad.

00:41:51.230 --> 00:41:59.280
Then you'll notice it's only a-- [pause] It's
also only torso length.

00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:04.690
At night, what I do is I take my backpack
and I put that down at my feet.

00:42:04.690 --> 00:42:07.640
The padding of the backpack will keep my lower
half warm.

00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:16.130
And also, because I'm sleeping on a soft surface,
say, pine needles, leaves, moss, that's not

00:42:16.130 --> 00:42:18.359
a surface that's really thermally conductive.

00:42:18.359 --> 00:42:23.590
It's not like hard-packed, wet ground that
seems to really just suck the warmth out of

00:42:23.590 --> 00:42:24.590
you.

00:42:24.590 --> 00:42:26.280
Any questions on sleep systems?

00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:28.800
All right, let's jump to shelters.

00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:34.550
I'm going to need a few [rustling sounds]
a few volunteers here.

00:42:34.550 --> 00:42:36.940
Can I have one, two, three, four.

00:42:36.940 --> 00:42:37.940
Five, six.

00:42:37.940 --> 00:42:39.560
Or maybe, if you have your computer.

00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:40.560
Can I get in here?

00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:43.941
There are a couple of different shelters that
I might use for this sort of trip.

00:42:43.941 --> 00:42:44.941
[rustling continues] Actually, I'm going to
bring you over here.

00:42:44.941 --> 00:42:45.941
[pause] All right.

00:42:45.941 --> 00:42:46.941
[pause] Hold this.

00:42:46.941 --> 00:42:47.941
This one here.

00:42:47.941 --> 00:42:49.869
All right.

00:42:49.869 --> 00:42:59.720
If we can all raise it up.

00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:03.790
So this is an A frame tarp.

00:43:03.790 --> 00:43:08.869
It only weighs about 9 ounces.

00:43:08.869 --> 00:43:11.570
The great thing about this shelter, in addition
be being really light, you have a tremendous

00:43:11.570 --> 00:43:14.960
amount of coverage area for one person, and
also, great ventilation.

00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:18.250
You won't have very many condensation problems
with this shelter.

00:43:18.250 --> 00:43:20.320
Unfortunately, there's no protection against
the ground.

00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:21.780
There's no protection against bugs.

00:43:21.780 --> 00:43:27.180
And it has two open ends, even if you pitch
it down to the ground.

00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:30.200
If you do want to use a shelter like this,
you need to know where to camp.

00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:32.960
I usually try to pitch it right up against
a big bush.

00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:39.920
I try to camp away from the bugs, and in a
more protected area where there's not going

00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:41.550
to be a whole lot of wind.

00:43:41.550 --> 00:43:44.309
Then what I'll-- Okay, that's probably fine.

00:43:44.309 --> 00:43:46.440
I think that'll be good.

00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:49.750
But hang up here one more-- I have one more
shelter to show.

00:43:49.750 --> 00:43:51.589
You can let go of this one.

00:43:51.589 --> 00:43:56.349
[rustling sounds]
Normally, what I'll do when I use an A frame

00:43:56.349 --> 00:43:59.700
tarp is I'll take a water resistant biddy
sack like this one here.

00:43:59.700 --> 00:44:04.230
This bivy sack has a waterproof floor, and
then a very breathable nylon top.

00:44:04.230 --> 00:44:06.520
This gives me protection against the ground.

00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:11.089
It provides bug protection, and also provides
a little bit of extra warmth, like 5 degrees.

00:44:11.089 --> 00:44:14.730
But a bivy sack like this is really helpful
with that quilt, because the quilt can be

00:44:14.730 --> 00:44:18.440
a little bit drafty.

00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:25.850
The combination of these two systems is what
I describe as the modular tarp system, because

00:44:25.850 --> 00:44:26.940
it's designed to work together.

00:44:26.940 --> 00:44:29.329
All right, one more shelter to show.

00:44:29.329 --> 00:44:31.790
This is another shelter that I might use.

00:44:31.790 --> 00:44:35.780
[rustling sounds] It's definitely a more robust
shelter.

00:44:35.780 --> 00:44:38.410
I need a center pole.

00:44:38.410 --> 00:44:42.089
Can someone jump underneath?

00:44:42.089 --> 00:44:43.089
[pause] All right.

00:44:43.089 --> 00:44:44.520
Hold this end here.

00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:45.670
All right.

00:44:45.670 --> 00:44:46.670
Okay.

00:44:46.670 --> 00:44:48.140
This is a 13 ounce shelter.

00:44:48.140 --> 00:44:50.550
This is actually the shelter that I used with
me up in Alaska.

00:44:50.550 --> 00:44:58.670
When I started this trip in March-- okay,
thanks guys-- I was 30 miles north of the

00:44:58.670 --> 00:44:59.670
Arctic Circle.

00:44:59.670 --> 00:45:02.030
I had a 13 ounce tarp with me.

00:45:02.030 --> 00:45:06.980
Then I used the shelter for the remainder
of the trip, and the only time I needed to

00:45:06.980 --> 00:45:09.790
change it up a little bit was when the bugs
came out.

00:45:09.790 --> 00:45:14.500
Then, at that time, I added a bug nest like
this one here that fits right underneath the

00:45:14.500 --> 00:45:16.190
shelter.

00:45:16.190 --> 00:45:22.319
That shelter provided a complete protection,
really robust, 360 degrees.

00:45:22.319 --> 00:45:24.920
The whole system only weighed about 22 ounces.

00:45:24.920 --> 00:45:27.099
[pause] I think I'm going to skip it.

00:45:27.099 --> 00:45:29.880
Any questions on shelters?

00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:30.880
Yes.

00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:38.210
&gt;&gt;male #35: Does more insulation at night
help if you're exhausted?

00:45:38.210 --> 00:45:42.540
&gt;&gt;Skurka: More insulation at night would definitely
help if you're exhausted and can't produce

00:45:42.540 --> 00:45:43.970
your own body heat.

00:45:43.970 --> 00:45:47.930
I'd say that the best way to keep yourself
insulated, though, is a heavier weight sleeping

00:45:47.930 --> 00:45:49.589
bag as opposed to a shelter.

00:45:49.589 --> 00:45:53.540
A lot of people look at a tarp and they're
like, "Wow, it looks so chilly."

00:45:53.540 --> 00:46:02.609
Which, true, it is, but in order to-- The
better way to look at it is let's say I need

00:46:02.609 --> 00:46:04.800
an extra 10 degrees of warmth.

00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:11.079
You can get an extra 10 degrees of warmth
in a sleeping bag by adding, say, 3 or 4 ounces

00:46:11.079 --> 00:46:15.460
of insulation, whereas to get 10 degrees of
warmth in a shelter, you need to add probably

00:46:15.460 --> 00:46:17.750
3, 4 pounds of material.

00:46:17.750 --> 00:46:23.480
So it's much better to go with a lighter weight
shelter that is more functional to protect

00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:26.119
you against the wind and rain and bugs.

00:46:26.119 --> 00:46:33.150
And then use your sleeping bag and your clothing
system to keep you warm at night.

00:46:33.150 --> 00:46:40.757
&gt;&gt;female #5: Why would someone want to buy
one of the more tent-like things?

00:46:40.757 --> 00:46:43.630
&gt;&gt;Skurka: Why would someone want to take a
double-- a traditional tent with them?

00:46:43.630 --> 00:46:46.660
I think that's a wonderful question to ask.

00:46:46.660 --> 00:46:48.280
[laughter] I don't know.

00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:52.020
I think most people walk in and they see it's
all set up and it's so easy.

00:46:52.020 --> 00:46:56.250
You just slide a pole in that sleeve, then
slide a pole in that sleeve, and pop, there

00:46:56.250 --> 00:46:57.250
it goes.

00:46:57.250 --> 00:47:01.640
You don't need to think about where to set
it up or how to tie out some of the guidelines.

00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:03.599
You don't need to think about any of that
stuff.

00:47:03.599 --> 00:47:04.829
But there's a cost to that.

00:47:04.829 --> 00:47:09.820
It's a piece of foolproof gear, but unfortunately,
it weights 3, 4 times as much as a system

00:47:09.820 --> 00:47:11.030
like this does.

00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:13.180
&gt;&gt;female #5: [inaudible]

00:47:13.180 --> 00:47:16.040
&gt;&gt;Skurka: No, not really.

00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:17.430
It just doesn't have two poles.

00:47:17.430 --> 00:47:20.900
You have to use your trekking poles.

00:47:20.900 --> 00:47:24.700
With a tarp, you have to use-- I mean, you
have these guidelines, but there's a really

00:47:24.700 --> 00:47:28.540
simple way to do the guideline system.

00:47:28.540 --> 00:47:30.880
Could I just have an arm?

00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:33.040
[laughter] Okay, just hold that.

00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:36.460
With the guideline system-- Let it slide a
little bit.

00:47:36.460 --> 00:47:41.350
I just have a bowline knot here, and then
I use this trucker's hitch system.

00:47:41.350 --> 00:47:43.160
Now I've got a 2 to 1 pulley.

00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:47.220
And then to tie this thing off, I just use
a slippery half hitch.

00:47:47.220 --> 00:47:48.220
That's that system.

00:47:48.220 --> 00:47:49.220
I did it instantly.

00:47:49.220 --> 00:47:52.880
So it's really fast and easy, but it's a little
bit of a skill.

00:47:52.880 --> 00:47:57.751
People, a lot of backpackers, for some reason
don't want to learn the skills that allow

00:47:57.751 --> 00:48:00.980
them to take pieces of gear like this.

00:48:00.980 --> 00:48:05.690
Let's keep moving through here: maps and navigation.

00:48:05.690 --> 00:48:09.109
I highly recommend learning how to use a map
and a compass.

00:48:09.109 --> 00:48:12.390
With a map and a compass, I can do everything
that a GPS can do.

00:48:12.390 --> 00:48:17.230
I can pinpoint my exact location, at least
to a relevant degree of accuracy, maybe not

00:48:17.230 --> 00:48:19.049
within 3 meters.

00:48:19.049 --> 00:48:24.359
But in a backpacking application, that sort
of accuracy doesn't matter.

00:48:24.359 --> 00:48:30.920
Also, by tracking my progress, I can figure
out how fast I'm going and where I'm going.

00:48:30.920 --> 00:48:34.710
But maybe the more important thing with map
and compass is that there's some big advantages.

00:48:34.710 --> 00:48:38.780
It's more reliable because it's not electronic,
it doesn't rely on batteries.

00:48:38.780 --> 00:48:40.790
It's also a lighter weight system.

00:48:40.790 --> 00:48:47.860
And then, with a map-- The maps that I print
out are on-- This is an 8.5 X 11, but the

00:48:47.860 --> 00:48:50.869
maps that I print out are normally 11 X 14
inches.

00:48:50.869 --> 00:48:56.910
That amount of map provides me way more information
than a GPS with a high resolution screen that's

00:48:56.910 --> 00:48:57.910
this big.

00:48:57.910 --> 00:49:00.160
What do you want to be looking at if you're
traveling across a landscape?

00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:03.210
You want to be looking at a hard piece of
paper.

00:49:03.210 --> 00:49:08.150
And then, finally, the big thing with map
and compass is that a GPS can only tell you--

00:49:08.150 --> 00:49:11.210
If you're at point A and you want to get to
point B, it'll tell you the distance and it'll

00:49:11.210 --> 00:49:13.520
tell you the direction, but it won't tell
you how to get there.

00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:18.580
It might have you swim across the deepest
part of the river, and you might have to go

00:49:18.580 --> 00:49:21.550
in and out of a canyon, and it might take
you through the thickest brush.

00:49:21.550 --> 00:49:26.290
Whereas if you understand, when you look at
a map, what all of that means, you can pick

00:49:26.290 --> 00:49:30.030
a path of least resistance.

00:49:30.030 --> 00:49:32.800
So we asked a question earlier about trekking
poles.

00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:36.420
I always take trekking poles with me, especially
on backpacking trips.

00:49:36.420 --> 00:49:39.720
They help propel me forward, they help propel
me upward.

00:49:39.720 --> 00:49:45.920
And then, on the descent, they help to take
it easy on my knees a little bit, because

00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:49.640
you're always doing those one-legged squats
down, especially on steeper terrain.

00:49:49.640 --> 00:49:51.500
So the trekking poles are really helpful.

00:49:51.500 --> 00:49:53.640
I also use them to set up my shelter at night.

00:49:53.640 --> 00:49:58.180
I've used them even to fend off grizzly bears.

00:49:58.180 --> 00:50:02.270
[laughter] No joke.

00:50:02.270 --> 00:50:03.280
I should get the video.

00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:09.130
You guys can go to another slideshow sometime
about my-- On my Alaska trip, I was up in

00:50:09.130 --> 00:50:11.060
the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.

00:50:11.060 --> 00:50:15.020
I'm hiking along, at it's midnight but there's
still plenty of daylight.

00:50:15.020 --> 00:50:18.200
I go on up this valley and I just have this
moment where I'm like, "Wow, you should really

00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:21.430
just turn around and see if you can see a
bear grazing on the hillside."

00:50:21.430 --> 00:50:26.120
So I look up, and I look this way, and I see
a grizzly bear charging at me out of the brush.

00:50:26.120 --> 00:50:29.190
[laughter] I squared up to it, yelled at it.

00:50:29.190 --> 00:50:33.069
It paused and then realized that I probably
shouldn't be messed with.

00:50:33.069 --> 00:50:34.750
Then it ran away.

00:50:34.750 --> 00:50:40.910
Half an hour later, I have that same sense,
so I-- [laughter] I turn this way and there's

00:50:40.910 --> 00:50:45.660
a grizzly bear charging at me across these
gravel braids where there's a creek.

00:50:45.660 --> 00:50:46.809
I was a little bit above it.

00:50:46.809 --> 00:50:50.740
I was probably 10 feet above it on the bank.

00:50:50.740 --> 00:50:52.910
The grizzly bear was so close by the time
I saw it, it was like at that pole.

00:50:52.910 --> 00:50:57.119
So I took my trekking pole, and I threw--
I was walking like this and I threw my trekking

00:50:57.119 --> 00:51:02.309
pole across my body because I didn't have
time to square up and throw it.

00:51:02.309 --> 00:51:03.790
It landed right in front of the bear.

00:51:03.790 --> 00:51:05.390
I was also yelling at the bear.

00:51:05.390 --> 00:51:11.109
Between me throwing projectiles at it and
yelling at it, it made a 90 degree turn.

00:51:11.109 --> 00:51:13.810
As it was running away, it crapped itself.

00:51:13.810 --> 00:51:23.400
[laughter] Then there was this 30 foot long
streak of red berry crap along the gravel

00:51:23.400 --> 00:51:24.400
braids.

00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:27.020
It was a great video, which I like.

00:51:27.020 --> 00:51:28.780
I'm retelling this story.

00:51:28.780 --> 00:51:31.650
Halfway through the video, it just dawns on
me that I've scared the crap out of a grizzly

00:51:31.650 --> 00:51:32.920
bear.

00:51:32.920 --> 00:51:37.720
[laughter] You look at it and you're like,
"Wow, that guy has been out there for a while."

00:51:37.720 --> 00:51:40.609
[laughter]
All right.

00:51:40.609 --> 00:51:43.500
Food and nutrition.

00:51:43.500 --> 00:51:47.680
As far as food, one ounce of carbohydrates
or protein has 100 calories.

00:51:47.680 --> 00:51:50.460
One ounce of fat has 240 calories.

00:51:50.460 --> 00:51:56.540
If you wanted to go with two extreme types
of diets-- Every day, you need about 3000

00:51:56.540 --> 00:51:58.210
calories if you're going to be backpacking.

00:51:58.210 --> 00:52:04.040
If you only want to take protein or carbohydrates,
you could carry 30 ounces of gummy bears.

00:52:04.040 --> 00:52:08.660
Alternatively, you could carry 12 1/2 ounces
of butter.

00:52:08.660 --> 00:52:15.809
[laughter] The better thing to do is find
some balance of fat versus protein and carbohydrate.

00:52:15.809 --> 00:52:20.990
Usually, for most people, it's in the range
of 125 to 150 calories an ounce.

00:52:20.990 --> 00:52:25.040
If you're going to be on a really long distance
trip, you probably will need a little bit

00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:26.040
more.

00:52:26.040 --> 00:52:30.359
If you're just out there for the weekend and
you're a petite male or female or, say, a

00:52:30.359 --> 00:52:32.369
teenager, you probably will need a little
bit less.

00:52:32.369 --> 00:52:39.339
But that 3000 calorie per day is a pretty
good starting point for most people.

00:52:39.339 --> 00:52:42.730
[pause]
All right.

00:52:42.730 --> 00:52:53.140
As far as food types, I've never, ever, ever
taken enough chocolate on a backpacking trip.

00:52:53.140 --> 00:52:58.960
[laughter] During the day, I'd say 2/3 of
the things that I eat have some sort of chocolate

00:52:58.960 --> 00:52:59.960
in them.

00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:07.190
It's chocolate-covered raisins, it's chocolate
bars, it's an energy bar with chocolate in

00:53:07.190 --> 00:53:08.190
it.

00:53:08.190 --> 00:53:10.740
Not like the fake soy chocolate, but like
chocolate chocolate.

00:53:10.740 --> 00:53:15.950
I've just found-- I have the incinerator theory,
where basically, if I put nutrients into my

00:53:15.950 --> 00:53:17.589
body, my body will burn them.

00:53:17.589 --> 00:53:19.359
So I just feed my body what it wants.

00:53:19.359 --> 00:53:21.570
And typically, it always wants chocolate.

00:53:21.570 --> 00:53:25.960
[laughter] Then, for dinners, I make a hot
meal at night.

00:53:25.960 --> 00:53:31.890
I just-- The typical routine is that I boil
water, throw in something that cooks really

00:53:31.890 --> 00:53:41.319
fast, like potatoes, beans, rice, couscous,
ramen, and then I add butter, oils, cheese,

00:53:41.319 --> 00:53:42.319
and spices.

00:53:42.319 --> 00:53:47.849
Basically every night looks like glop in a
bowl, but at the end of a really long day,

00:53:47.849 --> 00:53:51.850
it still tastes really good.

00:53:51.850 --> 00:53:55.120
I would also point out it's probably possible
if you're going up to the Sierra just for

00:53:55.120 --> 00:54:00.160
a short trip, you might want to just run over
to the cafeteria and pick up yourself a couple

00:54:00.160 --> 00:54:01.160
of dinners.

00:54:01.160 --> 00:54:02.160
You can just pack them.

00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:06.069
Because it won't be that much weight, and
it probably would look a lot better than glop

00:54:06.069 --> 00:54:08.130
in a bowl.

00:54:08.130 --> 00:54:09.781
&gt;&gt;female #6: Do you ever bring meat?

00:54:09.781 --> 00:54:13.280
&gt;&gt;Skurka: I do bring meat with me, but it's
always not like uncooked meat.

00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:18.260
It's beef jerky, salami, that sort of thing.

00:54:18.260 --> 00:54:20.230
I usually eat it during the day.

00:54:20.230 --> 00:54:24.620
Sometimes-- Actually, this meal, this is one
of the best meals I ever made.

00:54:24.620 --> 00:54:26.250
This one here.

00:54:26.250 --> 00:54:33.380
It was cheese-filled linguine with some sort
of fancy sausage and pesto sauce and olive

00:54:33.380 --> 00:54:34.380
oil.

00:54:34.380 --> 00:54:36.260
What that doesn't sound awesome?

00:54:36.260 --> 00:54:39.630
Come on! [laughter] Trust me, it was.

00:54:39.630 --> 00:54:40.630
[clears throat]

00:54:40.630 --> 00:54:43.470
&gt;&gt;male #36: We're spoiled a little.

00:54:43.470 --> 00:54:45.789
&gt;&gt;Skurka: You guys are spoiled at Google.

00:54:45.789 --> 00:54:46.789
All right.

00:54:46.789 --> 00:54:52.400
[exhales loudly] It's okay if I start a fire
in here, right?

00:54:52.400 --> 00:54:58.640
[laughter] I'm going to just clear some room.

00:54:58.640 --> 00:55:01.770
[scraping sounds] All right.

00:55:01.770 --> 00:55:07.559
The first-- The stove that I recommend, I
actually made out of a Fancy Feast cat food

00:55:07.559 --> 00:55:08.660
can.

00:55:08.660 --> 00:55:09.660
This is it.

00:55:09.660 --> 00:55:13.100
Actually, this was the stove I used on my
Alaska trip.

00:55:13.100 --> 00:55:14.549
It weighs 3/10 of an ounce.

00:55:14.549 --> 00:55:15.549
It will never break.

00:55:15.549 --> 00:55:16.549
It will never clog up.

00:55:16.549 --> 00:55:20.730
It only cost me $1.50, including the hole
punch I had to by in order to make it.

00:55:20.730 --> 00:55:24.400
It burns denatured alcohol, which you can
get in the paint department at the hardware

00:55:24.400 --> 00:55:25.400
store.

00:55:25.400 --> 00:55:31.109
Then I made a wind screen from Reynolds wrap.
[scraping sounds] It just folds up nicely

00:55:31.109 --> 00:55:34.420
in the bottom of my pot.

00:55:34.420 --> 00:55:37.980
The alcohol you can just keep in a water bottle
like this one here.

00:55:37.980 --> 00:55:46.640
I generally need about 3/4 of an ounce of
alcohol per meal for about a cup and 1/2,

00:55:46.640 --> 00:55:48.780
2 cups of water.

00:55:48.780 --> 00:55:55.619
I like the start the stove with matches because
a lighter, you have to get your finger down

00:55:55.619 --> 00:55:59.589
in there, and it's a good way to burn your
hand night after night.

00:55:59.589 --> 00:56:05.119
It takes about 7 to 8 minutes for the stove
to boil water.

00:56:05.119 --> 00:56:09.920
But basically-- I don't have any water in
here, but if I had water, I would just put

00:56:09.920 --> 00:56:17.520
a pot right on top, and then I would cover
the whole thing with the wind screen, let

00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:21.599
it sit there for 8 minutes or so to come to
a boil, then I'd add my meal.

00:56:21.599 --> 00:56:26.390
The only problem with this stove: you can't
put it out, which is why I didn't put very

00:56:26.390 --> 00:56:28.550
much alcohol in it.

00:56:28.550 --> 00:56:31.060
You can also see that the flame's not very
bright.

00:56:31.060 --> 00:56:34.049
So if you're going to use this in the daytime,
just be careful.

00:56:34.049 --> 00:56:37.569
When you start it, you'll hear a pop when
it lights up.

00:56:37.569 --> 00:56:40.280
Then, if you put your hand over it, you'll
feel the heat.

00:56:40.280 --> 00:56:45.500
But just make sure that you don't-- I have
had a friend who started her stove, lit it

00:56:45.500 --> 00:56:49.579
up, and was like, "Oh, it hasn't started yet",
then took her fuel bottle like this.

00:56:49.579 --> 00:56:54.140
[laughter] [mimics squirting noise] It's not
a very explosive fuel, but you don't want

00:56:54.140 --> 00:56:59.119
to-- it'd be easy enough to start a fire with
it.

00:56:59.119 --> 00:57:02.720
The first time I ever gave one of these lightweight
clinics, I was in Boulder at the Eastern Mountain

00:57:02.720 --> 00:57:04.140
Sports store.

00:57:04.140 --> 00:57:06.039
I started this stove.

00:57:06.039 --> 00:57:07.339
It's a neat thing.

00:57:07.339 --> 00:57:08.799
It's homemade, it costs you $1.50.

00:57:08.799 --> 00:57:11.530
I put the pot on top and I didn't have any
water in it.

00:57:11.530 --> 00:57:14.300
The pot got pretty hot just sitting there.

00:57:14.300 --> 00:57:18.440
After 30 seconds of just saying how cool the
stove was, I took the pot and I put it down

00:57:18.440 --> 00:57:24.890
on the carpet, [clanging noise] like that,
and I hear [makes hissing noise] [laughter]

00:57:24.890 --> 00:57:27.970
It's this black smoke coming from the edges
of the pot.

00:57:27.970 --> 00:57:31.520
I give the pot a tug and it won't move.

00:57:31.520 --> 00:57:34.190
So I really tug it hard, and I pull it up.

00:57:34.190 --> 00:57:39.940
There's a bunch of carpet on the bottom of
the pot, and this black burn mark on the carpet.

00:57:39.940 --> 00:57:42.460
I look up at the store manager, and I'm like,
"Eee, sorry!"

00:57:42.460 --> 00:57:44.630
He's like, "Oh, no big deal, no big deal."

00:57:44.630 --> 00:57:48.150
After the presentation, I'm like, "I'm really
sorry about your carpet.

00:57:48.150 --> 00:57:50.869
I'd be happy to replace it for you, whatever
you need."

00:57:50.869 --> 00:57:53.920
And he's like, "Dude, it's really no big deal"
and he just grabs a rolling rack and puts

00:57:53.920 --> 00:57:55.049
it right over the burn mark.

00:57:55.049 --> 00:57:56.049
[laughter]
All right.

00:57:56.049 --> 00:57:57.049
All right.

00:57:57.049 --> 00:57:58.049
Water purification.

00:57:58.049 --> 00:58:07.000
&gt;&gt;male #37: I was wondering if you had an
extra box for the [inaudible]

00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:08.000
&gt;&gt;Skurka: Yes.

00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:09.000
&gt;&gt;male #37: That uses alcohol.

00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:13.890
Just like that red adhesive tape around it
so you know it's not water.

00:58:13.890 --> 00:58:14.890
&gt;&gt;Skurka: Oh, right.

00:58:14.890 --> 00:58:17.920
The gentlemen suggested if you're going to
bring alcohol with you, somehow mark the water

00:58:17.920 --> 00:58:18.920
bottle.

00:58:18.920 --> 00:58:20.780
That way, you don't try to drink it.

00:58:20.780 --> 00:58:25.049
I generally don't have that problem because
I use these soft sided platypus bottles like

00:58:25.049 --> 00:58:26.310
this one.

00:58:26.310 --> 00:58:28.150
These platypus bottles are great.

00:58:28.150 --> 00:58:31.990
They weigh 1/6 the weight of an Algium bottle
for the same amount of volume.

00:58:31.990 --> 00:58:35.970
They're collapsible, so they don't take up
any room in my pack if I'm not using them.

00:58:35.970 --> 00:58:39.590
At night, they're soft, so I blow them up
with air or water and I throw them in a stuffed

00:58:39.590 --> 00:58:41.369
sack, and I can use them as a pillow.

00:58:41.369 --> 00:58:42.500
Pretty slick.

00:58:42.500 --> 00:58:49.060
Then, for water treatment, I use these Aquamira
drops.

00:58:49.060 --> 00:58:54.120
This is enough for 30 gallons of water, so
I usually put these in separate smaller dropper

00:58:54.120 --> 00:58:58.079
bottles so I don't have to carry the whole
thing out with me.

00:58:58.079 --> 00:59:05.130
You take the mixing cap right here, 5 drops
of A, 5 drops of B-- I'm sorry, 7 drops of

00:59:05.130 --> 00:59:08.869
A, 7 drops of B. Let it react for 5 minutes,
put it in 1 liter of water.

00:59:08.869 --> 00:59:12.480
Within 15 minutes you have purified water.

00:59:12.480 --> 00:59:16.810
I was just told, this week, that Aquamira
is now approved as a water purifier if you're

00:59:16.810 --> 00:59:21.549
in the state of California, so you'd be able
to find it at REI, among other retail stores,

00:59:21.549 --> 00:59:23.340
in the water purification section.

00:59:23.340 --> 00:59:24.340
Yes.

00:59:24.340 --> 00:59:26.410
&gt;&gt;male #38: How would you-- Thoughts on [inaudible]

00:59:26.410 --> 00:59:27.410
&gt;&gt;Skurka: Right.

00:59:27.410 --> 00:59:31.960
Another good option, especially if you're
with a group, is to use these UV lights.

00:59:31.960 --> 00:59:34.200
It doesn't rely on chemicals.

00:59:34.200 --> 00:59:35.330
It's also really fast.

00:59:35.330 --> 00:59:37.520
It's like 45 seconds.

00:59:37.520 --> 00:59:42.300
That's a great option if you're with a group
or you're doing a lot of purifying and you

00:59:42.300 --> 00:59:44.060
just want to do it fast.

00:59:44.060 --> 00:59:47.200
The problem with the lights is that you can't
get them into these platypus bottles.

00:59:47.200 --> 00:59:48.780
You need a wider mouth.

00:59:48.780 --> 00:59:56.390
And it's also subject to failure, so you don't--
you still have to carry something as a backup,

00:59:56.390 --> 01:00:01.359
because you might, if the batteries run out
or if it malfunctions for some reason, you'll

01:00:01.359 --> 01:00:02.910
need something else.

01:00:02.910 --> 01:00:04.470
&gt;&gt;male #38: [inaudible]

01:00:04.470 --> 01:00:09.690
&gt;&gt;Skurka: Like I said, there's some-- you
definitely need a backup, because they are

01:00:09.690 --> 01:00:12.329
prone to failure.

01:00:12.329 --> 01:00:13.520
Okay.

01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:14.520
Small essentials.

01:00:14.520 --> 01:00:19.780
I'm not going to go through all of this, but
I have my foot care kit and my first aid items

01:00:19.780 --> 01:00:21.900
up here, if you want to take a look.

01:00:21.900 --> 01:00:24.829
Inevitably, you need a bunch of these tiny
items.

01:00:24.829 --> 01:00:27.089
Try to keep them to a minimum.

01:00:27.089 --> 01:00:32.700
Then, as far as first aid, there are four
principles that I use.

01:00:32.700 --> 01:00:39.280
The first is that every first aid item I take
with me can't be improvised in the field.

01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:44.010
I take with me, especially on group trips,
I take with me some latex gloves, because

01:00:44.010 --> 01:00:46.140
I can't improvise these in the field.

01:00:46.140 --> 01:00:50.170
I also take things that are multi-functional.

01:00:50.170 --> 01:00:57.290
Instead of taking [rustling noise] those square
pieces of gauze, I take roll gauze, because

01:00:57.290 --> 01:01:02.050
I can make square pieces of gauze out of roll
gauze, but I can't do the opposite.

01:01:02.050 --> 01:01:04.839
Square gauze, a little bit more versatile.

01:01:04.839 --> 01:01:09.290
Also, every first aid item is relevant to
the trip and the environment.

01:01:09.290 --> 01:01:13.210
I'm not going to carry altitude drugs for
a hike in the Appalachian Mountains.

01:01:13.210 --> 01:01:16.020
I'm not going to carry a snakebite kit for
the Arctic.

01:01:16.020 --> 01:01:18.000
It's just not going to happen.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:21.609
Then, finally, I have to know how to use it.

01:01:21.609 --> 01:01:25.920
You'll see a lot-- A lot of the campers, by
default, you'll look at their first aid kit,

01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:29.250
and they will have things in there that they
have no idea how to use.

01:01:29.250 --> 01:01:34.640
They'll have a, not a respirator, a CPR mask.

01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:36.869
And you'll say, "Do you know how to give CPR?"

01:01:36.869 --> 01:01:42.799
And they're all like, "No, but maybe someone
else around will know how to give CPR."

01:01:42.799 --> 01:01:45.109
Just don't-- If you don't know how to use
it, just don't take it.

01:01:45.109 --> 01:01:48.289
It's the same reason I don't take a suture
kit.

01:01:48.289 --> 01:01:52.410
I don't know how to give sutures, so I'm not
going to take needle and thread for that.

01:01:52.410 --> 01:01:56.349
Generally, there are two types of first aid
scenarios.

01:01:56.349 --> 01:01:59.430
One scenario is that I can treat it in the
field.

01:01:59.430 --> 01:02:04.240
That's like small cuts, burns, scrapes, maybe
some minor infections.

01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:07.690
I can do all that in the field, and I have
the equipment to take care of that.

01:02:07.690 --> 01:02:12.770
But for those bigger medical emergencies,
like, say someone-- This is always far-fetched,

01:02:12.770 --> 01:02:16.930
I hate using a scenario like someone breaks
their femur while backpacking.

01:02:16.930 --> 01:02:18.550
It'd be really hard to do.

01:02:18.550 --> 01:02:19.930
You'd have to do something really dumb.

01:02:19.930 --> 01:02:22.030
But let's suppose someone does.

01:02:22.030 --> 01:02:26.100
There's nothing that I can carry with me out
there that is going to help someone with a

01:02:26.100 --> 01:02:27.940
broken femur.

01:02:27.940 --> 01:02:33.160
My job at that point is to stabilize them,
to get them as comfortable as possible, and

01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:34.160
then to get help.

01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:35.160
I need to get them out.

01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:41.299
In that case, I usually take with me some
sort of satellite communications device.

01:02:41.299 --> 01:02:45.910
What I've been using recently is one of these
Spot communicators, or Spot connects.

01:02:45.910 --> 01:02:52.500
It hooks together with my phone via Bluetooth.

01:02:52.500 --> 01:02:53.589
I can call for help.

01:02:53.589 --> 01:02:54.589
I can call for help.

01:02:54.589 --> 01:02:58.349
I can also call 911, which goes to all search
and rescue teams.

01:02:58.349 --> 01:03:03.450
I can also send "Okay" messages, just the
let the folks back home-- "Hey, I'm camped

01:03:03.450 --> 01:03:04.820
here tonight.

01:03:04.820 --> 01:03:06.359
Everything is good.

01:03:06.359 --> 01:03:08.170
Don't worry about me."

01:03:08.170 --> 01:03:11.480
Then, with the Spot connect, I can actually
send out messages.

01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:15.260
This was a 4 day trip I did up in Alaska last
summer.

01:03:15.260 --> 01:03:18.950
The last message that I-- When I arrived at
the trailhead I said, "Out.

01:03:18.950 --> 01:03:20.109
Safe and happy.

01:03:20.109 --> 01:03:21.950
Excited about dinner."

01:03:21.950 --> 01:03:25.780
My mom, she gets the message, and within 5
minutes I have a phone call from her saying,

01:03:25.780 --> 01:03:27.619
"Hey, really glad that you're out.

01:03:27.619 --> 01:03:29.059
Have a great dinner.

01:03:29.059 --> 01:03:31.940
Talk to you later."

01:03:31.940 --> 01:03:38.829
I can't remember the Spot slogan, but it's
something about "rescue when you need it and

01:03:38.829 --> 01:03:40.660
for all the other times, peace of mind."

01:03:40.660 --> 01:03:45.160
It's a pretty inexpensive investment, pretty
lightweight, and it works pretty well.

01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:46.160
Yes.

01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:47.160
Hold on one second.

01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:48.160
We have two questions.

01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:49.160
Yes.

01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:50.160
&gt;&gt;male #39: Do you have to worry about batteries
running out?

01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:53.150
Do you have anything to charge them?

01:03:53.150 --> 01:03:55.720
&gt;&gt;Skurka: The batteries last a really long
time.

01:03:55.720 --> 01:04:01.390
With the newer units, there's also an indicator
about battery life.

01:04:01.390 --> 01:04:05.539
The first generation-- This was the second
generation unit, but the first generation

01:04:05.539 --> 01:04:10.130
unit I had, I think I used it for 2 to 3 years
and never had to replace the batteries.

01:04:10.130 --> 01:04:11.430
So I wouldn't be too worried.

01:04:11.430 --> 01:04:14.349
&gt;&gt;male #39: If you're using your cell phone
with it--

01:04:14.349 --> 01:04:18.210
&gt;&gt;Skurka: That's a-- Yeah, it's-- I was doing,
last summer, I was guiding a bunch of one

01:04:18.210 --> 01:04:21.760
week trips, and my cell phone had no problem
for a week.

01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:24.089
In that case, just bring an extra battery,
too.

01:04:24.089 --> 01:04:25.359
That's not necessarily a bad idea.

01:04:25.359 --> 01:04:28.780
It weighs 1/2 and ounce, maybe an ounce.

01:04:28.780 --> 01:04:29.780
Easy thing to do.

01:04:29.780 --> 01:04:30.780
Yes.

01:04:30.780 --> 01:04:31.780
&gt;&gt;male #40: [inaudible]

01:04:31.780 --> 01:04:37.369
&gt;&gt;Skurka: The Spot works worldwide, but it's
mostly only on landmasses.

01:04:37.369 --> 01:04:41.529
If you're going to be sailing across the Pacific,
this isn't the system for you.

01:04:41.529 --> 01:04:46.650
But it'll work pretty much anywhere on the
world's landmasses.

01:04:46.650 --> 01:04:47.660
Okay.

01:04:47.660 --> 01:04:52.500
Maybe, I think, last subject is backpacks.

01:04:52.500 --> 01:04:57.109
There are a couple of considerations with
backpacks.

01:04:57.109 --> 01:05:01.599
The first one is that backpacks-- Let me rephrase
that.

01:05:01.599 --> 01:05:02.770
Backpacks have to serve two functions.

01:05:02.770 --> 01:05:07.849
They have to carry all my stuff, they have
to fit it all, and also to support it all.

01:05:07.849 --> 01:05:10.400
I pick a backpack at the very last minute.

01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:13.260
It's like, "Okay, here's all the stuff that
I need to bring with me.

01:05:13.260 --> 01:05:14.640
Here's how much it weighs.

01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:16.660
Therefore, this is the backpack that I need."

01:05:16.660 --> 01:05:20.250
You don't want to work the other direction,
because you'll end up getting a backpack that's

01:05:20.250 --> 01:05:23.829
either too big, or it won't support the load,
or it's just too excessive for what you're

01:05:23.829 --> 01:05:26.849
using it for.

01:05:26.849 --> 01:05:33.539
There are generally two types of backpacks
that we use nowadays.

01:05:33.539 --> 01:05:35.020
Ignore this.

01:05:35.020 --> 01:05:39.230
This is a little bit of a funky backpack,
but it works.

01:05:39.230 --> 01:05:44.099
This backpack here is called a suspension
backpack, or a framed backpack.

01:05:44.099 --> 01:05:48.260
It's given a rigid suspension system with
these aluminum stays in here.

01:05:48.260 --> 01:05:49.260
There are two of them.

01:05:49.260 --> 01:05:53.339
But you also might have a backpack that has
a frame sheet, which would be like a plastic

01:05:53.339 --> 01:05:54.339
sheet inside of here.

01:05:54.339 --> 01:05:56.680
There are also ones that have these peripheral
rods.

01:05:56.680 --> 01:06:01.619
It would be this metal rod around the perimeter
of the backpack.

01:06:01.619 --> 01:06:05.760
The whole point of that suspension system
is to transfer weight from your shoulders

01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:06.760
to your hips.

01:06:06.760 --> 01:06:10.460
If I put this backpack on and I take all the
weight off of my shoulders, this backpack

01:06:10.460 --> 01:06:13.020
still sits right on my hips.

01:06:13.020 --> 01:06:16.960
If I'm carrying a heavy load, I want it on
my hips because my hips are supported by my

01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:18.740
glutes and by my ab muscles.

01:06:18.740 --> 01:06:20.950
In comparison, my shoulders are really puny.

01:06:20.950 --> 01:06:26.619
I don't want to-- having to support a lot
of weight with my shoulders.

01:06:26.619 --> 01:06:29.410
The other type of backpack is a frameless
backpack like this one here.

01:06:29.410 --> 01:06:32.750
It doesn't have anything rigid in it at all.

01:06:32.750 --> 01:06:39.500
If I try to do that same exact thing, the
backpack will just fall over.

01:06:39.500 --> 01:06:44.690
Now, it doesn't-- Not all of the weight gets
supported by my shoulders, but I'd say probably

01:06:44.690 --> 01:06:47.570
3/4 of it will get supported by my shoulders.

01:06:47.570 --> 01:06:52.079
But my shoulders are strong enough to support
25, 30 pounds.

01:06:52.079 --> 01:06:58.280
But as soon as I go over that threshold, I
want something with a more rigid system.

01:06:58.280 --> 01:07:06.599
Then, to waterproof my backpack, I just take
a plastic trash compacter bag.

01:07:06.599 --> 01:07:08.400
You can buy a whole bundle of these.

01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:15.039
I think this was years ago, I bought a 50
roll for 15 bucks at Walmart.

01:07:15.039 --> 01:07:16.980
They last about a month.

01:07:16.980 --> 01:07:18.329
They're very waterproof.

01:07:18.329 --> 01:07:28.930
I just put it on the-- [pause] I'll take my
sleeping pad [swishing and rustling noises]

01:07:28.930 --> 01:07:33.460
and by putting the sleeping pad in here and
then putting this inside the backpack, it

01:07:33.460 --> 01:07:43.720
gives my-- [rustling noises] it gives what
is otherwise an unrigid backpack some structure

01:07:43.720 --> 01:07:44.720
and some shape.

01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:50.460
It also protects my back against anything
that might be hard on the inside of the pack.

01:07:50.460 --> 01:07:55.760
National Geographic did a beautiful 16 page
spread on my Alaska-Yukon expedition.

01:07:55.760 --> 01:07:56.910
There were signed copies available.

01:07:56.910 --> 01:07:58.400
Are there any more left?

01:07:58.400 --> 01:07:59.400
No.

01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:01.349
Okay, that's fine.

01:08:01.349 --> 01:08:05.140
You can all, if you'd like, you can grab--
I still have some for sale on my website.

01:08:05.140 --> 01:08:09.809
Then, finally-- Here, let me give you that,
I'll pay for it.

01:08:09.809 --> 01:08:14.829
I mentioned it a few times, but I do guided
trips.

01:08:14.829 --> 01:08:19.470
This year I'll be offering three 7 day trips
up in the high Sierra in Yosemite Valley.

01:08:19.470 --> 01:08:24.920
I'll also be doing one 3 day trip that's much
more a beginner/intermediate trip out at Henry

01:08:24.920 --> 01:08:26.680
Coe State Park.

01:08:26.680 --> 01:08:30.450
It's the middle of May, I believe it's the
14th through the 16th.

01:08:30.450 --> 01:08:32.330
It's a Friday through a Sunday.

01:08:32.330 --> 01:08:37.370
The whole objective is to learn about and
apply the gear, supplies, and skills that

01:08:37.370 --> 01:08:39.410
we've discussed today, plus a lot more.

01:08:39.410 --> 01:08:43.100
If you're interested in one of those trips,
on one of the tables or one of the chairs

01:08:43.100 --> 01:08:44.760
back there, there was some pamphlets.

01:08:44.760 --> 01:08:47.210
But I'll leave some up here as well.

01:08:47.210 --> 01:08:48.670
Just some information.

01:08:48.670 --> 01:08:50.550
That's all also up on my website.

01:08:50.550 --> 01:08:51.720
All right.

01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:52.720
Thank you very much, guys.

01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:53.720
Appreciate it.

01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:53.721
