JHYUN CHUNG: Hello, everyone.

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:06.060
Thank you for standing
in that long line.

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.119
Well, the weather's
beautiful today,

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:09.500
but I really appreciate it.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:10.000
Hi.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.800
My name is Jhyun Chung.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.900
I'm a business development
manager in Google Play.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.140
In my daily job, I work
with Korean developers

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:19.570
based in Seoul.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:25.290
And internally, I lead a team
of other BDs to help you guys

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:30.960
do better in your Go Global
efforts, more focused on apps.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.980
In this session, I will
talk about the opportunities

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.110
of the APAC market, especially
focusing on Japan, Korea,

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:40.550
Southeast Asia.

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.430
You saw it on the title,
but we'll be also talking

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.760
about Taiwan and Hong Kong.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.560
And we will talk about
the users in that market,

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.810
also about experiences
from other developers'

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:56.590
success stories, and the
tips and Google tools

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.900
that you can go back home and
start implementing right away.

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.080
So I'm not the first
one telling you this,

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.780
but Google Play is
truly a global platform,

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.470
and you can reach
almost anywhere

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.770
in the world with Google Play.

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.770
I would like to start with
a code that I really love.

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.860
We hear developers say that
Google Play has fundamentally

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.010
changed the way how
they do business.

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:30.720
And in the case of
smart study, the CEO

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.140
gave this wonderful code.

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.510
They open doors
through Play, but went

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:45.480
beyond Play maybe to YouTube and
to retail presence and so on.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.080
So Google Play just
was the trigger

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.620
to expand their
business globally.

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.620
It's like-- I don't know
if you know this animation.

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:01.610
There's a Japanese character
who has this magical door where

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:02.980
he opens it.

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:07.000
He can basically enter any
place that he wants to go.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.595
I feel that Google Play
is that door for you.

00:02:10.595 --> 00:02:15.260
You could open and go into any
market that you want to go.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.110
And today, we're going
to open the markets APAC.

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:25.430
The Asian market is the
single largest market

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.080
that we have on Play.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.560
According to App
Annie, the countries

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.540
that I will cover today--
Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Hong

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.400
Kong, and Southeast
Asia-- they make

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.740
the 50% of total revenue
in the mobile app business.

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.800
That's basically the
half of the market.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:52.220
So does this portion
resonate with your business?

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.720
No.

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:53.220
Yes.

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.190
Yes and no.

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.700
If it doesn't, this may mean
this much more opportunity

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.260
of your business to grow.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.900
Not only APAC is
all about revenue.

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.890
It's about huge growth
in install base.

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:11.850
Again, according
to App Annie, we

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.550
see that the instill
growth rate, especially

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:19.100
in Southeast Asia, is
54% higher than that

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:20.750
of the global average.

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.210
It's really a great
growth that we're

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:26.310
seeing in these APAC markets.

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.510
But the reality
is not that easy.

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:30.700
It's not rosy.

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.360
How many of you
know all the games

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.990
that you see on this screen?

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:37.380
It's a screen shot
that I took from Korea

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.760
in top grossing chart
ranking yesterday.

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.085
Do recognize the games?

00:03:43.085 --> 00:03:43.585
Anyone?

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.470
Well, as you can see, there
aren't many global titles

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.960
that you easily recognize from.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.670
Let's move on to Japan.

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:57.390
I took it on the same day.

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.870
Do you see any duplicates?

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:01.820
Can you recognize?

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:03.960
It's kind of difficult, right?

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:05.320
Actually there is one.

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:09.830
And not a lot of
global titles again.

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:12.840
What this means is
local developers

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.880
are really dominating
these markets.

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.860
So a really tough
competition there.

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:23.260
And does this sound
like a barrier?

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:24.510
Does this discourage you?

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.850
One of the human errors
that we easily make

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:34.440
is we make conclusions
too fast even

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.230
if we don't know the full
information to base off

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:39.980
that conclusion.

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:45.940
So today, let's talk about
what would be the key levers

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:48.940
to move the needles
in APAC market,

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:52.340
and let's have it and
take it on your business

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:57.080
and really explore together
what could work better for you.

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.710
So what makes it so different?

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:03.010
Before I go into
the details, let

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:04.420
me ask you a quick question.

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:06.380
How many of you are
game developers?

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.490
Raise your hand.

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:09.630
OK.

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:11.660
A little less than I expected.

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:15.650
How many of you are non-game
developers, app developers?

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:16.490
Great.

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.090
OK.

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:21.120
And some of you are
just in between.

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.530
That's good if you're starting
and you're recruiting,

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:25.510
that's still fine.

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:28.620
There is a old Asian
Confucius saying

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.070
that if three people walk
together, at least one of them

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:33.360
is my teacher.

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:39.740
Meaning, if it doesn't directly
applies to your business,

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:42.100
take a learning from
there, understand

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:50.150
what is behind that logic, and
take it into your business.

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:52.760
App developers can
learn from games.

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:55.040
Games can also learn from apps.

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:56.406
So let's do that.

00:05:56.406 --> 00:05:57.780
Let's have that
mindset together.

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:02.200
So on the very
basic-- when we talk

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:07.610
about going global, very easy
pitfalls that developers fall

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:11.840
into would be they
think it's OK enough

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:15.710
to build an app that works
well in their country, which

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:17.800
could be making sense.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:22.830
Because if you're just going to
the local market, that's fine.

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:25.580
But if you're going
to the global market,

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:27.770
this is totally a
different story.

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:31.070
You have to be aware that
infrastructure is very much

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:33.340
different--
connectivity, device.

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:35.540
And even with the
mature markets,

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:38.920
the device situation might
be very much different.

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:40.540
For example, I'm from Korea.

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:42.420
Korans love big screen.

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:44.990
We call them phablets.

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:47.170
And the economy
could be different

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:50.310
even if the market seems good.

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:54.000
The purchasing power
of users are different.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.790
And sometimes even though all
these other technical scenes

00:06:56.790 --> 00:07:00.000
seem OK, content policy
could be something

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.620
that could hold your
service from really

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:06.310
going into that market.

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:10.840
And app market size itself and
the maturity of the app market

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:12.720
is one of the things
that you should

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:15.530
consider before going global.

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:18.330
But I'm not going to
go into details on this

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:20.540
because we have a wonderful
session coming right

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:21.480
after this.

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:24.780
It's Building for Billions
happening on stage five.

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:28.350
So after this, you're
interested in more

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:32.030
in building for emerging
markets, go to stage five

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:33.250
and check that out.

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:36.730
So back to what makes
Asian different.

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:39.230
We just love
different characters,

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:42.530
and we love the characters
in a way a little bit

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:45.710
different from Western culture.

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:49.560
Of course there are loyal
fans of characters everywhere,

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:56.920
but in Asia, it's more like
it's embedded to our lives.

00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:01.180
This is an example of Pokemon
game from the Pokemon company.

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:05.230
And as you can see, just
imagine from the structure,

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:08.810
the game itself is something
that you might easily

00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:11.050
understand what the logic is.

00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:14.520
But this game is a hit,
and the users love it

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:17.230
because they love the Pokemon.

00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:19.940
And another difference
between Western and Eastern

00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:23.270
is about the high
context culture.

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:28.370
This may have started from
Chinese characters conveying

00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:31.560
a lot of meanings
in single words.

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:34.059
This is Mixi's Monster Strike.

00:08:34.059 --> 00:08:38.370
And there are promotional images
from-- on the left side, Japan,

00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:40.370
on the right side, global.

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:42.980
This is so apparent
difference, right?

00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:46.410
For Japanese users, if you give
them the screen on the right,

00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:51.820
they would feel like something
is missing or this is foreign.

00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:53.790
If on the Western
eyes, if you see

00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:56.980
the image on the left
sides, you will think,

00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:59.680
oh they need a designer.

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:02.040
So keep that in mind.

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:05.180
And I want you to
pay close attention

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:07.640
to this part, the
live operation.

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:10.540
Have any of you heard
about the live operation?

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:12.410
Raise your hand if you have.

00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:13.200
Oh good.

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:13.980
Yeah.

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:17.320
I will take simple
examples of life operations

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:19.020
to give you an idea.

00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:22.450
It's basically a stage
of app that evolves

00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:24.530
with the user interaction.

00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:29.760
One of the early stage of live
operation will be live chatting

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:33.580
with the users through
game master, AKA GM's.

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:35.850
Game developers, you
would know what it is.

00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:38.140
You have a accounts
within the game

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:41.090
and a chatting system
within the game,

00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:44.690
and Game Masters reaches
out to users asking,

00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:46.730
you know, I think you're
enjoying this game,

00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:49.640
but you could even enjoy this
game even more if you do this.

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:51.810
Or they get their feedback.

00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:53.750
Somebody would say,
well, this game

00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:56.630
is getting kind of
boring after stage 43.

00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:59.770
And then the Game Master
could understand and take that

00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:02.180
and implement it
in a way that could

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:04.030
be more interesting to users.

00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:08.300
It's a very good way of
engaging with the users.

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:12.410
Recently, the successes we
have seen in live operation is

00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:15.200
the collaboration with the IP's.

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:18.190
This, again, is the example
from Mixi's Monster Strike.

00:10:18.190 --> 00:10:22.700
They partner with Japan's long
loved character, Evangelion.

00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:26.690
And they took the
world of Evangelion

00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:31.770
and placed it in the game,
and users, they just love it.

00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:34.455
And this is what keeps
the users engaging

00:10:34.455 --> 00:10:40.260
and keeps new user inflow even
though game has been out there

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:43.620
for more than several months.

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:46.350
And live operations
are doing events

00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:50.080
at the right moment
at the right time.

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:55.770
You see this is a revenue graph
from an actual developer based

00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:58.790
in Korea and Japan.

00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:01.060
And you see a lot of spikes.

00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:04.990
That is not usual
for other markets,

00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:09.080
and this is because we have
direct carrier billing, which

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:12.480
has a cap that refreshes on
the first day of the month.

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:17.800
So people, they have a budget
that they can spend more on.

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:22.150
And as you can see, the spike
gets even bigger and bigger

00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:27.020
because developers who really do
the live operations right take

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:32.640
the moments and give the best
of events and promotions that

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:34.390
users cannot say no to.

00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:38.040
And it's the time where they
have a willingness to pay,

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:40.040
full willingness to pay.

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:42.545
A good example would be
a Netmarble Future Fight.

00:11:42.545 --> 00:11:43.630
I love this game.

00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:48.620
I've been having so much time
finding the characters I love.

00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:52.290
In this game, they had a
promotion on the Black Friday.

00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:55.270
You might have done
similar stuffs already.

00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:59.300
And they announced with
a really nice deal.

00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:04.270
And they saw 869%
increase in revenue

00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:07.010
compared to the previous
day, which means

00:12:07.010 --> 00:12:09.190
they're creating the spikes.

00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:12.460
And in a game, if
you want to keep

00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:17.530
the lifetime of the
game longer and longer,

00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:20.780
these spikes are really
necessary to keep the revenue

00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:21.280
growing.

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:27.860
It means that users are engaging
back to your service or game.

00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:31.950
So what I call told you
was about the differences

00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:35.710
between somewhat Western
and Eastern cultures.

00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:39.390
Now I will talk about even
more differences among the APAC

00:12:39.390 --> 00:12:41.230
countries.

00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:46.290
So this is the icon
screenshot of Japan and Korea.

00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:49.590
Can you feel the difference?

00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:50.380
Yeah.

00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:54.530
So in our team, we would say,
if they don't have a nose,

00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:56.410
it's Japanese icon.

00:12:56.410 --> 00:12:58.320
If they have a nose
and it's a women

00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:02.530
and they're very slim and
beautiful, it's usually Korean.

00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:11.600
The users like different
types of images,

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:14.800
and they even like different
type of game plays.

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:18.980
For Korean, it's more about
PVP, meaning one-to-one battles.

00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:23.810
And for Japan, it's not
that people don't enjoy PVP,

00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:27.830
it's more like Japanese users
prefer collaborative play

00:13:27.830 --> 00:13:29.740
a little more.

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:32.200
So to give you a
better idea, let

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:37.580
me show you-- and it's a good
clips-- of their TV commercials

00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:39.712
showing this difference.

00:13:39.712 --> 00:13:40.900
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:43.480
This is Korean Game,
Netmarble's KON.

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:44.146
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:13:44.146 --> 00:13:46.020
-[SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:51.170
JHYUN CHUNG: It's
based on one PVP play.

00:13:51.170 --> 00:14:05.850
-[SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:08.215
-You are in KON.

00:14:08.215 --> 00:14:09.610
[END PLAYBACK]

00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:12.220
JHYUN CHUNG: So the video
is very much focused

00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:14.290
on single person, right?

00:14:14.290 --> 00:14:18.185
And let's take a look
at Mixi's TV commercial.

00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:27.350
Now, you see a lot of
people to begin with.

00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:32.850
And they have
incorporated this culture

00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:36.910
of matsuri, which is
festival within the game

00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:39.490
to show that this
is sort of a game

00:14:39.490 --> 00:14:42.970
that you can take the feeling
of matsuri into your phone

00:14:42.970 --> 00:14:46.170
and experience that
collaborative play.

00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:50.790
So it is so different even
among the APAC market.

00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:54.750
So what you have to do-- I'm
not trying to discourage you--

00:14:54.750 --> 00:14:57.790
what I'm trying
to tell you is you

00:14:57.790 --> 00:14:59.650
need to understand
there could be

00:14:59.650 --> 00:15:03.260
even more differences in the
markets where you don't know.

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.260
And if you explore
a little more,

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.280
you'll be able to
see and pick up

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:11.850
this kind of little
subtle differences

00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:14.900
that works well
in these markets.

00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:17.170
Let's explore what
you can actually

00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:19.450
do better in APAC markets.

00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:23.020
I'll try to break down
into four sections.

00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:25.810
First three is more
like a process.

00:15:25.810 --> 00:15:29.390
You have to understand your
market, plan it, and go.

00:15:29.390 --> 00:15:34.150
And second, we will talk about
how to better localize the app.

00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:37.020
And third, I will
explain a little bit more

00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:39.650
in depth about live
operation and how

00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:44.470
you would want to do operations
in that local country.

00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:46.740
And lastly, we will
tell you about what

00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:50.660
you can use from Google's
tools to make this more

00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:53.260
easier for you.

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.950
These are seasonings,
images of seasonings

00:15:55.950 --> 00:15:58.140
sold in Southeast Asia market.

00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:00.320
So if you want to casually
cook for yourself,

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:02.975
whatever, like
exotic dishes, you

00:16:02.975 --> 00:16:05.150
could just follow the
recipe and put everything

00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:06.630
that they tell you to do.

00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:09.900
But if you want to be a cook and
if you want to sell your dish,

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:12.290
you really have to understand
the ingredients that

00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:13.540
goes within.

00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:17.440
So in this part, I'll tell you
about a little bit of facts

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:23.490
and some of the insights
of the APAC market.

00:16:23.490 --> 00:16:26.360
And before we move onto
that, before knowing

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:29.260
what is out there, you have
to know your intentions.

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:30.230
What is your priority?

00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:31.438
What's more important to you?

00:16:31.438 --> 00:16:32.290
Is it revenue?

00:16:32.290 --> 00:16:34.010
Or is it install?

00:16:34.010 --> 00:16:37.130
This makes difference
in which countries

00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:39.580
that you will want
to focus first.

00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:43.010
For Japan and Korea, it's a
country with a lot of revenue

00:16:43.010 --> 00:16:45.320
and great number of installs.

00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:49.430
But the cost of
marketing it's very high.

00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:52.510
Contrary to that,
Southeast Asia,

00:16:52.510 --> 00:16:57.020
it has huge install potential,
and the cost of marketing

00:16:57.020 --> 00:16:58.480
is low.

00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:03.880
So if your priority is clearly
on the other side, check.

00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:06.319
It's a easy decision
you can make.

00:17:06.319 --> 00:17:09.540
But if you want to
go to everywhere,

00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:11.089
try Taiwan and Hong Kong.

00:17:11.089 --> 00:17:15.630
They have users with high ARPPU,
average spending per spending

00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:18.310
users, and they're
very much loyal.

00:17:18.310 --> 00:17:22.630
So if you want to test
out your service or game,

00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:26.400
these markets could be a
good place to start with.

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:29.150
Now, when we talk about
Southeast Asia market,

00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:33.490
we're talking about these
six key markets-- Singapore,

00:17:33.490 --> 00:17:37.550
Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia,
Philippines, and Vietnam.

00:17:37.550 --> 00:17:40.380
And we talked about
installs, but they

00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:44.180
do make a sizable revenue
in Indonesia, Philippines,

00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:46.330
and Vietnam.

00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:49.720
And since we have the
map, I did a little dot

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:53.790
drawing across of what
type of game category

00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:55.790
works best in each region.

00:17:55.790 --> 00:18:00.830
And it was interesting
because on the northern side

00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:03.940
of these countries, we see
hardcore RPGs doing really

00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:04.870
well.

00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:09.760
On the below, we see
more of a diverse type

00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:11.130
of game doing well.

00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:12.905
This could be due
to several reasons,

00:18:12.905 --> 00:18:18.500
and it could be due to
the device performance,

00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:21.320
but this is how it is.

00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:24.080
And the other thing
that I've tried doing

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:28.500
was to color based on what
messenger platform works

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:30.170
best for each region.

00:18:30.170 --> 00:18:33.820
I thought I would see
some dominant color,

00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:35.090
but it betrayed me.

00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:39.500
And there's a lot of diverse
colors in this map, which

00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:45.650
means if you want to use the
best out of each platforms,

00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:48.700
you may have to think
about having strategies

00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:51.770
for each market,
multiple builds.

00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:55.100
But we have prepared
Play Games service

00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:58.840
and Google sign in that you
can use in all these countries.

00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:01.570
So if you want to
scale your business,

00:19:01.570 --> 00:19:06.080
you can use our social logins.

00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:10.040
And preparing your
app from the start.

00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:11.880
Material design works well.

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:15.700
Prepare to have your
app strings separated so

00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:17.780
that you can easily update.

00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:21.030
And system elements
are really different

00:19:21.030 --> 00:19:22.060
among these countries.

00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:24.160
And if you haven't
taken them out,

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:27.010
users might feel the
service [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:27.010 --> 00:19:29.940
Few examples-- material design.

00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:33.680
Asian users are already
very much educated

00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:38.660
in how the material design is,
how Android foreign factors

00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:39.690
play in.

00:19:39.690 --> 00:19:42.830
So you don't have to
teach the users how

00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:46.600
to use the app if you use
basic structure of the material

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:47.710
design.

00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:51.460
And I told you about
separating the app strings

00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:53.920
because language
is all different.

00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:57.610
Even for Taiwan and Hong Kong,
they use traditional Chinese.

00:19:57.610 --> 00:20:02.260
But if you want to have voice
control or have audio content,

00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:04.860
they speak a different Chinese.

00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:06.620
Cantonese and Mandarin.

00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:09.430
And Indonesia, Bahasa
works really well

00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:12.840
if you want to pick
up the performance.

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:19.720
And on the system elements
side, if a dating app asked me--

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:23.010
I'm born and raised in
Korea-- and they ask me,

00:20:23.010 --> 00:20:25.820
how tall are you
in feet and inches?

00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:28.410
I can't answer
because I don't know.

00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:31.830
I know that I'm 167
centimeters high,

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:33.670
but I don't know it in feet.

00:20:33.670 --> 00:20:37.180
So if you give that
to Asian users what

00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:40.690
you are most used to in US,
that doesn't work that way.

00:20:40.690 --> 00:20:45.570
So please be prepared that
the units will be different.

00:20:45.570 --> 00:20:48.560
Also same with the days.

00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:50.890
Now, we touched a brief
about ingredients.

00:20:50.890 --> 00:20:53.810
You can always learn
more on yourself.

00:20:53.810 --> 00:20:57.850
So let's talk about the
cooking, localization.

00:20:57.850 --> 00:21:00.590
So when you it comes
to localization,

00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:03.660
we say that it is a
process for those who

00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:05.420
are just starting to localize.

00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:08.930
If you're already an expert,
just go dive into it.

00:21:08.930 --> 00:21:11.380
But if you're starting
to do a localization,

00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:13.410
this could be in a process.

00:21:13.410 --> 00:21:15.020
So start simple.

00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:19.790
Just try using auto translation
in your app description.

00:21:19.790 --> 00:21:25.100
Because just by doing that,
is opening your front door

00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:28.650
to the new users and
inviting them to come in.

00:21:28.650 --> 00:21:31.730
And if you think
you see some actions

00:21:31.730 --> 00:21:34.160
or responses from
that market, now you

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:36.500
can start getting more serious.

00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:39.260
Let them know that
you are starting

00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:44.670
to care for them in their
market by translating your app.

00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:48.580
And in the third phase, you
have to really go in and operate

00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:51.980
in local language
in a native voice.

00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:56.160
In the Play store, you can
localize the trailer, icon,

00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:58.950
title, description,
and key images.

00:21:58.950 --> 00:22:02.460
And this may sound
easy, or this may sound

00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:04.620
very difficult to some of you.

00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:08.280
But there are developers
who do it in a perfection.

00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:10.350
This is Polaris
Office from Korea

00:22:10.350 --> 00:22:14.510
and their app promotional
screen in Japan.

00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:18.510
My Japan colleague,
Evan, right over there.

00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:20.770
He told me that it's
hard for Japanese

00:22:20.770 --> 00:22:22.980
to even think about
that this app is not

00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:25.660
for a Japanese developer
because they reached

00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:27.710
to a point of perfection.

00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:30.420
If you see in the image,
they show the examples

00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:33.620
within the app in Japanese.

00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:38.970
And that sort of detail
can lead users to feel

00:22:38.970 --> 00:22:42.330
more attached to the service.

00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:46.440
And on the Cookpad
side, they not only

00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:48.900
localize the listings
in the language,

00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:51.680
they localize with the
local food content.

00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:57.380
So they would show the food
that the local users would most

00:22:57.380 --> 00:22:58.100
love.

00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:00.450
And if you want
to see the impact,

00:23:00.450 --> 00:23:03.690
one password I've
worked with the team.

00:23:03.690 --> 00:23:04.790
It's Canadian team.

00:23:04.790 --> 00:23:06.220
I love the team.

00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:11.130
And it only took them two weeks
to finish up their localization

00:23:11.130 --> 00:23:14.230
because they had it ready
in their apps streams.

00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:18.810
And right after that, they
saw 100% increase in install

00:23:18.810 --> 00:23:20.240
in Korean market.

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:26.420
I think this is something
that is easy for you

00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:28.410
to make decision on.

00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:33.640
But not all services are
utility, or it's simple.

00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:36.420
But just think that how
much potential it brings

00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:39.170
once you just start localizing.

00:23:39.170 --> 00:23:42.910
So went to choose between
single and multiple builds.

00:23:42.910 --> 00:23:48.930
If your app is targeting more
to-- we saw the social services

00:23:48.930 --> 00:23:51.980
with [INAUDIBLE], the
specific market service,

00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:54.630
you should think about
building multiple builds.

00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:57.230
But then it means
more resources,

00:23:57.230 --> 00:24:00.260
engineering resources
needed for you,

00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:04.380
but the service and the content
will be much more tailored

00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:05.750
to local users.

00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:08.570
If you want to
keep a scale of it,

00:24:08.570 --> 00:24:11.360
single build is your answer.

00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:13.170
And even within
the single build,

00:24:13.170 --> 00:24:15.530
you can still localize
the business model.

00:24:15.530 --> 00:24:19.200
The alarm clock app--
they have a lot of items.

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:23.320
They placed the strategy
differently among the regions.

00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:27.920
So for example, in Japan,
they have 35 paid items.

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:31.800
In contrary to Southeast Asia
markets, they only have 15.

00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:35.390
But the ads frequency is
very high in that market.

00:24:35.390 --> 00:24:41.360
So balance up your monetization
strategy based on the country.

00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:43.520
And sub dollar pricing works.

00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:45.780
We have enabled
sub dollar pricing

00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:47.870
in 18 countries in Google Play.

00:24:50.610 --> 00:24:53.910
I told you about the
economy and the purchasing

00:24:53.910 --> 00:24:55.760
power of each country.

00:24:55.760 --> 00:25:01.510
And in some other countries,
$1 doesn't mean a single item.

00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:04.240
It means like your days wage.

00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:07.750
So in that countries,
lower your prices.

00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:10.890
And then you not only
get more revenue,

00:25:10.890 --> 00:25:13.720
you get more engaging users.

00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:16.920
And if you're interested
on earning money on Play,

00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:19.500
we have a session prepared
9 AM tomorrow morning.

00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:20.380
It's early.

00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:20.910
I know.

00:25:20.910 --> 00:25:22.060
It's the last day.

00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:23.810
But this is worth your time.

00:25:23.810 --> 00:25:25.330
Please go and check out.

00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:27.330
OK.

00:25:27.330 --> 00:25:28.850
So you have
understood the market.

00:25:28.850 --> 00:25:32.810
You have your app ready
in perfect localization.

00:25:32.810 --> 00:25:35.350
Now, what's your next step?

00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:36.860
What do you have to do?

00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:39.880
Now you have to really
dive into that sea,

00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:42.540
to that ocean with a high tide.

00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:47.970
Operate your app
with the local voice.

00:25:47.970 --> 00:25:51.500
So DomiNations by
Nexon-- they communicate

00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:54.590
with users in Japanese
when they leave

00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:56.910
response in their reviews.

00:25:56.910 --> 00:26:01.150
And coming back to the Mixi's
case on live operation,

00:26:01.150 --> 00:26:04.430
let me give you a little more
detail about what they did.

00:26:04.430 --> 00:26:08.450
So on the first round of
collaboration with Evangelion,

00:26:08.450 --> 00:26:11.820
they had three, four characters
into the balls, which

00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:15.050
is the key of the
game, and they created

00:26:15.050 --> 00:26:21.130
four stages that reflect
the world in the animation.

00:26:21.130 --> 00:26:26.230
And they saw the record
breaking high number of user

00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:29.140
who simultaneously
played the game, which

00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:31.960
is important for
collaborative Play games.

00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:35.250
And on the second round,
they did it after six months.

00:26:35.250 --> 00:26:39.826
They even saw more higher
engagement with end users.

00:26:39.826 --> 00:26:42.380
The record was broken again.

00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:47.050
And this is how you
start engaging users

00:26:47.050 --> 00:26:50.510
back to your service
even you've already

00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:53.110
have a collaboration again.

00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:58.540
And one other thing is I did
this with my Korean developers

00:26:58.540 --> 00:26:59.490
together.

00:26:59.490 --> 00:27:03.100
In Taiwan, there was
a trend sometime.

00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:04.900
Some of you may
know this already.

00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:09.030
So like woman would
stand at the back time

00:27:09.030 --> 00:27:10.510
on the wall with her back.

00:27:10.510 --> 00:27:14.600
And the guy will be
hitting the wall protecting

00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:17.970
or like getting onto the woman.

00:27:17.970 --> 00:27:24.040
And the hitting the wall was
like a buzzword in Taiwan.

00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:26.460
And Korean developers
caught this,

00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:31.830
and they create an in-app item
especially for Taiwan market.

00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:34.390
And the result, users loved it.

00:27:34.390 --> 00:27:37.740
They saw two times
more install just right

00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:41.100
after launching these
new in-app items.

00:27:44.010 --> 00:27:46.050
Sometimes acquisition
really helps.

00:27:46.050 --> 00:27:49.860
Cookpad acquired a lot of
communities and startups

00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:56.160
and recipes in the cook
service content business.

00:27:56.160 --> 00:28:00.030
And it was one of the
most effective way

00:28:00.030 --> 00:28:02.950
of expanding their
boundaries so quickly

00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:07.240
and taking users
from that countries.

00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:09.890
This is the case from
Netmarble's Future Fight.

00:28:09.890 --> 00:28:12.960
When they went into Taiwan,
they did the marketing

00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:16.230
that works in that region.

00:28:16.230 --> 00:28:19.840
So they did Mobile
UA, TVC, Wrapping Bus,

00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:23.000
which probably isn't
familiar to many of you.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.960
And they did a lot of
consumer exhibition and events

00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:28.250
to engage more with the users.

00:28:28.250 --> 00:28:30.350
They invested.

00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:32.750
This case is EvilBane
with Netmarble.

00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:35.025
You can also collaborate
with local celebrities

00:28:35.025 --> 00:28:37.710
or local influencers.

00:28:37.710 --> 00:28:42.000
In that way, users feel that
through the local celebrated

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:47.000
image, that game or app service
is more relevant to you.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.070
Alarm Mon did a really
creative CPG collaboration

00:28:51.070 --> 00:28:53.110
with a juice bottle.

00:28:53.110 --> 00:28:58.140
They had a QR code in the
juice leading to the website

00:28:58.140 --> 00:29:01.490
where it showed about the app.

00:29:01.490 --> 00:29:04.900
And after this,
they saw two times

00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:07.420
the growth in that market.

00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:09.850
By now, I hope you
have the chance

00:29:09.850 --> 00:29:13.010
to think about what
you could start trying

00:29:13.010 --> 00:29:15.210
and what you could
implement in your market.

00:29:15.210 --> 00:29:19.210
Let me tell you about
the Google tools.

00:29:19.210 --> 00:29:23.400
If you're at the first
stage of going global,

00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:27.870
use the APK translation service
in our developer console.

00:29:27.870 --> 00:29:31.510
It is not a perfect quality,
but it is good enough

00:29:31.510 --> 00:29:34.640
for the local eyes.

00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:39.060
And we recently announced that
if you have a local pricing,

00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:43.550
we now round up the currency
to something that makes

00:29:43.550 --> 00:29:46.150
more sense in the local market.

00:29:46.150 --> 00:29:50.400
And you could price it
in a way that you want.

00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:52.570
But the thing you
have to keep in mind

00:29:52.570 --> 00:29:57.020
is always launch, test,
and iterate the process

00:29:57.020 --> 00:29:59.610
to see what really
works for your region.

00:29:59.610 --> 00:30:02.030
And you can do this
through analyzing

00:30:02.030 --> 00:30:06.030
the users in conversion funnel
in the developer console.

00:30:06.030 --> 00:30:11.370
Now you can see by the
countries which country had

00:30:11.370 --> 00:30:15.850
the most install and the
conversion rate of that country

00:30:15.850 --> 00:30:18.140
was how much.

00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:22.400
And you can also analyze
the ratings by the country

00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:27.100
and understand what is wrong
with certain countries.

00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:31.680
Even we translate the feedbacks
for you in your language.

00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:36.270
And a case that I want to share
is Creative [INAUDIBLE] Potu.

00:30:36.270 --> 00:30:41.330
It's a very pretty pink
dolphin, kids app, lovely.

00:30:41.330 --> 00:30:47.760
But one day they saw a huge drop
in user rating in Philippines.

00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:49.680
That is after they launched.

00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:55.050
And one of the user feedback was
that Boto meant something bad

00:30:55.050 --> 00:30:56.460
in Philippines.

00:30:56.460 --> 00:30:59.030
So they took the
response from that review

00:30:59.030 --> 00:31:01.060
and changed the name Potu.

00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:05.250
And after that, they're doing
great in the Philippines.

00:31:05.250 --> 00:31:07.720
And do a lot of store
listing experiments.

00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:10.470
You can A/B test your
icons, your app description,

00:31:10.470 --> 00:31:12.370
your trailers.

00:31:12.370 --> 00:31:14.670
Tell you a case
about Monster Strikes

00:31:14.670 --> 00:31:16.550
international expansion.

00:31:16.550 --> 00:31:18.030
They tested their icon.

00:31:18.030 --> 00:31:19.690
This is the winner.

00:31:19.690 --> 00:31:22.970
They also tested the
app descriptions--

00:31:22.970 --> 00:31:25.710
like the key
description messages.

00:31:25.710 --> 00:31:29.040
And they tested the
screen shot and the video.

00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:33.380
In a way, they planned to
see the maximum efforts.

00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:38.670
And after this, they saw
60% increase in conversion

00:31:38.670 --> 00:31:40.640
before and after the test.

00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:43.900
And in a world where
the marketing costs

00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:46.400
cost per install is
going higher and higher,

00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:48.780
improving the conversion
rate is really

00:31:48.780 --> 00:31:51.300
critical for the business.

00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:57.840
And then afterwards, they start
testing the in app experiences.

00:31:57.840 --> 00:32:00.640
If you want to know
more about game side

00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:04.880
and about how to be more
successful in Google Play,

00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:08.010
you have a session
tomorrow 10 AM.

00:32:08.010 --> 00:32:11.810
So try not miss it again.

00:32:11.810 --> 00:32:14.280
I show you some
examples from Netmarble.

00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:18.660
We have Netmarble's Duke, coming
in to speak for the event.

00:32:18.660 --> 00:32:21.740
So you'll be able to hear
more about the examples

00:32:21.740 --> 00:32:23.550
that he can give.

00:32:23.550 --> 00:32:28.540
OK so kind of wrapping all
the things that I discussed,

00:32:28.540 --> 00:32:31.930
I'll share two success
cases from developers.

00:32:31.930 --> 00:32:35.960
And this will kind of
help you to organize

00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:37.930
what we have discussed today.

00:32:37.930 --> 00:32:42.950
Joycity's Game of Dice
was success in Hong Kong.

00:32:42.950 --> 00:32:45.260
Do you remember
that I said you have

00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:49.240
to plan ahead of your strategy?

00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:52.460
Game of Dice planned the
localization strategy

00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:53.980
before they launch.

00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:57.130
So they had a team
who could best

00:32:57.130 --> 00:33:01.650
localize in the local
language by including

00:33:01.650 --> 00:33:05.210
traditional Chinese speaker
and simplified Chinese speaker

00:33:05.210 --> 00:33:08.520
and having a check and balance
process within the localization

00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:09.700
team.

00:33:09.700 --> 00:33:13.300
And then they would check
the localization level

00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:16.820
with the Korean team
in a processed way

00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:22.990
so that they don't
miss out a single word.

00:33:22.990 --> 00:33:25.700
And the [INAUDIBLE],
they collaborated

00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:29.900
with celebrity that's very
popular in Hong Kong market.

00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:32.770
And they collaborated
with YouTube creators

00:33:32.770 --> 00:33:40.800
to let the game know in a
more familiar way to users.

00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:43.250
But the importance of
A/B testing is here.

00:33:43.250 --> 00:33:48.160
They thought celebrity icons
would work better than the game

00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:49.370
character image icons.

00:33:49.370 --> 00:33:52.120
But when they
tested it, actually

00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:56.950
the game character image
worked better in performance.

00:33:56.950 --> 00:34:02.180
So you have to test an area to
see what works best for you.

00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:06.630
They did marketing that makes
sense in the local markets.

00:34:06.630 --> 00:34:08.179
They create Webtoons.

00:34:08.179 --> 00:34:11.560
In the subway, they
created engaging videos

00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:14.239
that explain of the game play.

00:34:14.239 --> 00:34:17.500
And they wrapped buses.

00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:22.380
And I will show you the
Musixmatch's win in Japan.

00:34:22.380 --> 00:34:23.889
So truth or myth?

00:34:23.889 --> 00:34:27.409
Honestly, the DD's,
like us, we thought

00:34:27.409 --> 00:34:29.800
Japan market is
almost impossible

00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:35.110
to crack in terms of service or
content from developers abroad.

00:34:35.110 --> 00:34:37.730
But Musixmatch did it.

00:34:37.730 --> 00:34:38.810
They localize.

00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:43.730
They even localized the app
experience for Japanese users.

00:34:43.730 --> 00:34:46.239
And what they saw
is 300% increase,

00:34:46.239 --> 00:34:51.550
and they was ranked number one
in music category in Japan.

00:34:51.550 --> 00:34:56.420
What they did was they
personalized to Japanese users,

00:34:56.420 --> 00:35:00.120
localized deeply
of all the things

00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:03.180
that they can localize
in play, and they

00:35:03.180 --> 00:35:07.200
did a lot of A/B testing, did
analytics from the developer

00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:14.520
console, and really worked
with the local market

00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:18.380
experts on FGIs and
learning more and more

00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:20.760
of the local market.

00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:22.820
I told you in the
opening session

00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:25.680
how Google Play is
the magical door,

00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:28.920
and the door is open
for all of the you.

00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:31.870
It's open for everyone
who wants to go

00:35:31.870 --> 00:35:34.970
and dive into new markets.

00:35:34.970 --> 00:35:37.760
We will keep listening to
the feedbacks that you have

00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:41.760
and difficulties that you had
going into the global market.

00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:44.810
And we will make the product
better and better for you.

00:35:44.810 --> 00:35:46.510
You already have
a better product

00:35:46.510 --> 00:35:52.420
that announce this time
with more countries

00:35:52.420 --> 00:35:56.520
that you can test your A/B
testing on simultaneously

00:35:56.520 --> 00:36:01.810
and of the price charming, price
roundings, that we provide.

00:36:01.810 --> 00:36:06.820
So keep trying, and let us know
what works and what doesn't.

00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:14.120
And we'll try our best to be
better platform for you too.

00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:18.310

you can update on the Spaces.

00:36:18.310 --> 00:36:21.680
And since I have
five minutes left,

00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:26.200
I may be able to take one or
two questions from the audience.

00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:27.720
The mic is in the center.

00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:31.890
If you have a question,
you can do this.

00:36:31.890 --> 00:36:36.980
And I will have my friend
BD's from other regions.

00:36:36.980 --> 00:36:40.540
Raise your hand if
you're a BE for Korea.

00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:45.910
There's people who are part
responsible for these APAC

00:36:45.910 --> 00:36:46.410
markets.

00:36:46.410 --> 00:36:48.930

00:36:50.850 --> 00:36:52.350
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:54.450 --> 00:36:57.500
