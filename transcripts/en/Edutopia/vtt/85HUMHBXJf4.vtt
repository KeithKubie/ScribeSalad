00:00:02.486 --> 00:00:03.226
&gt;&gt;Karl: When we work together,

00:00:03.226 --> 00:00:05.446
we are able to create something
great for our students.

00:00:06.906 --> 00:00:10.806
That collaboration creates an
amazing school environment.

00:00:18.666 --> 00:00:22.246
&gt;&gt;Mary Beth: One of the biggest
challenges of any school is people go

00:00:22.246 --> 00:00:23.956
into their rooms and
they close their doors

00:00:23.956 --> 00:00:26.086
and that's the way teaching
used to be, right?

00:00:27.486 --> 00:00:31.936
So you have to begin making it
not okay to close your door.

00:00:33.046 --> 00:00:35.926
&gt;&gt;Karl: So often we hold all the
good things we do to ourselves

00:00:35.926 --> 00:00:38.016
because it becomes kind
of like a competition.

00:00:38.326 --> 00:00:41.566
&gt;&gt;Georgia: But when you're able to
collaborate with your colleagues,

00:00:42.006 --> 00:00:44.836
it really affects the
students' education.

00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:47.186
&gt;&gt;I'm not sure we're
having the exact same idea.

00:00:47.246 --> 00:00:50.316
&gt;&gt;Mary Beth: In terms of
building a team, you have to think

00:00:50.316 --> 00:00:51.566
about where are the strengths.

00:00:52.336 --> 00:00:56.196
&gt;&gt;Georgia: Our principal saw that I have
this strength and he has that strength,

00:00:56.196 --> 00:00:59.176
so when she put us together,
it was hard at first.

00:00:59.176 --> 00:01:00.486
&gt;&gt;Okay, there are differences
in opinion.

00:01:00.766 --> 00:01:01.736
&gt;&gt;Karl: Yeah, big time.

00:01:01.736 --> 00:01:04.366
&gt;&gt;The truth is, is that we
didn't really like each other.

00:01:04.486 --> 00:01:07.736
&gt;&gt;Georgia: Because we were very
different people, different styles.

00:01:08.056 --> 00:01:11.446
&gt;&gt;Karl: But when we started working
together, we were both passionate

00:01:11.446 --> 00:01:13.826
about working, we were both
willing to put the time in.

00:01:14.086 --> 00:01:15.466
&gt;&gt;Mary Beth: They started
talking to each other.

00:01:15.546 --> 00:01:17.066
"Well, what text are you using?

00:01:17.276 --> 00:01:18.716
How are you making that connection?

00:01:18.906 --> 00:01:20.756
How are you going to run
your writing conference?"

00:01:20.756 --> 00:01:22.856
IT was like the conversation
of the month.

00:01:23.056 --> 00:01:26.696
&gt;&gt;Karl: We're both understanding
that the main goal as a teacher is

00:01:26.696 --> 00:01:28.956
to get those students to learn.

00:01:29.046 --> 00:01:30.356
&gt;&gt;Georgia: Okay, got it.

00:01:30.356 --> 00:01:31.416
&gt;&gt;Karl: Got it?

00:01:31.886 --> 00:01:36.136
&gt;&gt;Teacher collaboration at
Wildwood is really intentional.

00:01:36.856 --> 00:01:40.916
In our schedule, when we have our
preps, they're aligned to each other.

00:01:40.916 --> 00:01:45.946
&gt;&gt;Georgia: I wanted to also talk to you
about our current budgeting activity.

00:01:45.946 --> 00:01:49.876
Do you think they're ready to take a
whole four day, three night vacation

00:01:50.456 --> 00:01:51.856
with the thousand dollar budget?

00:01:52.036 --> 00:01:55.006
&gt;&gt;Karl: We didn't do this last
year as far as doing the activity.

00:01:55.006 --> 00:01:56.786
We did the questions, we
did everything like that,

00:01:56.786 --> 00:01:57.806
but we didn't do the activity.

00:01:57.806 --> 00:01:58.966
&gt;&gt;Georgia: We didn't prep them as much.

00:01:58.966 --> 00:01:59.426
&gt;&gt;Karl: Right.

00:01:59.636 --> 00:02:01.486
That whole area in that project.

00:02:01.486 --> 00:02:02.036
&gt;&gt;Georgia: They struggled.

00:02:02.036 --> 00:02:02.936
&gt;&gt;Karl: Was what they struggled on.

00:02:03.066 --> 00:02:05.126
&gt;&gt;Georgia: Remember, because last
year we also had a few issues

00:02:05.126 --> 00:02:08.596
with the itemized lists, that
they weren't being specific enough

00:02:08.596 --> 00:02:09.256
with the costs.

00:02:09.366 --> 00:02:11.946
&gt;&gt;Karl: What we can do to help them
out with that is like every morning,

00:02:11.946 --> 00:02:13.456
we can have a little mini activity

00:02:13.456 --> 00:02:16.226
that will have budgeting
that they have to do.

00:02:16.496 --> 00:02:19.576
Then moving on into the big
activity, which is this vacation.

00:02:19.676 --> 00:02:21.976
&gt;&gt;Georgia: Yeah, perfect, I like
that, because it's just a little bit,

00:02:21.976 --> 00:02:23.976
we're building every day,
so that's a good idea.

00:02:34.066 --> 00:02:36.736
&gt;&gt;That relationship, when you can
bounce ideas off of each other,

00:02:36.946 --> 00:02:43.156
it's to the benefit of the students.

00:02:43.156 --> 00:02:46.806
&gt;&gt;Karl: We should be helping each other
out and stop holding in all the things

00:02:46.806 --> 00:02:48.936
that we do great, and
sharing it with others

00:02:48.936 --> 00:02:51.686
so that they can make those same
gains within their classroom.

00:02:51.786 --> 00:02:55.166
And that's really what's important about
it, is that the collaboration creates

00:02:55.216 --> 00:02:56.976
that equality for all students.
