00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.381
February is home to one of the most important
holidays of the year not to forget: Groundhog

00:00:04.381 --> 00:00:05.381
Day.

00:00:05.381 --> 00:00:08.460
If you live outside of Can-merica then you
might not know what a groundhog is so... here

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.700
you go: this is a groundhog.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.929
They're basically giant grumpy squirrels who
dig burrows underground.

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:16.929
Burrows large enough, in fact, to occasionally
make their comfy home a structural hazard

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:18.300
to your comfy home.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.789
This explains the first half of their name.

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:23.170
The second half is because they're kind of
fat -- though unlike their fellow Can-mericans

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.400
-- when winter arrives they need their excess
weight to go into hibernation.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.060
The story of the holiday is that on February
2nd the wise groundhogs wake from hibernation

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.119
to peek out of their burrow and look at the
world.

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.410
If they see their shadow they go back inside
which predicts six more weeks of winter.

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.000
If they don't, then spring will come early.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.020
The holiday started in the 1800s as a Pennsylvania
Dutch custom of weather prediction and today

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.520
is celebrated in Canada and 49 of the fifty
states, the exception being Alaska which in

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.190
2009 decided to forgo groundhog day in favor
of marmot day.

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.190
Outside of Alaska, many groundhogs contend
with each other to be the King of Seasonal

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.460
Weather prediction their their main weapon
in this war being their delightful names such

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:56.460
as:

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.060
Queen Charlotte and Sir Walter Wally in North
Carolina,

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:59.550
Shubenacadie Sam of Nova Scotia

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:00.930
Staten Island Chuck from New York

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.690
French Creek Freddie in West Virginia

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:03.690
And...

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.760
Gus from Athens Georgia though this last groundhog
is somewhat overshadowed by his neighbor,

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.280
General Beauregard Lee, who one must assume
has stylish facial hair and fans himself on

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.891
the veranda of his plantation home while drinking
Mint Julep and pining for the day when the

00:01:14.891 --> 00:01:16.159
south will rise again.

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:19.460
1,000 miles north of the General, Wiarton
Willie is the groundhog king of Canada, who

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.950
throws an annual party to help him stay on
top and make sure that people keep building

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.440
epic statues of him.

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.490
But, if there could be only one, Punxsutawney
Phil would be him.

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.500
Not only is his name the most fun to say but
he also has quite a posse of top-hatted, tuxedoed

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.270
men who look after him and call themselves
the inner circle.

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.860
According to them, Punxsutawney Phil has been
making predictions since the 1880s.

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.750
Not a Punxsutawney Phil, mind you, but this
Punxsutawney Phil who is functionally immortal

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.220
because of a magic life-extending elixir the
inner circle members prepare for him so that

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.390
he can continue to make predictions -- and
bring in tourist revenue -- until the end

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.390
of time.

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.170
He also speaks a language called groundhogese
that only the president of the inner circle

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.530
can understand.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.270
If you think that Groundhog day is a dumb,
pointless holiday then, there are two things

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:57.270
you should consider:

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.060
1st: you have no sense of fun and 2nd, you
better be careful on Groundhog day, because

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.159
in addition to their weather predicting day
jobs, these groundhogs also have the magical

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:08.010
power to trap you in a infinite time loop
until you learn to be less of a jerk.

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.710
Happy Groundhog Dayï¿½
