00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.550
CO2 levels are on the rise but they’ve been
way higher before.

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:10.590
So… climate, we cool?

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.840
Hello everyone, Julian here for DNews.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.350
Antarctic CO2 levels finally caught up with
the rest of the world and have an average

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.880
concentration of 400 parts per million.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.810
So for every 1 million particles in the air,
400 of them are Carbon dioxide.

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.770
It’s the highest those levels have been
in 4 million years.

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:30.580
If you’re a person who watches DNews regularly
you might recognize this as a bad thing, but

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.239
if you’re a “climate change is baloney”
type, you may have heard that sentence differently.

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:39.609
If this is the highest Antarctic CO2 has been
in 4 million years, then 4 million years ago

00:00:39.609 --> 00:00:42.940
things were like they are now and we still
turned out ok, right?

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.190
Boom, climate change busted.

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.579
Actually if you ascribe to that argument,
I have even better news for you!

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:53.280
At certain points in earth’s history, like
during the mesozoic in the time of the dinosaurs,

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.930
CO2 concentrations were as high as ten times
what they are now.

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.269
So why’s everybody freaking out about a
measly 400 parts per million?

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:03.890
We asked University of Northridge geochemist
Jenn Cotton exactly that.

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.360
Cotton explained that there are still a lot
of things that separate our current situation

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.270
from the extreme carbon dioxide levels of
the past.

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.890
For one thing, our concentrations are ramping
up a lot faster than they ever did before.

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.570
For most of earth’s history the biggest
emitter of CO2 was volcanic activity, both

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.649
on land and below the ocean, but volcanic
CO2 emissions are fairly slow and steady.

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:29.380
Even during the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum,
temperatures rose 5 to 8C over millennia,

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:30.700
not centuries.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.009
Of course, as a geologist Cotton describes
this as, “a really really rapid warming

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.210
event,” but her sense of timing is a bit
out of whack.

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.299
This is why there are no geologist comedians.

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.230
But over that long period of warming organisms
adapted to their changing environment and

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:47.539
indeed few species went extinct during this
period, which some climate change deniers

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:49.950
use to downplay the impact of modern climate
change.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.329
But in fact, the current rise in temperatures
is happening much much faster than it did

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.560
55 million years ago, and many organisms likely
won’t be able to survive.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.969
Another issue is the average global temperatures
do not increase linearly with CO2, there are

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.649
diminishing returns.

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:09.160
Bumping up concentrations by 100 parts per
million when it’s already at 3000 is not

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.400
going to cause nearly as drastic a change
as if concentrations were at 300 parts per

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.490
million, like they were in 1910.

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:19.850
We’re actually at the lower end of atmospheric
carbon concentrations right now compared to

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.099
most of earth’s history, which means that
the climate is much more sensitive that it

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:25.780
has been historically.

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.980
But if it was so high in the past, won’t
it just come down again?

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.700
Yes, climate change denier it will, but again,
on a geological time scale.

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.950
CO2 is taken out of the air when it mixes
with water in atmosphere and forms carbonic

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:38.950
acid.

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.371
It’s why rain doesn’t have a neutral ph
of 7, it’s typically closer to 5.5 even

00:02:43.371 --> 00:02:45.430
in the absence of any other pollutants.

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.110
The carbonic acid reacts with rocks, breaking
them down, turning them into soil, and being

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.080
converted itself into carbonate.

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:57.019
So, yes, atmospheric CO2 has been more abundant
in the past, but not for millions of years.

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:02.060
That Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum probably
took 10,000 years to hit its peak, and didn’t

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.530
drop to previous levels until 150 thousand
years later.

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.280
Some people refuse to believe climate change
is real because it used to be called global

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.030
warming, and changing names means scientists
must be lying!

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.340
Unless climate change is used because it’s
the more accurate name.

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.319
Trace explains here.

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:34.049
What do you think?

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:40.480
Think we can turn this climate change thing
around in less than 150 thousand years?
