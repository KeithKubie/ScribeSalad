00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:05.320
It's been 25 years since the Hubble launched
and changed how we look at space forever,

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:12.320
but even though it's probably the most famous
-- there are 93 space telescopes out there!

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.550
WHAT!?

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:19.460
Hey space cadets, Trace here scoping out the
science for DNews.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:25.430
In 1610, Galileo took a telescope and pointed
it at Jupiter -- igniting a love for space

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.960
that goes far beyond simple naked-eye stargazing.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.720
The ultimate in astral gazing is the space
telescope, an imager not affected by the interference

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.820
of stuff here on earth like clouds, weather,
particulates in the atmosphere, or the light

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.320
pollution of a nearby city!

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.974
The most famous of which, The Hubble Space
Telescope just reached its 25th birthday!!

00:00:42.974 --> 00:00:43.974
(blow thing) Happy Birthday, Hubble!

00:00:43.974 --> 00:00:47.600
The HST isn't the largest one up there, but
it's versatile, capturing visible and ultraviolet

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.450
light with a bit of infrared sensing.

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:54.210
Hubble, orbits 353 miles (569 km) above Earth,
and was designed to be serviced in space by

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.720
astronauts; something no other space telescope
has done.

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.000
Which is lucky, since it famously needed to
be fixed right after it was launched.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.840
Hubble's final servicing mission in 2009 should
keep it running until 2020, but eventually

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.539
it will die -- so what then?

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:11.380
Along comes the James Webb!

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.380
The James Webb Space Telescope is Hubble's
successor.

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.799
Its mirror is 7 times larger than Hubble's
- the total surface area is the size of a

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:19.799
tennis court!

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.749
But while it's the follow-up to the HST, it's
not identical.

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:29.359
It captures mainly infrared light, because
its larger mirror is designed to look WAY

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:33.919
farther into the universe -- and the farther
things get away, the more redshifted they

00:01:33.919 --> 00:01:34.919
are.

00:01:34.919 --> 00:01:39.189
Redshifting is the tendency for the light
of distant objects to elongate -- or shift

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:41.729
toward the redder end of the light spectrum.

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.179
To look far away, we need an infrared telescope!

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:48.939
The James Webb will also be even FARTHER from
Earth -- orbiting at LaGrange point 2.

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:53.389
A LaGrange point is a spot in space where
gravity from the moon and the Earth balance

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:55.560
-- like a gravitational parking spot!

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.309
L2 is actually out PAST the moon!

00:01:58.309 --> 00:02:03.159
It's the perfect spot for a telescope -- like
Planck, which is already there.

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:06.939
See, we're only looking at a tiny part of
the picture with Webb and Hubble; infrared,

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:08.500
ultraviolet, and visible light.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.540
We've got way shorter and way longer.

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.150
Infrared is longer than visible, and microwaves
are longer than infrared!

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.560
Microwave telescopes scan the microwaves coming
out of stars, but more importantly, the bubble

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.110
of microwave radiation which exploded from
the Big Bang.

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:32.110
The European Space Agency's Planck satellite
was launched in 2009 with the goal of imaging

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:37.930
that bubble of microwave radiation which surrounds
our whole universe: called the Cosmic Microwave

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:38.930
Background radiation.

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.940
This bubble is 13.7 billion year-old energy;
and can tell us a lot about the birth of our

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:44.940
universe.

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.300
The ESA says, Planck is so advanced, it will
take measurements which cannot be improved

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.700
on with any future telescopes.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.150
But that's not all for long waves.

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:01.980
In 2011, Spektr-R was launched by Russia to
look at the last wider band of the EM spectrum,

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:02.980
radio.

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:08.109
The Spektr-R has a 10 meter (33ft) radio telescope
to observe the structure of galaxies, star

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:14.349
formations, black holes, dark matter and interstellar
space -- things we can't pick up with the

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:16.439
nearer visible spectrum.

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:20.980
Because these waves are so long, the Spektr-R
works with ground-based telescopes to pick

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.540
up as much of the radio signals as possible!

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.860
As far as shorter wave telescopes, the Chandra
X-Ray Space Observatory was launched in 1999,

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.069
and has been sucking in x-rays from the hottest
things in the galaxy.

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:34.069
Literally.

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:38.560
X-rays are absorbed by Earth's atmosphere,
so Chandra uses four angled mirrors to look

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:45.159
at x-rays from exploded stars, clusters of
galaxies, and matter around black holes while

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:46.209
in orbit.

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:50.239
Scientists are using this data to learn what
happens around supernovae and the structure

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:54.670
of the black hole at the center of our Milky
Way galaxy.

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.879
This thing is tight, but not as tight as gamma
rays.

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:03.650
The Fermi Gamma Ray telescope was launched
in 2008 to probe the upper edge of the electromagnetic

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:09.370
spectrum, looking for gamma rays, the tiniest
and most energetic of all light.

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:14.189
Gamma radiation is put out by supermassive
black-hole systems, pulsars, and often makes

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:19.910
up cosmic rays; and studying these emanations
can teach us more about physics in the universe,

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:24.150
giving rise to new theories about how everything
fits together.

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.470
Gamma waves are superfast, often zooming by
in a fraction of a second, so Fermi looks

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:33.720
at one fifth of the sky at any given moment,
so it doesn't miss a burst!

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.750
There's a reason telescopes are everywhere
on Earth and in space.

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:42.470
They're like Earth's eyes and ears out there
-- pointing at the universe.

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:43.470
It's beautiful ain't it?
