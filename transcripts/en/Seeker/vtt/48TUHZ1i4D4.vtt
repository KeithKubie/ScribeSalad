You’ve probably heard of having “mom brain.”
People use it this term to describe when things

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:09.019
slip mom’s minds - turns out, this is likely
just the result of sleep deprivation and exhaustion.

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:18.570
So, what is actually happening inside a mother’s
brain? Hi mom!

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.000
Hello sons and daughters, Lissette here for
Dnews. Many mothers report that having a child

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.490
is one of the most meaningful events they’ve
ever experienced. It’s life changing. And

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.420
from a science perspective, they’re right
- even when it comes to the structure of their

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:32.619
brains.

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.510
Mothers experience neurological changes that
start in pregnancy and continue throughout

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.710
early motherhood. In a study published in
the Journal Behavioral Neuroscience, researchers

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.629
looked at moms’ brains at 2-4 weeks after
giving birth and then again around 3 months

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.820
later. Using mri technology, they found that
mothers had increased gray matter in certain

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:57.570
areas: the parietal lobes, prefrontal cortex,
and others. Yes, their brains literally grew.

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.870
What’s more, some of the growth happened
in areas like the amygdala and hypothalamus,

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:07.759
which are associated with emotional regulation,
survival instincts and hormone production.

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:11.950
The changes here seem to be linked to mother’s
having a positive view of their babies and

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.789
an increase in positive feelings towards them
- it’s what helps moms get up 5 or 6 times

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:19.779
at night to a screaming baby without losing
any love for them.

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:24.240
In a study, researchers at The University
of Toronto Mississauga analyzed the brain

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.310
activity of 22 mothers to see if there was
anything special going in their amygdala when

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.039
mothers looked at their babies versus the
babies of strangers. What you’d expect is

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:38.469
that mothers would respond more strongly to
their own babies. And some women did - these

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:43.369
women reported higher feelings of satisfaction
with motherhood, a more positive mood, and

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:46.359
generally good experiences with being a mother.

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:50.469
Conversely, when the amygdala did not become
more sensitive during motherhood, it ended

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:55.409
up affecting the bond between mother and child
negatively. The women who had reduced amygdala

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:01.099
responses to photos of their babies reported
poorer quality of maternal experience, including

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:06.279
increased levels of stress and anxiety. Essentially,
these mothers felt they were having a hard

00:02:06.279 --> 00:02:11.680
time. We know from other studies how important
activating these brain regions can be in buffering

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.310
against negative emotions or feelings in new
mothers. In fact, postpartum depression is

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.489
associated with the binding sensitivity of
receptors in the brain that affect the amygdala

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:25.930
and other structures involved in the dopamine
reward system.

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.209
This is the same system that is activated
when we fall in love with our high school

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.780
sweetheart. In fact, studies have shown that
the same neurological processes are involved

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.069
in falling in love romantically as with falling
in love with your baby. One hormone involved

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:45.030
in this process is oxytocin - commonly dubbed
the love hormone for its role in bonding and

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.780
affection. Your body releases it when you
hug someone or cuddle - it’s when you get

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.500
that “ahhhh” feeling and everything is
ok.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.780
But it is also released
when women are giving birth, it’s associated

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.749
with breastfeeding, and it facilitates bonding
with a newborn. The hormone spikes during

00:02:59.749 --> 00:03:04.700
pregnancy and regions with high density of
receptors for oxytocin, like the amygdala,

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:10.319
are specifically activated in mothers’ brains
when responding to babies faces and scents.

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.480
In one study published in the journal Frontiers
in Psychology, researchers gave women baby

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.269
pajamas that were worn by two day old newborns.
In one group were mothers who had just given

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:23.780
birth and in the other, women who had never
had children. When the women were asked to

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.420
sniff the PJs, all women could smell the “baby
scent” to the same degree. But what was

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.719
happening in their brains, was different.
Mothers had more intense brain activity in

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:38.579
the dopamine reward system, than women had
never had children. This system is involved

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:42.950
in reward learning and its the same that makes
us crave certain foods or become addicted

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:48.280
to drugs. It motivates us to act in ways that
get us closer to the reward - in mother’s

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.290
cases, a baby. So yes, mothers can pretty
much be addicted to babies.

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.769
It’s why moms can’t stop with the kisses
- even when you’re 22. So how about you
