00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:14.119
My name's Carl Junot and I'm the head coach for Harvard Men's Soccer.  

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:15.819
And we're here on historic O'Hiri field.

00:00:15.819 --> 00:00:19.650
It's the final day of Liverpool F.C., over from Britain. 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.080
They've been training twice a day

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.500
so we've had quite a bit of interaction

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.359
and I think, from a coaching standpoint

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:30.439
it's been very educational and motivational. "It's been surreal. I'm actually seeing a lot of the players. 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:33.789
The first day I was here, Daniel Agger walked five feet behind me. You see him

00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:37.420
every Sunday in front of sixty
thousand people on the television so

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.570
it's different it's cool getting  to see him in
person." Liverpool's done

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.530
free coaching clinics for anybody in the community who was interested in coming, focusing on education,

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.709
player development,

00:00:47.709 --> 00:00:50.400
and they did it here on Harvard's campus in our
football stadium

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.900
and in our soccer stadium.  "Yeah, I've gotten to see a lot of the training sessions. Being around such

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.340
talented players is great. Also seeing the good training that the professionals have. 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.020
The excitement that they have just playing and training and winning and training is something that we

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.980
 can translate to our own game.

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.530
It's been a fantastic stay to have them here with us. Just really good for the community in

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:07.200
general

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.460
considering we're just weeks out from our
preseason

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.160
I think it's great to build some
excitement around soccer

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.010
ant

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:17.919
huh

00:01:17.919 --> 00:01:21.810
goes

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.200
Liverpool just finished their last first team training session this morning, so what 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.220
you're about to see is the Coaches' Challenge; the coaching staff from Liverpool F.C. against the coaching staff of Harvard.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.270
I've never seen Liverpool staff play but I can only guess

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:33.970
they're pretty good but

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.460
I've only seen my coaches play, but I think they're all pretty good players.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:38.490
players

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.690
Both of our assistants were high level players, Carl was a high level player, 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.290
so it should be a fun game no matter what.

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:46.630
You know, they obviously have the premier league 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.710
experience in international soccer, but I think we've got them in our sights. So it should be a good game.
