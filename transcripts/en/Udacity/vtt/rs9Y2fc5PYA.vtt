[Peter] Essentially, the problem is asking for the functionality

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
that find gives you.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
If you remember from lecture, doing text.find,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
passing in 'hoo' will give us the location

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
of the first occurrence of hoo, which is what we want.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And if hoo doesn't occur in here, we'll return -1.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
But remember, the code wants us to print it out,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
so always remember to print it.
