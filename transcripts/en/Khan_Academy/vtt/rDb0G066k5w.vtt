00:00:00.218 --> 00:00:01.295
- [Voiceover] Hello grammarians!

00:00:01.295 --> 00:00:04.221
We're talking about vowel
shifting in irregular verbs,

00:00:04.221 --> 00:00:06.070
which is gonna sound a little weird,

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:07.187
but bear with me.

00:00:07.187 --> 00:00:09.443
To review what a vowel is super quick,

00:00:09.443 --> 00:00:11.738
a vowel is any sound
that your mouth can make

00:00:11.738 --> 00:00:15.314
while your tongue isn't
touching your lips or your teeth

00:00:15.314 --> 00:00:17.549
or the roof of your mouth, basically.

00:00:17.549 --> 00:00:19.235
In English we render vowels

00:00:19.235 --> 00:00:20.962
in the following way,

00:00:20.962 --> 00:00:25.249
a, e, i, o, u, and sometimes y,

00:00:25.249 --> 00:00:28.520
or as it is commonly pronounced, aeiouy.

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.167
That part's not true,
but here is what's true

00:00:32.167 --> 00:00:34.447
is that you produce vowels

00:00:34.447 --> 00:00:37.089
from different parts of your mouth.

00:00:37.089 --> 00:00:38.917
You can produce a vowel in
the front of your mouth,

00:00:38.917 --> 00:00:40.482
you can produce it in
the center of your mouth,

00:00:40.482 --> 00:00:43.103
you can produce it all the
way back in your throat.

00:00:43.103 --> 00:00:45.277
What does this have to
do with irregular verbs?

00:00:45.277 --> 00:00:48.491
I'm so glad you asked. Let's draw a chart.

00:00:48.491 --> 00:00:51.477
So I'm gonna put three
things on this chart,

00:00:51.477 --> 00:00:54.277
the present, the past,
and the past perfect,

00:00:54.277 --> 00:00:55.598
which is when you're
talking about something

00:00:55.598 --> 00:00:57.853
in the past that is completed,

00:00:57.853 --> 00:00:59.235
and we form that in English

00:00:59.235 --> 00:01:01.774
by combining that verb with have,

00:01:01.774 --> 00:01:06.630
so have walked, have said, have done.

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.414
Now in most cases with most regular verbs,

00:01:09.414 --> 00:01:11.608
the past perfect and the past form

00:01:11.608 --> 00:01:14.046
are the same, the same thing,

00:01:14.046 --> 00:01:16.220
but in some very rare cases,

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:17.825
and that's why we're talking about these,

00:01:17.825 --> 00:01:18.800
they're different.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.405
Let's begin with the first one.

00:01:20.405 --> 00:01:23.372
In the present tense, we say "I sing."

00:01:23.372 --> 00:01:27.171
In the past tense, we
would say "she sang,"

00:01:27.171 --> 00:01:28.858
and in the past perfect, you would say

00:01:28.858 --> 00:01:31.035
"they have sung."

00:01:31.035 --> 00:01:32.372
So it's weird, right?

00:01:32.372 --> 00:01:34.059
Because the vowel changes

00:01:34.059 --> 00:01:37.045
this vowel sound, ih, ah, uh,

00:01:37.045 --> 00:01:39.748
actually bounces along your mouth.

00:01:39.748 --> 00:01:41.678
It goes from front, to middle, to back

00:01:41.678 --> 00:01:45.508
as you go further and
further back in time,

00:01:45.508 --> 00:01:47.367
which I think is really cool.

00:01:47.367 --> 00:01:48.911
Ih, uh, ah.

00:01:48.911 --> 00:01:51.044
Same thing with the word drink.

00:01:51.044 --> 00:01:52.913
In the present tense, it's I drink,

00:01:52.913 --> 00:01:54.803
in the past tense, it's I drank,

00:01:54.803 --> 00:01:57.760
and in the past perfect, it's I had drunk.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.167
There are other verbs that
follow this formula, too,

00:02:00.167 --> 00:02:03.458
like ring, rang, rung for ringing a bell,

00:02:03.458 --> 00:02:05.063
but for the rest of this,
we're just gonna talk

00:02:05.063 --> 00:02:06.343
about verbs where the past

00:02:06.343 --> 00:02:08.375
and the past perfect are the same,

00:02:08.375 --> 00:02:10.447
and there's still a vowel shift going on

00:02:10.447 --> 00:02:12.648
between the present and the past.

00:02:12.648 --> 00:02:14.795
So if you take a word like win,

00:02:14.795 --> 00:02:15.994
the present tense is win,

00:02:15.994 --> 00:02:18.432
the past tense is won,

00:02:18.432 --> 00:02:20.626
and the past perfect is also won.

00:02:20.626 --> 00:02:23.511
We had won the game. We won the game.

00:02:23.511 --> 00:02:26.153
So that vowel shift goes from ih, to uh.

00:02:26.153 --> 00:02:27.759
The verb to find.

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:29.546
So in the present tense it's find

00:02:29.546 --> 00:02:32.736
and in the past and
past perfect it's found.

00:02:32.736 --> 00:02:34.944
It goes from i-ee to ow.

00:02:35.854 --> 00:02:37.632
Sit becomes sat,

00:02:39.362 --> 00:02:42.468
sneak becomes snuck,

00:02:42.468 --> 00:02:44.804
and run becomes ran,

00:02:44.804 --> 00:02:47.080
and run is a weird one because

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.915
the past perfect form of run is run.

00:02:51.915 --> 00:02:54.760
He had run, not he had ran.

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.693
Those are some of the
front to back sound shifts

00:02:57.693 --> 00:03:02.693
it, at, uh, or it, uh, or ite, ow,

00:03:03.537 --> 00:03:06.016
that you will encounter
when you're learning

00:03:06.016 --> 00:03:07.682
irregular verbs in English.

00:03:07.682 --> 00:03:09.652
You can learn anything, David out.
