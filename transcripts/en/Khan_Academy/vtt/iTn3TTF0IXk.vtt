00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:02.707
- [Voiceover] So we're told
to factor the polynomial below

00:00:02.707 --> 00:00:07.467
by its greatest common monomial factor.

00:00:07.467 --> 00:00:08.303
So what does that mean?

00:00:08.303 --> 00:00:10.926
So we have these two terms,
and I want to figure out

00:00:10.926 --> 00:00:14.142
their greatest common monomial factor,

00:00:14.142 --> 00:00:15.662
and then I want to express this

00:00:15.662 --> 00:00:18.576
with that greatest common
monomial factor factored out.

00:00:18.576 --> 00:00:20.167
So how can we tackle it?

00:00:20.167 --> 00:00:21.119
Well, one way to start

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.229
is I can look at just the constant terms,

00:00:24.229 --> 00:00:26.766
or not the constants, the
coefficients, I should say.

00:00:26.766 --> 00:00:29.030
So I have the 8 and the 12.

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:29.472
Then I could say,

00:00:29.472 --> 00:00:32.849
"Well, what is just the greatest
common factor of 8 and 12?"

00:00:32.849 --> 00:00:36.809
The gcf of 8 and 12.

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.131
And there are a lot of
common factors of 8 and 12.

00:00:39.131 --> 00:00:42.788
They're both divisible by 1,
they're both divisible by 2,

00:00:42.788 --> 00:00:44.365
they're both divisible by 4.

00:00:44.365 --> 00:00:48.592
But the greatest of their
common factors is going to be 4.

00:00:48.592 --> 00:00:50.705
So that is equal to 4.

00:00:50.705 --> 00:00:53.445
So, let me just leave that there.

00:00:53.445 --> 00:00:54.778
And then we could think
about, "What is...?"

00:00:54.778 --> 00:00:56.496
Well, let me actually
write it right over here.

00:00:56.496 --> 00:00:57.854
I'll put a 4 here.

00:00:57.854 --> 00:01:00.872
And now we can move on to the powers of x.

00:01:00.872 --> 00:01:03.739
We have an x squared and we have an x.

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:04.274
And we could say,

00:01:04.274 --> 00:01:07.838
"What is the largest power
of x that is divisible

00:01:07.838 --> 00:01:10.671
into both x squared and x?"

00:01:10.671 --> 00:01:12.574
Well, that's just going to be x.

00:01:12.574 --> 00:01:14.838
x squared is clearly divisible by x,

00:01:14.838 --> 00:01:17.658
and x is clearly divisible by x,

00:01:17.658 --> 00:01:22.512
but x isn't going to have a
larger power of x as a factor.

00:01:22.512 --> 00:01:25.971
So this is the greatest
common monomial factor

00:01:25.971 --> 00:01:27.759
of x squared and x.

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:30.673
Now we do the same thing for the ys.

00:01:30.673 --> 00:01:33.598
So, we have a y and a y squared.

00:01:33.598 --> 00:01:34.678
If we think in the same terms

00:01:34.678 --> 00:01:37.557
the largest power of y that's
divisible into both of these

00:01:37.557 --> 00:01:40.959
is going to be just y to
the first power, or y.

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:45.010
And so 4xy is the greatest
common monomial factor.

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.576
And to see that we could
express each of these terms

00:01:47.576 --> 00:01:51.291
as a product of 4xy and something else.

00:01:51.291 --> 00:01:53.751
So this first term right over here,

00:01:53.751 --> 00:01:55.052
so let me pick a color,

00:01:55.052 --> 00:02:00.052
so this term right over
here we could write as 4xy.

00:02:00.775 --> 00:02:02.714
That one's actually,
that color's hard to see,

00:02:02.714 --> 00:02:04.908
let me pick a darker color.

00:02:04.908 --> 00:02:09.908
We could write this right
over here as 4xy times what?

00:02:12.105 --> 00:02:15.287
And I encourage you to pause
the video and think about that.

00:02:15.287 --> 00:02:19.211
Let's see, 4 times what
is going to get us to 8?

00:02:19.211 --> 00:02:21.927
Well, 4 times 2 is going to get us to 8.

00:02:21.927 --> 00:02:25.410
x times what is going
to get us to x squared?

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.427
Well, x times x is going
to get us to x squared.

00:02:28.427 --> 00:02:31.795
And then y times what
is going to get us to y?

00:02:31.795 --> 00:02:33.548
Well, it's just going to be y.

00:02:33.548 --> 00:02:36.391
So 4xy times 2x is
actually going to give us

00:02:36.391 --> 00:02:37.031
this first term.

00:02:37.031 --> 00:02:39.363
So actually just let me rewrite
a little bit differently.

00:02:39.363 --> 00:02:43.420
So it's 4xy times 2x is this first term,

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.497
and you can verify that.

00:02:45.497 --> 00:02:49.642
4 times 2 is going to be equal to 8,

00:02:49.642 --> 00:02:52.045
x times x is equal to x squared,

00:02:52.045 --> 00:02:54.147
and then you just have the y.

00:02:54.147 --> 00:02:56.887
Now let's do the same
thing with the second term.

00:02:56.887 --> 00:02:58.280
And I just want to do this to show you

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.937
that this is their largest
common monomial factor.

00:03:01.937 --> 00:03:03.458
So the second term,

00:03:03.458 --> 00:03:05.545
and I'll do this in a
slightly different color,

00:03:05.545 --> 00:03:07.235
do it in blue.

00:03:07.235 --> 00:03:11.657
I want to write this as the product of 4xy

00:03:11.657 --> 00:03:15.478
and another monomial.

00:03:15.478 --> 00:03:17.509
So 4 times what is 12?

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:19.934
Well, 4 times 3 is 12.

00:03:19.934 --> 00:03:21.514
x times what is x?

00:03:21.514 --> 00:03:22.617
Well, it's just going to be 1,

00:03:22.617 --> 00:03:24.649
so we don't have to write a times 1 here.

00:03:24.649 --> 00:03:26.808
And then y times what is y squared?

00:03:26.808 --> 00:03:29.815
It's going to be y times y is y squared.

00:03:29.815 --> 00:03:30.558
And you can verify.

00:03:30.558 --> 00:03:34.412
If you multiply these two you're
going to get 12 xy-squared.

00:03:34.412 --> 00:03:36.792
4 times 3 is 12, you get your x,

00:03:36.792 --> 00:03:39.392
and then y times y is y squared.

00:03:39.392 --> 00:03:42.771
So, so far I've written
this exact same expression

00:03:42.771 --> 00:03:45.254
but I've taken each of those
terms and I've factored them

00:03:45.254 --> 00:03:49.433
into their greatest common monomial factor

00:03:49.433 --> 00:03:51.408
and then whatever is left over.

00:03:51.408 --> 00:03:55.052
And now I can factor the 4xy out.

00:03:55.052 --> 00:03:56.934
I can actually factor it out.

00:03:56.934 --> 00:03:58.907
So this is going to be equal to,

00:03:58.907 --> 00:04:02.866
if I factor the 4xys out,

00:04:02.866 --> 00:04:05.907
you can kind of say I
undistribute the 4xy.

00:04:05.907 --> 00:04:07.347
I factor it out.

00:04:07.347 --> 00:04:12.347
This is going to be equal
to 4xy times 2x plus --

00:04:20.906 --> 00:04:25.330
when I factor 4xy from here
I get the 3y left over.

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.230
Plus 3y, and we're done.

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:30.066
And you can verify it.

00:04:30.066 --> 00:04:31.645
If you were to go the other way,

00:04:31.645 --> 00:04:33.223
if you were to distribute this 4xy

00:04:33.223 --> 00:04:36.405
and multiply it times 2x,
you would get 8 x-squared y.

00:04:36.405 --> 00:04:39.167
And then when you distribute
the 4xy onto the 3y

00:04:39.167 --> 00:04:41.431
you get the 12xy-squared.

00:04:41.431 --> 00:04:42.453
And so we're done.

00:04:42.453 --> 00:04:44.530
This right over here is our answer.

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:48.931
The answer is going to be 4xy,

00:04:48.931 --> 00:04:51.462
which is the greatest
common monomial factor,

00:04:51.462 --> 00:04:56.462
times 2x plus 3y.
