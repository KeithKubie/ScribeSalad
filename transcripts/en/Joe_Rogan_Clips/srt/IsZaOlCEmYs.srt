1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:04,000
The Joe Rogan experience
mean easy to live with.

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:08,200
But it's interesting that this
is like this game of like, okay,

3
00:00:08,201 --> 00:00:12,250
let's look at watches. There's no real
improvement in performance, right?

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,630
I mean they're beautiful and,

5
00:00:13,631 --> 00:00:17,530
but I mean the performance difference
between now and 10 years ago is not clear.

6
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:21,880
Yeah. In a mechanical watch.
No, I mean it's their watch.

7
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:26,170
There's artistry and there's
technological complication. I mean it's,

8
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,200
there's complication for
the sake of complications.

9
00:00:30,201 --> 00:00:34,060
So they'll have watches
like to use a car example,

10
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:37,630
imagine a car. Okay.

11
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:41,140
And from the outside it looks roughly
like a normal car, right? Four,

12
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:43,420
four wheels on the driver's seat, right?

13
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:49,020
It has one engine and it has four
transmissions coming off of that engine,

14
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:53,500
all of which come back
together to make it the car.

15
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:57,760
One wheel drive. [inaudible] right.

16
00:00:57,940 --> 00:00:59,860
Imagine that applied to a watch.

17
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:05,250
So it'll be like one main movement that
goes out into four gear trains and then

18
00:01:06,701 --> 00:01:09,790
comes back into just an hour
and a minute hand. Well,

19
00:01:09,791 --> 00:01:14,590
why would you sync up for gear trains
when you could do the same thing with one?

20
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:16,480
And it's like, well, because we can,

21
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:20,350
it would be like building a car with
two engines. Like that's not smart,

22
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:24,400
but you do it just be like, Hey, I
built a fucking car with two engine Les,

23
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:26,180
you're talking about
like the NSX engine. We,

24
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:29,260
you're the front engine for
the electric. Exactly. Exactly.

25
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:34,420
But I think what I'm getting at is
that with computers and with cars,

26
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:37,840
those are the one thing that you
expect an improvement every year. Yeah.

27
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:40,450
Just that nobody's going
to accept the old way.

28
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:44,140
Like you can't just build unless you're
singer and you making something custom.

29
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:48,070
Well that's that the singer
is what that example is,

30
00:01:48,071 --> 00:01:53,050
what the mechanical watch
kind of industry is. You know,

31
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:53,341
they,

32
00:01:53,341 --> 00:01:58,341
they position it as a luxury item
from a time gone by sort of thing.

33
00:01:59,081 --> 00:02:01,450
You know? Whereas actually if you
want to talk about innovation,

34
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,790
this right here is a grand Seiko,

35
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:07,120
which has a movement called a
spring drive movement in it.

36
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:12,480
And it is one of the most advanced and
unique mechanical movements available in

37
00:02:12,851 --> 00:02:16,360
a watch today. So this is a Seiko,
it's a grand Seiko, which is,

38
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:20,920
so the difference is uh, it's
like, think about a Lexus.

39
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:25,660
Think about Alexis. A Seiko
is a Lexus, not a Toyota.

40
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,820
This is a Lexus LFA.

41
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:33,070
This is a grand Seiko is built in a
different factory from the regular Seikos.

42
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,930
It's built by hand, completely by
hand, all hand finished, hand polished.

43
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:42,400
It's built of exotic materials.
It has a cool movement. Dude.

44
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,940
You should sell watches or watch
podcasts, but watching, listen,

45
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,140
it's on YouTube,

46
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:51,310
but you see I have what is
called the display back on this.

47
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:56,310
So you can see the movement in the back
and how high the level of finishes.

48
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:00,880
And you've got Sapphire, titanium and um,

49
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:05,950
so the spring drive movement is without
getting crazy crazy nerdy about it. Is,

50
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:10,960
is actually a true innovation
in mechanical watchmaking.
So run the chronograph,

51
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,200
it's on the front. The top
button not here at you watch the,

52
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:17,170
the sweep of the chronograph
hand, the big second hand,

53
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:20,260
you get a perfectly smooth sweep.

54
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:25,180
The smoothest possible sweep that
there could be. It is, it is,

55
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:28,930
it is, it is. How much does
the watch like this worth?

56
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,460
Around 10,000 yeah. Mazing yeah. God.

57
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,220
But it's watch $300.

58
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:40,360
Well that's cause you know G shocks
are the shit dude. 300 bucks.

59
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:44,170
G shocks are awesome as far as like
I'm a light. No, but it hasn't,

60
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:47,320
but it's polished so that it can see
it in the dark date. Motherfucker.

61
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,690
Look dude, G shocks are dope.

62
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:55,150
A G shock is a watch guys tool
watch like highly functional,

63
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:59,110
durable. Um, a G shock is
a total watch. Guys watch,

64
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:03,550
you can get G shocks that are like $5,000.
You know what? Yeah, they have dude,

65
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:07,810
Jamie look up a $5,000 G shock. That's
um, that right there. Hold that up.

66
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,050
That's Sean Warren Ward's
own design. That's cool.

67
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:13,900
It's amazing as I think it's
based on the Duesberg. Yeah.

68
00:04:13,901 --> 00:04:17,680
Duesenberg gauge cluster. The
watch is called the doozy and it's,

69
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,850
it's got a complication on it
called the jump. Our complication.

70
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,230
So the,

71
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:27,310
it's a basically just a black face almost
looks like a bathroom scale and it's

72
00:04:27,311 --> 00:04:32,311
got two windows hours on top minutes
on the bottom and the minutes sweep by

73
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,580
slowly.

74
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:38,970
Whereas the hours do not suite
by slowly at 59 and 59 seconds.

75
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:41,080
The hours click over right fast.

76
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:45,790
So it's a jump power as
opposed to a slow moving hour.

77
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:49,200
Now he designed the look or
did he design the internals?

78
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:51,790
He designed the look, the face,

79
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:56,880
the complications and he worked with a
Swiss watch maker to design an actual

80
00:04:57,791 --> 00:05:02,470
unique movement to use for this watch.
He designed the case and that's crazy.

81
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:06,580
It is awesome. And that watch is
12 grand. I was making 50 of them.

82
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:11,080
I believe it. He tried to use the
face in that a Vantaa black shit.

83
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,050
What does that Phantom
black is the darkest,

84
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,810
the blackest black that
has ever existed. Oh,

85
00:05:16,811 --> 00:05:21,040
I saw they painted a building with it.
It looks like a negative space, dude.

86
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:22,180
Get a picture of to black.

87
00:05:22,181 --> 00:05:26,800
It doesn't look real and it's
the most black that that,

88
00:05:26,801 --> 00:05:29,650
that that's something painted
in Vantaa black. Whoa.

89
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,100
It's so black that it absorbs all
light and you can't even wait.

90
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:38,260
Can you paint a car in that you could
accept in the environmentally? It's not.

91
00:05:38,261 --> 00:05:41,860
It's not a good thing.
Fuck the penguins. Oh,

92
00:05:41,861 --> 00:05:45,730
whoever's going to die
apparently to me black G wagon.

93
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:50,940
Oh fucks bro. I need
my G wagon. [inaudible]

94
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:56,320
has the Vantaa has Vantaa black
and of course it does and it's,

95
00:05:56,321 --> 00:06:01,321
you'll see it's $95,000 and the Vantaa
black is just the black background.

96
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:04,700
When you said $95,000 my balls hurt.

97
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,970
Me and my balls go like
this. They went, bro.

98
00:06:07,971 --> 00:06:11,480
They got watches that are $1
million. There's $1 million.

99
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:15,200
You can buy $1 million watches
right now. 300 bucks. G shock dude.

100
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:20,290
There's a watch called the Jacob astronomy
that is like wearing like a Sapphire

101
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:26,000
fishbowl on your fucking hand. I swear.
It's the craziest shit you've ever seen.

102
00:06:26,001 --> 00:06:30,740
It's so ridiculous. It's
like Liberace. The oil sheet,

103
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,350
Zay and Jamie top right picture
there. See this as a gold case.

104
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:41,360
That's a Sapphire case. The whole
thing. What if you bump into something,

105
00:06:41,361 --> 00:06:45,920
it's shattered on your hands. That's
so stupid. Well, glass was not glass.

106
00:06:45,921 --> 00:06:47,810
It's Sapphire Cinderella motherfucker.

107
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,110
The whole case is milled
from a block of Sapphire.

108
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:55,110
The whole case can go fuck
itself. Seriously. It's $1 million

109
00:06:56,690 --> 00:07:01,250
you deserve. You deserve that thing
to break. That's crazy looking.

110
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,320
It's hilarious, right? That's $1
million watch. Earth is the earth. The,

111
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:06,830
the planets are spinning around,

112
00:07:06,831 --> 00:07:10,940
spin around and you can find a video of
it moving. It's nuts. Look at the stars.

113
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:13,700
Oh, it's kinda like a roll of
you drove your rolls Royce.

114
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,920
It would match our watch.
You'd be like, Whoa, Whoa.

115
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:19,970
You could coordinate this guy
with your star field ceiling dude.

116
00:07:19,971 --> 00:07:23,280
That is a small earth.
That's crazy. And it's,

117
00:07:23,281 --> 00:07:28,281
it literally has the continents and
silver and then some blue star thing.

118
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:32,240
What is the water made out of?
You think it's gotta be like,

119
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:37,430
I so idea anodized something,
but then there's a diamond,

120
00:07:37,431 --> 00:07:39,740
a son on the other side of my God,

121
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:43,550
there's a ball at diamond ball that
spins or some of them have different,

122
00:07:43,551 --> 00:07:45,200
different, uh, stuff on them too,

123
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:48,830
that that's just one ball or you have
to be to be sporting $1 million water.

124
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:51,080
That one's got up, that
one's got a central,

125
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:55,730
let me check the time on my million
dollar mother fucking watch. It's crazy.

126
00:07:55,731 --> 00:07:59,210
Right? That's crazy. There's some
rich people doing some really,

127
00:07:59,211 --> 00:08:02,750
really weird rich people things
right now. That seems preposterous.

128
00:08:02,751 --> 00:08:06,560
That thing with all the diamonds in the
bucket diamonds, that's like some steam,

129
00:08:06,561 --> 00:08:11,170
punk, futuristic, but like, it's weird.

130
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:16,010
Even more so than you know, cars. It's
like, cause a car, it's like, okay,

131
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:19,100
you got a thousand dollar car
cut $10,000 car, $100,000 Carmen.

132
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,670
Like when you use the
zoom in really close,

133
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,220
that's the computer version
because that's not, Oh, it's CGI,

134
00:08:25,221 --> 00:08:29,450
but that is pretty much what you get
astrological signs there. Oh my God.

135
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:34,220
What is that the red made out of?
That's like Amber something. Oh,

136
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:37,280
probably Ruby. The sons a
Ruby. It's probably Ruby.

137
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:40,310
The sun's probably a yellow diamond

138
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:46,880
mother fucker. That is incredible.
I don't get it, but I get it.

139
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:47,990
I know you must've.

140
00:08:47,991 --> 00:08:52,310
I'm able to appreciate that someone is
making a machine that fits in a little

141
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:55,950
fishbowl on your wrist. Look
at that it again and look.

142
00:08:55,951 --> 00:09:00,210
I mean look on top of the crazy artistry
of this and the ridiculous price and

143
00:09:00,211 --> 00:09:04,200
the jewels and all that stuff. The
mathematics of that machine work.

144
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:07,290
That is not, that's not
just like that for nothing.

145
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:09,390
That does like moon phase.

146
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:12,600
You know the what sat
astrological sign. It is.

147
00:09:12,601 --> 00:09:16,650
There is an actual function. Look at
that one with the dredge dragon in it.

148
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,210
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

149
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:21,570
It looks like something to come out of
a little kid's gumball. It's so crazy.

150
00:09:21,571 --> 00:09:23,970
Right? Go scroll up.
That's amazing. Looking.

151
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:27,510
Scroll up to the other images though that
they had those three watches together.

152
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:31,830
Look at you ever. Look how good
those things look. I mean, that is,

153
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:35,460
that is a crazy thing to have on
your arm. It's so crazy, right?

154
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:39,420
But that's $1 million. And if you see
someone wearing one in person, it's,

155
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:42,570
it's big. It's, it's like,
it's like the size of,

156
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:46,380
you know that that Ganny lid
coffee mug in your hands.

157
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:52,140
It's so big. There's really,
people are there actually,

158
00:09:52,141 --> 00:09:56,490
I mean you'd be shocked at what
people are doing with certain,

159
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:00,060
with machinery and watt and mechanical
watchmaker wouldn't be mercies.

160
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:02,970
It's like the fight against
friction is the whole thing, right?

161
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:06,840
You've got this tiny little spring and
you need to get as much power out of it

162
00:10:06,841 --> 00:10:07,381
as possible.

163
00:10:07,381 --> 00:10:12,381
So they engineer these like micro
grams of friction out of this stuff.

164
00:10:12,601 --> 00:10:17,120
So they they let's not ER work
the fuck is that star Trek?

165
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:22,680
Yeah. And uh, Whoa. That's pretty, yeah,
I think it was the lid liquids closed.

166
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:25,080
It looks like an egg
star Trek communicator.

167
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,260
Now how much does something like that go
for, let's call it 50 or 60 Oh, sorry.

168
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:30,450
I was going to, yes, I
was going to get higher.

169
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:33,720
I was going to get 75 I think you can
get different versions of it that are,

170
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:37,800
don't hold me to the price.
It's expensive, but what
do you think it cost Jamie?

171
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,800
Take 75 yeah, that's what I was saying.

172
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,130
75 let's top the top
article should have it.

173
00:10:44,131 --> 00:10:45,870
The hoe dinky article
usually has the price.

174
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:48,210
If you scroll down to the bottom
of that article, it should have it.

175
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:52,050
That's it closed right there. So you
can read the time when it's closed.

176
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:57,680
So that on that watch
it's eight 27 Oh yeah.

177
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:01,650
And what does it look like when it's
closed? Go, go up. That's close, right?

178
00:11:01,651 --> 00:11:06,450
That's closed. Yeah. And then that's
another version of different tops. Yeah,

179
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:09,570
the clear top or the
the or the metallic one.

180
00:11:09,571 --> 00:11:12,630
And then there's a carbon back
and that's a pretty watch. Yeah,

181
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:16,590
it's pretty looking. If you scroll all
the way down, it should say the price.

182
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:21,120
No, 68,000 there you
go. Fucking expensive.

183
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,220
It's, there's some wild stuff. There's
a company called H, Y. T that is,

184
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:30,030
that makes watches that have a liquid
that moves around and it tells you the

185
00:11:30,031 --> 00:11:34,080
time based on like almost
like a thermometer. The
liquid goes up to this level.

186
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:37,590
There's a watched by a company
called Devin, D. E. V. O. N.

187
00:11:37,591 --> 00:11:41,820
it's a belt driven watch where you have
like a series of conveyor belts on your

188
00:11:41,821 --> 00:11:44,460
wrist. There's the HYC. So the green,

189
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,180
the green liquid goes around the dial.

190
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:51,300
Ah, yeah.

191
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:56,050
It's like a nuclear ooze that
like flows through the dial. Yeah.

192
00:11:56,590 --> 00:12:00,970
So it, it changes depending upon
the time. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So that,

193
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:02,800
that GU like it flows.

194
00:12:02,801 --> 00:12:05,530
Go back to the one with the
green goo on the top left there.

195
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:11,250
So all my light fills up around the dial
and then it is when it goes all the way

196
00:12:11,801 --> 00:12:15,520
around. Is it a minute? Ain't no,
it's an hour. That belief. Amazing.

197
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,350
It's awesome. Right? That's amazing.

198
00:12:17,351 --> 00:12:19,630
You looked down and that's how
you know where it is in the hour.

199
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:23,470
And then it had a, it had a typical
hour hand. Yeah. And then this one,

200
00:12:23,471 --> 00:12:26,410
it flows around the skull. Dude.

201
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:29,680
This something like that costs a
hundred grand or something. Geez.

202
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:33,400
Actual Rose is actually sponsored by
them. Believe it or not. It works. Right?

203
00:12:33,401 --> 00:12:35,830
It's on brand for him. I think
this is about a hundred grand.

204
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:39,190
So when you say sponsored, like
what do they do to get axle to wear?

205
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:43,830
He wears one. Yeah. I follow these
dumb watch spotter Instagram accounts.

206
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:49,390
They sell for upwards of 50,000 so I
think it's more than that. But yeah,

207
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:54,310
50 or 75 yeah, they're expensive man.
It's David Cross selling watches.

208
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:57,670
285,000 days.

209
00:12:57,671 --> 00:13:02,350
Three particular ultra light
high-end model. Which one's that one?

210
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,890
But it's there's, you know, there's
some materials in this stuff there.

211
00:13:05,891 --> 00:13:08,990
They use crazy forged carbon there.

212
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:13,990
Well I'm 95 grand used for a skull
one. Yep. Ooh, let me see that.

213
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:19,180
That's pretty, Oh bear real crazy. I mean
it's, you can get lost in this stuff.

214
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:22,640
I mean the machinery of it and
the materials. Do you think the,

215
00:13:22,641 --> 00:13:24,760
the liquid is that goes
around that fuck? I dunno.

216
00:13:24,761 --> 00:13:26,920
They may have a different
picture with a different liquid.

217
00:13:26,921 --> 00:13:30,250
So that's how the minutes go.
Yeah. And then there was an allies,

218
00:13:30,251 --> 00:13:33,400
so crazy the press that, let's see,

219
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,990
here's the liquors, the liquid going

220
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:44,470
so cool. That is fucking dope. I just,

221
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:46,630
I love the fact that
people are so creative,

222
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:51,250
they can figure out how to do things
like this on something like a watch.

223
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:55,030
So you look at the look of the red
dude going around the skull. Ah,

224
00:13:55,031 --> 00:13:59,650
isn't that awesome? Oh my God.
I'm in love with it. It's so cool.

225
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:04,360
It's amazing. I'm in love with this. And
then look, it goes back, it goes back,

226
00:14:04,361 --> 00:14:08,580
but it goes back quick. It goes
back quick and resets. Oh wow. Yeah.

227
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:12,010
Eyes fill up when it goes
back. Oh, you gotta be kidding.

228
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,280
Oh my God. That's some really next level.

229
00:14:15,281 --> 00:14:19,780
Like there's bellows and pumps and it's
like pumping like liquid around dude.

230
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:23,530
Right. I had no idea. Yeah, I know.
I did. People were doing this dude.

231
00:14:23,531 --> 00:14:27,730
People are doing crazy
things that is fucking bad.

232
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,040
Like on a more, so that's
really crazy. It's like,

233
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:32,950
so I have a watch that is
called the perpetual calendar,

234
00:14:32,951 --> 00:14:37,180
which is like a traditional complicated
watch. So it does day of the week,

235
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:40,390
date of the month, month of the year,

236
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:44,830
four digit year moon phase. Power reserve.

237
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:50,320
Okay. And the time obviously, and
it has all of those functions.

238
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:54,070
And if you, if you keep the watch
running, you know it's mechanical,

239
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:56,650
you've got to keep it wound up.
If you keep it wound and running,

240
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:59,290
it will be accurate for all of us.
