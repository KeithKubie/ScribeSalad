Hey, it's me Destin

00:00:01.332 --> 00:00:04.533
We got a lot of rain her in Alabama over the last couple of weeks

00:00:04.533 --> 00:00:08.891
and i wanted to show you an interesting survival technique i've found in one of the local species.

00:00:08.891 --> 00:00:13.485
Anyway, you can see all the area behind me used to be wide open grassy field

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:14.320
but right now.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:16.080
It's nothing but water

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.679
So in order to show you what I want to show you, we're going to have to get in the truck

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:20.864
and drive through the water.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.120
So let's do that now.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:35.260
[Engine noises, water splashing]

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:36.860
Okay, so...

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.140
I found a pretty shallow spot where I could show you this, but you can see

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.060
What's normally a field has been covered with water

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.240
But in one particular location

00:00:47.651 --> 00:00:52.111
We see this clump of this floating stuff and it's hard to tell what it is.

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:57.260
But this dark spot that you see in front of me is actually a bunch of living organisms

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.610
striving to stay alive.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.320
They're fighting desperately, actually.

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.000
I'll give you a closer look

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.640
What you're looking at

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.320
is what used to be a colony of ants that would live in the ground.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.840
Here you can see they've clumped up into a raft

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.220
with some of them on the bottom

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.840
helping the other ones on top float. They've

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.800
grabbed on to some grass to try and anchor off and try to get more of them above water.

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.160
But if you look real close you can see

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.060
it's literally a living raft.

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.980
Very interesting survival technique I would say.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:35.880
You can see they're even carrying their larvae.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.105
After a little investigation, I found out that right under the top layer

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.860
That's where... all the larvae are kept.

00:01:46.681 --> 00:01:48.201
You see? All the white?

00:01:48.672 --> 00:01:49.872
Just under there!

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.740
You can see they're scrambling to let all the, uh...

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.340
the larvae be on top first

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.000
then they encase them with their bodies.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.660
If you notice the ones on bottom, such as right here

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.100
These little guys... aren't moving.

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:14.560
Maybe a little grass. Other than that, pure biomass!
