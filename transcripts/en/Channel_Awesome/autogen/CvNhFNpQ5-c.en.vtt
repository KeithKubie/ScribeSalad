protecting these giant simulations I was
in a simulation once life is a

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720
in a simulation once life is a
 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.180
in a simulation once life is a
simulation think about that and so it's

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190
simulation think about that and so it's
 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:02.980
simulation think about that and so it's
all building up to the great big grey

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:02.990
all building up to the great big grey
 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:04.690
all building up to the great big grey
simulation before he goes and does the

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700
simulation before he goes and does the
 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.280
simulation before he goes and does the
real thing though he goes into the

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290
real thing though he goes into the
 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.320
real thing though he goes into the
simulation and fights off all the aliens

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330
simulation and fights off all the aliens
 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.000
simulation and fights off all the aliens
with all the grown-ups watching and

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010
with all the grown-ups watching and
 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:11.290
with all the grown-ups watching and
their asshole seem particularly tight

their asshole seem particularly tight
 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.120
their asshole seem particularly tight
for some reason and in the simulation he

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130
for some reason and in the simulation he
 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.970
for some reason and in the simulation he
blows up the alien planet hurry but it

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980
blows up the alien planet hurry but it
 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.380
blows up the alien planet hurry but it
turns out was no simulation at all it

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390
turns out was no simulation at all it
 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.190
turns out was no simulation at all it
was the real thing hey wait stop yeah

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200
was the real thing hey wait stop yeah
 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.480
was the real thing hey wait stop yeah
but ender feels bad cuz he's not sure if

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:22.490
but ender feels bad cuz he's not sure if
 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:24.450
but ender feels bad cuz he's not sure if
he did for the right reason Hey

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:24.460
he did for the right reason Hey
 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:27.010
he did for the right reason Hey
okay hurry but in here Jones is like

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:27.020
okay hurry but in here Jones is like
 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:29.020
okay hurry but in here Jones is like
