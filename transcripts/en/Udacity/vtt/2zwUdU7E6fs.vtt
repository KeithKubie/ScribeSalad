Although jelly beans are in fact quite delicious,

00:00:04.018 --> 00:00:08.490
oh, cinnamon's my favorite, they don't actually have any

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.328
cells inside, so there's no DNA for us

00:00:11.328 --> 00:00:14.490
to extract. Now, our cooked meat over here, our

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.010
ground turkey does have self DNA, but once

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.300
it's cooked, we've really digested and broken up all

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.100
that DNA and protein that existed in the cells,

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.493
so it's really hard to get. Plus, we have

00:00:25.493 --> 00:00:28.092
to kill a turkey to get it, which isn't really worth it.

00:00:28.092 --> 00:00:28.602
[SOUND]

00:00:28.602 --> 00:00:34.824
However, our raw fruit, like strawberries over here, these guys have

00:00:34.824 --> 00:00:40.610
live cells in them and they're chock-full of DNA. And they're pretty delicious.
