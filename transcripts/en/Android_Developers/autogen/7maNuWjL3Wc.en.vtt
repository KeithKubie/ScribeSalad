immediately giving up on you they're
 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:00.970

this is a death warrant and you don't

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709
this is a death warrant and you don't
 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:09.069
this is a death warrant and you don't
want to see this but the thing is that's

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:09.079
want to see this but the thing is that's
 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:11.020
want to see this but the thing is that's
what users see what it actually means is

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030
what users see what it actually means is
 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:12.670
what users see what it actually means is
that your app is working really hard and

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680
that your app is working really hard and
 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.440
that your app is working really hard and
it just needs a minute and that's what's

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450
it just needs a minute and that's what's
 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:15.970
it just needs a minute and that's what's
really frustrating because the developer

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980
really frustrating because the developer
 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.159
really frustrating because the developer
perspective here is that you know you're

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:18.169
perspective here is that you know you're
 

00:03:18.169 --> 00:03:19.390
perspective here is that you know you're
you're trying to do work and you just

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400
you're trying to do work and you just
 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.619
you're trying to do work and you just
forgot something but the user

00:03:20.619 --> 00:03:20.629
forgot something but the user
 

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:21.940
forgot something but the user
perspective is you're the worst ever and

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950
perspective is you're the worst ever and
 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.180

I hate you so we're gonna move on and

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190
I hate you so we're gonna move on and
 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:26.379
I hate you so we're gonna move on and
we're going to avoid this by moving

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:26.389
we're going to avoid this by moving
 

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:28.360
we're going to avoid this by moving
something off the main thread work

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370
something off the main thread work
 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:29.469
something off the main thread work
that's gonna hang it's gonna make us

00:03:29.469 --> 00:03:29.479
that's gonna hang it's gonna make us
 

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:30.819
that's gonna hang it's gonna make us
miss our framerate and we don't want to

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:30.829
miss our framerate and we don't want to
 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:32.140
miss our framerate and we don't want to
do that so we're gonna just shift it

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150
do that so we're gonna just shift it
 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:33.729
do that so we're gonna just shift it
away and then it can resync with the

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739
away and then it can resync with the
 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:34.780
away and then it can resync with the
later activity when it's time to

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790
later activity when it's time to
 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:36.550
later activity when it's time to
actually update it instead of trying to

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560
actually update it instead of trying to
 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.619
actually update it instead of trying to
like pause the current activity and wait

00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:38.629
like pause the current activity and wait
 

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:42.250
like pause the current activity and wait
for it okay so that's our goal so we

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260
for it okay so that's our goal so we
 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:43.330
for it okay so that's our goal so we
don't want to miss our framerate because

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340
don't want to miss our framerate because
 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:44.740
don't want to miss our framerate because
we missed that Colt McAnlis will just

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750
we missed that Colt McAnlis will just
 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.069
we missed that Colt McAnlis will just
magically appear and start hating on you

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:47.079
magically appear and start hating on you
 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:49.479
magically appear and start hating on you
so the question is where do we start

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:49.489
so the question is where do we start
 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:51.580
so the question is where do we start

you're probably thinking oh good a sync

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970
you're probably thinking oh good a sync
 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.530
you're probably thinking oh good a sync
task and that's not correct an async

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540
task and that's not correct an async
 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.089
task and that's not correct an async
task is actually tied to your activity

00:03:58.089 --> 00:03:58.099
task is actually tied to your activity
 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:00.399
task is actually tied to your activity
lifecycle and that can be I can have its

00:04:00.399 --> 00:04:00.409
lifecycle and that can be I can have its
 

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:01.780
lifecycle and that can be I can have its
own advantages and disadvantages

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790
own advantages and disadvantages
 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.539
own advantages and disadvantages
so I'm going to focus on work that is

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:04.549
so I'm going to focus on work that is
 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:06.250
so I'm going to focus on work that is
entirely off the main thread and async

tasks like has its place and you can you

00:04:07.839 --> 00:04:07.849
tasks like has its place and you can you
 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:09.429
tasks like has its place and you can you
know read all about it on your own so

00:04:09.429 --> 00:04:09.439
know read all about it on your own so
 

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:12.189
know read all about it on your own so
let's start with services

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:12.199
let's start with services
 

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:15.749
let's start with services
what's a service well its complex

00:04:15.749 --> 00:04:15.759
what's a service well its complex
 

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:18.129
what's a service well its complex
they're hard they have a lot of pieces

00:04:18.129 --> 00:04:18.139
they're hard they have a lot of pieces
 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:20.680
they're hard they have a lot of pieces
you have to manage services run in the

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:20.690
you have to manage services run in the
 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:22.420
you have to manage services run in the
background they're fully apart from any

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430
background they're fully apart from any
 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.370
background they're fully apart from any
app activity or fragment but that means

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380
app activity or fragment but that means
 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.320
app activity or fragment but that means
that it can keep running even when your

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330
that it can keep running even when your
 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.209
that it can keep running even when your
app isn't which is actually pretty

00:04:28.209 --> 00:04:28.219
app isn't which is actually pretty
 

00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:30.810
app isn't which is actually pretty
fantastic but because of this button

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:30.820
fantastic but because of this button
 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.990
fantastic but because of this button
but services can't affect your UI so you

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000
but services can't affect your UI so you
 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.980
but services can't affect your UI so you
know if you actually want to show a

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990
know if you actually want to show a
 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:36.330
know if you actually want to show a
progress dialog because what you're

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340
progress dialog because what you're
 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:37.680
progress dialog because what you're
doing is in the response to a user

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690
doing is in the response to a user
 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:39.690
doing is in the response to a user
initiated action you probably do want

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:39.700
initiated action you probably do want
 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:40.890
initiated action you probably do want
your async task but that's a really

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:40.900
your async task but that's a really
 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.720
your async task but that's a really
great way to do it but if you're kicking

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:42.730
great way to do it but if you're kicking
 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:43.770
great way to do it but if you're kicking
off some sort of activity that only

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780
off some sort of activity that only
 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.240
off some sort of activity that only
needs to report back when it's done and

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250
needs to report back when it's done and
 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:46.980
needs to report back when it's done and
like maybe update the UI then like a

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990
like maybe update the UI then like a
 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:48.510

service is going to be great because it

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520
service is going to be great because it
 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.070
service is going to be great because it
can send that information back like

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080
can send that information back like
 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.960
can send that information back like
through other avenues later on but yeah

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:51.970
through other avenues later on but yeah
 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:53.250
through other avenues later on but yeah
you can't update the UI while you're in

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:53.260
you can't update the UI while you're in
 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.080
you can't update the UI while you're in
a service so when your results seep to

a service so when your results seep to
 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:57.570
a service so when your results seep to
pass it services are great for things

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580
pass it services are great for things

but that doesn't have to happen exactly
 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:07.560
but that doesn't have to happen exactly
at that moment that could happen when

at that moment that could happen when
 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:09.780

that services have to manage their own

that services have to manage their own
life cycle and that can be kind of

life cycle and that can be kind of
 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.410
life cycle and that can be kind of
intimidating because you have to first

intimidating because you have to first
 

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:23.880
intimidating because you have to first
figure out which methods to override and

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:23.890
figure out which methods to override and
 

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:25.320
figure out which methods to override and
then how to override them and then what

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:25.330
then how to override them and then what

you want to leave alone and then how you
 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:28.230
you want to leave alone and then how you
call it and then that's just a lot which

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240
call it and then that's just a lot which
 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.090
call it and then that's just a lot which
goes back to my point that services are

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:30.100
goes back to my point that services are
 

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:33.090
goes back to my point that services are
complex so that's why we're gonna talk

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:33.100
complex so that's why we're gonna talk
 

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:35.850
complex so that's why we're gonna talk
about intent service which does all this

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:35.860
about intent service which does all this
 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:38.700
about intent service which does all this
work for you like how nice is that

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:38.710
work for you like how nice is that
 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:41.250
work for you like how nice is that
so an instant service isn't much easier

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:41.260
so an instant service isn't much easier
 

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:42.900
so an instant service isn't much easier
implementation because it will handle

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:42.910
implementation because it will handle
 

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:44.970
implementation because it will handle
all of its own life cycle you don't have

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:44.980
all of its own life cycle you don't have
 

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:46.620
all of its own life cycle you don't have
to worry about starting it or binding it

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:46.630
to worry about starting it or binding it
 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:48.150
to worry about starting it or binding it
or letting it go or just trying it like

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:48.160
or letting it go or just trying it like
 

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:49.890
or letting it go or just trying it like
it's it does all of that for you it's

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:49.900
it's it does all of that for you it's
 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:51.540
it's it does all of that for you it's
already written you can focus on what

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:51.550
already written you can focus on what
 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:52.950
already written you can focus on what
matters and that's the background work

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:52.960
matters and that's the background work
 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.690
matters and that's the background work
and not how you get into or out of your

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:54.700
and not how you get into or out of your
 

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:56.880
and not how you get into or out of your
background tasks the trade-off here with

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:56.890
background tasks the trade-off here with
 

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:57.900
background tasks the trade-off here with
an intent service and something other

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:57.910
an intent service and something other
 

00:05:57.910 --> 00:05:59.400
an intent service and something other
one is that an intent service can only

00:05:59.400 --> 00:05:59.410
one is that an intent service can only
 

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:01.260
one is that an intent service can only
handle one thing at a time all requests

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:01.270
handle one thing at a time all requests
 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:03.060
handle one thing at a time all requests
will happen sequentially so if your app

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:03.070
will happen sequentially so if your app
 

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:04.740
will happen sequentially so if your app
is designed with multiple requests that

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:04.750
is designed with multiple requests that
 

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:05.940
is designed with multiple requests that
might come in and all need to exit at

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:05.950
might come in and all need to exit at
 

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:07.410
might come in and all need to exit at
the same time you're gonna have to read

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:07.420
the same time you're gonna have to read
 

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:08.580
the same time you're gonna have to read
the documentation on how services work

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:08.590
the documentation on how services work
 

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:12.960
the documentation on how services work
sorry okay so how do we create an intent

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:12.970
sorry okay so how do we create an intent
 

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:14.760
sorry okay so how do we create an intent
service first step is you know you have

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:14.770
service first step is you know you have
 

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:17.220
service first step is you know you have
to make a class for your service and to

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:17.230
to make a class for your service and to
 

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:18.930
to make a class for your service and to
do that you need to declare it in your

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:18.940
do that you need to declare it in your
 

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:20.130
do that you need to declare it in your
manifest you have to say that this is

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:20.140
manifest you have to say that this is
 

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:21.840
manifest you have to say that this is
going to be here like this actually

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:21.850
going to be here like this actually
 

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:24.630
going to be here like this actually
exists and I'm going to use it and then

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:24.640
exists and I'm going to use it and then
 

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:26.640
exists and I'm going to use it and then
of course some of you may know export it

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:26.650
of course some of you may know export it
 

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:29.280
of course some of you may know export it
is this variable that says you can like

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:29.290
is this variable that says you can like
 

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:31.080
is this variable that says you can like
restrict to your app the service to only

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:31.090
restrict to your app the service to only
 

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:32.730
restrict to your app the service to only
being accessed by your app which is what

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:32.740
being accessed by your app which is what
 

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:34.530
being accessed by your app which is what
false means or if you say to true other

apps may be able to interact with your
 

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:37.380
apps may be able to interact with your
service and set it off with just

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:37.390
service and set it off with just
 

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:39.420
service and set it off with just
sometimes really valuable

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:39.430
sometimes really valuable
 

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:41.280
sometimes really valuable
you can also declare multiple services

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:41.290
you can also declare multiple services
 

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:42.840
you can also declare multiple services
you can have like 13 of them and each

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:42.850
you can have like 13 of them and each
 

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:44.610
you can have like 13 of them and each
one is a very targeted

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:44.620
one is a very targeted
 

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:46.200
one is a very targeted
service like definitely a real service

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:46.210
service like definitely a real service
 

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:47.820
service like definitely a real service
could be like definitely a real share

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:47.830
could be like definitely a real share
 

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:49.110
could be like definitely a real share
service and you have like definitely a

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:49.120
service and you have like definitely a
 

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:50.580
service and you have like definitely a
real backup service and everyone could

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:50.590
real backup service and everyone could
 

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:52.140
real backup service and everyone could
have its own specified tasks which makes

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:52.150
have its own specified tasks which makes
 

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:53.460
have its own specified tasks which makes
code main it's really easy and also

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:53.470
code main it's really easy and also
 

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:55.409
code main it's really easy and also
means it's a lot easier to track what's

00:06:55.409 --> 00:06:55.419
means it's a lot easier to track what's
 

00:06:55.419 --> 00:06:56.730
means it's a lot easier to track what's
going on and what things are going wrong

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:56.740
going on and what things are going wrong
 

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:58.650
going on and what things are going wrong
but most importantly your service needs

00:06:58.650 --> 00:06:58.660
but most importantly your service needs
 

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:01.320
but most importantly your service needs
to extend from intense service so here

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:01.330
to extend from intense service so here
 

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:02.790
to extend from intense service so here
you have got your class and the only

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:02.800
you have got your class and the only
 

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.409
you have got your class and the only
method you have to implement or override

00:07:04.409 --> 00:07:04.419
method you have to implement or override
 

00:07:04.419 --> 00:07:06.629
method you have to implement or override
by default is on handle intent you can

00:07:06.629 --> 00:07:06.639
by default is on handle intent you can
 

00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:07.770
by default is on handle intent you can
actually just ignore all the other ones

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:07.780
actually just ignore all the other ones
 

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:09.570
actually just ignore all the other ones
that's that whole lifecycle being

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:09.580
that's that whole lifecycle being
 

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:10.890
that's that whole lifecycle being
handled for you thing which is pretty

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:10.900
handled for you thing which is pretty
 

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:14.490
handled for you thing which is pretty
fantastic so on handle intent this is

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:14.500
fantastic so on handle intent this is
 

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:16.590
fantastic so on handle intent this is
where all of your work is going to

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:16.600
where all of your work is going to
 

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:19.200
where all of your work is going to
happen imagine that so maybe this is

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:19.210
happen imagine that so maybe this is
 

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:20.430
happen imagine that so maybe this is
where you're going to open a network

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:20.440
where you're going to open a network
 

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.320
where you're going to open a network
connection or send data to your server

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:22.330
connection or send data to your server
 

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:23.490
connection or send data to your server
and then you know clean up that

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:23.500
and then you know clean up that
 

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:24.570
and then you know clean up that
connection that would be pretty great

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:24.580
connection that would be pretty great
 

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:25.770
connection that would be pretty great
you know cleaning up your network

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:25.780
you know cleaning up your network
 

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:28.320
you know cleaning up your network
connections or maybe you want to write

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:28.330
connections or maybe you want to write
 

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:29.760
connections or maybe you want to write
to the SD card all of this kind of stuff

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:29.770
to the SD card all of this kind of stuff
 

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:31.650
to the SD card all of this kind of stuff
is like definitely not supposed to

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:31.660
is like definitely not supposed to
 

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:33.300
is like definitely not supposed to
affect your UI like maybe you'll send

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:33.310
affect your UI like maybe you'll send
 

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:34.800
affect your UI like maybe you'll send
the message like you know updated and

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:34.810
the message like you know updated and
 

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:36.350
the message like you know updated and
like change to something of the green

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:36.360
like change to something of the green
 

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:39.330
like change to something of the green
but all of the data you might need you

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:39.340
but all of the data you might need you
 

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:41.100
but all of the data you might need you
can put into that intent like as an

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:41.110
can put into that intent like as an
 

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:43.590
can put into that intent like as an
extra pass it along and then use that to

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:43.600
extra pass it along and then use that to
 

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:45.330
extra pass it along and then use that to
maybe kick off a notification or kick

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:45.340
maybe kick off a notification or kick
 

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:46.379
maybe kick off a notification or kick
off the work that you need to do

00:07:46.379 --> 00:07:46.389
off the work that you need to do
 

00:07:46.389 --> 00:07:47.820
off the work that you need to do
anything that's really relevant the

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:47.830
anything that's really relevant the
 

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:50.640
anything that's really relevant the
service is pretty versatile so once

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:50.650
service is pretty versatile so once
 

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:52.110
service is pretty versatile so once
you've got it written you need to invoke

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:52.120
you've got it written you need to invoke
 

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:53.490
you've got it written you need to invoke
it and this happens from usually an

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:53.500
it and this happens from usually an
 

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:55.770
it and this happens from usually an
activity and to do that you need to

00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:55.780
activity and to do that you need to
 

00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:57.540
activity and to do that you need to
create the intent fill it with something

00:07:57.540 --> 00:07:57.550
create the intent fill it with something
 

00:07:57.550 --> 00:08:00.089
create the intent fill it with something
and then pass it and passing it is great

00:08:00.089 --> 00:08:00.099
and then pass it and passing it is great
 

00:08:00.099 --> 00:08:01.260
and then pass it and passing it is great
you just call start service it's

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:01.270
you just call start service it's
 

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:03.690
you just call start service it's
actually that easy like okay started I'm

00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:03.700
actually that easy like okay started I'm
 

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:05.310
actually that easy like okay started I'm
ready like I said like intent service

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:05.320
ready like I said like intent service
 

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:06.779
ready like I said like intent service
manages its own life cycle you don't

00:08:06.779 --> 00:08:06.789
manages its own life cycle you don't
 

00:08:06.789 --> 00:08:09.150
manages its own life cycle you don't
have to like start it bind it all that

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:09.160
have to like start it bind it all that
 

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:10.379
have to like start it bind it all that
end stuff you just call start service

00:08:10.379 --> 00:08:10.389
end stuff you just call start service
 

00:08:10.389 --> 00:08:11.640
end stuff you just call start service
with the intent and you're done

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:11.650
with the intent and you're done
 

00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:13.140
with the intent and you're done
like that's actually all there is to it

00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:13.150
like that's actually all there is to it
 

00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:16.170
like that's actually all there is to it
and then with all of the data you passed

00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:16.180
and then with all of the data you passed
 

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:18.270
and then with all of the data you passed
along then your intent might be your

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:18.280
along then your intent might be your
 

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:19.439
along then your intent might be your
service might be able actually use that

00:08:19.439 --> 00:08:19.449
service might be able actually use that
 

00:08:19.449 --> 00:08:21.810
service might be able actually use that
same kind of intent to report back so

00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:21.820
same kind of intent to report back so
 

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:23.969
same kind of intent to report back so
give it enough information to know what

00:08:23.969 --> 00:08:23.979
give it enough information to know what
 

00:08:23.979 --> 00:08:25.290
give it enough information to know what
its job is and if a response isn't

00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:25.300
its job is and if a response isn't
 

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:29.129
its job is and if a response isn't
necessary - okay so you know that you

00:08:29.129 --> 00:08:29.139
necessary - okay so you know that you
 

00:08:29.139 --> 00:08:30.240
necessary - okay so you know that you
can use it with calling start service

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:30.250
can use it with calling start service
 

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:31.439
can use it with calling start service
but the question is when to call start

00:08:31.439 --> 00:08:31.449
but the question is when to call start
 

00:08:31.449 --> 00:08:33.240
but the question is when to call start
service and my advice is usually from a

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:33.250
service and my advice is usually from a
 

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:35.730
service and my advice is usually from a
broadcast receiver because these are

00:08:35.730 --> 00:08:35.740
broadcast receiver because these are
 

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:37.740
broadcast receiver because these are
really great ways of waiting for a

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:37.750
really great ways of waiting for a
 

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:39.949
really great ways of waiting for a
signal that something needs to happen

00:08:39.949 --> 00:08:39.959
signal that something needs to happen
 

00:08:39.959 --> 00:08:43.079
signal that something needs to happen
whenever like whenever anything actually

00:08:43.079 --> 00:08:43.089
whenever like whenever anything actually
 

00:08:43.089 --> 00:08:44.640
whenever like whenever anything actually
that needs to happen so a broadcast

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:44.650
that needs to happen so a broadcast
 

00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:46.199
that needs to happen so a broadcast
receivers job is to respond to an

00:08:46.199 --> 00:08:46.209
receivers job is to respond to an
 

00:08:46.209 --> 00:08:47.430
receivers job is to respond to an
announcement and that comes in the form

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:47.440
announcement and that comes in the form
 

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:49.350
announcement and that comes in the form
of yet another intent like these are

00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:49.360
of yet another intent like these are
 

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:50.760
of yet another intent like these are
magical little things of like I'd like

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:50.770
magical little things of like I'd like
 

00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:53.430
magical little things of like I'd like
to do this with these constraints so

00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:53.440
to do this with these constraints so
 

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:54.750
to do this with these constraints so
intent is a common trigger for kicking

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:54.760
intent is a common trigger for kicking
 

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:57.120
intent is a common trigger for kicking
off background work but which is great

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:57.130
off background work but which is great
 

00:08:57.130 --> 00:08:58.020
off background work but which is great
because a broadcast receiver

00:08:58.020 --> 00:08:58.030
because a broadcast receiver
 

00:08:58.030 --> 00:08:59.400
because a broadcast receiver
doesn't actually bring your app into the

00:08:59.400 --> 00:08:59.410
doesn't actually bring your app into the
 

00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:01.950
doesn't actually bring your app into the
foreground it can kick off a service

00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:01.960
foreground it can kick off a service
 

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:03.180
foreground it can kick off a service
that may or may not affect foreground

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:03.190
that may or may not affect foreground
 

00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:04.320
that may or may not affect foreground
work but like the broadcast receiver

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:04.330
work but like the broadcast receiver
 

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:07.170
work but like the broadcast receiver
itself opens like runs on receive and

00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:07.180
itself opens like runs on receive and
 

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:08.310
itself opens like runs on receive and
then triggers whatever's in that and

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:08.320
then triggers whatever's in that and
 

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:09.870
then triggers whatever's in that and
then stays all in the background so

00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:09.880
then stays all in the background so
 

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:11.310
then stays all in the background so
you're still protecting your main thread

00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:11.320
you're still protecting your main thread
 

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:12.470
you're still protecting your main thread
which is our goal here

00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:12.480
which is our goal here
 

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:15.780
which is our goal here
okay so broadcast receivers can actually

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:15.790
okay so broadcast receivers can actually
 

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:16.800
okay so broadcast receivers can actually
interact with several different sources

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:16.810
interact with several different sources
 

00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:18.870
interact with several different sources
like a local broadcast will come from

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:18.880
like a local broadcast will come from
 

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:21.120
like a local broadcast will come from
within your own app and this is a sign

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:21.130
within your own app and this is a sign
 

00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:22.770
within your own app and this is a sign
that maybe it's time to sync oh it's

00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:22.780
that maybe it's time to sync oh it's
 

00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:23.970
that maybe it's time to sync oh it's
going to kick off the service or maybe

00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:23.980
going to kick off the service or maybe
 

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:24.930
going to kick off the service or maybe
it's actually the intent service

00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:24.940
it's actually the intent service
 

00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:27.360
it's actually the intent service
reporting back about how the job winds

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:27.370
reporting back about how the job winds
 

00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:29.160
reporting back about how the job winds
are like you know this failed or that

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:29.170
are like you know this failed or that
 

00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:32.340
are like you know this failed or that
that's not a real URI app broadcast can

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:32.350
that's not a real URI app broadcast can
 

00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:34.320
that's not a real URI app broadcast can
also come from other apps on the device

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:34.330
also come from other apps on the device
 

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:35.520
also come from other apps on the device
which is really great when you're trying

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:35.530
which is really great when you're trying
 

00:09:35.530 --> 00:09:36.870
which is really great when you're trying
to take advantage of functionality that

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:36.880
to take advantage of functionality that
 

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:37.950
to take advantage of functionality that
you don't want to build but somebody

00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:37.960
you don't want to build but somebody
 

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:39.180
you don't want to build but somebody
else offers or you want to offer

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:39.190
else offers or you want to offer
 

00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:41.310
else offers or you want to offer
functionality to other developers so

00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:41.320
functionality to other developers so
 

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:42.990
functionality to other developers so
that you actually get users using a lot

00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:43.000
that you actually get users using a lot
 

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.520
that you actually get users using a lot
of different really great things you

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:44.530
of different really great things you
 

00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:46.200
of different really great things you
don't have to keep rebuilding you know

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:46.210
don't have to keep rebuilding you know
 

00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:48.090
don't have to keep rebuilding you know
picture-taking every time right or

00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:48.100
picture-taking every time right or
 

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:50.850
picture-taking every time right or
storage or something like that system

00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:50.860
storage or something like that system
 

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:51.900
storage or something like that system
broadcasts are really important they

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:51.910
broadcasts are really important they
 

00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:53.460
broadcasts are really important they
carry status information things like

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:53.470
carry status information things like
 

00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:54.990
carry status information things like
something being plugged in or like a

00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:55.000
something being plugged in or like a
 

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.610
something being plugged in or like a
signal that's changing something you

00:09:56.610 --> 00:09:56.620
signal that's changing something you
 

00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:58.080
signal that's changing something you
might be subscribed to so if you really

00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:58.090
might be subscribed to so if you really
 

00:09:58.090 --> 00:10:01.260
might be subscribed to so if you really
care about you know your app only runs

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:01.270
care about you know your app only runs
 

00:10:01.270 --> 00:10:02.580
care about you know your app only runs
when plugged in because maybe your sleep

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:02.590
when plugged in because maybe your sleep
 

00:10:02.590 --> 00:10:03.540
when plugged in because maybe your sleep
tracker and you don't want it to fall

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:03.550
tracker and you don't want it to fall
 

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:05.550
tracker and you don't want it to fall
asleep like wow the users also sleep

00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:05.560
asleep like wow the users also sleep
 

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:06.780
asleep like wow the users also sleep
that's the kind thing you like wait for

00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:06.790
that's the kind thing you like wait for
 

00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:08.160
that's the kind thing you like wait for
the signal on this and then if came

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:08.170
the signal on this and then if came
 

00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:09.570
the signal on this and then if came
unplugged you'd get a broadcast that

00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:09.580
unplugged you'd get a broadcast that
 

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:10.440
unplugged you'd get a broadcast that
it's unplugged and that might change

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:10.450
it's unplugged and that might change
 

00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:12.510
it's unplugged and that might change
your behavior you might like only stop

00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:12.520
your behavior you might like only stop
 

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:15.210
your behavior you might like only stop
tracking data to that point and finally

00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:15.220
tracking data to that point and finally
 

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:16.680
tracking data to that point and finally
you can use them for serve our messages

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:16.690
you can use them for serve our messages
 

00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:18.540
you can use them for serve our messages
like downstream messages GCM actually

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:18.550
like downstream messages GCM actually
 

00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:20.250
like downstream messages GCM actually
has its own dedicated broadcast receiver

00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:20.260
has its own dedicated broadcast receiver
 

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.440
has its own dedicated broadcast receiver
system which I'll tell you about doctor

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:22.450
system which I'll tell you about doctor
 

00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:23.940
system which I'll tell you about doctor
has done stream messages are a great way

00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:23.950
has done stream messages are a great way
 

00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:24.840
has done stream messages are a great way
for your server to indicate that

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:24.850
for your server to indicate that
 

00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:26.400
for your server to indicate that
something needs to happen now which the

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:26.410
something needs to happen now which the
 

00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:27.630
something needs to happen now which the
app might not be able to give a signal

00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:27.640
app might not be able to give a signal
 

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:30.750
app might not be able to give a signal
on right and so any kind of message so

00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:30.760
on right and so any kind of message so
 

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:32.460
on right and so any kind of message so
basically broadcast receivers are the

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:32.470
basically broadcast receivers are the
 

00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:33.840
basically broadcast receivers are the
best thing ever because any kind of

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:33.850
best thing ever because any kind of
 

00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:35.250
best thing ever because any kind of
message can come through and then you

00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:35.260
message can come through and then you
 

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:36.660
message can come through and then you
can react accordingly and maybe start

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:36.670
can react accordingly and maybe start
 

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:38.250
can react accordingly and maybe start
off any kind of different service and

00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:38.260
off any kind of different service and
 

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.860
off any kind of different service and
just like a service you can register

00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:40.870
just like a service you can register
 

00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:43.110
just like a service you can register
multiple receivers so let's talk about

00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:43.120
multiple receivers so let's talk about
 

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:44.490
multiple receivers so let's talk about
how to do that

00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:44.500
how to do that
 

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:46.200
how to do that
with an intent service is the same thing

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:46.210
with an intent service is the same thing
 

00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:48.510
with an intent service is the same thing
you have to create the actual class and

00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:48.520
you have to create the actual class and
 

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:50.760
you have to create the actual class and
then declare it your receiver in your

00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:50.770
then declare it your receiver in your
 

00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:53.040
then declare it your receiver in your
manifest looks roughly the same but the

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:53.050
manifest looks roughly the same but the
 

00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:54.420
manifest looks roughly the same but the
meet of everything here is going to live

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:54.430
meet of everything here is going to live
 

00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:56.700
meet of everything here is going to live
in this method called on receive it's

00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:56.710
in this method called on receive it's
 

00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:57.540
in this method called on receive it's
really the only thing you have to

00:10:57.540 --> 00:10:57.550
really the only thing you have to
 

00:10:57.550 --> 00:11:00.420
really the only thing you have to
override with a broadcast receiver and

00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:00.430
override with a broadcast receiver and
 

00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:01.530
override with a broadcast receiver and
this will do all of your intent

00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:01.540
this will do all of your intent
 

00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:02.970
this will do all of your intent
processing like you get the intent that

00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:02.980
processing like you get the intent that
 

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:05.970
processing like you get the intent that
comes through and any extras might

00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:05.980
comes through and any extras might
 

00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:07.440
comes through and any extras might
indicate what what kind of work you're

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:07.450
indicate what what kind of work you're
 

00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:08.700
indicate what what kind of work you're
doing here maybe your broadcast receiver

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:08.710
doing here maybe your broadcast receiver
 

00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:10.500
doing here maybe your broadcast receiver
does double duty maybe it doesn't but

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:10.510
does double duty maybe it doesn't but
 

00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:11.040
does double duty maybe it doesn't but
this will

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:11.050
this will
 

00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:12.540
this will
like I'll help you do any kind of

00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:12.550
like I'll help you do any kind of
 

00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:13.920
like I'll help you do any kind of
processing and kicking off at your

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:13.930
processing and kicking off at your
 

00:11:13.930 --> 00:11:17.009
processing and kicking off at your
service the thing about a broadcast

00:11:17.009 --> 00:11:17.019
service the thing about a broadcast
 

00:11:17.019 --> 00:11:19.350
service the thing about a broadcast
receiver is that it only lives for the

00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:19.360
receiver is that it only lives for the
 

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:21.180
receiver is that it only lives for the
duration of this on receive call which

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:21.190
duration of this on receive call which
 

00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:23.519
duration of this on receive call which
is like milliseconds so you can't do

00:11:23.519 --> 00:11:23.529
is like milliseconds so you can't do
 

00:11:23.529 --> 00:11:24.840
is like milliseconds so you can't do
your Korra if your background work in

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:24.850
your Korra if your background work in
 

00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:28.019
your Korra if your background work in
here you need to offload that to prevent

00:11:28.019 --> 00:11:28.029
here you need to offload that to prevent
 

00:11:28.029 --> 00:11:30.990
here you need to offload that to prevent
any further hanging because otherwise as

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:31.000
any further hanging because otherwise as
 

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.400
any further hanging because otherwise as
soon as this call completes a dice like

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:32.410
soon as this call completes a dice like
 

00:11:32.410 --> 00:11:33.569
soon as this call completes a dice like
also if you have like a helper method

00:11:33.569 --> 00:11:33.579
also if you have like a helper method
 

00:11:33.579 --> 00:11:34.650
also if you have like a helper method
like you just don't really have a chance

00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:34.660
like you just don't really have a chance
 

00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:38.310
like you just don't really have a chance
here okay so you also have to register

00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:38.320
here okay so you also have to register
 

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:39.930
here okay so you also have to register
your broadcast receiver like you have to

00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:39.940
your broadcast receiver like you have to
 

00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:41.579
your broadcast receiver like you have to
say which intents you're interested in

00:11:41.579 --> 00:11:41.589
say which intents you're interested in
 

00:11:41.589 --> 00:11:42.900
say which intents you're interested in
so you don't just get everything like

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:42.910
so you don't just get everything like
 

00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:44.069
so you don't just get everything like
that would be a nightmare like just

00:11:44.069 --> 00:11:44.079
that would be a nightmare like just
 

00:11:44.079 --> 00:11:46.889
that would be a nightmare like just
constant information coming in and I

00:11:46.889 --> 00:11:46.899
constant information coming in and I
 

00:11:46.899 --> 00:11:48.210
constant information coming in and I
recommend looking into what's called

00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:48.220
recommend looking into what's called
 

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:49.740
recommend looking into what's called
local broadcast manager because if

00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:49.750
local broadcast manager because if
 

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:50.940
local broadcast manager because if
you're really just using broadcast

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:50.950
you're really just using broadcast
 

00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:52.560
you're really just using broadcast
within your own app as a signal to and

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:52.570
within your own app as a signal to and
 

00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:55.650
within your own app as a signal to and
from services this is a great tool you

00:11:55.650 --> 00:11:55.660
from services this is a great tool you
 

00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:57.389
from services this is a great tool you
can also include like an intent filter

00:11:57.389 --> 00:11:57.399
can also include like an intent filter
 

00:11:57.399 --> 00:11:58.920
can also include like an intent filter
be like Olympus intent with these kinds

00:11:58.920 --> 00:11:58.930
be like Olympus intent with these kinds
 

00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:01.170
be like Olympus intent with these kinds
of parameters and stuff so let's do set

00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:01.180
of parameters and stuff so let's do set
 

00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:02.400
of parameters and stuff so let's do set
up everything for a number of situations

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:02.410
up everything for a number of situations
 

00:12:02.410 --> 00:12:04.230
up everything for a number of situations
and I think it's pretty great so check

00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:04.240
and I think it's pretty great so check
 

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:05.699
and I think it's pretty great so check
the docs on that because we're going to

00:12:05.699 --> 00:12:05.709
the docs on that because we're going to
 

00:12:05.709 --> 00:12:06.630
the docs on that because we're going to
move on to what's called a wakeful

00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:06.640
move on to what's called a wakeful
 

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:10.019
move on to what's called a wakeful
broadcast receiver I told you that on

00:12:10.019 --> 00:12:10.029
broadcast receiver I told you that on
 

00:12:10.029 --> 00:12:12.030
broadcast receiver I told you that on
receive only lasts look your app is only

00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:12.040
receive only lasts look your app is only
 

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:13.769
receive only lasts look your app is only
brought to life like the duration of on

00:12:13.769 --> 00:12:13.779
brought to life like the duration of on
 

00:12:13.779 --> 00:12:15.389
brought to life like the duration of on
receive which means that there's a

00:12:15.389 --> 00:12:15.399
receive which means that there's a
 

00:12:15.399 --> 00:12:17.490
receive which means that there's a
chance that between on receive and start

00:12:17.490 --> 00:12:17.500
chance that between on receive and start
 

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:19.500
chance that between on receive and start
service like on receive wraps and your

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:19.510
service like on receive wraps and your
 

00:12:19.510 --> 00:12:20.579
service like on receive wraps and your
service hasn't started that there's a

00:12:20.579 --> 00:12:20.589
service hasn't started that there's a
 

00:12:20.589 --> 00:12:22.079
service hasn't started that there's a
chance that the system might take away

00:12:22.079 --> 00:12:22.089
chance that the system might take away
 

00:12:22.089 --> 00:12:24.569
chance that the system might take away
your CPU time in between that so if you

00:12:24.569 --> 00:12:24.579
your CPU time in between that so if you
 

00:12:24.579 --> 00:12:26.400
your CPU time in between that so if you
need to guarantee that your service runs

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:26.410
need to guarantee that your service runs
 

00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:28.769
need to guarantee that your service runs
the moment that on receive ends you want

00:12:28.769 --> 00:12:28.779
the moment that on receive ends you want
 

00:12:28.779 --> 00:12:30.600
the moment that on receive ends you want
to acquire a way clock and you want to

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:30.610
to acquire a way clock and you want to
 

00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:31.920
to acquire a way clock and you want to
hold that way clock until your service

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:31.930
hold that way clock until your service
 

00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:33.900
hold that way clock until your service
has a chance to run but way clocks are

00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:33.910
has a chance to run but way clocks are
 

00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:35.310
has a chance to run but way clocks are
hard and you shouldn't have to waste

00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:35.320
hard and you shouldn't have to waste
 

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:37.350
hard and you shouldn't have to waste
your time on that because we did it for

00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:37.360
your time on that because we did it for
 

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:39.360
your time on that because we did it for
you we created the wakeful broadcast

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:39.370
you we created the wakeful broadcast
 

00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:40.889
you we created the wakeful broadcast
receiver which manages its own way

00:12:40.889 --> 00:12:40.899
receiver which manages its own way
 

00:12:40.899 --> 00:12:42.329
receiver which manages its own way
o'clock and still guarantees that your

00:12:42.329 --> 00:12:42.339
o'clock and still guarantees that your
 

00:12:42.339 --> 00:12:44.970
o'clock and still guarantees that your
service will run immediately after on

00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:44.980
service will run immediately after on
 

00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:47.970
service will run immediately after on
receive so again look at all these

00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:47.980
receive so again look at all these
 

00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:49.650
receive so again look at all these
things we did for you because background

00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:49.660
things we did for you because background
 

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:51.360
things we did for you because background
work is really hard let us manage it as

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:51.370
work is really hard let us manage it as
 

00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:52.829
work is really hard let us manage it as
much of the life cycle as we can unless

00:12:52.829 --> 00:12:52.839
much of the life cycle as we can unless
 

00:12:52.839 --> 00:12:54.389
much of the life cycle as we can unless
you have some sort of custom situation

00:12:54.389 --> 00:12:54.399
you have some sort of custom situation
 

00:12:54.399 --> 00:12:55.530
you have some sort of custom situation
and at that point you already doing tons

00:12:55.530 --> 00:12:55.540
and at that point you already doing tons
 

00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:58.410
and at that point you already doing tons
of research so you're golden right okay

00:12:58.410 --> 00:12:58.420
of research so you're golden right okay
 

00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:00.540
of research so you're golden right okay
so implementing we call a flow progress

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:00.550
so implementing we call a flow progress
 

00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:02.220
so implementing we call a flow progress
to see we're look it's exactly the same

00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:02.230
to see we're look it's exactly the same
 

00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:04.350
to see we're look it's exactly the same
except I added the word wakeful like

00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:04.360
except I added the word wakeful like
 

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:06.930
except I added the word wakeful like
it's not scary at all it's the only

00:13:06.930 --> 00:13:06.940
it's not scary at all it's the only
 

00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:09.840
it's not scary at all it's the only
change it's just I mean I'm serious like

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:09.850
change it's just I mean I'm serious like
 

00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:11.069
change it's just I mean I'm serious like
all these things we worked really hard

00:13:11.069 --> 00:13:11.079
all these things we worked really hard
 

00:13:11.079 --> 00:13:13.050
all these things we worked really hard
finally to like make these like great

00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:13.060
finally to like make these like great
 

00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:15.060
finally to like make these like great
tools for you because it wasn't easy for

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:15.070
tools for you because it wasn't easy for
 

00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:17.850
tools for you because it wasn't easy for
so long okay so I mentioned that GCM has

00:13:17.850 --> 00:13:17.860
so long okay so I mentioned that GCM has
 

00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:19.740
so long okay so I mentioned that GCM has
its own special situation and I'd like

00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:19.750
its own special situation and I'd like
 

00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:21.449
its own special situation and I'd like
to explain a little bit more about that

00:13:21.449 --> 00:13:21.459
to explain a little bit more about that
 

00:13:21.459 --> 00:13:24.809
to explain a little bit more about that
we really try to push GCM

00:13:24.809 --> 00:13:24.819
we really try to push GCM
 

00:13:24.819 --> 00:13:26.039
we really try to push GCM
not just because we like love our own

00:13:26.039 --> 00:13:26.049
not just because we like love our own
 

00:13:26.049 --> 00:13:28.199
not just because we like love our own
products but because if you have to

00:13:28.199 --> 00:13:28.209
products but because if you have to
 

00:13:28.209 --> 00:13:29.609
products but because if you have to
maintain a persistent network connection

00:13:29.609 --> 00:13:29.619
maintain a persistent network connection
 

00:13:29.619 --> 00:13:31.229
maintain a persistent network connection
on a device that's expensive it drains

00:13:31.229 --> 00:13:31.239
on a device that's expensive it drains
 

00:13:31.239 --> 00:13:33.779
on a device that's expensive it drains
Radio it drains CPU time it drains the

00:13:33.779 --> 00:13:33.789
Radio it drains CPU time it drains the
 

00:13:33.789 --> 00:13:35.489
Radio it drains CPU time it drains the
battery and so if every app is trying to

00:13:35.489 --> 00:13:35.499
battery and so if every app is trying to
 

00:13:35.499 --> 00:13:36.689
battery and so if every app is trying to
do their own homegrown version that's

00:13:36.689 --> 00:13:36.699
do their own homegrown version that's
 

00:13:36.699 --> 00:13:38.189
do their own homegrown version that's
going to be horrible but if we can

00:13:38.189 --> 00:13:38.199
going to be horrible but if we can
 

00:13:38.199 --> 00:13:39.900
going to be horrible but if we can
create one that the entire device knows

00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:39.910
create one that the entire device knows
 

00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:41.609
create one that the entire device knows
about that's like smart enough to know

00:13:41.609 --> 00:13:41.619
about that's like smart enough to know
 

00:13:41.619 --> 00:13:43.019
about that's like smart enough to know
when to pass things along to the right

00:13:43.019 --> 00:13:43.029
when to pass things along to the right
 

00:13:43.029 --> 00:13:44.340
when to pass things along to the right
apps and has the right access things

00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:44.350
apps and has the right access things
 

00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:46.559
apps and has the right access things
then we can save huge performance wins

00:13:46.559 --> 00:13:46.569
then we can save huge performance wins
 

00:13:46.569 --> 00:13:48.900
then we can save huge performance wins
huge user wins and huge developer effort

00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:48.910
huge user wins and huge developer effort
 

00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:50.549
huge user wins and huge developer effort
right and that's why you can see us

00:13:50.549 --> 00:13:50.559

messaging the other thing is that GM has
an advantage that your homegrown version

00:13:55.889 --> 00:13:55.899
an advantage that your homegrown version
 

00:13:55.899 --> 00:13:58.109
an advantage that your homegrown version
will never have and that's that all of

our carriers have worked with us to give

00:13:59.699 --> 00:13:59.709
our carriers have worked with us to give
 

00:13:59.709 --> 00:14:01.109
our carriers have worked with us to give
like special recognition to the port's

00:14:01.109 --> 00:14:01.119
like special recognition to the port's
 

00:14:01.119 --> 00:14:03.329
like special recognition to the port's
that GCM travels on to keep them open as

00:14:03.329 --> 00:14:03.339
that GCM travels on to keep them open as
 

00:14:03.339 --> 00:14:07.049
that GCM travels on to keep them open as
long as possible right and so any g-sync

00:14:07.049 --> 00:14:07.059
long as possible right and so any g-sync
 

00:14:07.059 --> 00:14:08.549
long as possible right and so any g-sync
like any messaging alternative that

00:14:08.549 --> 00:14:08.559
like any messaging alternative that
 

00:14:08.559 --> 00:14:09.539
like any messaging alternative that
you'll see it'll read on stream

00:14:09.539 --> 00:14:09.549
you'll see it'll read on stream
 

00:14:09.549 --> 00:14:10.949
you'll see it'll read on stream
messaging will usually be built on top

00:14:10.949 --> 00:14:10.959
messaging will usually be built on top
 

00:14:10.959 --> 00:14:12.659
messaging will usually be built on top
of GCM or will be built on like a

00:14:12.659 --> 00:14:12.669
of GCM or will be built on like a
 

00:14:12.669 --> 00:14:14.009
of GCM or will be built on like a
polling system and you don't if you

00:14:14.009 --> 00:14:14.019
polling system and you don't if you
 

00:14:14.019 --> 00:14:14.879
polling system and you don't if you
don't want to build your own polling

00:14:14.879 --> 00:14:14.889
don't want to build your own polling
 

00:14:14.889 --> 00:14:15.900
don't want to build your own polling
system why would you want to build on

00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:15.910
system why would you want to build on
 

00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:18.419
system why would you want to build on
top of another one right so throughout

00:14:18.419 --> 00:14:18.429

the conference as you see us all

00:14:19.889 --> 00:14:19.899
the conference as you see us all
 

00:14:19.899 --> 00:14:21.239
the conference as you see us all
basically force-feeding you juicing them

00:14:21.239 --> 00:14:21.249
basically force-feeding you juicing them
 

00:14:21.249 --> 00:14:22.439
basically force-feeding you juicing them
know that we have a really good reason

00:14:22.439 --> 00:14:22.449
know that we have a really good reason
 

00:14:22.449 --> 00:14:24.329
know that we have a really good reason
for it it's not just because we happen

00:14:24.329 --> 00:14:24.339
for it it's not just because we happen
 

00:14:24.339 --> 00:14:28.019
for it it's not just because we happen
to be the cousins with it okay so the

00:14:28.019 --> 00:14:28.029
to be the cousins with it okay so the
 

00:14:28.029 --> 00:14:29.489
to be the cousins with it okay so the
other thing about GCM receiver is it

00:14:29.489 --> 00:14:29.499
other thing about GCM receiver is it
 

00:14:29.499 --> 00:14:31.259
other thing about GCM receiver is it
actually extends from wakeful broadcast

00:14:31.259 --> 00:14:31.269
actually extends from wakeful broadcast
 

00:14:31.269 --> 00:14:32.340
actually extends from wakeful broadcast
receiver so you get that way clock

00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:32.350
receiver so you get that way clock
 

00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:34.079
receiver so you get that way clock
management by default which is even

00:14:34.079 --> 00:14:34.089
management by default which is even
 

00:14:34.089 --> 00:14:36.029
management by default which is even
better so to use it you have to declare

00:14:36.029 --> 00:14:36.039
better so to use it you have to declare
 

00:14:36.039 --> 00:14:37.319
better so to use it you have to declare
your receiver the way you would any way

00:14:37.319 --> 00:14:37.329
your receiver the way you would any way
 

00:14:37.329 --> 00:14:39.210
your receiver the way you would any way
any other receiver except you have to

00:14:39.210 --> 00:14:39.220
any other receiver except you have to
 

00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:41.039
any other receiver except you have to
have a something special which is the

00:14:41.039 --> 00:14:41.049
have a something special which is the
 

00:14:41.049 --> 00:14:44.129
have a something special which is the
permission to send that means that you

00:14:44.129 --> 00:14:44.139
permission to send that means that you
 

00:14:44.139 --> 00:14:45.569
permission to send that means that you
are basically adhering to the permission

00:14:45.569 --> 00:14:45.579
are basically adhering to the permission
 

00:14:45.579 --> 00:14:49.529
are basically adhering to the permission
required by GCM because it will you want

00:14:49.529 --> 00:14:49.539
required by GCM because it will you want
 

00:14:49.539 --> 00:14:51.479
required by GCM because it will you want
you want protected communications so GCM

00:14:51.479 --> 00:14:51.489
you want protected communications so GCM
 

00:14:51.489 --> 00:14:53.069
you want protected communications so GCM
service requires this permission and you

00:14:53.069 --> 00:14:53.079
service requires this permission and you
 

00:14:53.079 --> 00:14:54.539
service requires this permission and you
honor that permission and that's what

00:14:54.539 --> 00:14:54.549
honor that permission and that's what
 

00:14:54.549 --> 00:14:56.819
honor that permission and that's what
this lets you do declare it in your

00:14:56.819 --> 00:14:56.829
this lets you do declare it in your
 

00:14:56.829 --> 00:14:58.889
this lets you do declare it in your
manifest and then also you set up an

00:14:58.889 --> 00:14:58.899
manifest and then also you set up an
 

00:14:58.899 --> 00:15:01.249
manifest and then also you set up an
instant filter to say like I want all

00:15:01.249 --> 00:15:01.259
instant filter to say like I want all
 

00:15:01.259 --> 00:15:03.869
instant filter to say like I want all
receiving messages from GCM to my

00:15:03.869 --> 00:15:03.879
receiving messages from GCM to my
 

00:15:03.879 --> 00:15:07.739
receiving messages from GCM to my
application right super easy okay so

00:15:07.739 --> 00:15:07.749
application right super easy okay so
 

00:15:07.749 --> 00:15:09.779
application right super easy okay so
then you build your listener service you

00:15:09.779 --> 00:15:09.789
then you build your listener service you
 

00:15:09.789 --> 00:15:11.099
then you build your listener service you
look Patino so you don't have to build a

00:15:11.099 --> 00:15:11.109
look Patino so you don't have to build a
 

00:15:11.109 --> 00:15:12.509
look Patino so you don't have to build a
receiver you don't have to extend from

00:15:12.509 --> 00:15:12.519
receiver you don't have to extend from
 

00:15:12.519 --> 00:15:14.129
receiver you don't have to extend from
GCM receiver like that already exists

00:15:14.129 --> 00:15:14.139
GCM receiver like that already exists
 

00:15:14.139 --> 00:15:15.749
GCM receiver like that already exists
for you you just have to use it by

00:15:15.749 --> 00:15:15.759
for you you just have to use it by
 

00:15:15.759 --> 00:15:17.909
for you you just have to use it by
declaring it and then all you have to do

00:15:17.909 --> 00:15:17.919
declaring it and then all you have to do
 

00:15:17.919 --> 00:15:19.769
declaring it and then all you have to do
is override your listener service it's

00:15:19.769 --> 00:15:19.779
is override your listener service it's
 

00:15:19.779 --> 00:15:21.539
is override your listener service it's
not an intent service but it's still

00:15:21.539 --> 00:15:21.549
not an intent service but it's still
 

00:15:21.549 --> 00:15:22.739
not an intent service but it's still
pretty great because you don't have to

00:15:22.739 --> 00:15:22.749
pretty great because you don't have to
 

00:15:22.749 --> 00:15:25.769
pretty great because you don't have to
manage any lifecycle still and then your

00:15:25.769 --> 00:15:25.779
manage any lifecycle still and then your
 

00:15:25.779 --> 00:15:27.179
manage any lifecycle still and then your
message comes in with like who it's from

00:15:27.179 --> 00:15:27.189
message comes in with like who it's from
 

00:15:27.189 --> 00:15:29.249
message comes in with like who it's from
so you get your server ID you can double

00:15:29.249 --> 00:15:29.259
so you get your server ID you can double
 

00:15:29.259 --> 00:15:30.149
so you get your server ID you can double
check that like you're getting it from

00:15:30.149 --> 00:15:30.159
check that like you're getting it from
 

00:15:30.159 --> 00:15:31.259
check that like you're getting it from
right message in case maybe you have

00:15:31.259 --> 00:15:31.269
right message in case maybe you have
 

00:15:31.269 --> 00:15:32.970
right message in case maybe you have
multiple different things and you get

00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:32.980
multiple different things and you get
 

00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:34.349
multiple different things and you get
all the information you need in data

00:15:34.349 --> 00:15:34.359
all the information you need in data
 

00:15:34.359 --> 00:15:37.049
all the information you need in data
based on how you structure your own data

00:15:37.049 --> 00:15:37.059
based on how you structure your own data
 

00:15:37.059 --> 00:15:38.140
based on how you structure your own data
when you send it

00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:38.150
when you send it
 

00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:40.360
when you send it
so great so great why are you not doing

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:40.370
so great so great why are you not doing
 

00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:46.390
so great so great why are you not doing
this okay so now we can move on from how

00:15:46.390 --> 00:15:46.400
this okay so now we can move on from how
 

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:48.100
this okay so now we can move on from how
background works specifically is like

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:48.110
background works specifically is like
 

00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:50.860
background works specifically is like
goes like how to implement it to when to

00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:50.870
goes like how to implement it to when to
 

00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:52.540
goes like how to implement it to when to
implement it and how to invoke it right

00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:52.550
implement it and how to invoke it right
 

00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:53.860
implement it and how to invoke it right
like you know that you can call start

00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:53.870
like you know that you can call start
 

00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:55.660
like you know that you can call start
service but the question is like what do

00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:55.670
service but the question is like what do
 

00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:57.070
service but the question is like what do
you really use to trigger a reminder

00:15:57.070 --> 00:15:57.080
you really use to trigger a reminder
 

00:15:57.080 --> 00:16:00.340
you really use to trigger a reminder
when it comes later and like when when

00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:00.350
when it comes later and like when when
 

00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:01.510
when it comes later and like when when
does it need to come later so

00:16:01.510 --> 00:16:01.520
does it need to come later so
 

00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:03.370
does it need to come later so
considering that question of when if you

00:16:03.370 --> 00:16:03.380
considering that question of when if you
 

00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:05.350
considering that question of when if you
need your work to run at a specific

00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:05.360
need your work to run at a specific
 

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:07.960
need your work to run at a specific
moment in time you're going to get to

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:07.970
moment in time you're going to get to
 

00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:10.240
moment in time you're going to get to
meet the alarm manager so an alarm is

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:10.250
meet the alarm manager so an alarm is
 

00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:12.040
meet the alarm manager so an alarm is
not like a wake-up alarm like doing an

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:12.050
not like a wake-up alarm like doing an
 

00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:13.900
not like a wake-up alarm like doing an
evening alarm is a signal to your app

00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:13.910
evening alarm is a signal to your app
 

00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:15.670
evening alarm is a signal to your app
that it's time for your app to wake up

00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:15.680
that it's time for your app to wake up
 

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:19.630
that it's time for your app to wake up
and do some more work and when you

00:16:19.630 --> 00:16:19.640
and do some more work and when you
 

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:21.310
and do some more work and when you
register an intent with an alarm it'll

00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:21.320
register an intent with an alarm it'll
 

00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:23.320
register an intent with an alarm it'll
actually fire that intent as soon as it

00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:23.330
actually fire that intent as soon as it
 

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:25.560
actually fire that intent as soon as it
fires through the alarm manager so

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:25.570
fires through the alarm manager so
 

00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:28.150
fires through the alarm manager so
setting alarms with alarm manager just

00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:28.160
setting alarms with alarm manager just
 

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:30.130
setting alarms with alarm manager just
had a single alarm with anything that's

00:16:30.130 --> 00:16:30.140
had a single alarm with anything that's
 

00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:33.220
had a single alarm with anything that's
above API 19 you can call set look how

00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:33.230
above API 19 you can call set look how
 

00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:34.690
above API 19 you can call set look how
simple that is and it sets a single and

00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:34.700
simple that is and it sets a single and
 

00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:37.090
simple that is and it sets a single and
exact alarm and what in exact means is

00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:37.100
exact alarm and what in exact means is
 

00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:39.550
exact alarm and what in exact means is
that let's say your alarms mr. golf like

00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:39.560
that let's say your alarms mr. golf like
 

00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:41.140
that let's say your alarms mr. golf like
in an hour it will not go off before

00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:41.150
in an hour it will not go off before
 

00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:42.699
in an hour it will not go off before
that hour but it may go off sometime

00:16:42.699 --> 00:16:42.709
that hour but it may go off sometime
 

00:16:42.709 --> 00:16:44.410
that hour but it may go off sometime
after that hour if the system is trying

00:16:44.410 --> 00:16:44.420
after that hour if the system is trying
 

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:45.880
after that hour if the system is trying
to intelligently batch things together

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:45.890
to intelligently batch things together
 

00:16:45.890 --> 00:16:47.860
to intelligently batch things together
right because we want to we want to save

00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:47.870
right because we want to we want to save
 

00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:49.360
right because we want to we want to save
battery as much as possible so if we

battery as much as possible so if we
 

00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:50.410
battery as much as possible so if we
know that there are four alarms coming

00:16:50.410 --> 00:16:50.420
know that there are four alarms coming
 

00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:51.790
know that there are four alarms coming
up sometime between 3 &amp; 4 we might try

00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:51.800
up sometime between 3 &amp; 4 we might try
 

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:54.070
up sometime between 3 &amp; 4 we might try
to run them all at the same time but it

00:16:54.070 --> 00:16:54.080
to run them all at the same time but it
 

00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:55.360
to run them all at the same time but it
will never fire early and that's a

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:55.370
will never fire early and that's a
 

00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:58.570
will never fire early and that's a
guarantee we also have set window which

00:16:58.570 --> 00:16:58.580
guarantee we also have set window which
 

00:16:58.580 --> 00:16:59.860
guarantee we also have set window which
is if you're flexible and you don't

00:16:59.860 --> 00:16:59.870
is if you're flexible and you don't
 

00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:01.420
is if you're flexible and you don't
really mind using set like you want to

00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:01.430
really mind using set like you want to
 

00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:03.579
really mind using set like you want to
have a definite like a duration of time

00:17:03.579 --> 00:17:03.589
have a definite like a duration of time
 

00:17:03.589 --> 00:17:04.840
have a definite like a duration of time
this is pretty great because you can

00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:04.850
this is pretty great because you can
 

00:17:04.850 --> 00:17:06.460
this is pretty great because you can
specify what that window is going to be

00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:06.470
specify what that window is going to be
 

00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:08.799
specify what that window is going to be
and then for when it really does matter

00:17:08.799 --> 00:17:08.809
and then for when it really does matter
 

00:17:08.809 --> 00:17:10.750
and then for when it really does matter
we have set an exact in order to specify

00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:10.760
we have set an exact in order to specify
 

00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:12.370
we have set an exact in order to specify
that time actually really does matter

00:17:12.370 --> 00:17:12.380
that time actually really does matter
 

00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:13.660
that time actually really does matter
and this is important for maybe like a

00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:13.670
and this is important for maybe like a
 

00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:15.610
and this is important for maybe like a
calendar reminder if you're 40 minutes

00:17:15.610 --> 00:17:15.620
calendar reminder if you're 40 minutes
 

00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:16.809
calendar reminder if you're 40 minutes
late on that you've actually really

00:17:16.809 --> 00:17:16.819
late on that you've actually really
 

00:17:16.819 --> 00:17:19.240
late on that you've actually really
messed up with your users life the other

00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:19.250
messed up with your users life the other

thing to note is that any API before 19

00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:21.970
thing to note is that any API before 19
 

00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:24.309
thing to note is that any API before 19
set inset exact or equivalent because

00:17:24.309 --> 00:17:24.319
set inset exact or equivalent because
 

00:17:24.319 --> 00:17:25.600
set inset exact or equivalent because
we've been actually introduced in exact

00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:25.610
we've been actually introduced in exact

exact how great is that
 

00:17:32.059 --> 00:17:35.860
exact how great is that
ok so to do this look how few lines of

00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:35.870
ok so to do this look how few lines of
 

00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:37.240
ok so to do this look how few lines of
code this is like this isn't terrifying

00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:37.250
code this is like this isn't terrifying
 

00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:39.430

like you don't have to worry you just

00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:39.440
like you don't have to worry you just
 

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:41.049
like you don't have to worry you just
you know get the alarmmanager service

00:17:41.049 --> 00:17:41.059
you know get the alarmmanager service
 

00:17:41.059 --> 00:17:43.210
you know get the alarmmanager service
from the system create your intent and

00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:43.220
from the system create your intent and
 

00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:45.010
from the system create your intent and
you have to turn your intent into a

00:17:45.010 --> 00:17:45.020
you have to turn your intent into a
 

00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:46.660
you have to turn your intent into a
pending intent and that's how this the

00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:46.670
pending intent and that's how this the
 

00:17:46.670 --> 00:17:47.890
pending intent and that's how this the
alarm manager is able to actually fire

00:17:47.890 --> 00:17:47.900
alarm manager is able to actually fire
 

00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:51.120
alarm manager is able to actually fire
it definitely is request codes here

00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:51.130
it definitely is request codes here
 

00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:53.610
it definitely is request codes here
so I'm skipping you could you could call

00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:53.620
so I'm skipping you could you could call
 

00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:54.840
so I'm skipping you could you could call
a receiver here that would make a lot of

a receiver here that would make a lot of
 

00:17:54.850 --> 00:17:56.070
a receiver here that would make a lot of
sense because maybe you want to react to

00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:56.080
sense because maybe you want to react to
 

00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:57.210
sense because maybe you want to react to
like a different kind of thing

00:17:57.210 --> 00:17:57.220

I'm just leaping straight to the surface
 

00:17:58.600 --> 00:17:59.970
I'm just leaping straight to the surface
like I know that this alarm means it's

00:17:59.970 --> 00:17:59.980
like I know that this alarm means it's

time to run this thing I'm just gonna
 

00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:03.900
time to run this thing I'm just gonna
invoke that service directly and then I

00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:03.910
invoke that service directly and then I
 

00:18:03.910 --> 00:18:05.760
invoke that service directly and then I
set it up for whenever I wanted to go

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:05.770
set it up for whenever I wanted to go
 

00:18:05.770 --> 00:18:06.690
set it up for whenever I wanted to go

I didn't declare that because I don't

00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:08.080
I didn't declare that because I don't

I didn't declare that because I don't
know why I'm here maybe I want to be in

00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:09.520
know why I'm here maybe I want to be in

an hour okay different situation maybe

00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:11.920
an hour okay different situation maybe
 

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:13.590
an hour okay different situation maybe
you don't want a single alarm maybe you

00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:13.600
you don't want a single alarm maybe you
 

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:15.600
you don't want a single alarm maybe you
want alarm that repeats itself on like

00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:15.610
want alarm that repeats itself on like
 

00:18:15.610 --> 00:18:18.420
want alarm that repeats itself on like
on its own schedule this is surprisingly

00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:18.430
on its own schedule this is surprisingly
 

00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:20.700
on its own schedule this is surprisingly
still alarm manager you're not surprised

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:20.710
still alarm manager you're not surprised
 

00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:23.910
still alarm manager you're not surprised
it's not a surprise okay so with

00:18:23.910 --> 00:18:23.920
it's not a surprise okay so with
 

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:26.550
it's not a surprise okay so with
repeating alarms we have nothing on set

00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:26.560
repeating alarms we have nothing on set
 

00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:29.010
repeating alarms we have nothing on set
an exact repeating for guess what an

00:18:29.010 --> 00:18:29.020
an exact repeating for guess what an
 

00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:31.080
an exact repeating for guess what an
exact repeating alarms so you specify a

00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:31.090
exact repeating alarms so you specify a
 

00:18:31.090 --> 00:18:32.760
exact repeating alarms so you specify a
period of time like maybe you need it to

00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:32.770
period of time like maybe you need it to
 

00:18:32.770 --> 00:18:35.130
period of time like maybe you need it to
go off every hour but not necessarily on

00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:35.140
go off every hour but not necessarily on
 

00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:36.720
go off every hour but not necessarily on
the hour you have a little bit of get

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:36.730
the hour you have a little bit of get
 

00:18:36.730 --> 00:18:38.790
the hour you have a little bit of get
there so we'll go off every hour but you

00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:38.800
there so we'll go off every hour but you
 

00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:42.330
there so we'll go off every hour but you
know maybe maybe at 15 maybe not which

00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:42.340
know maybe maybe at 15 maybe not which
 

00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:44.010
know maybe maybe at 15 maybe not which
is pretty fantastic as far as like I

00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:44.020
is pretty fantastic as far as like I
 

00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:45.360
is pretty fantastic as far as like I
need this to be done fairly regularly

00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:45.370
need this to be done fairly regularly
 

00:18:45.370 --> 00:18:47.070
need this to be done fairly regularly
but I don't specifically care that it's

00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:47.080
but I don't specifically care that it's
 

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:49.920
but I don't specifically care that it's
at 4:02 p.m. and then that means that

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:49.930
at 4:02 p.m. and then that means that
 

00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:51.390
at 4:02 p.m. and then that means that
you can you know talk about set exact

00:18:51.390 --> 00:18:51.400
you can you know talk about set exact
 

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:52.650
you can you know talk about set exact
repeating except this doesn't exist

00:18:52.650 --> 00:18:52.660
repeating except this doesn't exist
 

00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:54.000
repeating except this doesn't exist
that's not a thing we didn't create that

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:54.010
that's not a thing we didn't create that
 

00:18:54.010 --> 00:18:55.620
that's not a thing we didn't create that
because it doesn't make a whole lot of

00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:55.630
because it doesn't make a whole lot of
 

00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:58.380
because it doesn't make a whole lot of
sense we actually say use set exact to

00:18:58.380 --> 00:18:58.390
sense we actually say use set exact to
 

00:18:58.390 --> 00:18:59.970
sense we actually say use set exact to
set a repeating alarm and then when it

00:18:59.970 --> 00:18:59.980
set a repeating alarm and then when it
 

00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:01.530
set a repeating alarm and then when it
triggers that one set the next one

00:19:01.530 --> 00:19:01.540
triggers that one set the next one
 

00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:03.540
triggers that one set the next one
because if it's that exact you probably

00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:03.550
because if it's that exact you probably
 

00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:05.040
because if it's that exact you probably
have something else you care about and

00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:05.050
have something else you care about and
 

00:19:05.050 --> 00:19:08.100
have something else you care about and
you probably want to check on that the

00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:08.110
you probably want to check on that the
 

00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:09.360
you probably want to check on that the
other truth is we actually don't really

00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:09.370
other truth is we actually don't really
 

00:19:09.370 --> 00:19:10.380
other truth is we actually don't really
recommend this either we'd rather you

00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:10.390
recommend this either we'd rather you
 

00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:12.360
recommend this either we'd rather you
just not set exact repeating alarms at

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:12.370
just not set exact repeating alarms at
 

00:19:12.370 --> 00:19:14.370
just not set exact repeating alarms at
all so setting an exact repeating is

00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:14.380
all so setting an exact repeating is
 

00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:15.750
all so setting an exact repeating is
really your answer but if you can need a

00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:15.760
really your answer but if you can need a
 

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:17.280
really your answer but if you can need a
special use case just do it one at a

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:17.290
special use case just do it one at a
 

00:19:17.290 --> 00:19:19.560
special use case just do it one at a
time and build that into how you manage

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:19.570
time and build that into how you manage
 

00:19:19.570 --> 00:19:22.200
time and build that into how you manage
your alarm so to set an exact repeating

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:22.210
your alarm so to set an exact repeating
 

00:19:22.210 --> 00:19:24.240
your alarm so to set an exact repeating
alarm you see how it's pretty much

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:24.250
alarm you see how it's pretty much
 

00:19:24.250 --> 00:19:25.950
alarm you see how it's pretty much
exactly the same as far as setting it up

00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:25.960
exactly the same as far as setting it up
 

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:27.210
exactly the same as far as setting it up
and then you call set in things like

00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:27.220
and then you call set in things like
 

00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:28.650
and then you call set in things like
repeating but instead of just saying the

00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:28.660
repeating but instead of just saying the
 

00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:29.670
repeating but instead of just saying the
time to trigger you have to add that

00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:29.680
time to trigger you have to add that
 

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:31.020
time to trigger you have to add that
interval that the interval that you

00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:31.030
interval that the interval that you
 

00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:33.090
interval that the interval that you
really care about again I just made up a

00:19:33.090 --> 00:19:33.100
really care about again I just made up a
 

00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:34.590
really care about again I just made up a
variable because I don't specifically

00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:34.600
variable because I don't specifically
 

00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:36.120
variable because I don't specifically
care about counting up milliseconds

00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:36.130
care about counting up milliseconds
 

00:19:36.130 --> 00:19:39.930

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:35.810
finished so maybe you were waiting for a
 

00:22:35.810 --> 00:22:37.600
finished so maybe you were waiting for a
Wi-Fi and then you had it but the user

00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:37.610
Wi-Fi and then you had it but the user
 

00:22:37.610 --> 00:22:39.430
Wi-Fi and then you had it but the user
left the Wi-Fi zone and now you don't

00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:39.440
left the Wi-Fi zone and now you don't
 

00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:40.570
left the Wi-Fi zone and now you don't
have it anymore but you haven't finished

00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:40.580
have it anymore but you haven't finished
 

00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:43.420
have it anymore but you haven't finished
so we cancelled the job because you know

00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:43.430
so we cancelled the job because you know
 

00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:44.770
so we cancelled the job because you know
this conditions aren't being met anymore

00:22:44.770 --> 00:22:44.780
this conditions aren't being met anymore
 

00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:46.750
this conditions aren't being met anymore
and so this is about this boolean is for

00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:46.760
and so this is about this boolean is for
 

00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:47.950
and so this is about this boolean is for
whatever cleanup you need to do is

00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:47.960
whatever cleanup you need to do is
 

00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:49.810
whatever cleanup you need to do is
important but also you need to return

00:22:49.810 --> 00:22:49.820
important but also you need to return
 

00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:51.910
important but also you need to return
true if you want to reschedule that job

00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:51.920
true if you want to reschedule that job
 

00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:53.260
true if you want to reschedule that job
because it didn't have a chance to run

00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:53.270
because it didn't have a chance to run
 

00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:55.180
because it didn't have a chance to run
but if it didn't really matter then you

00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:55.190
but if it didn't really matter then you
 

00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:56.500
but if it didn't really matter then you
can return false and it will just be

00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:56.510
can return false and it will just be
 

00:22:56.510 --> 00:22:59.740
can return false and it will just be
dropped so that's what those super

00:22:59.740 --> 00:22:59.750
dropped so that's what those super
 

00:22:59.750 --> 00:23:02.770
dropped so that's what those super
indicative boolean's are and then that

00:23:02.770 --> 00:23:02.780
indicative boolean's are and then that
 

00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:04.060
indicative boolean's are and then that
third method that you don't override but

00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:04.070
third method that you don't override but
 

00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:05.260
third method that you don't override but
you need to call that lives inside of

00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:05.270
you need to call that lives inside of
 

00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:06.790
you need to call that lives inside of
job services job finished and this is

00:23:06.790 --> 00:23:06.800
job services job finished and this is
 

00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:08.320
job services job finished and this is
how you call it

00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:08.330
how you call it
 

00:23:08.330 --> 00:23:11.950
how you call it
you need to in your service like way

00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:11.960
you need to in your service like way
 

00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:14.740
you need to in your service like way
away that you've kicked off - once

00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:14.750
away that you've kicked off - once
 

00:23:14.750 --> 00:23:15.820
away that you've kicked off - once
you're done with your work you call this

00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:15.830
you're done with your work you call this
 

00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:17.620
you're done with your work you call this
and you pass back the job parameters

00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:17.630
and you pass back the job parameters
 

00:23:17.630 --> 00:23:20.140
and you pass back the job parameters
that were passed in you see from here

00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:20.150
that were passed in you see from here
 

00:23:20.150 --> 00:23:22.810
that were passed in you see from here
you're on staff job so I included a

00:23:22.810 --> 00:23:22.820
you're on staff job so I included a
 

00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:24.070
you're on staff job so I included a
minute up but you need to pass those

00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:24.080
minute up but you need to pass those
 

00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:25.510
minute up but you need to pass those
parameters back to indicate which job

00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:25.520
parameters back to indicate which job
 

00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:27.280
parameters back to indicate which job
we're finished with and this tells the

00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:27.290
we're finished with and this tells the
 

00:23:27.290 --> 00:23:28.630
we're finished with and this tells the
system that we actually completed like

00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:28.640
system that we actually completed like
 

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:30.160
system that we actually completed like
we're good we're very very happy and

00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:30.170
we're good we're very very happy and
 

00:23:30.170 --> 00:23:31.210
we're good we're very very happy and
we're done and you don't have to worry

00:23:31.210 --> 00:23:31.220
we're done and you don't have to worry
 

00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:33.310
we're done and you don't have to worry
about Reese so your scheduling unless

00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:33.320
about Reese so your scheduling unless
 

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:35.350
about Reese so your scheduling unless
you failed at your job maybe like the

00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:35.360
you failed at your job maybe like the
 

00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:36.340
you failed at your job maybe like the
network connection fell through or

00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:36.350
network connection fell through or
 

00:23:36.350 --> 00:23:37.990
network connection fell through or
something on your servers end and so

00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:38.000
something on your servers end and so
 

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.730
something on your servers end and so
that's what that boolean here means so

00:23:41.730 --> 00:23:41.740
that's what that boolean here means so
 

00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:43.720
that's what that boolean here means so
true means we need to reschedule with a

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:43.730
true means we need to reschedule with a
 

00:23:43.730 --> 00:23:46.890
true means we need to reschedule with a
job and false means that work and

00:23:46.890 --> 00:23:46.900
job and false means that work and
 

00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:49.360
job and false means that work and
rescheduling true will kick off job

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:49.370
rescheduling true will kick off job
 

00:23:49.370 --> 00:23:51.040
rescheduling true will kick off job
scheduler has a built-in exponential

00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:51.050
scheduler has a built-in exponential
 

00:23:51.050 --> 00:23:52.510
scheduler has a built-in exponential
back-off for you you don't have to do

00:23:52.510 --> 00:23:52.520
back-off for you you don't have to do
 

00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:53.770
back-off for you you don't have to do
that math you don't have to like track

00:23:53.770 --> 00:23:53.780
that math you don't have to like track
 

00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:55.510
that math you don't have to like track
of like when when you want to retry like

00:23:55.510 --> 00:23:55.520
of like when when you want to retry like
 

00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:57.160
of like when when you want to retry like
will do that intelligently on your

00:23:57.160 --> 00:23:57.170
will do that intelligently on your
 

00:23:57.170 --> 00:23:58.390
will do that intelligently on your
behalf we just know that you didn't

00:23:58.390 --> 00:23:58.400
behalf we just know that you didn't
 

00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:00.010
behalf we just know that you didn't
succeed and you want to try again and so

00:24:00.010 --> 00:24:00.020
succeed and you want to try again and so
 

00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:02.530
succeed and you want to try again and so
we'll reschedule you look how helpful we

00:24:02.530 --> 00:24:02.540
we'll reschedule you look how helpful we
 

00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:03.580
we'll reschedule you look how helpful we
are okay

00:24:03.580 --> 00:24:03.590
are okay
 

00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:04.900
are okay
I like how thought about it we like I

00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:04.910
I like how thought about it we like I
 

00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:06.070
I like how thought about it we like I
didn't work on this I just know how to

00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:06.080
didn't work on this I just know how to
 

00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:08.740
didn't work on this I just know how to
use it you need to register your service

00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:08.750
use it you need to register your service
 

00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:11.140
use it you need to register your service
as usual but you also need to bind to

00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:11.150
as usual but you also need to bind to
 

00:24:11.150 --> 00:24:12.400
as usual but you also need to bind to
the job service and so yet another

00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:12.410
the job service and so yet another
 

00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:14.740
the job service and so yet another
permission that's nested in with our

00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:14.750
permission that's nested in with our
 

00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:17.710
permission that's nested in with our
declaration and finally you create the

00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:17.720
declaration and finally you create the
 

00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:19.870
declaration and finally you create the
scheduler so this is going to be

00:24:19.870 --> 00:24:19.880
scheduler so this is going to be
 

00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:21.580
scheduler so this is going to be
probably in an activity wherever you're

00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:21.590
probably in an activity wherever you're
 

00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:24.340
probably in an activity wherever you're
keeping track of your thing and there's

00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:24.350
keeping track of your thing and there's
 

00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:26.560
keeping track of your thing and there's
a couple pieces here so second bit of

00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:26.570
a couple pieces here so second bit of
 

00:24:26.570 --> 00:24:27.700
a couple pieces here so second bit of
this is the job scheduler we're just

00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:27.710
this is the job scheduler we're just
 

00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:29.350
this is the job scheduler we're just
fetching that from the system again very

00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:29.360
fetching that from the system again very
 

00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:31.270
fetching that from the system again very
easy and then we create a job

00:24:31.270 --> 00:24:31.280
easy and then we create a job
 

00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:33.789
easy and then we create a job
info object and that needs some sort of

00:24:33.789 --> 00:24:33.799
info object and that needs some sort of
 

00:24:33.799 --> 00:24:35.560
info object and that needs some sort of
ID for the job so that your activity

00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:35.570
ID for the job so that your activity
 

00:24:35.570 --> 00:24:37.720
ID for the job so that your activity
knows what's going on but also the name

00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:37.730
knows what's going on but also the name
 

00:24:37.730 --> 00:24:39.010
knows what's going on but also the name
of the service so for the first time

00:24:39.010 --> 00:24:39.020
of the service so for the first time
 

00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:40.600
of the service so for the first time
we're not using an intent to rely on

00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:40.610
we're not using an intent to rely on
 

00:24:40.610 --> 00:24:42.580
we're not using an intent to rely on
we're just using the class name which we

00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:42.590
we're just using the class name which we
 

00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:45.159
we're just using the class name which we
get from the component name class and

00:24:45.159 --> 00:24:45.169
get from the component name class and
 

00:24:45.169 --> 00:24:46.360
get from the component name class and
then all of the conditions you care

00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:46.370
then all of the conditions you care
 

00:24:46.370 --> 00:24:47.680
then all of the conditions you care
about and I'll touch on that in just a

00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:47.690
about and I'll touch on that in just a
 

00:24:47.690 --> 00:24:49.450
about and I'll touch on that in just a
minute and then he just called scheduler

00:24:49.450 --> 00:24:49.460
minute and then he just called scheduler
 

00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:51.820
minute and then he just called scheduler
schedule with your job info very very

00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:51.830
schedule with your job info very very
 

00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:54.760
schedule with your job info very very
easy so the hard part is with job info

00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:54.770
easy so the hard part is with job info
 

00:24:54.770 --> 00:24:56.409
easy so the hard part is with job info
and these are like just some of the

00:24:56.409 --> 00:24:56.419
and these are like just some of the
 

00:24:56.419 --> 00:24:58.299
and these are like just some of the
offering as a job in front offers so

00:24:58.299 --> 00:24:58.309
offering as a job in front offers so
 

00:24:58.309 --> 00:24:59.799
offering as a job in front offers so
these I told you you could decide you

00:24:59.799 --> 00:24:59.809
these I told you you could decide you
 

00:24:59.809 --> 00:25:01.180
these I told you you could decide you
only care about certain criteria and

00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:01.190
only care about certain criteria and
 

00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:02.409
only care about certain criteria and
this is where you can set all of those

00:25:02.409 --> 00:25:02.419
this is where you can set all of those
 

00:25:02.419 --> 00:25:04.779
this is where you can set all of those
criteria when you're like worried about

00:25:04.779 --> 00:25:04.789
criteria when you're like worried about
 

00:25:04.789 --> 00:25:05.350
criteria when you're like worried about
your job

00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:05.360
your job
 

00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:07.899
your job
okay so couple these are pretty obvious

00:25:07.899 --> 00:25:07.909
okay so couple these are pretty obvious
 

00:25:07.909 --> 00:25:09.399
okay so couple these are pretty obvious
like you can create your own back off

00:25:09.399 --> 00:25:09.409
like you can create your own back off
 

00:25:09.409 --> 00:25:10.779
like you can create your own back off
and retry policy and then that'll be

00:25:10.779 --> 00:25:10.789
and retry policy and then that'll be
 

00:25:10.789 --> 00:25:11.919
and retry policy and then that'll be
used when we're rescheduling your job

00:25:11.919 --> 00:25:11.929
used when we're rescheduling your job
 

00:25:11.929 --> 00:25:14.260
used when we're rescheduling your job
for you you can create a minimum delay

00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:14.270
for you you can create a minimum delay
 

00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:16.990
for you you can create a minimum delay
before your job is run so if you say

00:25:16.990 --> 00:25:17.000
before your job is run so if you say
 

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.730
before your job is run so if you say
like I want to do this whenever I click

00:25:18.730 --> 00:25:18.740
like I want to do this whenever I click
 

00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:20.110
like I want to do this whenever I click
whenever Wi-Fi is on but I don't want to

00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:20.120
whenever Wi-Fi is on but I don't want to
 

00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:21.940
whenever Wi-Fi is on but I don't want to
do it until at least six hours from now

00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:21.950
do it until at least six hours from now
 

00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:23.470
do it until at least six hours from now
like that can be really helpful

00:25:23.470 --> 00:25:23.480
like that can be really helpful
 

00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:24.940
like that can be really helpful
especially if you're managing traffic

00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:24.950
especially if you're managing traffic
 

00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:28.510
especially if you're managing traffic
with your server we have an override

00:25:28.510 --> 00:25:28.520
with your server we have an override
 

00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:30.100
with your server we have an override
deadline so it's the maximum amount of

00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:30.110
deadline so it's the maximum amount of
 

00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:31.870
deadline so it's the maximum amount of
time that can pass before your job must

00:25:31.870 --> 00:25:31.880
time that can pass before your job must
 

00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:34.510
time that can pass before your job must
be run that's really helpful to like if

00:25:34.510 --> 00:25:34.520
be run that's really helpful to like if
 

00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:35.890
be run that's really helpful to like if
you you know that you have to get

00:25:35.890 --> 00:25:35.900
you you know that you have to get
 

00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:37.270
you you know that you have to get
something done today and it's gonna hit

00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:37.280
something done today and it's gonna hit

midnight or whatever persistent
 

00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:41.649
midnight or whatever persistent
indicates that you want to persist this

00:25:41.649 --> 00:25:41.659
indicates that you want to persist this
 

00:25:41.659 --> 00:25:44.020
indicates that you want to persist this
job request across the reboot a lot of

00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:44.030
job request across the reboot a lot of
 

00:25:44.030 --> 00:25:45.370
job request across the reboot a lot of
times like when your app is like started

00:25:45.370 --> 00:25:45.380
times like when your app is like started
 

00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:46.720
times like when your app is like started
for the first time then you know you

00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:46.730
for the first time then you know you
 

00:25:46.730 --> 00:25:48.159
for the first time then you know you
might change to your behavior but if you

00:25:48.159 --> 00:25:48.169
might change to your behavior but if you
 

00:25:48.169 --> 00:25:49.390
might change to your behavior but if you
know that you need this like after the

00:25:49.390 --> 00:25:49.400
know that you need this like after the
 

00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:51.789
know that you need this like after the
reboot but like that'll be that's a

00:25:51.789 --> 00:25:51.799
reboot but like that'll be that's a
 

00:25:51.799 --> 00:25:53.260
reboot but like that'll be that's a
great way to indicate it then we have

00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:53.270
great way to indicate it then we have
 

00:25:53.270 --> 00:25:54.490
great way to indicate it then we have
connectivity requirements it could be

00:25:54.490 --> 00:25:54.500
connectivity requirements it could be
 

00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:56.020
connectivity requirements it could be
you're waiting for any you network

00:25:56.020 --> 00:25:56.030
you're waiting for any you network
 

00:25:56.030 --> 00:25:57.850
you're waiting for any you network
metered or or not or maybe you're just

00:25:57.850 --> 00:25:57.860
metered or or not or maybe you're just
 

00:25:57.860 --> 00:25:59.799
metered or or not or maybe you're just
waiting for Wi-Fi specifically and so

00:25:59.799 --> 00:25:59.809
waiting for Wi-Fi specifically and so
 

00:25:59.809 --> 00:26:01.299
waiting for Wi-Fi specifically and so
you've got some constants in the class

00:26:01.299 --> 00:26:01.309
you've got some constants in the class
 

00:26:01.309 --> 00:26:02.950
you've got some constants in the class
that will help you specify that and then

00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:02.960
that will help you specify that and then
 

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:04.720
that will help you specify that and then
of course charging and our idle idle

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:04.730
of course charging and our idle idle
 

00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:06.299
of course charging and our idle idle
indicating that the screen is off

00:26:06.299 --> 00:26:06.309
indicating that the screen is off
 

00:26:06.309 --> 00:26:11.830
indicating that the screen is off
usually okay so this is this is the

00:26:11.830 --> 00:26:11.840
usually okay so this is this is the
 

00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:13.299
usually okay so this is this is the
magic of job scheduler this is like

00:26:13.299 --> 00:26:13.309
magic of job scheduler this is like
 

00:26:13.309 --> 00:26:16.720
magic of job scheduler this is like
where it happens and then we have this

00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:16.730
where it happens and then we have this
 

00:26:16.730 --> 00:26:19.299
where it happens and then we have this
hypothetical situation of you know like

00:26:19.299 --> 00:26:19.309
hypothetical situation of you know like
 

00:26:19.309 --> 00:26:22.419
hypothetical situation of you know like
do I just use one and I would say you

00:26:22.419 --> 00:26:22.429
do I just use one and I would say you
 

00:26:22.429 --> 00:26:26.320
do I just use one and I would say you
know no so what if you have a situation

00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:26.330
know no so what if you have a situation
 

00:26:26.330 --> 00:26:27.669
know no so what if you have a situation
where you user press as a share button

00:26:27.669 --> 00:26:27.679
where you user press as a share button
 

00:26:27.679 --> 00:26:28.750
where you user press as a share button
like it's off your intent service

00:26:28.750 --> 00:26:28.760
like it's off your intent service
 

00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:29.919
like it's off your intent service
because the share probably needs to

00:26:29.919 --> 00:26:29.929
because the share probably needs to
 

00:26:29.929 --> 00:26:30.940
because the share probably needs to
happen right away that's user initiated

00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:30.950
happen right away that's user initiated
 

00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:33.520
happen right away that's user initiated
but you're not actually online for some

00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:33.530
but you're not actually online for some
 

00:26:33.530 --> 00:26:35.380
but you're not actually online for some
reason like maybe it's a bad connection

00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:35.390
reason like maybe it's a bad connection
 

00:26:35.390 --> 00:26:37.210
reason like maybe it's a bad connection
or maybe you can release a HP so you

00:26:37.210 --> 00:26:37.220
or maybe you can release a HP so you
 

00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:38.799
or maybe you can release a HP so you
could then use your intense service to

00:26:38.799 --> 00:26:38.809
could then use your intense service to
 

00:26:38.809 --> 00:26:41.320
could then use your intense service to
schedule a job scheduled like a job

00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:41.330
schedule a job scheduled like a job
 

00:26:41.330 --> 00:26:42.639
schedule a job scheduled like a job
service for you right and then that way

00:26:42.639 --> 00:26:42.649
service for you right and then that way
 

00:26:42.649 --> 00:26:43.720
service for you right and then that way
you don't have to worry again about

00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:43.730
you don't have to worry again about
 

00:26:43.730 --> 00:26:45.879
you don't have to worry again about
keeping track of your own

00:26:45.879 --> 00:26:45.889
keeping track of your own
 

00:26:45.889 --> 00:26:47.620
keeping track of your own
back off for your own retry you don't

00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:47.630
back off for your own retry you don't
 

00:26:47.630 --> 00:26:49.450
back off for your own retry you don't
have to worry about like what's going on

00:26:49.450 --> 00:26:49.460
have to worry about like what's going on
 

00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:51.129
have to worry about like what's going on
you can just be like okay I failed when

00:26:51.129 --> 00:26:51.139
you can just be like okay I failed when
 

00:26:51.139 --> 00:26:52.539
you can just be like okay I failed when
I try to do it immediately the user

00:26:52.539 --> 00:26:52.549
I try to do it immediately the user
 

00:26:52.549 --> 00:26:53.529
I try to do it immediately the user
probably when I was since they're not on

00:26:53.529 --> 00:26:53.539
probably when I was since they're not on
 

00:26:53.539 --> 00:26:55.029
probably when I was since they're not on
internet anyway so let's just schedule

00:26:55.029 --> 00:26:55.039
internet anyway so let's just schedule
 

00:26:55.039 --> 00:26:56.950
internet anyway so let's just schedule
is for later and this is just one of

00:26:56.950 --> 00:26:56.960
is for later and this is just one of
 

00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:58.840
is for later and this is just one of
those things for like it's hard to teach

00:26:58.840 --> 00:26:58.850
those things for like it's hard to teach
 

00:26:58.850 --> 00:27:00.129
those things for like it's hard to teach
like how do you teach someone to

00:27:00.129 --> 00:27:00.139
like how do you teach someone to
 

00:27:00.139 --> 00:27:02.799
like how do you teach someone to
consider multiple different resources to

00:27:02.799 --> 00:27:02.809
consider multiple different resources to
 

00:27:02.809 --> 00:27:05.049
consider multiple different resources to
build the best possible behavior this is

00:27:05.049 --> 00:27:05.059
build the best possible behavior this is
 

00:27:05.059 --> 00:27:08.049
build the best possible behavior this is
one that like I was talking about my my

00:27:08.049 --> 00:27:08.059
one that like I was talking about my my
 

00:27:08.059 --> 00:27:09.399
one that like I was talking about my my
talking even was like well you know like

00:27:09.399 --> 00:27:09.409
talking even was like well you know like
 

00:27:09.409 --> 00:27:10.389
talking even was like well you know like
you should tell him about like fun

00:27:10.389 --> 00:27:10.399
you should tell him about like fun
 

00:27:10.399 --> 00:27:11.620
you should tell him about like fun
things I was like I didn't even think of

00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:11.630
things I was like I didn't even think of
 

00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:12.759
things I was like I didn't even think of
that like how do I stand up here and

00:27:12.759 --> 00:27:12.769
that like how do I stand up here and
 

00:27:12.769 --> 00:27:13.870
that like how do I stand up here and
teach people if I can't even think of

00:27:13.870 --> 00:27:13.880
teach people if I can't even think of
 

00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:15.700
teach people if I can't even think of
all these things and so it is hard and

00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:15.710
all these things and so it is hard and
 

00:27:15.710 --> 00:27:17.200
all these things and so it is hard and
that's why I really like when you know

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:17.210
that's why I really like when you know
 

00:27:17.210 --> 00:27:18.370
that's why I really like when you know
people share about this ghost because

00:27:18.370 --> 00:27:18.380
people share about this ghost because
 

00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:19.810
people share about this ghost because
like this would be a great situation and

00:27:19.810 --> 00:27:19.820
like this would be a great situation and
 

00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:20.830
like this would be a great situation and
it makes things so much easier for the

00:27:20.830 --> 00:27:20.840
it makes things so much easier for the
 

00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:22.180
it makes things so much easier for the
developer like you can use these kinds

00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:22.190
developer like you can use these kinds
 

00:27:22.190 --> 00:27:23.529
developer like you can use these kinds
of services not just to take work off

00:27:23.529 --> 00:27:23.539
of services not just to take work off
 

00:27:23.539 --> 00:27:26.200
of services not just to take work off
the main thread but also to make it so

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:26.210
the main thread but also to make it so
 

00:27:26.210 --> 00:27:27.610
the main thread but also to make it so
you don't have to build your own logic

00:27:27.610 --> 00:27:27.620
you don't have to build your own logic
 

00:27:27.620 --> 00:27:30.450
you don't have to build your own logic
that's been built 17,000 times already

00:27:30.450 --> 00:27:30.460
that's been built 17,000 times already
 

00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:33.549
that's been built 17,000 times already
okay so trying to teach you how to build

00:27:33.549 --> 00:27:33.559
okay so trying to teach you how to build
 

00:27:33.559 --> 00:27:35.049
okay so trying to teach you how to build
better apps and also not how to how to

00:27:35.049 --> 00:27:35.059
better apps and also not how to how to
 

00:27:35.059 --> 00:27:36.490
better apps and also not how to how to
not work very hard this is gonna be

00:27:36.490 --> 00:27:36.500
not work very hard this is gonna be
 

00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:38.860
not work very hard this is gonna be
really successful you guys the final

00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:38.870
really successful you guys the final
 

00:27:38.870 --> 00:27:40.360
really successful you guys the final
point I want to touch on is what about

00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:40.370
point I want to touch on is what about
 

00:27:40.370 --> 00:27:42.100
point I want to touch on is what about
actual alarms like those ones that go

00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:42.110
actual alarms like those ones that go
 

00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:43.240
actual alarms like those ones that go
ding ding ding and wake you up from your

00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:43.250
ding ding ding and wake you up from your
 

00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:43.509
ding ding ding and wake you up from your
nap

00:27:43.509 --> 00:27:43.519
nap
 

00:27:43.519 --> 00:27:46.509
nap
right if alarmmanager manages the other

00:27:46.509 --> 00:27:46.519
right if alarmmanager manages the other
 

00:27:46.519 --> 00:27:47.740
right if alarmmanager manages the other
alarms like how do you actually schedule

00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:47.750
alarms like how do you actually schedule
 

00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:49.210
alarms like how do you actually schedule
these like those seem really important

00:27:49.210 --> 00:27:49.220
these like those seem really important
 

00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:50.470
these like those seem really important
like do I have to like issue my own

00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:50.480
like do I have to like issue my own
 

00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:52.240
like do I have to like issue my own
sound notification or something every

00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:52.250
sound notification or something every
 

00:27:52.250 --> 00:27:54.430
sound notification or something every
time my alarm manager goes off and the

00:27:54.430 --> 00:27:54.440
time my alarm manager goes off and the
 

00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:56.230
time my alarm manager goes off and the
thing is no you don't because all our

00:27:56.230 --> 00:27:56.240
thing is no you don't because all our
 

00:27:56.240 --> 00:28:00.039
thing is no you don't because all our
manager has this super helpful set alarm

00:28:00.039 --> 00:28:00.049
manager has this super helpful set alarm
 

00:28:00.049 --> 00:28:02.560
manager has this super helpful set alarm
clock method and then of course you can

00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:02.570
clock method and then of course you can
 

00:28:02.570 --> 00:28:03.549
clock method and then of course you can
get the next time clock but that's

00:28:03.549 --> 00:28:03.559
get the next time clock but that's
 

00:28:03.559 --> 00:28:07.090
get the next time clock but that's
introduced in 21 clearly since I wrote

00:28:07.090 --> 00:28:07.100
introduced in 21 clearly since I wrote
 

00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:10.690
introduced in 21 clearly since I wrote
that on the thing so what's special

00:28:10.690 --> 00:28:10.700
that on the thing so what's special
 

00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:11.769
that on the thing so what's special
about these methods as they were
