Kind: captions
Language: en

00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.280
MALE SPEAKER: All right.

00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:04.240
So don't be shy.

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:06.690
Have some questions over there.

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.410
Otherwise, straight
to the raffle.

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:13.650
There's got to be
some questions.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.680
OK, there's an audience mic
over in the middle right here.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:20.910
Right there.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.020
Yeah, just go.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:22.600
Yeah.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.590
MALE SPEAKER: You
need to speak--

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:25.500
MALE SPEAKER: Walk up to the mic
and ask your Android question.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.244
AUDIENCE: I have to
speak into the mic.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.330
JAKE: Like a pirate, loudly.

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.896
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:00:32.896 --> 00:00:33.395
Jake.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.970
Promises in ServiceWorker, why
the Promise API in particular?

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:47.280
JAKE: Well, every API
from now on in the DOM

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.150
is, if it's async
success/failure, it's Promises.

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.650
That's it.

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.760
Callbacks are dead
for this stuff.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.810
Events are only valid
if it's an event,

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.470
if you get multiple of them.

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.730
So in some ways, things
like image loads,

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.084
yeah, that can happen
many times on one object.

00:01:04.084 --> 00:01:05.209
Everything is Promises now.

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:08.040
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.730
AUDIENCE: And a
ServiceWorker question.

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:14.600
So you said about the
traditional web cache

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.050
that the problem there
is that it competes

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.390
with all the stuff on
the web, basically.

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.290
And that's why
it's not effective.

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.820
But why is that not going to
happen to the ServiceWorker

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.910
cache once everybody
starts using it?

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.125
JAKE: At the moment, stuff
the ServiceWorker cache

00:01:30.125 --> 00:01:31.697
is only gone when you remove it.

00:01:31.697 --> 00:01:32.530
Like, it's reliable.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.390
There might be a
permissioning step

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.380
once you use a certain amount,
like over your free quota.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.860
But we want it to kind of be
the user's responsibility,

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:46.610
especially after they've
given permission,

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:47.500
to remove that stuff.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.289
Like if you go to a
website and it still

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:52.830
has some stuff in
the cache, and that

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.380
makes you run out of space, we
don't want it to go and delete

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.650
Netflix, the Netflix
site, and all the movies

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.130
that you've cached
for your flight.

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.750
So it's going to be like
the same as native apps.

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.260
We will promote
this stuff in here's

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.479
the sites that are using
the most disk space.

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.110
Which ones do you
want to remove?

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.240
AUDIENCE: And one more thing.

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.550
It seems very easy to register
to listen to push messages.

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.720
But how do I actually push
a message to your phone?

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.180
JAKE: Yeah, so you'll get an
ID and a URL in that object.

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.540
And that URL will be the
way you send the messages

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:30.510
to your server.

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.690
And that communication is going
to be standardized as well.

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.139
So even if you get an
Apple one or a Firefox one,

00:02:38.139 --> 00:02:40.430
the way you send the messages,
it will be standardized.

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.487
You will have to have
registered with that service,

00:02:43.487 --> 00:02:45.570
in the same way that you
do on Android and things.

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.790
Thank you.

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.530
It doesn't work with pale skin.

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.870
But yeah, so the same message,
but different endpoints.

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.890
MALE SPEAKER: Does anybody
else have a question for Jake?

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.130
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
actually not to Jake.

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.950
What's the biggest
thing standing

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.300
in the way for Android
performance and browser

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.260
performance with
garbage collection?

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.890
Which browser--

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.556
MALE SPEAKER: I heard Android, I
heard browser, I heard garbage.

00:03:10.556 --> 00:03:11.970
AUDIENCE: Garbage collection.

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.240
MALE SPEAKER: Hey, now.

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.140
AUDIENCE: Memory?

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.800
Memory?

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:15.350
Memory?

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:16.660
MALE SPEAKER: I'm just
reporting what I heard.

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:17.330
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:18.788
MALE SPEAKER: What
is the question?

00:03:18.788 --> 00:03:20.630
AUDIENCE: What's the
biggest things standing

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:23.690
in the way of better
performance on Android

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.890
and also mobile web
browser and Android?

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:27.830
What are those things?

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:31.070
Is it the VM doesn't
manage SSD memory fast?

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:32.440
Is it garbage collection?

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.060
Is it caching?

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.210
What's the biggest
things that you can't fix

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:37.979
or you're really stymied?

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:39.520
MALE SPEAKER:
Nothing's can't, right?

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.530
It's all just software.

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.300
So I would say the
biggest advance

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.260
that we've had recently
is ART, which is now

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.170
default, particularly
the L preview.

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:51.630
ART is not only default,
actually, it's the only.

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.870
So welcome to ART, which
improves garbage collection

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:56.370
greatly.

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.360
Actually, we talked
about it so much

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.750
in depth on the
Android developers

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.760
backstage podcast that we
went on to two episodes,

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.770
because we just kept
talking and talking.

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:09.082
So there's a lot of details
about why and how that works

00:04:09.082 --> 00:04:10.790
and how that improves
garbage collection.

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:13.170
There were a lot of
things about Dalvik

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.230
that were hampering performance
for garbage collection, just

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:17.959
how it was written
from the beginning

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.579
that we had a hard
time working with.

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:23.420
ART allowed us to
get beyond those

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:26.450
and allows garbage collection
to work much better

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:29.030
in general, parallel
garbage collection,

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.060
being able to move very
large objects like bitmaps

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.360
off the regular heap so
that everything else that's

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.992
very small can be collected
much more quickly.

00:04:36.992 --> 00:04:38.700
There's a lot of
optimizations that we've

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.110
been able to make
with ART, and I

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.370
think there's a lot more ground
to be covered there as well.

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.430
AUDIENCE: Is it
optomized for SSDs?

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.332
MALE SPEAKER: I can't
answer that question.

00:04:49.332 --> 00:04:50.415
AUDIENCE: I'll look it up.

00:04:50.415 --> 00:04:51.280
Don't worry about it.

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:52.071
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:04:52.071 --> 00:04:53.160
OK.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:57.015
JAKE: On the mobile web, we're
suffering from Paint, I'd say.

00:04:57.015 --> 00:04:58.700
But we're working
on that as well.

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:59.491
MALE SPEAKER: Cool.

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:03.490
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:04.880
Sorry, I'm showing
up a bit late,

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.500
so I don't know if this
question's been asked already.

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.890
MALE SPEAKER: Should we go
over the presentations again?

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:10.510
There were just four of us.

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:11.630
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:14.420
MALE SPEAKER: It'll take like
two hours, and we'll be done.

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:17.452
MALE SPEAKER: As
long as there's beer.

00:05:17.452 --> 00:05:18.408
AUDIENCE: Argh.

00:05:18.408 --> 00:05:19.370
Argh.

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:23.970
AUDIENCE:So I heard a talk a few
days ago about how Instagram,

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:26.820
they have part of their
app was using WebView.

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:28.900
And they switched from
WebView back to native.

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:29.650
MALE SPEAKER: Yay.

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.370
AUDIENCE: And I was
wondering-- oh, sorry.

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:32.494
Maybe I shouldn't ask this.

00:05:32.494 --> 00:05:34.660
But I was wondering how
can we, as developers,

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:37.200
plan for WebView
evolving as well?

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:43.370
Because we can't always depend
on Chrome features or Firefox.

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:46.150
MALE SPEAKER: So we do
have Chrome WebView.

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:47.366
So that's the answer.

00:05:47.366 --> 00:05:48.730
AUDIENCE: Ah, I see.

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:51.532
But then we have to depend
on Chrome being installed.

00:05:51.532 --> 00:05:52.240
MALE SPEAKER: No.

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:52.530
No.

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:54.113
So Chrome WebView
is a separate thing.

00:05:54.113 --> 00:05:56.470
It's basically a replacement
for the old WebView.

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:59.660
And you get all the benefits
of Chrome, the platform.

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:01.660
We're working on the
self-update story, as well.

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:03.785
So that's been a big pain
point for a lot of people

00:06:03.785 --> 00:06:04.760
to use in WebView.

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:06.700
So you're going to get
new features faster.

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:09.440
And we're still
working out the details

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:12.060
of how that upgrade
cycle's going to happen.

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:13.640
but it's there.

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.009
You can use it today.

00:06:15.009 --> 00:06:15.550
AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:17.850
So it's decoupled from the OS?

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:18.684
MALE SPEAKER: Right.

00:06:18.684 --> 00:06:19.225
AUDIENCE: Ah.

00:06:19.225 --> 00:06:19.750
Oh, sorry.

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:19.870
Thanks.

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:20.620
MALE SPEAKER: Yep.

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:21.400
Yep.

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:24.479
That was the big change.

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:25.020
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:27.850
I've got a question
about ServiceWorkers.

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:28.837
Yes, ServiceWorkers.

00:06:28.837 --> 00:06:30.300
Woo!

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:33.040
So I was wondering,
is there any work

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:36.470
being done to create a
polyfill for ServiceWorkers

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:37.950
on unsupported browsers?

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:40.410
Or would that even be possible?

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:42.529
Like would it be possible
to build ServiceWorkers

00:06:42.529 --> 00:06:43.320
on top of AppCache?

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:48.679
JAKE: Because of the
way the ordering of it

00:06:48.679 --> 00:06:51.220
is that it's more the other way
around, so that you can build

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:52.690
AppCache on top
of ServiceWorker,

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:55.760
because it's the lower level
thing with more freedom.

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:58.260
We did actually
build a polyfill,

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:01.250
but it was a node server
that acted as a proxy.

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:03.900
And all the ServiceWorker stuff
ran in the node environment.

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:06.380
And that wasn't for you can
use in production sites,

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:09.780
it was just a means for
us to test some stuff.

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:11.280
Yeah, the polyfills
are really going

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:13.681
to live in terms of things
like the cache API, which

00:07:13.681 --> 00:07:15.180
are hopefully going
to go away soon.

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:20.320
It would be interesting to
see if the Chrome for iOS

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:22.542
could patch some of this in
with their network stack.

00:07:22.542 --> 00:07:23.500
That would be exciting.

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:25.399
But it's not something
we've looked into yet.

00:07:25.399 --> 00:07:25.940
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:26.440
Thank you.

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:31.310
AUDIENCE: Just got a
question similar to what

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:32.800
somebody else was asking.

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:35.800
Just more to encourage
discussion amongst you guys

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:37.960
and see what you
guy's thoughts are

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:42.010
on the hybrid or mobile
web versus native.

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:48.190
And if we have all these
APIs, the HTML5 is opening up

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:50.780
all these native functionality,
push notification,

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:53.260
batteries, so forth,
it's bringing closer

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:56.540
to the native application
development environment.

00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:58.240
What will the future be?

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:01.410
More HTML5?

00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:02.570
Or a mixture?

00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:05.750
Because Facebook's app,
I think, some portions

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:07.575
still run on WebView.

00:08:07.575 --> 00:08:08.450
Most of it is native.

00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:12.029
So what is the
future looking like?

00:08:12.029 --> 00:08:14.320
MALE SPEAKER: I lost the
thread somewhere about halfway

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:14.819
through.

00:08:14.819 --> 00:08:18.295
Were you looking for a
rumble, or a group hug?

00:08:18.295 --> 00:08:18.920
AUDIENCE: Both.

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:24.379
MALE SPEAKER: So, I mean--

00:08:24.379 --> 00:08:25.670
MALE SPEAKER: Here, I'll do it.

00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:27.252
MALE SPEAKER: Like-- what-- OK.

00:08:27.252 --> 00:08:28.210
MALE SPEAKER: Do you--?

00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:28.710
OK.

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:30.620
So the politically
correct answer

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:33.030
here is that we are
in an increasingly

00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:34.900
device-heavy and mobile world.

00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:40.120
And as users want to experience
your content on these devices,

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:43.110
they expect them to have some
of the similar capabilities that

00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:45.070
are presented on the
devices themselves.

00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:47.380
So if you expect
that your platform is

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:50.860
going to continue to be
relevant on these devices,

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:54.760
you would expect that more of
the device-specific interfaces

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:56.770
are going to be
exposed over time.

00:08:56.770 --> 00:08:58.970
This is sort of the
conundrum that most of us

00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:01.890
sit in here, as someone
trying to bridge

00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:04.430
both worlds in this
kind of argument.

00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:06.140
As a developer, you
have to ask yourself

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:07.902
where you're investing
your source code,

00:09:07.902 --> 00:09:09.110
because that's the big thing.

00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:10.020
Do you write
everything in HTML5?

00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:11.230
Do you write it in Java?

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:12.360
Do you write it in C++?

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:14.750
Which you should be
writing everything in C++,

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:16.929
because I expect it.

00:09:16.929 --> 00:09:17.970
MALE SPEAKER: Only games.

00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:20.428
MALE SPEAKER: Only games.

00:09:20.428 --> 00:09:21.344
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:21.344 --> 00:09:22.310
MALE SPEAKER: Yes.

00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:25.670
But the truth is that, in an
increasingly mobile world,

00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:27.640
you should expect
that the web should

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:29.330
want to adapt to
that environment,

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:32.872
because that's what users
are immersed in right now.

00:09:32.872 --> 00:09:35.330
And for things to stay relevant
and things to move forward,

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:36.960
you have to expose
APIs in such a way

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:39.940
that users can get
attachment to that.

00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:43.030
That keeps Chet from
saying bad things.

00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:46.161
And I hope that keeps Jake
from saying bad things as well.

00:09:46.161 --> 00:09:48.410
MALE SPEAKER: Let me try
some positive things as well.

00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:52.221
So I think both platforms are
advancing on various fronts.

00:09:52.221 --> 00:09:54.720
We're making performance better,
both on the web and native.

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:55.580
And that's good.

00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:58.420
And if you just take
a longer term view,

00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:01.100
I think there shouldn't
be that difference.

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:03.190
You should be able to
build a really fast, nice,

00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:06.116
and fluid web app
and a native app.

00:10:06.116 --> 00:10:07.490
That shouldn't be
the difference.

00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:10.335
And the users don't care
if the experience is good.

00:10:10.335 --> 00:10:11.710
Then it really
becomes a question

00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:14.410
about what is the thing
that I'm trying to deliver?

00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:16.520
So for example, the
web really excels

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:18.770
at these ephemeral
experiences where

00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:20.870
I don't need to commit
to installing a thing,

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:26.160
and going through a complicated
opt-in process and check boxes.

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:28.190
I just want to check
if the ticket's

00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:29.931
available for this
freaking concert.

00:10:29.931 --> 00:10:30.430
Right?

00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:31.672
I don't need an app for that.

00:10:31.672 --> 00:10:33.880
That's a perfect use case
for something like the web.

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:35.089
Should that feel like an app?

00:10:35.089 --> 00:10:36.463
That shouldn't
make a difference.

00:10:36.463 --> 00:10:37.130
Right?

00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:40.680
So the context is
what matters there.

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:42.130
And I think we'll
find that that's

00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:43.963
where we're going to
be headed increasingly.

00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:48.360
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:51.070
So I'll just add one
final point which

00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:52.694
is, again, the context matters.

00:10:52.694 --> 00:10:54.860
It depends on what your
application is trying to do.

00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:56.930
If it's a migration
story from the web,

00:10:56.930 --> 00:10:58.180
that's a great place to start.

00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:01.950
If it's a really simple
application, or the UI

00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:04.600
that you are going for ties
in really closely with the way

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:07.240
you want to look on the web,
that's a great reason, too.

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:09.110
If it's a really
complicated app,

00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:10.870
and you want the
greatest performance,

00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:13.300
and you want it to look
like the rest of the things

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:15.340
on the native device,
that's the point

00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:20.430
at which you start considering
native as the real way to go.

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:23.220
Because these are still
constrained devices, right?

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:24.462
You have limited battery.

00:11:24.462 --> 00:11:25.420
You have limited power.

00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:26.480
You have limited performance.

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:28.813
And you need to do the right
thing for your application,

00:11:28.813 --> 00:11:32.340
so that it works well for
the user in that situation,

00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:34.900
not so that it works well for
the developer that didn't want

00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:37.410
to spend as much time
developing the application that

00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:38.100
worked well.

00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:40.100
It worked OK everywhere.

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:42.912
So do the thing that works
well for the platforms

00:11:42.912 --> 00:11:44.120
that you're trying to target.

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:45.740
JAKE: But in terms of the
developer spending time,

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:48.031
it's going to take you a lot
more time to do an iOS app

00:11:48.031 --> 00:11:49.640
and an Android app
than it's going

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:51.481
to do to build one
thing on the web.

00:11:51.481 --> 00:11:52.980
And then you've got
desktop as well.

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:53.600
MALE SPEAKER: Actually,
if you use C++,

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:54.975
you can get it on
both platforms.

00:11:54.975 --> 00:11:57.185
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:57.185 --> 00:12:01.500
[SCATTERED APPLAUSE]

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:04.320
MALE SPEAKER: You can look
awful everywhere with C++.

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:04.680
MALE SPEAKER: Is that what--

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:06.140
MALE SPEAKER: I think that's
what he was trying to say.

00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:07.160
No, absolutely.

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:09.450
That's exactly the
point is that I

00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:13.064
think the web is a solution for
everywhere is sort of the thing

00:12:13.064 --> 00:12:15.480
that you would think of first
and say, well, if I write it

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:18.620
in this, then it's basically
the same code everywhere.

00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:21.420
But is it the right
experience everywhere?

00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:21.990
Right?

00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:24.460
And for some
applications, absolutely.

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:26.635
For other applications,
there's more going on,

00:12:26.635 --> 00:12:29.260
or there's reasons that you want
to target native capabilities,

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:30.376
or whatever.

00:12:30.376 --> 00:12:32.750
And then that's the point at
which you want to say, well,

00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:35.060
is that the right solution?

00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:38.192
Or is there a mix of solutions
that we have a Chrome view

00:12:38.192 --> 00:12:39.650
and we have some
native components?

00:12:39.650 --> 00:12:42.270
Or we have all native
components, or all WebView?

00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:42.770
Whatever.

00:12:42.770 --> 00:12:43.561
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:12:43.561 --> 00:12:45.470
What the web needs to
do is to get to a point

00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:47.620
where the difference in
performance doesn't matter.

00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:49.270
Because this is
why we see things

00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:51.287
like Encarta not
happening anymore.

00:12:51.287 --> 00:12:52.870
You know, we see
things like Cinemania

00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:54.320
not happening anymore.

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:57.790
And having a native email
client, a lot of people

00:12:57.790 --> 00:13:00.750
don't anymore, because
although native can always

00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:03.440
beat the web in
terms of performance,

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:07.890
that performance difference
doesn't matter as much.

00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:09.860
So mobile, this is
why we see-- well,

00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:11.318
like I was saying
in my talk-- this

00:13:11.318 --> 00:13:13.180
is why we see much
native ruling on mobile,

00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:15.730
because that difference is
too great at the moment.

00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:17.060
But we're fixing it.

00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:17.684
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:13:17.684 --> 00:13:19.560
Thanks.

00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:20.560
MALE SPEAKER: Also, C++.

00:13:23.992 --> 00:13:25.200
I just wanted to get that in.

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:26.200
MALE SPEAKER: All right.

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:28.580
Are there any other
questions for Jake?

00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:29.795
Quick, quick, quick.

00:13:29.795 --> 00:13:31.420
AUDIENCE: I have no
questions for Jake.

00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:32.740
I have a question for Ilya.

00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:34.620
Actually, two questions.

00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:37.630
From your accent, I detect
that you're probably

00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:39.640
not from around these parts.

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:42.000
Where are you from originally?

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:42.990
AUDIENCE: Chico.

00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:45.030
AUDIENCE: Chico?

00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:46.030
MALE SPEAKER: That's it.

00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:47.460
That's what I'm going with.

00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:48.970
AUDIENCE: No, really.

00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:51.062
I was going to ask you.

00:13:51.062 --> 00:13:53.070
I think we all
anticipated you would

00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:57.882
speak like a pirate in the
Argot of your country of origin.

00:13:57.882 --> 00:13:58.590
Is that possible?

00:13:58.590 --> 00:13:59.590
AUDIENCE: He said Chico.

00:13:59.590 --> 00:14:01.040
AUDIENCE: Are you from the US?

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:01.390
AUDIENCE: He said Chico.

00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:02.240
MALE SPEAKER: No.

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:02.550
Chico.

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:03.425
AUDIENCE: It's Chico.

00:14:03.425 --> 00:14:05.800
AUDIENCE: You're from Chico,
which is not in the US?

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:06.508
MALE SPEAKER: No.

00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:11.200
I think I need a drink now.

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:12.908
AUDIENCE: I've already
had enough drinks.

00:14:12.908 --> 00:14:15.205
It's OK.

00:14:15.205 --> 00:14:16.362
No pirates?

00:14:16.362 --> 00:14:17.570
MALE SPEAKER: No, no pirates.

00:14:17.570 --> 00:14:18.320
AUDIENCE: Come on.

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:20.110
AUDIENCE: Call his bluff.

00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:21.610
[LAUGHS]

00:14:21.610 --> 00:14:23.110
AUDIENCE: Next.

00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:24.821
AUDIENCE: Har, C++ question.

00:14:24.821 --> 00:14:26.540
AUDIENCE: Yar.

00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:31.188
AUDIENCE: When Chromium
will migrate to C++ 11?

00:14:31.188 --> 00:14:32.556
AUDIENCE: C++.

00:14:32.556 --> 00:14:33.230
Yes.

00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:35.230
MALE SPEAKER: You mean
at the source code level,

00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:35.990
like Chromium?

00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:36.740
AUDIENCE: Yep.

00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:38.150
MALE SPEAKER: Does
that matter to you?

00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:38.941
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:14:38.941 --> 00:14:41.959
Is that like a big thing to how
you're-- so I'm guessing from

00:14:41.959 --> 00:14:44.250
that question that you're
writing some sort of plug-ins

00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:48.410
or interfaces, or working with
Chrome as a fork to roll it

00:14:48.410 --> 00:14:48.910
out.

00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:50.266
MALE SPEAKER: Is it
a religious thing?

00:14:50.266 --> 00:14:51.057
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:14:51.057 --> 00:14:52.889
MALE SPEAKER: I'm
trying to figure out.

00:14:52.889 --> 00:14:54.430
If you're writing
web apps, you don't

00:14:54.430 --> 00:14:55.888
care what's running
under the hood.

00:14:55.888 --> 00:14:57.860
If you're writing
mobile apps, maybe.

00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:00.930
But if you're writing plug-ins,
you should be using NaCl.

00:15:00.930 --> 00:15:03.250
AUDIENCE: It's just a
question of good taste.

00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:09.710
I know C++ 11 makes C++
code more, say, readable.

00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:12.210
MALE SPEAKER: So I'm going to
say that a lot of programmers

00:15:12.210 --> 00:15:15.190
have a lot of opinions.

00:15:15.190 --> 00:15:18.330
JAKE: No, they do not.

00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:20.580
MALE SPEAKER: And I think,
if you can look at the crew

00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:25.140
up here and realize that a
lot of opinions are personal,

00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:27.070
and then a lot of
opinions are political,

00:15:27.070 --> 00:15:29.060
and a lot of opinions
are handed down.

00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:29.350
MALE SPEAKER: Wrong.

00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:29.849
Wrong.

00:15:29.849 --> 00:15:32.320
MALE SPEAKER: Shut up.

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:35.350
Stow your noise.

00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:41.290
So trying to hypothesize
on whether or not

00:15:41.290 --> 00:15:43.210
a very successful
piece of software

00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:47.310
is going to migrate to
a minor change-- or even

00:15:47.310 --> 00:15:50.930
a major change-- in a
language for the sake

00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:54.120
simply of changing to it
is a lot of readability,

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:58.080
and a lot of rework, and a lot
of people, and a lot of time,

00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:00.730
and a lot of open source systems
that have to move around.

00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:01.480
Is it impossible?

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:01.870
No.

00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:04.090
But there's a lot of decisions,
and a lot of preferences,

00:16:04.090 --> 00:16:05.880
and a lot of politics,
and a lot of people

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:09.250
between where we are today and
where that decision might lie.

00:16:09.250 --> 00:16:12.890
AUDIENCE: So the answer
is you don't know.

00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:13.640
MALE SPEAKER: Yar.

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:15.624
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:15.624 --> 00:16:20.100
[SCATTERED APPLAUSE]

00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:22.240
MALE SPEAKER: So a
good place to ask

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:24.270
that same question
would be Blink Dev.

00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:26.550
So if you just go to
the group-- honestly,

00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:28.300
I'd encourage you to
just go there and ask

00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:30.320
that same question.

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:33.142
AUDIENCE: Just [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:33.142 --> 00:16:33.850
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:16:33.850 --> 00:16:37.320
Well, so that is the
right group of people.

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:39.370
Certainly, one of
the big motivations

00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:42.270
behind starting Blink, as
a project to begin with,

00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:45.200
was to be able to
decouple and fix

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:47.240
a lot of things, do clean
up, and all the rest.

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:48.380
There's ongoing projects.

00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:50.230
Just today, I was
reading a new proposal

00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:53.900
for doing a ton of clean
up in a render stack.

00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:58.600
So there's
initiatives like that.

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:02.290
Does that mean that
your particular flavor

00:17:02.290 --> 00:17:03.600
will be fixed tomorrow?

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:04.163
I don't know.

00:17:04.163 --> 00:17:05.079
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:17:07.590 --> 00:17:09.339
MALE SPEAKER: WebKit
has migrated already.

00:17:09.339 --> 00:17:10.255
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:10.255 --> 00:17:11.230
MALE SPEAKER: Good.

00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:13.387

00:17:13.387 --> 00:17:14.720

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:20.656
MALE SPEAKER: Do they
have ServiceWorker?

00:17:20.656 --> 00:17:21.640
MALE SPEAKER: No.

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:27.750
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:28.750
MALE SPEAKER: All right.

00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:31.430
Well, thanks for
all the questions.

00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:34.190
We want to have a big round of
applause for all four speakers.

00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:41.350

00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:42.350
MALE SPEAKER: All right.

00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:44.230
Just going to take a
couple of pictures,

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:47.078
and then we're going
to go on to the raffle.

00:17:47.078 --> 00:17:49.862

00:17:49.862 --> 00:17:52.190
MALE SPEAKER: Oh,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:55.200
MALE SPEAKER: So I want to make
sure that we thank everyone

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:57.770
properly, by the way,
for-- this one's mine.

00:17:57.770 --> 00:17:58.380
Fantastic.

00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:00.204
Guess what I'm doing tonight?

00:18:00.204 --> 00:18:02.620
So I want to make sure that
we thank the speakers properly

00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:04.810
and thank all of you here
for being here tonight.

00:18:04.810 --> 00:18:06.890
So I think we should
go for one more

00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:08.620
round of our "Perf
Matters to Me" song.

00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:09.370

MALE SPEAKER: Let's do it.

00:18:13.481 --> 00:18:14.480

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:15.737
Come on, speakers.

00:18:15.737 --> 00:18:17.070
