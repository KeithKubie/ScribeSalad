only part where got a little weak to me
 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.410
only part where got a little weak to me
was the ending where it feels like it

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420
was the ending where it feels like it
 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.819
was the ending where it feels like it
should have end at one part and then it

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829
should have end at one part and then it
 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.590
should have end at one part and then it
just kind of keeps going and gets a

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600
just kind of keeps going and gets a
 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.660

where we're doing this again kind of
 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.149
where we're doing this again kind of
thing and there's a little bit of a

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159
thing and there's a little bit of a
 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.700

then it's still kind of looking for its
 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.550
then it's still kind of looking for its
footing but then like when the actual

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560
footing but then like when the actual
 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.940
footing but then like when the actual
plot gets going when the you know server

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950
plot gets going when the you know server
 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.590

adrenaline-pumping

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600
adrenaline-pumping
 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.240
adrenaline-pumping
story gets going where everyone's kind

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250
story gets going where everyone's kind
 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.820
story gets going where everyone's kind
of after um it gets good and it gets fun

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830
of after um it gets good and it gets fun
 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.280
of after um it gets good and it gets fun
and it turns out to be a

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290
and it turns out to be a
 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.589
and it turns out to be a
a surprisingly good follow-up even

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599
a surprisingly good follow-up even
 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:16.640
a surprisingly good follow-up even
though the story gets a lot more

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650
though the story gets a lot more
 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.080
though the story gets a lot more
complicated and the frizzen was so

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090
complicated and the frizzen was so
 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.240
complicated and the frizzen was so
simple so it was very very smart about

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250
simple so it was very very smart about
 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.929
simple so it was very very smart about
that and now we have the third one where

00:02:23.929 --> 00:02:23.939
that and now we have the third one where
 

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:25.429
that and now we have the third one where
the middle is where it kind of gets lost

00:02:25.429 --> 00:02:25.439
the middle is where it kind of gets lost
 

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:27.949
the middle is where it kind of gets lost
and I think that's so funny

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959
and I think that's so funny
 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.610
and I think that's so funny
it starts off ridiculously strong like I

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690
the fury road of like these kind of
 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.920
the fury road of like these kind of
martial arts gun movies and then it kind

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930
martial arts gun movies and then it kind
 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.780
martial arts gun movies and then it kind
of levels out and again it gets a little

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790
of levels out and again it gets a little
 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.030
of levels out and again it gets a little
lost there's even a scene where somebody

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040
