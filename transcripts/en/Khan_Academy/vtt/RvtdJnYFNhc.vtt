00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:03.080
Let's get started and
learn how to convert

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:04.430
percentages to decimals.

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:07.000
And if we have time maybe we'll
also learn how to convert

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.840
decimals into percentages.

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.700
So let's get started with what
I think is a problem you

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.060
probably already
know how to do.

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:14.930
If I said I have 50%.

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.520
I don't know if I wanted
to write that thick,

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:20.630
but we'll go with it.

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.420
Actually, let me change
it to a thinner one.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.450
And I want to turn
that into a decimal.

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:26.580
Well you probably already
have a sense of what

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.940
decimal represents 50%.

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.790
If I told you we're having a
sale and it's 50% off you know

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:34.270
that's roughly half off, or
another way, how do you

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:35.870
say half as a decimal?

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:44.240
Well that's the same thing as
0.5 So you might have known

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.150
that in your head, but is there
a system for being able to

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:49.990
convert this 50% to 0.5?

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:52.770
Well, it turns out it's
pretty straightforward.

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.590
All you do is you say--
whatever percentage it is,

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:03.760
that's the same thing
as the number over 100.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:13.772
And 50/100 is the same
thing as 5/10 or 0.5.

00:01:13.772 --> 00:01:17.250
Now even a simpler way of
converting percentage to

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.620
decimals and, I think, you're
going to realize converting a

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.170
percentage to a decimal or the
other way around, you can

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.800
pretty much do it in your head.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.180
If I say, let's say 50-- and
I'm just going to add one

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:34.170
decimal of accuracy here just
to show you a point-- 50.0%.

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.640
If I want to convert that 50.0%
into a decimal, all I do is I

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.900
get rid of the percent sign.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.320
So I'll do it here.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.500
50.0%.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.100
I get rid of the percent sign
and I take the decimal point

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.960
and I move it over two
spaces to the left.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.590
So I say 1, 2.

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.580
So this is where the
new decimal is.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:05.260
So this equals we
could say 0.500.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:10.560
So 50.0% is equal to 0.500.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.170
And of course, these last two
0's really don't mean anything

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.640
for our purposes, so
we'll get rid of them.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:22.310
So that's the same thing
as 0.5 or just 0.5.

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.290
50% equals 0.5.

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.810
So you're probably
saying, well, sure.

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.200
That looks easy, but what
if the problem gets

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.700
a little harder?

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.110
50% I could have
done in my head.

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:35.080
So let's try some, I would say,
slightly harder problems.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:46.240
If I were to tell you
that-- let's say 16.32%.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.100
Well, let's just do it the
way I just showed you.

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.200
I'll rewrite it down here.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:56.520
16.32%.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.610
So if we get rid of the percent
sign, scratch it out, we just

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.740
have to move the decimal over
two spaces to the left.

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.830
So 1, 2.

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.250
This is the new place
for the decimal.

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:10.580
That decimal goes away.

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:23.340
So it's 0.1632 is
equal to 16.32%.

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:24.850
I think you might be
getting the idea now.

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.310
Let me do another one in green.

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.910
Let's say I had-- and this
one actually confuses

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:32.540
a lot of people.

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:41.830
Let's say I had 0.25%.

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.950
So the important thing to
remember is, I'll rewrite here.

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:53.170
0.25-- and maybe I'll write
00.-- And you're probably

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.260
wondering why I'm doing this,
but I think you'll see in a

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.100
second why I wrote that leading
0 there even though it doesn't

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.020
seem to add much to it.

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:01.630
00.25%.

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:03.250
Well, what's the system
I just showed you?

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.570
You get rid of the percent
sign and you move the

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:10.000
decimal over 1, 2 spaces.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.600
So that equals 0.0025.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:20.380
So 0.25% is equal to 0.0025.

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.480
And you could put a leading
0 here if you want.

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.090
Actually, I should probably
tell you to always do that

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.260
because it makes it
easier to read.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:34.050
So 0.25% is equal to 0.0025.

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.270
And I want to just
contrast that with 25%.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.250
25%, what do you
think that equals?

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.920
Well.

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.970
you do the same thing
that we've been doing.

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:51.680
You get rid of the percent sign
and you move the decimal space.

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.220
In this case-- actually,
let me leave that there.

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:53.800
I'll just rewrite it here.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:54.130
25%.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.320
And you're probably saying,
where is the decimal in this?

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.213
Well, the decimal is after the
number because that 25% is

00:05:02.213 --> 00:05:04.560
the same thing as 25.0%.

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.510
So if we get rid of the percent
sign, we move the decimal over

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:16.550
two spaces to the left, and
that equals 0.25 as a decimal,

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.220
or 0.250, but we can
ignore that last 0.

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:29.280
So 25% equals 0.25 while
0.25% is equal to 0.0025.

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.970
And I want you to maybe sit
and think about how small

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:35.390
of a number 0.25% is.

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:37.910
Let's do a couple more and
maybe we'll convert going

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:38.510
the other direction.

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:48.820
Let's say I have the decimal
0.01 and I wanted to convert

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:49.860
that into a percent.

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:58.120
Well, here we just
do it the opposite.

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.550
We could look at it two ways.

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:03.870
We could say well, whatever
number this is, we multiply it

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:06.180
by 100 and add a percent sign.

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:12.770
So if you say 0.01 times
100, and then we'll

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:15.590
add a percent sign.

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:15.750
So a.

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:17.150
0.01 times 100?

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:18.740
Well that's just 1.

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:20.420
You could do the math.

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:21.380
You add the percent sign.

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:23.550
Well, that equals 1%.

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:27.930
Or an even easier way, when we
go from a percent to a decimal,

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:31.770
we move the decimal place
over two to the left.

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:33.930
So when you go from a
decimal to a percent,

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:35.160
we'll do the opposite.

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:37.250
We move the decimal
two to the right.

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:40.680
So if we do that, let
me just rewrite it.

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.420
0.01.

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:44.960
Just go 1, 2.

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.180
The new decimal place is here.

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:54.530
If I get rid of that decimals
that's 01 decimal 00 whatever.

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:56.610
Obviously, this leading 0
means nothing, so that's

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:58.830
the same thing as 1.00.

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:02.260
Which is the same thing as 1.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:07.080
And does it make sense that
moving the decimal space two to

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:09.580
the right-- that's really just
the same thing as multiplying

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:11.720
it by 100, right?

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:15.070
If I multiply something by 10
it's like moving the decimal

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:16.990
space one to the right.

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:20.720
If I divide something by
10 it's like moving the

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:22.230
decimal space one to left.

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:24.320
Let's do a couple more
while I have time.

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:27.630
I think I have three
more minutes.

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:36.390
Let's say I had 1.25 and
I wanted to convert

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:37.810
that to a percent.

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:41.380
Well, the easiest way is just
to take-- I'll rewrite it here.

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:43.200
1.25.

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:47.120
Take the decimal point,
move it two to the right.

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:49.190
That's here.

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:50.220
And then I'll add a percent.

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:55.460
So that equals 125%.

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:57.100
And if you think about it,
the way people talk about

00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:58.260
percent it makes sense.

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:04.700
If I told you that I'm going
to pay 1.25 times the

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:06.150
price of something.

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:07.860
That makes sense that that's
also I'm going to pay

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:09.960
125% of the price.

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:12.330
Or if it doesn't make sense
hopefully if you do these

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:14.630
problems enough it will
start to make sense.

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:15.690
Let's do a couple of more.

00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:17.940
And you can go back and pause
this if you think I'm going too

00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:19.380
fast, which I might be doing.

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:27.680
Let me think.

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:35.920
If I were to say 0.003
and I want to write

00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:39.520
this as a percent.

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:43.450
Well, once again, we can
move the decimal space

00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:45.010
two to the right.

00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:46.510
So 1, 2.

00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:49.830
And that's analogous to
multiplying it by 100.

00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:53.350
So if we multiply the decimal
two to the right we get

00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:57.120
00 decimal point 3.

00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:00.080
And then we add the percent.

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:01.860
At least this first leading 0
doesn't mean anything, so

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:03.150
that's the same thing as 0.3%.

00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:09.180
The important thing to realize
is when you're converting from

00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:12.550
a percent to a decimal or a
decimal to a percent, you're

00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:15.000
really just moving where
that decimal point is.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.490
And if you run out of spaces
you just have to add or get

00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:20.460
rid of 0's accordingly.

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:23.070
And the important thing to
always have in your mind is,

00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:27.260
when I convert from a decimal
to a percent, the number in

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.230
front of percent signs
going to get bigger.

00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:31.590
And when I go from a percent
sign to a decimal, I'm going

00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:33.920
to get a smaller number.

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:41.880
If I say 25%, that's the
same thing as 0.25.

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:44.430
So this is a percent,
and this is a decimal.

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:52.080
So I went from a bigger number,
25, to a smaller number, 0.25.

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:54.570
25% is equal to 0.25.

00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:59.840
Similarly, if I had a
decimal, let's say 0.1.

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:01.660
When I convert it to a
percentage it's going to

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:03.300
be a larger percentage.

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:08.060
So 0.1 is the same
thing as 10%.

00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:10.430
And how did I do that again?

00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:14.310
Well I said 0.1, I added an
extra 0 because I'm going to

00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:16.850
have to move the decimal space
over to the right twice.

00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:20.790
So I go 1, 2, and I get a 10.

00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:22.730
