00:00:00.322 --> 00:00:01.544
- [Instructor] What I want
you to do in this video

00:00:01.544 --> 00:00:03.208
is a little bit more of a deep dive

00:00:03.208 --> 00:00:06.064
into the House of Representatives.

00:00:06.064 --> 00:00:07.890
Now we've already talked about how either

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.367
chamber of Congress can
introduce general legislation.

00:00:11.367 --> 00:00:13.212
And if it gets approved by one chamber,

00:00:13.212 --> 00:00:16.227
it has to be voted on and
approved by the other chamber.

00:00:16.227 --> 00:00:17.594
But the House of Representatives

00:00:17.594 --> 00:00:20.512
has some specific constitutional powers.

00:00:20.512 --> 00:00:23.917
So for example, impeachment proceedings

00:00:23.917 --> 00:00:27.136
would start in the House
of Representatives.

00:00:27.136 --> 00:00:28.888
In other videos we have talked about

00:00:28.888 --> 00:00:30.735
impeachment is not the
removal from office,

00:00:30.735 --> 00:00:34.593
of say the president, it is
just a formal indictment.

00:00:34.593 --> 00:00:36.779
Now if the House of representatives

00:00:36.779 --> 00:00:39.870
is able to impeach
someone, say the president,

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.174
then it would go to the
Senate to try the impeachment,

00:00:43.174 --> 00:00:46.935
to decide whether to
actually convict the person.

00:00:46.935 --> 00:00:48.810
Now we've also talked about the House

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:53.195
being the place where tax and
revenue bills would initiate.

00:00:53.195 --> 00:00:56.131
So if we're talking about tax or revenue,

00:00:56.131 --> 00:00:59.628
these bills would start in
the House of Representatives.

00:00:59.628 --> 00:01:02.205
The other areas where the
Senate has more influence

00:01:02.205 --> 00:01:06.013
by the Constitution are
in ratifying treaties,

00:01:06.013 --> 00:01:08.168
and this is really one
of the significant levers

00:01:08.168 --> 00:01:11.005
where the Senate has more
influence on foreign policy,

00:01:11.005 --> 00:01:14.271
and also confirmation of
presidential appointments,

00:01:14.271 --> 00:01:15.572
either into the executive branch

00:01:15.572 --> 00:01:17.103
if we're talking about the cabinet,

00:01:17.103 --> 00:01:19.533
or judicial appointments,
the federal court system

00:01:19.533 --> 00:01:22.380
including the US Supreme Court.

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.723
But beyond these constitutional powers,

00:01:24.723 --> 00:01:28.077
there's differences in how
these different houses are run.

00:01:28.077 --> 00:01:30.200
And what we'll see is
these processes result

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.972
in the Senate being more deliberative.

00:01:32.972 --> 00:01:36.638
In the video on filibuster,
we talk about how hard it is

00:01:36.638 --> 00:01:38.922
to end the debate in the Senate.

00:01:38.922 --> 00:01:42.756
While in the House, the
power is more centralized

00:01:42.756 --> 00:01:45.391
amongst not just the majority party,

00:01:45.391 --> 00:01:48.123
but amongst the leadership
in that majority party.

00:01:48.123 --> 00:01:50.198
We're talking about folks
like the Speaker of the House,

00:01:50.198 --> 00:01:52.877
and the inner circle of
the Speaker of the House.

00:01:52.877 --> 00:01:55.078
And we'll see why this is in a second.

00:01:55.078 --> 00:01:57.471
And to appreciate this centralized power,

00:01:57.471 --> 00:01:58.978
and you could argue a more efficient

00:01:58.978 --> 00:02:02.047
versus deliberative process in
the House of Representatives,

00:02:02.047 --> 00:02:04.428
you just have to remember
that if we have a bill

00:02:04.428 --> 00:02:08.329
coming to the House, it will
first go to the Speaker,

00:02:08.329 --> 00:02:11.083
who decides which committee it goes to.

00:02:11.083 --> 00:02:12.390
So let's say it goes to

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.263
some type of a committee right over here.

00:02:16.263 --> 00:02:17.709
Now just as in the Senate,

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:19.547
this committee can conduct hearings,

00:02:19.547 --> 00:02:21.071
they can have some debate,

00:02:21.071 --> 00:02:23.280
and the leadership of
the committee can decide

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.871
to bring it to the House floor.

00:02:25.871 --> 00:02:27.535
But in reality, what happens is

00:02:27.535 --> 00:02:30.762
is that the Rules Committee gets involved.

00:02:30.762 --> 00:02:33.505
And as we've talked
about in previous videos,

00:02:33.505 --> 00:02:35.292
the Rules Committee in the House

00:02:35.292 --> 00:02:37.774
has a significant amount of power.

00:02:37.774 --> 00:02:41.231
They can decide, assuming a
bill gets through committee,

00:02:41.231 --> 00:02:43.051
they can decide to what degree

00:02:43.051 --> 00:02:44.873
it is debated on the House floor.

00:02:44.873 --> 00:02:47.320
They can even decide on
the rules of debating.

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.174
They could decide on the House floor,

00:02:50.174 --> 00:02:52.571
is it going to be debated as the House,

00:02:52.571 --> 00:02:56.738
or is it going to be debated
as the Committee of the Whole?

00:02:58.006 --> 00:03:00.750
Which happens in the House chamber,

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.508
but in this situation,
the House discusses it

00:03:04.508 --> 00:03:07.142
as a very, very, very large committee.

00:03:07.142 --> 00:03:10.169
And it's usually done for
very important legislation,

00:03:10.169 --> 00:03:12.324
or even sometimes complex legislation

00:03:12.324 --> 00:03:15.317
where they want to pass it
in a more efficient way.

00:03:15.317 --> 00:03:18.031
And so the existence of a
very powerful Rules Committee,

00:03:18.031 --> 00:03:19.654
you have a Rules Committee in the Senate,

00:03:19.654 --> 00:03:21.204
but they really don't have much power.

00:03:21.204 --> 00:03:22.777
But in the House of Representatives,

00:03:22.777 --> 00:03:25.111
some would argue that they
are the most important

00:03:25.111 --> 00:03:26.756
or most powerful committee,

00:03:26.756 --> 00:03:30.046
because they decide how and
when things get debated.

00:03:30.046 --> 00:03:31.962
They even decide if there is a debate,

00:03:31.962 --> 00:03:34.642
or their amendments can
even be added to bills.

00:03:34.642 --> 00:03:36.749
Remember, in our discussion of the Senate,

00:03:36.749 --> 00:03:39.667
once something even goes
to the Senate floor,

00:03:39.667 --> 00:03:41.651
it's still open to filibuster,

00:03:41.651 --> 00:03:45.756
and you still need those 60
votes for closure on a bill.

00:03:45.756 --> 00:03:48.788
That is not the case in the
House of Representatives.

00:03:48.788 --> 00:03:52.074
Now in theory, there are some mechanisms

00:03:52.074 --> 00:03:55.095
where someone could bypass some of this.

00:03:55.095 --> 00:03:56.279
So for example,

00:03:56.279 --> 00:03:58.799
in a committee in the
House of Representatives,

00:03:58.799 --> 00:03:59.752
just as in the Senate,

00:03:59.752 --> 00:04:01.901
the leadership of a committee could decide

00:04:01.901 --> 00:04:03.696
to not bring something to vote.

00:04:03.696 --> 00:04:07.000
They could just put a bill
into limbo, not debate it.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.025
But if someone really wants
it to come to the House floor,

00:04:10.025 --> 00:04:13.877
they could use something
called a discharge petition.

00:04:13.877 --> 00:04:14.710
Discharge

00:04:17.442 --> 00:04:18.275
petition.

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:21.943
But in order to get a discharge petition,

00:04:21.943 --> 00:04:23.269
in order to make it successful

00:04:23.269 --> 00:04:25.873
so that that bill actually
goes through the House floor

00:04:25.873 --> 00:04:29.743
even if the committee chairman
doesn't want it to go there,

00:04:29.743 --> 00:04:33.864
it has to get a majority
vote of representatives.

00:04:33.864 --> 00:04:34.697
And so you could imagine,

00:04:34.697 --> 00:04:36.607
if it's someone from a minority party

00:04:36.607 --> 00:04:39.560
trying to have a discharge petition,

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:40.597
it would be very difficult,

00:04:40.597 --> 00:04:42.622
because how are they going to get 51%

00:04:42.622 --> 00:04:46.463
of the 435 representatives to vote for it.

00:04:46.463 --> 00:04:48.241
And so that's why in practice,

00:04:48.241 --> 00:04:51.374
this is actually not that typical.

00:04:51.374 --> 00:04:55.562
So the big picture here, beyond
the constitutional powers

00:04:55.562 --> 00:04:57.540
that are given to the House or the Senate,

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:59.641
in general, the House of Representatives

00:04:59.641 --> 00:05:01.529
is much more hierarchical.

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:03.007
The power is centralized,

00:05:03.007 --> 00:05:05.035
especially within the majority party.

00:05:05.035 --> 00:05:06.834
And because of that centralized power,

00:05:06.834 --> 00:05:10.742
it allows the House to get
bills moving much faster,

00:05:10.742 --> 00:05:13.285
especially once they go
through the House floor.

00:05:13.285 --> 00:05:15.521
You don't have this
notion of a filibuster,

00:05:15.521 --> 00:05:17.957
and this notion that you
have to get a super majority

00:05:17.957 --> 00:05:21.430
in order to actually get a
vote and get something passed.
