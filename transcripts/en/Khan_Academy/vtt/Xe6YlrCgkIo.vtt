00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.240
So we have got a very
interesting scenario here.

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.730
I have this conical thimble-like
cup that is 4 centimeters high.

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.450
And also, the diameter
of the top of the cup

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:13.450
is also 4 centimeters.

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:16.480
And I'm pouring water
into this cup right now.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.560
And I'm pouring the water at
a rate of 1 cubic centimeter.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.800
1 cubic centimeter per second.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.130
And right at this
moment, there is a height

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.930
of 2 centimeters of water
in the cup right now.

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.070
So the height right now from the
bottom of the cup to this point

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.230
right over here
is 2 centimeters.

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.980
So my question to you
is, at what rate--

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.700
we know the rate at which the
water is flowing into the cup,

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.390
we're being given
a volume per time.

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.550
My question to you is
right at this moment,

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.270
right when we are
filling our cup

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.660
at 1 cubic centimeter
per second.

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.910
And we have exactly
2 centimeters

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.200
of water in the cup,
2 centimeters deep

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.580
of water in the cup,
what is the rate at which

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.770
the height of the
water is changing?

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.540
What is the rate at which
this height right over here

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:06.440
is actually changing?

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.902
We know it's 2 centimeters,
but how fast is it changing?

00:01:10.902 --> 00:01:12.610
Well let's think about
this a little bit.

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:13.877
What are we being given?

00:01:13.877 --> 00:01:15.960
We're given-- we are being
given the rate at which

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.530
the volume of the water is
changing with respect to time.

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:20.740
So let's write that down.

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.290
We are being given the rate at
which the volume of the water

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.900
is changing with
respect to time,

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:34.630
and we're told that this is 1
cubic centimeter per second.

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.440
And what are we
trying to figure out?

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.810
Well we're trying to
figure out how fast

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.330
the height of the water is
changing with respect to time.

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.550
We know that the height
right now is 2 centimeters.

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.560
But what we want to
figure out is the rate

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.300
at which the height is
changing with respect to time.

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.060
If we can figure
out this, then we

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.880
have essentially
answered the question.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.620
So one way that we
can do this is we

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.530
can come up with the
relationship between the volume

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.704
at any moment in time and the
height at any moment in time.

00:02:02.704 --> 00:02:04.120
And then maybe
take the derivative

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.870
of that relationship,
possibly using the chain rule,

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.684
to come up with a relationship
between the rate at which

00:02:09.684 --> 00:02:12.100
the volume is changing and the
rate at which the height is

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.250
changing.

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.900
So let's try to do
it step by step.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.024
So first of all, can we
come up with a relationship

00:02:17.024 --> 00:02:21.220
between the volume and the
height at any given moment?

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.550
Well we have also
been given the formula

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.690
for the volume of a
cone right over here.

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.480
The volume of a cone
is 1/3 times the area

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.485
of the base of the
cone, times the height.

00:02:30.485 --> 00:02:32.110
And we won't prove
it here, although we

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.110
could prove it later on.

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.330
Especially when we start
doing solids of revolutions

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.700
within in integral calculus.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.450
But we'll just take
it on faith right now,

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.340
that this is how we can figure
out the volume of a cone.

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.280
So given this can we
figure out volume--

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.710
can we figure out an
expression that relates volume

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.470
to the height of the cone?

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.200
Well we could say
that volume-- and I'll

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.380
do it in this blue color--
the volume of water

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:57.980
is what we really care about.

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.740
The volume of water
is going to be

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:07.950
equal to 1/3 times the area
of the surface of the water--

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:16.890
area of water surface-- times
our height of the water.

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.710
So times h.

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:21.010
So how can we figure out the
area of the water surface,

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.320
preferably in terms of h?

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.290
Well we see right over
here, the diameter

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.920
across the top of the
cone is 4 centimeters.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.840
And the height of the
whole cup is 4 centimeters.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.600
And so that ratio is
going to be true of any--

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.100
at any depth of water.

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.100
It's always going to have the
same ratio between the diameter

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.140
across the top and the height.

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.230
Because these are
lines right over here.

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.290
So at any given point, the
ratio between this and this

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:48.420
is going to be the same.

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.530
So at any given
point, the diameter

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.500
across the surface of the
water-- if the depth is h,

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.370
the diameter across the
surface of the water

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.690
is also going to be h.

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.112
And so from that
we can figure out

00:03:59.112 --> 00:04:00.570
what are the radius
is going to be.

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:02.730
The radius is going
to be h over 2.

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.060
And so the area of
the water surface

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:10.500
is going to be pi r squared,
pi times the radius squared.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.490
h over 2 squared.

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:15.670
That's the area of the
surface of the water.

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:17.810
And of course we still
have the 1/3 out here.

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.980
And we're still multiplying
by this h over here.

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:23.900
So let me see if I
can simplify this.

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:33.530
So this gives us 1/3 times pi h
squared over 4 times another h,

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:42.350
which is equal to-- we have pi,
h to the third power over 12.

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:45.600
So that is our volume.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.930
Now what we want to do is relate
the volume, how fast the volume

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:50.510
is changing with
respect to time,

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:53.210
and how fast the height is
changing with respect to time.

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.877
So we care with respect to
time, since we care so much

00:04:55.877 --> 00:04:57.710
about what's happening
with respect to time,

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.290
let's take the derivative of
both sides of this equation

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:01.529
with respect to time.

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:03.820
To do that, and just so I
have enough space to do that,

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.240
let me move this over.

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.420
Let me move this over to
the right a little bit.

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:10.580
So I just move this
over to the right.

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:13.310
And so now we can take the
derivative with respect

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:16.350
to time of both sides
of this business.

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:21.010
So the derivative with
respect to time of our volume

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:24.839
and the derivative with respect
to time of this business.

00:05:24.839 --> 00:05:27.130
Well the derivative with
respect to time of our volume,

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:30.850
we could just rewrite that as dV
dt, this thing right over here.

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:36.850
This is dV dt, and
this is going to be

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:39.404
equal to-- well we could
take the constants out

00:05:39.404 --> 00:05:41.320
of this-- this is going
to be equal to pi over

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:52.300
12 times the derivative
with respect to t of h, of h

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:55.620
to the third power.

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:57.930
And just so that the
next few things I do

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:59.539
will appear a
little bit clearer,

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:01.580
we're assuming that height
is a function of time.

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:02.780
In fact, it's definitely
a function of time.

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:04.750
As time goes on, the
height will change.

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:06.960
Because we're pouring
more and more water here.

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.210
So instead of just writing
h to the third power, which

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:12.770
I could write over here,
let me write h of t

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:13.620
to the third power.

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:16.822
Just to make it clear that
this is a function of t.

00:06:16.822 --> 00:06:21.160
h of t to the third power.

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.430
Now what is the derivative
with respect to t,

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:26.300
of h of t to the third power.

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:28.190
Now, you might be getting
a tingling feeling

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:31.710
that the chain rule
might be applicable here.

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:33.846
So let's think about
the chain rule.

00:06:33.846 --> 00:06:36.220
The chain rule tells us-- let
me rewrite everything else.

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:43.070
dV with respect to t, is going
to be equal to pi over 12,

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:45.320
times the derivative of
this with respect to t.

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:47.570
If we want to take the
derivative of this with respect

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:49.630
to t, we have something
to the third power.

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:52.580
So we want to take the
derivative of something

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:54.750
to the third power with
respect to something.

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:56.670
So that's going to
be-- let me write

00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:59.350
this in a different color,
maybe in orange-- so that's

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:06.460
going to be 3 times
our something squared,

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:11.840
times the derivative of that
something, with respect to t.

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:21.770
Times dh-- I've already used
that pink-- times dh dt.

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:23.250
Let's just be very clear.

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:25.610
This orange term right
over here-- and I'm

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:32.760
just using the chain rule--
this is the derivative of h of t

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:38.550
to the third power
with respect to h of t.

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:41.990
And then we're going to multiply
that times the derivative of h

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:46.520
of t with respect to t.

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:48.290
And then that gives
us the derivative

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:52.081
of this entire thing, h of t to
the third power, with respect

00:07:52.081 --> 00:07:52.580
to t.

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:56.800
This will give us
the derivative of h

00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:03.630
of t to the third power with
respect to d with respect

00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:05.090
to t, which is
exactly what we want

00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:06.740
to do when we apply
this operator.

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:08.480
How fast is this changing?

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:11.510
How is this changing
with respect to time?

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:13.172
So we can just
rewrite this, just

00:08:13.172 --> 00:08:14.380
so gets a little bit cleaner.

00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:15.879
Let me rewrite
everything I've done.

00:08:15.879 --> 00:08:18.640
So we've got dV, the rate
at which our volume is

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:20.570
changing with respect to time.

00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:24.050
The rate at which our volume is
changing with respect to time

00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:31.460
is equal to pi over 12
times 3 h of t squared,

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:36.289
or I could just write
that as 3h squared,

00:08:36.289 --> 00:08:38.929
times the rate at which
the height is changing

00:08:38.929 --> 00:08:41.960
with respect to
time, times dh dt.

00:08:47.222 --> 00:08:48.680
And you might be
a little confused.

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:52.670
You might have been tempted to
take the derivative over here

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:53.607
with respect to h.

00:08:53.607 --> 00:08:55.190
But remember, we're
thinking about how

00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:57.890
things are changing
with respect to time.

00:08:57.890 --> 00:09:00.010
So we're assuming--
we did express volume

00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:01.820
as a function of
height-- but we're

00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:03.820
saying that height itself
is a function of time.

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:05.653
So we're taking the
derivative of everything

00:09:05.653 --> 00:09:06.790
with respect to time.

00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:08.900
So that's why the chain
rule came into play

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:10.690
when we were taking
the derivative of h,

00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:12.740
or the derivative of
h of t, because we're

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:15.230
assuming that h is
a function of time.

00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:18.740
Now what does this thing
right over here get us?

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:20.660
Well we're telling us
at the exact moment

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:22.880
that we set up this
problem, we know

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:27.900
what dV dt is, we know that it's
1 centimeter cubed per second.

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:29.530
We know that this
right over here

00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:33.620
is 1 centimeter
cubed per second.

00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:35.620
We know what our height
is right at this moment.

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:37.090
We were told it
is 2 centimeters.

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:45.200
So the only unknown
we have over here

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.750
is the rate at
which our height is

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:48.070
changing with respect to time.

00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:50.320
Which is exactly what
we needed to figure out

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:51.834
in the first place.

00:09:51.834 --> 00:09:53.250
So we just have
to solve for that.

00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:55.870
So we get 1 cubic
centimeter-- let

00:09:55.870 --> 00:10:01.220
me make it clear-- we get 1
cubic centimeter per second--

00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:03.520
I won't write the units
to save some space-- is

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:05.306
equal to pi over 2.

00:10:05.306 --> 00:10:06.930
And I'll write this
in a neutral color.

00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:08.638
Actually, let me write
in the same color.

00:10:08.638 --> 00:10:15.480
Is equal to pi over 2,
times 3, times h squared.

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:18.616
h is 2 so you're going to get
4 squared centimeters if we

00:10:18.616 --> 00:10:19.420
kept the units.

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:21.674
So 3 times 4.

00:10:21.674 --> 00:10:23.340
All right let me be
careful, that wasn't

00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:25.765
pi over 2, that was pi over 12.

00:10:25.765 --> 00:10:29.780
This is a pi over
12 right over here.

00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:39.350
So you get pi over 12, times 3
times 2 squared, times dh dt.

00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:41.020
All of this is equal to 1.

00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:42.920
So now I'll switch
to a neutral color.

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:46.130
We get 1 is equal to,
well 3 times 4 is 12,

00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:47.710
cancels out with that 12.

00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:51.800
We get one is equal
to pi times dh dt.

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:54.770
To solve for dh dt
divide both sides by pi.

00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:57.162
And we get our drum roll now.

00:10:57.162 --> 00:10:59.370
The rate at which our height
is changing with respect

00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:03.260
to time as we're putting 1 cubic
centimeter of water per second

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:03.910
in.

00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:05.987
And right when our height
is 2 centimeters high,

00:11:05.987 --> 00:11:08.570
the rate at which this height
is changing with respect to time

00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:13.330
is 1 over pi.

00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:15.330
And I haven't done the
dimensional analysis

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:19.486
but this is going to be
in centimeters per second.

00:11:19.486 --> 00:11:21.360
You can work through
the dimensional analysis

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:24.250
if you like by putting in the
dimensions right over here.

00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:25.610
But there you have it.

00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:27.890
That's how fast
our height is going

00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:31.790
to be changing at
exactly that moment.
