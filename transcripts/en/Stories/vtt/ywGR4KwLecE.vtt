00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.630
HOST: The world is
full of amazing places,

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:06.330
both natural wonders
and man-made marvels.

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.130
But this place here?

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:09.640
This place is different.

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:13.140
This colorful, odd-shaped,
Dr.-Seussesque water spout

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:14.515
is actually a
little bit of both.

00:00:18.624 --> 00:00:19.540
JARED ROPELATO: Hello.

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:20.623
My name is Jared Ropelato.

00:00:20.623 --> 00:00:23.090
And I'm a photographer
from Vacaville, California.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:24.830
This is a photograph
of Fly Geyser.

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.370
I had seen photographs
of Fly Geyser previously.

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:29.230
And I wanted to
see it for myself.

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.450
So I headed out, tried to find.

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.020
HOST: Fly Geyser is located
on the edge of Black Rock

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.330
Desert, the Nevada home of the
now world-famous Burning Man

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:38.280
Festival.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.597
And the way it got its
name is a bit repetitive.

00:00:40.597 --> 00:00:42.180
JARED ROPELATO: It's
called Fly Geyser

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.470
because it was actually created
on a ranch called Fly Ranch.

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.090
And when it started
erupting water,

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.930
that area flooded and
became Fly Reservoir.

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.990
And now sitting on
top is Fly Geyser.

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:57.860
HOST: And when Jared
says "created,"

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.250
he didn't mean by
some earthquake

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.880
or natural phenomenon.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.760
It was made by accident
when a power company drilled

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.670
into a geothermal
pocket in the 1960s

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.880
and let loose a stream
of boiling water,

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.460
and with it, calcium
deposits, which gave it

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.140
that weird look over time.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.390
JARED ROPELATO: Fly
Geyser is always changing

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.910
and always evolving.

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.800
It's sort of a living sculpture.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.410
The bacteria and the minerals
that are in the water

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:23.540
create this colorful
crust around it

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.870
with terraced
landscaping all around.

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:29.940
And as more water shoots
out, pieces break off

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.825
and new pieces grow.

00:01:31.825 --> 00:01:34.494
So it looks different today
than it did when I shot it.

00:01:34.494 --> 00:01:35.910
HOST: And those
vibrant colors are

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:38.440
from something called
thermalphilic algae,

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.980
microorganisms that
thrive in hot water,

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.154
like the boiling hot
springs of Yellowstone.

00:01:43.154 --> 00:01:44.820
JARED ROPELATO: The
first time I saw it,

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.370
I couldn't believe something
like this could even exist.

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:49.830
The vibrancy of the
reds and the oranges

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.002
and the yellows and the
greens, it's just remarkable.

00:01:53.002 --> 00:01:54.460
HOST: And Jared
understands that it

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.500
looks too weird for some people
to even believe it's real.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.292
It actually has its
own page on snopes.com.

00:02:00.292 --> 00:02:03.874
But he also knows that within
that doubt may lie motivation.

00:02:03.874 --> 00:02:06.040
JARED ROPELATO: Some people
might look at this photo

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.989
and assume that
it's fake somehow.

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.530
If I hadn't seen it
with my own eyes,

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.890
I might think the same thing.

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.060
I hope people that see this are
blown away, by not the photo,

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.470
but by Fly Geyser itself.

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.060
And I hope they're intrigued.

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.160
I hope they're curious.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.292
I hope they wonder if
it's real or if it's fake.

00:02:26.292 --> 00:02:28.000
And I hope that eats
at them a little bit

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.610
and they actually get out
there and take a look at it

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:30.660
for themselves.

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:31.990
It's just one of those things.

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:33.565
There's so much
beauty in this world.

00:02:33.565 --> 00:02:36.960
There are s many crazy, crazy
things like this if you go out

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:37.840
and you find them.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.280
Go see this thing for yourself.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.300
You'll be blown away.

00:02:46.474 --> 00:02:48.140
HOST: If you liked
this video, check out

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.410
this next one on the wild side
of Yellowstone National Park.

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.100
JONO HEY: We saw these
shadows in the mist

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.930
and started hurrying towards it.

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:57.970
And yet, you have this
joint feeling of like,

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:59.100
this is really exciting.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.350
And these are bison.

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.940
And bison are really scary.

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.970
HOST: And as always,
don't forget to subscribe.

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:06.760
Thanks for watching.
