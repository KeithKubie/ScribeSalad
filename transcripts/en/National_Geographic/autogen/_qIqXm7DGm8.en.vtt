sketches and drawing and I try react to
 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.600
sketches and drawing and I try react to
those drawings so we're creating kind of

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610
those drawings so we're creating kind of
 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.600
those drawings so we're creating kind of
a rising spiral of stuff which is kind

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610
a rising spiral of stuff which is kind
 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.399

yeah and we agree on the camera angles

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860
yeah and we agree on the camera angles
 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.370

and the kind of shots were gonna have

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380
and the kind of shots were gonna have
 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.520
