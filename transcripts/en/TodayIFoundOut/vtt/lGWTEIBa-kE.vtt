00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:15.150
One of only two highwaymen sufficiently dashing
to have earned a place in Lord Macaulay’s

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.070
famous History of England, in the summer of
1676, John “Swift Nick” Nevison famously

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:26.680
galloped from Kent to York, a journey of about
200 miles, in a single, very long day- all

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:27.960
to create an alibi.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.320
Like much of his life, little is definitively
known of John Nevison’s early life.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:38.890
Born around 1639-40 at Wortley, South Yorkshire,
Nevison’s family was apparently comfortably

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:39.890
middle class.

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.899
Prone to trouble, Nevison left home while
in his early teens, and moved to London where

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:47.060
he worked as a brewer’s clerk for many years.

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:52.510
For unclear reasons, Nevison abruptly left
England for Holland (purportedly, after stealing

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:57.160
the money from a debt he was sent to collect),
and while there joined the Duke of York’s

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.690
army in Flanders, ultimately fighting in the
Siege of Dunkirk (1658).

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.970
After his discharge, he returned to England
and lived quietly with his father until the

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:08.920
senior Nevison’s death.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.869
At this point flat broke, Nevison took to
the life of a highwayman, waylaying travellers

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:16.000
and stealing their valuables.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.750
Tall, charming and with good manners, it is
reported, perhaps legend, perhaps not, that

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:26.140
Nevison and his gang never, or rarely, used
violence when accosting people on the Great

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.380
North Road between Huntington and York.

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:35.270
Whether just another embellishment to a legendary,
not well-documented figure or not, Nevison

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.880
also supposedly only targeted the rich.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.740
(To be fair, this just makes sense as the
rich, well, are rich and have more valuable

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.610
things to take, meaning more money and less
robberies needed.)

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.990
On the day that earned him his nickname (pun
intended), Nevison had robbed a traveller

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.260
early in the morning (about 4 a.m.) at Gad’s
Hill in Kent, England.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:59.119
Being recognized, Nevison realized he needed
an alibi, and soon embarked on a daring journey

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:00.210
to get one.

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.960
Crossing the Thames River via ferry, Nevison
rode through Chelmsford, Cambridge and Huntington,

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.420
before finally reaching York via the Great
North Road.

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:14.390
Pausing only occasionally for short periods
to rest his horse, Nevison made the 200-mile-plus

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.150
trip by sunset.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.950
Quickly stashing his exhausted horse, Nevison
found lodgings, washed and dressed in clean

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.930
clothes, and then strolled over to the green
where he knew he would find the Lord Mayor

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:26.930
bowling.

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.700
He struck up a conversation with the dignitary,
and even placed a bet on the match, marking

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.040
the time it was placed at 8 p.m.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.470
Of course, Nevison was later arrested for
the robbery, but since he was able to produce

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.680
the distinguished Lord Mayor of York as his
alibi, and the court could not conceive of

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.440
making that journey in such a short period
of time, he was acquitted.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.959
However, word got out about his daring ride
and clever alibi and Nevison became “Swift

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:57.150
Nick,” (legend has it King Charles II, who
would later offer a large reward for the capture

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:04.580
of Nevison, gave him the moniker), and over
the years, he continued to rob travellers

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.670
on the Great North Road.

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:14.080
Caught several times, “Swift Nick” again
earned his nickname when he was able to escape

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:20.490
authorities in 1674 (from the Wakefield goal),
1676 (from transportation to Tangiers – some

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:26.510
say he jumped ship before it left harbor)
and in 1681 (he played dead, and an accomplice

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.890
pretended to be a doctor who gave “plague”
as the cause of death, so nobody wanted to

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.040
go near the body to double check Nick was
really dead).

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:39.030
Moving up from robbery, Swift Nick crossed
a line when he supposedly killed a constable

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.350
named Darcy Fletcher, who was trying to arrest
him.

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:48.379
With a bounty on his head, Nevison was caught
in Sandal in West Yorkshire, while drinking

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:50.819
at an Inn (either the Plough, the Three Houses
or the Magpie).

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:53.700
Swift Nick’s journey through life ended
in a short drop and a sudden stop when he

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.860
was hanged at York Castle on May 4, 1684.

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:08.730
He 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:32.180
is buried somewhere at St. Mary’s Church,
York in an unmarked grave.
