hey Bill I'm getting ready to apply to
 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.520
hey Bill I'm getting ready to apply to
college in the near future I've always

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530
college in the near future I've always
 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.740
college in the near future I've always
loved science but it's never going to

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750
loved science but it's never going to
 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.780

always struggled in it a little bit do

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609
always struggled in it a little bit do

you think that there's a possibility I

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320
you think that there's a possibility I
 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.830
you think that there's a possibility I
could pick science as my major and

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840
could pick science as my major and
 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.769
could pick science as my major and
become hopefully a scientist one day in

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779
become hopefully a scientist one day in
 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.689

you need to if you're a junior just do a

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950
you need to if you're a junior just do a
 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.260
you need to if you're a junior just do a
little more algebra and I bet you're

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270
little more algebra and I bet you're
 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.999
little more algebra and I bet you're
more comfortable with the whole idea and

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009
more comfortable with the whole idea and
 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.089
more comfortable with the whole idea and
you might change the world go get em

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099
you might change the world go get em
 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.059
you might change the world go get em
