00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Well, look what we have here.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
If this is our pendulum and this is our pivot point,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
when I pull back the pendulum it's going to trace out this circle.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Now, of course, I'm constraining myself to small angles,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
so let's get rid of most of that circle.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
But when I pull back my pendulum by angle of θ,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
let's say this pendulum has some length L that's the distance from here to here.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
We can do the same sort of ratio that we did way back in Unit 1

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
when we were measure the circumference of the earth.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
This angle θ, when compared to the entire angle of the circle, 2π radians,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
is in the same ratio as this arc length, which I'm going to call x,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
to the entire circumference of the circle, which is 2π times the radius or L.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
If this isn't clear, let me just explain this one more time.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:47.000
What I'm saying is the ratio of this angle to the entire 360° or 2π radians of a circle.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
That's identical to the ratio of this distance to the total circumference.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
This angle to the total angle is the same as this distance to the total distance.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
What I'm trying to do is replace this θ, so I'm going to solve for θ.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
When I do, I get θ = x/L. Now we're making progress.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Let's see what happens.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Now I have that a is equal to -g(x/L), having made that replacement.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Or put another way, a - -g/L(x)--minus something times x.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
We have simple harmonic motion in our pendulum. Wonderful.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Now, I'm going to ask you a very hard question,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
because it's going to have you put together a lot of the things we've been talking about.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
We're trying to design a clock. We want a period of 1 second.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000
I want to know how long should our pendulum be if we want a period of 1 second?

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Don't forget that this something here becomes ω².

00:01:36.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Enter your answer here in meters.
