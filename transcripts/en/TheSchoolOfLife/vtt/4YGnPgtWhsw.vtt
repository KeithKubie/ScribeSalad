00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.680
Theodor Wiesengrund Adorno 
was born in Frankfurt in 1903

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.660
into a wealthy and cultured family.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:21.320
His father, a wine merchant, was of Jewish origin 
but had converted to Protestantism at university.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.540
Until his twenties, Adorno planned for a career 
as a composer, but eventually focused

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.660
on philosophy.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.580
In 1934, he was barred on racial grounds 
from teaching in Germany.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:35.980
So he moved to Oxford and later to New York 
and then Los Angeles.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.780
He was both fascinated and repelled by 
Californian consumer culture

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.220
and thought with unusual depth about 
sun tans and drive-ins.

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:49.620
Adorno was closely connected with 
a pioneering institute of social research

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.540
also known as the Frankfurt School which had 
been founded and funded by his friend

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.760
Felix Weil.
The institute aimed to develop a

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.960
psychological understanding of the problems

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.660
thrown up modern capitalism, 
especially the culture and mindset it generates.

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:09.900
Adorno drew attention to three significant ways 
in which capitalism corrupts and degrades us.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.940
 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.280
Adorno believed that the primary focus

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.180
for progressive philosophers should be the study

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:24.680
of how the working and middle classes of developed nations think and feel and in particular the manner in

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.680
in which they spend their evenings and weekends.

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.040
Adorno had a highly ambitious view of 
what leisure time should be for.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.100
It was not to relax and take one's mind of things.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.100
Free time should be our prime opportunity

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.020
to expand and develop ourselves 
to reach after our better

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.340
nature and to acquire the tools 
with which to change society.

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:46.180
 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.240
It's a time when we might see films that can help us 
to understand our relationships with new clarity

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.660
or read books that give us fresh insights into politics

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:59.460
or listen to music that gives us courage 
to reform ourselves and collective life

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.820
But in the modern world, Adorno bemoaned 
that leisure has fallen into the hands of an

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:11.660
omnipresent and deeply malevolent entertainment machine which he called The Culture Industry.

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:18.120
Modern films, TV, radio, magazines and now social media seemed for Adorno to be almost designed

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:24.960
to keep us distracted, unable to understand ourselves and without the will to alter political reality.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:30.100
So for example, the news will feed us a mixture of salacious nonsense and political stories,

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:36.120
that scramble any possibility of understanding 
the open prison within which we exist.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.160
The cinema shows us the 
adventures of an alien invasion,

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.600
while the real calamities of our world go unattended.

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:47.140
Pop music focuses relentlessly on 
the emotions around romantic love,

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.840
suggesting that happiness can only come from 
meeting one very special person,

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:57.960
rather that awakening us to the pleasures of community and of a more broadly distributed human sympathy.

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:03.660
We wander through museum galleries, privately unsure what they really mean and why we should care.

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.420
The Culture Industry likes to keep us like that,

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.760
distracted, pliant, confused and a bit intimidated.

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:16.220
Adorno perceptively described Walt Disney 
as the most dangerous man in America.

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:24.380
 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:25.800
Because of the huge range

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.500
of consumer goods available in modern capitalism,

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.000
we naturally suppose that everything 
we could possible want is available.

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.340
The only problem, if there is one,

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.500
is that we can't afford it.

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.860
But Adorno pointed out that our real wants

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.280
are carefully shielded from us by capitalist industry

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:48.040
so that we end up forgetting what it is we truly need 
and settle instead for desires manufactured

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:53.020
for us by cooperations without 
any interest in our true welfare.

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.040
Though we think we live in world of plenty,

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.500
what we really require to thrive,

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.200
namely tenderness, understanding, 
calm, insight, community -

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:08.680
all these things are in painfully short supply and are utterly disconnected from the present economy.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:09.300
 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.700
When they're trying to sell something, 
advertisers show us the thing that we really

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.000
want and then connect it to 
something, we don't actually need.

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.600
So we can see an advert showing a group of friends

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.000
walking along a beach chatting amiably

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.920
or a family having a picnic and 
laughing warmly together.

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.480
These adverts show us these things because they know

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.080
we crave community and connection.

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.260
But the industrial economy prefers to keep us 
lonely and consuming.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:35.600
So at the end of the adverts,

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.580
we'll be urged to buy some 25 year old whiskey

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.900
or a car so powerful that no road will ever let us 
legally drive it at top speed.

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:48.760
 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.700
Adorno was writing at the dawn of the age

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.040
of the psychological questionnaire.

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.340
These were widely in use in the United States 
where they were measuring

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.400
consumer attitudes and commercial behaviour.

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.900
Adorno was intrigued by the underlying 
concept of a questionnaire

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:08.400
and so together with colleagues devoted himself to designing a rather different kind of questionnaire,

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.360
one designed to spot fascists.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:17.560
The questionnaire that he designed asked contributors to assess their level of agreement with statements like:

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:23.880
"Obedience and respect for authority are the most important virtues children should learn" and

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:28.220
"If people would talk less and work more, 
everybody would be better off" and

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:32.580
"When a person has a problem or worry, 
it's best for him not to think about it,

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.400
but to keep busy with more cheerful things".

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.540
Given the traumas Germany had just been through,

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:40.400
it is no surprise that Adorno gave his questionnaire

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:45.840
and what he called the F-scale, 
fascist scale, such attention.

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:50.320
His team even sent the F-scale to 
every school in West Germany.

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:53.540
But a more widely applicable lesson 
to be drawn from this experiment

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:57.540
is that psychology comes ahead of politics.
Long before

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:01.100
someone is racist, homophobic or authoritarian,

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:03.460
they are, Adorno skillfully suggested,

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:08.100
likely to be suffering from psychological 
frailties and immaturities

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:12.760
which is the task of a good society to get 
better at spotting and responding to.

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:14.940
Rather than leaving problems to fester so long

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:17.360
that there's eventually no way to deal with them

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.100
other than through force, 
we should learn to understand

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:24.380
the psychological of everyday insanity 
from the earliest moments.

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:25.280
 

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:28.020
Adorno was a left-wing thinker who recognized

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.400
that the primary obstacles to social progress

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:36.040
are cultural and psychological 
rather than narrowly political or economic.

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:40.400
We already have the money, the resources, 
the time and the skills to make sure

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:42.460
that everyone can sleep at a house,

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:44.060
stop destroying the planet,

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:47.560
is given fulfilling job and 
feel supported by the community.

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:48.920
So the reason why we

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:51.360
continue to suffer and hurt one another,

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:54.740
is first and foremost because our minds are sick.

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:57.600
This is the continuing provocation

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:02.320
offered by the beguiling and calmly furious 
work of Theodor Adorno.
