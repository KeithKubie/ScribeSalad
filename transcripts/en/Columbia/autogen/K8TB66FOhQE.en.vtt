that wouldn't work in people if we

worked hard enough at it by identifying

memory loss I was a very surprised to

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140
memory loss I was a very surprised to
 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.319

see that when I increase the levels of

this protein specifically the dentate

gyrus of aged wild-type mice to see the

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340
gyrus of aged wild-type mice to see the
 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.310
gyrus of aged wild-type mice to see the
memory performance of these mice to get

memory performance of these mice to get
 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.290
memory performance of these mice to get
better and actually to be comparable

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300
better and actually to be comparable
 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.119

with the young mice and did expect that

that was a surprising finding the point

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350
that was a surprising finding the point
 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.790
that was a surprising finding the point
here is that we now have a molecular

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800
here is that we now have a molecular
 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.220
here is that we now have a molecular
measure or lure with which we can now

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230

assess all these interventions whether

it's what we eat how we behave or even a

pharmaceutical agent I think this paper

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239

provides further and most compelling

one molecular pathway that is critically

one molecular pathway that is critically

involved based not only in the current

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.380

earlier studies this really sets the

earlier studies this really sets the
 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.320
earlier studies this really sets the
stage for developing better diagnostics

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330
stage for developing better diagnostics
 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.080
stage for developing better diagnostics
and better interventions to try to

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090
and better interventions to try to
 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.940

ameliorate age-related memory decline

ameliorate age-related memory decline
 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.000
