00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:06.620
&gt;&gt;Eric: I wanted to put the image of the cover
of my book up here to begin the talk, yes,

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.960
partly for promotional reasons, uh, I confess,
but also because I want you to pay attention

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:16.080
to a couple things on the cover image, it
was not easy to come up with.

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.119
Um, and the two really important things to
note here, first is just the title of the

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.210
book, which is called Going Solo.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.550
And, for much of the project, when I was doing
the research and writing it, the title I was

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.420
working with was called Alone in America.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.120
And I just want you think about the place
that Alone in America, as a title, takes you

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.600
to, as opposed to Going Solo, takes you to
a very different place.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.000
And the other thing I want you to pay attention
to is, the birds.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.399
Uh, because it turns out that when you have
a title like Alone in America, you think of

00:00:54.399 --> 00:01:01.140
another set of images, you have a cassette
of stock images in your mind already and I

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.140
think I know what they are.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.379
I want to show them to you later and see if
you agree.

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.280
Um, the birds are not those images, so keep
this in mind.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.960
What I want to do over the next forty minutes
or so is persuade you of two big ideas.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.860
Uh the first is this one and I'm not going
to insult you by reading them to you, I'm

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.150
guessing that you guys read slides.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.680
One of my pet peeves is people who come and
give PowerPoint presentations and read you

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:25.680
slides.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.500
Um, you can do that on your own, but this
is the first big idea.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.740
Um and this is the second one.

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.030
It doesn't mean what we think.

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.149
Now, I'm presuming you think something and
that might not be fair, but when I asked you

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:46.030
if you had an image for Alone in America,
I'm guessing it's one of either of the two

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:47.650
images I'm about to show you.

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:52.909
You might have thought of a guy like this,
the kind of Lone Ranger, frontier character.

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:58.159
Uh an iconic figure in American culture and
you would have good reason.

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:05.789
It turns out until about the 1950s living
alone in the United States was most prevalent

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:12.690
in the big open sprawling western states,
places like Alaska and Wyoming and Montana.

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.640
These were largely migrant working men and
in my fantasies, they look like this.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.260
They're lone ranger kinds of guys.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.680
But we're in New York City and I, you know,
trust that you're urbanists and so when we

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.290
in New York City think of what it is to live
alone or to be alone we often times think

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.010
of this image here.

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.350
This is Ed Hopper's 'Nighthawks', a 1943 painting.

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.590
And there many things that could be said about
this image.

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.280
It's you know, also one of the great icons
of American culture.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.379
But what's typically said about it is, this
is a depiction of profound loneliness.

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:48.980
And we can see it in many ways.

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:54.270
If you look, for instance at the man whose
back is towards us, you know what's notable

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:58.400
about him is that he's by himself and it's
night.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.790
Now it's interesting to me, we actually don't
see his face, he might look really happy,

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.190
actually, he might be having the time of his
life there, but we project on to him this

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.090
sense that you know, he's off, he's having
a bad night, he's by himself.

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:17.930
And I want us to remember this idea, too,
that we tend to project a lot onto the image

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.959
of the person who is alone.

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:21.530
Um, so he looks lonely.

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:26.690
But in a way and this is also important for
our story, the people across from him look

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.790
pretty lonely, too.

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.920
They are together but they don't seem to be
having a love connection.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.840
Uh, you know, something is off.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.769
And remember this idea.

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:47.060
Now 1943, it would make some sense to think
of people who are alone as being off in someway.

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.220
It was very unusual to live alone or even
to be single.

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:56.860
So what you're looking at here is just a simple
bar chart of the proportion of American adults

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:04.780
who were single in 1950 about 22% and also
the proportion of American households that

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.659
had just one person, under 10%.

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:08.340
OK, this is 1950.

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:13.209
So maybe that kind of atmosphere, the mood
you get in the hopper painting makes some

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:16.170
sense given the time.

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:21.420
You should know also that peoples views about
those who lived alone were in keeping with

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:23.020
this kind of story.

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.770
When some psychologists at the university
of Michigan did a survey of American's attitudes

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:32.110
towards people who lived alone and were single
they found that 80% of American adults thought

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:39.170
that single people were either sick or neurotic
or immoral if they wanted to be single.

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:44.790
It was just a very weird thing to be doing
then and we were quite judgmental about it.

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:51.000
I'm a social scientist and let me say that
my discipline has contributed to this idea.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:57.530
The best selling books in the history of American
sociology have titles like The Lonely Crowd,

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:00.440
The Fall of Public Man.

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:04.800
More recent titles that maybe you've seen,
Bowling Alone; do you remember this concept

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.060
of bowling alone?

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:09.660
Uh, Robert Putnam's great book from about
12 years ago.

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:15.000
And more recently Sherry Turkle an MIT professor,
Alone Together about the ways in which technology

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.380
including social media, --maybe especially
social media-- in her view, estrange us from

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:21.380
one another.

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:24.380
This has been a long-standing concern of American
life.

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:28.060
If any of you are subscribers to the Atlantic
Monthly, you'll know that their current cover

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:32.900
story asks the question 'Is Facebook Making
Us Lonely?'

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:37.380
And the author claims that, in fact, we are
experiencing an epidemic of loneliness in

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:38.380
the United States.

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:41.460
We have never been lonelier or more atomized
he claims.

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.070
We hear ideas like this quite often.

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:50.090
Uh, about six years ago, a blockbuster study
came out in the American Sociological Review,

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:55.170
the kind of premier journal in my discipline,
and it reported that we've never been more

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:56.410
isolated.

00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:03.210
One in four Americans, it claimed, said that
they have no confidant, no close friend, no

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:07.850
one with whom they can discuss important confidential
personal matters.

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:16.310
And that was an incredible spike from 1985
when, uh, when it was just under 1 in 10 in

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:17.310
fact.

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:24.250
So what really changed between 1984 and 1985
and 2004, well, the internet.

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:26.960
So a lot of people thought well maybe this
is a story about the internet.

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.600
This is a story we are used to telling ourselves.

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:35.470
Let me also confess, my first book is about
a heat wave in Chicago was for many people

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:39.910
powerful because it reported on hundreds of
people dying alone in the city of Chicago

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:44.680
and the book is kind of thought to be in that
tradition of, you know, stories about how

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:48.890
isolated and estranged we've become in the
united states.

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:53.510
So I am, I have contributed to this concept
myself, you know, full disclosure.

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:59.150
When I finished the reporting for Heat Wave
and the research for Heat Wave, I decided

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:05.830
I was going to do a bigger project, on this
issue of living alone and being alone in American

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:06.830
cities.

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:12.120
I thought something important was happening
and I expected that what was important was

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:13.270
that we were getting estranged.

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:18.560
I thought I would write the book I told you
the title of, Alone in America.

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:22.630
But the first thing I did is I pulled out
of the story of Chicago was principally the

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:28.150
people I studied were older and frail and
poor and I wanted to see, you know, who really

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:32.810
does live alone in the United States.

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:36.930
So I want to direct you for the moment towards
the bottom of this chart, where you get the

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:38.740
distribution of living alone by age.

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:40.500
Now this was a surprise to me.

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:46.400
OK, it turns out that today, about 32.7 million
Americans live alone.

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:50.570
OK that's up from the 4 million in 1950.

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:52.900
Uh, 9% of all households.

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:57.491
I thought they'd be mostly elderly, but the
truth is about a third of people who live

00:07:57.491 --> 00:08:02.491
alone today are over the age of 65 and I'm
reluctant even to call them elderly, because

00:08:02.491 --> 00:08:08.150
part of the story is that people are staying
younger for longer and more active and engaged

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:12.740
in the world as they hit their sixties and
seventies.

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:17.160
About half of the people who live alone in
the United states today are middle aged adults

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:19.660
between the ages of 35 and 64.

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:24.090
Typically the have lived with someone else
before, generally they have been married and

00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:27.070
they're now separated or divorced.

00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:32.330
Um, but they're not the people I studied when
I did the book about Chicago.

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:38.530
And then, this is a surprise to me before
I stated, by far the fastest growing segment

00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:44.010
of American's who live alone in the last several
decades has been young adults under the age

00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:51.420
of 35 about 500 thousand young adults lived
alone in 1950 and today more than 5 million

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:52.420
do.

00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:56.280
They represent about 11% of all young adults.

00:08:56.280 --> 00:09:02.360
And so if you think about this change from
1950, it really is quite staggering and this

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:08.440
is you know what earns for me the first claim
I gave you that this is the biggest social

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:10.770
change we haven't named or identified.

00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:15.970
Look at the dramatic spike in the number of
people who are unmarried, single, today it's

00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:21.780
about half of all adults and then next to
it, the proportion of households that have

00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:22.780
just one person.

00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:27.580
You know from 9% in 1950 to 28% today.

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:32.300
This is a striking demographic shift and one
that has far-reaching implications.

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:37.110
So I just want to give you a little bit more
of the numbers.

00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:41.330
I'm guessing you'd be curious, you can see
what this looks like in terms of the sheer

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:42.330
population.

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:45.470
From 1960 to today.

00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:50.480
You can look at it at the proportion of households,
pretty similar slope.

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:57.700
I told you that in 1950 living alone was most
common in this big sprawling western states

00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:00.590
and rural areas, the Lone Ranger was our figure.

00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:05.000
Well, by today, it has become an overwhelmingly
urban phenomenon.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.400
And not just one in the you know, kind of
fancy elite coastal cities, you might not

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:16.120
be surprised that 42% of households are one
person households in Seattle or 40% in San

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:18.940
Francisco, you know, near the mother ship.

00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:27.060
But look at Denver and Minneapolis and Atlanta,
you know, all above 40%.

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:35.520
Washington DC, 48%, Manhattan now 46%, you
know almost one in every two households.

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:40.380
So this is really that, it's really become
something that we do in cities and that's

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:41.800
striking.

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:45.130
What I want to do for the remainder of my
talk is kind of move beyond these numbers

00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:49.930
though and get you kind of inside the story
of my research and tell you more about what

00:10:49.930 --> 00:10:52.270
I learned and what this means.

00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:57.730
The the work for this project, uh, involved
getting the numbers right up front, but then

00:10:57.730 --> 00:11:03.840
also doing hundreds of interviews with people
who live alone in different cities around

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:09.190
the United states, mainly cities in this research
and a little bit outside of the United States

00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:10.190
as well.

00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:14.250
And we did research with people who fall into
the three different age groups I gave you

00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:15.250
before.

00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:20.010
And then also and I won't talk about it much
today, uh, with a smaller sample of pretty

00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:23.000
poor men who live alone in hotel residences.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:28.930
It's a declining group in many respects, but
numerically as well.

00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:34.800
One of the big conceptual changes for me in
doing this book came from thinking about living

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:39.610
alone as a social problem, which is what generally
attracts the interest of sociologists, you

00:11:39.610 --> 00:11:45.030
know something we perceive to be a problem
in the world, to thinking about it as a social

00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:47.960
experiment, which is more unusual.

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:50.740
And why did I see it that way?

00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:57.779
Well, one of the things I learned doing a
lot of reading in history and anthropology

00:11:57.779 --> 00:12:06.850
is that until about the 1950s you cannot find
a single human society in the history of our

00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:13.120
species that sustained large numbers of people
living alone for long periods of time.

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:17.520
It literally does not exist and this is a
little passage from one of the classic books

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:22.330
in anthropology uh George Murdock on social
structure where he makes the claim that the

00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:25.090
nuclear family is a universal.

00:12:25.090 --> 00:12:28.580
And he was challenged, but generally from
people who said 'you know what about the kibbutz

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:31.290
or what about this more communal arrangement?'

00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:35.350
No one challenged him and said 'look at this
society where large numbers of people organized

00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:40.770
their personal lives by living alone' It's
a novel experience and this we misunderstand

00:12:40.770 --> 00:12:45.470
it if we see it only as a social problem.

00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:47.750
So how did it happen?

00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:50.430
How did we make this sudden break?

00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:54.279
This innovation in the way we organize our
lives and how should we think about it?

00:12:54.279 --> 00:13:00.480
Well, the first thing to say is it's expensive
to live alone and one reason you see the spike

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:06.630
in living alone after the 1950s is we have
more widespread affluence.

00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:11.210
It's a tough thing to say in a moment like
this when the economy's not doing so well,

00:13:11.210 --> 00:13:18.130
but the period after World War II is a beginning
of a period of real affluence in many developed

00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:19.130
economies.

00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:24.370
Uh, some of the wealth comes from the market
economy, but much of the security that we've

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:29.780
earned since then comes too from the contributions
to the welfare state and when you have Social

00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:34.880
Security and guaranteed health care and home
care and public transportation and all the

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:40.220
things we now in some ways take for granted
as part of the welfare estate it becomes much

00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:47.150
easier to live independently and get the kinds
of services and support you need from institutions

00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:51.410
that are not the family, sharing a home with
you.

00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:57.410
And when you recognize that living alone is
a feature of an affluent society, you flip

00:13:57.410 --> 00:14:04.030
the question from social problem to this one:
Of all the ways that we could use our resources,

00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:05.710
you know, why this?

00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:09.370
You know, what does this say?

00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:12.940
You know it's not, this is not an easy question
to answer.

00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:16.380
But it's important to ask the question in
this way.

00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:22.310
Well, one of the things that's clear is that
living alone comports with a number of our

00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:24.380
sacred modern values, right?

00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:29.600
It gives us a level of freedom to do what
we want, when we want to do it.

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:36.089
Uh, it allows us to achieve a level of personal
control that can be very difficult, uh, when

00:14:36.089 --> 00:14:38.920
we share space with another person.

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:45.680
When we have that space, we have a chance
for a level of self-realization, uh, for young

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:49.960
people and I'll talk about this a little later,
many of the younger adults who live alone

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:54.300
say that they do it so that they can become
adult.

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:59.230
So that they have the time and space to think
about who they are and the kind of life they

00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:03.529
want to live, the kind of person they want
to become.

00:15:03.529 --> 00:15:08.360
Now that we marry later than ever before,
which we do, the typical age of first marriage

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:14.110
in the United States is about 29 for men and
about 27 for women, uh, it's by getting a

00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:19.680
place of their own that young adults have
this experience of feeling like they are becoming

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:21.220
themselves.

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:26.870
And I'll say something else about this which
is that, people who live alone longer and

00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:32.630
delay getting married as opposed to getting
married in their early 20s are much more likely

00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:37.620
to marry successfully, to stay married than
people who race into it.

00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:42.980
So that's why I say living alone gives people
the, not just the chance for solitude, this

00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:47.680
kind of productive solitude that probably
all of us need and a hyper networked age like

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:49.070
the one we live in now.

00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:55.080
But also because living alone paradoxically
gives us a chance to reconnect.

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:59.890
And to connect in perhaps on a deeper level
with the kinds of people we're really looking

00:15:59.890 --> 00:16:01.350
for.

00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:04.500
OK
In the book, I argue that they're four big

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:09.990
drivers in the spike of living alone in addition
to prosperity, uh, the first is not Mary Tyler

00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:14.750
Moore, but it is the rising status of women
in the world.

00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:20.500
You simply can't understand why, that so many
people live alone outside of this.

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:28.529
Um, when women enter into the paid labor force
en masse in the beginning of the 1950s, um,

00:16:28.529 --> 00:16:34.710
they established the economic independence
to live longer without getting married, you

00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:39.700
know, on their own and they also give themselves
a chance to get out of a bad relationship

00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:47.399
or marriage without sentencing themselves
to a lifetime of poverty or forcing, uh, their

00:16:47.399 --> 00:16:48.399
family to take them in.

00:16:48.399 --> 00:16:53.160
It was actually quite common sixty, seventy,
eighty years ago for a woman for whatever

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:58.560
reason lost her husband, or separated her
husband to move back in with her family.

00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:02.390
Um, and when women become economically independent
they no longer have to do that.

00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:07.870
Of course, women also become more culturally
independent in the post war period, as well.

00:17:07.870 --> 00:17:12.160
Uh and gain a control over their own bodies
that they didn't have before.

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:14.620
The sexual revolution is part of this.

00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:19.819
You can't understand the spike in living alone
outside of it, we notice, I'll just tell you

00:17:19.819 --> 00:17:24.770
one place where there is a lot of affluence,
but almost no one lives alone and that's Saudi

00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:26.630
Arabia.

00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:30.440
In parts of the world where women don't have
this level of independence, living alone is

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:32.910
impossible.

00:17:32.910 --> 00:17:39.040
Now here we are at Google and it would be
silly for me not to emphasize that you can't

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:43.980
really understand the rise of living alone
outside of communications technologies.

00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:48.830
Now admittedly the spike starts in living
alone starts earlier, you saw that on the

00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:50.140
charts I showed before.

00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:53.500
Um, but it's not as if there was not communication
technology, there.

00:17:53.500 --> 00:18:00.240
When you have the telephone and the television
set, then it, you can be home alone and also

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:06.460
connected to ideas and people and information
and entertainment in a way that was previously

00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:08.770
impossible.

00:18:08.770 --> 00:18:17.140
Now think about what it means to live alone
and be home alone when you have Skype and

00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:25.460
Facebook and Google + and instant messaging
and Meetup and Craigslist and all the kinds

00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:29.520
of technologies that we have that connect
us to each other.

00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:36.620
Right it means that living alone and being
home alone can be a profoundly social experience

00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:41.240
and I want to make something clear here, you
know, we are at this moment, remember that

00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:45.840
Facebook cover story, is Facebook making us
lonely, the Atlantic Monthly has right now,

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:52.580
there is a lot of anxiety that social media
has made us less connected, less deeply connected.

00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:58.270
But the best research in the social sciences
we have tells us that the heaviest users of

00:18:58.270 --> 00:19:03.730
social media are also the heaviest users of
face-to-face interaction.

00:19:03.730 --> 00:19:10.140
Heavy users of social media are actually more
likely to spend time in public and to spend

00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:13.600
face time with friends and neighbors than
the lighter users.

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:14.600
OK?

00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:18.480
So a lot of our anxiety is maybe about the
quality of those connections or maybe about

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:22.630
our distraction, there's lots of reasons to
be concerned about where our attention is

00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:24.750
in a digital age.

00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:31.660
But there's no evidence that it's making us
less connected to each other.

00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:37.710
I showed you that map of American cities that
have high proportions of one-person households.

00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:39.540
That's also part of the big story here.

00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:43.790
You can't understand the rise of living alone
outside of urbanization.

00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:50.130
Cities are places where people can live alone
and be together with others who are like them.

00:19:50.130 --> 00:19:55.740
So if I tell you that in Manhattan about one
of every two households is a one person households,

00:19:55.740 --> 00:20:00.780
as people who live here or at least come to
work here everyday, you know that there's

00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:05.640
certain neighborhoods where there far more
single people and people who live alone than

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:06.640
others.

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:15.309
So in places like Chelsea and the West Village
and Midtown, 60 70% of the households are

00:20:15.309 --> 00:20:21.240
one person households and I bet if I say the
names of Los Angeles or Chicago or Seattle

00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:27.000
or San Fransisco or Boston to you you know
precisely which neighborhoods in those cities

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:32.980
are concentrations are places where people
who live alone are concentrated.

00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:36.710
And of course, people who are single or live
alone, and I make a distinction between the

00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:39.080
two, they are different things.

00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:40.660
They are attracted to those places.

00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:46.830
So we have cities have become places that
have transformed the experience of being alone.

00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:51.810
Moreover, and I wrote an article for Fortune
magazine about this recently, I don't think

00:20:51.810 --> 00:20:57.620
you can understand the renaissance of public
life in cities and in urban economies outside

00:20:57.620 --> 00:21:02.110
of the rise of single people and people who
live alone inside of them.

00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:04.410
Because they are very active.

00:21:04.410 --> 00:21:10.600
There's also a myth about people who live
alone, that they are isolated and more lonely,

00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:11.600
right?

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:14.480
They, the people in the Edward Hopper paintings.

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:20.400
But another thing I learned, writing this
book, is that on average people who live alone

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:25.410
are actually more likely to spend time with
friends and with neighbors than people who

00:21:25.410 --> 00:21:26.760
are married.

00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:30.470
It's not going to surprise you learn that
they're more likely to go out at night and

00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:34.342
spend time and money in bars and restaurants
and cafes, you know I'm not going to win a

00:21:34.342 --> 00:21:36.900
Nobel prize for that discovery.

00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:43.280
Um, but they're also more likely to volunteer
in civic organizations, on average, than people

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:44.350
who are married.

00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:48.490
And that really was a surprise to me, we have
a story we tell ourselves about the way in

00:21:48.490 --> 00:21:54.430
which married people and families are the
bedrocks of community life.

00:21:54.430 --> 00:21:58.620
And that's true in some respects but it's
not true in all respects.

00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:04.210
And, of course, the, you know the people who
specifically do more time with friends and

00:22:04.210 --> 00:22:08.410
neighbors and who contribute more to civic
organizations when they're single or living

00:22:08.410 --> 00:22:09.890
alone are women.

00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:14.070
Because married women when they have children,
especially, just don't have the time and the

00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:20.980
energy to contribute to public life in the
same way, they are generally saddled with

00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:23.460
more domestic responsibilities.

00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:27.559
Not to demean that, you know and I should
be really clear, I'm not here to persuade

00:22:27.559 --> 00:22:32.010
you to go home and leave your wife or your
husband, you know, this is not the case to

00:22:32.010 --> 00:22:33.050
live alone.

00:22:33.050 --> 00:22:35.070
It would be hypocritical for me to do that.

00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:38.600
I'm married myself, I have two young kids.

00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:45.000
But this is something that we need to understand
and I think we need to reexamine our attitudes

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:50.740
and kind of, premises about what it means
to live alone and what people who live alone

00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:51.740
do.

00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:58.530
Now the fourth, you know, generator of the
spike in living alone is the longevity revolution.

00:22:58.530 --> 00:23:03.610
Today we live longer than ever before, but
we live unevenly.

00:23:03.610 --> 00:23:09.630
You can't know a certainty that you and your
spouse will live together and die the same

00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:17.170
day or week or year and in fact, it is now
become quite common for women, who tend to

00:23:17.170 --> 00:23:25.410
outlive men, to outlive their spouse by two
or five or ten or in some cases, you know,

00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:27.160
twenty or twenty five years.

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:31.040
And you can probably think of people in your
friendship circle or in your family who have

00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:36.670
lived alone for long periods of time at this
stage of life.

00:23:36.670 --> 00:23:37.670
Right?

00:23:37.670 --> 00:23:43.600
And this is where the Ed Hopper paintings,
you know, really become resonant again.

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:51.760
Uh, when you're old, you're more at risk of
getting isolated and withdrawn, that's why

00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:54.230
so many older people died alone in the heat
wave.

00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:59.950
Now I have to tell you that I was amazed to
learn that from the best survey research that

00:23:59.950 --> 00:24:04.580
older Americans, too, are more likely to spend
time with friends and neighbors if they live

00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:06.610
alone than they are if they're married.

00:24:06.610 --> 00:24:09.179
I really didn't expect that.

00:24:09.179 --> 00:24:14.080
Um, so we shouldn't think that universally
they're isolated and lonely, but there is

00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:15.330
a risk here.

00:24:15.330 --> 00:24:18.520
And, you know, there's a gendered risk as
well, I should say.

00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:24.169
Women are far more likely to age alone, but
they're also better at staying connected to

00:24:24.169 --> 00:24:27.470
friends and family than men, so they tend
to be less isolated.

00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:32.799
Whereas men who live alone especially men
who age alone tend to fare worse.

00:24:32.799 --> 00:24:36.919
I put this slide up here because maybe that
will change.

00:24:36.919 --> 00:24:42.410
You know maybe the way that we connect with
each other provides opportunities for everyone

00:24:42.410 --> 00:24:47.640
who lives alone to establish connect-, you
know, relationships and to be together in

00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:49.160
new ways.

00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:55.549
We know all the ways in which young people
use social media to make ties and to organize

00:24:55.549 --> 00:24:57.549
face-to-face time as well.

00:24:57.549 --> 00:25:03.059
You surely know that increasingly older people
are getting online and using social media

00:25:03.059 --> 00:25:05.120
for in the same ways, right?

00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:11.429
So maybe if you have children, your children
talk to their grandparents with Skype.

00:25:11.429 --> 00:25:15.100
Uh, you know mine do and that's a big change.

00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:19.120
But there are other ways in which older people
are connecting with each other and with other

00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:22.870
neighbors, with people they don't know, through
dating sites, through friendship sites, with

00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:24.630
things like Meetup online as well.

00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:30.280
So there's a whole arena in which social media
and communications technologies become really

00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:38.030
important to thinking about how we will live
together, now that we're living alone.

00:25:38.030 --> 00:25:42.810
I don't mean to be telling you in this you
know, talk today, that we shouldn't be worried

00:25:42.810 --> 00:25:43.960
about loneliness.

00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:49.620
Obviously many people who live alone suffer
from loneliness and it can be difficult to

00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:55.220
be alone and live alone and be lonely, because
it can quickly cycle into a vicious cycle.

00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:56.220
Right?

00:25:56.220 --> 00:26:03.120
Each one feeds the other, but lets be realistic
about loneliness and what it means in the

00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:05.340
human condition, as well.

00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:13.720
Because this is something people told me over
and over again in my interviews.

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:21.030
People worry about us when we live alone,
but they also say that, there's nothing lonelier

00:26:21.030 --> 00:26:24.550
than being in the wrong relationship.

00:26:24.550 --> 00:26:28.679
It means something to feel lonely when you're
sitting at home in your apartment, you know

00:26:28.679 --> 00:26:33.100
you get a cue physiologically, emotionally
to get out into the world and engage with

00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:35.160
other people.

00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:42.490
But if you're lying next to your spouse and
you feel lonely, that's a really powerful

00:26:42.490 --> 00:26:46.560
cue and it's not quite clear what you can
do with that.

00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:50.350
It's profound and intense.

00:26:50.350 --> 00:26:54.429
Remember that study I showed you in the beginning
of the, the talk, the one in four American's

00:26:54.429 --> 00:26:56.270
have no confidant?

00:26:56.270 --> 00:27:06.450
It, I put this up, you know with the, um,
image because the images from USA Today and

00:27:06.450 --> 00:27:10.610
when that study came out in 2006, it got enormous
amounts of attention, it's as if we have an

00:27:10.610 --> 00:27:14.600
appetite to be told that we're isolated from
each other.

00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:16.750
The authors were on every TV show imaginable.

00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:20.179
They got amazing coverage in the USA Today
and the New York Times.

00:27:20.179 --> 00:27:24.860
Well, it turns out the data were flawed.

00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:29.910
Many of us suspected this at the time, not
that it was easy for us to get airtime on

00:27:29.910 --> 00:27:33.630
those TV shows, reporting that you know, we
don't have friends anymore.

00:27:33.630 --> 00:27:41.169
Um, but now the data has really been heavily
scrutinized and the guy who's now a professor

00:27:41.169 --> 00:27:44.100
at Cornell, who was a grad student who crunched
the numbers.

00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:46.970
You guys know about grad students who crunch
numbers here.

00:27:46.970 --> 00:27:51.460
He's, he's, you know, now publicly said, you
know this is not reliable.

00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:52.710
And it isn't.

00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:57.789
Uh, we're not more isolated than ever before,
we're just about as isolated as we always

00:27:57.789 --> 00:27:59.250
have been.

00:27:59.250 --> 00:28:01.760
You know, we're not more lonely than we have
before.

00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:05.299
I took on the Facebook cover story in an article
in Slate.

00:28:05.299 --> 00:28:08.040
We're about as lonely as we have been.

00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:09.040
Right?

00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:12.010
And that doesn't mean we shouldn't be concerned
about some things.

00:28:12.010 --> 00:28:16.470
There's lots of reasons to make our lives
better and to strive for more connection and

00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:22.289
less loneliness but let's not panic, um, let's
not panic about this.

00:28:22.289 --> 00:28:28.419
I told you before that my, um, book was going
to be called Alone In America and I've now

00:28:28.419 --> 00:28:32.450
spent about 40 minutes telling you why the
alone part of the book title was wrong.

00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:34.660
That was a really bad idea.

00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:37.530
People who live alone are not so alone.

00:28:37.530 --> 00:28:42.289
This slide tells you that how bad the 'in
America' part of my title was.

00:28:42.289 --> 00:28:47.450
I really thought this was going to be a thing
about you know American individualism and

00:28:47.450 --> 00:28:50.160
our culture of, you know, self-reliance.

00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:51.160
Right?

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:54.980
Emerson and Thoreau and the Lone Ranger and
the whole thing and that turns out to just

00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:56.320
be wrong.

00:28:56.320 --> 00:29:01.830
Um, or to the extent that Americans have those
kinds of cultural attitudes, we're just like

00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:03.900
people in many other countries.

00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:15.169
Uh, including Japan, Canada, the Scandinavian
nations, most of Europe.

00:29:15.169 --> 00:29:18.730
What's striking is, in fact, the places on
Earth that have the highest proportion of

00:29:18.730 --> 00:29:23.700
people living alone are the Scandinavian countries
which make the greatest contributions to the

00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:25.450
welfare state.

00:29:25.450 --> 00:29:26.850
Right?

00:29:26.850 --> 00:29:32.150
And what I came away understanding, which
I really didn't know when I started the project,

00:29:32.150 --> 00:29:39.970
is that it's by contributing to the common
good and to these commonly shared resources

00:29:39.970 --> 00:29:46.260
that we give ourselves the capacity to live
the way that feels best.

00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:53.720
Which is to say that it's our interdependence
that makes our independence possible.

00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:58.190
It's our interdependence that makes our independence
possible, that's why living alone is so much

00:29:58.190 --> 00:30:01.620
higher in countries with generous welfare
states.

00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:08.179
It's also why living alone is so much higher
in cities than it is in rural areas.

00:30:08.179 --> 00:30:14.539
Now very few people aspire to live alone,
most Americans, most people will get married

00:30:14.539 --> 00:30:15.789
at some point in their lives.

00:30:15.789 --> 00:30:20.380
My point is not, you know, this is what we
want most in life.

00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:26.280
But what's different about us today is that
we recognize that if we can't find the relationship

00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:31.640
that works for us, we can live alone and be
pretty social.

00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:37.380
You know, we can live alone and be better
than we thought we would be, even better than,

00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:42.520
you know, our aunt, or you know, our grandmother
or our friends think we're going to be.

00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:45.940
Because remember the guy in the Hopper painting
whose back is to us and we project our feelings

00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:46.940
on to him?

00:30:46.940 --> 00:30:51.549
It turns out we often do this with people
we know in our own lives who are single and

00:30:51.549 --> 00:30:54.299
aren't married, the first thing we talk to
them about it whether they've met someone

00:30:54.299 --> 00:30:56.010
and can we fix them up.

00:30:56.010 --> 00:30:59.789
Sometimes that's the right thing to do but
sometimes it's not.

00:30:59.789 --> 00:31:05.720
So I hope you understand, you know, now, why
Going Solo and not Alone in America is the

00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:06.880
title for this book.

00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:12.760
And I hope you see that, you know the birds
take you some place where you know the Ed

00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:14.080
Hopper paintings don't.

00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:18.610
And you know maybe when the paperback comes
out we'll come up with a human image that,

00:31:18.610 --> 00:31:21.289
you know, suits this story.

00:31:21.289 --> 00:31:23.970
But I hope that over lunch today I've at least
given you something to think about.

00:31:23.970 --> 00:31:27.490
So thank you very much, it's been a pleasure
talking to you.

00:31:27.490 --> 00:31:32.150
[Applause]
&gt;&gt; Eric: So I think we have some time for

00:31:32.150 --> 00:31:35.210
questions.

00:31:35.210 --> 00:31:46.890
&gt;&gt; Male #1: You said that, um, basically that
the level of dysfunction is essentially constant

00:31:46.890 --> 00:31:53.740
as a society has it moved around, I mean if
the most, you seem to say the most functional

00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:55.460
people are actually getting better.

00:31:55.460 --> 00:31:57.669
Are the least functional people getting worse?

00:31:57.669 --> 00:31:59.340
&gt;&gt; Eric: That's a good question.

00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:03.870
To be honest, I don't have the data to really
answer that question.

00:32:03.870 --> 00:32:13.170
But I do think that the we are providing less
to people who have the most trouble.

00:32:13.170 --> 00:32:14.170
And this is worrisome.

00:32:14.170 --> 00:32:21.080
So for instance, you know, when there is an
economic crisis and cities lose their funding

00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:28.580
to do a bunch of different programs, uh, they
often do things like, cut the budget for senior

00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:32.300
care, or for specialized transportation.

00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:35.409
Maybe you've followed this debate in New York
City the last several years, I write about

00:32:35.409 --> 00:32:41.730
it in the book, where the city is actually
quite generous with programs for older people

00:32:41.730 --> 00:32:43.370
and older people who live alone.

00:32:43.370 --> 00:32:47.419
And one of the great programs the city has
maintained over the years has been a Meals

00:32:47.419 --> 00:32:49.710
on Wheels program.

00:32:49.710 --> 00:32:54.429
You know, you get a hot meal delivered to
your door everyday if you're in need.

00:32:54.429 --> 00:33:01.610
Well, when times got tough and the agencies
lost funding, they said 'we've got to economize.'

00:33:01.610 --> 00:33:10.150
And one really nice way to do that is to deliver
more meals, you know, per visit, so rather

00:33:10.150 --> 00:33:14.409
than a live human being coming to knock on
your door and hand you a meal and provide

00:33:14.409 --> 00:33:22.750
a little company everyday, you might get six
frozen meals twice a week.

00:33:22.750 --> 00:33:28.240
Now that's a cold policy and I'm not talking
about the food.

00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:34.549
You know, it's a policy that fails to register
the way in which the interaction is part of

00:33:34.549 --> 00:33:37.200
what you're giving when you give a meal.

00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:41.110
That's happening in an affluent city like
New York City.

00:33:41.110 --> 00:33:44.390
Cities around the country are cutting far
more than that.

00:33:44.390 --> 00:33:52.150
And so I worry that people who live alone
and are really vulnerable and isolated are

00:33:52.150 --> 00:33:54.590
getting more vulnerable and more isolated.

00:33:54.590 --> 00:33:57.419
That really was the story of the heat wave
in Chicago.

00:33:57.419 --> 00:33:59.970
It's an invisible world in some respects.

00:33:59.970 --> 00:34:04.860
One guy I spoke with called this a secret
society of people who live and die alone.

00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:07.940
We certainly don't see it in our everyday
lives.

00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:12.349
But it's a real world and one I think we should
be concerned about.

00:34:12.349 --> 00:34:17.569
One of the things that I'm trying to think
out now is, you know, what are the implications

00:34:17.569 --> 00:34:23.759
of the aging of the boomer generation for
aging alone?

00:34:23.759 --> 00:34:28.389
We are going to have record numbers of people
who are old and living alone.

00:34:28.389 --> 00:34:34.849
Many of them had their savings you know, clipped
quite a lot, uh, by the recession and the

00:34:34.849 --> 00:34:41.159
crash in the stock market in 2008 and I fear
that we haven't figured out a way to provide

00:34:41.159 --> 00:34:47.519
the kind of care and support to older people
who are alone, uh, that we really need to

00:34:47.519 --> 00:34:48.519
do.

00:34:48.519 --> 00:34:53.841
In my family we, you know, my grandmother
who died recently, uh, needed to be in an

00:34:53.841 --> 00:34:58.000
assisted living facility and she was fortunate
enough to have you know three children who

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:01.150
could help to take care of her, uh and support
her.

00:35:01.150 --> 00:35:07.239
But it was incredibly expensive and she lived
that way for a long time, more than a decade,

00:35:07.239 --> 00:35:11.339
uh and there are not a lot of families that
can sustain that.

00:35:11.339 --> 00:35:15.779
So I think we'll collectively need to find
some way to deal with this housing issue for

00:35:15.779 --> 00:35:17.999
older people for sure.

00:35:17.999 --> 00:35:18.999
Yeah.

00:35:18.999 --> 00:35:27.279
&gt;&gt; male #2: Um, I'll throw out a couple of
comments and questions.

00:35:27.279 --> 00:35:32.630
There seems to me that there's an underlying
subtext here in your talk at least, I haven't

00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:33.779
read your book.

00:35:33.779 --> 00:35:38.349
That alone is wrong, that alone is bad.

00:35:38.349 --> 00:35:46.480
Um, and, you know, you seem to be a little
surprised that that's not always the case.

00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:50.579
And you know I don't think it seems to me
that's perhaps the reflection of a classic

00:35:50.579 --> 00:35:58.660
sort of approach of an extrovert to people
who are more introverted, not everyone finds

00:35:58.660 --> 00:36:05.469
spending, you know the most productive they
can be, or the most happy they can be is spending,

00:36:05.469 --> 00:36:08.760
you know, is being out in a bar, at a party
with a lot of people and talking.

00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:14.751
I mean a lot of us find, I don't know about
a lot of us, the world, but certainly a lot

00:36:14.751 --> 00:36:19.950
of us Google engineers, a ridiculously large
percentage of Google engineers find it exactly

00:36:19.950 --> 00:36:26.029
the opposite that there's, um, a real value
to being alone, or solo, at least some of

00:36:26.029 --> 00:36:27.499
the time.

00:36:27.499 --> 00:36:31.380
And specifically to point out one thing you
sort of threw out there.

00:36:31.380 --> 00:36:36.289
I think you made a comment, if I heard you
correctly that you know, you don't win Nobel

00:36:36.289 --> 00:36:38.359
prizes by going out to bars.

00:36:38.359 --> 00:36:43.839
&gt;&gt; Eric: No no, my that my claim to you, that
people who live alone tend to go out more

00:36:43.839 --> 00:36:46.269
was not going to win me a Nobel prize.

00:36:46.269 --> 00:36:48.929
&gt;&gt; Male 2: Oh, I'm sorry, then I completely
misunderstood that claim.

00:36:48.929 --> 00:36:51.210
&gt;&gt; Eric: Neither of us gets a Nobel today.

00:36:51.210 --> 00:36:52.839
Next, next week.

00:36:52.839 --> 00:36:55.670
OK, can I say something about this?

00:36:55.670 --> 00:37:01.630
Because, I think what you've hit on is totally
right.

00:37:01.630 --> 00:37:09.180
What I hope came across today and what I learned
in the book is my prior was that, you know,

00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:14.670
people who live alone, whether they're introverted
or not were less connected and that this is

00:37:14.670 --> 00:37:18.750
something we needed to really worry about
because they could dangerously isolated.

00:37:18.750 --> 00:37:26.219
And they were lonely people and they were
miserable living alone, I shared in that quite

00:37:26.219 --> 00:37:29.319
widespread view.

00:37:29.319 --> 00:37:36.500
And what I learned in the course of doing
this work is, I think, your prior, some of

00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:39.329
us need to learn a lot before we get someone
else's prior.

00:37:39.329 --> 00:37:45.680
Which is that in fact for many people living
alone, being alone, spending time alone works

00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:47.319
out pretty well.

00:37:47.319 --> 00:37:49.849
Much better than we conventionally think.

00:37:49.849 --> 00:37:56.059
That's why I think we need to break away from
the concept that this a social problem, only,

00:37:56.059 --> 00:37:59.349
and also recognize it as a social experiment.

00:37:59.349 --> 00:38:05.750
Now there is a difference between being alone
and spending a lot of work time alone.

00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:11.750
I'm a writer, most writers have the same thing
as, you know, Google engineers, we need to

00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:14.160
have our time with our machine.

00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:17.329
Uh, but that's different from living alone.

00:38:17.329 --> 00:38:23.859
And what's really interesting to me sociological,
anthropologically, you know, historically

00:38:23.859 --> 00:38:26.640
is that we never did this before.

00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:34.009
You know, we are involved in an experiment
that really is unprecedented and, I think,

00:38:34.009 --> 00:38:38.069
you know, my book might be the first of this
social experiment but surely there will be

00:38:38.069 --> 00:38:46.029
more, because this is a whole scale re-engineering
of what it means to organize your life, your

00:38:46.029 --> 00:38:52.140
home, um, we don't have stories to tell about
it, there's not a great you know, there's

00:38:52.140 --> 00:38:54.460
not received wisdom from centuries.

00:38:54.460 --> 00:39:00.690
There's the herme-, the tradition of hermits
and monks, but there's not much that understands

00:39:00.690 --> 00:39:03.289
what it means to live alone in an urban environment.

00:39:03.289 --> 00:39:08.089
And, you know, my book the book is really
my first cut at this, but I think this is

00:39:08.089 --> 00:39:10.400
something we'll be mulling over for a long
time.

00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:14.779
And I think that people in places like Google
will be playing in a role, playing a role

00:39:14.779 --> 00:39:22.150
in this because a lot of what shapes the quality
of your experience, uh, is your interaction

00:39:22.150 --> 00:39:26.579
with screens and with the social life that
the digital culture affords.

00:39:26.579 --> 00:39:29.690
Um, I hope you share that view.

00:39:29.690 --> 00:39:30.690
Yeah.

00:39:30.690 --> 00:39:37.630
&gt;&gt; male #3: If this trend of the people living
alone goes on for a long time, what are the

00:39:37.630 --> 00:39:42.849
long-term implications of that would be on
the society on a larger scale?

00:39:42.849 --> 00:39:48.390
Um, for example, I consider families as a
top of a social safety net that's more reliable

00:39:48.390 --> 00:39:51.039
than lets say your mutual fund.

00:39:51.039 --> 00:39:53.880
&gt;&gt; Eric: Yeah.

00:39:53.880 --> 00:40:01.099
So, there are many questions to consider here.

00:40:01.099 --> 00:40:08.099
Um, recall that in Scandinavia where living
alone is far more advanced than what it is

00:40:08.099 --> 00:40:09.099
here.

00:40:09.099 --> 00:40:13.700
In Stockholm, for instance, about 60% of the
households are one-person households.

00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:18.590
47% of households at the national level in
Sweden are one-person households, so we can

00:40:18.590 --> 00:40:26.309
see a little bit of our future in Scandinavia,
but that's if we sustained social programs

00:40:26.309 --> 00:40:30.650
and support services and a welfare state to
the level that they do there and that seems

00:40:30.650 --> 00:40:32.829
unlikely at a moment like this.

00:40:32.829 --> 00:40:34.839
It even seems unlikely there.

00:40:34.839 --> 00:40:40.930
So that's to say that you can sustain living
alone as an experience and also sustain good

00:40:40.930 --> 00:40:47.720
health and longevity if you make the commitment
to the public institutions that can do that.

00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:51.529
That's the, I'd say that's what we can learn
from the Scandinavians.

00:40:51.529 --> 00:40:56.900
If you don't do, that and you kind of privatize
it and marketize it, than you run the risk

00:40:56.900 --> 00:41:00.069
of real isolation.

00:41:00.069 --> 00:41:05.279
Because those who can't sustain themselves
will fall through the cracks.

00:41:05.279 --> 00:41:11.069
For my money, the real question about sustainability
has to do with the environment.

00:41:11.069 --> 00:41:17.769
You know, what does it mean to have so many
people with their own individual, you know,

00:41:17.769 --> 00:41:22.059
kitchens and other appliances and homes?

00:41:22.059 --> 00:41:28.339
Now, we don't have enough research to really
answer that question, so it's not at all clear

00:41:28.339 --> 00:41:34.799
to me that the carbon footprint of four single
people living in small energy efficient Manhattan

00:41:34.799 --> 00:41:40.519
apartments who use public transportation to
get to work is any bigger than the carbon

00:41:40.519 --> 00:41:45.930
footprint than the family of four in a West
Chester 3000 square foot home with you know

00:41:45.930 --> 00:41:49.459
two cars and long commutes.

00:41:49.459 --> 00:41:51.619
What's the right comparison to answer this
kind of question, you know?

00:41:51.619 --> 00:41:53.499
I don't know.

00:41:53.499 --> 00:41:59.469
Because living alone is an urban experience
mostly these days and because cities are places

00:41:59.469 --> 00:42:05.390
where we can really build a more ecologically
sustainable future, I don't think it's definitely

00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:10.400
going to be a problem, but I think this is
something we really need to watch and develop.

00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:11.400
Yeah.

00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:16.279
&gt;&gt; male #4: Going back to the introvert point,
um, I'm not sure if introverts have anything

00:42:16.279 --> 00:42:21.400
to do with this but, did you find in your
research that any specific personality traits

00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:27.829
tend to much more willingly want to live alone,
uh, than others, or is it sort of like equal

00:42:27.829 --> 00:42:31.349
opportunity for all sorts of circumstances
in life?

00:42:31.349 --> 00:42:38.309
&gt;&gt; Eric: So I have to say that, not being
a psychologist I wasn't asking questions about

00:42:38.309 --> 00:42:44.970
personality types so what I have to say next
reflects my kind of off the cuff thinking

00:42:44.970 --> 00:42:48.210
rather than careful systematic observation.

00:42:48.210 --> 00:42:57.729
Um, uh, clearly um, people who are prone to
depression and feelings of loneliness struggle

00:42:57.729 --> 00:43:01.499
more when they're on their own than others.

00:43:01.499 --> 00:43:07.849
And there is, you know, this you know vicious
circle, sort of vicious cycle, where the loneliness

00:43:07.849 --> 00:43:13.440
feeds the depression which leads to you know
withdrawing from social life which makes you

00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:17.140
more lonely and depressed and that can be
a real problem.

00:43:17.140 --> 00:43:21.430
If you have that set of personality characteristics
and you know that then living alone will be

00:43:21.430 --> 00:43:22.430
a challenge.

00:43:22.430 --> 00:43:27.489
Living alone requires, you know, learning
and developing a specific set of skills and

00:43:27.489 --> 00:43:33.309
one of those skills is to get yourself out
into the world when it feels like the world

00:43:33.309 --> 00:43:35.259
isn't making a place for you.

00:43:35.259 --> 00:43:43.190
One woman I interviewed talked about getting
her own place after you know living with roommates,

00:43:43.190 --> 00:43:44.190
um.

00:43:44.190 --> 00:43:47.059
This is real sign of success and distinction
in a city, right?

00:43:47.059 --> 00:43:51.239
You move to Manhattan you have to go to school,
you get your first job and you live with roommates,

00:43:51.239 --> 00:43:54.759
but then you can't stand your roommates after
a while so you get your own place and that

00:43:54.759 --> 00:43:59.700
means you really made it and, um, and then
she said "So, I got my own place and I was

00:43:59.700 --> 00:44:04.420
so excited and I kept thinking this was going
to be like college where the phone would ring

00:44:04.420 --> 00:44:09.200
or someone would come knocking on the door
and say ''hey come on we're all going out''

00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:10.859
but that doesn't happen.”

00:44:10.859 --> 00:44:16.380
You know that, so you have to figure out a
way to project yourself into the world and

00:44:16.380 --> 00:44:22.989
if you know you can't do that, you know, you
either have to learn that skill and she did,

00:44:22.989 --> 00:44:26.069
you know, or you have to look for some other
kind of arrangement.

00:44:26.069 --> 00:44:31.589
I think it's notable, too, um, this is not
a psychological trait so much as a social

00:44:31.589 --> 00:44:37.609
one, uh, that men tend to fare worse when
they're living alone.

00:44:37.609 --> 00:44:44.440
Um, women, not universally, but on average
just have better skills at making and maintaining

00:44:44.440 --> 00:44:48.819
relationships, that's with their family members
and also with their friends and that's true

00:44:48.819 --> 00:44:50.950
over the life course.

00:44:50.950 --> 00:44:57.979
Um, maybe with social media, you know, men
have, you know younger generations are learning

00:44:57.979 --> 00:45:03.670
new skills to connect with each other, you
know, maybe social media will provide that.

00:45:03.670 --> 00:45:05.930
I don't know, I think it's too early to tell.

00:45:05.930 --> 00:45:08.700
Um, I'm trying to look more carefully at it.

00:45:08.700 --> 00:45:11.420
Uh, but clearly living alone is not for everyone.

00:45:11.420 --> 00:45:12.420
[Silence]
&gt;&gt; Eric: Yeah, sorry.

00:45:12.420 --> 00:45:16.069
&gt;&gt; female #1: Um, just wondering [inaudible]about
how in the 50s people thought of people living

00:45:16.069 --> 00:45:26.400
alone is immoral and neurotic, did you find
any research on how people view people living

00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:28.359
alone today?

00:45:28.359 --> 00:45:36.900
&gt;&gt; Eric: It's a great question and basically,
uh, our attitudes have changed so much that

00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:39.529
social scientists don't even ask the question.

00:45:39.529 --> 00:45:43.900
You know, when you live in a moment where
half the adult population is single, you know,

00:45:43.900 --> 00:45:50.099
and a third of them live alone, you know,
those asking those questions just feels funny.

00:45:50.099 --> 00:45:54.739
Someone should, I mean I went back to the,
you know, the people who did the survey and

00:45:54.739 --> 00:45:59.140
to the a lot of the people who do survey research
on attitudes towards marriage and I tried

00:45:59.140 --> 00:46:01.779
to get this data and I couldn't do it.

00:46:01.779 --> 00:46:05.099
Um, maybe someone will.

00:46:05.099 --> 00:46:10.150
Alright, well, thank-you very much.

00:46:10.150 --> 00:46:11.150
I really enjoyed speaking with you.

00:46:11.150 --> 00:46:11.151
[Applause]
