00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.536
The next design patterns we're going to discuss, are

00:00:02.536 --> 00:00:06.630
summarization patterns. And, these are patterns that give you, some

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:10.145
quick easy high level understanding of your data. And we're

00:00:10.145 --> 00:00:12.530
going to make a distinction here. We're going to talk about making

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.050
what's called an inverted index. And this is very similar

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:17.760
to the index you'd find in a back of a

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.840
book, or the indexing that Google does when it crawls

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.990
the web. And, we're also going to talk about numerical summarizations.

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:32.600
And, these are things like finding counts, how many of a certain record type, or

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:37.980
min and max. And min and max of course, can be used to calculate first

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.140
or last. Or calculate statistics like, mean

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.600
and median, and basically any other high level

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.660
numerical value that you can use to summarize

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.084
your data set. In this section of summarization

00:00:52.084 --> 00:00:54.493
patterns, we'll also talk about some

00:00:54.493 --> 00:00:58.727
interesting additional [INAUDIBLE] functionality, something that

00:00:58.727 --> 00:01:01.574
can exist between [INAUDIBLE] reducers, known

00:01:01.574 --> 00:01:03.330
as combiners. So, let's keep going.
