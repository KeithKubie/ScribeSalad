00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.840
PROFESSOR: Let's get started.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.500
Settle down.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:25.970
Settle down.

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:27.550
Welcome to 3.091.

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.980
I'm Donald Sadoway and I'm going
to be your instructor

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:31.720
this semester.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:37.030
So what I want to do today
is to introduce my plans.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.270
I've got plans for you.

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.570
Plans for learning.

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.860
I want to talk a little bit
today about those plans,

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:50.630
introduce myself, introduce
my class curriculum--

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:52.900
the path forward.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:58.280
So let me begin by saying that
3.091 is the most important

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.720
class you will take at MIT.

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:04.800
It's true.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.470
But, you know, anybody who
stands in front of you to

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.195
lecture should say the same
thing about his or her class.

00:01:11.195 --> 00:01:14.180
If they don't believe that they
shouldn't be standing in

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.830
front of you lecturing.

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.651
The difference is when
I say it, I'm right.

00:01:18.651 --> 00:01:20.860
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.650
PROFESSOR: And it's not just
an opinion, it's because of

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.330
the content of 3.091.

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.130
3.091 is about chemistry.

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.900
It's about the central science,
but it's not just

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.220
about any old chemistry.

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.640
This isn't a class that you
could take anywhere else in

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.710
this country.

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.320
This is the only place that
you can take 3.091.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.830
3.091 is solid state
chemistry.

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.420
Now why do we talk about
solid state chemistry?

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.730
Because engineering systems
are made of solids.

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.030
Now I know what you're
thinking-- oh, he said solid

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.520
state, he's going to talk
about the chemistry that

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.900
constitutes his laptop computer
or the chemistry that

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.130
constitutes this
laser pointer.

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.870
And that's true.

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.930
We will talk about
that chemistry.

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.210
But we will also talk
about soft matter.

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.930
We as human beings are
chemical machines.

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:15.160
When this hand changes shape,
it is a polymer that is

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.410
changing conformality.

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.830
These eyes are photodetectors,
band gap of about

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.720
two electron volts.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.495
They're not made of
gallium nitride.

00:02:28.495 --> 00:02:32.760
They're made of organic
compounds.

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.360
Inside, what supports us,
it's a ceramic skeleton.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.650
So solid state chemistry
describes

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.590
life science as well.

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:45.740
Well, what we're going
to learn in

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.260
3.091 is the rudiments.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.550
We're going to learn
the rudiments.

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.860
So what I'm going to do today is
now go through some of the

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.760
basic organization.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.860
So tomorrow you're going
to meet your recitation

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.000
instructors and get to know each
other and get to know the

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.960
recitation instructor.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.990
Today I'll say a few words about
myself so you know who's

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:06.590
standing in front of you.

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.300
I graduated from the University
of Toronto in

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:15.830
chemical metallurgy, came down
here in 1977 to spend a year

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:22.320
as a postdoctoral fellow and, I
guess, I lost track of time.

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:23.300
Now what's my research?

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.090
My research is in
electrochemistry.

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:31.510
Electrochemistry is the most
important branch of chemistry.

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.180
Do you notice some theme in
my professional life?

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.640
See, I have tenure.

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:37.560
So what does that mean?

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.120
It means you find your passion
and pursue it.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.190
You don't waste time on
trivia, all right?

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.090
And that's what I urge
you to do: Find your

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.972
passion and pursue it.

00:03:48.972 --> 00:03:50.400
So what's my passion?

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.640
My passion is electrochemistry
in nonaqueous media.

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:54.920
Anything but water.

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.002
Let the rest of the world
work on water.

00:03:57.002 --> 00:03:59.610
I work on molten salts, ionic
liquids, and polymers.

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:00.920
And what's the reason
for this?

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:01.950
There's an application.

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.230
I'm in the School
of Engineering.

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.300
So I'm interested in
environmentally sound

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.430
technologies for metal
production, all right?

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.630
Right now looking at titanium,
iron recycling as well.

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:16.280
I'm also interested in
electrochemistry as it applies

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.010
to energy storage, energy
storage for mobile power.

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:20.870
See this gal here?

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:21.980
She's got the cell phone.

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.230
She's not even looking
where she's driving.

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:26.790
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:30.100
PROFESSOR: So making safe
batteries out of

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:35.220
earth-abundant, accessible
materials for portable power,

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.930
ultimately to drive the car with
electrons, electric fuel,

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.110
to eliminate this country's

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.710
dependence on imported petroleum.

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:46.220
We can do it.

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:46.970
How?

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:48.610
By inventing.

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:49.890
By inventing.

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:52.690
And the way we're going to
invent is to learn the lessons

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:56.160
in 3.091 that will give us the
chemistry we need to invent a

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.380
battery that can send that car
250 miles on a single charge,

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:03.340
and put it in a show room for
the same price as a car with

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.660
an internal combustion engine.

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:08.170
The only thing that stands
between that image and where

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:12.930
we are today is invention, and
the requisite material is

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:14.550
right here in this class.

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:17.380
We're also looking at
colossal batteries.

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:18.850
Store the grid.

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:22.600
Enable renewables,
wind, solar.

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.130
And then, lastly, let's never
forget about dreaming.

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:30.050
So if we want to dream and
imagine that man will return

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:32.100
to the moon or maybe even go to
Mars, we're going to have

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:33.642
to be able to produce oxygen.

00:05:33.642 --> 00:05:36.790
We'll live like the pioneers,
produce oxygen from local

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:40.540
resources, produce structural
metals, and even produce

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:43.190
photovoltaic silicon so they can
generate their own energy

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:45.240
from local resources.

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:53.580
And so electrochemistry is the
key enabler for that as well.

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:58.860
So now let's turn to the whole
underpinning of 3.091.

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:02.010
If we take a look at the
performance of any engineering

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:04.990
system it's a combination
of the design and the

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:06.480
construction.

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:09.270
Now the construction is both the
workmanship and the choice

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:10.060
of materials.

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:11.630
Now how do we choose
materials?

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:14.350
We choose them on the basis
of their properties.

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:16.040
So, for example, here's an

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:18.030
application: a beverage container.

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:21.520
This one I'm holding is made
out of an aluminum alloy.

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:22.910
It's a metal.

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:25.540
When I was your age, they
had steel beverage cans.

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:28.340
You can take this same beverage
and contain it in a

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:30.190
glass bottle.

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:35.790
You can contain it in
a polymer bottle.

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:37.530
Why do we make those
various choices?

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:40.040
Because they have the right
mix of properties.

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.040
Now how do you determine
the properties?

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:45.582
Properties obviously are
determined by the composition.

00:06:45.582 --> 00:06:50.050
We wouldn't make this thing
out of sodium chloride.

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:52.080
It would dissolve.

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.580
So composition is important,
but atomic arrangement is

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:56.090
important as well.

00:06:56.090 --> 00:07:02.350
Example is 1/2-inch-thick
pine board compared to a

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:05.210
1/2-inch-thick piece
of plywood.

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:08.280
Both pine, but the
1/2-inch-thick pine board is

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:10.250
one solid pine board.

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:13.720
I can take that pine board and
I can fracture it if I strike

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:15.150
it along the grain.

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:17.510
But the 1/2-inch-thick plywood,
I can't do that

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:22.610
because it's 1/8-inch sheet
pine cross-laminated.

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:32.820
1/8 inch north-south, 1/8 inch
east-west. If I try to cut

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:37.260
through that board, I can't
advance the fracture.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.350
Same composition, different
atomic arrangement.

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:44.475
So the thesis of 3.091 is that
the electronic structure of

00:07:44.475 --> 00:07:47.590
the elements holds the key
to understanding that

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:50.510
relationship between
composition, atomic

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:51.730
arrangement, and properties.

00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:53.000
And once you have properties
that's how

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.210
you make your selection.

00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:54.910
And away we go.

00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:57.310
And that's how we got the
syllabus of 3.091.

00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:59.180
So the syllabus has
two major blocks.

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:01.730
The first block is general
principles of chemistry-- it's

00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:03.660
going to be about the
first five weeks--

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:07.520
and that's the same stuff that
you get here, 5.111, 5.112,

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:10.030
the basics of electronic
structure and bonding.

00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:14.680
And then we part company and
in 3.091 we dig down into

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:16.240
solid state chemistry.

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:17.210
You don't have to take notes.

00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:18.040
You can relax.

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:20.920
All this is going to be
burned to PDF and

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:22.280
posted at the website.

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:25.240
So everything that you see in
this class that goes up on the

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:28.280
screen is archived for you.

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:31.830
This lecture is being video
recorded right now and within

00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:34.330
an hour will be posted
at the website.

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:38.490
So in the unlikely event that
you can't quite come to class,

00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:39.650
it is available.

00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:40.900
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:48.000
PROFESSOR: So now what I want to
do is introduce some of the

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.840
operational aspects
of the class.

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:52.040
And we had some handouts
going around.

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:53.930
If you didn't get them we
can get you extras.

00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:56.010
But again, this is all posted
at the website.

00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:58.720
So you know who I am.

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:03.180
The key person in this operation
is my administrative

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:05.580
assistant, Hilary Sheldon, and
she's just down the hall.

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:07.280
You can roll a penny down
the hall from here

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:08.240
and get to my office.

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:10.300
So if you tell me you tried
looking for me, you couldn't

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:14.060
find me, I know you couldn't
have been trying very hard.

00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:19.660
The text is a two-volume set
consisting of the text

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:22.390
Chemistry: Principles, Patterns,
and Applications by

00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:26.310
Averill and Eldredge, and then
a second volume that consists

00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:29.460
of miscellaneous readings
taken from other

00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:31.300
Prentice Hall texts.

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:35.640
And it's identical in content to
the blue book that was used

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:37.170
last year and the year before.

00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:39.330
So if you get a copy of
that blue book, you

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:40.730
don't have to buy these.

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:43.450
I don't work for Prentice Hall,
I'm not trying to sell

00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:48.110
books, but we will take the
homeworks out of the books to

00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:49.230
a great extent.

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:53.860
And the page numbering is the
same, so anything this year or

00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:55.740
the last two years
will be fine.

00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:57.310
If you have to buy something,
you'll have this.

00:09:57.310 --> 00:10:01.050
This one will come with a CD
that will get you into a

00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:04.850
mastering chemistry, which
is a sort of a tutorial,

00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:09.080
computerized system to help
you with certain homework

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:10.740
problems.

00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:13.370
The lectures, Monday, Wednesday,
Friday, here in

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:15.850
this room at 11 o'clock.

00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:18.430
The lecture starts at five
minutes after the hour--

00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:20.320
gives you five minutes
to get in--

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:22.240
and then the lecture
stops at five

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:24.580
minutes to the next hour--

00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:27.790
time for you to leave and then
for the next class to arrive.

00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:30.700
And what I'm going to try
to do is establish

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:32.220
some plug flow here.

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:35.150
So what I'm going to try is to
have everybody leave by the

00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:38.870
exit to the north here to my
right, and there's also an

00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:41.520
exit over the top back.

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:46.560
So leave to your left and that
way it'll be easier for the

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:47.650
next class to come in.

00:10:47.650 --> 00:10:50.100
And maybe we can persuade the
people here before us to do

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:51.990
the same and then it'll
be easy to change.

00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:54.260
I don't know why but there's
this sort of-- everybody has

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:55.440
to charge to this door.

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:57.380
And I just stand here and
watch people collide.

00:10:57.380 --> 00:10:59.200
And I don't know.

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:00.990
Just interesting social
experiment.

00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:02.040
And there are two doors.

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:06.010
I don't understand why people
do this, but I'm not in the

00:11:06.010 --> 00:11:08.390
social sciences.

00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:09.210
Recitations.

00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:12.430
Recitations will meet Tuesdays
and Thursdays.

00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:16.130
So you'll go to the same hour
on Tuesday and Thursday.

00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:19.580
The section should be
roughly 20 students.

00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:22.000
And that's where the question
and answer occurs.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.020
Here it's largely I
talk, you listen.

00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:27.900
I've got time for a question
like, hey, shouldn't that be a

00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:28.600
minus sign?

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:29.990
I can take something
really quick.

00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:34.360
But where you get to really
interact with the instructor

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:36.410
is in recitation.

00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:41.200
And I've given a direction to my
recitation instructors not

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:43.310
to give you a fourth
and fifth lecture.

00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:46.160
You control the content
of the recitation.

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:47.870
So you have to come
to the recitation

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:49.520
prepared with questions.

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:51.470
So they're supposed to walk in
and say, good morning, good

00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:53.810
afternoon, what are
your questions?

00:11:53.810 --> 00:11:55.950
And you can say, I didn't
understand the last five

00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:58.230
minutes of the lecture
yesterday.

00:11:58.230 --> 00:12:01.020
Would you do number five
on the homework?

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:03.600
Would you go over secondary
bonding?

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:04.940
That's the sort of thing
that's supposed

00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:08.030
to happen in section.

00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:10.660
You've been assigned
by the Registrar.

00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:14.850
You are forbidden to change
your section on your own.

00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:17.140
You can't just squat
in another section.

00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:19.740
We do this with the intention
of trying to keep the

00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:21.790
enrollment roughly uniform.

00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:25.600
We don't want sections growing
to 35 because then that limits

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:27.460
your ability to interact.

00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:31.370
If you've changed classes or
you've picked up a UROP, or

00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:34.810
what have you, and your
situation has changed, please

00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:38.860
go down the hall and meet with
my assistant Hilary, who will

00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:40.780
then arrange to move you.

00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:44.120
And that way we can keep some
control over the section size.

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:47.500
Again, you may not change
simply on your own.

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:49.830
And it has to be with cause,
academic cause.

00:12:49.830 --> 00:12:52.820
You can't go in and say, I was
assigned to the 9:00 am

00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:54.810
section and I don't
do mornings.

00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:58.150
That's not going to work.

00:12:58.150 --> 00:12:59.360
Homework.

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:00.930
Homework is very
important here.

00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:04.290
Homework is a little bit
different, though, in 3.091.

00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:07.410
You're not going to be
asked to turn in

00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:09.710
homework for grading.

00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:13.420
Instead, at the beginning of
each unit, you will be given

00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:15.780
homework with the
model solutions

00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:17.900
right at the beginning.

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:21.660
This is a study aid, and you can
use the model solutions to

00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:25.140
help you understand the
homework material.

00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:28.730
Now since we're not asking you
to turn anything in and we do

00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:32.340
want to stimulate interest in
the homework, we found a way

00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:35.560
to stimulate interest. And that
is that once a week in

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:38.000
section you will have
a 10-minute quiz

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.500
based on the homework.

00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:40.810
That will ensure that
you've at least

00:13:40.810 --> 00:13:42.370
looked at the homework.

00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:47.350
And those weekly quizzes will
be graded, and the aggregate

00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:51.820
of all of those quiz scores will
constitute your homework

00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:53.970
grade in the subject.

00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:56.010
And you must take
those quizzes.

00:13:56.010 --> 00:13:57.350
If you don't take the quiz--

00:13:57.350 --> 00:14:00.675
you got sick or some personal
emergency came up-- contact

00:14:00.675 --> 00:14:04.260
your recitation instructor and
within a week of the date of

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:08.250
the original quiz arrange
to take a makeup.

00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:09.740
If you don't take the
makeup, we're going

00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:11.150
to give you a zero.

00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:13.720
And there's no dropping
of lowest score.

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:17.070
Somewhere there's this in the
lore here that, oh, you can

00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:19.370
drop the lowest score, the
lowest two scores.

00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:23.105
People come to me with this
proposal and I say no.

00:14:23.105 --> 00:14:24.355
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:30.600
PROFESSOR: So let's
get started.

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:31.850
This is homework number one.

00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:33.160
It's assigned today.

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:35.800
We're going to save paper--
just go to the website--

00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:39.270
and you'll be tested on
Tuesday, next Tuesday,

00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:42.460
September 15, at the beginning
of section.

00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:44.710
At the beginning of section
there'll be a 10-minute quiz

00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:47.520
based on that homework,
and you can get the

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:48.380
homework and so on.

00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:51.760
By the way, here's what the
homework looks like.

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:55.130
Chapter 1, Chapter
3 of Averill.

00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:57.440
Averill is the major text.

00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:01.230
We just refer to it by the
author's last name.

00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:04.320
So taken from Averill.

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:08.730
By the way, I don't like to
use this unpleasant term

00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:12.120
"test." I like to refer to it as
a celebration of learning.

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:13.520
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:15.290
PROFESSOR: So it's
a celebration.

00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:18.960
We're going to start celebrating
on Tuesday.

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:20.310
There's the website
by the way.

00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:21.790
You probably want to
bookmark that.

00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:24.180
You're probably going
to go to that a lot.

00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:31.070
We're going to keep celebrating,
and so we will

00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:34.500
have some monthly celebrations,
monthly tests,

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:35.920
and they've already
been scheduled.

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:40.990
And you will write those tests
during the normal class time.

00:15:40.990 --> 00:15:43.430
But on those days we will
spread you out a bit.

00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:45.220
I like to see some vacancies.

00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:48.580
So you will not be sitting
one next to another.

00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:51.830
There'll be at least one human
vacancy next to every human,

00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:55.110
and that way you've got room to
spread out, keep your eyes

00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:55.740
on your own work.

00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:57.920
So those are the dates
and there'll be

00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:00.360
more of that in time.

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:05.040
Now when you take the monthly
test, I allow you to use aids.

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:09.280
So everyone will be given in
recitation tomorrow a Periodic

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:12.900
Table of the Elements, very
nice one, laminated one.

00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:16.250
So you take that with you to the
test. In fact, you should

00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:17.490
take this with you everywhere.

00:16:17.490 --> 00:16:18.840
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:20.800
PROFESSOR: If I run into you at
Harvard Square, I want to

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:24.910
see the Periodic Table, because
every educated person

00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:27.360
has the Periodic Table.

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:28.700
You get a table of constants.

00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:29.700
So you'll have one of these.

00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:31.060
You'll get that tomorrow
as well.

00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:33.400
Paper copy, and on there are all
the constants so you don't

00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:37.020
have to remember that the
permittivity of vacuum is 8.85

00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:38.970
times 10 to the minus
12 farads per meter.

00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:40.160
It's on there.

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:42.470
I urge you to use that when
you do your homework.

00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:45.240
So it's always amusing to me
during the time of the first

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:48.780
monthly celebration, somebody's
looking at this as

00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:51.690
though it's today's newspaper
and they're

00:16:51.690 --> 00:16:54.910
looking, where is that?

00:16:54.910 --> 00:16:57.650
Sort of revealing about the
intensity with which the

00:16:57.650 --> 00:17:00.070
homework has been embraced.

00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:02.440
Calculator, something to
calculate with, and I don't

00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:04.370
care if you bring in a graphing

00:17:04.370 --> 00:17:06.770
calculator or a mainframe.

00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:07.650
I don't care.

00:17:07.650 --> 00:17:08.550
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:11.370
PROFESSOR: And you're allowed
an aid sheet, an 8 1/2-by-11

00:17:11.370 --> 00:17:12.020
sheet of paper.

00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:13.260
And you can write on
the front, you can

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:14.560
write on the back.

00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:20.090
You can photoreduce previous
exams down to micro-dot size.

00:17:20.090 --> 00:17:24.420
I don't care what you put on
it, but with this, you have

00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:27.130
then no excuse to say I really
understood this stuff, but I

00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:28.500
couldn't remember a formula.

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:31.640
Actually, many students tell me
that the act of preparing

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:35.730
the aid sheet organizes the
subject matter in their minds.

00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:38.530
They bring this with them to
the exam, and they never

00:17:38.530 --> 00:17:40.950
consult it, but it just soothes
the nerves and makes

00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:47.200
sure that everybody does well
on the monthly test.

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:48.460
The weekly test, no.

00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:51.380
The weekly test you bring your
Periodic Table and table of

00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:52.970
constants, but no aid sheet.

00:17:52.970 --> 00:17:55.490
For the weekly test,
it's a very

00:17:55.490 --> 00:17:57.990
concentrated amount of material.

00:17:57.990 --> 00:18:01.530
And I'm not going to test your
memories, because that doesn't

00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:04.850
prove anything to me.

00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:07.020
And then, of course, the
celebration of celebrations is

00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:07.750
the final exam.

00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:08.730
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:09.860
PROFESSOR: That's huge.

00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:11.700
That's a huge celebration.

00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:13.660
It's three hours.

00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:15.510
See, these are really
50 minutes.

00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:18.080
This is three full hours.

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:20.470
The time and location will
be set by the Registrar.

00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:22.530
We should know by October 1.

00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:25.780
The final exam period is
December 14 to 18.

00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:30.660
And so what I urge you to do
is as soon as that schedule

00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:34.270
comes out and we know when all
the final exams are going to

00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:38.650
be held, then you book your
passage for the holidays.

00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:40.820
Do not get that order
reversed.

00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:43.400
You cannot come to me and
say, I got a really

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:44.690
good price on a ticket.

00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:48.430
I'm going Acapulco on the 15th
of December, and your exam is

00:18:48.430 --> 00:18:49.670
on the 16th of December.

00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:52.760
I'll say, you just got
a zero on the final.

00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:54.380
You have to be here for that.

00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:55.030
You know why?

00:18:55.030 --> 00:18:59.740
I have to be here for that, you
can be here for that, too.

00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:02.130
There are about a quarter of a
million students in Boston.

00:19:02.130 --> 00:19:05.030
It's a great college town, but
at Christmas time, it's

00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:06.740
pandemonium at Logan Airport.

00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:09.690
So you want to book your passage
early, but you can't

00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:14.060
do it until you know what your
final exam obligations are.

00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:14.750
Grading.

00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:17.700
Freshman, you know, it's
pass/no record.

00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:19.320
Pass/no record.

00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:22.710
And so that means that if you
struggle and things don't go

00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:25.300
well, you don't have any
blemishes on your record.

00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:28.450
Unfortunately, some of the
upperclassmen will tell you as

00:19:28.450 --> 00:19:30.630
pass/no record, you
now, barest pass

00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:32.570
imaginable/ no record.

00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:36.270
Well, I hate to let you know
this, but increasingly I am

00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:41.730
being asked by medical
schools, law schools,

00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:45.760
scholarship providers to reveal
the scores on the

00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:47.590
freshman year.

00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:52.240
So think about that before you
call Hilary in late November

00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:54.910
saying, what do I need
to get a 50?

00:19:54.910 --> 00:19:59.250
I need a 32 on the final?

00:19:59.250 --> 00:20:00.480
OK.

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:04.628
But Lord help you, you
get a 31 you go down.

00:20:04.628 --> 00:20:06.970
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:06.970 --> 00:20:09.470
PROFESSOR: Upperclassmen get
the luxury of the entire

00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:13.320
alphabet: A, B, C, D, F.

00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:15.420
The final grade composition.

00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:16.730
1/6 for homework--

00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:20.140
that's the aggregates of the
weekly test scores-- and 1/6

00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:22.140
for each of the three tests.

00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:25.590
And then the final
is 2/6, or 1/3.

00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:27.670
I didn't want to get into
transcendental numbers, so I

00:20:27.670 --> 00:20:31.630
made it 33 exact, 16.75 exact.

00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:35.650
I could have made it 16.77, I
could have made it 16.81, I

00:20:35.650 --> 00:20:36.740
could have made it
anything I want.

00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:39.040
I'm the professor.

00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:42.520
But I chose 16.75.

00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:48.040
Bottom line here is it's really
dumb to fail the final.

00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:51.600
If you passed the final, you're
pretty much assured

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:53.630
that we're going
to be favorably

00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:55.610
disposed to passing you.

00:20:55.610 --> 00:20:58.830
But you fail the final
that says two things.

00:20:58.830 --> 00:21:02.980
It says, number one, you don't
have a grasp of the overall

00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:05.610
year, but it also sort of
indicates that you ran out of

00:21:05.610 --> 00:21:08.780
steam partway through the
semester and stopped working.

00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:11.590
It's very bad.

00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:13.830
You get a lot of good advice
from upperclassmen, but

00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:15.590
sometimes--

00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:17.810
I'd ignore that one that says,
hey, you don't have to do that

00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:19.980
well on the final.

00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:22.460
Anyway, so you have to
get a C level as

00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:23.640
a freshmen or greater.

00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:27.080
And, by the way, we do
not grade on a curve.

00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:30.110
I've seen it in magazines
this last year that

00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:31.910
MIT grades on a curve.

00:21:31.910 --> 00:21:32.970
I don't where they
get that from.

00:21:32.970 --> 00:21:34.320
I don't grade on a curve.

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:39.200
Your success does not come at
the expense of your neighbor.

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:41.040
As far as I'm concerned
everybody in this

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:42.420
class can get an A.

00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:46.550
Again, I'm the professor,
all right?

00:21:46.550 --> 00:21:49.600
So you say, well, how
do you know that 50

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:50.420
is the right number?

00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:51.720
Why isn't it 55?

00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:53.470
Why isn't it 75?

00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:54.710
Well, I know.

00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:54.960
I know.

00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:55.940
How do I know?

00:21:55.940 --> 00:22:01.610
Because when we grade, we set up
the point scheme so that if

00:22:01.610 --> 00:22:07.720
the student has the mastery of
the barest level of competency

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:10.140
of the key concept the
point scheme must

00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:11.340
reflect a passing grade--

00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:14.090
5 out of 10, 5 out of 9--

00:22:14.090 --> 00:22:16.380
and you propagate
that through.

00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:18.800
I don't care how much is
written, if it doesn't

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:22.440
demonstrate basic mastery of
the key concept the point

00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:28.310
scheme must give 4, 3, 2, 0.

00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:29.610
Maybe a 1.

00:22:29.610 --> 00:22:33.440
And so that, if you propagate it
through the whole semester,

00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:34.770
means 50 is a pass.

00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:35.950
There's some wiggle
room there.

00:22:35.950 --> 00:22:40.180
How do I know 49.7 is a
fail and 50 is a pass?

00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:43.070
That's when I call your
recitation instructor.

00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:44.320
[CELL PHONE RINGING]

00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:45.190
PROFESSOR: Let's kill that.

00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:47.150
We're going to get to
that in a second.

00:22:47.150 --> 00:22:49.036
Let's call the recitation
instructor.

00:22:49.036 --> 00:22:51.360
And what happens?

00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:53.500
I ask the recitation instructor,
well, what can you

00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:55.540
tell me about this young lady?

00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:58.090
And, oh, she came to all my
classes, she tried really

00:22:58.090 --> 00:22:59.990
hard, she came to
office hours.

00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:02.690
I don't think the exam is a
proper reflection of her

00:23:02.690 --> 00:23:04.270
understanding.

00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:08.170
I'll listen to that and
maybe we'll promote.

00:23:08.170 --> 00:23:11.710
If, on the other hand, I get the
response, I never saw her,

00:23:11.710 --> 00:23:13.390
didn't come to class.

00:23:13.390 --> 00:23:18.220
I repeatedly reached out to her,
ignored my entreaties,

00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:19.586
she's going down.

00:23:19.586 --> 00:23:20.836
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:26.010
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:23:26.010 --> 00:23:26.970
Website.

00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:28.795
This is what the website
looks like.

00:23:28.795 --> 00:23:30.980
There's a number of tabs here.

00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:35.140
The readings are there, the
videos are there archived.

00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:36.310
The schedule--

00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:38.150
what's going to be coming up.

00:23:38.150 --> 00:23:40.220
So, for example, this is
what's going on today.

00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:44.460
It says what the topic is,
roughly what the readings are.

00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:46.580
I know today you didn't come
to class having read.

00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:47.880
And it's OK, we'll
get through it.

00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:52.970
But from now on I urge you
to do the readings.

00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:56.640
A couple of topics I'm required
to talk about.

00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:58.620
My management requires
me to do so.

00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:00.220
Academic honesty.

00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:03.290
There's a lot of texts here,
but in plain English, this

00:24:03.290 --> 00:24:05.300
says don't cheat!

00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:06.995
You know what this means!

00:24:06.995 --> 00:24:09.270
Now I don't want to hear,
well, in my country, the

00:24:09.270 --> 00:24:09.680
custom is--

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:11.690
I don't care what they
do in your country!

00:24:11.690 --> 00:24:15.780
You're in my class, and if
you cheat in my class you

00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:19.000
will pay for it.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:20.620
Very simple.

00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:23.140
Accept information of any
kind from others--

00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:24.630
wrong.

00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:27.940
Represent somebody else's work
as your own-- wrong.

00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:29.100
You know this.

00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:33.350
It was Juvenal, the Roman
politician, said men need not

00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:37.020
so much be instructed
as reminded.

00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:40.230
I'm not telling you anything
you don't already know, but

00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:43.150
I'm going to say it so no one
can say, well, nobody told us

00:24:43.150 --> 00:24:47.000
it wasn't OK to erase our
answers and hand them back in

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.440
for more points.

00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:50.020
I just did.

00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:51.270
All right?

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:57.630
So if in the unlikely-- but
it happens every so often.

00:24:57.630 --> 00:25:00.050
Maybe every two, three years.

00:25:00.050 --> 00:25:00.980
And people get caught.

00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:02.180
You know why they get caught?

00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:04.470
Because for the first time in
your life you're being taught

00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:06.545
by people who are as
smart as you are.

00:25:06.545 --> 00:25:07.795
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:15.280
PROFESSOR: My TAs are
really smart.

00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:18.700
And it never ceases to amaze
me-- somebody succumbs and

00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:21.630
does something dishonest,
and they get caught!

00:25:21.630 --> 00:25:23.080
They get busted!

00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:24.370
And what happens then?

00:25:24.370 --> 00:25:25.210
Then I get angry.

00:25:25.210 --> 00:25:25.900
You know why?

00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:29.150
Because we can't settle
that in my office.

00:25:29.150 --> 00:25:32.930
You can't come and
cry in my office.

00:25:32.930 --> 00:25:39.310
I have to take this episode to a
committee here at MIT called

00:25:39.310 --> 00:25:40.610
the Committee on Discipline.

00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:42.760
It is staffed by faculty, by

00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:45.500
administrators, and by students.

00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:49.490
And the case is brought before
the COD at a hearing and a

00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:51.370
punishment is decided.

00:25:51.370 --> 00:25:55.540
And it can be anything from
suspension to expulsion.

00:25:55.540 --> 00:25:59.350
And of the three categories,
faculty, administrators,

00:25:59.350 --> 00:26:04.700
students, which category do you
think is most severe on

00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:05.910
infringers?

00:26:05.910 --> 00:26:06.670
AUDIENCE: Students.

00:26:06.670 --> 00:26:07.870
PROFESSOR: Your peers.

00:26:07.870 --> 00:26:09.050
You got it.

00:26:09.050 --> 00:26:12.002
You know, because people my age,
old faculty, they'll be

00:26:12.002 --> 00:26:14.520
like, oh, they're just
kids, whatever.

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:16.710
The students say, no!

00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:18.005
Throw them out!

00:26:18.005 --> 00:26:19.255
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:24.090
PROFESSOR: So it's not going to
be me that's going to expel

00:26:24.090 --> 00:26:26.490
you, it's going to
be your peers.

00:26:26.490 --> 00:26:27.260
So don't do it.

00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:29.890
And if you're ever in an exam
and somebody's pressuring you,

00:26:29.890 --> 00:26:33.190
just raise your hand and
ask to be reseated.

00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:35.980
For all I know, the guy next to
you has got a bad case of

00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:37.830
B.O., you just want to move.

00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:39.810
We will not ask any
questions, so take

00:26:39.810 --> 00:26:41.530
yourself out of the situation.

00:26:41.530 --> 00:26:45.580
Conduct yourself
appropriately.

00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:46.870
Classroom behavior.

00:26:46.870 --> 00:26:48.440
Now this is the first lecture,
there's a whole bunch of

00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:49.880
violations in here right now.

00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:52.540
So I'm going to say it now and
we'll fix it for next time.

00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:57.980
We've got 425 seats here, we've
probably got 475 people,

00:26:57.980 --> 00:27:00.210
and there's only one way we can
make this system work and

00:27:00.210 --> 00:27:04.210
we have to observe certain
rules of decorum.

00:27:04.210 --> 00:27:06.280
And I make the rules.

00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:09.930
So if I want to maintain a
fertile learning environment

00:27:09.930 --> 00:27:13.080
I'm going to ask for these
rules to be observed.

00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:15.610
No talking at all.

00:27:15.610 --> 00:27:16.500
No talking.

00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:19.120
Little conversation here, little
conversation here--

00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:21.480
it disturbs people.

00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:23.640
I don't want any
food or drink.

00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:25.750
No food, no drink.

00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:27.914
One exception is
the professor.

00:27:27.914 --> 00:27:30.520
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:34.070
PROFESSOR: Because I do not want
to have my throat get so

00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:37.460
dry that I can't finish talking
my way through the end

00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:38.680
of the class.

00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:42.350
Otherwise, no food or drink and
no disruptive behavior.

00:27:42.350 --> 00:27:44.540
No horseplay or anything
like that.

00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:49.040
And wireless communication
devices must be silenced.

00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:52.890
Cell phone goes off, you get
up, you leave the room.

00:27:52.890 --> 00:27:54.751
That's it.

00:27:54.751 --> 00:27:56.620
AUDIENCE: Is water OK?

00:27:56.620 --> 00:27:58.600
PROFESSOR: If you need water
because it's some kind of a

00:27:58.600 --> 00:27:59.440
health thing, fine.

00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:01.630
But I do not want to see a whole
bunch of people drawing

00:28:01.630 --> 00:28:03.470
on water bottles.

00:28:03.470 --> 00:28:04.910
Don't need it.

00:28:04.910 --> 00:28:06.560
Don't need it.

00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:10.230
You can go 50 minutes without
your little--

00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:11.157
whatever.

00:28:11.157 --> 00:28:13.780
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:15.270
PROFESSOR: You know why?

00:28:15.270 --> 00:28:16.200
I'll tell you why.

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:19.270
It's not because I'm trying
to be a control freak.

00:28:19.270 --> 00:28:22.730
This is a chemistry class, but
it's chemistry-centered.

00:28:22.730 --> 00:28:26.470
You didn't just come to MIT to
learn some geeky techno stuff.

00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:29.180
You're preparing for a
professional career, and part

00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:34.450
of that is how you behave, how
to act as a professional.

00:28:34.450 --> 00:28:37.880
And you cannot learn behavior
by doing problem sets.

00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:39.320
How do you learn behavior?

00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:41.980
You learn behavior
by observation.

00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:43.710
And how does one
teach behavior?

00:28:43.710 --> 00:28:45.270
By modeling.

00:28:45.270 --> 00:28:47.570
If you're in some high-level
committee meeting and all of a

00:28:47.570 --> 00:28:49.377
sudden your cell phone goes off
and you're scrambling and

00:28:49.377 --> 00:28:52.220
you can't find the damn thing,
it's in the bottom of your

00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:53.700
briefcase, right?

00:28:58.930 --> 00:29:03.070
I can't tell you how
vulgar that is.

00:29:03.070 --> 00:29:05.190
You're in a professional
setting, you commit

00:29:05.190 --> 00:29:07.090
professional suicide.

00:29:07.090 --> 00:29:08.640
And I need to tell you that.

00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:13.170
If you think it's
OK you're wrong.

00:29:13.170 --> 00:29:15.310
So let's get in the habit.

00:29:15.310 --> 00:29:17.180
Disable the damn thing.

00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:17.720
What do you need?

00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:19.110
You're going to call
your stockbroker?

00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:22.760
What's so important right now?

00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:27.220
And on an exam, that thing goes
off I take the exam in

00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:28.050
front of everybody and--

00:29:28.050 --> 00:29:29.330
[MAKING RIPPING NOISE]

00:29:29.330 --> 00:29:33.277
PROFESSOR: --we introduce a
defect, it's called a tear.

00:29:33.277 --> 00:29:34.710
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:37.060
PROFESSOR: And then I put a zero
on it like this, with a

00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:37.972
circle around it.

00:29:37.972 --> 00:29:39.405
It's called a donut.

00:29:39.405 --> 00:29:40.655
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:45.900
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:48.120
Now let's talk about
some lighter

00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:50.040
things, more upbeat things.

00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:53.130
Look, I want you to succeed
in this class.

00:29:53.130 --> 00:29:56.670
Now how are we going
to succeed?

00:29:56.670 --> 00:29:59.700
You go to the listing
in the bulletin

00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:01.750
you'll see this, right?

00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:04.090
And you zoom in here
it says 5-0-7.

00:30:04.090 --> 00:30:04.840
What's this mean?

00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:06.800
Well the 5 is 5 contact hours.

00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:09.990
3 here and 2 with
your recitation.

00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:11.290
The 0 is lab.

00:30:11.290 --> 00:30:12.920
There's no lab with
this class.

00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:14.720
So what's the 7?

00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:17.780
The 7 is the reading,
the homework,

00:30:17.780 --> 00:30:19.500
preparation, et cetera.

00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:23.430
I pledge to you, you give me 7
hours-- you go to the 5 hours

00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:24.950
contact and 7 hours--

00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:27.900
you will not just pass this
class, you will flourish in

00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:29.970
this class.

00:30:29.970 --> 00:30:31.350
How do I know this?

00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:35.610
Because I used to chair the
committee on admissions and

00:30:35.610 --> 00:30:36.860
I've read applications.

00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:40.180
I know the quality of individual
in this room.

00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:42.930
You should have seen, there were
11,000 applications piled

00:30:42.930 --> 00:30:44.930
up like this, each dossier like
this, and they just get

00:30:44.930 --> 00:30:47.290
copied down on a four-by-six
card.

00:30:47.290 --> 00:30:50.650
We get here on a Presidents' Day
weekend and we got stacks

00:30:50.650 --> 00:30:51.570
and stacks of the cards.

00:30:51.570 --> 00:30:54.210
We're looking at your whole
academic life is on a

00:30:54.210 --> 00:30:55.290
four-by-six card.

00:30:55.290 --> 00:30:57.480
And I pick that up
and I go, yes.

00:31:00.890 --> 00:31:02.700
Literally at this speed.

00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:04.750
About 45 seconds.

00:31:04.750 --> 00:31:06.074
No.

00:31:06.074 --> 00:31:08.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:09.212
PROFESSOR: Hell no!

00:31:09.212 --> 00:31:09.700
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:13.680
PROFESSOR: That's how I spent
Presidents' Day weekend.

00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:20.730
And so you got through a very
grueling selection process.

00:31:20.730 --> 00:31:23.220
What's the corollary of that?

00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:25.910
Listen carefully to this:
Everybody in this room has the

00:31:25.910 --> 00:31:28.980
intellectual apparatus
to pass 3.091.

00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:32.430
The only people who fail
3.091 are people who

00:31:32.430 --> 00:31:34.650
choose to fail 3.091.

00:31:34.650 --> 00:31:37.430
They choose not to come to
class, they chose not to go to

00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:40.930
recitation, they chose not
to work the homework.

00:31:40.930 --> 00:31:42.830
I don't know why they
make those choices.

00:31:42.830 --> 00:31:45.740
But I guarantee you if you give
me this amount of time,

00:31:45.740 --> 00:31:46.450
you'll do well.

00:31:46.450 --> 00:31:47.690
It's straightforward.

00:31:47.690 --> 00:31:52.110
Number one problem you are going
to face this fall is not

00:31:52.110 --> 00:31:54.400
secondary bonding, it's
time management.

00:31:57.980 --> 00:32:04.620
So I used to call this
strategies for--

00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:06.810
what did I used to call it?

00:32:06.810 --> 00:32:07.706
I forgot.

00:32:07.706 --> 00:32:11.130
I used to have it something
like, survival strategies.

00:32:11.130 --> 00:32:12.310
But I don't want
you to survive,

00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:13.480
I want you to flourish.

00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:15.470
So I call it recipe
for success.

00:32:15.470 --> 00:32:17.770
There are different venues
for learning.

00:32:17.770 --> 00:32:19.050
OK?

00:32:19.050 --> 00:32:20.850
So lecture, that's here.

00:32:20.850 --> 00:32:22.890
That's my responsibility.

00:32:22.890 --> 00:32:25.400
Recitation, that's Tuesdays
and Thursdays.

00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:27.140
That's my staff.

00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:28.500
Now reading, that's you.

00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:30.380
Homework, that'd be you.

00:32:30.380 --> 00:32:32.590
Weekly quizzes is you,
monthly tests is you,

00:32:32.590 --> 00:32:34.113
final exam is you.

00:32:34.113 --> 00:32:34.860
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:38.280
PROFESSOR: What we have
here is a partnership.

00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:39.181
See?

00:32:39.181 --> 00:32:41.830
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:41.830 --> 00:32:44.220
PROFESSOR: So I'll do my
part, you do your part.

00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:47.880
You know, one of the things
beyond the basic learning of

00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:50.750
the chemistry that we're going
to attempt here is a

00:32:50.750 --> 00:32:51.490
transition.

00:32:51.490 --> 00:32:54.890
You are going to change in
ways you can't imagine.

00:32:54.890 --> 00:32:58.120
I want you to think about the
way you are right now, and I'm

00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:00.580
going to ask you to think
about how you feel about

00:33:00.580 --> 00:33:02.510
yourself on the last
day of class.

00:33:02.510 --> 00:33:04.860
You will be amazed, and it's
not because you know a few

00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:06.500
more chemical equations.

00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:09.120
And what one of the things that
I want to see happen and

00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:13.150
to help facilitate is the
transition from student, which

00:33:13.150 --> 00:33:17.020
you are as a high school
graduate, to scholar.

00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:19.750
And the difference between a
student and a scholar is a

00:33:19.750 --> 00:33:24.100
scholar takes ownership of
his or her learning.

00:33:24.100 --> 00:33:25.620
So you're going to take
ownership of it.

00:33:25.620 --> 00:33:27.370
You know, is this
going to be on?

00:33:27.370 --> 00:33:29.640
Are we responsible for this?

00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:31.340
Go back to high school.

00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:32.750
Here you're a scholar.

00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:35.700
You say, how can I learn
more about this?

00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:38.800
That's the difference.

00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:41.900
So I think we've
covered enough.

00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:44.730
I think we don't want to just
have the whole day, welcome to

00:33:44.730 --> 00:33:45.910
MIT, welcome to MIT.

00:33:45.910 --> 00:33:48.230
So what we're going to do is
we'll get into the lecture,

00:33:48.230 --> 00:33:51.885
and in the very brief amount of
time we have left I'm going

00:33:51.885 --> 00:33:54.455
to talk about the beginnings
of chemistry.

00:33:54.455 --> 00:33:58.490
We're going to talk about
taxonomy, classification,

00:33:58.490 --> 00:34:00.090
nomenclature.

00:34:00.090 --> 00:34:04.770
And to help introduce this I'm
going to refer to the writings

00:34:04.770 --> 00:34:05.930
of William Shakespeare.

00:34:05.930 --> 00:34:08.430
We're going to integrate
some humanities here.

00:34:08.430 --> 00:34:10.660
We're going to read from
Romeo and Juliet.

00:34:10.660 --> 00:34:13.250
Maybe there are people here
who were admitted on the

00:34:13.250 --> 00:34:15.870
strength of the performance
in Romeo and Juliet.

00:34:15.870 --> 00:34:18.520
Maybe one of you was Romeo,
one of you was Juliet.

00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:20.190
Maybe one of you did
the lighting.

00:34:20.190 --> 00:34:21.850
Maybe one of you did
the set design.

00:34:21.850 --> 00:34:23.910
Maybe one of you took
the tickets.

00:34:23.910 --> 00:34:25.320
Somehow you were involved,
right?

00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:27.200
Because we're all involved.

00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:28.270
So let's take a look.

00:34:28.270 --> 00:34:29.550
Act 2, Scene 2.

00:34:29.550 --> 00:34:33.580
Romeo: "But soft, what light
through yonder window breaks?

00:34:33.580 --> 00:34:35.030
It is the east"--

00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:37.330
that's the east. East Campus
is that way, right?

00:34:37.330 --> 00:34:38.230
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:41.790
PROFESSOR: "It is the east, and
Juliet is the sun." That

00:34:41.790 --> 00:34:43.920
has nothing to do with
nomenclature.

00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:47.350
Maybe photon emission, but--

00:34:47.350 --> 00:34:47.920
that's a joke.

00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:49.970
We'll get to it.

00:34:49.970 --> 00:34:51.910
Now Juliet: "O Romeo, Romeo!

00:34:51.910 --> 00:34:53.720
Wherefore art thou Romeo?

00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:56.720
Deny thy father and
refuse thy name.

00:34:56.720 --> 00:35:00.540
Or, if thou wilt not, be but
sworn my love, and I'll no

00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:02.420
longer be a Capulet."
See she's a

00:35:02.420 --> 00:35:04.470
Capulet, he's a Montague.

00:35:04.470 --> 00:35:06.370
You know, the Hatfields
and the McCoys.

00:35:06.370 --> 00:35:07.090
And this is a metaphor.

00:35:07.090 --> 00:35:08.230
It's as old as literature.

00:35:08.230 --> 00:35:12.870
It's about warring factions,
two communities that can't

00:35:12.870 --> 00:35:14.890
stand each other based
on prejudice.

00:35:14.890 --> 00:35:17.940
And then these two youngsters
fall in love, and how love

00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:20.080
triumphs over hatred,
and so on.

00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:23.900
It's powerful stuff and
it's written here.

00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:27.460
Romeo: "Shall I hear more, or
shall I speak at this?"

00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:29.240
Remember, she's up high, he's
doing "Shall I hear more,

00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:31.110
shall I speak at this?" Fellows,
the answer to that

00:35:31.110 --> 00:35:34.570
question is don't speak.

00:35:34.570 --> 00:35:36.680
Don't interrupt her.

00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:36.920
All right.

00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:41.210
So now she goes, "'Tis but thy
name that is my enemy.

00:35:41.210 --> 00:35:44.100
Thou art thyself, though
not a Montague.

00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:45.900
What's Montague?

00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:48.490
It is nor hand, nor foot, nor
arm, nor face, nor any other

00:35:48.490 --> 00:35:49.900
part belonging to a man.

00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:51.870
O, be some other name!

00:35:51.870 --> 00:35:54.040
What's in a name?

00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:57.440
That which we call a rose by any
other word would smell as

00:35:57.440 --> 00:36:00.620
sweet." That's properties,
right?

00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:05.060
"So Romeo would, were he not
Romeo called, retain that dear

00:36:05.060 --> 00:36:08.390
perfection which he owes
without that title.

00:36:08.390 --> 00:36:12.650
Romeo, doff thy name, and for
that name which is no part of

00:36:12.650 --> 00:36:15.360
thee take all myself."

00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:16.340
Beautiful writing.

00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:19.810
400 years ago and it's
just fantastic.

00:36:19.810 --> 00:36:22.250
Well, that's no good.

00:36:22.250 --> 00:36:24.310
That's not the way it
works in science.

00:36:24.310 --> 00:36:26.150
In science we have to agree--

00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:27.860
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:27.860 --> 00:36:31.150
PROFESSOR: We have to
agree on the name.

00:36:31.150 --> 00:36:34.190
And so this is taken from
Chapter 1 of the text, and

00:36:34.190 --> 00:36:37.520
this is the classification
of matter.

00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:40.760
This is about stuff and the
different forms of stuff.

00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:43.290
Over here we have the simplest
form of stuff,

00:36:43.290 --> 00:36:44.210
which is the element.

00:36:44.210 --> 00:36:46.670
And we're going to start here
in 3.091 and we're going to

00:36:46.670 --> 00:36:49.850
work our way all the way through
this table, starting

00:36:49.850 --> 00:36:53.290
with electronic structure and
how electronic structure

00:36:53.290 --> 00:36:54.540
governs stuff.

00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:01.376
So let's start with
a history lesson.

00:37:01.376 --> 00:37:03.530
We'll start with a
history lesson.

00:37:03.530 --> 00:37:05.540
And the history lesson
goes like this.

00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:07.520
What are the origins
of chemistry?

00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:10.910
The ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs
refer to khemeia,

00:37:10.910 --> 00:37:13.450
which was a chemical process
for embalming the dead.

00:37:13.450 --> 00:37:17.500
You know the Egyptians were very
fixated on the afterlife.

00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:21.310
And the chemists, the chemists
were revered in that society--

00:37:21.310 --> 00:37:22.160
not like here.

00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:24.750
They were revered in that
society because they knew how

00:37:24.750 --> 00:37:26.960
to prepare the body
for the afterlife.

00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:29.580
Embalming is a chemical
process.

00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:31.400
A few years ago I
was in London.

00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:34.150
I toured the British Museum
and came upon this.

00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:36.450
This is 18 inches tall.

00:37:36.450 --> 00:37:37.830
It's the mummified cat.

00:37:37.830 --> 00:37:40.630
It's a fantastic example
of mummification.

00:37:40.630 --> 00:37:42.750
It's a beautiful-- most people
go zooming right past it.

00:37:42.750 --> 00:37:45.090
They're looking at the
big dinosaurs and

00:37:45.090 --> 00:37:46.060
all that other nonsense.

00:37:46.060 --> 00:37:48.700
But this, this is beautiful.

00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:51.120
Mummified cat.

00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:54.100
And then khemeia expanded to
other chemical processes:

00:37:54.100 --> 00:37:58.780
dying of cloth, glassmaking,
and metals extraction.

00:37:58.780 --> 00:38:02.680
The chemist could take dirt
and turn it into metal.

00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:03.930
Sorcery.

00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:08.930
Some things haven't changed.

00:38:08.930 --> 00:38:12.730
I'm in that tradition: producing
metal from dirt.

00:38:15.670 --> 00:38:19.060
And they were always looking for
an overarching theme, to

00:38:19.060 --> 00:38:23.850
unite the heavens with
the simple elements.

00:38:23.850 --> 00:38:27.690
So the seven known,
naked-to-the-eye, astronomical

00:38:27.690 --> 00:38:30.510
bodies were associated
with the seven

00:38:30.510 --> 00:38:32.650
known chemical elements.

00:38:32.650 --> 00:38:35.540
And you could even talk in
this priestly language.

00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:38.240
So if you wanted to make a
bronze, which is an alloy of

00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:40.910
tin and copper, you could say,
well let's have the confluence

00:38:40.910 --> 00:38:43.680
of Jupiter and Venus.

00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:44.300
It's all there.

00:38:44.300 --> 00:38:44.850
Mercury.

00:38:44.850 --> 00:38:45.860
Why do we call it Mercury?

00:38:45.860 --> 00:38:49.160
Mercury's a metal that's liquid
at room temperature.

00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:54.210
It's fast. Because Mercury is
the planet that moves quickest

00:38:54.210 --> 00:38:56.030
around the sun.

00:38:56.030 --> 00:38:58.170
Very nice.

00:38:58.170 --> 00:39:01.250
So this is what we knew
2,400 years ago.

00:39:01.250 --> 00:39:05.410
We had the seven metals,
carbon, and silicon.

00:39:05.410 --> 00:39:11.440
And the beginning of the shift
from practice to theory, or

00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:15.950
from craft to science, is with
the work of Democritus.

00:39:19.740 --> 00:39:24.770
Democritus, who lived
around 400 BCE.

00:39:24.770 --> 00:39:27.010
Democritus, who was Greek.

00:39:27.010 --> 00:39:31.190
He described the physical
world as consisting of a

00:39:31.190 --> 00:39:35.310
combination of void
plus being.

00:39:35.310 --> 00:39:37.200
Void plus being.

00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:38.340
These are lofty words.

00:39:38.340 --> 00:39:39.910
Listen to this.

00:39:39.910 --> 00:39:43.410
Void, being not some
little equation.

00:39:43.410 --> 00:39:45.040
It's big, big ideas.

00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:47.140
And how did he describe void?

00:39:47.140 --> 00:39:50.320
Void is something that we
would recognize, in his

00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:53.670
language, as akin to what we
recognize to be vacuum.

00:39:53.670 --> 00:39:59.820
And being, he said, was
comprised of an infinity of

00:39:59.820 --> 00:40:01.110
atoms.

00:40:01.110 --> 00:40:05.500
He coined the term "atom."
"Atom" comes from the Greek

00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:08.750
tomoi, which is to slice.

00:40:08.750 --> 00:40:11.640
And then if you put "a" in front
of it as in apolitical

00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:15.610
or amoral, cannot be sliced:
indivisible.

00:40:15.610 --> 00:40:19.120
The atom cannot be sliced,
and so to these atoms he

00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:21.110
attributed these properties.

00:40:21.110 --> 00:40:27.180
They're indivisible
and eternal.

00:40:27.180 --> 00:40:31.650
I mean, this takes you all the
way to E equals m c squared.

00:40:31.650 --> 00:40:36.080
From 400 BCE, and that's all
he had to work with.

00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:38.100
This is brilliant.

00:40:38.100 --> 00:40:40.670
Absolutely brilliant.

00:40:40.670 --> 00:40:43.530
But to show you that things
don't always go in a linear

00:40:43.530 --> 00:40:46.110
fashion for the better,
along comes Aristotle.

00:40:49.150 --> 00:40:53.490
Aristotle, another Greek, and he
decided, nah, we don't need

00:40:53.490 --> 00:40:55.330
all this carbon, sulfur,
and so on.

00:40:55.330 --> 00:41:01.460
He said, we will have four
essences that will describe

00:41:01.460 --> 00:41:03.380
the earthly world.

00:41:03.380 --> 00:41:05.010
Four essences.

00:41:05.010 --> 00:41:06.260
And here are the
four essences.

00:41:08.820 --> 00:41:12.120
Earth, water, air, fire.

00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:14.020
So those are the Aristotelian
essences.

00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:16.030
And there's actually a
fifth essence that

00:41:16.030 --> 00:41:17.930
describes the heavens.

00:41:17.930 --> 00:41:19.910
That's why we say something
is quintessential.

00:41:19.910 --> 00:41:22.720
It's heavenly, it's et cetera.

00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:24.420
So these are the
four essences.

00:41:24.420 --> 00:41:24.740
All right?

00:41:24.740 --> 00:41:29.970
And then it gets even worse
because he has compounds, a

00:41:29.970 --> 00:41:33.510
combination, so you can take
fire plus earth and make dry,

00:41:33.510 --> 00:41:37.550
earth plus water make cold, air
plus water make wet, air

00:41:37.550 --> 00:41:38.590
plus fire make hot.

00:41:38.590 --> 00:41:40.616
This is nuts.

00:41:40.616 --> 00:41:41.930
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:41.930 --> 00:41:46.520
PROFESSOR: And it dominated
science for a long, long time.

00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:48.550
Because we know really earth
is an aggregate.

00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:51.520
It's an aggregate of different
minerals which are compounds.

00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:55.110
Water, as you know,
is a compound H2O.

00:41:55.110 --> 00:41:57.570
Fire is the product
of combustion.

00:41:57.570 --> 00:42:00.310
It doesn't even belong
in this set.

00:42:00.310 --> 00:42:01.600
And air is a solution.

00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:05.250
It's a homogeneous mixture of
nitrogen, oxygen, argon,

00:42:05.250 --> 00:42:07.930
rising levels of carbon dioxide,
sulfur dioxide.

00:42:07.930 --> 00:42:09.910
And if you're next to
an aluminum smelter,

00:42:09.910 --> 00:42:11.020
tetrafluoromethane.

00:42:11.020 --> 00:42:13.760
And so on and so forth.

00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:17.210
And finally this thing
was knocked down.

00:42:17.210 --> 00:42:21.000
So we can look at this chart
and go back to this one and

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:23.460
say, now we can make
the connections.

00:42:23.460 --> 00:42:24.090
All right.

00:42:24.090 --> 00:42:28.120
Here's the way the elements
looked at the time of the

00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:29.930
American Revolution.

00:42:29.930 --> 00:42:33.710
The alchemists gave us arsenic,
antimony, and bismuth

00:42:33.710 --> 00:42:36.260
in the 12th, 13th,
14th centuries.

00:42:36.260 --> 00:42:39.430
In 13th century India, there
was zinc isolated.

00:42:39.430 --> 00:42:42.280
There's a tall zinc pillar
still standing there.

00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:43.680
Platinum is an American metal.

00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:45.540
It was unknown to
the Europeans.

00:42:45.540 --> 00:42:50.360
It was discovered when the
Spanish came to the Americas.

00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:53.550
Actually, it's kind of ironic
because plata is silver, so

00:42:53.550 --> 00:42:55.930
platina is sort of like a
diminutive of silver, which in

00:42:55.930 --> 00:42:59.700
point of fact is backwards
because silver melts at 962

00:42:59.700 --> 00:43:02.840
degrees Celsius, platinum
melts at 1768.

00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:04.680
It is nobler than silver.

00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:06.820
It has catalytic properties.

00:43:06.820 --> 00:43:10.700
It is even fashionable in
jewelry now if you know how to

00:43:10.700 --> 00:43:13.940
work with it, because gold melts
at 1063 and platinum

00:43:13.940 --> 00:43:15.540
melts at 1762.

00:43:15.540 --> 00:43:17.510
A lot of jewelers can't
work with platinum.

00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:18.390
It's too high-melting.

00:43:18.390 --> 00:43:20.210
It's a fantastic metal.

00:43:20.210 --> 00:43:21.778
It's an American metal.

00:43:21.778 --> 00:43:23.770
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:23.770 --> 00:43:24.610
PROFESSOR: It really is.

00:43:24.610 --> 00:43:25.830
I mean it's an American metal.

00:43:25.830 --> 00:43:27.250
I didn't make this up.

00:43:27.250 --> 00:43:28.810
It's true.

00:43:28.810 --> 00:43:30.890
And then we see these
other elements.

00:43:30.890 --> 00:43:32.790
Discovered, discovered,
discovered, discovered.

00:43:32.790 --> 00:43:34.690
Now we see modern science.

00:43:34.690 --> 00:43:37.390
So what does it mean,
discovered 1766?

00:43:37.390 --> 00:43:39.750
There was no hydrogen
before 1766?

00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:40.980
They found it?

00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:41.250
No.

00:43:41.250 --> 00:43:45.760
It means that Cavendish isolated
it and documented its

00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:47.140
properties.

00:43:47.140 --> 00:43:48.390
Hence, it was discovered.

00:43:52.980 --> 00:43:54.240
Now I've been cheating here.

00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:57.190
This is actually lined up in
a way that we already know,

00:43:57.190 --> 00:44:01.420
where the story is going to
end with this, with the

00:44:01.420 --> 00:44:02.330
Periodic Table.

00:44:02.330 --> 00:44:05.870
I'm just lying them on the table
in a way that makes it

00:44:05.870 --> 00:44:07.140
possible to anticipate.

00:44:07.140 --> 00:44:11.560
But this was the first table of
elements that is of record,

00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:15.720
and this was by John Dalton, the
English chemist, who put

00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:18.220
these in order of atomic mass.

00:44:18.220 --> 00:44:20.960
They're organized in ascending
order of atomic mass.

00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:24.870
And he also started a system
of chemical symbols.

00:44:24.870 --> 00:44:28.560
And you can see that iron has
an "I" with a circle around

00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:30.400
it, and zinc has a "Z" with
a circle around it.

00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:32.970
And the Swedish chemist
Berzelius said, you know I

00:44:32.970 --> 00:44:35.950
don't think the French are going
to like to use "I" with

00:44:35.950 --> 00:44:38.240
a circle around it for iron,
or Germans aren't

00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:38.820
going to like that.

00:44:38.820 --> 00:44:42.380
We better choose something
a little bit neutral.

00:44:42.380 --> 00:44:43.530
So they chose Latin.

00:44:43.530 --> 00:44:46.620
And that's why iron is "Fe" for
ferrum, and gold is "Au"

00:44:46.620 --> 00:44:47.960
for arum, and so on.

00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:49.470
But this was the
first attempt.

00:44:49.470 --> 00:44:51.220
John Dalton actually
was a polymath.

00:44:51.220 --> 00:44:55.980
He was also working on vision,
human vision, and he suffered

00:44:55.980 --> 00:45:01.250
from an affliction that is
present in about 10% of men,

00:45:01.250 --> 00:45:03.010
which is red-green
color blindness.

00:45:03.010 --> 00:45:05.510
And he did the original work on
red-green color blindness.

00:45:05.510 --> 00:45:08.490
In fact, in some circles it
is known as Daltonism.

00:45:08.490 --> 00:45:11.540
It's the same man,
John Dalton.

00:45:11.540 --> 00:45:13.280
Other classifications.

00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:16.200
Dobereiner in Jena talked
about triads.

00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:18.900
And if you took the atomic mass
of chlorine, added it to

00:45:18.900 --> 00:45:21.090
the atomic massive of iodine
divided by two, you get

00:45:21.090 --> 00:45:22.580
something that's not
too far off the

00:45:22.580 --> 00:45:25.330
atomic mass of bromine.

00:45:25.330 --> 00:45:28.120
Newlands was a musician and
he talked about octaves.

00:45:28.120 --> 00:45:31.700
So if you start here, if this
is a diatonic scale, so this

00:45:31.700 --> 00:45:35.500
is C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C.

00:45:35.500 --> 00:45:39.290
So potassium lies an octave
away from sodium.

00:45:39.290 --> 00:45:40.360
He was ridiculed.

00:45:40.360 --> 00:45:42.790
They said, have you considered
perhaps putting the elements

00:45:42.790 --> 00:45:44.610
in alphabetical order?

00:45:44.610 --> 00:45:45.340
They were cruel.

00:45:45.340 --> 00:45:48.020
Scientists can be very
cruel to new ideas.

00:45:48.020 --> 00:45:50.690
And, in fact, in your book this
is some of Newlands work,

00:45:50.690 --> 00:45:55.030
and you can see to what extent
it helps understand things.

00:45:55.030 --> 00:45:58.640
But the first proper
organization came in 1869 with

00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:05.500
Mendeleyev, and also 1870 with
Lothar Meyer in Tuebingen, the

00:46:05.500 --> 00:46:07.540
Periodic table as we know it.

00:46:07.540 --> 00:46:09.510
And this is the set of
elements that were

00:46:09.510 --> 00:46:10.920
known at the time.

00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:14.520
And this is a page from the
paper in which Mendeleyev

00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:17.060
published the Periodic Table.

00:46:17.060 --> 00:46:19.730
And here's the smoking
gun right here.

00:46:19.730 --> 00:46:24.380
It's right here where he says,
in this new system, in this

00:46:24.380 --> 00:46:29.690
proposed system, there are very
many missing elements.

00:46:29.690 --> 00:46:31.720
Very many missing elements--

00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:33.450
that was the key.

00:46:33.450 --> 00:46:37.700
Because he knew that even though
arsenic has the atomic

00:46:37.700 --> 00:46:42.490
mass next highest to that of
zinc not to put arsenic under

00:46:42.490 --> 00:46:44.880
aluminum, not to put
it under silicon.

00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:47.210
It had more in common
with phosphorus.

00:46:47.210 --> 00:46:50.940
So he put it under phosphorus,
and so did Meyer.

00:46:50.940 --> 00:46:55.890
But what Mendeleyev did, which
was a first, he said, there

00:46:55.890 --> 00:46:57.430
are missing elements here.

00:46:57.430 --> 00:47:00.930
There is an element that lies
between silicon and tin, and I

00:47:00.930 --> 00:47:03.090
predict what it's
mass will be.

00:47:03.090 --> 00:47:06.950
I predict what it's chemical
formulation will be, how it

00:47:06.950 --> 00:47:08.390
will react with oxygen.

00:47:08.390 --> 00:47:09.750
The predictions.

00:47:09.750 --> 00:47:11.920
And how did he get this?

00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:14.990
Because he used to travel by
train and he would sit in the

00:47:14.990 --> 00:47:18.780
train station on his trunk
playing solitaire.

00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:20.910
And he'd be going down
one suit, and then

00:47:20.910 --> 00:47:22.870
there'd be a gap.

00:47:22.870 --> 00:47:25.800
And he'd go down the other suit
and he could go farther.

00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:28.790
And so the concept of, I know
there should be an eight of

00:47:28.790 --> 00:47:31.750
spades here, but I have
to stop at the nine.

00:47:31.750 --> 00:47:34.710
I've got a seven but there's
something in there--

00:47:34.710 --> 00:47:38.950
triggered his imagination and
led him to have the courage to

00:47:38.950 --> 00:47:42.730
say, there are elements there
and I will predict their

00:47:42.730 --> 00:47:43.600
properties.

00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:47.740
And when they were discovered
how close he was is shocking.

00:47:47.740 --> 00:47:50.100
Absolutely shocking.

00:47:50.100 --> 00:47:51.420
So we'll get to that next day.

00:47:51.420 --> 00:47:55.020
But before you go I want
to leave you with this.

00:47:55.020 --> 00:47:56.910
This is the portrait
of Mendeleyev that

00:47:56.910 --> 00:47:57.710
you typically see.

00:47:57.710 --> 00:48:02.520
This man on in years,
disheveled, sort of mad

00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:03.730
scientist look.

00:48:03.730 --> 00:48:04.550
Don't remember that.

00:48:04.550 --> 00:48:05.330
Look at this.

00:48:05.330 --> 00:48:09.530
This is Mendeleyev, age 35, when
he proposed the Periodic

00:48:09.530 --> 00:48:13.000
Table of the Elements.

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:13.350
OK.

00:48:13.350 --> 00:48:14.110
We'll adjourn.

00:48:14.110 --> 00:48:16.090
We'll see you on Friday.
