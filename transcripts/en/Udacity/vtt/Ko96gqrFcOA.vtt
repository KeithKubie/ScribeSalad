00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.588
It's a little bit tricky, because
the width is defined at 640 pixels.

00:00:04.588 --> 00:00:08.390
But the max-width is set to 100%.

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:12.670
The max-width actually overrides the
width, which means that the owl image

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.920
will be kept contained within its
container, so this one is responsive.

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.190
Looking at the logo,
we see its width is 125 pixels.

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:26.190
This is actually fine, because 125
pixels is pretty much smaller than any

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:30.520
device, so this one will actually
work well and be responsive.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.900
This one is actually a little dangerous.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.820
Even though the width isn't really that
large, the viewport width on some of

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.180
the smaller devices can be as low
as 320 pixels, which means that

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.500
a box with a width of 350 pixels could
cause some horizontal scrolling.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.590
So this one isn't responsive.

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.370
And finally, with the city div,
we see its width is 100%,

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.570
which means it's always relative and
will be responsive.
