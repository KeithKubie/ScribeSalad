You now know when you might want to use version control and

how to use Git to create and modify version repositories on your own computer.

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:10.150
You've learned how to create branches to track new features and

how to merge your changes together.

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:15.530
In this lesson, you'll learn how to share your changes with other people and

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.590
how to bring other people's changes into your own projects.

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.300
