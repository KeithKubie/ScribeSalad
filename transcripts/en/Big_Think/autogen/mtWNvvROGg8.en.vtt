peer network and one of the reasons our
center was started is because you know

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380
center was started is because you know
 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:50.690
center was started is because you know
if you're really trying to figure out

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:50.700
if you're really trying to figure out
 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.050

make a smart decision and you know right
 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:02.360
make a smart decision and you know right
now we talked about the million-dollar

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370
now we talked about the million-dollar
 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:03.650
now we talked about the million-dollar
question that the kinds of

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:03.660
question that the kinds of
 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.300
question that the kinds of
philanthropists we're trying to help are

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310
philanthropists we're trying to help are
 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:08.000
philanthropists we're trying to help are
asking and that is I'm not the kind of

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.010
asking and that is I'm not the kind of
 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:09.380
asking and that is I'm not the kind of
guy who wants the name on the building

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:09.390
guy who wants the name on the building
 

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:12.850
guy who wants the name on the building
this isn't about social philanthropy

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:12.860
this isn't about social philanthropy
 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.200
this isn't about social philanthropy
this is about my trying to figure out

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210
this is about my trying to figure out
 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.990
this is about my trying to figure out
where I can do the most good with the

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000
where I can do the most good with the
 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.550
where I can do the most good with the
dollars I have

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560
 
 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.420
 
the top issue is right now a sense of

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:26.430
the top issue is right now a sense of
 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:28.460
the top issue is right now a sense of
frustration that they're not sure

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:28.470
frustration that they're not sure
 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:29.450
frustration that they're not sure
whether or not they're making a

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460
whether or not they're making a
 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:33.020
whether or not they're making a
difference and so you know what was top

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:33.030
difference and so you know what was top
 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:34.310
difference and so you know what was top
on the minds of the folks that we're

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:34.320
on the minds of the folks that we're
 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:35.960
on the minds of the folks that we're
talking we were talking to when we

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:35.970
talking we were talking to when we
 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:39.710
talking we were talking to when we
started discussing philanthropy was how

can I have more confidence than actually
 

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:45.140
can I have more confidence than actually
making a change and if I'm going to

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:45.150
making a change and if I'm going to
 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:48.560
making a change and if I'm going to
continue doing this I need to know

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:48.570
continue doing this I need to know
 

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:51.590
continue doing this I need to know
better that my dollars are actually

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:51.600
better that my dollars are actually
 

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.470
better that my dollars are actually

studies where people have said have
asked the question what would make you

asked the question what would make you
 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.530
asked the question what would make you
give more and it was better information

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:03.540
give more and it was better information
 

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:05.620
give more and it was better information
on cost and better information on impact

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:05.630
on cost and better information on impact
 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:08.719

I don't even think in the top five or

00:06:08.719 --> 00:06:08.729
I don't even think in the top five or
 

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:14.850
I don't even think in the top five or
ten it was more of a tax benefit

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:14.860
 
 

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:19.879
 
what we do know is that there's a lot of

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:19.889
what we do know is that there's a lot of
 

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:24.899
what we do know is that there's a lot of
there's a lot of talk surrounding a kind

that's where they're starting if there

00:06:44.399 --> 00:06:44.409
that's where they're starting if there
 

00:06:44.409 --> 00:06:47.459
that's where they're starting if there
is this desire to be more than a more

counting the number of dollars you spend
it's about the other side of the

solving the root cause or putting on a
 

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:21.510
solving the root cause or putting on a
band-aid but given what they're trying

00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:21.520
band-aid but given what they're trying
 

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:27.430
band-aid but given what they're trying
to solve are they doing that well

00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:27.440
 
 

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:29.830
 
with philanthropy just like with any

with philanthropy just like with any
 

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:32.800
with philanthropy just like with any
other decision there are three things

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:32.810
other decision there are three things
 

00:08:32.810 --> 00:08:36.640
other decision there are three things
that could happen one you could do good

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:36.650
that could happen one you could do good
 

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:38.380
that could happen one you could do good
you could have the results you intended

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:38.390
you could have the results you intended
 

00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:41.350
you could have the results you intended
to you could throw a lot of resources

00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:41.360
to you could throw a lot of resources
 

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.680
to you could throw a lot of resources
and not make a whit of difference or

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:43.690
and not make a whit of difference or
 

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:46.930
and not make a whit of difference or
three you can actually do harm to the

00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:46.940
three you can actually do harm to the
 

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:48.540
three you can actually do harm to the
communities that you intended to serve

00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:48.550
communities that you intended to serve
 

00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:50.320
communities that you intended to serve
so the notion of high-impact

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:50.330
so the notion of high-impact
 

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:52.750
so the notion of high-impact
philanthropy is can you approach or

00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:52.760
philanthropy is can you approach or
 

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:54.580
