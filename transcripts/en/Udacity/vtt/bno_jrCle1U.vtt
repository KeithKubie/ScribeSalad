00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.410
Now that we understand the high level

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:07.230
goal of GMS, the most important parameter in

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:13.680
the working of GMS system is age managemet because we need to identify what is

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.210
the globally oldest page whenever want to

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.500
do replacements And let's see how that algorithm

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.450
works and how it is managed. So in any distributed system, one of the goals

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:28.520
is to make sure that any management

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.220
work is not bringing down the productivity of

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:33.900
that node. In other words, you want

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.090
to make sure that Management work is distributed

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:42.100
and not concentrated on any one node and you know in the GMS system, since we

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:50.330
are working with an active set of nodes. Overtime, the node that is active,

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:54.330
may become inactive and a node that was inactive

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.760
may become and so on. And so you don't

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.250
want the management of age information to be assigned

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.230
to any given node. But it is something that

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.800
has to shift over time. And that's sort of

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.280
the fundamental tenant of building any distributed system. Is

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.540
to make sure that we distribute the management work

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.680
so that no single node in the distributed system

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.520
is overburdened of that. That's a general principle,

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.530
and we'll see how that principle is followed in

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.070
this particular system. So we break the management.

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.360
Both along the space axis and time axis, into

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.270
what is called epochs, and there are two

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.910
parameters that govern an epoch. One is T, which

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.770
is the maximum duration of an epoch. That

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.740
is, an epoch is in some sense a granularity.

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:47.260
Of management work done by a node. And that management work done by a node

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.850
is either time bound, maximum T duration, or

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.580
space bound, maximum M replacements. So if, in

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.940
the working of the system, if M

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.060
space replacements. Have happened, then that epoch is

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.310
complete, so we go to a new epoch. There'll be a new manager for age management.

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.580
Or if the duration T is complete, then

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.630
again, the epoch is complete, and so we pick

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.460
a new manager to manage the next epoch. And

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.230
we'll see in a minute how we pick the

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:27.090
new manager. And T maybe on the order of a few seconds. And M, which is the

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.330
number of replacements, maybe on the order of thousands

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.870
of replacements. So at the start of each epoch

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.800
what happens is every node is going to send

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.730
the age information to the initiator. That is.

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.840
Every node is going to say, what is the

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.240
age of the pages that is resident at this

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.320
node. All the local pages, all the global

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.790
pages, universe of all the pages that exist

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.330
at this node, what is the age information

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.980
associated with that? And remember that the smaller the

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.650
age, the more relevant the page is. So the

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.580
higher the age, the older the page. So, in

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.070
picking a candidate, we're always going to pick an

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:11.210
old page to replace. So, that's the age information that

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:15.390
each of these node ascending to the initiator. So,

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.440
in one sense. Its set of pages, N2 sends

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.160
its set of pages, and so on. Everybody is

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.430
sending to the manager node that I'm calling the initiator,

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.170
the age information. What the initiator node is going to

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.020
do is two things. It's going to find out what

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:34.560
is the minimum age of all the M pages

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.290
that are going to be replaced. Remember that. Smaller

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.240
the age, the better. So what it is going to

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.690
say is out of all the pages that exist

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.710
in the entire cluster, what are the oldest M

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:50.080
pages that are going to be replaced in the upcoming

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:55.690
epoch, and for those M old pages, out of those M old pages, what is the minimum

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:00.010
age? So any page with less than the minimum

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.060
age are pages that are active and that are

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.920
going to survive this upcoming epoch. Whereas, any page whose

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.020
age is older than that minimum age, is part

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:12.910
of this set of M pages that are going to

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.150
be replaced in the upcoming epoch, and those are

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.459
the replacement candidates. That's minimum age. So

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.670
it computes the minimum age. And it also

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:24.050
computes given the minimum age and given the

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.450
distribution of the age demographics coming from N1,

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:35.330
I know out of these pages coming from N1 what fraction of the pages that belong

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.760
to N1 are going to be replaced in the

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.630
upcoming epoch. And that is the weight parameter

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:47.680
for this particular node. For instance, if it turns out that N1 has 10% of the

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.090
candidate pages that are going to be replaced

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.830
in the next epoch, then its wage is 0.1.

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.429
If N2 is going to account for 30% of

00:04:55.429 --> 00:04:59.160
the replacements 30% of the M replacements in the

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.790
upcoming epoch. Then N2's weight is going to be

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:06.240
W2 and so on. So what this initiative does

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.350
is it computes this min age and it also

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:12.050
computes the weight for each one of the nodes,

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:15.350
and that's what is sent back to each node.

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:18.450
So each node is going to see the min age and

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:22.290
also the weight for all [UNKNOWN]. Each load is

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:25.810
not only receiving its own weight, that is its

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:28.260
own fraction of the [INAUDIBLE] pages that are going

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.490
to be replaced, but it is also getting the fraction

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:34.140
of the pages that are going to be replaced from

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:36.790
each of its peer nodes in the entire cluster. And

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:39.030
we'll see how this information is going to be used

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:41.840
by each one of these nodes. And of course, we

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.590
don't know the future, all that the initiator is doing.

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:48.880
Is that is saying that it is expected replacement. W1

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:53.160
is expected share of replacement that's going to happen in N1.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.520
W2 is expected share of replacement that's going to happen in

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:00.470
N2 and so on. And when the next epoch

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:03.780
starts actually. That can be different, depending on what

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.110
happens in these [INAUDIBLE]. But, that's the best that

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:09.000
we can do is use the past to predict the

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.870
future. That's what the initiates doing. It is using

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:15.370
the past, the age information that it got from all

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:17.950
the notes, in order to predict the future in

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:21.600
terms of where these end replacements are going to happen.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:25.860
What is the minimum age of the pages that are going to be

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:29.410
replaced in the next epoch. So that's what is being done by the initiator.
