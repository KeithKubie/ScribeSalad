what we think it will be in a few years

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959
what we think it will be in a few years
 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:43.900
what we think it will be in a few years
but we think that it's it's very

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910
but we think that it's it's very
 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.270
but we think that it's it's very
attractive to students and it's a very

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280
attractive to students and it's a very
 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.490
attractive to students and it's a very
hands-on way to get them connected to

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500
hands-on way to get them connected to
 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.630
hands-on way to get them connected to
these fields it's pretty amazing

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640
these fields it's pretty amazing
 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.120
these fields it's pretty amazing
I've been involved I've been involved on

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130
I've been involved I've been involved on
 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.069
I've been involved I've been involved on
a lot of projects usually they don't

00:02:59.069 --> 00:02:59.079
a lot of projects usually they don't
 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:01.840
a lot of projects usually they don't
follow through they're not implemented

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850
follow through they're not implemented
 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.660

giant project to have it three years

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280
giant project to have it three years
 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.319
giant project to have it three years
later be something that's actually

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:08.329
later be something that's actually
 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:12.190
later be something that's actually
powerful to think that only three years

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200
powerful to think that only three years
 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.380
powerful to think that only three years
ago we or three years ago today we're

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390
ago we or three years ago today we're
 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.720

you know just in the middle of the

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730
you know just in the middle of the
 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.390

design of this school had no idea what

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400
design of this school had no idea what
 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.530

it would look like even at the end of

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540
it would look like even at the end of
 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.860
it would look like even at the end of
that semester let alone to think that

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870
that semester let alone to think that
 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:24.850
that semester let alone to think that
three years later we could be walking

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860
three years later we could be walking
 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.550
three years later we could be walking
these halls and talking to kids who are

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560
these halls and talking to kids who are
 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.050
these halls and talking to kids who are
actually at this school it's pretty I

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060
actually at this school it's pretty I
 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.070
actually at this school it's pretty I

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080
 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.550
and as a nation we have a responsibility

participate in these fields but they
 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.380
participate in these fields but they
need to be made accessible to them you

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390
need to be made accessible to them you
 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.470
need to be made accessible to them you
know and the message that we shared with

know and the message that we shared with
 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.350
know and the message that we shared with
students was not we need you to come to

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:58.360
students was not we need you to come to
 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:59.700
students was not we need you to come to
this school so that we can be
