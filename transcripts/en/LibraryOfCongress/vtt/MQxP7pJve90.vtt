00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.190
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:11.870
&gt;&gt; We have our next author
coming up to the stage.

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:13.570
And his name is Chris Van Dusen.

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:15.660
He's an author and an illustrator.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.830
And when Chris Van Dusen was a
kid, he drew and drew and drew.

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:27.580
He especially liked to draw things
like aliens, robots, and monsters.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.050
Two of his childhood heroes
were authors and illustrators

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.060
of children's books: Dr.
Seuss and Robert McCloskey.

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.550
Little did Chris know that one day
he, himself, would be an author

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.280
and an illustrator of
many children's books.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.480
You might recognize his artwork

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.190
from the incredibly
popular Mercy Watson series.

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.240
He's here today to talk about
his new book, Hattie and Hudson,

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.580
a story about the unlikely
friendship between a little girl

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:56.350
and one of Mr. Van Dusen's
childhood specialties, a monster.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.010
He will sign copies of his new
book from 11:30 to 12:30 PM

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.780
over there, in that direction.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.510
Please make some noise
for Chris Van Dusen.

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:19.270
[ Applause ]

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:20.570
&gt;&gt; Chris Van Dusen: Hi, guys.

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:21.960
How are you?

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.010
Thanks for coming today.

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:26.900
I am so excited to
be -- oh, thank you.

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.140
That'd be good since I left
mine back at the hotel.

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.930
I'm going to set these -- I guess
I can put those right there.

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:37.340
Well, good morning, everybody.

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:38.640
Thanks for coming out today.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.940
This is great!

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:41.240
I like the bean-bag idea.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.280
It's kind of like a child
mosh-pit-type thing.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.750
Isn't it? I like that a lot.

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:48.520
My name is Chris.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.110
I live in Maine.

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.770
And I'm going to start, actually,
kind of go off script here

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.060
and I would feel bad if I
didn't sort of give a shout-out

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.750 position:56%
to the people in Texas who are going

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.510
through this horrible
time, as you all know.

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:03.830
I mean just seeing
the things on the TV.

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.400
All the amount of rain
those people are having.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.700
It's just unbelievable.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.070
Up in Maine, what we do
is a lot of times we sort

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.810
of convert rain amounts
to snow amounts.

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.100
And it turns out to be
approximately like one inch

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.390
of rain equals a foot of snow.

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.440
So if Harvey had come to Maine and
sort of churned around the Gulf

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.060
of Maine for a week, like it
did off the coast of Texas,

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.710
we would have had about 48
feet of snow in our town.

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.280
And all you would see
is a big pile of snow

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.330
with a church steeple
sticking up because I live

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.430
in a little town on
the coast of Maine.

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.660
But that just seems
so absurd, right?

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.940
And it's because the
amount of rain they got

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.770
down there was just unbelievable.

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.770
So I hope the recovery goes well.

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:50.410
I really feel bad for those people.

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:55.710
Before I left Maine yesterday, I
heard on the news that in Portland,

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:57.260
which is the largest city in Maine,

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.790 position:56%
they put a great big tractor-trailer
truck right in the middle

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.590
of Monument Square, which is
right in the middle of the city,

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.750
and they just opened up the
back, because it was empty,

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.690
and they just encouraged people
to come and just put stuff

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.250
in the tractor trailer
for the people of Texas.

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.950
So I hope by now that that
truck is pretty well filled up.

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.250
All right.

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:16.550
So let's talk about books.

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:17.850
That's why we're here.

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:21.200
Right? So I'm an author/illustrator
of children's picture books.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.500
You guys may know that.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.120
I actually started my career
by being an illustrator.

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.340
Do you -- all you kids
know what an illustrator --

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.080
who can raise their hand and
tell me what an illustrator does?

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.580
What does an illustrator do?

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.430
[Inaudible] That's right:
someone who draws pictures.

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.210
It's really just kind of a
fancy name for someone who gets

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:41.370
to stay home and draw pictures all
day long, because that's what I do.

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.460
I stay home, at home,
and I just draw pictures,

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:47.200
usually in my slippers, and I
just draw pictures all day long.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.620
I get to draw the coolest pictures.

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.240
But I didn't start writing books
until quite a few years later.

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:54.920
So I started out as an illustrator

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.460
and then years later I
started doing the writing.

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:01.820
And I did a lot of illustrations
for all sorts of magazines.

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:03.970
That's what most of my
work was: for magazines.

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.360
And I noticed the type of magazines
I really loved illustrating

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.450
for were kids' magazines,

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.960
because those are the magazines
I could do these crazy,

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.530
outlandish illustrations.

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.890
Kind of cartoony, which
is what I like.

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:18.330
And I just loved illustrating
for the kids' magazines.

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:23.310 position:56%
Well, one day I was in my studio and
I was working on an illustration,

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.470
and this image popped into my head.

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.650
And I don't know why
this popped in my head,

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.670
but it was a very vivid
image that had to come out.

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:36.280
And the picture that I
pictured in my head was of a man

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:40.110
in a little motorboat with his dog

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.200
and they were stuck way
up in the top of a tree.

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.500
And I don't know why that popped
in my head, but I thought,

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.980
"That would be really fun to draw."

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:52.470
And so I grabbed a scrap of paper
and I quickly drew this little man

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:54.460
in his boat on the top of a tree.

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.630
And I set it aside and
I went back to work.

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:58.110
So I'm working away
on my illustration.

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:00.040
I kept looking over
at that illustration,

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.210
that little sketch
I did and I thought,

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.940 position:56%
"I want to know more about that man.

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:09.470
I want to know more about who he
is, how he ended up in the top

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:13.520
of the tree, how he got there,
how is he going to get down?"

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:18.770
And so for the next few hours, the
next few days, the next few weeks,

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:24.480
I thought about that little picture
that I did, and nine years later,

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:28.680
that little sketch evolved into
my first book which was called

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.200
Down to the Sea with Mr. Magee.

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.500
Has anybody ever seen that book?

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.360
Some of you guys have seen that?

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:34.660
Oh, awesome!

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:35.960
I didn't think anybody outside

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.320
of Maine had heard of
that book actually.

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:39.690
But anyway, that was my first book.

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:41.990
When it came out I wasn't sure
I was going to do another book.

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:44.260
I wasn't sure if it
was going to be a dud

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.110
or if people were going
to actually like it.

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:50.030
And so I went back to doing
magazine illustration.

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:52.840
But I guess it did well enough
because the publisher asked me

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:54.820
if I'd like to do another
Mr. Magee book.

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:59.110
And so I wrote a book about
Mr. Magee going camping

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:01.620
and that's called A Camping
Spree with Mr. Magee.

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:03.320
Has anybody seen --
you seen that one?

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.920
Yeah? Okay.

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:09.250
Wow. That -- see I -- that
kind of blows me away.

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:11.940
I just didn't know you guys
would know those books.

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:14.430
Because I'm probably best known,

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:18.810
one of my best-known books is
a book called The Circus Ship.

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:22.060
You guys seen this one?

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:25.570
[Applause] So The Circus Ship
came out in 2009, it was published

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:30.450
by Candlewick Press, and it was
loosely based on a true story.

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:33.660 position:56%
Off the coast of Maine where I live,
and I live about mid-coast Maine,

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:34.960
there were two big islands.

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:37.470
One's called Vinalhaven;
one's called North Haven.

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:44.980 position:56%
And there really was a ship carrying
a circus in 1836 that sank --

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:47.690
Circus Ship, love it --
off the coast of Maine.

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:49.680
Right off the coast
from where I live.

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:54.410
And I read about it in a magazine,
and it really fascinated me

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:57.990
that there was an elephant swimming

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:01.380
around in Penobscot Bay
about 175 years ago.

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:04.040
And that's right --
that's where our harbor

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:06.610
in our town is, right
on Penobscot Bay.

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:09.090
And I thought, "That is so cool."

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:11.440
So I kind of logged it in
the back of my head somewhere

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.200
because I wasn't -- even at that
point I wasn't even writing books.

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:16.680
But eventually it sort
of popped back out

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:18.490
and that became The Circus Ship.

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:23.620
But I have to be honest,
I'm probably best-known

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:28.980 position:56%
for being an illustrator of a series
of books about a little pig --

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:31.540
or not a little pig
actually a pretty big pig --

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:36.890
that causes a lot of havoc in a
neighborhood called Deckawoo Drive.

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:39.690
And those are called
the Mercy Watson books.

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:42.980 position:56%
Anybody seen the Mercy Watson books?

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:47.780
[Cheering] Alright, now, I can only
claim the visual part of this book

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:50.350
because as you guys probably
know, this is written

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:53.120
by the amazing Kate
DiCamillo who's out here.

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:56.750
And I'm basically the warm-up act
for Kate because she comes on next.

00:07:56.750 --> 00:08:00.860
So I'll get you guys
all prepped for Kate.

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:02.230
But yeah, those were great.

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:06.350 position:56%
These were really fun to illustrate.

00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:09.630
And the way these came about
is kind of a funny story.

00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:12.960
The art director at Candlewick
Press, her name is Ann Stott,

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:16.450
that's the art director I work
with, she had my first three books.

00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:20.120
She had the Down to the Sea with
Mr. Magee, she had A Camping Spree

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:23.940
with Mr. Magee and my third book
was a book called If I Built a Car.

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:25.860
So she had all those.

00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:28.370
Thank you, I like a little
shout-out for -- that's great.

00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:32.830
So she had those books and what she
would do, and I didn't know this

00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:37.240 position:56%
until years later, but she would go
to the editorial meetings and that's

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:40.410
where the editors and the art
directors get together and they try

00:08:40.410 --> 00:08:43.220
to figure out what illustrators are
going to illustrate these books.

00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:45.480
So she would come into the
meetings with the Mr. Magees

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:49.250 position:56%
and If I Built a Car and she really
wanted to work with me on a project.

00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:55.200 position:56%
So they'd present some story or some
manuscript and Ann would say "Well,

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.500
how about Chris for this?"

00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:58.460
And they'd say "No,
he's not quite right."

00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:01.430 position:56%
So the next manuscript would come,
she says "How about Chris for this?"

00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:03.260
"No, that's not quite right."

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:06.400
Well, finally, I guess this
went on for weeks, months,

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:09.290
and finally the manuscript
came in from Kate DiCamillo

00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:12.380
and it was called Mercy
Watson to the Rescue.

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:14.430
And Ann tried one more time,

00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:17.190
she said "How about
Chris for these series?"

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:20.220
And I think really she
just kind of wore them out.

00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:23.070
I think she just wanted them -- you
know, they just wanted her to shut

00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:24.370
up about Chris Van Dusen.

00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:27.620
So they said "okay, we'll
give Chris Van Dusen a shot."

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:35.460
And so I got a call from an art
director I had never heard of,

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:38.560
from a publisher I never
worked for, and said "would you

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:41.030
like to illustrate a series
of books by Kate DiCamillo?"

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:47.180 position:56%
And it was kind of like someone just
came to my door riding a unicorn

00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:48.940
with a pot of gold basically.

00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:50.240
Because that's what it felt.

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:51.540
It felt so magical.

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:54.730
And so for the next four years
of my life, and this is what it's

00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:56.030
like being an illustrator.

00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:57.890
You get a call one day
and someone says "Hey,

00:09:57.890 --> 00:09:59.190
how about for the next four years

00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:01.680
of your life you paint
nothing but pig pictures?

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:03.500
Sometimes they're in pink dresses."

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:05.340
And you go, "I'm your man.

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:06.640
Sign me up."

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:07.940
And so that's what I did
for the next four years,

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:10.690
I did pig pictures
for the Mercy Watson.

00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:13.670
By the way, there are about
50 illustrations in each one

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:17.000
of these books and there are six
books in the original series.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.910
So that's about 300 paintings,

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:20.780
that's why it took
me about four years.

00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:25.320 position:56%
So. But the book we're talking about
today, and I haven't even gotten

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:26.620
to it yet, is my latest book.

00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:27.920
It's called Hattie and Hudson.

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:30.330
Has anybody seen this book yet?

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:31.630
Some of you guys have?

00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:32.930
Oh, excellent.

00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:38.040
So this came out in May
and it's a different book

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:41.240
for me for two main reasons.

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:44.980
The first reason is,
it's not a rhyming story.

00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:47.900
All the books I've written up to
this point are rhyming stories.

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:50.680
I mean, the Mercy Watsons
aren't but I didn't write those.

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:55.490
But The Circus Ship and the Mr.
Magee books, the If I Built books,

00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:59.620
King Hugo's Huge Ego, Randy
Riley's Really Big Hit,

00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:01.090
they're all rhyming books.

00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:02.910
If I Built a House.

00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:06.230
And so this is the first
time I've written a book

00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:08.050
in prose instead of verse.

00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:10.160
It's also the first
book I've written

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:13.220
where a girl is the main character.

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:15.060
Right, girls?

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:16.850
[Cheering] Little fist
pump for girls.

00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:21.220
And the reason I did this because
I go around to schools mostly

00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:23.990
up in Maine where I live
and I talk to the kids.

00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:25.290
And a lot of kids were starting

00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:28.280
to give me some flak,
especially little girls.

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:31.240
And I was telling Kate
this story yesterday.

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:37.620
At one school I was at, I probably
shouldn't have done this but I did,

00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:40.720
this little girl raised her hand
after my presentation and she said,

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:43.580
"Are you ever going to write a book
with a girl as a main character?"

00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:46.190
And she kind of caught me off guard
and I didn't quite know what to say

00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:48.980
and I said, "Well, um, hmm, uh,

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:52.240
well, uh, Mercy Watson's a girl."

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:55.750
And the girl looked at me, I mean,
I think she almost put her hands

00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:59.110
on her hips and went
"Mercy Watson's a pig."

00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:01.870 position:56%
And I said, "Oh yeah, you're right."

00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:04.280
And the teacher helped me
out, she kind of stepped in.

00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:06.300
She said, "But technically, you
didn't write those books, right?"

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:07.960
And I said, "Yes, that's right.

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:09.880
I didn't write those books,"
which had kind of saved me.

00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:12.540
So this is the first
book with a girl.

00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:13.840
It didn't start that way.

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:15.440
It actually started
like all my other books.

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:19.000
It started with a boy, and it
started out as a rhyming book.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.750
It was a boy called Henry and
the title was Henry and Hudson

00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:26.170
because I liked the idea sort of
playing with the name Henry Hudson.

00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:28.080
And it was a rhyming story.

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:29.500
But it just wasn't working.

00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:33.660
I tried over and over and over
again to make the story work,

00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:36.270
and it just was going nowhere.

00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:39.200
My editor Joan Powers was
a little lukewarm on it.

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:41.610
My agent Steve Malk, he was
a little lukewarm about it.

00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:42.980
I was a little lukewarm about it.

00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:46.350
And I couldn't figure out
why it wasn't working.

00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:48.960
And finally one morning I
woke up and it was almost

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:51.820
like the book was talking,
the story was talking to me.

00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:55.650
And it said, "I don't want
to be a rhyming story.

00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:57.860
I don't want to be a rhyming story.

00:12:57.860 --> 00:12:59.550
Write me in prose."

00:12:59.550 --> 00:13:02.800
And so I said, "Of course!"

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:08.130
So I sent an email to my editor,
Joan, and I said, "You know,

00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:09.430
I think this story is trying

00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:11.690
to tell me it doesn't
want to be rhyming story."

00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:14.010
And she said, "Why don't
you take a page and write it

00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:16.840
in prose, and send it to me?"

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:18.930
So I did and I sent it
to her later that day

00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:21.050
and she mailed me a note right back

00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:24.660
and she said, "This
is so much better.

00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:27.640
Why don't you just write
the whole story in prose?"

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:30.900 position:56%
So I did. So I wrote the whole story
and I worked really hard at it.

00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:34.800
And I kept it very simple, very
minimal, and I sent it off to her.

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:37.270
And she hated it.

00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:39.080
She absolutely hated it.

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:41.860
I remember I kind of moped
around the house for a few days,

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:45.100
and my wife, you know, was kind
of looking at me like, "Oh, geez.

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:46.400
Here we go."

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:49.020
And my son said, "What's
up with dad?"

00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:52.720
And my wife said, "It's kind like
he just got an F on a paper."

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:57.650
And so I went and what I had
done is I had taken out all sort

00:13:57.650 --> 00:14:00.270
of the details, all the things
that made it really sort of fun.

00:14:00.270 --> 00:14:04.170
And so Joan said, "You got to put
those things back in, you know.

00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:05.820
You can't make it so bare-bones.

00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:09.210 position:56%
You really have to sort of add those
details that give it the flavor."

00:14:09.210 --> 00:14:10.510
So that's what I did.

00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:12.990
So I don't -- do you
mind if I read it?

00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:14.290
Can I read the story?

00:14:14.290 --> 00:14:16.590
It's kind of small.

00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:18.910
[Applause] It's kind of small,

00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:21.070
and you probably won't
see the pictures too well,

00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:24.610
but at least you'll get
an idea of the story.

00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:28.190
And then we'll have some
questions after that.

00:14:28.190 --> 00:14:30.450
"Hattie McFadden loved to explore.

00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:33.300
Every morning after breakfast,
she'd grab her lifejacket,

00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:36.090
wave goodbye to her parents
and paddle out in the canoe

00:14:36.090 --> 00:14:37.920
to see what she could see.

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:42.940
Hattie discovered all kinds
of things out of the lake.

00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:45.750
She watched as a beaver
tugged an alder branch slowly

00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:47.050
through the water.

00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:51.610 position:56%
Above, two bald eagles circled round
and round on wings brought in flat.

00:14:51.610 --> 00:14:53.860
And over the cove,
a family of turtles

00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:58.050
with shiny black shells
basked in the warm summer sun.

00:14:58.050 --> 00:15:01.250
Hattie was so happy
she started singing.

00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:04.130
'When the sun is up and the day
is new and the birds are a-singing

00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:06.910
in the sky, that's when you'll
find me in my little canoe.

00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:08.960
Paddle just a-paddling by.'

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:12.150 position:56%
She had no idea she was being heard.

00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:17.830
Down at the bottom of the
lake in a cave dark and deep,

00:15:17.830 --> 00:15:20.380
there lived a mysterious creature.

00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:22.860
He was enormous but elusive.

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:24.810 position:56%
He never ventured up to the surface.

00:15:24.810 --> 00:15:30.520
He spent his days down below,
all alone and out of sight.

00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:34.250
The monster was used to
hearing motors buzzing

00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:36.540
and propellers churning overhead.

00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:39.000
It was why stayed hidden
in his cave.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.190
But today he heard
something different.

00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:44.990
A song, bouncy and bubbly, came
echoing down through the water.

00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:47.240
'So come with me because
there's room for two.

00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:48.810
We'll be together, you and I.

00:15:48.810 --> 00:15:50.600
Out on the lake in my little canoe.

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:52.590
Paddle just a-paddling by.'

00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:55.260
It was so cheerful and
charming that it drew the beast

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:57.980
out of his lair and
up toward the light.

00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:03.600
He broke through the water, drawn
by the music and there just off

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:08.290
to his right, was a young girl
alone in a canoe, singing.

00:16:10.290 --> 00:16:13.350
Hattie stopped when the
thing rose beside her.

00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:16.720
She stared at the monster
and the monster stared back.

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:18.490
But she didn't feel afraid.

00:16:18.490 --> 00:16:20.070
There was something in his eyes.

00:16:20.070 --> 00:16:23.050
The way he looked at her and
the curious tilt of his head.

00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:25.720
It was almost as if he
wanted to hear more.

00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:28.990
So Hattie softly continued singing.

00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:32.230
'When the sun goes down and the day
is through and the moon is arise

00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:34.950
in the sky, I'll take you
home in my little canoe.

00:16:34.950 --> 00:16:37.330
Paddle just a-paddling by.'

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:40.680
And as she sang the last
note, Hattie was astounded

00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:44.730
when the giant joined in,
harmonizing with a low rumble."

00:16:44.730 --> 00:16:47.030
It sounded like this.

00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:54.290
"Then someone screamed.

00:16:54.290 --> 00:16:55.850
People pointed.

00:16:55.850 --> 00:16:57.150
Some fainted.

00:16:57.150 --> 00:16:59.990
Motors roared as boats
fled in a frenzy.

00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:02.840
Amid all the commotion, the
creature slid beneath the water

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:09.150
and Hattie paddled slowly and
silently back to the dock.

00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:12.660
That night, Hattie tried to sleep
but every time she closed her eyes,

00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:15.710
she pictured the green, friendly
face looking down at her.

00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:17.810
She wondered if she'd
ever see him again.

00:17:17.810 --> 00:17:20.790
She decided she had to find out.

00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:23.520
At the bottom of the lake, the
girl's sweet song played over

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:25.060
and over in the monster's head.

00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:27.350
He wondered if he'd
ever see her again.

00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:31.670
He decided he had to find out.

00:17:31.670 --> 00:17:34.770
Hattie paddled the canoe
quietly through the darkness.

00:17:34.770 --> 00:17:38.780
She stopped, waited and looked
down into the rippling water.

00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:43.020
Suddenly, a massive black
shape emerged from the depths.

00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:45.590
Two glowing eyes grew
brighter and brighter

00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:49.560 position:56%
as the shape drew closer and closer.

00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:55.140
Slowly, the gigantic head
emerged from the water.

00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:57.770
It glistened in the moonlight.

00:17:57.770 --> 00:17:59.650
For a moment or two, the monster

00:17:59.650 --> 00:18:01.950
and the girl simply
stared at each other.

00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:04.960
Then Hattie broke the silence.

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:08.360
'Hi, I'm Hattie,' she said,
'the girl you met this morning.

00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:10.890
I was really hoping
I'd see you again.

00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:13.890
What's your name?'

00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:16.380
The monster cocked his head.

00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:18.950
'You do have a name, don't you?'

00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:22.710
The monster raised his eyebrows
and cocked his head even more.

00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:25.540
'Hmmm. Maybe you don't,'
Hattie said.

00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:28.560
'Well, you kind of remind
me of my uncle's dog Hudson.

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:29.860
Maybe I should call you Hudson.

00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:31.160
Do you like that name?

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:34.300
Hudson?' The monster slowly smiled.

00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:36.190
'Good. I like it, too,' she said.

00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:37.490
'It fits you.

00:18:37.490 --> 00:18:38.790
Hello, Hudson.'

00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:43.050
And just like that, they
became fast friends.

00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:45.960
The little girl and the huge
monster splashed and played

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:47.260
in the silvery moonlight

00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:49.600
until Hattie realized it
was time to head home.

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:52.690 position:56%
As she climbed into the canoe, she
turned around smiling and said 'Hey,

00:18:52.690 --> 00:18:54.660
Hudson, let's meet again
tomorrow night, okay?'

00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:59.420
Hudson nodded eagerly
and smiled back.

00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:03.780
The next afternoon, there was
a meeting at the town hall.

00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:06.840
Everyone was yelling,
suggesting ways to get rid

00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:09.780
of what they called
'the deadly beast.'

00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:12.710
If only they knew him,
Hattie thought.

00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:15.700
She tried to say something,
but she was interrupted.

00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:17.790
She tried again but
no one heard her.

00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:20.130
She tried several times to speak.

00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:21.800
Finally, she gave up.

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:24.210
When the meeting was over,
Hattie walked home with her dad.

00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:27.870
She felt a little sick.

00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:31.290 position:56%
Hattie snuck out again that night to
be with Hudson, but when they met,

00:19:31.290 --> 00:19:33.390
she didn't feel much like playing.

00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:35.950
'The townspeople saw you
yesterday,' she explained.

00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:38.260
'Everyone thinks you're dangerous.

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:40.290
Tomorrow they're coming to
catch you and take you away.

00:19:40.290 --> 00:19:42.740
I don't know where to, but
we can't let this happen.

00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:44.320
We need a plan.'

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:47.750
Hattie was deep in thought when
Hudson abruptly nudged the canoe

00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:50.120
with his nose, nearly
knocking it over.

00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:52.220
'Hey!' barked Hattie.

00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:53.890
Hudson did it again.

00:19:53.890 --> 00:19:55.410
'What the heck?'

00:19:55.410 --> 00:19:57.190
Once again, he bumped
the boat then he looked

00:19:57.190 --> 00:19:59.510
at her and smiled brightly.

00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:00.820
'Wait a second.

00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:04.470
I think I know what
you're doing,' said Hattie.

00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:07.080
Then she added, 'and
this could work.

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:08.430
This could definitely work.

00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:10.620
Hudson, you're a genius!'

00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:15.600 position:56%
At the break of dawn, Hattie paddled
her canoe over to the town landing.

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:17.720
The men were already
gathered, loading their boats

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:19.550
with radars, ropes and netting.

00:20:19.550 --> 00:20:21.710
Hattie started to feel sick again.

00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:23.470
But she had to stay focused.

00:20:23.470 --> 00:20:25.300
She had to stick to the plan.

00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:27.500
She had to save her new friend.

00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:29.940
So she paddled her canoe
away from the shore

00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:31.470
and to the center of the lake.

00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:32.850
Then, she waited.

00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:36.720
Now it was Hudson's turn.

00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:38.140
He swam up to Hattie.

00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:39.820
He carefully bumped the
bottom of the canoe,

00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:44.500
it flipped over easily tossing
Hattie, as planned, into the water.

00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:48.190
Hattie flailed her arms, she
waved, she splashed the water.

00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:51.390
She pretended to be
in serious peril.

00:20:51.390 --> 00:20:53.580
The men on the landing
sprang into action.

00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:54.880
'Hang on!'

00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:56.180
someone hollered.

00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:57.480
'We're on our way!'

00:20:57.480 --> 00:20:59.790
The boats were coming quickly
but Hattie waited and waited

00:20:59.790 --> 00:21:04.070 position:56%
until they were in perfect position,
then she signaled to Hudson."

00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:05.830
And look at what you
have to do on this page.

00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:08.130
You have to go like this.

00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:14.890
You can see, if you look closely,
Hattie is sitting in the top

00:21:14.890 --> 00:21:17.100
of Hudson's head, so that's kind

00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:20.330
of like a fake rescue
that they've planned.

00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:25.510 position:56%
"The people stared in complete
stunned silence as Hudson swam past.

00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:27.680
When he reached the landing,
he gently lowered his head

00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:29.550
so Hattie could slide off.

00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:34.590
Now, it was Hattie's
turn to hold a meeting.

00:21:34.590 --> 00:21:36.830
'This is Hudson,' she said bravely.

00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:38.130
'He's a friend of mine.

00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:40.550
I know you think he's scary
and mean and dangerous,

00:21:40.550 --> 00:21:42.070
but he's actually very friendly.

00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:44.100
He won't hurt you, I promise.

00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:47.600
This lake is his home, and
I think he deserves to stay.

00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:50.570
Once you get to know him
I'm sure you'll agree.'

00:21:50.570 --> 00:21:52.180
Hattie paused.

00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:54.160
Everyone stood still.

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:55.840
Then a young boy slowly walked up

00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:58.410
and patted Hudson gently
on the nose.

00:21:58.410 --> 00:22:00.780
Another child followed,
then another.

00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:04.230
Soon a few adults cautiously
stepped forward.

00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:09.160
Before long, a crowd had
gathered around Hudson.

00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:10.460
It took some convincing

00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:13.230
but eventually everyone welcomed
the idea of having Hudson around.

00:22:13.230 --> 00:22:15.610
He even became something
of an attraction.

00:22:15.610 --> 00:22:18.210
People traveled from far
and wide to spend time

00:22:18.210 --> 00:22:20.470
with the famous friendly monster.

00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:22.830
But when the sun went down and
the visitors left, for Hattie

00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:26.080
and Hudson everything was just as
it had been since the beginning.

00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:30.040
And every night, they met in the
same place, played the same games,

00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:35.510
and splashed and frolicked under
the big, silver summer moon."

00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:40.620
[ Applause ]

00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:42.000
Thank you, that's the story.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.300
I just want to mention
a couple of things

00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:44.630
and then we'll have some questions.

00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:47.630
I just want to mention a
couple things about this book.

00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:51.910
First of all, there is a
message of acceptance here,

00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:53.590
of not judging by appearance.

00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:56.510
But I started this book
way before the election.

00:22:56.510 --> 00:22:57.810
I just want you to know that.

00:22:57.810 --> 00:23:01.720
Because some of the reviews
have come out; they said,

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:05.270
"This message of acceptance is
so timely" and I started this

00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:09.310
like way back in 2013 or something.

00:23:09.310 --> 00:23:12.920
And but there is one
line in this book that,

00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:16.880
thanks to our current
president, is so fitting,

00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:19.820
I almost could've just said
"Muslim man" in the line

00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:21.550
because it's almost
the exact same thing.

00:23:21.550 --> 00:23:24.450
It's a line that says,
"This lake is his home

00:23:24.450 --> 00:23:26.000
and I think he deserves to stay."

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.810
And I think that's a really
powerful line in the book.

00:23:28.810 --> 00:23:30.110
So.

00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:31.920
[ Applause ]

00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:36.820
There is also -- I knew I could
say this because I think a lot

00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:38.930
of you guys feel the same
way about this whole thing --

00:23:38.930 --> 00:23:42.320
so anyway, there's also a
line in this book that --

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:45.170
I've worked with Kate DiCamillo
for so long that there's a line

00:23:45.170 --> 00:23:47.980
that I swear it sounds like
something Kate would write,

00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:50.650
and I want to just run it past you.

00:23:50.650 --> 00:23:56.490
It's when Hattie's like pretending
to be in trouble and the line is,

00:23:56.490 --> 00:24:00.230
"She pretended to be
in serious peril."

00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:02.200
And I could've said, "She
pretended to be in trouble"

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:05.950
but for some reason, I just
put "serious peril" in there,

00:24:05.950 --> 00:24:08.090
and after I wrote that I said,

00:24:08.090 --> 00:24:10.210
"That's a line Kate
would write" right there.

00:24:10.210 --> 00:24:12.710
So I think it's just
sort of rubs off a bit.

00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:16.850
But anyway, so that's the new story
and I look like I'm just about out

00:24:16.850 --> 00:24:19.780
of time, but maybe we have
time for a few questions,

00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:22.620
and does anybody have
anything they'd like to ask?

00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:26.310
I don't want to go over on my time.

00:24:26.310 --> 00:24:27.610
Any questions?

00:24:27.610 --> 00:24:29.280
I got one right here in the middle.

00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:34.460
&gt;&gt; How did you get inspired?

00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:35.760
&gt;&gt; Chris Van Dusen: Oh.

00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:37.060
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:24:37.060 --> 00:24:38.360
Wait, hold on.

00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:39.660
I'll get you next, yes.

00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:40.960
Yep?

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:42.810
&gt;&gt; How did you get inspired
to write about a lake monster?

00:24:42.810 --> 00:24:48.360
You could've like written
about a tree monster or --

00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:49.660
&gt;&gt; Chris Van Dusen: Yeah!

00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:51.730
&gt;&gt; Or based it away from the lake.

00:24:51.730 --> 00:24:53.030
&gt;&gt; Chris Van Dusen:
That's a great question.

00:24:53.030 --> 00:24:56.450
The reason I wrote about a lake
monster is I live near a big lake

00:24:56.450 --> 00:24:57.750
in Maine.

00:24:57.750 --> 00:25:00.050
There's a big lake in my town.

00:25:00.050 --> 00:25:02.190
And it's a really deep lake
and I always sort of --

00:25:02.190 --> 00:25:04.470
it's the lake that's sort
of pictured in this book.

00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:08.550
And I've always sort of been
fascinated by lake monsters.

00:25:08.550 --> 00:25:11.340
When I was a kid, the Loch
Ness Monster was really popular

00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:14.360
and people were always finding new
pictures of the Loch Ness Monster.

00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:20.450
And so I've always been
fascinated by lake monsters.

00:25:20.450 --> 00:25:23.650
But originally I thought maybe the
monster would have a personality,

00:25:23.650 --> 00:25:25.660
the monster would talk,
too, and all that.

00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:28.610
But I decided to just abandon that
and just make the monster not talk

00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:32.120
and just become a great friend
to this very brave girl.

00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:36.290
And I think it's such a cool idea
to have like this huge friend.,

00:25:36.290 --> 00:25:37.590
you know, living in the lake

00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:39.120
that you could just
have so much fun with.

00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:40.420
That's a great question.

00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:42.030
We had a question right down here.

00:25:42.030 --> 00:25:43.330
&gt;&gt; I'm so sorry.

00:25:43.330 --> 00:25:45.130
&gt;&gt; Chris Van Dusen: That's okay.

[ Inaudible Audience Question ]

00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:50.880
She said when you create a story,

00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:53.010
did the pictures come first
or the words come first?

00:25:53.010 --> 00:25:56.790
It kind of goes hand in hand when
you're working as an illustrator

00:25:56.790 --> 00:25:59.250
because a lot of times
when I'm writing the story,

00:25:59.250 --> 00:26:01.440
I do little thumbnail
sketches of what I sort

00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:03.510
of picture would be on each spread.

00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:06.910
But I really have to finish up
the story completely before I go

00:26:06.910 --> 00:26:10.750
to the series of tight
sketches and final art, so.

00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:13.690
We have one more question and
I think that's going to be it

00:26:13.690 --> 00:26:15.530
because I'm being told
to wrap it up.

00:26:15.530 --> 00:26:16.990
So, yes.

00:26:16.990 --> 00:26:20.480

did I make the pictures?

00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:23.430
That's a great question.

00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:27.490
All my illustrations in all my
books are actually paintings.

They're painted with a
paint called gouache,

00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:34.270
which some of you artists might
know, but kids always look at me

00:26:34.270 --> 00:26:36.370
and think I'm saying "squash."

00:26:36.370 --> 00:26:38.850
But it's actually gouache,
it's a water-based paint.

00:26:38.850 --> 00:26:42.850
It's like an opaque watercolor and
I usually start with a background

00:26:42.850 --> 00:26:44.150
and work to the foreground.

00:26:44.150 --> 00:26:45.650
Takes me about two weeks

00:26:45.650 --> 00:26:48.780
to do a typical spread
illustration for a book.

00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:53.670
So altogether, a book can take like
seven, eight, nine, ten months.

00:26:53.670 --> 00:26:55.770
The Circus Ship had
a lot of details,

00:26:55.770 --> 00:26:58.960
that took me about 14 months
to paint those pictures.

00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:01.630
I think we have to leave it there
because I don't want to bump

00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:04.510
in on Kate's time and I
know she's here and waiting.

00:27:04.510 --> 00:27:06.190
So thank you guys so much.

00:27:06.190 --> 00:27:07.490
I really enjoyed it.

00:27:07.490 --> 00:27:09.510
Have a great festival!

00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:12.280
[ Applause ]

00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:16.140
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.

00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:18.520
