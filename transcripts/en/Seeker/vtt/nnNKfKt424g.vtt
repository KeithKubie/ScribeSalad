Think restoring sight to the blind is only
a bible story?

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:04.280
Think again...

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:09.030
Hey there science fans!

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.050
Dr. Kiki from This Week in Science here for
DNews.

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:14.780
The brain is a wild and crazy place.

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.519
For years, scientists have thought that there
are periods of time during childhood, called

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:23.470
critical periods, when we have to have certain
kinds of experience in order for our senses

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:25.199
to develop properly.

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.519
For our visual sense, studies suggest that
the critical period for correcting any kind

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.489
of deficiency lasts from birth until about
2 years old.

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:38.219
After 2 years old, visual problems like amblyopia
- or lazy eye - for instance, can still be

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.890
reversed, but the success rate decreases the
older you get.

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.320
And, there seems to be a big difference when
treatments are attempted after around age

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.320
6.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.600
The idea of critical periods in vision was
first tested by David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:58.000
in the 1960’s by sewing kitten’s eyes
shut and measuring brain activity in the visual

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.110
cortex.

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:00.339
Totally gruesome, I know.

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:04.100
Anyway, they found that the neural pathways
connected to the closed eye were withered

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.140
in comparison to the normal eye, and that
they never developed vision in that eye, even

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.930
after the eye was reopened months later.

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:17.340
Because adult cats have fully developed visual
systems, sight could be restored even after

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.100
a year of having an eye sewed shut.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.740
Hubel and Weisel won a Nobel Prize for this
work.

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.130
The concept of critical periods has to do
with the idea that “cells that fire together,

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.189
wire together.”

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.549
If your brain doesn’t get that early experience
of visual stimulation, the neural pathways

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:37.520
for vision won’t have a reason to link up
and create the system for vision.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:43.670
In fact, it’s been shown that the visual
cortex itself begins to respond to other sensory

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.409
input, like sound and touch.

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:52.070
You might have heard of blind people who use
a form of echolocation that involves using

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.469
clicks and echoes to get around, even while
riding a bike.

00:01:56.469 --> 00:02:01.210
Brain imaging shows that the brains of these
people are reorganized so that they “see”

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.340
the landscape based on what they hear.

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.799
So, knowing that the brain reorganizes in
this way, with other senses taking up the

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:13.340
neural real estate for vision, can that process
be reversed or is it really permanent?

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.090
An exciting study published in the Journal
of Neurophysiology this week by a research

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:24.160
team from the Universite de Montreal and the
University of Trento suggests that it can…

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.160
kind of.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:30.080
The team imaged the brain of a 50-year-old
woman both before and after she underwent

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:36.610
surgery to implant an artificial cornea, called
a Boston Keratoprosthesis, in her right eye.

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:42.560
The woman had extremely low levels of vision
her entire life, and compared to people with

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:49.130
normal sight and those who lost their sight
later in life, she had both structural and

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.140
functional reorganization of the visual cortex.

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.010
Before the surgery, the visual area responded
to auditory input.

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:01.849
However, after the surgery, there was a significant
reduction in the auditory response, but it

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:04.200
wasn’t total, even after 7 months.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.140
So, this study and others along these lines
suggest that some of the brain shaping that

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.019
takes place during the critical periods of
development is permanent, but some of it can

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:15.060
be reversed.

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.840
The trick now will be discovering what makes
the difference.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.180
Do you want to help sight restoration research
happen?

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.180
You can!

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.640
By donating to Fight For Sight, an organization
that supports and inspires research in vision

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.879
and related sciences by granting funds to
scientists early in their careers.

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:34.330
What do you think of research like this?

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:35.370
Does it give you hope?
