00:00:02.803 --> 00:00:04.771
IN SANTA CLARITA,
CALIFORNIA,

00:00:04.771 --> 00:00:07.174
AND EVERY DAY,
HE DEALS WITH A PROBLEM

00:00:07.174 --> 00:00:09.276
THAT HAS VEXED
LIQUOR STORE OWNERS FOR YEARS.

00:00:09.276 --> 00:00:11.178 line:0%
 
- WE ALWAYS HAVE TEENAGER

00:00:11.178 --> 00:00:12.813 line:0%
 
TRYING TO COME
AND BUY ALCOHOL.

00:00:12.813 --> 00:00:14.181 line:0%
 
WE ALWAYS REFUSE THE SALE.

00:00:14.181 --> 00:00:15.682
- AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,

00:00:15.682 --> 00:00:18.719
NO BUSINESS SHOULD EVER HAVE TO
TURN AWAY A PAYING CUSTOMER,

00:00:18.719 --> 00:00:21.255
SO I PAID NABIL A VISIT
TO HELP HIM OUT.

00:00:21.255 --> 00:00:22.923
EVERY TIME YOU TURN AWAY
A TEENAGER

00:00:22.923 --> 00:00:25.692
WHO'S TRYING TO BUY ALCOHOL,
YOU'RE LOSING A SALE.

00:00:25.692 --> 00:00:27.227
- YES, BECAUSE THAT'S
WHAT THE LAW IS.

00:00:27.227 --> 00:00:31.031
- MM-HMM. SO, FROM NOW ON,
YOU ALLOW THEM TO PURCHASE IT,

00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:34.635
BUT THEY JUST CAN'T TAKE IT HOME
UNTIL THEY'RE 21.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.875
THE MAIN REASON
TEENAGERS WANT BOOZE

00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:43.911
IS TO LOOK COOL
TO THEIR FRIENDS,

00:00:43.911 --> 00:00:46.280
SO IF NABIL LET MINORS
PURCHASE ALCOHOL,

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.981
BUT THEN HELD IT
IN A STORAGE LOCKER

00:00:47.981 --> 00:00:51.285
UNTIL THEIR 21ST BIRTHDAY,
BOUQUET PLAZA LIQUOR WOULD GAIN

00:00:51.285 --> 00:00:54.121
A TON OF NEW UNDERAGE CUSTOMERS,
WHO COULD THEN

00:00:54.121 --> 00:00:56.890
BRAG TO THEIR FRIENDS
THAT THEY OWN BOOZE.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.161
THE PLAN, INCREASE BUSINESS
BY SELLING ALCOHOL TO MINORS.

00:01:01.161 --> 00:01:03.964
- COULD BE POSSIBLE, BUT
WHEN YOU GET CLOSE TO THAT AGE,

00:01:03.964 --> 00:01:06.066
DEFINITELY, YOU DON'T WANT
A VOUCHER THAT SAYS,

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:07.935
"OH, YES, I OWN
COUPLE BOTTLE OF LIQUOR,"

00:01:07.935 --> 00:01:10.237
BUT WHERE THEY ARE?
SO THEY WANT TO HAVE IT.

00:01:10.237 --> 00:01:12.539
- WELL, NO OFFENSE,
BUT, YOU KNOW, I'M A BIT CLOSER

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:14.741
TO MY TEENAGE YEARS
THAN YOU ARE,

00:01:14.741 --> 00:01:19.613
SO I THINK I KNOW
WHAT YOUTH THESE DAYS WANT.

00:01:19.613 --> 00:01:21.882
- IF THEY GET THE HAPPINESS
OF "YES, I HAVE IT,"

00:01:21.882 --> 00:01:23.083
THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

00:01:23.083 --> 00:01:25.419
- WITH NABIL ON BOARD,
I CREATED SOME TAGS

00:01:25.419 --> 00:01:27.855
THAT WOULD WORK LIKE
A COAT CHECK SYSTEM FOR ALCOHOL.

00:01:27.855 --> 00:01:30.557
SO MINORS COULD RECLAIM
THEIR BOOZE FROM STORAGE

00:01:30.557 --> 00:01:32.092
ONCE THEY TURN 21.

00:01:32.092 --> 00:01:35.095
NEXT, I HAD TO GET
THE WORD OUT TO YOUNG PEOPLE,

00:01:35.095 --> 00:01:36.296
SO I ARRANGED A MEETING

00:01:36.296 --> 00:01:38.198
WITH THE CHAIR
OF A LOCAL YOUTH LITTLE LEAGUE

00:01:38.198 --> 00:01:40.734
IN THE HOPES OF LANDING
A SPONSORSHIP DEAL.

00:01:40.734 --> 00:01:43.670 line:0%
 
- YOU SERIOUSLY ARE TALKING
ABOUT PUTTING A BANNER

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.405 line:0%
 
THAT SAYS,
"WE SELL LIQUOR TO MINORS"?

00:01:45.405 --> 00:01:47.941
- THESE MINORS DON'T
ACTUALLY GET TO TAKE HOME

00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:49.843
THE ALCOHOL
TILL THEY'RE 21.

00:01:49.843 --> 00:01:53.447
- WELL, I DO UNDERSTAND IT,
BUT I'M NOT SURE THAT I AGREE

00:01:53.447 --> 00:01:56.483
WITH TYING THAT
UP TO OUR LITTLE LEAGUE.

00:01:56.483 --> 00:01:58.118
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT I'M SAYING?

00:01:58.118 --> 00:01:59.853
- I DON'T KNOW
IF THIS HELPS IN ANY WAY,

00:01:59.853 --> 00:02:03.457
BUT WE'D ALSO BE WILLING
TO OFFER A FREE BOTTLE OF GIN

00:02:03.457 --> 00:02:05.759
TO EVERY KID IN THE LEAGUE.

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.262
- NO, I'M SORRY.

00:02:08.262 --> 00:02:10.330
- THANK YOU
FOR YOUR TIME, THEN.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:11.431
- WELL, THANK YOU
FOR YOUR OFFER.

00:02:11.431 --> 00:02:13.567
- YEAH.
- I'M SURE IT'LL WORK OUT.

00:02:13.567 --> 00:02:16.170
OH, NO.
- WHAT?

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.072
- WHAT IS THIS FOR?
- THIS--

00:02:19.072 --> 00:02:20.240
- WHAT IS THIS FOR?

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.808
- [muttering]
- OH, NO, NO, NO.

00:02:21.808 --> 00:02:23.210
NO, NO.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, THOUGH.

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:24.511
- ARE YOU--
- LET ME SHOW YOU OUT.

00:02:24.511 --> 00:02:26.647
- NO, NO, ARE YOU SURE?
- YEAH, YEAH. WE'RE DONE.

00:02:26.647 --> 00:02:28.248
- WITH SPONSORSHIP
OFF THE TABLE,

00:02:28.248 --> 00:02:30.584
I NEEDED A DIFFERENT WAY
TO REACH THE YOUTH MARKET,

00:02:30.584 --> 00:02:33.387
SO I HIRED A TEEN ACTOR
TO POSE AS A STUDENT

00:02:33.387 --> 00:02:35.923
TO GET THE WORD SPREADING
AT A LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL.

00:02:35.923 --> 00:02:37.691
SO RIGHT OFF THE BAT,
YOU KNOW, BEFORE YOU TALK

00:02:37.691 --> 00:02:38.959
ABOUT THE LIQUOR STORE
OR ANYTHING,

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:40.861
YOU GOT TO ESTABLISH
A RAPPORT

00:02:40.861 --> 00:02:43.397
SO THE TEENS YOU'RE TALKING TO
THINK YOU'RE COOL.

00:02:43.397 --> 00:02:45.265
- OKAY.
- SO MAYBE TALK ABOUT

00:02:45.265 --> 00:02:47.467
HOW SCHOOL SUCKS, YOU KNOW,
OR A BIT

00:02:47.467 --> 00:02:49.236
ABOUT HOW THE INTERNET'S
AWESOME OR SOMETHING.

00:02:49.236 --> 00:02:50.938
AND THROW IN
SOME SWEAR WORDS TOO.

00:02:50.938 --> 00:02:53.106
SO TRY THAT.

00:02:53.106 --> 00:02:54.341
- HEY, MAN, WHAT'S UP?

00:02:54.341 --> 00:02:57.211
HEY, DUDE, THAT INTERNET
THESE DAYS IS SO DOPE.

00:02:57.211 --> 00:02:58.412
MAN, SCHOOL SUCKS, DUDE.

00:02:58.412 --> 00:03:00.214
YOU CAN JUST GO
ON THE STINKING INTERNET.

00:03:00.214 --> 00:03:02.482
- WITH CONNOR TRAINED,
I GAVE HIM A BACKWARDS HAT

00:03:02.482 --> 00:03:05.052
AND SUNGLASSES
SO HE WOULD LOOK COOLER.

00:03:05.052 --> 00:03:06.386
THEN I SENT HIM
ONTO SCHOOL PROPERTY

00:03:06.386 --> 00:03:08.322
TO BEGIN SPREADING THE WORD.

00:03:08.322 --> 00:03:10.724
- SO HOW ABOUT THAT INTERNET,
MAN? WHAT'S UP?

00:03:10.724 --> 00:03:13.894
OH, THE TEACHER SUCKS, BUT
THE INTERNET RULES, YOU KNOW?

00:03:13.894 --> 00:03:15.662
SO, ANYWAYS,
I GOT THIS COOL TIP.

00:03:15.662 --> 00:03:17.297
THERE'S THIS LIQUOR STORE
DOWN THE BLOCK.

00:03:17.297 --> 00:03:21.101
IT'S CALLED
BOUQUET PLAZA LIQUOR STORE,

00:03:21.101 --> 00:03:24.238
AND IT SELLS ALCOHOL
TO MINORS.

00:03:24.238 --> 00:03:27.641
OKAY, I GOT TO GO
BACK TO SKIPPING CLASS.

00:03:27.641 --> 00:03:29.810
- WITH CONNOR WORKING
THE SCHOOL,

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.578
I HEADED
BACK TO BOUQUET PLAZA,

00:03:31.578 --> 00:03:33.881
READY TO RECEIVE
OUR UNDERAGE CUSTOMERS,

00:03:33.881 --> 00:03:37.417
AND WITHIN MINUTES,
THEY BEGAN TO ARRIVE.

00:03:37.417 --> 00:03:39.086
- DID YOU READ
THE SIGN OUTSIDE?

00:03:39.086 --> 00:03:40.420
THAT'S--DID YOU--
- THAT'S REAL?

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:41.688
- YEAH.
- YEAH, YEAH. YOU CAN

00:03:41.688 --> 00:03:42.890
GO GRAB SOME IF YOU WANT.
- YOU WANT TO GO AHEAD

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:43.891
AND GRAB YOURSELF
SOME ALCOHOL OR SOMETHING?

00:03:43.891 --> 00:03:45.225
- [laughs]

00:03:45.225 --> 00:03:47.194
I MEAN, I GUESS SO.
[laughs]

00:03:47.194 --> 00:03:49.263
- LOOK WHAT YOU GOT, HUH?
- LOOK AT THAT.

00:03:49.263 --> 00:03:51.798
- 40 OUNCE.
- OH, THAT'S HUGE, BUDDY.

00:03:51.798 --> 00:03:53.100
- HIGH LIFE, AWESOME.
- YOU'RE GONNA START HEAVY,

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.134
DON'T YOU?
- YEAH.

00:03:54.134 --> 00:03:55.903
[laughter]

00:03:55.903 --> 00:03:57.604
- SO YOU OWN THIS NOW.
- YEAH, IT'S TIGHT.

00:03:57.604 --> 00:04:00.140
- PRETTY SWEET.
AH, AH, NOT SO CLOSE.

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.709
YOU GET A CLAIM CHECK,
SO YOU'RE ALLOWED TO COME BACK

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:05.112
AND CLAIM IT WHEN YOU'RE 21.

00:04:05.112 --> 00:04:06.446
- YEAH, BUT--
[laughs]

00:04:06.446 --> 00:04:09.049
I WANT IT FOR RIGHT NOW.
I DON'T WANT IT TWO YEARS LATER.

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:11.785
- WITH NO REFUNDS ALLOWED,
THE MINORS HAD NO OTHER OPTION

00:04:11.785 --> 00:04:15.322
BUT TO FILL OUT THE CLAIM CHECK,
ALLOWING THEM TO OWN ALCOHOL

00:04:15.322 --> 00:04:17.391
WITHOUT THE CONSEQUENCES
OF CONSUMING IT.

00:04:17.391 --> 00:04:20.127
- WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS WEAK.
THAT SUCKS.

00:04:20.127 --> 00:04:21.562
- IT'S COOL AND LEGAL.

00:04:21.562 --> 00:04:23.130
BREAKING THE LAW
IS NEVER COOL.

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.566
- SEEMS LIKE A WASTE
OF MONEY TO ME.

00:04:25.566 --> 00:04:27.701
- MY PLAN WAS WORKING,
AND NABIL WAS NOW ABLE

00:04:27.701 --> 00:04:30.337
TO SELL TO A WHOLE NEW TYPE
OF CUSTOMER.

00:04:30.337 --> 00:04:32.739
- WHY DID I EVEN
JUST PAY FOR THIS?

00:04:32.739 --> 00:04:34.374
- BECAUSE YOU'RE ALLOWED
TO OWN THE ALCOHOL.

00:04:34.374 --> 00:04:36.343
- OKAY, WELL, I DON'T WANT
TO OWN THE ALCOHOL.

00:04:36.343 --> 00:04:37.878
I WANT THE ALCOHOL.

00:04:37.878 --> 00:04:39.913
- KNOWING THAT SOME TEENS
WOULDN'T BE SATISFIED

00:04:39.913 --> 00:04:42.649
LEAVING EMPTY-HANDED,
I HAD A CORNER OF NABIL'S STORE

00:04:42.649 --> 00:04:44.918
CONVERTED TO LOOK
LIKE A COOL BASEMENT

00:04:44.918 --> 00:04:47.087
SO MINORS COULD TAKE PHOTOS
WITH THEIR ALCOHOL,

00:04:47.087 --> 00:04:48.555
BEFORE IT GOES INTO STORAGE,

00:04:48.555 --> 00:04:51.792
THAT WOULD HELP THEM
BRAG TO THEIR FRIENDS.

00:04:51.792 --> 00:04:54.661
IT FELT GREAT
TO MAKE YOUNG PEOPLE HAPPY

00:04:54.661 --> 00:04:58.198
WHILE TEACHING THEM
ABOUT RESPONSIBLE DRINKING.

00:04:58.198 --> 00:05:00.100
SO AFTER CLOSING UP
FOR THE NIGHT,

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.302
IT BROKE MY HEART
THAT I HAD TO GIVE NABIL

00:05:02.302 --> 00:05:04.037
SOME TERRIBLE NEWS.

00:05:04.037 --> 00:05:06.039
I LOOKED INTO IT,
AND IT TURNS OUT

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:09.943
THAT WHAT WE WERE DOING
WAS EXTREMELY ILLEGAL,

00:05:09.943 --> 00:05:12.813
AND YOU KNOW,
I GOT TO LOOK OUT FOR MYSELF.

00:05:12.813 --> 00:05:14.181
I'M SORRY.

00:05:15.716 --> 00:05:17.084
- GOOD EVENING, SIR.

00:05:17.084 --> 00:05:18.085
- YES?
- ARE YOU THE OWNER

00:05:18.085 --> 00:05:19.553
OF THIS BUSINESS?
- YES, SIR. HI.

00:05:19.553 --> 00:05:21.722
- I'M AFRAID I'M GONNA HAVE TO
PLACE YOU UNDER ARREST.

00:05:21.722 --> 00:05:23.490
- WHY? WHAT'S GOING ON, SIR?
HOW AM I--

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:25.158
- FOR DOING GOOD BUSINESS!

00:05:25.158 --> 00:05:26.159
[dance music]

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:28.161
[laughs]

00:05:28.161 --> 00:05:29.863
♪

00:05:29.863 --> 00:05:32.199
- YOU'RE NOT IN TROUBLE AT ALL,
I WAS JOKING.

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:34.301
- SO REALLY?
IT DOES WORK OUT?

00:05:34.301 --> 00:05:35.502
- YEAH, IT'S NOT ILLEGAL.

00:05:35.502 --> 00:05:36.904
- OKAY.
- I MEAN, HE'S NOT A REAL COP,

00:05:36.904 --> 00:05:38.405
HE'S A STRIPPER, YEAH.
- THAT'S OKAY.

00:05:38.405 --> 00:05:40.440
BUT TO BRING
A STRIPPER TO A BUSINESSMAN,

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.075
IT'S NOT A REALLY
GOOD IDEA, NO.

00:05:42.075 --> 00:05:43.243
- OH, YOU DON'T LIKE IT?

00:05:43.243 --> 00:05:44.411
[music stops]
- NOT AT ALL. LIKE, OKAY--

00:05:44.411 --> 00:05:45.512
- WELL, IT WAS A JOKE,
YOU KNOW,

00:05:45.512 --> 00:05:47.147
LIKE, YOU THOUGHT HE WAS A COP.
YOU KNOW?

00:05:47.147 --> 00:05:48.649
- THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING,
EVEN IF IT'S GONNA BE A JOKE,

00:05:48.649 --> 00:05:51.785
NATHAN, TO BRING A BUSINESSMAN,
BRING HIM, LIKE, STRIPPER--

00:05:51.785 --> 00:05:55.222
A GUY STRIPPER, IT'S NOT REALLY
GONNA BE THE COOL THING TO HAVE.

00:05:55.222 --> 00:05:57.558
- ALL RIGHT.
