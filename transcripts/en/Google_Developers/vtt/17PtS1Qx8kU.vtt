URS HOLZLE: We've all
heard about Snapchat.

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:08.280
A small team of
engineers that have

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.440
built one of the most
popular applications

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:12.990
on the internet today.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.630
And it's been fun for
us to partner with them.

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.600
And so I'm excited today
to welcome Bob Murphy, CTO,

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.710
and co-founder of
Snapchat to the stage

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.840
so we can hear their
story first hand.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:26.825
Sorry, Bobby.

00:00:26.825 --> 00:00:27.450
Please come up.

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:29.977
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:29.977 --> 00:00:30.810
BOBBY MURPHY: Hello.

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.310
URS HOLZLE: Bobby,
glad meeting you.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.010
All right, so I'm curious
how you actually got

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.760
started with both the idea,
and sort of the infrastructure.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.069
What led you there?

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:45.860
BOBBY MURPHY: Yeah.

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.100
So Evan and I got started
on Snapchat summer of 2011.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.987
Basically, kind of understood
that visual content

00:00:52.987 --> 00:00:55.070
was the most engaging,
interesting form of content

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:56.590
that there was.

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.541
And wanted to create
a way to enable

00:00:59.541 --> 00:01:01.040
that to be a means
of communication,

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.350
rather than a piece of content
around which communication

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.099
actually happened.

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:08.380
So that was sort of the initial
concept behind Snapchat.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.970
We launched on Google
App Engine because I'd

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.070
used App Engine a couple
times for some small projects,

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.030
found it was super easy
to get up and running.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.850
And at the time, obviously,
our biggest priority

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.884
was to get a product
in the hands of users

00:01:22.884 --> 00:01:25.300
in the world-- in the real
world-- as quickly as possible.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:26.310
And so I turned again
to App Engine, something

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.351
I was very familiar with.

00:01:27.351 --> 00:01:30.790
And a platform that very
easily abstracts away

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.900
a lot of the complexities of
building, deploying, and a web

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.602
backend into the real world.

00:01:37.602 --> 00:01:39.060
And I think at the
time, App Engine

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.560
was actually still
in preview, so we

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.579
took a chance on a new platform.

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:44.120
But I was fairly
confident that given

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.480
Google's kind of reputation as
a very strong infrastructure

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.410
company, that anything
we built on App Engine

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.507
would eventually scale
if we needed it to.

00:01:52.507 --> 00:01:53.465
URS HOLZLE: And it did.

00:01:53.465 --> 00:01:54.360
BOBBY MURPHY: Yep.

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.026
URS HOLZLE: Can you
tell us a little bit

00:01:56.026 --> 00:01:58.990
about how the platform
supported your launch of more

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.190
recent features, like
the stories feature

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.549
that you launched just recently?

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:04.840
BOBBY MURPHY: Yeah, absolutely.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.589
It's actually been
very surprising for us,

00:02:06.589 --> 00:02:09.930
and like super fortunate,
to see cloud platform

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:12.225
kind of grow its feature
set almost perfectly in sync

00:02:12.225 --> 00:02:13.350
with our own feature needs.

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.740
It's actually funny looking
at the timeline earlier,

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.810
because we've taken
advantage of almost all

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.960
of those product offerings
almost immediately

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.918
upon them being released
to the general public.

00:02:21.918 --> 00:02:24.270
So around the time that we
were launching stories, which

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.862
was fall of last
year, App Engine

00:02:27.862 --> 00:02:29.320
was great for our
core application,

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:30.550
but we were looking for
something a little bit

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.060
more flexible to support the
stories architecture, which

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.840
currently uses Retis on a
huge cluster of Compute Engine

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:37.340
instances.

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.830
And so we were
looking around, and it

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.570
was exactly when Compute Engine
launched to the general public,

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.427
and so along with outgoing
socket connections

00:02:45.427 --> 00:02:46.510
from App Engine front end.

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.450
So it was actually
perfect timing for us.

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.157
That's worked and scaled
tremendously well.

00:02:51.157 --> 00:02:53.240
URS HOLZLE: So you're
running lots of Retis today?

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.590
BOBBY MURPHY: We are.

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.580
Yeah, we've got, I
think, 256 master nodes,

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.770
and two slaves per each,
and with a twin proxy

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:02.510
cluster in front,
and Google load

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:03.925
balancers in front of that.

00:03:03.925 --> 00:03:04.550
URS HOLZLE: OK.

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:09.100
And so, obviously, that all came
with a huge amount of growth,

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.600
right?

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.385
Not just in the
beginning, but actually,

00:03:11.385 --> 00:03:13.760
it's really an amazing thing,
is that the growth has just

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:14.870
been keeping up.

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.290
So how have we helped you?

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:18.753
I hope we have helped you.

00:03:18.753 --> 00:03:19.503
BOBBY MURPHY: Yep.

00:03:19.503 --> 00:03:22.151
Yeah, you guys have seen
the growth first hand.

00:03:22.151 --> 00:03:22.650
Absolutely.

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.940
So, I mean, the biggest
benefit is just the fact

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.700
that we can focus much less
on maintaining infrastructure,

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.991
and much more on building
new infrastructure to support

00:03:29.991 --> 00:03:33.550
the features and the product
developments that we need.

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:37.440
In fact, actually, Tim, one
of our VPs of engineering,

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.815
just last week told me, one
of his biggest surprises

00:03:39.815 --> 00:03:42.944
at joining Snapchat
was at not having

00:03:42.944 --> 00:03:45.110
to deal with the operational
headache and complexity

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:46.590
that he was expecting,
and you would

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.048
expect from a
company at our growth

00:03:48.048 --> 00:03:49.300
rate and our current scale.

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.930
So, yeah, the biggest
benefit is just the fact

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.300
that we can focus less on
maintaining infrastructure

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:55.800
and much more on
building new stuff.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.550
URS HOLZLE: And so as
far as I understand,

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:00.040
you still don't have an
operations team, really.

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:00.873
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:04:00.873 --> 00:04:02.100
BOBBY MURPHY: No, not really.

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:06.324
We're at about 25 engineers
now, and a little bit

00:04:06.324 --> 00:04:08.740
of operational work here and
there, but for the most part,

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:10.620
everyone's focused on
new feature development.

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:11.328
URS HOLZLE: Cool.

00:04:11.328 --> 00:04:14.400
So if you had a piece
of advice for anyone

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.140
out there who wants to build
the next Snapchat on a Google

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:24.160
Platform-- a cloud platform--
how should they go about it?

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.180
BOBBY MURPHY: I would just
say it's a super easy platform

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.790
to use.

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.248
We got started on
App Engine, which

00:04:29.248 --> 00:04:32.940
is amazingly simple to use, and
has scaled tremendously well.

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.002
I've been absolutely
impressed and very surprised

00:04:35.002 --> 00:04:36.460
that it's scaled
as well as it has.

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.200
I certainly thought, early on,
the kind of traditional notion

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.880
of, you build on
a hosted solution,

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.046
and then you reach a certain
size, at which you have

00:04:44.046 --> 00:04:46.400
to move off, I think is
fading, and Google's kind

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.620
of paving the way there.

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.516
And so, what's great
about App Engine,

00:04:50.516 --> 00:04:51.890
and cloud platform
in general, is

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:55.000
that you get that kind
of up-front ease of use

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.350
with the added comfort of
knowing that whatever you're

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:01.790
building, if it needs to, will
eventually scale ad infinitum.

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:02.540
URS HOLZLE: Great!

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:05.540
Let's go to infinity and beyond.

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:06.880
BOBBY MURPHY: Right.

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:07.180
URS HOLZLE: Thanks, Bobby.

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.780
BOBBY MURPHY: Yep.

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.113
URS HOLZLE: Thank you very much.

00:05:09.113 --> 00:05:14.350
