look at just to give you a few a few
 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.080
look at just to give you a few a few
markers if you look at the number of

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090
markers if you look at the number of
 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.120

fourteen percent something something
 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.400
fourteen percent something something
like that if you look at the number of

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410
like that if you look at the number of
 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.420
like that if you look at the number of
fortune 500 companies that have more

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430
fortune 500 companies that have more
 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.450
fortune 500 companies that have more
than three women on the executive

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460
than three women on the executive
 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.020
than three women on the executive
committee it's I think it's a hundred

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030
committee it's I think it's a hundred
 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.639
committee it's I think it's a hundred
companies have more than three women and

00:00:42.639 --> 00:00:42.649
companies have more than three women and
 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:45.709
companies have more than three women and
so in general if you look at that

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719
so in general if you look at that
 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.830
so in general if you look at that
businesses like investment banking or

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840
businesses like investment banking or

finance women are very much
underrepresented there and if you look

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750
underrepresented there and if you look
 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.939
underrepresented there and if you look
across most business schools and I think

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949
across most business schools and I think
 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.770
across most business schools and I think
the average across all business schools

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780
the average across all business schools
 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.520
the average across all business schools

is under thirty percent women our school
 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.250
is under thirty percent women our school
happens to be unusual and that we have

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260
happens to be unusual and that we have
 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.679
happens to be unusual and that we have
and have for a long time add the largest

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689
and have for a long time add the largest
 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.219
and have for a long time add the largest
percentage of women in in our MBA

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229
percentage of women in in our MBA
 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.020
percentage of women in in our MBA
programs or over forty percent and but

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030
programs or over forty percent and but
 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.050
programs or over forty percent and but
it's certainly true that bit in business

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060
it's certainly true that bit in business
 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.820
it's certainly true that bit in business
as a whole you women are

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830
as a whole you women are
 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.789
as a whole you women are
underrepresented whereas in medicine and

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799
underrepresented whereas in medicine and
 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.219
underrepresented whereas in medicine and
law and other professions there they're

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229
law and other professions there they're
 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.730
law and other professions there they're
increasingly increasingly evident and if

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740
increasingly increasingly evident and if
 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.870
increasingly increasingly evident and if
you look at women if you look at women's

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880
you look at women if you look at women's
 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.950
you look at women if you look at women's
success in school at every level of

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960
success in school at every level of

success in school at every level of
education the average performance of

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360
education the average performance of
 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.090
education the average performance of
women is better than the average

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100
women is better than the average
 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.240
women is better than the average
performance of men but what's also true

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250
performance of men but what's also true
 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.280
performance of men but what's also true
is that the variability of men's

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290
is that the variability of men's
 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.819
is that the variability of men's
performance is greater so I think of

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829
performance is greater so I think of
 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.999
performance is greater so I think of
that as the you know more genius nerds

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009
that as the you know more genius nerds
 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.149
that as the you know more genius nerds

and frat boys as opposed to study
performers of phenomenon but what that

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649
performers of phenomenon but what that
 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.620
performers of phenomenon but what that
means is that by the time you get to

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630
means is that by the time you get to
 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.199
means is that by the time you get to

women who are graduating from

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810
women who are graduating from
 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.300
women who are graduating from
from university colleges and

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310
from university colleges and
 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.390
from university colleges and
universities so women are dominant there

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400
universities so women are dominant there
 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.820
universities so women are dominant there
but not in the world of business so

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830
but not in the world of business so
 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:27.980
but not in the world of business so
there's a big puzzle I believe that some

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990
there's a big puzzle I believe that some
 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.880
there's a big puzzle I believe that some
of it some of it is biology that women

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890
of it some of it is biology that women
 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.570
of it some of it is biology that women
take time out to bear children and that

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580
take time out to bear children and that
 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.350
take time out to bear children and that
that interferes with the with the career

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360
that interferes with the with the career
 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.800
that interferes with the with the career
track I also believe that some of it is

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810
track I also believe that some of it is
 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.270
track I also believe that some of it is
that I believe that some of it

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280
that I believe that some of it
 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.820
that I believe that some of it
represents unexploited opportunity for

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830
represents unexploited opportunity for
 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.260

incredibly talented well-educated part
 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.910
incredibly talented well-educated part
of our population who are going into

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920
of our population who are going into
 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.490
of our population who are going into
other professions but not into business

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500
other professions but not into business
 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.890
other professions but not into business
there's something something wrong this

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900
there's something something wrong this
 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.690
there's something something wrong this
it seems to me that there's money being

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700
it seems to me that there's money being
 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.490
it seems to me that there's money being
left on the table and and it maybe being

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500
left on the table and and it maybe being
 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.860
left on the table and and it maybe being
left there because we don't find the

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870
left there because we don't find the
 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.240

right ways to to assimilate women but

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250
right ways to to assimilate women but
 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.940
right ways to to assimilate women but
i'm also a big believer that you know

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950
i'm also a big believer that you know
 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.440
i'm also a big believer that you know
there are lots of books written about

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450
there are lots of books written about
 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:26.420
there are lots of books written about
how women need to change to be able to

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430
how women need to change to be able to
 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.690
how women need to change to be able to
compete in the world of men and i

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700
compete in the world of men and i
 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.240
compete in the world of men and i
actually think that that that's kind of

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250
actually think that that that's kind of
 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:37.630
actually think that that that's kind of
backwards that really men need to change

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640
backwards that really men need to change
 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.400
backwards that really men need to change
and the world of business needs to

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410
and the world of business needs to
 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.729
and the world of business needs to
change to be more accommodating to women

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739
change to be more accommodating to women
 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:46.100
change to be more accommodating to women
well I think that I think it's probably

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110
well I think that I think it's probably
 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:51.170
well I think that I think it's probably
true that a lot of businesses don't are

not well adapted to the needs of to the
particular needs of women but I also

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820
particular needs of women but I also
 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:00.130
particular needs of women but I also
think it's true that a lot of men don't

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140
think it's true that a lot of men don't
 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.120
think it's true that a lot of men don't
understand how to they don't understand

rather than needing women who behave
 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.009
rather than needing women who behave
more like men I think we need men who

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019
more like men I think we need men who
 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.589
more like men I think we need men who
