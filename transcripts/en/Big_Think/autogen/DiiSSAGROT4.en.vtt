to see how that translates into
 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:27.639
to see how that translates into

published reports and later on they were
 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.209
published reports and later on they were
eventually able to you know gain key

00:00:37.209 --> 00:00:37.219
eventually able to you know gain key

but certainly certainly it contributed
 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.020
but certainly certainly it contributed
then we have other issues where we've

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030
then we have other issues where we've
 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.200
then we have other issues where we've
seen more humanitarian based results

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210
seen more humanitarian based results
 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.999

report because it was on an
 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.750
report because it was on an
english-language source the reporter was

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:37.760
english-language source the reporter was
 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.520
english-language source the reporter was
contacted by an aid organization that

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530
contacted by an aid organization that
 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.260
contacted by an aid organization that
ended up covering all of the medical

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270
ended up covering all of the medical
 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.090
ended up covering all of the medical
medical costs and I didn't even hear

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100
medical costs and I didn't even hear
 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.770
medical costs and I didn't even hear
about this until like a month after it

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780
about this until like a month after it
 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.390
about this until like a month after it
took place and I and I noticed because

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:46.400
took place and I and I noticed because
 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.800
took place and I and I noticed because
the reporter had put the follow-up

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810
the reporter had put the follow-up
 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.140
the reporter had put the follow-up
report on ground report and so the other

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.150
report on ground report and so the other
 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.300
report on ground report and so the other
thing we do is we just we allow people

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310
thing we do is we just we allow people
 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.760
thing we do is we just we allow people
to connect amongst themselves and not

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770
to connect amongst themselves and not
 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.219
to connect amongst themselves and not
just pushing one overall agenda but we

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229
just pushing one overall agenda but we
 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:58.690
just pushing one overall agenda but we
allow all these little connections to

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700
allow all these little connections to
 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.300
allow all these little connections to
happen that in little ways help help to

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310
happen that in little ways help help to
 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.240
happen that in little ways help help to
improve society

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250
 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:07.860
I think the biggest thing that I've

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:07.870
I think the biggest thing that I've
 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:10.200
I think the biggest thing that I've
learned because I was coming at this not

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.210
learned because I was coming at this not
 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:12.060
learned because I was coming at this not
from a media or journalism background I

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.070
from a media or journalism background I
 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.160
from a media or journalism background I
was coming at Ground report from a

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170
was coming at Ground report from a
 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.200

diplomacy and international relations
 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.780
diplomacy and international relations
and a technology background is the

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790
and a technology background is the
 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.990
and a technology background is the
incredible importance of the trusted

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000
incredible importance of the trusted
 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.570
incredible importance of the trusted
human network so we can create these

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580
human network so we can create these
 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.890
human network so we can create these
algorithms that build wonderful looking

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900
algorithms that build wonderful looking
 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.870

virtual newspapers but without the human

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880
virtual newspapers but without the human
 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.720
virtual newspapers but without the human
input it really doesn't work because you

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730
input it really doesn't work because you
 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.120
input it really doesn't work because you
can't get a computer to to put stories

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130
can't get a computer to to put stories
 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:37.949
can't get a computer to to put stories
together at least not yet in a way that

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959
together at least not yet in a way that
 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:39.630
together at least not yet in a way that
that really works and it's also

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640
that really works and it's also
 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.310
that really works and it's also
something that translates to your

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320
something that translates to your
 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.990
something that translates to your
community and I mean not just your

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000
community and I mean not just your
 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.010
community and I mean not just your
audience but you're contributing

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020
audience but you're contributing
 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.530
audience but you're contributing
community so if we just when we add

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540
community so if we just when we add
 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.120
community so if we just when we add
ground report just had this algorithm

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130
ground report just had this algorithm
 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:49.350
ground report just had this algorithm
that was choosing the stories and

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360
that was choosing the stories and
 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.100
that was choosing the stories and

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110
publishing it wasn't really enough once
 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.080

we built this team of volunteer

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090
we built this team of volunteer
 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.180

Wikipedia style editors who could go in

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190
Wikipedia style editors who could go in
 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.340
Wikipedia style editors who could go in
any piece of content the suddenly the

any piece of content the suddenly the
 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.650
any piece of content the suddenly the
platform felt like it was alive and it

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660
platform felt like it was alive and it
 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.570

really translated in the behavior of our

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580
really translated in the behavior of our

contributors who took themselves much

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200
contributors who took themselves much
 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.229
contributors who took themselves much
more seriously they realize this is this

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239
more seriously they realize this is this
 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:08.940
more seriously they realize this is this
is an active thing and there are people

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950
is an active thing and there are people
 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.410
is an active thing and there are people
on the other end who really care about

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420
on the other end who really care about
 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.060
on the other end who really care about
what we're doing so i would actually

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.070
what we're doing so i would actually
 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:14.490
what we're doing so i would actually
take sort of the opposite slant of what

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500
take sort of the opposite slant of what
 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.380
take sort of the opposite slant of what
so many of my peers say and say it's the

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390
so many of my peers say and say it's the
 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.390
so many of my peers say and say it's the
human network is so incredibly important

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400
human network is so incredibly important
 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.030
human network is so incredibly important
that we need to really focus on on that

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040
that we need to really focus on on that
 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.520
that we need to really focus on on that
aspect and also a lot of a lot of the

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530
aspect and also a lot of a lot of the
 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:24.600
aspect and also a lot of a lot of the
things that go along with that like

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610
things that go along with that like
 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.470
things that go along with that like
vetting and fact-checking
