perhaps increase the pay of politicians

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:35.470
perhaps increase the pay of politicians
 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.729
perhaps increase the pay of politicians

over 1.4 million dollars a year in
 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.420
over 1.4 million dollars a year in
compensation but to me what's even more

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:51.430
compensation but to me what's even more
 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.490
compensation but to me what's even more
interesting is that the ministers who

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:53.500
interesting is that the ministers who
 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.200
interesting is that the ministers who
are responsible for education and health

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.210
are responsible for education and health
 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.380

outcomes so how GDP performs where the

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199
outcomes so how GDP performs where the
 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:07.230
outcomes so how GDP performs where the
life expectancy increases where the

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240
life expectancy increases where the
 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.870
life expectancy increases where the
inflation declines I think that that is

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880
inflation declines I think that that is
 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.730
inflation declines I think that that is
a very interesting model for us to

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740
a very interesting model for us to
 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.410
a very interesting model for us to
explore because I think it could impose

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420
explore because I think it could impose
 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.020

around reward for performance which we

00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:18.579
around reward for performance which we
 

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:21.029
around reward for performance which we
already see and it applies to many of us

00:01:21.029 --> 00:01:21.039
already see and it applies to many of us

as we work in the private sector so

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:23.259
as we work in the private sector so
 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:24.510
as we work in the private sector so
certainly worth the kind of

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520
certainly worth the kind of
 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.399
certainly worth the kind of
consideration I think that that could

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:26.409
consideration I think that that could
 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:28.679
consideration I think that that could
actually force politicians to think a

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:28.689
actually force politicians to think a
 

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:31.380
actually force politicians to think a
little bit more long-term another

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390
little bit more long-term another
 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.800

proposal on the politicians side is to

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810
proposal on the politicians side is to
 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.319
proposal on the politicians side is to
basically think about minimum standards

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:37.329
basically think about minimum standards
 

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:40.139
basically think about minimum standards
for politicians and this is an idea that

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:40.149
for politicians and this is an idea that
 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:42.480
for politicians and this is an idea that
really for me stuck out as I thought

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490
really for me stuck out as I thought
 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.630
really for me stuck out as I thought
about how the British Parliament looked

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640
about how the British Parliament looked
 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.139
about how the British Parliament looked
back in the 1950s and 60s in that period

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:49.149
back in the 1950s and 60s in that period
 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:51.510
back in the 1950s and 60s in that period
the average age was higher on average

the average age was higher on average
 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.139
the average age was higher on average
about 60 years old but also the skill

teachers lawyers doctors farmers and so
 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:02.910
teachers lawyers doctors farmers and so
people had had other careers and had a

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920
people had had other careers and had a
 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.649
people had had other careers and had a
better understanding of how the economy

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:04.659
better understanding of how the economy
 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:06.499

professional politicians and I think

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260
professional politicians and I think
 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.319
professional politicians and I think
that that can be quite a disservice in

give you one more example of how or what

we might consider in terms of

we might consider in terms of
 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:39.339
we might consider in terms of
politicians is we might think about

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:39.349
politicians is we might think about
 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:42.039
politicians is we might think about
extending the terms of political office

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:42.049
extending the terms of political office
 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:43.720
extending the terms of political office
this is essentially to get away from

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730
this is essentially to get away from
 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.699
this is essentially to get away from
this idea of having elections every two

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709
this idea of having elections every two
 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:47.369
this idea of having elections every two
years as we do in the United States

00:02:47.369 --> 00:02:47.379
years as we do in the United States
 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:50.440

Mexico is an example of a country where

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450
Mexico is an example of a country where
 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.349
Mexico is an example of a country where
the president is in office only once for

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:53.359
the president is in office only once for
 

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:55.420
the president is in office only once for
six years and so I think you get away

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430
six years and so I think you get away
 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.699
six years and so I think you get away
from this desire for politicians to

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709
from this desire for politicians to
 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:59.920
from this desire for politicians to
constantly court or attempt and try to

constantly court or attempt and try to
 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.099
constantly court or attempt and try to
seduce voters with policies that may be

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:03.109
seduce voters with policies that may be
 

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:05.319
seduce voters with policies that may be
short term appealing but over the long

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:05.329
short term appealing but over the long
 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:06.910
short term appealing but over the long
term are incredibly damaging for the
