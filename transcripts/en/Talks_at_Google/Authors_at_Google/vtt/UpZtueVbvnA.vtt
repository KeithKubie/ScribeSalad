&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Hi, guys, both in the audience--hi--as
well as those on your computers and tuning

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:15.540
in. Today we're gonna be talking about "Social
TV," a new book that just came out as authored

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.359
by Mike Proulx and Stacey Shepatin, who we're
lucky enough to have in our audience. And

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:23.669
just to give you a brief bio on Stacey.

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:28.300
Stacey's a Senior Vice President at Hill Holiday
and leads a national broadcast buying Strategic

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.690
Media Partnership Practice for the agency's
portfolio of clients, including Dunkin' Donuts,

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:37.219
Chili's, T J Maxx, Marshall's, Liberty Mutual,
John Hancock, and Home Goods. She won multiple

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:42.760
awards for her work and creativity, including
the Advertising Age Media Maven Award and

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.550
MediaWeek's Media Plan of the Year.

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:51.100
So, we have Stacey here for about an hour.
And she's gonna start off by taking us through

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:58.350
a presentation of her vision of "Social TV."
And then, we'll have some time afterwards

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.999
for questions. So, please join me in welcoming
Stacey Shepatin.

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:04.999
[applause]

00:01:04.999 --> 00:01:09.850
&gt;&gt;Stacey Shepatin: Thank you. So, I'm just
gonna start off and talk about how the book

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.770
came to be. And I usually start this off with
the question that everybody asks me most.

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.270
The first thing I hear from everyone is, "Did
you always wanna write a book?" And the answer

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.820
is no. [laughs] I'm not a good writer.

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:27.189
I never thought I would ever write something
like this before. But I just wanna talk about

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:30.950
how I got here, right? So, if I never wanted
to write a book, how did I get to this point

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:36.340
where we have a book that just came out? So,
this all started a little over a year ago.

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:42.799
The agency where Mike and I came together
and co-hosted a conference for our clients.

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:46.490
And what we were finding is with all of the
changes and all the new technologies that

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.170
were impacting television, is we were really
challenged with how to educate our clients

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.100
on how these are impacting their marketing
plans. We would go out to our clients and

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.980
present one technology. We'd go out and say,
"We wanna test this."

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.719
But our clients didn't have these technologies.
They didn't have connected TVs in their homes.

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:07.460
They didn't have the apps on their phones.
And so, we put this conference together a

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:13.030
year ago to really create an opportunity for
our clients to experience what was happening

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.090
with television. Erin came and spoke with
us last year on our connected TV panel.

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.319
And we got a great response from our clients.
They were really excited to see what was happening.

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:27.030
And because they were able to experience it,
they were starting to understand why they

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:33.730
needed to take these things so seriously.
So, my background is television. And for the

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.440
past several years, all I keep hearing about
is the death of TV and it drives me insane

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:43.300
because our clients, they do spend a lot of
money in television, but we do a lot of research,

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:49.400
a lot of multi-mix modeling, to justify the
fact that television is a very powerful medium

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.660
in driving sales for our clients.

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:57.300
And so, to hear that television is dead and
not as powerful as it once was, was very frustrating

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:02.580
for me. But it's definitely not the same as
what it was. While people are watching more

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:08.950
TV than ever, it's a different experience
today than it was when we were growing up.

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.330
So, it's not this passive experience.

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:16.430
And it's not even this great, high-definition,
single, big screen experience in your living

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:23.700
room anymore. It's different. It's this converging
media, right? So, you have social media converging

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.400
with television, which is creating new experiences
for viewers with their favorite television

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.580
shows. So, it's much more complicated.

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:35.099
As a television buyer, as somebody's who's
trying to find the right environment to place

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:39.020
our client's messages so that they get through
to consumers and we get them to go in and

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:44.450
buy our products, I can't just look at television
on the television screen anymore. I need to

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:49.300
look at this content that's been created to
run on television, but now is available on

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.580
all these different platforms.

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:56.620
So, all these different things now come into
play. We have tablet. We have mobile. We have

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:04.019
connected TV devices--all of these different
options for our clients to reach their customers.

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:09.970
As you've seen, live TV is alive as ever.
If you look at--. And it's boosted by social

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:14.159
media. So, if you just look at some of the
most recent examples, you have the Super Bowl.

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:17.450
Highest tweets per second, the Super Bowl
peak came at the end of the game--over 12

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:18.940
thousand tweets per second.

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.770
Madonna's performance was second--over ten
thousand. So, you can see that people wanna

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:27.350
talk about what they're watching, particularly
in a live environment. It was the most watched

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:33.660
TV program ever. Same thing with the Grammys.
Adele, coming back from her surgery, singing

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:34.960
for the first time.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.630
Thirteen million mentions. These are pretty
significant numbers. This isn't just a small

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:44.190
group of people who are talking about things.
This is a pretty massive group of people that

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:50.790
we need to pay attention to. And their influence
on other people is pretty important. So, the

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:55.010
way--. One of the things, another word that
drives me crazy, aside from the death of TV,

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:57.190
is that TV is a traditional medium.

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:01.280
People say, "Oh, TV is traditional. Media
planners can handle that. We'll cover that

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:06.140
in a meeting." And it's just not a traditional
medium anymore. It's not that simple. So,

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:10.070
Mike and I look at it differently. We look
at it as a new medium. And as a new medium,

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:14.041
we need to plan it differently than we've
planned it in the past.

00:05:14.041 --> 00:05:18.530
So, they way we talk about it with our clients
is there's three major shifts that we've seen

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:22.790
happening. The first is that we have this
instant feedback loop, right? So, you put

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:29.000
something out there and people have the ability
to respond instantaneously. They, we certainly

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.570
do from a creative standpoint, we do tons
of pre-testing before we put creative on the

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:34.570
air.

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:39.040
We do tons of post-testing to see what's happening
and whether it's resonating with consumers.

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:43.560
But you can also get this instant feedback
as soon as you put the creative on the air,

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.510
which is very different from what we had a
few years ago. So, what I wanna play right

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:53.100
now is a commercial that Hill Holiday produced
for Liberty Mutual. It first aired back in

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:58.800
2006. I'm gonna play it for you and talk about
the response.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.550
[plays video clip]

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:08.810

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:12.560
[car engines]

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:39.750
&gt;&gt;Female Narrator: When it's people who do
the right thing, they call it being responsible.

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:52.080
When it's an insurance company, they call
it Liberty Mutual. Responsibility. What's

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:55.380
your policy? Liberty Mutual.

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:58.510
[end video clip]

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:04.740
&gt;&gt;Stacey Shepatin: So here's a response we
got, a letter to Ted Kelly. He's the CEO of

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:09.340
Liberty Mutual. It says, "Kudos on your recent
television advertisement, which depicts one

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:14.180
act of kindness leading to another. I really
loved it. In this age of TV comedy put-downs,

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:18.110
gratuitous sex and violence, and political
campaign negative advertising, it's refreshing

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:20.880
to see something as uplifting to the spirit.

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:24.820
It makes your company stand above the rest.
While I cannot utilize any Liberty Mutual

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:29.310
products," obviously not the response we wanted,
"at this time, please accept the enclosed

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:33.150
check for use in your marketing budget or
community service programs as a sign of my

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:37.500
gratitude." He sent a 20 dollar check for
Liberty Mutual to use towards their marketing.

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:41.980
Now, this was his way of responding to the
content that we put out there for Liberty

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:46.910
Mutual. It's a handwritten letter sent to
the CEO of the company. This is pre-Twitter,

00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:51.570
before you're able to instantly talk about
what you're feeling, what you want people

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:55.450
to know about what you just saw. We re-ran
the spot in 2009.

00:07:55.450 --> 00:08:01.560
And now, we're able to see instant reaction
to the commercial. Here's a couple of examples.

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:05.260
"I'm in love with the Liberty Mutual commercial
that I just saw. It's beautiful." "Anyone

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:09.520
seen the new Liberty Mutual commercial? I'm
not a fan of insurance companies." No one

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:11.460
is, which is one of our problems.

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:16.660
But they're commercial is fantastic. So, this
kind of instant feedback, whether it be from

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:21.970
a content creation standpoint, on an entertainment
side, or from an advertising or marketing

00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:27.260
side, is really critical for us in terms of
monitoring how our marketing is doing. So,

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.520
we look at a tweet as a social impression,
right?

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:34.700
So, television is measured on impressions.
And we value impressions with CPMs and we

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:40.590
buy on that model. But tweets are social impressions
as well. And the value of those social impressions

00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:47.780
is pretty significant to us. And it's important
that we are understanding the impact that

00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:49.820
these social impressions can have on our brand.

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:53.650
We can't control it. We can't control what
people are saying, but we need to be monitoring

00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:58.620
what they're saying and recognize that these
are also marketing impressions that are impacting

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:05.630
people and our brands. So, I wanna show a
video here. This is how Twitter has become

00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:10.330
so incorporated into television programming
today. And then, talk about how you're gonna

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:14.050
see advertising following in those footsteps.

00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:15.580

00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:35.850
&gt;&gt;Simon Fuller: But now the idea, we're gonna
get rid of five people. I've gotta get rid

00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:37.750

that social media's having on television,

right? It's part of the storyline. It gives
you an opportunity to talk about what you're

00:11:54.660 --> 00:12:01.060
seeing. You can vote via Twitter. You can
get content from Twitter as they do on the

00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:07.050
NBC late night talk shows. It's become a huge
piece of the content of a show.

00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:12.960
And so, what I think you're gonna see is advertisers
following in those footsteps. And so, what

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:17.930
I wanna show you next is an example that I
think is a pretty good way of how an advertiser

00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:23.960
has incorporated Twitter, social media, into
their campaigns successfully. And I think,

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:26.400
this doesn't work for every brand. It's really--.

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:30.960
We're not saying that every brand should have
a hashtag on their creative and brand should

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:35.500
be doing something like this. But here's an
example of Wheat Thins--probably not a high-interest

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:40.310
brand that people are talking about a lot.
But they were pretty successful with this

00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:43.490
campaign. And we'll talk a little bit about
what the results were.

00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:46.130
[plays video clip]

00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:53.840
&gt;&gt;Male #7: This is Chris Macho. He tweeted,
"Had a hunch today would be good, but didn't

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:56.900
think it would be this good. Wheat Thins is
now following me on Twitter."

00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:57.900
[knock, knock, knock]

00:12:57.900 --> 00:12:58.900
Chris.

00:12:58.900 --> 00:12:59.900
&gt;&gt;Chris Macho: Yeah?

00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:00.900
&gt;&gt;Male #7: You remember when you tweeted,
"Had a hunch today would be good, but didn't

00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:01.900
think it would be this good. Wheat Thins is
now following me on Twitter."

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:02.900
[Chris laughs]

00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:03.900
&gt;&gt;Chris Macho: Yeah.

00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:04.900
&gt;&gt;Male #7: We made your day once. And I have
a hunch we're gonna make your day again today.

00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:05.900
We have this for you. It's gonna be driving
around town all day today.

00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:06.900
&gt;&gt;Chris Macho: Look at that.

00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:07.900
&gt;&gt;Male #7: Hey, America. Do the right thing.
Follow Chris Macho.

00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:08.900
[car engine]

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:11.220
Follow Chris Macho on Twitter. He's awesome.

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:12.740
[end video clip]

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:18.200
&gt;&gt;Stacey Shepatin: So, it's great. Chris tweeted
something about Wheat Thins. Wheat Thins started

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:24.900
following him. And Chris Macho, who here is
mentions in red, is Chris. Chris and Wheat

00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:29.430
Thins mentions is prior to this creative running.
Nobody knew who Chris was before, right? Well,

00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:31.960
look at those spikes once they started airing
this commercial.

00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:36.150
Chris became famous. But at the same time,
people started talking about Wheat Thins.

00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:39.930
And they weren't talking about them before.
And most of it was all really positive, so

00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:45.230
this is a way for them to incorporate social
media into getting some good, positive exposure

00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:46.640
for the brand.

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:47.640
[pause]

00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:52.360
So, we look at the backchannel. And it's not
just Twitter. I'm focusing on Twitter just

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:56.630
because a lot of what the television shows
are doing are using Twitter, but all of the

00:13:56.630 --> 00:14:00.780
backchannels are really a heartbeat of what's
going on with TV. It gives you an opportunity

00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:05.040
to see what people are talking about, what's
resonating with them, both positively and

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:06.040
negatively.

00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:11.590
And the Grammy is a really good example. So,
while we do see a lot of correlation with

00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:17.090
high ratings and a lot of Twitter mentions,
that doesn't mean that that correlation exists

00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:23.640
for everything. And when you see a heartfelt,
emotional moment in television, or a show

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:29.890
that requires you to really pay attention
and not be distracted during it, you tend

00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:33.410
to see those Twitter mentions go down, even
though ratings are high.

00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:39.240
So, what we did here is, the blue line is
Twitter mentions. As you can see, some of

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:44.281
those peaks here. That first peak is when
Chris Brown performed. That last peak at the

00:14:44.281 --> 00:14:51.110
end was Adele's win for Album of the Year.
And you can see in most of those cases, and

00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:54.770
also the one in the middle where Adele took
the stage for the first time after her surgery

00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:59.830
and sang, that was the highest rated point
in the show and one of the highest points

00:14:59.830 --> 00:15:01.279
in Twitter mentions.

00:15:01.279 --> 00:15:06.360
But what's also interesting here is when Jennifer
Hudson sang her tribute to Whitney Houston.

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:11.090
It's one of the highest rated points in the
show, but we saw a dip in Twitter mentions

00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:16.230
because it obviously was a moment where people
were really engaged with what was going on

00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:20.270
and they wanted to pay attention to Jennifer
Hudson on stage.

00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:27.770
So, we don't want to be too broad and say
that "OK, if it's a show and everybody's talking

00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:31.290
about it, then that's a successful show,"
because that's not the case. There's certainly

00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:37.740
programs out there where people are not talking
about it during those shows. It also is an

00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:40.800
opportunity to tell you when something's not
going right in a show.

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:44.550
So, this is an example from the Emmy's last
year. I don't know how many of you saw this,

00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:50.029
but the Emmytones were these little interstitial
songs that were being sung throughout. And

00:15:50.029 --> 00:15:56.240
the Twitter mentions were universally negative,
right? So, here's an opportunity for a producer

00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:58.100
to say, "Oh, my God. This is not working."

00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:02.660
This is a live show. They could have pulled
these guys right off the air. So, that instant

00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:09.020
feedback can really guide you and give you
some important feedback and impact the content

00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:16.839
of your programming. The second piece is interactivity.
So, the idea of interacting, both on television

00:16:16.839 --> 00:16:19.730
and on secondary screens, is not new.

00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:25.310
It's been around since--. This is an example
from 1996 with WebTV. But there are just so

00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:30.880
many more options to interact with programming.
So, this is an example of the Super Bowl in

00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:36.970
Mike's living room. This is--. He's got his
TV open, his iPad with IntoNow up there. He's

00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:42.370
got his mobile device. And his computer is
following the Brand Bowl to see which commercials

00:16:42.370 --> 00:16:44.980
are winning and which aren't.

00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:50.480
There's lots of different ways to connect
with programming today. And it's very distracting.

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:54.920
There's no doubt about it. And it's also so
fragmented, right? It would be really easy

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:59.660
if we knew that everybody that wasn't paying
attention in a commercial break on TV was

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:01.560
going to the same place on their phone.

00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:07.230
And then, we'll just reach them there, right?
But there's just so many distractions. But

00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:12.480
it's a really good example of how we experience
TV today. So, we look at TV and think of TV

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:17.120
as more of a cross-channel experience. It's
not just the experience of watching TV on

00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:20.600
the big screen. But there's more ways to experience
the programming.

00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:25.689
So, 40 percent of web owners use their phone
daily while watching TV. So, you assume these

00:17:25.689 --> 00:17:29.160
40 percent of people are just distracted from
our television messages 'cause most likely,

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:33.450
they're turning away during those commercial
breaks, rather than during the programming.

00:17:33.450 --> 00:17:38.200
So, from a marketer's standpoint, if we know
40 percent of our audience is distracted,

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:42.320
we need to figure out a way to market it to
those people so that our message is getting

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:44.110
through to them.

00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:48.559
So is it hurting advertising? Of course it's
hurting advertising without a doubt. So what

00:17:48.559 --> 00:17:53.630
we did at Hill Holiday is we commissioned
a study. And we wanted to see if there was

00:17:53.630 --> 00:18:03.281
a way for us to build back, recall, and preference
for a commercial by doing something in the

00:18:03.281 --> 00:18:07.640
digital environment. So, we went in with the
questions: "Would you recommend it to your

00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:08.640
friends?"

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:12.470
We showed them clips of the movie trailer,
"Friends with Kids." "Would you watch it yourself

00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:17.630
and can you recall key facts from the trailer?"
And so, our methodologies, we had three test

00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:22.850
groups. We had did a simulation of a two-screen
experience. So, one group had only saw the

00:18:22.850 --> 00:18:24.330
commercial on the primary screen.

00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:28.740
They did not have a secondary device in their
hand. The second group saw the commercial

00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:33.680
on the TV screen and had a secondary device,
but saw a different creative when they went

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:38.880
on to their secondary device during the commercial
break. And the third group saw the commercial

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:44.230
on the TV and then saw a synced ad, so the
same creative or creative messaging on their

00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:48.590
secondary device when they were distracted
from the main screen.

00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:54.540
And what we found is, obviously, the group
that didn't have any distraction, that only

00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:58.460
saw the commercial on the primary screen and
was not distracted with a secondary device,

00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:03.200
had the highest recall and the highest preference.
In the second group that was distracted and

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:08.970
saw a different creative, the recall and preference
dropped eight percent and seventeen percent,

00:19:08.970 --> 00:19:10.080
respectively.

00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:16.500
And then, in that third group, where they
saw a synced ad--so, a "Friends with Kids"

00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:20.920
ad on their secondary device while it was
playing on the main screen--that recall and

00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:25.440
preference went back up almost to the levels
of that primary screen group. So, what that

00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:30.110
tell us is we need to find a way to market
to this group that's distracted from the TV

00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:31.110
screen.

00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:35.300
And the challenge with that is, like I said
before, they're not all in the same place.

00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:39.470
Some of them are on their email. Some of them
are doing companion content to what they're

00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:44.170
watching on TV. But they're in a lot of different
places. And so, we're working out to figure

00:19:44.170 --> 00:19:48.560
out what are those places and where do we
need to be and how can we create that messaging

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:51.020
so that our message is getting through.

00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:52.020
[pause]

00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:56.730
So, we're fighting for attention. And we'll
continue to figure out how to get through

00:19:56.730 --> 00:20:02.630
with all these distractions. The third piece
is portability. So, the idea of TV everywhere.

00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:07.690
There's so many different devices you can
get your content--on your main screen, on

00:20:07.690 --> 00:20:12.750
your computer, on your phone, on your tablet
through apps, and all different kinds of sites.

00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:20.530
So, your TV everywhere is something that we
have to contend with as well. This is an example

00:20:20.530 --> 00:20:25.810
of the XFINITY iPad app. It basically acts
as your remote control. You can switch channels

00:20:25.810 --> 00:20:32.040
from it. You can get recommendations from
friends. You can try out new programming.

00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:36.390
It really is a control over your whole television
experience. And it's starting to bring some

00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:38.810
of these capabilities together.

00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:40.110
[pause]

00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:43.550
You can just click on, they'll show you top
picks. So, you're getting it sorted by what

00:20:43.550 --> 00:20:46.780
people are watching, what people think is
great that's out there. So, it gives you a

00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:52.950
chance to sample new programming. So, with
all these things out there, we think it's

00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:57.670
important that TV not be considered a traditional
medium--that it's considered a new medium--and

00:20:57.670 --> 00:21:02.500
that you really need to plan it and market
it differently than we have in the past.

00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:06.730
And so, that's why we wrote the book. [laughs]
We wrote the book as a guide for marketers

00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:11.540
because there were so many questions on how
to navigate this space. And when you look

00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:16.710
at the literal definition of social TV, it's
the convergence of social media with television.

00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:20.920
But social TV has sort of become a catch-all
for all technologies and all things that are

00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:21.920
impacting television.

00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:27.750
And we get into a lot of that in the book.
There's chapters in there on the backchannel,

00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:35.050
on bridge content, on social TV guides, on
addressable TV, all the things that are providing

00:21:35.050 --> 00:21:40.660
new marketing opportunities for our clients.
And so the process of going through writing

00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:46.440
the book, we interviewed 75 people for the
book from over 50 companies.

00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:52.090
And the process here--. So, the challenge
that we were faced with is this space was

00:21:52.090 --> 00:21:58.630
changing so rapidly, is how could we capture
it without it being dated. So, we had to write

00:21:58.630 --> 00:22:02.690
it pretty quickly and get it out quickly.
We wanted to launch it at our TVnext event,

00:22:02.690 --> 00:22:05.510
which we knew was gonna be in February of
2012.

00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:10.830
But I also do all the up-front negotiations
for the agency and couldn't handle taking

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:14.460
this on while I was in the middle of those
up-front negotiations. So, we were limited

00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:19.710
in that we really couldn’t start until the
end of July. So, from July to the end of August,

00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:22.450
we interviewed all of these people for the
book.

00:22:22.450 --> 00:22:28.000
We did all the research. At the end of August,
we started writing. And we had to have the

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.850
manuscript done at the end of October. So,
we had, basically, one chapter a week for

00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:38.370
ten weeks. And what that is, is a 14-page
paper every week. So, now back to "did I ever

00:22:38.370 --> 00:22:44.510
wanna write a book?" Writing a 14-page paper
every week for ten weeks in a row is a huge

00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:47.590
challenge, but a great learning experience.

00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:57.210
And for me, it was really the ability to do
something I never thought I could do. It has

00:22:57.210 --> 00:23:02.540
been a great experience for me. So, the end
of the book. So, there's ten chapters in the

00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:07.860
book. And we held the chapter 11 to write
closer to the book release because we knew

00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:11.810
there would be more to say. And we wanted
to make it as relevant as we could.

00:23:11.810 --> 00:23:16.560
So, Chapter 11 was written in January. It's
only available online. Every chapter ends

00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:21.100
with a QR code. You can scan each chapter
and you can get more information on the case

00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:26.050
studies that we talk about in the book, updates.
So, for example, on chapter seven, which is

00:23:26.050 --> 00:23:31.280
about addressable TV and interactive TV, there's
an update if you scan it about Canoe no longer

00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:33.480
being in the interactive TV business.

00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:37.770
So, we're doing our best to keep it as up-to-date
as possible. But like I said, things are changing

00:23:37.770 --> 00:23:42.950
so rapidly. But in chapter eleven, we talk
about a new planning model. So, one of the

00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:46.660
next questions we get is, "OK. All this stuff
is going on and how is that changing your

00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:48.710
job? What are you doing differently?"

00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:53.731
So, Mike and I worked on this new planning
model. And we call it our "watch model." And

00:23:53.731 --> 00:23:58.890
basically, there's five key things that we
look at. And the first is widening our inputs.

00:23:58.890 --> 00:24:04.809
So, from a TV perspective, we use Neilsen
and MRI/Simmons and have used them for years

00:24:04.809 --> 00:24:09.880
as the source to figure out where is our target
watching and where should we be advertising.

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:13.760
But now there's so many more data points out
there that we need to take into consideration

00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:19.549
as we're looking at what programs we should
buying for our clients. But this isn't easy,

00:24:19.549 --> 00:24:27.130
right? So, it costs a lot of money to buy
into all of these research companies. So,

00:24:27.130 --> 00:24:31.840
it's challenging, but we're doing our best
to evaluate all of the different research

00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:36.960
companies that are out there to make sure
that we are understanding where our targets

00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:39.530
are and where these influential people are.

00:24:39.530 --> 00:24:44.390
Because as I talked about before, we've been
buying in impressions in television for years,

00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:48.380
but social impressions and the impact that
social impressions can have on your brand

00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:52.410
are probably more valuable. They're smaller
in number, but they're very valuable. And

00:24:52.410 --> 00:24:56.559
we need to know who those people are and what
they're saying about us and how we can market

00:24:56.559 --> 00:24:58.760
appropriately to them.

00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:02.100
The second one is being able to adjust in
real-time. So, my examples from a content

00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:06.970
standpoint from television programming is
we're getting this instant feedback. We need

00:25:06.970 --> 00:25:11.280
to make sure that we're flexible enough on
the agency side to be able to react to it.

00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:17.560
So, whether that's changing things creatively
or moving units from certain shows to others,

00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:21.581
we need to make sure that we're structured
in a way that we can react that way. And we're

00:25:21.581 --> 00:25:27.630
working on it. I think that we're set up more
and more and clients understand that they're

00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:29.559
going to get this feedback instantly.

00:25:29.559 --> 00:25:34.140
And they're gonna need to make decisions more
quickly. So, we're working on being able to

00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:39.890
do that as well. The third is teaming up.
And I'm sure you've heard this before, but

00:25:39.890 --> 00:25:44.320
it's pretty important. And that is that all
of the departments need to work more closely

00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:50.240
together. Not just within media. Not just
digital and TV and planning.

00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:56.261
But creative and production need to be part
of the mix as well. And so, we're structured--.

00:25:56.261 --> 00:26:01.881
Hill Holiday is a fully-integrated agency,
so we're structured in a way that this is

00:26:01.881 --> 00:26:05.350
easier 'cause we're all in the same building.
But we also have clients who are media only

00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:09.700
and we need to work with other agencies and
we need to make sure that this happens.

00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:14.610
Because when we find that all of the teams
are working together and the creative is part

00:26:14.610 --> 00:26:18.840
of the media decision from the beginning and
media is involved in creatives being developed,

00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:27.000
that ultimately we have a much stronger program
in the end. Converging media is really about

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:31.600
thinking about television as this cross-channel
experience that in planning television and

00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:34.980
planning television GRPs, we're not just planning
for the TV screen.

00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:38.920
So, as we're looking at it, we're really looking
at all of these other environments as part

00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:46.900
of the TV experience because people are experiencing
TV across platforms, not just on one platform.

00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:51.560
And finally, is content and making sure that
everybody focuses on content first. Because

00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:58.150
no matter what great, cool technology is developed,
if the initial content is not good, then people

00:26:58.150 --> 00:26:59.950
aren't gonna wanna do all these other things
around it.

00:26:59.950 --> 00:27:03.370
They're not gonna wanna play games around
it. They're not gonna wanna talk about it.

00:27:03.370 --> 00:27:07.340
They're not gonna wanna sync up and get cool
information about it. And all that stuff just

00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:11.230
doesn't matter, so we wanna make sure that
the content comes first, both from the programming

00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:17.190
side and even from the agency side, when we're
creating campaigns for our clients. We're

00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:20.660
always thinking about what are the new things
that we could be doing. But ultimately, the

00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:23.980
creative messaging in that has to be right
first.

00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:25.080
[pause]

00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:28.890
So, what have I learned from the book? This
is the second most popular question, so I

00:27:28.890 --> 00:27:33.549
put it at the end to lead into the questions
you might ask. Relationships do matter. I'm

00:27:33.549 --> 00:27:38.410
sure you hear this a lot, but I've been doing
this for over 20 years and the access that

00:27:38.410 --> 00:27:46.130
Mike and I got to people to understand their
vision of the media business was really important.

00:27:46.130 --> 00:27:50.809
And you get very different visions from different
people you talk to, from big media companies

00:27:50.809 --> 00:27:56.030
to small start-ups, and where they see their
place in this business. So, building those

00:27:56.030 --> 00:28:01.950
relationships over the years was really important.
Also, curiosity is important. So, one of the

00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:07.200
things--. I'm a, have been a television specialist
and Mike is a social media guy.

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:13.110
That's his background. But the curiosity to
understand this business in a broader way,

00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:19.240
you need to have broader business knowledge.
You can't just know one thing anymore. But

00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:24.490
then, on the same token, one person can't
know everything, right? But you need to understand

00:28:24.490 --> 00:28:29.030
this business more broadly. And it's important
that the people you hire and the people that

00:28:29.030 --> 00:28:33.250
we hire at the agency, have the curiosity
and the desire to wanna know more.

00:28:33.250 --> 00:28:40.061
And you can't be territorial. This one is--.
Every time I talk to people about, "How are

00:28:40.061 --> 00:28:44.610
you and Mike working together?" Like, we have
so many struggles with TV and digital people

00:28:44.610 --> 00:28:50.770
working together. And you just can't be territorial.
The one thing I will say is Mike is one of

00:28:50.770 --> 00:28:55.330
the few digital people who've I met, who is
really passionate about TV.

00:28:55.330 --> 00:29:00.900
There's no chip on his shoulder that digital
is better than TV. And vice versa, that TV

00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:04.860
is better than digital. And we really need
to make sure we're forging these relationships,

00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:10.049
both at the agency side and on the media company's
side, that the groups are all working together.

00:29:10.049 --> 00:29:15.940
And we say it a lot and it's easy to say and
it makes total sense, but it actually happening

00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:17.910
is not easy.

00:29:17.910 --> 00:29:23.100
And I think the reason why Mike and I have
been successful in doing this over the last

00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:27.860
year or so, is because we just work really
well together and recognize that I couldn't

00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:31.800
have done this on my own and he couldn't have
done this on his own. But together, we were

00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:36.750
able to really create something that we think
adds value to our clients.

00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:38.200
[pause]

00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:42.530
Still a few challenges ahead. There's been
a lot of experimentation in this space over

00:29:42.530 --> 00:29:46.530
the last year. And there will continue to
be experimentation. Most of the experimentation

00:29:46.530 --> 00:29:50.480
is on the content creator side and what kind
of things should they be creating in this

00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:57.880
space. Some advertisers have come in and done
some interesting sponsorships of this content.

00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:01.299
And you'll think you'll see a little bit more
of that. But the experimentation isn't gonna

00:30:01.299 --> 00:30:05.530
last forever. If we can't prove that this
stuff is working for our clients, there's

00:30:05.530 --> 00:30:09.580
only so much money they're gonna put behind
it. So, we need to make sure that we build

00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:13.470
the right measurement plans into all of these
deals that we're creating.

00:30:13.470 --> 00:30:18.190
And the other thing is messaging and making
sure that we have the right messaging for

00:30:18.190 --> 00:30:22.710
the different platforms. So, we can't just
take our TV creative and run it online and

00:30:22.710 --> 00:30:27.240
take pieces of it and shorten it. So, making
sure, which is why the creatives need to be

00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:31.230
involved from the very beginning, is if we're
recommending all these platforms for our clients

00:30:31.230 --> 00:30:35.080
and they creatively need to be making sure
that they're building what they should be

00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:36.210
for those platforms.

00:30:36.210 --> 00:30:41.059
So, those, I think, are the shifts you're
gonna see over the next year. Thank you for

00:30:41.059 --> 00:30:45.200
coming and listening. I'm happy to sit down
and answer some questions if you have any.

00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:49.780
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Just so that you guys know,
for here in the audience, there are mics in

00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:57.730
the back. But for those of you that are either
out of this room, or don't want to stand up

00:30:57.730 --> 00:31:05.580
at a mic, you can go to TricksPage social
space TV space questions and input your questions

00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:07.090
there. And we can answer them.

00:31:07.090 --> 00:31:13.530
But coming out of that--I'm just gonna kick-start
some stuff off--with the fact that there are

00:31:13.530 --> 00:31:19.299
so many different opportunities now and so
many media companies have so many opportunities

00:31:19.299 --> 00:31:27.270
for you, as an agency, to take a look at.
How do you like media companies to approach

00:31:27.270 --> 00:31:31.210
you? As a total bundle, or one-off?

00:31:31.210 --> 00:31:37.780
&gt;&gt;Stacey Shepatin: A total bundle. It's a
lot easier for us to evaluate it if it's all

00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:43.700
together. It's much more challenging and much
more time-consuming for us to try and negotiate

00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:44.950
every single deal separately.

00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:53.270
So, if we're doing a deal with NBC and we
wanna look at check-ins and all other kinds

00:31:53.270 --> 00:31:59.280
of things, it would be great if NBC came to
us with a platform that was television plus

00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:06.070
"GetGlue" plus "Viggle" plus what they're
doing on whichever website, whichever show

00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:10.650
that it is, so that we can evaluate it as
a total platform.

00:32:10.650 --> 00:32:17.140
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Good. And part and parcel
to that, when you, as an agency, don't have

00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:19.750
everything and you're working with other agencies--

00:32:19.750 --> 00:32:20.750
&gt;&gt;Stacey Shepatin: Mm-hmm.

00:32:20.750 --> 00:32:24.640
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: how do you manage that?
How does it work? Who takes the lead?

00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:28.210
&gt;&gt;Stacey Shepatin: I mean, I think we have
to work together. So, if we're putting a plan

00:32:28.210 --> 00:32:35.799
together with another agency--a media plan--for
our clients, we, the idea could come through

00:32:35.799 --> 00:32:40.620
either through a digital group or through
a TV group. But we have to figure out how

00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:42.600
to work together to negotiate it.

00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:46.929
So, that's where that territorial piece I
talked about comes into play, is you really

00:32:46.929 --> 00:32:53.049
can't be territorial in a situation like that.
Our clients don't want us to be, and get frustrated

00:32:53.049 --> 00:32:58.950
when we are. They just want us to figure it
out. So, the lead tends to come from either

00:32:58.950 --> 00:33:03.830
where the idea came from or where the bulk
of the money is. And that tends to drive the

00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:04.830
negotiation.

00:33:04.830 --> 00:33:10.429
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: OK. Do I have some questions
from the audience there?

00:33:10.429 --> 00:33:16.360
&gt;&gt;Stacey Shepatin: [ whispers indistinctly
].

00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:27.660
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Anybody? Anyone out there?
Here we go.

00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:30.309
&gt;&gt;Stacey Shepatin: Yeah.

00:33:30.309 --> 00:33:32.298
&gt;&gt;Female #1: I saw that you mentioned the
study that you did--

00:33:32.298 --> 00:33:33.298
&gt;&gt;Stacey Shepatin: Mm-hmm.

00:33:33.298 --> 00:33:34.298
&gt;&gt;Female #1: where people who saw complementary
ads online--

00:33:34.298 --> 00:33:35.298
&gt;&gt;Stacey Shepatin: Mm-hmm.

00:33:35.298 --> 00:33:36.298
&gt;&gt;Female #1: while you're watching TV where
the brand recall was almost as high as the

00:33:36.298 --> 00:33:37.298
undistracted.

00:33:37.298 --> 00:33:38.298
&gt;&gt;Stacey Shepatin: Yeah.

00:33:38.298 --> 00:33:39.298
&gt;&gt;Female #1: Have you seen any examples of
advertisers that they're doing that well?

00:33:39.298 --> 00:33:40.298
Or, having the ability--?

00:33:40.298 --> 00:33:41.298
&gt;&gt;Stacey Shepatin: So, I think it's just starting.
So, we're working with some companies in the

00:33:41.298 --> 00:33:42.298
synced ads space. So, SecondScreen Networks
is one of the companies that's out there that

00:33:42.298 --> 00:33:44.799
Hill Holiday has a partnership with. They're
part of our Beacon Program, which is a program

00:33:44.799 --> 00:33:50.179
for start-ups, where we help guide them and
test out their technologies and hopefully

00:33:50.179 --> 00:33:52.700
find ways to sell them through to our clients.

00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:57.990
So, SecondScreen is a company that's building
an ad network to try and create this synced

00:33:57.990 --> 00:34:03.480
ad experience. They've done some stuff. I
think it was with Lincoln Mercury with one

00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:08.970
of the NBC cable networks that was pretty
successful. So, I think as we're doing some

00:34:08.970 --> 00:34:13.190
testing to see if this environment works,
you'll see more stuff happening in this space.

00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:17.629
&gt;&gt;Female #1: And how is, the people sign up
for the agency site as well--

00:34:17.629 --> 00:34:18.629
&gt;&gt;Stacey Shepatin: Mm-hmm?

00:34:18.629 --> 00:34:23.240
&gt;&gt;Female #1: so how are you allocating budgets
between--and I know it has to be territorial--

00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:24.240
&gt;&gt;Stacey Shepatin: Mm-hmm.

00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:27.639
&gt;&gt;Female #1: is that a joint budget, or is
it a TV budget or a digital budget?

00:34:27.639 --> 00:34:31.809
&gt;&gt;Stacey Shepatin: You know, I get asked that
question a lot. It's sort of--. We have a

00:34:31.809 --> 00:34:35.509
budget. And we may have a TV budget and a
digital budget. And as we're working through

00:34:35.509 --> 00:34:39.339
these plans, we figure it out as we go along,
whether it's gonna come out of the TV budget

00:34:39.339 --> 00:34:44.320
or the digital budget. It depends what's part
of the deal.

00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:51.139
So, if it's full episode play or digital video,
it tends to come out of the TV budget. If

00:34:51.139 --> 00:34:57.039
it's some of these other things, it may come
out of the digital budget. But we try not

00:34:57.039 --> 00:35:01.900
to keep the budgets so siloed, so that we
have the opportunity to evaluate plans like

00:35:01.900 --> 00:35:04.319
this and we have the money to be able to do
it.

00:35:04.319 --> 00:35:05.319
[pause]

00:35:05.319 --> 00:35:09.390
It also helps to try and build these plans
before the budgets are allocated, so that

00:35:09.390 --> 00:35:13.119
we can go to the client and say, "This is
what we wanna do," and it gets taken out of

00:35:13.119 --> 00:35:14.210
the overall budget.

00:35:14.210 --> 00:35:15.310
&gt;&gt;Female #1: Great.

00:35:15.310 --> 00:35:16.400
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Umm.

00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:17.500
&gt;&gt;Stacey Shepatin: Someone at the mic.

00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:18.500
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Yeah.

00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:19.500
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Hi, Stacey. I'm Mark.

00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:20.500
&gt;&gt;Stacey Shepatin: Hi.

00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:21.539
&gt;&gt;Male #1: I have a variation of the same
question.

00:35:21.539 --> 00:35:22.539
&gt;&gt;Stacey Shepatin: Yeah.

00:35:22.539 --> 00:35:27.339
&gt;&gt;Male #1: I've noticed a lot of programs
are now inviting their viewers to go to their

00:35:27.339 --> 00:35:31.460
website and download a synchronized application.
I was watching "The Walking Dead" on Sunday.

00:35:31.460 --> 00:35:32.460
&gt;&gt;Stacey Shepatin: Mm-hmm.

00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:36.470
&gt;&gt;Male #1: And for a couple of episodes now,
they've invited you to do a Story Sync.

00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:37.520
&gt;&gt;Stacey Shepatin: Yep.

00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:42.950
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Which of the, either programs or
networks, are doing that most effectively

00:35:42.950 --> 00:35:46.769
from an advertiser perspective? Like, the
ones that are most advertiser friendly.

00:35:46.769 --> 00:35:51.410
&gt;&gt;Stacey Shepatin: Yup. I would say the NBCU
cable networks and AMC are probably doing

00:35:51.410 --> 00:35:56.710
the most in that space right now and have
had the most success from an advertiser standpoint.

00:35:56.710 --> 00:36:01.339
And again, I talked before about there's some
programs that lend themselves to this better

00:36:01.339 --> 00:36:06.420
than others. So, just because a network isn't
doing it well, may mean that they just don't

00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:08.029
have the right programming to do this with.

00:36:08.029 --> 00:36:11.721
So, "Walking Dead" has a very cult following.
There's a lot of interesting stuff you can

00:36:11.721 --> 00:36:18.990
do with zombies and that kind of stuff. And
Bravo has all kinds of reality programming

00:36:18.990 --> 00:36:25.130
that lends itself to companion content. They
have digital story-telling now. Their whole

00:36:25.130 --> 00:36:29.529
transmedia play that is bringing people back
onto the shows.

00:36:29.529 --> 00:36:33.999
So, I think their programming lends itself
well and they've been experimenting a lot

00:36:33.999 --> 00:36:37.589
in this area. And they've probably been the
most successful to date.

00:36:37.589 --> 00:36:38.589
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Thanks.

00:36:38.589 --> 00:36:39.589
&gt;&gt;Stacey Shepatin: Mm-hmm.

00:36:39.589 --> 00:36:41.969
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: There's a question back
there with Aaron. And if you have questions,

00:36:41.969 --> 00:36:44.009
please go to the mics just so that they can
be recorded.

00:36:44.009 --> 00:36:50.630
&gt;&gt;Male #2: Hi, Stacey. There's a lot of data,
a lot of publicity around the number of tweets

00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:54.630
around certain ads, certain programs, etcetera.
And then sometimes, you hear some mention

00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:59.210
about sentiment, whether it's positive or
negative. Have you seen much evidence that

00:36:59.210 --> 00:37:02.680
the data that goes beyond that is of high
quality?

00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:09.390
So, for example, can you tell from the tweets,
demographics or interests, things like that?

00:37:09.390 --> 00:37:13.410
Have you seen that sort of data? What is the
quality of that data? I guess my second question

00:37:13.410 --> 00:37:18.369
would be, do you feel like there's any sort
of bias among the people that are tweeting

00:37:18.369 --> 00:37:20.820
that you have to discount when you're analyzing
this information?

00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:26.529
&gt;&gt;Stacey Shepatin: Yeah. So, Bluefin's done
a lot with sentiment. And sentiment's hard

00:37:26.529 --> 00:37:33.520
to measure. We did some testing with them
and found that things weren't allocated correctly

00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:37.690
to positive or negative sentiments. So, I
think we--. You really have to look at that

00:37:37.690 --> 00:37:44.000
stuff closely. But there are a lot of these
algorithms that are being built that are getting

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:53.719
at stuff that's pretty valuable to us, that
the male/female of who's tweeting, age--general.

00:37:53.719 --> 00:38:00.180
So, I think we are getting more specifics
about who those people are. I mean, I think

00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:06.559
we know that the people who are tweeting are
not the minority , right? They're not as large

00:38:06.559 --> 00:38:11.290
of an audience as what we're getting on TV,
but they're pretty influential. We don't really

00:38:11.290 --> 00:38:16.019
know how many people they're really reaching
with what they're saying.

00:38:16.019 --> 00:38:24.119
But we have to pay close attention to it because
they have a pretty powerful impact on our

00:38:24.119 --> 00:38:30.400
brands. If they're talking about our brands
and they are saying great things and saying,

00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:37.330
"Oh, you should try it," that's somebody who's
sought out these social impressions. And that's

00:38:37.330 --> 00:38:41.719
a pretty valuable thing. So, we want to create
environments where people can have that kind

00:38:41.719 --> 00:38:44.150
of conversation about our brands.

00:38:44.150 --> 00:38:47.089
But I think there's still more to learn. We
don't know everything about who those people

00:38:47.089 --> 00:38:52.819
are who are tweeting. And it is hard to filter
out some of the stuff you're talking about.

00:38:52.819 --> 00:38:53.819
[pause]

00:38:53.819 --> 00:38:54.819
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Question over here.

00:38:54.819 --> 00:38:55.819
&gt;&gt;Female #2: Yeah. Hi.

00:38:55.819 --> 00:38:56.819
&gt;&gt;Stacey Shepatin: Hi.

00:38:56.819 --> 00:39:03.460
&gt;&gt;Female #2: I read a quote this morning,
Marc Pritchard of P and G, talking about the

00:39:03.460 --> 00:39:08.509
importance of building one-on-one relationships
with customers around the globe and essentially

00:39:08.509 --> 00:39:12.380
pointing towards a trend of spending less
on broadcast and more on mobile and social.

00:39:12.380 --> 00:39:13.380
&gt;&gt;Stacey Shepatin: Mm-hmm.

00:39:13.380 --> 00:39:16.529
&gt;&gt;Female #2: And I'm just curious to what
extant--. Obviously, they are a global brand

00:39:16.529 --> 00:39:22.710
or have a number of global brands, but are
you seeing that pressure from people really

00:39:22.710 --> 00:39:25.700
shifting heavily on the budgets towards mobile
and social?

00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:30.680
&gt;&gt;Stacey Shepatin: I wouldn't say "shifting
heavily." I mean, P and G is huge brand with

00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:37.809
huge budgets that has the opportunity to shift
a little and not have a major impact. I definitely

00:39:37.809 --> 00:39:44.009
see the--. I mean, as more people are using
these different devices, then we need to find

00:39:44.009 --> 00:39:46.249
ways to market to them appropriately in those
devices.

00:39:46.249 --> 00:39:52.880
So, the more people who have mobile phones
and are using mobile phones to transact and

00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:56.670
go to stores and do all these things, and
we need to find ways to market to them there.

00:39:56.670 --> 00:40:01.400
So, you will be seeing more dollars shifting
in that area, and social as well. I mean,

00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:06.390
all the things we're talking about, there's
just more ways to reach your audience in social

00:40:06.390 --> 00:40:09.579
and there are powerful people that we need
to reach.

00:40:09.579 --> 00:40:14.349
So, you will some shift. I don't know that
when you say "major," I don't know that you're

00:40:14.349 --> 00:40:19.559
gonna see 20 percent shifts, 25 percent shifts
in dollars, but you are gonna see some dollars

00:40:19.559 --> 00:40:21.019
moving in that area.

00:40:21.019 --> 00:40:22.019
[pause]

00:40:22.019 --> 00:40:24.240
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Back over here.

00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:30.269
&gt;&gt;Female #3: Hi. Beyond Twitter and Facebook,
have you seen other social platforms being

00:40:30.269 --> 00:40:36.279
utilized effectively by programmers and advertising,
advertisers, the Foursquares, the Pinterest,

00:40:36.279 --> 00:40:37.930
the Instagrams of the world?

00:40:37.930 --> 00:40:41.739
&gt;&gt;Stacey Shepatin: Yeah. I haven't seen--.
Pinterest is probably something we should

00:40:41.739 --> 00:40:47.509
watch because I think you're gonna see more
with it now. Definitely like the GetGlues

00:40:47.509 --> 00:40:54.299
and Misos and IntoNows and all the check-ins,
I think are being used in a good way. GetGlue

00:40:54.299 --> 00:40:58.880
has done a lot of, has a lot of relationships
with the networks and they're doing some really

00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:01.329
interesting things with retailers and offers.

00:41:01.329 --> 00:41:06.010
So, I think we've seen some success in that
area. And I think we talk about Twitter just

00:41:06.010 --> 00:41:11.279
because it's easy for us to measure and follow
Twitter, right? So, we probably talk about

00:41:11.279 --> 00:41:17.329
them more even though there's more people
on Facebook, fans of all of these shows, but

00:41:17.329 --> 00:41:21.509
we just don't have as much information about
them. Those are the two dominant ones, but

00:41:21.509 --> 00:41:23.859
there's definitely others that are having
impact.

00:41:23.859 --> 00:41:24.859
[pause]

00:41:24.859 --> 00:41:26.059
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Back here.

00:41:26.059 --> 00:41:30.759
&gt;&gt;Male #3: Yeah. Kind of going off that, we
were talking about bringing television into

00:41:30.759 --> 00:41:35.549
the social experience. But is there a reverse
of the television experience coming into social--?

00:41:35.549 --> 00:41:39.809
Like, partnering with Time Warner Cable. Almost
doing like a user match, like "we know this

00:41:39.809 --> 00:41:44.680
person is watching such and such right now.
Why are not we not syncing up ads with that?"

00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:45.680
&gt;&gt;Stacey Shepatin: Mm-hmm.

00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:48.970
&gt;&gt;Male #3: So, is there experimentation going
on with that or what have you seen?

00:41:48.970 --> 00:41:53.979
&gt;&gt;Stacey Shepatin: Yeah. I mean, I think the
big thing that we're seeing, or the big need

00:41:53.979 --> 00:41:59.329
that we're seeing across, is the need for
single-source measurement. So, the ability

00:41:59.329 --> 00:42:04.640
to be able to measure all media in a way that
it's comparable.

00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:09.930
So, television measurement and impressions
have been around for a really long time--the

00:42:09.930 --> 00:42:15.559
CPNs and GRPEs--and moving towards that in
these other spaces is probably the place where

00:42:15.559 --> 00:42:20.059
you see we're trying to sync up as most. There's
definitely testing going on in that space.

00:42:20.059 --> 00:42:25.400
I'm not familiar with any particular example,
but I definitely think you'll see some testing

00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:26.400
in that area.

00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:27.400
[pause]

00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:28.400
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Back here.

00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:32.119
&gt;&gt;Male #4: An example of combining old technology
and new technology--. I'm asking for a friend

00:42:32.119 --> 00:42:35.579
who just can't seem, my friend, Ellis, , who
can't seem to find the document to ask. So,

00:42:35.579 --> 00:42:40.569
forgive me if I'm losing the question in translation.
But Ellie was curious to know that as you

00:42:40.569 --> 00:42:44.609
talk about shifting budgets, is this interesting
to clients because it's social or because

00:42:44.609 --> 00:42:48.459
this is a digital of measurement. In essence,
a digital layer applied to a television, which

00:42:48.459 --> 00:42:52.269
traditionally, it doesn't offer the degree
of granular measurement that digital sometimes

00:42:52.269 --> 00:42:53.269
does?

00:42:53.269 --> 00:42:57.529
Is the future demanding social elements as
added value for TV buys, or are people warming

00:42:57.529 --> 00:43:00.640
to the idea of buying digital content to cover
off devices?

00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:04.450
&gt;&gt;Stacey Shepatin: OK. There were a lot of
questions there. So, the one that connected

00:43:04.450 --> 00:43:06.950
with me the most was, "Do clients want it
as added value?"

00:43:06.950 --> 00:43:07.950
&gt;&gt;Male #4: Sure.

00:43:07.950 --> 00:43:09.279
&gt;&gt;Stacey Shepatin: Of course they do.

00:43:09.279 --> 00:43:10.279
[laughter]

00:43:10.279 --> 00:43:16.390
Without a doubt. I mean, they still want digital
as added value for our television buys. So,

00:43:16.390 --> 00:43:19.209
it's hard to get clients to pay for something
that they don't know what they're getting

00:43:19.209 --> 00:43:26.709
for it, right? So, the measurement piece of
it is important. Go back to the first part

00:43:26.709 --> 00:43:29.650
of your question.

00:43:29.650 --> 00:43:34.660
&gt;&gt;Male #4: Is this interesting to clients
because it's social or because it's digital

00:43:34.660 --> 00:43:35.680
with measurement?

00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:42.140
&gt;&gt;Stacey Shepatin: It's interesting to clients
because it's, you can see the power that these

00:43:42.140 --> 00:43:49.079
people are having in this space. So, it's
people are choosing to interact with your

00:43:49.079 --> 00:43:54.150
brand. So, whether it's Facebook fans or people
talking about it or voting or whatever it

00:43:54.150 --> 00:43:58.180
is, we look at these as choice-based impressions,
right?

00:43:58.180 --> 00:44:03.829
People who are seeking out to comment, talk,
and engage with your brand. So, that's why

00:44:03.829 --> 00:44:08.249
it's important to them because these people
have a lot of influence on other people. So

00:44:08.249 --> 00:44:11.579
that's why they're paying attention because
it's getting to a scale that they need to

00:44:11.579 --> 00:44:12.579
pay attention to it.

00:44:12.579 --> 00:44:13.769
&gt;&gt;Male #4: So, let me ask a follow-up question
to that.

00:44:13.769 --> 00:44:14.769
&gt;&gt;Stacey Shepatin: Yeah.

00:44:14.769 --> 00:44:19.279
&gt;&gt;Male #4: How do assign a value then, to
a tweet or a like, or any of these interactions?

00:44:19.279 --> 00:44:22.049
&gt;&gt;Stacey Shepatin: Yeah. I don't know that
I have the answer to that. That's what we're

00:44:22.049 --> 00:44:25.829
trying to figure out. What is the value of
that when you don't know how many people it's

00:44:25.829 --> 00:44:28.920
really reaching? I don't know the answer,
but we're working on it.

00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:29.920
[pause]

00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:31.049
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Back here?

00:44:31.049 --> 00:44:32.329
&gt;&gt;Male #5: Hi.

00:44:32.329 --> 00:44:33.609
&gt;&gt;Stacey Shepatin: Hi.

00:44:33.609 --> 00:44:38.420
&gt;&gt;Male #5: From the examples you gave in the
interactions that you see and that you're

00:44:38.420 --> 00:44:42.890
trying to measure socially, it seems like
this is all dependent upon the programming

00:44:42.890 --> 00:44:46.549
being synchronously live, like happening at
the same time. A lot of people are seeing

00:44:46.549 --> 00:44:50.099
it at the same time. Is that a fair assessment?

00:44:50.099 --> 00:44:55.640
&gt;&gt;Stacey Shepatin: I mean, a lot of it happens
live--people watching it. So, you're asking

00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:59.269
what happens in a DVR environment or when
people aren't watching it at the same time?

00:44:59.269 --> 00:45:00.269
Is it as relevant to them?

00:45:00.269 --> 00:45:01.269
&gt;&gt;Male #5: Yeah. That's where I was going.

00:45:01.269 --> 00:45:02.269
&gt;&gt;Stacey Shepatin: Yeah.

00:45:02.269 --> 00:45:03.269
&gt;&gt;Male #5: Yeah.

00:45:03.269 --> 00:45:08.470
&gt;&gt;Stacey Shepatin: So, yes and no. I think
that the content creators are trying to figure

00:45:08.470 --> 00:45:13.700
out how to make sure that all of this works
in a DVR environment so it doesn't have to

00:45:13.700 --> 00:45:17.499
happen live. I mean, with the voting stuff,
it has to happen within two hours.

00:45:17.499 --> 00:45:22.910
So, it somewhat has to happen live. But there
are other things that are being created that

00:45:22.910 --> 00:45:29.109
don't have to happen right within that hour
time period. And that will allow you the couple

00:45:29.109 --> 00:45:34.200
of days to watch the show and be a part of
it. So, I think they understand that they

00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:37.849
need to create it in a way that it would work
in a time-shifted environment as well.

00:45:37.849 --> 00:45:38.849
&gt;&gt;Male #5: OK. Thanks.

00:45:38.849 --> 00:45:39.849
&gt;&gt;Stacey Shepatin: Yup.

00:45:39.849 --> 00:45:40.849
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Back here.

00:45:40.849 --> 00:45:41.849
&gt;&gt;Male #6: Hi. How are you?

00:45:41.849 --> 00:45:42.849
&gt;&gt;Stacey Shepatin: I'm good.

00:45:42.849 --> 00:45:45.999
&gt;&gt;Male #6: My name's Matt. I think there's
a number of folks here work in a sales capacity

00:45:45.999 --> 00:45:51.269
at Google. And I'd just be curious, maybe
you could give us a little advice. I think

00:45:51.269 --> 00:45:57.569
social TV is probably a challenging sell because
it feels somewhat unpredictable to a client.

00:45:57.569 --> 00:46:02.430
I guess, both in the fact that you present
them the idea of social and maybe they'd be

00:46:02.430 --> 00:46:04.769
like, "Well, what are they gonna say about
my brand?"

00:46:04.769 --> 00:46:09.230
That's unpredictable. But also, I'm used to
putting in money and getting out impressions

00:46:09.230 --> 00:46:13.490
in a very linear, planned way throughout the
course of the year. And that creates the things

00:46:13.490 --> 00:46:18.690
I expect to be created at the time I expect
it. And so, social TV has both those--or social

00:46:18.690 --> 00:46:21.480
in general--has both those risks to them.

00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:22.480
&gt;&gt;Stacey Shepatin: Mm-hmm.

00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:24.579
&gt;&gt;Male #6: So, when you're talking to risk
adverse clients--

00:46:24.579 --> 00:46:25.579
&gt;&gt;Stacey Shepatin: Yeah.

00:46:25.579 --> 00:46:28.709
&gt;&gt;Male #6: we'd love to hear some of the tricks
that you use and some of the ways you sell.

00:46:28.709 --> 00:46:32.390
&gt;&gt;Stacey Shepatin: So, one of the things I've
been--. There's probably two really important

00:46:32.390 --> 00:46:38.009
things as we're selling these social TV programs
through to our clients. The first is, we know

00:46:38.009 --> 00:46:41.719
that it costs a lot of money to produce this
additional content, right? It's not free to

00:46:41.719 --> 00:46:46.920
create all of this companion content to the
programming, to build the relationships with

00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:48.930
GetGlue, and all of these other things.

00:46:48.930 --> 00:46:54.059
But if the networks or content creators are
gonna try and pass all of those costs onto

00:46:54.059 --> 00:46:59.789
us, on the advertiser, it's not gonna happen
because we don't really know what we're getting

00:46:59.789 --> 00:47:06.250
out of it. So, there has to be a relationship
there where we're in this together and we're

00:47:06.250 --> 00:47:09.079
trying to figure it out together. So that's
one.

00:47:09.079 --> 00:47:13.969
And then, the second thing is building in
measurement where we can figure out whether

00:47:13.969 --> 00:47:18.560
this is really working or not because clients
are only gonna test for so long. And if we

00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:23.991
can't figure out if this is really working
and having an impact on the brand, then they're

00:47:23.991 --> 00:47:28.799
not gonna keep doing it. So, I would say those
are the two keys when we're, what we need

00:47:28.799 --> 00:47:32.400
from media partner as we're presenting these
to our clients.

00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:37.020
&gt;&gt;Male #6: Cool. And just a quick follow-up.
Do you find that to be predictable, do you

00:47:37.020 --> 00:47:42.259
find the outcomes that you expect generally
happen for clients, or do you find that it's

00:47:42.259 --> 00:47:45.809
all over the board what winds up happening
in a social TV campaign?

00:47:45.809 --> 00:47:53.839
&gt;&gt;Stacey Shepatin: I think some of it is predictable
and some things work and some things don't.

00:47:53.839 --> 00:48:00.269
I'm trying to think of a specific example
of--. I think, intuitively, when we did the

00:48:00.269 --> 00:48:05.769
synced ad test, and we haven't done it in
reality yet. We're getting there with one

00:48:05.769 --> 00:48:08.969
of our clients. And they do it in very near
future.

00:48:08.969 --> 00:48:15.709
I think, intuitively, we knew that a synced
ad would bring it back up at least from that

00:48:15.709 --> 00:48:20.819
second group that've seen a completely different
ad, but we didn't know it was gonna come back

00:48:20.819 --> 00:48:27.180
up as high as it did. So, if we're learning
things like that, those are gonna be big wins

00:48:27.180 --> 00:48:33.749
to be able to measure things like that. So,
I would say, intuitively, a lot is reaffirmed,

00:48:33.749 --> 00:48:38.039
but we're definitely learning and finding
things that aren't what we expected.

00:48:38.039 --> 00:48:39.469
&gt;&gt;Male #6: Thank you very much.

00:48:39.469 --> 00:48:40.469
&gt;&gt;Stacey Shepatin: Mm-hmm.

00:48:40.469 --> 00:48:41.469
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: This one.

00:48:41.469 --> 00:48:44.949
&gt;&gt;Male #7: Hi. First, I have a couple thoughts
on TV versus social media that I wanna get

00:48:44.949 --> 00:48:49.900
your feedback on. I think one of the reason
why TV will stay powerful for a long time,

00:48:49.900 --> 00:48:54.380
because I think it delivered the content in
a very scheduled way and a centralized way,

00:48:54.380 --> 00:48:56.589
whereas social media is very real-time.

00:48:56.589 --> 00:49:02.449
But the information is also very scattered
and very chaotic. And so, when people are

00:49:02.449 --> 00:49:07.109
consuming the product, the information, in
a very segmented way, people are still looking

00:49:07.109 --> 00:49:15.019
for a real live event, almost in a way that,
say, I know that on Sunday night at 9 PM that

00:49:15.019 --> 00:49:18.839
I can watch "The Walking Dead." And then,
I can have some event I can talk about.

00:49:18.839 --> 00:49:19.839
&gt;&gt;Stacey Shepatin: Right.

00:49:19.839 --> 00:49:22.190
&gt;&gt;Male #7: So, basis of the social needs of
people want to get it together,--

00:49:22.190 --> 00:49:23.190
&gt;&gt;Stacey Shepatin: Right.

00:49:23.190 --> 00:49:25.539
&gt;&gt;Male #7: but social media wouldn't be able
to provide that. Do you think that's--?

00:49:25.539 --> 00:49:28.489
&gt;&gt;Stacey Shepatin: Yeah. I agree with you.
I think the way Mike and I talk about it is

00:49:28.489 --> 00:49:32.950
TV has always been social. It's just now,
you can talk about it instantly, right? So

00:49:32.950 --> 00:49:37.049
before, you used to go into work the next
day and you have that water cooler, right?

00:49:37.049 --> 00:49:40.200
It was a water cooler shows, those NBC comedies,
"Seinfeld" or whatever.

00:49:40.200 --> 00:49:45.079
You talk about it with your friends the next
day. We talk about social media, and now it's

00:49:45.079 --> 00:49:49.910
your virtual water cooler. You have the ability
to talk to people about it right then in that

00:49:49.910 --> 00:49:55.579
moment, or within a period of time, about
the experience that you're having or have

00:49:55.579 --> 00:50:00.969
just had. So, I don't think it's a huge shift
in behavior, which is why I don't think television

00:50:00.969 --> 00:50:04.160
is dying because people have always behaved
this way.

00:50:04.160 --> 00:50:07.599
Now, they just have a different outlet to
do it--a more instant outlet to do it.

00:50:07.599 --> 00:50:11.769
&gt;&gt;Male #7: Right. So, that leads to my second
question, which is when it comes to implementing

00:50:11.769 --> 00:50:17.799
the social media content, do you think the
agencies are shifting of updating real-time

00:50:17.799 --> 00:50:24.220
to say, do a bit of content almost the same
way as how TV people do the content? Like,

00:50:24.220 --> 00:50:29.210
every Tuesday I'm gonna post this kind of
content. Every Wednesday--. Do you think that

00:50:29.210 --> 00:50:31.759
will be some of the best practice that we'll
do, or--?

00:50:31.759 --> 00:50:35.170
&gt;&gt;Stacey Shepatin: You know, I don't know
because we hear so much about content needing

00:50:35.170 --> 00:50:42.309
to be on-demand and moving away from a schedule.
So, I don't get the sense that the content

00:50:42.309 --> 00:50:47.789
is being created and delivered on a schedule
in the digital space. So, I'm not sure that

00:50:47.789 --> 00:50:51.279
it's gonna be created that way because I think
that they want people to be able to access

00:50:51.279 --> 00:50:54.680
it whenever they wanna access it.

00:50:54.680 --> 00:50:59.539
But I think you're right. I mean, I think
there's this reassurance in knowing that there

00:50:59.539 --> 00:51:04.440
is a television schedule and people know when
things are gonna be on. And they set their

00:51:04.440 --> 00:51:10.630
DVRs or they watch it on VOD, or they watch
it on Hulu or Full Episode Play or within

00:51:10.630 --> 00:51:14.400
a certain amount of time because they wanna
be able to talk about it and experience it

00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:15.400
with someone else.

00:51:15.400 --> 00:51:18.470
So, I'm not sure that digital is gonna be
on that same schedule.

00:51:18.470 --> 00:51:19.520
&gt;&gt;Male #7: OK.

00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:21.329
&gt;&gt;Stacey Shepatin: What do you think?

00:51:21.329 --> 00:51:25.769
&gt;&gt;Male #7: I think it will eventually. And
I think that's what YouTube is trying to do.

00:51:25.769 --> 00:51:26.769
&gt;&gt;Stacey Shepatin: Yes.

00:51:26.769 --> 00:51:31.190
&gt;&gt;Male #7: They're trying to mock what TV
is doing and have a set schedule, set channel.

00:51:31.190 --> 00:51:34.819
And I think that's how media is always evolving
after discovering--.

00:51:34.819 --> 00:51:36.569
&gt;&gt;Stacey Shepatin: It makes it easier to find.

00:51:36.569 --> 00:51:40.619
&gt;&gt;Male #7: Yeah. Like, how TV channels used
to start with one channel with every program.

00:51:40.619 --> 00:51:42.940
Then, they have different content for different
industry.

00:51:42.940 --> 00:51:43.940
&gt;&gt;Stacey Shepatin: Yeah.

00:51:43.940 --> 00:51:47.519
&gt;&gt;Male #7: Yeah. And my last question. I promise
it's the last one.

00:51:47.519 --> 00:51:48.519
[Stacey Shepatin laughs]

00:51:48.519 --> 00:51:53.949
So, I think for branding, it's a lot related
to how emotionally the consumer would be bonded

00:51:53.949 --> 00:51:54.949
to the brands.

00:51:54.949 --> 00:51:55.949
&gt;&gt;Stacey Shepatin: Yep.

00:51:55.949 --> 00:51:58.880
&gt;&gt;Male #7: And when you, when it comes to
social media, do you think--? I think it's

00:51:58.880 --> 00:52:03.109
still in the very early stage that it can,
you really affect how people are emotionally

00:52:03.109 --> 00:52:05.059
perceive the brand. What do you think of that?

00:52:05.059 --> 00:52:08.759
&gt;&gt;Stacey Shepatin: Yeah. I would agree with
you. I think that's what I'm, why when I was

00:52:08.759 --> 00:52:14.339
talking about before, you can have a big impact
on how people perceive your brand. So, we

00:52:14.339 --> 00:52:18.519
need to pay attention to what people are saying
and make sure we're marketing appropriately

00:52:18.519 --> 00:52:22.839
to them, to at least create an environment
for them to talk positively about your brand.

00:52:22.839 --> 00:52:27.829
&gt;&gt;Male #7: Do you have any specific measurement
that you can use to measure against how emotionally

00:52:27.829 --> 00:52:30.269
that impact on the brands on the consumers?

00:52:30.269 --> 00:52:31.579
&gt;&gt;Stacey Shepatin: How measurement--?

00:52:31.579 --> 00:52:36.170
&gt;&gt;Male #7: What kind of measurement that you
are using to measure against how emotionally

00:52:36.170 --> 00:52:40.630
that the information can have influence on
the brands when it comes to social media?

00:52:40.630 --> 00:52:46.450
&gt;&gt;Stacey Shepatin: So, we're working on putting
those kinds of research tools in place to

00:52:46.450 --> 00:52:50.509
be able to figure out what kind of impact
that social conversation is having on our

00:52:50.509 --> 00:52:53.609
brands. So, we're working through that now.
I'm not sure what all the companies are that

00:52:53.609 --> 00:52:54.849
we're using to get there.

00:52:54.849 --> 00:52:58.489
But there's a lot of companies in this space
that are measuring what people are saying.

00:52:58.489 --> 00:53:03.700
And we just need to put it together in a way
that it's usable for our clients.

00:53:03.700 --> 00:53:04.700
&gt;&gt;Male #7: Thank you.

00:53:04.700 --> 00:53:08.630
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: OK. And I think we have
a final question before we have to wrap up.

00:53:08.630 --> 00:53:12.019
&gt;&gt;Female #4: I'll just wrap it up. Actually,
he got a lot of my questions, too, but so

00:53:12.019 --> 00:53:17.579
I have a new one. [laughs] I'm sure it's probably
referenced in your book, but since we're here

00:53:17.579 --> 00:53:22.970
in the home of Google, I'm just curious your
perspective on YouTube as a social tool, how

00:53:22.970 --> 00:53:28.199
that ties into the whole TV dynamic and how
valuable it is or isn't.

00:53:28.199 --> 00:53:32.469
&gt;&gt;Stacey Shepatin: YouTube in terms of how
they're creating programming now, their distribution?

00:53:32.469 --> 00:53:37.390
&gt;&gt;Female #4: Their brand. Really more for
brand-building and brand association with

00:53:37.390 --> 00:53:38.390
the content.

00:53:38.390 --> 00:53:42.290
&gt;&gt;Stacey Shepatin: Yeah. That's a good question
for Mike. And he's not here to answer it.

00:53:42.290 --> 00:53:49.999
So, I mean, I think YouTube is valuable as
a distribution for content--the YouTube channels

00:53:49.999 --> 00:53:56.850
and branded channels as a distribution for
the content we're creating. So, I mean, I

00:53:56.850 --> 00:54:00.509
think it's very valuable. Its obviously has
a tremendous reach.

00:54:00.509 --> 00:54:06.699
So, we need to make sure that we're using
it in the right way. I do think--not sure

00:54:06.699 --> 00:54:09.991
this quite answers your question--but I do
think, from a content standpoint, what they

00:54:09.991 --> 00:54:15.109
are doing now with creating content and trying
to compete with television programming is

00:54:15.109 --> 00:54:20.049
going to be interesting to watch to see if
people want to view programming and are willing

00:54:20.049 --> 00:54:25.119
to experiment and test out that programming
to gain some traction and some scale.

00:54:25.119 --> 00:54:31.940
So, YouTube's a valuable platform. I'm not
sure that quite answers your question, but

00:54:31.940 --> 00:54:32.940
next time we'll bring Mike.

00:54:32.940 --> 00:54:33.940
&gt;&gt;Female #4: Thanks.

00:54:33.940 --> 00:54:34.940
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: It's a good book, right?

00:54:34.940 --> 00:54:35.940
[laughter]

00:54:35.940 --> 00:54:36.940
&gt;&gt;Stacey Shepatin: And he'll answer that one
for you.

00:54:36.940 --> 00:54:39.259
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Well, Stacey, thank you
so much. The book is "Social TV." We have

00:54:39.259 --> 00:54:43.589
the lovely author here. And it's really a
terrific book. I've read it from cover to

00:54:43.589 --> 00:54:47.700
cover. It's a good resource, not only for
folks in the media business like ourselves,

00:54:47.700 --> 00:54:54.190
but even for anybody to have them basically
understand how TV is really growing and what

00:54:54.190 --> 00:55:00.069
once, TV was this fantastic medium and then
it got beat down into this traditional standpoint.

00:55:00.069 --> 00:55:05.239
It truly is a new medium and there's so many
more outputs for it. But it's a terrific book.

00:55:05.239 --> 00:55:12.660
Get yourself a copy. If you need to find it,
just email me at my LDAP. R-C-B-E-R-T-O at

00:55:12.660 --> 00:55:15.519
Google dot com. And thanks so much for your
time.

00:55:15.519 --> 00:55:16.519
&gt;&gt;Stacey Shepatin: Thank you.

00:55:16.519 --> 00:55:17.519
[applause]

00:55:17.519 --> 00:55:17.524
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: And thank you.
