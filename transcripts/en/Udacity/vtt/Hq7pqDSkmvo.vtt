00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.040
The first step to

00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.460
having an awesome web application
is having an awesome game plan.

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.220
Let's define what our prototype should
do after completing each iteration.

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.020
Let's do some brainstorming to make
a checklist of deliverables that we

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:13.080
want to achieve with each
iteration of development,

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.660
by breaking down the project into
smaller, easier to manage mini-projects.

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.340
In the first pass at this project,
we'll create mock-ups for

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.060
every page in the restaurant menu app,
and design URLs for each page as well.

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.970
When I finish this iteration,
I can show my designs to my friends or

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.190
colleagues for feedback, and that's
enough work for our first iteration.

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:31.660
In the second iteration,
you'll set up all of the routings for

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.240
your application in Flask,
making sure you can navigate to

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.520
all of the URLs you want to create for
your application.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.860
At the end of this iteration, you should
be able to navigate to all of your URLs,

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.710
even if the pages are not yet created.

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.660
After that, you will build on top of
what you made in the previous iteration

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:46.640
by creating all of your templates and
forms, and

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.870
making sure that they are properly
functioning within your application.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.930
Once you have created and filled
out all of your HTML templates and

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.360
see them rendering in your application,
we can move on to the next iteration.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.580
Now that you have a good grasp of
how your front-end code should look,

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.650
you will add the back-end functionality,
making sure all of the actions on

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:03.080
the web page are retrieving
data from your database.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.250
When all of the code operations
work on all of your web pages,

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.470
you'll be finished with this iteration.

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.060
You will then add some endpoints
that allow the data to be sent if

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.380
the client requests a menu or
specific menu item in JSON form.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.450
You will test these API calls
from within your browser to

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.230
know you have successfully
finished this step.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.870
Finally, you will add some
styling with CSS, JavaScript, and

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.820
a few static images, to give your
application an appealing layout.

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.390
In this step, you will also incorporate
message flashing into your application.

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.130
I chose these steps to create our
application because I feel they

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.090
naturally build on top of each other,
and

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.360
have a clear deliverable at
the end of each iteration.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.990
By keeping this in mind,
when you plan future projects,

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.400
you'll be better prepared for
all kinds of new challenges.
