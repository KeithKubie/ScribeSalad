00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.070
For a single route
example, our problem

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:10.270
is to find the optimal
number of discount seats

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:14.200
and regular seats to
sell to maximize revenue.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:19.160
We'll assume that the price
of regular seats is $617,

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.580
and the price of
discount seats is $238.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.850
Also, let's assume
that we forecasted

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:29.360
the demand of regular
seats to be 100,

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.810
and the demand of
discount seats to be 150.

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:37.450
The capacity of our
airplane is 166 seats.

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.270
Let's go ahead and formulate
this mathematically

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.280
as a linear
optimization problem.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.240
The first step is to decide
what our decisions are,

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.890
or the variables in our model.

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.650
We need to decide how many
regular seats we went to sell.

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:55.630
We'll call the number
of regular seats

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.900
we sell R. We also need to
decide the number of discount

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.320
seats we want to sell.

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:07.800
We'll call the number of
discount seats we sell D.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.620
The second step
is to decide what

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.220
our objective, or our goal, is.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.620
In this case, it's to
maximize the total revenue

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.500
to the airline.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.450
The revenue from
each type of seat

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.860
is equal to the number
of that type of seat

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.020
sold times the seat price.

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.390
In the case of
regular seats, this

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:34.229
is $617 times R, the number
of regular seats we sell.

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.740
And for discount seats,
this is $230 times D,

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.320
the number of discount
seats we sell.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.550
We sum these together to
get the total revenue,

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.680
and our objective is
to maximize this sum.

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.880
The third step is to define
the constraints, or limits,

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.640
of our decisions.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.470
One constraint is that American
Airlines can't sell more seats

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.970
than the aircraft capacity,
which is 166 seats.

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:10.169
So the total number of seats
sold, R + D has to be less than

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:14.600
or equal to the capacity of 166.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.910
Additionally, American Airlines
shouldn't sell more seats

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.590
than the demand for
each type of seat.

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.070
So the regular seats,
R, shouldn't exceed 100.

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.320
So R should be less
than or equal to 100.

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.000
And the discount seats,
D, can't exceed 150.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.240
So D should be less
than or equal to 150.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.090
The final step is to make
sure our variables are

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.100
taking reasonable values.

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.050
In this case, it
wouldn't make sense

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.300
to sell a negative
number of seats,

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.060
so we need to make sure
that both R and D are

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.600
greater than or equal to 0.

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.950
So our entire problem is to
maximize total airline revenue,

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.980
subject to the constraints
that seats sold can't exceed

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.560
capacity, seats sold
can't exceed demand,

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.220
and the seats sold
can't be negative.

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:15.250
Mathematically, this can be
written as maximize 617*R +

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.700
238*D, the total revenue,
subject to the constraints:

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.650
R + D is less than or equal to
166, the capacity constraint;

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.720
R less than or equal to 100,
and D less than or equal to 150,

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.770
which are the
demand constraints;

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:35.410
and R and D are both
greater than or equal to 0.

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.910
This is called a linear
optimization problem.

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.500
In the next video, we'll see
how to solve this problem using

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.760
the software, LibreOffice.
