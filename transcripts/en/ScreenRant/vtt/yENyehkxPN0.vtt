00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:11.390
As polished or hilarious as a movie script
might be, it usually pays to let talented

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:13.550
actors flex their muscles in front of the
camera.

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:17.340
Whether it's on-the-spot jokes, or in-the-moment
drama and action, the most memorable movie

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.530
moments come when the script is tossed out
the window.

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:22.570
Here are Screen Rant's 20 Greatest Unscripted
Movie Moments.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.770
The Avengers
As witty as writer/director Joss Whedon was

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.470
when it came to the script of The Avengers,
Robert Downey, Jr. did him one better.

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:38.140
When the script called for Iron Man to call
Thor "Shakespeare in the Park," Downey got

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.969
the idea, delivering one of the movie's biggest
laughs, right off the top of his head

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:45.649
X-Men
Hugh Jackman may have been called in to play

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:49.520
a live-action Wolverine at the last minute,
but he made his mark on the cast immediately.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.170
While filming his first scenes in Xavier mansion,
he decided to take an unscripted shot at Professor

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:02.629
X They 
probably knew then that he already had Logan's

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:05.020
characters perfectly formed, - humor and all.

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:08.210
Amazing Spider-Man
There's no limit to Emma Stone's charm, which

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.780
means that even when she accidentally calls
her superhero boyfriend by his REAL name the

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:13.780
cameras keep rolling.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.291
She was supposed to say Spider-Man, and her
reaction was completely genuine, but perfect

00:01:18.291 --> 00:01:19.580
for the character.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.260
Edge of Tomorrow
There isn't much time for romance when aliens

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.420
are slaughtering Tom Cruise day after day,
but when his co-star Emily Blunt decided that

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.100
forgetting her line, and just kissing him
instead felt like the right move for the scene,

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:35.700
he was left to react as best he could, with
the cut used in the finished movie

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.950
Top Gun
It isn't just Tom Cruise who GETS kissed without

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:38.950
warning, either.

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:39.950
The love scene from Top Gun became famous
before it left theaters, but it started by

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:40.950
accident.

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.600
When Cruise and his co-star Kelly McGillis
faced off on the street, he actually just

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.850
forgot his line, and kissed her instead - the
perfect way to get to love from hate.

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.790
Mr and Mrs Smith
Strange things happen when the same scene

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.290
is shot over, and over, and over again.

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.240
But when Angelina Jolie had the same Jeopardy
clip drilled into her brain, she couldn't

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.530
help but blurt out the answer in between her
lines.

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.130
And that's just the kind of random moment
directors can't help but include in the final

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:04.170
cut.

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.990
The Matrix
Keanu Reeves put in the work to master martial

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.789
arts for his role as The One, with Bruce Lee
an obvious idol.

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.800
So when the sparring session allowed he and
Lawrence Fishburne to loosen up, Reeves couldn't

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.740
help but throw in Lee's patented nose flick,
even though it wasn't in the script.

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.740
Pulp Fiction
When an actor like Samuel L. Jackson decides

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.920
to improvise, other actors just try to keep
up.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.460
After delivering his hamburger monologue in
his first Pulp Fiction scene, Jackson decided

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.110
to flip a table without warning the actor
sitting at it.

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.000
The move was brilliant, and audiences still
get to see the stunned, completely honest

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000
reactions.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.310
Fast &amp; Furious
Brian O'Conner got a rough welcome to Dominic

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.270
Toretto's gang, first tangling with his friend
Vince over Dom's sister Mia.

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:48.040
After some rough fight choreography didn't
go as expected, director Rob Cohen told the

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.010
actors to just... well, fight.

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.590
What you see in the film is a completely improvised
street fight - and it shows.

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.830
Guardians of the Galaxy
The first fans saw of Marvel's Guardians of

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.200
the Galaxy was the criminals' arrest and line-up,
and the scenes summed up each character pretty

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.200
well.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.400
It was Star-Lord's finger cranking that got
the biggest laugh, and was thought up by Pratt

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.990
completely on the spot.

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:13.490
Director James Gunn told him to add an apology,
and the bit was complete.

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:16.020
Speed
It's still hard to imagine Keanu Reeve's jump

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:20.350
from Bill and Ted to a certified action star
in Speed, and director Jan de Bont knew that

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.740
audiences might not realize the movie's hero
was as smart as he was.

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:27.490
Needing to show that Officer Jack Traven was
thinking through as problem, a pack of gum

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:28.630
became the answer.

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.550
Chewing means thinking after all - and it
actually worked.

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:34.670
End of Watch
Nothing shows a vulnerable side to a character

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.880
like singing in their car, and in End of Watch,
audiences got to see Jake Gyllenhaal and Anna

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.540
Kendrick's characters make a duet of Camron's
"Hey Ma."

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.460
But it actually wasn't their characters.

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:47.160
Director David Ayer was in the backseat preparing
to shoot written scenes for the pair, when

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.930
they shared the song while getting to know
eachother - with his camera rolling the whole

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:51.930
time.

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.489
Titanic
James Cameron knew he had one-of-a-kind stars,

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:59.260
and encouraged Kate Winslet and Leo DiCaprio
to improvise a few times in the film.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.510
The best came when he told Winslet not to
throw a hairpin at actor Billy Zane as planned,

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.030
but spit right into his face.

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.770
She did it, and Zane's very real reaction
can be seen in the film.

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:11.330
Ghostbusters
There were plenty of comedy legends to choose

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:16.060
from in the first Ghostbusters, but it's Rick
Moranis who comes away as the most underrated.

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.359
As the incredibly weird neighbor Louis, the
rambling lines and monologue given while hosting

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:24.530
a party in his apartment was almost completely
improvised, moment by moment.

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:27.840
This is The End
The minds behind the movie claim that almost

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.990
the entire shoot was improvised, and it shows.

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.470
But the improv didn't actually need much to
get off the ground.

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:36.780
The scene involving the gang getting into
a heated argument over a single Milky Way

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.730
bar is 100% unscripted.

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:42.530
Batman
No portrayal will likely match Jack Nicholson's

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:46.010
version of the Joker - a villain so weird,
you can't help but love him.

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:49.820
Most of his lines were in the script, but
Nicholson has admitted that his strange raspberry

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:54.540
blow, flying bird exit from Vicki Vale's apartment
was complete improv, making us wonder where

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.270
the script ended, and the real Joker began.

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.630
Gladiator
It's hard to forget the opening battle of

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:03.880
Ridley Scott's Roman epic, but both he and
star Russell Crowe knew that a quieter moment

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.220
for Maximus was needed before the action started.

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.320
The problem was, none had been written.

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:12.070
While trying to come up with a solution, a
bird decided to hop its way through the set.

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:16.860
So Scott rolled the cameras, Crowe gave his
reactions, and the rest is history.

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.430
The Lion King
It isn't just live-action actors who get to

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:20.430
improvise, either.

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:24.511
When the time comes for Timon to cause a distraction
to help Simba return to Pride Rock, actor

00:05:24.511 --> 00:05:30.250
Nathan Lane decided to add a joke suggestion
of his own It turned out that was a better

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:35.900
idea than what had actually been planned,
meaning Timon wound up doing exactly that.

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.070
Alien
Ridley Scott wasn't afraid to use tough love

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:42.120
in getting the best from Sigourney Weaver,
making sure her co-stars really did slap her

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.410
instead of faking it.

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:47.750
But to truly put her on edge, he instructed
actor Yaphet Kotto to interrupt all of her

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:48.750
lines.

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:52.800
By the scene following Dallas' death, she'd
had enough, telling her co- star, not the

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:53.830
character to "SHUT UP!"

00:05:53.830 --> 00:06:01.850
The Dark Knight Rises
The villain Bane may have been terrifying,

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:06.440
but you can't say he didn't have a sense of
humor - or a softer side But Bane's description

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:10.330
of the young boy singing the national anthem
at a Gotham football game was actually actor

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:14.449
Tom Hardy's, improvised on the spot.

00:06:14.449 --> 00:06:16.400
Conclusion
Those are some of our favorite improvised

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.760
or unscripted moments in classic movies, but
which ones have we missed?
