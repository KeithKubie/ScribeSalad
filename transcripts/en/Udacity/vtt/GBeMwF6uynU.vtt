You can use Analytics to get other
kinds of data, not just screen views.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:07.770
I'll quickly show you
the kinds of data you can get,

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.990
and then you'll try it out for yourself.

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.000
You can add code to your app to
find out what your users are doing

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.340
by sending data to Analytics to track
events, like when a button is clicked.

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:21.910
Or if you're building a game,

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:27.100
say, you could send an event
when a user unlocks a new level.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.333
Here's an example of the event
screen in the Analytics dashboard.

00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:34.420
So you see the category of the event,
and you see the actions.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.520
You can find out if your users
are doing what you hoped they'll do

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:38.810
by setting goals.

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:43.750
For example, you might set a goal for
the users to click the Buy Now button,

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.020
or click on an ad, or
reach a certain page.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.810
So here you see that one of the goals
is for the users to rate the app.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.180
So you can track how users browse and
buy.

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.762
If your app let's users view products and
buy them,

00:01:00.762 --> 00:01:04.272
you can track how the customers
progress through the shopping flow.

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.960
You can see which products get purchased
in the product performance page.

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.390
And you can track the steps throughout
the purchase and checkout process.

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:33.550
To track the way users view and

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:38.490
buy things, your app needs to have
the structure and code in place.

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.280
For users to browse products,
add them to the cart, checkout.

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.160
And then to get the Analytics data,

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:51.170
you need to add code to send a hit to
Analytics at each stage of the process.

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.740
You can also track how long it takes for
things to happen in your app.

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.890
You need to write the code to time
the task that needs to be timed.

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.854
And then you add the code to send the
hit to Analytics to report the timing

00:02:05.854 --> 00:02:06.361
data.

00:02:06.361 --> 00:02:10.770
And you see the timing info in the App
Speed page in the Behavior section

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:11.980
in the dashboard.

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.460
And you can track when things go wrong.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.370
You can send data to Analytics when
your app throws an exception or,

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.160
in the hopefully unlikely event,
has a crash.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.520
So here are examples of
a couple different exceptions.

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.060
You can also track how
users download your app.

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.500
In this course we're not going to
put our app on the Play Store, so

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.380
I'll leave you to explore how to track
down those sources in your own time

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.250
with an app that you've
published to the Play Store.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.960
So that was a roundup of the kinds of
things you can track with Analytics.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.030
Now, let's go do some tracking.
