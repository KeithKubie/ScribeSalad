KEVIN MCDONAGH:
I'm Kevin Mcdonogh.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.350
I'm CEO at Novoda.

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:15.250
And Novoda are the world's most
ambitious product engineers.

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:18.220
This means that we understand
product holistically

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.590
through our expertise
in engineering.

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.070
We work closely with our clients
to build cutting-edge apps that

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:25.900
drive their business goals.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.090
RYAN BATEMAN: I'm the
head of product at Novoda.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.300
We focus on building really
high quality products,

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.758
and we're really excited to
work with the Google Developers

00:00:32.758 --> 00:00:33.430
Agency Program.

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.138
KEVIN MCDONAGH: We're
one of the very few

00:00:35.138 --> 00:00:36.915
Google-certified
agencies in the world.

00:00:36.915 --> 00:00:39.040
This means that we have an
established relationship

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.530
with Google, and have met
that demanding criteria

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:42.970
for the certification.

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:44.830
For one, it gives
us early access

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:47.914
to tools that mean we can
build better, smarter apps

00:00:47.914 --> 00:00:48.580
for our clients.

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:50.350
RYAN BATEMAN: And we are
really excited to be involved,

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.975
as we knew it would give us new
tools to help make our client's

00:00:52.975 --> 00:00:54.470
product even better.

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.335
One of these products
was CCleaner.

00:00:56.335 --> 00:00:58.960
KEVIN MCDONAGH: Piriform, one of
the companies behind CCleaner,

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.420
they knew that we
could understand

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.340
their technically-focused users
and help them make this product

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:04.800
super successful on Android.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.542
RYAN BATEMAN: CCleaner
is a utility app.

00:01:06.542 --> 00:01:09.000
It's designed to keep your
phone in a more high performance

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.090
state.

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.090
For example, by getting rid of
old files you no longer need.

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:14.411
It also informs the user.

00:01:14.411 --> 00:01:16.410
By giving them more
information about the phone,

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.820
they can actually make better
choices around how they use it.

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.320
NEIL HUTCHINSON:
CCleaner on Android

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.990
is now a huge success with
more than 50 million downloads

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:24.880
on the platform
since its launch.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.590
As it's grown, it's
expanded to reach

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.029
types of users we hadn't
originally considered.

00:01:29.029 --> 00:01:31.070
Users who want to keep
the phone working well but

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.280
aren't interested
in technical detail.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.700
QI QU: We were faced with design
new features easily understood

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.940
by the average users
but with enough depth

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.322
to still appeal to the
app's core technical users.

00:01:42.322 --> 00:01:44.530
NEIL HUTCHINSON: The Google
Developers Agency Program

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.720
meant that we had early
access to the new Firebase

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.640
Analytics and remote config.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.620
This helped us to set
up effective A/B tests

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.080
to better understand
our user base,

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.030
how different
segments use the app,

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.230
and where we could
better improve each one.

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:57.730
QI QU: It also
means we can begin

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:01.660
to validate alternative designs
with our real existing user

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:02.710
base.

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.570
We now have a way
to really understand

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.060
what impact any
changes we make we have

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.621
before we roll them out to all
50 million of the app users.

00:02:10.621 --> 00:02:12.370
RYAN BATEMAN: The
developer agency program

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.950
has given us tools and knowledge
to make better products,

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.690
and we want to share that
knowledge with others.

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.980
We've also begun creating
a smart TV platform backed

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.080
by Firebase called Ten Foot TV.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.330
We're really excited to see
its functionality extended

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:26.482
to big screen devices.

00:02:26.482 --> 00:02:28.690
KEVIN MCDONAGH: Thanks to
the Google Developer Agency

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.850
Program, we've been
able to make CCleaner

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.430
a better, smarter
product for our clients

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.200
and its millions of users.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.810
We're really excited to continue
to be part of the program.

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.310
And we're looking
forward to working

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.980
with Google and our
clients to bring even more

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.670
fantastic products to market.
