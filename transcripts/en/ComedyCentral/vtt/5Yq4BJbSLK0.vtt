00:00:49.215 --> 00:00:53.586
- So my father was
an illegal falconer.

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.192
Anybody else?
Is there anybody else in here?

00:00:59.225 --> 00:01:00.960
All right, if you guys don't
know what falconry is,

00:01:00.993 --> 00:01:02.462
here it is.

00:01:02.495 --> 00:01:04.464
So it's been around for
a couple thousand years,

00:01:04.497 --> 00:01:06.732
and it's basically people, they
kidnap falcons out of the wild,

00:01:06.765 --> 00:01:09.936
and then they train them to
hunt for them.

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:12.472
Now, the popularity fizzled out

00:01:12.505 --> 00:01:15.408
with the invention
of the supermarket.

00:01:15.441 --> 00:01:17.076
People were like, "Hey man,
I don't know if we need

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:18.744
a bird of prey to bring us
our super anymore."

00:01:18.777 --> 00:01:20.780
We can just go to the meat
aisle at the grocery store."

00:01:20.813 --> 00:01:24.317
But a group of lunatics kept
this tradition alive,

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.319
and my father was one of them.

00:01:26.352 --> 00:01:29.622
Now here's the thing: You can
legally do falconry,

00:01:29.655 --> 00:01:30.990
but you need a license.

00:01:31.023 --> 00:01:32.959
And in order to get a license,

00:01:32.992 --> 00:01:34.594
you got to jump through
a few hoops.

00:01:34.627 --> 00:01:37.897
Number one, you have got to do
a two-year apprenticeship

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.732
with a master falconer.

00:01:39.765 --> 00:01:43.669
Now, of all the people that
I could spend two years with,

00:01:43.702 --> 00:01:47.607
I think master falconer is
probably at the bottom of that.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.576
After that, you have to build
an enclosure for this falcon

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:51.978
to live in.

00:01:52.011 --> 00:01:53.779
Then you need to take
a written test.

00:01:53.812 --> 00:01:55.448
Well, my dad's like, fuck that.
Okay?

00:01:55.481 --> 00:01:57.617
I'm not gonna let
the government tell me

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.485
what I can and can't do.

00:01:59.518 --> 00:02:02.121
And so he gets a book
on falconry

00:02:02.154 --> 00:02:04.190
and he reads about
three chapters into it,

00:02:04.223 --> 00:02:07.460
and then he comes home
with a baby falcon.

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:12.532
To this day, I have no idea

00:02:12.565 --> 00:02:14.800
where he actually got this
falcon from.

00:02:14.833 --> 00:02:19.805
He claims he found it while he
was hiking through the woods.

00:02:19.838 --> 00:02:22.675
Now, I've done a lot of hiking
in the woods,

00:02:22.708 --> 00:02:26.012
and I have never seen a baby
falcon just laying there

00:02:26.045 --> 00:02:28.114
looking for a good home.

00:02:28.147 --> 00:02:30.316
And it seemed like
an odd coincidence

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:33.119
that he just happened to be
reading a book on falconry

00:02:33.152 --> 00:02:34.787
and he finds a falcon.

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.289
Either way, he brings it home.

00:02:36.322 --> 00:02:37.390
But he doesn't have
an enclosure.

00:02:37.423 --> 00:02:38.958
He didn't build an enclosure.

00:02:38.991 --> 00:02:40.793
So here's what he does.

00:02:40.826 --> 00:02:43.896
He reassembles an old dog crate
we have in our living room,

00:02:43.929 --> 00:02:45.998
and he throws it in there.

00:02:46.031 --> 00:02:48.467
Now, I have to admit, as a kid,
we have a pet falcon,

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:49.669
it's kind of cool, all right.

00:02:49.702 --> 00:02:50.836
I had a friend come over,

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:52.338
he's like, "Hey, I just got
a new dog."

00:02:52.371 --> 00:02:53.706
And I was like,
"I see your dog,

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:57.343
and I raise you a fucking
falcon, my friend.

00:02:57.376 --> 00:03:00.046
Get that dog shit out of here."

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:01.347
But then something happens.

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:02.682
About six, seven months goes
by,

00:03:02.715 --> 00:03:05.484
and this thing grows up,
and it is now

00:03:05.517 --> 00:03:07.320
a full blown bird of prey.

00:03:07.353 --> 00:03:09.922
And I'll tell you this: It does
not want to go back

00:03:09.955 --> 00:03:11.924
in the dog crate anymore.

00:03:11.957 --> 00:03:13.659
So here's what my dad does.

00:03:13.692 --> 00:03:17.530
He lets it fly around
our house,

00:03:17.563 --> 00:03:20.700
so right off the bat we let
our cats out one day

00:03:20.733 --> 00:03:22.168
and they're like,
"We're out of here.

00:03:22.201 --> 00:03:23.869
Like, fuck you guys,
we're out."

00:03:23.902 --> 00:03:26.539
One of 'em I think had, like,
a stick with a handkerchief

00:03:26.572 --> 00:03:28.774
with his shit filled on it
hobo style and just...

00:03:28.807 --> 00:03:32.445
Our dog all day long just hides
under the desk, okay?

00:03:32.478 --> 00:03:36.215
He's traumatized.
He's got PTSD.

00:03:36.248 --> 00:03:37.917
But here's the worst part.

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.754
So this falcon loved to perch
itself on our refrigerator,

00:03:41.787 --> 00:03:43.389
right on the freezer door,

00:03:43.422 --> 00:03:47.059
so literally every time I went
to go get a Klondike bar,

00:03:47.092 --> 00:03:52.198
I had to ask myself, what would
you do for this Klondike bar?

00:03:52.231 --> 00:03:55.067
Like, is it worth getting
a talon in your nut sack

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:59.071
for that delicious
vanilla ice cream,

00:03:59.104 --> 00:04:02.275
chocolate covered goodness?

00:04:02.308 --> 00:04:03.709
One of the scariest things is,

00:04:03.742 --> 00:04:05.645
when you would open
the freezer door,

00:04:05.678 --> 00:04:08.881
it would just swing open with
it and then just swing close.

00:04:08.914 --> 00:04:11.717
No change of expression on its
face whatsoever.

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.620
I don't know if it was thinking
of unicorns and rainbows,

00:04:14.653 --> 00:04:19.158
or thinking about mass murder
of my whole family.

00:04:19.191 --> 00:04:21.794
Now, once a day, my dad has
to take this thing outside

00:04:21.827 --> 00:04:24.764
in our backyard, but falcons
don't want to live

00:04:24.797 --> 00:04:27.166
in captivity, so here's what
you have to do

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:28.934
to keep them from flying away.

00:04:28.967 --> 00:04:32.338
You have to tie a string to
their leg, give it some slack,

00:04:32.371 --> 00:04:35.675
and then hold on to
the other end.

00:04:35.708 --> 00:04:37.243
By the way, my dad had
none of the falcon gear

00:04:37.276 --> 00:04:38.844
that was necessary.

00:04:38.877 --> 00:04:40.980
Like, you're supposed to have
a thick leather glove;

00:04:41.013 --> 00:04:42.114
he had an old oven mitt.

00:04:42.147 --> 00:04:43.816
That's what he would carry--

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:46.952
that's what he would carry it
out into the backyard with.

00:04:46.985 --> 00:04:49.622
So we'd hold the other end,
and he would let it go.

00:04:49.655 --> 00:04:53.125
And so it was basically like he
was flying a falcon kite

00:04:53.158 --> 00:04:56.262
in our backyard.

00:04:56.295 --> 00:04:58.464
And it probably wouldn't have
been a big deal,

00:04:58.497 --> 00:05:03.803
but at the time,
we lived in a motel.

00:05:03.836 --> 00:05:05.304
Yeah.

00:05:05.337 --> 00:05:06.939
So my parents thought it would
be a good idea

00:05:06.972 --> 00:05:09.141
to buy a motel and then we
would live in an apartment

00:05:09.174 --> 00:05:10.643
attached to it.

00:05:10.676 --> 00:05:12.945
So every day my dad's flying
this thing around,

00:05:12.978 --> 00:05:15.948
and everybody in all the rooms
are staring out,

00:05:15.981 --> 00:05:19.552
being like, is that guy flying
a fucking falcon?

00:05:22.988 --> 00:05:25.057
And now word's traveling
through our small town

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:27.493
in Indiana, that once a day you
can watch a guy

00:05:27.526 --> 00:05:30.629
fly a falcon behind our motel.

00:05:30.662 --> 00:05:32.865
And so now we're scared that
something's gonna happen,

00:05:32.898 --> 00:05:34.500
because here's the thing:

00:05:34.533 --> 00:05:36.202
Illegal falconry,
if you get busted for it,

00:05:36.235 --> 00:05:37.503
it's not a slap on the wrist.

00:05:37.536 --> 00:05:39.472
It's two years in prison

00:05:39.505 --> 00:05:42.475
and a $50,000 fine.

00:05:42.508 --> 00:05:43.876
That's insane, right?

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:46.412
You can kill a man and get less
than that.

00:05:46.445 --> 00:05:48.314
I didn't know illegal falconry
was like that big

00:05:48.347 --> 00:05:52.051
of a problem where they need to
levy these sorts of penalties.

00:05:52.084 --> 00:05:53.686
So now we're freaking out.

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:55.588
We're like, "Holy shit,
if he goes to jail,

00:05:55.621 --> 00:05:57.189
there's not a lot of
street cred that comes

00:05:57.222 --> 00:05:59.859
with illegal falconry when you
get to the big house."

00:05:59.892 --> 00:06:02.528
Like, not a lot of dudes are
like, don't rape that guy;

00:06:02.561 --> 00:06:06.098
illegal falconer.
He'll fuck you up.

00:06:06.131 --> 00:06:07.366
So then something happens.

00:06:07.399 --> 00:06:09.368
So, a little twist of fate
happens.

00:06:09.401 --> 00:06:13.205
So my dad every day, he would
feed this thing a live mouse.

00:06:13.238 --> 00:06:15.674
So he goes to the pet shop,
he gets a live mouse,

00:06:15.707 --> 00:06:17.543
puts it on the living room
floor,

00:06:17.576 --> 00:06:21.013
and then the falcon flies off
the top of the dog crate,

00:06:21.046 --> 00:06:24.083
swoops down and murders
the mouse in front of me

00:06:24.116 --> 00:06:27.119
while I'm trying to watch
"Dukes of Hazzard."

00:06:27.152 --> 00:06:29.722
Just rips its insides out.

00:06:29.755 --> 00:06:32.458
So then one day my dad goes
to the pet shop

00:06:32.491 --> 00:06:34.460
and he tried to buy a mouse.

00:06:34.493 --> 00:06:36.228
They're all out of mice.
I don't know what happened.

00:06:36.261 --> 00:06:37.897
Snake convention in town,
I don't know

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:41.133
how a pet shop runs out
of mice.

00:06:41.166 --> 00:06:42.935
So here's what he does.
He has a backup plan.

00:06:42.968 --> 00:06:45.471
He has some pork that's thawing
out in his refrigerator,

00:06:45.504 --> 00:06:48.541
so he feeds the falcon
some pork.

00:06:48.574 --> 00:06:51.277
The falcon eats it,
next morning we wake up,

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:54.613
the falcon's dead.
Yeah.

00:06:54.646 --> 00:06:56.415
I don't know.
I think they're Muslim

00:06:56.448 --> 00:06:57.817
or something.

00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:59.952
I don't know the exact science
behind it.

00:06:59.985 --> 00:07:01.487
I don't know.

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.255
So then my dead reads, like,
three chapters ahead

00:07:03.288 --> 00:07:06.559
and he goes, "Oh, shit, you're
not supposed to feed 'em pork."

00:07:06.592 --> 00:07:08.294
So now we have this dead
falcon,

00:07:08.327 --> 00:07:09.995
which I got to be honest
with you,

00:07:10.028 --> 00:07:12.164
if you're getting two years for
just having a live falcon,

00:07:12.197 --> 00:07:15.468
if you murder one, it's
probably way more than that.

00:07:15.501 --> 00:07:17.770
So now we have to wait for
nightfall to come.

00:07:17.803 --> 00:07:19.472
We march out into the woods,

00:07:19.505 --> 00:07:21.073
my brother and I dig a hole,

00:07:21.106 --> 00:07:22.808
we bury it like ten feet deep,

00:07:22.841 --> 00:07:26.612
and my dad was just so
brokenhearted about this.

00:07:26.645 --> 00:07:29.448
He was devastated.
He was devastated.

00:07:29.481 --> 00:07:31.116
He thought that he was
super tight with this

00:07:31.149 --> 00:07:32.618
fucking falcon.

00:07:32.651 --> 00:07:34.019
By the way, he was not tight
with this falcon at all.

00:07:34.052 --> 00:07:35.955
This falcon didn't give a shit
about him.

00:07:35.988 --> 00:07:38.691
But my dad, he never gave up,
man.

00:07:38.724 --> 00:07:41.460
He tried to get other falcons
unsuccessfully,

00:07:41.493 --> 00:07:43.128
and he passed away last year,

00:07:43.161 --> 00:07:47.633
which is why I'm legally
allowed to tell this story now.

00:07:47.666 --> 00:07:50.469
But one of the last
conversations I had with him

00:07:50.502 --> 00:07:53.606
was in his backyard,
and he was grilling,

00:07:53.639 --> 00:07:54.974
and there was a falcon

00:07:55.007 --> 00:07:56.942
that actually lived in his
neighborhood.

00:07:56.975 --> 00:08:00.012
And it was soaring overheard,
and he was looking up at it,

00:08:00.045 --> 00:08:02.815
and then he just turned to me
and he goes,

00:08:02.848 --> 00:08:06.719
"I'm gonna catch that
motherfucker."

00:08:06.752 --> 00:08:09.221
And then he died.
Thank you guys!

00:08:09.254 --> 00:08:10.823
Thank you very much.

00:08:10.856 --> 00:08:13.826
<i> - Ryan O'Neill, everybody.
 Ryan O'Neill!</i>

00:08:13.859 --> 00:08:16.062
<i> [cheers and applause]</i>
