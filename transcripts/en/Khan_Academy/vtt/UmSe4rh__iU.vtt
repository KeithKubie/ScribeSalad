00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:01.750
- [Voiceover] So I have a square here

00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:05.990
and let's say that its
height is one meter.

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:08.250
So this is height right over here.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.990
That is one meter.

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:13.290
And let's say its width is also one meter.

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.450
So I'm talking about the
dimensions of the entire square,

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.250
not just the shaded region.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.320
So this is also, that right
over there is also one meter.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.990
What's the area of the
entire square going to be,

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.490
not just the shaded, the entire square?

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.620
Well, the total area,

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:32.350
total area is going to be equal to

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:34.320
the height times the width.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.320
So one meter times one meter.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.920
One times one is of course one

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.450
and meters times meters

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:42.050
we could write that as a square meter

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.690
or meter squared, however
you want to think about it.

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.280
Now with that out of the way

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.150
now let's focus on the shaded area.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:50.790
Let's think about what that is.

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.090
So the shaded, shaded,

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.650
shaded area is equal to what,

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:58.010
and I encourage you to pause the video

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.450
and try to figure that out.

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:02.020
Well the one thing that
might jump out of you

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.690
is that our entire area, our entire square

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.050
is divided into these equally
equal, equal rectangles.

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:10.590
So one way to think about it is well,

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.720
what is the area of each
of these equal rectangles?

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.390
For example what is the area

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.710
of that rectangle right over there?

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:18.590
And to figure it out we can say

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.090
well, what fraction is that of the whole?

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.850
And to figure that out
we have to figure out

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.550
how many of these rectangles

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.230
has our whole been divided into?

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:29.420
We could try to count them out

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.570
or we could say let's see, I have

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.220
one, two, three, four, five,

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.650
six, seven, eight, nine, 10 columns,

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.890
and each columns has
one, two, three, four,

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.150
five, six, seven.

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.050
So we have 10 columns of seven

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.450
or we have 70 of these rectangles,

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.850
that our entire whole is
divided into 70 equal sections

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.770
that we see these
rectangles right over here.

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.650
This character, this
character right over there

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.220
that is 1/70 of the entire area.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.850
So 1/70 of one square meter

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.850
which is of course just going
to be 1/70 of a square meter.

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.920
That's just one of these.

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.020
That's just one of these rectangles.

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.410
Now if we cared about the shaded area

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.820
we can just count how many
of these rectangles there are

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:20.510
and we see that there are
one, two, three, four,

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.620
five, six, seven, eight, nine columns

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.220
of one, two, three.

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.320
So there's 27 of these rectangles,

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.550
of these equal rectangles
in the shaded area.

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.150
The shaded area is going to be,

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.150
we have 27 of these
rectangles and each of them,

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.250
and then each of them have an area

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.750
of 1/70 of a square meter.

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.250
1/70 of a square meter

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.650
and what does that give us?

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.920
Well that gives us the area of the shaded

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.550
or the shaded area is going to be 27/70.

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:58.820
27 times 1/70 is going to be 27/70.

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:03.820
27/70 square meters

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.320
and we're done.

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:06.520
But what I want to appreciate now

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:07.790
is that there's multiple ways

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:09.350
that we could have tackled this.

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.420
Another way we could have tackled it

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.120
is to figure out what the dimensions,

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.850
what the dimensions
are of the shaded area.

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:18.820
So for example.

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:23.050
For example, what is the height

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:24.920
of just the shaded area?

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.790
So just that height right over there

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:27.820
and I encourage you to pause the video

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:28.850
and try to think about what it is

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:30.840
and it's going to be a fraction.

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.420
Well, we see if we're going
in the vertical direction

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.720
we've divided this one meter.

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.550
We've divided it into one,
two, three, four, five.

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.150
So let me do it a little bit differently.

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.690
We've divided it into one, two,

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:52.220
three, four, five, six,

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.350
seven equal sections.

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:55.720
That might have been
a little bit confusing

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:56.820
the way I just drew it.

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.610
So you can see it when
you look at the actual...

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:01.370
Actually let me do it
in a more vibrant color.

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.290
We have...

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.420
I'm having trouble picking colors.

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:07.750
All right, here we go.

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.290
We have one, that's that right over there.

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:16.120
Two, three, four, five, six,

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.550
seven equal sections that we've
divided this one meter in.

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:24.010
And the height of the shaded
area is three of them.

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:26.250
So this height right over here,

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.450
this height right over
here is 3/7 of the whole

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:31.620
and the whole is a meter.

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.090
So it's 3/7 of a meter.

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.550
Now by that same logic what
is the width going to be?

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.950
What is the width going to be?

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:43.620
Well we can see that the entire meter

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.420
has been divided into one,
two, three, four, five,

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:50.720
six, seven, eight, nine, 10 equal sections

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.920
so going from here to here
is going to be a tenth.

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:57.220
So this distance right over
here is going to be a tenth.

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.320
Let me do that in a
color that's different.

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:04.090
So this distance right over
here is going to be a tenth

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:06.150
and so how many tenths represent

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.350
the width of the green area?

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:11.650
Let's see, we get, have 1/10, 2/10,

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:14.190
3/10, 4/10, 5/10,

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:17.720
6/10, 7/10, 8/10, 9/10.

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:21.720
So this width is 9/10 of this whole length

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:25.590
which is a meter so it's 9/10 of a meter.

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.350
Now to find the area

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:29.920
we can multiply the width times the height

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:31.650
or the height times the width.

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:34.620
So we could say, so I'll write this again.

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.390
The shaded area.

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:40.250
Shaded area instead of doing it this way

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:44.320
we could say I have a
height of 3/7 of a meter.

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:47.950
So 3/7 meters

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:50.250
and then I can multiply
that, times our width

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:51.620
for just the shaded area

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:53.650
which is 9/10 of a meter.

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:56.390
9/10 of a meter.

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:58.320
And now what is this going to get us?

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:59.950
Well, this is going to be equal to

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:01.450
the meters times the
meters is going to get

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:03.350
square meters which is what we want

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:04.720
and then we could multiple the numerators

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:06.350
and multiply the denominators.

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:10.750
Three times nine is going to give us 27

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:13.650
and seven times 10 is going to give us 70.

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:15.350
Exactly what we had before.

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:18.150
27/70 square.

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:19.390
Let me write that a little bit neater.

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:21.320
27.

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:25.090
27/70

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:27.390
of a square meter.

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:29.890
And you could think about
why did this work out

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:31.020
regardless of how we did it?

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:33.620
Notice, three and nine are the numerators.

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:36.650
That was how many rows and columns we had

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:38.750
of these little rectangles.

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:40.150
And then the seven and 10

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:43.490
that's to figure out how many
rectangles we actually had.

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:44.520
So this is saying okay,

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:47.620
the three times nine is how
many rectangles we have?

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:49.750
And then the seven times 10 is

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:51.120
what fraction of the whole

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.820
each of those rectangles represent

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:54.650
and that's essentially
what we did up here.

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:56.790
So either way, you're going
to get the right answer

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:59.800
but I really want you to
think about why this was.
