a terrible barrier right off the bat and

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360
a terrible barrier right off the bat and
 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.610
a terrible barrier right off the bat and
then of course you're putting your

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620
then of course you're putting your
 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.229
then of course you're putting your
family and friends at substantial

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239

really brilliant idea and so then let's

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190
really brilliant idea and so then let's
 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.160
