00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.370
Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burr and It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.510
Just before Friday.

3
00:00:06.511 --> 00:00:11.511
Monday morning podcast and ahhh,

4
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.120
just whisper head while check it and od Ya.

5
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:16.670
<v 0>Okay.</v>

6
00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.120
<v 1>It's like fucking seven 15 in the morning. My wife's downstairs still sleeping.</v>

7
00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:23.450
Um, you know what's hilarious?

8
00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:29.120
Fucking Versie texts me right at like six 10 in the morning.

9
00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.310
He goes, I was just at a great diner, ordered eggs over medium.

10
00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:39.560
They came eggs over easy and then rights. Unreal.

11
00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.520
So then I wrote back, I text back, right?

12
00:00:43.521 --> 00:00:45.800
I was laying in bed and my fucking phone goes off, right?

13
00:00:45.801 --> 00:00:49.130
So I wake up and that's what, that's what I read, right?

14
00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.280
So I just text him back and I go,

15
00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.140
they didn't care Paul. Right?

16
00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.500
And then he writes t techs back,

17
00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.340
how are you up at this hour animal?

18
00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:07.040
And then I text back, I go out,

19
00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.200
cause some guy on the east coast keeps texting me.

20
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.530
How come when you put your fucking phone on vibrate?

21
00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.740
I guess it's the vibrating sound. You think it's going to be silent.

22
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.630
I gotta find this. Then go into your settings. Oh fuck you.

23
00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.700
You know, my goal for 2016 is, is to just not go into my settings.

24
00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.580
What are they going to come up with? The fucking robot that does that for you,

25
00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.610
right? Just goes into your set. Why you don't want that?

26
00:01:34.611 --> 00:01:35.810
Then you lose total control.

27
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.150
That's like sign over power of attorney at least fucking dopes that I know for

28
00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.230
the guys and I'd have a a money manager and you know,

29
00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.340
I haven't paid a bill in years and they just have some guy writing checks on

30
00:01:49.341 --> 00:01:52.490
their account, signing their fucking name or there you go.

31
00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.220
Is a good move financially, what could you do?

32
00:01:55.221 --> 00:01:57.380
Want to lick a stamp a couple of times a week,

33
00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.930
you're going to just hand over all your finances.

34
00:01:59.931 --> 00:02:03.740
Everything you ever fucking work for to some fucking jerk off,

35
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.570
can't do that shit. You can not do that.

36
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.300
Anytime you're in a position of a money manager,

37
00:02:12.301 --> 00:02:14.040
you cannot do it because there's no way.

38
00:02:14.041 --> 00:02:17.460
You're not making more money than that fucking guy. If he was,

39
00:02:17.461 --> 00:02:19.800
he'd have his own money manager, right?

40
00:02:19.801 --> 00:02:22.350
So all he's gonna do is see you making more money than him.

41
00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.640
And then he's handling all the money that eventually he's going to be like,

42
00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.490
yeah, you know your, I think I'm entitled to more.

43
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.680
Maybe I'm going to go to McDonald's today on his dime.

44
00:02:33.681 --> 00:02:37.880
And he writes a check [inaudible] for four bucks, right?

45
00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.830
Eight fucking chows down any weights.

46
00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.700
See if just guy pays attention. See if you fucking notices

47
00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.840
that $4 checked in McDonald's was written this month,

48
00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.120
that then stay waited another month. Played safe place safe. I mean,

49
00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.520
but fucking with jail time here, play it safe, right? You go two, three months.

50
00:02:57.521 --> 00:03:01.420
He doesn't fucking notice I gay. My kid's got a birthday coming up.

51
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.570
Let's see if I dip it in. I go to fucking toys r us.

52
00:03:04.571 --> 00:03:06.580
Let's see if you notice this. Let's see if he notices.

53
00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.270
I'd go down there and get the fucking Millennium Falcon and all this star wars

54
00:03:10.271 --> 00:03:14.690
shit for my son and for my daughter. I'll get her the fucking kitty, Kerry.

55
00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.920
I'll fucking easy bake a whatever the fuck you get upright, right?

56
00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.080
A little bright LP, right?

57
00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.190
Not Linda did by talking a little broad here, right?

58
00:03:24.191 --> 00:03:27.310
So you fucking go down and you do that, right? There's fucking Wa whatever,

59
00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:32.620
150 bucks over the count does. He notice, doesn't fucking notice, right.

60
00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:36.580
Does Not fucking notice. And then you know you to Spec it.

61
00:03:36.581 --> 00:03:40.360
It just keeps opening and opening and then the guy can't stop,

62
00:03:40.361 --> 00:03:43.390
can't fucking stop himself. He's taken so much fucking money.

63
00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.060
He starts donating some of it to charity.

64
00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:50.920
He's fucking taking his friends out and don't worry, it's on me, right?

65
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.450
That's all the guilt.

66
00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:58.480
He knows it's coming as he sits between his 2000 thread count fucking sheets at

67
00:03:58.481 --> 00:03:58.691
night,

68
00:03:58.691 --> 00:04:01.930
he's just laying there knowing at some point that door is going to be kicked in.

69
00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.880
You know, he's just going to hear out the door and then he's going to be like,

70
00:04:06.881 --> 00:04:10.450
did I just dream that? Boom, it's going to come open there.

71
00:04:10.451 --> 00:04:14.860
He's going to bake like Jerry London Garden fucking a

72
00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.980
and Fargo trying to go out that bathroom window and that it is going to grab him

73
00:04:20.981 --> 00:04:25.900
as he goes, Eh, Eh, faced out on the fucking bed,

74
00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:29.650
right? And natives, what's going to happen? All right. They'd get them.

75
00:04:29.651 --> 00:04:31.630
And they'd go to jail and then what the fuck are you going to do?

76
00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:33.190
And then you got to take this car to court.

77
00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.740
He's already blown all the fucking cash.

78
00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:38.560
Or you know what she could do?

79
00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.970
You could make out a check to the fucking gas company every fucking month.

80
00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.600
He could do that. You know, you could sit down in front of the TV, you know,

81
00:04:46.601 --> 00:04:47.890
watching a little bit of the news.

82
00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.680
She could do that and just not open yourself up to that shit. I mean,

83
00:04:50.681 --> 00:04:55.630
that's what she could do. Oh, I'm on my fucking stump today.

84
00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.500
I just yelled, my wife's going to give me shit. But you know,

85
00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:00.790
when you're in a relationship,

86
00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:05.200
there's ups and downs in the relationships and there's times when you give a

87
00:05:05.201 --> 00:05:08.530
shit what that person thinks about you. And then there's times when you don't.

88
00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.970
Seven in the morning on a Thursday when I'm a little grumpy,

89
00:05:12.971 --> 00:05:15.520
I don't give a fuck. She'll be mad through breakfast.

90
00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:20.230
I just don't understand why you have to yell that early in the morning.

91
00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.070
I don't understand. I know you don't understand.

92
00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.760
I know all day long. You don't understand.

93
00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.800
She a fucking Goddamn ammo. That's the lady's emo.

94
00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:37.660
I don't understand why you don't just do everything that I want at the moment

95
00:05:37.661 --> 00:05:39.160
that I want you to do it.

96
00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:43.570
I don't understand that I live with somebody else that has a different schedule

97
00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:48.730
than I do. I don't understand. Um,

98
00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:54.250
anyways, Jesus Christ. I uh, you know,

99
00:05:54.251 --> 00:05:58.040
I've watched the last three Celtic games in a row believer in and not,

100
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.470
<v 2>I can't remember the last time I watched three Celtic games,</v>

101
00:06:00.471 --> 00:06:03.350
regular season games in a row.

102
00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:08.480
Not even when we bought the NBA title in 2007,

103
00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.990
2008, whatever the fuck it was right that season.

104
00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.690
I never watched three games in a row. I just didn't,

105
00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:19.140
I hadn't watched them and fucking ever, I was totally turned off by the NBA.

106
00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:23.360
I was convinced that it was fixed. I said it for years. I said, at this game,

107
00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:25.220
the fucking league is fixed.

108
00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:30.790
And then they ended up finding a ref that was fixing games that fuck the

109
00:06:30.831 --> 00:06:33.410
Sacramento Kings out of a playoff series,

110
00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:38.090
the western conference finals, if I remember correctly.

111
00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:41.780
And the Lakers went on to the finals and won a championship.

112
00:06:41.781 --> 00:06:44.060
That guy is admitted that he fixed that series.

113
00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:47.750
The Lakers still have that banner right now, and I didn't give a shit.

114
00:06:47.751 --> 00:06:50.120
I was sitting there, I felt vindicated going, hey look,

115
00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:51.140
this is what I've been saying.

116
00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:53.900
I told you it was fixed and you know what these hoop had said to me.

117
00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:56.750
That's right. I call them who? Peds. You know what they said? They got all,

118
00:06:56.751 --> 00:06:59.960
it's just one guy. It's just one fucking guy.

119
00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:05.780
Hilarious. Fucking hilarious. You know what I mean?

120
00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:10.520
I'd love to see a guy do that on like the view or the talk one of those shows,

121
00:07:10.521 --> 00:07:12.020
you know with all the lady sitting there,

122
00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:15.950
when they bring up domestic violence going over fucking blah, blah, blah.

123
00:07:15.951 --> 00:07:18.500
Women are beaten every year. Just be like, why? And I was just like, you know,

124
00:07:18.501 --> 00:07:19.880
it's like 6% of guys,

125
00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:24.140
other 94% of us are crushing it.

126
00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:30.580
<v 1>As far as not hitting women. I'd love to see you do that. You know what?</v>

127
00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:34.690
You be called? A fucking sexist. A goddamn animal. It would probably,

128
00:07:34.691 --> 00:07:37.540
if they could affect your bottom line.

129
00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:42.160
Cause it's never ed about educating people when they make ignorant statements,

130
00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:46.540
it's about destroying their ability to earn a living,

131
00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:49.180
which is great. You know what I mean?

132
00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:53.050
Cause I'm sure that helps that person's hateful heart, you know,

133
00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:55.750
to have the group that they have an issue with,

134
00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:59.140
take away his paycheck every fuck at wake or her paycheck,

135
00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:01.480
then I'm sure they go, oh now I get it.

136
00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:05.310
Now I guess I should be less racist. You know like they,

137
00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:08.860
they do that when someone gets busted for being a racist. Right.

138
00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:11.650
They get busted for fucking being a racist. Right.

139
00:08:11.651 --> 00:08:13.420
And rather than trying to educate them,

140
00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:17.540
they just kick them out on the fucking street. What does,

141
00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:19.840
I'm not saying you'd all hold somebody accountable.

142
00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:21.850
I'm not saying you don't sit down and tell.

143
00:08:21.851 --> 00:08:23.500
You should try to fucking educate them.

144
00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:26.860
I guess there's gotta be some sort of a fine though, right?

145
00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:30.700
Get a couple of weeks suspension. I don't know.

146
00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:33.820
How do you really change in a racist?

147
00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:38.290
<v 2>I don't know you. I make, well you know what,</v>

148
00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:41.200
<v 1>white guys can't jump, but they make those little things that, you know,</v>

149
00:08:41.201 --> 00:08:45.050
they stick on the bottom of your sneakers to give you the quick twitch lease.

150
00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:48.820
They showed that on the back of the, you know, the comic books.

151
00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:50.920
Maybe they could make that for like racist people,

152
00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:55.980
<v 2>you know, a better yet. You know, not better yet, but</v>

153
00:08:55.980 --> 00:09:00.240
<v 1>I have alleged we switch it up public. How about nags? You know,</v>

154
00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:05.260
if you with somebody who's just a whiner or they nag a,

155
00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:07.050
that just a fucking pain in the ass.

156
00:09:07.051 --> 00:09:09.330
It's just something you can put on the bottom. This shoe,

157
00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:13.490
give him a little spring in this step, you know, get the endorphins movement.

158
00:09:13.491 --> 00:09:16.590
You know what I mean? Get him to walk around the block.

159
00:09:16.591 --> 00:09:20.670
Maybe see a couple of butterflies, you know, chill the fuck out.

160
00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:22.500
Maybe you could do that. I have no idea.

161
00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:28.260
Do you see those two surfers in Australia invented that thing that can vacuum up

162
00:09:28.261 --> 00:09:31.230
the ocean? It really can't,

163
00:09:31.231 --> 00:09:33.780
but it can get rid of a lot of litter.

164
00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:37.200
I don't know how many you'd need to fucking end the swirl.

165
00:09:37.201 --> 00:09:39.570
We got going out there in the fucking Pacific Ocean.

166
00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:43.920
But it was a really cool idea and it was um, I have a dental,

167
00:09:43.921 --> 00:09:46.710
he safe murmur for marine life and all of that type of shit.

168
00:09:46.711 --> 00:09:51.180
And it actually gave me hope for our ability to, uh,

169
00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:54.330
continue being here for any sort of foreseeable future.

170
00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:57.150
And then I was just like, you know, what's going to happen?

171
00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:00.270
Is there a,

172
00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:05.390
the game that they're going to have to play to get that thing to a national

173
00:10:08.881 --> 00:10:09.870
fucking level,

174
00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:14.280
international level that everybody would actually use it,

175
00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:19.370
the sea of corporate and political red tape that you would have to go through

176
00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:23.250
and the amount of ownership that you're going to have to give up,

177
00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:25.530
probably 100%,

178
00:10:27.970 --> 00:10:28.803
<v 3>um,</v>

179
00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:31.250
<v 1>to actually make that fucking thing happen</v>

180
00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:37.780
is probably the chances of them actually using that fucking thing is probably

181
00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:43.580
zero fucking percent. That's what's going to fucking happen.

182
00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:47.430
You know what I mean? Hey, is it thing that could possibly solve the problem?

183
00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:48.531
Where's the thing? You know, it's funny,

184
00:10:48.531 --> 00:10:52.490
as you vacuum up the fucking litter out of the ocean and then where do you put

185
00:10:52.491 --> 00:10:53.324
it?

186
00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:55.433
<v 3>You know?</v>

187
00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:01.670
<v 1>Well, yeah. Then you put it in the ground and what about the worms?</v>

188
00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:04.220
Then the birds can eat it than the cats have nothing to eat.

189
00:11:04.221 --> 00:11:06.860
That dogs have nothing to chase. You know,

190
00:11:06.861 --> 00:11:09.410
certain groups of people have nothing to eat right.

191
00:11:09.411 --> 00:11:12.970
Then we have nobody to fight. Eh, then fuck it. A,

192
00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:16.330
our military goes down the jail. It's a fucking, it's a, it's a,

193
00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:21.200
it's a slippery slope. You start vacuum up the ocean. You know,

194
00:11:21.201 --> 00:11:22.460
I was thinking the other day, you know,

195
00:11:22.461 --> 00:11:27.461
when the world population got out of control is when Shit couldn't be made out

196
00:11:29.301 --> 00:11:32.600
of natural shit anymore. You know,

197
00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:34.370
like if you look at kids' toys

198
00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:37.880
and back in like the forties and fifties,

199
00:11:37.881 --> 00:11:42.200
if you go on Ebay and look at those creepy fucking toys played by now,

200
00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:43.610
dead kids,

201
00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:54.490
kids that are now grown up, gotten divorce you. Oh Jesus,

202
00:11:54.491 --> 00:11:56.740
I the fucking clouds hanging over me today.

203
00:11:57.210 --> 00:12:00.100
This is what happens if somebody texted me before I want to fucking wake up.

204
00:12:00.101 --> 00:12:02.770
I'm grumpy back then.

205
00:12:02.771 --> 00:12:06.700
If you look at those creepy as fucking toys that looks slightly haunted,

206
00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:11.830
you know what I mean? They made out of wood, metal, the cars,

207
00:12:11.831 --> 00:12:16.780
even like the tires who made out of rubber, there was all all natural shit.

208
00:12:16.781 --> 00:12:20.320
So at the end of the day, if you fucking threw those things out,

209
00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:23.740
even if you throw them into the fucking ocean, they don't belong in there.

210
00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:26.740
The end of the day, what do you got? You got a little bit of metal,

211
00:12:26.890 --> 00:12:31.690
a little bit of wood, right? It's going to break down.

212
00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:36.280
It's going to be fine. I'm not seeing the throat fucking, you know,

213
00:12:36.281 --> 00:12:39.030
old dead kids toys into the ocean. That's not what I'm saying. Yeah,

214
00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:39.881
but I'm saying or whatever.

215
00:12:39.881 --> 00:12:44.710
You take it down to the dump and all of that Shit's going to biodegrade. Right?

216
00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:50.350
It was, you know, once we went into the plastics, fuck it over,

217
00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:53.410
cause there was so many goddamn whining kids,

218
00:12:53.411 --> 00:12:56.440
they had more whining kids than they had fucking trees and rubber.

219
00:12:57.220 --> 00:12:59.470
That comes from my tree, right? Jess?

220
00:12:59.471 --> 00:13:04.471
What makes that little lowland Danky can climb that rubber tree plan.

221
00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:08.260
A fucking, it's a tree and a plant

222
00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:14.920
doesn't make any sense. It's the Bruce Jenner of fucking trees.

223
00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:20.360
It's hybrid. It's got a leg on either side of the fence.

224
00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:26.500
Um, let me look this shit up. Oh, you get to listen to bill type here.

225
00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:32.850
Just what makes that little lowland think he can climb that rubber tree.

226
00:13:33.911 --> 00:13:37.720
Plant rubber tree plant.

227
00:13:37.721 --> 00:13:42.721
Maybe they just put plants in there so it would Ryan with everyone knows that it

228
00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:46.390
can't climb a rubber tree plant.

229
00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:48.593
<v 0>Okay.</v>

230
00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:53.100
<v 1>All right. Images. Well that looks like a fucking plant to me.</v>

231
00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:59.910
Robert Tree plant. Why? What is that?

232
00:13:59.911 --> 00:14:04.250
Any of them say rubber tree plan on it. Robert Tree plant.

233
00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:08.390
You know what? My apologies to Frank Sinatra. Whoever wrote that fucking song.

234
00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:11.480
Robert Tree plant be the first to view this product.

235
00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:15.700
You can get one for 50 bucks. Don't. I'm telling you,

236
00:14:15.701 --> 00:14:17.660
if you fucking had a bunch of those things,

237
00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:20.630
if you had a bunch of Robert Tree plants, right,

238
00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:23.570
and you just grew them in a greenhouse outside your house,

239
00:14:23.571 --> 00:14:26.450
all your neighbors would think that you would fucking, you know,

240
00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:28.670
dealing weed and all you would deal with,

241
00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:33.180
with just making yourself your own homemade radio ty. Yes.

242
00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:36.063
<v 0>Okay.</v>

243
00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:39.300
<v 1>Can you still buy studded tires? Do you remember those fucking things?</v>

244
00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:43.470
They had nails in a, you know,

245
00:14:44.130 --> 00:14:49.130
you can run over children with them and they blame the kids studded tires.

246
00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:53.510
There you go. Studied tires for Studley snow tires,

247
00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:58.920
images for studded tires are good that you get a little traction.

248
00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:02.850
Then of course some rednecks got to do it with the spikes coming out.

249
00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:05.773
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

250
00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:07.011
<v 1>I love those rednecks.</v>

251
00:15:07.011 --> 00:15:12.011
Who Like wrote La Roland Cole that fucking dopes like that make it some sort of

252
00:15:12.681 --> 00:15:17.300
statement and they always turn it on and they blow the black smoke into a Prius.

253
00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:22.430
Yeah. So he's a guy who's like pumping their fist.

254
00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:25.610
<v 0>MMM [inaudible]</v>

255
00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:28.450
<v 1>I dunno. It's one of my favorite things. What was I talking about? Yeah.</v>

256
00:15:28.451 --> 00:15:31.450
You gotta go back to make the kids toys. If I was elected president,

257
00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.420
if I was running for office, right.

258
00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:39.480
I, I, that's what I would say. I would go up there.

259
00:15:39.510 --> 00:15:44.010
I would completely ignore Donald Trump. And whenever he talked to me,

260
00:15:44.011 --> 00:15:45.870
I would just look at the crowd and be like,

261
00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:50.580
is he puckering his lips or his lips still? Puckered I can't look at him.

262
00:15:50.581 --> 00:15:55.440
He looks, he looks like an old angry fish who didn't achieve his dreams.

263
00:15:55.760 --> 00:16:00.390
And now we pick it on all the younger fish, sorry.

264
00:16:01.590 --> 00:16:03.300
And his hair is the color of a goldfish.

265
00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:05.923
<v 0>Um,</v>

266
00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:07.550
<v 1>I would just say listen,</v>

267
00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:12.290
but we need to do is we need to get the population down to where we can make

268
00:16:12.291 --> 00:16:15.830
children's toys out of wood, metal and rubber again.

269
00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:21.930
Do you understand me? We've got to stop vaccinating people for polio.

270
00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:27.360
We've got to let the measles come back. We gotta we gotta burn off the hurt.

271
00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:28.973
Okay.

272
00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:33.840
I said we need to do so we can once again make toys,

273
00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:36.900
but a wood, metal and rubber. Same thing with cars.

274
00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:41.010
And I don't give a fuck about safety. No more crumple zones.

275
00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:45.210
All right. Go back to the old days.

276
00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:49.320
I'm gonna stick you in fucking model t's, you know,

277
00:16:49.321 --> 00:16:52.230
driving around in a Goddamn toaster. That's what's going to happen.

278
00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:55.590
And then you whip around the corner, you flip the fucking thing over,

279
00:16:55.591 --> 00:16:59.490
and that's it for you. Right? And you biodegrade.

280
00:16:59.610 --> 00:17:00.720
And so does the car,

281
00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:04.590
cause it's gotta to be no more growth or mourns and preservatives or really that

282
00:17:04.591 --> 00:17:07.620
shit in the fucking food. Oh yeah. People are gonna Starve.

283
00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:11.590
Goddamn right. They are. They're gonna fucking star.

284
00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:13.980
<v 0>Right.</v>

285
00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:15.210
<v 1>But they're going to biodegrade.</v>

286
00:17:16.110 --> 00:17:16.943
<v 0>Okay.</v>

287
00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:18.480
<v 1>And they will create,</v>

288
00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:23.190
will throw them all in the same fucking ditch and they will create a fossil fuel

289
00:17:23.191 --> 00:17:25.680
that we can use to gather in the future.

290
00:17:27.450 --> 00:17:28.080
<v 0>Okay.</v>

291
00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:30.540
<v 1>What kind of octane you think that would be? Is that the right word?</v>

292
00:17:32.290 --> 00:17:32.540
<v 0>Okay.</v>

293
00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:36.570
<v 1>You know, human beings turns into a fossil fuel. Do you think we'd be in 87</v>

294
00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:38.770
<v 0>okay.</v>

295
00:17:38.770 --> 00:17:43.460
<v 1>91 or 93 whatever the fuck that means. Is that just a purification process?</v>

296
00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:44.001
You know, it's funny.

297
00:17:44.001 --> 00:17:48.050
There's actually somebody who's not in that industry that actually could explain

298
00:17:48.051 --> 00:17:52.830
it. That's the kind of person you do not want to be in a car with for any long,

299
00:17:52.890 --> 00:17:55.950
like I don't, I can't want it. What the fuck?

300
00:17:55.951 --> 00:17:58.110
I'm trying to say long specific time,

301
00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:02.340
but didn't sound right in my fucking head and I still said it a long period of

302
00:18:02.341 --> 00:18:03.174
time.

303
00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:04.160
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

304
00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:07.910
<v 1>That fucking guy who just knows a little bit about everything,</v>

305
00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:11.660
but he's still fucking in that fucking one bedroom apartment.

306
00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:14.600
You know that guy still in that same apartment.

307
00:18:14.930 --> 00:18:19.400
He's been there for 13 fucking years and that's not a subject on the planet that

308
00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:24.410
she could fucking bring up yet that cont has not got his bag of gold.

309
00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:27.950
Why is that? I'll tell you why. If you,

310
00:18:28.030 --> 00:18:30.900
you're the town of fucking person that no one wants to drive across town within

311
00:18:30.901 --> 00:18:31.734
a fucking car.

312
00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:34.950
Do you think somebody wants to spend eight hours a day in a board room with you?

313
00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:39.390
They don't. They're going to bury you in that sea of cubicles, right?

314
00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:44.040
They're going to use you as a litmus test to see who the fuck is tough enough to

315
00:18:44.041 --> 00:18:45.210
get to the next level.

316
00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:49.710
I'll tell you think that Susie Q down there has got this stuff for maybe a

317
00:18:49.711 --> 00:18:53.340
corner office. I know what we'll do. We'll stick them right next to Burt,

318
00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:56.490
who fucking knows something about everything right,

319
00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:58.680
but can't even clean the sleep out of his fucking,

320
00:18:58.681 --> 00:19:02.910
I have him sticking his head over a cubicle everyday with this stale,

321
00:19:02.911 --> 00:19:05.070
not quite bad, but not quite fresh breath.

322
00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.480
Listening to our conversations on the phone. You know

323
00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:15.570
Dandy. What are you doing this weekend? Let's get brunch.

324
00:19:15.571 --> 00:19:20.040
I'm dying to go to low. Liz Bees, they have the best French toast.

325
00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:22.110
Then he pops his fucking head over the wall.

326
00:19:22.650 --> 00:19:27.240
Actually it's French toast was not created in France. Little known fact.

327
00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:29.290
<v 0>Okay,</v>

328
00:19:29.290 --> 00:19:30.980
<v 1>well she could fucking handle that.</v>

329
00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:35.840
She gets the corner office day after fucking day. It's literally,

330
00:19:36.050 --> 00:19:40.070
it's gotten to the point she can't have an orgasm because she just keeps hearing

331
00:19:40.071 --> 00:19:42.530
his fucking voice in her head. You know,

332
00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:45.800
a boyfriend thinks she's fucking around on him.

333
00:19:45.910 --> 00:19:49.700
Her whole fucking life is falling apart. Bitch. She says new age woman, right?

334
00:19:49.701 --> 00:19:53.450
She's willed herself not to have a period she's going for that fucking corner

335
00:19:53.451 --> 00:19:54.284
office.

336
00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:57.350
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

337
00:19:57.350 --> 00:19:58.850
<v 1>you know something, if you're sitting there right now, go,</v>

338
00:19:58.851 --> 00:20:02.060
what the fuck is this guy talking about? I'm not talking about anything.

339
00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:03.480
I have a,

340
00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:08.660
a moral obligation to talk for a half an hour every fucking Thursday.

341
00:20:08.661 --> 00:20:10.460
God Damn. And I'm only 20 minutes in.

342
00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.410
I was woken up before I wanted to wake up and uh, you know, I'm a little grumpy

343
00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:21.650
by the way. My new fucking Bible, uh,

344
00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:25.880
my new fucking religion is Mario Batali's a cookbook.

345
00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:30.290
I made the uh, chicken. How does hunter style,

346
00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:31.880
which I had never heard of.

347
00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:35.840
It was absolutely fucking delicious and I messed it up a little bit too,

348
00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:38.570
when it was still fucking delicious. Could use a little more salt.

349
00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:41.570
And I had my heat on a little bit high,

350
00:20:41.571 --> 00:20:44.330
but I took the chicken off early and I didn't overcook it. Thank God.

351
00:20:45.290 --> 00:20:47.290
Cause the lovely Nia came and she goes, I think it's done. Go.

352
00:20:47.291 --> 00:20:49.610
You think it's done? She goes, yeah, she goes, cut into it. I go,

353
00:20:49.611 --> 00:20:52.810
I hate cutting into it. I don't want to cut into it cause if it's not done,

354
00:20:52.811 --> 00:20:55.780
then I'm letting all the fucking juices out and it dries up. She goes,

355
00:20:55.781 --> 00:20:58.780
I think it's done. I said, all right. I could've brown it a little more,

356
00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:00.940
get a little more of a golden color, but other than that,

357
00:21:00.941 --> 00:21:05.620
it was fucking delicious. What's in it you want to add? You want,

358
00:21:05.621 --> 00:21:08.290
you might've not have asked. You know what? Let me hit pause. I'll read a fully,

359
00:21:08.291 --> 00:21:09.124
hang on.

360
00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:10.313
<v 0>Okay.</v>

361
00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:16.210
<v 1>All right. I'm back. Okay. Yeah. Chicken hunters style. All right.</v>

362
00:21:16.211 --> 00:21:16.541
He says,

363
00:21:16.541 --> 00:21:21.541
chicken cacciatore seemed to be a subset for every mediocre chicken dish ever

364
00:21:22.150 --> 00:21:26.920
served to me at our restaurants in restaurants in the seventies and eighties.

365
00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:30.300
I love these talking shit right out of the right out of the gate saying

366
00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:33.820
everybody else is fucked up this dish. But I'm not, um,

367
00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:38.710
anything with a mushroom or an onion in it. Qualified for the title in my world.

368
00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:42.610
Chicken. Cacciatore is a simple braise that depends on a lot of quality,

369
00:21:43.150 --> 00:21:45.880
a lot on the quality of the bird itself, but blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

370
00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:50.890
So I'm clear. You gotta stop staring at me. It's going to happen.

371
00:21:51.010 --> 00:21:53.860
We're going to go to the place you want to go to. Alright?

372
00:21:54.130 --> 00:21:55.300
You already did number one.

373
00:21:55.301 --> 00:21:58.930
You already did number two and I gave you a big can of food with that extra shit

374
00:21:58.931 --> 00:22:03.610
you liked on top. All right, I have the podcast to do. I have an obligation.

375
00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:05.350
Don't yawn in the middle of this.

376
00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:11.550
Where would you be without me? Where would you be without humans?

377
00:22:11.551 --> 00:22:15.420
You know what you'd be? You'd still be a wolf right now.

378
00:22:15.421 --> 00:22:19.440
Right now you'd be eyeballing me. Is that thing weak? Can I go for its throat,

379
00:22:20.430 --> 00:22:25.250
Cleo and a different set of circumstances? You'd fucking eat me.

380
00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:30.020
Do you realize that? Huh? I never met a dog.

381
00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:34.370
All right. All right. All right. I've never met a dog that just fuck it.

382
00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:39.360
You're not a fucking little chihuahua. What are you doing?

383
00:22:39.361 --> 00:22:42.540
How are you? I you're claiming me. Is that what the dog was per says?

384
00:22:42.541 --> 00:22:46.050
You don't get down off the couch. Don't lean into me.

385
00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:47.343
<v 0>Okay.</v>

386
00:22:49.090 --> 00:22:53.970
<v 1>I'm gonna Relax. God Damn it. I fucking loved that dog anyways. Clearly.</v>

387
00:22:57.490 --> 00:23:01.680
Um, yeah, so I made it this week came out fucking great. Uh,

388
00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:03.280
the name of Mario Batali's book,

389
00:23:03.281 --> 00:23:08.281
which I highly fucking recommend is a Molto Italiano 327 simple Italian recipes

390
00:23:12.281 --> 00:23:15.430
to cook at home. And uh, let me tell you something right now.

391
00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:20.040
Don't let the words simple fool you. All right?

392
00:23:21.210 --> 00:23:23.100
He keeps fucking, I gotta learn how to do this.

393
00:23:23.101 --> 00:23:24.930
What is this fucking thing he keeps saying?

394
00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:29.760
What's that thing where you put the fucking meat in water like overnight begins

395
00:23:29.761 --> 00:23:33.750
with a B. I forget what the fuck it is. He keeps bringing that shit up.

396
00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:38.640
It's driving me nuts cause I can't figure out what the f hang on a second.

397
00:23:38.641 --> 00:23:43.290
Hang on a second. I'll find it here. Cleo. Stop looking at me like that.

398
00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:44.970
I love how you, cause you can't,

399
00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:46.910
you just think you're just going to stare at me.

400
00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:49.860
<v 3>Um, okay.</v>

401
00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:54.700
<v 1>Where is it? Where is it? Oh,</v>

402
00:23:54.701 --> 00:23:58.590
for fuck sakes. Whatever.

403
00:23:58.591 --> 00:23:59.970
You guys know what I'm talking about.

404
00:23:59.971 --> 00:24:03.750
You fucking incident an old school way of like Luis to try to preserve the meat.

405
00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:07.890
But then people found out that it actually added flavor to it and he keeps

406
00:24:07.891 --> 00:24:12.270
sending me to like page three 76 to learn how to fucking do this shit.

407
00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:13.313
Brining

408
00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:18.570
brining was originally used as a means of preserving meats and other foods.

409
00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:20.610
Since the advent of refrigeration,

410
00:24:20.730 --> 00:24:23.220
such preserving techniques have become unnecessary,

411
00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:28.080
but brining has become popular again as a means of increasing the succulents of

412
00:24:28.081 --> 00:24:32.220
meat or bird cuts, that lack of fat or great flavor.

413
00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:35.940
So I got to learn how to fucking do that. Isn't that great, Cleo?

414
00:24:36.030 --> 00:24:39.490
Like I didn't have enough on my plate. Speaking of what, you know,

415
00:24:39.491 --> 00:24:41.790
what an exciting thing I'm going to go, go do today.

416
00:24:42.270 --> 00:24:43.770
I'm going to get my luggage repaired.

417
00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:48.930
I got this fucking pigeon toed wheel that's been fucking the bane of my

418
00:24:48.931 --> 00:24:53.100
existence as I go through every fucking airport in this country. Um,

419
00:24:53.370 --> 00:24:56.400
I can only carry the luggage on the right side if I'm on the left side.

420
00:24:56.401 --> 00:25:00.870
And that thing is that that fucked up wheel is leading the charge. Um,

421
00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:05.730
it's over and it's going to affect my mood and I'm going to be rude to people

422
00:25:05.790 --> 00:25:10.170
and, uh, I'm finally going to get it fixed before I start another year.

423
00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:14.550
I'm out on the road. Um, oh, by the way,

424
00:25:14.551 --> 00:25:18.540
the Patrice O'Neil event is coming up. Uh,

425
00:25:18.541 --> 00:25:23.310
the benefit is coming up in, uh, Jesus Christ in a couple of weeks.

426
00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:24.960
Are you kidding me? Are you kidding?

427
00:25:27.130 --> 00:25:27.963
<v 3>Um,</v>

428
00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:31.270
<v 1>it's going to be on January the 26th.</v>

429
00:25:31.870 --> 00:25:35.350
Now I'm getting into town before then.

430
00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:40.620
Wouldn't it be nice if all freckles maybe did a couple of warm up dates in the

431
00:25:41.621 --> 00:25:45.590
tristate area? Uh, look for an,

432
00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:49.840
an announcement on those shows in the next week or so. Um,

433
00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:55.240
and I'll be working with an old friend of mine, uh, Al Del Benny,

434
00:25:55.630 --> 00:26:00.220
who I started off with a long time ago and he's coming in all the way from

435
00:26:00.221 --> 00:26:02.230
Australia. Um,

436
00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:06.910
we all started out together with the late great Patrice O'Neil and last year

437
00:26:06.911 --> 00:26:09.340
when I was working Sydney, Australia,

438
00:26:09.341 --> 00:26:13.930
I reconnected with them and we were telling all these hilarious stories about

439
00:26:13.931 --> 00:26:17.500
Patrice and how much we missed him. And he said, man, I would love to come back.

440
00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:20.680
I go, you'd fly all the way in from Sydney, Australia.

441
00:26:20.681 --> 00:26:22.750
And he goes in a fucking heartbeat. That all right.

442
00:26:22.751 --> 00:26:27.490
That's what Patrice meant to all of us. So he came all the way back and, um,

443
00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:31.330
we're going to be doing some shows together to help him, uh,

444
00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:35.170
pay for his trip and then we're going to do the benefit on Tuesday nights should

445
00:26:35.171 --> 00:26:36.910
be a great time. Um,

446
00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:40.930
which is one of the good things that's actually come out of this tragedy,

447
00:26:40.931 --> 00:26:44.520
this fucking awfulness is that a, you know,

448
00:26:44.550 --> 00:26:49.140
we all get to get together once a year, um, and do a good thing.

449
00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:54.000
So before it gets sad, I'm going to move on. Um,

450
00:26:55.070 --> 00:26:56.730
why did we go here? Yeah.

451
00:26:56.731 --> 00:27:00.750
So I've watched like three fucking Celtic games in a row and I'm already

452
00:27:00.751 --> 00:27:02.450
watching the Bruins games. It's like we're,

453
00:27:02.610 --> 00:27:05.610
I feel like I'm still living in Boston right now. It's kind of Nice. You know,

454
00:27:05.611 --> 00:27:09.320
the games come on at like four, four 30 out here. I tape them.

455
00:27:09.321 --> 00:27:13.320
I start watching them at like six. I can get the game done in about 90 minutes.

456
00:27:13.321 --> 00:27:17.100
I can still go out and do my spots. It's great.

457
00:27:17.670 --> 00:27:19.890
So I actually know some of the Celtics names. Now.

458
00:27:20.010 --> 00:27:24.960
We've got a guy a say a Thomas, no relation point. God Jae Crowder.

459
00:27:24.961 --> 00:27:29.700
I like, what the fuck's the other guys? They, uh,

460
00:27:29.970 --> 00:27:33.000
whenever I look at his name, I can't, I can't fucking pronounce it. Kelly.

461
00:27:35.270 --> 00:27:37.710
Oh, Nina. Whatever. That fucking, I can never fucking,

462
00:27:37.711 --> 00:27:41.490
I'm about to see his goddamn name. I Dunno. Evidently. Uh,

463
00:27:41.790 --> 00:27:45.720
Tommy Heinsohn thinks he's one of the best big men passing in the game.

464
00:27:46.350 --> 00:27:47.940
Kelly Olynyk. There you go.

465
00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:49.650
<v 0>Okay.</v>

466
00:27:49.650 --> 00:27:54.030
<v 1>I had to like walk away from it. So we lost a Brooklyn,</v>

467
00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:56.880
we beat Brooklyn. And then last night we fucking had the game,

468
00:27:56.881 --> 00:28:01.860
the whole fucking game and playing the Pistons and then they just kept chipping

469
00:28:01.861 --> 00:28:04.220
away at it. I mean,

470
00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:08.040
I don't know shit about the Celtics other than they score like 30 to 37 in the

471
00:28:08.041 --> 00:28:10.560
first quarter every night. And then, you know, you're like,

472
00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:13.830
I literally texted Virginia, I'm like the Celtics, it'll lighten it up,

473
00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.390
you know, shooting some high percentage in the next quarter.

474
00:28:18.391 --> 00:28:19.590
They just shit the bed.

475
00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:24.900
They always say that about basketball to gave a rugs game of runs.

476
00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:26.940
Oh yeah. Be sure it isn't fixed.

477
00:28:27.050 --> 00:28:30.420
And I'd shaven points to keep the fucking crowd interested cause if you blow

478
00:28:30.421 --> 00:28:32.880
them out in the first quarter that people each going to turn the channel.

479
00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:38.070
I Dunno. So whatever. Then this fucking kid ran Reggie Jackson.

480
00:28:38.490 --> 00:28:42.300
No relation. So old. I have these fucking kids that coming around.

481
00:28:42.301 --> 00:28:46.260
They get the same names of the greats that I watched when I was a kid. Uh,

482
00:28:46.261 --> 00:28:51.120
Reggie Jackson, Jesus Christ, kids got ice water in his veins. He did that game.

483
00:28:51.121 --> 00:28:54.360
I don't know anything about him, but you know what's killing me is the pistons,

484
00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:57.300
they're back. They got mixed filthy and McNasty again,

485
00:28:57.510 --> 00:28:59.100
except it's the white version.

486
00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:03.730
They had this fucking beard and white dude going out there. Right.

487
00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:09.900
This guy used up five fouls in about six minutes and they kept them in for the

488
00:29:10.451 --> 00:29:13.990
whole fucking game. He never filed out.

489
00:29:14.110 --> 00:29:18.070
They had him and then they got this other big white dude who looks like the

490
00:29:18.071 --> 00:29:21.490
fucking one of the bad guys. All areas.

491
00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:26.610
Ehrsson elite solver, dude.

492
00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:30.720
You tell me that guy doesn't look like that guy from the James Bond movie metal

493
00:29:30.721 --> 00:29:33.510
mouth that had the, the uh, the metal in his mouth.

494
00:29:34.250 --> 00:29:37.680
Very a very clever name. Um,

495
00:29:39.330 --> 00:29:42.010
you had him at a, who's the other guy?

496
00:29:43.030 --> 00:29:46.150
Aaron bades white.

497
00:29:46.390 --> 00:29:48.340
Mick filthy and white McNasty.

498
00:29:48.370 --> 00:29:52.600
Now for people who didn't watch the Celtics pissed as rivalry,

499
00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:57.190
don't know that reference. That was a bill Laimbeer who I guess was a white guy.

500
00:29:57.220 --> 00:30:00.790
I guess now it's all white. McPhillips the McNasty um,

501
00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:04.150
Bill and bear and uh, the other guy who actually liked

502
00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:11.750
Rick Mahorn does that right? Mic Round Horn. That's right. And uh, what's his,

503
00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:15.590
they will fucking, you know, Morn was just a tough motherfucker.

504
00:30:15.650 --> 00:30:20.510
Bill lamp beer was a piece of shit. That guy was a piece of shit.

505
00:30:20.511 --> 00:30:22.940
But I gotta give it up to that guy at the top of the key.

506
00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:26.870
He fucking hit that shot every God damn time. But other than that,

507
00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:28.580
he was just a piece of shit.

508
00:30:29.030 --> 00:30:33.080
And I remember watching the 30 for 30 on the bad boys in Detroit, and he goes,

509
00:30:33.081 --> 00:30:35.840
you know, we used to try and play a mind game. He's trying to play mind games.

510
00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:39.380
He act like he was out there playing chess. It's just like bill,

511
00:30:39.530 --> 00:30:44.210
you would take in guys knees out. He would throw in elbows to the head.

512
00:30:44.270 --> 00:30:45.410
That's not a head game.

513
00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:48.740
That's just punching somebody in the face when they're looking up,

514
00:30:48.741 --> 00:30:52.700
trying to get a rebound. It's not a head game in that, that deep.

515
00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:55.153
Um,

516
00:30:55.550 --> 00:30:59.390
two favorite things was when Larry Bird punched him in the fucking face

517
00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:03.770
as land barrow. He at the biggest whiny look on his face.

518
00:31:04.100 --> 00:31:08.300
He was like a giant Danny Ainge. And when, uh,

519
00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:13.210
chief Robert Parish just gave him, like, he gave him like a,

520
00:31:13.250 --> 00:31:17.750
he punched him with like, his forearms, gave him like this overhead, like, uh,

521
00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:21.860
he was like, uh, when the UFC guys do like the fucking ground and pound,

522
00:31:21.861 --> 00:31:26.861
except it was the inside of his forearm and he was standing behind them and was

523
00:31:27.681 --> 00:31:32.510
so fucking great that he was on the ground covering up like a little girl.

524
00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:36.110
And he was such a piece of shit. The refs didn't see it.

525
00:31:36.111 --> 00:31:39.410
They knew what happened, but they didn't call anything was fucking tremendous.

526
00:31:39.411 --> 00:31:42.950
But whatever. Anyways, they got these two guys now. Um,

527
00:31:44.610 --> 00:31:47.180
uh, Aaron Bains and Ehrsson,

528
00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:53.770
Les Sova, whatever the fuck their names are. Uh, just,

529
00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:55.320
I dunno that it was more about the banes guy.

530
00:31:55.330 --> 00:31:57.610
I'm judging these guys on one fucking, I'm sure they'd good players,

531
00:31:57.611 --> 00:32:01.660
but I'm judging them on one fucking night, but a, what's his, but I don't know.

532
00:32:01.661 --> 00:32:06.100
I thought, I thought that dude, Reggie Jackson looked fucking great. Um,

533
00:32:06.610 --> 00:32:08.980
and then on the other nights, I want you to the fucking Bruins. It's great.

534
00:32:09.010 --> 00:32:14.010
Even though we fucking can't get a run going lost to the capitals again.

535
00:32:14.410 --> 00:32:16.960
Fucking cuts. Um, whatever.

536
00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:21.820
I'm going to keep watching cause I have a true fan. Clean. Relax.

537
00:32:21.821 --> 00:32:25.930
I'm almost done yet. How much time I got left? Oh, 32 minutes.

538
00:32:26.650 --> 00:32:29.850
32 minutes. All right. So that's uh, that's about it. I,

539
00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:34.860
I did my contractually obligated fucking blabbering by the way.

540
00:32:35.741 --> 00:32:39.710
I, it's actually been raining out here in la, which has been tremendous. Um,

541
00:32:41.090 --> 00:32:44.270
God knows we need, it's like the first sustained, we like two days of like,

542
00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:48.410
we're rained for like half the day, like pouring, which is tremendous.

543
00:32:48.650 --> 00:32:49.550
And they always give, you know,

544
00:32:49.551 --> 00:32:52.640
La people shit because they freak out when it rains. It's like,

545
00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:56.540
well we live in a desert. And then secondly, people just go lay down drive.

546
00:32:56.541 --> 00:32:58.850
It's just, it's fucking rain. Well, what happens is,

547
00:32:59.030 --> 00:33:01.970
is when it doesn't rain for a long time,

548
00:33:02.930 --> 00:33:04.790
what happens is on the roads,

549
00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:09.810
all the fucking shit from the cars, you know,

550
00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:13.500
oil, antifreeze, transmission, fluid, brake fluid,

551
00:33:13.501 --> 00:33:14.910
all that shit that leaks.

552
00:33:15.330 --> 00:33:19.880
It just builds up okay on the ground. And then when the water lands,

553
00:33:19.881 --> 00:33:23.750
it becomes like the soup. So I'm not saying it's like snow,

554
00:33:24.020 --> 00:33:27.740
but it's a little worse than east coast because I used to flip out when I was

555
00:33:27.741 --> 00:33:30.410
out here. Like these fucking people are acting like it's a blizzard out here.

556
00:33:30.620 --> 00:33:35.390
It's just rain. Just fucking go. But uh, it is a little bit, yeah,

557
00:33:35.410 --> 00:33:38.600
it's a little bit of both. They drive like pussies out here and uh,

558
00:33:38.690 --> 00:33:43.610
the rain is a little more slippery. Uh, Jesus Christ on the worst.

559
00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:44.840
Um, all right. That's it.

560
00:33:44.841 --> 00:33:48.080
That's the podcast for this fucking are the Thursday afternoon podcasts.

561
00:33:48.081 --> 00:33:48.980
I just checked in on.

562
00:33:49.010 --> 00:33:51.140
I just thought just checking in to see how your week's going.

563

564
00:33:54.651 --> 00:33:56.930
I hope you have a wonderful dog in your life like I do right now.

565
00:33:56.931 --> 00:34:00.800
That's just sitting staring at me cause it has an inability to talk.

566
00:34:01.340 --> 00:34:04.850
So what it does is it walks over and it sits down like a foot away from me when

567
00:34:04.851 --> 00:34:08.060
it isn't itching itself and it just stares at me.

568

<v 0>[inaudible].</v>

623
00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:14.590
<v 6>He's the son of the government man on a pillar.</v>

624
00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:19.490
I was bombed with God on my hands and have all the signs of it.

625
00:38:20.190 --> 00:38:20.670
<v 5>All right.</v>

626
00:38:20.670 --> 00:38:25.670
Well I went to another Rosebowl everybody and I think I'm just now starting to

627
00:38:25.861 --> 00:38:28.800
recover. First of all, what a fucking game. I,

628
00:38:29.450 --> 00:38:33.510
I'm just like, the rose bowls are already unbelievable,

629
00:38:33.511 --> 00:38:36.130
but to add that whole playoff fucking atmosphere too,

630
00:38:36.130 --> 00:38:39.340
<v 7>it was just insane. And uh,</v>

631
00:38:40.090 --> 00:38:43.780
this year me and all the guys we got over there,

632
00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:48.970
we was so fucking organized this year we,

633
00:38:49.010 --> 00:38:51.170
we had, we had fucking everything.

634
00:38:52.190 --> 00:38:56.000
We had fucking everything, food, booze,

635
00:38:56.450 --> 00:38:57.283
other stuff.

636
00:39:02.090 --> 00:39:07.090
Jason Lai had put on a display of tailgate cooking that it was,

637
00:39:08.450 --> 00:39:13.280
he had a career year. That's what we were saying. He had a breakout.

638
00:39:13.310 --> 00:39:17.210
It was just fucking, and it was the best breakfast sandwich I ever had.

639
00:39:17.990 --> 00:39:19.940
Then he made these ribs that were unbelievable.

640
00:39:19.941 --> 00:39:23.390
Then we went to the game and at the end of the game it was freezing out by then

641
00:39:23.420 --> 00:39:24.920
and we was smart as how smart we were.

642
00:39:24.921 --> 00:39:29.400
We brought up quarter wood and one of the grills we turned into just like a fire

643
00:39:29.930 --> 00:39:32.510
pit and everybody else who was waiting for the traffic,

644
00:39:32.511 --> 00:39:36.140
every Balis people were coming and gathering around our little fire going,

645
00:39:36.141 --> 00:39:38.120
you guys are smart. Oh this is really smart.

646
00:39:38.270 --> 00:39:41.030
What I left out is we brought everything except fire.

647
00:39:41.060 --> 00:39:42.530
We forgot to bring a lighter.

648
00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:45.290
They were bringing the grills and they were bringing the charcoal.

649
00:39:45.291 --> 00:39:48.380
So I assumed that they were going to bring the fucking lighter and I brought the

650
00:39:48.650 --> 00:39:51.050
Lennar every year. So I guess that one was on me. I don't know what.

651
00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:54.560
But other than that it was a, uh,

652
00:39:55.880 --> 00:39:58.550
it was another amazing time. And um,

653
00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:00.753
<v 0>okay.</v>

654
00:40:00.810 --> 00:40:03.750
<v 7>It was fucking hilarious. We basically, we get into the game,</v>

655
00:40:04.170 --> 00:40:06.840
got in on time cause it's a fucking playoff game. Right.

656
00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:09.990
And there was so many people getting tickets that I couldn't get four together.

657
00:40:09.991 --> 00:40:12.100
I got two and two. So we were like couple rows,

658
00:40:12.750 --> 00:40:16.740
two or three rows in front of a nick and lie ahead. And we're sitting there,

659
00:40:16.741 --> 00:40:20.760
you know, and I'm pretty, I'm not as bad as I was last year, but I was fucking,

660
00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:23.310
uh, I was feeling no plane. All right.

661
00:40:23.340 --> 00:40:26.910
I was definitely more than dehydrated at that point.

662
00:40:27.030 --> 00:40:32.030
And all of a sudden I see security walking out with Jason Lawhead and there's

663
00:40:33.781 --> 00:40:34.021
no,

664
00:40:34.021 --> 00:40:38.820
Joe Botnick in Jay is looking at him over at me with his hands,

665
00:40:38.850 --> 00:40:42.030
like up like what the fuck? And he's yelling at me and I'm going,

666
00:40:43.460 --> 00:40:46.050
Jay Jay way they take it and I'm in like, I'm in the middle of this fucking row.

667
00:40:46.050 --> 00:40:49.710
There's like 30 people on one side, 30 on the other, this old school stadium,

668
00:40:49.711 --> 00:40:53.910
right. Total fucking fire hazard. Right. I'm like, Jake, where you go Jay,

669
00:40:53.911 --> 00:40:55.590
and he's fucking yell at me. I can't hear.

670
00:40:56.700 --> 00:40:58.980
And that just whisking them out so fast.

671
00:40:58.981 --> 00:41:02.150
There's nothing I could do other than I just keep going with j j

672
00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:09.330
plus looking at me like, what the fuck turns out?

673
00:41:11.070 --> 00:41:14.850
Uh, I don't know. Bart. Nick was outside.

674
00:41:14.851 --> 00:41:16.980
He was in the stadium but outside the stands,

675
00:41:16.981 --> 00:41:21.090
I guess he had sat down or something and nodded off the,

676
00:41:21.091 --> 00:41:22.020
when he came to,

677
00:41:22.021 --> 00:41:26.250
there was like fucking 20 cops surrounding him cause t such a big guy.

678
00:41:26.251 --> 00:41:28.560
I thought they were like, they were like, what if this guy starts swinging?

679
00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:33.030
We're fucked, and they went down there and they told I,

680
00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:35.160
they looked at his ticket and they went up to get Jason.

681
00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:37.620
That's what they did and they said, we gotta he's been overserved,

682
00:41:37.890 --> 00:41:42.890
which is the understatement for all of us for 2015 and a law had,

683
00:41:43.561 --> 00:41:44.251
to his credit,

684
00:41:44.251 --> 00:41:48.180
the only thing he did better than cooking was talk his way out of that.

685
00:41:48.990 --> 00:41:52.320
He just kept going, I'll come. I look at a Guy [inaudible], he's a teddy bear.

686
00:41:52.690 --> 00:41:53.960
He said, he's not, he's not hurting anybody.

687
00:41:53.961 --> 00:41:56.870
He's going to go off days and sit down. He's going to be able to use it.

688
00:41:56.940 --> 00:41:57.900
He just kept saying,

689
00:41:57.901 --> 00:42:02.160
he's a teddy bear and Joe was just looking at the teddy bear.

690
00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:09.460
They fucking let him in fucking liar.

691
00:42:09.530 --> 00:42:11.730
The politician gets into his seat,

692
00:42:12.750 --> 00:42:17.750
he sits in his seat and then promptly fucking passes out and some lady behind

693
00:42:19.110 --> 00:42:21.480
lye head goes, hey, you're going to have to get him outta here.

694
00:42:22.170 --> 00:42:24.450
And Jay just looked at her and said, hey, hey, come on.

695
00:42:25.810 --> 00:42:28.020
[inaudible] he's not hurting anyway. He's a teddy bear. Okay, listen.

696
00:42:28.290 --> 00:42:31.200
And she fucking Judd back at him. And Jay was just like, listen,

697
00:42:31.770 --> 00:42:34.440
if I tell you what, if you will just watch the game,

698
00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:37.440
you're not even going to see them. Okay. I mean,

699
00:42:37.470 --> 00:42:39.840
I can wake them up if you want me to. I'll wake them up.

700
00:42:39.841 --> 00:42:41.880
I don't think you're gonna like it, but I can't wake them up.

701
00:42:41.881 --> 00:42:44.280
And people just started laughing and it was over.

702
00:42:44.550 --> 00:42:49.550
And we had a wonderful time seeing two of the top college football programs play

703
00:42:49.621 --> 00:42:53.140
each other, say hell of a game through two and a half quarters. And then, uh,

704
00:42:53.730 --> 00:42:54.241
Oregon.

705
00:42:54.241 --> 00:42:59.241
I gotta give a shout out to the ducks just for shutting up the FSU band that I

706
00:42:59.491 --> 00:43:02.730
didn't have to hear that, that fucking Tomahawk Chop again. And I do,

707
00:43:02.850 --> 00:43:06.870
I fucking called it that band knows three songs,

708
00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:10.670
they know the school's song, they play something else and then everything else,

709
00:43:12.050 --> 00:43:12.850
<v 8>de la, la, la, la,</v>

710
00:43:12.850 --> 00:43:15.800
<v 7>the whole fucking game. And I'm</v>

711
00:43:16.940 --> 00:43:17.180
<v 0>okay.</v>

712
00:43:17.180 --> 00:43:20.030
<v 7>It was, I mean, I don't know, I would like to see a little bit of a closer game,</v>

713
00:43:20.031 --> 00:43:24.080
but uh, I really enjoyed, uh, the fact that they shut that band up.

714
00:43:24.081 --> 00:43:25.130
Nothing against FSU.

715
00:43:25.131 --> 00:43:27.590
I actually really liked the Seminoles and I've always loved that program.

716
00:43:27.620 --> 00:43:31.180
But um, somewhere along the line that Tom oc chopped just fucking,

717
00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:35.520
it would be like if at the Red Sox, like, you know,

718
00:43:35.521 --> 00:43:37.620
awful it is when they sing sweet Caroline,

719
00:43:37.621 --> 00:43:40.230
just imagine if they did that between every fucking ending.

720
00:43:40.290 --> 00:43:41.820
I mean you'd want to kill yourself, right?

721
00:43:41.821 --> 00:43:44.370
If you want any sort of a human being. And that includes being a red sox fan,

722
00:43:44.850 --> 00:43:47.790
cause I want to jump off the fucking monster when I hear that fucking song just

723
00:43:47.791 --> 00:43:51.720
once and you're looking around and fucking women putting their head on the

724
00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:56.360
fucking guy's shoulder. It's just like, ah, I don't know.

725
00:43:56.410 --> 00:43:58.990
Well maybe, I don't know. Maybe I should be a little more positive about stuff.

726
00:43:58.991 --> 00:44:01.830
Shit like that. I have no idea. Um,

727
00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:06.800
the rose bowl, everybody, I'll do it. I'll tell you right now,

728
00:44:06.801 --> 00:44:08.750
if you're going to pick a beer to start the day with,

729
00:44:08.810 --> 00:44:11.870
I'm telling you Miller high life, ah, in, in the,

730
00:44:11.900 --> 00:44:16.180
you got to get it in the bottle. Oh my God, the sun's just coming up.

731
00:44:16.181 --> 00:44:19.600
We've got this seven Oh four in the fucking morning. It was freezing cold out.

732
00:44:20.050 --> 00:44:22.840
There was a frost on the fairways. I'm telling you guys,

733
00:44:22.970 --> 00:44:25.600
you got to fucking do this. Okay? You don't got to go to the Rose Bowl.

734
00:44:25.601 --> 00:44:30.601
Fucking pick something that you and all yet dumb guy friends are you and all

735
00:44:32.101 --> 00:44:33.720
your dumb fucking women friends.

736
00:44:33.721 --> 00:44:38.220
Just you gotta have that one thing you'd do every year. You gotta have that.

737
00:44:38.221 --> 00:44:40.890
I don't give a fuck what kind of responsibility you gotta.

738
00:44:40.891 --> 00:44:43.980
You gotta have that one fucking thing. So anyways, we got there.

739
00:44:43.981 --> 00:44:48.980
The frost was on the fucking fairways. I actually said this year when I got out,

740
00:44:48.981 --> 00:44:51.170
I said, hey guys, guys gotta go take this in right here.

741
00:44:51.590 --> 00:44:53.000
This is the best part of the tailgate.

742
00:44:53.001 --> 00:44:57.050
It's the beginning and this time tomorrow, you're going to wish that,

743
00:44:57.590 --> 00:44:59.420
that this fucking moment, actually no,

744
00:44:59.570 --> 00:45:02.450
cause you'd be too hung over three days later when you get all the poison out of

745
00:45:02.451 --> 00:45:04.940
your system, you're going to be fucking longing for that feeling.

746
00:45:05.750 --> 00:45:09.230
Do we get out of that truck ear to ear, fucking grins

747
00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:12.170
and then Bart,

748
00:45:12.380 --> 00:45:16.730
it's got this thing that he yells out to everybody to the entire parking lot.

749
00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:21.590
Um, I don't want to say what it is cause he yells at so fucking loud.

750
00:45:21.591 --> 00:45:24.020
And so far nobody's ever found our fucking tailgate,

751
00:45:24.021 --> 00:45:27.430
which has been great because we make a spectacle of ourselves. Um,

752
00:45:27.790 --> 00:45:30.350
you got to do it. So anyways, the Rosebowl let's, let's read this thing here.

753
00:45:30.550 --> 00:45:34.700
Uh, Dear Billy football, uh, love the podcast.

754
00:45:34.790 --> 00:45:37.450
He knew his special was nothing short of amazing. Thank you very much.

755
00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:39.620
Thank you everybody who has been watching it,

756
00:45:39.621 --> 00:45:42.740
rewatching it and telling other people to watch my new special you people are

757
00:45:42.741 --> 00:45:46.990
all the same. I'm sorry. Jesus Christ. I'm sorry you feel that way. Ah,

758
00:45:47.030 --> 00:45:51.330
Jesus Bill. Um, I really appreciate it because, uh,

759
00:45:51.390 --> 00:45:55.730
this one has been getting the best response and uh, you know,

760
00:45:55.731 --> 00:45:58.420
that makes me look good with the people I'm in business with over there and

761
00:45:58.421 --> 00:46:02.630
Netflix. So, uh, you guys did me a solid. I really appreciate it. All right.

762
00:46:03.500 --> 00:46:06.230
Um, anyways. Anyways, here we go. Anyway,

763
00:46:06.231 --> 00:46:09.020
I had a question about your Rosebowl outing last weekend.

764
00:46:09.080 --> 00:46:14.080
The game itself was great from that opening Oregon drive when Marietta thought

765
00:46:14.820 --> 00:46:17.630
that's how you say his name. I didn't, there's two Heisman trophy winners.

766
00:46:17.631 --> 00:46:18.770
I don't even know their fucking names.

767
00:46:19.010 --> 00:46:22.610
I was so busy this year and I was so hammered.

768
00:46:22.611 --> 00:46:26.440
I even had a fucking program. I had no idea, uh,

769
00:46:27.010 --> 00:46:31.760
of pitched it to the guy who somersaulted to the one yard line f and later

770
00:46:31.761 --> 00:46:35.600
completed the two point conversion. All that was great in the beginning, um,

771
00:46:35.630 --> 00:46:40.630
to famous James flopping around fumbling for an Oregon touchdown late in the

772
00:46:41.510 --> 00:46:44.810
third. It was just a great game and I was thoroughly jealous. You were there.

773
00:46:44.840 --> 00:46:48.830
You're obviously an Oregon ducks fan. Uh, my question is,

774
00:46:49.910 --> 00:46:52.730
can you share with us a couple of your favorite moments from this year's

775
00:46:53.130 --> 00:46:54.710
Rosebowl. I kind kinda did that, but there's probably some more.

776
00:46:55.100 --> 00:46:58.130
I'm sure you had. You in the goon squad.

777
00:46:58.131 --> 00:47:03.131
You roll around with a gun in some funny situations or conflicts.

778
00:47:03.681 --> 00:47:07.550
Ps, I saw law ahead and part Nick and Boston for the all things comedy tour.

779
00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:11.210
They were great guys and had the pleasure of sitting with part niquet at the bar

780
00:47:11.211 --> 00:47:14.030
while Jay crushed in on stage. Cool dudes.

781
00:47:14.031 --> 00:47:17.840
I would love to drink and smoke stokes with you all some time.

782
00:47:17.841 --> 00:47:20.720
Happy New Year and go fuck yourself. You Apron wearing cont.

783
00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:26.600
Ah, that was a good one. You bounced it. Um,

784
00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:31.630
I think I've already told uh, the stores. Yeah,

785
00:47:31.860 --> 00:47:34.570
throw on the football or the food. I mean, I don't know.

786
00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:38.830
I was pretty sober but I was kind of a consistent level,

787
00:47:38.870 --> 00:47:42.190
like blacked out. Um,

788
00:47:44.230 --> 00:47:45.910
I dunno what, what was it this year?

789
00:47:49.030 --> 00:47:50.290
Just the whole fucking thing.

790
00:47:50.440 --> 00:47:54.070
You know what's cool is watching a father with his two sons and he was playing

791
00:47:54.071 --> 00:47:57.970
automatic QB, it teaching his kid the quarterback to get inside, you know,

792
00:47:57.971 --> 00:48:01.090
inside the receiver and a watching the big brother,

793
00:48:01.091 --> 00:48:04.660
older brother fucking rivalry reminded me when I was a kid,

794
00:48:05.350 --> 00:48:08.080
I sat there smiling, drinking a beer, probably look like a pedophile,

795
00:48:08.081 --> 00:48:11.140
but I was actually thinking nothing but clean stuff.

796
00:48:11.830 --> 00:48:16.250
Everybody looks like a pedophile now. Um, I dunno,

797
00:48:16.920 --> 00:48:19.720
I gotta be honest with you the whole fucking days, God damn blur.

798
00:48:19.721 --> 00:48:22.210
I remember most of the game I did,

799
00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:25.600
I passed out a little bit in the first quarter for about a minute and a half

800
00:48:25.720 --> 00:48:29.830
football time and then the second quarter for about a minute and a half. But uh,

801
00:48:29.831 --> 00:48:32.920
other than that, you know, I crushed waters for the rest of the fucking game.

802
00:48:32.921 --> 00:48:36.520
I didn't have any beers afterwards cause I had to drive and that's by then,

803
00:48:36.550 --> 00:48:38.890
you know, we stayed there till like eight 30, nine o'clock at night.

804
00:48:38.891 --> 00:48:42.490
So by then I haven't drank in like eight hours. So I'm actually so sober,

805
00:48:42.610 --> 00:48:43.920
I'm fucking hung over at that point.

806
00:48:47.120 --> 00:48:51.920
<v 6>What have we done so far?</v>

807
00:48:58.240 --> 00:48:59.310
[inaudible] phase time

808
00:49:04.890 --> 00:49:06.740
[inaudible] I'll be on the west zoos squad.

809
00:49:06.810 --> 00:49:11.040
<v 7>What's your role this year? And I did not drink. I did not drink.</v>

810
00:49:11.310 --> 00:49:14.820
And I know there's a lot of you who are disappointed that I didn't drink because

811
00:49:14.821 --> 00:49:18.720
you want me to fill up your life with the hilarious story of me making an ass of

812
00:49:18.721 --> 00:49:23.390
myself once again to kick off a new year. Well, God damn it, I didn't,

813
00:49:24.510 --> 00:49:27.330
but I stood around and I watched it enough other people, fuck it. Do it.

814
00:49:27.331 --> 00:49:31.070
And I still have plenty of stories and I got the brain cells to remember them.

815
00:49:32.150 --> 00:49:34.680
Um, it's a fucking awesome game.

816
00:49:34.890 --> 00:49:39.330
It was Wisconsin versus TCU at uh,

817
00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:42.870
I was like, most people were like, who the fuck is TCU?

818
00:49:43.530 --> 00:49:46.650
And then you look in the program. Let me go grab the Rosebowl program.

819
00:49:46.651 --> 00:49:51.470
Hang on one second. Just you guys just sit tight. Just relaxes.

820
00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:53.150
I walk across the road

821
00:49:54.740 --> 00:49:59.480
trying to find the Rosebowl program. Oh, here it is. Look at this.

822
00:49:59.481 --> 00:50:01.930
I found it. I really need to get it.

823
00:50:01.931 --> 00:50:05.250
I want an assistant on this podcast. All right, I'm back.

824
00:50:05.251 --> 00:50:08.820
So here's the Rose Bowl program and basically

825
00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:14.790
the rose bowl this year, if you were going to turn it into an awful,

826
00:50:15.360 --> 00:50:19.180
you're going to turn it into an awful made for TV movie. This was a,

827
00:50:20.040 --> 00:50:23.910
I guess it was a story about respect. All right.

828
00:50:23.911 --> 00:50:28.010
In that people barely respect Wisconsin because they never go to the rose bowl.

829
00:50:28.011 --> 00:50:30.380
I can't remember the last time they won the big 10 championship,

830
00:50:30.381 --> 00:50:34.550
but they finally won it. They won it. And uh,

831
00:50:34.610 --> 00:50:38.390
they beat the likes of, uh, let's, let's see. Let's, let's see who they'd beat.

832
00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:42.020
All right, let's go through their whole fucking season here really quickly.

833
00:50:42.350 --> 00:50:47.100
Stop Rolling your eyes. You fucking Cami. Non Sports Fan cunt. All right.

834
00:50:47.630 --> 00:50:49.870
Start off the year they beat UNL v.

835
00:50:50.450 --> 00:50:53.750
These are the cupcake games early in the end. And they beat San Jose State,

836
00:50:53.751 --> 00:50:57.410
Arizona State. There's a pack 10 team, Austin p. Who is that?

837
00:50:57.620 --> 00:51:02.100
Somebody whose name did they play? One guy. Uh, then they beat Michigan state,

838
00:51:03.150 --> 00:51:07.860
then they beat Minnesota. They beat Ohio state, right? Big 10 Iowa. Purdue.

839
00:51:07.890 --> 00:51:11.250
You've heard of these teams, Indiana, Michigan. One of those teams,

840
00:51:11.310 --> 00:51:15.840
they actually lost two, but I went by too quickly. Northwestern, you know,

841
00:51:16.380 --> 00:51:18.140
they played some fucking teams.

842
00:51:19.130 --> 00:51:23.130
T see you on the other hand, didn't play shit.

843
00:51:24.290 --> 00:51:29.160
It's okay. She down there and outside of Dallas, Texas, Texas,

844
00:51:29.161 --> 00:51:31.740
Christian, O g, she's university.

845
00:51:32.100 --> 00:51:35.220
And you wonder why no one gives a fuck about the mountain west program.

846
00:51:35.221 --> 00:51:39.700
I want you to write me and tell me just exactly. Okay. Oregon state too.

847
00:51:39.710 --> 00:51:43.530
That's PAC 10. That's Tennessee tech. This is their undefeated season.

848
00:51:43.531 --> 00:51:48.240
They beat Oregon State, Tennessee tech, Baylor, SMU,

849
00:51:48.600 --> 00:51:53.550
Colorado state, Wyoming, BYU, air force,

850
00:51:53.700 --> 00:51:58.380
UNL, V, Utah, San Diego State,

851
00:51:58.470 --> 00:52:01.470
New Mexico. That was their undefeated season.

852
00:52:01.620 --> 00:52:05.790
And they're sitting there scratching the top of their fucking heads,

853
00:52:06.150 --> 00:52:10.020
wondering why they're that people are questioning their record.

854
00:52:11.460 --> 00:52:14.880
All right, so here's the deal. I'm sitting there going, all right,

855
00:52:15.150 --> 00:52:19.650
I like this big 10 even though the big 10 isn't what it used to be considering,

856
00:52:19.651 --> 00:52:22.420
they went, oh, and five on fucking New Year's Day. Um,

857
00:52:24.150 --> 00:52:26.550
who doesn't like an underdog? So I'm going, well, fuck it man.

858
00:52:26.551 --> 00:52:29.280
I'm going to root for TCU even though they have Christian. Oh,

859
00:52:29.860 --> 00:52:32.610
she's in the middle of their fucking name, which, you know what that means?

860
00:52:32.790 --> 00:52:35.070
They automatically think they're better than everybody else.

861
00:52:35.280 --> 00:52:39.000
And Jesus loves us best, despite the fact that they're preaching,

862
00:52:39.001 --> 00:52:42.210
that everybody needs to be more understanding like Jesus.

863
00:52:42.330 --> 00:52:45.630
Somehow they miss the irony of the fact that they feel like they're the chosen

864
00:52:45.631 --> 00:52:48.880
ones. Like all stupid fucking religions do. Right?

865
00:52:50.020 --> 00:52:52.240
Jewish people think they are the chosen ones.

866
00:52:53.110 --> 00:52:56.920
Christians think they're the chosen ones. Muslim thinks that the, you know what?

867
00:52:56.921 --> 00:53:00.970
You guys are all a bunch of douchebags. All right. None of you matter.

868
00:53:01.420 --> 00:53:03.640
That's why there's so many of us. If we were special,

869
00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:05.230
they'd only be like nine of us.

870
00:53:06.220 --> 00:53:10.360
Once there's 7 billion of anything I may worry about. We're not special anymore.

871
00:53:10.690 --> 00:53:15.100
Okay. Do you understand that? We're like socks. You know,

872
00:53:17.740 --> 00:53:20.170
actually some poor people can afford socks.

873
00:53:20.171 --> 00:53:22.990
The socks is still important to some people. You know,

874
00:53:23.770 --> 00:53:26.080
I don't want to fuck them. Say it's a, they

875
00:53:26.260 --> 00:53:30.210
<v 2>got a fucking pay in their bonnet about how nobody's respecting them.</v>

876
00:53:30.390 --> 00:53:33.960
So I'm sitting there, this is before I talked to anybody from TCU. I just saw,

877
00:53:34.180 --> 00:53:37.470
alright, you know, purple and black does a decent colors. Man,

878
00:53:37.471 --> 00:53:41.610
I liked those Wisconsin. I'm looking at all these fatties from Wisconsin,

879
00:53:42.440 --> 00:53:46.530
you know, walking around just horrible,

880
00:53:47.190 --> 00:53:48.750
horrible shape. I think when, you know,

881
00:53:48.751 --> 00:53:53.550
when Europeans look in America and they think of of the fat fucks, you know,

882
00:53:53.551 --> 00:53:54.690
I think, I don't know.

883
00:53:54.720 --> 00:53:59.580
I think they send away for a Wisconsin broach university brochure every year.

884
00:54:00.720 --> 00:54:05.310
I don't know what, because Jesus Christ, those were some healthy fucking people.

885
00:54:06.390 --> 00:54:06.781
All right?

886
00:54:06.781 --> 00:54:11.040
Evidently the recession has not hit Wisconsin yet because those people have

887
00:54:11.041 --> 00:54:14.360
plenty of money for extra food. So anyway,

888
00:54:14.361 --> 00:54:18.570
so I'm sitting there and we start to walk into the game, right?

889
00:54:19.170 --> 00:54:20.650
Me and three of my buddies were all good,

890
00:54:20.750 --> 00:54:22.290
and I don't name names on this fucking thing.

891
00:54:22.290 --> 00:54:26.520
We go to walk into this goddamn thing and I start looking around after, oh,

892
00:54:26.521 --> 00:54:29.970
after a wonderful tailgate. We really did it up this year.

893
00:54:30.390 --> 00:54:34.590
Plenty of booze. And which I did not partake in.

894
00:54:34.591 --> 00:54:38.880
I brought a 12 pack of water. Go ahead, email me, call me a fag.

895
00:54:38.910 --> 00:54:43.110
I don't give a fuck. I feel great. You fucking cuts. Look at,

896
00:54:43.111 --> 00:54:47.250
I'm still defensive about it, you know, at least I'm one of those, those, those,

897
00:54:47.251 --> 00:54:50.190
I'm not a preachy sober person. I'm not going like, you know,

898
00:54:51.330 --> 00:54:53.430
why do you do that? What are you, what are you running from?

899
00:54:53.431 --> 00:54:55.380
I know why you're doing it. Cause it's fucking fun.

900
00:54:55.470 --> 00:54:58.680
And I'd still be doing it if my head didn't get three times the size of its

901
00:54:58.681 --> 00:55:00.210
usual enormous size.

902
00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:06.200
You know my head when I'm not boozing looks like one of the moons of Jupiter.

903
00:55:06.360 --> 00:55:07.350
Okay. I don't,

904
00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:12.900
I don't need to continue adding to it, you know,

905
00:55:12.901 --> 00:55:16.680
and then have it be like Pluto and then scientists can fucking debate on whether

906
00:55:16.681 --> 00:55:19.560
or not it's a fucking planet. All right. The fucking fucking fucking,

907
00:55:19.740 --> 00:55:24.150
there you go. See I needed the help there. The F word for me is,

908
00:55:24.151 --> 00:55:27.360
is my, my uh, uh, what are those things?

909
00:55:27.900 --> 00:55:30.600
The HGH of my fucking comedy. All right.

910
00:55:30.601 --> 00:55:34.200
And I'll continue to use it and I don't give a shit cause they're not banned in

911
00:55:34.201 --> 00:55:38.760
my industry. Um, anyways, so what was I saying? Right.

912
00:55:38.920 --> 00:55:42.180
So we had a great tailgate. We show up. I became in the backway this,

913
00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:45.420
this this year. All right. We parked right along the fence.

914
00:55:46.050 --> 00:55:49.110
We right near the clubhouse on the golf course and then you can,

915
00:55:49.111 --> 00:55:51.840
I could literally see one of the lights, you know that lights up the stadium,

916
00:55:51.841 --> 00:55:54.180
so we were right there. There was no way we were getting lost this year.

917
00:55:54.480 --> 00:55:58.830
Actually brought a frying pan, brought some eggs. We had burgers,

918
00:55:59.790 --> 00:56:04.320
hotdogs, steak. We had shit to throw in the omelets. Cheese,

919
00:56:04.350 --> 00:56:07.860
everything you want. We had a spatula. We brought tongs. We had napkins.

920
00:56:07.861 --> 00:56:09.690
We had a fucking garbage bag.

921
00:56:10.890 --> 00:56:15.540
We had a grill bag of charcoal, four bags of fucking ice. A cool.

922
00:56:15.541 --> 00:56:16.374
We had every tick.

923
00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:22.900
We had fucking corn chips. We had salsa. We had two bottles, a

924
00:56:24.350 --> 00:56:29.050
<v 7>Ho jar, a fucking pickles catch up. We had everything we had.</v>

925
00:56:29.051 --> 00:56:33.040
We had, we had real forks and steak knives for the stakes.

926
00:56:33.041 --> 00:56:38.041
We had everything except for a fucking table.

927
00:56:40.130 --> 00:56:40.963
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

928
00:56:42.920 --> 00:56:47.870
<v 7>God, next year is going to be the per every year two bottles of crown royal.</v>

929
00:56:47.930 --> 00:56:50.690
A case of fucking beer. We will ready to go.

930
00:56:50.691 --> 00:56:53.270
We even had orange juice for the fucking eggs.

931
00:56:54.940 --> 00:56:58.210
We will ready to go and we forgot a God damn table.

932
00:56:58.870 --> 00:57:01.900
This is one of the ways we start the day off with one of the best fucking

933
00:57:02.260 --> 00:57:02.261
omelettes.

934
00:57:02.261 --> 00:57:05.680
You ever going to have new year's Day sitting on a golf course on a sunny day,

935
00:57:05.840 --> 00:57:07.510
no one, the rest of the Goddamn country,

936
00:57:07.530 --> 00:57:12.220
Snowden screaming at some ticket agent that they got to get back to Albuquerque

937
00:57:12.221 --> 00:57:15.820
before they yak. You know, shits the bed, right?

938
00:57:18.440 --> 00:57:21.980
You forgot a God damn table, which isn't bad when you eat an almond,

939
00:57:22.010 --> 00:57:25.250
but when you're eating a fucking steak that's an inch and a half thick that's

940
00:57:25.251 --> 00:57:28.700
been cooked at best rare,

941
00:57:30.500 --> 00:57:34.010
it's supposed to be medium rare. Okay? It was,

942
00:57:34.040 --> 00:57:36.230
it was just medium rare.

943
00:57:36.650 --> 00:57:40.880
What happens is you got it on a paper plate and as you use pressure to cut into

944
00:57:40.881 --> 00:57:45.610
that, it creases in the middle and you see this puddle of,

945
00:57:45.640 --> 00:57:47.980
of, of grease. It just starts coming.

946
00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:49.910
It comes close to your balls and then it goes away.

947
00:57:49.911 --> 00:57:53.780
Just like the tide coming in and you sitting there going, you know,

948
00:57:53.781 --> 00:57:57.170
I really should. I just drip the rest of this grease down into the grass,

949
00:57:58.070 --> 00:58:01.700
kill a couple of lady bugs and then continue on with the eating process.

950
00:58:01.701 --> 00:58:03.620
But it tastes so fucking good. You Go, you know what?

951
00:58:03.621 --> 00:58:05.990
I think I can do it one more time and then you do it.

952
00:58:05.991 --> 00:58:09.800
What happens if fucking rolls right off onto your jeans and you haven't noticed?

953
00:58:10.400 --> 00:58:11.360
I don't give a fuck.

954
00:58:12.280 --> 00:58:12.540
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

955
00:58:12.540 --> 00:58:14.490
<v 7>What you spill, where you spell it.</v>

956
00:58:14.491 --> 00:58:18.120
You could have your arms outstretched if you spill any sort of liquid.

957
00:58:18.510 --> 00:58:20.360
It not only does it land in your Crotch,

958
00:58:20.361 --> 00:58:22.200
it lands right at the head of your Dick.

959
00:58:22.230 --> 00:58:25.260
So it always looks like you pissed your pants. So that's what I look like.

960
00:58:25.261 --> 00:58:28.200
I had grease on the front of my pants. Um,

961
00:58:29.130 --> 00:58:32.340
I mean while I'm sitting here watching all these Wisconsin fans walking around

962
00:58:32.341 --> 00:58:35.940
and they got these candy striped fucking overalls,

963
00:58:36.180 --> 00:58:38.160
they look like Richard Simmons shorts.

964
00:58:38.430 --> 00:58:42.900
If you fucking mugged him and cleaned out his closet of early eighties fucking

965
00:58:43.350 --> 00:58:46.830
gay, his running shorts ever. And you somehow turned him into overalls,

966
00:58:46.860 --> 00:58:49.590
you know, be wanting of women were wearing them. That be kind of hot, right?

967
00:58:50.190 --> 00:58:51.880
But there was a bunch of guys wearing them to the,

968
00:58:51.930 --> 00:58:54.960
they all look like they look like it looked like a jugglers convention.

969
00:58:55.650 --> 00:58:57.690
It's the best way to put it. So I'm sitting there going, man,

970
00:58:57.691 --> 00:59:01.110
I liked the big 10, I want to root for Wisconsin. Then every once in a while,

971
00:59:01.260 --> 00:59:05.400
because it seemed to be like 80%, 75%, maybe 70,

972
00:59:05.401 --> 00:59:08.790
a at the smallest Wisconsin fans. And then TCU, so you know,

973
00:59:09.570 --> 00:59:14.370
who doesn't like an underdog? So I start walking towards the stadium, right?

974
00:59:14.400 --> 00:59:18.630
And, uh, I'm thinking I'm gonna go for TCU. Fuck this. I helped this little,

975
00:59:19.530 --> 00:59:24.260
uh, mountain west, whatever fucking I didn't know conference it from, Huh,

976
00:59:25.380 --> 00:59:28.080
I hope these guys win. And, uh,

977
00:59:28.970 --> 00:59:31.160
I start going up to the stadium and, uh,

978
00:59:31.161 --> 00:59:34.730
one of my buddies elbows me and he turned around and he points to these TCU fans

979
00:59:34.731 --> 00:59:38.870
and this guy is wearing brown loafers,

980
00:59:39.980 --> 00:59:41.810
these light purple, uh,

981
00:59:41.870 --> 00:59:46.870
like corduroy dockers with the TCU emblem and then like a v Neck sweater

982
00:59:49.740 --> 00:59:53.940
and like these ray bond, fucking risky business sunglasses on.

983
00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:58.220
And He, I like if you,

984
00:59:58.221 --> 01:00:01.700
if you were casting a movie, do you guys see Facebook,

985
01:00:01.701 --> 01:00:04.760
that Facebook social network? Do you know how like the Harvard guys,

986
01:00:04.940 --> 01:00:07.220
where this is what this guy looked like? And I was like, oh my God,

987
01:00:07.250 --> 01:00:08.083
are you serious?

988
01:00:09.390 --> 01:00:14.390
Is this guy an anomaly or is this really what TCU was all about?

989
01:00:15.640 --> 01:00:18.360
My buddy literally goes to me, he goes, that's it. I'm rooting for Wisconsin.

990
01:00:19.110 --> 01:00:22.140
You know, I look at this fucking guy and I, and I was sitting there going,

991
01:00:22.141 --> 01:00:26.070
you know what? I think he's right. Nah, maybe it's just, just one fucking guy.

992
01:00:26.190 --> 01:00:27.330
And then I see another guy,

993
01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:32.480
he has on a purple fucking blazer with gold buttons,

994
01:00:34.020 --> 01:00:38.400
a white shirt, some polluted slugs and low first

995
01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:43.790
<v 2>to the game. And all of a sudden I started looking at these, this,</v>

996
01:00:43.850 --> 01:00:47.560
not all of them, but a good 15% of them are dressed this way,

997
01:00:48.010 --> 01:00:52.720
looking like those rich kids who fucking, you know, uh, air quote,

998
01:00:52.721 --> 01:00:55.300
accidentally kill their date, you know,

999
01:00:56.200 --> 01:00:59.110
and then they say it was consensual because she wanted rough sex too.

1000
01:00:59.350 --> 01:01:01.930
And their daddy has enough fucking money to get them out of it.

1001
01:01:01.931 --> 01:01:05.560
That's what they started looking like. So I'm like, Holy Shit,

1002
01:01:06.580 --> 01:01:07.620
fuck this. I'm, I'm,

1003
01:01:07.630 --> 01:01:12.190
I'm rooting for Wisconsin now we're in the crush to get in the game and I look

1004
01:01:12.191 --> 01:01:17.191
in front of me and there's this pasty fat fuck Wisconsin fan in front of me.

1005
01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:20.220
What the Wisconsin had turned around and yeah,

1006
01:01:20.260 --> 01:01:22.810
<v 7>I dunno if it was dry skin or Eczema.</v>

1007
01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:28.150
He had a perfect band of it going around the back of his, you know,

1008
01:01:28.151 --> 01:01:32.920
his hairline at the back of his head and the flakes of it were on the back of

1009
01:01:32.921 --> 01:01:35.110
his sweatshirt. I know, I hope you're not eating.

1010
01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:39.660
<v 2>Okay. So I'm looking at him gone. Oh, horrified.</v>

1011
01:01:40.830 --> 01:01:44.120
Absolutely horrified. And then I'm turning around.

1012
01:01:44.130 --> 01:01:49.130
I'm looking at these fucking slack in a sport coat wearing douchebags and at

1013
01:01:49.561 --> 01:01:50.970
that point I didn't know who I was for.

1014
01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:54.510
I was actually hoping that during the flyover,

1015
01:01:54.520 --> 01:01:58.810
one of the jets would go into the crowd and they could just start all over

1016
01:01:58.811 --> 01:02:02.380
again. It was, it was horrific. Worst Group of fans I've seen.

1017
01:02:02.540 --> 01:02:03.770
<v 7>And in three years,</v>

1018
01:02:03.771 --> 01:02:07.400
granted I was sober this time and I could actually remember this.

1019
01:02:07.401 --> 01:02:11.090
So I go into the stadium, right? And, uh, Lo and behold,

1020
01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:16.100
I'm in the TCU section, right? And I'm like, okay,

1021
01:02:16.820 --> 01:02:21.520
uh, I dunno if I liked this and I just, and I'll sign it here.

1022
01:02:21.540 --> 01:02:22.180
Start here.

1023
01:02:22.180 --> 01:02:26.160
<v 2>Take say, Yay, this girl like three rows back, tastes Jay.</v>

1024
01:02:26.890 --> 01:02:30.490
You come on, come on frogs.

1025
01:02:31.630 --> 01:02:35.800
<v 7>And I go, frogs. They had the fuck it. I didn't know what they were.</v>

1026
01:02:36.630 --> 01:02:41.080
We've got to give it to Wisconsin. Badger is a bad ass fucking hammer. TCU Horn.

1027
01:02:41.650 --> 01:02:45.620
Frocks okay. And, and that their mascot, look,

1028
01:02:45.621 --> 01:02:49.400
I don't think it looks like something out of like the, that star wars bar scene,

1029
01:02:49.430 --> 01:02:53.120
you know, and again, let's go frau come on. Tasty.

1030
01:02:53.121 --> 01:02:57.590
You take, see you. And I'm looking at the girls and they, they,

1031
01:02:57.600 --> 01:03:02.410
they have their jeans tucked into their cowboy boots.

1032
01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:05.410
Like they're in that band, great white, you know,

1033
01:03:05.411 --> 01:03:09.790
and then on top they have like these dime store Dolly Parton cowboy hats on.

1034
01:03:09.791 --> 01:03:14.290
And I was like, oh my God, I fucking hate these people. And at that point,

1035
01:03:14.291 --> 01:03:17.680
and I was sitting right in the middle of them and I immediately just became a

1036
01:03:17.681 --> 01:03:20.920
Wisconsin Fan. Now in defense of TCU,

1037
01:03:20.980 --> 01:03:24.520
I think if I was hanging in the Wisconsin section, I would route,

1038
01:03:25.030 --> 01:03:29.390
I would have rooted for TCU. I would have ruled for TCU, you know,

1039
01:03:29.391 --> 01:03:32.090
in the middle of me just screaming that tacy g you come off frogs.

1040
01:03:32.091 --> 01:03:36.410
I can't tell if Nia just laughed or the guy downstairs yelled at me, oh,

1041
01:03:36.411 --> 01:03:40.900
that's a dark, oh, okay, my fault. Or it's Mel Blanc.

1042
01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:45.610
I'm good. Anybody imitate a dog barking better than that guy. Anyways,

1043
01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:50.950
let's plow ahead here. So then I just sat there and uh,

1044
01:03:50.980 --> 01:03:55.450
just was rooting for Wisconsin and I just wanted it and I, and I just,

1045
01:03:55.690 --> 01:03:58.210
another thing too that's really fucking annoying about TCU

1046
01:03:59.900 --> 01:04:00.733
<v 2>okay,</v>

1047
01:04:01.130 --> 01:04:05.540
is no matter what's going on during the game,

1048
01:04:05.570 --> 01:04:09.020
they have a reason to fucking put their hands in the air. See,

1049
01:04:09.050 --> 01:04:10.430
can't see the fucking game.

1050
01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:15.680
Anytime it was third down they had this gay little thing where you know you make

1051
01:04:15.681 --> 01:04:17.420
the a m o k sign.

1052
01:04:17.990 --> 01:04:22.640
They would do that signifying third down and then they would just sort of shake

1053
01:04:22.641 --> 01:04:27.641
their hands like you just in case you don't know what town it is and it

1054
01:04:28.010 --> 01:04:28.843
everybody.

1055
01:04:30.090 --> 01:04:33.780
So it's like third down at anybody who watches football knows third down is a

1056
01:04:33.781 --> 01:04:38.781
really important fucking down as a fan you played of paid a fuck load for the

1057
01:04:39.241 --> 01:04:39.601
ticket.

1058
01:04:39.601 --> 01:04:43.380
You want to see what happened and these fucking idiots are so busy going to the

1059
01:04:43.381 --> 01:04:46.530
loo. You couldn't see anything. Then, not to mention

1060
01:04:48.060 --> 01:04:51.420
this fat whore in front of me who from the size of her should have been a

1061
01:04:51.421 --> 01:04:55.140
Wisconsin fan, but then again I've been to Houston, Texas. Okay.

1062
01:04:55.170 --> 01:04:57.300
Those people like their barbecue to the,

1063
01:04:57.330 --> 01:04:59.940
these are the people that really make America look bad.

1064
01:04:59.941 --> 01:05:02.190
It's the fucking middle of the country. You got damn people.

1065
01:05:02.191 --> 01:05:04.620
I don't know what your problem is is because you're landlocked.

1066
01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:09.120
Don't they have swimming pools where you people could do a couple of laps people

1067
01:05:09.121 --> 01:05:13.650
on the coast or in shape. All right. Seattle. All the way down to San Diego.

1068
01:05:13.651 --> 01:05:17.170
These motherfuckers are in shape. Go ahead. Yeah.

1069
01:05:17.590 --> 01:05:22.480
San Diego grew right up to coast Los Angeles, San Francisco,

1070
01:05:23.500 --> 01:05:28.270
or a Portland, Oregon. They're in shape. A Seattle. They're in shape. Vancouver.

1071
01:05:28.300 --> 01:05:30.280
I even leave the country and they're fucking in shape.

1072
01:05:32.590 --> 01:05:36.040
You stopped getting out there in Nebraska, Iowa. Wisconsin.

1073
01:05:37.870 --> 01:05:38.703
Huh?

1074
01:05:38.940 --> 01:05:42.700
<v 7>It's fucking, people are, are, are horrific other than Florida.</v>

1075
01:05:42.701 --> 01:05:45.670
Florida doesn't count. All right. Florida is a, I don't know what it is.

1076
01:05:45.671 --> 01:05:47.980
It's like the ball bag, but he says, it looks like a dick to me.

1077
01:05:47.981 --> 01:05:52.600
It looks like a fucking 56 year old. Scroll up. Just hang in there.

1078
01:05:53.420 --> 01:05:57.980
I'm after the Dick got lopped off. Um, anyways, so they,

1079
01:05:57.990 --> 01:06:01.390
they handed out the like, like them doing that third down thing wasn't enough.

1080
01:06:01.391 --> 01:06:05.680
They handed out these fucking little purple like rags.

1081
01:06:05.950 --> 01:06:10.060
Okay. First of all, stealing from the Pittsburgh Steelers, the terrible towel.

1082
01:06:10.090 --> 01:06:13.660
They steal that and then on them it said fear the frog,

1083
01:06:13.930 --> 01:06:15.130
which they stole

1084
01:06:16.130 --> 01:06:19.820
<v 2>from a Maryland fear the turtle, right?</v>

1085
01:06:20.540 --> 01:06:24.440
The first school to actually admit that they have a bad name,

1086
01:06:24.650 --> 01:06:26.300
a bad mascot fucking name.

1087
01:06:27.350 --> 01:06:29.730
So then what they would this fucking fat whore

1088
01:06:29.850 --> 01:06:32.760
<v 7>in front of me. I swear to God. Every God damn play.</v>

1089
01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:34.570
<v 9>Yeah.</v>

1090
01:06:34.570 --> 01:06:37.000
<v 7>Okay. Her fucking team would be,</v>

1091
01:06:37.780 --> 01:06:42.430
we had ends on seats were was in the other end zone at Wisconsin's 10 yard line

1092
01:06:42.431 --> 01:06:45.820
trying to drive in for his score. Okay. They're there 90 yards away.

1093
01:06:45.821 --> 01:06:47.080
If you're standing on the goal line,

1094
01:06:47.081 --> 01:06:50.800
forget about being 40 50 fucking rose up in the goddamn stand.

1095
01:06:51.010 --> 01:06:55.140
And she would be sitting there as she's talking to a friend too.

1096
01:06:55.141 --> 01:06:57.510
That's what killed me. Classic, broad it again,

1097
01:06:57.660 --> 01:06:58.980
she's sitting there shooting the shit. You know,

1098
01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:02.910
she probably went there for the tournament of fucking roses and she just kept it

1099
01:07:02.911 --> 01:07:03.744
and I finally,

1100
01:07:04.860 --> 01:07:06.780
<v 2>I tapped her on her fleshy shoulder</v>

1101
01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:10.710
and she immediately took it as I was saying, put it down. I said,

1102
01:07:10.711 --> 01:07:15.150
can you just wave that? Can you wave it more in your like in front of you,

1103
01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:18.030
which this is the funniest thing ever.

1104
01:07:18.570 --> 01:07:22.260
She does and immediately realizes that when she does it,

1105
01:07:22.740 --> 01:07:27.390
she can't see the fucking game. Welcome to my world, you fat whore.

1106
01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:30.360
That's what I've been dealing with for the last three fucking quarters.

1107
01:07:31.320 --> 01:07:35.070
So then what she did was, is she then switched into her left hand. Okay.

1108
01:07:35.250 --> 01:07:39.540
Because not only is she a fat whore, she's a dumb fat whore. Okay.

1109
01:07:39.720 --> 01:07:42.000
In the first moment when I tapped her, she was like, oh,

1110
01:07:42.001 --> 01:07:44.970
this guy must be a Wisconsin fan, you know,

1111
01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:50.520
because he's telling me to put it down. Then she realizes, oh, it's in his way.

1112
01:07:52.070 --> 01:07:55.340
Then she waves it in front of her face and realizes, oh, now I can't see,

1113
01:07:55.430 --> 01:07:59.990
and you would think at that point light would dawn on our fucking fat head and

1114
01:07:59.991 --> 01:08:03.860
she'd be like, oh, I get it. If I waved this thing,

1115
01:08:04.130 --> 01:08:08.870
people behind me can't see the fucking game. Not this fat whore, not this one.

1116
01:08:09.890 --> 01:08:13.070
She fucking puts it in the left hand and starts waving like that.

1117
01:08:13.130 --> 01:08:16.160
Like that's the solution. Like she notice that

1118
01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:20.240
<v 7>there's another fucking 80,000 fans to her fucking lift up. It was the worst.</v>

1119
01:08:20.241 --> 01:08:22.420
And it's times like those where I just a

1120
01:08:23.930 --> 01:08:25.970
times like those were made for taster's choice.

1121
01:08:26.050 --> 01:08:29.840
You remember that coffee just brew up a Nice Hot Pot and you just dump it right

1122
01:08:29.841 --> 01:08:32.240
over her fucking head. That's what I would've liked in a perfect world.

1123
01:08:33.230 --> 01:08:37.820
And as she screamed from the scalding Burns,

1124
01:08:39.110 --> 01:08:41.780
um, she would collapse afterwards and maybe pass out either way,

1125
01:08:41.781 --> 01:08:44.570
she would be out of my way. And I got to tell you,

1126
01:08:44.571 --> 01:08:49.571
that would be the equivalent of three normal Americans who live on the coasts,

1127
01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:53.450
who live near the ocean. Hey, you know what?

1128
01:08:53.451 --> 01:08:55.640
I just realized that's how I'm gonna make my million dollars,

1129
01:08:56.450 --> 01:08:59.450
my multimillion dollars. So I compare a shoot out of this God damn business.

1130
01:08:59.451 --> 01:09:03.290
I've been trying to come up with, um,

1131
01:09:03.410 --> 01:09:07.400
some bullshit that I could sell for 1995 late at night. And I think I just did,

1132
01:09:08.510 --> 01:09:11.690
you know, I'm going to sell,

1133
01:09:13.420 --> 01:09:18.420
I'm going to sell a ocean water and little salt shakers for 1995.

1134
01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:24.790
That's what I'm going to do. And I'm just going to go, you know,

1135
01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:27.490
have you ever noticed how, you know,

1136
01:09:27.491 --> 01:09:31.300
people who live on the coast of this country or in shape, you know,

1137
01:09:31.301 --> 01:09:34.000
and now and now just show a bunch of good looking people running down the street

1138
01:09:34.001 --> 01:09:37.000
with their knees nice and high, like the Wisconsin fuckin marching band,

1139
01:09:37.001 --> 01:09:40.610
which was the shit, um,

1140
01:09:41.610 --> 01:09:44.340
just running down the fucking street, you know, high stepping it,

1141
01:09:45.300 --> 01:09:47.490
and then the white version of high stepping,

1142
01:09:47.580 --> 01:09:51.060
which is basically wring our knees up to our waist as opposed to the Grambling

1143
01:09:51.061 --> 01:09:54.360
black version where you basically, you know, you're,

1144
01:09:54.510 --> 01:09:58.350
you couldn't do it in a dome stadium because you would break your fucking toes.

1145
01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:03.333
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1146
01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:07.910
<v 7>Whenever black people were trying what try it anyways.</v>

1147
01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:12.950
So, uh, yeah, I would, I would sell that and I would just say,

1148
01:10:13.010 --> 01:10:14.330
and then you get, and if, you know,

1149
01:10:14.390 --> 01:10:16.400
are you tired of being fat in the middle of the country?

1150
01:10:16.401 --> 01:10:17.930
And just so somebody has sent a bun,

1151
01:10:18.260 --> 01:10:20.960
taking a bite out of it and then just looking at the camera like, you know,

1152
01:10:20.961 --> 01:10:25.310
throwing their arms up like, Ooh, yeah, I am sick of being a fat fuck. You know,

1153
01:10:25.400 --> 01:10:28.700
you know they have cinnabuns on the east coast. Why are on the West Coast?

1154
01:10:28.701 --> 01:10:31.640
Why aren't they fat fox? And I'll just, I just spin it.

1155
01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:36.760
It's because they live near the ocean and they're smelling that salt water in

1156
01:10:36.831 --> 01:10:39.800
the air. And I just make up a bunch of shit.

1157
01:10:39.830 --> 01:10:41.840
I'll pay off some fucking people in the FDA.

1158
01:10:42.540 --> 01:10:44.360
It doesn't seem like a hard thing to do,

1159
01:10:44.361 --> 01:10:46.670
considering half the drugs that get approved nowadays,

1160
01:10:46.671 --> 01:10:49.310
and I'll just say it's because of smelling salt water,

1161
01:10:49.311 --> 01:10:53.510
air that you're able to eat Cinnabon and shut off those fucking pounds.

1162
01:10:53.570 --> 01:10:56.150
And I'll sell it like little bottles of fucking colognes,

1163
01:10:56.151 --> 01:10:59.420
every fatty in the fucking Midwest and I'll make my money.

1164
01:11:00.380 --> 01:11:05.380
And then I'm going to move to Denmark and I'm going to pay 90% taxes yet have

1165
01:11:05.751 --> 01:11:10.550
free health insurance and a, you know, when a little vesper,

1166
01:11:10.820 --> 01:11:12.720
I'm going to go around those little fucking a

1167
01:11:14.730 --> 01:11:17.550
<v 2>little streets out there. I'm trying to put together a Scandinavian tour.</v>

1168
01:11:17.551 --> 01:11:22.050
By the way, this year. I'm really looking forward to that. Um, so there you go.

1169
01:11:22.110 --> 01:11:25.320
You know something like you, I also lost interest halfway through that.

1170
01:11:25.321 --> 01:11:30.270
So that was the rose bowl for me this year. I didn't drink. I had a,

1171
01:11:30.780 --> 01:11:35.110
uh, I had a fucking awesome time. I remember the game. Congratulations to tasty.

1172
01:11:36.690 --> 01:11:40.530
Let's go froward. Congratulations to you.

1173
01:11:40.531 --> 01:11:45.210
A horribly horribly dressed human beings just horribly dressed.

1174
01:11:46.140 --> 01:11:49.740
Trash, white trash is the only way to describe what I saw out there.

1175
01:11:49.741 --> 01:11:53.850
You guys really looked like you never left the Greater Dallas area.

1176
01:11:55.410 --> 01:11:56.850
Um, you know,

1177
01:11:56.851 --> 01:11:59.070
I'm going to go out on a limb here and I would say I'm never going to get an

1178
01:11:59.071 --> 01:12:00.690
opportunity to perform at that school.

1179
01:12:03.540 --> 01:12:06.930
And if I ever get an offer, I'm going to be really suspect of it,

1180
01:12:07.350 --> 01:12:10.080
thinking that they actually listened to this podcast. Oh my God,

1181
01:12:10.110 --> 01:12:14.070
the dime store fucking oh, every the woman,

1182
01:12:14.071 --> 01:12:16.380
women are dressed like the, that Dolly part movie,

1183
01:12:16.381 --> 01:12:19.230
best little whorehouse in Texas, except they were serious.

1184
01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:22.290
They probably put on my best hat for the s one.

1185
01:12:22.770 --> 01:12:26.060
I saw a guy actually took a picture of them or did they zoom into them?

1186
01:12:26.061 --> 01:12:30.330
I have some video, I've got to give it to my web guy. Um, of this guy.

1187
01:12:30.331 --> 01:12:35.331
He was dressed in a suit with a big black Stetson looking like fucking a j r

1188
01:12:36.361 --> 01:12:39.420
Ewing standing. You know, if it was the early eighties out,

1189
01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:42.990
well he would've looked good, you know, but it's fucking 2011, dude,

1190
01:12:42.991 --> 01:12:44.580
it's time to let that go.

1191
01:12:46.140 --> 01:12:49.020
You're fucking oil man slash coke dealer.

1192
01:12:49.950 --> 01:12:53.880
Look from fucking 1981 30 years later, you're still rocking.

1193
01:12:53.881 --> 01:12:57.450
That look like dead serious, dead serious.

1194
01:12:57.810 --> 01:13:01.320
These are the kinds of people that think like theirs. You can cure homosexuals,

1195
01:13:02.310 --> 01:13:06.240
you know, and uh, you know, like when those countries,

1196
01:13:06.241 --> 01:13:10.950
singers like need a hit, so they just write a song about how great America is.

1197
01:13:11.070 --> 01:13:11.903
And they're too,

1198
01:13:11.950 --> 01:13:15.070
<v 6>and the fans are too dumb to see through the fact that they're just trying to</v>

1199
01:13:15.071 --> 01:13:19.000
make money. Maybe it wasn't visible. Play the too far away.
