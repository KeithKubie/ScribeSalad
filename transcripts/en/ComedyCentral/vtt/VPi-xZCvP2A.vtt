Mr. President, we here,
we<i> mangia</i> together.

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:25.918
-Yeah.
-You understand? We all eat.

00:01:25.951 --> 00:01:27.920
-I'm not talking about food now.
-Okay.

00:01:27.953 --> 00:01:29.422
Hear what I'm trying
to tell you.

00:01:29.455 --> 00:01:30.957
Eat (bleep)?

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.558
No.
(chuckles)

00:01:32.591 --> 00:01:33.960
-Is that what we're saying?
-We don't do that.

00:01:33.993 --> 00:01:35.161
-We don't do that.
-No?

00:01:35.194 --> 00:01:36.496
-No. -No, no, no.
-Wait, good. Neither do I.

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:37.897
-No.
-Yeah.

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.432
-You want to be a good boss?
-I want to be a good boss.

00:01:39.465 --> 00:01:40.700
Everybody around you got to eat.

00:01:40.733 --> 00:01:43.169
Democrats, Republicans--
everybody got to eat.

00:01:43.202 --> 00:01:45.371
-I get it, I get it.
-You got it, you got it.

00:01:45.404 --> 00:01:46.772
Everybody needs to eat.

00:01:46.805 --> 00:01:49.375
But isn't it better
to hire a bunch of people,

00:01:49.408 --> 00:01:50.910
then you don't pay them,

00:01:50.943 --> 00:01:53.713
and then when they sue you,
you negotiate down the rate?

00:01:53.746 --> 00:01:55.181
-No, that's not what a good boss
does. -Not... No.

00:01:55.214 --> 00:01:56.782
-We don't do that.
-We don't do that.

00:01:56.815 --> 00:01:58.384
But that's, uh...
that's what I've done for years.

00:01:58.417 --> 00:02:00.720
-That's not a good boss then.
Eh... -See, if you-you did that

00:02:00.753 --> 00:02:02.722
-in our life, you won't last.
-No?

00:02:02.755 --> 00:02:04.590
-You'd be gone.
-Gone?

00:02:04.623 --> 00:02:07.460
<i> I felt like a regular schnook.</i>

00:02:07.493 --> 00:02:09.929
<i> Nevertheless, I persisted.</i>

00:02:09.962 --> 00:02:12.064
So what else
do I need to work on?

00:02:12.097 --> 00:02:13.733
I think you should be
a little low-key

00:02:13.766 --> 00:02:15.334
a little bit with your tweeting.

00:02:15.367 --> 00:02:17.470
-Yeah. -I tweeted today
that I'm meeting you guys.

00:02:17.503 --> 00:02:19.805
-No. -Did you, really?
No more tweets.

00:02:19.838 --> 00:02:21.607
-I got to tweet.
-No.

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.109
But I get so angry.

00:02:23.142 --> 00:02:25.244
And then I get worked up
and I go,

00:02:25.277 --> 00:02:27.113
"I got to say this right now."

00:02:27.146 --> 00:02:29.248
You can't let people know
what you're thinking, ever.

00:02:29.281 --> 00:02:30.917
Now, wait a minute,
you're saying

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.586
-I can't even use emoticons?
-No.

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:35.655
Not even the doody one
with the eyes?

00:02:35.688 --> 00:02:37.323
-Nothing.
-Not even the doody one.

00:02:37.356 --> 00:02:38.658
Nothing. Nothing.

00:02:38.691 --> 00:02:40.826
-Capisce?
-Capisce?

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:42.361
You know what this means,
"capisce"?

00:02:42.394 --> 00:02:43.896
I love a fresh capisce.

00:02:43.929 --> 00:02:46.232
Capisce, mozzarella,
a little bit of basil,

00:02:46.265 --> 00:02:48.234
some tomato,
and a focaccia roll?

00:02:48.267 --> 00:02:51.571
-No. No capisce. No capisce.
-(laughing) -I don't understand.

00:02:51.604 --> 00:02:54.840
<i> What did they think?
 I was funny? I was a clown?</i>

00:02:54.873 --> 00:02:57.777
<i> Well, clowns</i> are<i> funny.</i>

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.979
<i> I knew
 I had earned their respect.</i>

00:03:00.012 --> 00:03:02.114
I'm worried. He's got too many
leaks in the White House.

00:03:02.147 --> 00:03:04.116
-Got leaks. -Got a lot of leaks.
-This is big issue.

00:03:04.149 --> 00:03:07.186
This is with Comey. You know
about Comey, the FBI director?

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:09.589
What's this thing you talked
to him about? The thing.

00:03:09.622 --> 00:03:11.724
Well, the thing was,
I said, "Listen,

00:03:11.757 --> 00:03:13.159
you're gonna lay off, right?"

00:03:13.192 --> 00:03:15.161
-I just said,
"You're gonna lay off." -Mm-hmm.

00:03:15.194 --> 00:03:16.996
-You know what I'm saying.
-I know what you're saying.

00:03:17.029 --> 00:03:18.197
He didn't get it at all.

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.266
I think you should've fired him
right away.

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:22.535
-In the beginning.
-Never trust the FBI.

00:03:22.568 --> 00:03:24.003
-Never trust 'em.
-Never trust...

00:03:24.036 --> 00:03:27.206
-Yeah, that's the first rule.
-I can't stand the FBI.

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:30.009
The FBI is a bunch of jerks.

00:03:30.042 --> 00:03:32.478
-You can tell he was hanging out
with us. -Yeah.

00:03:32.511 --> 00:03:34.614
-His father had a lot
of good friends. -Yeah.

00:03:34.647 --> 00:03:37.617
Oh, yeah. Who were some
of my father's friends?

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.785
-(chuckling) -We don't say.
We don't say. -No?

00:03:39.818 --> 00:03:41.053
You can't share that?

00:03:41.086 --> 00:03:43.055
<i> Daddy helps me out once again.</i>

00:03:43.088 --> 00:03:44.790
<i> We have so much in common.</i>

00:03:44.823 --> 00:03:48.060
<i> My paisans, my P'Zones.</i>

00:03:48.093 --> 00:03:49.895
So what else do I need?
Is there anything else

00:03:49.928 --> 00:03:51.397
that I need that I'm missing?

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.399
You're listening? Pay attention.

00:03:53.432 --> 00:03:56.335
-See, everything we do,
it's about<i> famiglia.</i> -Right.

00:03:56.368 --> 00:03:57.870
-Everything.
-I think it's important

00:03:57.903 --> 00:04:00.806
to keep your family close.
But what about Melania?

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:03.809
-What if I want a new wife?
-No. No. -Mm. You can't.

00:04:03.842 --> 00:04:06.412
You don't understand. We were
never allowed to get divorced.

00:04:06.445 --> 00:04:08.614
-That's a rule.
-What? Are you kidding me?

00:04:08.647 --> 00:04:11.217
-No divorcing. -Well, how did
you, you know, have fun?

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.019
Well, you had your goomah
on the side.

00:04:13.052 --> 00:04:14.420
-Yeah, friends with benefits.
-Goomah. That's how you say it.

00:04:14.453 --> 00:04:16.489
-A goomah. A friend with
benefits? -A goomah on the side.

00:04:16.522 --> 00:04:18.090
Friend with benefits.
That's what you got to get.

00:04:18.123 --> 00:04:21.093
So, like my daughter?

00:04:21.126 --> 00:04:23.896
-What'd he just say?
-No. Shame on you.

00:04:23.929 --> 00:04:26.299
-You think it's time to go?
-Yeah, it's gonna take a lot

00:04:26.332 --> 00:04:28.167
-of work. -I think it's time.
I think it's time. I'm done.

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.103
<i> Having paid their respects,
 they decided to leave.</i>

00:04:31.136 --> 00:04:35.374
<i> But for those four and a half
 minutes, we were kings.</i>

00:04:35.407 --> 00:04:37.043
No, we think you were good.
You're good.

00:04:37.076 --> 00:04:38.778
-You can tell he was
hanging out with us. -Yeah.

00:04:38.811 --> 00:04:41.314
-You have the power now.
-Shame on you.

00:04:41.347 --> 00:04:44.817
<i> You know what else
 is made in America? Me.</i>

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:46.316
<i> The Don... ald Trump.</i>
