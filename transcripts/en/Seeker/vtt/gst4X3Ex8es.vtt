00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.470
They say that weed makes you more creative,
which is true if we’re talking about inventing

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:11.010
an oreo-banana-skittle sandwich.

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.290
Hello someone who isn’t me, Jules here for
DNews.

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:15.850
Drugs are a mixed dime bag.

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:17.560
On the one hand, they get you high.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.880
On the other hand, they come with a bottomless
list of side effects.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.360
From heroin to coffee, drugs are drugs because
they change something about you, whether it

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.970
be your level of pain, your mood, your decision
making skills, and so on.

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.329
But one of the big effects commonly associated
with various drugs, like marijuana or alcohol,

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.970
is that they make you more creative.

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.430
Stoners are quick to point out that even though
they might be too couch-locked to actually

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.309
pick up a paintbrush, they feel much more
creative when they’re high.

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:47.460
And a similar idea follows the consumption
of alcohol; Winston Churchill and others like

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.870
Mark Twain and Beethoven have espoused the
idea that it’s important to get drunk before

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.679
embarking on anything creative.

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:58.780
Clearly, Churchill, Twain, and Beethoven have
proved their aptitude for creativity, so does

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:59.960
that prove them right?

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.809
Well, interestingly, it might.

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:07.479
In 2004, a study at the University of Colorado
found that about 15% of Caucasians carried

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:10.960
a genetic variant that changed the way they
responded to alcohol when compared to the

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.330
rest of the population.

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.600
This so-called “Churchill gene” made them
react more strongly in mood and behavior.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.610
Those with the gene reported feeling happiness
and elation after taking a shot of alcohol.

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.899
Sorry, let me clarify: participants were literally
injected with alcohol so that absorption rates

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:26.899
were consistent.

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:28.229
Don’t try that at home.

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.240
Anyway, this shot was followed by a period
of relaxation and creativity.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.979
In those without the gene, this creativity
was not as amplified, and on an aside, those

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:41.229
with the Churchill gene were much more likely
to end up with alcohol problems, like alcoholism.

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:46.039
But for those with and without the Churchill
gene, being drunk can make you FEEL more creative,

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:47.039
even if you aren’t.

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:51.619
That’s because alcohol inhibits brain activity,
which can lower judgement of your own creative

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:52.619
pursuits.

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.780
So, you might feel like a genius in the moment,
but in the morning, you’ll probably be disappointed.

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:57.780
And hungover.

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.430
Now, there is some evidence to show that a
small amount of alcohol can promote creative

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:02.430
thinking.

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.890
In 2012 a study was published by the University
of Chicago, wherein participants had a blood

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.900
alcohol level of .075, which in the United
States, is just shy of the .08 that is considered

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:12.930
legally drunk.

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.200
They were asked to find word pairs based on
three given words.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.739
So, given “arm” “peach” and “tar”,
a correct answer would be something like “pit”,

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.000
creating arm pit, peach pit, and tar pit.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.590
When compared to their sober counterparts,
the drunk group was able to think of more

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.970
answers, faster answers, and more insightful
answers.

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.519
So that’s alcohol, but how about Ganja?

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:33.519
Dank?

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:34.519
Herb?

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:35.519
Chron?

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:36.519
Kush?

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:37.519
The Devil’s Lettuce?

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:38.519
What about weed?

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:41.959
Just based on the hundreds of different names
for it, it MUST make you more creative right?

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:46.300
Well, a study from The Netherlands attempted
to classify “creativity” as divergent

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.879
thinking -- the ability to brainstorm, think
flexibly, and come up with new solutions to

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:51.879
problems.

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:55.280
In this case, participants were given two
objects (like a shoe and a pen) and asked

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.400
to come up with new uses for them.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.269
Using this criteria, they found that when
participants inhaled a low dose of cannabis

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:03.560
there was almost no effect on creativity.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.070
When they took high doses, researchers found
that their creativity actually plummeted.

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:12.500
But perhaps more interestingly, instead of
being linked to actual drug use, creativity

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.170
seems to be linked to expected drug use.

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.390
Another study found that when participants
were tricked into thinking they’d eaten

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.560
a marijuana laced biscuit, they showed more
creativity than participants who hadn’t

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.599
eaten any biscuits at all.

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:27.860
Unsurprisingly, the placebo effect still works.

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.680
So depending on your definition of creativity,
having a beer or two could make you a little

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.480
more creative, Churchill gene or not.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.160
And for you potheads out there: you’re only
more creative because you think you are.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.250
And if you’re high enough, that last sentence
should keep you busy for the next seven hours,

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.159
or however many minutes that is.

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:46.400
But if you are creative, on drugs or not,
you probably like listening to music.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.730
So if you’re looking for a new Bluetooth
speaker, check out Monster’s reimagined

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.140
boombox, the Monster Blaster.

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.170
It’s available for monthly payments starting
at $25.

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.830
The Monster Blaster has the power to bring
music to life indoors and out.

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:00.480
Check it out at themonsterblaster.com/dnews.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.280
And for all you potheads out there, you might've
heard that marijuana is stronger now than

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:05.959
it used to be decades ago.

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:07.019
But why is that?

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:08.019
Find out in this video.

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:11.890
THC is also the thing that gives marijuana,
well, its high and euphoric feeling.

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.819
Basically, the more THC the pot has, the stronger
the high.

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:18.810
Potency has been monitored for about 40 years,
but the rumor is lately, that today's pot

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.280
boasts more THC than in prior years.

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:22.280
So what do you think?

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.530
Are there other drugs that might boost creativity?
