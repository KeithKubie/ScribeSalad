Do you have a favorite?

00:00:09.108 --> 00:00:12.412 size:66% position:33%
The quieter one
with the sugar daddy.

00:00:12.445 --> 00:00:15.148 align:start position:0%
The sugar daddy got nothing
to [bleep] do with me.

00:00:15.181 --> 00:00:18.484 align:end position:100%
$800 seems like a lot
for a radio, but I don't know.

00:00:18.517 --> 00:00:22.655
Hey, how about we give...$400?

00:00:22.688 --> 00:00:24.390 align:start size:41% position:59%
Really?

00:00:24.423 --> 00:00:26.526 size:69% position:34% line:83%
What year was the car?
We never found out.

00:00:24.423 --> 00:00:26.526 align:start size:59% position:41%
Cut it in half.

00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:28.361 size:81% position:59%
Oh, dude,
I got the info right here.

00:00:28.394 --> 00:00:29.629 align:start position:0%
All right, let's see.

00:00:29.662 --> 00:00:33.266 align:end position:100%
Here. Well, see this first
if it's your pleasure.

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:34.734 align:start size:94% position:6%
What's the info?

00:00:34.767 --> 00:00:36.402 align:start size:59% position:41%
Got it right here.

00:00:36.435 --> 00:00:37.904
[ Lighter clicks ]

00:00:37.937 --> 00:00:40.573 size:75% position:63%
Wait,
what are we looking for?

00:00:40.606 --> 00:00:43.676 align:end position:100%
I'm gonna need some more
of that thinking...

00:00:43.709 --> 00:00:45.412 align:start size:88% position:13% line:85%
So it's $800.

00:00:43.709 --> 00:00:45.412 align:start size:66% position:34%
...thinking powder.

00:00:46.745 --> 00:00:47.713 align:start size:41% position:59%
Bingo.

00:00:47.746 --> 00:00:49.248 align:start position:0%
Is this a stock radio?

00:00:49.281 --> 00:00:51.451 align:start position:0%
Is it an aftermarket?

00:00:51.484 --> 00:00:55.054 size:63% position:31%
Wear and tear,
bad music, you know.

00:00:55.087 --> 00:00:57.824 size:66% position:33%
[Bleep]
$400.

00:00:57.857 --> 00:00:59.992 align:start size:88% position:13%
Case closed.

00:01:00.025 --> 00:01:01.828 align:start position:0%
If not, they're gonna
argue out there for two hours.

00:01:01.861 --> 00:01:03.696
We don't have the time today,
Your Honor.

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:05.498 align:start position:0%
We got a full [bleep] docket.
You know what I'm saying?

00:01:05.531 --> 00:01:07.233 size:72% position:64% line:83%
I know.
I like that expression.

00:01:05.531 --> 00:01:07.233 size:78% position:39%
We got a full docket...

00:01:07.266 --> 00:01:08.968 align:start size:50% position:50% line:78%
"Full docket."

00:01:07.266 --> 00:01:08.968 size:78% position:39%
...and a big, ol' [bleep]
jar of reefer,

00:01:09.001 --> 00:01:12.138 align:start size:84% position:16% line:78%
so [bleep]

00:01:09.001 --> 00:01:12.138 align:end position:100%
"We got a full docket
and a big jar of reefer."

00:01:12.171 --> 00:01:15.675 align:start size:78% position:22%
It's 60 miles to Chicago.

00:01:15.708 --> 00:01:17.977
It's dark,
and we're wearing sunglasses.

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.214 align:end position:100%
It was more than 60 miles
in "Blues Brothers," wasn't it?

00:01:21.247 --> 00:01:22.315 align:start size:94% position:6%
I don't remember.

00:01:22.348 --> 00:01:24.881
Yeah, it was a lot more miles,
I think.
