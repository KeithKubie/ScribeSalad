00:00:00.452 --> 00:00:02.228
- So we have a polynomial here.

00:00:02.228 --> 00:00:04.848
What I'm curious about
is what is the remainder

00:00:04.848 --> 00:00:08.133
if I were to divide this polynomial by,

00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:13.133
let's just say, x minus,
I want the remainder

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.102
when I divide this
polynomial by x minus two?

00:00:19.933 --> 00:00:21.017
You could do this.

00:00:21.017 --> 00:00:22.921
You could figure this out with algebraic

00:00:22.921 --> 00:00:24.580
long division, but I'll give you a hint.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.798
It is much simpler and
much less computation

00:00:26.798 --> 00:00:28.679
intensive and takes much less space

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:30.397
on your paper if you use

00:00:30.397 --> 00:00:32.256
the polynomial remainder theorem.

00:00:32.256 --> 00:00:34.775
If that's unfamiliar to
you, there's other videos

00:00:34.775 --> 00:00:36.425
that actually cover that.

00:00:36.425 --> 00:00:38.259
So why don't you have a go at it.

00:00:38.259 --> 00:00:41.409
All right, so now let's
work through this together.

00:00:41.409 --> 00:00:43.147
The polynomial remainder theorem tells us

00:00:43.147 --> 00:00:48.147
that when I take a polynomial, p of x,

00:00:50.484 --> 00:00:55.484
and if I were to divide
it by an x minus a,

00:00:56.578 --> 00:01:01.578
the remainder of that is just going

00:01:01.687 --> 00:01:03.904
to be equal to p of a.

00:01:04.427 --> 00:01:09.427
Is just going to be equal to p of a.

00:01:10.458 --> 00:01:12.535
So in this case, our p of x is this.

00:01:12.535 --> 00:01:13.825
What is our a?

00:01:13.825 --> 00:01:15.863
Well our a is going to be positive two.

00:01:15.863 --> 00:01:18.347
Remember it's x minus a.

00:01:18.347 --> 00:01:19.593
So let me do this.

00:01:19.593 --> 00:01:23.259
Our a is equal to positive two.

00:01:23.413 --> 00:01:24.307
So to figure out the remainder,

00:01:24.307 --> 00:01:27.354
we just have to evaluate p of two.

00:01:27.354 --> 00:01:28.389
So let's do that.

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.488
So the remainder in this case

00:01:32.488 --> 00:01:37.488
is going to be equal to p of two,

00:01:40.905 --> 00:01:44.225
which is equal to, so let's see,

00:01:44.225 --> 00:01:46.419
it's going to be, I'll
just do it all in magenta,

00:01:46.419 --> 00:01:51.419
negative three times
eight minus, let's see,

00:01:52.038 --> 00:01:57.038
minus four times four plus 20 minus seven.

00:01:58.872 --> 00:02:03.810
So let's see, this is -24 minus 16

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.349
plus 20 minus seven.

00:02:09.001 --> 00:02:13.575
So that gives us, let's see, -24 minus 16,

00:02:13.575 --> 00:02:15.315
this is -40.

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.250
All right, I'm just doing it step by step.

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.212
This is equal to negative,
actually I can do

00:02:19.212 --> 00:02:20.264
this in my head.

00:02:20.264 --> 00:02:21.437
All right, here we go.

00:02:21.437 --> 00:02:26.437
So this is -40 plus 20 is
-20 minus seven is -27.

00:02:30.435 --> 00:02:35.232
That was pretty neat
because if we attempted

00:02:35.232 --> 00:02:38.530
to do this without the
polynomial remainder theorem,

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.630
we would have had to do a bunch

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:41.753
of algebraic long division.

00:02:41.753 --> 00:02:43.342
Now if we did the algebraic long division,

00:02:43.342 --> 00:02:44.979
we would have gotten the
quotient and all of that,

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:47.022
but we don't need the quotient,

00:02:47.022 --> 00:02:48.543
we don't need to know.

00:02:48.543 --> 00:02:50.482
So if we did all the
algebraic long division,

00:02:50.482 --> 00:02:53.337
you know, we would have taken our p of x

00:02:53.337 --> 00:02:55.938
and then we would have
divided the x minus a

00:02:55.938 --> 00:03:00.938
into it, and we would have
gotten a quotient here,

00:03:03.495 --> 00:03:05.202
q of x, and we would have done all this

00:03:05.202 --> 00:03:07.399
business down here, all this
algebraic long division.

00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:09.234
Probably wouldn't have
even fit on the page.

00:03:09.234 --> 00:03:11.671
But eventually we would
have gotten to a point

00:03:11.671 --> 00:03:12.798
where we got an expression that has

00:03:12.798 --> 00:03:14.098
a lower degree than this.

00:03:14.098 --> 00:03:15.650
It would have to be a
constant because this is

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:17.262
a 1st degree, so it
would have be essentially

00:03:17.262 --> 00:03:18.550
a zero degree.

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.849
So we would have eventually
gotten to our -27.

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:24.217
But this was much, much, much, much easier

00:03:24.217 --> 00:03:28.199
then having to go through
this entire exercise.

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:30.020
Hopefully you appreciated that.
