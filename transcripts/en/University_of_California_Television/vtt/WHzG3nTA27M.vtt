00:00:01.407 --> 00:00:03.907
(perky music)

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:31.840
- Welcome to a Conversation with History.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.890
I'm Harry Kreisler, of the Institute

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:35.460
of International Studies.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.150
Our guest today is Nobel
laureate Linus Pauling.

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.519
Dr. Pauling received the
Nobel Prize in chemistry

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:46.350
in 1954, and the Nobel
Peace Prize in 1963.

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.520
He is visiting the
Berkeley campus this week

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.890
to deliver the Hitchcock Lectures,

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.310
and our topic for today's discussion

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:58.450
is the peace movement in
historical perspective.

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:00.170
Dr. Pauling, welcome to Berkeley.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:01.500
- Well, thank you.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.350
- I wonder if you might for us recall

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.354
the early days of the peace movement

00:01:08.354 --> 00:01:11.420
right after the First World
War, of the Second World War.

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.218
You were a member of
Einstein's Emergency Committee

00:01:16.218 --> 00:01:20.410
of Atomic Scientists, one
of the really first efforts.

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.670
- That's right, I got interested

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.573
in world peace, really, in 1945.

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.840
I had been working during
the Second World War,

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.650
for a little while earlier than that,

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.650
a year or two earlier, on war projects.

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.470
I still was professor
chairman of the division

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.410
of chemistry and chemical engineering

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.600
in the California Institute of Technology,

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.800
but I had about 20 contracts with

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.570
the Office of Scientific
Research and Development.

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.730
Oppenheimer asked me to come to Los Alamos

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:59.810
as the head of the chemistry section

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.800
of the atomic bomb project,
and I decided not to do it.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.661
I had so much going on in Pasadena,

00:02:06.661 --> 00:02:10.320
including continuing teaching chemistry

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.700
and this large amount for our work.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.970
When the atomic bombs
were dropped, exploded

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.430
over Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945,

00:02:22.532 --> 00:02:27.090
I was very soon asked
by some service club,

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.009
Rotary Club in Hollywood, to talk about

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:35.785
nuclear fission, about the
nature of these weapons.

00:02:35.785 --> 00:02:39.890
I was able to do so because
I had not been connected

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.880
with the Atomic Energy Project

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.880
and had no classified
information about these weapons.

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.150
So I began giving talks to, popular talks

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.630
to groups of that sort, which
were purely educational,

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.890
descriptive in nature, with
little political content.

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.670
Rather soon, they began to
involve also an expression

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.860
of my own ideas, and I don't
remember just how early

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.210
it was that I was able
to quote Albert Einstein

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:18.210
as saying that now that a
single bomb, atomic bomb

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.900
can destroy a whole
city, and a single rocket

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.900
can lob it over, the time has
come when we must give up war,

00:03:31.277 --> 00:03:34.850
but then I was asked to
join the board of trustees

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.470
of the Einstein committee,
the Emergency Committee

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.890
of Atomic Scientists, which consisted

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.540
only of the board of trustees,
half a dozen scientists.

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.900
Albert Einstein as chairman,

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.650
and Harold Urey as vice chairman.

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.650
So every few months, I went
with my wife to Princeton

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:03.260
to a meeting of this board and later on,

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:09.720
I took, made, began making lecture tours

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.910
partially along with Leo Szilard.

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:17.017
We would show a film which
the committee had had made,

00:04:17.017 --> 00:04:20.360
probably the first film
about atomic bombs,

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:24.170
explaining what nuclear war
would be, just the little

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:27.890
atomic bombs, Hiroshima
and Nagasaki type then.

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:32.890
And Leo Szilard would give a
talk, and I would speak too

00:04:34.274 --> 00:04:37.153
about the necessity to understand

00:04:37.153 --> 00:04:39.410
what had happened in the world

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:43.820
now that the means of
waging war had changed

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:47.083
in such an astounding way.

00:04:47.083 --> 00:04:50.320
- And very early on, you
were advocating against

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.970
the production of the hydrogen
bomb, even in the late 40s.

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:56.330
- Well, tried, I opposed the construction

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.450
of the hydrogen bomb on the, I think,

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:04.010
rather reasonable grounds
that an ordinary atomic bomb

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:08.220
could destroy a whole city,
and even the biggest cities,

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:12.090
it could do much damage,
perhaps kill a million people

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:15.320
out of the 10 million in a large city,

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.240
and that there was no need to make,

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.590
to accelerate the arms
race by developing weapons

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:25.060
a thousand times more powerful.

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:28.420
- How important was
the fact that you were,

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:30.930
and had not really been
in government service?

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:34.460
Do you think that made
it easier for you to draw

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:38.530
some of these conclusions and
to speak publicly about them?

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:40.990
- Yes, well of course, I had, in a sense,

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:44.023
been in government service in the,

00:05:44.023 --> 00:05:48.920
I took leave one summer from
the Institute in order to go

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:51.780
to the Central Explosives
Research Laboratory.

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:52.893
- [Harry] This would
be during the war, or?

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:55.177
- During the war, during the war.

00:05:55.177 --> 00:05:58.170
And I had a large number
of government contracts

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:02.120
that I was responsible for,
but I didn't have classified

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:06.569
information about atomic bombs,
and I could talk about them

00:06:06.569 --> 00:06:09.230
as freely as I wanted, I thought.

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:14.230
After my first talk, I
think, the second day

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:19.380
after my first talk, an FBI
man turned up in my office

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:23.387
and said, "How did you,
who gave you information

00:06:23.387 --> 00:06:28.167
"about how much plutonium
or uranium-235 there is

00:06:28.167 --> 00:06:30.120
"in an atomic bomb?"

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:33.042
And I said, "Nobody, I figured it out."

00:06:33.042 --> 00:06:33.890
(Harry laughing)

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:37.180
So, I wasn't bothered thereafter,

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:40.060
but if I had had classified information,

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:44.160
we can see that I might
well have been restrained

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:47.930
from speaking in public about the need

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:52.930
to get control over war the
way that I was speaking.

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:55.260
- And over the next decade and a half,

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.700
both you and your wife were very active

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:00.370
in lecturing, in holding conferences

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:02.747
and petitioning the government

00:07:02.747 --> 00:07:05.930
and making known to the public, really,

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:08.810
the issues involved in these new weapons?

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:09.995
- Yes, that's right.

00:07:09.995 --> 00:07:14.420
My wife had been interested
in social, political

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:19.010
and economic problems ever
since she was a teenage girl.

00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:22.360
She used to argue with, in Salem, Oregon,

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:24.270
where she was going to high school,

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:27.580
with a friend of the
family, one of the judges

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:30.650
of the Oregon State Supreme Court,

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:35.030
of which my uncle became
a chief justice later on.

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:37.490
She didn't know him until after, look,

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:40.870
she did actually know him
before we were married.

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:44.913
He was a friend of her family
in Oregon City, Oregon.

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:50.150
- But she, I gather, was very supportive

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:52.790
and, in fact, would direct
a lot of her speeches

00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:56.100
to the women's perspective
on these issues, is that--

00:07:56.100 --> 00:08:00.967
- Yes, that's right, and
of course, I have said

00:08:02.442 --> 00:08:05.780
and I have to say that
I'm sure that if I had not

00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:10.780
married her, I would not have
had that aspect of my career

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:15.690
that I have had, of
working for world peace.

00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:20.570
It was her influence on me
and her continued support

00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:23.550
that caused me to continue.

00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:27.130
In fact, I have said that
during the McCarthy period,

00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:29.747
when many people, especially scientists

00:08:29.747 --> 00:08:33.053
who had been following
approximately the same course

00:08:33.053 --> 00:08:35.720
that I was following, gave up.

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:40.720
I continued, because I had to
retain the respect of my wife.

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:45.640
- And what drove her?

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:48.140
Was it her academic
background, or her kind

00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:50.760
of humanistic concerns
about the fate of the world?

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:54.170
- Well, I think largely,
her humanistic concerns.

00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:56.890
She had had some training as a chemist,

00:08:56.890 --> 00:08:59.820
and during the Second World War she worked

00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:04.820
for a couple of years as
assistant to Professor Haagen-Smit

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:09.170
on a war project of
developing guayule rubber.

00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:13.990
She worked as a chemist, but
her, and she had an interest,

00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:17.930
general interest, in
science and was very able,

00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:21.450
very smart, but she was really concerned

00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:26.450
about human beings, the humanistic concern

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:30.550
that she had was very great.

00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:34.880
- And in the lectures that you both gave,

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:37.863
they were very similar to
what we're seeing today

00:09:37.863 --> 00:09:41.530
being done by the Physicians
for Social Responsibility

00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:44.740
on a larger scale, I mean, an exposure

00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:48.240
of the public to, really,
the horrors of nuclear war

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:50.750
in ways that they had never seen.

00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:53.350
- Yes, but when you say on a larger scale,

00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:57.280
I'm not even sure of that,
because we gave hundreds

00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:59.230
of lectures about world peace.

00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:01.964
And there were other
people too, Norman Cousins

00:10:01.964 --> 00:10:04.620
giving a great number of lectures.

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:09.252
There was great activity
25 years ago in this field.

00:10:09.252 --> 00:10:12.400
- Right, and one of the petitions

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:15.430
that was signed by 52 Nobel Prize winners,

00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:20.207
the Mainau Document of July 15th, 1955,

00:10:20.207 --> 00:10:23.810
I noticed there was a
sentence that in the petition

00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:26.816
we think it is a delusion
if governments believe

00:10:26.816 --> 00:10:30.160
that they can avoid war for a long time

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:32.950
through the fear of these weapons.

00:10:32.950 --> 00:10:36.070
All nations must come to the decision

00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:39.810
to renounce force as a
final resort of policy.

00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:44.070
Was that a criticism of
deterrents of the notion

00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:46.720
of deterrence that was emerging, or--

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:50.350
- Well, it may be that it
was, I wasn't at Mainau

00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:54.850
that year, I have gone to
Mainau where their meetings

00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:58.970
of Nobel laureates from
time, every year, in fact.

00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:02.070
I wasn't there, I signed this statement,

00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:04.630
but I wasn't involved in writing it.

00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:07.960
I believe and I continue to believe

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:12.470
that the deterrent
effect of nuclear weapons

00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:13.493
is very important.

00:11:14.530 --> 00:11:19.530
Here, in 1961, the Soviet Union

00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:25.310
exploded in the atmosphere
a single three stage

00:11:25.530 --> 00:11:29.957
nuclear weapon that was a 60 megaton bomb

00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:36.890
with explosive power equal
to 60 million tons of TNT.

00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:42.570
That's 10 times the explosive
power of all of the bombs

00:11:42.570 --> 00:11:45.010
used in the whole of the Second World War,

00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:49.580
in this one explosion,
and these bombs exist

00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:52.203
by the thousands, not so many,

00:11:53.130 --> 00:11:56.300
I don't know that there are
any other 60 megaton bombs,

00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:58.280
because there's no target worthy of one,

00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:00.390
but there are 20 megaton bombs,

00:12:00.390 --> 00:12:03.630
and many one megaton bombs around,

00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:08.010
roughly equal to the Second
World War in a single bomb.

00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:13.010
The feeling that I had
and many other people,

00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:18.050
that the existence of these stockpiles

00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:22.240
of terribly destructive
weapons that if used

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:26.630
would certainly destroy
civilization as we know it

00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:29.400
and might well wipe out the human race,

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:33.220
meant that the great powers
must not get involved

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:35.640
in a war with one another.

00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:39.820
My own feeling, then
and now, is as expressed

00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:43.860
in the report by the Boston
Group, Philip Morrison

00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:47.680
and his associates,
and their report called

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:51.380
The Price of Defense,
issued about four years ago,

00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:56.380
is that the nuclear
deterrent should be reduced

00:12:56.590 --> 00:13:00.730
from its present completely insane level

00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:03.963
to a somewhat less irrational level.

00:13:05.310 --> 00:13:09.490
But I think we don't, we
shouldn't get rid of it entirely

00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:14.490
and tempt the great powers to
go back to old fashioned wars

00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:17.500
with one another, with
conventional weapons

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:21.540
and with 20 million people killed

00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:25.210
in the First World War, 40
million in the Second World War,

00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:29.950
perhaps 60 million or 80
million in the Third World War

00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:32.280
fought with conventional weapons.

00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:34.310
Why take that chance?

00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:37.470
Well, I believe in the nuclear deterrent,

00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:40.470
but it's just got out
of hand, and we continue

00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:45.280
to waste money on it
instead of stabilizing it.

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:46.730
- Were charges made against you

00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:49.080
that you were for unilateral disarmament?

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:52.200
I mean, in a public
debate, there tends to be

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:56.330
such a distortion of views
that are so different

00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:59.150
from the conventional wisdom,
as yours were in the 50s.

00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:03.260
- Yes, I think that there were some

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.710
irresponsible statements about me,

00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:08.130
to the effect that I was working

00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:11.723
for disarming the United States,

00:14:11.723 --> 00:14:15.910
that I was taken in by Soviet propaganda

00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:18.900
and that sort of thing, and, of course,

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:21.890
I was speaking out for awhile,

00:14:21.890 --> 00:14:26.890
contrary to the official opinion.

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:31.330
If we had had a dictatorship
in this country,

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:35.040
I might well have been
accused of the crime

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:39.970
of seditious libel, which is used

00:14:39.970 --> 00:14:43.090
in dictatorships to suppress criticism.

00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:47.380
Seditious libel consists
in making statements

00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:49.480
critical of government policy,

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:52.950
that's sedition in a dictatorship.

00:14:52.950 --> 00:14:57.950
Well, you know, when I was
awarded the Nobel Peace Prize

00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:03.740
in 1963, Life magazine
published an editorial

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:10.280
with the heading, A
Weird Insult from Norway,

00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:16.510
the Norwegian Nobel Committee
awards the Peace Prizes.

00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:21.080
Well, this, I think that
the writer of this editorial

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:24.610
thought that it was insulting
to give the Peace Prize

00:15:24.610 --> 00:15:27.570
to someone who advocated something

00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:29.540
that was not the official policy

00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:31.780
of the United States government.

00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:36.680
- And indeed, when you
circulated a '58 petition,

00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:39.820
which was signed by 2,000
American scientists,

00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:42.130
and I think 8,000 foreign scientists,

00:15:42.130 --> 00:15:45.166
from 49 different countries,
there was a government

00:15:45.166 --> 00:15:49.080
harassment, there was
harassment in the press of you

00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:52.050
for undertaking this effort, really,

00:15:52.050 --> 00:15:55.440
and charges of working
for the enemy, really,

00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:56.620
is that not correct?

00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:58.940
- Well, to some extent, yes.

00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:03.530
And I was given, I first announced

00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:08.530
that 2,000 American scientists
had signed the petition

00:16:08.610 --> 00:16:13.340
asking for a cessation of the testing

00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:16.300
of nuclear weapons in the atmosphere

00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:20.230
where they were liberating
radioactive fallout

00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:25.230
over the whole world that
would cause defective children

00:16:25.450 --> 00:16:29.920
to be born and to damage
living people too,

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:33.533
living human beings, causing
cancer and other diseases.

00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:39.390
We asked that the
nations make an agreement

00:16:39.390 --> 00:16:43.810
to stop the testing of nuclear weapons.

00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:47.760
At that time, the government policy

00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:51.410
was not to make this treaty,
it had not yet been decided,

00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:56.030
but pretty soon it was
decided to make such a treaty.

00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:59.300
I think that I got a good bit of support,

00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:01.920
but some criticism also.

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:04.550
Here I had written this petition together

00:17:04.550 --> 00:17:07.590
with Barry Commoner and Ed Condon.

00:17:07.590 --> 00:17:10.830
Ed Condon is a Berkeley
man who was, at that time,

00:17:10.830 --> 00:17:15.830
professor of physics in
Washington University,

00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:18.570
Barry Commoner, professor of biology

00:17:18.570 --> 00:17:21.560
in Washington University, St. Louis.

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:23.620
We circulated the petition.

00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:28.010
I decided later to, well,
people from foreign countries,

00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:29.953
scientists from foreign countries,

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:34.300
began to send in copies,
signed copies of the petition.

00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:39.080
So my wife and I circulated
it in foreign countries

00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:44.080
and ultimately, turned over
15,000 signatures of scientists

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:48.480
to the Secretary General Dag Hammarskjold

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:51.670
of the United Nations.
- And on another occasion

00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:54.119
when you were in the
Soviet Union you actually

00:17:54.119 --> 00:17:57.330
wrote a letter to
Khrushchev which included

00:17:57.330 --> 00:18:00.250
a draft treaty, which I
gather was very similar

00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:04.140
to the partial test ban which
was eventually adapted in '63?

00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:08.943
- Yes, yes, I didn't get to
talk with Premier Khrushchev

00:18:10.941 --> 00:18:15.941
then, there was an
appointment set up for me,

00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:19.122
and then it was canceled,
and it's hard to know

00:18:19.122 --> 00:18:22.160
why things of this sort are done,

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:26.987
but in fact, in 1961, which
is when this occurred,

00:18:26.987 --> 00:18:30.420
my wife and I asked, we were there

00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:33.230
for a scientific congress,
biochemical congress,

00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:36.520
but we said we would like to speak

00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:38.832
at a peace meeting, a public meeting.

00:18:38.832 --> 00:18:43.832
The Soviet Peace Committee put out posters

00:18:44.493 --> 00:18:48.182
announcing the meeting and we went to it,

00:18:48.182 --> 00:18:51.930
in the Hall, the Hall of
the Scientists in Moscow

00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:54.640
that holds a thousand people.

00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:57.840
We had a film along, the Peace Movement

00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:01.792
in Southern California,
showing a demonstration.

00:19:01.792 --> 00:19:04.280
Two or three thousand
people, perhaps more,

00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:07.555
marching with banners
and meeting in a park

00:19:07.555 --> 00:19:12.555
and my speaking to them,
and then my wife talked

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:15.057
and then I talked, and I said,

00:19:15.057 --> 00:19:17.817
"The Soviet Union has just exploded

00:19:17.817 --> 00:19:22.247
"this 60 megaton bomb, and that, I think,

00:19:22.247 --> 00:19:26.197
"I estimate will cause a
million children to be born

00:19:26.197 --> 00:19:29.659
"over a course of generations,
because these gene mutations

00:19:29.659 --> 00:19:33.067
"last, are passed on, a million children

00:19:33.067 --> 00:19:36.147
"to be born with gross
physical or mental defect

00:19:36.147 --> 00:19:38.667
"that would not have
been defective otherwise,

00:19:38.667 --> 00:19:42.307
"and will cause, perhaps,
just as many people

00:19:42.307 --> 00:19:45.987
"to develop cancer and other disease,

00:19:45.987 --> 00:19:49.137
"and I think it's immoral, unethical

00:19:49.137 --> 00:19:53.480
"for nations to do this
damage to the human race."

00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:55.740
I think that was the last atomic bomb

00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:58.520
that they exploded, but I'm not sure.

00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:02.590
At any rate, the bomb
test treaty negotiations

00:20:02.590 --> 00:20:06.180
were going on and very quickly, next year,

00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:09.067
the treaty was signed
and it went into effect

00:20:09.067 --> 00:20:13.260
in October of 1963.

00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:15.510
- The Nobel Committee, in
awarding you the Peace Prize,

00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:20.510
pointed out that the language
that President Kennedy used

00:20:21.250 --> 00:20:24.700
in his speech announcing the signing

00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:26.779
of the partial test ban was very similar

00:20:26.779 --> 00:20:29.990
to the language that you
had used in defining,

00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:32.230
they did, in fact, the
language you just used

00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:34.440
in describing your speech
in the Soviet Union.

00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:35.493
- Yes, yeah.

00:20:37.630 --> 00:20:42.153
- Was this an instance of
power listening to science?

00:20:42.153 --> 00:20:43.531
- I think so.

00:20:43.531 --> 00:20:48.360
There was a meeting, a
dinner that President Kennedy

00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:52.580
and Mrs. Kennedy held for
recipients of the Nobel Prize

00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:56.340
in the Western Hemisphere
and some of their people.

00:20:56.340 --> 00:21:00.007
And on the day before, my wife and I,

00:21:00.007 --> 00:21:02.060
and on the day of the meeting, in fact,

00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:05.270
had demonstrated outside the White House

00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:06.700
against the bomb tests.

00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:08.780
- [Harry] This would've been in what year?

00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:13.780
- In 1961, I think, possibly 1960.

00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:20.700
We, when we came through
the reception line,

00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:26.477
Mrs. Kennedy, after
shaking hands with me said,

00:21:26.477 --> 00:21:28.857
"Do you think it is right, Dr. Pauling,

00:21:28.857 --> 00:21:31.527
"to march back and forth with your sign

00:21:31.527 --> 00:21:33.150
"outside the White House?"

00:21:33.150 --> 00:21:36.347
So that Caroline says to me, "Mommy,

00:21:36.347 --> 00:21:38.677
"what has Daddy done wrong now?"

00:21:38.677 --> 00:21:39.510
(Harry laughs)

00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:42.190
And then she introduced
me to President Kennedy,

00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:46.177
who said, "Dr. Pauling, I
hope that you will continue

00:21:46.177 --> 00:21:48.970
"to express your opinions."

00:21:48.970 --> 00:21:52.840
And, of course, I think that
it was about at that time

00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:57.710
that he became convinced
that the atmospheric testing

00:21:57.710 --> 00:22:02.260
of bomb, nuclear weapons, was
really the wrong thing to do

00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:05.100
and began applying political pressure

00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:10.100
to the Senate to approve
the test ban treaty,

00:22:10.744 --> 00:22:15.744
well, began deciding to
instruct his negotiators to sign

00:22:18.610 --> 00:22:20.960
the test ban treaty.
- Do you think

00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:24.470
if he had lived that the
progress on arms control

00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:26.510
would have been more significant,

00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:28.390
since he had gone through this process

00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:30.330
of negotiating this treaty,
and then, of course,

00:22:30.330 --> 00:22:32.862
he had gone through the
Cuban Missile Crisis.

00:22:32.862 --> 00:22:34.110
- The Cuban Missile, yes, well,

00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:39.110
he, I think he had a real
understanding of the significance

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:43.253
of nuclear weapons and
a very great concern

00:22:43.253 --> 00:22:47.130
for his responsibility, and of course,

00:22:47.130 --> 00:22:52.130
I believe that he admired
Khrushchev for his restraint.

00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:56.470
They handled that missile crisis well.

00:22:56.470 --> 00:23:00.220
I think he could understand
that if the United States

00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:04.417
had weapons, the feeling by Khrushchev

00:23:04.417 --> 00:23:07.930
and the other Soviet leaders,
that if the United States

00:23:07.930 --> 00:23:11.690
had rockets armed with nuclear warheads

00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:14.950
in Turkey and other places
close to the Soviet Union,

00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:17.970
why shouldn't the Soviet
Union put them in Cuba?

00:23:17.970 --> 00:23:20.290
But, of course, it was
the wrong thing to do.

00:23:20.290 --> 00:23:23.610
It's good that there was some restraint

00:23:23.610 --> 00:23:26.750
over the spread of nuclear weapons.

00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:31.409
- Why has it been so
difficult to bridge this gap

00:23:31.409 --> 00:23:34.327
between the insights of scientists

00:23:34.327 --> 00:23:39.327
and the thinking and actions
of our political leaders?

00:23:41.010 --> 00:23:42.980
Because if you go through this history

00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:44.839
of the peace movement in the 50s,

00:23:44.839 --> 00:23:48.280
it's as if we're reliving
all of this again today.

00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:49.640
- That's right, it looks as though

00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:52.790
we haven't learned anything
from recent history

00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:57.790
of 25 years ago when the hydrogen bomb,

00:23:57.830 --> 00:24:00.600
the three stage bomb had been developed.

00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:05.014
The weapons became, the
individual bombs, warheads,

00:24:05.014 --> 00:24:07.020
became a thousand times more powerful

00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:09.580
than the Hiroshima-Nagasaki bombs.

00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:12.300
10 or 20,000 times more powerful

00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:16.700
than the one ton
blockbusters with which most

00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:20.420
of the bombings were done
in the Second World War.

00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:24.570
The stockpiles had already
become irrationally great

00:24:24.570 --> 00:24:28.700
25 years ago, the analysts all talked

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:32.970
about a 10,000 megaton
attack on the United States

00:24:32.970 --> 00:24:37.490
and a 10,000 megaton
counterattack on the Soviet Union

00:24:37.490 --> 00:24:42.490
and were making estimates
about, perhaps 80% of the people

00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:47.863
would be dead 60 days after the attack.

00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:53.150
So that the situation now
is we still talk about

00:24:53.150 --> 00:24:56.420
10,000 megaton attacks, it
hasn't changed very much

00:24:56.420 --> 00:25:01.420
in that respect, the need
for detente was clear,

00:25:02.970 --> 00:25:07.470
and of course, we went through
a period of a number of years

00:25:07.470 --> 00:25:11.660
when the relationship was better,

00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:16.610
but there was still, there
were still changes being made

00:25:16.610 --> 00:25:20.340
in the development of nuclear weapons.

00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:24.940
Usually, with the United
States taking the lead,

00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:28.620
just as we had a five year lead initially

00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:31.350
on building atomic bombs.

00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:35.290
We introduced the idea of, well,

00:25:35.290 --> 00:25:39.430
the anti-ballistic
missile, this development

00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:41.920
along these lines was stopped by a treaty.

00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:44.840
That was one case where
a good treaty was made

00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:48.090
between the United States
and the Soviet Union.

00:25:48.090 --> 00:25:52.130
The idea of MIRV, multiple independently

00:25:52.130 --> 00:25:57.130
directable re-entry vehicles
with nuclear warheads

00:25:58.850 --> 00:26:01.412
so that a single big
rocket, instead of carrying

00:26:01.412 --> 00:26:06.412
a 20 megaton bomb that
would essentially destroy

00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:12.260
Moscow or any other city,
could be made more effective

00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:18.520
because there aren't
many 20 megaton targets.

00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:23.490
Instead, it could carry,
perhaps 16 small rockets,

00:26:23.490 --> 00:26:27.000
each with its own one megaton bomb,

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:31.570
20 or 25 times as big as a
Hiroshima or Nagasaki bomb,

00:26:31.570 --> 00:26:36.570
big enough for most
cities, and with computers

00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:41.640
and programmed in such a way
that 16 different targets

00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:45.390
could be destroyed, and a few years later,

00:26:45.390 --> 00:26:49.040
the Soviet Union also, they
haven't quite caught up

00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:51.820
with us on MIRVing their big rockets,

00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:54.580
but they're well on their way.

00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:57.670
So, now we have the cruise missile,

00:26:57.670 --> 00:27:00.900
and I heard Andropov speak.

00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:05.900
I was in Moscow the 21st of
December, three weeks ago,

00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:11.160
when a month, nearly a month ago

00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:15.427
when Andropov gave his
talk in which he said

00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:19.800
that they were willing to cut
down on intermediate range

00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:22.681
missiles to the number that the West had,

00:27:22.681 --> 00:27:25.037
Britain, France, the United States,

00:27:25.037 --> 00:27:27.270
and would continue to cut down

00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:29.470
if we were willing to cut down.

00:27:29.470 --> 00:27:32.350
But he went on to become very tough then,

00:27:32.350 --> 00:27:36.877
I suppose he has to,
under the circumstances,

00:27:36.877 --> 00:27:41.140
with a tough opponent
in the United States,

00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:44.061
and he said that they
were well on their way

00:27:44.061 --> 00:27:46.020
toward completing the development

00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:49.400
of their own cruise
missile, if we went ahead

00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:52.200
with our 7,000 cruise missiles.

00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:53.890
Very dangerous business,

00:27:53.890 --> 00:27:57.156
they would soon have an equal number.

00:27:57.156 --> 00:27:59.686
- So the race has gone on.
- And they're going to--

00:27:59.686 --> 00:28:01.410
- And it--
- Yes, he said

00:28:02.496 --> 00:28:04.180
they would keep up with us, of course,

00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:06.542
Reagan, President Reagan
says we'll keep ahead

00:28:06.542 --> 00:28:08.893
of the Soviet Union.

00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:13.730
What is going to happen
if these two great nations

00:28:13.730 --> 00:28:18.670
are not able to get enough
sense to stop this waste

00:28:18.670 --> 00:28:23.330
of money and this increasing of the danger

00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:26.090
of a nuclear war breaking out?

00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:29.460
As these weapons become
and the delivery vehicles,

00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:33.483
the whole system, become
more and more complicated,

00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:37.570
the chance that there
will be a technological

00:28:37.570 --> 00:28:40.530
or psychological accident that initiates

00:28:40.530 --> 00:28:45.530
the catastrophic interchange
of these terribly destructive

00:28:45.933 --> 00:28:49.240
weapons becomes greater and greater,

00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:52.160
so that we get in more and more danger

00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:54.690
that a nuclear war will break out.

00:28:54.690 --> 00:28:57.690
When the world is destroyed,
it'll be by accident,

00:28:57.690 --> 00:29:02.310
not by design, not by this direct decision

00:29:02.310 --> 00:29:06.160
of Reagan or Andropov, but by accident.

00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:08.829
- Why then have the politicians,

00:29:08.829 --> 00:29:11.050
the political leaders on both sides

00:29:11.050 --> 00:29:16.050
failed to heed the warnings
about these dangers?

00:29:16.233 --> 00:29:18.670
When one goes through this history

00:29:18.670 --> 00:29:21.270
or reads your very good book, No More War,

00:29:21.270 --> 00:29:24.270
published in 1958, you
find that the issues

00:29:24.270 --> 00:29:28.388
have been on the table since
early times in this new era.

00:29:28.388 --> 00:29:30.989
- The arguments in my book
are essentially the same.

00:29:30.989 --> 00:29:35.989
I talked about a 20,000 megaton bomb war,

00:29:37.130 --> 00:29:40.770
20,000 megaton war, 10,000
from each side there,

00:29:40.770 --> 00:29:43.047
and that's what we still talk about,

00:29:43.047 --> 00:29:48.047
and the other dangers and
the need for making the world

00:29:48.210 --> 00:29:52.290
a safer place, the arguments
are still just as good

00:29:52.290 --> 00:29:56.610
25 years after this book was published.

00:29:56.610 --> 00:29:59.600
And why haven't we got control?

00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:03.527
Well, the Soviet Union, first, the people

00:30:03.527 --> 00:30:08.527
and the government fear war,
they don't want to have a war.

00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:13.860
They are afraid, also, of
attack by the Western powers.

00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:18.710
They are afraid of the
anti-communism that we know exists,

00:30:18.710 --> 00:30:21.060
upon the express statement that we

00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:23.920
are out to destroy communism.

00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:26.890
And they are more afraid than we are,

00:30:26.890 --> 00:30:28.820
because they know what war is.

00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:32.580
There were 50 times as many
people in the Soviet Union

00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:36.850
killed in the Second
World War as Americans

00:30:36.850 --> 00:30:38.780
killed in the Second World War.

00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:42.963
They experienced the destruction
of their own country.

00:30:42.963 --> 00:30:47.630
So, I think that they
feel that they have to try

00:30:47.630 --> 00:30:50.520
to keep up with the United States

00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:53.963
and not tempt our militarists.

00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:59.717
Now, our position has
been made pretty clear,

00:30:59.717 --> 00:31:04.717
year after year, or decade
after decade from 30 years ago,

00:31:05.596 --> 00:31:09.420
that our gross national product

00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:11.990
is twice that of the Soviet Union.

00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:16.990
We fear communism, that communism
will take over the world.

00:31:17.132 --> 00:31:22.132
Well, as Khrushchev said,
"They say communism is so good

00:31:22.627 --> 00:31:25.650
"a system that it's
inevitable that it take over."

00:31:25.650 --> 00:31:30.650
And we don't agree with
that, so we fear communism

00:31:30.750 --> 00:31:35.750
and think that we must
prevent the takeover.

00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:41.060
Our, we are twice as
affluent as the Soviet Union,

00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:44.790
have twice the gross national
product of the Soviet Union.

00:31:44.790 --> 00:31:48.110
The burden of militarism,
even if it were great for us

00:31:48.110 --> 00:31:51.040
would be twice as great for them.

00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:54.070
President Reagan issued, a few months ago,

00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:58.690
a national security directive that repeats

00:31:58.690 --> 00:32:03.690
the statement that we must
apply economic pressure,

00:32:04.990 --> 00:32:07.930
military pressure, diplomatic pressure,

00:32:07.930 --> 00:32:11.380
propagandistic pressure
on the Soviet Union

00:32:11.380 --> 00:32:14.630
with the hope of eliminating
it from the world.

00:32:14.630 --> 00:32:19.630
In fact, he said to the,
in June, I think it was,

00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:22.460
he spoke to the British
Parliament in London

00:32:22.460 --> 00:32:25.372
and said that by applying this pressure,

00:32:25.372 --> 00:32:28.670
we, ultimately shall achieve

00:32:28.670 --> 00:32:33.060
the goal of leaving Marxism, Leninism

00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:34.980
on the ash heap of history.

00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:36.943
I'm quoting President Reagan.

00:32:37.990 --> 00:32:42.990
So we have a goal, that
of applying pressure

00:32:43.510 --> 00:32:46.860
by increasing military expenditures

00:32:46.860 --> 00:32:51.770
until finally they become
intolerable for the Soviet Union.

00:32:51.770 --> 00:32:55.270
I read one statement by a commentator

00:32:55.270 --> 00:32:57.445
back in Connecticut who said,

00:32:57.445 --> 00:33:02.260
"President Reagan's plan, that by spending

00:33:04.367 --> 00:33:07.657
"our spending 1.6 trillion dollars

00:33:07.657 --> 00:33:12.327
"on militarism in the next five years,

00:33:12.327 --> 00:33:17.327
"to bankrupt the Soviet Union,
already in its first year

00:33:18.707 --> 00:33:21.617
"has come close, has
brought the United States

00:33:21.617 --> 00:33:25.627
"to the verge of bankruptcy,
not only economically,

00:33:25.627 --> 00:33:29.457
"but also morally and spiritually."

00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:33.050
- So that what the
politicians didn't learn

00:33:33.050 --> 00:33:36.450
from the scientists was
to go beyond this notion

00:33:36.450 --> 00:33:38.120
that victory is still possible,

00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:39.600
is that what you're suggesting?

00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:43.588
I mean, that they believe
that by building up

00:33:43.588 --> 00:33:48.180
nuclear weapons they can,
not necessarily have to go

00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:51.930
to nuclear war, but will be in a position

00:33:51.930 --> 00:33:53.910
to keep the other party down, and then,

00:33:53.910 --> 00:33:56.450
by simultaneously
applying economic screws,

00:33:56.450 --> 00:33:58.280
possibly even break the system,

00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:00.991
so that the politicians
haven't really gotten over

00:34:00.991 --> 00:34:05.565
these old ways of thinking that Einstein

00:34:05.565 --> 00:34:09.300
and others warned, they really
would have to move beyond.

00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:11.933
- That's right, they haven't recognized

00:34:11.933 --> 00:34:16.680
that this is just too
dangerous a policy to follow,

00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:19.510
And I am sure that President Reagan

00:34:19.510 --> 00:34:22.460
and his advisors do not anticipate

00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:24.970
that there will be a nuclear war.

00:34:24.970 --> 00:34:27.610
I'm sure that they don't
believe the statement

00:34:27.610 --> 00:34:31.820
that they made last year,
that we might carry on

00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:34.640
a militant nuclear war in Europe

00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:37.690
and still not destroy the world.

00:34:37.690 --> 00:34:39.160
I'm sure they don't believe that.

00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:42.483
That was just propaganda
to get the American people

00:34:42.483 --> 00:34:47.483
to accept the whole idea of
continuing the military buildup

00:34:48.370 --> 00:34:51.950
and the increase in the
military budget at the same time

00:34:51.950 --> 00:34:56.950
that we are having trouble
with the parts of the budget

00:34:56.960 --> 00:35:01.343
that relate to the wellbeing
of the American people.

00:35:03.490 --> 00:35:05.603
This is just propaganda, they don't think

00:35:05.603 --> 00:35:08.280
that we can have, I have said that well,

00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:11.050
perhaps limited war in
Europe would be all right,

00:35:11.050 --> 00:35:15.950
it wouldn't get any objection
because the Soviet Union

00:35:15.950 --> 00:35:18.530
wouldn't be harmed,
they wouldn't complain,

00:35:18.530 --> 00:35:21.070
we wouldn't be harmed,
we wouldn't complain,

00:35:21.070 --> 00:35:24.680
the European nations wouldn't complain

00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:27.280
because they wouldn't exist any longer.

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:30.241
Well, of course, the fact
is that even a limited war

00:35:30.241 --> 00:35:34.570
with the radioactive fallout,
to the dust thrown up

00:35:34.570 --> 00:35:38.890
in the air that might prevent
the sun shining through

00:35:38.890 --> 00:35:42.040
for a long time, smoke
from the forest fires

00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:47.040
that might hinder the growth of plant life

00:35:48.450 --> 00:35:51.121
on the surface of the
earth, all over the earth

00:35:51.121 --> 00:35:56.121
for months or years, and
the radioactive fallout

00:35:56.850 --> 00:35:59.760
spread all over the world, the carbon-14

00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:04.760
that has a half life of 5,070 years,

00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:07.750
and continues to damage human beings

00:36:07.750 --> 00:36:09.850
would continue if they existed

00:36:09.850 --> 00:36:13.389
for tens of thousands of years.

00:36:13.389 --> 00:36:18.389
These events, even in
a limited nuclear war

00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:24.360
involving, say, only a thousand
times or a hundred times

00:36:24.610 --> 00:36:29.610
the explosive power of
the Second World War,

00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:33.896
might well mean the end of the human race.

00:36:33.896 --> 00:36:38.482
So, we need to have a change in thinking

00:36:38.482 --> 00:36:41.043
that Einstein talked about.

00:36:42.100 --> 00:36:45.980
- And why, I still want to understand

00:36:45.980 --> 00:36:47.640
why this hasn't come about.

00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:50.870
In other words, did
these efforts of the 50s

00:36:50.870 --> 00:36:55.530
and early 60s fail to win
the bulk of public opinion

00:36:55.530 --> 00:36:58.940
in this country, I mean,
did the issue sort of recede

00:36:58.940 --> 00:37:02.590
into the background and
more immediate issues

00:37:02.590 --> 00:37:05.412
like the Vietnam War,
for example, and so on,

00:37:05.412 --> 00:37:06.890
because when you go through this material,

00:37:06.890 --> 00:37:09.190
from the period when you
were so actively involved,

00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:12.960
so much of it resonates
with what we're hearing now

00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:15.450
and in some ways, it's bothersome

00:37:15.450 --> 00:37:17.650
that it's as if we haven't
learned the lessons

00:37:17.650 --> 00:37:18.717
that were very clear
from the very beginning.

00:37:18.717 --> 00:37:21.720
- You know, statements,
we were making statements

00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:24.910
of this sort, especially,
when the stockpiles

00:37:24.910 --> 00:37:27.840
of nuclear weapons got up to 600 megatons,

00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:31.170
a hundred times, this was very early,

00:37:31.170 --> 00:37:33.790
a hundred times the Second World War,

00:37:33.790 --> 00:37:37.840
and it seemed that it
already was irrational

00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:40.000
to have such destructive power.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:44.270
Then they got to 6,000,
perhaps even to 60,000.

00:37:44.270 --> 00:37:47.688
Estimates now are usually around 30,000

00:37:47.688 --> 00:37:52.688
as the total stockpiles,
but that order of magnitude.

00:37:53.930 --> 00:37:58.090
It was really, as Philip
Morrison said, insane

00:37:58.090 --> 00:38:02.230
for the human race to have developed

00:38:02.230 --> 00:38:07.230
the powers of self destruction
to this level, and why?

00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:11.221
Well, back 25 years ago, 20 years ago,

00:38:11.221 --> 00:38:14.230
the bomb test treaty went into effect.

00:38:14.230 --> 00:38:16.520
This was in the period, looked as though

00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:19.850
there was some sanity
coming into the situation.

00:38:19.850 --> 00:38:22.540
There was a period of detente

00:38:22.540 --> 00:38:26.210
and then, of course, the decision was made

00:38:26.210 --> 00:38:30.970
to contain communism by participating

00:38:30.970 --> 00:38:34.610
in the war in Korea, and then in Vietnam.

00:38:34.610 --> 00:38:39.610
Not very successful efforts
to contain communism,

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.434
and the wrong kind, I think.

00:38:42.434 --> 00:38:47.000
How much money we waste on
militarism in the world,

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:51.990
something like 600 billion dollars a year,

00:38:51.990 --> 00:38:55.950
equal to the total
income of more than half

00:38:55.950 --> 00:38:59.000
of the people in the world.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:02.855
A terrible waste, think
of what good could be done

00:39:02.855 --> 00:39:06.940
if we were not to expend so much money.

00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:09.920
There are great problems
to be solved in the world,

00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:13.170
to be attacked, the
problem of overpopulation,

00:39:13.170 --> 00:39:15.610
the problem just of feeding people

00:39:15.610 --> 00:39:18.074
is going to be more and more serious

00:39:18.074 --> 00:39:20.793
when encroachment on the environment,

00:39:22.270 --> 00:39:26.160
possible catastrophe from
damage to the ozone layer

00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:31.160
and so on, and we aren't
cooperating in solving them.

00:39:31.180 --> 00:39:33.820
The United States and the Soviet Union,

00:39:33.820 --> 00:39:36.020
even if they were to be cooperating

00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:40.360
in solving these problems,
would have and will have

00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:43.360
in the future, a pretty difficult time,

00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:45.540
and when they are fighting each other

00:39:45.540 --> 00:39:48.180
in the ways that they are, wasting money

00:39:48.180 --> 00:39:51.290
on militarism, senseless militarism,

00:39:51.290 --> 00:39:55.270
there's not much chance of
solving these other problems.

00:39:55.270 --> 00:39:58.587
I'm asked from time to time, am I hopeful?

00:39:58.587 --> 00:40:02.230
And I say, I am, I
believe that we are going

00:40:02.230 --> 00:40:06.130
to get through this difficult
period that we are in,

00:40:06.130 --> 00:40:10.250
that rationality will
come into the conduct

00:40:10.250 --> 00:40:13.970
of world affairs and I have evidence.

00:40:13.970 --> 00:40:18.120
If I weren't hopeful, why
should I be spending my time

00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:21.700
going around, making television interviews

00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:26.362
and giving talks, popular
talks and traveling around,

00:40:26.362 --> 00:40:30.890
working for world peace, if
I didn't think we'd succeed,

00:40:30.890 --> 00:40:33.180
I might as well be enjoying myself,

00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:36.170
reading the physical
and chemical literature

00:40:36.170 --> 00:40:40.080
and trying to solve some
of the interesting problems

00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:44.420
about nuclear structure
and molecular structure

00:40:44.420 --> 00:40:49.420
and even about the vitamins
and their interaction

00:40:49.710 --> 00:40:54.270
with the human body and
trying to find some way

00:40:54.270 --> 00:40:58.850
of decreasing the amount of
suffering caused by disease.

00:40:58.850 --> 00:41:02.100
So I believe that we are
going to be successful.

00:41:02.100 --> 00:41:05.130
The fact that I believed 25 years ago

00:41:05.130 --> 00:41:08.060
that we were going to be
successful rather soon

00:41:08.060 --> 00:41:10.320
doesn't keep me from believing now

00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:12.240
that we are going to be successful.

00:41:12.240 --> 00:41:15.380
And the fact that there hasn't been a war

00:41:16.368 --> 00:41:18.640
between the United States
and the Soviet Union

00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:22.320
in the 25 years, leads me to believe

00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:25.230
that the nuclear deterrent
really does work,

00:41:25.230 --> 00:41:30.050
it does work, it's insanely
high, overdeveloped,

00:41:32.580 --> 00:41:37.580
but it works, and the danger
is that it will cease to work

00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:43.250
because of some accident, and
that this would be the result

00:41:43.250 --> 00:41:47.410
of our poor sense in
continuing to make the system

00:41:47.410 --> 00:41:50.800
more and more complicated
instead of trying to simplify it

00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:53.370
and getting it under control.

00:41:53.370 --> 00:41:58.370
- In your book, No More
War, you discuss how science

00:41:59.710 --> 00:42:02.398
had become the handmaiden of war.

00:42:02.398 --> 00:42:06.880
Really helped to think about war,

00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:09.730
to define new instruments of warfare,

00:42:09.730 --> 00:42:12.010
and to define new strategies,

00:42:12.010 --> 00:42:15.382
and you propose, in that book,

00:42:15.382 --> 00:42:20.270
that science more and more
become a handmaiden of peace,

00:42:20.270 --> 00:42:25.260
really, that an international
research organization

00:42:25.260 --> 00:42:28.620
for peace studies, that would deal

00:42:28.620 --> 00:42:30.770
with many of the problems
you just discussed,

00:42:30.770 --> 00:42:33.330
should be instituted and so on.

00:42:33.330 --> 00:42:36.728
I wonder if you might reflect on that now.

00:42:36.728 --> 00:42:37.890
As you probably know, the
University of California

00:42:37.890 --> 00:42:39.900
is going through a process now,

00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:42.600
of evaluating what it should be doing

00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:44.950
in the realm of peace studies and so on,

00:42:44.950 --> 00:42:47.474
and I wondered if you
would share your thoughts

00:42:47.474 --> 00:42:48.503
with us on that issue.

00:42:48.503 --> 00:42:52.642
- Well, there are a number of
rather small peace research

00:42:52.642 --> 00:42:56.118
institutes and institutions
that have been set up.

00:42:56.118 --> 00:43:01.118
Some contribute very little,
like the Hoover Institution

00:43:03.170 --> 00:43:04.910
on War and Peace at Stanford

00:43:04.910 --> 00:43:07.330
that doesn't pay much attention

00:43:07.330 --> 00:43:10.328
to world peace, it seems to me,

00:43:10.328 --> 00:43:15.328
or the United States
government's disarmament

00:43:15.751 --> 00:43:19.366
and, I've forgotten the rest of it.

00:43:19.366 --> 00:43:20.760
- The Arms Control Disarmament Agency.

00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:22.910
- [Both] Arms Control
and Disarmament Agency.

00:43:22.910 --> 00:43:24.995
- It seems to me to contribute little

00:43:24.995 --> 00:43:27.910
directly to world peace.

00:43:27.910 --> 00:43:31.450
My idea on it, this could
be a government function,

00:43:31.450 --> 00:43:34.083
may not be a very reasonable one.

00:43:35.115 --> 00:43:35.948
It may be better to get it as far

00:43:35.948 --> 00:43:39.103
as possible away from governments.

00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:44.850
I envisage the large
place where there would be

00:43:44.850 --> 00:43:47.920
essentially, like a great university,

00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:52.630
a very great university,
where the staff members

00:43:52.630 --> 00:43:54.920
would be interested in world peace,

00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:58.470
and would devote part of
their time to striving

00:43:58.470 --> 00:44:01.900
to solve the problem of
eliminating war from the world

00:44:01.900 --> 00:44:04.850
and planning out a better world

00:44:04.850 --> 00:44:09.563
and that they would also
be productive scholars,

00:44:10.940 --> 00:44:13.987
working on problems,
perhaps basic problems

00:44:13.987 --> 00:44:18.480
in fields of science, or
problems of applied science

00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:23.480
that would help in the
question of overpopulation

00:44:23.790 --> 00:44:26.700
or damage to the environment
and all the others.

00:44:26.700 --> 00:44:31.660
Some of them, sort of, futurists
trying to plan the future.

00:44:31.660 --> 00:44:36.250
I think it would be fine if
the University of California,

00:44:36.250 --> 00:44:39.950
I think Harvard has a rather small group

00:44:39.950 --> 00:44:42.340
that might be described in this way,

00:44:42.340 --> 00:44:44.930
that would be fine if there were a large

00:44:44.930 --> 00:44:48.340
and effective group in the
University of California.

00:44:48.340 --> 00:44:51.260
Here we have a university that I have,

00:44:51.260 --> 00:44:55.310
from time to time, ever since 1945, '48,

00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:59.870
when I was Eastman Professor at Oxford,

00:44:59.870 --> 00:45:03.023
described as the greatest
university in the world,

00:45:04.152 --> 00:45:06.270
and I still think of it in this sense.

00:45:06.270 --> 00:45:09.300
The University of
California needs to continue

00:45:09.300 --> 00:45:11.930
to lead the world, and what we need

00:45:11.930 --> 00:45:15.980
more than anything else is to
lead the world toward peace.

00:45:15.980 --> 00:45:19.820
- Do you feel that science
in this postwar period

00:45:19.820 --> 00:45:24.330
has been corrupted by its
relationship to the government

00:45:24.330 --> 00:45:26.671
and its relation to weapons programs?

00:45:26.671 --> 00:45:29.480
- No, I don't think so.

00:45:29.480 --> 00:45:33.017
There's misuse of science, in my opinion,

00:45:33.017 --> 00:45:38.017
all this weaponry stuff
is a misuse of science.

00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:40.920
Individual scientists have been tempted

00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:44.710
into working for the
government, working on weapons,

00:45:44.710 --> 00:45:46.700
either directly or indirectly.

00:45:46.700 --> 00:45:50.250
I've seen the statement that
half of American scientists

00:45:50.250 --> 00:45:52.340
are involved in one way or another.

00:45:52.340 --> 00:45:53.173
- [Harry] Yes, I saw
that the other day, yeah.

00:45:53.173 --> 00:45:56.067
- Yes, well, it would be
better if most of them

00:45:56.067 --> 00:46:00.500
were working for the
welfare of human beings

00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:03.140
in one way or another,
and there's plenty of work

00:46:03.140 --> 00:46:07.300
to be done, we haven't
exhausted the problems,

00:46:07.300 --> 00:46:09.370
the scientific problems.

00:46:09.370 --> 00:46:13.720
Individual scientists, I
have said that I don't think

00:46:13.720 --> 00:46:16.110
that the scientists could get together,

00:46:16.110 --> 00:46:20.747
all of them, and decide that
they would not work on weapons,

00:46:20.747 --> 00:46:24.800
that they would not
work for the government.

00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:27.210
This would mean that we were instituting

00:46:27.210 --> 00:46:29.860
an oligarchy of scientists.

00:46:29.860 --> 00:46:32.660
I think that the country, the world,

00:46:32.660 --> 00:46:35.080
should be run by the people as a whole,

00:46:35.080 --> 00:46:38.973
not by any small group, not
by an oligarchy of scientists.

00:46:41.776 --> 00:46:44.890
- What about the problem of
science in the Soviet Union

00:46:44.890 --> 00:46:47.170
and the problem of science
and peace movements

00:46:47.170 --> 00:46:48.729
in the Soviet Union.

00:46:48.729 --> 00:46:51.760
I wonder if you would share
your thoughts with us.

00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:55.080
One can compare, for example, your career

00:46:55.080 --> 00:46:58.300
and your harassment by the government here

00:46:58.300 --> 00:47:01.380
with the situation of a
Sakharov, for example,

00:47:01.380 --> 00:47:04.270
or with the suppression, recently,

00:47:04.270 --> 00:47:06.410
of a burgeoning peace movement there.

00:47:06.410 --> 00:47:09.320
I wonder if you would share
with us your views on that?

00:47:10.302 --> 00:47:12.950
- Well, I was harassed, of
course, in a less blatant way

00:47:12.950 --> 00:47:16.470
when my passport was refused at the time

00:47:16.470 --> 00:47:18.930
that the Royal Society of London

00:47:18.930 --> 00:47:21.700
had arranged a conference of scientists,

00:47:21.700 --> 00:47:24.910
a two day symposium on the alpha helix

00:47:24.910 --> 00:47:29.483
and the pleated sheets, on
my idea, so I was to speak.

00:47:29.483 --> 00:47:31.453
- [Harry] Very directly
related to national security

00:47:31.453 --> 00:47:34.750
- I was the first speaker,
and the second speaker

00:47:34.750 --> 00:47:37.060
was my associate, Professor Corey,

00:47:37.060 --> 00:47:39.440
and then there were talks from people

00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:42.100
from many countries
over the next two days.

00:47:42.100 --> 00:47:47.100
I wasn't there, because my
passport was withheld from me

00:47:48.300 --> 00:47:52.060
on the grounds, so far,
the statement was made

00:47:52.060 --> 00:47:55.070
that not in the best interests
of the United States,

00:47:55.070 --> 00:48:00.070
also a statement that my
anti-communist statements

00:48:02.090 --> 00:48:07.090
hadn't been strong enough,
so I didn't get to go,

00:48:07.340 --> 00:48:12.340
to see the X-ray photographs
taken by Rosalind Franklin,

00:48:15.519 --> 00:48:18.580
which I would have seen
if I had gone to London

00:48:18.580 --> 00:48:22.530
on that occasion, and
others I was prevented

00:48:22.530 --> 00:48:26.487
from attending, various
scientific congresses,

00:48:26.487 --> 00:48:30.610
and, of course, I was threatened
by the internal security

00:48:30.610 --> 00:48:33.210
subcommittee of the
Senate with a year in jail

00:48:33.210 --> 00:48:38.120
for contempt of Senate,
when I was being harassed

00:48:38.120 --> 00:48:41.088
by the internal security subcommittee.

00:48:41.088 --> 00:48:46.088
Well, things aren't so bad,
I wasn't treated so badly

00:48:46.170 --> 00:48:48.400
as Russian scientists are treated.

00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:50.400
I think of Russia, the first time I went

00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:53.983
to the United States in 1957, I thought,

00:48:53.983 --> 00:48:58.490
that this is something
like Oregon in 1907,

00:48:58.490 --> 00:49:03.490
my early memories as a
boy and youth in Oregon,

00:49:03.510 --> 00:49:07.180
the simplicity of the people,
the simplicity of the life.

00:49:07.180 --> 00:49:11.605
And I think the Soviet
Union just lags behind us

00:49:11.605 --> 00:49:16.390
in the way that it treats
individual human beings, too.

00:49:16.390 --> 00:49:20.130
We aren't trying to help them to catch up,

00:49:20.130 --> 00:49:23.020
we try to hinder them in whatever way

00:49:23.020 --> 00:49:27.290
we can to catch up with us.

00:49:27.290 --> 00:49:31.780
When I was invited by the
Supreme Soviet last month

00:49:31.780 --> 00:49:34.770
to come to the Soviet
Union to help celebrate

00:49:34.770 --> 00:49:38.620
the 60th anniversary of the
founding of the Soviet Union,

00:49:38.620 --> 00:49:42.530
and I'm sure I was invited
because I had been given

00:49:42.530 --> 00:49:46.450
the international Lenin
Peace Prize 10 years after

00:49:46.450 --> 00:49:48.800
I got the Nobel Peace Prize.

00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:53.800
When I was invited to come, I got there,

00:49:55.100 --> 00:49:58.830
and I gave them a list of the
people that I wanted to see,

00:49:58.830 --> 00:50:02.190
including Sakharov, that
I wanted to talk with.

00:50:02.190 --> 00:50:04.330
I didn't get to see Sakharov.

00:50:04.330 --> 00:50:09.330
I may have if, I had
said I would say 10 days.

00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:12.180
After six days, I got sort of bored.

00:50:12.180 --> 00:50:14.810
It was the 23rd of December and I thought

00:50:14.810 --> 00:50:19.690
of two of my children and their spouses

00:50:19.690 --> 00:50:23.227
in California, and
grandchildren in California,

00:50:23.227 --> 00:50:25.510
and I started wanting to get back.

00:50:25.510 --> 00:50:28.873
I came home four days
early, and gave up on,

00:50:28.873 --> 00:50:33.873
I didn't see, didn't go ahead
with the last of my program.

00:50:34.401 --> 00:50:39.401
So there's room for a lot of improvement

00:50:40.450 --> 00:50:43.690
in the Soviet Union just as there is room

00:50:43.690 --> 00:50:46.288
for a lot of improvement
in the United States

00:50:46.288 --> 00:50:49.335
in the human rights issue.

00:50:49.335 --> 00:50:53.480
An important issue in human
rights, it seems to me,

00:50:53.480 --> 00:50:57.550
is the basic human right of having a job,

00:50:57.550 --> 00:51:00.564
contributing to the work of the world,

00:51:00.564 --> 00:51:05.564
feeling pride that you
are part of the human race

00:51:07.160 --> 00:51:10.960
and are doing your part
in keeping the human race

00:51:10.960 --> 00:51:13.420
going, doing work that needs to be done.

00:51:13.420 --> 00:51:17.119
And yet, here our system
depends on having millions,

00:51:17.119 --> 00:51:22.119
over 10 million now,
American people, out of work.

00:51:22.840 --> 00:51:26.070
This is a great violation of human rights,

00:51:26.070 --> 00:51:28.283
the rights of the individual human beings,

00:51:29.250 --> 00:51:31.610
so there's something
wrong with our system,

00:51:31.610 --> 00:51:35.250
well, there's a lot wrong
with the Soviet system.

00:51:35.250 --> 00:51:39.050
In my book, No More War, in 1925, I said

00:51:39.050 --> 00:51:44.050
that I foresee that with
cooperation between our nations,

00:51:45.290 --> 00:51:47.740
working to solve the
problems of the world,

00:51:47.740 --> 00:51:50.410
these systems will change, develop,

00:51:50.410 --> 00:51:54.340
incorporating into each the
better features of the other,

00:51:54.340 --> 00:51:59.340
until finally, I hope, we'll have a world

00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:05.610
in which each human being
is able to lead a good life.

00:52:05.610 --> 00:52:07.560
There aren't many people in the world

00:52:07.560 --> 00:52:10.380
who lead really good lives now.

00:52:10.380 --> 00:52:12.920
- One final question, if you look back

00:52:12.920 --> 00:52:17.920
at your involvement in the peace movement

00:52:18.890 --> 00:52:21.030
and your experiences in politics,

00:52:21.030 --> 00:52:23.360
are there any lessons that you learned

00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:26.420
about things that you
would've done differently,

00:52:26.420 --> 00:52:28.840
or things that you think you did right,

00:52:28.840 --> 00:52:32.020
that you think show an example for people

00:52:32.020 --> 00:52:33.670
presently involved in the movement?

00:52:33.670 --> 00:52:38.020
- Well, one problem that
my wife and I experienced

00:52:38.020 --> 00:52:41.140
in the peace movement, 25 years ago,

00:52:41.140 --> 00:52:43.718
in that period, or 30 years ago,

00:52:43.718 --> 00:52:48.718
is that of difficulty in cooperation.

00:52:49.530 --> 00:52:54.530
We were not active members
of peace organizations

00:52:56.710 --> 00:53:00.860
to any very great extent, she
and I worked by ourselves.

00:53:00.860 --> 00:53:05.420
We arranged, in 1961, an
international conference

00:53:05.420 --> 00:53:10.110
of 60 scientists from 15 countries in Oslo

00:53:10.110 --> 00:53:14.470
to discuss the issue of
spread of nuclear weapons.

00:53:14.470 --> 00:53:16.740
It was a conference against the spread

00:53:16.740 --> 00:53:20.560
of nuclear weapons, we
got out a good report,

00:53:20.560 --> 00:53:23.280
giving the reasons for this.

00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:26.140
And I was pleased that President Kennedy,

00:53:26.140 --> 00:53:29.750
again, seemed to me to have
cribbed from this report

00:53:29.750 --> 00:53:32.250
when he gave his speech against

00:53:32.250 --> 00:53:34.530
the spread of nuclear weapons.

00:53:34.530 --> 00:53:37.380
We included in this
statement, which was signed

00:53:37.380 --> 00:53:41.198
by all 60 scientists, a
statement that loyalty

00:53:41.198 --> 00:53:44.990
to ones' own nation is not enough.

00:53:44.990 --> 00:53:49.820
We now need to be loyal to
the human race as a whole.

00:53:49.820 --> 00:53:53.260
I was afraid, when this
statement was written,

00:53:53.260 --> 00:53:56.764
that the three people
from the Soviet Union,

00:53:56.764 --> 00:53:59.450
and perhaps others, two or three others

00:53:59.450 --> 00:54:02.209
from behind the Iron Curtain,
wouldn't sign this statement,

00:54:02.209 --> 00:54:04.770
but they did sign the statement

00:54:04.770 --> 00:54:08.350
that we need to have loyalty
to the world as a whole.

00:54:08.350 --> 00:54:11.670
Patriotism is not enough.

00:54:11.670 --> 00:54:16.670
Well, not only patriotism,
but anti-communism

00:54:17.840 --> 00:54:20.650
caused trouble in the peace movement.

00:54:20.650 --> 00:54:23.750
We went to a peace movement in Oxford,

00:54:23.750 --> 00:54:26.900
where my wife and I represented ourselves.

00:54:26.900 --> 00:54:30.410
We came under our own
steam, with our own support

00:54:30.410 --> 00:54:33.690
as we did with many,
most of these activities,

00:54:33.690 --> 00:54:38.030
such as our supporting the symposium

00:54:38.030 --> 00:54:41.060
against the spread of nuclear weapons.

00:54:41.060 --> 00:54:46.060
And representatives of many
organizations came there.

00:54:47.100 --> 00:54:50.320
The British had invited representatives

00:54:50.320 --> 00:54:52.973
from the World Peace Council to come.

00:54:52.973 --> 00:54:57.973
The Americans refused, and they managed

00:54:58.460 --> 00:55:03.460
to prevent the peace meeting
in Oxford from taking place.

00:55:06.820 --> 00:55:11.220
We were there, the others were
there, and it was stopped.

00:55:11.220 --> 00:55:16.010
So, because and there
were other occasions too,

00:55:16.010 --> 00:55:20.810
where it was said that we must be careful,

00:55:20.810 --> 00:55:24.440
not join together with
groups that are dominated

00:55:24.440 --> 00:55:28.670
by communists or by
communist sympathizers.

00:55:28.670 --> 00:55:32.840
Our policy was that we
would sign statements

00:55:32.840 --> 00:55:35.680
that expressed what we believed, no matter

00:55:35.680 --> 00:55:38.640
who else signed the statements.

00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:43.640
When Senator Hennings of Missouri,

00:55:44.350 --> 00:55:48.140
held a hearing in which he was checking

00:55:48.140 --> 00:55:51.303
on the passport office
of the State Department,

00:55:51.303 --> 00:55:56.303
I was called in to
testify about my passport

00:55:57.436 --> 00:56:00.870
being withheld, and the
Assistant Secretary of State

00:56:00.870 --> 00:56:05.210
in charge of passport
affairs was there to testify

00:56:05.210 --> 00:56:08.090
before the Senate committee.

00:56:08.090 --> 00:56:12.357
He was asked, "How did it
happen that Professor Pauling

00:56:12.357 --> 00:56:17.357
"received his passport to
go, in 1954, to Stockholm

00:56:18.167 --> 00:56:21.106
"to get the Nobel Prize in chemistry?

00:56:21.106 --> 00:56:23.830
"Did he appeal, was there an appeal?"

00:56:23.830 --> 00:56:26.610
And the Assistant Secretary of State

00:56:26.610 --> 00:56:31.080
said, "Well, there was a sort
of self generating appeal."

00:56:31.080 --> 00:56:34.900
And here, I've just got some documents

00:56:34.900 --> 00:56:37.200
from the State Department several years

00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:40.950
after I wrote in under
Freedom of Information Act,

00:56:40.950 --> 00:56:43.740
a correspondence in which
the State Department

00:56:43.740 --> 00:56:47.810
officials are discussing
whether it would do more damage

00:56:47.810 --> 00:56:51.370
to the United States
to refuse to let me go

00:56:51.370 --> 00:56:55.795
to get my Nobel Prize or
to let me go to get it,

00:56:55.795 --> 00:56:56.800
and they decided it was better

00:56:56.800 --> 00:57:00.709
to let me go to get the Nobel Prize.

00:57:00.709 --> 00:57:05.709
Well, here, the fact that they objected

00:57:05.830 --> 00:57:10.490
to my traveling abroad
because my anti-communist

00:57:11.379 --> 00:57:12.970
statements are not strong enough

00:57:12.970 --> 00:57:16.430
indicates how important this matter

00:57:16.430 --> 00:57:19.681
of being an anti-communist is.

00:57:19.681 --> 00:57:24.681
In the peace movement too, here we want to

00:57:24.740 --> 00:57:27.720
have peace with the Soviet Union,

00:57:27.720 --> 00:57:30.730
but we don't want to talk with anyone else

00:57:30.730 --> 00:57:34.230
who wants to have peace,
so long as we think

00:57:34.230 --> 00:57:36.950
that he is too friendly
to the Soviet Union,

00:57:36.950 --> 00:57:41.950
or we don't want to talk
with the World Peace Council,

00:57:43.086 --> 00:57:45.290
which is thought to be dominated

00:57:45.290 --> 00:57:48.509
by the Soviet Peace Committee.

00:57:48.509 --> 00:57:53.509
We gave our public lecture in
Moscow to a thousand people

00:57:54.800 --> 00:57:58.810
under the auspices of the
Soviet Peace Committee,

00:57:58.810 --> 00:58:01.647
but this didn't mean, well,

00:58:01.647 --> 00:58:06.647
to go on with Senator
Hennings, Senator Hennings

00:58:07.450 --> 00:58:12.450
said, "Your suggestion," speaking
to the Assistant Secretary

00:58:14.204 --> 00:58:19.204
of State, "that the Paulings, Dr. Pauling,

00:58:19.557 --> 00:58:24.557
"was following the
Soviet line may be wrong.

00:58:24.687 --> 00:58:27.437
"Perhaps the Soviets are
following Dr. Pauling's line."

00:58:28.293 --> 00:58:29.126
(Harry laughs)

00:58:29.126 --> 00:58:31.270
- Dr. Pauling, on that note, and I think

00:58:31.270 --> 00:58:33.070
that the example of your leadership,

00:58:33.070 --> 00:58:35.930
it really points to the
way that we can move

00:58:35.930 --> 00:58:39.050
beyond that particularism,
that nationalism

00:58:39.050 --> 00:58:41.100
that you're talking about
toward a universalism.

00:58:41.100 --> 00:58:44.118
Thank you very much for
sharing your example

00:58:44.118 --> 00:58:46.560
with us and for the future.

00:58:46.560 --> 00:58:48.050
Thank you very much for being with us,

00:58:48.050 --> 00:58:50.380
and thank you very much for joining us

00:58:50.380 --> 00:58:52.687
- [Announcer] On A
Conversation with History.

00:58:52.687 --> 00:58:55.187
