00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.422
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Just like we did before, we need to multiply both sides by the denominator of

00:00:04.422 --> 00:00:08.933
the single fraction on the left-hand side. Status 5x. Isolating x gives us x

00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:13.502
equals 2 over 5. And of course, you want to substitute this back in to check and

00:00:13.502 --> 00:00:14.945
make sure that it works.
