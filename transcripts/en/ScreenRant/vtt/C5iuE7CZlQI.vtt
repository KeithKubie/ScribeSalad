00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:12.320
These days, all people need to do to gain
worldwide exposure is to turn on a camera

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.299
and post a video to YouTube.

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:17.980
The website has become a juggernaut in the
entertainment industry, giving everyone from

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.009
casual fans to professionals a voice to be
heard.

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:24.890
Many people have even turned making YouTube
videos into a living and consistently produce

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.300
content for their subscribers to enjoy.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.180
Some users have become recognizable celebrities
and have worked their way up in the world,

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:32.410
appearing in movies.

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:37.320
Whether it’s straight to VOD indies or major
blockbusters, Hollywood is calling.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.989
Here are 10 famous YouTube stars who have
acted in popular movies.

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:43.570
22 Jump Street &amp; Grown Ups 2

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.340
YouTube has become a hotbed for comedy sketches,
and one of the most popular faces in this

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.300
realm is Jimmy Tatro.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.309
Creator of the channel LifeAccordingToJimmy,
Tatro writes, produces, and directs various

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.699
skits along with a friend.

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:59.850
So far, his videos have accumulated 300 million
views, and he has 2.5 million subscribers

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.730
since he launched the channel in 2010.

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.080
Tatro has parlayed his success into securing
roles in some major comedy productions.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.260
He had a cameo in 2012’s Grown Ups 2 and
played a more substantial role as Rooster

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.990
in Phil Lord and Chris Miller’s 22 Jump
Street.

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.460
He has more movies on the horizon, so his
second career could be getting started.

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.609
Internet Famous

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:22.869
When it comes to popular YouTubers, few can
rival the prowess of Shane Dawson.

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:26.939
The personality is so huge, he has multiple
channels on the website, and combined they

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.590
have 16.4 million subscribers and over 3 billion
total video views.

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.799
According to Forbes, he’s one of the most
famous web celebrities, so of course he would

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:37.409
get a film deal or two.

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.289
In 2016, he appeared in the movie Internet
Famous, a meta comedy in which Internet personalities

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:43.850
enter a talent competition.

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.600
Dawson has also dived into the world of directing,
calling the shots on the teen comedy Not Cool.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.659
He’s carved out a nice living for himself
and should continue his success.

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:54.600
Transformers: Age of Extinction

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.270
Imagine going from YouTube videos to the set
of a Michael Bay film.

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.240
That’s what happened to comedian Kassem
G, whose channel is host to several popular

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.450
web seires including California On and Going
Deep.

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.250
He has more than 2.6 million subscribers and
his videos have been viewed more than 415

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:11.250
million times.

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.640
He even received a Streamy Award for Best
Host, beating out nominees such as Larry King.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.549
His exploits obviously got the attention of
Bay, who cast Kassem as a scientist in the

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:20.970
fourth Transformers film.

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.110
His part was brief, but it must have been
a thrill for the star, and maybe more work

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.819
will come his way.

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:27.819
Nerve

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:31.780
This year’s Nerve is heavily based in YouTube
and Perioscope culture, detailing an Internet

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.709
game where watchers watch players complete
increasingly incredulous tasks.

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.820
So it only makes sense that the producers
would be keen on getting a YouTube talent

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:38.890
to appear in the film.

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.090
Casey Neistat had a role as a player/watcher
in the movie, marking the next step in his

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.140
rise to fame.

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.299
His channel has more than 4 million subscribers
as of August 2016 and a number of his videos

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:50.330
have gone viral and received acclaim.

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.630
He recently won GQ’s New Media Star Man
of the Year award, another indication that

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.480
he is here to stay.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:57.500
Ant-Man

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.120
Everyone from Oscar winners to rock stars
wants in on the Marvel Cinematic Universe,

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.080
and the filmmakers are searching far and wide
for people to appear in their movies.

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.049
Being one of the more comedic MCU films to
date, Ant-Man wanted to get people with a

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:10.250
sense of humor.

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.099
Enter Anna Akana, a YouTuber whose channel
has over 1 million subscribers and more than

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:15.829
100 million video views.

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:19.580
One of her specialties is comedy, which came
into play in her Ant-Man cameo.

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.730
She briefly appeared as one of the people
lip syncing to one of Luis’ long stories

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:27.329
he tells in the film, one of the more entertaining
sequences in the movie.

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:28.939
Star Wars: Episode 8

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:32.569
Newcomer Kelly Marie Tran’s filmography
is brief, and she’s spent most of her time

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:34.530
as an actress appearing in web videos.

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.200
These include roles in several College Humor
original videos, a channel that has more than

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.069
11 million subscribers.

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:43.420
Tran is making the jump to the major leagues
in a daunting way: taking on a supporting

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.880
role in Rian Johnson’s hotly anticipated
Star Wars Episode 8.

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.549
Lucasfilm is keeping the details about her
character under wraps for now, but very soon

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:53.019
all eyes will be on Tran to see what she can
bring to the table.

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:56.090
It’ll be a challenge, but she should be
up for it.

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:57.150
Smosh: The Movie

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.819
Friends Ian Hecox and Anthony Padilla have
been making YouTube videos since 2005, and

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:03.730
since then they’ve had one of the biggest
channels of all-time.

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:09.700
Currently, Smosh has 22 million subscribers
and their videos have accumulated 5.8 billion

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:10.700
views.

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.859
People love watching their comedy sketches,
so there was definitely an audience for a

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:14.859
film.

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:19.570
In 2015, Smosh: The Movie debuted, a comedy
where Ian and Anthony try to delete an embarrassing

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:20.709
clip from the Internet.

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:24.590
The project had a very limited theatrical
release, but it was a smash hit on iTunes,

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:27.229
where it ranked as the #1 comedy film when
it first came out.

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:28.229
Will there be a sequel?

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:29.710
We’ll have to see.

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:30.780
I Know Who Killed Me

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.620
This infamous critical and commercial dud
is best known for ruining Lindsay Lohan’s

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.060
career, but at the time it was made, the hope
was that it would become a breakthrough vehicle

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:39.720
for many of the principal players.

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.680
Among those hoping for a boost was YouTube
star Jessica Rose, creator of the popular

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:44.970
channel Lonelygirl15.

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:49.800
The channel evolved over time, starting as
the blog of a fictional teenager named Bree

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.840
and later became a multicharacter series when
its status as a hoax was uncovered.

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:58.190
Rose had a role as Marcia in I Know Who Killed
Me, but following the reception of the movie,

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:01.090
she might have been better served staying
on the computer screen instead of leaping

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:02.320
to the silver one.

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:03.770
Pitch Perfect 2

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.490
YouTube can be a great tool for artists looking
to gain a wider audience, and many musicians

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:09.320
have taken advantage of the service.

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.389
Chances are, you’ve heard of Flula Borg,
aka DJ Flula.

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:17.770
He’s regularly active on YouTube, gaining
780,000 subscribers and 86 million total views

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:18.770
since he started.

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:23.160
Flula is known for a vlogs and an AutoTunes
series, where he records cover songs in his

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:24.160
car.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.319
He’s also recorded an EP and an LP, displaying
his many musical talents.

00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:31.370
Hollywood took notice and when it came time
to cast Pitch Perfect 2, Flula found himself

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:35.199
as one of the members of “Das Sound Machine,”
a rival group of the Bellas.

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:36.849
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty

00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:40.930
The dream of any movie fan is to one day appear
in a high profile feature film, even if it’s

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:41.930
just a brief cameo.

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:45.960
Alex Anfanger got his start on YouTube doing
movie parodies and is now part of the comedy

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:50.430
channel Nacho Punch, which has more than 985,000
subscribers.

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:53.740
Producers obviously took notice of Anfanger’s
work and decided to put him in a real Hollywood

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:55.160
production in 2013.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:59.009
The personality had a small role in Ben Stiller’s
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, appearing

00:05:59.009 --> 00:06:01.470
as one of Walter’s co-workers who enjoys
making fun of him.

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:05.120
He’s also appeared in multiple television
shows.

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.560
