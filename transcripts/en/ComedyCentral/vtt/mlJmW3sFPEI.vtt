LAST WEEK...

00:00:03.502 --> 00:00:08.941 align:start position:0% line:91%
(LAUGHTER)
OH, (BLEEP) JUST GOT REAL.

00:00:08.974 --> 00:00:12.445 align:start position:0% line:91%
LAST WEEK, THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION AND IRAN IN

00:00:12.478 --> 00:00:16.883 align:start position:0% line:91%
COOPERATION WITH RUSSIA, FRANCE,
BRITAIN, GERMANY AND CHINA,

00:00:16.916 --> 00:00:22.655 align:start size:84% position:16% line:91%
REACHED AN HISTORIC
OUTLINE OF A FRAMEWORK

00:00:22.688 --> 00:00:27.960 align:start position:0% line:91%
OF AN OUTLINE OF A
POTENTIAL DRAFT FOR A PRE-FINAL

00:00:27.993 --> 00:00:34.167 align:start position:0% line:91%
TENTATIVE NUCLEAR DEAL
ARRANGEMENT!

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.201 align:start position:0% line:85%
PENDING APPROVAL.

00:00:35.235 --> 00:00:39.172 align:start position:0% line:91%
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
BUT FIRST, CONGRESS HAS SOME

00:00:39.205 --> 00:00:40.406 align:start position:0% line:85%
CONCERNS.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.777 line:91%
&gt;&gt; THIS DEAL DOESN'T DISMANTLE
ONE CENTRIFUGE, IT DOESN'T CLOSE

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:45.311 align:start position:0% line:85%
ONE SITE.

00:00:45.344 --> 00:00:46.178 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; NO ONE TRUSTS IRAN.

00:00:46.212 --> 00:00:47.379 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I DON'T TRUST THE LEADERSHIP
OF IRAN.

00:00:47.413 --> 00:00:48.881 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN A
CLEAR RECOGNITION ON THEIR PART

00:00:48.914 --> 00:00:51.017 line:91%
THAT ISRAEL HAS A RIGHT TO
EXIST AS A JEWISH STATE.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.119 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I WOULDN'T HAVE STARTED THESE
NEGOTIATIONS TO BEGIN WITH.

00:00:53.152 --> 00:00:54.454 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon: WHAT!

00:00:54.487 --> 00:01:07.934 line:91%
SO I GUESS WE'RE GIVING CEDING
TO LIARS AND ANTI-SEMITES IN A

00:01:07.967 --> 00:01:10.636 align:start position:0% line:91%
NEGOTIATION THAT NEVER
SHOULD HAVE EXISTED BUT

00:01:10.669 --> 00:01:11.870 align:start position:0% line:91%
OTHER THAN THAT,
GOOD FIRST DRAFT.

00:01:11.904 --> 00:01:13.739 line:91%
WHAT COURSE OF ACTION IF NOT A
TREATY WOULD CONGRESS RECOMMEND?

00:01:13.772 --> 00:01:17.043 line:91%
&gt;&gt; SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES OF
WHAT PRESIDENT CLINTON DID IN

00:01:17.076 --> 00:01:21.080 align:start position:0% line:91%
DECEMBER 1998, SEVERAL DAYS OF
AIR AND NAVAL BOMBING

00:01:21.113 --> 00:01:22.248 align:start size:97% position:3% line:91%
AGAINST IRAQ'S WEAPONS OF MASS
DESTRUCTION FACILITIES.

00:01:22.281 --> 00:01:25.818 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon: OH, RIGHT!

00:01:25.851 --> 00:01:29.155 align:start position:0% line:91%
1998, CLINTON SENT MISSILES IN
THERE IN OPERATION I GUESS

00:01:29.188 --> 00:01:30.289 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT'S THAT.

00:01:30.322 --> 00:01:33.926 align:start position:0% line:91%
(LAUGHTER)
YEAH, THAT 1998 BOMBING FIXED

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:38.297 align:start position:0% line:91%
IRAQ FOREVER, TRANSITIONING THAT
COUNTRY FROM A DICTATORSHIP

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.833 align:start position:0% line:91%
TO AN AMERICAN-LOVING
KITTEN-AND-FUDGE-BASED

00:01:40.866 --> 00:01:41.834 align:start position:0% line:85%
DEMOCRACY.

00:01:41.867 --> 00:01:45.204 align:start position:0% line:91%
EVERYONE LOVES A
KITTEN-AND-FUDGE-BASED

00:01:45.237 --> 00:01:49.308 size:84% position:42% line:91%
--DEMOCRACY. BUT THE TRUTH
IS, EVEN IF THE SENATORS --

00:01:49.341 --> 00:01:51.878 align:start position:0% line:85%
(LAUGHTER)

00:01:51.911 --> 00:02:04.423 line:91%
REALLY? HONESTLY, JUST ADDED A
[BLEEP] T. THAT'S ALL WE DID.

00:02:04.456 --> 00:02:09.128 line:91%
EVEN IF THE SENATORS DID THINK
THE DEAL WITH IRAN WAS A GOOD

00:02:09.161 --> 00:02:12.632 align:start position:0% line:91%
DEAL, THE SENATORS WOULD STILL
HAVE TO FULFILL THEIR

00:02:12.665 --> 00:02:13.800 size:81% position:41% line:85%
CONSTITUTIONAL OBLIGATION.

00:02:13.833 --> 00:02:18.404 line:91%
&gt;&gt; NO SENATE OR HOUSE SHOULD
EVER LET ANY PRESIDENT DO AWAY

00:02:18.437 --> 00:02:21.040 line:91%
WITH CONGRESSIONAL SANCTIONS
CREATED BY THE BODIES WITHOUT

00:02:21.073 --> 00:02:22.241 align:start position:0% line:85%
THEIR APPROVAL.

00:02:22.274 --> 00:02:24.844 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I THINK IT'S CRITICAL THAT IS
SENATE APPROVE THIS LIKE WE

00:02:24.877 --> 00:02:26.012 align:start position:0% line:85%
DO ANY TREATY.

00:02:26.045 --> 00:02:29.115 line:91%
&gt;&gt; IT REQUIRES THE ADVICE AND
CONSENT OF THE UNITED STATES

00:02:29.148 --> 00:02:29.816 align:start position:0% line:85%
SENATE.

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:33.085 line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon: SLOW DOWN THERE, McCAIN!

00:02:33.118 --> 00:02:35.421 align:start position:0% line:91%
SENATE'S ALREADY IN SESSION,
LIKE, THREE DAYS A MONTH!

00:02:35.454 --> 00:02:38.191 align:start position:0% line:91%
(LAUGHTER)
YOU DON'T WANT TO OVERLOAD YOUR

00:02:38.224 --> 00:02:39.759 size:75% position:38% line:85%
SCHEDULE, BLOW A GASKET.

00:02:39.792 --> 00:02:40.927 align:start position:0% line:85%
OF COURSE!

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.497 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE CONSTITUTION ALSO GIVES
CONGRESS THE RESPONSIBILITY TO

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.299 align:start position:0% line:85%
DECLARE WAR.

00:02:46.332 --> 00:02:50.903 line:91%
HOW CONCERNED ARE THEY WITH
DEFENDING THAT AUTHORITY FROM

00:02:50.936 --> 00:02:52.038 align:start position:0% line:85%
PRESIDENTIAL OVERREACH?

00:02:52.071 --> 00:02:56.175 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I DON'T WANT TO LIMIT OUR
COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF.

00:02:56.208 --> 00:02:59.378 line:91%
&gt;&gt; THIS RESOLUTION SAYS WIN A
WAR, IT TAKES GROUND TROOPS

00:02:59.411 --> 00:03:00.479 align:start position:0% line:85%
WHEREVER IT TAKES.

00:03:00.512 --> 00:03:11.290 size:88% position:44% line:91%
&gt;&gt; A GUY NAMED RONALD REAGAN
INVADED A SOVEREIGN, SMALL

00:03:11.323 --> 00:03:12.424 align:start position:0% line:91%
SOVEREIGN NATION CALLED
GRENADA, YOU KNOW, AND NOTIFIED

00:03:12.458 --> 00:03:15.261 align:start position:0% line:91%
EVERYBODY THE NEXT MORNING
AFTER, AFTER IT WAS COMPLETED.

00:03:15.294 --> 00:03:17.096 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; CONGRESS SHOULD SORT OF SHUT
UP.

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:21.867 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: THE PRESIDENT NEEDS TO
FOCUS, EVERYBODY!

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.069 align:start position:0% line:85%
HE'S BOMBING PEOPLE!

00:03:23.102 --> 00:03:30.676 line:91%
MY ADVICE IS THAT CONGRESS
CONSENT TO A HOT CUP OF SHUT

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:31.877 align:start position:0% line:85%
THE (BLEEP) UP!

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:32.979 align:start position:0% line:85%
DELAWARE!

00:03:33.012 --> 00:03:34.047 align:start position:0% line:85%
DELAWARE!

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.882 align:start position:0% line:91%
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
DELAWARE, WHEN THE PRESIDENT'S

00:03:36.915 --> 00:03:39.986 line:91%
BOMBING PEOPLE, YOU SO MUCH SAY
A WORD I WILL SHOVE YOU SO FAR

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:45.024 align:start position:0% line:91%
UP MASSACHUSETTS' ASS, YOU WILL
SMELL MAINE!

00:03:45.057 --> 00:03:49.228 align:start position:0% line:85%
(LAUGHTER)

00:03:49.261 --> 00:03:51.163 line:85%
A LOT OF THE TOUGH TALK FROM --

00:03:51.196 --> 00:03:54.567 align:start position:0% line:91%
AS A MATTER OF FACT, CONGRESS IS
SO LAX IN THEIR WAR-MAKING

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:59.238 line:91%
OVERSIGHT, THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF
IS SOMEWHAT UNCOMFORTABLE WITH

00:03:59.271 --> 00:04:02.975 line:91%
THE AMOUNT OF FIRE IN HIS POWER
LIKE HIS DRONE STRIKE AUTHORITY.

00:04:03.008 --> 00:04:06.879 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; ONE OF THE THINGS WE'VE GOT
TO DO IS PUT A LEGAL

00:04:06.912 --> 00:04:09.682 line:91%
ARCHITECTURE IN PLACE AND WE
NEED CONGRESSIONAL HELP TO DO

00:04:09.715 --> 00:04:15.488 line:91%
THAT TO MAKE SURE THAT NOT ONLY
AM I REINED IN BUT ANY PRESIDENT

00:04:15.521 --> 00:04:17.823 align:start position:0% line:91%
IS IN TERMS OF SOME OF THE
DECISIONS WE'RE MAKING.

00:04:17.856 --> 00:04:21.360 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: STOP ME CONGRESS
BEFORE I KILL -- OH, TOO LATE.

00:04:21.393 --> 00:04:25.698 size:88% position:44% line:91%
TURNS OUT, WHEN IT COMES TO
BOMBING COUNTRIES OR SENDING

00:04:25.731 --> 00:04:28.567 line:91%
ADVISORS TO COUNTRIES OR DRONE
STRIKING COUNTRIES, CONGRESS IS

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.803 line:85%
THE GIRL WHO JUST CAN'T SAY NO.

00:04:30.836 --> 00:04:36.575 line:91%
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO COOPERATING
WITH COUNTRIES, TREATIES -- HOLD

00:04:36.608 --> 00:04:37.209 align:start position:0% line:85%
ON THERE!

00:04:37.242 --> 00:04:38.811 size:84% position:42% line:85%
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, MISTER?

00:04:38.844 --> 00:04:42.848 line:91%
LIKE THE SMALL ARMS TREATY TO
STOP THE ILLEGAL INTERNATIONAL

00:04:42.881 --> 00:04:45.584 align:start position:0% line:91%
TRADE OF ARMS RATIFIED BY 66
OTHER COUNTRIES.

00:04:45.617 --> 00:04:50.389 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WHY IN THE WORLD WOULD
SOMEBODY WANT TO GIVE TO CEDE

00:04:50.422 --> 00:04:56.062 line:91%
TO THE UNITED NATIONS OR ANY
MULTI-NATIONAL GROUP THE POWER

00:04:56.095 --> 00:04:58.264 line:91%
TO MAKE DETERMINATIONS AS TO
WHOM, WITH WHOM WE TRADE ARMS.

00:04:58.297 --> 00:05:01.267 line:91%
&gt;&gt; THIS TREATY WILL INFRINGE ON
THE SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS OF

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:02.435 align:start position:0% line:85%
AMERICAN GUN OWNERS.

00:05:02.468 --> 00:05:07.139 line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: BLACK MARKET SOMALI
ARMS TRAFFICKING DOESN'T KILL

00:05:07.172 --> 00:05:08.307 align:start position:0% line:85%
PEOPLE.

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:13.879 line:91%
PEOPLE WHO BUY BLACK MARKET
SOMALI ARMS -- OH, FORGET IT!

00:05:13.912 --> 00:05:17.149 align:start position:0% line:91%
(LAUGHTER)
OR THE LAW OF THE SEA TREATY

00:05:17.182 --> 00:05:24.156 align:start position:0% line:91%
WHICH CREATES GUIDELINES FOR HOW
COUNTRIES CAN RESPONSIBLY USE

00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:25.925 align:start position:0% line:91%
MARINE NATURAL RESOURCES,
RATIFIED BY 167 COUNTRIES OR

00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.760 size:84% position:42% line:85%
IT'S KNOWN, EARTH MINUS US.

00:05:27.793 --> 00:05:32.665 line:91%
&gt;&gt; WHAT IT DOES IN JUST A ONE
SENTENCE FORM IS TO RELINQUISH

00:05:32.698 --> 00:05:34.266 align:start position:0% line:91%
OUR SOVEREIGNTY OVER 70% OF THE
WORLD.

00:05:34.299 --> 00:05:36.669 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: WHAT ARE WE THE
SPANISH ARMADA?

00:05:36.702 --> 00:05:39.972 align:start position:0% line:91%
AS YOU KNOW, AMERICA CURRENTLY
OWNS THE OCEANS.

00:05:40.005 --> 00:05:46.979 line:91%
EVER SINCE PRESIDENT NIXON BLEW
ON NEPTUNE'S FABLED CONCH SHELL

00:05:47.012 --> 00:05:49.715 line:85%
AND BECAME PRINCE OF THE DEEP!

00:05:49.748 --> 00:05:53.519 align:start position:0% line:91%
(LAUGHTER)
OR -- AND THE ONE IS HONESTLY

00:05:53.552 --> 00:05:57.823 line:91%
HARD TO BELIEVE THAT WE WON'T
RATIFY, THE TREATY TO PROMOTE

00:05:57.856 --> 00:06:00.760 align:start position:0% line:91%
RIGHTS FOR THE DISABLED
RATIFIED BY 153 NATIONS.

00:06:00.793 --> 00:06:04.530 line:91%
&gt;&gt; IN ALL HONESTY, I DON'T WANT
TO LOSE OUR SOVEREIGNTY IN THIS

00:06:04.563 --> 00:06:05.664 align:start position:0% line:85%
ISSUE.

00:06:05.698 --> 00:06:06.765 line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: OH! I DON'T WANT SOME
ONE WORLD BLACK HELICOPTER

00:06:06.799 --> 00:06:12.538 size:84% position:42% line:91%
ILLUMINATI COMING HERE AND
TELLING US WHICH RAMP NEEDS

00:06:12.571 --> 00:06:15.841 line:85%
TO GO IN FRONT OF WHICH LIBRARY!

00:06:15.874 --> 00:06:19.645 line:91%
AND IT'S NOT ALWAYS THAT WE'RE
ALWAYS WORKING AGAINST OTHER

00:06:19.678 --> 00:06:22.848 align:start position:0% line:91%
COUNTRIES, WE DO WORK WITH OTHER
COUNTRIES, WE DO IT ALL THE

00:06:22.881 --> 00:06:23.749 align:start position:0% line:85%
TIME.

00:06:23.782 --> 00:06:25.518 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WELL, CERTAINLY WE NEED OTHER
PARTNERS.

00:06:25.551 --> 00:06:27.753 align:start position:0% line:91%
I MEAN, WE NEED THESE OTHER ARAB
COUNTRIES TO STEP IN.

00:06:27.786 --> 00:06:30.022 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THE UNITED STATES MUST BE
COMMITTED TO BUILDING A

00:06:30.055 --> 00:06:33.959 align:start position:0% line:91%
COALITION THAT ASSISTS THE
IRAQI, KURDISH AND FREE SYRIAN

00:06:33.992 --> 00:06:35.093 align:start position:0% line:85%
FORCES.

00:06:35.127 --> 00:06:37.730 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; DEMONSTRATE OUR COMMITMENT TO
THE GLOBAL COALITION IN

00:06:37.763 --> 00:06:40.966 align:start position:0% line:91%
DEFEATING THIS RADICAL ISLAMIC
ORGANIZATION.

00:06:40.999 --> 00:06:44.236 line:91%
&gt;&gt; AMERICAN SOLDIERS NEED TO GO
BACK TO SYRIA AND IRAQ AS PART

00:06:44.269 --> 00:06:46.872 align:start position:0% line:91%
OF THE COALITION --
&gt;&gt; Jon: SEE?

00:06:46.905 --> 00:06:49.141 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU WANT TO WORK WITH THE UNITED
STATES, HUH?

00:06:49.174 --> 00:06:53.512 line:91%
WELL, THERE'S ONLY TWO THINGS
YOU CAN DO WITH RAMPS -- BUILD

00:06:53.545 --> 00:06:55.147 align:start position:0% line:85%
'EM OR BOMB 'EM.

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:57.817 align:start position:0% line:91%
(LAUGHTER)
AND I DON'T SEE NO BUILDING RAMP

00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:58.818 align:start position:0% line:85%
MATERIALS.

00:06:58.851 --> 00:07:01.620 align:start position:0% line:91%
(LAUGHTER)
WHICH BRINGS US TO THE QUESTION,

00:07:01.653 --> 00:07:07.726 line:91%
WHY ARE WE SO (BLEEP) CAUTIOUS
AND UNWILLING TO COOPERATE WITH

00:07:07.759 --> 00:07:11.130 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE GLOBAL COMMUNITY ON
NON-MILITARY AGREEMENTS?

00:07:11.163 --> 00:07:14.500 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WHENEVER A BILL OR A TREATY
IS PASSED, THERE ARE SOME

00:07:14.533 --> 00:07:16.335 size:75% position:38% line:85%
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES.

00:07:16.368 --> 00:07:22.208 line:91%
&gt;&gt; LET'S DO IT WITHOUT ENMESHING
OUR NATION INTO ANOTHER BINDING

00:07:22.241 --> 00:07:24.410 align:start position:0% line:91%
INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION THAT
WILL CAUSE MORE GRIEF THAN

00:07:24.443 --> 00:07:25.511 align:start position:0% line:85%
BENEFIT.

00:07:25.544 --> 00:07:28.314 size:88% position:44% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YOU ALSO NEED TO PAY VERY
CAREFUL ATTENTION TO THOSE

00:07:28.347 --> 00:07:32.718 line:91%
CONSEQUENCES THAT ARE UNINTENDED
BECAUSE THAT IS WHERE THE DANGER

00:07:32.751 --> 00:07:33.886 align:start position:0% line:85%
TRULY LIES.

00:07:33.919 --> 00:07:39.024 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: YES, THE UNINTENDED
CONSEQUENCES OF TRYING TO MAKE

00:07:39.057 --> 00:07:40.192 align:start position:0% line:85%
PEACE!

00:07:40.225 --> 00:07:42.428 align:start position:0% line:91%
OUR CONGRESS IS INCREDIBLY
CAUTIOUS ABOUT TREATIES BECAUSE

00:07:42.461 --> 00:07:49.068 line:91%
YOU NEVER KNOW THE BLOW-BACK
PEACEFUL COOPERATION CAN HAVE!

00:07:49.101 --> 00:07:50.669 align:start position:0% line:85%
