in this video I want to help you gain an

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909
in this video I want to help you gain an
 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:05.420
in this video I want to help you gain an
intuitive understanding of calculus and

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430
intuitive understanding of calculus and
 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.000
intuitive understanding of calculus and
the derivatives now maybe you're

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010
the derivatives now maybe you're
 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.250
the derivatives now maybe you're
thinking that you haven't seen calculus

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260
thinking that you haven't seen calculus
 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.470
thinking that you haven't seen calculus
since your college days and depending on

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480
since your college days and depending on
 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.509
since your college days and depending on
when you graduate maybe that was quite

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519
when you graduate maybe that was quite
 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.180
when you graduate maybe that was quite
some time back now if that's what you're

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190
some time back now if that's what you're
 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.640
some time back now if that's what you're
thinking don't worry you don't need a

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650
thinking don't worry you don't need a
 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.980
thinking don't worry you don't need a

following which is that watch the videos
 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.810
following which is that watch the videos
and then if you could do the homework

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820
and then if you could do the homework
 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.340
and then if you could do the homework
and complete the programming homework

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350
and complete the programming homework
 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.350
and complete the programming homework
successfully then you can apply deep

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360
successfully then you can apply deep
 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.900
successfully then you can apply deep

that in week 4 will define a couple of

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340
that in week 4 will define a couple of
 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.160
that in week 4 will define a couple of
types of functions that will enable you

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170
types of functions that will enable you
 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.110
types of functions that will enable you
to encapsulate everything that needs to

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120
to encapsulate everything that needs to
 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.090
to encapsulate everything that needs to
be done with respect to calculus that

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100
be done with respect to calculus that
 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.590
be done with respect to calculus that
these functions call forward functions

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600
these functions call forward functions
 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.180
these functions call forward functions
and backward functions that you learn

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190
and backward functions that you learn
 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.490
and backward functions that you learn
about the less you put everything you

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500
about the less you put everything you
 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.260
about the less you put everything you

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.910
need to know about counselors into these
functions so that you don't need to

functions so that you don't need to
 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.310
functions so that you don't need to
worry about them anymore beyond that but

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320
worry about them anymore beyond that but
 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.649

I thought that in this foray into deep

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659
I thought that in this foray into deep
 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.080

up the box and peer a little bit further

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799
up the box and peer a little bit further
 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.429
up the box and peer a little bit further
into the details of calculus but really

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439
into the details of calculus but really
 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:14.750
into the details of calculus but really
all you need is an intuitive

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760
all you need is an intuitive
 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.149
all you need is an intuitive

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780
and successfully apply these algorithms
 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.249
and successfully apply these algorithms
oh and finally if you are among that

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259
oh and finally if you are among that
 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.289
oh and finally if you are among that
maybe smaller group of people that are

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299
maybe smaller group of people that are
 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:25.969
maybe smaller group of people that are
expert in calculus if you're very

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979
expert in calculus if you're very
 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.219
expert in calculus if you're very
familiar with calculus observe this it's

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229
familiar with calculus observe this it's
 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.810
familiar with calculus observe this it's
probably okay for you to skip this video

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820
probably okay for you to skip this video
 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.480
probably okay for you to skip this video
but for everyone else let's dive in and

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490
but for everyone else let's dive in and
 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.609
but for everyone else let's dive in and
try to get an intuitive understanding of

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619
try to get an intuitive understanding of
 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.800
try to get an intuitive understanding of
derivatives I've plotted here the

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810
derivatives I've plotted here the
 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.069
derivatives I've plotted here the
function f of a equals 3/8 so it's just

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079
function f of a equals 3/8 so it's just
 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.440
function f of a equals 3/8 so it's just
a straight line to gain intuition about

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450
a straight line to gain intuition about
 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.149
a straight line to gain intuition about
derivatives let's look at a few points

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159
derivatives let's look at a few points
 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.550
derivatives let's look at a few points
on this function let's say that a is

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560
on this function let's say that a is
 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.270
on this function let's say that a is
equal to 2 in that case f of a which is

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280
equal to 2 in that case f of a which is
 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.810
equal to 2 in that case f of a which is
equal to 3 times 8 is equal to 6 so if a

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820
equal to 3 times 8 is equal to 6 so if a
 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.929
equal to 3 times 8 is equal to 6 so if a
is equal to 2 then you know F of a will

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939
is equal to 2 then you know F of a will
 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.149
is equal to 2 then you know F of a will
be equal to 6 let's say we give the

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159
be equal to 6 let's say we give the
 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.920
be equal to 6 let's say we give the
value of a you know just a little bit of

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930
value of a you know just a little bit of
 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.590
value of a you know just a little bit of
a nudge I'm going to just bump up me a

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600
a nudge I'm going to just bump up me a
 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.770
a nudge I'm going to just bump up me a
little bit so there is now 2.00 1 right

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780
little bit so there is now 2.00 1 right
 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.660
little bit so there is now 2.00 1 right
so I'm going to get a like a tiny little

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670
so I'm going to get a like a tiny little
 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.670
so I'm going to get a like a tiny little
nudge to the right so now is let's say 2

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680
nudge to the right so now is let's say 2
 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.030
nudge to the right so now is let's say 2

this is not the scale this is six point
zero zero three so if you look at this

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:34.579
zero zero three so if you look at this

in green what we see is that if I match

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:39.469
in green what we see is that if I match
 

00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:44.319
in green what we see is that if I match
a 0.001 to the right then F of a goes up

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:44.329
a 0.001 to the right then F of a goes up
 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:49.330
a 0.001 to the right then F of a goes up
by 0.03 the amount that F of a went up

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340
by 0.03 the amount that F of a went up
 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.119
by 0.03 the amount that F of a went up
is three times as big as the amount that

00:02:52.119 --> 00:02:52.129
is three times as big as the amount that
 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:54.819
is three times as big as the amount that
I judged a to the right so we're going

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:54.829
I judged a to the right so we're going
 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:58.179
I judged a to the right so we're going
to say that the slope of the derivative

00:02:58.179 --> 00:02:58.189
to say that the slope of the derivative
 

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:02.860
to say that the slope of the derivative
of the function f of a at a equals two

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870
of the function f of a at a equals two
 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.530
of the function f of a at a equals two
or when a is equal to 2 the slope this

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540
or when a is equal to 2 the slope this
 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.839
or when a is equal to 2 the slope this
reading and you know the term derivative

00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:07.849
reading and you know the term derivative
 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:09.640
reading and you know the term derivative
basically means slope is just that

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650
basically means slope is just that
 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.890
basically means slope is just that
derivative sound like a scary a more

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900
derivative sound like a scary a more
 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.869
derivative sound like a scary a more
intimidating word whereas slope is a

00:03:13.869 --> 00:03:13.879
intimidating word whereas slope is a
 

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:16.149
intimidating word whereas slope is a
friendlier way to describe the concept

00:03:16.149 --> 00:03:16.159
friendlier way to describe the concept
 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:17.469
friendlier way to describe the concept
of derivative so one of these year

00:03:17.469 --> 00:03:17.479
of derivative so one of these year
 

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:19.719
of derivative so one of these year
derivative just think slope of the

00:03:19.719 --> 00:03:19.729
derivative just think slope of the
 

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:22.119
derivative just think slope of the
function and more formally the slope is

00:03:22.119 --> 00:03:22.129
function and more formally the slope is
 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:26.140
function and more formally the slope is
defined as the height divided by the

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150
defined as the height divided by the
 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.509
defined as the height divided by the
width of this little triangle that we

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:28.519
width of this little triangle that we
 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:31.750
width of this little triangle that we
have in green so this is you know 0.03

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760
have in green so this is you know 0.03
 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.319
have in green so this is you know 0.03
over 0.01 and the fact that the slope is

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:35.329
over 0.01 and the fact that the slope is
 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:37.119
over 0.01 and the fact that the slope is
equal to 3 or the derivative is equal to

00:03:37.119 --> 00:03:37.129
equal to 3 or the derivative is equal to
 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:39.849
equal to 3 or the derivative is equal to
3 just represents the fact that when you

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:39.859
3 just represents the fact that when you
 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:42.819
3 just represents the fact that when you
watch a to the right by 0.01 by tiny

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:42.829
watch a to the right by 0.01 by tiny
 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:45.969
watch a to the right by 0.01 by tiny
amount the amount that F of a goes up is

00:03:45.969 --> 00:03:45.979
amount the amount that F of a goes up is
 

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:48.729
amount the amount that F of a goes up is
three times as big as the amount that

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739
three times as big as the amount that
 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:51.339
three times as big as the amount that
United the inertial a in the horizontal

00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:51.349
United the inertial a in the horizontal
 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:53.289
United the inertial a in the horizontal
direction so that's all that the slope

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:53.299
direction so that's all that the slope
 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:55.300
direction so that's all that the slope
of a line is now let's look at this

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310
of a line is now let's look at this
 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.520
of a line is now let's look at this
function at a different point let's say

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530
function at a different point let's say
 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.949
function at a different point let's say
that a is now equal to 5

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959
that a is now equal to 5
 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:02.499
that a is now equal to 5
in that case F of a 3 times a is equal

00:04:02.499 --> 00:04:02.509
in that case F of a 3 times a is equal
 

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:05.199
in that case F of a 3 times a is equal
to 15 so let's say I again give a and

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:05.209
to 15 so let's say I again give a and
 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:07.240
to 15 so let's say I again give a and
notch to the right a tiny longnecks is

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250
notch to the right a tiny longnecks is
 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.569
notch to the right a tiny longnecks is
now

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:07.579
now
 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:10.420
now
bumped up to 5 point over 1 F of a is 3

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430
bumped up to 5 point over 1 F of a is 3
 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:11.170
bumped up to 5 point over 1 F of a is 3
times that

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180
times that
 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.890
times that
so f of a is equal to 15 point zero 3

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900
so f of a is equal to 15 point zero 3
 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.189
so f of a is equal to 15 point zero 3
and so once again when I bump into the

00:04:18.189 --> 00:04:18.199
and so once again when I bump into the
 

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:20.769
and so once again when I bump into the
right not a to the right by 0.001

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:20.779
right not a to the right by 0.001
 

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:23.350
right not a to the right by 0.001
F of a goes up three times as much

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360
F of a goes up three times as much
 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.010
F of a goes up three times as much
so the slope again at a equals five is

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020
so the slope again at a equals five is
 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.800
so the slope again at a equals five is
also three so the way we write is that

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810
also three so the way we write is that
 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.350
also three so the way we write is that
the slope of the function f is equal to

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360
the slope of the function f is equal to
 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:38.379
the slope of the function f is equal to
three we say D F of a da and this just

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:38.389
three we say D F of a da and this just
 

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:40.899
three we say D F of a da and this just
means the slope of the function f of a

00:04:40.899 --> 00:04:40.909
means the slope of the function f of a
 

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:43.600

and an alternative way to write this

00:04:49.899 --> 00:04:49.909
and an alternative way to write this
 

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:52.390

also write this as d da of f of a so

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:57.740
also write this as d da of f of a so
 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:00.189
also write this as d da of f of a so
