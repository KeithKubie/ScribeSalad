00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.980
Hey, I am Destin if there is one video you want to share about the eclipse make it this one.

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:06.000
Top 10 things you need to know about eclipse day

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:07.740
In just a couple of minutes.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.280
Number 1 - Know where you're going watch the eclipse from.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.540
There is this thing called the "totality plane". If you're

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.540
inside of it, you see a total eclipse.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.540
If you're outside, you see a partial eclipse.

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.540
Don't freak out about getting right on the mid-line,

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:21.540
If you're a little bit away from it, it's OK,

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.540
You're gonna have a very good experience.

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.940
Plan on traffic, take extra food.

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:27.940
And extra water.
Number 2 - Know exactly when

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:29.940
the eclipse is going to happen. Download this app,

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:31.940
Solar Eclipse Timer. It's going to talk to you

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.940
through the eclipse. Android,

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.940
Apple. Click this button to locate

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.940
where you are inside the totality plane.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:39.940
Click this button.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.940
You are now ready to listen to the events

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.940
of the eclipse.
Number 3 - Know exactly

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.940
what the times mean. C1 is

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.940
when the Moon first touches the Sun. About an hour,

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.940
hour and a half later, C2 is when

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.940
the total eclipse starts.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:53.940
C3 is when the total eclipse ends.

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.940
And C4 is the end of the

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.940
eclipse, the Moon leaves the Sun.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.940
Number 4 - Make sure you have your solar glasses.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.940
Know how to use them. The only time

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.940
you can take them off is between C2 and C3,

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.940
total eclipse. Make sure they're

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.940
"Safe for Direct Solar Viewing".

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:09.940
Number 5 - If you're going to take pictures,

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.940
you have to use a filter.

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.940
You're going to want to take off that filter about

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.940
20 seconds before C2.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:17.940
You're also going to have to change your settings because

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:19.940
the light is changing and you want to be

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:21.940
able to take pictures of the Corona.

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.940
Have a plan.
Number 6 - Look for

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.940
Shadow Bands. They're like shadow snakes on the ground

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.940
just before and just after the eclipse.

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:29.940
If you're going to video it, lay out a white sheet,

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.940
know where North is. It's really interesting

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.940
and scientists don't know why they happen.

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.940
Number 7 - Observe the environment around you.

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.940
Temperature is going to drop, crickets are going to chirp,

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.940
animals are going to do weird things,

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:41.940
people are going to get really excited.

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.940
Watch the stuff around you. 
Number 8 -

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:45.940
If you're a photographer, there's 3 things you want to get.

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:47.940
The Diamond Ring, Bailey's Beads,

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.940
and the Corona. I made a video on how to do that.

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:51.940
Number 9 - At max totality, get your

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:53.940
face away from the gear and just

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.940
take it all in. The 360Â° horizon

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.940
is going to be coloured.

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:59.940
It's going to be amazing. That's the moment where

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.940
you just need to experience it, interact with your family,

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.940
I'm excited about that part.

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.940
Number 10 - Tell other people, if they know

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.940
exactly the cool science stuff to look

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.940
for during the eclipse, it going to be

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.940
a way more awesome experience.

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.940
So tell people. I've left a checklist

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.940
at smartereveryday.com/eclipse

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.940
Go get that and use it on

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.940
Eclipse Day. I hope you love it

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.940
I hope you have a great time.

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.940
That's all the information I could cram into a very short video about the eclipse

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.940
Please consider sharing this with anybody

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.940
that's gonna go.

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.940
I know we think about sharing videos, actually share

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.940
this one because this will completely enhance

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.940
people's experience. I'm Destin,

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.940
You're getting Smarter Every Day.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.940
Have a good one. Please share the video.

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.940
I'd appreciate it. Bye ! I am practicing

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.940
how to be sad because

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.940
of clouds. So I'm ready for the eclipse !

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.940
Owww....

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.940
Yeah, it's working.
