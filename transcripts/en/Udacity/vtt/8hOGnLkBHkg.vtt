00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.172
Since we're thinking about powers, I'd like to backtrack for a second and deal

00:00:04.172 --> 00:00:08.467
with an equation involving a real number. Can you tell me what the solution to X

00:00:08.467 --> 00:00:12.448
squared equals 3 is? I'd like you to write this as an exact answer, not as a

00:00:12.448 --> 00:00:16.724
decimal. And remember to be careful about what happens when you want to get rid

00:00:16.724 --> 00:00:20.862
of an exponent. Make sure that you cover all of the possible solutions for X.
