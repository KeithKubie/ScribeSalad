00:00:00.258 --> 00:00:02.649
- [Voiceover] Alright, in this video,

00:00:02.649 --> 00:00:06.482
we're gonna be multiplying
monomials together.

00:00:08.194 --> 00:00:12.084
Let me give you an example of a monomial.

00:00:12.084 --> 00:00:14.584
4x squared, that's a monomial.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.359
Now, why?

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:21.526
Well, mono means one, which
refers to the number of terms.

00:00:24.892 --> 00:00:28.157
So this 4x squared, this is all one term.

00:00:28.157 --> 00:00:30.687
So we're gonna be working
with things like that.

00:00:30.687 --> 00:00:33.291
What won't we be working with?

00:00:33.291 --> 00:00:36.208
Well what about 4x squared plus 5x.

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.975
How many terms are there?

00:00:38.975 --> 00:00:41.491
4x squared's the first
term, 5x is the second term,

00:00:41.491 --> 00:00:43.658
so this is not a monomial,

00:00:44.538 --> 00:00:48.705
this is actually called a
binomial, because bi means two.

00:00:50.503 --> 00:00:54.180
Like your bicycle's got
two wheels, for example.

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.081
So not yet, go on to the future videos

00:00:56.081 --> 00:00:57.383
if you're ready for binomials.

00:00:57.383 --> 00:00:58.550
But we're just gonna be working

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.803
with multiplying monomials together.

00:01:00.803 --> 00:01:03.886
So can we grab an example to look at.

00:01:06.465 --> 00:01:10.033
By the end of this video,
it should be very easy

00:01:10.033 --> 00:01:13.866
for you to multiply this
monomial, 5x squared,

00:01:15.926 --> 00:01:18.135
by this monomial.

00:01:18.135 --> 00:01:21.334
And I'm actually just gonna
give you the answer right here.

00:01:21.334 --> 00:01:22.972
And then I'm gonna slowly
walk you through some other

00:01:22.972 --> 00:01:25.269
questions that will lead us to why.

00:01:25.269 --> 00:01:28.936
But the answer to this
is 20x to the eighth.

00:01:31.977 --> 00:01:33.376
20x to the eighth.

00:01:33.376 --> 00:01:35.392
Take a look at that, see if
you can notice a pattern.

00:01:35.392 --> 00:01:37.785
What did we do with the five
and the four to get the 20?

00:01:37.785 --> 00:01:40.780
What did we do with the two
and the six to get the eight?

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.467
That's getting a little
ahead of ourselves though.

00:01:43.467 --> 00:01:44.897
Before we can dive in there,

00:01:44.897 --> 00:01:48.086
let's remember some of
the exponent properties.

00:01:48.086 --> 00:01:49.393
A very specific exponent property

00:01:49.393 --> 00:01:51.723
that you should've seen before.

00:01:51.723 --> 00:01:55.280
If we look at five squared
times five to the fourth power,

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.236
what's that going to equal?

00:01:57.236 --> 00:01:59.814
Well, if you remember
your exponent property,

00:01:59.814 --> 00:02:03.795
we'll do a quick reminder
here, I always add my exponent.

00:02:03.795 --> 00:02:06.072
So five squared times
five to the fourth power

00:02:06.072 --> 00:02:08.734
is equal to five to the sixth power.

00:02:08.734 --> 00:02:10.553
What about three to the fourth power

00:02:10.553 --> 00:02:13.639
times three to the fifth power?

00:02:13.639 --> 00:02:16.747
Well, again, I always add my exponents.

00:02:16.747 --> 00:02:20.049
Four plus five is three
to the ninth power,

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:23.596
and my base of three stays the same.

00:02:23.596 --> 00:02:25.558
Great, so if you remember that,

00:02:25.558 --> 00:02:27.321
now we're ready to really start

00:02:27.321 --> 00:02:29.646
multiplying monomials that are new to you.

00:02:29.646 --> 00:02:31.402
And the new thing there
is that we are going

00:02:31.402 --> 00:02:33.802
to have variables involved.

00:02:33.802 --> 00:02:37.969
So let's start, let's take a
look at two monomials here.

00:02:39.462 --> 00:02:44.215
The first monomial is 4x,
and the second one is just x.

00:02:44.215 --> 00:02:47.819
And the four, I don't have
another number to multiply by,

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:48.840
just got the four.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.335
And can I simplify x times x?

00:02:51.335 --> 00:02:54.252
Well, that's equal to x squared.

00:02:55.388 --> 00:02:56.697
Remember if I just have a variable,

00:02:56.697 --> 00:02:59.740
and there's no exponent there,

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.562
it's equivalent to having a one,

00:03:01.562 --> 00:03:04.610
so x to the first power
times x to the first power,

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.247
I add my exponents like
we just talked about,

00:03:07.247 --> 00:03:09.630
and one plus one is equal to two.

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.297
Great, so let's move
on to another one here.

00:03:15.235 --> 00:03:17.068
If I have 4t times 3t.

00:03:19.058 --> 00:03:22.990
Well, four times three
is gonna be equal to 12,

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:26.486
so I've combined my coefficients.

00:03:26.486 --> 00:03:30.688
And then t times t, again,
think of a one being there,

00:03:30.688 --> 00:03:32.771
is going to be t squared.

00:03:35.588 --> 00:03:38.027
So the answer here is 12t squared.

00:03:38.027 --> 00:03:40.234
So let's keep going,

00:03:40.234 --> 00:03:42.145
and once you get into the rhythm of these,

00:03:42.145 --> 00:03:44.202
they become pretty alright.

00:03:44.202 --> 00:03:48.199
So what if I had 4p to
the fifth power times,

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:50.866
let's say 5p to the third power.

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:54.274
What would that equal?

00:03:54.274 --> 00:03:56.304
Well you're gonna notice a pattern here

00:03:56.304 --> 00:03:57.565
that we've been pickin' up on,

00:03:57.565 --> 00:04:00.641
which is that I'm always gonna
multiply my coefficients,

00:04:00.641 --> 00:04:04.058
so four times five, is going to equal 20.

00:04:05.741 --> 00:04:09.162
And I'm always going to add my exponents.

00:04:09.162 --> 00:04:12.162
So p to the fifth and p to the third

00:04:14.649 --> 00:04:16.732
is p to the eighth power.

00:04:18.972 --> 00:04:21.764
so I multiply four and five til we get 20,

00:04:21.764 --> 00:04:25.264
I add five and three to get eight.

00:04:25.264 --> 00:04:27.033
And if you really wanted
to see why that is,

00:04:27.033 --> 00:04:28.867
let's really dive in
here and let's break down

00:04:28.867 --> 00:04:31.819
this first term, let's
break down 4p to the fifth.

00:04:31.819 --> 00:04:33.889
I can write that out as four times p,

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:38.056
times p, times p, times p,
times p, that's five of 'em.

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:40.737
That's four and five p's.

00:04:40.737 --> 00:04:42.683
And then that second term I can write as

00:04:42.683 --> 00:04:45.766
times five times p, times p, times p.

00:04:47.146 --> 00:04:50.695
What I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna group my numbers,

00:04:50.695 --> 00:04:52.145
cause I can work with numbers together,

00:04:52.145 --> 00:04:55.480
so let's put four times
five at the very front,

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.961
and then it just becomes a
matter of how many p's do I have?

00:04:58.961 --> 00:05:01.387
We'll put all of those together as well.

00:05:01.387 --> 00:05:05.137
So I had five p's, so
there's the first five,

00:05:06.113 --> 00:05:08.163
and then I had three more.

00:05:08.163 --> 00:05:11.532
And we can simplify this
crazy looking expression

00:05:11.532 --> 00:05:14.849
by just multiplying my four
and my five to be my 20,

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:18.438
and then writing this with an exponent,

00:05:18.438 --> 00:05:20.507
that's the beauty of exponents,
that's why we have 'em,

00:05:20.507 --> 00:05:23.468
is we can write a crazy
expression like that

00:05:23.468 --> 00:05:24.677
as p to the eighth,

00:05:24.677 --> 00:05:26.911
and you'll notice that this is, of course,

00:05:26.911 --> 00:05:29.593
what we got the first time.

00:05:29.593 --> 00:05:30.426
So great.

00:05:34.707 --> 00:05:36.979
What about 5y to the sixth times

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:39.646
negative 3y to the eighth power?

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:49.577
Again, multiply the
coefficients, add the exponents,

00:05:52.663 --> 00:05:55.746
and I've got a simplified expression.

00:05:56.655 --> 00:05:59.227
Let's get really crazy here,
let's have a little fun.

00:05:59.227 --> 00:06:01.301
So we've noticed the pattern,
let's have a little fun.

00:06:01.301 --> 00:06:04.128
Just saying, I can, I can do more.

00:06:04.128 --> 00:06:07.128
Negative 9x to the fifth power times

00:06:13.369 --> 00:06:16.536
negative three, use parentheses there,

00:06:17.662 --> 00:06:19.153
when you have a negative in front,

00:06:19.153 --> 00:06:20.417
you always wanna use parentheses.

00:06:20.417 --> 00:06:23.167
Let's do x to the 107th power.

00:06:25.178 --> 00:06:27.255
If I would have showed you
this before this video,

00:06:27.255 --> 00:06:28.637
you would have said oh my goodness,

00:06:28.637 --> 00:06:30.740
there's nothing I can do, I'm boxed,

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:32.470
there's no way out.

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:36.083
But now you know that it's as
simple as follow the rules.

00:06:36.083 --> 00:06:38.787
We're going to multiply the coefficients,

00:06:38.787 --> 00:06:42.166
negative nine times negative three is 27.

00:06:42.166 --> 00:06:45.229
Two negatives is a positive
and nine times three is 27.

00:06:45.229 --> 00:06:47.771
I'm gonna add my powers.

00:06:47.771 --> 00:06:51.188
Five plus 107 is a hundred, ooh, not two,

00:06:54.435 --> 00:06:58.109
that was almost a mistake I made there.

00:06:58.109 --> 00:07:00.667
Let's get rid of that, give
me a second chance here.

00:07:00.667 --> 00:07:02.660
Life's all about second chances,

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:04.410
five plus 107 is 112.

00:07:06.695 --> 00:07:09.424
And so, this crazy expression,

00:07:09.424 --> 00:07:12.651
which is two monomials, here's the first,

00:07:12.651 --> 00:07:16.865
here's the second, when
we multiply and simplify

00:07:16.865 --> 00:07:20.511
we get another monomial,
which is 27x to the 112th.

00:07:20.511 --> 00:07:24.251
I'm gonna leave you on a cliffhanger here.

00:07:24.251 --> 00:07:27.591
Which, I'm gonna show you a problem.

00:07:27.591 --> 00:07:30.296
What variable should we use?

00:07:30.296 --> 00:07:31.785
You notice I've been trying
to vary the variables up

00:07:31.785 --> 00:07:34.705
to show you that it just doesn't matter.

00:07:34.705 --> 00:07:35.959
That's an ugly five,
let's get rid of that.

00:07:35.959 --> 00:07:38.547
Give me a second chance with that one too.

00:07:38.547 --> 00:07:41.797
So let's look at 5x to the third power,

00:07:45.942 --> 00:07:48.275
times 4x to the sixth power.

00:07:51.211 --> 00:07:53.393
And I'm gonna show you a wrong answer.

00:07:53.393 --> 00:07:55.736
I had a student that asked to do this,

00:07:55.736 --> 00:07:58.448
and here's the wrong
answer that they gave me.

00:07:58.448 --> 00:08:01.281
They told me 9x to the 18th power.

00:08:03.425 --> 00:08:04.424
That's terribly wrong.

00:08:04.424 --> 00:08:05.422
What did they do wrong?

00:08:05.422 --> 00:08:07.161
What did they do wrong?

00:08:07.161 --> 00:08:08.719
I want you to think to yourself,

00:08:08.719 --> 00:08:10.048
what have we been talking about?

00:08:10.048 --> 00:08:11.724
What did they do with the five
and the four to get the nine?

00:08:11.724 --> 00:08:13.336
What should they have done?

00:08:13.336 --> 00:08:15.934
What did they do with the three
and the six to get the 18,

00:08:15.934 --> 00:08:18.243
and what should they have done?

00:08:18.243 --> 00:08:21.743
That's multiplying monomials by monomials.
