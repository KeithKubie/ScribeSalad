[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:10.030
PHILIP NEL: So was the
Cat in the Hat black,

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:15.400
and what on earth do I
mean by that question?

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.590
I mean, he's a cat, isn't he?

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.240
Sure, he's a cartoon
cat who walks upright,

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.890
who wears a red and
white striped top

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.970
hat and a kind of garish bow
tie and carries an umbrella,

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.610
but he's a cat--

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:31.570
probably.

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:33.010
Maybe?

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.805
I'll answer my title
question in a moment.

00:00:35.805 --> 00:00:37.180
But first, I should
say that I've

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.050
made the question, the title
question, because, as Robin

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.860
Bernstein has noted, racism
sneaks into children's culture

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.860
under the cloak of
innocence, and once there, it

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.830
continues to influence
the broader culture.

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:52.630
I've made this the
title of the book

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:56.320
because racial and
racist images persist

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.990
in the cultures of
childhood, often in ways

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:03.250
that we don't notice
on a conscious level.

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.160
This is why in children's
books and culture,

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.990
race is present, especially
when it seems to be absent.

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:12.760
And Dr. Seuss's
"The Cat in the Hat"

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.150
illuminates the ways in
which images from the past

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.200
continue to haunt the present
and apparently discarded

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.840
racial ideas linger on.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.810
"The Cat in the Hat" is
racially complicated,

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:31.720
inspired by blackface caricature
and by actual people of color.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.210
One story of the
book's origins is

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.560
that in 1955, William Spaulding,
director of Houghton Mifflin's

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.920
educational division, thought
that Dr. Seuss could solve

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.410
the "Why Johnny Can't Read"
crisis by writing reading

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.970
primers that children actually
enjoyed reading, instead

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.220
of Dick and Jane, which
children did not enjoy reading.

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.050
So as Seuss rode the elevator
up to Spaulding's office,

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:58.240
he noticed that the
elevator operator

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.710
was an elegant, petite
African-American woman who

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.310
wore white gloves
and a secret smile.

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.949
Her name was Annie
Williams, and in response

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:10.389
to Spaulding's challenge--

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:13.060
"Write me a story that first
graders can't put down"--

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.750
Seuss wrote "The
Cat in the Hat,"

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.250
giving the protagonist Mrs.
Williams's white gloves,

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.620
her sly smile, and her color.

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.020
A source for the
cat's red bow tie

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.440
is Krazy Kat, the
ambiguously gendered creation

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.930
of biracial cartoonist
George Herriman.

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.380
Seuss also draws on the
traditions of minstrelsy,

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.450
an influence that emerges
first in a minstrel show

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.160
that he wrote and performed
in in blackface while

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.190
in high school.

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.570
In fact, blackface
minstrelsy recurs

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:46.960
in Seuss's early cartoons, in
20th century popular culture,

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.870
and its traces linger
on in many other icons

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.790
of children's literature.

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.096
As Robin Bernstein says--

00:02:53.096 --> 00:02:54.720
I'm going to quote
her here at length--

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.130
"Children's culture
has a special ability

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.730
to preserve even as it
distorts and transmit

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.880
even as it fragments the
blackface mask and styles

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.850
of movement which persist
not only in Raggedy

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.300
Ann and the Scarecrow but also
in the faces and gloved hands

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.880
of Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny."

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.200
And to her list we
can add Seuss's cat.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.950
And what makes the
cat so interesting

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.860
and so representative-- and why
he's the title of the book--

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:22.390
is that during the
very same decade

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.070
that "The Cat in the
Hat" was published,

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.280
Seuss was both speaking
out against racism

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.070
and recycling racist
caricature in his books.

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:35.730
So in a 1952 essay, he pointedly
critiques racist humor.

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.770
In 1953, inspired by his
opposition to anti-Semitism,

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:40.740
he writes "The Sneetches."

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.750
And then, the same
year as Brown v. Board

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.390
of Education, the
landmark Supreme Court

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:51.220
case that ostensibly made school
segregation illegal in the US,

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.820
"Horton Hears a Who"
presents the Whos' smallness

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.430
as an arbitrary mark of
difference for which they

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.980
are unfairly penalized.

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.890
One review at the time said
that Horton's refrain--

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.140
"A person's a person,
no matter how small"--

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.680
was, quote, "a rhymed lesson
in protection of minorities

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.060
and their rights."

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.960
And yet, in the same decade,
in "If I Ran the Zoo,"

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.930
Gerald McGrew proposes going
to the African island of Yerka

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.610
to bring back a
tizzle-topped Tufted

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:22.450
Mazurka, who sits on a perch
carried by two African men.

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:25.930
And suggesting a kinship with
animals, the two nearly naked

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.030
Africans have tufts
on their heads

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.850
that resemble the tuft
on the head of the bird.

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:32.830
Their faces really
seem to come straight

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:35.620
out of Seuss's early cartoons.

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.720
The same book offers a
visit to "the mountains

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.700
of Zomba-ma-Tant
with helpers who

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.520
wear their eyes at a slant."

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.760
Meanwhile, "Scrambled Eggs
Super!", also from the '50s,

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.690
invites us to laugh at Ali, a
gullible Arab being attacked

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:51.980
by hundreds of angry Mt.

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:53.760
Strookoo Cuckoos.

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.730
Dr. Seuss's work is both
racist and opposes racism

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:00.460
and does both in
the same decade.

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.560
These characters and the
cat's minstrel ancestry

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.870
reveal Seuss's
racial unconscious,

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.830
indicating how his
imagination resuscitated

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:13.140
and revised early 20th century
and 19th century stereotypes.

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:17.790
His career also reminds us that
you don't need to be a Klansman

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:23.040
or, say, Donald Trump, to
participate in white supremacy.

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.110
Recognizing the Cat
in the Hat's ancestry

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.740
in both blackface performance
and African-American culture

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.500
makes visible three ways in
which American picture books

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.620
have been a battleground in
the fight against racism.

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.560
First, just as recognizing
how black voices shaped

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.370
"Huckleberry Finn," the book
from which I stole my title,

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.740
helps us to desegregate
American children's literature--

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:45.900
American literature, excuse me--

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.900
so understanding how black
voices and blackface created

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.120
Seuss's "The Cat in
the Hat" assists us

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.340
in desegregating
children's literature.

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:57.210
Seuss's work is not only heir
to the nonsense of Lewis Carroll

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:59.880
and Edward Lear
and Hilaire Belloc,

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:03.660
it's also heir to that of E.
W. Campbell in its stereotypes

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:07.800
and Langston Hughes in opposing
those same stereotypes.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.810
Second, in the '50s,
American readers

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:12.180
of children's literature
saw animal characters

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:14.460
as distinctly racialized.

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:17.320
In fact, in both racist
and anti-racist children's

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.650
literature, differences
between animals

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:21.990
have had a long
history of representing

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:25.260
differences between and
similarities among races.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.620
So in 1959, racist
Southerners accused this book,

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:31.020
Garth Williams's "The
Rabbits' Wedding,"

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:34.320
of promoting integration and
demanded that the book be

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:36.450
removed from libraries.

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:40.140
In the book a white rabbit
marries a black rabbit.

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:44.250
This became a national
news story at the time.

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:47.220
The third reason for
thinking about the cat's

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:51.060
minstrel ancestry
is that borrowing

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:54.270
from American iconography,
the Cat in the Hat

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:57.720
and the minstrel both dramatize
the moral contradictions

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:59.820
at the heart of
the United States,

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:02.880
a country founded both on
slavery and, paradoxically,

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:04.770
on the idea of freedom.

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:07.110
As a response to the "Why
Johnny Can't Read" crisis,

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:10.320
the cat offered the hope that
his exciting, poetic narrative

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:13.920
would make literacy available
to all American children.

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:16.770
But despite Brown v.
Board of Education

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:19.560
three years before,
libraries remained

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:21.900
segregated in most states.

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:24.900
Black students don't have
access to the same materials

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:26.400
that white students had.

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:28.800
So if the cat represents all
American children's right

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:31.800
to literacy, he also masks
a separate but unequal

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:33.420
educational system.

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:36.540
He embodies the discrepancy
between the ideals

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:40.350
and the realities of America
in the 1950s and today,

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:42.960
which is why "Was the
Cat in the Hat Black?"

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:44.970
is the title of the book.

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:47.520
But-- and I'm sorry
to disappoint here--

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:49.500
the book is not only
about Dr. Seuss.

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:52.920
Really, only the first
chapter focuses on Dr. Seuss.

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:55.560
Each chapter of "Was the
Cat in the Hat Black?"

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:59.550
addresses the often unseen
ways in which racism persists

00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:01.470
in children's literature.

00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:03.870
Racism endures because
racism is structural.

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:07.144
It's embedded in culture,
embedded in institutions.

00:08:07.144 --> 00:08:09.060
And my argument-- and
I'm not the first person

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:11.601
to make this argument-- is that
one of the places that racism

00:08:11.601 --> 00:08:14.310
hides and one of the
best places to oppose it

00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:16.320
is books for young people.

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:18.430
What we learn as children
shapes our world views

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:21.600
so profoundly because
when we are small,

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:25.260
we are still in the process
of figuring out who we are

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.000
and what we believe.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.430
For this reason, children's
books, children's toys,

00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:33.210
and children's culture are
some of the most important

00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:37.320
influences on who we
become and on what biases

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:39.179
we harbor or don't harbor.

00:08:39.179 --> 00:08:40.679
And so we need to
ask hard questions

00:08:40.679 --> 00:08:42.990
and have uncomfortable
conversations

00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:45.060
about the children's books
and children's culture

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:46.590
that we consume.

00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:50.000
And this will be
upsetting for some people.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.930
Dr. Seuss Enterprises
for example,

00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:54.390
the corporate entity that
oversees the licensing

00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:56.310
and production of
all things Seuss,

00:08:56.310 --> 00:09:01.260
would really, really prefer
that Seuss's own racism

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:02.880
not be discussed.

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:06.150
When I wrote the official
biography for the Seussville

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:09.360
website, I was asked to cut
any mention of stereotypes

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:13.170
in the cartoons, even though my
narrative tried to frame this

00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:17.160
in a positive way, noting
that in his later work Seuss

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:22.380
actively opposed stereotypes,
which he did and also didn't.

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:23.990
Since I wanted to
be paid for the job,

00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:25.740
I cut that, although
I have included

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:29.190
that story in this book
and right now in this talk.

00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:32.280
Seuss Enterprises' resistance
exemplifies the problem.

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:34.530
The failure to discuss
our work honestly

00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:37.170
helps sustain racism in
children's literature

00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:38.160
and culture.

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:40.050
To borrow the words
of Robin DiAngelo,

00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:42.300
who I'll come to again
later in the talk,

00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:44.520
"A continual retreat
from the discomfort

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:46.650
of authentic racial
engagement results

00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:50.550
in a perpetual cycle that
works to hold racism in place."

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:52.200
And if we're ever
to break that cycle,

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:54.390
we need to experience
that discomfort,

00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:57.380
to have those uncomfortable
conversations.

00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:59.460
And this may seem
counterintuitive,

00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:02.670
but I argue that actually,
racist classics of children's

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:05.930
literature can help us initiate
those uncomfortable but

00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:07.760
necessary conversations.

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:10.100
Now, I completely
understand why people

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:13.340
would want to erase the racism
from books for young people,

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:16.920
changing the offensive portions
of "Huck Finn," "Charlie

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:19.670
and the Chocolate Factory,"
"Doctor Doolittle," "Mary

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:21.167
Poppins," and many other books--

00:10:21.167 --> 00:10:23.000
which is something that
happens, by the way,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.041
in children's literature.

00:10:24.041 --> 00:10:26.810
Books get changed, get altered
to try to clean them up.

00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:29.060
And this seems to
offer us a way to keep

00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:31.280
a literary work
available and accessible

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:34.550
without inflicting harm
upon young readers.

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:38.720
And to be clear, racist texts
can inflict real psychic damage

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:40.830
on children of all races.

00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:43.370
But the child who is a
member of the targeted group

00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:46.730
bears a much heavier burden
than the child who is not.

00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:49.490
The racism in these books all
but ensure that children who

00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:52.280
are and have historically been
the targets of prejudice will

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:55.280
suffer in ways that
white children won't.

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:59.240
So the 1988 edition of
Lofting's "Doctor Doolittle"

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:01.400
removes all references
to skin color

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:04.130
and Prince Bumpo no
longer wishes to be white.

00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:07.430
The bird Polynesia instead
tricks him through hypnosis.

00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:10.650
In 1973, Roald Dahl
revised his own "Charlie

00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:12.110
and the Chocolate Factory."

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:14.450
Instead of African
Pygmies, the Oompa-Loompas

00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:17.840
become small white
people from Oompaland.

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:20.360
P. L. Travers rewrote
the "Bad Tuesday" chapter

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:23.796
of "Mary Poppins" twice, in
1967 to remove the dialect

00:11:23.796 --> 00:11:25.670
from the people that
they meet as they travel

00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:30.020
around the world, and in
1981 to remove the people

00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:32.330
and replace them with animals.

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:34.820
And quite famously,
fairly recently,

00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:37.730
Alan Gribben's 2011 edition of
"The Adventures of Huckleberry

00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:41.720
Finn" replaces all instances
of "nigger" with "slave"

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:44.300
and all instances of
"Injun" with "Indian."

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:46.220
And that is a lot of changes.

00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:51.050
Twain uses the n-word 219
times in "Huckleberry Finn."

00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:54.080
And for this very reason,
there is a very strong case

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:57.020
to be made for removing
racist books from grade

00:11:57.020 --> 00:11:59.480
school and high school
curricula altogether.

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:02.480
Julius Lester, for example, has
said that he is "grateful that

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:05.540
among the many indignities
inflicted on me in childhood,

00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:09.020
I escaped 'Huckleberry Finn.'"
He adds that as a black parent,

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:11.390
he sympathizes with those
who want the book banned,

00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:13.610
or at least removed from
required reading lists

00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:14.870
in schools.

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:17.830
In fact, we can develop his
line of argument even further

00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:20.510
and argue that the best
way to hasten the decline

00:12:20.510 --> 00:12:24.050
of a racist classic and thus
the racism that it may propagate

00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:26.860
is just not to teach
it at all at any level.

00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:30.780
And that's a strong argument,
and I respect that argument.

00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:33.720
I'm going to make a slightly
different argument here,

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:35.940
and that is that
ignoring the symptoms

00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:37.980
does not cure the
disease and that it

00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:40.950
is more risky to ban the
racist books outright

00:12:40.950 --> 00:12:43.620
or to use only the
bowdlerized editions.

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:46.380
And for those who may not
know the term, to "bowdlerize"

00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:48.450
is to clean up an
offensive text.

00:12:48.450 --> 00:12:50.130
The term comes from
Thomas Bowdler,

00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:51.960
who did this to
Shakespeare 200 years ago

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:54.350
and created "The
Family Shakespeare,"

00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:58.680
a Shakespeare for children
that would not provide

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:00.397
them inappropriate material.

00:13:00.397 --> 00:13:02.730
So rather than bowdlerize,
rather than edit these books,

00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:05.550
I think it's a less risky
choice to teach them critically,

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:08.610
helping students see the ways
in which the books reinforce

00:13:08.610 --> 00:13:12.270
racism and engaging in
painful, but I think necessary,

00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:13.500
conversations.

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:16.380
And this is why, just
as popular characters

00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:19.770
like the Cat in the Hat,
Mickey Mouse, and Bugs Bunny

00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:22.050
naturalize their own
minstrel origins,

00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:24.330
so bowdlerized versions
of classic books

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:29.100
normalize the racism that
revisionists aspire to expunge.

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:32.240
Attempts to erase
racism from these books

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:35.010
don't actually get rid
of racist ideologies.

00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:37.440
They just make them
more insidious.

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:41.280
They make them less obvious and
thus more difficult to resist.

00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:43.470
So in the revised
version of "Charlie

00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:46.530
and the Chocolate Factory,"
the Oompa-Loompas still happily

00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:50.880
acquiesce to being shipped to
England in large packing cases,

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:53.070
and they find life in
a factory preferable

00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:55.860
to life in their native land.

00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:58.440
They still submit to
enslavement happily.

00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:00.650
Similarly, removing
references to skin color

00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:03.960
in "Doctor Doolittle" does
not also remove colonialism.

00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:06.600
Dr. Doolittle remains an
enlightened white European who

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:09.000
goes to civilize the natives.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.980
In all cases, trying
to remove the racism

00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:14.670
and colonialism just more
subtly encodes the same racial

00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:16.380
and colonial messages.

00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:18.450
Cleaning up these texts
just makes those messages

00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:21.270
harder to spot and
harder to oppose.

00:14:21.270 --> 00:14:23.160
So a better
approach, I think, is

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:26.470
to read the originals with
children-- and of course,

00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:29.340
in the context of other
books that present racism

00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:32.100
and present
colonialism critically.

00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:34.560
Here are three
benefits of doing so.

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:37.880
First, as Brigitte Fielder
noted after I presented

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:40.530
a version of this
chapter at a conference,

00:14:40.530 --> 00:14:42.750
"The decision to
talk about racism

00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:45.210
is a position of privilege."

00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:46.650
I mention this
because some people

00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:49.260
may question the wisdom
of talking about racism

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:51.480
with young children.

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:54.974
But that is a
question or a comment

00:14:54.974 --> 00:14:57.390
that comes from privilege,
because since children of color

00:14:57.390 --> 00:15:01.260
face racism from their earliest
days, the adults in their lives

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:05.250
don't have the choice of whether
to discuss racism with them.

00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:08.280
The subject will come up,
and responsible adults

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:11.310
will also bring it up in
the hopes of improving

00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:13.260
the children's safety.

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:15.660
Parents tell black children,
especially their sons,

00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:18.120
only walk in the street
with one boy at a time,

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:20.250
because if it's three
or more, you're a mob.

00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:21.780
That's how the
police will see you.

00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:23.790
They tell them never to
ask the police for help.

00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:26.004
They say, don't run
or they'll shoot you.

00:15:26.004 --> 00:15:27.420
And if children
of color are going

00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:29.250
to survive in America
and the larger world,

00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:31.800
they'll need to learn
how to respond to racism.

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:34.950
And discussing racism via the
safer realm of children's books

00:15:34.950 --> 00:15:39.390
can prepare them to face it in
the world beyond the classroom.

00:15:39.390 --> 00:15:41.790
Second, teaching
racist children's books

00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:45.000
can help direct the anger
of those readers who

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.040
are racism's targets.

00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:50.370
If, when facing racist art,
children do not learn how

00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:53.010
to express anger or where
to direct their anger,

00:15:53.010 --> 00:15:55.230
they may be left only with
a pain that they cannot

00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:56.464
articulate.

00:15:56.464 --> 00:15:58.380
Finding the appropriate
target for one's anger

00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:00.570
is a vital survival skill.

00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:03.210
As Martha Nussbaum points
out, submerged anger

00:16:03.210 --> 00:16:05.620
can emerge as depression.

00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:09.630
However, expressed anger can
be vital for developing agency.

00:16:09.630 --> 00:16:12.450
As Nico Fridja notes,
"Anger implies hope.

00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:15.890
Further, anger implies that
fighting is meaningful;

00:16:15.890 --> 00:16:18.510
one is not reduced
to mere passivity."

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:20.550
And I'm not arguing
for tough love here.

00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:22.480
Suffering is not ennobling.

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:24.360
I am arguing that
children understand

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:27.030
more than they can articulate
and that without the ability

00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:30.000
to name or diagnose what
they have experienced,

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.810
they risk, in the words
of Mari J. Matsuda,

00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:36.000
"internalizing the injury done
them and being rendered silent

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.640
in the face of
continuing injury."

00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:41.400
And I must again stress here
that racist novels must only

00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:43.080
be read in context.

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:46.830
So to expose the illusion of
kindly white slave-owning Uncle

00:16:46.830 --> 00:16:49.080
Silas and the kind
but gullible Jim

00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:51.030
in "The Adventures
of Huckleberry Finn,"

00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:53.670
readers might turn to realistic
novels like Christopher Paul

00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:57.330
Curtis's "Elijah of Buxton,"
where slavers are murderers

00:16:57.330 --> 00:17:00.120
and torturers, and where
Canada, not America, is

00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:01.560
the land of the free.

00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:04.890
Or they might read "To Be
a Slave," Julius Lester's

00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:07.710
powerful collection of
ex-slaves' narratives, where

00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:09.720
they'll learn of living
quarters, quote, "more

00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:11.910
fit for animals
than human beings,

00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:13.800
mothers who kill
their own children

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:15.700
rather than allow
them to be sold,

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:19.859
and other ways that slaves
resisted their white masters."

00:17:19.859 --> 00:17:21.450
And third, a
critical examination

00:17:21.450 --> 00:17:25.170
of racist children's books
while readers are still children

00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:27.630
may prevent youthful
affection from curdling

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:29.730
into adult nostalgia.

00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:31.435
Grownups' emotional
relationships

00:17:31.435 --> 00:17:32.810
with the works of
their childhood

00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:34.620
often clouds their perception.

00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:37.590
Fondness can deflect
critical questions.

00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:40.170
In contrast, asking children
questions about these books

00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:44.070
while they're children can
create a different, more

00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:47.370
critically engaged, more
uncomfortable relationship,

00:17:47.370 --> 00:17:49.830
because children's emotional
relationships with these books

00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:53.280
are still developing,
still open ended.

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:55.500
The need to read and
to teach these books

00:17:55.500 --> 00:18:01.071
is an argument that I make
with reluctance and sadness.

00:18:01.071 --> 00:18:02.820
All children should
be granted a childhood

00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:04.830
free from the
injuries of prejudice.

00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:08.370
However, since encounters with
hate are sadly inevitable,

00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:10.770
literature can offer us a
safer space for young people

00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:13.950
to explore the complex, the
difficult, the painful emotions

00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:15.540
that racism elicits.

00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:17.790
Both shielding children
from and exposing children

00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:22.680
to racist texts are bad choices,
but failing to confront racism

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:25.050
is far more dangerous
than ignoring it.

00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:27.390
Indeed, learning how
to respond to racism

00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:29.370
is especially
important for children

00:18:29.370 --> 00:18:31.050
in Donald Trump's
America, which has

00:18:31.050 --> 00:18:33.390
made overt racism more
socially acceptable than it

00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:34.890
has been in decades.

00:18:34.890 --> 00:18:37.770
According to the Southern
Poverty Law Center's 2016 study

00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:40.830
"The Trump Effect,"
over 2/3 of educators

00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:43.380
reported that young
people in their schools--

00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:46.297
immigrants, children of
immigrants, Muslims, African

00:18:46.297 --> 00:18:48.330
Americans, and other
students of color--

00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:50.550
had expressed concern
about what might happen

00:18:50.550 --> 00:18:53.520
to them or their families,
and since the election,

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:55.730
hate crimes and racist
harassment in school grounds

00:18:55.730 --> 00:18:57.354
have only increased.

00:18:57.354 --> 00:18:58.770
The Trump candidacy
and presidency

00:18:58.770 --> 00:19:01.440
have required all good
teachers to discuss racism

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:02.910
in the classroom.

00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:04.830
And it may surprise you,
but these discussions

00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:06.900
can also take place where
racism doesn't actually

00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:08.400
seem to be a core
issue of the work,

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:14.730
or where racial politics and
race itself don't seem present.

00:19:14.730 --> 00:19:16.980
However, the stories in
which race seems to disappear

00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:20.040
are often those where racism is
embedded more subtly and more

00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:21.190
dangerously.

00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:23.580
So William Joyce's "The
Fantastic Flying Books

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:27.080
of Mr. Morris Lessmore" is a
case study of this phenomenon.

00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:29.250
It's an Oscar-winning
animated short.

00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:32.440
It became an electronic
book app and a picture book.

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:35.790
And it is an aesthetic marvel.

00:19:35.790 --> 00:19:37.590
It may be the only
children's story

00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:40.740
that I know of that works
equally brilliantly as a book,

00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:43.830
as an app, and as a film.

00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:47.730
It's also really, really white.

00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:51.820
And this is strange,
because Hurricane Katrina,

00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:53.820
a main inspiration
for the story,

00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:57.030
killed nearly 2,000 people,
and most of those people,

00:19:57.030 --> 00:19:59.291
as you probably know,
were African Americans.

00:19:59.291 --> 00:20:01.290
Throughout New Orleans,
African-American victims

00:20:01.290 --> 00:20:03.206
outnumbered white victims
by more than double,

00:20:03.206 --> 00:20:06.630
comprising 66% of
the storm deaths,

00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:09.540
while whites made up only 31%.

00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:11.310
And the storm displaced
many more people.

00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:13.290
But with the exception
of a portrait

00:20:13.290 --> 00:20:15.170
of Duke Ellington
hanging on the wall

00:20:15.170 --> 00:20:19.950
and glimpsed very briefly near
the end of both app and film,

00:20:19.950 --> 00:20:22.770
there are otherwise no
characters of color anywhere

00:20:22.770 --> 00:20:25.530
in the app, in the
film, or the book.

00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:28.010
And the conspicuous racial
absence in this story

00:20:28.010 --> 00:20:29.760
and in Joyce's body
of work more generally

00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:33.750
highlight how structural racism
works in children's literature.

00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:35.760
It tends to normalize
whiteness, tends

00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:38.550
to dwell in nostalgia,
to exoticize,

00:20:38.550 --> 00:20:42.460
to demonize, or just to erase
non-white people altogether.

00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:45.180
Morris Lessmore also represents
technological innovation's

00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:49.170
propensity for distracting us
from the racial assumptions

00:20:49.170 --> 00:20:51.470
that underwrite its success.

00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:54.420
Morris Lessmore's
acclaim depends in part

00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:57.900
upon the way it makes race
disappear beneath whiteness's

00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:00.150
invisibility cloak.

00:21:00.150 --> 00:21:02.550
Unacknowledged
whiteness is the midwife

00:21:02.550 --> 00:21:06.600
to all ostensibly
transcendent timeless stories.

00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:08.130
Culturally unmarked
white characters

00:21:08.130 --> 00:21:10.230
read as universal characters.

00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:13.800
And so in Joyce's work, the
displaced people are all white.

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:16.470
The white title character
becomes caretaker and librarian

00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:19.710
of a beautiful library
whose patrons are all white

00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:21.750
and whose books are
all by white authors.

00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:24.930
So despite Morris Lessmore's
declaration in both app

00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:28.050
and picture book that
everyone's story matters,

00:21:28.050 --> 00:21:31.440
Joyce's own story
emphatically disagrees.

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:34.230
Even more troubling is that
Joyce's larger body of work

00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:37.230
either omits people of
color or includes them only

00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:39.130
as exotic secondary characters.

00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:42.750
So in "Dinosaur Bob and
the Family Lazardo,"

00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:46.050
Jumbu, their bodyguard, said
nothing is a running gag,

00:21:46.050 --> 00:21:47.610
recurring three times.

00:21:47.610 --> 00:21:50.190
Jumbu's only speech
in the book is a smile

00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:52.860
on the final two-page spread.

00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:54.510
His name, his
costume, and his role

00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:57.477
as a servant to a
white American family

00:21:57.477 --> 00:21:58.560
makes him an exotic other.

00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:00.270
And more troubling
is Joyce's tendency

00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:03.810
to shade his villains in dark
colors, such as the attacking

00:22:03.810 --> 00:22:06.690
army of dark elves
in "Santa Calls."

00:22:06.690 --> 00:22:09.700
In images that resemble
1930s magazine illustrations,

00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:12.790
Joyce's imaginative
nostalgic vision

00:22:12.790 --> 00:22:16.050
subtly reinscribes early 20th
century ideologies of race

00:22:16.050 --> 00:22:18.270
while effacing a
history underwritten

00:22:18.270 --> 00:22:20.460
by those same ideologies.

00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:22.470
And having said all
that, I actually

00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:26.010
understand why nostalgia might
inspire "The Fantastic Flying

00:22:26.010 --> 00:22:28.050
Books of Mr. Morris Lessmore."

00:22:28.050 --> 00:22:30.260
After the storm
moved the New Orleans

00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:32.750
that Joyce knew from
contemporary time

00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:34.790
into the receding
tide of memory,

00:22:34.790 --> 00:22:36.860
it's actually not
surprising that longing

00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:40.340
for the pre-Katrina city
would find itself expressed

00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:42.770
in nostalgic reconstruction.

00:22:42.770 --> 00:22:45.470
Located where today dreams
of forgotten yesterdays,

00:22:45.470 --> 00:22:48.200
nostalgia is itself
a crossroads,

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:52.610
with paths leading to childhood,
creativity, and sorrow,

00:22:52.610 --> 00:22:55.400
all of which are central
concerns of Morris

00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:57.310
Lessmore and its creator.

00:22:57.310 --> 00:23:00.530
As Linda Hutcheon suggests, ever
since nostalgia shifted from

00:23:00.530 --> 00:23:03.440
a physical condition-- it
was originally a diagnosis

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:05.300
for severe homesickness--

00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:07.970
to a psychological
one, nostalgia

00:23:07.970 --> 00:23:10.250
has been yoked to childhood.

00:23:10.250 --> 00:23:14.850
In 1798, Immanuel Kant noticed
of nostalgia sufferers,

00:23:14.850 --> 00:23:18.620
Hutcheon tells us, that
people who did return home

00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:20.870
were usually disappointed,
because in fact they

00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:22.815
did not want to
return to a place

00:23:22.815 --> 00:23:25.700
but to a time, a time of youth.

00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:27.440
So that the author
of a children's story

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:31.100
might revive earlier
aesthetic motifs, possibly

00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:33.960
images encountered
in his own childhood,

00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:36.080
not only resonates
with Kant's insight

00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:38.960
but also recalls the
connections between creativity

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:40.640
and nostalgia.

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:43.460
So the problem is actually
not that Joyce is nostalgic.

00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:45.480
The problem, I think, is
his type of nostalgia.

00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:47.120
And to explain what
I mean, I'm going

00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:49.489
to borrow Svetlana Boym's
very useful distinction

00:23:49.489 --> 00:23:51.030
between different
kinds of nostalgia.

00:23:51.030 --> 00:23:54.620
She distinguishes between
restorative nostalgia

00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:56.330
and reflectiveness nostalgia.

00:23:56.330 --> 00:23:58.940
And Joyce's work, I
think, cloaks the former

00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:00.200
in the latter.

00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:02.869
As Boym writes,
"Restorative nostalgia

00:24:02.869 --> 00:24:04.910
does not think of itself
as nostalgia, but rather

00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:07.400
as truth and tradition.

00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:10.700
Reflective nostalgia
dwells on the ambivalences

00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:13.730
of human longing and
belonging and does not

00:24:13.730 --> 00:24:16.880
shy away from the
contradictions of modernity.

00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:20.810
Restorative nostalgia
protects the absolute truth,

00:24:20.810 --> 00:24:24.000
while reflective nostalgia
calls it into doubt."

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.990
And visually, "Morris Lessmore"
does resemble this reflective

00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:29.900
nostalgia, lingering
on, to quote Boym here,

00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:32.440
"ruins, the patina
of time and history,

00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:35.812
and the dreams of another
place, another time."

00:24:35.812 --> 00:24:37.520
However, ideologically,
it seems to yearn

00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:40.700
for that trans-historical
reconstruction characteristic

00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:43.080
of restorative nostalgia.

00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:46.430
It imagines the past where in
the midst of a pastoral idyll,

00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:49.430
a library's open door invites
a white reader onto beautifully

00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:52.760
polished hardwood floors, where
he can peruse stacks of books

00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:56.360
by white authors and loan
some of them to white readers.

00:24:56.360 --> 00:25:00.910
Now to be clear, I don't think
that William Joyce himself

00:25:00.910 --> 00:25:03.590
is consciously nostalgic
for white supremacy.

00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:05.090
I've never met the man.

00:25:05.090 --> 00:25:07.040
Seems like a nice guy.

00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:09.830
Rather, I think that a memory
steeped in a white supremacist

00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:10.380
culture--

00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:12.780
and we live in a white
supremacist culture--

00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:15.650
cannot easily filter
out the racist bits.

00:25:15.650 --> 00:25:18.710
I also think that because
aesthetics are bound up

00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:22.070
in emotions, this type of
restorative nostalgia cannot

00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:26.510
easily be repelled or refuted.

00:25:26.510 --> 00:25:28.730
When the imagination
mingles racist imagery

00:25:28.730 --> 00:25:32.570
or racial erasures with a
deep yearning for childhood,

00:25:32.570 --> 00:25:35.951
these strands become very
difficult to disentangle.

00:25:35.951 --> 00:25:39.020
In other words, the unconscious
racism of restorative nostalgia

00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:41.540
tends to resist analysis.

00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:45.200
Creators and audiences insist
that because they are not

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:47.600
personally racist, their
affection for the work

00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:50.150
repudiates any allegation
that it might contain

00:25:50.150 --> 00:25:52.610
even trace elements of racism.

00:25:52.610 --> 00:25:54.950
The absence of non-white
characters, for example,

00:25:54.950 --> 00:25:57.710
often gets interpreted as
evidence that the artist simply

00:25:57.710 --> 00:26:01.250
does not see race, and thus his
characters' whiteness is really

00:26:01.250 --> 00:26:03.210
a mark of his objectivity.

00:26:03.210 --> 00:26:06.110
But whiteness's power
derives from its ability

00:26:06.110 --> 00:26:08.840
to figure white people
as ideologically

00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:12.590
neutral, as the human
race instead of as white.

00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:15.590
And works that ask us to read
their population of exclusively

00:26:15.590 --> 00:26:19.100
white characters as merely
normal, universal people

00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:21.260
assert white
dominance via not just

00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:26.220
the erasure of non-white people
but the denial of race itself.

00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:28.070
So the absence of
characters of color

00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:30.280
in Joyce's and other
white creators' works--

00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:32.782
and this is a case study here.

00:26:32.782 --> 00:26:33.740
Lots of people do this.

00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:35.660
It's not just William Joyce.

00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:38.150
But this absence of
sympathetic characters of color

00:26:38.150 --> 00:26:41.030
perpetuates failures
of the imagination.

00:26:41.030 --> 00:26:44.930
When children primarily consume
culture that distorts or omits

00:26:44.930 --> 00:26:48.710
people like them, their
psyches become damaged.

00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:51.800
The Nigerian-born contemporary
novelist Chimamanda Ngozi

00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:55.047
Adichie has spoken
eloquently of the effect

00:26:55.047 --> 00:26:56.630
that a childhood
spent reading British

00:26:56.630 --> 00:26:59.272
and American children's
books had on her.

00:26:59.272 --> 00:27:01.730
When she began writing her own
stories at the age of seven,

00:27:01.730 --> 00:27:05.630
she tells us, "All my characters
were white and blue-eyed.

00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:07.130
They played in the snow.

00:27:07.130 --> 00:27:08.270
They ate apples.

00:27:08.270 --> 00:27:11.060
And they talked a lot
about the weather.

00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:13.090
How lovely it was that
the sun had come out.

00:27:13.090 --> 00:27:16.300
Now, this despite the fact
that I lived in Nigeria.

00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:18.320
I'd never been outside Nigeria.

00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:20.240
We didn't have snow.

00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:21.699
We ate mangoes.

00:27:21.699 --> 00:27:23.240
And we didn't talk
about the weather,

00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:25.440
because there was no need to."

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:27.530
And she says her young
experience, quote,

00:27:27.530 --> 00:27:29.580
"shows how impressionable
and vulnerable

00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:33.180
we are in the face of a story,
particularly as children.

00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:37.320
Because all I had read were
books in which the characters

00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:38.820
were foreign, I had
become convinced

00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:40.500
that books, by
their very nature,

00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:42.490
had to have foreigners in them.

00:27:42.490 --> 00:27:45.600
They had to be about things with
which I could not personally

00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:47.100
identify."

00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:50.040
And so, she says, one unintended
consequence was that, quote,

00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:54.070
"I did not know that people like
me could exist in literature."

00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:57.930
And whether we call this process
"the danger of a single story"

00:27:57.930 --> 00:28:00.244
or "colonizing the
imagination," it

00:28:00.244 --> 00:28:02.160
demonstrates that racial
invisibility actually

00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:05.490
is as harmful as
racial stereotyping.

00:28:05.490 --> 00:28:07.320
And such erasures are
not limited to works

00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:09.570
with all-white casts, either.

00:28:09.570 --> 00:28:11.970
Publishers can even perform
racial vanishing acts

00:28:11.970 --> 00:28:14.540
on books featuring
characters of color.

00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:17.010
In the interest of time, I've
cut this whitewashing chapter

00:28:17.010 --> 00:28:19.080
from the presentation
today, but briefly, this

00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:20.340
is what it's about.

00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:23.520
Believing that books with a
person of color on the cover

00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:25.950
will not sell,
publishers will instead

00:28:25.950 --> 00:28:30.870
put a white face or a silhouette
or an ambiguously-raced face

00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:34.830
on the dust jacket of a book
whose protagonist is not white.

00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:36.510
And this is
important, because we

00:28:36.510 --> 00:28:40.710
do judge books by their covers.

00:28:40.710 --> 00:28:43.320
Those that render people
of color invisible

00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:44.876
tell them that
their experiences--

00:28:44.876 --> 00:28:47.250
tell young people of color
that their experiences are not

00:28:47.250 --> 00:28:48.900
important enough to read about.

00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:51.300
And young readers notice.

00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:53.070
So to address the
problem of racism

00:28:53.070 --> 00:28:54.445
in children's
literature, we have

00:28:54.445 --> 00:28:56.730
to change the way
that it is produced.

00:28:56.730 --> 00:28:59.820
Right now, 89% of people
employed in the publishing

00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:02.820
industry identify as
white or Caucasian.

00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:08.310
Only 5% identify as Asian,
3% as Hispanic, and 1%

00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:09.509
as African American.

00:29:09.509 --> 00:29:11.550
And those numbers do not
represent the population

00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:15.870
at large, nor do the books
that are published every year.

00:29:15.870 --> 00:29:20.040
Though half of US school-aged
students are children of color,

00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:23.490
only 14% of American children's
books published in 2015

00:29:23.490 --> 00:29:25.230
were about people
of color, and then

00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:27.360
the number by people
of color was even less.

00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:28.841
It was only 10%.

00:29:28.841 --> 00:29:31.340
And if you look more closely,
you'll notice something else--

00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:34.740
that realism, historical
novels, and nonfiction more

00:29:34.740 --> 00:29:38.670
generally tend to be the most
popular genre categories.

00:29:38.670 --> 00:29:41.190
In American children's and
young adult publishing,

00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:44.070
genre works as a
kind of Jim Crow.

00:29:44.070 --> 00:29:47.160
It's a "non-racial" way
of regulating the literary

00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:49.170
experiences of people of color.

00:29:49.170 --> 00:29:50.700
Where 50 years ago,
people of color

00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:53.280
were almost entirely excluded
from mainstream publishing,

00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:54.990
now they get to
publish, but just

00:29:54.990 --> 00:29:57.900
in a few select neighborhoods,
the borders of which

00:29:57.900 --> 00:30:00.167
can be mapped by genre.

00:30:00.167 --> 00:30:01.500
There are many examples of this.

00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:02.970
Walter Dean Myers
is one example.

00:30:02.970 --> 00:30:04.982
Or as Malinda Lo
has noted, quote,

00:30:04.982 --> 00:30:06.690
"There can be a zillion
white authors who

00:30:06.690 --> 00:30:09.630
write whatever kind of book,
but if one marginalized author

00:30:09.630 --> 00:30:11.580
exists who does
it, that's enough."

00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:13.989
And you don't get
a chance to do it.

00:30:13.989 --> 00:30:15.780
And there are countless
stories like these.

00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:17.370
And until recently,
these are what we've had.

00:30:17.370 --> 00:30:18.370
We've had these stories.

00:30:18.370 --> 00:30:20.070
We haven't really had data.

00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:22.787
But in February of
2015, the University

00:30:22.787 --> 00:30:24.870
of Wisconsin's Cooperative
Children's Book Center,

00:30:24.870 --> 00:30:27.270
which does a fantastic
job of tracking

00:30:27.270 --> 00:30:29.747
how many diverse books
get published every year,

00:30:29.747 --> 00:30:31.830
for the first time posted
a list of all the titles

00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:35.610
in its annual African-American
and American Indian categories

00:30:35.610 --> 00:30:37.030
for the books of that year.

00:30:37.030 --> 00:30:38.970
It didn't list titles in any
other categories and it hasn't

00:30:38.970 --> 00:30:41.178
done this since, but I read
reviews of all the books,

00:30:41.178 --> 00:30:43.920
and in some cases the books
themselves, counted which

00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:45.760
books fit in which genres--

00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:47.760
of course, all books fit
in more than one genre,

00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:49.470
so my percentages
don't add up to 100.

00:30:49.470 --> 00:30:54.570
But these are the patterns of
the 193 books in the African,

00:30:54.570 --> 00:30:56.040
African-American list.

00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:59.580
34% are realism, 30%
have a historical focus,

00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:01.962
and 10% are biographies.

00:31:01.962 --> 00:31:03.420
All the other genres
crowd together

00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:05.680
in a much smaller space.

00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:08.100
Now, the fact that books in
other genres do get published

00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:09.930
may prompt some to
challenge the Jim Crow

00:31:09.930 --> 00:31:11.730
metaphor I'm invoking here.

00:31:11.730 --> 00:31:13.200
I mean, after all,
if segregation

00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:16.860
meant separate water fountains
and bathrooms and schools,

00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:18.600
then wouldn't
publishing's version

00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:21.510
also mean that some areas
would be whites only?

00:31:21.510 --> 00:31:23.290
That's a reasonable question.

00:31:23.290 --> 00:31:24.775
And I think the
reason people ask

00:31:24.775 --> 00:31:27.150
that question is that the term
"segregation" is something

00:31:27.150 --> 00:31:28.640
of a misnomer.

00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:31.200
In the Jim Crow South,
segregation did not literally

00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:33.000
mean the separation of races.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:35.700
It instead was a way of
regulating the spaces

00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:38.010
in which the races interacted.

00:31:38.010 --> 00:31:41.160
So African Americans
shared the same spaces

00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:44.160
with white Americans, but
they shared them unequally.

00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:47.280
As Karen Fields notes,
"Jim Crow on the railways

00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:50.790
offered an exemption for the
Afro-American servant attending

00:31:50.790 --> 00:31:53.670
her mistress or the
mistress's child."

00:31:53.670 --> 00:31:56.610
Comparably, African-American
authors and characters

00:31:56.610 --> 00:32:00.570
do find places in genres
outside of history and realism,

00:32:00.570 --> 00:32:03.390
but only in a
tokenistic way, kind

00:32:03.390 --> 00:32:05.640
of like that servant
on the railway car

00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:10.470
or the sole black
friend on a TV sitcom.

00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:14.430
So in 2014, the presence
of four dystopian novels

00:32:14.430 --> 00:32:15.900
doesn't really
contradict the fact

00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:18.960
that dystopia is mostly
closed to writers

00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:20.670
and characters of color.

00:32:20.670 --> 00:32:22.350
These exceptions not
only prove the rule

00:32:22.350 --> 00:32:25.140
but actually provide a
kind of colorblind alibi

00:32:25.140 --> 00:32:27.300
for structural racism.

00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:29.890
Briefly, four reasons
why diversifying genre

00:32:29.890 --> 00:32:31.540
is really important.

00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:34.240
First, the institutional
emphasis on history

00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:36.520
has the unintended
consequence of implying

00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:43.150
that progress in time correlates
with progress towards justice.

00:32:43.150 --> 00:32:45.970
It subtly conveys the message
that America's crimes happened

00:32:45.970 --> 00:32:48.270
in the past, that the
present is better,

00:32:48.270 --> 00:32:50.260
and the future will
be better still.

00:32:50.260 --> 00:32:53.520
So for example, there are
very few books about Ferguson

00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:55.900
or the Black Lives Matter
movement, the prison

00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:58.730
industrial complex
or racist profiling.

00:32:58.730 --> 00:33:01.570
So part of diversifying genre
requires a richer selection

00:33:01.570 --> 00:33:04.570
of contemporary texts that
address present crises.

00:33:04.570 --> 00:33:06.640
In other words, we
don't need fewer realist

00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:10.297
and historical texts, we
need more of everything else.

00:33:10.297 --> 00:33:12.130
And one reason-- and
this is a second reason

00:33:12.130 --> 00:33:13.980
for why we should
diversify genre--

00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:18.180
is that a different genre offers
a new perspective on the real.

00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:20.620
One risk of so much
historical fiction and realism

00:33:20.620 --> 00:33:22.780
is that readers can
get jaded with yet

00:33:22.780 --> 00:33:25.420
another realistic historical
novel about the Civil Rights

00:33:25.420 --> 00:33:26.590
movement, say.

00:33:26.590 --> 00:33:29.500
But novels can explore
history via any genre--

00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:31.420
via fantasy, via
science fiction,

00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:34.840
dystopia, mystery, horror.

00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:37.570
And speculative fiction's
alternate histories

00:33:37.570 --> 00:33:40.060
illuminate unexamined
facets of our own history.

00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:42.400
An African-American
dystopian novel

00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:44.410
shifts the narrative's
center of gravity,

00:33:44.410 --> 00:33:47.620
examining power from an angle
that a Caucasian dystopian

00:33:47.620 --> 00:33:51.420
novel, which of course is also
known as a dystopian novel,

00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:52.660
might neglect.

00:33:52.660 --> 00:33:54.150
Genre shifts perspective.

00:33:54.150 --> 00:33:56.860
It changes the way we
understand and shakes us out

00:33:56.860 --> 00:33:59.310
of our habits of thought.

00:33:59.310 --> 00:34:02.130
Diversifying genre can
liberate the imagination.

00:34:02.130 --> 00:34:08.580
When we publish, teach, or
read black or other diverse

00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:11.520
dystopian novels, fantasy,
or speculative fiction,

00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:13.350
we challenge the
unspoken assumption

00:34:13.350 --> 00:34:15.810
that certain genres are
mainly for white readers

00:34:15.810 --> 00:34:16.902
and white writers.

00:34:16.902 --> 00:34:19.110
White children should not
be the only ones encouraged

00:34:19.110 --> 00:34:22.260
to see themselves on a
quest in an imaginary world,

00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:24.830
grappling with technologies
of the future--

00:34:24.830 --> 00:34:26.610
maybe some invented here--

00:34:26.610 --> 00:34:30.150
or inhabiting mythological
tales or banding together

00:34:30.150 --> 00:34:33.550
to resist a dystopian regime.

00:34:33.550 --> 00:34:35.429
We need diversity
among genres in order

00:34:35.429 --> 00:34:38.550
to decolonize the imagination.

00:34:38.550 --> 00:34:40.650
And to foster literacy
among all children,

00:34:40.650 --> 00:34:43.170
we need greater diversity
within and among genres,

00:34:43.170 --> 00:34:47.250
because, though a voracious
reader as a child,

00:34:47.250 --> 00:34:49.530
the late Walter Dean
Myers recalled the moment

00:34:49.530 --> 00:34:52.230
as a teen when, noticing that
there was something missing

00:34:52.230 --> 00:34:55.399
in his books, he began to
turn away from reading.

00:34:55.399 --> 00:34:56.940
As he writes, quote,
"As I discovered

00:34:56.940 --> 00:35:00.390
who I was, a black teenager
in a white-dominated world,

00:35:00.390 --> 00:35:04.860
I saw that these characters,
these lives, were not mine."

00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:06.696
Years later, James
Baldwin's "Sonny's Blues"

00:35:06.696 --> 00:35:08.070
would bring Myers
back to reading

00:35:08.070 --> 00:35:11.730
and ultimately lead him to an
acclaimed and prolific career

00:35:11.730 --> 00:35:13.650
of writing books
for young people.

00:35:13.650 --> 00:35:15.540
But Myers was exceptional.

00:35:15.540 --> 00:35:17.333
For many people,
the moment they--

00:35:17.333 --> 00:35:18.850
and I'm quoting Myers here--

00:35:18.850 --> 00:35:21.150
"lost the potential person
they would become"--

00:35:21.150 --> 00:35:23.970
which is such a
powerful and sad idea--

00:35:23.970 --> 00:35:26.160
that moment that they
lost that potential person

00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:28.350
begins a slide towards
hopelessness from which they

00:35:28.350 --> 00:35:30.510
never fully recover.

00:35:30.510 --> 00:35:33.450
Obviously, in the fight
for diverse books,

00:35:33.450 --> 00:35:34.950
focusing on genre
or on really any

00:35:34.950 --> 00:35:36.450
of the areas I've
talked about today

00:35:36.450 --> 00:35:39.090
is insufficient
in and of itself.

00:35:39.090 --> 00:35:41.742
Structural racism is
a many-headed hydra.

00:35:41.742 --> 00:35:43.950
I could have written many
more chapters than the ones

00:35:43.950 --> 00:35:45.510
that I did.

00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:48.120
So in the book's
conclusion, I offer

00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:50.400
a manifesto for anti-racist
children's literature.

00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:52.710
And I'll end with
a few highlights

00:35:52.710 --> 00:35:54.750
from that, and then we
can go to questions,

00:35:54.750 --> 00:35:56.985
or people can
continue their lunch,

00:35:56.985 --> 00:35:58.980
or whatever you'd like to do.

00:35:58.980 --> 00:36:02.190
So first, recognize that
personal racism is unconscious

00:36:02.190 --> 00:36:05.160
and that systemic racism
is typically invisible.

00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:07.410
In 1942, Dr. Seuss
drew a cartoon

00:36:07.410 --> 00:36:09.420
that he called, "What
This Country Needs

00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:11.614
Is a Good Mental Insecticide."

00:36:11.614 --> 00:36:13.530
And the cartoon suggests
that if we could just

00:36:13.530 --> 00:36:17.490
get our heads fumigated, racism
would no longer afflict us.

00:36:17.490 --> 00:36:21.180
While I admire the optimism
of Seuss's metaphor,

00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:23.940
racism is not a
bug, it's a feature.

00:36:23.940 --> 00:36:26.550
Racism is not aberrant,
it's ordinary.

00:36:26.550 --> 00:36:29.130
At the very time that
Seuss drew this cartoon,

00:36:29.130 --> 00:36:31.590
he was creating
other cartoons that

00:36:31.590 --> 00:36:34.290
stereotype people
of Japanese descent,

00:36:34.290 --> 00:36:36.420
inadvertently revealing
his own confusion about how

00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:38.659
racism actually works.

00:36:38.659 --> 00:36:40.200
Racism is what
Raymond Williams would

00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:42.750
have called "a structure
of feeling," which involves

00:36:42.750 --> 00:36:46.230
"meanings and values as they
are actively lived and felt."

00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:48.150
And there's a lived
and felt component

00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:50.940
to racialized thought,
which unconsciously shapes

00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:53.800
our emotional responses, our
daily interactions with others,

00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:56.320
and our general
experience of the world.

00:36:56.320 --> 00:37:00.360
So in any area of life where
emotions inform behavior,

00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:02.880
racial structures of
feeling play a role.

00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:05.190
In children's book
publishing, this

00:37:05.190 --> 00:37:08.270
could be, when evaluating
books for young readers,

00:37:08.270 --> 00:37:10.750
is a character sympathetic
or not sympathetic?

00:37:10.750 --> 00:37:13.800
Is a novel realistic,
or is it not realistic?

00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:17.370
Does the book have
aesthetic merit or not?

00:37:17.370 --> 00:37:21.660
Is the manuscript marketable
or not marketable?

00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:24.210
Second, don't just
teach tolerance.

00:37:24.210 --> 00:37:25.820
Actually respect difference.

00:37:25.820 --> 00:37:27.630
As Karen Fields and
Barbara Fields write,

00:37:27.630 --> 00:37:30.930
the word "tolerance" is
a well-meaning misnomer.

00:37:30.930 --> 00:37:33.000
As they note,
tolerance's shallowness

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.880
as a moral or ethical
precept is plain.

00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:37.950
"Tolerate thy
neighbor as thyself"

00:37:37.950 --> 00:37:40.770
is not quite what Jesus said.

00:37:40.770 --> 00:37:42.540
Instead of tolerating
difference,

00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:44.220
we should instead
respect difference

00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:46.680
by first acknowledging
that it's real.

00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:49.110
And then second, we
should recognize that we

00:37:49.110 --> 00:37:50.750
have difference in common.

00:37:50.750 --> 00:37:52.770
And our differences
are really interesting.

00:37:52.770 --> 00:37:55.080
We can learn from each
other if we listen to

00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:57.930
and respect different
experiences.

00:37:57.930 --> 00:38:01.290
Be aware of the
limits of empathy.

00:38:01.290 --> 00:38:03.360
And this is kind
of a white person

00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:04.830
advice for this particular one.

00:38:04.830 --> 00:38:06.900
White people's
well-meaning attempts

00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:09.780
to feel non-white people's
pain often fall short

00:38:09.780 --> 00:38:12.020
and can actually be harmful.

00:38:12.020 --> 00:38:14.400
So in the field of
children's literature,

00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:16.200
educators like
myself, publishers,

00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:18.570
consumers must do more
than just sympathize

00:38:18.570 --> 00:38:20.280
with under-represented groups.

00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:23.460
All of us should instead ask,
how is my action or inaction

00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:24.660
causing pain?

00:38:24.660 --> 00:38:26.280
How am I responsible?

00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:28.140
What can I do?

00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:29.700
For people who are
teachers, do you

00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:33.000
have just a token Latino or
Latina novel on your syllabus,

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:34.320
or do you have many?

00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:37.440
If you're a publisher, are all
of your black children's books

00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:42.450
realism, historical
fiction, memoir?

00:38:42.450 --> 00:38:44.170
Mark whiteness.

00:38:44.170 --> 00:38:46.230
If, while reading, we
encounter a character

00:38:46.230 --> 00:38:49.500
whose race is not named,
we just assume whiteness.

00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:52.770
But we can take away whiteness's
unmarked power by naming it.

00:38:52.770 --> 00:38:55.890
So for writers who
tend to only assign

00:38:55.890 --> 00:38:58.560
race or ethnicity to
non-white characters,

00:38:58.560 --> 00:38:59.580
you can change that.

00:38:59.580 --> 00:39:02.082
If you identify a Native
American third-grader

00:39:02.082 --> 00:39:03.540
or a black teacher,
you should also

00:39:03.540 --> 00:39:06.310
identify the white football
coach, the white bus driver,

00:39:06.310 --> 00:39:07.800
the white guidance counselor.

00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:09.994
And in the fall of
2015, Kirkus Reviews

00:39:09.994 --> 00:39:11.160
actually started doing this.

00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:13.350
They actually
started identifying

00:39:13.350 --> 00:39:16.067
the race of everybody.

00:39:16.067 --> 00:39:18.150
This is another one
specifically for white people,

00:39:18.150 --> 00:39:20.160
and that is that white
people, all of us

00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:23.310
must recognize our
complicity in white supremacy

00:39:23.310 --> 00:39:25.230
and use our privilege
to fight it.

00:39:25.230 --> 00:39:27.780
To quote Robin DiAngelo
again, "White racism

00:39:27.780 --> 00:39:30.330
is ultimately a white
problem and the burden

00:39:30.330 --> 00:39:33.460
for interrupting it
belongs to white people."

00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:35.340
That's partly why
I wrote this book.

00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:37.770
All white people need to
acknowledge that you do not

00:39:37.770 --> 00:39:41.700
have to actively support white
supremacy in order to benefit

00:39:41.700 --> 00:39:43.080
from white supremacy.

00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:46.260
All white people benefit
from white supremacy,

00:39:46.260 --> 00:39:49.250
whether we want to or not.

00:39:49.250 --> 00:39:53.430
And as beneficiaries, we are
also unwitting accomplices.

00:39:53.430 --> 00:39:56.790
Fortunately, though unfairly,
our unearned privilege

00:39:56.790 --> 00:40:00.270
grants us a more receptive
audience with those whites who

00:40:00.270 --> 00:40:01.860
remain unconvinced.

00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:04.500
So we have a moral obligation
to use white privilege

00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:08.330
to undermine white supremacy.

00:40:08.330 --> 00:40:10.880
Obviously, buy diverse
books, and remember

00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:13.730
children of all races
need diverse books.

00:40:13.730 --> 00:40:15.200
Teach diverse books.

00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:16.617
Publish diverse books.

00:40:16.617 --> 00:40:18.950
Publishers need to meet the
needs of a population that's

00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:20.750
growing more racially
diverse, and not just

00:40:20.750 --> 00:40:22.580
because this is the
right thing to do--

00:40:22.580 --> 00:40:24.980
although it is-- but
because failing to respond

00:40:24.980 --> 00:40:27.770
risks engineering
their own irrelevance.

00:40:27.770 --> 00:40:31.450
By 2043, the US population
will be majority non-white,

00:40:31.450 --> 00:40:35.270
and if deterred by books that
ignore or stereotype them,

00:40:35.270 --> 00:40:37.610
non-white children learn
to read in lesser numbers

00:40:37.610 --> 00:40:40.160
or come to understand that
reading is not for them,

00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:42.860
then they are less likely
to grow into adults who read

00:40:42.860 --> 00:40:44.660
and therefore buy books.

00:40:44.660 --> 00:40:47.000
And finally, it's the
responsibility of everybody--

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:49.670
not just authors, writers,
educators, parents of color,

00:40:49.670 --> 00:40:51.980
but everybody to
support these efforts.

00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:53.540
And we can do this
by being allies,

00:40:53.540 --> 00:40:56.750
by being advocates, by
supporting those working

00:40:56.750 --> 00:40:59.450
to bring diverse books to
children, by buying them

00:40:59.450 --> 00:41:01.520
for our libraries,
teaching them in classes,

00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:04.250
giving them to the young
people in our lives.

00:41:04.250 --> 00:41:07.940
Racism is resilient,
adaptable, and thriving,

00:41:07.940 --> 00:41:10.760
as indicated by the continuing
popularity of white supremacist

00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:11.570
leaders--

00:41:11.570 --> 00:41:13.680
obviously, Donald
Trump here in the US,

00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:17.360
Marine Le Pen in France-- who
did lose the recent election

00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:21.770
but still received 34% of
the vote, or twice what

00:41:21.770 --> 00:41:24.980
her father received
15 years ago.

00:41:24.980 --> 00:41:27.950
The best place to fight racism
is in children's literature

00:41:27.950 --> 00:41:29.660
and children's
culture, and we need

00:41:29.660 --> 00:41:31.850
to help nurture a
new generation that

00:41:31.850 --> 00:41:34.400
is less susceptible to
the follies of bigotry

00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:37.280
and the many wounds it inflicts.

00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:41.480
Thanks for coming out, and I'm
glad to take questions or not

00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:42.229
as you wish.

00:41:42.229 --> 00:41:42.770
So thank you.

00:41:42.770 --> 00:41:45.632
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:54.320
AUDIENCE: I grew up
watching "Looney Tunes"

00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:55.557
on Saturday mornings.

00:41:55.557 --> 00:41:57.890
My dad eventually-- he liked
to do a lot of voice acting

00:41:57.890 --> 00:41:59.350
and stuff--

00:41:59.350 --> 00:42:01.210
eventually we got
the DVDs so that we

00:42:01.210 --> 00:42:02.590
could watch them all the time.

00:42:02.590 --> 00:42:04.090
And I don't know
if you're familiar,

00:42:04.090 --> 00:42:07.510
but Whoopi Goldberg he did a
little disclaimer in front of--

00:42:07.510 --> 00:42:11.530
before the DVDs to say that
this was a different time when

00:42:11.530 --> 00:42:16.690
these cartoons were popular, and
that there was a lot of hidden

00:42:16.690 --> 00:42:17.890
racism in there as well.

00:42:17.890 --> 00:42:19.090
PHILIP NEL: Yeah.

00:42:19.090 --> 00:42:21.930
AUDIENCE: From your
standpoint, is that--

00:42:21.930 --> 00:42:24.920
that disclaimer, is
that on the right track

00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:28.332
to presenting the discussion?

00:42:28.332 --> 00:42:30.040
Because I know a lot
of people were like,

00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:32.740
oh, she didn't need to do that.

00:42:32.740 --> 00:42:34.790
PHILIP NEL: I think she
did need to do that,

00:42:34.790 --> 00:42:37.030
and I think she could
go even further,

00:42:37.030 --> 00:42:40.540
because the racism
of the past continues

00:42:40.540 --> 00:42:41.900
to influence the present.

00:42:41.900 --> 00:42:43.870
So people watching
those cartoons now

00:42:43.870 --> 00:42:45.610
are getting those same messages.

00:42:45.610 --> 00:42:47.860
And then the other reason I
think you could go further

00:42:47.860 --> 00:42:50.800
is that a common
argument that's made

00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:54.035
is, well, people
thought differently

00:42:54.035 --> 00:42:57.580
then than they do now,
and so we can't judge them

00:42:57.580 --> 00:43:01.510
by the same standards that
we judge people now by.

00:43:01.510 --> 00:43:02.980
But here's the thing.

00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:08.380
The range of available
opinions does not change.

00:43:08.380 --> 00:43:11.680
What changes over time is the
distribution of those opinions.

00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:14.140
There were people at the
time those Warner Brothers

00:43:14.140 --> 00:43:17.430
cartoons were made who saw
the stereotypes as bad.

00:43:17.430 --> 00:43:19.870
Now, they weren't creating
the Warner Brothers cartoons.

00:43:19.870 --> 00:43:22.160
But I think the
danger of that is

00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:26.530
it has a tendency to excuse
the racism of the past.

00:43:26.530 --> 00:43:28.550
And not everybody
thought that way.

00:43:28.550 --> 00:43:31.120
I'm going to guess, for
example, that a person who

00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:37.180
saw him or herself
caricatured in 1942 or 1953

00:43:37.180 --> 00:43:40.127
might feel a little differently
than, say, a white creator who

00:43:40.127 --> 00:43:40.960
created that person.

00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:43.000
I'm just going to
hazard a guess.

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:45.370
So I think Whoopi
Goldberg's disclaimer

00:43:45.370 --> 00:43:47.650
is important to include.

00:43:47.650 --> 00:43:48.622
I'd go further.

00:43:48.622 --> 00:43:50.080
I'd go further,
because I think you

00:43:50.080 --> 00:43:52.840
want to keep this art
alive and out there,

00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:56.260
but I also think we need a
complicated relationship to it.

00:43:56.260 --> 00:43:58.730
And I think it's
hard for people to--

00:43:58.730 --> 00:44:01.810
especially for things they saw
as children-- to develop that,

00:44:01.810 --> 00:44:04.040
because you have
affection for it.

00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:05.200
It was fun watching those.

00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:08.020
Mel Blanc was great.

00:44:08.020 --> 00:44:12.970
And culture that is
beautiful, that is enjoyable,

00:44:12.970 --> 00:44:16.110
that is marvelous in many
ways can also be damaging.

00:44:16.110 --> 00:44:18.645
And I think people need
to have those coexisting

00:44:18.645 --> 00:44:19.270
in their minds.

00:44:19.270 --> 00:44:20.920
And I know that's hard.

00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:22.750
And I think I have
maybe exceeded

00:44:22.750 --> 00:44:25.329
the length of my answer
here and gone on too long.

00:44:25.329 --> 00:44:25.870
So I'll stop.

00:44:25.870 --> 00:44:27.830
AUDIENCE: How could
she go further?

00:44:27.830 --> 00:44:30.130
PHILIP NEL: I think
she could go further

00:44:30.130 --> 00:44:34.570
by including some resources on
there beyond the introduction.

00:44:34.570 --> 00:44:36.910
If it's a DVD, that's
an ideal format for,

00:44:36.910 --> 00:44:38.200
let's say, annotating it.

00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:44.369
You could have, just as you do
for films, commentary tracks.

00:44:44.369 --> 00:44:45.910
You could have
commentary tracks that

00:44:45.910 --> 00:44:48.010
work to educate
and not just simply

00:44:48.010 --> 00:44:51.640
say how wonderful this was and
how much I enjoyed writing it.

00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:55.570
The media we have
available today

00:44:55.570 --> 00:44:58.984
offer so many more
possibilities for education.

00:44:58.984 --> 00:45:00.400
So the introduction
could do that.

00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:02.980
It could say, I invite you
to listen to his audio track

00:45:02.980 --> 00:45:06.070
where we talk
about why you might

00:45:06.070 --> 00:45:08.410
want to watch this with
questions and not with simply

00:45:08.410 --> 00:45:09.315
applause.

00:45:09.315 --> 00:45:10.690
But yeah, that's
a great example,

00:45:10.690 --> 00:45:12.150
and I'm glad you raised it.

00:45:12.150 --> 00:45:12.825
So thanks.

00:45:12.825 --> 00:45:14.200
And thanks for
coming, everybody.

00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:15.227
It's very nice of you.

00:45:15.227 --> 00:45:16.060
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:45:16.060 --> 00:45:17.130
AUDIENCE: So it
seems like this is

00:45:17.130 --> 00:45:19.254
sort of an interesting and
provocative question you

00:45:19.254 --> 00:45:21.890
started off with, and I'm
curious how children answer it.

00:45:21.890 --> 00:45:24.280
Is there work-- to some
extent, whether or not

00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:26.640
this is a problem is dependent
on how the children who

00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:27.890
are reading these books react.

00:45:27.890 --> 00:45:28.420
PHILIP NEL: Right.

00:45:28.420 --> 00:45:29.878
AUDIENCE: Is there
work and studies

00:45:29.878 --> 00:45:32.620
you've done about whether
different races identify more

00:45:32.620 --> 00:45:35.530
or less strongly with the Cat
in the Hat, or is this something

00:45:35.530 --> 00:45:38.770
that really we're just looking
back and seeing and analyzing?

00:45:38.770 --> 00:45:39.520
PHILIP NEL: Yeah--

00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:40.570
AUDIENCE: Is that a
thing you can study,

00:45:40.570 --> 00:45:41.445
and have you done so?

00:45:41.445 --> 00:45:44.874
PHILIP NEL: No, I think
that's an excellent question.

00:45:44.874 --> 00:45:47.290
And as you know, the answer
"that's an excellent question"

00:45:47.290 --> 00:45:49.450
is the way of a speaker hedging.

00:45:49.450 --> 00:45:50.780
And so I'm hedging.

00:45:50.780 --> 00:45:53.230
And now I will offer
an imperfect answer

00:45:53.230 --> 00:45:55.450
to your excellent
question, which

00:45:55.450 --> 00:45:59.260
is that that's the central
question of a lot of children's

00:45:59.260 --> 00:46:00.460
literature scholarship.

00:46:00.460 --> 00:46:02.010
What do the children think?

00:46:02.010 --> 00:46:04.700
And it's tricky to answer
for a variety of reasons.

00:46:04.700 --> 00:46:06.040
First of all, you actually
have to do the research

00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:07.750
and go interview
individual children,

00:46:07.750 --> 00:46:09.850
because individual
children are all different

00:46:09.850 --> 00:46:11.814
and all respond
differently, and it's

00:46:11.814 --> 00:46:13.480
impossible to generalize
about children,

00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:15.970
as it is to generalize
about adults.

00:46:15.970 --> 00:46:18.640
And I have not done that
specific research on this.

00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:22.130
I have done the research
on the texts themselves,

00:46:22.130 --> 00:46:24.490
but I haven't done the
research on the children.

00:46:27.140 --> 00:46:28.600
Anecdotally, I can
tell you things,

00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:31.070
of people who, when I've talked
about the Cat in the Hat's

00:46:31.070 --> 00:46:33.680
minstrel ancestry,
have come up and said,

00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:36.580
gosh, he always
disturbed me, and I

00:46:36.580 --> 00:46:39.100
think I can now identify why.

00:46:39.100 --> 00:46:41.920
Even from when I was a child,
this character disturbed me.

00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:43.240
That's anecdotal.

00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:44.314
It's not quantitative.

00:46:44.314 --> 00:46:45.730
I don't think it
would pass muster

00:46:45.730 --> 00:46:49.000
for those of you working in
a major technology company,

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:51.470
I'm just going to guess.

00:46:51.470 --> 00:46:54.545
But that's also part of the
reason for writing the book,

00:46:54.545 --> 00:46:56.920
is that there are a lot of
ways in which these things are

00:46:56.920 --> 00:46:58.450
hidden and unexplored.

00:46:58.450 --> 00:47:00.400
You could write 100
chapters on this.

00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:01.240
I just wrote five.

00:47:01.240 --> 00:47:03.790
But I think a sixth
chapter should

00:47:03.790 --> 00:47:10.666
be some kind of quantitative
study, which I did not do.

00:47:10.666 --> 00:47:12.040
There are other
studies you could

00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:14.500
cite, like on children's
responses to black dolls,

00:47:14.500 --> 00:47:15.070
for example.

00:47:15.070 --> 00:47:21.220
There are famous studies on
those, in which the children,

00:47:21.220 --> 00:47:24.120
even black children prefer the
white doll to the black doll,

00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:26.380
and those stories have
been cited as evidence

00:47:26.380 --> 00:47:29.442
that they learned racism.

00:47:29.442 --> 00:47:31.150
Another way to read
those is that they've

00:47:31.150 --> 00:47:33.766
learned which characters get
to do interesting things,

00:47:33.766 --> 00:47:35.140
and it's not the
black character.

00:47:35.140 --> 00:47:36.440
It's the white character.

00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:39.867
But either way, it's an example
of how those attitudes persist

00:47:39.867 --> 00:47:40.700
in children's minds.

00:47:40.700 --> 00:47:42.490
So there have been studies done.

00:47:42.490 --> 00:47:45.490
I have not done a specific
study on "The Cat in the Hat,"

00:47:45.490 --> 00:47:48.130
but it's a great idea, and
I think it would really--

00:47:48.130 --> 00:47:50.920
we'd learn a lot from
it, and the Seuss people

00:47:50.920 --> 00:47:52.320
would not be happy.

00:47:52.320 --> 00:47:53.230
But good question.

00:47:56.114 --> 00:47:58.030
SPEAKER: Let's give one
more round of applause

00:47:58.030 --> 00:47:58.806
to Dr. Philip Nel.

00:47:58.806 --> 00:47:59.680
Thank you for coming.

00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:03.030
[APPLAUSE]
