KYLE KEANE: So my rant--

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:18.380
not rant.

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:19.920
I keep using the
word rant today.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.820
My pitch about that is that
some people view creativity

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.224
as everything they do
has to be totally unique

00:00:25.224 --> 00:00:27.140
and they need to think
of it all on their own.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.570
Otherwise, it's not that
cool and they shouldn't

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.280
be proud of what they did.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.130
And a lot of creativity
happens by taking something

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.400
that somebody else has done,
following what they've done,

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.440
and then making a
small adjustment,

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.349
and then making another
small adjustment.

00:00:41.349 --> 00:00:42.890
And then suddenly,
you have something

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:44.390
that does something
different, that

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.610
is unique, that
you made yourself.

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.410
And that is creative.

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.350
There's nothing wrong with
taking something, learning

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.930
how somebody else did
it, modifying it to suit

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:54.470
your needs.

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.880
That is part of the
creative process.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.670
And a lot of times,
it's the biggest part

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.490
of the creative process for a
lot of different disciplines.

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:04.050
It's like science
is built on that.

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.190
You have to do a bunch
of stuff, and then

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.140
make a small modification,
because that's

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:10.110
what you're able to do.

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.616
And then you publish that and
somebody else does everything,

00:01:12.616 --> 00:01:13.990
does what you did,
and then makes

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.520
another small modification.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.520
We have a tendency
to hold up heroes,

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.700
like Tesla or Einstein
or great inventors, who

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.700
did these amazing things,
despite no one else

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.470
ever having had that thought.

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.480
And that's just never the case.

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.700
There's always a
history of scientists

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.890
or a history of
artists or history

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.700
of people who laid a foundation
that these people were trained

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.860
and learned how to do
what other people had done

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.080
and then they make
small modifications.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.410
So these first two
days are that process.

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:47.789
We have taken the
Roll-a-Ball ball tutorial

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:50.330
and we've just followed along
and we've talked to our friends

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.830
about it.

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.530
And we asked each other
to do small modifications,

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:55.580
like add new balls.

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:56.670
What does that mean?

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.675
Can you please help
me do this thing?

00:01:58.675 --> 00:02:00.050
And today, we're
going to take it

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:01.258
and we're going to modify it.

00:02:01.258 --> 00:02:03.565
And somebody did a really
cool thing-- or started to--

00:02:03.565 --> 00:02:04.065
yesterday.

00:02:04.065 --> 00:02:07.020
So they tried to take the
ball and turn it into an egg.

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.009
And I think that's
the perfect example

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.670
of taking something that's
built and being like, what can I

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.660
do to tweak this to make it
kind of fun and different?

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.240
And so turning the ball
into an egg is a great one.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.910
When I first did
this, I took the ball

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.830
and I turned it into 25 small
balls that were all talking

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.900
to each other via gravity.

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.810
So instead of just having one
ball roll around the rink,

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.110
I had 25 small balls that were
all attracted to each other

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.025
by gravity, and so
they would roll around

00:02:38.025 --> 00:02:40.650
and when they would hit the wall
they would go [SOUND EFFECT],,

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:41.720
and they would
kind of spread out

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.428
and then come back
together and clump up,

00:02:43.428 --> 00:02:45.590
because they wanted
to be near each other.

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.830
So that's some small
modification of Roll-a-Ball.

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.272
And the reason you do
small modifications

00:02:51.272 --> 00:02:52.730
is to make sure
that you understand

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.970
all the fundamental pieces of
what's happening, because unity

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.920
is this system that has objects
and has a file hierarchy

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.050
and that has the
methods that you put on

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.490
to things, like scripts
that you attach to objects,

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:11.630
and then you can apply coloring
and textures to the objects.

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.640
And there's all these
parts moving around.

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.440
And by making small
modifications,

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.879
you actually understand
if you understand.

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:19.670
If you can't modify
something, then there's

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.450
some fundamental
internal representation

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.950
of what's happening that needs
to be worked out a little bit

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:26.985
more, probably by
talking to some friends

00:03:26.985 --> 00:03:28.985
while you're sitting
inside of a room like this.

00:03:28.985 --> 00:03:31.770
This is a great place to learn.

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:34.370
So that's my pitch as to why we
have structured the first two

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:35.750
days in this way.

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:40.100
And then tomorrow,
you'll be kind of left

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.700
to come up with your own
idea and try to do a two day,

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.410
I've come up with
my own idea and I've

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:48.647
tried to get some people to work
on it with me type of thing.

00:03:48.647 --> 00:03:51.230
And we'll do a small version of
that type of creativity, which

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.704
is I'm drawing inspiration
not from a tutorial,

00:03:54.704 --> 00:03:56.120
but from out in
the world, and I'm

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.578
trying to combine
it with the stuff

00:03:57.578 --> 00:03:59.960
that I learned
from the tutorial.

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:00.950
So there's this whole--

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.719
I kind of sat and thought about
how to structure this thing,

00:04:03.719 --> 00:04:04.760
and I want to share that.

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.800
Because I believe kind
of knowing an approach

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.690
to education often
empowers people

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:11.530
to use it more effectively.
