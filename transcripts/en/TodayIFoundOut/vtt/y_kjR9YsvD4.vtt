00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.440
Falling under the category of “What could
go wrong?” is the sport of ferret legging.

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:19.250
Simple in its design although painful to master,
the sport simply requires a man, a pair of

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.710
baggy trousers and two live ferrets.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.430
The trousers are secured at the ankles, and,
after the ferrets are set free in them, secured

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.270
at the waist as well.

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:35.150
Underwear of any kind is prohibited, and the
animals must be free to roam from leg to leg.

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.899
Neither the contestants nor the animals may
be drugged or drunk.

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:43.050
After the match begins, the contestants stand
in front of the judges and the last man standing

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.340
(they’re pretty much always men) wins.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:50.590
Note that the ferrets must have a full set
of claws and teeth, and neither can be filed

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.590
or blunted in any way.

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.610
Between these, they can wreak a fair amount
of havoc on delicate human flesh, particularly

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.290
once their instincts to bite and dig kick
in.

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:04.570
Plus, as with other carnivores, once the victim
(or rather, contestant) begins bleeding, the

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.630
ferret’s blood lust can trigger attempts
to feed.

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.400
The sport has unknown origins but at the least
was partially popularized by coal miners in

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:18.520
Yorkshire, England in the 1970s, and for several
years the ferret legging record stayed (understandably)

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:19.649
under two minutes.

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:25.590
Then, in 1977, Edward Simpkins is said to
have set a new record in excess of five hours;

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.909
however, for the first four hours he only
had one animal in his pants.

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:33.819
Undoubtedly, the greatest ferret legger of
all time is Reg Mellor, a retired Yorkshire

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:39.259
miner, who set the record at five hours and
26 minutes on July 5, 1981.

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:43.849
Employing ferrets to hunt in the open valleys
around his home for many years, Mellor claimed

00:01:43.849 --> 00:01:47.740
that he had routinely kept the animals in
his trousers to keep them dry and warm when

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:48.740
it rained.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.340
He said part of the secret to his success
was to feed the ferrets well before putting

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.569
them in his pants.

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:58.119
That’s not to say the ferrets didn’t do
their share of damage to him.

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:01.979
After dropping his drawers for a reporter
doing a story on Reg, it was observed that

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.999
his legs were “crosshatched with scars.”

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:09.899
When asked if the ferrets ever bit his more
sensitive bits, Reg replied, “I had ’em

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.130
hangin’ from me tool for hours an’ hours
an’ hours!”

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.610
And that another key to becoming a champion
at this particular sport is to “be able

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.720
to have your tool bitten and not care.”

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.110
Reg’s near three decade run as the record
holder in ferret legging was finally ended

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.670
in May of 2010 by Frank Bartlett of Whittington,
England who set the new record at five hours

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:50.360
and 30 minutes, using the sport as a fundraising
opportunity for his village’s first responders.
