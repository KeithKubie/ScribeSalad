[D. Evans] Now it's time for a quiz to see if you understand how replacement grammars work

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and can follow the BNF grammar we have here.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
The question is, Which of these sentences can be produced from the grammar here

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
starting from the non-terminal sentence?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Check all of the sentences that are in the grammar.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
The choices are Python eat cookies,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.200
Python eat python,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:22.001
and I like eat.
