00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:02.806
- [Instructor] In previous
videos, we've gone into

00:00:02.806 --> 00:00:05.768
reasonable depth on the
narrative of how the Sikh

00:00:05.768 --> 00:00:08.692
religion was started,
initially by Guru Nanak

00:00:08.692 --> 00:00:11.479
and then it how it developed
under the next gurus

00:00:11.479 --> 00:00:13.655
all the way until the
tenth guru and finally

00:00:13.655 --> 00:00:16.963
as it was compiled in
the Guru Granth Sahib,

00:00:16.963 --> 00:00:21.220
which is considered by Sikhs
to be the last and final guru.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.498
Sikhism is oftentimes compared
to both Hinduism and Islam,

00:00:25.498 --> 00:00:28.862
sometimes with reference to
the idea that it has elements

00:00:28.862 --> 00:00:31.207
of both, while others would argue that no,

00:00:31.207 --> 00:00:34.183
it is a completely independent
religion and any similarity

00:00:34.183 --> 00:00:38.756
is just coincidental, so let's
tackle that central question.

00:00:38.756 --> 00:00:42.870
What elements of continuity
does Sikhism represent?

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.776
And in this video, we're
gonna think about continuity

00:00:45.776 --> 00:00:49.477
in terms of religious
continuity and in particular,

00:00:49.477 --> 00:00:53.791
does it have elements from
Islam or Hinduism in it?

00:00:53.791 --> 00:00:56.764
So we could first focus on
some of the cultural trappings

00:00:56.764 --> 00:00:59.449
or some of the historical
trappings of Sikhism

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:03.376
and think about the connections
to both Hinduism and Islam.

00:01:03.376 --> 00:01:06.906
The first obvious connections
is that Guru Nanak,

00:01:06.906 --> 00:01:09.401
the first guru, and
many of the early gurus

00:01:09.401 --> 00:01:11.568
grew up in Hindu families.

00:01:14.564 --> 00:01:17.357
But there are also cultural
connections to Islam.

00:01:17.357 --> 00:01:22.180
The Sikh religion emerges in
Punjab, which is where or near

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.027
the various Muslim rulers of
the time held their capitals,

00:01:26.027 --> 00:01:27.798
whether we're talking
about the Delhi sultanate,

00:01:27.798 --> 00:01:31.329
which was in power for over
250 years when Sikhism started

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:34.935
to emerge with Guru Nanak,
but also the Moghul empire,

00:01:34.935 --> 00:01:38.215
which really developed in its
early stages at the same time

00:01:38.215 --> 00:01:40.605
that Sikhism develops, so
that many of the followers

00:01:40.605 --> 00:01:43.772
of Sikhism were both Hindu and Muslim.

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:49.305
A lot of the terminology
of Sikhism borrows words

00:01:49.305 --> 00:01:53.133
and borrows ideas from
both Islam and Hinduism.

00:01:53.133 --> 00:01:57.168
The word Allah is used
to refer to god in parts

00:01:57.168 --> 00:02:01.478
of the Guru Granth Sahib
but so is the word Ram.

00:02:01.478 --> 00:02:04.916
One of the first and closest
followers of Guru Nanak,

00:02:04.916 --> 00:02:08.641
who was with him most of
his life was Bhai Mardana

00:02:08.641 --> 00:02:12.271
and even today, many
pictures of Guru Nanak

00:02:12.271 --> 00:02:15.143
would have Bhai Mardana in them.

00:02:15.143 --> 00:02:17.833
Guru Nanak famously as
someone who was spiritually

00:02:17.833 --> 00:02:20.306
precocious and spiritually curious,

00:02:20.306 --> 00:02:23.478
traveled through India and
Persia and the Middle East

00:02:23.478 --> 00:02:28.045
so he visited many temples
but there's also many historic

00:02:28.045 --> 00:02:32.428
accounts of him going to
Mecca and performing hajj.

00:02:32.428 --> 00:02:35.155
The Guru Granth Sahib, which
is considered the spiritual

00:02:35.155 --> 00:02:38.499
book the 11th and final
guru for the Sikhs,

00:02:38.499 --> 00:02:41.183
of the contributors to
them, you have Kabir,

00:02:41.183 --> 00:02:44.883
who grew up in a Muslim
family, he lived either around

00:02:44.883 --> 00:02:48.391
the time of Guru Nanak or in
the century before Guru Nanak

00:02:48.391 --> 00:02:50.847
and would write about both Allah and Ram,

00:02:50.847 --> 00:02:53.745
although he was often critical
of both Hinduism and Islam,

00:02:53.745 --> 00:02:58.480
and you also have Shaikh Farid,
who was a Muslim Sufi writer

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.545
and spiritual figure and
he has also contributed

00:03:01.545 --> 00:03:03.405
to the Guru Granth Sahib.

00:03:03.405 --> 00:03:06.389
There's also important rituals
that come from Hinduism,

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:10.512
so for example, when Sikhs
pass away, like Hindus,

00:03:10.512 --> 00:03:13.742
they are cremated, so
just looking at this list,

00:03:13.742 --> 00:03:16.448
you immediately see that
there's definitely cultural

00:03:16.448 --> 00:03:18.267
elements whether we're
talking about words,

00:03:18.267 --> 00:03:19.841
whether we're talking about rituals,

00:03:19.841 --> 00:03:21.515
whether we're talking about
even just the historical

00:03:21.515 --> 00:03:23.690
narrative of how and where Sikhism started

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.550
that are closely tied to ideas of Hinduism

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.671
and closely tied to ideas of Islam.

00:03:29.671 --> 00:03:32.059
But now let's look at the
scripture itself and see if

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:36.238
we can glean any more
similarities or differences.

00:03:36.238 --> 00:03:40.893
This is the Mool Mantar
which means main mantra

00:03:40.893 --> 00:03:43.976
or the basic teaching of
Sikhism and it comes from

00:03:43.976 --> 00:03:46.522
Guru Nanak and this is
an English translation,

00:03:46.522 --> 00:03:49.376
you'll see variations of
this but it essentially says

00:03:49.376 --> 00:03:53.126
one universal creator
god, the name is truth,

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.094
creative being personified,
no fear, no hatred,

00:03:59.094 --> 00:04:03.623
image of the undying,
beyond birth, self-existent,

00:04:03.623 --> 00:04:05.708
by guru's grace.

00:04:05.708 --> 00:04:07.950
Throughout the Guru Granth
Sahib and much of the writings

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:12.237
of especially Guru Nanak
focus on devotion to god,

00:04:12.237 --> 00:04:15.019
the one universal god, and
so many of you might think,

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:17.209
well that seems to have
connections to Islam

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:19.164
but then you could say,
well even in Hinduism,

00:04:19.164 --> 00:04:22.267
although there are many aspects
of god, the various deities,

00:04:22.267 --> 00:04:25.909
but there's this notion of a
fundamental reality of Brahman

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:28.201
so maybe it has elements of
that or maybe this is just

00:04:28.201 --> 00:04:30.706
independently developed but
there definitely are parts

00:04:30.706 --> 00:04:34.303
of the Guru Granth Sahib
which seem to have elements

00:04:34.303 --> 00:04:36.667
that are close to Islam.

00:04:36.667 --> 00:04:38.658
This is a quote from Guru Nanak.

00:04:38.658 --> 00:04:41.600
He is Allah, the unknowable,
the inaccessible,

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.874
all-powerful and merciful creator.

00:04:43.874 --> 00:04:47.991
So one argument is he's using
the Arabic word for god,

00:04:47.991 --> 00:04:49.254
he's using Allah.

00:04:49.254 --> 00:04:51.445
Now another argument,
counterargument, would be well,

00:04:51.445 --> 00:04:53.961
he's just using the language
that his followers knew

00:04:53.961 --> 00:04:56.555
and many of his followers
were Muslim and so would have

00:04:56.555 --> 00:04:59.651
used the word Allah for
god, but he is not saying

00:04:59.651 --> 00:05:02.018
that it necessarily has to be the exact

00:05:02.018 --> 00:05:05.065
concept of god as in Islam.

00:05:05.065 --> 00:05:07.113
Now this is from Kabir.

00:05:07.113 --> 00:05:10.395
Someone sets up a stone idol
and all the world worships it

00:05:10.395 --> 00:05:13.483
as the lord, those who hold to this belief

00:05:13.483 --> 00:05:15.909
will be drowned in the river of darkness,

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:17.784
and this is in the Guru Granth Sahib.

00:05:17.784 --> 00:05:20.281
This notion of being against idol worship

00:05:20.281 --> 00:05:22.881
comes out very clear in this
quotation and that is another

00:05:22.881 --> 00:05:26.843
idea that is often associated with Islam.

00:05:26.843 --> 00:05:27.767
But as I mentioned,

00:05:27.767 --> 00:05:30.444
there's also many parallels with Hinduism.

00:05:30.444 --> 00:05:32.637
In the first video on
Sikhism, I gave you this quote

00:05:32.637 --> 00:05:36.225
from Guru Nanak, the world is
a drama, staged in a dream.

00:05:36.225 --> 00:05:39.250
Which alludes to the Hindu notion of maya,

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.641
the physical reality is all an illusion,

00:05:41.641 --> 00:05:44.403
we wanna pierce through that veil.

00:05:44.403 --> 00:05:46.770
What should the yogi have to fear?

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:50.584
Trees, plants, and all
that is inside and outside

00:05:50.584 --> 00:05:51.751
is he himself.

00:05:53.398 --> 00:05:55.544
So this is an idea that
we get very clearly

00:05:55.544 --> 00:05:58.738
from the Upanishads,
any notion of duality,

00:05:58.738 --> 00:06:02.508
of me being different from
you or even one versus god,

00:06:02.508 --> 00:06:05.805
it's all an illusion, all is one.

00:06:05.805 --> 00:06:10.202
By the karma of past actions,
the robe of this physical body

00:06:10.202 --> 00:06:14.369
is obtained, by his grace the
gate of liberation is found.

00:06:15.965 --> 00:06:19.560
So clear references to the
Hindu notions of karma,

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:23.230
that action drives
consequences, that you enter one

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:26.735
physical body after another,
but that's not your true self,

00:06:26.735 --> 00:06:29.865
the robe of this physical,
there's a true self

00:06:29.865 --> 00:06:34.194
and eventually, through the
grace of the ultimate reality,

00:06:34.194 --> 00:06:38.078
you might be able to have
liberation, have moksha,

00:06:38.078 --> 00:06:40.758
so clear Hindu parallels as well.

00:06:40.758 --> 00:06:44.073
One angle is that Guru Nanak
and Sikhism was attempting

00:06:44.073 --> 00:06:47.862
a reformation of both, taking
elements that were compelling

00:06:47.862 --> 00:06:50.882
in either and then purifying
them, making them more

00:06:50.882 --> 00:06:54.160
internal focused, less focused on ritual,

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:57.691
less focused on the external,
and more focused on meditation

00:06:57.691 --> 00:06:59.022
and the true self.

00:06:59.022 --> 00:07:01.766
There's a lot of quotations
in reference to both religions

00:07:01.766 --> 00:07:04.738
that make it clear that
it was something different

00:07:04.738 --> 00:07:08.439
and is critical of at least
how both religions seemed

00:07:08.439 --> 00:07:11.606
to be practiced in India at that time.

00:07:12.642 --> 00:07:15.604
Guru Nanak famously
said there is no Hindu,

00:07:15.604 --> 00:07:17.984
there is no Musalman.

00:07:17.984 --> 00:07:20.170
Most people feel that he's
saying this distinction

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:22.427
that we make between human
beings based on these

00:07:22.427 --> 00:07:24.751
belief systems, that
these are superficial,

00:07:24.751 --> 00:07:27.448
that these are to some degree transient,

00:07:27.448 --> 00:07:29.568
that we are all part of the universal,

00:07:29.568 --> 00:07:32.649
part of the ultimate reality, part of god.

00:07:32.649 --> 00:07:35.574
This is from Guru Arjan,
the Muslim god Allah

00:07:35.574 --> 00:07:40.113
and the Hindu god Paarbrahm
are one and the same.

00:07:40.113 --> 00:07:43.016
So here, trying to unify
these ideas, and listen,

00:07:43.016 --> 00:07:45.696
this is in a context where many
of the followers are Muslim

00:07:45.696 --> 00:07:47.979
and many are Hindu and putting it in words

00:07:47.979 --> 00:07:49.862
that they understand.

00:07:49.862 --> 00:07:52.700
My body and breath of
life belong to Allah,

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:55.529
to Ram, the god of both.

00:07:55.529 --> 00:07:58.691
So once again it's this
bhakti, this devotional aspect,

00:07:58.691 --> 00:08:02.192
surrendering to god and using
the terminology that would be

00:08:02.192 --> 00:08:06.359
familiar to people in that
time and in that space.

00:08:07.252 --> 00:08:09.335
So I encourage you, go
out there, research,

00:08:09.335 --> 00:08:12.161
think about it for yourself,
Sikhism for sure has its own

00:08:12.161 --> 00:08:15.597
unique identity and
pretty much every religion

00:08:15.597 --> 00:08:18.504
is a product of the
context in which it emerged

00:08:18.504 --> 00:08:20.559
and has elements from other religions,

00:08:20.559 --> 00:08:22.449
whether or not that
was done intentionally,

00:08:22.449 --> 00:08:25.791
whether or not it's chance,
there does seem to be parallels.

00:08:25.791 --> 00:08:28.785
We can make a whole tree
of religions if we like,

00:08:28.785 --> 00:08:33.108
if we put Sikhism right here,
the question mark of this

00:08:33.108 --> 00:08:37.059
video is you have this narrative of Islam,

00:08:37.059 --> 00:08:40.196
to what degree does it influence Sikhism?

00:08:40.196 --> 00:08:43.632
And many would say that especially
the Sufi orders of Islam

00:08:43.632 --> 00:08:45.756
have much to do with Sikhism.

00:08:45.756 --> 00:08:49.702
Sufism is a school of Islam
that is more inward looking,

00:08:49.702 --> 00:08:52.201
that is about devotional love to god

00:08:52.201 --> 00:08:54.987
and that's what a lot of
Sikhism is focused on,

00:08:54.987 --> 00:08:58.002
but as mentioned, one could
also think about Hinduism,

00:08:58.002 --> 00:09:00.698
which is much older than
pretty much any other living

00:09:00.698 --> 00:09:03.825
religion today and in other videos,

00:09:03.825 --> 00:09:06.983
we talk about the bhakti movement,
which is about devotional

00:09:06.983 --> 00:09:10.697
love to god, there's also a
school of thought in Hinduism

00:09:10.697 --> 00:09:13.674
known as Vedanta, which is
more focused on the core

00:09:13.674 --> 00:09:16.037
spiritual ideas of the Upanishads,

00:09:16.037 --> 00:09:19.406
the notion of the ultimate
self, the ultimate reality,

00:09:19.406 --> 00:09:21.979
escaping from the cycle
of births and deaths,

00:09:21.979 --> 00:09:24.853
from samsara, achieving
liberation, moksha.

00:09:24.853 --> 00:09:27.702
All of these ideas are in Sikhism

00:09:27.702 --> 00:09:29.651
and to make the point clear
that all of our major religions

00:09:29.651 --> 00:09:34.232
are connected to each other,
we can keep drawing this tree.

00:09:34.232 --> 00:09:38.130
We talk about how Buddhism
springs out of Hinduism,

00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:40.843
that Buddha was a Hindu and
it might have been in reaction

00:09:40.843 --> 00:09:44.123
to some of the ritual and
the caste that Buddha saw

00:09:44.123 --> 00:09:46.396
in Hinduism or at least in Hindu culture.

00:09:46.396 --> 00:09:47.683
In fact, some of those same motivations

00:09:47.683 --> 00:09:49.974
might have motivated Guru Nanak.

00:09:49.974 --> 00:09:51.953
Islam, we talk about in other videos,

00:09:51.953 --> 00:09:56.120
famously emerges from a
Judeo-Christian tradition.

00:09:57.162 --> 00:10:00.360
The most important prophets
in Islam after Mohammed

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:04.465
are Jesus, Moses, and Abraham
and Christianity of course

00:10:04.465 --> 00:10:08.632
comes out of a Jewish
tradition, Jesus was Jewish.

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:12.438
And one could say that there's
even some direct connections

00:10:12.438 --> 00:10:16.843
between Judaism and Islam,
notions of not eating pork,

00:10:16.843 --> 00:10:21.318
notions of halal and kosher,
ideas of circumcision.

00:10:21.318 --> 00:10:24.102
And one could even argue
that Judaism and Islam

00:10:24.102 --> 00:10:27.352
also have close ties to Zoroastrianism,

00:10:28.276 --> 00:10:31.855
a very ancient monotheistic
religion and Cyrus the Great

00:10:31.855 --> 00:10:35.382
of Persia was the one who
really spread Zoroastrianism

00:10:35.382 --> 00:10:39.107
and he is considered a messiah
amongst the Jewish people

00:10:39.107 --> 00:10:41.990
because he liberated them
from the Babylonian captivity,

00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:44.112
helped them re-settle in Jerusalem,

00:10:44.112 --> 00:10:47.434
and helped rebuild the
temple at Jerusalem.

00:10:47.434 --> 00:10:50.340
Zoroastrianism also has ties to Islam.

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:54.323
Zoroastrians pray five times
a day just like Muslims,

00:10:54.323 --> 00:10:56.667
they have the ritual
bathing before the prayer,

00:10:56.667 --> 00:10:59.439
just like Muslims, at
the same time of day.

00:10:59.439 --> 00:11:01.809
So once again, amongst
all of these religions,

00:11:01.809 --> 00:11:04.161
they definitely came in
contact with each other

00:11:04.161 --> 00:11:06.836
and you definitely have
ideas that are shared

00:11:06.836 --> 00:11:09.338
amongst the religions, so with that,

00:11:09.338 --> 00:11:12.877
I'll leave you with one
last quote from Guru Nanak.

00:11:12.877 --> 00:11:16.064
And this one would arguable
be addressed to his Muslim

00:11:16.064 --> 00:11:19.127
followers but it gives
you a sense of his trying

00:11:19.127 --> 00:11:21.140
to bring people back to the internal,

00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:24.232
trying to make people less
focused on external ritual,

00:11:24.232 --> 00:11:28.704
external physical reality,
and more on internal goodness

00:11:28.704 --> 00:11:31.101
and your actions being more important

00:11:31.101 --> 00:11:33.935
than your words or your rituals.

00:11:33.935 --> 00:11:37.825
"Make kindness your mosque,
sincerity your prayer carpet,

00:11:37.825 --> 00:11:40.620
"what is just and lawful your Quran,

00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:44.761
"modesty your circumcision,
civility your fasting,

00:11:44.761 --> 00:11:48.760
"so shalt thou be a
Musalman," or a Muslim.

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:51.846
"Make right conduct your
Kaaba," making reference

00:11:51.846 --> 00:11:55.875
to the pilgrimage site Muslims
go to and pray towards,

00:11:55.875 --> 00:11:58.888
"truth your spiritual
guide, good works your creed

00:11:58.888 --> 00:12:01.870
"and your prayer, the
will of god your rosary,

00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:05.787
"and god will preserve
your honor," Guru Nanak.
