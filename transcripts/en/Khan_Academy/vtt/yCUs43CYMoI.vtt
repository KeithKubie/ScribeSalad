00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.250
the 5th century in Greece started off

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.110
with the persian invasion and ended with

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.299
the Peloponnesian War and now we're

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:08.460
entering into the 4th century in Greece

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.340
and as we entered to the 4th century

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.610
Thebes is the dominant city-state but as

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.100
we get into the mid 4th century and

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.140
especially the end of it we will see

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.869
that all of Greece gets dominated and

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.630
then unified by the Makedonians or

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.180
the Macedonians and in particular the

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.529
first unifier here was Philip of Macedon

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.230
and this is a bust of him and he's known

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.420
as he comes to power in 359 BCE he comes

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.239
to power his father was king of Macedon

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.809
but then his older brothers died he

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.210
becomes it's actually his nephew who is

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.640
heir to the throne he becomes regent for

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.190
his for his infant nephew which means he

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.320
has the power temporarily but then he

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.420
actually takes full control and becomes

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.149
king of Macedon or makaton as it's often

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.250
pronounced in 359 BCE and what he then

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.210
goes off about doing is taking over most

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.330
of the Greek city-states and eventually

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.820
he's able to unify most of the Greek

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.189
city-states and you can see on this map

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.670
here which i got from wikipedia this is

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.710
a little bit of information about the

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.100
map you can see how he expanded his

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.659
empire over time that remember 359 BCE

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.159
he becomes king of Macedon in 352 he's

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.210
moving into he's moving into Cecily then

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.119
in the end the three forties he's going

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.200
into the race so he's going into

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.140
Thrace and Molossia and Molossia is

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.299
interesting, the king of Molossia he

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.430
actually ends up mattering his he ends up

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.460
marrying the king of Molossia's daughter

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.369
Olympias who ends up being alexander the

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.469
great mother and she's a pretty

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:02.969
interesting characters we will see a

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.890
little bit she was part of this cult

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.200
that worships snakes is believed that

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.200
she slept with snakes

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.830
but he goes off and continues to conquer

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.400
eventually he's able to subjugate most

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.830
of the city-state's of Greece except for

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.120
Sparta and that takes us that takes us

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.530
2 337 right over here where he is able

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.019
to establish the League of Corinth it

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:31.819
was only called the League of Corinth after

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:34.190
the fact but he gets the leaders of the

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.040
significant city-state together in corn

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.480
that's why it's called the League of

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.459
corn and they swear their oath

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.790
essentially to Philip king of Macedon

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.610
who they call the hegemon and what's

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.319
really important about that is he is

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:51.349
able to unify the Greek city-state

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:55.819
outside of Sparta and in doing so he

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:58.910
sets things up for his son the famous

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.980
alexander the great the Great to

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.049
continue to unify Greece alexander the

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:05.360
great's actually able to subjugates part

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.390
up but then more famously he goes off to

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.090
conquer the entire persian empire and

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.459
then beyond in his short life and will

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:16.280
have at least another video on that but

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.280
just to get a feel for what happened at

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.480
the League of Corinth in 337 BCE i will

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.880
share this this oath that the various

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.060
city states had to commit to and it says

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.840
I swear by Zeus gay Helios Poseidon and

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.420
all the gods and goddesses I will abide

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.910
by the common piece and i will neither

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.370
break the agreement with Philip nor take

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.220
up arms on land or sea harming any of

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.250
those abiding by the oats nor shall I

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.160
take any city or fortress nor harbour by

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.829
craft or contrivance with intent of war

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:57.470
against the participants of the war nor

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.930
shall I depose the kingship of Philip or

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.239
his descendants nor the Constitution's

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:04.340
existing in each state when they swore

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.799
the oath of the peace nor shall i do

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:08.450
anything contrary to these agreements

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.669
nor shall allow anyone else as far as

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:13.250
possible but if anyone does commit any

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.260
breach of the Treaty I shall go and

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.930
support as called by those who need and

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:19.820
I shall fight the transgressors of the

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.820
common piece as decided by as

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.430
decided by the council and called on by

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.910
the hegemon who is that when this when

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:31.490
the oath is made who is Philip of

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:35.720
Macedonia now unfortunately for Philip

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.330
this happens in 337 where for the most

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.330
part he's the first to unify the Greek

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.480
city-states outside of Sparta but he's

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.190
only able to live about a year after

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:46.910
that

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:52.160
a year later we're now in 336 BCE and

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.040
he's in the old capitol of the mat

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.590
kalonian kingdom which is very close to

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:00.920
Pella celebrating the wedding of his

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:05.120
daughter to his to his brother-in-law so

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.850
his daughter who is who is Alexander's

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:10.880
sister she's being married to Olympias'

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.370
brother so he's marrying his

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:16.460
daughter to her uncle and it is during

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:20.030
that wedding that Philip of Macedon is

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:22.910
killed by pase Gnaeus who is his

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:25.160
bodyguard and there's a lot of really

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.840
interesting stories he's killed at the

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:30.530
wedding in 336 BCE and there's a lot of

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:32.030
really interesting stories about what

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:33.710
the motivation for Policy Gnaeus was

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:36.140
there are many accounts that say that

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:39.050
Posse Gnaeus was Phillips lover he was

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:41.180
on some level jealous and he was on some

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:44.510
level because another relative of Philip

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:46.730
fronted Palestinians and Phillip didn't

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:47.810
go to defend him

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:49.670
there's some narratives that this was

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:53.780
arranged somehow by Olympias, Phillips's

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:57.740
wife and the mother of Alexander to put

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:59.630
Alexander on the throne there are some

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:02.600
motivation there because also a shortly

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:04.610
before the assassination he took a

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:07.220
second wife which was his more favored

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:09.440
wife as opposed to Olympias so there's a

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.360
lot of really interesting account and i

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.490
encourage you to read up on it but the

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:16.730
interesting thing is is after he gets

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:18.260
assassinated

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.110
well then there's a bit of a a scrabble

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:23.570
scramble for power but it leaves

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:27.020
Alexander the Great or eventually is the

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:28.970
Alexander the third officially but

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:30.800
eventually Alexander the Great

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.410
becomes becomes the hegemon and he's

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:35.120
eventually in his short life he's only

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:36.560
20 years old

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:39.680
when he becomes king he is able to as

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.900
we'll see in the next few videos take

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:44.389
over all of the Persian Empire and

00:06:44.389 --> 00:06:46.490
beyond and subjugates party so he

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:49.310
further unifies the Greeks and takes on

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:55.870
the mighty Persian Empire
