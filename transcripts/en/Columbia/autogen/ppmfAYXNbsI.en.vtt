00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.980
setup three specific points first is
that the activism we see is really

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:46.990
that the activism we see is really
 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:49.590

Delaware model that puts the board at
 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.170
Delaware model that puts the board at
the center of governance so I think

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.180
the center of governance so I think
 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.530
the center of governance so I think

that what the new form of the activism

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460
that what the new form of the activism
 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.989
that what the new form of the activism
shows us is that the board needs to

00:01:27.989 --> 00:01:27.999
shows us is that the board needs to
 

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:31.889
shows us is that the board needs to
evolve and that that's a good thing the

00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:31.899
evolve and that that's a good thing the
 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:34.050
evolve and that that's a good thing the
current model of the board which

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060
current model of the board which
 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.200
current model of the board which
consists really of outside directors who

think what the present wave shows us is
 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.979
think what the present wave shows us is
that a rethink is in what is in order

the two and so the right response is not

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330
the two and so the right response is not
 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.550
the two and so the right response is not
to bemoan this change but rather

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560
to bemoan this change but rather
 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.050
to bemoan this change but rather
governance innovation which brings us

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060
governance innovation which brings us
 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.270
governance innovation which brings us
back to the board as well as

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280
back to the board as well as
 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.820
back to the board as well as
appreciation that the governance needs

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830
appreciation that the governance needs
 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:16.500
appreciation that the governance needs
of the firm will vary in the cross

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510
of the firm will vary in the cross
 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.479
of the firm will vary in the cross
section so that we should expect

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489
section so that we should expect
 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:21.690
section so that we should expect
differences across firms and differences

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700
differences across firms and differences
 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.860
differences across firms and differences
over time so we need to think about how

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870
over time so we need to think about how
 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.229
over time so we need to think about how
to avoid the lock-in of a governance

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239
to avoid the lock-in of a governance
 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:30.750
to avoid the lock-in of a governance
structure that might be exactly the

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760
structure that might be exactly the
 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.780
structure that might be exactly the
right one for this moment but not a good

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790
right one for this moment but not a good
 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.890
right one for this moment but not a good
at ation for a later moment so I want to

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900
at ation for a later moment so I want to
 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.979
at ation for a later moment so I want to
come back to point to which is the

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:40.989
come back to point to which is the
 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:43.020
come back to point to which is the
nature of the monitoring board and the

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030
nature of the monitoring board and the
 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:48.090
nature of the monitoring board and the
limitations of it so the issue with the

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100
limitations of it so the issue with the
 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.910
limitations of it so the issue with the
monitoring board is that the directors

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920
monitoring board is that the directors
 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.690
monitoring board is that the directors
the new directors were outsiders from an

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700
the new directors were outsiders from an
 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.270
the new directors were outsiders from an
information point of view how could they

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280
information point of view how could they
 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.360
information point of view how could they
monitor the management team without deep

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370
monitor the management team without deep
 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.229
monitor the management team without deep
knowledge of the firm and the business

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239
knowledge of the firm and the business
 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:07.050
knowledge of the firm and the business
environment in which it's at the stock

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060
environment in which it's at the stock
 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.360
environment in which it's at the stock
market actually provided the answer

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370
market actually provided the answer
 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.580
market actually provided the answer
through the production of informative

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590
through the production of informative
 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.330
through the production of informative
stock prices that would impound the

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340
stock prices that would impound the
 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.729
stock prices that would impound the
available information about the firm as

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739
available information about the firm as
 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:21.000
available information about the firm as

disclosure regime
 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.640
disclosure regime
and so the stock price is based on that

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650
and so the stock price is based on that
 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:32.640
and so the stock price is based on that
could overcome significantly overcome

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650
could overcome significantly overcome
 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:35.939
could overcome significantly overcome
the information gap that the directors

00:04:35.939 --> 00:04:35.949
the information gap that the directors
 

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:38.100
the information gap that the directors
had because they provided a basis for a

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110
had because they provided a basis for a
 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.290
had because they provided a basis for a
year against year performance comparison

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300
year against year performance comparison
 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.900
year against year performance comparison
and comparison against firms in the same

and comparison against firms in the same

compensation to stock prices and and

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:52.419
compensation to stock prices and and
 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:54.960
compensation to stock prices and and
this was the way we would monitor the

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970
this was the way we would monitor the
 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:57.779
this was the way we would monitor the
managerial team but notice of course the

00:04:57.779 --> 00:04:57.789
managerial team but notice of course the
 

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:01.320
managerial team but notice of course the
stock prices aren't limited not only the
