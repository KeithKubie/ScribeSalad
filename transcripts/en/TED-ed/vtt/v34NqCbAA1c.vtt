00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.776
There's a myth
that grandmasters can see ten,

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.680
fifteen, twenty moves ahead.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.856
And it's a great myth
because I'm a grandmaster

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.560
and it makes me look
like a super freaking genius.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.216
But the truth is,

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.836
in just the first four moves,

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.224
there are 318 billion ways you could play.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.856
Now, that would be cool
if I could pull that off,

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.680
but grandmasters just can't,
it's too much.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.336
So we use different techniques
to be able to look ahead.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.136
And some of these techniques
include chunking,

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.616
which means taking a group,
a chess position,

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.496
and seeing what possibilities
can come from just that group;

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.856
or pattern recognition,

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.136
which is just going over a lot
of positions that look very similarly

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.856
and extrapolating truths from that;

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.176
the stepping-stone method,

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.936
which is to take a position,
freeze it in your mind,

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.616
and go from there
to guess the next position.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.816
But one of my favorites

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.856
that I love to solve
these kind of chess puzzles,

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.656
is called retrograde analysis.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.585
And what you do with retrograde analysis

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:20.529
is that in order to look ahead,
it pays to look backwards.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.896
Now, why is this so useful?

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.176
Well, in chess,
it's a very complicated case.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.456
You got all these chess pieces,
it's 32 pieces,

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.536
but after five moves, the position
starts to evolve a little bit.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.096
And the game starts to go on

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.896
and you see the chess position
get a little simpler,

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.936
and a little bit simpler,
and less pieces on the board,

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.176
until finally --

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.216
in this case, a game that I played
in a tournament in Foxwoods,

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.336
it gets to something like this.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.376
When great players play,
it often gets to something like this.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.736
You don't see some easy, early checkmate.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.696
Grandmasters see through all that stuff.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.376
What you see is some end game,
something really, really simple.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.576
And we like to study things like this,

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.816
grandmasters do,

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.016
so that if we get to them,
we know how to play them cold,

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.576
but also so that we can steer
the position that's in front of us,

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.455
the more complex ones you saw earlier,

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.176
to something this easy,

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.656
something this simple.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.576
So in this way, when you're dead,

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.376
I already knew like ten moves ago,

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.416
because I knew where we were going.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.936
Now, why is this so effective?

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.496
Well, it's something about the human mind,
the problem with the human mind.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.936
We're very logical creatures.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.496
So I want you to play along
with me a few games.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.317
Take a look at this sentence.

00:02:31.341 --> 00:02:32.801
[After reading this sentence,

00:02:32.825 --> 00:02:36.296
you will realize that the brain
doesn't recognize a second "the."]

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.576
Now, most of you reading the sentence
the second time around

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.096
will realize that you missed
the word "the"

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.736
the first time around.

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.376
Your mind is very logical,
it proceeds forward,

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.216
it just ignores anything
that breaks with its logical stream,

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.621
and so you don't see
the word "the" the first time,

00:02:52.645 --> 00:02:54.936
the second "the,"
the first time you read it.

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:59.216
But if you read this sentence backwards,
you would automatically catch it.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.136
You'd go backwards,
and you get to "brain," you get to "the,"

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.176
and then you say, "Whoa,
there are two 'the's' in the sentence."

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.656
This is a really cool trick
for proofreading papers.

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.576
You're writing your paper
and there are these silly mistakes.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.296
Why are these mistakes in my paper?

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.576
You read it backwards,
you'll catch all of them.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.616
Alright, let's go on to this problem,
an interesting problem.

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.416
"Bacteria that double every 24 hours

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.600
fill a lake it has infested
after precisely 60 days.

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.400
On what day was the lake half-full?"

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.016
Now, a lot of people see this problem

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.216
and they'd think, "30, like,
you know, you split it in half."

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:36.976
Well, that's not the right answer.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.976
And also people might want a calculator.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.256
It's too big, it's math, it's boring,
I don't want to do that either.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.496
But if you do this problem backwards,
you get the answer right away.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.616
What's the answer? 59, obviously.

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.536
You start at the end, you go backwards,

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.936
it's like, "Oh yeah,
it's half-full, the answer is 59."

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:56.456
Here's another puzzle,
a little bit more complicated.

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.616
You have six numbers, 1 through 6.

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.016
The cards are face down.

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.736
You and I are going to pick a card.

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.746
You pick a card and you look at it
and it says the number 2.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.536
I look at my card,
I think about it for a minute

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.696
and I say, "I want to trade."

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.056
The reason I want to trade,

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:14.216
we're going to trade to see
who has the highest number at the end.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.480
Do you trade with me?

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.016
Most people say,
"Of course, I got a 2, 2 sucks!

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:25.176
There are four numbers higher,
probability says I'm going to do better."

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.016
Wrong answer,
you're playing a grandmaster.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.136
You start from the back
and you work it out.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.336
If I had the number 6,
would I offer to trade?

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.856
Of course not, I'm not dumb.

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.136
What about the number 5?

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.616
Probably not either, because you're
not going to say yes if you have a 6.

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.256
If 5 is not going to trade
and 6 is not going to trade,

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.496
4 is going to be like,

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.235
"I'm not trading either,
because 5's and 6's don't trade."

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:47.376
So you see what happens
as we work backwards.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.016
3 is going to realize:
4, 5, and 6 -- they don't trade,

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.496
so the offer is definitely a 1

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.917
and all of you who said yes,
thanks for your money.

00:04:53.941 --> 00:04:55.456
(Laughter)

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:00.056
So, this retrograde analysis
is used in different places.

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.656
It's used to prove intoxications
hours after an alleged DUI

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.896
by Pennsylvania police officers,

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:08.136
which is kind of cool.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.376
Well, it means don't drink and drive.

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.736
The use of retro-analysis is used in law,
science, medicine, insurance,

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.416
stock market, politics, career planning.

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:19.216
But I find its use
to be in a more interesting place,

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.896
maybe one of the most
interesting uses is in this movie,

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:24.416
which I know a lot of you know,

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.456
"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,"

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:31.016
where Brad Pitt plays a guy
who's living his life backwards.

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:35.136
And what this movie makes me
think of is that great quote,

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.896
that quote you often hear
from people who are older,

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:41.120
that youth is wasted on the young.

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.216
Well, if you can see the end game,

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.160
your youth will not be wasted on you.

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:48.936
Thank you very much.

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.826
(Applause)
