00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:19.910 align:start position:0%
didn't know until like the 80s I think
 

00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:21.639 align:start position:0%
didn't know until like the 80s I think
that<00:12:20.060><c> asbestos</c><00:12:20.540><c> was</c><00:12:20.660><c> dangerous</c><00:12:21.170><c> so</c><00:12:21.199><c> I</c><00:12:21.380><c> guess</c>

00:12:21.639 --> 00:12:21.649 align:start position:0%
that asbestos was dangerous so I guess
 

00:12:21.649 --> 00:12:25.269 align:start position:0%
that asbestos was dangerous so I guess
this<00:12:21.860><c> is</c><00:12:22.040><c> like</c><00:12:22.069><c> a</c><00:12:23.380><c> makes</c><00:12:24.380><c> sense</c><00:12:24.649><c> for</c><00:12:24.920><c> that</c><00:12:24.949><c> time</c>

00:12:25.269 --> 00:12:25.279 align:start position:0%
this is like a makes sense for that time
 

00:12:25.279 --> 00:12:27.340 align:start position:0%
this is like a makes sense for that time
very<00:12:25.639><c> illogical</c><00:12:26.180><c> leap</c><00:12:26.600><c> because</c><00:12:26.990><c> that's</c><00:12:27.230><c> your</c>

00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:27.350 align:start position:0%
very illogical leap because that's your
 

00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:31.370 align:start position:0%
very illogical leap because that's your
