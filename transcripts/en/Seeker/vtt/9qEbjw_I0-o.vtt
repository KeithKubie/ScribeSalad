00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:02.929
People seem to love stuff like bungee jumping
and sky-diving.

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:06.770
But what draws us to these scary life-threatening
experiences?

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:11.040
Why do we want to jump off of stuff?

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:21.490
On May 16, 2015, Dean Potter, a celebrated
extreme sportsman, and a fellow climber, Graham

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.449
Hunt; jumped off a 7,500 foot (2,285m) cliff
in Yosemite National Park with the goal of

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:30.600
wingsuit flying through the rocky cliffs before
parachuting to safety.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:35.560
Both men crashed while trying to fly through
an outcropping and were found dead many hours

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:36.560
later.

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:41.079
BASE jumping is an acronym for buildings,
antennas, spans (such as bridges) and Earth

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:46.079
(cliffs and mountaintops) -- all places to
jump from while wearing a wingsuit, parachute

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.079
or both.

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:51.870
At least 257 people have died BASE jumping
to date, according to a major BASE jumping

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.020
forum; and Potter, who was a major enthusiast
for outdoor "extreme" sports, called BASE

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.989
jumping and free-climbing, "death-consequence"
activities.

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.290
Aren't we all programmed to survive?

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.819
Why do we risk death for a thrill?

00:01:05.819 --> 00:01:10.450
More than 800 people have died climbing the
mountains of Nepal -- including Everest,;

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:17.450
442 from skydiving from 1998 to 2014 - and
even scuba-diving sees about 80 deaths annually.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.310
I mean, skateboarding had 30 deaths in 2012!

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:26.279
Psychologists believe we perform risky behaviors
because of our fear response, and medical

00:01:26.279 --> 00:01:29.729
researchers believe it has to do with the
brain's reward systems; though both are true.

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.770
In a small study from the Queensland University
of Technology in Australia; researchers explored

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.389
the psychological result of fear responses
in extreme sports participants.

00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:41.240
Fear is an important inborn response to perceived
danger.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.739
Your body's top priority is to preserve itself;
fear is a way to motivate it to do so.

00:01:45.739 --> 00:01:51.899
But for some people, overcoming fear was a
meaningful and constructive event in their

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:52.899
lives.

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:58.770
They still EXPERIENCE fear, but it's not seen
as a negative, but rather, a positive experience.

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.539
Potter wrote specifically, and poetically,
about his experiences with fear, and how overcoming

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:06.009
that fear was transformative for him.

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:11.590
Unfortunately, that's not easily translatable
for a general population -- instead we can

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.709
only look at how the chemicals in our brains
surrounding fear go on to affect our behavior.

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.510
When jumping out of an airplane or free-climbing
up a cliff, an almond-shaped set of neurons

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.849
in our brain called the amygdala releases
hormones which quicken the heart, hone the

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:30.269
senses and prepare your body to flee or fight.

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:35.519
During this fear response, our brains' reward
center releases large amounts of dopamine.

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:40.609
Studies have shown, dopamine, a powerful reward
chemical for our bodies, is also connected

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:42.819
to the recollection of terror.

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:47.609
It's released when we eat, exercise, or talk
to our friends and family, and reinforces

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:52.799
those healthy behaviors by making us feel
good about doing those things.

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:58.660
But, massive dopamine release is associated
with drug use, and addiction; which is how

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:04.010
extreme athletes and enthusiasts are often
associated with junkies or addicts.

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.840
Extreme athletes provoke this fear response
in themselves, experiencing the fear of death,

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.470
and enjoying the natural-high they get from
the dopamine release that follows.

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:19.080
The problem is, the brain can get used to
high-levels of dopamine, and thus, more extreme

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.700
events may have to be performed to simply
enjoy day-to-day life.

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.260
This is called sensation-seeking behavior;
language created to describe heavy-use drug

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:28.260
addicts.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.870
A 2004 study compared ecstasy-users to bungee-jumpers
and found similar sensation-seeking brain

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:34.870
chemistry.

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.530
The reason people continue to do these activities,
aside from them being fun and making them

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.780
feel good, is once their brain gets acclimated
to higher levels of dopamine, it's difficult

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.209
to wean it off.

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:49.219
Like an addict, the brain craves MORE dopamine
to feel the same high.

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:53.170
In the end, the risk and reward are real,
and people can alter their brain chemistry

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.779
to get a "natural high" from things like BASE
jumping.

00:03:55.779 --> 00:03:59.189
But I'm not trying to condemn people who seek
out sensations.

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:05.480
Sure, Dean Potter participated in dangerous
behaviors, but he ALSO inspired people all

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.569
over the globe to explore their planet first-hand;
to get off their couches and into their National

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:16.780
Parks; into their world, and to try their
hand at things they may not have otherwise.

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.500
Extreme sports can extend to long-distance
races like marathons or ultra-marathons; but

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.770
this man is 104 and still runs races.

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:27.130
So they can't be THAT dangerous, right?

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:43.840
Seeker Daily reveals a man who just won't
quit running (soundup) Thanks for watching

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.870
DNews, get out there and do something today.
