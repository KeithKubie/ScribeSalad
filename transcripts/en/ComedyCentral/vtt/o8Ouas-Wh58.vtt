(lowkey ambient music)

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:13.313
- Hey!

00:00:13.313 --> 00:00:16.549 align:start size:72% position:28%
(upbeat music)
C'mon in!

00:00:19.452 --> 00:00:20.286
Yes!

00:00:20.286 --> 00:00:21.221
Push and Believe.

00:00:21.221 --> 00:00:22.322
You got it!

00:00:22.322 --> 00:00:24.057
Dan, during the commercial break

00:00:24.057 --> 00:00:26.092 align:start size:88% position:13%
I was doing some
research, and thinking,

00:00:26.092 --> 00:00:27.293
and I thought,

00:00:27.293 --> 00:00:29.329 line:0%
let's get away from
these questions,

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:32.365 align:start size:94% position:6% line:0%
from these PAs, from
these writers' assistants.

00:00:32.365 --> 00:00:34.300 align:start size:88% position:13%
who give me this stuff.
- Great.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.970 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Would you mind,
possibly, putting these on?

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:40.006
It might be a flashback for me.

00:00:40.006 --> 00:00:40.840
- OKay.

00:00:42.242 --> 00:00:46.713 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Wow, that's an uncanny
resemblance to my good friend

00:00:46.713 --> 00:00:48.882
Zack Galifianakis
from The Hangover.

00:00:48.882 --> 00:00:50.283
- Yeah, yeah.
- Be Zack.

00:00:50.283 --> 00:00:51.951
Become Zack.
- No, this is,

00:00:51.951 --> 00:00:53.486
that is something that
sounds horrible for me.

00:00:53.486 --> 00:00:54.521
- Please be Zack.

00:00:54.521 --> 00:00:55.488
- No, it's not.

00:00:55.488 --> 00:00:56.790
- Please buy me lunch.

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.224
- I'm sorry you couldn't
book Zack for this show.

00:00:58.224 --> 00:01:00.126
- Please take me out
to an Oscar party.

00:01:00.126 --> 00:01:01.294
- I can't, I don't know.

00:01:01.294 --> 00:01:02.762
- I wanna meet Bono.

00:01:02.762 --> 00:01:04.297 align:start size:94% position:6%
- At best I could take
you to a Cable Ace Awards.

00:01:04.297 --> 00:01:05.632
- All right, I can see that
you're getting irritated

00:01:05.632 --> 00:01:06.566
with the glasses.

00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:07.500
- Uh, yeah.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.468
- Well take the glasses off!

00:01:08.468 --> 00:01:09.569
- All right, there we go.

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:11.871
- So Dan, I have father issues,

00:01:11.871 --> 00:01:16.476
and I read in your bio that
you too have father issues.

00:01:16.476 --> 00:01:17.777 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Yes.
- Do you go to therapy?

00:01:17.777 --> 00:01:19.312
- Not, I mean, not really.

00:01:19.312 --> 00:01:21.448
- Do you do yoga,
do you exercise?

00:01:21.448 --> 00:01:23.450 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Well, you know, I've been
trying to get into exercising,

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:24.451
but I really haven't.

00:01:24.451 --> 00:01:25.385
I don't really know what to do.

00:01:25.385 --> 00:01:26.653
- I'll tell you what I do.

00:01:26.653 --> 00:01:27.587
Push-ups.

00:01:27.587 --> 00:01:29.956
You just push up, push up,

00:01:29.956 --> 00:01:31.591
you're pushing the pain,

00:01:31.591 --> 00:01:33.927
and you're bringing
in the positivity.

00:01:33.927 --> 00:01:35.095
Is your father still around?

00:01:35.095 --> 00:01:36.362
- He's still around.

00:01:36.362 --> 00:01:37.597
- You know, I wish I
could get him here,

00:01:37.597 --> 00:01:39.933 align:start size:84% position:16%
fly him up here, get
him on the phone.

00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:41.234
But that's not possible.

00:01:41.234 --> 00:01:42.769
- No, what are we
gonna do instead?

00:01:42.769 --> 00:01:44.871
- I say we get the table,
move it out of the way,

00:01:44.871 --> 00:01:46.773
turn this interview

00:01:46.773 --> 00:01:48.975 align:start size:84% position:16%
on its head!
- We're gonna do it!

00:01:48.975 --> 00:01:50.477
- Yes!
- Yeah!

00:01:50.477 --> 00:01:54.380 align:start size:97% position:3% line:0%
- Welcome to the Steven Brody
Stevens push up challenge

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.684 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
as I prepare for
dealing with my father.

00:01:57.684 --> 00:01:59.152
So this is what I do.

00:01:59.152 --> 00:02:00.720
I'll go first, and
then you can go,

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.188
then we'll do it tandem.

00:02:02.188 --> 00:02:04.724
Head up, body straight.

it's not about you.

00:02:34.721 --> 00:02:35.922

00:02:35.922 --> 00:02:36.990
- Go ahead, I'm here with you.

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.558
- Okay, thank you so much.

00:02:38.558 --> 00:02:40.326
- I don't want your life, dad!

00:02:40.326 --> 00:02:41.261
- Say it!

00:02:41.261 --> 00:02:42.228
- I don't want your life!

00:02:42.228 --> 00:02:43.463
- Believe it!

00:02:43.463 --> 00:02:44.931
- Working out dad issues
while I'm working out!

00:02:44.931 --> 00:02:46.799
- He can hear you from
Boston and New Jersey.

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:47.634
- Yes!

00:02:47.634 --> 00:02:49.169
- Yell in that carpet!

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:50.904
- Can I do a new move where I
just get in a fetal position

00:02:50.904 --> 00:02:51.905
and I start crying?

00:02:51.905 --> 00:02:53.873
- You can, and I will hold you.

00:02:53.873 --> 00:02:54.707
Dan, it's okay.

00:02:54.707 --> 00:02:55.975
Dan, it's okay!

00:02:55.975 --> 00:02:57.911 align:start size:94% position:6%
(crying)
Dan it's okay, it's okay.

00:02:57.911 --> 00:02:59.045
- Making me feel good.

00:02:59.045 --> 00:02:59.913
- It's okay.

00:02:59.913 --> 00:03:01.114
Dan St. Germain.

Check him out,
half hour special.

00:03:02.715 --> 00:03:03.816
Yes!

00:03:03.816 --> 00:03:04.884
Push and Believe.

00:03:04.884 --> 00:03:07.687 line:0%
