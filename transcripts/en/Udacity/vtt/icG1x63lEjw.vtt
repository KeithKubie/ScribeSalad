00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.630
So now we need to add work flow actions and what work flow actions are, are

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:05.660
simply the things that are going to you know,

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:07.450
fire as soon as that criteria is met.

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:08.280
&gt;&gt; Can we add an email?

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.560
&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's do that.

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:10.750
&gt;&gt; So this is going to email our technician.

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:12.460
&gt;&gt; It's going to to immediately email them

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:14.450
for records created and they have an email.

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:16.340
&gt;&gt; So this thing can be email technician.

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.890
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.440
&gt;&gt; Email template, so what's that for?

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.120
&gt;&gt; So, in Salesforce you can create e-mail templates that use merge fields,

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.460
similar to what we've already seen in our formulas.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.880
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.870
&gt;&gt; And so it auto-populates with fields off of

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:32.070
that object, so you can say something like, Dear

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.210
&gt;&gt; Bob.

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.360
&gt;&gt; Technician's name. Yeah.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.620
&gt;&gt; Okay. That's pretty cool. and, have you kindly made this template already?

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:39.750
&gt;&gt; I have.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:40.270
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Sam.

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.030
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So pick the Maintenance Notification, not the solution.

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.720
&gt;&gt; Okay. And recipient Type. What's this all about?

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.080
&gt;&gt; So we can dynamically

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:56.290
assign who the recipient is based off of, you know, maybe they're

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.370
part of a queue and we wanted to go to a maintenance queue.

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.060
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm. Or maybe they have a specific role. And so,

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.680
we're trying to dynamically determine who should receive it by role.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:03.020
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.780
&gt;&gt; But in this case, we could use the related user.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.020
Which is the mobile technician that we have associated with the record.

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.540
&gt;&gt; So, we'll use technician.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:11.760
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.110
&gt;&gt; And then from current user's email sounds fine to me.

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:16.740
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:17.340
&gt;&gt; And Save?

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.180
&gt;&gt; Sounds good.
