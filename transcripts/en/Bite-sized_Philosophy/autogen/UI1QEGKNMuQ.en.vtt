so 80 percent of humanities papers don't

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000
so 80 percent of humanities papers don't
 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.619
so 80 percent of humanities papers don't
get cited once it's absolute failure

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629
get cited once it's absolute failure

absolute failure as a game if someone
 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.689
absolute failure as a game if someone
wanted to play a game I would suggest

I going to get taught the same course
again and again by every professor in

this program because it seems to me that

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229
this program because it seems to me that
 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.149
this program because it seems to me that
all of their researches is very similar

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:28.159
all of their researches is very similar
 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:31.460
all of their researches is very similar
and how can that be when there's such a

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470
and how can that be when there's such a
 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.289
and how can that be when there's such a
broad base of knowledge in the world

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299
broad base of knowledge in the world
 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.010
broad base of knowledge in the world
that we can have such similarity between

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020
that we can have such similarity between
 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.980
that we can have such similarity between

that's failure right it means your work

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100
that's failure right it means your work
 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.340
that's failure right it means your work

wasn't worth the paper it was published

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270
wasn't worth the paper it was published
 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.630
wasn't worth the paper it was published
on and this this brings us to a kind of

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640
on and this this brings us to a kind of
 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.820
on and this this brings us to a kind of
interesting little issue with regards to

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830
interesting little issue with regards to
 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.860
interesting little issue with regards to
the rot in the universities which which

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870
the rot in the universities which which
 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.750

Deborah McLeod she says does not exist
it's like here's how the game works is

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350
it's like here's how the game works is
 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.880
it's like here's how the game works is
that we set up a little ideological

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890
that we set up a little ideological
 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.650
that we set up a little ideological
garden right the ten of us play in and

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660
garden right the ten of us play in and
 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.020
garden right the ten of us play in and
then we all publish in the same journal

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030
then we all publish in the same journal
 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.880
then we all publish in the same journal
and we peer review each other's articles

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890
and we peer review each other's articles
 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.950
and we peer review each other's articles
and we just publish them there's no

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:49.960
and we just publish them there's no
 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.970
and we just publish them there's no
critique or very little so the the

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980
critique or very little so the the
 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.890
critique or very little so the the
barrier for publication is very very low

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900
barrier for publication is very very low
 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.480
barrier for publication is very very low
when it should be very high like a good

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:57.490
when it should be very high like a good
 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:00.300
when it should be very high like a good
journal a good journal will reject 90%

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310
journal a good journal will reject 90%
 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.290
journal a good journal will reject 90%
of the papers that are that are

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300
of the papers that are that are
 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:08.040
of the papers that are that are
submitted to it right so rejection rates

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050
submitted to it right so rejection rates
 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.880
submitted to it right so rejection rates
really matter so the question is why do

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890
really matter so the question is why do
 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.640
really matter so the question is why do
the these papers get published since no

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650
the these papers get published since no
 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.530
the these papers get published since no
one reads them and they have nothing to

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540
one reads them and they have nothing to
 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:17.880
one reads them and they have nothing to
offer and the answer to that it's very

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890
offer and the answer to that it's very
 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.250
offer and the answer to that it's very
straightforward the journals are

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260
straightforward the journals are
 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.259
straightforward the journals are
extremely expensive are way more

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269
extremely expensive are way more
 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:23.699
extremely expensive are way more
expensive than they should be so just to

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709
expensive than they should be so just to
 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:26.160
expensive than they should be so just to
buy a single paper online for the

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170
buy a single paper online for the
 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:27.960
buy a single paper online for the
ordinary person is like forty dollars

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970
ordinary person is like forty dollars
 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.160
ordinary person is like forty dollars
which is more than a hardcover book

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170
which is more than a hardcover book
 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.860
which is more than a hardcover book
that's just to download the PDF and so

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870
that's just to download the PDF and so
 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.750
that's just to download the PDF and so
the journal itself the libraries are

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760
the journal itself the libraries are
 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.250
the journal itself the libraries are
full of them are very expensive and the

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260
full of them are very expensive and the
 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.900
full of them are very expensive and the
subscriptions are very expensive and so

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910
subscriptions are very expensive and so
 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.420
subscriptions are very expensive and so
what happens is the professors pressure

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430
what happens is the professors pressure
 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.220
what happens is the professors pressure
the university libraries to buy the

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230
the university libraries to buy the
 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.070
the university libraries to buy the
journals and the library funds the

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.080
journals and the library funds the
 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.259
journals and the library funds the
publisher and so the publishers will

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:46.269
publisher and so the publishers will
 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:47.820
publisher and so the publishers will
publish anything Routledge is a good
