NATHAN PHILLIPS: Where
we are scientists--

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.750
I'm speaking as a
professional scientist--

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.350
and the wall they we're hitting
in communicating our science,

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:35.040
and having things
translate out of there--

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.850
I'm aware of a
paper that was just

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.220
published a few weeks ago
that's on the importance

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.550
of storytelling in science.

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:47.390
And that they found that some
published journal articles that

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.120
had more of a narrative
structure are getting

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.510
cited more because people
want to hear stories.

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.137
The dry, scientific, just
the facts aren't working.

00:00:58.137 --> 00:00:59.220
They want to hear stories.

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.500
So I want to share
my story with you

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.970
about how I got involved
in this gas leak stuff,

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.490
and then I'll hand
the baton to Audrey,

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.900
and she'll take it from there.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.110
But I started about this thing
about the methane gas leaks

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.930
as a citizen.

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.770
This started in
2010, November 2010,

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.550
for me, walking two blocks
away from our home in Newton,

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.380
in the Auburndale
village of Newton,

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.080
with my 10-year-old son,
who was 7 or 8 years old

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.345
at the time, Julian.

00:01:34.345 --> 00:01:36.800
And two blocks
away from our home,

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.260
we came upon a gas
leak, and someone

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:44.360
who was working on gas leaks,
Bob Ackely, Gas Safety USA.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.290
He's a 30-year
professional, non-scientist,

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.860
but that curiosity, what
are you doing there.

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.880
He looked like Ghostbusters
with a metal detector,

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.730
but it was a gas meter.

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.650
And that's how I got
involved in understanding

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.080
this problem with gas leaks.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.210
So it was as a citizen.

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.240
And for me, that has
started a process

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:14.480
by which I've grown
as a scientist citizen

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.710
and come into a community
science framework,

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:22.975
working with Audrey and a
whole group of other citizens

00:02:22.975 --> 00:02:23.600
in a community.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.060
And we've defined,
I think, a community

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.640
that crosses all
types of boundaries

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.250
to address the
problem of gas leaks.

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.670
So from that first
chance citizen

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:43.700
kind of experience for me, till
2013, the science part of this

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.080
developed that we mapped out
over 3,000 of these gas leaks

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.950
in the city of Boston.

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.530
And then we followed it up with
a study in which we estimated

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.620
that the amount of gas being
lost in Eastern Massachusetts

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.720
amounted to about 10% of the
Commonwealth's greenhouse gas

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.700
emissions inventory.

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:13.760
So that propelled a coalition
of a community to then say,

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.160
how do we move our
political leaders

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.310
to actually create policy
to address this situation?

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.800
So it's been a really
fulfilling thing for me.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.925
And I will say that the
science that we did, actually,

00:03:25.925 --> 00:03:31.670
and what we published in
the journals, is not new.

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.000
The problem had been
known about for decades.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.980
It's just that it was
not known to the public.

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.970
So we found citizen
after citizens

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.160
in different neighborhoods
of Boston that would say,

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.840
oh yeah, I know
about a gas leak.

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.535
I smell it every time I
go walking to the store.

00:03:47.535 --> 00:03:49.550
And so what we
realized is that there

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:53.810
were hundreds of anecdotes
that were completely

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.560
siloed from each other.

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.930
And once we put a map
out there, the community,

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.270
everyone could see the
whole thing collectively

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:03.570
at the same time.

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.330
And that was the
only thing we did.

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.540
We just made it visible.

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.520
And Audrey took it
to the next step,

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.302
and I'll pass the baton to you.

00:04:12.302 --> 00:04:13.468
AUDREY SCHULMAN: OK, thanks.

00:04:13.468 --> 00:04:15.680
So I'm just going to
talk for one second

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.490
about what actually
gas leaks are, since--

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:21.200
from pipes under
the street, right?

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.780
So a lot of our pipes under
our street are really old.

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:28.040
Here's a close up detail of
back bay, a National Grid map,

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.890
very small detail of it,
and you can see that two

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:32.420
of the pipes running down--

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:37.550
the 1860 one is a pipe from
1860 running down Beacon Street.

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:42.830
And two streets away running
down Comm Ave is one from 1882.

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:44.880
And those pipes
are still in use.

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:50.229
So we've got some really
old infrastructure around.

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:52.770
The problem with gas leaks is,
they're potentially explosive.

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:56.600
This is a picture of the
explosion in Harlem about two

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.920
years ago, I think 2014.

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:04.050
As they gas percolates
up through the soil it,

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.810
pushes oxygen out
and trees actually

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:08.910
need to breathe oxygen
through their roots.

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:10.530
So they can die.

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:17.700
And then it's, as Nathan said,
a powerful greenhouse gas.

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:22.080
If you burn natural gas,
it's turned into CO2.

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.870
If you don't burn it,
it stays as methane.

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.960
Methane, on a
20-year time frame,

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:32.970
is 86 times more
damaging than CO2.

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:35.630
And finally, we
have to pay for it

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:37.560
because the utilities
can pass that cost

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.960
on to us, the ratepayers.

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.040
So it's sort of just insulting.

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:45.090
So when I read about
Nathan's first,

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:47.860
I run an energy
efficiency nonprofit.

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:51.870
And primarily, we used to work
in the buildings of nonprofits

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:54.870
to help them lower their energy
bills and energy emissions.

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:57.840
And so then, a lot
with Mass Save,

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:01.380
which is the state's
energy efficiency

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:03.850
state-funded program.

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:06.330
And so I read about
Nathan's research

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:08.700
when he surveyed all
of Boston and found

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:11.090
those over 3,300 gas leaks.

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:12.840
And there was one line
in the article that

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:18.930
said that the amount of gas
lost in just Boston alone

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:21.810
totally erased all of the
state's energy efficiency

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:23.890
programs.

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:25.980
And so I was that was it.

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:27.780
I was in.

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:32.730
So I called up Nathan
and said, how can I help?

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:35.670
And he was kind
enough to loan us

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:38.790
his extremely fancy
cool equipment, which

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:43.150
is called the Picarro High
Precision Natural Gas Analyzer.

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:47.190
And we drove it all over
Cambridge and Somerville.

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:50.370
So the yellow lines
are where we drove--

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:52.350
or not, we Bob Ackley--

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:55.110
drove.

00:06:55.110 --> 00:07:00.060
And the spikes are where there
is elevated levels of methane

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:02.460
found.

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:04.260
And it's sort of fascinating.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:09.060
We found no correlation between
income level of neighborhoods.

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:14.330
Because they're
just-- you'll see them

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:16.610
sort of somewhat
clustered together

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:19.100
because neighborhoods are
built at the same time,

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:22.130
generally, using the same
infrastructure, same material.

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:30.170
Here's what I call the
Alps of North Somerville.

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:34.760
And we will be going, we'll
be doing a leak survey

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:37.970
in the fantastic van
with the Picarro,

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:41.840
so you can come along and
see these on your own,

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:45.990
and do some surveying
on your own.

00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:47.930
AUDIENCE: And smell it.

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:49.971
AUDREY SCHULMAN: Yeah, I
mean we can also smell--

00:07:49.971 --> 00:07:52.257
see what's fascinating to
me, is like, near my house--

00:07:52.257 --> 00:07:53.840
I would always bike
along the Charles,

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:55.340
and there was just
one huge gas leak

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:56.780
I would smell all the time.

00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:59.067
And I would always
think, like, can't

00:07:59.067 --> 00:08:00.650
be because I'm looking
around, and I'm

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:03.030
seeing all the other people,
and they're just walking by.

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:06.890
So I always thought, like,
I must just be making it up.

00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:07.952
But then I called it in.

00:08:07.952 --> 00:08:08.660
And it was fixed.

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:11.090
And after that, I
never smelled it again.

00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:14.790
And that was so-- like we
just don't believe our noses.

00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:18.980
So after we did the
Cambridge Somerville work,

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:21.320
I thought, we've got to
scale this up somehow.

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:27.450
I found some arcane data on the
Department of Public Utilities

00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:32.030
site, where they have to give
a lot of information, including

00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:35.750
this, which--

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:38.429
over 300 pages of
this sort of stuff.

00:08:38.429 --> 00:08:41.526
But you'll see that there's
actually addresses there.

00:08:41.526 --> 00:08:43.400
So as soon as I saw that
there were addresses

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:48.650
showing where the leaks were,
I thought, cool, I can map it.

00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:54.410
So I mapped every gas leak in
Massachusetts on Google Maps,

00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:55.940
so they're zoomable.

00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:59.790
Anybody can see them
at squeakyleak.org.

00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:05.420
The yellow map pins are where
the leaks are unrepaired,

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:09.800
and the reds are where they
were repaired the previous year.

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:13.310
And there's just a lot of them.

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:15.440
And this was some of the--

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:19.490
really transformative
for a lot of people,

00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:21.050
because then they
could actually see

00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:26.390
where the leaks were near their
home, near their kids school,

00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:27.950
near their business, et cetera.

00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:30.710
It made the, not only
invisible visible,

00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:35.030
but it also made
the global local.

00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:38.660
And then I'll finally finish
up with one last thing, which

00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:44.276
is some other parts
of Nathan's research,

00:09:44.276 --> 00:09:45.650
as well as Margaret
Hendrick, who

00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:49.495
is a graduate student, a
postdoctoral student here

00:09:49.495 --> 00:09:53.300
at BU, is they surveyed a
hundred gas leaks in Boston

00:09:53.300 --> 00:10:01.160
to find that just 7% of them
emit 50% of the gas by volume.

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.710
So that means-- as soon as
you know that, you know,

00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:07.610
OK, the whole thing is to
find and fix those leaks.

00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:11.150
So through a lot of
work, through all

00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:14.030
the different people who
are interested in this,

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:16.700
we managed to get,
we helped to get

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:19.430
a state law passed
that those leaks will

00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:22.025
have to be found and fixed.

00:10:22.025 --> 00:10:23.900
And so one of the things
we're going be doing

00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:26.720
is, at the hackathon,
we'll hopefully

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:29.630
be trying to figure
out a method that's

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:32.450
utility friendly
for the utilities

00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:37.940
to measure the emissions off of
each one of these theoretically

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:38.785
high volume leaks.

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:44.270
Because if we don't have
feedback for the system,

00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:48.050
they're probably going to find
whatever leaks are convenient

00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:50.000
and call those high
volume, and fix them.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.708
Because they don't
know how to do it yet.

00:10:51.708 --> 00:10:53.910
Nobody does-- how
to find the leaks.

00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:55.473
Yeah?

00:10:55.473 --> 00:10:57.240
AUDIENCE: Have you
checked on the response

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:58.756
of National Grid
or other utilities

00:10:58.756 --> 00:11:00.506
about their capacity
to repair these leaks

00:11:00.506 --> 00:11:02.881
and also compare that to the
new leaks that have emerged?

00:11:13.132 --> 00:11:15.465
AUDREY SCHULMAN: Yeah, I met
with a lot of other people.

00:11:15.465 --> 00:11:18.140
I met with National
Grid on Friday.

00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:22.010
They say they've hired a
whole bunch of new people,

00:11:22.010 --> 00:11:25.010
and they say they will have
the capacity to do this,

00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:27.770
to fix all these leaks.

00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:29.750
But what I want them
to do is be transparent

00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:33.890
about their
information so anybody

00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:35.729
can check that they
fixed the right leaks,

00:11:35.729 --> 00:11:38.270
that the leaks were fixed, that
you know, so on and so forth.

00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:42.290
Because the more
transparency we have,

00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:45.700
the more researchers can look
at stuff and citizens can, too.

00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:49.255
AUDIENCE: Is there color
coding near the [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:49.255 --> 00:11:52.790
AUDREY SCHULMAN: No, in
this case I was mapping,

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:55.000
the pink ones are
super-emitters,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.780
the high-volume gas leaks.

00:11:56.780 --> 00:11:58.900
The yellow ones are not.

00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:02.034
They're just normal gas leaks.

00:12:02.034 --> 00:12:03.950
NATHAN PHILLIPS: Maybe
I'll just add something

00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:07.580
about the community science
and the opportunities

00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:09.950
for just being creative here.

00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:13.160
And I think it's just is
embodied by the collaboration

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:17.840
that Audrey and I have so
well was, to do this study,

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:19.880
we had to think of
methods that were

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:24.710
a little out of the box, a
little bit about found objects

00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:25.640
fortuitous stuff.

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:29.302
Because there's no real kit
to measure gas leaks that you

00:12:29.302 --> 00:12:32.480
can buy from some-- we were
making this up as we go.

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:36.560
So, for example, we found out
that the best kind of chamber

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:39.490
to measure what's
coming out of man holes

00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:42.130
is a turtle shell
from a sandbox.

00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:46.600
So it fits right over
with a known volume,

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:50.440
and you get that for $20
instead of having a machine

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:52.760
shop make it for $1,000.

00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:54.680
So there's that
level of creativity.

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:57.980
And just yesterday
Audrey came up

00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:03.390
with the use of a pinwheel that
might be able the mix the air

00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:04.640
that we need to measure.

00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:06.290
And it's the kind
of thing that it's

00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:09.560
like, once she said that, it's
like, yeah perfect, you know,

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:10.340
a pinwheel.

00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:14.660
So I think, in the hackathon,
there will be opportunities

00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:18.380
to think about how we might
go about doing something

00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:23.060
in a cost-effective way
without doing it kind of like,

00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:26.720
you know, NASA does in
their multimillion dollar

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:28.250
laboratories.

00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:32.570
you find-- you had your test
going out with the truck.

00:13:32.570 --> 00:13:35.120
And then you had the
DPU emissions data.

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:38.760
Did you find any leaks that were
not on the DPU National Grid

00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:39.260
list?

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:40.343
AUDREY SCHULMAN: Oh, yeah.

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:46.430
With Metropolitan Area Planning
Council, HEET, my nonprofit,

00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:51.050
has done a survey of 15
different municipalities.

00:13:55.400 --> 00:14:00.440
We found 1.7 times more leaks
than the utilities reported.

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:02.300
And there's lots of
other stuff that we

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:09.370
found that makes us
question the utility data.

00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:10.314
NATHAN PHILLIPS: Paul.

00:14:10.314 --> 00:14:13.770
AUDIENCE: Nathan,
thank you [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:16.385
question and a comment.

00:14:16.385 --> 00:14:19.266
Question, how do you know where
the super emitters are now

00:14:19.266 --> 00:14:21.564
on the map, given
that you're still

00:14:21.564 --> 00:14:25.540
in the process of
measuring, as I understand?

00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:29.310
NATHAN PHILLIPS: So we did this
survey, the driving survey,

00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:33.060
that measured 3,356
leaks in Boston.

00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:34.497
But that's just detecting leaks.

00:14:34.497 --> 00:14:36.330
That doesn't tell us
how much is coming out.

00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:40.970
So then subsequently to that,
we went out with these chambers.

00:14:40.970 --> 00:14:42.960
Some of them were
the turtle shell.

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:45.550
Some of them were five gallon
buckets with a slot cut out

00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:47.040
so it could go up to a curd.

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:52.070
Because sometimes it comes
out these complex geometries.

00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:56.340
And so we did the laborious
task of going back

00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:59.880
to 100 of those 3,356 leaks.

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:02.430
And measuring how much just
coming out using this chamber

00:15:02.430 --> 00:15:03.756
technique.

00:15:03.756 --> 00:15:06.730
And from that the statistics
of those 100 leaks

00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:09.660
showed that seven
of them accounted

00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:13.320
for 50% of the total lost gas.

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:15.240
AUDIENCE: So you've
done a sample, but not

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:17.749
comprehesive in any regard.

00:15:17.749 --> 00:15:18.790
NATHAN PHILLIPS: Exactly.

00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:21.510
It might be more like-- if we
get the whole thing over again,

00:15:21.510 --> 00:15:26.070
maybe pick another 100 leaks,
it may be that 10 of them

00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:28.970
accounted for 50%, or maybe 6.

00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:31.840
Right, it was a sample.

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:34.860
We know that it's not
a bell shaped curve,

00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:36.304
and you've got an average leak.

00:15:36.304 --> 00:15:37.720
And some were a
little bit higher.

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:39.094
And some were a
little bit lower.

00:15:39.094 --> 00:15:41.180
The distribution
has a long tail.

00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:43.476
There's a few big ones.

00:15:43.476 --> 00:15:44.970
And a lot of small ones.

00:15:44.970 --> 00:15:47.882
AUDIENCE: Now my comment is
antecdotal, but it's true.

00:15:47.882 --> 00:15:51.950
In one town that I was working
with, I won't name the town,

00:15:51.950 --> 00:15:55.725
the report was that when
they had a gas leak,

00:15:55.725 --> 00:15:58.470
and the citizen complained
enough, that they would exactly

00:15:58.470 --> 00:15:59.660
come out and fix the leak.

00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:03.110
But they didn't fix it
well the first time.

00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:06.750
They sometimes have to come
back and do it five times.

00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:10.115
And the reason for that
is that the gas companies

00:16:10.115 --> 00:16:14.790
get paid based on the
amount of work that they do.

00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:17.160
So if they do the same
work over and over again,

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:19.860
the get paid each time for it.

00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:23.700
So as you're engaging in this
mentoring and monitoring,

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:26.100
I do completely
agree with the fact

00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:31.140
that some amount of
oversight, or review,

00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:35.995
or checking up on ones that
they say have been fixed

00:16:35.995 --> 00:16:39.700
would be a good
part of the plan.

00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:42.530
AUDREY SCHULMAN: Yeah,
I think transparency

00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:45.550
and watchdogs are
good for any industry.

00:16:48.854 --> 00:16:53.410
AUDIENCE: Have you projected,
just in a dream-like way,

00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:57.212
how much gas could be
contained, and how much

00:16:57.212 --> 00:17:00.309
that would reduce any demand?

00:17:00.309 --> 00:17:01.850
NATHAN PHILLIPS: So
the best estimate

00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:07.000
that we have for amount of
lost gas comes from a study

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.250
that we did in
collaboration with Harvard

00:17:09.250 --> 00:17:14.050
University, Catherine McKain,
Steve Wofsy and their lab.

00:17:14.050 --> 00:17:17.050
And we estimated that
a little less than 3%

00:17:17.050 --> 00:17:19.720
of the amount gas that's
delivered into the service area

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:21.760
is leaked out.

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:25.300
So that may not sound
like a lot, the 3%,

00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:29.780
but because of the power of
methane as a greenhouse gas,

00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:32.270
it has an outsized effect.

00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:35.380
And so that's why a 3%
turns into about 10%

00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:39.010
of the total commonwealth's
greenhouse gas emissions

00:17:39.010 --> 00:17:40.210
inventory at that level.

00:17:40.210 --> 00:17:45.310
So if you took that 3%
leaked gas down to zero,

00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:49.240
you'd save the commonwealth 10%
of its greenhouse gas emissions

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:50.440
inventory.

00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:52.890
And about $90 million
dollars per year

00:17:52.890 --> 00:17:55.570
was the cost of the
commodity at the time

00:17:55.570 --> 00:17:57.670
that the study was done.

00:17:57.670 --> 00:18:00.612
Gas is volatile so
that number changes.

00:18:00.612 --> 00:18:02.320
AUDIENCE: But there's
another observation

00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:04.730
in that, which is
that 3% just in itself

00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:11.017
would reduce to peak load
demand for gas by 3%.

00:18:11.017 --> 00:18:13.160
And when they talk
about new pipelines,

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:18.168
they're increasingly talking
about a 5% definciancy

00:18:18.168 --> 00:18:21.034
in our peak load capacity level.

00:18:21.034 --> 00:18:24.380
So you can definitely
mitigate the need

00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:27.050
for disposing the new
pipelines if you were

00:18:27.050 --> 00:18:28.300
to come out and fix the leaks.

00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:30.591
NATHAN PHILLIPS: That is an
excellent, excellent point.

00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:36.140
We'll do here and then there.

00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:37.610
AUDIENCE: Don't
you have a problem

00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:40.774
of how you put all
these dollars together,

00:18:40.774 --> 00:18:43.656
because there's $90 million
dollars that I understand

00:18:43.656 --> 00:18:47.795
that ratepayers paying the leak
gas that we don't know about.

00:18:47.795 --> 00:18:49.805
We don't know her.

00:18:49.805 --> 00:18:53.200
And then there's this fund that
they have for fixing leaks.

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:55.733
And then there's
the mountain lines

00:18:55.733 --> 00:18:58.642
that they're using for
developing a new pipeline.

00:18:58.642 --> 00:19:02.162
And those are all coming out of
different pocketbooks, I think.

00:19:02.162 --> 00:19:04.182
And it seems that if
you don't figure out

00:19:04.182 --> 00:19:07.315
how to put them
together, how about--

00:19:07.315 --> 00:19:11.750
OK, stop making us pay $90
million for wasted gas.

00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:15.840
Let's use the $90 million
and fix the leaks,

00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:18.090
and then don't use
the money that we're

00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:20.810
going to build a pipeline
for and fix the leaks.

00:19:20.810 --> 00:19:23.830
So because this is all about
money at the end of the day.

00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:25.219
It's all anybody
cares about when

00:19:25.219 --> 00:19:27.746
you [INAUDIBLE] company,
either that or the people being

00:19:27.746 --> 00:19:30.896
mad at them in the public, which
ultimately is about the money

00:19:30.896 --> 00:19:32.320
issues as well.

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:35.804
So have you thought
about how you [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:35.804 --> 00:19:37.692
to put those together?

00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:42.800
AUDREY SCHULMAN:
One of the things--

00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:43.850
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:44.933
AUDREY SCHULMAN: Well, no.

00:19:44.933 --> 00:19:47.510
One of the things, I think,
that would be most effective

00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:51.500
is if the utilities had to pay
for the cost of the lost gas.

00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:54.140
If they did, as
soon as they did,

00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:57.770
I think we'd see a massive
amount of repair happening

00:19:57.770 --> 00:20:00.410
a hell of a lot faster.

00:20:00.410 --> 00:20:02.390
That that's what
happened in Texas.

00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:03.800
They passed a law saying that.

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:06.350
And within-- and I'm going
to get this wrong now--

00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:10.580
within three years, they
had 50% of the leaks fixed.

00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:13.965
So it's just incentives.

00:20:13.965 --> 00:20:15.340
NATHAN PHILLIPS:
What I heard was

00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:18.200
on the day that the
legislature, the end

00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:20.670
of the legislative session
last year, when the energy

00:20:20.670 --> 00:20:23.960
omnibus bill was finally passed
at-- whatever-- two o'clock

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:29.982
in the morning, I think
that's when the provision that

00:20:29.982 --> 00:20:34.110
would include the incentives,
the cost of the lost gas

00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:38.000
gets shipped into the
companies was gone.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.380
So there's a lot of
logging going on over who's

00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:44.176
paying for the lost gas.

00:20:44.176 --> 00:20:45.104
That's a problem.

00:20:45.104 --> 00:20:46.687
AUDIENCE: Well, but
what you're saying

00:20:46.687 --> 00:20:49.170
is that's the first
place to start, start

00:20:49.170 --> 00:20:53.530
by not taking the $90 million
and using it to fix the leaks,

00:20:53.530 --> 00:20:55.580
taking $90 million
and say ratepayers

00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:58.360
you keep it in your
pocket until the gas

00:20:58.360 --> 00:20:59.360
company's paying for it.

00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:02.247
But that's a really simple-- any
legislator can figure that out,

00:21:02.247 --> 00:21:04.330
or any member of the public
could figure that out.

00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:05.673
You make it really simple.

00:21:05.673 --> 00:21:07.881
NATHAN PHILLIPS: That was
the provision [INAUDIBLE]..

00:21:07.881 --> 00:21:08.354
AUDIENCE: Well, I know.

00:21:08.354 --> 00:21:10.960
But the public [INAUDIBLE]
in the middle of the night

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:12.355
is that the public is asleep.

00:21:12.355 --> 00:21:13.996
NATHAN PHILLIPS: Right, exactly.

00:21:13.996 --> 00:21:17.604
AUDIENCE: Just when
they emit the gas.

00:21:17.604 --> 00:21:19.480
AUDREY SCHULMAN: Yep.

00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:21.040
AUDIENCE: So with
the infrastructure

00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:26.780
being this old, I'm worried if
you fix the leaks in one spot,

00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:28.590
because it's
[INAUDIBLE] of pressure,

00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:32.380
then it will just create
leaks in other spots.

00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:37.600
So has there been any
study of what happens

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:39.222
when you fix leaks?

00:21:39.222 --> 00:21:41.480
NATHAN PHILLIPS: Do
you want to take it?

00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:43.350
AUDREY SCHULMAN:
We both can answer.

00:21:43.350 --> 00:21:44.610
NATHAN PHILLIPS: You go first.

00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:46.350
AUDREY SCHULMAN: I
think a lot in Boston,

00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:47.766
a lot of the
pressure in the pipes

00:21:47.766 --> 00:21:49.700
is about half pound
per square inch.

00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:53.580
So fixing a leak in
one spot is really not

00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:56.190
going to make any
discernible difference.

00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:59.217
And the pressure's supposed
to be maintained evenly

00:21:59.217 --> 00:22:01.800
across the system, otherwise the
people at the end of the line

00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:03.008
would not be getting any gas.

00:22:03.008 --> 00:22:07.140
So there is the question that
hammering into the ground

00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:08.820
and moving stuff
could potentially

00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:10.560
displace a little bit of--

00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:13.440
move the joint of
the pipe a teeny bit,

00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:15.649
although I wonder if
that's actually true.

00:22:15.649 --> 00:22:16.190
Your thought?

00:22:16.190 --> 00:22:17.106
NATHAN PHILLIPS: Yeah.

00:22:17.106 --> 00:22:18.750
It's a pressure-regulated
system.

00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:20.460
So if you patch a
leak, they're just

00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:23.550
going to turn down the
flow to maintain the-- so

00:22:23.550 --> 00:22:26.200
it's not going to induce a
higher leak rate elsewhere.

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:29.460
But it is a Band-Aid
solution to patch,

00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:33.690
because every 12 feet on a
cast iron pipe is a joint.

00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:36.110
And you often have
a series of leaks,

00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:38.970
so then you're
facing the question,

00:22:38.970 --> 00:22:43.320
do you repair or replace?

00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:45.570
And there's a whole other
set of considerations

00:22:45.570 --> 00:22:46.860
in terms of money.

00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:48.620
Cost.

00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:52.560
And I'm still very ambivalent
about whether we should triage

00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:55.170
the system that we
have as we transition

00:22:55.170 --> 00:22:57.480
to electrifying
our heating system

00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:00.420
and making the transition
to a clean energy--

00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:03.510
a non-fossil energy--
or do we actually

00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:07.860
invest in replacing pipes
that are going to be down

00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:10.680
for another 30, 40, 50 years?

00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:13.545
So, it's a tough call.

00:23:13.545 --> 00:23:15.200
AUDIENCE: Is the technology--

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:17.670
are they discussing technology
and the composition of pipes

00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:20.910
that would be more long-term
and less susceptible to--

00:23:20.910 --> 00:23:22.140
NATHAN PHILLIPS: Not really.

00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:24.860
Plastic is what's
being put down now.

00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:28.810
And it's not leaking
because it's new.

00:23:28.810 --> 00:23:31.860
They don't really
know, as far as I know,

00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:35.430
how acids in the soil
and weathering and all

00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:39.330
of these kinds of things-- what
the influence on the plastic

00:23:39.330 --> 00:23:40.470
will be.

00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:44.190
There's nothing inherently
wrong with cast iron pipe,

00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:45.020
except it's old.

00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:47.520
If it was new cast-iron pie--

00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:49.590
of course, that's more
energy intensive to make--

00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:53.736
but it's really just
the age factor, I think.

00:23:53.736 --> 00:23:55.610
AUDREY SCHULMAN: Although
I just want to say,

00:23:55.610 --> 00:23:57.410
I keep thinking
dentists can come up

00:23:57.410 --> 00:23:59.480
with stuff that
can fix teeth that

00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:05.390
are in saliva and acidic stuff
and under incredible pressure

00:24:05.390 --> 00:24:06.230
and stuff like that.

00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:07.896
Why can't anybody
come up with something

00:24:07.896 --> 00:24:10.820
that we could just coat
the pipes on the inside?

00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:15.475
So, you know, go ahead.

00:24:15.475 --> 00:24:20.002
AUDIENCE: I was curious
how broad a number

00:24:20.002 --> 00:24:22.457
of the people who have been
doing this sort of work, you

00:24:22.457 --> 00:24:26.385
might have across the country--
other cities around the world--

00:24:26.385 --> 00:24:27.858
are you in touch with folks?

00:24:31.295 --> 00:24:33.040
AUDREY SCHULMAN:
Mostly Massachusetts.

00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:34.540
NATHAN PHILLIPS:
You know, the study

00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:39.120
we did in Boston was the first
study of its kind in the world.

00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:43.700
So things started bubbling out
from here, literally I guess.

00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:46.980
But I think there's
been a very strong what

00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:48.480
we call the gas leak's allies.

00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:51.300
The working group that we have
that meets-- is it once a month

00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:52.080
or once a week?

00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:52.990
AUDREY SCHULMAN: Twice a month.

00:24:52.990 --> 00:24:54.350
NATHAN PHILLIPS: Twice a month.

00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:55.540
This core group.

00:24:55.540 --> 00:24:58.200
And Mothers Out Front
has been amazing

00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:02.060
in terms of, essentially,
keeping that and growing

00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:04.139
that network.

00:25:04.139 --> 00:25:06.680
You know, you're seeing research
communities and other people

00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:10.470
in the science community doing
this work in other locations.

00:25:10.470 --> 00:25:15.102
I haven't quite seen the network
expand the way it has here,

00:25:15.102 --> 00:25:16.810
but the other interesting
thing, I think,

00:25:16.810 --> 00:25:18.720
is that we're also
realizing that there's

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:21.560
this urban to rural
interdependency.

00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:25.680
And so the pipeline issues
connect us with, you know,

00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:27.480
rural Western Massachusetts.

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:32.640
And the Kinder Morgan proposed
pipeline going in there.

00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:35.790
The pipeline that
connects us, in Boston,

00:25:35.790 --> 00:25:39.550
to New York, New
Jersey, Connecticut.

00:25:39.550 --> 00:25:41.750
The Algonquin
Incremental Market.

00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:43.140
The Spectra pipelines.

00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:47.580
That we are connected across
the rural and urban communities

00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:49.810
by the same infrastructure.

00:25:49.810 --> 00:25:55.470
So I think that the fossil
fuel infrastructure expansion

00:25:55.470 --> 00:26:00.930
physically starts to organize
a social network of resistance

00:26:00.930 --> 00:26:03.840
that is co-located with that.

00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:08.370
And that we're stronger
when we, as people, make

00:26:08.370 --> 00:26:11.790
the connections that are being
made physically, to resist it

00:26:11.790 --> 00:26:14.749
in a concerted fashion.

00:26:14.749 --> 00:26:16.790
AUDIENCE: One more just
quick technology, though.

00:26:16.790 --> 00:26:18.120
I read about it in
[INAUDIBLE] Apparently

00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:20.260
there's a new kind of
robot that they have.

00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:21.570
AUDREY SCHULMAN: The CISBOT?

00:26:21.570 --> 00:26:22.070
Yeah.

00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:25.500
AUDIENCE: That they can put into
the pipes-- that can fix leaks

00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:27.841
from inside the
pipe, without having

00:26:27.841 --> 00:26:30.270
to shut the gas line
down and without having

00:26:30.270 --> 00:26:31.700
to dig up the streets.

00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:35.940
But they are phenomenally
expensive robots, I guess.

00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:38.820
So that struck me
when I read about it

00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:41.200
as a significant ray
of hope that technology

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:44.569
could once again come to the
rescue here, so to speak.

00:26:44.569 --> 00:26:47.992
If we had more robots, then it
might not be so economically

00:26:47.992 --> 00:26:57.080
difficult for the utilities to
deal with the 20,000-odd leaks.

00:26:57.080 --> 00:26:58.160
AUDREY SCHULMAN: Yeah.

00:26:58.160 --> 00:26:59.585
Yeah.

00:26:59.585 --> 00:27:01.940
That robot-- they have
to dig down to put it in,

00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:03.420
and it only has a
limited expanse.

00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:07.710
So it needs so much improvement,
it's stunning to me.

00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:10.660
Maybe.

00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:11.820
AUDIENCE: I'm from Chile.

00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:14.778
I work for an oil
company in Chile.

00:27:14.778 --> 00:27:17.700
It's an operation
company, and they'll

00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:22.570
have pipelines in the city, but
only we extract oil and gas.

00:27:25.492 --> 00:27:30.690
We detect a lot of leaks
of methane in operations,

00:27:30.690 --> 00:27:32.130
and it's really,
really difficult

00:27:32.130 --> 00:27:35.296
to solve the problems.

00:27:35.296 --> 00:27:38.551
Sometimes you can
measure it in one corner,

00:27:38.551 --> 00:27:42.239
but the leak is two
blocks to the other side,

00:27:42.239 --> 00:27:43.892
because [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:43.892 --> 00:27:46.723
And from the
perspective of the oil

00:27:46.723 --> 00:27:52.570
and gas utility companies,
only the first--

00:27:52.570 --> 00:27:55.265
the priority is
for the explosion.

00:27:55.265 --> 00:27:56.640
AUDREY SCHULMAN:
Yeah, of course.

00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:58.020
AUDIENCE: This is the problem.

00:27:58.020 --> 00:28:04.190
I can say 2%, 4%, 5%.

00:28:04.190 --> 00:28:05.070
But that's OK.

00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:06.528
It's the effort to
do the business.

00:28:15.690 --> 00:28:19.420
When the general manager or
the manager of some assets

00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:23.096
know that he has a waste--

00:28:23.096 --> 00:28:25.774
structural waste in the area--

00:28:25.774 --> 00:28:28.580
he's really charged
with this [INAUDIBLE]..

00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:30.729
If you put this
information at an address,

00:28:30.729 --> 00:28:32.020
they are ready to move forward.

00:28:37.255 --> 00:28:38.171
NATHAN PHILLIPS: Yeah.

00:28:41.390 --> 00:28:44.670
AUDIENCE: Something
happened, because they know.

00:28:44.670 --> 00:28:53.540
Something happened, [INAUDIBLE]
I work for the oil company,

00:28:53.540 --> 00:28:56.590
but I know when you
have risk, [INAUDIBLE],,

00:28:56.590 --> 00:29:00.020
you need to take this
risk into account.

00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:03.372
[INAUDIBLE]

00:29:03.372 --> 00:29:05.080
NATHAN PHILLIPS: I
would agree with that.

00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:07.960
You know, there's a nexus of
issues associated with the gas

00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:12.560
leaks at the local
scale, explosion risks,

00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:14.450
risks to vegetation and trees--

00:29:14.450 --> 00:29:15.700
that's local.

00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:18.410
Air quality degradation is
more of a regional thing.

00:29:18.410 --> 00:29:21.580
And then there's
the global issue.

00:29:21.580 --> 00:29:25.810
And they're all issues, and
they should all be considered.

00:29:25.810 --> 00:29:29.130
Because after our
Boston study, I

00:29:29.130 --> 00:29:34.000
remember that I was on
Greater Boston, the TV show.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:39.460
And the co-panelist
was the Secretary

00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:42.036
of Energy and Environment
for Massachusetts.

00:29:42.036 --> 00:29:44.920
And he said, thank you
for the work you're doing,

00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:50.470
because you're giving me
a way to make this issue.

00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:52.560
You know, because
the explosion issue

00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:57.700
allowed him to push forward the
climate change part of this.

00:29:57.700 --> 00:30:00.246
So, yeah, that's consistent
with what you're saying.

00:30:00.246 --> 00:30:10.658
AUDIENCE: When you
[INAUDIBLE] have you ever

00:30:10.658 --> 00:30:13.750
been talked to by
somebody walking along?

00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:15.216
NATHAN PHILLIPS: All the time.

00:30:15.216 --> 00:30:19.240
AUDIENCE: So, why is the
situation definitely like this?

00:30:23.054 --> 00:30:24.470
NATHAN PHILLIPS:
Well, he's been--

00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:31.090
Bob Ackley has been a lone
voice for the last 30 years

00:30:31.090 --> 00:30:34.870
who has been struggling
to be not just

00:30:34.870 --> 00:30:38.930
the only person who has
been calling this issue out.

00:30:38.930 --> 00:30:43.768
And I think he feels--

00:30:43.768 --> 00:30:46.060
I don't want to
speak for him, but--

00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:49.030
when people started
to join with him,

00:30:49.030 --> 00:30:50.707
that's when I think
he started to feel

00:30:50.707 --> 00:30:51.790
some level of vindication.

00:30:51.790 --> 00:30:54.220
That it's not just me.

00:30:56.740 --> 00:31:03.250
So as this network has grown
larger, I think the changes--

00:31:03.250 --> 00:31:06.550
the policy changes are happening
because it's just everyone

00:31:06.550 --> 00:31:08.900
seeing that this is a problem.

00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:11.510
He's been struggling
on his own for--

00:31:11.510 --> 00:31:14.850
he worked for the gas
companies to do leak surveys.

00:31:14.850 --> 00:31:19.480
So for much of his
career, he was basically

00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:21.310
a worker for the gas company.

00:31:21.310 --> 00:31:22.560
Here's the leak reports.

00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:24.340
Here are the gas leaks.

00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:26.850
And he would notice
trees were dying,

00:31:26.850 --> 00:31:30.610
and that the gas companies
were not taking that seriously.

00:31:30.610 --> 00:31:32.952
They're like, well, we're not
going to worry about that.

00:31:32.952 --> 00:31:34.160
And that really bothered him.

00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:38.890
So at some point, he defected
and went out on his own

00:31:38.890 --> 00:31:42.730
because the trees were-- he
felt like his work wasn't

00:31:42.730 --> 00:31:48.460
being taken seriously, and
so he struck out on his own.

00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:52.420
It's one person and these
massive investor-owned

00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:59.476
utilities that has
made it very difficult.

00:31:59.476 --> 00:32:01.770
AUDIENCE: I saw your latest.

00:32:01.770 --> 00:32:03.640
You tweeted it.

00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:04.536
In Dedham?

00:32:04.536 --> 00:32:06.102
NATHAN PHILLIPS: Yeah.

00:32:06.102 --> 00:32:07.445
AUDIENCE: Is that a new line?

00:32:07.445 --> 00:32:08.320
NATHAN PHILLIPS: Yes.

00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:11.165
Yes, that's the West
Roxbury lateral pipeline.

00:32:11.165 --> 00:32:13.330
AUDIENCE: And now it leaks?

00:32:13.330 --> 00:32:17.590
NATHAN PHILLIPS: Yeah, so
I'm going to just show it.

00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:19.270
So we went out on Monday.

00:32:19.270 --> 00:32:19.830
A while back.

00:32:19.830 --> 00:32:23.640
Me and myself and my son.

00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:25.030
So you see these spikes.

00:32:25.030 --> 00:32:26.210
Something like this, right?

00:32:26.210 --> 00:32:28.306
You see the red spikes.

00:32:28.306 --> 00:32:31.420
And this is on a stretch of--

00:32:31.420 --> 00:32:34.120
it's East Street in Dedham.

00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:38.060
Very close to Dedham center,
right by where the Boston

00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:41.650
and Providence turnpike--

00:32:41.650 --> 00:32:46.120
whatever it's called--
fast-moving thing.

00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:49.310
That stretch of East Street,
which is about an eighth

00:32:49.310 --> 00:32:53.240
of a mile, is part of the
pathway of the new West Roxbury

00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:58.940
lateral pipeline, which is a
750 pounds per square inch,

00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:01.930
two-foot diameter
transmission pipeline

00:33:01.930 --> 00:33:06.020
spur that has been
part of Spectra Energy.

00:33:06.020 --> 00:33:09.550
It's their project to increase
the gas flow into Boston.

00:33:09.550 --> 00:33:13.570
And what's really disturbing
about what we found on Monday

00:33:13.570 --> 00:33:16.270
is that this is where,
in the last year,

00:33:16.270 --> 00:33:21.780
they've trenched that entire
roadway and put this new pipe.

00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:28.232
Then they covered it up, paved
new paving, new sidewalks,

00:33:28.232 --> 00:33:30.620
but they left
leaking pipelines--

00:33:30.620 --> 00:33:32.730
the low-pressure
distribution pipelines--

00:33:32.730 --> 00:33:34.480
they left them
leaking, and that's

00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:38.560
where there's all of these
leaks, one after the other.

00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:41.210
And so it was a
missed opportunity.

00:33:41.210 --> 00:33:43.240
If you're going to
dig up the street,

00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:46.660
don't leave hundred-year-old
leaking pipelines there.

00:33:46.660 --> 00:33:47.560
Fix it.

00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:51.670
There's already patches,
now, in this new pavement,

00:33:51.670 --> 00:33:54.383
which are going to mean
potholes are going to form soon.

00:33:54.383 --> 00:33:56.091
AUDIENCE: Are these
leaks the spokes that

00:33:56.091 --> 00:33:57.299
run off of the main pipeline?

00:34:01.474 --> 00:34:03.390
NATHAN PHILLIPS: They're
the old distribution,

00:34:03.390 --> 00:34:05.590
low-pressure pipelines,
that should've

00:34:05.590 --> 00:34:08.219
been fixed at the same time that
they put the new pipeline in.

00:34:12.325 --> 00:34:13.449
AUDIENCE: So two questions.

00:34:13.449 --> 00:34:16.710
One, what's the name
of the instrument?

00:34:16.710 --> 00:34:19.219
Are we going to
learn more about it?

00:34:19.219 --> 00:34:22.679
And then two, how does
the EPA rule [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:22.679 --> 00:34:23.679
impact any of this work?

00:34:28.630 --> 00:34:29.980
NATHAN PHILLIPS: OK.

00:34:29.980 --> 00:34:33.337
Yes, you get to go on the 31st.

00:34:33.337 --> 00:34:34.670
AUDIENCE: I'm out of town, darn!

00:34:34.670 --> 00:34:36.628
NATHAN PHILLIPS: Well,
we can arrange something

00:34:36.628 --> 00:34:38.020
on another occasion, I'm sure.

00:34:38.020 --> 00:34:40.750
But we get in the van, you
can see that the picture

00:34:40.750 --> 00:34:42.909
that Audrey showed--

00:34:42.909 --> 00:34:47.065
it's called a cavity
ring-down spectrometer.

00:34:47.065 --> 00:34:49.380
That's the technology.

00:34:49.380 --> 00:34:51.830
It's a laser technology.

00:34:51.830 --> 00:34:55.630
It has a little chamber in
it that is evacuated down

00:34:55.630 --> 00:34:59.291
to about one fifth of a whole
vacuum, so it's got about 20%

00:34:59.291 --> 00:35:02.334
of the air molecules that
normal air would have in it.

00:35:02.334 --> 00:35:03.750
So it's pulled
down to that level.

00:35:03.750 --> 00:35:05.990
It's about a one-liter chamber.

00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:08.800
And in that chamber,
there are three mirrors

00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:10.430
that are pointed at each other.

00:35:10.430 --> 00:35:13.040
And then they pulse
a laser into that

00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:19.178
that is tuned to the unique
absorbance span for methane.

00:35:19.178 --> 00:35:24.370
And that pulse of laser bounces
around the three mirrors.

00:35:24.370 --> 00:35:25.830
That's called ringing down.

00:35:25.830 --> 00:35:28.300
It's ringing in that
thing and bouncing around.

00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:32.460
And the more concentration of
methane there is in that air,

00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:36.850
the faster that pulse will decay
to zero, because the molecules

00:35:36.850 --> 00:35:39.214
of methane are absorbing.

00:35:39.214 --> 00:35:40.630
So if there's no
methane in there,

00:35:40.630 --> 00:35:43.010
it'll take a long time
for that thing to decay--

00:35:43.010 --> 00:35:44.700
that light pulse.

00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:47.772
So that's the basic method
for the cavity ring-down

00:35:47.772 --> 00:35:48.730
spectrometer.

00:35:48.730 --> 00:35:52.105
AUDIENCE: Did you build
that, or [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:52.105 --> 00:35:53.870
NATHAN PHILLIPS:
The manufacturer

00:35:53.870 --> 00:35:56.670
for the instrument we
use is called Picarro,

00:35:56.670 --> 00:35:58.880
and they're based
in Santa Clara.

00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:03.360
The technology and the
patents were mostly

00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:06.515
from Stanford
University scientists.

00:36:06.515 --> 00:36:09.740
There's another firm that's
doing the same basic kind

00:36:09.740 --> 00:36:14.480
of technology called Los Gatos
out in that area of California

00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:16.390
as well.

00:36:16.390 --> 00:36:20.827
There's a few different
flavors of this kind of method.

00:36:20.827 --> 00:36:23.160
AUDIENCE: So do you think
that there's-- because this is

00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:25.820
an expensive instrument.

00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:27.002
How much does it cost?

00:36:27.002 --> 00:36:28.710
NATHAN PHILLIPS: This
one was about $60k.

00:36:31.380 --> 00:36:33.990
AUDIENCE: So I'm thinking
more in the community science

00:36:33.990 --> 00:36:36.230
direction.

00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:40.440
I think cheap lasers are
becoming real, right?

00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:42.330
While maybe the
mirror configuration

00:36:42.330 --> 00:36:45.830
might be the
expensive piece there,

00:36:45.830 --> 00:36:51.330
is there a way to combine the
pulse lasers and, using data,

00:36:51.330 --> 00:36:54.054
and other techniques to
get more cheap results?

00:36:54.054 --> 00:36:54.970
NATHAN PHILLIPS: Well.

00:36:54.970 --> 00:36:55.830
Do you want to answer?

00:36:55.830 --> 00:36:56.886
I'm doing all the talking.

00:36:56.886 --> 00:36:57.969
AUDREY SCHULMAN: Go ahead.

00:36:57.969 --> 00:36:58.490
I'm happy.

00:36:58.490 --> 00:37:00.906
NATHAN PHILLIPS: I'll just say
that I'm going to come back

00:37:00.906 --> 00:37:03.430
to some comment there.

00:37:03.430 --> 00:37:06.930
MIT, the people here?

00:37:06.930 --> 00:37:07.885
The robot thing?

00:37:07.885 --> 00:37:11.330
Yeah, we could have swarms
of little tiny robots fixing

00:37:11.330 --> 00:37:13.770
pipelines, and MIT
is a great community

00:37:13.770 --> 00:37:15.990
to come up with those
types of solutions.

00:37:15.990 --> 00:37:22.040
And then, as well, low-cost
sensors that could do this

00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:27.493
would unlock opportunities for
a much wider group of people

00:37:27.493 --> 00:37:28.920
to be doing this stuff.

00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:29.550
AUDREY SCHULMAN:
And I don't think

00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:30.758
they'll have to be expensive.

00:37:30.758 --> 00:37:32.610
Like there's this
one technology where

00:37:32.610 --> 00:37:35.247
it's just something that
goes on the pipe seal,

00:37:35.247 --> 00:37:37.830
between the two joints, because
that's where most of the leaks

00:37:37.830 --> 00:37:38.640
come from.

00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:44.540
And if that link is broken,
it tells the office.

00:37:44.540 --> 00:37:46.650
That's simple.

00:37:46.650 --> 00:37:48.300
Let's do something
simple like that.

00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:49.230
That's not expensive.

00:37:49.230 --> 00:37:51.270
That's not hard.

00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:56.134
AUDIENCE: You can detect
the leaks in operations,

00:37:56.134 --> 00:37:58.084
we use infrared camera--

00:37:58.084 --> 00:37:59.000
AUDREY SCHULMAN: Yeah.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.291
AUDIENCE: You can see the
flows, you couldn't measure--

00:38:05.855 --> 00:38:06.813
NATHAN PHILLIPS: Right.

00:38:06.813 --> 00:38:09.524
AUDIENCE: Less flows, or more--

00:38:09.524 --> 00:38:10.440
NATHAN PHILLIPS: Yeah.

00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:11.430
More qualitative--

00:38:11.430 --> 00:38:21.210
AUDIENCE: But you
can see, [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:21.210 --> 00:38:25.200
AUDIENCE: Very briefly mentioned
that the town of Brookline

00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:30.670
has now passed two resolutions
opposing natural gas pipeline

00:38:30.670 --> 00:38:31.870
expansion in Massachusetts.

00:38:31.870 --> 00:38:36.380
We're the first community
to do such a thing where

00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:40.980
a pipeline was not scheduled to
go through in our boundaries.

00:38:40.980 --> 00:38:42.864
And we'd be happy to--

00:38:42.864 --> 00:38:45.930
Brookline town meeting-- to
look into the issue of somehow

00:38:45.930 --> 00:38:49.701
pressuring the gas
companies to more speedily

00:38:49.701 --> 00:38:53.180
address some issues
and leaks in our town.

00:38:53.180 --> 00:38:55.730
Kind of a general
pressure thing.

00:38:55.730 --> 00:38:56.840
[INAUDIBLE]

00:38:56.840 --> 00:38:57.973
AUDIENCE: I think that's
something that Mothers

00:38:57.973 --> 00:38:59.097
Out Front is already doing.

00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:05.840
AUDREY SCHULMAN:
And we want that.

00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:08.820
The more pressure they
have, the more everybody

00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:09.660
takes it seriously.

00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:10.980
As it should be.

00:39:10.980 --> 00:39:14.650
PROFESSOR: So, we have three
more sessions on the 23rd,

00:39:14.650 --> 00:39:16.740
which is the coming Monday.

00:39:16.740 --> 00:39:18.690
We have a hack-a-thon.

00:39:18.690 --> 00:39:23.987
and And again, we will be
playing with two different ways

00:39:23.987 --> 00:39:25.070
of hacking with this data.

00:39:25.070 --> 00:39:29.080
One is more data-centric,
more code-centric.

00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:32.460
The other might be more
design charette-centric.

00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:33.314
So--

00:39:33.314 --> 00:39:34.230
AUDIENCE: Visualizing.

00:39:34.230 --> 00:39:35.688
PROFESSOR: So
visualizing the data.

00:39:35.688 --> 00:39:38.040
Again, depending on
what your interests are,

00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:39.850
you can do one or the other.

00:39:39.850 --> 00:39:45.270
Do sign up on the CLIAP site,
if you haven't already done so.

00:39:45.270 --> 00:39:49.230
The next session, on the
31st is driving around town,

00:39:49.230 --> 00:39:52.110
and smelling.

00:39:52.110 --> 00:39:54.550
I think that's going to
be what we'll be doing.

00:39:54.550 --> 00:39:59.030
And finally, on the first,
we will come back together

00:39:59.030 --> 00:40:03.660
and say, what can communities
and citizens and scientists

00:40:03.660 --> 00:40:04.380
do with this?

00:40:04.380 --> 00:40:06.110
Can you take this to court?

00:40:06.110 --> 00:40:08.570
So, how do you
build an ecosystem

00:40:08.570 --> 00:40:10.510
that addresses these
challenges, and not

00:40:10.510 --> 00:40:13.710
just do it individually?
