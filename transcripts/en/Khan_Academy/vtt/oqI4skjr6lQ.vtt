00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500
 

00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.530
When we learned about antigen
presenting cells, we learned

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:06.130
that they can first digest
something-- let me draw a

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:09.700
dendritic cell right here--
my best version

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.450
of a dendritic cell.

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:13.120
Maybe I should draw them
simpler than that.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.990
A dendritic cell is a phagocyte
and it is an antigen

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:17.860
presenting cell.

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:22.630
So after phagocytoses some type
of a pathogen, it'll cut

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.550
it all up, and then it'll
display-- it'll present the

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:35.990
antigen on its surface on a
protein complex here and the

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:38.380
part of the pathogen that
it cut up, it'll

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.040
put up right here.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.000
And we learned on the antigen
presenting cell video that

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.570
this complex right here was an
MHC type II complex, where MHC

00:00:49.570 --> 00:01:02.750
stands for major
histocompatibility complex.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.800
Where histocompatibility just
means tissue compatibility.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.980
And this was the case on antigen
presenting cells.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:10.550
So even B cells did this.

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.390
Let me draw a B cell.

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.900
So a B cell-- it has
its membrane bound

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.770
antibody, just like that.

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.220
It actually has many, many
thousands of these.

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.130
I could keep drawing a bunch of
them, but just so you know

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:26.700
there's more than one.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.560
Maybe one of these get triggered
or get attached to

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.730
some type of virus or protein
or bacteria floating around.

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:41.340
And what it'll do is it'll take
this in and cut it up

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.760
again and do the same thing as
what the dendritic cell did.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:56.620
It'll cut up a part of this and
present it on its surface

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:01.170
in conjunction with
an MHC II complex.

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.320
So once again, this is
an MHC II complex.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.680
So these professional antigen
presenting cells that go out

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:13.460
and take things out of the
fluid, out of the humoral

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:17.190
parts of our body, things
just floating around.

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.860
They'll take them in, they'll
say, this is bad, cut them up,

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.770
and then present them
on these MHC II.

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.010
That's why we call them
professional antigen

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.480
presenting cells.

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:35.530
Now, it turns out that pretty
much all cells in our bodies--

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.070
when I say almost all
cells, it's actually

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:39.480
all nucleated cells.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.190
So all cells that have a nucleus
in the human body-- so

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.370
the only cells in our human body
that don't have nucleuses

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.600
are red blood cells, which I
find fascinating-- so that

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.310
they can have more space
for storing hemoglobin.

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.040
But all nucleated cells in our
bodies have another major

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:05.650
histocompatibility complex on it
and it's called an MHC I--

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.530
major histocompatibility
type I.

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.770
And just so you know, these
are also nucleated cells.

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:16.000
So they're also going to have an
MHC type I complex on them

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.240
right here.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:21.040
Now the interesting thing about
the MHC type I complex

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:30.950
is because it's on every cell in
our human body-- so pretty

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:36.010
much everything but the red
blood cells have an MHC I--

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.870
this is where if anything
wacky is going

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:39.910
on inside the cell.

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.260
Maybe the cell is cancerous and
producing crazy proteins.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.130
Maybe it's been infected
with a virus.

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.430
Maybe some type of bacteria or
some type of weird protein has

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.080
gotten in here-- any cell in the
human body can cut those

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.460
up, even if it's malfunctioning,
and it will

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:55.090
present them.

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:56.930
So let's say the cell
is cancerous.

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.350
So this cell's cancerous and
it has all these wacky

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.140
proteins that only cancer cells
present that is not

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.740
normal for a normal cell--
that will be

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:07.140
presented on the MHC I.

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:13.220
Let's say that I have some other
cell in my body that's a

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:14.095
different type of cell.

00:04:14.095 --> 00:04:15.370
It's nucleated.

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.865
Let's say it's been infected
with a virus.

00:04:18.865 --> 00:04:23.390
So it's turning into
this virus factory.

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:25.980
Same thing-- there are
mechanisms in a cell that will

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:30.230
take some of the proteins that
make up those viruses and

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:33.245
present them on the
MHC I complex.

00:04:33.245 --> 00:04:38.230
 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:42.250
So in the case of MHC II, this
is what triggered helper T

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.130
cells to say, hey,
you know what?

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.160
I found something floating
out here.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.930
Here's a little piece of
it, Mr. Helper T cell.

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.290
Why don't you bond to this and
raise the alarm system?

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:54.950
Now the MHC I system
says, this isn't

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:55.880
stuff floating around.

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:56.820
I've been infected.

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:57.850
I am cancerous.

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:58.950
I'm going nuts.

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:59.970
You better kill me.

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.280
I'm a virus, I'm a virus-making
machine.

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:03.370
You better kill me.

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:08.640
And that message goes to the
cytotoxic T cells and that's

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.710
really the topic
of this video.

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:12.920
So just to make sure
you understand the

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:14.250
difference-- so T cells.

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.390
They both have T cell receptors,
but the helper T

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:20.405
cells bond to MHC
II complexes.

00:05:20.405 --> 00:05:24.890
 

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:28.680
Let's say that this is a helper
T cell right here.

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:33.640
It would want to-- not all
helper T cells will.

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:36.470
Only the ones that have the
right combination, the right

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:39.960
variable portion right here that
just perfectly bonds to

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:44.060
this combination of an antigen
and the MHC II complex-- this

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:50.210
type of helper T cell will bond
here, get activated, and

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:51.120
start differentiating.

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.650
And the effector versions of
them will start raising the

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:56.230
alarms and the memory versions
of them will stick around in

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:58.550
case this type of thing
needs to happen again.

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:03.160
With MHC I, instead of
attracting a helper T cell, it

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:06.175
will attract a cytotoxic
T cell.

00:06:06.175 --> 00:06:10.450
 

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:14.930
So like helper T cells, the
T cell receptor has a

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:21.540
non-variable portion, but it
also has a variable portion

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:26.430
that is specific to this
combination of

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:28.300
antigens and MHC I.

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:34.400
So maybe this cytotoxic T cell
will be involved when this

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:35.995
cell goes cancerous.

00:06:35.995 --> 00:06:41.680
This cytotoxic T cell would be
of no use-- or it won't bond

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.530
to this one that was attracted
to a virus.

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:45.360
It's going to have to be
another cytotoxic T

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.720
cell that does that.

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:49.700
And the mechanism where we get
this variability in the helper

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:52.970
T cells or the cytotoxic T
cells or you saw in the B

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:56.360
cells on their membrane bound
antibodies, that all comes

00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:00.750
from when-- in their development
stage or in the

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:05.980
maturation process, the DNA that
codes for these variable

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:08.310
portions gets shuffled
around intentionally.

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:10.160
So normally, we're always
trying to preserve DNA

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.700
information, here it gets
shuffled around.

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:17.800
But anyway, once a cytotoxic T
cell finds one of these guys

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.630
on an MHC I-- remember, every
nucleated cell in the body has

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:25.080
an MHC I-- then what it does
is, it gets activated.

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:27.270
So let's say this guy says,
hey, that looks shady.

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:29.050
You need to die.

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:31.780
So this guy gets activated and
just like all other activated

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:33.986
cells, he starts to divide and
divide and divide and divide

00:07:33.986 --> 00:07:35.010
and differentiate.

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:37.930
And he divides and he
differentiates into memory,

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:41.420
just in case you're going to
need me again, just in case

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:43.580
this type of cancer
shows up again.

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:47.010
And then also into effector T
cells, which are the ones that

00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:48.260
do the killing.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.740
 

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:53.470
So this is an effector.

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:56.620
So let's say one of these
effectors-- they'll also bind

00:07:56.620 --> 00:08:00.030
to cancerous molecules,
cancerous cells,

00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:00.770
just like this one.

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:04.370
So let's say this cell has
split and there's another

00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:05.490
version of it right here.

00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:06.580
That's what cancer does.

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:08.880
It divides aggressively.

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:11.930
It's producing wacky proteins.

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:15.840
It presents the wacky proteins
on its MCH-- major

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:21.080
histocompatibility type I
complex-- it displays the

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:25.250
wacky proteins and then one of
these effector cytotoxic T

00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:32.250
cells will be attracted
to it just like that.

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:34.520
And I'm not going into details
on what necessarily does the

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:36.630
attractions and all the membrane
bound proteins.

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:38.250
If you take an immunology
class,

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:39.289
you'll see more on that.

00:08:39.289 --> 00:08:44.310
So this is a cytotoxic T cell
and it essentially forces this

00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:46.790
cell to kill itself in a couple
of different ways.

00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:53.610
One, it actually can exocytose
a bunch of proteins.

00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:59.230
They're call perforins-- that
make little holes in the

00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:01.090
membrane of the cell.

00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:04.770
And it has other proteins that
it releases called granzymes

00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:07.160
that go in here and essentially
start mechanisms

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:09.160
that make this cell want
to kill itself.

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:12.970
So the big picture is, if you
want to just take 20,000 feet,

00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:17.860
these cells are very effective
at produces-- so when a B cell

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:20.200
gets activated, it produces
antibodies that kill things

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:21.640
that are floating
around, right?

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:24.210
Once a B cell gets activated, it
starts producing a bunch of

00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:25.740
antibodies.

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:28.970
These antibodies float around
and then they can bond up to

00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:31.600
viruses, make them ineffective,
or essentially

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:34.680
tag them for pickup from
macrophages or dendritic

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:39.900
cells, or other types of
phagocytes-- while cytotoxic T

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:43.360
cells-- these are used to
essentially kill cells that

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:44.390
have gone awry.

00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:46.860
For example, a cancer cell
that's presenting weird

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:50.350
proteins or once the virus has
entered the cell, then the

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:51.850
antibodies are really
of no use.

00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:52.880
The antibodies aren't
going to be able to

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:54.450
get into those cells.

00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:57.270
In that case, instead of
cleaning up the virus itself,

00:09:57.270 --> 00:10:00.020
a cytotoxic T cell will come
here and just kill this cell

00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:02.300
because this cell is
a virus factory.

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:05.160
So you have to get it
out of the way.

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:05.938
