00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:11.299
The Man Who Fought in WWII With a Sword and
Bow

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:15.799
Running into battle armed with a broadsword,
bow, and quiver of arrows was perfectly acceptable

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:20.160
if you were fighting in the Hundred Years’
War or fending off some orcs on Middle Earth.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.070
But when it comes to World War II, such medieval
weaponry looks like child’s play next to

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:26.630
the technology of the time.

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.460
A sword isn’t the most likely of defences
against rifles and tanks.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:35.840
However, for John Malcolm Thorpe Fleming Churchill,
nicknamed “Mad Jack,” there was nothing

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.470
he’d rather arm himself with than a trusty
sword and bow.

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.900
Born into an old Oxfordshire family, he graduated
from the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.660
in 1926.

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.720
Before his World War II fame, Mad Jack worked
as an editor of a Nairobi newspaper, a model,

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.180
and a movie extra, appearing in The Thief
of Bagdad due to his expertise with a bow.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.590
That same talent with archery took him to
Oslo, Norway where he shot for Britain during

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.360
the world championships in 1939.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.080
By this time, of course, Europe was fast approaching
World War II.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.510
Mad Jack had left the army after ten years
of service, but happily returned to it because

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.550
of the “country having gotten into a jam
in my absence.”

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:17.580
By May 1940, Mad Jack was the second in command
of an infantry company.

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.350
He always marched into battle with a bow and
arrows and his trusty basket-hilted claymore

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.690
by his side.

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.440
Despite these weapons being wildly outdated,
Churchill defended them, saying, “In my

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.090
opinion…any officer who goes into action
without his sword is improperly dressed.”

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.950
His medieval weaponry wasn’t just for decoration,
either.

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:41.100
During the 1940 Battle of Dunkirk—in which
300,000 troops became stranded on beaches

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.490
and had to be evacuated—Churchill struck
down a German soldier with a well-placed arrow.

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.680
He was later seen chugging along on a motorcycle
with his bow strapped to the side.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.520
A German officer’s cap was hanging on the
headlight.

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:59.010
In 1941, Mad Jack volunteered for Operation
Archery, an attack on a German garrison in

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:03.280
Norway, in which he led two companies during
the battle; no word on whether or not he was

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.480
able to use his bow in the aptly named operation.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.420
In the battle, he and his companies were in
charge of taking out the German batteries

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:11.620
on Maaloy Island.

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.840
On the vessel bearing him to shore, Churchill
stood at the front playing his bagpipes to

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.540
the tune of “The March of the Cameron Men.”

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.419
When they landed, he charged ahead of the
rest of his men with his sword in hand.

00:02:22.419 --> 00:02:25.159
His sword also served him well later, in 1943.

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:30.719
At the time, Mad Jack was a commanding officer
in Salerno when his troops were forced into

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:33.790
line fighting—something for which they hadn’t
been trained.

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.319
Churchill went ahead of his soldiers wielding
his sword.

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:41.670
He leapt out at German sentries from the darkness,
blade held high, and the Germans were so frightened

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.249
by the “demon” that they surrendered.

00:02:44.249 --> 00:02:48.209
Churchill took 42 prisoners that night with
the help of just one other companion and his

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:49.590
trusty sword.

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.749
This was inline with his philosophy on fighting
the Germans, which he described after capturing

00:02:53.749 --> 00:02:54.749
the 42:

00:02:54.749 --> 00:02:58.140
I maintain that, as long as you tell a German
loudly and clearly what to do, if you are

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.239
senior to him he will cry ‘jawohl’ (yes
sir) and get on with it enthusiastically and

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.040
efficiently whatever the situation.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.609
Next, Churchill was sent off to Yugoslavia
where he led a series of raids against the

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:11.319
Germans from the island of Vis.

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:16.309
In May 1944, a bigger operation was planned
involving three attacks on separate hilltop

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:17.309
positions.

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:21.359
Mad Jack led one group up one hill, but only
six of them managed to reach the target.

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:25.650
Jack found himself in open view of the enemy
with only a few able-bodied men to defend

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.079
him, so he did what any sensible soldier would
have done… he played his bagpipes—“Will

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:35.299
Ye No Come Back Again” this time—until
he was knocked unconscious by German grenades

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:36.299
and captured.

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:40.519
Churchill was placed in Sachsenhausen concentration
camp after being interrogated.

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:44.420
The Germans had believed that he was some
sort of relative of Winston Churchill, which

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.659
wasn’t the case, but he was still considered
a “prominent” prisoner due to his rank.

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:51.519
As you might expect, Mad Jack wasn’t one
to be kept in a prison camp.

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:55.409
He made a run for it that September by sneaking
through an old drain under the barbed wire.

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:59.909
He and a comrade were recaptured not long
after and moved to a camp in Austria.

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:03.449
In April 1945, the Austrian camp’s lighting
system failed.

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:07.059
Churchill took advantage of the opportunity
and melted into the darkness, walking away

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:08.199
from his work detail.

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:12.680
He simply kept walking, and eight days and
150 miles later, he ran into the armoured

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.249
vehicles of the United States Army in Italy.

00:04:15.249 --> 00:04:19.060
He managed to convince them that he was a
British colonel despite his scruffy appearance,

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.640
and he was returned to safety.

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.780
Safety wasn’t exactly something Mad Jack
was after, though.

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.930
He was disappointed to learn that the war
was winding down and that he had missed a

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.140
year of it.

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:31.770
Rather than return home, he got himself assigned
to Burma where the war against Japan was still

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:32.850
in full swing.

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.520
By the time he got over there, though, the
bombs had been dropped on Nagasaki and Hiroshima,

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.530
meaning that the war was basically over.

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:41.460
An unhappy Churchill vented, “If it wasn’t
for those damn Yanks, we could have kept the

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.730
war going for another 10 years!”

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:46.520
The end of the war didn’t mean the end of
Churchill’s adventures, though.

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.770
He decided to train as a parachutist, and
when he qualified, he was sent into Palestine

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.180
as the second-in-command of the 1st Battalion.

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:57.690
He later became a land-air warfare instructor
in Australia, where he developed a love of

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:58.690
surfing.

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:06.490
He ended up retiring from the army in 1959
and died in 1996 in Surrey.

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:09.980
Mad Jack was known for throwing his briefcase
out of the train window.

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:10.980
His reasoning?

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:13.530
He was throwing it into his backyard, which
happened to be right by where the train rode

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:14.530
past.

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:30.610
This way, he didn’t have to lug it home
from the train station.
