00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500
so the pacing can flow better because
 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.170

the first hour to 90 minutes of this

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180
the first hour to 90 minutes of this
 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.750
the first hour to 90 minutes of this
film were pretty much a snail pace and

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760
film were pretty much a snail pace and
 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.339
film were pretty much a snail pace and
something no one's running around being

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:02.349
something no one's running around being

talking about that it's just it's not

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950
talking about that it's just it's not
 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.920
talking about that it's just it's not
terribly interesting for this first hour

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930
terribly interesting for this first hour
 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.659
terribly interesting for this first hour
to 90 minutes that's because the

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:09.669
to 90 minutes that's because the
 

00:03:09.669 --> 00:03:12.030
to 90 minutes that's because the
characters and the dialogue there wasn't

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040
characters and the dialogue there wasn't
 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.830
characters and the dialogue there wasn't
too much going on it was a lot of

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840
too much going on it was a lot of
 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.569
too much going on it was a lot of
exposition and for that reason I had a

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:15.579
exposition and for that reason I had a
 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:17.129
exposition and for that reason I had a
hard time getting into the first act of

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:17.139
hard time getting into the first act of
 

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:18.539
hard time getting into the first act of
this movie once these characters start

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:18.549
this movie once these characters start

this movie once these characters start
on their journey it does pick up a

00:03:20.369 --> 00:03:20.379
on their journey it does pick up a
 

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:22.140
on their journey it does pick up a
little bit but there are hitches along

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150
little bit but there are hitches along
 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.119

the way where certain scenes just don't

00:03:24.119 --> 00:03:24.129
the way where certain scenes just don't
 

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:26.129
the way where certain scenes just don't
feel like they need to be there and that

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:26.139
