00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:04.390
We ALL know the penis is a sensitive organ,
and yet there are many who choose cut off

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:14.470
a chunk of their kids' manhood -- but what
does this DO to 

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:15.560
the penis?

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:20.840
The practice of circumcision dates back thousands
of years, popping up in ancient cultures in

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:27.080
Asia, Africa, Australia and the Americas independently,
before any knew the other existed.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.410
It's practiced in Muslim, Christian and Jewish
populations.

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:36.270
Worldwide rates vary, but in the U.S. from
1980 to 1999, 65 percent of babies were cut,

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.559
and today, it's closer to 56 percent; rates
have been falling since 1960.

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.690
Nationally, three out of four babies getting
the procedure in the Midwest, two thirds in

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.530
the Northeast, a little over half in the south,
and only a fifth in the West!

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.280
Circumcision is the act of slicing the foreskin
off the penis.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.539
A natural penis has skin covering its head,
but a circumcised one does not.

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.179
A DiscoveryNews.com article describes the
foreskin as an "eyelid for the penis," which

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:06.570
is a weird analogy but they are similar in
that there’s a mucous membrane on the inside.

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.950
The adult foreskin is about 12 square inches,
of skin containing specialized nerve endings.

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.240
From a sexual standpoint, circumcision removes
one third of the erogenous tissue of the male

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.570
genetalia -- as the penis and clitoris come
from the same fetal tissue, the analogous

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.869
organ to the foreskin is the clitoral hood!

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:28.250
Obviously, there is a TON of debate as to
the real benefit of circumcision; and it doesn't

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.000
help that the policies keep shifting.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.840
In 1999, the American Academy of Pediatrics
issued a statement calling the practice into

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.600
question, saying the risks didn't outweigh
the benefits, but now a new compilation study

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.829
done by the Mayo Clinic claims the benefits
outweigh the risks 100 to 1!

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:48.600
According to their findings, over their lifetime
half of all men will require some kind of

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.509
foreskin-related medical attention; circumcision
reduces risks of "urinary tract infection,

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:58.530
prostate cancer, sexually transmitted diseases"
and the risk of cervical cancer is reduced

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.810
for the female partners of cut men.

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.280
In fact, the World Health Organization recommend
the procedure for any country attempting to

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.049
battle HIV infection.

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.990
Now you might be thinking, wait, the United
Nation's World Health Organization has a pruned

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.990
penis policy?

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.300
Yeah, it does.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.660
And a 2010 study from Plos ONE explains why…

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.080
See, the foreskin isn't just an extra bit
on the bits.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:27.030
Because the foreskin is a protective, mucous-membrane
layer, it also attracts bacteria -- actually,

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.030
according to the study, the foreskin has it's
own microbiome!

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.110
For the study, researchers from Johns Hopkins
Bloomberg School of Public Health looked under

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.390
the hood of uncircumcised penises, and found
anaerobic bacteria, those are bacteria which

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:40.560
live without oxygen.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:46.220
Studying Ugandan men before and after circumcision,
they discovered, that this previously unknown

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:53.690
anaerobic bacteria disappeared in the year
they were cut; forever altering the individual

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.270
microbiome of the male penis.

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:00.010
It is known from other studies that Langerhans
cells normally live under the foreskin as

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.980
well, and are commonly attacked by HIV, so
perhaps that's why HIV transmission is so

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.420
much lower with circumcised men?

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:08.850
They're still figuring this out.

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.620
In the end, the practice is ancient and fascinating,
but is it necessary?

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.280
Not at all, and there's still a roaring debate
about removing a third of the penile erogenous

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:31.540
tissue, issues of cleanliness, not to mention
possible side-effects the major trauma!
