00:00:57.824 --> 00:00:59.392
I'm the host, Ari Shaffir,

- I don't care for
the way people act...

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.813
these days,
most of the time.

00:01:19.813 --> 00:01:21.681
I don't like the way
people act.

00:01:21.681 --> 00:01:24.784
Uh, I find everybody to be
very entitled.

00:01:24.784 --> 00:01:26.752
Nobody apologizes anymore.

00:01:26.752 --> 00:01:28.353
Nobody says, "Sorry."

00:01:28.353 --> 00:01:29.922
Sorry isn't an apology anymore.

00:01:29.922 --> 00:01:32.524
Sorry has become
a sarcastic phrase.

00:01:32.524 --> 00:01:34.928
It's completely sarcastic now,
'cause everybody's entitled,

00:01:34.928 --> 00:01:39.532
you know,
"Sorry, I'm a bitch. Sorry."

00:01:39.532 --> 00:01:41.433
Deal, I'm a bitch."

00:01:41.433 --> 00:01:43.035
Well, you're a cunt,
actually.

00:01:43.035 --> 00:01:45.104
You're a cunt
and a horrible person.

00:01:45.104 --> 00:01:47.640
Uh, but that's everybody's
attitude.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.609
Like, "Deal, ugh--ugh--ugh"
and it bothers me.

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:54.013
And I will admit,
I am ethical to a fault

00:01:54.013 --> 00:01:55.481
because of the way
I was raised.

00:01:55.481 --> 00:01:58.852
Now, I was raised
in an East Coast,

00:01:58.852 --> 00:02:02.888
Italian,
Catholic household, okay?

00:02:02.888 --> 00:02:05.858
Now, I'm not Italian
'cause I'm adopted.

00:02:05.858 --> 00:02:09.061
Uh, and I'm not Catholic
because I'm logical.

00:02:09.061 --> 00:02:13.365
But I was raised
in that environment.

00:02:13.365 --> 00:02:14.867
And that environment makes you

00:02:14.867 --> 00:02:17.803
passionate to a fault
about your ethics, okay?

00:02:17.803 --> 00:02:19.972
This is the kind of Italian,
Catholic house I grew up in.

00:02:19.972 --> 00:02:23.175
When I was 12 years old,
my mother forced me

00:02:23.175 --> 00:02:25.911
to watch "Goodfellas."

00:02:25.911 --> 00:02:27.313
She for--I didn't
want to watch it.

00:02:27.313 --> 00:02:29.482
She made me
watch it.

00:02:29.482 --> 00:02:31.484
And the--there's a scene
in the movie

00:02:31.484 --> 00:02:32.852
where Henry Hill,
the main character,

00:02:32.852 --> 00:02:34.520
he gets
busted for the first time.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.656
And he beats the rap in court
'cause he won't squeal.

00:02:37.656 --> 00:02:40.059
And he leaves the courtroom and
goes out to the lobby,

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:42.261
and De Niro comes up to him.
And De Niro goes,

00:02:42.261 --> 00:02:43.897
[as Robert De Niro]
"You learned the two greatest

00:02:43.897 --> 00:02:47.666

never rat on your friends,

00:02:47.666 --> 00:02:51.270
and always, always
keep your mouth shut."

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:56.075
And at that part in the movie,
my mom paused the movie.

00:02:57.877 --> 00:03:00.346
And she turned to me
and she goes,

00:03:00.346 --> 00:03:03.015
"Did you hear that?

00:03:03.015 --> 00:03:06.185
That's what
it's all about."

00:03:06.185 --> 00:03:08.688
Mm, well, he committed
perjury, actually,

00:03:08.688 --> 00:03:11.691
if you want to get down
to what it's all about.

00:03:11.691 --> 00:03:15.061
Uh, crazy,
passionate household.

00:03:15.061 --> 00:03:16.396
Emotional.

00:03:16.396 --> 00:03:18.397
Very emotional.

00:03:18.397 --> 00:03:21.534
Fights with zero filter.

00:03:21.534 --> 00:03:25.038
Just unbridled rage
in every argument.

00:03:25.038 --> 00:03:27.073
I've--I've gotten
so mad at my mom

00:03:27.073 --> 00:03:28.974
in the middle of arguments,
where we're screaming,

00:03:28.974 --> 00:03:31.110
that I'll--I would stop
and I would go,

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:36.749
"Ooh, what I wouldn't give,
just one time."

00:03:36.749 --> 00:03:38.885
And my mom
wouldn't even get offended.

00:03:38.885 --> 00:03:40.953
She wouldn't be like,
"How dare you," you know?

00:03:40.953 --> 00:03:43.655
My mom would go,
"You and what army?"

00:03:43.655 --> 00:03:49.061
That was her response to it.
It's psychotic.

00:03:49.061 --> 00:03:51.130
And it was a Catholic household,
as I said too.

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.399
Very Catholic, um,
how Catholic?

00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:54.767
This is how Catholic.

00:03:54.767 --> 00:03:59.572
Uh, there was a framed
cross-stitch work of art

00:03:59.572 --> 00:04:02.508
above the couch
in the living room,

00:04:02.508 --> 00:04:05.244
uh, and it was a poem--
a Catholic poem,

00:04:05.244 --> 00:04:07.847
and it said,
"A little boy asked Jesus,

00:04:07.847 --> 00:04:10.649
"'Jesus,
how much do you love me?'

00:04:10.649 --> 00:04:13.585
"And Jesus said,
'This much.'

00:04:13.585 --> 00:04:17.323
And stretched his arms out
and died."

00:04:17.323 --> 00:04:20.760
[laughter]

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.964
That was above the couch,
in the room

00:04:24.964 --> 00:04:27.700
where you're supposed to
have tea with people.

00:04:29.702 --> 00:04:32.705
We also had a statue, uh,
when you walked in

00:04:32.705 --> 00:04:34.973
the front door, there was
a statue about this big.

00:04:34.973 --> 00:04:36.942
There was a little table and
a statue on it about that big.

00:04:36.942 --> 00:04:41.314
It was a bust of bloody Christ
from the crucifixion.

00:04:41.314 --> 00:04:42.814
That was
the first thing you saw

00:04:42.814 --> 00:04:45.184
when you walked into the house.

00:04:45.184 --> 00:04:46.952
Like, "Ah, am I gonna like
this place?

00:04:46.952 --> 00:04:49.655
"Oh, there's a dying Jesus
with blood and snot

00:04:49.655 --> 00:04:52.291
all over his face, okay,
yeah, I feel welcome."

00:04:52.291 --> 00:04:53.793
It was terrifying.

00:04:53.793 --> 00:04:55.694
But my--I swear to God--
my best friend was Jewish,

00:04:55.694 --> 00:04:57.163
so I would chase him
around the house

00:04:57.163 --> 00:05:00.632
with the statue all the time
when he slept over.

00:05:00.632 --> 00:05:03.836
"Look what you did
to me, Dan.

00:05:03.836 --> 00:05:07.907
[spooky voice]
Look what you did, Jew!"

00:05:10.676 --> 00:05:12.478
All right,
so that's the house.

00:05:12.478 --> 00:05:14.680
That's the house,
and that's how I was raised.

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:19.151
Okay, so, uh,
about three or four years ago,

00:05:19.151 --> 00:05:20.820
my mom got cancer.

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.155
Now, she's okay now,
she's fine,

00:05:23.155 --> 00:05:25.558
but she had to go
through a recovery period

00:05:25.558 --> 00:05:27.860
for a few months,
so I moved home

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.996
to try to help her
through the recovery period.

00:05:29.996 --> 00:05:33.032
And one of the biggest rules
about cancer recovery is:

00:05:33.032 --> 00:05:36.102
no stress.
You can't stress.

00:05:36.102 --> 00:05:39.005
Which is gonna be tough because
this is a woman

00:05:39.005 --> 00:05:42.508
that I've almost fist-fought
several times in my life.

00:05:42.508 --> 00:05:45.010
So I'm just, you know,
we're cooped up in the house

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:46.745
and we're annoying the shit
out of each other,

00:05:46.745 --> 00:05:48.014
but we're trying not to fight.

00:05:48.014 --> 00:05:49.448
We're just trying
to keep it cool.

00:05:49.448 --> 00:05:51.183
And the tension's building,
and whatever.

00:05:51.183 --> 00:05:53.219
Then, finally, one day,
my mom goes,

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:54.953
"I feel good today,
let's leave--

00:05:54.953 --> 00:05:56.455
"let's go out of the house
for the first time.

00:05:56.455 --> 00:05:58.390
"Let's go out of the house.
It's Sunday.

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:02.428
Let's go to the supermarket.
We'll make a big Sunday gravy."

00:06:02.428 --> 00:06:03.863
Italian tradition, great.

00:06:03.863 --> 00:06:06.265
We go to the supermarket
on a Sunday in the suburbs,

00:06:06.265 --> 00:06:09.801
which, if you've ever done that,
it's a fucking nightmare, okay?

00:06:09.801 --> 00:06:11.570
It's horrible,
there's cars everywhere,

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:14.039
there's loose carts
flying all over the place.

00:06:14.039 --> 00:06:15.541
There's kids.
It's fucking terrible.

00:06:15.541 --> 00:06:18.711
So I'm already driving like,
"Oh, motherfucker.

00:06:18.711 --> 00:06:20.279
We're not gonna get
a parking spot."

00:06:20.279 --> 00:06:22.081
And I'm getting aggravated
but I'm like, "Be cool,

00:06:22.081 --> 00:06:24.416
"'cause your--don't give
your mom cancer, again,

00:06:24.416 --> 00:06:27.587
just be cool right now."

00:06:27.587 --> 00:06:31.991
And there's a big, douchey,
like, SUV in front of us.

00:06:31.991 --> 00:06:34.827
And, uh, it suddenly
just stops.

00:06:34.827 --> 00:06:37.129
Doesn't pull over to the side,
it just stops

00:06:37.129 --> 00:06:39.932
in the middle
of the driving lane.

00:06:39.932 --> 00:06:41.967
And the car shuts off,

00:06:41.967 --> 00:06:44.904
and the driver
gets out of the car,

00:06:44.904 --> 00:06:48.274
and walks
into the supermarket.

00:06:48.274 --> 00:06:50.609
That's it,
doesn't put his flashers on.

00:06:50.609 --> 00:06:53.078
Doesn't go like,
"Oh, shit, dude, I'm sorry,

00:06:53.078 --> 00:06:54.980
I'll be right back."
Nothing!

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:56.983
Just walk--
you ever see somebody

00:06:56.983 --> 00:06:59.418
do an asshole-dickhead thing
like that,

00:06:59.418 --> 00:07:01.153
and they don't
call attention to the fact

00:07:01.153 --> 00:07:02.988
that they did an
asshole-dickhead thing?

00:07:02.988 --> 00:07:04.489
It's like you just
saw a magic trick.

00:07:04.489 --> 00:07:07.092
You're like,
"What the fuck just happened?

00:07:07.092 --> 00:07:08.828
"Did he just do that?
He did that.

00:07:08.828 --> 00:07:12.531
Wait, how did he do that?
But he did that?"

00:07:12.531 --> 00:07:14.200
So I start honking.

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:17.436
I start honking and I'm yelling
even though the windows are up.

00:07:17.436 --> 00:07:21.039
I'm yelling,
and I go, "Yeah! Hey!

00:07:21.039 --> 00:07:23.609
You can't park here!
Hey!"

00:07:23.609 --> 00:07:26.778
And my mom goes, "Stop it.
Stop honking right now."

00:07:26.778 --> 00:07:29.115
And I go, "No, I won't stop it.
He shouldn't be parked--

00:07:29.115 --> 00:07:30.550
"You can't do--did you see
what he just did?

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:32.051
Hey!
Hey!"

00:07:32.051 --> 00:07:33.452
And my mom goes, "Stop it.
You're embarrassing me."

00:07:33.452 --> 00:07:34.986
'Cause now we're out
of the house

00:07:34.986 --> 00:07:40.326
and suddenly she has class,
all of a sudden.

00:07:40.326 --> 00:07:42.194
And my mom goes,
"Stop it! Stop it!"

00:07:42.194 --> 00:07:46.298
And I go, "I will not stop it!
There are rules, Mom!

00:07:46.298 --> 00:07:49.134
Am I the only one that
gives a shit about the rules?"

00:07:49.134 --> 00:07:51.637
And I literally start doing the
John Goodman speech

00:07:51.637 --> 00:07:54.140
from "The Big Lebowski"

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:58.144
when he's in the bowling alley
with the gun.

00:07:58.144 --> 00:08:00.645
And when you do that speech
to people, they don't go,

00:08:00.645 --> 00:08:03.148
"Oh, 'Big Lebowski,'
right?"

00:08:03.148 --> 00:08:07.420
They go, "What the fuck
is wrong with you?"

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:10.990
So I--we--we have to pull
around his truck now,

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:13.392
into the oncoming traffic
lane.

00:08:13.392 --> 00:08:15.928
And it's dangerous
and whatever,

00:08:15.928 --> 00:08:18.164
but we maneuver around
and we park.

00:08:18.164 --> 00:08:19.665
And I'm very angry.

00:08:19.665 --> 00:08:22.034
And my--me and my parents,
we get out of the car

00:08:22.034 --> 00:08:23.269
and my mom and dad say,

00:08:23.269 --> 00:08:24.903
"Come on, let's go
into the store."

00:08:24.903 --> 00:08:28.674
And I pull a super
"Goodfellas" move right now.

00:08:28.674 --> 00:08:31.910
I just go,
"You go ahead.

00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:34.913
You go ahead,
I'm gonna wait right here."

00:08:34.913 --> 00:08:36.716
Because that happens
in "Goodfellas."

00:08:36.716 --> 00:08:39.185
There's a part in "Goodfellas"
where Ray Liotta's girlfriend

00:08:39.185 --> 00:08:42.855
gets sexually assaulted
by the neighbor, right?

00:08:42.855 --> 00:08:44.356
And he drives her home,
and then they see

00:08:44.356 --> 00:08:45.791
the neighbor outside,
and she goes,

00:08:45.791 --> 00:08:47.259
"Let's go in the house,
Henry."

00:08:47.259 --> 00:08:49.862
He goes, "No, no, no,
no, you, you go ahead.

00:08:49.862 --> 00:08:51.129
I'm gonna wait here."

00:08:51.129 --> 00:08:52.965
And then he walks
across the street

00:08:52.965 --> 00:08:56.902
and beats the neighbor's
face in with his gun.

00:08:56.902 --> 00:09:00.539
And I've wanted
to do that so bad

00:09:00.539 --> 00:09:05.544
in front of a girl for my
entire fucking life.

00:09:05.544 --> 00:09:08.046
Could you imagine...

00:09:08.046 --> 00:09:10.049
Do--do you have a boyfriend?

00:09:10.049 --> 00:09:13.986
Uh, you love him?
You like him?

00:09:13.986 --> 00:09:15.587
- I like him.

00:09:15.587 --> 00:09:18.157
- Just imagine if he beat
a man's face in

00:09:18.157 --> 00:09:19.558
with a gun in front of you--

00:09:19.558 --> 00:09:21.894
No, you wouldn't be
making that face.

00:09:21.894 --> 00:09:23.229
You wouldn't be making
this face,

00:09:23.229 --> 00:09:25.664
you'd be making,
[moans] this face.

00:09:25.664 --> 00:09:28.934
You'd be the horniest
you've ever been

00:09:28.934 --> 00:09:32.505
in your fucking life.

00:09:32.505 --> 00:09:34.773
It's awesome!

00:09:34.773 --> 00:09:36.508
Anyway.

00:09:36.508 --> 00:09:40.680
So I go, "You go ahead, I'm
gonna--gonna wait right here."

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:42.647
And they go in the supermarket
and I stand there,

00:09:42.647 --> 00:09:44.083
and I just wait
for the guy.

00:09:44.083 --> 00:09:46.519
And he comes strolling out
of the supermarket

00:09:46.519 --> 00:09:48.186
with a six-pack.

00:09:48.186 --> 00:09:51.023
This fucking douche bag
wasn't even going in

00:09:51.023 --> 00:09:53.425
to get like medicine,
or some shit like that.

00:09:53.425 --> 00:09:56.295
Like an emergency, possibly,
no--six-pack.

00:09:56.295 --> 00:09:58.964
And he's smiling
like he's proud of what he did.

00:09:58.964 --> 00:10:00.366
And he hops in his car.

00:10:00.366 --> 00:10:03.602
I race to his car
and I bang on the window.

00:10:03.602 --> 00:10:05.003
And he kind of jumps,
like, "Whoa."

00:10:05.003 --> 00:10:06.472
And he rolls
the window down,

00:10:06.472 --> 00:10:07.940
he's like, "What?
Wha--wha--what's up?"

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:09.775
And I go,
"Apologize! Right now!

00:10:09.775 --> 00:10:12.644
Apologize, say you're sorry!"
And he goes, "What?"

00:10:12.644 --> 00:10:14.980
And I go, "You had no right
to park here!"

00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:17.449
"No right!
Very dangerous!

00:10:17.449 --> 00:10:20.319
Say you're sorry
right now!"

00:10:20.319 --> 00:10:21.453
And...

00:10:21.453 --> 00:10:25.124
he didn't say sorry,
obviously.

00:10:25.124 --> 00:10:27.960
He didn't come close
to an apology.

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:29.361
What he did say was,

00:10:29.361 --> 00:10:31.697
"Fuck you.
Your breath smells,"

00:10:31.697 --> 00:10:33.566
and then he drove away.

00:10:36.301 --> 00:10:39.304
And that hurts, doesn't it?
"Your breath smells."

00:10:39.304 --> 00:10:42.407
That hurts real deep
in the soul, doesn't it?

00:10:42.407 --> 00:10:45.478
That's the worst
"you smell" insult there is.

00:10:45.478 --> 00:10:48.647
There's no worse "you smell"
than "your breath smells."

00:10:48.647 --> 00:10:51.817
I literally--this is how much
"your breath smells" hurts.

00:10:51.817 --> 00:10:53.852
I literally would rather
be receiving

00:10:53.852 --> 00:10:58.157
oral sex from a girl
and the girl stop and be like,

00:10:58.157 --> 00:11:02.327
"Joe, your dick smells
really bad."

00:11:02.327 --> 00:11:03.762
And I'd be like,
"It does? How's my breath?"

00:11:03.762 --> 00:11:06.165
"Your breath is fine,
but your dick reeks."

00:11:06.165 --> 00:11:09.935
"Fuck it, it's a dick, sweetie.
Keep going, wh--I don't care."

00:11:16.875 --> 00:11:19.178
So, uh,
he drives off.

00:11:19.178 --> 00:11:21.247
And now this is the part
in the story where I think

00:11:21.247 --> 00:11:24.717
most people would be like,
"I've lost this round.

00:11:24.717 --> 00:11:27.419
"Time to retreat, go inside,
and buy some sausage

00:11:27.419 --> 00:11:30.189
for dinner tonight,
whatever."

00:11:30.189 --> 00:11:33.225
Uh, but I decided
that I was gonna run

00:11:33.225 --> 00:11:37.195
across the parking lot
so I could intercept his car

00:11:37.195 --> 00:11:39.031
before it left the parking lot
because...

00:11:39.031 --> 00:11:42.568
[stammers]
He needed to know! Okay?

00:11:42.568 --> 00:11:44.770
So I run
across the parking lot...

00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:46.705
[exhales]
Full speed.

00:11:46.705 --> 00:11:49.708
Uh, he's coming,
he sees me coming.

00:11:49.708 --> 00:11:52.043
He's not stopping
'cause he sees me coming.

00:11:52.043 --> 00:11:56.381
So now I'm approaching his car
as he's driving past me,

00:11:56.381 --> 00:11:58.884
and he's passing me,
not stopping.

00:11:58.884 --> 00:12:00.886
I cock back like this,

00:12:00.886 --> 00:12:02.421
and I punch his car

00:12:02.421 --> 00:12:06.057
as hard as I can,
okay?

00:12:06.057 --> 00:12:08.794
Now, some of you
are making a face like,

00:12:08.794 --> 00:12:10.963
"Joe, that's fucking nuts."

00:12:10.963 --> 00:12:13.599
You know what,
fuck you, okay?

00:12:13.599 --> 00:12:15.333
Have you ever
punched a car?

00:12:15.333 --> 00:12:17.102
Ful--when it's moving,
with all your might?

00:12:17.102 --> 00:12:18.637
Do you know
what it feels like?

00:12:18.637 --> 00:12:22.741
Fucking glorious,
that's what it feels like.

00:12:22.741 --> 00:12:26.745
It is the hand of justice
hammering down.

00:12:26.745 --> 00:12:28.580
It felt fucking great!

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:32.618
Until he stopped the car
and he opened the door,

00:12:32.618 --> 00:12:34.253
and he just goes like this,
he goes,

00:12:34.253 --> 00:12:36.922
"Let me get this straight.

00:12:36.922 --> 00:12:40.326
Let me get this straight,
I park where I'm not supposed to

00:12:40.326 --> 00:12:45.597
and that gives you the right
to punch my fucking car?"

00:12:45.597 --> 00:12:48.667
And then he undid his seat belt
and he stood up.

00:12:48.667 --> 00:12:51.303
And as he stood,
he kept screaming at me,

00:12:51.303 --> 00:12:54.173
but I don't mean
screaming words at me.

00:12:54.173 --> 00:12:56.475
He just literally
stood up like this:

00:12:56.475 --> 00:12:59.445
[screams]

00:13:03.615 --> 00:13:06.685
And, uh,
at that point I ran away

00:13:06.685 --> 00:13:09.955
because I didn't--

00:13:09.955 --> 00:13:12.057
I never got that far
in a confrontation before.

00:13:12.057 --> 00:13:16.061
I was like, "That's--
that's not supposed to happen."

00:13:17.496 --> 00:13:19.464
[laughs]

00:13:19.464 --> 00:13:21.299
And as I was running,
I could hear him go,

00:13:21.299 --> 00:13:24.469
he was going,
"Keep running, you pussy!"

00:13:24.469 --> 00:13:26.638
And I--I did.
I was like, "I'm go--yeah,

00:13:26.638 --> 00:13:28.373
"well, absolutely.

00:13:28.373 --> 00:13:31.410
I didn't need that tip,
I know."

00:13:32.544 --> 00:13:34.212
But I was so proud
of myself.

00:13:34.212 --> 00:13:35.914
I really was,
I was proud of myself.

00:13:35.914 --> 00:13:39.418
I was like, "This is what my mom
raised me to do, man."

00:13:39.418 --> 00:13:43.188
You know, she showed me
"Goodfellas" when I was 12.

00:13:43.188 --> 00:13:47.526
We had the
Jesus-committing-suicide thing

00:13:47.526 --> 00:13:49.995
above our couch.

00:13:49.995 --> 00:13:53.365
You sacrifice for what you
believe in, that's what you do.

00:13:53.365 --> 00:13:54.666
And I couldn't wait
to tell my mom

00:13:54.666 --> 00:13:56.435
what I did
to defend her honor,

00:13:56.435 --> 00:13:58.704
and I went in
and I told her the whole story

00:13:58.704 --> 00:14:00.539
right in the middle
of the supermarket.

00:14:00.539 --> 00:14:03.676
And she--all she said was, she
looked at me and she just goes,

00:14:03.676 --> 00:14:08.347
"You make me sick."

00:14:08.347 --> 00:14:10.549
And I was like,
"That's not what you're, uh--

00:14:10.549 --> 00:14:12.451
"that's not what you're supposed
to say right now.

00:14:12.451 --> 00:14:15.921
"That's not what Ray Liotta's
girlfriend says in 'Goodfellas''

00:14:15.921 --> 00:14:19.758
"He hands her a bloody gun
and she says she's turned on.

00:14:19.758 --> 00:14:21.526
"But I don't want you
to say that,

00:14:21.526 --> 00:14:23.729
"but I just mean, you know,

00:14:23.729 --> 00:14:25.530
maybe a thank you."

00:14:25.530 --> 00:14:27.766
And she goes,
"You make me sick."

00:14:27.766 --> 00:14:29.534
And we started arguing
in the supermarket,

00:14:29.534 --> 00:14:31.636
like full-on,
the argument we had been

00:14:31.636 --> 00:14:33.805
trying to avoid for two months

00:14:33.805 --> 00:14:35.540
because she's trying
to recover from cancer.

00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:37.309
Here it is.
The shit is going down.

00:14:37.309 --> 00:14:39.811
And it's not only going down,
it's going down in public.

00:14:39.811 --> 00:14:41.380
And we are screaming,

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:43.215
and at the peak
of the argument--

00:14:43.215 --> 00:14:44.749
I swear to God,
the peak of the argument,

00:14:44.749 --> 00:14:46.552
I just go like this,
I just go,

00:14:46.552 --> 00:14:50.422
"I am no different
than Christ!"

00:14:54.593 --> 00:14:58.730
And my mom goes,
"What are you talking about?"

00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:02.267
And I go, "Jesus saw
money changers in the temple!

00:15:02.267 --> 00:15:04.970
"He went into a rage!
He flipped the tables!

00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:09.642
That's like me punching the car!
I'm just like Christ!"

00:15:11.843 --> 00:15:15.514
And my mom goes,
"You make me sick."

00:15:16.848 --> 00:15:19.818
And for three days--
for three days,

00:15:19.818 --> 00:15:24.756
I told this story
to every single person I knew.

00:15:24.756 --> 00:15:27.426
And every time I told the story,
I made the argument

00:15:27.426 --> 00:15:30.428
that I was not crazy.

00:15:30.428 --> 00:15:35.267
And for three days,
every single person I knew

00:15:35.267 --> 00:15:36.535
said to me,

00:15:36.535 --> 00:15:39.805
"Joe, you're fucking crazy."

00:15:39.805 --> 00:15:42.641
And for three days,
I denied it.

00:15:42.641 --> 00:15:45.778
Until I realized,
"Everybody I know and love

00:15:45.778 --> 00:15:50.448
"is telling me I'm crazy
and I keep saying I'm not.

00:15:50.448 --> 00:15:54.853
That's what crazy people do."

00:15:54.853 --> 00:15:57.322
So the point
of the story is, guys,

00:15:57.322 --> 00:16:00.392
Jesus was fucking crazy.

00:16:00.392 --> 00:16:01.893
[cheers and applause]

00:16:01.893 --> 00:16:03.194
Thank you so much!
