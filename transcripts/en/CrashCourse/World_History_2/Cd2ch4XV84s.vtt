00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:04.160
Hi, I'm John Green, this is Crash Course World
History and today we're going to talk about

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.919
World War I. We actually have two videos about
World War 1. Today we're going to talk about

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.180
how World War I happened. Next week we're
going to talk about why. World War I is a

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:16.240
really big deal. Especially to those of us
who are really interested in like, industrialization

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.390
and nation-states and modernity. So usually
we don't talk that much about wars, but we're

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:21.150
going to make an exception.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.950
Mr. Green, Mr. Green, "Exception?" Cue the
Mongol-tage.

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.949
Yeah, no me from the past. We don't roll the
Mongol-tage every time we use the word exception,

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.649
we roll it when we're talking about how the
Mongols are an exception to a lot of our assumptions

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:35.000
about civilizations.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.200
Stan, Stan- No, there are no Mongols today, we
are talking about World War I.

00:00:47.999 --> 00:00:52.569
So I'm filming this in 2014, which means that
the great war started 100 years ago and the

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:56.739
World War I Centenary is just so hot right
now, I can't miss out on it.

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:01.249
So most historians agree that the event that
started World War I was the assassination

00:01:01.249 --> 00:01:07.900
of Austrian archduke Franz Ferdinand on June 28,
1914, but beyond that, there's not a lot of agreement.

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:12.000
Others say the war really started after Franz
Ferdinand bit it. Like when Germany declared

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.240
war or when Russia mobilized. So looking at
why a war or any historical event happened

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.609
means looking for a cause and effect relationship
that implicitly assumes that if one particular

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:25.930
event in a chain of events had gone differently,
the historical outcome would also be different.

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.859
This is why we have alternate history novels.
Right , like what would have happened in the

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:32.659
American Civil War if the South had won the
Battle at Gettysburg? What would have happened

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:36.759
if the Nazis had repulsed the D-day invasion?
In both cases, probably eventually the same

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:38.270
outcome but that's neither here nor there.

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.270
The question we're looking at today is how.
And that's a much more modest question because

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.460
we can simply discuss a series of events but
it's still a complicated one

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.990
because when you're talking about how, you're
always picking from an uncountable number

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.479
of things that happened. You know, a butterfly
flaps its wings and that leads to a series

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:56.280
of events and then eventually across the world
an archduke gets killed.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.369
So even when it comes to a relatively straightforward
question like how, you'll never get to the

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:03.520
bottom of all of it, but today we're going
to discuss some of the how.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.140
So one way or another, all wars start with
a breakdown in peaceful relations between

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.400
the eventual belligerents and World War I
is no exception.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.400
Oh, for the love of agriculture please stop
it.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.980
Right, but World War I is a bit unusual in
that we have a concrete event and a date to

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.010
start our discussion. Sometimes we get lucky,
historically, and there's an invasion that

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.200
starts a war like in the Korean conflict or the firing
on Fort Sumter in the American Civil War.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.840
But other times, it's much more butterfly
effect-y with events that might or might not

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.580
lead to a war, building upon each other until
one side mobilizes or declares war or there's

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.220
a fight over who shot first.

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:46.100
But here we have a specific assassination of a
specific archduke, Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo.

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.930
Now it wasn't a great day for Franz to visit
Bosnia since it was the anniversary of the

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.200
Serbs defeat at Kosovo Polje in 1389 and also
St. Vitus's day, which was a celebration for

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.680
Slavic nationalists and a Bosnian Serb named
Gavrilo Princip and his co-conspirators chose

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.790
to celebrate Slavic nationalism by killing
Franz Ferdinand.

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.600
Now they didn't choose Franz Ferdinand at random. He
was the heir apparent of the Austro-Hungarian Empire

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.200
Franz Ferdinand wasn't particularly well liked,
not by his uncle who was the head of the Austro-Hungarian Empire,

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.620
certainly not by Bosnian Serb nationalists,
also not really by everyone else in Europe

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.700
except for the German Kaiser, but Franz Ferdinand
was in his way kind of a moderate.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.840
Oh it's time for the open letter. Oh look
it's a collection of my favorite assassinated

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.300
moderates. It's hard out there for a moderate.

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:28.970
An open letter to moderates:

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.540
Dear moderates, so one of the reasons that
Franz Ferdinand's uncle didn't like him that

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:37.090
much is that the emperor was really hardcore,
whereas Franz Ferdinand, you know, he was

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:38.180
kind of a moderate.

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.600
He was like you know, "I'm an Austro-Hungarian
through and through but I see the Serbian arguement."

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.670
Really, Franz Ferdinand was the one leader
in the empire who might have come up with

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.880
a solution to the problems of Serbian expansion
and Bosnian independence. And murdering moderates

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:56.790
has a way of making other moderates, you know,
more extreme. In short moderates, your work

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.700
may not be romantic, it may not appeal to
the youth, but it is heroic and very dangerous.

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.580
Best wishes, John Green.

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:08.350
So even though Franz Ferdinand's uncle didn't
particularly like him, as the emperor of Austria-Hungary,

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:12.930
he felt a certain responsibility to, you know,
do something. Otherwise the Serbia nationalists

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.780
would feel like they could expand their territory
at the expense of the empire, so despite what

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:23.240
you often hear about World War I being pointless,
this makes sense as a point sort of.

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.040
Now it's a bit of schoolyard bully kind of
diplomacy, but it does make a certain sense,

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.220
if Serbia can get bigger, then all of the
other places will think that they can have

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.620
have nations too. Soon enough, you don't have
an empire.

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.150
Now there's still some debate about whether
Princip and his fellow assassins acted alone

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.630
or as part of a larger conspiracy organized
by the Serbian government. But the Austrians

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:44.760
certainly thought there was broader involvement which
is why the whole thing ended up becoming a war.

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:49.210
So Princip was a member of the scary sounding
Black Hand, a group dedicated to creating

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:54.120
a greater Serbia that would include Bosnia
and there's some evidence that the Serbian

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.710
chief of military intelligence was in on the
assassination plot or at least knew about it.

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:02.340
In fact, it's likely that the bombs and
pistols the assassins used were supplied by

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:06.750
a Serbian army officer, but this is still
pretty controversial so much so that people

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:08.660
are currently fighting about it in comments.

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:14.120
So almost a month after the assassination,
on July 23, Austria issued an ultimatum to

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:17.540
Serbia. And Austria intentionally made the
demands so harsh that the Serbs would inevitably

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:22.660
have to reject them and ergo war, but that
doesn't explain the month long delay.

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:26.810
What happened in that month? Well Austria's
foreign minister, Berchtold, was afraid that

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:31.590
if they attacked Serbia, Russia would then
attack Austria-Hungary, so the Austrians spent

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:36.210
that month talking to their ally, Germany
to make sure the Germans would have Austria's

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:40.730
back. The Austro-Hungarians got assurance
on July 5 or July 6 in the form of what has

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:46.410
been called the "blank check", a promise from Germany
that they would help Austria if Russia mobilized.

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:49.230
And it was clear that the Germans expected
the Austrians to move quickly in

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:53.230
response to the assassination, not like wait
for another twenty days. So usually I don't

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:57.100
care about dates, but at this point the timing becomes
pretty important. Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:01.910
So when the Serbs received the Austrians ultimatum,
Russia declared itself to be in a period preparatory

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:06.380
to war, which sounds a lot like mobilization
but technically it wasn't, which Russia's

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:08.520
foreign minister emphasized to the Germans.

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:12.870
The Tsar proved the measure on July 25, and
it went into effect on July 26.

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:17.240
The Serbs rejected Austria's ultimatum on
July 25, but they made their rejection sound

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:21.330
like a capitulation so the Germans thought
that war had been averted. And they were kind

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:25.680
of surprised then on July 28 when Austria
suddenly declared war on Serbia even though

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:29.080
the Austrian army wasn't actually ready to
start fighting.

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:33.520
Then on July 30, Russia exited its period
preparatory to war and actually officially

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:38.240
mobilized. Germany warned the Russians to
stand down but two days later on August 1,

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:42.510
France mobilized it's armed forces in support
of Russia and that same day, Germany mobilized

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:43.750
and declared war on Russia.

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:47.180
So if you're keeping score at home - and good
historians always do - Austria and Germany

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:51.830
were the first to declare war on July 28 and
August 1 respectively, but Russia with its

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:57.540
pre-mobilization mobilization was actually
ready to begin fighting before Serbia rejected

00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:58.680
Austria's ultimatum.

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:03.240
Anyway, then Germany declared war on France
on August 3, marched through Belgium to invade,

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:07.270
hoping to quickly knock out the French and
focus on Russia. Sorry France but you know

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:09.199
Russia's a big deal and you, you know.

00:07:09.199 --> 00:07:12.900
German troops crossed Belgium's border on
August 4 and the British issued an ultimatum

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:16.919
to the Germans telling them to get out of
Belgium or else. Germany chose "or else" and

00:07:16.919 --> 00:07:22.330
Britain declared war. So by August 4, 1914,
all the major powers involved in World War

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:24.620
I were officially at war with each other.

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:25.060
Thanks Thought Bubble.

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:28.300
Now I know there were a lot of other powers
that would get involved later including the

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:31.870
United States, and Japan, and the Ottoman
Empire -- even Italy.

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:35.889
But for the nations who did most of the actual
fighting, Germany, Austria-Hungary, Russia,

00:07:35.889 --> 00:07:41.050
Serbia, France, Great Britain, the war happened
both very quickly and very slowly.

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:44.690
Now looking back, it all happened almost at
once but if you're in the middle of it, a

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:48.870
month is a long time and at any point someone,
like say the archduke, Franz Ferdinand could

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:50.990
have come in and said, "Wait a second."

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:53.210
Well I guess not anyone because he was dead.

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:57.570
But that's how an act of terrorism in a Bosnian
city turned into the first major European

00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:01.580
war of the 20th century. A war that still
resonates today. Now the Austrians and the

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:06.070
Serbs probably both imagined that the war
could stay localized to the Balkans especially

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:10.100
since there had been previous conflicts in the
region that hadn't blown up into a world war.

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:16.600
You know, like in 1908 and 1912 and 1913.
We'll get into what made 1914 different next week.

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:21.000
The "why's" of course will always be very
complicated, but for now please remember that

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.180
we are always in the middle of a "how." Those
living in June and July of 1914 could never

00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:30.580
have imagined how significant that month would
be for human history and when thinking about

00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:34.519
them, it's worth remembering that we also
can't imagine what our decisions today will

00:08:34.519 --> 00:08:36.009
mean in 100 years.

00:08:36.009 --> 00:08:37.550
Thanks for watching. I'll see you next week.

00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:41.930
