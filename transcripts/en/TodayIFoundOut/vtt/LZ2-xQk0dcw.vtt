00:00:04.089 --> 00:00:09.980
Prior to his role as Will Smith in The Fresh
Prince of Bel-Air, Willard Smith (yes, Willard)

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.401
enjoyed a successful career as a rapper under
the pseudonym, “The Fresh Prince” as part

00:00:14.401 --> 00:00:18.359
of a duo with Jeffrey “DJ Jazzy Jeff”
Townes.

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.800
The partnership, performing under the rather
unimaginative name of DJ Jazzy Jeff &amp; The

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.240
Fresh Prince, made Smith a considerable amount
of what we like to think the kids today still

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.529
call cheddar.

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:32.789
The pair met in 1985 when Townes, who was
performing at a house-party near Smith’s

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:35.910
house, needed a hype man, as his normal guy
hadn’t shown up.

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.570
Smith, who was only 17 years old at this point,
happily filled in and was apparently so good

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.710
that Townes became annoyed when his actual
hype man arrived a few hours later.

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.770
Hitting it off, Smith and Townes teamed up
and less than a year later, they had a number

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:53.930
one hit with the single “Girls Ain’t Nothing
But Trouble” making Smith a millionaire

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:55.600
before he’d even left high school.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.740
The pair added to their success with more
albums and singles, netting Smith even more

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:07.030
money, which he then spent like he was a member
of the 18th century French aristocracy.

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.369
According to the man himself, “I had a hit
single on the radio for 30 days before I graduated

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:12.479
from high school.

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:13.909
That’s dangerous.

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:15.329
It just seemed easy.”

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:19.709
According to Smith, he spent about $6 million
in half as many years.

00:01:19.709 --> 00:01:24.369
However, during that time, he more or less
forgot about the whole “taxes” thing.

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:28.560
Far from being a deliberate act of deception,
this was almost entirely down to the fact

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.810
Smith had literally no idea what he was doing
with his money, despite being otherwise quite

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:33.810
intelligent, reflected in his school grades
and SAT scores.

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.669
When asked about why he never bothered to
pay his income taxes during his teenage years,

00:01:37.669 --> 00:01:42.229
Smith very sheepishly responded in one interview
with “You get paid in cash, and you forget

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:43.229
those things.”

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:49.669
You may think this all sounds pretty inexcusable,
but imagine being handed several million dollars

00:01:49.669 --> 00:01:51.069
while you’re still in high school.

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:56.459
Would you have then dutifully taken a quick
course on filing taxes and how to properly

00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:57.459
invest?

00:01:57.459 --> 00:02:01.109
Or would you have done what Smith did and
buy a huge home, give money to your friends

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:04.869
and family, and purchase a fleet of cars?

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.380
While you’re mulling that over, consider
that about 1/3 of big ticket lotto winners

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.489
declare bankruptcy within five years of winning
and a good percentage of the rest tend not

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:18.489
to do much better, if at least avoiding bankruptcy.

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:22.710
Also consider that suddenly inheriting large
sums of money tends to see the same type of

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:27.239
end results for those who inherit it as we
see with the big ticket lotto winners.

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:31.920
In fact, in both of these cases, you’re
significantly more likely to need to declare

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.819
bankruptcy in your lifetime after acquiring
these massive funds, than if you never did.

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:42.989
So from all this, we’re guessing a not insignificant
number of people, whether they want to admit

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:49.240
it to themselves or not, would have done pretty
much exactly what Smith did, especially at

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.560
17 years old.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.769
So after blowing through millions of dollars,
buying such must-haves as a necklace with

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:00.069
the words “The Fresh Prince” encrusted
on it in diamonds, 19 year old Will Smith

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:03.480
was woken up by the IRS knocking on his door.

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.969
Smith later stated, “They wanted $2.8 million
and I had two dollars and eighty three cents.”

00:03:08.969 --> 00:03:11.569
We can only assume when he told them he didn’t
have any money, using that charm and charisma

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:12.569
that got him the nickname “Prince” in
the first place, he perhaps also turned his

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:16.109
pockets inside out, shrugged and made a “I’m
sorry” face.

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:20.359
Whether the scene played out like that or
not, the IRS proceeded to take all of his

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:21.359
stuff.

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:24.170
The effect of this massive debt was felt by
Smith almost immediately.

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.359
As Smith said, “There’s nothing more sobering
than having six cars and a mansion one day

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:31.019
and you can’t even buy gas… the next.”

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:37.590
By 1989-1990, he was broke, and not only broke,
but owing massive sums to the IRS, an organization

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.670
not exactly known for forgiving debt and which
maintains amazingly high interest rates on

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.420
unpaid taxes.

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:49.560
This is when life handed Smith a way to get
out of the pile of crap of a situation he

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:50.790
had put himself into.

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:55.060
Though many fans assume The Fresh Prince of
Bel-Air was loosely based on Smith’s own

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.099
life, the original idea and concept for the
show is actually based on the life of music

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:01.299
industry big-wig, Benny Medina.

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:04.999
Medina was orphaned at a young age while living
in “one of the poorest neighborhoods in

00:04:04.999 --> 00:04:09.930
south California” before being adopted by
a wealthy white family living in Beverly Hills.

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.239
Medina, who is black if you hadn’t guessed
from the subsequent show based on his life,

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:18.000
felt that his life would make good fodder
for a fish out of water comedy and pitched

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.280
the idea to an interested Smith when the pair
met at a party on the set of the Arsenio Hall

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:23.340
talk-show.

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.280
When Medina then approached TV heavy hitter
Quincy Jones with his pitch, he showed interest,

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.810
but suggested a few changes, among which were
turning the wealthy white family into a wealthy

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.630
black family, as well as changing the adopted
child into a family member.

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:39.550
When the show was picked up by NBC, Smith
was offered the starring role.

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.680
Though the show was a well received success
and Smith had learned his lesson about money

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.770
management, behind the scenes his money troubles
were not yet over; you see, according to Smith,

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:53.780
for the first three years the show ran, 70%
of his earnings were garnished by the IRS

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.560
to pay off his back taxes and cover the new
ones.

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.781
Lucky for him, the show not only lasted through
those three seasons he needed to pay off his

00:05:00.781 --> 00:05:03.850
back taxes, but three more on top of that.

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:08.389
Smith also managed to parlay The Fresh Prince
of Bel-Air into a career as one of the most

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:11.270
successful male actors in history.

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:15.930
So I guess his life really did get “flipped-turned
upside down” during the show.

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:23.419
Note to self, when massively in debt, simply
make truckloads more money.

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:25.819
Genius.

00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:26.819
😉

00:05:26.819 --> 00:05:29.660
The “Carlton Dance” was inspired by 20
year old Courteney Cox’s dancing in the

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:34.750
1984 Bruce Springsteen music video “Dancing
in the Dark” (see here).

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:38.979
Uncle Phil, also occasionally known as James
Avery in the real world, was the voice of

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:41.550
James Rhodes in the 1990s Iron Man series.

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:48.539
He was also the voice of Shredder in the original
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle cartoon series.

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:52.380
While brainstorming ideas for what his character
on the show would be called, Alfonso Ribeiro

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:56.289
(Carlton) told Smith, “Whatever this character
is called, that’s what you’re going to

00:05:56.289 --> 00:06:00.699
be called for the rest of your life, so call
your character, Will Smith“.

00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:02.979
Taking his advice, Smith did exactly that.

00:06:02.979 --> 00:06:06.909
As anticipated, according to Smith, when he
and Alfonso are out in public together, people

00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:08.960
still call them “Will and Carlton”.

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:13.000
It should be noted, though, that technically
the character’s name and Smith’s aren’t

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.000
the same.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.560
As noted previously, the real first name of
Will Smith is “Willard”, while on the

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:20.300
show it is William.

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:25.759
The band Earth, Wind &amp; Fire inspired the name
of Uncle Phil’s law firm on the show- Firth,

00:06:25.759 --> 00:06:28.280
Wynn, and Meyer.

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:32.159
Despite the show doing well off the bat, Karyn
Parsons (Hilary Banks) continued working as

00:06:32.159 --> 00:06:35.199
a waitress during the early episodes, just
in case it got canceled.

00:06:35.199 --> 00:06:39.500
She stated of this, “Will, James, Benny
and all the guys would come by and laugh and

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:40.780
point at me through the window.

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:42.750
They would bang on the window, ‘What are
you doing here?

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:43.840
We have a TV show!’

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.770
I’m thinking, ‘I don’t know what’s
going to happen with that show!’

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:47.770
You just don’t know…

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:49.190
It’s the same thing with Will.

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:52.560
Although you know he’s incredibly charismatic,
it doesn’t mean that you thought, ‘Hey,

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:54.220
he’s going to be this megastar.’

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:57.490
You aren’t surprised, but when you are just
hanging out with him, you aren’t thinking,

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:20.500
‘You are going to be King 
of the Universe someday.'”
