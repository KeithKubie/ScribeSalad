00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.240
All right.
Enough of that, but

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.230
this idea of which
categories are best for

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:11.590
visual identification is a challenge for
doing this labelling.

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:13.010
So, let's assume for

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:16.400
a moment that we're going to have
some set of visual categories.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.140
A question you might ask is,
about how many of them are there?

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.130
It's kind of a weird question to ask,
you know,

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.000
how many types of things are there?

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:25.660
But you know, look,

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.660
we've got a finite amount of gelatinous
stuffed between our ears, and

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.900
there's this question of sort of, how
many different labels do you deal with?

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.150
So Irv Biederman, a psychologist and
does work in cognitive vision and,

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.010
and mental models for doing vision,
back in the, in the 80s,

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:45.890
he came up with this number of
about 10 to 30 thousand, okay?

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.590
Now, big range, but
it's an interesting idea,

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.320
because it's also related if you take a
look at the number of nouns people know.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.190
That is, you could ask how
many nouns do you know?

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.890
Well, it's not going to be 2 million and
it's not going to be 11,

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.730
at least I hope if you're watching this,
it's not 11.

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:00.640
Okay?

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.740
It's in the tens of thousands of range.

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:04.310
Okay?
So it

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:09.410
gives you some idea of sort of
the scale of the recognition problem.

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:10.360
There are, by the way,

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.500
other types of categories other than
just sort of natural categories.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.360
So, for example,
you think about functional categories.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.220
So, here's a set of chairs, and yes,
you can sit in all these things,

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.900
although some of them look
like they would be kind of

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.160
stunningly uncomfortable, but they
don't really share a visual property.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.900
So you can imagine that semantically,
in your head,

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.860
you know that they have
a certain relationship.

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.620
But from a recognition perspective,
it's not clear that the same process

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.920
that recognizes this as a chair,
should also recognize that as a chair.

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.510
Another type of category which is valid,
but not perceptually relevant might be

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:51.170
the sort of ad hoc categories of things
you find in an office environment.

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:52.760
That's a perfectly natural category.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.235
In fact, it's even a category which you
can think about probabilistic reasoning

00:01:56.235 --> 00:01:57.101
as biasing things.

00:01:57.101 --> 00:01:59.830
Right?
If I tell you you're in an office,

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.335
you're much more likely
to find a stapler, right,

00:02:03.335 --> 00:02:05.630
than to find a horse whip.

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.360
So maybe that would
bias your recognition.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.350
But the notion of it being
a single visual category

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.970
as you can see from these objects
doesn't make a lot of sense.
