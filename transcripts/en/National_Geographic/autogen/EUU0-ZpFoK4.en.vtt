00:00:00.189 --> 00:00:03.560
(dramatic music)

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.910
- [Narrator] They are nestled
in the final frontier,

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:11.670
countless worlds, scattered
throughout countless galaxies,

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.083
challenged the notion that
we are alone in the universe.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.950
Exoplanets are worlds that exist

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:24.930
outside of our solar system.

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.420
Also known as Extrasolar planets,

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.040
these bodies often orbit their own stars,

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:34.480
with some being a part of
entire planetary systems.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.780
Exoplanets are made of the same elements

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.310
as the world's and our solar system,

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:41.630
and based on their
composition and structures

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:43.263
are just as diverse.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.050
Some, known as giant or
Neptune-like planets,

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.053
are large gaseous worlds.

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.720
Other gas giants called Hot Jupiters

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.570
closely orbit their stars

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.320
causing the planets to have
high surface temperatures.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.180
Another category of exoplanets

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.620
consists of Super Earths.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.830
Smaller than the gas giants
but larger than earth,

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.460
Super Earths are terrestrial

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.513
and made primarily of
rocky or icy material.

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.790
The final category includes Earth analogs.

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.460
Much as their name implies,

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.690
Earth Analogs are similar
to Earth in various ways,

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:23.570
including size, composition

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.653
and distance to their home star.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.190
Exoplanets are difficult
to detect directly.

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.903
Mostly because they are out
shined by the stars they orbit.

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.930
To circumvent this, about
five primary methods

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.880
have been developed to find
these planetary bodies,

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.520
including radio velocity,
in which a planet

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.333
causes a star to wobble.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.460
Direct imaging,

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.760
where the glare of stars is blocked

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.783
in order to see objects nearby.

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.650
Astrometry, which observes
the star's movements

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.673
in relation to nearby stars.

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.040
Gravitational microlensing,

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.750
which observes the light of a star

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.340
being dent by a planet's
gravitational pull.

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.930
And the most prolific form of
finding exoplanets, transit.

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.700
The method in which a planet passes

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.670
between its star and Earth,

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.593
thereby deeming its star's light.

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.270
Scientists have suspected
the existence of worlds

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.060
outside of our solar system
for thousands of years.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.160
But the first confirmed
existence of an exoplanet

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.123
orbiting a sun-like star
only occurred in 1995.

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.650
Ever since, about 4000
exoplanets have been confirmed

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.840
by multiple discovery methods,

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.170
with about 3,000 more
awaiting verification.

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:48.870
According to one theory,

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.430
at least one exoplanet orbits
each star in the Milky Way.

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.430
This would place the exoplanet count

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.993
in our local galaxy to about one trillion.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.440
The search for exoplanets continues,

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.650
not just to create a
catalog of known worlds,

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.570
but also to see if life
may exist elsewhere

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:11.573
in the universe.

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.870
Astrobiologists closely study the size,

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.650
composition, and location of exoplanets

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.280
relative to their stars

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.150
to see the likelihood of organisms

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.693
thriving in an environment
other than earth.

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:28.923
Who knows what discoveries
these new worlds could bring?
