00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.050
So, okay so let's, let's actually do some inferencing just to, to

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:05.980
kind of get a feel for it. For certain kinds of networks we

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.250
can do things exactly. And we're going to look at one of

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.970
those examples in just a moment. But, it turns out, helpful to

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:14.630
remind ourselves of some rules of probability in inference that will help

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.770
us do that. So, here's just kind of a little cheat sheet.

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:20.890
For you, so, marginalization is this idea that we can represent the

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.290
probability of, of a value, at, by summing over some other variable and

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:28.375
looking at the joint probabilities of those. And if, if

00:00:28.375 --> 00:00:30.530
you've trouble remembering this one, this, this's how I like to

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.310
think about it, if we're trying to figure out the probablitiy

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.590
of x, then one way, one thing we can do is

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.020
break it up in. Break the world up into, well

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:44.240
the cases where x and, not y. Plus, places where x

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.090
and y. So, the probability of x is it can be

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.480
broken down into the probability of x when y is false

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.820
plus the probability of x when y is true. So

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.900
it's really simple in that sense, but it actually turns out

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.230
to be a useful thing to be able to do.

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.050
To marginalize out. The chain rule, we've used this a bunch

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.580
of times. The probability of x and y can be

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.050
written as the probability of x times the probability of y

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:08.120
given x. And that's important that we've the given X. If

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.740
we drop that then what is that implying? Just go ahead.

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:12.710
&gt;&gt; Well, if you drop that then it

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.920
implies that they are completly independent of one another.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.120
&gt;&gt; Right, in the case where the variables

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.070
are independent, you can just look at their product.

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.680
In the general case you actually have to

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.300
look at the second one given the first one.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.650
&gt;&gt; And as I recall, the order on the

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.120
left doesn't matter, so, you have the probability of X times

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.460
the probability of Y give X, but you could have written the

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.850
probability of Y times the probability of, X given Y.

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.910
&gt;&gt; Yes. And, actually, let's do a quick quiz.

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:40.470
&gt;&gt; Okay.
