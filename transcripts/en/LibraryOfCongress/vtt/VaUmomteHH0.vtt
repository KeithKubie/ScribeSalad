00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.980
&gt;&gt; Beacher Wiggins:
Good morning, everyone.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.310
I'm Beacher Wiggins,
Director for Acquisitions

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.280
and Bibliographic Access
here at the Library,

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:36.890
and it's again a pleasure
to start off, and actually,

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.820
this is our first
session for the year

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.820
of LC's Digital Future and You!

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.860
that is coordinated by Angela
Kinney and Judith Cannan,

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.950
two of the chiefs in ABA,
who have been doing this

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.580
for a little while now.

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:59.550
And we try to find interesting
topics and presenters to come

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.730
and help keep you informed in
some of the latest that's going

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.260
on related to automation
applications

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.910
and automated techniques.

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:15.430
This morning, I am particularly
pleased because we are focusing

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.950
on BIBFRAME, the
model that the Library

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.740
of Congress has been
developing under the auspices

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.740
of Network Development and MARC
Standards Office, Sally McCallum

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.560
and her capable staff, have been
developing what we're expecting

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.960
to be the replacement
for the MARC format.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.580
I have been working with
our presenters this morning,

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:44.740
Tiziana Possemato, and Michele
Casalini for a while now.

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.860
We have been involved
with Casalini as one

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.920
of our leading acquisitions
vendors,

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:58.630
and in the past few years with
their exploration and working

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.030
with BIBFRAME as a model
and helping us to prove

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:09.190
that BIBFRAME can be
expanded and is scalable.

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:16.660
Their involvement with
BIBFRAME has been related

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.450
to their development

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.990
of the shared virtual discovery
environment in linked data,

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:27.940
what they are dubbing SHARE-VDE,
and they will be talking

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.130
about that this morning.

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.190
And SHARE-VDE is a
community-driven research

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.680
and development project with a
chief goal of bringing BIBFRAME

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:45.020
into a practice that libraries,
librarians, and the library

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.690
and library patrons
can put to good use.

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.510
So, they'll give us some sense
of what they've been doing

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.250
with this, and the Library
of Congress has been one

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:00.000
of the institutions that
has been working with them

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.560
on the SHARE-VDE approach.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.420
Tiziana is the Chief
Information Officer of Casalini,

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.150
and she's also Director
of @CULT.

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:17.010
She holds a degree in philosophy
from La Sapienza in Rome

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:22.590
and diplomas in Archival
Science and Library Sciences

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.270
from the Vatican Library Schools
and has also a master's degree

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:30.700
in Library Sciences from
the University of Florence.

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.510
She has led numerous
projects during her career,

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:41.150
both for library automation, for
analysis mapping and conversion,

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.570
and for the transformation
of LinkUp and data

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:49.570
into a publication format
for numerous institutions.

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:55.290
Michele Casalini is the
Managing Director of Casalini,

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.570
which produces authority
data and bibliographic data

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:04.000
in addition to supplying
books and journals

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.270
for the customer
base of Casalini.

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:11.550
Following studies in Modern
languages and literature

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:15.040
at the University of Florence
and a period of working

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.330
in the publishing
company La Nuova Italia,

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:21.720
Michele specialized in
the field of Information

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.580
and Technology Management.

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.720
Michele is also a board member
of the Council on Library

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.650
and Information Resources.

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:38.280
So, we have very well-informed
presenters this morning,

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.840
and I look forward to
hearing what they have to say,

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.870
even though I am
familiar with some of it,

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.750
and I more especially
want you as LC staff

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.620
to hear what's been going on.

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.770
So, Tiziana and Michele,
and I'll let you decide

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:57.070
who goes first, and maybe
you play off each other.

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.130
&gt;&gt; Michele Casalini: Thank
you very much, Beacher,

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:09.330
and thank you all
for being here.

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:14.190
For Tiziana and me, it's a
great privilege to be here today

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:16.930
and to have the opportunity
to talk to you

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:21.390
about the SHARE Virtual
Discovery Environment project.

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:25.400
As you know, Casalini Libri
is one of the main suppliers

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.950
of European publications,
cataloging,

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:29.300
and technical services

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.310
to academic libraries
across the world.

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:36.190
We have been working with the
Library of Congress for decades,

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:40.630
are a member of PCC, the Program
for Cooperative Cataloging,

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:43.930
participating in NACO and SACO,

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:49.070
and our original cataloging
division has received valuable

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:53.100
input from the Library during
the implementation of RDA

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:58.870
which begun on day one,
March 31st of 2015.

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:03.270
After the first year of RDA,
we began to collect input

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:07.210
from the Library community
on the application and tools

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:09.660
of the emerging BIBFRAME
data model.

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:14.700
The input received form the
wider library community and,

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:18.340
in particular, the Library
of Congress, made it clear

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:23.730
that we would in the future be
expected to supply data not only

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:28.190
in MARC format but also
according to the new framework.

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:31.740
In response, we embarked
on a strategy

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:34.780
for the progressive
implementation of BIBFRAME

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:37.720
in close collaboration
with @CULT,

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:40.960
our long-standing
technological partner

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:45.550
with extensive experience
in technological solutions

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:48.440
for cultural heritage
institutions.

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:52.710
@CULT has also been a
technological partner

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:54.830
of [inaudible], automatic
publication

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:58.070
and a linked data
provider of library data,

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:02.260
an European community
funded project.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.980
Following a series
of initial studies

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:09.330
and a feasibility
analysis in January 2016,

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:13.020
we presented the first
results and a plan for action

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:16.280
at the Library of Congress
BIBFRAME Update Forum

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:20.020
at Midwinter ALA in Boston.

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:24.910
Considering that this evolution
had an effect on many aspects

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:27.420
of the traditional Library
catalog, for example,

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:31.080
the format, organization,
and retrieval of data,

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:34.940
the objectives stand out
and interpretations will be

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:38.680
in continuous transformation
for quite some time.

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:43.190
Each organization will have
its own specific workflow.

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:49.200
We were very pleased in the
summer 2016 to receive approval

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:53.120
and support of 12 North
American institutions

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:55.550
for the SHARE-VDE project.

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:59.220
We are particularly grateful
to our contacts and colleagues

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:01.050
at Stanford University Libraries

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:05.270
for their valuable
thrust and encouragement.

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:09.290
We feel a great responsibility
and ever-growing enthusiasm

00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:12.150
for this research and
development initiative,

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:16.010
which aims to make real steps
toward the effective use

00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:18.110
of BIBFRAME.

00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:20.940
Seeing not only the
practical results

00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:23.910
but also the incredible
potential of linked data

00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:29.280
for providing discoverability
has been extremely satisfying.

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:32.930
Indeed, using linked
data in libraries,

00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:36.270
catalogs can provide a
number of advantages.

00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:40.610
It gives visibility to and
other information and resources

00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:42.690
that would otherwise be hidden.

00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:46.870
It helps to connect and improve
interoperability among library

00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:50.420
archives and museum domains.

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:54.180
It is a basis for new
cooperative initiatives

00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:57.540
in the sector, and it
improves accessibility

00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:00.440
for library patrons
and the wider public

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:05.360
with the ultimate benefit of
safeguarding cultural heritage.

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:09.970
Of course, some problems
have emerged during our work

00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:11.990
on the project, and
we will see some

00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:14.400
of these during the
presentation.

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:18.950
The work is since the beginning
based on the requirements

00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:22.120
and expectations of
the library community,

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:25.920
and this will be the driving
force for the definition

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:30.090
of the activities and priorities
to be put into production,

00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:32.070
the Phase III, modulizing

00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:35.850
and parametrizing individual
components as necessary.

00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:38.410
I hope there will
be enough time later

00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:42.100
for questions and
for a discussion.

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:46.140
With that in mind, let's
now look into details

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:49.480
at the results of
Phase I and II.

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:53.440
I will cover only the first
part of the presentation.

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:57.390
The majority will be
handled by Tiziana Possemato,

00:09:57.390 --> 00:10:02.030
who is the Director
of the project.

00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:10.620
This is the index of the topics
that we will cover this morning.

00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:11.920
I'm sorry.

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:18.250
You already know who we are,
and we are based in Florence

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:23.450
and Rome and a little bit,
I mean, the background

00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:29.430
of our company that
I mentioned before.

00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:35.530
What we are at the
starting point

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:39.090
of a design of the project.

00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:42.990
First of all, the enrichment of
MARC records with URIs in order

00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:48.910
to simplify and make the
BIBFRAME conversion possible

00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:50.850
and more effective, of course.

00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:54.630
The use of a framework to
automate the conversion

00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:59.270
from MARC into RDF, using
BIBFRAME vocabulary,

00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:03.070
and the creation of a BIBFRAME
layered platform prototype

00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:06.790
starting from bibliographic
and authority records, to test

00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:09.150
and to demonstrate
the advantages

00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:13.150
that the BIBFRAME data model
is bringing, and this has been

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:17.960
in order for us at the
beginning a surprising element

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:23.320
because we understood that it
is necessary in order to discuss

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:27.650
and to share future
plans with the community,

00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:33.150
really to touch completely the
potential advantages of the new,

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:37.610
that the new data
model can bring.

00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:42.950
The main goals of Phase
1 and 2 of that Research

00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:47.570
and Development project
has been a reconciliation

00:11:47.570 --> 00:11:51.780
and clusterization of variant
forms of the same entity,

00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:59.050
a key element and starting point
for several further activities;

00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:03.000
the enrichment of MARC records
with URIs with the development

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.160
of detection procedures
for entity identification,

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:09.910
including relator terms;
the conversion, supply,

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:12.790
and management of authority
and bibliographical data

00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:16.940
in BIBFRAME taking into account
the complexity of the long

00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:21.040
and heterogeneous transition
time on both the library

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:25.690
and the data producer sides; and
the publication, as I mentioned,

00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:30.370
of a BIBFRAME three-layered
platform prototype.

00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:36.360
Phase 1, in particular,
has seen the contribution

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:39.840
of the participating
libraries with their datasets

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:47.220
with their record of two
imprint years, 1985 and 2015.

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:52.000
The reason to have these
two different imprint years,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.570
we are to have a record
so that we are based

00:12:54.570 --> 00:12:59.220
on the different rules, and
the RDA records in 2015 and,

00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:03.170
of course, pre-RDA
records for 1985.

00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:07.150
A total of approximately 2
million bibliographical records

00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:10.610
and 3 million authority
records were processed,

00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:14.960
converted at that time in
BIBFRAME 1 and then released

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:17.680
on the SHARE-VDE portal.

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:20.800
This phase ended one year ago.

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:26.500
Phase 2 of the project,
and it was seen that each

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:30.130
of the participant libraries
sent us their entire catalog.

00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:34.080
So, we handled approximately
100 million bibliographical

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:37.210
and authority records.

00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:40.710
A relationship database that
registers the relationships

00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:44.590
between entities, person,
work, instances, subjects,

00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:47.360
publishers is established
in order

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:50.650
to assure a more precise
identification rate

00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:54.110
for each entity in order
to reach a higher quality

00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:57.810
of results without
human intervention.

00:13:57.810 --> 00:14:02.280
And of course, we have worked on
refinement of data, for example,

00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:07.190
for co-authors or editors,
where there is a variety of ways

00:14:07.190 --> 00:14:11.460
in which they are
identified in library records.

00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:18.910
And Phase 2 handled the
export of data in RDF format,

00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:26.150
filtering the library preferred
URIs, of course, in BIBFRAME 2.

00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:32.380
And we included URI sources
from a number of projects.

00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:40.230
We analyzed, and we made an
analysis for the creation

00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:46.540
of the relationships between
subject terms and strings

00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:49.250
in different languages,
and we worked

00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:52.460
on the Provenance
Declaration, update management,

00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:58.610
and built-in instances that
are also quite key elements

00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:04.430
and prerequisites for
the production scene.

00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:10.550
So, we ended now Phase 2,
and we are now discussing

00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:16.580
with the library community
about priorities and use cases

00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:20.080
for a modular implementation,
introduction

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:23.360
of the various components
for Phase 3.

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:28.270
That will, of course, vary
from institution to institution

00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:31.680
because worker workflows
are different,

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:33.480
the habits are different,

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:37.790
and so there is absolutely
not one schema that works,

00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:42.280
one working schema
that works for all.

00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:45.290
These are, this is a list
of the participant libraries

00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:52.250
in Phase 1 and/or
Phase 2 of the project.

00:15:53.730 --> 00:15:59.170
So, I ask now Tiziana to move
on with a very brief overview

00:15:59.170 --> 00:16:01.950
of theoretical context.

00:16:01.950 --> 00:16:03.430
&gt;&gt; Tiziana Possemato: Thank you.

00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:08.440
The theoretical context
will be briefly, of course,

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:13.630
because you know all these
environments where we are,

00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:24.580
and we started from March
21, and we analyze the factor

00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:31.080
of a conversion using RDA
records and, of course,

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:35.900
we try to have in mind also
the International Cataloging

00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:41.370
Principles and the FRBR model.

00:16:41.370 --> 00:16:44.440
And of course, to
arrive to a conversion

00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:49.760
in semantic web linked
data using specifically

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:51.630
but not totally BIBFRAME.

00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:56.410
So, our focus is on
BIBFRAME but, of course,

00:16:56.410 --> 00:17:00.770
each library can choose to
add additional anthologies

00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:08.170
to complete the BIBFRAME used as
core, as a heart of the project.

00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:13.400
Why we focus on ADA linked
up in that and BIBFRAME

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:20.260
because if you think this
guideline serve format model

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:24.360
at all related to
exactly the same model,

00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:27.560
that is an entity
relationship model.

00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:30.980
So, had in mind in
any case the entities

00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:33.760
and the relationship
between them.

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:40.530
So, also this type of a cultural
environment has something

00:17:40.530 --> 00:17:42.140
in common.

00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:46.030
And so I can try to share you,

00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:49.280
with you the process
overview of SHARE-VDE.

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:52.410
In this picture is,
summarizes some

00:17:52.410 --> 00:17:55.370
of important steps
of the project.

00:17:55.370 --> 00:18:01.530
Starting from the left, where
we indicated the different types

00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:06.810
and different format of data
records, not only MARC 21

00:18:06.810 --> 00:18:12.110
but other family of
MARC or rather formats

00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:15.090
and not specifically MARC.

00:18:15.090 --> 00:18:18.030
The record that a
worker have handled

00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:22.630
and using two different
processes, the main processes,

00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:27.540
of course, is similar this
core process, but is a lot

00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:36.600
of algorithms to identify,
similarity in heading,

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:42.050
for example, and to find the
similarity in the records

00:18:42.050 --> 00:18:44.760
and so on, and the Authify.

00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:48.590
The Authify is important because
it's a tool; it's a process

00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:53.070
that makes use of external
sources such as the Library

00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:57.030
of Congress's subject
heading, the NAF, ISNI Library

00:18:57.030 --> 00:19:01.990
of Congress Authority file and
son on to reach information

00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:06.710
and to simplify the
classification process.

00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:09.570
So, both processes,
the similarity score

00:19:09.570 --> 00:19:13.510
and Authify produce
an entity detection

00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:17.960
to identify specifically
each entity that is present

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:22.630
in a description, the enrichment
of information with the URIs

00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:27.190
but also with additional
attributes in different format

00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:30.510
and the reconciliation
classification process.

00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:35.550
That is really the
key concept we hope,

00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:37.860
of course, of our project.

00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:43.920
So, starting from this
output, we produce a database

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:48.980
of relationship because as
you know MARC records are full

00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:52.600
of relationships, not
clearly expressed,

00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:58.390
but each record presents full
relationships between entities.

00:19:58.390 --> 00:20:02.280
So, we reported and we
are creating a database

00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:05.900
of relationships, a
knowledge base of clusters

00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:07.790
because of the clusterization

00:20:07.790 --> 00:20:11.620
and the reconciliation
process produce a lot

00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:15.290
of relationship between,
for example, body and form

00:20:15.290 --> 00:20:21.160
to identify a name, a person,
and go through the Lodify

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:25.060
that is the commercial
tool we produce.

00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:27.850
We release a record, the data,

00:20:27.850 --> 00:20:31.430
in RDF to be published
autonomously by library

00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:36.190
or to be published in
the SHARE-VDE portal.

00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:39.340
So, some focus on
some processes.

00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:42.430
We start usually from
authority records.

00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:46.590
In fact, as Michele told, we
receive authority records not

00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:51.850
from all libraries but from
libraries who manage this kind,

00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:57.610
type of record, and we manage
authority records using the

00:20:57.610 --> 00:21:01.990
similarity score and
Authify tool samples.

00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:07.090
We use a clusters knowledge
base as a bridge to relate

00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:11.400
and to save and store some
information that we need.

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:16.600
For example, all the variant
form of a heading of the person,

00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:19.310
and we produce the
class and knowledge base

00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:22.490
in RDF, link it up in data.

00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:25.840
The second step is manage
the bibliographic records.

00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:30.190
So, the bibliographic record
use, again, the similarity score

00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:37.510
and the Authify tools and
enrich the Postgress database.

00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:41.980
And finally, we produce
a MARC enriched record.

00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:46.500
So, MARC enriched with the URIs
coming from different sources,

00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:52.300
and the process 2, we start
from the clusters knowledge base

00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:57.410
to convert the record
using the Lodify

00:21:57.410 --> 00:22:00.160
and to store it in
a Triplestore.

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:02.510
We mention here Blazegraph
that is

00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:04.360
in Open Source Triplestore even

00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:07.950
if we are considering other
solutions more powerful

00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:09.250
than Blazegraph.

00:22:09.250 --> 00:22:13.000
But in any case the important is
the concept of the Triplestore.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:18.720
And the second one, we publish
the class that knowledge base.

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:22.440
We produce and publish
knowledge base and a second one

00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:26.910
of the bibliographic record that
pass through the similar process

00:22:26.910 --> 00:22:33.120
and Lodify, the Triplestore,
and we produce each dataset

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:38.580
for each library related to
the class of knowledge base.

00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:41.620
I always try to explain
after this sense,

00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:46.060
the sense of this relation,
and we produce also the MARC

00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:49.690
and reach the in a [inaudible]
format or other format.

00:22:49.690 --> 00:22:55.070
So, just to give you a very
brief idea of our technology,

00:22:55.070 --> 00:22:59.870
as you can see, the class
assembly base is the heart

00:22:59.870 --> 00:23:04.010
of the project because we think
that is the power of the project

00:23:04.010 --> 00:23:07.190
to have the entity,
the conciliated

00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:10.240
and perfectly identified.

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:15.320
And we now are working
in a new function

00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:19.440
to create a new cluster starting
from the already existent,

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:23.290
but we will explain this
at the end of presentation.

00:23:23.290 --> 00:23:28.500
And just a brief look
to our technology,

00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:32.400
we try to put together
different type of technology

00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:38.470
because what the Triplestore
can do well is something but not

00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:43.880
so well as a relational
database or not so well

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:47.710
as an immersive index
such as SOLR.

00:23:47.710 --> 00:23:51.530
So, we try to put together
all this type of technologies

00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:56.970
to use the best of each of
them and to put together.

00:23:56.970 --> 00:24:00.560
So, I tried to explain to you
the Entity Identification,

00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:03.500
Reconciliation, and Data
Enrichment processes.

00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:09.960
So, of course, I will jump
this slide about the someone

00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:15.400
of you probably never have seen,
but our first question is how

00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:20.250
to identify an entity,
starting from a standard record

00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:24.840
or a standard description, and
the identification question,

00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:28.750
problem, is something
that is for all persons,

00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:33.100
all people in the world and
for all type of information.

00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:35.160
So, in this case,
in this picture,

00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:38.770
you can see different
version, different picture

00:24:38.770 --> 00:24:42.120
of the same people, Albert
Camus of the same person,

00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:47.400
Albert Camus, and each of
these representation is a valid

00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:49.160
representation of him.

00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:54.020
It's not something that
is more real than another.

00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:56.260
All the representations
are valid

00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:59.440
that represent the same
person, Albert Camus.

00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:02.900
So, in our process, we try
to identify Albert Camus

00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:06.870
as a person, as a real
world object in the world,

00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:11.640
as a real person and to
give him an identification,

00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:14.450
a unique identification
but using

00:25:14.450 --> 00:25:18.590
in the same type the unique
identification, okay, each,

00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:22.910
that each project in the work
assigned to the same person,

00:25:22.910 --> 00:25:26.550
to put together information
for the exactly

00:25:26.550 --> 00:25:30.480
and uniquely person
that is Albert Camus.

00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:34.320
But as I told you, the
importance of identification

00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:37.870
in this, not only in the
cataloging tradition,

00:25:37.870 --> 00:25:43.320
is something that is related to
all people and the inner world.

00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:47.520
For example, this has
two pictures taken

00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:51.400
at the City Lights
Bookstore in San Francisco

00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:58.520
where a door is expressly
indicated with a note,

00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:01.850
I am a Door, or Corporations
are not People.

00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:07.820
So, something, the [inaudible]
identified perfectly the

00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:12.070
entities of something that
is related to all the world.

00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:18.810
So, with the online presence
of different catalogs

00:26:18.810 --> 00:26:24.400
and authority files that are
available in the various formats

00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:31.050
and various, following various
guidelines and in open mode.

00:26:31.050 --> 00:26:34.710
Also the concept of
authority control

00:26:34.710 --> 00:26:39.370
or of union catalog
evolved into the grouping

00:26:39.370 --> 00:26:42.020
of an entity's identifying
attributes

00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:44.030
from different sources.

00:26:44.030 --> 00:26:49.640
And this process is best known
as reconciliation and consists

00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:53.410
in creating a cluster,
a group of data,

00:26:53.410 --> 00:26:56.460
that all refer to
the same entity.

00:26:56.460 --> 00:27:01.100
And so, we start
exactly from the record

00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:04.550
that is our tradition
in cataloging.

00:27:04.550 --> 00:27:10.740
We start from a record to
arrive to identify each entity

00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:13.300
that is present in a record.

00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:19.740
And for example, just to give
you some brief ideas about this,

00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:23.600
we can define the drive
[inaudible] from a record.

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:28.510
We can derive when
we have, when we can.

00:27:28.510 --> 00:27:32.050
Of course, a work
from a MARC record is

00:27:32.050 --> 00:27:35.470
such that they probably
shared the attributes

00:27:35.470 --> 00:27:38.120
to identify an instance
and so on.

00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:43.470
So, we try to identify
each entity that is defined

00:27:43.470 --> 00:27:45.830
and record it in a record.

00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:49.000
But as you know, for
each of these entities,

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.640
we can have a different
expression,

00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:55.110
different description,
and different languages.

00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:57.510
So, you're following
different rules.

00:27:57.510 --> 00:28:04.060
So, we need to put together this
body and form, consider them

00:28:04.060 --> 00:28:07.670
as different attributes
of the same entity.

00:28:07.670 --> 00:28:13.330
And for these, we thought
about a shared project

00:28:13.330 --> 00:28:17.220
to put together information
coming from different sources

00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:20.060
and to perfectly
identify entities

00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:21.890
and put them in relationship.

00:28:21.890 --> 00:28:26.270
So, bring together and
make available data

00:28:26.270 --> 00:28:28.650
from different sources in a way

00:28:28.650 --> 00:28:32.350
that we can consider
a democratic way

00:28:32.350 --> 00:28:37.090
so that doesn't exist, the
one form that is the best

00:28:37.090 --> 00:28:41.030
for the world, but each
character, each person think

00:28:41.030 --> 00:28:44.040
that is the best for himself.

00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:48.100
And so, we try to identify
the entity in question,

00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:52.700
and this is the base of
our SHARE-VDE project.

00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:58.990
So, starting from traditional
record before and after RDA,

00:28:58.990 --> 00:29:03.530
and we notice, of course, that
some important differences

00:29:03.530 --> 00:29:07.400
in converting data
before and after RDA,

00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:11.110
but we need to convert
all data that we have.

00:29:11.110 --> 00:29:16.660
So, we finally try to be able
to identify, for example,

00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:19.680
a work with its relationship.

00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:24.340
So, a work related to subjects
that are managed and work

00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:28.060
with the creator, with the
publications and so on.

00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:33.800
Or we can, we find, we
define, for example, a subject,

00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:37.850
the Thomas Mann in this case
as a subject or of something.

00:29:37.850 --> 00:29:41.820
All books that will
speak about Thomas Mann,

00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:49.830
all we hope we will be able to
define and to find the publisher

00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:52.930
and know its relationship.

00:29:52.930 --> 00:29:57.020
For example, [inaudible]
in a relation with places,

00:29:57.020 --> 00:30:03.350
with other forms that are
related to the same publisher,

00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:08.060
the best some of the people who
published with this publisher,

00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:11.040
the subject and so on.

00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:16.780
Or this is an example of
clusterization and, for example,

00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:19.660
an example of a collaboration
and sharing.

00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:23.790
So, this is the result
for Antonio Vivaldi

00:30:23.790 --> 00:30:29.510
of all forms coming from the
authority, local authority file,

00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:33.700
all forms coming from VIAF
project, all forms coming

00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:38.910
from cross reference taken
from authority record,

00:30:38.910 --> 00:30:42.450
or probably also the
forms that are used

00:30:42.450 --> 00:30:43.800
in bibliographical record

00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:47.220
and that doesn't
match with authority.

00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:51.990
Because we can imagine that all
these forms are used by someone

00:30:51.990 --> 00:30:55.790
to search an entity and
to define an entity.

00:30:55.790 --> 00:31:00.910
And so, this is an example of
Work/Instances reconciliation.

00:31:00.910 --> 00:31:05.210
This is a work of Vivaldi
Cimento dell'armonia e

00:31:05.210 --> 00:31:09.160
dell-inventione, and
all possible instances.

00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:13.420
So, a different title to
identify an instance related

00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:18.250
to the same work, to the
same intellectual production

00:31:18.250 --> 00:31:22.420
of a person or, for
example, the instance,

00:31:22.420 --> 00:31:25.880
a different instance is
present in different libraries,

00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:30.440
so the same instance that is
present in different libraries

00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:32.780
and put together in one group

00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:38.920
so that the end user can simply
define and find the information

00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:41.850
and choose what he needs.

00:31:41.850 --> 00:31:47.260
So, how reconciliation
and enrichment can work.

00:31:47.260 --> 00:31:52.180
We work using usually
two different processes.

00:31:52.180 --> 00:31:56.010
One is an automated process,

00:31:56.010 --> 00:31:59.530
and the second one is a manual
process because, as you know,

00:31:59.530 --> 00:32:02.930
Casalini produce records
for different libraries

00:32:02.930 --> 00:32:06.180
so has the opportunity to work

00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:09.210
on the records during
the production.

00:32:09.210 --> 00:32:11.530
Of course, taking
in consideration

00:32:11.530 --> 00:32:17.080
that automated process produce
a high level of reconciliation

00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:21.630
and clusterization but a low
level of results validation

00:32:21.630 --> 00:32:23.920
because are automated processes.

00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:28.480
And contrary, manual
processes produce a low level

00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:32.290
of reconciliation and
clustering and a high level

00:32:32.290 --> 00:32:33.590
of results validation.

00:32:33.590 --> 00:32:37.260
So, we think that to put
together will produce the

00:32:37.260 --> 00:32:39.570
best result.

00:32:39.570 --> 00:32:45.410
And this is again the
same picture than before

00:32:45.410 --> 00:32:48.680
to identify automated
reconciliation

00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:50.370
and enrichment process.

00:32:50.370 --> 00:32:55.610
So, using in this case,
Antonio Vivaldi as an entity

00:32:55.610 --> 00:33:00.510
and reaching this entity
with all the forms coming

00:33:00.510 --> 00:33:03.840
from different projects
and so on.

00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:09.080
And for this process, the heart
of the process is Authify.

00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:13.540
I'll try to explain to you
briefly what is Authify,

00:33:13.540 --> 00:33:15.500
a general description.

00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:20.890
Authify is a RESTful module
that offers several search

00:33:20.890 --> 00:33:23.430
and detection services.

00:33:23.430 --> 00:33:27.230
The project started
at the very beginning

00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:30.690
for overcoming some limitation

00:33:30.690 --> 00:33:35.410
in using the public
VIAF Web API.

00:33:35.410 --> 00:33:41.510
We started the project using
the API available in VIAF but,

00:33:41.510 --> 00:33:45.310
of course, VIAF, being
a public project,

00:33:45.310 --> 00:33:49.760
doesn't allow a massive
invocation of its API,

00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:56.520
while we need to manage more
than 100 million of record

00:33:56.520 --> 00:33:57.950
for this type of project.

00:33:57.950 --> 00:34:02.880
So, we discovered, we found
that this type of views

00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:09.570
of Web API was not
feasible, and so we tried

00:34:09.570 --> 00:34:11.800
to find a different way.

00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:15.580
So, we tried to use
them for VIAF

00:34:15.580 --> 00:34:19.360
and to implement a local power,

00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:26.060
the search engine,
to use this source.

00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:29.320
And of course, this was
just the first model,

00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:31.710
but in the time we acted,

00:34:31.710 --> 00:34:36.250
a lot of different sources
is in the same tool.

00:34:36.250 --> 00:34:43.180
So, how to file our first
list of different services,

00:34:43.180 --> 00:34:47.540
the class search services, for
example, the Authify classes

00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:53.380
of services provides a full text
search service among the names

00:34:53.380 --> 00:34:55.630
and works clusters.

00:34:55.630 --> 00:34:59.540
The search Web API
uses, behind the scenes,

00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:04.320
an "invisible queries" approach
in order to or to try to,

00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:09.740
of course, find a match, as
much precise as possible,

00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:12.160
within the managed clusters.

00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:15.480
The invisible queries
approach allows

00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:18.600
to make everything
transparent to the caller.

00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:22.550
So, on top of a single
search request,

00:35:22.550 --> 00:35:27.350
the system executes a chain
of different search strategies

00:35:27.350 --> 00:35:30.690
with different priority,
and the first match

00:35:30.690 --> 00:35:34.360
that produces a result
will populate the response

00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:36.120
that will be returned.

00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:38.360
For debugging purposes,

00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:42.650
the response will also
include the matching strategies

00:35:42.650 --> 00:35:46.470
that produced the results,
so the technician can check

00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:49.980
and can use and can
improve the search method.

00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:55.120
The system has been built
with extensibility in mind

00:35:55.120 --> 00:35:58.800
as to manage different
sources and different format

00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:00.960
and adding new services.

00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:05.040
So, dimension of the chain
is fully configurable

00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:07.220
by the project manager.

00:36:07.220 --> 00:36:10.360
For instance, here is
a brief description

00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:14.160
of the current configuration
when searching name cluster.

00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:17.620
For example, we can search
in subfield matching,

00:36:17.620 --> 00:36:22.330
so we can define
what kind of subfield

00:36:22.330 --> 00:36:25.770
of each tag we can
use in searching.

00:36:25.770 --> 00:36:30.660
Or we can input heading exact
match before the first searching

00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:31.960
is okay.

00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:36.400
If we try to find something that
exactly match with my heading,

00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:39.360
or we pass it to a
full text search.

00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:41.770
If exact match is not possible,

00:36:41.770 --> 00:36:46.530
then the regular full text
search is executed with things

00:36:46.530 --> 00:36:51.030
like a proximity search for
names and for other entities.

00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:58.110
As last chance, the system
executes a search by "initials"

00:36:58.110 --> 00:37:01.600
in order to find a valid
match in those cases

00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:05.580
when the input string,
or the indexed heading,

00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:09.130
contains the name
in its short forms,

00:37:09.130 --> 00:37:15.550
and that mean you use usually
the initials to identify person.

00:37:15.550 --> 00:37:17.920
And so in this case,
we try to find

00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:22.790
and to identify the person
also using the initial of name.

00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:29.550
And so, this is a type of a
response where the system finds

00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:33.580
that Meyer, Bertrand is
exactly the same entity

00:37:33.580 --> 00:37:39.750
that Bertrand Meyer, or Meyer,
Bertrand with or without dates.

00:37:39.750 --> 00:37:43.600
But another service is
important in Authify is the

00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:45.500
"relator term detection."

00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:53.220
Starting from a MARC record,
the system produces an analysis

00:37:53.220 --> 00:37:57.460
of tags that contain a
name and, for each of them,

00:37:57.460 --> 00:38:02.190
tries to figure out, using the
statement of responsibility

00:38:02.190 --> 00:38:06.110
of the input record, but using
in addition, for example,

00:38:06.110 --> 00:38:11.830
field for notes such as
the content notes and some,

00:38:11.830 --> 00:38:14.460
and what is the corresponding
rule

00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:18.640
within the work represented
by the given record?

00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:23.350
So, for instance, on top
of the following input,

00:38:23.350 --> 00:38:28.160
you can see here a
declaration of responsibility

00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:31.880
with two authors, two creators,

00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:36.460
and Prefazione all'edizione
italiana di G. Biorci

00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:42.940
and the three headings
reported in this record.

00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:47.840
So, in this case, the relator
term detection was able

00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:53.590
to identify two authors
for the same work,

00:38:53.590 --> 00:38:58.620
and someone as having
an additional role

00:38:58.620 --> 00:39:00.880
and not as co-authors.

00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:04.400
And in this case,
we used the author,

00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:09.350
that is an unclassified
role, when we are not able

00:39:09.350 --> 00:39:11.600
to perfectly identify the role.

00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:13.300
What kind of role?

00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:17.040
But declaring of,
okay, not the role,

00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:22.310
not the co-author is the
first step to identify.

00:39:22.310 --> 00:39:28.000
And this is another example of
detection, entity detection,

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:34.070
with analyzing this statement
From Chaucer to the present,

00:39:34.070 --> 00:39:37.600
John Stephens and
Ruth Waterhouse,

00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:44.060
and having this field without
a subfield e or a subfield 4,

00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:50.330
and in this case, the Authify
detect response, identify either

00:39:50.330 --> 00:39:56.480
as an author and as some,
okay, as an author, yes.

00:39:56.480 --> 00:40:03.680
And this is another example,
edited and introduced by,

00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:08.030
and in this case,
this is the response,

00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:12.600
and in this case the
tool identified perfectly

00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:18.040
that Lena Jayyusi is
an editor in this case.

00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:24.260
Of course, we usually can
find also critical case.

00:40:24.260 --> 00:40:27.130
See, in this case,
Cedizioine anastatica,

00:40:27.130 --> 00:40:32.180
introduzione e appendice a cura
di; con la collaborizione di.

00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:39.650
So, very and many roles, many
roles for the same person.

00:40:39.650 --> 00:40:44.750
So, in this case, we prefer
now to define, okay, other.

00:40:44.750 --> 00:40:47.310
So, this makes possible
to a person

00:40:47.310 --> 00:40:50.840
to check the record
using this response

00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:53.670
and to correct or to input.

00:40:53.670 --> 00:40:57.700
Of course, we are trying to
improve the knowledge base

00:40:57.700 --> 00:41:02.730
with all expressions present
in responsibility coming

00:41:02.730 --> 00:41:04.290
from different languages.

00:41:04.290 --> 00:41:09.020
So, to have a more and more
increased knowledge base and,

00:41:09.020 --> 00:41:13.350
of course, we need to do
some step again to arrive

00:41:13.350 --> 00:41:17.710
to something of perfect
or perfectly working.

00:41:17.710 --> 00:41:22.340
So, I show you a brief
name cluster process,

00:41:22.340 --> 00:41:24.630
simply name cluster process.

00:41:24.630 --> 00:41:29.510
In this case, we have a form
coming from authority record

00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:33.550
from Jose de Lucio and
different forms coming

00:41:33.550 --> 00:41:37.740
from different bibliographic
record, and the similarity score

00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:42.730
in Authify, Identify, this
variant form as the form related

00:41:42.730 --> 00:41:46.200
to the same person,
assigns also a weight,

00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:53.650
a weight that is important
in issuing a term to accept

00:41:53.650 --> 00:41:56.420
or not accept the class.

00:41:56.420 --> 00:41:59.920
So, in the massive
cluster processes,

00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:06.460
we try to give you
the main processes,

00:42:06.460 --> 00:42:09.890
the things the authority
headings, analysis and process

00:42:09.890 --> 00:42:12.100
in Postgres, the first step.

00:42:12.100 --> 00:42:13.400
The data enrichment

00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:16.010
with external sources
are very important

00:42:16.010 --> 00:42:20.920
that we can use international
project already available

00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:23.140
to identify the entity.

00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:27.800
The MARC bibliographic process;
the entity detection process,

00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:31.190
the name heading-to-Authority
name association,

00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:38.260
but because it's not so
used; also, general use,

00:42:38.260 --> 00:42:40.140
use the Authority authors

00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:42.550
from all similar
bibliographic records.

00:42:42.550 --> 00:42:47.000
Not all libraries have
an Authority system,

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:50.370
and the name heading to vary
and the name association

00:42:50.370 --> 00:42:54.440
and the clusters check, it
exists and it doesn't exist,

00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:56.610
it creates a new cluster.

00:42:56.610 --> 00:43:00.050
But we have also
a manual process,

00:43:00.050 --> 00:43:04.630
and we try to follow
the PCC directives

00:43:04.630 --> 00:43:10.310
because PCC identifies and
addresses policy issues

00:43:10.310 --> 00:43:16.650
on the use of identifiers in
MARC, and many items are now

00:43:16.650 --> 00:43:19.540
in discussion into
the PCC growth.

00:43:19.540 --> 00:43:22.130
For example, developing
guidelines

00:43:22.130 --> 00:43:25.130
to include identifiers
in MARC bibliographic

00:43:25.130 --> 00:43:29.200
and authority records; the
use of multiple identifiers

00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:32.790
for the same entity; how to
use a multiple identifier;

00:43:32.790 --> 00:43:34.320
determining the entities

00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:37.140
for which identifiers
should be provided

00:43:37.140 --> 00:43:39.270
in an initial implementation;

00:43:39.270 --> 00:43:43.320
and identifying automated
methods for populating

00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:48.920
and maintaining new and existing
records with identifiers.

00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:52.790
But also in this case, the
importance of identification

00:43:52.790 --> 00:43:57.230
and detection in the Semantic
Web to enrich a MARC record

00:43:57.230 --> 00:44:02.740
with URIs, Casalini Libri uses
the "URI MANAGEMENT SYSTEM"

00:44:02.740 --> 00:44:07.050
that is included into the
cataloging module of OLISuite;

00:44:07.050 --> 00:44:10.420
that is the cataloging
module developed by @CULTt

00:44:10.420 --> 00:44:12.770
and then used in Casalini.

00:44:12.770 --> 00:44:16.700
This also simplifies the
reconciliation of varying forms

00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:19.760
of the same entry
with the development

00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:23.370
of detection procedures
for entity identification

00:44:23.370 --> 00:44:25.410
and the conversion to BIBFRAME.

00:44:25.410 --> 00:44:29.310
So, the URI MANAGEMENT
SYSTEM allows the management

00:44:29.310 --> 00:44:35.080
of multiple identifiers for
each access point or heading;

00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:39.680
the use of external sources
with API and web services,

00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:45.850
or using in some cases the dump
of data; and associate heading

00:44:45.850 --> 00:44:50.800
with the URIs that identify
it in each of the projects.

00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:54.590
But this is just an example
of the URI Management System

00:44:54.590 --> 00:44:59.800
in OLISuite where the cataloger
can choose for each heading,

00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:06.350
define a URI System, and
it can add, check, modify,

00:45:06.350 --> 00:45:11.420
or delete a URI coming from
different sources or can choose,

00:45:11.420 --> 00:45:15.150
can search in different
sources and search

00:45:15.150 --> 00:45:21.190
and check the preferred
URI for this heading.

00:45:21.190 --> 00:45:25.570
But why multiple
identifiers associated

00:45:25.570 --> 00:45:28.750
with the same heading
or access point?

00:45:28.750 --> 00:45:32.880
First of all, because
Casalini produce records

00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:37.430
for many libraries, and each
library is defined and preferred

00:45:37.430 --> 00:45:42.940
in the form of URI, preferred
the source or a different order

00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:45.360
in having different URI.

00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:49.530
So, Casalini starting
from the same record has

00:45:49.530 --> 00:45:53.220
to produce a different
record as final output

00:45:53.220 --> 00:45:54.690
for different libraries.

00:45:54.690 --> 00:46:00.610
So, in this case, we realize
the system that makes possible

00:46:00.610 --> 00:46:06.090
to assign URI not in
original in the MARC record

00:46:06.090 --> 00:46:10.350
but in a different table
with different system.

00:46:10.350 --> 00:46:12.730
And so, for each library,

00:46:12.730 --> 00:46:16.660
Casalini can choose how
many URIs to make available

00:46:16.660 --> 00:46:20.840
for each heading; how to
associate them with the heading;

00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:26.210
how to show them in relation to
data use and formats, following,

00:46:26.210 --> 00:46:30.660
of course, the preferences
declared by each library.

00:46:30.660 --> 00:46:36.390
And so the cataloging
system is related and linked

00:46:36.390 --> 00:46:41.200
to the Adempiere system, and
that is an EFP that use Casalini

00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:44.470
to manage all this preferences

00:46:44.470 --> 00:46:46.580
and the profile,
customer profile.

00:46:46.580 --> 00:46:49.970
The most important section
is the customer profile.

00:46:49.970 --> 00:46:53.430
So, this is, for example,
the customer profile

00:46:53.430 --> 00:46:57.390
for Harvard College
Library with a mapping URI,

00:46:57.390 --> 00:47:00.710
and each library can
define the mapping

00:47:00.710 --> 00:47:03.180
for each time they
can define, okay,

00:47:03.180 --> 00:47:07.110
what is the preferred
URI if it exists?

00:47:07.110 --> 00:47:13.760
In this case, for example,
uno1, sorry, 1 is for Italian.

00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:17.680
Okay. One is for
ISNI, 2 is for VIAF,

00:47:17.680 --> 00:47:20.500
3 is for Library of
Congress and NAF.

00:47:20.500 --> 00:47:25.110
So, if he's in ISNI,
please put the ISNI URI.

00:47:25.110 --> 00:47:30.500
If it doesn't fix ISNI,
please put VIAF, and so on.

00:47:30.500 --> 00:47:33.260
And each library can
define a different mapping,

00:47:33.260 --> 00:47:38.520
so that we can produce and start
it from exactly the same record

00:47:38.520 --> 00:47:42.000
in that local database
to different record

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:45.120
with different URI
for each library.

00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:53.440
And of course, each library can
define how to receive this data.

00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:58.000
For example, as enrichment
in tag 100, the choosing

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:02.750
of the subfield; or for example,
as enrichment in Authority file,

00:48:02.750 --> 00:48:06.440
choose the perfect and the
correct type and so on.

00:48:06.440 --> 00:48:11.080
But of course, when we work
with URI with identifier,

00:48:11.080 --> 00:48:14.630
so we need to also think
about to manage them

00:48:14.630 --> 00:48:18.860
because when we publish our
data, enriched with URI,

00:48:18.860 --> 00:48:21.700
we are thinking that
other people,

00:48:21.700 --> 00:48:25.870
other projects make
use of our data.

00:48:25.870 --> 00:48:31.190
So, we need to provide something
that makes possible the use

00:48:31.190 --> 00:48:33.590
of this data in the future.

00:48:33.590 --> 00:48:38.020
And so, we thought
about a URI Registry.

00:48:38.020 --> 00:48:44.460
That is the history of each URI
when something changes in it,

00:48:44.460 --> 00:48:50.120
and the, for example, when
we reorganize the cluster

00:48:50.120 --> 00:48:53.220
because we discover
something that is not covered;

00:48:53.220 --> 00:48:56.970
for example, we put
together two person,

00:48:56.970 --> 00:48:58.970
two people in the same cluster,

00:48:58.970 --> 00:49:01.980
we discover that this
is not the same people,

00:49:01.980 --> 00:49:03.300
are two different people.

00:49:03.300 --> 00:49:08.930
So, we need to split the
cluster and assign a new URI

00:49:08.930 --> 00:49:10.540
for the second person.

00:49:10.540 --> 00:49:15.130
So, the URI just
reports on this changing.

00:49:15.130 --> 00:49:19.520
For example, the resource added
to cluster but also modified

00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:22.680
or removed from it;
the date of the update;

00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:26.270
the particular operation
performed and status

00:49:26.270 --> 00:49:29.020
of a new URI, for
example, is valid,

00:49:29.020 --> 00:49:33.240
or it is not still
valid, or the URI Aliases.

00:49:33.240 --> 00:49:38.080
This is, okay, use this URI
for this entity and so on.

00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:42.830
So, finally, we can start
the conversion in RDF and,

00:49:42.830 --> 00:49:45.390
in this case, in BIBFRAME.

00:49:45.390 --> 00:49:50.030
I don't give you the details
of Lodify, but just to explain

00:49:50.030 --> 00:49:54.300
that LODify is the
evolution of ALIADA,

00:49:54.300 --> 00:50:02.040
coming from a European project
that is a conversion tool.

00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:03.820
ALIADA is transparent.

00:50:03.820 --> 00:50:08.900
It can manage as LODify
different ontologies,

00:50:08.900 --> 00:50:11.090
but LODify was the evolution

00:50:11.090 --> 00:50:14.320
that we produce to
manage BIBFRAME.

00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:20.060
So, the importance of LODify
gives you just a particular

00:50:20.060 --> 00:50:22.570
piece, the possibility to work

00:50:22.570 --> 00:50:26.570
with atomic pieces,
atomic processors.

00:50:26.570 --> 00:50:31.660
This makes possible to
work with a small part

00:50:31.660 --> 00:50:34.280
of the overall task,
and this means

00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:39.420
that you can change the font
for each specific piece,

00:50:39.420 --> 00:50:44.220
a specific class of
property of an ontology

00:50:44.220 --> 00:50:45.840
or to change and so on.

00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:49.390
So, this makes the
tools very elastic

00:50:49.390 --> 00:50:53.020
and very powerful
and easy to manage.

00:50:53.020 --> 00:50:55.080
This is a conversion template

00:50:55.080 --> 00:50:59.470
because LODify converts each
incoming record by means

00:50:59.470 --> 00:51:01.380
of Conversion templates,

00:51:01.380 --> 00:51:06.330
and each template associates
a MARC record belonging

00:51:06.330 --> 00:51:12.040
to the incoming datasteam with a
set of rules associated with one

00:51:12.040 --> 00:51:16.050
or more ontologies to
produce the final session.

00:51:16.050 --> 00:51:21.010
And finally, the
trust and provenance

00:51:21.010 --> 00:51:23.350
because when you
publish your data,

00:51:23.350 --> 00:51:27.280
or when you put together data
coming from different sources,

00:51:27.280 --> 00:51:30.000
we need to think
about the provenance

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:31.730
of your letter, the quality.

00:51:31.730 --> 00:51:34.960
You need to assure the
quality of your data,

00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:39.130
and you need guarantee the
accuracy of this information.

00:51:39.130 --> 00:51:45.280
So, we use the concept of
provenance that is the origin,

00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:49.740
the authorship of an
information to extend

00:51:49.740 --> 00:51:54.540
and to give trust
about information.

00:51:54.540 --> 00:51:57.800
So, creating a link
between information

00:51:57.800 --> 00:52:02.270
and its source has become
essential for the purpose

00:52:02.270 --> 00:52:06.090
of guaranteeing the authority
of the information itself.

00:52:06.090 --> 00:52:10.140
If so the triple
become a quadruple

00:52:10.140 --> 00:52:15.580
because we add the third mode of
source to the claim that, okay,

00:52:15.580 --> 00:52:18.560
it's not something that
is a universal value,

00:52:18.560 --> 00:52:24.060
but someone says that this
is blue, this is this color,

00:52:24.060 --> 00:52:27.940
this is the name, and so on.

00:52:27.940 --> 00:52:35.030
Now, we go in the SHARE-VDE
Phase 2 deliverables that,

00:52:35.030 --> 00:52:40.530
as Michele told you, was
finalized and finished,

00:52:40.530 --> 00:52:44.440
more or less, in the same
way of the last year.

00:52:44.440 --> 00:52:49.440
We have totally something
else, but we are more ready,

00:52:49.440 --> 00:52:54.280
and so we have four
different deliverables.

00:52:54.280 --> 00:52:59.920
The deliverable 1 is the
datasets in BIBFRAME 2.0

00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:05.930
of the entire catalog of each
institution with the triples

00:53:05.930 --> 00:53:11.900
or "tuples" derived directly
from the MARC records,

00:53:11.900 --> 00:53:16.420
delivered both as triples and
as quadruples with the addition

00:53:16.420 --> 00:53:19.900
of the provenance and
with SHARE-VDE URIs.

00:53:19.900 --> 00:53:25.090
This first deliverable
is strictly related

00:53:25.090 --> 00:53:26.400
to Deliverable 2.

00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:32.090
It is the knowledge base of
clusters accessible in RDF,

00:53:32.090 --> 00:53:36.390
and we think it is the
other value of the project

00:53:36.390 --> 00:53:43.040
because each library can receive
their own data but all related

00:53:43.040 --> 00:53:47.360
to the same knowledge base
to demonstrate also the power

00:53:47.360 --> 00:53:52.120
of sharing data and of
a cooperating project.

00:53:52.120 --> 00:53:56.490
The Delivery 3 is more
autonomous, is independent

00:53:56.490 --> 00:53:59.910
by the knowledge base,
is out of [inaudible]

00:53:59.910 --> 00:54:07.530
and in the Deliverable
3, you will have the URIs

00:54:07.530 --> 00:54:09.750
from external sources.

00:54:09.750 --> 00:54:14.230
So, not the Shelby D URI but
the international definition

00:54:14.230 --> 00:54:15.530
of URIs.

00:54:15.530 --> 00:54:18.420
So, each library can
use Deliverable 3

00:54:18.420 --> 00:54:21.330
to publish their own
data autonomously

00:54:21.330 --> 00:54:24.350
with respect to other libraries.

00:54:24.350 --> 00:54:27.980
And Deliverable 4 is
the MARC 21 records

00:54:27.980 --> 00:54:31.270
for each institution
enriched with URIs.

00:54:31.270 --> 00:54:36.160
So, this is a version
of this deliverable

00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:38.630
to the most [inaudible]
that Deliverable 1

00:54:38.630 --> 00:54:43.280
and 2 are strictly related
to, and Deliverable 3

00:54:43.280 --> 00:54:46.930
and 4 are autonomous,
and each of,

00:54:46.930 --> 00:54:50.760
each library can
use autonomously.

00:54:50.760 --> 00:54:56.260
What we have now with
BIBFRAME, BIBFRAME is for us a,

00:54:56.260 --> 00:55:03.160
we are a sort of
pioneer project.

00:55:03.160 --> 00:55:10.670
So, each day we receive news,
new information upgrade; so,

00:55:10.670 --> 00:55:13.310
it's not so easy to
follow the project.

00:55:13.310 --> 00:55:15.200
But it's a very, very,

00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:20.490
very interesting special
phase of our project.

00:55:20.490 --> 00:55:26.400
Now, we are managing the
extension of the Library

00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:31.980
of Congress to perfect
manage in MARC 21 tags,

00:55:31.980 --> 00:55:39.180
and we underline the class
that we already managed

00:55:39.180 --> 00:55:43.860
in our state-of-the-art, but
we will continue, of course,

00:55:43.860 --> 00:55:48.050
each day to include
additional classes and so on.

00:55:48.050 --> 00:55:52.110
So, this is an example,
Deliverable 1,

00:55:52.110 --> 00:55:59.450
the RDF conversion,
and see here the use

00:55:59.450 --> 00:56:02.020
of LC vocabulary extension.

00:56:02.020 --> 00:56:06.560
So, to manage some
specific information,

00:56:06.560 --> 00:56:11.790
this is the contents of the
record and the deliverable

00:56:11.790 --> 00:56:13.480
to the knowledge base cluster.

00:56:13.480 --> 00:56:19.540
I give you just an idea about
a clusterization process

00:56:19.540 --> 00:56:21.920
of "forename" heading type.

00:56:21.920 --> 00:56:28.520
See here an example, Bridget,
of Sweden, Saint, with a date.

00:56:28.520 --> 00:56:30.860
And so, this is an example

00:56:30.860 --> 00:56:34.690
of the algorithm to
identify a person.

00:56:34.690 --> 00:56:38.090
So, the selection of
interesting subfield,

00:56:38.090 --> 00:56:44.060
we start from the full
tags, and after we go back

00:56:44.060 --> 00:56:48.290
to find each piece
of information.

00:56:48.290 --> 00:56:51.550
The first step is the
normalization of string text

00:56:51.550 --> 00:56:54.350
without diacritics,
accents, and so on.

00:56:54.350 --> 00:56:59.400
So, this field becomes
this field because let all

00:56:59.400 --> 00:57:02.340
in upper case and search string

00:57:02.340 --> 00:57:05.690
into db variance form
and cross references.

00:57:05.690 --> 00:57:09.200
So, the fields become
something like this,

00:57:09.200 --> 00:57:13.250
and if the cluster found,
because we use this heading

00:57:13.250 --> 00:57:16.910
to match the string;
if no cluster found,

00:57:16.910 --> 00:57:21.420
the subfields will be analyzed
for comparing, for example,

00:57:21.420 --> 00:57:24.410
subfield a with other
existing forms;

00:57:24.410 --> 00:57:27.940
or comparing only the
numeric part of subfield d,

00:57:27.940 --> 00:57:34.390
having the same subfield a; or
comparing subfield c for "saint"

00:57:34.390 --> 00:57:39.740
or "santa" or other forms in
other languages and so on,

00:57:39.740 --> 00:57:42.800
to arrive finally to
identify the entity.

00:57:42.800 --> 00:57:47.870
And this produces the
knowledge base, and we use,

00:57:47.870 --> 00:57:51.220
as I told you before,
Postgres as a bridge.

00:57:51.220 --> 00:57:53.580
We don't publish
Postgres database.

00:57:53.580 --> 00:57:58.080
We will publish the class
assembly base in RDF

00:57:58.080 --> 00:58:01.050
but we use a lockout
at the base in Postgres

00:58:01.050 --> 00:58:04.490
because in some cases, the
relational database is able

00:58:04.490 --> 00:58:08.080
to do something that the DND
[inaudible] is not able to do.

00:58:08.080 --> 00:58:13.370
So, this is the final result
of all forms that we found

00:58:13.370 --> 00:58:18.050
in libraries for this
entity, and we reported these

00:58:18.050 --> 00:58:22.010
in Postgres, and finally
the results we published

00:58:22.010 --> 00:58:26.300
on this form in a
portal because the goal

00:58:26.300 --> 00:58:29.390
for this project is having
a [inaudible] library

00:58:29.390 --> 00:58:33.630
and using BIBFRAME and new
technology, but in helping,

00:58:33.630 --> 00:58:36.740
of course, end user and
use this information

00:58:36.740 --> 00:58:42.520
to improve the search engine
experience and the use of data.

00:58:42.520 --> 00:58:47.400
So, this is another complement
to produce a deliverable

00:58:47.400 --> 00:58:51.860
and is a table for external
sources, a sort of map

00:58:51.860 --> 00:58:55.600
of all external sources
that we use

00:58:55.600 --> 00:58:59.620
to improve the record
with the URIs.

00:58:59.620 --> 00:59:02.000
And of course, each
library can select

00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:05.210
and choose the preferred
sources.

00:59:05.210 --> 00:59:08.770
And so, we arrive to
the enriched MARC 21.

00:59:08.770 --> 00:59:10.450
This is the original record,

00:59:10.450 --> 00:59:13.340
and we [inaudible]
enriched with the URI.

00:59:13.340 --> 00:59:18.950
Of course, we have also in this
step, a lot of dubs [phonetic]

00:59:18.950 --> 00:59:25.050
that we try to solve with the
availability of Sally McCallum

00:59:25.050 --> 00:59:32.620
and this group who help us
in understanding what is hard

00:59:32.620 --> 00:59:35.300
to understand, and
also for MARC 21.

00:59:35.300 --> 00:59:40.870
For example, we have some labs
or if you use the subfield 0,

00:59:40.870 --> 00:59:44.010
subfield 1, to reach the record,

00:59:44.010 --> 00:59:48.200
what kind of source is the
best to use in what cases.

00:59:48.200 --> 00:59:50.330
So, it's interesting
this project

00:59:50.330 --> 00:59:52.660
because it gives
us the opportunity

00:59:52.660 --> 00:59:57.890
to share our thoughts with very
expert people, skilled people,

00:59:57.890 --> 01:00:01.230
and to improve our
knowledge about this.

01:00:01.230 --> 01:00:06.840
So, I ask Michele to
introduce the last three slides

01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:09.930
that is the possible
steps for the future.

01:00:13.250 --> 01:00:15.260
&gt;&gt; Michele Casalini:
We started last summer

01:00:15.260 --> 01:00:20.080
at ALA during a workshop
of SHARE-VDE

01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:27.230
to discuss preliminary what
a production phase could be,

01:00:27.230 --> 01:00:31.190
and it came immediately
out of it that

01:00:31.190 --> 01:00:33.760
and the scene is
very heterogeneous

01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:39.120
because the priorities are
also different from institution

01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:43.990
to institution, and there are,
of course, different workflows

01:00:43.990 --> 01:00:49.380
to cover the other aspects in
both directions in the sense

01:00:49.380 --> 01:00:54.550
from traditional
records into linked data.

01:00:54.550 --> 01:00:58.420
But then there are also, and
this will be more frequent

01:00:58.420 --> 01:01:01.610
in the coming future
data created

01:01:01.610 --> 01:01:05.790
with a BIBFRAME editor
originally that needs sometimes

01:01:05.790 --> 01:01:10.210
to be later converted because
of the operational systems

01:01:10.210 --> 01:01:12.640
in libraries still
need, and the need

01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:17.180
for a foreseeable long period
of time and MARC record

01:01:17.180 --> 01:01:21.350
to place orders to handle
a number of services.

01:01:21.350 --> 01:01:28.920
So, we started to work on a
list of candidate use cases,

01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:36.180
and we had a very important
meeting here on October 6th

01:01:36.180 --> 01:01:37.480
at the Library of Congress.

01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:43.480
We were very grateful that this
meeting could be hosted here,

01:01:43.480 --> 01:01:48.680
and where we analyzed
mostly the original

01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:52.760
and copy cataloging use cases.

01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:57.890
We will have, our next
meeting will be in Denver.

01:01:57.890 --> 01:02:02.560
And the next couple of
slides give some details

01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:05.360
about the original
and copy cataloging.

01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:09.410
Maybe we need also a new
name for copy cataloging

01:02:09.410 --> 01:02:14.590
and definition in the future.

01:02:14.590 --> 01:02:17.890
So, so far, the candidate
use cases

01:02:17.890 --> 01:02:24.960
for a production phase foresee
on one side the publication

01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:30.790
of the entire datasets
on a portal

01:02:30.790 --> 01:02:34.050
that should be no longer
a prototype, of course.

01:02:34.050 --> 01:02:41.650
With that and a batch or
automated data flows in order

01:02:41.650 --> 01:02:44.630
to allow libraries
to send the daily

01:02:44.630 --> 01:02:48.220
of the new data they
created in MARC

01:02:48.220 --> 01:02:52.700
or with BIBFRAME
editor and, of course,

01:02:52.700 --> 01:02:57.340
to receive back the data
reconciled, enriched,

01:02:57.340 --> 01:03:03.850
and with their preferences.

01:03:03.850 --> 01:03:11.400
At the same time, let's say,
considering this as the basis

01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:16.600
for a production phase, there
are a number of further steps

01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:20.960
and further use cases
that you see here listed

01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:24.760
as candidate Phase 3b.

01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:30.780
And before we move on with
some further details about two

01:03:30.780 --> 01:03:35.850
of these use cases, I would
like to join Tiziana's words

01:03:35.850 --> 01:03:40.530
that expressed deep
gratitude to Sally McCallum

01:03:40.530 --> 01:03:42.840
and the colleagues of
the Standards office

01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:47.570
because without many answers
that we received, I mean,

01:03:47.570 --> 01:03:51.040
what we have done would not
have been really possible.

01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:55.170
But let's go here in
some detail, Tiziana,

01:03:55.170 --> 01:03:58.300
in explaining this and
the next slide, please.

01:03:58.300 --> 01:03:59.600
&gt;&gt; Tiziana Posssemato:
This is, of course,

01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:01.950
something that we are
studying with the group,

01:04:01.950 --> 01:04:04.630
so I cannot answer in detail

01:04:04.630 --> 01:04:06.750
because we need to
define details.

01:04:06.750 --> 01:04:13.450
But the general idea is to make
the SHARE-VDE project something

01:04:13.450 --> 01:04:18.770
more than a publication layer,
more than a publication portal.

01:04:18.770 --> 01:04:21.450
But to make possible
that the richness

01:04:21.450 --> 01:04:29.170
of the project can become a
richness for libraries in using,

01:04:29.170 --> 01:04:32.340
for example, the
cluster knowledge base,

01:04:32.340 --> 01:04:35.060
during the cataloging
process, and so on.

01:04:35.060 --> 01:04:41.200
So, the first thing in use
cases, try to analyze the flow,

01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:49.890
a possible flow to that have the
SHARE-VDE project in the center

01:04:49.890 --> 01:04:57.750
and the possibility to use this
important powerful knowledge

01:04:57.750 --> 01:05:02.870
base of data to copy cataloging

01:05:02.870 --> 01:05:06.070
or to define the
carrier and holding.

01:05:06.070 --> 01:05:09.940
Okay, yes, a copy of this book,

01:05:09.940 --> 01:05:14.410
and I can report is using
the SHARE-VDE portal

01:05:14.410 --> 01:05:16.640
and the SHARE-VDE process.

01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:23.590
So, we are thinking to allow
the contribution by libraries

01:05:23.590 --> 01:05:28.600
to have something that is
useful in the cataloging process

01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:32.850
and a world that makes
use of this richness

01:05:32.850 --> 01:05:37.900
and exactly the same but with
different flows, of course,

01:05:37.900 --> 01:05:40.040
for the region of cataloging

01:05:40.040 --> 01:05:46.000
because this makes possible
the use of different tools;

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:51.550
for example, the tools
that the library will call

01:05:51.550 --> 01:05:57.970
on Congress propose for
creating or for editing data.

01:05:57.970 --> 01:06:03.290
Also because we are trying
to think to a new environment

01:06:03.290 --> 01:06:09.560
where libraries not only
will publish data in RDF

01:06:09.560 --> 01:06:14.630
but will produce authority
data and original data in RDF.

01:06:14.630 --> 01:06:20.800
So, a new environment that will
use all these tools that come

01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:24.310
from our project but
also from other projects.

01:06:24.310 --> 01:06:28.220
I have a whole Library
of Congress projects

01:06:28.220 --> 01:06:32.190
to put together and
to give to libraries.

01:06:32.190 --> 01:06:35.100
So, this new instrument
to produce

01:06:35.100 --> 01:06:39.030
and to manage data in RDF.

01:06:39.030 --> 01:06:43.190
Of course, in this case, we need
to think to another scenario

01:06:43.190 --> 01:06:48.100
where the conversion will be
from RDF to MARC, for example,

01:06:48.100 --> 01:06:53.260
because a lot of libraries
will continue to use MARC 25,

01:06:53.260 --> 01:07:00.140
MARC 21 as a cataloging format,
as format to exchange data.

01:07:00.140 --> 01:07:05.270
So, the attention to change
and now we are thinking

01:07:05.270 --> 01:07:09.010
to imagine these
processes starting from RDF

01:07:09.010 --> 01:07:12.530
and ending with MARC 21.

01:07:12.530 --> 01:07:18.820
But I hope to have
someone, a few interested

01:07:18.820 --> 01:07:24.500
in these use cases
and to contribute

01:07:24.500 --> 01:07:29.490
in developing these use cases
that now we are starting to work

01:07:29.490 --> 01:07:33.810
with all librarians that
are part of this project.

01:07:33.810 --> 01:07:37.510
So, I jump to conclusion
because I think

01:07:37.510 --> 01:07:43.350
that you already can imagine
the conclusion, how important is

01:07:43.350 --> 01:07:47.820
to sharing and to reuse
information resources,

01:07:47.820 --> 01:07:53.650
how it could be important not
only for librarians but also

01:07:53.650 --> 01:07:58.090
for end users to have
an enriched information,

01:07:58.090 --> 01:08:01.630
a linked information,
to have the possibility

01:08:01.630 --> 01:08:06.510
to receive also information
from online dictionaries,

01:08:06.510 --> 01:08:10.780
online encyclopedias,
that usually they use,

01:08:10.780 --> 01:08:14.120
and to have a common
knowledge base,

01:08:14.120 --> 01:08:20.720
a common shared information
with all the world.

01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:22.840
So, thank you for attention,

01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:25.510
and if you have questions,
we are available.

01:08:25.510 --> 01:08:37.640
[ Audience Applause ]

01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:39.000
&gt;&gt; Beacher Wiggins:
Well, you've heard a lot.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.550
What questions do you have?

01:08:42.860 --> 01:08:44.180
Aaron?

01:08:44.180 --> 01:08:47.640
&gt;&gt; Would there be a way that
we could get data from somebody

01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:50.430
who doesn't plan
on sharing with us?

01:08:50.430 --> 01:08:51.730
I'll give an example.

01:08:51.730 --> 01:08:53.030
I do Italian law.

01:08:53.030 --> 01:08:55.720
Many of the authors
are magistrates.

01:08:55.720 --> 01:08:59.770
I discovered that if put the
name, the word, Magistrato,

01:08:59.770 --> 01:09:05.190
and then even Nato or Nata, I
almost always get the Ministry

01:09:05.190 --> 01:09:08.280
of Justice appointment list
where the person was appointed

01:09:08.280 --> 01:09:12.350
or promoted, which gives their
birth date and place of birth,

01:09:12.350 --> 01:09:15.770
which is very useful, since it
seems many authors in the world

01:09:15.770 --> 01:09:17.910
like to have the same
name as other authors.

01:09:17.910 --> 01:09:19.470
But of course, the Ministry

01:09:19.470 --> 01:09:23.410
of Justice is not producing
this list to help catalogers.

01:09:23.410 --> 01:09:26.480
Or another example was
Italy, for example,

01:09:26.480 --> 01:09:29.980
I also discovered
there's a union list

01:09:29.980 --> 01:09:35.410
of Italian Law libraries that
has cataloging, full cataloging

01:09:35.410 --> 01:09:38.160
for records that the
Casalini record that LC

01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:42.760
or OCLC isn't just like a
core acquisitions record,

01:09:42.760 --> 01:09:46.180
but they're beautiful
records by Law Libraries,

01:09:46.180 --> 01:09:48.410
but there's not any way
to get the data other

01:09:48.410 --> 01:09:50.290
than cutting and pasting.

01:09:50.290 --> 01:09:52.670
Is there a way from all
of this we could get data

01:09:52.670 --> 01:09:56.390
without people having
produced it for us?

01:09:58.910 --> 01:10:00.210
&gt;&gt; Michele Casalini: Thank you

01:10:00.210 --> 01:10:04.120
because this is absolutely a
very interesting domain, I mean,

01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:09.580
that needs progressively to
be covered, I mean, and there,

01:10:09.580 --> 01:10:17.260
I mean, I guess, and totally
Tiziana can help me in replying.

01:10:17.260 --> 01:10:22.910
This can be done through
various, in various ways,

01:10:22.910 --> 01:10:29.060
using a source, I mean,
various data sources.

01:10:29.060 --> 01:10:37.380
I make an example that is
not completely, I mean,

01:10:37.380 --> 01:10:41.770
overlapping with what you were
saying, but just to tell you,

01:10:41.770 --> 01:10:44.150
I mean, that there
is the intention

01:10:44.150 --> 01:10:48.430
to address these
kinds of topics.

01:10:48.430 --> 01:10:53.750
In Italia, there is an
agency, a national agency

01:10:53.750 --> 01:10:56.490
for the evaluation of the
research output [inaudible],

01:10:56.490 --> 01:11:01.840
and they have, and we
were involved in it to set

01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:08.540
up a working group to study the
possibility to make, let's say,

01:11:08.540 --> 01:11:14.100
better use of the information
and to have a database

01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:18.700
that can then be
shared with a community

01:11:18.700 --> 01:11:23.080
in a more efficient way.

01:11:23.080 --> 01:11:30.860
The other, and also some attempt
to make use of the database

01:11:30.860 --> 01:11:34.650
of ORCID database in where a lot

01:11:34.650 --> 01:11:42.680
of Italia researchers are
now obliged to be registered.

01:11:42.680 --> 01:11:47.150
So, about to mention,
it is certainly, I mean,

01:11:47.150 --> 01:11:52.540
we have to double check and put
it on our list that the Minister

01:11:52.540 --> 01:11:56.000
of Justice, I mean, and
of course in the extent

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:59.330
that they can publish
and they're willing

01:11:59.330 --> 01:12:06.200
to make available their data
that list data is then included

01:12:06.200 --> 01:12:09.430
for having a more
precise identification.

01:12:09.430 --> 01:12:10.730
&gt;&gt; Tiziana Possemato:

01:12:10.730 --> 01:12:14.490
And probably interesting is
also the role of publishers

01:12:14.490 --> 01:12:18.550
because publishers usually
are the first people

01:12:18.550 --> 01:12:22.420
who met the author, and
usually they can have a lot

01:12:22.420 --> 01:12:26.630
of information that the
librarian cannot have.

01:12:26.630 --> 01:12:32.240
So, also in this case, and in
Italy, there is an initiative

01:12:32.240 --> 01:12:39.060
to involve the organization
of all publishers and be more,

01:12:39.060 --> 01:12:43.910
more strongly including
this type of project

01:12:43.910 --> 01:12:51.010
because they are really the
corporate body and the entity

01:12:51.010 --> 01:12:55.100
that can have some
information to identify it

01:12:55.100 --> 01:12:57.970
to disambiguate the
person or type of people.

01:13:05.070 --> 01:13:06.370
&gt;&gt; A question.

01:13:06.370 --> 01:13:07.670
&gt;&gt; Yes.

01:13:07.670 --> 01:13:10.020
&gt;&gt; When will you release
the dataset and publish it

01:13:10.020 --> 01:13:11.720
to the various libraries?

01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:13.940
&gt;&gt; The participating libraries.

01:13:13.940 --> 01:13:15.240
&gt;&gt; For Phase 2?

01:13:15.240 --> 01:13:16.540
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

01:13:16.540 --> 01:13:17.840
&gt;&gt; Tiziana Possemato: Okay, we
started to release in October,

01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:23.150
and we are progressively
releasing to all libraries.

01:13:23.150 --> 01:13:30.740
We left the Library of
Congress as last because it is,

01:13:30.740 --> 01:13:33.210
of course, a bit
more complicated

01:13:33.210 --> 01:13:38.770
and because we preferred to be
sure before, but we are working

01:13:38.770 --> 01:13:43.400
in defining the last
requirements coming

01:13:43.400 --> 01:13:51.570
from extensions, and we started
sending very, very small files

01:13:51.570 --> 01:13:57.370
to the group, the BIBFRAME
group, so to check the quality.

01:13:57.370 --> 01:14:03.770
And so, we think that within one
month we will end this process.

01:14:03.770 --> 01:14:06.110
But of course, this
is important.

01:14:06.110 --> 01:14:12.290
The Phase 2, the release of
this deliverable, is something

01:14:12.290 --> 01:14:15.310
that progressively will continue

01:14:15.310 --> 01:14:20.860
because we discover each
day new requirements coming

01:14:20.860 --> 01:14:25.500
from BIBFRAME but also
from PCC, URI group.

01:14:25.500 --> 01:14:31.930
For example, we are waiting
to have the final requirement

01:14:31.930 --> 01:14:40.310
to manage work in subfield 7 and
8 because we know that some is

01:14:40.310 --> 01:14:45.560
under discussion, and we are
taking part in this discussion.

01:14:45.560 --> 01:14:48.670
But when finally a
decision will be taken,

01:14:48.670 --> 01:14:54.430
we need build again the MARC
21 with the new requirements

01:14:54.430 --> 01:14:57.200
and give to libraries.

01:14:57.200 --> 01:15:01.360
So, I think that the
library understands

01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:06.120
that it is a delicate
phase of transition

01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:08.220
and that each day
happens something

01:15:08.220 --> 01:15:12.830
so that we can improve
the process.

01:15:17.300 --> 01:15:20.300
&gt;&gt; Beacher Wiggins: Needless
to say, I am encouraged

01:15:20.300 --> 01:15:25.530
that BIBFRAME is a workable
and viable model based

01:15:25.530 --> 01:15:27.650
on what you have shared.

01:15:27.650 --> 01:15:31.450
I guess one of the questions
that comes out is you're working

01:15:31.450 --> 01:15:34.240
with a discrete group
of libraries,

01:15:34.240 --> 01:15:40.990
so how do you perceive this
being shared more broadly to --

01:15:40.990 --> 01:15:43.270
is it all going to rely on each

01:15:43.270 --> 01:15:49.890
of the individual member
libraries receiving its data

01:15:49.890 --> 01:15:54.950
and then sharing that data
through a publishing mechanism

01:15:54.950 --> 01:15:59.830
and making it available
for searching as opposed

01:15:59.830 --> 01:16:06.100
to a single source that is
someplace that's getting

01:16:06.100 --> 01:16:13.840
interested, the library or
cultural institution can link

01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:20.140
into as part of a
linked data environment?

01:16:20.140 --> 01:16:29.680
Obviously, I want to
share but also realize

01:16:29.680 --> 01:16:34.000
that you are an entity
that has to worry

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:38.360
about all that input into it.

01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:45.160
What do you say about that,
and I know you will be meeting

01:16:45.160 --> 01:16:46.490
with colleagues in
Denver on Friday,

01:16:46.490 --> 01:16:49.070
which I won't be attending;

01:16:49.070 --> 01:16:51.620
probably the first
time in 25 years.

01:16:51.620 --> 01:16:54.430
But what are your
thoughts on that?

01:16:54.430 --> 01:16:56.720
&gt;&gt; Michele Casalini: Thank
you for asking the question

01:16:56.720 --> 01:16:59.400
because it's, of course,
a very crucial one.

01:16:59.400 --> 01:17:01.260
First of all, the
data is all your data.

01:17:01.260 --> 01:17:05.100
So, you can use it to enter
locally; you can use it

01:17:05.100 --> 01:17:06.980
in a shared repository.

01:17:06.980 --> 01:17:08.280
I mean, it's totally up to you.

01:17:08.280 --> 01:17:09.910
As the future of this
initiative that is ready now

01:17:09.910 --> 01:17:14.170
in the very short future to
come out under the research

01:17:14.170 --> 01:17:16.600
and development phase and
to go into production,

01:17:16.600 --> 01:17:22.080
but what this production
environment will be it really is

01:17:22.080 --> 01:17:25.980
up to you in the sense that
we intentionally don't have a

01:17:25.980 --> 01:17:27.720
product to propose.

01:17:27.720 --> 01:17:30.410
I mean, it must, otherwise,
it would not make sense.

01:17:30.410 --> 01:17:34.780
So, from our perspective,
it must be really designed

01:17:34.780 --> 01:17:39.220
and based on your
expectation to your priorities.

01:17:39.220 --> 01:17:42.510
Another aspect to
say is to mention is

01:17:42.510 --> 01:17:47.530
that everything is
totally independent

01:17:47.530 --> 01:17:52.130
from the library local system.

01:17:52.130 --> 01:17:59.830
So, what our feeling so far
is that, and this was one

01:17:59.830 --> 01:18:04.730
of the goals, of course, of
Phase 1 and 2 of SHARE-VDE is

01:18:04.730 --> 01:18:13.190
to improve that certain number
of tools are what started

01:18:13.190 --> 01:18:16.770
to be mature to be
put into production,

01:18:16.770 --> 01:18:20.600
and this then can
be used in ways

01:18:20.600 --> 01:18:25.290
that really your community
will shape environment together

01:18:25.290 --> 01:18:27.040
and to do certain things.

01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:30.890
A consensus of a certain number
of institutions is needed

01:18:30.890 --> 01:18:37.380
because otherwise it
can make little sense,

01:18:37.380 --> 01:18:42.880
and there are therefore aspects
related to the availability

01:18:42.880 --> 01:18:46.490
of the [inaudible] in RDF
of the knowledge base.

01:18:46.490 --> 01:18:52.890
In order to have a unique
identifier among the community,

01:18:52.890 --> 01:18:59.230
there are aspects related to the
production or conversion of data

01:18:59.230 --> 01:19:03.250
after all the reconciliation
processes and enrichment

01:19:03.250 --> 01:19:07.320
into linked open data.

01:19:07.320 --> 01:19:11.510
And yeah, so let's
say it's really,

01:19:11.510 --> 01:19:17.970
we hope now that there are
enough ingredients on the table

01:19:17.970 --> 01:19:23.010
to play and to allow you to,
I mean, to express your vision

01:19:23.010 --> 01:19:29.600
of what meets best your needs,
and this is the intention

01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:32.240
of the coming meeting on
Friday and, of course,

01:19:32.240 --> 01:19:35.290
the discussion will continue.

01:19:35.290 --> 01:19:38.090
From the side of Casalini Libri

01:19:38.090 --> 01:19:41.190
and our original
Cataloging Department,

01:19:41.190 --> 01:19:50.460
we are now almost ready to start
applying MARC record enriched

01:19:50.460 --> 01:19:53.680
with URIs or to supply

01:19:53.680 --> 01:19:57.100
to libraries the
equivalent BIBFRAME datasets.

01:19:57.100 --> 01:20:02.660
And this is, of course, as
original cataloging agency,

01:20:02.660 --> 01:20:08.330
one of our responsibilities,
as we cover, I mean,

01:20:08.330 --> 01:20:16.030
your cataloging for the
Romance language countries.

01:20:16.030 --> 01:20:17.330
So, I'm sorry, Beacher,

01:20:17.330 --> 01:20:20.060
if my answer was not
a complete answer.

01:20:20.060 --> 01:20:22.380
&gt;&gt; Beacher Wiggins: Your
answer is about as good

01:20:22.380 --> 01:20:26.860
as I would expect you to give
us on the spot, but I wanted

01:20:26.860 --> 01:20:31.840
to hear you thinking
like that and to see

01:20:31.840 --> 01:20:36.400
if there was any
reaction to that.

01:20:36.400 --> 01:20:40.630
Other comments or
questions, Melanie?

01:20:40.630 --> 01:20:51.180
&gt;&gt; Actually, I had a question
that he bounced off of me last

01:20:51.180 --> 01:21:00.600
because one of the benefits
of the system we have now is

01:21:00.600 --> 01:21:07.390
that we can't benefit
from others cataloging.

01:21:07.390 --> 01:21:10.920
This is an example we put
in an authority record.

01:21:10.920 --> 01:21:15.650
I made the authority record
as a baseline of information,

01:21:15.650 --> 01:21:19.010
but the next cataloger works
with that person's name

01:21:19.010 --> 01:21:20.330
for which more information
that can be added to it

01:21:20.330 --> 01:21:21.630
and everybody benefits
from that.

01:21:21.630 --> 01:21:22.930
I was wondering where does your
work take place in the system

01:21:22.930 --> 01:21:24.230
since it is quite complex?

01:21:24.230 --> 01:21:25.530
Is there any way that
it's, are other catalogers

01:21:25.530 --> 01:21:26.830
or institutions might work with
the data that you've supplied,

01:21:26.830 --> 01:21:28.130
that any changes they might make
to feed back into your system?

01:21:28.130 --> 01:21:29.430
Would it be reasonable
to do it in the same way?

01:21:29.430 --> 01:21:30.730
And not just as a catalog
results or perhaps, other users,

01:21:30.730 --> 01:21:32.030
patrons who might be
able to say I'm looking

01:21:32.030 --> 01:21:33.330
at this book as I'm reading it.

01:21:33.330 --> 01:21:34.630
Oh, I could actually move that
catalog record to [inaudible].

01:21:34.630 --> 01:21:36.430
So, [inaudible] that this
person was the writer of this?

01:21:36.430 --> 01:21:42.170
[ Audience Laughter ]

01:21:42.170 --> 01:21:46.550
&gt;&gt; Michele Casalini: That
and the feedback, I mean,

01:21:46.550 --> 01:21:50.010
I answer certainly very
superficially, I mean,

01:21:50.010 --> 01:21:52.170
so please, I beg your pardon.

01:21:52.170 --> 01:21:57.440
The feedback of more
precise information

01:21:57.440 --> 01:22:01.930
that is already available
or, of course, the addition

01:22:01.930 --> 01:22:06.680
of certain data elements
that are added

01:22:06.680 --> 01:22:10.010
with all the Provenance
Declaration, of course,

01:22:10.010 --> 01:22:17.970
and are absolutely part of this
two-draft of data flow, I mean,

01:22:17.970 --> 01:22:26.480
that foresee a cooperation
among the institutions.

01:22:26.480 --> 01:22:30.640
So, there are institutions
that foresee certainly

01:22:30.640 --> 01:22:36.880
to keep data locally but that
can take advantage of this,

01:22:36.880 --> 01:22:43.820
I mean, Cloud datasets
and knowledge base.

01:22:43.820 --> 01:22:49.470
There are other libraries
that foresee to rely more on,

01:22:49.470 --> 01:22:53.940
let's say, on Cloud approach.

01:22:53.940 --> 01:22:57.520
But in any case, this
aspect of interaction

01:22:57.520 --> 01:23:02.660
of data is absolutely critical,
I mean, and very important.

01:23:02.660 --> 01:23:03.960
&gt;&gt; Tiziana Possemato:
This is so important

01:23:03.960 --> 01:23:09.690
that this was the first
request that we received

01:23:09.690 --> 01:23:17.310
from our first project in Italy,
SHARE catalog that we built

01:23:17.310 --> 01:23:21.270
with eight university libraries
and in the South of Italy.

01:23:21.270 --> 01:23:28.740
And so, also, in this case, one
of use cases is the opportunity

01:23:28.740 --> 01:23:40.530
to have a tool to share in the
first step of the production is

01:23:40.530 --> 01:23:44.760
to share suggestions
for correction,

01:23:44.760 --> 01:23:49.790
not to add it directly.

01:23:49.790 --> 01:23:54.380
The heading without a
corrector authorization level

01:23:54.380 --> 01:23:57.690
but to have a system
to share suggestions

01:23:57.690 --> 01:24:03.970
so that also end users, and when
we think about the end users,

01:24:03.970 --> 01:24:08.490
we don't think also to
students but also to professors,

01:24:08.490 --> 01:24:11.640
to experts of the
mark up and so on,

01:24:11.640 --> 01:24:15.590
can give that contribution
to the project.

01:24:15.590 --> 01:24:20.030
So, can sciences can
send an information

01:24:20.030 --> 01:24:24.970
about manifestation
and your work.

01:24:24.970 --> 01:24:27.380
We handle two different
entities,

01:24:27.380 --> 01:24:29.150
but this is the same person.

01:24:29.150 --> 01:24:30.640
This is the same work.

01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:34.880
This is the same subject in
different languages and so on.

01:24:34.880 --> 01:24:40.670
So, it collaborative and
cooperative tools that will be

01:24:40.670 --> 01:24:50.890
in different steps or grades
of authorization to arrive

01:24:50.890 --> 01:24:56.220
to the last level that will
be the ability, if authorized,

01:24:56.220 --> 01:25:00.130
to change the heading and
to correct, for example,

01:25:00.130 --> 01:25:03.040
the cluster and so on.

01:25:03.040 --> 01:25:05.970
This is already present
in our use cases.

01:25:11.980 --> 01:25:28.230
&gt;&gt; As a clarification along
the same lines, so there,

01:25:28.230 --> 01:25:45.670
from what others have just
expressed, there is an ability

01:25:48.620 --> 01:25:53.660
for institution specific levels
of access for, let's say,

01:25:53.660 --> 01:25:57.560
a specific vocabulary
like the Getty Thesaurus

01:25:57.560 --> 01:26:02.170
or that won't be shared back

01:26:02.170 --> 01:26:07.950
out into the larger community
will be imported and just used

01:26:07.950 --> 01:26:09.560
in the same frameworks.

01:26:09.560 --> 01:26:14.520
Is that correct,
just to confirm?

01:26:14.520 --> 01:26:15.820
&gt;&gt; Yes. This is correct.

01:26:15.820 --> 01:26:17.120
Yes.

01:26:17.120 --> 01:26:18.420
&gt;&gt; Okay, I just wanted to
make sure I understood.

01:26:18.420 --> 01:26:19.720
Thank you.

01:26:19.720 --> 01:26:21.020
&gt;&gt; Beacher Wiggins:
Well, thank you.

01:26:21.020 --> 01:26:22.320
It is 11:30, and again
thank you for sharing this.

01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:23.620
I'm hoping by the time we wrap
up BIBFRAME pilot test 2 in June

01:26:23.620 --> 01:26:24.920
and get our assessment
and you can get feedback

01:26:24.920 --> 01:26:26.220
from external entities that are
using BIBFRAME we'll be ready

01:26:26.220 --> 01:26:27.520
to say that the library
is moving forward

01:26:27.520 --> 01:26:28.820
in this brave new world.

01:26:28.820 --> 01:26:30.120
I was interested in pioneers.

01:26:30.120 --> 01:26:31.420
So, again, on behalf of
the Library of Congress,

01:26:31.420 --> 01:26:32.720
thank you so much for your time
and your effort this morning.
