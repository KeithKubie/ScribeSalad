00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.240
 
well so what the Large Hadron Collider

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250
well so what the Large Hadron Collider
 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.350
well so what the Large Hadron Collider
is it's called the LHC more really early

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:11.360
is it's called the LHC more really early
 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.499
is it's called the LHC more really early
its

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509
its
 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.330
its
collided together two protons so there's

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340
collided together two protons so there's
 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.430
collided together two protons so there's
underground rings 20 and underground

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440
underground rings 20 and underground
 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.260
underground rings 20 and underground
ring 27 kilometers in circumference and

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270
ring 27 kilometers in circumference and
 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.900
ring 27 kilometers in circumference and
what happens is proton beams are go

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910
what happens is proton beams are go
 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.490
what happens is proton beams are go
around and they are accelerated by

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500
around and they are accelerated by
 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.130
around and they are accelerated by
magnetic fields as they go around and

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:24.140
magnetic fields as they go around and
 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.330
magnetic fields as they go around and
they go in opposite directions there are

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340
they go in opposite directions there are
 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.920
they go in opposite directions there are
two beams accelerated to extremely high

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930
two beams accelerated to extremely high
 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.550
two beams accelerated to extremely high
energy and then they collide together

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:30.560
energy and then they collide together
 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.620
energy and then they collide together
and when they collide together

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:32.630
and when they collide together
 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.229
and when they collide together
constituents inside the protons become

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239
constituents inside the protons become
 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.450
constituents inside the protons become
energy and that energy can turn into

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460
energy and that energy can turn into
 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.369
energy and that energy can turn into
particles with mass because after all

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379
particles with mass because after all
 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:41.510
particles with mass because after all
equals mc-squared

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520
equals mc-squared
 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.310
equals mc-squared
which is to say if you have a lot of

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320
which is to say if you have a lot of
 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.690
which is to say if you have a lot of
energy you can make particles that have

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700
energy you can make particles that have
 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.350
energy you can make particles that have
big mass m and so the idea is to make

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360
big mass m and so the idea is to make
 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.880
big mass m and so the idea is to make
particles that you wouldn't have been

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890
particles that you wouldn't have been
 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.279
particles that you wouldn't have been
able to have seen before on earth

00:00:51.279 --> 00:00:51.289
able to have seen before on earth
 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:53.840
able to have seen before on earth
because they're just heavier than things

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850
because they're just heavier than things
 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.130
because they're just heavier than things
that would have been accessible to us

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140
that would have been accessible to us
 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.529
that would have been accessible to us
and by looking at what those particles

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539
and by looking at what those particles
 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.510
and by looking at what those particles
are what are their properties where the

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520
are what are their properties where the
 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.490
are what are their properties where the
forces that apply at those scales we're

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500
forces that apply at those scales we're
 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.020
forces that apply at those scales we're
trying to understand what's happening at

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030
trying to understand what's happening at
 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.520
trying to understand what's happening at
shorter distances what's happening at

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530
shorter distances what's happening at
 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.859
shorter distances what's happening at
higher energies what are the more basic

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869
higher energies what are the more basic
 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.719
higher energies what are the more basic
ingredients that matter what are the

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729
ingredients that matter what are the
 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.170
ingredients that matter what are the
more fundamental forces and so it one

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180
more fundamental forces and so it one
 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.429
more fundamental forces and so it one

extra dimensions and it would be a

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590
extra dimensions and it would be a
 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.139
extra dimensions and it would be a

who introduced the idea of an extra

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780
who introduced the idea of an extra
 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.010
who introduced the idea of an extra
dimension of physics in 1919 and he was

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020
dimension of physics in 1919 and he was
 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.810
dimension of physics in 1919 and he was
trying to unify the forces that were

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820
trying to unify the forces that were
 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.399
trying to unify the forces that were
known then which were only gravity and

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409
known then which were only gravity and
 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.370
known then which were only gravity and
electromagnetism and he proposed an

electromagnetism and he proposed an
 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.490
electromagnetism and he proposed an
extra dimension of space to try and he

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500
extra dimension of space to try and he
 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.530
extra dimension of space to try and he
realized I was the theory allowed an

the person who suggested that this extra
 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.470
the person who suggested that this extra
dimension was tiny it was rolled up

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480
dimension was tiny it was rolled up
 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.270
