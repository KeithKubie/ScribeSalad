So what we're gonna do for this experiment 
is we are going to take a balloon, 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.120
a real big clear balloon, and we've got a match, 
and we roll the string up on the match.

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:12.160
We're gonna start blowing the balloon up.. just a little bit..

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:16.250
and we're gonna, make it where we can get a straight shot, straight down into

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.420
the balloon. We'll drop the match, down in there,

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:21.920
and proceed to blow it up.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.790
Alright, so you can see we have a match, dangling inside of a balloon,

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.970
but watch this. It's pretty cool. When I let the air out of the balloon it kind of

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:35.160
pushes the match out. [laugh]

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.350
It's like.. eating the string and pushing it.

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.480
It's great. Alright. Alright. We'll do it again.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.640
Except this time we'll leave it.
OK, so. What we're gonna do here, is we're going to try

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.700
to light that match, inside the balloon, without popping the balloon.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.730
Well at least, until the fire pops the balloon. OK so,

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.500
It's your show Johan, go for it.
(Johan) OK 3..2..1..

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.140
OK flame.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.320
ohh there you go.
(Destin) Nice.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.900
[unintelligible]
(Destin) Awesome! We didn't even pop the balloon!

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:26.680
That's it.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.860
(Johan) Nice. Without popping the balloon.
(Destin) Check.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.040
(Johan) I was expecting the match to pop down, like, to fall down.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.220
(Destin) Yeah but why didn't the laser pop the balloon?
(Johan) The balloon is transparent so the light

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.400
just passes through and as it doesn't absorb it, the balloon doesn't heat and it doesn't pop.

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.530
(Destin) That's it. You're getting Smarter Every Day. 
Have a good one.

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.640
