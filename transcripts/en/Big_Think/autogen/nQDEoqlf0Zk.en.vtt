they're very very young we have to
 

00:00:18.329 --> 00:00:22.339
they're very very young we have to
consider first of all the stimulation

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:22.349

of takes over and you're drawn into it
 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.260
of takes over and you're drawn into it
because it's

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270
because it's
 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.960
because it's
so much going on there for young

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970
so much going on there for young
 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.650
so much going on there for young
children it can be very over stimulating

children it can be very over stimulating
 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.470
children it can be very over stimulating
and it can discourage them from being

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480
and it can discourage them from being
 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.630
and it can discourage them from being
active learners the active learners that

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640
active learners the active learners that
 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.080
active learners the active learners that
we want them to be that will help them

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090
we want them to be that will help them
 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.260
we want them to be that will help them
and throughout life and you know help

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270
and throughout life and you know help
 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:34.940
and throughout life and you know help
them prosper and help them reach their

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950
them prosper and help them reach their

full full potential make school easier

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310
full full potential make school easier
 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.860
full full potential make school easier
you know a lot of practical things like

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870
you know a lot of practical things like
 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.720
you know a lot of practical things like
that make them able to retain what they

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730
that make them able to retain what they
 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.780
that make them able to retain what they
learn and interested in knowing more so

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790
learn and interested in knowing more so
 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.430
learn and interested in knowing more so
it's interesting that's the you know

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440
it's interesting that's the you know
 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.430
it's interesting that's the you know
screens they're kind of the extreme on

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440
screens they're kind of the extreme on
 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.320
screens they're kind of the extreme on
one end of things babies can understand

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330
one end of things babies can understand
 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:04.130
one end of things babies can understand
so just to give you an example take okay

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140
so just to give you an example take okay
 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.750
so just to give you an example take okay
so then there's their screens where

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760
so then there's their screens where
 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.310
so then there's their screens where
babies are totally passive and they you

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320
babies are totally passive and they you
 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.080
babies are totally passive and they you
know it's just coming at them and they

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090
know it's just coming at them and they
 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.090
know it's just coming at them and they
they can't really get it then there's

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100
they can't really get it then there's
 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.760
they can't really get it then there's
something like a something where you you

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770
something like a something where you you
 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:15.440
something like a something where you you
know a toy where you push a button and

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450
know a toy where you push a button and
 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.440
know a toy where you push a button and
it makes a sound right so that's pretty

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450
it makes a sound right so that's pretty
 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.330
it makes a sound right so that's pretty
hard for them to understand too I mean

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340
hard for them to understand too I mean
 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.310
hard for them to understand too I mean
they have some little bit of agency

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320
they have some little bit of agency
 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:23.810
they have some little bit of agency
there that they can figure out well if I

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820
there that they can figure out well if I
 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.280
there that they can figure out well if I
do this it makes this sound but they're

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290
do this it makes this sound but they're
 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:26.449
do this it makes this sound but they're
never gonna really understand where the

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459
never gonna really understand where the
 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.020
never gonna really understand where the
sound comes from in those early years or

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030
sound comes from in those early years or
 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.970
sound comes from in those early years or
you know in the first year or two and

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980
you know in the first year or two and
 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.530
you know in the first year or two and
then there's a rattle so I mean it's a

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540
then there's a rattle so I mean it's a
 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.650
then there's a rattle so I mean it's a
rattle a terrible thing no but with this

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660
rattle a terrible thing no but with this
 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.740
rattle a terrible thing no but with this
approach we just try to be aware that a

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750
approach we just try to be aware that a
 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.160
approach we just try to be aware that a
rattle has isn't mystery there's a

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170
rattle has isn't mystery there's a
 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.320
rattle has isn't mystery there's a
mysterious element then there's those

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330
mysterious element then there's those
 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.199
mysterious element then there's those
rattles where you can see and through

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209
rattles where you can see and through
 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:53.150
rattles where you can see and through
them to the little thing that's making

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160
them to the little thing that's making
 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.970
them to the little thing that's making
the sound a little Bell or whatever and

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980
the sound a little Bell or whatever and
 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.650
the sound a little Bell or whatever and
so that's a little more the child can

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660
so that's a little more the child can
 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.090
so that's a little more the child can
feel a little more capable of mastering

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100
feel a little more capable of mastering
 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.010
feel a little more capable of mastering
that and understanding that so that's a

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:01.020
that and understanding that so that's a
 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.949
that and understanding that so that's a
little more encouraging but then what

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959
little more encouraging but then what
 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:08.090
little more encouraging but then what
about taking a yes one of the things we

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100
about taking a yes one of the things we
 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.940
about taking a yes one of the things we
use this play objects in our classrooms

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950
use this play objects in our classrooms
 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.520
use this play objects in our classrooms
where we teach parents and we recommend

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530
where we teach parents and we recommend
 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.560
where we teach parents and we recommend
this at home too is little stainless

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:15.570
this at home too is little stainless
 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:18.170
this at home too is little stainless
steel cups or bowls so let's just say a

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180
steel cups or bowls so let's just say a
 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.170
steel cups or bowls so let's just say a
child takes as a block and a little

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180
child takes as a block and a little
 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.580
child takes as a block and a little
stainless steel cup and decides to you

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590
stainless steel cup and decides to you
 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.980
stainless steel cup and decides to you
know take the block over here make these

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990
know take the block over here make these
 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:29.100
know take the block over here make these
sounds now take it off
