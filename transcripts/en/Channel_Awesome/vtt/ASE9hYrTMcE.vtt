00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.540
Uh, let's get this over with. "Belle's Magical World"!

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:22.600
I can safely say that this is the first Disney sequel I've seen during this Disneycember that is clearly just doing the bare minimum.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.220
Hell, I don't even know if it's doing that.

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.740
I guess with the popularity of "Beauty and the Beast: Enchanted Christmas," they felt, well, why not do another one?

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.400
Just--something, anything. I don't know, throw it out there!

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:39.960
And that's what this movie feels like. They just took something, anything, and vomited it up for us.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.280
What's the story? There isn't one.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.780
Well--no, th-th-there's, like, four or five.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.600
I-it's not even really a movie.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.120
It doesn't really begin, it doesn't really end.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.100
It starts off in a lame-ass CG library.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:01:00.220
It gives us the set-up again, how Belle traveled to a castle and comes across all these lil characters and the Beast, and--then it's just a few stories about when she was there.

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.980
There's a part where she's angry at the Beast, and they fight over who's gonna apologize first.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.240
That ends.

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.860
Then there's a part about Lumiere being in love with the feather duster.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.960
That ends.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.240
There's one where Mrs. Potts feels left out. That ends.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.740
And then there's one with a bird with a broken wing, that ends, and then it all ends!

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:15.700
That was it!

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.480
I-it doesn't even wrap up. The opening at least had a narrator saying, "Hey, this is going on."

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.360
The ending just--i-it just stops!

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.080
It's pointless. It's stupid. There is no reason for it to exist.

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.340
I-is that a movie? Is that what counts as a movie?

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.860
Talk about false advertising. Look at the cover.

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.920
It shows Belle in the yellow dress, the famous yellow dress. It doesn't even appear in this.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.080
What does appear, really sucks.

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:44.200
While the animation in "Enchanted Christmas"wasn't phenomenal, it's still pretty good. Again, you could tell they were trying.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.200
They just didn't have the budget to do as well as the first one, but they were really trying to make it look like the first one.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.840
It looks like they took the budget of "Enchanted Christmas" and cut that in half again!

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.000
Look at everybody. They look awful!

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.040
This doesn't look like a "Beauty and the Beast" movie, it looks like "Beauty and the Beast" the TV show, like what they did with "Aladdin" the TV show.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:07.700
Was that the idea? Was this--going to be a "Beauty and the Beast" TV show, but then they just scrapped  it at the last minute?

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:13.680
But they figure, "Eh, we've got four or five of these already done, just slap a movie title on it and say, 'Belle's Magical World.'"

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.480
What's even magical about it? We've seen all this before.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.320
There's nothing new, it's-gr-we're used to this! There's nothing even that magical about it!

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.900
What, is that weird face that has now become a meme magical?

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.560
Oh, okay actually, that is a little magical.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.140
But everything else is totally pointless.

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.920
If you're just gonna lazily throw these things together and expect it to be a movie, expect it to be judged as a movie.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.580
This is clearly just something for 3- or 4-year olds.

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.420
I know what you're thinking: "Oh, isn't that like what the original 'Beauty and the Beast' was?"

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.380
No! It was nominated for Best Film! Not Best Animated Film, that didn't even exist yet.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.000
Maybe it's because of this movie that that category exists.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.140
I ju-ju-ju--come on, it's Disney!

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.140
Is there anything good in it?

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.640
Well, I like this line.

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.420
"What shall we do?"

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.060
"There is only one thing to do. We must scream like bloodless cowards."

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.400
[Both scream]

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.640
And this one's kinda cute.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.120
"Hold on, Lumiere!"

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.260
"Considering the option, I have no intention of doing otherwise."

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:11.840
I guess the cartoon-y animation isn't that bad, but the animation when it's supposed to look serious, like in "Belle or the Beast" is just pathetic.

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:19.640
So yeah, two lines from Lumiere; some cartoon-y stuff that, because of the low bar, I had to congratulate them on looking cartoon-y; but aside from that?

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.520
No, there's really nothin'.

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.120
If you have a toddler that likes anything, show this.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.800
Because...they'll like anything.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.020
"Belle's Magical World," it sucks, I'm on to the next one, bye.
