00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:08.450

It's time for another challenging quiz to
test your cinematic knowledge with.

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.840
Do you think you know everything there is
to know about the weird and wonderful world

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:12.840
of movies?

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.290
Then get your teeth sunk in to this!

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:17.610
Coming up are ten questions about some of
the biggest movies around - both old and new

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:20.510
- and if you can get all of them right, then
you can truly consider yourself to be a serious

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:21.510
movie buff!

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.650
Keep your score as you go along and then leave
it in the comment section below!

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:25.640
Make sure you tell the truth though, because
you will be punished if we find out you're

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:32.570
lying!This is the latest edition of Screen
Rant's Ultimate Movie Quiz.

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.220
The Goonies
The Goonies looked like it was so much fun

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:35.220
to film.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.500
The cast had an on-screen chemistry that was
second-to-none, so it's hard to believe that

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.249
any of the cast members didn't get along in
real life - but two of them really didn't.

00:00:42.249 --> 00:00:43.249
Which two was it?

00:00:43.249 --> 00:00:47.289
A - Anne Ramsey and John Matuszak
B - Josh Brolin and Kerri Green

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:52.530
C - Corey Feldman and Martha Plimpton
(Screen lights up C)According to Corey Feldman's

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.749
autobiography "Corerography", he and Martha
Plimpton - Mouth and Stef, respectively - didn't

00:00:55.749 --> 00:00:56.749
get along at all.

00:00:56.749 --> 00:01:00.079
This notion has been confirmed by Plimpton
herself, who has gone as far as describing

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:04.320
Feldman as a "fucking asshole".

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.140
Gremlins
At the start of Steven Spielberg's Gremlins,

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.320
the cinema in the town in which the movie
is set is showing movies called "A Boy's Life"

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.400
and "Watch The Skies", but which movies that
Spielberg had previously worked on were these

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.890
actually the working titles of?

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.490
A - E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial and Close Encounters
of the Third Kind

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:27.320
B - Amblin' and Firelight
C - Raiders of the Lost Ark and Poltergeist

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.040
The names of the two movies being shown in
the fictional town of Kingston Falls were

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:37.000
actually the working titles of E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial
and Close Encounters of the Third Kind, respectively.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.270
Home Alone
Contrary to the nature of many of his roles

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.909
as an actor, Joe Pesci is actually a really
nice guy.

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.880
So what did he do while filming Home Alone
to help Macauley Culkin think he was mean,

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:49.880
so that Culkin would deliver a convincing
performance opposite his character Harry Lyme,

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:50.880
the burglar?

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.399
A - He had him visit the set of Goodfellas
to watch him film a scene as a gangster

00:01:53.399 --> 00:02:02.390
B - He completely avoided Culkin on set
C - He stole his lunch

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.881
In order to make Macauley Culkin think he
was mean, just like his character Harry, Joe

00:02:05.881 --> 00:02:12.930
Pesci deliberately avoided the then-child
actor between takes on the set of Home Alone.

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.190
Cloverfield
2008's Cloverfield was a monster movie with

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.920
a difference, in the sense that it was filmed
in the "found footage" style, but images from

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.410
which three classic monster movies appear
within the film?

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.790
A - King Kong (1933), The Beast from 20,000
Fathoms (1953) and Them!

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.050
(1954)
B - Godzilla (1954), The Fly (1958) and Alien

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.600
(1979)
C - King Kong vs. Godzilla (1962), Tentacles

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.610
(1977) and Tremors (1990)
Images from King Kong, The Beast from 20,000

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.910
Fathoms and Them! are hidden within Cloverfield.

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.800
Each image is seen for just a single frame.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.160
The "Them!" picture is shown at 00.24.06,
the "Beast from 20,000 Fathoms" picture is

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.560
shown at 00.45.27, and the "King Kong" picture
is shown at 1.06.55.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.540
Batman: The Killing Joke
This year, DC's animated feature Batman: The

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.190
Killing Joke got a limited theatrical release
and a home video release, but it initially

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.360
went into production in 2009.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.280
What prompted its initial cancellation?

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.130
A - Mark Hamill's refusal to reprise his role
as The Joker

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.340
B - The 2008 death of Heath Ledger
C - The underperformance of Watchmen at the

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.800
box office
When Watchmen - another R-rated DC Comics

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.850
movie - underperformed at the box office in
2009, the planned production of Batman: The

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.000
Killing Joke in the same year was cancelled
due to fears of a similar commercial reaction.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.800
Captain America: Civil War
In the epic comic book movie Captain America:

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.260
Civil War, there's a scene in which Ant-Man
is fired on an arrow by Hawkeye.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.090
This is taken directly from the comic books,
but which comic book was it from specifically?

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.570
A - Tales of Suspense #57
B - The Avengers #223

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:39.820
C - Civil War: Front Line #1
It was actually an Avengers comic book - The

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:43.800
Avengers #223 - from which that Ant-Man-on-an-arrow
scene was taken.

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.040
The comic in question is from 1963 and has
that scene as its front cover.

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.960
Blair Witch
2016 will finally see the release of a sequel

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:55.760
to 1999's The Blair Witch Project that is
worthy of the name (we try to forget about

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.000
2000's Book of Shadows).

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.570
It will be called "Blair Witch", but what
was the movie's working title?

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:06.250
A - The Chase
B - The Witch

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.850
C - The Woods
Blair Witch was originally promoted under

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:12.690
the faux-title The Woods and was finally revealed
as being the third movie in the Blair Witch

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.300
franchise at the 2016 San Diego Comic Con.

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:17.650
Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
When it comes to the aesthetics of his movies,

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.840
Tim Burton likes consistency.

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.460
Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
will see him collaborating with costume designer

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.530
Colleen Atwood on a movie yet again, therefore.

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:28.230
How many times have they worked together in
this way in the past?

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:30.390
A - 8
B â€“ 10

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:36.350
C - 12
Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:40.230
marks the eleventh collaboration between costume
designer Colleen Atwood and Tim Burton, meaning

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:41.230
the pair have worked together on ten occasions
previously.

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:43.450
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs
1937's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:47.600
still the highest-grossing animated movie
of all time when adjusted for inflation.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.440
It was also the highest-grossing film ever
for exactly one year, after which it was knocked

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.310
out of the top spot by which movie?

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:56.100
A - Gone With the Wind
B - Goodbye, Mr. Chips

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:01.420
C - The Wizard of Oz
Having held the title of highest-grossing

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:05.370
film ever for exactly one year, Snow White
and the Seven Dwarfs was knocked off the top

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:09.150
spot by Gone with the Wind - which remains
the highest-grossing film ever when adjusted

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:10.150
for inflation today.

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.880
World War Z
The movie adaptation of Max Brooks' brilliant

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:18.460
World War Z featured Doctor Who star Peter
Capaldi as an actual doctor, and he was listed

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.520
in the credits as having a very relevant name.

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:21.520
What was that name?

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:22.620
A - W.H.O.

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:24.710
Doctor
B - Doctor Tardis

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:31.250
C - Doctor T. Lord
Capaldi's character was credited using the

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:32.250
name W.H.O.

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:33.250
Doctor.

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:37.050
W.H.O. stands for World Health Organisation,
which was the organisation his character worked

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:38.050
for.

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:40.730
The film makers had inside knowledge that
Capaldi would soon be portraying the title

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:47.930
role in Doctor Who and his casting was announced
two months after World War Z was released.
