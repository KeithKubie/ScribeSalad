00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.030
Congratulations, we're now at the end of this course. We're so proud

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:07.200
of you. It's been great to have you with us all this time.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:09.830
&gt;&gt; You're well on your way to building

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:12.460
great applications that run in the Google Cloud.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:13.590
&gt;&gt; But guess what?

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.900
&gt;&gt; We're going to be launching more courses about the Google

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.080
Cloud Platform so make sure you look out for those.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.260
But in this course, you also saw how to build

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.350
a mobile app that can talk to your Google Cloud applications.

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.130
&gt;&gt; Talking of mobile apps, we're going to be launching

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:33.310
a course soon on how to build an Android application.

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:35.960
&gt;&gt; So make sure you look out for that one. But before we

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.900
leave you, just one final thing you have now seen what you can

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.060
do with App Engine today. Let's have Urs HÃ¶lzle a senior VP of

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.930
the infrastructure Google tell you about

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.170
the future of the Google Cloud platform.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.030
So we're back here with Urs. In this course, we learned a lot about App

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.170
Engine. Urs, what can we expect from Google

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.460
Cloud platform and app engine in the future?

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.819
&gt;&gt; A lot of innovation because what I'm really most excited about is that

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:08.900
we're just at the beginning of something that I think is going to be really big.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.720
&gt;&gt; You know, we're proud of what we have today but what we're

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.260
really aiming for is getting to something that five years from now is

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:17.840
so much better.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.630
&gt;&gt; I think the rate of innovation that we're going to see in NetCloud

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.770
is going to pick up and we hope to be a big part of that.

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.730
&gt;&gt; But our goal really is to take what we have and make it so much easier to

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.250
scale, so much easier to program, so much easier

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.360
to be on mobile, so much easier to analyze data.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.090
&gt;&gt; And then really get a platform for you

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.860
that is everything that it is today but much

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:42.470
much better.

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.020
&gt;&gt; Really to the point where, if you remember what you thought was

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.290
great today, we really have a great product that you know five years from

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.860
now you'll kind of remember and say wow, you know, I'm kind of, I was

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.730
naive to think that this was great because if I look at today's product.

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.000
&gt;&gt; You know, was really just the beginning of it that's what I'm most excited

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.140
about. Do you have any final words to the students that have now learned a lot

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.810
about App Engine?

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.729
&gt;&gt; Now that you know App Engine, you're actually in a great

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.610
position to try out other parts of our platform and one of the

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.360
things that we're really going to work on is make it very easy

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:23.648
to combine App Engine with VM's or would be Query or with storage.

00:02:23.648 --> 00:02:28.560
&gt;&gt; So that you can mix and match and implement your application not just in

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.250
pure app engine but really combine in with any other part that we have in our

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.720
infrastructure and still have it be very easy for you to both

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.950
write and run that's the path we're on and I hope you

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.700
enjoyed app engine and you'll enjoy the other parts even more. That's

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.990
right. We've barely started on this

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:50.290
great journey to build Google Cloud applications.

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.170
&gt;&gt; So keep your coding fingers up to date and stay

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.530
on top of what's possible in cloud computing because day by day

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.610
the Google Cloud platform gets better and better. So you can be sure that you'll

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:07.900
always. Build the best applications when you run them on Google Infrastructure.

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:14.684
See you. [NOISE]
