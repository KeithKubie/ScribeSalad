00:00:06.005 --> 00:00:09.009
( intro music )

00:00:12.878 --> 00:00:15.214
<i> This isn't a religious war.</i>

00:00:15.214 --> 00:00:18.318
<i>It's a war whose roots are based</i>

00:00:18.318 --> 00:00:20.186
<i> in poverty, corruption.</i>

00:00:20.953 --> 00:00:23.622
<i> Central African Republic
 for a time</i>

00:00:23.622 --> 00:00:25.125
<i> went psychotic.</i>

00:00:26.425 --> 00:00:29.395
( applause )

00:00:29.395 --> 00:00:31.263
Peter Gwin:
You know here we have a country

00:00:31.263 --> 00:00:33.967
that has 4.5 million people.

00:00:33.967 --> 00:00:36.635
<i> It's a little bit smaller
 than the state of Texas.</i>

00:00:36.635 --> 00:00:40.106
<i> It's 85 percent Christian
or traditional animist beliefs.</i>

00:00:40.106 --> 00:00:42.808
<i> And 15 percent identifies
 as Muslim.</i>

00:00:42.808 --> 00:00:45.645 line:0%
But here's how the people in the
Central African Republic

00:00:45.645 --> 00:00:46.612 line:0%
identify themselves.

00:00:46.812 --> 00:00:48.447
<i> I'm going to refer to the
 Central African Republic</i>

00:00:48.447 --> 00:00:50.816
<i> by the shorthand that we
 sort of all default to CAR,</i>

00:00:50.816 --> 00:00:53.820
<i> so if you are confused
that's what I am talking about.</i>

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.189
<i> This is a map from
 a high school geography book.</i>

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:59.391
<i>And it shows the ethnic groups.</i>

00:00:59.391 --> 00:01:02.027
<i> And there are more than 50
 ethnic groups and sub-groups.</i>

00:01:02.027 --> 00:01:05.464
<i> It's also a nation filled with
 treasure literally.</i>

00:01:05.464 --> 00:01:07.400
<i>Fairly famous for its diamonds.</i>

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.201
<i> One of the biggest diamonds
 ever found,</i>

00:01:09.201 --> 00:01:12.205
<i> almost 400 carats
 was found in the CAR.</i>

00:01:12.205 --> 00:01:13.673
<i> It also has gold mines.</i>

00:01:13.673 --> 00:01:17.677
<i> Both of these resources are
 mined using artisanal methods,</i>

00:01:17.677 --> 00:01:19.845
<i> that means it's not
 an industrial scale thing.</i>

00:01:19.845 --> 00:01:22.749
It's all like open-pit mine,
digging like that.

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:25.485
<i> In recent years,
 petroleum has been found</i>

00:01:25.485 --> 00:01:27.854
<i> up near the Chad border.</i>

00:01:27.854 --> 00:01:30.756
And, there's also
deposits of uranium.

00:01:30.756 --> 00:01:33.493
France's first atomic weapon
came from uranium

00:01:33.493 --> 00:01:35.495
that was mined in the CAR.

00:01:35.495 --> 00:01:39.031
It also has huge reserves of
timber, game animals,

00:01:39.031 --> 00:01:43.135
but also the potential
for hydropower.

00:01:43.135 --> 00:01:44.604
So what went wrong?
What happened?

00:01:44.604 --> 00:01:47.139
Usually this is
the equation for...

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:48.141
for prosperity, right?

00:01:48.141 --> 00:01:50.877
You have a fairly
good-sized country,

00:01:50.877 --> 00:01:53.879
with a relatively
small population

00:01:53.879 --> 00:01:56.348
and all these resources.
So, you know,

00:01:56.348 --> 00:01:58.518
why are we where we are today?

00:01:58.518 --> 00:02:02.188
<i> And a lot of the answer has to
 lie at the feet of these men.</i>

00:02:02.188 --> 00:02:03.989
<i> These are the six leaders</i>

00:02:03.989 --> 00:02:06.358
<i>of the Central African Republic
 since independence.</i>

00:02:06.358 --> 00:02:08.895
<i> This is a monument in Bangui.</i>

00:02:08.895 --> 00:02:10.797
<i> It was erected in 2008,</i>

00:02:10.797 --> 00:02:13.332
<i> which was the 50th anniversary
 of independence.</i>

00:02:13.332 --> 00:02:16.835
<i> And each person on each
 one of these gold busts</i>

00:02:16.835 --> 00:02:18.971
<i> betrayed one of the
 guys up here.</i>

00:02:18.971 --> 00:02:21.273
<i> The guy that takes
 the cake of the leaders</i>

00:02:21.273 --> 00:02:23.375
<i> in terms of driving
 the country into the ground</i>

00:02:23.375 --> 00:02:26.011
<i> is this guy,
 Jean-Bédel Bokassa.</i>

00:02:26.011 --> 00:02:28.013
<i> He was the president for life</i>

00:02:28.013 --> 00:02:29.916
<i> and then decided that
 wasn't a grand enough title,</i>

00:02:29.916 --> 00:02:32.017
<i> so he decided to
 become the Emperor</i>

00:02:32.017 --> 00:02:34.353
<i> of the Central African Empire.</i>

00:02:34.353 --> 00:02:35.922
<i> He was going to rename
 the whole country.</i>

00:02:35.922 --> 00:02:38.925
<i> He styled himself sort
 of the Napoleon of Africa.</i>

00:02:38.925 --> 00:02:42.294
And in an era when we saw
Muammar Gaddafi rise,

00:02:42.294 --> 00:02:44.296
Idi Amin was in his day,

00:02:44.296 --> 00:02:46.632
Mobutu Sese Seko was there,

00:02:46.632 --> 00:02:49.635
Bokassa gives them
all a run for their money.

00:02:49.635 --> 00:02:53.572
He actually met his nadir when

00:02:53.572 --> 00:02:55.408
he decreed that
all school children

00:02:55.408 --> 00:02:58.110
had to buy their school
uniforms from his,

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.779
a company that he owned.

00:02:59.779 --> 00:03:02.215
And when they had...
a rebellion,

00:03:02.215 --> 00:03:03.482
when there was a protest,

00:03:03.482 --> 00:03:05.784
he had a hundred of
them arrested,

00:03:05.784 --> 00:03:07.386
many were beaten, some killed

00:03:07.386 --> 00:03:08.855
and that was sort
of the moment that he...

00:03:08.855 --> 00:03:10.289
he met his downfall.

00:03:11.057 --> 00:03:12.691
<i> Another issue
 that's been happening</i>

00:03:12.691 --> 00:03:14.160
<i> over the past 10 years or so,</i>

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.229
<i> more than that but 10 years is
really the area that we focus on</i>

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:19.198
<i> is poaching the game.</i>

00:03:19.198 --> 00:03:21.433
<i> And specifically
 the forest elephants.</i>

00:03:21.433 --> 00:03:23.936
Poachers have been
coming to the CAR

00:03:23.936 --> 00:03:27.373
mostly from Sudan
in organized fashion.

00:03:27.373 --> 00:03:28.975
Many of these are Janjaweed.

00:03:28.975 --> 00:03:30.809
In fact one man described
it to me

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:33.346
as "it's an ivory bank account".

00:03:33.346 --> 00:03:36.315
We just come when
we need money.

00:03:36.315 --> 00:03:37.283
In the past ten years,

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.020
I think they estimate
5,500 elephants have been killed

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.422
for their ivory.

00:03:43.422 --> 00:03:45.891
And that's about 62 percent
of the population.

00:03:45.891 --> 00:03:48.628
So,
only about 30 percent remain.

00:03:50.463 --> 00:03:53.332
<i> The Séléka are a
 group of militias</i>

00:03:53.332 --> 00:03:55.835
<i> predominantly from the north,
 Muslim based.</i>

00:03:55.835 --> 00:04:00.606
<i> And funded by Chad to come and
 fight the Bozizé government.</i>

00:04:00.606 --> 00:04:03.776
<i> They were opposed
 by the anti-balaka,</i>

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.713
<i> begun as a sort of a local
 neighborhood security force.</i>

00:04:07.713 --> 00:04:09.415
<i> When the Séléka rose up,</i>

00:04:09.415 --> 00:04:10.716
<i> these guys organized,</i>

00:04:10.716 --> 00:04:12.651
<i> they realized they needed
 some protection.</i>

00:04:12.651 --> 00:04:14.020
<i> Once the Séléka were gone</i>

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:17.590
<i> they took out reprisals on
 the Muslim population.</i>

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.291
<i> They committed many
 of the same atrocities</i>

00:04:19.291 --> 00:04:20.993
<i> the Séléka had committed.</i>

00:04:20.993 --> 00:04:23.028
So that's not the
whole story though.

00:04:23.028 --> 00:04:25.531
<i>That's just what's happening in</i>

00:04:25.531 --> 00:04:27.433
<i> predominantly the East
 and the North of the country.</i>

00:04:27.433 --> 00:04:30.769
<i> There's another conflict
 that's going on-- far away,</i>

00:04:30.769 --> 00:04:33.372
<i> in the far eastern corner</i>

00:04:33.372 --> 00:04:35.107
<i>is a little village called Obo.</i>

00:04:35.107 --> 00:04:37.643
<i> It's a village of
 about 6,000 people.</i>

00:04:37.643 --> 00:04:41.079
<i> In Obo,
 we don't have the Séléka,</i>

00:04:41.079 --> 00:04:44.283
<i> we don't have concerns
 about anti-balaka.</i>

00:04:44.283 --> 00:04:48.086
<i> These are both Muslim and
 Christian children playing.</i>

00:04:48.086 --> 00:04:52.091
<i> These children are also under
 threat from another place.</i>

00:04:52.091 --> 00:04:54.661
<i> And that is,
 remember this guy?</i>

00:04:54.661 --> 00:04:57.063
<i> Joseph Kony rose to fame
 a couple of years ago,</i>

00:04:57.063 --> 00:04:59.765
<i> with the Kony 2012 video
 that went viral.</i>

00:04:59.765 --> 00:05:01.234
<i> For those of you
 who don't know the story,</i>

00:05:01.234 --> 00:05:02.868
<i> he is a Ugandan warlord</i>

00:05:02.868 --> 00:05:05.537
<i> who for the better part
 of the last two decades</i>

00:05:05.537 --> 00:05:08.240
has been kidnapping children

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.009
to fight in his guerilla army

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:14.814
and he sort of moved from
South Sudan to the DRC,

00:05:14.814 --> 00:05:17.950
and now he's found his way

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:21.120
into the
Central African Republic.

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.524
And, especially given
the security situation

00:05:24.524 --> 00:05:28.127
that we have been
facing in CAR

00:05:28.127 --> 00:05:30.463
over the past year or so,

00:05:30.463 --> 00:05:33.398
his forces have moved,
you know,

00:05:33.398 --> 00:05:35.534
more forcefully into this area.

00:05:35.534 --> 00:05:38.070
But what's keeping
the people in Obo

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:40.273
safe for the moment--

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:42.575
is your tax dollars.

00:05:43.309 --> 00:05:45.378
<i> This is actually a
 Special Forces,</i>

00:05:45.378 --> 00:05:47.179
<i> US Special Forces base.</i>

00:05:47.179 --> 00:05:50.115
<i> It sits right on the
 corner of the village.</i>

00:05:50.115 --> 00:05:53.986
And the US has been there
for three years now, actually.

00:05:53.986 --> 00:05:57.122
In part providing security

00:05:57.122 --> 00:05:59.992
but in large part
training Ugandan troops

00:05:59.992 --> 00:06:03.563
and advising them on
tracking Kony and his...

00:06:03.563 --> 00:06:05.564
and his group.

00:06:05.564 --> 00:06:08.167
<i> So these are the Ugandan
 troops that they train.</i>

00:06:08.167 --> 00:06:10.102
<i> What's different
 apparently about this is</i>

00:06:10.102 --> 00:06:13.038
<i> that they are actually getting
 jungle war fighting training</i>

00:06:13.038 --> 00:06:16.775
<i> before they are sent actually
 to track Kony and his men.</i>

00:06:16.775 --> 00:06:18.777
And when I talk to people
in the village are they happy

00:06:18.777 --> 00:06:20.078
that these guys are here,
they said,

00:06:20.078 --> 00:06:23.282
if the United States
and Uganda wasn't here,

00:06:23.282 --> 00:06:26.218
Joseph Kony would be
sleeping in Obo tonight.

00:06:26.218 --> 00:06:29.554
But I understand human nature,
you want to put some faces,

00:06:29.554 --> 00:06:32.625
specific faces on these issues.

00:06:32.625 --> 00:06:34.327
So, I want to introduce you to
three people,

00:06:34.327 --> 00:06:38.730
so the next time you see
a random CAR news report

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:41.767
or a 500-word AP story perhaps,

00:06:41.767 --> 00:06:44.736
you'll think of these
three people. So...

00:06:44.736 --> 00:06:48.241
<i>This is Aramis. He is from Obo.</i>

00:06:48.241 --> 00:06:50.842
<i> And he was kidnapped
 when he was 17 years old</i>

00:06:50.842 --> 00:06:52.811
<i> at his grandfather's house.</i>

00:06:52.811 --> 00:06:55.848
<i> And taken by the LRA
 into the jungle.</i>

00:06:55.848 --> 00:06:58.183
<i> He spent five years
 as a guerrilla fighter.</i>

00:06:58.183 --> 00:07:00.385
<i> He had horrible things
 done to him.</i>

00:07:00.385 --> 00:07:02.488
<i> And he did horrible things.</i>

00:07:03.288 --> 00:07:06.091
But he escaped about a year ago.

00:07:06.091 --> 00:07:10.362
And now he works with
the US and Ugandans

00:07:10.362 --> 00:07:14.433
to broadcast radio messages
into the jungle.

00:07:14.433 --> 00:07:17.036
And basically they are trying to
encourage the fighthers

00:07:17.036 --> 00:07:18.237
to give themselves up,

00:07:18.237 --> 00:07:20.205
just like Aramis did.

00:07:20.205 --> 00:07:23.208
And that's been a pretty
successful strategy.

00:07:23.208 --> 00:07:26.511
But so, once a week Aramis goes
into the radio station

00:07:26.511 --> 00:07:28.847
and basically talks to
his former comrades.

00:07:28.847 --> 00:07:30.949
And I sat in on
one of the sessions.

00:07:30.949 --> 00:07:33.385
And you know,
he calls them by name,

00:07:33.385 --> 00:07:36.389
he tells them, you know, your...

00:07:36.389 --> 00:07:37.823
you know,
your family wants you home.

00:07:37.823 --> 00:07:39.357
There's amnesty for anybody.

00:07:39.357 --> 00:07:40.892
The guys that they are really,

00:07:40.892 --> 00:07:43.262
basically going after
these days are Kony

00:07:43.262 --> 00:07:45.464
and the other leaders.

00:07:45.464 --> 00:07:49.368
<i> Another guy that I'd like you
 to meet is Albert.</i>

00:07:49.368 --> 00:07:52.538
<i> So, Albert I met on a trip
 this summer to Bangui.</i>

00:07:52.538 --> 00:07:56.175
<i> I'd barely gotten, you know,
 into the city and he was</i>

00:07:56.208 --> 00:08:00.045
<i> knocking on my door wanting to
 sell me something, you know.</i>

00:08:00.045 --> 00:08:02.681
He kept saying,
"I want you to buy
these pictures.

00:08:02.681 --> 00:08:04.716
I've got these great pictures."
And I was looking
at the pictures,

00:08:04.716 --> 00:08:06.718
like picture of a chicken,
you know,

00:08:06.718 --> 00:08:08.687
<i> "Man, do I really want
 a chicken picture?</i>

00:08:08.687 --> 00:08:10.022
( audience laughing )

00:08:10.022 --> 00:08:12.591
<i>And you know, I am sitting there
 looking at this thing</i>

00:08:12.591 --> 00:08:14.493
<i> and then I realized</i>

00:08:14.493 --> 00:08:18.397
<i> it's made out of
 butterfly wings.</i>

00:08:18.397 --> 00:08:20.432
<i> And I was blown away.</i>

00:08:20.432 --> 00:08:22.335
<i> So, he took me
 back to his workshop</i>

00:08:22.335 --> 00:08:23.368
<i> and he showed me
 how he does these.</i>

00:08:23.368 --> 00:08:25.738
<i> He collects these
 butterflies meticulously</i>

00:08:25.738 --> 00:08:30.242
<i> and makes these
 stained glass images of life</i>

00:08:30.242 --> 00:08:33.145
<i>in the Central African Republic.</i>

00:08:33.145 --> 00:08:35.581
<i> Boy climbing a tree.</i>

00:08:35.581 --> 00:08:38.050
<i> And this picture has
 special significance</i>

00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:40.252
<i> because it's his sister.</i>

00:08:40.252 --> 00:08:43.589
<i> And she was killed by
 the Séléka early this Spring.</i>

00:08:46.058 --> 00:08:48.494
Lastly, I want to
introduce you to the

00:08:48.494 --> 00:08:50.762
National Ballet of the
Central African Republic.

00:08:50.762 --> 00:08:52.565
They perform ethnic dances,

00:08:52.565 --> 00:08:53.865
so there's dancers
from all those

00:08:53.865 --> 00:08:56.168
ethnic communities
that I showed you.

00:08:56.168 --> 00:08:59.004
They are missing 14 of
their members since the violence

00:08:59.004 --> 00:09:01.340
and their rehearsal space
has been completely destroyed.

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:04.610
So, they perform--

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:07.713
They perform in a vacant lot
in downtown Bangui.

00:09:07.713 --> 00:09:11.250
And people just come and watch,
it's like free performances.

00:09:12.518 --> 00:09:13.852
<i> And I happened to come
 by one day</i>

00:09:13.852 --> 00:09:15.120
<i> when they were performing
 this piece,</i>

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:17.056
<i>which is actually a pygmy dance.</i>

00:09:17.056 --> 00:09:19.491
<i> And it tells the
 story of two women</i>

00:09:19.491 --> 00:09:22.627
<i> who are rivals for
 the affections of a man.</i>

00:09:22.627 --> 00:09:26.632
<i> And one of the women
 poisons her rival,</i>

00:09:26.632 --> 00:09:30.635
<i> and so an old healer is
 brought in</i>

00:09:30.635 --> 00:09:32.838
<i> to raise this woman
 from the dead.</i>

00:09:32.838 --> 00:09:35.040
<i> And this is the scene
 that you are going to see.</i>

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:39.145
( singing in Sangho )

00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:50.056
( ethnic music )

00:10:06.738 --> 00:10:09.141
So, now I'm going to
pass it over to Marcus.

00:10:10.375 --> 00:10:14.547
( applause )

00:10:20.886 --> 00:10:22.988
Marcus Bleasdale:
Thanks, Peter, for that.

00:10:22.988 --> 00:10:25.324 line:0%
I think it's really
important to highlight

00:10:25.324 --> 00:10:29.061 line:0%
very early on in this
evening that

00:10:29.061 --> 00:10:31.797
this isn't a religious war.

00:10:31.797 --> 00:10:34.433
It's a war

00:10:34.433 --> 00:10:37.069
whose roots are based

00:10:37.069 --> 00:10:39.605
fundamentally in poverty.

00:10:39.605 --> 00:10:42.074
It's based in corruption.

00:10:42.074 --> 00:10:44.109
It's based in mismanagement,

00:10:44.109 --> 00:10:46.211
bad leadership,
many of which, you know,

00:10:46.211 --> 00:10:49.080
the leaders we were introduced
to through Peter tonight.

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:52.117
And... religion has been used by

00:10:52.117 --> 00:10:54.987
the perpetrators to draw lines,

00:10:54.987 --> 00:10:59.758
to draw allegiances and
to try to create power.

00:10:59.758 --> 00:11:02.227
So, I think we should try to
rise above that this evening,

00:11:02.227 --> 00:11:04.229
and try to think in
a much more complex way

00:11:04.229 --> 00:11:07.099
about what is driving
this conflict.

00:11:07.099 --> 00:11:10.202
<i> What I'd like to do is
 to introduce you</i>

00:11:10.202 --> 00:11:13.171
<i> to the chronology
 of the conflict.</i>

00:11:13.171 --> 00:11:16.609
It started as we were
introduced to earlier on that

00:11:16.609 --> 00:11:19.111
the Séléka were funded by

00:11:19.111 --> 00:11:21.146
Idriss Deby, Chad
to come in and destabilize

00:11:21.146 --> 00:11:22.247
the Central African Republic,

00:11:22.247 --> 00:11:25.584
maybe take resources,
send those back to Chad

00:11:25.584 --> 00:11:28.621
but also destabilize the
Central African Republic,

00:11:28.621 --> 00:11:31.590
for the benefit of
its neighbors.

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:34.793
And so this Séléka
group that was--

00:11:34.793 --> 00:11:36.629
that came into the country...

00:11:38.963 --> 00:11:41.099
attacked the then government,

00:11:41.099 --> 00:11:44.469
took power
from the government and...

00:11:44.469 --> 00:11:47.572
and then started to
rule over the population

00:11:47.572 --> 00:11:50.242
in a very authoritarian way.

00:11:50.242 --> 00:11:54.747
And the people who suffered
most under that very
early Séléka rule

00:11:54.747 --> 00:11:57.315
were the Christians.

00:11:57.315 --> 00:11:59.351
They were the ones that
were forced out of their homes

00:11:59.351 --> 00:12:01.921
because they were
persecuted by the rebels,

00:12:01.921 --> 00:12:04.623
that were working
in different zones.

00:12:04.623 --> 00:12:07.993
And many of these Sélékas
have gone kinda AWOL.

00:12:07.993 --> 00:12:10.796
They were funded to an
extent by external powers,

00:12:10.796 --> 00:12:12.998
they were funded to
an extent by their leaders,

00:12:12.998 --> 00:12:14.566
but they were also
working for themselves.

00:12:14.566 --> 00:12:18.471
They were also trying to fund
their own lives and their own,

00:12:18.471 --> 00:12:21.373
their own personal
wealth gathering

00:12:21.373 --> 00:12:25.644
through looting,
through killing,
through amassing wealth,

00:12:25.644 --> 00:12:28.080
through stealing property.

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:29.915
And that insecurity

00:12:29.915 --> 00:12:31.650
of these Séléka coming
into the regions

00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:33.986
where predominantly Christian
populations were living

00:12:33.986 --> 00:12:36.655
led the Christian population
to flee into the bush.

00:12:36.655 --> 00:12:39.825
So, I'd like you to try to
kind of put yourself
into that context

00:12:39.825 --> 00:12:42.160
when I show you the next
series of images because

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:43.462
essentially these,

00:12:43.462 --> 00:12:44.530
the next series of images

00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:46.265
I'm going to try and
put you into that

00:12:46.265 --> 00:12:49.001
early stages as
the Séléka is ruling

00:12:49.001 --> 00:12:53.472
and the Christian population has
been persecuted and are fleeing.

00:12:54.773 --> 00:12:58.309
<i>This is an image in a compound,
 in a town called Bossangoa.</i>

00:12:58.309 --> 00:13:00.011
<i> It was taken in December 2013,</i>

00:13:00.011 --> 00:13:02.213
<i> and this is a mother
 trying to protect her child</i>

00:13:02.213 --> 00:13:05.016
<i>from the gun fire and the RPG's
 that are flying all around</i>

00:13:05.016 --> 00:13:08.220
<i> this compound as the
 Muslim Séléka</i>

00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:11.356
<i> are coming in to attack
 the town of Bossangoa,</i>

00:13:11.356 --> 00:13:14.726
<i> where there are about
 10,000 Muslim refugees</i>

00:13:14.726 --> 00:13:17.128
<i> staying in the local
 school and about</i>

00:13:17.128 --> 00:13:20.499
<i> 30,000 Christians displaced
 staying in the church.</i>

00:13:21.133 --> 00:13:25.003
<i> This is a young girl
 who was injured in a fighting</i>

00:13:25.003 --> 00:13:27.739
<i> as she tried to
 flee to the FOMAC base,</i>

00:13:27.739 --> 00:13:30.809
<i> which is where
 now I am living with</i>

00:13:30.809 --> 00:13:33.011
<i> about 5,000 displaced people.</i>

00:13:33.011 --> 00:13:36.214
<i> The fight is going on outside
 the walls of this compound</i>

00:13:36.214 --> 00:13:39.151
And where they are protected by

00:13:39.151 --> 00:13:42.320
a small group of
Congolese soldiers.

00:13:42.954 --> 00:13:45.991
<i>This image was taken very early
in the morning about 5 o'clock,</i>

00:13:45.991 --> 00:13:48.961
<i> just as the sun
 is starting to rise.</i>

00:13:48.961 --> 00:13:52.430
<i> And normally about the
 time when,</i>

00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:54.466
<i> if a town is going to
 be attacked, it is attacked.</i>

00:13:54.466 --> 00:13:58.904
<i> And this is the time when the
Séléka were coming in Bossangoa</i>

00:13:58.904 --> 00:14:02.107
<i> and the local population had
 amassed around the FOMAC base</i>

00:14:02.107 --> 00:14:05.176
<i> because they could feel it,
 they could hear it,
 they could...</i>

00:14:05.176 --> 00:14:07.880
<i> villages like this,
 small as they are,</i>

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:11.317
<i> start to feel that there is
 something wrong quite early.</i>

00:14:11.317 --> 00:14:14.853
<i> And so this population is
 kinda waiting at the
 FOMAC base to flee,</i>

00:14:14.853 --> 00:14:16.855
<i>so that they can get sanctuary.</i>

00:14:16.855 --> 00:14:19.358
<i> And this is in the
 local hospital</i>

00:14:19.358 --> 00:14:21.726
<i> that was being run
 by Doctors Without Borders,</i>

00:14:21.726 --> 00:14:23.128
<i> Médecins Sans Frontières.</i>

00:14:23.128 --> 00:14:25.564
<i> And ironically,
 here we have on right side</i>

00:14:25.564 --> 00:14:29.701
<i> an anti-balaka fighter and his
 wife and child in the middle,</i>

00:14:29.701 --> 00:14:32.370
<i> and on the left side
 is a Séléka fighter.</i>

00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:35.307
<i>Both sitting, lying side-by-side</i>

00:14:35.307 --> 00:14:38.110
<i> receiving the same medical
 care from the same doctor.</i>

00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:41.146
<i>And living in perfect harmony as
they had done before the battle.</i>

00:14:41.146 --> 00:14:44.883
<i> As their populations had done
 for many generations before.</i>

00:14:44.883 --> 00:14:48.754
<i> And children have played
 a large part in this conflict</i>

00:14:48.754 --> 00:14:53.892
<i> and this young Séléka fighter
was actually brought from Sudan.</i>

00:14:53.892 --> 00:14:55.693
<i> So he is Sudanese,</i>

00:14:55.693 --> 00:14:58.197
<i> came through Chad and
 is now fighting in</i>

00:14:58.197 --> 00:15:00.832
<i> Central African Republic
 for the Séléka.</i>

00:15:00.832 --> 00:15:02.801
<i> And he is about 14 years old .</i>

00:15:02.801 --> 00:15:04.936
Very few people really
know their age

00:15:04.936 --> 00:15:07.539
<i>but very clearly he is underage.</i>

00:15:07.539 --> 00:15:09.341
<i> And both sides
 were using children,</i>

00:15:09.341 --> 00:15:11.677
<i> and still are using
 children in the fight.</i>

00:15:12.678 --> 00:15:15.147
We talk about Muslim

00:15:15.147 --> 00:15:17.816
and we talk about anti-balaka
and the Christian

00:15:17.816 --> 00:15:20.052
and the animists population
but also there are

00:15:20.052 --> 00:15:21.920
<i> kind of cultural
 group called the "Peul",</i>

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:23.388
<i> who are the nomadic herders,</i>

00:15:23.388 --> 00:15:25.490
<i> the people that look after
 the cattle</i>

00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:28.994
<i> and they have enormous wealth
 all embedded in cattle.</i>

00:15:28.994 --> 00:15:30.762
And they wander through
this whole region

00:15:30.762 --> 00:15:33.097
they wander through Cameroon,

00:15:33.097 --> 00:15:35.066
Chad, Central African Republic

00:15:35.066 --> 00:15:37.769
and they follow the
rains as the rains move,

00:15:37.769 --> 00:15:40.605
they move their cattle
and the cattle graze

00:15:40.605 --> 00:15:42.841
and they move through
this whole region.

00:15:42.841 --> 00:15:45.210
They don't consider themselves
from Central African Republic

00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:47.980
or Chad or Cameroon,
they are from their region.

00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:50.915
And they were hugely
persecuted by the anti-balaka

00:15:50.915 --> 00:15:53.885
during this time because
they were the source of beef.

00:15:53.885 --> 00:15:56.488
They were also
pre-dominantly Muslim

00:15:56.488 --> 00:15:57.489
and so they were focused...

00:15:57.589 --> 00:15:59.858
the anti-balaka focused
on them for that as well and

00:15:59.858 --> 00:16:03.963
<i> this young woman saw her whole
 family massacred around her,</i>

00:16:03.963 --> 00:16:07.132
<i> her 12 children and
 her husband were killed</i>

00:16:07.132 --> 00:16:09.301
<i> and she was shot
 in the back of the head</i>

00:16:09.301 --> 00:16:10.736
<i> and was left for dead</i>

00:16:10.736 --> 00:16:13.338
<i> and she was only found
 by a group of Peul herders</i>

00:16:13.338 --> 00:16:15.740
<i> about five or six days later.</i>

00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:17.842
And they brought her near dead

00:16:17.842 --> 00:16:22.114
to the hospital where she was
cared for and survived.

00:16:22.114 --> 00:16:25.017
But she still has the bullet
in the back of her skull.

00:16:26.651 --> 00:16:28.520
<i>This is the church in Bossangoa,</i>

00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:31.656
<i> the displaced camp for
 the Christian population</i>

00:16:31.656 --> 00:16:33.958
<i> about 30,000 people
 were there...</i>

00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:35.861
<i> and are still there actually.</i>

00:16:35.861 --> 00:16:38.630
<i> And this is a Peul
 lady who lost her husband,</i>

00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:40.299
<i> she lost five of her children</i>

00:16:40.299 --> 00:16:43.368
<i>and the only reason that she sat
 there with her young boy here</i>

00:16:43.368 --> 00:16:45.537
<i> was because she dressed
 him up as a girl</i>

00:16:45.537 --> 00:16:49.407
<i> and was allowed to leave
 the village that she was in</i>

00:16:49.407 --> 00:16:52.143
<i> because the group of
 anti-balaka that she was with,</i>

00:16:52.143 --> 00:16:53.578
<i> were not killing the
 young girls,</i>

00:16:53.578 --> 00:16:55.347
<i> they were just killing boys.</i>

00:16:55.347 --> 00:16:56.949
<i> This is inside the church,</i>

00:16:56.949 --> 00:16:59.351
<i> the displaced camp</i>

00:16:59.351 --> 00:17:02.521
<i> and the young girl in front
 you see here sat on the chair,</i>

00:17:02.521 --> 00:17:04.656
<i> she is 13 years old.</i>

00:17:04.656 --> 00:17:07.726
<i>She sat there with her daughter</i>

00:17:07.726 --> 00:17:10.829
<i> and this is another issue
 that we have in
 Central African Republic.</i>

00:17:10.829 --> 00:17:14.499
<i> The concept of child
 marriages is prolific.</i>

00:17:14.499 --> 00:17:17.135
<i> And we came across it in
 every town that we went to,</i>

00:17:17.135 --> 00:17:19.171
<i> every displaced
 camp that we went to.</i>

00:17:19.838 --> 00:17:21.840
<i> For a lot of the time
 the anti-balaka were</i>

00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:24.643
<i> in these bushes
 hiding away like this</i>

00:17:24.643 --> 00:17:26.678
<i> and then things changed.</i>

00:17:26.678 --> 00:17:28.180
December came around

00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:30.916
and the anti-balakas started
organizing themselves

00:17:30.916 --> 00:17:34.386
and they became stronger
to try and come and fight

00:17:34.386 --> 00:17:37.289
and engaged the Séléka
in a more active way.

00:17:37.289 --> 00:17:39.958
And the Séléka were told
you cannot treat your people

00:17:39.958 --> 00:17:41.393
with such disdain,

00:17:41.393 --> 00:17:43.828
you cannot treat your
people with such hatred

00:17:43.828 --> 00:17:46.698
and expect them not
to rebel against you.

00:17:46.698 --> 00:17:48.533
And time and time and time again

00:17:48.533 --> 00:17:50.969
organizations,
NGOs, human rights organizations

00:17:50.969 --> 00:17:53.038
told them this
and they ignored it.

00:17:53.038 --> 00:17:54.506
<i> And the anti-balaka,</i>

00:17:54.506 --> 00:17:56.842
<i> the Christian population
 came out of the bush.</i>

00:17:56.842 --> 00:17:59.844
<i> The anit-balaka came
 out of the bush, strong,</i>

00:17:59.844 --> 00:18:02.581
<i>motivated and very, very angry.</i>

00:18:02.581 --> 00:18:06.617
<i> They started to rise up and
 attack the local population,</i>

00:18:06.617 --> 00:18:08.353
<i> sometimes the local
 Muslim population,</i>

00:18:08.353 --> 00:18:10.555
<i> sometimes they were
 just taking things</i>

00:18:10.555 --> 00:18:13.958
<i>to try to enhance their strength
 and have their assets.</i>

00:18:13.958 --> 00:18:17.162
<i> This of course led to
 the local Muslim population</i>

00:18:17.162 --> 00:18:19.831
<i> and the Peul population,
 the nomads</i>

00:18:19.831 --> 00:18:22.267
<i> to flee and to
 try to find sanctuary</i>

00:18:22.267 --> 00:18:26.271
<i>and here we have Peul population
 hiding in a Christian church,</i>

00:18:26.271 --> 00:18:28.773
<i> protected by the priest
 in that Christian church.</i>

00:18:28.773 --> 00:18:30.275
<i> And this town is in Boali.</i>

00:18:30.275 --> 00:18:33.411
<i> And many of the priests
 in the churches all around</i>

00:18:33.411 --> 00:18:35.214
<i> Central African Republic were</i>

00:18:35.214 --> 00:18:38.150
<i> really sanctuaries for the
 Muslim population.</i>

00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:41.553
They opened their doors in order
to protect the Muslim population

00:18:41.553 --> 00:18:45.657
from their own
Christian followers.

00:18:46.325 --> 00:18:49.661
<i> This rise of the anti-balaka
 lead the Muslim population</i>

00:18:49.661 --> 00:18:51.429
<i> deciding to relocate.</i>

00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:55.633
<i> This is a Muslim man,
 what happened when
 these enclaves</i>

00:18:55.633 --> 00:18:58.703
<i> were created is that the
 anti-balaka then started</i>

00:18:58.703 --> 00:19:01.106
<i> picking off the Muslims
 on the edges.</i>

00:19:01.106 --> 00:19:04.142
Firing, throwing grenades,
throwing RPGs,

00:19:04.142 --> 00:19:07.412
and slowly this Muslim
population started to be killed.

00:19:08.413 --> 00:19:10.182
<i> They were waiting
 there in these enclaves</i>

00:19:10.182 --> 00:19:11.616
<i> where people were trapped,
 they couldn't leave,</i>

00:19:11.616 --> 00:19:13.885
<i> they couldn't go anywhere,
they were completely surrounded</i>

00:19:13.885 --> 00:19:16.622
<i> by anti-balaka and
 there was no way out safely,</i>

00:19:16.622 --> 00:19:17.389
<i> no way out.</i>

00:19:17.389 --> 00:19:19.925
And the United Nations,

00:19:19.925 --> 00:19:21.493
for much as though
they were there to protect

00:19:21.493 --> 00:19:25.130
they were also very fearful
at the beginning to...

00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:30.168
to contribute and
assist ethnic cleansing.

00:19:30.168 --> 00:19:31.836
And so these people were trapped

00:19:31.836 --> 00:19:35.707
in these zones and were
being killed on a daily basis.

00:19:35.707 --> 00:19:38.810
<i> This young man was
demonstrating against the state</i>

00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:41.046
that the Muslims were being
held in,

00:19:41.046 --> 00:19:43.748
<i> and was shot by
 a French peacekeepers.</i>

00:19:43.748 --> 00:19:45.584
<i>And his wife a few minutes later</i>

00:19:45.584 --> 00:19:48.620
<i> finding out that her
 husband has been killed.</i>

00:19:51.689 --> 00:19:53.858
As the Séléka started to leave,

00:19:53.858 --> 00:19:55.928
as the rise of the
anti-balaka increased

00:19:55.928 --> 00:19:57.662
the Séléka started
to decide to go,

00:19:57.662 --> 00:19:59.698
they started to kidnap people

00:19:59.698 --> 00:20:01.332
and they started to take them
to help them,

00:20:01.332 --> 00:20:02.867
carry the baggage much as the...

00:20:02.867 --> 00:20:04.902
we see with the
LRA carrying baggage

00:20:04.902 --> 00:20:06.971
to move it out of the country.

00:20:06.971 --> 00:20:10.075
Many of the local
population was kidnapped

00:20:10.075 --> 00:20:12.711
by the Séléka and to take them
out of country

00:20:12.711 --> 00:20:14.112
and this actually is a man

00:20:14.112 --> 00:20:16.748
<i> I met on the street about 50
 kilometers outside of Bangui</i>

00:20:16.748 --> 00:20:18.983
<i> and he'd been kidnapped
 by the Séléka.</i>

00:20:18.983 --> 00:20:21.419
<i> Spent nine days carrying
 baggage with the Séléka</i>

00:20:21.419 --> 00:20:22.687
<i> being beaten everyday</i>

00:20:22.687 --> 00:20:24.989
to move quicker, move quicker,
you know,

00:20:24.989 --> 00:20:27.458
don't stop because we need
to leave this area very quickly

00:20:27.458 --> 00:20:28.326
because we are gonna be killed

00:20:28.526 --> 00:20:30.895
and he was being beaten
to carry all the baggage,

00:20:30.895 --> 00:20:33.098
he managed to escape
with his father

00:20:33.098 --> 00:20:36.134
and we found him on the side of
the road emaciated and hungry

00:20:36.134 --> 00:20:38.670
and tired and
we put him in our car

00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:40.972
and brought him back to Bangui
and this is the moment,

00:20:40.972 --> 00:20:43.441
a very privileged
moment that we have

00:20:43.441 --> 00:20:45.810
of taking him home

00:20:45.810 --> 00:20:47.812
and introducing him
once more to his mother

00:20:47.812 --> 00:20:49.748
who thought he'd been killed.

00:20:51.382 --> 00:20:53.585
<i> The anti-balaka rise up and</i>

00:20:53.585 --> 00:20:56.221
<i> continue to destroy
 the Muslim properties</i>

00:20:56.221 --> 00:21:00.125
<i> and here we see one
 of the main colonels,</i>

00:21:00.125 --> 00:21:02.927
<i> Colonel Dieudonné
 of the anti-balaka</i>

00:21:02.927 --> 00:21:06.698
<i> with his gris-gris
 and his grenades,</i>

00:21:06.698 --> 00:21:08.800
<i> ready for the fight.</i>

00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:11.069
And this is essentially
what happened after that.

00:21:11.069 --> 00:21:13.839
The Séléka now left Bangui,

00:21:13.839 --> 00:21:16.541
there is no one to protect
the Muslim population

00:21:16.541 --> 00:21:17.709
and so the...

00:21:17.709 --> 00:21:20.077
for a period of time between

00:21:20.077 --> 00:21:22.714
the last week in January perhaps

00:21:22.714 --> 00:21:25.483
and the middle of March,

00:21:25.483 --> 00:21:28.253
the way I describe it is that
the country

00:21:28.253 --> 00:21:30.888
for a time went psychotic.

00:21:31.656 --> 00:21:34.025
<i> There was killing
 on a scale I've never seen</i>

00:21:34.025 --> 00:21:36.828
<i> in 16 years covering
 conflict in Africa.</i>

00:21:36.828 --> 00:21:39.697
<i>And imagery that I prefer really
 not to have in my mind,</i>

00:21:39.697 --> 00:21:42.334
<i> but it's important that we
recognize that it has happened,</i>

00:21:42.334 --> 00:21:45.237
<i> it's important that we
 understand the severity
 of this conflict</i>

00:21:45.237 --> 00:21:48.439
<i> and also the hatred
 that was for a period</i>

00:21:48.439 --> 00:21:50.241
<i> present in this area.</i>

00:21:50.241 --> 00:21:52.310
<i> This is a young man
 being lynched on the streets</i>

00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:54.513
<i> he's a porter,
 a Christian porter</i>

00:21:54.513 --> 00:21:56.514
<i> who's bringing supplies
 into a Muslim enclave</i>

00:21:56.514 --> 00:21:58.282
<i> so that they could eat.</i>

00:21:58.282 --> 00:22:00.818
<i> They would have flour
 to cook with</i>

00:22:00.818 --> 00:22:02.821
<i>and sugar to use for their tea.</i>

00:22:02.821 --> 00:22:05.490
<i> And as he came in and
 he was caught by the</i>

00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:07.591
<i> Muslim population
 he was serving,</i>

00:22:07.591 --> 00:22:10.728
<i> and attacked and then beaten</i>

00:22:10.728 --> 00:22:12.129
<i> and then chased
 through the streets</i>

00:22:12.129 --> 00:22:14.732
<i> with machetes and
 with bows and arrows.</i>

00:22:14.732 --> 00:22:16.935
<i> Thankfully he escaped.</i>

00:22:16.935 --> 00:22:19.671
<i> Many, many more didn't.</i>

00:22:19.671 --> 00:22:23.641
<i> This young man actually is
 Muslim and is disabled</i>

00:22:23.641 --> 00:22:25.710
<i> and couldn't communicate
 that he was Muslim</i>

00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:27.345
<i> and so was beaten up</i>

00:22:27.345 --> 00:22:31.682
<i> to the point of almost death
 by his fellow Muslims.</i>

00:22:31.682 --> 00:22:35.353
<i> These are the reality of what
 happened day after day</i>

00:22:35.353 --> 00:22:37.956
<i> after day for six weeks
 in Bangui.</i>

00:22:37.956 --> 00:22:40.726
<i> I think I witnessed
 maybe 10 to 15 people</i>

00:22:40.726 --> 00:22:44.462
<i> being killed in front
 of my camera every day.</i>

00:22:44.462 --> 00:22:46.964
<i> The peacekeepers tried their
 best to keep the peace but...</i>

00:22:46.964 --> 00:22:48.232
<i>simply they couldn't control it,</i>

00:22:48.232 --> 00:22:49.200
<i>there weren't enough of them and</i>

00:22:49.333 --> 00:22:52.637
<i> the capital Bangui
 was completely out of control.</i>

00:22:52.637 --> 00:22:55.140
<i> The anti-balaka
 throughout the country,</i>

00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:57.408
<i> took control of whatever
 they could take control of</i>

00:22:57.408 --> 00:22:59.277
<i> and preyed on the
 remaining Muslims.</i>

00:22:59.277 --> 00:23:00.645
<i> They were trapped
 in these enclaves</i>

00:23:00.645 --> 00:23:02.914
<i> and they were picking
 them off one by one.</i>

00:23:03.914 --> 00:23:06.418
And so what did that lead to?

00:23:06.418 --> 00:23:08.753
Some people called
it ethnic cleansing.

00:23:08.753 --> 00:23:10.922
Amnesty international have
called it ethnic cleansing.

00:23:10.922 --> 00:23:12.891
What is ethnic cleansing?

00:23:12.891 --> 00:23:14.626
Ethnic cleansing is
where a group,

00:23:14.626 --> 00:23:17.428
a population are targeted,
very specific

00:23:17.428 --> 00:23:19.730
ethnic group are targeted by

00:23:19.730 --> 00:23:21.966
an organized group

00:23:21.966 --> 00:23:24.301
and it was very difficult
to say at the beginning whether

00:23:24.301 --> 00:23:25.736
the anti-balaka were organized?

00:23:25.736 --> 00:23:26.871
Whether they were coordinated?

00:23:26.871 --> 00:23:29.474
Whether there was
a chain of command?

00:23:29.474 --> 00:23:30.475
It's since been proved

00:23:30.709 --> 00:23:32.543
and they have admitted that
there is the chain of command

00:23:32.543 --> 00:23:34.045
within the anti-balaka.

00:23:34.045 --> 00:23:36.981
And so, maybe we can
call it ethnic cleansing.

00:23:36.981 --> 00:23:38.849
But really it's irrelevant
what we call it.

00:23:38.849 --> 00:23:41.953
Because the effect,
it was really the same.

00:23:41.953 --> 00:23:46.223
<i> This is a Chad Special Forces
 soldier coming into Bangui</i>

00:23:46.223 --> 00:23:48.526
<i> to escort tens of
 thousands of people</i>

00:23:48.526 --> 00:23:50.996
<i> out of the region on
 these trucks.</i>

00:23:50.996 --> 00:23:53.665
<i> I stood there for maybe
 45 minutes</i>

00:23:53.665 --> 00:23:56.467
<i> as truck after truck
 after truck loaded up</i>

00:23:56.467 --> 00:23:58.703
<i> to the extent that
 this one is loaded up,</i>

00:23:58.703 --> 00:24:01.273
<i> left Bangui with
 Muslims on board.</i>

00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:04.842
<i> This is a young
 father with a new born</i>

00:24:04.842 --> 00:24:08.780
<i> waiting for the trucks
 to leave the center of Bangui.</i>

00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:11.048
Many of these trucks
were targeted by anti-balaka

00:24:11.048 --> 00:24:13.952
on the road and grenades
were thrown into these trucks

00:24:13.952 --> 00:24:16.254
from the villages that
they were passing through.

00:24:16.254 --> 00:24:18.323
So not everybody
made it through.

00:24:18.323 --> 00:24:21.826
And the trip was hours,
days to...

00:24:21.826 --> 00:24:23.327
you know,
they were running the gauntlets

00:24:23.327 --> 00:24:24.495
of these anti-balaka groups

00:24:24.495 --> 00:24:26.832
for days to get
to Cameroon and Chad.

00:24:26.832 --> 00:24:29.634
<i> I recently visited most of the
 Peul population,</i>

00:24:29.634 --> 00:24:30.802
<i> hundreds of thousands
 of the people</i>

00:24:30.802 --> 00:24:32.437
<i> that are seeking
 refuge in Cameroon.</i>

00:24:32.437 --> 00:24:34.605
<i> For the first time in
 18 months they feel safe.</i>

00:24:34.605 --> 00:24:36.774
<i>For the first time in 18 months
 they have enough food.</i>

00:24:36.774 --> 00:24:38.242
<i> For the first time
 in a very long time</i>

00:24:38.242 --> 00:24:40.111
<i> they have shelter
 over their heads.</i>

00:24:40.111 --> 00:24:42.012
<i> Their children go to school</i>

00:24:42.012 --> 00:24:44.182
<i> and so it was very
 uplifting after such,</i>

00:24:44.182 --> 00:24:45.883
after many,
many months of hatred,

00:24:45.883 --> 00:24:48.586
many, many months of pain,
many, many months of killing.

00:24:48.586 --> 00:24:50.187
I was starting to see

00:24:50.187 --> 00:24:53.358
the population that I'd known
10 years ago in Bangui.

00:24:53.358 --> 00:24:56.394
I saw the people that were
making the butterflies.

00:24:56.394 --> 00:24:57.695
I saw the laughter again.

00:24:57.695 --> 00:25:00.098
I saw the children
playing football again.

00:25:01.232 --> 00:25:04.469
<i> All guarded by
 now the Cameroon military</i>

00:25:04.469 --> 00:25:07.705
<i> so that the anti-balaka
 don't come across and start</i>

00:25:07.705 --> 00:25:09.540
<i>attacking the local population.</i>

00:25:10.508 --> 00:25:13.411
<i> The children, some of them go
 to school for the first time.</i>

00:25:14.845 --> 00:25:16.414
<i> And they now live as
 they lived in</i>

00:25:16.414 --> 00:25:19.451
<i> Central African Republic
 in these camps in CAR.</i>

00:25:19.451 --> 00:25:20.684
And the UNHCR,

00:25:20.684 --> 00:25:22.320
United Nations High Commissions
for Refugees

00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:24.855
is doing actually a really
interesting... a really good job

00:25:24.855 --> 00:25:27.358
of integrating the
refugee population

00:25:27.358 --> 00:25:31.295
with the local
Cameroonian population

00:25:31.295 --> 00:25:34.732
so that... there is very little
animosity between the two.

00:25:34.732 --> 00:25:38.236
So they go into
a town and they bore

00:25:38.236 --> 00:25:41.439
10 or 15 wells,
they create 10 or 15 wells

00:25:41.439 --> 00:25:42.841
for the whole population,

00:25:42.841 --> 00:25:44.108
not just for the
refugee population

00:25:44.108 --> 00:25:45.543
but for the whole population.

00:25:45.543 --> 00:25:46.911
They build schools
for the whole population,

00:25:46.911 --> 00:25:48.379
not just for the
refugee population.

00:25:48.379 --> 00:25:50.781
So in a way they are
learning their lessons,

00:25:50.781 --> 00:25:52.583
they're becoming
better in what they do

00:25:52.583 --> 00:25:53.918
and this is a great example.

00:25:53.918 --> 00:25:56.154
We were very encouraged by
what we saw there.

00:25:56.888 --> 00:25:58.522
<i> There is a lot
 of talk about return,</i>

00:25:58.522 --> 00:26:00.124
<i> like when can these
 people return.</i>

00:26:00.124 --> 00:26:02.159
<i>But I asked all of these people</i>

00:26:02.193 --> 00:26:03.695
<i> when did they want to return,</i>

00:26:03.695 --> 00:26:06.464
<i> if they wanted to return and
 no one wanted to return.</i>

00:26:06.464 --> 00:26:08.432
<i> No one needed to return.</i>

00:26:08.432 --> 00:26:11.770
<i>And this is a really interesting
 concept for refugees,</i>

00:26:11.770 --> 00:26:13.939
<i> should we force them,
 at some point to return?</i>

00:26:13.939 --> 00:26:16.374
<i> Should we be really
 be working for that end?</i>

00:26:16.374 --> 00:26:17.609
<i> And this is a really
 interesting question</i>

00:26:17.609 --> 00:26:20.144
<i> that we still don't
 know the answer to.</i>

00:26:20.144 --> 00:26:22.413
<i> Thank you very much
 indeed for listening</i>

00:26:22.413 --> 00:26:24.249
( applause )

00:26:24.249 --> 00:26:27.519
