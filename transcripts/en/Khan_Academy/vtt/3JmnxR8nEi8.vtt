00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.390
In this video, I'm going
to multiply 87 times 63.

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:07.890
But I'm not going to do it
just by using some process,

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.550
just showing you some steps.

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:12.450
Instead, we're just going to
use the distributive property

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.940
to actually try to
calculate this thing.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.530
So first, what I'm going
to do-- let me rewrite 87.

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:21.440
So this is the same thing as 87.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.040
But instead of
writing 63 like that,

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:29.457
I'm going to write
63 as 60 plus 3.

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.660
Now, what is this
going to be equal to?

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.720
Well, 87 times 60
plus 3, that's going

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.380
to be the same thing
as-- and let me actually

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:42.360
copy and paste this.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:54.670
So this is going to be the
same thing as 87 times 60

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.850
plus 87 times 3.

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:08.310
You could say that we've
just distributed the 87.

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.610
We're multiplying
87 times 60 plus 3.

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:16.520
That's 87 times 60
plus 87 times 3.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.490
I could put parentheses here to
make it a little bit clearer.

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.240
Well, fair enough.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.580
But then how do you
calculate what this is?

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.070
Well, now we can
rewrite 87 as 80 plus 7.

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.530
So let's rewrite that.

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:30.722
So this is the same thing.

00:01:30.722 --> 00:01:32.180
Actually, let me
write it this way.

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:33.420
I can swap them around.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.260
So this is the same
thing as 60 times 87.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:43.400
But I'll write that
as 60 times 80 plus 7.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.890
We could do it like this.

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:58.309
80 plus 7 plus 3 times
80 plus 7, or 3 times 87.

00:01:58.309 --> 00:01:59.850
Let me just copy
and paste that, so I

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.349
don't have to keep
switching colors.

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:04.190
Plus 3 times 80 plus 7.

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.070
So copy and then
let me paste it.

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.800
And then you have
it just like that.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.980
So all I did, just to
be clear-- all of what

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.560
you see right over here,
87 times 60, well, that's

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.950
the same thing as
60 times 87, which

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.440
is the same thing as
60 times 80 plus 7.

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.560
All that you see
here, 87 times 3,

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.090
that's the same thing
as 3 times 87, which

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.400
is the same thing as
3 times 80 plus 7.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.180
That's just that over here.

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.100
But look, we can
distribute again.

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.630
We can distribute the
60 times 80 plus 7.

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.900
So this is going to be 60-- I'm
going to do that same color.

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.320
Color changing is hard.

00:02:43.320 --> 00:03:02.410
This is 60 times 80 plus
60 times 7 plus 3 times

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:21.235
80 plus 3 times 7
right over here.

00:03:21.235 --> 00:03:23.290
So notice what we
really did is we

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.720
thought about what each
of these digits represent.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.110
8 represents 80.

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:28.440
7 represents 7.

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.579
6 represents 60, because
it's in the tens place.

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:32.120
The 8 was in the
tens place, as well.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.290
This 3 is in the ones
place, so it's just 3.

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.170
And we just multiplied
them all together.

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.380
We multiplied the
80 times the 60.

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.980
We multiplied the
80 times the 3.

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.030
We multiplied the 7 times
the 60 right over here.

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.120
We multiplied the 7 times the 3.

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.170
And then we add them
all up together.

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.500
And this will actually
give us our product.

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.880
So for example, this right
over here, 6 times 8 is 48.

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.340
But this isn't six 8's.

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:59.970
This is 60 80's.

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.285
So this is going to be 4,800.

00:04:02.285 --> 00:04:03.900
We've got two 0's
right over here,

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.810
so 48 followed by the two 0's.

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:12.200
This right over here,
60 times 7, is 420.

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.790
6 times 7 is 42.

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.050
But it's going to be 10 times
as much, because this is a 60.

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:19.940
And then 3 times 80--
well, same logic.

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:21.170
3 times 8 is 24.

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:23.860
So this is going to be 240.

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.062
And then, finally,
3 times 7 is 21.

00:04:27.062 --> 00:04:29.520
And then to get the product,
we can add these two together.

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:30.300
And you might be
saying, hey, Sal,

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:31.520
I know faster ways
of doing this.

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:32.978
But the whole reason
I'm doing this

00:04:32.978 --> 00:04:35.440
is to show you that that fast
way you knew how to do it,

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.610
it's not some magical formula
or some magical process you're

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:40.180
doing.

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.400
It just comes out of really
the distributive property

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.409
and, hopefully, a little
bit of common sense.

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:45.950
So what is this
going to be equal to?

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:47.241
Well, we could add them all up.

00:04:47.241 --> 00:04:53.950
4,800 plus 420 plus 240 plus 21.

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:55.440
Well, you're going
to get a 1 here.

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:56.130
Let's see.

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:59.410
20 plus 40 plus 20 is 80.

00:04:59.410 --> 00:04:59.910
Let's see.

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:10.420
800 plus 400 is 1,200
plus 200 more is 1,400.

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:12.740
And so you get 5,481.

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.730
It's equal to 5,481.

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:19.000
And you might say, gee,
this was a bit of a pain

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.530
to have to do the distributive
property over and over again.

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:24.010
Is there a simpler way
to maybe visualize this?

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:24.920
And there is.

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:26.860
You could actually
write this as a grid.

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.430
So we could say we're
multiplying 87 times 63.

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:31.800
We could write it like this.

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:44.760
We could say it's 80
plus 7 times 60 plus 3.

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:46.680
And then you can set
up a grid like this.

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.840
So let me set up
a little box here.

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.730
It's 2 digits by 2 digits.

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:55.170
So it's going to be a 2 by 2
grid, 2 rows and 2 columns.

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:57.340
And then you just
have to calculate.

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:58.636
Well, what's 60 times 80?

00:05:58.636 --> 00:06:00.010
Well, we already
calculated that.

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:02.510
That's 4,800.

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:04.760
What is 60 times 7?

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:08.650
Well, that's going to be 420.

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:10.520
What is 3 times 80?

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:11.930
We already calculated that.

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:14.245
That is 240.

00:06:14.245 --> 00:06:17.210
And I want to do that
same color-- 240.

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:19.881
And finally, what is 3 times 7?

00:06:19.881 --> 00:06:20.810
21.

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:22.310
You add them all together.

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:25.600
You get 5,481.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:28.870
And I encourage you to now just
do this same multiplication

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:31.850
problem, the same
87 times 63, the way

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:34.600
that you might have
traditionally learned it.

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:37.300
And look at the different steps
and why they are making sense

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:39.050
and why, at the end
of the day, you really

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:41.534
are doing the same thing that
we just did in this video.

00:06:41.534 --> 00:06:43.200
You're just doing it
in a different way.

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:45.080
And the whole point of
this whole exercise,

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:49.510
this whole video, is so
you're not just blindly

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:52.550
doing some type of steps to
find the product of two numbers.

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:55.150
But you can actually
understand why those steps work

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:58.200
and how those numbers
relate to each other.
