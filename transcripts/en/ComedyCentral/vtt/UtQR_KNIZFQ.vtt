00:00:01.101 --> 00:00:02.302
We've heard
a lot of different facts

00:00:02.302 --> 00:00:03.837
about how Puerto Rico is faring

00:00:03.837 --> 00:00:05.239
in the wake of Hurricane Maria.

00:00:05.239 --> 00:00:07.674
And while President Trump
says Puerto Rico is doing great,

00:00:07.674 --> 00:00:10.143
I only believe what I can see
with my own eyes

00:00:10.143 --> 00:00:11.411
and touch with my own

00:00:11.411 --> 00:00:14.114
no-problem-down-there-sized
hands.

00:00:14.114 --> 00:00:15.849
That's why I flew down
to Puerto Rico

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:18.852
to find out the truth about
Trump's recovery efforts myself.

00:00:18.852 --> 00:00:20.053
Take a look.

00:00:20.053 --> 00:00:21.455
I've watched Puerto Rico

00:00:21.455 --> 00:00:24.391
face an unprecedented amount
of damage after Hurricane Maria.

00:00:24.391 --> 00:00:26.493
But I was impressed
by President Trump

00:00:26.493 --> 00:00:28.662
when he swung in,
paper towels in hand,

00:00:28.662 --> 00:00:30.364
and he cleaned up that mess

00:00:30.364 --> 00:00:32.633
to his own rave reviews.

00:00:32.633 --> 00:00:34.301
We have done an incredible job.

00:00:34.301 --> 00:00:36.703
What is your death count
as of this moment, 17?

00:00:36.703 --> 00:00:38.839
-16 certified.
-16 people.

00:00:38.839 --> 00:00:40.674
I give ourselves a ten.

00:00:40.674 --> 00:00:42.276
A ten. A ten.

00:00:42.276 --> 00:00:44.544
 So I headed down
 to gather thank yous

00:00:44.544 --> 00:00:47.080
 and see Donald Trump's
 perfect score firsthand.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.615
Puerto Rico!

00:00:48.615 --> 00:00:50.017
Ten out of ten?

00:00:50.017 --> 00:00:51.685
Ten out of ten.

00:00:51.685 --> 00:00:53.353
Ten.

00:00:53.353 --> 00:00:56.023
The cables are more of a six.

00:00:56.023 --> 00:00:58.558
Probably, like, a three.

00:00:58.558 --> 00:01:00.360
Jesus.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.296
I don't even know what that is.
That's...

00:01:02.296 --> 00:01:03.830
that's probably, like, a two.

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:05.832
 Okay, so if I'm keeping score,

00:01:05.832 --> 00:01:09.636
 we're probably averaging out
 to about a 6.5.

00:01:09.636 --> 00:01:12.372
 But if you round up,
 that's a ten, baby.

00:01:12.372 --> 00:01:14.107
 And in the neighborhoods
 of San Juan,

00:01:14.107 --> 00:01:16.043
 people are even back to work,

00:01:16.043 --> 00:01:17.711
 specifically kids.

00:01:17.711 --> 00:01:20.247
These kids organized
getting generators

00:01:20.247 --> 00:01:23.183
for this community center so it
has power to teach other kids.

00:01:23.183 --> 00:01:26.386
Did it all by themselves.
Didn't need adults' help.

00:01:26.386 --> 00:01:29.856
Probably should offer my help.
I should...

00:01:29.856 --> 00:01:31.391
They got it now anyway.

00:01:31.391 --> 00:01:33.593
 These kids were working hard
 but not in school,

00:01:33.593 --> 00:01:36.663
 because, technically, only 40%
 of the schools are open

00:01:36.663 --> 00:01:38.999
 and 60% of people
 have no power.

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:41.301
 Half a million people
 are without clean water.

00:01:41.301 --> 00:01:45.772
 But, still, I could tell
 this was a good news story.

00:01:45.772 --> 00:01:48.108
 Right,
 DHS Secretary Elaine Duke?

00:01:48.108 --> 00:01:51.578
I know it-it is really
a good news story

00:01:51.578 --> 00:01:54.381
in terms of our ability
to-to reach people

00:01:54.381 --> 00:01:57.184
and the limited number of deaths
that have taken place.

00:01:57.184 --> 00:01:59.853
 "Limited number"-- that makes
 it almost sound special.

00:01:59.853 --> 00:02:02.189
 But some people had
 their own narrative.

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.458
Damn it,
this is not a good news story.

00:02:04.458 --> 00:02:07.127
 Unbelievable. Mayor Cruz
 should be saying thank you,

00:02:07.127 --> 00:02:08.862
 but, instead,
 she's on the warpath.

00:02:08.862 --> 00:02:10.464
I want to confront Mayor Cruz
to talk to her

00:02:10.464 --> 00:02:11.865
about some of the language
she's using

00:02:11.865 --> 00:02:14.368
to communicate with
our president, Donald Trump.

00:02:14.368 --> 00:02:18.372
This is a ten out of 100,
which is still a failing grade.

00:02:18.372 --> 00:02:20.774
There's no power,
no communications,

00:02:20.774 --> 00:02:23.243
no phones, and no electricity.

00:02:23.243 --> 00:02:24.578
Is that a ten out of a ten?

00:02:24.578 --> 00:02:27.848
It's tough for America
to get supplies here.

00:02:27.848 --> 00:02:29.916
You can't drive a truck here. I
don't know if you realize that.

00:02:29.916 --> 00:02:32.486
That's right, 'cause we are
an island surrounded by water.

00:02:32.486 --> 00:02:35.489
-Lots and lots of water. Ocean
water, right? -Exactly. Exactly.

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.357
We didn't know that
until this happened.

00:02:37.357 --> 00:02:39.159
Well, that's what I'm saying.
It's-it's difficult.

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:40.761
Don't you think you need
to give us a little leeway?

00:02:40.761 --> 00:02:42.763
The most powerful country
in the world

00:02:42.763 --> 00:02:45.032
can't get their logistics
together?

00:02:45.032 --> 00:02:46.633
-I don't think so.
-I saw pictures.

00:02:46.633 --> 00:02:48.769
You're out having fun swimming,
and he's out there making deals

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:49.970
on a golf course.

00:02:52.506 --> 00:02:54.841
When you're playing golf
rather than helping people,

00:02:54.841 --> 00:02:58.578
it may give you a distorted way
of looking at things.

00:02:58.578 --> 00:03:01.314
 Yes, Cruz is one
 of those local Never Trumpers

00:03:01.314 --> 00:03:03.383
 who's continually pushing
 the false narrative

00:03:03.383 --> 00:03:06.186
 that Texas or Florida
 got more recovery money

00:03:06.186 --> 00:03:07.854
 than Puerto Rico.

00:03:07.854 --> 00:03:10.390
 That's actually a lot more.

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.325
Now, Donald Trump,
when he came here...

00:03:12.325 --> 00:03:14.861
Oh, my God,
that man is a disaster.

00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:18.865
What? The man protects people
after a disaster.

00:03:18.865 --> 00:03:21.535
-Not my president.
-Well-well, he sure is.

00:03:21.535 --> 00:03:22.869
You voted for him.

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:26.606
I, as a Puerto Rican,
was not permitted to vote.

00:03:26.606 --> 00:03:28.542
 What is she even talking about?
 Back up.

00:03:28.542 --> 00:03:31.278
 What is a Puerto Rico?

00:03:31.278 --> 00:03:33.146
Treat me like a dumb American

00:03:33.146 --> 00:03:35.549
who knows nothing
about Puerto Rico.

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:38.351
Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory,
precarious territory,

00:03:38.351 --> 00:03:41.021
um, basically abandoned,
but, yeah, this is America.

00:03:41.021 --> 00:03:42.089
It's like a Cuba?

00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:44.024
Uh, definitely no.

00:03:44.024 --> 00:03:45.759
-It's not a Cuba.
-It's not a Cuba.

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:47.427
-It's like a Guam?
-Eh, probably,

00:03:47.427 --> 00:03:49.362
-in the sense that we've been
neglected -A Florida Key?

00:03:49.362 --> 00:03:50.831
by the U.S. government, but yes.

00:03:50.831 --> 00:03:52.966
As long as we live
on the island,

00:03:52.966 --> 00:03:55.836
we are not entitled to vote
for the president

00:03:55.836 --> 00:04:00.207
or our duly elected
representatives in Congress.

00:04:00.207 --> 00:04:02.542
 Apparently, Puerto Rico
 is part of the U.S.

00:04:02.542 --> 00:04:06.213
 Its people are citizens,
 but they have no voting rights.

00:04:06.213 --> 00:04:09.683
 What's worse, Puerto Rico is
 suffering under crippling debt,

00:04:09.683 --> 00:04:12.352
 and they are legally forbidden
 to declare bankruptcy,

00:04:12.352 --> 00:04:14.221
 unlike cities
 in the mainland U.S.,

00:04:14.221 --> 00:04:16.223
 where that happens
 all the time.

00:04:16.223 --> 00:04:18.358
 On top of that, there's this.

00:04:18.358 --> 00:04:22.162
The thing that Donald Trump
can do is declare the law,

00:04:22.162 --> 00:04:23.897
the Jones Act, null.

00:04:23.897 --> 00:04:25.398
Just scrap it.

00:04:25.398 --> 00:04:27.667
 The Jones Act is an obscure law
 that says

00:04:27.667 --> 00:04:30.003
 all goods transported
 between American ports

00:04:30.003 --> 00:04:31.805
 must be carried
 by American ships,

00:04:31.805 --> 00:04:34.407
 which means foreign ships
 coming to Puerto Rico

00:04:34.407 --> 00:04:37.477
 either pay big tariffs
 or reroute to mainland U.S.,

00:04:37.477 --> 00:04:39.880
 where they transfer the cargo
 to a U.S. ship.

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.015
 And all those dollar signs
 are paid for by the people

00:04:42.015 --> 00:04:44.551
 of Puerto Rico, making it
 a fortune to rebuild.

00:04:44.551 --> 00:04:47.888
I don't want more--
I just want equal.

00:04:47.888 --> 00:04:49.689
All this talk of history,

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:51.958
feels like a lot of you guys
are just looking behind you.

00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:54.694
From where I'm sitting,
it's beautiful.

00:04:54.694 --> 00:04:56.029
Ten out of ten.

00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:58.331
GONZALEZ:
Maybe. I don't know.

00:04:58.331 --> 00:05:01.735
KLEPPER: Hmm. Okay, maybe
 there was more to this recovery

00:05:01.735 --> 00:05:03.303
 than I initially thought.

00:05:03.303 --> 00:05:05.372
 I think I'm starting
 to put it together. When

00:05:05.372 --> 00:05:06.907
Donald Trump said it was a ten,

00:05:06.907 --> 00:05:08.241
he wasn't talking
about his response.

00:05:08.241 --> 00:05:10.343
He was talking
about the response he inspired.

00:05:10.343 --> 00:05:12.279
See, he's always thinking
a couple of steps ahead.

00:05:12.279 --> 00:05:14.247
So many steps,
often, he's behind.

00:05:14.247 --> 00:05:16.616
So that I like to call
"trickle down responsibility."

00:05:16.616 --> 00:05:19.586
 People in the community, well,
 then they're the ones

00:05:19.586 --> 00:05:21.054
 who step up,
 they come together,

00:05:21.054 --> 00:05:22.789
 and they fix the problems,
 they move forward as a people,

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:25.158
and thus become
that much more united.

00:05:25.158 --> 00:05:27.794
And we all know Donald Trump--
he's a uniter.

00:05:27.794 --> 00:05:29.596
You see it here.

00:05:30.931 --> 00:05:32.566
 Getting lost

00:05:32.566 --> 00:05:34.234
 wandering back to my hotel

00:05:34.234 --> 00:05:37.437
 because there was no GPS,
 Wi-Fi or streetlights,

00:05:37.437 --> 00:05:39.039
 I came across this--

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:42.876
 a generator-powered bar
 of people finding community.

00:05:42.876 --> 00:05:45.111
(upbeat music playing)

00:05:45.111 --> 00:05:48.014
 I saw this over and over
 in my time on the island--

00:05:48.014 --> 00:05:49.583
 families filling carts
 with supplies

00:05:49.583 --> 00:05:50.750
 to deliver
 to hurting neighborhoods.

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:52.219
WOMAN:
We're survivors,

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:54.921
but right now,
we still need a lot of help.

00:05:54.921 --> 00:05:56.289
KLEPPER: People adopting
 long-forgotten pets.

00:05:56.289 --> 00:05:57.824
WOMAN 2:
 We need adoptions,

00:05:57.824 --> 00:06:00.627
and we need to get planes
to ship these dogs out.

00:06:00.627 --> 00:06:03.730
KLEPPER: Soup kitchens popping
 up in closed restaurants

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:05.999
 to help hungry people
 in neighboring towns.

00:06:05.999 --> 00:06:08.201
It's, like, you don't sit down
and wait to be fed.

00:06:08.201 --> 00:06:10.036
You work for it.
You work hard.

00:06:10.036 --> 00:06:11.271
There's a famous quote.

00:06:11.271 --> 00:06:12.505
I don't know who said it.
But it's like,

00:06:12.505 --> 00:06:15.075
"Give a man a fish,
and he will eat one day.

00:06:15.075 --> 00:06:18.979
Help teach him how to fish,
and he will eat forever."

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:21.047
That was Reagan.
Smart guy.

00:06:21.047 --> 00:06:24.484
 The people, the politicians,
 the cooks, the animal rescuers,

00:06:24.484 --> 00:06:27.954
 the kids, that guy--
 I think I met him earlier--

00:06:27.954 --> 00:06:32.459
 they are the ten out of ten
 that Trump was talking about.

00:06:32.459 --> 00:06:35.428
 It seems like a lot of people
 doing small things was making

00:06:35.428 --> 00:06:37.063
 a big difference.

00:06:37.063 --> 00:06:39.165
 It made me think a lot
 about myself.

00:06:39.165 --> 00:06:41.468
 I'm wondering if I could do
 something, like,

00:06:41.468 --> 00:06:44.104
 the bare minimum.

00:06:44.104 --> 00:06:46.106
Great reporting, Jordan. Great.

00:06:46.106 --> 00:06:48.975
(cheers and applause)

00:06:48.975 --> 00:06:52.145
Hey there. Hey,
Mr. Commander-in-Chief,

00:06:52.145 --> 00:06:53.913
this message is for you.

00:06:53.913 --> 00:06:56.583
Your heroic near-efforts
have inspired so many people

00:06:56.583 --> 00:07:00.120
in Puerto Rico to step up
and take actions for themselves.

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:02.322
And for that,
you deserve a big thank you.

00:07:02.322 --> 00:07:03.957
So we brought you back a gift

00:07:03.957 --> 00:07:05.892
from the island
to show our gratitude.

00:07:05.892 --> 00:07:07.394
-This is Izzy...
-AUDIENCE MEMBERS: Aw.

00:07:07.394 --> 00:07:09.863
...one of the many abandoned
animals we saw down there.

00:07:09.863 --> 00:07:13.833
-(applause and cheering) -Izzy's
such a good girl, or boy.

00:07:13.833 --> 00:07:16.636
I don't know. I wasn't allowed
to have pets when I was a kid.

00:07:16.636 --> 00:07:21.541
And Izzy is ready to be the
official first dog of America.

00:07:21.541 --> 00:07:24.611
You see, you're the first
president in 150 years

00:07:24.611 --> 00:07:27.681
to not have a pet
at The White House.

00:07:27.681 --> 00:07:31.551
Now, some lefties
are using this against you,

00:07:31.551 --> 00:07:33.987
saying it's evidence of your
lack of kindness and empathy,

00:07:33.987 --> 00:07:36.756
and that you'd never be able
to take care of something

00:07:36.756 --> 00:07:38.992
-that doesn't immediately
benefit you. -(laughter)

00:07:38.992 --> 00:07:42.128
By adopting Izzy,
you can prove them all wrong.

00:07:42.128 --> 00:07:43.830
And who knows?

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:46.099
A good photo op
with your new furry friend

00:07:46.099 --> 00:07:47.634
could get
your approval rating back

00:07:47.634 --> 00:07:50.103
-in the low forties
where it belongs. -(laughter)

00:07:50.103 --> 00:07:52.105
-Yeah!
-(applause and cheering)

00:07:52.105 --> 00:07:55.775
And Izzy... Izzy is so excited
to come live with you.

00:07:55.775 --> 00:07:58.244
Aren't you, girl?
Or boy?

00:07:58.244 --> 00:08:00.246
She's such a good girl or boy.

00:08:00.246 --> 00:08:02.082
So, come pick Izzy up.

00:08:02.082 --> 00:08:04.017
Our only request is that,
when you do,

00:08:04.017 --> 00:08:06.019
you'll tell us about your plans
for the island.

00:08:06.019 --> 00:08:08.955
We'll take care of, uh, her
or him here at The Opposition

00:08:08.955 --> 00:08:10.490
until you're able to stop by.

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:11.891
But it's not just Trump.

00:08:11.891 --> 00:08:14.294
Everyone can take a little step
to help Puerto Rico recover.

00:08:14.294 --> 00:08:16.096
Here are a few
of the many sources

00:08:16.096 --> 00:08:17.997
where you can get
more information on how

00:08:17.997 --> 00:08:19.899
to support ongoing
relief efforts in Puerto Rico.

00:08:19.899 --> 00:08:21.835
 -The Opposition will return.
-(cheers and applause)
