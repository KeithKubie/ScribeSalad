00:00:07.072 --> 00:00:08.041
Coming from where I come from,

00:00:08.074 --> 00:00:09.208 size:81% position:41%
you know,
you loan a guy some money,

00:00:09.241 --> 00:00:11.711 size:78% position:39%
he doesn't give you
your money, you got to --

00:00:11.744 --> 00:00:13.780 align:start position:0%
you have to seek retribution
other types of ways,

00:00:13.813 --> 00:00:15.581 size:81% position:41%
so I feel like they should
just go out there

00:00:15.614 --> 00:00:17.950 size:69% position:34%
and line up the fight,
and see what it do.

00:00:17.983 --> 00:00:19.318 size:78% position:39%
You know what I'm saying?
Just line up the fight.

00:00:19.351 --> 00:00:20.686 size:72% position:36%
It don't even matter --
size don't matter.

00:00:20.719 --> 00:00:23.790 size:78% position:39% line:83%
Just line it up,
and they squabble it out.

00:00:20.719 --> 00:00:23.790 align:start size:28% position:72%
Maybe.

00:00:23.823 --> 00:00:28.494 size:69% position:34%
Let's line up a fight,
you videotape it,
we put it on Youtube,

00:00:28.527 --> 00:00:29.729 size:84% position:42%
we charge 'em a percentage,

00:00:29.762 --> 00:00:32.398 size:72% position:36%
and he can make
his $900 back that way.

00:00:32.431 --> 00:00:35.301 align:end position:100%
Slink, you know what you are?
You're an idea man.

00:00:35.334 --> 00:00:36.836 align:start size:81% position:19%
What do you think of this?

00:00:36.869 --> 00:00:38.805 size:81% position:59%
I don't know if, as judge,
I can do this,

00:00:38.838 --> 00:00:41.207 align:end position:100%
but maybe I can look it up
in one of these books.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.675 align:start size:88% position:13%
Yeah. Books.

00:00:42.708 --> 00:00:45.278 size:72% position:64%
What if I went in there
and told them

00:00:45.311 --> 00:00:48.081 size:78% position:61%
that, you know,
just for old time's sake,

00:00:48.114 --> 00:00:50.450 size:66% position:67%
they should get drunk
one more time?

00:00:50.483 --> 00:00:54.921 size:72% position:64%
And then, when
the defendant is drunk,

00:00:54.954 --> 00:00:57.423 align:end position:100%
the plaintiff can say,
"Hey, can you loan me $900?"

00:00:57.456 --> 00:01:00.293 align:end position:100%
'Cause I bet you he'd give him
the $900 while he's drunk.

00:01:00.326 --> 00:01:01.494 align:start size:75% position:25%
Hmm!

00:01:01.527 --> 00:01:04.697 align:start position:0%
Or maybe the defendant
can ask for the $900 again,

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.867
and get it from the plaintiff,
and pay him back the first $900.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:08.968 align:start size:59% position:41%
If he's too drunk.

00:01:09.001 --> 00:01:10.236 size:63% position:31%
If he's too drunk.
Exactly.

00:01:10.269 --> 00:01:11.671 size:72% position:36%
So it's a win
for both of those guys.

00:01:11.704 --> 00:01:14.040
That big guy seems
like he can handle his booze.

00:01:14.073 --> 00:01:16.309 align:start size:94% position:6%
Nah, that guy --

00:01:16.342 --> 00:01:18.010 size:63% position:31%
that guy
soft as cotton, bro.

00:01:18.043 --> 00:01:19.579 align:start size:44% position:56% line:92%
You think?

00:01:18.043 --> 00:01:19.579 align:start size:84% position:16%
I know it.

00:01:19.612 --> 00:01:22.215 size:66% position:33%
I think he drinks
a nice, warm --

00:01:22.248 --> 00:01:24.784
I think he drinks
a nice cold glass of Chablis,

00:01:24.817 --> 00:01:26.119 align:start size:97% position:3%
and he shit-faced.

00:01:26.152 --> 00:01:27.787 size:78% position:39%
That's why the little guy
hangs out with him.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.689
You can't really just measure

00:01:29.722 --> 00:01:31.390 size:63% position:31%
a person's size
like that, you know?

00:01:31.423 --> 00:01:32.992 align:start size:31% position:69% line:85%
Right.

00:01:31.423 --> 00:01:32.992 size:63% position:31%
I'm not much
of a drinker myself.

00:01:33.025 --> 00:01:35.461 align:start position:0%
I have a couple of 'em,
and next thing I know,

00:01:35.494 --> 00:01:39.432 size:84% position:42%
I got some buxom,
180-pound blonde, you know,

00:01:39.465 --> 00:01:40.933 align:start position:0%
crawling up on my body
taking advantage of me.

00:01:40.966 --> 00:01:43.169 align:start size:78% position:22% line:78%
Oh, that sounds terrible!

00:01:40.966 --> 00:01:43.169 align:start size:91% position:9%
It's horrible.
It's horrible.

00:01:43.202 --> 00:01:45.438 size:88% position:44%
One of those big
Eastern-European thick ones,

00:01:45.471 --> 00:01:46.873 size:63% position:31%
you know what
I'm talking about?

00:01:46.906 --> 00:01:48.441 align:start size:97% position:3%
They always get me.

"I want to climb you
like a tree, Slinky."

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.612 size:63% position:31%

Let me see that.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.251 size:69% position:66%
I love that people
might call you Slinky.

00:01:58.284 --> 00:01:59.819 size:69% position:34%
Kinky Slinky
with the stinky pinky.

00:01:59.852 --> 00:02:01.354 size:72% position:36%
but that was
in my high school days.

[ Chuckles ]

00:02:03.656 --> 00:02:05.424 size:72% position:64%
I shook hands
with that stinky pinky.

00:02:05.457 --> 00:02:06.893 align:start size:72% position:28%
Mm.

00:02:06.926 --> 00:02:08.861 align:start position:0%
I got hand sanitizer
in the dressing room.

00:02:08.894 --> 00:02:10.096 align:start size:84% position:16%
I'm right.

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:11.130 size:81% position:41%
I ain't gonna come in here
and infect you,

00:02:11.163 --> 00:02:12.131 size:78% position:39%
you know what I'm saying,

00:02:12.164 --> 00:02:14.000 size:78% position:39%
'cause you is a white man
in a robe,

00:02:14.033 --> 00:02:16.536
and you might be
very responsible for my future.

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:17.837 size:63% position:31%
You know what
I'm talking about?

[ Laughs ]

00:02:19.772 --> 00:02:22.742 size:72% position:64%
I hope I am responsible
for your future

00:02:22.775 --> 00:02:24.441 align:start size:78% position:22%
because you're in charge.
