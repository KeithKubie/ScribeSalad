00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.050
There is a specialist for
each of these body systems.

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:06.490
A cardiologist for the heart.

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:09.390
A pulmonary specialist for the lungs.

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:12.220
An endocrinologist for diabetes.

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:15.050
And an internist to manage hypertension.

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:19.510
Unless Marla develops a particularly
severe issue, a PCP might manage

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:24.060
all of these problems,
with occasional help from a specialist.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.050
Since she doesn't have a PCP,
she ends up just seeing specialists.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.620
Unless things change, this trend toward
specialty care is projected to grow.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.420
By now you're probably wondering
why this is a problem.

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.950
Primary care physicians have been shown

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.110
to deliver similar quality to
specialists for certain conditions,

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:52.630
such as diabetes and hypertension,
often while using fewer resources.

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:56.420
They often provide better
preventative care than specialists,

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.640
reflecting their ability to better
manage the whole health of patients and

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.190
can help reduce hospitalization rates.
