1
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:02,590
Two.
One.

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,230
Hello Michelle. How's it going? And
really crack my neck. Oh, go ahead.

3
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:11,580
Crack your neck. Put it up. Put the
microphone to it so we can hear it.

4
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:15,510
Does it pop? Ooh, that was a good one.

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,000
That was a good one.
Did you do that all the time?

6
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:22,860
It's just when I'm getting ready
to throw down. Pull this up.

7
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:26,460
Microphone. Like a fist from your face.
There we go. Yeah. Perfect. Perfect.

8
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:27,703
So what's happening?

9
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:32,450
No, we're just in town. Um, uh,
my brother in law just moved,

10
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,490
just got stationed here in California,

11
00:00:34,491 --> 00:00:39,310
so we drove them down and then we
did the whole, um, no, I think it's,

12
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:42,680
it's actually an hour south of here.

13
00:00:42,681 --> 00:00:45,980
I think it's not close by,

14
00:00:45,981 --> 00:00:50,100
but cool air force.
And so we did the whole thing.

15
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:54,740
Yes. Yeah. So he got stationed there.

16
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,910
That was the first time I ever
saw, um, a stealth bomber.

17
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:01,760
It was like at right after nine
one, one we were filming, um, uh,

18
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:05,860
fear factor out there and I saw one fly
overhead. It's like a Ufo was like, wow,

19
00:01:05,861 --> 00:01:09,280
that is crazy. Does it look like a
Ufo? Yeah. It doesn't even look real.

20
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:13,210
You ever seen one in real life? It
looks like, Huh? Like a Batmobile, like,

21
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:17,770
like Batman's plane. It's so crazy when
you see one fly and you're like, wow,

22
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:21,040
the engineering involved in
something like that. It's insane.

23
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:23,980
And that was a while back. Yeah, sure.

24
00:01:23,981 --> 00:01:26,920
It was 2001 because it
was right after nine 11.

25
00:01:26,921 --> 00:01:29,500
So it was 2000 that's it right there.
That's what we saw on of them.

26
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:30,870
One of them is a,
there's,

27
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,460
it'd be two and this is like a
f one 16 or something like that.

28
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,730
I don't know which one we saw,
but it was black and wicked looking

29
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:39,190
nice.
That's crazy.

30
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,940
It looks like your Tesla flying
around and one of those things.

31
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:46,570
That's what we thought. Imagine back then,
that's what it looked like back then.

32
00:01:46,571 --> 00:01:49,150
So what, what, what is there
now? You probably can't see him.

33
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:53,380
I'd probably look like the sky. I
probably owe you from military background.

34
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,680
My Dad. Yeah, my dad was him.
So that's where my parents met.

35
00:01:56,681 --> 00:01:58,330
My Dad was stationed in Germany.

36
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:02,890
My mom was fleeing Thailand.
Um,

37
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:07,960
to her, her first husband was
like physically abusive to her.

38
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:12,430
So she was leaving Thailand and she came
to Germany to find her a Gi and then

39
00:02:12,431 --> 00:02:16,990
found my dad. She came to find a
Gi specifically. Well, you know,

40
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,900
I think she's coming to get away,
but she wanted to,

41
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:23,410
she wanted a better life
for her son at the time.

42
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:29,010
And my dad was in the hospital and so my
mom was taking care of them and cooking

43
00:02:29,021 --> 00:02:33,160
and food and made him fall in love it.

44
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:36,760
My Dad always jokes, he says, he tells
us a story all the time. He's like, yeah,

45
00:02:36,761 --> 00:02:38,350
your mom was taking care of me.

46
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:44,110
And then she told me that you were
pregnant and then 12 months later you were

47
00:02:44,111 --> 00:02:48,040
born. Oh, that's funny. So,

48
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,840
but now they fell in love.

49
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:55,330
It was just a really long pregnancy.
This weird, just kind of weird.

50
00:02:55,331 --> 00:02:56,330
I don't know why.
Yes,

51
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:00,220
I don't know. But that was
very small, but no. Yeah.

52
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:05,221
And then so then we moved to Colorado
and I was born then we lived in Germany

53
00:03:05,801 --> 00:03:07,150
for a little bit when I was younger.

54
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:11,230
And then back to Colorado and I grew
up in Aurora, Colorado. Oh, cool.

55
00:03:11,231 --> 00:03:16,210
When did you start training? Um, probably
around 10. Yeah. Yeah, around 10.

56
00:03:16,211 --> 00:03:18,790
Um, I have, I have an older brother,
he's four years older than me.

57
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:20,470
He's my half brother. And, um,

58
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:24,160
I really wanted to do gymnastics
as a kid and my parents just,

59
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:28,770
we just couldn't afford, it was really
expensive. And so my brother found, um,

60
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:31,840
a little karate spot at the church,

61
00:03:31,841 --> 00:03:36,100
just across the street and it was
a community, like a community,

62
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:41,980
a karate thing. And so it's something that
all three of us could do. And so yeah,

63
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:45,040
we jumped into it and I fell
in love with it. I just,

64
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:48,130
it just took over my life and changed,
changed my life.

65
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:52,330
Did you start competing really
quickly? Yeah, I think so. Um,

66
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,200
and at first it's funny because at first,
um,

67
00:03:56,350 --> 00:04:01,350
so I would do like the karate tournament
and so there's point sparring and then

68
00:04:01,391 --> 00:04:04,570
there's the Cahtos and I
thought the Cahtos were silly.

69
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:10,380
And I remember going in and doing point
sparring and I'm getting knocked on my

70
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:12,740
button. I was like, okay, I think I,

71
00:04:12,741 --> 00:04:16,640
I want to do some cod is then I want
to bring some trophies home. So,

72
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:20,740
but um, so yeah, I competed co put uh,

73
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:24,070
karate from 10 all the
way up until I was 18.

74
00:04:24,071 --> 00:04:29,050
And so I did a lot of the like the
flashy, like, um, extreme martial arts,

75
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:33,940
Carter's with the, um, like the flips
and stuff like that. But I always,

76
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:38,560
I always came back to sparring
because I wasn't good at it.

77
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:44,080
Like I was like, ah, it, it
bugged me. It bugged me that
I, that I wasn't good at it.

78
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,810
And then I found my niche
because it's point sparring,

79
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,170
so you get to two points to
the head for kicks to the head.

80
00:04:50,171 --> 00:04:53,410
So I would just sit back and let him
come in and just kick him in the head.

81
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,010
I'm Cuban had come
times and win the fight.

82
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,900
So how did you go from that to,

83
00:04:58,901 --> 00:05:02,890
did you go from that to kickboxing
or did you go right into MMA?

84
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,690
Like when did you,
when did you just start training?

85
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:08,120
So,
so I did,

86
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:11,630
I did karate and then I got
my black belt in karate,

87
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:15,170
what kind of American freestyle.
And then,

88
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:19,070
so I think around 18 or 19,
I was kind of just exploring,

89
00:05:19,071 --> 00:05:20,510
doing a couple of different things.
So I did,

90
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:24,890
we'll shoot for a couple of years and I
competed in wool shoe and then I did a

91
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:26,870
little bit of Campbell and um,

92
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:31,460
and then kind of dabbled a
little bit into um, kickboxing.

93
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,930
And uh,
so it,

94
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:38,930
it kind of just happened pretty strangely.
I was in college,

95
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,520
I was working at Hooters and I was doing
the, all these like little side jobs.

96
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:47,540
I'm like, fuck doing photo
shoots for this and that. And um,

97
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:51,910
I was a ring girl for MMA shell.
I hadn't ever seen MMA.

98
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,860
And I remember,
uh,

99
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:59,030
just walking around the cage and
thinking I want to be like on the inside.

100
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:00,350
I that one that looks cool.

101
00:06:00,351 --> 00:06:03,200
I think I could do it cause it
was mixed martial arts, you know,

102
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:08,060
and I remember talking to her motor and
he kind of laughed me off and was just

103
00:06:08,061 --> 00:06:11,750
like, whatever, you know,
you're a ring girl. And, um,

104
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,850
it was a smaller local show.

105
00:06:13,851 --> 00:06:18,620
Donald Cerrone was actually fighting on
that show and he overheard me yeah. In,

106
00:06:18,621 --> 00:06:23,000
so he came to my work at Hooters and I
wasn't there and he was just like left me

107
00:06:23,001 --> 00:06:27,040
know if serious about fighting, get your
ass in the gym. Wow. Then there was,

108
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,380
this is in Colorado,
Colorado. And then I saw,

109
00:06:30,381 --> 00:06:34,340
I went to go train and went to go train
and wood with Donald and you know, we, we,

110
00:06:34,341 --> 00:06:38,970
Jim hopped from place to play is
I trained with, um, with Duane.

111
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:43,630
I trained, um, with Trevor.
I trained with, with, with
all the guys. Wow. And, um,

112
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,480
and so I took a couple of
smokers would drive, you know,

113
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:51,980
drive around the region and, and
took a couple smokers and then, um,

114
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:55,200
it was like at that point when
I was still in college and, um,

115
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:58,010
I just was not happy in college.
I,

116
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:03,070
I was kind of wandering around aimlessly
is really successful in high school and

117
00:07:03,561 --> 00:07:05,930
uh, you know, um,

118
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:11,430
it just didn't transfer over to college.
I, I still, I got good grades. I was 3.8,

119
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:15,950
you know, I was going to do
you, but I wasn't happy. I just,

120
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:19,950
I there was something missing and it was,
it was the martial arts.

121
00:07:19,951 --> 00:07:21,560
So this is a big part of my life.

122
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,930
And you needed a real challenge. Yeah.
It's something physical to probably right.

123
00:07:24,931 --> 00:07:25,350
Yeah.

124
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:29,220
I would imagine that someone growing up
doing martial arts as long as you did,

125
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:32,790
you like the thrill of using
your body and moving around.

126
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,520
It's like that it's so important.
Like once,

127
00:07:35,521 --> 00:07:38,220
once you do that and you compete
and it's becomes a part of,

128
00:07:38,221 --> 00:07:42,270
you did the idea of like sitting in the
classroom all day and then eventually

129
00:07:42,271 --> 00:07:46,170
sitting in a job all day, that's
probably not, not that compelling.

130
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:49,240
Yeah, I think so. I think that, um,

131
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:53,890
I just loved going to school for,
I was going to school,

132
00:07:53,891 --> 00:07:56,830
so I was double majoring in
theater and sports science.

133
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:00,940
So was majoring in theater because I
got a scholarship for it and I was doing

134
00:08:00,941 --> 00:08:04,690
sports science. I wanted to be
like physical therapist for um,

135
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:10,030
like a sports team or something like
that or even a martial arts team. But uh,

136
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,740
yeah, so I, I decided to take a,

137
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:14,740
like a little bit like a
break from that and my mom,

138
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:19,720
my grandma was sick in Thailand.
So then I was like, I told my mom,

139
00:08:19,721 --> 00:08:23,350
I just go with her for the summer and
he went to visit my grandma and Thailand

140
00:08:23,351 --> 00:08:25,330
and all those out there. I, um,

141
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:30,690
I went to sit your tongue more Thai camp
and I absolutely fell in love with it.

142
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,670
They made fun of me because of my,
my karate kicks.

143
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:39,340
Yeah. It's interesting how, how different
karate kicks are. Yeah. Thai kicks.

144
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:41,860
Yeah. And they were looking at me like
I was crazy, but it was like, but no,

145
00:08:41,861 --> 00:08:44,950
I'm a black belt.
I know what I'm doing there.

146
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:49,660
Just laughing at me with
training on concrete outside
these little five year old

147
00:08:49,661 --> 00:08:53,090
kids are doing 10 year old,
10 minute rounds. And um,

148
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:57,210
my feet are blistering up from kicking
and over and over on the concrete.

149
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:59,370
But I loved it.
I fell in love with it.

150
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:03,090
It kicked my butt and I fell in love
with it and I came back and I dropped out

151
00:09:03,091 --> 00:09:05,040
of college and I decided to

152
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:09,000
pursue fighting. Wow. So
where did you learn grappling?

153
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,260
It's so,
so my first MMA fight was kind of just,

154
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:19,090
it was supposed to be an amateur
fight and I'm, like I said,

155
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:20,560
it was training with,
um,

156
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:24,100
with Donald and he was
training at a school in Vail.

157
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:30,160
And so I would, I would
go to, I would, um,

158
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:35,920
I would work on the weekends and
then drive up to Vail and train,

159
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:42,580
uh, my grappling and all of it, like
the, like all of the MMA. And so,

160
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:47,280
so you basically train MMA together. He
didn't take specific grapping in classes,

161
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,220
but would've imagined that that was the
thing that you needed to concentrate on

162
00:09:50,221 --> 00:09:50,820
the most,
right?

163
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:55,670
[inaudible]. Yeah. And I figured, okay,
is my, my, my pro day or it wasn't,

164
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,630
it was supposed to be amateur,

165
00:09:56,631 --> 00:10:01,631
but the girl that I was supposed to
fight fell through and I'm the only girl

166
00:10:02,241 --> 00:10:05,120
that they had available was already
pro. She was like two, no pro.

167
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:09,800
And of course you know how Donald is,
he's like, whatever. Fuck it, just do it.

168
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:14,270
And so that's a good Donald
accent. So I was like, all right.

169
00:10:14,271 --> 00:10:19,080
I mean we've been training.
So I literally had four weeks in my,

170
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:22,550
um, in my, like throughout
my, my karate career,

171
00:10:22,551 --> 00:10:25,100
we would have grappling nights
when we would do grappling,

172
00:10:25,101 --> 00:10:29,740
but it wasn't anything like
substantial. So yeah, four weeks of,

173
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:33,860
of grappling training and
I figured, okay, you know,

174
00:10:33,861 --> 00:10:37,190
I'll just use my stand up to,
to win the fight.

175
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:41,960
And she was swinging from, from way back
here and trying to take my head off.

176
00:10:41,961 --> 00:10:44,240
So I ended up taking her down.

177
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:47,340
I ended up taking down like
six or seven times and,

178
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:50,420
and winning the fight by taking
her down in ground and pounding.

179
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:55,610
That's crazy. Yeah. That's crazy. Did you
say while you were doing it? Like, wow,

180
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:59,120
this is so weird that I'm doing this.
It was,

181
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:04,460
I wasn't thinking at all. I was just in
the moment having the time of my life.

182
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:07,550
Were you thinking that this was
what you're going to wind up doing,

183
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,450
like professionally or were you just
thinking, I can't believe I'm doing this?

184
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:15,380
I, yeah, that's exactly what I
was like, this is so much fun. Um,

185
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:16,630
it was that the Broomfield events or not,

186
00:11:16,631 --> 00:11:19,520
I dunno if that's still called
the Broomfield, the Ben Center

187
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:22,690
in Colorado, but yeah, I think a
bank owns it now or something. Yeah,

188
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:26,730
those changed names. It was so much fun,
but never in my life. I thought I would,

189
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:31,070
I would be a top UFC contender.
Never. And on your way,

190
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:36,320
your goal is to be the first mommy yeah.
To ever a title. Yeah. That's possible.

191
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:40,500
100%. You're in the, you're in the hunt
right now. Like what are you ranked? Um,

192
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:42,560
ranked seven,
seventh,

193
00:11:42,561 --> 00:11:46,430
but I don't think the
rankings are anything.

194
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,130
They're weird. They're weird. Yeah.

195
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,130
There's like sometimes someone will beat
somebody and then that person is still

196
00:11:52,131 --> 00:11:54,800
ahead of in the racking. I'm
like, explain that. I just,

197
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:57,530
I don't understand the rankings though.
I feel like I've,

198
00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:01,420
I've won my last two fights and I've
gone down and rankings you want to,

199
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:04,510
hasn't fought and she's
gone down in rankings. Um,

200
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,580
and some of the girls haven't fought
and they've gone up and rankings. Uh,

201
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:10,270
I just think the rankings are crazy.
Yeah.

202
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:14,160
Well it's a bunch of people get
to submit their positions. Right.

203
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:18,940
Like a bunch of journalists
and excepted experts on MMA.

204
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:22,180
Good to have an idea.
I guess when I look at them and,

205
00:12:22,181 --> 00:12:26,260
because sometimes I feel like it shifts
depending on who they're trying to push

206
00:12:26,261 --> 00:12:30,940
or, you know, just sometimes I feel
like just storyline kind of can dictate.

207
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:36,310
Yeah. The, the rankings, you know,
obviously I'm a giant fan of the UFC.

208
00:12:36,311 --> 00:12:37,300
I loved them to death.

209
00:12:37,301 --> 00:12:42,301
I'm so happy and I just would do
nothing for any other organization.

210
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,610
They never want to work
for another organization,

211
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,260
but I don't like the way they do things.

212
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:49,750
There's a lot of things that I don't like.
They just stay as cut.

213
00:12:49,751 --> 00:12:54,130
Elias Theodora really? Yeah.
One loss. Derek Robertson cut.

214
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:58,320
I'm like what? They cut Derek Beth. No,
he lost the dark hair. I was like, what?

215
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:02,110
Just one. I'm like, explain that.
How do you explain that one?

216
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,430
That one doesn't make any sense.

217
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:07,600
There's like some match ups don't
make any sense. Interim title shots.

218
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:12,040
Those are preposterous. It's crazy. Yeah.
I mean I understand it's, it's as machine,

219
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:15,130
it has to work and they're
trying, but it just, it, um,

220
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:19,450
especially for like a fighter
whose life depends on yeah,

221
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,980
the fights and you know,

222
00:13:20,981 --> 00:13:24,670
your livelihood depends on that and
for it do you just to be out. Yeah.

223
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:28,570
It's stressful enough to only fight a
couple of times a year because you have to

224
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,950
divvy up that, that person
money throughout those
times, you know? But yeah.

225
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:34,510
Well I think

226
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:39,550
pupil like you are very important for
women's MMA because you seem so normal.

227
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:44,240
You know what I mean? Like there's some
women, you talked to them, you're like,

228
00:13:44,241 --> 00:13:46,880
well, this girl's fucking crazy.
No wonder why she's a fighter.

229
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:47,990
You know what I mean?

230
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:52,340
Like there's some girls that are real
aggressive or just that like you talked to

231
00:13:52,341 --> 00:13:57,290
Amanda Nunez. You like, I
get it. Yeah. She should be
a fighter. She's, she's cool.

232
00:13:57,291 --> 00:14:02,000
She's so cool. She's so cool.
But that's a bad ass bitch. Yeah.

233
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:04,050
You know what I mean? She'll
fuck people up. You could tell.

234
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:07,610
You could tell just looking at her,
you know, like the way she's built.

235
00:14:07,611 --> 00:14:11,600
She's wide did. You can tell she's
got power and she looks like a girl.

236
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:12,890
You would not want to fuck with

237
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:16,970
Josh. You called it, Josh called it. He
said, ETF that she'd knock out Cyborg.

238
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:21,220
That was crazy. That was
crazy that that was, I didn't,

239
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,890
I didn't think that she could
knock her out. I thought,

240
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:26,500
I think she could knock out anyone.
I mean, I think she could not.

241
00:14:26,501 --> 00:14:31,290
I think Amanda Nunez can knock out a
lot of guys. She hits so hard. Yeah.

242
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:35,830
But I thought that there would
be a big weight disadvantage.

243
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:38,290
Cyborg has a tremendous
experience advantage,

244
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:40,840
and she's never shown herself to
be someone that gets hurt. Yeah.

245
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:44,470
But even when she fought Juliana bars,
did you ever see that fight in lion fight?

246
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:44,990
I

247
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:47,600
remember seeing highlights of it
cause she's just like stuck in the uh,

248
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:50,930
on the ropes and Georgina is a elite

249
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:56,810
and Cyborg got dropped and kept coming
and mean she was pursuing her in the

250
00:14:56,811 --> 00:14:57,920
final rounds.
Yeah.

251
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:01,520
I mean she was chasing after she lost
the decision but she gained a lot of fans

252
00:15:01,521 --> 00:15:05,450
because she didn't have any pro Moy Thai
fights and she fought a woman who like

253
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:08,690
she couldn't get a fight for almost
three years cause girls were ducking her.

254
00:15:08,691 --> 00:15:11,780
Yeah cause they didn't want to fight
her more ties. Brutal. I feel like

255
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:15,190
because my husband and I
talk about this all the time,

256
00:15:15,191 --> 00:15:17,510
cause it MMA you have options.
Like if you have,

257
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:19,750
if you're having trouble in the stand up,
you can take them down,

258
00:15:19,751 --> 00:15:21,340
you can work your grappling this or that.

259
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,500
In boxing you don't really have
much options. Either you give up,

260
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,250
you get knocked out or you give
up, you know, in the corner.

261
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:32,500
And I felt the same way in might type
set for now you're introducing knees and

262
00:15:32,501 --> 00:15:37,360
Shins and elbows. Yeah. Cut.
And you have no way out.

263
00:15:37,361 --> 00:15:39,380
Like, yeah. You know, so that's,

264
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:44,510
yeah, that's a rough sport and an
incredibly exciting sports watch.

265
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:49,400
And one that I've never understood me
boxing so gigantic in this country and

266
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:52,640
Moitai has almost no
presence. And I, I've just,

267
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:56,900
it baffles me to no end. I mean that
they have the product. Yeah. I mean,

268
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:00,440
and they have great American fighters.
I mean like Joe Schilling, Kevin Ross,

269
00:16:00,441 --> 00:16:02,900
and there's, there's a ton of them
and this guys like John Wayne,

270
00:16:02,901 --> 00:16:06,950
par from Australia and all these
guys are exciting to watch and fun.

271
00:16:06,951 --> 00:16:10,040
And then there's so many
elite kids that are coming up,

272
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:15,240
but there's no mainstream appeal. It
doesn't, I don't understand that. No, no.

273
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,250
I either,
yeah,

274
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:21,230
that is crazy to think they need a thing
like the UFC or something comes along

275
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:25,430
and they dump a ton of money into it.
But the thing is like, there's only,

276
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:30,200
people only have so much time to
watch things, so it's like, oh,

277
00:16:30,201 --> 00:16:34,100
Deontay wilder is fighting. I'll
watch that. Oh, you know, uh,

278
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:37,700
Tyron Woodley's fighting. I'll watch
him. Yeah. Oh, Jon Jones is fighting.

279
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:41,030
I'll watch that. What's
this? Moitai ah, this fights.

280
00:16:41,031 --> 00:16:43,520
I'm going to watch Bella towards debt.
I'm going to watch that instead.

281
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:47,230
It's like there's, it's almost like too
saturated. Yeah, that's true. But it's,

282
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:51,920
it's a shame. It'd be cool if they had
like a card with all different types of,

283
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:56,450
of fighting. That's what one does. You
know, the all on the same night. Yes.

284
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:58,670
One FC does that.
They'll have kickboxing,

285
00:16:58,671 --> 00:17:03,210
Muay Thai MMA in one night
and they'll have no, no,

286
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,270
they let everybody know
this is what they're doing.

287
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:08,570
I think one is doing fantastic.
They're there. They're doing their,

288
00:17:08,571 --> 00:17:10,430
they're putting on amazing fights.
I mean,

289
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:14,810
and we've seen that these are like
legitimately worldclass fighters.

290
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:17,930
They're beating guys like they,
you know, um, Timothy nuts.

291
00:17:17,931 --> 00:17:21,890
You can just beat Eddie Alvarez knocked
him out and that was crazy. Yeah.

292
00:17:21,891 --> 00:17:24,110
And they're also,
they cut out all the weight cutting.

293
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,280
There's no way cutting over there.

294
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:30,170
So like when sage Northcutt fought a
cosmo Alexandra [inaudible] vitamin 185

295
00:17:30,171 --> 00:17:33,070
pounds because that's really what
he walks around. Yeah. You know,

296
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,300
so there's no way cutting
over there was a brutal hit.

297
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:39,680
Then he got caught with crazy. I'm,
I'm glad that he's okay, but he's okay.

298
00:17:39,681 --> 00:17:42,950
But yeah, his, his faces
had eight fractures.

299
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:47,120
Do you think it's better for him to
cut down? That's a good question.

300
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:50,070
Very good question. Because I
mean, if he's getting knocked out

301
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:50,611
by that,

302
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:55,570
and I'm wondering if maybe he should
be walking around lighter or if,

303
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:57,630
I don't know,
cause he's pretty lean already

304
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:02,480
his lien, but that's, that
fight played out realistically.

305
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:06,920
Uh, not, not that it's better for him or
worse for him, but sage is a young guy.

306
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,200
He's 21 or 22 years old.

307
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:13,490
He's got a limited amount of
worldclass Moitai experience.

308
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:17,680
He fought cosmo who was a multiple
time world champion. Yeah.

309
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,060
And it's just a bad
fight. Why, why did they,

310
00:18:20,061 --> 00:18:22,980
why would they set that up
if they're trying to build
them? It's easy to like, I,

311
00:18:22,981 --> 00:18:25,610
I've said that too. And people were like,
oh, it's easy to say after the fact,

312
00:18:25,611 --> 00:18:28,850
you're right. But if I was in
sage as corner going, hey bro,

313
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:31,070
there's a lot of fights we should take.

314
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:34,810
And that was [inaudible] knows
who's an MMA fight. Okay.

315
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:38,390
But sage is not a wrestler. Yeah. I
mean he has taken guys down before,

316
00:18:38,391 --> 00:18:41,150
but I would absolutely
say that's the game plan.

317
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:44,900
The game plan is tie this guy up
and drag him to the ground. Don't,

318
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:45,860
don't be standing with us.

319
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:49,640
I just feel like if you've,
if you have a background in something,

320
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:54,860
in stressful situations, you always
revert back to what you know. Sure.

321
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:58,970
Yeah. So even if he did work as wrestling,
he's gonna Revert back to his, you know,

322
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,710
really hoppy movie stance and, and
that's, that's what it looked like.

323
00:19:03,711 --> 00:19:07,040
What happened? He was kind of pulling
out, hop and back and got caught. Yeah.

324
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:10,550
Well he was trying that sideways
karate style stance. You know,

325
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:14,180
Cosmo's just super elite.
And you saw if you saw the fight,

326
00:19:14,181 --> 00:19:16,160
he fainted a couple times with the left.

327
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:18,770
He set them up like with
a switch a couple times.

328
00:19:18,771 --> 00:19:23,660
And then as sage circled off,
he went to his right and cracked him.

329
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:28,130
Well, that guy's just a
super elite fighter. I mean,

330
00:19:28,131 --> 00:19:30,230
when it comes to striking,

331
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:35,500
I feel like that is where being elite
is the most dangerous for an opponent.

332
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,720
You know? Uh, I feel like if someone,

333
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:42,080
if you find an elite Jujitsu guy and
he catches you and he submits you,

334
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:46,820
you live another day, you know, like
Neil magazine, Damien Maia, we found out,

335
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:50,420
you know, Damian gets him to the ground
and just strangles him, right? Yeah.

336
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:51,283
But that's,

337
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:55,880
he'll be all right if you get
chaos by an elite striker.

338
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:59,630
Who knows what kind of damage
happens to you. You know, when,

339
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:04,010
when his face got broken and he's
had eight fractures in his face,

340
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:07,280
his cheek, his warbird old, they had
a piece them back together again.

341
00:20:07,281 --> 00:20:10,010
He chose attached. Do
you know? I don't know.

342
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:13,280
I don't know the extent of the injuries.
He, she, he posted up some images though.

343
00:20:13,281 --> 00:20:17,600
Did you see the images of the x
rays? It's like, whoa. Like this is,

344
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,833
it was horrible.

345
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,770
Yeah.
I mean so,

346
00:20:21,771 --> 00:20:24,620
so that's how I feel against,
um,

347
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:28,190
do you do to people when
they submit me I'm like, ah,
okay. Like let's do it again.

348
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:33,230
Yeah, exactly. Well, what about
unjudged and rose? I was scared.

349
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:35,130
I was scared for rose.

350
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:38,780
Was it really bad landing landing on
her neck, like that was terrifying.

351
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:41,950
Lots of it scared me just
cause we were in Brazil to,

352
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,000
that crowd was crazy and everybody shot
up and started screaming and rose just

353
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,070
like

354
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:52,660
laid out on the canvas and I kind of was
just like wanting her corner to be in

355
00:20:52,661 --> 00:20:55,920
there with her cause she was just
all alone by herself, you know?

356
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:58,360
And I was worried that she wasn't
going to get up. I was like, Hey,

357
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:02,440
you guys like wait to cheer until we
see she's okay. Cause that can parallel.

358
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:08,140
If you look at the impact, have you seen
the photograph of the landing itself?

359
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:11,710
I mean it's, it's one of the
worst ways you get ever land.

360
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:16,750
She's essentially headfirst with the neck,
sideways and um,

361
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:21,160
flat or negative space. Yeah. It's
like someone was cranking on her neck.

362
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:25,420
I was like, horrible. Yeah, that was a bad
landing. I mean the whole thing was bad.

363
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:29,140
She's going for the Camorra.
Um, Jessica picks her up.

364
00:21:29,141 --> 00:21:32,920
She doesn't lace a leg and she
holds onto the Camorra, which you,

365
00:21:32,921 --> 00:21:37,240
you just can't do. You just can't do it.
You got to let it go know. But she, she's,

366
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:40,180
she's held on to things
before and you know,

367
00:21:40,181 --> 00:21:44,950
and caught armbars and triangles and
it's one of those things, you know,

368
00:21:44,951 --> 00:21:46,720
you make a mistake.
So,

369
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:50,890
cause I know people were talking about
it being illegal to slam somebody like

370
00:21:50,891 --> 00:21:53,320
that. She didn't do it on purpose.
She just tried to slam her.

371
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:56,500
I mean she's just trying to take,
lift her up and dump it down.

372
00:21:56,830 --> 00:22:01,480
I mean the illegal slamming is
like when Minataro fought Bob Sapp.

373
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:02,440
Do you remember that?
Nope.

374
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:06,970
Military fought Bob Sapp and Bob Sapp
literally got them in a pile driver where

375
00:22:06,971 --> 00:22:11,971
he scooped and Bob Sapp was 370 pounds
with abs and on everything that Mexico

376
00:22:13,601 --> 00:22:17,080
has to offer, every steroid that
was available. Bob Sapp was on.

377
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:19,540
They said that he used to
travel with like a briefcase.

378
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:24,250
Phil would roids I mean he was a
goddamn science project at one point.

379
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:28,480
It was fascinating to watch,
right? Because I think to this day,

380
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:33,160
that was probably one of the greatest
victories in all of MMA. Minataro who was,

381
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:38,760
he was outweighed by a good
solid hundred and 3,040 pounds,

382
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:44,680
like legitimately and still
got an arm bar off Bob Sapp.

383
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:49,810
Jamie got it. Yeah. Watch this.
So look at the size difference.

384
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:54,790
First of all, just see the beginning of
the fight scene. So he shoots, he shoots,

385
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:58,600
but look at the size difference when
you see them come out. It is so crazy.

386
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:02,830
Bob Sapp was so big,
but look at this. Boom.

387
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:07,660
So that now many Taros neck was
fucked up from that forever.

388
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:12,430
Like that haunted him his
entire career. Watch this. Boom.

389
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:13,600
Yup.
Yup.

390
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:18,220
See He tucks his head a little bit at
the last second so he doesn't catch it on

391
00:23:18,221 --> 00:23:22,270
the top of the head, but all
of his weight, all of Bob
Sam's. Wait, look at that.

392
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:27,340
Why don't you think he tucked it? I
think it just gave him, he kept going.

393
00:23:27,341 --> 00:23:29,050
Any fucking submitted them?
We have a,

394
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:32,170
Toro was one of the toughest guys that's
ever walked the face of the planet.

395
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:37,420
Look at this. He scoots out. He
escapes and gets on top of them.

396
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:40,030
Yeah.
Well look at the size difference.

397
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:46,190
500 and [inaudible] I mean he,
Bob was so big and he's probably

398
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:50,810
on Epo fucking everything.
And Look, look at that.

399
00:23:50,811 --> 00:23:55,130
Just wind millin with his legs. He
was, and he was trained by Maury Smith.

400
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:59,280
You know, Maurice was training. I'm
so, he was a legitimate, uh, you know,

401
00:23:59,281 --> 00:24:03,890
it will legitimately trained athlete
and he was so big. So these were,

402
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:06,560
this is back in the day when
there's like 10 minute rounds,

403
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:11,120
10 minute first round. So
Minotaur, I believe I went
into the second round though.

404
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:14,150
I want to say,
oh my God.

405
00:24:14,151 --> 00:24:17,790
Don't remember entirely whether it went
into the second round, but I want to say,

406
00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:20,900
yeah, yeah. I mean, look,

407
00:24:20,901 --> 00:24:24,920
he beat her Nesto who's
twice in kickboxing matches,

408
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:30,260
but also goes to show you how hard cro
cop punches cause cro cop flattened him

409
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:31,340
with one punch.

410
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:35,600
[inaudible] broke his orbital
bone with a straight left.

411
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:40,100
So Minataro eventually
gets him on his back.

412
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:42,320
And then once he gets him
on his bag as Bob Sapp,

413
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:45,800
like you can only keep 375
pounds going for so long. I mean,

414
00:24:45,801 --> 00:24:49,760
he's just completely exhausted.
Steroids. You do. Yeah.

415
00:24:49,761 --> 00:24:50,810
So this is the end.

416
00:24:50,811 --> 00:24:54,980
He ties up his arm and catches him
in an arm bar and Bob's have taps.

417
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:58,610
And I was at my friend
fuck whose house was at,

418
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:01,280
but I was with Eddie Bravo when
we saw this and were screaming,

419
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:05,240
we couldn't believe it. We
couldn't believe it because
it was like a victory for,

420
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:09,510
it was a victory for technique, you
know? That's what it was. It was,

421
00:25:09,511 --> 00:25:13,190
it was a victory for Jujitsu was a
victory for technique over broad.

422
00:25:13,191 --> 00:25:16,040
And there's a perfect example
of technique over brawn.

423
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,460
Not that material doesn't have Bron
and not that Bob Sapp doesn't have

424
00:25:19,461 --> 00:25:22,490
techniques, but if they're the same
size, Minataro would've fucked him up.

425
00:25:22,491 --> 00:25:25,010
It would've been,
it would've been an easy fight for him.

426
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:29,480
It's just weather the storm and wasn't
scared to be in there with them. Yeah.

427
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:31,700
Fader wouldn't fight them.
Faders said fucked up.

428
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:34,430
They offered fatal or fight with
pop size like, Nah, I'm good.

429
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,860
And he fought Hahnemann Choi when hundred
and Troy was like seven feet tall.

430
00:25:37,861 --> 00:25:40,760
You remember that fight caught him in
there was was one of the most ridiculous

431
00:25:40,761 --> 00:25:41,481
armbars ever.

432
00:25:41,481 --> 00:25:44,390
He caught him in an arm bar and the
arm is as long as this fucking table.

433
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:45,950
It's so crazy.

434
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:51,010
That was a ridiculous armbar ridiculous.

435
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:55,310
Armbar but you'll never see any
fights like that happen. Not Anymore.

436
00:25:55,970 --> 00:26:00,530
Well, I still think someone, someone
might do it. Yeah. Rise and could do it.

437
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,810
There's two do fucked up
things with Gabby Garcia.

438
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:06,290
You've seen that hazy Gabby Garcia's
a science project and a half.

439
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:11,400
That's crazy. What is
that? What's going on? Uh,

440
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:15,890
not that I'm aware of. How are they going
to find someone? A woman is 240 pounds.

441
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,000
She's 240 pounds jacked and she's legit
black belt in Brazilian Jujitsu and

442
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:25,820
she's, you know, she's legitimately
tough. I thought I saw the video of her.

443
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:29,970
I'm grappling with Mckinsey and Mckinsey,
like almost the Kinsey bitter,

444
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:33,590
I think Mckinsey Vader in a Jujitsu match.
And did you do too much?

445
00:26:33,591 --> 00:26:35,570
But in MMA I'll take anybody's be here.
Yeah.

446
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:39,080
I think Mackenzie either beat her
or how to draw one an advantage,

447
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:43,440
something like that. But it is, it is.

448
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:46,710
That's science. Okay. You're,
you're, you're doing some stuff.

449
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,960
You're doing some stuff
to people that it's not,

450
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:53,100
your body's not supposed to have that
in their lady. It's not, you know,

451
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:57,810
I mean it's, it's interesting cause
like, like the Bob Sapp thing,

452
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,530
like you get to see what happens.
Wow. Okay. This is what's,

453
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:03,390
when someone just goes for it.
And when pride,

454
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:07,290
ensign anyway was on the podcast and he,
and since hilarious,

455
00:27:07,291 --> 00:27:11,100
he was detailing the contract, he goes,
like, it's said in all capital letters,

456
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:14,580
we will not test you for steroids.
They were like,

457
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:18,300
that's what joy would tell me
all the time. Joey visa. No,

458
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:20,680
he's been in my shore for the
last couple of fights. Joe,

459
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:25,230
he's an excellent fighter, man. He would
say that. He said it almost, they almost,

460
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,990
um, encouraged courage. Not almost,

461
00:27:27,991 --> 00:27:32,991
they basically did encourage it because
they just wanted to see crazy things

462
00:27:34,031 --> 00:27:37,350
that like came out of comic books. You
know, they wanted you to be jacked.

463
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:41,910
They wanted you to be gigantic. Yeah.
I mean as long as everybody's doing it,

464
00:27:41,911 --> 00:27:44,580
I guess I would never,
I wouldn't want to do that.

465
00:27:44,581 --> 00:27:48,270
Even if I had the choice to do it. You
wouldn't want to write one too. Right.

466
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:50,160
I get it.
Will that makes sense.

467
00:27:50,161 --> 00:27:53,640
And that's why I think people like you
were important for MMA because you are,

468
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:57,630
you're a woman. You seem like a
woman. You behave like a woman.

469
00:27:57,631 --> 00:27:58,464
You look at a woman,

470
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:03,750
if someone say [inaudible] top 10 UFC
fight or you'd be like, what? No Way.

471
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:07,020
Really. She's so normal.
But if you saw it,

472
00:28:07,021 --> 00:28:09,510
Gabby Garcia and you know that
girl's smashing people in Japan,

473
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,470
like I fucking believe it

474
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:16,050
out of this room cause she hops
out and starts a flattened me.

475
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:20,490
I just like, I feel like it takes the, um,

476
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,433
the jaw.

477
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:26,180
I feel like it would take the joy out of
a victory for if you did steroids. Yeah.

478
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:28,590
Yeah. Well, you would
become something different.

479
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:32,070
The reality is a woman becomes something
different when she starts taking male

480
00:28:32,071 --> 00:28:35,910
hormones. You just do. He
becomes something different.
Your tendons strengthen.

481
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:39,180
Your bone structure changes.
Your voice deepens.

482
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:43,710
You become much more like a man. I mean,
that's when you see transgender women,

483
00:28:43,711 --> 00:28:47,760
when a woman rather is a transgender man,

484
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:50,700
she decides she wants to be a man.
They start taking testosterone,

485
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:55,350
they get beards, they have all sorts
of strange things happen down below,

486
00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:01,090
and they, they start having a deeper voice
and they sound like a man then that's,

487
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:04,380
that's exactly what happens to a woman
when a woman takes steroids if she's not

488
00:29:04,381 --> 00:29:06,060
trying to transition.
So same thing.

489
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:09,840
You just taking male hormones that
make your muscles grow far larger than

490
00:29:09,841 --> 00:29:10,830
they're supposed to.
Yeah.

491
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:15,060
I remember watching a movie
that they did in Thailand.

492
00:29:15,061 --> 00:29:18,930
It's called beautiful boxer. Yes,
yes. Yeah. It's the opposite. He, yes,

493
00:29:18,931 --> 00:29:21,900
he wanted to be a woman, but I think
he did it the right way. Right.

494
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,510
If there's a right way to do it because,
well,

495
00:29:24,511 --> 00:29:28,980
he started as a man and then became
a woman and kept fighting men.

496
00:29:28,981 --> 00:29:32,920
Yes. And I think that someone should
have told her at the time, like,

497
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:36,930
let's just stop fighting. Let's stop
fighting. Or I, this is my take on it.

498
00:29:36,931 --> 00:29:41,070
Like that she needed to keep fighting
so that she could pay for the surgery.

499
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:42,110
Yeah.

500
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:45,520
Yeah. All right. Catch 22 if
I ever was one. Yeah. Yeah,

501
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:49,780
but would it was an elite fighter until
the transition and then you see the

502
00:29:49,781 --> 00:29:54,160
skills start to diminish because
there's no more testosterone when she's

503
00:29:54,161 --> 00:29:56,650
fighting men.
But if she was fighting women,

504
00:29:56,651 --> 00:29:59,000
she would have a giant
advantage still over women.

505
00:29:59,001 --> 00:30:01,050
And I don't think that's right either.
I don't think that's fair either.

506
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:04,600
No one does. No one does accept
transgender people, transgender people,

507
00:30:04,601 --> 00:30:09,280
and super progressive activists
who have no idea how sports work.

508
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,230
It's,
those are the people,

509
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:15,250
the people that just want inclusiveness
and they just want everyone to be okay.

510
00:30:15,251 --> 00:30:17,980
And you know, maybe this is the
world I'm looking for. I'm looking,

511
00:30:17,981 --> 00:30:22,000
I'm looking towards a world where
everyone's included. Yeah. Good.

512
00:30:22,001 --> 00:30:26,230
Have a transgender league. I
have a transgender division.
No, I'm cool with that.

513
00:30:26,231 --> 00:30:28,630
I'll be happily happily support them.

514
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:32,290
But you're pretending that
that's a woman and it's not.

515
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:36,280
It's a male who's transitioning to a
woman. You have an x, y chromosome.

516
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:40,360
It's a different thing. Yeah. You
know, I'm 100% if a woman says,

517
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:45,350
I want to fight a transgender woman.
Okay, I'm a hundred that's fine. Yeah.

518
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:50,020
But like for leagues to recognize that
this is the same thing and like to say

519
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:54,520
like how would you feel if all of the
UFC is weight classes in the women's

520
00:30:54,521 --> 00:30:56,980
division,
we're dominated by transgender women.

521
00:30:57,620 --> 00:31:00,800
I would feel like there were some,

522
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,500
I feel like I should not say
something. Right, right, right. Yeah.

523
00:31:04,501 --> 00:31:05,750
Like I'm going to get caught up.

524
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:10,950
Yeah. Let me talk for you to fucking
bullshit. It's fucking bullshit, right?

525
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:12,480
Yeah.
You don't have to say anything.

526
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:16,220
And that's how girls feel right now
when there's sports being dominated and

527
00:31:16,221 --> 00:31:18,510
track and field. Yeah.
That's okay. That's not fair.

528
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:23,550
[inaudible]. I mean, I as, I guess for me,

529
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:27,390
I've always been, especially like being
a female in a male dominant sport,

530
00:31:27,391 --> 00:31:31,820
I've always, I've, I guess if I can let
the like to consider myself a feminist,

531
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:36,050
not, not so much a feminist, but
I like when I go into the gym, I,

532
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:38,730
my teammates look at me as a fighter.

533
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:41,550
Like they don't look at me as a
female fight or anything like that.

534
00:31:41,551 --> 00:31:43,610
They look at me as their teammate,
you know what I mean? And the,

535
00:31:43,611 --> 00:31:47,460
and I appreciate that. I appreciate that
they trade, treat me as an athlete and,

536
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:48,990
and,
and all of that good stuff.

537
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:53,850
But I feel like w like
at the end of the day,

538
00:31:53,851 --> 00:31:56,670
like girls need to fight girls and
guys need to fight guys. We like,

539
00:31:56,671 --> 00:31:59,100
we have different strengths than the
guys do and the guys have different

540
00:31:59,101 --> 00:32:00,420
strengths in the girls do and,

541
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:04,920
and it's nice for us to have a place
so that we can showcase our skills.

542
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:06,370
Yes,
I agree.

543
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:11,910
I think the only problem that I have
with that transitioning thing is physical

544
00:32:11,951 --> 00:32:13,090
competition.
That's it.

545
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:17,410
Physical competition against the gender
that you supposedly aligned with. Yeah.

546
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:21,790
Yeah. You can't do it, but here's what
you don't see. Here's what you don't see.

547
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:24,910
You don't see a lot of transgender
men who want to fight men.

548
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:28,890
You don't see a lot of women
who are taking hormones, uh,

549
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:33,190
to become a man who want to
fight men. Yeah. Good. Fucking
luck with that, ladies.

550
00:32:33,191 --> 00:32:35,770
Yeah, good luck. Stop. This is crazy.

551
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:40,130
Like this idea that you just magically
become a woman or you just magically

552
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:41,660
become a man.
It's just not true.

553
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:45,590
And athletes recognize it and
rational people recognize it,

554
00:32:45,591 --> 00:32:49,970
but there's so much pushback from
progressive people who it's like what

555
00:32:49,971 --> 00:32:52,700
percentage of the population and we
even talking about here and we as a,

556
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:56,190
it's not even 1% it's a very
strange thing that it's,

557
00:32:56,360 --> 00:33:00,820
it's taking over the conversation
with bathrooms and competition,

558
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:02,540
sports and so many different things.

559
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:06,830
I'm all for inclusiveness and I'm all
for being open minded and letting,

560
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:11,750
letting people do you whatever you want
to be yourself. Be Whatever yourself is.

561
00:33:11,751 --> 00:33:13,940
I don't know what yourself,
I don't know what you feel,

562
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:17,360
but you can't compete against
women. That's, it's that simple.

563
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:21,680
It's really that simple. It has, it
has to be something deeper where they,

564
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:25,940
you know, it and to me, I think
it goes back to like that mental,

565
00:33:25,941 --> 00:33:27,590
like a mental block where you,

566
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:32,060
where you need some like a false
sense of confidence. Yes. I feel like,

567
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:35,840
what's like sand bagging? It really is.
It really, it is the ultimate sandbag.

568
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:38,090
It's like, Oh, I'm a
woman. Like, wait a minute.

569
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,890
Where the fuck did you get those hands?

570
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:43,880
That's really like the ultimate
form of sex. I mean everybody,

571
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:46,250
for folks who don't know
what sandbagging is, oh,

572
00:33:46,251 --> 00:33:48,740
I was going to bring up smokers too.
For folks who don't know what smokers is.

573
00:33:48,741 --> 00:33:49,820
If you listen to this podcast,

574
00:33:49,821 --> 00:33:54,210
the smoker is small amateur fights that
they have in gyms or little arenas,

575
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:59,210
a high school gym, stuff like that.
But, um, uh, sandbagging is like,

576
00:33:59,211 --> 00:34:04,211
say if Michelle had a black belt in
Jujitsu and then entered into a judo

577
00:34:06,501 --> 00:34:10,780
tournament as a white belt and then
just fucking flying armbar everybody,

578
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:14,410
they'd be like, what the hell is this?
Where'd you get your white belts?

579
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:18,170
Like how do you have a white belt? But
we've all seen things like that before.

580
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:19,640
Everyone has seen things like that before.

581
00:34:19,641 --> 00:34:22,430
There's people that pretend they're
a younger than they really are.

582
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:24,260
They pretend they're lighter
than they really are.

583
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:28,550
They pretend they cause they want to win.
This is no different. It's no different.

584
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:31,730
It really is.
And the people who don't understand it,

585
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:35,870
they have never competed in high level
athletics. It's really that simple.

586
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:37,730
If you've competed in
high level athletics,

587
00:34:37,731 --> 00:34:39,470
you know that there's a differentiation.

588
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:41,720
There's a difference
between men and women.

589
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,930
And there's a reason why we have a
man's division in a women's division.

590
00:34:44,931 --> 00:34:46,550
It's not that anybody's better or worse,

591
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:51,060
it's just like there's unfair advantages
like the Bob Sapp mandatorial thing.

592
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,220
That was an unfair advantage.

593
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:57,250
It's just overcome by someone who
have superior skill and an iron will.

594
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,840
And that's what Minataro
was when he beat Bob Sapp.

595
00:34:59,970 --> 00:35:03,650
I mean there's no denying that one
guy was way bigger and way stronger,

596
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:07,640
but it was overcome. You shouldn't
force people to overcome. It should be,

597
00:35:07,641 --> 00:35:12,200
even if they were, even if Minataro and
Bob Sapp or even here's the fight, shoot,

598
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:15,230
take down, Dang on his back.
Armbar Bang fights over.

599
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:19,430
It'd be like a couple minutes
maximum admin Atar would armbar yeah.

600
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:25,010
What do you think it's because people
like to see the mismatch and maybe like

601
00:35:25,011 --> 00:35:30,010
that underdog story where the person
that is, you know, the underdog wins.

602
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:32,360
Yeah, like mandatory, but like again,

603
00:35:32,361 --> 00:35:35,410
minutes Harlow's neck is still
fucked up to this deck. You know,

604
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:38,070
his neck bothered him.
His entire, from that one

605
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:40,800
pile driver, three hours, 75 pounds,

606
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:45,540
plus his weight all on his neck. It just
shows you how fucking tough dot guy is.

607
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:48,450
You know, the [inaudible] story was
run over by a truck when he was a kid.

608
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:51,030
That's way as this giant scar on his back.

609
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:54,810
Like he was in the hospital for like a
year. He's at the Carson animal. I mean,

610
00:35:54,811 --> 00:35:56,150
he's as tough as they go.

611
00:35:56,220 --> 00:36:01,080
I got hit by a truck. You're not going
to do nothing to me. You can't force it,

612
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:03,370
everyone to be that tough.
You know?

613
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:08,500
I think it's important to have fairness
in this. This is why I'm so pro Usada.

614
00:36:08,501 --> 00:36:09,460
I love what they're doing.

615
00:36:09,461 --> 00:36:11,950
I love the fact that they're
testing the shit out of people.

616
00:36:11,951 --> 00:36:14,350
They're just showing up at people's
houses at six o'clock in the morning, hey,

617
00:36:14,351 --> 00:36:16,270
wake up time for a test.

618
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:21,100
And but is it the same
in, in every country? Um,

619
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,390
that's a good question. It's
a very good question. Right?

620
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:26,440
Someone's training in Russia
or Germany or wherever. Yeah,

621
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,700
that's a very good question.

622
00:36:27,701 --> 00:36:30,580
I do not know the answer to that
because I know that's kind of one of the

623
00:36:30,581 --> 00:36:32,680
concerns for some of
the athletes that yeah,

624
00:36:32,681 --> 00:36:35,500
it might be really strict
here in the states,

625
00:36:35,501 --> 00:36:38,410
but in other states or is it as strict?
Right.

626
00:36:38,411 --> 00:36:43,090
Because it is u s antidoping
agency that's Usada. Yeah,

627
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:47,230
that's a good question. Yeah. So what
do you think if you don't think it is,

628
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:51,040
I don't know. I'll talk for you. Is there
something fucked up you need to say,

629
00:36:51,041 --> 00:36:55,700
just go like this. I don't
know. Um, I guess I just, I,

630
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:59,840
I'm can only be concerned with what's
under my control and so then I'm just

631
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:03,340
going to train and I'm going to get as
good as I can get and hopefully, you know,

632
00:37:03,341 --> 00:37:07,670
you sought a can, can take
care of the rest. But for me
to stress about it is, is,

633
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:12,490
is just time wasted I think for
myself. Well, I do know of a case

634
00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:17,610
where there was a fighter who told me
that there was a guy who was openly dirty

635
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:23,710
as far as what everybody knew and he
knew that he was going to piss hot.

636
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:28,090
So he went and did some seminars in
another country and just stayed over in

637
00:37:28,091 --> 00:37:30,370
another country for just moved around.
It's like,

638
00:37:30,371 --> 00:37:33,370
so you see this world class fighter,
these weird little gyms. And I was like,

639
00:37:33,371 --> 00:37:37,840
what is going on over there?
And the gentleman who told
me said, listen man, he's,

640
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:41,590
he's dark and drug tests. That's what
he's doing over there. That's crazy. Yeah.

641
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:44,680
Hey look, for sure. Like when you,

642
00:37:44,681 --> 00:37:47,500
when the kind of like Tj Dillashaw
gets popped and you're like, wow,

643
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,110
TJ for a world title,

644
00:37:50,111 --> 00:37:53,680
he's getting bopped like how many
people are getting away with this?

645
00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:55,000
How many people got away with it?

646
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:59,380
It's just not worth it. He lost a
lot doing that. What? Yeah. Oh yeah.

647
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:01,720
Is that it's not worth it.
It's not worth it.

648
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:05,680
Ultimately it's definitely not worth
it cause its legacy is tainted.

649
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:08,500
But if he got away with it,
is it worth it? How many,

650
00:38:08,501 --> 00:38:12,940
how many people got away with it? Here's
the question. How many people retired?

651
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:16,720
And we never got to see
their drug tests from 2006,

652
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,360
2008 like what were you taken?

653
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:23,350
Are we on like back when they
used to have those silly wait, uh,

654
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:26,410
drug tests or their chest,
you at the weigh ins,

655
00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:29,020
which is basically the
intelligence test. Like, Hey,

656
00:38:29,021 --> 00:38:33,190
you still taken steroids or do
you stop a couple of weeks ago?

657
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:37,660
And the,
the today is so much more sophisticated.

658
00:38:37,661 --> 00:38:41,110
That's why people are getting popped
for EPO and a bunch of things that were

659
00:38:41,111 --> 00:38:44,280
hard to hard to find. Yeah.
They're the thresholds.

660
00:38:44,290 --> 00:38:47,860
Like this is the John Johnson
with the Pika grams, the,

661
00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:52,930
the t the insignificant amount in terms
of like the performance enhancing aspect

662
00:38:53,681 --> 00:38:57,160
of it that is in his system. Like
how can they detect that? Well,

663
00:38:57,161 --> 00:39:00,340
they can detect that because the
machines are way more sophisticated.

664
00:39:00,490 --> 00:39:03,310
The drug testings way.
Like he, if he had tested,

665
00:39:03,311 --> 00:39:07,960
if Jon Jones had tested two years
ago, he would have tested clean. Yeah.

666
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:11,980
But now it's just, they're just
way better to tie even something,

667
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:15,850
even if you're taking creatine and
that creatine is tainted. Yeah.

668
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:18,730
Which is a lot of what these guys,
Tim means that was his deal.

669
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:20,530
He was taking a supplement.
It was tainted.

670
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:24,580
Quite a few guys have legitimately just
taken over the counter supplements that

671
00:39:24,581 --> 00:39:29,500
they thought were clean and they got
something just some tiny free that doesn't

672
00:39:29,501 --> 00:39:32,580
have any effect on their performance,
but it shows up.

673
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:36,050
It'll show up for months and weeks.
And in John's case, like hears,

674
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:39,430
it's been showing up for like a year
and a half. It comes on and off. Yeah.

675
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:42,070
And when you're cutting weight,
that's when it seems to come back.

676
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:45,940
That's what it seems to show because
your body is gone, you're losing fat,

677
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,000
you're losing, you're losing body
weight and some of it's stored in fat.

678
00:39:49,001 --> 00:39:50,830
They think it's very confusing for them.

679
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:53,440
They're trying to figure it
all out and then the knee,

680
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:58,000
all these fucking people online or we
rant and rave at about Pika grams and this

681
00:39:58,001 --> 00:40:01,540
and I like the science experts and they
think it's the think it's all bullshit

682
00:40:01,541 --> 00:40:04,540
that John's allowed to fire. You should
be banned for life and like, yeah, okay,

683
00:40:04,541 --> 00:40:05,890
you don't,
you're not listening.

684
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:09,910
Like he tested negative and then he
tested positive a week later and then he

685
00:40:09,911 --> 00:40:12,370
tested negative a week after that.
Like what's happening here?

686
00:40:12,371 --> 00:40:16,140
Something weird is happening. Figuring
out for themselves. Exactly. Yeah.

687
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:20,200
But I'm glad they're figuring it out
because now people get to see like,

688
00:40:20,201 --> 00:40:20,531
hey look,

689
00:40:20,531 --> 00:40:24,910
Jon Jones was out for all that time for
other problems and then for the drug

690
00:40:24,911 --> 00:40:28,360
problems. Yeah. Like this is
a lot of money. That guy lost.

691
00:40:28,361 --> 00:40:31,180
John probably lost tens of
millions of dollars. Yeah.

692
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:34,600
You know, he's still young, he's still
young and he's still out, you know,

693
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:37,150
and hasn't hit his prime yet.
I don't think.

694
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:37,800
No.

695
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:42,800
I think also all that knowing that it
can all be taken away from you probably

696
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:48,120
met like tempered him,
like put him in a better place.

697
00:40:48,121 --> 00:40:52,710
We realize like I still have
this gift of incredible talent.

698
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:57,450
If he just a natural born fighter fishing,
he just knows how to fight. Some guys,

699
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:00,150
they have all the techniques,
all the talent,

700
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:03,360
but they don't know how to
put it together. Shawn knows
how to put it together.

701
00:41:03,730 --> 00:41:06,730
Yeah. He's just, he just,
that's his, that's his jam.

702
00:41:06,731 --> 00:41:08,080
He just goes out there and he can,

703
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:11,800
he just does things on the fly that nobody
would ever think of that works. Yeah.

704
00:41:11,830 --> 00:41:12,690
He tries things out.

705
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:17,410
It's crazy to watch him train cause he's
just super laser done and focused and

706
00:41:17,411 --> 00:41:19,330
there's nothing, you know, there could be,

707
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:21,910
the building could be getting
bombed and it wouldn't matter.

708
00:41:21,911 --> 00:41:25,070
He just beyond the bag working on
his technique. Yeah. It's really,

709
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,500
it's really cool to watch.
Well

710
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:31,520
he's, he's the outlier, right? I mean
there's a, there's special fighters.

711
00:41:31,521 --> 00:41:33,110
They're outliers in,

712
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:38,570
in the sport and for our era it was
like Anderson Silva, mighty mouse.

713
00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:42,710
Jon Jones. Yeah. Those are
the real outliers. Or are
you just watching me just go,

714
00:41:42,711 --> 00:41:46,190
Jesus Christ, like Anderson,
when he was in his prime,

715
00:41:46,191 --> 00:41:50,720
you would watch him and you would watch
them set guys up and it's, he just,

716
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:52,370
it's almost like he had cheat codes.

717
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,120
Like you could just see
what they were doing. Yeah.

718
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:58,070
We just like checks and you did that.
I did this and you do that. Okay,

719
00:41:58,071 --> 00:42:00,530
well I'm going to do this and I know
you're going to do that. And Pop.

720
00:42:00,531 --> 00:42:03,020
There it goes. Yeah. And he
would just figure you guys out.

721
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:05,640
It was wonderful to watch though because

722
00:42:06,010 --> 00:42:10,210
opened up, opened up like a
door for all of the rest of us.

723
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:13,930
I feel like with any good fighter,
when you watch them fight,

724
00:42:14,050 --> 00:42:18,310
it opens up a door in your own mind.
Like, oh, like that's possible.

725
00:42:18,311 --> 00:42:19,061
I can do that.

726
00:42:19,061 --> 00:42:23,890
And so I feel like with Anderson Silva
did that a lot with his movement,

727
00:42:23,891 --> 00:42:26,290
with this head movement,
with his variety of,

728
00:42:26,291 --> 00:42:30,940
of punches and kicks and the angles
at which they came in from, you know,

729
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,490
and I don't know,
I feel like Anderson Silva did.

730
00:42:33,491 --> 00:42:37,300
I feel like Rhonda did that with her
judo feel like Machita did that with his

731
00:42:37,301 --> 00:42:40,760
karate. Um, and then, you know, I,

732
00:42:40,770 --> 00:42:43,330
I can go down the list of everybody,

733
00:42:43,331 --> 00:42:47,800
but I feel like it kind of like goes
in cycles, you know? And um, I mean,

734
00:42:47,801 --> 00:42:50,920
it's great for me because I can watch
them and I can implement new things.

735
00:42:50,921 --> 00:42:55,921
I feel like that's why I've been able
to be in the game for so long and still

736
00:42:56,321 --> 00:43:00,850
continue to grow and evolve because I
get to watch other people and the things

737
00:43:00,851 --> 00:43:04,390
that they do and like add that to
my, to my tool lists, you know?

738
00:43:04,550 --> 00:43:08,450
Yeah. It changes the expectation of
what's possible. Right. I think it will.

739
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:09,141
The mighty mouse.

740
00:43:09,141 --> 00:43:12,080
That was one of the best examples of
that because when I would watch mighty

741
00:43:12,081 --> 00:43:16,030
mouse fight, I'd be like, show me
someone who's better, show me, show me.

742
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:17,900
Show me someone who's ever
been better than this guy.

743
00:43:17,990 --> 00:43:20,240
Like I've never seen anybody
move better than this guy.

744
00:43:20,270 --> 00:43:23,330
Like he doesn't get hit or if
he gets hit, he, it's rare.

745
00:43:23,331 --> 00:43:26,090
Like every three or four
fights on my catches him,

746
00:43:26,091 --> 00:43:29,660
like John Moraga caught him with a good
straight punch like that. That's like,

747
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:34,170
that was the last I remembered. I'd like
to see him run it back with pseudo oh,

748
00:43:34,390 --> 00:43:38,510
too close fight and very close fight.
And he kind of was so

749
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:41,840
it blew my mind how like
nonchalant he was about at all.

750
00:43:41,841 --> 00:43:43,760
Like at the end he's like, yeah, whatever.

751
00:43:44,690 --> 00:43:49,530
But that's him. Dj is just a special
guy and he's another one's like,

752
00:43:50,370 --> 00:43:54,570
couldn't be a nicer guy. Yeah. Like
if you didn't know that he was, uh,

753
00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:57,360
one of the best fighters that's
ever walked the face of the planet,

754
00:43:57,570 --> 00:44:01,380
you go along with this friendly guy,
he seems, he's so nice and normal.

755
00:44:01,381 --> 00:44:06,270
It talks like he's articulate. He
doesn't talk like a mean person is just,

756
00:44:06,330 --> 00:44:07,163
it's a great,

757
00:44:07,470 --> 00:44:12,470
it's a great example of like something
that's contrary to the stereotypes that

758
00:44:12,721 --> 00:44:15,330
people think of when they think
of cage fighters. Yeah. You know,

759
00:44:15,331 --> 00:44:19,260
someone is fighting, which is a weird
word, right? Like Kate, like do,

760
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:24,090
what do you think? Cage
fighting. You do that? Yeah.
Like you're a cage fighter. UFC.

761
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:26,790
Yeah. You do UFC. Yeah.

762
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:29,940
That's if you're fighting for Bella
to are people like, what's that?

763
00:44:29,941 --> 00:44:32,760
Is that like UFC? What is
that? What's Bella tour?

764
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:36,740
Yeah. Catch for changing though.
It's great. I love the competition.

765
00:44:36,741 --> 00:44:39,680
I think that's great that there's more
options out there for the fighters.

766
00:44:39,870 --> 00:44:42,750
Oh, for sure. Yeah. I think it's very
important. I think it's very important.

767
00:44:43,230 --> 00:44:46,320
What's interesting too about this sport
is that it's one of the only sports

768
00:44:46,321 --> 00:44:51,321
where you can go back from 1993 to 2019
and you could see massive evolution.

769
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:53,730
Yeah.
There's no other sport like that.

770
00:44:53,731 --> 00:44:57,390
If you go back and watch boxing from
93 you're watching great boxing,

771
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:58,740
worldclass boxing.

772
00:44:58,741 --> 00:45:02,910
Like you could take someone
from [inaudible] 93 and put
them into 2018 like they

773
00:45:02,911 --> 00:45:07,200
would fit perfect. Right.
Thanks. Roy Jones Jr shit,

774
00:45:07,650 --> 00:45:11,580
Rachel's genuine. He's in his prime
today. Everybody be fucked today.

775
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,640
They'd be fucked.
He was just something special.

776
00:45:15,690 --> 00:45:19,740
Bernard Hopkins boxing mentality is like
so old school when you got to stick to

777
00:45:19,741 --> 00:45:21,120
their traditions even it's,

778
00:45:21,150 --> 00:45:25,200
it's kind of like taboo to to see
like fighters switching stance,

779
00:45:25,201 --> 00:45:29,940
which some of them like the good ones
are Josh. Like my husband, he boxed,

780
00:45:29,941 --> 00:45:33,450
you know, and he has a lot, he had a lot
of old boxing coaches that were like,

781
00:45:33,451 --> 00:45:36,870
you don't switch stance. Like you stick
your stance and you perfect that stance,

782
00:45:36,871 --> 00:45:37,540
you know,

783
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:38,510
out of their fucking mind.

784
00:45:39,030 --> 00:45:41,620
You've watched Terrence Crawford this
one of the things he does so brilliantly.

785
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:42,330
Yeah.
He,

786
00:45:42,330 --> 00:45:46,870
he is as good as a southpaw as he is
orthodox and it's one of the reasons why

787
00:45:46,871 --> 00:45:48,550
it's so difficult to solve.
Yeah.

788
00:45:48,670 --> 00:45:51,850
Because if you think you got to read
on his timing and then all of a sudden

789
00:45:51,970 --> 00:45:55,300
you're looking gonna Right Jab instead
of a left jab now like, oh shit,

790
00:45:55,540 --> 00:45:56,500
maybe it's,
maybe it's just,

791
00:45:56,530 --> 00:46:00,850
did I watch MMA and more focused
on MMA than I am in boxing.

792
00:46:00,851 --> 00:46:04,780
But when I just from,
you know,

793
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:07,690
having my husband helped me
out and all this stuff, he,

794
00:46:07,691 --> 00:46:09,130
that's what he's saying
is going to be the,

795
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:13,750
like the biggest evolution or what has
started to evolve in boxing is that they

796
00:46:13,751 --> 00:46:15,280
are realizing,
okay,

797
00:46:15,281 --> 00:46:18,340
you can use both sides now and
that's going to trick them even more.

798
00:46:18,430 --> 00:46:20,290
Well,
Marvin Hagler was amazing at that.

799
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:23,920
It was one of Marvin hangers best skills
that he could fight southpaws as well

800
00:46:23,921 --> 00:46:24,401
as he could get fired.

801
00:46:24,401 --> 00:46:28,330
Orthodox Hagler was one of the greatest
fighters of all time, you know,

802
00:46:28,331 --> 00:46:32,370
and he was a champion in the 80s Oh,
okay. You don't know Marvin Hagler? No,

803
00:46:34,510 --> 00:46:37,000
I never already hottie you
don't know the marvelous one.

804
00:46:37,030 --> 00:46:42,010
I never even really watched boxing
until I met my husband. Really?

805
00:46:42,011 --> 00:46:45,920
Yeah. That's crazy. Well, he introduced
you to something awesome. Yeah. Yeah.

806
00:46:45,930 --> 00:46:49,690
It's a good time right now
to watch boxing. You know,
there's so many good boxers.

807
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:52,760
Yeah. Um, I think that's the,

808
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:56,130
one of the things that he wants
me to really work on in order to,

809
00:46:56,190 --> 00:47:00,140
to get my game to the next level is my
boxing. You know, cause my kicks are good.

810
00:47:00,230 --> 00:47:03,050
My wrestling's you know,
getting better at my Jujitsu is good.

811
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:07,370
And if as long if I can put together
my punches and we'll be a okay.

812
00:47:07,490 --> 00:47:08,540
Ready to get that belt.

813
00:47:09,950 --> 00:47:13,670
Karate is an interesting martial art too
that you are really good at because you

814
00:47:13,671 --> 00:47:14,504
have this,

815
00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:19,010
you have an excellent ability to use
that front leg that most people don't.

816
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:22,320
They don't have, like you have an
awesome front like sidekick, great fun,

817
00:47:22,321 --> 00:47:24,470
like roundhouse kick. And
when you do that, I see,

818
00:47:24,471 --> 00:47:26,390
I see that in your fight
sometimes people are like,

819
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:29,670
oh I've got to adjust to this.
Cause like a jab. Yeah. By,

820
00:47:29,671 --> 00:47:32,500
but a jab that could fuck you up.
I could shove that can knock you out.

821
00:47:33,070 --> 00:47:36,130
Yeah. I think I, I mean, I
guess like, Oh that to my,

822
00:47:36,170 --> 00:47:39,220
my point find days when
everybody was bigger than me,

823
00:47:39,221 --> 00:47:41,900
it didn't matter because
it was by, by belts. Right.

824
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:44,680
And so I was always a
smaller one and trying to,

825
00:47:44,830 --> 00:47:47,190
trying to get the point off
first I would just use my,

826
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:51,160
my front leg and kick it out there
as fast as I could. Um, but I do,

827
00:47:51,161 --> 00:47:55,810
I feel like my, my, my
kicks have lended to being,

828
00:47:56,080 --> 00:48:00,100
I've adopted them as
jobs, you know, so, yeah.

829
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:01,240
And I love it.

830
00:48:01,270 --> 00:48:04,600
I think it helps it because then it kind
of neutralizes the height difference.

831
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:08,370
Do you train a lot with
Winkeljohn? I do. Called John is a,

832
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:09,930
he was an excellent fighter,

833
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:14,180
a really good kickboxer and
really good at both styles too.

834
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:18,930
Like leg kick style, but also good at
like he had karate techniques as well. He,

835
00:48:18,931 --> 00:48:19,920
and he's also,

836
00:48:19,921 --> 00:48:23,820
he was very good at those transitions
between those straight kicks and punches.

837
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:25,490
Yeah. Well, you know,

838
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:30,390
that's the thing where a lot of people
get confused as like a a no man's land

839
00:48:30,391 --> 00:48:31,230
between kicking him,

840
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:35,340
punching with people were kicking
specialists and you see it like even with

841
00:48:35,341 --> 00:48:39,030
elite fighters like Raymond Daniels as
he's coming up in his kickboxing career,

842
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:43,710
it took a while before he could make that
smooth transition between kicking and

843
00:48:43,711 --> 00:48:48,711
punching because Raymond would be on the
outside and he was a world class top of

844
00:48:48,991 --> 00:48:51,140
the food chain karate point fighter.
Yeah.

845
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:54,720
And then got into kickboxing and
as long as he was at a distance,

846
00:48:54,930 --> 00:48:58,140
he was fucking people up.
But in the transition,

847
00:48:58,170 --> 00:49:01,740
the no man's land between the kicking
and the punching, he looked awkward.

848
00:49:01,770 --> 00:49:05,340
It took a while before he sorta,
so some guys like Joseph Vault,

849
00:49:05,341 --> 00:49:09,150
Eleni and Nikki hold skin.
They sort of exposed that the gap,

850
00:49:09,151 --> 00:49:12,870
the no man's land gap. That's a problem
with a lot of kickers have. Yeah.

851
00:49:12,890 --> 00:49:15,870
They have that problem with the gap
from the kicking to the punching.

852
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:20,110
Yeah, for sure. I think that's
one of the things that I had to,

853
00:49:20,111 --> 00:49:23,080
that was one of the things
that I had to really work on.

854
00:49:23,081 --> 00:49:28,081
And I think because I enjoy grappling
and Jujitsu that I went straight from

855
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:35,700
kicking to clench up grappling
and I kind of skipped the boxing,

856
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:42,370
the boxing part of it. How much boxing
you doing now? Um, quite a bit actually.

857
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:45,700
Is that your main focus? Yeah, yeah.
Especially off, you know, off camp.

858
00:49:45,701 --> 00:49:48,640
We don't have any, you
know, game plans to work on.

859
00:49:48,641 --> 00:49:50,620
We're working boxing and wrestling.

860
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:53,330
Now. When you say you work in
boxing, are you just sparring,

861
00:49:53,331 --> 00:49:54,680
boxing and hitting pads,

862
00:49:54,681 --> 00:49:59,681
boxing or are you trying to
implement that into MMA training?

863
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:00,733
Yeah,

864
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:06,380
um, I would say both were not sparring.
We're not spying right now. Boxing. Um,

865
00:50:06,470 --> 00:50:08,840
but I was working on your
hands working on the hands,

866
00:50:08,841 --> 00:50:12,380
working on the foot work and then,
so we'll just do strictly boxing,

867
00:50:12,890 --> 00:50:15,760
but then we'll do,
like you're saying the transitions,

868
00:50:15,761 --> 00:50:20,330
so kicks the boxing and boxing,
the kicks and then boxing to take downs.

869
00:50:21,030 --> 00:50:21,760
Yeah,

870
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:21,971
yeah.

871
00:50:21,971 --> 00:50:26,970
Having things to do when you don't have
to think by knowing exactly what to do.

872
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,510
I'm in this position, there goes
the knee, I'm in this position,

873
00:50:29,511 --> 00:50:34,010
now I'm throwing a punch.
When you see someone going,
oh, like I've gotta do this.

874
00:50:34,210 --> 00:50:38,150
I've got to think. Yeah. You know, the,
the, the, the, those transitions, it's,

875
00:50:38,190 --> 00:50:41,730
it's very, it's a, that
when you're in higher,

876
00:50:41,930 --> 00:50:43,250
higher pressure situations,

877
00:50:43,251 --> 00:50:46,490
that's when those transitions are the
most awkward when you don't have like a

878
00:50:46,491 --> 00:50:47,600
conditioned response.

879
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:48,180
Yeah.

880
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:53,030
And I think that's the biggest thing
that I've really been able to work on is

881
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:57,680
[inaudible] is the blending of all
of them. I feel like so much of us,

882
00:50:57,710 --> 00:50:58,640
so many of us,

883
00:50:59,150 --> 00:51:03,740
we train specific boxing's specific
MMA or kickboxing, Jujitsu,

884
00:51:03,741 --> 00:51:06,410
wrestling, whatever, but we
never really blend it together.

885
00:51:06,411 --> 00:51:08,190
And I think that's the
most important part.

886
00:51:08,490 --> 00:51:10,240
Well,
that's why with George was so great.

887
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:13,660
George St Pierre was so
amazing at transitions.

888
00:51:13,690 --> 00:51:17,350
Like you never knew what he was going
to do. Yeah. He was so unpredictable.

889
00:51:17,351 --> 00:51:18,820
He was going to punch you or
he's going to take you down.

890
00:51:18,821 --> 00:51:23,020
So everyone's worried about everything.
You didn't know what was coming. Yeah.

891
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:25,240
That's why I always encourage fighters.

892
00:51:25,241 --> 00:51:29,830
Like even if you're really good striker
man, you got to attempt take downs.

893
00:51:29,831 --> 00:51:32,230
You've got to keep people honest because
otherwise people are just going to

894
00:51:32,231 --> 00:51:35,450
settle in and never worry
about your takedowns.

895
00:51:35,470 --> 00:51:39,160
And then they have an extra degree of
comfort with their striking and you can

896
00:51:39,161 --> 00:51:41,500
get caught what stuff you wouldn't
get caught with otherwise.

897
00:51:41,630 --> 00:51:42,463
Yeah.
And there's just,

898
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:47,240
I just feel like in MMA you
have so many opportunities.

899
00:51:47,241 --> 00:51:50,720
Like why would you limit yourself
those opportunities? Yeah.

900
00:51:50,990 --> 00:51:52,850
I remember one of my fights,
um,

901
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:59,450
I was fighting this girl who
was like a 10 time boxer in MMA.

902
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:02,450
And so I'm like, oh, this
girl is coming into my world.

903
00:52:02,451 --> 00:52:04,610
I'm going to show her what's up.
But then,

904
00:52:04,790 --> 00:52:07,880
and I was beating her the whole
first round, kicking her out,

905
00:52:07,990 --> 00:52:09,950
keeping out with kicks,
keeping out with punches.

906
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:14,340
I remember going back to my corner and
saying, man, this is too easy. Like, um,

907
00:52:14,490 --> 00:52:18,920
you know, I'm piecing this girl up and
just, just me saying that to myself.

908
00:52:18,950 --> 00:52:22,220
I think something in my
head switch. But, um,

909
00:52:22,550 --> 00:52:24,200
I went back out and ended up,

910
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:30,440
I think what happened was I told myself,
okay,

911
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:32,720
your piece in our up with what,
you know,

912
00:52:32,721 --> 00:52:36,180
go out there and beat her at her own game.
Oh Jesus.

913
00:52:38,430 --> 00:52:41,960
Talk to your corner Bro. I told my,
I think it was just like a mental,

914
00:52:41,961 --> 00:52:44,120
like this is too easy.
I'm going to make it challenging,

915
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:47,720
more challenging on myself. I didn't
tell my corner that it was just like,

916
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:51,980
you know how sometimes when you're in a
fight you have like a million thoughts

917
00:52:51,981 --> 00:52:55,210
that go through your mind in a split
second. And I think that was one of them.

918
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:58,280
One of them, oh show this bitch
what's up? Yeah. And at her own game,

919
00:52:58,580 --> 00:53:00,320
which is stupid cause it's MMA.

920
00:53:00,321 --> 00:53:02,570
So I stood in front of her and
then she cracked me and then,

921
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:06,620
and I saw stars and I stood in front of
her and I didn't take her down and I was

922
00:53:06,621 --> 00:53:10,790
trying to, you know, exchange with her
and she cracked to me again and you know,

923
00:53:10,791 --> 00:53:13,010
I was waiting for her to
stop so it could be my turn

924
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:18,760
and she never stopped and the,

925
00:53:19,090 --> 00:53:23,510
and I got Tkos you know, but
um, I mean lesson learned,

926
00:53:23,511 --> 00:53:26,700
but I was just so stubborn in,
you know,

927
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:30,000
in my thoughts that I was like,
I'm going to beat her own game.

928
00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:31,170
What are you talking about?

929
00:53:31,171 --> 00:53:35,130
You're fighting MMA was so mad
at myself after the fact because,

930
00:53:35,850 --> 00:53:40,410
um, I just, I beat myself. I just beat
myself when I went back out there.

931
00:53:40,510 --> 00:53:42,430
Well, that's that old. How did you win?

932
00:53:42,431 --> 00:53:46,330
Or you learn and you obviously this is
something that's still in your mind to

933
00:53:46,331 --> 00:53:47,590
this day. You learned. Yeah.

934
00:53:47,620 --> 00:53:52,620
But that's a part of what makes a champion
like that desire to show I can beat

935
00:53:53,351 --> 00:53:56,380
you anywhere. Yeah. That crazy
belief in yourself. Like,

936
00:53:56,410 --> 00:53:57,920
Oh fuck this bitch up standards

937
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:04,480
high that those thought processes are so
crazy because the reason why you get so

938
00:54:04,481 --> 00:54:07,660
good in the first place is because you
love challenges and you want to do this

939
00:54:07,661 --> 00:54:11,020
difficult thing. Yeah. So you
literally made it more difficult.

940
00:54:11,570 --> 00:54:14,390
Yeah.
I don't know why I would do that,

941
00:54:14,391 --> 00:54:18,620
but that is exactly why I
continue to fight now. You know,

942
00:54:18,730 --> 00:54:23,730
I think I was nervous coming into the UFC
cause I was coming up from one oh five

943
00:54:24,410 --> 00:54:27,410
you know, I talking to my husband
and saying like, what are we doing?

944
00:54:27,411 --> 00:54:31,040
Like do you think I can make the jump
up and still hang with these girls? And

945
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:34,280
what would you be fighting in one
oh five the UFC had a one oh five.

946
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:39,290
Um, I dunno, I guess it just, uh, it,

947
00:54:39,580 --> 00:54:42,690
it would depend. I think it
would have to be worth it. Um,

948
00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:44,940
actually didn't make the cut.
Yeah.

949
00:54:44,941 --> 00:54:49,170
I feel like my last couple of cuts at
one oh five are pretty brutal. Like, um,

950
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:54,320
[inaudible] fallen out.
Your eyelashes or, yeah,

951
00:54:54,330 --> 00:54:57,600
like I was so shy, jaded
that my like my, you know,

952
00:54:57,601 --> 00:55:01,320
how your eyes sinking and I like,
I remember wiping,

953
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:06,180
wiping my eye and just looking down and
like a whole row of eyelashes or like on

954
00:55:06,181 --> 00:55:10,910
my, um, on my arm. And um, that's
like when people get syphilis. Oh,

955
00:55:11,390 --> 00:55:16,260
I don't want to die. Start falling
out. I was sickly for Shirley. Wow. Um,

956
00:55:16,290 --> 00:55:17,760
the, you know, they check your,

957
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:21,230
check your vitals after weigh ins and
the doctor when it released me because he

958
00:55:21,231 --> 00:55:24,870
couldn't find my heartbeat, like
my, my heartbeat for like an hour.

959
00:55:25,570 --> 00:55:30,480
Couldn't find your heart because
you're so dehydrated. Yeah. Whoa.

960
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:32,010
So,
um,

961
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:36,870
I just think that also that last cut was,
it was like a,

962
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:42,500
I did it too quickly. I
think I walk around that, um,

963
00:55:43,650 --> 00:55:46,330
like one 30 to one 30 for sure.

964
00:55:46,420 --> 00:55:50,230
And when you make the cut done with
one 15, how slowly do you do it?

965
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:54,700
I usually have that eight week
fight camp and as I do like pound,

966
00:55:54,820 --> 00:55:56,680
pound and a half,
two pounds a week.

967
00:55:57,020 --> 00:56:00,410
Yeah. So for you to get to one oh
five. Yeah. Don't do that. That sounds,

968
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:01,280
that sounds crazy.

969
00:56:01,580 --> 00:56:04,340
Back when the last time I fought
at one oh five I was probably,

970
00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:07,640
when I was fighting at one of,
I was probably walking around at like 25

971
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:09,230
mm still.

972
00:56:09,820 --> 00:56:13,850
That's 20 pounds of weight
for a hundred pound person.

973
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:16,630
That is 20% of your body weight.
Yeah.

974
00:56:16,670 --> 00:56:18,920
That's a significant amount
of drain yourself. I mean,

975
00:56:18,921 --> 00:56:21,650
if you think about a welterweight,
losing 20 pounds, it's a good cut.

976
00:56:22,190 --> 00:56:23,840
But an Adam person,

977
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:25,480
that's so much weight.

978
00:56:25,550 --> 00:56:27,710
I know. I feel, I feel
so much healthier now.

979
00:56:27,711 --> 00:56:32,711
I feel like when I'm in Camp I can focus
on training and having good energy,

980
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:34,610
you know,

981
00:56:34,610 --> 00:56:39,230
going at 100% rather than going 70%
and then go on to do more cardio.

982
00:56:39,770 --> 00:56:42,110
So I absolutely feel like more healthier.

983
00:56:42,111 --> 00:56:43,790
I feel like I've been
able to put muscle on,

984
00:56:43,791 --> 00:56:48,680
I feel like I'm stronger and just happier,
happier training.

985
00:56:49,030 --> 00:56:50,890
Yeah. What you're seeing
there from so many fighters?

986
00:56:50,891 --> 00:56:54,400
Somewhat and that's one of the reasons
why to go back to this one FC thing,

987
00:56:54,670 --> 00:56:57,550
I love what they're doing that they've
eliminated weight cutting. Yeah,

988
00:56:57,610 --> 00:57:00,400
they do hydration tests on people and
make sure you're not cutting any weight.

989
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:05,230
And I think the UFC is missing the boat.
They want to test for steroids,

990
00:57:05,231 --> 00:57:08,260
which is fantastic.
100% I'd support that.

991
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:12,910
They should test hydration to this
weight cutting weight cutting is nothing,

992
00:57:12,911 --> 00:57:16,120
but it's just sanctioned cheating.
That's all it is.

993
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:19,300
You're not 115 pounds.
Right?

994
00:57:19,301 --> 00:57:22,270
But everybody is going to cut down to
one 15 and then you're probably going to

995
00:57:22,271 --> 00:57:25,690
go back up to like what do you, when
you fight, when you get into the cage,

996
00:57:25,691 --> 00:57:29,560
what do you think you weigh this last
time I got back up to one 28 yeah.

997
00:57:29,590 --> 00:57:32,980
See that's what you're really way like
why is everybody saying she's fighting at

998
00:57:32,981 --> 00:57:36,760
one 15 this is not fighting at one 15
like when you see Tyron Woodley fights at

999
00:57:36,761 --> 00:57:41,580
one 70 no he doesn't. No, he weighs
one 70 you know Kamara Uzman.

1000
00:57:41,590 --> 00:57:44,310
He's not one 73 ways.

1001
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:47,680
One 74 a very small time.

1002
00:57:47,870 --> 00:57:48,703
What?

1003
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:53,810
Maybe it's just kind of like the
old school mentality or just the,

1004
00:57:54,350 --> 00:57:59,350
the idea of that being the last challenge
that you go through before you step

1005
00:57:59,841 --> 00:58:04,070
into the octagon. That I enjoy and
not that I enjoy it, but again,

1006
00:58:04,430 --> 00:58:07,880
going back to challenges and it's like
one of those things like, all right, like,

1007
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:10,880
you know,
take yourself to this point.

1008
00:58:11,210 --> 00:58:13,400
And if you can get through
that without breaking,

1009
00:58:13,430 --> 00:58:16,730
then me and you can go to
battle. Right. I don't know.

1010
00:58:16,731 --> 00:58:18,950
There's just something to that for me.

1011
00:58:19,540 --> 00:58:23,110
I see what you're saying. So it's
another challenge. Like you have a whole,

1012
00:58:23,140 --> 00:58:25,300
there's a series of
challenges. Yeah. The training,

1013
00:58:25,570 --> 00:58:27,910
there's the mental preparation
and there's a weight cut.

1014
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:29,620
All these things are together

1015
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:33,650
and, and I feel like that's like
the last step. It's like, you know,

1016
00:58:34,550 --> 00:58:36,080
it's a battle within yourself.

1017
00:58:36,350 --> 00:58:39,640
Is that the death star on your
forearm? What is that? This is,

1018
00:58:40,580 --> 00:58:43,490
it looks like the death star from a
distance. Let's try to figure it out.

1019
00:58:43,870 --> 00:58:48,100
It's an actual, uh,
silhouette on my husband. Oh,

1020
00:58:48,110 --> 00:58:51,500
that's so cool. So it's a
circular silhouette with
the mountains and the trees.

1021
00:58:51,530 --> 00:58:55,130
Oh, that's awesome. Yeah, that's really
cool. That's very unique. Thank you.

1022
00:58:55,510 --> 00:58:58,850
Does kinda look like the death star
though? From a distance? I was like Shit,

1023
00:58:58,930 --> 00:58:59,960
a fucking star wars game.

1024
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:06,710
Actually I don't remember the last time
I seen star wars, but yeah. So the,

1025
00:59:06,740 --> 00:59:09,470
the way cut though, the only problem
with it is it's bad for you. Yeah.

1026
00:59:09,471 --> 00:59:10,550
I mean I understand that.

1027
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:15,080
I don't cut much. I'd probably cut four
pounds of water weight. Oh that's great.

1028
00:59:15,081 --> 00:59:17,250
I hit when I like when
I show up fight week,

1029
00:59:17,251 --> 00:59:19,560
I'm probably like three like
four or five pounds off.

1030
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:19,941
Right.

1031
00:59:19,941 --> 00:59:24,941
But if you just ate normal we wouldn't
you be healthier give if instead of

1032
00:59:25,851 --> 00:59:28,880
getting down within four
pounds of the weight, like,

1033
00:59:28,881 --> 00:59:32,210
cause you're going to go up to one
28 the day fight. Right. So that's,

1034
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:34,580
that's an additional 13 pounds.
Where's that coming from?

1035
00:59:34,850 --> 00:59:37,260
It's come from somewhere. Right.
So you're doing something.

1036
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:41,880
I understand that the thought process
about talking to one of the doctors about

1037
00:59:41,881 --> 00:59:42,020
it.

1038
00:59:42,020 --> 00:59:45,200
My last fight cause he was like so strange
that you go through all of this just

1039
00:59:45,201 --> 00:59:48,830
to be the same way the next day.
I know doctors are so smart.

1040
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:52,700
I just looked at him like that is strange.

1041
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:57,200
It's fucking stupid is what it
is really is for for the sport.

1042
00:59:57,590 --> 00:59:58,640
Not you personally,

1043
00:59:58,641 --> 01:00:01,160
but it's what you have to do is
you want to compete in the sport.

1044
01:00:01,430 --> 01:00:03,380
I guess just because I've
been doing it for so long,

1045
01:00:03,381 --> 01:00:05,630
it's just this in in my head
it's like you know they're only,

1046
01:00:05,631 --> 01:00:08,300
a couple of things you have to do as a
fighter. Cutting weight is one of them.

1047
01:00:08,301 --> 01:00:13,020
If you can't do that, then you
know it is hard. I feel it.

1048
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:17,720
It's a process that you have to go through
and you have to be mentally prepared

1049
01:00:17,750 --> 01:00:20,630
to go through it and if you do it right,

1050
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:25,910
it should only be water that you're
cutting. Even though that's silly to do.

1051
01:00:25,911 --> 01:00:28,790
I don't know how it's, it's
silly to do. It's not good.

1052
01:00:28,820 --> 01:00:32,210
It's never good to just cut that water.
It's just not, it's not good for you.

1053
01:00:32,690 --> 01:00:35,300
But if you do it,
if you,

1054
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:38,090
if you do it intelligently where
you're not cutting too much weight,

1055
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:42,390
it's not that bad. But so many people
are doing these brutal 30 pound wakids.

1056
01:00:42,460 --> 01:00:46,910
I just, I feel like at that point it's,
it's not a benefit for you. Like some,

1057
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:49,640
for some people they are the
bigger person coming into the,

1058
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:51,110
to the octagon the next day.

1059
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:56,210
But you're going to reach a certain point
where cutting weight is not a benefit

1060
01:00:56,211 --> 01:01:00,770
for you. Maybe, you know, that's, if
you can do it and you pull it off,

1061
01:01:00,771 --> 01:01:04,340
especially if you're young and you
figure out how to do it correctly and

1062
01:01:04,341 --> 01:01:07,580
replenish your electrolytes, you
know, it is an advantage to be bigger.

1063
01:01:08,090 --> 01:01:11,360
But the reality is you're with
whatever weight class that is,

1064
01:01:11,361 --> 01:01:15,290
that's not what your way, you don't really
weigh that much. Your weight. It's like,

1065
01:01:15,291 --> 01:01:19,110
it's crazy. Like you should be, it
should be about skill versus skill,

1066
01:01:19,130 --> 01:01:22,970
but it shouldn't be about who's
got the best scientists. So,

1067
01:01:23,950 --> 01:01:24,201
I mean,

1068
01:01:24,201 --> 01:01:28,330
so what do you think you think in drag
would still be a one 15 or no chance?

1069
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:33,440
No chance. No, no, no, no.

1070
01:01:33,441 --> 01:01:35,600
She's bigger too.
She fucking struggles.

1071
01:01:36,020 --> 01:01:40,390
She struggles for one 15 but then
you've got Valentina. I was like,

1072
01:01:41,090 --> 01:01:44,300
I think that way class,
it's really interesting,

1073
01:01:44,420 --> 01:01:46,940
right when you're talking
about weight classes,

1074
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:51,530
if you're talking about the difference
between 105 pounds in 115 pounds,

1075
01:01:51,560 --> 01:01:54,530
it might only be 10 pounds, but it's a
giant percentage of your body weight.

1076
01:01:55,550 --> 01:01:59,750
And then you look at MMA in the men's
division and you have, you know,

1077
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:03,830
one 55 and you have one 70 you have
that 15 pound gap. That's a big gap.

1078
01:02:04,130 --> 01:02:07,790
It's a giant gap.
I think there should be every 10 pounds,

1079
01:02:07,970 --> 01:02:09,620
every 10 pounds for men and for women.

1080
01:02:09,770 --> 01:02:11,990
I think there's a real good argument
that should be every five pounds.

1081
01:02:12,180 --> 01:02:13,220
But if Dana heard this,

1082
01:02:13,940 --> 01:02:17,420
he would find whatever Harris has got
left to pluck them out of. He said,

1083
01:02:17,590 --> 01:02:20,520
John Logan to shut the fuck up.
Plucking his eyebrow

1084
01:02:20,550 --> 01:02:20,920
hairs.

1085
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:24,270
He doesn't even like the idea of a one
65 I'm like God damn that's a no brainer.

1086
01:02:24,870 --> 01:02:29,130
Yeah there is. There's plenty of fighters
out there that are willing to to,

1087
01:02:29,210 --> 01:02:31,820
to fight and just give him a place to do.
So in

1088
01:02:32,100 --> 01:02:33,840
and guys who would be
champions cause that's there.

1089
01:02:33,990 --> 01:02:36,300
They're real natural
weight close betweens.

1090
01:02:36,510 --> 01:02:40,320
I think the what one FC is doing in terms
of weight cutting is the way to do it.

1091
01:02:40,620 --> 01:02:44,280
But the other side is they're not doing
the same thing that you saw is doing in

1092
01:02:44,281 --> 01:02:45,120
terms of steroids.

1093
01:02:45,150 --> 01:02:49,530
So they are able to take a hundred
percent hundred percent talk to guys who

1094
01:02:49,531 --> 01:02:53,730
compete over there. And it's like,
yeah, I mean there's some, some testing.

1095
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:56,880
So would you rather fight somebody that's
heavier than you or somebody that's

1096
01:02:57,320 --> 01:02:59,040
taking question?
Very good question.

1097
01:02:59,430 --> 01:03:02,820
Because if there were not just
taking steroids but also taking EPO,

1098
01:03:03,090 --> 01:03:04,980
there's a lot of different
shit that people can take,

1099
01:03:04,981 --> 01:03:09,981
you know that can give you more like EPO
is a scary one because the person has

1100
01:03:10,501 --> 01:03:14,430
more gas in their tank to beat you.
Yeah. They have more, they can hit you,

1101
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:16,710
they can take shots better,
they can recover better,

1102
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:18,660
and then they can come
after you and then they,

1103
01:03:18,661 --> 01:03:21,480
they'll have more gas in the tank,
then maybe they can put you away.

1104
01:03:21,930 --> 01:03:25,500
Where did we meet somebody that's
heavier than me and depleted from cutting

1105
01:03:25,530 --> 01:03:29,280
water weight than somebody that was
taken steroids or equals for sure

1106
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:33,880
for a woman. I think for sure. For sure.
I think there's, for women, for women,

1107
01:03:33,881 --> 01:03:37,510
there's a real argument that once someone
has ever taken steroids that you've

1108
01:03:37,511 --> 01:03:41,710
altered your chemistry enough and your
physiology enough that you're forever

1109
01:03:41,711 --> 01:03:43,540
going to have some sort of an advantage.

1110
01:03:43,690 --> 01:03:46,270
So then there's nothing you
can do about that. Well,

1111
01:03:46,330 --> 01:03:49,390
I mean maybe deduct a point before you
even get in the octagon that's not even

1112
01:03:49,391 --> 01:03:51,950
good enough. Somebody chaos people.
Right? Yeah, that's true. Yeah.

1113
01:03:52,540 --> 01:03:54,680
How often do you spar?
Um,

1114
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:59,660
I would say heavy sparring once
a week, once a week. Like, um,

1115
01:03:59,730 --> 01:04:02,880
so we do,
uh,

1116
01:04:04,770 --> 01:04:09,150
like Emma make grappling on Mondays.
Tuesdays is a heavy sparring.

1117
01:04:09,151 --> 01:04:12,630
It's the 16 ounce.
Let's throw down spiring.

1118
01:04:13,020 --> 01:04:14,400
Wednesdays is wrestling,

1119
01:04:14,700 --> 01:04:19,170
Thursdays is MMA gloves.
Barring.

1120
01:04:19,171 --> 01:04:22,980
So it's kind of more just, um, accuracy,

1121
01:04:23,100 --> 01:04:24,180
like light on the striking,

1122
01:04:24,181 --> 01:04:29,181
heavy on the grappling and then
Fridays technical work technique stuff.

1123
01:04:29,491 --> 01:04:29,820
Like

1124
01:04:29,820 --> 01:04:32,430
now you're at a gym,
you're at Jackson Winklejohn,

1125
01:04:32,431 --> 01:04:35,520
which is one of the best gyms on
the planet earth, but also a gym.

1126
01:04:35,521 --> 01:04:38,850
It's filled with savages. I mean, yeah,

1127
01:04:39,150 --> 01:04:43,380
there must be a lot of chest bumping and
a lot of people that are trying to test

1128
01:04:43,381 --> 01:04:44,270
people and yeah,

1129
01:04:44,340 --> 01:04:49,050
there's got to be girls who were there
who look at a girl like you is, hey,

1130
01:04:49,051 --> 01:04:50,520
this girl's where I want to be.
Yeah.

1131
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:54,270
And I mean I've talked to males
who trained their say, man,

1132
01:04:54,271 --> 01:04:55,104
let me tell you something.

1133
01:04:55,170 --> 01:04:58,590
There's some Russian cats just show up
out of nowhere and tried to take your

1134
01:04:58,591 --> 01:05:00,690
head off. Yeah. Yeah.

1135
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:03,280
And they go outside and smoke
cigarettes and drink some vodka.

1136
01:05:04,210 --> 01:05:08,450
Are they smoking cigarettes? Um, some of
them we, that's weird. Fighters are crazy.

1137
01:05:08,451 --> 01:05:12,470
You get the funniest, coolest stories from
meeting fighters all around the world.

1138
01:05:13,130 --> 01:05:17,030
Yeah. Jackson's is, is, um,
it's a shark tank. Like,

1139
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:18,970
you're not going there to find emo,
you know,

1140
01:05:21,180 --> 01:05:24,190
you find a job. Yes, exactly.
So you've got to give it,

1141
01:05:24,490 --> 01:05:29,170
you have to have a good set of skills
before you get there in order to kind of

1142
01:05:29,171 --> 01:05:32,350
hold your own right. But we do
actually have an amateur, um,

1143
01:05:33,250 --> 01:05:38,250
team right now that is run by Jove is
senior and he's done an amazing job with

1144
01:05:38,741 --> 01:05:40,820
the amateur team. And so, um,

1145
01:05:40,990 --> 01:05:45,990
we've kind of been able to separate
the classes in that sense where Joey,

1146
01:05:46,740 --> 01:05:50,410
um, is kind of overseeing all of the
amateur fighters and he's building these

1147
01:05:50,411 --> 01:05:51,221
amateur fighters.

1148
01:05:51,221 --> 01:05:55,120
And when he feels like they're ready
to come and train with the proles,

1149
01:05:55,180 --> 01:05:58,990
he'll give them the goal, you know,
or, or do a trial run where they,

1150
01:05:59,050 --> 01:06:02,890
where they train with us for one week and
see if they're ready. And, um, you know,

1151
01:06:02,891 --> 01:06:06,040
for a higher level of the competition.
And then if they are, then they stay.

1152
01:06:06,041 --> 01:06:09,150
And if they're not that, they come
back to the amateur team and, and it's,

1153
01:06:09,151 --> 01:06:10,990
it's actually worked out quite well.

1154
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:14,900
Oh, that's great. So did they start
people from fresh, like no skills at all?

1155
01:06:14,950 --> 01:06:18,110
Some so you, cause there's
classes there for total beginners.

1156
01:06:18,540 --> 01:06:22,780
Uh, yeah. It's crazy if you ever
like go into Jim and see like, um,

1157
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:24,181
when you,

1158
01:06:24,181 --> 01:06:29,181
when you see like amateurs or people
that have like zero training spar versus

1159
01:06:29,700 --> 01:06:32,760
like professional fighters
spot. Yeah. It's crazy.

1160
01:06:32,761 --> 01:06:34,500
It's almost looks more dangerous.

1161
01:06:35,790 --> 01:06:39,390
I would not want to be in that w in like
the cage with some of those people that

1162
01:06:39,391 --> 01:06:42,660
like, because you just don't know where
the punches or kicks are coming from.

1163
01:06:42,661 --> 01:06:46,740
They're all coming full blast.
Exactly. 100% control. Yeah.

1164
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:50,360
Jujitsu. Jujitsu is the
same thing. You don't want,

1165
01:06:50,390 --> 01:06:54,800
the last thing you want to do is grapple
with a really strong guy was about to

1166
01:06:54,801 --> 01:06:56,090
get his blue belt.
Yeah.

1167
01:06:56,870 --> 01:07:01,040
Oh Geez. Yeah. Just he goes, gets
in, you know, gets in the way.

1168
01:07:01,041 --> 01:07:03,620
I think that's why they match up
high level with low level, don't you?

1169
01:07:03,990 --> 01:07:07,480
Sure. So someone can control
you and calm me down and

1170
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:12,900
yeah, I love Jujitsu. I can't wait to,
you know, to get my black belt in Jujitsu.

1171
01:07:12,901 --> 01:07:13,734
And,
uh,

1172
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:18,390
I think it's kind of brought me back to
my more traditional background where,

1173
01:07:18,450 --> 01:07:22,500
you know, there's a little
bit more structure when you
come, come, come to that.

1174
01:07:23,270 --> 01:07:24,103
Yeah.

1175
01:07:25,110 --> 01:07:29,460
Yeah. Now how much of that do
you, do you use a lot of grips?

1176
01:07:29,490 --> 01:07:31,770
Like do you grab collars
and sleeves and things? Like

1177
01:07:32,090 --> 01:07:36,830
I try, I try to force myself outside of
my comfort zone because I am so used to

1178
01:07:36,831 --> 01:07:40,580
grabbing wrists,
grabbing shoulders and you know,

1179
01:07:40,700 --> 01:07:43,010
right at the crick of the
elbows and stuff like that.

1180
01:07:43,011 --> 01:07:47,930
And I find myself going for those grips
because that's just what I've done for

1181
01:07:48,020 --> 01:07:48,950
the last decade.

1182
01:07:48,980 --> 01:07:53,180
But because I am stepping
into their world,

1183
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:56,870
I want to learn, I want to learn the grips
and I want to learn all of that stuff.

1184
01:07:57,080 --> 01:08:01,040
Um, yeah, it's, I mean, it's great if
you want to compete in Jujitsu with a g,

1185
01:08:01,580 --> 01:08:02,660
but I think for MMA,

1186
01:08:03,890 --> 01:08:08,890
I think the best benefit of Jujitsu
with the g for MMA is defensive for

1187
01:08:11,601 --> 01:08:14,240
submissions because you get caught
and things you can't power out of them

1188
01:08:14,250 --> 01:08:15,530
because it's not slippery.

1189
01:08:15,610 --> 01:08:17,650
Uh Huh. And I'm, I'm slippery. Like I've,

1190
01:08:18,970 --> 01:08:23,230
I love Nogi because I can slip out of
things and I'll just wait until I have a

1191
01:08:23,231 --> 01:08:26,100
little bit of space and then I'm
all out. Yeah. I'm just glad. Yeah.

1192
01:08:26,110 --> 01:08:28,660
And I'm just out, but I
can't do that in game. Yeah.

1193
01:08:28,900 --> 01:08:32,470
So what I'll do a lot of times is I'll
go train g and I'll do the technique

1194
01:08:32,471 --> 01:08:36,040
class and then when it's time to go,
like do live rolling,

1195
01:08:36,070 --> 01:08:38,620
I just take my key off and I go,
Gnocchi.

1196
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:42,420
That's smart. So that way everything
you're doing is applicable in MMA.

1197
01:08:42,421 --> 01:08:45,650
Because one of the things we used
to see in the early days of MMA CDs,

1198
01:08:45,690 --> 01:08:48,570
g world champions,
like elite level world champions,

1199
01:08:48,900 --> 01:08:53,900
and they'd fight in MMA and they lost
all of their technique because everything

1200
01:08:54,451 --> 01:08:59,340
was collars and sleeves and pants
and everything was grabbing things.

1201
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:01,470
Whereas instead of now
they try to go to cable,

1202
01:09:01,471 --> 01:09:03,960
grabs her over hooks and under
hooks and they were all confused.

1203
01:09:04,210 --> 01:09:05,940
We liked their technique is off.
Yeah.

1204
01:09:05,941 --> 01:09:09,540
And they would be like a blue belt
or a purple belt world champions.

1205
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:14,280
Yeah. I think it's great. Like my
professor now. Um, he, so I'll,

1206
01:09:14,340 --> 01:09:17,850
I'll be rolling with his, with his
wife or some of his students. And

1207
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:22,680
he like, it's weird because they're
getting me ready for my fights,

1208
01:09:22,681 --> 01:09:25,110
but I'm also getting them ready
for worlds and stuff like that.

1209
01:09:25,111 --> 01:09:28,710
So depending on who's getting cool ready
is what he'll call out if we're going.

1210
01:09:29,340 --> 01:09:33,190
And, um, you know, there's,
I'm sitting in their guard, um,

1211
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:36,270
he'll tell them that they have to
get active. They're like, he'll,

1212
01:09:36,300 --> 01:09:39,390
he'll straight up say if she was fighting,
you should just be punching the face.

1213
01:09:39,391 --> 01:09:41,130
You got to move, you've got
to do something, you know.

1214
01:09:41,131 --> 01:09:45,060
So I think it's good just to give
them a different perspective as well.

1215
01:09:45,180 --> 01:09:49,410
Have you ever watched combat
Jujitsu? Uh, I've seen a couple.

1216
01:09:49,411 --> 01:09:52,110
But where do you get to slap them in
the face and stuff like that? Yeah,

1217
01:09:52,111 --> 01:09:53,020
I've seen some of it.
Yeah.

1218
01:09:53,110 --> 01:09:57,430
That's interesting because it shows you
where there are these gaps will, okay,

1219
01:09:57,460 --> 01:10:01,480
this is an MMA. But if it was, yeah,
you'd be getting pounded out right here.

1220
01:10:01,810 --> 01:10:05,850
You can't just hang out. Like there's
moments in Jujitsu that are unrealistic.

1221
01:10:05,860 --> 01:10:08,710
And self defense situations.
We're in a fight situation. Yeah.

1222
01:10:08,910 --> 01:10:10,830
And that's where I get frustrated.
But it's good.

1223
01:10:10,890 --> 01:10:13,830
I need that frustration cause I'll be
in a position and in my head I'm like,

1224
01:10:14,370 --> 01:10:16,490
I could just punch you
right now in the face,

1225
01:10:17,430 --> 01:10:20,520
but I can't cause they're grappling.
Um,

1226
01:10:20,670 --> 01:10:24,300
so your schedule that you're laying out,
is this a schedule of Jackson?

1227
01:10:24,430 --> 01:10:26,190
John is just their schedule.
So

1228
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:29,050
yeah, that's what I do in
the mornings at the gym.

1229
01:10:29,350 --> 01:10:34,030
So who sets up like when you're in camp,
when you have to,

1230
01:10:34,031 --> 01:10:37,390
do you know, you, you've got to
fight. It's 12 weeks from now.

1231
01:10:37,690 --> 01:10:39,190
Who sets up your schedule?

1232
01:10:39,820 --> 01:10:44,070
Uh, I think what what we do is we
get a fight skeletal then, then we,

1233
01:10:44,130 --> 01:10:48,620
we get all the coaches and together. And
so my Jujitsu coach, I go to Gracie Baha,

1234
01:10:48,621 --> 01:10:53,060
fruit Jujitsu, so Jujitsu,
wrestling, you know, coach Jackson,

1235
01:10:53,061 --> 01:10:56,170
coach Winkeljohn in your,

1236
01:10:56,220 --> 01:10:58,700
and my husband and my
husband's with me all the time.

1237
01:10:58,701 --> 01:11:01,900
So he kind of oversees everything.
And uh,

1238
01:11:02,420 --> 01:11:05,240
we just sit down and we talk about all
the things we need to get together.

1239
01:11:05,270 --> 01:11:08,180
I do one pilot with coach Jackson a week.

1240
01:11:08,181 --> 01:11:12,110
I do two privates with coach wink a
week and do a private with a coach via

1241
01:11:12,130 --> 01:11:15,960
cellular. And then I do all
those in the morning and then I,

1242
01:11:16,110 --> 01:11:19,740
and then I work out at my house as well.
And then I do Jujitsu.

1243
01:11:19,810 --> 01:11:22,980
What do you do at your house?
Um, it depends on the day.

1244
01:11:23,460 --> 01:11:26,400
Sometimes we do simulations
will do like round simulations.

1245
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:28,710
Sometimes it's just hardcore cardio.

1246
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:32,520
Sometimes it's just technical set up
in your garage or something. Yeah.

1247
01:11:32,580 --> 01:11:36,780
That's nice. So you got a home gym and
we gotta we got a clear light sauna.

1248
01:11:36,781 --> 01:11:39,620
We got a for your health. Um,
what's a clear light? Sorry.

1249
01:11:39,780 --> 01:11:44,700
It's like it's an infrared sauna and
then we have a cold plunge. Oh, nice.

1250
01:11:45,240 --> 01:11:48,330
And so, and I can get something men
at home, everything. Everything.

1251
01:11:48,331 --> 01:11:51,390
If we needed to, we could do our whole
Canada. Oh, that's good. But, um,

1252
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:56,130
I really enjoy being at the gym around
my teammates and around my coaches and

1253
01:11:56,730 --> 01:11:59,400
just pulling energy from
them, you know, for sure.

1254
01:11:59,850 --> 01:12:02,220
What about strength and conditioning and
how often are you doing that? I just,

1255
01:12:02,221 --> 01:12:05,640
Shane, um, I do more strive to
conditioning when I'm out of camp.

1256
01:12:05,850 --> 01:12:09,720
So like right now I'm doing strength
and conditioning like three,

1257
01:12:09,721 --> 01:12:12,390
four times a week. Uh,
but when I'm in camp,

1258
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:14,850
it depends on my body in,

1259
01:12:14,851 --> 01:12:18,570
it depends on what I'm needing
at the time. But I usually

1260
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:23,250
once or twice a week and then I run

1261
01:12:24,990 --> 01:12:29,070
just for maintenance just for like
metal, like meditative running, you know?

1262
01:12:29,071 --> 01:12:33,270
Nothing hard to like longer
distance but slower. Yeah.

1263
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:36,930
But not even too long. Like three
minutes. The three miles. Yeah.

1264
01:12:37,020 --> 01:12:41,130
Nothing crazy that hill that
Jackson loves to throw people up.

1265
01:12:41,160 --> 01:12:45,270
What is that all about? That looks
crazy. It is crazy. I mean, it's, um,

1266
01:12:46,360 --> 01:12:50,820
it, coach Jackson always
says, if the mountain can't
beat you, nobody can be too,

1267
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:54,000
you know, it's like mother nature,
Mother Nature as a mother, you know,

1268
01:12:55,790 --> 01:12:58,950
there's something about that steep
ass hill too. And it's crazy.

1269
01:12:58,980 --> 01:13:02,160
The whole team running up at
[inaudible]. It's crazy because, well,

1270
01:13:02,161 --> 01:13:06,120
there's that one. But then coach wink has
another one and that one's just insane.

1271
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:10,140
You can't sprint up at you like crawl
up it and it's, yeah, it's ridiculous.

1272
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:13,320
How steep is it? It's so steep.
You can't run. You have to like,

1273
01:13:13,590 --> 01:13:15,570
you have to basically
the first three sprints,

1274
01:13:15,571 --> 01:13:17,940
there's 10 sprints to
the top and then you,

1275
01:13:18,090 --> 01:13:22,500
and then you slowly jogged back
down because it's a really steep,

1276
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:25,800
but the first three you
really can't sprint up,

1277
01:13:25,801 --> 01:13:30,720
but you kind of have to bear crawl up
them the mountain as fast as you can,

1278
01:13:30,780 --> 01:13:34,890
as fast as you can.
But the one I'm the Hilah tears is,

1279
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:38,010
is crazy because of the
color. The Halo Tiers. Yeah.

1280
01:13:39,180 --> 01:13:43,260
It's like it goes up,
it goes up and then it goes up.

1281
01:13:44,060 --> 01:13:46,350
So like when you think
you're almost there,

1282
01:13:46,351 --> 01:13:51,351
it like cranks up even harder and then
you have to get to the top and um,

1283
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:55,070
it will test you for sure. It
can break you. Well, that camp

1284
01:13:55,130 --> 01:13:57,260
was known for its endurance.

1285
01:13:57,560 --> 01:14:01,640
Like the fighters that come out of that
camp are known for having great cardio.

1286
01:14:01,850 --> 01:14:06,440
Yeah. And how often do those Jackson maker
or Winkeljohn make everybody do those?

1287
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:08,490
It just depends.
Um,

1288
01:14:08,940 --> 01:14:12,700
we used to do them as teams
as quite a bit as a team,

1289
01:14:12,701 --> 01:14:16,990
quite a bit on the weekends. But you
know, coach Jackson, coach Wayne. Yup. Oh,

1290
01:14:16,991 --> 01:14:21,150
that's me. That's my
sister. That's my dog. My,

1291
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:24,310
my Adobe.
It doesn't look like anything really.

1292
01:14:24,670 --> 01:14:29,110
No, it looks like it to me. Yeah. I'm used
to running hills. I know what it's like.

1293
01:14:29,980 --> 01:14:33,940
That it's terrible. Yeah. It looks
like that. Yeah. That's a feels like,

1294
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:36,320
yeah.
Well it's,

1295
01:14:36,321 --> 01:14:40,420
it's amazing how gravity is one
of the best things to work with.

1296
01:14:40,720 --> 01:14:42,130
Like get a good pitch,

1297
01:14:42,220 --> 01:14:46,540
good steep angle and try to run up
that this is one of the best things for

1298
01:14:46,541 --> 01:14:49,270
strength and conditioning for just
conditioning your lungs and your,

1299
01:14:49,271 --> 01:14:50,440
your ability to recover.

1300
01:14:50,610 --> 01:14:55,530
Yeah. Yeah. I love it.
I think that, um, again,

1301
01:14:55,531 --> 01:14:59,280
it's another one of those things that
can,

1302
01:14:59,310 --> 01:15:02,130
can really break you.
And uh,

1303
01:15:03,150 --> 01:15:05,940
I think it's just like a,
a theme,

1304
01:15:06,210 --> 01:15:10,650
like a consistent theme in fighting is,
is will you break,

1305
01:15:11,150 --> 01:15:15,450
can you, if you break then you're
not meant for it, you know, or,

1306
01:15:15,540 --> 01:15:18,300
or maybe you are and you just need to,
to heal.

1307
01:15:18,301 --> 01:15:21,000
Up and go back at it and try it again.
But

1308
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:23,530
when you,
in terms of your mental endurance,

1309
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:24,790
I mean that's what we're talking about,
right?

1310
01:15:24,791 --> 01:15:28,210
We're talking about four to two and
your spirit, your indomitable spirit.

1311
01:15:28,660 --> 01:15:32,530
When if you go back to when you
first started fighting versus now,

1312
01:15:33,130 --> 01:15:37,000
like your tolerance must be through
the roof. Like what you can tolerate,

1313
01:15:37,390 --> 01:15:40,470
what you can endure and your
belief in yourself. Yeah.

1314
01:15:40,510 --> 01:15:44,230
All that stuff I feel evolves.
Just like your skills do.

1315
01:15:44,570 --> 01:15:48,690
Yeah, 100% and, and, but it's crazy
too because you know, we all have our,

1316
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:52,910
our own separate journeys and I feel
like when you first start fighting,

1317
01:15:52,911 --> 01:15:55,980
just like when you're a kid and
you jump off of things and you,

1318
01:15:55,981 --> 01:15:58,730
you're fearless because you don't
know what it feels like to get hurt.

1319
01:15:59,240 --> 01:16:01,610
And then you break your leg
and then you're like, oh,
I'll never doing that again.

1320
01:16:01,670 --> 01:16:03,650
You know?
I feel like it's the same in fighting.

1321
01:16:03,651 --> 01:16:07,430
Like when you see a lot of amateur
fighters or, or new fighters,

1322
01:16:07,490 --> 01:16:10,820
they go out there and they just do
whatever because they're fearless.

1323
01:16:10,970 --> 01:16:13,730
They've never been knocked
out there, never been hit.
They never broken anything.

1324
01:16:13,731 --> 01:16:17,630
And so they're just going to go out
there and, and, and be fearless and,

1325
01:16:17,690 --> 01:16:21,710
and then they get knocked out or submitted
and then the next time they go out,

1326
01:16:21,711 --> 01:16:26,540
they're not as as free. Um,
and I think the, the truth,

1327
01:16:26,990 --> 01:16:30,380
the true test is to see if, you
know, you can deal with those,

1328
01:16:30,770 --> 01:16:33,380
those challenges and allow it to,

1329
01:16:34,270 --> 01:16:38,720
to make you grow versus,
you know,

1330
01:16:38,810 --> 01:16:42,480
petrify you and make you go
backwards, you know? Yeah.

1331
01:16:42,500 --> 01:16:45,140
Do you do any psychological training?

1332
01:16:45,170 --> 01:16:47,630
Do you have a mental coach
or a hip and test? Right.

1333
01:16:48,100 --> 01:16:52,640
I do. I have a sports psychologist,
Dr. Shannon, and he's, he's, um,

1334
01:16:52,790 --> 01:16:56,000
he's been working with me from my last
few fights and I won all three fights.

1335
01:16:56,001 --> 01:16:59,720
And I think that's a,
a big reason why for sure.

1336
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:04,300
I,
I think that is a giant overlooked factor.

1337
01:17:04,390 --> 01:17:06,220
And some people get
along great without it,

1338
01:17:06,940 --> 01:17:10,090
but could they be even better with
it? That's the rule. Yeah, I think so.

1339
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:10,380
Yeah,

1340
01:17:10,380 --> 01:17:11,213
absolutely.

1341
01:17:12,390 --> 01:17:15,840
There's so much that goes into fighting
that I think people don't see. You know,

1342
01:17:15,841 --> 01:17:17,580
I think it's just like
with anything in life,

1343
01:17:17,581 --> 01:17:22,581
like how long it takes to make a
movie versus the actual movie and,

1344
01:17:22,641 --> 01:17:23,474
and,

1345
01:17:23,820 --> 01:17:28,820
and what goes into that 15 minutes
of a fight that nobody even knows,

1346
01:17:29,581 --> 01:17:33,760
you know, not just eight weeks,
but your entire, you know,

1347
01:17:33,880 --> 01:17:36,900
training before that. You
know, for me it's, you know,

1348
01:17:36,901 --> 01:17:41,340
I've been doing martial arts since I was
10 and fighting professionally for over

1349
01:17:41,341 --> 01:17:45,900
10 years. And so it, it's an
accumulation of all of those things.

1350
01:17:45,901 --> 01:17:47,280
But um,

1351
01:17:48,120 --> 01:17:52,890
each fight presents its own problem and
if you're not mentally prepared for it,

1352
01:17:52,891 --> 01:17:57,150
if you're not prepared physically for not
prepared, like spiritually, emotionally,

1353
01:17:57,390 --> 01:18:02,120
like hormonally, if
that's even a word, um,

1354
01:18:02,520 --> 01:18:05,370
everything has to line up that one night,

1355
01:18:05,610 --> 01:18:09,750
those 15 minutes or 25 minutes
in order for you to win. And, um,

1356
01:18:10,410 --> 01:18:13,290
you can definitely beat yourself
before you step into the octagon.

1357
01:18:13,780 --> 01:18:17,680
So what kind of stuff do you work on
with your psychologist without giving too

1358
01:18:17,681 --> 01:18:18,514
much away?

1359
01:18:19,190 --> 01:18:22,190
I talked to him about this all the time
cause it's like my secret sauce. Right?

1360
01:18:22,191 --> 01:18:26,570
But how he explains his is everybody
knows what you're supposed to do,

1361
01:18:26,730 --> 01:18:28,190
but you have to put in the work.

1362
01:18:28,250 --> 01:18:31,360
Just like physically you have to put
in the work. Like I can sit up here,

1363
01:18:31,430 --> 01:18:32,390
I can tell you what I do,

1364
01:18:32,391 --> 01:18:37,010
but it's not going to make a difference
unless you actually put in the work to,

1365
01:18:37,160 --> 01:18:41,780
to, to strengthen your
mind mentally. Um, but um,

1366
01:18:41,900 --> 01:18:45,110
we do a lot of,
um,

1367
01:18:46,330 --> 01:18:47,330
so your opponent,

1368
01:18:47,331 --> 01:18:51,470
it's not like you can practice barring
them because you've never fought them

1369
01:18:51,471 --> 01:18:52,550
before.
Um,

1370
01:18:53,510 --> 01:18:58,510
and so how he explains it to
me is it's just a repetition,

1371
01:18:59,250 --> 01:19:01,370
you know,
of the mind and um,

1372
01:19:01,850 --> 01:19:03,290
okay,
so when,

1373
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:08,570
so you just have to really,
I think explore your imagination.

1374
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:13,340
And um, for us, we,

1375
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:16,630
we practice the fight in her head.
And um,

1376
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:18,980
some days are harder than others.

1377
01:19:18,981 --> 01:19:22,700
Sometimes I win the fight in the
first 10 seconds of the, of the round.

1378
01:19:22,701 --> 01:19:26,720
Sometimes it's all five
rounds and it's a war and,

1379
01:19:26,870 --> 01:19:29,240
and I win that way.
But you have to,

1380
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:32,690
you have to see yourself going through
every different scenario and there are

1381
01:19:32,691 --> 01:19:37,090
millions in MMA and you just practice
them over and over and over. Okay.

1382
01:19:37,240 --> 01:19:40,060
So it's essentially just
going through that or do you,

1383
01:19:40,570 --> 01:19:45,570
do you prepare your mindset
in terms of do is for,

1384
01:19:47,260 --> 01:19:51,220
for, for, for me, I have a set of
power where there's what he calls him.

1385
01:19:51,640 --> 01:19:54,910
Power words won't tell us what they are.
And so,

1386
01:19:56,470 --> 01:20:01,240
um, yeah, I again, um, confidence,

1387
01:20:02,770 --> 01:20:07,440
uh, flow vicious.

1388
01:20:09,260 --> 01:20:12,300
Um,
thank think I'm trying to see

1389
01:20:13,830 --> 01:20:14,670
mom champ.

1390
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,220
Mom Champion. Yeah. Cause you
want to be the first mom champ.

1391
01:20:17,300 --> 01:20:19,430
Yes sir.
Um,

1392
01:20:23,690 --> 01:20:24,523
healthy.

1393
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:29,433
Yeah.

1394
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:31,140
There are a couple of others as well,

1395
01:20:32,310 --> 01:20:36,810
but the one word is,

1396
01:20:37,560 --> 01:20:42,090
is not just a word. It's
like a whole thought process.
So when I say one word, it,

1397
01:20:42,440 --> 01:20:46,830
it feeds into an entire feeling,
if that makes any sense.

1398
01:20:47,460 --> 01:20:52,460
And so instead of having to
have a conversation in my mind,

1399
01:20:53,970 --> 01:20:55,470
which takes way too long,

1400
01:20:55,920 --> 01:21:00,780
I just say confidence and it takes
me where I need to be. And, um,

1401
01:21:00,840 --> 01:21:03,900
eventually I want,
you shouldn't even have to do that.

1402
01:21:04,380 --> 01:21:09,380
You should just be in the
moment and just allow your,

1403
01:21:09,800 --> 01:21:11,430
your mind to connect with your body.

1404
01:21:13,890 --> 01:21:17,910
Do you do any meditating
at all? Yeah, I mean,

1405
01:21:17,911 --> 01:21:20,190
I would say it's kind of a meditative,

1406
01:21:21,400 --> 01:21:21,690
yeah,

1407
01:21:21,690 --> 01:21:23,980
I, I would say it's more of, of, of,

1408
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:28,210
of a practice than it is meditation
because I'm not trying to clear my mind.

1409
01:21:28,240 --> 01:21:32,320
I'm really trying to focus
on something specific. Right.

1410
01:21:32,590 --> 01:21:36,780
But outside of that, you don't
meditate? Uh, I wouldn't say sell.

1411
01:21:36,781 --> 01:21:40,540
Maybe just maybe in my runs.
Sometimes when I run I just,

1412
01:21:40,720 --> 01:21:43,210
that's when I clear my mind.
How about you?

1413
01:21:43,730 --> 01:21:46,250
Yeah, I've been doing it a little
bit, but most of what I do,

1414
01:21:46,251 --> 01:21:50,270
I do what I get in the tank. Float tank.
I like float tank. Do you, do you use one?

1415
01:21:50,360 --> 01:21:54,620
I have before. It feels like you're
floating in space. Yeah. That's amazing.

1416
01:21:54,650 --> 01:21:58,090
Does Jackson's have one? No. They
should have won. We should. Huh?

1417
01:21:58,130 --> 01:22:01,790
So if you wouldn't want to go in there
after God disgusting. And we have this,

1418
01:22:02,040 --> 01:22:05,600
we have a hot sauna at the gym
and there's tons of people.

1419
01:22:05,630 --> 01:22:10,470
There's tons of people. So it gets, could
you, yeah, no, I'm sure the hot sauna,

1420
01:22:10,490 --> 01:22:13,160
those different than a float
tank is full tanks. So personal.

1421
01:22:13,210 --> 01:22:18,210
It's just one little [inaudible] naked
[inaudible] is they showed me yours and

1422
01:22:18,981 --> 01:22:22,780
it felt hotter than the ones that I've
ever done. Is this the right temperature?

1423
01:22:22,790 --> 01:22:26,450
Is it? Yeah. Okay. Cause 94 degrees,
that's what it should be. Yeah.

1424
01:22:26,451 --> 01:22:27,710
It should be the same as the surface

1425
01:22:27,960 --> 01:22:30,630
as your body temperature.
Right? Yeah. Cause it was crazy.

1426
01:22:30,631 --> 01:22:32,850
I remember doing at one time and

1427
01:22:34,680 --> 01:22:38,700
I kind of drifted off and I remember
almost waking up and feeling like I was

1428
01:22:38,701 --> 01:22:40,560
like floating in space. Yeah, sure.

1429
01:22:40,620 --> 01:22:45,090
Almost like kind of panicked because
I didn't have a sense of where my,

1430
01:22:45,210 --> 01:22:47,580
what my where my body was.
Yeah.

1431
01:22:47,890 --> 01:22:49,870
That's what triggers is
weird psychedelic states.

1432
01:22:49,871 --> 01:22:53,080
But if you can find one and
use it on a regular basis,

1433
01:22:53,081 --> 01:22:55,840
it works great with visualization
and a lot of athletes,

1434
01:22:56,260 --> 01:23:00,970
UFC and other sports as well. They,
they use it for visualization.

1435
01:23:01,130 --> 01:23:06,130
I till think about passes like throwing
a pass and then watching someone catch

1436
01:23:06,250 --> 01:23:09,280
it. They'll, they'll visualize
things and go through the, the,

1437
01:23:09,281 --> 01:23:12,910
the technique in their head.
And I've done that with Jujitsu as well.

1438
01:23:12,940 --> 01:23:15,580
I've done that with certain techniques
that I was really trying to learn.

1439
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:19,150
You could do it as if you're
rolling, you know, like you're,

1440
01:23:19,180 --> 01:23:23,020
you're just like picturing your body
going through the different positions.

1441
01:23:23,110 --> 01:23:26,280
Yeah, yeah. That's
basically what we do, um,

1442
01:23:26,440 --> 01:23:28,830
with the mental training and,
um,

1443
01:23:30,280 --> 01:23:34,900
it probably just take it up a notch
in the, um, in the float tank. Yeah,

1444
01:23:34,901 --> 01:23:39,610
I'm sure. But a lot of times,
like when I meet up with my,

1445
01:23:40,140 --> 01:23:41,170
with Dr. Shannon,

1446
01:23:41,230 --> 01:23:45,520
we meet up at at noisy places
like Starbucks or you know,

1447
01:23:45,550 --> 01:23:50,140
or at a coffee shop or something like
that. And it's because he wants, he that,

1448
01:23:50,290 --> 01:23:54,180
that life is always going
to have distractions. Oh,
that's interesting. And, um,

1449
01:23:54,220 --> 01:23:57,430
you know, you need to be able to
focus with instruction, especially me.

1450
01:23:57,431 --> 01:24:01,630
Like there's so many things going on in
my life with being a mother and a wife,

1451
01:24:01,660 --> 01:24:02,493
um,

1452
01:24:02,740 --> 01:24:07,740
that sometimes I can use the distractions
as an excuse to justify why I'm not

1453
01:24:07,751 --> 01:24:10,740
getting things done or this or
that. You know? Right. And, um,

1454
01:24:10,780 --> 01:24:13,870
so that's something that I've
really been working hard at is to,

1455
01:24:13,871 --> 01:24:17,950
not to not use those as
excuses, but more so to, to,

1456
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:23,110
to allow the distractions to happen and,
and choose to stay focused anyways.

1457
01:24:23,450 --> 01:24:25,920
Um,
there are,

1458
01:24:26,040 --> 01:24:29,790
there's quite a few
women's MMA fighters now,

1459
01:24:29,791 --> 01:24:32,310
but it's still small in comparison to men.

1460
01:24:32,700 --> 01:24:35,760
When you meet young girls
that look up to you,

1461
01:24:35,761 --> 01:24:39,930
do you recognize that the,
you have, you have a very,

1462
01:24:40,130 --> 01:24:44,280
this is a very critical,
and it's a very small role.

1463
01:24:44,490 --> 01:24:48,840
There's an in small, in terms
of small amount of people
providing that role. Yeah.

1464
01:24:48,990 --> 01:24:53,850
As role models to young kids
that are thinking about fighting.

1465
01:24:53,851 --> 01:24:58,740
When a young girl meets you, like, oh my
God, it's the karate hottie like, is it,

1466
01:24:58,890 --> 01:24:59,701
is it weird to you?

1467
01:24:59,701 --> 01:25:02,940
Like what is that feeling like to you
when you meet a young girl and you say,

1468
01:25:02,941 --> 01:25:04,390
Oh my God,
this is me when I was six?

1469
01:25:04,500 --> 01:25:05,970
Yeah.
It's amazing.

1470
01:25:06,180 --> 01:25:11,180
It really is to know that just through
my story that I've touched people's

1471
01:25:11,551 --> 01:25:16,350
lives, you know, um, I get
approached a lot by, by parents,

1472
01:25:16,850 --> 01:25:21,330
you know, that are happy that
I'm pursuing what I'm pursuing,

1473
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:25,680
even being a mom, you know, so, um,

1474
01:25:25,860 --> 01:25:28,500
I think that's really cool just because

1475
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:35,250
I feel like when I was pregnant,
um,

1476
01:25:35,940 --> 01:25:39,460
how old's your daughter now?
She's eight. Yeah. So when I was,

1477
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:42,000
she was much younger for some reason.
I know she's a shrimp.

1478
01:25:42,001 --> 01:25:45,300
That's why I showed the pictures
when she was younger. She is anybody.

1479
01:25:45,530 --> 01:25:49,050
I I,
this might be too much information,

1480
01:25:49,051 --> 01:25:52,650
but um,
after I had my daughter,

1481
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:56,190
she's been to every single
one of my fights. Um, and uh,

1482
01:25:56,370 --> 01:26:00,840
I had my first fight back when I was 10
months old and I was still breastfeeding.

1483
01:26:00,841 --> 01:26:01,710
I like breastfed

1484
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:03,950
when she was 10 months old.
Now you were 10 months old

1485
01:26:04,390 --> 01:26:08,630
when she was tennis. Wow. You had a
fight while you were breastfeeding.

1486
01:26:09,530 --> 01:26:12,080
That was your first fight? My
first fight back. Oh, okay.

1487
01:26:12,260 --> 01:26:16,750
How many fights did you have before
your daughter? Oh, I had a good amount.

1488
01:26:16,751 --> 01:26:17,584
I'd say.

1489
01:26:17,700 --> 01:26:20,880
I don't even as you've been fighting for
10 years, professional years, 12 years

1490
01:26:21,750 --> 01:26:23,940
[inaudible] yeah,
a good amount.

1491
01:26:25,140 --> 01:26:28,860
I was 25 when I had her when
I was pregnant. But yeah,

1492
01:26:28,861 --> 01:26:31,590
I just remember being pregnant and being,

1493
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:34,230
everybody talks about like
postpartum depression,

1494
01:26:34,231 --> 01:26:38,550
but I was really depressed during my
pregnancy. I mean, don't get me wrong.

1495
01:26:38,551 --> 01:26:42,570
I loved being pregnant and there was a
lot of memories that I had with her being

1496
01:26:42,571 --> 01:26:47,520
in my belly and me feeling her and
all of this and that, that, um,

1497
01:26:47,640 --> 01:26:51,840
those moments I, I treasure
forever, but I was depressed.

1498
01:26:51,841 --> 01:26:54,990
Like I couldn't do what I wanted to do.
It's not like I could go out and,

1499
01:26:55,050 --> 01:26:56,490
you know, I fell, I was feeling bad.

1500
01:26:56,491 --> 01:26:59,430
I couldn't just throw the gloves on and
go out and spar and hit somebody in the

1501
01:26:59,431 --> 01:26:59,850
face.

1502
01:26:59,850 --> 01:27:04,530
So, you know, like, you know, normal
thing that you do to relieve stress.

1503
01:27:06,260 --> 01:27:07,520
And I just,
I,

1504
01:27:08,240 --> 01:27:12,680
I've watched everybody get better
and I watched everybody progress and,

1505
01:27:12,770 --> 01:27:17,020
and fight and it, you know,
it ate me alive and I just, I,

1506
01:27:17,060 --> 01:27:19,850
there was just so much
uncertainty and so much unknown.

1507
01:27:19,851 --> 01:27:22,970
Was my body going to be the same, you
know, it was I going to even want it.

1508
01:27:22,971 --> 01:27:25,280
Was I going to have time to do it?
Um,

1509
01:27:25,940 --> 01:27:29,450
there were just so much that
I didn't know until I was,

1510
01:27:29,720 --> 01:27:31,670
I was really down then. And I, um,

1511
01:27:32,390 --> 01:27:37,390
I get a lot of moms that approach me and
they tell me that because I went back

1512
01:27:38,031 --> 01:27:42,800
and continued to pursue my dream that
they did to, you know, and I think that,

1513
01:27:43,070 --> 01:27:46,190
um, that's cool. That is cool.

1514
01:27:46,690 --> 01:27:51,160
Now when you say you had your
first fight back 10 months, that's,

1515
01:27:51,250 --> 01:27:53,470
that's a really,
for people that don't recognize,

1516
01:27:53,471 --> 01:27:56,980
that's a very short amount of
time to rebound from giving birth,

1517
01:27:57,050 --> 01:28:00,640
then get yourself back in shape and
then get yourself into a fighting shape.

1518
01:28:00,670 --> 01:28:03,910
Yeah. Where you're like, I'm ready to
take a fight and then train for the fight.

1519
01:28:03,911 --> 01:28:07,360
I mean that is a incredible
process to go through in 10 months.

1520
01:28:07,540 --> 01:28:10,990
It was crazy. It really was.
My body was it when you,

1521
01:28:11,740 --> 01:28:13,030
when you have a baby,
your,

1522
01:28:13,420 --> 01:28:17,350
your bones kind of like drift
apart from each other and um,

1523
01:28:17,440 --> 01:28:21,970
you gain weight. And I, after I had
my daughter, I found out that I will,

1524
01:28:21,971 --> 01:28:26,020
during my pregnancy I got
gestational diabetes and um,

1525
01:28:26,080 --> 01:28:30,730
and I gained like 50 pounds. I
gained a lot. Like I looked like,

1526
01:28:30,731 --> 01:28:33,130
um,
the blueberry on a Willy Wonka.

1527
01:28:36,460 --> 01:28:37,270
But

1528
01:28:37,270 --> 01:28:39,990
um, yeah, I I,

1529
01:28:40,060 --> 01:28:43,020
how long did it take you to bounce
back where you in the gym again? Yeah.

1530
01:28:43,640 --> 01:28:48,260
I probably stayed with my daughter for
the first three months that I had her and

1531
01:28:48,320 --> 01:28:50,240
I just wanted to be a mom.

1532
01:28:50,390 --> 01:28:54,710
I just wanted to be with her and I
wanted to nurture her and you know,

1533
01:28:54,770 --> 01:28:56,790
enjoy my time with her.
Uh,

1534
01:28:56,870 --> 01:28:59,690
and I think it was after three
months where I was like, I,

1535
01:29:00,680 --> 01:29:05,670
I want to take somebody that notes. But
yeah, hold on a, relieve some stress. So,

1536
01:29:06,690 --> 01:29:11,690
and coach wink and coach Jackson and
all my teammates were so supportive.

1537
01:29:11,941 --> 01:29:14,790
And so I would come into the
gym and I'd have, you know,

1538
01:29:14,791 --> 01:29:19,770
my diaper bag in one hand and my gym bag
in the other and my car seat. And I'd,

1539
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:23,550
I'd come into the gym and I'd set it all
down and I'd get wrapped up and she'd

1540
01:29:23,610 --> 01:29:27,270
be in the car seat and she chill out
and wow. If she would start to cry,

1541
01:29:27,271 --> 01:29:30,750
coach wink or a coach, Jackson would
pick her up and then, you know,

1542
01:29:30,751 --> 01:29:35,250
they'd let me spar and you know, she
needed to get, she needed to eat.

1543
01:29:35,250 --> 01:29:38,640
I would go to the room and feed
her and then come back and, and,

1544
01:29:38,830 --> 01:29:42,240
and we made it work. Wow. Yeah. So, um,

1545
01:29:42,510 --> 01:29:46,250
so I started training for that
and I really couldn't run to,

1546
01:29:46,290 --> 01:29:50,370
to lose the weight because my joints
and my bones were like all spread apart,

1547
01:29:50,371 --> 01:29:53,760
you know. So when you say
spread apart, like what actually
does happen? Well, they,

1548
01:29:54,330 --> 01:29:56,880
I mean, I don't know like all
the, the science behind it,

1549
01:29:56,881 --> 01:30:00,330
but they just say that in
order to like have the baby,

1550
01:30:00,360 --> 01:30:02,970
like everything kind of
separates from each other. Your,

1551
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:08,000
your bones like loosen and you're like
more agile and loose and stuff like that.

1552
01:30:08,910 --> 01:30:09,743
And so

1553
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:12,280
felt it, I felt a big
difference in the way your body.

1554
01:30:12,700 --> 01:30:15,670
Yeah, for sure. I felt it. And um,

1555
01:30:17,110 --> 01:30:22,110
so instead of running I would swim
from my cardio and that helped me,

1556
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:24,070
um,

1557
01:30:24,070 --> 01:30:26,920
cause it wasn't hard on my joints or
anything like that and it kind of helps me

1558
01:30:26,921 --> 01:30:29,740
get back into shape and you kind of just,

1559
01:30:30,070 --> 01:30:33,340
you kind of just go with the
flow and figure it out as you go.

1560
01:30:33,400 --> 01:30:34,420
It was really hard.

1561
01:30:34,450 --> 01:30:39,450
I was worried that I was worried that
because I got back into sparring and this

1562
01:30:39,521 --> 01:30:42,640
and that, that um, I would go dry,

1563
01:30:42,670 --> 01:30:47,590
like my milk would go dry but I
didn't, it just, my body just figured,

1564
01:30:47,591 --> 01:30:50,350
okay this is what, what you do. And I,

1565
01:30:50,351 --> 01:30:55,300
I still produce milk and everything and
it was really sensitive at first to get

1566
01:30:55,301 --> 01:30:59,110
hit and, and then I just got
used to the pain and then wow.

1567
01:31:00,760 --> 01:31:05,230
How many would have one of those? I'm
like, yikes. Yeah, I would imagine you're,

1568
01:31:05,980 --> 01:31:10,780
yeah. I mean, if your memories,
you know, like pump up.

1569
01:31:10,900 --> 01:31:14,680
Yeah. It's, it's, the body is just
so amazing though. Like it'll,

1570
01:31:14,740 --> 01:31:17,950
it'll adapt to what it needs to adapt to.
And,

1571
01:31:18,580 --> 01:31:23,350
and when I trained, I got used to the
pain and then it didn't hurt anymore.

1572
01:31:23,410 --> 01:31:27,670
And then, you know, my, I would
only produce as much as she needed.

1573
01:31:28,490 --> 01:31:29,740
It was really cool.
Yeah.

1574
01:31:29,850 --> 01:31:31,730
Now when you fought 10 months,

1575
01:31:31,750 --> 01:31:35,850
it's pretty incredible for your
daughter to have only seen you fighting.

1576
01:31:36,450 --> 01:31:39,960
That's gotta be crazy too, right? Yeah.
Can't remember when you weren't fighting.

1577
01:31:40,030 --> 01:31:41,850
Yeah.
My mom kicks ass.

1578
01:31:42,150 --> 01:31:46,320
Yeah, she has, she has a really cool
upbringing, I think. Like she's just,

1579
01:31:47,520 --> 01:31:52,410
she's,
she's surrounded by really cool people.

1580
01:31:52,500 --> 01:31:55,710
Like she gets to meet the coolest people
in the world and they're normal to her

1581
01:31:55,860 --> 01:31:59,860
because that, you know, she, she sees
John and Holly and you know, that's,

1582
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:03,280
that's Auntie Holly to
her. And so like, you know,

1583
01:32:03,550 --> 01:32:08,260
her expectations for, for what she
can be in life I think are way higher,

1584
01:32:08,590 --> 01:32:13,310
you know? And I think because she's
surrounded by people like that, that shit.

1585
01:32:13,420 --> 01:32:16,690
And that's why I like to
keep around because you know,

1586
01:32:18,550 --> 01:32:20,660
my dad used to always tell me that,
um,

1587
01:32:22,330 --> 01:32:26,350
we learned through our actions,
our parents' actions. You
know, you walk the walk,

1588
01:32:26,351 --> 01:32:27,220
you don't talk the talk.

1589
01:32:27,221 --> 01:32:32,221
And so I think the best teacher can be
my actions and for her to see it through

1590
01:32:34,931 --> 01:32:38,230
her own eyes. I can tell her
this, this, and this all day. But,

1591
01:32:38,890 --> 01:32:42,400
but it's a different story when she
comes to a fight with me and I am the

1592
01:32:42,401 --> 01:32:43,234
champion,

1593
01:32:43,720 --> 01:32:48,160
the one oh five champion and I'm
defending my belt and you know,

1594
01:32:48,161 --> 01:32:52,030
I bust my eye open to the point where
you can't see it anymore and I lose my

1595
01:32:52,031 --> 01:32:52,864
belt.

1596
01:32:53,350 --> 01:32:58,350
And for her to see that and for her to
see that Mommy's okay and that failure is

1597
01:32:59,411 --> 01:33:04,360
a part of life and that I still love
what I do and I'm going to still go after

1598
01:33:04,840 --> 01:33:09,800
you know, my set of dreams because failure
is a part of your journey. You know,

1599
01:33:10,340 --> 01:33:14,660
that's amazing lesson for kid learn
and to see that at a high level,

1600
01:33:14,661 --> 01:33:18,860
growing up with her mother on this giant
stage in front of all these people in

1601
01:33:18,861 --> 01:33:21,890
the crowd and television,
that's amazing for her.

1602
01:33:22,680 --> 01:33:24,780
Yeah. And because people
ask me all the time, like,

1603
01:33:24,781 --> 01:33:28,770
is w w aren't you afraid that she's going
to see you get hurt and this and that,

1604
01:33:28,771 --> 01:33:33,120
but why would you want to shield them
from that stuff? I know, I know. It's,

1605
01:33:33,180 --> 01:33:36,360
it's hard. It's a hard pill to swallow.
You don't want your children to see you,

1606
01:33:36,361 --> 01:33:40,560
her and this and that. But I'd rather
her see it and be prepared for it,

1607
01:33:41,730 --> 01:33:45,840
you know? Because life isn't fair. Life
isn't sunshine and rainbows all the time.

1608
01:33:46,090 --> 01:33:49,530
Yeah. It's challenging for her
and challenging things for kids.

1609
01:33:49,920 --> 01:33:52,920
That's how they grow, you know? Um,

1610
01:33:52,950 --> 01:33:57,270
that that's do you have,
when you think about your career,

1611
01:33:57,330 --> 01:33:59,970
do you have a timeline where
you don't want to fight anymore?

1612
01:34:01,800 --> 01:34:04,950
How old are you now? I'd like to fight
for the belt this year. This year? Yeah.

1613
01:34:05,280 --> 01:34:09,150
You're 30,
33 33 so you're in your prime.

1614
01:34:09,360 --> 01:34:14,250
Like right now that's like an athlete's
prime is like 30 to like 35, 36. Yeah.

1615
01:34:14,610 --> 01:34:15,770
You're in that zone.
Yes.

1616
01:34:15,910 --> 01:34:18,370
I'm in the zone. I'm
confident. I feel ready.

1617
01:34:18,760 --> 01:34:21,490
I feel like I've gone through
my ups and downs. I've, I've,

1618
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:23,920
I've gone through all the steps that I,

1619
01:34:24,040 --> 01:34:27,850
that are necessary for me to be
confident to, to be a contender.

1620
01:34:28,380 --> 01:34:31,930
Okay. Do you have a timeline when you
want to stop? I would give myself,

1621
01:34:34,740 --> 01:34:37,780
I don't know, it just really
depends on how my career goes,

1622
01:34:37,781 --> 01:34:41,260
but I would say three to four more years.

1623
01:34:41,500 --> 01:34:44,020
So you're just,
you're just in the zone right now.

1624
01:34:44,021 --> 01:34:47,470
You're just concentrating on getting
things done, fighting for a title.

1625
01:34:47,770 --> 01:34:49,960
You're not thinking about
like planning the future up.

1626
01:34:51,360 --> 01:34:54,450
I would like my children. Oh. Um,

1627
01:34:54,990 --> 01:34:56,640
I know my husband doesn't care for him.

1628
01:34:56,641 --> 01:34:59,560
My daughter doesn't even care
for me to have challenge.

1629
01:35:00,020 --> 01:35:02,420
She'd rather just be the three
of us, you know? But, um,

1630
01:35:02,750 --> 01:35:07,040
I would like my children and,
um, I, I have taken steps to,

1631
01:35:07,820 --> 01:35:11,660
to figure out what I'm going to do when
I'm, when I retire as a fighter. Um,

1632
01:35:12,440 --> 01:35:13,310
but,
uh,

1633
01:35:14,880 --> 01:35:18,470
I feel like this story needs to,

1634
01:35:19,140 --> 01:35:23,390
I need to finish out the story
from my own sake and for, you know,

1635
01:35:24,260 --> 01:35:26,750
millions of other parents out there that,
you know,

1636
01:35:26,751 --> 01:35:30,950
have a dream and don't give up on
their dream and just because they have

1637
01:35:30,951 --> 01:35:35,330
children, it's a longer road,
but it's worth it. No. Yeah,

1638
01:35:35,810 --> 01:35:40,280
I hear Ya. Now when you look at the
division, it's an incredible division now.

1639
01:35:40,310 --> 01:35:44,030
So town stacked, we don't know
what's going to happen with rose.

1640
01:35:44,660 --> 01:35:46,760
She mean she's even said she might retire.
Yeah.

1641
01:35:46,880 --> 01:35:50,480
And she's a very eccentric person.
I mean she's,

1642
01:35:51,350 --> 01:35:54,530
she's not motivated by money.
She's very, very unusual.

1643
01:35:54,860 --> 01:35:59,600
And I love how honest she is about
her emotions. Yeah, I do as well.

1644
01:35:59,630 --> 01:36:00,740
Like she's very vulnerable.

1645
01:36:00,980 --> 01:36:02,570
She's very strong.
I mean,

1646
01:36:02,571 --> 01:36:07,430
in terms of like her ability to broadcast
that and tell everybody in project it.

1647
01:36:08,030 --> 01:36:09,830
Um,
so she was,

1648
01:36:10,230 --> 01:36:13,850
I felt like she was winning that
fight and I'm a hundred percent yeah,

1649
01:36:14,030 --> 01:36:17,860
she got caught with one of the craziest
slam chaos we've ever seen. I mean,

1650
01:36:17,861 --> 01:36:20,090
you've got to go back
to like Carlos Newton,

1651
01:36:20,091 --> 01:36:24,860
Matt Hughes to have a slam k like that.
Yeah, I don't, I'm trying to remember.

1652
01:36:25,130 --> 01:36:29,030
I guess one, it's one of the best
slam Kaos of all time PD. Tito Ortiz,

1653
01:36:29,031 --> 01:36:32,420
Evan Tanner. That was another
one. I mean, Slam Kao is a rare

1654
01:36:32,750 --> 01:36:36,520
and I love that it came from the
smallest division in the UFC. Right.

1655
01:36:36,680 --> 01:36:38,030
I think that is just amazing.

1656
01:36:38,420 --> 01:36:42,260
I'm just so proud of the strawweight
division if I can say so. But I do,

1657
01:36:42,261 --> 01:36:45,980
I think it's stacked.
I feel like in from my,

1658
01:36:47,480 --> 01:36:51,410
any fight that I have from here on out
is championship caliber fight in my

1659
01:36:51,411 --> 01:36:54,680
opinion. Yeah. Um, and that's
why I want to fight for the belt.

1660
01:36:54,681 --> 01:36:58,430
Like I want to go for the
belt so that it's legit.

1661
01:36:58,431 --> 01:37:00,560
Like we're fighting for the belt,
you know?

1662
01:37:00,590 --> 01:37:05,120
And after that it's a championship
fight every time. Yeah.

1663
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:09,900
When you're looking at that division,
do you have those two Jessica on drudge?

1664
01:37:09,960 --> 01:37:13,890
And we don't want, again, we do
not know where rose his head is at,

1665
01:37:13,891 --> 01:37:16,980
what she wants to do,
but if she wanted to have a rematch,

1666
01:37:17,010 --> 01:37:20,090
they probably would set that
up. Then you have you wanna. Um,

1667
01:37:20,430 --> 01:37:24,780
you have Tatiana Suarez who's a
beast. You have, you, you have,

1668
01:37:24,810 --> 01:37:26,310
who else in the division stands out?
Yeah.

1669
01:37:26,370 --> 01:37:30,910
To, um, well, Nina, sure. What Jenna
has to get through Nina first. Sure.

1670
01:37:30,911 --> 01:37:32,800
She kind of just write it under the radar.
I don't know.

1671
01:37:32,840 --> 01:37:34,840
The, our office, she's Badass

1672
01:37:35,110 --> 01:37:37,690
and maybe it's because,
and that's a problem that I've had to,

1673
01:37:37,691 --> 01:37:39,820
is that I'm not as vocal,
you know, she just,

1674
01:37:40,270 --> 01:37:42,850
she just goes in there and
does her thing. And, um,

1675
01:37:42,970 --> 01:37:47,940
and I think that a lot of people are
overlooking her as well. Sure. Um, and,

1676
01:37:47,980 --> 01:37:51,100
and that's why I'm just, I'm speaking
out now. This is what I want.

1677
01:37:51,370 --> 01:37:55,950
And Joshua's jokes. He says, we
get 100% what you don't ask for.

1678
01:37:57,170 --> 01:38:01,680
So, so I'm asking for it.
It's what I want, you know.
Um, but, uh, yeah, there's,

1679
01:38:02,070 --> 01:38:05,220
there's widely, um, so
I know that they're,

1680
01:38:05,340 --> 01:38:07,140
they're trying to pump
her and she's really good.

1681
01:38:07,141 --> 01:38:11,580
I'm coming out of China
and then, um, you know,

1682
01:38:11,581 --> 01:38:14,920
obviously Teesha Claudia and,

1683
01:38:14,921 --> 01:38:19,750
and even the girls outside of the
top 10 are dangerous. It's, it's,

1684
01:38:19,751 --> 01:38:22,560
it's a stacked division and in can go

1685
01:38:24,750 --> 01:38:26,820
probably the most talented
division I would say.

1686
01:38:26,821 --> 01:38:30,900
So for sure technically and heart driven,

1687
01:38:30,930 --> 01:38:32,400
I would say for sure.

1688
01:38:33,140 --> 01:38:37,340
Now, what have they said in terms
of like what your future holds,

1689
01:38:37,341 --> 01:38:41,330
if they have anything lined up
for you? When do they say, like,

1690
01:38:41,331 --> 01:38:44,120
if they're going to come to
you and say, hey, Michelle,

1691
01:38:44,121 --> 01:38:47,810
we'd like you to fight in
July or August or September.

1692
01:38:47,811 --> 01:38:48,920
Like when would they come to you?

1693
01:38:49,570 --> 01:38:51,010
I feel like,
um,

1694
01:38:53,740 --> 01:38:56,260
with the way that the rankings are,
are working,

1695
01:38:56,290 --> 01:39:01,290
if I just take a fight outside of who the,

1696
01:39:01,510 --> 01:39:04,180
who is the current champ,
I'm going to be in the same spot.

1697
01:39:04,750 --> 01:39:09,100
I've won my last two fights and I've gone
down and rankings, you know, so I, um,

1698
01:39:09,760 --> 01:39:10,210
I,

1699
01:39:10,210 --> 01:39:14,950
I really would like to hold off to fight
the champion because I feel like any

1700
01:39:14,951 --> 01:39:19,600
other fight is going to either take
me down or keep me in the same spot.

1701
01:39:21,490 --> 01:39:26,410
So I don't know what they're planning
on doing with Tatiana and Nina,

1702
01:39:27,250 --> 01:39:30,160
but, uh, if they're trying to
give them a shot before me,

1703
01:39:30,161 --> 01:39:33,640
I feel like I want the winner of that
and let me in them, hash it out to,

1704
01:39:33,641 --> 01:39:34,570
to fight for the belt.

1705
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:39,750
Hmm. So that would be what you would
do as a second choice. First Choice.

1706
01:39:39,751 --> 01:39:41,900
Does he want to fight for the belt?
Second choices,

1707
01:39:41,901 --> 01:39:43,430
whoever's going to fight for the belt.
Let me fight her.

1708
01:39:43,490 --> 01:39:46,970
Let me find them first because
Tatiana only had seven fights.

1709
01:39:46,971 --> 01:39:49,640
Nothing against her. Like she's,
you know, she's pled her case.

1710
01:39:50,200 --> 01:39:53,170
I have three times the money
fights as she does. You know,

1711
01:39:53,180 --> 01:39:55,460
I've fought for about four.
I've been a champion before.

1712
01:39:55,461 --> 01:40:00,380
I've gone five rounds before I fought
main event before I've worked my way back

1713
01:40:00,381 --> 01:40:03,410
up. Give me a shot. Let me be mom champ.

1714
01:40:06,360 --> 01:40:09,430
Yeah. You gotta get there before somebody
else does. Right. That's what I'm saying.

1715
01:40:09,880 --> 01:40:13,510
Cause the only other person in that,
well, cats and Ghana, you know, I mean,

1716
01:40:13,600 --> 01:40:15,430
I don't know how our
eyeballs doing right now.

1717
01:40:15,940 --> 01:40:20,440
I know that was a crazy situation to have
all those fights in the UFC and never

1718
01:40:20,441 --> 01:40:23,860
have someone get towed in the, I like
that before. And obviously, you know,

1719
01:40:23,861 --> 01:40:25,720
that's how Winkeljohn Boston's vision.
Yeah.

1720
01:40:25,760 --> 01:40:27,410
Yeah. It's scary. Yeah.

1721
01:40:27,500 --> 01:40:31,610
It is really scary to think that this
is what we do and that there's very,

1722
01:40:31,910 --> 01:40:33,920
there's so many dangerous.
Yeah.

1723
01:40:34,510 --> 01:40:36,490
I mean you,
you're in a while business lady.

1724
01:40:36,530 --> 01:40:41,300
Yeah. But I, I mean, I wouldn't, I
wouldn't trade it for the world. I just,

1725
01:40:41,320 --> 01:40:43,490
you know,
this is what I love doing so.

1726
01:40:43,960 --> 01:40:48,730
Well that's awesome. Then you're in the
right spot. Well, obviously, you know,

1727
01:40:48,740 --> 01:40:52,000
you ranked number seven in the world
even though it is gotta be frustrating

1728
01:40:52,001 --> 01:40:54,180
though, that you have
gone in rankings. Yeah.

1729
01:40:54,310 --> 01:40:57,900
Yeah. I haven't lost absolutely
100%. And I just, um,

1730
01:40:58,650 --> 01:41:03,650
I don't know why they would argue for
me not to get the belt to go for it.

1731
01:41:04,140 --> 01:41:08,550
You know, everything's there at
the storyline. Is there. Yeah. Um,

1732
01:41:09,330 --> 01:41:13,050
it would be, you know, technique
versus strength, speed versus power.

1733
01:41:14,040 --> 01:41:17,600
This is you and Jessica.
Yeah. Yup. Yeah. And um,

1734
01:41:18,780 --> 01:41:20,110
and like I said, there were, there,

1735
01:41:20,250 --> 01:41:23,550
there were millions of people rallying
behind me because they want to see me,

1736
01:41:23,580 --> 01:41:26,790
you know, get that belt.
And I do too. You know,

1737
01:41:26,791 --> 01:41:31,750
I'd love for my daughter to see that
dream of mine come true and, and uh,

1738
01:41:31,770 --> 01:41:36,270
for her to come in the octagon
with me and be holding that belt,

1739
01:41:36,271 --> 01:41:37,620
I think it would be an amazing moment.

1740
01:41:38,470 --> 01:41:38,711
Yeah.

1741
01:41:38,711 --> 01:41:43,711
It's crazy watching kids see their parents
when titles and how amazing it is to

1742
01:41:45,161 --> 01:41:49,780
them. It's, it's a, it's very
strange thing to see like
that, oh my God, you know,

1743
01:41:49,781 --> 01:41:52,870
my mom is the champ of the world and
my dad's champ, we've never seen it,

1744
01:41:52,871 --> 01:41:56,400
obviously from a woman, but that my
dad's a champion. The world. Yeah.

1745
01:41:56,610 --> 01:41:58,240
It's a very powerful thing.

1746
01:41:58,440 --> 01:42:02,970
Yeah. So you're in a holding pattern
right now, essentially. Yeah,

1747
01:42:03,150 --> 01:42:06,780
that's, that's, that's what we're
doing. Is your last fight? Um,

1748
01:42:06,960 --> 01:42:10,830
was it April, March or April? March
or April. Yeah. We're just working.

1749
01:42:10,831 --> 01:42:14,960
We're getting better. Almost a year.
No, this April, this April two.

1750
01:42:14,970 --> 01:42:19,680
What am I talking about? Yeah. I
thought I thought Carolina cleavage.

1751
01:42:19,710 --> 01:42:23,160
That's right. Yeah. I know.
It was a great fight. Um,

1752
01:42:23,880 --> 01:42:28,750
I wanted to finish, but you can't
force those things, you know? So, uh,

1753
01:42:28,751 --> 01:42:32,390
I just going to continue to do what I'm
doing and continue to get better. And

1754
01:42:32,560 --> 01:42:36,280
what'd you think of her loss to on drudge?
That was crazy.

1755
01:42:36,530 --> 01:42:41,530
I feel like styles make fights
and it was the perfect fight for,

1756
01:42:42,730 --> 01:42:47,730
and Raj to showcase her knockout power
because K K is a pressure fighter and she

1757
01:42:49,251 --> 01:42:54,251
instinctively will go forward and throw
when she is in danger and sometimes it

1758
01:42:55,041 --> 01:42:58,070
works and sometimes it
doesn't, you know? Yeah.

1759
01:42:59,540 --> 01:43:03,770
And she throws hard, obviously
she put, um, you ana, you know,

1760
01:43:03,800 --> 01:43:07,790
she buckled you on a couple of times.
She's dangerous. She's, she won.

1761
01:43:08,060 --> 01:43:11,690
She won against rose.
Yeah. You know, so, um,

1762
01:43:13,100 --> 01:43:17,360
but yeah,
I think styles make fights and um,

1763
01:43:18,190 --> 01:43:22,670
that's, that's what happened with her
in that situation. What do you think?

1764
01:43:23,180 --> 01:43:27,350
Entourages unusually strong.
Yeah. Look Freakish. No.

1765
01:43:27,360 --> 01:43:30,330
Like you see when she grabs a hold of
people and then dumps them on their ass,

1766
01:43:30,331 --> 01:43:31,164
like she's,

1767
01:43:31,410 --> 01:43:36,410
she's freakishly powerful to be able to
like hit that single and elevate a rose

1768
01:43:37,801 --> 01:43:38,880
that way and drop on her head.

1769
01:43:39,060 --> 01:43:43,610
When you think about how strong you have
to be to do that, it's beautiful. Yeah.

1770
01:43:43,710 --> 01:43:47,600
Beautiful to watch. Um, she's a
beast. Great technique as well. No,

1771
01:43:47,601 --> 01:43:50,940
no doubt about it. But man, a
lot of dollar bottle horsepower,

1772
01:43:51,080 --> 01:43:52,030
that's her bread and butter.
And

1773
01:43:52,030 --> 01:43:56,810
I, and I figured, I honestly, I gave
it to rose to win the fight. Um,

1774
01:43:58,130 --> 01:44:02,300
it only takes a split second though to
lose your focus and to get picked up and

1775
01:44:02,301 --> 01:44:05,030
slammed it down like that.
And then the fights over,

1776
01:44:05,160 --> 01:44:05,480
you know,

1777
01:44:05,480 --> 01:44:08,880
the division is actually probably good
because it's exciting because it mixes

1778
01:44:08,881 --> 01:44:12,000
things up a bit. You have Yolanda who
is the dominant champion for so long.

1779
01:44:12,001 --> 01:44:13,040
Rows comes on to Pete's,

1780
01:44:13,050 --> 01:44:17,520
her and then Jessica dumps rose in her
head and beats her and a fight that she

1781
01:44:17,521 --> 01:44:20,580
was losing. I mean there's like,
it's a hotbed of talent. It's really,

1782
01:44:20,581 --> 01:44:24,630
it's 115 pound women's division is
amazing right now. There really is.

1783
01:44:24,710 --> 01:44:29,360
Yeah. Yeah. And um, so
that's what I'm wanting.

1784
01:44:29,480 --> 01:44:33,350
That's exactly what I want. And
uh, in the meantime we just,

1785
01:44:33,380 --> 01:44:36,290
we just get better and beautiful way.
We train and we get better.

1786
01:44:36,860 --> 01:44:39,980
We feel like what's going
to be on Androgel is, um,

1787
01:44:40,730 --> 01:44:44,570
I mean rose had rose was doing
exactly what she's doing.

1788
01:44:44,571 --> 01:44:48,370
I think that role is actually
kind of got a bit just to,

1789
01:44:48,390 --> 01:44:52,850
as a little bit complacent and in
like, she, she's even said it herself.

1790
01:44:52,851 --> 01:44:55,070
It was a moment of,
of laziness.

1791
01:44:56,380 --> 01:45:00,900
Yeah. And I mean so hard after the fact
to try to figure out what went wrong,

1792
01:45:00,910 --> 01:45:02,920
why it went wrong,
what was going on in her head,

1793
01:45:02,921 --> 01:45:06,580
but clearly it was not lacing up the
legs when she's attacking the Camorra

1794
01:45:06,970 --> 01:45:08,050
elevated and dumped

1795
01:45:08,390 --> 01:45:12,960
and, and, and I'm sure for
a lot of her camp she's,

1796
01:45:13,140 --> 01:45:14,970
she was able to do that with um,

1797
01:45:15,390 --> 01:45:19,290
with her teammates and eat probably
pop off good submissions, you know,

1798
01:45:19,291 --> 01:45:24,291
but in the moment of a fight
for a championship belts
in your hometown against

1799
01:45:25,920 --> 01:45:30,420
the person that's bread and
butter is a pile drive, you know,

1800
01:45:30,540 --> 01:45:33,660
it,
it's just like stacks up against you

1801
01:45:33,770 --> 01:45:36,650
for sure. Well good luck trying to
find someone as strong as val is,

1802
01:45:36,651 --> 01:45:40,340
her outside of me, Valentino
who she does train with. I mean,

1803
01:45:40,341 --> 01:45:43,760
but Jessica and Raj is probably one of
the strongest women in the 150 pound

1804
01:45:43,761 --> 01:45:45,380
division.
She's so damn strong.

1805
01:45:45,410 --> 01:45:47,970
So good luck trying to find
someone to replicate that.

1806
01:45:48,030 --> 01:45:48,780
The training,

1807
01:45:48,780 --> 01:45:53,580
you don't train that you
don't train the pile driver.

1808
01:45:53,820 --> 01:45:57,870
Like that's dangerous. That's one of those
things that you just, I don't, I don't,

1809
01:45:59,080 --> 01:46:00,400
she does train of Valentino though.

1810
01:46:00,401 --> 01:46:03,910
Who's one of the strongest
women at 125 Valentino's a tank.

1811
01:46:04,410 --> 01:46:05,590
That's a very strong one.

1812
01:46:05,620 --> 01:46:07,440
But her style is different
too. Yeah, she's a,

1813
01:46:07,550 --> 01:46:11,080
she's a counter fighter and she picks
and chooses when she wants to go and if

1814
01:46:11,081 --> 01:46:13,010
she holds you down.
Yeah.

1815
01:46:13,011 --> 01:46:17,590
Like her take downs or not unjudged
his take downs. Right. You know,

1816
01:46:17,680 --> 01:46:20,350
so I don't know.
We'll see.

1817
01:46:20,460 --> 01:46:23,640
It is one of the things that's so exciting
about the sport is that there are so

1818
01:46:23,641 --> 01:46:26,400
many different ways to approach it.
There's so many different ways.

1819
01:46:26,401 --> 01:46:30,300
Here's your way, karate
style. There's you on his way.

1820
01:46:30,301 --> 01:46:32,580
Moitai you know there's something,

1821
01:46:32,581 --> 01:46:36,300
there's Jessica's way bulldog get ahold
of you. Take her down and you know,

1822
01:46:36,301 --> 01:46:39,830
in a lot of ways you'll want to also show
how to beat Jessica was Raj, you know,

1823
01:46:39,940 --> 01:46:40,800
she showed her the beat here.

1824
01:46:41,010 --> 01:46:44,350
I just, I feel the difference
with Johan and rose is that

1825
01:46:45,880 --> 01:46:50,190
rose, because this is
just my opinion, rose has,

1826
01:46:51,460 --> 01:46:56,250
it has shown to have more variety in her,

1827
01:46:57,480 --> 01:47:00,810
in her toolbox. She's this really
good grappling and this and that,

1828
01:47:00,811 --> 01:47:03,180
that I don't think she's as,

1829
01:47:04,170 --> 01:47:07,640
she's not a hazard as hesitant to go
to the ground. I feel like if, if,

1830
01:47:08,300 --> 01:47:09,720
if the situation allowed it,

1831
01:47:09,721 --> 01:47:13,140
she would go to the ground and even
get a submission on, on drudge.

1832
01:47:13,170 --> 01:47:17,340
Whereas with [inaudible],
she knows what she has to do to win,

1833
01:47:17,341 --> 01:47:21,150
and she'll be stubborn in that
sense and do that for five minutes,

1834
01:47:21,151 --> 01:47:25,080
for five rounds consistently.
You know what I mean?

1835
01:47:25,650 --> 01:47:30,030
And I feel like with
rose, she's, she will,

1836
01:47:30,031 --> 01:47:34,680
she'll take risks and, and a lot of
times it does work for her, you know?

1837
01:47:34,681 --> 01:47:36,390
And sometimes it just doesn't.

1838
01:47:37,460 --> 01:47:39,870
Yeah. And that was just one
of those times. Yeah. Just,

1839
01:47:40,130 --> 01:47:44,030
it's interesting to see her talk
about fighting in peer period,

1840
01:47:44,031 --> 01:47:46,010
that she doesn't know if
she has that in her anymore,

1841
01:47:46,280 --> 01:47:48,710
just to be mean to a
person to hurt a person.

1842
01:47:48,920 --> 01:47:50,860
But I thought that was really interesting.
Yes.

1843
01:47:50,940 --> 01:47:54,240
Yeah, I love how honest she
is, but I also feel like

1844
01:47:55,890 --> 01:48:00,360
a big part of her getting the belt
was to know that she could, you know,

1845
01:48:00,361 --> 01:48:03,720
to know that she could take down,
you honor the invincible, you know?

1846
01:48:03,810 --> 01:48:07,860
And then she did that and
then it was like, all right,
well now I know that I can,

1847
01:48:07,920 --> 01:48:09,450
and it's kind of like, well, I've already,

1848
01:48:10,500 --> 01:48:13,500
I've already accomplished what I
wanted to accomplish. I don't know.

1849
01:48:13,501 --> 01:48:17,010
Maybe that's just me thinking out loud
of what maybe she might be going through.

1850
01:48:17,040 --> 01:48:19,110
What might be going on in her mind,
you know,

1851
01:48:19,210 --> 01:48:22,840
let's say if you fought on drudge and
you beat her and you become the champion,

1852
01:48:22,841 --> 01:48:27,070
would that take a significant amount of
motivation away from you or would you

1853
01:48:27,071 --> 01:48:28,960
have more motivation to defend it?

1854
01:48:30,010 --> 01:48:31,240
So we'll talk about this too,

1855
01:48:31,241 --> 01:48:35,740
because that's been such a huge
goal of mine is to be the champ.

1856
01:48:35,800 --> 01:48:39,490
Um, and I, I want to say two fights ago,

1857
01:48:39,520 --> 01:48:42,670
we started implementing,
um,

1858
01:48:44,440 --> 01:48:49,000
visualizations of me being the champ and
defending the belt and how that would

1859
01:48:49,001 --> 01:48:53,080
look like, you know, and, um,
does with your psychologist.

1860
01:48:53,710 --> 01:48:57,940
With my sports psychologist
and um, yeah, so that,

1861
01:48:59,320 --> 01:49:04,060
that makes the mountain higher. You
know, it's like, it's not the end game.

1862
01:49:04,061 --> 01:49:06,850
Once you get the belt. And coach
Jackson would say that all the time.

1863
01:49:07,360 --> 01:49:09,910
It's easy to become the champ.
It's harder to stay the champ.

1864
01:49:10,540 --> 01:49:14,740
No, Charlie is, well, listen,
Michelle, you're very entertaining.

1865
01:49:14,800 --> 01:49:17,860
I love Washington fight.
I hope if you do get the Cha,

1866
01:49:18,070 --> 01:49:21,290
the chance of fight for the title,
that I'll be there to call it. And uh,

1867
01:49:21,340 --> 01:49:23,840
thanks for doing this. I really appreciate
it. Thank you so much for having me.

1868
01:49:23,930 --> 01:49:27,070
[inaudible] everybody get a chance to
get to know you. Thank you Michelle.

1869
01:49:27,071 --> 01:49:29,800
Waterson ladies, gentlemen, bye everybody.
