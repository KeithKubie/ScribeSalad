00:00:06.099 --> 00:00:06.109
 
 

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:08.509
 
okay all right what the hell

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519
okay all right what the hell
 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.520
okay all right what the hell
address the Jewish Question that's a

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530
address the Jewish Question that's a
 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:11.780
address the Jewish Question that's a
hell of a thing to ask

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790
hell of a thing to ask
 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.910
hell of a thing to ask
so that's Jaqueline turn you know I mean

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920
so that's Jaqueline turn you know I mean
 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.289
so that's Jaqueline turn you know I mean
really that's a hell of a thing to ask

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299
really that's a hell of a thing to ask
 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.870
really that's a hell of a thing to ask
but I will say something about it you

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880
but I will say something about it you
 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.460
but I will say something about it you
know and I've thought about this a lot

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470
know and I've thought about this a lot
 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.700
know and I've thought about this a lot
so there is evidence that ask a nosy

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710
so there is evidence that ask a nosy
 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.439
so there is evidence that ask a nosy
Jews so those are Jews of European

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449
Jews so those are Jews of European
 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.630
Jews so those are Jews of European
heritage have IQs that are about 15

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640
heritage have IQs that are about 15
 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:27.740
heritage have IQs that are about 15
points higher than the population

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750
points higher than the population
 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.380
points higher than the population
average so that's a lot 15 points it's

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390
average so that's a lot 15 points it's
 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.999
average so that's a lot 15 points it's
about the average difference between the

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009
about the average difference between the
 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.319
about the average difference between the
typical high school student and the

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329
typical high school student and the
 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.479
typical high school student and the
typical state college student it's a lot

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489
typical state college student it's a lot
 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.090
typical state college student it's a lot
and one of the things that means is so

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100
and one of the things that means is so
 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.860
and one of the things that means is so
imagine there's two distributions and

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870
imagine there's two distributions and
 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.420
imagine there's two distributions and
that they overlap and that the Jewish

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430
that they overlap and that the Jewish
 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.790
that they overlap and that the Jewish
one is is the the mean is as one 15 so

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800
one is is the the mean is as one 15 so
 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.770
one is is the the mean is as one 15 so
the whole distribution is shifted to the

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780
the whole distribution is shifted to the
 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.869
the whole distribution is shifted to the
right what that means is if you go up

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879
right what that means is if you go up
 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.740
right what that means is if you go up
into the higher IQ strata 131 45 way the

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750
into the higher IQ strata 131 45 way the
 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.779
into the higher IQ strata 131 45 way the
hell up there that Jewish people are

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789
hell up there that Jewish people are
 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.819
hell up there that Jewish people are
overwhelmingly over-represented at the

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829
overwhelmingly over-represented at the
 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.040
overwhelmingly over-represented at the
high end of the IQ distribution now the

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050
high end of the IQ distribution now the
 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.750
high end of the IQ distribution now the
price they pay for that is some

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760
price they pay for that is some
 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.880
price they pay for that is some
increased propensity for neurological

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890
increased propensity for neurological
 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.890
increased propensity for neurological
diseases that seems to be associated in

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900
diseases that seems to be associated in
 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.109
diseases that seems to be associated in
some sense with that heightened IQ now

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119
some sense with that heightened IQ now
 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.820
some sense with that heightened IQ now
you know the science on this isn't

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830
you know the science on this isn't
 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.130
you know the science on this isn't
settled but but it's reasonably solid

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140
settled but but it's reasonably solid
 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.050
settled but but it's reasonably solid
you know given the standards of such

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060
you know given the standards of such
 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.340
you know given the standards of such
things okay so Jews are gonna be

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350
things okay so Jews are gonna be
 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.210
things okay so Jews are gonna be
over-represented at the high end of

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220
over-represented at the high end of
 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.880
over-represented at the high end of
cognitively complex disciplines so then

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890
cognitively complex disciplines so then
 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.010
cognitively complex disciplines so then
I would say and that's the case like

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020
I would say and that's the case like
 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.870
I would say and that's the case like
their way over-represented among like

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880
their way over-represented among like
 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.880
their way over-represented among like
outstanding scientists and among Nobel

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890
outstanding scientists and among Nobel
 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.240

Prize winners and and so forth and so
 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.679
Prize winners and and so forth and so
you know people look and they think well

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689
you know people look and they think well
 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.960
you know people look and they think well
why are there a disproportionate number

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970
why are there a disproportionate number
 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.730
why are there a disproportionate number
of Jewish people in positions of

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740
of Jewish people in positions of
 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.170
of Jewish people in positions of
authority and they say well it must be a

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180
authority and they say well it must be a
 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.499
authority and they say well it must be a
conspiracy you know it must be systemic

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509
conspiracy you know it must be systemic
 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.600
conspiracy you know it must be systemic
in some sense it's like no it can be

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610
in some sense it's like no it can be
 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.910
in some sense it's like no it can be
simply accounted for by that relatively

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920
simply accounted for by that relatively
 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.469
simply accounted for by that relatively
large IQ differential

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479
large IQ differential
 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.020
large IQ differential
now the next criticism would be well

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030
now the next criticism would be well
 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.719
now the next criticism would be well
don't the Jews tend to lean left

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729
don't the Jews tend to lean left
 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.880
don't the Jews tend to lean left
well first you might say well you know

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890
well first you might say well you know
 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.179
well first you might say well you know
given what happened in in Nazi Germany

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:01.189
given what happened in in Nazi Germany
 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:03.499
given what happened in in Nazi Germany
to the degree that that was right-wing

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509
to the degree that that was right-wing
 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.149
to the degree that that was right-wing
as we discussed earlier that's the

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159
as we discussed earlier that's the
 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.830
as we discussed earlier that's the
nationalism and ethnocentrism it's

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840
nationalism and ethnocentrism it's
 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.529
nationalism and ethnocentrism it's
hardly surprising that they might you

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539
hardly surprising that they might you
 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.360
hardly surprising that they might you
know in this historical period of time

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370
know in this historical period of time
 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.559
know in this historical period of time
tend to move towards the left

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569
tend to move towards the left
 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.220
tend to move towards the left
but more importantly than that IQ is

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230
but more importantly than that IQ is
 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.289
but more importantly than that IQ is
associated with trade openness and trade

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:19.299
associated with trade openness and trade
 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:21.390
associated with trade openness and trade
openness is a strong predictor predictor

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400
openness is a strong predictor predictor
 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.839
openness is a strong predictor predictor
of political liberalism so and it's the

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:24.849
of political liberalism so and it's the
 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:26.250
of political liberalism so and it's the
strongest predictor of political

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260
strongest predictor of political
 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.059
strongest predictor of political
liberalism so you know it's very

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069
liberalism so you know it's very
 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:31.679
liberalism so you know it's very
difficult so that's what I have to say

00:02:31.679 --> 00:02:31.689
difficult so that's what I have to say
 

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:33.089
difficult so that's what I have to say
about that it's like and the other thing

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:33.099
about that it's like and the other thing
 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:35.599
about that it's like and the other thing
I would say is you know the fact that

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:35.609
I would say is you know the fact that
 

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:38.520
I would say is you know the fact that
there's a population as sub population

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530
there's a population as sub population
 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.409
there's a population as sub population
of people who are much smarter than

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:40.419
of people who are much smarter than
 

00:02:40.419 --> 00:02:43.440
of people who are much smarter than
average not on average right on average

I've you gotta get that straight on

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430
I've you gotta get that straight on
 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.729
I've you gotta get that straight on
average is actually of great benefit to

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739
average is actually of great benefit to
 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:49.770
average is actually of great benefit to
the rest of us because what do you want

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780
the rest of us because what do you want
 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.860
the rest of us because what do you want
fewer geniuses fewer people with IQs of

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870
fewer geniuses fewer people with IQs of
 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.119
fewer geniuses fewer people with IQs of
145 or 160 that's and you know and it's

00:02:57.119 --> 00:02:57.129
145 or 160 that's and you know and it's
 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:59.879
145 or 160 that's and you know and it's
no conspiracy that puts people who are

no conspiracy that puts people who are
smarter higher up in competence

smarter higher up in competence
hierarchies because IQs the best

I've addressed the Jewish Question it's

00:03:10.649 --> 00:03:10.659
I've addressed the Jewish Question it's
 

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:12.750
I've addressed the Jewish Question it's
like it's a confusion between ethnicity

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760
like it's a confusion between ethnicity
 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.500
like it's a confusion between ethnicity
and and IQ as far as I'm concerned so

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510
and and IQ as far as I'm concerned so
 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.749

I'll probably get like painted six

00:03:18.749 --> 00:03:18.759
I'll probably get like painted six
 

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:20.249
I'll probably get like painted six
different shades of black for that

00:03:20.249 --> 00:03:20.259

different shades of black for that
answer but it's I've thought about a

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269
answer but it's I've thought about a
 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:23.849
answer but it's I've thought about a
long time it's the best that I can
