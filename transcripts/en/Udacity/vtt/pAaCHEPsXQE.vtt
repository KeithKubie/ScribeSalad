00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:01.650
The hypotenuse is 10.

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.408
We can plug 6 and 8 in for a and
b, and we're solving for c.

00:00:06.408 --> 00:00:09.368
6 squared + 8 squared
will give us a c squared.

00:00:09.368 --> 00:00:11.446
6 squared is 36.

00:00:11.446 --> 00:00:13.930
8 squared is 64.

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:18.140
And we add those together to get 100,
which equals c squared.

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.180
Let's take the square
root of both sides.

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.099
And the square root of 100 is 10,
so c is equal to 10.
