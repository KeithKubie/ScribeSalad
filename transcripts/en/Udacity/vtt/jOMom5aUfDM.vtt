00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:01.830
All right,
let's start from the beginning.

00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:04.970
With this action,
we edit and save a README.

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:07.692
This change will only affect
the working directory.

00:00:07.692 --> 00:00:10.280
All right, what about this one,
git add README?

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.300
This will take the change from
the working directory and

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.760
add it to the staging area.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.670
So, the staging area will be changed.

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:16.980
Then we have git commit.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.330
Running git commit will create a commit
with the changes from the staging area

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.560
and update the master branch.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:24.130
Okay.

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.030
So, what about git pull origin master?

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:30.380
This will take the commit currently
in the master branch on GitHub and

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.880
pull it into the local branch and merge
it into what's currently on master.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.850
So, the local master is
the only thing that changes.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.830
Now we have git push origin master.

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:44.820
This will take what's in the local
version and push it to the remote.

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.910
So this operation just
changes the remote.

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:48.900
Okay, down to the last one.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:53.400
If we have a pull request to merge
the alt branch into master, and

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.825
that pull request gets accepted and
merged in,

00:00:55.825 --> 00:00:59.448
then the alt branch will
get merged with master.

00:00:59.448 --> 00:01:02.070
So the GitHub master branch is
the only thing that will get updated.
