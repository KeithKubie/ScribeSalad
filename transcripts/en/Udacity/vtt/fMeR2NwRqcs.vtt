00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The denominator has M₁ either + or - M₂. Well, it can't be minus.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Otherwise, if these masses were equal, you get 0 in the denominator. I don't like dividing by 0.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Next, let's talk about this box. Should that be a +  or -?

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Well, if it was plus sign, this numerator would always be positive.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
That would indicate it would always accelerate in this direction, no matter what.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
But clearly, if this guy is huge and this mass is really tiny, it should accelerate the other way.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Since negative acceleration is possible, this better be a minus sign.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
In fact, when will negative acceleration happen?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
When this term is really huge. Or putting it another way, when this term is really huge.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
That means, this box then will have a 1.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
To figure out what goes in this box, let's imagine the limiting case for this mass is 0.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Well, if this mass is 0, we just have a block on an inclined plane.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
And in the lesson I just gave you on inclined planes,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
you saw the acceleration in that case should be g sin α.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Well, if we make this a 2, well the M₁'s are both 0.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
M₂'s will cancel out, and with a = g sin α. It works. Very nice.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
This sort of thinking is the one we do all the time in Physics,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and if you're able to get this right, it means you have a very strong physics intuition already.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
If you weren't able to get it right on your first guess, that's no problem either.

00:01:09.000 --> 99:59:59.000
This intuition takes a while to build. Don't worry, that's one of the things this class is for.
