00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:05.050
Over which interval does y
of x have an average rate

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:07.779
of change of negative 4?

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:09.820
So average rate of change,
if you think about it,

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:11.250
you are literally just
averaging for example,

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.110
in this bowl section
right over here.

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.700
The slope is really,
really steep.

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:15.690
It gets less steep.

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.580
It's a very negative slope,
it gets less negative.

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.290
Less negative slope is 0 here.

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:23.830
Then it gets positive, more
positive, and more positive,

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:25.080
and more positive.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.038
But when you get to this
point right over here,

00:00:27.038 --> 00:00:30.530
you see you got to
where you started from.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:34.950
One you could say the
net change has been 0.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.060
And any interval over which
the net change has been 0 also

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.470
tells you that the average rate
of change is going to be 0.

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.640
So you could view that
the average rate of change

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.550
is really the slope
of the line that

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.250
connects the two endpoints
of your interval.

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.570
So another way of asking
over which interval

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.430
does y of x have an average
rate of change of negative 4

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.350
is, can you come
up with an interval

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.330
where the slope between the
endpoints of the interval

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.447
is negative 4?

00:01:05.447 --> 00:01:07.030
So let's see the
choices they give us.

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.040
This first interval is x is
between negative 1 and 1.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.430
So x is between negative 1.

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:14.920
So this is x is negative 1.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.700
When x is equal to negative 1,
y of x is all the way over here.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.180
y of negative 1 is equal to 7.

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:27.710
And then when x is equal to 1,
our graph is down over here.

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.610
y of 1 is negative 1.

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.830
So what is the slope
of the line that

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.090
connects the endpoints
of those two points?

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:39.910
So what is the
slope of this line?

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:41.850
Because the slope of
this line, the line that

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.000
connects the endpoints
of my interval,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.430
that is going to be the
average rate of change

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.050
over this interval.

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.540
And you see very clearly
that the slope here,

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.960
the rate of change of y with
respect to x is negative 4.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.660
Every time we move one
ahead in the x direction,

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.200
we move down four
in the y direction.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.050
Move one ahead in
the x direction,

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.580
we move down four
in the y direction.

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.800
So the average rate of
change over this interval

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:09.949
is negative 4.

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:12.000
So we didn't have to even
look at anything else,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.380
that one will work.
