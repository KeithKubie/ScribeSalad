Thank you for sharing your answer. Now that

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:05.670
we've used classes for the very first time,

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.790
I want to highlight something that took me

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:09.920
a really long time to understand when I

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.560
was in college. When we wanted to use

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:18.320
functions previously, we wrote code like webbrowser.open(). But

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.430
when we wanted to create instances of this

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.755
class, class turtle, we wrote code that said,

00:00:23.755 --> 00:00:27.280
turtle.Turtle(). Now, look at both of these

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:31.070
statements. They look rather similar. It seems

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.750
like we're calling a function in both of these cases. But something different is

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.685
happening behind the scene. When we call

00:00:38.685 --> 00:00:41.810
webbrowser.open(), all we are doing is calling

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:44.660
a function. No big deal. But when

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.830
we call turtle.Turtle, the init function defined

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:51.540
inside class Turtle, that's the function that gets

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.100
called. And it creates or initializes space inside

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.490
memory for a new instance which we called

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.450
brad. Even though it seems like we called

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.450
functions in both cases, we called open in

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.100
the first case and the function init, in

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.430
the second case. Not all functions are created

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:14.210
equal. When we called webbrowser.open(), all we did was

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.870
call a function, but when we called turtle.Turtle(), it in turned

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:23.530
called the init function which created or initialized space in memory

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.030
that did not exist before. So, that concludes our first example

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.190
of how to use classes. Let's look at a few more examples.
