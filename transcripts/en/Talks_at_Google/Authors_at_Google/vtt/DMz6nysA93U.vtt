&gt;&gt; Female Interviewer: Please join me in welcoming
author and journalist Jennifer Egan to Google

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:14.100
Cambridge for today's Authors at Google's
event.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:20.570
Her most recent novel A Visit from the Goon
Squad is the winner of the 2011 Pulitzer Prize

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:21.570
in fiction.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.890
It also won LA Times Book Prize and the National
Book Critics Circle Award in Fiction.

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.369
She is also the author of Emerald City and
Other Stories, The Keep, and Look at Me which

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:34.930
is a nominee, a nominee for the National Book
Award in 2001.

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:36.780
Jennifer, welcome to Google.

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.010
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: Thank you for having me.

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.710
[applause]
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: So it’s been a year now,

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.260
almost a year since you won the Pulitzer Prize.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:53.201
Can you tell us a little bit more about what
this year has been like for you and sorta

00:00:53.201 --> 00:00:54.201
of the afterglow of winning the prize?

00:00:54.201 --> 00:00:57.170
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: I think, I mean, I still
am not used to the idea that I won it maybe

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.260
I will finally really grab hold of that idea
when someone else wins it.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.539
I’ll say, “No, I won it.”

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:02.539
[laughs]
[laughter]

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:05.810
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: But right now I feel like
it’s still of source of surprise whenever

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.750
I think of it which is sort of great you know
this sort of I feel like it has this Groundhog

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:16.230
Day quality to it where every time I have
to, really sort of persuade myself that it’s

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:17.230
real.

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:21.479
I think that in terms of just kind of how
it’s changed the structure of my life it’s

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.549
mostly that I’ve had the opportunity to
find a lot of readers for the first time which

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:27.119
is really a thrill.

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.070
And, well, it’s you know I could easily
have said, “I’ve done enough for this

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.229
book; I’m now gonna move on to my next.”

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:40.479
I made the choice to spend quite a bit of
time really trying to capitalize on the opportunity

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:42.590
to keep finding new readers.

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.570
So what that means is that I’ve done a lot
of talking--

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.680
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: in the last year and not

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.840
a whole lot of writing.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.369
But again that was that was a choice on my
part and I think one reason I made that choice

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.609
is that this isn’t my first book.

00:01:55.609 --> 00:02:02.009
I know that this kind of thing happens exceedingly
rarely, usually never in a career.

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:07.670
And because my work is often not really perceived
as all of that mainstream, I just don't presume

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.500
that I'm gonna have a chance like this again.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.180
In fact, I would say that I presume that I
won't, so I wanna make sure that I really

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.250
do everything I can to find as many readers
as I can with this book that surprisingly

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.860
and against my own predictions has found such
wide audience and see if I can hold on to

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.810
some of them [chuckles] for the next few books,
if I ever write them.

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.700
[laughs]
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: That seems like a good strategy

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.000
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: [chuckles] We’ll see we’ll
only know a few years from now-

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.660
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: [chuckles]
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: if I’m still talking about

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.330
Good Squad in five years, we’ll l know the
strategy didn’t pay off-

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.100
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: [laughs]
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: quite as I had hoped.

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.250
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: [laughs]
[laughter]

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.100
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: But when you were awarded the
Pulitzer, judges called the novel an 'inventive

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.390
investigation of growing up and growing old
in the digital age, displaying a big hearted

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.140
curiosity about cultural change at warp speed'.

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.710
I’m curious how do you think the digital
age is changing us as readers, as writers

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:02.270
what do you make of that sort of literature
in that context?

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:06.980
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: I mean, in terms of how it’s
changing us in a big way it’s such a big

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.901
question I don't know if I can answer that
head on.

00:03:08.901 --> 00:03:13.920
I know that, I think that the aspect of that
question that I was thinking about consciously

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.890
as I worked on Good Squad was the relationship
between the digital and our perception of

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:19.920
time.

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.060
And I think one thing that I was thinking
about is the fact that we are much more aware

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.540
of the speed at which time passes, because
of technology, I think.

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.580
Because of how quickly technology becomes
obsolete.

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:36.450
So for example when I was growing up, by the
time I reached my early twenties, the only

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:41.830
real communications event that had occurred
technologically was the invention of the answering

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:47.010
machine which actually was sort of a big deal
because before that you had no way of knowing

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:48.660
that anyone had actually called you.

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:49.660
[chuckle]
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: [chuckle]

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.120
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: And if you got a busy signal
there were, well I guess call waiting would

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.810
be the other one.

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:58.410
So if you think about that from zero to twenty
one.

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:03.790
The answering machine and call waiting being
the only two real communications developments

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.730
that kind of allowed me to mark change.

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.880
And then think about nowadays, a person who
is twenty one and what they’ve witness in

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.450
terms of technological evolution.

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:19.380
And the surprising outcome of that it seems
to me is that all of us have a since of being

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:25.750
behind even much younger people who, that
I would expect to feel really on top of things

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.819
often express a kind of anxiety about people
who are even younger than they are who’ve

00:04:29.819 --> 00:04:33.530
had a slightly different experience that feels
somehow more current because they’ve kind

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:37.710
of come up with whatever technology is predominate
right now.

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.889
And which of course will be totally obsolete
in two or three years.

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:42.639
So I think that’s one thing.

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:50.699
I think it, technology allows us all to feel
the passage of time and I think that may have

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:54.949
benefited this book in ways that I never predicted.

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:58.389
Because when I wrote it I really thought it
would be for people over forty.

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:02.570
Because I thought who is gonna care about
a book about time, what young person would

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:03.969
care about that.

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:08.629
And in fact when I was reading Proust in my
early twenties, a book that really fairly

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:16.030
directly inspired this one and which is very,
right on the surface about time, I felt bored

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:21.510
by everything about the book that referenced
time and that seemed to be steeped in nostalgia

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:24.110
and I just thought who cares.

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:29.120
Time meant nothing to me but what I find interestingly
is that even high school students seem sort

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.789
of interested in time as a subject now.

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:35.810
Is that technologically motivated?

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:36.810
I don't know.

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:41.889
I mean, I think the big question for me in
all of my books to some degree has always

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:49.610
been how is technology changing and shaping
who we are, internally not just in the obvious

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:54.749
ways that we do things differently but how
does it change who were are to ourselves.

00:05:54.749 --> 00:05:57.800
I don’t, I think if I ever really think
I have the answer to that question, I gonna

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.110
have to find a whole new direction to go in--
[chuckles]

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:01.800
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: [chuckles]
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: as a fiction writer I don’t

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.970
really know but it’s extremely fascinating.

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:07.199
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Have you ever thought about
writing science fiction?

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:11.469
Just thinking about so many writers in that
genre play with that concept of time

00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:13.349
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: I haven’t really
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Time travel

00:06:13.349 --> 00:06:19.030
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: I’m not well read in that
genre at all so I would be very nervous about,

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:22.460
striding in there and thinking I could make
any kind of contribution that wouldn't be

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:26.509
stale and repetitive from the point of view
of someone who is really well read in the

00:06:26.509 --> 00:06:27.509
genre.

00:06:27.509 --> 00:06:33.710
I, in a very mild way, I bumbled into it in
Goon Squad, purely because I wanted to visit

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:41.469
a character whom we meet in his early twenties
in around 2007, in middle age, so I didn’t

00:06:41.469 --> 00:06:45.260
really have a lot of options but to go into
the future and I really didn't want to I kept

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.650
thinking there’s gotta be a way around this
maybe I’ll move the whole thing even further

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:54.759
back, so at one point I was sorta moving scenes
from the seventies into the sixties as a way

00:06:54.759 --> 00:06:58.990
of avoid going, avoiding going into the twenty
twenties and then I thought, “no, okay I'm

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:04.029
just gonna have to do it,” and I think and
I found it quiet fun to imagine forward I

00:07:04.029 --> 00:07:05.029
have to say—
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: [hum]

00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:08.249
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: once I had resigned myself
to it.

00:07:08.249 --> 00:07:13.229
It didn’t feel like real science fiction
so I think I wasn’t intimidated in a way

00:07:13.229 --> 00:07:15.389
that I might have been.

00:07:15.389 --> 00:07:22.499
Interestingly, I have sorta, without any real
plans to again ventured more into that realm

00:07:22.499 --> 00:07:25.340
with a shorter piece that I’ve written.

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:30.080
That actually is about a character from Goon
Squad although it’s not, it certainly would

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:37.220
never have fit in this book because I think,
structurally, it’s a shift that’s so radical

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:43.550
that it wouldn’t have really worked in amongst
these the chapters in the book but it is,

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:50.280
I would say it could be more overtly called
sci-fi and it seems to have happened without

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:51.910
my really planning it.

00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:56.539
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Do you have a lot of stories
that didn't make it into Goon Squad, like

00:07:56.539 --> 00:08:01.879
you talk about it being very structurally,
sorta fit together like a puzzle in a lot

00:08:01.879 --> 00:08:02.879
of ways, I found it.

00:08:02.879 --> 00:08:06.659
Were there things that you had to say goodbye
to when you were in the editing process.

00:08:06.659 --> 00:08:12.289
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: Yes, I mean, there were,
it , as I wrote it, it had very I wrote very

00:08:12.289 --> 00:08:16.510
inductively without a clear, it wasn’t that
I had a big clear plan and then I filled in

00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:17.510
the pieces.

00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:22.089
It was more that I. I was interested in someone
and then I would write about them and then

00:08:22.089 --> 00:08:25.849
out of the corner of my eyes, either a time
or a place or a person would catch my eye

00:08:25.849 --> 00:08:31.659
and I would think what was that like and how
can I try to explore that more fully and I,

00:08:31.659 --> 00:08:36.280
and so I moved through the material that way
really guided by my own curiosity, but there

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:41.690
were areas that I was curious about that I
wasn't able to successfully write about.

00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:50.080
I still don't quite know why, it some cases
it was, I had a rule as I worked on the book.

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:55.570
Even though I had such a free flowing approach,
I had decided ahead of time, or once I had

00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:59.610
a few chapters, that each chapter would be
about a different person, each chapter would

00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:04.060
have a totally different mood and tone and
feel, and each chapter would have to stand

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:05.890
completely on its own.

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:10.770
So when I, each time I was working on something,
I was asking myself, can it meet these three

00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:15.140
criteria that was really, that was all I was
asking of each part.

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:20.210
And in the cases of the chapters that didn't
work, they usually failed on all three accounts,

00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:21.210
interestingly.

00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:27.100
It wasn't like, well this is really amazing
and has a great mood and tone and feel but

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:31.810
it doesn't stand on its own so I won’t use
it, it was more like no strong narrative point

00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:37.350
of view, not very compelling or interesting
and only of even the slightest interest because

00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:39.270
of what was around it.

00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:45.590
So, I think in some cases maybe I had some
wrong ideas about characters and so I sorta

00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:47.950
following them into places they didn't want
to go.

00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:52.590
There was one chapter I really wanted to write
in the form of epic poetry and I think to

00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:56.100
this day if I coulda had that and PowerPoint
in one book—

00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:58.510
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: [laughs]
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: it would have been better.

00:09:58.510 --> 00:09:59.510
[laughs]

00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:00.820
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: But I really cannot write

00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:03.380
poetry so, that was a problem.

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:04.380
[laughs]
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: [laughs]

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:06.100
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: And I didn't get far.

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:09.360
[chuckles] And I couldn't do PowerPoint in
the beginning either but that seemed to be

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:10.850
a smaller learning curve.

00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:11.850
[laughs]
[laughter]

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:13.090
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: than epic poetry, so.

00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:17.620
But I was really inspired by great epic poems
I was reading.

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:26.440
One in particular, Don Juan by Byron is just
a rollicking, great story, I mean Don Juan,

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:32.130
goes, has an affair with Catherine of Russia,
joins a harem briefly because he is hiding

00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:33.130
from someone,--
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: [chuckles]

00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:36.330
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: and so he is dressed up as
a girl and then, wouldn't you know it, the

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:38.230
sultan picks him to spend the night with.

00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:39.230
[laughs]
[Laughter]

00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:41.760
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: I mean, there is just such
a great adventure story and but it’s also

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:42.850
very modern.

00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:46.690
Byron is sorta giving little asides to the
reader in complaining about his breakfast

00:10:46.690 --> 00:10:52.350
that day and I thought, I just want to do
that but, I couldn’t do that.

00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:57.770
And then there were others that I struggled
with in one form and ended up using parts

00:10:57.770 --> 00:10:58.770
of in other ways.

00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:04.330
For example, I tried doing PowerPoint using
a different set of characters originally and

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:11.270
that was unsuccessful, I think, partly because
my first thought was who would use PowerPoint

00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:12.310
to tell a story.

00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:18.400
And the most obvious answer is a kind of corporate
person; a person who thinks in PowerPoint

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:20.980
a little bit because they use it at work.

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:26.790
But the problem with that was that it actually
heightened instead of reducing the biggest

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:30.820
problem with PowerPoint as a medium for fiction
which is that it feels very corporate.

00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:35.470
So, me having a corporate person telling a
story about corporate life, didn't exactly

00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:37.150
solve that problem.

00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:43.870
[chuckles] So, but then I found that I held
on to the idea of using PowerPoint and found

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:46.020
a different angle of approach.

00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:51.570
I had also really been interested in pauses
in songs for a long time, and I hadn’t really

00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:55.090
focused a chapter around that but I had kept
trying to slip it in.

00:11:55.090 --> 00:12:00.080
I had an academic writing about pauses in
songs in one failed chapter and then I was

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:03.140
finally able to use that in a bigger way in
the PowerPoint.

00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:08.700
So I never knew why the ones that didn't work
didn’t work, but I definitely knew they

00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:09.700
didn't work.

00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:12.170
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Well, the PowerPoint chapter,
and for those of you who haven't read the

00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:15.380
book you have a real treat to look forward
to at the end.

00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:24.330
It is it is an entire, rich, surprising chapter
about communication between Sasha, --who is

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:30.720
one of the main characters of the story and
written by her son and her daughter--, and

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:32.970
it’s really clever and surprising.

00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:37.730
And I think that, when I came upon that in
the galley that I have here and I didn't know

00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:38.870
it was coming.

00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:43.230
And I was, turned my book around and like,
what is going to happen [chuckles] and you

00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:44.940
really are reading it horizontally.

00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:50.810
And it’s, it really shocked me in a way
not, necessarily for what is there but for

00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:52.770
the ways in which the characters came through.

00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:56.360
Like their voices and that presentation is
just so different.

00:12:56.360 --> 00:13:01.640
I thought it was really a good fit for children
of Sasha to be writing it.

00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:06.730
Just because her life that you read in the,
that unfolds sort of in the previous eleven

00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:12.480
chapters is, it’s really curious and different
and she’s just a very interesting person

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:18.830
so, not to spoil anything for you, but it’s
a great chapter and you did it really well.

00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:20.320
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: Thank you

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:23.590
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: One of the things actually
at the very end of the book there is a sentence

00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:32.120
in that futuristic, near future chapter where
Scotty takes the stage, and I think it’s

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:37.320
Benny who is really reflecting, this is one
of those moments, that people will say they

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:42.040
were at this concert when he just stood up
and did this thing and he said, at that point

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:47.680
he, everyone wanted to own him and he was
sort of a living myth.

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:50.600
And you write, “doesn't a myth belong to
everyone?”

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:54.920
And at that moment, I just felt like that
line sort of just captured so much what this

00:13:54.920 --> 00:14:01.230
book is about and that, time and myth and
through time and memory we acquire our own

00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:04.060
myths and we’re writing them all the time
and we are telling our own stories.

00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:09.170
And do you think that is anything that technology
can touch, I mean, or is that just as old

00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:10.170
as the hills?

00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:11.970
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: That’s an interesting question.

00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:17.930
I’m, I think probably that’s as old as
the hills and yes, technology can touch it.

00:14:17.930 --> 00:14:21.340
I think it’s probably both, I mean, even
that event.

00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:27.390
There’s a prior kind of converging event
in the book which is a disaster.

00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:35.040
Which is that a publicist has this kind of
ultra-hot party at which every who is anyone

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:37.990
in several countries is included.

00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:44.430
And she has this design idea which is that
she hangs these Plexiglas trays with oil and

00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:50.230
colored water in them under bright lights
which warm up the concoction and it swirls

00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:53.040
around and the lights shine through it and
it looks really amazing.

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:58.300
But what she wasn't thinking about was the
fact that the plastic might melt so she ends

00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:02.490
up dumping boiling oil on to all of these
people’s heads and this is really satire.

00:15:02.490 --> 00:15:05.140
It’s not an exploration of overcoming trauma—

00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:06.140
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: [chuckles]

00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:13.450
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: it’s more about sort of,
what it means to be a publicist in some sense,

00:15:13.450 --> 00:15:15.410
and questions like that.

00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:20.440
Anyways, there’s a point where she later,
having gone to jail and gotten out, reflects

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:22.420
on this event and why it was a failure.

00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:26.380
And obviously, in part, is was that she poured
boiling oil on lots of people and ended her

00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:29.800
career and caused a lot of them to get little
scars.

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:35.260
But interestingly the scars become such a
mark of honor because it was so hard to be

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:39.950
included at the party that it later turns
out that lots of people have actually burned

00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:41.320
themselves with oil--

00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:42.320
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: [chuckles]

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:45.330
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: so that it would look later
as though they were at this disastrous party.

00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:50.290
Anyways, she takes a moment to also reflect
on the fact that the party itself was totally

00:15:50.290 --> 00:15:51.290
wrong.

00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:56.110
That it, the timing was wrong, the economy
was about to crash but no one knew it yet.

00:15:56.110 --> 00:16:03.570
That as a publicist not just a designer and
understand and someone who understands chemical

00:16:03.570 --> 00:16:05.390
properties, and how to.

00:16:05.390 --> 00:16:09.360
And she not only failed as an engineer but
she really failed as a publicist to kinda

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:10.770
read the moment.

00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:15.420
And she asks the question, “What will be
the next big convergence, what will be the

00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:17.570
thing that everyone gathers around?”

00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:22.170
And the answer, in the book, and again this
is just meant playfully, I mean it’s fiction

00:16:22.170 --> 00:16:29.600
but the answer ends up being a guy who’s
been a quasi derelict whose completely unplugged

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:35.230
in every way and really off the grid because
he is mentally a little bit fragile.

00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:40.040
He’s very suspicious of companies knowing
a lot about him, an issue I know we’re all

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:41.520
thinking about a lot lately.

00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:42.520
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: [chuckles]

00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:47.290
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: And so, but he is, for very
various reasons, sort of hauled in to do this

00:16:47.290 --> 00:16:52.760
public performance in Downtown Manhattan by
his friend who’s a successful music producer.

00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:57.850
And he is missing a lot of teeth and or a
guess he, his teeth had been repaired by then

00:16:57.850 --> 00:17:03.300
but he stands up and he starts playing this
slide guitar and mostly because of technology

00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:07.510
because all of the people watching it have
all of their own devices this is now in the

00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:08.510
twenty twenties.

00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:13.120
And this entire event was really created through
a kind of harnessing of social networking

00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:17.209
that I’m imagining a few generations beyond
where we are.

00:17:17.209 --> 00:17:22.990
Because of all of the different forces technological
and human and cultural that come to bear on

00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:27.600
this moment, for whatever reason he is kind
of raised a loft as a folk hero.

00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:32.929
And the idea is that this is kind of a huge
seminal moment in the music industry.

00:17:32.929 --> 00:17:36.460
I don't explore what comes after that because
that’s the last chapter.

00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:37.460
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: [laughs]

00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:41.080
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: But that’s the idea that
there is this question about what the next

00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:44.620
moment will be and answer.

00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:48.679
And part of the answer is, has a lot to do
with technology.

00:17:48.679 --> 00:17:55.049
And I guess, mostly the way technology figures
in that moment, two ways; one is everyone

00:17:55.049 --> 00:18:01.460
who is there is there because of technology,
because it’s, an event that’s been powered

00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:06.549
by somewhat surreptitious use of social networking
to get people there.

00:18:06.549 --> 00:18:13.470
But the other reason is that it presumes a
kind of reaction against connectedness that

00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:19.740
makes this man, who is so off the grid and
so unknown, and in a way mysterious, whose

00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:22.590
personal information is not anyone’s but
his own.

00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:26.669
An object of mystery and excitement.

00:18:26.669 --> 00:18:30.570
So I guess those are the two ways that technology
play into that moment.

00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:33.860
&gt;&gt;Interviewer : Do you have a favorite story
in the book?

00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:37.860
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: Not really, actually.

00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:42.170
When it’s, given that I have been talking
about the book now for going on two years.

00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:44.590
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: [chuckles]
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: One nice thing about it is

00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:49.629
because each chapter has its own kind of own
mood and tone and approach, and in a way my

00:18:49.629 --> 00:18:53.350
model there is really a concept album because
the book is so much about the music industry.

00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:59.570
And I love the idea of one story that’s
told in so many different ways that part of

00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:04.090
the fun of it is the collision of these different
styles against each other in the way that

00:19:04.090 --> 00:19:07.190
a concept album is.

00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:12.909
But because each chapter has such a different
mood, I feel like it makes it easier for me

00:19:12.909 --> 00:19:14.529
not get tired of it, personally.

00:19:14.529 --> 00:19:19.150
I can sort of you know if I get tired of reading
one part I can read something totally different;

00:19:19.150 --> 00:19:22.220
it doesn't even sound like it’s part of
the same book.

00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:24.980
So I don’t really, I have to say that I
don’t.

00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:29.289
I have, I would say more that there are a
couple that I never read because I know how

00:19:29.289 --> 00:19:30.730
much trouble I had with them—
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: [chuckles]

00:19:30.730 --> 00:19:34.950
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: and I feel like they kind
of bear the scars, at least for me, their

00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:39.230
very difficult genesis and I’ve sort of
afraid about them.

00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:44.799
I’ve never read Out of Body, not once, because
that was probably the hardest one to write.

00:19:44.799 --> 00:19:50.240
And it seems like I got away with it from
some people's point of view.

00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:55.710
But I know for me, it’s just, it's sort
of a little bit of the problem of the sausage

00:19:55.710 --> 00:19:57.929
factory and having sort of seen it made.

00:19:57.929 --> 00:20:00.809
And feeling like I don't want to push too
hard against this or it just might all fall

00:20:00.809 --> 00:20:01.809
apart.

00:20:01.809 --> 00:20:02.809
[laughs]

00:20:02.809 --> 00:20:06.320
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: [laughs] Have you found that
readers rally around particular stories of

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:12.130
the book or have had chosen favorites or ones
that maybe even they distance themselves from

00:20:12.130 --> 00:20:13.130
more.

00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:16.520
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: It seems like readers often
definitely have favorites.

00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:21.429
One nice thing is that it doesn't really seem
like consensus on which ones those are which

00:20:21.429 --> 00:20:22.860
I’m glad about it.

00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:27.210
It makes me feel like there is kind of something
for everyone there.

00:20:27.210 --> 00:20:31.929
I have found that men tend to think the main
character is Benny, the music producer, and

00:20:31.929 --> 00:20:33.970
women tend to feel that it is Sasha [chuckles]

00:20:33.970 --> 00:20:34.970
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: [chuckles]

00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:36.320
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: his assistant former assistant.

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:41.850
But, I think that my own feeling is that it
really is both of them.

00:20:41.850 --> 00:20:47.360
And so no, it feels like it’s one of those
landscapes that people see very differently

00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:49.340
according to who they are.

00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:52.619
&gt;&gt;Interviewer : And it’s really interesting,
too, when you think about Benny and Sasha

00:20:52.619 --> 00:20:56.671
are the principal charters of the novel but
how their stories unfold.

00:20:56.671 --> 00:21:02.340
And the, all the connections that end up happening
between them is one of delightful things about

00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:03.340
reading this.

00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:07.420
Because especially when I went back to re-read
it I was like, “oh, right, that is how that

00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:11.389
person got into their life and that’s another
bridge between the two.”

00:21:11.389 --> 00:21:17.179
So the timing of it is so elegant and I feel
like it’s almost like it could be staged.

00:21:17.179 --> 00:21:21.600
It’s very purposeful in its timing and it’s
introduction of certain elements.

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:22.769
Was that hard thing to do?

00:21:22.769 --> 00:21:26.360
I mean, how did you line up?

00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:29.950
It is really choreographed I think, is the
only way to say it.

00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:30.950
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: It’s interesting.

00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:36.160
I wrote it, you know as I said it, in this
very inductive, almost impulsive kind of curious

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:37.160
way.

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:42.580
And yet, I had a notion that the timeline
would move backwards and that--.

00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:46.119
I can't say it guided me but maybe in comforted
me because I thought, “well, I’m writing

00:21:46.119 --> 00:21:50.590
it in a very chaotic way but it’s gonna
have a very organized structure once I get

00:21:50.590 --> 00:21:51.590
it all done.”

00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:56.369
Then I had kind of a shock when I because
I spent a long time just working on the chapters

00:21:56.369 --> 00:22:00.100
individually and not working on them together
because I wanted to keep their voices very

00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:01.250
distinct from each other.

00:22:01.250 --> 00:22:06.499
Then I finally sat down and read it and the
backwards order which was supposed to work

00:22:06.499 --> 00:22:07.809
so well.

00:22:07.809 --> 00:22:10.179
And I found that it didn't work at all.

00:22:10.179 --> 00:22:12.970
It was actually really flat and I thought.

00:22:12.970 --> 00:22:15.440
“Okay, so maybe this just isn't gonna work.

00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:19.909
Maybe the second part of this book that I
had hoped would happen, which was kinda combustion

00:22:19.909 --> 00:22:24.500
of these different parts combined, won't happen
and it will just be some parts.”

00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:29.559
But oddly, I actually felt like even the parts
seemed diminished by the whole.

00:22:29.559 --> 00:22:33.230
Which is really the opposite of what you are
hoping for when you’re writing a book.

00:22:33.230 --> 00:22:36.629
It felt like the whole was less than the sum
of the parts.

00:22:36.629 --> 00:22:39.010
And so I thought, why is this happening?

00:22:39.010 --> 00:22:44.399
Is it that it’s just not very good or is
there something deeply wrong about the juxtapositions

00:22:44.399 --> 00:22:46.330
that I have created here?

00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:49.470
And I began to feel that it was the latter
because I felt that like there were all these

00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:56.240
opportunities for surprise and kind of pleasure
for the reader that I was thwarting with my

00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:57.240
backwards order.

00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:59.519
So just to give you one example.

00:22:59.519 --> 00:23:05.409
In the second chapter, the record producer
who is going to hear a band that he’s signed

00:23:05.409 --> 00:23:08.840
to his label.

00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:15.070
He’s thinking about his days as a punk rocker
in the late seventies and it’s two or three

00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:19.629
sentences but you think, hopefully, “huh,
he was a punk rocker, interesting.

00:23:19.629 --> 00:23:21.409
I wonder what that was like?”

00:23:21.409 --> 00:23:26.539
He references a club The Mabuhay Gardens,
which was a very, kind of the epicenter of

00:23:26.539 --> 00:23:29.910
the punk moment in San Francisco in the late
seventies.

00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:32.640
So hopefully the readers had that fleeting
thought.

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:37.649
In my backwards order, I believe, you wait
eight chapters [chuckles] to arrive at Benny

00:23:37.649 --> 00:23:41.799
as a teenager as a punk rocker because we
are waiting for 1979 to come along.

00:23:41.799 --> 00:23:47.779
But in fact, the perfect moment for that chapter
to arrive was immediately the next chapter.

00:23:47.779 --> 00:23:55.200
To basically let the principle of curiosity
which guided me through the material also

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:57.489
informed the reader's experience.

00:23:57.489 --> 00:24:02.289
I think that was what I was kind of missing
that I removed a lot of the fun that I had

00:24:02.289 --> 00:24:09.009
had taking these kind of lateral steps for
the reader by imposing this chronology which

00:24:09.009 --> 00:24:12.010
is just as limiting when it goes backwards
as it is forward.

00:24:12.010 --> 00:24:16.960
So what I realized is that I had to let go
of chronology completely and let curiosity

00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:21.760
and little pleasures and satisfactions be
my guide.

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:26.580
And so those little connections that you talk
about and those little surprises were things

00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:30.950
that started to matter more when I let them
guide me--

00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:32.330
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: [hum]
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: And that was in the end when

00:24:32.330 --> 00:24:38.610
I had to but that really fell into place fairly
late that was shortly before I sold the book

00:24:38.610 --> 00:24:43.360
and that was a big change that really had
to happen.

00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:48.399
&gt;&gt;Interviewer : Well, it’s wonderful it
just really it’s totally what makes it the

00:24:48.399 --> 00:24:49.980
page turner it is.

00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:55.889
In spite of the fact that the plot, the pace
of it changes as you go from story to story.

00:24:55.889 --> 00:24:59.505
But that element is there for every one so
at the end you're just like, 'it’s over

00:24:59.505 --> 00:25:02.000
and now there is no more surprises'.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.450
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: You know one thing

00:25:03.450 --> 00:25:06.539
&gt;&gt;Interviewer : But you can go back and that’s
the thing it’s like you can go back and

00:25:06.539 --> 00:25:07.539
reading it again.

00:25:07.539 --> 00:25:12.149
It’s one of those pleasures where you find,
think about characters differently and moments

00:25:12.149 --> 00:25:17.409
that I had forgotten about come back to me
and are fresh and so I think that having that

00:25:17.409 --> 00:25:25.035
nonlinear sort of approach makes it sort of
unique to read over again.

00:25:25.035 --> 00:25:26.035
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: I’m glad to hear that.

00:25:26.035 --> 00:25:30.989
I think one thing that I find myself saying
to readers sometimes who are a little bit

00:25:30.989 --> 00:25:37.700
confused by the book because it’s not certainly
for a novel very unusually to have no clear

00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:42.470
chronology and to have all of these different
voices and moods and textures.

00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:46.350
But I think some readers feel a little bit
anxious because they feel like there’s some

00:25:46.350 --> 00:25:50.249
bigger picture they should be getting and
might not be getting.

00:25:50.249 --> 00:25:55.679
And I try to do everything I can to make people
not feel that way because really the reason

00:25:55.679 --> 00:26:00.379
I wrote each chapter to stand on its own was
very specifically that I thought if I’m

00:26:00.379 --> 00:26:05.610
asking people to start over thirteen times,
I have to provide a total payoff thirteen

00:26:05.610 --> 00:26:08.649
times, it’s not fair any other way.

00:26:08.649 --> 00:26:13.480
So if you read the book without making a single
connection between the chapters it should

00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:15.179
still be fun.

00:26:15.179 --> 00:26:20.509
And the likelihood is that anyone even reading
it in a not very alert way will make some

00:26:20.509 --> 00:26:25.590
connections and probably wouldn't see all
of them until a second read of course because

00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:27.179
then you know what you are looking for.

00:26:27.179 --> 00:26:29.759
And who cares; I’m not demanding that anyone
read it but once--

00:26:29.759 --> 00:26:30.759
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: [chuckles]

00:26:30.759 --> 00:26:31.759
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: much less twice.

00:26:31.759 --> 00:26:38.000
I mean, my goal really was and always is above
all that it just be fun and hopefully feel

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.190
kind of fresh.

00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:44.179
But I do find myself saying a lot to readers
don't worry and I actually wrote a new introduction

00:26:44.179 --> 00:26:48.759
to book groups that I recently posted myself
on Facebook and put it on my website and also

00:26:48.759 --> 00:26:51.389
the publisher has it on their readers guide.

00:26:51.389 --> 00:26:55.130
Basically just saying this, explaining how
I wrote it and the structure that it has and

00:26:55.130 --> 00:27:00.850
absolving people of anxiety and feeling somehow
there are things they need to get and if they’re

00:27:00.850 --> 00:27:02.629
not doing that they’re missing something.

00:27:02.629 --> 00:27:05.750
Because that’s the last thing I would ever
want anyone to feel.

00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:09.400
&gt;&gt;Interviewer : I like that you mentioned
your website because I wanted to call it out

00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:14.440
as being particularly good author website
and in my line of work I have seen a lot [laughs]

00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:18.470
and some are great and some are really functional.

00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:23.629
But this one I thought was very unique because
you have this sort of timeline for the stories

00:27:23.629 --> 00:27:29.769
where you select moments in your own life,
places you've been, observations you’ve

00:27:29.769 --> 00:27:34.740
had and you use them to introduce each of
the chapters in the book.

00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:38.359
And I was curious why you decided to draw
the curtain back like that.

00:27:38.359 --> 00:27:45.169
Was it tied to that whole Proustian thing,
the unknown element in the lives of other

00:27:45.169 --> 00:27:46.169
people.

00:27:46.169 --> 00:27:49.010
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: Well, I think it began a
little less loftily than that.

00:27:49.010 --> 00:27:51.570
I knew I wanted a different website.

00:27:51.570 --> 00:27:59.159
I felt like the book it had enough technological
savvy about it that the, my old website which

00:27:59.159 --> 00:28:00.240
was basically me grinning--

00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:01.240
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: [chuckles]

00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:03.480
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: and some personal information
seemed insufficient.

00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:08.610
And especially I knew, once I was writing
the PowerPoint chapter, I was worried that

00:28:08.610 --> 00:28:10.690
my publisher wouldn't publish it.

00:28:10.690 --> 00:28:12.350
I thought they’re gonna say you are out
of your mind.

00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:13.830
I wrote it after I had sold the book.

00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:18.429
They thought I was doing light revisions instead
I was creating a seventy-nine slide PowerPoint

00:28:18.429 --> 00:28:20.720
and preparing to wallop them with it.

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:23.970
And I thought what if they say we are not
putting this in and so I thought that’s

00:28:23.970 --> 00:28:24.970
fine.

00:28:24.970 --> 00:28:29.570
I will just have that chapter heading and
a URL address and it will be on my website.

00:28:29.570 --> 00:28:34.139
In fact there is a color version on my website
with a soundtrack that I think is much better.

00:28:34.139 --> 00:28:36.639
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: Anyways, I thought so on

00:28:36.639 --> 00:28:41.720
the grinning face and personal information
was just not a place where this PowerPoint

00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:42.759
could appear.

00:28:42.759 --> 00:28:49.429
It didn't work so I thought okay I have to
find a new take on the website.

00:28:49.429 --> 00:28:52.869
And I’m not that website oriented I don't
look at a lot of websites.

00:28:52.869 --> 00:28:58.350
So I went to a great designer and it’s the
company that’s Another Limited Rebellion

00:28:58.350 --> 00:29:04.359
and I said to Noah Scalin, who runs the company,
so I just want you to do something great.

00:29:04.359 --> 00:29:07.820
Take a look at the book and just think about
it and just let it rip.

00:29:07.820 --> 00:29:10.800
And he said, “well, a okay I have a few
questions for you.”

00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:15.450
And he sent me this extremely long questionnaire
with questions like, what do you want people

00:29:15.450 --> 00:29:17.480
to feel when they go on the website?

00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:18.480
All these things.

00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:22.360
And I thought, oh my God, and I called him,
and I said, “no, no, I am paying you to

00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:23.360
have the ideas [chuckles]

00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:24.360
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: [chuckles]

00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:26.109
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: I don't want to fill out
this questionnaire.” and he said, “Then,

00:29:26.109 --> 00:29:28.090
well, I’m sorry; we can't work together.”

00:29:28.090 --> 00:29:31.200
So I said, “Alright, I’ll fill out the
questionnaire.”

00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:35.499
So basically what he ended up saying to me
and what became kind of clear just from filling

00:29:35.499 --> 00:29:39.090
out the questionnaire was that I needed to
have the idea.

00:29:39.090 --> 00:29:43.279
Because the whole point was that the website
and the book would work together in some way,

00:29:43.279 --> 00:29:48.029
That it was not really his vision to have;
it had to be my vision.

00:29:48.029 --> 00:29:52.509
So I said, “I don't have any visions about
this; I don't think about websites.” and

00:29:52.509 --> 00:29:55.869
he said, “What do you normally do when you
are in this position with fiction?” and

00:29:55.869 --> 00:29:56.869
I said, “I go running.”

00:29:56.869 --> 00:29:58.220
and he said, “Go running.”

00:29:58.220 --> 00:30:00.049
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: So I went running.

00:30:00.049 --> 00:30:03.990
And I am not kidding, while running I had
a vision--

00:30:03.990 --> 00:30:05.630
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: [chuckles]
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: of how this could work.

00:30:05.630 --> 00:30:09.779
It didn't look the way it does because that’s
all him; it’s so beautifully designed.

00:30:09.779 --> 00:30:14.980
But I suddenly thought, what if I create a
kind of ghostly echo of the book which follows

00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:21.399
various people through various time periods
by using just a little bit of biographical

00:30:21.399 --> 00:30:29.239
context for each of those chapters which,
speak about different moments in certainly

00:30:29.239 --> 00:30:32.590
New City the life of New York City and also
some degree my life.

00:30:32.590 --> 00:30:37.059
I mean I witnessed that punk moment in San
Francisco in the late seventies, etcetera.

00:30:37.059 --> 00:30:41.309
It was a strange thing for me to do because
I don't like to write about myself and I don't.

00:30:41.309 --> 00:30:48.129
I’ve never blogged I don't tweet I’m pretty
reticent about revealing personal information

00:30:48.129 --> 00:30:52.860
not on principle but because I just don't
enjoy doing that kind of writing.

00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:57.239
But for this it seemed warranted; it felt
kind of necessary, artistically.

00:30:57.239 --> 00:31:03.769
So I went for it and he made it look really
good and so I’m so glad that it worked out.

00:31:03.769 --> 00:31:08.649
&gt;&gt;Interviewer : Did you always know that music
was gonna be a central part of the book?

00:31:08.649 --> 00:31:12.750
That, could Benny ever be a film producer
or a writer himself--

00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:14.299
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: I don't think so, no.

00:31:14.299 --> 00:31:15.299
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Or a music artist?

00:31:15.299 --> 00:31:17.700
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: I mean, when I started the
book, I didn't think I was writing a book.

00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:18.700
I should have said that.

00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:22.539
I thought I was taking a little breather from
a different book that I was trying to avoid

00:31:22.539 --> 00:31:25.230
writing by writing a few stories.

00:31:25.230 --> 00:31:26.950
Or at first, I thought it was just one story.

00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:32.889
I wrote about a women stealing a wallet on
a date and then she briefly mentioned her

00:31:32.889 --> 00:31:37.789
ex-boss, a record producer, who she mentions
to her date, sprinkles gold flakes in his

00:31:37.789 --> 00:31:40.470
coffee and sprays pesticide in his arm pits.

00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:43.859
I thought, “huh, gotta find out why he does
that stuff.”

00:31:43.859 --> 00:31:49.369
So I wrote the second, what became the second
chapter about Benny, the other major character.

00:31:49.369 --> 00:31:54.450
Just to write that chapter, which I wrote
second without even knowing that I was writing

00:31:54.450 --> 00:31:57.229
a book, I had to actually do a fair amount
of research.

00:31:57.229 --> 00:32:01.559
Because he’s at work as a music producer
and I didn't even really know the difference

00:32:01.559 --> 00:32:03.419
between analog and digital recording.

00:32:03.419 --> 00:32:08.749
So I had to spend a fair amount of time on
the phone with a mixer, talking about that

00:32:08.749 --> 00:32:09.749
technology.

00:32:09.749 --> 00:32:14.940
And in the course of that, what I think maybe
the reason that I really locked in with the

00:32:14.940 --> 00:32:19.090
industry, was that it was poignant to talk
to this guy who had worked in music industry

00:32:19.090 --> 00:32:24.470
for years and constantly have this sense with
him of a before and after in the industry.

00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:30.110
When the before being when it was strong and
the after being the current free fall which

00:32:30.110 --> 00:32:36.470
still has not really ended, of the industry
trying to find a workable business model in

00:32:36.470 --> 00:32:37.549
a digital age.

00:32:37.549 --> 00:32:42.029
So I guess that got me interested in what
it felt like from the inside.

00:32:42.029 --> 00:32:46.759
There were also a lot of other reasons that
I had wanted to write about the music industry

00:32:46.759 --> 00:32:48.489
for long time as a journalist.

00:32:48.489 --> 00:32:53.370
Never could really get an assignment which
was really annoying.

00:32:53.370 --> 00:32:55.679
But part of the reason that I couldn't get
an assignment was that I knew nothing about

00:32:55.679 --> 00:32:57.330
the industry and had no connections.

00:32:57.330 --> 00:33:00.500
The reason I wanted the assignment was so
that I could learn about the industry and

00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:02.210
get connections [chuckles]
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: [chuckles]

00:33:02.210 --> 00:33:07.369
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: but the New York Times Magazine
was looking for some kind of some opening

00:33:07.369 --> 00:33:09.990
move from me and I was looking for one from
them.

00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:11.879
So that never really happened.

00:33:11.879 --> 00:33:14.149
So there was kind of a long standing interest
in the industry.

00:33:14.149 --> 00:33:19.019
And I think also, as I said, Proust was so
important as an inspiration.

00:33:19.019 --> 00:33:25.379
And music plays a huge role in search of lost
time both as a plot element and also as an

00:33:25.379 --> 00:33:26.379
organizing principle.

00:33:26.379 --> 00:33:30.669
I mean, the novel is really constructed very
symphonically.

00:33:30.669 --> 00:33:35.150
So I guess in a way, that may have, obviously
it is a different type of music, but I think

00:33:35.150 --> 00:33:38.979
it may have suggested to me a kind of musical
model.

00:33:38.979 --> 00:33:43.950
And I think, as we all know from our own lives,
time and music are very deeply linked.

00:33:43.950 --> 00:33:50.690
I mean, music is a kind of time machine and
I’ve become only more aware of that as I

00:33:50.690 --> 00:33:57.559
put meaningful songs from my past on my iPod
and find myself immediately having memories

00:33:57.559 --> 00:34:00.419
linked to those songs every time I listen
to them.

00:34:00.419 --> 00:34:04.720
So, and actually one final reason, there’s
so many reasons.

00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:09.850
I think one reason I loved the idea of the
book as a concept album is that the atomized

00:34:09.850 --> 00:34:14.270
way that we buy music now has in some ways
endangered the concept album.

00:34:14.270 --> 00:34:16.619
The big musical vision that you--.

00:34:16.619 --> 00:34:22.389
OK, you have the two hits or one hit and that
makes everyone buy the album.

00:34:22.389 --> 00:34:24.869
But the great songs are never those hits.

00:34:24.869 --> 00:34:30.210
They're always the little in-between ones
that are odd and become beloved through lots

00:34:30.210 --> 00:34:31.679
of listening.

00:34:31.679 --> 00:34:37.379
But now we just buy the hits or the ones that
we heard on the radio or that SoundHound captured.

00:34:37.379 --> 00:34:43.679
And so I guess I felt nostalgic for that form,
for the big musical vision that with all of

00:34:43.679 --> 00:34:49.030
its component parts and the kind of majesty
of all of them colliding and having a listener

00:34:49.030 --> 00:34:51.500
engaged in all of that.

00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:54.429
&gt;&gt;Interviewer : What were you listening to
when you were writing, do you remember or

00:34:54.429 --> 00:34:56.039
were you consciously not listening?

00:34:56.039 --> 00:34:59.240
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: Oh no, I normally don't listen
to music when I work.

00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:02.060
When I wrote this book, I listened a lot.

00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:07.390
One reason was that it was hard for me; the
biggest technical challenge for me was to

00:35:07.390 --> 00:35:11.140
recalibrate so radically from one chapter
to the next.

00:35:11.140 --> 00:35:17.040
Because, since they don't feel like they're
one book, it was just a lot of changing of

00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:22.650
my own mindset and shedding of one voice to
try something totally different for the next

00:35:22.650 --> 00:35:23.650
chapter.

00:35:23.650 --> 00:35:25.500
And I found that music really helped me do
that.

00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:27.790
Sometimes it was just locating me in time.

00:35:27.790 --> 00:35:32.500
So not surprisingly, writing about the punk
rock scene in San Francisco in the late seventies,

00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:34.500
I was listening to music from the punk rock
scene--

00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:35.500
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: [chuckles]

00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:36.500
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: from the late seventies.

00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:40.470
Which in a way was so fascinating because
bands that never even recorded are still on

00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:41.470
YouTube.

00:35:41.470 --> 00:35:44.750
And it was really moving, actually, to watch
them.

00:35:44.750 --> 00:35:50.700
Many of them were dead by then, by the time
I was watching these videos.

00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:58.630
Anyways, so yes, I listened a lot and I think
it helped to sink me into the mood and the

00:35:58.630 --> 00:36:00.200
tone of each chapter.

00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:06.190
Sometimes, interestingly, the music that helped
me was not music that you would think would

00:36:06.190 --> 00:36:08.300
be connected to a particular chapter.

00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:13.130
So unlike the punk rock getting me into the
mood to write about punk rock, when I was

00:36:13.130 --> 00:36:16.980
writing the PowerPoint chapter which is called
Great Rock and Roll Pauses.

00:36:16.980 --> 00:36:22.280
And it’s about a kid with an Asperger’s
obsession with the pauses in rock and roll

00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:26.289
songs and he times them and measures them
and loops them so he’s just listening to

00:36:26.289 --> 00:36:27.450
the pauses continuously.

00:36:27.450 --> 00:36:32.349
And of course I listen to songs with pauses
as I worked on that chapter.

00:36:32.349 --> 00:36:37.559
But when I got very stuck, for some reason,
there was a song by the band Lets Go Sailing

00:36:37.559 --> 00:36:42.450
called Sideways and whenever I would listen
to that song, I felt like it captured the

00:36:42.450 --> 00:36:44.970
mood that I wanted in that chapter.

00:36:44.970 --> 00:36:50.690
There’s something young, very young and
kind of hopeful about the voice and so at

00:36:50.690 --> 00:36:55.770
one point when I really thought I might not
be able to finish the chapter I put Sideways

00:36:55.770 --> 00:37:00.220
on repeat and walked around Brooklyn and I
listened to it continuously for hours.

00:37:00.220 --> 00:37:01.220
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: [chuckles]

00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:04.960
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: I’m sorry to say I basically
can't listen to that song anymore [laughs]

00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:05.960
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: [laughs]

00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:10.220
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: I pretty much exhausted it
in that one shot but it helped me finish the

00:37:10.220 --> 00:37:11.220
chapter.

00:37:11.220 --> 00:37:12.470
I really feel that it did.

00:37:12.470 --> 00:37:13.789
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Interesting.

00:37:13.789 --> 00:37:21.050
So you’ve said that the you think of the
novel as a really elastic form that, in fact,

00:37:21.050 --> 00:37:27.000
can be conceived as really form-bending by
use of language and style.

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:32.920
Do you think that other sort of integers like
format or display or the ways in which people

00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:40.170
interact with novels can be as form-bending
as like pieces of a novel itself?

00:37:40.170 --> 00:37:43.390
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: I’m not sure I understand
your question

00:37:43.390 --> 00:37:49.310
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Like what if the, I’m thinking
about, if we use language and style to push

00:37:49.310 --> 00:37:52.540
the limits of what a novel is.

00:37:52.540 --> 00:37:57.490
Can we redefine what those sort of limits
are by the ways in which we consume them or

00:37:57.490 --> 00:37:59.400
find them or share them?

00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:08.369
Or do you think that there is that that malleability
of form extends to like what the reading is

00:38:08.369 --> 00:38:09.369
like.

00:38:09.369 --> 00:38:13.400
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: Theoretically, yes but I’m
not totally it’s so hypothetical—

00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:14.400
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Right

00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:16.730
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: that I’m not sure what
to envision there.

00:38:16.730 --> 00:38:23.470
But I guess the big thing I would say what
has always driven me to do work that I guess

00:38:23.470 --> 00:38:28.290
you could call experimental, although I never
think of it that way, is usually just that

00:38:28.290 --> 00:38:31.039
the people that I’m writing about and kind
of what needs to happen.

00:38:31.039 --> 00:38:33.830
That’s always what gets me there.

00:38:33.830 --> 00:38:38.740
For example, I was very interested in writing
in PowerPoint but I could only really get

00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:44.010
any kind of traction in the form when I found
a story that could actually only be told in

00:38:44.010 --> 00:38:45.120
PowerPoint.

00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:49.859
So and the reason that I say that, that might
sound odd, but the story that I tell in PowerPoint

00:38:49.859 --> 00:38:56.270
is a very sweet actually I would even say
sentimental simple story very little happens.

00:38:56.270 --> 00:39:00.080
It’s about a family that loves each and
struggles and I mean just saying that you

00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:05.369
think “ahh, cliché alert” but the thing
is that interestingly the coldness the very

00:39:05.369 --> 00:39:10.270
corporate feeling that makes PowerPoint so
difficult as a medium for fiction, I think

00:39:10.270 --> 00:39:16.150
actually worked in that case, for those who
agree that it works, because it off set the

00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:21.039
sweetness and somehow balanced it in some
way.

00:39:21.039 --> 00:39:27.420
So I’m willing to try anything and open
to reading anything that is going to give

00:39:27.420 --> 00:39:31.839
me a great story about people and what they
do.

00:39:31.839 --> 00:39:36.359
And if it’s done in a way that is interesting
and innovative, I feel like that’s all the

00:39:36.359 --> 00:39:37.430
more exciting.

00:39:37.430 --> 00:39:45.150
What I, personally, am wary of, certainly,
as a writer is the impulse to do wacky things

00:39:45.150 --> 00:39:51.170
with form and kind of impose them onto work
that is basically, probably, would best be

00:39:51.170 --> 00:39:52.390
told conventionally.

00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:57.440
It's a great effort but it often doesn't end
up really working.

00:39:57.440 --> 00:40:03.270
What I think, what I’m most interested in
about experimentation, so called experimentation,

00:40:03.270 --> 00:40:06.349
is that it lets me tell stories that I couldn't
tell otherwise.

00:40:06.349 --> 00:40:08.510
That’s what’s so fun about it.

00:40:08.510 --> 00:40:12.010
In the case of the PowerPoint, I, ironically
it’s a story I couldn't tell otherwise because

00:40:12.010 --> 00:40:16.869
it would be so clichéd and slow and simple
and way too familiar.

00:40:16.869 --> 00:40:22.240
But in a way, all of Goon Squad is this very
kind of laterally moving story about a lot

00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:25.610
of different people whose lives who overlap
and somewhat entangle.

00:40:25.610 --> 00:40:31.140
And I don't know how I could really deliver
that story in a more conventional novel form.

00:40:31.140 --> 00:40:38.880
I think that the centrally, the central nature
of the novel composition and the relative,

00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:45.500
compared to Goon Squad, uniformity of tone
and voice would have sunk my effort to try

00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:47.230
to do what I was trying to do here.

00:40:47.230 --> 00:40:52.980
So that’s really why I had to do what I
did it was just serving that particular story

00:40:52.980 --> 00:40:57.470
and I’m open to anything that is serving
a particular story.

00:40:57.470 --> 00:41:01.540
Whatever, however, the wackier the better
why not.

00:41:01.540 --> 00:41:05.210
[chuckles] I guess one other thing I would
say about that is there is a lot of fear out

00:41:05.210 --> 00:41:10.099
there right now about the future of the novel
and people are often saying why will people

00:41:10.099 --> 00:41:12.339
read if there are so many distractions.

00:41:12.339 --> 00:41:14.859
And I really share that anxiety.

00:41:14.859 --> 00:41:19.349
I feel it most as a parent because I have
two boys who absolutely would love to play

00:41:19.349 --> 00:41:24.529
video games from morning until night if I
let them and they would pick those over reading

00:41:24.529 --> 00:41:25.849
any day of the week.

00:41:25.849 --> 00:41:30.680
And that, I think, it’s not a good thing
and on a personal level it literally fills

00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:32.760
me with terror.

00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:39.869
So I feel those anxieties but I really do
sort of as a writer I feel like if we do our

00:41:39.869 --> 00:41:43.140
job, the novel should remain very strong.

00:41:43.140 --> 00:41:49.170
It should not be sapped and weakened by these
by whatever new technology comes along.

00:41:49.170 --> 00:41:50.270
It should be strengthened.

00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:57.170
It should suck all of it into itself and use
it and I feel like people are not gonna read

00:41:57.170 --> 00:42:01.369
because everyone tells them it’s like taking
vitamins and it will make you smarter.

00:42:01.369 --> 00:42:03.490
That is just a chore and a job.

00:42:03.490 --> 00:42:06.500
No one’s gonna read if that’s the reason.

00:42:06.500 --> 00:42:07.630
They’re gonna read--.

00:42:07.630 --> 00:42:12.610
It’s our job to write stuff that is irresistible
that you can't put down, that feels exciting

00:42:12.610 --> 00:42:13.610
and important.

00:42:13.610 --> 00:42:18.350
And I really, maybe this is just ridiculous
optimism, maybe this is just what I have to

00:42:18.350 --> 00:42:23.390
tell myself to get through the day, but I
do believe that if we do that the novel will

00:42:23.390 --> 00:42:25.059
thrive will continue to thrive.

00:42:25.059 --> 00:42:29.980
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: I have just one more question
for you before we take questions from the

00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:36.549
audience and it was, how you feel about writing
now after having won the Pulitzer, all these

00:42:36.549 --> 00:42:37.549
prizes.

00:42:37.549 --> 00:42:44.420
Like I would imagine that level of success
and attention would be overwhelming but also

00:42:44.420 --> 00:42:47.089
maybe liberating because you’re like, wow,
I won the Pulitzer.

00:42:47.089 --> 00:42:51.250
Like, just, I could just write whatever I
want now [chuckles] but maybe it’s not that

00:42:51.250 --> 00:42:52.250
easy.

00:42:52.250 --> 00:42:56.690
I don't mean to simplify it but like, it does
does it open you up to say what is after this.

00:42:56.690 --> 00:42:59.819
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: I look forward to really
knowing the answer to that question

00:42:59.819 --> 00:43:00.819
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: [laughs]

00:43:00.819 --> 00:43:07.420
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: I have found the sort of
strange novella story that I’ve written

00:43:07.420 --> 00:43:09.400
about the character from Goon Squad.

00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:12.819
I felt completely, I felt like it had no--.

00:43:12.819 --> 00:43:16.839
The Pulitzer or anything that happened with
Goon Squad seemed to have no impact on that.

00:43:16.839 --> 00:43:21.140
It’s just the project was it had a kind
of center of gravity of its own and it just

00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:22.520
kind of pulled me through it.

00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:26.890
I’m hoping that’s how it will be with
my next book too.

00:43:26.890 --> 00:43:32.470
The fear is that I’ll feel tremendous crushing
pressure and be convinced that this is no

00:43:32.470 --> 00:43:38.150
good and that everyone will hate it but, in
a way, I also feel like, in a way, I know

00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:43.049
that it's whatever I do next probably forever
won't get the kind of love that Goon Squad

00:43:43.049 --> 00:43:44.049
has gotten.

00:43:44.049 --> 00:43:46.190
So I accept that right on the outset.

00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:51.770
I’m grateful for what I’ve had and my
personal goal is just to keep getting better.

00:43:51.770 --> 00:43:57.089
I mean, I really wanna top Goon Squad and
try to do something that’s different and

00:43:57.089 --> 00:44:01.760
very strong, stronger, ideally in its own
way.

00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:03.930
That’s really the bar that I’ve set.

00:44:03.930 --> 00:44:08.660
So I’m not, I feel like I’m not that worried
about what the world says because I kind of

00:44:08.660 --> 00:44:14.339
already know what it will say and it’s it
inevitably will seem to be less good than

00:44:14.339 --> 00:44:17.451
a book that’s gotten all this love showered
on it.

00:44:17.451 --> 00:44:18.640
And that’s fine.

00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:23.550
But I do hope that I can do something that
I think is interesting and strong and I guess

00:44:23.550 --> 00:44:27.250
that’s really no different from the way
I’ve felt every time so I don't know that

00:44:27.250 --> 00:44:28.450
it’s really changed the feeling—

00:44:28.450 --> 00:44:29.450
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: uh huh

00:44:29.450 --> 00:44:30.450
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: deeply.

00:44:30.450 --> 00:44:34.779
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Do you look back at your earlier
books and think that you topped yourself with

00:44:34.779 --> 00:44:35.779
this book?

00:44:35.779 --> 00:44:41.309
I mean, I love The Keep and that was a totally
different book; haunting and wonderful.

00:44:41.309 --> 00:44:44.089
And I can't compare them because I think they're
so different.

00:44:44.089 --> 00:44:49.559
But I wonder if you think about them that
way, like, if one sort, of that you, just

00:44:49.559 --> 00:44:50.559
raising the bar each time.

00:44:50.559 --> 00:44:54.569
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: My personal favorite is Look
at Me so one before The Keep.

00:44:54.569 --> 00:44:58.990
So I guess, I feel as you do that they're
so different it’s a little bit hard to really

00:44:58.990 --> 00:45:00.619
compare them.

00:45:00.619 --> 00:45:05.450
I think that it may be that Goon Squad does
its job better than Look At Me but I guess,

00:45:05.450 --> 00:45:10.040
I still feel, that maybe Look at Me is more
ambitious in a certain way.

00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:15.609
So it certainly was full of a lot of very
big abstract questions.

00:45:15.609 --> 00:45:17.250
I feel like I just like got out there—
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: [chuckles]

00:45:17.250 --> 00:45:23.349
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: and I thought “how has
mass media image culture impacted inner life?”

00:45:23.349 --> 00:45:24.700
I mean, that’s a pretty big question.

00:45:24.700 --> 00:45:27.120
[chuckles] That’s what I was trying to answer.

00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:30.800
Or although, interestingly, I think the answer
was different than what I thought it would

00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:31.800
be.

00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:35.250
I think began the book feeling pessimistic
and emerged from it feeling optimistic.

00:45:35.250 --> 00:45:41.619
But yeah, so I guess I feel that each one
has managed to do something different from

00:45:41.619 --> 00:45:45.869
the others and I'm pleased about that and
that’s kind of all I know and I just wanna

00:45:45.869 --> 00:45:46.790
try and keep doing that.
