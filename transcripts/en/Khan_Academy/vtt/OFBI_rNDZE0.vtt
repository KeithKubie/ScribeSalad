00:00:00.433 --> 00:00:04.100
Voiceover:Let's say that
I have the unit vector U

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.300
and in the horizontal direction

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.633
for every 1/3rd it goes,
it goes square root

00:00:09.633 --> 00:00:12.933
of eight over three in
the vertical direction.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.567
And we can verify that this
is indeed a unit vector.

00:00:16.567 --> 00:00:20.433
The magnitude of our vector U

00:00:20.433 --> 00:00:23.233
is going to be equal to the square root of

00:00:23.233 --> 00:00:25.566
the sum of the squares of the components.

00:00:25.566 --> 00:00:26.900
And this, once again, just comes

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.666
straight out of the Pythagorean Theorem.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.233
So it's going to be equal to the

00:00:30.233 --> 00:00:33.133
square root of 1/3rd squared plus

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.200
square root of eight over three squared.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.066
And what's that going to be?

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.833
Well that's going to
be equal to the square

00:00:45.833 --> 00:00:51.733
root of one over nine
plus eight over nine.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.200
Which is equal to, and I
think you see this coming,

00:00:57.433 --> 00:01:01.366
square root of nine over
nine, which is equal to one.

00:01:01.366 --> 00:01:04.133
So this is indeed a unit vector.

00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:06.766
Let's say someone says,
"Well I like this direction,

00:01:06.766 --> 00:01:09.966
"but I don't want the
magnitude to just be one.

00:01:09.966 --> 00:01:14.733
"I want to find some vector V

00:01:15.433 --> 00:01:18.100
"that has the same
direction, so it has same

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:24.827
"direction as U, but has
a magnitude of eleven."

00:01:27.011 --> 00:01:31.966
So we want the vector V to
have a magnitude of eleven.

00:01:31.966 --> 00:01:33.800
So how could I define vector V?

00:01:34.433 --> 00:01:36.566
One way to think about
it is if we just scale

00:01:36.566 --> 00:01:40.133
each of the components of U up by eleven,

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.700
then we will have gone
in the same direction,

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.233
but now we will have a
magnitude eleven times as big.

00:01:47.233 --> 00:01:48.500
And if we start with the magnitude of one

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.133
we'll now have a magnitude of eleven.

00:01:50.366 --> 00:01:55.166
So we could say that vector
V could be eleven times

00:01:55.166 --> 00:02:01.933
one third, comma, square
root of eight over three.

00:02:02.433 --> 00:02:04.100
And so what is this going to be equal to?

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.133
This is going to be equal
to eleven over three,

00:02:10.566 --> 00:02:19.600
comma, eleven square roots
of eight, over three.

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.433
And I encourage you, if
you don't believe me,

00:02:22.433 --> 00:02:25.233
I guess on one level it should make sense

00:02:25.233 --> 00:02:27.166
that when you multiply a vector times

00:02:27.166 --> 00:02:32.966
a [scalerite] like this, it just
scales it in that direction by

00:02:32.966 --> 00:02:35.633
this factor, so if your magnitude was one,

00:02:35.633 --> 00:02:38.866
your magnitude will now be
eleven in that direction.

00:02:38.966 --> 00:02:42.100
But if you want, you could actually verify

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.100
mathematically that the magnitude here,

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.366
if you were to calculate
it, is going to be eleven

00:02:47.366 --> 00:02:51.866
instead of one, as in the
case of unit vector U.
