the conclusion is going to focus a
 

00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:01.170
the conclusion is going to focus a
little more on a lead issues of how the

00:30:01.170 --> 00:30:01.180
little more on a lead issues of how the

so first how do Americans think of
 

00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:10.670
so first how do Americans think of
Russia and and the answer here I think

00:30:10.670 --> 00:30:10.680
Russia and and the answer here I think
 

00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:11.810
Russia and and the answer here I think
as we all know is pretty straightforward

00:30:11.810 --> 00:30:11.820
as we all know is pretty straightforward
 

00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:15.470
as we all know is pretty straightforward
they don't write ordinary American folks

00:30:15.470 --> 00:30:15.480

Russia Georgia and I say no not exactly
right um so there's not a lot of

00:30:28.580 --> 00:30:28.590
right um so there's not a lot of
 

00:30:28.590 --> 00:30:32.480
right um so there's not a lot of
attention paid to it it's um it's it's

00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:32.490
attention paid to it it's um it's it's
 

00:30:32.490 --> 00:30:33.860

yeah I think that if we take a step back

00:30:58.070 --> 00:30:58.080
yeah I think that if we take a step back
 

00:30:58.080 --> 00:30:59.840
yeah I think that if we take a step back
we may think maybe Mexico is actually

is important to have a sense of
 

00:31:08.730 --> 00:31:12.260
is important to have a sense of
perspective on this I think it probably

00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:12.270
perspective on this I think it probably
 

00:31:12.270 --> 00:31:14.200

and of course this all occurs in an era

00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:32.730
and of course this all occurs in an era
 

00:31:32.730 --> 00:31:34.970

which is dominated by non-state actors

which is dominated by non-state actors

which is dominated by non-state actors
and non-state threats right and perhaps

00:31:37.370 --> 00:31:37.380
and non-state threats right and perhaps
 

00:31:37.380 --> 00:31:39.200
and non-state threats right and perhaps
one where because of that we've lost a

with bilateral relationships um now this

00:31:44.570 --> 00:31:44.580
with bilateral relationships um now this
 

00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:46.280
with bilateral relationships um now this
creates a problem for the us-russia

00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:46.290
creates a problem for the us-russia
 

00:31:46.290 --> 00:31:48.260
creates a problem for the us-russia
relationship right it's hard to really

00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:48.270
relationship right it's hard to really

of the day the elites don't think it's
 

00:31:51.990 --> 00:31:53.570
of the day the elites don't think it's
all that important and the ordinary

00:31:53.570 --> 00:31:53.580
all that important and the ordinary
 

00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:55.310
all that important and the ordinary
people don't don't don't think about it

00:31:55.310 --> 00:31:55.320
people don't don't don't think about it
 

00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:58.820
people don't don't don't think about it
at all especially when certainly for

at all especially when certainly for

some of things we've discussed today

it's not it's far from obvious that

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:02.010
it's not it's far from obvious that

it's not it's far from obvious that
that's the view in Russia there may be

that's the view in Russia there may be

that's the view in Russia there may be
some people the third group perhaps hold

00:32:05.870 --> 00:32:05.880
some people the third group perhaps hold
 

00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:07.010
some people the third group perhaps hold
that view of the United States but

00:32:07.010 --> 00:32:07.020
that view of the United States but
 

00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:08.630
that view of the United States but
general that there's something of an

00:32:08.630 --> 00:32:08.640
general that there's something of an
 

00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:10.670
general that there's something of an
asymmetry there I think that's that's

00:32:10.670 --> 00:32:10.680
asymmetry there I think that's that's
 

00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:12.740
asymmetry there I think that's that's
kind of obvious what also strikes me is

00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:12.750
kind of obvious what also strikes me is
 

00:32:12.750 --> 00:32:14.840
kind of obvious what also strikes me is
that when you go when you talk to people

00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:14.850
that when you go when you talk to people
 

00:32:14.850 --> 00:32:16.640
that when you go when you talk to people

from the rest of the region that
asymmetry plays itself out

00:32:18.830 --> 00:32:18.840
asymmetry plays itself out

where you constantly hear doesn't the
 

00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:33.920
where you constantly hear doesn't the
United States understand that the Russia

is the biggest threat to world peace and
 

00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:37.310
is the biggest threat to world peace and
the answer is no the United States

00:32:37.310 --> 00:32:37.320
the answer is no the United States
 

00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:39.200
the answer is no the United States
really doesn't understand that the

00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:39.210
really doesn't understand that the
 

00:32:39.210 --> 00:32:40.610
