1
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:09,040
Hey, I'm Ben Shapiro and welcome to a
very special edition of the Rubin report.

2
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:10,180
Once you replacing another,

3
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:15,340
joining me today on his new set after 34
glorious days off the grid is the host

4
00:00:15,341 --> 00:00:18,190
of the Rubin report. Dave Ruben,
welcome back and I'm sorry dude

5
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:22,760
or Shapiro. I feel like I'm
in the twilight zone right
now. Truly. I really do.

6
00:00:22,761 --> 00:00:26,840
I mean, first of all of your hosting my
show, we're on a new set here, new chairs,

7
00:00:26,841 --> 00:00:30,890
new carpet, new tables, new art, do
everything I have. No, I genuinely,

8
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:32,660
genuinely,
genuinely,

9
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:37,900
I have no idea what's going on in the
world since August 1st I know one thing

10
00:00:38,061 --> 00:00:43,010
that I found out two days ago because
my dad could not control himself in an

11
00:00:43,011 --> 00:00:45,260
idiotic phone call.
So I know one thing,

12
00:00:45,261 --> 00:00:48,020
I suspect it's a pretty big
thing that that has happened.

13
00:00:48,021 --> 00:00:48,840
I know you have a list of it.

14
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,580
I had a list of 20 things here,

15
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,790
20 things that you missed it during
the last month because as we all know,

16
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:58,490
one month of time in Trump world is
actually seven years of regular time. So,

17
00:00:58,700 --> 00:00:58,841
but,

18
00:00:58,841 --> 00:01:01,970
but let's talk first about like what it
was like to actually be off the grid for

19
00:01:01,971 --> 00:01:05,490
for 34 days. I do it like once a week,
but you did it for 34 straight days,

20
00:01:05,491 --> 00:01:07,450
which has got to be both wonderful.

21
00:01:07,451 --> 00:01:10,500
And also now you have to feel like you
just jumped directly into assessed pool

22
00:01:10,501 --> 00:01:13,670
of crap. Well I haven't jumped
in yet. I think we're about to,

23
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,930
I will assure you is this
cesspool of crap right there.

24
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:18,590
I mean, first of all,
I just, I feel great.

25
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:21,340
I genuinely mean that.
Like

26
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:24,430
guys, I think because I'm going
to go, I know I'm going to just,

27
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,100
I'm going with a little bit of
like a runway here and then you're,

28
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:29,410
we're going to, you know, take
us off into the ditch. But like,

29
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:33,040
just in terms of like how I feel
as a human being right now, I,

30
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:36,700
my mind feels clear. I
feel good. I feel positive.

31
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:41,350
I feel very grateful for the things that
I have this last month. I mean really,

32
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:46,540
I don't know that I heard the
word Trump more than three times.

33
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:50,530
Truly. Like you know how every
conversation now that anyone has anywhere,

34
00:01:50,531 --> 00:01:53,980
and I'm not even just talking about the
world we live in, but just everywhere.

35
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:56,740
People talk about Trump all the time
to talk about politics all the time.

36
00:01:56,741 --> 00:02:00,310
Everyone thinks world war three starting
tomorrow or the Russians are just like

37
00:02:00,311 --> 00:02:05,311
this endless like rang core monster of
insanity and I didn't have any of it for

38
00:02:06,791 --> 00:02:07,270
a month.

39
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:12,270
I'm telling you that every interaction
that I had with the human being since

40
00:02:12,401 --> 00:02:15,970
August 1st and today's
September 4th was good.

41
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:17,440
It was decent weather.

42
00:02:17,441 --> 00:02:22,441
I was talking to cashiers or waitresses
or the girl at the hardware store who

43
00:02:22,571 --> 00:02:25,360
I've told you about who every time
at this local hardware store I go to,

44
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:29,230
she always goes, oh Dave, I love you,
but I really love that Ben Shapiro.

45
00:02:29,231 --> 00:02:31,960
It turns out that the hardware store is
closing and I said to her the other day,

46
00:02:31,961 --> 00:02:34,390
I said, well, good luck in whatever
you're going to do. And she was like, ah,

47
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,340
don't worry about it.
I'm going to Grad school now.

48
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:40,540
And it was just like talking to different
people and I tried to do all that

49
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:44,200
anyway and not be online all the time
and not focus on the hate and all that

50
00:02:44,201 --> 00:02:49,120
monstrosity. But I just, I feel
freaking clear man. I really do.

51
00:02:49,121 --> 00:02:52,240
And I'm psyched that we, that we did
all these changes around here and Yep.

52
00:02:52,241 --> 00:02:53,074
Beautiful.

53
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:55,170
Thank you for coming in and doing this.

54
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,010
[inaudible] the guy who read the

55
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:03,070
game of Thrones books and then was waiting
for the rest of the world to catch up

56
00:03:03,071 --> 00:03:05,960
on the red wedding. Yeah, exactly.
You're going to get ready my friend.

57
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,410
God, this is, this is going to be there.

58
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,030
Oh, it's, it's, it's pretty wild.

59
00:03:09,031 --> 00:03:12,750
But first I want to ask you about
like how hard was it to actually,

60
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:14,970
you know,
shut yourself off to a,

61
00:03:14,971 --> 00:03:18,330
to actually put that phone in that safe
because even for me, ideal once a week,

62
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:21,120
but you know, the rest of the week I
find myself, the phone's in my pocket.

63
00:03:21,121 --> 00:03:23,790
I'm checking Twitter almost
as a reflex at this point.

64
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:25,380
How hard was it to actually
put it down for a month?

65
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,380
Well,
first off,

66
00:03:26,381 --> 00:03:30,460
I want to give a little credit to the
orthodox Jews out there because perhaps

67
00:03:30,461 --> 00:03:33,460
this Shabbat thing has, has, well I
guess it's not just the orthodox thing,

68
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:36,580
but has figured something out with
getting off technologies. Well done guy,

69
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:40,300
because I actually get a score one
for God, right? Because look, I do,

70
00:03:40,301 --> 00:03:42,160
I try to do the weekends off in general,

71
00:03:42,161 --> 00:03:45,010
but I struggle with it sometimes in a lot
of times if I'm on the road, you know,

72
00:03:45,011 --> 00:03:47,020
I've been on the road with Peterson
for the last couple of months.

73
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:50,770
So like if I'm on the road, it's like,
yeah, what else am I going to be doing?

74
00:03:50,771 --> 00:03:53,950
You know, I can visit some tourist
stuff and had some dinners or whatever,

75
00:03:53,951 --> 00:03:57,850
but I'm feeling around it. Um, you know,
I did this thing last month, last year,

76
00:03:57,851 --> 00:04:02,770
last August, and it was,
it was basically, you know,

77
00:04:02,771 --> 00:04:04,720
the first couple of days ago going
into your pocket all the time.

78
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,200
Like literally you feel your phone there
or you get those phantom vibrations,

79
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:11,230
all of that stuff and you
feel like you need it.

80
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:13,630
Or you know what I noticed was weird.
Like if you're just,

81
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:15,340
if I was just waiting for somebody,

82
00:04:15,341 --> 00:04:18,280
like when's the last time you just
like waited on a corner for somebody,

83
00:04:18,281 --> 00:04:20,430
you automatically look at your phone.
Yup.

84
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,200
You don't just stand
there even for 10 seconds.

85
00:04:23,201 --> 00:04:26,980
You don't just stand there and kind of
like look around or people watch you or

86
00:04:26,981 --> 00:04:29,260
just think or look at
the sky or any of that.

87
00:04:29,261 --> 00:04:32,410
You literally just go to your phone
that moment. So that sort of thing.

88
00:04:32,411 --> 00:04:36,130
I noticed that in the moments of
quiet where I was doing nothing.

89
00:04:36,131 --> 00:04:40,120
If I was in between things you plan.
Even if I was taking a shit,

90
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,621
I'm on my phone.

91
00:04:41,621 --> 00:04:46,621
Usually I am and I suspect you are
interior but everyone's doing it.

92
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:51,910
But guess what? I was pooping phone
free and then you have moments to think.

93
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,900
I mean I know this

94
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,410
sounds suiting bay pooping,
phone free and I'm sorry that we did this.

95
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:59,500
Yeah.
Well it just look,

96
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:04,530
even this like avoiding
the news in general is also
work because what I realized

97
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:07,150
is when you're off this
for a little while,

98
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:11,220
we are slammed with this nonsense
all the time and when I say nonsense,

99
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:14,620
I don't mean the important things that
I think you and I and a bunch of other

100
00:05:14,621 --> 00:05:17,860
people are trying to talk about and trying
to deal with the difficult questions

101
00:05:17,861 --> 00:05:19,660
of the day and I'm sure we're
going to get into some of that,

102
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:23,770
but just the endless 24 hour news cycle
of just dribble that keeps everybody

103
00:05:23,771 --> 00:05:28,420
angry at each other and and confused about
truth and distracted and clicking and

104
00:05:28,421 --> 00:05:29,254
all that.

105
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:34,530
Even avoiding CNN when you're not looking
at television and don't have a phone

106
00:05:34,571 --> 00:05:38,620
was hard. CNN is wherever a
muted television is, period.

107
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:42,940
It's everywhere. Airports, it's
at the gym, it's at the local.

108
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:45,940
You're going to go to a burger joint.
It's play in or a diner or whatever.

109
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:48,760
Everywhere I go,
I went to get my car tuned up.

110
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:52,650
It's playing in the lobby there and I had
to literally avoid watching, you know,

111
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:55,240
cause there everything's breaking news
and none of it's really breaking news.

112
00:05:55,241 --> 00:05:58,640
They're actually breaking news. But you
know, you, I had to actually avoid that.

113
00:05:58,641 --> 00:06:01,910
So I was at the gym and they have all
these TVs up there and I had to literally

114
00:06:01,911 --> 00:06:04,760
do cardio with my head down because
I didn't even want to avoid that.

115
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:07,430
So we're just like slammed
with all of this stuff.

116
00:06:07,431 --> 00:06:10,850
And I think when you step away from it
a little bit that I know you're very

117
00:06:10,851 --> 00:06:14,840
excited to get me back in,
but when you step away from a little bit,

118
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:16,520
it does give you a little perspective.

119
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,220
And I always also thinking about
things like, I mean as I said,

120
00:06:19,221 --> 00:06:20,960
every interaction I had was positive.

121
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:25,850
Like this idea that we live in this
country of like endlessly racist,

122
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:30,500
evil people. When you're out there
actually talking to real people,

123
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:34,640
you know, and again I do this, I tried
to do as much of this as I can normally,

124
00:06:34,641 --> 00:06:39,320
but with then we're also in this digital
thing. It's like, it's not like that.

125
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:43,260
People are good. People want
the same thing. It's like I,

126
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:47,540
I so fundamentally believe that. And I,
I've always believed that, but I really,

127
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:48,300
really believe it.
Yeah.

128
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,930
Now I used to think that the hope
for the country rested and you know,

129
00:06:50,931 --> 00:06:54,470
the 40% of the population
that was following this
stuff closely and the more I

130
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,401
viewed this stuff,

131
00:06:55,401 --> 00:06:58,490
now I'm starting to think that the future
of the country rest with the 60% who

132
00:06:58,491 --> 00:06:59,960
really do not follow this stuff closely.

133
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:02,140
Well that's the thing. It's
like, well what do you do then?

134
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:05,920
Because part of me literally like a week
ago and I knew I was about to come back,

135
00:07:05,921 --> 00:07:10,450
I was like, man, like why ever come
back, I'll go find something else to do.

136
00:07:10,451 --> 00:07:14,410
I wanted to be in the NBA. Like fine. He
goes, you know, and not that you, I mean,

137
00:07:14,411 --> 00:07:17,590
you know how much, like you really
know how much I love this. And like,

138
00:07:17,591 --> 00:07:21,340
I think what we're doing is so important
and I think I'm a better person now and

139
00:07:21,341 --> 00:07:22,174
all this stuff.
And,

140
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:26,410
and after being on tour with Peterson
for months where for months I,

141
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:30,340
I've been performing in front of thousands
of people every night and it's this

142
00:07:30,341 --> 00:07:34,270
great love fest of people who are getting
their lives together and disagree on

143
00:07:34,271 --> 00:07:36,070
what the marginal political issues are.

144
00:07:36,071 --> 00:07:40,420
But like all of that greatness and
it's like I could see because of,

145
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:42,250
because of all the evil that is out there.

146
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:44,770
And when I say you blamed me just like
the hate and all the people that want to

147
00:07:44,771 --> 00:07:49,510
keep you clicking and angry and distracted
and, and fighting with everybody,

148
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:54,370
I could see why a lot of good people
that we really need would just be like,

149
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:58,270
I'm out all together. I'm never going to
post again. I'm never going to read this.

150
00:07:58,271 --> 00:07:58,981
I'm going, you know, and,

151
00:07:58,981 --> 00:08:03,400
and that's a real problem because then
if we push out all the good people,

152
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:08,290
now you have the middle majority that's
endlessly just being slammed by one side.

153
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:12,010
Dare I say that's partly why I think this
whole intellectual, dark web thing has,

154
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,620
has taken root and has some meaning now.

155
00:08:14,621 --> 00:08:17,890
It's because I think for all of our
differences, which we've discussed,

156
00:08:17,891 --> 00:08:20,710
many of them including abortion in
death penalty and a whole bunch of other

157
00:08:20,711 --> 00:08:21,520
things,

158
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:25,530
it's like we're trying to basically
live in the same society together and,

159
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:27,880
and not hate each other for
whatever those differences are.

160
00:08:27,881 --> 00:08:30,190
And as I said to you last time you were,
you were sitting here,

161
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:33,370
it's like on something like abortion where
we disagree. It's like, you know what?

162
00:08:33,371 --> 00:08:35,440
Hopefully for the next
50 years we'll do this.

163
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:38,200
And then maybe when I'm
a little older than you,

164
00:08:38,201 --> 00:08:40,510
so I'm 92 and where are you
going to be in 50 years?

165
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:43,140
Uh,
I'll be 84

166
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:47,750
and you're 84 like maybe one of us will
have moved one of us one way or another

167
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,880
in order to eight. And I know
you're looking at me going, Reuben,

168
00:08:49,881 --> 00:08:51,290
you're not going to move me.
But you know,

169
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:53,540
who knows what happens
over the course of time.

170
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:54,800
But the only thing that will allow them,

171
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:57,890
and we're looking at like, I don't
know if I'd be alive in 50 faith. No,

172
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,720
that's why I would recommend a
digital detox. I'm telling you,

173
00:09:00,721 --> 00:09:03,870
I feel better by hartfields better.
My head feels better.

174
00:09:03,871 --> 00:09:06,130
I know this is a little corny,
but I,

175
00:09:06,131 --> 00:09:09,120
I genuinely do feel that way and it was
also just making me want to reinvest in

176
00:09:09,121 --> 00:09:09,721
everything I'm doing.

177
00:09:09,721 --> 00:09:12,510
That's why we have a new set now and
a new website and all this. It's like,

178
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,310
I really like,

179
00:09:14,311 --> 00:09:18,150
I believe in this thing and I want to
sort of take now these pieces that I just

180
00:09:18,151 --> 00:09:23,151
absorbed of the world over the last
month and now apply them to all the stuff

181
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,650
that we talk about all the time.

182
00:09:25,651 --> 00:09:29,610
Shapiro here. Okay, here we go.

183
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:32,250
Let's go to work my friend.
And this was the, uh,

184
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:36,750
you were promised at Jami of News Shalvey
so, all right, so I know of the story.

185
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,970
Yeah. What, what was the last thing
that you saw on the news? Okay.

186
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:44,690
So the last thing that I know of was
the day that I got off the shutdown

187
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:45,870
everything.

188
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:50,390
The last thing that I heard was that
the New York Times hired that writer,

189
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:54,570
the the female Asian writer at, apparently
she had tweeted a lot of anti white.

190
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:58,770
Okay. So I know nothing free for
all I know she doesn't have a job.

191
00:09:58,771 --> 00:10:02,130
Now she does have a job. She has a bigger
job than ever. She has a show on CNN,

192
00:10:02,131 --> 00:10:02,964
she has a job,

193
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:07,560
she hasn't got back to see it at other
times and there was blow back on anyone

194
00:10:07,561 --> 00:10:09,180
who suggested that she was racist,

195
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:12,270
that a lot of the left came out and
said that she couldn't be racist because

196
00:10:12,271 --> 00:10:16,630
racism is actually discrimination
plus power. Nonsense.

197
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:20,040
She still has a job. Yeah,
and that's totally okay.

198
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:23,160
Let's be very clear on this because I
am familiar with and clear minded right

199
00:10:23,161 --> 00:10:26,850
now racism is hating someone
because of their race.

200
00:10:26,851 --> 00:10:28,170
It has nothing to do with power.

201
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:32,280
You can be black and hate white people
and you're a racist and you can be white

202
00:10:32,281 --> 00:10:33,720
and hate Asian people in you're racist.

203
00:10:33,721 --> 00:10:38,160
And you can be Asian and hate
Latino people just because
of their skin color and

204
00:10:38,161 --> 00:10:39,870
you are racist. No, not
according to the New York Times.

205
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:44,040
The New York Times is wrong. That's
the end of that story. Meanwhile,

206
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:47,640
Alex Jones got banned from Facebook,
so she still has a job there.

207
00:10:47,641 --> 00:10:51,330
So I saw a bunch of the tweets, the
only one of the, the one tweet, look,

208
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:54,390
I've joked, you know, before
I sort of woke up politically,

209
00:10:54,391 --> 00:10:57,420
I used to joke about Republicans being
an old white man a lot and whatever.

210
00:10:57,421 --> 00:10:58,760
And it was just stupid jokes.
And I,

211
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:03,240
I don't regret them because it's
just part of what made me me sort of,

212
00:11:03,241 --> 00:11:05,270
I think they're stupid
and they were short,

213
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:07,770
shortsighted and maybe not
very informed at that time.

214
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,900
But what the one tweet that I did see,

215
00:11:09,901 --> 00:11:12,630
and I think this might've been quite
literally the last thing I saw before I

216
00:11:12,631 --> 00:11:15,570
shut down was there was,
um,

217
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:19,020
something about she like hated,

218
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:21,660
she loves making old white
people cry or something.

219
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:25,740
And I thought that that kind of strikes,
uh,

220
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:30,130
that kind of strikes me in a different
way. You know what I mean? You know,

221
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:32,830
so there was a big argument
that took place over Sara Zhong,

222
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:34,560
not just over her actual comments,

223
00:11:34,561 --> 00:11:37,000
but over whether she should be fired
based on Twitter mobbing. So there was a,

224
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:41,460
there's a big sort of discussion that
happened about social media mobbing and

225
00:11:41,461 --> 00:11:44,810
people piling on and whether people ought
to be fired and lose their jobs over

226
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:45,990
old stuff that they've tweeted.

227
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,270
And of course that followed in the
wake of the James Gunn and stuff.

228
00:11:48,271 --> 00:11:51,120
But you were still here for those gems
gotten from guardians of the galaxy.

229
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:54,070
You Remember Brian?
So that happened just as I was

230
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:54,903
getting along.

231
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:58,170
Exactly. So James Gunn getting
guardians of the galaxy director,

232
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,550
he lost his job because there were some
old tweets of his that were, that were,

233
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,100
you know, making jokes about
pedophilia and such. Right.

234
00:12:05,101 --> 00:12:07,200
So there's a lot of talk about Twitter
mobbing and then the terrorists young

235
00:12:07,201 --> 00:12:08,850
thing happened and that was a Twitter mob.

236
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,850
And so there was a lot of
talk about whether you're not,

237
00:12:11,851 --> 00:12:14,070
whether she should have been hired,
which is a separate conversation,

238
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:17,010
but whether people should lose their
jobs based on people digging up crap you

239
00:12:17,011 --> 00:12:18,930
did 10 years ago and now coming after you.

240
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:22,700
So let me get this straight. So, so she
still has a job despite all that stuff.

241
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:25,520
Roseanne Barr does not have a job.
Correct. Because of one tweet,

242
00:12:25,521 --> 00:12:28,460
which I actually do believe that Roseanne
didn't know that Valerie Jarret was

243
00:12:28,461 --> 00:12:32,300
black and Rosa. That's crazy person.
Roseanne is what she, yes. Right.

244
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,450
So describe described crazy
person. That's right. Right.

245
00:12:35,451 --> 00:12:37,790
Well it depends which person you're
talking to. The right people are there.

246
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:40,220
But so, but I just want to understand
all this. If you're trying,

247
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,260
cause when you stepped away,
it does seem a little odd.

248
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,930
So Rosanne sends this one tweet,

249
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:47,630
which she apologized for us that
she didn't know that she was black.

250
00:12:47,631 --> 00:12:49,910
There's no reason to think that
Roseanne has a history of racism.

251
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,640
She's always been fighting for
lefty causes forever actually.

252
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:56,750
So she gets fired from the number one
stay calm in the country. Then this girl,

253
00:12:56,751 --> 00:13:00,190
sorry, one more time. Okay.
Sherry. John, cause I'm out
of it a little bit. She, yeah,

254
00:13:00,191 --> 00:13:04,030
she maintains her job. She maintains
her job and gun. His gun got fired.

255
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:06,100
Yeah, gun got fired. There was
an attempt to bring him back,

256
00:13:06,101 --> 00:13:07,300
but that kind of failed.

257
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:11,680
It turns out there were pictures of
him at some like joke pedophilia themed

258
00:13:11,681 --> 00:13:15,640
party with the women who were over age,
but the rest of school children in such.

259
00:13:15,641 --> 00:13:18,450
So Disney was not going
to maintain his job. So

260
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,940
I don't even know what to do with
all that. But I think partly I guess,

261
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:25,420
and I guess this is from stepping away
for a little bit, it's just this sort of,

262
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:29,770
when we apply the standard answer that
that I think that's what's driving people

263
00:13:29,771 --> 00:13:30,400
crazy.

264
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,580
Probably mostly conservatives and people
on the right because it seems to always

265
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,850
weigh much more heavily on you.

266
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:40,110
Please, I will can't unlearn one of
the facets of this that he ministers.

267
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,940
So Candace Owens then tweeted out
everything Sara Zhang had tweeted,

268
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:46,570
but with reversing the races and Twitter
immediately suspended her before they

269
00:13:46,571 --> 00:13:51,010
realized what she was doing.
No. Should they move Candace?
Yeah, that was good. Okay.

270
00:13:51,011 --> 00:13:51,844
So meanwhile,

271
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:55,720
Alex Jones gets banned from Facebook and
iTunes and there's a coordinated hit on

272
00:13:55,721 --> 00:13:56,740
Alex Jones between,

273
00:13:56,741 --> 00:14:01,741
I believe it was Facebook and Youtube
and iTunes to demonetize him and deny him

274
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:04,690
platforms. Wow. All in the
same day. All on the same day.

275
00:14:04,691 --> 00:14:06,850
I think it was a with me within 48 hours.

276
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,790
So it's fun to break this stuff
to you and a, and wow, wait,

277
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:11,920
so justi monetizing him? Uh, no.

278
00:14:11,921 --> 00:14:15,370
I think youtube actually took
down his entire channel. Oh Wow.

279
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:19,060
Wait 10 Alex Jones is not on Youtube. Uh,
I believe so. I haven't checked recently,

280
00:14:19,061 --> 00:14:22,600
but yes, that was the story. Uh, and
they all did this on the same day,

281
00:14:22,601 --> 00:14:26,170
within 48 hours. So it was, it was,
it was obviously a coordinated hit,

282
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:30,500
obviously coordinated hit. Wow. And
so they, they took him down. Uh,

283
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,290
they gave various reasons why,

284
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,360
but they didn't give any
sort of objective reason why.

285
00:14:34,361 --> 00:14:37,240
So it wasn't like some of them said it
was because he had threatened violence in

286
00:14:37,241 --> 00:14:37,601
the past.

287
00:14:37,601 --> 00:14:39,910
Some of them said that it was because
he had said on palatable things in the

288
00:14:39,911 --> 00:14:41,260
past,
but there was no clear standard.

289
00:14:41,261 --> 00:14:43,600
And so there are a lot of folks
on the right saying, listen,

290
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:45,820
even if you don't like Alex Jones,
you know when people,

291
00:14:45,821 --> 00:14:50,000
I said those and I know Alex Jones Fan,
I mean threatened me personally. Yeah.

292
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:53,540
But you got to at least articulate a
clear standard for how you're going to

293
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:56,450
police the boundaries here.
Otherwise everybody ends up in the,

294
00:14:56,451 --> 00:14:59,720
in the throw them overboard category
because these boundaries are randomly

295
00:14:59,721 --> 00:15:02,580
expanding. So yeah, Alex Jones got
hit. He hasn't really paid, um,

296
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:06,200
any series monetary price cause he has
alternative distribution channels and

297
00:15:06,201 --> 00:15:07,430
he's,
and he's insulated himself

298
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:09,590
nice things.
You get a massive hit.

299
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,700
Oh yeah. No, I mean it's, it's, you
know, obviously took it seriously.

300
00:15:12,701 --> 00:15:16,090
Although his listenership I'm sure is
up because people are tuning in because

301
00:15:16,091 --> 00:15:16,430
square,
right.

302
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:17,930
Let you stand on this
now because you know,

303
00:15:17,931 --> 00:15:20,460
for the last two years I've
been saying relentless Lee,

304
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:22,940
the answer is not government intervention.

305
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,560
I just don't think that the government
policing Facebook and Youtube and Twitter

306
00:15:27,561 --> 00:15:29,120
and all those things that
that will help anything.

307
00:15:29,121 --> 00:15:30,770
I think it would muck
things up even worse.

308
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:34,060
It would give more power to just
middle management bureaucrats. And,

309
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:35,990
and since the government is
not very good at anything,

310
00:15:35,991 --> 00:15:37,220
I don't think it would be very good at.
Yeah.

311
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:40,030
So president Trump has, this is one
of the other stories, president Trump,

312
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:42,590
his sort of jumped into this and
suggested, right. I'm still president.

313
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:46,300
He's still president. Oh, okay.
Congratulations to you back in time.

314
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,480
You didn't miss it and miss
the big finale. Oh, does it?

315
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:52,250
I didn't Miss Number 20 there.
Yeah, exactly. Yeah. But uh, he,

316
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:53,690
he was suggesting regulations.

317
00:15:53,691 --> 00:15:55,880
Some other Republicans have
sort of put it out there.

318
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:58,100
I don't agree with regulation,

319
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:01,310
but I do think that we're going to have
to come up with either some market based

320
00:16:01,311 --> 00:16:03,640
solutions or we're going to have to,
you know,

321
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:07,790
recognize and force Facebook
and Twitter to be treated as um,

322
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:10,790
as not platforms, but as,
as the actual publishers,

323
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:13,040
which is the real controversy
over over Facebook.

324
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:16,190
Is it a platform or is it a publisher
to lake over at daily wire, which I run,

325
00:16:16,191 --> 00:16:19,030
if we print something that is
liable as we will be sued. Yeah.

326
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:20,480
Illegally live will be sued.

327
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:23,240
If Facebook puts up in article
by us that is libelous,

328
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:26,810
then Facebook doesn't get sued. It's
a platform. If they're not policing,

329
00:16:26,811 --> 00:16:29,960
what can we put up in what cannot? At
what point do you start saying, well,

330
00:16:29,961 --> 00:16:33,080
you're just like the daily wire or the
New York Times or CNN and you start

331
00:16:33,081 --> 00:16:36,830
getting policed that way. I think that
Facebook either needs to demonstrate,

332
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:37,610
you know,

333
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:40,190
what it's objective standards are or
start getting treated like any other

334
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:42,710
publisher in the space.
Because if they're going to police,

335
00:16:42,711 --> 00:16:43,640
then they're policemen.

336
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:46,090
Yeah. So you're right and
you're being consistent with,

337
00:16:46,091 --> 00:16:48,670
I think what your other
views are in this department,

338
00:16:48,671 --> 00:16:52,690
but there's this piece of me that it's
like, did we miss the boat in a weird way,

339
00:16:52,691 --> 00:16:54,070
now that I've stepped away for a bit,

340
00:16:54,071 --> 00:16:57,340
like with the amount of people that are
watching Rogan and watching you and me

341
00:16:57,341 --> 00:16:59,830
and the rest of the and Sam
and everybody else is like,

342
00:16:59,831 --> 00:17:02,170
why don't we have a network already?
You're going to be like,

343
00:17:02,171 --> 00:17:05,020
I know there's endless discussions about
it. We've had discussions about it.

344
00:17:05,021 --> 00:17:06,070
We've met with people I,

345
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:08,350
but it's almost like there's
something that almost is like,

346
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,700
there's some other weird thing here,

347
00:17:09,701 --> 00:17:14,701
like the amount of power that these
companies have now amassed over us is

348
00:17:14,741 --> 00:17:19,140
bizarre and it's like if, if the crew of
us can't figure out how to do it, who,

349
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:22,510
who can figure out how to do it.
I don't know what the answer to that is,

350
00:17:22,511 --> 00:17:25,180
but it does. I'm a little,
I mean this is where,

351
00:17:25,181 --> 00:17:28,520
of course I'm for the market dictating
it so it's like, yeah, it's on the last,

352
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:31,540
yeah, you're like, let's get cracking.
Because at the end of the day, look,

353
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:36,310
forget Jones, he's irrelevant I
think in the scheme of whatever,

354
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:38,650
but it's like at the end of
the day you get rid of him.

355
00:17:38,651 --> 00:17:40,210
Well now you've moved the bar,
it gets a little,

356
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:43,150
there's a lot of people that think that
you are an extremist all by the way.

357
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,970
So I do want to mention this real quick.
So one of the, there were a couple,

358
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:49,830
two or three little things that were
rattling in my head about current while I

359
00:17:49,831 --> 00:17:54,831
was away and one of them was a few
weeks before I went offline was the mark

360
00:17:55,351 --> 00:17:55,981
Duplass thing.

361
00:17:55,981 --> 00:18:00,000
Right you and for some reason it was
really sticking with me while I was gone

362
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:03,180
because for those that don't remember
Mark Duplass, basically mark Duplass,

363
00:18:03,181 --> 00:18:07,650
who's a friend of mine who's been on
the show who is a lefty in an extremely

364
00:18:07,651 --> 00:18:08,880
decent human being,
a nice guy.

365
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:11,370
I had breakfast with him like two
weeks before the tweet was sent out.

366
00:18:11,371 --> 00:18:13,710
He has a really nice guy.
He's trying to bridge

367
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:16,360
by the office. We spend an hour and a
half together. You seem like a nice guy.

368
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:17,140
Yeah.

369
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:19,840
See He's just a nice guy
trying to do some nice work.

370
00:18:19,841 --> 00:18:23,470
He mostly does those comedy stuff. So, uh,

371
00:18:23,471 --> 00:18:25,840
he tweeted out basically that Benji,
Piero isn't the devil.

372
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,140
That's basically what [inaudible]
intentions and it was a nice guy. Yeah,

373
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:32,610
that's it. And, and basically that
people should take a look at you, right?

374
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:33,963
Yeah.

375
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:36,280
If you're looking for somebody who's
honest on the other side of the aisle or

376
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:36,540
something.

377
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,810
Yeah. So this happened a little
bit before I went off the grid,

378
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:42,330
but he deleted it then
tweeted at now apology.

379
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:44,630
So the mob comes after him.

380
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:48,800
He then tweets this thing about how he
doesn't stand for homophobic or racist

381
00:18:48,801 --> 00:18:53,690
views, implying basically that your race
or races through all the usual nonsense.

382
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,790
And I don't want to make this about
mark cause I think he's a good guy and I

383
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:59,150
don't know what pressure came to bear
on him either from studios or the mob.

384
00:18:59,151 --> 00:19:00,830
And it scares people.
You don't want to lose your job.

385
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:02,440
Hit him when he deleted
the tweet and I said,

386
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:04,270
I totally understand why you do that.
I get it.

387
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:06,450
And then the next morning he
tweeted out that was [inaudible],

388
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,590
right.
Good Times.

389
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:14,810
That was really rattling in my
head because as I've stepped away,

390
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:17,420
it's like, I know, and this
goes to what I said earlier,

391
00:19:17,421 --> 00:19:21,470
we need these middle decent people who
are willing to figure some things out.

392
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:25,520
And it's like they basically took him
out. And when I say they, it's like,

393
00:19:25,521 --> 00:19:29,660
who knows what that is? Is it just
the mob? Is it, you know, studios,

394
00:19:29,661 --> 00:19:30,950
I don't know exactly what it is,

395
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:34,250
but like those are the types
of people that we need.

396
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:36,710
And this is why I would link
it back to the Alex Jones.

397
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,710
They're shredding the Overton window. The
Overton window will continue to shrink.

398
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,830
It's like, all right, we get wordy Jones
one day and no one wants to defend Joan.

399
00:19:42,831 --> 00:19:44,600
So fine. Okay, he's gone.

400
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,680
But they'll keep moving it and they'll
keep saying that Shapiro's this or

401
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,180
Ruben's that or whatever it is.
And eventually,

402
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,730
eventually we'll be on the
outside of that thing too.

403
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:55,880
And that's very much on my mind for sure.

404
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,450
Okay. So in other news, uh,

405
00:19:57,451 --> 00:20:00,900
Alexander Ocozzio Cortez continues
to sort of gain steam as this.

406
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:05,370
So she's gaining steam. She continues
to gain sort of public promise.

407
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:06,900
You made a bunch of gas while you're out.
Yeah.

408
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:09,230
She suggested the middle
class doesn't exist anymore.

409
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,400
She suggested that
everybody in the country,

410
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:13,890
even though the economic
statistics are good,

411
00:20:13,891 --> 00:20:17,760
that's only because nobody has
two jobs. Yeah. Okay. And uh,

412
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:22,110
and then there was a bit of a tiff because
I offered to host her on my show or

413
00:20:22,111 --> 00:20:22,990
debate her. Oh, right.

414
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:26,900
And I offered to drop 10,000 bucks for
the privilege and she suggested I was cat

415
00:20:26,901 --> 00:20:28,410
calling her.
So that was,

416
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:32,970
so that was her response was that I
was cat calling her and then in their

417
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:35,730
mainstream editorials in the New York
Times suggesting that it was sexist for me

418
00:20:35,731 --> 00:20:39,980
to offer. Are you kidding? No. No. Sounds
good. Times. Not, not a major story,

419
00:20:39,981 --> 00:20:42,180
but drove the new cycle for
probably a couple of days. Um,

420
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:45,580
so you, I know you well enough.
You offered to debate her.

421
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:47,980
Was he offered to debate who
are either one? Either one,

422
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:50,740
whichever one you want. I said, I'm
happy to have you on the Sunday special.

423
00:20:50,741 --> 00:20:53,140
Would you have been on for a discussion
I've had on a bunch of people.

424
00:20:53,141 --> 00:20:56,950
I disagree with Aidan. Sam
On that special. Yeah, I've
had on Eric on that special,

425
00:20:56,951 --> 00:20:59,710
I've had an a bunch of people with whom
I disagree on a variety of issues on

426
00:20:59,711 --> 00:21:02,080
that special. Yeah, I and a, and I said,

427
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:06,160
I'll give $10,000 to charity or to
your campaign or the super pack,

428
00:21:06,161 --> 00:21:10,180
whatever you want. Uh, and or we can do
debate, whichever format you choose a,

429
00:21:10,181 --> 00:21:11,950
and she tweeted back that she,

430
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:15,310
that there's no reason for her to respond
to this is the equivalent of of men

431
00:21:15,311 --> 00:21:16,990
cat calling women,
which is like,

432
00:21:16,991 --> 00:21:18,820
I don't know how they can't
go home and it's equivalent

433
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,990
of men treating women equally.
That's what it is, right?

434
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:24,520
You're not viewing her,
you're not going,

435
00:21:24,521 --> 00:21:27,910
I want to talk to this woman because
she's a woman so I can destroy her.

436
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:28,983
You're going,

437
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:32,290
this is somebody who I disagree with or
at least I want to explore their ideas a

438
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,150
little bit more. We'll do
it either way. You want

439
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:38,310
also cat calling and me. Yeah.
Weird, weird moves. So that,

440
00:21:38,311 --> 00:21:40,500
so that was kind of a minor story and I
don't want to hover on that one too much

441
00:21:40,501 --> 00:21:41,334
cause to somebody

442
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:45,070
it does go to the sort of a a
bigger thing that these people are,

443
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:49,230
are put out there with their ideas.
That all sound good. All of this.

444
00:21:49,231 --> 00:21:51,330
I mean this is another thing that
was rattling in my brain a lot,

445
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:55,740
but all of this leftists stuff
that I used to buy your for gays,

446
00:21:55,741 --> 00:21:59,220
your board this year for poor people,
it's all bullshit.

447
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:03,300
It's all epic,
endless horse shit.

448
00:22:03,301 --> 00:22:08,100
I mean that really is all
it is. You're not for gays,
you're, you know what I mean?

449
00:22:08,101 --> 00:22:12,120
It doesn't even make sense to say you're
for gays because gays think differently

450
00:22:12,121 --> 00:22:14,580
that it's incredible. You'll never
believe this. You get 10 gays in a room.

451
00:22:14,581 --> 00:22:17,010
They probably have 12 different opinions.
And to say that you're,

452
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:20,160
you're for black people or have
four black conservatives. I mean,

453
00:22:20,161 --> 00:22:22,680
I know you know this stuff, but
again, when you step away from it,

454
00:22:22,681 --> 00:22:26,130
it's like be in a weird way. And
I hate, I really hate to do this,

455
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:31,170
but in a weird way. Uh, Catherine verbal,
seeing who's the last guest I had on, uh,

456
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:36,000
last week, but we had taped it at the end
of June. Uh, July. She's an educator in,

457
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:36,853
in England.

458
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:40,470
She had taught in the inner cities for
a long time and basically realized that

459
00:22:40,471 --> 00:22:43,110
all these guilty liberals were just
kept throwing money at things that were

460
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:46,470
keeping minorities oppressed.
And she said something that really hit me,

461
00:22:46,471 --> 00:22:50,370
and this is the last thing that I did
before I left. She was basically saying,

462
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,530
these people are the racists,
they're the modern racist.

463
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:57,750
And they're always screaming that we're
all the races and I don't want to become

464
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:59,970
men, so I don't want to sit
here and be like, Oh, you know,

465
00:22:59,971 --> 00:23:03,090
these lefties are all the
racist by, by, by, but the, the,

466
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:08,270
the racist ideas of the day are not coming
from conservatives and Libertarians.

467
00:23:09,331 --> 00:23:12,150
They're really not. And they're certainly
not coming from classical liberals.

468
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:17,010
They are coming from the progressive's
that actually is just true.

469
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,140
It just is. Okay. Shapiro,

470
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:20,061
let's go.
Okay.

471
00:23:20,061 --> 00:23:24,170
So let's do a bunch of Mueller updates
because there was a bunch of news

472
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:27,170
motherland, but you've already
told me Trump is still president.

473
00:23:27,171 --> 00:23:29,960
So friends and storm the castle.
Yeah, right, right. Oh the, the, the,

474
00:23:29,961 --> 00:23:33,170
the latest generic congressional
ballot has Republican's down,

475
00:23:33,171 --> 00:23:36,710
I think it was the NBC ballot today
has now 18. So do you buy that?

476
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,720
I buy the Republicans are down.
I don't,

477
00:23:38,721 --> 00:23:41,330
I don't think I've done 18 but I think
the Republicans have some serious

478
00:23:41,331 --> 00:23:45,200
problems in the midterms. The,
the, the, I mean Democrats,

479
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:48,830
a lot of motivation to turn out and they
have since the election because they

480
00:23:48,831 --> 00:23:50,870
feel like if they had turned out,
they would want in the last election,

481
00:23:50,871 --> 00:23:55,310
which is true. So that's, that's been
building. So here's what happened.

482
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:57,530
I'm gonna lump these all together
cause there's a lot. Okay.

483
00:23:57,531 --> 00:24:02,000
So Peter Struck that fire and over
at the, over at the, uh, at the FBI.

484
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:03,860
So Peter Struck,
has everyone recalls,

485
00:24:03,861 --> 00:24:06,290
is the guy who was texting
with his paramour Elisa page.

486
00:24:06,291 --> 00:24:08,630
And leading the Russia investigation
and the Hillary investigation,

487
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:13,970
and he was fired for essentially
sullying the reputation of the FBI.

488
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,440
So he ended up being fired.

489
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:18,390
President Trump provoked security
clearances for people like John Brennan,

490
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:23,180
former CIA director. There
were rumors that was gonna
happen. Yeah, so he did that.

491
00:24:23,181 --> 00:24:25,520
He, he revoked his security clearance.
So what do you make of that?

492
00:24:25,521 --> 00:24:28,070
Because I kind of,
I'm not a,

493
00:24:28,071 --> 00:24:30,890
I'm not an intelligence analyst
at the highest level is here,

494
00:24:30,891 --> 00:24:34,860
but the idea that that Brennan and some
of these guys were taking classified

495
00:24:34,861 --> 00:24:38,390
information and clearly leaking it to,
to the media or the Times or whatever.

496
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:41,330
Like forget what the information was.
Forget the Trump is president.

497
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:45,710
If anyone was president and former
officials who still have clearance,

498
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,150
which is also a little unclear to me.

499
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:49,420
Why is a former official
would clear rights. I mean,

500
00:24:49,421 --> 00:24:52,310
I guess the basic ideas that inform our
official, if I go to you for advice,

501
00:24:52,311 --> 00:24:54,020
I need to be asked to be able
to ask you about that stuff.

502
00:24:54,021 --> 00:24:56,210
And it's still a crime if you leak
classified information to the press,

503
00:24:56,211 --> 00:24:59,820
even if you no longer worked for the
government that said [inaudible] yeah,

504
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:01,730
there, there shouldn't be. In my opinion,

505
00:25:01,731 --> 00:25:04,340
there shouldn't be like a blanket security
clearance you get to maintain after

506
00:25:04,341 --> 00:25:06,020
you leave office.
It seems silly to me.

507
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,940
So who else was there
anyone else reporting?

508
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,310
I'm sure Brendan was probably the biggest.
Brennan was the biggest one.

509
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:14,390
He threatened to do it to Komi who I
think no longer has clearance and a bunch

510
00:25:14,391 --> 00:25:14,601
of other,

511
00:25:14,601 --> 00:25:17,720
basically what it looked like was it
coordinated political hit by Trump because

512
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,770
Trump then went on Twitter and said like,

513
00:25:18,771 --> 00:25:21,230
everybody I hate should no
longer have a security clearance,

514
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,360
and two people said
this is misuse of power,

515
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:26,540
which of course president Trump doing
everything in the dumbest possible way.

516
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:30,380
It sort of is, but that's Ed. Should
these people have security clearances?

517
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:33,410
Probably not. That was the minor
news in this, in this area.

518
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:35,740
That's huge in a certain
respect but crazy.

519
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,510
Here's the major news in the
major news is that Michael Kahn,

520
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:40,040
the President's forum personal attorney,

521
00:25:40,041 --> 00:25:44,630
pled guilty to eight different crimes
including violation of campaign finance

522
00:25:44,631 --> 00:25:49,100
law. And in that plea of
guilty for violation of
campaign finance all at the red

523
00:25:49,101 --> 00:25:49,934
wedding part,

524
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:53,870
he suggested that the president of the
United States ordered him to violate

525
00:25:53,871 --> 00:25:58,040
campaign finance law.
So ordered him before he was president.

526
00:25:58,041 --> 00:26:00,200
So just so the,
so here's what happened.

527
00:26:00,201 --> 00:26:04,640
He goes to pay off the stormy Daniels
via basically David Pecker over the

528
00:26:04,641 --> 00:26:05,480
national enquirer.

529
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:08,800
The idea was that this was a campaign
finance contribution that he,

530
00:26:08,801 --> 00:26:13,550
he had bought the story of stormy Daniels
from the national enquirer in order to

531
00:26:13,551 --> 00:26:14,384
silence it,

532
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:18,170
Pecker gone bought storming Daniel's
story and then team Trump buys the story

533
00:26:18,171 --> 00:26:22,340
from David Pecker Reimburses Pecker for
the story. Keep it quiet. Money was that.

534
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,040
So it was Michael Cohen's money.
So it looks like a,

535
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:27,860
it looks like a campaign contribution.

536
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:31,460
And then Trump backfills the amount of
money that Cohen paid over the course of

537
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:33,230
coming months.
Now,

538
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:38,260
the question is whether Trump knew that
he was violating campaign finance law

539
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:42,140
when he did that. Right. So in other
words, there are two ways he could have,

540
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:42,921
just legally speaking,

541
00:26:42,921 --> 00:26:44,880
there are two ways that he could
have avoided this being a campaign.

542
00:26:44,881 --> 00:26:49,010
Finance violations could flat out written
the check directly and then he would

543
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:51,600
have had to report it as a
campaign expenditure. Presumably.

544
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,740
Can you write it? Why campaign
expenditure? Why couldn't
you have just read it?

545
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,770
Let me check. So he can know, he
can read, he can write a check,

546
00:26:56,771 --> 00:26:58,920
but he has to report that to the FEC.
Right.

547
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:03,190
Or he can have Michael Cohen
write a track. Um, well he,

548
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:04,600
he would have to have,

549
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:08,860
he would have to do it personally or
he'd have to show that he basically used

550
00:27:08,861 --> 00:27:11,290
Colin is a pass through and
then reporting to the FCC.

551
00:27:11,291 --> 00:27:12,980
But there was no report to the FEC.
Right.

552
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,510
So basically the idea was that they found
a back channel to pay her off just so

553
00:27:16,511 --> 00:27:18,370
it wouldn't be reported a
week before the election.

554
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:23,080
And so the idea is that he was essentially
avoiding the reporting of the stormy

555
00:27:23,081 --> 00:27:26,020
Daniels single week before the
election by paying off a porn star.

556
00:27:26,021 --> 00:27:26,950
That's an in Michael.

557
00:27:26,951 --> 00:27:30,140
Colin was saying that Trump knew all of
this and Trump ordered all of this. Yeah,

558
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,970
and that's why he did all of this.
So how

559
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:34,500
are we supposed to get
any truth out of this?

560
00:27:34,501 --> 00:27:37,560
This is the type of thing where it's
like, again, stepping away, it's like,

561
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:40,050
all right,
we can do all the little legal loopholes,

562
00:27:40,051 --> 00:27:43,830
the little minutia and look back on two
years ago and who did this and that,

563
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:45,690
but it's like Michael,

564
00:27:45,691 --> 00:27:48,330
Colin probably wants to save his butt
now from certain amount of jail time,

565
00:27:48,331 --> 00:27:50,970
right? He's going to do whatever he can,
obviously to throw Trump under the bus.

566
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,810
I have no doubt that Trump probably did
some things out more out of just like

567
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:57,390
provato and stupidity.
Then like intention,

568
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:00,870
like do you think he really was like the
crime that they're going to get Trump

569
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:03,960
on? Was that a $250,000 pay
out to a porn star? Like,

570
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:05,310
how stupid is this whole thing?

571
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:05,830
Right?

572
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:09,820
So there are two ways in which Trump
could defend himself when he could say,

573
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:13,100
listen, I path ladies all the time. So
this isn't a campaign expenditure at all.

574
00:28:13,101 --> 00:28:14,740
Yeah. This is just me paying
off ladies who we know.

575
00:28:14,741 --> 00:28:17,440
Is there any history of Michael Cohen
doing this for him before? So there's a,

576
00:28:17,441 --> 00:28:19,960
there's a history of Michael and
kind of threatening people before,

577
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:23,440
but we haven't seen evidence that he's
like paid off a bunch of ladies before.

578
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,470
Yeah.
And the other thing that,

579
00:28:24,471 --> 00:28:27,640
that Trump theoretically could do to
avoid all of this is you could say, well,

580
00:28:27,641 --> 00:28:30,260
Michael cones the lawyer, I didn't tell
him to violate campaign finance law.

581
00:28:30,261 --> 00:28:33,070
It's his job to make sure that I'm in
compliance with campaign finance law.

582
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:36,220
I'm an idiot. Yeah. So what do I know
about campaign finance law? I just said,

583
00:28:36,221 --> 00:28:39,640
Michael, go, go settle this
thing up. I mean, that's the
Hillary email excuse. Right,

584
00:28:39,641 --> 00:28:43,830
right, right, right, right.
I'm an idiot. And it's not
implausible. Right? Yeah. That's,

585
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,550
that's a plausible defense that said,

586
00:28:45,551 --> 00:28:48,560
he is personal lawyer is testifying
in open court that Trump told them to

587
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:51,490
violate campaign finance law.
Does that mean Trump gets prosecuted?

588
00:28:51,491 --> 00:28:54,220
Nobody's again prosecute the former
president and you can't prosecute the

589
00:28:54,221 --> 00:28:57,040
current president of the United States
just legally speaking in all likelihood.

590
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:59,980
But will that be ground
zero for impeachment charge?

591
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:03,340
I'm sure that it will be the same day
that happened by the way, because yes,

592
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:06,160
we're all immediately show the same
day that happened. Paul Manafort,

593
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:08,680
his former campaign manager also
pled guilty to eight felonies.

594
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:11,480
None of them having to
do with campaign Trump,

595
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:15,070
but having to do with former campaign
finance violations in representing the

596
00:29:15,071 --> 00:29:16,900
Ukrainian government and
all of this kind of stuff.

597
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:19,450
And then Trump starts tweeting about how
Manafort's a good guy because he kept

598
00:29:19,451 --> 00:29:23,680
his mouth shut, which is because
president Trump has diarrhea of the,

599
00:29:23,681 --> 00:29:24,410
of the Twitter.

600
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:25,221
Well first off,
it's a wait.

601
00:29:25,221 --> 00:29:29,060
So Cohen's going in there and saying
Trump told him to violate campfire can be

602
00:29:29,061 --> 00:29:32,660
mindless. I mean that sounds actually
insane. So if that's actually true,

603
00:29:32,661 --> 00:29:36,380
like if Trump actually sat him
down, I was like, here's the check,

604
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:41,680
let's violate some campaign finance. Like
now we're veering into like, like true.

605
00:29:41,681 --> 00:29:42,030
Is that

606
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,770
possible? It's, it's, that sounds
to me, it depends on the bananas,

607
00:29:44,771 --> 00:29:48,100
but it depends how much plausible
deniability you need. Right? Right.

608
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:52,150
If Trump said, here's a check
for $130,000, go settle this up.

609
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:54,940
And Colin said to him, what we need
to report that to the FTC and said,

610
00:29:54,941 --> 00:29:57,760
well let's do cash. Right? And then,
then, then you've got a problem. But yeah,

611
00:29:57,910 --> 00:30:01,150
we have to see what that looks like and
it hasn't been taken that level yet.

612
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:04,900
The SDNY is still checking into that.
And what are you,

613
00:30:04,901 --> 00:30:08,680
so guy that's doing your show every,
yeah, talking about this stuff every day.

614
00:30:08,681 --> 00:30:10,750
I know you researched the early,
all of that.

615
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:15,880
How you find the ability to
talk about the ins and outs.

616
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:17,890
Honestly,
without,

617
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:22,090
without giving enough room where people
are just going to guess on all of these

618
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:27,160
[inaudible] some of that nuance that's
not going to be put on CNN and on CNN.

619
00:30:27,161 --> 00:30:30,310
It's he violated campaign finance law.
This is a, this is a federal violation.

620
00:30:30,311 --> 00:30:32,020
He should go to jail.
And the answer is,

621
00:30:32,021 --> 00:30:34,990
well that depends on the credibility
of cone. It depends on Trump's defense.

622
00:30:34,991 --> 00:30:36,160
It depends on a lot of stuff.

623
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:39,280
Trump doesn't help himself because he
goes on Twitter and just says shit. Right.

624
00:30:39,281 --> 00:30:42,610
I mean that's his thing. But I have
not seen a Trump tweet in a month.

625
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:46,180
Good for your dirty. For us. That's,
that's a, that's a daily relief. I'm sure.

626
00:30:46,181 --> 00:30:47,590
34 fucking damn.

627
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:52,330
Well in get ready man.
Cause there's some more comments up there.

628
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:55,930
So that was the big story because now
that I'm like how old is that story or

629
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:58,660
that this two weeks old. So it's like,
is it already running out of steam?

630
00:30:58,661 --> 00:31:00,490
I mean everything kind of like them.
Although you know,

631
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:03,280
maybe it's contributing to the
congressional ballot for example,

632
00:31:03,281 --> 00:31:07,030
because it feels like there's a level of
corruption that is being exacerbated by

633
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:09,490
another political story,
which is to Republican Congress.

634
00:31:09,491 --> 00:31:13,390
People are being prosecuted for corruption
right now. Duncan hunter down in,

635
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:15,130
so cal in San Diego,

636
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:19,360
he's being also prosecuted for looking
like he basically took a bunch of

637
00:31:19,361 --> 00:31:20,230
campaign finance,

638
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,740
the campaign funds and use
them on personal expenditures
and Chris Collins over

639
00:31:23,741 --> 00:31:27,220
in New York who these were the first
two congressional candidate who backed

640
00:31:27,221 --> 00:31:29,820
Trump and Collins came forth and uh,

641
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:33,160
and supposedly was engaged in
some sort of insider trading deal.

642
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:37,450
So both of them are now going to
be prosecuted by the sessions DOJ,

643
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,980
which is like president Trump's attack.

644
00:31:38,981 --> 00:31:42,580
Jeff sessions at the DOJ
and literally this morning,

645
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:47,230
tweet out that or last night tweet
out that that Jeff sessions is killing

646
00:31:47,231 --> 00:31:51,550
Republican congressional chances by
indicting Republican Congress paypal.

647
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,940
So that's all, what's the president?
He has his right to free speech.

648
00:31:54,941 --> 00:31:57,870
He's going to end up probably
screwing himself over with

649
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:01,690
all of that. Like when I'm
hearing this, it's like, man,

650
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:06,190
this is all just a great reason to
ultimately be libertarian. Like not,

651
00:32:06,191 --> 00:32:10,420
it seems like none of this works,
right? None of this actually works.

652
00:32:10,421 --> 00:32:12,040
Like if it all worked,

653
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:16,540
if there was a slim trim operating
government that didn't have too much power

654
00:32:16,541 --> 00:32:20,680
and could just move things on the margin
and not try to redistribute and all of

655
00:32:20,681 --> 00:32:21,640
these things,
it's like,

656
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,300
and it worked and it wasn't always the
old government does is investigate itself.

657
00:32:25,301 --> 00:32:28,720
All it does is throw money at things.
Like it doesn't do anything.

658
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:31,570
So all of these things, as you're
telling me, I know these are important,

659
00:32:31,571 --> 00:32:35,290
relevant things and when I fully dive
back in like six months, they may not be,

660
00:32:35,291 --> 00:32:36,670
and then two weeks,
they may not be because,

661
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:40,010
but at least understanding the issues
behind them are important. Like this, this

662
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:42,650
general thing of like, Oh,
this guy campaign finance,

663
00:32:42,651 --> 00:32:45,650
this guy that this is all they do,
this is all they do.

664
00:32:45,651 --> 00:32:48,740
And if you think Democrats are somehow
better than Republicans, you're wrong.

665
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:50,790
They're all doing it together.
Oh,

666
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:54,100
oh, I'm sorry. I'm sort of grouping these
into political and then we'll do some.

667
00:32:54,101 --> 00:32:56,710
And then there was a bunch of
cultural stuff that's already
happened. So, yeah, uh,

668
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:59,990
other political stuff. The cabinet hearing
is happening literally as we speak.

669
00:32:59,991 --> 00:33:03,820
Co Right now for the Democrats tried to
shut down the hearing from the beginning

670
00:33:03,821 --> 00:33:07,240
by calling for an adjournment
until they can read the document.

671
00:33:07,241 --> 00:33:09,070
Even the though they've already come
out and said they're not voting for

672
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:09,640
Cavenaugh.

673
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:13,390
Linda Sarsour got arrested because she
showed up and started yelling at a,

674
00:33:13,391 --> 00:33:15,550
at Cavenaugh and at the Republicans.

675
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:18,730
And so it kind of devolved into the
spectacle. We all knew that that would be,

676
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:22,520
you know, in, in the spirit
of my 34 days off the grid.

677
00:33:22,521 --> 00:33:26,230
I'm not gonna say a word about Linda.
So good for you dude. That is, Ooh,

678
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:30,370
that is some inner peace.
Or where do we pause though?

679
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:32,400
So there's nothing they can do to
stop cabinet. No, you're right.

680
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,970
So that's going to happen. You
know, you can, for the record,

681
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:38,990
people can find this video somewhere.
But when I was on TYT way back when and,

682
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:43,820
and Harry Reid use the nuclear option, and
I was still progressive, lefty liberal,

683
00:33:43,821 --> 00:33:48,350
blah, blah, blah, uh, I said, this
is a bad move. This is a bad move.

684
00:33:48,351 --> 00:33:52,060
You do not want to give this kind of
power cause it'll be used against ESL

685
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:55,850
in a bad move. It was. So there, there are
two anti Trump books that have come out.

686
00:33:56,090 --> 00:33:59,550
The first was from Omarosa Manigault
the media went nuts over this. She,

687
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,840
she had recordings.
She,

688
00:34:00,841 --> 00:34:04,190
she'd taken her cell phone into like
throughout the west wing and recorded a

689
00:34:04,191 --> 00:34:08,990
bunch of conversations with pretty much
everyone. Is that illegal? Um, maybe,

690
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:12,140
yeah, maybe there was nothing
classified on the recordings. Okay.

691
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:15,020
It's basically she had nothing to
sell and she sold whatever she had,

692
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:19,270
but it was nonstop on Cable News for
24 hours a day for a week. Uh, and uh,

693
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:21,950
maybe two weeks we're shooting to get
him saying, and then he, and then he,

694
00:34:21,951 --> 00:34:24,690
and then he tweeted out
that that Amarosa was fired.

695
00:34:24,691 --> 00:34:27,080
Nica Doug and what is something like that?

696
00:34:27,081 --> 00:34:30,210
And once he called her daughter
better than it's improving grammar.

697
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,660
But when once called their
dog then it turned into,

698
00:34:32,661 --> 00:34:36,020
is Trump a racist because he called her
a dog even though he was called half of

699
00:34:36,021 --> 00:34:39,290
humanity members of the canine species.
So yeah.

700
00:34:39,430 --> 00:34:41,290
So we enjoy two weeks of hours.

701
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:45,680
Amount of dog is actually an upgrade
over what I think about as humans at the

702
00:34:45,681 --> 00:34:46,670
moment. Yeah, that's exactly right.

703
00:34:46,671 --> 00:34:50,330
And then Bob Woodward's book comes out
this week and there were a bunch of sort

704
00:34:50,331 --> 00:34:53,660
of typical trumpy and stories,
John Kelly saying this place is miserable,

705
00:34:53,661 --> 00:34:58,661
the work and James Madis saying Trump
is basically a nut who wanted to uh,

706
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:03,110
pull completely out of South Korea and
asked for preemptive military options

707
00:35:03,111 --> 00:35:07,370
against North Korea and
various, and, and uh,

708
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:10,130
I think it was Gary Cohn,
like sneaking documents off of from Steph.

709
00:35:10,131 --> 00:35:10,881
So he wouldn't sign them.

710
00:35:10,881 --> 00:35:14,810
And Trump now notice to all the things
that you would expect in the Trump White

711
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:16,640
House. And so all that's
coming out and Woodward's book,

712
00:35:16,641 --> 00:35:18,590
so expect Trump to tweet
about that a lot this week.

713
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:23,300
And then we get to some of the cultural
issues. So at the Vma is bunch of stars.

714
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:25,430
Bash Trump. No shock there.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

715
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:29,420
You're telling me Hollywood people at an
awards show, we're anti Trump. I know.

716
00:35:29,421 --> 00:35:32,360
Shocker. That was a big one.
Then this changes every pet.

717
00:35:32,361 --> 00:35:35,840
Now I Asia Argento is
a leader in the me too.

718
00:35:35,841 --> 00:35:39,150
Movement was implicated in a,
in her own me to scandal.

719
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:43,050
So there's a 17 year old boy who had
one plate son in a movie, I guess,

720
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:47,190
and when he was 17 and
she was 36, 38, I believe,

721
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:49,600
they went to a hotel
rooms. She stepped him, uh,

722
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:54,330
and a a parent and which is statutory rape
in the state of California. And He, uh,

723
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:58,860
and he said that basically
been intimidated into it
and she was hit with this me

724
00:35:58,861 --> 00:36:01,590
too. Stuff also. And then Rose
McGowan came out and said,

725
00:36:01,591 --> 00:36:02,940
we should wait until
all the evidence is in,

726
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:06,360
which provided all sorts of fodder
for people who say, you know,

727
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:09,400
maybe we ought to wait for
all the evidence to come in.
So it's interesting. Yeah.

728
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:13,120
Now that it's turning on on its own
people and now we should wait. Right?

729
00:36:13,121 --> 00:36:16,360
Like Trudeau was like, we have to
believe all women. Then it came for him.

730
00:36:16,361 --> 00:36:19,480
Now we have to wait. It comes from one of
them. We two people, now we have to wait.

731
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:24,000
So this is bizarre. So that happens.
And, and uh, sorry, sewer this,

732
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,870
she was part of me too.
So this is, this is it.

733
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:26,310
Yeah.

734
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:29,600
There's also a story with mentioning in
New York University professor who was

735
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:32,030
like a performance
artist who is a lesbian,

736
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:34,760
but she was accused of sexually
harassing a gay man. Uh,

737
00:36:34,970 --> 00:36:36,530
and it's relatively credible.

738
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:38,720
A lesbian was sexually harassing a game.

739
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,260
She's not a very good lesbian. I think
that cheese there, there've been several.

740
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:45,620
Yeah, exactly. She'd bet it bad at the
lesbianisms. So yeah, it's so that, that,

741
00:36:45,621 --> 00:36:47,630
and the entire academy came
out to defender of course,

742
00:36:47,631 --> 00:36:50,500
because she's on the left and that's
the way this works. Um, let's see.

743
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:52,880
How was the lesbian sexually
harassing a game? I mean,

744
00:36:52,881 --> 00:36:56,210
she was sending him sexual
messages. I mean, they have
the text messages. So again,

745
00:36:56,730 --> 00:36:59,810
not good at the lesbian. I think how
stupid this whole thing is. I mean, look,

746
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:02,430
of course you got to
get the bad guys though.

747
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:06,690
The Harvey Weinsteins of course the people
that genuinely do the bad things that

748
00:37:06,691 --> 00:37:07,620
you have to get them.

749
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:11,460
But the thing that we're creating here
where people are going to be afraid of

750
00:37:11,461 --> 00:37:15,630
their own shadows. And you know, we're in
la here. I have a friend who's been in,

751
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:19,380
in uh, the battle, want to give away
too much, who's been in the Biz on the,

752
00:37:19,381 --> 00:37:21,210
on the other side of the
camera for a long time,

753
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,730
who's a white male in his
probably late fifties.

754
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,070
He's done extremely good
work for a long time.

755
00:37:26,071 --> 00:37:29,250
He's working on a million TV shows that,
you know, well, he's, now, you know,

756
00:37:29,251 --> 00:37:31,800
the way it works with these shows is you
usually work a season or two and then

757
00:37:31,801 --> 00:37:32,730
you move on to something else.

758
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:35,970
Or there's huge gaps in between seasons
or what were some times you just work

759
00:37:35,971 --> 00:37:37,920
for a studio and they throw you
in all these different places.

760
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:42,960
He's telling me now that he's being
told by executives that as a white male,

761
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:44,370
as a straight white male,

762
00:37:44,371 --> 00:37:47,970
that basically he should either start
looking for other work or just don't

763
00:37:47,971 --> 00:37:49,170
expect to work anymore.

764
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:54,480
I mean think how actually dangerous
that is like dangerous people who have,

765
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:57,270
this is a good,
decent man who has worked his whole life,

766
00:37:57,271 --> 00:38:00,660
who was an extremely professional,
competent person.

767
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:02,560
But even if he was completely incompetent,
right.

768
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:05,520
You should not hire and bring
competence but not higher. No,

769
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:06,590
don't not hire him because

770
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:08,820
Henry Cavill,
I mean I think this is before you left,

771
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:11,180
you remember Henry Cavill
said about dating they,

772
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:13,180
I was having that he's
only going to date women.

773
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:16,040
He knows because he's afraid that he's
going to get caught in a me too situation

774
00:38:16,041 --> 00:38:20,420
just because he's rich and famous and
he got killed for that and I don't blame

775
00:38:20,421 --> 00:38:22,040
him for that. I mean, honestly
I can't blame somebody.

776
00:38:22,041 --> 00:38:24,760
Like if you're famous and
you have money to check,

777
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:28,510
like the pence rule works well
for, for everybody, right? Yeah.

778
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:30,120
Pence role like this it,
yeah.

779
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:33,190
Again, Susan harassing me. But
one other thing on this, you know,

780
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,970
they also don't realize how backwards
is actually gonna work because,

781
00:38:36,971 --> 00:38:40,150
so for example, I was just telling you,
we, we just hired a new full time here.

782
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:44,260
So I have a new assistant, Helen, who's
wonderful. And when we were hiring,

783
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:48,910
it did pop in my brain for a second.
But I would not want to hire a gay man.

784
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,550
I don't want to be,
not because I'm going to harass them,

785
00:38:51,551 --> 00:38:52,900
I'm not going to harass them.

786
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:56,860
But why would I hire someone who might
one day turn on me and that'd be like

787
00:38:56,861 --> 00:39:00,280
Dave harassed me. Now I happen to
be gay. So it seems that I made,

788
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:02,320
if I was gonna harass someone,
it would be a gay man. Right.

789
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:05,480
But I guess it could be a straight man
to or whatever. But it's like, you know,

790
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,400
so in a weird way and

791
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:08,580
well, my mom, it was him. I know.

792
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:10,940
It's like you come up with a
working woman and she say, I mean,

793
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:13,550
she literally worked, all my dad stayed
home. And I remember when I was young,

794
00:39:13,551 --> 00:39:17,780
she said, if ever you have an assistant
hire like a blue haired old lady. Yeah.

795
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:21,220
Specifically if you're saying this like
20 years, that's better way looking for.

796
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:25,520
All right. So let's see what else happened
while you were out? Oh, well, okay.

797
00:39:25,521 --> 00:39:28,130
So this was, this was a big
controversy. So Molly Tibbits, uh,

798
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:33,160
was a 20 year old Iowan
student at University of Iowa
and she was kidnapped and

799
00:39:34,401 --> 00:39:37,250
murdered by a guy who turned
out to be an illegal immigrant.

800
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:41,240
And this became a major cost celeb because
president Trump commented about it,

801
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:42,890
talking specifically about border policy.

802
00:39:42,891 --> 00:39:45,670
A lot of people on the right and jumped
on it perfectly about where was this?

803
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:47,990
I was in Iowa. Okay. And the,

804
00:39:47,991 --> 00:39:50,090
and the left suggesting of course
they had nothing to do with illegal

805
00:39:50,091 --> 00:39:51,590
immigration.
It was bad to talk about it.

806
00:39:51,591 --> 00:39:53,690
We should never talk about
this sort of thing. You know,

807
00:39:53,691 --> 00:39:55,360
the same left that says every
time there's a mass shooting,

808
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:58,580
we have to talk about gun control.
Now that you say when it comes to this,

809
00:39:58,581 --> 00:40:00,290
you can't talk about illegal immigration.

810
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:02,060
President Trump tweeted
incessantly about it.

811
00:40:02,061 --> 00:40:05,780
He cut a bunch of videos like from the
White House lawn and talking about it.

812
00:40:05,781 --> 00:40:08,980
And this became kind of political fodder.
The family said like,

813
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:10,910
we don't want any part of this,
please don't politicize it.

814
00:40:10,911 --> 00:40:13,780
She was on the left for families
on the left. Um, and uh,

815
00:40:13,781 --> 00:40:15,080
it turned into a bit of a Brouhaha.

816
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:17,800
Yeah. So where are we at
with this now? Like, hmm.

817
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:19,690
I mean the investigation at
the guy has been arrested,

818
00:40:19,691 --> 00:40:21,920
he's gonna go to jail presumably.
Uh,

819
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,720
but the sort of battle is less over
what happened in the case. And Moreover,

820
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:28,420
the politicization of
particular situations.

821
00:40:28,421 --> 00:40:31,690
Like should we be talking about broad
based policy based on individual

822
00:40:31,691 --> 00:40:36,040
circumstances? Uh, is it cynical to do
so? When is it appropriate to do so?

823
00:40:36,041 --> 00:40:37,880
So it sort of generated that
conversation. Yeah. Yeah.

824
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:39,500
I mean this is one of
the ones where it's like,

825
00:40:39,501 --> 00:40:44,501
this is exactly why I do this show to
talk about ideas and not every little

826
00:40:44,601 --> 00:40:46,580
instance of a thing that
happens. Now, of course this,

827
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:49,070
this sounds absolutely horrific,
but the way,

828
00:40:49,071 --> 00:40:53,330
like one thing that I really don't miss
after being away is like the three days

829
00:40:53,331 --> 00:40:55,610
that everyone cares
and then we don't care.

830
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,090
Net neutrality is going to destroy the
world. We scream about it for three days,

831
00:40:59,091 --> 00:41:00,950
then we forget about
children being separated.

832
00:41:00,951 --> 00:41:04,070
We scream about it for days and
it's also like everyone's screaming,

833
00:41:04,071 --> 00:41:06,320
not doing all the people that are,

834
00:41:06,321 --> 00:41:09,560
even the people that are getting 20,000
retweets on all the things that they're

835
00:41:09,561 --> 00:41:13,820
tweeting out. It's like, do, are you
doing anything about it? Now I get it.

836
00:41:13,821 --> 00:41:16,500
It's important to share your
thoughts and to talk. Um,

837
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:19,310
but one of the things that I really want
to do over the course of the next year

838
00:41:19,311 --> 00:41:22,910
is figuring out how do we put some of
this stuff into action because all we do

839
00:41:22,911 --> 00:41:25,460
is go from one crisis to another.
We pick this,

840
00:41:25,461 --> 00:41:27,890
it gets politicized by Trump
for immigration purposes.

841
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:31,430
It gets politicized over the other guys
for open borders or whatever it is.

842
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:35,210
And it's like nothing better
after that. Actually, we just,

843
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:38,930
we just kicked the can down the
road to hell like that. That Ah,

844
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:41,520
so we have a couple more kind of minor
ones and then there are a couple major

845
00:41:41,521 --> 00:41:43,290
ones to finish up with. Okay.
But on the other minor ones,

846
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:47,700
Ron Desantis candidate in Florida, so
he won his gubernatorial primary. Okay.

847
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:49,700
But the guy who ran against him,
uh,

848
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:52,140
if could one that primary
on the democratic side is
going to be Andrew Gillum,

849
00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:53,700
uh,
who's a black guy.

850
00:41:53,850 --> 00:41:58,850
And when desantis laid an interview very
early on talking about how Gilliam was

851
00:41:59,490 --> 00:42:02,770
a good candidate who had out debated
folks, uh, and he said, you know,

852
00:42:02,771 --> 00:42:05,550
we have a good economy now.
We don't need the guy who's a socialist.

853
00:42:05,551 --> 00:42:07,470
Cause Gillum is very far
to the left. Yeah. Element.

854
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:10,500
He says we don't need somebody who's a
socialist to come into and sort of monkey

855
00:42:10,501 --> 00:42:12,780
things up for the state of Florida.

856
00:42:13,050 --> 00:42:16,350
And this became a 48 hour
new cycle in which the,

857
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:21,240
this was accused of being a racist for
using the phrase monkey it up in regards

858
00:42:21,241 --> 00:42:25,170
to socialism,
screwing with the capitalist economy.

859
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:29,820
But he'd use the phrase monkey as a
verb and therefore he was obviously race

860
00:42:29,821 --> 00:42:32,700
baiting and,
and dog whistling to the evil racist too.

861
00:42:32,701 --> 00:42:34,090
Now we're gonna realize
Andrew Gillum is a black,

862
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:38,320
right, so allow me play this simple
son to my Jewish friend here. Um,

863
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:41,780
is there any evidence that he's an
actual racist beyond this common? Okay,

864
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:44,960
so this is like, remember when Howard
Cosell, it's a little before our time,

865
00:42:44,961 --> 00:42:49,250
but Howard Cosell got fired I think by
CBS news because during a football game,

866
00:42:49,251 --> 00:42:52,850
even though he was the thought of really
is the greatest sports broadcast or a

867
00:42:52,851 --> 00:42:56,170
regeneration, he said, well,
there was a, uh, a blah,

868
00:42:56,210 --> 00:42:59,840
it happened to be a black football player.
I like, uh, a running back or a, um,

869
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:00,921
I think it was a running back,

870
00:43:00,921 --> 00:43:03,170
jumped over a guy and he
said something about like,

871
00:43:03,171 --> 00:43:05,240
he's monkeying over him
or something like that.

872
00:43:05,690 --> 00:43:08,960
And everyone started calling him racist.
Now this is well before our days of now,

873
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:11,450
everybody's a racist and he
got fired because of that.

874
00:43:11,451 --> 00:43:13,910
It turned out that that's what he
called his grandchildren all the time.

875
00:43:13,910 --> 00:43:16,280
If I'm remembering the story correctly,
he was always saying, oh, your monkeys,

876
00:43:16,281 --> 00:43:18,380
your jumping all over each other and blah,
blah blah.

877
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:22,190
So this thing about a word and
that if we can get you on a word,

878
00:43:22,191 --> 00:43:24,050
we now know what your whole,

879
00:43:24,450 --> 00:43:28,730
cause it's not all your political ethos
that we know what your whole humanity is,

880
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:31,820
man. That is, that is so dangerous.

881
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:35,600
Everyone has mucked up a word every
now and again. And that, you know,

882
00:43:35,601 --> 00:43:37,370
everyone's intentions all the time.
I mean,

883
00:43:37,371 --> 00:43:39,820
this is one of the things that when when,
uh,

884
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:44,030
Sam Harris was first getting attacked
relentlessly by the left, it was like,

885
00:43:44,031 --> 00:43:46,460
they always would go after the way he,
it would be a toe.

886
00:43:46,461 --> 00:43:50,000
He said that word that way. Or if we
said this word, but you know, you,

887
00:43:50,090 --> 00:43:53,780
if you would have put a comma
there and it's like, man, you guys,

888
00:43:53,781 --> 00:43:57,950
you want to live in a world where we will
all be afraid to speak because we will

889
00:43:57,951 --> 00:44:00,950
all get to the point where, I mean,
again, it gets back to where we started,

890
00:44:00,951 --> 00:44:03,200
but all the good people will check out.

891
00:44:03,230 --> 00:44:06,050
You will never want to have a
political conversation with anyone.

892
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:09,110
The the areas for us to just be human.

893
00:44:09,111 --> 00:44:12,590
I know you've talked about this
a little bit to just be, okay.

894
00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:14,300
It's why I can't watch
sports center anymore

895
00:44:14,430 --> 00:44:18,210
so we can get to this story. See,
right. Here's the big sports story.

896
00:44:18,211 --> 00:44:21,780
So yesterday go,
Nike released its new ad campaign,

897
00:44:21,781 --> 00:44:23,670
the 30 year anniversary of just do it.

898
00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:28,770
It's face Colin Kaepernick and it
slogan and believe in something,

899
00:44:28,771 --> 00:44:32,520
even if it means sacrificing everything,
Hashtag just do it.

900
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:37,170
So he's the new fee. He hasn't played in
the NFL for two years. Yeah, he is. Uh,

901
00:44:37,230 --> 00:44:39,540
he obviously is famous for,
for kneeling, for the flag,

902
00:44:39,541 --> 00:44:41,830
but apparently he sacrificed
everything. He's, uh,

903
00:44:41,910 --> 00:44:45,820
he's going to get multimillions of dollars
in his own line of clothes, uh, in,

904
00:44:45,830 --> 00:44:49,500
in the Nike brand is of course is
create a great consternation. So that's,

905
00:44:49,501 --> 00:44:51,240
that's the big story.
The last 24 hours.

906
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:56,010
I mean, does this just prove, and I think
a few other people, I think, um, uh,

907
00:44:57,420 --> 00:45:00,900
what's his name? Oh Man, I'm blanking.
I'll get, I'll get in a second. Um, that,

908
00:45:00,901 --> 00:45:05,770
that this social justice thing just ruins
everything. Like it really did ruin, uh,

909
00:45:05,790 --> 00:45:09,560
ESPN. Yup. And that every time they
travel. Yeah. I'm sorry, clay traffic.

910
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:14,250
That's really how removed
I am. One second. I can't
remember friend's name. Um,

911
00:45:14,310 --> 00:45:17,210
that he just ruins everything that,

912
00:45:17,230 --> 00:45:21,270
that you're handing out sportsman of
the year awards to Caitlyn Jenner and

913
00:45:21,271 --> 00:45:25,320
you're doing all of these things in the
idea that you're being tolerant and good

914
00:45:25,321 --> 00:45:28,830
and you're actually doing nothing that
has anything to do with what your mission

915
00:45:28,831 --> 00:45:33,030
statement is. What is Nike's mission
statement? It's to put shoes and I guess,

916
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:36,750
you know, sports shirts on people so they
can be the best athletes they can be.

917
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:39,750
And I'm not saying they should be
completely a political like they should.

918
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:40,823
And again,
they can do whatever.

919
00:45:40,890 --> 00:45:42,920
Well, it's a capitalist. I
mean it's a capitalist move.

920
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:46,870
And if you look at the statistics,
either work does this water,

921
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:50,690
this whole drive. First of all,
it's viral marketing. Second of all,

922
00:45:50,691 --> 00:45:53,900
Nielsen shows that the people who are
most likely to engage in viral marketing

923
00:45:53,901 --> 00:45:56,590
on behalf of brands are actually black
folks in the United States. Yeah.

924
00:45:56,630 --> 00:45:57,890
And I did 44% more likely,

925
00:45:57,891 --> 00:46:01,160
I think according to Nielsen and black
folks in the United States are also

926
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:06,220
significantly more likely to be buying
clothing as a then then nonwhite folks in

927
00:46:06,861 --> 00:46:10,190
the United States according to a study
from University of Chicago, like clothing,

928
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:15,380
like expensive clothing. Okay. Per
per income level or income level.

929
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:18,820
Is there's an interesting something
to talk about their, yeah, they,

930
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:21,700
they've done studies on, it's really
interesting. Yeah. And uh, you know,

931
00:46:21,710 --> 00:46:22,850
is that a legacy of,

932
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:27,770
of one of the theories on that is that
it's a legacy of if you can't afford to

933
00:46:27,771 --> 00:46:29,900
show how rich you are
buying an expensive cars,

934
00:46:29,901 --> 00:46:33,080
did you buy an expensive pair of shoes?
It's 300 bucks as opposed to $35,000,

935
00:46:33,081 --> 00:46:36,050
for example. Um, but it's, but
there's, there's a lot there.

936
00:46:36,051 --> 00:46:38,540
And obviously in terms of
disproportionate sports,

937
00:46:38,541 --> 00:46:42,710
watching a young black men watch a lot
more sports than people of other races.

938
00:46:42,711 --> 00:46:44,750
So it makes a fair bit of marketing sense.

939
00:46:44,751 --> 00:46:49,130
But the funny part is the left falling
into the trap of now backing a massive

940
00:46:49,970 --> 00:46:52,790
international company. Yeah. Right.

941
00:46:52,791 --> 00:46:57,630
That is most famous for running
sweatshops in Asia. It's a capital,

942
00:46:57,631 --> 00:46:59,990
it's a really, again,
that's basically the story,

943
00:46:59,991 --> 00:47:02,660
but it's also obviously happening
because Trump's president right now,

944
00:47:02,661 --> 00:47:04,970
this happened two years ago,
if Hillary Clinton or president,

945
00:47:04,971 --> 00:47:06,560
they would not be doing
this with Colin Kaepernick.

946
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:10,540
Yeah. It's so, it's so interesting because
so last night it was my last night,

947
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:11,770
right.
And I have,

948
00:47:11,950 --> 00:47:14,300
I now you're sad. Right. And
I'm gonna want to miss my hope.

949
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:16,190
I hope we've almost
sufficiently ruined your life,

950
00:47:17,050 --> 00:47:19,620
I think. I think you have chance
to ruin it a little bit. No,

951
00:47:19,621 --> 00:47:22,280
but this is what it's all about. Right?
This is why I got off the [inaudible].

952
00:47:22,330 --> 00:47:25,020
Right. This is why I want to
do this with you. But, but,

953
00:47:25,021 --> 00:47:27,600
so the only thing that I did do,
so it's not that I watch no TV,

954
00:47:27,601 --> 00:47:30,160
but I watch movies or
watch Netflix or whatever.

955
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:34,840
So last night I watched, um, Avengers,
infinity war. I hadn't seen it before.

956
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:37,030
I thought the movie was
spectacular basically.

957
00:47:37,031 --> 00:47:39,250
I'm sure you've written up probably,
you've probably written a critique of it.

958
00:47:39,251 --> 00:47:41,900
I don't want to go too far into that,
but my only critique wise,

959
00:47:42,230 --> 00:47:46,090
we all know they're not dead. So that's
exactly right. Yeah. It's like no,

960
00:47:46,091 --> 00:47:51,000
Spiderman didn't just die, but okay.
Black Panther, their $1 billion. Right.

961
00:47:51,090 --> 00:47:55,040
So for property investment completely
right, but putting that aside,

962
00:47:55,070 --> 00:47:56,980
I thought it was a pretty great movie
in the way they could link everything

963
00:47:56,981 --> 00:48:00,940
together. The way I link this back to
what we're talking about right now is,

964
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:05,020
so mark Ruffalo, who plays the hulk in it,
he's a huge lefty, progressive, whatever,

965
00:48:05,021 --> 00:48:09,240
and he's babbling on politics all the
time and on Twitter and whatever. And I,

966
00:48:09,241 --> 00:48:10,510
you know,
I don't like attacking people,

967
00:48:10,511 --> 00:48:11,890
so I don't really want
to make this about him,

968
00:48:12,250 --> 00:48:14,920
but I think he's a pretty
bad actor in general.

969
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:16,750
Like I find him very
irritating as the hulk.

970
00:48:16,751 --> 00:48:19,840
I thought Edward Norton was a lot better
in the, in the previous incarnation,

971
00:48:20,350 --> 00:48:22,330
but after being away from
everything for a while,

972
00:48:22,331 --> 00:48:26,140
watching him knowing that here's this
guy that like really like politically I

973
00:48:26,141 --> 00:48:30,130
just think is just so annoying and gets
all these retweets on like stupid stuff

974
00:48:30,430 --> 00:48:33,610
and just share as all these what I
think are really bad ideas and whatever.

975
00:48:33,611 --> 00:48:37,450
And of course he can do it,
but like I was, every scene
that he was in, I was like,

976
00:48:37,510 --> 00:48:41,490
Ugh, like it actually kind
of like I love you. Like,

977
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:45,430
and then David said something which was
interesting. He was like, he's like,

978
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:47,230
you know, actors, of course
they can do whatever they want,

979
00:48:47,231 --> 00:48:49,840
but it's like if these guys would just
shut up and you didn't know anything

980
00:48:49,841 --> 00:48:54,130
about them, then they'd be doing
their craft properly. You know, like,

981
00:48:54,131 --> 00:48:56,890
and I think there's probably
like people that do that,

982
00:48:56,891 --> 00:48:59,880
that really avoiding the studio
theory for literally decades.

983
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:03,010
Let's keep that personal life away from
the papers and just the only thing you

984
00:49:03,011 --> 00:49:04,440
see on the screen is the
person on the screen. Yeah.

985
00:49:04,450 --> 00:49:06,620
Or some of them could be
more famous for some like,

986
00:49:06,670 --> 00:49:08,910
like a Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie.
Like there's like a,

987
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:10,240
there's like a separate area.

988
00:49:10,241 --> 00:49:14,440
You see how his career like took kitchen
ups and downs because of Brad Pitt oily

989
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:16,810
stuff and now with jelly and all this,
right.

990
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:20,320
But like these old button but that's more
about their relationships and whatever.

991
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:24,370
So that's one thing. But these overtly
political people all the time, especially,

992
00:49:24,371 --> 00:49:26,350
you know, I haven't thought about
any of these people in a long time,

993
00:49:26,351 --> 00:49:29,260
but a lot of the comedians that I used
to like that have now gone off the deep

994
00:49:29,261 --> 00:49:30,370
end.
Uh,

995
00:49:30,430 --> 00:49:34,750
politically it's like you guys have ruined
what I thought of your comedy because

996
00:49:34,751 --> 00:49:39,100
of the way you act and behave all
the time. Hey Lucy Kay's back.

997
00:49:39,250 --> 00:49:43,210
No shit getting crap for it and
really wait. What do you mean back?

998
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:45,820
Like he performed stand up club.
Okay,

999
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:48,010
well that that would be the natural
way to start. And how did it go?

1000
00:49:49,150 --> 00:49:52,390
He got a standing o but people
on the left were very, very,

1001
00:49:52,391 --> 00:49:55,330
very upset because he's not allowed to
come back yet because he hasn't served

1002
00:49:55,331 --> 00:49:59,580
his proper penance. Wow. So, so what,

1003
00:49:59,590 --> 00:50:03,490
so for a guy like you, so conservative,
I know obviously the actions that he did,

1004
00:50:03,491 --> 00:50:05,290
I'm sure you find
reprehensible and all that,

1005
00:50:05,590 --> 00:50:09,370
but I know you do believe in forgiveness
and I also think that there are levels

1006
00:50:09,371 --> 00:50:12,430
of reprehensible. So I think that
what he did is pretty reprehensible.

1007
00:50:12,430 --> 00:50:16,810
But what he did is not in the Harvey
Weinstein category of reprehensible from,

1008
00:50:16,811 --> 00:50:17,710
from what I can see.
Right.

1009
00:50:17,970 --> 00:50:21,340
So when you argue then that a guy
like Harvey Weinstein, there's no,

1010
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:25,630
I know he's probably not getting
[inaudible] actual rapists.

1011
00:50:25,631 --> 00:50:27,880
Nobody's watching actual rape
against the Lucy Kay right there.

1012
00:50:27,890 --> 00:50:30,530
They're arguing that he brought women
into his room and then jacked off in front

1013
00:50:30,531 --> 00:50:34,490
of them and then people
associate with say jacked off,

1014
00:50:34,491 --> 00:50:37,280
but you want to say fuck on
camera. That's, that's your policy.

1015
00:50:37,310 --> 00:50:41,900
And then I loosen virtually
all my policies, put him on
your show, it's your show.

1016
00:50:41,901 --> 00:50:45,560
So I curse a little bit. I was like,
shit on your shot, you want to say fuck,

1017
00:50:45,561 --> 00:50:48,350
you'll say shit. And it's
policy. Right. Exactly.

1018
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:53,070
It's like it's like network TV.
So it's uh,

1019
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:54,950
but uh,
yeah,

1020
00:50:54,951 --> 00:50:59,000
I think that in that if there's
a market for him to come back,

1021
00:50:59,001 --> 00:51:00,420
there's a market for him to come back.
I mean that's,

1022
00:51:00,470 --> 00:51:02,030
that's my general feeling for this.

1023
00:51:02,031 --> 00:51:04,340
And if people want to sue
him than they should to him.

1024
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:07,640
And if people want to like, this is how,
this is why we have a system of torts.

1025
00:51:07,641 --> 00:51:10,910
This is why we have a system. I mean, he
apologized for it. Presumably these women,

1026
00:51:11,030 --> 00:51:14,180
if they think that they can find evidence
that they were actively denied jobs

1027
00:51:14,181 --> 00:51:17,160
because of the Lucy Kay, they can see,
let me go funny. Right, exactly. Yeah.

1028
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:21,560
But this idea that we're going to put
people into kind of excommunication until

1029
00:51:21,561 --> 00:51:24,920
they come back and then we, again, it's
this variable excommunication right?

1030
00:51:24,921 --> 00:51:26,210
If you're,
if you're Mel Gibson,

1031
00:51:26,211 --> 00:51:28,250
it's a certain amount of time and
if it's a certain amount of time,

1032
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:30,200
can we used the kits like eight
months and for Mel Gibson,

1033
00:51:30,201 --> 00:51:33,140
it's like eight years and then eventually
you come back and daddy's home or

1034
00:51:33,141 --> 00:51:37,880
something. But is it, but I find all,
I have decent medic fields by the way.

1035
00:51:37,910 --> 00:51:40,340
Yeah.
Okay.

1036
00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:43,670
But there's something interesting there
because it's like if you don't like

1037
00:51:43,671 --> 00:51:46,310
Louis Ck, let's say you don't like him as
like, if you don't like him as a comic,

1038
00:51:46,311 --> 00:51:47,930
don't go to shows.
I like them as a person.

1039
00:51:47,931 --> 00:51:50,110
Don't go to shows if you don't like
what he did. Don't go to his show.

1040
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:53,900
It don't appear. Don't give him two
drinks and the cover charge, all that.

1041
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:54,920
Just don't do it.

1042
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:59,150
But this is so fundamentally why I
believe that live and let live is the only

1043
00:51:59,151 --> 00:52:04,130
way to actually have a functioning
society that all you can do is defend our

1044
00:52:04,131 --> 00:52:08,360
ability to be different. That's basically
it, because otherwise it should,

1045
00:52:08,361 --> 00:52:10,730
the man never be allowed to
work again. I mean, they,

1046
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:14,480
they say a lot of people say yes, right.
So shoot his wife be allowed to work,

1047
00:52:14,481 --> 00:52:16,750
should his children, you know what
I mean? It's like, all right, this,

1048
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:20,120
this is sort of like this
wind is repentance actually
take place because Bill

1049
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:24,290
Clinton is still held in wide as team
for doing a lot worse than, than Louis c.

1050
00:52:24,290 --> 00:52:27,710
K that's the crazy, well they did until
we'll get to that. Here's it. So there's,

1051
00:52:27,711 --> 00:52:31,250
we have three more headlines, so you're
good. Okay. So headline number one, uh,

1052
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:35,360
is a Risa Franklin died. So that was a
oh really? Yes. That was a big story.

1053
00:52:35,361 --> 00:52:38,600
And she had a huge funeral. Uh, it
was a 10 hour funeral, I believe.

1054
00:52:38,601 --> 00:52:40,220
Something like that.
It was really insane.

1055
00:52:40,450 --> 00:52:44,090
And they just got like every great singer
to a bunch of singers in there. And uh,

1056
00:52:44,110 --> 00:52:47,270
the, the kind of headline, the,
the politically oriented headlines,

1057
00:52:47,420 --> 00:52:50,840
Al Sharpton got up and bash
Trump and then there was a,

1058
00:52:50,841 --> 00:52:54,860
and then Bill Clinton was sitting
on stage next to, in order to his,

1059
00:52:54,861 --> 00:52:59,270
he had been to his right. So it was Jesse
Jackson, Al Sharpton. Louis Farrakhan.

1060
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:02,900
Ah, Shit. Yeah. Sitting, sitting
next to all three of them.

1061
00:53:03,530 --> 00:53:05,280
So that was one Clinton related headline.

1062
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:07,160
The other Clinton related
headline was more humorous,

1063
00:53:07,161 --> 00:53:09,050
which was Clinton who is a dirty old man.

1064
00:53:09,051 --> 00:53:11,090
It was a dirty old man when
he was a dirty young man. Uh,

1065
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:13,570
Ariana Grande's saying and
when she came up, yeah,

1066
00:53:13,590 --> 00:53:17,900
there's video of him legitimately
checking her out like up and down,

1067
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:21,800
full on, smiling, giggling,
like, like really going after it.

1068
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:26,130
I need find you somebody who looks at you
the way Bill Clinton looks like. Okay.

1069
00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:28,900
So let's, let's pause on that one. Cause
we all know Bill Clinton likes women.

1070
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:31,670
Let's just pause on that.
Let's go to the other ones.

1071
00:53:31,671 --> 00:53:34,890
Forget Jesse Jackson obviously and
forget Al Sharpton. I have whatever,

1072
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:38,330
forget that they're both both
antisemites but the lesser amount Korean

1073
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:39,610
antisemites they're,
you know,

1074
00:53:39,630 --> 00:53:41,850
I think Jews have learned
one thing over the millennia.

1075
00:53:41,851 --> 00:53:44,760
It's kind of like you got to pick the big
anti Semite to deal with good whatever.

1076
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:49,710
But like what he was on to see two or
three seats away from Louis Farrakhan.

1077
00:53:49,711 --> 00:53:52,800
Yeah. After this is to, I mean only
it was only two or three months ago.

1078
00:53:52,801 --> 00:53:56,700
Those insane tweets about Jews
being the devil and all that.

1079
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:00,730
Yeah, man. So he was it. So you use
there and then that was juxtaposed with,

1080
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:04,150
wait, wait, wait, did, was
there any, so of course
conservative media called him out.

1081
00:54:04,151 --> 00:54:05,860
Was there anything nobody else cared,
so nothing.

1082
00:54:05,861 --> 00:54:09,160
He probably didn't even make it on NBC
nightly news. Not as far as I know it was,

1083
00:54:09,170 --> 00:54:10,660
it was sort of just seen as
part of the thing. You know,

1084
00:54:10,661 --> 00:54:11,580
they're all the funerals together.

1085
00:54:11,590 --> 00:54:15,220
This is the bullshit that people can't
take anymore. This double standard,

1086
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:19,720
epic nonsense that every time a
Trump supporter does something,

1087
00:54:19,780 --> 00:54:22,000
everyone on the right should
apologize or whatever.

1088
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:25,360
And that this type of bullshit
the ex president sits with.

1089
00:54:25,361 --> 00:54:29,750
What I would argue is the, probably the
foremost, I was going to say preeminent,

1090
00:54:29,751 --> 00:54:32,740
the Anti Semite threats. So
that's probably to a dance, right?

1091
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:37,450
But like legitimately like a
disgusting human being who it's by,

1092
00:54:37,460 --> 00:54:42,280
by choosing to group up any group of
people in a specific way is the very

1093
00:54:42,281 --> 00:54:44,260
definition of prejudice
and racism and all that.

1094
00:54:44,410 --> 00:54:46,840
This is what the left is supposed to
be against. This is their whole thing.

1095
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:49,500
But that's what was going on.
So that was just,

1096
00:54:49,501 --> 00:54:52,260
what was it that happened on the same
day as the other big story was that John

1097
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:54,390
Mccain died. So that was, I'm
sure the one that you heard.

1098
00:54:54,430 --> 00:54:55,630
Okay,
so this is the one that,

1099
00:54:55,631 --> 00:54:58,810
I didn't know this until about two days
ago and I was on the phone with my dad

1100
00:54:58,811 --> 00:55:02,050
and I said, I said, you know,
we were talking about being
off the grid and I said,

1101
00:55:02,051 --> 00:55:05,110
you know, and I have, I don't know
anything. And he was as if he just like,

1102
00:55:05,170 --> 00:55:07,450
I don't know what has happened is healthy
and just see, but he goes, but you know,

1103
00:55:07,451 --> 00:55:08,770
John Mccain died and I was like,

1104
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:12,370
so they,
but did you know about [inaudible]

1105
00:55:12,590 --> 00:55:15,440
as you know? So I know, I know nothing
other than he does. So first off,

1106
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:17,900
I don't even know when he died.
They said justify or, sure. Two

1107
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:21,260
weeks, a week and a half ago. We can
only die to Saturday before last. Okay.

1108
00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:25,920
So [inaudible] Sabbath and, and
that was the news. So sorry,

1109
00:55:25,970 --> 00:55:29,330
he passed away. Uh, president
Trump obviously not a fan.

1110
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:33,140
And the first thing that it's a Trump
didn't issue any official statement for

1111
00:55:33,141 --> 00:55:35,520
two days. And then he, the,

1112
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:39,410
the basic rule of thumb is that when
a sitting senator dies, you lower the,

1113
00:55:39,490 --> 00:55:43,490
the flags to half staff until the
person is actually buried. Uh,

1114
00:55:43,670 --> 00:55:47,450
Trump did the statutory minimum.
He lowered the flag for 24 hours,

1115
00:55:47,451 --> 00:55:50,240
and then he raised it back up again.
All the other federal flags were lower,

1116
00:55:50,390 --> 00:55:52,820
but you could see a picture over the
White House of the flag back up at full

1117
00:55:52,821 --> 00:55:56,150
staff. And then at the Washington
monument, which can see behind it,

1118
00:55:56,330 --> 00:55:59,940
you see all of them down at half staff.
He then reversed himself rate,

1119
00:56:00,140 --> 00:56:04,430
lowered the flag again,
issued a statement. And then
at Mccain's funeral, uh,

1120
00:56:04,431 --> 00:56:06,360
he was not invited because
Mccain didn't horn in there,

1121
00:56:06,470 --> 00:56:11,090
which I can't really blame McCain for
that. And then at the funeral did,

1122
00:56:11,091 --> 00:56:14,090
George W spoke, Obama
spoke, Megan Mccain spoke,

1123
00:56:14,091 --> 00:56:18,870
all three of them took shots of Trump. So
Megan Mccain, so Megan Mccain said, uh,

1124
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:20,390
we didn't need to make
America great again.

1125
00:56:20,391 --> 00:56:24,130
America is already great
and kind of really went hard
after Trump. Wow. And then,

1126
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:25,660
uh,
Obama got up and he said,

1127
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:29,170
know our country was about all these
things here we can have the American creed

1128
00:56:29,171 --> 00:56:29,721
and we can,

1129
00:56:29,721 --> 00:56:33,690
and we're all part of the same America
and taking pretty obvious mail shots at

1130
00:56:33,691 --> 00:56:36,930
Trump. And then Bush did some of the
same sort of stuff. Wow. All right.

1131
00:56:36,970 --> 00:56:39,280
So that was it.
So that was yesterday or something,

1132
00:56:39,540 --> 00:56:41,310
a couple of things there.
First I find the flag thing.

1133
00:56:41,311 --> 00:56:42,630
I mean this is the tight look,
you know,

1134
00:56:42,631 --> 00:56:45,480
I think I've been pretty freaking fair
on Trump and I get a ton of shit for it.

1135
00:56:45,481 --> 00:56:47,810
I think you've been pretty fair on him.
You get a ton of ship port,

1136
00:56:48,030 --> 00:56:49,890
this type of thing.
Like this flag thing like that.

1137
00:56:49,891 --> 00:56:51,750
It's just like the non is childish.

1138
00:56:52,250 --> 00:56:56,370
That's just the child is nonsense that
looks like this should not be, it's your,

1139
00:56:56,371 --> 00:57:00,270
should not be. This is,
this is ridiculous. So let's
just move past that one.

1140
00:57:00,271 --> 00:57:03,690
That's it. First off, just quickly on
Megan Mccain, you know, I gotta tell you,

1141
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:08,490
I know Megan A. Little bit. Yeah,
we've met a couple of times and I,

1142
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:12,570
you know, there's a, there's a clip of
her about it probably about six years ago,

1143
00:57:12,571 --> 00:57:16,830
if not more at this point on real
time. Did you ever see this where, um,

1144
00:57:17,220 --> 00:57:21,270
she says something, she's in, she
gets in an argument. Paul Begala, uh,

1145
00:57:21,450 --> 00:57:24,690
is he a democratic strategists are
seeing it, yes. Is on the other side.

1146
00:57:24,691 --> 00:57:26,460
And they get into an
argument and she says, Oh,

1147
00:57:26,461 --> 00:57:29,970
you're just attacking me because I'm
young and I don't know everything about

1148
00:57:29,971 --> 00:57:32,610
World War II or something. He's like, I
wasn't alive during the French revolution,

1149
00:57:32,611 --> 00:57:35,430
but I know about that. And it gets
huge applause and it's a great line.

1150
00:57:35,431 --> 00:57:37,950
And it's like you can't use
your excuse of, um, if you're,

1151
00:57:38,010 --> 00:57:41,740
if you're a pundit or a whatever, then
be upon it. You can't. The second that,

1152
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:44,070
you know, it gets hot in the kitchen,
you can't be like, well, I'm young,

1153
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:47,220
I'm not supposed to be here. So I,
that's why I was very unimpressed.

1154
00:57:47,221 --> 00:57:49,500
That was the first time I probably
ever saw her publicly and I was very

1155
00:57:49,501 --> 00:57:50,071
unimpressed with her.

1156
00:57:50,071 --> 00:57:52,860
I've gotten to know her a little bit and
I'd watched some clips on the view and

1157
00:57:52,861 --> 00:57:56,640
my mom keeps calling me and telling
me that she's seen conservative.

1158
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:58,650
And I gotta tell you,
I'm very impressed by her.

1159
00:57:58,780 --> 00:58:00,060
Actually.
I'm very nation.

1160
00:58:00,061 --> 00:58:02,430
I used to be very much at odds and
in the last I'd say year and a half,

1161
00:58:02,431 --> 00:58:05,670
we become good at least friends.
Yeah. I'm glad to hear that.

1162
00:58:05,671 --> 00:58:08,490
That's because of this. I mean,
I think the cheese shifted. Yeah.

1163
00:58:08,491 --> 00:58:11,520
We've all shifted since we were young,
but I think that juice, she's shifted too,

1164
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:12,180
so,
yeah.

1165
00:58:12,180 --> 00:58:13,980
Wait, let me ask you anything. So, uh,

1166
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:17,010
I assume that the day he died
that there was the endless,

1167
00:58:17,190 --> 00:58:19,040
like people are dancing on his grave now.
Yeah.

1168
00:58:19,150 --> 00:58:20,530
So then that there was a,
there was some of that,

1169
00:58:20,531 --> 00:58:23,900
but mostly the left was praising him
because he was the antitrust throws it.

1170
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,970
So after spending most of his
life crapping all over him, right.

1171
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:30,790
The guy when he was racist, when he ran
for president and incompetent and old,

1172
00:58:30,791 --> 00:58:32,110
you know, and right, exactly.

1173
00:58:32,111 --> 00:58:35,110
Then he was a great hero because he was
an anti Trump and so his entire life was

1174
00:58:35,111 --> 00:58:37,180
defined by the fact that he
and Trump didn't get along.

1175
00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:41,250
So there was a lot of that, uh, you
know, my own take on this was that the,

1176
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:44,410
the funeral, well, I understand
Meghan Mccain's, a grieving daughter.

1177
00:58:44,411 --> 00:58:47,530
She had stayed over, she wants,
but that said, is it a smell?

1178
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:50,530
Let's say that you actively want
to undercut president Trump.

1179
00:58:50,550 --> 00:58:51,580
Let's say that that's actually your goal.

1180
00:58:51,581 --> 00:58:53,680
Your goal at this funeral is
that you want to, is that you,

1181
00:58:53,681 --> 00:58:55,780
you don't like what Trump stands
for and you want to undercut him.

1182
00:58:56,140 --> 00:58:59,050
Almost the worst thing you can
do is get George Shelby Bush,

1183
00:58:59,051 --> 00:59:01,150
Barack Obama and Megan Mccain
up there bashing Trump.

1184
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:04,660
And the reason for that is because the,
there is this,

1185
00:59:04,810 --> 00:59:07,720
what Trump is a response to is a sense
that there are a bunch of elites who get

1186
00:59:07,721 --> 00:59:10,420
together in back rooms and party with
each other and then they pretend to

1187
00:59:10,421 --> 00:59:13,570
disagree with each other for the cameras.
But in reality the crew,

1188
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:14,433
which is kind of true,
right?

1189
00:59:14,950 --> 00:59:18,220
But in reality they're back slapping each
other and they're all best friends and

1190
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:22,790
are civil and we all get along and and
then are kind of the commoners out here

1191
00:59:22,791 --> 00:59:24,620
where like, wait a second, these
issues actually matter to me.

1192
00:59:24,621 --> 00:59:26,090
Why do I care about your golf club?

1193
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:28,310
I don't care about George h
w being friends with Clinton.

1194
00:59:28,311 --> 00:59:31,100
I want to know like who wins this
political argument because it affects me,

1195
00:59:31,101 --> 00:59:32,720
right? I don't care about
like how you guys get along.

1196
00:59:32,990 --> 00:59:35,810
And so it was this feeling like there a
video that was going around to George w

1197
00:59:35,811 --> 00:59:37,820
handing Michelle Obama a piece
of candy. And I was like, well,

1198
00:59:37,821 --> 00:59:40,670
this is what politics used to be, and
I just kept thinking, no, it didn't.

1199
00:59:41,090 --> 00:59:43,910
I'm old enough to remember when
Barack Obama was labeling George W.

1200
00:59:43,910 --> 00:59:46,670
Bush essentially a war criminal,
and so you're going to do this whole,

1201
00:59:46,790 --> 00:59:49,880
Trump is a departure from everything
that politics has ever been.

1202
00:59:49,881 --> 00:59:53,930
It just felt really disingenuous.
Not because the criticism of Trump was,

1203
00:59:53,931 --> 00:59:55,910
was uncalled for because I
think some of it is called for,

1204
00:59:56,090 --> 01:00:00,050
but because it was creating this image
of politics that didn't exist and then

1205
01:00:00,051 --> 01:00:02,350
contracting Trump with this image of
politics, that's not actually right.

1206
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:02,881
Real so.

1207
01:00:02,881 --> 01:00:07,881
Isn't that an interesting example of why
the 24 hour news cycle or whatever you

1208
01:00:08,581 --> 01:00:11,650
call Twitter now or 24 hour news cycle
sounds crazy, but we need somebody else.

1209
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:15,480
This hyperspeed insanity of why it really,
it's,

1210
01:00:15,481 --> 01:00:20,190
it's a threat to our ability to think
clearly about things because the very

1211
01:00:20,191 --> 01:00:22,770
people who you hate it, eight
years ago, all these were not now.

1212
01:00:22,771 --> 01:00:25,150
I'm not saying it was warranted
than, yeah, I regret I will.

1213
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:26,250
I don't know that I've
ever said this publicly.

1214
01:00:26,251 --> 01:00:28,530
I regret not voting for
Mccain in retrospect.

1215
01:00:28,531 --> 01:00:31,860
I think that we'd be in a very different
place right now. And I think he was,

1216
01:00:31,950 --> 01:00:32,783
I think he was the,

1217
01:00:32,820 --> 01:00:37,820
he may be the last decent man that we
had running for president at least for a

1218
01:00:38,521 --> 01:00:41,670
long time as a decent guy. Ron.
Oh, Ron. Okay, so all right.

1219
01:00:41,671 --> 01:00:44,430
That might've been a little bit
of hyperbole, but if you remember,

1220
01:00:44,431 --> 01:00:47,270
he always wanted to go,
hi. He made her come here.

1221
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:50,260
High level mean he refused to go
with the Jeremiah Wright stuff.

1222
01:00:50,261 --> 01:00:53,520
He called off his campaign in the last
month because of the economic collapse.

1223
01:00:53,610 --> 01:00:57,690
Okay. So I'll, I'll modify that money
without commenting on Romney specifically.

1224
01:00:57,691 --> 01:01:01,350
Like I think by all, by all measures,
Mccain for whatever his flaws may be,

1225
01:01:01,351 --> 01:01:03,340
and maybe he was a little
more of a neocon than,

1226
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:05,400
than I would care for her
or whatever else it is.

1227
01:01:05,970 --> 01:01:09,330
It's like if you don't think he was a
decent man who really loved his country,

1228
01:01:09,331 --> 01:01:11,310
like you're,
you're actually crazy.

1229
01:01:11,580 --> 01:01:16,440
And this goes to when you demonize people
to the nth degree who don't deserve

1230
01:01:16,441 --> 01:01:18,960
demonization,
then you get the real demon.

1231
01:01:18,961 --> 01:01:22,920
And I'm not even saying Trump is the real
demon, but the way they flip history.

1232
01:01:23,010 --> 01:01:25,760
So it's like you hated
him forever and you,

1233
01:01:25,761 --> 01:01:27,420
you want it to destroy this guy forever.

1234
01:01:27,421 --> 01:01:30,540
Now he hates your new demon cause
you're always finding new demons.

1235
01:01:30,810 --> 01:01:33,510
So now we got a new good guy
and it's like, that's not,

1236
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:38,430
that's partly because we cannot remember
history anymore because we're slammed

1237
01:01:38,610 --> 01:01:42,480
with three day news stories that, you
know, I said it's 24 hour news cycle,

1238
01:01:42,481 --> 01:01:44,310
but it's really, it's, it's
more of like a three day thing.

1239
01:01:44,311 --> 01:01:47,010
We care for three days and then expunge,
you know,

1240
01:01:47,220 --> 01:01:51,990
and I think that that now is becoming
like the real threat right now.

1241
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:53,360
Okay.
So final news story for you,

1242
01:01:53,361 --> 01:01:55,950
and this would be the one that really
has ruined everybody's Day, but

1243
01:01:57,310 --> 01:02:00,050
that's great. So there's,
so there's a big scandal.

1244
01:02:00,060 --> 01:02:01,440
We don't have a bruise
on his head anymore.

1245
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:04,110
I'll hold the bottle of wine
there. But yeah, the, uh,

1246
01:02:04,620 --> 01:02:06,600
you're not gonna have wine
for this one and it's,

1247
01:02:06,601 --> 01:02:09,930
so basically there was a
big scandal in Pennsylvania.

1248
01:02:09,931 --> 01:02:12,900
There was a state attorney general report
that suggested that over the course of

1249
01:02:13,170 --> 01:02:13,831
30 years,

1250
01:02:13,831 --> 01:02:18,270
1000 children who've been molested by
Catholic priests and that these kit and

1251
01:02:18,271 --> 01:02:21,450
that these priests had then been around.
And then following on that,

1252
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:25,920
there's a guy named Archbishop Vergano.
Uh, and uh, he was the people in Lindsay,

1253
01:02:25,921 --> 01:02:26,191
I believe,

1254
01:02:26,191 --> 01:02:30,300
to the United States and he came forward
with an 11 page letter in which she

1255
01:02:30,301 --> 01:02:34,290
accused essentially the entire Vatican
hierarchy of being complicit in covering

1256
01:02:34,291 --> 01:02:37,590
off trout molestation, child rape, uh,

1257
01:02:37,591 --> 01:02:40,860
and what he suggested was a
growing weed in his terms,

1258
01:02:40,861 --> 01:02:44,130
homosexual subculture in the church when
she means by which he meant that there

1259
01:02:44,131 --> 01:02:47,190
was there particular cardinals who had
been accused of actually used to do sing

1260
01:02:47,191 --> 01:02:50,520
seminarians and all of this sort of thing.
Yeah. Let's just pause for one second.

1261
01:02:50,860 --> 01:02:54,000
[inaudible] linked those two things,
but I don't mean to sound Glib here,

1262
01:02:54,001 --> 01:02:56,070
but how is this sort of new,

1263
01:02:56,460 --> 01:02:59,580
so it's only new in that he is accusing
Pope Francis of actively covering it up.

1264
01:02:59,610 --> 01:03:02,130
Oh, okay. So he's saying that
there's a cardinal McCarrick who was,

1265
01:03:02,131 --> 01:03:03,450
who was complicit,

1266
01:03:03,460 --> 01:03:07,050
who was apparently accused of child
molestation or at least molestation of

1267
01:03:07,060 --> 01:03:11,520
underage seminarians, basically.
Uh, and this and this guy,

1268
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:14,730
artificial Degano said Pope
Francis not only knew about it,

1269
01:03:14,731 --> 01:03:16,210
he reinstated McCarrick embedded,

1270
01:03:16,220 --> 01:03:21,220
acted basically put the guy in in
silence and prayer and that Francis had

1271
01:03:21,901 --> 01:03:24,150
brought the guy back and made
him a public figure again,

1272
01:03:24,151 --> 01:03:27,760
it had done so with multiple
other similar figures. Uh,

1273
01:03:27,780 --> 01:03:29,400
and because Francis,

1274
01:03:29,401 --> 01:03:32,790
the accusation is soft on homosexuality
inside the Catholic Church,

1275
01:03:33,270 --> 01:03:35,250
that's his accusation,
but Ganos uh,

1276
01:03:35,251 --> 01:03:39,450
and then by extension soft on people who
had been molested seminarians and also

1277
01:03:39,451 --> 01:03:42,870
happened to be homosexual, uh,
or practicing homosexuality. So,

1278
01:03:42,970 --> 01:03:45,710
so I, uh, okay. So all right.

1279
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:50,530
[inaudible] they conflated
here. So a couple of things
being completed. One is, uh,

1280
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:53,390
people are suggesting that,
um,

1281
01:03:53,420 --> 01:03:56,660
the reason that this is all happening is
because anti gay feelings in the church

1282
01:03:56,661 --> 01:04:00,860
are leading people to go after Francis
or leading people to go after McCarrick.

1283
01:04:01,190 --> 01:04:01,550
I,

1284
01:04:01,550 --> 01:04:05,480
and that's a weird argument because really
what we should all be able to say is

1285
01:04:05,481 --> 01:04:07,400
that a few things can be true.
One,

1286
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:11,810
there's no statistical linkage between
homosexuality and child molestation.

1287
01:04:11,830 --> 01:04:14,630
Right.
Obviously to that,

1288
01:04:14,690 --> 01:04:17,390
a disproportionate number of the people
who have been molested inside the

1289
01:04:17,391 --> 01:04:19,640
Catholic church had been young
boys. Yeah. Which is also true.

1290
01:04:19,641 --> 01:04:24,641
It's four out of five and three that any
pope who covers this crap up should be

1291
01:04:25,131 --> 01:04:29,420
criminally liable basically.
And the media, it's like
paternal, I mean, exactly.

1292
01:04:29,470 --> 01:04:33,410
And you know, this exist in pretty
much every major institution,

1293
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:34,790
secular or religious.

1294
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:38,390
There's always an attempt to cover up
sins inside that particular institution.

1295
01:04:38,540 --> 01:04:40,970
This is true for every religious
institution that I know about.

1296
01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:44,210
Pretty sure it's true for every
institution. Public schools,

1297
01:04:44,211 --> 01:04:45,700
like legitimately every
institution button.

1298
01:04:45,940 --> 01:04:48,640
So you tried to cover up
the whole, uh, you know,

1299
01:04:48,820 --> 01:04:50,580
trying to take out Bernie
thing that was driving.

1300
01:04:51,540 --> 01:04:54,420
So, the, so the, but the,
the part of this story,

1301
01:04:54,421 --> 01:04:58,120
the twist to the story where the good
part that's new is not only that for,

1302
01:04:58,140 --> 01:05:01,320
it's a Francis stayed silent, he's refused
to respond to any of the allegations.

1303
01:05:01,710 --> 01:05:04,830
Uh, it's, the allegation has been
backed by a bunch of other testimony.

1304
01:05:05,100 --> 01:05:07,590
Bishops are basically going to war with
one another for the first time in 500

1305
01:05:07,591 --> 01:05:11,900
years. Like they're openly criticizing
each other. Wow. And the, and I think the,

1306
01:05:11,901 --> 01:05:16,290
the most shocking thing is that the
media are running full scale editorials

1307
01:05:16,291 --> 01:05:19,360
attacking the quote unquote
ultra conservative wing
within the Catholic Church

1308
01:05:19,361 --> 01:05:20,350
for going after Francis.

1309
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:25,260
So the same media that back in 2003
was going after John Paul two. Yeah.

1310
01:05:25,380 --> 01:05:26,021
And saying,

1311
01:05:26,021 --> 01:05:30,320
and benedict and saying these guys are
responsible for all of this and they

1312
01:05:30,321 --> 01:05:30,520
should,

1313
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:33,610
now they're defending Francis specifically
because they think that this is a

1314
01:05:33,611 --> 01:05:36,130
conservative attempt to ask Frances
because Frances a liberal pub.

1315
01:05:36,680 --> 01:05:39,290
So, okay. So basically
the media is trying to,

1316
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:42,710
he's because he's a little more
pro gay, so to speak, whatever that

1317
01:05:42,750 --> 01:05:46,670
all that middle environmentalist and
he's more of a selection in general legal

1318
01:05:46,671 --> 01:05:47,860
immigration and all that stuff.
Yeah.

1319
01:05:48,120 --> 01:05:51,570
So the media oddly is
trying to protect him, man.

1320
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:55,500
I mean this again it goes to this thing
of like we are enemies will be our

1321
01:05:55,501 --> 01:05:58,740
friends the second we need them and
then we'll throw them out and what,

1322
01:05:58,741 --> 01:05:59,820
I mean this is just sounds

1323
01:06:00,170 --> 01:06:04,160
awful. It's awful. Yeah. I
mean it's like a 500 years.

1324
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:07,370
It could cause a 500 years can schism in
the church like the worst schism in the

1325
01:06:07,371 --> 01:06:09,790
church since maybe the
Protestant reformation. Yeah.

1326
01:06:09,860 --> 01:06:12,920
Because there's like an entire wing of
the church because you can't impeach the

1327
01:06:12,921 --> 01:06:14,960
pope. There's entire,
we'll get the church going.

1328
01:06:15,020 --> 01:06:20,020
The Vatican hierarchy covered this stuff
up because they cover this stuff up and

1329
01:06:20,481 --> 01:06:23,450
now he's being defended by a bunch of
people who aren't real fond of Catholics

1330
01:06:23,451 --> 01:06:27,170
in general. Yeah. But somehow have
now found enthusiasm for Pope Francis.

1331
01:06:27,310 --> 01:06:31,360
If you were, if you were Catholic
and, and you were a real believer,

1332
01:06:31,361 --> 01:06:34,150
but obviously didn't stand
for any of this of course.

1333
01:06:34,300 --> 01:06:36,520
But let's just say you're the average
Catholic out there. Who's a good,

1334
01:06:36,521 --> 01:06:38,620
decent person.
You happen to be older believer,

1335
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:42,100
I would assume the way you believe
in Judaism, it's okay. So let's say,

1336
01:06:42,101 --> 01:06:45,430
let's say you're that now Judaism, I know
it doesn't have a structure like that.

1337
01:06:45,431 --> 01:06:45,500
Yeah.

1338
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:50,380
That's all I'm doing is any rabbi
[inaudible]. I mean, I don't know.

1339
01:06:50,830 --> 01:06:51,890
I'll see you in the Jewish community.

1340
01:06:51,891 --> 01:06:53,180
I don't know who Catholic
doctrine warranty.

1341
01:06:53,260 --> 01:06:55,520
You don't have papal
infallibility and Judaism. Yeah.

1342
01:06:55,610 --> 01:06:58,610
Any rabbi who complicit in the cover up
of child molestation should immediately

1343
01:06:58,611 --> 01:07:00,190
go to jail. Yeah. I mean like the, the,

1344
01:07:00,250 --> 01:07:02,310
I have no tolerance for this
kind of bullshit. And the,

1345
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:05,810
and the fact that this is not only
being tolerated but forwarded by certain

1346
01:07:05,811 --> 01:07:07,430
members of the press is
an astonishing thing.

1347
01:07:07,431 --> 01:07:10,460
And it's the same people who are
getting spotlight an Oscar, right?

1348
01:07:10,940 --> 01:07:12,170
Five years ago. Right, right.

1349
01:07:12,171 --> 01:07:14,390
Because it was so important to uncover
all this stuff happening within the

1350
01:07:14,391 --> 01:07:17,030
church and now it's no guy hands off.
I mean,

1351
01:07:17,031 --> 01:07:19,400
France is really important figure and
the fact that all these people are

1352
01:07:19,401 --> 01:07:22,730
attacking him, we can't take it seriously
for political reasons. We have to,

1353
01:07:22,731 --> 01:07:24,740
we have to suggest that it's
just a hit job against Francis.

1354
01:07:24,790 --> 01:07:28,930
Do you think there's like sort of like,
this is just another extension of,

1355
01:07:28,931 --> 01:07:30,310
as we've,
over the last couple of years,

1356
01:07:30,311 --> 01:07:32,740
just watched all of these
institutions crumble.

1357
01:07:32,741 --> 01:07:34,570
Like we've watched
mainstream media crumble.

1358
01:07:34,690 --> 01:07:36,490
We're watching our political institutions,

1359
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:39,830
I don't know that they're quite crumbling,
but they're, they're [inaudible],

1360
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:40,810
they're teetering certainly.

1361
01:07:40,811 --> 01:07:43,960
But shifting in nature and also like
the legislative branch is basically

1362
01:07:43,961 --> 01:07:47,050
becoming a useless, nothing is
as worse as we're right as we're,

1363
01:07:47,080 --> 01:07:49,540
as we're handing everything
over to the king. Uh,

1364
01:07:49,541 --> 01:07:51,670
another good reason to
be for small government,

1365
01:07:51,671 --> 01:07:55,450
either classical liberal or
libertarian, etc. Um, but that,

1366
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:57,100
that this with the church without,

1367
01:07:57,101 --> 01:07:59,410
without making it too specific
about these specific things,

1368
01:07:59,950 --> 01:08:02,800
that it's just another one of these
things that these giant institutions that

1369
01:08:02,801 --> 01:08:06,130
used to be able to control narrative
control gatekeeping and all of that,

1370
01:08:06,430 --> 01:08:09,850
they actually cannot withstand
things anymore. Sort of,

1371
01:08:09,910 --> 01:08:12,100
I mean this is where I've been sort of
critical at the Internet and the way

1372
01:08:12,101 --> 01:08:16,100
we're all behaving on there,
but like truth does find a way.

1373
01:08:16,490 --> 01:08:21,490
So then we watch these institutions try
to attack the people because the people

1374
01:08:21,711 --> 01:08:25,730
have a better essence of what the truth
is then be institutions or am I getting

1375
01:08:25,731 --> 01:08:27,540
something there?
And that's exactly right in the,

1376
01:08:27,550 --> 01:08:31,190
in the fact that it's the most shocking
performance by the press that I've seen,

1377
01:08:31,191 --> 01:08:35,270
including anything with regard to Trump
to shift to shift on a dime and start

1378
01:08:35,271 --> 01:08:36,310
going,
well you know what,

1379
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:38,930
let's go check out these allegations of
child molestation cause we really liked

1380
01:08:38,931 --> 01:08:42,560
this pope. It's like, Whoa, that's,
that's, that's pretty amazing stuff.

1381
01:08:42,561 --> 01:08:44,540
And I'm talking not, I'm not
talking about the editorial boards,

1382
01:08:44,541 --> 01:08:47,110
I'm talking about objective news
coverage, objective news coverage. Yeah.

1383
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:51,230
There was a headline in the New York
Times that said Pope Francis takes high

1384
01:08:51,231 --> 01:08:52,700
road as conservatives pounds,

1385
01:08:53,420 --> 01:08:57,980
man over allegations of covering up
sexual abuse of seminarians in, in mind.

1386
01:08:58,020 --> 01:09:00,350
First it's, it's, it's totally
wild. I mean, I think we,

1387
01:09:00,351 --> 01:09:04,130
this is just part and parcel with what
we've watched sort of happen to the New

1388
01:09:04,130 --> 01:09:06,020
York Times over the last couple
of years. I mean, you know,

1389
01:09:06,021 --> 01:09:07,210
I've said this many times,
but I,

1390
01:09:07,220 --> 01:09:11,240
I'm pretty sure the New York Times didn't
cover Bret Weinstein at evergreen once

1391
01:09:11,270 --> 01:09:15,500
in the pages of the paper, but did three
or four editorials about it. You know,

1392
01:09:15,501 --> 01:09:15,921
they,

1393
01:09:15,921 --> 01:09:20,240
they constantly do this type of thing
where it's like they're editorializing

1394
01:09:20,241 --> 01:09:23,480
their entire coverage often
by what they're not covering.

1395
01:09:23,840 --> 01:09:28,460
And so to watch this was
an important institution,

1396
01:09:28,461 --> 01:09:30,560
I think for a long time kind
of crumble like that. And I,

1397
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:34,700
this gets us back to that story 20 this
gets us back to story one where now

1398
01:09:34,710 --> 01:09:36,910
you're going to bring in
people to actually, instead,

1399
01:09:36,911 --> 01:09:39,470
this is where when people say,
Dave, you attack the left too much.

1400
01:09:39,471 --> 01:09:41,660
You don't have to talk the right.
It's like the right,

1401
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:44,330
this isn't about institutional
power anymore at some,

1402
01:09:44,390 --> 01:09:45,950
at some old Trump's the president,
I get it.

1403
01:09:46,220 --> 01:09:49,280
But like the left has all this
media power and all everything else,

1404
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:52,940
and you're willingly bringing
in people that truly are racist.

1405
01:09:52,941 --> 01:09:56,630
Or if without calling these
people specifically racist, have,

1406
01:09:56,660 --> 01:09:59,150
have terrible ideas.
And you're saying this is,

1407
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:01,430
this is part of what mainstream should be.

1408
01:10:01,431 --> 01:10:05,910
So you're mainstreaming what would
a really radical ideas. All righty.

1409
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:10,250
Yes. Yeah. Got You. Got
You. There it is. Okay.

1410
01:10:10,251 --> 01:10:13,520
So submit your questions for me and for
Dave on Patrion and super chat right now.

1411
01:10:13,521 --> 01:10:15,410
We're going to take a quick break and
then we'll be right back with those

1412
01:10:15,411 --> 01:10:16,730
questions.
Oh Man.

1413
01:10:37,220 --> 01:10:38,053
Wow.

1414
01:10:46,290 --> 01:10:51,290
[inaudible]

1415
01:11:30,230 --> 01:11:32,990
[inaudible]

1416
01:12:01,430 --> 01:12:06,430
[inaudible] [inaudible]

1417
01:12:40,210 --> 01:12:45,210
[inaudible] whoa.

1418
01:13:04,570 --> 01:13:09,570
[inaudible] [inaudible]

1419
01:13:58,820 --> 01:14:03,820
[inaudible] [inaudible]

1420
01:14:09,470 --> 01:14:11,850
[inaudible]

1421
01:14:34,870 --> 01:14:35,703
okay,

1422
01:15:15,490 --> 01:15:18,040
well we're back at the Ben Shapiro report.
That's all right.

1423
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:21,460
I'm hosting today because Dave is just
back and if you missed it earlier,

1424
01:15:21,461 --> 01:15:22,350
we went through all of the news.

1425
01:15:22,351 --> 01:15:25,570
So Dave is markedly more depressed
than he was an hour and a half ago,

1426
01:15:25,571 --> 01:15:28,870
which makes me happy since I'm a status.
So let's run a tight ship. By the way,

1427
01:15:28,871 --> 01:15:31,000
when I do the breaks in between
the interview in the live show,

1428
01:15:31,001 --> 01:15:32,980
it ends up being like,
I always say we'll be back in 30 seconds.

1429
01:15:32,981 --> 01:15:35,200
It's like seven minutes.
You were like, well come on.

1430
01:15:35,201 --> 01:15:37,870
I mean we've got to make money. So it's
fast and you move. That's exactly right.

1431
01:15:37,871 --> 01:15:40,030
So we've got patrion questions
and super chat questions.

1432
01:15:40,300 --> 01:15:42,670
So let's start with the
patriarch question. Dave,

1433
01:15:42,671 --> 01:15:45,610
do you think there's any turning back
from the politicization of literally

1434
01:15:45,611 --> 01:15:47,560
everything fun or is
this the new norm now?

1435
01:15:48,220 --> 01:15:52,870
I think for now it is the new norm and
I think that we have to get through this

1436
01:15:52,871 --> 01:15:57,160
and I think we can get through it. I'm
telling you, as I said to you an hour ago,

1437
01:15:57,250 --> 01:16:01,990
I spent the last month talking to
real people all over the place. Ray,

1438
01:16:01,991 --> 01:16:04,430
I would literally on the street,
like if I just saw it,

1439
01:16:04,440 --> 01:16:07,090
like if I was just standing there, I
just talked to, I was just talking to me,

1440
01:16:07,091 --> 01:16:10,180
but I really felt like I could be
a little more connected to people.

1441
01:16:10,420 --> 01:16:14,620
People don't want everything to be
politicized all the time. They don't want,

1442
01:16:14,621 --> 01:16:18,610
why do you watch sports? It's not for
politics. Why do you watch the Avengers?

1443
01:16:18,611 --> 01:16:23,260
It's not for politics. Why any most of
the things you do, it's not for politics.

1444
01:16:23,261 --> 01:16:26,650
And the fact that they've let this
creep into everything too. It's,

1445
01:16:26,690 --> 01:16:29,850
it's just another, and when I say day
it's like there's this a morphous thing.

1446
01:16:29,860 --> 01:16:32,880
I'm not a sports media. Yeah. And I don't
know that it's, it's cool. You know,

1447
01:16:32,890 --> 01:16:35,710
a fully, I think there is some level
of coordination in different ways,

1448
01:16:36,070 --> 01:16:38,830
but like I'm not saying there's like a
group of four or five guys sitting in a

1449
01:16:38,831 --> 01:16:41,680
room like how do we divide America and
destroy everything? Maybe there is,

1450
01:16:41,681 --> 01:16:42,011
I don't know,

1451
01:16:42,011 --> 01:16:47,011
but like this endless thing where we
just are going to hate each other all the

1452
01:16:47,021 --> 01:16:50,890
time. And this is why I've said it
before, but like this is why I truly,

1453
01:16:50,891 --> 01:16:52,930
truly believe,
I believe it now more than ever,

1454
01:16:53,140 --> 01:16:58,140
identity politics is the biggest
threat that a free society has and is

1455
01:16:58,870 --> 01:17:02,650
particularly our free society because
we've done the melting pot better than

1456
01:17:02,680 --> 01:17:06,520
anybody. We did a melting pot, we did
it right. We blended this thing right.

1457
01:17:06,521 --> 01:17:08,950
Everyone still wants to
come here for a better.

1458
01:17:09,380 --> 01:17:11,540
All these celebrities that always tweet,
they're going to leave.

1459
01:17:11,541 --> 01:17:15,740
Nobody ever leaves. And the same people
who will tell you what a racist, evil,

1460
01:17:15,741 --> 01:17:19,460
patriarchal, homophobic,
transphobic society America is.

1461
01:17:19,461 --> 01:17:22,160
They're the same people who want open
borders because they want apparently

1462
01:17:22,161 --> 01:17:26,900
everyone to come in and share in the Harz.
So I think it's truly, it is a threat.

1463
01:17:26,901 --> 01:17:28,880
But yes,
I think we will get past it.

1464
01:17:28,881 --> 01:17:33,830
And the reason I'm hopeful is because
when we look at all of the mainstream

1465
01:17:33,831 --> 01:17:35,900
media that's peddling
this stuff crumbling,

1466
01:17:35,901 --> 01:17:39,440
and we look at the amount of people
that are listening to long form

1467
01:17:39,441 --> 01:17:42,410
conversations and getting
what their ideas are. I mean,

1468
01:17:42,411 --> 01:17:45,250
when I go to these Peterson things and
people come up to me and say, you know, I,

1469
01:17:45,251 --> 01:17:49,580
I started watching your show and then
I saw Shapiro on there and Harris and

1470
01:17:49,581 --> 01:17:50,720
Peterson and blah blah blah.

1471
01:17:50,721 --> 01:17:53,600
And I started thinking about things
differently and then I bought Peterson's

1472
01:17:53,601 --> 01:17:56,570
book. And you know what, I
I stopped smoking weed or

1473
01:17:56,630 --> 01:17:58,730
yeah. Yeah. I'm not even
saying smoking weed is bad.

1474
01:17:58,731 --> 01:18:00,820
I know we have a difference of opinion
on the lines based on this stuff. Yeah.

1475
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:04,190
So I really believe that
while you can't see it,

1476
01:18:04,191 --> 01:18:07,670
if you just look at that online tier,
that in reality,

1477
01:18:07,671 --> 01:18:09,770
I think there is something
incredibly good happening.

1478
01:18:09,810 --> 01:18:13,900
Okay. So here's the super chat
question for you. Uh, let's see. Um,

1479
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:16,050
it says love the do this one's
interesting. Love the two of you.

1480
01:18:16,051 --> 01:18:18,450
You both converted as socialist
into a libertarian conservative,

1481
01:18:18,451 --> 01:18:22,080
awful about Russian Shapiro.
Will you bake Ruben a wedding cake?

1482
01:18:23,110 --> 01:18:28,080
Okay, so my answer is I'm married
already, right? But an adverse,

1483
01:18:28,081 --> 01:18:31,110
or I buy my anniversary last week and
anniversary cake would have been nice.

1484
01:18:31,140 --> 01:18:34,200
Right? So I, so the answer is no.

1485
01:18:34,590 --> 01:18:36,820
And the reason I won't is because
it's a religious Jew. I, yeah.

1486
01:18:36,870 --> 01:18:41,550
I do not participate in activities
that I believe are sinful. But again,

1487
01:18:41,551 --> 01:18:43,470
we live in a free country
and Dave knows this.

1488
01:18:43,710 --> 01:18:45,570
He doesn't have to care
what I think about sin.

1489
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:49,060
And as long as I'm not bothering Dave,
I don't see why it's a problem. Yeah,

1490
01:18:49,220 --> 01:18:53,820
it will. I will. I did. Does Dave have
a husband? Yeah. I mean like, okay.

1491
01:18:53,821 --> 01:18:54,720
And Are we friends?
Yeah.

1492
01:18:54,721 --> 01:18:57,680
And Are we gonna go out to dinner
sometime in the near future? Yeah.

1493
01:18:57,950 --> 01:19:02,790
But there's a difference between me just
being friends with Dave and me actively

1494
01:19:03,510 --> 01:19:06,840
participating in an event that
I feel is religiously sinful.

1495
01:19:06,900 --> 01:19:09,960
And I think this is how most religious
Christians in most religious Jews feel.

1496
01:19:10,230 --> 01:19:12,840
And while at awkward, yeah, we're
still friends in spite of it,

1497
01:19:12,841 --> 01:19:15,450
which is why we're friends, friends, in
spite of it, then it'd be a bad thing

1498
01:19:15,730 --> 01:19:19,630
when I, when I did your interview show,
which by the way, I mean, yeah, you Jack,

1499
01:19:19,631 --> 01:19:21,790
the idea of an interview show front
of me, it's all right. It's true,

1500
01:19:21,820 --> 01:19:25,780
but nobody has done it before me.
Um, but what you said that to me in,

1501
01:19:25,810 --> 01:19:29,810
and I truly mean this, like if you
think what I'm doing is sinful, like I,

1502
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:34,580
I know it sounds Glib, but
I don't care. I you is,

1503
01:19:34,670 --> 01:19:37,720
you don't have to care, right. Free
Country, right? Like that's the thing.

1504
01:19:37,721 --> 01:19:40,870
And it's like, look, look, there is,

1505
01:19:41,020 --> 01:19:42,760
of course someone's going to go,
well wait a minute.

1506
01:19:42,761 --> 01:19:45,980
If you really think his marriage is
sinful are saying, of course they'll,

1507
01:19:46,010 --> 01:19:50,050
they'll may be a place that in the nature
of our friendship maybe that we can't

1508
01:19:50,051 --> 01:19:50,861
quite get to,

1509
01:19:50,861 --> 01:19:53,680
that I would be able to get to with
someone that didn't think for sure.

1510
01:19:53,950 --> 01:19:56,860
That is very possible. And, and
it, and it goes both ways, right?

1511
01:19:56,861 --> 01:20:00,070
Like I then look at you and I go,
well why

1512
01:20:00,440 --> 01:20:01,031
that's a kid.

1513
01:20:01,031 --> 01:20:03,880
You don't want me teaching your kid about
the nature of family perhaps, right?

1514
01:20:03,881 --> 01:20:05,530
I mean like, like there are
some lead, but I just put,

1515
01:20:05,531 --> 01:20:08,150
you're probably a pretty good dad.
Like, you know what I mean? Like we,

1516
01:20:08,220 --> 01:20:11,850
but why is it that we're able to do this?

1517
01:20:12,060 --> 01:20:14,890
And most people can't do this? That's
what I'm curious about. Hold on.

1518
01:20:15,090 --> 01:20:17,470
And we can have our own lives.
I mean that's, that's real.

1519
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:20,070
And I think part of friendship by the
way is that like we go home at night and

1520
01:20:20,071 --> 01:20:22,230
we just have our own lives. Yeah.
I'm not married to you. Right.

1521
01:20:22,231 --> 01:20:24,750
And like that's like my wife and
I have to agree on these issues.

1522
01:20:24,751 --> 01:20:27,360
You and I don't have to agree on these
issues in order for us to share a common

1523
01:20:27,361 --> 01:20:27,991
space together.

1524
01:20:27,991 --> 01:20:30,300
And that's really the important thing
that your wife and you have to agree on

1525
01:20:30,301 --> 01:20:33,240
these, on all of these
issues or just the sort of,

1526
01:20:33,700 --> 01:20:35,700
the more foundational and
the foundational ones.

1527
01:20:35,700 --> 01:20:39,440
But I do think that how you raise your
kids religiously and with regards to

1528
01:20:39,490 --> 01:20:42,780
things like sexual morality does
actually have to be at the root of,

1529
01:20:42,790 --> 01:20:45,210
of how you teach your kids.
So if you have deep,

1530
01:20:45,480 --> 01:20:48,450
if you have deep divisions with your
spouse on these issues, I think that,

1531
01:20:48,570 --> 01:20:50,310
and you're looking to
build a family anyway,

1532
01:20:50,700 --> 01:20:54,390
then I think that these are issues where
building on a bad foundation is a bad

1533
01:20:54,391 --> 01:20:57,480
move. So let me, okay, so if you
wouldn't bake me a cake, that's okay.

1534
01:20:57,690 --> 01:20:59,520
Now because it's 50,
50,

1535
01:20:59,521 --> 01:21:02,910
I can't bake you a cake
with David's trouble chef.

1536
01:21:02,911 --> 01:21:06,660
And He would've done it coaching the
whole, wow. Now I feel bad for you.

1537
01:21:06,690 --> 01:21:09,540
You got me this clothes.
Putting that aside, you can't
have any bids. Kosher cake.

1538
01:21:09,541 --> 01:21:12,810
Now, um, if we were having an
anniversary party, would you come?

1539
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:15,570
If I was inviting all the crew that we
all know and we were just an anniversary

1540
01:21:15,571 --> 01:21:17,460
party,
we're just having a party and a,

1541
01:21:17,461 --> 01:21:20,100
and I'll even throw in some kosher food
for you to make sure you don't have to

1542
01:21:20,101 --> 01:21:21,630
bring your own know.
I'd have to think about it.

1543
01:21:21,900 --> 01:21:23,280
I'd have to think about
it in the same way.

1544
01:21:23,370 --> 01:21:26,940
That's interesting to me cause
that's, that's a different
thing. Well, not really,

1545
01:21:26,941 --> 01:21:29,640
because again, it's if you're
a religious person, and again,

1546
01:21:29,641 --> 01:21:32,550
take it from the religious perspective
that from the religious perspective,

1547
01:21:32,551 --> 01:21:33,384
the question is,

1548
01:21:33,660 --> 01:21:38,660
are you glorifying something that you
think is sinful substituted party for

1549
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:42,000
something that you think was originally
sinful? Can you participate in that?

1550
01:21:42,001 --> 01:21:44,880
So from a religious point of view, that's
an actual serious moral question. Yeah.

1551
01:21:45,660 --> 01:21:48,060
What I go out to dinner with
you, the answer is yes, right?

1552
01:21:48,061 --> 01:21:49,410
Because that's not actually like,

1553
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:52,350
let's celebrate something that I
feel that you're doing is sinful.

1554
01:21:52,650 --> 01:21:54,660
But I'd have to, I'd have to
think about that one. I'm,

1555
01:21:54,661 --> 01:21:58,590
and I'm being in a perfectly straight
forward as possible. I want you to see,

1556
01:21:58,591 --> 01:22:01,230
that's so interesting to me cause
it's like if I threw a regular party,

1557
01:22:01,231 --> 01:22:03,390
just we were just going to a party
at my house and all the guys that's

1558
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:05,400
[inaudible] like I bake you a cake,

1559
01:22:05,560 --> 01:22:08,340
but it had nothing to do with the gay
wedding and I would go to a party with you

1560
01:22:08,341 --> 01:22:10,710
that has nothing to do with gay men.
Would you make me a regular cake?

1561
01:22:10,711 --> 01:22:14,610
Could I just have a Thursday?
Sure I'd give you my baking sucks.

1562
01:22:14,611 --> 01:22:15,360
I'll just buy you one.

1563
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:18,830
I want you to Shepherd's gate like Shapiro
cake and then I'm going to write it.

1564
01:22:18,840 --> 01:22:22,020
Then once I get a piece of crap,
I mean, it's not gonna be good,

1565
01:22:22,021 --> 01:22:25,410
but it's that it'll be there. All right.
Let's see. There's a lot there were,

1566
01:22:25,420 --> 01:22:27,750
you know what, this is what we'll keep
talking about forever and it's all right.

1567
01:22:27,810 --> 01:22:32,280
Exactly. All right. Let's
see. Um, so Ben, huge fan.

1568
01:22:32,281 --> 01:22:35,310
Why do Asians overwhelmingly support the
left in spite of their cultural values

1569
01:22:35,311 --> 01:22:36,690
and how do we change this?
Also,

1570
01:22:36,691 --> 01:22:38,770
how are you explaining each of
your kids why it's wrong to lie?

1571
01:22:38,771 --> 01:22:43,620
Are you using religion or reason? Uh,
so the, uh, on the first question,

1572
01:22:43,940 --> 01:22:45,630
why do Asians overwhelmingly
support the left?

1573
01:22:45,630 --> 01:22:49,260
I think that there is a misperception
that is bolstered by a republican

1574
01:22:49,261 --> 01:22:52,710
inability to talk about issues of race,
which is that you have to overcome the,

1575
01:22:52,711 --> 01:22:54,870
the basic presumption that
Republicans are evil racists.

1576
01:22:55,020 --> 01:22:56,550
And once you get over that presumption,

1577
01:22:56,670 --> 01:22:59,370
then people tend to
vote more conservative,

1578
01:22:59,371 --> 01:23:02,390
but then his genes might vote for
their own economic interests. Right.

1579
01:23:02,890 --> 01:23:06,640
And for their own college
education interest. I mean,

1580
01:23:06,641 --> 01:23:09,340
it's the left that's trying to ban Asians
from higher education to places like

1581
01:23:09,341 --> 01:23:12,610
Harvard, but the right has a
reputation as being racist.

1582
01:23:12,611 --> 01:23:17,320
And it is not forwarded by intemperate
remarks from the president of the United

1583
01:23:17,320 --> 01:23:20,530
States on these sorts of issues.
And the right also, you know,

1584
01:23:20,650 --> 01:23:22,030
should be willing to ignorance.

1585
01:23:22,060 --> 01:23:24,910
I think that there's this
weird conversation about
race that goes something like

1586
01:23:24,911 --> 01:23:28,540
this. People on the left say there's been
historic racism in American society and

1587
01:23:28,541 --> 01:23:32,260
people in the right read that as what
you're saying is there's historic racism

1588
01:23:32,261 --> 01:23:34,780
in American society and that
means you want affirmative action.

1589
01:23:35,080 --> 01:23:37,210
And so people on the right goal,
I don't even want to talk about that.

1590
01:23:37,630 --> 01:23:38,381
And the people and let's say,
well,

1591
01:23:38,381 --> 01:23:40,030
you don't want to talk about
that because you're a racist.

1592
01:23:40,090 --> 01:23:41,860
Because what they read
the right saying is,

1593
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:44,470
I don't want to talk about it
at all because you're a racist.

1594
01:23:44,680 --> 01:23:47,680
When the conversation really should go
like this left as there's historic racism

1595
01:23:47,681 --> 01:23:50,980
in American society and go, right.
And then the, and the law says,

1596
01:23:50,981 --> 01:23:52,330
and now I want affirmative
action. You say, nope.

1597
01:23:52,990 --> 01:23:55,600
And then you have a conversation
about the actual policy.

1598
01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:58,390
But we conflate the questions because
we're all reading each other's minds.

1599
01:23:58,391 --> 01:23:59,350
And that's a dangerous game.
Well,

1600
01:23:59,351 --> 01:24:01,660
it's interesting because one of the
things that people say to me all the time

1601
01:24:01,661 --> 01:24:04,600
when I, when I do public speaking
events, talk to people after,

1602
01:24:04,601 --> 01:24:07,150
they will always say, you know, I was,
I, the huge amount of people say to me,

1603
01:24:07,151 --> 01:24:11,040
I was a lefty. I was just like you, I, I
s then evolved sort of the way you did.

1604
01:24:11,060 --> 01:24:13,600
And I can't tell you the amount of
friends that I have that now think I'm a

1605
01:24:13,601 --> 01:24:16,990
racist because I believe in
low taxes or blah blah blah.

1606
01:24:17,350 --> 01:24:22,350
And it's like the way they've been able
to conflate policy with racism is crazy

1607
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:25,870
because they think the
average lefty out there,

1608
01:24:26,550 --> 01:24:29,500
and I'm just doing something broad
for the purposes of a conversation,

1609
01:24:29,680 --> 01:24:31,570
thinks that if you say low taxes,

1610
01:24:31,571 --> 01:24:35,470
you mean you don't want to give money to
poor people. Now that is actually true,

1611
01:24:35,471 --> 01:24:37,240
but that doesn't mean it's racist.

1612
01:24:37,390 --> 01:24:40,930
You think that there are better ways to
help poor people than just taking money

1613
01:24:40,931 --> 01:24:43,630
from some and giving it to others.
So they've really,

1614
01:24:43,660 --> 01:24:46,390
there's an incredible trick
that they've pulled there.

1615
01:24:46,690 --> 01:24:51,430
That these are not racist. The amount
of conservative and Libertarian,

1616
01:24:51,550 --> 01:24:51,850
uh,

1617
01:24:51,850 --> 01:24:55,620
college things that I go to and all these
things and I never meet racist or I'm

1618
01:24:55,630 --> 01:24:58,060
meeting some pretty damn shady racist
because I can't figure out that they're

1619
01:24:58,061 --> 01:25:02,370
racist and they keep, they keep inviting
me. So, alright, let's see. Um, uh,

1620
01:25:02,380 --> 01:25:03,250
on that second question,

1621
01:25:03,251 --> 01:25:07,120
how am I explaining to my kids why it's
wrong to lie religion or reason? I mean,

1622
01:25:07,121 --> 01:25:08,440
the answer typically is both,
right?

1623
01:25:08,441 --> 01:25:12,070
You say that God doesn't want you to
lie because you are and, and Bait.

1624
01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:15,070
And why doesn't God want you to lie is
the reasonable question and the answers.

1625
01:25:15,071 --> 01:25:16,570
God doesn't want you
to lie because it is a,

1626
01:25:16,571 --> 01:25:19,900
is a fundamental disrespect of
another person as made in God's image.

1627
01:25:19,901 --> 01:25:22,690
I think that virtually all of Western
civilization is built on one verse in the

1628
01:25:22,691 --> 01:25:23,140
Bible,

1629
01:25:23,140 --> 01:25:26,440
that human beings are made in God's
image and from their springs in enormous

1630
01:25:26,441 --> 01:25:27,274
amounts of good.

1631
01:25:27,430 --> 01:25:30,040
There are things in religion that have
brought about an enormous amount of bad,

1632
01:25:30,041 --> 01:25:32,890
but that is one aspect of religion that
I don't think you can get to simply

1633
01:25:32,891 --> 01:25:37,180
through scientific materialism. But this
is a Sam Harris. We've had, this is,

1634
01:25:37,230 --> 01:25:39,450
this is the Sam you,
Sam Jordan wanted,

1635
01:25:39,750 --> 01:25:43,480
that's what it all whittles down to
that can science and reason in your own

1636
01:25:43,481 --> 01:25:45,820
consciousness to get you there at a,
at a human.

1637
01:25:45,821 --> 01:25:47,860
Speaking of which was a patron
of question four, it says, Dave,

1638
01:25:47,861 --> 01:25:51,790
did you find out what they, what the
dark enlightenment is? The, Oh, you know,

1639
01:25:51,791 --> 01:25:55,140
someone asked me about the
dark enlightenment once
on a Patrion feed and I,

1640
01:25:55,400 --> 01:25:58,120
I think maybe somebody sent me
some info. I honestly, I think,

1641
01:25:58,121 --> 01:25:59,830
I think basically the idea of
the dark enlightenment for,

1642
01:25:59,831 --> 01:26:03,530
for those who are sort of
unaware, is that what, what

1643
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:05,090
you know,
um,

1644
01:26:05,270 --> 01:26:07,820
pinker will do is he'll basically say
all the good stuff that I liked from the

1645
01:26:07,821 --> 01:26:08,360
enlightenment,

1646
01:26:08,360 --> 01:26:11,000
the enlightenment and everything else
is the counter alignment and dark and

1647
01:26:11,001 --> 01:26:13,370
light man is basically, well, no Roussel
was part of the enlightenment to,

1648
01:26:13,371 --> 01:26:15,190
he just happened to suck.
And so that's it.

1649
01:26:15,191 --> 01:26:18,530
And so trying to look at the downsides
and the upsides of the enlightenment is

1650
01:26:18,531 --> 01:26:19,364
actually a worthwhile.

1651
01:26:19,390 --> 01:26:22,240
So this is sorta like, I
remember right before I left, um,

1652
01:26:22,241 --> 01:26:25,750
there were a couple people like really
attacking the enlightenment as this

1653
01:26:25,751 --> 01:26:27,910
racist movement.
So this is sort of that,

1654
01:26:28,780 --> 01:26:30,610
that, but also like the, there's a,

1655
01:26:30,611 --> 01:26:32,770
there's a perspective on the
enlightenment that basically says that the

1656
01:26:32,771 --> 01:26:35,800
enlightenments move toward
individual values and away from was,

1657
01:26:35,830 --> 01:26:37,810
was simultaneously a
move away from virtue.

1658
01:26:37,990 --> 01:26:40,870
So if you look at sort of
more ancient philosophy,

1659
01:26:40,871 --> 01:26:44,740
ancient philosophy says that your goal
as a human being is to act in accordance

1660
01:26:44,741 --> 01:26:49,480
with natural law, natural law being the
things that [inaudible] reason dictates.

1661
01:26:49,481 --> 01:26:52,890
Essentially. This is sort
of the Aristotelian, yeah,
natural law argument. I,

1662
01:26:52,950 --> 01:26:55,690
and then in the, in the sort of
modern period people say, well,

1663
01:26:55,691 --> 01:26:57,970
but everybody has a different
idea of what's good for them.

1664
01:26:58,240 --> 01:27:02,290
So this libertarian idea and so what
we need is limited institutions so that

1665
01:27:02,291 --> 01:27:04,300
people can do whatever they want.

1666
01:27:04,490 --> 01:27:07,660
And so the idea of the dark enlightenment
basically is that if you take that

1667
01:27:07,661 --> 01:27:11,350
libertarian ideal to its extreme where
there is no social fabric that combines

1668
01:27:11,351 --> 01:27:14,620
us anymore than you either end up with
sort of this atomism where everybody is

1669
01:27:14,680 --> 01:27:16,910
on their own.
There's no shared sense of,

1670
01:27:16,911 --> 01:27:20,200
of belonging and those who knows your
sense of values. And on the other hand,

1671
01:27:20,290 --> 01:27:21,250
if you believe that reason,

1672
01:27:21,251 --> 01:27:24,520
rules everything but that individual
human beings don't mean anything,

1673
01:27:24,610 --> 01:27:26,020
then marks is a part
of this enlightenment.

1674
01:27:26,021 --> 01:27:27,490
Ideal to our reason is the head and we,

1675
01:27:27,491 --> 01:27:30,610
all we have to do is reorganize society
along the lines that we see fit and we

1676
01:27:30,611 --> 01:27:31,680
can create a better man.

1677
01:27:31,850 --> 01:27:34,980
Right. So I mean the other side of the
enlightenment, right. I got it. So,

1678
01:27:35,040 --> 01:27:39,090
so you know that I obviously I mostly
believe in that libertarian idea

1679
01:27:39,320 --> 01:27:43,410
[inaudible] right.
So I believe in it within the prism of,

1680
01:27:43,770 --> 01:27:48,600
I think that's how human flourishing
and human freedom we'll expand the most.

1681
01:27:48,630 --> 01:27:49,200
Not,

1682
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:53,610
I believe you have to be left basically
to your own ideas but I don't want to

1683
01:27:53,611 --> 01:27:57,030
live in Mad Max at the same time. And
I understand, right? This is where

1684
01:27:57,260 --> 01:27:58,880
this is restricting in critique,
right?

1685
01:27:58,890 --> 01:28:01,910
Patrick Deneen has a book
called why liberalism failed
and his basic critique is

1686
01:28:01,911 --> 01:28:06,200
that we aired too much on the side of
liberty without in a focus on the social

1687
01:28:06,201 --> 01:28:09,390
fabric that if you don't focus on the
social fabric, you don't focus on virtue.

1688
01:28:09,391 --> 01:28:10,490
You only focus on,
right.

1689
01:28:10,640 --> 01:28:12,770
While you end up with is a bunch of
people who are non virtuous who think

1690
01:28:12,771 --> 01:28:13,604
everything.
Is that right?

1691
01:28:13,610 --> 01:28:14,890
You know, it's funny. I mean, you know,

1692
01:28:14,891 --> 01:28:17,800
my thoughts on most of these political
issues and we just spent the last hour

1693
01:28:17,800 --> 01:28:20,350
and a half talking a lot about virtue
and a lot about the social fabric.

1694
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:24,040
So whatever that is there for it,
that's where, that's where I'm at.

1695
01:28:24,070 --> 01:28:27,430
Okay. Here's a patriotic
question. Uh, let's see.

1696
01:28:27,610 --> 01:28:30,520
Uh hmm. Okay. What,

1697
01:28:30,521 --> 01:28:34,240
if any success could president Trump have
where the media would give him credit

1698
01:28:34,510 --> 01:28:36,460
without a backhand
dilution or anything else?

1699
01:28:36,461 --> 01:28:37,870
Do you think there's anything
Trump could do with the media?

1700
01:28:37,871 --> 01:28:38,500
Would give him credit?

1701
01:28:38,500 --> 01:28:42,020
Not really. I mean, they've
painted it. Look, they've
painted him as Hitler. I mean,

1702
01:28:42,021 --> 01:28:45,490
I, the first video that I did
the day after the election,
sitting in my backyard,

1703
01:28:45,880 --> 01:28:47,590
I said, you know, the risk here is that,

1704
01:28:47,591 --> 01:28:49,090
and I was even saying
this before the election,

1705
01:28:49,091 --> 01:28:50,680
if you keep calling someone Hitler,

1706
01:28:51,130 --> 01:28:56,130
you can never acknowledged when anything
is good and that that will keep pushing

1707
01:28:56,231 --> 01:28:59,740
you further one way and potentially
pushing the other person the other way.

1708
01:28:59,741 --> 01:29:02,850
Or at least the supporters that
you, because you can't be like, oh,

1709
01:29:02,851 --> 01:29:05,490
well the economy's doing well, good
for Hitler. You know what I mean?

1710
01:29:05,520 --> 01:29:09,550
Like everything that you do that's
good is actually worse for you. Right.

1711
01:29:09,551 --> 01:29:14,370
Actually evil. And this is also where you
get this sort of a guy who I, you know,

1712
01:29:14,371 --> 01:29:16,830
I agreed with for most of my life
why now have some disagreements with,

1713
01:29:16,831 --> 01:29:19,080
but I had nothing but respect
for Bill Maher. You know,

1714
01:29:19,081 --> 01:29:20,670
a couple of months ago when
he was talking, you know,

1715
01:29:20,671 --> 01:29:23,610
cause he has real Trump
derangement syndrome and he
was saying this thing about

1716
01:29:23,910 --> 01:29:28,470
how if we, if the economy has to fail to
get rid of this guy, that's what we need.

1717
01:29:28,770 --> 01:29:29,603
And it's like,
yeah,

1718
01:29:29,610 --> 01:29:32,460
that's easy to say when you probably
have a hundred million bucks and I'm not,

1719
01:29:32,850 --> 01:29:36,030
I love Bill Maher and I hope he'll sit
in this seat one day and I'll be there.

1720
01:29:36,031 --> 01:29:40,590
And you know, yeah, but you
were on a show not too long ago,

1721
01:29:42,320 --> 01:29:47,280
but, but I don't want to be in a position
where you root for the failure of the

1722
01:29:47,281 --> 01:29:51,870
country because you want the failure
of this one man. If he, if he failed,

1723
01:29:51,871 --> 01:29:55,740
you know, Sam did a piece right after
the election. As much as Sam hates Trump,

1724
01:29:55,741 --> 01:29:57,300
he said, look, now he's
the pilot of the plane,

1725
01:29:57,301 --> 01:30:00,110
so if you want the plane to crash
while you're on it, so that, that,

1726
01:30:00,111 --> 01:30:01,320
that ain't great.
Right.

1727
01:30:01,350 --> 01:30:04,380
So I would say there's probably nothing
that they would really ever give him

1728
01:30:04,381 --> 01:30:05,100
credit for.

1729
01:30:05,100 --> 01:30:08,370
But I think at the same time what they
create is most people in this country two

1730
01:30:08,371 --> 01:30:12,960
years into a Trump presidency,
if you remove the tweets and the Co,

1731
01:30:12,990 --> 01:30:16,890
like if you remove, just like the generic
sort of screaming thing all the time.

1732
01:30:16,891 --> 01:30:20,130
Yeah. Well what actually is happening,
the economy is still pretty good.

1733
01:30:20,131 --> 01:30:23,190
Like we're not, does anyone think Trump's
going to start in nation building?

1734
01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:25,530
I actually think some of
our alliances are stronger.

1735
01:30:25,531 --> 01:30:26,820
Even everyone else says they're weaker.

1736
01:30:26,850 --> 01:30:29,690
I think some of the trade stuff
actually could start working our,

1737
01:30:29,710 --> 01:30:33,090
in our advantage. I don't,
I don't know exactly,

1738
01:30:33,091 --> 01:30:35,430
but I don't think there's anything
that they could really, you can't,

1739
01:30:35,550 --> 01:30:38,130
I mean I think you probably mostly agree
with that. I definitely agree with that.

1740
01:30:38,130 --> 01:30:40,350
Okay. So I won't, I won't ask you this
one cause I think that's a good question.

1741
01:30:40,360 --> 01:30:43,440
Is from your a super chat. Yeah. So
talk about the art and the studio.

1742
01:30:43,441 --> 01:30:48,240
What's the new art? Oh, I'm glad that
came up. So a, a spectacular artist,

1743
01:30:48,241 --> 01:30:51,130
her name is right there.
Uh, Kaitlyn rose, Janet, uh,

1744
01:30:51,210 --> 01:30:53,130
painted this painting that's behind you.

1745
01:30:53,370 --> 01:30:56,100
And then the painting that's behind
me is sort of inspired from that.

1746
01:30:56,101 --> 01:30:58,890
And one of the things that she did,
she knows how much I love coffee.

1747
01:30:58,891 --> 01:31:01,950
So you can see sort of the
texture, the texture, right. Minor.

1748
01:31:01,951 --> 01:31:05,130
That's actual coffee grinds
that are in there. Um,

1749
01:31:05,131 --> 01:31:09,870
I think her website is Kaitlyn
rose, c a y l I n rows, janet.com.

1750
01:31:10,060 --> 01:31:13,770
And she's done like, there's tons of
artwork in my house that, that she's done.

1751
01:31:13,771 --> 01:31:17,010
We have this huge millennium park claim.
What coffee do you like?

1752
01:31:17,011 --> 01:31:19,490
What's your call? Do you have
a coffee? Well, I have a,

1753
01:31:19,491 --> 01:31:23,480
I do French press and I grinded in the
morning and the whole thing. Yeah. What,

1754
01:31:23,481 --> 01:31:28,310
what do you do? Yeah. I mean I
haven't expressed it, but that's,

1755
01:31:28,340 --> 01:31:30,510
that's really fair to guess. I don't
find this press with that. I could see,

1756
01:31:30,810 --> 01:31:32,880
I could see you drinking
Keurig cause you will.

1757
01:31:33,550 --> 01:31:35,820
Cause you're saying you wouldn't
put the effort into that.

1758
01:31:36,790 --> 01:31:39,540
I didn't drink coffee until
like a month ago. Oh wait,

1759
01:31:39,541 --> 01:31:42,710
you've been talking this fast for all
these years without a goat cheese and I

1760
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:46,110
was getting no sleep one week and I had
coffee in my show is marketing and I was

1761
01:31:46,111 --> 01:31:50,350
like, okay, well then I guess I have to
check myself to cocaine. This is possible.

1762
01:31:50,870 --> 01:31:55,500
And I were, even though you won't make me
a cake, I will brew you a cup of coffee.

1763
01:31:55,501 --> 01:31:59,140
I appreciate it. Thank you man.
That's all I'm asking from you. Also,

1764
01:31:59,141 --> 01:31:59,974
leave me alone if I don't want

1765
01:32:00,210 --> 01:32:03,850
are two things. By the way,
I equate quick note on that.

1766
01:32:03,851 --> 01:32:05,800
I would also mention that like in Judaism,

1767
01:32:05,801 --> 01:32:08,440
it's not just like gay marriage
that's off limits. It's intermarriage.

1768
01:32:08,441 --> 01:32:09,021
That's off limit.

1769
01:32:09,021 --> 01:32:12,070
So if a member of my family were to
intermarry like marry somebody who's not

1770
01:32:12,071 --> 01:32:14,350
Jewish, I wouldn't go to the
wedding. Realize it. Yeah. All right.

1771
01:32:14,470 --> 01:32:16,190
This is like an issue.
So even if that we,

1772
01:32:16,191 --> 01:32:18,340
let's say it was your sister for example.
Um,

1773
01:32:18,580 --> 01:32:20,680
even though I know she just got married
and I met the guy who does that, right.

1774
01:32:20,740 --> 01:32:24,730
Nice guy. Um, even if that would do
irreparable damage with your sister.

1775
01:32:24,790 --> 01:32:26,900
Well, you're the in, in,
in know my view, the,

1776
01:32:26,901 --> 01:32:30,250
the irreparable damage is being done by
the fact that like if you're brought up

1777
01:32:30,251 --> 01:32:31,084
in a certain,

1778
01:32:31,300 --> 01:32:34,480
with a certain sense of values and rules
and then you abandon those values and

1779
01:32:34,481 --> 01:32:38,400
rules, then uh, you know, that's, that's
an irreverent, it's so interesting, right?

1780
01:32:38,480 --> 01:32:40,220
I,
I really intellectually,

1781
01:32:40,221 --> 01:32:44,120
I really kind of understand that and I
think that we are living in a society

1782
01:32:44,121 --> 01:32:47,020
that's because of the loss
of what clarity is where we,

1783
01:32:47,060 --> 01:32:49,160
that's part of why the
fraying is happening.

1784
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:52,940
But it's like when we went out to dinner
that IDW night and we were at that

1785
01:32:52,941 --> 01:32:57,890
steak house and we all had these, Joe
got this like, you know, giant Tomahawk.

1786
01:32:57,891 --> 01:32:59,900
That was for two people.
He hated himself of course.

1787
01:33:00,150 --> 01:33:03,280
And Jordan had like the biggest
steak I've ever seen and uh,

1788
01:33:03,410 --> 01:33:07,910
Eric and I split this porter house and
it was so freaking delicious and you

1789
01:33:07,911 --> 01:33:10,100
brought your dinner right cause you're
kosher so you're obviously not gonna be

1790
01:33:10,101 --> 01:33:11,660
there and you wouldn't even need
on their plates and all that.

1791
01:33:12,170 --> 01:33:16,730
And I respect you making that decision
for yourself. I, I, I truly do.

1792
01:33:16,760 --> 01:33:19,000
I truly do. And I have family
members who are closer. Yeah.

1793
01:33:19,620 --> 01:33:21,000
As a religious person. Yeah. There is a,

1794
01:33:21,001 --> 01:33:25,110
there is a constant conflict between
your role as a religious person and what

1795
01:33:25,111 --> 01:33:26,220
you may feel in your heart.
Right.

1796
01:33:26,221 --> 01:33:28,980
So the fact is that I want
to keep by everywhere. Yeah.

1797
01:33:29,210 --> 01:33:32,700
There are certain rules about like
when I'm supposed to wear a Yamaka,

1798
01:33:32,701 --> 01:33:36,600
like if I walk into a place and I'm not
obviously carrying my own lunch. Yeah.

1799
01:33:36,630 --> 01:33:39,840
It's actually a problem because people
might think the restaurant is kosher for

1800
01:33:39,841 --> 01:33:40,351
example now.

1801
01:33:40,351 --> 01:33:42,650
And then they're going to eat there
because they saw this famous orthodox Jews

1802
01:33:42,690 --> 01:33:44,130
walking into a non kosher restaurant.

1803
01:33:44,340 --> 01:33:47,220
So that's something that you have to take
into account is that how much are you

1804
01:33:47,221 --> 01:33:50,670
conveying that your religion approves of
a particular activity when you actually

1805
01:33:50,671 --> 01:33:54,810
engage in the particular activity and
that that applies to a wide variety of

1806
01:33:54,811 --> 01:33:55,260
them.

1807
01:33:55,260 --> 01:33:57,750
It's so interesting to me though
because when I came home that night,

1808
01:33:57,751 --> 01:34:00,920
I swear you can ask David after I
was like, I was sitting there and I,

1809
01:34:00,970 --> 01:34:05,280
I can Ben Bright, I think he brought a
burger. You're eating your burger and I'm,

1810
01:34:05,400 --> 01:34:09,390
I know how delicious this steak is.
And it's like, I really was like,

1811
01:34:09,450 --> 01:34:13,800
why would Ben deny
himself just this truly,

1812
01:34:13,801 --> 01:34:18,530
truly smell delicious delicious thing
book. But you do. And that it doesn't

1813
01:34:18,910 --> 01:34:21,640
because it's talking about holistic
lifestyle in which you make choices about

1814
01:34:21,641 --> 01:34:23,140
what you want to participate
in and what you don't,

1815
01:34:23,141 --> 01:34:26,200
but that doesn't change even necessarily
how you feel about the people who are

1816
01:34:26,201 --> 01:34:28,480
engaged in particular
activities is just saying like,

1817
01:34:28,510 --> 01:34:32,650
I as a religious person cannot
stamp within premature like that.

1818
01:34:32,651 --> 01:34:34,270
This is okay with me
as a religious person.

1819
01:34:34,271 --> 01:34:36,580
But that doesn't mean that I care
about you any less. For example,

1820
01:34:36,581 --> 01:34:38,290
or I would care about my sister any less.
Right.

1821
01:34:38,291 --> 01:34:39,580
If she did something that I didn't like

1822
01:34:39,620 --> 01:34:42,620
just in terms of importance. Uh,
I'm going to move the stake away.

1823
01:34:42,621 --> 01:34:44,510
I'm not going to force you to say I still,

1824
01:34:44,720 --> 01:34:48,350
I think I'll be able to get you to smoke
a joint at some point and I definitely

1825
01:34:48,351 --> 01:34:50,290
am going to be able to get
you say fuck on camera though.

1826
01:34:51,500 --> 01:34:56,310
I like your posts. Your so called the
last one is actually not that far a leap.

1827
01:34:56,340 --> 01:34:58,010
If, if I, I had a blue version of my

1828
01:34:58,010 --> 01:35:03,010
show we'd be on believable of my
show would be on Real Shapiro.

1829
01:35:03,921 --> 01:35:06,950
Perhaps some of the people we've been
talking to have some ideas for some new

1830
01:35:06,951 --> 01:35:10,160
shows and maybe there was something
already in the world would be pretty wild.

1831
01:35:10,230 --> 01:35:14,690
Yeah. Okay, so a couple of
more here. Let's see. Um, okay,

1832
01:35:14,691 --> 01:35:18,200
this is, this is a good
one. Super Chat question.

1833
01:35:19,280 --> 01:35:23,950
I'm sorry. I want to find all
the best ones here for it.

1834
01:35:24,140 --> 01:35:27,730
We're doing it live. Yeah, exactly.
I'm trying to read these. Okay,

1835
01:35:27,740 --> 01:35:29,260
so the ancient Greek proverb,
if you go to work,

1836
01:35:29,261 --> 01:35:31,010
you better finish it or you'll
leave it to your grandchildren,

1837
01:35:31,070 --> 01:35:32,630
which I don't think he's
actually from the ancient Greek.

1838
01:35:32,950 --> 01:35:36,620
You think we didn't finish the war of
ideas against Marxism in the Cold War,

1839
01:35:36,770 --> 01:35:39,530
and that is why we have a rise of
Marxism on college campuses today.

1840
01:35:39,920 --> 01:35:43,910
I'll let you feel their first.
I think that my basic answer would be yes,

1841
01:35:43,911 --> 01:35:47,030
we sort of let this stuff fester
as if it was the cool stuff,

1842
01:35:47,270 --> 01:35:50,330
but I don't know what the
completion of a war of ideas is.

1843
01:35:50,331 --> 01:35:53,300
Like you stamp things out to the
point that no one can speak of them.

1844
01:35:53,301 --> 01:35:56,990
That's not what we want. So, so it's
almost an unanswerable question.

1845
01:35:57,530 --> 01:35:59,510
I think Jonah Goldberg's answer
on this is basically correct,

1846
01:35:59,511 --> 01:36:02,360
which is that there's a human tendency
to buck against freedom and that human

1847
01:36:02,361 --> 01:36:04,550
tendency is why can't we
control the world around us?

1848
01:36:04,551 --> 01:36:06,560
Why can't we get together and
solve all of our problems?

1849
01:36:06,770 --> 01:36:10,430
Why is it that what free markets
are counterintuitive? The idea,

1850
01:36:10,431 --> 01:36:12,170
if you leave everybody alone,
your life is going to be better,

1851
01:36:12,620 --> 01:36:13,820
is really good for intuitive.

1852
01:36:13,821 --> 01:36:16,460
Usually the idea is if I can
control everybody around me,

1853
01:36:16,610 --> 01:36:18,950
then my life will be better cause I can
get them to do all the things I want

1854
01:36:18,951 --> 01:36:21,020
them to do. I don't want
to control anybody, right?

1855
01:36:21,050 --> 01:36:23,830
But I want my little piece of the Pie
and I'm going to do good work here.

1856
01:36:24,080 --> 01:36:28,970
But that's it. But that's it. That's
a cultivated idea most as a child,

1857
01:36:28,971 --> 01:36:30,290
right?
Or like when I look at my children,

1858
01:36:30,291 --> 01:36:34,040
my children want to control everything
around them, right? Including me and what,

1859
01:36:34,100 --> 01:36:36,350
and if you believe that
if we all get together,

1860
01:36:36,351 --> 01:36:39,200
we can build this giant edifice together.
Why can't you just get on board?

1861
01:36:39,201 --> 01:36:43,130
Just get onboard. Then Marxism has
a certain kind of particular draw.

1862
01:36:43,250 --> 01:36:45,530
Especially when you look at the fact
that they're rich people that are poor

1863
01:36:45,531 --> 01:36:47,720
people. When you say
to people, well, right,

1864
01:36:47,780 --> 01:36:49,310
they're going to be some rich
people in some poor people,

1865
01:36:49,311 --> 01:36:50,450
but overall we're getting richer.

1866
01:36:50,630 --> 01:36:52,850
That is more counterintuitive than
why can I just steal that guy's money?

1867
01:36:52,851 --> 01:36:54,290
Put it in my pocket and I'm better off.

1868
01:36:54,530 --> 01:36:57,680
And so I don't think that Marxism can
never be fully stamped out. That said,

1869
01:36:57,890 --> 01:37:01,340
I think the conservative movement has
failed markedly to make good arguments

1870
01:37:01,341 --> 01:37:05,180
against Marxism and they've basically
made arguments on the basis of efficacy

1871
01:37:05,181 --> 01:37:08,630
rather than morality. They've said
basically Marxism, it's moral idea,

1872
01:37:08,750 --> 01:37:12,470
it just is bad and administration. And
I think Marxism is deeply immoral idea.

1873
01:37:12,471 --> 01:37:13,810
That's also terrible in administration.

1874
01:37:13,850 --> 01:37:18,050
So do you think that's also why guys
like like me and you get so much hate

1875
01:37:18,290 --> 01:37:22,040
because someone like me,
I'm, I was once something,

1876
01:37:22,041 --> 01:37:26,030
I had a certain set of ideas I've shown
you can escape and survive and now there

1877
01:37:26,031 --> 01:37:29,030
clearly is a massive movement behind that.
I mean I know it,

1878
01:37:29,180 --> 01:37:32,930
I know it is real or the amount of young
people that are waking up and are going

1879
01:37:32,931 --> 01:37:36,020
this thing that they're going to sh
jammed down your throat in college and in

1880
01:37:36,021 --> 01:37:39,440
high school is not good. It
is not real. It is not true.

1881
01:37:39,560 --> 01:37:42,590
And there aren't many examples of people
escaping. There was David Horowitz,

1882
01:37:42,591 --> 01:37:46,220
you know, 30 years ago or whatever,
but there's not very modern examples.

1883
01:37:46,221 --> 01:37:49,460
So that's why for the, for the, it's
not like I put out a lot of hate,

1884
01:37:49,461 --> 01:37:51,380
but I seem to get a lot of online hate.

1885
01:37:51,500 --> 01:37:54,120
And I think that's the reason
that I think partly for you it's,

1886
01:37:54,170 --> 01:37:56,130
it's similar to a different degree.
You

1887
01:37:56,130 --> 01:38:01,080
get it because you're willing to talk
to people like me and Sam and whoever

1888
01:38:01,081 --> 01:38:01,500
else.

1889
01:38:01,500 --> 01:38:05,490
So they're going the real hardcore people
that hate all that stuff don't want

1890
01:38:05,491 --> 01:38:07,020
you to do it,
even though they love you,

1891
01:38:07,140 --> 01:38:09,050
but they don't want you to do it
because they think that might be okay.

1892
01:38:09,060 --> 01:38:11,130
A little awkward. Gelati
exactly. Yeah, exactly. Okay.

1893
01:38:11,131 --> 01:38:14,820
So somebody wants you to do
a Trump impersonation for
the memes. Very important.

1894
01:38:14,870 --> 01:38:17,360
Oh. Um, what is it

1895
01:38:17,410 --> 01:38:22,410
do I do? I'm so as lady dies paper, I
don't even know what he does anymore.

1896
01:38:22,411 --> 01:38:24,930
You're fired. I Dunno. It's like, no,

1897
01:38:25,020 --> 01:38:27,510
I got to work on that stuff. Yeah.
Yeah. They, did you have any,

1898
01:38:27,511 --> 01:38:29,280
do you do any good impersonations?
You don't get good impression?

1899
01:38:29,360 --> 01:38:33,830
Uh, not I, you know what,
I'll come back with some DC.

1900
01:38:33,860 --> 01:38:36,420
I used to do a great Cosby impression,
but then he became the greatest

1901
01:38:36,460 --> 01:38:41,010
Syria naked. Naked. Do you'll sleep wake
of the Trump glut cake. Will the children

1902
01:38:44,210 --> 01:38:47,170
okay. Close enough. Close enough. There's,
there's only so much we can do here. Uh,

1903
01:38:47,190 --> 01:38:49,650
it says we put [inaudible] him

1904
01:38:52,540 --> 01:38:54,180
is going to go south so fast.

1905
01:38:54,660 --> 01:38:56,370
Hi Ben. In Dave, can you
define what rights are?

1906
01:38:56,371 --> 01:38:58,980
I think there's a disconnect between the
left and the right on what rights are.

1907
01:39:00,460 --> 01:39:02,710
Well, I believe you
are, you are born free.

1908
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:05,920
You have the right to end in this country.
You have the right to life,

1909
01:39:05,921 --> 01:39:07,480
liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

1910
01:39:07,481 --> 01:39:10,150
And then the bill of rights lays
out what your other rights are.

1911
01:39:10,390 --> 01:39:13,780
The government has to protect those
rights. It did not give you those rights.

1912
01:39:13,781 --> 01:39:15,400
And I think that's the
most important thing.

1913
01:39:15,670 --> 01:39:17,650
The government did not give me my freedom.

1914
01:39:17,651 --> 01:39:20,530
The government can take away my freedom,
but he did not give it to me.

1915
01:39:20,740 --> 01:39:24,160
So we have rights that are very
clearly laid out. And again,

1916
01:39:24,161 --> 01:39:26,530
this is why I don't want big government,

1917
01:39:26,740 --> 01:39:30,010
big government in every way
will trample on those rights.

1918
01:39:30,190 --> 01:39:34,420
We've a beautiful system of rights,
free speech, the right to bear arms,

1919
01:39:34,421 --> 01:39:38,020
the right to privacy, all of those things.
These are incredibly powerful things,

1920
01:39:38,021 --> 01:39:40,870
but it's not because the right,
the government gave those rights to us.

1921
01:39:41,050 --> 01:39:42,640
It's protecting what I think.

1922
01:39:42,850 --> 01:39:45,250
So I know this is where conservatives
usually would say these are God given

1923
01:39:45,251 --> 01:39:47,230
rights.
I think you can just say they're there.

1924
01:39:47,290 --> 01:39:51,430
They're huge innately human rights
that you, you are as a human being.

1925
01:39:51,460 --> 01:39:54,220
It is your birthright.
You are born free.

1926
01:39:54,370 --> 01:39:57,940
Can someone grab you right out of the uh,
out of the womb and put you in jail?

1927
01:39:57,941 --> 01:40:01,270
Yes. But you were born
free. I think that's how I,

1928
01:40:01,330 --> 01:40:03,260
you said this,
the basic Locky and argument for,

1929
01:40:03,261 --> 01:40:07,210
for the philosophers in the room is that
basically you are born with particular

1930
01:40:07,211 --> 01:40:11,230
rights and these rights adhere to you
by virtue of you not having to get

1931
01:40:11,231 --> 01:40:12,130
something from someone else.

1932
01:40:12,280 --> 01:40:15,790
So you have a right to speak free because
that's not an imposition on anybody

1933
01:40:15,791 --> 01:40:16,360
else.
Right.

1934
01:40:16,360 --> 01:40:19,360
And negative rate versus a positive rate
as the typical language that is used.

1935
01:40:19,570 --> 01:40:20,800
Conservatives believe in negative rights.

1936
01:40:20,801 --> 01:40:22,180
People on the left believe
in positive rights.

1937
01:40:22,181 --> 01:40:25,420
This would be like the right to education
where you can take to the sky that you

1938
01:40:25,421 --> 01:40:27,880
have right to education. But unless you're
actually forcing a teacher to teach,

1939
01:40:28,030 --> 01:40:30,640
right, then there's no right, right.
The same thing, right to housing,

1940
01:40:30,641 --> 01:40:32,870
right to healthcare.
The left is very big into the clarion.

1941
01:40:33,480 --> 01:40:34,850
Good.
I believe you were right though.

1942
01:40:35,130 --> 01:40:37,400
Now we got him started on the impressions
and it's not going to stop it. Yes,

1943
01:40:37,510 --> 01:40:38,380
that's right.
So the,

1944
01:40:38,620 --> 01:40:42,220
so the idea there is that in a state
of nature where no one else is around,

1945
01:40:42,221 --> 01:40:45,460
you have these particular rights.
You have the right to make it to,

1946
01:40:45,461 --> 01:40:48,250
to gotten labor. You have the
right to, to control your labor.

1947
01:40:48,251 --> 01:40:49,450
You have the right to speak freely,

1948
01:40:49,451 --> 01:40:51,490
have the right to free assembly
to worship God how you want.

1949
01:40:51,700 --> 01:40:53,920
You have the right to do all of these
things because you're not imposing on

1950
01:40:53,921 --> 01:40:55,750
anybody else in the minute that
you're imposing on anybody else.

1951
01:40:55,751 --> 01:40:58,690
It's no longer right. So the baking
cake example is actually a good one.

1952
01:40:58,691 --> 01:41:01,240
There are folks on the left who say you
have a right to go into somebody's shop

1953
01:41:01,310 --> 01:41:02,440
in demanded service from them.

1954
01:41:02,530 --> 01:41:05,350
The answer is you don't have a right
to go into somebody's shop and Amanda

1955
01:41:05,350 --> 01:41:07,480
Service from them. Maybe you'd
prefer if they give you that service.

1956
01:41:07,481 --> 01:41:08,920
Maybe it's smarter if they
give you that service.

1957
01:41:08,921 --> 01:41:10,480
Maybe it's more moral if
they give you that service,

1958
01:41:10,630 --> 01:41:14,170
but you don't have the right to
go and demand service from anyone,

1959
01:41:14,260 --> 01:41:18,280
from anyone else because rights are
things that I am not demanding from you.

1960
01:41:18,420 --> 01:41:21,550
Then flip side of that is duties,
which is because you have a right to life.

1961
01:41:21,551 --> 01:41:23,410
I have a,
I have a duty not to kill you,

1962
01:41:23,620 --> 01:41:26,620
but I would have that duty not to kill
you regardless of whatever you call that.

1963
01:41:26,621 --> 01:41:28,750
Right. Okay, so while you were gone,

1964
01:41:28,751 --> 01:41:31,900
apparently there are a bunch of people
who have been asking about whether you

1965
01:41:31,901 --> 01:41:35,250
are indeed funded by then a ferry is
evil, terrible Koch brothers. Oh Lord.

1966
01:41:35,251 --> 01:41:38,500
So let's give you the opportunity to
answer why you were in the pay of the

1967
01:41:38,501 --> 01:41:39,570
shekel masters. Right. All right.

1968
01:41:39,590 --> 01:41:42,770
First off, well, if anyone
wants to know if this thing
is, I did it or not, I think,

1969
01:41:42,771 --> 01:41:44,480
there you go. Okay. I'm
glad you asked actually.

1970
01:41:44,481 --> 01:41:47,030
Cause this is just endless
dribble that is, you know,

1971
01:41:47,180 --> 01:41:50,360
this is partly one of the things
about just online nonsense.

1972
01:41:50,390 --> 01:41:54,800
It's like you could spend
all day defending yourself
about untrue claims and the

1973
01:41:54,801 --> 01:41:58,790
attacks that we get in personally attacks
and a trike often [inaudible] Sam,

1974
01:41:58,820 --> 01:42:00,770
when I had him on last
time a couple months ago,

1975
01:42:00,980 --> 01:42:03,230
he said for the two years that
he was under endless assault,

1976
01:42:03,231 --> 01:42:08,090
he almost views all his defense as wasted
time because often, nope. The truth,

1977
01:42:08,120 --> 01:42:12,200
the truth will set you
free. It'll, it'll, um,

1978
01:42:12,230 --> 01:42:16,190
it's the right thing, the
truth. But often if you're,

1979
01:42:16,220 --> 01:42:19,910
if you're debating against
or your protagonists are
attackers don't care about

1980
01:42:19,911 --> 01:42:23,090
truth, then you're just feeding
them by giving them anything.

1981
01:42:23,091 --> 01:42:26,360
You're just feeding more insanity,
which is why I haven't, I think I've,

1982
01:42:26,840 --> 01:42:29,810
maybe I've even addressed this public. I'm
not even sure. Okay. So here's the deal.

1983
01:42:29,930 --> 01:42:32,900
And I'd been completely transparent about
this the entire time. It's so stupid.

1984
01:42:33,170 --> 01:42:36,440
So learn liberty, which is they
produce one show of ours a month.

1985
01:42:36,441 --> 01:42:40,520
They've given us incredible professors
like Deirdre mccloskey and Randy Barnett

1986
01:42:40,670 --> 01:42:43,340
and Steve Davies and Shawn
Hopwood and people from all.

1987
01:42:43,341 --> 01:42:45,710
And Fatty is Russell people
from all over the political map.

1988
01:42:46,130 --> 01:42:48,920
They produced one show a month.
They give us a list of professors.

1989
01:42:49,160 --> 01:42:52,220
I can pick any of them and if I don't
like any of them I can pick anyone else.

1990
01:42:52,310 --> 01:42:54,140
They've given us people
all over the political map.

1991
01:42:54,350 --> 01:42:56,930
They sponsored our episode with
Phil to Franco, the youtuber.

1992
01:42:56,960 --> 01:43:00,440
They had never even met him or had any
interaction with him. They just liked him.

1993
01:43:00,441 --> 01:43:02,330
So I said,
learn liberty at the top.

1994
01:43:02,331 --> 01:43:04,760
This episode is brought to you by learn
liberty or our friends that you learn

1995
01:43:04,761 --> 01:43:06,440
liberty or whatever.
And then they donated,

1996
01:43:06,441 --> 01:43:08,360
they were going to give him a little
bit of money. He didn't even want it.

1997
01:43:08,361 --> 01:43:11,870
They donated it to a, to a
cause that he cares about. Um,

1998
01:43:12,530 --> 01:43:16,610
so I think what has happened here
is that learn liberty is a, uh,

1999
01:43:16,730 --> 01:43:20,210
subsidiary or in partnership with
Institute for Humane Studies,

2000
01:43:20,211 --> 01:43:24,560
which I think is through George Mason
University. And I believe that David Koch,

2001
01:43:24,561 --> 01:43:27,650
one of the Koch Brothers is on the board
there and must give some money to it.

2002
01:43:27,980 --> 01:43:32,870
I know for a fact that the person
who has funded our relationship,

2003
01:43:32,871 --> 01:43:35,600
my relationship with learn
liberty isn't anonymous woman.

2004
01:43:35,601 --> 01:43:38,510
And I know that because they told me that
she's anonymous and that it's a woman

2005
01:43:38,511 --> 01:43:40,250
and I personally wrote
her a thank you note.

2006
01:43:40,610 --> 01:43:45,440
I want to be 100%
spectacularly crystal clear.

2007
01:43:45,740 --> 01:43:50,540
They have had no control over our content.
I ask whatever questions I want.

2008
01:43:50,660 --> 01:43:55,340
We never edit for content.
We did once in my hundreds of interviews.

2009
01:43:55,460 --> 01:43:58,760
It was with a celebrity for a reason
that is completely irrelevant and not

2010
01:43:58,761 --> 01:44:03,500
important. They have never
told me anything to say. They,

2011
01:44:03,530 --> 01:44:07,220
there is nothing. There is literally
nothing untoward here. And I've,

2012
01:44:07,250 --> 01:44:11,160
and I've always, I always start the
episode by saying we're funded or were,

2013
01:44:11,220 --> 01:44:12,800
we're in partnership with learn liberty.

2014
01:44:12,801 --> 01:44:15,560
So we're funded by learn liberty
for that one episode. Anyway.

2015
01:44:15,561 --> 01:44:18,680
This is just endless dribble. And I,
it's almost like you can see I'm sort of,

2016
01:44:18,810 --> 01:44:22,010
yeah, it's like I don't even want to
talk about it cause it's like this is all

2017
01:44:22,011 --> 01:44:26,990
bullshit. This is all
distracting bullshit. And it's
like that's all nonsense.

2018
01:44:26,991 --> 01:44:30,410
And the amount that we get from them
by the way pales in comparison to,

2019
01:44:30,470 --> 01:44:34,460
to what we're trying to build on Patrion
and everything else. So it's like, no,

2020
01:44:34,461 --> 01:44:36,050
no one has ever told me to say anything.

2021
01:44:36,050 --> 01:44:37,700
No one has even ever
asked me to say anything.

2022
01:44:37,701 --> 01:44:40,520
I've never had contact with the cokes.
No one has ever said anything.

2023
01:44:40,670 --> 01:44:42,350
And by the way,
I would love to interview the cokes.

2024
01:44:42,351 --> 01:44:47,210
I would have literally no problem. The
Cokes Fund, um, the, the Cokes Fund, uh,

2025
01:44:47,240 --> 01:44:47,511
you know,

2026
01:44:47,511 --> 01:44:51,300
Lincoln Center and I think they put money
towards PBS and all sorts of actual,

2027
01:44:51,820 --> 01:44:54,230
yeah. So like I don't have
a problem with any of that.

2028
01:44:54,231 --> 01:44:58,670
So just to be crystal clear for anyone
listening to this or for any of these

2029
01:44:58,671 --> 01:45:00,890
people that just relentlessly
hate me or whatever,

2030
01:45:01,190 --> 01:45:03,200
I am not funded by the Koch brothers.

2031
01:45:03,430 --> 01:45:04,910
That's what you're saying is
you're funded by the Koch brothers.

2032
01:45:04,911 --> 01:45:06,970
[inaudible] there are millions,

2033
01:45:06,980 --> 01:45:10,640
there are millions of people in this
country who are, who donate to nonprofits.

2034
01:45:10,790 --> 01:45:12,650
And it's like if you
work with a nonprofit,

2035
01:45:12,651 --> 01:45:16,400
you might be in vendor in coots
and obviously control. It's just,

2036
01:45:16,610 --> 01:45:19,460
it's just so dumb. I hope we
cleaned that up, but you know,

2037
01:45:19,461 --> 01:45:22,670
I know it'll just give endless, here's,
here's another super chat question. Yeah.

2038
01:45:22,790 --> 01:45:27,790
Play prognosticator what our president
Trump's chances of reelection in 2020 I

2039
01:45:28,071 --> 01:45:31,010
would say basic short of some
sort of impeachment thing.

2040
01:45:31,011 --> 01:45:33,890
And I have to catch up on a little bit
of the news that you enlightened me on.

2041
01:45:34,250 --> 01:45:36,240
I would say basically pretty good if,

2042
01:45:36,241 --> 01:45:41,030
if the left's decision to go down the
road of identity politics and Social

2043
01:45:41,030 --> 01:45:43,330
Democrats, Socialists, Democrats, whatever
the hell they're called now. But the,

2044
01:45:43,331 --> 01:45:45,440
the Bernie Keith Ellison Wing,
which is an,

2045
01:45:45,590 --> 01:45:49,090
which is basically an
extremist wing of a party. Uh,

2046
01:45:49,100 --> 01:45:50,900
then they're going to be
in a lot of trouble if the,

2047
01:45:50,901 --> 01:45:54,800
if is there any blue dog Democrat left,
if that thing could come back,

2048
01:45:54,801 --> 01:45:57,020
a sensible liberal,
believe me,

2049
01:45:57,021 --> 01:46:00,170
I could vote for someone who's probably
a little more big government than I am.

2050
01:46:00,170 --> 01:46:04,550
I wish, and I talked about it for
years. I want my, I used to say my guys,

2051
01:46:04,551 --> 01:46:07,430
I wanted my side,
the left the Democrats to wake up.

2052
01:46:07,530 --> 01:46:11,660
There's no sign whatsoever that they're
going to wake up. Uh, potentially. Look,

2053
01:46:11,661 --> 01:46:16,070
if they get slammed in the midterms,
then maybe they wake up, but you,

2054
01:46:16,160 --> 01:46:17,210
you're predicting that they won't.

2055
01:46:17,240 --> 01:46:20,540
I suspect it's not going to be that
bad actually if you're a republican,

2056
01:46:20,541 --> 01:46:24,470
because I don't think there's anyone who
voted for Trump that suddenly looks at

2057
01:46:24,471 --> 01:46:28,820
the left and thinks that they're better,
but their numbers may just be depressed.

2058
01:46:28,821 --> 01:46:31,030
They may just not show up. And that's
always what happens in midterms.

2059
01:46:31,100 --> 01:46:34,400
And it's never good for the incumbent
presidents party and all that stuff.

2060
01:46:34,760 --> 01:46:39,380
But I suspect generally what they're
offering is, so it really is fringe.

2061
01:46:39,381 --> 01:46:42,590
And the only reason we don't think it's
fringe is because the mainstream media

2062
01:46:42,591 --> 01:46:47,060
jams it down our throat every day. And
if we can get that message out to people,

2063
01:46:47,061 --> 01:46:49,380
and I think you're a
particularly effective at it,

2064
01:46:49,381 --> 01:46:52,560
but we needed to also get to people
that won't listen to Ben Shapiro, right.

2065
01:46:52,710 --> 01:46:55,590
We need to get to people that'll
listen to me or, or whoever else,

2066
01:46:55,740 --> 01:46:57,390
people that listen to
Joe Rogan or whatever,

2067
01:46:57,630 --> 01:46:59,890
even though I know we all
have a lot of crossover. Uh,

2068
01:46:59,940 --> 01:47:01,230
if that message could get out there,

2069
01:47:01,231 --> 01:47:04,890
this thing that's being sold to you as
so obvious and good and the government

2070
01:47:04,891 --> 01:47:09,330
can fix everything and Blah, blah, blah,
if we can show them that is a fringe idea,

2071
01:47:09,930 --> 01:47:13,020
here are some better ways to
freedom, then I think, um,

2072
01:47:13,260 --> 01:47:14,520
we're forget Trump for a second.

2073
01:47:14,521 --> 01:47:16,740
I just think that that's a
much better path for a health.

2074
01:47:16,790 --> 01:47:17,080
He says,

2075
01:47:17,080 --> 01:47:20,180
I'm out in the political prognostication
business and so lost $10,000 for the

2076
01:47:20,181 --> 01:47:22,630
last election. By the way, I was

2077
01:47:22,850 --> 01:47:24,960
you the night of the election,
which I've told many people,

2078
01:47:25,010 --> 01:47:26,760
well actually I think we've
talked about it publicly,

2079
01:47:26,880 --> 01:47:28,970
but watching you that night,
you know

2080
01:47:29,010 --> 01:47:29,970
who's that?
It was entertaining.

2081
01:47:29,990 --> 01:47:30,621
It was like,

2082
01:47:30,621 --> 01:47:33,630
it was like being with like
eight different people try
to burst out upon. Yeah,

2083
01:47:34,970 --> 01:47:36,660
it was very wild. So yeah. You know, I'm,

2084
01:47:36,661 --> 01:47:39,550
I'm more skeptical at president Trump is
headed in a good path just because his

2085
01:47:39,551 --> 01:47:42,910
approval ratings are so low and there's
only a referendum on him once every four

2086
01:47:42,911 --> 01:47:47,020
years. So I think that, you know, 2018 is
shaping up pretty ugly for Republicans.

2087
01:47:47,021 --> 01:47:51,160
The turnout numbers don't look good or
Democrats are over representing pretty

2088
01:47:51,161 --> 01:47:52,810
much everywhere in the early elections.

2089
01:47:53,290 --> 01:47:55,300
Do I think it's going to be
like a 60 seat blowout? No,

2090
01:47:55,301 --> 01:47:57,970
but I think that there's a
good shot. Democrats went
about 35 seats in the house.

2091
01:47:58,360 --> 01:48:01,130
Again, I could be completely wrong
here. Right. So is the scariest. Yeah.

2092
01:48:01,150 --> 01:48:03,100
Part of that though, that lets, okay,

2093
01:48:03,101 --> 01:48:04,660
so let's say the Democrats
take back the house.

2094
01:48:04,720 --> 01:48:08,560
It's just endless investigations. I think
it's done for a couple of years. Also,

2095
01:48:08,620 --> 01:48:09,101
here's the thing,

2096
01:48:09,101 --> 01:48:14,080
president Trump is riding on excellent
news for the past couple of years.

2097
01:48:14,110 --> 01:48:17,830
He's at like 42% in the polls,
usually 43% in the polls.

2098
01:48:18,460 --> 01:48:21,670
He benefited number one from Gary Johnson
and Jill Stein winning a combined,

2099
01:48:21,671 --> 01:48:24,250
I think six,
7% of the vote in the last election cycle.

2100
01:48:24,251 --> 01:48:29,251
But also he has benefited now from a
great economy and no major foreign policy

2101
01:48:29,441 --> 01:48:30,274
crisis.

2102
01:48:30,310 --> 01:48:33,640
We're overdue for some sort of economic
downturn and there's one every eight to

2103
01:48:33,641 --> 01:48:37,990
10 years in the country. It's been since
2008. Uh, so I'm a little, you know, God,

2104
01:48:38,080 --> 01:48:38,621
God willing,

2105
01:48:38,621 --> 01:48:40,870
we avoid it and it just continues to
be strong because it'd be good for the

2106
01:48:40,871 --> 01:48:42,090
country,
but if they,

2107
01:48:42,510 --> 01:48:44,700
the, the idea that the
president is so in charge of,

2108
01:48:44,750 --> 01:48:48,230
he's not, he's not in charge of nearly
any of the economy. Yeah, it's, it's the,

2109
01:48:48,530 --> 01:48:50,480
I think the president can put a
serious damper on the economy,

2110
01:48:50,481 --> 01:48:54,380
but I don't think that the president can
be held responsible for the performance

2111
01:48:54,381 --> 01:48:57,380
of a particular economy.
Again, when people say Obama
was great for the economy,

2112
01:48:57,381 --> 01:48:57,840
it's like we'll sell.

2113
01:48:57,840 --> 01:49:00,140
Was the Republican congress great for
the economy because they were there since

2114
01:49:00,141 --> 01:49:03,210
2010 all of that said, you know, I,

2115
01:49:03,211 --> 01:49:05,870
I think Democrats are going
to turn out in droves in,

2116
01:49:05,871 --> 01:49:09,620
in 2020 in a way they didn't in 2016
the real story of 2016 to May was,

2117
01:49:09,621 --> 01:49:11,300
no one showed up to vote
for Hillary Clinton.

2118
01:49:11,301 --> 01:49:13,780
Like we're all focused on Trump because
he's the center of the universe. Right?

2119
01:49:13,840 --> 01:49:16,700
But the reality is that was a referendum
on Hillary, not a referendum on Trump.

2120
01:49:17,060 --> 01:49:19,100
Trump's approval rating
for absolutely stable.

2121
01:49:19,100 --> 01:49:20,930
They were always between 40 and 44%.

2122
01:49:21,050 --> 01:49:24,140
Hillary's bouncing around from 40
to 50 because people would say, oh,

2123
01:49:24,141 --> 01:49:26,320
well maybe she'll be good, and then
they'd look at her like, Oh God,

2124
01:49:26,321 --> 01:49:28,490
isn't that awful? And they
just wouldn't show up. Right.

2125
01:49:28,540 --> 01:49:31,610
You won fewer votes in the state of
what Donald Trump won fewer votes in the

2126
01:49:31,611 --> 01:49:33,170
state of Wisconsin than Mitt Romney did.

2127
01:49:33,171 --> 01:49:35,600
In 2012 Trump won the state of Wisconsin.

2128
01:49:35,630 --> 01:49:38,390
Romney lost the state of Wisconsin because
no one showed up to vote for Hillary

2129
01:49:38,390 --> 01:49:40,700
Clinton. I think Democratic turnout
in 2020 is going to be real high.

2130
01:49:40,730 --> 01:49:43,730
Trump has to win somewhere between 12
and 14 million additional votes between

2131
01:49:43,731 --> 01:49:48,130
2016 and 2020 in order to win because
George W had to win additional 10 million

2132
01:49:48,131 --> 01:49:53,110
votes to win, and he only lost by 500,000
in the popular vote. So how can that,

2133
01:49:53,170 --> 01:49:55,860
how can Republicans win? Democrats
can be awful. Right? I mean, that's,

2134
01:49:55,870 --> 01:49:57,250
that's what you're basically saying.
Yeah.

2135
01:49:57,280 --> 01:49:59,560
And so it's always a head
to head match up. Yeah.

2136
01:49:59,561 --> 01:50:01,330
If Democrats were on Kamala Harris,
Trump will win.

2137
01:50:01,450 --> 01:50:04,710
If Democrats were on Elizabeth Warren,
I think Trump probably lens, uh,

2138
01:50:04,730 --> 01:50:07,120
if they were on Kirsten Gillibrand
who will definitely one,

2139
01:50:07,300 --> 01:50:08,320
if they run Joe Biden,

2140
01:50:08,680 --> 01:50:12,570
I think it's an uphill run for
president Trump in the election. Yeah.

2141
01:50:12,650 --> 01:50:14,910
Bad is that you'd need to bring in this,
I don't know how old,

2142
01:50:15,440 --> 01:50:19,290
7,270 I'll be 78. Oh God. He'll be 78.

2143
01:50:19,291 --> 01:50:22,320
Trump will be 74 and the two of them will
just club each other with their canes.

2144
01:50:22,780 --> 01:50:23,990
Don't like the,
uh,

2145
01:50:24,200 --> 01:50:27,420
you know how many tennis balls we'll go
through running on the bottom of those

2146
01:50:27,421 --> 01:50:31,080
walkers. Yeah. Okay. Here's, here's one.
As a practicing Jew and as an atheist,

2147
01:50:31,230 --> 01:50:34,260
what are both of your thoughts on the
swing towards sexual freedom and sexual

2148
01:50:34,261 --> 01:50:37,740
freedom? Pre-Marriage? Has It negatively
effected longterm relationships?

2149
01:50:38,910 --> 01:50:39,743
Can I hit this one?

2150
01:50:40,190 --> 01:50:43,290
Yeah. Well first off I would say
this is why if, okay. Practicing.

2151
01:50:43,370 --> 01:50:46,200
So this is where I'm saying you're
a practicing Jew is a little,

2152
01:50:46,530 --> 01:50:50,130
it's hard to know what that means because
I would say you're on the sort of more

2153
01:50:50,160 --> 01:50:50,890
uh,

2154
01:50:50,890 --> 01:50:55,210
modern orthodox strict but strict side of
that and that your rights, you're okay.

2155
01:50:55,360 --> 01:50:58,580
Versus the version until I
was married. Yes. Right. Okay.
Okay. So you are all right.

2156
01:50:58,610 --> 01:50:58,820
Yeah.

2157
01:50:58,820 --> 01:51:00,620
Um,
so I would say this,

2158
01:51:00,621 --> 01:51:04,760
this is another reason where people
should basically be for gay marriage,

2159
01:51:04,790 --> 01:51:07,820
not from the libertarian perspective,
although of course that's,

2160
01:51:07,940 --> 01:51:10,520
I think the most honest perspective is
that the government shouldn't be in your

2161
01:51:10,521 --> 01:51:13,640
business. But also from
a, if you think, you know,

2162
01:51:13,641 --> 01:51:17,000
I think that when the Wright was really
fearmongering for many years about gays

2163
01:51:17,140 --> 01:51:21,080
and the Huckabee's and the evangelicals
were always, you know, and George W.

2164
01:51:21,080 --> 01:51:22,690
Bush because of Karl Rove,
you know,

2165
01:51:22,790 --> 01:51:24,950
used gay marriage as a wedge
issue and there were saying,

2166
01:51:24,951 --> 01:51:25,671
we'll look at the games.

2167
01:51:25,671 --> 01:51:28,100
They're all having all these sex and
they're doing all these drugs and about,

2168
01:51:28,460 --> 01:51:29,001
well guess what?

2169
01:51:29,001 --> 01:51:33,380
If you don't let people have the same
ability to love someone that they love,

2170
01:51:33,381 --> 01:51:37,640
if you don't let people enter the same
exact legal protections as everybody else,

2171
01:51:37,880 --> 01:51:42,440
then people are going to act out in
all sorts of ways. Sexually, drugs,

2172
01:51:42,441 --> 01:51:45,650
all sorts of things. I did all sorts of
things. I never thought I was going to,

2173
01:51:45,651 --> 01:51:48,050
I never really thought about
marriage. I just didn't. I,

2174
01:51:48,370 --> 01:51:49,700
I was closeted for a long time.

2175
01:51:49,701 --> 01:51:52,760
I think I was all sorts of
whacked out in in many ways.

2176
01:51:53,060 --> 01:51:57,500
But if you take a certain subset
of people and say to them,

2177
01:51:57,501 --> 01:52:00,800
you can't have the things that other
people have that will eventually maybe

2178
01:52:00,801 --> 01:52:05,000
allow you to have a family or whatever
else. And usually you can't have those,

2179
01:52:05,450 --> 01:52:08,600
well then every,
all your sex is going to be premarital.

2180
01:52:08,601 --> 01:52:11,120
So if your answer is well, because I
hear this, sometimes people will say,

2181
01:52:11,121 --> 01:52:14,690
well gaze, she just be, you can be gay
but just be celibate. You know that's one.

2182
01:52:14,691 --> 01:52:17,750
I mean it's ridiculous
and it's like you have to,

2183
01:52:17,780 --> 01:52:22,310
this is why gays are conservatives.
I think really it's the,

2184
01:52:22,490 --> 01:52:24,950
it's happened already so it
doesn't even really matter,

2185
01:52:25,160 --> 01:52:30,160
but it's like you should be for gay
marriage in a way that actually is for all

2186
01:52:31,791 --> 01:52:36,580
the other things. You're four because
you guys want a certain title, stability

2187
01:52:36,730 --> 01:52:38,110
and everything else for same sex marriage,

2188
01:52:38,650 --> 01:52:40,960
same sex marriage is the one that you
just made it even better than the,

2189
01:52:41,480 --> 01:52:45,170
the equal rights argument
cause equal rights argument.
You could easily say, well,

2190
01:52:45,171 --> 01:52:47,240
the role of marriage in between
a man and woman and man,

2191
01:52:47,241 --> 01:52:49,820
man is a little bit different just because
of natural child bearing and rearing

2192
01:52:49,821 --> 01:52:54,200
that hers the way why you guys didn't
make this argument before, right?

2193
01:52:54,201 --> 01:52:57,830
Like you weren't pounding the libertarian
argument for gay marriage eight years

2194
01:52:57,831 --> 01:52:58,250
ago.

2195
01:52:58,250 --> 01:53:03,250
I started hitting it in about 2012 2013
so that was probably a little bit before

2196
01:53:03,321 --> 01:53:07,150
most conservatives came around. But
generally libertarians, even worse,

2197
01:53:07,210 --> 01:53:10,640
I guess liberal real libertarian idea was
basically I want the government out of

2198
01:53:10,641 --> 01:53:12,840
everything. The government sucks
at everything. But as far as the,

2199
01:53:12,841 --> 01:53:15,560
the argument in favor
of same sex marriage,

2200
01:53:15,561 --> 01:53:19,500
if the argument is in favor of stable,
you know,

2201
01:53:19,670 --> 01:53:21,440
two person relationships
as opposed to wow,

2202
01:53:21,441 --> 01:53:25,720
promiscuity in every circumstance that
is going to be superior. But imagine,

2203
01:53:25,750 --> 01:53:29,310
imagine telling the subset of people,
I mean, imagine if the world was worse.

2204
01:53:29,350 --> 01:53:32,840
Gays were the majority and straights with
the room. And I said to you, you Ben,

2205
01:53:32,841 --> 01:53:37,430
you cannot marry a woman. Well now
you're going to do all sorts of things.

2206
01:53:37,431 --> 01:53:40,830
Like it just is. I hear,
I hear the argument.

2207
01:53:41,330 --> 01:53:43,310
It's interesting cause I think we
actually have a slight disagreement here.

2208
01:53:43,311 --> 01:53:45,590
If somebody were to say that
to me and my argument would be,

2209
01:53:45,591 --> 01:53:48,710
well I don't understand why I societal
institutions would make the decision for

2210
01:53:48,711 --> 01:53:50,600
me as to whether I should
live with one person or not.

2211
01:53:50,660 --> 01:53:53,770
Well if anybody's eye meaning
that like even if societies,

2212
01:53:53,840 --> 01:53:56,840
like as as a person who is a libertarian
on the government issue of marriage,

2213
01:53:57,320 --> 01:54:01,580
my vision is, well I go to my synagogue
and that provides me the Avo legitimacy.

2214
01:54:01,581 --> 01:54:02,840
I feel like I need with my spouse,

2215
01:54:02,841 --> 01:54:04,910
which is why I say like if gay people
want to get married in their church,

2216
01:54:04,911 --> 01:54:09,050
go for it. Like a toy. But
it's, but it's, you know, I,

2217
01:54:09,120 --> 01:54:13,340
I think it's hard to make the case that
promiscuity is deeply connected with

2218
01:54:13,341 --> 01:54:17,620
lack of same sex marriage.
I think that promiscuity is,

2219
01:54:17,621 --> 01:54:20,720
is connected with personal decision
making just because what you see is that

2220
01:54:20,721 --> 01:54:23,450
there's a riot, wild raise, rising
promiscuity in the straight committee.

2221
01:54:23,451 --> 01:54:24,141
Forget the gay community.

2222
01:54:24,141 --> 01:54:27,730
There's wild rise in rates of promise
Hillary on swiping right. And that far,

2223
01:54:27,740 --> 01:54:30,620
I guess you swipe left if you want it.
No idea, dude. It's a sweater and the,

2224
01:54:30,770 --> 01:54:34,490
I know it's all about a swipe. But if you
look at the rates of single motherhood,

2225
01:54:34,491 --> 01:54:36,590
for example, those who have been
on the rise since the 1960s.

2226
01:54:36,830 --> 01:54:40,370
And that's in a situation where straight
people are allowed to get married and

2227
01:54:40,371 --> 01:54:42,800
they have been allowed to get
married to historically. So the,

2228
01:54:42,830 --> 01:54:47,300
so correlating the institution of
marriage with, with promiscuity,

2229
01:54:47,301 --> 01:54:50,240
I think is a difficult argument to
make just statistically speaking.

2230
01:54:51,540 --> 01:54:55,550
But if the argument is that
that institutionalizing
marriage will make people

2231
01:54:55,551 --> 01:54:58,200
less promiscuous,
then I think that's actually a,

2232
01:54:58,290 --> 01:55:00,770
that's the best argument for same sex
marriage. I think that's out there.

2233
01:55:00,771 --> 01:55:02,480
If I were going to steal man
the same sex marriage argument,

2234
01:55:02,481 --> 01:55:04,490
that'd be the argument that you
need more stable relationships.

2235
01:55:04,580 --> 01:55:05,750
You need less instability.

2236
01:55:05,840 --> 01:55:08,660
You need people who feel that that's
actually a positive societal good to live

2237
01:55:08,661 --> 01:55:11,120
with one person as opposed to living
with a hundred other people. You know,

2238
01:55:11,121 --> 01:55:13,850
that's, that's, uh, you know, that,
that I think is the strongest argument.

2239
01:55:13,851 --> 01:55:18,480
So are you saying you're four
and forced monogamy? Oh Man,

2240
01:55:19,100 --> 01:55:22,400
man, that, that whole thing is so
stupid. It's so stupid. But, but it is,

2241
01:55:22,401 --> 01:55:26,900
it is true that a society that every
social science study ever done has shown

2242
01:55:27,020 --> 01:55:29,300
that when people live together
a long time before marriage,

2243
01:55:29,360 --> 01:55:32,240
they tend to get divorced at higher
rates than they would if they weren't,

2244
01:55:32,460 --> 01:55:33,980
if they just gotten married,
basically.

2245
01:55:34,220 --> 01:55:37,400
And the reason for that is I think
that if you, if you look at the,

2246
01:55:37,460 --> 01:55:41,930
at the research on passion and,
and sort of committed love,

2247
01:55:42,470 --> 01:55:45,000
they move in opposite directions
over the course of a relationship.

2248
01:55:45,010 --> 01:55:46,260
So when you first meet somebody,

2249
01:55:46,530 --> 01:55:49,740
your passion level is incredibly high and
your level of committed love, meaning,

2250
01:55:49,800 --> 01:55:51,870
you know,
I know this person really well,

2251
01:55:51,871 --> 01:55:53,520
I can count on this person is really low.

2252
01:55:53,670 --> 01:55:57,150
And then about six months in passionate
logos goes like that are committed love

2253
01:55:57,151 --> 01:56:00,150
goes like that, which is why if you've
married 10 years like I have, then,

2254
01:56:00,210 --> 01:56:01,920
you know, I'm, I'm really
passionate about my wife.

2255
01:56:01,921 --> 01:56:05,100
But to pretend that it's the same
level of like sexual attention. Yeah.

2256
01:56:05,150 --> 01:56:08,850
It's somebody that I'm dating as 10
years later with two kids. Of course,

2257
01:56:08,851 --> 01:56:10,650
that's not true.
That doesn't mean I have bad sex,

2258
01:56:10,651 --> 01:56:11,670
like I have a wonderful sex life,

2259
01:56:11,700 --> 01:56:14,520
but it's a different thing than it
was at the very beginning. Well,

2260
01:56:14,521 --> 01:56:17,890
if you correlate in your mind that
what's great about a relationship as a

2261
01:56:17,891 --> 01:56:19,020
passion level and that,

2262
01:56:19,110 --> 01:56:21,180
and then you lived together with
somebody for six months and then you get

2263
01:56:21,181 --> 01:56:23,800
married and then your passion
level decreases, you mistake the,

2264
01:56:23,801 --> 01:56:26,040
the correlation for the
causation, say, oh, it's marriage.

2265
01:56:26,041 --> 01:56:27,510
They caused the passion level to decline.

2266
01:56:27,690 --> 01:56:30,450
Not the fact that I've been living
with someone for awhile. Also,

2267
01:56:30,451 --> 01:56:33,100
the fact is that the reason people
aren't getting married in general and in

2268
01:56:33,120 --> 01:56:35,220
society where you're allowed to
get married, gay or straight,

2269
01:56:35,420 --> 01:56:37,250
I is because you don't want to rate.

2270
01:56:37,450 --> 01:56:40,560
That means that you're already got
an eye on the door in many cases.

2271
01:56:40,590 --> 01:56:44,840
And that's not a real flattering idea
for a lot of folks. So, you know, pre,

2272
01:56:44,960 --> 01:56:46,890
I think promiscuity is,
first of all,

2273
01:56:46,891 --> 01:56:49,590
I think that one of the worst lies
perpetrated against women is the women in

2274
01:56:49,600 --> 01:56:52,080
mentoree sex in exactly the same way,
which is absurd.

2275
01:56:52,680 --> 01:56:56,160
The idea that promiscuity is good
for women in the same way that it is,

2276
01:56:56,161 --> 01:56:59,010
quote unquote good for
men is fully insane.

2277
01:56:59,011 --> 01:57:01,200
I don't think it's good for
either from a moral perspective,

2278
01:57:01,201 --> 01:57:03,030
from a spiritual perspective,
from a health perspective,

2279
01:57:03,240 --> 01:57:07,000
but I think that the amount of damage
that is done spiritually to women, uh,

2280
01:57:07,290 --> 01:57:10,200
who are, who are promiscuous on
average, not for every individual.

2281
01:57:10,230 --> 01:57:12,660
It's a free country, do what
you want, but the, on average,

2282
01:57:12,661 --> 01:57:15,270
the amount of psychological damage that
is done to 16 year old girls who are

2283
01:57:15,271 --> 01:57:18,660
promiscuous is not nearly the same
amount of damage that it's wildly

2284
01:57:18,661 --> 01:57:21,230
disproportionate to
two men who are having,

2285
01:57:21,330 --> 01:57:24,430
right guys. Good. [inaudible]
highly correlative.

2286
01:57:24,620 --> 01:57:28,340
The guy in high school who's like banging
a lot of the cheerleaders doesn't,

2287
01:57:28,520 --> 01:57:30,900
it doesn't stick with him in
a sort of psychological I,

2288
01:57:30,940 --> 01:57:32,130
the suicide rates are not the same.
Yeah.

2289
01:57:32,830 --> 01:57:33,131
Among,

2290
01:57:33,131 --> 01:57:36,400
among young men who are promiscuous is
not even close to the suicide rate among

2291
01:57:36,430 --> 01:57:39,910
young, I mean leads to actual correlation
between earlier sex for young women

2292
01:57:39,911 --> 01:57:44,110
particularly, uh, and, and suicide
rates. And that's because women and men,

2293
01:57:44,111 --> 01:57:45,040
and we all used to know this,

2294
01:57:45,041 --> 01:57:47,740
but women and men treat sex differently
because women and men are not the same.

2295
01:57:47,741 --> 01:57:47,840
Yeah,

2296
01:57:47,840 --> 01:57:48,830
yeah. We should do a bit, well,

2297
01:57:48,831 --> 01:57:52,610
I want to do some big IDW panels in
general and maybe do some stuff live and I

2298
01:57:52,611 --> 01:57:54,380
think we're discussing all
sorts of stuff and all that,

2299
01:57:54,590 --> 01:57:58,280
but this would be a really rich topic
for sure because it does raise questions

2300
01:57:58,281 --> 01:58:00,700
as to like, what should we
promote as a society? You know,

2301
01:58:00,710 --> 01:58:03,160
forget about government regulation
and what, what's your merchants?

2302
01:58:03,170 --> 01:58:06,380
What are the basic, what are the basic
social institutions that are necessary?

2303
01:58:06,400 --> 01:58:06,540
Yeah.

2304
01:58:06,540 --> 01:58:10,860
And is it possible that we totally left
up relations between the sexes and the

2305
01:58:10,861 --> 01:58:15,861
future of longterm relationships
and marriage by separating
sex from marriage in

2306
01:58:15,931 --> 01:58:19,320
a really significant way, which, which
began really before even the 60s.

2307
01:58:19,321 --> 01:58:19,681
I mean there's a,

2308
01:58:19,681 --> 01:58:23,430
there's a decline in marriage that it
started before even the advent of the

2309
01:58:23,431 --> 01:58:24,800
sexual revolution per se.
Yeah.

2310
01:58:25,110 --> 01:58:29,880
Let's see, maybe a couple of more. Yeah.
Uh, okay. So, um, you're a good man.

2311
01:58:29,881 --> 01:58:31,690
I know you have a real job
and everything. Oh yeah. Yeah.

2312
01:58:31,710 --> 01:58:34,450
And I have to go write a bunch
of crap after this. So, um,

2313
01:58:34,530 --> 01:58:36,990
let's see it and then another, another
one we'll do, let's do the last one here.

2314
01:58:36,991 --> 01:58:39,400
So, okay. Um, hm.

2315
01:58:40,440 --> 01:58:43,360
Does a political scale with statism on
the left and anarchy on the ride this

2316
01:58:43,361 --> 01:58:46,390
from Patrion? What? Constitutional
law constitutionalism wise,

2317
01:58:46,420 --> 01:58:49,090
a bit right of center make more
sense than the traditional left,

2318
01:58:49,091 --> 01:58:52,780
right scale we use. Where does liberty
lie on the traditional left, right scale?

2319
01:58:54,250 --> 01:58:57,490
Um, I feel like we could do
something a little more exciting.

2320
01:58:57,540 --> 01:59:00,510
Okay. What's her letters? But I mean, why
don't we both do that one in 30 seconds?

2321
01:59:00,730 --> 01:59:02,010
It's something like a
little more excitable.

2322
01:59:02,080 --> 01:59:04,110
The 32nd answer is that
statism on the left,

2323
01:59:04,111 --> 01:59:07,920
the anarchy on the right is basically
the American political scale. The,

2324
01:59:07,940 --> 01:59:12,730
the European political scale is
nationalism versus international. Right.

2325
01:59:12,930 --> 01:59:14,670
And so,
and we're shifting towards that.

2326
01:59:14,671 --> 01:59:16,050
We are shifting toward
that and it's dangerous.

2327
01:59:16,051 --> 01:59:18,750
Like I think that the political skeleton
statism is on the left and anarchy is

2328
01:59:18,751 --> 01:59:21,780
on the right. Uh, I think that
that's, that is a better scale.

2329
01:59:21,781 --> 01:59:24,410
I think it's a more accurate scale. Yeah.
I don't mean to dismiss the question.

2330
01:59:24,450 --> 01:59:27,580
I'll do more than y'all do something on
this question on Patrion itself, but,

2331
01:59:27,630 --> 01:59:31,380
but for our big finish here, I feel like,
yeah, I already come out of Benjamin.

2332
01:59:31,450 --> 01:59:33,630
Okay, here we go. Here we
go. Them. Would you agree?

2333
01:59:34,170 --> 01:59:36,110
Would you agree with the idea
that classically speaking,

2334
01:59:36,111 --> 01:59:38,430
the left and the right have a
fundamental disagreement on human nature?

2335
01:59:38,670 --> 01:59:42,030
I Emam being inherently good or evil.
Keep up the great work. Yeah, we're okay.

2336
01:59:42,031 --> 01:59:43,060
Let's recommendation questions.

2337
01:59:43,120 --> 01:59:47,100
Do human nature. The first, let
me just tell you what I believe.

2338
01:59:47,370 --> 01:59:51,120
I believe people are basically good.

2339
01:59:51,720 --> 01:59:54,000
I believe you are.
You are born.

2340
01:59:54,180 --> 01:59:56,850
I think I pretty much buy
into Pinker's blank slate.

2341
01:59:56,851 --> 01:59:59,040
But I think you're basically born good.

2342
01:59:59,041 --> 02:00:03,150
There's something innately
human that you want to do good.

2343
02:00:03,600 --> 02:00:06,360
Doesn't mean we do good all the time.
We all do all sorts of things.

2344
02:00:06,361 --> 02:00:08,670
We lie and we cheat and
we do this and that. And,

2345
02:00:08,671 --> 02:00:11,630
and you have moments in your life where
we can all look back and go, Whoa,

2346
02:00:12,150 --> 02:00:14,190
you know, those couple of
years I was really doing some,

2347
02:00:14,191 --> 02:00:18,840
some self destructive shed or,
or some whatever it is. Um,

2348
02:00:18,900 --> 02:00:22,950
but I think there is something uniquely
human about wanting to do good.

2349
02:00:22,951 --> 02:00:25,830
It's how it's,
how human flourishing has existed.

2350
02:00:25,831 --> 02:00:30,150
It's not just because of the stuff that
we can empirically test and all that.

2351
02:00:30,150 --> 02:00:32,490
There was something
else about being human,

2352
02:00:32,491 --> 02:00:35,790
that little spark that you see in a baby's
eye when they know something's funny

2353
02:00:35,791 --> 02:00:39,120
and they can't even speak.
Like there is something else that is,

2354
02:00:39,540 --> 02:00:42,480
that is there, that is
human, that is good.

2355
02:00:42,481 --> 02:00:47,481
And I think it's sort of your job to
try to enhance that as much as possible.

2356
02:00:48,660 --> 02:00:50,850
At least I see that as my
job and I'm trying and I,

2357
02:00:51,060 --> 02:00:54,150
I will fail often and
I'll continue to fail. Um,

2358
02:00:54,180 --> 02:00:59,180
but I'm really trying to be the best
person that I can be while I am here.

2359
02:00:59,701 --> 02:01:03,510
And I think that comes from something
that's way before me that comes from

2360
02:01:03,511 --> 02:01:07,830
something that I can't prove
with tools here and measurements.

2361
02:01:08,040 --> 02:01:10,140
Like it's just something that is,

2362
02:01:10,500 --> 02:01:13,850
I think that's probably a little bit
of what your answer is, but maybe,

2363
02:01:14,140 --> 02:01:16,690
yeah. I mean, I do too. To
a lot of folks on the left.

2364
02:01:17,230 --> 02:01:20,620
The idea that human beings are inherently
good means that if we just unshackle

2365
02:01:20,621 --> 02:01:24,500
you from the bounds of society is
through the Russo idea that this was,

2366
02:01:24,540 --> 02:01:27,250
that your innate goodness will spring
forth and everything will be great.

2367
02:01:27,460 --> 02:01:29,980
Or from the Martin idea,
if you just change the economic system,

2368
02:01:29,981 --> 02:01:32,320
then we will all be inherently better
and we'll see each other as brothers as

2369
02:01:32,321 --> 02:01:35,860
opposed to enemies. So I am of
the kind of founding fathers idea,

2370
02:01:35,861 --> 02:01:37,180
which is basically a biblical idea,

2371
02:01:37,181 --> 02:01:39,980
which is that people are not angels
and not devils. Where human beings,

2372
02:01:40,240 --> 02:01:42,680
they have capacity for good.
We have capacity for evil. Uh,

2373
02:01:43,040 --> 02:01:46,460
while I love my two and a half
year old son, he's a nutcase and a,

2374
02:01:46,490 --> 02:01:49,310
and working in adult, he would be the
worst person in the world. He is, he,

2375
02:01:49,311 --> 02:01:49,521
you know,

2376
02:01:49,521 --> 02:01:52,160
he wants what he wants and he wants it
when he wants it and he doesn't care

2377
02:01:52,161 --> 02:01:55,910
about hitting people and you don't think
he's innately good or innately evil.

2378
02:01:55,911 --> 02:01:59,810
You think he just is as a human and
it's sort of your job as a parent.

2379
02:01:59,840 --> 02:02:03,650
This is what society's job
civilization and inculcating virtue.

2380
02:02:03,651 --> 02:02:04,700
That's your job as an adult.

2381
02:02:04,701 --> 02:02:07,580
And I think that the danger and the
belief that people are inherently good is

2382
02:02:07,581 --> 02:02:09,350
the idea if you just free them,
everything is okay.

2383
02:02:09,440 --> 02:02:11,810
Well freedom from political
institutions is one thing,

2384
02:02:11,811 --> 02:02:15,080
but freeing them from social fabric and
social institutions as a whole nother

2385
02:02:15,081 --> 02:02:16,430
thing.
So this is where I would say,

2386
02:02:16,431 --> 02:02:20,210
this is why I still consider myself a
classical liberal and not a libertarian

2387
02:02:20,211 --> 02:02:25,010
because I do think there is some role
for government and it's to protect those

2388
02:02:25,011 --> 02:02:27,170
things. And for me it's not even
about the role of government.

2389
02:02:27,171 --> 02:02:30,380
I think are libertarians really go
wrong is the suggestion that social

2390
02:02:30,381 --> 02:02:33,110
institutions are the cause
of all the world's evils.

2391
02:02:33,111 --> 02:02:35,000
That what we really need is
get rid of all knocked down,

2392
02:02:35,001 --> 02:02:37,070
all the churches knocked down all of the,

2393
02:02:37,071 --> 02:02:41,810
the places that are inculcating
virtue and [inaudible] will dictate.

2394
02:02:41,900 --> 02:02:45,320
Right. Of course. But, but
you know, somebody asked here
about debating arm broke.

2395
02:02:45,321 --> 02:02:48,710
I've invited yard on my program for
specifically this cause I ran. Oh,

2396
02:02:48,711 --> 02:02:50,620
are you guys doing it? I
know, I know he wants to do,

2397
02:02:50,630 --> 02:02:53,830
I mean I love to have him on that.
I'm happy to do it here. I know. Yeah.

2398
02:02:54,060 --> 02:02:55,550
I mean I think that we
disagree on less then.

2399
02:02:55,580 --> 02:02:58,180
I think that there's some
semantic games being played about,

2400
02:02:58,181 --> 02:03:01,100
about objectivism and what exactly is
self interest in all this other stuff.

2401
02:03:01,220 --> 02:03:05,390
Let's do, no, I'm happy to. I'm happy to
do that. But it's uh, but with that said,

2402
02:03:05,391 --> 02:03:10,391
I think that recognizing the human
beings are capable of evil is a deeply

2403
02:03:10,701 --> 02:03:14,300
important thing to recognizing that
you have to as an adult cultivate your

2404
02:03:14,301 --> 02:03:17,270
children in a way that they are
going to be good. So is that,

2405
02:03:17,271 --> 02:03:18,530
is that different though than what I said?

2406
02:03:18,531 --> 02:03:23,531
Because I believe we are born good but
it doesn't mean that evil evil he or or

2407
02:03:23,991 --> 02:03:27,670
that evil can generate through a
lot of people. I, yeah, I mean I,

2408
02:03:27,680 --> 02:03:31,190
I'm very reticent to use the language
we're born good cause I don't think that

2409
02:03:31,191 --> 02:03:34,910
babies are born with an innate, I
think I've born with a basic, basic,

2410
02:03:34,911 --> 02:03:37,820
innate moral sense,
but it's really basic and non cultivated.

2411
02:03:38,120 --> 02:03:40,460
And I think that if you had
a baby's mortality, if the,

2412
02:03:40,640 --> 02:03:42,980
if the world were run by babies,
we'd all be dead.

2413
02:03:43,610 --> 02:03:46,400
And not just because they're not
giving you should also because they're,

2414
02:03:46,460 --> 02:03:48,290
they're not moral,
they're not moral creatures.

2415
02:03:48,291 --> 02:03:49,460
They want what they
want when they want it.

2416
02:03:49,730 --> 02:03:52,070
I think that that's something
that has to be cultivated by,

2417
02:03:52,100 --> 02:03:57,100
by society and reason is something
that must be cultivated over time.

2418
02:03:57,141 --> 02:04:00,440
And that's why it's a constant attempt by
anyone who's good to try and say, okay,

2419
02:04:00,441 --> 02:04:03,290
what is impacting my reason here is
a passion that's impacting my reason.

2420
02:04:03,500 --> 02:04:06,570
Is it bias that's impacting my reason?
What is it that's,

2421
02:04:06,580 --> 02:04:10,160
that's making me unreasonable about
this thing and more reasonable,

2422
02:04:10,161 --> 02:04:13,280
we are hopefully the better we are as
human beings because we've actually fully

2423
02:04:13,281 --> 02:04:15,380
considered the ramifications of the,

2424
02:04:15,381 --> 02:04:17,690
of the policies that we're pursuing and
the actions that we're taking in our

2425
02:04:17,691 --> 02:04:21,590
daily lives. So I'm, I'm
very into the risks of the,

2426
02:04:21,620 --> 02:04:24,950
what we call an in Judaism, the gates of
her Ravi, you know, I mean, you know this,

2427
02:04:24,951 --> 02:04:26,690
right? There's the HR, I told
him there's the [inaudible],

2428
02:04:26,840 --> 02:04:29,140
there's kind of the good inclination
in the bat inclination and the idea in

2429
02:04:29,141 --> 02:04:31,470
Judaism is they're constantly
at war with one another. Uh,

2430
02:04:31,480 --> 02:04:34,730
and it's your job to try and strengthen
the eights or hot tub so that it

2431
02:04:34,731 --> 02:04:38,090
overcomes the HR. I think that's
the struggle of mankind. And it's a,

2432
02:04:38,130 --> 02:04:41,750
it's a Christian notion as well. I mean,
the idea of the, the fall, you know,

2433
02:04:41,790 --> 02:04:45,660
in sin is now embedded in
you. Uh, and even after,

2434
02:04:45,750 --> 02:04:48,630
after Jesus is coming about,
you still have to struggle with that.

2435
02:04:48,631 --> 02:04:52,020
Obviously used to struggle with the,
the Satan behind you basically. Um,

2436
02:04:52,050 --> 02:04:55,340
but I think that recognizing
the capacity for evil is,

2437
02:04:55,380 --> 02:04:57,870
is perhaps the first
step in becoming good.

2438
02:04:58,260 --> 02:05:01,110
And so this is why I'm extraordinarily
reticent to say man is naturally good.

2439
02:05:01,111 --> 02:05:03,540
I think man is naturally, uh, neither.

2440
02:05:03,541 --> 02:05:07,770
I think man is naturally driven
towards self interest and asking us and

2441
02:05:07,860 --> 02:05:12,270
tribalism and evil and man
is naturally driven to,

2442
02:05:12,480 --> 02:05:15,660
to fight that sort of stuff in,
in a variety of ways.

2443
02:05:16,080 --> 02:05:20,130
But it requires an act of will in
order to overcome all of those other

2444
02:05:20,131 --> 02:05:20,880
inclinations.

2445
02:05:20,880 --> 02:05:23,880
Yeah. And I can, I can get on
board all of that. And I stilled,

2446
02:05:23,881 --> 02:05:25,680
my fundamental belief is that
people are good, but you still,

2447
02:05:25,681 --> 02:05:26,520
you do have to cultivate it.

2448
02:05:27,120 --> 02:05:29,770
I think so. I think people in Western
society are good and I think that's,

2449
02:05:29,890 --> 02:05:32,850
that's an outgrowth of, of
several thousand years of
history. I think that if,

2450
02:05:32,860 --> 02:05:34,230
if we dropped you a lot of roommates,

2451
02:05:34,300 --> 02:05:36,780
I think if we dropped in the middle
of Afghanistan, you'd be pretty often,

2452
02:05:36,940 --> 02:05:39,640
I'd be probably very different
than I am right now. Uh,

2453
02:05:39,680 --> 02:05:43,570
as Peterson always says on this topic,
the devil's in the details. So, uh,

2454
02:05:43,600 --> 02:05:45,580
well I gotta tell you, man, first
off, thank you for doing this.

2455
02:05:45,581 --> 02:05:48,580
I know you're busy as hell and I'm, and
you know, you were the right guy to,

2456
02:05:48,610 --> 02:05:51,740
to sit down again. As I say, I'm
always happy to wreck your day. So,

2457
02:05:53,420 --> 02:05:58,390
um, you know, this, it's, I'm glad that
we also ended on this note because this,

2458
02:05:58,391 --> 02:06:02,950
that conversation that we just had I
think is what I think really matters.

2459
02:06:02,951 --> 02:06:04,600
And I think that's why people are showing,
you know,

2460
02:06:04,601 --> 02:06:06,460
thousands of people are
showing up to your live event.

2461
02:06:06,700 --> 02:06:09,520
Thousands of people are showing up to
these events that I'm doing with Peterson.

2462
02:06:09,670 --> 02:06:11,900
And by the way were were, I'll
do a live stream later, but we,

2463
02:06:11,901 --> 02:06:16,901
we just extended the tour into 2019
people don't want this endless bloodshed,

2464
02:06:17,230 --> 02:06:21,780
this mutually assured destruction.
And uh, I'll keep trying to,

2465
02:06:22,860 --> 02:06:26,070
and what is obvious is that headline of
the day is less important than the big

2466
02:06:26,071 --> 02:06:26,904
ideas.

2467
02:06:26,910 --> 02:06:29,550
And so trying to escape headline of the
day is sounds like it was a good idea

2468
02:06:29,551 --> 02:06:29,910
for you.

2469
02:06:29,910 --> 02:06:32,400
Yeah. All right, well thank you. Shapiro.
I'm going to go here for one second.

2470
02:06:32,401 --> 02:06:35,100
That's my camera right in my
studio over here. All right,

2471
02:06:35,101 --> 02:06:36,990
so here's what we're going to do.
I will do a,

2472
02:06:37,050 --> 02:06:38,310
we launched a whole bunch of stuff today,

2473
02:06:38,311 --> 02:06:42,930
so I finally got Dave rubin.com after
10 or 15 years of trying to even all new

2474
02:06:42,931 --> 02:06:45,580
website, we want you
to all new Patrion, uh,

2475
02:06:45,600 --> 02:06:48,120
this morning that I want to do a live
stream and talk to you guys about,

2476
02:06:48,121 --> 02:06:51,060
because I really want to start doing
some, uh, some new community building.

2477
02:06:51,180 --> 02:06:53,910
As you can see, we have a new set, we
have new graphics, we have new music.

2478
02:06:53,911 --> 02:06:56,850
I'm sure you're all commenting
on all of those things. Uh,

2479
02:06:56,851 --> 02:07:00,540
so I'll do a live stream probably in about
an hour or two a. So we'll post that.

2480
02:07:00,600 --> 02:07:01,560
And, uh, again,

2481
02:07:01,740 --> 02:07:06,580
thanks to a Shapiro over here and we'll
set up that thing with Brooke and a,

2482
02:07:06,630 --> 02:07:09,590
what else can I pump anything else out
for you? And go check on my podcast.

2483
02:07:09,600 --> 02:07:11,850
Ben Shapiro show. Have you heard
of the Ben Shapiro show? All right.

2484
02:07:11,880 --> 02:07:12,713
Thanks for watching everybody.

2485
02:07:14,080 --> 02:07:14,500
That was great.
