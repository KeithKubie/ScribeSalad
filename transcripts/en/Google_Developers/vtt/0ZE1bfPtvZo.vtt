00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.350
[PIANO MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.350
YOTAM MANN: Hi, I'm Yotam.

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:12.792
This is an experiment
called A.I. Duet.

00:00:12.792 --> 00:00:14.250
It uses machine
learning to let you

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.915
play a duet with the computer.

00:00:15.915 --> 00:00:18.390
[PIANO MUSIC]

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.540
Making music using code
isn't a new thing at all.

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.640
But machine learning gives us
a different way to go about it.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.160
If I was trying to make A.I.
Duet with more traditional

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.740
programming, I'd have to
write out lots of rules,

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:32.310
like if someone plays a C--

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:32.810
[PLAYS C]

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:34.480
--maybe respond by
going up to a G.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.180
[PLAYS G]

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:36.770
Or if someone plays
three ascending notes--

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:37.280
[ASCENDING NOTES]

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.150
--then maybe go back down.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.760
[DESCENDING NOTES]

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.250
I'd basically be
creating this map

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.766
to tell the computer how
to make these decisions.

00:00:42.766 --> 00:00:45.140
But there are just too many
notes and timing combinations

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:46.610
to map it all by hand.

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.800
This experiment approaches
the problem differently,

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.280
using machine learning,
specifically, neural networks.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.800
We played the computer tons
of examples of melodies.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.320
Over time, it learns
these fuzzy relationships

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.260
between notes and timings
and builds its own map based

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.570
on the examples it's given.

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.618
So in this experiment,
you play a few notes.

00:01:04.618 --> 00:01:05.534
[PIANO MUSIC]

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.674
They go to the neural net,
which basically decides, based

00:01:09.674 --> 00:01:11.840
on those notes and all the
examples it's been given,

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:12.885
some possible responses.

00:01:12.885 --> 00:01:14.310
[PIANO MUSIC]

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:16.952
I had some friends try it out.

00:01:16.952 --> 00:01:19.160
It was fun to see how it
responds to different things

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.300
people play.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.590
It picks up on stuff
like key and rhythm

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.800
that you're playing, even
though I never explicitly

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.633
programmed in the concept
of key and rhythm.

00:01:26.633 --> 00:01:29.020
[PIANO MUSIC]

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.080
It was cool to see people use
it in ways I didn't expect.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.720
Instead of taking turns, a few
people played at the same time

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.250
as the neural net's
response, kind

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.780
of getting in a
creative feedback

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.190
loop with the computer.

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:42.857
It's also fun to just
mash the keyboard.

00:01:42.857 --> 00:01:44.898
The neural net tries to
return something coherent

00:01:44.898 --> 00:01:46.406
from any input that you give it.

00:01:46.406 --> 00:01:48.790
[PIANO MUSIC]

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:50.915
I made all of the
code open source.

00:01:50.915 --> 00:01:52.290
And the neural
net that I'm using

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.540
is from Google's open
source Magenta project

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.952
so anyone can grab it
and train their own net.

00:01:56.952 --> 00:01:58.410
I wanted to put
this experiment out

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:00.586
there just as an example
of the many kinds of things

00:02:00.586 --> 00:02:02.460
you can make with machine
learning and music.

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.010
And I'm really excited to
see what other people do.

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.000
