enormously just because of how
cataclysmic the consequences are with

warming a central among them I mean it's
 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.740
warming a central among them I mean it's
I think likely that we have reached or

that distant a time horizon we will
 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.459
that distant a time horizon we will
really limit the duration of our stay on

really limit the duration of our stay on
 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.860
really limit the duration of our stay on
this planet and we will limit the

other creatures to live there will be

you know after all of the ice melts and
 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.649
you know after all of the ice melts and
the and the heat changes there will be

that climb out of the muck but I think

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200
that climb out of the muck but I think
 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.950
that climb out of the muck but I think
this is deadly serious and I think that

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960
this is deadly serious and I think that
 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.899
this is deadly serious and I think that
the real problem is that it takes

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909
the real problem is that it takes
 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.940
the real problem is that it takes
enormous leadership and international

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950
enormous leadership and international
 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.700
enormous leadership and international

cooperation to achieve what needs to be
 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.700
cooperation to achieve what needs to be
achieved it takes greater self sacrifice

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710
achieved it takes greater self sacrifice
 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.109
achieved it takes greater self sacrifice
on the part of the most developed

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119
on the part of the most developed
 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.310
on the part of the most developed
nations then we are accustomed to making

nations then we are accustomed to making
 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.530
nations then we are accustomed to making
especially when it's so easy to look at

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540
especially when it's so easy to look at
 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.310
especially when it's so easy to look at
a at a rising giant like China and say

a at a rising giant like China and say
 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.620
a at a rising giant like China and say
that they're not going to make similar

that they're not going to make similar
 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.569
that they're not going to make similar
sacrifices and maybe we can't expect

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579
sacrifices and maybe we can't expect
 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.819
sacrifices and maybe we can't expect
them to because they feel they have a

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829
them to because they feel they have a
 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.069

happens in 20 generations or 30
 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.719
happens in 20 generations or 30
generations but of achieving some some

assistance to people struggling to
achieve higher levels of welfare for

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340
achieve higher levels of welfare for
 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.309
achieve higher levels of welfare for
large masses of people while at the same

and reversing the the global warming

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280
and reversing the the global warming
 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.750
and reversing the the global warming
trend i think is a an enormous challenge

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760
trend i think is a an enormous challenge
 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.199
trend i think is a an enormous challenge
one greater than any any particular

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209
one greater than any any particular
 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:28.100
one greater than any any particular
cultural trend i think a second huge

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110
cultural trend i think a second huge
 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.699
cultural trend i think a second huge
challenge is the control of weapons of

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709
challenge is the control of weapons of
 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.390
challenge is the control of weapons of
mass destruction I mean with the fall of

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400
mass destruction I mean with the fall of
 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.140
mass destruction I mean with the fall of
the Iron Curtain with the dissolution of

could be lovely but we really I think
 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:55.819
could be lovely but we really I think
paid so much less attention than we

worried about about the nuclear material
 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.990
worried about about the nuclear material
and I'm worried about it I you see a

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000
and I'm worried about it I you see a
 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.949
and I'm worried about it I you see a
documentary and on what it was like in

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049
totalitarian police state but the fact
 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:09.140
totalitarian police state but the fact
is that we would lose the fabric that

is that we would lose the fabric that
 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.939
is that we would lose the fabric that
holds us together i mean if we had the
