Hi, I'm Craig and this is Crash Course Government
and Politics. And today we're going to talk about

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.660
a fundamental concept to American government:
federalism.

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.540
Sorry. I'm not sorry. You're not even endangered
anymore.

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.989
Federalism is a little confusing because
it includes the word, "federal," as in federal

00:00:17.989 --> 00:00:21.759
government, which is what we use to describe
the government of the United States as a whole.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.140
Which is kind of the opposite of what we mean
when we say federalism. Confused? Google it.

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.660
This video will probably come up. And then just
watch this video. Or, just continue watching this video.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:38.360
[Theme Music]

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.500
So what is federalism? Most simply, it's the
idea that in the US, governmental power is

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.920
divided between the government of the United
States and the government of the individual

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.260
states. The government of the US, the national
government, is sometimes called the federal

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.710
government, while the state governments are
just called the state governments. This is

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.440
because technically the US can be considered
a federation of states. But this means different

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.860
things to different people. For instance,
federation of states means ham sandwich to

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:05.900
me. I'll have one federation of states, please,
with a side of tater tots. Thank you. I'm kind of dumb.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.470
In the federal system, the national government
takes care of some things, like for example,

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.680
war with other countries and delivering the
mail, while the state government takes care

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.300
of other things like driver's license, hunter's
licenses, barber's licences, dentist's licenses,

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:22.300
license to kill - nah, that's James Bond.
And that's in England. And I hope states don't do that.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.740
Pretty simple right? Maybe not. For one thing,
there are some aspects of government that

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.890
are handled by both the state and national
government. Taxes, American's favorite government

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.440
activity, are an example. There are federal
taxes and state taxes. But it gets even more

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.710
complicated because there are different types
of federalism depending on what period in

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:43.980
American history you're talking about. UGH!
Stan! Why is history so confusing!? UGH!

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.980
Stan, are you going to tell me? Can you talk Stan?

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.440
Basically though, there are two main types
of federalism -dual federalism, which has

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.110
nothing to do Aaron Burr, usually refers to
the period of American history that stretches

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.350
from the founding of our great nation until
the New Deal, and cooperative federalism,

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.729
which has been the rule since the 1930s. Let's
start with an easy one and start with dual

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:03.710
federalism in the Thought Bubble.

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:09.290
From 1788 until 1937, the US basically lived
under a regime of dual federalism, which meant

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:12.770
government power was strictly divided
between the state and national governments.

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.190
Notice that I didn't say separated, because
I don't want you to confuse federalism with

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.520
the separation of powers. DON'T DO IT! With
dual federalism, there are some things that

00:02:19.529 --> 00:02:22.969
only the federal government does and some
things that only the state governments do.

00:02:22.969 --> 00:02:24.540
This is sometimes called jurisdiction.

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:28.099
The national government had jurisdiction over
internal improvements like interstate roads

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:32.189
and canals, subsidies to the states, and tariffs,
which are taxes on imports and thus falls

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:36.169
under the general heading of foreign policy.
The national government also owns public lands

00:02:36.169 --> 00:02:39.819
and regulates patents which need to be national
for them to offer protection for inventors

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:42.980
in all the states. And because you want a
silver dollar in Delaware to be worth the

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.730
same as a silver dollar in Georgia, the national
government also controls currency.

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.139
The state government had control over property
laws, inheritance laws, commercial laws, banking

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:55.590
laws, corporate laws, insurance, family law,
which means marriage and divorce, morality

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.189
-- stuff like public nudeness and drinking
- which keeps me in check -- public health,

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:03.529
education, criminal laws including determining
what is a crime and how crimes are prosecuted,

00:03:03.529 --> 00:03:07.590
land use, which includes water and mineral
rights, elections, local government, and licensing

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.409
of professions and occupations, basically
what is required to drive a car, or open a

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:13.590
bar or become a barber or become James Bond.

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.489
So, under dual federalism, the state government
has jurisdiction over a lot more than the

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:21.499
national government. These powers over health,
safety and morality are sometimes called police

00:03:21.499 --> 00:03:25.189
power and usually belong to the states. Because
of the strict division between the two types

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:29.829
of government, dual federalism is sometimes
called layer cake federalism. Delicious. And

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:33.360
it's consistent with the tradition of limited
government that many Americans hold dear.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.500
Thanks Thought Bubble.

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.440
Now, some of you might be wondering, Craig,
where does the national government get the

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:40.930
power to do anything that has do to with states?
Yeah, well off the top of my head, the US

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:46.049
Constitution in Article I, Section 8 Clause
3 gives Congress the power "to regulate commerce

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:49.959
with foreign nations, and among the several
states, and with the Indian tribes." This

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:53.049
is what is known as the Commerce Clause, and
the way that it's been interpreted is the

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:55.349
basis of dual federalism and cooperative federalism.

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:58.219
For most of the 19th century, the Supreme
Court has decided that almost any attempt

00:03:58.219 --> 00:04:02.689
by any government, federal or state, to regulate
state economic activity would violate the

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:06.600
Commerce Clause. This basically meant that
there was very little regulation of business at all.

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:07.940
FREEDOOOOOOMM!

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.640
And this is how things stood, with the US following
a system of dual federalism, with very little

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.719
government regulation and the national government
not doing much other than going to war or

00:04:15.719 --> 00:04:18.690
buying and conquering enormous amounts of
territories and delivering the mail.

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.330
Then the Great Depression happened, and Franklin
Roosevelt and Congress enacted the New Deal,

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.979
which changed the role of the federal government
in a big way. The New Deal brought us cooperative

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:29.430
federalism, where the national government
encourages states and localities to pursue

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.300
nationally-defined goals. The main way that
the federal government does this is through

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:39.160
dollar-dollar bills, y'all. Money is what
I'm saying. Stan, can I make it rain? Yeah?

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:45.000
All right, I'm doing it. I happen to have cash in my
hand now. Oh yeah, take my federal money, states.

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:48.889
Regulating ya. Regulator.

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:52.840
This money that the federal government gives
to the states is called a grant-in-aid. Grants-in-aid

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:57.020
can work like a carrot encouraging a state
to adopt a certain policy or work like a stick

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.780
when the federal government withholds funds
if a state doesn't do what the national government

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.430
wants. Grants-in-aid are usually called categorical,
because they're given to states for a particular

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:08.050
purpose like transportation or education or
alleviating poverty.

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:12.009
There are 2 types of categorical grants-in-aid:
formula grants and project grants. Under a

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:16.020
formula grant, a state gets aid in a certain
amount of money based on a mathematical formula;

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:19.840
the best example of this is the old way welfare
was given in the US under the program called

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.240
Aid to Families with Dependent Children. AFDC.
States got a certain amount of money for every

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.169
person who was classified as "poor." The more
poor people a state had, the more money it

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:31.949
got. Project grants require states to submit
proposals in order to receive aid. The states

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:36.069
compete for a limited pool of resources. Nowadays,
project grants are more common than formula

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:40.360
grants, but neither is as popular as block
grants, which the government gives out Lego

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.120
Blocks and then you build stuff with Legos.
It's a good time.

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.330
No no, the national government gives a state
a huge chunk of money for something big, like

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:51.220
infrastructure, which is made with concrete
and steel, and not Legos, and the state is

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:54.569
allowed to decide how to spend the money.
The basic type of cooperative federalism is

00:05:54.569 --> 00:05:58.659
the carrot stick type which is sometimes called
marble cake federalism because it mixes up

00:05:58.659 --> 00:06:02.560
the state and federal governments in ways
that makes it impossible to separate the two.

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.639
Federalism, it's such a culinary delight.

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:08.069
The key to it is, you guessed it -- dollar
dollar bills y'all. Money. But there's another

00:06:08.069 --> 00:06:12.729
aspect of cooperative federalism that's really
not so cooperative, and that's regulated federalism.

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:17.539
Under regulated federalism, the national governments
sets up regulations and rules that the states

00:06:17.539 --> 00:06:22.060
must follow. Some examples of these rules,
also called mandates, are EPA regulations,

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:25.460
civil rights standards, and the rules set
up by the Americans with Disabilities Act.

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:28.720
Sometimes the government gives the states
money to implement the rules, but sometimes

00:06:28.729 --> 00:06:33.590
it doesn't and they must comply anyways. That's
called an unfunded mandate. Or as I like to

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:37.949
call it, an un-fun mandate. Because no money,
no fun. A good example of example of this

00:06:37.949 --> 00:06:40.629
is OSHA regulations that employers have to
follow.

00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:43.819
States don't like these, and Congress tried
to do something about them with the Unfunded

00:06:43.819 --> 00:06:48.419
Mandates Reform Act or UMRA, but it hasn't
really worked. In the early 21st century,

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:52.060
Americans are basically living under a system
of cooperative federalism with some areas

00:06:52.069 --> 00:06:56.180
of activity that are heavily regulated. This
is a stretch from the original idea that federalism

00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:00.199
will keep the national government small and
have most government functions belong to the states.

00:07:00.199 --> 00:07:03.860
If you follow American politics, and I know
you do, this small government ideal should

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:07.620
sound familiar because it's the bedrock principle
of many conservatives and libertarians in

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:12.189
the US. As conservatives made many political
inroads during the 1970s, a new concept of

00:07:12.189 --> 00:07:16.909
federalism, which was kind of an old concept
of federalism, became popular. It was called,

00:07:16.909 --> 00:07:20.930
SURPRISE, New Federalism, and it was popularized
by Presidents Nixon and Reagan.

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:24.499
Just to be clear, it's called New Federalism
not Surprise New Federalism. New Federalism

00:07:24.499 --> 00:07:28.780
basically means giving more power to the states,
and this has been done in three ways. First,

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:32.199
block grants allow states discretion to decide
what to do with federal money, and what's

00:07:32.199 --> 00:07:36.240
a better way to express your power than spending
money? Or not spending money as the case may

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:40.259
be. Another form of New Federalism is devolution,
which is the process of giving state and local

00:07:40.259 --> 00:07:44.590
governments the power to enforce regulations,
devolving power from the national to the state

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:47.560
level. Finally, some courts have picked up
the cause of New Federalism through cases

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:51.939
based on the 10th Amendment, which states
"The powers not delegated to the United States

00:07:51.939 --> 00:07:56.430
by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it
to the States, are reserved to the States

00:07:56.430 --> 00:08:01.520
respectively, or to the people." The idea that some
powers, like those police powers I talked about before,

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:05.500
are reserved by the states, have been used
to put something of a brake on the Commerce Clause.

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:10.000
So as you can see, where we are with federalism
today is kind of complicated. Presidents Reagan,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.780
George H.W. Bush, and Clinton seem to favor
New Federalism and block grants. But George

00:08:13.789 --> 00:08:18.029
W. Bush seemed to push back towards regulated
federalism with laws like No Child Left Behind

00:08:18.029 --> 00:08:21.169
and the creation of the Department of Homeland
Security. It's pretty safe to say that we're

00:08:21.169 --> 00:08:24.520
going to continue to live under a regime of
cooperative federalism, with a healthy dose

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:28.180
of regulation thrown in. But many Americans
feel that the national government is too big

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:30.240
and expensive and not what the framers wanted.

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:33.370
If history is any guide, a system of dual
federalism with most of the government in

00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:37.040
the hands of the states is probably not going
to happen. For some reason, it's really difficult

00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:41.030
to convince institutions to give up powers
once they've got them. I'm never giving up

00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:44.640
this power. Thanks for watching, I'll see
