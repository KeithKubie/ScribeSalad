00:00:32.343 --> 00:00:33.392
- [Voiceover] So let's just think about

00:00:33.392 --> 00:00:35.313
what confidence level means.

00:00:35.733 --> 00:00:37.723
That means, remember the
median's gonna be some number.

00:00:37.723 --> 00:00:39.978
It might be, you know, the
actual median hourly wage

00:00:39.978 --> 00:00:42.303
for physical therapists,
might be $30 an hour

00:00:42.303 --> 00:00:43.662
or $25 an hour.

00:00:43.662 --> 00:00:47.244
They're trying to estimate it

00:00:47.244 --> 00:00:49.701
by doing this random selection

00:00:49.701 --> 00:00:51.225
and then they're providing a range,

00:00:51.225 --> 00:00:52.019
and they're saying, "Hey,

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:53.000
"there's some confidence level

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.610
"that this range captures

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.033
"that true median hourly wage."

00:00:57.033 --> 00:00:59.927
So when they say there's
a 95% confidence level,

00:00:59.927 --> 00:01:04.213
they're saying that
there's a 95% probability

00:01:04.213 --> 00:01:07.988
that the true median is
between these two numbers.

00:01:08.778 --> 00:01:11.922
Now if we're talking about
a 90% confidence level,

00:01:11.922 --> 00:01:14.094
if we're talking about
a 90% confidence level,

00:01:14.094 --> 00:01:15.402
that means we are less confident

00:01:15.402 --> 00:01:18.335
that the true median is
between these two numbers.

00:01:18.335 --> 00:01:20.426
In order to be less confident,

00:01:20.426 --> 00:01:23.009
you would want to have
even a narrower range.

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.274
You would want a range that is a subset

00:01:25.274 --> 00:01:27.204
of this range right over here.

00:01:27.204 --> 00:01:28.171
Let me make this clear.

00:01:28.171 --> 00:01:28.944
So,

00:01:28.944 --> 00:01:32.353
the range is $22.76

00:01:32.353 --> 00:01:36.265
all the way to $59.24.

00:01:36.265 --> 00:01:39.182
So when they say it's
a 95% confidence level

00:01:39.182 --> 00:01:40.184
that means,

00:01:40.184 --> 00:01:41.957
let me actually draw a number line here.

00:01:41.957 --> 00:01:44.280
So let's say these are just
points on the number line.

00:01:45.008 --> 00:01:46.583
These are points on the number line,

00:01:46.583 --> 00:01:48.964
so that's $22.76, this is $59.24.

00:01:48.964 --> 00:01:52.259
They're 95% confident
that the true median,

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:55.174
that the true median is going to be

00:01:55.174 --> 00:01:57.545
that is going to be
between these two values.

00:01:57.545 --> 00:02:00.019
So, they're 95% confident
the true median is there,

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:01.446
that the true median is there,

00:02:01.446 --> 00:02:02.565
that the true median is there,

00:02:02.565 --> 00:02:04.617
but there's still a 5% chance

00:02:04.617 --> 00:02:06.923
that maybe the true median could be here.

00:02:06.923 --> 00:02:08.474
It could be below this range

00:02:08.474 --> 00:02:10.295
or above this range.

00:02:10.295 --> 00:02:12.724
Now, if we're talking about
a lower confidence level,

00:02:12.724 --> 00:02:14.350
90% confidence level,

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.280
that means that this range

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.018
should be narrowed.

00:02:20.018 --> 00:02:21.119
If you're gonna be less confident,

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:22.143
that means you want,

00:02:22.143 --> 00:02:24.555
or the only way you're
gonna be less confident

00:02:24.555 --> 00:02:26.938
is if you have a narrower range.

00:02:26.938 --> 00:02:29.518
If you had a broader range,

00:02:29.518 --> 00:02:31.460
if it went from say here to here,

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.264
you'd be even more confident.

00:02:33.264 --> 00:02:34.558
This type of range,

00:02:34.558 --> 00:02:37.648
you might have a 97% confidence level.

00:02:37.648 --> 00:02:39.204
So at 90% less confident,

00:02:39.204 --> 00:02:40.256
you're looking at something

00:02:40.256 --> 00:02:43.728
that might look something like that.

00:02:44.578 --> 00:02:46.080
Now, let's look at the choices.

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.571
So this is actually more like this one.

00:02:50.571 --> 00:02:51.753
You're starting lower

00:02:51.753 --> 00:02:53.077
and you're ending higher.

00:02:53.077 --> 00:02:54.246
So you should be even more...

00:02:54.246 --> 00:02:57.092
If you're 95% confidence
that this range captured it,

00:02:57.092 --> 00:02:58.196
you should be even more confident

00:02:58.196 --> 00:02:59.792
that this range captured it.

00:02:59.792 --> 00:03:02.161
So this would actually
maybe be at 97 or 98,

00:03:02.161 --> 00:03:03.398
who knows, confidence level,

00:03:03.398 --> 00:03:05.221
not a 90% confidence level,

00:03:05.221 --> 00:03:06.719
so we can rule that out.

00:03:09.744 --> 00:03:10.728
So this one's interesting

00:03:10.728 --> 00:03:12.620
because it starts lower

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.015
but then it ends lower, too.

00:03:16.725 --> 00:03:18.537
So I don't know what you could actually,

00:03:18.537 --> 00:03:21.226
what you could say,

00:03:21.226 --> 00:03:22.907
it's based on the same...

00:03:22.907 --> 00:03:24.210
Yeah, I don't know.

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:25.515
This one's a little bit...

00:03:25.515 --> 00:03:26.656
It depends kind of

00:03:26.656 --> 00:03:28.976
what the distribution
that you selected was.

00:03:28.976 --> 00:03:30.659
They didn't tell us a lot about that.

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:32.255
This is a little bit, I don't know.

00:03:32.255 --> 00:03:33.930
This one feels a little bit shady.

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:36.872
Well, this is also similar.

00:03:36.872 --> 00:03:38.546
It starts a little bit lower

00:03:38.546 --> 00:03:40.897
and then it ends a little bit lower.

00:03:40.897 --> 00:03:43.079
So, it's kind of a shift in the range

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:44.826
and so this is also...

00:03:44.826 --> 00:03:46.011
I wouldn't, you know,

00:03:46.011 --> 00:03:47.019
you don't know for sure

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:48.332
that you're going to have, I mean,

00:03:48.332 --> 00:03:49.817
you're probably going to have a...

00:03:49.817 --> 00:03:52.066
Well, they don't tell us a
lot about the distribution,

00:03:52.066 --> 00:03:54.114
so I'm not gonna make too
many statements there.

00:03:59.404 --> 00:04:01.551
So that's going to be something like...

00:04:01.551 --> 00:04:03.985
That's going to be actually like from here

00:04:04.715 --> 00:04:05.986
to here.

00:04:05.986 --> 00:04:07.776
This is going to be a narrower range,

00:04:07.776 --> 00:04:10.322
so you would be less confident.

00:04:10.322 --> 00:04:12.403
So, this could be something

00:04:12.403 --> 00:04:14.281
that represents a 90%,

00:04:14.751 --> 00:04:17.552
a 90% confidence level.

00:04:17.552 --> 00:04:18.786
So actually I would go with this one,

00:04:18.786 --> 00:04:20.027
'cause this is kind of a purely...

00:04:20.027 --> 00:04:22.590
This is a subset of the previous range

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.476
so I like this choice

00:04:24.476 --> 00:04:26.500
right over here.
