00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.710
In order to make sure that
they're getting the point here

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:06.200
let us revisit an exercise
we had come across earlier.

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.925
This is a truncated
version of the exercise.

00:00:07.925 --> 00:00:11.090
That one had six choices,
here there are only four choices.

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.160
The similarity weights are shown here.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.900
David, which one do you think is
the right choice for this problem?

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.480
&gt;&gt; So it seems to me that
given these four choices,

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.590
the right choice is
going to be number 2.

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.190
&gt;&gt; What does everyone think
about David's answer?

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.005
Did David give the right answer with 2?
