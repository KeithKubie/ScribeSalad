00:00:01.272 --> 00:00:04.939
(upbeat instrumental music)

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.770
- Welcome to A Conversation
with History, I'm Harry Kreisler

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:31.800
of the Institute of International Studies.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.370
Our guest today is John Harte,

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.550
who holds a joint professorship

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.540
in the energy and resources group

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.900
and the echo system sciences division

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.500
of the Colleges of Natural
Resources at UC Berkeley.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.810
He's authored over 150
scientific publications,

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:49.780
including six books.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.780
In 2001, he won the Leo Szilard Award

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:57.620
of the American Physical Society

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.930
and he was cited for his
diverse and incisive efforts

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.830
using physical reasoning
and analytic tools

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.360
for understanding environmental processes

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.180
and for his teaching
and writing to encourage

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.630
this approach among
students and colleagues.

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.270
John, welcome to our program.

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.103
- Thank you very much.

00:01:16.103 --> 00:01:17.610
- Where we born and raised?

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.060
- I was born in New York City,

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.850
raised in New York City in the Bronx.

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.560
I lived on one of the last
dirt roads of the Bronx

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.430
in a little house that's
now sandwiched between

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:28.790
tall apartment buildings.

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.230
- Oh my goodness and go ahead please.

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:32.690
- Oh, the house still stands

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.706
and I went back to visit
it a few years ago.

00:01:34.706 --> 00:01:36.260
- And I'm sure there was
a garden in the back?

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:37.670
- There was, we had a victory garden

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.420
during World War Two and it's still there.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.450
- And looking back, how
do you think your parents

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.020
shaped you're thinking about the world?

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.020
- Well, my parents were
both humanities teachers.

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.770
My mother taught English,
my father history

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.410
in the public high
schools in New York City

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:57.450
and they certainly imbued me

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.450
with a strong love of
literature and art and history

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.520
and I've tried to retain
as much of that as I could

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.520
and I think my mother forced
on me good writing habits.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.360
I think they gave me a very
strong sense of justice.

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.080
They were both active in
teachers unions movements

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.020
in New York City

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.470
and I think some of my more radical ideas

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.393
probably stemmed from them.

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.950
- And they sent you to summer camp

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.200
from the time you were 10 to about 16,

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.050
tell us about that 'cause
that seems to have been

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:39.370
a formative experience.

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:40.550
- It was very formative.

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.950
It was a place called Sage Hill Camp

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.390
it was in the Green
Mountains of Southern Vermont

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.500
and it was a camp with a
bunch of kids from the city

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.530
and an old man named Mr. Smith,

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.250
who was at the time in his 70s.

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.760
There were no formal counselors,

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.030
there was no regimented
structure for the day.

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.060
We built our own lean
tubes that we slept in.

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.290
We did a lot of the maintenance work

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.460
and we kind of
self-governed with Mr. Smith

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:14.850
looking out at us and reigning us in

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.830
when we got too ornery and mischievous,

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:23.830
but it was a camp that really
taught habits of independence

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:28.554
and I think that was
indeed very formative.

00:03:28.554 --> 00:03:30.670
- And you write that you learned from him

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.450
not just the names of animals and plants,

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.560
but how the pieces fit together.

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.620
- Yeah, you know, back in the 1950s

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.430
we didn't talk about systems, ecologists,

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.230
but if ever there was
one it was Mr. Smith.

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.800
He actually had been in his middle years

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.510
a forest ranger in
California and he came back

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.590
to the east coast from California

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.360
just before World War Two
and wanted to do something

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:04.050
to help kids have better
youths, help them grow up,

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.670
get out of the city, experience nature,

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:09.480
and so he bought this
chunk of land up in Vermont

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.480
and maybe from his forest
ranger experiences in the west

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.900
he understood intuitively
the principles of ecology

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:22.350
and I learned a lot from him.

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:27.740
- And you write you were impressed

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.100
and one of the things that stayed with you

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.320
was his acceptance of the chaos within us

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.810
and then you go on to speak of learning

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:42.810
the value of chaos and
continuity under his tutelage.

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:44.800
Explain that.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.800
- Well, what I did, I think
what you're reading from

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.360
was a little essay I wrote,
which was kind of an homage

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.250
to Mr. Smith and to the camp

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:01.250
and I wrote about the phenomenon
of ecological succession

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.400
and it's in that context
that that quote appeared.

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.453
After when I was about 16 the camp folded.

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:16.180
The new generation of kids
weren't interested in a camp

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:17.980
where you had to house yourself

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:20.740
and figure out how to spend your day.

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.620
They wanted more structured life,

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:24.260
they wanted to sit home in the summer

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:28.630
and watch television or
whatever and the camp folded

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:33.570
and what had been a meadow
in a clearing in the forest

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:36.010
and it originally before
he bought it as a camp

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:40.260
had been a farm, was now
reverting back to the wilderness

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:45.070
that used to be Vermont and
I went back and visited,

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:47.990
oh it was probably about 25 years ago

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:52.360
and I noticed how succession was restoring

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.890
some of the wild old-growth
forests in Vermont

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:59.000
that the original seeds
had been left there

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.610
and despite the manicured
nature of the farms

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:06.343
when they're deserted and abandoned,

00:06:08.008 --> 00:06:10.270
the real wilderness returns and with it

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:11.970
the chaos of the wilderness.

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:16.970
And so we had the return of
the chaos of old-growth forest,

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:23.350
the wildness and the jungle
like atmosphere in it,

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:26.820
but it's a continuity
because it's a recovery

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:28.440
of what used to be

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:31.420
and what I like to think
Mr. Smith understood

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:35.310
is that within each of
us, each of these kids

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:37.310
that were under his tutelage,

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:40.610
there was sort of a
yearning to be wild and free

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:45.600
and he let that come back and
a lot of that had been lost

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:49.300
in some of these kids,
but he helped it recover.

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:51.923
- Tell us a little about
your formal education.

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:55.100
Where you did your undergraduate work,

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:57.460
what your major was
and then where and what

00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:58.760
you did on your dissertation.

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:02.040
- I went from public high
school to Harvard college

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:04.990
and at Harvard I went through

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:07.270
a very strange set of transitions.

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:11.550
I went thinking I might
major in English literature

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:15.980
and very interested in creative
writing and I discovered

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:17.733
I think I took my freshman year

00:07:17.733 --> 00:07:19.600
a course with Archibald MacLeish

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:21.360
who was on the faculty,

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:25.190
and in my class were juniors and seniors

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:28.070
who were published poets and writers

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:31.590
and I just felt so outclassed by them.

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:34.340
I thought gee, maybe I'm not
as good at this as I think

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:37.440
so I ventured off into history.

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:40.440
My mother's field didn't work,
I thought I'd try my father's

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:43.950
and I realized that I had
some great history teachers.

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:47.830
I took a course from Schlessinger,
it was terrific course,

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:49.770
but again I had this feeling

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:53.410
that maybe that's not
where my real talent is

00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:56.530
and when I took math and
physics courses I did well

00:07:56.530 --> 00:08:00.420
and I realized okay, I really
do like physics, relativity,

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:03.930
and quantum mechanics are really exciting,

00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:06.210
just as exciting as Shakespeare

00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:11.210
and I ended up majoring
finally in math and physics.

00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:13.404
- And then on to Wisconsin

00:08:13.404 --> 00:08:15.290
where you did a theoretical physics--

00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:18.720
- Graduate work and got my
PhD in theoretical elementary

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:23.720
particle physics studying the
nature of subatomic particles

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:29.070
and working with various
techniques from theoretical physics

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:34.680
to understand that better
and went from there

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:38.860
on a postdoctoral
fellowship to CERN in Geneva

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:43.860
where there's a huge
atom smasher, psychotron,

00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:49.210
and studied there for a
year, wrote several papers,

00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:52.710
was able to get a postdoctoral
position at Berkeley

00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:54.790
and I spent two years at Berkeley.

00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:59.790
I worked under the
advisorship of Jeffrey Chu,

00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:02.640
who was on the physics faculty.

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:05.830
He's now retired, but a wonderful man

00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:10.490
and worked with him for two years

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:14.290
then took a faculty position at Yale

00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:18.060
and was an assistant
professor of physics at Yale

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:21.900
in the physics department,
started in 1968.

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:26.900
And my second year there I
began to get very, very upset

00:09:27.139 --> 00:09:31.060
about the Vietnam War like
a lot of my colleagues

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:34.500
and so a colleague and I, Rob Sokolow,

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:39.500
the two of us organized day
of teaching about the war,

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:44.416
not a radical protest, but
a day where we would get

00:09:44.416 --> 00:09:47.300
as many students as we
could and as many faculty

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:50.840
to cancel their classes and
we would spend the whole day

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:55.430
hearing seminars on the
Vietnam War and discussing it

00:09:55.430 --> 00:10:00.230
and it worked well, we had a huge turnout,

00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:02.783
almost all the science
classes were cancelled.

00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:07.060
And one of the people
we invited to that event

00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:11.360
was Murray Gell-Mann, the
Nobel laureate in physics

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:15.500
who was also a Yale undergraduate,

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:18.200
so he was very happy to come
back to Yale and do this.

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:23.060
Mary Goldburger, the
president of the Institute

00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:25.960
for Advanced Study was
there and the two of them

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:30.940
had been hatching a plan
to do a summer study

00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:32.217
on some environmental problem.

00:10:32.217 --> 00:10:35.910
The idea was to show
that physicists were good

00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:39.040
for more than nuclear
physics, that they were

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:41.330
maybe they could do
something and contribute

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:45.330
to this growing thing whatever it was,

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:47.470
we didn't call it an
environmental movement then,

00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:49.270
this was before the first Earth Day.

00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:54.210
The planning for this
was in the fall of '68

00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:59.210
and the event occurred
on March 4th of 1969

00:10:59.310 --> 00:11:01.790
and at the dinner that night they asked me

00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:05.670
if I'd be interested in
joining a few physicists

00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:08.850
and actually work on an
environmental problem

00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:12.120
and the problem we chose
was the Everglades.

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:14.490
And there were various
threats to the Everglades,

00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:18.320
not the least of which was
a huge jetport being planned

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:22.000
to allow the supersonics that the US

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.490
was gonna to build then
to land and take off.

00:11:24.490 --> 00:11:27.890
Florida would be the
southern terminus in the US

00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:31.680
for all the supersonic flights
to the southern hemisphere

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:33.520
and this would be a huge runway

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:38.050
you need six mile long runways
to land the supersonics

00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:43.150
so the idea would be Miami International

00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:46.090
was not big enough and so they
would build a new airstrip

00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:47.720
right in the middle of the Everglades

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:52.200
and our task was, our self-appointed
task was to figure out

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:54.150
what it would do, how much harm,

00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:55.660
and I said sure, I'll do it.

00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:58.250
I've always been an avid
birder and Everglade--

00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:00.560
- And so they knew you were
in environmental sciences

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:04.030
and you came here then to be
part of energy and resources.

00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:08.090
- That's right, I got
totally hooked by the work

00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:11.830
in the Everglades, told my
chair of the physics department

00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:13.410
at Yale that I wanted to start

00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:17.310
an environmental studies program at Yale,

00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:20.450
he said not in the physics
department you're not,

00:12:20.450 --> 00:12:23.810
so I went to Kingman Brewster
who was president of Yale,

00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:26.360
said I'd like to start
an interdisciplinary

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:27.580
environmental studies program.

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:30.730
It actually designed something
that looked a lot like ERG,

00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:33.780
and he said "well, I'll
look at it, come back

00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:35.830
and see you in a week and
I'll tell you what I think."

00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:38.027
So I come back and Brewster said

00:12:38.027 --> 00:12:43.027
"you know, at yale we solve
puzzles, not problems.

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:46.390
This isn't the right place,
the right university."

00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:47.223
- [Harry] So you came here?

00:12:47.223 --> 00:12:48.700
- [John] So I came to Berkeley.

00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:53.300
- Now this sets us up to
actually to talk a little about

00:12:54.492 --> 00:12:57.000
what are the skills involved

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.460
in being an environmental scientist

00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:02.710
and also what do you see
as the characteristics

00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:06.423
of the man or woman who
does that kind of research?

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:12.260
- Well, I'm a pluralist
about questions like that.

00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:18.430
I don't think there's any one
best set of character traits

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:22.070
or intellectual traits.

00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:25.470
I think there are a few generalities,

00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:27.630
you clearly have to love learning

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:29.800
because whatever you were trained in

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:33.480
no matter how interdisciplinary
your education was

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:36.120
you're gonna discover very quickly

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:37.580
when you confront a new problem

00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:42.120
that you need new areas of
scholarship to understand it.

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:44.490
And so one of the things
that appealed to me

00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:47.330
when I decided not to stay in physics

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:51.000
was now I had an excuse
to learn about things

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.890
like economics, which I had never studied,

00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:57.380
to learn about a whole variety of field,

00:13:57.380 --> 00:13:59.680
I had actually never
studied much chemistry

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:00.970
even though I was a physics major,

00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:02.907
didn't have to take
chemistry, I didn't like it.

00:14:02.907 --> 00:14:05.720
But I discovered when I was
looking at environmental issues

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:08.110
that you got to understand chemistry,

00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:09.950
had to learn some engineering,

00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:11.950
you had to learn a lot more biology

00:14:11.950 --> 00:14:13.453
than I had already learned.

00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:19.640
And so from the anthropology,
sociology, economic,

00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:22.730
you have to keep delving
into those fields--

00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:25.310
- So it's really interdisciplinary work,

00:14:25.310 --> 00:14:30.020
I mean you wrote a lovely
book, which I'm going to show

00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:32.030
and we're going to talk
about The Green Fuse,

00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:34.270
which is published by UC Press,

00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:37.590
but which is out of print
and which should be reissued,

00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:42.590
but you really in talking about
a number of your experiments

00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:46.300
and all over the world,
things you've worked at

00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:49.040
as an environmental
scientist, what's very clear

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:51.230
is the work is really interdisciplinary.

00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:53.810
I mean as soon as you find a problem

00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:57.010
and began working on
it, whether it's salmon

00:14:57.010 --> 00:14:59.599
or salamanders and
what's happening to them

00:14:59.599 --> 00:15:04.599
and what their nitrogen
addition or subtraction

00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:07.950
to their local environment,

00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:09.760
basically you're moving
from field to field.

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:13.793
- Yeah, in the Everglades
work I had to learn hydrology,

00:15:13.793 --> 00:15:16.990
which I had never studied, meteorology,

00:15:16.990 --> 00:15:21.130
I'm now pretty well versed
in the science of climate

00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:23.500
because I do a lot of
work on how climate change

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:26.330
affects ecosystems, but you
got to understand climate

00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:29.740
and it's even more than
just within the sciences.

00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:32.550
Soon as I get out into
the world of policy,

00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:36.027
which I like to do, I've
had to learn a lot about law

00:15:36.027 --> 00:15:41.027
and economics, so being
being a perpetual student

00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:43.490
is probably the most important thing.

00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:46.160
- And patience was another
thing that I picked up.

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:49.000
Your salamander experiments
went on for 10 years right?

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.123
- Yeah, that's right.

00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:54.000
Things don't happen
fast and if you look at

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.410
only over a year or two you can often see

00:15:57.410 --> 00:15:59.530
what you think is a trend or a pattern

00:15:59.530 --> 00:16:01.750
and it turns out to be a little blip

00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:06.050
in an otherwise very different
long-term trend pattern.

00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:09.560
- Now there's a very
interesting interaction,

00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:11.854
which is in your discussion

00:16:11.854 --> 00:16:14.600
of how an environmental scientist works.

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:19.600
It's often in very local
areas in defined spaces,

00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:25.030
but as you unravel whatever
mystery it is you're looking at

00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:28.520
you have to stretch the horizon,

00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:30.860
so in looking at your career

00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:35.860
as conveyed in this journal of
your odyssey The Green Fuse,

00:16:36.778 --> 00:16:40.080
you really are moving all over the globe.

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:42.040
You're starting in a locale,

00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:44.780
but you're always coming
up against the extent

00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:49.500
to which the problems, that
is the damage being done,

00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:52.220
are really kind of global
or at least regional issues.

00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:55.500
- The thing I most emphasize
with my graduate students

00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:58.500
when they start thinking
about their searchable topic

00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:00.880
is what's the boundary?

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:03.450
And very often the instinct

00:17:03.450 --> 00:17:05.313
is to draw boundaries too tightly.

00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:08.740
One has to draw them broadly enough

00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:11.570
to encompass everything that's important,

00:17:11.570 --> 00:17:15.010
but not too broadly so
that you get mired down

00:17:15.010 --> 00:17:18.560
in extraneous detail and the
art of drawing boundaries

00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:23.560
around research problems is
something that very few people

00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:29.520
just are born understanding,
you have to develop

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:32.510
better and better instincts
for doing that through practice

00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:34.980
and I spend a lot of time with my students

00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:37.140
on exactly that issue.

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:42.140
- Now when you wrote, when
you won the Szilard award

00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:48.740
you gave a talk comparing
the differences between

00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:50.090
being a physical scientist

00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:52.030
and being an environmental scientist

00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:55.070
and we've already just
learned that you've seen life

00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:59.380
from both sides now, so let's
talk about that comparison

00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:02.840
a little, you know, what's
kind of the difference,

00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:04.510
what's the nature of the work,

00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:06.270
and what do you conclude
about the difference?

00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:10.053
- Yeah, there are two broad
traditions in science,

00:18:10.053 --> 00:18:13.020
what I call the Newtonian
and the Darwinian

00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:14.823
and they are very different.

00:18:16.810 --> 00:18:18.983
Let's start with the Newtonian.

00:18:18.983 --> 00:18:23.983
The goal of physics is to
simplify, simplify, simplify,

00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:28.640
to find the simple general
law that describes everything

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:32.790
in the universe from
atoms to galactic clusters

00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:40.680
and physics has had a
remarkable success record

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:43.810
in doing that and when you start looking

00:18:43.810 --> 00:18:48.120
at very fine details they get in the way

00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:50.430
of the physicist's goal.

00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:55.170
For example, Galileo, who went
up, at least the story goes,

00:18:55.170 --> 00:18:58.740
climbed the Leaning Tower
and dropped a heavy object

00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:02.730
and a light object down, noted
they fell at the same speed

00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:05.300
and discovered the law of inertia that way

00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:10.300
and set the stage for all of
Newtonian and modern physics.

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:13.890
Now actually, if that were an ecologist

00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:14.840
doing that experiment

00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:16.497
he would have noted that the heavy thing

00:19:16.497 --> 00:19:20.150
and the light thing fell at
slightly different speeds

00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:22.630
because air resistance will be different.

00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:27.530
And the ecological worldview
is to be fascinated

00:19:27.530 --> 00:19:29.540
by the differences between things.

00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:33.720
If I'm studying this
type of frog for 30 years

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:35.410
and that's my life's work,

00:19:35.410 --> 00:19:38.313
it's what's different about
that frog that's important,

00:19:39.370 --> 00:19:42.410
not what it has in common
with everything else

00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:46.700
in the living universe because
if all of it's properties

00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:48.430
were in common with everything else,

00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:49.803
why bother studying it?

00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:55.157
So uniqueness and particularity
characterize ecology

00:19:56.260 --> 00:20:01.260
or Darwinian science and
generality and universality

00:20:01.610 --> 00:20:03.380
describe Newtonian science.

00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:05.010
And what I argued in that essay

00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:09.360
is that environmental
issues require a synthesis

00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:14.360
of those two worldviews, that
they're not incompatible,

00:20:14.490 --> 00:20:17.480
they're not dichotomous, but they reflect

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:21.670
different historical patterns
in the history of science

00:20:21.670 --> 00:20:25.070
and that most every really interesting

00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:27.810
and important environmental problem,

00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:31.300
at least that I've ever
encountered, can't be understood

00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:32.740
just from the Newtonian

00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:35.710
or just from the Darwinian perspective.

00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:37.980
We have to put them together

00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:40.388
and I gave some examples in that article.

00:20:40.388 --> 00:20:43.570
- And so when you have a student

00:20:43.570 --> 00:20:45.170
who has a particular problem

00:20:45.170 --> 00:20:46.623
and you're working with them,

00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:52.673
you use in this book
examples of the salmon,

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:55.950
which requires you to go to Alaska,

00:20:55.950 --> 00:21:00.950
and the salamander, I
believe in The Rockies right?

00:21:01.910 --> 00:21:05.650
Yeah, so you have to be ready to pack up

00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:07.980
with your backpack in your field.

00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:09.253
But that aside,

00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:15.250
the problem requires
you to unravel a story

00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:18.720
which sort of broadens the horizons

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:22.160
and there's an awful lot
of ambiguity basically

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:25.410
about what is causing
the particular problem

00:21:25.410 --> 00:21:28.950
and I think at one
point you say in science

00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:31.230
you ask a question and
then the second question

00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:33.185
automatically is why are you asking that?

00:21:33.185 --> 00:21:35.150
- Yeah, yeah, often,

00:21:35.150 --> 00:21:40.150
because if you happen to
like salamanders like I do

00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:43.440
it's very natural to ask why
is the population declining?

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:46.190
But the real question has to do

00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:49.120
with the broader forces at work.

00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:53.320
And for example, we were
documenting how acid rain

00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:58.320
was beginning to eradicate
a very unusual population

00:21:58.550 --> 00:22:02.700
of salamanders, a
population that was unusual

00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:05.210
and whose habitat would had been protected

00:22:05.210 --> 00:22:06.900
by the Nature Conservancy

00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:10.000
because of this unique
feature of this population--

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.380
- Which is that they didn't go--

00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:12.442
- Metamorphose--

00:22:12.442 --> 00:22:13.275
- Yeah, right.

00:22:13.275 --> 00:22:16.100
- And so they're stuck in these lakes

00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:18.230
and the lakes get acidic
they're in trouble.

00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:23.230
And the interesting thing
is that around that time,

00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:27.070
this was in the, we started around 1981

00:22:27.070 --> 00:22:29.500
and it was around the time
that I became convinced

00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:31.730
that global warming was a real problem,

00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:36.660
but I put that worry aside and
I focused on acid deposition.

00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:40.470
But then I realized that there's
an even bigger issue here,

00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:42.170
which is that under global warming

00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:45.250
those ponds won't even exist

00:22:45.250 --> 00:22:50.250
even if we reduced acid rain
as we did to a huge extent

00:22:50.590 --> 00:22:52.810
with the 1990 Clean Air Act amendments

00:22:52.810 --> 00:22:57.330
that applied to western
coal fired power plants.

00:22:57.330 --> 00:23:00.210
We cleaned up the rain to a major extent

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:04.070
in that part of of the United States,

00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:07.120
but the threat now is an even bigger one,

00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:10.680
which is that their entire
habitat is going to disappear

00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:13.630
because these ponds will
evaporate to dryness

00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:16.890
before the summer ends and so creatures

00:23:16.890 --> 00:23:20.110
like these salamanders
that can't metamorphose

00:23:20.110 --> 00:23:24.300
'cause they're perpetually
in the larval stage

00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:25.830
even when they reproduce,

00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:27.990
that they're not going
to have any habitat left

00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:31.850
and so the questions
keep, like Chinese boxes,

00:23:31.850 --> 00:23:34.510
getting bigger and instead
of going into the box

00:23:34.510 --> 00:23:37.610
you're going up to
bigger and bigger boxes.

00:23:37.610 --> 00:23:40.070
- And these...

00:23:42.150 --> 00:23:44.250
Creatures, is that the appropriate word?

00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:49.250
The salamanders in this
case, they're very delicate

00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:53.173
and so therefore they are
what you call a green fuse,

00:23:55.123 --> 00:23:59.560
a fuse in nature that sounds an alert,

00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:03.330
you know, what's happening in the world

00:24:03.330 --> 00:24:08.330
and that is very important,
so it's local complexity

00:24:10.650 --> 00:24:12.850
leading to a wider and wider circle,

00:24:12.850 --> 00:24:15.080
which then moves you into big issues.

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:18.400
- Some people they prefer
the image of the canary

00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:21.090
in the mine, but my problem
with the canary image

00:24:21.090 --> 00:24:24.020
is when the canary keeled over

00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:25.670
the miners would run out of the mine,

00:24:25.670 --> 00:24:27.500
but we have no place to run.

00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:32.500
We don't have a place to
run to escape the problem

00:24:32.707 --> 00:24:35.100
and we have to change the system,

00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:40.090
so if the fuse blows, that
there's a systemic problem

00:24:40.090 --> 00:24:43.470
that has to be confronted,
that's why I use that image.

00:24:43.470 --> 00:24:45.670
And the other thing is that
there are three meanings

00:24:45.670 --> 00:24:49.300
of the word fuse and the
book uses all three of them.

00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:50.660
- And those three meanings are?

00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:55.660
- Well, there's the fuses in
something that leads to a bomb,

00:24:56.590 --> 00:24:58.530
you light the fuse, it ticks away

00:24:58.530 --> 00:25:01.780
and this is what the
situation with climate,

00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:06.410
we're in for an explosively
catastrophic climate

00:25:06.410 --> 00:25:09.830
if we don't do anything,
the climate bomb is ticking.

00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:14.433
Fuse as in to cohere, to
unite, to put together

00:25:16.030 --> 00:25:20.420
and that's where these connections I show

00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:24.820
between what's going
on in the Arctic lakes

00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:26.310
and what's going on in The Rockies

00:25:26.310 --> 00:25:28.200
and what's going on in the Everglades,

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:30.260
that their commonalities,

00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:33.100
the threads that tie these places together

00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:36.090
and interactions between them.

00:25:36.090 --> 00:25:38.850
Teleconnections is a word,
I don't like the word,

00:25:38.850 --> 00:25:42.773
but that's a word that
climatologists use to describe this.

00:25:45.620 --> 00:25:49.240
If you look at a traditional
nature show on television

00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:54.240
this week it's on, you
know, the Brazilian Amazon,

00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:57.930
next week it might be
on the Canadian Rockies,

00:25:57.930 --> 00:26:02.930
the week after it might
be on the Mediterranean

00:26:03.130 --> 00:26:04.980
and each week it's a different place

00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:07.540
and you don't learn from those shows

00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:08.800
the connections between them.

00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:10.240
And what I tried to do in that book

00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:12.530
was show the interconnectedness

00:26:12.530 --> 00:26:14.150
and so fuse in that sense,

00:26:14.150 --> 00:26:17.410
and then finally fuse
in a sense of something

00:26:17.410 --> 00:26:20.660
that blows when you've
overloaded the system

00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:22.080
and we have overloaded the Earth

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:24.524
and the fuses are starting to pop.

00:26:24.524 --> 00:26:28.070
- And it's interesting because
I think it's interesting

00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:29.960
at this point to raise the question

00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:33.190
of where does creativity come from.

00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:35.940
Is it in the midst of this complexity

00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:39.590
and the realization is hey,
this answer isn't adequate

00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:40.980
because there's a larger picture

00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:43.920
or is it imagining
something that isn't there

00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:46.950
you say at one point and
wondering why it isn't there?

00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:50.320
I think with cypress trees
in the ocean or something.

00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:53.120
- Well, there were a couple
of examples, that one was...

00:26:57.202 --> 00:26:58.560
I'm trying to think if it was Cypress,

00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:00.620
I don't remember the Cypress tree example,

00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:05.620
but the creativity comes
from both the sort of

00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:07.460
bottom up and the top down.

00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:11.620
From the top down it comes
from trying to understand

00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:16.360
how to develop ecological
theory that can have

00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:23.680
the generality of physics and
the specificity of biology.

00:27:28.130 --> 00:27:30.140
There's a tension between those,

00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:34.560
that's the issue of unifying
two very different strands

00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:39.090
of science history and putting together

00:27:39.090 --> 00:27:41.590
new approaches that do that.

00:27:41.590 --> 00:27:43.647
This calls for a lot of very creative work

00:27:43.647 --> 00:27:45.970
and with my students I think we've made

00:27:45.970 --> 00:27:47.500
at least some progress in that.

00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:51.230
Then the other source
is the bottom-up source

00:27:51.230 --> 00:27:53.500
where you're seeing puzzles in the world.

00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:54.510
You're seeing things

00:27:54.510 --> 00:27:56.880
that should have been there and weren't.

00:27:57.850 --> 00:28:02.850
You're seeing, you know,
the nitrogen levels

00:28:03.770 --> 00:28:05.970
behaving in a certain way in Arctic lakes

00:28:05.970 --> 00:28:07.610
and then you start to wonder

00:28:07.610 --> 00:28:10.020
are the salmon returning from the sea

00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:14.050
maintaining these nitrogen supplies

00:28:14.050 --> 00:28:17.007
or if it's coming from the alder trees

00:28:17.007 --> 00:28:19.590
and the nitrogen-fixing lichen

00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:22.210
on the slopes above these Arctic lakes,

00:28:22.210 --> 00:28:25.260
will that be impacted by air pollution?

00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:28.966
And so you're asking the
technical detailed questions

00:28:28.966 --> 00:28:33.966
and then trying to come up
with answers to these puzzles.

00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:36.360
It's like detective work.

00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:40.480
- And you focus in your
work on three things,

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:43.080
climate change, diversity,

00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:47.180
and then sustainable
ecology basically right?

00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:51.180
And how have those interests
emerged on your part?

00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:54.470
Is it a result of where
the whole field was moving

00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:57.980
or do you bump up against those problems

00:28:57.980 --> 00:29:01.710
in the different local
environments that you've worked in?

00:29:01.710 --> 00:29:06.120
- Well, I let me say that
it would not surprise me

00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:08.760
or my colleagues if 10 years from now

00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:11.900
I'm doing something different
because if I look back

00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:16.900
at how I spent the 1970s
and the 80s and the 1990s

00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:20.640
and the last nine years,
been doing different things.

00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:23.523
In the 70s when I first came to Berkeley,

00:29:24.590 --> 00:29:28.610
I was working on what's
called ecotoxicology,

00:29:28.610 --> 00:29:33.370
which is how do toxic
substances affect aquatic life

00:29:33.370 --> 00:29:35.720
and ultimately how would
it affect human life?

00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:39.130
And I had grants from the
Environmental Protection Agency

00:29:39.130 --> 00:29:42.370
to develop better methods for testing

00:29:42.370 --> 00:29:46.713
how aquatic ecosystems would
be responding to acid rain,

00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:49.880
I'm sorry, to pollution,
and one of the pollutants

00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:54.070
I looked at was acidity, that
got me interested in acid rain

00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:56.870
and I realized I couldn't
keep studying that in the lab

00:29:56.870 --> 00:29:59.870
I had to get out and look
at real lakes and streams

00:29:59.870 --> 00:30:04.570
and real ecosystems and so I
began 10 years of field work

00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:09.330
on acid deposition and how it affects life

00:30:09.330 --> 00:30:11.210
and I was working up in The Rockies,

00:30:11.210 --> 00:30:13.740
that was a very good
place to do this work.

00:30:13.740 --> 00:30:16.490
But then I realized
toward the end of the 80s

00:30:16.490 --> 00:30:17.880
as I mentioned earlier,

00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:20.410
that gee, you could solve
the acid rain problem

00:30:20.410 --> 00:30:23.440
and climate change would still
wipe these creatures out.

00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:26.910
That got me interested
in climate and I ended up

00:30:26.910 --> 00:30:31.120
doing a lot of work on how
it affects plant communities,

00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:35.350
terrestrial ecosystems,
forests, and meadows

00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:37.660
and spent a lot of time on that.

00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:42.660
That got me interested in how
ecosystems influence climate.

00:30:42.730 --> 00:30:46.080
It's a two-way street,
climate influences ecosystems

00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:48.940
but as you change ecosystems
that can alter climate,

00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:51.690
that's called feedback,
and I began studying

00:30:51.690 --> 00:30:56.480
the feedback effects by
which ecological changes,

00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:59.470
whether or not they're brought
about by climate change

00:30:59.470 --> 00:31:03.320
will affect climate, and
so lately I've been doing

00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:04.920
a lot of work in that area

00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:08.560
and then also in the biodiversity area.

00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:10.590
I've been interested in trying to develop

00:31:10.590 --> 00:31:13.640
fundamental ecological
theory that will help us

00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:17.090
better understand
patterns in the abundance

00:31:17.090 --> 00:31:19.500
and distribution of species.

00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:20.333
- Now...

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:27.310
As we saw in the early
parts of your career,

00:31:27.310 --> 00:31:30.970
science was bumping up
against public policy

00:31:30.970 --> 00:31:34.380
in the sense that
scientists were concerned

00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:38.130
about the Vietnam War and
then later the nuclear buildup

00:31:38.130 --> 00:31:39.970
in the nuclear arms race.

00:31:39.970 --> 00:31:43.010
And then when you start your work

00:31:43.010 --> 00:31:44.560
you're in the Everglades

00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:46.750
and then you're bumping up again

00:31:46.750 --> 00:31:48.820
the building of a new airport

00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:51.000
and this leads you to an analysis

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:56.000
of what makes the Everglades tick.

00:31:57.787 --> 00:32:02.787
And one has to then
come to the realization

00:32:03.630 --> 00:32:08.630
that the Everglades are
very dependent on swamps

00:32:08.650 --> 00:32:13.650
and on this phenomena of
moral, which you could explain,

00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:16.890
but, so then how do you
get into the policy?

00:32:16.890 --> 00:32:19.360
What is the responsibility
of the scientist?

00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:22.810
- We went to Florida, we
began the study thinking

00:32:22.810 --> 00:32:26.450
we can show that this
huge planned development

00:32:26.450 --> 00:32:31.440
in the Everglades was going
to harm the alligators

00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:34.580
and the wood storks and all
of the wonderful creatures

00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:36.880
in the Everglades, that
would be reason enough

00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:39.220
to convince the public to stop it.

00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:40.830
Well, halfway through that study

00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:43.830
I realize that's not
going to do the trick,

00:32:43.830 --> 00:32:48.010
that there is such huge economic forces

00:32:48.010 --> 00:32:52.207
behind this push to build
the supersonics airport there

00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:56.100
that we had to come up with something more

00:32:56.100 --> 00:32:57.560
and I didn't know if we could.

00:32:57.560 --> 00:33:01.810
But I began thinking about
the hydrology of South Florida

00:33:01.810 --> 00:33:06.810
and alligators and wood storks
aside, draining the swamps,

00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:10.740
even if it didn't harm creatures,
which of course it would,

00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:13.490
but even if it didn't,
it was going to destroy

00:33:13.490 --> 00:33:17.830
the water supply of half a
million people in South Florida,

00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:20.230
not because they're drinking swamp water,

00:33:20.230 --> 00:33:22.150
they're drinking well water,

00:33:22.150 --> 00:33:24.730
but what's keeping that well water fresh

00:33:24.730 --> 00:33:26.650
and not sea line?

00:33:26.650 --> 00:33:29.050
It's the swamp water that sits above it

00:33:29.050 --> 00:33:31.850
and you drain the swamps and the sea water

00:33:31.850 --> 00:33:33.430
comes into the wells.

00:33:33.430 --> 00:33:35.950
And we showed that, we demonstrated it

00:33:35.950 --> 00:33:37.280
with physical principles.

00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:40.540
We put together maps of the aquifer system

00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:44.450
and were able to show that
there was a threat looming here

00:33:44.450 --> 00:33:48.100
to about half a million people
living along the Gulf Coast

00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:51.560
of southern Florida and
that was the argument

00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:53.780
that caused them to cancel the plan

00:33:53.780 --> 00:33:55.630
to put the airport there.

00:33:55.630 --> 00:33:59.100
Now later it turned out that
we never built the supersonics

00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:02.470
and the need for that airport dissolved

00:34:02.470 --> 00:34:04.860
and instead when they
had to build more runways

00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:08.120
and expand airports they just
expanded Miami International.

00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:13.120
But at the time, it was that
argument about water supply

00:34:13.290 --> 00:34:17.040
to people that ultimately did the trick

00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:20.070
and so one of the things
I've learned over the years

00:34:20.070 --> 00:34:25.070
is that I love nature,
plants, birds, everything,

00:34:25.240 --> 00:34:28.260
but to really make an argument

00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:30.650
that will persuade policymakers,

00:34:30.650 --> 00:34:35.650
you often have to extend
the analysis and show

00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:40.820
how real immediate material
human needs won't be met

00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:46.140
when you go ahead and, you
know, destroy something

00:34:46.140 --> 00:34:47.890
as beautiful as the Everglades.

00:34:47.890 --> 00:34:51.440
- And you have a very strong
sense that the scientist

00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:56.440
has a responsibility not
to abuse his own evidence

00:34:57.070 --> 00:35:01.590
because he's compelled by
making the political point

00:35:01.590 --> 00:35:04.040
which is the right thing he thinks to do

00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:05.210
and how do you do that?

00:35:05.210 --> 00:35:10.210
I mean where does that
scrupulousness come from

00:35:11.537 --> 00:35:15.113
and what have you learned
from employing it?

00:35:16.250 --> 00:35:20.500
- I think it comes from,
and maybe this is where

00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:24.880
the sense of history that I
got from my father comes in,

00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:29.300
that important as the thing
you're currently working on

00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:33.470
may seem, it's not the
most important thing.

00:35:33.470 --> 00:35:38.050
The problems we're going to
face 20, 30, 40 years from now

00:35:38.050 --> 00:35:41.470
could be much more important
than they are today.

00:35:41.470 --> 00:35:46.470
And if I go all out and
twist and distort the science

00:35:46.530 --> 00:35:50.560
in order to get the public to do something

00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:55.560
about a current problem,
I may sufficiently destroy

00:35:56.792 --> 00:36:00.660
the reputation of science
or at least my reputation,

00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:02.840
but it actually undermines all of science

00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:06.020
when people do this and
makes it more difficult

00:36:06.020 --> 00:36:11.020
for my young students
coming out now in 20 years

00:36:11.130 --> 00:36:14.210
to attack the problems
they're gonna confront,

00:36:14.210 --> 00:36:16.880
so it's this feeling that we're always

00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:18.670
going to have problems

00:36:18.670 --> 00:36:21.800
and we can't pull the rug
out from under the future

00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:23.480
by distorting the present.

00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:27.310
We have to be as honest
and careful as we can today

00:36:27.310 --> 00:36:30.110
in order to protect the
institution of science

00:36:30.110 --> 00:36:33.757
because we're going to need
that institution in the future.

00:36:33.757 --> 00:36:38.600
- Now this raises an interesting point

00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:43.600
which is what exactly are
your philosophical assumptions

00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:48.240
beyond just your
assumptions as a scientist

00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:49.520
about how you work?

00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:53.130
And one thing that's very important

00:36:53.130 --> 00:36:58.130
is factoring in the consequences
for future generations.

00:36:58.530 --> 00:37:02.320
Talk about that because
that's really central

00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:05.570
to what you just said,
which is not undermining

00:37:05.570 --> 00:37:08.680
the reputation of science in the future.

00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:12.060
- Well, maybe coming from
mathematics and physics

00:37:12.060 --> 00:37:17.060
I have this appreciation
for the logic of something

00:37:19.370 --> 00:37:21.840
like the categorical imperative,

00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:24.940
the Kantian ethical principle

00:37:24.940 --> 00:37:29.303
is based on a kind of irrefutable logic,

00:37:31.030 --> 00:37:32.450
but it's missing something.

00:37:32.450 --> 00:37:35.230
And what it's missing
is something I realized

00:37:35.230 --> 00:37:39.990
and probably stems from some
philosophical belief system

00:37:39.990 --> 00:37:41.140
I have, although I'm not sure

00:37:41.140 --> 00:37:43.120
I could characterize it real well,

00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:48.120
but it's that, two
things: the future is...

00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:54.240
It's just as important as the president.

00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:56.670
There's a wonderful statement
that summarizes this

00:37:56.670 --> 00:37:58.770
I didn't think of this,
but it's a lovely phrase

00:37:58.770 --> 00:38:00.870
I quoted in the book.

00:38:00.870 --> 00:38:05.870
Herman Daly, the economist,
who has fought this notion

00:38:06.910 --> 00:38:09.240
that if an economy doesn't grow it dies.

00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:11.950
He's really the parent of the concept

00:38:11.950 --> 00:38:13.750
of a steady-state economy.

00:38:13.750 --> 00:38:18.730
He once had to write a
review of a just awful book

00:38:18.730 --> 00:38:22.610
by Julian Simon that was another economist

00:38:22.610 --> 00:38:25.480
who believed that there
were no limits to growth

00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:28.670
and Simon wrote we should
try to have as many people

00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:30.103
on this planet as we can.

00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:33.030
People are good so let's have more of them

00:38:33.030 --> 00:38:36.160
and Daly writing a
review of the book said,

00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:40.590
he began the review in a
way that startled many of us

00:38:40.590 --> 00:38:42.667
when we read it he began by saying

00:38:42.667 --> 00:38:44.610
"Yes, I agree with Simon,

00:38:44.610 --> 00:38:48.440
we should have as many people
on this planet as possible,

00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:50.690
but not all at the same time."

00:38:50.690 --> 00:38:52.683
And it's a beautiful statement.

00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:56.940
Let's keep the enterprise
going for as long as possible

00:38:56.940 --> 00:39:01.940
rather than try to puff it
up as much as we can today.

00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:07.840
And that I think is, or lard
it up as much as we can today,

00:39:10.462 --> 00:39:13.880
that reflects a philosophical
view that I share

00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:16.950
and so in extending the Kantian imperative

00:39:16.950 --> 00:39:20.280
to future generations,
which is what I talk about

00:39:21.570 --> 00:39:25.330
in the epilogue in the
book, I'm reflecting,

00:39:25.330 --> 00:39:28.020
I think something that I feel ready,

00:39:28.020 --> 00:39:30.810
but I have no idea why I think
it or where it came from,

00:39:30.810 --> 00:39:33.610
but the other thing I feel very strongly,

00:39:33.610 --> 00:39:37.970
and again this in a way started
coming into consciousness

00:39:37.970 --> 00:39:39.620
with the Everglades study,

00:39:39.620 --> 00:39:42.140
is that there's been a progression

00:39:42.140 --> 00:39:45.160
and long ago people used to say

00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:50.160
man is the steward of nature and that idea

00:39:52.380 --> 00:39:56.470
is considered in advance over the notion

00:39:56.470 --> 00:39:59.980
that man is the ruler of nature

00:39:59.980 --> 00:40:02.270
that we should be more like a shepherd

00:40:02.270 --> 00:40:07.210
with his flock than
like a vindictive ruler.

00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:10.870
But, I don't think that goes far enough

00:40:10.870 --> 00:40:13.760
the idea of man is the steward of nature.

00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:17.510
I really believe nature
is the steward of us

00:40:17.510 --> 00:40:18.480
and that...

00:40:21.990 --> 00:40:25.120
The human economy is a
wholly owned subsidiary

00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:27.960
of natural ecosystems.

00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:30.900
Without the ecosystem
services they provide

00:40:30.900 --> 00:40:33.750
the whole human enterprise is over

00:40:33.750 --> 00:40:37.200
and so I feel very strongly
that we should view

00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:40.950
our relationship to nature that way

00:40:40.950 --> 00:40:44.050
rather than as we are somehow
governing and stewarding.

00:40:44.050 --> 00:40:47.840
- And one of the mistakes
we make you write

00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:52.840
is not recognizing that nature
requires restraint from us.

00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:57.810
If the human impulse is to dam the rivers,

00:40:57.810 --> 00:40:59.950
hack the forests, blast out the mountains,

00:40:59.950 --> 00:41:02.090
and scour the rivers for metal ores,

00:41:02.090 --> 00:41:04.900
drain the wetlands, and
pollute the rain and snow

00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:07.210
is given free reign in
the western mountains,

00:41:07.210 --> 00:41:09.240
then our children and
all future generations

00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:12.850
will not be blessed with
these gifts of nature.

00:41:12.850 --> 00:41:15.730
That's a real redefinition isn't it

00:41:15.730 --> 00:41:17.720
that we're going to have to adjust to?

00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:22.720
- Yeah, I think when we
talk about conservation

00:41:25.570 --> 00:41:28.590
I think what we really
have to pull back on

00:41:28.590 --> 00:41:31.990
is our urge to do everything
we know how to do.

00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:34.090
There are many things
we could do if we wanted

00:41:34.090 --> 00:41:37.770
and we have to restrain those urges.

00:41:37.770 --> 00:41:42.500
- Now what is the implication of this

00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:46.610
for our commitment to capitalism?

00:41:46.610 --> 00:41:51.610
Because recently Gus
Speth was on our program

00:41:52.450 --> 00:41:55.320
from Yale and he was arguing in that book

00:41:55.320 --> 00:41:58.580
after a whole career in
the environmental movement,

00:41:58.580 --> 00:42:01.180
he had come to realize both in government

00:42:01.180 --> 00:42:04.490
and outside of government that capitalism

00:42:04.490 --> 00:42:05.690
was part of the problem.

00:42:06.770 --> 00:42:11.770
- Well, fortunately we've
never really tried capitalism.

00:42:12.930 --> 00:42:16.920
We have some modified
sort of Mongrel system

00:42:17.770 --> 00:42:22.260
with some elements of
capitalism and fortunately,

00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:26.320
many elements of regulation and control.

00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:28.490
We've seen in the current economic crisis

00:42:28.490 --> 00:42:30.820
that our controls and regulations

00:42:30.820 --> 00:42:34.203
aren't always adequate, strong enough.

00:42:35.430 --> 00:42:39.800
Pure unadulterated capitalism
would be an absolute disaster.

00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:42.890
Fortunately, I don't know
of any modern society

00:42:42.890 --> 00:42:47.130
that's ever tried it, but it
would be an utter disaster

00:42:47.130 --> 00:42:49.500
and the people who would hate it the most

00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:52.163
would be the CEOs of major companies.

00:42:53.020 --> 00:42:55.090
Think where the oil industry would be

00:42:55.090 --> 00:42:57.970
without the subsidies and the regulations

00:42:57.970 --> 00:43:01.300
and the military apparatus
that makes possible

00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:04.470
what they do overseas.

00:43:04.470 --> 00:43:08.690
So no, we don't have
capitalism thank goodness.

00:43:08.690 --> 00:43:11.200
What I believe is that we need

00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:15.167
a more well-regulated economy

00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:20.050
with more government regulation,

00:43:20.050 --> 00:43:24.740
particularly to protect us from things

00:43:24.740 --> 00:43:29.300
like inefficient and
excess use of fossil fuels

00:43:29.300 --> 00:43:33.690
when we could be at actually
at an economic advantage

00:43:33.690 --> 00:43:38.520
to ourselves be replacing
fossil fuels with renewables

00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:41.603
and particularly with
more energy efficiency.

00:43:42.670 --> 00:43:47.670
- It would seem that one
of the things obviously

00:43:49.100 --> 00:43:52.560
strangely and ironically
the economic collapse

00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:55.240
becomes an opportunity to reconsider

00:43:56.968 --> 00:44:00.220
the way we do things in
our relation to capitalism

00:44:00.220 --> 00:44:03.580
our relationship to nature,

00:44:03.580 --> 00:44:06.680
but I'm curious with your long experience

00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:10.220
you've been in, you've
contributed to law journals,

00:44:10.220 --> 00:44:12.660
you've worked on issues of land use

00:44:12.660 --> 00:44:16.264
and it's obviously very complicated

00:44:16.264 --> 00:44:19.060
how you resolve some of the dilemmas.

00:44:19.060 --> 00:44:22.050
I'm curious it would seem

00:44:22.050 --> 00:44:24.840
that there's an important
role for political education

00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:29.430
for educating people about the science

00:44:29.430 --> 00:44:33.230
as a path to educating them
about the social choices

00:44:33.230 --> 00:44:34.063
we have to make.

00:44:34.063 --> 00:44:35.120
- That's exactly right.

00:44:36.750 --> 00:44:39.560
One of the things I enjoyed teaching

00:44:39.560 --> 00:44:43.740
a class I taught this fall
during the the worsening

00:44:43.740 --> 00:44:47.330
of the economic situation
was how we can look

00:44:47.330 --> 00:44:51.030
at the human economy the way an ecologist

00:44:51.030 --> 00:44:53.610
looks at the feedbacks in an ecosystem.

00:44:53.610 --> 00:44:57.020
And within our economic
system, we've rigged it

00:44:57.020 --> 00:45:00.720
so that there are these
positive cascading feedbacks,

00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:02.470
not positive in that they're good for us,

00:45:02.470 --> 00:45:05.180
positive in that they're amplifying,

00:45:05.180 --> 00:45:07.610
and so something starts to go wrong

00:45:07.610 --> 00:45:11.180
that triggers a response that
triggers a counter response

00:45:11.180 --> 00:45:14.760
and then the end result
is that you've exacerbated

00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:19.760
the original triggering causes
and made the situation worse.

00:45:19.850 --> 00:45:24.240
And so we descend, so we
spiral down into true recession

00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:25.990
which is where I think we are now

00:45:25.990 --> 00:45:30.300
and I think political
scientists need to hear

00:45:30.300 --> 00:45:33.220
how ecologists view these problems

00:45:33.220 --> 00:45:37.520
and understand this systems approach

00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:41.950
to thinking about the economy

00:45:41.950 --> 00:45:43.230
in the broad sense of the term,

00:45:43.230 --> 00:45:45.520
not just the monetary economy

00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:48.160
but the whole structure of governance.

00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:49.970
- Is this a generational thing?

00:45:49.970 --> 00:45:53.030
I mean obviously you've
just walked us through

00:45:53.030 --> 00:45:56.670
how you came to see the
importance of ecology

00:45:56.670 --> 00:46:01.620
and environment and the
turns that you took,

00:46:02.950 --> 00:46:05.550
so the question is is there a kind

00:46:05.550 --> 00:46:08.360
of an environmental
consciousness that you see

00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:11.040
among a broader sweep of students,

00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:14.450
a growing and sort of
growing that actually will

00:46:14.450 --> 00:46:17.123
at a certain point have political impact?

00:46:17.960 --> 00:46:20.350
- Yeah and I think it's been documented,

00:46:20.350 --> 00:46:24.680
but not by me, but by people
who do opinion polling

00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:29.020
and sociologists who
have conducted surveys

00:46:29.020 --> 00:46:32.910
and the young kids coming
out of grade school now

00:46:32.910 --> 00:46:37.910
know so much more about
how the world really works.

00:46:40.310 --> 00:46:42.520
Back when I was a kid nobody was taught

00:46:42.520 --> 00:46:45.190
where food comes from or how climate

00:46:45.190 --> 00:46:48.810
influences our well-being
or any of this stuff.

00:46:48.810 --> 00:46:52.010
Partly we figured it
out, partly we went back

00:46:52.010 --> 00:46:56.780
and back into history
and read accounts of how,

00:46:56.780 --> 00:46:59.830
like Jared Diamond's book Collapse,

00:46:59.830 --> 00:47:01.850
and we learned about the connections

00:47:01.850 --> 00:47:04.017
between the natural world

00:47:04.017 --> 00:47:08.550
and the world of people and society.

00:47:08.550 --> 00:47:13.090
But today I think students
are learning much more

00:47:13.090 --> 00:47:15.550
about this as they come out of school

00:47:15.550 --> 00:47:18.780
and so when students now come into

00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:23.600
our graduate program they
often know in a factual sense

00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:28.290
as much as I do about the
problems that the world faces.

00:47:28.290 --> 00:47:32.430
What they're lacking often
are the analytical tools

00:47:32.430 --> 00:47:36.680
to go deeper and understand deeper causes

00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:38.180
and especially solutions,

00:47:38.180 --> 00:47:43.180
so that's where we can provide
a good training I think.

00:47:43.187 --> 00:47:47.080
- One of the chapters
in The Green Fuse book

00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:50.500
is a visit to China and
there you touch upon an issue

00:47:50.500 --> 00:47:51.890
that we have to put on the table

00:47:51.890 --> 00:47:54.900
namely this whole question
of these late comers

00:47:54.900 --> 00:47:57.760
to development and the consequences

00:47:57.760 --> 00:48:02.240
of their following our erroneous paths

00:48:02.240 --> 00:48:04.320
for global development.

00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:09.320
Now you were involved in the
anti-nuclear build-up movement

00:48:09.650 --> 00:48:13.460
and I know, so give us your insight

00:48:13.460 --> 00:48:17.040
into how this kind of
international dynamic works

00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:21.100
either between environmental
scientists across the globe,

00:48:21.100 --> 00:48:24.090
but beyond that to kind
of global governments.

00:48:24.090 --> 00:48:27.080
- I think what a number of us

00:48:27.080 --> 00:48:29.030
in the environmental movement are doing

00:48:30.150 --> 00:48:32.460
whether we think about
it consciously or not

00:48:32.460 --> 00:48:37.460
is actually trying to
save developing countries

00:48:38.350 --> 00:48:42.693
from a path that will prevent development,

00:48:43.930 --> 00:48:47.880
destroy their quality of
life, and wreck their economy,

00:48:47.880 --> 00:48:50.750
namely a path that looks just like the one

00:48:50.750 --> 00:48:52.410
we in the west took.

00:48:52.410 --> 00:48:53.970
There's a better way to do it.

00:48:53.970 --> 00:48:55.780
If they try to do what we did

00:48:56.740 --> 00:48:59.343
they're not going to get
to our standard of living.

00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:04.000
You just can't do that with
the available resources

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:08.340
and the high population densities
that now affleck Africa,

00:49:08.340 --> 00:49:11.510
China, India, you have to do it better.

00:49:11.510 --> 00:49:13.440
And what we're trying to say

00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:17.230
is that what we should
be doing in the west

00:49:17.230 --> 00:49:19.890
is also what they should
be doing in the south

00:49:19.890 --> 00:49:23.810
and the east, namely
developing sustainable

00:49:23.810 --> 00:49:28.340
renewable resources, solar and wind,

00:49:28.340 --> 00:49:31.960
not oil and coal and natural gas.

00:49:31.960 --> 00:49:33.490
Those are vulnerable sources,

00:49:33.490 --> 00:49:35.390
they're gonna get more and more expensive,

00:49:35.390 --> 00:49:36.750
they're going to foul the air,

00:49:36.750 --> 00:49:38.810
they're going to destroy the climate.

00:49:38.810 --> 00:49:43.810
What we need to do is
develop ourselves better

00:49:45.270 --> 00:49:50.270
by replacing the dirty energy sources

00:49:50.750 --> 00:49:52.670
that led to our development
with cleaner ones

00:49:52.670 --> 00:49:56.520
and see the developing
countries do the same.

00:49:56.520 --> 00:49:58.000
And what I'd love to see,

00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:03.000
my dream is an economic
arms race if you like

00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:05.880
between the solar developers

00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:10.120
and the wind turbine
developers in China and India

00:50:10.120 --> 00:50:14.840
and the south and our own
renewable energy developers.

00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:19.580
Who is gonna be the John D. Rockefeller

00:50:19.580 --> 00:50:21.590
of the second half of this century?

00:50:21.590 --> 00:50:23.710
Who are going to be the corporate giants?

00:50:23.710 --> 00:50:24.930
It's not going to be the people

00:50:24.930 --> 00:50:27.250
pulling oil out of the ground.

00:50:27.250 --> 00:50:29.000
Rockefeller did what he did

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:30.940
because it was a long time ago

00:50:30.940 --> 00:50:32.230
and you could do it then.

00:50:32.230 --> 00:50:34.450
Now it's going to be the people

00:50:34.450 --> 00:50:38.979
who come up with the most cost effective

00:50:38.979 --> 00:50:43.979
energy sources that are
clean and voluminous enough

00:50:44.060 --> 00:50:45.440
to really make a difference.

00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:50.320
And if you look actually,
China is a world leader

00:50:50.320 --> 00:50:52.543
in solar panel development.

00:50:53.984 --> 00:50:56.090
China and Germany are the two leaders,

00:50:56.090 --> 00:50:58.110
we should be, but we're not.

00:50:58.110 --> 00:51:01.570
I'm hoping with the
transition in Washington

00:51:01.570 --> 00:51:04.440
that we will soon get back on that path

00:51:04.440 --> 00:51:06.140
and start competing with
the rest of the world.

00:51:06.140 --> 00:51:09.210
If we don't, we're on the
outside, we're gonna lose

00:51:10.180 --> 00:51:13.100
and the economic giants of
the second half this century

00:51:13.100 --> 00:51:16.290
will be the countries and the corporations

00:51:16.290 --> 00:51:18.820
that have the wisdom to invest

00:51:18.820 --> 00:51:21.010
in these kind of developments.

00:51:21.010 --> 00:51:23.140
- Let's talk briefly about global warming.

00:51:23.140 --> 00:51:25.540
It's an enormous topic, but we've gone

00:51:25.540 --> 00:51:29.320
here we have people like
you warning us decades ago

00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:31.550
that this problem was emerging,

00:51:31.550 --> 00:51:33.610
we've had in the last eight years,

00:51:33.610 --> 00:51:36.260
I guess one could say, science locked up

00:51:36.260 --> 00:51:38.707
in Vice President Cheney's safe--

00:51:39.990 --> 00:51:41.260
- [John] A lock box.

00:51:41.260 --> 00:51:43.090
- That's right, that's right,

00:51:43.090 --> 00:51:48.090
so now we have an administration
that's ready to move.

00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:51.290
What would you like to see happen?

00:51:51.290 --> 00:51:53.470
Obviously, these are long-term problems.

00:51:53.470 --> 00:51:57.340
Today we're doing this
interview in late January,

00:51:57.340 --> 00:52:00.010
report is issued saying that it may be

00:52:00.010 --> 00:52:02.270
the carbon deposits may be irreversible

00:52:02.270 --> 00:52:03.970
or the damage that's being done

00:52:03.970 --> 00:52:05.390
even if we reduce the carbon,

00:52:05.390 --> 00:52:08.180
what would you like to see
the new administration do?

00:52:08.180 --> 00:52:09.920
- I'm glad you asked.

00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:12.690
My wife and I have actually written a book

00:52:12.690 --> 00:52:16.140
and it's available free
online, there's a website,

00:52:16.140 --> 00:52:20.600
it could be a big article
about it in the...

00:52:22.020 --> 00:52:23.750
Berkeleyan, is that the name, the weekly?

00:52:23.750 --> 00:52:25.350
- [Harry] Yeah, the campus paper, yeah.

00:52:25.350 --> 00:52:26.343
- Coming out I think this week--

00:52:26.343 --> 00:52:28.000
- It will when we put this interview up

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:29.150
we'll link to it, yeah.

00:52:30.300 --> 00:52:34.410
- What we do is describe,
the first two chapters

00:52:34.410 --> 00:52:38.340
present to the layperson
a clear simple explanation

00:52:38.340 --> 00:52:43.340
of global warming and why the
science is utterly believable

00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:46.140
and why we should be concerned

00:52:46.140 --> 00:52:47.810
and why we need to take action.

00:52:47.810 --> 00:52:51.440
The next nine chapters
talk about what to do

00:52:51.440 --> 00:52:55.030
and we present a complete coherent plan,

00:52:55.030 --> 00:52:57.770
the technology, the
economics, and the policy

00:52:57.770 --> 00:52:59.910
for achieving a solution.

00:52:59.910 --> 00:53:02.870
And we do this, by the way,

00:53:02.870 --> 00:53:04.610
without any carbon sequestration

00:53:05.945 --> 00:53:09.573
because I not persuaded
that it's plausible

00:53:10.450 --> 00:53:12.650
to sequester carbon and we do it

00:53:12.650 --> 00:53:16.630
without a large commitment to biofuels

00:53:16.630 --> 00:53:20.160
because I'm very concerned
about the competition

00:53:20.160 --> 00:53:22.830
for land between food,
which we're going to need

00:53:22.830 --> 00:53:25.820
more and more of in the
future as population grows

00:53:25.820 --> 00:53:29.010
and land for biofuels, so no biofuels,

00:53:29.010 --> 00:53:34.010
no carbon sequestration,
nuclear we don't require it,

00:53:35.560 --> 00:53:39.290
it's there, but we're not
asking for an expansion of it.

00:53:39.290 --> 00:53:43.230
We rely on efficiency, wind, solar,

00:53:43.230 --> 00:53:46.750
and some geothermal, a lot of efficiency.

00:53:46.750 --> 00:53:48.530
You had an interview with Amory Lovins

00:53:48.530 --> 00:53:52.686
and so you've probably
got a good exposure--

00:53:52.686 --> 00:53:53.519
- Yeah, and re-engineering required, yeah.

00:53:54.480 --> 00:53:58.330
- That's right, the huge
amount of fat in our system

00:53:58.330 --> 00:54:01.550
that can be cut out with efficiency gains.

00:54:01.550 --> 00:54:06.550
And the policy measures
include regulations

00:54:07.660 --> 00:54:09.850
to impose higher and higher

00:54:09.850 --> 00:54:13.030
fuel efficiency standards on automobiles.

00:54:13.030 --> 00:54:16.570
We can easily get to 60
or 70 mile per gallon

00:54:16.570 --> 00:54:19.500
by the year 2025 if we tell the automakers

00:54:19.500 --> 00:54:20.470
they have to do it.

00:54:20.470 --> 00:54:22.240
If we don't tell them
to do it, they won't,

00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:25.220
but if we do, they must.

00:54:25.220 --> 00:54:29.070
And so fuel efficiency
standards for automobiles

00:54:29.070 --> 00:54:31.860
and for homes, new homes,

00:54:31.860 --> 00:54:34.030
appliance standards for air conditioners,

00:54:34.030 --> 00:54:36.363
refrigerators, and stoves and so forth.

00:54:37.360 --> 00:54:41.080
Then I want to, this is one
of the more radical pieces

00:54:41.080 --> 00:54:44.240
of the plan, one way to think about

00:54:44.240 --> 00:54:48.320
what we're asking for is
that we treat solar and wind

00:54:48.320 --> 00:54:49.800
the way we now treat oil.

00:54:49.800 --> 00:54:52.830
We hugely subsidize oil.

00:54:52.830 --> 00:54:55.670
In fact, the Iraq war, which
some people would argue

00:54:55.670 --> 00:54:58.900
is an oil subsidy because
it was a major motivation

00:54:58.900 --> 00:55:02.950
for the war, is going to
cost over a trillion dollars.

00:55:02.950 --> 00:55:05.440
imagine what you could do
with a trillion dollars

00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:10.440
spent on solar and wind
turbines to produce electricity.

00:55:11.800 --> 00:55:14.960
We could wean ourselves
off of all of our coal

00:55:14.960 --> 00:55:16.950
and about three-quarters of our oil.

00:55:16.950 --> 00:55:20.680
We still need some for some
liquid fuels for aircraft

00:55:20.680 --> 00:55:25.680
and so on, but the replacing
current automobiles

00:55:26.450 --> 00:55:29.070
with rechargeable hybrids
and getting the electricity

00:55:29.070 --> 00:55:31.780
to charge them from wind and sun.

00:55:31.780 --> 00:55:34.210
How do we get society to go there?

00:55:34.210 --> 00:55:39.210
Well, shifting subsidies
and then I want to take

00:55:39.610 --> 00:55:44.610
that foolish tax cut that
Bush gave the wealthy

00:55:45.150 --> 00:55:47.950
and I want to keep that as a tax cut,

00:55:47.950 --> 00:55:49.310
but not for the wealthy.

00:55:49.310 --> 00:55:53.490
I want to make it a tax cut,
a tax break on the profits

00:55:53.490 --> 00:55:56.100
from the sale of clean energy.

00:55:56.100 --> 00:55:59.960
There's a motivation for people
to invest in clean energy.

00:55:59.960 --> 00:56:01.810
It doesn't pick winners in advance

00:56:01.810 --> 00:56:04.250
because if you're not selling clean energy

00:56:04.250 --> 00:56:06.190
'cause you didn't invent the right device

00:56:06.190 --> 00:56:07.910
you don't get the tax cut,

00:56:07.910 --> 00:56:11.920
so it's a tax cut that
automatically targets the winners

00:56:11.920 --> 00:56:16.920
and from what I can
understand of investment

00:56:17.270 --> 00:56:20.140
and technology and economics,

00:56:20.140 --> 00:56:23.320
such a tax shift would cause a flood

00:56:23.320 --> 00:56:26.920
of investment money into
the clean energy sector

00:56:26.920 --> 00:56:30.520
and the combination of shifting subsidies,

00:56:30.520 --> 00:56:34.600
shifting that tax break, and regulations,

00:56:34.600 --> 00:56:36.610
we wouldn't even need a carbon tax,

00:56:36.610 --> 00:56:39.550
which I think is politically
a very tall order.

00:56:39.550 --> 00:56:40.610
I don't think it's gonna be easy

00:56:40.610 --> 00:56:43.630
to get a carbon tax in place,

00:56:43.630 --> 00:56:45.730
so we don't need it if
we do all these things.

00:56:45.730 --> 00:56:47.810
- What is the title of the book

00:56:47.810 --> 00:56:50.473
so that people can google
it if it's available--

00:56:50.473 --> 00:56:53.750
- The website where you can
do a free download of the book

00:56:53.750 --> 00:56:58.750
is www.cooltheearth, all
one word, cooltheearth.us

00:57:02.360 --> 00:57:05.070
- And I think our audience
will want to read that

00:57:05.070 --> 00:57:08.140
and it can serve as a guide as they watch

00:57:08.140 --> 00:57:11.410
the new administration move forward,

00:57:11.410 --> 00:57:14.870
but then maybe backward as
it feels political pressure.

00:57:14.870 --> 00:57:16.600
- And the title of the book is

00:57:16.600 --> 00:57:19.343
Cool The Earth, Save The Economy:

00:57:20.580 --> 00:57:24.230
Solving Global Warming Is Easy, EASY

00:57:25.620 --> 00:57:28.690
and the E is for efficiency,
the A is for the automobile,

00:57:28.690 --> 00:57:33.690
the S is for solar, and the
Y is for you and you and you.

00:57:34.320 --> 00:57:38.120
It's for all the things we have
to do as individual citizens

00:57:38.120 --> 00:57:41.290
to complete the four
parts of the strategy.

00:57:41.290 --> 00:57:42.984
- [Harry] Any you co-authored this--

00:57:42.984 --> 00:57:43.817
- With my wife--

00:57:43.817 --> 00:57:44.700
- [Harry] And her name is?

00:57:44.700 --> 00:57:46.540
- Mary Ellen Harte.

00:57:46.540 --> 00:57:49.790
- So the Hartes are giving us something

00:57:49.790 --> 00:57:51.550
that we need to look at and then,

00:57:51.550 --> 00:57:56.330
so John, before I thank you
I want to show this book

00:57:56.330 --> 00:57:58.320
which I read for this interview,

00:57:58.320 --> 00:58:03.280
it's called The Green
Fuse: An Ecological Odyssey

00:58:03.280 --> 00:58:07.020
and our audience will discover
that it's out of print,

00:58:07.020 --> 00:58:09.820
but I'm sure that they
can write to UC Press

00:58:09.820 --> 00:58:12.190
and invite them to reissue it

00:58:12.190 --> 00:58:15.910
or at least put it on in digital format

00:58:15.910 --> 00:58:17.390
so others can get to it.

00:58:17.390 --> 00:58:21.190
So on that note, I want
to thank you for taking us

00:58:21.190 --> 00:58:22.830
on this intellectual odyssey

00:58:24.072 --> 00:58:26.800
'cause it's really
helped us to think about

00:58:26.800 --> 00:58:29.440
the opportunities that
we're now presented with

00:58:29.440 --> 00:58:30.390
with a new administration.

00:58:30.390 --> 00:58:31.551
Thank you very much.

00:58:31.551 --> 00:58:32.384
- [John] Thank you very much.

00:58:32.384 --> 00:58:34.220
- And thank you very much for joining us

00:58:34.220 --> 00:58:36.123
for this Conversation with History.

00:58:37.567 --> 00:58:41.234
(upbeat instrumental music)
