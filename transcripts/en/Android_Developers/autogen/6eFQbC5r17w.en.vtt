groups together by name you still want

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:57.760
groups together by name you still want
 

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:00.180
groups together by name you still want
to use a summary notification for two

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:00.190
to use a summary notification for two
 

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:01.860
to use a summary notification for two
reasons one this is what will show on

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:01.870
reasons one this is what will show on
 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:04.260
reasons one this is what will show on
phones pre n right because we don't know

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:04.270
phones pre n right because we don't know
 

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:05.820
phones pre n right because we don't know
how to do groups pre end so we just show

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:05.830
how to do groups pre end so we just show
 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:08.430
how to do groups pre end so we just show
this summary but in n we'll take that

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:08.440
this summary but in n we'll take that
 

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:09.779
this summary but in n we'll take that
summary and we'll extract little bits

00:06:09.779 --> 00:06:09.789
summary and we'll extract little bits
 

00:06:09.789 --> 00:06:11.159
summary and we'll extract little bits
and pieces of it to make you see that

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:11.169
and pieces of it to make you see that
 

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:12.420
and pieces of it to make you see that
little that little header row right at

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:12.430
little that little header row right at
 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:14.790
little that little header row right at
the top above the bundle we actually

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:14.800
the top above the bundle we actually
 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.170
the top above the bundle we actually
pull that information from the summary

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:16.180
pull that information from the summary
 

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:17.610
pull that information from the summary
so if for example you're displaying

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:17.620
so if for example you're displaying
 

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:20.640
so if for example you're displaying
group that represents one inbox right or

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:20.650
group that represents one inbox right or
 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:22.090
group that represents one inbox right or
one account in your map

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:22.100
one account in your map
 

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:24.010
one account in your map
that might be the place that because of

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:24.020
that might be the place that because of
 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:25.780
that might be the place that because of
the summary we know okay that's the

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:25.790
the summary we know okay that's the
 

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:26.890
the summary we know okay that's the
account name and that's what we'll put

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:26.900
account name and that's what we'll put
 

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:28.600
account name and that's what we'll put
in that summary row but then they each

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:28.610
in that summary row but then they each
 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:29.890
in that summary row but then they each
individual conversation or each

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:29.900
individual conversation or each
 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:32.080
individual conversation or each
individual email thread then goes into

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:32.090
individual email thread then goes into
 

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:34.210
individual email thread then goes into
its own notification in the group and

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:34.220
its own notification in the group and
 

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:35.650
its own notification in the group and

there as the pending intent on the on
the input in and it really really needs

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:55.370
the input in and it really really needs
 

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:57.160
the input in and it really really needs
to be for that action it means to be a

from a notification now I'm about to

00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:19.230
from a notification now I'm about to
 

00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:20.660
from a notification now I'm about to
show you some code for all of this so

00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:20.670
show you some code for all of this so
 

00:18:20.670 --> 00:18:22.250
show you some code for all of this so
just look closely to remember what we're

00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:22.260
just look closely to remember what we're
 

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:24.260
just look closely to remember what we're
actually going to be building this is

00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:24.270
actually going to be building this is
 

00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:27.410
actually going to be building this is
most of the code now those two images

00:18:27.410 --> 00:18:27.420
most of the code now those two images
 

00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:29.570
most of the code now those two images
are extra pages in the notification and

00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:29.580
are extra pages in the notification and
 

00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:31.880
are extra pages in the notification and
extra pages are actually notifications

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:31.890
extra pages are actually notifications
 

00:18:31.890 --> 00:18:33.590
extra pages are actually notifications
in their own right so we're going to

00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:33.600
in their own right so we're going to
 

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:36.080
in their own right so we're going to
create a notification first then we're

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:36.090
create a notification first then we're
 

00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:37.580
create a notification first then we're
going to set that notification the style

00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:37.590
going to set that notification the style
 

00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:40.400
going to set that notification the style
to a big picture style and then attach

00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:40.410
to a big picture style and then attach
 

00:18:40.410 --> 00:18:42.530
to a big picture style and then attach
your image to the style with a simple

00:18:42.530 --> 00:18:42.540
your image to the style with a simple
 

00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:45.920
your image to the style with a simple

second big picture copy/paste works just
 

00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:50.420
second big picture copy/paste works just
as well in code as it does in slides so

00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:50.430
as well in code as it does in slides so
 

00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:53.540
as well in code as it does in slides so
just do that and then to actually add

00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:53.550
just do that and then to actually add
 

00:18:53.550 --> 00:18:54.950
just do that and then to actually add
those pages we're going to need to

00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:54.960
those pages we're going to need to
 

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:57.020
those pages we're going to need to
create a wearable extender and add those

00:18:57.020 --> 00:18:57.030
create a wearable extender and add those
 

00:18:57.030 --> 00:19:00.290
create a wearable extender and add those
to notifications as pages to it finally

00:19:00.290 --> 00:19:00.300
to notifications as pages to it finally
 

00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:02.060

we're gonna build the notification

00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:02.070
we're gonna build the notification
 

00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:04.220
we're gonna build the notification
itself by creating a builder setting the

itself by creating a builder setting the
 

00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:06.680
itself by creating a builder setting the
title text and icons and finally

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:06.690
title text and icons and finally
 

00:19:06.690 --> 00:19:08.120
title text and icons and finally
extending the notification with the

00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:08.130
extending the notification with the
 

00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:09.710
extending the notification with the
wearable extender that we built earlier

00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:09.720
wearable extender that we built earlier
 

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:11.840

open it up for for questions let's get
 

00:28:05.299 --> 00:28:08.409
open it up for for questions let's get
through it first I want to draw your

00:28:08.409 --> 00:28:08.419
through it first I want to draw your
 

00:28:08.419 --> 00:28:09.700
through it first I want to draw your
attention okay let's make sure the

00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:09.710
attention okay let's make sure the
 

00:28:09.710 --> 00:28:12.580
attention okay let's make sure the
keyboard works so this guy here

00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:12.590

it's a new system facility for exactly
this sort of thing and it turns out that

00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:03.250
this sort of thing and it turns out that
 

00:29:03.250 --> 00:29:04.520

so we said fine you know what let's just

00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:34.150
so we said fine you know what let's just
 

00:29:34.150 --> 00:29:36.510
so we said fine you know what let's just
make a real API for this because we

00:29:36.510 --> 00:29:36.520
make a real API for this because we
 

00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:37.590
make a real API for this because we

uses of it so I'll get to that in a

00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:38.830
uses of it so I'll get to that in a
 

00:29:38.830 --> 00:29:40.680
uses of it so I'll get to that in a

do until you go and unblock that so you
 

00:30:30.730 --> 00:30:32.370
