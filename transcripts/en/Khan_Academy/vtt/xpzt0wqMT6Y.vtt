00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:06.660
Your car gets 25
miles per gallon,

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.270
and you want to go on
a 400-mile road trip.

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:17.550
Right now, gas
costs $3 per gallon.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.040
How much will the gas
for your road trip cost?

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.600
So let's see.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:27.000
They tell us they're going
on a 400-mile road trip.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.960
400 miles.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.660
So the first thing that I'd
want to think about is, well,

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.080
how many gallons am I using?

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.080
And then once I know how
many gallons I'm using,

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.720
I know it's $3 per
gallon, so I can

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.680
multiply the number
of gallons by $3.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.960
So to figure out the
number of gallons,

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.990
would I want to
multiply 400 miles--

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:47.770
would I want to multiply that
times the miles per gallon,

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.320
which is 25, or would I want
to multiply by the gallons

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.260
per mile?

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.009
Well, if I multiply by
the gallons per mile,

00:00:56.009 --> 00:00:57.550
and I multiply that
times 400, then I

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:58.840
would get the number of gallons.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.131
So let's just think about that.

00:01:00.131 --> 00:01:05.300
I want to multiply
that times-- and I'll

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:13.950
write the units first--
the gallons per mile.

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.510
And what are the
gallons per mile?

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.340
Well, we have 25
miles per gallon.

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.940
We have 25 miles
for every 1 gallon.

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.370
Or you could say we have 1
gallon for every 25 miles.

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:30.300
So I really just
took the reciprocal

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:35.092
of 25 miles per gallon and
made it 1/25 gallons per mile.

00:01:35.092 --> 00:01:37.300
Now what do we get when we
multiply these two things?

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:38.758
The whole purpose
was to figure out

00:01:38.758 --> 00:01:40.350
how many gallons
we're going to use.

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.540
Well, we see that
our miles cancel out.

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.760
Miles cancel out with miles.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.360
And then I have 400
times 1/25 gallons,

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.900
which is the same thing as
400 divided by 25 gallons.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:57.360
So this is equal to
400/25 gallons, which

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:03.970
is the same thing as 400 divided
by 25 is equal to 16 gallons.

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.550
Now it's always important
to do a reality check here,

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.320
not just to try to
blindly cancel out units.

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.700
Does this actually
makes sense that 16

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.780
is a much lower number than 400?

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:16.750
Well, sure it does.

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.380
And actually, if you have any
experience filling up a car,

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.630
you would sense that, OK,
well, that's about the size.

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.050
On around 16
gallons, a car tends

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.542
to go 300 or 400 miles if it
gets pretty good fuel mileage.

00:02:26.542 --> 00:02:28.250
So that just makes
sense from experience.

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.590
And it also make sense
based on how it's stated.

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.480
You get 25 miles per gallon.

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.590
So you're going to
need fewer gallons

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.140
than you're going to need miles.

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.710
So this all seems to
make sense so far.

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:41.490
But we haven't answered
their question.

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.800
They want to know, how
much will my trip cost?

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.300
Right now, we've just
figured out how much fuel

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.150
we're going to use.

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.004
So then we could
take our 16 gallons.

00:02:50.004 --> 00:02:51.420
And to figure out
the dollar cost,

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.461
are we going to multiply
it by dollars per gallon

00:02:53.461 --> 00:02:55.030
or gallons per dollar?

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.680
Well, if we're thinking
just about unit conversion,

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.330
we want to multiply times
the dollars per gallon.

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.660
So I could write it like this.

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.860
I could write it like
dollars per gallon.

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.420
Actually, let me just write
out the word "dollar."

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.700
Dollars per gallon.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.990
The units will cancel out.

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:15.570
And it also makes sense.

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.210
Whatever number of
dollars per gallon,

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:18.580
I multiply it times
the number of gallons,

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.440
and that's going to tell me
how much it's going to cost.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.106
This happens at the
fuel pump every day.

00:03:22.106 --> 00:03:23.300
Hey, it's $3 per gallon.

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:24.633
I'm going to fill up 16 gallons.

00:03:24.633 --> 00:03:26.400
Hey, 3 times 16.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.400
So let's do that.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.290
So it's $3 per gallon.

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.330
We see the gallons cancel out.

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:40.170
And we are left
with 16 times $3,

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.070
which is the same thing as $48.

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:46.125
And we are done.
