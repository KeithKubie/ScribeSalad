1
00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:06.570
And we're live. What's going on brother? How are you? I'm awesome man.

2
00:00:06.571 --> 00:00:08.520
It's good to be here. Good to have you here man. Thank you.

3
00:00:08.521 --> 00:00:11.490
I've never had a guy come in where his own hat and his own tee shirt.

4
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.290
You're number one. You're the first.

5
00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:15.930
I'm surprised by that given how many podcasts you've done,

6
00:00:15.931 --> 00:00:16.950
but that's how I roll.

7
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.460
I don't know if anybody's ever come in wearing their own shirt. Jamie,

8
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.230
any thoughts? Someone has to, someone has to have, I just can't recall it.

9
00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:29.120
Definitely. No one has worn their own hat and their own shirt. Oh yeah.

10
00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.070
Maybe Eddie's worn his own shirt, but that's a 10th planet shirt.

11
00:00:32.071 --> 00:00:34.440
That doesn't totally count to share it with my face on it too.

12
00:00:34.441 --> 00:00:38.190
So it's a triple whammy. Ari, Ari,

13
00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.990
did you get a new shirt or something? Maybe. I dunno. I don't think so. Maybe.

14
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.410
Anyway, what's going on man? How long are you here for? I'm all good man.

15
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.650
I'm in LA for two weeks. It's my very first time here,

16
00:00:49.651 --> 00:00:52.650
so I just got here two days ago. So just kind of soaking it in.

17
00:00:52.651 --> 00:00:56.180
What's the mind fuck like? It's crazy. Huh? It's weird, man. I feel like a,

18
00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.760
I was driving her, I was driving around and in an Uber and it feels like GTA.

19
00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.780
I think more like GTA feels like LA cause that's what it's based on. But uh,

20
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.580
it was just kind of trippy and there's levels to the game, right?

21
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.600
The top level of the game is probably either like Singapore,

22
00:01:12.301 --> 00:01:13.260
Beijing,

23
00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.310
or Mexico city in terms of Mexico city is the only thing that I've ever seen

24
00:01:17.311 --> 00:01:22.170
that's more chaotic than LA. But LA is, uh, it's, it's right up there.

25
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.160
Yeah. I think Lagos is more chaotic. Lagos, Lagos, Nigeria.

26
00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.340
I've never been, that's more chaotic. And Cairo,

27
00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.380
I think they're definitely more chaotic. Cairo, Egypt. Really? Yeah.

28
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.720
I find them more chaotic. Well, Cairo man, I would love to go to Cairo,

29
00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.040
but I just,

30
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.100
I am nervous about traveling to Egypt and to keep hearing buds.

31
00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.700
I keep hearing two stories from people that go all the time. Like Egyptologists,

32
00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.190
it's amazing. Amazing. Don't worry about it.

33
00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:52.410
The worst thing you have to deal with is constantly beggars.

34
00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.850
And then you hear from other people, fuck that. Don't go there.

35
00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.450
It's sketchy. Yeah. I haven't been, I haven't been for a long time. When I went,

36
00:02:00.451 --> 00:02:03.360
it was when I was a kid. Oh yeah. But Lagos,

37
00:02:03.361 --> 00:02:06.080
I've been to more recently and it's certainly more hectic and,

38
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.270
and chaotic and I think here as well here, it's just, it's just interesting.

39
00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.480
He's a very, very, very spread out and just seeing, yeah,

40
00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.420
just people driving everywhere and not much public transport and all that.

41
00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.020
Even compared to other cities in the U S it just seems like a totally different

42
00:02:19.021 --> 00:02:20.490
vibe. But I like it. Yeah.

43
00:02:20.491 --> 00:02:24.060
There's just too many people stuffed into one area and everyone's driving or

44
00:02:24.061 --> 00:02:26.280
they're in an Uber, so someone else's driving them.

45
00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.820
So it's just constant driving. Yeah. But I'm happy to be here, man.

46
00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.760
It's a little bit surreal, but it's cool. Yeah, I'm sure. Right.

47
00:02:32.761 --> 00:02:37.710
So what are you doing on here? I'm doing, I'm doing this thing. Um, I was, uh,

48
00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.740
on the Rubin report yesterday actually. Uh, I've got,

49
00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.710
got a whole bunch of contests, guys, that conservative guy,

50
00:02:43.711 --> 00:02:46.050
conservative guy that got a on blaze TV,

51
00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.770
the story they wrote about him and he responded, he's like, I'm pro gay,

52
00:02:49.771 --> 00:02:54.060
marriage pro weed legalization, pro prison reform,

53
00:02:54.061 --> 00:02:57.000
pro immigration pro, all these different things.

54
00:02:57.001 --> 00:03:00.040
And yet people are calling them conservative. Well, you know, we live

55
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.270
<v 2>in a times where everyone's saying is right wing, so let it be so hard to know.</v>

56
00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.140
Well, if you're not as progressive as humanly possible,

57
00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.140
you're outright well, yeah, exactly. Pretty much.

58
00:03:11.141 --> 00:03:15.280
I've seen all sorts of titles levied onto everybody,

59
00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.500
including including yourself. So yeah,

60
00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.530
it's interesting for people don't know a Zubie won the world championships and

61
00:03:24.101 --> 00:03:26.740
women's power lifting. Um,

62
00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.100
you identified as a woman for a brief period of time, nine seconds left.

63
00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.510
It's all you have to do. Yeah. I mean this is the, where we live in dude, that,

64
00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:37.600
that thing blew the internet outlets crazy. Insane how far it went mad. Yeah,

65
00:03:37.601 --> 00:03:40.420
I know. I saw that people, uh, there it is. Let's see,

66
00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.010
PSI identify as a woman whilst lifting the weight. Don't be a bigot. You know,

67
00:03:45.011 --> 00:03:49.630
I think, I think when you first talked about that I had like 40,000 followers.

68
00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:53.470
It's now well over 101 hundred and 15 and when I posted it,

69
00:03:53.471 --> 00:03:58.440
I had 15,000 followers, so I've gained a hundred and I've gained 2000 followers.

70
00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.630
Yeah, like 105,000 105,000 followers in that video. Congratulations. Yeah,

71
00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:04.170
thanks man.

72
00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:09.170
It really does highlight how preposterous these new world rules that we have in

73
00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.670
regarding gender are, but to their credit, the U S power lifting Federation,

74
00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.200
I believe that's the name of the organization,

75
00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.240
they just banned transgender women from competing. Okay.

76
00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.160
Just flat does enough. Enough of that I think if you want to compete,

77
00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.590
I don't think there's anything wrong with transgender women competing,

78
00:04:29.591 --> 00:04:31.810
but I think they should compete against transgender women.

79
00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.320
Just like how we have men compete against man and we have women compete against

80
00:04:35.321 --> 00:04:39.250
women. Let's have transgender women compete against transgender women.

81
00:04:39.251 --> 00:04:43.840
Let's not deny science and biology just to make people feel better and just to

82
00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.740
support some strange progressive ideology. Yeah. I think if they,

83
00:04:47.741 --> 00:04:50.650
if the goal is, that's why I think the goal is more about,

84
00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.540
it's more ideologically driven than I think it is actual inclusion driven.

85
00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.120
Because if it's just about inclusion, then yeah,

86
00:04:58.121 --> 00:05:01.540
you can either just have an open category like most men's categories already

87
00:05:01.541 --> 00:05:04.690
are. Then I'll actually restrict it to men. It's just, you know,

88
00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.460
the best of the best. So anyone can do this.

89
00:05:06.461 --> 00:05:10.360
So either that or if there are enough athletes in whatever the given sport or

90
00:05:10.361 --> 00:05:12.310
competition is, then yeah, you can just have a different,

91
00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:16.630
a different category and that way everyone can be included without stepping on

92
00:05:16.631 --> 00:05:19.780
the feet of half the population. That's a bold move by the men.

93
00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:24.400
Say anybody can be in here, man. That's how it is in pool. You know?

94
00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.400
And men can't compete in the women's division of pool,

95
00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:30.100
but women can compete in the men's division. Yeah.

96
00:05:30.101 --> 00:05:32.290
It's the same in the most sports. Most people aren't aware of that.

97
00:05:32.291 --> 00:05:33.610
Most people think that they're,

98
00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:36.040
they have specific restrictions saying only men can do them.

99
00:05:36.041 --> 00:05:37.330
But that's actually quite rare. Well,

100
00:05:37.331 --> 00:05:42.331
there's a lot of successful female to male athletes where females transitioned

101
00:05:44.771 --> 00:05:49.710
to males and dominate male sports. Okay. I didn't, that wasn't true makeup. Oh,

102
00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.870
okay. All right. 100% it's never going to happen.

103
00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:55.290
I'm going to try to figure out why. I was like, why didn't I go?

104
00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:58.190
What the fuck is this? What is going on?

105
00:05:58.460 --> 00:05:59.930
<v 3>I have, well, have you seen this? Uh,</v>

106
00:05:59.931 --> 00:06:03.050
there's a soccer player wants to be in the NFL as a kicker because she,

107
00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:07.310
there's a video of her doing a place kick of a 55 yard or a yard field goal

108
00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:09.740
recently. That's incredible. That's really far, right?

109
00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:12.890
No one coming out or anything. It was just like in practice. But she nailed it,

110
00:06:12.891 --> 00:06:16.190
which is pretty far. Yes. Well, can you tackle kick cores?

111
00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:19.940
They can get hit yet. They're not during the actual play of the kick.

112
00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:21.140
They're not supposed to be touched,

113
00:06:21.141 --> 00:06:24.740
but for sure they're in the play of the field, so. Hmm. Well that's fucked up.

114
00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:29.120
That's not good. That's where the problem is. Carla. Love ya. Yeah,

115
00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:30.133
but stop.

116
00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.220
<v 2>Yeah, that's a bad idea. Oh by the way,</v>

117
00:06:32.221 --> 00:06:36.090
I brought a couple of things for you man. So that's a, is it a Zubie tee shirt?

118
00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:38.820
So the, my latest album that is Zubi tee shirt,

119
00:06:38.821 --> 00:06:40.980
that one actually glows in the dark. It glows in the dark.

120
00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:45.210
It does the CMC that goes on your back. Uh, hopefully it'll kill turtles.

121
00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:49.860
Um, not that aggressively. And that's uh, my new fitness book there as well.

122
00:06:49.861 --> 00:06:53.160
You have a butcher, you already, you already know all that it is. Um,

123
00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:56.070
is it basically, Oh, it's workout routines and yeah,

124
00:06:56.150 --> 00:07:00.120
it's just giving people what they need to know about a nutrition training

125
00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:03.090
mindset, motivation. I just wanted to keep it brief and concise.

126
00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:05.910
All this stuff that I think is most important that people need to know,

127
00:07:05.911 --> 00:07:07.650
whether they're beginners or intermediates. Oh,

128
00:07:07.651 --> 00:07:11.250
this is a good size book to read. Yeah, I put it out first as an ebook,

129
00:07:11.251 --> 00:07:14.520
but then, um, a lot of people asked me to do physical copy, so, Oh, that's cool.

130
00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:17.790
Did those just before leaving the UK and they've essentially sold out already,

131
00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:21.360
so congratulations on that. All you on Fox get out there.

132
00:07:21.361 --> 00:07:24.060
This is a good book for you because it's short. You don't have to like,

133
00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:27.990
people see a fat book, they're like, Whoa, Joe, much work.

134
00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:32.730
But this is a not even a hundred pages. Let's see, six, what is it?

135
00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:36.510
A 93 page, 93. Boom. So there you go. There we go. Strong.

136
00:07:36.511 --> 00:07:40.890
Get all we can all benefit. What is your background athletically, athletically?

137
00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:44.790
Um, I used to actually play rugby. Ah, yeah. So I,

138
00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:47.280
I don't know how much you know about my background. So I was born in the UK.

139
00:07:47.281 --> 00:07:51.930
I grew up in Saudi Arabia. So when I lived, yeah, when I lived in Saudi, um,

140
00:07:51.931 --> 00:07:56.931
I used to play baseball and football or what you guys would call soccer and um,

141
00:07:57.870 --> 00:07:59.130
those were my sort of main sports.

142
00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:01.050
I also did swimming and a bunch of other things.

143
00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:05.490
And then I went to the UK for boarding school actually when I was 11 years old

144
00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:09.930
and there's no, there's no baseball there. So I, yeah,

145
00:08:09.931 --> 00:08:11.220
rugby became my main sport.

146
00:08:11.221 --> 00:08:15.450
I started playing rugby when I was 11 years old and I played that all the way

147
00:08:15.451 --> 00:08:16.740
through to university.

148
00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:21.150
And I got into just lifting weights and stuff when I was in my mid teens.

149
00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:25.660
I have a friend who's British and he says that that is way more common in,

150
00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:30.720
in Europe and the U K sending kids off to boarding school. Um, yeah, I do.

151
00:08:30.721 --> 00:08:32.370
I do think so. Um,

152
00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:36.180
I mean with me it was largely because I was in the American system school system

153
00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:37.050
in Saudi Arabia.

154
00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:42.390
So after fifth grade B because there's a little bit of a transition between the

155
00:08:42.391 --> 00:08:43.920
two systems there, they're quite different.

156
00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:47.340
So it was thought that if I'd stayed all the way up until ninth grade,

157
00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:50.430
then it would be a little bit difficult for me to transition into the British

158
00:08:50.431 --> 00:08:52.170
school system and university system.

159
00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:56.400
So my parents decided when I was 11 same my, my older siblings,

160
00:08:56.401 --> 00:09:00.900
like we all went to boarding school when we were pretty young. So yeah, came,

161
00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:03.600
came back over to the UK and was kind of back and forth between the two

162
00:09:03.601 --> 00:09:07.950
countries for several years and yeah, did things that way. But um, were you,

163
00:09:07.951 --> 00:09:09.420
was your dad in the military or something? No,

164
00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:12.330
my dad is actually a medical doctor. Oh, okay. Yeah. He's a medical doctor. But,

165
00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:15.630
um, he worked for a big oil company out in Saudi,

166
00:09:15.631 --> 00:09:18.270
so we lived there for a couple of, you know, two decades pretty much.

167
00:09:18.271 --> 00:09:21.720
Was that like I enjoyed growing up in Saudi man. Really? Yeah. Yeah.

168
00:09:21.721 --> 00:09:25.800
I actually really liked it. What was it like? It's weird. It reminds me of LA.

169
00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:28.590
I'm being, I'm being serious.

170
00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:36.540
I wasn't ready for that. If there are,

171
00:09:36.541 --> 00:09:40.790
then you don't really don't really see them, um, now, but just a, I think the,

172
00:09:40.791 --> 00:09:43.260
the heat and the, the way that, the way the roads are,

173
00:09:43.261 --> 00:09:46.680
the way it looks actually, like, like, yeah, cause if you live, uh,

174
00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:49.440
like where I lived with sort of an expert community basically.

175
00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:51.120
So we lived kind of in a compound.

176
00:09:51.121 --> 00:09:53.550
So where I lived was a little bit of a little bit of a bubble.

177
00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:57.180
And then outside of that you kinda got what, what I'd call the real,

178
00:09:57.210 --> 00:09:58.043
the real Saudi.

179
00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:00.810
So if you go out into the city or you want to go shopping or something like

180
00:10:00.811 --> 00:10:05.190
that, then you're out there in the real city. So it's very, very different. Um,

181
00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:06.630
it's interesting with me because my,

182
00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:10.110
my family backgrounds originally from Nigeria, but then I was born in England.

183
00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:11.190
I live in England now,

184
00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:15.240
but I lived in Saudi Arabia for 19 years or so.

185
00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:19.350
So I've kind of had exposure a lot, two to three different,

186
00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:24.890
three very different cultures and ways of doing things and even laws and just

187
00:10:25.141 --> 00:10:27.000
the way society is structured and stuff like that.

188
00:10:27.001 --> 00:10:30.840
So I think it's given me a pretty interesting and unique perspective on quite a

189
00:10:30.841 --> 00:10:35.310
lot of things. Yeah. What a broad range of culture that you've been exposed to.

190
00:10:35.311 --> 00:10:37.160
That's pretty fucking cool. Yeah,

191
00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:41.730
Nigeria is a strange spot because I've never, I've never been,

192
00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:45.990
but when you look at the numbers of successful immigrants,

193
00:10:45.991 --> 00:10:50.040
like businessmen and people that have come over from Nigeria and how industrious

194
00:10:50.041 --> 00:10:53.910
they are, and then you look at how many successful Nigerian scammers there are,

195
00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:59.870
it's a wise S very clever place. You got the email from the Prince too, huh?

196
00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:02.210
I didn't get it. I'm sure I have, but I'm,

197
00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:04.680
the one I was thinking about was Jamie,

198
00:11:04.681 --> 00:11:08.220
who was telling me a story yesterday about a guy who, what did he sell?

199
00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:13.470
He sold a nonexistent bank airport. Airport to airport. Yeah, bank too.

200
00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:17.130
That's right. He sold a non-existent airport to obey.

201
00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:21.510
There's been several stories over the last couple of weeks about Nigerian

202
00:11:21.511 --> 00:11:23.490
scammers making big scores.

203
00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:27.840
There's one that I think closed down in Brazilian bank that they took so much of

204
00:11:27.841 --> 00:11:30.390
their money that the bank had to show. The bank had to shut down.

205
00:11:30.391 --> 00:11:35.310
What is it about Nigeria? Why are they so good at that? A lot.

206
00:11:35.311 --> 00:11:37.140
A lot of smart and enterprising people,

207
00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:40.680
and I think if that's channeled in the right way, then that's a very good thing.

208
00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:43.590
I think some people, obviously there's the resources are very limited,

209
00:11:43.591 --> 00:11:47.640
so they're, they're deciding to just go dark and scam people,

210
00:11:47.641 --> 00:11:52.540
but as a person who hasn't been a victim of this, it's quite amusing. Yeah.

211
00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:54.040
If you see, if you

212
00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:57.120
<v 1>see some of the stuff that that can get pulled off. It's a, it's,</v>

213
00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:59.390
it's quite impressive. Yeah. Pull that story is,

214
00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:04.420
it is very much like men is actually 330 equivalent to American dollars.

215
00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:07.930
Three on 30 million. That happened in the 90s though.

216
00:12:07.931 --> 00:12:10.260
I guess the story is just now going around. Okay. Reason,

217
00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:12.100
but it happened in the 90s which is what this says.

218
00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:16.480
Con man once sold in airport. That didn't exist for 330 million.

219
00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:21.460
Now to stop and think about that 330 million in the 90s it's probably like 600

220
00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:26.020
million today or something. Fucking bananas. Yeah. That's hilarious. Yeah.

221
00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:30.400
There's some, there's some crazy stuff that Nigerian fraudster and con artists.

222
00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:34.480
Emmanuel, how do you spell this? How do you pronounce his last name? N. w. U. D.

223
00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:39.070
E. moody. Maybe moody. No, say it again, I'd guess.

224
00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:42.910
Something like that. What do you, you starting with a M. how'd he sang it?

225
00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:47.770
A moody with an N, but are you manual? How are you doing it?

226
00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:51.310
It's, it's an N, but it's a,

227
00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:54.690
the pronunciation is a little bit different. Say it again. [inaudible]

228
00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:59.830
it sounds to me like just say mood day. No, it's a, it's an N. go ahead again.

229
00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:01.420
I'm gonna call it weirdly enough,

230
00:13:01.421 --> 00:13:05.750
that guy's name is two letters off my actual first name. Really? Yeah. My,

231
00:13:05.890 --> 00:13:08.060
my first scenario. First name is Zhu Bay,

232
00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.840
which is spelled N. Z. U. B. E. so that's actually two letters different.

233
00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:18.970
So you just said Zubi would be a little bit more, yeah, as UV is just easier.

234
00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:21.640
It's cool. It's a cool name too. And no one, no one has that. Yeah. Thank you.

235
00:13:21.641 --> 00:13:22.730
I've never heard of before.

236
00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:26.560
So he pulled off the third largest cotton in history by selling it non-existent

237
00:13:26.561 --> 00:13:30.010
airport to Brazilian bank for 250 million us dollars.

238
00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:35.330
But for Nigerian internet scams became synonymous with your original early two

239
00:13:35.861 --> 00:13:39.910
thousands email account and mood day. Did I do it? Yeah. Close enough.

240
00:13:39.911 --> 00:13:44.140
Thank you. Successfully convinced an unassuming bank manager by the name of

241
00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:47.440
Nelson SACA Gucci,

242
00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:52.440
that he was selling a yet to be built airport for a price of $330 million.

243
00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:57.990
As the former director of the union bank of Nigeria himself mu day was privy to

244
00:13:58.301 --> 00:14:02.530
confidential information that was crucial to him pulling off his long con. Oh,

245
00:14:02.950 --> 00:14:07.210
so he knew shit about banking. [inaudible] using the information.

246
00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:12.010
He then impersonated the governor of central bank of Nigeria at the time,

247
00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:17.170
Paul. Okay, here's another one, Paul. Oh GUMA or glaucoma. Oh,

248
00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:20.760
GUMA. [inaudible] so you wouldn't go woo ma.

249
00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:23.480
It's old GUMA or grandma. Oh, go mine. Yeah.

250
00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:27.610
And connected with SoCo Gucci.

251
00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:32.830
We need Steve Aoki to come back and help us with the Japanese name to inform him

252
00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:34.420
of a mouthwatering deal.

253
00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:38.890
Nigeria's plan to build a brand new airport in on another one, a Buddha,

254
00:14:39.010 --> 00:14:43.070
I Boucher. Okay. That's the Capitol. To juice it up a bit. For poorer socket,

255
00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:47.800
Gucci Moo day. Promise, the head of the Brazilian, of the Brazilian bank,

256
00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:52.160
a commission fee to the tune of 10 million us dollars if the deal was approved

257
00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:53.100
<v 4>to get it over the line.</v>

258
00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:58.250
Soka Gucci paid 191 million in cash as you do.

259
00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:02.280
And the remainder in the form of outstanding interest.

260
00:15:02.281 --> 00:15:07.250
A waited patiently for the construction of said airport. Wow.

261
00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:11.240
Wow. That's the kind of thing you can only pull off one. So yeah,

262
00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:13.030
if you can get that guy again, you're,

263
00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:16.790
I just saw a guy that got scammed and there was a documentary about it.

264
00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:18.070
It was a television show rather.

265
00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:22.610
It was really sad because he was a dude who the older gentleman looked like he

266
00:15:22.611 --> 00:15:26.540
was in his sixties and he was convinced that there was this woman who is a,

267
00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:27.260
you know, his,

268
00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:30.830
his love and she lived in Europe and he traveled there and he was sending her

269
00:15:30.831 --> 00:15:35.150
money and the whole deal and he traveled there twice to meet her.

270
00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:38.740
And both times she couldn't see him both times. Wow.

271
00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:41.810
But he still believed in his daughter was like a,

272
00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:43.340
I don't know what the fuck to do.

273
00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:47.180
This guy really believes and you could see how this loss look in his eye.

274
00:15:47.181 --> 00:15:51.770
Like he really believed that there was a woman over there that was corresponding

275
00:15:51.771 --> 00:15:53.900
with him back and forth and he was sending her money,

276
00:15:53.901 --> 00:15:55.320
like sent her a lot of money. Yeah,

277
00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:58.670
I think it was more than a hundred thousand dollars for I remember correctly.

278
00:15:58.671 --> 00:16:02.030
And he really believed that she was going to be there for him.

279
00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:05.380
And then when you went over there, something came up and she couldn't meet him.

280
00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:08.360
And yeah. See it's weird with stuff like this,

281
00:16:08.361 --> 00:16:12.020
I always feel like in some way you kind of feel sad for the person,

282
00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:15.140
but in another you're kind of like, what? What were you thinking?

283
00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:18.590
Like how do you bounce back from that? Like people hit some lows,

284
00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:20.630
he people hit some lows in life.

285
00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:25.610
How do you bounce back from thinking that there's a girl in Europe that's going

286
00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:30.700
to be your love and sending her $100,000 and traveling over there twice and

287
00:16:32.571 --> 00:16:36.410
getting duped? Both times. And then how do you bounce back from that?

288
00:16:36.411 --> 00:16:40.130
And the first thing you should do is not tell anybody like daughter take,

289
00:16:40.131 --> 00:16:44.120
take the El without just quiet. Just take it.

290
00:16:44.121 --> 00:16:48.890
Take it quietly and privately in Dona don't tell people his daughter knew about

291
00:16:48.891 --> 00:16:52.100
it. Okay. So it was like, and then the camera crew,

292
00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:54.830
I mean this motherfucker brought a camera man. I don't know why.

293
00:16:54.831 --> 00:16:59.831
I think the show is very vaguely remember this and I think it was about 10 years

294
00:17:00.741 --> 00:17:04.780
ago. I think this show was all about people that were getting scammed. Okay.

295
00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:08.090
It was about why people get scammed and what, you know,

296
00:17:08.091 --> 00:17:11.380
what is it that makes people believe ridiculous things. Yeah.

297
00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:13.880
But when it comes to romance and money,

298
00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:15.700
those are the two where people get greedy. Yeah.

299
00:17:15.820 --> 00:17:17.240
I was literally gonna say it's greed.

300
00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:20.570
It's greed cause only greedy people can fall for some of those things. I mean,

301
00:17:20.571 --> 00:17:22.920
you see some of those scams and it'll come through saying, okay,

302
00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:25.670
I've just inherited $30 million and a,

303
00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:29.540
I need somebody in the U S with a U S bank account to help me out with this,

304
00:17:29.541 --> 00:17:32.420
and I'll give you a 10% cut. And you know,

305
00:17:32.421 --> 00:17:36.680
that should raise a lot of red flags for anybody who's kind of thinking with

306
00:17:36.681 --> 00:17:38.630
that with the head on straight. That's true.

307
00:17:38.631 --> 00:17:42.440
But if you pay attention to televangelists, do you have those in the UK?

308
00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:48.070
Not like the ones in the U S in the U S it's another level you asked.

309
00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:49.320
It's another level, man.

310
00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:53.790
<v 1>Everything's another level over here. Yeah, everything's bigger, including,</v>

311
00:17:53.791 --> 00:17:55.460
I mean, you get those mega churches and I don't,

312
00:17:56.400 --> 00:18:01.200
there's probably one or two mega churches out there in the UK or in Europe in

313
00:18:01.201 --> 00:18:04.800
general, but not one or two years. That's it. I don't know.

314
00:18:04.801 --> 00:18:05.970
I'm not even aware of any,

315
00:18:05.971 --> 00:18:08.610
I'm kind of hedging my bets saying that's probably a couple,

316
00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:13.320
but I'm not aware of any, not that churches do you think we have in America?

317
00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:15.960
How many do you think we just haven't Texas. Yeah,

318
00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:18.180
Texas might have a million of them. Yeah.

319
00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:20.580
Cause I mean the guys who run those things, they're like,

320
00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:24.930
I mean they did themselves as themselves or celebrities, right? Yeah.

321
00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:28.350
There's at least 10 cause it says, here's an article about the 10 largest.

322
00:18:28.351 --> 00:18:33.150
So in Texas? Yeah, just in Texas. Wow. Yeah.

323
00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:37.050
The, those things. Olsteen guy, he's a fucking baller and a half.

324
00:18:37.290 --> 00:18:42.240
He's got private jets and mansions and he, he bought a, a stadium.

325
00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:46.800
He bought a sports stadium and converted it into his gigantic mega.

326
00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:51.930
Apparently mega church is defined as a church with over 2000 members over 2000

327
00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:52.980
that's a lot.

328
00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:57.980
And there's a given 10% at least 200 to Texas and everyone's given 10% or at

329
00:18:58.531 --> 00:19:01.650
least most of them are given 10% right? Yeah. The tie thing correctly,

330
00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:06.360
what is the, how many do you think there are nationwide? Let's take a guess.

331
00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:09.130
How many mega mega churches are there in America?

332
00:19:09.150 --> 00:19:12.120
So do we know how many there are in Texas? That's just 10 biggest executives.

333
00:19:12.121 --> 00:19:15.000
At least 200 and Texas. That's 200 and Oh wow.

334
00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:17.410
<v 5>Ah, 200</v>

335
00:19:17.410 --> 00:19:22.270
<v 1>and texts, 200 200 fucking people ripping people off.</v>

336
00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:25.900
200 if there's 200 in Texas. Wow.

337
00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:29.140
I'm going to say 3000 nationwide. I was, what?

338
00:19:29.141 --> 00:19:32.020
I'm going to say you're going to say three thousand three thousand mega churches

339
00:19:32.021 --> 00:19:36.220
nationwide. Yeah, I, I'd approximate around that. I'd approximate around that.

340
00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:41.290
What do you think, Jamie? You got your hand on Google though. Don't be cheating.

341
00:19:41.650 --> 00:19:42.011
Oh, too late.

342
00:19:42.011 --> 00:19:45.100
I'm already got answers cause I'd imagine some States don't have any,

343
00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:46.780
what did you think it was going to be, Jamie?

344
00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:50.790
I a couple hundred 500 but there's a lot of that, a lot of them that even,

345
00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:52.750
I don't know, I didn't think there was that many.

346
00:19:52.751 --> 00:19:55.990
That's somewhere in the range of, well,

347
00:19:55.991 --> 00:19:59.770
so since it's 2000 that seems low because like I went to Catholic church and

348
00:19:59.771 --> 00:20:01.920
there's more than 2000 people at some of those churches. Right,

349
00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:03.910
but they're saying mega churches, right? Yeah. But that said,

350
00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:07.090
if that's how they 2000 members are in the church, well,

351
00:20:07.091 --> 00:20:12.091
I mean maybe they just think 2000 scammers that says there's 1300 such

352
00:20:12.281 --> 00:20:15.160
Protestant churches, but then it goes into like,

353
00:20:15.161 --> 00:20:18.970
there's 3000 individual Catholic parishes that have more than 2000 people. So,

354
00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:22.630
Hmm. It gets squirrel. That's what I'm saying. I think several thousands,

355
00:20:22.631 --> 00:20:26.620
like the big building complex, there are large churches that are legitimate.

356
00:20:26.650 --> 00:20:26.890
Yeah.

357
00:20:26.890 --> 00:20:30.430
Like they're really following the Christian doctrine and they're really holding

358
00:20:30.431 --> 00:20:33.580
real services and they're really wanting good for VBL.

359
00:20:33.910 --> 00:20:37.750
And then there's those dudes that have the super expensive tailored suits and

360
00:20:37.751 --> 00:20:40.270
they drive around in rolls Royce prosperity gospel,

361
00:20:40.271 --> 00:20:44.620
they call it prosperity gospel. If you, if you give then you will get,

362
00:20:44.890 --> 00:20:48.140
see what I have. You will get what I have is

363
00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:51.940
<v 2>you bring me your money. Yeah. It's um,</v>

364
00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:53.250
I've got the [inaudible]

365
00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:57.300
<v 1>flying. Oh wow. Oh wait, wait, wait. [inaudible] you haven't seen this.</v>

366
00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:01.580
[inaudible] wait, wait. What is missing? Mississippi pastor dub,

367
00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:04.440
the flying pastor glides into Christmas service.

368
00:21:04.650 --> 00:21:07.440
He's gliding in with an angel outfit on. Please rewind.

369
00:21:07.441 --> 00:21:11.100
I want to see that along. Oh my God, this is so crazy.

370
00:21:11.550 --> 00:21:15.960
He's got an outfit on. He's flying from the sky.

371
00:21:16.050 --> 00:21:19.410
Oh my God. That's his move. That's a good move. Okay.

372
00:21:19.411 --> 00:21:23.800
Because now everybody knows about this move. Oh, he's bringing checks in.

373
00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:28.890
So I was gonna say, is that Beyonce spinning around, you know,

374
00:21:28.891 --> 00:21:33.420
pink had one of them goddamn things. No, she didn't. Um, she was doing Ariel a,

375
00:21:33.421 --> 00:21:37.860
those silk things fell in. Oh wow. Fucked herself up.

376
00:21:37.861 --> 00:21:41.550
Really bad. Like she had like internal bleeding and no,

377
00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:44.520
no fluid in her lungs. Yeah. It was bad.

378
00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:48.660
<v 2>Wow. Yeah. No. These, these mega churches thinking like, I think, you know,</v>

379
00:21:48.661 --> 00:21:51.360
a church, like you said, with a congregation of over 2000 people,

380
00:21:51.361 --> 00:21:53.910
if they're sticking to the script and doing what they're meant to be doing and

381
00:21:53.911 --> 00:21:57.300
not trying to, yeah. At least their fleece, their congregation,

382
00:21:57.301 --> 00:21:59.360
then absolutely nothing wrong with that. It's um,

383
00:22:00.150 --> 00:22:05.150
the ones who use their position of power and their cult of personality to then

384
00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:09.720
just enrich themselves at the expense of their congregation.

385
00:22:09.721 --> 00:22:12.090
Those are the people I think God's going to be having a serious word with.

386
00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:14.160
God's going to be very mad at them. I don't think it's going to be pleased.

387
00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:17.460
Interesting that they like the Nigerian scammers,

388
00:22:17.461 --> 00:22:20.070
they're just playing off of weak minds.

389
00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:25.100
They've just tapped into this group of humans that's gullible and believes

390
00:22:25.231 --> 00:22:29.520
nonsense and they, they know how to, they know how to pull those strings. Yeah.

391
00:22:29.521 --> 00:22:31.440
I think it's, uh, like I say,

392
00:22:31.441 --> 00:22:33.570
when I say I think God is going to be having a word with those people,

393
00:22:33.571 --> 00:22:38.370
I mean that, I mean that very seriously because I think it's, you know,

394
00:22:38.371 --> 00:22:43.371
it's one thing ripping people off or doing some kind of scam or deception or

395
00:22:43.681 --> 00:22:44.514
something.

396
00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:49.760
It's another one using the power of religion to do so where you know that this

397
00:22:53.071 --> 00:22:55.470
is what these people believe in your,

398
00:22:55.471 --> 00:23:00.180
in this position of power and you're now just using that authority to, you know,

399
00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:03.460
buy yourself and you, you Bentleys. And I mean it wasn't there one where I'm,

400
00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:08.550
what's that guy's name? Is it Creflo dollar? The while he think he had,

401
00:23:08.970 --> 00:23:13.470
um, I think he had a G four yet he owned he, yeah, he wants, yeah. And he,

402
00:23:13.710 --> 00:23:14.543
he,

403
00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:18.930
he did basically like a crowd funding appeal to his congregation saying that his

404
00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:19.290
PRI,

405
00:23:19.290 --> 00:23:24.060
his current private jet is the old model and he needs the new model and he crowd

406
00:23:24.061 --> 00:23:27.990
funded, I think to get the G I, I saw this thing, I was just like,

407
00:23:28.050 --> 00:23:32.310
Oh my gosh, like you're shameless and you're famous.

408
00:23:32.430 --> 00:23:37.350
Like I bet Taylor Swift could crowd fund a private jet as ridiculous as it

409
00:23:37.351 --> 00:23:41.220
sounds. Probably if you just were shameless. Yeah. If you just like,

410
00:23:41.221 --> 00:23:44.790
I don't give a fuck. I need a private jet. I want y'all to buy it for me.

411
00:23:45.050 --> 00:23:45.950
Here's the link.

412
00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:47.031
<v 1>I think that's shameless.</v>

413
00:23:47.031 --> 00:23:49.190
But to say you're going to do this and you're going to go to heaven because you

414
00:23:49.191 --> 00:23:51.860
did this, that's Creflo dollar say that you're going to go to heaven,

415
00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:54.560
if you will. His whole thing is the prosperity gospel. That,

416
00:23:54.570 --> 00:23:58.940
so I'm sure there was something in that, you know, be generous now and you know,

417
00:23:58.941 --> 00:24:00.290
you'll be rewarded later, Claire.

418
00:24:00.291 --> 00:24:05.291
It is Creflo dollar would get $70 million Gulf string G six 50 yeah,

419
00:24:06.111 --> 00:24:07.590
that's not right, man. Whoa.

420
00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:13.250
So somehow or another he crowdfunded $70 million. The is that real?

421
00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:16.490
Did he really get that much money? That is a lot of money for a jet.

422
00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:18.950
Why do they cost so much their minute a metal? What are they made out of?

423
00:24:19.910 --> 00:24:23.240
What's going on in there that's so much money. How has that $70 million?

424
00:24:23.241 --> 00:24:28.160
Like if that was a car, right? The same shape, you'd be like,

425
00:24:28.161 --> 00:24:33.050
wow, it's nice car in the air and it flies. It does fly. I mean,

426
00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:36.260
when it goes in the fucking air, I understand, but how much different is it?

427
00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:39.740
It's a lot. I dunno. It's safely goes in the air. Right? Right, right.

428
00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:43.700
But how much different is it fast? Build it very fast, right?

429
00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:45.860
It's definitely different. But how much different,

430
00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:49.650
because if a car was that big, if a car was that big, it was a dope.

431
00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:54.680
His car ever like a Bentley may have bus, let's just say it was $1 million.

432
00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:59.480
Like right. I think in the new Bugatti's, like $12 million, something like that.

433
00:24:59.481 --> 00:25:03.890
Yeah, but that's a different kind of animal, right? Because first of all,

434
00:25:03.891 --> 00:25:07.340
that shouldn't be $12 billion. They're fucking people, right.

435
00:25:07.341 --> 00:25:08.174
In their household,

436
00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:13.720
but also they broke world records like the new Bugatti hit 304 miles an hour,

437
00:25:14.781 --> 00:25:19.130
which is insane. That is insane how fast that is.

438
00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:23.510
I personally don't like them. I don't like the way they look.

439
00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:24.950
I think they look kind of gross.

440
00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:27.200
<v 3>If you bought, there's a difference.</v>

441
00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:30.480
I was just thinking if you bought a booth that Bugatti, you get to drive it.

442
00:25:31.010 --> 00:25:33.270
You buy this plane, you don't get to fly it.

443
00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:36.400
<v 1>That's true. Unless you take the lessons. Why would you want,</v>

444
00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:37.341
if you're going to, yeah.

445
00:25:37.341 --> 00:25:39.710
I think if you're going to spend $70 million on a plane,

446
00:25:39.711 --> 00:25:41.590
I don't think you should be one. The one flying in.

447
00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:42.291
I think you should have some,

448
00:25:42.291 --> 00:25:47.291
some staff asking price $67,950,000 that's a stage where they just rounded up to

449
00:25:49.401 --> 00:25:53.900
70 what does it say? Total hours. 1,616 and you don't want to use it.

450
00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:56.320
Total landings. Oh, so this is light hours.

451
00:25:56.610 --> 00:25:57.830
<v 3>They're all used. Yeah.</v>

452
00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:02.570
They don't make lots of new ones that gets passed around and yeah,

453
00:26:02.571 --> 00:26:06.620
it was made December 16 2014 yeah,

454
00:26:06.621 --> 00:26:10.940
it's a five-year-old jet and it's still 67, nine.

455
00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:12.380
I just wanna make sure the interiors clean,

456
00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:16.080
<v 1>total landings chicks 125 go with that fucking thing with a bus.</v>

457
00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:20.280
When those little blue lights, what is it? A black light? Yeah. Oh my God.

458
00:26:20.281 --> 00:26:24.810
Just splatters TJ's all of this year. If you got Dan,

459
00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:26.730
Bill's Ariens jet. Aw man.

460
00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:32.290
[inaudible] as Coke in between the seeds and just calm everywhere. Oh,

461
00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:35.580
Dan's beard hairs. Everywhere you go, you're picking up beard hairs.

462
00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:40.320
Definitely make sure a pastor gets that one. Yeah, I mean what, what are the,

463
00:26:40.321 --> 00:26:42.780
what's the building cost of making a jet?

464
00:26:42.781 --> 00:26:45.480
Like it's amazing that they retain their value.

465
00:26:45.481 --> 00:26:49.460
To give a yacht is way more like super yachts, you know,

466
00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:53.550
like hundreds of millions of dollars for and great. Yeah. Yeah.

467
00:26:53.551 --> 00:26:56.670
I know some a guys, the Fertittas that own the UFC,

468
00:26:56.671 --> 00:27:00.720
they have some preposterous yacht. I saw Steve jobs yacht,

469
00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:06.510
um, after he was dead in Italy. It was a, it was in the,

470
00:27:06.511 --> 00:27:10.590
on the road in Italy and the guy was with a pointed out to me and it looks like

471
00:27:10.591 --> 00:27:15.590
an Apple store. It looks like a floating Apple store once it Venus, is that,

472
00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:18.470
Oh yeah, there's a couple [inaudible] yeah, that's it. Okay.

473
00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:22.120
Play that God damn floating Apple store doesn't look real. Floating Apple style.

474
00:27:22.150 --> 00:27:26.780
It looks weird and the back is weird saga. Everything is run with IMAX. Yeah.

475
00:27:26.790 --> 00:27:30.060
That's how it looks. And if you look like in the back windows,

476
00:27:30.090 --> 00:27:32.640
it's like everything seemed really,

477
00:27:32.641 --> 00:27:35.670
seems like an Apple store and everything is run with IMAX.

478
00:27:36.490 --> 00:27:41.160
Those IMAX screens are all over the place. [inaudible] trusting.

479
00:27:41.370 --> 00:27:46.280
Yeah. Google needs to step it up. Develop an Android boat, Android phone.

480
00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:49.200
It's a cool looking boat, but yeah.

481
00:27:49.890 --> 00:27:53.490
How much did that fucking thing cost that had it cost $500 million or something

482
00:27:53.491 --> 00:27:57.210
ridiculous. Yeah. Right. You've got to step up the game.

483
00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:00.000
Zubie yeah, man. 100 million.

484
00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:04.960
A hundred pounds cost more than a hundred million. Yeah. Oh, euros. Yeah.

485
00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:07.020
What is the euros to pounds? It's almost

486
00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:09.940
<v 2>almost, it's almost the same. Oh really? Almost parody now. Yeah.</v>

487
00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:13.500
Is pounds almost double what all changes, right? Yeah.

488
00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:16.480
You're your own pounds or almost one-to-one now. Oh, okay. Yeah.

489
00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:18.570
It's like 1.03 or something.

490
00:28:18.730 --> 00:28:21.990
Used to be awesome to go to Canada because if you go to Canada,

491
00:28:21.991 --> 00:28:24.700
your money would go way further. Cause then United States doctors,

492
00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:27.900
the last time I came to the States it was two to one pound.

493
00:28:28.370 --> 00:28:30.510
Like for every a hundred dollars with 50 pounds.

494
00:28:30.511 --> 00:28:35.400
Last time I came and now it's like 50 pounds is like $60 now.

495
00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:38.220
So fucked up. Yeah. That Brexit

496
00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:43.310
founds taken a beating over the last couple of years. Is it? Um,

497
00:28:43.530 --> 00:28:46.290
is it weird the whole Brexit thing over there? Um,

498
00:28:46.590 --> 00:28:49.860
for people who are really into it, I don't follow it that hard.

499
00:28:49.861 --> 00:28:52.890
I'm kind of just bored of it. I'm just kind of just do something,

500
00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:56.700
just make your decision and while the decision should've already been made three

501
00:28:56.701 --> 00:29:00.840
years ago, but just execute it like, let's go, let's get out of here. Um,

502
00:29:00.841 --> 00:29:04.620
what's the general consensus of like your friends and people that you hang out

503
00:29:04.621 --> 00:29:06.720
with over the people? I hang out with, um,

504
00:29:07.050 --> 00:29:10.440
those who live in London are primarily on the remain side.

505
00:29:10.950 --> 00:29:15.900
Those who live outside of London, primarily on the, on the leaf side. Oh.

506
00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:20.700
So it's an urban thing like a United States very much like the cities are

507
00:29:20.701 --> 00:29:24.480
anti-Trump and the farm areas. Yeah.

508
00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:29.640
So if you imagine like London and the Southeast are more equivalent to kind of

509
00:29:30.901 --> 00:29:31.350
like the,

510
00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:36.350
the coastal cities and Pacific Northwest of the U S in terms of being much,

511
00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:39.990
far more liberal in general, um,

512
00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.350
and being more pro EU and pro remain. Whereas if you go outside of that,

513
00:29:44.351 --> 00:29:48.160
if you go up North or to the Midlands or anything like that, then people are,

514
00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.420
um, yeah, I guess both more conservative, I guess in a way.

515
00:29:52.450 --> 00:29:57.450
And also a lot more NTEU in general sentiment [inaudible] so a lot of the people

516
00:29:58.241 --> 00:30:02.830
in London and around London work totally blindsided by the Brexit vote in the

517
00:30:02.831 --> 00:30:04.390
same way that a lot of people, I imagine,

518
00:30:04.391 --> 00:30:08.180
live in Los Angeles and New York were blindsided by the Trump presidency. Yeah,

519
00:30:08.330 --> 00:30:09.340
yeah, yeah.

520
00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:13.480
Have you ever seen the girl with the sock hat on the glosses on knees? Yeah,

521
00:30:13.590 --> 00:30:16.630
I've seen her. Yeah, I watched that one on when I'm feeling a little down,

522
00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:22.470
I watched the Trump reaction video that seems to sort of embody the beginning of

523
00:30:24.610 --> 00:30:29.500
of the chaos that has ensued because things were kind of squirrely before Trump

524
00:30:29.501 --> 00:30:32.560
was elected, but now they're just off the reservation. Yeah,

525
00:30:32.561 --> 00:30:35.560
well that's part of how he got elected. I mean, I was one,

526
00:30:35.770 --> 00:30:39.430
I remember in 2015 before he even won the Republican nomination and I was

527
00:30:39.431 --> 00:30:41.710
talking to people, both friends and family and saying,

528
00:30:41.711 --> 00:30:44.980
I think he has a good chance of winning and people were looking at me like I was

529
00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:47.710
like, I was smoking something. I'm annoyed.

530
00:30:47.711 --> 00:30:51.070
I didn't put any money on it because at the time was there gambling online

531
00:30:51.071 --> 00:30:55.180
gambling? I think the first time at the time I first said it,

532
00:30:55.210 --> 00:30:56.140
I think it was,

533
00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:59.410
I want to say like 40 to one or 50 to one or something ridiculous like that.

534
00:30:59.710 --> 00:31:04.090
I called it on my Netflix special, get the fuck out crazy. I'm like,

535
00:31:04.091 --> 00:31:09.010
we are that close to president Trump. Well, you travel the country,

536
00:31:09.011 --> 00:31:09.311
right.

537
00:31:09.311 --> 00:31:14.020
So I think your perspective is going to be a lot more balanced and actually

538
00:31:14.021 --> 00:31:18.550
accurate. Also, people who don't realize the problems with Hillary,

539
00:31:18.610 --> 00:31:21.970
like she's that I don't think,

540
00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:25.540
I think that if they had gone with Bernie Sanders,

541
00:31:25.541 --> 00:31:27.820
Bernie Sanders could have really won. I really think you could have won.

542
00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:31.330
He could have beaten Trump. Yeah. I don't think Hillary is ever going to win.

543
00:31:31.390 --> 00:31:34.510
She's got too many skeletons. There's too many things you can point to.

544
00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:38.410
There's too much. Too much madness. Too much smoke. Yeah.

545
00:31:38.540 --> 00:31:42.090
This is way too much way. Just way too much. Yeah,

546
00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:44.680
it's been going on like most of my life too. That's the thing.

547
00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:47.110
It's like this isn't a new person.

548
00:31:47.111 --> 00:31:49.420
She's been involved in this thing for decades.

549
00:31:49.580 --> 00:31:54.580
And then when the actual DNC was rigging the primaries against Bernie and Donna

550
00:31:56.201 --> 00:32:00.910
Brazil wrote about it in her book and you go like dirty organization,

551
00:32:00.911 --> 00:32:02.890
it's dirty. Yeah. And she is.

552
00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:05.890
That's the thing that people always forget with Trump is people are always, Oh,

553
00:32:05.891 --> 00:32:07.450
how did he win? Or why did you wonder what,

554
00:32:07.451 --> 00:32:10.840
and it's like you always have to consider like there's all the factors in his

555
00:32:10.841 --> 00:32:14.470
favor, but there's also, I mean, who he was running against.

556
00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:18.580
That's a big part of it. Yeah. That's a big part of it. So people are acting,

557
00:32:18.610 --> 00:32:22.270
acting as if the alternative was so much better or something. And I'm like,

558
00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:26.380
they fucked up, but it wasn't so they fucked up. Bernie could've won. I really,

559
00:32:26.381 --> 00:32:27.390
I really think you could have won.

560
00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:30.430
It would have certainly been more interesting because I know a lot of the Bernie

561
00:32:30.431 --> 00:32:34.810
people went over to Trump rent. Yeah. And say, you know, as time goes on,

562
00:32:35.050 --> 00:32:37.350
one of the things that I've been noticing, and uh,

563
00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:40.430
I watched the David Pakman video the other day where David PAC

564
00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:45.020
<v 4>was pointing out Trump slurring his speech and I had no idea it was that bad.</v>

565
00:32:45.270 --> 00:32:47.690
Oh, really? I haven't seen it. I hadn't seen it.

566
00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:49.790
There was one time where he literally, I mean,

567
00:32:49.850 --> 00:32:54.290
literally like he's fighting through like say if someone puts you on pain

568
00:32:54.291 --> 00:32:56.860
medication, they said, Hey Zubi you gotta make a phone call? Yeah. Oh,

569
00:32:56.880 --> 00:33:01.340
this is really important. You gotta talk to a bank and be like, yo, that is me.

570
00:33:01.550 --> 00:33:03.750
Have you ever gone bless America? Like,

571
00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:07.160
have you ever seen the video of him sweating? No. No dude.

572
00:33:07.190 --> 00:33:09.670
And it's not edited or anything. Oh, no, no, no, no. It's,

573
00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:15.080
he has a really hard time saying God bless America. Pacman pointed out,

574
00:33:15.081 --> 00:33:18.950
it looks like he's like wrestling with his tongue. Something wrong on.

575
00:33:18.951 --> 00:33:20.690
Fair enough. I mean, when I see him, I mean,

576
00:33:20.691 --> 00:33:25.190
that guy's got some crazy energy for, how old is he? 70 73 70 30 that guy's got,

577
00:33:25.191 --> 00:33:29.050
some guys got energy, man. It's called pills. Medicare

578
00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:32.540
fires. You know,

579
00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:36.530
you could fucking hop your grandma up on fucking speed to cheat up all kinds of

580
00:33:36.531 --> 00:33:40.340
shit to say, look, it's legal.

581
00:33:40.341 --> 00:33:45.140
You need get a doctor doc. I'm suffering. I've a, I've got fatigue. I've,

582
00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:49.790
I, I have a chronic fatigue. And the doctor go, well, good thing for you.

583
00:33:49.791 --> 00:33:53.290
We've got a thing called Adderall and mix. That's what it is.

584
00:33:53.900 --> 00:33:55.910
It's something man. Yeah. It's something, I mean,

585
00:33:55.911 --> 00:33:58.820
we've talked about it on the podcast too much. I don't repeat myself. Yeah.

586
00:33:58.910 --> 00:34:01.700
But I really do believe that he's on some kind of stimulant.

587
00:34:01.850 --> 00:34:06.260
He's been on something in the past and there was allegedly a, um,

588
00:34:06.410 --> 00:34:09.740
pharmacy in New York that was prescribing him diet pills for years.

589
00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:13.430
And some journalists uncovered the whole thing. I'm not surprised. Yeah. Look,

590
00:34:13.431 --> 00:34:16.400
I know a lot of people on it, man. Some of them that are functional,

591
00:34:16.401 --> 00:34:20.840
some of them that are off the fucking charts crazy because of it.

592
00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:23.090
Because this video, yeah, this is the video,

593
00:34:23.091 --> 00:34:26.630
but just play the one where you see him slurring his words. Yeah.

594
00:34:26.890 --> 00:34:31.790
Back up a little bit. Raw there. Play that. Listen to this,

595
00:34:33.140 --> 00:34:37.970
our hearts and minds to possible and possibilities.

596
00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:43.190
And finally I asked the leaders of the region political and religious,

597
00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:45.560
Israeli and Palestinian,

598
00:34:45.561 --> 00:34:50.561
Jewish and Christian and Muslim to join us in the noble quest for lasting peace.

599
00:34:53.390 --> 00:34:57.050
Thank you. God bless you. God bless Israel.

600
00:34:57.560 --> 00:35:02.420
God bless the Palestinians and God bless the United States. Judge.

601
00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:05.960
Thank you very much. Oh, those are the last couple of words. Yeah, bro. Yeah.

602
00:35:06.260 --> 00:35:11.150
That is listen to you. Yeah. Now listen to him. Yeah. Listen to you.

603
00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:14.990
Now listen to him. That's a guy who's hopped up on something.

604
00:35:15.230 --> 00:35:17.720
Either hopped up on something or he's dying. It could have been drinking.

605
00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:19.670
He's having, naw, he doesn't drink. He doesn't drink.

606
00:35:19.850 --> 00:35:22.070
Doesn't he know that's cool. Drinking gets in the way of pills, bro.

607
00:35:22.490 --> 00:35:25.160
You don't wanna slow down the pills. You here for progress.

608
00:35:25.161 --> 00:35:30.161
We're here to complete tasks and set goals and conquer and make America great

609
00:35:30.621 --> 00:35:31.100
again.

610
00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:35.210
Mega the way he was a campaigning with the amount of energy that that dude had.

611
00:35:35.211 --> 00:35:37.980
I mean, you gotta assume for a seven year old

612
00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:41.760
<v 1>man, they, they got a medicated on some shit. Yeah, it's entirely possible.</v>

613
00:35:42.260 --> 00:35:45.660
Surprise me. Caden people. Yeah. We were talking about, um, we'll fuck,

614
00:35:45.661 --> 00:35:50.390
was it that told us about Hitler? Hitler with the a were,

615
00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:55.110
I remember who brought it up first, but it's been like three weeks ago now.

616
00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:58.660
Yeah. Hitler, when he went to meet Mussolini,

617
00:35:58.830 --> 00:36:00.480
he was apparently super exhausted.

618
00:36:00.481 --> 00:36:04.350
So they pumped him up with steroids and liquid cocaine, cocaine.

619
00:36:04.530 --> 00:36:07.830
They injected him with steroids and cocaine and then he liked it so much.

620
00:36:07.831 --> 00:36:10.620
He asked for a second dose and they thought they thought it was gonna kill him

621
00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:15.410
and he said, give it to me. And then he went to visit mousseline.

622
00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:18.240
He apparently chewed mousseline his ear off for five hours.

623
00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:21.420
Mostly Laney was apparently thinking about getting out of the war and Hitler

624
00:36:21.421 --> 00:36:24.480
talked him out of it. Just fucking spit and Coke talk at them.

625
00:36:27.250 --> 00:36:28.790
The worst thing you can give to that guy,

626
00:36:28.870 --> 00:36:32.280
that's a fucking Ric flair right there, man. Yeah, I mean,

627
00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:34.380
I think they've done that to people forever.

628
00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:37.200
Apparently that was the case with Kennedy. Kennedy.

629
00:36:37.201 --> 00:36:39.600
They would shoot him up with them. Pheta means really? Yeah.

630
00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:42.210
See if you can find that. Just to keep his energy levels. Okay.

631
00:36:42.330 --> 00:36:47.330
Kennedy was very sick apparently before he died and he had severe back pains.

632
00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:53.220
IQ is, he was really banged up and he had some sort of a disease.

633
00:36:53.221 --> 00:36:57.930
I don't remember what the disease was, but during much of his presidency,

634
00:36:57.990 --> 00:37:00.990
they would put him on amphetamines to keep him active.

635
00:37:01.410 --> 00:37:04.260
They didn't think about the consequences of those things back then.

636
00:37:04.261 --> 00:37:07.770
I don't think they truly understood addiction back then.

637
00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:12.300
I don't think they truly understood the way it affects your decision making

638
00:37:12.301 --> 00:37:14.460
process. Well, that's back when they used to just, you know,

639
00:37:14.461 --> 00:37:18.270
advertise heroin in the newspaper and stuff as a sort of general paint that in

640
00:37:18.271 --> 00:37:21.930
the 60s when was that? When was that? That was what decade was that?

641
00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:22.880
They used to just,

642
00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:26.400
you'd look and you'd look in the papers and they just have like such and such

643
00:37:26.401 --> 00:37:30.060
heroin that take this there and when they used to give women a tapeworm eggs is

644
00:37:30.061 --> 00:37:34.410
diet pills and all that crazy. Yeah, those were the original diet pills, right?

645
00:37:34.411 --> 00:37:35.940
They used to give a women a tape tape,

646
00:37:36.210 --> 00:37:39.720
tape worm eggs so that you ingest it and then obviously the tape worm grows

647
00:37:39.721 --> 00:37:41.580
inside of you and eats all the food and you lose weight.

648
00:37:41.670 --> 00:37:43.830
We have so much to talk about, let's find out, but Kenny first,

649
00:37:44.370 --> 00:37:48.870
so we've heard of dr feelgood. That's who his doctor was.

650
00:37:48.871 --> 00:37:53.400
Dr max Jacobson was injecting him and his wife and a list of other people.

651
00:37:53.430 --> 00:37:57.420
I thought it was a Motley crew song. Wow. Okay. Dr. Jacobs. Oh my God.

652
00:37:58.470 --> 00:38:03.180
Here we go. What does it say here? A the most, scroll up a little bit.

653
00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:06.270
The most famous doctor patients were president and Mrs. Kennedy.

654
00:38:06.271 --> 00:38:09.870
Dr. Jacobson frequently visited the white house and often traveled with the

655
00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:12.180
Kennedys in 1961 for example,

656
00:38:12.181 --> 00:38:17.070
he went with the president to Vienna for a summit meeting with Khrushchev and

657
00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:22.290
Dr. Jacobson said an interview gave the president injections there in addition

658
00:38:22.291 --> 00:38:23.041
to the Kennedys,

659
00:38:23.041 --> 00:38:26.790
other persons who are patients of the doctor included Truman Capote,

660
00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:30.510
Cecil beat to mill, Eddie Fisher, Allen Jay Lerner. I don't know who that is.

661
00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:34.080
Representative Claude pepper of Florida, blah, blah, blah.

662
00:38:34.081 --> 00:38:36.010
A bunch of other politicians probably in Tennessee.

663
00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:36.843
<v 4>Williams. Wow.</v>

664
00:38:37.180 --> 00:38:42.000
Including included among the number of a number of other prominent patients of

665
00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:45.690
Dr. Jacobson have been a bunch of other famous people, blah, blah, blah, blah,

666
00:38:45.691 --> 00:38:46.900
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

667
00:38:47.350 --> 00:38:51.250
And extensive inquiry also turned up the names of well over 100 others in

668
00:38:51.251 --> 00:38:55.090
ranking positions in government, journalism, finance industry, society,

669
00:38:55.180 --> 00:38:58.780
and several entertainment fields who were said to be patients of Dr. Jacobson,

670
00:38:58.781 --> 00:39:02.860
but who could not be confirmed as such. What does it say about, okay.

671
00:39:03.220 --> 00:39:07.840
It cannot be said with certainty that the Kennedy's or with a few exceptions,

672
00:39:07.870 --> 00:39:12.490
any other specific patient received amphetamine. It is known,

673
00:39:12.491 --> 00:39:13.210
however,

674
00:39:13.210 --> 00:39:18.210
that Dr. Jacobson uses unusually large amounts of amphetamine in his practice.

675
00:39:19.390 --> 00:39:23.710
The doctor's office reported the Dr. Jacobson buys amphetamine at the rate of 80

676
00:39:23.950 --> 00:39:25.300
grams a month.

677
00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:30.600
That is enough to make 100 fairly strong doses of 25 milligrams every day.

678
00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:37.800
So he's got a hundred people taking hard core doses of amphetamines every day.

679
00:39:40.330 --> 00:39:44.270
25 milligrams. Apparently. They're saying it's a big dose. I dunno.

680
00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:48.850
What is it a lot? If you just take an Adderall, she was like 10 to 20 max.

681
00:39:48.910 --> 00:39:53.910
Sometimes people that are crazy to get 45 you're fucking grind an enamel that's

682
00:39:54.551 --> 00:39:55.420
injected too,

683
00:39:56.250 --> 00:40:01.200
<v 1>right to the source. Fuck stomach acids get in the blood, baby.</v>

684
00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:05.340
Whoa. Yeah. I think it's been going on forever. Yeah, it seems like it. Well,

685
00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:09.570
I mean it's about energy, right? Like look at poor fucking Joe Biden.

686
00:40:09.571 --> 00:40:12.260
That poor bastard. You've been paying attention to him a little bit. Yeah.

687
00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:16.320
He's bleeding from the eyes. Oh yeah. I saw that on TV.

688
00:40:16.321 --> 00:40:19.980
His eyes just start bleeding. Yeah. How old is he? 1 million.

689
00:40:20.430 --> 00:40:23.700
He's a million years old. He's only like 78 or some shit.

690
00:40:23.701 --> 00:40:27.210
He's not that much older than 78 is too old to be. It is too old.

691
00:40:27.570 --> 00:40:28.680
If you're that guy,

692
00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:32.220
I mean you could be 70 like Jacqueline Lane when he was 78 look fucking

693
00:40:32.221 --> 00:40:36.360
fantastic when he was 90 was pulling boats. Yeah. Did you ever see that?

694
00:40:36.450 --> 00:40:40.560
I don't you to think upside. Zappos is eyeball. Yeah. No that's too old man.

695
00:40:40.730 --> 00:40:43.170
You don't and for evasive answers, evasive answers.

696
00:40:43.170 --> 00:40:46.080
Like I can't see no fucking bleeding and of his eyeballs.

697
00:40:46.081 --> 00:40:49.830
That's like some hell raiser type shit. Cause if you do get into office,

698
00:40:49.831 --> 00:40:52.740
I mean you age at like four times the normal rate or something. Anyway,

699
00:40:52.930 --> 00:40:55.710
he thinks he's been in office but that's horse shit. He was a vice president.

700
00:40:55.711 --> 00:40:57.470
I suggested the vice president is pipe.

701
00:40:57.471 --> 00:40:59.790
Probably the easiest job in the history of the world.

702
00:41:00.270 --> 00:41:04.290
The Brice vice president is like slightly easier than hosting fear factor

703
00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:07.380
[inaudible] that's what I think. You just kind of show up.

704
00:41:07.770 --> 00:41:12.060
Everybody else does the hard work of fucking guide. That's a bear.

705
00:41:12.090 --> 00:41:14.910
That's barely a job. That's like the best way to go into hiding,

706
00:41:14.911 --> 00:41:17.700
become vice president. Nobody gives a shit about you. Okay.

707
00:41:17.940 --> 00:41:20.000
Unless something happens to the president, you've got to step up. Yeah.

708
00:41:20.010 --> 00:41:23.160
But nothing ever happens. Yeah, it's true. The only time it's ever happened,

709
00:41:23.430 --> 00:41:25.170
the last time it was going to, Kennedy got shot.

710
00:41:25.290 --> 00:41:29.880
That was the last time and most likely Lyndon Johnson was in on it. Oh,

711
00:41:30.750 --> 00:41:35.420
Hey. How about that? Oh, I cannot confirm nor deny.

712
00:41:35.540 --> 00:41:38.510
I have no opinion knows who knows what was in on it. But um,

713
00:41:38.810 --> 00:41:41.150
that guy ain't gonna win the, the, ah, the idea that they're,

714
00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:45.260
they haven't pulled that guy aside and go, Hey Joe. Hmm. No,

715
00:41:45.710 --> 00:41:48.500
he's the front runner though, right as it, I don't think anymore.

716
00:41:48.590 --> 00:41:51.980
I think Bernie and Camilla Harris are very close, so Trump is,

717
00:41:51.981 --> 00:41:56.620
should win mainly, but because Tulsi gavage shutdown Camilla Harris in the Bay,

718
00:41:56.840 --> 00:42:01.070
they pushed her out of the debates. Even though on multiple polls,

719
00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:03.800
she has enough support to be in the debates.

720
00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:07.550
They're excluding her from the debates because she attacked Camila Harris and

721
00:42:07.551 --> 00:42:10.700
rightly so and accurately. I think she's on the wrong,

722
00:42:10.701 --> 00:42:12.590
I think she's on the wrong side. I think she's in the wrong party.

723
00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:15.710
Thinks she should be a Republican. I do, yeah. Wow. Yeah.

724
00:42:15.770 --> 00:42:20.330
Why she has all these democratic ideas though. Yeah, that's true.

725
00:42:20.450 --> 00:42:22.460
But given the way the democratic party is going now,

726
00:42:22.461 --> 00:42:26.420
I think she's far too sensible for them. I don't think so. I don't know.

727
00:42:26.510 --> 00:42:29.930
I think they'll come around. Maybe if she doesn't win this term,

728
00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:33.410
she will be president some death. Okay. I really do. Yeah. I watched,

729
00:42:33.411 --> 00:42:36.140
I watched your, um, watched and listened to your, your podcast with her.

730
00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:38.510
So that was interesting. I'm saying few, I saw that one.

731
00:42:38.511 --> 00:42:39.900
I saw the Andrew Yang one as well,

732
00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:44.630
and I think it would be awesome if we had a legitimate badass woman president.

733
00:42:45.290 --> 00:42:47.150
I think she's the one. She didn't do it.

734
00:42:47.210 --> 00:42:50.390
I think it'll ha it'll certainly happen eventually. No question. I don't know.

735
00:42:50.420 --> 00:42:54.680
Next, next time. I don't know. Yeah, I don't like to make public predictions.

736
00:42:54.681 --> 00:42:57.920
I do think if things keep going the way they will,

737
00:42:57.921 --> 00:43:02.390
I do think Trump will take it fairly easily. If they say Latin has changed,

738
00:43:02.510 --> 00:43:06.180
they let Joe Biden get to the front. Trump's gonna win. Yeah. Trump lead him.

739
00:43:06.410 --> 00:43:07.400
Yeah. He'll chew him up,

740
00:43:08.110 --> 00:43:12.230
calls him sleepy Joe Trump will be grinding his teeth and fuck it.

741
00:43:12.231 --> 00:43:13.430
Spit now fillings.

742
00:43:17.270 --> 00:43:21.290
I mean fucking amen in Trump is a funny guy. He says,

743
00:43:21.291 --> 00:43:23.660
funny shit is funny. He knows how to shut people down.

744
00:43:23.690 --> 00:43:27.860
Did you see the thing that he did though with the hurricane map? I didn't know.

745
00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:31.550
He was telling people that the hurricane was headed to Alabama. They're like,

746
00:43:31.551 --> 00:43:35.030
mr president, there is no indication that hurricane is headed to Alabama.

747
00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:40.360
So he posts a map with the hurricane path with a Sharpie that draws Alabama also

748
00:43:42.771 --> 00:43:45.720
in the path of the map, bro. It's so pull.

749
00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:49.850
The one I loved was the, Oh, look at this.

750
00:43:49.970 --> 00:43:54.920
Like you see the path that hurricane and then there's a Sharpie drawn around it.

751
00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:59.930
Okay. See, you see, this is the original and then you see the left,

752
00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:02.390
that Sharpie drawing somebody true.

753
00:44:02.391 --> 00:44:06.220
That was the exact wording that you use today. I saw on the news,

754
00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:10.400
they were saying that like white house officials wouldn't deny that he didn't do

755
00:44:10.401 --> 00:44:11.240
it or something like that.

756
00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:15.410
They wouldn't deny that he did or didn't do it.

757
00:44:15.830 --> 00:44:19.760
So no one's saying the president did not. Definitely did not draw that.

758
00:44:20.150 --> 00:44:23.920
He probably was like, Kimmy, the map. Oh man. We'll just put it here. Just draw.

759
00:44:23.990 --> 00:44:28.920
I bet. Where's Alabama? That one. Okay. Edit in. Just add it in. Yeah.

760
00:44:29.510 --> 00:44:31.980
That guy's funny, man. The, the thing with the Trump tower

761
00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:36.810
<v 2>on Greenland, that was amazing. Yeah. That actually, it's funny,</v>

762
00:44:36.811 --> 00:44:41.190
that tweet, that was very funny, but it's, you know, he's, uh,

763
00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:42.720
and then you guys have your own Trump.

764
00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:46.680
That fucking dude named Boris Boris Johnson, the new prime minister.

765
00:44:47.490 --> 00:44:52.070
He looks like Trump. It's crazy. He's got the crazy hair. Yeah, yeah. Know.

766
00:44:52.210 --> 00:44:55.650
I mean, and he's the one that, he's a pro Brexit guy, right? Yeah.

767
00:44:55.651 --> 00:44:59.640
He was one of the key leaders of the Brexit campaign. So it's happening.

768
00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:05.010
Well, backlash, man. Backlash. I mean, I understand it completely.

769
00:45:05.070 --> 00:45:09.140
I understand it completely. I mean, yeah, a lot of it,

770
00:45:09.150 --> 00:45:12.930
like there are a lot of different factors, but that's a pretty key one.

771
00:45:12.990 --> 00:45:13.950
And just, you know, the,

772
00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:19.100
the condescension from people in certain cities about the rest of the country or

773
00:45:21.450 --> 00:45:22.560
all the other cities. I mean,

774
00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:27.240
you see that it's the same thing in the U S and in the U K like I was saying,

775
00:45:27.241 --> 00:45:27.631
I mean,

776
00:45:27.631 --> 00:45:31.410
when you've got people even just referring to all of middle America is what they

777
00:45:31.411 --> 00:45:34.770
call fly country. Yeah. Like, dude, you can't call it, you can't say that.

778
00:45:34.830 --> 00:45:38.310
And then expect those people to vote. People even, not even just that,

779
00:45:38.340 --> 00:45:41.790
it's expanded even further. And the best evidence is Dave Chappelle,

780
00:45:42.210 --> 00:45:45.590
Dave Chappelle's, recent sticks and stones, Netflix documentary.

781
00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:47.340
For whatever reason,

782
00:45:47.430 --> 00:45:51.990
rotten tomatoes thought it would be a good idea to only have it reviewed by five

783
00:45:52.140 --> 00:45:55.740
super progressive critics. Only critics.

784
00:45:55.741 --> 00:46:00.600
They closed it off to the public. Yeah. It had got 0% on rotten tomatoes.

785
00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:05.370
They then opened it to the public and it got 99% of course,

786
00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:09.840
if that doesn't show a crazy disparity between, first of all,

787
00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:12.000
the idea that you're gonna suppress it,

788
00:46:12.030 --> 00:46:15.360
like you're going to say 0% so no one's going to watch it and we're going to

789
00:46:15.361 --> 00:46:19.350
shut Dave Chappelle down. He's canceled. Fuck him, but people love him.

790
00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:21.370
You can't cancel someone who doesn't care, man. Well,

791
00:46:21.390 --> 00:46:24.780
you can't cancel Dave Chappelle. You can't. But on top of that,

792
00:46:25.500 --> 00:46:26.570
like the,

793
00:46:27.150 --> 00:46:31.980
how would they not understand that someone is going to know that you're not

794
00:46:31.981 --> 00:46:35.460
opening it up to the public and that once it does get open to the public,

795
00:46:35.461 --> 00:46:37.200
you're going to get a massive whiplash,

796
00:46:37.201 --> 00:46:40.980
a backlash where people gonna to come and even if they didn't want to vote on

797
00:46:40.981 --> 00:46:41.071
it,

798
00:46:41.071 --> 00:46:45.630
now they do and now they're going to give it 100% or 99% I knew I had to watch

799
00:46:45.631 --> 00:46:49.110
it when I saw how all the media channel,

800
00:46:49.350 --> 00:46:53.910
many of the media channels that I really dislike and do not respect.

801
00:46:54.810 --> 00:46:56.730
We're coming so hard at it and saying, Oh no,

802
00:46:56.731 --> 00:46:58.230
you don't need to watch it and all this. I was like, Oh,

803
00:46:58.380 --> 00:47:00.240
this means I absolutely have to watch it.

804
00:47:00.241 --> 00:47:04.040
The guardian game in the UK gave it one star and then I saw a vice saying like,

805
00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:07.170
don't watch it. A VOC saying don't want, I was like, okay, this is,

806
00:47:07.171 --> 00:47:10.250
this means that I have to watch this. This is going to be good. Well,

807
00:47:10.350 --> 00:47:11.183
I wasn't disappointed.

808
00:47:11.250 --> 00:47:16.250
Influence of a small group of relatively small group of human beings that are in

809
00:47:17.101 --> 00:47:20.100
charge of these media conglomerates is,

810
00:47:20.290 --> 00:47:24.000
it's really astounding and that they,

811
00:47:24.180 --> 00:47:26.820
it's not just opinion, right?

812
00:47:26.850 --> 00:47:30.520
It's like they're trying to get people to behave

813
00:47:30.850 --> 00:47:35.680
<v 4>and think the way they do. It's activist. Yes, it is activism. Yeah, and it's,</v>

814
00:47:35.710 --> 00:47:40.000
it's also, it's undisguised activism.

815
00:47:40.030 --> 00:47:44.380
It's very transparent activism. It's in a postage journalism.

816
00:47:44.740 --> 00:47:49.740
I really wish there was a place where we could go where we can get 100% unbiased

817
00:47:51.761 --> 00:47:56.140
information and news and we can get an honest perspective of both sides.

818
00:47:56.350 --> 00:47:58.780
This side believes this and this is why they believe that,

819
00:47:58.781 --> 00:47:59.800
but this side believes that.

820
00:47:59.980 --> 00:48:03.070
And this is why they believe that it's very hard to do.

821
00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:04.630
And if you have a podcast,

822
00:48:04.750 --> 00:48:08.920
one of the things that's really interesting is if you even talk to someone who

823
00:48:08.921 --> 00:48:13.921
has an opposing point of view of yours or who is right wing or who maybe has

824
00:48:14.561 --> 00:48:15.700
some questionable ideas,

825
00:48:16.120 --> 00:48:20.920
you are somehow platforming them and supporting their idea and then supporting

826
00:48:20.921 --> 00:48:24.940
some all why. All right. Ideology and it,

827
00:48:26.260 --> 00:48:30.640
there's no room anymore for people to have conversations with people with

828
00:48:30.641 --> 00:48:35.320
differing opinions and just find out why there is. There is.

829
00:48:35.350 --> 00:48:39.490
It's right here. You've, you've literally created it, man. Seriously, you,

830
00:48:39.491 --> 00:48:40.324
you've,

831
00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:45.220
you and a handful of other people have created this and it'd be a nice fact.

832
00:48:45.330 --> 00:48:49.540
Go somewhere. If I could go somewhere things. I mean,

833
00:48:49.541 --> 00:48:51.310
it's nice that I'm doing it, but you gotta trust me.

834
00:48:51.311 --> 00:48:52.420
I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.

835
00:48:52.421 --> 00:48:54.790
I'm not the guy to be distributing information.

836
00:48:54.791 --> 00:48:58.350
I'm certainly not the guy to be analyzing things. I'm too busy. Okay?

837
00:48:58.351 --> 00:49:01.290
I have too many other jobs. I got three kids, I got three jobs,

838
00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:04.510
I've got a lot of hobbies. You know, I'm fucking busy, right?

839
00:49:04.511 --> 00:49:07.780
I'm not the guy to go to that's going to give you an in depth comprehensive

840
00:49:07.781 --> 00:49:10.570
analysis about the way the world works. It's not going to happen.

841
00:49:10.990 --> 00:49:12.030
I'm not your guy. Yeah.

842
00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:14.980
But what I am as someone who's interested in talking to people,

843
00:49:15.070 --> 00:49:19.150
what they should have is someone who has my,

844
00:49:20.290 --> 00:49:22.810
I don't want to say my sensibilities, but my, uh,

845
00:49:22.930 --> 00:49:25.720
my willingness to communicate with almost anybody.

846
00:49:26.380 --> 00:49:31.380
And then also someone who does a real exhaustive research,

847
00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:35.830
does real exhaustive research on the actual facts behind all these critical

848
00:49:35.831 --> 00:49:39.180
issues that are gonna affect everybody. I don't see that anywhere. Well,

849
00:49:39.190 --> 00:49:39.820
you're not gonna,

850
00:49:39.820 --> 00:49:44.710
you're certainly not gonna find it on television just because the format just

851
00:49:44.711 --> 00:49:48.220
doesn't allow for that. You've got the time pressure, the advertising, all that.

852
00:49:48.221 --> 00:49:51.490
It just simply doesn't allow for it. And then in, you know,

853
00:49:51.580 --> 00:49:55.480
the way newspapers and journalism is going, I mean,

854
00:49:55.510 --> 00:49:59.980
the stuff that's been paying is the click baity sort of stuff. You know,

855
00:49:59.981 --> 00:50:02.740
the stuff that gets people outraged, stuff that gets people fired up.

856
00:50:02.770 --> 00:50:05.580
Highly partisan stuff. It's, you know,

857
00:50:05.620 --> 00:50:10.000
being sensible is not the, in the old media,

858
00:50:10.030 --> 00:50:14.470
that's not what seems to be profitable. I know. But is that everything?

859
00:50:14.471 --> 00:50:18.520
Is profitability anything? I mean, where's real journalism? Yeah, because I,

860
00:50:18.521 --> 00:50:23.200
I feel for real journalists because I do think that they are fighting for their

861
00:50:23.201 --> 00:50:27.980
lives in terms of this world. Like nobody, I subscribed a few different

862
00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:28.251
<v 2>things.</v>

863
00:50:28.251 --> 00:50:31.640
I subscribed to the Washington post and the New York times and a few other

864
00:50:31.641 --> 00:50:36.500
periodicals on mine where I pay money to read their stuff online because I think

865
00:50:36.620 --> 00:50:39.380
they have valuable contributions. I just,

866
00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:43.010
I don't think many people are doing that. There's so much free shit.

867
00:50:43.310 --> 00:50:45.530
Vox is free. All these other places are free.

868
00:50:45.740 --> 00:50:50.210
And so if you're only going with free shit, you're only going to get bias stuff.

869
00:50:50.420 --> 00:50:55.420
And you're also only going to get stories that are commercially viable to,

870
00:50:56.270 --> 00:50:59.720
to the people that are making it. And why would they be commercially viable?

871
00:50:59.900 --> 00:51:00.920
Well, they gotta be clickbaiting.

872
00:51:01.150 --> 00:51:04.250
That's the only way you get people to pay attention to shit. And that's,

873
00:51:04.370 --> 00:51:08.120
I think that's, that's already starting to stop working.

874
00:51:08.540 --> 00:51:10.470
You think something click baity stuff. Yeah. I don't know if you,

875
00:51:10.520 --> 00:51:13.400
I mean if you were to think back a couple of years ago where, I don't know,

876
00:51:13.401 --> 00:51:17.900
you'd go on Facebook and you'd get all these kind of like Buzzfeed things and

877
00:51:18.260 --> 00:51:22.760
you had all these new media companies that sprung up and sorta took advantage of

878
00:51:22.761 --> 00:51:27.020
the clickbait era. But people are pretty,

879
00:51:27.170 --> 00:51:28.760
people have become quite wise to that.

880
00:51:28.761 --> 00:51:32.000
Now I think and people are starting to realize,

881
00:51:32.001 --> 00:51:34.490
I mean I think if you went back even a decade,

882
00:51:34.520 --> 00:51:38.600
I don't think most people thought that the media in general was particularly

883
00:51:38.601 --> 00:51:42.230
biased. Um, maybe they would've thought, okay, maybe that one and that one,

884
00:51:42.231 --> 00:51:45.410
but not just generally. Now I think if you were to survey people,

885
00:51:45.411 --> 00:51:48.710
like a lot of people understand that even the ones that are supposed to be

886
00:51:48.711 --> 00:51:51.470
impartial, things like CNN, things like through New York times,

887
00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:55.130
especially when it comes to the opinion pieces, you know,

888
00:51:55.190 --> 00:51:59.150
people know that those things are not just giving it to you straight and they

889
00:51:59.151 --> 00:52:00.410
know you're, you're getting some spin,

890
00:52:00.411 --> 00:52:04.700
some cases you're getting it from a totally partisan angle.

891
00:52:04.701 --> 00:52:07.100
And I think if people are up front with that, if they're like, look,

892
00:52:07.101 --> 00:52:10.010
we're a conservative news outlet. Look, we're a liberal,

893
00:52:10.320 --> 00:52:13.370
left-wing news outlet and that's the filter everything is coming through.

894
00:52:13.430 --> 00:52:16.580
If they're front up front about that, then you know, I'm kinda like, okay, yeah,

895
00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:18.110
that's, that's fine.

896
00:52:18.140 --> 00:52:21.680
But if people claim to be unbiased or claim to be totally impartial and just

897
00:52:21.681 --> 00:52:25.520
bring you the facts without putting too much opinion or spin on it and then you

898
00:52:25.521 --> 00:52:28.370
can kind of see through that and see that's what they're doing and they may not

899
00:52:28.371 --> 00:52:29.780
even know that they're doing it right.

900
00:52:29.781 --> 00:52:31.730
Cause so many people get stuck in these echo chambers.

901
00:52:31.940 --> 00:52:35.720
So I don't think all of it is necessarily on purpose. Um,

902
00:52:35.810 --> 00:52:39.590
but that's just how it is. And I think the vibe I'm certainly getting,

903
00:52:39.591 --> 00:52:42.500
I know with myself and with other people and listening to what people are saying

904
00:52:42.501 --> 00:52:45.110
is people are starting to notice it a lot more.

905
00:52:45.111 --> 00:52:50.030
I know you've talked a lot about the online tech censorship and bias and stuff

906
00:52:50.031 --> 00:52:51.710
like that, which is another thing that again,

907
00:52:51.711 --> 00:52:53.120
I think if you went back 10 years ago,

908
00:52:53.390 --> 00:52:56.660
I don't think people thought that Facebook or Twitter or YouTube or any of these

909
00:52:56.661 --> 00:52:59.780
things were biased. Whereas now in 2019 it's like, okay,

910
00:52:59.781 --> 00:53:03.770
you've got enough examples to see, okay there are diff de platforming,

911
00:53:04.430 --> 00:53:08.090
a lot of people have certain political persuasions and then you've got other

912
00:53:08.091 --> 00:53:13.091
people who are outright calling for violence or just saying like crazy stuff or

913
00:53:13.341 --> 00:53:15.920
threatening people and they're fine.

914
00:53:15.921 --> 00:53:19.210
They're turning a blind eye to it and it's so,

915
00:53:19.250 --> 00:53:20.840
it's just in your face and it's kinda like,

916
00:53:20.841 --> 00:53:24.650
well this isn't me being a conspiracy theorist. It's just, look,

917
00:53:24.651 --> 00:53:26.010
they've taken that person, that person,

918
00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:28.800
<v 4>that person, that person, but all these people, they're still there.</v>

919
00:53:28.801 --> 00:53:33.540
So these rules are not being applied fairly. That's certainly the case.

920
00:53:33.541 --> 00:53:37.860
And it's also certainly the case that they're trying to manage this stuff at

921
00:53:37.861 --> 00:53:40.170
scale. Right? So they're trying to manage,

922
00:53:40.171 --> 00:53:44.460
like one of the things that I got from communicating with Jack Dorsey,

923
00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:48.780
the head of Twitter, is that you saw him when he got hacked. Yes.

924
00:53:49.160 --> 00:53:53.420
When the head of Twitter gets hacked, you're like, damn. [inaudible].

925
00:53:53.790 --> 00:53:58.320
Apparently they used a very simple way to do it, SMS text,

926
00:53:58.440 --> 00:54:02.370
because they used to have a system we could send texts through, you know,

927
00:54:02.450 --> 00:54:06.530
to Twitter through text messages and they hacked it that way. Yeah.

928
00:54:06.690 --> 00:54:10.050
That was so weird. I was on Twitter when it happened. I was like,

929
00:54:10.051 --> 00:54:14.820
scrolling through my feed. I was like, what? Wait,

930
00:54:14.821 --> 00:54:17.460
what's going on here? And it was just, it is fun, right?

931
00:54:17.461 --> 00:54:19.770
Isn't it fun when someone like Jack gets hacked?

932
00:54:21.300 --> 00:54:23.760
When someone like jackets hack, it's like, wait a minute, wait a minute,

933
00:54:23.761 --> 00:54:26.700
wait a minute. The guy who's the fucking head of Twitter,

934
00:54:27.030 --> 00:54:28.240
who's been at the head of this,

935
00:54:28.260 --> 00:54:30.990
the helm of the controversy when it comes to censorship,

936
00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:34.740
it got hacked and his pin tweet is something about a,

937
00:54:35.040 --> 00:54:39.270
how Twitter wants to open up conversations and get somebody very, very positive.

938
00:54:39.600 --> 00:54:42.060
And then underneath it it was just like, Whoa.

939
00:54:42.460 --> 00:54:46.110
I think he really does want to open up conversations and he really does believe

940
00:54:46.111 --> 00:54:51.111
that block chain is eventually going to have virtually every conversation that

941
00:54:51.871 --> 00:54:55.080
everyone has ever had ever available for everyone online.

942
00:54:55.260 --> 00:54:58.080
And that the idea of censorship is going to be preposterous in the future.

943
00:54:58.081 --> 00:54:59.040
And I think he's right.

944
00:54:59.490 --> 00:55:04.260
And I think that's one of the reasons why his own personal philosophy is that

945
00:55:04.261 --> 00:55:06.450
Twitter should essentially be a town hall.

946
00:55:06.510 --> 00:55:09.360
And this is what he and I is when we got into it,

947
00:55:09.361 --> 00:55:13.080
particularly with the Tim Poole and Vigia when we talked about it,

948
00:55:13.140 --> 00:55:14.760
his philosophy,

949
00:55:14.761 --> 00:55:19.530
his personal philosophy is that Twitter should be available to anyone to

950
00:55:19.531 --> 00:55:23.520
communicate their ideas and that it should operate much like the first

951
00:55:23.521 --> 00:55:25.050
amendment. So you know,

952
00:55:25.051 --> 00:55:27.420
the only thing you can't do is call for violence and dogs,

953
00:55:27.421 --> 00:55:29.970
people and things along that. Are they going to bring people back then?

954
00:55:30.180 --> 00:55:32.550
They should have told him he should. She said they should.

955
00:55:32.551 --> 00:55:36.990
And then he said that there was a thing, an idea of a wild West Twitter.

956
00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:40.110
Like you'd have two Twitters, you'd have a curated Twitter,

957
00:55:40.290 --> 00:55:41.150
and then you'd have a,

958
00:55:41.160 --> 00:55:46.160
anything goes to it or a gap to bring back Alex Jones and whoever the fuck else

959
00:55:46.501 --> 00:55:50.820
has been banned. Who's, who's a few people, the big ones. Laura Loomer. Yeah,

960
00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:54.390
all them. Megan Murphy. Yeah. Megan Murphy is a ridiculous way.

961
00:55:54.391 --> 00:55:55.440
She's been on my podcast.

962
00:55:55.620 --> 00:55:58.950
I want to get her on know we've talked about having her on a,

963
00:55:59.100 --> 00:56:03.090
I hope eventually I can, if people don't know what happened,

964
00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:06.150
she got banned from cheese, what's called a turf,

965
00:56:06.180 --> 00:56:11.180
which is a trans exclusionary radical feminist and trans exclusionary,

966
00:56:12.750 --> 00:56:16.050
that's a weird word. Exclusionary. I don't even say it right.

967
00:56:16.051 --> 00:56:18.540
I say exclusionary, exclusionary.

968
00:56:19.320 --> 00:56:23.130
Radical feminist is someone who thinks that trans women are not women.

969
00:56:23.530 --> 00:56:26.010
And so she has said, you know,

970
00:56:26.210 --> 00:56:31.210
publicly that she doesn't think that trans women should be in feminist spaces.

971
00:56:33.521 --> 00:56:35.080
Yeah. Communicating as women.

972
00:56:35.500 --> 00:56:38.170
And so she got into it on Twitter with someone and she said,

973
00:56:38.171 --> 00:56:42.910
but a man has never a woman and they lifetime ban. Yeah. They know.

974
00:56:42.911 --> 00:56:46.150
They actually told to take that down. So she took it down,

975
00:56:46.151 --> 00:56:49.450
but she made a screenshot of it and then she posted up the screenshot that said

976
00:56:49.840 --> 00:56:52.300
a man is never a woman and they gave her a lifetime ban,

977
00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:56.740
which is goddamned hilarious. Yeah, I mean that's crazy.

978
00:56:56.780 --> 00:57:00.940
I don't get the lifetime. Oh we were talking about gay people on Milo as well.

979
00:57:00.941 --> 00:57:04.240
Of course. Smile know got taken off several years ago. Let's see.

980
00:57:04.241 --> 00:57:08.440
They wouldn't tell me exactly why Milo got taken off.

981
00:57:08.470 --> 00:57:11.800
They said that Milo had harassed Leslie Jones, but he hadn't.

982
00:57:11.801 --> 00:57:12.850
He made fun of her.

983
00:57:13.060 --> 00:57:18.060
But apparently there was some allegations that there was many accounts other

984
00:57:18.341 --> 00:57:21.910
than Milo's connected to Milo that Milo was operating.

985
00:57:22.660 --> 00:57:23.860
This was the allegation.

986
00:57:24.280 --> 00:57:27.850
I don't know if that's true and this is one of the reasons why they had made the

987
00:57:27.851 --> 00:57:30.310
decision, but that might not be the case.

988
00:57:30.311 --> 00:57:32.860
That might be the case of someone saying, Hey,

989
00:57:33.010 --> 00:57:36.770
we suspect that these other accounts are also run by Milo.

990
00:57:36.900 --> 00:57:39.820
So cause they wouldn't say it on the podcast. Yeah. Thing is, look,

991
00:57:39.850 --> 00:57:43.930
even if even if someone did get banned for genuinely violating some terms of

992
00:57:43.931 --> 00:57:48.700
service, the idea of a lifetime ban, I mean forever,

993
00:57:48.701 --> 00:57:53.380
you're 90, they're still ban. That's insane. I mean, you can be a,

994
00:57:53.381 --> 00:57:53.920
you've got,

995
00:57:53.920 --> 00:57:58.540
you'll have literally convicted hardcore criminals on there who can have Twitter

996
00:57:58.541 --> 00:58:00.070
accounts and stuff, but it's like, okay,

997
00:58:00.071 --> 00:58:02.590
you said something that someone didn't like. I'm having them again.

998
00:58:02.591 --> 00:58:05.200
This is another Gavin McInnes. Yeah, there's, there's quite a few.

999
00:58:05.440 --> 00:58:06.071
There are quite a few.

1000
00:58:06.071 --> 00:58:09.460
Now the problem is when you ban these people the way there,

1001
00:58:09.490 --> 00:58:13.990
they've done it radicalizes people in opposition. Absolutely.

1002
00:58:14.020 --> 00:58:17.470
And it also looked, here's the reality, man.

1003
00:58:17.840 --> 00:58:21.340
Twitter is a terrible way to communicate. It's fucking terrible.

1004
00:58:21.341 --> 00:58:25.120
Limited amount of text. Text is a terrible way to communicate. Sure. I mean,

1005
00:58:25.121 --> 00:58:28.230
we were just talking, Jamie and I were talking yesterday about, uh,

1006
00:58:28.330 --> 00:58:32.890
disagreements that people have had that we know through emails like that.

1007
00:58:32.891 --> 00:58:37.720
Emails, like someone reads it wrong and then someone sends you a message, Hey,

1008
00:58:37.930 --> 00:58:40.870
you know, this guy's disrespecting me. And then you go and read it and you go,

1009
00:58:40.871 --> 00:58:45.670
what is going on here? Man, cause people read into texts, they,

1010
00:58:45.680 --> 00:58:50.670
they, they just decide that things in text means certain things.

1011
00:58:50.770 --> 00:58:54.160
They might not really be accurate. Yeah. I think that's a problem.

1012
00:58:55.030 --> 00:58:56.190
And I think that the,

1013
00:58:56.191 --> 00:58:59.140
the method of communication through Twitter is just a terrible method.

1014
00:58:59.660 --> 00:59:03.430
Twitter is good for letting people know you got things coming up. I'm like, Hey,

1015
00:59:03.540 --> 00:59:07.900
I've got an album out. Yup. Bang, perseverance, perseverance.

1016
00:59:09.190 --> 00:59:13.550
Zuby Twitter's good for, uh, I love it for posting science stories. Okay. Yeah.

1017
00:59:13.630 --> 00:59:15.480
And interesting stories. So is amazing.

1018
00:59:15.620 --> 00:59:17.320
Twitter is the best social media platform by a mile.

1019
00:59:17.380 --> 00:59:20.500
I don't interact with people anymore. I don't even read it. I don't blame me.

1020
00:59:20.530 --> 00:59:21.920
I send things

1021
00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:24.650
<v 2>to the world that I think are interesting and I hope people enjoy it.</v>

1022
00:59:24.850 --> 00:59:28.310
Like genuinely, I don't want, I don't bash anybody on Twitter.

1023
00:59:28.340 --> 00:59:30.050
I don't attack anybody on Twitter.

1024
00:59:30.051 --> 00:59:34.520
I've had opportunities where someone's informed me of something that someone

1025
00:59:34.521 --> 00:59:37.020
else has said and I'm like that. It's not even sure people say, well,

1026
00:59:37.120 --> 00:59:39.440
it's stuff about you man. Oh that's interesting. People say some,

1027
00:59:39.510 --> 00:59:41.930
some wild stuff about just, just generally. But you know,

1028
00:59:41.931 --> 00:59:43.490
I think when it comes to communication,

1029
00:59:43.491 --> 00:59:48.140
the further you move away from face to face, real world communication,

1030
00:59:48.350 --> 00:59:53.000
the further you abstract away from it, the worse the communication method is.

1031
00:59:53.001 --> 00:59:56.830
And the easier it is to, I mean cause you lose so much. Yes. Um,

1032
00:59:56.940 --> 01:00:00.920
and then the easier it is to intentionally distort it is it is. And you know,

1033
01:00:00.921 --> 01:00:05.150
you lose. So a phone call, I mean real life is the best.

1034
01:00:05.150 --> 01:00:06.140
And then second to that,

1035
01:00:06.141 --> 01:00:10.250
probably a video chat after that phone call after that,

1036
01:00:10.370 --> 01:00:15.050
a text after that, a tweet and the further you abstract away from it,

1037
01:00:15.051 --> 01:00:18.200
you just lose more and more of the actual communication.

1038
01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:22.610
Cause you can't read any body language now. There's no intonation in the words.

1039
01:00:22.611 --> 01:00:25.020
You can't tell. I could say something now and it's like, you know,

1040
01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:27.560
you say something with a smile on your face. It's Joe, he's joking.

1041
01:00:27.860 --> 01:00:31.820
But if you tweet those exact same words, one person over read it and be like,

1042
01:00:32.180 --> 01:00:34.820
okay, I think he's Joe. I think he tweeted that with a smile on his face.

1043
01:00:35.210 --> 01:00:38.150
Someone else's like, no, that's, that's dead serious. Like that's a,

1044
01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:41.090
that's something crazy he's saying there and nobody really knows.

1045
01:00:41.450 --> 01:00:43.600
And then because it's all public, I mean it's,

1046
01:00:43.870 --> 01:00:45.230
Twitter is weird because there's not,

1047
01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:49.460
it's like just going into a room and just full of people in just shouting

1048
01:00:49.461 --> 01:00:51.860
something. Yes. It's not like a forum where it's like, okay,

1049
01:00:51.861 --> 01:00:55.340
this is the topic we're talking about this right now. Twitter is just like, ah,

1050
01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:57.590
this is what I think about anything.

1051
01:00:57.710 --> 01:01:01.430
And you just throw it out there and then you wait for people to people to come

1052
01:01:01.431 --> 01:01:04.250
back with stuff. You know what's interesting is on someone tries to be,

1053
01:01:04.550 --> 01:01:09.080
someone tries to establish a narrative about themselves on Twitter.

1054
01:01:09.350 --> 01:01:09.621
Like,

1055
01:01:09.621 --> 01:01:14.621
Hey listen as a happily married man who's a Christian or this and that and that

1056
01:01:15.710 --> 01:01:19.150
like, wait, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa. Who are you talking to? Well you,

1057
01:01:19.151 --> 01:01:20.990
you shout in the South. What are you trying to,

1058
01:01:21.230 --> 01:01:25.160
are you trying to describe yourself for people so people have a certain way of

1059
01:01:25.161 --> 01:01:27.430
viewing you? Oh yeah. Cause that shit ain't gonna work. Yeah,

1060
01:01:27.530 --> 01:01:30.320
they're immediately going to go, why are you talking like this?

1061
01:01:30.470 --> 01:01:32.330
What kind of person says these things?

1062
01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:37.340
What kind of person like tries to establish a narrative about them? Well,

1063
01:01:37.341 --> 01:01:40.280
they do before they even talk. I mean, people do that with their Twitter bio.

1064
01:01:40.430 --> 01:01:43.130
Oh yeah. They'll do it with their bio. I mean, some people will put in,

1065
01:01:43.131 --> 01:01:46.850
you know, this is my species, my, my location, my pronouns,

1066
01:01:47.150 --> 01:01:52.070
my religious or nonreligious views. You know who I vote for?

1067
01:01:52.071 --> 01:01:54.830
Like all of that. Yeah. Here's my device folks.

1068
01:01:54.831 --> 01:01:57.680
If you see anybody that says they them as their pronouns, black them,

1069
01:01:58.310 --> 01:02:01.100
just black them right now. No. Got some,

1070
01:02:01.101 --> 01:02:03.380
I've got something I'm trying to coin is Zumiez razor,

1071
01:02:03.410 --> 01:02:06.320
which is that if someone on Twitter has their pronouns in their bio,

1072
01:02:06.770 --> 01:02:11.040
then there's like a 95% chance that you can just dismiss them. Yeah.

1073
01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:12.360
Dismiss a lot of what they are saying.

1074
01:02:12.730 --> 01:02:14.630
Suebies razor is a very easy way of describing it.

1075
01:02:14.631 --> 01:02:17.270
I'm going to use that for that online. I'm going to call it zoomies raiser.

1076
01:02:17.540 --> 01:02:20.670
You know what's interesting? I noticed that you have an phone. What Apple did.

1077
01:02:20.671 --> 01:02:25.350
The fuck people is a, when someone is about to write a tax to get those dots.

1078
01:02:25.351 --> 01:02:27.750
Dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot.

1079
01:02:27.751 --> 01:02:31.140
To let you know their typing and then it goes away like, Oh,

1080
01:02:31.650 --> 01:02:35.010
they were gonna type something and then they fucking stopped.

1081
01:02:35.310 --> 01:02:40.050
Whereas at the Android, you send a text, you get a text back.

1082
01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:44.670
Maybe you do, maybe you don't, but you don't know if anybody's in the middle.

1083
01:02:44.790 --> 01:02:46.110
They could write some long,

1084
01:02:46.111 --> 01:02:49.380
lengthy bullshit texts and then wake up sober and go, Oh my God.

1085
01:02:49.381 --> 01:02:51.870
Thank God I didn't send that. You know, it's like emails.

1086
01:02:51.900 --> 01:02:56.460
You don't know whether or not someone's gonna. Someone's replying to an email,

1087
01:02:56.700 --> 01:02:59.610
but that dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot. You get that on Instagram too.

1088
01:02:59.610 --> 01:03:03.760
If you send a DM to someone that says typing. Ooh, that's a weird one.

1089
01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:06.570
Gives people anxiety too. It does. You can annoy people. You can,

1090
01:03:06.571 --> 01:03:10.860
you can just start typing and then just walk away. It's just a typing it.

1091
01:03:10.861 --> 01:03:13.470
Go to the movies. Just,

1092
01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:17.370
just keep the app open and use other apps. Yeah, it's crazy.

1093
01:03:17.371 --> 01:03:18.420
All the social media stuff.

1094
01:03:18.421 --> 01:03:22.950
I feel like we're just right now in the middle of sort of the biggest experiment

1095
01:03:23.250 --> 01:03:27.000
amongst humankind that's ever taken place and we're, you know,

1096
01:03:27.001 --> 01:03:27.930
we're all Guinea pigs in it.

1097
01:03:27.931 --> 01:03:31.830
Like we have no idea what the longterm implications and repercussions of some of

1098
01:03:31.831 --> 01:03:32.760
this stuff is going to be.

1099
01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:36.300
But it's like we're all just in here using all these different platforms and uh,

1100
01:03:36.810 --> 01:03:39.480
I mean you can already see some of the effects. Yeah. It's, uh,

1101
01:03:39.900 --> 01:03:43.200
it seems pretty well documented that things like depression and anxiety are

1102
01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:46.350
going up as use of social media goes up. I mean,

1103
01:03:46.351 --> 01:03:49.620
literally during the introduction of it with the smart phones,

1104
01:03:49.650 --> 01:03:52.110
it's the combination of smart phones and social media. Yeah,

1105
01:03:52.111 --> 01:03:54.150
I think that does it. I don't think, it's not smart phones alone.

1106
01:03:54.300 --> 01:03:55.710
It's not social media alone.

1107
01:03:56.010 --> 01:04:00.480
Like when you had to go login on a PC to use my space or Friendster or high five

1108
01:04:00.481 --> 01:04:01.314
or whatever,

1109
01:04:01.380 --> 01:04:04.770
and then you go out the house and you're no longer on it is just a fact.

1110
01:04:04.771 --> 01:04:08.520
People are constantly carrying it around and trying to get this validation.

1111
01:04:08.521 --> 01:04:09.270
And you know,

1112
01:04:09.270 --> 01:04:13.360
you've got Instagram now talking about potentially removing likes or [inaudible]

1113
01:04:13.530 --> 01:04:13.921
YouTube,

1114
01:04:13.921 --> 01:04:16.590
removing views because they're seeing how it's affecting people and all this

1115
01:04:16.770 --> 01:04:19.800
kind of stuff. And yeah, it's not going to work though.

1116
01:04:21.550 --> 01:04:24.900
[inaudible] it's too late and the box is open. You know,

1117
01:04:25.550 --> 01:04:29.850
you're a grown ass man. So for you you can handle all this shit. Yeah.

1118
01:04:29.910 --> 01:04:31.920
I think the real problem is kids. Yeah.

1119
01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:37.160
Kids growing up being 13 and 14 having Twitter and Instagram and Facebook and

1120
01:04:37.321 --> 01:04:41.100
having anonymous people say really shitty things to them.

1121
01:04:41.101 --> 01:04:44.730
Anonymous friends or enemies at school. That's a real issue.

1122
01:04:44.731 --> 01:04:48.270
In Jonathan Haidt wrote a great book called the coddling of the American mind.

1123
01:04:48.271 --> 01:04:49.620
Great book. It's a really good,

1124
01:04:49.621 --> 01:04:53.040
great book and it goes into that and dev and it really made me fucking super

1125
01:04:53.041 --> 01:04:58.041
nervous for my kids like growing up and developing during this time where we

1126
01:04:59.131 --> 01:05:02.820
have this, you know, sort of uncharted territory of social media.

1127
01:05:02.970 --> 01:05:06.300
There's not like a lot of documented history of use.

1128
01:05:06.390 --> 01:05:09.780
So we can go back to a hundred years of people using social media and this is

1129
01:05:09.781 --> 01:05:12.570
the way to do it healthily and this is the way to, you know, there's,

1130
01:05:12.571 --> 01:05:15.790
there's people that are just fucking tweeting all day long.

1131
01:05:16.110 --> 01:05:19.370
It's just an experiment I think going crazy, pulling her fucking hair out,

1132
01:05:19.390 --> 01:05:21.010
taking pills, barely,

1133
01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:25.690
barely getting by in this life and just tweeting all day long. Yeah, it's weird.

1134
01:05:25.691 --> 01:05:29.800
And you've got people have different and then you've got people who just post 10

1135
01:05:29.801 --> 01:05:34.710
selfies a day, the same, same picture, same face, and just do it.

1136
01:05:35.080 --> 01:05:37.480
Really? Yeah, there's some, it's generally women,

1137
01:05:37.750 --> 01:05:39.910
but there are some people's profiles you can go and it's just,

1138
01:05:39.970 --> 01:05:44.020
you go on their Instagram page and it's just all just their face. Same face,

1139
01:05:44.021 --> 01:05:48.550
same pose and just the times a day just there. But over and over again,

1140
01:05:48.850 --> 01:05:51.760
you see that video clip where the girl had the selfie stick and she's,

1141
01:05:51.790 --> 01:05:54.940
she's trying to get a photo of her own, but with this, with the selfie stick,

1142
01:05:54.941 --> 01:05:58.480
she's like on a deck chair. I've seen that. Yeah. That's hilarious.

1143
01:05:58.570 --> 01:06:02.590
And someone took a picture of her doing it so her ass is straight up in the air

1144
01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:05.740
and she's got the selfie stick up like that. Oh my God.

1145
01:06:06.010 --> 01:06:08.590
She's trying to get that perfect ass angle. I was like, wow,

1146
01:06:08.620 --> 01:06:13.570
that's a 2019 [inaudible] Thursday. People are so thirsty.

1147
01:06:13.571 --> 01:06:17.050
They want likes so badly. Yeah, it is. It is very weird.

1148
01:06:17.051 --> 01:06:20.470
And then you've had people who have died because of it. Oh yeah. Yeah.

1149
01:06:20.530 --> 01:06:23.740
I don't even Canyon. You keep falling off the grand Canyon. Really? Yeah.

1150
01:06:24.060 --> 01:06:25.990
Falling to their death. People falling off buildings.

1151
01:06:25.991 --> 01:06:30.670
There was a couple where the is, she doesn't even have a selfie stick.

1152
01:06:30.810 --> 01:06:35.350
I was not sure. Still loving our generation. Who posted that?

1153
01:06:35.730 --> 01:06:37.930
Oh no, she, yeah, she has got herself his Dick Barstool.

1154
01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:40.180
She has got the selfie style. She does have a self mistake. Oh,

1155
01:06:40.181 --> 01:06:42.910
she put it on the selfie stick. Look at that dirty bitch.

1156
01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:44.740
[inaudible] C C C right there.

1157
01:06:44.741 --> 01:06:47.200
She's got her arm up and this is like not good enough.

1158
01:06:47.470 --> 01:06:52.150
Let's get that selfie stick out. Oh my God. God. That is so hilarious. Strange.

1159
01:06:52.180 --> 01:06:53.870
But imagine if that's your daughter. You're like, mm.

1160
01:06:55.750 --> 01:06:56.360
<v 6>[inaudible].</v>

1161
01:06:56.360 --> 01:06:59.470
<v 2>It's really strange cause if I done, cause I think it's,</v>

1162
01:06:59.471 --> 01:07:02.370
it's both exposed people for what they are,

1163
01:07:02.400 --> 01:07:05.370
but it's also changed people's behavior. Yes. You know,

1164
01:07:05.371 --> 01:07:08.010
people do things now that you just wouldn't even,

1165
01:07:08.011 --> 01:07:10.350
something as simple as taking a picture of your food. Well,

1166
01:07:10.351 --> 01:07:12.240
here's something that never existed before.

1167
01:07:12.950 --> 01:07:17.230
<v 1>So this is a, a move that women do where to put my phone. Oh.</v>

1168
01:07:17.880 --> 01:07:22.290
Oh my God. I lost my phone. Oh no, that's probably in my car. Oh, well no. Yeah,

1169
01:07:22.291 --> 01:07:25.740
here it is. Hold on. My purse. My man.

1170
01:07:26.760 --> 01:07:29.690
This is something that you see now that you never saw before. Ready?

1171
01:07:29.910 --> 01:07:32.460
Here's the look. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

1172
01:07:34.460 --> 01:07:38.960
<v 2>Chicken neck. Girls do that to try and get the right angle.</v>

1173
01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:42.920
Got to get the right side. Nobody's do that before. No. Right.

1174
01:07:42.921 --> 01:07:45.260
That's a new thing. That's a new one. You'd have their head. Yeah.

1175
01:07:45.290 --> 01:07:49.670
It's taking photos of yourself is a pretty new concept. I remember in my space,

1176
01:07:49.671 --> 01:07:50.690
people used to do it in the mirror,

1177
01:07:51.140 --> 01:07:52.830
in the bathrooms and bathroom and stuff like that,

1178
01:07:53.040 --> 01:07:54.790
and that's when they first got thirsty. Yeah.

1179
01:07:55.030 --> 01:07:58.640
They first started seeing six backs and nice asses and people, yeah,

1180
01:07:58.641 --> 01:07:59.181
it's just weird.

1181
01:07:59.181 --> 01:08:01.460
I just wonder what the effect will be in a couple of decades to be honest with

1182
01:08:01.461 --> 01:08:02.294
you. Coincidentally,

1183
01:08:02.450 --> 01:08:07.450
my space is also right around the time that white people started figuring out

1184
01:08:08.050 --> 01:08:11.570
that they like big asses. Something's happened with that. It hasn't there.

1185
01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:16.010
I was talking about this with one of my friends, like go to like the Dukes

1186
01:08:16.010 --> 01:08:18.290
<v 4>of hazard. Yeah. Okay. This is what I was talking about the other day.</v>

1187
01:08:18.291 --> 01:08:19.130
A Catherine Duke.

1188
01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:24.160
She was like one of the hottest women on the planet earth and like 1980 and

1189
01:08:24.710 --> 01:08:27.860
she's a beautiful lady with an ass as flat as this table.

1190
01:08:28.030 --> 01:08:32.530
[inaudible] she probably never did a squat. Yeah. Ever. And uh,

1191
01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:36.200
nowadays that won't fly you. You, yeah. You can't get by.

1192
01:08:36.710 --> 01:08:40.940
You can't get by without a big caboose. It's weird. It's um, part evolution,

1193
01:08:40.970 --> 01:08:45.780
part diet part. I don't know. Doctors, doctor, a lot of squats,

1194
01:08:46.130 --> 01:08:46.731
squats, you know,

1195
01:08:46.731 --> 01:08:49.370
going to the gym has become a lot more mainstream though in general, hasn't it?

1196
01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:53.050
It certainly has, but there's a lot of gals out there faking stock. Yeah.

1197
01:08:53.150 --> 01:08:57.200
There's a lot of gals out there with some plastic shoving their buttocks area

1198
01:08:57.260 --> 01:09:01.220
and ready for this Don Don Don ass cancer.

1199
01:09:01.580 --> 01:09:06.580
There's a a whole group of humans that are experiencing cancer in their ass

1200
01:09:08.990 --> 01:09:10.340
because of ass implants.

1201
01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:14.870
Really the same kind of cancer that many women get when they get breast

1202
01:09:14.871 --> 01:09:19.280
implants. Oh, it's not 100% of them, but it's,

1203
01:09:19.460 --> 01:09:23.660
it's, it's relevant. Like there's an issue.

1204
01:09:23.661 --> 01:09:26.570
There was an article written about it recently that women are starting,

1205
01:09:26.760 --> 01:09:31.760
their doctors are starting to find the same types of cancer that some women get.

1206
01:09:32.050 --> 01:09:32.600
Cause you know,

1207
01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:36.110
everyone's body reacts differently to everything and there are certain risks

1208
01:09:36.111 --> 01:09:39.140
that you take if you get some sort of an implant in your body that your body

1209
01:09:39.141 --> 01:09:40.910
rejects it or that it causes cancer.

1210
01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:44.960
So women are getting cancer of their ass. Man,

1211
01:09:45.110 --> 01:09:46.610
that's a rough cancer bro.

1212
01:09:46.940 --> 01:09:50.390
You got to go in there and scoop out chunks of your butt and maybe you die.

1213
01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:53.540
Maybe you die. It's not worth it because you weren't willing to do squats.

1214
01:09:53.780 --> 01:09:56.120
Just do squats. That's the thing you can do squats.

1215
01:09:56.390 --> 01:09:58.400
It's like if a guy has a little Dick, all right,

1216
01:09:58.401 --> 01:10:01.610
and there was a machine that let you build your Dick up.

1217
01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:05.180
There would be a line around the block for that machine. All right.

1218
01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:08.270
I mean everybody would be on that goddamn Dick machine,

1219
01:10:08.780 --> 01:10:13.490
but women have a way to build their ass up and it is a real thing.

1220
01:10:13.491 --> 01:10:17.270
You can do squats and dead lifts. You can run stairs,

1221
01:10:17.690 --> 01:10:21.950
you can do squats and dead lifts and you will get a big firm ass man. It works.

1222
01:10:22.130 --> 01:10:25.310
You know you're not going to get a J-Lo ass unless you've got those hips. Yeah.

1223
01:10:26.090 --> 01:10:30.030
Have you seen when guys do the, um, like the six pack implants?

1224
01:10:30.250 --> 01:10:33.020
So of course you must've seen like since you know synthol and stuff where they,

1225
01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:37.370
where they, yeah. Inject the oil into them. It's like the muscles will swell up.

1226
01:10:37.590 --> 01:10:42.320
Yeah. People do weird, crazy. People do some strange, some really strange stuff.

1227
01:10:42.410 --> 01:10:45.290
The six back one is the weirdest though, because it's just this,

1228
01:10:45.530 --> 01:10:49.580
it's just there all the time. Yeah. Even if they raped. Yeah.

1229
01:10:49.581 --> 01:10:51.380
But it looks weird cause some, even if they,

1230
01:10:51.381 --> 01:10:55.310
even if they gained weight and the rest of their body is kind of flabby,

1231
01:10:55.490 --> 01:10:58.580
you still just got it looks like a Ninja turtle. That's what, yeah,

1232
01:11:00.650 --> 01:11:05.320
it's like bullshit. That's the perfect scribe. God. Yeah.

1233
01:11:05.370 --> 01:11:08.930
It looks like bellyache AB implants over his keg.

1234
01:11:09.020 --> 01:11:11.360
It looks like a bows Bowzer from Mario. You know,

1235
01:11:12.470 --> 01:11:14.220
show me in the large

1236
01:11:14.220 --> 01:11:18.330
<v 1>version. Jesus Christ. That's weird. Right? That's so crazy.</v>

1237
01:11:18.331 --> 01:11:22.260
Because that guy's fat. It just doesn't look right. Wow. That's so weird.

1238
01:11:23.540 --> 01:11:27.510
And that's definitely fake isn't only that guy just does a shit ton of setups.

1239
01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:31.770
No, cause he's got a barrel chest, but he doesn't have any, any pecs,

1240
01:11:31.771 --> 01:11:34.720
which is weird. Who is that said celebs thing.

1241
01:11:34.740 --> 01:11:38.380
This guy was on big brother in the UK and he definitely got an AB plan. Yeah,

1242
01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:42.460
that's, that's a fact. Yeah, 100% I'm pretty sure. I don't know.

1243
01:11:42.600 --> 01:11:45.810
I'm pretty sure that are, yeah, that's it. It shows up plastic surgery,

1244
01:11:45.811 --> 01:11:49.260
pasta cabs. Go back to that image that you were just at before.

1245
01:11:50.490 --> 01:11:54.510
Go back to where you just wear it. No, scroll down. No, no, no.

1246
01:11:54.540 --> 01:11:56.340
On the other side, scroll down though. The,

1247
01:11:56.341 --> 01:11:58.740
the boxer right there and the left hand side. Yeah.

1248
01:11:58.890 --> 01:12:03.030
That guy was a boxer above it right there. That guy had pec implants. Okay.

1249
01:12:03.060 --> 01:12:06.750
That was a boxer with pec implants and like crazy plastic surgery face.

1250
01:12:07.110 --> 01:12:09.090
He uh, we, we,

1251
01:12:09.300 --> 01:12:13.260
we watched a video of him before he was fighting in Mexico.

1252
01:12:13.290 --> 01:12:15.870
We had like fixed fights in Mexico.

1253
01:12:15.880 --> 01:12:18.240
Remember that this guy had like fake everything,

1254
01:12:18.241 --> 01:12:23.230
like fake fake chest and fake muscles and just so weird. Cause it doesn't even,

1255
01:12:23.820 --> 01:12:26.490
cause it's so strange though, cause it doesn't even, it doesn't even function.

1256
01:12:26.930 --> 01:12:30.900
Yeah. Right. If you had big arms or arms, arms that look big,

1257
01:12:30.930 --> 01:12:35.490
pumped up with synthol or whatever, but then they're not even strong. Right.

1258
01:12:35.550 --> 01:12:39.240
And then the problem is look at that neck, grab ahold of that neck, bro.

1259
01:12:39.930 --> 01:12:40.470
You ain't,

1260
01:12:40.470 --> 01:12:45.030
you ain't defending any chokes or that does a tiny ass neck.

1261
01:12:45.240 --> 01:12:45.921
Oh that, that, that,

1262
01:12:45.921 --> 01:12:49.620
that one there that before and after a really shows on the left, the abs.

1263
01:12:50.370 --> 01:12:54.600
Oh yeah, go to that far left. Yeah. You can. That really shows that. Wow.

1264
01:12:54.601 --> 01:12:57.360
That's incredible. My God.

1265
01:12:57.660 --> 01:13:00.900
But what's weird is because your abs only look like that if you're leaning like

1266
01:13:00.901 --> 01:13:03.600
if you're F if you're flexing them, yes, but when they do that,

1267
01:13:03.601 --> 01:13:07.800
it's like that all the time. All the time. So it just,

1268
01:13:07.890 --> 01:13:10.680
it just doesn't look right. Look at that. That's incredible. This is different.

1269
01:13:10.681 --> 01:13:13.170
This is not an implant,

1270
01:13:13.171 --> 01:13:17.640
but like sculpting in some way with that guy did also lose weight between those

1271
01:13:17.641 --> 01:13:19.350
two pictures. Yeah, he certainly did.

1272
01:13:19.351 --> 01:13:22.230
He certainly dropped his body and it looks like he's arms and chest got bigger

1273
01:13:22.430 --> 01:13:24.100
too. He leaned out. I'm not buying that one.

1274
01:13:24.630 --> 01:13:27.960
And then that you got that synthol guy up there. I don't know. People do.

1275
01:13:27.961 --> 01:13:29.430
Some people do some strange things.

1276
01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:34.560
The thing is a woman can get things done like boobs and no one cares.

1277
01:13:34.860 --> 01:13:38.490
Guys, look, she looks hot. But if a guy's got like a fucking sock and it's,

1278
01:13:40.500 --> 01:13:42.360
Oh Whoa, that guy.

1279
01:13:42.390 --> 01:13:46.620
We're looking at a girl who has fake implants of her, her abdomen,

1280
01:13:46.740 --> 01:13:50.640
her abdominal muscles that are so obviously fake that they're over her ribs.

1281
01:13:50.641 --> 01:13:51.210
Yeah.

1282
01:13:51.210 --> 01:13:55.140
Like those muscles are literally over the rib cage where they don't even belong.

1283
01:13:55.170 --> 01:13:59.400
No. Hmm. That's nuts. Is it face to steroids?

1284
01:13:59.700 --> 01:14:01.890
So you can see like, look. Yeah. So look at that guy.

1285
01:14:01.891 --> 01:14:05.850
You can see when he's sitting [inaudible] go to that guy. The abs are still,

1286
01:14:06.620 --> 01:14:10.200
it's just so ridiculous. It just doesn't look right. He is too, bro.

1287
01:14:10.201 --> 01:14:12.460
You got to lose weight if you're gonna rock fit.

1288
01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:17.290
That's so lazy in eight pack too. That's so lazy. See, abs are a weird one.

1289
01:14:17.410 --> 01:14:19.990
Cause if you really desperately wanted to abs, everybody can get them.

1290
01:14:19.991 --> 01:14:23.260
If you just work hard enough, you know abs, it's not like,

1291
01:14:24.070 --> 01:14:26.720
what is that? Jesus Christ. Guys,

1292
01:14:26.770 --> 01:14:31.460
abs and then a weird swelling underneath. Yeah. Him,

1293
01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:36.340
his flesh Fanny pack. Yeah, but that's what is that right? Don't, I don't know.

1294
01:14:36.341 --> 01:14:41.020
Sorry. What is that? That's just a weird picture. Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

1295
01:14:41.110 --> 01:14:44.890
But guys with fake things that like get no respect.

1296
01:14:45.640 --> 01:14:48.520
You know what I mean? A guy with a fake Dick, like, get out of here.

1297
01:14:48.521 --> 01:14:53.100
A guy with a fake PEX kick go away. What is this? Whoa.

1298
01:14:53.290 --> 01:14:55.900
Injected into his balls. Oh my God,

1299
01:14:55.930 --> 01:15:00.580
man dies after injecting silicone into his testicles for sex cult game.

1300
01:15:01.060 --> 01:15:03.220
Okay. Yeah, that's all I had issues.

1301
01:15:04.060 --> 01:15:08.680
But like dudes with fake pecs and guys would fake muscles.

1302
01:15:08.681 --> 01:15:11.800
Like nobody wants to see that shit. No, I just go to the gym and eat. Right.

1303
01:15:11.801 --> 01:15:16.000
It does work. Yeah. We imagined really if there was a Dick growing machine,

1304
01:15:16.090 --> 01:15:19.900
you know like a squat rack for your Dick boy,

1305
01:15:20.650 --> 01:15:25.360
boy would there be aligned. But after I wouldn't,

1306
01:15:25.361 --> 01:15:28.400
it just become like that would just become the new norm. If everyone,

1307
01:15:28.470 --> 01:15:31.810
the girls will be all stretched out. Everybody have a giant hog. But you know,

1308
01:15:31.860 --> 01:15:33.770
I don't, I don't actually think most people would just lie.

1309
01:15:33.771 --> 01:15:36.220
Most people don't go to the gym. I mean,

1310
01:15:36.221 --> 01:15:39.700
you've already got this option to increase your muscles and make yourself look

1311
01:15:39.701 --> 01:15:40.750
better and most people don't do it.

1312
01:15:40.990 --> 01:15:44.020
So I'm not convinced that if it took actual work and effort,

1313
01:15:44.050 --> 01:15:45.910
I don't actually think the majority of people would do it.

1314
01:15:45.970 --> 01:15:48.310
I think you're a hundred percent correct. Yeah. If it was difficult,

1315
01:15:48.311 --> 01:15:50.650
it was hard work. That's why people want these operations.

1316
01:15:50.651 --> 01:15:52.300
All they have to do is go to the doctor's office.

1317
01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:54.580
The doctor's going to take care of everything. Mike,

1318
01:15:54.581 --> 01:15:57.190
I'm going to put you under and when you wake up,

1319
01:15:57.191 --> 01:15:58.930
you're going to have a hog of a lifetime.

1320
01:15:59.620 --> 01:16:04.360
You're going to have the giant PEX and a false sculpted six pack and synthol

1321
01:16:04.420 --> 01:16:05.500
stuffed muscles.

1322
01:16:06.040 --> 01:16:10.330
There's one video of this guy that's Brazilian dude who's got these synthol

1323
01:16:10.331 --> 01:16:13.400
muscles and he's dancing and it looks like he's got water balloons all over

1324
01:16:15.250 --> 01:16:17.490
[inaudible] talking about like the, the,

1325
01:16:17.890 --> 01:16:22.000
the body dysmorphia where people just don't see what other people see.

1326
01:16:22.001 --> 01:16:24.940
Like same as anorexics and same as, you know,

1327
01:16:24.941 --> 01:16:26.800
I guess bodybuilders have that same issue,

1328
01:16:26.801 --> 01:16:30.340
like a lot of really enormous bodybuilders still feel like they look small.

1329
01:16:30.820 --> 01:16:33.760
Yeah. It's, it's weird man. It's, it's weird.

1330
01:16:34.130 --> 01:16:37.120
Like I just think if you want to change your body,

1331
01:16:37.300 --> 01:16:38.770
you want to change your physique, you want to feel better,

1332
01:16:38.771 --> 01:16:42.120
you want to feel more confident. There is a way to do that. Yes.

1333
01:16:42.220 --> 01:16:47.050
That doesn't involve paying tens of thousands of dollars or taking massive

1334
01:16:47.051 --> 01:16:50.440
health risks or getting caught up or anything like that.

1335
01:16:50.830 --> 01:16:55.660
Just go to the gym train. It works. Yes, it really,

1336
01:16:55.661 --> 01:16:59.710
it really does work. Not everyone's going to be able to reach some elite level,

1337
01:16:59.920 --> 01:17:03.580
but you know, everyone can look better, man. Everyone can look better.

1338
01:17:03.830 --> 01:17:06.850
The the people that have sympathy for people with physical deformities,

1339
01:17:07.390 --> 01:17:10.070
you know, issues that you just can't

1340
01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:13.430
<v 4>grow muscle or something's wrong with your body or you have a disease like that.</v>

1341
01:17:13.460 --> 01:17:15.470
I get it. Then for those people,

1342
01:17:15.471 --> 01:17:20.090
I do truly hope that science comes up with a solution and it's through some sort

1343
01:17:20.091 --> 01:17:24.470
of CRISPR type engineering. They're able to, here's, here's a question for you,

1344
01:17:24.471 --> 01:17:24.710
Joe.

1345
01:17:24.710 --> 01:17:29.710
Do you think that there's any sort of limit in terms of what science maybe could

1346
01:17:31.881 --> 01:17:34.970
do but sort of should not? Do you know what I mean?

1347
01:17:34.971 --> 01:17:39.680
Like as science advances and things get a little more crazy and they're looking

1348
01:17:39.681 --> 01:17:44.270
into things like making people immortal or all that kind of in your own mind,

1349
01:17:44.271 --> 01:17:47.720
do you think there's like a level where it's like maybe we should like leave

1350
01:17:47.721 --> 01:17:51.470
this alone and not go, not go that far? I don't know what you think.

1351
01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:53.500
Even if you do think that, and I,

1352
01:17:53.501 --> 01:17:56.360
I'm sure that you could find examples where I would say that's a bad idea.

1353
01:17:56.780 --> 01:18:01.040
It's not going to matter because I think that people are going to do it and if

1354
01:18:01.041 --> 01:18:03.850
the United States isn't going to do it, China's going to do it. Yeah. I mean,

1355
01:18:03.860 --> 01:18:07.660
I think China's already experimenting on people pretty cool,

1356
01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:09.890
pretty radical ways and they're doing, yeah,

1357
01:18:09.891 --> 01:18:13.090
they're doing CRISPR on fetuses and you know, they're,

1358
01:18:13.220 --> 01:18:18.110
they're going to do genetic engineering. I think it's in, you know,

1359
01:18:18.450 --> 01:18:23.270
just in the cards in our lifetime we're going to see some product of genetic

1360
01:18:23.271 --> 01:18:26.640
engineering that some super freak athlete. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean,

1361
01:18:26.760 --> 01:18:28.130
when you and I are old men,

1362
01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:31.790
we're going to be watching television or whatever the fuck they have back then

1363
01:18:31.940 --> 01:18:32.960
or in the future rather,

1364
01:18:33.230 --> 01:18:35.930
and we're going to see someone who can fucking jump over buildings.

1365
01:18:35.931 --> 01:18:40.400
We're going to see someone who can, you know, literally fly over cars,

1366
01:18:40.401 --> 01:18:44.600
just leap over things and just someone with preposterous physical attributes.

1367
01:18:44.780 --> 01:18:47.290
That's all created in a laboratory. I mean,

1368
01:18:47.320 --> 01:18:50.930
if you think about the greatest athletes the world has ever known, you know,

1369
01:18:50.931 --> 01:18:52.190
you look at like the,

1370
01:18:52.310 --> 01:18:57.310
the very best physical specimens that humanity has to offer and they just

1371
01:18:58.041 --> 01:19:01.340
figured out, okay, well what are the traits and how do we,

1372
01:19:01.400 --> 01:19:05.720
how do we impart those on people and how do we actually improve them?

1373
01:19:05.750 --> 01:19:07.790
How do we double them in triple them? You know,

1374
01:19:07.791 --> 01:19:10.550
you know what mile Staten inhibitors are a yes, I do.

1375
01:19:10.700 --> 01:19:15.700
They allow the muscle to grow far beyond what they can and they exist in,

1376
01:19:16.160 --> 01:19:18.310
um, for whatever reason, um,

1377
01:19:18.590 --> 01:19:23.150
in some cows naturally and also whippets. Yeah, bleach. It's,

1378
01:19:23.300 --> 01:19:28.160
it's really weird, so weird. I've shown people pictures and they're like,

1379
01:19:28.161 --> 01:19:30.050
that's not real. It is real.

1380
01:19:30.350 --> 01:19:33.770
Something with whippets apparently when they breed them, you know,

1381
01:19:34.250 --> 01:19:35.750
like breeding dogs is weird.

1382
01:19:35.750 --> 01:19:39.080
Like I have a friend who has a chocolate lab and their eyes are about as close

1383
01:19:39.081 --> 01:19:43.820
together as my two fingers are. That dog is fucked. Like it just, it just like,

1384
01:19:43.850 --> 01:19:47.020
I don't like being around it. It'll bite you. Like, it's a, it's,

1385
01:19:47.230 --> 01:19:51.500
it's overbred like it's like some fucking West Virginia hillbilly just left

1386
01:19:51.501 --> 01:19:52.700
alone and some small town,

1387
01:19:52.770 --> 01:19:56.270
they can't get anywhere and know there are people like that. Right. Yeah.

1388
01:19:56.630 --> 01:19:59.870
Inbred people. Well there's inbred used to be a big problem and with royalty,

1389
01:19:59.871 --> 01:20:03.620
right? Yes, yes. Yeah. Cause they only had to breed with other world to yeah.

1390
01:20:04.880 --> 01:20:05.540
Um,

1391
01:20:05.540 --> 01:20:10.540
this whatever reason when you breed whippets and something goes wrong cause

1392
01:20:11.581 --> 01:20:15.420
they're just breeding them with other whippets they develop this fucking

1393
01:20:15.540 --> 01:20:19.200
preposterous ability to grow muscle and they look like hope dogs. Yeah.

1394
01:20:19.310 --> 01:20:21.090
That's not, that's going to happen to people. Man.

1395
01:20:21.091 --> 01:20:25.800
There was already a boy who was born in Germany I believe,

1396
01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:29.040
who had a natural uh, problem.

1397
01:20:29.230 --> 01:20:32.970
He's like his body naturally had the same issue that a whip had had.

1398
01:20:33.090 --> 01:20:34.500
Have you ever been something, I think I know,

1399
01:20:34.501 --> 01:20:36.780
I'm trying to actually remember his name cause I know the kid you're talking

1400
01:20:36.781 --> 01:20:38.070
about if he can pull that up. Well,

1401
01:20:38.071 --> 01:20:41.460
there was one kid that would call them the young hall turned out that his father

1402
01:20:41.461 --> 01:20:45.390
was actually injecting with steroids when I was a little kid, which is awful.

1403
01:20:45.540 --> 01:20:50.540
But this is a boy from Germany who had this myostatin inhibitor problem and he

1404
01:20:51.691 --> 01:20:56.640
was fucking Jack. How old? He was a little, yeah,

1405
01:20:56.700 --> 01:21:00.100
like four or five at the time when I saw the pictures and I'm,

1406
01:21:00.101 --> 01:21:02.970
I'm talking just thick muscle caps, you know,

1407
01:21:03.690 --> 01:21:07.650
he looked like polo coasts. The guy who fights in the UFC fucking jacked.

1408
01:21:07.860 --> 01:21:11.140
That's nuts. Jack. Jack Little baby. That's so bad. We're going to,

1409
01:21:11.250 --> 01:21:16.250
we're going to see the Hulk and all like a real live version of the Hulk.

1410
01:21:16.650 --> 01:21:18.840
It's going to happen. I don't know that, that kind of stuff.

1411
01:21:18.870 --> 01:21:23.550
It does freak me out because it's kinda like eugenics 2.0 right. Yeah, I didn't,

1412
01:21:23.551 --> 01:21:25.110
you know, I'm just kinda like, man, well how,

1413
01:21:25.320 --> 01:21:28.650
where's this stuff all gonna all gonna go. Well,

1414
01:21:28.651 --> 01:21:33.240
there's a beauty in our diversity, like our physical diversity.

1415
01:21:33.310 --> 01:21:34.440
This is a beauty in the factors,

1416
01:21:34.500 --> 01:21:37.620
really tall people and really short people and really smart people.

1417
01:21:37.980 --> 01:21:41.370
Really stupid people. And sometimes stupid people really good at certain things.

1418
01:21:41.610 --> 01:21:45.060
Sometimes smart people are really bad at other things and there's a,

1419
01:21:45.061 --> 01:21:45.960
there's like a,

1420
01:21:46.860 --> 01:21:51.810
there's a beauty in the chaos of human life is that we are all weird and

1421
01:21:51.811 --> 01:21:55.170
different and, and if you can find your way,

1422
01:21:55.800 --> 01:21:58.830
everyone can make some sort of a contribution.

1423
01:21:59.310 --> 01:22:01.680
It's not that everyone's going to make some sort of a contribution,

1424
01:22:01.681 --> 01:22:06.681
but it's possible that most of us can find something where other people find

1425
01:22:07.681 --> 01:22:11.210
value in what you do and you could do something in an extraordinary way. Yeah,

1426
01:22:11.280 --> 01:22:11.671
definitely.

1427
01:22:11.671 --> 01:22:15.510
I think I'm a great way to stay humble is to always remember that like everybody

1428
01:22:15.511 --> 01:22:20.220
is superior superior to you in some way, shape or form, right.

1429
01:22:20.221 --> 01:22:20.580
You know you,

1430
01:22:20.580 --> 01:22:23.610
it seems like you've got people who are kind of awesome at everything or

1431
01:22:23.611 --> 01:22:24.840
whatever, but it's like, you know what,

1432
01:22:24.841 --> 01:22:27.450
like every person out there has got something that,

1433
01:22:27.451 --> 01:22:31.170
especially if they tapped into it and they actually reached some fraction of

1434
01:22:31.171 --> 01:22:32.004
their potential,

1435
01:22:32.400 --> 01:22:36.750
then people have people who are capable of all kinds of crazy things when they

1436
01:22:36.751 --> 01:22:39.630
actually do it and they train and they work on it.

1437
01:22:39.870 --> 01:22:43.140
Another perspective enhancers that the grave beckons. I mean,

1438
01:22:43.170 --> 01:22:44.070
we're all going to die.

1439
01:22:44.580 --> 01:22:48.270
They're dwelling on what you're great at or not great at in this life.

1440
01:22:48.271 --> 01:22:51.810
It's like, okay, you ain't got much time, bro. Seems like you do,

1441
01:22:51.811 --> 01:22:53.280
but it'll be there before you know it.

1442
01:22:53.310 --> 01:22:56.140
The grim Reaper is going to be knocking on your door. Yeah.

1443
01:22:56.250 --> 01:22:59.400
I think that's motivational though. There was a little bit about that kid. Yeah.

1444
01:23:00.300 --> 01:23:03.330
Yeah. She was four years old. Fucking wow.

1445
01:23:05.740 --> 01:23:06.550
Jeez.

1446
01:23:06.550 --> 01:23:09.120
<v 1>Is that the kid he does? Gymnasts think the best I could.</v>

1447
01:23:09.210 --> 01:23:13.190
I thought this is who you're talking to. You type in myostatin inhibitors. Yeah,

1448
01:23:13.220 --> 01:23:14.820
but the, I don't know if it's coming up on him.

1449
01:23:14.821 --> 01:23:17.250
I don't know if they have studies on him, but I don't know if that's him.

1450
01:23:18.080 --> 01:23:22.600
He's Jack though. He's fucked. He's so jacked.

1451
01:23:23.100 --> 01:23:28.100
He's four years old and he's built like a 17 year old super dude.

1452
01:23:28.201 --> 01:23:32.410
Look at the who got the shit? Yeah, the shoulder striations. Yeah.

1453
01:23:32.850 --> 01:23:36.240
That is so unusual. No, that's not normal. No. So unusual.

1454
01:23:36.450 --> 01:23:40.260
That guy's gonna fuck his way through grammar school. That's not normal.

1455
01:23:41.580 --> 01:23:45.800
Big tank. Yeah.

1456
01:23:45.810 --> 01:23:46.980
We're going to see a lot of those.

1457
01:23:47.190 --> 01:23:51.390
We're going to see a lot of those coming out of China or my words, you know,

1458
01:23:51.580 --> 01:23:53.980
he's not that big anymore. It's not the beginning of the older now.

1459
01:23:53.980 --> 01:23:57.700
That's him now. Oh, okay. What happened? They stop lifting weights.

1460
01:23:58.150 --> 01:24:01.780
They got him off the ship. 15 now maybe see when I see something like that.

1461
01:24:01.781 --> 01:24:03.520
And then I also see him lifting weights. He's younger.

1462
01:24:03.521 --> 01:24:07.180
I don't think this is the same one. And cause that was also, he's Italian,

1463
01:24:07.330 --> 01:24:11.080
right? A Romanian. Romanian, yeah. Um,

1464
01:24:11.590 --> 01:24:13.870
there's another kid from Michigan, which he said Germany.

1465
01:24:13.871 --> 01:24:17.170
So I thought it was a German kid. Yeah, I know what you're talking about.

1466
01:24:17.171 --> 01:24:20.440
But we could search for a long time before we find it and interrupt.

1467
01:24:20.441 --> 01:24:24.610
The podcast will never get done. But uh, I think we're going to see that.

1468
01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:26.920
I think to answer your question though, yeah,

1469
01:24:26.921 --> 01:24:30.160
I think there's probably a lot of things that we shouldn't do, you know,

1470
01:24:30.161 --> 01:24:34.990
but what are those things and whose to decide and does it really matter? I mean,

1471
01:24:36.640 --> 01:24:36.851
look,

1472
01:24:36.851 --> 01:24:39.820
it's entirely possible that this fucking plan is going to get hit within our

1473
01:24:39.821 --> 01:24:43.210
lifetime by a giant asteroid and we're gonna wipe us all out possible.

1474
01:24:43.330 --> 01:24:46.300
That's possible. It's possible. That's not outside the realm. No,

1475
01:24:46.480 --> 01:24:48.190
I mean this isn't there a big one. It's supposed to,

1476
01:24:48.520 --> 01:24:52.720
there's a real chance it might hit around 2029 fuck,

1477
01:24:52.840 --> 01:24:56.140
I thought we were all supposed to be marked by in 2000 or so, but I dunno,

1478
01:24:56.320 --> 01:24:57.800
that was just the Y to cash.

1479
01:24:58.600 --> 01:25:02.080
That was just the bug was gonna stop civilization in its tracks.

1480
01:25:02.670 --> 01:25:05.260
I can Alaris is that when they were coding,

1481
01:25:05.440 --> 01:25:09.280
they didn't take into account that the 19 hundreds going to switch over to the

1482
01:25:09.281 --> 01:25:13.660
two thousands I remember even even at that time when I was a lot younger and I

1483
01:25:13.661 --> 01:25:16.750
was thinking surely they worked that out.

1484
01:25:16.840 --> 01:25:20.230
Like surely it'll just go from 99 to zero. They're not,

1485
01:25:20.290 --> 01:25:22.870
it's not going to just explode. And they call us all this guy.

1486
01:25:22.900 --> 01:25:26.140
They worked it out and you had people like hiding underground and doomsday

1487
01:25:26.141 --> 01:25:26.974
prepping and all that.

1488
01:25:27.010 --> 01:25:30.490
Oh imagine if you spent all your money building a bunker in your backyard and

1489
01:25:30.491 --> 01:25:35.280
then the day after 2000 poke your head out and birds are chirping people

1490
01:25:35.890 --> 01:25:40.090
driving. Hi Mike. Hey Cindy. Fucking normal.

1491
01:25:40.510 --> 01:25:44.980
You definitely a shit bunker. Go to stay in there to stay safe face.

1492
01:25:45.100 --> 01:25:49.420
Yeah. Yeah. I mean look, people are fucking silly,

1493
01:25:49.450 --> 01:25:53.290
but we all, we all have this understanding, this appreciation,

1494
01:25:53.291 --> 01:25:57.610
the fact that we, you know, civilization like our grid,

1495
01:25:57.611 --> 01:26:01.180
our power grid is fragile, the internet is fragile. There's no fucking,

1496
01:26:01.390 --> 01:26:04.340
there's wires that go under the ocean that connect

1497
01:26:04.340 --> 01:26:06.920
<v 4>us to other countries. That's how it works. Yup.</v>

1498
01:26:07.130 --> 01:26:11.570
The internet is literally wires laid down at the bottom of the ocean that

1499
01:26:11.960 --> 01:26:12.740
connect us with Europe.

1500
01:26:12.740 --> 01:26:17.210
<v 7>Yeah, it's nuts. It's crazy how quickly it's, how quickly it's happened as well.</v>

1501
01:26:17.260 --> 01:26:18.560
I know, it's interesting with me,

1502
01:26:18.561 --> 01:26:23.330
I mean I was born 86 and I remember in,

1503
01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:27.950
you know, the late eighties when you couldn't even render a circle on a screen,

1504
01:26:28.700 --> 01:26:31.550
right? Like they didn't have the technology to make an actual circle.

1505
01:26:31.551 --> 01:26:33.710
So in all the video games and graphics and stuff,

1506
01:26:33.711 --> 01:26:37.370
it would either be a square or at best a hexagon or an octagon because you

1507
01:26:37.371 --> 01:26:41.780
couldn't actually do round curves. And that's in my own lifetime.

1508
01:26:41.810 --> 01:26:45.770
And then I remember, I remember the early days of the internet when I was,

1509
01:26:45.860 --> 01:26:49.760
especially when I was in boarding school and stuff and using geo cities and

1510
01:26:49.761 --> 01:26:51.650
Netscape and all that kind of stuff.

1511
01:26:51.651 --> 01:26:56.651
And it's just kinda crazy how it's gone from that and all these Atari 2,600 and

1512
01:26:56.661 --> 01:26:59.480
these very basic video games and stuff like that.

1513
01:26:59.480 --> 01:27:03.380
And the Apple two ease with the big floppy disks and all that stuff.

1514
01:27:03.381 --> 01:27:06.800
And I'm just like, man, I'm only, I mean I just turned 33 and I'm like, man,

1515
01:27:06.890 --> 01:27:09.470
that's just in my own lifetime.

1516
01:27:09.620 --> 01:27:14.600
So in another 10 20, 30 years, it's,

1517
01:27:14.870 --> 01:27:15.260
yeah,

1518
01:27:15.260 --> 01:27:18.170
it's amazing to just think of what stuff's going to be like cause they'll look

1519
01:27:18.171 --> 01:27:20.570
back on what we have now and what we have.

1520
01:27:20.600 --> 01:27:25.600
Everything we have now is going to look like the Atari 2,600 those to me right

1521
01:27:26.931 --> 01:27:29.360
now, there'll be looking at these phones and being like, Oh my gosh,

1522
01:27:29.361 --> 01:27:31.490
people used to use this. It's inevitable. Yeah.

1523
01:27:32.030 --> 01:27:33.260
You know what's interesting is that there's,

1524
01:27:33.760 --> 01:27:38.760
there's nothing classic from our lifetime either classic classic like uh,

1525
01:27:41.170 --> 01:27:41.900
like there's

1526
01:27:41.900 --> 01:27:44.300
<v 4>classic things from like the night,</v>

1527
01:27:44.301 --> 01:27:47.630
like classic muscle cars for example from the 1960s people love them.

1528
01:27:47.840 --> 01:27:50.870
Classic cars from the nineties can go fuck themselves. No,

1529
01:27:52.040 --> 01:27:54.860
nobody wants a 1990 car. Get the fuck outta here.

1530
01:27:54.861 --> 01:27:57.710
With that already classic by like the 80s though,

1531
01:27:57.740 --> 01:28:02.630
like classic rock was already classic run. It happened quick. Yeah.

1532
01:28:03.020 --> 01:28:04.850
Well people realize that something had happened.

1533
01:28:05.150 --> 01:28:10.150
There was this like this blip in time where people went wild and they,

1534
01:28:10.550 --> 01:28:12.230
you know, we talked about it with Aoki yesterday.

1535
01:28:12.280 --> 01:28:15.090
We were talking about Hendrix and Janis Joplin and Jim Morrison.

1536
01:28:15.150 --> 01:28:18.950
These people just were a part of this revolutionary change in culture.

1537
01:28:18.951 --> 01:28:23.270
And then it was swiped out in the 1970s so by the time 1980s came around,

1538
01:28:23.271 --> 01:28:24.290
when I was in high school,

1539
01:28:24.680 --> 01:28:28.730
1970 cars were fucking classic cars.

1540
01:28:29.150 --> 01:28:30.280
They were classic Malaga,

1541
01:28:30.310 --> 01:28:35.300
1970 Chevelle in 1981 when I was 14 was the shit.

1542
01:28:35.870 --> 01:28:40.250
It was like a classic muscle car. Like my mom had a 1970 Barracuda,

1543
01:28:40.280 --> 01:28:45.050
1971 Barracuda when I was 14 in 1981 that was the shit.

1544
01:28:45.200 --> 01:28:49.160
But it was a classic car was an old car, but it was 10 years old. Okay.

1545
01:28:49.430 --> 01:28:54.430
It's like we realized some way that the culture had shifted and that was never

1546
01:28:55.230 --> 01:28:58.670
gonna happen again because cars were dog shit in the 80s I mean,

1547
01:28:58.671 --> 01:29:00.830
they were just dogs. If you didn't have a Porsche,

1548
01:29:00.960 --> 01:29:03.570
Porsche is probably the only cars that are still cool.

1549
01:29:03.720 --> 01:29:07.050
Like I have a 1993 RS America.

1550
01:29:07.410 --> 01:29:11.130
It's a very lightweight air cooled Porsche, super lightweight,

1551
01:29:11.490 --> 01:29:15.720
stripped down, no air conditioning, no radio. It's a fun car.

1552
01:29:15.721 --> 01:29:18.030
And so I was like one of the rare cars,

1553
01:29:18.150 --> 01:29:21.270
it's worth a fuck from 1990s one of the rare ones. Yeah.

1554
01:29:21.390 --> 01:29:25.200
Most of the shit from that era is just nonsense. You know,

1555
01:29:25.201 --> 01:29:28.980
for whatever reason they just, the eighties and nineties like people just said,

1556
01:29:29.580 --> 01:29:33.240
they went into this dulled zone of creativity. A lot of complaints,

1557
01:29:33.241 --> 01:29:35.640
a lot of things. Classic video games though, I guess music,

1558
01:29:35.700 --> 01:29:39.930
music and video games. Entertainment. Yeah. Music films, comedy, comedy. No,

1559
01:29:40.050 --> 01:29:43.110
that was Eddie Murphy. Delirious was from the 80s yeah.

1560
01:29:43.111 --> 01:29:45.540
A lot of Richard Pryor shit was from the 80s it was amazing.

1561
01:29:45.640 --> 01:29:48.480
Maybe not in terms of um, tech or manufacturing,

1562
01:29:49.020 --> 01:29:51.900
but in entertainment I think entertainment and culture,

1563
01:29:51.901 --> 01:29:54.540
I think some key stuff happened in that decade. Well,

1564
01:29:54.541 --> 01:29:59.541
there's these bursts of novelty in the creativity and we're certainly in the

1565
01:30:00.361 --> 01:30:01.350
middle of one right now.

1566
01:30:02.190 --> 01:30:06.300
Like right now is probably one of the more interesting times to be alive in

1567
01:30:06.301 --> 01:30:09.450
terms of like constant innovation. And new things being created.

1568
01:30:09.840 --> 01:30:12.150
Apple has apparently some new AR glasses.

1569
01:30:12.151 --> 01:30:14.810
They're about to release augmented reality glasses. Yeah.

1570
01:30:14.940 --> 01:30:19.230
I also just think now the time we live is people just have the opportunity and

1571
01:30:19.231 --> 01:30:24.060
potential and power people have as individuals now is insane. Yeah.

1572
01:30:24.240 --> 01:30:26.520
It's, it's not what it's ever been before. I mean,

1573
01:30:26.940 --> 01:30:30.200
nobody told you to start this podcast, right. This is just something you,

1574
01:30:30.480 --> 01:30:32.130
you started and you've been doing it.

1575
01:30:32.131 --> 01:30:34.290
You've been doing it now for a decade plus,

1576
01:30:34.740 --> 01:30:38.030
and you've got the ability to broadcast this out to millions of people.

1577
01:30:38.050 --> 01:30:40.410
Doesn't matter where they are in the world. I mean, I live in the UK.

1578
01:30:40.411 --> 01:30:44.460
I flew over here to come do this podcast and I've had people in the UK. Oh,

1579
01:30:44.461 --> 01:30:47.550
cool. Awesome. You're going on Joe Rogan. Yeah. I watched that and it's like,

1580
01:30:47.551 --> 01:30:51.150
that's thousands of miles away and you've got people all over and you can reach

1581
01:30:51.151 --> 01:30:54.090
all of them largely for free too. Right. You can just do that.

1582
01:30:54.091 --> 01:30:55.170
You can put something out on your phone,

1583
01:30:55.171 --> 01:30:56.700
you can reach millions of people through their,

1584
01:30:56.701 --> 01:30:58.230
whatever it is you're trying to communicate,

1585
01:30:58.500 --> 01:31:00.570
whatever it is you're trying to promote. I mean, that's you.

1586
01:31:00.810 --> 01:31:03.130
That's what I really enjoy. The fact that it's free. Yeah.

1587
01:31:03.240 --> 01:31:06.030
I think that's the coolest aspect of one of the,

1588
01:31:06.090 --> 01:31:10.230
the big media things today, which are podcasts,

1589
01:31:10.260 --> 01:31:13.710
is that you can just get them. It's just like, I download so many of them, man,

1590
01:31:13.711 --> 01:31:17.490
I get 'em all the time and they're there. They're always new ones.

1591
01:31:17.491 --> 01:31:19.620
They're always available and you get them.

1592
01:31:19.860 --> 01:31:22.510
I love the fact that you can get them instantly to, yeah,

1593
01:31:23.010 --> 01:31:26.440
you have a podcast on it, a real talk with Zubi real talk with Zuby. He'll talk.

1594
01:31:26.460 --> 01:31:30.750
So I can go right now to my iTunes and I'll type in right here and here we are.

1595
01:31:31.080 --> 01:31:31.561
We guard.

1596
01:31:31.561 --> 01:31:36.180
There we are in the podcast app and we're going to go with real talk with Zubi

1597
01:31:36.210 --> 01:31:40.440
talk with Z. You there it is. Bam.

1598
01:31:40.610 --> 01:31:43.200
Real talk with Zubi. Here it is. Boom. Cause,

1599
01:31:43.430 --> 01:31:46.920
and I'm a subscribe and then I'm gonna see, Ooh, check Mark.

1600
01:31:46.921 --> 01:31:51.270
And that's a downlow Casa. Awesome. Everybody else go do the same right now.

1601
01:31:51.271 --> 01:31:52.590
Everybody goes through the same of this.

1602
01:31:53.160 --> 01:31:56.610
I mean this is what's crazy is it's not like instantaneously play it.

1603
01:31:56.880 --> 01:31:59.990
I mean we're having this conversation by benign. I mean you can.

1604
01:31:59.990 --> 01:32:01.240
<v 2>There we go. That's crazy.</v>

1605
01:32:01.241 --> 01:32:06.070
My shout up that that's the most amazing thing in our lifetime.

1606
01:32:06.071 --> 01:32:09.790
It is. Yeah. You just pulled that out of the air. This thing is like in the air,

1607
01:32:10.180 --> 01:32:14.550
it's not connected to shit and it's just pulling things out of the sky with a,

1608
01:32:14.560 --> 01:32:19.300
you know, it's not, I feel like people are aware of it, but they're kind of not.

1609
01:32:19.780 --> 01:32:21.670
Most people are not. Do you know what I mean?

1610
01:32:21.671 --> 01:32:24.700
Like people that are our PE people, people use it.

1611
01:32:24.701 --> 01:32:27.040
Everybody knows the internet exists. Everyone knows social media is there.

1612
01:32:27.310 --> 01:32:31.240
I don't think people realize like what you can really do with those tools.

1613
01:32:31.241 --> 01:32:31.601
It's like, yeah,

1614
01:32:31.601 --> 01:32:36.190
you can sit there on Twitter and be mean to people in Detroit and troll and

1615
01:32:36.191 --> 01:32:39.790
troll and go on YouTube and write mean comments or whatever. You can do that,

1616
01:32:40.060 --> 01:32:43.930
but you can also just create something from nothing. Right?

1617
01:32:43.931 --> 01:32:47.350
If you're a comedian, you're a musician, you're an actor or whatever,

1618
01:32:47.351 --> 01:32:49.870
you can just go and make a YouTube channel, create new channel,

1619
01:32:49.900 --> 01:32:53.050
create new account. Yeah. And you can just start putting stuff out there.

1620
01:32:53.051 --> 01:32:57.670
You've got a phone which can record in HD four K video. Good audio.

1621
01:32:57.970 --> 01:32:58.481
I mean it's nuts.

1622
01:32:58.481 --> 01:33:03.481
Even if I just go back to the 90s or early thousands and you look at music

1623
01:33:04.031 --> 01:33:05.140
videos and stuff like that,

1624
01:33:05.650 --> 01:33:10.650
and an iPhone or a standard Android can record better quality video than the top

1625
01:33:12.491 --> 01:33:16.210
tier stuff that they were recording music videos and films with not so long ago.

1626
01:33:16.211 --> 01:33:18.250
And it's just like, man, that's just in your pocket. Oh.

1627
01:33:18.251 --> 01:33:21.580
Especially the new Androids like the galaxy note 10 yeah.

1628
01:33:21.820 --> 01:33:26.410
Has the ability to blur the background, like portrait mode in four K video.

1629
01:33:26.680 --> 01:33:29.540
So you're making four K video, not just blurred,

1630
01:33:29.560 --> 01:33:34.060
but they also have this filter that you can make the background kind of fucked

1631
01:33:34.061 --> 01:33:36.640
up and scratchy like an old VHS tape. Okay.

1632
01:33:36.670 --> 01:33:41.440
You could do cool effects with video while in real time.

1633
01:33:41.470 --> 01:33:41.830
Yeah.

1634
01:33:41.830 --> 01:33:46.830
I mean they also have wide angle lenses so you can film and take photos and wide

1635
01:33:46.901 --> 01:33:47.321
angle.

1636
01:33:47.321 --> 01:33:51.820
They have night vision mode where it turns night into I'm a much more visible

1637
01:33:51.821 --> 01:33:55.780
environment. It's, it's weird. It's weird and it's still early.

1638
01:33:55.940 --> 01:33:57.910
That's the crazy thing is that it's still early.

1639
01:33:57.940 --> 01:33:59.740
I love the fact that we're all competing with each other, right?

1640
01:33:59.741 --> 01:34:03.840
Like Apple has to come up with something better than Samsung's done and Huawei

1641
01:34:03.850 --> 01:34:05.020
and you know, one plus,

1642
01:34:05.021 --> 01:34:09.970
it's like it's this mad dash to come up with the greatest shit the world's ever

1643
01:34:09.971 --> 01:34:11.260
seen. Everyone's doing it.

1644
01:34:11.290 --> 01:34:14.530
I do think that it would be good to have a little bit of a moratorium on new

1645
01:34:14.531 --> 01:34:18.940
phones though. Really? Why? Oh, they won't do it, but I never, no,

1646
01:34:18.941 --> 01:34:21.130
of course not. Of course not. They want to keep the competition going,

1647
01:34:21.131 --> 01:34:25.660
keep people fired up. But the differences between them now are so incremental.

1648
01:34:25.690 --> 01:34:29.230
It's just diminishing returns now. So you know,

1649
01:34:29.231 --> 01:34:31.870
if he put out a new phone every six months or every 12 months,

1650
01:34:31.900 --> 01:34:35.710
the difference between them now is kinda like sort of,

1651
01:34:36.130 --> 01:34:40.180
but the difference between like if you look at like the screen real estate of

1652
01:34:40.181 --> 01:34:44.850
like a galaxy note 10 versus an iPod, iPhone 10 which is what I have. But yeah,

1653
01:34:44.920 --> 01:34:47.440
10 S max. Okay.

1654
01:34:47.470 --> 01:34:51.010
That was the shit just a few months ago. Yeah.

1655
01:34:51.040 --> 01:34:54.760
But when you look at that next to like Steve Aoki was here yesterday and he had

1656
01:34:54.761 --> 01:34:58.010
a galaxyS 10 plus. Is that what it was?

1657
01:34:58.670 --> 01:35:01.190
<v 4>That thing looks way cooler than this. Like you were looking at.</v>

1658
01:35:01.250 --> 01:35:03.080
I'm right next to each other like, Oh there's no,

1659
01:35:03.380 --> 01:35:07.550
there's no bezels on the outside and there no notch at the top. Yeah.

1660
01:35:07.670 --> 01:35:11.140
This is a tiny little hole where the camera is. I'm like, Oh yeah. What?

1661
01:35:11.170 --> 01:35:15.220
I guess what I mean is like the difference between the galaxyS five and the E

1662
01:35:15.220 --> 01:35:17.350
ssex edge was like a big leap. Right.

1663
01:35:17.570 --> 01:35:21.050
And then between the six and the seven,

1664
01:35:21.500 --> 01:35:25.760
little less between the seven and the S eight little less. I mean, between you,

1665
01:35:25.761 --> 01:35:28.760
what do you got over there? What do you use? This is a one plus six. Oh,

1666
01:35:28.761 --> 01:35:32.270
well I'll give them a much, give them a shout out. Um, that's a great phone.

1667
01:35:32.360 --> 01:35:35.720
One plus makes a great phone as sort of unheralded phone and they have the very

1668
01:35:35.721 --> 01:35:38.900
best in screen fingerprint reader apparently. Yeah.

1669
01:35:38.901 --> 01:35:42.730
So shout out to Flossy Carter teaching me. Yeah.

1670
01:35:42.740 --> 01:35:46.910
So they've made three new ones since this version.

1671
01:35:46.911 --> 01:35:50.090
I only got this last year, but this is already three generations.

1672
01:35:50.270 --> 01:35:54.350
Let me see that. And that's pretty fucking cool. The new ones plus seven,

1673
01:35:54.770 --> 01:35:58.760
the one plus seven has a, a full screens.

1674
01:35:58.820 --> 01:36:00.560
I've got Megatron on the back today. Oh, nice.

1675
01:36:00.780 --> 01:36:04.100
The one plus seven has a full screen. There's no notch at all.

1676
01:36:04.101 --> 01:36:07.460
There's nothing about camera. Camera go and a little motor. Yeah.

1677
01:36:07.910 --> 01:36:09.170
Which is pretty incredible. Yeah.

1678
01:36:09.230 --> 01:36:11.420
A lot of people here don't seem to know one plus. No.

1679
01:36:11.450 --> 01:36:15.800
Everyone seems confused by my phone here. Right. That's everybody's Apple.

1680
01:36:15.801 --> 01:36:19.460
Crazy. Okay. Okay. It's everyone's locked into the ecosystem. Okay.

1681
01:36:19.710 --> 01:36:23.510
Apple has done an amazing job of roping everybody into their ecosystem.

1682
01:36:23.511 --> 01:36:26.390
100% with iMessage and with airdrop. Okay.

1683
01:36:26.420 --> 01:36:29.810
Those two things and FaceTime and FaceTime. We're thing over here.

1684
01:36:29.811 --> 01:36:31.940
Everybody FaceTimes people is a new thing.

1685
01:36:31.941 --> 01:36:34.920
Like I got FaceTime calls from my friends. I just FaceTime me out of the blue.

1686
01:36:37.020 --> 01:36:38.460
I'm like, all right guys,

1687
01:36:38.550 --> 01:36:42.230
we're going to talk on video and then they're there and then your video too,

1688
01:36:42.680 --> 01:36:44.450
like the first one to do it to me was killer Mike.

1689
01:36:44.451 --> 01:36:48.200
I was taking a shit and killer Mike FaceTimes me. I'm like, what's up man?

1690
01:36:50.220 --> 01:36:53.130
But apparently kids would do it. Andrew Schultz does it. A lot of,

1691
01:36:53.150 --> 01:36:56.480
a lot of people just FaceTime people now. That's the new thing. Yeah.

1692
01:36:56.630 --> 01:36:57.740
People are into FaceTiming.

1693
01:36:58.340 --> 01:37:02.150
Schulz is an interesting example because he's a God that couldn't get a Netflix

1694
01:37:02.151 --> 01:37:06.110
deal, couldn't get a comedy central deal, so he said, okay, I know what I'll do.

1695
01:37:06.380 --> 01:37:07.850
I know I've got great comedy.

1696
01:37:07.880 --> 01:37:11.810
I will just put it all on YouTube and he created this YouTube channel.

1697
01:37:12.020 --> 01:37:14.510
He put his, his stand up comedy special.

1698
01:37:14.511 --> 01:37:16.460
He was self-produced it paid for everything,

1699
01:37:16.461 --> 01:37:21.461
put it up on YouTube and it's got millions of views and he went from being a guy

1700
01:37:21.651 --> 01:37:25.790
that didn't really sell out clubs all that often to selling out theaters,

1701
01:37:25.850 --> 01:37:29.540
multiple shows, and it happened inside of a year. Yeah,

1702
01:37:29.600 --> 01:37:31.370
just all self-made,

1703
01:37:31.610 --> 01:37:34.640
all done by himself with the people that he works with,

1704
01:37:35.420 --> 01:37:38.090
he puts little clips on his Instagram, they get hyped up,

1705
01:37:38.330 --> 01:37:40.250
he promotes them that way.

1706
01:37:40.251 --> 01:37:44.540
He puts clips on YouTube and now other comics are following suit and they're

1707
01:37:44.541 --> 01:37:46.970
realizing like, Hey, this is the way to do this.

1708
01:37:46.971 --> 01:37:50.110
And so many people can watch YouTube on their television now. Oh yeah,

1709
01:37:50.120 --> 01:37:53.900
of course. Yeah. Just the opportunity out there right now is, is incredible.

1710
01:37:53.980 --> 01:37:56.160
Yeah, it's incredible. I, I posted a dumb

1711
01:37:56.160 --> 01:37:58.980
<v 7>nine second video on Twitter and you know,</v>

1712
01:37:58.981 --> 01:38:02.040
got international international coverage on it.

1713
01:38:02.041 --> 01:38:04.920
I've been invited to fly out to LA. I'm now on, you know,

1714
01:38:04.921 --> 01:38:09.330
the Joe Rogan experience doing all these other podcasts and it's just,

1715
01:38:09.930 --> 01:38:13.200
it's just nuts, you know? And you can't eat for that. Oh, of course. Yeah.

1716
01:38:13.650 --> 01:38:18.150
What do people say? Well, 99.5% was positive.

1717
01:38:18.270 --> 01:38:21.570
Most people got it. Um, the people who were angry,

1718
01:38:22.110 --> 01:38:26.400
it was kind of funny because people were angry for different reasons because a

1719
01:38:26.401 --> 01:38:29.040
lot of people didn't get it. So I don't want to say a lot of people,

1720
01:38:29.041 --> 01:38:29.970
a few people didn't get it.

1721
01:38:30.240 --> 01:38:34.830
So some people were upset with me saying that what I did who was not fair

1722
01:38:34.831 --> 01:38:35.664
towards women.

1723
01:38:38.580 --> 01:38:40.740
It's kind of like you kind of got the point,

1724
01:38:40.741 --> 01:38:43.950
but you also sort of usually missed it know. So I got some people saying that,

1725
01:38:43.951 --> 01:38:47.370
Oh, you know, you're not a real woman and you shouldn't be doing this.

1726
01:38:47.371 --> 01:38:50.910
What you did was unfair against women and blah, blah, blah, ditch tenders.

1727
01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:54.600
I'm kinda like, dude, you're always gonna have people that need,

1728
01:38:54.601 --> 01:38:59.450
you need them to dig holes. Yeah. Yeah. And that did not gonna get it. And that,

1729
01:38:59.451 --> 01:39:02.130
and then of course there were the people who were trying to say that it was some

1730
01:39:02.160 --> 01:39:06.570
attack on trans people as a whole or the entire trans community or something,

1731
01:39:06.870 --> 01:39:09.570
something like this. And it was just like, no,

1732
01:39:09.600 --> 01:39:14.190
it's just making a very biological, factual point.

1733
01:39:14.220 --> 01:39:18.240
This is not an attack on any individual nor group. And like you said,

1734
01:39:18.241 --> 01:39:19.200
I mean online, once we had,

1735
01:39:19.201 --> 01:39:24.201
as people try to read malice and stuff into things that's not there,

1736
01:39:24.780 --> 01:39:28.050
someone will see one tweet and they'll start coming up with all these weird

1737
01:39:28.051 --> 01:39:31.650
assumptions about what you believe or what they think you are or whatever,

1738
01:39:31.651 --> 01:39:35.520
and you're just like, no, that's not what I said. That's not what I believe.

1739
01:39:35.940 --> 01:39:37.810
I just said what I said. I did what I did.

1740
01:39:38.090 --> 01:39:39.870
One of the interesting things about tweets, right,

1741
01:39:39.871 --> 01:39:42.990
is that if you can define someone in 140 characters,

1742
01:39:42.991 --> 01:39:46.380
I'm pegging it moron who's this and that and boom. Yeah.

1743
01:39:46.410 --> 01:39:49.500
And then you send that tweet out there and then you know, you read it and like,

1744
01:39:49.630 --> 01:39:51.390
Hey, that's not me. No, but it's,

1745
01:39:51.570 --> 01:39:55.860
these mischaracterizations are so easy when there's 140 characters or 280

1746
01:39:56.280 --> 01:39:57.780
characters. A lot of it is malice too. You know,

1747
01:39:57.781 --> 01:40:01.230
if people don't understand something or something goes against their beliefs or

1748
01:40:01.231 --> 01:40:01.951
their ideology,

1749
01:40:01.951 --> 01:40:06.150
it's a lot easier to just try to demonize the person who's saying it or slap

1750
01:40:06.151 --> 01:40:09.900
some kind of label on them, which means that you can just ignore that person.

1751
01:40:09.901 --> 01:40:13.470
Right? Yeah. It's, people tried to do it all the time.

1752
01:40:13.471 --> 01:40:16.860
It's not something that works with me because I'm very aware and cognizant of

1753
01:40:16.861 --> 01:40:20.190
these types of tactics and stuff people try to use to mob people or shut them

1754
01:40:20.191 --> 01:40:22.950
down or whatever. So it doesn't work on me personally.

1755
01:40:22.980 --> 01:40:26.830
Like I've had tons of mobs come after me and try to, you know,

1756
01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:30.330
label me some shit. They're reasonable. Yeah.

1757
01:40:31.200 --> 01:40:32.090
This is the thing that just,

1758
01:40:32.091 --> 01:40:35.700
it just doesn't work because I don't play into the game.

1759
01:40:35.900 --> 01:40:38.430
Like they just ended up looking silly cause they'll say something and you're

1760
01:40:38.431 --> 01:40:39.264
just like, no.

1761
01:40:39.450 --> 01:40:43.980
Well you've got your finger on the pulse of culture and all these shifting tides

1762
01:40:43.981 --> 01:40:46.050
and turns. Where do you think this is going?

1763
01:40:46.470 --> 01:40:50.100
Because this is not something that we experienced 10 15 years ago. This is,

1764
01:40:50.160 --> 01:40:54.820
this is all like the boiling is completely new.

1765
01:40:54.870 --> 01:40:58.000
Yeah. You, where do you think this is going? That's a good question.

1766
01:40:58.001 --> 01:41:00.820
I is like a particular aspect of it.

1767
01:41:00.850 --> 01:41:05.380
Do you mean the political stuff or the animosity for sure.

1768
01:41:05.381 --> 01:41:07.270
Because it seems heightened. It is heightened.

1769
01:41:07.271 --> 01:41:12.271
It seems more people are particularly politically more polarized now than ever

1770
01:41:12.401 --> 01:41:13.234
before.

1771
01:41:13.240 --> 01:41:18.240
The quickest I've ever seen for people to label someone a bigot or a racist or a

1772
01:41:18.791 --> 01:41:21.460
trans folk or a sexist.

1773
01:41:21.461 --> 01:41:23.800
It's like everyone wa there's,

1774
01:41:24.010 --> 01:41:29.010
there's so much intensity involved in discourse today that I attribute some of

1775
01:41:30.130 --> 01:41:34.990
it to the dismay of having a maniac in the white house, you know? Well,

1776
01:41:35.320 --> 01:41:38.530
he's into that. He's more of a symptom than a cause.

1777
01:41:39.190 --> 01:41:42.100
It was already happening and I'd already seen it happening. Yeah.

1778
01:41:42.160 --> 01:41:47.120
So that's a big reason why he won as far as I'm concerned. Um,

1779
01:41:47.170 --> 01:41:50.770
because people were getting tired of some of the nonsense, you know,

1780
01:41:50.771 --> 01:41:53.930
people are getting tired of, I often joke, I mean it,

1781
01:41:54.730 --> 01:41:59.080
it seems like in 2015 and 2016 the, the strategy of, you know,

1782
01:41:59.170 --> 01:42:03.280
some of the democratic party was to call half the population racist and that

1783
01:42:03.281 --> 01:42:04.000
didn't work.

1784
01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:07.390
So now they're strategies to call 70% of the population racist and hope it works

1785
01:42:07.900 --> 01:42:08.733
and

1786
01:42:11.950 --> 01:42:13.120
it doesn't work.

1787
01:42:13.120 --> 01:42:17.500
I mean it doesn't endear people to you if you're trying to win people over then

1788
01:42:17.530 --> 01:42:21.280
trying to call them things that are not is really not a good idea.

1789
01:42:21.281 --> 01:42:25.120
And a big problem with it as well is one, it dilutes the terms, right?

1790
01:42:25.121 --> 01:42:26.770
When people start throwing around these terms,

1791
01:42:26.771 --> 01:42:31.000
racist Nazi white supremacists are diluted the terms completely because if you

1792
01:42:31.001 --> 01:42:35.380
start with Apple and Google a, which one are they called? Ben Shapiro,

1793
01:42:36.190 --> 01:42:41.080
who's a Jew, an Orthodox Jew, they call two Orthodox Jew or one of those.

1794
01:42:41.440 --> 01:42:43.930
And uh, Dennis Prager was also Jewish.

1795
01:42:43.931 --> 01:42:48.460
They labeled them an internal memos as Nazis. It's insane. Nazi.

1796
01:42:48.461 --> 01:42:52.340
It's crazy. Yeah. I've been called a Nazi. Woo. I'm a young black man. Um,

1797
01:42:52.750 --> 01:42:54.730
I'll be called a white two. I'm being called a black white supremacist.

1798
01:42:55.300 --> 01:42:57.620
I'm not even joking. [inaudible] yeah,

1799
01:42:57.880 --> 01:43:00.610
so like Clayton Bigsby from Chappelle show.

1800
01:43:01.520 --> 01:43:03.250
I wish I were joking.

1801
01:43:03.450 --> 01:43:06.040
I'm best thing is like three of the people who have called me that were white

1802
01:43:06.050 --> 01:43:10.120
too. So I was just like, you can see the ridiculousness of what you're,

1803
01:43:10.180 --> 01:43:11.020
what you're saying here.

1804
01:43:11.050 --> 01:43:14.980
So people just throw around these labels and I think there's a problem for a lot

1805
01:43:14.981 --> 01:43:15.850
of reasons. I think one,

1806
01:43:15.851 --> 01:43:20.851
it massively minimises the reality of people who have actually gone through some

1807
01:43:22.091 --> 01:43:24.250
crap or been oppressed or something like that.

1808
01:43:24.251 --> 01:43:26.470
If you start just tossing these things around,

1809
01:43:26.471 --> 01:43:29.710
if you start comparing stuff to Nazi Germany or whatever,

1810
01:43:30.640 --> 01:43:33.910
the people who genuinely went through that stuff will be like, wait,

1811
01:43:33.911 --> 01:43:37.930
what are you even talking about? Right? That's not fair. Number two is it just,

1812
01:43:38.410 --> 01:43:41.950
um, it makes it really hard to actually,

1813
01:43:43.420 --> 01:43:45.340
what's the time it sort of dilutes the terms.

1814
01:43:45.700 --> 01:43:49.480
So things that should have a sting lose their sting.

1815
01:43:49.481 --> 01:43:51.160
If you're going to just call everybody racist,

1816
01:43:51.170 --> 01:43:52.700
you're gonna call everybody a white supremist,

1817
01:43:52.701 --> 01:43:54.260
you're going to call everybody these things,

1818
01:43:54.650 --> 01:43:58.040
then it [inaudible] these words lose their power. And then third,

1819
01:43:58.100 --> 01:44:02.870
it actually provides cover for genuine people who hold these views,

1820
01:44:02.900 --> 01:44:06.800
right? Like white supremacists, not some big popular common thing,

1821
01:44:07.100 --> 01:44:10.880
but you know, those people do still exist. Neo Nazis do actually exist.

1822
01:44:11.180 --> 01:44:13.010
And you're providing massive cover for them all.

1823
01:44:13.160 --> 01:44:16.790
If you're going to just start going around and banding out these terms, what,

1824
01:44:16.791 --> 01:44:20.720
like Willy nilly, because now when people hear those terms, if you hear, Oh,

1825
01:44:20.721 --> 01:44:24.590
so and so is called a Nazi, now my default that you know,

1826
01:44:24.800 --> 01:44:28.430
10 years ago I would've been like, Oh really? Like, we know what is this,

1827
01:44:28.431 --> 01:44:30.860
this serious now? I mean, now it's like, Oh,

1828
01:44:30.861 --> 01:44:34.620
do you mean like an actual Nazi or do you mean like a,

1829
01:44:34.650 --> 01:44:38.930
an immediate immediate Wolf? Exactly, exactly. And you know,

1830
01:44:38.931 --> 01:44:43.490
it just begins to the stage where words just lose their meanings and I don't

1831
01:44:43.491 --> 01:44:47.210
even know. I don't take these accusations even seriously anymore.

1832
01:44:47.210 --> 01:44:50.510
And a lot of people feel the same way because so many people have been called

1833
01:44:50.511 --> 01:44:51.320
these things. I mean,

1834
01:44:51.320 --> 01:44:54.050
do you think it's going to normalize where everyone's going to calm down or

1835
01:44:54.051 --> 01:44:57.560
anything? It's going to keep ramping up? It's a good question. Um,

1836
01:44:58.240 --> 01:45:00.590
I think it depends on whether or not Donald Trump wins again.

1837
01:45:00.950 --> 01:45:02.630
I think if he wins again, it might ramp up.

1838
01:45:03.050 --> 01:45:07.610
I think he will win again because it's ramping up. Um,

1839
01:45:07.730 --> 01:45:11.660
I think that people need to chill. That's really,

1840
01:45:11.720 --> 01:45:16.400
that's really what it is. People need to chill and not get so caught up in,

1841
01:45:17.060 --> 01:45:17.960
you know, it's so weird.

1842
01:45:17.961 --> 01:45:22.820
We're living in this time where people are saying that gender is a spectrum,

1843
01:45:22.850 --> 01:45:27.050
but yet politics is binary. Okay, so your left,

1844
01:45:27.200 --> 01:45:31.250
you're on the left or you're on the right. That's good point. That's it.

1845
01:45:31.400 --> 01:45:33.740
And it's like, no. Most people, I mean, firstly,

1846
01:45:33.741 --> 01:45:35.270
most people are relatively apolitical.

1847
01:45:35.270 --> 01:45:39.410
Most people are not actually that politically charged. Like, right. You know,

1848
01:45:39.411 --> 01:45:40.610
people are busy. Most people,

1849
01:45:40.970 --> 01:45:43.420
most people just want to get on with their lives and not really be bothered

1850
01:45:43.680 --> 01:45:47.000
getting fucked over in their taxes. They want their schools to be good. Yeah.

1851
01:45:47.300 --> 01:45:50.060
Yeah. And they're not, you know, they don't want people to be discriminated. No,

1852
01:45:50.180 --> 01:45:51.470
they're not. Right. Exactly.

1853
01:45:51.471 --> 01:45:53.960
They're not ride or die for the blue team or ride to die for the red team.

1854
01:45:54.230 --> 01:45:56.480
You know? It's so weird when they are too. Yeah.

1855
01:45:56.510 --> 01:45:59.650
It is exhausting when you're around someone who's really political or like,

1856
01:45:59.980 --> 01:46:02.870
Oh yeah, I mean, I get it. If that's your, your job.

1857
01:46:02.871 --> 01:46:05.990
And that's what you do and whatnot. But ultimately, look,

1858
01:46:05.991 --> 01:46:10.220
all these people have to live in the same town, city, country, planet.

1859
01:46:10.820 --> 01:46:15.820
So we need a way for all of these people and all of this diversity on all levels

1860
01:46:16.641 --> 01:46:20.000
to work and function and people don't step on each other's toes too much and

1861
01:46:20.001 --> 01:46:20.720
everyone can do that.

1862
01:46:20.720 --> 01:46:25.130
Things have their beliefs how their views and not massively encroach on other

1863
01:46:25.131 --> 01:46:29.090
people. And I think, I think we'd actually work that out pretty well.

1864
01:46:29.091 --> 01:46:34.091
I want to say in like the late nineties to early 2010s stuff seemed certainly in

1865
01:46:35.871 --> 01:46:39.380
the West like okay, we've kinda kind of got it here.

1866
01:46:39.381 --> 01:46:43.130
And that's why I feel a little bit dismayed when I see some of these ideas

1867
01:46:43.131 --> 01:46:45.200
popping up or some of this identity politics,

1868
01:46:45.201 --> 01:46:48.050
nonsense and stuff popping up over the last five to six years.

1869
01:46:48.350 --> 01:46:52.230
And people are kind of falling back into this very tribal mentality,

1870
01:46:52.231 --> 01:46:57.231
whether it's men versus women or black versus white or red versus blue or remain

1871
01:46:57.421 --> 01:47:00.480
versus leave, whatever it is. I'm just kind of like, look,

1872
01:47:00.540 --> 01:47:04.380
I look at people as individuals and people I'm not going to be, you know,

1873
01:47:04.410 --> 01:47:07.770
I'm not running around the street trying to find how do we promote that though?

1874
01:47:07.770 --> 01:47:11.220
How do we have promotion looking at people as individuals because I think that

1875
01:47:11.221 --> 01:47:13.140
is really that, that's,

1876
01:47:13.170 --> 01:47:16.290
that's one of the keys to getting out of this mess it is,

1877
01:47:16.291 --> 01:47:21.291
is to stop tribal ideological recognition and definitions of humans just to look

1878
01:47:22.921 --> 01:47:26.940
at peoples, this is Tom, this is Sally, this is this guy,

1879
01:47:26.941 --> 01:47:30.630
this is that girl. This is this non-binary person. Whatever the fuck they are.

1880
01:47:30.631 --> 01:47:32.970
I think there's a lot to learn from children in that regard because I don't

1881
01:47:32.971 --> 01:47:36.480
think kids generally do that. Kids don't care. Give a fuck. Kids don't care.

1882
01:47:36.481 --> 01:47:38.700
I mean, where I grew up in Saudi Arabia,

1883
01:47:38.701 --> 01:47:43.260
I mean off the bat I was just surrounded by people of all different skin colors,

1884
01:47:43.261 --> 01:47:47.760
different nationalities, different religions, and it was just always cool.

1885
01:47:47.761 --> 01:47:49.050
Some of these ideas,

1886
01:47:49.320 --> 01:47:54.320
like I'd never heard people talking about race anytime more in my life than now.

1887
01:47:55.900 --> 01:47:59.880
Mm. Which is really weird to me. Right. You know, in, in the nineties,

1888
01:47:59.910 --> 01:48:03.000
in the thousands, I wasn't hearing people talking about, you know,

1889
01:48:03.001 --> 01:48:05.530
white privilege, this white or that your white man that way.

1890
01:48:05.850 --> 01:48:08.850
And suddenly it's like, you know, Oh let me tell you about my,

1891
01:48:08.880 --> 01:48:10.290
my blackness or you know,

1892
01:48:10.360 --> 01:48:12.780
you're hearing terms like blackness and whiteness and I'm just like,

1893
01:48:12.781 --> 01:48:15.390
what are you even talking about? Like this is, this is nonsense.

1894
01:48:15.391 --> 01:48:18.390
People of color, this guy, I can't stand that term by the way. Um,

1895
01:48:18.580 --> 01:48:22.680
they don't like just all this terminology and people are just talking in these

1896
01:48:22.681 --> 01:48:27.681
really bizarre ways and just kind of grouping people into these weird groups

1897
01:48:28.320 --> 01:48:29.153
that I'm just like,

1898
01:48:29.990 --> 01:48:33.170
<v 4>what's the point of all this? What's the purpose? You get some juice out of it,</v>

1899
01:48:33.260 --> 01:48:36.530
you know? That's why it's for them. It's worth the squeeze. Yeah.

1900
01:48:36.830 --> 01:48:38.210
Cause they get something, you know,

1901
01:48:38.211 --> 01:48:43.211
they get something by appealing to fellow Europeans or by appealing to,

1902
01:48:43.610 --> 01:48:46.460
you know, like the straight pride parade, you know,

1903
01:48:46.550 --> 01:48:49.880
they got a bunch of people to fucking parade. They got together.

1904
01:48:49.881 --> 01:48:54.680
Like I'm so proud of being straight. Like, Oh great, you're proud of being,

1905
01:48:54.681 --> 01:48:59.570
90% of the fucking population shaped people are under attack.

1906
01:48:59.600 --> 01:49:03.620
Like w what does that mean? That is so crazy. I don't know.

1907
01:49:03.621 --> 01:49:07.310
I pride make sense. They w S the,

1908
01:49:07.370 --> 01:49:09.920
I know a bunch of guys,

1909
01:49:10.340 --> 01:49:14.600
well I know at least three that are in the closet that want to come out.

1910
01:49:14.601 --> 01:49:18.140
But camp, they're scared. Yeah. Whether it's because of their career,

1911
01:49:18.310 --> 01:49:21.050
cause their life, you know, they're gay amongst their friends.

1912
01:49:21.190 --> 01:49:22.760
They'll let their friend, but they don't want to tell anybody.

1913
01:49:23.060 --> 01:49:25.910
So for them it's like a lot of conservatives, right? Gay.

1914
01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:30.620
Gay is the only thing that you can hide,

1915
01:49:31.100 --> 01:49:35.180
right? Like if, if you're black, it's obvious.

1916
01:49:35.450 --> 01:49:40.300
If you're white, it's obvious. If you're gay, no one knows. No one knows.

1917
01:49:40.370 --> 01:49:44.640
So you can hear people say gay jokes and say no things and,

1918
01:49:44.960 --> 01:49:47.980
and you could just swallow it and like, you know, and you could feel

1919
01:49:47.980 --> 01:49:51.490
<v 1>terrible and you could hear pastors talk about are you going to hell if you're</v>

1920
01:49:51.491 --> 01:49:55.750
gay? And you're like fuck. And they are gay and they can't come out.

1921
01:49:55.751 --> 01:50:00.280
So for them, the idea of gay pride make sense? It's a celebration.

1922
01:50:00.320 --> 01:50:03.340
It's an affirmation that it's okay to be who you are. Yeah, that's,

1923
01:50:03.341 --> 01:50:08.320
that makes sense. Straight pride is fucking preposterous. It's so ridiculous,

1924
01:50:08.321 --> 01:50:11.830
man. Every fucking, most people are straight. Bitch. What are you doing?

1925
01:50:11.930 --> 01:50:14.860
You're taking time out of your busy day and you're going to March.

1926
01:50:15.050 --> 01:50:19.360
You got to fly. What's if, if the gape pride thing is a rainbow,

1927
01:50:20.060 --> 01:50:23.720
what a, what a straight people get. I don't know. What's the flag?

1928
01:50:23.860 --> 01:50:25.780
It's kinda greedy. They took the whole rainbow though. They did.

1929
01:50:25.781 --> 01:50:28.470
They stole it from the leprechauns greeting. What is the, uh,

1930
01:50:28.690 --> 01:50:29.980
let's stop and think about that.

1931
01:50:29.981 --> 01:50:34.570
Like what does the straight pride flag w what color would it be? Um,

1932
01:50:35.140 --> 01:50:39.160
maybe all black or all white. I don't know. Black and white. I don't know. Hmm.

1933
01:50:39.490 --> 01:50:43.240
What does that black and white is? The black and white for real. There's a frog.

1934
01:50:43.270 --> 01:50:47.480
The result. I said fag. I meant to say flag. Sorry. Canceled.

1935
01:50:49.540 --> 01:50:53.100
Uh, really? There's Googled it. There's pictures of these.

1936
01:50:53.920 --> 01:50:58.300
Please put up the fucking stray. Oh, there we go. Yeah. Black Christ.

1937
01:50:58.510 --> 01:50:59.860
It's exactly what I thought it would be.

1938
01:50:59.861 --> 01:51:03.010
I was going to say it'll happen to male and females and fucking nailed it. Yeah,

1939
01:51:03.040 --> 01:51:05.650
look at that. That's incredible. Like a meme, but I don't know bro.

1940
01:51:05.651 --> 01:51:10.420
We need to get that hang one of those in the studio. Straight fried with flag.

1941
01:51:10.421 --> 01:51:13.720
Holy shit. Holy shit.

1942
01:51:13.860 --> 01:51:16.620
There's a straight pride flag is flex for everything, you know.

1943
01:51:16.621 --> 01:51:20.560
I know God damn it. That's hilarious though. Meanwhile, the gay one,

1944
01:51:20.620 --> 01:51:25.270
they have a way better flag. Make America straight again. Oh my God.

1945
01:51:26.680 --> 01:51:29.920
Oh my God. It's straight, dude. That's why there's so many of us.

1946
01:51:29.921 --> 01:51:33.430
You fucking America is mostly straight.

1947
01:51:33.431 --> 01:51:38.230
That's why this 320 million people. Oh God.

1948
01:51:38.231 --> 01:51:41.530
Yeah man. Look at people. People can do what they want, man. I have the facts.

1949
01:51:41.710 --> 01:51:46.710
I was joking thinking this is a straight pride flag and the fact that you nailed

1950
01:51:46.721 --> 01:51:50.500
it perfectly. Oh, it's probably black and white. That's another one.

1951
01:51:50.650 --> 01:51:53.320
Red and pink and blew the fuck out of here with that one. Nah.

1952
01:51:53.470 --> 01:51:55.710
Is that another one? Yeah. Oh, so there,

1953
01:51:55.990 --> 01:51:58.720
this does division amongst the straight pride folks.

1954
01:51:58.721 --> 01:52:02.820
They can't decide what's what. It's great to be straight. Look at those. Oh,

1955
01:52:02.950 --> 01:52:06.370
what do you get? What do you get people that no one wants a fuck. Look at them.

1956
01:52:06.760 --> 01:52:09.130
Look at them. That guy's got an American flag bandana. Bitch,

1957
01:52:09.131 --> 01:52:11.890
you ain't Hulk Hogan. He take that goddamn thing off right now.

1958
01:52:12.640 --> 01:52:14.890
But a bandana around his head stop.

1959
01:52:17.220 --> 01:52:19.280
Oh well what do we do? Zoghbi Oh,

1960
01:52:19.420 --> 01:52:21.880
<v 7>keep doing. Keep doing what we're doing man. I think discussion,</v>

1961
01:52:22.030 --> 01:52:26.020
to answer your question, I think discussion is what is needed to keep the,

1962
01:52:26.860 --> 01:52:30.460
keep the lid on the lid, on the pot. I think.

1963
01:52:30.910 --> 01:52:32.350
I think that's why as you know,

1964
01:52:32.351 --> 01:52:35.110
when we were talking about like de platforming and all that kind of stuff,

1965
01:52:35.111 --> 01:52:38.730
all that stuff plays into the polarization as far as I'm concerned. I agree. Um,

1966
01:52:38.800 --> 01:52:39.041
you know,

1967
01:52:39.041 --> 01:52:42.130
it drives people underground and pushes people to radical fringes and whatnot.

1968
01:52:42.131 --> 01:52:45.470
What you want is just keep the communication channels open. I mean,

1969
01:52:45.471 --> 01:52:48.770
you've only got three ways of dealing with any conflict. You can talk,

1970
01:52:49.340 --> 01:52:51.200
you can segregate or you can fight.

1971
01:52:52.110 --> 01:52:56.210
Doesn't matter if you're talking individually or countries that those are the

1972
01:52:56.211 --> 01:52:57.110
only three options.

1973
01:52:57.260 --> 01:53:01.820
So as soon as discussion breaks down or people don't want to talk or people

1974
01:53:01.821 --> 01:53:03.890
think, Oh, I can't talk to that person because they,

1975
01:53:04.430 --> 01:53:08.750
they voted Trump or if they've voted leave or they voted liberal or they voted

1976
01:53:08.751 --> 01:53:12.920
Democrat or whatever. As soon as that breaks down and I mean it's crazy.

1977
01:53:12.921 --> 01:53:17.921
You've seen all these stories about couples breaking up or families where the

1978
01:53:17.991 --> 01:53:22.130
parents won't talk to their kids anymore or vice versa, or people are kind of,

1979
01:53:22.940 --> 01:53:23.630
you know,

1980
01:53:23.630 --> 01:53:28.460
exilic and denouncing their own friends and family over politics and when I see

1981
01:53:28.461 --> 01:53:32.550
stuff like that, I'm like, that is sad. It's very, very sad. I mean if you,

1982
01:53:32.780 --> 01:53:35.900
you can have a disagreement, you can say, okay, I believe in this. I think this,

1983
01:53:35.901 --> 01:53:37.580
I'm going to vote that way. You vote that way. Cool.

1984
01:53:37.581 --> 01:53:39.530
But you can still be friends, you can still be brothers.

1985
01:53:39.531 --> 01:53:42.800
You can still be cool like that stuff. I mean,

1986
01:53:43.880 --> 01:53:45.650
if stuff is functioning correctly,

1987
01:53:46.190 --> 01:53:49.760
politics shouldn't play such a huge role in your life.

1988
01:53:49.790 --> 01:53:52.970
It should be a very much a background thing. You know what I mean?

1989
01:53:52.971 --> 01:53:57.410
It's just there, um, mean one of the main characteristics and cults yeah.

1990
01:53:57.560 --> 01:54:01.070
Is to separate you from anybody that disagrees. It is, it really is.

1991
01:54:01.110 --> 01:54:02.720
That's one of the things that they do in college.

1992
01:54:02.721 --> 01:54:05.930
They separate you from your family. It's one of the first things they do. It is,

1993
01:54:06.320 --> 01:54:08.780
and that's how people end up in echo chambers. People are like, Oh,

1994
01:54:08.781 --> 01:54:10.250
how did we not see Trump coming?

1995
01:54:10.251 --> 01:54:13.010
It's like you didn't see Trump coming because you don't talk to half the

1996
01:54:13.011 --> 01:54:13.910
population. Right.

1997
01:54:13.940 --> 01:54:17.420
And if you live in these high population areas where everyone has the same sort

1998
01:54:17.421 --> 01:54:21.110
of ideology that shares that ideology, it becomes a real problem.

1999
01:54:21.111 --> 01:54:24.260
New York and LA in particular. Yeah. It's weird. I mean, it happens.

2000
01:54:24.270 --> 01:54:28.400
The two things it, I guess it happens with most are uh, politics and religion,

2001
01:54:28.940 --> 01:54:29.331
right?

2002
01:54:29.331 --> 01:54:33.830
So if you live in a place where everybody is religious and everybody is of the

2003
01:54:33.831 --> 01:54:34.664
same faith,

2004
01:54:34.820 --> 01:54:39.820
then it's easy to sort of assume and behave in a way that everybody else in the

2005
01:54:41.631 --> 01:54:45.410
world or outside thinks and believes the exact same things.

2006
01:54:45.620 --> 01:54:49.550
Everybody you know does the same thing can happen politically.

2007
01:54:49.551 --> 01:54:50.690
If someone lives in a, you know,

2008
01:54:50.691 --> 01:54:54.170
a super liberal area or a super conservative area, you can just think,

2009
01:54:54.171 --> 01:54:56.450
okay well everyone, everyone I know thinks this.

2010
01:54:56.720 --> 01:54:59.990
So that's what everybody thinks. Yeah. And a lot of people,

2011
01:55:00.290 --> 01:55:02.810
I mean I'm a musician, you're a comedian.

2012
01:55:02.811 --> 01:55:06.140
We both go around respective countries to,

2013
01:55:06.290 --> 01:55:09.140
to different places and you talk to different people. You have this podcast,

2014
01:55:09.141 --> 01:55:12.020
you've had all kinds of people of different persuasions on here,

2015
01:55:12.021 --> 01:55:13.250
religious nonreligious, you know,

2016
01:55:13.251 --> 01:55:15.080
political all across the spectrum and whatever.

2017
01:55:15.081 --> 01:55:20.081
So I'd imagine that you can understand and empathize with all of the positions.

2018
01:55:21.561 --> 01:55:24.710
You've got your own views. But it can be like, okay, I get what I get,

2019
01:55:24.711 --> 01:55:28.130
where that person is coming from or I get how that person believes that or I are

2020
01:55:28.131 --> 01:55:32.630
get that. And just that level of empathy is really what is needed.

2021
01:55:32.630 --> 01:55:33.860
I think it's really just about empathy.

2022
01:55:33.861 --> 01:55:36.020
It's about being able to understand that most people,

2023
01:55:36.200 --> 01:55:37.670
most people want the world to be a better place.

2024
01:55:38.510 --> 01:55:40.490
There aren't that many people who wake up every thinking are,

2025
01:55:40.510 --> 01:55:41.720
I want to make the world worse.

2026
01:55:41.990 --> 01:55:44.110
I want to make my life where don't want to make my families let.

2027
01:55:44.160 --> 01:55:45.720
Most people want to make stuff better.

2028
01:55:45.721 --> 01:55:50.280
People have different ideas on what will make things better,

2029
01:55:50.520 --> 01:55:54.810
but I think as long as people sort of extend that charity to other people and

2030
01:55:54.811 --> 01:55:59.640
don't try to consider things in the worst possible way.

2031
01:55:59.700 --> 01:56:02.070
If somebody says something, whether online or offline,

2032
01:56:02.071 --> 01:56:06.570
don't try to interpret it in the worst possible way that you could or read some

2033
01:56:06.571 --> 01:56:08.430
kind of malice into it that's not there.

2034
01:56:08.760 --> 01:56:10.590
Just understand that coming from a good place,

2035
01:56:10.591 --> 01:56:14.130
you may disagree and then you can have that discussion and even if people don't

2036
01:56:14.131 --> 01:56:15.800
change their minds, you at least under

2037
01:56:15.880 --> 01:56:19.600
<v 4>stand other people better. I think you're entirely right.</v>

2038
01:56:19.700 --> 01:56:24.340
I think the idea that we can get through this world existing in echo chambers

2039
01:56:24.341 --> 01:56:28.060
and solve anything is ridiculous. Yeah. We have to communicate with each other.

2040
01:56:28.180 --> 01:56:32.260
Absolutely. You know, one of the talked to someone and they said, uh, how,

2041
01:56:32.350 --> 01:56:34.510
this is a real weird conversation I had. They were like,

2042
01:56:34.511 --> 01:56:36.730
how do you talk to so many different people,

2043
01:56:36.731 --> 01:56:39.760
people that you agree with and disagree with? I go, well,

2044
01:56:39.761 --> 01:56:43.650
I find things that I agree with even in people that I disagree with. Yeah.

2045
01:56:43.990 --> 01:56:48.640
I try to find like common ground, you know, it's like is that old sting song?

2046
01:56:48.641 --> 01:56:52.170
The Russians love their children too, you know? Okay. I don't think I

2047
01:56:54.530 --> 01:56:58.930
thought of it for whatever reason, but it's theirs. We all,

2048
01:56:59.140 --> 01:57:03.310
you can find things that you agree with,

2049
01:57:03.311 --> 01:57:05.800
with people you can find common ground. Yeah.

2050
01:57:05.980 --> 01:57:09.880
Morals and ethics and kindness and communication.

2051
01:57:09.881 --> 01:57:12.190
Compassion and comradery and friendship.

2052
01:57:12.610 --> 01:57:16.060
And we work out from there and try to figure out why does someone have these

2053
01:57:16.061 --> 01:57:17.860
politically polarizing views.

2054
01:57:18.100 --> 01:57:22.300
Why does someone have this idea about that or this and let's figure out what the

2055
01:57:22.301 --> 01:57:24.970
fuck the middle ground is. And you know,

2056
01:57:25.120 --> 01:57:28.210
and freedom is a big part of it, man. You know,

2057
01:57:28.211 --> 01:57:32.710
and the more people restricting people and the more people are trying to enforce

2058
01:57:32.711 --> 01:57:34.420
their ideology on other people,

2059
01:57:34.421 --> 01:57:37.750
the more the other side's gonna dig their heels in and then you get this,

2060
01:57:37.810 --> 01:57:39.400
this stance that we're at today.

2061
01:57:39.650 --> 01:57:42.270
<v 7>Yeah. Yeah. I mean, one of my things, I mean like I myself, you know,</v>

2062
01:57:42.271 --> 01:57:44.010
I believe in God. I'm a Christian, always have been.

2063
01:57:44.340 --> 01:57:47.820
And one thing I often say is I think, you know,

2064
01:57:47.910 --> 01:57:49.500
if you're taking something like religion,

2065
01:57:50.190 --> 01:57:54.780
I always say like if someone says I can't do such and such because it's against

2066
01:57:54.781 --> 01:57:56.970
my religion, that's totally cool.

2067
01:57:57.090 --> 01:58:00.960
If you start saying you can't do such and such because it's against my religion,

2068
01:58:00.990 --> 01:58:04.950
right? That's when that line gets crossed, right?

2069
01:58:04.951 --> 01:58:09.951
When you start trying to force things down other people's throats and trying to,

2070
01:58:10.711 --> 01:58:14.430
you know, try and change all that. So, and I think that's something that,

2071
01:58:14.431 --> 01:58:17.070
you know, not everyone is, not everybody is there yet,

2072
01:58:17.370 --> 01:58:21.510
but I think most people sort of implicitly understand that, you know? Okay,

2073
01:58:21.511 --> 01:58:23.280
cool. Like everyone, people can have all their different,

2074
01:58:23.610 --> 01:58:24.443
their different beliefs,

2075
01:58:24.510 --> 01:58:28.770
their different ideas or lack of belief or whatever the case is.

2076
01:58:29.160 --> 01:58:33.420
But as long as you're not trying to force stuff from other people, you know,

2077
01:58:33.421 --> 01:58:34.710
people don't like being forced.

2078
01:58:35.160 --> 01:58:37.910
People generally don't like being forced to do things or to,

2079
01:58:37.911 --> 01:58:41.010
to believe things were being, being punished for what they, what they think,

2080
01:58:41.080 --> 01:58:42.280
what they believe in, whatever.

2081
01:58:42.490 --> 01:58:47.290
<v 4>So when you, wherever that comes from, I think if you start having that,</v>

2082
01:58:47.291 --> 01:58:49.450
whether it's from a government or an individual or whatever,

2083
01:58:49.451 --> 01:58:53.230
that's when people are really gonna clash and collide and there seems to be,

2084
01:58:53.500 --> 01:58:55.960
there seem to be a lot of people right now who don't really get like that. It's,

2085
01:58:55.961 --> 01:58:59.440
you know, think like us think like me or we will punish you. Yeah.

2086
01:58:59.740 --> 01:59:02.380
And that's not primarily coming in the West anyway.

2087
01:59:02.381 --> 01:59:06.490
That's not generally coming from religious people. Now I'm not seeing,

2088
01:59:06.600 --> 01:59:08.590
it's more of a of a political thing. You know,

2089
01:59:08.650 --> 01:59:10.360
like we were talking about some of these,

2090
01:59:11.110 --> 01:59:14.890
some of this weird intersectional far left kind of stuff.

2091
01:59:15.070 --> 01:59:16.840
That's very much what they're doing now.

2092
01:59:16.841 --> 01:59:19.810
Even when you're talking about them ostracizing people or camp trying to cancel

2093
01:59:19.811 --> 01:59:22.720
people or whatever, it's very much like, look, this is what we think.

2094
01:59:22.840 --> 01:59:25.120
There's what we believe. Anyone who doesn't,

2095
01:59:25.150 --> 01:59:27.880
if you're not with us or you're against us and we more,

2096
01:59:27.881 --> 01:59:30.970
we're going to attack you. We're gonna verbally demonize you.

2097
01:59:30.971 --> 01:59:33.730
We're going to D platform. You were going to do all this. And I'm like, look,

2098
01:59:33.731 --> 01:59:37.510
that's, that's a problem. You can't be claiming to be tolerant.

2099
01:59:37.930 --> 01:59:42.220
And then you're treating people that way and you're talking about people that

2100
01:59:42.221 --> 01:59:45.290
way. All that's going to do is keep raising the temperature, right.

2101
01:59:45.970 --> 01:59:48.280
Temperature down. Yeah. Well said. It's a very,

2102
01:59:48.281 --> 01:59:50.950
very important what you just said, the way he said I it.

2103
01:59:51.090 --> 01:59:55.330
And there's also a tremendous amount of unhealthy people,

2104
01:59:55.660 --> 01:59:57.400
unhealthy, emotionally unhealthy,

2105
01:59:57.401 --> 02:00:01.810
physically unhealthy in terms of their perspective and their,

2106
02:00:01.820 --> 02:00:04.660
their ability to be objective about the world they live in and to be

2107
02:00:04.661 --> 02:00:09.490
introspective about their own fallen failings and shortcomings and just to treat

2108
02:00:09.491 --> 02:00:10.324
people well.

2109
02:00:10.540 --> 02:00:14.950
I think if we all went through this life with that as our directive,

2110
02:00:14.980 --> 02:00:17.980
let's treat people well. I'm going to treat people well and be nice to people.

2111
02:00:18.280 --> 02:00:22.560
Try to be friendly as much as possible and try to do my best. Yeah. You know,

2112
02:00:22.830 --> 02:00:26.860
treat. Do you know who Don Miguel Ruiz is? I don't.

2113
02:00:27.130 --> 02:00:31.600
Four agreements. I think there's like five agreements now. I don't think so. Um,

2114
02:00:31.900 --> 02:00:34.960
see if you could pull up what the four agreements are. It's uh,

2115
02:00:35.230 --> 02:00:39.520
be impeccable with your word. Always do your best.

2116
02:00:40.950 --> 02:00:44.440
Um, why can I not remember them? See it. Pull it. Pull them out please.

2117
02:00:45.510 --> 02:00:49.600
You got it. Here we go. Yeah. Um, there we go.

2118
02:00:50.050 --> 02:00:54.250
The impeccable you were. Don't take anything personally. Don't make assumptions.

2119
02:00:54.880 --> 02:00:58.240
That's three. That's three. Where's the rest of them go? Oh, that's hilarious.

2120
02:00:58.840 --> 02:01:01.150
But there's more than that. Be impeccable with your word.

2121
02:01:01.150 --> 02:01:03.280
Don't take anything personally. Don't make assumptions.

2122
02:01:03.281 --> 02:01:04.840
Always do your best though.

2123
02:01:04.900 --> 02:01:08.860
Always do your best as missing from that for whatever reason. That's hilarious.

2124
02:01:08.861 --> 02:01:11.740
So that they, there's only three, but that's Wikipedia.

2125
02:01:11.741 --> 02:01:14.360
Get the fuck out of Wikipedia. Go to that four agreements though.

2126
02:01:14.361 --> 02:01:18.550
The website right there. Bam. Okay, here. This is, it's a really good book.

2127
02:01:18.580 --> 02:01:18.970
Okay.

2128
02:01:18.970 --> 02:01:22.790
And it's very interesting because it's very simple and they added a fifth one C,

2129
02:01:23.110 --> 02:01:25.690
be impeccable with your word. Don't take anything personally.

2130
02:01:25.720 --> 02:01:27.670
Don't make assumptions. Always do your best,

2131
02:01:27.850 --> 02:01:31.840
but just those being impeccable with your word. [inaudible] very important,

2132
02:01:32.020 --> 02:01:34.600
right? Yeah. Say what you mean mean what you say and if you fuck up,

2133
02:01:35.260 --> 02:01:37.930
be honest about it. Yeah. Don't take anything personally.

2134
02:01:37.931 --> 02:01:41.690
That's very important and I've worked very hard to develop that in myself,

2135
02:01:42.230 --> 02:01:46.910
that [inaudible] people saying things about me or whether it's something that

2136
02:01:46.911 --> 02:01:48.590
goes wrong or someone fucked me over.

2137
02:01:49.880 --> 02:01:53.300
I try to take a deep breath and I try to forgive them. Yeah, I really do.

2138
02:01:53.330 --> 02:01:56.750
I work hard at it. Yeah. Don't make assumptions. That's another one.

2139
02:01:57.080 --> 02:01:58.520
Don't make assumptions. It's not,

2140
02:01:59.030 --> 02:02:02.060
does no value in that and always doing your best man.

2141
02:02:02.061 --> 02:02:04.100
You can't go wrong if you always do your best.

2142
02:02:04.550 --> 02:02:06.740
It's one of the best things anybody could say in life,

2143
02:02:07.100 --> 02:02:10.640
and I think the other one he's got a new one is be skeptical,

2144
02:02:11.120 --> 02:02:14.780
but be open to do information. I think that's what it is. Be skeptical,

2145
02:02:14.781 --> 02:02:17.600
but learn to listen. There is, yeah. These are great.

2146
02:02:17.601 --> 02:02:19.730
So he added one because he realized, yeah man,

2147
02:02:19.760 --> 02:02:23.750
I need another agreement to really good. It's a very simple book.

2148
02:02:24.130 --> 02:02:28.730
Not a super complicated book, but those tenants ways to live by,

2149
02:02:29.270 --> 02:02:32.240
I mean that is a great way for people,

2150
02:02:32.300 --> 02:02:35.120
especially people that are secular that don't believe in religion.

2151
02:02:35.270 --> 02:02:37.070
Like that is a good structure.

2152
02:02:37.370 --> 02:02:41.030
And I think that one of the things that religious people have an advantage in is

2153
02:02:41.031 --> 02:02:44.660
that they do have a moral and ethical structure to live their life by.

2154
02:02:44.930 --> 02:02:47.570
And if you live your life by that, look, when I was young,

2155
02:02:47.571 --> 02:02:49.700
I used to think there was something wrong with it. I was think, well,

2156
02:02:49.701 --> 02:02:52.100
it's all fairytales and nonsense. Why would you believe in that?

2157
02:02:52.280 --> 02:02:54.140
And then as I got older I realized, well, no, no, no.

2158
02:02:54.170 --> 02:02:58.850
If you just follow the tenants of it, I'm like, that's a great ethical,

2159
02:02:58.851 --> 02:03:01.100
moral structure to live your life by. Yeah.

2160
02:03:01.130 --> 02:03:04.340
And I think there's great benefit in people and there's a lot of people that

2161
02:03:04.341 --> 02:03:08.890
find tremendous benefit and living life with, you know, guidelines. Yeah.

2162
02:03:09.300 --> 02:03:12.320
Guidelines on how to be kindness. I mean, as a Christian, I mean, if you,

2163
02:03:12.321 --> 02:03:16.100
if you try to somewhat live your life like Jesus, it's hard to go wrong.

2164
02:03:16.160 --> 02:03:19.010
Really go wrong. Yeah. I mean even if someone doesn't believe in,

2165
02:03:19.770 --> 02:03:22.400
I would tell people, I'm like, look, regardless of what you believe,

2166
02:03:22.401 --> 02:03:27.401
you can't say that that guy is a bad example of a role model.

2167
02:03:28.221 --> 02:03:32.630
I know it says Jesus was a Dick. Yeah. Help help people.

2168
02:03:33.060 --> 02:03:37.770
You know, right now Jesus was a Dick. Right.

2169
02:03:38.200 --> 02:03:40.110
That's probably a T shirt being constructive. Right. You know,

2170
02:03:40.400 --> 02:03:42.440
someone who's been listening to your podcast for a long time.

2171
02:03:42.441 --> 02:03:46.710
Actually that's something that's a I what you just said is something that I've

2172
02:03:46.730 --> 02:03:50.540
noticed a change in actually over the years. Um, you know,

2173
02:03:50.541 --> 02:03:51.610
going back and listening to some,

2174
02:03:51.620 --> 02:03:55.460
some of the older ones where I think you were a lot more, I would have put it,

2175
02:03:56.900 --> 02:03:59.420
not aggressive, but, um,

2176
02:04:00.950 --> 02:04:05.950
a lot less tolerant of say like religion and religious viewpoints and

2177
02:04:06.780 --> 02:04:09.080
discharged. Yeah. Yeah. And I think more recent, you know,

2178
02:04:09.081 --> 02:04:11.660
more recently over the years it's been like, okay, I can,

2179
02:04:12.050 --> 02:04:16.640
I can get where that's coming from. And what the value is and whatnot. Well,

2180
02:04:16.730 --> 02:04:20.320
I have a great benefit from this podcast. Yeah.

2181
02:04:20.960 --> 02:04:22.460
I know other people benefit from it,

2182
02:04:22.461 --> 02:04:24.500
but I've experienced a great benefit and that I've,

2183
02:04:24.501 --> 02:04:29.450
I've been exposed to a lot of different points of view, different personalities,

2184
02:04:29.750 --> 02:04:33.860
different intellects and different brilliant human beings that have very

2185
02:04:33.861 --> 02:04:35.980
different ideologies. I'm, I've,

2186
02:04:36.050 --> 02:04:41.050
I've met brilliant people that I love and respect that have polar opposite ideas

2187
02:04:42.300 --> 02:04:45.210
on how the world works on both sides. I mean, it's,

2188
02:04:45.540 --> 02:04:48.010
and through that I've developed a,

2189
02:04:48.050 --> 02:04:53.050
a sort of an understanding of the various mechanisms that are at play with why

2190
02:04:55.501 --> 02:04:58.740
people believe what they believe and how they benefit from believing that and

2191
02:04:58.741 --> 02:05:00.360
what's the pros and cons.

2192
02:05:00.810 --> 02:05:05.810
And then I've just sort of opened my mind up much more to various viewpoints.

2193
02:05:06.820 --> 02:05:10.590
Yeah. Financial viewpoints, political viewpoints,

2194
02:05:10.650 --> 02:05:15.650
and I've developed a much greater appreciation for the variety of opinions and

2195
02:05:17.821 --> 02:05:21.840
ideas. Yeah. Yeah. No, that's been, it's been awesome to see like, uh, I've,

2196
02:05:21.960 --> 02:05:24.780
I've noticed it in myself and been like, ah, that's, that's cool.

2197
02:05:25.290 --> 02:05:28.110
That's kind of, I realized how dumb I am about a lot things.

2198
02:05:30.030 --> 02:05:33.060
I mean, if I had lived my life, like I'd be being honest,

2199
02:05:33.061 --> 02:05:35.250
if I had lived my life without doing this podcast,

2200
02:05:35.310 --> 02:05:38.760
I would probably be a far more ignorant person right now in the same place.

2201
02:05:38.940 --> 02:05:42.840
I feel like I've gotten not just great conversations and met great people like

2202
02:05:42.841 --> 02:05:44.310
yourself and had a great time.

2203
02:05:44.610 --> 02:05:49.610
But also I've been very privileged to have a tremendous education through all

2204
02:05:51.631 --> 02:05:55.890
these people and for many of their books and, and Brian after you right now,

2205
02:05:56.090 --> 02:05:58.680
Neil, the grass Tyson's coming on, that's all. So I'm fucking pumped.

2206
02:05:58.950 --> 02:06:01.500
You can meet him. He's in the green room. Amen. Yeah. Awesome.

2207
02:06:01.530 --> 02:06:06.530
So it's like having these incredible people to share their knowledge and a

2208
02:06:08.341 --> 02:06:10.110
lifetime of learning. You know,

2209
02:06:10.111 --> 02:06:14.340
they can fill in blanks and educate you and point you in the right direction.

2210
02:06:14.640 --> 02:06:18.480
And also you can see the way their mind works. And then there's guys like,

2211
02:06:18.481 --> 02:06:22.290
you know, like David Goggins who just, you realize like, Oh, okay,

2212
02:06:22.291 --> 02:06:26.760
there's levels to everything, man. This fucking dude, you know, he will,

2213
02:06:26.820 --> 02:06:30.060
he will make you realize that you have more in the tank.

2214
02:06:30.570 --> 02:06:33.420
He will make you realize that you can do more, you can push more.

2215
02:06:33.600 --> 02:06:36.720
He fucking sends me text messages all the time.

2216
02:06:36.960 --> 02:06:41.960
Like he sent me one yesterday and they just come out of the blue and uh,

2217
02:06:42.390 --> 02:06:47.160
like it is no rhyme or reason. There's nothing going on. No need to respond.

2218
02:06:47.400 --> 02:06:51.990
Hope all is well. Brother continued to live in the grip of life as you know,

2219
02:06:52.440 --> 02:06:56.460
nothing gets done by being a bitch. Stay hard brother,

2220
02:06:56.910 --> 02:06:59.370
as amazing. Oh wow. Wow.

2221
02:07:01.920 --> 02:07:05.250
And I get on my fucking hands, touch sweating. I'm like, I'm not a pitch.

2222
02:07:05.670 --> 02:07:09.060
I'm going to run fucking left. Well that's crazy dude. Like I said,

2223
02:07:09.061 --> 02:07:11.580
I mean it's all about potential then and I,

2224
02:07:12.240 --> 02:07:17.240
I love and I'm drawn to anybody who promotes potential and being and becoming

2225
02:07:17.940 --> 02:07:18.540
your best.

2226
02:07:18.540 --> 02:07:22.410
I think that's part of why what you do here has been so successful and so

2227
02:07:22.411 --> 02:07:27.411
inspirational to people all over the world because you promote that you promote

2228
02:07:27.900 --> 02:07:30.600
being, being your best. You can be better, you can be smarter,

2229
02:07:30.601 --> 02:07:34.190
you can learn more, you can be stronger, you can be wiser. All of that support.

2230
02:07:34.230 --> 02:07:36.400
Same thing with guys like Jordan Peterson.

2231
02:07:36.401 --> 02:07:39.670
I think so much of his success is it's like, look, you've got this potential,

2232
02:07:40.210 --> 02:07:42.640
you can, you can do this man. You know,

2233
02:07:42.641 --> 02:07:45.820
and that's the same message I've always tried to put out through my music and

2234
02:07:45.821 --> 02:07:50.110
everything that I do. I want to inspire people, I want to motivate people. So,

2235
02:07:50.450 --> 02:07:54.100
and I just think it's so necessary right now. It really is so necessary.

2236
02:07:54.101 --> 02:07:59.101
People are just floundering or spinning their wheels and just directionless and

2237
02:08:00.250 --> 02:08:04.390
it's kinda sad to see and it's just like, you know, we can all do so much more.

2238
02:08:04.600 --> 02:08:05.680
It is sad to see,

2239
02:08:05.681 --> 02:08:09.310
but there's also a light at the end of the tunnel because there's people like

2240
02:08:09.311 --> 02:08:10.420
you out there. There's,

2241
02:08:10.450 --> 02:08:14.950
there's people that are searching to improve themselves and they're honest about

2242
02:08:14.951 --> 02:08:17.830
where they are right now and they're honest about their failings and

2243
02:08:17.831 --> 02:08:20.740
shortcomings and they're also telling other people about it,

2244
02:08:20.741 --> 02:08:25.630
which I think is so important because if someone sees you and you know you're a

2245
02:08:25.631 --> 02:08:28.510
guy who's on the radio or television,

2246
02:08:28.511 --> 02:08:32.560
or maybe you're a rap star and you're killing it, you're killing it.

2247
02:08:32.590 --> 02:08:36.790
They assume all this guy is just, he just is there. He's just a winner.

2248
02:08:36.791 --> 02:08:38.440
He's just there. And then you know,

2249
02:08:38.710 --> 02:08:43.120
you could tell people about your trials and tribulations about your failings and

2250
02:08:43.121 --> 02:08:46.960
shortcomings about your thoughts and insecurities about all the things that

2251
02:08:46.961 --> 02:08:50.620
tripped you up and all the things that you learned that allowed you to advance

2252
02:08:50.830 --> 02:08:54.370
and to be a better person. That's what it's all about. Like all the time,

2253
02:08:54.400 --> 02:08:58.990
every day it's about learning how to be a better person and there's no finish

2254
02:08:58.991 --> 02:09:02.080
line doesn't mean even the fucking Dalai Lama,

2255
02:09:02.110 --> 02:09:03.160
I don't know if you've been paying attention,

2256
02:09:03.161 --> 02:09:04.570
but he got canceled recently in general.

2257
02:09:04.571 --> 02:09:06.840
The Dalai Lama guy said something slightly sex and stuff.

2258
02:09:07.990 --> 02:09:11.350
He said the next fucking 80 year old man who was picked to be the Dalai Lama,

2259
02:09:12.130 --> 02:09:15.130
female, they need to be attractive because no one, no one wants to do.

2260
02:09:15.220 --> 02:09:16.750
No one wants to look at an ugly faces.

2261
02:09:17.140 --> 02:09:21.250
No one who makes an ugly face like, dude,

2262
02:09:21.251 --> 02:09:24.390
he's an 80 year old human being. That's what he is. And he's also a guy with,

2263
02:09:24.620 --> 02:09:29.080
he has never had a real job, has never had a perform. And I mean there's,

2264
02:09:29.740 --> 02:09:34.740
there's a lot of people out there that can do better and they know they can do

2265
02:09:35.711 --> 02:09:39.100
better and they just lack the tools and they lack the understanding.

2266
02:09:39.101 --> 02:09:41.260
And I think a person like yourself,

2267
02:09:41.261 --> 02:09:44.860
or hopefully me and then certainly a lot of the people that I've had on the

2268
02:09:44.861 --> 02:09:49.120
podcast, they can give people an example and they can say, Oh,

2269
02:09:49.150 --> 02:09:52.600
this guy used to be a loser and he figured out how to not be, I can do,

2270
02:09:52.610 --> 02:09:53.530
like you look at Goggins,

2271
02:09:53.580 --> 02:09:56.890
he used to be 300 pounds of fat and eating milkshakes and then it becomes this

2272
02:09:56.891 --> 02:10:01.000
fucking maniac who runs a hundred mile races day after day. You know, you,

2273
02:10:01.170 --> 02:10:05.500
you can do something extraordinary with your life and you don't have to be the

2274
02:10:05.501 --> 02:10:07.870
guy who pushes himself physically to you, almost dead.

2275
02:10:08.080 --> 02:10:10.510
And you don't have to be the guy that writes the most books. You'd be, yeah,

2276
02:10:10.570 --> 02:10:13.090
but you could find your thing. Whatever your thing is,

2277
02:10:13.091 --> 02:10:16.840
whether it's just being a better father or a husband or a friend,

2278
02:10:16.841 --> 02:10:21.220
or a bit better at your job or better at your craft, like whatever it is, man,

2279
02:10:21.370 --> 02:10:25.510
we can all be better, can all be better, and that's how you make society better,

2280
02:10:25.770 --> 02:10:28.390
the world better. Right. That's it. To be your good man. Thank you, sir.

2281
02:10:28.740 --> 02:10:33.680
Thanks so much, man. And everybody, this is available. Yeah. Perseverance.
