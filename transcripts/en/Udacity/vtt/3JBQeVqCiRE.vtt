Given two screens of identical
resolution, like the two you see here,

00:00:04.462 --> 00:00:09.810
why would text look different
on the different screens?

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:14.070
In this case, we can see that the
resolutions are identical, and we also

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.290
know that they have the same source, so
the HTML and CSS are also identical.

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.600
Is it because CSS styles
aren't rendered predictably?

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:27.160
Is it because the device pixel ratio
differs between the two devices?

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.950
Is it because the meta tag's
initial-scale property on the content

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:35.500
attribute is causing inconsistent
zooming, on different devices?

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.220
Or is it because
the viewport was never set?

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:39.150
Check all that apply.
