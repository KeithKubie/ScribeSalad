00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.247
 

00:00:00.247 --> 00:00:00.830
I'm Sebastian.

00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:03.210
I come from Football Addicts.

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:09.010
We're a app company
from Gothenburg, Sweden.

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:11.700
We released an app
about two years ago

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.830
called Forza Football.

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.830
It's a football consumption app.

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.920
You can follow your
favorite teams and leagues

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.660
all over the world.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.032
So this is my small agenda.

00:00:26.032 --> 00:00:27.740
I'm going to go through
the challenges we

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:34.580
had with our design, which
we transitioned from.

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.740
And then I'm going to
show you some examples

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:41.590
of different views in our app
before we made a transition

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.640
to material design, and after.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.400
So here is our app.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.900
This is about a year ago.

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:50.830
It's the match list.

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.970
So you can see all the matches
that you're interested in.

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:59.710
It's a very tailored experience,
but right now is quite complex.

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.263
So a big part of this
transition to material design

00:01:03.263 --> 00:01:04.769
is the overview.

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.350
So here it's a
bit hard, I think,

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.440
to find the cherries
that you would

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:13.870
like to get out of this view.

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:17.660
It's quite hard to
like get a short glance

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:22.010
of the small
things, and that was

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:23.790
a thing we wanted to change.

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.610
The navigation is really
important in any app of course,

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.890
but we have a lot of content,
a lot of data, and information.

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.420
So getting to the
information that you seek

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.310
is really, really important.

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.050
So we wanted to get
rid of the hamburger.

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.160
We've had a side
menu for a long time,

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.800
and we felt we needed to
refresh the navigation,

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.290
and make it flatter, and
more like easy to understand.

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:55.020
Like tap on what you want,
and then get it's immediately.

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.630
And yeah, I touched on content.

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.250
It's really important that
the content you care about

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.560
pops up, on your right
when you use the app.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.730
Yeah, so here are
different screens

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:10.800
we had before we
did the redesign.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.060
In the middle here,
we see the team page.

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.460
So I think it's
quite hard to-- we

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.580
made so many iterations of
different kind of design

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:22.280
standards.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.910
So you can see a
little bit of both.

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.760
We have the IOS style toggle
button, which doesn't really

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:29.700
fit, I think.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.520
And we have different colors.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.420
We had some kind
of accent color,

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.520
but we didn't really know
what that meant back then.

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.530
And yeah, also
the league picture

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.230
with the flag and everything.

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.650
We wanted a more consistent
experience, and yeah.

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.320
So this is what we came up
with after the redesign.

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.800
We do realize that this
is a work in progress.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.050
Like you're never done
with redesigning the app.

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.450
So, yeah, we can
always improve stuff.

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.540
But if we focus
on the match list,

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:05.760
we try to make each match
feel more important.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.460
Like football consumers,
they care about results.

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.870
That should be the focus here.

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.290
We tried to reduce the size of
the-- tried to make it a more

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.410
compact navigation.

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.970
The hamburger is gone.

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.080
And yeah, we just tried
to make everything

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:27.140
more easy to understand,
and no get in your way.

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.250
And also the team pages,
and the league pages

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.480
right now are flying up,
and you can swipe them away

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.970
if you don't care anymore.

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.140
So I have some paper,
analogy going on there,

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.690
and the compressing
of the toolbar.

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.960
I could have a animation here
if I knew Google Sheets better,

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:50.910
but, yeah, you get
the point I think.

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.630
And we have pulled out
some of the key content,

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.460
the key information
about every team.

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:01.750
So we created card views of
all the things that we feel

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.620
are important.

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.280
But the major part
is, of course,

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.910
what the users
think is important.

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:11.630
So we need to test this
iterate, maybe move some card

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:13.100
views up and down.

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:15.850
But it's, as I said,
a work in progress,

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:22.070
and we try to use tests
as much as possible.

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:23.927
We're just getting
started with AVA testing

00:04:23.927 --> 00:04:24.760
and stuff like that.

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.620
It's very new to us.

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.810
But, yeah, I really
like what they're

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.850
doing at Google right now with
the design libraries and stuff.

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.600
For example this sliding thing
and the compression of toolbar,

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:40.060
I think I put two or three
months of my work and time

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.560
on that.

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.561
But now you can do it in
like five lines of code

00:04:42.561 --> 00:04:43.560
with the new design lip.

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:49.678
So thank you, Google, but,
yeah, too late for me.

00:04:49.678 --> 00:04:50.670
Yeah.

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:52.460
That was it.

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.307
