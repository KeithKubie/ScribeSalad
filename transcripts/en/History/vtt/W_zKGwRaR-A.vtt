00:00:02.168 --> 00:00:03.795
- Okay, Bill Goldberg again for
another installment

00:00:03.795 --> 00:00:05.380
of Tu's Tutorial.

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:08.591
Mr. Lam, we have seen a number
of competitors

00:00:08.591 --> 00:00:11.344
have a huge issue with Slice
Twice.

00:00:11.344 --> 00:00:14.514
Please take us through what
they do wrong,

00:00:14.514 --> 00:00:17.559
but please show us the
technique to do it properly.

00:00:17.559 --> 00:00:19.227
- I've seen guys cut it too
low.

00:00:19.227 --> 00:00:22.230
<i>You cut it too low, it's
heavy mass now.</i>

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.898
<i>It's gonna fall faster.</i>

00:00:23.898 --> 00:00:27.318
You cut it too high, you're not
gonna have enough surface space

00:00:27.318 --> 00:00:28.737
on your second cut.

00:00:28.737 --> 00:00:32.323
Your first cut needs to set up
for your second cut.

00:00:32.323 --> 00:00:34.200
- So how do you place it?

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.910
Do you do a straight horizontal
cut?

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.412
Do you do an angled cut?

00:00:37.412 --> 00:00:40.165
<i>- If I do a horizontal cut,</i>

00:00:40.165 --> 00:00:42.041
<i>I'm gonna have to create speed</i>

00:00:42.041 --> 00:00:45.545
to punch through, but now look
as the follow though,

00:00:45.545 --> 00:00:49.507
now I have to make up all this
time to decelerate...

00:00:49.507 --> 00:00:51.050
- Distance is time.
- That cut.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:52.385
That's right.

00:00:52.385 --> 00:00:54.596
So I want to position the
angles of the cut

00:00:54.596 --> 00:00:58.933
where it's kind of tracing the
fall of the sugarcane.

00:00:58.933 --> 00:01:01.728
So if I'm swinging up here, my
blade's already set

00:01:01.728 --> 00:01:02.896
on this side.

00:01:02.896 --> 00:01:05.064
All I have to do is just change
the pitch

00:01:05.064 --> 00:01:06.524
and come up at a different
angle.

00:01:06.524 --> 00:01:08.193
<i>- Understood.
- Because that sugarcane</i>

00:01:08.193 --> 00:01:11.571
<i>should be falling and letting
gravity take over.</i>

00:01:11.571 --> 00:01:13.990
- Where is the perfect
placement, number one,

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.910
and the perfect line for that
second strike?

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.870
- So let's say I go too steep
with my angle.

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.248
By the time I turn, that
sugarcane is already landing

00:01:22.248 --> 00:01:23.708
on that blade.
- Okay.

00:01:23.708 --> 00:01:25.418
- I have to create a little bit
of distance

00:01:25.418 --> 00:01:28.213
so I can create that curvature

00:01:28.213 --> 00:01:30.089
<i>to slice on that second strike.</i>

00:01:30.089 --> 00:01:31.716
- I'm gonna step back,

00:01:31.716 --> 00:01:34.260
and if you would please, sir,
show us the proper way

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.095
that Slice Twice should be
done.

00:01:36.095 --> 00:01:39.140
Because God knows we've seen
how not to do it.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.769
- Right.

00:01:42.769 --> 00:01:45.772

00:01:49.818 --> 00:01:51.277
- Hiyah!

00:01:51.277 --> 00:01:54.864
Ladies and gentlemen, that's
absolutely the most amazing

00:01:54.864 --> 00:01:58.201
Slice Twice demonstration I've
ever seen.

00:01:58.201 --> 00:02:01.329
So, sir, congratulations.

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:02.622
Thank you very much.

00:02:02.622 --> 00:02:04.415
both: [speaking in a foreign

00:02:04.415 --> 00:02:05.667
- Ah-pish.
- [chuckles]
