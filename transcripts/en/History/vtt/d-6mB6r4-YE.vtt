MIKE: Hey, I'm Mike.

00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:02.530
- Mike.
- Very nice to meet you.

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:03.430
I'm Marlene, or grandma.

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:04.130
Grandma, OK.

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:05.030
And this is Frank.

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:06.230
Hi, Frank.

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.930
- Nice to meet you.
- It's nice to meet you too.

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.330
- Pleasure.
- Yes.

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:09.330
Thanks for having us.

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:10.570
MARLENE (VOICEOVER):
My husband David

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:12.800
and I collected for 50 years.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.100
We collected all kinds of
things, unusual things.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:17.200
- We have all of this.
- You have all of this.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.200
- You have all of that, huh?
- Yeah.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.170
Hey, how are ya?
What's your name?

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.500
- Josh.
- Josh, nice to meet you.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:21.500
- This is my--
- Josh, how you doing?

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:22.570
Frank.
- Josh.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.100
- Pleasure.
- Yeah, this is my grandson.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.430
So you're one of the
guys living in the house.

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:27.000
I'm one of the four that
lives in the house right now.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.830
And we called y'all just to
try to downsize the collection.

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:31.830
We enjoy it.
But we also have too much.

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.230
So you guys are living in
the house with the collection.

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:34.130
We're trying to live in it.

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:35.170
Living around the collection.

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:36.800
Living around it,
moving it around.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.700
They're moving it from room
to room to try to get things.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.800
And said, hey grandma,
this is getting too much.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.770
Growing up as a kid, it
was always fun coming over

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.930
to grandma's house cause
there was always something

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.530
new that they'd come home with.

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.500
And we'd always get to
tinker around with it,

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.830
with grandpa's permission
and grandpa watching over us

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:52.930
all the time.

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:54.500
But now, it's just a
matter of trying to make

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.200
the house livable for us.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.730
So what year is the house?

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.830
MARLENE: 1875 or '76.
JOSH: 1875.

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:00.670
MIKE: Really?

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.000
1875.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.370
FRANK: Ha, that's early.

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.200
JOSH: My brothers and I
were packing things up

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.730
to try to make rooms livable.

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:08.200
MARLENE: I wish you
would have gotten to see

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.630
it when everything was in here.

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.230
FRANK: So it was just
packed full of stuff, huh?

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:12.570
MARLENE: Packed full.

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:13.970
FRANK (VOICEOVER): Even though
they've cleared a lot out,

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:15.830
I still can't imagine
four people Josh's

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.700
size living inside this house.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.470
I walk into the main room
and it's lamp-o-rama.

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.070
FRANK: Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.100
I am in seventh heaven.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.570
Wow.

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:29.670
I'm a lamp guy.

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.270
And I don't get to see
a lot of good lamps.

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:32.630
MIKE: Slow your roll.

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.130
[chuckle]

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.200
MIKE (VOICEOVER): After
doing this job for 25 years,

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.800
I still get a kick out of
watching the little guy

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.930
get excited about lamps.

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:42.500
FRANK: It's overwhelming here.
Yeah.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:43.770
FRANK (VOICEOVER):
Stained glass lamps

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.100
came out in the late 1800s.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.930
Some of the big makers
were Tiffany, Handel.

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:49.330
These are beautiful.

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.500
FRANK (VOICEOVER): lamps have
got at least 70, 80, 90 years

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.470
on 'em.

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:54.470
They aren't
Japanese or anything.

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:55.530
But they're--

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:56.330
FRANK: They've got
that look kind of a--

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:57.030
MARLENE: They're the Handel.

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.370
They're the Asian type.

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.330
FRANK (VOICEOVER): They got
great ornate bases too 'em.

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.000
Sure they might
need to be rewired.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.230
This one's beautiful.

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:04.900
You could set it to the
back so that-- because it's

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.130
got a panel broken out.

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.470
One's got a back panel
that's broken out.

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:09.570
Not a big deal.

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:11.870
Not a deal breaker
for me whatsoever.

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.130
What would you have
to have for this one?

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.330
Well, I-- let's see.

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.130
We probably-- most of the lamps
we paid about two to three.

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:22.530
But we bought 'em back then.
So--

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:23.670
FRANK: Sure.

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.400
FRANK (VOICEOVER): are
so hard to find anymore.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.700
But they bought them
back in the '50s and '60s

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.000
and '70s when you could
find this kind of stuff.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.130
Would you take
$600 for this one?

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:42.370
[music playing]

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:43.800
Sure, if you'd like.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.400
FRANK (VOICEOVER): Even
the repops these days

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.530
go for a lot of money.

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:47.930
But these are the real deal.

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.370
And what about this one
with the broken out panels?

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.830
What, four or five?

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.330
FRANK: $400, $1,000
for the pair?

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:55.230
- Yes.
- OK.

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.430
- OK.
- Sounds great.

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:57.430
All right.

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:58.800
And when we first
came in, I noticed

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.400
there was a couple that were
sitting on the table in there.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.370
- Oh, yes.
- Would those be for sale?

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:03.570
Yes.

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.170
FRANK: I know this is a
little bit more expensive.

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:06.570
The colors are
gorgeous when it's on.

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:07.770
Oh, it's gorgeous.

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.100
It's a Handel.

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:10.900
And this one is really
pretty though too.

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.270
This is more of
a slag lamp type.

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:13.530
But it's-- yes.
FRANK: More common.

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:14.430
Right?
MARLENE: Yes.

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:15.930
I bought some in
New York myself.

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.100
FRANK: Oh boy.
You paid up then,--

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.670
MARLENE: A couple of them.
FRANK: --didn't you?

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:18.930
MARLENE: Yeah.

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.970
What would you have to
have let's say, for this one?

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.430
Probably close to a thousand.

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:23.870
- Close to a thousand.
- Yeah.

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.370
FRANK: The one lamp is a Handel.

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:26.570
It's not a Tiffany.

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:29.500
But this is a major player
in stained glass lamps.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.100
And this one, $400 or something?

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.070
$400 or $500.

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:34.470
$400 or $500.

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.030
So you're like almost at
a thousand on this one.

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.970
Yes.

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:39.670
And let's say
$500 on that one.

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:40.600
So that's $1,500.
- Mm hmm.

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.530
You were fair I think
with the other ones on me.

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.970
$1,300?

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.100
That sounds good.

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.470
- Does that sound fine?
- Yeah.

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:52.600
It's so nice to
be able to buy--

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:53.530
To be able to have one.

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.500
- --original intact ones.
- Yes.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:56.900
FRANK: Danny wasn't kidding.

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.770
I've stepped 10 feet inside the
door and I've already scored.

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:01.900
I've got a great
feeling about today.

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.800
So what's in all the boxes?

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.170
Hard to say.

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:06.770
MARLENE (VOICEOVER): When we
got married, instead of going

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:09.430
on a vacation, we went
around to different thrift

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.030
shops, flea markets, antique
shows out in the country.

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.830
We just never wanted
to get rid of anything.

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:18.830
And that's why the
house became a museum.
