00:00:00.196 --> 00:00:02.215
- [Voiceover] Check out
this fine looking sneaker

00:00:02.215 --> 00:00:04.826
right here, we're gonna
use this shoe to illustrate

00:00:04.826 --> 00:00:07.220
some more challenging
normal force problems

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:09.829
and we're gonna take this
as an opportunity to discuss

00:00:09.829 --> 00:00:11.935
a lot of the misconceptions
that people have about

00:00:11.935 --> 00:00:13.129
the normal force.

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:15.312
So one misconception is that people forget

00:00:15.312 --> 00:00:17.332
normal force is a contact force.

00:00:17.332 --> 00:00:20.317
You only have a normal
force when two surfaces

00:00:20.317 --> 00:00:22.534
are in contact, so when
the shoe's in contact with

00:00:22.534 --> 00:00:24.844
the floor, there will be
a normal force on the shoe

00:00:24.844 --> 00:00:26.529
and a normal force on the floor.

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:28.680
Or if the shoe were in
contact with the wall,

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.575
there would be a normal force on the wall

00:00:30.575 --> 00:00:32.056
and a normal force on the shoe.

00:00:32.056 --> 00:00:34.150
But if the shoe were just
falling through the air,

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.000
here's what happens for a lot of people.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.650
Let's say the shoe's just falling,

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:39.088
and you got a question
and the question said,

00:00:39.088 --> 00:00:41.230
draw the forces that
are exerted on the shoe

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:42.757
while it's falling through the air.

00:00:42.757 --> 00:00:44.785
People get so used to having normal forces

00:00:44.785 --> 00:00:48.661
that they make a mistake, they
do this, they say alright,

00:00:48.661 --> 00:00:50.172
let me draw it over here.

00:00:50.172 --> 00:00:52.196
They say there's a gravitational
force and that's just fine.

00:00:52.196 --> 00:00:54.417
There will be a gravitational
force, there's always gravity,

00:00:54.417 --> 00:00:56.148
the Earth's always pulling down,

00:00:56.148 --> 00:00:58.337
and it pulls down with an amount mg.

00:00:58.337 --> 00:01:00.734
But they're so used to
having normal forces,

00:01:00.734 --> 00:01:03.780
I mean normal forces pop up
in so many different questions

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.769
it's almost just like a reflex,

00:01:05.769 --> 00:01:08.435
people just automatically put,
whoop, there's a normal force

00:01:08.435 --> 00:01:10.068
there's gotta be a normal force, right?

00:01:10.068 --> 00:01:11.509
There's always a normal force?

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:13.571
But there isn't always a
normal force, if the shoe

00:01:13.571 --> 00:01:16.783
is not in contact with the
surface, you don't have a normal

00:01:16.783 --> 00:01:20.160
force, it's not until this
shoe makes it to the ground

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.968
or touches another surface
that you'll have that

00:01:22.968 --> 00:01:25.117
normal force, so if we
stick this shoe right here

00:01:25.117 --> 00:01:27.429
and we let it rest on the ground,

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:29.465
now you'll have a normal
force and that normal force

00:01:29.465 --> 00:01:32.676
will point up, and this
is what people wanna say

00:01:32.676 --> 00:01:35.145
and it's true when the
surfaces are in contact

00:01:35.145 --> 00:01:36.586
but if they're not in contact,

00:01:36.586 --> 00:01:38.149
you don't have a normal force.

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:40.452
And then here's another misconception,

00:01:40.452 --> 00:01:43.295
people think the normal
force is always equal to mg,

00:01:43.295 --> 00:01:45.269
because again, it's equal to mg

00:01:45.269 --> 00:01:48.035
in so many different
scenarios that people just

00:01:48.035 --> 00:01:50.523
wanna say well it's always
equal to mg, and again,

00:01:50.523 --> 00:01:51.889
it's just like a reaction.

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:54.602
People see normal force, they
just automatically replace it

00:01:54.602 --> 00:01:57.116
with mg, and that'll be
true in the simple case,

00:01:57.116 --> 00:01:59.546
but I'll show you coming up
how that's not gonna be true

00:01:59.546 --> 00:02:01.438
and what you do if it's not true.

00:02:01.438 --> 00:02:03.791
So for instance if we wanted
to find what's the normal force

00:02:03.791 --> 00:02:06.182
if this shoe has a mass m,

00:02:06.182 --> 00:02:08.407
so let's assume that
the shoe has a mass m,

00:02:08.407 --> 00:02:10.225
what would the normal force be?

00:02:10.225 --> 00:02:11.751
We can use Newton's second law,

00:02:11.751 --> 00:02:13.854
we can always use Newton's second law,

00:02:13.854 --> 00:02:17.901
so we'll say that acceleration
equals the net force

00:02:17.901 --> 00:02:21.294
divided by the mass, and in this case,

00:02:21.294 --> 00:02:23.223
since these are vertical forces,

00:02:23.223 --> 00:02:24.867
I'm gonna consider the acceleration

00:02:24.867 --> 00:02:26.523
in the vertical direction
and the net force

00:02:26.523 --> 00:02:28.169
in the vertical direction.

00:02:28.169 --> 00:02:30.233
And so what is the acceleration
for the shoe vertically

00:02:30.233 --> 00:02:33.118
if it's just sitting here in
a room, sitting on the ground,

00:02:33.118 --> 00:02:35.717
at rest and not changing it's motion,

00:02:35.717 --> 00:02:37.807
not changing it's velocity,
the acceleration's just gonna

00:02:37.807 --> 00:02:40.038
be zero, so the vertical acceleration,

00:02:40.038 --> 00:02:42.637
acceleration, excuse me, should be zero.

00:02:42.637 --> 00:02:46.219
For the net force, I've
got an upward normal force,

00:02:46.219 --> 00:02:48.040
so I'm gonna make that positive,

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.675
if fn represents the
magnitude of the normal force,

00:02:50.675 --> 00:02:54.224
this would be positive Fn, I'm
just gonna put positive here

00:02:54.224 --> 00:02:56.031
even though I don't really
need it but to show you

00:02:56.031 --> 00:02:58.204
that it's upward, we're gonna
consider upward to be positive

00:02:58.204 --> 00:03:00.630
and then I've got this
downward gravitational force,

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.053
and if mg represents the size
of the gravitational force,

00:03:04.053 --> 00:03:06.737
I'm gonna put a negative
here to represent that that

00:03:06.737 --> 00:03:09.746
gravitational force is
down, and then I divide by

00:03:09.746 --> 00:03:13.966
the mass of the shoe and
if I do this I get that

00:03:13.966 --> 00:03:16.426
these two forces, this net
force divided by the mass

00:03:16.426 --> 00:03:19.194
has to be zero, according
to Newton's second law.

00:03:19.194 --> 00:03:22.085
But I can multiply both sides
by the mass and if I do that,

00:03:22.085 --> 00:03:24.685
the left hand side is still zero,

00:03:24.685 --> 00:03:27.609
and I'll get that this is
equal to the normal force

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:31.359
minus mg, so I'll have
normal force minus mg,

00:03:32.978 --> 00:03:35.087
and if I finally solve
for the normal force,

00:03:35.087 --> 00:03:38.806
I'll get that the normal
force is gonna equal mg,

00:03:38.806 --> 00:03:42.095
and a lot of people are like
yeah I already knew that, duh.

00:03:42.095 --> 00:03:45.067
Normal force is always equal
to mg, but it's only equal

00:03:45.067 --> 00:03:47.298
to mg in this case because
those were the only two forces,

00:03:47.298 --> 00:03:49.435
look at the assumptions we made.

00:03:49.435 --> 00:03:51.829
Only two forces were
the normal force and the

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:54.427
gravitational force and we
assumed that the acceleration

00:03:54.427 --> 00:03:57.270
was zero, if you relax
any of those requirements,

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:00.614
normal force is no longer
going to be equal to mg.

00:04:00.614 --> 00:04:02.679
And it was on a horizontal surface,

00:04:02.679 --> 00:04:05.321
if you relax that requirement,
again, there's no reason

00:04:05.321 --> 00:04:07.584
to think this has to
be in the Y direction,

00:04:07.584 --> 00:04:09.487
you could have normal
forces in the X direction.

00:04:09.487 --> 00:04:12.407
So let's slowly, one point at a time,

00:04:12.407 --> 00:04:14.687
try to relax some of these
requirements and see what

00:04:14.687 --> 00:04:16.999
that does to the normal force.

00:04:16.999 --> 00:04:19.935
In other words, what if we
just added another force?

00:04:19.935 --> 00:04:22.205
What if we let the shoe
sit here on the ground

00:04:22.205 --> 00:04:23.888
and I push down on it?

00:04:23.888 --> 00:04:26.899
So I'm pushing down on this
shoe, I'm gonna say I'm pushing

00:04:26.899 --> 00:04:31.656
down with a force, I'll
just call it F1, so a force

00:04:31.656 --> 00:04:34.586
of magnitude, F1, and
it's pointing downward,

00:04:34.586 --> 00:04:36.574
how would that change this now?

00:04:36.574 --> 00:04:38.297
So this is, we're stepping it
up, this is gonna be a little

00:04:38.297 --> 00:04:40.649
harder, what do we do?

00:04:40.649 --> 00:04:42.863
Well the acceleration is still
zero, let's say it's still

00:04:42.863 --> 00:04:45.292
just sitting there, so we
don't have to do anything

00:04:45.292 --> 00:04:47.019
with the left hand side that's still zero,

00:04:47.019 --> 00:04:49.081
multiplying by m still makes that zero,

00:04:49.081 --> 00:04:50.817
but now up here in this force up here,

00:04:50.817 --> 00:04:53.119
I'm gonna have another
force, I'm gonna have F1,

00:04:53.119 --> 00:04:55.639
that points down so in my force diagram

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:58.862
I'd have another force
that points down, F1,

00:04:58.862 --> 00:05:01.465
that means I'd have to
subtract it when I find

00:05:01.465 --> 00:05:03.574
the net vertical force, I'd have F1,

00:05:03.574 --> 00:05:06.473
this would be a negative F1 right here,

00:05:06.473 --> 00:05:09.482
and when I solve for Fn
I'd add mg to both sides

00:05:09.482 --> 00:05:12.331
to cancel it and then
I'd add F1 to both sides

00:05:12.331 --> 00:05:14.769
to cancel this F1, this negative F1,

00:05:14.769 --> 00:05:16.686
and I'd get mg plus F1.

00:05:17.653 --> 00:05:19.600
So I get the normal
force is gonna be bigger,

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.319
bigger by an amount F2
and that makes sense,

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:25.043
if you push down on a, oh no F2, wow,

00:05:25.043 --> 00:05:28.873
F1, sorry about that, it's
gonna be bigger by an amount F1,

00:05:28.873 --> 00:05:32.309
so if I push down with an
extra 10 Newtons of force,

00:05:32.309 --> 00:05:34.161
there's more pressure, right?

00:05:34.161 --> 00:05:36.306
That makes sense, the
pressure between the ground

00:05:36.306 --> 00:05:37.877
and the shoe is gonna be
greater, you're squashing

00:05:37.877 --> 00:05:40.556
these two surfaces together
with greater force,

00:05:40.556 --> 00:05:42.535
so the ground's gotta
push up to keep the shoe

00:05:42.535 --> 00:05:45.789
out of the surface, that's
what this normal force does,

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:48.058
it exerts a force to keep the
object out of the surface,

00:05:48.058 --> 00:05:51.390
to keep the object from
penetrating that surface,

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:54.975
so if I push down on an
object, into a surface,

00:05:54.975 --> 00:05:57.904
that normal force increases
and it increases by the amount

00:05:57.904 --> 00:06:00.005
you're pushing down, so that makes sense.

00:06:00.005 --> 00:06:01.984
If you had an upward
force, let's say you had an

00:06:01.984 --> 00:06:04.289
upward force, someone's
pulling up on the shoe

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:06.892
while you push down, you're
fighting over the shoe,

00:06:06.892 --> 00:06:09.331
you're wrestling over it with
somebody because they just,

00:06:09.331 --> 00:06:12.343
they love the shoe, they
recognize the beauty of the shoe,

00:06:12.343 --> 00:06:15.475
well crafted shoe, so if
there's an F2 pointing up,

00:06:15.475 --> 00:06:17.491
we now have another force in our diagram,

00:06:17.491 --> 00:06:20.303
that force would point
up, we would call this F2,

00:06:20.303 --> 00:06:22.323
over here how would this change?

00:06:22.323 --> 00:06:24.009
Again, still acceleration to zero,

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:26.078
but I'd have an upward
force now so I'd have to add

00:06:26.078 --> 00:06:29.505
F2 vertically because
that's another force,

00:06:29.505 --> 00:06:31.531
I'd have a plus F2 right here,

00:06:31.531 --> 00:06:34.007
and then over here when I solve for this,

00:06:34.007 --> 00:06:37.229
I add mg to both sides,
I add F1 to both sides,

00:06:37.229 --> 00:06:40.291
and I have to subtract F2 from both sides

00:06:40.291 --> 00:06:43.791
so now I'd have Fn is mg plus F1 minus F2,

00:06:44.719 --> 00:06:47.973
this also makes sense,
if you pull up on a shoe,

00:06:47.973 --> 00:06:50.980
you're relieving some of the
pressure between the shoe

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:53.245
and the other surface,
the shoe and the floor.

00:06:53.245 --> 00:06:56.627
So if I pull up with 20
Newtons I'm gonna reduce

00:06:56.627 --> 00:06:58.899
the normal force by 20
Newtons because I'm relieving

00:06:58.899 --> 00:07:01.781
some of that pressure between
the shoe and the floor.

00:07:01.781 --> 00:07:03.510
Let's make it even harder.

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:06.064
Let's make this thing scary,
sometimes you get really

00:07:06.064 --> 00:07:08.871
crazy problems and you don't
know what to do, let's say,

00:07:08.871 --> 00:07:12.051
we have another force, let's
say this force is gonna be

00:07:12.051 --> 00:07:15.968
a diagonal force, so
we're gonna pull this way.

00:07:17.624 --> 00:07:21.541
That was not a well drawn
force, let me draw it like this.

00:07:21.541 --> 00:07:24.016
So we got a force this way at an angle.

00:07:24.016 --> 00:07:26.516
Now we're talking, this is F3.

00:07:28.182 --> 00:07:32.677
F3, at an angle of, we'll
call it Fi, so the angle from

00:07:32.677 --> 00:07:35.344
this horizontal line here is Fi.

00:07:37.131 --> 00:07:38.830
Now what do we do?

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:41.384
So I've got this crooked
angle in here, now this F3 is

00:07:41.384 --> 00:07:44.845
gonna be pointing this way,
so I'll add another force

00:07:44.845 --> 00:07:48.183
to my force diagram, and I
can figure out how to include

00:07:48.183 --> 00:07:53.018
this into my vertical force
version of Newton's second law,

00:07:53.018 --> 00:07:56.106
I can't include the entire
F3 force, here's a mistake

00:07:56.106 --> 00:07:58.914
people make, they wanna
just add F3 or subtract F3,

00:07:58.914 --> 00:08:02.126
but I can't do that, this
is the vertical form of

00:08:02.126 --> 00:08:04.608
Newton's second law, this is
only applying to the vertical

00:08:04.608 --> 00:08:07.791
direction, the Y direction,
but F3 is pointing both

00:08:07.791 --> 00:08:09.776
vertically and horizontally.

00:08:09.776 --> 00:08:12.656
So I have to only include
the vertical part of F3

00:08:12.656 --> 00:08:15.146
in this formula so what I
have to do is say that alright

00:08:15.146 --> 00:08:17.197
F3 is gonna have a vertical component,

00:08:17.197 --> 00:08:20.620
that vertical component,
I'll call it F3 Y,

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:22.779
for F3 in the vertical direction.

00:08:22.779 --> 00:08:24.965
And it's also gonna have
a horizontal component.

00:08:24.965 --> 00:08:29.338
I'll just call that F3 X for
F3 in the horizontal direction.

00:08:29.338 --> 00:08:32.671
So if I wanna solve for F3 Y,
I'll just use the definition

00:08:32.671 --> 00:08:35.589
of sine and I know to use
sine because this side is

00:08:35.589 --> 00:08:38.144
the opposite to this angle, I know sine

00:08:38.144 --> 00:08:40.819
relates opposite side, so
I'm gonna write this as

00:08:40.819 --> 00:08:45.232
sine of phi is gonna equal
the opposite side is F3 Y

00:08:45.232 --> 00:08:48.982
so F3 in the Y direction
divided by F3 total,

00:08:50.416 --> 00:08:53.916
the total magnitude of F3,
and if I solve this for F3 Y,

00:08:53.916 --> 00:08:58.083
I get F3 in the Y direction
is gonna equal F3 times sine

00:08:59.808 --> 00:09:03.561
of Fi, now I can include this
in my force, my net force,

00:09:03.561 --> 00:09:07.572
because this points upward,
so since it points up,

00:09:07.572 --> 00:09:10.095
this vertical component's
gonna add a plus,

00:09:10.095 --> 00:09:14.341
F3 sin theta over here,
or sorry not theta,

00:09:14.341 --> 00:09:18.508
it's gonna be F3 sin Fi, and
I'll have a plus F3 sin fi

00:09:20.447 --> 00:09:24.883
right here, and when we
subtract this F3 sin phi from the

00:09:24.883 --> 00:09:27.476
other side to get it over to here,

00:09:27.476 --> 00:09:31.141
we're gonna get minus F3
sine phi and that makes sense

00:09:31.141 --> 00:09:34.860
because if we pull up, we
know we're reducing some

00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:37.510
of the pressure, we'll
reduce the normal force,

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:39.812
so this component, look at
this component points up,

00:09:39.812 --> 00:09:41.709
it's reducing some of the pressure

00:09:41.709 --> 00:09:44.266
on the bottom of the shoe,
the normal force goes down,

00:09:44.266 --> 00:09:47.523
and so we subtract the F3 sin fi.

00:09:47.523 --> 00:09:50.454
And one more way to step this
problem up to the next level

00:09:50.454 --> 00:09:53.258
would be to say that this
room isn't really just a room,

00:09:53.258 --> 00:09:54.905
maybe it's an elevator,

00:09:54.905 --> 00:09:56.926
and this elevator is accelerating upward

00:09:56.926 --> 00:10:00.132
with some acceleration
A zero, in that case,

00:10:00.132 --> 00:10:02.564
nothing would change on
this right hand side.

00:10:02.564 --> 00:10:04.914
Sometimes people think
if there's acceleration,

00:10:04.914 --> 00:10:07.807
there's gonna be some new force,
but if these are the forces

00:10:07.807 --> 00:10:10.741
those are the forces, the only
thing that changes over here

00:10:10.741 --> 00:10:13.334
if this was in an elevator
that's accelerating up,

00:10:13.334 --> 00:10:16.543
is that instead of zero,
you'd replace this with a zero

00:10:16.543 --> 00:10:19.391
or whatever the
acceleration is, that's it,

00:10:19.391 --> 00:10:21.529
that's the only change, you
could still solve for fn

00:10:21.529 --> 00:10:23.958
the same way, when you
multiply by m it wouldn't be

00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:26.767
zero on the left anymore,
you'd have a m a zero,

00:10:26.767 --> 00:10:30.394
and then a plus m a zero when you solve

00:10:30.394 --> 00:10:32.255
for the normal force.

00:10:32.255 --> 00:10:34.569
Alright, I think we've
pretty much exhausted

00:10:34.569 --> 00:10:36.875
this example of a shoe on the floor,

00:10:36.875 --> 00:10:39.222
it's probably harder than
any example you'll see

00:10:39.222 --> 00:10:41.367
but now you know how to
handle any type of force

00:10:41.367 --> 00:10:43.908
you might meet or acceleration.
