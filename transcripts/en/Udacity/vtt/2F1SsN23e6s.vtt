00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
All right. Are you with me? It's time to push forward into uncharted territory.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
We're going to go out of the first quadrant. When we look at our axis like this.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Remember we called this the first quadrant, this the second, the third and the fourth.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
So far everything has been between 0 and 90° and we found that

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
all of our trig functions have been positive.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I could take the sine of an angle, the cosine of an angle, the tangent of an angle.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
It didn't matter--all of these trig functions are positive.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Let's see what happens if we go into new quadrants.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
For example, let's look at this angle in the second quadrant. So now we're looking at this entire angle.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Now I want to know--what is the sine of that angle or the cosine of that angle,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
but first let me tell you what the angle is.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
This angle has 3π/4 radians--now, what I do in these situations is I still make my right triangle

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
relative to this x axis baseline--we can think of it as.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Now you go to Google and type these in. I know this is sort of a menial task,

00:00:55.000 --> 99:59:59.000
but there's a good reason to type these in, get an answer and tell me what you get.
