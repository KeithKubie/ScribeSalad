00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:01.370
If you have a third nipple.

00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:02.810
Please don’t show it to me.

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:05.189
Actually no I am totally curious.

00:00:05.189 --> 00:00:09.250
The scientific name for your ex’s third
nipple is a supernumerary nipple.

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:13.340
According to the NIH, supernumerary nipples
are apparently quite common.

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.370
Exact numbers vary but it’s estimated about
1% of the population have them.

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:22.080
Usually people don’t have more than one
extra nipple, but this man had seven total

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.080
nipples.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.080
SEVEN.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:29.090
Most peoples’ just look like little moles,
some are clearly nipples and some even lactate

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:30.640
during pregnancy!

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:36.360
Typically, extra nipples are found along the
milk lines, also known as mammary lines, which

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.660
run from the armpits to the inner thighs.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:44.180
In early human embryonic stages, clusters
of cells clump together along the milk lines.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.590
For most people, two of these clumps will
become breasts.

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:52.540
Usually any extra clumps regress but sometimes
they don’t and they become extra nipples,

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.180
areolas and even full breasts.

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.000
While most extra nipples exist along these
lines, about 5% are found elsewhere, and have

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.380
a different name: ectopic supernumerary nipples.

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.889
One woman had an entire breast form on her
back, along with several nipples!

00:01:06.889 --> 00:01:10.170
Another woman had a nipple and areola on the
bottom of her foot!

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.740
These supernumerary nipples and the accompanying
tissue can be located pretty much anywhere,

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.740
your arms, legs, face, even vulva or perineum.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.700
All these extra nipples are rated on a scale,
which may sound like some immature game but

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:22.700
it’s a real thing.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:23.700
I promise.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.590
It’s Kajava’s classification, look it
up.

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.850
They can range from a complete nipple with
breast tissue, breast tissue with no nip,

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.539
simple areolas that look like moles, or even
just a patch of hair.

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:37.990
In most cases, extra nurples are harmless
and go unnoticed, but some people choose to

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.990
have them removed.

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.139
Especially women at high risk of breast cancer,
as these additional nipples are susceptible

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:46.240
to many of the same diseases regular breast
tissues are.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.819
There has been considerable controversy about
whether supernumerary nipples are associated

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:55.310
with more serious conditions like renal and
urinary tract malformations, but all-in-all,

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.560
it seems like they’re pretty harmless and
just some weird, extra body part to show off

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:00.659
at parties.

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.859
Maybe you’ve got an extra nipple, maybe
it has a name, maybe your little friend should

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:05.289
have its own website.
