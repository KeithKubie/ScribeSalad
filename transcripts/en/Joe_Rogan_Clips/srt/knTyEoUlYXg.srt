1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,040
The Joe Rogan experience. Yeah.
And with less alcohol. Well,

2
00:00:05,041 --> 00:00:07,770
the other thing is that these companies,
they don't understand the culture.

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,380
It's a different culture.
You can't bullshit us.

4
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:12,960
Like you can't bullshit us
with marketing and advertising.

5
00:00:12,961 --> 00:00:14,100
That shit is not going to work.

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,030
You can't have like the most interesting
man in the world selling the weed state,

7
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,120
state thirsty my friends
now that ain't gonna work.

8
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:25,020
You gotta get somebody
like Michael Phelps. Yeah,

9
00:00:25,021 --> 00:00:27,300
man fell for real.

10
00:00:27,301 --> 00:00:30,030
I would buy weed from Michael Phelps.

11
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,500
How funny was it that he got in
trouble for that? You know what?

12
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:37,990
I find it funny is how,
how, um, you know, they,

13
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:42,660
they put these stereotypes on stoners
for so long like that we're lazy,

14
00:00:42,661 --> 00:00:44,070
unproductive and all that stuff.

15
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:48,660
This guy's one of the most
decorated Olympians in the history.

16
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:53,850
You know what I mean? What
does he got like 15 gold
fucking settles. Preposterous.

17
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:58,620
Yeah. Mister big lungs. That's what
we call him mister big lungs. Fuck.

18
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:03,390
I probably could take a rip on a
bond. Think about it and my God, Shit,

19
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,150
right. He had probably is
crazy capacity there. It is.

20
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:09,870
Probably snap a two gram boldest goal
is the person who ratted him out.

21
00:01:09,871 --> 00:01:14,420
Some Logan, some kids, some terp dickhead.

22
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:18,210
What a piece of shit. Yeah.
Imagine is going on party,
trying to have a good time.

23
00:01:18,211 --> 00:01:21,630
Some kids there with his phone.
That's social network for you though.

24
00:01:21,631 --> 00:01:23,130
They want to go viral so they'll,

25
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:26,910
they'll get you in that moment where
you know you're supposed to be a friend.

26
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,150
But that was like before all
out of that shit was happening.

27
00:01:30,151 --> 00:01:33,480
Like what year was that? Let's
guess. What gear was that?

28
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,620
12 2012 well before, yeah, before a,

29
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:42,810
let's just say before, you
know, uh, Instagram kicked off,

30
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:45,530
but there was still youtube and Twitter,
you know,

31
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,160
if you wanted to put somebody on blast
or you wanted to have a viral video,

32
00:01:50,161 --> 00:01:54,840
youtube has been there for a long time.
Yeah. Twitter was like 2007 right?

33
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:59,250
Wasn't it? I believe so, yeah. I
think when was Michael, why don't,

34
00:01:59,251 --> 00:02:02,510
was it Michael Phelps? When did he
get in trouble? I'm looking at, I,

35
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:07,320
I'm seeing different stuff. So I saw
a picture of it on youtube from 2009,

36
00:02:07,321 --> 00:02:09,770
so that means it would have
been in 2008 Olympics, but, oh,

37
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:12,600
let's see if that makes sense.
Like it was a long time ago. Yeah,

38
00:02:12,601 --> 00:02:15,880
that makes sense though, because he
didn't, he came back, right? Yeah.

39
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:19,110
He retired and then he came back.
Well, I think he was suspended.

40
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:23,580
I think it was suspended in 2009 is
when he got caught. And then, uh,

41
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:24,720
and then he had to,
you know,

42
00:02:24,721 --> 00:02:28,800
do the suspension and he came back and
got some more metals like, Haha, fuck you.

43
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:32,700
Right. I love that it was, he
suspended because of the weed. Yeah.

44
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,770
Well, you know, hey, listen on, on, uh,

45
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:40,740
in a lot of places it's still on a
banned substance list. Oh yeah. Texas.

46
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:44,430
Texas is a real bad.
February, 2008, well, 2009,

47
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,670
he was only 23 apologize incident
where he was caught on camera.

48
00:02:47,671 --> 00:02:52,220
The parties smoking a bong that
was allegedly marijuana. So,

49
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:55,470
you know,
he shouldn't have apologized for that.

50
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,080
Shouldn't have had to have
apologized for that thing,

51
00:02:58,081 --> 00:03:01,600
is that they have those guys bent over
a box because they're all just trying to

52
00:03:01,601 --> 00:03:05,620
get that sponsorship money. Right. Because
yeah, you have to be squeaky clean.

53
00:03:05,621 --> 00:03:08,620
If you want to be on the Wheaties
box, you can't be an Olympian. Yeah.

54
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:11,590
They're not going to put Cypress hill
on the Wheaties boxes. Yes. Yeah.

55
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:15,150
Wouldn't that be great
though, but take the t, h, l,

56
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:20,530
e and could it d a n,
I. E. S F plus Wheaties.
