00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
[Evans] To get our outputs in the correct range,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
we're going to use the modulus operator.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
This is written with a percent sign.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
It's usually the Shift 5 on most keyboards.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
What modulus does is takes a number and maps it to the range

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
based on the remainder when you divide that number.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
The way modulo arithmetic works is like a clock,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
so if we think of having a clock with 12 hours

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and then arithmetic on the clock is modulo 12.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:39.000
If we were to evaluate 14 % 12, what that would mean is if you start from 0

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and we make 14 steps--we're going to go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14--

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
where we end up is 2.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
That's the same as the remainder we would get by dividing 14 by 12,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and that's the result of 14 % 12 is 2.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
So now we're going to have a few quizzes

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
to make sure that you understand the modulus operator

00:01:03.000 --> 99:59:59.000
as well as the ord and chr operators we introduced.
