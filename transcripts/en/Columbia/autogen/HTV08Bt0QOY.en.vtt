00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.810
be discussing herpes simplex virus
because it's perhaps the best studied of

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820
because it's perhaps the best studied of
 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.630
because it's perhaps the best studied of
the family members and it has a very

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640
the family members and it has a very
 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.060
the family members and it has a very
unusual genomic structure and we'll

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070
unusual genomic structure and we'll
 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.160
unusual genomic structure and we'll
address that a little bit later but the

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170
address that a little bit later but the
 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.870
address that a little bit later but the
thing that is of interest most in terms

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880
thing that is of interest most in terms
 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.490
thing that is of interest most in terms
of what we're talking about is the

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500
of what we're talking about is the
 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.370
of what we're talking about is the
presence of three different origins for

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380
presence of three different origins for
 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.160
presence of three different origins for
DNA replication and they are used under

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170
DNA replication and they are used under
 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.940
DNA replication and they are used under
different circumstances we'll also talk

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950
different circumstances we'll also talk
 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.320
different circumstances we'll also talk
about the linear double-stranded

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330
about the linear double-stranded
 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.110
about the linear double-stranded
adenovirus genome and it's of interest

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120
adenovirus genome and it's of interest
 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.630
adenovirus genome and it's of interest
because it has a v prime terminal

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640
because it has a v prime terminal
 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.420
because it has a v prime terminal
protein that stuck at both ends of the

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430
protein that stuck at both ends of the
 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.680
protein that stuck at both ends of the
virus genome and in endless detail we

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690
virus genome and in endless detail we
 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.120
virus genome and in endless detail we
will discuss replication of this

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130
will discuss replication of this
 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:04.610
will discuss replication of this
circular molecule so why do viruses

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620
circular molecule so why do viruses
 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.430
circular molecule so why do viruses
undergo DNA replication I think the

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440
undergo DNA replication I think the
 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.170
undergo DNA replication I think the
answer or the immediate answer is pretty

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180
answer or the immediate answer is pretty
 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.450
answer or the immediate answer is pretty
obvious they have to replicate these

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:11.460
obvious they have to replicate these
 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:14.270
obvious they have to replicate these
genomes to make new progeny everything

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280
genomes to make new progeny everything
 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.390
genomes to make new progeny everything
is about getting the progeny out it's

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400
is about getting the progeny out it's
 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.460
is about getting the progeny out it's
certainly true and everything about life

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470
certainly true and everything about life
 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.190
certainly true and everything about life
and this almost always requires an

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200
and this almost always requires an
 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.620
and this almost always requires an
expression of at least one virus protein

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630
expression of at least one virus protein
 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:29.060
expression of at least one virus protein
that means that the virus genome must be

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070
that means that the virus genome must be
 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.580
that means that the virus genome must be
transcribed at some point in some

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590
transcribed at some point in some
 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.520
transcribed at some point in some
instances many virus proteins are

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530

quiescent is not actively synthesizing
DNA and if you activate the cell

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:37.810

initiate the replication process and
 

00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:53.100
initiate the replication process and
indeed these a very limited number of

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:53.110
indeed these a very limited number of
 

00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:55.280
indeed these a very limited number of

excuse me genome can do this and then
 

00:11:58.810 --> 00:12:01.620
excuse me genome can do this and then
again we get to the point that the virus

00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:01.630
again we get to the point that the virus
 

00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:04.350
again we get to the point that the virus
must elaborate immediate early and early

00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:04.360

00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:11.340
gene products before it can begin
initiation of DNA synthesis so what's

00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:11.350
initiation of DNA synthesis so what's
 

00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:14.160

the host for the host is a bag it's a
 

00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:17.630
the host for the host is a bag it's a
bag of enzymes it's a bag of structural

00:12:17.630 --> 00:12:17.640
bag of enzymes it's a bag of structural
 

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:21.150
bag of enzymes it's a bag of structural
elements and these enzymes the

00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:21.160
elements and these enzymes the
 

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:23.460
elements and these enzymes the
structural sites mostly present in the

00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:23.470
structural sites mostly present in the
 

00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:25.560
structural sites mostly present in the
nucleus provide a place for the virus to

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:25.570
nucleus provide a place for the virus to
 

00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:28.200

lodge simple viruses conserve genetic

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:28.210
lodge simple viruses conserve genetic
 

00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:31.950
lodge simple viruses conserve genetic
information so they usually elaborate a

00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:31.960
information so they usually elaborate a
 

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:35.700
information so they usually elaborate a
protein or two at most and they use the

00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:35.710
protein or two at most and they use the
 

00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:36.769
protein or two at most and they use the
host

00:12:36.769 --> 00:12:36.779
host
 

00:12:36.779 --> 00:12:41.119
host
in that case the virus can replicate

00:12:41.119 --> 00:12:41.129
in that case the virus can replicate
 

00:12:41.129 --> 00:12:42.920
in that case the virus can replicate
along with the host the host will have

00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:42.930
along with the host the host will have
 

00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:44.860
along with the host the host will have
some limited DNA replication and the

00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:44.870
some limited DNA replication and the
 

00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:47.829
some limited DNA replication and the
virus will also have DNA replication

00:12:47.829 --> 00:12:47.839
virus will also have DNA replication
 

00:12:47.839 --> 00:12:51.220
virus will also have DNA replication
with the more complex viruses however

00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:51.230
with the more complex viruses however
 

00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:53.809
with the more complex viruses however
they encode many but not all the

00:12:53.809 --> 00:12:53.819
they encode many but not all the
 

00:12:53.819 --> 00:12:54.949
they encode many but not all the
proteins that are required for

00:12:54.949 --> 00:12:54.959
proteins that are required for
 

00:12:54.959 --> 00:13:00.559
proteins that are required for
replication so we can put virus proteins

00:13:00.559 --> 00:13:00.569
replication so we can put virus proteins
 

00:13:00.569 --> 00:13:04.129
replication so we can put virus proteins
into a test tube along with either a

00:13:04.129 --> 00:13:04.139
into a test tube along with either a
 

00:13:04.139 --> 00:13:05.780
into a test tube along with either a

genome and get some replication it's
 

00:13:13.019 --> 00:13:15.050

very difficult to get initiation it's

00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:15.060
very difficult to get initiation it's
 

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:17.119
very difficult to get initiation it's
not precise and the reason for that is

00:13:17.119 --> 00:13:17.129
not precise and the reason for that is
 

00:13:17.129 --> 00:13:18.829
not precise and the reason for that is
that we don't know all of the components

00:13:18.829 --> 00:13:18.839
that we don't know all of the components
 

00:13:18.839 --> 00:13:20.869
that we don't know all of the components

how is DNA synthesis primed what's the
 

00:28:47.719 --> 00:28:50.949
how is DNA synthesis primed what's the
origin for DNA replication and that's an

00:28:50.949 --> 00:28:50.959
origin for DNA replication and that's an
 

00:28:50.959 --> 00:28:53.439
origin for DNA replication and that's an
unknown and this is of some interest

00:28:53.439 --> 00:28:53.449
unknown and this is of some interest
 

00:28:53.449 --> 00:28:55.779

because it turns up in all sorts of
 

00:28:55.789 --> 00:28:57.430
because it turns up in all sorts of
different products so for example there

00:28:57.430 --> 00:28:57.440
different products so for example there
 

00:28:57.440 --> 00:29:01.329

where did it come from probably from

00:29:25.989 --> 00:29:25.999
where did it come from probably from
 

00:29:25.999 --> 00:29:28.299
where did it come from probably from
from some serum component that was used

00:29:28.299 --> 00:29:28.309
from some serum component that was used
 

00:29:28.309 --> 00:29:30.339
from some serum component that was used
to grow the cells but without knowing

to grow the cells but without knowing
 

00:29:30.349 --> 00:29:32.979
to grow the cells but without knowing
what it is there's a reasonable doubt

00:29:32.979 --> 00:29:32.989
what it is there's a reasonable doubt
 

00:29:32.989 --> 00:29:36.729
what it is there's a reasonable doubt
and so you get rid of it and we have a

00:29:36.729 --> 00:29:36.739
and so you get rid of it and we have a
 

00:29:36.739 --> 00:29:39.069
and so you get rid of it and we have a
parvo vera die which started

00:29:39.069 --> 00:29:39.079

parvo vera die which started
single-stranded molecules get replicated

00:29:41.019 --> 00:29:41.029
single-stranded molecules get replicated
 

00:29:41.029 --> 00:29:43.299
single-stranded molecules get replicated
to make a double-stranded DNA molecule

00:29:43.299 --> 00:29:43.309
to make a double-stranded DNA molecule
 

00:29:43.309 --> 00:29:45.819
to make a double-stranded DNA molecule
and keep doing this back and forth and

00:29:45.819 --> 00:29:45.829
and keep doing this back and forth and
 

00:29:45.829 --> 00:29:47.259
and keep doing this back and forth and
we'll we'll show you what that's all

00:29:47.259 --> 00:29:47.269
we'll we'll show you what that's all
 

00:29:47.269 --> 00:29:52.029
we'll we'll show you what that's all
about in a bit the last one and we're

00:29:52.029 --> 00:29:52.039
about in a bit the last one and we're
 

00:29:52.039 --> 00:29:53.439
about in a bit the last one and we're
not going to talk much about it but this

00:29:53.439 --> 00:29:53.449
not going to talk much about it but this
 

00:29:53.449 --> 00:29:57.729
not going to talk much about it but this
is hepatitis B which is thankfully

00:29:57.729 --> 00:29:57.739
is hepatitis B which is thankfully
 

00:29:57.739 --> 00:29:59.669
is hepatitis B which is thankfully
pretty much under control because of

00:29:59.669 --> 00:29:59.679
pretty much under control because of
 

00:29:59.679 --> 00:30:02.769
pretty much under control because of
good vaccination protocols but this is a

00:30:02.769 --> 00:30:02.779
good vaccination protocols but this is a
 

00:30:02.779 --> 00:30:04.449
good vaccination protocols but this is a
very interesting molecule because you'll

00:30:04.449 --> 00:30:04.459
very interesting molecule because you'll
 

00:30:04.459 --> 00:30:06.789
very interesting molecule because you'll
note that it's sort of double stranded

00:30:06.789 --> 00:30:06.799
note that it's sort of double stranded
 

00:30:06.799 --> 00:30:13.869
note that it's sort of double stranded
and one strand is complete and one

00:30:13.869 --> 00:30:13.879
and one strand is complete and one
 

00:30:13.879 --> 00:30:15.970
and one strand is complete and one
strand is incomplete

00:30:15.970 --> 00:30:15.980
strand is incomplete
 

00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:18.250
strand is incomplete
and the incomplete strand actually

00:30:18.250 --> 00:30:18.260
and the incomplete strand actually
 

00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:22.299
and the incomplete strand actually
overlaps the other strand so what you

00:30:22.299 --> 00:30:22.309
overlaps the other strand so what you
 

00:30:22.309 --> 00:30:25.419
overlaps the other strand so what you
have is a five point men that has to be

00:30:25.419 --> 00:30:25.429
have is a five point men that has to be
 

00:30:25.429 --> 00:30:27.370
have is a five point men that has to be
cut because this guy's going to

00:30:27.370 --> 00:30:27.380
cut because this guy's going to
 

00:30:27.380 --> 00:30:29.350
cut because this guy's going to
replicate further so the first thing

00:30:29.350 --> 00:30:29.360
replicate further so the first thing
 

00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:31.390
replicate further so the first thing
this virus does where this virus DNA

00:30:31.390 --> 00:30:31.400
this virus does where this virus DNA
 

00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:33.640
this virus does where this virus DNA
does when it gets into itself but if you

00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:33.650
does when it gets into itself but if you
 

00:30:33.650 --> 00:30:36.730
does when it gets into itself but if you
used the host to repair this molecule

00:30:36.730 --> 00:30:36.740
used the host to repair this molecule
 

00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:39.090
used the host to repair this molecule
and then it becomes a super coiled

00:30:39.090 --> 00:30:39.100
and then it becomes a super coiled
 

00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:44.640
and then it becomes a super coiled
circular covalently closed DNA molecule

00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:44.650
circular covalently closed DNA molecule
 

00:30:44.650 --> 00:30:47.500
circular covalently closed DNA molecule
then it can be transcribed and begin its

00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:47.510
then it can be transcribed and begin its
 

00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:49.720
then it can be transcribed and begin its
process but the most interesting fact is

00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:49.730
process but the most interesting fact is
 

00:30:49.730 --> 00:30:51.730
process but the most interesting fact is
that after it does all that it's really

00:30:51.730 --> 00:30:51.740
that after it does all that it's really
 

00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:54.340
that after it does all that it's really
a retrovirus so you'll learn more about

00:30:54.340 --> 00:30:54.350
a retrovirus so you'll learn more about
 

00:30:54.350 --> 00:30:56.409
a retrovirus so you'll learn more about
that as we go through the retrovirus

00:30:56.409 --> 00:30:56.419
that as we go through the retrovirus
 

00:30:56.419 --> 00:31:00.010
that as we go through the retrovirus
lifecycle so there are two basic modes

00:31:00.010 --> 00:31:00.020
lifecycle so there are two basic modes
 

00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:04.060
lifecycle so there are two basic modes
of replication there is replication fork

00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:04.070
of replication there is replication fork
 

00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:07.150
of replication there is replication fork
based synthesis where there is a leading

00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:11.080
based synthesis where there is a leading
strand where DNA replication elongation

00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:11.090
strand where DNA replication elongation
 

00:31:11.090 --> 00:31:14.140
strand where DNA replication elongation
is continuous starts at a specific with

creates discontinuities because it's

00:33:18.799 --> 00:33:18.809
creates discontinuities because it's
 

00:33:18.809 --> 00:33:20.539
creates discontinuities because it's
replicating in the same direction and

said it's a DNA binding protein perhaps
 

00:33:52.979 --> 00:33:55.129
said it's a DNA binding protein perhaps
the most fascinating feature is that

00:33:55.129 --> 00:33:55.139
the most fascinating feature is that
 

00:33:55.139 --> 00:33:57.680
the most fascinating feature is that
it's species-specific so a polyomavirus

00:33:57.680 --> 00:33:57.690
it's species-specific so a polyomavirus
 

00:33:57.690 --> 00:34:00.799
it's species-specific so a polyomavirus
that's originates from a mouse cannot

00:34:00.799 --> 00:34:00.809
that's originates from a mouse cannot

replicate in human cells and vice versa
 

00:34:03.330 --> 00:34:05.599
replicate in human cells and vice versa
and the reason for that is that pre

00:34:05.599 --> 00:34:05.609
and the reason for that is that pre
 

00:34:05.609 --> 00:34:08.750

initiation complex is do not form in the

00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:08.760
initiation complex is do not form in the
 

00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:11.119
initiation complex is do not form in the
wrong species so if you have a human

00:34:11.119 --> 00:34:11.129
wrong species so if you have a human
 

00:34:11.129 --> 00:34:13.339
wrong species so if you have a human
virus you put it into a mouse cell it

00:34:13.339 --> 00:34:13.349
virus you put it into a mouse cell it
 

00:34:13.349 --> 00:34:16.190
virus you put it into a mouse cell it
gets into the cell it finds nucleus and

00:34:16.190 --> 00:34:16.200
gets into the cell it finds nucleus and
 

00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:18.799
gets into the cell it finds nucleus and
it does squat it just can't do anything

00:34:18.799 --> 00:34:18.809
it does squat it just can't do anything
 

00:34:18.809 --> 00:34:20.389
it does squat it just can't do anything
because it can't initiate DNA

00:34:20.389 --> 00:34:20.399
because it can't initiate DNA
 

00:34:20.399 --> 00:34:22.549
because it can't initiate DNA
replication and the reason for that is

00:34:22.549 --> 00:34:22.559
replication and the reason for that is
 

00:34:22.559 --> 00:34:25.879
replication and the reason for that is
it doesn't interact with the host DNA

00:34:25.879 --> 00:34:25.889
it doesn't interact with the host DNA
 

00:34:25.889 --> 00:34:29.629
it doesn't interact with the host DNA
polymerase alpha prime is protein

00:34:29.629 --> 00:34:29.639
polymerase alpha prime is protein
 

00:34:29.639 --> 00:34:33.919
polymerase alpha prime is protein
complex so it can't initiate

this protein binds and sequester's
 

00:34:36.059 --> 00:34:39.710
this protein binds and sequester's
cell-cycle regulators why because it

00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:39.720
cell-cycle regulators why because it
 

00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:41.839
cell-cycle regulators why because it
causes cells to enter the S phase so why

00:34:41.839 --> 00:34:41.849
causes cells to enter the S phase so why
 

00:34:41.849 --> 00:34:43.869
causes cells to enter the S phase so why
is that important for these viruses

00:34:43.869 --> 00:34:43.879
is that important for these viruses
 

00:34:43.879 --> 00:34:47.510
is that important for these viruses
because once they enter s they

00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:47.520
because once they enter s they
 

00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:50.119
because once they enter s they
synthesize DNA or they gear up the

machinery that's used to synthesize DNA
so it becomes available its synthesis is

00:34:57.440 --> 00:34:57.450
so it becomes available its synthesis is
 

00:34:57.450 --> 00:34:59.930
so it becomes available its synthesis is
auto regulated that means it turns off

00:34:59.930 --> 00:34:59.940
auto regulated that means it turns off
 

00:34:59.940 --> 00:35:03.829
auto regulated that means it turns off
its own synthesis it makes a large

00:35:03.829 --> 00:35:03.839
its own synthesis it makes a large
 

00:35:03.839 --> 00:35:07.220
its own synthesis it makes a large
amount then it shuts itself down the

amount then it shuts itself down the
 

00:35:07.230 --> 00:35:10.400
amount then it shuts itself down the
protein is heavily modified that means

00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:10.410
protein is heavily modified that means
 

00:35:10.410 --> 00:35:12.680
protein is heavily modified that means
it's decorated with other moieties such

00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:12.690
it's decorated with other moieties such
 

00:35:12.690 --> 00:35:15.559

00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:07.310
that topo everything's wound up so
that'll Nick and allow things to unwind

00:40:07.310 --> 00:40:07.320
that'll Nick and allow things to unwind
 

00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:13.050
that'll Nick and allow things to unwind
now allows for the extrusion of the DNA

00:40:13.050 --> 00:40:13.060
now allows for the extrusion of the DNA
 

00:40:13.060 --> 00:40:16.800
now allows for the extrusion of the DNA
and makes it available as a template for

00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:16.810
and makes it available as a template for
 

00:40:16.810 --> 00:40:19.020
and makes it available as a template for
DNA replication so you now have the

00:40:19.020 --> 00:40:19.030
DNA replication so you now have the
 

00:40:19.030 --> 00:40:21.680
DNA replication so you now have the
origin exposed and it's available now

00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:21.690
origin exposed and it's available now
 

00:40:21.690 --> 00:40:25.950
origin exposed and it's available now
how do we know there's a single site for

00:40:25.950 --> 00:40:25.960
how do we know there's a single site for
 

00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:27.900
how do we know there's a single site for
DNA initiation this is a great

00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:27.910
DNA initiation this is a great
 

00:40:27.910 --> 00:40:29.850
DNA initiation this is a great
experiment this is one of those you know

00:40:29.850 --> 00:40:29.860
experiment this is one of those you know
 

00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:40.230
experiment this is one of those you know
pictures a thousand-word guys and

00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:40.240
 

00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:46.180
okay and it's nice to think about if you

00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:46.190
okay and it's nice to think about if you
 

00:40:46.190 --> 00:40:48.250
okay and it's nice to think about if you
assume that a circular molecule has a

00:40:48.250 --> 00:40:48.260
assume that a circular molecule has a
 

00:40:48.260 --> 00:40:51.490
assume that a circular molecule has a
single site of initiation and that

00:40:51.490 --> 00:40:51.500
single site of initiation and that
 

00:40:51.500 --> 00:40:54.580
single site of initiation and that
there's also in a symmetrically position

00:40:54.580 --> 00:40:54.590
there's also in a symmetrically position
 

00:40:54.590 --> 00:40:57.280
there's also in a symmetrically position
restriction endonuclease site then when

00:40:57.280 --> 00:40:57.290
restriction endonuclease site then when
 

00:40:57.290 --> 00:41:00.130
restriction endonuclease site then when
you open up the molecule the origin of

00:41:00.130 --> 00:41:00.140
you open up the molecule the origin of
 

00:41:00.140 --> 00:41:02.680
you open up the molecule the origin of
DNA replication will be a symmetrically

00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:02.690
DNA replication will be a symmetrically
 

00:41:02.690 --> 00:41:06.970
DNA replication will be a symmetrically
positioned from the ends and that's

00:41:06.970 --> 00:41:06.980
positioned from the ends and that's
 

00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:08.560
positioned from the ends and that's
shown down here look at that little

00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:08.570
shown down here look at that little
 

00:41:08.570 --> 00:41:10.930
shown down here look at that little
bubble as the origin and you can see

00:41:10.930 --> 00:41:10.940
bubble as the origin and you can see
 

00:41:10.940 --> 00:41:15.610
bubble as the origin and you can see
that its distance from the origin to the

00:41:15.610 --> 00:41:15.620
that its distance from the origin to the
 

00:41:15.620 --> 00:41:17.650
that its distance from the origin to the
left end versus the right end is quite

00:41:17.650 --> 00:41:17.660
left end versus the right end is quite
 

00:41:17.660 --> 00:41:19.840
left end versus the right end is quite
distinct again here it's better shown

00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:19.850
distinct again here it's better shown
 

00:41:19.850 --> 00:41:21.760
distinct again here it's better shown
here that's the origin that little

00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:21.770
here that's the origin that little
 

00:41:21.770 --> 00:41:24.190
here that's the origin that little
bubble and this is one arm that would be

00:41:24.190 --> 00:41:24.200
bubble and this is one arm that would be
 

00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:26.860
bubble and this is one arm that would be
this long one and this is the other arm

00:41:26.860 --> 00:41:26.870
this long one and this is the other arm
 

00:41:26.870 --> 00:41:30.570
this long one and this is the other arm
and that would be the short one okay now

00:41:30.570 --> 00:41:30.580
and that would be the short one okay now
 

00:41:30.580 --> 00:41:36.910
and that would be the short one okay now
as DNA synthesis occurs and as DNA along

00:41:36.910 --> 00:41:36.920
as DNA synthesis occurs and as DNA along
 

00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:41.140
as DNA synthesis occurs and as DNA along
gates this bubble gets bigger gets

00:41:41.140 --> 00:41:41.150
gates this bubble gets bigger gets
 

00:41:41.150 --> 00:41:43.320
gates this bubble gets bigger gets
bigger this DNA is replicating and

00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:43.330
bigger this DNA is replicating and
 

00:41:43.330 --> 00:41:47.500
bigger this DNA is replicating and
eventually it begins to expand until it

00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:47.510
eventually it begins to expand until it
 

00:41:47.510 --> 00:41:50.740
eventually it begins to expand until it
occupies the entire sequence up to the

00:41:50.740 --> 00:41:50.750
occupies the entire sequence up to the
 

00:41:50.750 --> 00:41:53.350
occupies the entire sequence up to the
restriction site once you pass the

00:41:53.350 --> 00:41:53.360
restriction site once you pass the
 

00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:55.660
restriction site once you pass the
restriction site it gets cut and you

00:41:55.660 --> 00:41:55.670
restriction site it gets cut and you
 

00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:56.950
restriction site it gets cut and you
have two of them molecules that are

00:41:56.950 --> 00:41:56.960
have two of them molecules that are
 

00:41:56.960 --> 00:41:59.260
have two of them molecules that are
dangling off so now how do you know that

00:41:59.260 --> 00:41:59.270
dangling off so now how do you know that
 

00:41:59.270 --> 00:42:04.470
dangling off so now how do you know that
replication is bi-directional anyone

00:42:04.470 --> 00:42:04.480
replication is bi-directional anyone
 

00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:09.310
replication is bi-directional anyone
don't all shout out what tells you that

00:42:09.310 --> 00:42:09.320
don't all shout out what tells you that
 

00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:14.989
don't all shout out what tells you that
it's bi-directional yes

00:42:14.989 --> 00:42:14.999
 

00:42:14.999 --> 00:42:17.870
all right the ends are getting shorter

00:42:17.870 --> 00:42:17.880
all right the ends are getting shorter
 

00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:22.880
all right the ends are getting shorter
it's growing in both directions at once

00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:22.890
it's growing in both directions at once
 

00:42:22.890 --> 00:42:29.519
it's growing in both directions at once
yes well watch the distance from the

00:42:29.519 --> 00:42:29.529
yes well watch the distance from the
 

00:42:29.529 --> 00:42:33.539
yes well watch the distance from the
bubble to this end gets shorter as a

00:42:33.539 --> 00:42:33.549
bubble to this end gets shorter as a
 

00:42:33.549 --> 00:42:35.099
bubble to this end gets shorter as a
replication proceeds until you get to

00:42:35.099 --> 00:42:35.109
replication proceeds until you get to
 

00:42:35.109 --> 00:42:36.779
replication proceeds until you get to
the point where it's really close and

00:42:36.779 --> 00:42:36.789
the point where it's really close and
 

00:42:36.789 --> 00:42:39.509
the point where it's really close and
once you get to that edge so what you

00:42:39.509 --> 00:42:39.519
once you get to that edge so what you
 

00:42:39.519 --> 00:42:41.999
once you get to that edge so what you
have to remember is that this is a

00:42:41.999 --> 00:42:42.009
have to remember is that this is a
 

00:42:42.009 --> 00:42:43.680
have to remember is that this is a
molecule caught in the act of

00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:43.690
molecule caught in the act of
 

00:42:43.690 --> 00:42:45.900
molecule caught in the act of
replicating it's not like a bandit right

00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:45.910
replicating it's not like a bandit right
 

00:42:45.910 --> 00:42:48.509
replicating it's not like a bandit right
and then you cleave it now if that

00:42:48.509 --> 00:42:48.519
and then you cleave it now if that
 

00:42:48.519 --> 00:42:51.539
and then you cleave it now if that
cleave if that site the restriction

00:42:51.539 --> 00:42:51.549
cleave if that site the restriction
 

00:42:51.549 --> 00:42:54.390
cleave if that site the restriction
enzyme site whereas replicated so where

00:42:54.390 --> 00:42:54.400
enzyme site whereas replicated so where
 

00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:57.329
enzyme site whereas replicated so where
the green dot is now here those ends

00:42:57.329 --> 00:42:57.339
the green dot is now here those ends
 

00:42:57.339 --> 00:43:00.390
the green dot is now here those ends
would now be open because they'd have

00:43:00.390 --> 00:43:00.400
would now be open because they'd have
 

00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:03.509
would now be open because they'd have
been duplicated okay

00:43:03.509 --> 00:43:03.519
been duplicated okay
 

00:43:03.519 --> 00:43:07.529
been duplicated okay
so back to replication all right we now

00:43:07.529 --> 00:43:07.539
so back to replication all right we now
 

00:43:07.539 --> 00:43:09.900
so back to replication all right we now
know that it's bi-directional we know

00:43:09.900 --> 00:43:09.910
know that it's bi-directional we know
 

00:43:09.910 --> 00:43:11.999
know that it's bi-directional we know
that it starts at a unique origin and

00:43:11.999 --> 00:43:12.009
that it starts at a unique origin and
 

00:43:12.009 --> 00:43:14.400
that it starts at a unique origin and
now we have the problem of leading and

00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:14.410
now we have the problem of leading and
 

00:43:14.410 --> 00:43:17.190
now we have the problem of leading and
lagging strands that is remember DNA

00:43:17.190 --> 00:43:17.200
lagging strands that is remember DNA
 

00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:20.160
lagging strands that is remember DNA
only occurs DNA synthesis only occurs in

00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:20.170
only occurs DNA synthesis only occurs in
 

00:43:20.170 --> 00:43:23.640
only occurs DNA synthesis only occurs in
one direction 5 prime to 3 prime so if

00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:23.650
one direction 5 prime to 3 prime so if
 

00:43:23.650 --> 00:43:25.440
one direction 5 prime to 3 prime so if
you start with your leading strand and

00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:25.450
you start with your leading strand and
 

00:43:25.450 --> 00:43:28.529
you start with your leading strand and
you replicate here continuously how do

00:43:28.529 --> 00:43:28.539
you replicate here continuously how do
 

00:43:28.539 --> 00:43:30.900
you replicate here continuously how do
you replicate this part of the

00:43:30.900 --> 00:43:30.910
you replicate this part of the
 

00:43:30.910 --> 00:43:33.509
you replicate this part of the
replication fork and that's the issue

00:43:33.509 --> 00:43:33.519
replication fork and that's the issue
 

00:43:33.519 --> 00:43:37.279
replication fork and that's the issue
well you do it using Okazaki fragments

00:43:37.279 --> 00:43:37.289
well you do it using Okazaki fragments
 

00:43:37.289 --> 00:43:39.660
well you do it using Okazaki fragments
Okazaki fragments as I said before are

00:43:39.660 --> 00:43:39.670
Okazaki fragments as I said before are
 

00:43:39.670 --> 00:43:43.950
Okazaki fragments as I said before are
RNA prime DNA poly nucleotides so what

00:43:43.950 --> 00:43:43.960
RNA prime DNA poly nucleotides so what
 

00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:47.249
RNA prime DNA poly nucleotides so what
happens is once this leading strand

00:43:47.249 --> 00:43:47.259
happens is once this leading strand
 

00:43:47.259 --> 00:43:49.349
happens is once this leading strand
begins synthesized it begins to be

00:43:49.349 --> 00:43:49.359
begins synthesized it begins to be
 

00:43:49.359 --> 00:43:51.809
begins synthesized it begins to be
synthesized then the polymer ASIS and

00:43:51.809 --> 00:43:51.819
synthesized then the polymer ASIS and
 

00:43:51.819 --> 00:43:53.969
synthesized then the polymer ASIS and
we'll go into this in negging detail in

00:43:53.969 --> 00:43:53.979
we'll go into this in negging detail in
 

00:43:53.979 --> 00:43:56.849
we'll go into this in negging detail in
a second now have available to them

00:43:56.849 --> 00:43:56.859
a second now have available to them
 

00:43:56.859 --> 00:44:01.170
a second now have available to them
parts of this replication fork using

00:44:01.170 --> 00:44:01.180
parts of this replication fork using
 

00:44:01.180 --> 00:44:04.709
parts of this replication fork using
polymerase alpha as a Primus and T

by the way you now lay down a small

00:44:09.089 --> 00:44:09.099
by the way you now lay down a small
 

00:44:09.099 --> 00:44:11.430
by the way you now lay down a small
track of ribonucleotides which have

00:44:11.430 --> 00:44:11.440
track of ribonucleotides which have
 

00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:15.569
track of ribonucleotides which have
three prime ends that serve as primers

00:44:15.569 --> 00:44:15.579
three prime ends that serve as primers
 

00:44:15.579 --> 00:44:18.479
three prime ends that serve as primers
for initiation of DNA synthesis so the

00:44:18.479 --> 00:44:18.489
for initiation of DNA synthesis so the
 

00:44:18.489 --> 00:44:20.789
for initiation of DNA synthesis so the
DNA synthesis starts here and goes to

00:44:20.789 --> 00:44:20.799
DNA synthesis starts here and goes to
 

00:44:20.799 --> 00:44:23.579
DNA synthesis starts here and goes to
there and then it starts again further

00:44:23.579 --> 00:44:23.589
there and then it starts again further
 

00:44:23.589 --> 00:44:24.089
there and then it starts again further
upstream

00:44:24.089 --> 00:44:24.099
upstream
 

00:44:24.099 --> 00:44:25.829
upstream
you can only go there because you've

00:44:25.829 --> 00:44:25.839
you can only go there because you've
 

00:44:25.839 --> 00:44:27.390
you can only go there because you've
already synthesized that piece

00:44:27.390 --> 00:44:27.400
already synthesized that piece
 

00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:29.310
already synthesized that piece
the problem then becomes putting these

00:44:29.310 --> 00:44:29.320
the problem then becomes putting these
 

00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:31.620
the problem then becomes putting these
guys together and they're put together

00:44:31.620 --> 00:44:31.630
guys together and they're put together
 

00:44:31.630 --> 00:44:35.520
guys together and they're put together
because remember there's an rna-dna part

00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:35.530
because remember there's an rna-dna part
 

00:44:35.530 --> 00:44:37.980
because remember there's an rna-dna part
and what happens is the RNAs are removed

00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:37.990
and what happens is the RNAs are removed
 

00:44:37.990 --> 00:44:41.400
and what happens is the RNAs are removed
by specific X nucleus DNA is repaired

00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:41.410
by specific X nucleus DNA is repaired
 

00:44:41.410 --> 00:44:44.970
by specific X nucleus DNA is repaired
and who ligated and filled back in so

00:44:44.970 --> 00:44:44.980
and who ligated and filled back in so
 

00:44:44.980 --> 00:44:47.730
and who ligated and filled back in so
the leading strand is easy a preset

really not that hard so I've broken it

00:49:04.099 --> 00:49:04.109
really not that hard so I've broken it
 

00:49:04.109 --> 00:49:06.380

because you've got one strand that has a

00:49:55.759 --> 00:49:55.769
because you've got one strand that has a
 

00:49:55.769 --> 00:49:58.789
because you've got one strand that has a
little bit of RNA in it and a little bit

00:49:58.789 --> 00:49:58.799
little bit of RNA in it and a little bit
 

00:49:58.799 --> 00:50:01.489
little bit of RNA in it and a little bit
of DNA so the three point of that is

00:50:01.489 --> 00:50:01.499
of DNA so the three point of that is
 

00:50:01.499 --> 00:50:04.370
of DNA so the three point of that is
bound and PCNA is added on in the

triphosphates it synthesizes new DNA so

00:50:25.370 --> 00:50:25.380
triphosphates it synthesizes new DNA so
 

00:50:25.380 --> 00:50:27.259
triphosphates it synthesizes new DNA so
now we're making double-stranded DNA in

00:50:27.259 --> 00:50:27.269
now we're making double-stranded DNA in
 

00:50:27.269 --> 00:50:29.919
now we're making double-stranded DNA in

00:50:29.929 --> 00:50:32.390
this direction and in this direction
that's the leading strand and the

00:50:32.390 --> 00:50:32.400
that's the leading strand and the
 

00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:36.289
that's the leading strand and the
leading strand is elongated now once

this opens up then it frees the lagging

00:50:40.549 --> 00:50:40.559
this opens up then it frees the lagging
 

00:50:40.559 --> 00:50:42.799
this opens up then it frees the lagging
strand or it makes the lagging strand

00:50:42.799 --> 00:50:42.809
strand or it makes the lagging strand
 

00:50:42.809 --> 00:50:45.169

put in their RNA initiation nucleotides
 

00:50:53.369 --> 00:50:56.239
put in their RNA initiation nucleotides
so you get your rna-dna hybrid molecule

00:50:56.239 --> 00:50:56.249
so you get your rna-dna hybrid molecule
 

00:50:56.249 --> 00:50:58.370
so you get your rna-dna hybrid molecule
and it starts there and it's running in

00:50:58.370 --> 00:50:58.380
and it starts there and it's running in
 

00:50:58.380 --> 00:51:00.079
and it starts there and it's running in
the same direction and of course it runs

00:51:00.079 --> 00:51:00.089
the same direction and of course it runs
 

00:51:00.089 --> 00:51:01.549

out of room because it's already double

00:51:01.549 --> 00:51:01.559
out of room because it's already double
 

00:51:01.559 --> 00:51:04.760
out of room because it's already double
stranded on the leading strand so

00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:04.770
stranded on the leading strand so
 

00:51:04.770 --> 00:51:06.740
stranded on the leading strand so
start here you go to the origin origin

00:51:06.740 --> 00:51:06.750
start here you go to the origin origin
 

00:51:06.750 --> 00:51:10.280
start here you go to the origin origin
to stop and you start here you go back

00:51:10.280 --> 00:51:10.290
to stop and you start here you go back
 

00:51:10.290 --> 00:51:12.350
to stop and you start here you go back
to where this was made and you stop and

00:51:12.350 --> 00:51:12.360
to where this was made and you stop and
 

00:51:12.360 --> 00:51:14.150
to where this was made and you stop and
you start here and you continue in that

you start here and you continue in that
 

00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:16.700
you start here and you continue in that
process so it's really an ungainly way

00:51:16.700 --> 00:51:16.710
process so it's really an ungainly way
 

00:51:16.710 --> 00:51:18.170

series of stops and starts but it's the

00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:22.290
series of stops and starts but it's the
 

00:51:22.290 --> 00:51:23.540
series of stops and starts but it's the

this is all going on at the same time

00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:30.930
this is all going on at the same time
 

00:51:30.930 --> 00:51:32.840
this is all going on at the same time
the only thing is a little bit of a lag

00:51:32.840 --> 00:51:32.850
the only thing is a little bit of a lag
 

00:51:32.850 --> 00:51:34.880
the only thing is a little bit of a lag
in getting the lagging strand started

00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:34.890
in getting the lagging strand started
 

00:51:34.890 --> 00:51:36.380

formation of that Okazaki fragment fills
that thing in and then adds it back to

00:53:17.410 --> 00:53:17.420
that thing in and then adds it back to
 

00:53:17.420 --> 00:53:20.160
that thing in and then adds it back to
the molecule that's being replicated

00:53:20.160 --> 00:53:20.170
the molecule that's being replicated
 

00:53:20.170 --> 00:53:27.730

whoops didn't mean to do that

00:53:27.730 --> 00:53:27.740
 

00:53:27.740 --> 00:53:30.220
okay now you're left with the problem

00:53:30.220 --> 00:53:30.230
okay now you're left with the problem
 

00:53:30.230 --> 00:53:33.760
okay now you're left with the problem
you've made DNA you have a circular

00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:33.770
you've made DNA you have a circular
 

00:53:33.770 --> 00:53:36.280
you've made DNA you have a circular
molecule and if you make DNA from a

00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:36.290
molecule and if you make DNA from a
 

00:53:36.290 --> 00:53:41.940
molecule and if you make DNA from a
circular molecule what do you get anyone

00:53:41.940 --> 00:53:41.950
circular molecule what do you get anyone
 

00:53:41.950 --> 00:53:44.620
circular molecule what do you get anyone
you get another circular molecule right

00:53:44.620 --> 00:53:44.630
you get another circular molecule right
 

00:53:44.630 --> 00:53:47.230
you get another circular molecule right
so you have two circles and the problem

00:53:47.230 --> 00:53:47.240
so you have two circles and the problem
 

00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:50.320
so you have two circles and the problem
with these two circles is that they're

00:53:50.320 --> 00:53:50.330
with these two circles is that they're
 

00:53:50.330 --> 00:53:53.320
with these two circles is that they're
actually intertwine so you have to

00:53:53.320 --> 00:53:53.330
actually intertwine so you have to
 

00:53:53.330 --> 00:53:54.970
actually intertwine so you have to
separate daughter molecules from the

00:53:54.970 --> 00:53:54.980
separate daughter molecules from the
 

00:53:54.980 --> 00:53:57.370
separate daughter molecules from the
replication complex and that's where

00:53:57.370 --> 00:53:57.380
replication complex and that's where
 

00:53:57.380 --> 00:53:59.890
replication complex and that's where
enzymes such as topoisomerases come in

00:53:59.890 --> 00:53:59.900
enzymes such as topoisomerases come in
 

00:53:59.900 --> 00:54:02.620
enzymes such as topoisomerases come in
they relax these super coiled molecules

00:54:02.620 --> 00:54:02.630
they relax these super coiled molecules
 

00:54:02.630 --> 00:54:05.200
they relax these super coiled molecules
and they unwind them and what that does

00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:05.210
and they unwind them and what that does
 

00:54:05.210 --> 00:54:07.240
and they unwind them and what that does
is relieves torsional stress in the

00:54:07.240 --> 00:54:07.250
is relieves torsional stress in the
 

00:54:07.250 --> 00:54:10.000
is relieves torsional stress in the
molecules and permits them to come apart

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:10.010
molecules and permits them to come apart
 

00:54:10.010 --> 00:54:19.420
molecules and permits them to come apart
yes it only cuts one strand at a time so

00:54:19.420 --> 00:54:19.430
yes it only cuts one strand at a time so
 

00:54:19.430 --> 00:54:21.700
yes it only cuts one strand at a time so
it holds it intact it has a way of

it holds it intact it has a way of
 

00:54:21.710 --> 00:54:25.150
it holds it intact it has a way of
cutting and then cutting and even when

00:54:25.150 --> 00:54:25.160
cutting and then cutting and even when
 

00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:28.690
cutting and then cutting and even when
it cuts two strands are there top ones

00:54:28.690 --> 00:54:28.700
it cuts two strands are there top ones

inside of each other and you have to
 

00:54:53.720 --> 00:54:55.540
inside of each other and you have to
separate them out and that's what the

00:54:55.540 --> 00:54:55.550
separate them out and that's what the
 

00:54:55.550 --> 00:54:58.450

and finally we have DNA polymerase and

01:07:22.990 --> 01:07:23.000
and finally we have DNA polymerase and
 

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:24.940
and finally we have DNA polymerase and
you isolate all of these proteins and

01:07:24.940 --> 01:07:24.950
you isolate all of these proteins and
 

01:07:24.950 --> 01:07:26.740
you isolate all of these proteins and
you get the chemically pure and you

01:07:26.740 --> 01:07:26.750
you get the chemically pure and you
 

01:07:26.750 --> 01:07:29.260

you get nothing so it tells you that

01:07:35.589 --> 01:07:35.599
you get nothing so it tells you that
 

01:07:35.599 --> 01:07:37.030
you get nothing so it tells you that
their nests well it doesn't tell you

01:07:37.030 --> 01:07:37.040
their nests well it doesn't tell you
 

01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:37.990
their nests well it doesn't tell you
that they're necessary but not

01:07:37.990 --> 01:07:38.000
that they're necessary but not
 

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.089
that they're necessary but not
sufficient but it tells you that they

01:07:40.089 --> 01:07:40.099
sufficient but it tells you that they
 

01:07:40.099 --> 01:07:42.190

alone are not enough to replicate viral

01:07:42.190 --> 01:07:42.200
alone are not enough to replicate viral
 

01:07:42.200 --> 01:07:47.799
alone are not enough to replicate viral
DNA so what has been done is each one of

01:07:47.799 --> 01:07:47.809
DNA so what has been done is each one of
 

01:07:47.809 --> 01:07:51.190
DNA so what has been done is each one of
these gene products has been obtained

01:07:51.190 --> 01:07:51.200
these gene products has been obtained
 

01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:53.980
these gene products has been obtained
from or has been cloned the DNA that

01:07:53.980 --> 01:07:53.990
from or has been cloned the DNA that
 

01:07:53.990 --> 01:07:56.140
from or has been cloned the DNA that
encodes it has been cloned and those

01:07:56.140 --> 01:07:56.150
encodes it has been cloned and those
 

01:07:56.150 --> 01:07:58.299
encodes it has been cloned and those
clones have been transformed into

01:07:58.299 --> 01:07:58.309
clones have been transformed into
 

01:07:58.309 --> 01:08:01.870
clones have been transformed into
mammalian cells along with a plasmid

01:08:01.870 --> 01:08:01.880
mammalian cells along with a plasmid
 

01:08:01.880 --> 01:08:04.000
mammalian cells along with a plasmid
that has an origin of replication and

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:04.010
that has an origin of replication and
 

01:08:04.010 --> 01:08:07.030
that has an origin of replication and
DNA that's made in plasmids is cleaved

01:08:07.030 --> 01:08:07.040
DNA that's made in plasmids is cleaved
 

01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:09.910
DNA that's made in plasmids is cleaved
by an enzyme called DPN one which only

01:08:09.910 --> 01:08:09.920
by an enzyme called DPN one which only
 

01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:12.400
by an enzyme called DPN one which only
recognizes methylated ad names and

01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:12.410
recognizes methylated ad names and
 

01:08:12.410 --> 01:08:14.680
recognizes methylated ad names and
mammalian cells don't have methylated ad

01:08:14.680 --> 01:08:14.690
mammalian cells don't have methylated ad
 

01:08:14.690 --> 01:08:17.019
mammalian cells don't have methylated ad
means they only methylated site of him

01:08:17.019 --> 01:08:17.029
means they only methylated site of him
 

01:08:17.029 --> 01:08:21.880
means they only methylated site of him
and so if DNA replicates then this

01:08:21.880 --> 01:08:21.890
and so if DNA replicates then this
 

01:08:21.890 --> 01:08:24.309
and so if DNA replicates then this
plasmid molecule this is a southern blot

01:08:24.309 --> 01:08:24.319
plasmid molecule this is a southern blot
 

01:08:24.319 --> 01:08:27.249
plasmid molecule this is a southern blot
after cleavage with DPN will no longer

01:08:27.249 --> 01:08:27.259
after cleavage with DPN will no longer
 

01:08:27.259 --> 01:08:32.410
after cleavage with DPN will no longer
be cleaved so this plasmid sequence will

01:08:32.410 --> 01:08:32.420
be cleaved so this plasmid sequence will
 

01:08:32.420 --> 01:08:36.220
be cleaved so this plasmid sequence will
be copied and you'll make thousands of

01:08:36.220 --> 01:08:36.230
be copied and you'll make thousands of
 

01:08:36.230 --> 01:08:38.169
be copied and you'll make thousands of
copies of it but only the original

01:08:38.169 --> 01:08:38.179
copies of it but only the original
 

01:08:38.179 --> 01:08:41.740
copies of it but only the original
plasmid sequence from eco I will be

01:08:41.740 --> 01:08:41.750
plasmid sequence from eco I will be
 

01:08:41.750 --> 01:08:44.860
plasmid sequence from eco I will be
cleaved so here it is thrown into a cell

01:08:44.860 --> 01:08:44.870
cleaved so here it is thrown into a cell
 

01:08:44.870 --> 01:08:47.200
cleaved so here it is thrown into a cell
with any one of those seven gene

01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:47.210
with any one of those seven gene
 

01:08:47.210 --> 01:08:49.180
with any one of those seven gene
products left out with any one of those

01:08:49.180 --> 01:08:49.190
products left out with any one of those
 

01:08:49.190 --> 01:08:50.950
products left out with any one of those
seven genes left out you get no

01:08:50.950 --> 01:08:50.960
seven genes left out you get no
 

01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:53.019
seven genes left out you get no
replication if you have all of them in

01:08:53.019 --> 01:08:53.029
replication if you have all of them in
 

01:08:53.029 --> 01:08:54.729
replication if you have all of them in
the mixture that is a mixture of cloned

01:08:54.729 --> 01:08:54.739
the mixture that is a mixture of cloned
 

01:08:54.739 --> 01:08:57.220
the mixture that is a mixture of cloned
fragments plus template then you see

01:08:57.220 --> 01:08:57.230
fragments plus template then you see
 

01:08:57.230 --> 01:08:59.709
fragments plus template then you see
replication so this is termed DPN one

01:08:59.709 --> 01:08:59.719
replication so this is termed DPN one
 

01:08:59.719 --> 01:09:01.050
replication so this is termed DPN one
resistant

01:09:01.050 --> 01:09:01.060

and that's how we know that these guys

01:09:02.400 --> 01:09:02.410
and that's how we know that these guys
 

01:09:02.410 --> 01:09:04.590
and that's how we know that these guys
are important for replication we just

01:09:04.590 --> 01:09:04.600
are important for replication we just
 

01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:06.210
are important for replication we just
don't know all of the host components

01:09:06.210 --> 01:09:06.220
don't know all of the host components
 

01:09:06.220 --> 01:09:10.470
don't know all of the host components
that are also important
