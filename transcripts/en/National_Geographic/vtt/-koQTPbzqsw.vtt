00:00:02.367 --> 00:00:06.033
NARRATOR: The myth is that,
as the agribusinesses benefit,

00:00:06.033 --> 00:00:07.800
the communities benefit.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.100
How's the water at the school?

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.800
Do you guys drink the
water at the school?

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:11.900
CHILDREN: No!
It's nasty!

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:12.800
It tastes like blood?

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:13.867
CHILD: It tastes nasty!

00:00:13.867 --> 00:00:14.767
Nasty.

00:00:14.767 --> 00:00:17.000
It tastes like oxygen.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.433
But in the case
of the Resnicks,

00:00:18.433 --> 00:00:22.200
even with their slideshow
ready charity, no.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.300
You see that the Resnicks
jump up the Forbes list

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.133
of billionaires, and
the workers can't

00:00:27.133 --> 00:00:28.533
even drink their tap water.

00:00:32.734 --> 00:00:35.734
And the ironies couldn't be
sharper, because the California

00:00:35.734 --> 00:00:40.400
aqueduct literally flows through
town, delivering high quality,

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.867
dirt cheap, subsidized
northern California

00:00:42.867 --> 00:00:46.700
rainwater to the fields
of Paramount Farming.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.900
But it's not an
aberration in the system.

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.233
It's the whole model.

00:01:01.233 --> 00:01:05.734
It's not designed or
geared to build communities

00:01:05.734 --> 00:01:06.800
and to treat people well.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.500
It's designed and
geared to make money.
