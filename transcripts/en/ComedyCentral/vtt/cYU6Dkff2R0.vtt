00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.102
- Hey, hey, welcome to Every Damn Day.

00:00:02.102 --> 00:00:04.338
We're gonna be dedicating
our entire episode

00:00:04.338 --> 00:00:08.242
to talking about how Banksy
just redid the American flag.

00:00:08.242 --> 00:00:09.743
Guys, what do we think?

00:00:09.743 --> 00:00:10.544
(groans)
- Cool.

00:00:10.544 --> 00:00:11.378
- I guess.
- Okay.

00:00:11.378 --> 00:00:12.746
- Cool.
- Whatever.

00:00:14.047 --> 00:00:16.984
- Okay, I guess those
are all of our thoughts,

00:00:16.984 --> 00:00:18.452
so the show is done now.

00:00:18.452 --> 00:00:19.720
Like, comment, and subscribe.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:20.888
- Cut!

00:00:20.888 --> 00:00:23.090
Guys, what the hell?

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:24.625
This is a discussion show.

00:00:24.625 --> 00:00:27.427
You need opinions, and personality,

00:00:27.427 --> 00:00:28.662
and a passion for the issues,

00:00:28.662 --> 00:00:31.732
not in an annoying way,
like Ryan, obviously.

00:00:31.732 --> 00:00:33.734
But, can we pull something together?

00:00:33.734 --> 00:00:36.069
Like 60 Minutes, but for memes.

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:37.304
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

00:00:37.304 --> 00:00:38.405
- Yeah.
- Sure.

00:00:38.405 --> 00:00:40.974
(upbeat music)

00:00:43.243 --> 00:00:47.114
- Okay gang, so, you all
need to develop personalities

00:00:47.114 --> 00:00:49.683
because you are boring and unrelatable.

00:00:49.683 --> 00:00:53.053
To do that, why don't we
brainstorm some character traits

00:00:53.053 --> 00:00:56.623
for each of you that we can
use to write fun, new segments?

00:00:56.623 --> 00:00:58.725
Sound good?
- Oh, I have one.

00:00:58.725 --> 00:01:01.028
Ryan, you resemble a sickly bird

00:01:01.028 --> 00:01:03.196
that turned into a sicker human,

00:01:03.196 --> 00:01:05.499
so, what if we did a segment called,

00:01:05.499 --> 00:01:08.235
Ryan eats worms on camera?

00:01:08.235 --> 00:01:09.469
(hands clap)
- Good, good,

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:11.672
I like that a lot, that's really great!

00:01:11.672 --> 00:01:12.639
How about Natasha?

00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:14.274
- Hm, what if we did something about

00:01:14.274 --> 00:01:16.910
how Natasha's become a really good actor,

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.979
because she has no personality of her own

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:21.448
and is hiding the fact
that she's a sociopath?

00:01:21.448 --> 00:01:23.650
(all laughing)

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.486
(Natasha cackles)

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:30.891
What, come on!

00:01:30.891 --> 00:01:33.226
You guys crack me up, me normal.

00:01:33.226 --> 00:01:35.262
- This is great, really good stuff.

00:01:35.262 --> 00:01:37.331
Let's keep it going, how 'bout Chris?

00:01:37.331 --> 00:01:39.666
- Well, Chris is a loser
conspiracy theorist

00:01:39.666 --> 00:01:42.736
who watches Illuminati
listicles on YouTube, so--

00:01:42.736 --> 00:01:43.704
- No I don't!

00:01:43.704 --> 00:01:44.671
- You're watching a video called,

00:01:44.671 --> 00:01:47.441
10 Reasons Stuart Little is Illuminati.

00:01:47.441 --> 00:01:49.476
- I mean, but, how he get
those clothes, though?

00:01:49.476 --> 00:01:50.777
- And Hannah, you were kinda mean to me

00:01:50.777 --> 00:01:52.179
from the start and everyone in the office

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:53.080
thinks you're an asshole,

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.549
so let's just do a segment about that.

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:56.917
- Ouch, that stings.

00:01:56.917 --> 00:01:59.453
But without honesty there
isn't personal growth.

00:02:00.821 --> 00:02:01.788
- Hey, what's up guys?

00:02:01.788 --> 00:02:03.290
It's me, Roy Wood, Jr., Daily Show,

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:04.458
just wanted to pop in real quick,

00:02:04.458 --> 00:02:07.327
let you know that you're
all deeply flawed.

00:02:07.327 --> 00:02:08.829
'Cept for Jordy Pizza here.

00:02:08.829 --> 00:02:10.364
He's my best friend.

00:02:10.364 --> 00:02:11.431
- Thanks, Roy Wood, Jr.

00:02:11.431 --> 00:02:13.233
See ya at lunch?
- I'm buyin'.

00:02:13.233 --> 00:02:15.969
(hands slapping)

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.905
- Get it together.

00:02:18.905 --> 00:02:20.874
- And my character trait is,

00:02:20.874 --> 00:02:22.009
I'm kinda the funny one in the group,

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:23.443
so let's just roll with that.

00:02:23.443 --> 00:02:24.277
- Ha, ha!

00:02:24.277 --> 00:02:25.645
Sounds good, and truthful.

00:02:25.645 --> 00:02:27.814
In fact, I just got an
email from the execs

00:02:27.814 --> 00:02:29.983
that said Jordan is getting his own show!

00:02:29.983 --> 00:02:31.451
Three cheers for Jordan!

00:02:31.451 --> 00:02:32.853
Yay!

00:02:32.853 --> 00:02:35.188
(cheers)

00:02:35.188 --> 00:02:36.623
(triumphant music)

00:02:36.623 --> 00:02:39.559
- [Everyone] Jordan, Jordy, Jordan.

00:02:40.527 --> 00:02:43.597
(bright piano music)

00:02:45.632 --> 00:02:49.736
- Then we fade out, the end.

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:53.840
(clapping)

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:54.674
Woo!

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:59.279
Really great table read, guys, like bravo!

00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:00.280
- You wrote a script that ends

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.615
with you getting your own show?

00:03:01.615 --> 00:03:04.184
- You really think you're the, funny one?

00:03:04.184 --> 00:03:05.952
- Yeah, all of your
character traits you wrote

00:03:05.952 --> 00:03:08.021
were just criticisms of everyone else.

00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:08.855
- That's not my fault.

00:03:08.855 --> 00:03:10.924
I just couldn't think of
anything negative about myself.

00:03:10.924 --> 00:03:12.025
- I've got an idea.

00:03:12.025 --> 00:03:14.428
Why don't we list a
few of Jordan's traits?

00:03:14.428 --> 00:03:16.196
- Well, you don't take criticism well,

00:03:16.196 --> 00:03:17.564
and you get really defensive.

00:03:17.564 --> 00:03:20.133
- That's not (bleep) true, you bitch!

00:03:20.133 --> 00:03:23.870
- Plus your mustache look
like 15 ants died on your lip.

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:24.905
(chuckles)

00:03:24.905 --> 00:03:28.075
- You dress like a Mr. Rogers
that no one would mourn.

00:03:28.075 --> 00:03:30.177
And Mr. Rogers is my taxidermist.

00:03:30.177 --> 00:03:32.679
- I bet you can only
get your girlfriend wet

00:03:32.679 --> 00:03:35.115
with your tears.
- Who told you that?

00:03:35.115 --> 00:03:37.651
(laughing)

00:03:37.651 --> 00:03:39.519
- (cackles) That's funny as hell, Hannah.

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:41.822
(hands slapping) That's all right, my dog.

00:03:45.525 --> 00:03:47.561
I don't know you, Jordan.

00:03:47.561 --> 00:03:50.363
And you're not my friend. (spits)

00:03:52.666 --> 00:03:55.168
- Okay, great work, lots of good ideas.

00:03:57.204 --> 00:03:59.306
- I guess they're not gonna use my script.

00:04:00.841 --> 00:04:01.875
Or will they?

00:04:02.976 --> 00:04:06.746
(upbeat instrumental music)
