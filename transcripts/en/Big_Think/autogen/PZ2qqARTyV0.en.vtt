we love to read about how useless pandas

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980

are at sex I think it makes us feel

00:03:42.339 --> 00:03:42.349
are at sex I think it makes us feel
 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:44.170
are at sex I think it makes us feel
better about ourselves quite frankly and

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180
better about ourselves quite frankly and
 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.899
better about ourselves quite frankly and
so yeah I think I think it helps us feel

00:03:46.899 --> 00:03:46.909
so yeah I think I think it helps us feel
 

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:49.689

superior actually and so you know those

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:49.699
superior actually and so you know those
 

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:51.879
superior actually and so you know those
those stories are incredibly popular and

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:51.889
those stories are incredibly popular and
 

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:53.979
those stories are incredibly popular and
so we we have this idea that there's

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989
so we we have this idea that there's
 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:56.469
so we we have this idea that there's
this this bear that is somehow hopeless

00:03:56.469 --> 00:03:56.479
this this bear that is somehow hopeless
 

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:58.599
this this bear that is somehow hopeless

just be a means of of controlling the
 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.850
just be a means of of controlling the
population size because the male panda

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860
population size because the male panda
 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.480
population size because the male panda
is in fact so virile that panda sperm is

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490
is in fact so virile that panda sperm is

they're not hopeless evolutionary losers
so so the problem with a lot of Chinese

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:49.980
so so the problem with a lot of Chinese
 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:54.650
so so the problem with a lot of Chinese
panda conservation is that it revolves

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660
panda conservation is that it revolves
 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:59.150
panda conservation is that it revolves
around captive breeding and the Chinese

00:04:59.150 --> 00:04:59.160
around captive breeding and the Chinese
 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.120
around captive breeding and the Chinese

I went about ten years ago and I was
 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:41.270
I went about ten years ago and I was
astonished when I visited because they

astonished when I visited because they
 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.570
astonished when I visited because they

pandas now the reason why they're so
 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:58.700
pandas now the reason why they're so
successful is because they're using

00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:58.710
successful is because they're using
 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:02.690

you have all these baby pandas being

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:03.780
you have all these baby pandas being

no wild pandas there teaching them how

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:10.500
no wild pandas there teaching them how
 

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:13.070
no wild pandas there teaching them how
to be wild pandas and of course this is

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:13.080
to be wild pandas and of course this is
 

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:17.860
to be wild pandas and of course this is
the problem is that you know animals

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:17.870
the problem is that you know animals
 

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:22.550
the problem is that you know animals
might physically be there but it's the

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:22.560
might physically be there but it's the
 

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.260
might physically be there but it's the
behavior that makes an animal as well

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:24.270
behavior that makes an animal as well
 

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:27.320
behavior that makes an animal as well
and and the behavior has to be some

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:27.330
and and the behavior has to be some
 

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:30.050
and and the behavior has to be some
behavior is innate of course but a large

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:30.060
behavior is innate of course but a large
 

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:33.980
behavior is innate of course but a large
amount of behavior is learned and so you

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:33.990
amount of behavior is learned and so you
 

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:36.200
amount of behavior is learned and so you
know these these pandas that are bred in

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:36.210
know these these pandas that are bred in
 

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:40.070
know these these pandas that are bred in
these but effectively panda mills they

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:40.080
these but effectively panda mills they
 

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:42.970
these but effectively panda mills they
look like pandas but they aren't really

00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:42.980
look like pandas but they aren't really
 

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:44.870
look like pandas but they aren't really
pandas because they don't know how to

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:44.880
pandas because they don't know how to
 

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:47.240
pandas because they don't know how to
behave like pandas so when they're

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:47.250
behave like pandas so when they're
 

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:51.110
behave like pandas so when they're
released into the wild they don't know

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:51.120
released into the wild they don't know
 

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:53.630
released into the wild they don't know
how to behave they you know these are

00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:53.640
how to behave they you know these are
 

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:55.430
how to behave they you know these are
the although they're fairly solitary

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:55.440
the although they're fairly solitary
 

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:58.220
the although they're fairly solitary
they're still social enough that you

00:07:58.220 --> 00:07:58.230
they're still social enough that you
 

00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:00.710
they're still social enough that you
know pandas need to know how to you know

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:00.720
know pandas need to know how to you know
 

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:05.120
know pandas need to know how to you know

stepped on if they Davin learnt how to

stepped on if they Davin learnt how to
behave in that way then they're never

behave in that way then they're never
 

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:15.970
behave in that way then they're never
going to survive and in fact the first

captive raised panda that was released
 

00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:21.890
captive raised panda that was released
by the Chinese it was unfortunately

00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:21.900
by the Chinese it was unfortunately
 

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:23.810
by the Chinese it was unfortunately
called lucky but it was anything but

00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:23.820
called lucky but it was anything but
 

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:26.420
called lucky but it was anything but
because it ended up being savaged to

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:26.430
because it ended up being savaged to
 

00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:32.209
because it ended up being savaged to
death by wild pandas so it's difficult

00:08:32.209 --> 00:08:32.219
death by wild pandas so it's difficult
 

00:08:32.219 --> 00:08:34.580
death by wild pandas so it's difficult
because these captive bred populations

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:34.590
because these captive bred populations
 

00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:37.130
because these captive bred populations
are now a long line of animals that have

are now a long line of animals that have
 

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:39.800
are now a long line of animals that have
been bred in captivity their wildness is

00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:39.810
been bred in captivity their wildness is
 

00:08:39.810 --> 00:08:44.540
been bred in captivity their wildness is
sort of disappearing you know and with
