00:00:00.468 --> 00:00:04.160
- Line segments IN, this
is segment IN over here,

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.575
and TO, this is TO here,

00:00:06.575 --> 00:00:07.991
are reflected over the line

00:00:07.991 --> 00:00:10.661
Y is equal to negative X minus two.

00:00:10.661 --> 00:00:12.589
So this is the line that
they're reflected about

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:14.214
this dashed, purple line.

00:00:14.214 --> 00:00:17.070
And it is indeed Y equals
negative X minus two.

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.927
This right over here is
in slope intercept form.

00:00:18.927 --> 00:00:20.646
The slope should be negative one,

00:00:20.646 --> 00:00:22.248
and we see that the
slope of this purple line

00:00:22.248 --> 00:00:23.850
is indeed negative one.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.313
If X changes by a certain amount,

00:00:25.313 --> 00:00:26.984
Y changes by the negative of that.

00:00:26.984 --> 00:00:30.142
If X changes by one, Y
changes by negative one

00:00:30.142 --> 00:00:31.721
to get back to that line.

00:00:31.721 --> 00:00:33.021
If X changes by positive two,

00:00:33.021 --> 00:00:34.832
Y changes by negative two

00:00:34.832 --> 00:00:37.154
to get back to another point on that line.

00:00:37.154 --> 00:00:38.756
And the Y intercept?

00:00:38.756 --> 00:00:40.591
We see when X is equal to zero,

00:00:40.591 --> 00:00:41.891
Y should be negative two.

00:00:41.891 --> 00:00:43.331
When X is equal to zero,

00:00:43.331 --> 00:00:44.817
Y is indeed negative two.

00:00:44.817 --> 00:00:45.954
So we've validated that.

00:00:45.954 --> 00:00:48.160
Then they say, "Draw the
image of this reflection,

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.203
using the interactive graph."

00:00:50.203 --> 00:00:53.059
Alright, so we can move
these lines around,

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:54.731
and we want to reflect these.

00:00:54.731 --> 00:00:56.380
And I could try to eyeball it, you know,

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.446
maybe it's something like this.

00:00:58.446 --> 00:01:00.327
I don't know, it doesn't exactly right.

00:01:00.327 --> 00:01:03.113
That looks close to the reflection of IN,

00:01:03.113 --> 00:01:06.689
and for TO I'd want to
move this down here.

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.709
TO looks like it would be,

00:01:08.709 --> 00:01:10.125
I don't know, I'm eyeballing it.

00:01:10.125 --> 00:01:13.260
This is close, but it can't be close.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.653
I want to get exact.

00:01:14.653 --> 00:01:17.300
So let's, I've copied and
pasted the original problem

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.547
on my scratch pad so we
can find the exact points

00:01:19.547 --> 00:01:22.171
and so I don't just have to estimate this.

00:01:22.171 --> 00:01:23.908
So let's go to the scratch pad.

00:01:23.908 --> 00:01:25.626
So exactly what we just saw.

00:01:25.626 --> 00:01:27.368
And the main realization is,

00:01:27.368 --> 00:01:29.411
is that if we want to
reflect a given point,

00:01:29.411 --> 00:01:31.245
if we want to reflect a given point,

00:01:31.245 --> 00:01:32.940
say point I right over here,

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:33.985
what we want to do

00:01:33.985 --> 00:01:36.353
is we want to drop a perpendicular.

00:01:36.353 --> 00:01:38.234
We want to find a line
that's perpendicular,

00:01:38.234 --> 00:01:40.765
or a line that has the point I on it,

00:01:40.765 --> 00:01:43.505
and it's perpendicular to
this line right over here.

00:01:43.505 --> 00:01:45.270
Remember this is the line,

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.522
let me do this is that purple color.

00:01:47.522 --> 00:01:51.910
This is the line, Y is equal
to negative X minus two.

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:56.673
Its slope is equal to negative one.

00:01:56.673 --> 00:01:59.718
So I want a line that
goes through I, point I,

00:01:59.718 --> 00:02:04.222
that is perpendicular to this line,

00:02:04.222 --> 00:02:05.778
and I want to drop it,

00:02:05.778 --> 00:02:07.659
I want to drop it to,

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:10.329
I want to drop it to the line
that I'm going to reflect on,

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:11.792
and then I'm going to go the same distance

00:02:11.792 --> 00:02:13.510
onto the other side to find

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.849
to find the corresponding
point in the image.

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:18.329
So how do I do that?

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:20.628
Well if this line, if this purple line

00:02:20.628 --> 00:02:21.998
has a slope of negative one,

00:02:21.998 --> 00:02:26.192
a line that is perpendicular to it

00:02:26.192 --> 00:02:27.940
a line that is perpendicular to it

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.192
so this thing that I'm drawing
in purple right over here,

00:02:30.192 --> 00:02:33.164
its slope is going to be the
negative reciprocal of this.

00:02:33.164 --> 00:02:34.975
So the reciprocal of negative one

00:02:34.975 --> 00:02:36.206
is still just negative one.

00:02:36.206 --> 00:02:37.669
One over negative one
is still negative one.

00:02:37.669 --> 00:02:39.317
But we want the negative of that.

00:02:39.317 --> 00:02:41.035
So the slope here needs to be one.

00:02:41.035 --> 00:02:42.963
And luckily, that's how I drew it.

00:02:42.963 --> 00:02:45.586
The slope here needs to be equal to one

00:02:45.586 --> 00:02:47.931
which is however much I
change in the X direction

00:02:47.931 --> 00:02:48.999
I change in the Y direction.

00:02:48.999 --> 00:02:49.766
We see that.

00:02:49.766 --> 00:02:52.088
To go from this point to
this point right over here,

00:02:52.088 --> 00:02:55.324
we decrease Y by four

00:02:55.324 --> 00:02:58.384
and we decrease X by four.

00:02:58.384 --> 00:03:00.869
Now, if we want to stay on this line

00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:03.492
to find the reflection,
we just do the same thing.

00:03:03.492 --> 00:03:06.789
We could decrease X by four,

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:09.042
so we'll go from negative
two to negative six,

00:03:09.042 --> 00:03:10.806
and decrease Y by four,

00:03:10.806 --> 00:03:13.709
and we end up at this
point right over here.

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:15.241
So we end up at the point,

00:03:15.241 --> 00:03:18.561
this is X equals negative six,
Y is equal to negative four.

00:03:18.561 --> 00:03:21.185
So this is, this point corresponds

00:03:21.185 --> 00:03:23.368
to this point right over there.

00:03:23.368 --> 00:03:24.807
Now, let's do the same thing.

00:03:24.807 --> 00:03:27.570
Let's do the same thing for point N.

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.916
For point N, we already know,

00:03:29.916 --> 00:03:32.237
if we drop a perpendicular,

00:03:32.237 --> 00:03:34.908
and this is perpendicular, it's
going to have a slope of one

00:03:34.908 --> 00:03:36.974
because this purple line
has a slope of negative one.

00:03:36.974 --> 00:03:40.109
The negative reciprocal of
negative one is positive one.

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:42.407
And let's see, to go from this point

00:03:42.407 --> 00:03:44.497
to this point of intersection,

00:03:44.497 --> 00:03:47.725
we have to go down one and a half.

00:03:47.725 --> 00:03:49.954
We're going down one and a half,

00:03:49.954 --> 00:03:52.438
and we're going to the
left one and a half.

00:03:52.438 --> 00:03:54.040
So we want to do that on the other side.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.642
We want to stay on this
perpendicular line.

00:03:55.642 --> 00:03:57.918
So we want to go left one and a half,

00:03:57.918 --> 00:04:00.031
and down one and a half.

00:04:00.031 --> 00:04:03.026
And we get to this point right
over here, which is the point

00:04:03.026 --> 00:04:07.554
X equals three, Y is
equal to negative eight.

00:04:07.554 --> 00:04:09.550
So we are now equidistant.

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:11.337
We're on this perpendicular line, still,

00:04:11.337 --> 00:04:14.402
but we're equidistant on the other side.

00:04:14.402 --> 00:04:17.235
So the image of IN is going to go through

00:04:17.235 --> 00:04:20.091
negative six, negative four,
and three, negative eight.

00:04:20.091 --> 00:04:22.339
So let me draw that.

00:04:22.339 --> 00:04:23.077
Let me see if I can remember,

00:04:23.077 --> 00:04:26.049
negative six, negative four,
and three, negative eight.

00:04:26.049 --> 00:04:27.883
So I have a bad memory.

00:04:27.883 --> 00:04:32.778
So negative six, negative four,
and three, negative eight.

00:04:32.778 --> 00:04:33.856
And I was close when I estimated,

00:04:33.856 --> 00:04:35.564
but I wasn't exactly right.

00:04:35.564 --> 00:04:38.570
So that's looking pretty good.

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:40.427
And actually, we can
do the exact same thing

00:04:40.427 --> 00:04:42.587
with points T and point O.

00:04:42.587 --> 00:04:44.119
Let me do that.

00:04:44.119 --> 00:04:46.557
So point T, to point T,

00:04:46.557 --> 00:04:50.133
To get from point T to the
line in the shortest distance,

00:04:50.133 --> 00:04:51.758
once again, we drop a perpendicular.

00:04:51.758 --> 00:04:53.987
This line is going to have a slope of one,

00:04:53.987 --> 00:04:55.891
because it's perpendicular to the line

00:04:55.891 --> 00:04:57.423
that has a slope of negative one.

00:04:57.423 --> 00:05:01.117
And so to get there, we
have to decrease our X by

00:05:01.117 --> 00:05:02.323
we have to decrease our X.

00:05:02.323 --> 00:05:04.045
We're going from X
equals five to X equals,

00:05:04.045 --> 00:05:05.456
it looks like, half.

00:05:05.456 --> 00:05:09.891
So X went down by four and
a half in the X direction

00:05:09.891 --> 00:05:12.492
and Y also needs to go
down by four and a half.

00:05:12.492 --> 00:05:13.954
So if we want to stay on that line,

00:05:13.954 --> 00:05:16.253
let's decrease our X by four and a half.

00:05:16.253 --> 00:05:19.388
So that's half, one, two, three, four.

00:05:19.388 --> 00:05:21.617
And Y needs to go down by four and a half.

00:05:21.617 --> 00:05:25.216
So that's half, one, two, three, four,

00:05:25.216 --> 00:05:26.980
and we get to this point right over here,

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:30.486
which is the point X equals negative four,

00:05:30.486 --> 00:05:34.201
Y is equal to negative seven.

00:05:34.201 --> 00:05:36.123
And it's negative four, negative seven.

00:05:36.123 --> 00:05:38.190
Let me, so this should be at,

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:41.951
X equals negative four,
Y equals negative seven.

00:05:41.951 --> 00:05:43.879
And there's a couple of
things you could do here.

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:45.481
You could just say, hey, this is two long,

00:05:45.481 --> 00:05:48.843
or two units long, not like,
too long in length, somehow.

00:05:48.843 --> 00:05:51.211
This is two units long, so
maybe this is two units long.

00:05:51.211 --> 00:05:52.604
So this is feeling pretty good.

00:05:52.604 --> 00:05:55.483
But let's just go through the
exercise for point O as well.

00:05:55.483 --> 00:05:58.177
So point O, once again,
this is going to have,

00:05:58.177 --> 00:06:00.173
if we drop a perpendicular,

00:06:00.173 --> 00:06:02.054
it's going to have a slope of one.

00:06:02.054 --> 00:06:04.794
So whatever our change
in X between this point

00:06:04.794 --> 00:06:05.718
and this point, we're going to have

00:06:05.718 --> 00:06:07.757
the same change in Y.

00:06:07.757 --> 00:06:12.026
And our change in X,
to go from seven to...

00:06:12.026 --> 00:06:14.719
Seven to one and a half,

00:06:14.719 --> 00:06:17.343
our change in X is five and a half.

00:06:17.343 --> 00:06:19.642
So then we do it this way.

00:06:19.642 --> 00:06:21.453
So the change in X here,

00:06:21.453 --> 00:06:26.166
so the change in X is equal
to negative five and a half,

00:06:26.166 --> 00:06:27.815
five point five.

00:06:27.815 --> 00:06:29.301
If you subtract five
point five from seven,

00:06:29.301 --> 00:06:30.624
you get to one point five.

00:06:30.624 --> 00:06:32.366
And our change in Y.

00:06:32.366 --> 00:06:35.268
Our change in Y is also
negative five point five.

00:06:35.268 --> 00:06:37.125
Change is Y is negative,

00:06:37.125 --> 00:06:37.831
you're not going to see that

00:06:37.831 --> 00:06:38.620
so I'm going to do it differently,

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:41.198
negative five point five.

00:06:41.198 --> 00:06:43.171
And so we need to stay on this line.

00:06:43.171 --> 00:06:45.772
So we need to change by those same amounts

00:06:45.772 --> 00:06:47.444
onto the other side of that line.

00:06:47.444 --> 00:06:50.532
So if we decrease our
X by five and a half.

00:06:50.532 --> 00:06:54.502
So half, one, two, three,
four, five, we get there,

00:06:54.502 --> 00:06:56.383
and Y by five and a half,

00:06:56.383 --> 00:06:59.410
half, one, two,

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:02.126
three, four, five.

00:07:02.126 --> 00:07:04.889
We get to the point, X
equals negative four,

00:07:04.889 --> 00:07:08.349
Y is equal to negative nine.

00:07:08.349 --> 00:07:11.646
So we get to the point
X equals negative four,

00:07:11.646 --> 00:07:13.736
Y is equal to negative
nine, and we're done!

00:07:13.736 --> 00:07:17.863
We have figured out the
reflection of these two segments.
