00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.920
Adorable story alert!

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.810
So I was hanging out with my 2-year-old second
cousin in the ocean in Florida

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:08.950
and we're jumping up and down with the waves and it's fun but then the water got all calm and I said,

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:13.800
"Oh, no more waves!," because, like, that's the top tier of communication I'm going for with a 2-year-old,

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.500
but then he said "Don't worry, there'll be
more!"

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.390
And I was like, "How do you know?"

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.279
And he was like, "It's a cycle!"

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.390
Yes! It is a cycle!
The Earth is filled with cycles!

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.550
And if my 2-year-old second cousin knows it
you should know it too!

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.589
The universe is the great recycler.

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:33.170
All of the stuff we have on Earth, every last
particle of matter or calorie of energy has

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:34.480
been around since the Big Bang.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.829
It just keeps getting repurposed over and
over again.

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:40.280
And when it comes to matter, at least, the
Earth is essentially a closed system.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.920
All the matter gets passed around in continuous
biogeochemical cycles,

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.570
which are pathways for molecules like water
or elements like carbon and nitrogen and phosphorous

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.930
to move through all of the Earth's various
ecological and geological compartments.

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.390
Now of course we couldn't possibly talk about how all matter gets cycled around Earth in one video,

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.269
'cause the Earth is pretty big,

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:03.289
but consider this as an introduction to biogeochemical
cycles starring my two personal favorites:

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:04.800
carbon and water.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:14.460
[Theme Music]

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.540
Now I'm sure you already know about at least
one type of planet-wide recycling because

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:19.250
it's the most obvious to us:

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.200
the hydrologic cycle which describes how water moves on, above, and below the surface of the Earth

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.040
driven by the energy supplied by the Sun and
the wind.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.390
In talking about the hydrologic cycle it's
most useful to think about all of the water

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.110
on Earth being held in a series of reservoirs.

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.430
The ocean, for instance, or the atmosphere
in the form of clouds or in polar ice caps.

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.200
So not only does water cycle through different
places,

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.890
it also takes different forms in different
places in the cycle: liquid, solid, or gas.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.750
And since it's a cycle there is no beginning and no end, so where we start our discussion is arbitrary,

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.780
but we're going to start it off with precipitation.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.080
Rain, hail, snow, sleet, graupel, all of that
stuff is precipitation.

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.210
It happens when water that's being held in
the atmosphere condenses,

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.740
or turns from a gas into a liquid and then occasionally freezes into a solid, right up in the air.

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.420
The opposite of condensation, of course, it
evaporation, the conversion of a liquid into a gas

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.720
and when a substance converts straight from
a solid to a gas that's sublimation

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.230
and when it's from a gas to a solid that's
deposition.

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.000
And now you know.
But back to condensation.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.340
It is responsible for the formation of clouds,

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.640
which happens when air containing water vapor rises and cools,

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.280
or is compressed to the point that it can no longer be a gas.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.250
At this point, the vapor forms droplets.

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.820
This is the same thing you see happening on
your glass of ice tea on a humid day.

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.540
The water in the air around the glass gets
cold, and turns from gas into liquid.

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:37.500
So a cloud is just a big pile of condensed water droplets, in a sense, it's a gigantic floating reservoir.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.900
Clouds are a handy feature of the hydrologic
cycle,

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.140
because as they drift over the landscape they
move water around the globe.

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.460
So water that evaporates over the ocean can
be deposited somewhere else.

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.220
Otherwise, if water always got deposited right
where it evaporated,

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.000
the precipitation would be almost always right
over the ocean,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.640
because that's where most of the evaporation
on Earth takes place.

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.400
So wind moves clouds, and as water keeps condensing
clouds get heavier and heavier

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.850
until our old friend gravity takes over and
pulls the condensed droplets to the ground

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.370
in the form of rain or in the form of snow
or hail or sleet or graupel.

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:06.880
So now the water's on the ground,

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.920
but gravity continues to work on it pulling it towards its resting place wherever that might be.

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.500
It either pulls the water across the surface of the land to the lowest point in a process called runoff,

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:16.940
or it pulls it underground.

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.500
Water can be trapped or stored for a little
while in places like lakes and ponds and wetlands,

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.130
but most of the water that falls as precipitation
gets pulled lower and lower and lower

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.470
as runoff through the creeks and streams and
rivers until it reaches the ocean.

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:34.830
In really cold places, water of course freezes and hangs around as ice in places for thousands of years at a time,

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:40.660
like at the poles and glaciers and on mountaintops, but when it melts, most of it too runs off into the ocean.

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.380
So you see where this is going.

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.790
Oceans are a big deal -- they're pretty much
the biggest deal.

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.400
They're the reason that we have the hydrologic
cycle in the first place.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.030
They're also the reason that we have awesome
stuff like weather, and life, on Earth.

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.330
The weird thing about oceans though is that
they're salty.

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:54.800
And there is a reason for this!

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:59.820
As water runs to the ocean it erodes minerals like salt from soil and carries it to the ocean.

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.180
Now water heading to the ocean may not taste
salty but the salt's in there.

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:08.110
But here's the thing: when the water evaporates again, the salt doesn't evaporate with it, it gets left behind.

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.470
You keep this up for a few billion years with
the pure water evaporating from the ocean

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:16.380
and returning with tiny amounts of salt and that's your recipe for a billion cubic kilometers of brine.

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.960
And all of this shows us that the world's oceans are literally the last stop for all the liquid water on Earth.

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:25.370
The only way to get out of there is through
evaporation and that leaves all your minerals behind.

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.770
Now living things also have their role to
play in the hydrologic cycle,

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:33.620
and both plants and animals that break down carbohydrates to produce energy produces water as a waste product.

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:38.800
So we lose water through evaporation from our skin and exhale water vapor and of course we pee it out.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.580
Indeed most organisms on Earth are made mostly
of water,

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.790
although that water cycles in and out of us
pretty quickly.

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:46.830
In plants, water is sucked up through the
roots and moves up to the leaves

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.840
(the gas exchange organs) where it evaporates
quickly.

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.300
This process is called evapotranspiration. And since there are so many plants here on Earth

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:57.380
it's responsible for a good amount of the
water that enters the atmosphere.

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:01.980
This process is essentially the opposite of condensation in that it turns liquid water into gas.

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:06.460
The energy of the sun drives evaporation whether it's the surface of the ocean or from treetops and leaves,

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:11.060
and then once all of that water evaporates into the atmosphere we're right back where we started.

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:12.060
It's a cycle!

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.020
So now that you know a little bit about the
hydrologic cycle,

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:17.450
it's a little easier to understand how the
carbon cycle works.

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:22.260
Carbon is one of the most abundant elements in the universe and here on Earth it's always on the move,

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.240
just like water, jumping from one reservoir
to the next.

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:26.919
And that's a good thing because

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:31.080
A) all living things require carbon for their
structure and to fuel their bodies

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.900
and B) it's a big component in a bunch of
non-living things as well.

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.260
It's in rocks, in the ocean, trapped in ice.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:41.010
Plus, it's in the atmosphere, where it helps
regulate the temperature.

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:43.639
Without carbon dioxide Earth would basically
be a frozen wasteland,

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:47.210
so lucky for us, there's a whole pants-load
of carbon out there, 'cause we need it!

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:48.980
Let's start off with the carbon in living
things.

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:51.570
If you were to take all of the water out of
your body,

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:56.060
carbon would constitute about half of what remained in the little pile of dust that used to be you.

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:58.740
And the first biological carbon reservoir
is plants.

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:02.760
They absorb a bunch of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere because they need it to photosynthesize.

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:07.699
But CO2 is also one of the by-products of respiration, the process by which they use that energy.

00:06:07.699 --> 00:06:10.910
So plants take in carbon dioxide from the
atmosphere during photosynthesis

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:16.370
and then release CO2 back out into the atmosphere
during their respiration process to make ATP

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:17.840
for all their cellular functions.

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:19.220
And right now, you're like,

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:22.630
"Wait-wait-wait-no isn't it the deal that
plants get to take in all the carbon dioxide

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:24.570
and animals get to breathe it out?"

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:28.470
Well, yes and no; it's just that plants take
in more CO2 from the atmosphere than they

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:30.260
give off though respiration.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.960
The rest is like their profit; it's what becomes
the body of the plant.

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:39.520
That's right, that big-ol' massive tree, all
that mass, came from gas. Pretty cool.

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:41.940
So carbon absorbed by plants has three possible
fates.

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:45.820
It can be respired back into the atmosphere,
it can be eaten by an animal,

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:48.110
or it can be present when the plant dies.

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:49.919
And if a tree falls in the right kind of forest,

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:53.840
and it's not allowed to decompose normally because a bunch of other plants all fell right on top of it,

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:57.820
and they die and they get buried and squished
together and form rocks like coal.

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:01.140
We call these carbon-rich geological deposits
fossil fuels.

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:04.900
Lately one of humanity's very favorite pastimes
is digging up all of this carbon

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:09.449
in the form of carbon and natural gas, and
burning it to fuel our, pretty much everythings.

00:07:09.449 --> 00:07:11.630
But I'll get to that later.

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:14.530
Another extremely important carbon reservoir
is the ocean.

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:16.880
Now carbon dioxide dissolves really easily
in water,

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:19.180
and once it's in there all of it's used by
phytoplankton

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:22.139
(tiny plant-like organisms that form the base
for the marine food chain).

00:07:22.139 --> 00:07:26.720
They use it to do photosynthesis and they
also use it to form calcium carbonate shells.

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:30.710
And when these guys die, their shells settle
to the bottom of the ocean, pile up,

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:34.060
become compressed and over time, make rocks
like limestone.

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:37.870
Now limestone, obviously doesn't burn super
well, so it's not considered a fossil fuel,

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:42.840
but as limestone deposits are eroded by water, the calcium carbonate is broken down to eventually form,

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:45.789
among other things, carbon dioxide and carbonic
acid.

00:07:45.789 --> 00:07:50.409
We make lime and cement by heating limestone, which produces a pretty good amount of carbon dioxide.

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:54.150
And when we do burn fossil fuels such as coal
and petroleum products and natural gases

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:58.039
it also releases carbon in the form of carbon
dioxide that's been stored for hundreds of

00:07:58.039 --> 00:08:00.179
millions of years in the geosphere,

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:02.780
which is just a fancy science-y word for Earth-rocks.

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:08.020
This process is what started the atmosphere carbon dioxide rising like crazy in the past couple of hundred years.

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:11.610
And the excess of the carbon in the atmosphere
causes global climate change,

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:16.200
because CO2 in the atmosphere causes some of the sun's energy from re-radiating back out into space.

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:20.100
So yeah, our planet has been getting warmer
because we've been burning through this reservoir

00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:21.759
of carbon that we had locked underground.

00:08:21.759 --> 00:08:24.320
This is causing all kinds of problems that
we can see already,

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:27.380
and it's very likely to keep causing bigger
and bigger problems with time.

00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:31.110
And the situation could be helped a lot if
we could just stop unlocking all of that carbon

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:32.719
and spitting it into the atmosphere,

00:08:32.719 --> 00:08:36.499
but in some respects we don't even have control
over the situation any more, because of ice.

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:38.999
Remember how I said that carbon is often trapped
in ice?

00:08:38.999 --> 00:08:44.099
Well, in places like Siberia, and northern Canada and Alaska, cold places that also have plants,

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:49.880
they contain huge carbon reserves that are trapped in permafrost (ground that's frozen year-round).

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:54.400
These places are basically frozen wetlands that add another layer of dead plant matter each year.

00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:57.389
But as permafrost melts, these dead plants
decompose,

00:08:57.389 --> 00:09:01.009
and huge amounts of carbon dioxide and methane
are released into the atmosphere,

00:09:01.009 --> 00:09:02.579
creating a positive feedback loop.

00:09:02.579 --> 00:09:06.110
Our carbon burning lifestyle is releasing
this other huge carbon reservoir,

00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:10.069
which keep the whole greenhouse effect going
with or without us. Just sayin'

00:09:10.069 --> 00:09:12.009
Sorry to end on such a frightening and depressing
note,

00:09:12.009 --> 00:09:15.689
but the stability of the global climate is
not as stable as we would like it to be,

00:09:15.689 --> 00:09:18.480
and the fact that we're throwing it out of
whack is one of the most important reasons

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:20.569
to study ecology in the first place.

00:09:20.569 --> 00:09:24.980
