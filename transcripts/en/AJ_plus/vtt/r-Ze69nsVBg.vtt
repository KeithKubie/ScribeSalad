00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.880
Is the Democrats' taboo on calling out Israel finally breaking?

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:09.380
For decades, Democratic Party leaders have embraced Israel as an ally that could do no wrong,

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:14.180
and have marched in lockstep with Washington DC 's Israel lobby, AIPAC.

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:14.840
But

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.880
is the Democrats' love affair with Israel coming to an end?

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.220
For many years,

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.580
even Democrats who were privately critical of Israeli policies

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.960
deemed it too politically risky to make those views public.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:26.720
But then,

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.240
in 2016,

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:28.860
this happened:

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:32.140
If we are ever going to bring peace...

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.480
we are gonna have to treat the Palestinian people

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.420
with respect and dignity.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.020
The fact that an American presidential candidate

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.860
— who also happened to be Jewish —

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.820
demanded on national TV that Palestinians be treated with respect and dignity,

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.400
and then received an applause was extraordinary to witness.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.360
It meant a lot, for a lot of reasons, actually.

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.980
Bernie Sanders was interesting not only because

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.140
he was one of the few

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.580
major Democratic candidates for president who was critical of Israeli policy,

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:11.420
but the interesting thing is that he actually found that

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.160
people liked what he said.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.960
Bernie's statement about Palestinian rights broke the U.S. political convention

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.220
of discussing Palestinians only through the lens of Israel and Israeli security.

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.340
It's true that most Americans do care about Israel's security.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.440
I think they don't buy the argument that this is what's going on here.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.600
Because they see the occupation that's been there

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.940
since 1967 unending.

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.420
They know a lot of the humiliation that takes place

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.440
is totally unrelated to security.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.080
So I think in the end,

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.160
people see this not so much as an anti-Israel stand,

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.840
they see it as a global human rights, international law

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.360
democracy stand.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.440
But Bernie's statement didn't come out of nowhere.

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:56.560
Believe it or not

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.880
Barack Obama gets some credit for acknowledging the Palestinian struggle.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.660
In 2009,

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.340
he spoke about the hardships that Palestinians face:

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:05.500
the displacement,

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.340
the oppression,

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:07.440
the pain

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:08.520
and the humiliation.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.660
Many wait in refugee camps in the West Bank,

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:12.400
Gaza

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.020
in neighboring lands for a life of peace and security

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.340
that they have never been able to lead.

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.500
They endure the daily humiliations

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:22.260
large and small,

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.200
that come with occupation.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.680
He also directly linked the Palestinian plight with Israel's creation.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.360
It is also undeniable that the Palestinian people have suffered

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.660
in pursuit of a homeland.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.320
For more than 60 years,

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.640
they've endured the pain of dislocation.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.660
Obama's speech was seen as sympathetic to Palestinians.

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.760
And according to the New York Times,

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.220
it upset some Israelis

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.120
and American supporters of Israel because

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.100
"they saw the speech as elevating the Palestinians to equal status."

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.060
But it's years of advocacy work by progressive groups have helped push

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.880
the narrative of Palestinian rights to be included in the Israel-Palestine debate.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.680
And intersectionality has played a vital role in this.

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.140
Black activists,

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.580
media personalities

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.600
and members of the Black Lives Matter movement

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:13.140
have shown up for the Palestinians, calling for an end to the Israeli occupation.

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.860
I think there's been a huge increase in actually just seeing the connections between

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.440
struggle between people of color in the U.S.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.860
and poor people, and people of color all around the world.

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.420
We came here to Palestine to stand in love and revolutionary struggle

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:28.760
with our brothers and sisters.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.360
When I went to Palestine, obviously I saw many, many connections

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.880
between what was happening to Palestinian people

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.700
and what's happening to Black people in the U.S.

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.060
Looking at a place like Gaza in particular,

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.760
like many of the horribly oppressive practices

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.600
are then shipped and used.

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.100
Police departments in the U.S. and here in Florida,

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.280
and the Miami police department

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.720
have gone to get trained by the IDF

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:51.240
several times.

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.540
And so we're seeing an evolution of our policing system

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.760
that actually really mirrors what has happened in Palestine.

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:58.860
And Palestinians,

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.320
both in the occupied territories and abroad,

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.800
have in return vocalized support for Black civil rights.

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.160
You know, Ferguson protesters who were protesting the murder of

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.120
Michael Brown,

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.700
when they were met with this huge attack from the

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.580
Ferguson Police Department and the spraying of tear gas...

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:20.160
I think it was like Palestinian activist Mariam Barghouti

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.300
who was actually like, here's how you protect yourself from the tear gas.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.960
In 2015,

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.440
the Black-Palestinian Solidarity campaign released a video

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.740
that showed the similar challenges facing both communities.

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.140
Capitalism,

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:33.340
white supremacy,

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:34.560
Zionism,

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:35.540
imperialism -

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:41.000
all of these systems actually thrive when we're isolated from one another.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.500
So,

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.000
when I don't see my struggle as connected to other people,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.560
I internalize those systems and think, oh my problems are my problems

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.820
my community's problems are my community's problems.

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:55.460
But when we're actually able to draw connections,

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:57.300
it really reveals that no,

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.000
there are larger systems.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.020
These are not my problems,

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:01.900
these are not my community's problems.

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:03.980
This is actually oppression.

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:08.360
I think solidarity on a fundamental level actually allows us to see the broader system

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:09.820
that we're fighting against.

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:12.760
We might not be experiencing the exact same struggles,

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.540
but we're definitely up against the same oppressor.

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:18.500
And there's also been more American progressive Jews

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.620
who see Israel's oppression of Palestinians

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.140
as contradictory to Jewish values.

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:25.420
It's no longer the case that

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:26.860
Jewish communities can expect

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.160
young Jews and a future generation [of Jews] to be in lockstep

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.640
and refuse to critique Israeli policy

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.860
and refuse to stand for Palestinian freedom.

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:36.060
In fact,

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.240
a report by the Anti-Defamation League

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.000
and an Israeli think tank

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
identified intersectionality

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.640
as "an emerging challenge"

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.100
to the "pro-Israel network."

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:48.300
After I went to Palestine and we came back, we were working on

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.960
a policy platform for the movement for Black Lives

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:52.120
and it was like,

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.160
how can we not include the struggles of

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.980
what's happening to Palestinian people?

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:58.560
We got a lot of backlash for that choice,

00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:59.860
which I think is again,

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:04.320
a sign of how scared they are of the potential of solidarity,

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:08.020
how scared they are to lose bases of support in the U.S.

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:12.300
Viewing the issue as a matter of equality and human rights for Palestinians

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:15.300
is increasingly popular among the new wave of

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:17.040
Democrats that have entered Congress.

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:18.820
We have now,

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:22.380
for the first time, these elected officials in DC who are willing

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:26.060
to say the hard truth even though it comes at a great risk to them.

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:30.680
One of the most important ways that these new elected officials are challenging

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:34.660
the Democratic establishment's traditional stance with Israel is that

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:36.440
they're refusing to play by their rules,

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:37.260
right?

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:39.020
They're supporting BDS,

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:40.900
the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement.

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:43.720
They're supporting Palestinian human rights.

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:45.880
and they're calling out groups like AIPAC.

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:49.260
That also reflects the trend among Democratic Party voters.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:53.240
A 2018 study showed that self-identified liberal Democrats

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:56.440
are more likely to side with Palestinians than Israelis,

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:59.220
compared to moderate and conservative Democrats,

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:01.000
who generally still side with Israel.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.080
You know, I think for far too long

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:06.280
Palestinians have really been dehumanized

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:07.460
in the American discourse.

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:09.560
And in the past number of years,

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:11.700
the realities and the root causes

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:15.400
of Palestinian dispossession are coming to light.

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:18.740
And this shift away from unwavering support of Israel

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:21.180
might be worrying establishment Democrats.

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:24.620
If the Democratic establishment is not worried,

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:25.560
they should be.

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:29.300
Because the polls show the rapid increase of young Americans

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:32.060
critical of Israel and in support of Palestinian human rights -

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:33.460
both Jewish and not Jewish.

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:35.720
A few prominent and veteran Democrats

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:39.880
have actually started a new group with the aim of supporting candidates in 2020

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:41.280
who are vocally pro-Israel.

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:44.340
In fact, the group's president told the New York Times that

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:47.300
"There are a few discordant voices, but we want to make sure

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:51.360
that what's a very small problem doesn't metastasize into a bigger problem."

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:55.460
Polls show a long-term trend that counts against the establishment:

00:07:55.460 --> 00:08:00.440
Support and sympathy for Israel is declining among younger voters and people of color.

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:03.980
One survey showed that younger Americans were less likely

00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:05.140
to see Israel as an "ally,"

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:06.680
and the same goes for women

00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:07.580
and Black

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:08.780
and Hispanic Americans.

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:10.360
And yes,

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:12.920
the divide between Democrats and Republicans on Israel

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.200
is also widening.

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:15.480
In fact,

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:17.020
the partisan divide on that issue

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:20.780
is now wider than at any point since 1978.

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:24.640
Republican support for Israel is also fueled by

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:25.640
the Christian right.

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:27.780
According to a Pew Research survey,

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:31.980
self-identified Republicans sympathizing more with Israel than Palestinians

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:34.180
has incresed from 50%

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:36.460
to 79% since 2001.

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:38.460
Over the same period,

00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:40.200
Democrats sympathizing for Israel

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:43.960
declined from 38% to 27%.

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:48.240
The Democratic base is demanding that kind of integrity from their politicians

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:50.380
and they know that there's no way to talk about human rights,

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:50.980
or

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:53.380
talk about racial justice,

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:56.920
if you are silent about the issue of justice for Palestinians.

00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:59.680
And so, the Democratic base is changing

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:03.760
and are electing people and demanding that their elected officials

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:05.180
reflect their values.

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:09.100
The shifting gratitudes in the Democratic Party towards Israel

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:12.680
means that there's someone else that's probably getting a bit uneasy.

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:13.920
AIPAC.

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:16.680
According to Center for Responsive Politics,

00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:20.700
AIPAC spent $3.5 million in 2018 on lobbying,

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:24.160
essentially helping maintain a pro-Israel Congress.

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:26.000
Clearly they are influential.

00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:30.660
Now, has this disruptive change that has taken place

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:33.320
in the rules of the game affect them?

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:34.360
Of course it has.

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:37.240
Some Democrats remain very much in Israel's corner.

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:40.520
They speak in support of Israel and attend AIPAC conferences.

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:41.200
Oh,

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:43.500
and occasionally say things like this:

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:45.160
The view of Palestinians

00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:47.100
is simple.

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:47.600
"Well,

00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:50.300
the Europeans treated the Jews badly,

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:51.780
culminating in the Holocaust,

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.300
and they gave them our land as compensation."

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:57.220
Of course we say it's our land

00:09:57.460 --> 00:09:58.660
the Torah says it.

00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:00.860
But they don't believe in the Torah.

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:02.120
So,

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:05.240
that's the reason there is not peace.

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:08.680
But as the Democratic Party attempts to put on a united front

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:10.300
when it comes to the subject of Israel,

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:13.520
it wouldn't be wrong to say that even within the establishment,

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:16.500
there are undercurrents of discontentment with Israel.

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:19.040
And Netanyahu plays a big role in that.

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:23.160
A lot of Democrats have also witnessed that this Israeli government,

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.300
the current Israeli government, has been led

00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:29.780
by Prime Minister Netanyahu who most Democrats

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:30.920
don't like,

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:34.640
not only because they don't like the values that he projects

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:38.240
and the policies that he undertakes on Israel-Palestine,

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:42.880
but also because they see him as taking a position in American politics

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:45.380
much more sympathetic to the Republican Party.

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:46.400
Back in 2015,

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:50.020
he annoyed Democrats by going over the administration's head

00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:51.760
to appeal directly to Congress

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:54.880
to oppose President Obama over the Iran nuclear deal.

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:59.020
And Israel's killing of Palestinian protesters along the fence in Gaza

00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:00.800
also attracted criticism.

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:04.660
With the party's progressive wing demanding that the Democrats

00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:06.700
end their silence on Palestinian human rights

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:08.800
but the establishment dragging its heels...

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:11.620
what does that mean for the Democratic Party?

00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:13.060
For whatever reason,

00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:15.340
a lot of young Democrats have latched

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:21.840
onto this issue as kind of a litmus test for whether or not a Democratic candidate

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.320
is genuinely in harmony with the on their values, and it's likely

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:31.320
to put a lot of pressure on political candidates as we move forward.
