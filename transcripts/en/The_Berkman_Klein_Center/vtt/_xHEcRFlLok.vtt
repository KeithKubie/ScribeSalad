00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.730
 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.020
This is the third and
last segment of a lecture

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.350
on the Welfare Theory of Copyright.

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:24.580
In the first segment, I discussed
the so-called public goods problem;

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:29.100
the kinds of circumstances that either
exacerbate or mitigate that problem;

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.960
and the five ways in which governments
have, over the past several centuries,

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.850
attempted to overcome that problem.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.570
One of those five mechanisms,
as we saw, consists

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.840
of the creation and enforcement
of intellectual property rights,

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.680
including copyrights.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.920
In the second segment of the lecture, I
used a stylized version of a real case

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.250
study, involving sales of
copies of a documentary film

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.450
to examine in some detail how the
copyright system does, or might,

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.370
advance the goals of the welfare theory.

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.210
In this third and last segment of
the lecture, I'll do two things.

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.190
First, I will explore a few of the
many applications and refinements

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.320
of the welfare theory that
economists and legal scholars

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.650
have developed recently.

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.440
And second, I will offer a preliminary
survey of the strengths and weaknesses

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.986
of copyright assessed from the
standpoint of utilitarianism.

00:01:24.986 --> 00:01:28.290
 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.930
The first and most general
application of this theory

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.010
begins with the observation that
from a utilitarian standpoint,

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:41.390
copyright is not an unalloyed good
but is rather a necessary evil.

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.070
Social welfare is advanced
when ideas flow freely

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:51.330
and when producers compete to satisfy
consumers' desires efficiently.

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.320
Copyright impedes both of those ends.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.940
The reason that, nevertheless,
the copyright system

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.970
is in the aggregate
of socially beneficial

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.010
is that it is necessary--
so the argument goes--

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.380
to stimulate the creation
of intellectual products

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.770
from which we all benefit.

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.360
Notice that this orientation
differs very sharply

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.710
from the way in which copyright is
seen through the lenses of the fairness

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:21.140
theory, or the personality theory--
both considered in lecture number two.

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:26.560
Viewed through those glasses, copyright
deserves our unqualified support,

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.170
because copyright law
tracks and enforces

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:35.570
the natural rights, or the fundamental
human needs, of artists and authors.

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:41.440
The support provided to copyright by
the welfare theory is more grudging.

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.800
The conception of copyright
as a necessary evil

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.520
has a crucial practical implication.

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:51.520
Copyrights should not be used in
context in which they're not necessary.

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.680
In particular, copyright
protection should not

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.180
be extended to kinds of innovations that
would be produced in optimal numbers

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.680
without those protections.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.180
So what kinds of innovations
might fall into this category?

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.660
I mentioned a few in the
first segment of the lecture,

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:13.200
when discussing circumstances that
can mitigate the public goods problem.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.200
Perhaps the most obvious
candidate, already mentioned,

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.180
would be advertisements.

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.950
You will recall, I hope, Justice
Harlan's dissent in the 1903 Bleistein

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.820
case in which he contended
that advertisements should not

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.280
enjoy copyright protection.

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.700
A welfare theorist
might agree with Harlan,

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.440
not on the grounds that ads are not
art, but on the ground that companies

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:41.350
have lots of other incentives to
produce and disseminate advertisements.

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.900
So if you eliminated
copyright protection for ads,

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:50.490
you would not likely see any
diminution in their output.

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:53.970
Much the same could be said for
scholarly articles, also mentioned

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.810
in the first segment.

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.330
Arguably, these are already produced in
numbers that exceed the social optimum.

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:05.240
But putting that source of unease to one
side, the various non-pecuniary motives

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:10.540
that drive scholars-- such as tenure,
reputation, fame, altruism, insecurity,

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.460
boredom, and so forth-- are more
than adequate to incentivize

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:19.120
the creation of those
articles-- a possible objection.

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.440
Well, maybe so, but social welfare
requires more than inducing scholars

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.120
to write articles.

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:29.060
It also requires the establishment of
adequate incentives to publish them.

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.350
Copyright protection may not
be necessary for the authors,

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:36.700
but it is necessary for the publishers.

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.430
This is a very important
refinement of the welfare theory.

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.720
Indeed nowadays, economists, who write
in this vein, tend to be as or more

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.740
concerned with creating optimal
incentives for the commercialization

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:52.130
of innovations as they are with creating
optimal incentives for generating

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:55.010
those innovations.

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:57.830
However, arguably,
this legitimate concern

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:02.000
has little grip in the context
of scholarly articles, at least

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.900
nowadays, when the cost of publishing
them has, courtesy of the internet,

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.950
dropped so low.

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:13.870
So here's the general guideline
suggested by these two examples.

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:16.090
If you find the welfare
theory congenial,

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:20.810
you should be watchful as we proceed
through this course for circumstances

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:24.970
in which copyright entitlements
are not necessary to stimulate

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:29.370
creative activities or the
commercialization of their products.

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.180
In such circumstances,
the policy argument

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:35.270
for the elimination of the
entitlements at issue is strong.

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:38.160
 

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.480
Here's the second implication
of the welfare theory.

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:43.990
You'll recall, I hope, that
in the previous lecture,

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:47.640
I discussed the disaggregation
of the copyright system--

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:51.330
the ways in which the rules applicable
to specific types of innovations

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:53.030
differ.

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:58.420
The welfare theory offers potential
justification for this disaggregation.

00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:59.380
Why?

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:02.880
Because as we've seen, the severity
of the public goods problem

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.420
varies by type of work.

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:09.590
In addition, the best way of offsetting
the hazard of under production

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:11.820
varies by type of work.

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:14.300
Thus, the scope of the
set of entitlements

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:19.360
enjoyed by different
creators should differ.

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.100
Here's an example, duration.

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:26.310
Currently, both patents and copyrights
last for the same period of time,

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:29.260
regardless of the type of
work they're applied to.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.560
Patents last for 20 years from the
date of the patent application,

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.970
while-- at least in the United
States-- most copyrights

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:38.080
last for the life of the
author plus 70 years.

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:43.530
Those terms don't change when
the type of work changes.

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:48.150
Arguably, from the standpoint
of welfare theory, they should.

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:51.750
To be sure, there are
welfare-based counter arguments

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:54.680
for the impulse toward disaggregation.

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:58.090
Most importantly, subdividing
the universe of copyrighted works

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:03.010
into even more distinct varieties,
each subject to even more customized

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:08.190
sets of rules, would increase
administrative and litigation costs.

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:12.060
Equally serious, that the risk that
the lobbying power of companies

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:16.550
that stood to gain by tweaking the
increasingly specialized sets of rules

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:20.290
would grow, which would be good for
those companies but bad for the public

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:22.710
at large.

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:25.220
These competing
considerations are nicely

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:28.810
explored by professors,
Mark Lemley and Dan Burke.

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:31.370
 

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:34.060
A third application
of the welfare theory

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:38.740
consists of a guideline for
comparing the relative desirability

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:42.860
of the various rights that we
might give to copyright owners.

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:47.650
Specifically, it suggests that when
choosing among possible rights,

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:52.480
we should attend carefully to the
ratio between the incentives generated

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:58.190
by each entitlement and the social
welfare losses that come with it.

00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:00.010
Other things being
equal, we should strive

00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:01.860
to give copyright
owners entitlements that

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:05.830
have large incentive-to-loss
ratios and deny them

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:09.410
entitlements that have low ratios.

00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:10.880
Here's an example.

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:15.510
Should we permit copyright owners
to prevent quotation of excerpts

00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:19.170
from their works in critical reviews?

00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:23.770
Viewed from the standpoint of welfare
theory, the answer is probably no.

00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:24.390
Why?

00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:28.300
Because on one hand, giving
copyright owners this power

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:31.810
would not enhance their revenue, much.

00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:35.590
On the other hand, it would lead
to large social welfare losses

00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:39.510
by reducing the informational
value of critical reviews,

00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:42.250
thereby diminishing the
ability of customers

00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:45.620
to decide whether they want
to go see a particular movie,

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:48.820
to read a particular book, and so forth.

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:52.450
In sum, the incentive-to-loss
ratio associated

00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:56.500
with this particular
potential entitlement is low.

00:08:56.500 --> 00:09:00.420
Therefore, if we are faithful to
the welfare theory of copyright,

00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:03.910
we should deny this right
to copyright owners.

00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:08.130
And in fact, most jurisdictions
do deny it to copyright owners

00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:14.440
by creating an exception or limitation
on copyright for critical reviews.

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:17.760
 

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:21.340
As you can see from the map, there
are many more potentially illuminating

00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:24.170
applications of welfare theory.

00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:26.350
Some of them, I'll take
up in subsequent lectures.

00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:29.110
 

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:32.110
So now, armed with these various
applications and insights, let's

00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:34.770
return to a general
question I implicitly

00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:39.250
left open in the first
segment of this lecture.

00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:44.820
Copyright law, I argued, is only one of
five possible ways in which governments

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:48.130
could and do seek to offset
the risk that public goods will

00:09:48.130 --> 00:09:50.040
be under-produced.

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:51.510
Is it the best?

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:56.100
Or somewhat more subtly, what are
the advantages and disadvantages

00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:58.455
of copyright compared to
the other four strategies?

00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:04.467
One of the motivations for
undertaking this survey

00:10:04.467 --> 00:10:06.800
is that it's far from obvious
that copyright will always

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:11.330
be the best way of stimulating
every type of intellectual product.

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:14.090
As sectors of art and
business evolve, it's

00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:17.090
possible that one of the
other four strategies

00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:19.740
may surpass it in relative
social desirability.

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:22.540
 

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:27.010
So the map sets forth
an initial catalog.

00:10:27.010 --> 00:10:30.400
As a mechanism for inducing
socially beneficial creativity,

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:33.510
copyright has four main advantages.

00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:37.150
First, it relies upon the
market to drive innovation

00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:40.010
toward areas of high social value.

00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:42.252
Potential creators,
knowing that their revenues

00:10:42.252 --> 00:10:43.960
will be increased by
the number of people

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:47.710
who will purchase their products,
direct their creative energies

00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:51.380
towards zones where there are
lots of potential customers.

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:56.820
And that, usually, corresponds
roughly to high social value.

00:10:56.820 --> 00:10:58.410
Now, not always.

00:10:58.410 --> 00:11:01.170
Research on new drugs,
which tends to focus

00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:03.960
on ailments that afflict the
rich and neglects ailments that

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:08.285
afflict the poor, is perhaps the
sharpest counterexample, but roughly.

00:11:08.285 --> 00:11:11.160
 

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:14.870
Second, the copyright system does not
rely upon government administrators

00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:18.560
to determine the best paths
for research and innovation.

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:22.610
Instead, it places control in the
hands of private parties, who typically

00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:25.650
have better knowledge than
the government administrators

00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:29.230
concerning the costs and benefits
of alternative potential lines

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:34.440
of research, writing,
artistry, and so forth.

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:38.150
Third, the copyright system,
like the patent system,

00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:42.870
has the social welfare advantage of
imposing the costs of innovations

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:46.220
upon the users of those innovations.

00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:50.430
The practice of recouping costs
through monopoly pricing--

00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:53.060
that we've explored in
detail in this lecture--

00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:56.000
has a commendable ancillary benefit.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.980
The people who benefit
from a film or drug

00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:02.400
pay not just the marginal
costs of reproducing it

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:06.920
but a share of the cost of
creating it in the first instance.

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:12.790
Not only does that seem fair, it avoids
the kinds of slippage and inefficiency

00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:17.185
that result from misalignment
of payers and beneficiaries.

00:12:17.185 --> 00:12:20.480
 

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:25.710
Fourth and finally, copyright, and
intellectual property in general,

00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:30.560
tends to foster fast, focused
research and innovation.

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:31.160
Why?

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:35.070
Because innovators know that only if
they reach the finish line first--

00:12:35.070 --> 00:12:38.660
produce the film, create
and test the new drug-- can

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:42.610
they recover their costs of expression
by securing and then exercising--

00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:45.730
as we've seen-- market power.

00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:49.520
In this respect, copyrights
and patents contrast sharply

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:53.980
with government grants as a
mechanism for stimulating innovation.

00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:58.310
Grants are less likely to generate
the same aggressive, fast,

00:12:58.310 --> 00:13:00.650
focused innovative activity.

00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:05.240
Because the government grantees,
once they have the money in hand,

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:06.840
have no special incentive to hurry.

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:10.120
 

00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:14.460
So those are the four primary advantages
from the utilitarian standpoint

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:16.320
of the copyright system.

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:18.170
They are substantial.

00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:22.090
Historically, they've been widely
thought to be decisive with respect

00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:27.660
to alternative ways of generating
most forms of art and literature.

00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:31.140
There are, however, some
disadvantages to intellectual property

00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:33.550
as a response to the
public goods problem.

00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:38.740
And in some contexts, those
disadvantages may be increasing.

00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:42.000
The first, we've already
discussed in some detail.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.280
The pricing practices
enabled by copyright

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:51.210
usually give rise to socially
pernicious dead weight losses.

00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:54.180
To review, when the prices
of films or drugs rise,

00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:56.230
some people cannot afford them.

00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:59.010
At a minimum, that's a cause for regret.

00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:03.290
In some contexts, it can be tragic.

00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:07.780
Next, copyright and patent systems have
administrative and litigation costs.

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:11.640
Significant resources are
devoted to lawyers and courts

00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:15.130
necessary to interpret and
enforce authors' rights.

00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:19.470
From the standpoint of social
welfare, that's a waste.

00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:22.700
Third, copyright and
patent systems sometimes

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:26.610
create impediments to
cumulative innovation.

00:14:26.610 --> 00:14:29.110
That phrase refers to
the common phenomenon

00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:33.920
in which one innovator builds
on the work of another.

00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:37.910
It's not inevitable that copyrights
gum up cumulative innovation.

00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:41.700
As we saw in lecture number three,
licensing systems, for example,

00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:44.510
of the sort that are
well-developed in the film industry

00:14:44.510 --> 00:14:48.580
can enable, even catalyze,
sequential innovation.

00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:51.390
But licensing systems work
well, in this respect,

00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:55.760
only when they can rely upon
comprehensive registration

00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:58.330
of intellectual property rights.

00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:02.110
If you can't ascertain who owns
the rights to a particular work,

00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:05.330
you can't get a license
to build upon it.

00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:08.580
Copyright-- as we'll see
in lecture number six--

00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:11.690
is notoriously bad from
this standpoint, because it

00:15:11.690 --> 00:15:13.990
has no comprehensive
registration system.

00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:17.180
 

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:21.960
The fourth disadvantage is known
by economists as rent dissipation.

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:23.290
What does that mean?

00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:26.610
It's shorthand for the unfortunate
tendency of intellectual property

00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:31.860
rights, both patents and copyrights,
to draw excessive numbers of people

00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:36.320
into the competition for generating
a socially beneficial innovation.

00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:38.520
Sensitivity to this
effect has recently been

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:42.105
heightened by the work of Chris
Yu and Michael Abromovitz.

00:15:42.105 --> 00:15:44.720
 

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:50.035
Last but not least, as we saw in the
final phase of the CDF case study,

00:15:50.035 --> 00:15:53.140
the copyright system works
optimally as an incentive

00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:57.350
for creativity only when there are
reasonably effective mechanisms

00:15:57.350 --> 00:16:00.820
for enforcing the copyrights.

00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:02.840
As undoubtedly you're
well aware, the mechanisms

00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:06.150
for enforcing copyrights with respect
to digital recordings of entertainment

00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:09.430
products are deteriorating.

00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:13.860
Consequently, the frequency of
non-permissive, presumptively unlawful

00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:17.945
redistribution of those
recordings keeps going up.

00:16:17.945 --> 00:16:23.320
And the business models that depended
upon the suppression of that behavior

00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:25.551
are crumbling.

00:16:25.551 --> 00:16:27.300
There are many possible
ways of responding

00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:29.840
to this crisis in the
entertainment industry.

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:34.450
Some of them involve reinforcing
the failing enforcement mechanisms.

00:16:34.450 --> 00:16:40.160
But if that proves unfeasible, or to
have excessive negative side effects,

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:44.365
we may have to consider one of the
other four possible ways of ensuring

00:16:44.365 --> 00:16:51.740
that the music and film we so much
value continue to be produced.

00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:53.452
Thank you.
