00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now things will become even more complicated.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I'm going to give you a list of numbers

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
slightly different than the one from before--

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
those are actually floating numbers. They have a decimal point.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And I want you to implement the function variance.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
It takes our data and returns a single number,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
which is the variance of the data.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
So for the data set I will be giving you,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
it so turns out that the variance is 62.572.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Now some hints.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
First you're going to use the function mean,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
that you have already programmed, so it's in your code. Just use it.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And then the trick that I want to play is:

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
We have our list here inside the function data.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
We're going to transform this into a new list called "ndata."

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
It is the normalized data, which effectively is the data minus the mean,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
which I'll call "mu."

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
So you compute the mean, called it "mu," perhaps,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and then subtract from the data--from each data item--the mu.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
And this subtraction is not entirely trivial to make the new data set.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
The commands I have been using is

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
I iteratively construct with a for loop the data set.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
First I set it to an empty list.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Then there's this function called "append"--"dot-append,"

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
and whatever's inside the function--you've got to figure this out--

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
will be appended to this list over here.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
So with an initial assignment of an empty list and a for loop,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
we'll go through all the data items

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
and I'll append the appropriate thing to this new data.I get out this new data list.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Then I can apply the same mean function to the new data list,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and that gives me the variance. You got it?

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
If not, listen to the video again.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
So here's the coding environment.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Our data set.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
I've given you the function mean that we've programmed before,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
and now you are to program the function variance.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
So if you print variance of data set,

00:01:35.000 --> 99:59:59.000
you get the desired 62.572884.
