00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.560
- [Jean-Jacques] Today I'd like to present
you with some thoughts about Neanderthal

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:31.380
evolution and to what extent climate might
have influenced their evolution. But

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.280
before I start with the climate and
Neanderthals, I wanted to show you this

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:44.710
slide presenting, on the left side, a
Neanderthal, and a modern human about the

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:53.410
same age. And in front, you have two
skulls of extant apes, a bonobo and a

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:59.500
common chimpanzee. And this is just to
show you how Neanderthals are different

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:05.940
from us in terms of anatomy, in terms
phenotype in general. Modern humans and

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:12.670
Neanderthal's ancestors diverged probably
about half a billion years ago, whereas

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:19.840
bonobos and chimpanzees diverge much
earlier, probably somewhere between two

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:26.870
and one million years ago. And one of the
mysteries regarding Neanderthals is, what

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:35.990
kind of evolutionary process was driving
this very rapid divergence? The way we

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:41.720
like to think of the Neanderthals- the way
they are presented in the literature- is

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:49.200
this way: humans adapted to a glacial
environment, a peri-artic environment. As

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.210
a matter of fact, if we have a look on
this very jerky climactic curve, you're

00:03:54.210 --> 00:04:00.520
going to see quite a few times today I
imagine, you can see that for the last

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:09.330
half million years, 95% of the time the
climate was colder than it is today in the

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:14.380
area where Neanderthals live, mainly
western Eurasia.

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:20.710
This being said, the climate was not
always glacial, the glacial episodes were

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:27.060
rather brief, actually, the most extreme
parts of these glacial episodes. And if

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:33.050
you look on this map, this is a map
showing the distribution of places where

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:39.350
Neanderthals have been found, you see that
actually they are not documented very

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:46.630
highly in latitude. The northernmost
Neanderthal ever found was found 52

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:54.420
degrees of northern latitude, which is not
so high. Neanderthals lived also in places

00:04:54.420 --> 00:05:00.610
like Spain, and southern Italy, or the
Levant, that never really witnessed really

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:08.100
glacial episodes. So the question is what
in their environment, first of all, drove

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:11.420
their distribution, and also drove their
evolution?

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:18.370
The distribution that you see now is, I
would say, misleading somehow because it

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:22.760
is a palimpsest of the distribution of
Neanderthals through a very long period of

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:29.500
time. In other words, at a given point in
the past, they never had this extension,

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:35.400
so it's a sort of addition of many years
of distribution. It is very likely they

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:42.120
reach their easternmost extension in
southern Siberia and southwest Asia only

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:52.360
at some point in their late evolution. So
speaking about climate and the influence

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:59.730
of climate on evolution, we have quite a
number of studies showing how climate can

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:06.380
influence the biology and morphology of
modern humans.

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:17.650
One of the most spectacular features that
relate to climate in extant humans is the

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:26.040
body shape, in general. There are a number
of studies showing that the proportions of

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:32.670
the limbs, the shape of the trunk, varies
with climate. Basically, people exposed to

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:39.670
very hot climates need to cool their
bodies, so they tend to be slimmer, have

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:47.470
narrow trunks, and longer limbs. People
exposed to very cold environments tend to

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:57.470
be huskier, to have shorter limbs, wider
trunks. This kind of study is a

00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:04.884
multi-variant study taking into account
many populations. It shows how you can

00:07:04.884 --> 00:07:12.481
basically rank populations from the
tropics- on the right side you have people

00:07:12.481 --> 00:07:18.455
from East and West Africa- up to the high
altitudes, so in green you have

00:07:18.455 --> 00:07:23.807
European populations.
So if you take measurements of the body

00:07:23.807 --> 00:07:30.266
shape of a Neanderthal and you plot it in
this kind of chart-- this is the case for

00:07:30.266 --> 00:07:37.375
one Neanderthal very known called
[inaudible 00:07:34]. It falls beyond any

00:07:37.375 --> 00:07:46.650
modern European and even beyond modern
Inuits, so it is said to have a

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:52.930
hyper-arctic body proportion.
Interestingly, if you plot on the same

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:59.000
chart early modern humans who came into
Europe about 50,000 years ago to replace

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:05.970
Neanderthals, they plot very close to
populations from modern Sudan- which, by

00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:12.970
the way, it's certainly one of the best
arguments to make that come out of Africa,

00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:22.310
besides genetical arguments. However, we
should be very cautious with these

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:27.350
features, because climactic adaptation is
not just a biological adaptation in

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:34.500
humans, it is also a cultural adaptation,
a technical adaptation. In other words, we

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:41.560
suspect that even if Neanderthals were not
exposed always to very cold climates,

00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:46.440
because of the limitations of their
technology, the biological response might

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:52.680
have been higher than what we have in
extant humans. And as a matter of fact, if

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:57.660
we look at the archeological record, we
find very few archeological sites left by

00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:02.090
Neanderthals in truly very arctic
environments. It looks like during the

00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:09.070
coldest phases of the glacial episodes,
large portions of Europe had been

00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:15.360
abandoned by the Neanderthals. There are
other features that have been said to be

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:19.600
related to climate in Neanderthals,
especially their very peculiar facial

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:28.540
morphology. They have a very strong nasal
facial prominence, this very big nose

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:35.540
projecting, and on the side of the nasal
aperture, inside the face, you have these

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:42.320
volumes which are sinuses, which.are said
to be very developed in Neanderthals in

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:48.080
general. In a sort of naive way, people
have thought for a long time that the

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:55.230
development of sinuses in Neanderthals
were a kind of insulation against cold.

00:09:55.230 --> 00:10:00.900
This idea has been very criticized.
Actually, it's completely abandoned today

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:07.720
because we see more these sinuses as
filling an empty space between other

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:15.270
structures that are adapting to different
functions. It is more interesting to look

00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:22.760
at another aspect of the face, which is
the nose. Actually, if you look at extant

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:29.880
humans, you will see that one of the most
varying parts of the face is the nose and

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:34.570
the shape of the nasal aperture. One of
these skulls comes from Germany, and the

00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:40.350
other one from Zaire in Africa. And
immediately you can see that the shape of

00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:47.200
the nasal aperture is very different in
these two individuals. There is quite a

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:55.910
number of studies showing that actually in
humans, the nose, and especially the inner

00:10:55.910 --> 00:11:03.950
nose, is adapted to the climate conditions
in different regions. Primarily what we

00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:12.980
have is a problem with cold and dry air.
Individual populations that are exposed to

00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:21.890
cold and dry environments tend to have
nasal cavities that are higher and

00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:28.970
narrower, in order to increase the
turbulence of the air that is inspired,

00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:34.930
and to increase the contacts between the
mucus tissues and this air to warm it and

00:11:34.930 --> 00:11:43.180
to moisten it.
The nasal pharynx seems to be more

00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:51.400
depending on moisture, the nasal cavity
itself with cold. So what about

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:56.490
Neanderthals? Well, at first look, the
Neanderthal seems to match very much this

00:11:56.490 --> 00:12:02.930
prediction, because they have this huge
nasal aperture that is somehow unexpected

00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:10.180
if it was exposed to cold environments.
Actually this nasal aperture is especially

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:15.690
broad in its upper part, which is not what
we find in modern tropical populations.

00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:21.760
But if we look inside the nasal aperture,
we see that there are a number of

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:28.880
structures that inflate the walls of the
nasal aperture in order to narrow this

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:38.900
nasal aperture. Although the nasal
aperture is very broad outside, the cavity

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:45.500
inside is much narrower and much more the
prediction we would make about a

00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:52.120
cold-adapted population. Last but not
least we have now, a number of information

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:58.600
coming from paleogenetical studies, and
I'm sure there are a much more to come in

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:03.280
the future. But we know already that there
are a couple of features of Neanderthals

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:09.140
that we can relate to: the climate, the
environment. And I would like at least to

00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:18.740
mention this gene called MC1R which is a
receptor involved in the red hair and fair

00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:25.870
complexions. And very likely, at least on
the Neanderthals on which this gene has

00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:36.730
been detected, we deal with populations
that have light skin color and red hair.

00:13:36.730 --> 00:13:43.550
So we share some adaptations to the cold
environment in Neanderthals, but the

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:48.980
question is are there other effects of the
climate on their evolution? I would like

00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:53.340
now to deal with something else, that I
found probably more important than

00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:59.200
adaptation itself. One of the questions
about Neanderthal evolution is, why do we

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:06.570
have this divergence between an African
lineage leading to us and this Eurasian

00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:11.990
line about half a million years ago? What
happened at this moment? Why then, why not

00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:20.030
before? It raised the question of when
exactly we have the first Neanderthals.

00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:24.470
And the first Neanderthals we have in the
fossil recall are about 400,000 years old.

00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:34.580
They are found in England, they are found
in the UK-- in Spain. And this age, a

00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:41.220
little bit above 400,000, has been for
some time in conflict with dates that were

00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:48.840
provided by geneticists. Geneticists,
using a molecular clock based on

00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:58.280
computations using the assumed time of
divergence of fossil groups, came to much

00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:04.930
earlier younger ages for the divergence of
Neanderthals and modern humans, something

00:15:04.930 --> 00:15:08.980
around 300,000. That was a bit problematic
for paleontologists.

00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:14.620
But recently, because it's now easy to
sequence the complete genomes of parents

00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:21.320
and children, we can compare this genome.
It has been possible to find that the rate

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:26.820
of mutation assumed by this molecular
clock was not quite right.

00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:34.060
And new estimates came with a rate of
mutation much more reduced, [inaudible

00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:39.560
00:15:34] was initially thought. And this
new rate of mutation is confirmed by the

00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:46.590
study of some fossil material- this is a
femur of an early modern human found in

00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:51.800
western Siberia, for which we have the
complete genome. We have the dating, it's

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:57.000
45,000 years old. So it's easy to compare
the genome of this early modern human with

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:03.110
extant Europeans and to have a notion of
the rate of mutation along this lineage.

00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:10.810
It confirms this reduced rate of mutation
that has been recently proposed. So it

00:16:10.810 --> 00:16:15.910
means that the time coalescence time
required for Neanderthals and modern

00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:22.140
humans fits rather well this emergence in
the phenotype, in the morphology, around

00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:29.943
400 or 450,000. What has been going on in
this time period? We have a list of

00:16:29.943 --> 00:16:38.170
features proper to Neanderthals that we
see emerging through time by a process of

00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:46.327
accretion, and it's basically a shift in
frequency of these features that we see

00:16:46.327 --> 00:16:55.813
more and more along time. About 200,000
years ago, in the isotopic stage seven, we

00:16:55.813 --> 00:17:00.684
have basically reached the Neanderthal
morphology completely. So the story

00:17:00.684 --> 00:17:07.326
unfolds between, say, 450-- I'm talking
about morphology here, and a little bit

00:17:07.326 --> 00:17:14.638
less than 200,000. And it goes at
different speed, depending on the

00:17:14.638 --> 00:17:20.955
different anatomical areas, and we suspect
that one of the mechanisms driving this

00:17:20.955 --> 00:17:25.931
evolution is not adaptation, it is not
selection, it is something that

00:17:25.931 --> 00:17:35.356
geneticists call drift. And this drift is
mostly depending on demography. So what is

00:17:35.356 --> 00:17:39.300
it about?
It's simple. You have variability of a

00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:44.810
population in terms of genes and in terms
of morphological features, and if you

00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:50.200
reduce the size of this population-- if
you reduce it dramatically, and then

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:56.150
re-expand this population, you are going
to have, again, a large population, but

00:17:56.150 --> 00:18:01.860
with reduced variability just by chance.
Just because only some of these features

00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:07.790
went through this bottleneck. And we have
something like that with Neanderthals

00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:13.810
along the Neanderthal lineage- I could go
through several features, cranial

00:18:13.810 --> 00:18:18.760
features, facial features. I'll just pick
one example which what we call

00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:24.080
non-metrical dental features. And these
non-metrical dental features have a

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:29.610
frequency that increases along the
Neanderthal lineage. We know they were

00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:35.900
part of the variability of Neanderthals of
the middle Pleistocine hominids before the

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:42.050
Neanderthal emerges, and they seem to be
fixed a little bit by chance in

00:18:42.050 --> 00:18:48.220
Neanderthals and reach a very high
frequency in later forms. So what could

00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:57.540
drive this evolution? We think this jerky
curve that you saw several times already,

00:18:57.540 --> 00:19:05.770
in this period of time, say around 800 to
400,000, becomes even more jerky. And we

00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:13.190
have 600,000 years ago for the first time,
first major glacial episode in western

00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:19.680
Eurasia. We think that this first major
glacial episode resulted in, for the first

00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:27.190
time, an isolation of western Eurasia, and
a dramatic reduction of the population

00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:31.020
living there.
This is confirmed also, now, by

00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:40.860
paleogenetics using the high-resolution
sequencing of Neanderthal genomes. It is

00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:47.090
possible to make assumptions on the
evolution of the population size through

00:19:47.090 --> 00:19:52.180
time, and we see that contrary to what we
have in the ancestry of modern humans, we

00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:59.400
have around five to 600,000-- dramatic
reduction of the population size of this

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:05.700
group. So the story unfolds this way: we
have in the early Pleistocene western

00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:11.540
Eurasian hominids, we still see a lot of
changes between southwest Asia, Africa,

00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:18.410
central Asia, western Eurasia. And with
the isotopic stage 16, about 600,000

00:20:18.410 --> 00:20:23.110
years, we have probably for the first
time, this separation that matched the

00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:30.090
genetic data. We have another major
bottleneck with isotopic stage 12, and

00:20:30.090 --> 00:20:36.690
soon after, this is when we have for the
first time, Neanderthal features emerging

00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:44.650
in the phenotype of European hominids. And
let's say 200,000 years later, after a

00:20:44.650 --> 00:20:51.980
number of bottlenecks, we have basically
fixed this Neanderthal morphology. So to

00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:59.380
finish I would just like to say one word
about Neanderthal extinction, and I think

00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:05.090
I-- I hope I convinced you that climate
played a major role in the rise of the

00:21:05.090 --> 00:21:09.350
Neanderthals. The question is, did the
climate play a role in the fall of the

00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:18.120
Neanderthals? There's a number of theories
about that, that Neanderthals got extinct

00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:21.560
naturally before modern humans moved into
Europe.

00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:28.350
What we think about the emergence of
modern humans into Europe is a scenario

00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:33.540
that is a bit more complicated today than
it was a few years ago. We think we have

00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:39.530
two major episodes of colonization of
western Eurasia, one corresponding to what

00:21:39.530 --> 00:21:45.940
we call initial [inaudible 00:21:42]
sometime around 48,000. And a later one

00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:53.840
for western Eurasia around 42 to 43,000.
It has been argued that in this time

00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:59.270
period, the climactic curve is especially
jerky, and that that would have driven the

00:21:59.270 --> 00:22:04.060
Neanderthal to extinction before-- or
facilitate the replacement by modern

00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:11.850
humans. Well, I think when you look at
this curve it is very difficult to see

00:22:11.850 --> 00:22:17.950
more jerkiness in this period than before.
I think Neanderthals survived all sort of

00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:24.610
climactic changes before modern humans
arrived in western Eurasia, and I think

00:22:24.610 --> 00:22:32.271
the main disaster Neanderthals had to face
was not a climatic disaster: it was us.

00:22:32.271 --> 00:22:34.546
Thank you.
