00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:03.540
Let's do some more
percentage problems.

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.130
Let's say that I start
this year in my stock

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.520
portfolio with $95.00.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:26.010
And I say that my portfolio
grows by, let's say, 15%.

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:31.480
How much do I have now?

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.780
OK.

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.900
I think you might be able to
figure this out on your own,

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.426
but of course we'll do some
example problems, just in case

00:00:45.426 --> 00:00:46.710
it's a little confusing.

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.440
So I'm starting with $95.00,
and I'll get rid of

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.090
the dollar sign.

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:51.910
We know we're working
with dollars.

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.220
95 dollars, right?

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.410
And I'm going to earn, or I'm
going to grow just because

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.170
I was an excellent stock
investor, that 95 dollars

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.730
is going to grow by 15%.

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:11.090
So to that 95 dollars, I'm
going to add another 15% of 95.

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:18.880
So we know we write 15% as a
decimal, as 0.15, so 95 plus

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.540
0.15 of 95, so this is
times 95-- that dot

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:24.780
is just a times sign.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.890
It's not a decimal, it's a
times, it's a little higher

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.790
than a decimal-- So 95 plus
0.15 times 95 is what

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.390
we have now, right?

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.410
Because we started with 95
dollars, and then we made

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:40.630
another 15% times what
we started with.

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:41.940
Hopefully that make sense.

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.330
Another way to say it, the 95
dollars has grown by 15%.

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:47.940
So let's just work this out.

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:55.460
This is the same thing as 95
plus-- what's 0.15 times 95?

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:56.480
Let's see.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.420
So let me do this, hopefully
I'll have enough space here.

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.640
95 times 0.15-- I don't
want to run out of space.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.130
Actually, let me do it up here,
I think I'm about to run out

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:11.780
of space-- 95 times 0.15.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:21.730
5 times 5 is 25, 9 times 5 is
45 plus 2 is 47, 1 times 95 is

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:29.580
95, bring down the 5,
12, carry the 1, 15.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:30.880
And how many decimals
do we have?

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.300
1, 2.

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.666
15.25.

00:02:35.666 --> 00:02:37.230
Actually, is that right?

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.250
I think I made a mistake here.

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.100
See 5 times 5 is 25.

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:49.045
5 times 9 is 45, plus 2 is 47.

00:02:49.045 --> 00:02:55.500
And we bring the 0 here, it's
95, 1 times 5, 1 times 9, then

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.500
we add 5 plus 0 is 5,
7 plus 5 is 12-- oh.

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.790
See?

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:01.465
I made a mistake.

00:03:01.465 --> 00:03:06.260
It's 14.25, not 15.25.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.100
So I'll ask you an
interesting question?

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.580
How did I know that
15.25 was a mistake?

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.310
Well, I did a reality check.

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.830
I said, well, I know in my head
that 15% of 100 is 15, so if

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:25.800
15% of 100 is 15, how can
15% of 95 be more than 15?

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.500
I think that might
have made sense.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.790
The bottom line is 95
is less than 100.

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.460
So 15% of 95 had to be less
than 15, so I knew my

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:35.560
answer of 15.25 was wrong.

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.940
And so it turns out that I
actually made an addition

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.750
error, and the answer is 14.25.

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.980
So the answer is going to be 95
plus 15% of 95, which is the

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:57.570
same thing as 95 plus 14.25,
well, that equals what?

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:05.350
109.25.

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.560
Notice how easy I made
this for you to read,

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:08.920
especially this 2 here.

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.490
109.25.

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:13.990
So if I start off with $95.00
and my portfolio grows-- or the

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:17.430
amount of money I have-- grows
by 15%, I'll end

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.432
up with $109.25.

00:04:21.432 --> 00:04:22.660
Let's do another problem.

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:31.490
Let's say I start off with some
amount of money, and after a

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:47.260
year, let's says my portfolio
grows 25%, and after growing

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:56.320
25%, I now have $100.

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.810
How much did I originally have?

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.750
Notice I'm not saying that
the $100 is growing by 25%.

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:07.280
I'm saying that I start with
some amount of money, it grows

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:13.780
by 25%, and I end up with
$100 after it grew by 25%.

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.010
To solve this one, we
might have to break out

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:17.640
a little bit of algebra.

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:22.480
So let x equal what
I start with.

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:34.070
So just like the last problem,
I start with x and it grows by

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:43.450
25%, so x plus 25% of x is
equal to 100, and we know this

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:52.190
25% of x we can just rewrite as
x plus 0.25 of x is equal to

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:56.900
100, and now actually we have a
level-- actually this might be

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:01.820
level 3 system, level 3 linear
equation-- but the bottom

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:05.075
line, we can just add the
coefficients on the x.

00:06:05.075 --> 00:06:07.350
x is the same thing
as 1x, right?

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:12.790
So 1x plus 0.25x, well that's
just the same thing as 1 plus

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:16.310
0.25, plus x-- we're just doing
the distributive property

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:18.960
in reverse-- equals 100.

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.090
And what's 1 plus 0.25?

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:23.360
That's easy, it's 1.25.

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:31.960
So we say 1.25x
is equal to 100.

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:32.650
Not too hard.

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:34.770
And after you do a lot of these
problems, you're going to

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:39.370
intuitively say, oh, if some
number grows by 25%, and it

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:42.615
becomes 100, that means that
1.25 times that number

00:06:42.615 --> 00:06:44.480
is equal to 100.

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:46.640
And if this doesn't make sense,
sit and think about it a little

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:50.110
bit, maybe rewatch the video,
and hopefully it'll, over time,

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:51.610
start to make a lot
of sense to you.

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:53.740
This type of math is
very very useful.

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:55.900
I actually work at a hedge
fund, and I'm doing

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:58.960
this type of math in my
head day and night.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:06.660
So 1.25 times x is equal
to 100, so x would equal

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:10.680
100 divided by 1.25.

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:11.730
I just realized you
probably don't know

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:12.910
what a hedge fund is.

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:14.950
I invest in stocks
for a living.

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:16.640
Anyway, back to the math.

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:19.900
So x is equal to 100
divided by 1.25.

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:25.570
So let me make some space
here, just because I

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:28.430
used up too much space.

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:31.060
Let me get rid of my
little let x statement.

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:34.500
Actually I think we know
what x is and we know

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:36.620
how we got to there.

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:38.570
If you forgot how we got
there, you can I guess

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:39.590
rewatch the video.

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:43.110
Let's see.

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:47.600
Let me make the pen thin
again, and go back to

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.600
the orange color, OK.

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:55.590
X equals 100 divided by 1.25,
so we say 1.25 goes into

00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:59.410
100.00-- I'm going to add a
couple of 0's, I don't know how

00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:01.720
many I'm going to need,
probably added too many-- if I

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:06.150
move this decimal over two to
the right, I need to move this

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:07.450
one over two to the right.

00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:14.410
And I say how many times does
100 go into 100-- how many

00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:16.660
times does 125 go into 100?

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:17.530
None.

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:19.420
How many times does
it go into 1000?

00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:21.010
It goes into it eight times.

00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:24.130
I happen to know that in my
head, but you could do trial

00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:25.580
and error and think about it.

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:28.490
8 times-- if you want to think
about it, 8 times 100 is

00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:32.600
800, and then 8 times 25 is
200, so it becomes 1000.

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:34.480
You could work out if you like,
but I think I'm running out of

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:36.370
time, so I'm going
to do this fast.

00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:39.920
8 times 125 is 1000.

00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:42.600
Remember this thing isn't here.

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:48.370
1000, so 1000 minus 1000 is 0,
so you can bring down the 0.

00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:52.900
125 goes into 0 zero times,
and we just keep getting 0's.

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:55.680
This is just a decimal
division problem.

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:59.500
So it turns out that if your
portfolio grew by 25% and

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:05.120
you ended up with $100.00
you started with $80.00.

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:09.650
And that makes sense, because
25% is roughly 1/4, right?

00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:13.590
So if I started with $80.00 and
I grow by 1/4, that means I

00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:17.660
grew by $20, because
25% of 80 is 20.

00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:21.020
So if I start with 80
and I grow by 20,

00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:22.740
that gets me to 100.

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:24.020
Makes sense.

00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:28.070
So remember, all you have to
say is, well, some number times

00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:32.950
1.25-- because I'm growing
it by 25%-- is equal to 100.

00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:36.240
Don't worry, if you're still
confused, I'm going to add at

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:38.500
least one more presentation
on a couple of more

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:40.440
examples like this.
