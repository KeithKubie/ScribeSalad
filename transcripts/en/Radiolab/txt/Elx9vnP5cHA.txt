Speaker 1:          00:04          [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          00:05          You're listening to radiolab from New York public radio, public radio,W Y, y c

Speaker 3:          00:17          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:18          testing, testing. This is radio lab. I'm Jad Abumrad and I'm Robert Krulwich. And since this hour we'll be talking about brains and bodies and how they communicate. We thought we'd begin the program with a guy with that we'd go to quite often he knows about this sort of thing. Oliver Sacks. Oliver is a neurologist. Should I get closer to very famous author? Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:38          Took us to his study to show us something that just fascinates him.

Speaker 1:          00:42          Um, I've become fascinated. I'm instantly, I hope you have to be careful with your watch or your computers.

Speaker 4:          00:50          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          00:51          um, he showed us a silver ball. I should just describe here I am looking at a silver bowl about the size of a small, small ping pong ball, which he handed to you, right? Yep.

Speaker 1:          01:00          Would you care to lift that, that little steel ball this little, and as soon as he did, I am

Speaker 3:          01:09          interesting.

Speaker 2:          01:10          The ball went flying through the air, taking your hand with it, smack into the nearest bit of metal in the vicinity, which was a plate. Little tear left very fast and it hurt. Wow.

Speaker 1:          01:20          That'd be cool. I've got a cat. Okay. I don't put it too near your watch. And also you have to put it down very gently. Otherwise it may fly with great violence onto this nickel slam. What is that and what are we talking about it? Okay. Um, well this is a little rare earth metal magnet of great strength.

Speaker 4:          01:40          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          01:41          these magnets orient themselves almost violently to the earth's magnetic field. If you have a couple of these things, say in your pockets and you go for a walk, as you turn a corner, you will feel them really at themselves in your pockets. I like like little animals.

Speaker 3:          02:00          So your, your pockets would tell you whether you were going north, south, east or west.

Speaker 1:          02:06          Good. So whenever you have the way with magnets and

Speaker 3:          02:11          how you hear very weird man, how would you propose to use this? In what situation that you have imagined? Would it be a happy advantage? Well. Um, I, I myself, I'm always getting lost. I have, I have no sense of direction. I would function [inaudible] come downtown to meet me. You would know because of the pressure on your thighs from these little balls that you were carrying out, whether you were going downtown or not downtown. You see, and I may need things like this. I am very bad at all. Anting myself in space. He's

Speaker 2:          02:45          trying to do with the birds too, right? Bird because birds have magnets in their brains are or something like magnets which lets them fly south so they know where it is. They fly it when they're migrating, right? Yeah. He's trying to start a conversation like a bird, but because he's choosing his thighs,

Speaker 3:          03:00          he wants his thighs to talk to his brain. I've often wondered as an aside, uh, the extent to which one, um, one could develop a new sense.

Speaker 5:          03:11          That's what this hour of radio lab is about. Human beings, not just Oliver, all kinds of folks who are attempting to add census and mostly to subtract. Since we'll have stories about both adding and losing sentences in more generally, you look at how brains and bodies communicate, often fail to communicate because believe it or not, it's not an easy relationship between your brain and your body. There's a lot of confusion, deception, even. That's what new research shows. And we'll get into all of that. So let's get into it. Alright. Okay. Ready? Yeah, we're first, well, let's begin with on urology.

Speaker 3:          03:49          Um, well listen, my cell phone is ringing, so let me pause until it stops. So that's Robert Sapolsky. He's a professor of biology at Stanford. I've never figured out how to do voice messaging or whatever it is even has done in this century. Prisoners of I machine. Yes. Oh, okay. We're in business here. Okay, so to begin now, I said to Robert Sapolsky just to get my head around this. Let's imagine it. I decided to visit my best friend

Speaker 5:          04:15          in the world, Tommy, Tommy. I walk over to his house. I have a key. So I opened the front door, Tommy, I walk into his apartment and then I see him sprawled on the floor, dead

Speaker 6:          04:34          [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          04:34          and in a horrible, tragic, instant like that, I wonder what would be going on in my brain. And I asked this because his answer is supposed to the answer. It was so weird.

Speaker 3:          04:45          According to some Polsky, what happens happens in the following order. First Light bounces off Tommy's corpse and Andrew's my eye. Okay? It goes up some nerve from your eyes and into one part of the brain, which turfs it onto the next part. And then the inflammation keeps moving. A couple of steps down. It gets into what's called your visual Cortex, which turns the dots into lines and lines into shapes. And that's just like a local train. You're taking eventually that local train carrying the image of timing kg and chug deeper into my brain, to my cortex. And after a few more stops, I will finally know, I will consciously know the Tommy is dead. But now here's the surprise. Information can move through the brain in different ways at the same time. And there is a second route, it turns, there's a second pathway into my body, into my nervous system, which bypasses all of that visual cortex stuff like a bullet train and goes straight to this area called the Amygdala.

Speaker 3:          05:47          And what the Amygdala does is instantly it tells the heart to pound your heart speeds up the stomach to clinch stomach muscles, clench tears to flow, and you're still a couple of seconds away from like even consciously making sense of what you're seeing. And by then already your stomach is heading towards your throat or your throat's in your mouth or whatever the cliche is. So as I'm standing there in Tommy's apartment looking at this figure on the ground before I even know what I'm looking at before, I am consciously aware that Tommy is dead. My body already knows that's exactly the punchline. Your body knows that before you consciously know it. Right? Which is an astonishing idea. It is astonishing, but it's not a new idea. Yeah. This goes back to what was originally viewed as this totally asinine theory in psychology back around 1,901 of the, you know, grand old poop laws of psychology, William James, Dean James,

Speaker 2:          06:48          and he's trying to answer the question where feelings came from. That's Jonah Leora science writer. He really likes William James. He's written a lot about him and he says, a hundred years ago, William James poses a thought experiment. He gives the example of a bear. He says, imagine you're walking through the woods. All of a sudden I'm behind a tree.

Speaker 7:          07:07          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          07:07          the bear attacks. Any wonder William James did. Okay, so the bear attacks, you're going to feel scared. But what exactly is that feeling of fear made of? Which seems like a strange question to ask. Yeah, but, but he, he was trying to be empirical about it. He was trying to be a good psychologist. And his answer was that the feeling is the perception of your body, meaning step one, you see the bear, you see a bear with his teeth and his claws. Step two, your body response, a fast heartbeat, the adrenaline cursing in your bloodstream. And it's only in step three. When the brain sees the body respond, does it, then it trigger the feeling,

Speaker 2:          07:45          a fear, and the feeling of fear comes from the perception of those changes in your body. If you took away the heartbeat, if you took away the body, there'd be nothing left to feel. Needless to say, when William James proposed this idea, people absolutely crazy, he was nuts, completely nuts. They said, you know, if you're right, then someone who's paralyzed from the neck down and who doesn't get signals from their body, well that person would see the bear in the woods and they wouldn't get scared, which is ridiculous. Completely ridiculous. So the critics said, William James is wrong, dead wrong, and that's the end of it. Yeah, the

Speaker 3:          08:20          end of it. Hello. We happened to bump into a neurologist, Antonio Damasio, director of the brain and creativity institute at the University of Southern California. Wow. What a nice place. So we're sitting near with demasio. We happened to be talking about William James and his critics, which we always do always do on, you know, lunch. We don't go into a luncheonette for lunch and before we order a tuna fish sandwich, we always mentioned William James in his critics. This is something we do. So I said to the, I said, Demasio, you know the critics call James Wrong because he said people who were paralyzed couldn't feel anything and he says you, it's funny you should

Speaker 1:          08:56          mention this because there's been a series of studies thinking about James One more time and it's very interesting because the first study that was made in this area, it was made by a paraplegic psychologist who thought that he felt less emotional than he was before and he talked to others and others reported the same. The studies reported that people who had once been able bodied and then became paralyzed, felt less, less happy than able bodied people, less sad, been able body people just less. Our B is rooted in a body state. If I would be able to remove from your brain the representation of your body, you would not know that you are you and would I not be sorry at my friend's death? You definitely would not be started at anything. What is in fact the essence of being joyful or sad. If you don't hook those notions on a changed body, he's right. You know? I mean, if you think about the last time you were sad, like really sad, how would you describe that feeling to yourself? Right. In fairness when I guess I would, I would say I felt dragged out and heavy. Yeah. That feeling is completely rooted in your flesh. Well, brain has nothing to do with that thought. Made me say it and then my body,

Speaker 8:          10:31          hold on. Hello? Oh, hi. Yeah. Hold on one second. Is Your wife here?

Speaker 9:          10:44          Hello? Robert? Yeah. I can't believe you still there. What are you doing there? What do you mean? Am I doing here? You're supposed to be home an hour ago in the studio. We were on the, I don't care. What do you mean you're supposed to be home an hour ago. I reminded you this morning. I reminded you last night. I was pissed. Not Important to you. This is not such a big deal. I'll be back in. Actually this just an example we've been talking about. No. Robert's having a fight with his wife, Tamar, and while he's fighting inside his body, his stomach is clenching his hardest. Palpitating. Hers is doing the same, but their brains are picking up these signals. I'm thinking anger. They feel angry.

Speaker 9:          11:25          As important as your WIC screwed it up. How did I screw it up? How did I screw up your job though? At a certain point, Robert will probably realize he has screwed up and just get home. He'll apologize if I get home in 20 minutes. I'm really sorry. I know this is horrible. I said, yeah, yeah, it's just a second. I'm really sorry. Okay. He'd be like, no. When it comes to brains and bodies and men and women. The interesting thing is that when a man and woman fight these systems in their body, the heart, the stomach clenching,

Speaker 2:          11:54          while these systems do turn on at the same speed and it takes like two seconds according to Robert Spolsky where there's an interesting gender difference is how long it takes to turn off the system and ladies, sorry, in advance and in general it turns off more slowly in women than in men, which may explain something that happens to couples all the time.

Speaker 3:          12:13          Okay, good. I'm really sorry this isn't right. I know. Oh, I'm really sorry. Like here we are. Maybe like maybe later we'll go do something or I'm really sorry. Robert Stomach is relaxing. This is really stupid. I know. His heart is slowly very stupid. He thinks the fight might be over.

Speaker 10:         12:32          Okay.

Speaker 9:          12:35          You know, this is something you do all the time. When we were having a dinner right after we got engaged and we went to the restaurant and I was waiting for you and I've made the reservation for like 45 minutes. You didn't even call it just you didn't.

Speaker 2:          12:52          Did you hear what just happened there? It's this way of even James stuff coming back to haunt us a century later. Topolski says sometimes the body actually tricks. The brain. Tame knows the fight is over mentally, but her body's still tense. Her heart is still racing and her brain thinks, Whoa, wait, if my heart is still racing and I consciously know that this issue has been resolved, it must be because I'm still pissed off about that thing that happened in the Carter Administration.

Speaker 9:          13:16          Minimize every day. Maybe it goes for you.

Speaker 3:          13:18          Brain fills a vacuum. We have a list. You have a list there?

Speaker 9:          13:21          I do. I have a long list. I didn't know how often you do this sort of thing. I do it like one. I can tell them this year the babies are calls. I'm going to be out of town and says, should I make dinner for Robert? Because quickly you can't make dinner for yourself and the kids. No, I do make dinner. I haven't made much of anything. Potatoes. Last week, Wednesday I made the big potatoes. That's just applying heat.

Speaker 3:          13:52          I want to thank my wife, Tamer Lewin for what I think was a pretty startling lead that really, I mean, performance switch. I don't know how she did that because it's so unlike the rest of our marriage. You know this story by the way, came from Robert Sapolsky and he tells it about his wife too, but they're not reporters. They're scientists, so they do it differently. My wife's in the same business as me, so the very words we will say to each other is, honey, don't forget what the half life is on the autonomic nervous system. Then suddenly it's all over with. That's such a rare exchange between two people. You know? I

Speaker 2:          14:27          know. We're just sentiment. By the way. Robert Spolski's latest book is called Monkey Love, which is where that anecdote came from. Ed. Speaking of brains and bodies [inaudible] let's put the science on pause for a moment and take a brief detour because often what gets you into these ideas, like take this kid, for example, Christopher seals go to the Blake high school isn't the science. It's more basic than that. It seems something disgusting and not being able to look away. You really just can't believe that if something feels like this, it actually came out of a real person. You just don't get the feeling. When we bumped into Christopher, he was gingerly holding a pair of human lungs, but it is a real person, but you just can't really associate with a real person because it's there in front of you and it doesn't look like real person in case. That sense of, whoa. That's why we originally went to the Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington d c but here's what happened. Our tour guide.

Speaker 8:          15:28          Okay, Steven S. T. E. V. E. N. Solomon, s. O. L. O. M. O.

Speaker 2:          15:32          He showed us the particular photo that got us thinking

Speaker 8:          15:36          a famous photo in our archives. It's called field day.

Speaker 2:          15:39          It's a civil war photo hanging in a sign gallery. It's a picture of legs.

Speaker 8:          15:46          Kyle have amputated legs, a huge heap of severed legs, some feet thrown sort of haphazardly into a pile.

Speaker 2:          15:55          Wow. It's oddly beautiful in a way, gruesome, gruesome, but the next thought immediately after was what was happening at that moment. Right to one side of the picture frame must've been an operating table and on the table, soldier inhaling chloroform and at the foot of the table must've been a doctor signing away,

Speaker 8:          16:17          a circular amputation involved cutting straight through the skin to the bone. A flap amputation required the tissue to be cut in two flaps of skin that were used to create a stump and in fact your typical army surgeon was basically graded on how quickly they could do an amputation. That was one of the first,

Speaker 2:          16:36          they really had doctors being aggressive in terms of taking off limbs. Like I said, that photo got us thinking, so we went back to Jonah Lehrer who has written how about a very ghostly side effect that pops up during the civil war as a direct result of all of that, taking off of limbs, this, this one astonishing syndrome that these men who have had their limbs taken off, they describe very, very often this a very common thing that they still feel their phantom limbs. They say they feel it. Yeah. They say, doctor, I, I still feel it. Move. They can feel it hurt. Get through that. Sometimes get hot sometimes very cold. Imagine you're a civil war doctor and you hear this. He, you don't even know what germs are yet. But one guy, Dr Silas, where Mitchell decides he's going to get to the bottom of it, the first thing he did was he wrote some clinical reports only. Yeah.

Speaker 8:          17:24          About 5% of the men who have suffered amputation never have any feeling of the part as being still present, um, and circulated them or in the hospital while the remainders seemed to retain a sense of its existence. So vivid as to be more definite and intrusive than it is of the truly living fellow member. The stump is liable to the most horrible [inaudible] and to a certain curious spasmodic paralysis.

Speaker 11:         17:49          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          17:49          no one could make sense of this. Even our Guy William James, even he looks into it, he did a very authoritative study where he sent out questionnaires to all these amputee victims and wanting to know about their lost limbs. He has all of these civil war amputees, all these questions, does your phantom limb hurt? Can you move it? If you really concentrate? And what he found was that there were no patterns, no stereotypical loss limb every, every experience was different. In other words, phantom limbs are like real limbs. They're yours.

Speaker 3:          18:20          Well, on this topic of Phantom limbs, there is a guy who has figured at least something out about this phenomenon. Dr v S Ramachandra. I am a v S Ramachandra. Remember him? I remember him. He's a well known neurologist. He works in California at the University of California, San Diego. And one day he says, a patient showed up in his office and it seems that the guy had had his arm amputated. It was his left arm. And then ever since this man had an uncanny feeling that he still had an arm where his real arm used to be. Yes, it's important to emphasize this is not a delusion. He doesn't think he has an arm. He knows he doesn't. He's not crazy, but he vividly feels it's presence. And the rough part was that this arm eat hurt. This sometimes happens to people with phantom limbs. He would have days where his phantom arm would seize up in pain.

Speaker 3:          19:10          Doctor, it hurts really badly. Goes into this painful clenching spasm. The nails dig into my palm. So he has a phantom hand at the end of his phantom limb. Yes, and he will say things like, it's going into a cramp with the nails digging into the phantom palm and it's excruciatingly painful, but there are no nails. There is no no problem. And weirdest of all, the patient couldn't do anything about it. He try to unclench his phantom nails from his phantom palm to make the pain stop, but he couldn't. He said, I cannot move the fountain. The fandom I'm wouldn't obey. I cannot volitionally move it. And I started thinking to myself, what does he mean when he says he cannot move his phantom limb like an oxymoron? There is no arm there.

Speaker 3:          19:55          Drew Ramachandran was confused what's going on. He, he checked with the patient and discovered that 11 years earlier, before the amputation, he'd had an injury to his spine and after that his real left arm was paralyzed. He could not move it. He tried his brain would issue the commands. His brain will say move the arm. But he was getting visual feedback and indeed feedback from his muscles saying, nope, move the arm. No move. No. And this went on for months, move. No, so maybe the doctor Rameshchandra maybe this patient got so frustrated trying to move his real arm that at some point, after a few months or a year, the paralysis [inaudible] learnt by the brain snapping into the circuitry of the brain.

Speaker 3:          20:40          Well, I call it learned, learned paralysis. So even when they cut the patients, I'm off a year after the accident, he still didn't get any relief because the problem wasn't in his arm. It was learned paralysis. It was in his head. Now, and that is when Ramachandra thought, well, maybe the solution here is to trick this man's brain to unparalyzed to get his cells to think, well actually we can move on, but how do you trick a brain? How would you do that? How would you do that? How would you do that? How would you do that? Indeed, he thought for a bit.

Speaker 12:         21:15          Then I hit on this way of using a mirror prompt inside a cardboard box. What a mirror mirror prompt inside a cardboard box. A mirror pro parked inside a box popped up. Oh,

Speaker 3:          21:28          it was kind of a home depot solution. Really. Ramachandran took a long and skinny mirror. The kind you'd hang on a closet door, right? Any propped it up using a cardboard box and then turned it sideways. Place the side right in front of the patient like right on his nose because he couldn't see himself. No, couldn't see anything in the mirror yet unless he hooked his neck around. Took a p. Oh, otherwise he's just looking at the side. Ramesh Arjun says, I want you to imagine this with me. Jeff says, I want you to take your good on your real arm. Okay? And stick it out in front of the mirror. So do that. Okay, now make it do what the phantom arm does. Pick your good arm. Make it stiff. Curl your hand into a fist. Dig Your fingernails into your palm deeply. Make it hurt. You're doing that. It's kind of hurting. Now when I tell you, Cook your head so that you can look into the mirror and on your left, just where your the fandom ought to be. Let's pretend that that's your phantom arm. It's cramped. It's curled exactly as you'd imagine it. So now look in the mirror, okay? And there's your arm. You see it there and nearer your phantom arm. Got It. Now very slowly keeping your eye on the mirror. Now I want you to [inaudible] curl your hand.

Speaker 12:         22:38          Patient says, okay, he opens his real hand, my God, and of course it looks like his phantom is opening. That's not surprising. He's got do the mirror there, but he says, my God, doctor, you're not going to believe this. The movements of all comeback, all these movements in my fingers, in my elbow, in my wrist from 11 years ago, come flooding into my mind. So it was his pretend nails

Speaker 3:          23:01          are now ungripping from his pretend palm in the whole problem of the pretend pain goes away, goes away. That's what he said. For how long? By the way, total. The middle was in place. But when Dr Rameshchandra took away the mirrors, the pain came back.

Speaker 12:         23:19          I said, fine, say, let me, you know, and then I said, look, why don't you practice with a mirror for the few weeks, every day for an hour. Then maybe if you do it repeatedly, you can unlearn the learn to pain. So this guy goes home, I told him, you give him a mirror to take home. Correct. And if it was $22 take it with you. So he texted with him, he was delighted. And then after about another week, he phones and he sounds all agitated on the phone. And I said, what's going on? So doctor, you're not going to believe this. It's gone. I said, what's going on? I thought maybe the mirror was gone. He said, no, no, not the mirror. The Phantom has gone, gone. Go on. God. That's what I said. Gone. Gone. What do you mean fandom was going? He it? Well, this phantom arm I been having for the last 11 years, it's disappeared.

Speaker 12:         24:06          Well, my, my, my initial reaction was alarm. I said, my God, does this bother you? That it cause it, no. You know, this has happened three days ago and in the last three days you remember the excruciating elbow pain and wrist pain. I've got several times a day, but I don't have them anymore because I don't have an arm. But my fingers they have not disappeared and they're still up here dangling near my shoulder. They're still painful. You mean just disconnected? Disembodied fingerless yeah. Finger looks dangling from the shoulder. What? W what does that mean? This guy's saying that he seems to have fingertips hanging on his shoulder.

Speaker 12:         24:50          He said you a mirror doesn't work anymore, so can you redesign it and push it properly near my nose so I can look at that reflection and maybe get, get rid of the fingers. So he now wants to get Dr Ramachandra to prop up the mirror, point them at these phantom fingertips and have the mirror erase the fingertip. You thought I was a magician and I got, you know, eliminate his different body parts and sequence. And this is amputation by mirror? Yeah. As I tell my medical colleagues jokingly, I say, this is the first example in the history of medicine of a successful amputation of a phantom limb. Yeah, so don't leave me hanging here. Did the phantom fingers eventually dissolve? No. Vv we still haven't. Have they been able to devise a technique to get them and it turns out that the pain there subsided a bit, so he's not that worried about us getting rid of him. So somewhere in California there's still a guy walking around with a sense, fingers on his shoulder. Yeah. Are still dangling. Another shoulder, which is, well, not only weird, it suggests that there's an awful lot to know about how brains and bodies interact. Many things to learn, but for a work at day doc who has to deal with whatever comes through the door. Dr Rameshchandra and had what I would call a pretty good day at the office. Yes, exactly.

Speaker 12:         26:07          Yes. Ramachandran is a neuroscientist at the University of California in San Diego, author of many books, including a brief tour of human consciousness, which is where you can find out all about the mirror.

Speaker 2:          26:18          Right next up. Let's scale it up a bit. We're going to go from lost limbs to a guy who's lost everything. His entire sense of his body. I'm Jad Abumrad Robert Krulwich and I will continue in a moment.

Speaker 14:         27:45          Sometimes what seems so clearly like the right decision ends up being one you regret and really great expectations for how it's like basketball. I was going to pee. Hi Radiolab listeners. I'm Anna sale, host of death, sex and money from W NYC studios. And this week we have stories of people with big dreams and big debt, student loan debt, 10 grand, 80,000 7,500, $300,000. Listen to the latest death, sex, and money wherever you get your podcast.

Speaker 8:          28:21          This is Radiolab. I'm Jad Abumrad red, I'm Robert Krulwich. And in this hour on radio lab, we're talking about the relationship, sometimes the uneasy relationship between the brain and the body.

Speaker 3:          28:32          I think most people will who have brains and that would include, I think most of the listeners here, uh, think the relationship between brain and body is more like the relationship of a commander to a command D, right? The brain makes the orders and the body response. But I think the more accurate way is to think of this as a conversation between the brain and the body. How do you mean? Well because any movement, even a very basic one, let's just say a wagging my tongue. Okay? Very simple really, but it still involves three steps. First, the brain has to issue the command

Speaker 15:         29:07          tongue, face and tongue station. This is mission control, commence wagon.

Speaker 3:          29:10          Second, the command must be executed [inaudible] third. Now this is the crucial step. The tongue. In this case, we ports back to the brain.

Speaker 15:         29:19          All we have a wagging. I repeat, we have wagons.

Speaker 3:          29:22          Yeah. By completing the loop,

Speaker 15:         29:23          you control the foot. Come in full mission control. This is here, me here coordinates over to Roger that Michigan,

Speaker 3:          29:28          yeah, this happens, this conversation you're hanging right now. [inaudible] or Alpha. It happens constantly all over your body. Your brain is issuing commands. Come in, let me, parts of your body are receiving the command and reporting right leg standing by

Speaker 1:          29:42          and this conversation adds up to something really quite important. It ends up to his sense of yourself. It's an unconscious sense which really allows you to move normally. That's Oliver sacks again, the neurologist we talked to at the start of the program, you have of course a sense of smell and of touch and of taste. He says this sixth sense also has a name sometimes called proprioception. Proprioception. Proprioception is the unconscious sense by which the position of one's limbs, the posture of one's body is automatically monitored. Now imagine he says what would happen if all of a sudden this sixth sense, this conversation that you are always having with your body, suppose it went away when we all have this in a slight way. For example, if you go to the dentist and sometimes half of your mouth or your tongue is numbed, the tongue may feel very large. You may grab the Dental Mirror to reassure yourself that all is okay and there's does and it doesn't reassure you. You can still wag your tongue. Your brain is still sending messages to the tone control. The tongue isn't sending messages back anymore so you can you anything. You know that feeling?

Speaker 3:          31:06          Yeah, of course. Now. Could you imagine that instead of just losing your tongue, your tongue not responding, suppose your whole body doesn't respond. Okay.

Speaker 1:          31:17          What would that be like? I mean, we have words like deaf or blind. We don't have a word for being ineffective, deaf and blind to one's own body.

Speaker 3:          31:30          And yet there are people who have a condition that rare and that horrible. No proprioception. We talked to such a person, Ian Waterman and convinced him and his doctor and very good friend Jonathan Cole to crowd themselves into a very little recording studio and fully of the other, the BBC. Fantastic. Southampton in England. Hello America. And we ask them to talk to us. Hello? Oh, you got a sexy voice. Ah, and you hear us? Can you hear me? Your other? Hi, we can. I can thank you guys for coming and doing this with us. Yeah. Will you just ask us some questions and we'll answer them as best we can far away. All right, well let me just start it then. Now can you remember, I'm sure you can. What happened that led to this total change in your life?

Speaker 16:         32:22          So it began with what I thought was, um, uh, a batch of the flu or a very heavy, heavy cold. And uh, I was at the shop, probably worked and felt tired and lethargic. The guy that owned the, the shop look, you know, you look on, well go home, take it easy. I took the day off, went home and I've always been pretty energetic and I hate being stuck in doors and whatever. And I thought, well, the fresh year will do me some good. It's got to the shed and pulled the motor mower out, pulled the what out with, what's the, what do you call it? The mower. The lawnmower out of the shed. I thought it's going to be one of those cultural moments where you guys call it something else. No, not quite. And pulled the uh, lawnmower out of the shed and primed it up and started it and it started chugging away and as I engage the gear

Speaker 17:         33:09          off it went and I couldn't keep up with it. It was a fairly slowly and punters sort of lonely and I just stood there bemused thinking, how come I just can't keep up with the money and didn't really, uh, attend too much more than, you know, I'm just tired and sluggish and lethargic and, and went back to my bedroom and laid down and did some seriously thing. And the following morning I went to get up and out of bed and collapsed against the radio twice. Fell, slid, fell, tumbled out of the bed and fell against the radiator.

Speaker 11:         33:47          [inaudible]

Speaker 16:         33:47          it's very difficult to do, to describe

Speaker 11:         33:50          [inaudible]

Speaker 17:         33:50          as I lay there and I was laying flat. I had a rippling sensation in my tummy around the ankles, a a tingling sensation for once we've had a chairman, I felt disembodied

Speaker 11:         34:02          [inaudible]

Speaker 16:         34:04          I remember waking up with a hand on my face and not realizing that it was mine. Simple movement, simple movements. The simplest of movements. Pick up a cup to eat, to eat. The biscuits are suddenly very hard by couldn't control anything. Totally. I mean, from the neck down. I had no control over over my limbs and for the next 12 years he went from hospital to hospital. Doctors couldn't help him because he'd never seen anything quite this drastic until they finally did meet a doctor, Jonathan Cole, who began to help him figure out what might be going on. So let me ask Jonathan for a second. What is wrong with the n he had at the Italian, he had his eldest last class of peripheral nerve cells to do with sensation. It lost touch, but also his movements and position sense had got, is this unusual? I mean in your experience? I mean depends who we talk to, but I normally say that we know of about six in the world really who are like this. No one really in the world knew what proprioception did and what the effects of the loss of proprioception would be until it

Speaker 16:         35:23          and when they first met, Dr. Cole said to him, he said, how do you manage? How do you cope with this? Unbelievably, he was the first doctor to ask that question in told him that on own over

Speaker 3:          35:38          the 12 years he had figured out how to walk again and how to grasp a cup again and explained that he did this by carefully breaking down and then reassembling every single move he made started.

Speaker 17:         35:53          Um, this way. Um, I was laying in bed one day in hospital and I wanted to sit up and it just wouldn't happen. And then laying there in frustration, I just thought the whole process through and I broke it down into quite simple small movements and I lay flat. I checked where absolutely everything was before I started. And I then started with the head and folded and tucked my chin onto my chest as if to start the first part of the Co that I moved my arms slightly forward and I started to tighten some muscles in my tummy and around my back. And then I started to curl myself to sit in an upright position. And when I got there, I was damn down, euphoric and we fell out. The bed has studied movement in a weight that will in history has ever studied before though ballet Dodes said, do professor of neurology has ever had to study, move with the way he had as every day

Speaker 3:          36:46          because every day, every move that Ian makes, he has to consciously direct it as though Ian, we're two people, a puppeteer and a puppet. His mind is directing and his body is obeying and the strings of Ian's puppet instantly or his eyes are control. All my movement with my sight at, because he doesn't have this feedback information coming from his limbs back to his brain pro for septic feedback cause that's missing. Unless he looks directly at the limb, he wants to move, he can't move it. If I look away from from my hand, I lose all connection with it. Or what happens if, if it's dark or if the lights are out, we know it's, he can't afford darkness. If the lights go out accidentally us call caught a dangerous place to be our shoal over. He has not turned out the lights in the night in the last decades. Wow. To stay in the world. In motion. He must focus, always focus. He's like, he spent a long time just training with paper clip.

Speaker 16:         37:46          Yeah. I use them now occasionally. And I still don't like the little devils. Um, you know, I mean, well wait, when you, when you're manipulating the paper clip, what are you actually trying to figure out how to put it on the way these and, but he's, uh, I lost my fellow say if you could repeat that. Oh, okay. We should do Jess cause the headphones back on yet. Hang on. I'll do it. Great job. By the way, is he, is he able to put on, I mean, is this, you can tell me what's going on, but is he able to grab the headphones you're fucking on so he can grab the headphones and put them on? But because I'm putting the headphones over the top of my head, I can't see exactly where the headphones are in relation to the rest of me. Um, otherwise I would finally get this a lot quicker. Jonathan just puts them on. Right. And, uh, he likes to feel, so what I was asking was what were you doing with the paper clip? All tone. I was given paper clips as a, as an exercise to, to, to get my fingers to move again and to, to, to throttle them together and then to unclip them. Uh, very, very frustrating therapy but one has to admit that it is, it is a good one and it takes an awful lot of find extras movement to get paper clips together and apart again,

Speaker 3:          38:58          put the idea of breaking down every move you make into sub moves and sub sub moves and then relearning everything. It's exhausting. Very, very mentally tiring because it takes such total concentration. What if you were walking down

Speaker 16:         39:14          the street and suddenly a thought like a daydream pops up? John Jonathan has a very good memory of that and maybe a, that'd be good to compliment. Jonathan. Ian and I were walking through Oxford having done some groundbreaking experiments or whatever and he had suddenly stumbled and I'd never seen him, stubble ever before. And he was looking at pretty girl and he's thoughts had drifted from walking and from the concrete ahead of him to what he'd like to do to this girl while she, she was, uh, about 18, she had nut brown hair, lovely legs and miniskirt and it was a navy blue dress with white polka dots as a family program. But walks anyway to think about walking the floor, some merely the around the erotic sort of charge cost you beer. That sort of charged, but any distraction really took me away from my focus, which is, where is my left foot in relation to my right for and where am I balanced at the moment and how am I actually going through this process? At what stage am I in this movement? And to suddenly be attracted by that by a waft of perfume. And a pretty girl took all that concentration away. It can be taken away by the song of a bird or, or the sound of music drifting from somewhere. Uh, just on that day, it was a pretty girl

Speaker 3:          40:37          today. If you saw Ian on the street, you wouldn't be able to tell that he has this handicap. He has figured out how to live a very deliberate and in a way kind of a normal life. He drives a car, he works,

Speaker 16:         40:48          he drives that car. Yeah. My latest car, which is a very nice Mercedes. Um, I do drive the same speed as everybody else in all. [inaudible] I can react as quickly as anybody else. It's an automatic car and it has hand controls. That's the only favor to my disability really. But, um, I tend to do with my drive and what I do with in the way that I manage my life, which is I plan ahead.

Speaker 3:          41:15          I just want to [inaudible] my last question. Really. It's free and I guess is, is a, have you solved this problem as best you can? I mean, do you feel like you're one person or do you feel, uh, cut in half like a mind directing a body? Like like maybe two people or don't think about

Speaker 18:         41:34          it in the way that you've just just related that, um, I just think about, I want to get up, I want a cup of tea and this is the process I have to apply to do that. Yup. That's what, that's what we all do. I don't think stories like this involve heroes. They involve people who try their best under certain circumstances and have tested in a way that many of us are not. We can learn from that

Speaker 17:         42:02          Delta hand and you play it as you as best you can.

Speaker 6:          42:14          [inaudible]

Speaker 17:         42:15          Scott speaking, thanks to Ian Waterman and to neurologist Jonathan Cole. Dr. Cole wrote a very nice, lovely book about Ian Called Pride and daily marathon. He spoke to us together from the BBC studios in South Hampton. That was from,

Speaker 2:          42:33          Gosh, I really should read the book. You know. Hey, look, look at the chair. The chair is fine. Lunch cultish room doesn't get [inaudible]. It's a dog. You are listening to radio lab. Then you're from New York public radio, public radio,W and Y. C. O. N. N. P. R.

Speaker 8:          43:22          this is Radiolab. I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich and today on our program we're looking at uh, brains and bodies and how sometimes brains and bodies can get wildly out of sync. And let me offer one more flavor on this theme, which has to do with something that neuropsychologist Paul brox calls body Schema.

Speaker 2:          43:40          Body schemer is the brains sort of working model of the body in order for the brain to keep track of where you are, where everything is, it creates an inner representation of you. This is what he thinks a model very much in the virtual reality sense of where it thinks you are in space and where it thinks you are. The point is that we, although we think as a very solid distinction between where our bodies and and the world begins, in fact, the brain has to work quite hard to produce this kind of consistency of experience. And clearly it can go wrong.

Speaker 8:          44:18          This brings us to pilots. Okay. My name is Dan Folger. I spent 32 years in the Air Force, 25 that an active flying and this incidence occurred in July of 1952 at Luke air force base in Arizona.

Speaker 2:          44:36          Our story begins on a normal training day. It was really hot

Speaker 8:          44:40          in the cockpit flying down at low level, below 3000 feet. It was over a hundred degrees.

Speaker 2:          44:44          And Colonel Dan Full Jim was on his fifth run, flying in formation, doing a trading maneuver. He'd done it a million times before, but this time something happened. He pulled the plane up. Hard rolled out. Yeah.

Speaker 8:          44:56          The next thing I knew I was,

Speaker 6:          45:01          eh,

Speaker 8:          45:03          seem to be sitting up on the back of the airplane looking down into the cockpit.

Speaker 2:          45:08          Suddenly he was outside the plane, not inside

Speaker 5:          45:13          to see what was going on. I could see the ground. I could see it with another airplane. And um, and when he looked in the cockpit where he was supposed to be, he could see a pilot. I was watching myself not knowing it was me. What's going on here?

Speaker 6:          45:32          [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          45:32          I'm just going to watch this for a little while. So he just sat there on the wing of his own plane watching himself fly the plane and just all of a sudden that curtain snap.

Speaker 2:          45:45          So

Speaker 8:          45:47          it's not a dream. I'm actually, that's me in a cockpit and I'm flying the airplane again. But we began to, to realize it, Luke, that uh, in the eight weeks of training period that I was there, we lost nine pilots. Hey died. Yeah. Wow. And most of them for running into the ground are running into each other in the air and that sort of thing. And that's an awful lot of polished solutions just in training.

Speaker 2:          46:14          Okay. Fast forward many years army engineers are studying this problem and they figured out some stuff about it, not much. And then along comes this Guy Jim winter or Jim Winter, he is his name ma'am. At the Federal Aviation Administration. Your medical research program and he had a radical notion, if we're going to really understand this, I mean really get to the bottom of this. We have to induce this experience on purpose, make them go blank. Make them create the conditions that exist in a fighter jet on the ground, in a controlled environment so they can study this. His idea was let's put pilots in a centrifuge, this big a centrifuge and go to these things at the astronauts use. Got a 50 foot arm that

Speaker 19:         46:56          round and round and around and on the end of that 50 foot arm, this cockpit, a cockpit pretend cockpit mocked up to be exactly like what a fighter aircraft might be like with all the uh, controls. They screens the throttle. That's where the pilot sits and gets spun around real fast. I see. So when we put out a call for volunteers, I'm Tim says Deck Commander Says Tech. I met Dr Winter. He was one of the ones that, uh, got involved in his research, heroically volunteered to the centrifuge

Speaker 20:         47:30          and to deliberately knock himself out. Scared pilots. Don't do scared.

Speaker 6:          47:36          [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible].

Speaker 19:         47:40          This is a recording from the experiment. The task was to chase this little airplane. So I'd sit there and you'd follow it. And first couple maneuvers would be, you know, three gs g forces as the is when you're on a rollercoaster, five gs that force that pins you back in your seat. Seven gs, except really on a rollercoaster, you're only ever going to experience about two gs. And then nine gs.

Speaker 20:         48:03          Nothing like these guys at the high g forces

Speaker 21:         48:07          the skin on your face sags, your eyelids sag so low that you can't see out from under them. You end up tilt your head back to look out from under your own eyelids that are shaking down in front of your face. Meanwhile, yours,

Speaker 20:         48:17          you're tensing all your leg muscles in your abdominal muscles, in your arm muscles as hard as you

Speaker 19:         48:22          can. You learn to use your body to fight it. And what you do is you tend to every muscle from your toes here, calves

Speaker 21:         48:28          side out, push it all the way up, all the way up. Okay. And uh, do you take a breath? Right?

Speaker 20:         48:34          And you start to say the word Hook and you hold it for three seconds and then you finish it off by finishing the k of the hook. So these pilots, they sound like they're wrestling or fighting or shuffle hook. They're grunting and groaning and hook.

Speaker 6:          48:56          Hello,

Speaker 20:         48:57          making all these hook noises.

Speaker 6:          49:03          Select that

Speaker 20:         49:05          the most you have ever pulled was 12.4 gs. Just to give you a sense of what that might feel like for a pilot, like Tim says, doc who weighs about 200 pounds. Once he makes a 12.4 g turn, his body goes from 200 pounds to two almost 2,500 pounds. That's like over the weight of a car because of the pressure pushing down on it. Yeah, exactly. More crucially says when Ray, those g forces pull blood blood violently from the brain is pushed from the head down toward the feet and it pools and the abdomen and the lower extremities and when it pools down there, it can't get back up to the brain and that's when the problem starts. This doesn't sound very good. No, he Dr Winter, he documented a particular sequence that happens when blood is pulled from the brain. The first thing you lose his vision. Usually the first thing to go there, your eyes and you have what's called gray out or loss of peripheral vision and you start getting tunnel vision and then you go through blackout where you can see nothing. You lose your sight and then if you take the acceleration forces a little higher,

Speaker 6:          50:10          you're lose consciousness.

Speaker 20:         50:14          When I woke up, I remember just sitting there and I'm in this little white space. I actually had no idea who I was, who am I, where I was or what I was doing? Why am I doing? I'm sitting in this little white ball and I'm looking around and what is this all about? I hear this beeping. There's this white light beeping and then at that moment I realize that I'm in a little room and that I'm supposed to do something in that. One of the things I'm supposed to do is press that button. Should I press the button and at that moment I realized, holy macro on a pilot, I'm in an airplane and I'm not flying it, but I grabbed the controls and then just giant. I'm Tim Sestak, Holly macro. I'm Tim Sestak. I'm Tim Stash Jack. I'm a pilot. I'm flying in. The centrifuge all came back to me at once and I was okay.

Speaker 21:         51:10          Okay. Commando says tech, Dr. Bennett, how are you feeling again? I'm like, okay, go home time.

Speaker 20:         51:18          Over the course of 15 years when he tested about 500 pilots in the center view, she recorded their experiences, measured everything he could think of, and he found a few things. First at the average blackout lasted somewhere between 12 and 24 seconds, 24 second. Yeah, and wild blacked out. This is the interesting thing. Pilots experienced these strange little visions. Visions are given an example of the individual that, that lost consciousness had convulsive movements where he was moving his arms forward and back for about two or three seconds. When he came to we ask him what had happened. He said, uh, yeah, it was a nice warm day and I was out at the lake fishing.

Speaker 6:          52:00          Okay.

Speaker 20:         52:03          All of a sudden I could feel like a, I had a about a five pound bass on my line and he was tugging and each time he tugged, I haven't pulled back and then all of a sudden I was back in the centrifuge. I don't know what happened. These little dream, let's winter. He thinks this is the brain confused. It's cut off. Meaning think it from the brain's perspective. It's lost the body and yet the body is convulsing trying to get blood back up to the brain. The brain has no idea why it's convulsing. It just sees arms flailing about. It thinks, well, my arms are jerking back and forth. I must be best fishing. The things that are happening around you frequently get incorporated into those short streamlets. Here's one of his own. Turns out he has tested himself in the centrifuge many times.

Speaker 20:         52:47          A little dream up that I had. I was going down the aisle of a grocery store floating, if you will. I don't know that I was on a magic carpet, but I sure wasn't having to walk and I was just really motivated to try to pick up some ice cream. As I was going down the aisle and I was moving down through, then I could see the freezer. I knew the ice cream was over there and I just could not move my hand over to get it. The next thing I realized was I was trying to turn off the buzzer in the centrifuge with my hand and I could hear it. I could not move it and just momentarily I got the ability to have motor control return and I could turn it off.

Speaker 21:         53:35          I don't know where I am. God don't know where the hell I am. I thought I was at the grocery store by the way. The other thing is I, I couldn't control my arm to get the get the found off either. That's interesting.

Speaker 20:         53:51          This recording, you're listening to this from a day when Dr wintery blacked out five times in a row.

Speaker 21:         53:55          I don't remember anything on that one. Okay.

Speaker 20:         53:58          And after that fifth run, which you're about to hear, something weird happened.

Speaker 21:         54:02          Let you take a break. Just a few seconds. Can't you breath? I don't know about that one. I don't remember starting Allen last ride coming up. God, I don't know if you can take one more. I have thing cause I not ready yet. Sarah at the I'm hesitating cause I'm not quite ready yet. Okay. Just let me know whenever you get ready.

Speaker 6:          54:32          [inaudible]

Speaker 21:         54:33          well I didn't realize like you love flow through you Brian, my brother. Okay, I'm ready for that one. I did good Bob checklist that a station gas station is ready. Operator operator is ready. Medical medical is ready. Following, have you please. Hey, sort of final already has been activated. Are you ready guy? Yeah, I'm going up this time. Right? You, I remember going up on this one. Yes. Ron. Greg

Speaker 6:          55:25          [inaudible]. [inaudible]

Speaker 21:         55:36          yeah, I think that was enough.

Speaker 20:         55:39          At the end of that last run, doctor winner, he got off the centrifuge woozy and stumbled down the hall. I was really confused when, uh, when I got off the centrifuge and I was walking down the hall back to my laboratory and all of a sudden I began to realize that, uh, I was above and behind myself and I could see somebody who was myself walking down the hall and I said, Oh man, that's unusual. Pilots are generally not new age kind of guys, but at least 40 of them in wintery study did report what he just described having an out of body experience. We are still an even smaller sub sub group reported

Speaker 5:          56:24          the classic tunnel with light, light type thing. All Dr Whinnery can say is it that last sub sub group, they were the ones who were out the longest. They had the most intense blackouts. He's not ready to draw any conclusions, but he does suspect that the dream lists divisions of seeing yourself from above even the tunnel and white lights, it's all part of the same situation. The brain is just confused at having lost the body.

Speaker 6:          57:02          [inaudible] [inaudible] uh,
