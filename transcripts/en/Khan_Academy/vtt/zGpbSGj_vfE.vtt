00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.540
We're now equipped, I think,
with all of the tools to

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.780
convert back and forth between
polar and rectangular

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:06.280
coordinates.

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:08.470
And hopefully you have a
reasonable intuition.

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:11.380
I mean, they're both just
two ways of specifying a

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:12.950
point in two dimensions.

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:15.500
Cartesian, you kind of say how
far left and right you go--

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:16.300
that's the x-coordinate.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.000
And then the y-coordinate tells
you how far up and down you

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.120
go when you get to a point.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.070
When you do polar coordinates,
the angle tells you what

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.030
direction to point in, and then
the r, or you could view it as

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:29.330
the radius, tells you how far
to walk in that direction.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.580
Right?

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.765
So they're just two ways to
specify a point in space.

00:00:31.765 --> 00:00:35.720
And as we'll see some functions
are easier to specify, or

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.410
they're better described, in
polar coordinates, while other

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.710
functions are better described
in Cartesian coordinates.

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.570
But before we actually do
functions, let's do a couple

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.410
of quick problems using the
tools that we've built.

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.570
Let's say that we're given
the polar coordinate

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:58.090
4, 150 degrees, and we
wanted to convert this to

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.990
Cartesian coordinates.

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:01.420
So we want to
convert it to x, y.

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.510
Our first thing that we could
do is just to get an intuition

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:08.750
of where this even is.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.300
Right now I think you're
already at the point where if I

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.020
give you an x and y coordinate
you already have a

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.130
visualization of
where that shows up.

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.660
But polar might be relatively
new, so let's try to draw it.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.170
So for me, when I do polar
I like to think about

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.970
the angle first.

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.300
So 150 degrees.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.770
So if we start at the x-axis.

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:28.000
Let's see.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.430
That's 90 degrees.

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.910
All the way around
is 180 degrees.

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.750
So this will be 30 degrees
away from 180, so it's going

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.260
to be in this direction.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.550
Right?

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:42.830
This angle right here
is 150 degrees.

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.370
And I do find degrees easier
to visualize than radians.

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.040
That's, I think, just because
we use that in everyday life.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:54.090
And then we're saying, OK I've
pointed you in this direction.

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.330
How far should you go?

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.680
It says, well you go 4 units
in the 150 degree direction.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.740
So you go 4 units.

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:01.880
I don't know what that'll be.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.160
I don't want to do that.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.990
So I want to go 4 units
in that direction.

00:02:10.005 --> 00:02:12.220
Let me do it in a
different color.

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:19.030
I'm just assuming this is
one, two, three, four units.

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.250
So that's 4, 150 degrees.

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.050
So we want to convert this
to Cartesian coordinates.

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.070
And so we already have an
intuition that our x-coordinate

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.630
should be some negative number,
and our y-coordinate should

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:29.720
be some positive number.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:30.030
Right?

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.340
And let's see if
it all bears out.

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.690
So what are the tools that we
came up with in the last video?

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.540
Well, we came up with x is
equal to r cosine theta.

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.650
And that just fell
out of SOH-CAH-TOA.

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:43.990
Nothing fancy there.

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:49.610
And y is equal to r sine theta.

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.010
So this coordinate, x is
equal to r cosine theta.

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.390
So this is going to be-- let me
write it in a different color.

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.180
x is r-- so now we're dealing
with Cartesian coordinates--

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.300
r cosine theta.

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:01.280
So r is 4.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:07.370
So it's 4 cosine
of 150 degrees.

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:13.970
And then the y is r, which is
4, times sine of 150 degrees.

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.240
And now we can get
the calculator out.

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.070
OK.

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.530
So let's see.

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.890
What's the cosine of-- well,
I'll just write it out.

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:31.160
So 4 times the cosine of-- and
make sure your calculator

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.600
is in degree mode.

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.450
You don't want to make it think
you're saying 150 radians.

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.320
So it's minus 3.46.

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:43.930
So the x-coordinate
is minus 3.46.

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.286
And what is the y-coordinate?

00:03:46.286 --> 00:03:55.305
It's 4 times sine of 150
degrees, which is equal to 2.

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.090
And that makes sense, right?

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.940
I mean if we eyeball it,
that looks about right.

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.870
If we go one, two, three, a
little bit more than three,

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.420
that looks like minus 3.46.

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.120
And then we go up one, two.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.310
That looks like
about positive 2.

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:14.670
So our intuition was right.

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.050
You could either kind of orient
yourself into the 150 degree

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:20.950
direction and then march
forward in that direction, or

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.520
you could say I'm going to go
minus 3.46 to the

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.140
left and 2 up.

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:28.440
So we've just done a
transition from polar to

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:29.400
Cartesian coordinates.

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.390
Not too bad.

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:32.880
So now let's step it up a
little bit and actually convert

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.140
functions from Cartesian to
polar and polar to Cartesian,

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:38.970
and back and forth.

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:41.640
So I just did a random
web search for problems

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.440
and I found these.

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:48.770
The first one, they want us to
convert this, x squared plus y

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:53.260
squared is equal to 4,
to polar coordinates.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.770
Right?

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:55.670
And hopefully you have some
intuition already that

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:56.640
this is a circle.

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:56.940
Right?

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:58.850
And it's actually even more
obvious when you do it

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:59.600
in polar coordinates.

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.230
So what were the
toolkits we had built?

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:05.630
We had figured out that x
squared plus y squared

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:06.560
is equal to r squared.

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.490
That was just the
Pythagorean theorem.

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:16.430
We knew that the tangent of
theta was equal to the opposite

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:20.230
over the adjacent-- y over x.

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:26.380
And we also learned that y is
equal to r sine of theta, and

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:30.440
x is equal to r cosine theta.

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.780
And you can prove all these
just from SOH-CAH-TOA and

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:33.440
the Pythagorean theorem.

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:36.500
But if you had to memorize one
thing going into an exam on

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.490
polar coordinates it would
be these four equations.

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:39.790
Not that I'm a big fan.

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:41.590
I actually don't have
these memorized.

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:44.290
I always spent, literally,
the first 10 seconds of the

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:47.050
exam writing these down or
reproving them, and that

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:48.090
way you'll never forget it.

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:50.920
But anyway, let's convert
this to polar coordinates.

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:52.840
Well, you should already
see we have an x

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:54.600
squared plus y squared.

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.170
And we already say, well
x squared plus y squared

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:57.410
is equal to r squared.

00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:58.410
So we could just rewrite this.

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:01.770
This r squared is equal to 4.

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:06.400
And then you say, oh maybe r
is equal to plus or minus 2.

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:06.930
Right?

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:08.110
And it actually doesn't matter.

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:10.160
You could just say
r is equal to 2.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:10.890
And what does that mean?

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:15.100
Actually, I think it'll be
instructive to graph this one.

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:17.620
I wasn't planning on it,
but I think it'll be

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:18.310
neat to show you.

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:20.130
I mean r equals 2, that's
such a simple equation.

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:22.890
How can that be a circle?

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:24.080
Well what is a circle?

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.380
A circle is something
of constant radius

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:28.180
around some point.

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:28.540
Right?

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:30.110
So this is staying
a constant radius.

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:31.670
Radius is equal to 2.

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:36.470
So if we take a distance
of-- so this is one, two.

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:38.700
So it says no matter what
the angle is, right?

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:41.740
This function doesn't
even involve the angle.

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:42.840
It says the radius is constant.

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:44.280
It doesn't matter
what angle I have.

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:46.170
So if the angle is
0 the radius is 2.

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:48.130
If the angle is, I don't
know, 30 degrees the

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:49.280
radius is still 2.

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.490
If the angle is 60
degrees it's still 2.

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:53.870
So the radius is 2
no matter what.

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:55.310
And I should probably
use the circle tool.

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:56.550
So as we go around
it doesn't matter.

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:59.380
The radius is always
going to be 2.

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:01.410
This distance is always going
to be 2, no matter what

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:03.150
direction we're pointed in.

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:06.220
And to some degree, that's
the definition of a circle.

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:08.650
A circle, in polar coordinates,
is actually a lot

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:10.800
easier to write down.

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.380
Radius is equal to 2.

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:13.780
That's a circle.

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:14.880
Let's do the next one.

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:18.170
Actually, I'm going to erase
this because I want to

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:20.130
reuse this over here.

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:24.880
So let me just black
that stuff out.

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:25.245
OK.

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:30.390
And then here I go.

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:31.180
All right.

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:37.890
The next one they give us is
x squared plus y squared is

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:43.790
equal to 9 times y/x squared.

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:44.200
All righty.

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:46.660
If we do some pattern matching,
well x squared plus y squared

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:48.200
we know that's equal
to r squared.

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:53.700
So this is equal to r squared
is equal to 9 times--

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:54.710
let's see, y over x.

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:55.860
That looks suspicious.

00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:58.810
Tangent of theta
is equal to y/x.

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:00.500
So this is tangent of theta.

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:05.540
So 9 times tangent
of theta squared.

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:08.540
And maybe we want to take the
square root of both sides.

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:08.810
Right?

00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:11.030
So r is equal to-- remember, we
have to take the square root of

00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:12.395
both of these, because we're
taking the square root of

00:08:12.395 --> 00:08:13.270
the whole both sides.

00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:18.500
So it's r is equal to, we could
say plus or minus 2 tangent

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:21.000
of theta, but it actually
doesn't matter once again.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.410
And that happens a lot
in polar coordinates.

00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:29.290
Actually, let me show you what
a negative radius means, just

00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:31.950
so that you get the intuition
why in that previous example it

00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:33.930
didn't matter whether I took
the radius as minus

00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:35.830
2 or positive 2.

00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:38.160
So for any given angle-- I just
want to give you an intuition

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:42.680
of what a negative radius is--
if I give you a positive radius

00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:46.180
we're going to go in that
direction for this angle.

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:48.260
But if I give you a negative
radius we go in the

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:49.310
other direction.

00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:51.620
So this would be a positive
radius, and this would

00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:52.380
be a minus radius.

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:53.390
You just go backwards.

00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:55.580
You walk backwards
in that direction.

00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:58.720
So in that previous example we
could say, OK the radius is

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:01.170
equal to 2 no matter what.

00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:01.490
Right?

00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:02.910
So when you're angle is
in this direction your

00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:04.090
radius is equal to 2.

00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:06.710
Or you could say the radius is
always equal to negative 2.

00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:06.990
Right?

00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:08.610
When you're pointed in
this direction the radius

00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:10.800
is equal to minus 2.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.090
So it's always going
to be minus 2.

00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:14.270
But it ends up being the
same thing either way.

00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:16.600
And actually it turns out the
same thing for this equation,

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:19.240
so you could just say r is
equal to 3 tangent of theta.

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:20.910
If you're not sure, I guess
it doesn't hurt to put

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:23.020
the plus or minus there.

00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:23.990
Next one.

00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:26.220
Let me erase this one again.

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:27.570
Actually, I'm almost
out of time.

00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:30.210
Let me continue this
in the next video.
