00:00:00.412 --> 00:00:03.420
As JavaScript developers we frequently make use of closures which

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:05.550
are a concept many people find confusing.

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:08.000
Can you explain exactly how closures work?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.440
&gt;&gt; Sure. Put simply, every function should have access to all the variables from

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.470
all the scopes that surround it.

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:19.770
A closure is just any function that somehow remains available after those

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.690
outer scopes have returned.

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.580
Now that probably sounds at least a little confusing, but

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.340
as we look back at our code we're going to see specific examples of how that

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.020
plays out and how we can use closures in our program.
