00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:06.070
Let's have 1 molar of-- let
me pick a strong acid.

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:07.730
Let's say it's hydrochloric
acid.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:11.580
HCl.

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.810
And we know, of course, that
since it's a strong acid it

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:16.309
disassociates completely.

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.370
So HCl in an aqueous solution--
or a solution of

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:25.700
water-- disassociates completely
into hydrogen ions

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.660
in an aqueous solution, which
is really hydronium.

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.390
I've said that multiple times.

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.670
Plus your chlorine anion
in an aqueous solution.

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.300
So if you actually have a molar
of this, as soon as you

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.580
put it in the water, you really
have 1 molar of this.

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.120
So your hydrogen concentration
is really 1 molar.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.960
And of course we know, what's
the pH of that?

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.170
Well, the pH is just the minus
log base 10 of your hydrogen

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.270
concentration, which is 1.

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.760
Which is the minus log of 0.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.610
So minus 0, which
is equal to 0.

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.209
So your pH is going
to be equal to 0.

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:07.560
And let's say for use in the
later part of this, let's say

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.940
I have a liter of this.

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:11.110
Right.

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.290
This just tells me how many
moles per liter, and now I

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.680
just told you that
I have 1 liter.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.210
So you know that you
have 1 mole.

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.810
Let me make a little
chart here.

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.650
I'll make a little box here.

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:29.100
And let's make this
access right here.

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.050
This is going to be my pH.

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.800
And right when I take that first
measurement-- let's say

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:41.700
this is 0 here, this is 7,
and this is 14 up here.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.660
When I take that first
measurement, my solution of

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:52.270
hydrogen chloride, or
hydrochloric acid, has a pH 0.

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.170
Now, what I'm going to do is
I'm going to titrate this

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:57.530
aqueous solution of acid.

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.240
And titrate just means drop
something else into it in

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.650
controlled increments
to see what happens.

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.121
And what I'm doing here
is going to be

00:02:06.121 --> 00:02:07.800
an acid-base titration.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.199
I have an acid here, and what
I'm actually going to titrate

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:16.110
it with, or the reagent that
I'm going to add to it--

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.540
The reagent is essentially a
reactant that, when you view

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.400
it this way, that you're
adding to the solution.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.320
So it's the titrant.

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.600
So in this case, my solution
already has

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:25.825
hydrochloric acid in it.

00:02:25.825 --> 00:02:27.360
The pH is already 0.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.480
But what I'm going to
do is I'm going to

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.880
add a strong base.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.410
Let's say sodium hydroxide.

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.740
That's my favorite
strong base.

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.500
And let's say I have a solution
that I have prepared

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.230
ahead of time.

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.595
Let's say it's a 1
molar solution.

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.330
But I'm not going to add all
of it at the same time.

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:52.780
I'm going to add it
in increments of

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.300
a tenth of a liter.

00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:02.020
So this is 1 liter
that I've added.

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.150
And then this would
be 2 liters.

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.440
And so this would be
500 milliliters.

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.240
500 mL.

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.720
This is 1 liter.

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.000
This is 1.5 liters.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.130
This 2 liters.

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.740
And so on this axis, I'm going
to slowly add more and more of

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.420
this hydroxide.

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:25.670
So what's going to happen?

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.610
As I slowly add hydroxide, it's
going to increase the pH.

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.750
Why is it going to
increase the pH?

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:35.950
Because this OH.

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.130
Remember, hydroxide
is a strong base.

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:44.750
So the NaOH disassociates
completely

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.440
in an aqueous solution.

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.820
To OH minus plus
sodium cation.

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:52.370
Right?

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.900
Now if I'm adding this to this
stuff here, what do you

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.650
think's going to happen?

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.840
Well this stuff right here,
these OHs are just going to

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.960
sop up your hydrogens.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.430
So for the most part--
obviously, everything is

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.950
probabalistic.

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.380
And whenever we're dealing with
chemistry, there's always

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.715
some molecules that won't
completely react, and there

00:04:09.715 --> 00:04:12.230
will always be some
concentration of anything.

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.000
And that's why you actually
can never get to a 0

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.990
concentration of hydrogen, no
matter how much base you add.

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:20.570
Because there will always be
some hydrogen molecules that

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:23.365
are just hiding just perfectly,
or they're in

00:04:23.365 --> 00:04:24.870
perfect equilibrium so
they don't react.

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.720
But most of them will react.

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.110
But as I add more H, these
are going to disappear.

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.450
So my hydrogen concentration
is going to go down.

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:37.360
The pH is a negative log of
that, so your pH will go up.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.950
Your pH will go up slowly--
well, it will look slowly,

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.050
because it's a log chart,
so maybe it's doing

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:45.610
something like this.

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.230
Your pH concentration is going
to look something like-- as

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:49.060
you add more and more.

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:50.930
But you might say, oh that's
such a slow movement.

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:52.250
Why isn't it occurring faster.

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.560
But you have to think
about something.

00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:02.940
This right here, if this is a pH
of 1, this means-- so, at a

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:04.810
pH of 0, this means
your hydrogen

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:07.410
concentration is 1 molar.

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:11.130
At a pH of 1, this means your
hydrogen concentration is at

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:12.640
10 to the minus 1.

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.480
Which is 0.1 molar.

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:20.410
So even though on a log chart
it looks like you've made a

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:22.190
very small movement, you've
actually gone

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:23.640
by a factor of 10.

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:26.205
In terms of your reduction of
your hydrogen concentration.

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:34.360
You started off with 1 molar
of your hydrogen.

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.910
By the time you've added roughly
900 milliliters of

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:41.530
your solution, you probably
would have gotten

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:42.220
rid of most of it.

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:43.580
And obviously the denomenator's
changing,

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:46.270
because I'm actually
adding volume here.

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:46.600
Right?

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.220
Because I'm actually adding
some volume here.

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:50.120
So you would have to add them.

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:51.850
But you get the I
general idea.

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:55.380
That these actual molecules of
hydroxide are going to react

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:56.420
with these things.

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:59.370
They're going to essentially
turn into water and disappear

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:02.340
into the solution.

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:04.430
So these are going to
disappear with those

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.010
disappearing, for
the most part.

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:09.120
Which leads in an overall
reduction concentration of

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.080
your hydrogen ions, which
will lead to an

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.500
increase in your pH.

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:15.590
Until some point where you have
pretty much sopped up as

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:17.540
many of these things
as you can.

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:19.520
There will always be a few of
them, but you've sopped up as

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:20.780
many of them as you can.

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:27.310
And so any incremental hydroxide
you add will

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:30.950
actually go to build the
hydroxide concentration.

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:33.140
Where the hydroxide
concentration is going to be

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:35.690
greater than your hydrogen
concentration.

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:37.480
But even better than that,
there's going to be some point

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:40.780
where you've added just enough
of this that you have an equal

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:43.030
amount of this and this.

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:46.410
You have an equal amount of
hydroxide and hydrogen.

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:48.200
Right?

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:50.370
What happens, first of all, when
there's an equal amount

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:52.380
of hydroxide and hydrogen?

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:54.240
Well, then you're neutral.

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:55.320
Right?

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:58.390
If your hydroxide concentration
is equal to your

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:02.280
hydrogen concentration,
you're neutral.

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:03.320
This is just like water.

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:07.810
You're at a pH of 7.

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:11.010
So there's some point where your
hydroxide concentration

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:14.270
is equal to your hydrogen
concentration, and your pH is

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:15.730
going to be 7.

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:17.680
And then above that,
you're just adding

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:18.990
more and more hydroxide.

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:21.690
The hydroxide concentration is
overwhelming your hydrogen

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:22.630
concentration.

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:24.580
And so you're going to get
really, really basic.

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:27.040
And since this is a strong base,
you're eventually going

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:29.340
to get to a pH of 14.

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:31.490
Because you're essentially going
to have-- well, you're

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:32.400
not going to have 1 molar.

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:33.760
Let me erase that point.

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:38.320
You're going to have
half a molar of OHs

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:39.240
at the end of this.

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:41.830
So your graph is going to look
something like this.

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:49.850
Now, I mean, you're still
going to have hydrogen

00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:52.070
concentration, but it's going
to go really small.

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:55.450
It's going to get really,
really small.

00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:56.030
Now.

00:07:56.030 --> 00:08:00.330
What's interesting about what
just happened here?

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:07.570
At this point right here, your
OH is equal to your hydrogen.

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:13.460
And the way I think about it is
the great majority of your

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:17.210
moles of hydrogen were sopped
up at that point.

00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:20.980
So in order to stop up 1 mole of
hydrogen, you essentially,

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:23.880
for the most part-- and there's
always things that

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:25.740
don't get completely sopped up--
but you'll essentially

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:33.919
have to add 1 mole
of OH to sop up

00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:35.280
your 1 mole of hydrogen.

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:37.289
Remember, this is 1 molar and
you had 1 liter of it.

00:08:37.289 --> 00:08:41.650
So you had 1 mole of
hydrogen to sop up.

00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:44.700
So you need 1 mole of OH to sop
up, and how do you get 1

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:46.040
mole of OH?

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:49.130
Well, we said the concentration
of the solution

00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:51.110
was 1 molar.

00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:54.170
So once you put a liter in
there-- because that's 1 mole

00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:56.240
per liter-- once you put a liter
in there, you would have

00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:00.430
put 1 mole of hydroxide
cations in there

00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:01.390
to sop up the hydrogen.

00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:04.240
So this is the equivalence
point.

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:07.180
Where have essentially, you have
an equal amount and very

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:10.430
low concentrations of both
hydroxide and hydrogen.

00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:13.370
You've essentially sopped up all
of the hydrogen, but you

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:15.880
also have sopped up all
of the hydroxide that

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:17.170
you've added so far.

00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:19.660
After this point, any hydroxide
you add will

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:23.520
essentially contribute to
increasing the pH even more.

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:27.560
Or it'll kind of overwhelm your
hydrogen concentration.

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:28.760
Now what's interesting
about this?

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:31.510
In this example, I told you, oh,
I have hydrochloric acid

00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:33.870
and I gave you its concentration
ahead of time.

00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:35.070
But let's say I didn't
tell you that.

00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:37.730
Let's say it was some mystery
substance, and you just

00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:40.000
measured the mystery
substance's pH.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.970
At this point, you said
OK, it's pH is 0.

00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:47.560
And you titrated it with
this sodium hydroxide.

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:50.250
And you said, well, gee, when
I added 1 mole-- because you

00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:56.810
figured out at a liter of the
solution-- of hydroxide ions.

00:09:56.810 --> 00:10:00.010
At that point, I've essentially
eliminated all of

00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:03.990
the hydrogen ions that were
in my original solution.

00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:07.300
So I must have had 1 mole
of whatever acid

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:08.890
this was over here.

00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:11.620
So this would have told you that
my initial concentration

00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:18.680
was 1 mole of H plus.

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:21.450
And since we know it's easy to
see how much volume you have,

00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:22.180
you see I have a liter.

00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:23.850
So you say my original
concentration of

00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:25.730
this acid is 1 molar.

00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:28.490
And you could also know that
what you're dealing with is a

00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:29.740
strong acid.

00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:35.460
And I encourage you to watch the
next to do I do the same

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:37.390
thing with a weak acid.

00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:40.980
But because it's a strong acid
and a strong base reacting

00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:44.810
with each other, when you have
the same number moles of both,

00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:47.690
you get exactly to a pH of 7.

00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:50.620
They completely neutralize each
other, and you have a

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:52.350
completely neutral solution.

00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:56.510
If you had a strong base with a
weak acid, the strong base--

00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:58.840
once you have the same amount as
the weak acid, it would've

00:10:58.840 --> 00:10:59.770
neutralized it.

00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:01.090
But you would have also
had some of the

00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:03.370
conjugate weak base left.

00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:05.950
So you would have actually
ended up with a basic pH.

00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:07.060
And I'm going to do that
in the next video.

00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:12.440
But if you see that the
equivalence point occurs at a

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:15.850
pH of 7, you'd know that you
were titrating-- what you were

00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:19.150
dealing with was
a strong acid.

00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:21.780
Because it was completely
neutralized, not more than

00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:25.270
neutralized, by the
strong base.

00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:27.560
And if you want to eye-ball
where is equivalence point,

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:29.150
you look for the steepest
point in the graph.

00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:31.840
Because that's the point where
you're going from having a

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:35.090
majority of hydrogen versus
hydroxide, to having a

00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:37.120
majority of hydroxide
versus hydrogen.

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:39.660
So it creates this inflection
in the graph, and you just

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:41.240
would have to look
at this chart.

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:43.210
And say, I added a liter
of this solution.

00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:46.280
The concentration of this
solution is 1 mole per liter.

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:47.220
It's 1 molar.

00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:48.840
It has a molarity of 1.

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:51.870
So I must have added
1 mole of hydroxide

00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:52.820
to get to this point.

00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:55.480
So I must have neutralized
1 mole hydrogen.

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:58.140
So there must have been 1 mole
of hydrogen to begin with.

00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:04.330
And since I had 1 liter of
solution, I had 1 mole

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:06.100
hydrogen and 1 liter
of solution.

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:10.160
So my original molarity was 1.

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:12.160
Anyway, I don't want to
confuse you too much.

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:14.340
In the next video, I'm going to
try to do the same thing,

00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:16.880
but I'm going to do it
with a weak acid.
