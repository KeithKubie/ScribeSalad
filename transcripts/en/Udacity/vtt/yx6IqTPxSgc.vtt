00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.458
This last lesson before the midterm, sort of stands out on its own, and w're

00:00:04.458 --> 00:00:08.874
going to do a review section to make sure you've got a grasp on this complex new

00:00:08.874 --> 00:00:13.388
material that we covered. Just as we started out the course with building up our

00:00:13.388 --> 00:00:17.743
knowledge of sets of numbers, we're going to round up this section of the class

00:00:17.743 --> 00:00:22.224
by revisiting this and acknowledging how we've built off of it. As a review of

00:00:22.224 --> 00:00:27.108
everything that we've learned about sets of numbers, here is a blank version of

00:00:27.108 --> 00:00:31.997
the full world of numbers diagram. And I would like you to type the name of each

00:00:31.997 --> 00:00:34.683
set into the proper position on the chart.
