ALISTAIR POTT: Well,
like Mekka said,

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.800
thanks very much for coming
to the hangover shifters.

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.650
This has been dubbed by my team.

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:11.510
We really appreciate
it, and welcome.

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:15.496
So we're going to be
talking [AUDIO OUT] We're

00:00:15.496 --> 00:00:17.120
going to be talking
about making money,

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.790
or how to make money
on Google Play.

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:23.920
So Google Play is this
gigantic digital marketplace.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.810
Android has way over a billion
users, soon to be two billion--

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:28.110
even more users.

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.945
And Google Play is how those
users get software and content.

00:00:30.945 --> 00:00:32.820
So we actually-- we view
that as a very, very

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.092
important responsibility.

00:00:34.092 --> 00:00:35.925
And the way that we
make that possible is we

00:00:35.925 --> 00:00:37.940
built this marketplace platform.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.520
So that's how we get
all this to those users.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.416
And for marketplace,
you need transactions.

00:00:44.416 --> 00:00:45.790
And that's what
we three work on.

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:47.960
So we make the Google Play
Commerce platform happen.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.840
So basically, you can think of
our job is to make developers

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.220
like yourselves successful.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.660
We want everyone
to be successful

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.200
selling content and
software on Google Play.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.740
So I'm Alistair Pott.

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.832
I lead product for the Google
Play Commerce platform.

00:01:01.832 --> 00:01:03.290
I've been a retail
guy all my life.

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.720
I started off in South
Africa, where I grew up.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.290
More recently, at
Zappos.com, and at Amazon.

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.470
And I've been at Google
for like three years now,

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.497
and I absolutely love it.

00:01:13.497 --> 00:01:15.330
I'll let the other two
introduce themselves.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.100
MEKKA OKEREKE: Hi, everyone.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.250
My name is Mekka, and I'm
the Engineering Leader

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:19.827
for Google Play commerce.

00:01:19.827 --> 00:01:21.410
I've been at Google
about three years,

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:26.380
and before that I was at Amazon
also-- big retail commerce

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:27.200
nerd.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.600
There I built a little thing
called the Amazon app store.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.460
And before that I
was an app developer.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.339
I had a company that built
a lot of mobile apps.

00:01:36.339 --> 00:01:38.130
Probably the one that
you've heard of most,

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.390
is-- [? Zagat ?] to go.

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.674
So--

00:01:40.674 --> 00:01:41.840
TAMZIN TAYLOR: Hi, everyone.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.790
My name is Tamzin Taylor, and
I'm the Partner Development

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.740
Manager at Google Play.

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.650
My background is
all mobile content.

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.690
I've been building and making
money out of mobile products

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.467
for about 15 years.

00:01:55.467 --> 00:01:57.050
ALISTAIR POTT: Cool,
thanks very much.

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.140
So the Commerce platform, one
of our biggest strategic pillars

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:01.970
is Reach.

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.420
We have this vision that
every single person on Earth

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.380
should be able to transact
easily on Google Play.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.730
Basically, how do we bring this
gigantic, gigantic audience

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.610
or market to you,
the app developers.

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.110
We have a big team
working on this.

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.780
This team wakes up
every single morning,

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.696
they're out there right
now thinking about how

00:02:19.696 --> 00:02:21.904
we can achieve this vision.

00:02:21.904 --> 00:02:23.445
One of the best
things that we can do

00:02:23.445 --> 00:02:24.960
is support local
forms of payment.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.120
So we've got this
gigantic marketplace, way

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.674
over 140 countries, way over
a billion users potentially,

00:02:30.674 --> 00:02:32.090
and the fact of
the matter is many

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.048
of them just don't have
access to credit cards.

00:02:34.048 --> 00:02:36.090
So credit card support is great.

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.990
But it's just
nowhere near enough.

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:40.180
And so local forms of payment
is a huge deal for us.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.590
And we have a large team working
on this all around the world.

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.440
Very regularly we are
launching new forms

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.330
of payment in countries.

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:48.760
So what is an example there?

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.968
So direct carrier billing
is a great example of that.

00:02:50.968 --> 00:02:52.000
We call it DCB.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.654
Giving users the ability
to make purchases in apps,

00:02:54.654 --> 00:02:57.070
to buy those [? games ?] and
put it onto your carrier bill

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.080
is a huge, huge deal for us.

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.950
So the chart on
the right there is

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.405
showing what happened when
we launched direct carrier

00:03:03.405 --> 00:03:04.280
billing in Indonesia.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.321
We didn't even have all
the carriers in Indonesia

00:03:06.321 --> 00:03:07.120
at that time.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.940
But you can see buyer
growth was great,

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.937
we were always growing
our buyer base.

00:03:10.937 --> 00:03:13.270
But as soon as we launched a
local form of payment other

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:15.353
than cards in a country
where credit cards are not

00:03:15.353 --> 00:03:17.185
widely used, growth went up 4x.

00:03:17.185 --> 00:03:19.560
And this is something that we
see over and over and over.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.290
Recently in Turkey,
Saudi Arabia,

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.691
all sorts of countries where
credit card penetration is low,

00:03:25.691 --> 00:03:27.940
launching direct carrier
billing and other local forms

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.890
is a huge deal for the business.

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:32.670
I always think this
and I recommend

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.760
speak to your BD partner.

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.760
If there's a country that
you really care about,

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.090
like if you're
massive in Indonesia,

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:39.486
make sure that
you know when this

00:03:39.486 --> 00:03:40.860
happens so you
can take advantage

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.490
of those spikes in buyer growth.

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:45.840
So this DCB is important to us.

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.740
So I'm actually really,
really proud to say

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.490
that we fairly recently
crossed over the 100 carrier

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:51.677
partnerships barrier.

00:03:51.677 --> 00:03:53.510
And we actually just
carried right on going,

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.560
105 carrier partnerships around
the world in 41 countries.

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.724
And unbelievably, that
means more than 600

00:03:59.724 --> 00:04:01.890
million-- actually quite a
lot more than 600 million

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.870
active devices have access
to direct carrier billing.

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.150
So it's like a one tap or a few
tap to set up a form of payment

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:09.630
on Google Play.

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:10.720
This is a huge job.

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.760
We have a big team working with
carriers, setting up the deals,

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.760
maintaining the deals,
working around the world.

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.551
But as you can see from
the previous slide,

00:04:17.551 --> 00:04:18.810
this is totally worth it.

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.019
So the buyer of each team
is always out there adding

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.750
more direct carrier billing.

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.710
Another great form of payment
is the Play gift cards business.

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.172
So I always talk to
people about gift cards,

00:04:30.172 --> 00:04:31.630
it's like a magical
form of payment

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.610
because it gives the
users the ability

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.480
to use whatever form of payment
they like, the big one is cash.

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.600
So every single day,
every single moment

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.600
we have people walking into
like a 7-Eleven in Tokyo

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.207
or a corner store in
Indonesia, handing over cash

00:04:44.207 --> 00:04:46.040
and getting Play balance
back and then using

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.310
that in your apps.

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:49.420
It's a huge deal for us.

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:50.870
It's also a huge operation.

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:52.460
There's a physical
retail, there's

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.320
a lot of regulation
around this stuff.

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.250
We've got a big gift cards
team, and they do great work.

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:01.130
Over 500,000-- actually
way over 500,000 locations

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:03.020
that have Play gift
cards available to them.

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.870
So almost anywhere in Brazil you
can walk around and get a Play

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.890
gift card if you want.

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:12.070
So we constantly are
working to bring more reach.

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.400
We actually have a big team
that works on this stuff.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.060
They're working with banks,
they're working with carriers,

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.440
they are working with specific
local forms of payment

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:19.900
in all sorts of countries.

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.410
It's a huge job, but we
take it extremely seriously.

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:25.385
And we've got some
really cool local forms

00:05:25.385 --> 00:05:28.050
of payment coming in
India, in the Netherlands,

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.540
in Germany, and Korea, and in
other places in the future.

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:34.450
This is something that we care
deeply about, we invest deeply.

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:36.610
This is how we can bring
reach to yourselves

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:39.700
and the rest of the developers.

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:41.480
And then lastly, I
should say that one

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:42.970
of the great things you
get on the Google Play

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:45.140
platform or Commerce
platform is that we already

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:46.250
have a lot of buyers.

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:48.480
So somebody's gone along
and added a form of payment,

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:50.810
added their card,
and activated DCB,

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:54.060
become comfortable transacting
in apps on other apps.

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:55.810
And we've got a huge
base of these people.

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:58.000
And then they will become
much easier for you

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.910
to convert in your own apps.

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:02.300
So people who have
already made purchases

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:06.269
are correlated with a 40 times--
actually way over 40 times

00:06:06.269 --> 00:06:07.810
conversion rate
compared to those who

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:09.170
have not purchased in the past.

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:10.830
This is an extremely
attractive thing

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:12.122
for developers in the platform.

00:06:12.122 --> 00:06:13.705
The other thing that
ends up happening

00:06:13.705 --> 00:06:15.180
is we keep these buyers active.

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:17.320
Their card expires and
we make sure that they

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:18.410
renew their card.

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:20.080
Or they change carrier
and we get them

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.964
on the new carrier billing.

00:06:21.964 --> 00:06:23.880
So this is also a very
big deal for developers

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.342
such as yourself.

00:06:26.342 --> 00:06:27.550
But it's not all about reach.

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:29.510
Reach is fantastic,
but there's also

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:31.850
a lot of optimization and
iteration that goes into this.

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:33.220
I'm going to hand over
to my mate, Mekka,

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:35.660
and he's going to tell you
a little bit more about it.

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:37.280
MEKKA OKEREKE: Thanks Alistair.

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:41.140
So Alistair's right,
reach is fantastic.

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:43.900
So your customers
can buy your products

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:47.400
in over 145 different
countries around the world.

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:49.960
And coverage is great, too.

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:52.500
So coverage is talking
about the different forms

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:54.790
of payment, the different
ways that customers

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:56.960
can buy your products.

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.450
But reach and coverage
alone are not enough.

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:03.640
We want to optimize
the purchase experience

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:05.860
so that every one
of your customers

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:09.350
has the best possible purchase
experience wherever they

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:11.650
happen to be around the globe.

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:15.570
So Google Play is a
global commerce platform.

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:18.080
And that's something that I
want you to really internalize.

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:22.450
Most of the customers, most of
the opportunity for purchasing

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:24.200
your apps and your
product is going

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:27.010
to exist outside of the
country that your app is

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:28.450
being developed in.

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:31.410
So I wanted to talk a
little bit about the way

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:34.460
that we think
about optimization.

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:38.560
Now we think about it as
applied effort over time.

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:42.510
We are constantly
improving the platform.

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:45.870
So Google Play obviously is a
very widely distributed app--

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:47.320
over a billion users.

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:49.630
We push out new changes
and improvements

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:52.380
to the purchase flow
every single month.

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:54.710
Now our back-end systems, we
upgrade every single week.

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:58.470
Parts of our back-end system
are upgraded every single day.

00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:03.002
The system is always learning,
it's always improving.

00:08:03.002 --> 00:08:04.710
What that means for
you as a developer is

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:06.700
that's how we
fulfill the promise.

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:09.410
From last year to this
year our purchase flow

00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:13.610
is a little bit faster,
converts a little bit better,

00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:16.060
and is a little
bit more available.

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:19.160
And so this is what we do for
the platform on your behalf.

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:20.480
Writing code is fun.

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:24.590
Not writing code and getting
the same result-- also fun.

00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:26.010
Deleting code,
that's expert mode.

00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:30.310
But, you know, we'll
talk about that later.

00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:32.549
So I want to talk
about a little model

00:08:32.549 --> 00:08:36.030
that we use to think about
optimizing our purchase flow.

00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:39.120
And this works with your
applications as well.

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:42.315
Now we think about commerce,
obviously I love commerce,

00:08:42.315 --> 00:08:44.690
but there are other ways to
monetize in your applications

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:45.220
as well.

00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:48.370
This works for advertising,
this works for purchases

00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:49.902
even outside of commerce.

00:08:49.902 --> 00:08:51.110
But this is the model we use.

00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:54.620
We think about friction
and motivation.

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:58.950
Now motivation is anything
the gives your users incentive

00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:00.180
to make a purchase.

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:02.710
So maybe you have
a great content app

00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:05.060
and users want to
subscribe to see

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:08.470
that content, no "Game
of Thrones" spoilers.

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:10.520
And maybe you have
a great game, right.

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:13.500
And you have in-app items that
the user would like to purchase

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:15.715
to advance to the next level.

00:09:15.715 --> 00:09:18.090
All of these things
are motivation

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:20.690
that give the user incentive
to make a purchase.

00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:24.390
Now friction is
anything that can stop

00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:25.740
that purchase from happening.

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:27.739
In fact, friction is also
anything they can even

00:09:27.739 --> 00:09:30.040
slow that purchase down.

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:32.050
Now some friction
is really obvious,

00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:34.810
if the form of payment
that the user wants to use

00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:37.710
is not available, well then
they can't make that purchase.

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:40.550
That's why gift cards
are so important.

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:42.990
A little bit less subtle--
or a little bit more subtle

00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:46.060
is things like the number of
clicks or the number of screens

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:47.320
that a user has to go through.

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:49.130
And that would make
sense-- less clicks,

00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:51.980
fewer screens
improves conversion.

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:56.390
Now latency and network
connectivity errors.

00:09:56.390 --> 00:09:59.500
Again, thinking about a
global commerce platform.

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:01.850
These ones are really important.

00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:04.430
Now we're here in
Mountain View, inches

00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:06.410
away from Google headquarters.

00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:09.110
Our 4G coverage is awesome.

00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:12.840
And our Wi-Fi is
unlimited and unmetered.

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:15.920
This is just not the case
for most of your customers

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:17.720
around the globe.

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:21.020
So improvements in
latency and conversion

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:25.020
have a small impact here
in the developed world.

00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:28.250
But in countries
like Brazil, India,

00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:32.560
Indonesia has a huge
uplift just by making

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:39.289
your applications more resilient
to adverse network situations.

00:10:39.289 --> 00:10:41.330
Another even more subtle
one I want to talk about

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:42.930
is cognitive load.

00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:44.980
That's a fancy way
of saying how much

00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:48.340
do I have to think
before making a purchase.

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:50.630
The answer should be, not much.

00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:53.100
So things that interfere
with this, things

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:57.180
that increase cognitive load are
more information on the screen

00:10:57.180 --> 00:10:58.950
than is needed to
complete the purchase.

00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:01.760
We want to keep the screens
as simple as possible.

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:04.710
Yet we want the customer
to be fully informed

00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:05.970
when they make a purchase.

00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:09.250
Commerce is a
trust relationship.

00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:11.770
You give me money,
I give you stuff.

00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:15.020
And if that works out
well, we do this again.

00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:20.190
Commerce, to work well, is a
long-term trust relationship.

00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:23.200
So you want the user to have
the information to be informed.

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:25.200
But you don't want to
give them more information

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:26.030
than they need.

00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:29.600
And the way you solve
that is with good design,

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:31.200
design matters.

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:33.940
So what I mean is for the
UX designers out there,

00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:37.980
moving pixels around does
actually drive up revenue.

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:42.180
Now pricing-- pricing is
a huge form of friction

00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:43.880
that a lot of people
don't think about.

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:45.450
And this is another
one that I want

00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:46.600
you to take very seriously.

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:49.390
And we're going to talk
about this in detail later.

00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:52.540
I saw the Android Auto Maserati.

00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:55.000
I want a Maserati, who
doesn't want a Maserati.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.575
That price point is
causing me some friction.

00:11:57.575 --> 00:11:59.660
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:03.460
And so having items
priced at the right point

00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:05.520
really helps your
users to convert.

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:07.709
And we're going to go
into some examples,

00:12:07.709 --> 00:12:09.250
Tamzin is going to
help us with that.

00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:11.720
Pricing stuff is hard,
but Tamzin's amazing

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:15.280
so it will all work out.

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:18.115
Localizing the purchase
flow is something that we do

00:12:18.115 --> 00:12:20.200
and something that you
can do in your apps.

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:21.694
And it's easy to
say, well I don't

00:12:21.694 --> 00:12:23.360
know all the local
markets, I don't know

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:24.960
how to make my app work there.

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:27.160
But some things are
incredibly simple.

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:30.410
So something as simple as in the
United States, we'd like to buy

00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:32.010
stuff with credit cards.

00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:34.786
In some countries they like to
buy things with bank transfer.

00:12:34.786 --> 00:12:37.410
In other countries they like to
buy things on the carrier bill.

00:12:37.410 --> 00:12:41.740
So solving the friction point of
enabling customers to purchase,

00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:44.180
that problem is solved
in different ways

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:45.780
with different markets.

00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:49.050
Now that's looking at
location as one dimension.

00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:50.896
But there are many dimensions.

00:12:50.896 --> 00:12:52.270
Now everything
we've talked about

00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:53.720
so far-- we've talked
about the reach,

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:54.920
we've talked about the coverage.

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:56.560
These are all things
that we're doing.

00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:59.019
And it would be great if you
didn't have to do anything,

00:12:59.019 --> 00:13:00.310
and everything would just work.

00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:04.890
But this is-- the purchase
flow doesn't begin with Google,

00:13:04.890 --> 00:13:06.715
the motivation doesn't
begin with Google.

00:13:06.715 --> 00:13:08.725
It begins with your
apps and your customers.

00:13:08.725 --> 00:13:10.600
And there are some things
that you can really

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:12.200
be optimizing as well.

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:15.170
We're going to go into what
some of those examples are.

00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:19.120
And again, this is for
commerce in general.

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:21.290
These are commerce fundamentals.

00:13:21.290 --> 00:13:24.700
So I want to talk a little
bit about Rocket Internet.

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:28.510
Rocket Internet is a
global scale company

00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:31.340
and they have over
100 applications.

00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:34.460
One of their applications
is a food delivery app.

00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:38.220
And in this food delivery
app, they analyze their users.

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:40.540
They looked at 60
dimensions, location

00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:41.770
being just one of them.

00:13:41.770 --> 00:13:45.790
They also looked at
session length, cart size,

00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:49.030
what products the
customers were ordering.

00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:51.540
They used Google
Analytics to do this.

00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:55.200
They loaded it up using
BigQuery and analyzed it.

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:57.500
And what they saw was that
the users kind of broke down

00:13:57.500 --> 00:13:59.530
into five clusters.

00:13:59.530 --> 00:14:04.940
The top two clusters which
contain just 5% of their users,

00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:08.450
drove 40% of their
revenue, right.

00:14:08.450 --> 00:14:10.389
So you think Pareto principle.

00:14:10.389 --> 00:14:11.930
OK, well then let's
[INAUDIBLE] left.

00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:14.920
Let's just throw everyone on
the high-value users and kind

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:16.190
of focus there.

00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:18.610
Well not quite, right.

00:14:18.610 --> 00:14:22.800
The bottom 95%, again, that
represents your opportunity,

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:24.690
that represents
your growth, that's

00:14:24.690 --> 00:14:26.630
where your scale comes from.

00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:29.420
So what Rocket did, they
divided their team in half.

00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:31.790
Half of the team focused
on high-value users.

00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:34.105
And half of the team
focused on the users

00:14:34.105 --> 00:14:36.625
who are not yet high-value.

00:14:36.625 --> 00:14:38.000
And what they saw
is even looking

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.400
at the high-value users, they
saw something interesting.

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:44.910
They saw that these two
cohorts behave differently.

00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:47.589
You think your most engaged
users are your highest value

00:14:47.589 --> 00:14:49.380
ones, the ones with
the long session times,

00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:51.600
and that's not what they saw.

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:55.530
What they saw was that their
most high-value customers had

00:14:55.530 --> 00:14:57.810
extremely short session times.

00:14:57.810 --> 00:14:59.720
They were getting in,
they knew the app,

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:02.430
they ordered what they
want, and they got out.

00:15:02.430 --> 00:15:05.411
Now they had a very high
completion rate of orders,

00:15:05.411 --> 00:15:05.910
right.

00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:07.990
Hence why the revenue was high.

00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:10.130
But they weren't
spending long in the app.

00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:12.510
So optimizing for them
means something different.

00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:17.440
Optimizing for them means
adding a one-click checkout.

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:18.982
Making that fast
session even faster.

00:15:18.982 --> 00:15:21.398
I don't know if they're allowed
to say one-click checkout,

00:15:21.398 --> 00:15:23.600
maybe it's less than
two-click checkout.

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:24.997
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:24.997 --> 00:15:26.830
But so then they looked
at the other cohort,

00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:28.790
the other high-value
user cohort.

00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:31.340
And what they saw is
that these users were

00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:34.250
doing a lot of repeat ordering.

00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:36.840
And again, it was spending
a lot of time in the order

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:40.170
just making the same order
that they made last time.

00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:43.460
So optimizing for them
meant putting something,

00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:45.670
hey, here's that curry
bowl you ordered last week.

00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:48.180
Would you like to
order it again, right.

00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:51.310
So this is when you
think about optimizing,

00:15:51.310 --> 00:15:54.569
think about optimizing
along many dimensions.

00:15:54.569 --> 00:15:55.860
There's lots of different toys.

00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:58.084
In this case they used Google
Analytics and BigQuery.

00:15:58.084 --> 00:16:00.000
But there's lots of
different ways to do this.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.717
I saw some really amazing
stuff from FireBase,

00:16:02.717 --> 00:16:04.550
here at I/O. I don't
know if you guys caught

00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:06.260
some of those sessions.

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:08.730
The Play store, we have a
lot of really great tools.

00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:11.417
And some of you are building
some really interesting things

00:16:11.417 --> 00:16:13.500
that [INAUDIBLE] is doing
some interesting things.

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:15.840
So there's lots of
different ways to do this.

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:19.030
But the key point is
you should be doing it.

00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:22.920
And then looking at these users
who are not at the top 95%.

00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:25.640
What they saw was that
when they dug into this,

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:32.310
84% of those users were
falling off on the home screen.

00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:35.330
They weren't getting any
further than the home screen.

00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:36.650
Why?

00:16:36.650 --> 00:16:38.670
So they start digging into this.

00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:41.570
They started doing
UX experimentation.

00:16:41.570 --> 00:16:44.350
They started reducing
the amount of information

00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:47.010
you needed to provide
just to get started.

00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:49.020
Again, providing too
much data, that's

00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:50.250
another form of friction.

00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:51.750
I don't want to
fill out a form just

00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:55.260
so I can see if your food
delivery app is good, right.

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:57.710
So this is what I
want you all to be

00:16:57.710 --> 00:17:00.896
thinking about when you think
about optimizing your app.

00:17:00.896 --> 00:17:06.530
Now another example is
optimizing your business model,

00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:08.420
how do you monetize.

00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:10.380
The simple days used to
be, you got free apps

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:11.700
and then buy my paid app.

00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:13.240
That wasn't very great.

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:14.740
Then we're sort of
in today's world

00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:16.365
where it's, OK, you've
got the free app

00:17:16.365 --> 00:17:19.520
and you've got in-app items
or subscriptions, right.

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:22.040
But maybe you've ad supported.

00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:24.060
But I want you to start
thinking about using

00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:28.240
these different monetization
mechanisms in combination.

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:31.490
So Lovoo is a dating app.

00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:32.800
Is anyone familiar with Lovoo?

00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:33.758
Am I saying that right?

00:17:33.758 --> 00:17:34.280
Lovoo.

00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:34.779
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:34.779 --> 00:17:37.000
I always wonder if
I'm saying it right.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.530
And so there's really two
different types of dating apps.

00:17:39.530 --> 00:17:41.530
There is one's that are
really trying to develop

00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:42.730
long-term connections.

00:17:42.730 --> 00:17:45.850
And those tend to be
subscription-type apps.

00:17:45.850 --> 00:17:49.090
And then there are ones
that are much more casual.

00:17:49.090 --> 00:17:51.420
Swipe left, swipe right--
that kind of thing.

00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:54.200
And those tend to use
in-app billing items.

00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:57.520
So you can buy super likes or a
oh dear God, what have I done,

00:17:57.520 --> 00:17:58.600
no, no, no button.

00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:00.240
You know, this type of thing.

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:03.540
What Lovoo noticed was that
they could combine these two

00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:07.710
things to get a good result.
Because the casual daters were

00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:11.810
very unlikely to subscribe.

00:18:11.810 --> 00:18:15.240
So what they did was they
said, well let's offer both.

00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:16.840
Let's offer
subscription for people

00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:18.298
looking for a
long-term connection.

00:18:18.298 --> 00:18:20.390
And let's offer in-app
items for people

00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:21.592
looking for casual dating.

00:18:21.592 --> 00:18:24.050
And that worked, they were able
to monetize these customers

00:18:24.050 --> 00:18:25.940
that they weren't able
to monetize before.

00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:28.980
But something amazing happened.

00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:35.530
They noticed that over time
the casual daters, 10% of them

00:18:35.530 --> 00:18:41.030
subscribed and became higher RPU
long-term connection customers.

00:18:41.030 --> 00:18:43.570
This gives me hope.

00:18:43.570 --> 00:18:48.320
People, a lot of people really
do want long-term connection

00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:49.320
with other human beings.

00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:51.320
It's not all about
just hooking up, right.

00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:52.450
So this is interesting.

00:18:52.450 --> 00:18:55.140
Think about the
different models that you

00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:58.990
can use to monetize your app.

00:18:58.990 --> 00:19:03.350
Now we have a promotions
team on Google Play that

00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:07.350
builds promotions for customers,
things like discount codes,

00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:08.620
coupons, that kind of thing.

00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:14.930
The mission of that team is the
right offer for the right user

00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:18.590
in the right context at scale.

00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:23.070
Now Underwater apps, I don't
know what's going on here,

00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:27.090
but they get that
mission crystal clear.

00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:29.740
They have implemented
this in their own app.

00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:33.070
So what they do-- again,
they combine advertising

00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:35.145
and in-app purchase items.

00:19:35.145 --> 00:19:37.220
But what they do is
they used the player

00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:42.030
stats API to understand the
behavior of their users.

00:19:42.030 --> 00:19:45.020
Which users are they going to
monetize through advertising,

00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:46.690
which users are they
going to monetize

00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:48.500
through in-app purchasing.

00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:50.310
Again, in the old
days it used to be--

00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:53.740
get my free version it has
ads, get my paid version

00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:56.810
and-- or upgrade to
freemium it has no ads.

00:19:56.810 --> 00:20:00.630
But why make the user have to
make that conscious choice.

00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:03.870
Why raise the cognitive load,
how do you bring that down.

00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:06.930
We bring it down by
analyzing the data

00:20:06.930 --> 00:20:08.540
and making that
understand-- getting

00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:10.290
that understanding
without the user having

00:20:10.290 --> 00:20:11.550
to tell you anything.

00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:13.460
So they were able
to predict which

00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:17.750
users were likely to spend.

00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:19.340
Now what do they
do with this data?

00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:22.940
The users that were
likely to spend,

00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:26.530
they decided not to
show those users ads.

00:20:26.530 --> 00:20:30.790
And what they saw was that
revenue went up by 15%.

00:20:30.790 --> 00:20:33.374
Don't show ads to the customers
who are about to spend.

00:20:33.374 --> 00:20:35.540
And again, you don't have
to ask the users for this,

00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:38.010
you can understand this
from looking at the data.

00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:39.540
They also did something else.

00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:44.530
For the users that were unlikely
to ever spend in the app,

00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:48.100
normally for an in-app purchase
type app that might be a wash.

00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:51.900
What they decided was to
up the frequency of the ads

00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:54.720
so that when the users open the
ad, everything-- open the app,

00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:56.360
every time they saw one ad.

00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:58.482
Before it was something
less than one.

00:20:58.482 --> 00:20:59.940
What they were able
to see was they

00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:01.815
were able to increase
the advertising revenue

00:21:01.815 --> 00:21:05.310
from those users by 17%.

00:21:05.310 --> 00:21:06.340
That's pretty awesome.

00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:09.260
And again, the user doesn't
have to do anything.

00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:13.010
This is understanding your
data, understanding your users

00:21:13.010 --> 00:21:14.500
deeply, and segmenting.

00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:19.810
So we've talked a lot
about the different types

00:21:19.810 --> 00:21:21.400
of optimization.

00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:24.060
We've talked about
reach and coverage.

00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:28.320
But pricing optimization
is its own topic.

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:30.470
I think it's deserving
of its own section.

00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:32.226
So Tamzin is going
to help us with that.

00:21:32.226 --> 00:21:32.780
Thank you.

00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:33.988
TAMZIN TAYLOR: Thanks, Mekka.

00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:39.980
So Mekka and Alistair
have just taken us

00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:41.950
through all of the
things which we

00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:45.200
are doing to work so hard
to make our Play Commerce

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:47.410
platform make more
money for you.

00:21:47.410 --> 00:21:49.560
So what I'm going
to talk about is

00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:51.620
I'm going to give you some
examples of developers

00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:54.680
who have really taken
advantage of the platforms

00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:57.050
that we offer to
make more money.

00:21:57.050 --> 00:21:58.780
In the next 10
minutes or so, I'll

00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:00.810
take you through some
examples of developers

00:22:00.810 --> 00:22:05.170
who use creativity,
they've used localization,

00:22:05.170 --> 00:22:07.810
and more importantly
used experimentation

00:22:07.810 --> 00:22:11.490
to increase revenue
and conversion.

00:22:11.490 --> 00:22:16.306
So Scopely is a fantastic
American games application.

00:22:16.306 --> 00:22:18.180
I know there's someone
in the audience today,

00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:20.870
so if you have any questions
you can hunt her down.

00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:25.550
Scopely has over 50 million
downloads worldwide.

00:22:25.550 --> 00:22:28.227
And they are a role-playing
and strategy game.

00:22:28.227 --> 00:22:30.060
Their recent games you
can see in the screen

00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:32.170
is "The Walking Dead".

00:22:32.170 --> 00:22:35.610
Now traditionally, RPG and
strategy games-- and I'm

00:22:35.610 --> 00:22:37.230
sure I don't need
to tell you this,

00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:39.500
I'm sure you people
know-- monetize

00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:41.810
through e-net purchasing.

00:22:41.810 --> 00:22:43.840
But Scopely had a challenge.

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:47.630
How can they increase
retention and new users.

00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:50.640
So why is this
important for Scopely?

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:52.950
Well when you think about
an RPG strategy game,

00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:56.660
it's really important to build
an ecosystem of players, right.

00:22:56.660 --> 00:22:59.620
So that you can create
a team and battle it out

00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:01.540
against each other.

00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:04.124
Who here plays RPG games?

00:23:04.124 --> 00:23:05.540
I would expect it
from you Philip.

00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:06.570
Good, yes.

00:23:06.570 --> 00:23:07.590
Excellent.

00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:11.220
So how do they approach
this challenge?

00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:13.550
Well, because they are great
users of the Google Play

00:23:13.550 --> 00:23:16.630
platform, they came up with
an innovative monetization

00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:18.090
technique.

00:23:18.090 --> 00:23:21.320
They introduced a 30-day pass.

00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:24.180
OK, so the really great
thing about this pass

00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:27.800
was when you downloaded
it, when you bought it,

00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:31.530
you got an instant 270 coins.

00:23:31.530 --> 00:23:33.050
OK, so what.

00:23:33.050 --> 00:23:35.416
But then, here is the kicker.

00:23:35.416 --> 00:23:38.820
Every time you came back into
the game, on a daily basis,

00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:43.910
within that 30-day period you
got an additional 70 coins.

00:23:43.910 --> 00:23:47.300
So in effect, what they're
doing is incentivizing users

00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:52.180
to come back and play the
game and grow that ecosystem.

00:23:52.180 --> 00:23:55.230
So they combined subscription
with in-app purchases

00:23:55.230 --> 00:23:57.881
to really grow retention.

00:23:57.881 --> 00:23:59.380
But that's not all,
what they found,

00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:01.400
which was really
surprising to them,

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:06.920
was that their new users and
non-paying users increased.

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:10.040
What they saw was that
1/3 of all their purchases

00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:13.360
of this pack were
brand new users.

00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:17.030
And 2/3 of those were
non-payers-- long-term

00:24:17.030 --> 00:24:18.670
non-payers.

00:24:18.670 --> 00:24:22.750
Now did anyone see
Mateo's talk on Wednesday?

00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:24.950
OK, Philip again, good.

00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:27.220
So I'd encourage you to have
a look at that Livestream

00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:28.200
when you go back home.

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:31.392
But he goes into more
detail about using data

00:24:31.392 --> 00:24:32.850
to really understand
your audience.

00:24:32.850 --> 00:24:36.230
But in game language, what
I've been told by Scopely,

00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:38.310
is that if a user doesn't
actually spend money

00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:40.610
in between the first
one and seven days,

00:24:40.610 --> 00:24:43.480
or really one in three, they're
highly unlikely to ever spend

00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:45.077
any money.

00:24:45.077 --> 00:24:46.660
Now the name of the
game here, I think

00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:49.260
the presentation's called "How
to Make money on Google Play",

00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:51.940
so Scopely is a great example
because what they have

00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:56.000
effectively done is unlock
these long-term non-paying base

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:00.660
of users to create
a whole new market.

00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:04.837
Now unlocking new users
and long-term non-spenders

00:25:04.837 --> 00:25:05.920
is important for everyone.

00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:07.640
Wouldn't you agree?

00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:10.170
Yeah, everyone wants
more money, more payers.

00:25:10.170 --> 00:25:14.095
And its normal- its most
important in emerging markets.

00:25:14.095 --> 00:25:16.946
Who here is from
an emerging market?

00:25:16.946 --> 00:25:18.590
A few people, excellent.

00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:22.350
Yeah, I'm from an emerging
market as well, I'm Australian.

00:25:22.350 --> 00:25:22.910
OK.

00:25:22.910 --> 00:25:25.602
So it is emerging.

00:25:25.602 --> 00:25:28.010
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:28.010 --> 00:25:29.440
Just no one knows about it yet.

00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:35.170
So Divmob is an example
of one of our partners

00:25:35.170 --> 00:25:39.830
who really took advantage of our
new lower minimum price floors

00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:42.580
that we launched
earlier this year.

00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:44.790
Now as I mentioned and
Mekka mentioned and Alistair

00:25:44.790 --> 00:25:46.623
mentioned, we're working
really, really hard

00:25:46.623 --> 00:25:48.760
to increase more forms of
payment in more countries

00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:50.326
so that people can buy from you.

00:25:50.326 --> 00:25:52.700
We think it's really important,
because we want to unlock

00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:56.300
all these great users for you.

00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:59.610
So Divmob is a great company,
they're based in Vietnam.

00:25:59.610 --> 00:26:02.550
So no one knows
more than they do,

00:26:02.550 --> 00:26:05.810
how people in emerging markets
have different abilities

00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:07.530
to pay.

00:26:07.530 --> 00:26:09.960
And they're a huge company.

00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:11.350
They've recently,
I think they've

00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:13.470
had about 40 million
downloads, and they've just

00:26:13.470 --> 00:26:16.380
launched their game
"Epic Heroes War",

00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:21.440
which just got nominated Top
Developer and Editor's Choice.

00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:23.450
So with all this success,
you think fantastic,

00:26:23.450 --> 00:26:24.830
they're doing so well.

00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:27.460
Well in fact, what
they saw was that they

00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:30.040
had all these users
in emerging markets,

00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:33.690
they just weren't buying,
they weren't paying.

00:26:33.690 --> 00:26:36.010
And if you think
about it, before we

00:26:36.010 --> 00:26:38.740
made the change on the
minimum price floor,

00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:42.470
it was $0.99 American.

00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:47.630
Now if anyone is from Vietnam
here, $0.99 I checked it today

00:26:47.630 --> 00:26:51.440
is 22,000 dong, that's
the Vietnamese currency.

00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:55.440
Now for 22,000 dong, you can
get a really, really tasty lunch

00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:57.924
in Vietnam.

00:26:57.924 --> 00:26:59.590
How much would your
lunch cost you today

00:26:59.590 --> 00:27:02.360
if you had to pay for it?

00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:03.100
$8.

00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:04.852
$10.

00:27:04.852 --> 00:27:06.870
Is that, does that
sound like something

00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:09.950
you'd pay as a minimum
price to play a game?

00:27:09.950 --> 00:27:13.810
So put it in that context.

00:27:13.810 --> 00:27:16.000
Now Divmob were
desperate to start

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.410
testing because they had
the data that backed up

00:27:18.410 --> 00:27:22.710
their hypothesis, that once
you've got someone just buying

00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:24.730
something, just
paying something,

00:27:24.730 --> 00:27:26.400
you could actually
grow them, grow

00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:29.590
their RPU through cross-selling,
upgrading the game,

00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:32.400
and doing more of
these kinds of things.

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:34.880
So as soon as we
changed the system

00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:38.310
and allowed them to
price lower than $0.99.

00:27:38.310 --> 00:27:42.590
They start experimenting
Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia

00:27:42.590 --> 00:27:46.100
Philippines and the
results were outstanding.

00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:50.190
They created an introductory
pass at the minimum floor,

00:27:50.190 --> 00:27:54.780
and they saw a 300% increase
in paid transactions.

00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:56.440
300% increase.

00:27:56.440 --> 00:28:00.900
And best yet, they saw that
their base of paying users

00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:02.360
tripled.

00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:04.960
And that was after
the blip of promotion.

00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:09.119
So we're talking about
consistent result. Furthermore,

00:28:09.119 --> 00:28:11.410
who are all these new users
who are pretty happy to now

00:28:11.410 --> 00:28:14.220
be able to get
into the game, they

00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:17.660
saw a 17% increase in retention.

00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:22.270
So retention, monetization,
all goes together.

00:28:22.270 --> 00:28:24.490
And the best part is
that if you fast forward

00:28:24.490 --> 00:28:30.180
a couple of months, six out
of 10 of their top transaction

00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:32.680
markets by volume
of transactions

00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:37.040
are now these sub-dollar
price countries.

00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:39.140
So what this has
done is really open

00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:42.630
up a huge new
market for them, one

00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:45.740
which weren't paying before.

00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:48.190
Now another fantastic
company, we love very much

00:28:48.190 --> 00:28:52.490
and is in the audience
today, is Animoca.

00:28:52.490 --> 00:28:55.100
So Animoca also
were very, very keen

00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:57.410
to test sub-dollar pricing
because they again,

00:28:57.410 --> 00:28:59.900
they also knew they had all
these customers in emerging

00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:03.460
markets who weren't paying, and
this is a fantastic opportunity

00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:08.420
to try and move them
along the RPU ladder.

00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:13.040
Now Divmob had over 400 apps
live and over 430 million

00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:14.610
downloads to date.

00:29:14.610 --> 00:29:18.422
So they know something
about testing and pricing.

00:29:18.422 --> 00:29:20.130
Divmob took a different
approach-- sorry,

00:29:20.130 --> 00:29:21.504
Animoca took a
different approach

00:29:21.504 --> 00:29:23.760
and created sachet pricing.

00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:25.880
Now with these sachet
prices you could

00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:30.370
get 100 diamonds and 5,000 coins
for the lowest minimum price

00:29:30.370 --> 00:29:31.930
in that country.

00:29:31.930 --> 00:29:34.930
And the way they structured
it was quite interesting.

00:29:34.930 --> 00:29:36.285
This wasn't a regular price.

00:29:36.285 --> 00:29:38.607
It wasn't a regular SKU.

00:29:38.607 --> 00:29:40.190
It was actually a
promotional SKU that

00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:42.110
was targeted to these users.

00:29:42.110 --> 00:29:44.880
And the way they promoted it
was through native banners

00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:45.680
inside the app.

00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:49.350
So native billboards
and posters.

00:29:49.350 --> 00:29:51.980
And they were very
happy with the results.

00:29:51.980 --> 00:29:55.620
They saw that 90% of all
buyers of the sachet prices

00:29:55.620 --> 00:29:58.270
were absolutely new buyers.

00:29:58.270 --> 00:30:01.530
And better yet, as
you can confirm,

00:30:01.530 --> 00:30:06.700
50% of all of those buyers went
on to become repeat purchasers.

00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:09.710
And let me be clear, they
weren't repeatedly buying

00:30:09.710 --> 00:30:11.320
the cheap option,
they were repeatedly

00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:13.472
buying the full priced items.

00:30:13.472 --> 00:30:15.180
So you can see that
what's happening here

00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:17.138
is you're getting new
payers in and you're just

00:30:17.138 --> 00:30:21.400
taking them on the RPU journey
to increase their value.

00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:25.810
So this really has opened up new
markets, increased retention,

00:30:25.810 --> 00:30:27.500
and increased revenue
to these partners.

00:30:30.250 --> 00:30:33.410
Now using minimum
prices can really

00:30:33.410 --> 00:30:35.240
help in emerging markets.

00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:38.910
But obviously, you've also got
a mature markets to target,

00:30:38.910 --> 00:30:40.320
right.

00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:42.780
So SGN is one example
of a games company

00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:44.180
you might be familiar with.

00:30:44.180 --> 00:30:47.170
They have over 700 million
downloads across the world.

00:30:47.170 --> 00:30:50.100
And they're responsible
for the franchises Juice

00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:53.430
Jam, Cookie Jam, and Panda Pop.

00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:55.770
They really thought that
localizing pricing could really

00:30:55.770 --> 00:30:58.000
have a big impact
in some markets.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.000
So they took their top
markets and they used

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.380
the economists Big Mac Index.

00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:06.290
And then they
rounded those prices

00:31:06.290 --> 00:31:09.350
to the user's preferred
country price format.

00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:10.790
Now let me break that down.

00:31:10.790 --> 00:31:13.731
So who here knows about
the Big Mac Index?

00:31:13.731 --> 00:31:14.230
Cool.

00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:17.140
OK, for those of you who
may be less familiar,

00:31:17.140 --> 00:31:22.295
the Big Mac Index is basically
a-- it's a bit of analysis that

00:31:22.295 --> 00:31:24.860
The Economist newspaper
has done, where--

00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:26.500
Thank you very much.

00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:29.280
And what it does is it shows
you the comparative price

00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:33.770
to the McDonald's hamburger
from America to say Vietnam.

00:31:33.770 --> 00:31:36.320
So you can really get a sense
of-- because Mc is you know,

00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:38.110
they're pretty smart
about these things.

00:31:38.110 --> 00:31:39.985
You can get a sense of
what the prices should

00:31:39.985 --> 00:31:41.520
be in that market.

00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:45.110
Now when we talk about
price formats, what

00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:49.250
we mean is that in some
markets like Korea and Japan,

00:31:49.250 --> 00:31:50.940
they prefer whole
rounded numbers.

00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:55.980
So instead of 653
yen, they prefer 700.

00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:59.170
So rounded figures.

00:31:59.170 --> 00:32:02.320
Now they tested in-- as
I said, their top markets

00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:04.250
and what they saw was
quite interesting.

00:32:04.250 --> 00:32:07.480
They saw that in some markets
like Italy and Switzerland.

00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:09.285
RPU increased as much as 78%.

00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:14.710
In other markets they saw
a neutral revenue impact

00:32:14.710 --> 00:32:18.270
such as Korea and Norway.

00:32:18.270 --> 00:32:21.060
But above all, across all of
the countries they tested in,

00:32:21.060 --> 00:32:24.146
they saw a 30% increase in ARPU.

00:32:24.146 --> 00:32:25.520
They were really
happy with this,

00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:28.260
because they kept wanting
to do more testing.

00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:30.730
And as a result they've
rolled these prices out

00:32:30.730 --> 00:32:33.490
to all of their apps and games.

00:32:33.490 --> 00:32:37.425
Now the lesson here is that
a 10% increase or decrease

00:32:37.425 --> 00:32:40.982
in a certain country is not
going to work for everyone.

00:32:40.982 --> 00:32:42.440
The lesson here is
that we want you

00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:45.520
to test your prices in
these different markets,

00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:48.850
and see what works for your
customers in those markets.

00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:54.670
OK, so we've talked
about, we've talked

00:32:54.670 --> 00:32:56.680
about games a lot haven't we.

00:32:56.680 --> 00:33:03.479
Talked about Scopely,
Divmob, Animoca, SGN.

00:33:03.479 --> 00:33:05.020
But it's not just
the games companies

00:33:05.020 --> 00:33:07.790
who are leading the
innovation in pricing.

00:33:07.790 --> 00:33:11.220
One example of a great
app company is Memrise.

00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:14.890
Memrise are a leading
language learning application.

00:33:14.890 --> 00:33:16.640
The nature of their
content, obviously,

00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:19.364
learning lots of languages
is that their a global app.

00:33:19.364 --> 00:33:21.280
And they have a very
large proportion of users

00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:23.580
from emerging markets.

00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:24.900
Now they're a young company.

00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:28.010
So they only actually launched
price propositions back

00:33:28.010 --> 00:33:29.610
in July 2015.

00:33:29.610 --> 00:33:32.580
They just launched
monthly and annual passes.

00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:36.580
So in August they decided
they'd try localizing prices.

00:33:36.580 --> 00:33:39.530
They used the BMI, the
Big Mac Index again,

00:33:39.530 --> 00:33:42.820
and they saw reductions between
10% and 80% on their prices

00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:44.580
depending on the country.

00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:46.290
What they found was
a really good impacts

00:33:46.290 --> 00:33:52.650
in countries like Egypt, India,
Mexico, Ukraine, Saudi Arabia.

00:33:52.650 --> 00:33:55.115
Above all they saw 46%
in new subscribers.

00:33:58.200 --> 00:33:59.950
Now we've talked a
little about localizing

00:33:59.950 --> 00:34:03.690
prices, which is great.

00:34:03.690 --> 00:34:06.250
But to back all this up,
what's really important

00:34:06.250 --> 00:34:09.230
is to have an
experimentation mindset.

00:34:09.230 --> 00:34:12.050
So I'm going to take you through
a couple examples of partners

00:34:12.050 --> 00:34:14.380
who do this extremely well.

00:34:14.380 --> 00:34:15.880
They've really
thought long and hard

00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:20.010
about the way they present
the price, what the price is,

00:34:20.010 --> 00:34:21.800
and then how it's formatted.

00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:24.499
Because the key here is
about-- has anyone heard

00:34:24.499 --> 00:34:26.219
about psychological pricing.

00:34:26.219 --> 00:34:26.719
OK.

00:34:26.719 --> 00:34:31.100
So basically, if anyone's been
to a restaurant on a date,

00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:32.714
you don't choose
the cheapest wine,

00:34:32.714 --> 00:34:34.731
you choose the
second cheapest wine.

00:34:34.731 --> 00:34:36.886
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:36.886 --> 00:34:39.007
Shh, don't tell anyone.

00:34:39.007 --> 00:34:40.590
And so this is the
idea, that you want

00:34:40.590 --> 00:34:42.100
to create this idea of value.

00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:44.800
You want to create a reference
point in the user's mind.

00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:47.444
So they go, well I could
get that lower priced one,

00:34:47.444 --> 00:34:49.860
and there's that expensive
one, but that one in the middle

00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:50.754
looks really good.

00:34:50.754 --> 00:34:53.170
And so this is the kind of
thing we're talking about here.

00:34:53.170 --> 00:34:57.470
Now Peak is an excellent app.

00:34:57.470 --> 00:35:00.460
They are global leaders
in brain training.

00:35:00.460 --> 00:35:03.970
And they know that they need
to really listen to their users

00:35:03.970 --> 00:35:06.120
to continue to test and
iterate to stay ahead

00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:07.984
of the competition.

00:35:07.984 --> 00:35:10.150
So what they did was they
tested two different value

00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:11.570
propositions to
see how they would

00:35:11.570 --> 00:35:14.160
impact conversion and revenue.

00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:16.597
The first they tested
was how can they--

00:35:16.597 --> 00:35:18.430
similar to the ones we
talked about earlier,

00:35:18.430 --> 00:35:22.660
how can they actually get
non-payers to start paying.

00:35:22.660 --> 00:35:25.860
In this instance they ran
an A/B test where they said,

00:35:25.860 --> 00:35:28.870
what would happen if when
the user gets to the point

00:35:28.870 --> 00:35:32.470
where they hit subscribe,
instead they go uh,

00:35:32.470 --> 00:35:34.750
and they back out
and they cancel.

00:35:34.750 --> 00:35:37.950
So what Peak did was
present them a screen that

00:35:37.950 --> 00:35:44.030
said, oh, before you go we'll
give you a 20% discount if you

00:35:44.030 --> 00:35:46.450
subscribe today.

00:35:46.450 --> 00:35:50.670
This actually resulted in a 25%
increase in those people who

00:35:50.670 --> 00:35:53.820
saw the screen subscribing.

00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:55.540
So never say never.

00:35:55.540 --> 00:35:59.360
The second thing they tested
was how to increase RPU.

00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:01.250
As I mentioned, or
maybe I didn't mention,

00:36:01.250 --> 00:36:03.930
they had a monthly and
annual subscription.

00:36:03.930 --> 00:36:06.259
Well they wanted to test
was a lifetime subscription.

00:36:06.259 --> 00:36:08.550
So you know what I just said
about creating a reference

00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:12.520
point in people's mind--
in that sense of value.

00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:14.460
The lifetime subscription
was three times

00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:16.890
the price of the
annual subscription.

00:36:16.890 --> 00:36:18.640
But if you think about
the kind of content

00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:21.430
it is, people have an
altruistic view that they're

00:36:21.430 --> 00:36:22.960
going to really
improve their brain,

00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:25.250
they're going to smash it out.

00:36:25.250 --> 00:36:29.320
Well they found was that
10% now of all subscribers,

00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:31.110
are lifetime subscribers.

00:36:31.110 --> 00:36:32.420
And here's the kicker.

00:36:35.050 --> 00:36:36.790
I'm sure for you
as app developers,

00:36:36.790 --> 00:36:38.800
cash flow is really important.

00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:40.890
Having this lifetime
subscription

00:36:40.890 --> 00:36:45.030
has increased the return on
acquisition cost by 30%--

00:36:45.030 --> 00:36:47.640
it's coming in at 30% faster,
because you're getting

00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:49.710
more cash flow in quicker.

00:36:49.710 --> 00:36:53.846
So consider things like
this when you're pricing.

00:36:53.846 --> 00:36:55.720
Memrise have also done
some interesting stuff

00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:58.190
around psychological pricing.

00:36:58.190 --> 00:36:59.690
If anyone knows we
actually launched

00:36:59.690 --> 00:37:02.904
quarterly subscriptions
in September last year.

00:37:02.904 --> 00:37:04.740
Yeah!

00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:06.310
I was very excited.

00:37:06.310 --> 00:37:09.500
So Memrise already had monthly
and annual subscriptions.

00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:11.670
And they were very
keen to test quarterly.

00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:14.910
Again, learning a language
is an altruistic-- I really

00:37:14.910 --> 00:37:19.140
want to do it, it's a
self-fulfilling enjoyable task.

00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:22.299
So what they found was
that-- well first of all,

00:37:22.299 --> 00:37:23.840
they were a bit
concerned that people

00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:28.090
would stop buying it annual
and move to the quarterly.

00:37:28.090 --> 00:37:30.090
But what they found was
that actually the people

00:37:30.090 --> 00:37:31.820
who were usually
buying the monthly

00:37:31.820 --> 00:37:33.370
started buying the quarterly.

00:37:33.370 --> 00:37:35.810
And there was no
cannibalization of the annual.

00:37:35.810 --> 00:37:39.300
And this resulted in
a 72% lift in RPU.

00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:42.820
Plus they saw 33% more users.

00:37:42.820 --> 00:37:45.290
They also tested
point-in-time messaging.

00:37:45.290 --> 00:37:47.700
So you know I talked
about when Peak

00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:50.224
had that back out flow message.

00:37:50.224 --> 00:37:51.390
Memrise did a similar thing.

00:37:51.390 --> 00:37:54.240
But instead of
targeting non-payers,

00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:56.060
Memrise was seeing if
they could increase

00:37:56.060 --> 00:37:59.280
RPU of existing subscribers.

00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:02.420
So they targeted monthly
and quarterly users,

00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:03.810
or subscribers.

00:38:03.810 --> 00:38:06.530
And we ended up having a really
good learning experience.

00:38:06.530 --> 00:38:08.810
When they were really
smashing it out, winning

00:38:08.810 --> 00:38:12.990
all their tests, Memrise would
give them a call to action,

00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:15.060
hey, you're doing so well.

00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:17.350
Why don't you just
upgrade to the annual pass

00:38:17.350 --> 00:38:19.530
and save some money.

00:38:19.530 --> 00:38:23.550
And this resulted in a doubling
of RPU for those users.

00:38:23.550 --> 00:38:25.790
So Peak and Memrise are
two really good examples

00:38:25.790 --> 00:38:28.190
of developers who have
really, really employed

00:38:28.190 --> 00:38:32.680
price experimentation to
grow revenue and conversion.

00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:35.970
Now the final example
I'll talk about

00:38:35.970 --> 00:38:38.800
is interesting because it's
not about the price itself,

00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:41.490
and it's not about
reference pricing.

00:38:41.490 --> 00:38:44.130
It's about how do you
describe the value

00:38:44.130 --> 00:38:48.160
that you're offering users for
the cash you're asking for.

00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:49.475
Now has anyone used Runtastic?

00:38:51.830 --> 00:38:52.330
Good.

00:38:52.330 --> 00:38:52.920
OK.

00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:56.580
So Runtastic has 17 apps
live in the app store.

00:38:56.580 --> 00:38:58.759
If you know, they started
out as a premium offering.

00:38:58.759 --> 00:39:00.300
And about a year
and a half ago, they

00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:01.940
moved to subscription model.

00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:05.170
So conversion's really
important for them.

00:39:05.170 --> 00:39:07.610
Now what they saw
from their data

00:39:07.610 --> 00:39:10.140
was that people were dropping
off on that final screen,

00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:12.110
on the final purchase screen.

00:39:12.110 --> 00:39:15.610
And they had a suspicion that
maybe if they changed the way

00:39:15.610 --> 00:39:18.200
they presented the copy,
that would have an impact.

00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:20.360
So the original screen
had all the features

00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:22.870
listed out in great detail.

00:39:22.870 --> 00:39:25.640
So what they tested was having
just the one key feature

00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:30.010
called out in a
cleaner simpler screen.

00:39:30.010 --> 00:39:34.310
This resulted in a 103%
lift in conversion.

00:39:34.310 --> 00:39:38.490
So you can see that testing
different price propositions,

00:39:38.490 --> 00:39:40.910
representations,
and descriptions

00:39:40.910 --> 00:39:43.100
can really increase
conversion and revenue.

00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:46.840
So today we've
covered quite a bit.

00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:50.150
We've talked about
how our goal in life

00:39:50.150 --> 00:39:52.360
is to make sure that
every single Android

00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:55.040
user in the world can buy
your content no matter

00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:58.395
where they are and what
format they want to pay in.

00:39:58.395 --> 00:40:00.770
We've talked about how we want
to remove all the friction

00:40:00.770 --> 00:40:02.890
from the payment flow.

00:40:02.890 --> 00:40:04.265
And we've given
you some examples

00:40:04.265 --> 00:40:07.390
of developers who've
used creativity

00:40:07.390 --> 00:40:09.750
and leveraged our platform
in different ways to increase

00:40:09.750 --> 00:40:11.460
revenue.

00:40:11.460 --> 00:40:12.960
Now one thing I'm
going to call out,

00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:15.060
I know we mentioned
analytics before,

00:40:15.060 --> 00:40:16.660
but all of the
developers we talked

00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:20.270
about today use
experimentation and data

00:40:20.270 --> 00:40:23.330
to drive their product pricing
and proposition decisions.

00:40:27.020 --> 00:40:29.505
And they all think
about how much

00:40:29.505 --> 00:40:33.740
can the users in different
countries that I serve afford.

00:40:33.740 --> 00:40:35.032
Now, the Big Mac Index is free.

00:40:35.032 --> 00:40:36.656
You can go and have
a look at it today.

00:40:36.656 --> 00:40:37.390
It's no problem.

00:40:37.390 --> 00:40:39.980
So I really encourage you
to consider these things

00:40:39.980 --> 00:40:41.100
we've talked about today.

00:40:41.100 --> 00:40:43.770
And apply them to
your own app because I

00:40:43.770 --> 00:40:45.620
can speak on behalf
of these guys,

00:40:45.620 --> 00:40:48.110
we're so excited to see
what you'll do next.

00:40:48.110 --> 00:40:48.870
Thank you.

00:40:48.870 --> 00:40:50.370
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:50.370 --> 00:41:06.320
