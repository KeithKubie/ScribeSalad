00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:03.290
- [Instructor] We now have
a lot of experience taking

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:07.330
limits of functions, if
I'm taking limit of f of x.

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:10.690
What we're gonna think about,
what does f of x approach as x

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.520
approaches some value a?

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.420
And this would be equal to some limit.

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:18.640
Now everything we've done up till now

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.690
is where a is a finite value.

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:23.380
But when you look at the graph

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.040
of the function f right over here,

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.210
you see something interesting happens.

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.500
As x gets larger and larger,
it looks like our function f

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.680
is getting closer and closer to two.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.120
It looks like we have a horizontal

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.370
asymptote at y equals two.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.370
Similarly, as x gets
more and more negative,

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.600
it also seems like we have
a horizontal asymptote

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.430
at y equals two.

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.130
So is there some type of notation
we can use to think about

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.790
what is the graph approaching
as x gets much larger

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.090
or as x gets smaller and smaller?

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.770
And the answer there
is limits at infinity.

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.220
So if we want to think
about what is this graph,

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:02.780
what is this function approaching

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.680
as x gets larger and larger,

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.950
we can think about the limit of f of x

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.620
as x approaches positive infinity.

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.610
So that's the notation, and I'm not going

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.760
to give you the formal
definition of this right now.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.930
There, in future videos, we might do that.

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.220
But it's this idea, as x gets
larger and larger and larger,

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.420
does it look like that our function

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.540
is approaching some finite value,

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.470
that we have a horizontal asymptote there?

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.880
And in this situation,
it looks like it is.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.870
It looks like it's
approaching the value two.

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:38.990
And for this particular
function, the limit

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.990
of f of x as x approaches
negative infinity

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.490
also looks like it is approaching two.

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.920
This is not always going to be the same.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.750
You could have a situation, maybe we had,

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:53.940
you could have another function.

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.240
So let me draw a little horizontal

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.290
asymptote right over here.

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.790
You could imagine a function
that looks like this.

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.410
So I'm going to do it like that,

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:05.490
and maybe it does
something wacky like this.

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.790
Then it comes down, and it
does something like this.

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:12.580
Here, our limit as x approaches
infinity is still two,

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.200
but our limit as x
approaches negative infinity,

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.280
right over here, would be negative two.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.170
And of course, there's
many situations where,

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.560
as you approach infinity
or negative infinity,

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.970
you aren't actually
approaching some finite value.

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.520
You don't have a horizontal asymptote.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.330
But the whole point of this video is just

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.070
to make you familiar with this notation.

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.230
And limits at infinity

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.170
or you could say limits
at negative infinity,

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.360
they have a different formal definition

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.430
than some of the limits that
we've looked at in the past,

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.460
where we are approaching a finite value.

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.410
But intuitively, they make sense,

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.243
that these are indeed limits.
