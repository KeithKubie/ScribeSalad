00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:05.050
I guess one question I think I always
have to talk to people about is

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:07.760
when does freemium sort of make sense?

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.340
Or what is the advantage
of going with freemium and

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.600
how is it different from
other typical models?

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.020
And then why is it good for
a subscription software company?

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.620
The reason you approach freemium
is because the idea is, one,

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:23.170
you approach your free users
as if they're lead generation.

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.840
And that they're part of your
marketing side of the equation,

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.100
like these people are the ones who
can get the word out on there.

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.390
And the most important thing that
you should be aware of is like.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.406
Is the market large enough that
a small conversion of those people

00:00:37.406 --> 00:00:40.775
using the product is enough
to make the company large?

00:00:40.775 --> 00:00:44.886
So for example, a local bakery can
only serve people within a small area,

00:00:44.886 --> 00:00:47.830
their potential market
size is a lot smaller.

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:49.540
So you can't just give ton away for

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.100
free because that conversion rate
won't make that business sustain.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.180
But when you have an internet
software company.

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.010
The marginal cost of replication
of offering services is very,

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.480
very cheap and the potential
size of the market is huge,

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.540
because it's the whole world,
everyone on the Internet and

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.880
those forms are big enough,
like all of the use cases for it.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.690
If you have a software
that is very niche, and

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.750
that the cost of each new user or
free user is extremely high,

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.170
you want to rethink maybe
the mechanics of using freemium.

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.840
Like, it's not a one size fits all for
every company.
