00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:27.330

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.950
The difference between a great
recipe and one that's full of

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.540
mistakes is the difference
between a delicious cake and a

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:34.766
complete kitchen disaster.

00:00:34.766 --> 00:00:38.340
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.430
In the case of your DNA, the
recipe that makes you you, it

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.330
could be the difference between
life and death.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:52.460
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.280
The DNA code is made up of pairs
of four letters, or base

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.250
pairs, A and T, and C and G. But
if things go missing, get

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.270
swapped, or the DNA gets
damaged, this leads to

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.730
mistakes in the recipe
of life, and

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:10.890
it can lead to cancer.

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.230
Your DNA is being damaged all
the time, mostly by the

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:17.140
hurly-burly of processes of
life within our cells

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.320
themselves, but also by things
outside the body, by the

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.630
chemicals in tobacco smoke, or
UV radiation from the sun.

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.790
But luckily, nature has
equipped us with tiny

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.090
molecular tool kits that
recognise and repair the

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.430
damage, and one of
them is BRCA2.

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.570
 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.420
Found on Chromosome 13, the
BRCA2 gene encodes a large

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.870
protein that's responsible
for repairing

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:46.900
damage within ourselves.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.500
But if BRCA2 is faulty or
missing, our cells can't

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.780
detect and repair
damage properly.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.660
It builds up, and it
can lead to cancer.

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.850
Inherited faults in BRCA2 are
responsible for cases of

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.810
breast, ovarian, prostate,
and pancreatic

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.220
cancer that run in families.

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.460
But rather than being a strength
for cancer, having a

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.290
fault in the BRCA2 gene may
actually be a weakness, and

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.325
it's one that scientists
are trying to exploit.

00:02:14.325 --> 00:02:19.890
 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.760
Meet my friend Jim.

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.650
Now it turns out your cells
have two ways of repairing

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.360
damage to their DNA.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.030
One of them is with BRCA2
and a related

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.280
protein called BRCA1.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.470
 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.910
And the other is with a
molecule called PARP.

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.200
Yes, PARP.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.450
No sniggering.

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.970
 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.360
If cells have a faulty BRCA2,
they're not so good at

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.090
repairing damage to their DNA.

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.600
But they can still struggle by,
because they have PARP.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.120
It's like having
their belt cut.

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.440
 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.140
But this damage can build up,
and it can lead to cancer.

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.180
Scientists think that treating
these cancer cells with drugs

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.440
that block PARP will mean that
they can't repair their damage

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.450
at all and they'll die.

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.300
It's like cutting the
braces as well.

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.746
 

00:03:13.746 --> 00:03:14.240
Thanks.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:20.170
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.330
Drugs that block PARP, called
PARP inhibitors, are already

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.955
showing promise in clinical
trials for people with cancer

00:03:25.955 --> 00:03:27.900
with BRCA gene faults.

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.620
And one day, they may even be
useful for treating cancer in

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.650
the general population, too.

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.250
But there's a long way to go,
and brilliant scientists

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.040
around the world are busy
cooking up new approaches for

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.050
treating cancer like this.

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:43.020
But unlike my efforts in the
kitchen, developing new

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.330
therapies for cancer isn't
a piece of cake.
