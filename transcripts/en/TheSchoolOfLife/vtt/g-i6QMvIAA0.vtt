00:00:00.539 --> 00:00:06.310
When one is in a bad place in one’s head,
the modern world offers three main sources

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:14.440
of solace: psychiatric medication, CBT and
psychotherapy. Each has its own advantages

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:20.369
and drawbacks. Medication can be exemplary
in a crisis, at points when the mind is so

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:26.080
under siege from fear, anxiety or despair
that thinking things through cannot be an

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:31.399
option. Correctly administered, without requiring
any conscious cooperation from us, pills play

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:36.910
around with our brain chemistry in a way that
helps us get through to the next day – and

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:42.370
the one after. We may get very sleepy, a bit
nauseous or rather foggy in the process, but

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:48.530
at least we’re still around – and functioning,
more or less.Then there is Cognitive Behavioural

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:55.810
Therapy (CBT), normally administered by psychologists
and psychiatrists in six to ten hour-long

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:01.260
sessions which teach us techniques for arguing
rationally with, and with any luck at points

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.560
controlling, the ghoulish certainties thrown
up by our internal persecutors: paranoia,

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:15.370
low self-esteem, shame and panic. Lastly there
is psychotherapy, which from a distance looks

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:21.420
like it has only drawbacks. It has a very
hard time showing its efficacy in scientific

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.940
trials – and has to plead that its results
are too singular neatly to fit the models

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:32.690
offered by statisticians. It takes up a large
amount of time, demanding perhaps two sessions

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:38.830
a week for a couple of years – and is therefore
by far the most expensive option on the menu.

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:45.080
Finally, it requires active engagement from
its patients and sustained emotional effort;

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:51.600
one cannot simply allow chemistry to do the
work. And yet, psychotherapy is, in certain

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:58.711
cases, a hugely effective choice, which properly
alleviates pain not by chance or magic, but

00:01:58.711 --> 00:02:07.020
for three solidly-founded reasons: – Our
unconscious feelings become conscious A founding

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.930
idea of psychotherapy is that we get mentally
unwell, have a breakdown or develop phobias

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.290
because we are not sufficiently aware of the
difficulties we have been through. Somewhere

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:24.280
in the past, we have endured certain situations
that were so troubling or sad, they outstripped

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.549
our rational faculties and had to be pushed
out of day-to-day awareness. For example,

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:34.689
we can’t remember the real dynamics of our
relationship with a parent; we can’t see

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:39.959
what we do every time someone tries to get
close to us, nor trace the origins of our

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:46.249
self-sabotage or panic around sex. Victims
of our unconscious, we can’t grasp what

00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:52.780
we long for or are terrified by. In such cases,
we can’t be healed simply through rational

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:59.099
discussion, as proponents of CBT implicitly
propose, because we can’t fathom what is

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:05.879
powering our distress in the first place.
Therapy is a tool for correcting our self-ignorance

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:12.230
in the most profound ways. It provides us
with a space in which we can, in safety, say

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:17.499
whatever comes into our heads. The therapist
won’t be disgusted or surprised or bored.

00:03:17.499 --> 00:03:23.489
They have seen everything already. In their
company, we can feel acceptable and our secrets

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:30.089
sympathetically unpacked. As a result, crucial
ideas and feelings bubble up from the unconscious

00:03:30.089 --> 00:03:36.290
and are healed through exposure, interpretation
and contextualisation. We cry about incidents

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:41.470
we didn’t even know, before the session
started, we’d been through or felt so strongly

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:48.190
about. The ghosts of the past are seen in
daylight and are laid to rest. There is a

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:55.169
second reason psychotherapy can work so well:
– Transference: Transference is a technical

00:03:55.169 --> 00:04:00.700
term that describes the way, once therapy
develops, a patient will start to behave towards

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:06.719
the therapist in ways that echo aspects of
their most important and most traumatic past

00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:12.510
relationships. A patient with a punitive parent
might – for example – develop a strong

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:18.430
feeling that the therapist must find them
revolting, or boring. Or a patient who needed

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:23.460
to keep a depressed parent cheerful when they
were small might feel compelled to put up

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:30.000
a jokey facade whenever dangerously sad topics
come into view. We transfer like this outside

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.650
therapy all the time, but there, what we’re
doing doesn’t get noticed or properly dealt

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:41.820
with. However, therapy is a controlled experiment
that can teach us to observe what we’re

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:47.700
up to, understand where our impulses come
from – and then adjust our behaviour in

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:53.250
less unfortunate directions. The therapist
might gently ask the patient why they’re

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:58.420
so convinced they must be disgusting. Or they
might lead them to see how their use of jokey

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:06.340
sarcasm is covering up sadness and terror.
The patient starts to spot the distortions

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:12.320
in their expectations set up by their history
– and develops less self-defeating ways

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:23.660
of interacting with people in their lives
going forward. – The First Good Relationship

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:29.810
We are, many of us, critically damaged by
the legacy of past bad relationships. When

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:34.810
we were defenceless and small, we did not
have the luxury of experiencing people who

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:39.140
were reliable, who listened to us, who set
the right boundaries and helped us to feel

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:43.640
legitimate and worthy. Image result for Winnicott
child However, when things go well, the therapist

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:50.550
is experienced as the first truly supportive
and reliable person we’ve yet encountered.

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:57.040
They become the good parent we so needed and
never had. In their company, we can regress

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:03.070
to stages of development that went wrong and
relive them with a better ending. Now we can

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:08.610
express need, we can be properly angry and
entirely devastated and they will take it

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:16.310
– thereby making good of years of pain.
One good relationship becomes the model for

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:22.320
relationships outside the therapy room. The
therapist’s moderate, intelligent voice

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:29.360
becomes part of our own inner dialogue. We
are cured through continuous, repeated exposure

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:36.000
to sanity and kindness.  Psychotherapy
won’t work for everyone; one has to be in

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.340
the right place in one’s mind, one has to
stumble on a good therapist and be in a position

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:47.660
to give the process due time and care. But
that said, with a fair wind, psychotherapy

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:53.920
also has the chance to be the best thing we
ever get around to doing.
