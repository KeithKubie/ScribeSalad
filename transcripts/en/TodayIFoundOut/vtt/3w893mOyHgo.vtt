00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:15.450
Reuel Colt Gridley was born and raised in
Hannibal, Missouri in 1829, and lived there

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:21.410
contemporaneously with Samuel Clemens (aka
Mark Twain), with Clemens claiming Gridley

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:22.499
was a schoolmate of his.

00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:26.710
Leaving Missouri for greater adventure out
west as a teenager, Gridley served in the

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:32.879
Mexican War (1846-1848) and later joined the
great California Gold Rush in 1852.

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:34.129
(See: What Sparked the California Gold Rush?)

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:38.489
He soon left mining and experimented with
a few professions, including banking and mail

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.350
delivery, before following another mine strike
to Austin, Nevada where he established a general

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.350
store.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.449
Easy-going and good-looking, Gridley was successful
as a shopkeeper and popular in town.

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:53.320
In 1864, he ran for mayor of Austin as the
Democratic candidate and struck up a friendly

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.480
wager with the Republican candidate, Dr. H.S.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.450
Herrick: whoever lost the race would have
to carry a 50-pound sack of flour for more

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:05.470
than a mile while a marching band played a
tune of the other’s choice.

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.410
(If Gridley had won, Dr. Herrick would have
marched to Dixie).

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:12.930
Gridley lost, and so, carrying the 50-pound
flour sack decorated with red, white and blue

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.470
ribbons and accompanied by his teenage son
(who was carrying an American flag) and a

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.560
marching band, Gridley marched from Austin
to Clinton while the band played John Brown’s

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:21.560
Body.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.930
Attracting a fair bit of attention, a good
crowd had gathered at the saloon where the

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.950
two opponents ended the day after the procession
was over.

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.830
As neither Mayor Herrick nor Gridley wanted
the flour, it was suggested that they auction

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.760
it off and send the proceeds to the U.S. Sanitary
Commission, an organization established by

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.080
a New York minister to aid wounded Union soldiers.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.630
Samuel Clemens was also in Nevada at that
time, in the neighboring town of Virginia

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:44.630
City.

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:50.010
As he wrote in 1872’s Roughing It, Nevada’s
residents in the 1860s were flush from the

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.560
proceeds of their great silver mines, and
accordingly had more money than they knew

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.080
what to do with.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.960
In that environment, the flour sack was auctioned
off with the winning millman bidding $250.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.640
According to Samuel Clemens, when the millman
was asked where he’d like the flour delivered,

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.030
he stated, “Nowhere- sell it again!”

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.860
Getting into the spirit of things, miner after
miner lined up to bid on it, and each time

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.230
it was sold, following the millman’s example,
it was re-donated, such that by the end of

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.450
the day, $5,000 (about $75,000 today) had
been collected in Austin.

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.690
The story of the flour bag auction spread
and other towns requested that Gridley come,

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.550
with Virginia City being the first to send
him a telegram stating, “Fetch along your

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:29.620
flour sack!”

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.350
Realizing he was on to something, Gridley
did indeed hit the road.

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:37.350
However, in Virginia City, initially the auction
brought in less than had been seen in Austin.

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.780
To rectify this and restore their town’s
pride, a second auction was held.

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.210
Clemens noted,

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:48.340
Till late in the night the principal citizens
were at work arranging the morrow’s campaign,

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.870
and when they went to bed they had no fears
for the result.

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.800
At eleven the next morning a procession of
open carriages, attend by clamorous bands

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.471
of music adorned with a moving display of
flags filed along C street and was soon in

00:02:57.471 --> 00:03:01.390
danger of blockade by a huzzahing multitude
of citizens…

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.500
Gridley stood up and asked who would make
the first bid for the National Sanitary Flour

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.500
Sack.

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.319
Gen W. said: “The Yellow Jacket silver mining
company offers a thousand dollars, coin!”

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:15.670
After this successful auction, Gridley traveled
to other wealthy mining areas, and then throughout

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.800
California (including Sacramento and San Francisco).

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.850
Exhausting the West, he traveled east and
continued to sell the flour sack for charity,

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:27.320
ultimately stopping the campaign in St. Louis,
where the flour was used to bake little cakes

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:31.520
that sold for $1 each (the proceeds of which
also went to the Commission).

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:38.260
In the end, the single, 50 lb. bag of flour
raised close to $275,000 (about $4 million

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.480
today) in the various auctions it was sold
at.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.730
Sadly, Gridley spent his entire life savings
financing the 15,000 mile charitable campaign.

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:51.020
To make matters worse, shortly after he returned
to Austin, the silver boom ended ultimately

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:52.620
killing his General store.

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.680
Suffering from a rheumatic condition, he moved
to Stockton, California where his sister lived

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:57.800
in 1868.

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:13.440
He died two years later 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:36.610
in 1870 at 
the age of 41.
