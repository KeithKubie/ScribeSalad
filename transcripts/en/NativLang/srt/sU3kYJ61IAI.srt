2
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:12,390
let's keep going through
the grammar of words.

3
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:15,570
This time we're going to focus on the
part of speech known as the pronouns.

4
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:18,990
Pronouns work. A lot like nouns.

5
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:23,310
They don't necessarily reference a
specific concept like a noun does,

6
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:25,230
but they can stand in for now,

7
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:29,820
relate back to a now and they often
share a lot of the same properties.

8
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,460
Just like with nouns,

9
00:00:32,461 --> 00:00:35,880
we can expect that pronouns can
reference a specific number,

10
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:40,080
so we might have a distinction between
singular and plural or singular,

11
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:41,250
dual and plural.

12
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:46,050
This allows some languages to distinguish
between a singular you and a group of

13
00:00:46,051 --> 00:00:47,160
you in the plural

14
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:52,950
pronouns also commonly show
person. I am the first person.

15
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:56,970
You are the second person he
she or it is the third person,

16
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:00,840
but notice that an English, we
have a second set for the plural.

17
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,610
We are the first person.

18
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:07,910
You all are the second person and they
are the third person plural in English.

19
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:13,470
The third person singular draws a
distinction between he, she and it,

20
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:18,120
but the third person plural, they doesn't
make this differentiation in Romanian.

21
00:01:18,121 --> 00:01:21,570
On the other hand, gender is actually
reflected in the third person,

22
00:01:21,571 --> 00:01:22,530
plural pronouns.

23
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:26,730
We have Yay for a group of
males or males and females,

24
00:01:26,731 --> 00:01:31,731
mixed gender and yelly for a group
entirely composed of females or feminine

25
00:01:32,401 --> 00:01:37,380
nouns. The final property we'll talk
about when dealing with pronouns is case.

26
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:42,270
This is easier in English because we
actually do distinguish case with our

27
00:01:42,271 --> 00:01:44,010
pronouns. Unlike with our nouns,

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
think about the subject or nominated
case versus the accusative or object case

29
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,570
that I introduced when discussing nouns.

30
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:57,900
I say I when I'm the subject,
but me, when I'm the object.

31
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:01,740
Compare ICU too. You see me?

32
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:06,900
Both of these are first person singular
pronouns. In the first sentence,

33
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:11,990
it's in the nominative or subject case
I and the second it's in the object or

34
00:02:12,421 --> 00:02:13,800
accusative case. Me

35
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:17,203
[inaudible]

36
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,910
just as with nouns,

37
00:02:18,911 --> 00:02:23,911
we can lay all of these properties out
and we ended up with a declension of a

38
00:02:24,071 --> 00:02:24,904
pronoun.

39
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:27,993
[inaudible].

40
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,510
You now have a taste of
the grammar of pronouns.

an overview of adjectives.
