00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:06.630
 
so when one country intervenes and in

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:06.640
so when one country intervenes and in
 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.660
so when one country intervenes and in
other countries civil war one of the

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:09.670
other countries civil war one of the
 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:11.010
other countries civil war one of the
things that happens is it extends the

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:11.020
things that happens is it extends the
 

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:13.049
things that happens is it extends the
war and if you think about it what's

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:13.059
war and if you think about it what's
 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:14.220
war and if you think about it what's
happening is that you're having more

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:14.230
happening is that you're having more
 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:16.380
happening is that you're having more
resources coming into that conflict and

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:16.390
resources coming into that conflict and
 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:18.840
resources coming into that conflict and
it's bringing in your resources bringing

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:18.850
it's bringing in your resources bringing
 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:21.330
it's bringing in your resources bringing
in new interests basically complicating

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:21.340
in new interests basically complicating
 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:22.980
in new interests basically complicating
and complexify in that war that was

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:22.990
and complexify in that war that was
 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:25.590
and complexify in that war that was
already a very complex war there are

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:25.600
already a very complex war there are
 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.420
already a very complex war there are
ways in which intervention might be good

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:27.430
ways in which intervention might be good
 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:28.770
ways in which intervention might be good
which is you're trying to pull the

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:28.780
which is you're trying to pull the
 

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:30.600
which is you're trying to pull the
parties apart not trying to pick sides

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:30.610
parties apart not trying to pick sides
 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:34.049
parties apart not trying to pick sides
one side picking the other side and and

00:00:34.049 --> 00:00:34.059
one side picking the other side and and
 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:36.690
one side picking the other side and and
that can sort of stop the killing but

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:36.700
that can sort of stop the killing but
 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.240
that can sort of stop the killing but
typically before that happens if outside

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:39.250
typically before that happens if outside
 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:40.740
typically before that happens if outside
states are getting involved in a civil

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:40.750
states are getting involved in a civil
 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.020
states are getting involved in a civil
war it tends to extend it so history is

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:43.030
war it tends to extend it so history is
 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.430
war it tends to extend it so history is
mixed on how to best solve civil wars it

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:47.440
mixed on how to best solve civil wars it
 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:48.690
mixed on how to best solve civil wars it
turns out that the international

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:48.700
turns out that the international
 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.250
turns out that the international
community has a strong proclivity toward

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:50.260
community has a strong proclivity toward
 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
community has a strong proclivity toward
negotiated settlements so you want the

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:52.270
negotiated settlements so you want the
 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.139
negotiated settlements so you want the
parties to both lay down their arms and

00:00:55.139 --> 00:00:55.149
parties to both lay down their arms and
 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:57.330
parties to both lay down their arms and
negotiate an end to the civil war where

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:57.340
negotiate an end to the civil war where
 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:58.889
negotiate an end to the civil war where
each of them feels as if they have a

00:00:58.889 --> 00:00:58.899
each of them feels as if they have a
 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:01.139
each of them feels as if they have a
part to play in the configuration of the

00:01:01.139 --> 00:01:01.149
part to play in the configuration of the
 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:02.639
part to play in the configuration of the
new state that is the absolute

00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:02.649
new state that is the absolute
 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:05.160
new state that is the absolute
preference that the international

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170
preference that the international
 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:06.989
preference that the international
community has and it pushes to that we

00:01:06.989 --> 00:01:06.999
community has and it pushes to that we
 

00:01:06.999 --> 00:01:08.520
community has and it pushes to that we
are pushing for that today in Syria

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530
are pushing for that today in Syria
 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.649
are pushing for that today in Syria
Afghanistan there's now a discussion

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:10.659
Afghanistan there's now a discussion
 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:12.120
Afghanistan there's now a discussion
about negotiating with the Taliban

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130
about negotiating with the Taliban
 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.399
about negotiating with the Taliban
because we understand we may not be able

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:14.409
because we understand we may not be able
 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:17.039
because we understand we may not be able
to force an end to this war and that the

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:17.049
to force an end to this war and that the
 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:18.899
to force an end to this war and that the
Taliban are not going anywhere and that

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:18.909
Taliban are not going anywhere and that
 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:20.190
Taliban are not going anywhere and that
we might not what you might have to

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200
we might not what you might have to
 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.679
we might not what you might have to
negotiate with them the problem is in

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:22.689
negotiate with them the problem is in
 

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:24.929
negotiate with them the problem is in
order for a negotiated settlement to to

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:24.939
order for a negotiated settlement to to
 

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:28.469
order for a negotiated settlement to to
resolve a civil war requires both sides

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:28.479
resolve a civil war requires both sides
 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:30.359
resolve a civil war requires both sides
to stay absolutely committed to that and

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:30.369
to stay absolutely committed to that and
 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:32.429
to stay absolutely committed to that and
to remain committed to that for a long

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:32.439
to remain committed to that for a long
 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:34.830
to remain committed to that for a long
time and that requires for both sides or

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840
time and that requires for both sides or
 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.449
time and that requires for both sides or
if it was more than one side you can

00:01:36.449 --> 00:01:36.459
if it was more than one side you can
 

00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:37.709
if it was more than one side you can
think about the former wars in

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:37.719
think about the former wars in
 

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:40.559
think about the former wars in
Yugoslavia more than one side that if

00:01:40.559 --> 00:01:40.569
Yugoslavia more than one side that if
 

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:41.910
Yugoslavia more than one side that if
they renege on the negotiated settlement

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920
they renege on the negotiated settlement
 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.499
they renege on the negotiated settlement
that it's going to be harmful to them

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:43.509
that it's going to be harmful to them
 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:45.569
that it's going to be harmful to them
and to their interests so you want to be

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:45.579
and to their interests so you want to be
 

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:47.969
and to their interests so you want to be
thinking about how to ensure that both

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:47.979
thinking about how to ensure that both
 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:50.550
thinking about how to ensure that both
sides are all sides feel compelled to

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560
sides are all sides feel compelled to
 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.949
sides are all sides feel compelled to
stay aligned with what the negotiated

00:01:52.949 --> 00:01:52.959
stay aligned with what the negotiated
 

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:55.800
stay aligned with what the negotiated
settlement brought in order to end the

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810
settlement brought in order to end the
 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.109
settlement brought in order to end the
war and one way to do that is to ensure

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:58.119
war and one way to do that is to ensure
 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:00.179
war and one way to do that is to ensure
that the security service the Armed

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:00.189
that the security service the Armed
 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:02.639
that the security service the Armed
Forces are configured correctly and that

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:02.649
Forces are configured correctly and that
 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:04.169
Forces are configured correctly and that
they're representative of the broader

00:02:04.169 --> 00:02:04.179
they're representative of the broader
 

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:06.300
they're representative of the broader
nation another way is to have outside

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310
nation another way is to have outside
 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:07.979
nation another way is to have outside
peacekeepers there to keep the parties

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:07.989
peacekeepers there to keep the parties
 

00:02:07.989 --> 00:02:10.469
peacekeepers there to keep the parties
apart so you can think about the former

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479
apart so you can think about the former
 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.390
apart so you can think about the former
Yugoslavia or even Cyprus there are

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400
Yugoslavia or even Cyprus there are
 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.440
Yugoslavia or even Cyprus there are
peacekeepers there and they've been

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450
peacekeepers there and they've been
 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.130
peacekeepers there and they've been
there now for decades in both places and

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140
there now for decades in both places and
 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.899
there now for decades in both places and
they were supposed to be there for one

00:02:18.899 --> 00:02:18.909
they were supposed to be there for one
 

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:21.089
they were supposed to be there for one
year bill President Bill Clinton said we

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:21.099
year bill President Bill Clinton said we
 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:22.679
year bill President Bill Clinton said we
are only going to be there for a year

00:02:22.679 --> 00:02:22.689
are only going to be there for a year
 

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:26.190
are only going to be there for a year
and that was in 1995 it's now 2017 and

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200
and that was in 1995 it's now 2017 and
 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.440
and that was in 1995 it's now 2017 and
similarly in Cyprus in the 1970s

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450
similarly in Cyprus in the 1970s
 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:29.670
similarly in Cyprus in the 1970s
peacekeepers were supposed to be there

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680
peacekeepers were supposed to be there
 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.459
peacekeepers were supposed to be there
temporarily and they're there somewhat

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:32.469
temporarily and they're there somewhat
 

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:34.319
temporarily and they're there somewhat
permanently the good news is you haven't

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:34.329
permanently the good news is you haven't
 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:36.330
permanently the good news is you haven't
had many deaths as a result because the

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340
had many deaths as a result because the
 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.390
had many deaths as a result because the
peacekeepers have kept them apart so

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400
peacekeepers have kept them apart so
 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.319
peacekeepers have kept them apart so
negotiated settlements are one way to

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:40.329
negotiated settlements are one way to
 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:42.089
negotiated settlements are one way to
sort of end Wars and to keep them all

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:42.099
sort of end Wars and to keep them all
 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:44.699
sort of end Wars and to keep them all
ended but actually they're quite there

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709
ended but actually they're quite there
 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:46.740
ended but actually they're quite there
they're not the most common an

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750
they're not the most common an
 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.809
they're not the most common an
alternative is thinking about military

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:48.819
alternative is thinking about military
 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:51.059
alternative is thinking about military
victories which end today about half of

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:51.069
victories which end today about half of
 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:52.949
victories which end today about half of
civil wars prior to the end of the Cold

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959
civil wars prior to the end of the Cold
 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:54.509
civil wars prior to the end of the Cold
War they ended three-quarters of all

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519
War they ended three-quarters of all
 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:57.149
War they ended three-quarters of all
civil wars so a military victory just

00:02:57.149 --> 00:02:57.159
civil wars so a military victory just
 

00:02:57.159 --> 00:02:58.710
civil wars so a military victory just
means that one side prevails on the

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720
means that one side prevails on the
 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.240
means that one side prevails on the
battlefield and it turns out

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250
battlefield and it turns out
 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.250
battlefield and it turns out
historically that they're more robust

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260
historically that they're more robust
 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.440
historically that they're more robust
that one one side wins and prevails in

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450
that one one side wins and prevails in
 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.899
that one one side wins and prevails in
civil war you're more likely to have a

00:03:06.899 --> 00:03:06.909
civil war you're more likely to have a
 

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:10.050
civil war you're more likely to have a
longer lasting settlement and the

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060
longer lasting settlement and the
 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.280
longer lasting settlement and the
question is why is that

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290
question is why is that
 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.379
question is why is that
so I've researched that and it turns out

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:13.389
so I've researched that and it turns out
 

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:16.470
so I've researched that and it turns out
I believe the reason is is because to

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480
I believe the reason is is because to
 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.449
I believe the reason is is because to
reason it turns out that rebel victories

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459
reason it turns out that rebel victories
 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:22.710
reason it turns out that rebel victories
are even more robust one is is that by

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720
are even more robust one is is that by
 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.119
are even more robust one is is that by
defeating the other side you've

00:03:24.119 --> 00:03:24.129
defeating the other side you've
 

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:26.369
defeating the other side you've
demonstrated that you have the capacity

00:03:26.369 --> 00:03:26.379
demonstrated that you have the capacity
 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:27.930
demonstrated that you have the capacity
to defeat the other side right that you

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940
to defeat the other side right that you
 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.270
to defeat the other side right that you
actually have the military might so when

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280
actually have the military might so when
 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.259
actually have the military might so when
you think about those negotiated

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269
you think about those negotiated
 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:32.939
you think about those negotiated
settlements that's what a third party is

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:32.949
settlements that's what a third party is
 

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:34.830
settlements that's what a third party is
providing is the capacity to keep the

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.719
providing is the capacity to keep the
players apart and secondarily

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:36.729
players apart and secondarily
 

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:38.369
players apart and secondarily
particularly when it comes to rebel

00:03:38.369 --> 00:03:38.379
particularly when it comes to rebel
 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:40.080
particularly when it comes to rebel
victories why they're more robust is

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090
victories why they're more robust is
 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.509
victories why they're more robust is
they have legitimacy so they defeated

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519
they have legitimacy so they defeated
 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:45.089
they have legitimacy so they defeated
the government and they usually can

00:03:45.089 --> 00:03:45.099
the government and they usually can
 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:47.520
the government and they usually can
bring the population behind them to

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530
bring the population behind them to
 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:48.960
bring the population behind them to
support the configuration and the

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970
support the configuration and the
 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.610
support the configuration and the
running of the new government and in

running of the new government and in
 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.890
running of the new government and in
fact the rebels quite often bring

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900
fact the rebels quite often bring
 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.860
fact the rebels quite often bring
opposition into government in order to

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870
opposition into government in order to
 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.170
opposition into government in order to
more effectively govern so military

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180

international community sort of doesn't
 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.749
international community sort of doesn't

advocating the use of force or the
 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.879

when it comes to these kinds of things I
 

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:16.020
when it comes to these kinds of things I
look at the international community and

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030
look at the international community and
 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:17.819
look at the international community and
where it wants to go and whether it

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:17.829
where it wants to go and whether it
 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:19.020
where it wants to go and whether it
wants to go into different corners of

wants to go into different corners of
 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:20.430
wants to go into different corners of
the world and it's not willing to go

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440
the world and it's not willing to go
 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.020

but the international community does not
 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.939
but the international community does not
have the will to go in there and

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:46.949

Tamil population and then the other one
is South Sudan with South Sudan it was

00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:36.389
is South Sudan with South Sudan it was
 

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:38.839
is South Sudan with South Sudan it was
actually a rebel victory and basically

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:38.849
actually a rebel victory and basically
 

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:41.120
actually a rebel victory and basically
that was a rebel victory that resulted

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:41.130
that was a rebel victory that resulted
 

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:42.770
that was a rebel victory that resulted
in the partition and the creation of a

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:42.780
in the partition and the creation of a
 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:44.990
in the partition and the creation of a
new state which again partition is quite

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.000
new state which again partition is quite
 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.330
new state which again partition is quite
rare the international community doesn't

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:47.340
rare the international community doesn't
 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:49.490
rare the international community doesn't
support the idea of making new states in

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:49.500
support the idea of making new states in
 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.770
support the idea of making new states in
part because most states in the

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:51.780
part because most states in the
 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:54.050
part because most states in the
international system are multinational

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:54.060
international system are multinational
 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:56.000
international system are multinational
and multi-ethnic and they don't want to

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:56.010
and multi-ethnic and they don't want to
 

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:58.370
and multi-ethnic and they don't want to
set that precedent of allowing one state

00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:58.380
set that precedent of allowing one state
 

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:01.460
set that precedent of allowing one state
to have in one state to allow for pieces

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:01.470
to have in one state to allow for pieces
 

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:04.550
to have in one state to allow for pieces
of it to break off and because they fear

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:04.560
of it to break off and because they fear
 

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:05.930
of it to break off and because they fear
that it will set off a set of domino

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:05.940
that it will set off a set of domino
 

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:07.339
that it will set off a set of domino
it's not only within their own state but

00:06:07.339 --> 00:06:07.349
it's not only within their own state but
 

00:06:07.349 --> 00:06:11.899
it's not only within their own state but
but globally so so victory is a

00:06:11.899 --> 00:06:11.909
but globally so so victory is a
 

00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:13.939
but globally so so victory is a
possibility as well as negotiated

00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:13.949
possibility as well as negotiated
 

00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:16.159
possibility as well as negotiated
settlements and when I look at these

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:16.169
settlements and when I look at these
 

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:18.159
settlements and when I look at these
cases historically and then also

00:06:18.159 --> 00:06:18.169
cases historically and then also
 

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:21.200
cases historically and then also
contemporaneously what I'm looking at is

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:21.210
contemporaneously what I'm looking at is
 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:22.969
contemporaneously what I'm looking at is
is there a will in the capacity of the

00:06:22.969 --> 00:06:22.979
is there a will in the capacity of the
 

00:06:22.979 --> 00:06:24.379
is there a will in the capacity of the
international community to get involved

00:06:24.379 --> 00:06:24.389
international community to get involved
 

00:06:24.389 --> 00:06:26.810
international community to get involved
and if there's not then we might want to

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:26.820
and if there's not then we might want to
 

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:29.180
and if there's not then we might want to
countenance victory for one side of the

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:29.190
countenance victory for one side of the
 

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:30.770
countenance victory for one side of the
other who are the good guys who the bad

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:30.780
other who are the good guys who the bad
 

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:33.439
other who are the good guys who the bad
guys honestly in most civil wars does a

00:06:33.439 --> 00:06:33.449
guys honestly in most civil wars does a
 

00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:35.779
guys honestly in most civil wars does a
little bit of bad on both in some cases

00:06:35.779 --> 00:06:35.789
little bit of bad on both in some cases
 

00:06:35.789 --> 00:06:37.850
little bit of bad on both in some cases
a lot of bad on one side a little bit

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:37.860
a lot of bad on one side a little bit
 

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:40.459
a lot of bad on one side a little bit
about on another and so you want to look

00:06:40.459 --> 00:06:40.469
about on another and so you want to look
 

00:06:40.469 --> 00:06:41.330
about on another and so you want to look
at

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:41.340
at
 

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:44.840
at
