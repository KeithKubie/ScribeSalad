the Kaos is hiding in what's irrelevant

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610
the Kaos is hiding in what's irrelevant
 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.930
the Kaos is hiding in what's irrelevant
and so and that's very interesting

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940
and so and that's very interesting
 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.670
and so and that's very interesting
observation because since the chaos is

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680
observation because since the chaos is
 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.830
observation because since the chaos is
virtually infinite it's a real questions

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840
virtually infinite it's a real questions
 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.660
virtually infinite it's a real questions
where the hell do you put it well you

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670
where the hell do you put it well you
 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.820
where the hell do you put it well you
put it in what you ignore and you can

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830
put it in what you ignore and you can
 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.499
put it in what you ignore and you can
ignore it as long as it isn't actively

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509
ignore it as long as it isn't actively
 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.150
ignore it as long as it isn't actively
interfering with your movement forward

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160
interfering with your movement forward
 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.179
interfering with your movement forward
you can assume that it's that it doesn't

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189
you can assume that it's that it doesn't
 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.550
you can assume that it's that it doesn't
matter that it isn't matter that it

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560
matter that it isn't matter that it
 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.929
matter that it isn't matter that it
doesn't matter same thing all right so

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939
doesn't matter same thing all right so
 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.240
doesn't matter same thing all right so
here's the kicker there's one more class

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250
here's the kicker there's one more class
 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.790
here's the kicker there's one more class
of things that you can run into along

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800
of things that you can run into along
 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.069
of things that you can run into along
the way and this is where the chaos

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079
the way and this is where the chaos
 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:42.590
the way and this is where the chaos
breaks through so let's say you're

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600
breaks through so let's say you're
 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.920
breaks through so let's say you're
moving from point A to point B and

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930
moving from point A to point B and
 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.540
moving from point A to point B and
something that you don't expect

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550
something that you don't expect
 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.840
something that you don't expect
Oh curves and it gets in the way so

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850
Oh curves and it gets in the way so
 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.350
Oh curves and it gets in the way so
let's say that you're living with

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360
let's say that you're living with
 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.760
let's say that you're living with
someone and maybe you kind of like them

someone and maybe you kind of like them
 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:56.900
someone and maybe you kind of like them

you're not married
so you don't like them that much because

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469
so you don't like them that much because
 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:00:59.930
so you don't like them that much because
otherwise you'd ask them to marry you

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940
otherwise you'd ask them to marry you
 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.060
otherwise you'd ask them to marry you

but anyways and so how quarter of youth
 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.130
but anyways and so how quarter of youth
is looking for something better and 3/4

of view is half satisfied something like
 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.469
of view is half satisfied something like
that and then person because we're

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479
that and then person because we're
 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.120
that and then person because we're
ambivalent about such things and then

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130
ambivalent about such things and then
 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.429
ambivalent about such things and then
the person you discover or the person

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439

affair okay so then how are you supposed
to respond emotionally to that well the

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369
to respond emotionally to that well the
 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:24.469

part of you that wasn't all that
 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.090
part of you that wasn't all that
committed to the relationship is kind of

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100
committed to the relationship is kind of
 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.580
committed to the relationship is kind of
exhilarated by that and then the 3/4 of

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590
exhilarated by that and then the 3/4 of
 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.649
exhilarated by that and then the 3/4 of
you that's half satisfied is hurt and

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659
you that's half satisfied is hurt and
 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.480
you that's half satisfied is hurt and
and you're going to exploit that part

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490
and you're going to exploit that part
 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.490
and you're going to exploit that part
for sure in the ensuing discussions and

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500
for sure in the ensuing discussions and
 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.230
for sure in the ensuing discussions and
not mention the oh that's kind of

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240
not mention the oh that's kind of
 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.999
not mention the oh that's kind of
exciting that you you know betrayed me

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009
exciting that you you know betrayed me
 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.889
exciting that you you know betrayed me
that way so so but the point is is that

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899
that way so so but the point is is that
 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.440
that way so so but the point is is that
you that's a whole now what's happened

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450
you that's a whole now what's happened
 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.050
you that's a whole now what's happened
as a whole has you have this structure

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060
as a whole has you have this structure
 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.690
as a whole has you have this structure
that you're walking on like ice like the

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700
that you're walking on like ice like the
 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.429
that you're walking on like ice like the
thin ice that you're skating on and now

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439
thin ice that you're skating on and now
 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.429
thin ice that you're skating on and now
there's a hole in it and the hole we

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439
there's a hole in it and the hole we
 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:56.870
there's a hole in it and the hole we
don't even know how deep the hole is but

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880
don't even know how deep the hole is but
 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.520
don't even know how deep the hole is but
you know there's a hole there and so now

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530
you know there's a hole there and so now
 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.230
you know there's a hole there and so now
you're anxious about it though maybe

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240
you're anxious about it though maybe
 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.819
you're anxious about it though maybe
also a little bit excited because god

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829
also a little bit excited because god
 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.120
also a little bit excited because god
only knows what's down there but but you

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130
only knows what's down there but but you
 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.649
only knows what's down there but but you
don't know how what to do with that hole

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659
don't know how what to do with that hole
 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.869
don't know how what to do with that hole
because it could spread very badly on

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879
because it could spread very badly on
 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.119
because it could spread very badly on
you it could be that you know the whole

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129
you it could be that you know the whole
 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.530
you it could be that you know the whole
relationship was a facade

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540
relationship was a facade
 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.449
relationship was a facade
and that all your relationships have

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459
and that all your relationships have
 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.699
and that all your relationships have
been to saw facades and that the reason

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709
been to saw facades and that the reason
 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:19.020
been to saw facades and that the reason
that is is because you're so damn

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030
that is is because you're so damn
 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.670
that is is because you're so damn
shallow that it's impossible for you to

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680
shallow that it's impossible for you to
 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.589
shallow that it's impossible for you to
have a relationship that isn't just a

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:22.599
have a relationship that isn't just a
 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:24.599
have a relationship that isn't just a
facade and that's partly because you

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:24.609
facade and that's partly because you
 

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:25.770
facade and that's partly because you
don't pay any attention to other people

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780
don't pay any attention to other people
 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.270
don't pay any attention to other people
and it's also partly because you're

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280
and it's also partly because you're
 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.699
and it's also partly because you're
malevolent and selfish so that's a nasty

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709
malevolent and selfish so that's a nasty
 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:31.589
malevolent and selfish so that's a nasty
thing to discover or maybe that's the

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:31.599
thing to discover or maybe that's the
 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:33.630
thing to discover or maybe that's the
sort of person that you're attracting

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640
sort of person that you're attracting
 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.069
sort of person that you're attracting
which would make sense actually if

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:35.079
which would make sense actually if
 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:36.360
which would make sense actually if
that's the sort of person that you are

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370
that's the sort of person that you are
 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.839
that's the sort of person that you are
and so so there are certain things that

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:39.849
and so so there are certain things that
 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:41.670
and so so there are certain things that
you can encounter that basically unglue

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680
you can encounter that basically unglue
 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.160
you can encounter that basically unglue
you and what happens is that those

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170
you and what happens is that those
 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.740
you and what happens is that those
moments of being unglued travel up that

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750
moments of being unglued travel up that
 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.589
moments of being unglued travel up that
entire hierarchy of presuppositions

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599
entire hierarchy of presuppositions
 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:51.780
entire hierarchy of presuppositions
right because the one of the logical

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790
right because the one of the logical
 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.460
right because the one of the logical
conclusions to being betrayed in a

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470
conclusions to being betrayed in a
 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.440
conclusions to being betrayed in a
relationship is that you are that you're

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450
relationship is that you are that you're
 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.210
relationship is that you are that you're
truly a bad person now another equally

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220
truly a bad person now another equally
 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.520
truly a bad person now another equally
logical conclusion is that the person

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530
logical conclusion is that the person
 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:03.750
logical conclusion is that the person
that you're with is really a bad person

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760
that you're with is really a bad person
 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.330
that you're with is really a bad person
and another logical conclusion is all

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340
and another logical conclusion is all
