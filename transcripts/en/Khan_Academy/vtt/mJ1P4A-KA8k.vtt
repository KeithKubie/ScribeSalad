00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:05.930
Write 6 times 6 times 6 times
6 times 6 times 6 times 6

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:11.640
times 6 in exponential
notation.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.260
So what's going on over here?

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:16.590
Well, we have 6 multiplied
by itself how many times?

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.030
Let's see, that's 6 times 1,
then 6 times 2 is that.

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:22.330
That's 6 times-- well,
it's not 6 times 2.

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.490
It's 6 times itself two times.

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.150
Remember, 6 times itself
two times would be 36.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.360
6 times 2 would only be 12.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:36.720
So we have one 6, two 6, three
6, four 6, five 6's, six 6's,

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.240
seven 6's, eight 6's.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.470
So we're multiplying 6 by
itself eight times.

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.380
To write this in exponential
notation, we would say that

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:55.180
this is equal to 6 to the
eighth power, which is

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.550
literally equal to 6 times 6
times 6 times 6 times 6 times

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.220
6 times 6 times 6.

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.670
Now, I want to make it very
clear this is NOT, this is

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:10.500
NOT, this is NOT equal
to 6 times 8.

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.930
6 times 8 will only be 48.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.680
6 to the eighth power is
a super huge number.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.580
6 times 6 is 36, and you're
going to multiply that times

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.880
6, which is what?

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.360
That's like 36 times--
that's what?

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.370
216, and you keep multiplying
it by 6, you get some huge

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.990
number here.

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.690
This number right here.

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.120
It's worthwhile to point out
this number is huge.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.870
This number right here,
not so huge.

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:45.250
It is not huge.

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:46.320
So don't get confused.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.310
If you see 6 to the eighth
power, it's 6 times itself

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.110
eight times, not 6 times 8.
