00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Let's go through these and find an example

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I'm going to focus my attention here.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:11.000
This could either be 1 minus 2 minus 3 or 1 minus 2 minus 3.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
This ends up being 2--1 minus -1.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
This ends up being -4.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Very different answers.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
The parse tree for this interpretation looks a bit like this.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
It's left heavy with this other subtraction--1 minus 2--down and to the left.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Over here the parse tree would be right heavy.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Now, I'm not drawing all the nodes in the parse tree just to save a bit of time.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Mostly, I'm highlighting its shape.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
This is an example of a string that has more than one parse tree in our grammar.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Similarly, this bigger string has more than one parse tree in our grammar.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
It might even have four different parse trees, possibly even more.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
You'd have to try that and find out.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Notably, it contains 1 minus 2 minus 3 as a subpart.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Even if this -4 at the end is perfectly unambiguous,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
it still has exactly the same problems we saw here.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
It still has at least two parse trees.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
It's even worse than its friend two lines above.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.000
If you look carefully, all of the other examples don't demonstrate ambiguity.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Each one of these has exactly one parse tree.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Even this big complicated thing at the bottom only has one parse tree.

00:01:26.000 --> 09:59:59.000
It's perfectly balanced--1 minus 2 on the left, 3 minus for on the right.
