&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Here I have one relation between age and person. The age are the inputs, and

00:00:04.446 --> 00:00:09.049
the type of person is the output. Here's a different relation: This one has an

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:13.218
input of color, and this one has an output of fruit. I want you to tell me

00:00:13.218 --> 00:00:17.455
whether each relation is a function or not. Type yes or no in the boxes.
