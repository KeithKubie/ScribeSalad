00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:57.899
As the old adage goes, money doesn’t buy
happiness, but it sure takes the sting out

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.090
of being poor.

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.359
Gordon Bennett Jr. was a man for whom money
meant nothing- he spent money with such impunity

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.210
that across the pond in England his name has
since become synonymous with astonishment

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:09.530
and surprise.

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.210
The son of famed newspaper magnate James Gordon
Bennett Sr., James Gordon Bennett Jr. (or

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.890
Gordon as he preferred to be known to differentiate
himself from his father) was born with a shiny

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.909
new silver spoon in his mouth in 1841.

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:27.360
Educated mostly in France, Bennett arrived
in New York at the age of 16 in the only manner

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:34.230
befitting a young man of his station- aboard
a giant 77 ton yacht his father bought him

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:35.500
called Rebecca.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.600
As an aside, we should probably talk about
Bennett Sr. for a moment because, while he

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.659
didn’t live a life as outlandishly lavish
as his son, he did go a long ways towards

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.520
“inventing” modern journalism.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.950
A Scottish immigrant, Bennett Sr. was inspired
by Ben Franklin’s autobiography to come

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.440
to the United States and start a publishing
empire.

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.250
Unfortunately for him, once in America, most
of his early efforts on this front failed

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.390
miserably, though he found work as a proof-reader
and eventually assistant editor at the New

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:05.610
York Courier.

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:11.039
His fortunes changed at the age of 40 when
he founded the New York Herald in 1835, a

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.320
paper which was, for a time, the most widely
read in the States.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:20.250
This was in part thanks to Daddy Bennett’s
steadfast efforts to ensure his publication

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.640
was the first to print any breaking news,
and that when possible coverage should also

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.890
be extremely in-depth.

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.170
Bennett Sr.’s thinking was that people would
naturally want to buy the paper that printed

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.450
news first, rather than the one that took
the time to be the most accurate, and towards

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.470
this end he hired scores of reporters and
tasked them with getting the first-hand scoop

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.300
on any story before his competitors.

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.379
The Herald was apparently the favourite paper
of none other than Abraham Lincoln, who read

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:52.670
it religiously thanks to its near unparalleled
coverage of the Civil War, which was accomplished

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.800
via Bennett Sr. literally sending his reporters
to the front line to dig up stories.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.490
Bennett Sr. also pioneered the art of the
news interview, starting right in his paper’s

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.850
first ever front page report covering the
murder of a prostitute, in which Bennett Sr.

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:05.850
himself interviewed a madam at a brothel said
prostitute had worked at.

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.620
That said, the Herald’s reputation wasn’t
one associated with impeccable journalism.

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.370
One of the other reasons the paper was so
successful was Bennett Sr.’s implementation

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:19.150
of various timeless journalism tactics like
not just reporting news, but any sensationalist

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.290
gossip (think “Angelina and Brad- Why She
Left!”) they heard too, as well as making

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:27.569
sure wherever possible that the headlines
resembled the 19th century equivalent of click-bait.

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:31.480
Not content to wait on stories to come to
him or relying on his journalists to find

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.910
them, Bennett Sr. also did things like publicly
offer money to any woman who was willing to

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:41.410
“set a trap for a Presbyterian parson, and
catch one of them flagrante delicto…”

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.880
Not just interested in reporting other people’s
liaisons, he also wasn’t hesitant to talk

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.849
about his own, as well as describing in detail
his wife’s body for the masses to drool

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:53.610
over, along with intimate details of their
wedding.

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:58.630
Beyond this, the paper was happy to completely
contradict itself on any story or opinion

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:03.130
piece, and inconsistencies in facts in individual
reports would often go completely ignored

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:07.849
by the editors if the potential falsities
made the story more compelling.

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:12.350
As Bennett Sr. once reportedly quipped about
the sometimes lax accuracy standards of his

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:15.200
paper’s reporting, “I print my paper every
day.”

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.190
(He would later also implement an evening
edition of the Herald, printing twice a day

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:22.229
to help ensure the paper never got scooped.)

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:26.710
As you might expect from printing every bit
of salacious gossip around town, as well as

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:32.370
instigating some of it, this resulted in rival
papers labeling the Herald as nothing more

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.680
than “gutter press”, as well as made Bennett
Sr. his fair share of enemies.

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.949
It’s for this reason that Bennett Sr. sent
his son, wife and daughter to Paris, so they

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:45.530
didn’t have to endure the threats and jeers
that he did when out and about around town.

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:49.539
In fact, there was a persistent rumour, whether
true or not isn’t clear, that Bennett Sr.’s

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:54.139
office featured a store of hidden weapons
for when people offended by one of his paper’s

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:58.090
stories tried to storm his office and he had
to defend himself.

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:04.340
Back to Bennett Jr.- when he returned to New
York as a teen to begin learning the tools

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:10.029
of his father’s trade, he made an immediate
splash amongst the high society sorts by becoming

00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:15.310
the youngest member of the prestigious New
York Yachting Club at just 16 years and 3

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:16.310
months old.

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:19.960
Not just let in because of his daddy’s bank
account, commanding a crew of nearly two dozen

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.870
in various races, it is noted by the club’s
history that the Rebecca frequently finished

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:30.779
near the top of the results for several years
until Bennett bought an even more garish yacht

00:05:30.779 --> 00:05:31.779
to replace it.

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:38.229
In fact, in 1866 with his new ship, the Henrietta,
Bennett Jr. actually won the first ever transatlantic

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:42.759
yacht race completing the journey from New
Jersey to the Isle of Wight (a distance of

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:48.430
about 3,000 miles or 4800 km) in just under
14 days.

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:52.330
Speaking of the Henrietta, during the American
Civil War Bennett graciously volunteered it

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:53.330
for service.

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:57.169
During his time in the military aboard his
luxury yacht, Bennett and the Henrietta, among

00:05:57.169 --> 00:06:02.689
other escapades, took part in an operation
to recapture Fernandina in Florida.

00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:08.020
After leaving the military, Bennett returned
to doing what he did best- partying and consorting

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:09.460
with New York’s elite.

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:14.110
In time, Bennett’s drunken exploits became
the stuff of legend amongst the world’s

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:15.210
high society.

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:19.839
Much like his father before him, when Bennett
Jr. took over the Herald at the age of 25

00:06:19.839 --> 00:06:24.949
upon his father’s retirement, he was all
too happy to disseminate unflattering stories

00:06:24.949 --> 00:06:31.270
of his own misdeeds to the masses, making
Bennett a tidy profit off of his debauchery.

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:35.539
Unfortunately for us, this also makes it difficult
to determine how much of the stories of his

00:06:35.539 --> 00:06:39.960
various escapades reported were exaggerated
for effect.

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:44.069
Examples of this include his bizarre practice
of riding his personal carriage about the

00:06:44.069 --> 00:06:49.130
streets of the city at break-neck speeds in
the middle of the night completely nude.

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:53.229
Far from being a rare occurrence, this was
seemingly one of Bennett’s favourite drunken

00:06:53.229 --> 00:06:58.120
hobbies, just behind sailing, the frequency
of the reports making us reasonably certain

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:02.479
this particular eccentricity was accurately
reported, as well as helping to earn Bennett

00:07:02.479 --> 00:07:04.279
Jr. the nickname, “The Mad Commodore”.

00:07:04.279 --> 00:07:05.279
Jennie (Jerome) Churchill
Jennie (Jerome) Churchill

00:07:05.279 --> 00:07:10.270
Not exactly the safest thing in the world,
this did occasionally result in injury.

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:15.229
Most notable to subsequent history was a time
when (a reportedly fully clothed) Bennett

00:07:15.229 --> 00:07:19.930
took the young Jennie Jerome, daughter of
the “King of Wall Street” Leonard Jerome,

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:22.229
on just such a high speed carriage ride.

00:07:22.229 --> 00:07:26.419
Unfortunately for the pair, Bennett lost control
of the vehicle causing the carriage to overturn,

00:07:26.419 --> 00:07:31.330
an accident that could have potentially been
lethal to one or both, but in which they emerged

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:33.770
bruised, but alive.

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:37.261
Why is Jennie not being crushed or otherwise
maimed by the carriage significant to history?

00:07:37.261 --> 00:07:42.370
The noted American beauty would grow up to
be the equally interesting individual, Lady

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:47.360
Jeanette Churchill, mother of Sir Winston
Churchill.

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:51.509
Back to Bennett’s love of the sea- as alluded
to, Bennett invested a considerable amount

00:07:51.509 --> 00:07:57.330
of money in a number of luxury yachts which
ranged from world record setting racing schooners

00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:02.710
to massive, cruise liner looking behemoths,
bloated with a host of interesting features.

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:07.689
The most indulgent of these was probably a
room Bennett had constructed on his 100 yard

00:08:07.689 --> 00:08:17.539
(92 metre) yacht, the $635,000 ($17.8 million
today) Lysistrata.

00:08:17.539 --> 00:08:21.300
What was so special about this room?

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:25.319
Beyond that it featured the somewhat novel
(for the age) large electric fan for cooling

00:08:25.319 --> 00:08:29.659
purposes, the room was designed to comfortably
house a cow.

00:08:29.659 --> 00:08:30.659
Why?

00:08:30.659 --> 00:08:35.520
So Bennett always had fresh milk, cream, and
butter while at sea.

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:39.780
The ship also included, among numerous rooms
for the large crew and guests, three personal

00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:43.479
suites on different decks so Bennett wouldn’t
have to be troubled with walking too far to

00:08:43.479 --> 00:08:45.110
his quarters at any given time.

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:49.100
It also contained an automobile that would
be transported to shore whenever Bennett arrived

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:53.810
someplace, including famously on one journey
to Bermuda in 1906 in which Bennett’s car

00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:56.820
was the first ever driven those shores.

00:08:56.820 --> 00:09:01.810
This was much to the consternation of one
of the Herald‘s more famous occasional authors,

00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:07.150
Mark Twain, who noted of the idea of a car
in Bermuda, “It would be a fatal error to

00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:12.930
attract to Bermuda the extravagant and sporting
set who have made so many other places entirely

00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:16.790
intolerable to persons of taste and cultivation.”

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:20.510
Another example of Bennett’s reported antics
occurred one evening while he was dining at

00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:26.010
the New York Union Club when a fire started,
prompting the very drunk paper mogul to leap

00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:30.850
into action and begin directing the firefighters
on how to properly tackle the blaze.

00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:34.070
The firefighters got so annoyed with Bennett’s
“help” that they launched him across the

00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:37.050
street by spraying him with the high pressure
hose.

00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:40.260
It was reported that the next day Bennett
had little memory of any of this, but upon

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:44.470
being informed by one of his friends how he’d
gotten so wet and of his drunken antics the

00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:49.520
night previous, Bennett bought every firefighter
in the department a brand new overcoat by

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:50.830
way of apology.

00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:55.620
On yet another occasion, after losing a bet,
Bennett drunkenly rode a pony through the

00:09:55.620 --> 00:10:00.610
dining room of a Newport social club, prompting
them to ban him for life.

00:10:00.610 --> 00:10:04.210
Bennett purportedly reacted to the ban by
buying the building next door, turning it

00:10:04.210 --> 00:10:07.940
into a social club of his own and inviting
all of their members to join.

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:11.831
This was by no means the pettiest purchase
Bennett reportedly ever made though; that

00:10:11.831 --> 00:10:15.690
honour belongs to the time he tried to get
a seat in his favourite restaurant and was

00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:16.690
rebuffed.

00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:21.630
Offended, Bennett did a Bruce Wayne and simply
purchased the restaurant to avoid such an

00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:22.630
issue in the future.

00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:27.030
While it may seem that Bennett was a stereotypical
trust-fund baby spending daddy’s money without

00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:31.450
working a day in his life, he was also known
for being an exceptionally astute businessman

00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:36.090
and very generous with his personal fortune,
frequently donating exceptionally large sums

00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:40.280
at random to various charities around town,
often seemingly on a whim.

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:45.210
Other times he was more thoughtful about such
donations, such as during the Panic of 1873

00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:48.390
when he opened a soup kitchen to ensure no
one in the city need go hungry.

00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:53.340
Not one to do things half way, the soup and
sandwiches handed out were made at the then

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:55.240
prodigious Delmonico’s restaurant.

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:59.410
As for his work, when he took over the Herald
in 1866, Bennett followed his father’s lead

00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:04.690
and took a number of steps to ensure the paper
continued to be known for breaking, sensationalist

00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:05.690
news.

00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:09.320
Among his more famous ventures as a newsman
was that time he sponsored the journey of

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:14.680
one Henry Morton Stanley to track down the
famed, supposedly missing, Scottish missionary

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:17.120
and explorer Dr David Livingston.

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:18.750
Russell E. Train Africana Collection, Smithsonian
Institution Libraries.Bennett funded Stanley’s

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:24.820
harrowing, approximately 700 mile (1100 km)
adventure through Africa on the condition

00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:27.340
that the Herald got to cover it exclusively.

00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:32.690
He also made sure Stanley travelled in the
lap of luxury by providing not just excessive

00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:37.340
funds for the journey but, according to a
contemporary report, “a compact force of

00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:43.810
three whites, thirty-one armed freemen of
Zanzibar as escort, 150 porters and 27 pack

00:11:43.810 --> 00:11:44.810
animals”.

00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:48.310
However, it should be noted that according
to Stanley’s own journal, his expedition

00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:52.070
actually “only” numbered 111 at its peak.

00:11:52.070 --> 00:11:58.060
(You can read more about this little adventure
in Stanley’s book, How I Found Livingston.)

00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:01.990
Of course, Dr Livingston hadn’t actually
mysteriously disappeared as the Herald purported;

00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:06.000
he just disappeared from the wider public
eye for several years partially owing to doing

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.590
little of note in that time, not helped by
the fact that the majority of the letters

00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:13.050
he wrote home were lost in transit.

00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:16.730
This all lead Bennett to decide to fund an
expedition to find out whatever happened to

00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:18.570
the once famous missionary.

00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:23.510
The sensationalized version of the story kept
the masses enthralled as they read about Stanley’s

00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:27.190
adventure through African jungles searching
for the good Doctor.

00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:30.950
When Stanley finally found Livingston near
Lake Tanganyika in Ujiji on November 10, 1871,

00:12:30.950 --> 00:12:35.980
it was reported in the Herald that he uttered
the now famous line: “Dr Livingston, I presume?”

00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:40.030
To which Livingston supposedly replied the
lesser remembered, “Yes.

00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:42.890
I feel thankful that I am here to welcome
you.”

00:12:42.890 --> 00:12:48.030
Bennett additionally funded an ill-fated polar
trip in 1879 by the explorer George Washington

00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:50.990
De Long, who sadly died on the journey.

00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:54.690
Beyond this, another harebrained product of
his media savvy included that time he had

00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:59.580
the Herald print a story of a mass breakout
of wild animals at the Central Park Zoo in

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:05.340
1874, with the animals rampaging about town
causing death, mutilations, and mayhem in

00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:07.640
the streets, all described in gory detail.

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:11.650
The front page headline that day read: “A
Shocking Sabbath Carnival of Death.

00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:13.260
Savage Brutes at Large.

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:16.240
Awful Combats Between the Beasts and Citizens”.

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:20.240
Of course, none of this actually happened,
but the public ate the story up, and many

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:24.690
a confused competing newspaper wondered how
they’d missed such a huge story happening

00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:25.950
right under their noses.

00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:29.950
It was explained near the back of the paper
that the front-page zoo breakout story hadn’t

00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:34.180
actually happened but was simply there to
illustrate what could happen given the lax

00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:37.210
caging standards at the zoo at the time.

00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:42.520
Beyond explorers and sensationalized made
up stories, the paper funded a number of sporting

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:45.110
events, something of a novel concept at the
time.

00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:49.260
For instance, Bennett paid to ensure that
his newspaper had exclusive coverage rights

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:53.841
of many such events, often helping to organize
them himself- including some of the first

00:13:53.841 --> 00:13:58.300
balloon races, soccer matches (in the U.S.),
and auto racing events.

00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:03.240
He even organised the first known professional
tennis and polo matches ever held on U.S.

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:08.760
soil, including paying to bring over the entire
British Polo team in 1878 to show the Americans

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:09.990
how it was done.

00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:13.660
These latter two were sports he became a fan
of while in Europe, spending much of his adult

00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:18.300
life living in Paris, attempting to grow the
European branch of his paper, The Paris Herald,

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:21.520
while running the main U.S. branch from afar,
for reasons we’ll get to shortly.

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:26.420
To help in managing his affairs from across
the pond, in 1883 he helped found a company

00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:31.970
that laid the first non-Western Union telegraph
cable linking the United States to Europe,

00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:35.670
drastically cutting the cost of this high
speed communication between the two continents

00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:38.180
thanks to breaking Western Union’s monopoly.

00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:42.380
However, even with this technology, it is
noted that the New York Herald suffered from

00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:46.690
having its manager living abroad, rather than
living locally and having his finger on the

00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:47.780
pulse of the city.

00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:52.240
As a result, not long after his move, the
paper’s circulation began a slow but steady

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:55.560
decline from its peak in 1885.

00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:59.800
Interestingly enough, Bennett Jr. actually
predicted communication mediums like the telegraph

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:03.951
would ultimately put newspapers out of business,
as he thought people would eventually just

00:15:03.951 --> 00:15:07.670
get their news instantly that way, rather
than needing to wait for papers to be printed.

00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:11.910
Thus, he felt the only news agencies that
would survive the paradigm shift would be

00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:16.640
those who put value not just on reporting
the facts of the news, as was common at the

00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:22.000
time among many respected publications, but
taking the time to analyze and provide commentary

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.250
on it, giving people something unique they
couldn’t just get anywhere.

00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:29.990
He noted of this, “‘Mere newspapers — the
circulators of intelligence merely — must

00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:35.779
submit to destiny and go out of existence”,
and that a result of technology displacing

00:15:35.779 --> 00:15:40.380
the classic newspaper format would be that
“The intellectual, philosophic and original

00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:45.720
journalist will have a greater, a more excited
and a more thoughtful audience than ever.”

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:49.000
As for his home life, Bennett lived the life
of a bachelor until he was married at age

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:54.779
73, though he was briefly engaged in 1877
to a prominent socialite on the New York scene

00:15:54.779 --> 00:15:56.100
called Caroline May.

00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:58.779
In fact, The Edwardsville Intelligencer reported
that,

00:15:58.779 --> 00:16:02.920
The trousseau of Miss May, who is to marry
James Gordon Bennett, has arrived from Europe,

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:08.130
where it was collected at an expense of $20,000
[about half a million dollars today], according

00:16:08.130 --> 00:16:09.130
to gossips.

00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:14.110
It is said to be the most elaborate and beautiful
ever prepared for an American lady.

00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:18.920
What happened to end the high profile engagement
is subject to some debate, but the general

00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:23.470
rumour at the time was that Bennett drunkenly
stumbled into a party held by Caroline’s

00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:28.710
family, during which he used either the family’s
fireplace, piano, or a house plant as a toilet

00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:31.640
while the other prestigious guests looked
on in shock.

00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:35.680
(This event would later get Bennett listed
in the Guinness Book of World Records for

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:38.440
the “Greatest Engagement Faux Pas”.)

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:42.420
Whatever the exact details, the result was
the wedding being almost immediately called

00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:43.420
off.

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:47.680
Shortly thereafter it was reported in The
Perry Chief, “James Gordon Bennett was publicly

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:52.470
horse-whipped this morning, by Frederick May,
brother of the girl to whom Bennett was engaged

00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:53.590
to be married.”

00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:56.110
After the drubbing, Frederick challenged Bennett
to a duel.

00:16:56.110 --> 00:17:00.710
Neither man was injured in the ensuing shootout
(each individual’s shot missed, despite

00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:02.620
only being 12 paces away).

00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:07.170
Directly thereafter, whether from embarrassment
or rumoured fear of Caroline’s brother,

00:17:07.170 --> 00:17:11.500
Bennett high-tailed it to Paris where he remained
for most of the rest of his life.

00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:15.620
Bennett would remain single for another four
decades, eventually marrying the widow of

00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:22.439
the son of the founder of Reuters news agency,
Maud Potter, then 48 years old, in 1914.

00:17:22.439 --> 00:17:25.130
Bennett died four years later in 1918.

00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:29.330
Today Bennett’s legendary reputation for
debauchery and excess lives on in the UK as

00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:35.580
a popular exclamation of incredulity, “Gordon
Bennett!”, with the first known documented

00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:39.809
instances of the exclamation popping up about
two decades after his death.

00:17:39.809 --> 00:17:45.010
Yes, this man lived so hard and so fast with
so many incredulous stories surrounding his

00:17:45.010 --> 00:19:35.230
life that today his very name is synonymous
with something unbelievable.

00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:39.960
Gordon Bennett Jr. also has the distinction
of helping to popularise the name Gordon.

00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:44.730
Before the late 19th century, Gordon as a
first name was almost unheard of, being a

00:19:44.730 --> 00:19:49.720
somewhat obscure Scottish surname, which is
how it ended up as Gordon Bennett Sr.’s

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:50.720
middle name.

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:54.110
It is theorised that the rise in popularity
of “Gordon” as a first name coinciding

00:19:54.110 --> 00:20:05.230
with the point in which James “Gordon”
Bennett Jr.s’ life started becoming highly

00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:11.469
publicised on both sides of the pond is no
coincidence.
