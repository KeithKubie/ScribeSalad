00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.500
 These are some of the competing paintings, such as: 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.500
 Gerard David's painting "The Judgment of Cambyses" 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.800
 Hieronymus Boss of Hell (*) * (*): A painting made up of three sections called "Garden of Land Lilies" 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.060
 Henry Fossley's painting: "The Nightmare" 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.060
 Edvard Monk's painting: "Cry." 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:44.600
 But there is only one panel that really scared me, 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:46.860
 These are. 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.800
 Francisco Joya's painting: "Saturn devours his son" 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:57.000
 What you see now the Spanish artist imagines the giant Cronos 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.860
 He is devouring one of his sons according to a prophecy that he will give birth to one of his offspring who is raping his king as he did to his father. 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:11.400
 Every time his wife gives birth to Rhea, a son is eaten by Kronos, so that the prophecy can not be fulfilled. 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.260
 Unfortunately for him, Ria conspired against him and hid their son Ghar, Zeus 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:22.220
 Who in turn fulfilled the prophecy, denied his father, and ended the rule of the Giants. 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.620
 This tale, a famous Greek legend, but look at how Joya portrayed. 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.160
 Some notable paradoxes are obvious at first sight. 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.880
 In the beginning, Cronos devours his children by swallowing them at once, according to legend. 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:39.340
 In fact, they are still alive in his stomach. The Joya plate here, more sinister. 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:46.099
 Here he was inspired by the Flamenco artist Rubens, who in turn painted the same legend as well. 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:53.440
 Saturn, painted by Rubens seems to absorb the life of his child, even with this atrocity, 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:02:00.500
 Robbins depicts drama, vitality, and beauty as well, characterized by the baroque style that made him known in turn. 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.120
 At Joya, that beauty is nil. 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.200
 We stay with the crazy monster panicked. 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.480
 As if he had been discovered in the middle of the darkness by a mobile phone carrying a torch, entered the wrong cave. 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.380
 Saturn, the name of the Roman Crowns, has already finished taking off a small head, 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.920
 His black mouth wraps around the elbow of his left hand in preparation for his leg from his joint. 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.600
 And its rectangular body curved in a strange position, 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.280
 His hands digging in the spine, 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:37.700
 Blood is flowing down the arm, neck and shoulder of his son, in a frighteningly basic color. 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.160
 Looking closely, we will notice that this body is not a child at all. 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.719
 But it is one of the bodies of adult Saturnians. 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:51.770
 There is something more shocking in our knowledge that the victim knew what was happening to her and her failed attempt to survive. 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:58.540
 But the real horror - I think - lies in when and where the painting was discovered. 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:04.720
 In the end of his life, Francisco Goya bought a house on the outskirts of Madrid, nicknamed "La Quinta del Sordo" 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:10.840
 Or villa deaf according to his former owner, and this is a strange coincidence; 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.760
 Because Joya was also deaf. 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:19.180
 His physical and mental state was in decline, and Joya painted fourteen mural, called 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.400
 "Black Paintings" 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.300
 Directly on the walls of his inner house. 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.100
 And the painting "Saturn devours his son"? 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:26.521
 They were in the dining room. 

00:03:26.521 --> 00:03:31.140
 The pictures you see now take fifty years to come. 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.180
 Joya did not refer to the paintings himself. 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.340
 No one had intended to see it 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.700
 But to this day, people are puzzled about the meaning of these black paintings. 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:46.820
 Why did Joya create these pessimistic scenes in his home? 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.960
 Maybe going back to his career helps us understand. 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:56.520
 He grew up in Zaragoza, Spain. The fourth of six children in a family with a lower middle class. 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:03.700
 He was a delightful boy, while he was a painting student in Zaragoza, Madrid and Rome. 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:11.900
 His first serious career consisted of his ornate decoration; to decorate palaces and luxury houses in the city. 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.900
 These spaces are inspired by 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:15.780
 "Rococo Style" 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:22.850
 Elegant, comic, and nice, taken from the lives of nobles and peasants, they enjoy their daily endeavors. 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:29.100
 Joya eventually became the painter of King Charles IV, a hopeless king 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:35.360
 Unlike his father, Charles III who was loved by the public; for he proceeded and began to attend 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.359
 Enlightened secular values ​​of Spain. 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.880
 In 1793, Joya was infected with an unknown disease 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:42.650
 Caused by its design. 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:49.720
 He was still fulfilling the requests of his royal clients, and the disease was a disastrous turning point in his life and art. 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.000
 Seen in his painting "Yard With Lunatics" (*) of 1794 (*): Joya said he saw this event in mental estates in Zaragoza. 

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:56.480
 Bodies fighting and comforting from torment. 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:00.340
 The difference between these and decorative frames 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:01.100
 Awesome teams. 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:08.500
 With his unhealthy reputation, Joya began to see the country around him with a clear vision of fainting in a series of seals 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:15.100
 Los Caprichos or Freaks, making the Spanish culture a tragic debacle at the same time. 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:18.060
 Under the shadow of Enlightenment, Joya sees the country 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:23.340
 It retreated from the line of modernity. The king occupies a concern, people 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:26.900
 Obsessed with superstition, so stupid that they do not realize what they want. 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:31.840
 You can see him confuse all the mysteries of his fantasies, and run behind the detailed truth 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:36.980
 The need for social criticism, obsession with animals and monsters. 

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:42.960
 All this is sumptuously summed up in "mind sleep awakens the monsters". 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:47.000
 Things got worse in the following years in Spain. 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.180
 Napoleon invaded the country, slaying who was objecting to his campaign. 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:56.080
 Joya was a witness to the shedding of this blood, and this deeply hurt him. 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:01.300
 His painting on this subject, May 3, 1808, was a revealing description 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.000
 Of brutality, war and resistance. 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.640
 Before this, "war" was a theatrical component in art. 

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:15.340
 Joya here only depicts cruel power. Just a passion without fake mediation. 

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:18.660
 Five years until Spain regained its throne. 

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:22.320
 During it, the resistance established a body in 1812, 

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:28.440
 It was demanding liberal reforms, such as national sovereignty, freedom of the press and free trade. 

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:36.490
 But with King Ferdinand VII gaining power, this body was destroyed immediately and he was apprehended by those who founded it. 

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.220
 Joya withdrew and is disappointed in 

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:46.940
 The country that in his youth was seeking a new world, but now the aristocrats swallowed it again. 

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:54.000
 He encouraged the war, became sick with illness, and began to paint nightmare scenes in the walls of his house. 

00:06:54.980 --> 00:07:01.100
 In one of them, a boy is eaten by a father, prophesying his king's court on his hand. 

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:07.280
 Until now, Joya knew that this progress was uncertain, and when he was wrong, he did not make it painful 

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:11.840
 But makes it terrifying, and slow, and the victim feel it during the occurrence. 

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:15.900
 There are a lot of ways to read the "Saturn devouring his son." 

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:22.100
 Perhaps Joya was trying to expel the demons that hovered in his head, or the demons of his country. 

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:27.380
 Or perhaps he was trying to honestly portray one of the terrifying aspects of human life 

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:32.580
 Using the skills and techniques he learned, and developed throughout his life. 

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:38.520
 The "black paintings" changed the history of art, but what remains the most shocking 

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:41.160
 Is that Joya was not interested. 

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:46.900
 He does not care about our way of reading this painting, because he did not paint it for us or for anyone. 

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:52.020
 The interpretations are unable to describe the meaning of the painting "Saturn devours his son". 

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:56.580
 It is a brute force, a horror without any intermediary. 

00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:01.500
 A monster watching from a dark wall in a dark room, 

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:05.280
 Mating.
