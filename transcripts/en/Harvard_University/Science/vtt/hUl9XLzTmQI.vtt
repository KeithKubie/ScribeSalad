00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:12.070
Five years ago when I when I started  here
I was very excited to become part of 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:12.979
the Harvard cell institute

00:00:12.979 --> 00:00:19.439
it was a large part of the reason I relocated to boston
it was the most exciting group of scientist

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:25.239
really organizing together and working together and I was 
just thrilled to be apart of that

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:28.699
 but I don't think I really appreciated how special it 
would be

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:33.120
and.. I think nobody could have predicted
the advances that have been made within

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.290
the last five years

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.070
Really HNCI investigators have been at the the heart
of 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:46.070
major breakthroughs in a whole host of different

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.120
stem cell areas weather it be in coming to 
a better understanding of how

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.000
bone marrow stem cells form all the different
constituents of the blood

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.910
weather or not its gaining wagers important work 
on the discovery muscle of

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:08.010
muscle precursor cells which are essentially 
the stem cell of the muscle in which constantly regenerating

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.200
every time that we worked out

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.630
to of course

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.700
the mind-boggling break thoughts in reprograming  
technology that have occurred over the last five

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:18.660
years

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:24.350
really in in that field and in particular and
and in fields of reprograming

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.229
and embryonic stem cell biology

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:32.390
I don't think we could have ever
imagine that we would be were we are today

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:39.390
certainly  reprogram technology is
much more accessible then nuclear transfer was

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.210
for creating these plurry Colton lines 
but 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.190
 in addition i think we've learned
a lot about

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.300
the adult stem cell how to manipulate those cells

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.520
as model of  disease as well

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.330
so taking what was a disease that you could only study
in the body 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.940
and translating it into a disease that you can now study
in a lavatory dish

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:02.630
and figuring out

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:09.069
drugs and small molecules  that will cause those disease
cells to act more like normal cells

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:11.299
and then ultimately take those back into
patients

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:15.039
 i don't think thats all going to happened in 
five years but i think in the next five years

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:19.789
it's reasonable to expect that for at least for
a handful of diseases will be to the first step 

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:21.680
in that process

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:28.069
for the last few years stem cell biology have sort have been a
discipline unto itself people have been studying the biology

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:30.969
of these cells and most of the focused 
has been there

00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:37.499
and now what we are going to see is a shift towards a broadening
a shift towards a stratification where

00:02:37.499 --> 00:02:44.499
that technology begins to cuts across classic disciplines
and it's going to be in institutions like Harvard

00:02:45.279 --> 00:02:52.109
where the stem cell science is strong and where the disciplines  
are strong in and of them selfs 

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:56.400
where you're going to see the most effective implementation of those qualities
