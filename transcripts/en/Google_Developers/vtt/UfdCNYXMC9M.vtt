00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.820
Did you know that friends
and family recommendations

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.910
are by far the best way to get
more users for your mobile app?

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:09.900
All you need to do is to make
it super easy for, say, Uncle

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.800
Joe to recommend your
app to his friends,

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.290
and then ensure that
his recommendation can

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:19.280
convert to an actual app install
with just a couple of clicks.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.490
And the best part is, you don't
have to call it from scratch.

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.260
App Invites from Google can
take care of it for you.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.260
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:36.452 --> 00:00:37.970
Hi, I'm Jarek Wilkiewicz.

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:39.830
In this series,
I'm covering things

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:41.350
every developer
needs to understand

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.130
to be successful-- user
acquisition, engagement,

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:45.210
and earning money.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.710
In this episode, we will
focus on user acquisition

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.500
and touch upon user engagement.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.450
In late 2014, Ipsos
conducted a study

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:55.110
to investigate app discovery,
acquisition, usage,

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.390
and abandonment.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.900
8,470 respondents, aged 18 to
64, participated in the study.

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.790
And when asked about how
they became aware of an app,

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.720
52% identified their friends,
family, and colleagues

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.890
as the most trusted source.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:11.970
The same study found
the number one way

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.780
to get the user to install
or use an abandoned app

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.230
again are discount
coupons or credits

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:20.410
towards next purchase, new
content, friends or family

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:24.002
recommendations,
and new features.

00:01:24.002 --> 00:01:24.502
All right.

00:01:24.502 --> 00:01:27.040
So what does this mean
to you as a developer?

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.890
Well, you could try building
an app-sharing functionality

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.860
and post-install onboarding
hooks into your own app

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:33.930
from scratch.

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.620
Or you can integrate
App Invites from Google,

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.420
which is free,
enables app sharing

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.930
using SMS or over email, and
supports personalized user

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.830
onboarding for Android and iOS.

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.580
Let's take a look at an example.

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.570
I used to be a party man,
but that was before the kids.

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.550
Now when my wife and I want to
go out, we need a babysitter.

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.410
The Urban Sitter app
lets me find one.

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:57.340
As you can see in the
demo, Urban Sitter

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.820
knows that I'm likely to
be quite happy with the app

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.350
when I find a babysitter,
so it offers a button

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.570
to share the app with
my friends at checkout.

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.070
The button launches
an App Invites widget,

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:10.840
which automatically suggests
people I'm close to.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.290
I can send the invitation
using email or SMS.

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:15.910
When it arrives in
my friend's inbox,

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.940
the invitation is personalized,
comes from a trusted source--

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.620
me-- and it contains
a discount offer.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.590
Remember, discount offer
increases conversions.

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.570
Urban Sitter takes
advantage of that.

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.290
Upon installation, the recipient
can't resist a discount offer

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:31.970
and signs up for the service.

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.190
Thanks to Urban Sitter and
App Invites from Google,

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.030
my friends can also go out
and enjoy a good party.

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.190
Let's look at another example.

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:41.680
Remember Uncle Joe?

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.960
Turns out he's a
big fan of seafood,

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.550
and so am I. When Uncle
Joe finds a cool paella

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.280
recipe with Yummly, a recipe
app, he can share it with me.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.760
Yummly uses App Invites
for content sharing,

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.440
and the first email
or SMS from Uncle Joe

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.380
will trigger a quick
install process for me.

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.970
Next time, when Uncle Joe shares
a yummy seared scallops recipe

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.570
with me, the email
or SMS from him

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.570
will trigger a
deep link directly

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:10.660
into the Yummly app on my phone.

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.060
As you can tell, even if I'm
not a frequent Yummly user,

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.820
the personalized recommendations
I receive from Uncle Joe

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:18.710
will make me use
the app more often.

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:22.020
This way, App Invites helps
Yummly with user engagement,

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.600
and you can do the
same for your app.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.090
Let's look at some of the
technical details now.

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.530
You can get App Invites
from Google Play services

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:31.950
or CocoaPods.

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.250
The best way to start
is to try the sample app

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:35.170
for your platform.

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:36.580
Let's take a quick look.

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.980
In order to enable App
Invites for your own app,

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.520
go to g.co/AppInvites and follow
the instructions to set up

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:43.690
your project.

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.030
To share app content
deep links, App Invites

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:47.740
provides a widget
out of the box,

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:49.750
so you don't have
to code that part.

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.510
The invite email can be
tailored by your application.

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.600
For example, you can
use a custom image

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.360
and change the invite text.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.500
If you integrate App Invites
into both your Android and iOS

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.360
app, your users will be
able to share app content

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:03.620
cross-platform.

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.596
For example, your Android users
could send the app content

00:04:06.596 --> 00:04:08.970
to their iOS friends, who are
then guided through the app

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.100
install process in
order to view it.

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.230
OK, we've covered
sending invites.

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.940
Let's now talk about
the receiving side.

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.620
Once the user clicks on the
link delivered via SMS or email,

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.529
if the app is not
installed, the user

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:23.600
is taken to the
appropriate store.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.570
Because App Invites is deeply
integrated with Google Play

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:29.210
services, on Android
this process is seamless,

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:31.510
and it doesn't require
browser redirects.

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:34.210
Upon installation, the app can
detect the referred deep link

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.320
using the App Invites
API and act accordingly.

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.820
For example, the deep link
can contain discount coupon

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:42.120
information to make sure
the new user actually

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.490
engages with the app.

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.560
In the Urban Sitter
example, the deep link

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.570
contains the discount code.

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:50.300
App Invites are pre-integrated
with Google Analytics.

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.350
So events such as
sharing and install

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:54.530
are tracked automatically
and visualized

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:56.040
in a handy dashboard.

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.300
You can also report conversions
in your own code using

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.650
the provided API to track key
events, such as the user making

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.654
babysitter reservation
after receiving the invite.

00:05:05.654 --> 00:05:07.820
Monitor conversions in the
provided Google Analytics

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.890
dashboard and slice or dice
the data any way you please.

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:12.730
Pretty cool, huh?

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:14.140
And that's all there is to it.

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:17.620
To learn more, go
to g.co/AppInvites.

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.810
Your uncle is waiting.
