00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.610
So we have this rectangle
right over here,

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.902
and we're told that the
length of AB is equal to 1.

00:00:04.902 --> 00:00:06.360
So that's labeled
right over there.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:07.820
AB is equal to 1.

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:13.440
And then they tell us that
BE and BD trisect angle ABC.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:20.330
So BE and BD trisect angle ABC.

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:26.030
So trisect means dividing
it into 3 equal angles.

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:28.920
So that means that this
angle is equal to this angle

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.242
is equal to that angle.

00:00:30.242 --> 00:00:31.700
And what they want
us to figure out

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.580
is, what is the perimeter
of triangle BED?

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.400
So it's kind of
this middle triangle

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.480
in the rectangle
right over here.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.857
So at first this seems
like a pretty hard problem,

00:00:43.857 --> 00:00:46.440
because you're like well, what
is the width of this rectangle.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.648
How can I even start on this?

00:00:47.648 --> 00:00:49.176
They've only given
us one side here.

00:00:49.176 --> 00:00:51.300
But they've actually given
us a lot of information,

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.390
given that we do know
this is a rectangle.

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.430
We have four sides, and
that we have four angles.

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.640
The sides are all
parallel to each other

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.559
and that the angles
are all 90 degrees.

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:02.100
Which is more than
enough information

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.207
to know that this is
definitely a rectangle.

00:01:04.207 --> 00:01:06.290
And so one thing we do
know is that opposite sides

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.020
of a rectangle are
the same length.

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.410
So if this side is 1, then
this side right over there

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:12.670
is also 1.

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.714
The other thing we know is
that this angle is trisected.

00:01:15.714 --> 00:01:17.630
Now we know what the
measure of this angle is.

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.130
It was a right angle, it
was a 90 degree angle.

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.720
So if it's divided into three
equal parts, that tells us

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.320
that this angle right
over here is 30 degrees,

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.490
this angle right over
here is 30 degrees,

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.230
and then this angle right
over here is 30 degrees.

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:32.730
And then we see
that we're dealing

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:34.700
with a couple of
30-60-90 triangles.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.480
This one is 30, 90, so this
other side right over here

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:39.720
needs to be 60 degrees.

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.900
This triangle right over here,
you have 30, you have 90,

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.030
so this one has
to be 60 degrees.

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.134
They have to add up to
180, 30-60-90 triangle.

00:01:53.134 --> 00:01:55.550
And you can also figure out
the measures of this triangle,

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.180
although it's not going
to be a right triangle.

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.810
But knowing what we know
about 30-60-90 triangles,

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.440
if we just have
one side of them,

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.650
we can actually figure
out the other sides.

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.060
So for example, here we
have the shortest side.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.800
We have the side opposite
of the 30 degree side.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.680
Now, if the 30 degree side
is 1, then the 60 degree side

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.940
is going to be square
root of 3 times that.

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.480
So this length
right over here is

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.870
going to be square root of 3.

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.290
And that's pretty useful
because we now just figured out

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.600
the length of the entire
base of this rectangle

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:27.480
right over there.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.380
And we just used our knowledge
of 30-60-90 triangles.

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.040
If that was a little
bit mysterious,

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.540
how I came up with
that, I encourage

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:34.620
you to watch that video.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:40.900
We know that 30-60-90
triangles, their sides

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.530
are in the ratio of 1 to
square root of 3 to 2.

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.090
So this is 1, this
is a 30 degree side,

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.150
this is going to be square
root of 3 times that.

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:51.570
And the hypotenuse
right over here

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.200
is going to be 2 times that.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.620
So this length
right over here is

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.180
going to be 2 times this
side right over here.

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.292
So 2 times 1 is just 2.

00:03:00.292 --> 00:03:01.500
So that's pretty interesting.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.166
Let's see if we can
do something similar

00:03:03.166 --> 00:03:04.520
with this side right over here.

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.770
Here the 1 is not the side
opposite the 30 degree side.

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.650
Here the 1 is the side
opposite the 60 degree side.

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.780
So once again, if we
multiply this side

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.410
times square root of 3, we
should get this side right over

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.930
here.

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:27.650
This is the 60, remember this
1, this is the 60 degree side.

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.290
So this has to be 1 square
root of 3 of this side.

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.300
Let me write this down, 1
over the square root of 3.

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.280
And the whole reason, the
way I was able to get this

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.140
is, well, whatever this
side, if I multiply it

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.680
by the square root of 3, I
should get this side right over

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:44.040
here.

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.748
I should get the 60
degree side, the side

00:03:45.748 --> 00:03:47.350
opposite the 60 degree angle.

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.360
Or if I take the 60 degree
side, if I divide it

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.420
by the square root of 3 I should
get the shortest side, the 30

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:54.330
degree side.

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.630
So if I start with the
60 degree side, divide

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.580
by the square root of 3, I
get that right over there.

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.280
And then the
hypotenuse is always

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:06.949
going to be twice the side
opposite the 30 degree angle.

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:08.990
So this is the side opposite
the 30 degree angle.

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:11.170
The hypotenuse is
always twice that.

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.240
So this is the side opposite
the 30 degree angle.

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.110
The hypotenuse is
going to be twice that.

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:18.816
It is going to be 2 over
the square root of 3.

00:04:18.816 --> 00:04:19.940
So we're doing pretty good.

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:21.140
We have to figure
out the perimeter

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:22.800
of this inner triangle
right over here.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.780
We already figured
out one length is 2.

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.290
We figured out another length
is 2 square roots of 3.

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:30.614
And then all we have to really
figure out is, what ED is.

00:04:30.614 --> 00:04:32.030
And we can do that
because we know

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:35.390
that AD is going to be
the same thing as BC.

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:37.560
We know that this entire
length, because we're

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.670
dealing with a rectangle,
is the square root of 3.

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:43.420
If that entire length
is square root of 3,

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:47.420
if this AE is 1 over
the square root of 3,

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:48.840
then this length
right over here,

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.310
ED is going to be
square root of 3 minus 1

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:53.740
over the square root of 3.

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.425
That length minus that
length right over there.

00:04:56.425 --> 00:04:58.800
And how to find the perimeter
is pretty straight forward.

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.220
We just have to add these
things up and simplify it.

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:04.440
So it's going to be,
just let me write

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:09.890
this, perimeter
of triangle BED is

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:11.730
equal to-- This is
short for perimeter.

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:13.990
I just didn't feel like
writing the whole word.--

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:19.920
is equal to 2 over the square
root of 3 plus square root of 3

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:26.990
minus 1 over the square
root of 3 plus 2.

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:29.400
And now this just boils down
to simplifying radicals.

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.024
You could take a
calculator out and get

00:05:31.024 --> 00:05:32.891
some type of decimal
approximation for it.

00:05:32.891 --> 00:05:35.390
Let's see, if we have 2 square
root of 3 minus 1 square root

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:39.800
of 3, that will leave us with
1 over the square root of 3.

00:05:42.467 --> 00:05:44.800
2 over the square of 3 minus
1 over the square root of 3

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.330
is 1 over the square root of 3.

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:50.730
And then you have the
square root of 3 plus 2.

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:52.782
And let's see, I can
rationalize this.

00:05:52.782 --> 00:05:54.740
If I multiply the numerator
and the denominator

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:57.640
by the square root of 3,
this gives me the square root

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:01.400
of 3 over 3 plus the
square root of 3,

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:04.640
which I could rewrite
that as plus 3

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:06.490
square roots of 3 over 3.

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:06.990
Right?

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:12.350
I just multiplied this
times 3 over 3 plus 2.

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:16.410
And so this gives us-- this
is the drum roll part now-- so

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:19.480
one square root of 3
plus 3 square roots of 3,

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:24.890
and all of that over 3, gives
us 4 square roots of 3 over 3

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:26.012
plus 2.

00:06:26.012 --> 00:06:27.220
Or you could put the 2 first.

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:30.080
Some people like to write
the non-irrational part

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.535
before the irrational part.

00:06:31.535 --> 00:06:32.160
But we're done.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:33.800
We figured out the perimeter.

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:38.400
We figured out the perimeter
of this inner triangle BED,

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.220
right there.
