00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.636
I wanna watch you murder
your family in your pool.

00:00:02.636 --> 00:00:05.405
And you're all, "Yeah, cool,
do you want it tonight or what?

00:00:05.405 --> 00:00:07.274
Is Thursday good for you?"

00:00:07.274 --> 00:00:10.210
"Yeah, I want to bathe
in the blood of your children"

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:12.112
She goes,
"I can arrange that, babe.

00:00:12.112 --> 00:00:14.114
Is that what you're into?"

00:00:14.114 --> 00:00:16.583
She goes, "I would totally suck
your dick if you went home

00:00:16.583 --> 00:00:18.285
and fist fought your mom."

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:24.958
Whitey Ford, himself,
from the House of Pain;

00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:27.427
Everlast is gonna be
coming in the studio with us

00:00:27.427 --> 00:00:28.695
which is very, very exciting.

00:00:28.695 --> 00:00:31.565
Didn't feel a pop in the room
when I said it, but alright.

00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:35.369
Would you want us all
to start hitting each other?

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:37.704
We all know it.
We all know who's coming.

00:00:37.704 --> 00:00:39.640
Yeah, yeah. You should have
maybe not told us, also.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.074
Yeah, really. We've been
talking about it

00:00:41.074 --> 00:00:42.309
for hours on this thing.

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:43.610
The camera people
didn't do anything.

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:44.845
Yeah.

00:00:44.845 --> 00:00:46.346
White Lou who I know
is exploding

00:00:46.346 --> 00:00:48.415
with excitement for this.

00:00:48.415 --> 00:00:50.117
Did he want to 'jump around'?

00:00:51.118 --> 00:00:53.153
You dick. You son of a bitch.

00:00:53.153 --> 00:00:54.554
Then maybe if you delayed it

00:00:54.554 --> 00:00:59.326
then you would know
what it's like.

00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:09.069
Bro, Everlast did this freestyle
on a Ice Cube compilation album

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:11.605
in the 80's
that I'm dying to ask him about.

00:01:11.605 --> 00:01:12.839
Yeah?

00:01:12.839 --> 00:01:14.741
Syndicate? When he was
part of Syndicate?

00:01:14.741 --> 00:01:16.043
Oh my god, I'm so sorry.

00:01:16.043 --> 00:01:17.611
That's exactly what
I've been looking for

00:01:17.611 --> 00:01:19.046
my fucking entire life.

00:01:19.046 --> 00:01:20.480
Yeah.
Yeah, the Syndicate.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:21.715
Jay's deep knowledge
of Everlast.

00:01:21.715 --> 00:01:22.916
Are you being serious?

00:01:22.916 --> 00:01:24.384
C'mon man, that's not even-

00:01:24.384 --> 00:01:27.487
that's Ice-T
background shit, too.

00:01:27.487 --> 00:01:29.356
But what is that song?
Do you remember-

00:01:29.356 --> 00:01:31.391
I don't.

00:01:31.391 --> 00:01:34.594
Everlast's rhyme on that was
my favorite.

00:01:34.594 --> 00:01:35.829
It's towards the end.

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:37.164
Is this it here?
Is this the Syndicate?

00:01:37.164 --> 00:01:38.865
Yep.

00:01:39.533 --> 00:01:40.834
Everlast had a long ponytail?

00:01:40.834 --> 00:01:42.069
No.

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:44.671
I thought he just had hair.
Just had hair.

00:01:44.671 --> 00:01:47.240
It's just hair, bro.
Oh, there it is.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.542
Dude, I remember
listening to this

00:01:48.542 --> 00:01:50.711
in the back of a jeep
in Clearwater, Florida.

00:01:50.711 --> 00:01:52.079
Hey.
High as fuck.

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.413
Do we get to the Everlast part?

00:01:53.413 --> 00:01:55.449
Yeah, it's toward the end
I think.

00:01:55.449 --> 00:01:56.750
Go Boca Wildcats.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:57.951
Or Bobcats, Dan.

00:01:57.951 --> 00:01:59.786
God damn it, I knew I blew it.

00:02:00.854 --> 00:02:02.155
That's three bear crawls
for you.

00:02:02.155 --> 00:02:03.657
Okay, back it up, back it up.
Here we go.

00:02:03.657 --> 00:02:04.891
I'm curious to hear
what he sounds like

00:02:04.891 --> 00:02:07.561
a little bit younger, too.
Pretty cool still.

00:02:07.561 --> 00:02:09.663
We've got ten minutes,
we've got to put this together.

00:02:09.663 --> 00:02:10.964
Yeah, it's almost put together.

00:02:10.964 --> 00:02:13.700
I just don't know if it'll be
funny if - give him a break,

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.536
cause they said he's been
going around playing music

00:02:16.536 --> 00:02:18.238
on all these shows,
having to sing his songs.

00:02:18.238 --> 00:02:19.473
Do you think he'll play?

00:02:19.473 --> 00:02:21.274
And we have
an acoustic guitar here.

00:02:23.076 --> 00:02:25.746
I'll just be playing it
on accident, and then be like oh

00:02:25.746 --> 00:02:27.581
I didn't know you were gonna
be here, oh maybe you can play.

00:02:27.581 --> 00:02:28.882
Well we don't want to hammer him
with it

00:02:28.882 --> 00:02:31.685
when Susie walks in, but ...

00:02:31.685 --> 00:02:32.886
Maybe just have Bert hold -

00:02:32.886 --> 00:02:34.388
You can be holding
the whole time and go

00:02:34.388 --> 00:02:35.856
"Oh I brought my guitar
if you want."

00:02:35.856 --> 00:02:37.591
Yeah, do you wanna
take your shirt off already?

00:02:37.591 --> 00:02:39.192
And so you have your shirt off
and the guitar on,

00:02:39.192 --> 00:02:41.762
so it's like you
just been fuckin' wailin'.

00:02:42.596 --> 00:02:46.500
This is Bert, he's been hittin'
some tasty licks.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.734
Tasty licks?

00:02:47.734 --> 00:02:49.703
I've just been shredding'
in the corner

00:02:49.703 --> 00:02:51.104
of the fucking studio.

00:02:51.104 --> 00:02:53.173
Yeah, yeah I'm into that.
Whatever you need -

00:02:53.173 --> 00:02:54.674
We're just gonna talk to him
for a while

00:02:54.674 --> 00:02:55.976
and have like
a nice conversation.

00:02:55.976 --> 00:02:57.511
Everyone would be-

00:02:57.511 --> 00:02:59.112
You have to have questions
for Everlast.

00:02:59.112 --> 00:03:00.313
There's no way
you don't, right?

00:03:00.313 --> 00:03:02.282
Okay, yeah, what was it
like scoring

00:03:02.282 --> 00:03:03.483
Judgment Night?

00:03:03.483 --> 00:03:04.918
Remember when you got
Judgment Night,

00:03:04.918 --> 00:03:06.720
you wanna tell me
what it's like?

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.488
Was he in Judgment Night?

00:03:09.322 --> 00:03:10.524
I think he was
in Judgment Night.

00:03:10.524 --> 00:03:12.092
I think he threw Jeremy Piven
off a building.

00:03:12.092 --> 00:03:13.326
He's one of the guys
that did, yes.

00:03:13.326 --> 00:03:14.728
I'm gonna ask who he was
in Judgment Night.

00:03:14.728 --> 00:03:15.962
Bro, can I tell you?

00:03:15.962 --> 00:03:17.164
He was one of
Denis Leary's crew!

00:03:17.164 --> 00:03:18.398
You're Denis Leary's crew.

00:03:18.398 --> 00:03:19.666
Don't ever come back ...

00:03:19.666 --> 00:03:21.668
And the fucking best song,
'House of Pain' and 'Helmets',

00:03:21.668 --> 00:03:22.903
the best song
on that soundtrack.

00:03:22.903 --> 00:03:25.806
I'm sorry, I love that song,
please pull that up, oh my god.

00:03:25.806 --> 00:03:27.507
I am the biggest
Everlast fan in the world.

00:03:27.507 --> 00:03:30.110
"Just another victim, kid!"
It's the best.

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.712
Dude, I, his, like -

00:03:32.712 --> 00:03:34.614
We'll play it when we come back
from break, actually.

00:03:34.614 --> 00:03:36.083
Let's play it when we
come back from break.

00:03:36.083 --> 00:03:37.284
Oh is this it?

00:03:37.284 --> 00:03:38.618
Yeah. That's
Helmet House of Pain.

00:03:38.618 --> 00:03:40.353
Oh shit, here he is right here!
Just kidding guys-

00:03:40.353 --> 00:03:41.688
Oh dude!

00:03:41.688 --> 00:03:43.390
By the way Jacob
should've walked in and gone

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:44.758
"Suck my dick assholes!"

00:03:44.758 --> 00:03:46.693
"Suck my dick assholes"

00:03:46.693 --> 00:03:47.961
"You know what else
is everlasting?

00:03:47.961 --> 00:03:50.097
My balls in your mom's mouth"

00:03:50.097 --> 00:03:52.499
What if we just played
Everlong the entire time?

00:03:52.499 --> 00:03:54.801
Dude, I was saying
we should play

00:03:54.801 --> 00:03:56.670
Everclear every time
we come back.

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.072
"Bam, bam, bam, bam,
father of mine".

00:04:00.273 --> 00:04:02.609
Can we get the thing before
we have to go to break again.

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:04.411
Just saying what I think
it would be funny to do.

00:04:04.411 --> 00:04:05.679
If we can get him-

00:04:05.679 --> 00:04:06.913
If we can get him to do it.

00:04:06.913 --> 00:04:09.282
If he will agree
to play the song 'What

00:04:09.282 --> 00:04:12.452
It's Like', it'll be so funny
if we all take turns,

00:04:12.452 --> 00:04:15.155
try to keep a straight face
and singing a verse of it.

00:04:15.655 --> 00:04:17.324
But like,
singing about whatever.

00:04:17.324 --> 00:04:18.859
I just don't wanna do the thing
we were doing

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:20.293
when Bert first came in.

00:04:20.293 --> 00:04:26.800
If we all take turns going
(mumbling)

00:04:27.467 --> 00:04:30.270
But we were at this, the verse
where he goes what is it-

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.172
someone got- what's her name?

00:04:32.172 --> 00:04:33.440
I don't know,
we kept doing Jacob.

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.275
Something that pra- yeah.

00:04:35.275 --> 00:04:37.978
"pranking from a kid
name Thompson use love"

00:04:37.978 --> 00:04:42.449
(singing)

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:44.618
Mike, can you hand
Bert the guitar

00:04:44.618 --> 00:04:48.388
so we can do what we were doing
when Bert first came in?

00:04:48.388 --> 00:04:51.658
(singing)

00:04:51.658 --> 00:04:53.426
(singing)

00:04:53.426 --> 00:04:56.563
Jacob got a producing job,
said you's in love.

00:04:57.664 --> 00:04:59.666
He said, "Don't worry about
that shark tooth,

00:04:59.666 --> 00:05:02.035
I'm the man
you've been dreaming of."

00:05:02.035 --> 00:05:04.638
(singing)
met himself a girl,

00:05:04.638 --> 00:05:06.406
didn't know she was a whore.

00:05:06.406 --> 00:05:07.874
But wait-

00:05:07.874 --> 00:05:10.844
Watch that sixty dollars
go out the door.

00:05:11.545 --> 00:05:13.346
(singing)

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:16.216
I think we might be
borderlining- if someone's like,

00:05:16.216 --> 00:05:17.551
"Hey do an impression of Bert."

00:05:17.551 --> 00:05:19.519
They're like, "I'm a drunk
idiot, I take my shirt off."

00:05:19.519 --> 00:05:21.121
That's what I'm wondering,
cause it's like a shitty Tom

00:05:21.121 --> 00:05:22.322
Waits.

00:05:22.322 --> 00:05:25.125
I would not do of him to
himself.

00:05:25.125 --> 00:05:27.127
Yeah, you go like this;
"You wanna hear my Dan Soder?"

00:05:27.127 --> 00:05:28.929
(mumbling)

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:32.532
Hey, Rogan. Let me show me
my impression of you.

00:05:33.667 --> 00:05:34.868
(screaming)

00:05:34.868 --> 00:05:36.436
That's horrible,
I could tell, too.

00:05:36.436 --> 00:05:37.804
Are you guys saying
I don't sound like

00:05:37.804 --> 00:05:39.039
Everlast when I'm doing that?

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:40.307
No, not at all.

00:05:40.307 --> 00:05:41.975
You don't sound like it.

00:05:41.975 --> 00:05:43.210
(mumbling)

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:44.511
Then I'm not gonna ask him
to do it, then.

00:05:44.511 --> 00:05:45.812
Well, can we ...

00:05:45.812 --> 00:05:47.514
You guys have your own
radio fun, then.

00:05:47.514 --> 00:05:50.483
You let me sit on that
as a great idea for ours.

00:05:50.483 --> 00:05:52.919
Well, then you also get
other chefs in the kitchen

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:54.421
to realize it's maybe
not the best idea

00:05:54.421 --> 00:05:56.089
to do an impression
to someone's face.

00:05:56.089 --> 00:05:59.693
Maybe Bert bullied you.
I think so.

00:05:59.693 --> 00:06:02.095
I just think if you-

00:06:02.095 --> 00:06:03.863
He's got a good point.

00:06:03.863 --> 00:06:06.399
Imagine if you sound like that.
I think that's what blackface-

00:06:06.399 --> 00:06:09.569
the problem they have
with blackface.

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:11.671
This is what we think you look
like, and people are like,

00:06:11.671 --> 00:06:13.673
"Hey, that's not
what we look like."

00:06:13.673 --> 00:06:15.342
So don't soft shoe either.

00:06:15.342 --> 00:06:18.144
You know girl, when you stop
jumping around

00:06:18.144 --> 00:06:19.946
it makes me feel all-

00:06:19.946 --> 00:06:21.715
I'm the creepy crab.

00:06:21.715 --> 00:06:23.850
(singing)
rise to the top.

00:06:28.121 --> 00:06:30.023
(mumbling)

00:06:31.725 --> 00:06:33.393
It sounds like we're just
doing Tom Waits.

00:06:33.393 --> 00:06:35.795
(mumbling)

00:06:35.795 --> 00:06:39.299
And I hoped I don't fall
in love with you.

00:06:39.299 --> 00:06:40.567
Really should break, brother.

00:06:40.567 --> 00:06:41.835
You should break, bro.

00:06:41.835 --> 00:06:44.037
Alright, we'll break brother.
We'll break brother.

00:06:44.037 --> 00:06:45.338
Alright brother.

00:06:45.338 --> 00:06:48.341
Brother. I'll break anything,
except bread with a Jew.

00:06:48.341 --> 00:06:49.542
Woah.
Whoa.

00:06:49.542 --> 00:06:51.411
Whoa.

00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:54.114
I bet you turned on that.
Let's do it.

00:06:54.114 --> 00:06:55.815
I gave Lou every opportunity.

00:06:56.916 --> 00:06:58.385
Sometimes we think
we're gonna take a break

00:06:58.385 --> 00:07:01.254
and then we find out our guest
only as very, very limited time-

00:07:01.254 --> 00:07:04.891
Yeah, so we actually probably
could've just played

00:07:04.891 --> 00:07:06.660
that song for him,
he's in the hallway.

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:07.894
Yeah?
Yeah.

00:07:07.894 --> 00:07:09.095
We could've.

00:07:09.095 --> 00:07:14.034
Oh shit. Oh shit. Oh shit.
Oh shit.

00:07:14.834 --> 00:07:16.970
First thing, you walk in, black
Lou makes you fill out forms.

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:19.172
He goes, "You mind signing away
some stuff?

00:07:19.172 --> 00:07:21.608
We've got a non-compete waiver."
How ya doing?

00:07:21.608 --> 00:07:23.310
That's my children and my soul.

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:25.145
Yeah, come on in man.
Welcome.

00:07:25.145 --> 00:07:28.548
Everybody, Everlast joins us
on The Bonfire.

00:07:28.548 --> 00:07:29.849
Fuck yeah, man.

00:07:29.849 --> 00:07:31.084
This is great.

00:07:31.084 --> 00:07:33.787
They never give us cool guests,
this is the best.

00:07:33.787 --> 00:07:36.656
Oh, yeah, they told me
I gotta pop in, and I was like,

00:07:36.656 --> 00:07:38.358
"I'm literally on my way
to the airport,"

00:07:38.358 --> 00:07:40.894
but I was like,
"I'm not just gonna flake."

00:07:40.894 --> 00:07:42.329
Let's go.

00:07:42.329 --> 00:07:43.930
Then we would've been-
Jay would've been destroyed.

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:45.031
Heartbroken.

00:07:46.666 --> 00:07:47.834
You want a drink?

00:07:47.834 --> 00:07:51.638
Oh, hell no. Hell no,
I'm about to get on a plane.

00:07:51.638 --> 00:07:55.408
This is exciting for me also
because less than a year ago,

00:07:56.376 --> 00:07:58.011
at a Deli by my house,

00:07:58.011 --> 00:08:02.148
a month after I saw you perform
House of Pain at Irving Plaza,

00:08:03.049 --> 00:08:05.285
I bumped into you at a Deli
and told you that on my radio

00:08:05.285 --> 00:08:07.487
I said on my radio show,

00:08:07.487 --> 00:08:11.057
we voted you the cooled white
boy in all of white boydom.

00:08:11.057 --> 00:08:12.959
Yeah, we shook hands.
I was certain after you left,

00:08:12.959 --> 00:08:15.028
because I said to my girlfriend
who was with me at the time too,

00:08:15.028 --> 00:08:17.530
Christina over there,
I did say, I go,

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:18.965
"I was just any one
of those guys now

00:08:18.965 --> 00:08:21.501
who just did that thing.
Hey, here's how me

00:08:21.501 --> 00:08:24.003
and you are related
in some weird way, anyway."

00:08:25.105 --> 00:08:27.607
You also did a weird fringe
thing where you go,

00:08:27.607 --> 00:08:30.076
"I got a radio show
and I voted you something."

00:08:30.076 --> 00:08:31.511
And they're like,
"I'm gonna die here."

00:08:31.511 --> 00:08:33.747
And then I think I listed
some of my TV credits.

00:08:33.747 --> 00:08:35.415
It was not a good look.

00:08:35.415 --> 00:08:37.851
I was on Comedy Central,
I was on IFC.

00:08:37.851 --> 00:08:39.853
I was in flip-flops and socks,
man, I didn't know how to react.

00:08:39.853 --> 00:08:41.554
I didn't know I was gonna
bump into Everlast.

00:08:41.554 --> 00:08:42.989
Does that happen when
you're out getting food,

00:08:42.989 --> 00:08:45.625
do people just look at you like,
"Oh, shit, hey!"

00:08:45.625 --> 00:08:48.395
It depends if I've got my
'fuck you' face on or not.

00:08:48.395 --> 00:08:49.696
Yeah, hell yeah.

00:08:49.696 --> 00:08:50.964
You try to keep it on sometimes?

00:08:50.964 --> 00:08:52.866
A lot, a lot, yeah. A lot.

00:08:52.866 --> 00:08:54.834
So what's the thing that people
can say to you

00:08:54.834 --> 00:08:57.370
that hits where you go,
"Oh you're a legit fan."

00:08:57.937 --> 00:09:01.341
Where you go- some guy
just mentioned my new special,

00:09:01.341 --> 00:09:02.609
one of the jokes.

00:09:02.609 --> 00:09:05.045
If I say that, at least
whoever's listening to your show

00:09:05.045 --> 00:09:08.014
is gonna use it
every time they see me.

00:09:08.014 --> 00:09:09.282
These are good people.

00:09:09.282 --> 00:09:10.717
If I approached you
at the airport, I'd be like,

00:09:10.717 --> 00:09:12.018
"Judgment Night
changed my life."

00:09:12.018 --> 00:09:15.221
Yep. Here we go, this is mine,
Syndicate. The Syndicate.

00:09:15.221 --> 00:09:16.689
I'd say the movie
or the soundtrack?

00:09:16.689 --> 00:09:17.957
Soundtrack.

00:09:17.957 --> 00:09:19.492
Syndicate, with Ice Cube.

00:09:19.492 --> 00:09:20.794
Ice T.
Ice T, sorry.

00:09:20.794 --> 00:09:22.328
Yeah, he signed me
to my first deal.

00:09:22.328 --> 00:09:23.763
That would let me know
you've been rocking

00:09:23.763 --> 00:09:24.998
for a while for sure.

00:09:24.998 --> 00:09:26.232
Alright.

00:09:26.232 --> 00:09:28.034
It makes me so angry he
stole that from me.

00:09:29.469 --> 00:09:31.171
Joe Rogan acoustic.

00:09:31.771 --> 00:09:34.240
When you did that,
that's a fucking badass-

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:36.075
Yeah, I was the first one
to do any music on it.

00:09:36.075 --> 00:09:37.444
I don't know
if a lot of people still do.

00:09:37.444 --> 00:09:39.646
I know one or two other bands
that went on Joe's.

00:09:39.646 --> 00:09:40.880
I'm about to go hit
Joe's show.

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:42.615
Were you guys are
the Irving Plaza

00:09:42.615 --> 00:09:44.751
where I was singing every
word up in the balcony.

00:09:44.751 --> 00:09:46.219
Oh, you guys were probably
too busy eating cereal

00:09:46.219 --> 00:09:47.487
and playing video games
or something.

00:09:47.487 --> 00:09:48.755
Oh, cool, I don't know but-

00:09:48.755 --> 00:09:49.989
While you guys were probably

00:09:49.989 --> 00:09:51.858
Tough Mudder training
or something.

00:09:51.858 --> 00:09:53.526
While I was over there
fucking white boy

00:09:53.526 --> 00:09:54.894
rapping it up
in the balcony.

00:09:54.894 --> 00:09:56.763
Do you realize that you're
giving in more to the myth

00:09:56.763 --> 00:09:58.198
that you're the psycho fan
that's like,

00:09:58.198 --> 00:09:59.432
"I voted you the best person,

00:09:59.432 --> 00:10:01.434
I was up
in the top of the theater

00:10:01.434 --> 00:10:02.902
mouthing along
every word with you."

00:10:02.902 --> 00:10:04.704
I waited for the backstage door
for three hours,

00:10:04.704 --> 00:10:06.139
you never came out.

00:10:06.139 --> 00:10:07.841
I had a Father's Day card
for you.

00:10:09.075 --> 00:10:10.877
I totally- like your face-

00:10:10.877 --> 00:10:12.345
I don't remember
any of the other stuff-

00:10:12.345 --> 00:10:13.580
It's fair.

00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:15.315
-but I was looking at you like,
"Man, I fucking know this guy

00:10:15.315 --> 00:10:16.716
I think."
That makes sense.

00:10:16.716 --> 00:10:18.785
Want me to list
my TV appearances again?

00:10:18.785 --> 00:10:20.186
That's what you said
in the Deli,

00:10:20.186 --> 00:10:22.155
I started listing off
what I could've been from.

00:10:22.155 --> 00:10:24.023
Well maybe you've seen
my Netflix this,

00:10:24.023 --> 00:10:25.458
or Comedy Central that.

00:10:25.458 --> 00:10:27.694
I was probably high if I was
walking into a Bodega.

00:10:27.694 --> 00:10:30.063
I was probably looking
for a sandwich or something.

00:10:30.063 --> 00:10:31.598
Yeah, Bodega sandwiches
are great.

00:10:31.598 --> 00:10:32.899
No, that's what it was-

00:10:32.899 --> 00:10:34.200
Only in New York,

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:36.736
I won't eat a bodega sandwich
anywhere else in the world.

00:10:36.736 --> 00:10:39.639
A nice target ham sandwich
in fucking Dayton.

00:10:39.639 --> 00:10:41.941
I'm not walking into
a shitty deli in Paris

00:10:41.941 --> 00:10:43.209
and ordering something

00:10:43.209 --> 00:10:44.944
on a hero.
I'm just not trusting.

00:10:44.944 --> 00:10:47.747
Yeah, Boar's
Head is what sells me.

00:10:47.747 --> 00:10:50.650
You were getting a sandwich,
that's how I had you hostage.

00:10:52.185 --> 00:10:54.120
You were probably high
and you probably were waiting.

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:55.355
You were waiting it out,
he goes,

00:10:55.355 --> 00:10:57.090
"Do I talk to the fat
annoying idiot

00:10:57.090 --> 00:10:59.692
who's wearing a tank
top comfortably?"

00:11:01.561 --> 00:11:03.029
The biggest psycho move
would've been

00:11:03.029 --> 00:11:05.431
if you finished
the sandwich order for him,

00:11:05.965 --> 00:11:08.101
and you go,
"He also likes regular mustard.

00:11:09.269 --> 00:11:10.770
I need to back
the fuck outta here."

00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:14.007
He goes, "No salt.
Your blood pressure." Excuse me?

00:11:14.007 --> 00:11:15.341
I was at the doctor's office,

00:11:15.341 --> 00:11:17.243
I tried to talk to you
then, too.

00:11:17.243 --> 00:11:19.612
Hey, where did the name
Everlast come from?

00:11:19.612 --> 00:11:21.347
As a fan since I've been a kid.

00:11:22.382 --> 00:11:26.786
I used to be- originally
when I first started rapping

00:11:26.786 --> 00:11:28.955
I would call myself E-Rocky,

00:11:28.955 --> 00:11:30.723
which was Eric Rocks
Everlasting.

00:11:31.558 --> 00:11:33.526
I just chopped that shit.

00:11:33.526 --> 00:11:34.827
Right to Everlast.

00:11:34.827 --> 00:11:36.062
To Everlast.

00:11:36.062 --> 00:11:37.797
I'm such a huge fan
for such a long time.

00:11:37.797 --> 00:11:39.032
Such a long fucking time.

00:11:39.032 --> 00:11:41.768
Since I was eight-
seventeen years old. Seventeen.

00:11:42.835 --> 00:11:45.338
I know 'Jump Around' is probably
to some degree

00:11:45.338 --> 00:11:47.140
the bane of your existence
in many ways,

00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:49.676
but I mean I've heard
it go different ways.

00:11:49.676 --> 00:11:51.811
John Popper told me
from blue's traveler

00:11:51.811 --> 00:11:56.950
that he'll play the
runaround song whenever
anyone even asked him

00:11:56.950 --> 00:11:58.484
to play it on the street
because he's like,

00:11:58.484 --> 00:12:00.853
"That bought me
everything I've ever had."

00:12:00.853 --> 00:12:02.589
So people don't run
from it at all.

00:12:02.589 --> 00:12:04.123
The only time 'Jump Around'
was a problem to me

00:12:04.123 --> 00:12:05.391
was when first released

00:12:05.391 --> 00:12:07.327
'Whitey Ford Sings the Blues'
I put it away.

00:12:07.327 --> 00:12:08.561
Right.

00:12:08.561 --> 00:12:09.829
And I wouldn't do it

00:12:09.829 --> 00:12:12.231
for probably about
two or three years.

00:12:12.231 --> 00:12:14.434
And you do acoustic versions
of it which is awesome too.

00:12:14.434 --> 00:12:16.869
Yeah, that was a few years back.

00:12:16.869 --> 00:12:19.906
I did an acoustic album,
I just was like fuck it,

00:12:19.906 --> 00:12:21.507
I'll do it
before some hipster does.

00:12:21.507 --> 00:12:23.943
Yeah, you just bummed out
a barista in Williamsburg,

00:12:23.943 --> 00:12:25.178
where he goes,

00:12:25.178 --> 00:12:27.747
"Remember the idea I told you
about where I was gonna do 'Jump

00:12:27.747 --> 00:12:29.048
Around' acoustic?
Well he did it."

00:12:29.048 --> 00:12:30.283
I ruined that for him.

00:12:30.283 --> 00:12:32.885
Yeah. Dude, he kitted
furiously that evening.

00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:36.255
Can I ask you a- you don't
have to answer this, just-

00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:39.092
there are some lines
you leave out

00:12:39.092 --> 00:12:40.727
when you do
the acoustic version.

00:12:40.727 --> 00:12:42.228
I own the album.
Why did you leave them out?

00:12:42.228 --> 00:12:43.496
There is?

00:12:43.496 --> 00:12:44.697
Yeah.

00:12:44.697 --> 00:12:46.666
Maybe I'm old and I forgot
a couple words or something.

00:12:46.666 --> 00:12:49.369
Everlast, this is how we
approach you about having CTE.

00:12:49.369 --> 00:12:51.704
How many hard hits
to the head did you take?

00:12:51.704 --> 00:12:55.308
I love- I bought the album,
I love it. I watch you live.

00:12:55.308 --> 00:12:57.443
Now you're gonna make me
fucking listen to it.

00:12:57.443 --> 00:12:58.745
What lyrics did I forget?

00:12:58.745 --> 00:13:00.046
I'm just trying to get you
to play it,

00:13:00.046 --> 00:13:01.748
to be quite honest with you.

00:13:02.415 --> 00:13:04.083
We have a guitar right there, we
have a camera set up.

00:13:04.083 --> 00:13:07.086
If you can play it, I swear
to god I'll get totally naked.

00:13:07.086 --> 00:13:08.755
Whatever you want, I'll do.

00:13:09.455 --> 00:13:11.891
You just guaranteed
it's not happening man.

00:13:12.692 --> 00:13:14.794
Keep my clothes on.

00:13:14.794 --> 00:13:18.097
Bert, no one's gonna accuse
you of being a good vibe reader.

00:13:18.097 --> 00:13:20.066
Nothing about me thought-
first off, he goes,

00:13:20.066 --> 00:13:22.135
I'll do whatever you want,
I'll get naked.

00:13:22.135 --> 00:13:23.369
I'll suck your dick.

00:13:23.369 --> 00:13:25.571
I'll give you my entire
collection of gay pornography.

00:13:25.571 --> 00:13:27.907
Are any of these things
striking your fancy?

00:13:27.907 --> 00:13:29.876
He goes, "You play this song,
I'll murder an enemy of yours.

00:13:29.876 --> 00:13:31.277
Choose the enemy,
I will track him down.

00:13:31.277 --> 00:13:32.545
I will find him."

00:13:32.545 --> 00:13:34.681
Oh man, I gotta start
listening to this show, man.

00:13:34.681 --> 00:13:36.582
It gets weird.

00:13:36.582 --> 00:13:38.418
When Comedy Central finds out
what we're actually doing,

00:13:38.418 --> 00:13:39.619
they're gonna fire us.

00:13:39.619 --> 00:13:41.120
That's why the camera
started going up.

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:43.189
Dude, we are legit
fucking fans of yours.

00:13:43.923 --> 00:13:47.727
I'm not even joking, we're all
really successful people,

00:13:47.727 --> 00:13:48.995
but we fucking love you.

00:13:48.995 --> 00:13:51.864
I have a Netflix
special out right now,

00:13:51.864 --> 00:13:53.700
I'm really fucking big.

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:55.535
Dude, I'm fucking obsessed.
I'm friends with Joe.

00:13:55.535 --> 00:13:56.869
I go on his podcast
more than you.

00:13:56.869 --> 00:13:58.071
I fucking love you.

00:13:58.071 --> 00:13:59.305
I seen you with the belly
in the picture.

00:13:59.305 --> 00:14:00.506
I seen it.

00:14:00.506 --> 00:14:01.741
Yeah, he recognized you Bert.

00:14:01.741 --> 00:14:03.009
You wanna get fucking naked?

00:14:03.009 --> 00:14:04.210
I told you
I'd get fucking naked.

00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:05.445
I know who you are dude,

00:14:05.445 --> 00:14:07.880
I'm saying I need
to listen to this show.

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:10.049
Bring out the fucking Tito.

00:14:10.049 --> 00:14:15.221
Hit the vape pen.
I can't fix my headsets.

00:14:15.221 --> 00:14:17.090
That might be my favorite
explosion ever on the show.

00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:21.494
A completely positive meltdown.

00:14:22.729 --> 00:14:24.731
That was like a positive
Brian Dawkins speech.

00:14:24.731 --> 00:14:26.766
He's like,
"This is what we do.

00:14:27.567 --> 00:14:29.902
This is what we do,
and god dammit I love you."

00:14:30.570 --> 00:14:33.473
That's how I started to feel
in the deli when he goes,

00:14:33.473 --> 00:14:34.807
"Your face looks
familiar to me,"

00:14:34.807 --> 00:14:36.809
and I went, "Here's
everything I did," he was like,

00:14:36.809 --> 00:14:38.644
"I don't think
it's any of those things.

00:14:38.644 --> 00:14:42.281
I'm gonna be outside eating
this gluten free coconut ball."

00:14:43.282 --> 00:14:45.017
Enjoy your sandwich, sir.

00:14:45.017 --> 00:14:47.186
The new album 'Whitey
Ford's House of Pain'

00:14:47.186 --> 00:14:48.421
is it all new music?

00:14:48.421 --> 00:14:51.891
Yeah. It's my first studio album
in about eight years.

00:14:52.391 --> 00:14:54.761
Is it more singer/songwriter
this one?

00:14:54.761 --> 00:14:56.829
No, it's kind of like
everything in the toolbox.

00:14:56.829 --> 00:14:59.699
I brought back
some more hip hop

00:14:59.699 --> 00:15:01.701
and a couple hip hop producers,
friends of mine,

00:15:01.701 --> 00:15:03.936
I got Aloe Blacc singing on it,
I got my guy

00:15:03.936 --> 00:15:05.371
Slug from Atmosphere
doing a song.

00:15:05.371 --> 00:15:06.606
Slug's the shit.

00:15:06.606 --> 00:15:08.341
I know him, he's a great guy.

00:15:08.341 --> 00:15:10.510
That's awesome.
Is it to the point now

00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:12.512
where you're having fun
making the music?

00:15:12.512 --> 00:15:14.147
I've always had fun.

00:15:14.147 --> 00:15:16.783
Writing 'Jump Around'
and what it's like,

00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:19.485
and then put your lights on.

00:15:19.485 --> 00:15:21.320
I can do whatever
the fuck I want.

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:23.422
I don't have to-
I can make what I wanna make.

00:15:23.422 --> 00:15:25.124
It doesn't matter
if it wins or loses.

00:15:25.124 --> 00:15:26.826
That's great.

00:15:27.326 --> 00:15:30.897
Luckily I never lose too tough.
And I win pretty decent.

00:15:30.897 --> 00:15:32.298
Yeah.

00:15:32.298 --> 00:15:34.467
I own my own masters,
I own my own label.

00:15:34.467 --> 00:15:36.803
I do alright.

00:15:39.605 --> 00:15:42.275
I look at cats that are way
bigger and richer than me,

00:15:42.275 --> 00:15:43.943
and I know they're
slaves to the game.

00:15:43.943 --> 00:15:45.211
Yeah.

00:15:45.211 --> 00:15:46.712
And I don't envy them
in a lot of ways.

00:15:46.712 --> 00:15:48.347
I'd like the bank account,

00:15:48.347 --> 00:15:50.383
I'd love to have their bank
account, don't get me wrong,

00:15:50.383 --> 00:15:53.553
but not if it comes with-
one of the first times

00:15:53.553 --> 00:15:55.788
I was ever on Rogan,
I said something like,

00:15:55.788 --> 00:15:58.825
"I like going to Ralph's
and sitting at the olive bar

00:15:58.825 --> 00:16:01.527
and getting my own olives."
And like "Jump Around"

00:16:01.527 --> 00:16:03.362
is playing
and nobody knows

00:16:03.362 --> 00:16:05.164
I'm fucking there, dude,
I love that shit.

00:16:05.164 --> 00:16:06.566
I heard an interview-

00:16:06.566 --> 00:16:08.234
Then you walked in that deli
one night thinking,

00:16:08.234 --> 00:16:10.937
"I'm gonna get a sandwich
and keep it cool."

00:16:12.038 --> 00:16:13.272
Mr. Everlast?

00:16:13.272 --> 00:16:14.674
I like New York though,
New York's different,

00:16:14.674 --> 00:16:16.209
the city's different.

00:16:16.209 --> 00:16:18.377
I heard Dan Castellaneta
from the Simpsons

00:16:18.377 --> 00:16:21.047
say that about doing Homer,
he's like, "I have a life.

00:16:21.047 --> 00:16:24.317
I can just go have a life
and I'm one of the most iconic-"

00:16:24.317 --> 00:16:26.018
And he's fucking super rich.

00:16:27.253 --> 00:16:28.955
Super rich. It's funny
because you're saying-

00:16:28.955 --> 00:16:30.189
Doh.

00:16:30.189 --> 00:16:31.657
You're saying own
the master stuff,

00:16:31.657 --> 00:16:33.960
and I just know I'm dumb that
even if I got success

00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:35.561
there would be a thing
where they're like,

00:16:35.561 --> 00:16:37.363
"No you signed
that away early on."

00:16:37.363 --> 00:16:39.198
Fuck, I knew it.

00:16:39.198 --> 00:16:41.100
That's the money right there,
is owning your own shit.

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:42.768
Well I don't own the 'Jump
Around' masters.

00:16:42.768 --> 00:16:43.970
Okay.

00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:47.573
I own all the masters since I
left the major label system.

00:16:47.573 --> 00:16:50.176
You'd be jetpacking Homer.

00:16:52.478 --> 00:16:54.447
Do you get it back
at some point?

00:16:54.447 --> 00:16:55.781
No, but I mean I own
the publishing,

00:16:55.781 --> 00:16:57.950
I still own my publishing.

00:16:57.950 --> 00:16:59.518
It's just when
you did record deals,

00:16:59.518 --> 00:17:01.120
they own the masters,
that's the way it was back then.

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:02.321
Yeah.

00:17:02.321 --> 00:17:04.323
It's not a horrible thing,
I still get paid.

00:17:04.323 --> 00:17:05.992
Do you get excited
when you're in a bar-

00:17:05.992 --> 00:17:07.927
When you own the masters,
you get all the money.

00:17:07.927 --> 00:17:09.195
Which is nice.

00:17:09.195 --> 00:17:11.497
When you're at a bar
on St. Patty's Day

00:17:12.131 --> 00:17:13.733
and they play 'Jump
Around'-

00:17:13.733 --> 00:17:17.470
Okay, so we're talking '94'
the last time that happened.

00:17:18.137 --> 00:17:19.605
I don't go to bars
on St. Patty's Day.

00:17:19.605 --> 00:17:21.207
Next St. Patty's Day,
me and you.

00:17:21.207 --> 00:17:23.009
If you hear 'Jump
Around' at a bar-

00:17:23.009 --> 00:17:24.710
I don't need a house-
no actually that's not true,

00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:27.013
St. Patty's is a big payday
for me, I forget all the time.

00:17:27.013 --> 00:17:29.115
Fuck, that's why
I brought this up.

00:17:29.115 --> 00:17:31.617
If any of us hear 'Jump
Around', we lose our shit.

00:17:32.285 --> 00:17:35.121
It's inevitable that all of us
start just bopping.

00:17:35.121 --> 00:17:36.489
Oh shit.

00:17:36.489 --> 00:17:38.691
There's a funny thing,
usually around December

00:17:38.691 --> 00:17:39.959
I start getting competing.

00:17:39.959 --> 00:17:41.861
Who wants me on actually
St. Patty's.

00:17:41.861 --> 00:17:44.697
I usually do four things
around that weekend

00:17:44.697 --> 00:17:47.266
or whenever St. Patty's
Day falls,

00:17:48.067 --> 00:17:49.936
but there's always
a nice little fight

00:17:49.936 --> 00:17:51.938
between who gets him on
St. Patty's Day.

00:17:52.972 --> 00:17:54.173
You also wrote the anthem

00:17:54.173 --> 00:17:57.176
for the NBA's
first second of the game.

00:17:57.176 --> 00:17:59.178
I haven't been to a stadium
that doesn't start playing

00:17:59.178 --> 00:18:00.446
Jump before the jumps.

00:18:00.446 --> 00:18:02.515
I think it's most sporting
events, honestly.

00:18:02.515 --> 00:18:03.916
I don't think there's
any sporting event

00:18:03.916 --> 00:18:05.618
I haven't heard it at.

00:18:07.219 --> 00:18:09.655
I went to the world cup
of cricket and they played it.

00:18:09.655 --> 00:18:11.424
Really? Dude that's so funny.

00:18:11.424 --> 00:18:12.725
Yeah. It was a while ago,
but it was

00:18:12.725 --> 00:18:16.362
Pakistan vs Australia,
so I don't know how long

00:18:16.362 --> 00:18:19.398
That might be every one,
for all I know.

00:18:19.398 --> 00:18:21.100
You were falling pussy to that.

00:18:23.102 --> 00:18:25.771
My brother plays cricket,
would you like to come?

00:18:25.771 --> 00:18:27.039
Alright.

00:18:27.039 --> 00:18:29.842
I had the day off in London
and somebody had tickets

00:18:29.842 --> 00:18:32.144
to the world cup of cricket.
I was like fuck it.

00:18:32.144 --> 00:18:34.747
Yeah, dude. It's funny,
because you think in baseball,

00:18:34.747 --> 00:18:36.949
the MLB, they come up to songs
and in cricket they do-

00:18:36.949 --> 00:18:39.518
they're like,
"No butting for Pakistan.

00:18:39.518 --> 00:18:41.354
Weeeeeeeee!

00:18:41.354 --> 00:18:43.022
Let's just play 'Jump Around'
and you're like,

00:18:43.022 --> 00:18:44.724
"Oh fuck,
that's the song, cool."

00:18:45.558 --> 00:18:47.193
I would make
another cricket reference,

00:18:47.193 --> 00:18:48.561
but I know nothing else about-

00:18:48.561 --> 00:18:50.296
(imitating foreign language)

00:18:50.863 --> 00:18:54.166
Caw, or whatever their fucking
weird point scoring thing is.

00:18:54.166 --> 00:18:55.468
Is that weed or?

00:18:55.468 --> 00:18:57.570
Yeah, I don't smoke anything
that isn't weed.

00:18:57.570 --> 00:18:59.505
Oh, dude, you should try this
one. I got a dispensable one-

00:18:59.505 --> 00:19:01.374
I won't touch it if your lips
have touched it too.

00:19:01.374 --> 00:19:02.708
Cool, I get that too.

00:19:02.708 --> 00:19:08.247
Well, Jay welcome
to ...

00:19:08.247 --> 00:19:10.883
Real quick, one of the reasons
I say shit like that,

00:19:10.883 --> 00:19:12.818
I'm a germophobe because
my oldest daughter

00:19:12.818 --> 00:19:14.487
was born with cystic fibrosis.
Got it.

00:19:14.487 --> 00:19:15.688
For real?

00:19:15.688 --> 00:19:16.956
I don't know,
I always bring it up

00:19:16.956 --> 00:19:18.290
because we like
to raise awareness.

00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:19.925
Yeah.
So look it up.

00:19:19.925 --> 00:19:22.228
I'm a big ghoul, so when you say
that I'm like,

00:19:22.228 --> 00:19:23.429
"Alright, yeah,
I get it."

00:19:23.429 --> 00:19:25.698
I just won't-
it's one of the things.

00:19:26.298 --> 00:19:27.900
Walking up to me
and sticking your hand out

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:29.235
is gonna get
your feelings hurt.

00:19:29.235 --> 00:19:30.469
Yeah.

00:19:30.469 --> 00:19:31.871
Most times.

00:19:31.871 --> 00:19:33.939
Knuckle pound?
You do a knuckle pound?

00:19:33.939 --> 00:19:35.808
Yeah, that's the thing I'll do.

00:19:35.808 --> 00:19:37.243
Alright, I'll give you
one of these,

00:19:37.243 --> 00:19:39.011
and people get
that look sometimes.

00:19:39.812 --> 00:19:41.981
Alright Howie Mandell.

00:19:41.981 --> 00:19:44.016
Is it because you don't wanna
bring germs into your house.

00:19:44.016 --> 00:19:48.854
I don't wanna touch you.
But I try to show some love,

00:19:48.854 --> 00:19:53.025
but I don't wanna any-
this is wet, this is dry.

00:19:54.527 --> 00:19:57.096
It shouldn't be wet, mine isn't,
but most people shouldn't be,

00:19:57.096 --> 00:19:58.931
but sometimes
I just can't do that.

00:20:00.666 --> 00:20:04.170
I'm gonna use and entire fucking
pint of sanitizer afterwards.

00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:05.504
Do you always have it on you?

00:20:05.504 --> 00:20:07.239
Do you always got
the hand sanitizer on you?

00:20:07.239 --> 00:20:09.375
I just ran out today, but yes.

00:20:09.375 --> 00:20:11.210
I gotta get some more
before I get to the plane.

00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:13.179
How are you with doorknobs
and stuff like that?

00:20:13.179 --> 00:20:14.613
I have alcohol wipes.

00:20:14.613 --> 00:20:16.182
So you just constantly
do that all day?

00:20:16.182 --> 00:20:17.416
Yes.

00:20:17.416 --> 00:20:19.485
I just watched a couple get on
the subway on my way up here

00:20:19.485 --> 00:20:21.020
and they were
wiping down the bar,

00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:22.388
and I was sitting across,
I was kind of like,

00:20:22.388 --> 00:20:23.656
"Why am I offended by this?"

00:20:23.656 --> 00:20:25.324
You touch that dirty ass
thing every day?

00:20:25.324 --> 00:20:27.326
I'll lick it,
I don't give a shit.

00:20:27.326 --> 00:20:29.662
Bring it on, world.

00:20:30.196 --> 00:20:32.198
I'm stronger than anyone.

00:20:32.198 --> 00:20:33.766
Jacob's giving me the word
that you gotta go,

00:20:33.766 --> 00:20:35.067
you gotta catch a flight.

00:20:35.067 --> 00:20:36.735
Dude, yo, I'm gonna come back
though,

00:20:36.735 --> 00:20:37.937
for real,
this was fun man.

00:20:37.937 --> 00:20:39.238
Please do.

00:20:39.238 --> 00:20:41.173
I wish I had the time.

00:20:41.173 --> 00:20:42.675
Real quick, are you gonna
tour on the album?

00:20:42.675 --> 00:20:45.077
Yeah, I'm in Europe-
I believe today

00:20:45.077 --> 00:20:46.612
I go home for two days
with my kids,

00:20:46.612 --> 00:20:48.414
then I'm rushing to Europe
all September.

00:20:48.414 --> 00:20:49.682
Are you doing any-

00:20:49.682 --> 00:20:51.851
I'm coming back, I gotta-
we're doing a UFC

00:20:51.851 --> 00:20:54.186
pre-party thing,
I'm doing a show at the Brooklyn

00:20:54.186 --> 00:20:56.856
Bowl in Vegas the night
before Conor McGregor, Khabib.

00:20:57.890 --> 00:20:59.825
Shut the fuck up,
that's awesome.

00:20:59.825 --> 00:21:01.494
You should come.
You should come host it.

00:21:01.494 --> 00:21:02.695
I will.
Yeah? 100%

00:21:02.695 --> 00:21:05.364
I'll do it for free.
I'll do it for free.

00:21:06.932 --> 00:21:09.001
I wasn't gonna be there.

00:21:09.001 --> 00:21:10.703
I'll still do it for free.

00:21:11.403 --> 00:21:13.906
Everlast's new album
'Whitey Ford's House of

00:21:13.906 --> 00:21:15.407
Pain',
hopefully we'll see you

00:21:15.407 --> 00:21:16.709
when you come perform
in New York, man.

00:21:16.709 --> 00:21:17.977
Absolutely.

00:21:17.977 --> 00:21:19.445
Or in a deli
where I can find you.

00:21:19.445 --> 00:21:20.679
It was fun, man.

00:21:20.679 --> 00:21:22.314
Don't turn off your GPS.

00:21:22.314 --> 00:21:24.416
I'll be on the top row,
singing every song.

00:21:24.416 --> 00:21:26.051
Everlast.
Alright we'll be right back.

00:21:26.051 --> 00:21:27.753
It is 'The Bonfire.'

00:21:28.921 --> 00:21:30.956
I'm fucking hammered
by the way.

00:21:30.956 --> 00:21:33.325
Yeah.

00:21:33.325 --> 00:21:35.294
Your eyes are closing-
cause your eyes are closing.

00:21:35.294 --> 00:21:36.962
Dude I'm fucking.

00:21:36.962 --> 00:21:38.464
I need more ice the catch up.

00:21:38.464 --> 00:21:40.266
Dude, you got hammered
with Everlast.

00:21:40.266 --> 00:21:42.368
I tried to get high with him
and he shot that down.

00:21:42.368 --> 00:21:45.504
My only regret was me going,
"We're famous."

00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:50.276
My regret was basically me
asking

00:21:50.276 --> 00:21:51.810
Everlast if he wanted
to have a catch.

00:21:51.810 --> 00:21:53.045
You guys, by the way, you guys-

00:21:53.045 --> 00:21:54.446
You wanna smoke weed?
He goes, "No."

00:21:54.446 --> 00:21:55.915
You guys made my
deli interaction

00:21:55.915 --> 00:21:57.183
seem downright awesome.

00:21:57.183 --> 00:22:01.387
Oh, nice shit. But we're legit
famous comedians.

00:22:01.387 --> 00:22:03.122
He goes, "I swear to god
if you sing a song,

00:22:03.122 --> 00:22:04.723
I'll get butt fucking
naked right now."

00:22:04.723 --> 00:22:10.563
(mumbling)

00:22:10.563 --> 00:22:12.064
How bad do you think
that would've been?

00:22:12.064 --> 00:22:14.300
It would've been great.
Bert's getting naked,

00:22:14.934 --> 00:22:16.569
Dan's licking things
in off room two

00:22:16.569 --> 00:22:20.005
and I'm just going,
(mumbling)

00:22:20.005 --> 00:22:21.473
We should've just
fucking bombarded him

00:22:21.473 --> 00:22:22.775
and just had him
leave right away.

00:22:22.775 --> 00:22:25.311
Mike's heavy nose
breathing staring at him.

00:22:25.311 --> 00:22:27.379
You think you can take me
motherfucker?

00:22:27.379 --> 00:22:28.747
I'm bear crawling
around the room.

00:22:28.747 --> 00:22:31.050
Do you know what
my core strength is?

00:22:31.050 --> 00:22:32.785
Do you even know
what my core strength is?

00:22:32.785 --> 00:22:34.286
You get me in a fucking
small two bedroom

00:22:34.286 --> 00:22:35.654
I will fucking light you up.

00:22:35.654 --> 00:22:37.523
Jay's just going, "Hey, hey,"
and then it goes like this,

00:22:37.523 --> 00:22:38.824
just touching
his shoulder going,

00:22:38.824 --> 00:22:45.097
(mumbling)
I'm going like this,

00:22:47.299 --> 00:22:48.767
Do you want some?

00:22:48.767 --> 00:22:50.469
This is weed.
646
00:22:51,937 --&gt; 00:00:00,000
You want some of this pizza?
