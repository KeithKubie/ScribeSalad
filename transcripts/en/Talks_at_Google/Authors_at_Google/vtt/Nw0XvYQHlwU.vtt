THOMAS PAGE MCBEE: Thanks guys.

00:00:01.761 --> 00:00:04.095
I'm really excited to be here.

00:00:04.095 --> 00:00:06.220
So I'm just going to do a
little--I'm going to talk

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:10.150
a little bit about
one title I have,

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:12.620
which was bestowed
on me by Vice,

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:14.342
which is a masculinity expert.

00:00:14.342 --> 00:00:15.800
It's kind of
tongue-in-cheek, but I

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.840
think it's a great way to
start a larger conversation

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.520
about gender that I'm
really interesting in having

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:22.810
all the time.

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.550
So, in 2013, I began
writing a column for Vice.

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.705
And it was funny, that
they were calling me

00:00:27.705 --> 00:00:29.330
a masculinity expert,
because I've only

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.470
been a man in the
literal sense of being

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.615
on testosterone for
about three years.

00:00:33.615 --> 00:00:35.890
And now I give talks
about masculinity all

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:37.360
over the country.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.320
And I'm writing a new
book based on a column

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.290
I'm writing for the
"Pacific Standard."

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:42.590
And I don't know what
the book will be called,

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.650
but the column's called
"The American Man."

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.440
So I guess the first question
is, how did this happen?

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.110
How did I become a masculinity
expert in four years or less?

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.950
So to me, in many
ways, the story

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.390
starts with the book,
"Man Alive," which

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.110
I began writing in 2010,
but sort of the narrative

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:02.940
started way before that.

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.170
And how I became a man and a
masculinity expert in general,

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.110
is really the story of
how I became myself.

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:09.644
So that's where
I'd like to start.

00:01:09.644 --> 00:01:12.060
So, I'm going to read you guys
a little bit from the book.

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.820
And I'll read a little
bit more in a few minutes.

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.277
And then we'll take
questions in a little bit

00:01:15.277 --> 00:01:16.400
because I think questions
are much more fun.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.010
And I want to know
who you all are

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:19.980
and why you're here,
which is the most

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.160
interesting thing to me.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.760
So this is the
prologue of book, which

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.850
I think sets us
up pretty nicely.

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:25.900
"South Carolina.

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.205
August 2010.

00:01:27.205 --> 00:01:28.630
29 years old.

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.030
What makes a man?

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.940
It's not that I haven't studied
them, their sinew, their slang,

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:33.940
their beautiful bristle.

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.200
But before I was held at
gunpoint on a cold April day,

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.950
I couldn't have told you.

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.100
A real man, a family man,
the Marlboro man, man up,

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.850
the man in the mirror.

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.130
I loved that Michael
Jackson song growing up,

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.760
used to forget my girl hips.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.060
Used to sing it to my best
imagination of myself.

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.450
What makes a man?

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.560
The need to know led me
to my father's hometown

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.340
in hot, damp South Carolina.

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:58.900
The story starts
there because that's

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.650
where I went when I
could no longer afford

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.080
to leave the question alone.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.570
To let it rear up
every few years

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.486
when I'd had too much
to drink and it was just

00:02:05.486 --> 00:02:08.465
me and my reflection
and my hungry ghosts.

00:02:08.465 --> 00:02:10.340
And so I steered my
rental through the swampy

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.220
south with my cap pulled low.

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.710
I had that teen
boy swagger, scars

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:17.030
like smiles across
my chest, and a body

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.752
I was just beginning to love.

00:02:18.752 --> 00:02:20.210
But the story also
begins the night

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:24.210
I almost died, back in
April of 2010, and in 1985,

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.170
when my father became a
monster, and in 1990 when

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.480
my mom found out he was one.

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.260
Men, she'd said then.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.482
And I learned to say it the
same way, a lemon in my mouth.

00:02:35.482 --> 00:02:36.940
In South Carolina,
I could smell it

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.190
through my open window,
alligators and secrets,

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.870
the embers of Sherman's
March, the Ku Klux Klan,

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.960
my father's farm burning.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.700
It smelled like my animal
fear and the spicy deodorant

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.490
I used to cover it.

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:51.700
Men, I thought with
that old bitterness.

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.030
But I already knew
my body was shifting.

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.790
In fact, that's why I was there.

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.130
A good man is hard to find.

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.660
The windshield blurred, the road
was inky, the rain, biblical.

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.710
The cheap motel off the highway
seemed like not such a hot idea

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:07.260
after I passed my fifth
gun racked pickup.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.400
But there wasn't
any turning back.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.010
Once a body's in motion,
it stays in motion.

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.270
My mom's a physicist.

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:14.870
She told me that.

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.380
The truth is, this
is a ghost story.

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.680
No, this is an adventure story.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.980
This is an adventure story
about how I quit being a ghost."

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.370
So that's where it starts, 2010.

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.870
A little background.

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.750
This was before my transition.

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.260
I looked very masculine.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.800
And in April of that year.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.780
I was mugged from behind
and held execution-style

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.500
at gunpoint, by this man,
George Huggins, who went on

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:47.180
to actually shoot two other men
and kill one in the process.

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.360
So what was really
interesting about this for me,

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.390
was that I was released when I
spoke, when my voice came out

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:55.994
of my mouth.

00:03:55.994 --> 00:03:57.410
Up until that
point, I don't think

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:01.450
that George Huggins
realized that I wasn't male.

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.090
And what was really
amazing to me,

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.620
was that that actually set
me on this whole story,

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.630
that it turned around my ideas
of what gender sort of meant

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:12.130
and it set me free
in a lot of ways.

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:13.630
And I was really
interested in that,

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:15.270
which is where the
book came from.

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:16.550
Because I got to run away.

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:18.174
And it gave me not
just a new angle on,

00:04:18.174 --> 00:04:22.060
not just my body, but
also my story in general.

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.530
And obviously there's a
Google connection here.

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:29.807
So 2011, I guess at this
point I was asking myself

00:04:29.807 --> 00:04:31.390
a lot of questions
about like, if it's

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:34.170
possible to be a good man.

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:37.179
I was revisiting, by doing that,
my examples of like, the worst

00:04:37.179 --> 00:04:38.720
examples of masculinity,
because that

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.549
was sort of what was
holding me up in general.

00:04:41.549 --> 00:04:43.590
And I meant, in a lot of
ways, the worst examples

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.380
were my father, which
I know a lot of men

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:49.980
can relate to that, and also of
course, Mr. Huggins, himself.

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:52.080
And what I was really
interested in too,

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.210
was just exploring the
universals of masculinity.

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.737
I didn't ever think of
myself as just a trans man,

00:04:57.737 --> 00:04:59.570
having to figure out
what it is to be trans.

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:01.350
I thought of myself
as a man, figuring out

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.433
what it is to be a man,
which I think a lot of men

00:05:03.433 --> 00:05:05.359
really struggle with
what that really means.

00:05:05.359 --> 00:05:07.400
So I'll read you a little
bit more from the book,

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.090
just to give you a little
more context of what

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:11.830
that looked like.

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:13.840
You know, I'm an
artist, so I don't never

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.630
pretend to speak on
anybody else's behalf.

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:18.081
I'm not speaking on behalf
of the trans community

00:05:18.081 --> 00:05:18.580
or anything.

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.230
But I think when we can
listen to one person story,

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:25.290
we learn a lot about
all of our stories.

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:27.880
"I could tell that
Dad charmed people.

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.030
Everyone gravitated to his
lilting southern accent,

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:32.840
his aw shucks smile,
and his good manners.

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:34.860
He seemed useful,
refined, and so

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:36.640
it was easy to overlook
his silver halo,

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.650
forget he was in his
'50s, way older than Mom.

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:42.720
But people can hold their true
selves at bay for only so long.

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.730
I knew that from Batman.

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:46.760
Today, he looked
worn out, exposed,

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.240
waiting for us in
a leather chair,

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.477
his remaining hair unkempt,
gray stubble crowding his face.

00:05:51.477 --> 00:05:53.810
His knuckles were thick,
swollen as an old man's, and he

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:57.667
wore his exercise clothes, a
gray tracksuit, coffee-stained.

00:05:57.667 --> 00:05:59.250
He looked like the
raggedy dog he once

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:01.580
shot in the butt with
a BB gun for crossing

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:04.342
onto our property
one too many times.

00:06:04.342 --> 00:06:06.550
"What are you doing," Mom
had said on the sunny porch

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:08.230
that afternoon a
few years before,

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:10.200
her voice laced with alarm.

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:11.960
Maybe she'd never
seen that side of him.

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.730
But I knew it
intimately and how he'd

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:15.490
look when he turned
around, smiling

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:17.850
that dumb, menacing smile.

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:20.000
Of course, one man
can become another.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.780
Where two sides meet, comes
the potential for ghosts.

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:25.800
Dissonance smears,
rips in the story.

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.870
It was only his ass, he'd
said, in that gentle accent,

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:31.270
unloading the BBs
carefully into his palm.

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:33.150
Just teaching him a lesson.

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:36.350
The dog never did come back.

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:39.190
Where I grew up in
Western Pennsylvania,

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:41.620
deer were hunted to keep
the population down.

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:45.190
still we put out salt
licks and watched

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:46.259
whole families wander by.

00:06:46.259 --> 00:06:48.300
I thought I could open
the door and approach them

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:50.230
as long as I moved
slowly enough.

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:53.150
They'd lock eyes with me, ears
pricked, stuck, as if stopped

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:54.260
by time.

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:58.290
I'd get closer and closer,
five yards, four, three.

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:00.820
I'd reach a hand out greedily,
and like magic, their eyes

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:04.300
would pop open a little, the
body hunching into themselves.

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:07.440
Then, always, they'd spring
awake and bound away, big

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:10.020
and graceful, alive.

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:12.880
There was an invisible
line, a wire I'd trip,

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:16.630
and it was different each
time, four yards two.

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:18.420
Every body has a
different threshold,

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:20.250
but we all know how
to run eventually.

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:21.980
Most people don't realize that.

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:27.117
We never forget how to escape."

00:07:27.117 --> 00:07:28.950
So once I was convinced
that there was a way

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:33.310
to meet a good man, that's when
I began my transition in 2011.

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:36.600
So I was 30 years
old at the time.

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.942
And because I'm a writer
and I work in media,

00:07:38.942 --> 00:07:40.900
one thing that I was
really interested in was I

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:42.980
didn't see my story anywhere.

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:46.120
Not just my story of like, what
is to be a trans man, but again

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:47.660
the kind of man I wanted to be.

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:50.220
I never felt very
connected to the idea being

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:52.260
born in the wrong
body, which was

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:53.770
the narrative that
was out there.

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:55.420
It's hard to imagine this
was just a few years ago.

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:57.746
But really, if you saw any
stories about a trans person

00:07:57.746 --> 00:07:59.120
in media, you were
seeing a story

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:01.100
about someone being
murdered, or you

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:07.206
were seeing these sort of like
soft, heart-wrenching stories

00:08:07.206 --> 00:08:09.080
about how people were
trapped in their bodies

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:10.882
and they just
needed to transition

00:08:10.882 --> 00:08:12.340
and make their
lives better so they

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:14.470
could be in a different
body and then everything

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:15.440
was perfect after that.

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:19.500
I just didn't really relate
to either of those narratives.

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:21.916
So what I thought a lot about
was, like I was becoming

00:08:21.916 --> 00:08:23.290
a man, what I was
really becoming

00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:24.862
was an intentional human being.

00:08:24.862 --> 00:08:26.570
And since I didn't
see my story anywhere,

00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:27.750
I just started writing it.

00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:30.740
So I wrote stories for "Salon"
and "The Atlantic" and "Vice"

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:32.490
and the "New York Times."

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:34.970
I just wanted to write
myself into existence.

00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:37.250
I really believe that
the most violent thing

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:41.270
we can do each other is make
each other, other, pretend

00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:43.409
that an experience that's
human that any one of us

00:08:43.409 --> 00:08:45.930
is experiencing is
somehow really radically

00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:48.750
different than an experience
another of us could have.

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:53.420
And I found that very, very
violent and very upsetting.

00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:57.150
So my goal from the very
beginning has been to say,

00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:59.680
this is my particular story,
but it's a story any of us

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:00.760
could have.

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:02.550
I'm a universalist
and I really think

00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:05.625
in a lot of ways my transition
wasn't about female to male,

00:09:05.625 --> 00:09:06.500
that's really simple.

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:08.620
I think it was about
young adult to adult,

00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:10.300
which I think most
people can relate to.

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:12.800
And I'm the kind of person who
sees similarities everywhere.

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.440
I mean, when I
was transitioning,

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:17.702
I related most to
pregnant women.

00:09:17.702 --> 00:09:18.660
I lived in New England.

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:19.660
I didn't have a trans community.

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:21.120
So I spent a lot
of time with women

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:22.900
who were having a lot
of hormonal changes

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:25.370
and who were wondering who they
were going to be once they had

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:27.619
their baby and what this
identity would mean for them.

00:09:27.619 --> 00:09:30.050
And those were the people
I was connecting to most.

00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:33.190
So my work has always
been about that.

00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:36.140
So that's what I
was doing in 2012.

00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:39.460
Also, I was writing this column
called "The Self-Made Man,"

00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:43.210
which I started when I was a
few months on testosterone,

00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:44.710
because I didn't
have the community,

00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:45.900
and I didn't see
myself anywhere.

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:48.600
And I've been lucky enough to
write it for the last two years

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:49.460
now.

00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:51.100
And I think in a
lot of ways, this

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:53.580
was capturing the big
questions in my book

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:55.600
and just my life in general.

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.629
It opens, this is
the very first one,

00:09:57.629 --> 00:09:58.920
"What does it mean to be a man?

00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:00.810
To me it means a lot
and nothing at all.

00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:02.690
It means I'm 30 years
old and I love my body.

00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:05.680
It means that men look at me
and see an ally or a threat.

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:07.340
It means nothing
is what it seems,

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:09.798
that none of us can look at
another and know what's in this

00:10:09.798 --> 00:10:12.190
pants or his heart, and
that surprise is inevitable,

00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:16.020
but how you react to
it is who you are. "

00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:18.280
And that's a lot of like,
the question I was asking

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:22.420
and really, I guess I
knew the answer all along.

00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:25.940
So by last year, 2013, I
was asking and answering

00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:28.160
this question all over
the place and it's sort of

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:29.535
moved on to a
different question.

00:10:29.535 --> 00:10:30.960
Instead of what
makes a man, I was

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:33.410
asking, how do we become
more than what's sold to us.

00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:35.170
Meaning, we have
an understanding

00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:36.940
what masculinity
means, but where

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:38.460
do we get that understanding?

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:42.140
I think, my experience is
that gender is kind of innate.

00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:44.810
I think that we, in a
lot of ways, are born,

00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:46.600
at least having
some understanding

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:48.910
of who we are in the world.

00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:52.020
But the way that we
embody that gender,

00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:54.579
is something that we have
a lot of choice around.

00:10:54.579 --> 00:10:56.370
So I wasn't ever
interested in specifically

00:10:56.370 --> 00:10:58.100
writing about the
trans experience.

00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:00.475
But I was interested in writing
about the male experience

00:11:00.475 --> 00:11:01.610
and the human experience.

00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:04.290
And I think gender's just
one very powerful dimension

00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:09.710
of identity, and just a way for
me personally to examine that.

00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:12.810
So I think in the end, when I
was asking the question of what

00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:15.870
makes a man, what I really meant
was, what makes a good man.

00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:18.660
And I spent a lot of time
talking to men about gender,

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:20.415
because I think a
lot of men don't even

00:11:20.415 --> 00:11:22.390
realize they have one,
which is basically

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:25.140
the definition of privilege, is
to move in the world thinking

00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:28.390
that something is invisible,
when really it's not at all.

00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:30.480
So being able to make it
visible is a really cool,

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:34.860
important thing that, hopefully,
I get to do for people.

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:37.869
And I also think with privilege
comes a lot of responsibility.

00:11:37.869 --> 00:11:39.660
And that's where being
a good man comes in.

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:42.292
There's a lot of toxic
ideas about masculinity

00:11:42.292 --> 00:11:43.250
out there in the world.

00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:45.624
And there's a way to be very
healthy in your masculinity.

00:11:45.624 --> 00:11:47.830
And that's something
that I think a lot about.

00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:49.246
And I think the
first step is just

00:11:49.246 --> 00:11:53.430
understanding that if you can
see it, you can change it.

00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:55.880
For one thing, I know I'm
treated very differently.

00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:58.710
I do a lot of talks to
people about workspace stuff,

00:11:58.710 --> 00:12:01.100
about sexism at work
because I'm treated

00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:05.090
very differently in a male body
that in my previous body, which

00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:06.580
wasn't female actually.

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:09.090
I would say it was
more a queer body.

00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:12.210
So the way people reacted
to me, was very different

00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:13.980
than the way people
react to me now.

00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:16.280
I'm given a lot more room
and a lot more respect.

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:18.460
People listen to me more.

00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:19.890
And I spend a lot
of time thinking

00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:23.360
about how different bodies
are treated in space

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:25.980
and how, as a person in a
leadership role in media,

00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:28.760
I can make sure that
people who are male,

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:31.600
in the sort of passing male way
that I am, especially straight

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:34.360
white men, we make
more room for people

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:37.510
who are not those bodies.

00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:38.010
And again.

00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:39.926
I think a lot it's just
having some intention,

00:12:39.926 --> 00:12:41.770
just having some
awareness about,

00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:44.960
if you're lucky enough to be
in a body that has privilege

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:47.360
in this world, how do
you operate in such a way

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:50.590
to make room for everyone else.

00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:53.960
So, now today, 2014,
I write this column,

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:57.980
like I said, "The American
Man" for "Pacific Standard,"

00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:00.840
and basically, it's a broad
survey of masculinity, really

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:02.990
white American masculinity.

00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:05.730
And I go to a bunch of places,
like I went to a boxing gym.

00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:06.820
I've been to a bath house.

00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:08.480
I'm going to frats.

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:11.560
And basically just
reporting back gonzo style.

00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:14.550
So this is a little
excerpt from one

00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:17.310
about going to a boxing gym.

00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:19.020
But I think that
the main point is

00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:22.360
that, when I think about being
a man today, what I'm thinking

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:25.680
about being, is being so much
more than just a man moving

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:28.536
in space, but being an
intentional human being.

00:13:28.536 --> 00:13:30.035
And again, just
making that visible.

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:37.070
So, finally, I think now
where I'm at in 2014,

00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:39.680
thinking about what being
an expert about being a man

00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:43.210
is, what I think we, all
people who are men are,

00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:46.660
it just is sort of,
there's a koan in Zen,

00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:48.726
"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind."

00:13:48.726 --> 00:13:50.350
Basically, I don't
know if anybody here

00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:52.840
is familiar with this koan,
but I find it very useful.

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:55.370
Which is basically,
that to be an expert

00:13:55.370 --> 00:13:56.850
is to have a very
closed mind when

00:13:56.850 --> 00:13:58.100
you think you know everything.

00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:00.010
But to be a beginner,
that's where

00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:02.420
real creativity and
expertise comes from.

00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:05.730
So I think, in a lot of ways,
my journey into masculinity

00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:07.780
was one of a beginner's mind.

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:09.640
And what I've come
up with is my answer.

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:11.110
What makes a man
is, like I said,

00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:14.060
I think gender in a
lot of ways is innate.

00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:15.720
I think, especially
in queer circles,

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:17.511
there's an idea that
gender is performance.

00:14:17.511 --> 00:14:19.880
And maybe so, but I
think that doesn't quite

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:21.030
explain my experience.

00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:23.630
Like, I knew I was a
guy, what does that mean?

00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:25.454
At the other end
of it, the paradox

00:14:25.454 --> 00:14:27.370
is that I also think
it's really constructive.

00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:30.700
I think we have a lot of
choice about what kind of men

00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:33.890
and women and everything else
we want to be in the world.

00:14:33.890 --> 00:14:36.740
So I think a man, and a good man
specifically, is intentional.

00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:39.110
And I think a good
man makes himself.

00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:41.230
And so that's what I
found in my journey.

00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:44.050
I'm happy to take questions.

00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:47.410
I guess my only caveat that
I tend to give about this is

00:14:47.410 --> 00:14:49.500
just, I love Q&amp;As.

00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:52.150
I really would love to
answer any questions.

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:53.650
Any question you
ask me is one you'd

00:14:53.650 --> 00:14:57.220
have to be willing
to answer yourself.

00:14:57.220 --> 00:15:00.600
I've only had to use
that a couple of times.

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:02.870
So does anybody have
anything they want to ask me?

00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:08.090
Or any statements
about, I don't know

00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:12.600
masculinity or
maleness or queerness.

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:13.697
Yes.

00:15:13.697 --> 00:15:15.072
AUDIENCE: You
talked a little bit

00:15:15.072 --> 00:15:17.092
about how you were
treated very differently

00:15:17.092 --> 00:15:18.050
before your transition.

00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:21.300
Could you talk a little bit
more about what happened?

00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:22.300
THOMAS PAGE MCBEE: Yeah.

00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:25.290
So I think I didn't know
I was treated differently.

00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:27.960
Because I didn't
have a really typical

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:29.210
feminine, female presentation.

00:15:29.210 --> 00:15:32.696
I think a lot of women who are
in the world in a feminine way,

00:15:32.696 --> 00:15:34.070
are very aware of
that difference

00:15:34.070 --> 00:15:35.361
because we talk about it a lot.

00:15:35.361 --> 00:15:36.860
But I was very
queer and masculine,

00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:39.540
which is a different thing.

00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:41.070
But still, at the
end of the day,

00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:43.810
I think I didn't read
as male in that way.

00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:46.892
So again, I don't think
there is one way that I

00:15:46.892 --> 00:15:48.970
was being treated
that I could pinpoint.

00:15:48.970 --> 00:15:51.940
But I do know that
suddenly, when

00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:53.360
I'm in spaces like
work meetings,

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:55.710
people pay more attention
to what I have to say.

00:15:55.710 --> 00:15:58.560
I have a lower voice
and I talk lower.

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:01.650
I'm actually harder to
hear, but people are quiet

00:16:01.650 --> 00:16:04.320
and they lean in
and they listen.

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:07.320
And generally, I
think that women

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:11.309
are socialized in a lot of ways
to sort of hang back or be very

00:16:11.309 --> 00:16:13.600
conscientious about what
everyone else is saying around

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:14.410
them.

00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:15.480
and men really aren't.

00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:17.940
And so I really
was aware of that

00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:20.890
very quickly, that
me being male,

00:16:20.890 --> 00:16:23.840
with a male voice in a
male space, if I spoke,

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:25.980
everyone would turn to
me and I was much more

00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:27.460
aggressive about communicating.

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:29.570
Whereas women in the
same spaces or people

00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:32.160
who were gender nonconforming
in the same spaces

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:34.280
might not be as
aggressive or emboldened.

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:36.380
And I was noticing that a lot.

00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:39.609
I was working at this place
called PolicyMic, now Mic,

00:16:39.609 --> 00:16:41.150
where we had a very
young staff and I

00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:42.440
was managing editor there.

00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:44.510
So I worked really
hard when I was there

00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:47.294
to try to make a lot of room
for women in the space to speak.

00:16:47.294 --> 00:16:48.960
Because again, I don't
think any of this

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:50.180
is an intentional sexism.

00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:53.070
I think it's actually just
socialized differences and then

00:16:53.070 --> 00:16:53.900
lack of awareness.

00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:55.524
And the more we make
something visible,

00:16:55.524 --> 00:16:59.460
the more it becomes a thing that
people are conscientious about.

00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:00.010
Yeah.

00:17:00.010 --> 00:17:01.742
AUDIENCE: So when
you go and talk

00:17:01.742 --> 00:17:05.455
to men about being [INAUDIBLE]
especially when they may not

00:17:05.455 --> 00:17:07.930
see their privlege, et cetera,
what are the kinds of road

00:17:07.930 --> 00:17:10.900
blocks that you find that
when you come to somebody,

00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:13.190
what's the first thing where
they sort of push back?

00:17:13.190 --> 00:17:14.450
THOMAS PAGE MCBEE: Yeah.

00:17:14.450 --> 00:17:16.741
I've actually found that it's
a lot more helpful to ask

00:17:16.741 --> 00:17:18.940
questions than it is, I
think-- I've actually talked

00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:21.530
to a lot of women who say,
I'm very frustrated because I

00:17:21.530 --> 00:17:24.200
try to explain to my boyfriend
what privilege means,

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:25.420
and he doesn't get it.

00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:29.000
Because he's saying, well,
I've had a hard life,

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.825
or this is my particular
life circumstance

00:17:30.825 --> 00:17:32.546
and you're not really
making room for it.

00:17:32.546 --> 00:17:34.170
That makes a lot of
sense because we're

00:17:34.170 --> 00:17:35.540
interpersonal creatures.

00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:37.970
But we also live in an
institutionalized world.

00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:41.260
So being able to hold both at
once, and I think a lot of men

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:42.120
get very defensive.

00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:44.740
Because they think, I'm
trying to be a good guy here.

00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:46.330
Why are you attacking
me or why am I

00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:49.480
having to hold the weight of
every male who ever has existed

00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:50.182
or whatever.

00:17:50.182 --> 00:17:52.640
But of course, that is part of
the privilege of being male,

00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:54.598
is you have to hold the
weight of every man who

00:17:54.598 --> 00:17:56.390
has ever existed before you.

00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:59.449
On the other hand, I
think a lot of times,

00:17:59.449 --> 00:18:01.240
men want to engage this
with this question,

00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:01.948
in my experience.

00:18:01.948 --> 00:18:03.850
They actually
really want to live

00:18:03.850 --> 00:18:06.120
in a world that's not
as constraining to them.

00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:07.700
Sexism hurts men too.

00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:11.190
So a way around,
sort of just being

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:14.460
in a weird kind of
defensive space with people,

00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:17.960
is to say, well,
what is masculinity?

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:20.870
What do you mean when you say
that you feel like you can only

00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:23.760
act this way or when you say
this thing about women, what

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:25.710
are you actually
saying right now?

00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:28.490
Like, just sort of opening
up to have a conversation

00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:30.620
has been a really
easy way to dig

00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:32.710
into what's really
troubling for everybody.

00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:35.950
Which is that we're in
these very rigid spaces

00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:38.080
culturally, that are
hurting all of us.

00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:41.770
So my biggest roadblock is
that men, in my experience,

00:18:41.770 --> 00:18:45.070
when they feel on the defensive,
because they feel like they're

00:18:45.070 --> 00:18:47.670
having to be responsive in a way
that is was like, whoa, whoa,

00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:47.860
whoa.

00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:49.240
I'm not doing anything wrong.

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:51.850
That is the same way as
like open communication

00:18:51.850 --> 00:18:53.500
with a couple where
it's like, I'm

00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:56.080
feeling this way when you do x.

00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:57.746
It so much easier to
sort of come at it

00:18:57.746 --> 00:19:04.560
from a more assuming
the best kind of place.

00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:08.700
And again, most men I talk to
are actually very responsive.

00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:09.441
Yeah.

00:19:09.441 --> 00:19:13.369
AUDIENCE: We live in a
world where being male

00:19:13.369 --> 00:19:15.333
is, in some ways, the default.

00:19:15.333 --> 00:19:17.297
Like, what you were
alluding to, right?

00:19:17.297 --> 00:19:22.698
And we have the privilege of
not thinking about gender.

00:19:22.698 --> 00:19:27.752
So having sort of seen things
from both outside and within,

00:19:27.752 --> 00:19:32.060
do you, like, have a-- you
tend to perceive that more

00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:39.459
and see, oh, I'm being
privileged in this situation I

00:19:39.459 --> 00:19:41.292
know you mentioned that
people pay attention

00:19:41.292 --> 00:19:44.870
to you at meetings and
stuff, but even if it's not

00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:46.810
interpersonal
interactions, do you see it

00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:49.041
in things like media?

00:19:49.041 --> 00:19:50.040
THOMAS PAGE MCBEE: Yeah.

00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:50.580
I think so.

00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:54.489
I mean, I think the great
advantage of having not lived

00:19:54.489 --> 00:19:56.280
in a male body until
this point, and in one

00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:58.500
that I would very easily
be able to sort of just

00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:02.120
fade into the woodwork
and like, relax about,

00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:04.160
is that suddenly
I am the default.

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:06.060
And I think, just
like white people

00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:08.710
have the need to work on
being aware that being white

00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:11.466
is the default, I think men
need to be aware that being male

00:20:11.466 --> 00:20:12.090
is the default.

00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:13.640
And absolutely, I notice it.

00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:15.800
I mean, it's pretty
jarring, actually,

00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:18.300
to go from especially
having a queer body,

00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:20.790
where I really didn't
fit into any gender box,

00:20:20.790 --> 00:20:24.950
to being in a situation
where, when I leave my house

00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:27.660
and walk down the street, a
million things are happening

00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:33.100
because I'm a white male who
is straight in the world.

00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:34.400
And I never forget that.

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:36.420
Because to me, that
dissonance is really

00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:38.280
interesting and
important and says a lot

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:40.660
about what is to be just
a person in the world.

00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:42.800
But also because I think
if I forgot that, then I

00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:45.250
would be the kind of
person, the kind of man,

00:20:45.250 --> 00:20:47.339
I didn't want to be
in the first place.

00:20:51.514 --> 00:20:52.180
Other questions?

00:20:55.508 --> 00:21:00.488
AUDIENCE: Thomas, this
year and last year,

00:21:00.488 --> 00:21:02.978
there just seems a
trans understanding

00:21:02.978 --> 00:21:09.452
[INAUDIBLE] already complicated,
but just understanding

00:21:09.452 --> 00:21:18.451
and awareness, I
guess. [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:18.451 --> 00:21:21.860
but so much has happened in
a year, in a year and a half,

00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:26.243
I've seen a reflection in
your writing of just looking

00:21:26.243 --> 00:21:29.014
to the next year or
the next five years,

00:21:29.014 --> 00:21:30.139
what are you excited about?

00:21:30.139 --> 00:21:32.769
I just see it really changing
and I'm just curious kind of,

00:21:32.769 --> 00:21:34.060
what you're looking forward to.

00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:35.060
THOMAS PAGE MCBEE: Yeah.

00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:38.390
I really bet, I really
bet hard on a few things

00:21:38.390 --> 00:21:39.410
for my own work.

00:21:39.410 --> 00:21:41.410
We talked a little at the
beginning about about,

00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:43.330
like in, 2010, when
I was first writing,

00:21:43.330 --> 00:21:47.090
of 2011 really, about
being trans and being male.

00:21:47.090 --> 00:21:49.800
There weren't any stories,
that were in mainstream media

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:52.820
anyway about this stuff,
except for kind of sad stories

00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:55.380
or again, very like,
kind of essentialist,

00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:57.860
very reductive stories,
that really, in my mind,

00:21:57.860 --> 00:22:01.770
assumed the worst of
the non trans audience.

00:22:01.770 --> 00:22:03.470
Like, the sort
of, oh, man, we've

00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:05.770
really got to work hard to
help people understand this.

00:22:05.770 --> 00:22:08.000
So trans people are
born in the wrong body.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:08.580
OK.

00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:09.360
Does that make sense?

00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:10.776
And then we just
made this change.

00:22:10.776 --> 00:22:12.210
And then, OK, now
we're like you.

00:22:12.210 --> 00:22:13.100
So, whew.

00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:14.820
Like, you know.

00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:18.170
And I think a lot of that comes
from the gate-keeping medical

00:22:18.170 --> 00:22:18.800
narrative too.

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:20.050
Like, where it's
like, to get hormones,

00:22:20.050 --> 00:22:22.260
trans people throughout time--
and a lot of trans people

00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:23.430
relate to that narrative,
so that's fine.

00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:25.160
But trans people
throughout time,

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:27.380
have had, since hormones
have been available,

00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:29.296
have had to basically
go into doctor's offices

00:22:29.296 --> 00:22:31.630
and say, you know, I feel
trapped in the wrong body.

00:22:31.630 --> 00:22:34.260
I'm going to kill myself if
I don't make this change.

00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:37.160
And then, therefore, that's
how you get your hormones.

00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:39.680
So I think in the
last few years,

00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:43.600
what's really changed is social
media and new media providing

00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:46.120
these platforms for those
of us who are like, no,

00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:47.110
that's not quite right.

00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:48.026
It's more complicated.

00:22:48.026 --> 00:22:49.750
It's nuanced.

00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:52.910
To write those stories, but also
provided like room for people

00:22:52.910 --> 00:22:54.177
to meet us there.

00:22:54.177 --> 00:22:55.760
I think social media
really encourages

00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:58.077
connection and
proliferation of stories

00:22:58.077 --> 00:22:59.660
that connect and
resonate with people.

00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:01.993
And I think being part of
that has been really exciting,

00:23:01.993 --> 00:23:04.600
because what I bet on was that
that was true, that diversity

00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:06.600
and narratives would
actually make a difference.

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:08.620
And that people
would meet me where

00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:11.292
I was, if I just
expected them to.

00:23:11.292 --> 00:23:12.875
And that's been true
in my experience.

00:23:12.875 --> 00:23:15.070
And I feel like that's
what we're seeing now,

00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:17.740
with trans visibility in media.

00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:20.360
And then of course, there's been
pop cultural representations

00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:22.370
like "Orange is the
New Black," and now

00:23:22.370 --> 00:23:24.390
"Transparent," where
we're just seeing

00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:26.190
more nuanced stories
about trans lives.

00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:29.560
So I'm excited that I think
that's going to continue.

00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:32.010
And I think the conversation's
become much more

00:23:32.010 --> 00:23:35.050
about what do trans people have
to say about gender broadly,

00:23:35.050 --> 00:23:37.740
rather than, wow, isn't it
so weird that some people are

00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:40.300
trapped in the wrong body and
now they find their new body

00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:42.987
and it's, woof, like that
was a real hard thing

00:23:42.987 --> 00:23:44.320
to think about for five minutes.

00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:47.757
Now I feel like people are
like, what's my gender?

00:23:47.757 --> 00:23:48.840
And what does gender mean?

00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:50.423
And you know,
especially with the rise

00:23:50.423 --> 00:23:52.170
of feminism in a
pop culture way,

00:23:52.170 --> 00:23:54.720
I think we're all talking about
gender more, which is great.

00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:56.060
And millennials, I
think specifically,

00:23:56.060 --> 00:23:58.360
are really interested in
gender, which is also great.

00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:01.450
So I think we're just in a very
amazing watershed moment, where

00:24:01.450 --> 00:24:02.810
all these things are combining.

00:24:02.810 --> 00:24:04.610
I think that's
going to continue.

00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:08.110
What I'm excited to see
more of is policy changes,

00:24:08.110 --> 00:24:10.280
especially for the more
marginalized among us.

00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:12.310
I think always,
people get forgotten

00:24:12.310 --> 00:24:14.490
in these kinds of moments.

00:24:14.490 --> 00:24:16.470
And I think
especially trans women

00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:19.580
of color, who are the
most adversely affected

00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:20.710
by transphobia.

00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:23.427
I'm hoping more and more
that those folks are

00:24:23.427 --> 00:24:25.260
going to get more
protections and that we're

00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:27.843
going to be more conscientious
about the violence that's still

00:24:27.843 --> 00:24:29.500
happening in these communities.

00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:30.680
That's my hope.

00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:34.387
Yes.

00:24:34.387 --> 00:24:35.848
AUDIENCE: You had
mentioned going

00:24:35.848 --> 00:24:37.796
into male dominated
environments,

00:24:37.796 --> 00:24:39.257
such as frat
houses, bath houses.

00:24:39.257 --> 00:24:41.205
Do you ever reveal
your background

00:24:41.205 --> 00:24:42.666
before going into
that environment?

00:24:42.666 --> 00:24:45.588
Do you find that skews
the overall experience

00:24:45.588 --> 00:24:48.384
or do you just sit
back and watch see--

00:24:48.384 --> 00:24:49.800
THOMAS PAGE MCBEE:
--what happens.

00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:50.680
AUDIENCE: Yeah, exactly.

00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:52.096
THOMAS PAGE MCBEE:
I think passing

00:24:52.096 --> 00:24:53.830
is a really interesting concept.

00:24:53.830 --> 00:24:55.210
And I think we're all passing.

00:24:55.210 --> 00:24:58.090
I mean, again my general
orientation in life

00:24:58.090 --> 00:25:00.212
is seeing the universal.

00:25:00.212 --> 00:25:02.420
So I think passing is
something I never thought about

00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:03.659
until I transitioned.

00:25:03.659 --> 00:25:06.200
And a lot of people feel really
uncomfortable with that word,

00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:07.410
which I totally understand.

00:25:07.410 --> 00:25:08.868
But I also feel
like over time I've

00:25:08.868 --> 00:25:11.120
realized that we're all
passing all the time.

00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:13.734
I mean, there's a way that
we're passing at work.

00:25:13.734 --> 00:25:15.650
We're all passing in
this room, that we're all

00:25:15.650 --> 00:25:18.110
passing with out families, that
we're passing in the street.

00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:19.568
And there's just--
it's really hard

00:25:19.568 --> 00:25:23.311
to be a fully-- every dimension
of yourself in every space.

00:25:23.311 --> 00:25:25.810
That being said, this project
specifically, the American Man

00:25:25.810 --> 00:25:30.140
project, is about being gonzo,
which is how I think of it.

00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:33.960
I'm really interested in how
men react to men without sort

00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:36.890
of knowing that there's
something more dynamic going on

00:25:36.890 --> 00:25:39.020
in my background.

00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:41.336
And so no, in this
particular case,

00:25:41.336 --> 00:25:42.460
I don't make a point of it.

00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:44.640
I'm really Google-able.

00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:46.057
You can easily
find out everything

00:25:46.057 --> 00:25:48.348
you need to know about my
life by looking me up online.

00:25:48.348 --> 00:25:49.700
So it's certainly not a secret.

00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:51.900
But I try as much as
possible to experiment

00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:56.199
with being in homo
social male spaces,

00:25:56.199 --> 00:25:57.990
and reflecting back
what that really means.

00:25:57.990 --> 00:25:59.760
And usually it's
really surprising.

00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:02.020
I think a lot of the things
you expect, of course,

00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:03.100
tend to be true.

00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:08.620
But I'm often pleasantly
surprised in male spaces.

00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:11.570
I've had so many moments in
like the locker room, hearing

00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:13.900
some super vulnerable
conversation between two dudes

00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:18.250
about a woman who's broken
somebody's heart or whatever.

00:26:18.250 --> 00:26:20.950
It's really next level and
there's sort of fragility

00:26:20.950 --> 00:26:24.000
there that I find
really interesting.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:24.830
So I don't know.

00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:27.730
Yeah, I don't make
a point to, I guess,

00:26:27.730 --> 00:26:31.010
reveal that I'm trans before
I hang out in those spaces.

00:26:31.010 --> 00:26:34.200
Though I think it would be
interesting to be in a space

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:36.380
where someone were
to know and how

00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:38.160
that might affect the situation.

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:39.995
Probably that will
happen at some point.

00:26:44.270 --> 00:26:45.210
Any other questions?

00:26:47.771 --> 00:26:48.270
Yes.

00:26:48.270 --> 00:26:50.254
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:50.254 --> 00:26:53.140
Have you been exploring both
sort of traditionally straight

00:26:53.140 --> 00:26:55.740
spaces and traditionally
queer spaces for men?

00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:57.590
And what kinds of
things do you see a--

00:26:57.590 --> 00:26:57.970
THOMAS PAGE MCBEE: --difference.

00:26:57.970 --> 00:26:58.520
Yeah.

00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:01.132
So, so far I've been
to a gay bathhouse,

00:27:01.132 --> 00:27:02.340
which was really interesting.

00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:04.637
What I was most
interested in, what

00:27:04.637 --> 00:27:06.470
I've been most interested
in in this project

00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:09.760
is things that scare me as
a man and as a trans man

00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:10.790
specifically.

00:27:10.790 --> 00:27:14.040
So I was very afraid to
be in a gay bath house,

00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:18.670
because I felt like my
physio-- my biology,

00:27:18.670 --> 00:27:21.740
my body physically might be sort
of revealing in some way that

00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:24.000
would be scary.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.420
And that really wasn't true.

00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:27.730
And that was really interesting.

00:27:27.730 --> 00:27:29.664
And also-- that one's online.

00:27:29.664 --> 00:27:30.330
You can read it.

00:27:30.330 --> 00:27:32.930
But basically, it was a
tough moment in my life,

00:27:32.930 --> 00:27:36.237
where my mom was very
ill and I hadn't really

00:27:36.237 --> 00:27:37.570
figured out a way to process it.

00:27:37.570 --> 00:27:40.530
And actually being in this
space with a bunch of guys

00:27:40.530 --> 00:27:42.760
who were cruising each other
and doing whatever else.

00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:46.000
But also a lot of
Hasidic guys were

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.154
at the Russian Turkish
baths down in-- Yeah.

00:27:48.154 --> 00:27:49.570
So it was like all
kinds of folks.

00:27:49.570 --> 00:27:53.540
And like coexisting together
in this really interesting way,

00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:56.637
these orthodox Jews and
then these gay guys,

00:27:56.637 --> 00:27:58.220
who were just there
to cruise at 10:00

00:27:58.220 --> 00:28:00.490
AM on a Sunday morning and me.

00:28:00.490 --> 00:28:03.900
And so it ended up being a
really beautiful experience,

00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:07.147
because it was just yet another
lesson that you just show up

00:28:07.147 --> 00:28:09.480
and you're yourself, and
however you are in that moment,

00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:10.021
there's room.

00:28:10.021 --> 00:28:12.360
And I was able to
process a lot of feelings

00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:14.500
actually in that moment.

00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:16.612
So that's been--
Yeah, I mean I don't

00:28:16.612 --> 00:28:19.070
think that there's some grand
statement I could make about,

00:28:19.070 --> 00:28:20.610
like gay men are
different in this way

00:28:20.610 --> 00:28:22.210
and straight men are
different in this way.

00:28:22.210 --> 00:28:23.210
I don't think so at all.

00:28:23.210 --> 00:28:25.543
But I think being able to
move in these different worlds

00:28:25.543 --> 00:28:27.670
and sort of reflecting
back in every moment, what

00:28:27.670 --> 00:28:30.620
those worlds look like has
been a really cool process.

00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:32.980
The boxing story, actually,
is a lot about class.

00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:35.420
Because I went to
this amateur boxing

00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:37.020
gym where a lot of
Wall Street guys

00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:39.650
were taking boxing lessons.

00:28:39.650 --> 00:28:42.700
And then also all of
these prize fighting

00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:44.200
dudes who are
putting their bodies

00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:46.995
on the line for like $500
are working really hard

00:28:46.995 --> 00:28:48.120
to try to make that happen.

00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:50.390
And there was a lot
of class tension

00:28:50.390 --> 00:28:52.320
in those spaces
between the men there.

00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:55.740
So I think it's like there's
all these intersections

00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:58.010
of different identities
happening at the same time.

00:28:58.010 --> 00:29:00.930
And maybe more than most people,
I'm very conscious of that

00:29:00.930 --> 00:29:02.904
and that's why I try
and reflect back.

00:29:06.250 --> 00:29:07.125
Any other questions?

00:29:10.030 --> 00:29:10.570
Yes.

00:29:10.570 --> 00:29:12.111
AUDIENCE: I'm kind
of like struggling

00:29:12.111 --> 00:29:14.736
to understand how to
like be intentional

00:29:14.736 --> 00:29:23.055
and to make myself I guess
I'm struggling to understand

00:29:23.055 --> 00:29:26.942
like how to achieve
those things.

00:29:26.942 --> 00:29:29.150
THOMAS PAGE MCBEE: It's like
a life process, I think.

00:29:29.150 --> 00:29:30.801
Yeah.

00:29:30.801 --> 00:29:34.466
Well, that's why I really think
like the first-- the thing

00:29:34.466 --> 00:29:36.840
I was most afraid of and the
reason I wrote this book was

00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:39.750
that these sort of terrible
definitions of being male

00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:40.630
were the only option.

00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:42.140
So that's why, in
a lot of ways, why

00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:43.870
I didn't transition
until so late in my life.

00:29:43.870 --> 00:29:45.953
I was really trying to be
like a masculine person,

00:29:45.953 --> 00:29:48.327
because that was
a way to be what

00:29:48.327 --> 00:29:50.910
I felt like I was without having
to actually move in the world

00:29:50.910 --> 00:29:52.576
as a man, which felt
really scary to me.

00:29:52.576 --> 00:29:56.300
Because I just had such negative
associations with being male.

00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:58.670
And so much of my
personal process

00:29:58.670 --> 00:30:01.030
was about sort of
realizing, I don't

00:30:01.030 --> 00:30:03.130
have to be just the things
that are sold to me.

00:30:03.130 --> 00:30:04.760
I don't have to
take on this role

00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:08.494
just because somebody says,
this is what men do or don't do.

00:30:08.494 --> 00:30:09.910
And maybe-- and
for me a lot of it

00:30:09.910 --> 00:30:11.493
was like mining what
was uncomfortable

00:30:11.493 --> 00:30:14.090
or what didn't feel right,
and saying, you know,

00:30:14.090 --> 00:30:15.470
I'm not going to do it this way.

00:30:15.470 --> 00:30:16.670
And it's not so simple.

00:30:16.670 --> 00:30:19.312
It wasn't like, let me eschew
all symbols of masculinity.

00:30:19.312 --> 00:30:21.770
There are things about being
a man and being in a male body

00:30:21.770 --> 00:30:24.230
and being masculine
that I really like.

00:30:24.230 --> 00:30:26.349
But it's more just
that I review them.

00:30:26.349 --> 00:30:28.640
And when something comes up
and makes me uncomfortable,

00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:29.764
I sit with it for a minute.

00:30:29.764 --> 00:30:31.270
And I'm like, well,
what is making

00:30:31.270 --> 00:30:32.630
uncomfortable about this?

00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:36.270
I think I'm much more
nurturing now that I'm male.

00:30:36.270 --> 00:30:39.830
Because the way that I feel
about being nurturing as

00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:41.740
a man feels really good to me.

00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:43.675
And it's a different
way of-- that way

00:30:43.675 --> 00:30:47.040
of being nurturing, being
protective and doing things

00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:49.910
to care for people in a way
that's much more sort of hands

00:30:49.910 --> 00:30:51.690
on, that feels
really good to me.

00:30:51.690 --> 00:30:53.410
I've opted in to that.

00:30:53.410 --> 00:30:55.340
But I won't opt in
to other aspects

00:30:55.340 --> 00:30:56.940
of what being masculine
in our culture

00:30:56.940 --> 00:30:58.590
means that make me
feel uncomfortable.

00:30:58.590 --> 00:31:01.110
Like, I'm not going be
disrespectful to women

00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:03.680
because that asserts
my masculinity somehow

00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:04.260
to other men.

00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:07.620
So I think it's a lot about
when something comes up

00:31:07.620 --> 00:31:09.750
that doesn't feel good,
sort of figuring out, well,

00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:11.750
what is that and why
doesn't it feel good and do

00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:14.930
I want to really be that
and that sort of thing.

00:31:14.930 --> 00:31:17.510
And actually listening a
lot to women specifically,

00:31:17.510 --> 00:31:19.635
because I think we're having
a lot of conversations

00:31:19.635 --> 00:31:22.630
in our culture right
now about cat calling

00:31:22.630 --> 00:31:26.001
and what it's like at work
and leaning in or whatever.

00:31:26.001 --> 00:31:27.250
And why do we have to lean in?

00:31:27.250 --> 00:31:28.400
Or can women have it all?

00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:30.990
And it's like, those questions
aren't irrelevant to men

00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:35.120
because we're all participating
in the same dynamic.

00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:39.310
So being willing to look at
something just because it makes

00:31:39.310 --> 00:31:41.580
you a better person, not
just because it's like, oh,

00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:44.250
I might want to help out
my girlfriend or my mom

00:31:44.250 --> 00:31:46.560
or my sister or whatever,
by thinking about this.

00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:48.650
So that's where I would start.

00:31:48.650 --> 00:31:50.736
But a lot of it's just,
again, making the fact

00:31:50.736 --> 00:31:52.360
that men have a gender
a visible thing.

00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:55.080
Because then women for years,
because of feminism, have,

00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:57.650
I think, really had a way to
engage with the idea of gender.

00:31:57.650 --> 00:32:01.560
Like, if a woman wants to
wear really feminine clothes

00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:04.580
and dress up and whatever and
she wants to opt into that

00:32:04.580 --> 00:32:06.560
to go to work one
day, maybe she's

00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:09.780
making a really conscious
feminist choice to do that.

00:32:09.780 --> 00:32:12.420
I think men haven't had
the same thoughts around,

00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:15.370
well, do I want to be whatever.

00:32:15.370 --> 00:32:17.200
Do I want to take
boxing classes?

00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:19.400
Why?

00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:22.420
Whatever I'm doing, is it for
a reason that feels good to me?

00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:26.510
Or am I choosing consciously to
do this thing because I want to

00:32:26.510 --> 00:32:28.880
or am I just doing it
because I'm supposed to

00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:31.330
and actually it's
really constricting

00:32:31.330 --> 00:32:33.220
and maybe even harmful
to other people.

00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:36.200
So that's where I started.

00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:36.935
Yeah.

00:32:36.935 --> 00:32:40.400
AUDIENCE: So my assistant
had a baby some months ago.

00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:42.050
And when I told
people about it, they

00:32:42.050 --> 00:32:44.360
would ask, the first thing
they would always ask,

00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:45.350
was it a boy or girl.

00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:48.072
And it always annoyed
me because that is not

00:32:48.072 --> 00:32:49.310
the most important thing.

00:32:49.310 --> 00:32:51.110
And so I wouldn't
tell them and I

00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:52.620
noticed it would
drive them crazy.

00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:54.632
And they would not stop asking.

00:32:54.632 --> 00:32:56.600
So, of course, the
more this happened,

00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:58.568
the less I wanted to tell them.

00:32:58.568 --> 00:33:01.028
I was wondering if you
had any thoughts on this,

00:33:01.028 --> 00:33:04.250
like the really strong
gender socialization.

00:33:04.250 --> 00:33:06.000
THOMAS PAGE MCBEE:
Isn't it so interesting

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:09.230
that what we're really asking
is, what kind of person

00:33:09.230 --> 00:33:10.760
is this person going to be.

00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:14.340
like we can somehow, by
knowing if the person's born

00:33:14.340 --> 00:33:16.752
with one body or another body.

00:33:16.752 --> 00:33:18.640
I agree that it's a
really troubling thing.

00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:22.300
I really like when parents
don't find out or wait.

00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:24.310
But I also think,
like all things,

00:33:24.310 --> 00:33:27.380
there's sort of a-- I think
it's overly idealistic to assume

00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:32.020
we won't put expectations on
our children or on each other,

00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:34.747
based on what gender
we think a person is.

00:33:34.747 --> 00:33:35.830
I think, of course, we do.

00:33:35.830 --> 00:33:40.030
Life is complicated and it's a
way we make sense of the world.

00:33:40.030 --> 00:33:42.651
And these are
systems of operating.

00:33:42.651 --> 00:33:44.150
Again, I think it
goes back to like,

00:33:44.150 --> 00:33:46.095
is there a way to
integrate and to understand

00:33:46.095 --> 00:33:47.085
that this is a paradox.

00:33:47.085 --> 00:33:49.330
Where on one hand,
gender is probably

00:33:49.330 --> 00:33:52.100
pretty innate for most
of us, and for all of us.

00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:53.710
And most of us
are born in a body

00:33:53.710 --> 00:33:57.010
that we don't want to change.

00:33:57.010 --> 00:34:00.050
But even so, we need
to operate in a way

00:34:00.050 --> 00:34:03.924
that we understand the cultural
and institutional expectations

00:34:03.924 --> 00:34:05.340
that come along
with those bodies.

00:34:05.340 --> 00:34:07.410
And it's very
restricting to all of us

00:34:07.410 --> 00:34:10.750
when we assume that because
somebody looks one way,

00:34:10.750 --> 00:34:13.710
therefore everything about
them is going to be this way.

00:34:13.710 --> 00:34:16.739
So I guess to me, there's
not some simple solution

00:34:16.739 --> 00:34:20.360
of like well, if we just
raise our children agendered,

00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:22.620
then somehow that will
solve our problems.

00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:23.510
I think probably not.

00:34:23.510 --> 00:34:25.218
I think probably the
best thing we can do

00:34:25.218 --> 00:34:28.199
is teach our kids that gender
is complex and nuanced.

00:34:28.199 --> 00:34:30.380
And there's no way right
way to be and encourage

00:34:30.380 --> 00:34:31.659
them to just be themselves.

00:34:31.659 --> 00:34:35.270
And model that for our
kids and for each other.

00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:39.003
Yes.

00:34:39.003 --> 00:34:39.919
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:34:42.204 --> 00:34:43.620
THOMAS PAGE MCBEE:
That's really--

00:34:43.620 --> 00:34:44.460
no one's asked me that.

00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:45.376
It's a great question.

00:34:45.376 --> 00:34:47.510
Thank you.

00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:51.670
I think a lot of queer
people have a lot of tattoos,

00:34:51.670 --> 00:34:53.730
and probably a lot
for the same reason.

00:34:53.730 --> 00:34:58.030
It's a way to be in the world
in a way that feels intentional

00:34:58.030 --> 00:34:59.860
and sort of claim
your body as your own

00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:01.985
in a space where people
don't always understand it.

00:35:04.330 --> 00:35:07.230
For me personally, as
just a human being,

00:35:07.230 --> 00:35:09.380
I have found tattooing--
like ritual in general

00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:12.690
is a very-- it's a way for
me to operate culturally,

00:35:12.690 --> 00:35:15.450
so that the world
makes sense to me.

00:35:15.450 --> 00:35:19.080
These tattoos are
a lion and a lamb

00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:21.372
and I got them in
the last six months.

00:35:21.372 --> 00:35:23.580
And it was a lot for me
about a few different things.

00:35:23.580 --> 00:35:26.610
One was feeling secure
enough professionally

00:35:26.610 --> 00:35:30.530
to get "jobs stoppers," which
I always promised myself

00:35:30.530 --> 00:35:33.900
I would do to mark that.

00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:36.450
And also like, the idea
of the lion and the lamb,

00:35:36.450 --> 00:35:38.490
which, I don't know,
ironically actually,

00:35:38.490 --> 00:35:39.970
this is not in the story.

00:35:39.970 --> 00:35:41.720
I don't think it's a
lion and lamb at all,

00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:42.660
I've later found out.

00:35:42.660 --> 00:35:46.030
It's a lamb and like a fox
or something in the Bible.

00:35:46.030 --> 00:35:47.700
But just the concept,
I guess, that

00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:50.740
like we need to integrate
both parts of ourselves,

00:35:50.740 --> 00:35:53.260
our fierceness
and our gentleness

00:35:53.260 --> 00:35:56.950
in order to operate
in a fully human way.

00:35:56.950 --> 00:35:57.920
I really liked that.

00:35:57.920 --> 00:35:59.970
And so every sort
of moment of my life

00:35:59.970 --> 00:36:02.680
that I've had some sort of big
realization about the person I

00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:05.350
am in the world, I usually mark
it with some sort of tattoo.

00:36:05.350 --> 00:36:09.570
And I find the ritual of
that very-- it's a great way

00:36:09.570 --> 00:36:10.342
to mark time.

00:36:10.342 --> 00:36:11.800
You know, time
isn't linear anyway.

00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:12.508
We all know that.

00:36:12.508 --> 00:36:14.950
So how do we mark our
lives in a way that

00:36:14.950 --> 00:36:17.320
contains them in some way and
there's a story behind it.

00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:21.270
The best part about writing this
book, really, was that like,

00:36:21.270 --> 00:36:23.790
I got to not only assert
my identity in a world that

00:36:23.790 --> 00:36:25.460
didn't always
understand it, but also

00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:28.890
to assert my understanding of
just the way life operates.

00:36:28.890 --> 00:36:31.970
It's a book that really--
time is kind of like always

00:36:31.970 --> 00:36:33.319
in a vortex.

00:36:33.319 --> 00:36:35.610
And I think that's how memory
works and how life works.

00:36:35.610 --> 00:36:38.450
We are organized much more
thematically than we think

00:36:38.450 --> 00:36:41.920
and much less in a
way that's linear.

00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:44.490
It's less spatial,
it's more thematic.

00:36:44.490 --> 00:36:46.950
So in a lot of ways,
I think that's just

00:36:46.950 --> 00:36:49.720
tattooing, writing a
book, being an artist

00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:52.760
in any way is about being
able to operate in that realm.

00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:58.290
Any other questions?

00:36:58.290 --> 00:36:58.790
Yes.

00:36:58.790 --> 00:37:01.190
AUDIENCE: Do you
have any comments

00:37:01.190 --> 00:37:05.030
about non-standard genders?

00:37:05.030 --> 00:37:07.140
Non cis or [INAUDIBLE] female?

00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:08.140
THOMAS PAGE MCBEE: Yeah.

00:37:08.140 --> 00:37:13.075
I mean, what are you
really asking me?

00:37:13.075 --> 00:37:16.532
AUDIENCE: I'm inviting you
to say something about that.

00:37:16.532 --> 00:37:19.840
I don't have an actual question.

00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:23.480
How one could
construct an identity

00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:24.960
as [INAUDIBLE] or whatever.

00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:25.960
THOMAS PAGE MCBEE: Yeah.

00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:28.970
I mean I think gender
is complex and nuanced.

00:37:28.970 --> 00:37:30.590
And we all-- I really
believe there's

00:37:30.590 --> 00:37:33.120
something innate to gender,
which is so interesting to me

00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:33.620
anyway.

00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:35.680
Because I came of age
in the queer '90s,

00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:39.750
where it's was very
like, being post gender

00:37:39.750 --> 00:37:41.870
was kind of-- that
was the big idea.

00:37:41.870 --> 00:37:44.080
And I spent a lot of time
trying to be post gender

00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:46.050
and it just didn't
work for me personally.

00:37:46.050 --> 00:37:48.880
I really felt like I had
a gender and it was male.

00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:50.480
And that was complicated.

00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:54.071
But I think a lot of people are
innately in some other space

00:37:54.071 --> 00:37:54.570
with that.

00:37:54.570 --> 00:37:56.620
And I think that's really
cool and important too.

00:37:56.620 --> 00:38:01.210
And that no gender
is obviously being

00:38:01.210 --> 00:38:04.781
able to pass as male in a male
body is really a lot easier.

00:38:04.781 --> 00:38:06.530
And again, that goes
back to the privilege

00:38:06.530 --> 00:38:08.155
and being able to
pass in a lot of ways

00:38:08.155 --> 00:38:11.340
as a woman in a female
body is really easy too

00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:14.260
in a different way with
[INAUDIBLE] sexism.

00:38:14.260 --> 00:38:16.950
So we're really privileged in
those ways and the people who

00:38:16.950 --> 00:38:18.690
are not conforming aren't.

00:38:18.690 --> 00:38:20.340
So just in the same
way that I think

00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:22.010
we need to make space
for other stories,

00:38:22.010 --> 00:38:24.590
like about trans
bodies, we certainly

00:38:24.590 --> 00:38:26.310
make space for people's
gender identities

00:38:26.310 --> 00:38:28.574
that aren't as conforming
to those standards.

00:38:28.574 --> 00:38:29.740
I mean gender is a spectrum.

00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:30.760
We all know that.

00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:32.816
So I guess the only
thing I have to say

00:38:32.816 --> 00:38:34.190
about it is that
those are really

00:38:34.190 --> 00:38:36.070
important identities too.

00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:39.311
Just doesn't happen to be mine.

00:38:39.311 --> 00:38:39.810
Yeah.

00:38:39.810 --> 00:38:42.010
AUDIENCE: What's next
for your own [INAUDIBLE]?

00:38:44.392 --> 00:38:45.850
THOMAS PAGE MCBEE:
I think I really

00:38:45.850 --> 00:38:50.790
love that I can change
the conversation

00:38:50.790 --> 00:38:52.701
to be more than
about being trans.

00:38:52.701 --> 00:38:54.950
Like, I think early on-- and
it just sort of parallels

00:38:54.950 --> 00:38:55.610
my own life.

00:38:55.610 --> 00:38:58.360
I really was interested in
being trans because that's

00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:00.114
what I was operating
and operating

00:39:00.114 --> 00:39:02.030
from a place of thinking
about it all the time

00:39:02.030 --> 00:39:04.460
in the first couple of
years of my transition.

00:39:04.460 --> 00:39:07.560
And over time, I've realized
that, just like my body,

00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:09.980
in the world isn't
read as a trans body,

00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:11.980
my interest in the
world is much more about

00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:14.120
what does it mean
to be a male body.

00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:17.784
And so, I continue
to, at least for now,

00:39:17.784 --> 00:39:19.325
really be interested
in that question

00:39:19.325 --> 00:39:21.980
and thinking about
how being male

00:39:21.980 --> 00:39:25.030
affects the space around
me and vice versa.

00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:27.080
So I think in my
construction, I'm

00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:30.176
still constructing my male
self and being the kind of man

00:39:30.176 --> 00:39:32.300
I want to be, not necessarily
the kind of trans man

00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:34.610
I want to be, though
that's clearly related.

00:39:34.610 --> 00:39:38.050
And so being able to talk to
men and ask these questions

00:39:38.050 --> 00:39:40.576
and be in male spaces
and bring this stuff up,

00:39:40.576 --> 00:39:42.700
is still something I'm
negotiating and figuring out

00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:43.570
how to do well.

00:39:43.570 --> 00:39:45.990
And I want to keep doing
it until I nail it,

00:39:45.990 --> 00:39:47.490
so probably for the
rest of my life.

00:39:53.370 --> 00:39:55.040
Anything else you guys?

00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:57.273
This is such a great group.

00:39:57.273 --> 00:39:59.160
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] question.

00:40:01.870 --> 00:40:07.152
I remember being 17 and getting
facial hair for the first time.

00:40:07.152 --> 00:40:10.100
I'm thinking is this cool?

00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:10.943
Is this annoying?

00:40:10.943 --> 00:40:13.408
It literally took
me years to decide

00:40:13.408 --> 00:40:16.859
if I wanted to be clean
shaven or have a beard.

00:40:16.859 --> 00:40:19.324
I imagine you must have
gone through the same things

00:40:19.324 --> 00:40:21.789
with a slightly
different twist on it.

00:40:21.789 --> 00:40:23.210
What was that like?

00:40:23.210 --> 00:40:25.710
THOMAS PAGE MCBEE: I mean so
every Halloween until this one,

00:40:25.710 --> 00:40:27.584
well, not until this
one, until the last few,

00:40:27.584 --> 00:40:29.750
I always was
something where I got

00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:32.140
to have a fake beard,
like a mascara beard.

00:40:32.140 --> 00:40:34.150
I was really committed
to the beard situation.

00:40:34.150 --> 00:40:37.450
So as soon as I was
on testosterone,

00:40:37.450 --> 00:40:40.466
I immediately was trying to grow
a beard because that was like,

00:40:40.466 --> 00:40:42.090
I didn't have a lot
of ideas about what

00:40:42.090 --> 00:40:42.870
I want it to look like.

00:40:42.870 --> 00:40:44.453
Its kind of an
interesting thing to be

00:40:44.453 --> 00:40:46.930
like kind of reborn in a body
that you already live in.

00:40:46.930 --> 00:40:48.680
And testosterone
especially is interesting

00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:50.970
because it really
is just turning

00:40:50.970 --> 00:40:52.380
on genes that already exist.

00:40:52.380 --> 00:40:54.700
So like I really had a
man inside me literally.

00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:57.337
And we all have, you
know, women and men,

00:40:57.337 --> 00:40:59.420
female and male bodies
inside of our bodies, which

00:40:59.420 --> 00:41:02.430
is interesting to think
about, at least to me.

00:41:02.430 --> 00:41:05.730
So I had no idea what
my body would do,

00:41:05.730 --> 00:41:08.050
and so I was worried
about not having a beard.

00:41:08.050 --> 00:41:09.466
And also I was
worried about going

00:41:09.466 --> 00:41:11.640
bald, which might still happen.

00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:14.070
So like all men, I think those
are the two primary things

00:41:14.070 --> 00:41:17.710
I was thinking about during
coming into adulthood.

00:41:17.710 --> 00:41:20.200
But my process was
very accelerated.

00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:22.570
So I was really excited
to try to grow a beard.

00:41:22.570 --> 00:41:24.170
I think it's worked out OK.

00:41:24.170 --> 00:41:25.740
I feel very lucky.

00:41:25.740 --> 00:41:27.749
But yeah, for me,
that was something--

00:41:27.749 --> 00:41:30.040
it was one small thing that
was really important to me.

00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:32.414
A lot of other things-- people
have different things that

00:41:32.414 --> 00:41:34.420
are important to them
that they are hoping

00:41:34.420 --> 00:41:36.610
will happen for their
bodies, like we all have.

00:41:36.610 --> 00:41:38.643
And that for me-- facial
hair was one for me

00:41:38.643 --> 00:41:41.010
that I was really excited about.

00:41:41.010 --> 00:41:42.510
But if I hadn't had
a beard, I would

00:41:42.510 --> 00:41:45.070
lived, like all guys
who can't grow beards.

00:41:45.070 --> 00:41:47.460
You obviously picked to
go with the beard route

00:41:47.460 --> 00:41:48.820
and it worked out well for you.

00:41:48.820 --> 00:41:49.736
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:54.282 --> 00:41:55.740
THOMAS PAGE MCBEE:
Other questions.

00:41:55.740 --> 00:41:57.022
Yes.

00:41:57.022 --> 00:41:59.427
AUDIENCE: Have you felt
that being on testoterone

00:41:59.427 --> 00:42:03.034
has changed anything
about who you

00:42:03.034 --> 00:42:05.257
are as a person,
your personality?

00:42:05.257 --> 00:42:06.840
THOMAS PAGE MCBEE:
I think that that's

00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:08.090
a really interesting question.

00:42:08.090 --> 00:42:09.570
I think about a lot.

00:42:09.570 --> 00:42:12.840
I think it's extremely hard
to separate all of this stuff

00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:13.670
from each other.

00:42:13.670 --> 00:42:17.530
I mean, in the years since
I've been on testosterone,

00:42:17.530 --> 00:42:19.790
I've moved to New
York from New England.

00:42:19.790 --> 00:42:21.910
I ended a very
long relationship.

00:42:21.910 --> 00:42:25.310
I had a lot of things
happen in my career.

00:42:25.310 --> 00:42:27.400
I mean, so many
things have happened.

00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:29.400
And I really became an adult.

00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:32.760
So it's really hard for me to
know, well, this part of it

00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:35.950
came from testosterone and
this part of it-- I don't know.

00:42:35.950 --> 00:42:41.040
I do think that-- I do think
hormones affect our bodies.

00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:43.330
And I do think that there
are ways for me personally

00:42:43.330 --> 00:42:46.450
that testosterone's probably
affected how I behave.

00:42:46.450 --> 00:42:48.900
It's just really hard
to know exactly what.

00:42:48.900 --> 00:42:53.240
And also it's like
probably, yes.

00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:57.177
Probably for example, I
probably am more assertive.

00:42:57.177 --> 00:42:58.760
On the other hand,
am I more assertive

00:42:58.760 --> 00:43:00.660
because I'm on testosterone
or because people expect me

00:43:00.660 --> 00:43:02.680
to be more assertive
or am I because I'm

00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:05.280
rewarded for being assertive
in ways I wasn't before?

00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:07.010
I just don't know the answer.

00:43:07.010 --> 00:43:09.142
I think my relationship
certainly with like--

00:43:09.142 --> 00:43:10.600
and I've heard a
lot of people talk

00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:13.320
about this, with
crying, is different.

00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:17.090
It's harder for me to
cry, though I still can.

00:43:17.090 --> 00:43:20.347
But it's just little bit
more difficult to do,

00:43:20.347 --> 00:43:21.430
like literally physically.

00:43:21.430 --> 00:43:23.890
Like I feel like I have to
cry and I can't sometimes.

00:43:23.890 --> 00:43:26.960
I've had to relearn how,
which is interesting.

00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:31.090
And then when I do, it's way
more intense but way shorter.

00:43:31.090 --> 00:43:32.029
So what is that?

00:43:32.029 --> 00:43:32.570
I don't know.

00:43:32.570 --> 00:43:33.870
I don't think that's social.

00:43:33.870 --> 00:43:35.828
I think that's something
physical with my body,

00:43:35.828 --> 00:43:38.250
but I can't figure out
exactly what's going on.

00:43:38.250 --> 00:43:40.019
So, yes, a lot of
it, I don't know.

00:43:40.019 --> 00:43:41.310
It's really hard to pull apart.

00:43:41.310 --> 00:43:43.565
I definitely think,
my honest answer

00:43:43.565 --> 00:43:45.380
is I am absolutely
positive there are ways

00:43:45.380 --> 00:43:47.277
that I've been affected
by these hormones.

00:43:47.277 --> 00:43:48.610
I just don't know what they are.

00:43:56.370 --> 00:43:57.360
Any other question?

00:44:00.580 --> 00:44:01.081
Cool.

00:44:01.081 --> 00:44:02.455
Well, you guys
have been awesome.

00:44:02.455 --> 00:44:04.060
This have been a
really great group.

00:44:04.060 --> 00:44:05.268
MALE SPEAKER: Thanks so much.

00:44:05.268 --> 00:44:07.060
If there are other
questions, we still

00:44:07.060 --> 00:44:09.006
have the room for a few minutes.

00:44:09.006 --> 00:44:11.027
There are books in the back.

00:44:11.027 --> 00:44:12.610
If you would like
to get them signed--

00:44:12.610 --> 00:44:13.100
THOMAS PAGE MCBEE: Yeah.

00:44:13.100 --> 00:44:13.860
MALE SPEAKER: --now
is a good time.

00:44:13.860 --> 00:44:14.890
THOMAS PAGE MCBEE: Please
feel free to buy a book it

00:44:14.890 --> 00:44:16.033
if you like.

00:44:16.033 --> 00:44:18.470
And thanks so much, you guys.

00:44:18.470 --> 00:44:21.434
[APPLAUSE]
