well I hope that my work and the work of

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490
well I hope that my work and the work of
 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.240
well I hope that my work and the work of
my colleagues helps people to understand

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250
my colleagues helps people to understand
 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.470
my colleagues helps people to understand
that dolphins are sentient beings with

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480
that dolphins are sentient beings with
 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.609
that dolphins are sentient beings with
lives to lead and I think that it's time

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619
lives to lead and I think that it's time
 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.359
lives to lead and I think that it's time
to sort of think about dolphins and

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369
to sort of think about dolphins and
 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.820
to sort of think about dolphins and
other animals in a way that shifts our

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830
other animals in a way that shifts our
 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.740
other animals in a way that shifts our
perspective away from viewing them as

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:32.750
perspective away from viewing them as
 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.470
perspective away from viewing them as
objects and commodities to actual beings

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480
objects and commodities to actual beings
 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.860
objects and commodities to actual beings
with lives to lead everything we know

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870
with lives to lead everything we know
 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.260
with lives to lead everything we know
about dolphins and their intelligence

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270
about dolphins and their intelligence
 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.220
about dolphins and their intelligence
their social lives their cultural lives

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230
their social lives their cultural lives
 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.369
their social lives their cultural lives
their emotionality their self-awareness

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379
their emotionality their self-awareness
 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.389
their emotionality their self-awareness
tells us that these are beings on a par

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399
tells us that these are beings on a par
 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.529
tells us that these are beings on a par
with humans in terms of their ability to

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539
with humans in terms of their ability to
 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.660
with humans in terms of their ability to
suffer and given that I've given the

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670
suffer and given that I've given the
 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.920
suffer and given that I've given the
fact that our species tends to say that

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930
fact that our species tends to say that
 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.240
fact that our species tends to say that
we love dolphins the way we treat them

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250
we love dolphins the way we treat them
 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.280
we love dolphins the way we treat them
is really quite appalling so the way we

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290
is really quite appalling so the way we
 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.270
is really quite appalling so the way we
treat them and how we claim we feel

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280
treat them and how we claim we feel
 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.810
treat them and how we claim we feel
about them are totally at odds and I

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820
about them are totally at odds and I
 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.030
about them are totally at odds and I
hope that my research helps people to

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040
hope that my research helps people to
 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.679
hope that my research helps people to
understand who they are and perhaps come

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689
understand who they are and perhaps come
 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.319
understand who they are and perhaps come
to realize that we shouldn't be treating

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329
to realize that we shouldn't be treating
 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.420
to realize that we shouldn't be treating
them as objects but rather a sentient

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430
them as objects but rather a sentient
 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.530
them as objects but rather a sentient
beings

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540
 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.600
