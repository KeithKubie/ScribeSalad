00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:07.280
Sometimes, in the history of engineering,
physicists make their way into the story.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.240
Consider, for example: John Bardeen.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:16.400
You might not have heard of him, but Bardeen
is the only person in all of history to win
the Nobel Prize in Physics twice.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.320
He shared the prize once in 1956 and again
in 1972.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.440
Both times, he was involved in discoveries
that made clever use of materials for electrical
engineering.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.700
The first prize was for his work on the
development of the transistor,

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:36.400
and the second was for describing a way to
allow certain materials to conduct electricity with
no resistance, called superconductivity.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:42.700
Superconductivity is tricky to achieve, but
it might allow us transport electricity with
nearly perfect efficiency in the future.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.300
Transistors, meanwhile, are electrical components
that have already revolutionized society.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.800
They form the basis of all modern computing.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.560
And at their heart are semiconductors.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:01:02.540
[Theme Music]

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:09.920
As the name implies, semiconductors are in
between materials that conduct electricity
and materials that are totally non-conducting.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:16.520
A classic example would be silicon, which
is so commonly used as a semiconductor that
Silicon Valley was named after it.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.180
As we’ll see, semiconductors have been transforming
the face of technology for decades.

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.240
On its own, silicon doesn’t conduct electricity
very well.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.920
It has no free charges, like free electrons,
in it to carry a current.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.080
But you can alter the structure of silicon
on an atomic level to change that.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.940
First, you replace a few of the atoms in a
layer of silicon with phosphorus atoms.

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.540
Those phosphorus atoms each carry one more
electron than a silicon atom would have,

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.040
which introduces more negatively-charged
electrons into the material.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.400
Those extra electrons aren’t bound to any
of the silicon atoms and are therefore free,
negative charges.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.440
For that reason, we call this an N-type semiconductor
– “N” for negative.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:02.320
On the other hand, if you switch some of the
silicon atoms with boron atoms, it creates a
relative lack of electrons in the material.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.140
The boron atom has one less outer electron
than the silicon atom it’s replacing.

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.450
The places where those electrons are absent
are called holes.

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:17.060
The lack of negative charge creates regions of
free positive charge, so we call this arrangement
a P-type semiconductor.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:24.480
Holes can move around and be transported
in a material, just like the absence of water in a
sealed container – a level, for example –

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.460
forms a bubble whose location you can
keep track of.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:33.120
You can think of holes as effectively “positive charges”
that can be filled by the presence of an electron.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.580
When that happens, the space left behind by
that electron creates a new hole.

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.560
Now, on their own, those P- and N-type semiconductors
aren’t all that exciting.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:47.780
Unlike pure silicon, which is an insulator,
they’ll be weakly conducting because they now
have free charges moving around.

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:55.520
But things get really interesting when you put
them together – like if you have both P and N type 
conductors sandwiched together in a circuit.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.300
Normally in electrical circuits, the electrons
flow from the negative terminal to the positive.

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:05.880
Remember that the current is defined to flow
in the opposite direction, so it travels from
positive to negative.

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:11.620
One thing you can do by sandwiching both
types of semiconductors is to stop the current
in a circuit from flowing altogether.

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:21.080
If you put the N-type semiconductor on the positive
terminal side, and the P-type semiconductor on the
negative terminal side, together they stop the current,

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.800
even though on their own, they’d each be
weakly conductive.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:30.260
It works because each semiconductor’s extra
charges are the opposite of the terminal it’s next to.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:36.660
All the negatively charged electrons in the
N type semiconductor are drawn towards the
positive terminal of the circuit.

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:41.420
And all the holes in the P type semiconductor are
drawn to the negative terminal of the cell.

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.600
Since the effective charges are being pulled
away from the area between the semiconductors,

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:51.340
you end up with a gap between the two plates
where charge can’t be transported across,
called a depleted region.

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:57.440
Since there are no free charges to transport
a current across that gap, an electrical current
can’t pass through it.

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.340
So if you arrange P- and N-type semiconductors
this way around, you can stop a flow of current.

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:09.040
But, if you arrange them the other way around,
with the P-type near the positive terminal and the
N-type near the negative terminal,

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.340
now the electrons and the holes are drawn
towards each other.

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:19.400
In this case, the extra electrons from the
N-type fill the holes in the P-type, and the new
holes spring up where the electrons used to be.

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:25.660
This kind of cascade can happen throughout
the entire circuit, again and again until you have
electrons flowing much as before.

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:30.900
In other words, in this arrangement the
current can now travel through where the N
and P layers meet.

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:39.860
The purpose of N and P type semiconductors put
together is the simplest form of what we call a diode,
which is basically a one-way enforcer of electrical current.

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:44.900
It allows current to flow in one direction,
but stops it from flowing in the opposite
direction.

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:49.980
It just depends on how you insert the semiconductors
relative to the terminals of your voltage supply –

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:53.440
whether that’s a battery, an
electrical outlet, or something else.

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.800
Being able to control the flow of a current
can be really useful.

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:01.790
For example, you might have an alternating
current, or AC signal flowing through a circuit,

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:04.680
where the direction of the current changes
back and forth.

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:10.560
But many electrical components need a direct
current, or DC, with a flow of current in only one
direction.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:16.520
In the right arrangement, diodes can be used
to convert a wavy, AC current into nice simple
DC current.

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.380
The flow of charge in the DC part of the current
always goes the same way,

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:24.400
and the positive and negative ends of the
output remain the same, like a battery.

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.680
So, diodes are handy for controlling the direction
of a current.

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:32.110
But you can do even more if you put three
semiconductors together in a sandwich.

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:36.460
You have two options for this type of sandwich:
P-N-P, or N-P-N.

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:41.920
In both cases, the middle layer effectively
creates a diode with each of the outer layers,

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:45.020
with each diode allowing current to flow in
the opposite direction.

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:51.050
This may not sound terribly useful, because
together, the three semiconductor layers are
restricting flow both ways.

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:53.380
Unless, that is, you add a second current.

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:56.229
Let’s say you have an N-P-N sandwich connected
to a battery.

00:05:56.229 --> 00:06:00.960
The current can’t flow through it, because
you have a positive terminal hooked up to
an N layer.

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:07.800
The electrons in that layer will be attracted
to the positive terminal, while the holes in the
P layer are attracted to the other N layer.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:11.900
So you end up with a depleted region between
them, and the current is going nowhere.

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:13.580
But here’s the incredible thing.

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:20.220
If you apply just a small current that flows
from the middle plate to the N layer on the same
side as the first battery’s negative terminal,

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:26.240
the electrons moving into the P layer fill the
depleted region between it and the other N layer.

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:32.800
So that gap the electrons couldn’t cross
before disappears, and the original larger current
is free to flow across the whole sandwich.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:41.500
In other words, you’ve created an electrical switch
– a sort of gateway – that requires just a tiny current
to control the flow of a larger current.

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.820
And it works for P-N-P arrangements, too.

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:48.820
This arrangement of semiconductors, that might
seem so functionless at first, is a transistor.

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:55.900
And the fact that it allows you to control how
current flows in a circuit makes it one of the most
important components of the electronic age.

00:06:55.900 --> 00:07:01.540
Since transistors use smaller currents to
influence the on or off states of the larger
currents flowing through the wire,

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:06.260
they form the basis of the binary system of
1s and 0s that computers rely on.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:10.740
All the marvels of computers and computer
chips, including your ability to watch this video,

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:14.500
depend on semiconductors and the transistors
we make from them!

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:19.060
So, that’s how materials like semiconductors
can direct the flow of electrical power.

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:22.560
But semiconductors can be used to generate
electrical currents, too!

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:28.300
And that ability has allowed us to take
advantage of an incredibly useful source of clean,
renewable energy.

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:35.360
To see how this works, let’s go back to
a simpler diode set up, with a P-type and
N-type semiconductor put together.

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:38.280
This time, you don’t connect the two sides
to a power supply.

00:07:38.289 --> 00:07:42.660
Instead, you attach it to a device you want
to power, like a small electrical motor.

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:48.560
Remember, the N-type will have an abundance
of free negative charges and the P-type will
have an abundance of free holes.

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:55.530
There’s no voltage being applied across the
junction between the two types, so the electrons of
the N-type will naturally fill the holes in the P-type.

00:07:55.530 --> 00:08:00.060
This creates a depleted region at the interface
between the two semiconductors.

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:06.560
There are no free charges because the electrons
become weakly bound to atoms when they fill
the holes that were in the P-type.

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:12.040
The N-type has a small region with some positively
charged atoms from the absence of those electrons,

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:17.780
while the P-type has a small region with some
negative charge from those extra electrons
it picked up.

00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:21.080
These opposite charges set up an electric
field across the gap.

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:29.600
If there were any free electrons in this field, they’d be
driven away from the negatively charged region in the P-
type, towards the positive region set up in the N-type.

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:30.840
So that’s our setup.

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:33.280
Now, how do you get energy from this?

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:35.440
On its own, it’s not going to do an awful
lot.

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:38.320
But electrons in a material can respond to
light.

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:43.320
When light hits them, the electrons interact
with the light and can even absorb some of
its energy.

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:47.420
If the bound electrons in the P-type absorb
energy from the light shining on the material,

00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:52.200
they can get just enough energy to stop being
bound to atoms and become free charges!

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:55.540
Remember that the charges across the gap set
up an electric field.

00:08:55.540 --> 00:09:05.820
Electric fields apply a force to free electric
charges, so an electron freed from the extra
energy it got from the light is now driven
by that electric field into the N-type.

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:08.720
That leaves a hole in the P-type waiting to
be filled,

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:14.200
but the electrons can’t flow back against the
electric field; the forces push it the other way around.

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:20.820
Instead, the N-type’s extra electron will
flow all the way around the circuit, through
the device, delivering electrical power.

00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:22.019
That’s a solar cell!

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:26.900
With the right arrangement of semiconductors,
it allows you to generate electricity from light.

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:30.699
These kinds of cells are exactly what form
the basis of solar panels.

00:09:30.699 --> 00:09:35.959
With semiconductors, and silicon in particular,
you can create electrical power from sunlight.

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:38.600
And I think you’ll agree, that’s a pretty
bright idea.

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:42.739
In this episode, we looked at silicon, and
how introducing small amounts of other elements

00:09:42.739 --> 00:09:47.309
allow silicon layers to conduct currents,
turning them into semiconductors.

00:09:47.309 --> 00:09:55.340
We saw how putting two different types – N and P
semiconductors – together gave us electrical
components like diodes, transistors, and solar cells.

00:09:55.340 --> 00:10:01.180
Next on our tour of materials engineering,
we’ll be going super tiny as we explore
the world of nanomaterials.
