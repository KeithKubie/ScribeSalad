00:00:01.368 --> 00:00:02.302
- [Voiceover] This episode
of CC: Social Scene

00:00:02.302 --> 00:00:03.437
is based on your suggestions

00:00:03.437 --> 00:00:05.639
from made up Ultimate
Frisbee moves.

00:00:05.639 --> 00:00:07.674
- [Voiceover] To sport is human,

00:00:07.674 --> 00:00:08.842
to win divine.

00:00:09.843 --> 00:00:13.213
Welcome to Sports five for five.

00:00:13.213 --> 00:00:16.383
- It was one of those
moments where you just know.

00:00:16.383 --> 00:00:19.820
This isn't a game
anymore, this is a sport.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.889
This is Ultimate Frisbee.

00:00:25.225 --> 00:00:27.060 line:0%
 
I remember I was
playing with Joe,

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.962
and we were getting
into it, you know?

00:00:28.962 --> 00:00:31.298
And then, Joe said something

00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:33.834
I'll never forget.

00:00:33.834 --> 00:00:35.636
- I was like, this is cool, but

00:00:35.636 --> 00:00:36.937
what if we made this cooler?

00:00:36.937 --> 00:00:39.640 line:0%
 
What if we made this ultimate?

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.375 line:0%
 
(techno beats)

00:00:41.375 --> 00:00:44.044 line:0%
 
- The Frisbee had been
around since 1938,

00:00:44.044 --> 00:00:45.479
but it was a toy.

00:00:46.847 --> 00:00:48.549 line:0%
 
Daryl Derbin and Joe
Butters looked at that disc

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:51.218
and saw something revolutionary.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.023 line:0%
 
- Basically, they
played Frisbee, but
they got real into it.

00:00:56.023 --> 00:00:58.258 line:0%
 
I mean, they would
throw it really hard,

00:00:58.258 --> 00:01:00.027
or do crazy throws.

00:01:00.027 --> 00:01:01.895
They invented crazy throws.

00:01:01.895 --> 00:01:03.664
- A lot of those moves
are still used today.

00:01:03.664 --> 00:01:05.232
The Flippity.

00:01:05.232 --> 00:01:07.601
- The Handful of Disc.

00:01:07.601 --> 00:01:08.769
- The Spinner.

00:01:08.769 --> 00:01:10.070
The Crash Helmet.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.538
The Teapot.

00:01:11.538 --> 00:01:12.706
- The Clothesline Tackle.

00:01:12.706 --> 00:01:14.942
(groaning in pain)

00:01:14.942 --> 00:01:17.544
- They would throw the
Frisbee while running.

00:01:17.544 --> 00:01:19.713
- No only did they throw crazy,

00:01:19.713 --> 00:01:21.849
they started
catching crazy, too.

00:01:21.849 --> 00:01:24.918
- Unnecessarily
complicated catching.

00:01:27.054 --> 00:01:28.856
And then they did something

00:01:28.856 --> 00:01:31.158
that nobody saw coming.

00:01:31.158 --> 00:01:34.328
They played Frisbee
against other people.

00:01:34.328 --> 00:01:35.963
(chanting "Go Blue")

00:01:35.963 --> 00:01:37.931
(screams)

00:01:37.931 --> 00:01:41.635
(players yelling they're open)

00:01:41.635 --> 00:01:42.469
- Oh, look at that!

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:43.737
Nope.

00:01:43.737 --> 00:01:46.240
I mean, before us, it
wasn't even a game.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.708
It was just a fun
activity you do

00:01:47.708 --> 00:01:50.010
with your family and
friends, you know, boring.

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:51.445
But, we took that fun activity

00:01:51.445 --> 00:01:53.113
and we made it into an intense,

00:01:53.113 --> 00:01:57.050
no holds barred, winner
take all competition!

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:58.585
- People would be like,

00:01:58.585 --> 00:02:00.320
"Don't think think you're
taking this too seriously?"

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.555
And, I would be like,

00:02:01.555 --> 00:02:04.024
"I think we're taking
this way too seriously!"

00:02:04.024 --> 00:02:06.793
(shouting and cheering)

00:02:06.793 --> 00:02:08.562
And, then it got big.

00:02:09.563 --> 00:02:10.697
Real big.

00:02:10.697 --> 00:02:12.266
(inspirational music)

00:02:12.266 --> 00:02:15.135
We made the cover of Disc
Weekly, the Frisbee Journal,

00:02:15.135 --> 00:02:17.371
Spokane Quarterly
Farmer's Almanac.

00:02:17.371 --> 00:02:20.574
And that's when Jenny
joined the league.

00:02:20.574 --> 00:02:22.109
- Joe and I felt that

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:24.178
Ultimate Frisbee would be
too dangerous for a lady.

00:02:24.178 --> 00:02:25.012
We were wrong.

00:02:25.012 --> 00:02:25.846
(sultry guitar solo)

00:02:25.846 --> 00:02:26.680
- Come on! Come on!

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:27.614
(screams)

00:02:27.614 --> 00:02:30.250
Yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah!

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.718
Watch it!

00:02:31.718 --> 00:02:33.787 line:0%
 
Yeah, you know my mom
wanted me to get married,

00:02:33.787 --> 00:02:35.322 line:0%
 
have kids. (scoffs)

00:02:35.322 --> 00:02:37.758
I was like, "Yeah right, I
gotta throw that Frisbee!"

00:02:37.758 --> 00:02:39.893
Is it you or me? You decide!

00:02:39.893 --> 00:02:40.727
Me! Me!

00:02:41.828 --> 00:02:43.197
This table came natural,
and you know what?

00:02:43.197 --> 00:02:44.631
It worked.

00:02:44.631 --> 00:02:45.465
Oh, yeah!

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.238
- And, this is when
things got really crazy.

00:02:51.238 --> 00:02:54.641
- The celebrity, the
fans, the need to win.

00:02:54.641 --> 00:02:56.543
(cheering)

00:02:56.543 --> 00:02:58.645
It was too much.

00:02:58.645 --> 00:03:00.814
- And, like all good things,

00:03:00.814 --> 00:03:01.982
it fell apart.

00:03:03.417 --> 00:03:06.320
- Darryl and I got caught
up in a tampering scam.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:07.254 line:0%
 
(police siren chirps)

00:03:07.254 --> 00:03:09.456 line:0%
 
- I told you, it's not my glue!

00:03:09.456 --> 00:03:10.324 line:0%
 
It's not my glue!

00:03:10.324 --> 00:03:11.158 line:0%
 
- Let's go.

00:03:11.158 --> 00:03:12.426 line:0%
 
- I want my lawyer!

00:03:12.426 --> 00:03:14.962
- They would put crazy
glue on their hands

00:03:14.962 --> 00:03:16.997 line:0%
 
so the discs would stick better.

00:03:16.997 --> 00:03:20.100 line:0%
 
It was a clear and frankly
obvious violation of the rules.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.202
And, out of respect for
this sweet game that I love

00:03:22.202 --> 00:03:23.270
more than anything,

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:24.404
I had to punish them.

00:03:24.404 --> 00:03:26.440
- You get addicted to winning.

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:27.941
I mean, I couldn't stop.

00:03:27.941 --> 00:03:28.942
(somber music)

00:03:28.942 --> 00:03:30.511
I'd hit rock bottom.

00:03:30.511 --> 00:03:33.580
I'd wake up with
glue on my hands.

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.684
And, that's when the league
came down hard on us.

00:03:39.119 --> 00:03:41.054
- It was the decision of
the league that the sport,

00:03:41.054 --> 00:03:43.857
as it stood, was too ultimate,

00:03:43.857 --> 00:03:46.193
and steps had to
be taken to make it

00:03:46.193 --> 00:03:47.361
less ultimate.

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:50.597
- They were out.

00:03:50.597 --> 00:03:54.801
The guys who started the
whole thing, just like that.

00:03:54.801 --> 00:03:57.738
- You know, I didn't
want them to go, but

00:03:57.738 --> 00:03:59.473
the game had changed.

00:04:01.041 --> 00:04:03.110
And, they cheated.

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:06.547
- Sure, the game is
still played today but

00:04:06.547 --> 00:04:08.682
it's not the same.

00:04:08.682 --> 00:04:10.617
It's not as ultimate.

00:04:10.617 --> 00:04:14.087
- Sometimes, life
throws you a curve ball.

00:04:14.087 --> 00:04:15.255
But sometimes,

00:04:16.657 --> 00:04:17.491
sometimes

00:04:19.426 --> 00:04:23.597
life throws you a
Frisbee. (chuckles softly)
