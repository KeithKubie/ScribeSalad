00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.830
As far as inputs are concerned, inputs acceptable to an abstract

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:10.370
specification must also be acceptable to the concrete implementation. However,

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:16.309
the refined operations, that is the implementation, can accept more.

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:22.100
This might happen if for example you use a particular library routine

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:27.670
that's very general to deal with satisfying some con,

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.790
some abstract need. Okay, you can accept more inputs, but

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:35.770
it has to accept at least as many as the abstract one requires of us.

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:41.340
In terms of our specification stated more precisely, refinements can weaken

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:47.630
operation preconditions. And in logic where every, concrete state T, if

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:53.610
the invariant is true an the, preconditions are true in the abstract state, then

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.100
it better be the case that the preconditions are true in the concrete state.
