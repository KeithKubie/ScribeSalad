00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:03.950
We've already seen how to
think about something like 64

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:05.340
to the 1/3 power.

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.630
We saw that this is
the exact same thing

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:11.630
as taking the cube root of 64.

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:14.090
And because we know
that 4 times 4 times

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:17.957
4, or 4 to the third
power, is equal to 64,

00:00:17.957 --> 00:00:19.665
if we're looking for
the cube root of 64,

00:00:19.665 --> 00:00:22.830
we're looking for a number that
that number times that number

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.935
times that same number is
going to be equal to 64.

00:00:24.935 --> 00:00:28.420
Well, we know that number is 4,
so this thing right over here

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.140
is going to be 4.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.220
Now we're going to
think of slightly more

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.710
complex fractional exponents.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.129
The one we see here has
a 1 in the numerator.

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:38.920
Now we're going to see
something different.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:46.470
So what I want to do is think
about what 64 to the 2/3 power

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:47.280
is.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.520
And here I'm going to use
a property of exponents

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.600
that we'll study more later on.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.580
But this property
of exponents is

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.610
the idea that-- let's say
with a simple number--

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.230
if I raise something
to the third power

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.160
and then I were to raise that
to, say, the fourth power,

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.720
this is going to be the same
thing as raising it to the 2

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.650
to the 3 times 4 power, or 2 to
the 12th power, which you could

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.410
also write as raising it to
the fourth power and then

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:15.160
the third power.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.410
All this is saying is, if I
raise something to a power

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.390
and then raise that
whole thing to a power,

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.000
it's the same thing as
multiplying the two exponents.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.950
This is the same thing
as 2 to the 12th.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.740
So we could use
that property here

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.777
to say, well, 2/3 is the
same thing as 1/3 times 2.

00:01:29.777 --> 00:01:31.360
So we could go in
the other direction.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:32.735
We could say, hey
look, well this

00:01:32.735 --> 00:01:36.070
is going to be the same
thing as 64 to the 1/3 power

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.154
and then that thing squared.

00:01:38.154 --> 00:01:39.820
Notice, I'm raising
something to a power

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.250
and then raising
that to a power.

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.875
If I were to multiply
these two things,

00:01:42.875 --> 00:01:46.310
I would get 64 to the 2/3 power.

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:47.850
Now, why did I do this?

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.554
Well, we already know what
64 to the 1/3 power is.

00:01:50.554 --> 00:01:51.470
We just calculated it.

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.190
That's equal to 4.

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.695
So we could say that--
and I'll write it

00:01:55.695 --> 00:01:57.870
in that same yellow
color-- this is

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:05.425
equal to 4 squared,
which is equal to 16.

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.234
So 64 to the 2/3
power is equal to 16.

00:02:11.234 --> 00:02:12.650
The way I think
of it, let me find

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.720
the cube root of 64, which is 4.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.190
And then let me square it.

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.940
And that is going
to get me to 16.

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.250
Now I'll give you in
even hairier problem.

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.510
And I encourage you to
try this one on your own

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.860
before I work through it.

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.440
So we're going to
work with 8/27.

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.790
And we're going to raise
this thing to the--

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:42.450
and I'll try to color code
it-- negative 2 over 3 power,

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.810
to the negative 2/3 power.

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.814
I encourage you to pause
and try this on your own.

00:02:48.814 --> 00:02:50.230
Well the first
thing I do whenever

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.120
I see a negative
exponent is to say, well,

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.720
how can I get rid of
that negative exponent?

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.219
And I just remind myself, well,
the negative exponent really

00:02:56.219 --> 00:02:57.840
just says, take the
reciprocal of this

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:58.881
to the positive exponent.

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.210
I'm using a different color.

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:09.240
I'm going to use that
light mauve color.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.950
So this is going to
be equal to 27/8.

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.660
I just took the reciprocal
of this right over here.

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.980
It's equal to 27/8 to
the positive 2/3 power.

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.560
So notice, all I did, I
got rid of the exponent

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.010
and took the reciprocal of
the base right over here.

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.630
8/27 is the base.

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.550
Negative 2/3 is the exponent.

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.900
Now, how can we handle this?

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.160
Well, we've already
seen that if I

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.890
have a numerator to some
power over a denominator

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.770
to some power-- and this is
another very powerful exponent

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:49.630
property-- this is going to be
the exact same thing as raising

00:03:49.630 --> 00:04:00.300
27 to the 2/3 power-- to
the 2 over 3 power-- over 8

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:01.320
to the 2/3 power.

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.300
This is another very
powerful exponent property.

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:09.300
Notice, if I have something
divided by something

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:10.980
and I'm raising the
whole thing to a power,

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.521
I can essentially
raise the numerator

00:04:12.521 --> 00:04:14.340
to that power over
the denominator raised

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:15.430
to that power.

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.714
Now, let's think
about what this is.

00:04:17.714 --> 00:04:19.130
Well just like we
saw before, this

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:20.930
is going to be the same thing.

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:29.060
This is going to be the same
thing as 27 to the 1/3 power

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:34.432
and then that squared
because 1/3 times 2 is 2/3.

00:04:34.432 --> 00:04:36.140
So I'm going to raise
27 to the 1/3 power

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:40.050
and then square
whatever that is.

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.539
All this color
coding is making this

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:43.830
have to switch a lot of colors.

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.620
This is going to be
over 8 to the 1/3 power.

00:04:51.829 --> 00:04:54.120
And then that's going to be
raised to the second power.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.995
Same thing we were doing
in the denominator--

00:04:55.995 --> 00:04:58.030
we raise 8 to the 1/3
and then square that.

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:59.370
So what's this going to be?

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:05.670
Well, 27 to the 1/3 power
is the cube root of 27.

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:08.060
It's some number-- that
number times that same number

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.580
times that same number is
going to be equal to 27.

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:13.010
Well, it might jump out at you
already that 3 to the third

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:17.350
is equal to 27 or that 27
to the 1/3 is equal to 3.

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:21.310
So the numerator, we're going
to end up with 3 squared.

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:23.730
And then in the
denominator, we are

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:27.050
going to end up with-- well,
what's 8 to the 1/3 power?

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:29.720
Well, 2 times 2 times 2 is 8.

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.825
So this is 8 to
the 1/3 third is 2.

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:36.430
Let me do that
same orange color.

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:41.160
8 to the 1/3 is 2, and then
we're going to square that.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.320
So this is going to
simplify to 3 squared

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:47.611
over 2 squared, which is just
going to be equal to 9/4.

00:05:47.611 --> 00:05:49.360
So if you just break
it down step by step,

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.535
it actually is not too daunting.
