you it would be better for you to be
 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:34.979
you it would be better for you to be
near such a person than near a person

00:00:34.979 --> 00:00:34.989
near such a person than near a person
 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:36.389

who had a different heat tolerance than

00:00:36.389 --> 00:00:36.399
who had a different heat tolerance than
 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:38.819

you did or for example if if there were

00:00:38.819 --> 00:00:38.829
you did or for example if if there were
 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:39.930
you did or for example if if there were
different kinds of foods in the

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:39.940
different kinds of foods in the
 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.779
different kinds of foods in the
environment some of which made you sick

00:00:42.779 --> 00:00:42.789
environment some of which made you sick
 

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:45.869

being with people who resembled you in

00:00:45.869 --> 00:00:45.879
being with people who resembled you in
 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:47.910
being with people who resembled you in
their tolerance for those foods would be

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:47.920
their tolerance for those foods would be
 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.279
their tolerance for those foods would be
advantageous because they would go to an

00:00:50.279 --> 00:00:50.289
advantageous because they would go to an
 

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:52.020
advantageous because they would go to an
environment where they could eat the

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030
environment where they could eat the
 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.319
environment where they could eat the
food and so could you eat the food so

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329
food and so could you eat the food so
 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.790
food and so could you eat the food so
hanging out with people you resemble is

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:56.800
hanging out with people you resemble is
 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.729
hanging out with people you resemble is
a kind of a way of probing your match

00:00:59.729 --> 00:00:59.739
a kind of a way of probing your match
 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:00.899
a kind of a way of probing your match
with the environment

if you preferentially attach to people

00:01:03.779 --> 00:01:03.789
if you preferentially attach to people
 

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:05.760
if you preferentially attach to people
that you resemble you will therefore be

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770
that you resemble you will therefore be
 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.800
that you resemble you will therefore be
more likely to be in an environment

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810
more likely to be in an environment
 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.420
more likely to be in an environment
which is good for you

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430
which is good for you

right now about a particular gene called
fox p2 some people think it plays a role

fox p2 some people think it plays a role
 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.910
fox p2 some people think it plays a role
in our evolution or speech some don't

but imagine that it does for the sake of
 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.480
but imagine that it does for the sake of
argument imagine you are the first

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490
argument imagine you are the first
 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:37.950
argument imagine you are the first
person on the planet to have a mutation

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960
person on the planet to have a mutation
 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.140

capacity for speech this mutation would
 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.670
capacity for speech this mutation would
be useless to you unless you had the

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680
be useless to you unless you had the
 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.870
be useless to you unless you had the
connected to someone you could talk to

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880
connected to someone you could talk to
 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.240
connected to someone you could talk to
it would be a little bit like being the

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250
it would be a little bit like being the
 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:52.860
it would be a little bit like being the

to email then all of a sudden it becomes
 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.010
to email then all of a sudden it becomes
very advantageous so this example too is

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020
very advantageous so this example too is
 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.050
very advantageous so this example too is
an example of why we might have evolved

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060
an example of why we might have evolved
 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.550
an example of why we might have evolved
the capacity or the interest in

preferentially hanging out with people
 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.839
preferentially hanging out with people
that we resemble and there are a number

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:09.849
that we resemble and there are a number
 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:12.000
that we resemble and there are a number
of advantages and disadvantages to this

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010
of advantages and disadvantages to this
 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.000
of advantages and disadvantages to this
tendency once it arises the advantages

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010
tendency once it arises the advantages
 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.140
tendency once it arises the advantages
include some of the things we've already

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150
include some of the things we've already
 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.760
include some of the things we've already
talked about

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770
talked about
 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.100
talked about
but they also include the ability of a

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110
but they also include the ability of a
 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.770
but they also include the ability of a
group of people of shared abilities and

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780
group of people of shared abilities and
 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.500
group of people of shared abilities and
interests to bond and work together to

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510
interests to bond and work together to
 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.960
interests to bond and work together to
achieve common objectives so for example

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970
achieve common objectives so for example
 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.690
achieve common objectives so for example
if I can hang out with people I resemble

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700
if I can hang out with people I resemble
 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.370
if I can hang out with people I resemble
who have similar tastes and abilities

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380
who have similar tastes and abilities
 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.230
who have similar tastes and abilities
that I do I kind of know on what to

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240
that I do I kind of know on what to
 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.940
that I do I kind of know on what to
count on you know if we're going out to

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950
count on you know if we're going out to
 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.980
count on you know if we're going out to
hunt big game and we all can run at the

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990
hunt big game and we all can run at the
 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.350
hunt big game and we all can run at the
same speed I kind of know that this

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360
same speed I kind of know that this
 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.710
same speed I kind of know that this
group can move at this pace for instance

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720
group can move at this pace for instance
 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.540
group can move at this pace for instance
but their disadvantages it well be as

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550
but their disadvantages it well be as
 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.250
but their disadvantages it well be as
well because once you form a group of

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260
well because once you form a group of
 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.900
well because once you form a group of
people who all resemble each other

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910
people who all resemble each other
 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.000
people who all resemble each other
you have no heterogeneity in skills

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010
you have no heterogeneity in skills
 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.220
you have no heterogeneity in skills
maybe what you really need is a group or

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230
maybe what you really need is a group or
 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.700
maybe what you really need is a group or
one person is is it can see far and can

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:55.710
one person is is it can see far and can
 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.220
one person is is it can see far and can
spot the prey and another person is

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230
spot the prey and another person is
 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.770
spot the prey and another person is
strong and can spear the prey and or

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780
strong and can spear the prey and or
 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.330
strong and can spear the prey and or
maybe you want heterogeneity of

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340
maybe you want heterogeneity of
 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.100
maybe you want heterogeneity of
information when you have groups that

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110
information when you have groups that
 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.170
information when you have groups that
are all very similar to each other when

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180
are all very similar to each other when
 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.450
are all very similar to each other when
groups form you get a kind of redundancy

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:08.460
groups form you get a kind of redundancy
 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.940
groups form you get a kind of redundancy
of information and no novelty everyone

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950
of information and no novelty everyone
 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.350
of information and no novelty everyone
is like do you know where the prey item

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360
is like do you know where the prey item
 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.940
is like do you know where the prey item
is do you know where the prey item is

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950
is do you know where the prey item is
 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.460
is do you know where the prey item is
everyone has the same information but

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470
everyone has the same information but
 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.470
everyone has the same information but
you would rather have a group of people

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480
you would rather have a group of people
 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.390
you would rather have a group of people
with different knowledge and different

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400
with different knowledge and different
 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.820
with different knowledge and different
skills who might be able to work

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830
skills who might be able to work
 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.520
skills who might be able to work
together to achieve common objectives so

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530
together to achieve common objectives so

natural selection across our evolution

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080
natural selection across our evolution
 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.490
natural selection across our evolution
has taken account of these advantages

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500
has taken account of these advantages
 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.330
has taken account of these advantages
and has shaped us too in general prefer

and has shaped us too in general prefer
 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:36.020
and has shaped us too in general prefer
homophony

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030
homophony
 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.450
homophony
but we don't always prefer homophily

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:38.460
but we don't always prefer homophily
 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:41.030

to push back against tribalism is to
 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.980
to push back against tribalism is to
step up from the tribalism and to
