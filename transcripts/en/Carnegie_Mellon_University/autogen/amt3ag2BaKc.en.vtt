together on a project so look at your
 

00:23:27.129 --> 00:23:28.470
together on a project so look at your
neighbors and think about whether you

00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:28.480
neighbors and think about whether you
 

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:29.539

the next thing we're so far out we're
 

00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:43.379
the next thing we're so far out we're
two versions ahead that's how

00:23:43.379 --> 00:23:43.389
two versions ahead that's how

progressive we want to be so we starting

00:23:45.570 --> 00:23:45.580
progressive we want to be so we starting
 

00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:46.830
progressive we want to be so we starting
to make a prototype we start writing

00:23:46.830 --> 00:23:46.840
to make a prototype we start writing
 

00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:48.629
to make a prototype we start writing
some code or building something and it

00:23:48.629 --> 00:23:48.639
some code or building something and it
 

00:23:48.639 --> 00:23:51.029
some code or building something and it
starts to go well so we we start to make

00:23:51.029 --> 00:23:51.039
starts to go well so we we start to make
 

00:23:51.039 --> 00:23:52.799
starts to go well so we we start to make
some other prototypes and then the

00:23:52.799 --> 00:23:52.809
some other prototypes and then the
 

00:23:52.809 --> 00:23:54.419
some other prototypes and then the
process of doing that some other people

00:23:54.419 --> 00:23:54.429
process of doing that some other people
 

00:23:54.429 --> 00:23:55.590

used by inventors so the view that we
 

00:32:03.759 --> 00:32:05.850

the lesson here is that the chronologies
 

00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:30.180
the lesson here is that the chronologies
are like the Epiphany trivia

about how that thing happened so you

00:32:35.399 --> 00:32:35.409
about how that thing happened so you

want to understand what the person who
got into the history book what did they

00:32:39.389 --> 00:32:39.399
got into the history book what did they
 

00:32:39.399 --> 00:32:39.810

taking away and the lesson here is a
 

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:14.460
taking away and the lesson here is a
very important lesson about innovation

00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:14.470
very important lesson about innovation
 

00:36:14.470 --> 00:36:16.349
very important lesson about innovation
because any innovation is effectively a

00:36:16.349 --> 00:36:16.359
because any innovation is effectively a
 

00:36:16.359 --> 00:36:18.930
because any innovation is effectively a
kind of change it is a kind of change or
