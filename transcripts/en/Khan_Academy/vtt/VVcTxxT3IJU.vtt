00:00:00.276 --> 00:00:01.637
- [Instructor] All of economics is based

00:00:01.637 --> 00:00:05.172
on this notion of scarcity of resources.

00:00:05.172 --> 00:00:06.270
What does scarcity mean?

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.211
Well, in an everyday context, it means

00:00:08.211 --> 00:00:10.263
that there's not as much of something,

00:00:10.263 --> 00:00:13.178
say, a resource, as people may need

00:00:13.178 --> 00:00:15.993
or there's not an unlimited
amount of something.

00:00:15.993 --> 00:00:17.326
So not unlimited

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:20.403
unlimited amount

00:00:22.291 --> 00:00:24.541
of a resource or resources.

00:00:25.806 --> 00:00:28.019
Resource, and I'll put a little,

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.980
resource or resources.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.491
And the common examples, especially

00:00:32.491 --> 00:00:34.339
in an academic economics class,

00:00:34.339 --> 00:00:36.360
when people are talking about scarcity,

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.391
the resource they're talking about,

00:00:38.391 --> 00:00:40.809
they'll often say land.

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:42.892
And by saying land,
they're speaking generally

00:00:42.892 --> 00:00:45.452
of natural resources.

00:00:45.452 --> 00:00:49.619
And so, examples of this
would be things like energy.

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.097
It could even be things like water.

00:00:54.097 --> 00:00:56.404
It could be lumber.

00:00:56.404 --> 00:01:00.984
It could be minerals,
maybe some type of metal.

00:01:00.984 --> 00:01:02.914
Obviously, it could be land itself.

00:01:02.914 --> 00:01:04.824
And you could see some of that depicted

00:01:04.824 --> 00:01:06.482
in a picture like this.

00:01:06.482 --> 00:01:09.740
Clearly, there's land here
and you can even argue

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.525
maybe, even the solar energy
that it has access to,

00:01:12.525 --> 00:01:16.304
that these would all be
broadly put into this category.

00:01:16.304 --> 00:01:18.550
Now another type of natural resource

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.017
that is often talked about
in an economics class

00:01:21.017 --> 00:01:22.184
will be labor.

00:01:23.667 --> 00:01:26.494
And labor we associate with people working

00:01:26.494 --> 00:01:28.921
and that is what labor
is making reference to.

00:01:28.921 --> 00:01:31.171
It's all about work effort.

00:01:32.833 --> 00:01:34.256
And we talk about work effort,

00:01:34.256 --> 00:01:35.830
we're talking about the workers

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:40.646
and how much they're
working, so hours of labor.

00:01:40.646 --> 00:01:41.896
Hours of labor.

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:44.953
And this picture right over here

00:01:44.953 --> 00:01:47.592
is a clear picture of some workers.

00:01:47.592 --> 00:01:51.324
Now, another resource that
you'll often talk about

00:01:51.324 --> 00:01:55.195
in the context of scarcity is capital.

00:01:55.195 --> 00:01:57.560
And capital can be a little
bit confusing at first.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.552
Well, it's things that people make

00:01:59.552 --> 00:02:02.092
in order to make other things.

00:02:02.092 --> 00:02:02.925
So things

00:02:04.907 --> 00:02:05.907
made to make

00:02:09.385 --> 00:02:10.468
other things.

00:02:12.271 --> 00:02:15.615
And so just to hit the point
home here, pause this video.

00:02:15.615 --> 00:02:19.282
In these pictures, what
capital do you actually see?

00:02:19.282 --> 00:02:20.867
Well, there's actually a bunch of capital

00:02:20.867 --> 00:02:22.240
in these pictures.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.640
There's some of the obvious
things like these tools,

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.518
this would be a clear example of capital.

00:02:28.518 --> 00:02:31.139
Even these buildings,
these buildings are used

00:02:31.139 --> 00:02:33.280
to maybe store animals or crops.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.999
So these are things that someone made

00:02:34.999 --> 00:02:37.112
in order to help make other things.

00:02:37.112 --> 00:02:38.848
And some of maybe, the less obvious things

00:02:38.848 --> 00:02:40.514
you might not even notice it at first

00:02:40.514 --> 00:02:41.906
but there's these power lines here.

00:02:41.906 --> 00:02:44.913
Someone made this in order
to help us distribute energy

00:02:44.913 --> 00:02:47.329
which could be used to make other things.

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:49.309
So that too could be used,

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:51.797
that could be an example of capital here.

00:02:51.797 --> 00:02:55.105
Now the fourth resource that
you'll hear folks talk about

00:02:55.105 --> 00:02:57.285
is really thinking about
well how do we know

00:02:57.285 --> 00:03:00.588
how to combine these first
three types of resources

00:03:00.588 --> 00:03:04.651
and we could call that entrepreneurship.

00:03:04.651 --> 00:03:06.068
Entrepreneurship.

00:03:07.494 --> 00:03:10.970
Sometimes people will refer to technology

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.600
but this is all how to combine,

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:14.767
how to combine

00:03:17.085 --> 00:03:18.519
all of the above right over here,

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:20.551
one through three, these types

00:03:20.551 --> 00:03:22.806
of resources right over here.

00:03:22.806 --> 00:03:25.772
Someone had to decide that
hey these were good places

00:03:25.772 --> 00:03:27.743
to put these storage houses.

00:03:27.743 --> 00:03:30.890
Someone had to decide where
to put the power lines.

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.353
Someone had to decide
what crops to plant here

00:03:34.353 --> 00:03:35.452
and how to plant them.

00:03:35.452 --> 00:03:37.841
Someone had to decide,
well, what type of labor

00:03:37.841 --> 00:03:39.736
do we need, what type of land,

00:03:39.736 --> 00:03:41.620
what type of capital, the
actual factory building,

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.600
the factory equipment do we need

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.210
in order to produce whatever these folks

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:47.753
are producing right over here.

00:03:47.753 --> 00:03:49.471
And that general notion,

00:03:49.471 --> 00:03:51.594
you could talk about as entrepreneurship.

00:03:51.594 --> 00:03:52.815
And so the big picture here

00:03:52.815 --> 00:03:54.327
is think about the world around you.

00:03:54.327 --> 00:03:56.754
There's not an unlimited amount of land,

00:03:56.754 --> 00:03:58.045
especially if you're thinking about land

00:03:58.045 --> 00:03:59.244
for a specific purpose.

00:03:59.244 --> 00:04:01.753
There's not an unlimited
amount of natural resources,

00:04:01.753 --> 00:04:04.506
energy, lumber, some type of metal,

00:04:04.506 --> 00:04:06.346
there's not an unlimited amount of labor,

00:04:06.346 --> 00:04:09.069
there's only so many people who exist,

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:11.434
and there's not an
unlimited amount of capital,

00:04:11.434 --> 00:04:12.979
we don't have an infinite
number of buildings

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:15.510
or equipment, and we don't have

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.216
an infinite amount of entrepreneurship,

00:04:17.216 --> 00:04:18.537
we can only have so much energy

00:04:18.537 --> 00:04:21.796
to think about how do we put
these other things together.

00:04:21.796 --> 00:04:23.300
So I will leave you there

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.226
and as we go further in
our quest in economics,

00:04:26.226 --> 00:04:29.526
we're gonna see the scarcity
of these four resources

00:04:29.526 --> 00:04:31.859
show up over and over again.
