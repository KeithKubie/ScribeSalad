would probably before hijacking planes

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610
would probably before hijacking planes
 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.060
would probably before hijacking planes
and flying them into buildings before

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070
and flying them into buildings before
 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.619
and flying them into buildings before
that would be putting a bomb in the

building yes it's not that easy see like

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360
building yes it's not that easy see like
 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.850
building yes it's not that easy see like
when you see what would happen in

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860
when you see what would happen in

they would they said that if you look at

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910
they would they said that if you look at
 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.299
they would they said that if you look at
the amount of damage that did and look

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309
the amount of damage that did and look
 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.190
the amount of damage that did and look
at where the blast radius is from the

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200
at where the blast radius is from the
 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.730
at where the blast radius is from the
way he blows out it doesn't blow they're

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740
way he blows out it doesn't blow they're
 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:11.990
way he blows out it doesn't blow they're
not designed it and you're saying yeah

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000
not designed it and you're saying yeah
 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.280
not designed it and you're saying yeah
that's building because we've all seen

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290
that's building because we've all seen
 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.289
that's building because we've all seen
the loose change work you watch the

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299
the loose change work you watch the
 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.030
the loose change work you watch the
lights go off around the building yeah

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040
lights go off around the building yeah
 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.990
lights go off around the building yeah
like one floor by one yeah but see they

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000
like one floor by one yeah but see they
 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.730
like one floor by one yeah but see they
don't know that see they don't know what

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740
don't know that see they don't know what
 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.800
don't know that see they don't know what
that means though that also could be if

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810
that means though that also could be if
 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.830

the ceiling is coming in and slamming

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840
the ceiling is coming in and slamming
 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.350
the ceiling is coming in and slamming
into the floor all the windows would do

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360
into the floor all the windows would do
 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.819
into the floor all the windows would do
that they don't know that that's

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829
that they don't know that that's
 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.460
that they don't know that that's
explosions if it really was collapsing

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470
explosions if it really was collapsing
 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.350
explosions if it really was collapsing
like that see no one's ever seen a

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360
like that see no one's ever seen a
 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.120
like that see no one's ever seen a
building collapse like that so when they

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130
building collapse like that so when they
 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.100
building collapse like that so when they
say that those are blips and those are

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110
say that those are blips and those are
 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.380
