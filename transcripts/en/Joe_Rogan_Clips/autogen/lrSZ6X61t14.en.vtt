00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020
with yeah the only way this all gets
 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.690
with yeah the only way this all gets
sorted out is we get to figure out a way

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700
sorted out is we get to figure out a way
 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.070

to express ourselves and there's gonna

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080
to express ourselves and there's gonna
 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.260
to express ourselves and there's gonna
be arguments back and forth but what you

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270
be arguments back and forth but what you
 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:17.630
be arguments back and forth but what you
got to do is someone's got to put forth

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640
got to do is someone's got to put forth
 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.510
got to do is someone's got to put forth
an educated plan like a plan that's

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:20.520
an educated plan like a plan that's
 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.360
an educated plan like a plan that's
based on science and reason and a plan

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370
based on science and reason and a plan
 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.310

that you can debate against opposers of

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320
that you can debate against opposers of
 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.110
that you can debate against opposers of
that plan but when you have people that

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120
that plan but when you have people that
 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.240
that plan but when you have people that
don't believe in science a lot of how do

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250
don't believe in science a lot of how do
 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.610
don't believe in science a lot of how do
you how do you totally but surely you

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620
you how do you totally but surely you
 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.530
you how do you totally but surely you
have to get there it's gonna take

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540
have to get there it's gonna take
 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.330
have to get there it's gonna take
