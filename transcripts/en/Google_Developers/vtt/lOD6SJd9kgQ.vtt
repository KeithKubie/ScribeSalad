TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello, and
welcome to the Developer Show.

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.580
Remember to use the
nav bar at the bottom

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.500
to skip to your favorite
topic at any point.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.240
Now let's start with the TLDR.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.050
Use the Unity game engine
to build games for the TV

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:14.940
with the new Google Cast Remote
Display plug-in for Unity.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.160
The Google Cast
Remote Display APIs

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.290
use the powerful GPUs, CPUs, and
sensors of your Android or iOS

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:24.270
mobile device to render a local
display on your mobile device

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.200
and a remote display on your TV.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.950
Leon is going to join
us later on the show

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:28.890
to give us more details.

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.045
LEON NICHOLLS: Great to be here.

00:00:30.045 --> 00:00:31.930
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Learn how
to build, update, and use

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.550
containers on the Google Cloud
Platform with this tutorial

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:35.784
by Julia Ferraioli.

00:00:35.784 --> 00:00:37.950
It's a four-part series of
blog posts that gives you

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.910
a great hands-on
introduction using

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.330
something familiar to many of
us, running a Minecraft server.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.350
I know it's familiar
to all of us.

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.430
Build powerful applications that
can see and, more importantly,

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.790
understand the
content of images.

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.310
This functionality is now
available in the Google Cloud

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:55.280
Vision API.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.239
Rob Craft is on the show
today to tell us more.

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.571
ROB CRAFT: Thanks for having me.

00:00:58.571 --> 00:01:00.790
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Tap4Fun
increased their game's rating

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.060
of a 4.0 by using
the review system

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.469
to address user problems,
as well as beta testing

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:07.010
to improve the
quality of their games

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.580
from within the Google
Play Developer Console.

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.660
Find out how in this video
with Tap4Fun's CEO, founder,

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.780
and their creative director.

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.660
Learn more about the
improvements to Sign-In

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.940
with Google with this
latest post in a series

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:19.930
by Laurence Moroney.

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.380
He talks about changes
to basic sign-in flow,

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.960
silent sign-in, and
customizing the Sign-In button.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.000
Understand what users' Google
searches drive into your app,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.140
as well as how
those users behave

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.920
once they're in your app using
Deep Link Referrer Analytics.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.250
Hey, a new version of
Chrome, just like clockwork.

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.270
The latest beta includes Present
to Cast, custom notification

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.100
buttons, and network estimation.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.250
The Google Maps SDK
for iOS has been

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.240
updated to include bit
code support, new events,

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.240
and some features
previously only available

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.840
in the Android SDK.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.820
All that and more today
on the Developer Show.

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.660
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:04.107 --> 00:02:05.940
Let's start the show
by talking about games.

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.940
Leon Nicholls, a developer
programs engineer

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.032
worked on the Google Cast Remote
Display plug-in for Unity.

00:02:11.032 --> 00:02:12.115
Leon, welcome to the show.

00:02:12.115 --> 00:02:12.830
LEON NICHOLLS: Thank you.

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.663
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So tell
us a little bit what

00:02:14.663 --> 00:02:18.440
is the plug-in, maybe what is
Unity for those few people that

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.590
don't know what it is, and
a little bit about the API

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.680
for Google Cast, the
remote display API.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:24.430
LEON NICHOLLS: OK.

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.850
So Unity is a very popular game
engine used by a lot of games.

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.120
And what we launched
last week was a plug-in

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.800
that allows you to take our
remote display technology

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.449
and take your game, your mobile
game, and make it run on a TV.

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:38.240
TIMOTHY JORDAN: OK.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.323
So you already got a mobile
game running on Unity,

00:02:40.323 --> 00:02:43.000
and you just sort of expand
that into the living room.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.380
LEON NICHOLLS: That's right.

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:44.790
ROB CRAFT: So you're
curing my back problems--

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:45.530
LEON NICHOLLS: Yeah.

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:46.180
ROB CRAFT: [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.380
Nice.

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.910
LEON NICHOLLS: We'll see.

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:47.380
ROB CRAFT: Nice.

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.838
LEON NICHOLLS: So this is great
for the living room, right.

00:02:49.838 --> 00:02:52.380
You can take your existing
game and just add the plug-in

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.070
and use our technology
to render that on the TV.

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:00.120
And we support all the popular
platforms, Android and iOS.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.995
And it's really
easy to integrate.

00:03:01.995 --> 00:03:04.370
So we've launched a sample
[? app. ?] We've also launched

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.330
a [? code ?] [? lab ?], and some
updates to our UX guidelines

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.550
to make sure that you
create a great Cast game.

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:11.700
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Awesome.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:12.200
Great.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.050
So, one last thing is about
the Cast Remote Display APIs.

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:17.860
And I think something
people might not

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.880
know is the real power of
these, aside from just taking

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.420
your existing came and kind
of expanding it to the TV,

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:25.540
not having to learn
a new thing, is

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.950
you get to take advantage of
all the hardware on the phone.

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:28.370
LEON NICHOLLS: Yes.

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:29.745
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
So you don't have

00:03:29.745 --> 00:03:32.080
to rely on the hardware of
whatever Google Cast device

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:37.006
you might be using, but
rather the GPUs and the CPUs

00:03:37.006 --> 00:03:38.630
in the phones that
people are upgrading

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:39.670
every year or two anyway.

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:40.461
LEON NICHOLLS: Yes.

00:03:40.461 --> 00:03:43.680
So you can now render great
animation, great graphics,

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.016
great sound, and put that on
a very low-end Cast device

00:03:47.016 --> 00:03:47.765
like a Chromecast.

00:03:47.765 --> 00:03:48.940
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's awesome.

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:49.440
All right.

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:50.334
Thanks, Leon.

00:03:50.334 --> 00:03:52.500
Have you ever wondered how
you can use notifications

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.720
to build a deeper
relationship with your user

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.072
instead of pushing them away?

00:03:56.072 --> 00:03:58.530
I caught up with Chris Wren at
the Android Developer Summit

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.731
to learn how.

00:04:00.731 --> 00:04:01.230
Hi, there.

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:02.630
I'm sitting here
with Chris Wren.

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:04.950
He's a staff software
engineer here at Google,

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.220
although if you looked
at his business card,

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.865
it would say maker.

00:04:06.865 --> 00:04:07.280
CHRIS WREN: It does.

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.280
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Because
you make things.

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.700
CHRIS WREN: Because I
make things, that's right.

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.227
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Today we can
talk a little bit about making

00:04:12.227 --> 00:04:13.310
things with notifications.

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.936
You gave a talk here at Android
Dev Summit about notifications.

00:04:15.936 --> 00:04:17.519
You should check it
out for more info.

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.700
But there's a couple things
I wanted to touch upon,

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.034
first of which-- and I think
this gets glossed over when

00:04:22.034 --> 00:04:23.950
developers start to think
about notifications,

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:24.992
is like why do they care?

00:04:24.992 --> 00:04:26.450
CHRIS WREN: I think
what developers

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:28.140
don't think about is
that notifications

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:31.130
are the first place often the
users come into their phone.

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.710
And that's your
opportunity to build trust,

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.560
to deliver information
that they need

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.492
and they can act
upon, and not just do

00:04:37.492 --> 00:04:39.450
something that's obviously
for your own benefit

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:40.390
and the benefit of your app.

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:41.820
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So it's
about building trust

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.440
in a relationship
with the user, really.

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:44.140
CHRIS WREN: Yeah, I think so.

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:45.110
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So when
you think about, like,

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:47.034
the notifications that
you give your user,

00:04:47.034 --> 00:04:48.700
you shouldn't just
think about how do I,

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:52.180
like, uptick that graph of
user attention, like entry.

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.350
I mean, because one of
the things you talk about

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:57.520
in your talk is that
uninstalling an app

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:58.880
is really only a click away.

00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:59.040
CHRIS WREN: Right.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.954
If you're not delivering
value to the user,

00:05:00.954 --> 00:05:02.430
then why are you there?

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:03.576
Why are you in my pocket?

00:05:03.576 --> 00:05:04.450
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yeah.

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:04.830
So--

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:06.940
CHRIS WREN: So imagine
an SMS app that said hey,

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.815
you'll never guess what
message you just got.

00:05:08.815 --> 00:05:09.790
That would be terrible.

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:11.320
You would install that,
like, in an instant.

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.260
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And what would
be the better alternative

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:14.140
than the SMS app there?

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:15.790
CHRIS WREN: Well obviously,
you should give the user

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:16.873
the information they need.

00:05:16.873 --> 00:05:17.920
Like, don't tease them.

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.250
Like, show them the message.

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:21.150
Maybe even give them
some actions about,

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:22.190
oh, I don't need to
deal with this now.

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:22.880
Like, snooze.

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.607
Tell me that later or something.

00:05:24.607 --> 00:05:25.940
Let them get on with their life.

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:27.110
Let them manage their life.

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:28.540
They'll come back if
they're happy with the app.

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:30.340
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Everybody,
please check out

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:32.160
Chris's excellent
talk on notifications

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.930
so that you can build a great,
trustworthy relationship

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:36.550
with your user from the get-go.

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:37.150
Thanks, Chris.

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:37.941
CHRIS WREN: Thanks.

00:05:37.941 --> 00:05:38.736
Thank you.

00:05:38.736 --> 00:05:40.110
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
Next on the show,

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:42.680
let's talk about the
Cloud Vision API.

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:45.520
Rob Craft, a products manager
for the Google Cloud platform,

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:46.730
joins us on the show today.

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:47.310
ROB CRAFT: Great to be here.

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:49.685
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So let's talk
about the Cloud Vision API.

00:05:49.685 --> 00:05:52.590
Now, in particular, we recently
announced this and the internet

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:54.850
is abuzz with excitement.

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:58.270
I mean, the Cloud Vision
API is a really awesome tool

00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:59.652
for developers.

00:05:59.652 --> 00:06:01.360
First, I'd love to
know a little bit more

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.070
about the technology behind it
and what it gives developers,

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:06.270
and then move into
talking about use cases.

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:08.185
What can be done with this API?

00:06:08.185 --> 00:06:12.170
ROB CRAFT: So Vision API you
can look at as a very easy way

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:15.180
to use machine learning to
do a whole different class

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:16.460
of application.

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:19.300
So machine learning is all
about training models, forming

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:21.556
models, massaging
data for models.

00:06:21.556 --> 00:06:23.180
There's models, is
what I'm getting at.

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:26.120
So inside of that space,
there's a lot of PhDs,

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.460
there's a lot of lab coats.

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:29.242
Frankly, at Google,
we spend a lot of time

00:06:29.242 --> 00:06:30.700
building out
infrastructure for it.

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:32.920
Vision API makes it very simple.

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:34.790
You send us an
image, we send you

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:36.510
back what you asked
for, whether it

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:38.770
was sentiment analysis
on who's smiling or not

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:40.990
smiling in the photo,
what is actually there,

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:42.990
like all the way down
to genus of plant

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:45.470
sometimes, what the
composition of the photo

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:47.730
is-- it a happy space,
an unhappy space--

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:50.270
those sorts of things
that we think really

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:52.470
transform what a
developer can do today

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:53.740
versus what they used to do.

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:57.280
A great scenario that we
talked about a couple of times

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:00.650
is the idea of if you're
shooting video for a show,

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:02.720
you might have the
opportunity to say, well,

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:06.050
I don't want to have to go
through and manually plumb who

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:07.960
or where people were
in a particular shot,

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:09.935
or what was on stage
at a particular time.

00:07:09.935 --> 00:07:11.520
It'd be great if I
were able to feed

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:13.350
keystone images
into a system and it

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:14.500
spits it back out for me.

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:16.860
Because imagine you're running
commercials for 50 shows

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:17.560
a week.

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:19.560
It's a workload that isn't
all that interesting.

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:21.020
So how do we fix that for you.

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:24.760
So the Vision API really enables
that across a lot of new areas.

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:26.704
There's tons of amazing
scenarios coming.

00:07:26.704 --> 00:07:28.870
So it's going to be really
interesting in six months

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:29.660
when people are done.

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:31.743
LEON NICHOLLS: So this is
great for app developers

00:07:31.743 --> 00:07:33.970
like me, because if I have
to make sense of an image,

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:35.260
I don't really know
where to begin.

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.660
So now you're telling me Google
will just do that work for me?

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:38.530
That's really great.

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:40.300
ROB CRAFT: The trick
inside of the box

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:42.160
is we keep it out
of your vision.

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:43.890
So we want to make
it very simple.

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:45.880
So machine learning
is a tough space.

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:47.960
It's hard to simplify
too much about losing

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:49.180
the baby and the bathwater.

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:51.399
We want to make it just
very, very simple for you.

00:07:51.399 --> 00:07:53.190
TIMOTHY JORDAN: You
know, this is something

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:55.010
we were talking about before
the show, which I think

00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:56.490
is really interesting
when you look

00:07:56.490 --> 00:07:58.900
at machine learning
and its growing

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:01.030
popularity in the
developer space,

00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:04.570
I think a big part of that is
that it's becoming accessible,

00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:06.340
that APIs and tools
are coming out

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:08.690
to allow developers to
integrate this in their app

00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:12.704
without the PhD in cognitive
sciences and mathematics

00:08:12.704 --> 00:08:14.870
to be able to build these
things from the ground up.

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:15.570
ROB CRAFT: Yep.

00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:19.432
The core technologies that come
from our own research group

00:08:19.432 --> 00:08:21.890
have been used in other areas
inside of Google for a while.

00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:23.431
And how we optimize
our own business,

00:08:23.431 --> 00:08:25.470
like Search or
Photos, do a great job

00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:29.020
of taking the tensor flow
kind of modeling capabilities

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:31.690
and using it to solve
our own problem set.

00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:33.960
We're in the cloud platform
business in Google Cloud,

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:36.110
so we try to make it
simple for everybody else

00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:38.630
to get the same experience,
and tooling it down

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:41.174
to a level where you don't have
to have your PhD in the space

00:08:41.174 --> 00:08:42.340
really makes the difference.

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:43.130
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Awesome.

00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:43.539
Thanks.

00:08:43.539 --> 00:08:44.120
Thanks, Rob.

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:44.860
ROB CRAFT: Sure.

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:45.250
TIMOTHY JORDAN: OK.

00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:47.333
Let's get to the final
question of our show, which

00:08:47.333 --> 00:08:50.540
is how will you use the Google
Cloud Vision API to make

00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:51.910
your holidays better.

00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:53.940
And extra points for silliness.

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:56.960
ROB CRAFT: So there's the
Charlie Brown Christmas, right.

00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:58.140
Everyone knows this.

00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:02.220
So, are the children really
that depressed and unhappy?

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:03.962
Let's see what Vision
API has to say.

00:09:03.962 --> 00:09:06.460
TIMOTHY JORDAN: OK.

00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:07.105
Leon.

00:09:07.105 --> 00:09:09.230
LEON NICHOLLS: So, OK, this
might be a bit serious,

00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:12.187
but I think I'm going to use
the Vision API to let Google

00:09:12.187 --> 00:09:14.020
watch movie trailers
for me and then tell me

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:15.462
which movies to watch.

00:09:15.462 --> 00:09:16.960
Am I going to watch
the "Star Wars"

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:18.690
movie or the "Chipmunks" movie?

00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:20.090
It comes out on the same day.

00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:21.720
TIMOTHY JORDAN: They
come out on the same day?

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:22.900
How are we going to decide?

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:23.680
ROB CRAFT: Doubleheader.

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:24.570
LEON NICHOLLS: Don't know.

00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:25.750
ROB CRAFT: Clearly
a doubleheader.

00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:26.770
TIMOTHY JORDAN: All right,
guys, thanks for joining us

00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:27.305
on the show today.

00:09:27.305 --> 00:09:27.975
LEON NICHOLLS: Sure.

00:09:27.975 --> 00:09:29.840
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hey,
you've got questions.

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:31.910
Turns out we've got
answers in our new segment

00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:33.160
called Ask Dev Show.

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:38.010
This isn't a selfie stick.

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:39.810
It's an answer
machine for questions

00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:41.470
that only a Googler can answer.

00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:44.810
Ask me almost anything in the
comments or on social media,

00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:46.360
and I'll get you your answer.

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:48.510
Smash on Twitter asked
if I could find out

00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:49.803
what's in the box.

00:09:49.803 --> 00:09:51.735
Reto.

00:09:51.735 --> 00:09:52.500
RETO: Timothy.

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:53.520
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
This is your office.

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:54.890
RETO: This is
absolutely my office.

00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:55.540
TIMOTHY JORDAN: This
is not your office.

00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:56.500
RETO: This is
completely my office.

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:58.440
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Nothing
is plugged in down there,

00:09:58.440 --> 00:09:59.731
and you're watching cat videos.

00:09:59.731 --> 00:10:00.981
RETO: Uh-- how can I help you?

00:10:00.981 --> 00:10:02.647
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Maybe
it is your office.

00:10:02.647 --> 00:10:03.440
What's in the box?

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:04.130
RETO: Which box?

00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:05.671
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That
box right there.

00:10:05.671 --> 00:10:07.942
RETO: Oh.

00:10:07.942 --> 00:10:08.900
The Android Studio Box.

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:09.720
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yes.

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:10.425
RETO: Android Studio 2.0--

00:10:10.425 --> 00:10:10.900
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Shiny.

00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:12.190
RETO: Right on top here.

00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:12.880
Instant Run.

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:14.760
New Emulator. [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:16.830
TIMOTHY JORDAN: What's
that in the corner there?

00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:17.795
Oh, that's--

00:10:17.795 --> 00:10:19.220
RETO: Uh, that's--

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:19.970
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Can
we-- that's pretty-

00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:20.370
RETO: That's not important.

00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:21.680
No, you don't have to-- don't
have to worry about that.

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:22.240
TIMOTHY JORDAN: We can't
talk about that yet?

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:22.980
RETO: We can't talk about that.

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:23.870
TIMOTHY JORDAN: OK.

00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:26.060
Well, that's what's in the
box, or at least as much

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:27.130
as we can talk about.

00:10:27.130 --> 00:10:30.780
