00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
In Unit 5 we briefly mentioned dead reckoning.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Dead reckoning is the method that mariners used to use to estimate their position at sea.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
They did this by keeping a log book of the direction they were heading,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
they speed they were moving at, and the duration that they moved at that speed and direction.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
In one particular journey where a ship wants to get from start to finish

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
the ship starts out by going east at a speed of 12 k/h for 2.5 hours.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
The ship then heads south at 20 m/h for 1 hour,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.000
east at 15 m/h for 3 hours and then finally northeast at 8 k/h for 1 hour.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
My question is what's the straight-line distance between start and finish.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
By straight-line distance, I mean this distance from start to finish.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Not the total distance the ship traveled, because the ship took a slightly inefficient route.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Now, this is a sort of tricky problem, but as long as you keep track of your trignometry

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and geometry, and you will have to make some right triangles,

00:01:02.000 --> 99:59:59.000
you'll be able to get this one right. Enter your answer here in kilometers.
