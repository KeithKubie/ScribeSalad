00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:04.170
NARRATOR: Andros Island,
the Bahamas, 2003.

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.000
Members of the Association
for Research and Enlightenment

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.210
conduct aerial searches
for underwater structures

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:14.880
that might reveal evidence
of a lost civilization.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.710
Off of the coast
of Andros, they

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.170
discovered an
incredible platform

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.250
of rectangular and square
stones that stretched

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.540
for several hundred yards.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.250
And all the indications
are that it goes back

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.250
to the end of the last ice
age and is probably around

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.080
11,000 to 12,000 years old.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.040
NARRATOR: The search is
part of a long-term project

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.170
working in conjunction
with the Cayce Foundation.

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.920
Their quest is to locate
remnants of the lost continent

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.250
of Atlantis, which healer
and psychic Edgar Cayce

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.710
said would be
located in the area.

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.250
DAVID WILCOCK: Edgar
Cayce is arguably

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.420
America's greatest psychic.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.750
He was born in
1877, died in 1945.

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.540
And he has documented over
14,000 psychic readings.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.250
What's interesting is
that Cayce also got

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.540
into things like reincarnation.

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.540
Some of Cayce's
clients were told

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.750
that they had lifetimes in the
so-called mythical civilization

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.460
of Atlantis.

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.460
In fact, Cayce's readings said
that the people of Atlantis,

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.540
as a whole, had
mass reincarnated

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.920
as the people of America, and
that America was, in a sense,

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.120
a future life
carryover of Atlantis.

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.750
NARRATOR: Cayce revealed
in his psychic readings

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.460
that the truth about the nature
of this lost civilization

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.920
exists in a hidden
hall of records

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.420
at three locations
across the globe--

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.790
in Egypt, near the Sphinx;
underwater in the Bahamas;

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.420
and in the Yucatan Peninsula.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.460
Any three of these
areas apparently

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.290
would have all of the
records that we would need

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.460
to completely
rebuild our history

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.920
and understand
how there may have

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.500
been much more widespread
extraterrestrial presence here

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.120
on Earth.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.080
NARRATOR: Could recent
archaeological finds

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.290
in the Bahamas confirm
that Edgar Cayce was

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.210
right about the
existence of a lost

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:32.790
extraterrestrial civilization?

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.170
And if so, should we be
concerned about his predictions

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.960
for the future of humanity?

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.380
Cayce was a cataclysmist.

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.290
And in his readings,
he was constantly

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.120
talking about Earth
changes and pole

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.000
shifts that caused
civilizations to be

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.880
destroyed in ancient times.

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.710
And Cayce said
that we were going

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:01.620
to have another pole
shift around the time

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.830
of the millennium.

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.710
Even a relatively
small asteroid

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:10.000
coming in at the right angle--

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.540
not necessarily hitting
Earth, but grazing the Earth--

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.580
could theoretically change
the tilt axis of the Earth

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:18.920
significantly.

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.580
Now, if that occurred,
land and ocean would

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.710
redistribute on the Earth.

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:30.420
WILLIAM HENRY: It seems as
if history repeats itself.

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.170
And it may be that,
at this moment,

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.330
we are exactly in
the same situation

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:39.040
that the citizens
of Atlantis were in.

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.830
ANDREW COLLINS: Perhaps we
will find out exactly what had

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.000
happened to this
lost civilization

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.120
and learn from their mistakes
and not sink into oblivion

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.620
ourselves.

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.120
GIORGIO A. TSOUKALOS:
The more we uncover,

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.290
it will all point
in one direction.

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:02.420
We are not the first,
and we never have been.

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:05.620
An extraterrestrial
pre-civilization existed

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.210
before our recorded history.

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:13.380
And this truth will be
revealed within our lifetime.

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:18.420
NARRATOR: Could the
stories of a time when

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:22.250
gods and other worldly
beings inhabited the Earth

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.580
be more than just mythology?

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.710
And might the discovery
of unexplainable remnants

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.460
from this lost civilization
reveal the truth

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.460
about our
extraterrestrial origins,

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:40.000
as ancient astronaut
theorists suggest?

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.170
Perhaps we are on the verge
of uncovering the final piece

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:48.000
of the puzzle that will
change our understanding

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.620
of Earth's history forever.

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:55.170
But will we uncover it
before it's too late?

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:58.330
