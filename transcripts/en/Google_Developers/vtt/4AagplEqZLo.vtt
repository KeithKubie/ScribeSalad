00:00:01.764 --> 00:00:02.680
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello.

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:03.490
I'm Timothy Jordan.

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:05.823
And this is your update about
the coolest developer news

00:00:05.823 --> 00:00:07.190
from Google in the last week.

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:09.290
If awesome developer
updates are your thing,

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:11.220
make sure to subscribe.

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.060
We believe that AI
technologies are

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.750
likely to be overwhelmingly
useful and beneficial

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:16.650
for humanity.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.630
But part of being a responsible
steward of any new technology

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:21.730
is thinking through
potential challenges

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.040
and how to best address
any associated risks.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.860
So we published a technical
paper, "Concrete Problems

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:30.870
in AI Safety," which was a
collaboration among scientists

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:34.390
at Google, OpenAI,
Stanford, and UC Berkeley.

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.360
The post has an overview
and a link to the paper.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.370
And if that paper
isn't enough, check out

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.220
this list of our
research being presented

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.930
at the 2016 International
Conference on Machine Learning.

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.090
With Chrome 52, we're
introducing the ability

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.430
to make storage persistent.

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.100
For more details and some
code, check out the post.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.140
Also in Chrome 52, WebRTC uses
a much more efficient and secure

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.620
algorithm for certificate
generation, ECDSA.

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.519
And RTC certificates can now
be stored with indexed DB.

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.040
There's a post with details
and code on this too.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.530
Building an
authentication system

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.030
is, well, bothersome
to say the least.

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.300
However, with Firebase
Authentication,

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.760
you can outsource the
entire thing to Firebase

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.820
so that you can
concentrate on building

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.030
great features for your app.

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.037
Visit the post for
details and examples.

00:01:25.037 --> 00:01:26.620
OK, so if you're
watching this, you're

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.720
probably already an
amazing developer.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.790
But perhaps you have a friend
who has a great idea for an app

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.510
but doesn't know where
to start and keeps

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:35.560
bugging you to do it for them.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.630
Enter the Android
Basics Nanodegree.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.300
This series of
courses and services

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.330
teaches your friend how to
build simple Android apps,

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.820
even if they have little or
no programming experience.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.770
Also in the Getting
Started category,

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.570
we're excited to announce
Google Cloud Platform education

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.890
grants for computer science
faculty and students.

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.790
Faculty in the US who teach
courses in computer science

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.020
or related subjects can apply
for free credits for students

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.330
to use across the full
complement of Google Cloud

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:04.660
Platform tools.

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:06.652
And they can be used
anytime during the 2016

00:02:06.652 --> 00:02:10.020
to 2017 academic year.

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.360
Mobirix saw about a 15% uplift
in the number of paying users

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.900
and about a 43% increase in
average revenue per paying user

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.180
after implementing a
hybrid monetization

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.600
model of in-app payments and
ads for its apps on Beehive.

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.620
Learn more from the
post linked below.

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.300
Adults are 30% more likely to
prefer online video platforms

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.940
over TV when given a choice
where to watch video content.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.520
This and other insights are
now available in a study

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.700
from comScore,
commissioned by Google

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.067
and available at the link below.

00:02:43.067 --> 00:02:45.150
Check it out for six things
to keep in mind as you

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.920
develop your 2017 media plan.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.056
Have I mentioned recently
that you should subscribe

00:02:50.056 --> 00:02:51.430
to this channel
so you don't miss

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.290
any of the developer
awesomeness happening at Google?

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:55.400
I have?

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.490
OK, cool.

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:57.490
I'm Timothy Jordan.

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:59.030
And I'll see you next week.

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.280
